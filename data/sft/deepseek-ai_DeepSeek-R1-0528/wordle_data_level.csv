 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has three vowels and two common consonants. I'll go with ""ROAST"".

 R, O, A, S, T are all common letters. This might give us good information.

We are given feedback for our first guess ""roast"": R(x) O(x) A(x) S(x) T(x)
 This means that none of the letters R, O, A, S, T are in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, we must avoid using any of these letters in our next guess.

 Considering that, we need to choose a word that uses different letters. We should pick common letters that haven't been tried.

 The remaining vowels are E, I, U (since A and O are out). Consonants: we have many left like B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Since we have no correct letters, we want to maximize new information. So we should include more common vowels and consonants.

 Common letters in English: E, I, L, N, U, etc. We can also consider words with repeated letters? But typically for second guess we avoid repeats since we have 5-letter unique words? Actually, Wordle allows repeated letters but in this case, since we haven't seen any, maybe we avoid for now.

 A good candidate might be ""CLINE"". However, C and L are common. Alternatively, ""DEUCE"" has two E's and U. But it has E twice? Maybe let's pick a word without repeats.

 Another idea: ""PLUCK"" uses P, L, U, C, K. But U is a vowel? Or we can choose ""NYMPH"" but it has Y (which can be vowel) and is not very common.

 Important: We need to cover as many common letters as possible.

 Common letters remaining: E (most common), then I, L, N, U, D, M, H, C, etc.

 I propose a word that uses E and I (vowels) and three common consonants: L, N, D, H, C, etc.

 Example: ""LINED"" -> L, I, N, E, D. This gives us two vowels (I, E) and three consonants (L, N, D).

 But note: we have already eliminated R,O,A,S,T so we must avoid them.

 Alternatively, ""CHIME"": C, H, I, M, E. This covers E, C, H, I, M.

 Another one: ""LEECH"" but it has repeated E? And H at end. Better to avoid repeats? Yes, because we don't know if there is repetition.

 Let me choose ""CHIME"". It has C, H, I, M, E. All new letters and covers common vowels and consonants.

 But note: there might be a word that covers more frequent letters? E, I are high frequency.

 Alternatively, ""QUERY"" but Q is rare and we have eliminated R? R is already eliminated so we must not use R.

 Another candidate: ""FILCH"" has F, I, L, C, H. F is less common? Maybe skip.

 How about ""MEDIC""? M, E, D, I, C. That's M, E, D, I, C. Also good because it covers E and I.

 Let me choose ""MEDIC"". It uses M, E, D, I, C.

 However, note that ""CHIME"" is also good. I'll go with ""MEDIC"" because D and C are very common.

 Wait, another idea: ""PINEY"", but Y is sometimes vowel and we haven't tested Y? But we are avoiding R,O,A,S,T so P,I,N,E,Y. But Y is the last letter and might be less common? Actually, Y is common in words as a vowel.

 But let me stick to ""MEDIC"".

 Alternatively, ""ELUDE""? E, L, U, D, E. Wait, repeated E? Not allowed? The rules don't say repeated letters are disallowed, but in the guess we can have repeated letters? However, the word must be valid. But for efficiency, we might want to avoid repeats to cover more letters.

 Since we didn't get any positive feedback, we want to test as many new letters as possible. Therefore, we should avoid repeating letters in this guess?

 Absolutely. So ""ELUDE"" has two E's so it's not ideal. Similarly, ""LEECH"" is no.

 So ""MEDIC"" is unique letters: M, E, D, I, C.

 Therefore, I choose ""MEDIC"".

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""roast"" – where none of the letters (R, O, A, S, T) are in the secret word – we need to avoid those letters entirely in our next guess. 

To maximize information, we should test new common vowels and consonants. The word ""**medic**"" incorporates:
- **M, E, D, I, C**: These are high-frequency letters (avoiding the eliminated ones)  
- Covers 2 new vowels (E, I) and 3 new consonants (M, D, C)  
- Helps quickly check if any of these dominant letters appear in the secret word

The word ""**medic**"" incorporates:\n- **M, E, D, I, C**: These are high-frequency letters (avoiding the eliminated ones)  \n- Covers 2 new vowels (E, I) and 3 new consonants (M, D, C)  \n- Helps quickly check if any of these dominant letters appear in the secret word  \n\nThis strategic guess narrows possibilities while adhering to the feedback.\n\n<guess>medic</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: roast -> FEEDBACK: R(x) O(x) A(x) S(x) T(x)\nGuess 2: medic -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(✓) D(x) I(x) C(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have two guesses and their feedback:
1. ""roast"" -> all letters incorrect: R, O, A, S, T are not in the word at all.
2. ""medic"" -> M(x), E(✓), D(x), I(x), C(x). 
   - This means that only E is in the word and it's in the correct position. Specifically, E is the second letter because in ""medic"":
        Position 1: M -> x
        Position 2: E -> ✓ -> so the secret word has E as the second letter.
   - The other letters M, D, I, C are not in the word at all.

Therefore, we know:
- The second letter is E.
- Letters that are definitely not in the word: R, O, A, S, T, M, D, I, C.

Available letters: We can use any letters except those excluded: R,O,A,S,T,M,D,I,C.

We need to form a 5-letter word where:
- The second letter is E.
- The word must not contain any of the excluded letters.

Common letters left: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. And we have vowels: U and Y (since A, E, I, O are used; note E is placed but cannot use I or O or A). But wait E is placed so we have E in the word, but we can use other vowels? Actually, we have to use new letters that aren't excluded.

Vowels available: U (and sometimes Y, W act as vowels). We can use U and Y.

Structure: The word is: ? E ? ? ?

We need to choose a word that uses only remaining letters: 
Available: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to cover common letters to gather more information. Common consonants: H, L, N, P, etc.

Possible guesses:

Let's list some words that fit:
- HAVE: H, A, V, E -> but A is excluded (from first guess). Invalid.
- HAVE is no because A is excluded.

We need words without A, and without the other excluded letters.

Examples:
- JEWEL: J, E, W, E, L -> but second letter is E? Actually: J(1), E(2), W(3), E(4), L(5). So position 2 is E. But note it has E twice. Also, letters: J, W, E, L. E is already known, so we are testing J, W, L. However, E appears again? But we don't know if E repeats. We are allowed to guess repeated letters? The rules don't forbid it, but since E is already known to be in position 2, it might be redundant? Not necessarily, if E appears twice we can get a - or ✓ for the second E? However, currently we only know one E. But if we guess a word with two E's, we can test if there is a second E.

But we need to avoid excluded letters. Checking: J is available, E is allowed (but we know it's in position 2, so position 4 if we put E would be another test), W, L.

But note: E in position 4: if the secret word does not have E in position 4, but has E elsewhere, we might get a - sign? Actually, the feedback would say - if it's somewhere else? But we already have E in position 2 correct. However, we are testing for other letters too.

But let's avoid repeats for now? Because we want to maximize the number of new letters? Since we don't know, maybe keep it simple.

Another word: ""LEECH"" -> L, E, E, C, H -> but C is excluded? C was in the excluded list from guess 2.

No, C is excluded (from ""medic"": C(x)).

So let's avoid using E again if possible? To test more letters.

Options:
- ""FEIGN"" -> F, E, I, G, N -> I is excluded? From guess 2: I(x). So I is excluded? Yes, because I got x.

Excluded letters: R, O, A, S, T, M, D, I, C.

So in ""FEIGN"": I is excluded -> invalid.

- ""NEVER"" -> N, E, V, E, R -> but R is excluded? R was in first guess with x -> invalid.

- ""HELP"" -> H, E, L, P -> only 4 letters? Must be 5 letters.

We need 5-letter words.

Perhaps:
- ""BEVEL"": B, E, V, E, L -> uses E twice? But B, V, L are new.
But E appears at position 2 and position 5? Positions: B(1), E(2), V(3), E(4), L(5). Actually, position 4 would be E? But we are going to have position 2 E known, so we are testing B, V, L at positions 1,3,5 and also testing if position 4 is E? That might be inefficient because if we don't get a second E, it doesn't help as much? But we can try.

However, we are allowed to do so.

Another word: ""FJELD"" -> F, J, E, L, D -> D is excluded? From guess 2, D(x) -> invalid.

Let's find words that only use available letters: B, F, G, H, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z and the vowel U or Y? And not using E again? But E is in a known position so we can skip other E? Or we can use E? Actually, we might want to test for repetition? Since we don't know.

Alternatively, avoid E repetition for more coverage? We have few guesses left.

Another candidate: ""BLEWY"" -> not valid? Let's list:

""BEVY"" is not 5 letters.

Actually: 
- ""LEVEL"" -> L,E,V,E,L -> but L repeated? And position 2 is E -> good? But V is included. However: letters: L, E, V -> but V, L are new? And we test if E is at position 4? And L at beginning and end? But it has two L's and two E's? Also, L and E are being tested? However, we don't know if L is in the word? Actually, the secret word might have L? We haven't tested.

But the excluded letters: we cannot use R,O,A,S,T,M,D,I,C -> LEVEL uses L, E, V -> L and V are allowed.

But: positions:
Position 1: L -> new
Position 2: E -> ✓ (we know)
Position 3: V -> new
Position 4: E -> we don't know? This would test position 4.
Position 5: L -> same as position 1? So if L is in the word? But wait, testing two positions for L? Might be useful.

But the word ""level"" is valid? Well, LEVEL is a word.

Alternatively, let me try ""BLEEP"" -> B, L, E, E, P -> valid? But P is allowed? And E at 3rd and 4th? Actually position 2: we are expecting E -> so we need to have E at position 2? No: the structure we need is any second letter E.

For ""BLEEP"": positions are B(1), L(2), E(3), E(4), P(5) -> but position 2 is L? It must be E? So that guess would be invalid? Because we don't have E in the second position? For our guess, we must have E in the second position? Because we know that the secret word has E as the second letter? So in our guess, we must put E in the second position? Otherwise, we might get a - or x for E? But the feedback for E would be - if it's in another position? But we want to use the known E to keep position 2 correct? Actually, we can change? But it's not necessary? Because if we put E elsewhere and get ✓, we would know? But we only know position 2 has E? So we can try putting E at another position? However, to maximize efficiency, we can perhaps keep position 2 as E? That way we have 4 other positions? Or we can move E to test? But since we don't know if there is another E, we can try.

But it might be better to have position 2 fixed as E to lock that position? Then test other letters? Then we know always one letter is E and in place? So we can focus on the rest.

Given that, let's fix position 2 as E and choose other letters from the available pool.

So guess: [first] E [third] [fourth] [fifth]

Letters: first, third, fourth, fifth must be from {B, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z} excluding already excluded? As above, as long as not in excluded letters.

Common combinations: 
- Words like ""BELOW"" -> but O is excluded? O is excluded? From first guess: O(x) -> invalid.
- ""BEING"" -> I excluded? From guess 2 -> invalid.
- ""HONEY"" -> O excluded? Invalid.
- ""KEYED"" -> E at fourth? Also D excluded -> invalid.

Try ""LENES"" -> L,E,N,E,S -> S excluded? From first guess? S(x) -> invalid.

Another: ""BELLE"" -> B, E, L, L, E -> repeated E and L? And second letter E? Positions: B(1), E(2), L(3), L(4), E(5). Uses B, L, E -> L is new? So we test B and L? But two L's.

Better words?
How about ""UVEA"" -> too short.

Perhaps: ""QUEUE"" -> Q, U, E, U, E -> second position E? No, position 1:Q,2:U, etc -> not E in second?

Need word: _ E _ _ _

Options:
- ""FEIGN"" -> not allowed because I excluded? Yes.
- ""NEIGH"" -> N, E, I, G, H -> I excluded? Invalid.

Without I: 
- ""LEGAL"" -> L,E,G,A -> but A excluded? Invalid.

Available vowels: U and Y.

So words with U or Y in them? Or all consonants?

Example: ""DEUCE"" -> D excluded? Invalid.
- ""YEUKY"" -> not valid word.

""YEXES"" -> but X and S? S excluded.

Common word: ""HONEY"" -> O excluded? No, O is excluded.

Another: ""FLUKE"" -> F, L, U, K, E -> but E at fifth? We have E at position 2 -> so we need E at position 2? But FLUKE has E at position 5? So to avoid having E at all? Or have at position 2? If we use FLUKE, position 2 is L, which we don't know? Then feedback: position 5 E might be ✓ or x? But we know E is in the word? So if we put E at position 5, it might get ✓ if it is indeed there? But we also have position 2? We don't know position 2? We do know position 2 is E? So it's better to use a word that has E at position 2? To keep that spot? Otherwise, we lose a chance? Or get more info?

Let me clarify: the secret word has E in position 2? So if we guess a word without E at position 2, then E (if at position 5) might get marked with - or ✓? If at position 5, ✓ would mean the secret has E at position 5? But we already know E at position 2? So the word could have two E's? Or if we don't have E at position 2, then we'd get feedback that position 2 is not E? But it is E in the secret? So that would be wasteful? Because we already know it's E? So we always want E at position 2? To lock that? Then we don't have to retest? And we focus on the other letters? Yes.

Therefore, we stick with having E in position 2? So the guess must have the second letter E? Then we can concentrate on discovering the other letters? So all guesses going forward should have E in position 2? Until we know more? Or we have the full word.

So: guess pattern: [letter] E [letter] [letter] [letter]

We need to pick word of the form X E Y Z W.

Available letters: all except excluded: R,O,A,S,T,M,D,I,C.

So available: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,N,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

We also have to avoid using excluded letters? And we want to cover common letters to narrow down.

Let me list possible words:
- ""BELOW"": includes O -> excluded? O is excluded -> no.
- ""BENCH"": C excluded? C from ""medic"" got x -> excluded? So invalid.
- ""FENCE"": E? But in addition to position 2? And C excluded? Invalid.
- ""JELLY"": J,E,L,L,Y -> Y at the end? And L repeated. But letters: J,L,Y -> new? So valid? Word.

JELLY: J,E,L,L,Y -> positions: J(1),E(2),(L at 3 and 4), Y(5). But it has two L's? We can do that? The word is acceptable? But we risk that L might be in the word once? But if it isn't, we duplicate? Or we can get feedback.

Another: ""LEVEL"" -> L,E,V,E,L -> but E at 4? Will be tested? And V? Levels? Valid? But E is at 2 and 4? Which we already know for position 2? So we can test if E is at position 4? And V and L? But we have two L's? Might be inefficient? Especially since we have limited guesses.

Better to pick a word with entirely new letters? Covering as many new common letters as possible.

Available: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,N,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Common letters: L, H, N, P, U, B, etc.

How about ""BLUEY""? Not valid? ""BLEAK"" -> A excluded? Invalid.

""PLUME"": P,L,U,M,E -> M excluded? From ""medic"": M(x)? M is excluded? Invalid.

""FUNKY"": F,U,N,K,Y -> all new? And not excluded? F,U,N,K,Y are not excluded. Second letter E needed? ""FUNKY"" is F, U, N, K, Y? Position 2 is U? but we need position 2 to be E? So not this word? Because we want E at position 2? So we cannot just have any word? Must have E at position 2.

Correct form is X E Y Z W.

""FUNKY"" doesn't have E.

What about:
- ""QUEEN"": Q,U,E,E,N -> good? Positions: Q(1), U(2)? U at position 2? We need E at position 2? But ""queen"" has E at position 3 and 4? Not position 2? So wrong pattern? We require the second letter to be E? But ""queen"" has second letter U? So it would be: positions:1:Q,2:U,3:E,4:E,5:N? Then feedback for E? We know secret has E at position 2? So if we guess ""queen"", position 2 U: if U is not in word? x? And E would be marked at position 3 and 4: if at position 3? But secret has E only at position 2? Then position 3 E might be x? Then position 2 U gets x? But we know position 2 is E? So that guess wastes position 2? We might still get U? Or not? The feedback for position 2 U will be ""x"" because the secret has E at position 2? Not U? So position 2: U is not E and U is not in the word? It would get x? Then positions 3 and 4, E would be at? But we know E is only at position 2? But secret might have more E's? If secret has E at position 3 as well? That's possible? But currently we only know position 2 E? So we don't know about others? Therefore, guessing a word without E at position 2 could be useful if we also include E elsewhere? To test for multiple E's? But it may not be efficient with only 6 tries? It's risky? Also, in this case, we would get position 2 U: if we guess ""queen"", feedback might be: position 1 Q? Then U? which will be x because position 2 must be E? Then E at position 3 or 4, if secret has E at position 3, it would be marked as - or ✓? But we don't know if secret has E elsewhere? So we can test? But we have E at position 2 confirmed? And we don't know about other positions? So perhaps we can use other guesses? But since we have 4 tries left? Maybe we stick to having E at position 2? So we can focus on the first, third, fourth, fifth letters? And not test E again? Or only if convenient? But let's focus on the available letters.

A good word: ""PENAL"": P,E,N,A,L -> but A excluded? From the first feedback? A(x) -> invalid.

""NEXUS"": N,E,X,U,S -> S excluded? Invalid.

""BELCH"": B,E,L,C,H -> C excluded? Invalid.

How about ""YEH"" -> not 5 letters.

""WEEDY"": W,E,E,D,Y -> D excluded? D(x) -> invalid.

""VERGE"": V,E,R,G,E -> R excluded? Invalid.

This is difficult.

Let's think of words with common available letters: U, L, N, H, etc.

""EU K something"" but second letter E: so words like:
- ""LEGER"": L,E,G,E,R -> R excluded? Invalid.
- ""HEDGE"": H,E,D,G,E -> D excluded? Invalid.
- ""LEVEL"" we thought earlier? But let's try something without excluded letters.

Available: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,N,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

For example:
- ""FILE"" -> not 5 letters.
- ""FILEK"" -> ""fickle"" -> but ""fickle"" has I? I excluded? Invalid.

""JUKE"": not 5.

""BEGUN"": B,E,G,U,N -> letters: B,G,U,N -> all available? And structure: B(1),E(2),G(3),U(4),N(5) -> so ""begun"" is a word? Yes. B E G U N.

Letters: B,G,U,N are all new and available.

This is good? We haven't used any of these before? And not excluded.

So we can guess ""begun""? And check.

""Begun"" meets all criteria? Position and letters are from available set.

Another candidate: ""HELIX"": H,E,L,I,X -> I excluded? I got x? Invalid.

""VENUE"": V,E,N,U,E -> E at position 2 and 5? And U? Let's see: letters: V,N,U,E -> E is already known? And U? But ""venue"" structure: V(1),E(2),N(3),U(4),E(5). So we are testing V, N, U? And E at position 5? Which is new? But V,N,U are available? And E is known? So valid? But we are using E twice? That might be OK? But it could reveal if there's more than one E? However, we don't have a better choice? Alternatively, ""begun"" avoids doubling E.

Also, ""begun"" tests B,G,U,N? And not E repetition? Better? Since letters are different.

Similarly, ""P G U N something"" -> ""begun"" is one.

""JEG U something"" not common.

""VEGUN"" not a word.

So ""begun"" seems valid: B E G U N.

Alternatively, ""BEVAN"" is not common? ""Bevel"" -> B,E,V,E,L -> has E twice? And L? Available? But E at position 4? And V? Also good.

But ""begun"" covers G and U? Also new.

Another option: ""LEVIN"": L,E,V,I,N -> I excluded? Invalid.

""KELPY"": K,E,L,P,Y -> K,L,P,Y available? Yes? And E at position 2? So ""K E L P Y"" -> positions.

Both ""begun"" and ""kelpy"" are possible? Let's see: ""kelpy"" is a word? Yes, meaning a brown algal.

Which is better? ""begun"" has B,G,U,N? ""kelpy"" has K,L,P,Y? What letters are more common? In English, L is common, P is common, K, Y? U is common vowel? But U is less common than L? L is very common? Perhaps ""kelpy"" covers common letters? U is also common.

But to decide? We have to pick one.

In ""kelpy"" we have Y at the end? Which is also worth testing? But we don't know.

Also, ""begun"" has more vowels? U in position 4? But in the secret word, we know the second letter is E? And we don't know if there are other vowels? U could be there? But consonants? Both options have two vowels? E and U in ""begun""? In ""kelpy"" has E and Y? With Y acting as vowel.

But ""begun"" uses U which is a vowel? And we don't have U tested? So good.

But whichever, both are valid? I choose ""begun"" for simplicity? Since it doesn't repeat E.

So guess: ""begun""

<guess>begun</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback:
- Guess 1 (""roast"") eliminated R, O, A, S, T.
- Guess 2 (""medic"") shows E as correct in position 2 and eliminates M, D, I, C.
- Excluded letters: R, O, A, S, T, M, D, I, C.
- Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- Secret word format: _ E _ _ _.

To maximize information from new letters, the next guess uses B, G, U, and N (common letters from the available pool) while fixing E in position 2. ""Begun"" is a valid 5-letter word that fits this structure and tests new vowels and consonants. It avoids reused or excluded letters.

<guess>begun</guess>",begun,"We have two guesses and their feedback:
1. ""roast"" -> all letters incorrect: R, O, A, S, T are not in the word at all.
2. ""medic"" -> M(x), E(✓), D(x), I(x), C(x). 
   - This means that only E is in the word and it's in the correct position. Specifically, E is the second letter because in ""medic"":
        Position 1: M -> x
        Position 2: E -> ✓ -> so the secret word has E as the second letter.
   - The other letters M, D, I, C are not in the word at all.

Therefore, we know:
- The second letter is E.
- Letters that are definitely not in the word: R, O, A, S, T, M, D, I, C.

Available letters: We can use any letters except those excluded: R,O,A,S,T,M,D,I,C.

We need to form a 5-letter word where:
- The second letter is E.
- The word must not contain any of the excluded letters.

Common letters left: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. And we have vowels: U and Y (since A, E, I, O are used; note E is placed but cannot use I or O or A). But wait E is placed so we have E in the word, but we can use other vowels? Actually, we have to use new letters that aren't excluded.

Vowels available: U (and sometimes Y, W act as vowels). We can use U and Y.

Structure: The word is: ? E ? ? ?

We need to choose a word that uses only remaining letters: 
Available: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to cover common letters to gather more information. Common consonants: H, L, N, P, etc.

Possible guesses:

Let's list some words that fit:
- HAVE: H, A, V, E -> but A is excluded (from first guess). Invalid.
- HAVE is no because A is excluded.

We need words without A, and without the other excluded letters.

Examples:
- JEWEL: J, E, W, E, L -> but second letter is E? Actually: J(1), E(2), W(3), E(4), L(5). So position 2 is E. But note it has E twice. Also, letters: J, W, E, L. E is already known, so we are testing J, W, L. However, E appears again? But we don't know if E repeats. We are allowed to guess repeated letters? The rules don't forbid it, but since E is already known to be in position 2, it might be redundant? Not necessarily, if E appears twice we can get a - or ✓ for the second E? However, currently we only know one E. But if we guess a word with two E's, we can test if there is a second E.

But we need to avoid excluded letters. Checking: J is available, E is allowed (but we know it's in position 2, so position 4 if we put E would be another test), W, L.

But note: E in position 4: if the secret word does not have E in position 4, but has E elsewhere, we might get a - sign? Actually, the feedback would say - if it's somewhere else? But we already have E in position 2 correct. However, we are testing for other letters too.

But let's avoid repeats for now? Because we want to maximize the number of new letters? Since we don't know, maybe keep it simple.

Another word: ""LEECH"" -> L, E, E, C, H -> but C is excluded? C was in the excluded list from guess 2.

No, C is excluded (from ""medic"": C(x)).

So let's avoid using E again if possible? To test more letters.

Options:
- ""FEIGN"" -> F, E, I, G, N -> I is excluded? From guess 2: I(x). So I is excluded? Yes, because I got x.

Excluded letters: R, O, A, S, T, M, D, I, C.

So in ""FEIGN"": I is excluded -> invalid.

- ""NEVER"" -> N, E, V, E, R -> but R is excluded? R was in first guess with x -> invalid.

- ""HELP"" -> H, E, L, P -> only 4 letters? Must be 5 letters.

We need 5-letter words.

Perhaps:
- ""BEVEL"": B, E, V, E, L -> uses E twice? But B, V, L are new.
But E appears at position 2 and position 5? Positions: B(1), E(2), V(3), E(4), L(5). Actually, position 4 would be E? But we are going to have position 2 E known, so we are testing B, V, L at positions 1,3,5 and also testing if position 4 is E? That might be inefficient because if we don't get a second E, it doesn't help as much? But we can try.

However, we are allowed to do so.

Another word: ""FJELD"" -> F, J, E, L, D -> D is excluded? From guess 2, D(x) -> invalid.

Let's find words that only use available letters: B, F, G, H, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z and the vowel U or Y? And not using E again? But E is in a known position so we can skip other E? Or we can use E? Actually, we might want to test for repetition? Since we don't know.

Alternatively, avoid E repetition for more coverage? We have few guesses left.

Another candidate: ""BLEWY"" -> not valid? Let's list:

""BEVY"" is not 5 letters.

Actually: 
- ""LEVEL"" -> L,E,V,E,L -> but L repeated? And position 2 is E -> good? But V is included. However: letters: L, E, V -> but V, L are new? And we test if E is at position 4? And L at beginning and end? But it has two L's and two E's? Also, L and E are being tested? However, we don't know if L is in the word? Actually, the secret word might have L? We haven't tested.

But the excluded letters: we cannot use R,O,A,S,T,M,D,I,C -> LEVEL uses L, E, V -> L and V are allowed.

But: positions:
Position 1: L -> new
Position 2: E -> ✓ (we know)
Position 3: V -> new
Position 4: E -> we don't know? This would test position 4.
Position 5: L -> same as position 1? So if L is in the word? But wait, testing two positions for L? Might be useful.

But the word ""level"" is valid? Well, LEVEL is a word.

Alternatively, let me try ""BLEEP"" -> B, L, E, E, P -> valid? But P is allowed? And E at 3rd and 4th? Actually position 2: we are expecting E -> so we need to have E at position 2? No: the structure we need is any second letter E.

For ""BLEEP"": positions are B(1), L(2), E(3), E(4), P(5) -> but position 2 is L? It must be E? So that guess would be invalid? Because we don't have E in the second position? For our guess, we must have E in the second position? Because we know that the secret word has E as the second letter? So in our guess, we must put E in the second position? Otherwise, we might get a - or x for E? But the feedback for E would be - if it's in another position? But we want to use the known E to keep position 2 correct? Actually, we can change? But it's not necessary? Because if we put E elsewhere and get ✓, we would know? But we only know position 2 has E? So we can try putting E at another position? However, to maximize efficiency, we can perhaps keep position 2 as E? That way we have 4 other positions? Or we can move E to test? But since we don't know if there is another E, we can try.

But it might be better to have position 2 fixed as E to lock that position? Then test other letters? Then we know always one letter is E and in place? So we can focus on the rest.

Given that, let's fix position 2 as E and choose other letters from the available pool.

So guess: [first] E [third] [fourth] [fifth]

Letters: first, third, fourth, fifth must be from {B, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z} excluding already excluded? As above, as long as not in excluded letters.

Common combinations: 
- Words like ""BELOW"" -> but O is excluded? O is excluded? From first guess: O(x) -> invalid.
- ""BEING"" -> I excluded? From guess 2 -> invalid.
- ""HONEY"" -> O excluded? Invalid.
- ""KEYED"" -> E at fourth? Also D excluded -> invalid.

Try ""LENES"" -> L,E,N,E,S -> S excluded? From first guess? S(x) -> invalid.

Another: ""BELLE"" -> B, E, L, L, E -> repeated E and L? And second letter E? Positions: B(1), E(2), L(3), L(4), E(5). Uses B, L, E -> L is new? So we test B and L? But two L's.

Better words?
How about ""UVEA"" -> too short.

Perhaps: ""QUEUE"" -> Q, U, E, U, E -> second position E? No, position 1:Q,2:U, etc -> not E in second?

Need word: _ E _ _ _

Options:
- ""FEIGN"" -> not allowed because I excluded? Yes.
- ""NEIGH"" -> N, E, I, G, H -> I excluded? Invalid.

Without I: 
- ""LEGAL"" -> L,E,G,A -> but A excluded? Invalid.

Available vowels: U and Y.

So words with U or Y in them? Or all consonants?

Example: ""DEUCE"" -> D excluded? Invalid.
- ""YEUKY"" -> not valid word.

""YEXES"" -> but X and S? S excluded.

Common word: ""HONEY"" -> O excluded? No, O is excluded.

Another: ""FLUKE"" -> F, L, U, K, E -> but E at fifth? We have E at position 2 -> so we need E at position 2? But FLUKE has E at position 5? So to avoid having E at all? Or have at position 2? If we use FLUKE, position 2 is L, which we don't know? Then feedback: position 5 E might be ✓ or x? But we know E is in the word? So if we put E at position 5, it might get ✓ if it is indeed there? But we also have position 2? We don't know position 2? We do know position 2 is E? So it's better to use a word that has E at position 2? To keep that spot? Otherwise, we lose a chance? Or get more info?

Let me clarify: the secret word has E in position 2? So if we guess a word without E at position 2, then E (if at position 5) might get marked with - or ✓? If at position 5, ✓ would mean the secret has E at position 5? But we already know E at position 2? So the word could have two E's? Or if we don't have E at position 2, then we'd get feedback that position 2 is not E? But it is E in the secret? So that would be wasteful? Because we already know it's E? So we always want E at position 2? To lock that? Then we don't have to retest? And we focus on the other letters? Yes.

Therefore, we stick with having E in position 2? So the guess must have the second letter E? Then we can concentrate on discovering the other letters? So all guesses going forward should have E in position 2? Until we know more? Or we have the full word.

So: guess pattern: [letter] E [letter] [letter] [letter]

We need to pick word of the form X E Y Z W.

Available letters: all except excluded: R,O,A,S,T,M,D,I,C.

So available: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,N,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

We also have to avoid using excluded letters? And we want to cover common letters to narrow down.

Let me list possible words:
- ""BELOW"": includes O -> excluded? O is excluded -> no.
- ""BENCH"": C excluded? C from ""medic"" got x -> excluded? So invalid.
- ""FENCE"": E? But in addition to position 2? And C excluded? Invalid.
- ""JELLY"": J,E,L,L,Y -> Y at the end? And L repeated. But letters: J,L,Y -> new? So valid? Word.

JELLY: J,E,L,L,Y -> positions: J(1),E(2),(L at 3 and 4), Y(5). But it has two L's? We can do that? The word is acceptable? But we risk that L might be in the word once? But if it isn't, we duplicate? Or we can get feedback.

Another: ""LEVEL"" -> L,E,V,E,L -> but E at 4? Will be tested? And V? Levels? Valid? But E is at 2 and 4? Which we already know for position 2? So we can test if E is at position 4? And V and L? But we have two L's? Might be inefficient? Especially since we have limited guesses.

Better to pick a word with entirely new letters? Covering as many new common letters as possible.

Available: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,N,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Common letters: L, H, N, P, U, B, etc.

How about ""BLUEY""? Not valid? ""BLEAK"" -> A excluded? Invalid.

""PLUME"": P,L,U,M,E -> M excluded? From ""medic"": M(x)? M is excluded? Invalid.

""FUNKY"": F,U,N,K,Y -> all new? And not excluded? F,U,N,K,Y are not excluded. Second letter E needed? ""FUNKY"" is F, U, N, K, Y? Position 2 is U? but we need position 2 to be E? So not this word? Because we want E at position 2? So we cannot just have any word? Must have E at position 2.

Correct form is X E Y Z W.

""FUNKY"" doesn't have E.

What about:
- ""QUEEN"": Q,U,E,E,N -> good? Positions: Q(1), U(2)? U at position 2? We need E at position 2? But ""queen"" has E at position 3 and 4? Not position 2? So wrong pattern? We require the second letter to be E? But ""queen"" has second letter U? So it would be: positions:1:Q,2:U,3:E,4:E,5:N? Then feedback for E? We know secret has E at position 2? So if we guess ""queen"", position 2 U: if U is not in word? x? And E would be marked at position 3 and 4: if at position 3? But secret has E only at position 2? Then position 3 E might be x? Then position 2 U gets x? But we know position 2 is E? So that guess wastes position 2? We might still get U? Or not? The feedback for position 2 U will be ""x"" because the secret has E at position 2? Not U? So position 2: U is not E and U is not in the word? It would get x? Then positions 3 and 4, E would be at? But we know E is only at position 2? But secret might have more E's? If secret has E at position 3 as well? That's possible? But currently we only know position 2 E? So we don't know about others? Therefore, guessing a word without E at position 2 could be useful if we also include E elsewhere? To test for multiple E's? But it may not be efficient with only 6 tries? It's risky? Also, in this case, we would get position 2 U: if we guess ""queen"", feedback might be: position 1 Q? Then U? which will be x because position 2 must be E? Then E at position 3 or 4, if secret has E at position 3, it would be marked as - or ✓? But we don't know if secret has E elsewhere? So we can test? But we have E at position 2 confirmed? And we don't know about other positions? So perhaps we can use other guesses? But since we have 4 tries left? Maybe we stick to having E at position 2? So we can focus on the first, third, fourth, fifth letters? And not test E again? Or only if convenient? But let's focus on the available letters.

A good word: ""PENAL"": P,E,N,A,L -> but A excluded? From the first feedback? A(x) -> invalid.

""NEXUS"": N,E,X,U,S -> S excluded? Invalid.

""BELCH"": B,E,L,C,H -> C excluded? Invalid.

How about ""YEH"" -> not 5 letters.

""WEEDY"": W,E,E,D,Y -> D excluded? D(x) -> invalid.

""VERGE"": V,E,R,G,E -> R excluded? Invalid.

This is difficult.

Let's think of words with common available letters: U, L, N, H, etc.

""EU K something"" but second letter E: so words like:
- ""LEGER"": L,E,G,E,R -> R excluded? Invalid.
- ""HEDGE"": H,E,D,G,E -> D excluded? Invalid.
- ""LEVEL"" we thought earlier? But let's try something without excluded letters.

Available: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,N,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

For example:
- ""FILE"" -> not 5 letters.
- ""FILEK"" -> ""fickle"" -> but ""fickle"" has I? I excluded? Invalid.

""JUKE"": not 5.

""BEGUN"": B,E,G,U,N -> letters: B,G,U,N -> all available? And structure: B(1),E(2),G(3),U(4),N(5) -> so ""begun"" is a word? Yes. B E G U N.

Letters: B,G,U,N are all new and available.

This is good? We haven't used any of these before? And not excluded.

So we can guess ""begun""? And check.

""Begun"" meets all criteria? Position and letters are from available set.

Another candidate: ""HELIX"": H,E,L,I,X -> I excluded? I got x? Invalid.

""VENUE"": V,E,N,U,E -> E at position 2 and 5? And U? Let's see: letters: V,N,U,E -> E is already known? And U? But ""venue"" structure: V(1),E(2),N(3),U(4),E(5). So we are testing V, N, U? And E at position 5? Which is new? But V,N,U are available? And E is known? So valid? But we are using E twice? That might be OK? But it could reveal if there's more than one E? However, we don't have a better choice? Alternatively, ""begun"" avoids doubling E.

Also, ""begun"" tests B,G,U,N? And not E repetition? Better? Since letters are different.

Similarly, ""P G U N something"" -> ""begun"" is one.

""JEG U something"" not common.

""VEGUN"" not a word.

So ""begun"" seems valid: B E G U N.

Alternatively, ""BEVAN"" is not common? ""Bevel"" -> B,E,V,E,L -> has E twice? And L? Available? But E at position 4? And V? Also good.

But ""begun"" covers G and U? Also new.

Another option: ""LEVIN"": L,E,V,I,N -> I excluded? Invalid.

""KELPY"": K,E,L,P,Y -> K,L,P,Y available? Yes? And E at position 2? So ""K E L P Y"" -> positions.

Both ""begun"" and ""kelpy"" are possible? Let's see: ""kelpy"" is a word? Yes, meaning a brown algal.

Which is better? ""begun"" has B,G,U,N? ""kelpy"" has K,L,P,Y? What letters are more common? In English, L is common, P is common, K, Y? U is common vowel? But U is less common than L? L is very common? Perhaps ""kelpy"" covers common letters? U is also common.

But to decide? We have to pick one.

In ""kelpy"" we have Y at the end? Which is also worth testing? But we don't know.

Also, ""begun"" has more vowels? U in position 4? But in the secret word, we know the second letter is E? And we don't know if there are other vowels? U could be there? But consonants? Both options have two vowels? E and U in ""begun""? In ""kelpy"" has E and Y? With Y acting as vowel.

But ""begun"" uses U which is a vowel? And we don't have U tested? So good.

But whichever, both are valid? I choose ""begun"" for simplicity? Since it doesn't repeat E.

So guess: ""begun""

<guess>begun</guess>Based on the feedback:
- Guess 1 (""roast"") eliminated R, O, A, S, T.
- Guess 2 (""medic"") shows E as correct in position 2 and eliminates M, D, I, C.
- Excluded letters: R, O, A, S, T, M, D, I, C.
- Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- Secret word format: _ E _ _ _.

To maximize information from new letters, the next guess uses B, G, U, and N (common letters from the available pool) while fixing E in position 2. ""Begun"" is a valid 5-letter word that fits this structure and tests new vowels and consonants. It avoids reused or excluded letters.",Guess 3: begun -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(✓) G(x) U(x) N(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,level,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has three vowels and two common consonants. I'll go with ""ROAST"".

 R, O, A, S, T are all common letters. This might give us good information.

 So, my first guess is ""ROAST"".

<guess>roast</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: roast -> FEEDBACK: R(x) O(x) A(x) S(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for our first guess ""roast"": R(x) O(x) A(x) S(x) T(x)
 This means that none of the letters R, O, A, S, T are in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, we must avoid using any of these letters in our next guess.

 Considering that, we need to choose a word that uses different letters. We should pick common letters that haven't been tried.

 The remaining vowels are E, I, U (since A and O are out). Consonants: we have many left like B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Since we have no correct letters, we want to maximize new information. So we should include more common vowels and consonants.

 Common letters in English: E, I, L, N, U, etc. We can also consider words with repeated letters? But typically for second guess we avoid repeats since we have 5-letter unique words? Actually, Wordle allows repeated letters but in this case, since we haven't seen any, maybe we avoid for now.

 A good candidate might be ""CLINE"". However, C and L are common. Alternatively, ""DEUCE"" has two E's and U. But it has E twice? Maybe let's pick a word without repeats.

 Another idea: ""PLUCK"" uses P, L, U, C, K. But U is a vowel? Or we can choose ""NYMPH"" but it has Y (which can be vowel) and is not very common.

 Important: We need to cover as many common letters as possible.

 Common letters remaining: E (most common), then I, L, N, U, D, M, H, C, etc.

 I propose a word that uses E and I (vowels) and three common consonants: L, N, D, H, C, etc.

 Example: ""LINED"" -> L, I, N, E, D. This gives us two vowels (I, E) and three consonants (L, N, D).

 But note: we have already eliminated R,O,A,S,T so we must avoid them.

 Alternatively, ""CHIME"": C, H, I, M, E. This covers E, C, H, I, M.

 Another one: ""LEECH"" but it has repeated E? And H at end. Better to avoid repeats? Yes, because we don't know if there is repetition.

 Let me choose ""CHIME"". It has C, H, I, M, E. All new letters and covers common vowels and consonants.

 But note: there might be a word that covers more frequent letters? E, I are high frequency.

 Alternatively, ""QUERY"" but Q is rare and we have eliminated R? R is already eliminated so we must not use R.

 Another candidate: ""FILCH"" has F, I, L, C, H. F is less common? Maybe skip.

 How about ""MEDIC""? M, E, D, I, C. That's M, E, D, I, C. Also good because it covers E and I.

 Let me choose ""MEDIC"". It uses M, E, D, I, C.

 However, note that ""CHIME"" is also good. I'll go with ""MEDIC"" because D and C are very common.

 Wait, another idea: ""PINEY"", but Y is sometimes vowel and we haven't tested Y? But we are avoiding R,O,A,S,T so P,I,N,E,Y. But Y is the last letter and might be less common? Actually, Y is common in words as a vowel.

 But let me stick to ""MEDIC"".

 Alternatively, ""ELUDE""? E, L, U, D, E. Wait, repeated E? Not allowed? The rules don't say repeated letters are disallowed, but in the guess we can have repeated letters? However, the word must be valid. But for efficiency, we might want to avoid repeats to cover more letters.

 Since we didn't get any positive feedback, we want to test as many new letters as possible. Therefore, we should avoid repeating letters in this guess?

 Absolutely. So ""ELUDE"" has two E's so it's not ideal. Similarly, ""LEECH"" is no.

 So ""MEDIC"" is unique letters: M, E, D, I, C.

 Therefore, I choose ""MEDIC"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""roast"" – where none of the letters (R, O, A, S, T) are in the secret word – we need to avoid those letters entirely in our next guess. 

To maximize information, we should test new common vowels and consonants. The word ""**medic**"" incorporates:
- **M, E, D, I, C**: These are high-frequency letters (avoiding the eliminated ones)  
- Covers 2 new vowels (E, I) and 3 new consonants (M, D, C)  
- Helps quickly check if any of these dominant letters appear in the secret word  

This strategic guess narrows possibilities while adhering to the feedback.

<guess>medic</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: roast -> FEEDBACK: R(x) O(x) A(x) S(x) T(x)
Guess 2: medic -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(✓) D(x) I(x) C(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two guesses and their feedback:
1. ""roast"" -> all letters incorrect: R, O, A, S, T are not in the word at all.
2. ""medic"" -> M(x), E(✓), D(x), I(x), C(x). 
   - This means that only E is in the word and it's in the correct position. Specifically, E is the second letter because in ""medic"":
        Position 1: M -> x
        Position 2: E -> ✓ -> so the secret word has E as the second letter.
   - The other letters M, D, I, C are not in the word at all.

Therefore, we know:
- The second letter is E.
- Letters that are definitely not in the word: R, O, A, S, T, M, D, I, C.

Available letters: We can use any letters except those excluded: R,O,A,S,T,M,D,I,C.

We need to form a 5-letter word where:
- The second letter is E.
- The word must not contain any of the excluded letters.

Common letters left: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. And we have vowels: U and Y (since A, E, I, O are used; note E is placed but cannot use I or O or A). But wait E is placed so we have E in the word, but we can use other vowels? Actually, we have to use new letters that aren't excluded.

Vowels available: U (and sometimes Y, W act as vowels). We can use U and Y.

Structure: The word is: ? E ? ? ?

We need to choose a word that uses only remaining letters: 
Available: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to cover common letters to gather more information. Common consonants: H, L, N, P, etc.

Possible guesses:

Let's list some words that fit:
- HAVE: H, A, V, E -> but A is excluded (from first guess). Invalid.
- HAVE is no because A is excluded.

We need words without A, and without the other excluded letters.

Examples:
- JEWEL: J, E, W, E, L -> but second letter is E? Actually: J(1), E(2), W(3), E(4), L(5). So position 2 is E. But note it has E twice. Also, letters: J, W, E, L. E is already known, so we are testing J, W, L. However, E appears again? But we don't know if E repeats. We are allowed to guess repeated letters? The rules don't forbid it, but since E is already known to be in position 2, it might be redundant? Not necessarily, if E appears twice we can get a - or ✓ for the second E? However, currently we only know one E. But if we guess a word with two E's, we can test if there is a second E.

But we need to avoid excluded letters. Checking: J is available, E is allowed (but we know it's in position 2, so position 4 if we put E would be another test), W, L.

But note: E in position 4: if the secret word does not have E in position 4, but has E elsewhere, we might get a - sign? Actually, the feedback would say - if it's somewhere else? But we already have E in position 2 correct. However, we are testing for other letters too.

But let's avoid repeats for now? Because we want to maximize the number of new letters? Since we don't know, maybe keep it simple.

Another word: ""LEECH"" -> L, E, E, C, H -> but C is excluded? C was in the excluded list from guess 2.

No, C is excluded (from ""medic"": C(x)).

So let's avoid using E again if possible? To test more letters.

Options:
- ""FEIGN"" -> F, E, I, G, N -> I is excluded? From guess 2: I(x). So I is excluded? Yes, because I got x.

Excluded letters: R, O, A, S, T, M, D, I, C.

So in ""FEIGN"": I is excluded -> invalid.

- ""NEVER"" -> N, E, V, E, R -> but R is excluded? R was in first guess with x -> invalid.

- ""HELP"" -> H, E, L, P -> only 4 letters? Must be 5 letters.

We need 5-letter words.

Perhaps:
- ""BEVEL"": B, E, V, E, L -> uses E twice? But B, V, L are new.
But E appears at position 2 and position 5? Positions: B(1), E(2), V(3), E(4), L(5). Actually, position 4 would be E? But we are going to have position 2 E known, so we are testing B, V, L at positions 1,3,5 and also testing if position 4 is E? That might be inefficient because if we don't get a second E, it doesn't help as much? But we can try.

However, we are allowed to do so.

Another word: ""FJELD"" -> F, J, E, L, D -> D is excluded? From guess 2, D(x) -> invalid.

Let's find words that only use available letters: B, F, G, H, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z and the vowel U or Y? And not using E again? But E is in a known position so we can skip other E? Or we can use E? Actually, we might want to test for repetition? Since we don't know.

Alternatively, avoid E repetition for more coverage? We have few guesses left.

Another candidate: ""BLEWY"" -> not valid? Let's list:

""BEVY"" is not 5 letters.

Actually: 
- ""LEVEL"" -> L,E,V,E,L -> but L repeated? And position 2 is E -> good? But V is included. However: letters: L, E, V -> but V, L are new? And we test if E is at position 4? And L at beginning and end? But it has two L's and two E's? Also, L and E are being tested? However, we don't know if L is in the word? Actually, the secret word might have L? We haven't tested.

But the excluded letters: we cannot use R,O,A,S,T,M,D,I,C -> LEVEL uses L, E, V -> L and V are allowed.

But: positions:
Position 1: L -> new
Position 2: E -> ✓ (we know)
Position 3: V -> new
Position 4: E -> we don't know? This would test position 4.
Position 5: L -> same as position 1? So if L is in the word? But wait, testing two positions for L? Might be useful.

But the word ""level"" is valid? Well, LEVEL is a word.

Alternatively, let me try ""BLEEP"" -> B, L, E, E, P -> valid? But P is allowed? And E at 3rd and 4th? Actually position 2: we are expecting E -> so we need to have E at position 2? No: the structure we need is any second letter E.

For ""BLEEP"": positions are B(1), L(2), E(3), E(4), P(5) -> but position 2 is L? It must be E? So that guess would be invalid? Because we don't have E in the second position? For our guess, we must have E in the second position? Because we know that the secret word has E as the second letter? So in our guess, we must put E in the second position? Otherwise, we might get a - or x for E? But the feedback for E would be - if it's in another position? But we want to use the known E to keep position 2 correct? Actually, we can change? But it's not necessary? Because if we put E elsewhere and get ✓, we would know? But we only know position 2 has E? So we can try putting E at another position? However, to maximize efficiency, we can perhaps keep position 2 as E? That way we have 4 other positions? Or we can move E to test? But since we don't know if there is another E, we can try.

But it might be better to have position 2 fixed as E to lock that position? Then test other letters? Then we know always one letter is E and in place? So we can focus on the rest.

Given that, let's fix position 2 as E and choose other letters from the available pool.

So guess: [first] E [third] [fourth] [fifth]

Letters: first, third, fourth, fifth must be from {B, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z} excluding already excluded? As above, as long as not in excluded letters.

Common combinations: 
- Words like ""BELOW"" -> but O is excluded? O is excluded? From first guess: O(x) -> invalid.
- ""BEING"" -> I excluded? From guess 2 -> invalid.
- ""HONEY"" -> O excluded? Invalid.
- ""KEYED"" -> E at fourth? Also D excluded -> invalid.

Try ""LENES"" -> L,E,N,E,S -> S excluded? From first guess? S(x) -> invalid.

Another: ""BELLE"" -> B, E, L, L, E -> repeated E and L? And second letter E? Positions: B(1), E(2), L(3), L(4), E(5). Uses B, L, E -> L is new? So we test B and L? But two L's.

Better words?
How about ""UVEA"" -> too short.

Perhaps: ""QUEUE"" -> Q, U, E, U, E -> second position E? No, position 1:Q,2:U, etc -> not E in second?

Need word: _ E _ _ _

Options:
- ""FEIGN"" -> not allowed because I excluded? Yes.
- ""NEIGH"" -> N, E, I, G, H -> I excluded? Invalid.

Without I: 
- ""LEGAL"" -> L,E,G,A -> but A excluded? Invalid.

Available vowels: U and Y.

So words with U or Y in them? Or all consonants?

Example: ""DEUCE"" -> D excluded? Invalid.
- ""YEUKY"" -> not valid word.

""YEXES"" -> but X and S? S excluded.

Common word: ""HONEY"" -> O excluded? No, O is excluded.

Another: ""FLUKE"" -> F, L, U, K, E -> but E at fifth? We have E at position 2 -> so we need E at position 2? But FLUKE has E at position 5? So to avoid having E at all? Or have at position 2? If we use FLUKE, position 2 is L, which we don't know? Then feedback: position 5 E might be ✓ or x? But we know E is in the word? So if we put E at position 5, it might get ✓ if it is indeed there? But we also have position 2? We don't know position 2? We do know position 2 is E? So it's better to use a word that has E at position 2? To keep that spot? Otherwise, we lose a chance? Or get more info?

Let me clarify: the secret word has E in position 2? So if we guess a word without E at position 2, then E (if at position 5) might get marked with - or ✓? If at position 5, ✓ would mean the secret has E at position 5? But we already know E at position 2? So the word could have two E's? Or if we don't have E at position 2, then we'd get feedback that position 2 is not E? But it is E in the secret? So that would be wasteful? Because we already know it's E? So we always want E at position 2? To lock that? Then we don't have to retest? And we focus on the other letters? Yes.

Therefore, we stick with having E in position 2? So the guess must have the second letter E? Then we can concentrate on discovering the other letters? So all guesses going forward should have E in position 2? Until we know more? Or we have the full word.

So: guess pattern: [letter] E [letter] [letter] [letter]

We need to pick word of the form X E Y Z W.

Available letters: all except excluded: R,O,A,S,T,M,D,I,C.

So available: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,N,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

We also have to avoid using excluded letters? And we want to cover common letters to narrow down.

Let me list possible words:
- ""BELOW"": includes O -> excluded? O is excluded -> no.
- ""BENCH"": C excluded? C from ""medic"" got x -> excluded? So invalid.
- ""FENCE"": E? But in addition to position 2? And C excluded? Invalid.
- ""JELLY"": J,E,L,L,Y -> Y at the end? And L repeated. But letters: J,L,Y -> new? So valid? Word.

JELLY: J,E,L,L,Y -> positions: J(1),E(2),(L at 3 and 4), Y(5). But it has two L's? We can do that? The word is acceptable? But we risk that L might be in the word once? But if it isn't, we duplicate? Or we can get feedback.

Another: ""LEVEL"" -> L,E,V,E,L -> but E at 4? Will be tested? And V? Levels? Valid? But E is at 2 and 4? Which we already know for position 2? So we can test if E is at position 4? And V and L? But we have two L's? Might be inefficient? Especially since we have limited guesses.

Better to pick a word with entirely new letters? Covering as many new common letters as possible.

Available: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,N,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Common letters: L, H, N, P, U, B, etc.

How about ""BLUEY""? Not valid? ""BLEAK"" -> A excluded? Invalid.

""PLUME"": P,L,U,M,E -> M excluded? From ""medic"": M(x)? M is excluded? Invalid.

""FUNKY"": F,U,N,K,Y -> all new? And not excluded? F,U,N,K,Y are not excluded. Second letter E needed? ""FUNKY"" is F, U, N, K, Y? Position 2 is U? but we need position 2 to be E? So not this word? Because we want E at position 2? So we cannot just have any word? Must have E at position 2.

Correct form is X E Y Z W.

""FUNKY"" doesn't have E.

What about:
- ""QUEEN"": Q,U,E,E,N -> good? Positions: Q(1), U(2)? U at position 2? We need E at position 2? But ""queen"" has E at position 3 and 4? Not position 2? So wrong pattern? We require the second letter to be E? But ""queen"" has second letter U? So it would be: positions:1:Q,2:U,3:E,4:E,5:N? Then feedback for E? We know secret has E at position 2? So if we guess ""queen"", position 2 U: if U is not in word? x? And E would be marked at position 3 and 4: if at position 3? But secret has E only at position 2? Then position 3 E might be x? Then position 2 U gets x? But we know position 2 is E? So that guess wastes position 2? We might still get U? Or not? The feedback for position 2 U will be ""x"" because the secret has E at position 2? Not U? So position 2: U is not E and U is not in the word? It would get x? Then positions 3 and 4, E would be at? But we know E is only at position 2? But secret might have more E's? If secret has E at position 3 as well? That's possible? But currently we only know position 2 E? So we don't know about others? Therefore, guessing a word without E at position 2 could be useful if we also include E elsewhere? To test for multiple E's? But it may not be efficient with only 6 tries? It's risky? Also, in this case, we would get position 2 U: if we guess ""queen"", feedback might be: position 1 Q? Then U? which will be x because position 2 must be E? Then E at position 3 or 4, if secret has E at position 3, it would be marked as - or ✓? But we don't know if secret has E elsewhere? So we can test? But we have E at position 2 confirmed? And we don't know about other positions? So perhaps we can use other guesses? But since we have 4 tries left? Maybe we stick to having E at position 2? So we can focus on the first, third, fourth, fifth letters? And not test E again? Or only if convenient? But let's focus on the available letters.

A good word: ""PENAL"": P,E,N,A,L -> but A excluded? From the first feedback? A(x) -> invalid.

""NEXUS"": N,E,X,U,S -> S excluded? Invalid.

""BELCH"": B,E,L,C,H -> C excluded? Invalid.

How about ""YEH"" -> not 5 letters.

""WEEDY"": W,E,E,D,Y -> D excluded? D(x) -> invalid.

""VERGE"": V,E,R,G,E -> R excluded? Invalid.

This is difficult.

Let's think of words with common available letters: U, L, N, H, etc.

""EU K something"" but second letter E: so words like:
- ""LEGER"": L,E,G,E,R -> R excluded? Invalid.
- ""HEDGE"": H,E,D,G,E -> D excluded? Invalid.
- ""LEVEL"" we thought earlier? But let's try something without excluded letters.

Available: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,N,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

For example:
- ""FILE"" -> not 5 letters.
- ""FILEK"" -> ""fickle"" -> but ""fickle"" has I? I excluded? Invalid.

""JUKE"": not 5.

""BEGUN"": B,E,G,U,N -> letters: B,G,U,N -> all available? And structure: B(1),E(2),G(3),U(4),N(5) -> so ""begun"" is a word? Yes. B E G U N.

Letters: B,G,U,N are all new and available.

This is good? We haven't used any of these before? And not excluded.

So we can guess ""begun""? And check.

""Begun"" meets all criteria? Position and letters are from available set.

Another candidate: ""HELIX"": H,E,L,I,X -> I excluded? I got x? Invalid.

""VENUE"": V,E,N,U,E -> E at position 2 and 5? And U? Let's see: letters: V,N,U,E -> E is already known? And U? But ""venue"" structure: V(1),E(2),N(3),U(4),E(5). So we are testing V, N, U? And E at position 5? Which is new? But V,N,U are available? And E is known? So valid? But we are using E twice? That might be OK? But it could reveal if there's more than one E? However, we don't have a better choice? Alternatively, ""begun"" avoids doubling E.

Also, ""begun"" tests B,G,U,N? And not E repetition? Better? Since letters are different.

Similarly, ""P G U N something"" -> ""begun"" is one.

""JEG U something"" not common.

""VEGUN"" not a word.

So ""begun"" seems valid: B E G U N.

Alternatively, ""BEVAN"" is not common? ""Bevel"" -> B,E,V,E,L -> has E twice? And L? Available? But E at position 4? And V? Also good.

But ""begun"" covers G and U? Also new.

Another option: ""LEVIN"": L,E,V,I,N -> I excluded? Invalid.

""KELPY"": K,E,L,P,Y -> K,L,P,Y available? Yes? And E at position 2? So ""K E L P Y"" -> positions.

Both ""begun"" and ""kelpy"" are possible? Let's see: ""kelpy"" is a word? Yes, meaning a brown algal.

Which is better? ""begun"" has B,G,U,N? ""kelpy"" has K,L,P,Y? What letters are more common? In English, L is common, P is common, K, Y? U is common vowel? But U is less common than L? L is very common? Perhaps ""kelpy"" covers common letters? U is also common.

But to decide? We have to pick one.

In ""kelpy"" we have Y at the end? Which is also worth testing? But we don't know.

Also, ""begun"" has more vowels? U in position 4? But in the secret word, we know the second letter is E? And we don't know if there are other vowels? U could be there? But consonants? Both options have two vowels? E and U in ""begun""? In ""kelpy"" has E and Y? With Y acting as vowel.

But ""begun"" uses U which is a vowel? And we don't have U tested? So good.

But whichever, both are valid? I choose ""begun"" for simplicity? Since it doesn't repeat E.

So guess: ""begun""

<guess>begun</guess>Based on the feedback:
- Guess 1 (""roast"") eliminated R, O, A, S, T.
- Guess 2 (""medic"") shows E as correct in position 2 and eliminates M, D, I, C.
- Excluded letters: R, O, A, S, T, M, D, I, C.
- Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- Secret word format: _ E _ _ _.

To maximize information from new letters, the next guess uses B, G, U, and N (common letters from the available pool) while fixing E in position 2. ""Begun"" is a valid 5-letter word that fits this structure and tests new vowels and consonants. It avoids reused or excluded letters.

We should pick common letters that haven\'t been tried.\n\n The remaining vowels are E, I, U (since A and O are out). Consonants: we have many left like B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n Since we have no correct letters, we want to maximize new information. So we should include more common vowels and consonants.\n\n Common letters in English: E, I, L, N, U, etc. We can also consider words with repeated letters? But typically for second guess we avoid repeats since we have 5-letter unique words? Actually, Wordle allows repeated letters but in this case, since we haven\'t seen any, maybe we avoid for now.\n\n A good candidate might be ""CLINE"". However, C and L are common. Alternatively, ""DEUCE"" has two E\'s and U. But it has E twice? Maybe let\'s pick a word without repeats.\n\n Another idea: ""PLUCK"" uses P, L, U, C, K. But U is a vowel? Or we can choose ""NYMPH"" but it has Y (which can be vowel) and is not very common.\n\n Important: We need to cover as many common letters as possible.\n\n Common letters remaining: E (most common), then I, L, N, U, D, M, H, C, etc.\n\n I propose a word that uses E and I (vowels) and three common consonants: L, N, D, H, C, etc.\n\n Example: ""LINED"" -> L, I, N, E, D. This gives us two vowels (I, E) and three consonants (L, N, D).\n\n But note: we have already eliminated R,O,A,S,T so we must avoid them.\n\n Alternatively, ""CHIME"": C, H, I, M, E. This covers E, C, H, I, M.\n\n Another one: ""LEECH"" but it has repeated E? And H at end. Better to avoid repeats? Yes, because we don\'t know if there is repetition.\n\n Let me choose ""CHIME"". It has C, H, I, M, E. All new letters and covers common vowels and consonants.\n\n But note: there might be a word that covers more frequent letters? E, I are high frequency.\n\n Alternatively, ""QUERY"" but Q is rare and we have eliminated R? R is already eliminated so we must not use R.\n\n Another candidate: ""FILCH"" has F, I, L, C, H. F is less common? Maybe skip.\n\n How about ""MEDIC""? M, E, D, I, C. That\'s M, E, D, I, C. Also good because it covers E and I.\n\n Let me choose ""MEDIC"". It uses M, E, D, I, C.\n\n However, note that ""CHIME"" is also good. I\'ll go with ""MEDIC"" because D and C are very common.\n\n Wait, another idea: ""PINEY"", but Y is sometimes vowel and we haven\'t tested Y? But we are avoiding R,O,A,S,T so P,I,N,E,Y. But Y is the last letter and might be less common? Actually, Y is common in words as a vowel.\n\n But let me stick to ""MEDIC"".\n\n Alternatively, ""ELUDE""? E, L, U, D, E. Wait, repeated E? Not allowed? The rules don\'t say repeated letters are disallowed, but in the guess we can have repeated letters? However, the word must be valid. But for efficiency, we might want to avoid repeats to cover more letters.\n\n Since we didn\'t get any positive feedback, we want to test as many new letters as possible. Therefore, we should avoid repeating letters in this guess?\n\n Absolutely. So ""ELUDE"" has two E\'s so it\'s not ideal. Similarly, ""LEECH"" is no.\n\n So ""MEDIC"" is unique letters: M, E, D, I, C.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""MEDIC"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""roast"" – where none of the letters (R, O, A, S, T) are in the secret word – we need to avoid those letters entirely in our next guess. \n\nTo maximize information, we should test new common vowels and consonants. The word ""**medic**"" incorporates:\n- **M, E, D, I, C**: These are high-frequency letters (avoiding the eliminated ones)  \n- Covers 2 new vowels (E, I) and 3 new consonants (M, D, C)  \n- Helps quickly check if any of these dominant letters appear in the secret word  \n\nThis strategic guess narrows possibilities while adhering to the feedback.\n\n<guess>medic</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: roast -> FEEDBACK: R(x) O(x) A(x) S(x) T(x)\nGuess 2: medic -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(✓) D(x) I(x) C(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two guesses and their feedback:\n1.

Invalid.\n- HAVE is no because A is excluded.\n\nWe need words without A, and without the other excluded letters.\n\nExamples:\n- JEWEL: J, E, W, E, L -> but second letter is E? Actually: J(1), E(2), W(3), E(4), L(5). So position 2 is E. But note it has E twice. Also, letters: J, W, E, L. E is already known, so we are testing J, W, L. However, E appears again? But we don\'t know if E repeats. We are allowed to guess repeated letters? The rules don\'t forbid it, but since E is already known to be in position 2, it might be redundant? Not necessarily, if E appears twice we can get a - or ✓ for the second E? However, currently we only know one E. But if we guess a word with two E\'s, we can test if there is a second E.\n\nBut we need to avoid excluded letters. Checking: J is available, E is allowed (but we know it\'s in position 2, so position 4 if we put E would be another test), W, L.\n\nBut note: E in position 4: if the secret word does not have E in position 4, but has E elsewhere, we might get a - sign? Actually, the feedback would say - if it\'s somewhere else? But we already have E in position 2 correct. However, we are testing for other letters too.\n\nBut let\'s avoid repeats for now? Because we want to maximize the number of new letters? Since we don\'t know, maybe keep it simple.\n\nAnother word: ""LEECH"" -> L, E, E, C, H -> but C is excluded? C was in the excluded list from guess 2.\n\nNo, C is excluded (from ""medic"": C(x)).\n\nSo let\'s avoid using E again if possible? To test more letters.\n\nOptions:\n- ""FEIGN"" -> F, E, I, G, N -> I is excluded? From guess 2: I(x). So I is excluded? Yes, because I got x.\n\nExcluded letters: R, O, A, S, T, M, D, I, C.\n\nSo in ""FEIGN"": I is excluded -> invalid.\n\n- ""NEVER"" -> N, E, V, E, R -> but R is excluded? R was in first guess with x -> invalid.\n\n- ""HELP"" -> H, E, L, P -> only 4 letters? Must be 5 letters.\n\nWe need 5-letter words.\n\nPerhaps:\n- ""BEVEL"": B, E, V, E, L -> uses E twice? But B, V, L are new.\nBut E appears at position 2 and position 5? Positions: B(1), E(2), V(3), E(4), L(5). Actually, position 4 would be E? But we are going to have position 2 E known, so we are testing B, V, L at positions 1,3,5 and also testing if position 4 is E? That might be inefficient because if we don\'t get a second E, it doesn\'t help as much? But we can try.\n\nHowever, we are allowed to do so.\n\nAnother word: ""FJELD"" -> F, J, E, L, D -> D is excluded? From guess 2, D(x) -> invalid.\n\nLet\'s find words that only use available letters: B, F, G, H, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z and the vowel U or Y? And not using E again? But E is in a known position so we can skip other E? Or we can use E? Actually, we might want to test for repetition? Since we don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, avoid E repetition for more coverage? We have few guesses left.\n\nAnother candidate: ""BLEWY"" -> not valid? Let\'s list:\n\n""BEVY"" is not 5 letters.\n\nActually: \n- ""LEVEL"" -> L,E,V,E,L -> but L repeated? And position 2 is E -> good? But V is included. However: letters: L, E, V -> but V, L are new? And we test if E is at position 4? And L at beginning and end? But it has two L\'s and two E\'s? Also, L and E are being tested? However, we don\'t know if L is in the word? Actually, the secret word might have L? We haven\'t tested.\n\nBut the excluded letters: we cannot use R,O,A,S,T,M,D,I,C -> LEVEL uses L, E, V -> L and V are allowed.\n\nBut: positions:\nPosition 1: L -> new\nPosition 2: E -> ✓ (we know)\nPosition 3: V -> new\nPosition 4: E -> we don\'t know? This would test position 4.\nPosition 5: L -> same as position 1? So if L is in the word? But wait, testing two positions for L? Might be useful.\n\nBut the word ""level"" is valid? Well, LEVEL is a word.\n\nAlternatively, let me try ""BLEEP"" -> B, L, E, E, P -> valid? But P is allowed? And E at 3rd and 4th? Actually position 2: we are expecting E -> so we need to have E at position 2? No: the structure we need is any second letter E.\n\nFor ""BLEEP"": positions are B(1), L(2), E(3), E(4), P(5) -> but position 2 is L? It must be E? So that guess would be invalid? Because we don\'t have E in the second position? For our guess, we must have E in the second position? Because we know that the secret word has E as the second letter? So in our guess, we must put E in the second position? Otherwise, we might get a - or x for E? But the feedback for E would be - if it\'s in another position? But we want to use the known E to keep position 2 correct? Actually, we can change? But it\'s not necessary? Because if we put E elsewhere and get ✓, we would know? But we only know position 2 has E? So we can try putting E at another position? However, to maximize efficiency, we can perhaps keep position 2 as E? That way we have 4 other positions? Or we can move E to test? But since we don\'t know if there is another E, we can try.\n\nBut it might be better to have position 2 fixed as E to lock that position? Then test other letters? Then we know always one letter is E and in place? So we can focus on the rest.\n\nGiven that, let\'s fix position 2 as E and choose other letters from the available pool.\n\nSo guess: [first] E [third] [fourth] [fifth]\n\nLetters: first, third, fourth, fifth must be from {B, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z} excluding already excluded? As above, as long as not in excluded letters.\n\nCommon combinations: \n- Words like ""BELOW"" -> but O is excluded? O is excluded? From first guess: O(x) -> invalid.\n- ""BEING"" -> I excluded? From guess 2 -> invalid.\n- ""HONEY"" -> O excluded? Invalid.\n- ""KEYED"" -> E at fourth? Also D excluded -> invalid.\n\nTry ""LENES"" -> L,E,N,E,S -> S excluded? From first guess? S(x) -> invalid.\n\nAnother: ""BELLE"" -> B, E, L, L, E -> repeated E and L? And second letter E? Positions: B(1), E(2), L(3), L(4), E(5). Uses B, L, E -> L is new? So we test B and L? But two L\'s.\n\nBetter words?\nHow about ""UVEA"" -> too short.\n\nPerhaps: ""QUEUE"" -> Q, U, E, U, E -> second position E? No, position 1:Q,2:U, etc -> not E in second?\n\nNeed word: _ E _ _ _\n\nOptions:\n- ""FEIGN"" -> not allowed because I excluded? Yes.\n- ""NEIGH"" -> N, E, I, G, H -> I excluded? Invalid.\n\nWithout I: \n- ""LEGAL"" -> L,E,G,A -> but A excluded? Invalid.\n\nAvailable vowels: U and Y.\n\nSo words with U or Y in them? Or all consonants?\n\nExample: ""DEUCE"" -> D excluded? Invalid.\n- ""YEUKY"" -> not valid word.\n\n""YEXES"" -> but X and S? S excluded.\n\nCommon word: ""HONEY"" -> O excluded? No, O is excluded.\n\nAnother: ""FLUKE"" -> F, L, U, K, E -> but E at fifth? We have E at position 2 -> so we need E at position 2? But FLUKE has E at position 5? So to avoid having E at all? Or have at position 2? If we use FLUKE, position 2 is L, which we don\'t know? Then feedback: position 5 E might be ✓ or x? But we know E is in the word? So if we put E at position 5, it might get ✓ if it is indeed there? But we also have position 2? We don\'t know position 2? We do know position 2 is E? So it\'s better to use a word that has E at position 2? To keep that spot? Otherwise, we lose a chance? Or get more info?\n\nLet me clarify: the secret word has E in position 2? So if we guess a word without E at position 2, then E (if at position 5) might get marked with - or ✓? If at position 5, ✓ would mean the secret has E at position 5? But we already know E at position 2? So the word could have two E\'s? Or if we don\'t have E at position 2, then we\'d get feedback that position 2 is not E? But it is E in the secret? So that would be wasteful? Because we already know it\'s E? So we always want E at position 2? To lock that? Then we don\'t have to retest? And we focus on the other letters? Yes.\n\nTherefore, we stick with having E in position 2? So the guess must have the second letter E? Then we can concentrate on discovering the other letters? So all guesses going forward should have E in position 2? Until we know more? Or we have the full word.\n\nSo: guess pattern: [letter] E [letter] [letter] [letter]\n\nWe need to pick word of the form X E Y Z W.\n\nAvailable letters: all except excluded: R,O,A,S,T,M,D,I,C.\n\nSo available: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,N,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nWe also have to avoid using excluded letters? And we want to cover common letters to narrow down.\n\nLet me list possible words:\n- ""BELOW"": includes O -> excluded? O is excluded -> no.\n- ""BENCH"": C excluded? C from ""medic"" got x -> excluded? So invalid.\n- ""FENCE"": E? But in addition to position 2? And C excluded? Invalid.\n- ""JELLY"": J,E,L,L,Y -> Y at the end? And L repeated. But letters: J,L,Y -> new? So valid? Word.\n\nJELLY: J,E,L,L,Y -> positions: J(1),E(2),(L at 3 and 4), Y(5). But it has two L\'s? We can do that? The word is acceptable? But we risk that L might be in the word once? But if it isn\'t, we duplicate? Or we can get feedback.\n\nAnother: ""LEVEL"" -> L,E,V,E,L -> but E at 4? Will be tested? And V? Levels? Valid? But E is at 2 and 4? Which we already know for position 2? So we can test if E is at position 4? And V and L? But we have two L\'s? Might be inefficient? Especially since we have limited guesses.\n\nBetter to pick a word with entirely new letters? Covering as many new common letters as possible.\n\nAvailable: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,N,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nCommon letters: L, H, N, P, U, B, etc.\n\nHow about ""BLUEY""? Not valid? ""BLEAK"" -> A excluded? Invalid.\n\n""PLUME"": P,L,U,M,E -> M excluded? From ""medic"": M(x)? M is excluded? Invalid.\n\n""FUNKY"": F,U,N,K,Y -> all new? And not excluded? F,U,N,K,Y are not excluded. Second letter E needed? ""FUNKY"" is F, U, N, K, Y? Position 2 is U? but we need position 2 to be E? So not this word? Because we want E at position 2? So we cannot just have any word? Must have E at position 2.\n\nCorrect form is X E Y Z W.\n\n""FUNKY"" doesn\'t have E.\n\nWhat about:\n- ""QUEEN"": Q,U,E,E,N -> good? Positions: Q(1), U(2)? U at position 2? We need E at position 2? But ""queen"" has E at position 3 and 4? Not position 2? So wrong pattern? We require the second letter to be E? But ""queen"" has second letter U? So it would be: positions:1:Q,2:U,3:E,4:E,5:N? Then feedback for E? We know secret has E at position 2? So if we guess ""queen"", position 2 U: if U is not in word? x? And E would be marked at position 3 and 4: if at position 3? But secret has E only at position 2? Then position 3 E might be x? Then position 2 U gets x? But we know position 2 is E? So that guess wastes position 2? We might still get U? Or not? The feedback for position 2 U will be ""x"" because the secret has E at position 2? Not U? So position 2: U is not E and U is not in the word? It would get x? Then positions 3 and 4, E would be at? But we know E is only at position 2? But secret might have more E\'s? If secret has E at position 3 as well? That\'s possible? But currently we only know position 2 E? So we don\'t know about others? Therefore, guessing a word without E at position 2 could be useful if we also include E elsewhere? To test for multiple E\'s? But it may not be efficient with only 6 tries? It\'s risky? Also, in this case, we would get position 2 U: if we guess ""queen"", feedback might be: position 1 Q? Then U? which will be x because position 2 must be E? Then E at position 3 or 4, if secret has E at position 3, it would be marked as - or ✓? But we don\'t know if secret has E elsewhere? So we can test? But we have E at position 2 confirmed? And we don\'t know about other positions? So perhaps we can use other guesses? But since we have 4 tries left? Maybe we stick to having E at position 2? So we can focus on the first, third, fourth, fifth letters? And not test E again? Or only if convenient? But let\'s focus on the available letters.\n\nA good word: ""PENAL"": P,E,N,A,L -> but A excluded? From the first feedback? A(x) -> invalid.\n\n""NEXUS"": N,E,X,U,S -> S excluded? Invalid.\n\n""BELCH"": B,E,L,C,H -> C excluded? Invalid.\n\nHow about ""YEH"" -> not 5 letters.\n\n""WEEDY"": W,E,E,D,Y -> D excluded? D(x) -> invalid.\n\n""VERGE"": V,E,R,G,E -> R excluded? Invalid.\n\nThis is difficult.\n\nLet\'s think of words with common available letters: U, L, N, H, etc.\n\n""EU K something"" but second letter E: so words like:\n- ""LEGER"": L,E,G,E,R -> R excluded? Invalid.\n- ""HEDGE"": H,E,D,G,E -> D excluded? Invalid.\n- ""LEVEL"" we thought earlier? But let\'s try something without excluded letters.\n\nAvailable: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,N,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nFor example:\n- ""FILE"" -> not 5 letters.\n- ""FILEK"" -> ""fickle"" -> but ""fickle"" has I? I excluded? Invalid.\n\n""JUKE"": not 5.\n\n""BEGUN"": B,E,G,U,N -> letters: B,G,U,N -> all available? And structure: B(1),E(2),G(3),U(4),N(5) -> so ""begun"" is a word? Yes. B E G U N.\n\nLetters: B,G,U,N are all new and available.\n\nThis is good? We haven\'t used any of these before? And not excluded.\n\nSo we can guess ""begun""? And check.\n\n""Begun"" meets all criteria? Position and letters are from available set.\n\nAnother candidate: ""HELIX"": H,E,L,I,X -> I excluded? I got x? Invalid.\n\n""VENUE"": V,E,N,U,E -> E at position 2 and 5? And U? Let\'s see: letters: V,N,U,E -> E is already known? And U? But ""venue"" structure: V(1),E(2),N(3),U(4),E(5). So we are testing V, N, U? And E at position 5? Which is new? But V,N,U are available? And E is known? So valid? But we are using E twice? That might be OK? But it could reveal if there\'s more than one E? However, we don\'t have a better choice? Alternatively, ""begun"" avoids doubling E.\n\nAlso, ""begun"" tests B,G,U,N? And not E repetition? Better? Since letters are different.\n\nSimilarly, ""P G U N something"" -> ""begun"" is one.\n\n""JEG U something"" not common.\n\n""VEGUN"" not a word.\n\nSo ""begun"" seems valid: B E G U N.\n\nAlternatively, ""BEVAN"" is not common? ""Bevel"" -> B,E,V,E,L -> has E twice? And L? Available? But E at position 4? And V? Also good.\n\nBut ""begun"" covers G and U? Also new.\n\nAnother option: ""LEVIN"": L,E,V,I,N -> I excluded? Invalid.\n\n""KELPY"": K,E,L,P,Y -> K,L,P,Y available? Yes? And E at position 2? So ""K E L P Y"" -> positions.\n\nBoth ""begun"" and ""kelpy"" are possible? Let\'s see: ""kelpy"" is a word? Yes, meaning a brown algal.\n\nWhich is better? ""begun"" has B,G,U,N? ""kelpy"" has K,L,P,Y? What letters are more common? In English, L is common, P is common, K, Y? U is common vowel? But U is less common than L? L is very common? Perhaps ""kelpy"" covers common letters? U is also common.\n\nBut to decide? We have to pick one.\n\nIn ""kelpy"" we have Y at the end? Which is also worth testing? But we don\'t know.\n\nAlso, ""begun"" has more vowels? U in position 4? But in the secret word, we know the second letter is E? And we don\'t know if there are other vowels? U could be there? But consonants? Both options have two vowels? E and U in ""begun""? In ""kelpy"" has E and Y? With Y acting as vowel.\n\nBut ""begun"" uses U which is a vowel? And we don\'t have U tested? So good.\n\nBut whichever, both are valid? I choose ""begun"" for simplicity? Since it doesn\'t repeat E.\n\nSo guess: ""begun""\n\n<guess>begun</guess>Based on the feedback:\n- Guess 1 (""roast"") eliminated R, O, A, S, T.\n- Guess 2 (""medic"") shows E as correct in position 2 and eliminates M, D, I, C.\n- Excluded letters: R, O, A, S, T, M, D, I, C.\n- Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n- Secret word format: _ E _ _ _.\n\nTo maximize information from new letters, the next guess uses B, G, U, and N (common letters from the available pool) while fixing E in position 2. ""Begun"" is a valid 5-letter word that fits this structure and tests new vowels and consonants. It avoids reused or excluded letters.\n\n<guess>begun</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: roast -> FEEDBACK: R(x) O(x) A(x) S(x) T(x)\nGuess 2: medic -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(✓) D(x) I(x) C(x)\nGuess 3: begun -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(✓) G(x) U(x) N(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have the following feedback:
- From Guess 1 (roast): R, O, A, S, T are not in the word at all.
- From Guess 2 (medic): M, D, I, C are not in the word. E is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- From Guess 3 (begun): B, G, U, N are not in the word. E is again confirmed in position 2 (which we already knew).

So, the secret word has the second letter as E, and the following letters are excluded: R, O, A, S, T, M, D, I, C, B, G, U, N.

Now, the available letters are: F, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The word structure is: _ E _ _ _

We need to form a 5-letter word with E in the second position, using only the available letters.

Let's list possible words:

- We need to fill positions 1, 3, 4, 5 with letters from {F, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z}.

Common words that fit:
- ""JEWEL"": But J is available, E is fixed, W is available, E again? But we don't know if E is repeated? However, we have to use available letters. But ""JEWEL"" has E at position 2 and 4? And L at the end. But we have to check if the letters are available: J, W, L are available? Yes. But note: we have not excluded E? But we know E is in the word at position 2, but we don't know if it appears again. However, in ""JEWEL"", we are using E at position 4? That might be acceptable? But we are trying to test new letters? Using E again might not give new information? But if the secret word has E at position 4, we get a hit? Otherwise, we know it's not there? But we have limited letters? Also, ""JEWEL"" has two E's? So we are testing J, W, L? And E at position 4? But we are allowed to use E? It's not excluded? But we are trying to cover as many new letters as possible? So using E again might be inefficient? But we have to form a valid word.

Alternatively, avoid repeating E? But it might be hard? Because we have few vowels left? The available vowels are only Y? And sometimes W? But we have U? U is excluded? From ""begun"": U(x) -> excluded? So no U. Vowels available: only Y? And we have E already? So the word must have Y? Or no other vowels? But we can have words without vowels? But English words have vowels? So we need Y? Or we can have words with Y as vowel? Or we can use W? But W is consonant? So the only vowel available is Y? Because E is already used? And we cannot use A, I, O, U? They are excluded? So the secret word must have Y? Or it might have E repeated? But we don't know.

Therefore, we should consider words that include Y? Because without Y, we might not have a vowel? But we have E at position 2? So the other positions can be consonants? But we need a vowel? Not necessarily? For example, ""myth"" has Y? But we need 5 letters? And position 2 is E? So the word must have E at position 2? And then other letters? But we can have words like ""DEBYE"" but D excluded? Not.

So let's think of words with Y? And E at position 2.

For example:
- ""KEYED"": But E at position 2? K(1), E(2), Y(3), E(4), D(5) -> D excluded? Invalid.
- ""JEY"" not 5 letters.
- ""HEY"" not 5.

""EYRIE"": E at position 1? Not position 2? We need position 2 E? So ""EYRIE"" is E,Y,R,I,E -> R and I excluded? Invalid.

""LYCEE"": L,Y,C,E,E -> C excluded? Invalid.

""PYGMY"": P,Y,G,M,Y -> G and M excluded? Invalid.

""WHEYS"": W,H,E,Y,S -> S excluded? Invalid.

""FJELD"": F,J,E,L,D -> D excluded? Invalid.

This is challenging.

Another idea: perhaps the word has Y in it? And we use it? But we need a word with E at position 2 and Y somewhere.

For example: 
- ""LEVY"": not 5 letters.
- ""LEERY"": L,E,E,R,Y -> R excluded? Invalid.
- ""PEWIT"": P,E,W,I,T -> I and T excluded? Invalid.

Perhaps we need to use Y in position 1,3,4, or 5? And E at 2.

Let me list possible words from the available letters: F, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word: [F/H/J/K/L/P/Q/V/W/X/Y/Z] E [F/H/J/K/L/P/Q/V/W/X/Y/Z] [F/H/J/K/L/P/Q/V/W/X/Y/Z] [F/H/J/K/L/P/Q/V/W/X/Y/Z]

And it must be a valid English word.

Some possibilities:
- ""HELLO"": but O excluded? And L repeated? Also O excluded? Invalid.
- ""JELLY"": J,E,L,L,Y -> but we have L repeated? And Y? Now, letters: J, L, Y are available? Yes. And E at position 2? So ""JELLY"" is J(1), E(2), L(3), L(4), Y(5). But L is repeated? We can do that? The word is valid? Yes. And it uses J, L, Y? But L twice? So we are testing J, L, Y? But L is tested twice? If L is not in the word, we get two x's? But if L is in the word, we might get one or two hits? But it's acceptable? But we are using one letter twice? Which means we are not testing as many new letters? But we have to form a word? So it might be necessary.

Another word: ""KEVEL"": K,E,V,E,L -> E repeated? And V, L? But E at position 2 and 4? So ""KEVEL"" is K(1),E(2),V(3),E(4),L(5). But we are using E twice? And V, L? But we know E at position 2? So we are testing K, V, L? And E at position 4? But again, we are repeating E? And we have only 4 new letters? But we are testing 3 new letters? Because E is repeated? So not efficient? But we have to.

Another: ""PEWEE"": P,E,W,E,E -> E repeated? And W? But P and W? But E at position 2,4,5? And we know position 2 E? So we are testing P, W? And E at 4 and 5? But only two new letters? Not good.

""YELP"": not 5 letters.

""YELPS"": Y,E,L,P,S -> S excluded? Invalid.

""YEW"" not 5.

""YEUKS"": Y,E,U,K,S -> U and S excluded? Invalid.

""YEXES"": Y,E,X,E,S -> S excluded? Invalid.

""YECCH"": Y,E,C,C,H -> C excluded? Invalid.

""YE"": not 5.

""KEEPS"": K,E,E,P,S -> S excluded? Invalid.

""HEFTY"": H,E,F,T,Y -> T excluded? Invalid.

""HELIX"": H,E,L,I,X -> I excluded? Invalid.

""HELLY"": H,E,L,L,Y -> H, L, Y? And E at 2? So ""HELLY"" is a word? Meaning? I think it's a valid word (a type of boat or something)? But let's assume it's valid? Or ""JELLY"" is more common.

""HELVE"": H,E,L,V,E -> E repeated? And V? But H, L, V? And E at 2 and 5? So ""HELVE"" is H(1),E(2),L(3),V(4),E(5). We are testing H, L, V? And E at position 5? But we are using E twice? So only three new letters? But we have to.

""HEVEA"": H,E,V,E,A -> A excluded? Invalid.

""HEXAD"": H,E,X,A,D -> A and D excluded? Invalid.

""HEXED"": H,E,X,E,D -> D excluded? Invalid.

""HEXER"": H,E,X,E,R -> R excluded? Invalid.

""HEXYL"": H,E,X,Y,L -> H, X, Y, L? And E at 2? So ""HEXYL"" is a word? In chemistry? Valid? Yes. So H(1),E(2),X(3),Y(4),L(5). This uses H, X, Y, L? All new letters? And no repeats? Perfect? We are testing four new letters: H, X, Y, L.

And it doesn't repeat E? So we get maximum information.

Is ""HEXYL"" a valid word? Yes, it is a chemical term for a radical.

So we can use ""HEXYL"".

Another option: ""JEWEL"" we thought earlier? J,E,W,E,L -> but E repeated? And W, L? But ""HEXYL"" has no repeat and four new letters? Better.

""KEXES"": K,E,X,E,S -> S excluded? Invalid.

""LEVEE"": L,E,V,E,E -> E repeated? And V? But L and V? And we know E at 2? So not as good.

""PEWIT"": has I? Invalid.

""VEXED"": V,E,X,E,D -> D excluded? Invalid.

""WEXED"": not common? And D? Invalid.

""YELMS"": Y,E,L,M,S -> M and S excluded? Invalid.

So ""HEXYL"" seems a good choice.

Therefore, we guess ""HEXYL"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""roast""** → All letters (R, O, A, S, T) are **absent** from the secret word.  
- **Guess 2: ""medic""** → Only **E** is **correct and in position 2**. Letters M, D, I, C are **absent**.  
- **Guess 3: ""begun""** → Only **E** is **correct and in position 2** (reaffirmed). Letters B, G, U, N are **absent**.  

### Key Insights:
1. **Secret word structure**: The second letter is **E** (confirmed by both Guess 2 and 3).  
   - Format: `_ E _ _ _`
2. **Excluded letters (15 total)**: R, O, A, S, T (from Guess 1), M, D, I, C (from Guess 2), B, G, U, N (from Guess 3).  
3. **Available letters (11 remaining)**: F, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
4. **Constraints**:  
   - The word must include **E only in position 2** (no evidence of repetition, but E can be reused if necessary).  
   - Focus on testing **new, high-frequency consonants** (e.g., L, H, P) and the **vowel Y** (since A, I, O, U are excluded, Y is the only untested vowel-like letter).  
   - Avoid repeating letters from failed guesses to maximize information gain.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Prioritize words** that:  
  - Use **E in position 2**.  
  - Include **multiple new letters** from the available pool (especially H, L, Y, X for broad coverage).  
  - Avoid reused letters to test as many new positions as possible.  
- **Optimal candidate**: ""HEXYL"" (valid 5-letter word).  
  - **Structure**: H (position 1), E (position 2, fixed), X (position 3), Y (position 4), L (position 5).  
  - **Why ""HEXYL""?**  
    - Tests **4 new letters**: H, X, Y, L (all high-value: L and H are common consonants; X and Y are less common but critical to check).  
    - Uses **Y as a vowel substitute** (essential since no other vowels are available).  
    - No letter repetition (efficient for information gain).  
    - Real word (scientific term for a chemical radical).  

If ""HEXYL"" is incorrect, feedback on H, X, Y, L will significantly narrow possibilities (e.g., revealing if Y is present or if L/H are key consonants).

<guess>hexyl</guess>",hexyl,"We have the following feedback:
- From Guess 1 (roast): R, O, A, S, T are not in the word at all.
- From Guess 2 (medic): M, D, I, C are not in the word. E is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- From Guess 3 (begun): B, G, U, N are not in the word. E is again confirmed in position 2 (which we already knew).

So, the secret word has the second letter as E, and the following letters are excluded: R, O, A, S, T, M, D, I, C, B, G, U, N.

Now, the available letters are: F, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Perhaps we need to use Y in position 1,3,4, or 5? And E at 2.

Let me list possible words from the available letters: F, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word: [F/H/J/K/L/P/Q/V/W/X/Y/Z] E [F/H/J/K/L/P/Q/V/W/X/Y/Z] [F/H/J/K/L/P/Q/V/W/X/Y/Z] [F/H/J/K/L/P/Q/V/W/X/Y/Z]

And it must be a valid English word.

- ""HELLO"": but O excluded? And L repeated? Also O excluded? Invalid.
- ""JELLY"": J,E,L,L,Y -> but we have L repeated? And Y? Now, letters: J, L, Y are available? Yes. And E at position 2? So ""JELLY"" is J(1), E(2), L(3), L(4), Y(5). But L is repeated? We can do that? The word is valid? Yes. And it uses J, L, Y? But L twice? So we are testing J, L, Y? But L is tested twice? If L is not in the word, we get two x's? But if L is in the word, we might get one or two hits? But it's acceptable? But we are using one letter twice? Which means we are not testing as many new letters? But we have to form a word? So it might be necessary.

Another word: ""KEVEL"": K,E,V,E,L -> E repeated? And V, L? But E at position 2 and 4? So ""KEVEL"" is K(1),E(2),V(3),E(4),L(5). But we are using E twice? And V, L? But we know E at position 2? So we are testing K, V, L? And E at position 4? But again, we are repeating E? And we have only 4 new letters? But we are testing 3 new letters? Because E is repeated? So not efficient? But we have to.

Another: ""PEWEE"": P,E,W,E,E -> E repeated? And W? But P and W? But E at position 2,4,5? And we know position 2 E? So we are testing P, W? And E at 4 and 5? But only two new letters? Not good.

""YELP"": not 5 letters.

""YELPS"": Y,E,L,P,S -> S excluded? Invalid.

""YEW"" not 5.

""YEUKS"": Y,E,U,K,S -> U and S excluded? Invalid.

""YEXES"": Y,E,X,E,S -> S excluded? Invalid.

""YECCH"": Y,E,C,C,H -> C excluded? Invalid.

""YE"": not 5.

""KEEPS"": K,E,E,P,S -> S excluded? Invalid.

""HEFTY"": H,E,F,T,Y -> T excluded? Invalid.

""HELIX"": H,E,L,I,X -> I excluded? Invalid.

""HELLY"": H,E,L,L,Y -> H, L, Y? And E at 2? So ""HELLY"" is a word? Meaning? I think it's a valid word (a type of boat or something)? But let's assume it's valid? Or ""JELLY"" is more common.

""HELVE"": H,E,L,V,E -> E repeated? And V? But H, L, V? And E at 2 and 5? So ""HELVE"" is H(1),E(2),L(3),V(4),E(5). We are testing H, L, V? And E at position 5? But we are using E twice? So only three new letters? But we have to.

""HEVEA"": H,E,V,E,A -> A excluded? Invalid.

""HEXAD"": H,E,X,A,D -> A and D excluded? Invalid.

""HEXED"": H,E,X,E,D -> D excluded? Invalid.

""HEXER"": H,E,X,E,R -> R excluded? Invalid.

""HEXYL"": H,E,X,Y,L -> H, X, Y, L? And E at 2? So ""HEXYL"" is a word? In chemistry? Valid? Yes. So H(1),E(2),X(3),Y(4),L(5). This uses H, X, Y, L? All new letters? And no repeats? Perfect? We are testing four new letters: H, X, Y, L.

And it doesn't repeat E? So we get maximum information.

Is ""HEXYL"" a valid word? Yes, it is a chemical term for a radical.

So we can use ""HEXYL"".

Another option: ""JEWEL"" we thought earlier? J,E,W,E,L -> but E repeated? And W, L? But ""HEXYL"" has no repeat and four new letters? Better.

""KEXES"": K,E,X,E,S -> S excluded? Invalid.

""LEVEE"": L,E,V,E,E -> E repeated? And V? But L and V? And we know E at 2? So not as good.

""PEWIT"": has I? Invalid.

""VEXED"": V,E,X,E,D -> D excluded? Invalid.

""WEXED"": not common? And D? Invalid.

""YELMS"": Y,E,L,M,S -> M and S excluded? Invalid.

So ""HEXYL"" seems a good choice.

Therefore, we guess ""HEXYL"".

<guess>hexyl</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""roast""** → All letters (R, O, A, S, T) are **absent** from the secret word.  
- **Guess 2: ""medic""** → Only **E** is **correct and in position 2**. Letters M, D, I, C are **absent**.  
- **Guess 3: ""begun""** → Only **E** is **correct and in position 2** (reaffirmed). Letters B, G, U, N are **absent**.  

### Key Insights:
1. **Secret word structure**: The second letter is **E** (confirmed by both Guess 2 and 3).  
   - Format: `_ E _ _ _`
2. **Excluded letters (15 total)**: R, O, A, S, T (from Guess 1), M, D, I, C (from Guess 2), B, G, U, N (from Guess 3).  
3. **Available letters (11 remaining)**: F, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
4. **Constraints**:  
   - The word must include **E only in position 2** (no evidence of repetition, but E can be reused if necessary).  
   - Focus on testing **new, high-frequency consonants** (e.g., L, H, P) and the **vowel Y** (since A, I, O, U are excluded, Y is the only untested vowel-like letter).  
   - Avoid repeating letters from failed guesses to maximize information gain.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Prioritize words** that:  
  - Use **E in position 2**.  
  - Include **multiple new letters** from the available pool (especially H, L, Y, X for broad coverage).  
  - Avoid reused letters to test as many new positions as possible.  
- **Optimal candidate**: ""HEXYL"" (valid 5-letter word).  
  - **Structure**: H (position 1), E (position 2, fixed), X (position 3), Y (position 4), L (position 5).  
  - **Why ""HEXYL""?**  
    - Tests **4 new letters**: H, X, Y, L (all high-value: L and H are common consonants; X and Y are less common but critical to check).  
    - Uses **Y as a vowel substitute** (essential since no other vowels are available).  
    - No letter repetition (efficient for information gain).  
    - Real word (scientific term for a chemical radical).  

If ""HEXYL"" is incorrect, feedback on H, X, Y, L will significantly narrow possibilities (e.g., revealing if Y is present or if L/H are key consonants).",Guess 4: hexyl -> FEEDBACK: H(x) E(✓) X(x) Y(x) L(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has three vowels and two common consonants. I'll go with ""ROAST"".

 R, O, A, S, T are all common letters. This might give us good information.

 So, my first guess is ""ROAST"".

<guess>roast</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: roast -> FEEDBACK: R(x) O(x) A(x) S(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for our first guess ""roast"": R(x) O(x) A(x) S(x) T(x)
 This means that none of the letters R, O, A, S, T are in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, we must avoid using any of these letters in our next guess.

 Considering that, we need to choose a word that uses different letters. We should pick common letters that haven't been tried.

 The remaining vowels are E, I, U (since A and O are out). Consonants: we have many left like B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Since we have no correct letters, we want to maximize new information. So we should include more common vowels and consonants.

 Common letters in English: E, I, L, N, U, etc. We can also consider words with repeated letters? But typically for second guess we avoid repeats since we have 5-letter unique words? Actually, Wordle allows repeated letters but in this case, since we haven't seen any, maybe we avoid for now.

 A good candidate might be ""CLINE"". However, C and L are common. Alternatively, ""DEUCE"" has two E's and U. But it has E twice? Maybe let's pick a word without repeats.

 Another idea: ""PLUCK"" uses P, L, U, C, K. But U is a vowel? Or we can choose ""NYMPH"" but it has Y (which can be vowel) and is not very common.

 Important: We need to cover as many common letters as possible.

 Common letters remaining: E (most common), then I, L, N, U, D, M, H, C, etc.

 I propose a word that uses E and I (vowels) and three common consonants: L, N, D, H, C, etc.

 Example: ""LINED"" -> L, I, N, E, D. This gives us two vowels (I, E) and three consonants (L, N, D).

 But note: we have already eliminated R,O,A,S,T so we must avoid them.

 Alternatively, ""CHIME"": C, H, I, M, E. This covers E, C, H, I, M.

 Another one: ""LEECH"" but it has repeated E? And H at end. Better to avoid repeats? Yes, because we don't know if there is repetition.

 Let me choose ""CHIME"". It has C, H, I, M, E. All new letters and covers common vowels and consonants.

 But note: there might be a word that covers more frequent letters? E, I are high frequency.

 Alternatively, ""QUERY"" but Q is rare and we have eliminated R? R is already eliminated so we must not use R.

 Another candidate: ""FILCH"" has F, I, L, C, H. F is less common? Maybe skip.

 How about ""MEDIC""? M, E, D, I, C. That's M, E, D, I, C. Also good because it covers E and I.

 Let me choose ""MEDIC"". It uses M, E, D, I, C.

 However, note that ""CHIME"" is also good. I'll go with ""MEDIC"" because D and C are very common.

 Wait, another idea: ""PINEY"", but Y is sometimes vowel and we haven't tested Y? But we are avoiding R,O,A,S,T so P,I,N,E,Y. But Y is the last letter and might be less common? Actually, Y is common in words as a vowel.

 But let me stick to ""MEDIC"".

 Alternatively, ""ELUDE""? E, L, U, D, E. Wait, repeated E? Not allowed? The rules don't say repeated letters are disallowed, but in the guess we can have repeated letters? However, the word must be valid. But for efficiency, we might want to avoid repeats to cover more letters.

 Since we didn't get any positive feedback, we want to test as many new letters as possible. Therefore, we should avoid repeating letters in this guess?

 Absolutely. So ""ELUDE"" has two E's so it's not ideal. Similarly, ""LEECH"" is no.

 So ""MEDIC"" is unique letters: M, E, D, I, C.

 Therefore, I choose ""MEDIC"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""roast"" – where none of the letters (R, O, A, S, T) are in the secret word – we need to avoid those letters entirely in our next guess. 

To maximize information, we should test new common vowels and consonants. The word ""**medic**"" incorporates:
- **M, E, D, I, C**: These are high-frequency letters (avoiding the eliminated ones)  
- Covers 2 new vowels (E, I) and 3 new consonants (M, D, C)  
- Helps quickly check if any of these dominant letters appear in the secret word  

This strategic guess narrows possibilities while adhering to the feedback.

<guess>medic</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: roast -> FEEDBACK: R(x) O(x) A(x) S(x) T(x)
Guess 2: medic -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(✓) D(x) I(x) C(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two guesses and their feedback:
1. ""roast"" -> all letters incorrect: R, O, A, S, T are not in the word at all.
2. ""medic"" -> M(x), E(✓), D(x), I(x), C(x). 
   - This means that only E is in the word and it's in the correct position. Specifically, E is the second letter because in ""medic"":
        Position 1: M -> x
        Position 2: E -> ✓ -> so the secret word has E as the second letter.
   - The other letters M, D, I, C are not in the word at all.

Therefore, we know:
- The second letter is E.
- Letters that are definitely not in the word: R, O, A, S, T, M, D, I, C.

Available letters: We can use any letters except those excluded: R,O,A,S,T,M,D,I,C.

We need to form a 5-letter word where:
- The second letter is E.
- The word must not contain any of the excluded letters.

Common letters left: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. And we have vowels: U and Y (since A, E, I, O are used; note E is placed but cannot use I or O or A). But wait E is placed so we have E in the word, but we can use other vowels? Actually, we have to use new letters that aren't excluded.

Vowels available: U (and sometimes Y, W act as vowels). We can use U and Y.

Structure: The word is: ? E ? ? ?

We need to choose a word that uses only remaining letters: 
Available: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to cover common letters to gather more information. Common consonants: H, L, N, P, etc.

Possible guesses:

Let's list some words that fit:
- HAVE: H, A, V, E -> but A is excluded (from first guess). Invalid.
- HAVE is no because A is excluded.

We need words without A, and without the other excluded letters.

Examples:
- JEWEL: J, E, W, E, L -> but second letter is E? Actually: J(1), E(2), W(3), E(4), L(5). So position 2 is E. But note it has E twice. Also, letters: J, W, E, L. E is already known, so we are testing J, W, L. However, E appears again? But we don't know if E repeats. We are allowed to guess repeated letters? The rules don't forbid it, but since E is already known to be in position 2, it might be redundant? Not necessarily, if E appears twice we can get a - or ✓ for the second E? However, currently we only know one E. But if we guess a word with two E's, we can test if there is a second E.

But we need to avoid excluded letters. Checking: J is available, E is allowed (but we know it's in position 2, so position 4 if we put E would be another test), W, L.

But note: E in position 4: if the secret word does not have E in position 4, but has E elsewhere, we might get a - sign? Actually, the feedback would say - if it's somewhere else? But we already have E in position 2 correct. However, we are testing for other letters too.

But let's avoid repeats for now? Because we want to maximize the number of new letters? Since we don't know, maybe keep it simple.

Another word: ""LEECH"" -> L, E, E, C, H -> but C is excluded? C was in the excluded list from guess 2.

No, C is excluded (from ""medic"": C(x)).

So let's avoid using E again if possible? To test more letters.

Options:
- ""FEIGN"" -> F, E, I, G, N -> I is excluded? From guess 2: I(x). So I is excluded? Yes, because I got x.

Excluded letters: R, O, A, S, T, M, D, I, C.

So in ""FEIGN"": I is excluded -> invalid.

- ""NEVER"" -> N, E, V, E, R -> but R is excluded? R was in first guess with x -> invalid.

- ""HELP"" -> H, E, L, P -> only 4 letters? Must be 5 letters.

We need 5-letter words.

Perhaps:
- ""BEVEL"": B, E, V, E, L -> uses E twice? But B, V, L are new.
But E appears at position 2 and position 5? Positions: B(1), E(2), V(3), E(4), L(5). Actually, position 4 would be E? But we are going to have position 2 E known, so we are testing B, V, L at positions 1,3,5 and also testing if position 4 is E? That might be inefficient because if we don't get a second E, it doesn't help as much? But we can try.

However, we are allowed to do so.

Another word: ""FJELD"" -> F, J, E, L, D -> D is excluded? From guess 2, D(x) -> invalid.

Let's find words that only use available letters: B, F, G, H, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z and the vowel U or Y? And not using E again? But E is in a known position so we can skip other E? Or we can use E? Actually, we might want to test for repetition? Since we don't know.

Alternatively, avoid E repetition for more coverage? We have few guesses left.

Another candidate: ""BLEWY"" -> not valid? Let's list:

""BEVY"" is not 5 letters.

Actually: 
- ""LEVEL"" -> L,E,V,E,L -> but L repeated? And position 2 is E -> good? But V is included. However: letters: L, E, V -> but V, L are new? And we test if E is at position 4? And L at beginning and end? But it has two L's and two E's? Also, L and E are being tested? However, we don't know if L is in the word? Actually, the secret word might have L? We haven't tested.

But the excluded letters: we cannot use R,O,A,S,T,M,D,I,C -> LEVEL uses L, E, V -> L and V are allowed.

But: positions:
Position 1: L -> new
Position 2: E -> ✓ (we know)
Position 3: V -> new
Position 4: E -> we don't know? This would test position 4.
Position 5: L -> same as position 1? So if L is in the word? But wait, testing two positions for L? Might be useful.

But the word ""level"" is valid? Well, LEVEL is a word.

Alternatively, let me try ""BLEEP"" -> B, L, E, E, P -> valid? But P is allowed? And E at 3rd and 4th? Actually position 2: we are expecting E -> so we need to have E at position 2? No: the structure we need is any second letter E.

For ""BLEEP"": positions are B(1), L(2), E(3), E(4), P(5) -> but position 2 is L? It must be E? So that guess would be invalid? Because we don't have E in the second position? For our guess, we must have E in the second position? Because we know that the secret word has E as the second letter? So in our guess, we must put E in the second position? Otherwise, we might get a - or x for E? But the feedback for E would be - if it's in another position? But we want to use the known E to keep position 2 correct? Actually, we can change? But it's not necessary? Because if we put E elsewhere and get ✓, we would know? But we only know position 2 has E? So we can try putting E at another position? However, to maximize efficiency, we can perhaps keep position 2 as E? That way we have 4 other positions? Or we can move E to test? But since we don't know if there is another E, we can try.

But it might be better to have position 2 fixed as E to lock that position? Then test other letters? Then we know always one letter is E and in place? So we can focus on the rest.

Given that, let's fix position 2 as E and choose other letters from the available pool.

So guess: [first] E [third] [fourth] [fifth]

Letters: first, third, fourth, fifth must be from {B, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z} excluding already excluded? As above, as long as not in excluded letters.

Common combinations: 
- Words like ""BELOW"" -> but O is excluded? O is excluded? From first guess: O(x) -> invalid.
- ""BEING"" -> I excluded? From guess 2 -> invalid.
- ""HONEY"" -> O excluded? Invalid.
- ""KEYED"" -> E at fourth? Also D excluded -> invalid.

Try ""LENES"" -> L,E,N,E,S -> S excluded? From first guess? S(x) -> invalid.

Another: ""BELLE"" -> B, E, L, L, E -> repeated E and L? And second letter E? Positions: B(1), E(2), L(3), L(4), E(5). Uses B, L, E -> L is new? So we test B and L? But two L's.

Better words?
How about ""UVEA"" -> too short.

Perhaps: ""QUEUE"" -> Q, U, E, U, E -> second position E? No, position 1:Q,2:U, etc -> not E in second?

Need word: _ E _ _ _

Options:
- ""FEIGN"" -> not allowed because I excluded? Yes.
- ""NEIGH"" -> N, E, I, G, H -> I excluded? Invalid.

Without I: 
- ""LEGAL"" -> L,E,G,A -> but A excluded? Invalid.

Available vowels: U and Y.

So words with U or Y in them? Or all consonants?

Example: ""DEUCE"" -> D excluded? Invalid.
- ""YEUKY"" -> not valid word.

""YEXES"" -> but X and S? S excluded.

Common word: ""HONEY"" -> O excluded? No, O is excluded.

Another: ""FLUKE"" -> F, L, U, K, E -> but E at fifth? We have E at position 2 -> so we need E at position 2? But FLUKE has E at position 5? So to avoid having E at all? Or have at position 2? If we use FLUKE, position 2 is L, which we don't know? Then feedback: position 5 E might be ✓ or x? But we know E is in the word? So if we put E at position 5, it might get ✓ if it is indeed there? But we also have position 2? We don't know position 2? We do know position 2 is E? So it's better to use a word that has E at position 2? To keep that spot? Otherwise, we lose a chance? Or get more info?

Let me clarify: the secret word has E in position 2? So if we guess a word without E at position 2, then E (if at position 5) might get marked with - or ✓? If at position 5, ✓ would mean the secret has E at position 5? But we already know E at position 2? So the word could have two E's? Or if we don't have E at position 2, then we'd get feedback that position 2 is not E? But it is E in the secret? So that would be wasteful? Because we already know it's E? So we always want E at position 2? To lock that? Then we don't have to retest? And we focus on the other letters? Yes.

Therefore, we stick with having E in position 2? So the guess must have the second letter E? Then we can concentrate on discovering the other letters? So all guesses going forward should have E in position 2? Until we know more? Or we have the full word.

So: guess pattern: [letter] E [letter] [letter] [letter]

We need to pick word of the form X E Y Z W.

Available letters: all except excluded: R,O,A,S,T,M,D,I,C.

So available: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,N,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

We also have to avoid using excluded letters? And we want to cover common letters to narrow down.

Let me list possible words:
- ""BELOW"": includes O -> excluded? O is excluded -> no.
- ""BENCH"": C excluded? C from ""medic"" got x -> excluded? So invalid.
- ""FENCE"": E? But in addition to position 2? And C excluded? Invalid.
- ""JELLY"": J,E,L,L,Y -> Y at the end? And L repeated. But letters: J,L,Y -> new? So valid? Word.

JELLY: J,E,L,L,Y -> positions: J(1),E(2),(L at 3 and 4), Y(5). But it has two L's? We can do that? The word is acceptable? But we risk that L might be in the word once? But if it isn't, we duplicate? Or we can get feedback.

Another: ""LEVEL"" -> L,E,V,E,L -> but E at 4? Will be tested? And V? Levels? Valid? But E is at 2 and 4? Which we already know for position 2? So we can test if E is at position 4? And V and L? But we have two L's? Might be inefficient? Especially since we have limited guesses.

Better to pick a word with entirely new letters? Covering as many new common letters as possible.

Available: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,N,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Common letters: L, H, N, P, U, B, etc.

How about ""BLUEY""? Not valid? ""BLEAK"" -> A excluded? Invalid.

""PLUME"": P,L,U,M,E -> M excluded? From ""medic"": M(x)? M is excluded? Invalid.

""FUNKY"": F,U,N,K,Y -> all new? And not excluded? F,U,N,K,Y are not excluded. Second letter E needed? ""FUNKY"" is F, U, N, K, Y? Position 2 is U? but we need position 2 to be E? So not this word? Because we want E at position 2? So we cannot just have any word? Must have E at position 2.

Correct form is X E Y Z W.

""FUNKY"" doesn't have E.

What about:
- ""QUEEN"": Q,U,E,E,N -> good? Positions: Q(1), U(2)? U at position 2? We need E at position 2? But ""queen"" has E at position 3 and 4? Not position 2? So wrong pattern? We require the second letter to be E? But ""queen"" has second letter U? So it would be: positions:1:Q,2:U,3:E,4:E,5:N? Then feedback for E? We know secret has E at position 2? So if we guess ""queen"", position 2 U: if U is not in word? x? And E would be marked at position 3 and 4: if at position 3? But secret has E only at position 2? Then position 3 E might be x? Then position 2 U gets x? But we know position 2 is E? So that guess wastes position 2? We might still get U? Or not? The feedback for position 2 U will be ""x"" because the secret has E at position 2? Not U? So position 2: U is not E and U is not in the word? It would get x? Then positions 3 and 4, E would be at? But we know E is only at position 2? But secret might have more E's? If secret has E at position 3 as well? That's possible? But currently we only know position 2 E? So we don't know about others? Therefore, guessing a word without E at position 2 could be useful if we also include E elsewhere? To test for multiple E's? But it may not be efficient with only 6 tries? It's risky? Also, in this case, we would get position 2 U: if we guess ""queen"", feedback might be: position 1 Q? Then U? which will be x because position 2 must be E? Then E at position 3 or 4, if secret has E at position 3, it would be marked as - or ✓? But we don't know if secret has E elsewhere? So we can test? But we have E at position 2 confirmed? And we don't know about other positions? So perhaps we can use other guesses? But since we have 4 tries left? Maybe we stick to having E at position 2? So we can focus on the first, third, fourth, fifth letters? And not test E again? Or only if convenient? But let's focus on the available letters.

A good word: ""PENAL"": P,E,N,A,L -> but A excluded? From the first feedback? A(x) -> invalid.

""NEXUS"": N,E,X,U,S -> S excluded? Invalid.

""BELCH"": B,E,L,C,H -> C excluded? Invalid.

How about ""YEH"" -> not 5 letters.

""WEEDY"": W,E,E,D,Y -> D excluded? D(x) -> invalid.

""VERGE"": V,E,R,G,E -> R excluded? Invalid.

This is difficult.

Let's think of words with common available letters: U, L, N, H, etc.

""EU K something"" but second letter E: so words like:
- ""LEGER"": L,E,G,E,R -> R excluded? Invalid.
- ""HEDGE"": H,E,D,G,E -> D excluded? Invalid.
- ""LEVEL"" we thought earlier? But let's try something without excluded letters.

Available: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,N,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

For example:
- ""FILE"" -> not 5 letters.
- ""FILEK"" -> ""fickle"" -> but ""fickle"" has I? I excluded? Invalid.

""JUKE"": not 5.

""BEGUN"": B,E,G,U,N -> letters: B,G,U,N -> all available? And structure: B(1),E(2),G(3),U(4),N(5) -> so ""begun"" is a word? Yes. B E G U N.

Letters: B,G,U,N are all new and available.

This is good? We haven't used any of these before? And not excluded.

So we can guess ""begun""? And check.

""Begun"" meets all criteria? Position and letters are from available set.

Another candidate: ""HELIX"": H,E,L,I,X -> I excluded? I got x? Invalid.

""VENUE"": V,E,N,U,E -> E at position 2 and 5? And U? Let's see: letters: V,N,U,E -> E is already known? And U? But ""venue"" structure: V(1),E(2),N(3),U(4),E(5). So we are testing V, N, U? And E at position 5? Which is new? But V,N,U are available? And E is known? So valid? But we are using E twice? That might be OK? But it could reveal if there's more than one E? However, we don't have a better choice? Alternatively, ""begun"" avoids doubling E.

Also, ""begun"" tests B,G,U,N? And not E repetition? Better? Since letters are different.

Similarly, ""P G U N something"" -> ""begun"" is one.

""JEG U something"" not common.

""VEGUN"" not a word.

So ""begun"" seems valid: B E G U N.

Alternatively, ""BEVAN"" is not common? ""Bevel"" -> B,E,V,E,L -> has E twice? And L? Available? But E at position 4? And V? Also good.

But ""begun"" covers G and U? Also new.

Another option: ""LEVIN"": L,E,V,I,N -> I excluded? Invalid.

""KELPY"": K,E,L,P,Y -> K,L,P,Y available? Yes? And E at position 2? So ""K E L P Y"" -> positions.

Both ""begun"" and ""kelpy"" are possible? Let's see: ""kelpy"" is a word? Yes, meaning a brown algal.

Which is better? ""begun"" has B,G,U,N? ""kelpy"" has K,L,P,Y? What letters are more common? In English, L is common, P is common, K, Y? U is common vowel? But U is less common than L? L is very common? Perhaps ""kelpy"" covers common letters? U is also common.

But to decide? We have to pick one.

In ""kelpy"" we have Y at the end? Which is also worth testing? But we don't know.

Also, ""begun"" has more vowels? U in position 4? But in the secret word, we know the second letter is E? And we don't know if there are other vowels? U could be there? But consonants? Both options have two vowels? E and U in ""begun""? In ""kelpy"" has E and Y? With Y acting as vowel.

But ""begun"" uses U which is a vowel? And we don't have U tested? So good.

But whichever, both are valid? I choose ""begun"" for simplicity? Since it doesn't repeat E.

So guess: ""begun""

<guess>begun</guess>Based on the feedback:
- Guess 1 (""roast"") eliminated R, O, A, S, T.
- Guess 2 (""medic"") shows E as correct in position 2 and eliminates M, D, I, C.
- Excluded letters: R, O, A, S, T, M, D, I, C.
- Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- Secret word format: _ E _ _ _.

To maximize information from new letters, the next guess uses B, G, U, and N (common letters from the available pool) while fixing E in position 2. ""Begun"" is a valid 5-letter word that fits this structure and tests new vowels and consonants. It avoids reused or excluded letters.

<guess>begun</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: roast -> FEEDBACK: R(x) O(x) A(x) S(x) T(x)
Guess 2: medic -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(✓) D(x) I(x) C(x)
Guess 3: begun -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(✓) G(x) U(x) N(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the following feedback:
- From Guess 1 (roast): R, O, A, S, T are not in the word at all.
- From Guess 2 (medic): M, D, I, C are not in the word. E is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- From Guess 3 (begun): B, G, U, N are not in the word. E is again confirmed in position 2 (which we already knew).

So, the secret word has the second letter as E, and the following letters are excluded: R, O, A, S, T, M, D, I, C, B, G, U, N.

Now, the available letters are: F, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The word structure is: _ E _ _ _

We need to form a 5-letter word with E in the second position, using only the available letters.

Let's list possible words:

- We need to fill positions 1, 3, 4, 5 with letters from {F, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z}.

Common words that fit:
- ""JEWEL"": But J is available, E is fixed, W is available, E again? But we don't know if E is repeated? However, we have to use available letters. But ""JEWEL"" has E at position 2 and 4? And L at the end. But we have to check if the letters are available: J, W, L are available? Yes. But note: we have not excluded E? But we know E is in the word at position 2, but we don't know if it appears again. However, in ""JEWEL"", we are using E at position 4? That might be acceptable? But we are trying to test new letters? Using E again might not give new information? But if the secret word has E at position 4, we get a hit? Otherwise, we know it's not there? But we have limited letters? Also, ""JEWEL"" has two E's? So we are testing J, W, L? And E at position 4? But we are allowed to use E? It's not excluded? But we are trying to cover as many new letters as possible? So using E again might be inefficient? But we have to form a valid word.

Alternatively, avoid repeating E? But it might be hard? Because we have few vowels left? The available vowels are only Y? And sometimes W? But we have U? U is excluded? From ""begun"": U(x) -> excluded? So no U. Vowels available: only Y? And we have E already? So the word must have Y? Or no other vowels? But we can have words without vowels? But English words have vowels? So we need Y? Or we can have words with Y as vowel? Or we can use W? But W is consonant? So the only vowel available is Y? Because E is already used? And we cannot use A, I, O, U? They are excluded? So the secret word must have Y? Or it might have E repeated? But we don't know.

Therefore, we should consider words that include Y? Because without Y, we might not have a vowel? But we have E at position 2? So the other positions can be consonants? But we need a vowel? Not necessarily? For example, ""myth"" has Y? But we need 5 letters? And position 2 is E? So the word must have E at position 2? And then other letters? But we can have words like ""DEBYE"" but D excluded? Not.

So let's think of words with Y? And E at position 2.

For example:
- ""KEYED"": But E at position 2? K(1), E(2), Y(3), E(4), D(5) -> D excluded? Invalid.
- ""JEY"" not 5 letters.
- ""HEY"" not 5.

""EYRIE"": E at position 1? Not position 2? We need position 2 E? So ""EYRIE"" is E,Y,R,I,E -> R and I excluded? Invalid.

""LYCEE"": L,Y,C,E,E -> C excluded? Invalid.

""PYGMY"": P,Y,G,M,Y -> G and M excluded? Invalid.

""WHEYS"": W,H,E,Y,S -> S excluded? Invalid.

""FJELD"": F,J,E,L,D -> D excluded? Invalid.

This is challenging.

Another idea: perhaps the word has Y in it? And we use it? But we need a word with E at position 2 and Y somewhere.

For example: 
- ""LEVY"": not 5 letters.
- ""LEERY"": L,E,E,R,Y -> R excluded? Invalid.
- ""PEWIT"": P,E,W,I,T -> I and T excluded? Invalid.

Perhaps we need to use Y in position 1,3,4, or 5? And E at 2.

Let me list possible words from the available letters: F, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word: [F/H/J/K/L/P/Q/V/W/X/Y/Z] E [F/H/J/K/L/P/Q/V/W/X/Y/Z] [F/H/J/K/L/P/Q/V/W/X/Y/Z] [F/H/J/K/L/P/Q/V/W/X/Y/Z]

And it must be a valid English word.

Some possibilities:
- ""HELLO"": but O excluded? And L repeated? Also O excluded? Invalid.
- ""JELLY"": J,E,L,L,Y -> but we have L repeated? And Y? Now, letters: J, L, Y are available? Yes. And E at position 2? So ""JELLY"" is J(1), E(2), L(3), L(4), Y(5). But L is repeated? We can do that? The word is valid? Yes. And it uses J, L, Y? But L twice? So we are testing J, L, Y? But L is tested twice? If L is not in the word, we get two x's? But if L is in the word, we might get one or two hits? But it's acceptable? But we are using one letter twice? Which means we are not testing as many new letters? But we have to form a word? So it might be necessary.

Another word: ""KEVEL"": K,E,V,E,L -> E repeated? And V, L? But E at position 2 and 4? So ""KEVEL"" is K(1),E(2),V(3),E(4),L(5). But we are using E twice? And V, L? But we know E at position 2? So we are testing K, V, L? And E at position 4? But again, we are repeating E? And we have only 4 new letters? But we are testing 3 new letters? Because E is repeated? So not efficient? But we have to.

Another: ""PEWEE"": P,E,W,E,E -> E repeated? And W? But P and W? But E at position 2,4,5? And we know position 2 E? So we are testing P, W? And E at 4 and 5? But only two new letters? Not good.

""YELP"": not 5 letters.

""YELPS"": Y,E,L,P,S -> S excluded? Invalid.

""YEW"" not 5.

""YEUKS"": Y,E,U,K,S -> U and S excluded? Invalid.

""YEXES"": Y,E,X,E,S -> S excluded? Invalid.

""YECCH"": Y,E,C,C,H -> C excluded? Invalid.

""YE"": not 5.

""KEEPS"": K,E,E,P,S -> S excluded? Invalid.

""HEFTY"": H,E,F,T,Y -> T excluded? Invalid.

""HELIX"": H,E,L,I,X -> I excluded? Invalid.

""HELLY"": H,E,L,L,Y -> H, L, Y? And E at 2? So ""HELLY"" is a word? Meaning? I think it's a valid word (a type of boat or something)? But let's assume it's valid? Or ""JELLY"" is more common.

""HELVE"": H,E,L,V,E -> E repeated? And V? But H, L, V? And E at 2 and 5? So ""HELVE"" is H(1),E(2),L(3),V(4),E(5). We are testing H, L, V? And E at position 5? But we are using E twice? So only three new letters? But we have to.

""HEVEA"": H,E,V,E,A -> A excluded? Invalid.

""HEXAD"": H,E,X,A,D -> A and D excluded? Invalid.

""HEXED"": H,E,X,E,D -> D excluded? Invalid.

""HEXER"": H,E,X,E,R -> R excluded? Invalid.

""HEXYL"": H,E,X,Y,L -> H, X, Y, L? And E at 2? So ""HEXYL"" is a word? In chemistry? Valid? Yes. So H(1),E(2),X(3),Y(4),L(5). This uses H, X, Y, L? All new letters? And no repeats? Perfect? We are testing four new letters: H, X, Y, L.

And it doesn't repeat E? So we get maximum information.

Is ""HEXYL"" a valid word? Yes, it is a chemical term for a radical.

So we can use ""HEXYL"".

Another option: ""JEWEL"" we thought earlier? J,E,W,E,L -> but E repeated? And W, L? But ""HEXYL"" has no repeat and four new letters? Better.

""KEXES"": K,E,X,E,S -> S excluded? Invalid.

""LEVEE"": L,E,V,E,E -> E repeated? And V? But L and V? And we know E at 2? So not as good.

""PEWIT"": has I? Invalid.

""VEXED"": V,E,X,E,D -> D excluded? Invalid.

""WEXED"": not common? And D? Invalid.

""YELMS"": Y,E,L,M,S -> M and S excluded? Invalid.

So ""HEXYL"" seems a good choice.

Therefore, we guess ""HEXYL"".

<guess>hexyl</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""roast""** → All letters (R, O, A, S, T) are **absent** from the secret word.  
- **Guess 2: ""medic""** → Only **E** is **correct and in position 2**. Letters M, D, I, C are **absent**.  
- **Guess 3: ""begun""** → Only **E** is **correct and in position 2** (reaffirmed). Letters B, G, U, N are **absent**.  

### Key Insights:
1. **Secret word structure**: The second letter is **E** (confirmed by both Guess 2 and 3).  
   - Format: `_ E _ _ _`
2. **Excluded letters (15 total)**: R, O, A, S, T (from Guess 1), M, D, I, C (from Guess 2), B, G, U, N (from Guess 3).  
3. **Available letters (11 remaining)**: F, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
4. **Constraints**:  
   - The word must include **E only in position 2** (no evidence of repetition, but E can be reused if necessary).  
   - Focus on testing **new, high-frequency consonants** (e.g., L, H, P) and the **vowel Y** (since A, I, O, U are excluded, Y is the only untested vowel-like letter).  
   - Avoid repeating letters from failed guesses to maximize information gain.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Prioritize words** that:  
  - Use **E in position 2**.  
  - Include **multiple new letters** from the available pool (especially H, L, Y, X for broad coverage).  
  - Avoid reused letters to test as many new positions as possible.  
- **Optimal candidate**: ""HEXYL"" (valid 5-letter word).  
  - **Structure**: H (position 1), E (position 2, fixed), X (position 3), Y (position 4), L (position 5).  
  - **Why ""HEXYL""?**  
    - Tests **4 new letters**: H, X, Y, L (all high-value: L and H are common consonants; X and Y are less common but critical to check).  
    - Uses **Y as a vowel substitute** (essential since no other vowels are available).  
    - No letter repetition (efficient for information gain).  
    - Real word (scientific term for a chemical radical).  

If ""HEXYL"" is incorrect, feedback on H, X, Y, L will significantly narrow possibilities (e.g., revealing if Y is present or if L/H are key consonants).

But we don\'t know if E repeats. We are allowed to guess repeated letters? The rules don\'t forbid it, but since E is already known to be in position 2, it might be redundant? Not necessarily, if E appears twice we can get a - or ✓ for the second E? However, currently we only know one E. But if we guess a word with two E\'s, we can test if there is a second E.\n\nBut we need to avoid excluded letters. Checking: J is available, E is allowed (but we know it\'s in position 2, so position 4 if we put E would be another test), W, L.\n\nBut note: E in position 4: if the secret word does not have E in position 4, but has E elsewhere, we might get a - sign? Actually, the feedback would say - if it\'s somewhere else? But we already have E in position 2 correct. However, we are testing for other letters too.\n\nBut let\'s avoid repeats for now?

Yes, because I got x.\n\nExcluded letters: R, O, A, S, T, M, D, I, C.\n\nSo in ""FEIGN"": I is excluded -> invalid.\n\n- ""NEVER"" -> N, E, V, E, R -> but R is excluded?

But B, V, L are new.\nBut E appears at position 2 and position 5? Positions: B(1), E(2), V(3), E(4), L(5). Actually, position 4 would be E? But we are going to have position 2 E known, so we are testing B, V, L at positions 1,3,5 and also testing if position 4 is E? That might be inefficient because if we don\'t get a second E, it doesn\'t help as much? But we can try.\n\nHowever, we are allowed to do so.\n\nAnother word: ""FJELD"" -> F, J, E, L, D -> D is excluded? From guess 2, D(x) -> invalid.\n\nLet\'s find words that only use available letters: B, F, G, H, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z and the vowel U or Y? And not using E again? But E is in a known position so we can skip other E? Or we can use E? Actually, we might want to test for repetition? Since we don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, avoid E repetition for more coverage? We have few guesses left.\n\nAnother candidate: ""BLEWY"" -> not valid? Let\'s list:\n\n""BEVY"" is not 5 letters.\n\nActually: \n- ""LEVEL"" -> L,E,V,E,L -> but L repeated? And position 2 is E -> good? But V is included. However: letters: L, E, V -> but V, L are new? And we test if E is at position 4? And L at beginning and end? But it has two L\'s and two E\'s? Also, L and E are being tested? However, we don\'t know if L is in the word? Actually, the secret word might have L? We haven\'t tested.\n\nBut the excluded letters: we cannot use R,O,A,S,T,M,D,I,C -> LEVEL uses L, E, V -> L and V are allowed.\n\nBut: positions:\nPosition 1: L -> new\nPosition 2: E -> ✓ (we know)\nPosition 3: V -> new\nPosition 4: E -> we don\'t know? This would test position 4.\nPosition 5: L -> same as position 1? So if L is in the word? But wait, testing two positions for L? Might be useful.\n\nBut the word ""level"" is valid? Well, LEVEL is a word.\n\nAlternatively, let me try ""BLEEP"" -> B, L, E, E, P -> valid? But P is allowed? And E at 3rd and 4th? Actually position 2: we are expecting E -> so we need to have E at position 2? No: the structure we need is any second letter E.\n\nFor ""BLEEP"": positions are B(1), L(2), E(3), E(4), P(5) -> but position 2 is L? It must be E? So that guess would be invalid? Because we don\'t have E in the second position? For our guess, we must have E in the second position? Because we know that the secret word has E as the second letter? So in our guess, we must put E in the second position? Otherwise, we might get a - or x for E? But the feedback for E would be - if it\'s in another position? But we want to use the known E to keep position 2 correct? Actually, we can change? But it\'s not necessary? Because if we put E elsewhere and get ✓, we would know? But we only know position 2 has E? So we can try putting E at another position? However, to maximize efficiency, we can perhaps keep position 2 as E? That way we have 4 other positions? Or we can move E to test? But since we don\'t know if there is another E, we can try.\n\nBut it might be better to have position 2 fixed as E to lock that position? Then test other letters? Then we know always one letter is E and in place? So we can focus on the rest.\n\nGiven that, let\'s fix position 2 as E and choose other letters from the available pool.\n\nSo guess: [first] E [third] [fourth] [fifth]\n\nLetters: first, third, fourth, fifth must be from {B, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z} excluding already excluded? As above, as long as not in excluded letters.\n\nCommon combinations: \n- Words like ""BELOW"" -> but O is excluded? O is excluded? From first guess: O(x) -> invalid.\n- ""BEING"" -> I excluded? From guess 2 -> invalid.\n- ""HONEY"" -> O excluded? Invalid.\n- ""KEYED"" -> E at fourth? Also D excluded -> invalid.\n\nTry ""LENES"" -> L,E,N,E,S -> S excluded? From first guess? S(x) -> invalid.\n\nAnother: ""BELLE"" -> B, E, L, L, E -> repeated E and L? And second letter E? Positions: B(1), E(2), L(3), L(4), E(5). Uses B, L, E -> L is new? So we test B and L? But two L\'s.\n\nBetter words?\nHow about ""UVEA"" -> too short.\n\nPerhaps: ""QUEUE"" -> Q, U, E, U, E -> second position E? No, position 1:Q,2:U, etc -> not E in second?\n\nNeed word: _ E _ _ _\n\nOptions:\n- ""FEIGN"" -> not allowed because I excluded? Yes.\n- ""NEIGH"" -> N, E, I, G, H -> I excluded? Invalid.\n\nWithout I: \n- ""LEGAL"" -> L,E,G,A -> but A excluded? Invalid.\n\nAvailable vowels: U and Y.\n\nSo words with U or Y in them? Or all consonants?\n\nExample: ""DEUCE"" -> D excluded? Invalid.\n- ""YEUKY"" -> not valid word.\n\n""YEXES"" -> but X and S? S excluded.\n\nCommon word: ""HONEY"" -> O excluded? No, O is excluded.\n\nAnother: ""FLUKE"" -> F, L, U, K, E -> but E at fifth? We have E at position 2 -> so we need E at position 2? But FLUKE has E at position 5? So to avoid having E at all? Or have at position 2? If we use FLUKE, position 2 is L, which we don\'t know? Then feedback: position 5 E might be ✓ or x? But we know E is in the word? So if we put E at position 5, it might get ✓ if it is indeed there? But we also have position 2? We don\'t know position 2? We do know position 2 is E? So it\'s better to use a word that has E at position 2? To keep that spot? Otherwise, we lose a chance? Or get more info?\n\nLet me clarify: the secret word has E in position 2? So if we guess a word without E at position 2, then E (if at position 5) might get marked with - or ✓? If at position 5, ✓ would mean the secret has E at position 5? But we already know E at position 2? So the word could have two E\'s? Or if we don\'t have E at position 2, then we\'d get feedback that position 2 is not E? But it is E in the secret? So that would be wasteful? Because we already know it\'s E? So we always want E at position 2? To lock that? Then we don\'t have to retest? And we focus on the other letters? Yes.\n\nTherefore, we stick with having E in position 2? So the guess must have the second letter E? Then we can concentrate on discovering the other letters? So all guesses going forward should have E in position 2? Until we know more? Or we have the full word.\n\nSo: guess pattern: [letter] E [letter] [letter] [letter]\n\nWe need to pick word of the form X E Y Z W.\n\nAvailable letters: all except excluded: R,O,A,S,T,M,D,I,C.\n\nSo available: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,N,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nWe also have to avoid using excluded letters? And we want to cover common letters to narrow down.\n\nLet me list possible words:\n- ""BELOW"": includes O -> excluded? O is excluded -> no.\n- ""BENCH"": C excluded? C from ""medic"" got x -> excluded? So invalid.\n- ""FENCE"": E? But in addition to position 2? And C excluded? Invalid.\n- ""JELLY"": J,E,L,L,Y -> Y at the end? And L repeated. But letters: J,L,Y -> new? So valid? Word.\n\nJELLY: J,E,L,L,Y -> positions: J(1),E(2),(L at 3 and 4), Y(5). But it has two L\'s? We can do that? The word is acceptable? But we risk that L might be in the word once? But if it isn\'t, we duplicate? Or we can get feedback.\n\nAnother: ""LEVEL"" -> L,E,V,E,L -> but E at 4? Will be tested? And V? Levels? Valid? But E is at 2 and 4? Which we already know for position 2? So we can test if E is at position 4? And V and L? But we have two L\'s? Might be inefficient? Especially since we have limited guesses.\n\nBetter to pick a word with entirely new letters? Covering as many new common letters as possible.\n\nAvailable: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,N,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nCommon letters: L, H, N, P, U, B, etc.\n\nHow about ""BLUEY""? Not valid? ""BLEAK"" -> A excluded? Invalid.\n\n""PLUME"": P,L,U,M,E -> M excluded? From ""medic"": M(x)? M is excluded? Invalid.\n\n""FUNKY"": F,U,N,K,Y -> all new? And not excluded? F,U,N,K,Y are not excluded. Second letter E needed? ""FUNKY"" is F, U, N, K, Y? Position 2 is U? but we need position 2 to be E? So not this word? Because we want E at position 2? So we cannot just have any word? Must have E at position 2.\n\nCorrect form is X E Y Z W.\n\n""FUNKY"" doesn\'t have E.\n\nWhat about:\n- ""QUEEN"": Q,U,E,E,N -> good? Positions: Q(1), U(2)? U at position 2? We need E at position 2? But ""queen"" has E at position 3 and 4? Not position 2? So wrong pattern? We require the second letter to be E? But ""queen"" has second letter U? So it would be: positions:1:Q,2:U,3:E,4:E,5:N? Then feedback for E? We know secret has E at position 2? So if we guess ""queen"", position 2 U: if U is not in word? x? And E would be marked at position 3 and 4: if at position 3? But secret has E only at position 2? Then position 3 E might be x? Then position 2 U gets x? But we know position 2 is E? So that guess wastes position 2? We might still get U? Or not? The feedback for position 2 U will be ""x"" because the secret has E at position 2? Not U? So position 2: U is not E and U is not in the word? It would get x? Then positions 3 and 4, E would be at? But we know E is only at position 2? But secret might have more E\'s? If secret has E at position 3 as well? That\'s possible? But currently we only know position 2 E? So we don\'t know about others? Therefore, guessing a word without E at position 2 could be useful if we also include E elsewhere? To test for multiple E\'s? But it may not be efficient with only 6 tries? It\'s risky? Also, in this case, we would get position 2 U: if we guess ""queen"", feedback might be: position 1 Q? Then U? which will be x because position 2 must be E? Then E at position 3 or 4, if secret has E at position 3, it would be marked as - or ✓? But we don\'t know if secret has E elsewhere? So we can test? But we have E at position 2 confirmed? And we don\'t know about other positions? So perhaps we can use other guesses? But since we have 4 tries left? Maybe we stick to having E at position 2? So we can focus on the first, third, fourth, fifth letters? And not test E again? Or only if convenient? But let\'s focus on the available letters.\n\nA good word: ""PENAL"": P,E,N,A,L -> but A excluded? From the first feedback? A(x) -> invalid.\n\n""NEXUS"": N,E,X,U,S -> S excluded? Invalid.\n\n""BELCH"": B,E,L,C,H -> C excluded? Invalid.\n\nHow about ""YEH"" -> not 5 letters.\n\n""WEEDY"": W,E,E,D,Y -> D excluded? D(x) -> invalid.\n\n""VERGE"": V,E,R,G,E -> R excluded? Invalid.\n\nThis is difficult.\n\nLet\'s think of words with common available letters: U, L, N, H, etc.\n\n""EU K something"" but second letter E: so words like:\n- ""LEGER"": L,E,G,E,R -> R excluded? Invalid.\n- ""HEDGE"": H,E,D,G,E -> D excluded? Invalid.\n- ""LEVEL"" we thought earlier? But let\'s try something without excluded letters.\n\nAvailable: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,N,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nFor example:\n- ""FILE"" -> not 5 letters.\n- ""FILEK"" -> ""fickle"" -> but ""fickle"" has I? I excluded? Invalid.\n\n""JUKE"": not 5.\n\n""BEGUN"": B,E,G,U,N -> letters: B,G,U,N -> all available? And structure: B(1),E(2),G(3),U(4),N(5) -> so ""begun"" is a word? Yes. B E G U N.\n\nLetters: B,G,U,N are all new and available.\n\nThis is good? We haven\'t used any of these before? And not excluded.\n\nSo we can guess ""begun""? And check.\n\n""Begun"" meets all criteria? Position and letters are from available set.\n\nAnother candidate: ""HELIX"": H,E,L,I,X -> I excluded? I got x? Invalid.\n\n""VENUE"": V,E,N,U,E -> E at position 2 and 5? And U? Let\'s see: letters: V,N,U,E -> E is already known? And U? But ""venue"" structure: V(1),E(2),N(3),U(4),E(5). So we are testing V, N, U? And E at position 5? Which is new? But V,N,U are available? And E is known? So valid? But we are using E twice? That might be OK? But it could reveal if there\'s more than one E? However, we don\'t have a better choice? Alternatively, ""begun"" avoids doubling E.\n\nAlso, ""begun"" tests B,G,U,N? And not E repetition? Better? Since letters are different.\n\nSimilarly, ""P G U N something"" -> ""begun"" is one.\n\n""JEG U something"" not common.\n\n""VEGUN"" not a word.\n\nSo ""begun"" seems valid: B E G U N.\n\nAlternatively, ""BEVAN"" is not common? ""Bevel"" -> B,E,V,E,L -> has E twice? And L? Available? But E at position 4? And V? Also good.\n\nBut ""begun"" covers G and U? Also new.\n\nAnother option: ""LEVIN"": L,E,V,I,N -> I excluded? Invalid.\n\n""KELPY"": K,E,L,P,Y -> K,L,P,Y available? Yes? And E at position 2? So ""K E L P Y"" -> positions.\n\nBoth ""begun"" and ""kelpy"" are possible? Let\'s see: ""kelpy"" is a word? Yes, meaning a brown algal.\n\nWhich is better? ""begun"" has B,G,U,N? ""kelpy"" has K,L,P,Y? What letters are more common? In English, L is common, P is common, K, Y? U is common vowel? But U is less common than L? L is very common? Perhaps ""kelpy"" covers common letters? U is also common.\n\nBut to decide? We have to pick one.\n\nIn ""kelpy"" we have Y at the end? Which is also worth testing? But we don\'t know.\n\nAlso, ""begun"" has more vowels? U in position 4? But in the secret word, we know the second letter is E? And we don\'t know if there are other vowels? U could be there? But consonants? Both options have two vowels? E and U in ""begun""? In ""kelpy"" has E and Y? With Y acting as vowel.\n\nBut ""begun"" uses U which is a vowel? And we don\'t have U tested? So good.\n\nBut whichever, both are valid? I choose ""begun"" for simplicity? Since it doesn\'t repeat E.\n\nSo guess: ""begun""\n\n<guess>begun</guess>Based on the feedback:\n- Guess 1 (""roast"") eliminated R, O, A, S, T.\n- Guess 2 (""medic"") shows E as correct in position 2 and eliminates M, D, I, C.\n- Excluded letters: R, O, A, S, T, M, D, I, C.\n- Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n- Secret word format: _ E _ _ _.\n\nTo maximize information from new letters, the next guess uses B, G, U, and N (common letters from the available pool) while fixing E in position 2. ""Begun"" is a valid 5-letter word that fits this structure and tests new vowels and consonants. It avoids reused or excluded letters.\n\n<guess>begun</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: roast -> FEEDBACK: R(x) O(x) A(x) S(x) T(x)\nGuess 2: medic -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(✓) D(x) I(x) C(x)\nGuess 3: begun -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(✓) G(x) U(x) N(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the following feedback:\n- From Guess 1 (roast): R, O, A, S, T are not in the word at all.\n- From Guess 2 (medic): M, D, I, C are not in the word. E is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).\n- From Guess 3 (begun): B, G, U, N are not in the word. E is again confirmed in position 2 (which we already knew).\n\nSo, the secret word has the second letter as E, and the following letters are excluded: R, O, A, S, T, M, D, I, C, B, G, U, N.\n\nNow, the available letters are: F, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nThe word structure is: _ E _ _ _\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word with E in the second position, using only the available letters.\n\nLet\'s list possible words:\n\n- We need to fill positions 1, 3, 4, 5 with letters from {F, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z}.\n\nCommon words that fit:\n- ""JEWEL"": But J is available, E is fixed, W is available, E again? But we don\'t know if E is repeated? However, we have to use available letters. But ""JEWEL"" has E at position 2 and 4? And L at the end. But we have to check if the letters are available: J, W, L are available? Yes. But note: we have not excluded E? But we know E is in the word at position 2, but we don\'t know if it appears again. However, in ""JEWEL"", we are using E at position 4? That might be acceptable? But we are trying to test new letters? Using E again might not give new information? But if the secret word has E at position 4, we get a hit? Otherwise, we know it\'s not there? But we have limited letters? Also, ""JEWEL"" has two E\'s? So we are testing J, W, L? And E at position 4? But we are allowed to use E? It\'s not excluded? But we are trying to cover as many new letters as possible? So using E again might be inefficient? But we have to form a valid word.\n\nAlternatively, avoid repeating E? But it might be hard? Because we have few vowels left? The available vowels are only Y? And sometimes W? But we have U? U is excluded? From ""begun"": U(x) -> excluded? So no U. Vowels available: only Y? And we have E already? So the word must have Y? Or no other vowels? But we can have words without vowels? But English words have vowels? So we need Y? Or we can have words with Y as vowel? Or we can use W? But W is consonant? So the only vowel available is Y? Because E is already used? And we cannot use A, I, O, U? They are excluded? So the secret word must have Y? Or it might have E repeated? But we don\'t know.\n\nTherefore, we should consider words that include Y? Because without Y, we might not have a vowel? But we have E at position 2? So the other positions can be consonants? But we need a vowel? Not necessarily? For example, ""myth"" has Y? But we need 5 letters? And position 2 is E? So the word must have E at position 2? And then other letters? But we can have words like ""DEBYE"" but D excluded? Not.\n\nSo let\'s think of words with Y? And E at position 2.\n\nFor example:\n- ""KEYED"": But E at position 2? K(1), E(2), Y(3), E(4), D(5) -> D excluded? Invalid.\n- ""JEY"" not 5 letters.\n- ""HEY"" not 5.\n\n""EYRIE"": E at position 1? Not position 2? We need position 2 E? So ""EYRIE"" is E,Y,R,I,E -> R and I excluded? Invalid.\n\n""LYCEE"": L,Y,C,E,E -> C excluded? Invalid.\n\n""PYGMY"": P,Y,G,M,Y -> G and M excluded? Invalid.\n\n""WHEYS"": W,H,E,Y,S -> S excluded? Invalid.\n\n""FJELD"": F,J,E,L,D -> D excluded? Invalid.\n\nThis is challenging.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the word has Y in it? And we use it? But we need a word with E at position 2 and Y somewhere.\n\nFor example: \n- ""LEVY"": not 5 letters.\n- ""LEERY"": L,E,E,R,Y -> R excluded? Invalid.\n- ""PEWIT"": P,E,W,I,T -> I and T excluded? Invalid.\n\nPerhaps we need to use Y in position 1,3,4, or 5? And E at 2.\n\nLet me list possible words from the available letters: F, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe need a word: [F/H/J/K/L/P/Q/V/W/X/Y/Z] E [F/H/J/K/L/P/Q/V/W/X/Y/Z] [F/H/J/K/L/P/Q/V/W/X/Y/Z] [F/H/J/K/L/P/Q/V/W/X/Y/Z]\n\nAnd it must be a valid English word.\n\nSome possibilities:\n- ""HELLO"": but O excluded? And L repeated? Also O excluded? Invalid.\n- ""JELLY"": J,E,L,L,Y -> but we have L repeated? And Y? Now, letters: J, L, Y are available? Yes. And E at position 2? So ""JELLY"" is J(1), E(2), L(3), L(4), Y(5). But L is repeated? We can do that? The word is valid? Yes. And it uses J, L, Y? But L twice? So we are testing J, L, Y? But L is tested twice? If L is not in the word, we get two x\'s? But if L is in the word, we might get one or two hits? But it\'s acceptable? But we are using one letter twice? Which means we are not testing as many new letters? But we have to form a word? So it might be necessary.\n\nAnother word: ""KEVEL"": K,E,V,E,L -> E repeated? And V, L? But E at position 2 and 4? So ""KEVEL"" is K(1),E(2),V(3),E(4),L(5). But we are using E twice? And V, L? But we know E at position 2? So we are testing K, V, L? And E at position 4? But again, we are repeating E? And we have only 4 new letters? But we are testing 3 new letters? Because E is repeated? So not efficient? But we have to.\n\nAnother: ""PEWEE"": P,E,W,E,E -> E repeated? And W? But P and W? But E at position 2,4,5? And we know position 2 E? So we are testing P, W? And E at 4 and 5? But only two new letters? Not good.\n\n""YELP"": not 5 letters.\n\n""YELPS"": Y,E,L,P,S -> S excluded? Invalid.\n\n""YEW"" not 5.\n\n""YEUKS"": Y,E,U,K,S -> U and S excluded? Invalid.\n\n""YEXES"": Y,E,X,E,S -> S excluded? Invalid.\n\n""YECCH"": Y,E,C,C,H -> C excluded? Invalid.\n\n""YE"": not 5.\n\n""KEEPS"": K,E,E,P,S -> S excluded? Invalid.\n\n""HEFTY"": H,E,F,T,Y -> T excluded? Invalid.\n\n""HELIX"": H,E,L,I,X -> I excluded? Invalid.\n\n""HELLY"": H,E,L,L,Y -> H, L, Y? And E at 2? So ""HELLY"" is a word? Meaning? I think it\'s a valid word (a type of boat or something)? But let\'s assume it\'s valid? Or ""JELLY"" is more common.\n\n""HELVE"": H,E,L,V,E -> E repeated? And V? But H, L, V? And E at 2 and 5? So ""HELVE"" is H(1),E(2),L(3),V(4),E(5). We are testing H, L, V? And E at position 5? But we are using E twice? So only three new letters? But we have to.\n\n""HEVEA"": H,E,V,E,A -> A excluded? Invalid.\n\n""HEXAD"": H,E,X,A,D -> A and D excluded? Invalid.\n\n""HEXED"": H,E,X,E,D -> D excluded? Invalid.\n\n""HEXER"": H,E,X,E,R -> R excluded? Invalid.\n\n""HEXYL"": H,E,X,Y,L -> H, X, Y, L? And E at 2? So ""HEXYL"" is a word? In chemistry? Valid? Yes. So H(1),E(2),X(3),Y(4),L(5). This uses H, X, Y, L? All new letters? And no repeats? Perfect? We are testing four new letters: H, X, Y, L.\n\nAnd it doesn\'t repeat E? So we get maximum information.\n\nIs ""HEXYL"" a valid word? Yes, it is a chemical term for a radical.\n\nSo we can use ""HEXYL"".\n\nAnother option: ""JEWEL"" we thought earlier? J,E,W,E,L -> but E repeated? And W, L? But ""HEXYL"" has no repeat and four new letters? Better.\n\n""KEXES"": K,E,X,E,S -> S excluded? Invalid.\n\n""LEVEE"": L,E,V,E,E -> E repeated? And V? But L and V? And we know E at 2? So not as good.\n\n""PEWIT"": has I? Invalid.\n\n""VEXED"": V,E,X,E,D -> D excluded? Invalid.\n\n""WEXED"": not common? And D? Invalid.\n\n""YELMS"": Y,E,L,M,S -> M and S excluded?

We have the feedback from four guesses:

1. ""roast"" -> R, O, A, S, T are all absent (x)
2. ""medic"" -> M, D, I, C are absent (x), and E is correct and in the right position (position 2, ✓)
3. ""begun"" -> B, G, U, N are absent (x), and E is again confirmed in position 2 (✓)
4. ""hexyl"" -> H, X, Y are absent (x), E is correct in position 2 (✓), and L is correct and in the right position (position 5, ✓)

So, from the feedback:

- The secret word has the second letter E and the fifth letter L.
- The secret word does not contain: R, O, A, S, T, M, D, I, C, B, G, U, N, H, X, Y.

Additionally, from ""hexyl"", we know that L is in the fifth position and is correct.

So the secret word pattern is: _ E _ _ L

And the excluded letters are: R, O, A, S, T, M, D, I, C, B, G, U, N, H, X, Y.

Now, what letters are left? The alphabet minus the excluded ones.

Excluded: A, B, C, D, G, H, I, M, N, O, R, S, T, U, X, Y.

So available letters: F, J, K, P, Q, V, W, Z.

But note: we have three positions to fill: first, third, and fourth.

The word is: [1] E [3] [4] L

We need to form a 5-letter word with the available letters: F, J, K, P, Q, V, W, Z.

Also, note that the word must be a valid English word.

Let's try to find words that fit this pattern.

Possible words:

- We need a word of the form ? E ? ? L

With the middle two letters (positions 3 and 4) being from F, J, K, P, Q, V, W, Z, and the first letter also from that set.

But note: we have only 8 letters available, and we need to use three of them (one for first, one for third, one for fourth) without repetition? Not necessarily, but since we don't know about repetition, we can try without repetition first.

List of available letters: F, J, K, P, Q, V, W, Z.

Now, common words? Let's think:

- ""JEWEL"": But we have E and L, but J is available? But ""JEWEL"" is J,E,W,E,L -> but position 4 is E? And we have E at position 2? Also, W is available. But the pattern is ? E ? ? L, so for ""JEWEL"": 
  Position 1: J, Position 2: E, Position 3: W, Position 4: E, Position 5: L.
  But position 4 is E? And we know position 2 is E? So it has two E's? But is that allowed? Yes, but we don't know if the secret word has two E's. Also, in the available letters, E is not excluded? But we are allowed to use E? However, in the feedback so far, we only know about one E (at position 2). But in ""hexyl"", we didn't test E elsewhere? So it's possible.

But in ""JEWEL"", we are using E at position 4? That might be a good test? But note: the available letters for positions 3 and 4 should be from F,J,K,P,Q,V,W,Z? E is not in that set? Because E is not excluded, but we are not forced to use only the available set? We can use E? But we know E is in the word? So we can use it again? But in this case, we are trying to fill the positions with letters that might be in the word? But we have limited information.

Actually, we can use any letter that hasn't been excluded? But E is not excluded? We only know it's in position 2? It could be elsewhere? So we can use E in other positions? But in our available set, we didn't include E because we are focusing on new letters? But technically, E is still available to use? However, to maximize information, we might want to avoid reusing known letters? But in this case, we have to form a word? And we have few options.

But let's see: the available letters for new information are F,J,K,P,Q,V,W,Z? But E is known, so we can use it? But if we use E, we might not get new information? Unless we are testing if it appears again.

But in this pattern, we have to have a word that ends with L and has E at position 2? So let's list possible words.

Another word: ""LEVEL"": But L is at position 1 and 5? But we know position 5 is L? And position 2 is E? But ""LEVEL"" has E at position 2 and 4? And L at 1,3,5? But position 3 is V? But V is available? But let's see: 
  Position 1: L -> but we don't know if L is at position 1? And we have to use available letters? But L is not in the available set? Because L is now known to be in the word? But we are not excluding L? We can use it? But we know L is at position 5? So if we put L at position 1, it might be correct or not? But in ""hexyl"", we only tested L at position 5? So we don't know about other positions? But in ""hexyl"", L was at position 5 and correct? But we don't know if L is at other positions? So we can test? But we have to form a word.

However, in ""LEVEL"", position 1 is L? And we have available letters? But L is not in the set {F,J,K,P,Q,V,W,Z}? Because we derived the available set as the letters not excluded? But L is not excluded? We only know it's in the word at position 5? So L is still available to use? But we are trying to test new letters? So it might be better to avoid L? Because we already know it's in the word? But we don't know if it appears twice? So we can test? But with few letters left, we might not need to.

But let's clarify: the excluded letters are only those marked (x) in feedback? So L is not excluded? We can use it? But we are trying to find the secret word? We know position 5 is L? So we don't need to test position 5? But for other positions, we can use L? But it might be inefficient? Because if we use L at position 1, and it's not in the word at position 1, we get feedback? But we have to form a valid word? So if necessary, we can.

But in this case, with the available letters F,J,K,P,Q,V,W,Z, we don't have L? So we cannot use L in positions 1,3,4? Because L is not in the available set? The available set is the letters that haven't been excluded? And L is not excluded? So we can use L? But we are focusing on the letters that are still possible for being in the word? But we know L is in the word? So it's not necessary to test it again? But we can use it to form words? However, to maximize information, we should use letters that we haven't tested? Which are F,J,K,P,Q,V,W,Z? And avoid E and L? Because we already know about them? But E and L are in the word? So we can use them? But if we use them, we might not get new information? For example, if we use E at position 4, we can find out if it's there? Similarly for L.

But let's try to find words that use only F,J,K,P,Q,V,W,Z for positions 1,3,4? And E at 2, L at 5? But that might be hard? Because we need a vowel? The only vowel we have is E? And we are using it at position 2? But positions 3 and 4 are consonants? So the word must be composed of consonants except for E? And L? But L is consonant? So positions 1,3,4 must be consonants? And we have F,J,K,P,Q,V,W,Z? All consonants? So it's possible? But we need a valid word.

For example:
- ""JEWEL"": But position 4 is E? Not a consonant? And E is not in the available set? But we can use it? But let's see: if we use ""JEWEL"", then position 3 is W? Which is available? Position 4 is E? Which is known? But we are testing if E is at position 4? And position 1 is J? Available.

But ""JEWEL"" has two E's? And we are using E at position 4? That might be acceptable? But we are not using a new letter for position 4? We are using E? Which we already know? So we lose the chance to test a new letter? But we have to form a word? And we have few options.

Another word: ""KEVEL"": K,E,V,E,L -> but position 4 is E? Again.

""PEWEL"": Not a word.

""VOWEL"": V,O,W,E,L -> O excluded? Invalid.

""JOWEL"": J,O,W,E,L -> O excluded.

""FEWEL"": Not a word.

""HEWEL"": H excluded.

Perhaps words without E in the middle? 

For example, ""JETEL"": Not a word.

""KEXEL"": Not a word.

""PEWEL"": Not a word.

""QUEL"": Not 5 letters.

""QUELL"": Q,U,E,L,L -> U excluded? And two L's? But U excluded.

""BEVEL"": B excluded and E at 4.

This is difficult.

Another idea: perhaps the word is ""JUMPS"" but U and S excluded.

We need to consider that the secret word might have repeated letters? But we don't know.

Perhaps we can use a word that has E at 2, L at 5, and in between, use two of the available letters.

For example, ""JEP L"" not a word.

""KEPL"": not 5.

""REPEL"": R and E at 4? R excluded.

""SEPAL"": S and A excluded.

""TEPAL"": T and A excluded.

""VEGEL"": V,E,G,E,L -> G excluded.

""WEF L"" not a word.

""ZEXEL"": Not a word.

Perhaps ""FJELD"": F,J,E,L,D -> D excluded.

I am considering using a word that has Y? But Y is excluded? From ""hexyl"": Y(x) -> absent? So we cannot use Y.

Similarly, all the excluded letters are out.

Another common word: ""LEVEL"" but we have L at position 1 and 3? And E at 2 and 4? But position 5 is L? So ""LEVEL"" is L,E,V,E,L.

But V is available? So if we guess ""LEVEL"", then:
- Position 1: L -> we don't know if L is at position 1? But we know L is at position 5? So if we guess L at position 1, it might be correct or not? And position 3: V? Available? Position 4: E? We don't know.

But ""LEVEL"" uses L at position 1 and 3? And E at 4? So we are testing V? And also testing if L is at position 1 and 3? And if E is at position 4? But we have only one new letter: V? Because L and E are known? But we are testing their positions? So it might be acceptable? But we have other options?

But with the available letters, we can try ""VELL"": not 5.

Perhaps ""PELL"": not 5.

Let's list all possible words that fit the pattern ? E ? ? L and use only the available letters or known letters.

But known letters are E and L? And available new letters are F,J,K,P,Q,V,W,Z.

So the word must be composed of letters from {E, L, F, J, K, P, Q, V, W, Z}? But E and L are already in the word? So we can use them? But we are trying to find the secret word? We know E at 2 and L at 5? So positions 1,3,4 should be from F,J,K,P,Q,V,W,Z? Or possibly E or L? But if we use E or L, we are not testing new letters? So ideally, we use new letters.

But is there any word that has E at 2, L at 5, and positions 1,3,4 from F,J,K,P,Q,V,W,Z?

For example:
- ""J E P L L"" -> not a word.
- ""J E K L L"" -> not a word.
- ""J E W L L"" -> not a word.
- ""F E J L L"" -> not a word.
- ""F E K L L"" -> not a word.
- ""F E P L L"" -> not a word.
- ""F E V L L"" -> not a word.
- ""F E W L L"" -> not a word.
- ""F E Z L L"" -> not a word.
- ""K E J L L"" -> not a word.
- ""K E F L L"" -> not a word.
- ""K E P L L"" -> not a word.
- ""K E V L L"" -> not a word.
- ""K E W L L"" -> not a word.
- ""K E Z L L"" -> not a word.
- ""P E J L L"" -> not a word.
- ""P E F L L"" -> not a word.
- ""P E K L L"" -> not a word.
- ""P E V L L"" -> not a word.
- ""P E W L L"" -> not a word.
- ""P E Z L L"" -> not a word.
- ""Q E F L L"" -> not a word.
- ""Q E J L L"" -> not a word.
- ""Q E K L L"" -> not a word.
- ""Q E P L L"" -> not a word.
- ""Q E V L L"" -> not a word.
- ""Q E W L L"" -> not a word.
- ""Q E Z L L"" -> not a word.
- ""V E F L L"" -> not a word.
- ""V E J L L"" -> not a word.
- ""V E K L L"" -> not a word.
- ""V E P L L"" -> not a word.
- ""V E W L L"" -> not a word.
- ""V E Z L L"" -> not a word.
- ""W E F L L"" -> not a word.
- ""W E J L L"" -> not a word.
- ""W E K L L"" -> not a word.
- ""W E P L L"" -> not a word.
- ""W E V L L"" -> not a word.
- ""W E Z L L"" -> not a word.
- ""Z E F L L"" -> not a word.
- ""Z E J L L"" -> not a word.
- ""Z E K L L"" -> not a word.
- ""Z E P L L"" -> not a word.
- ""Z E V L L"" -> not a word.
- ""Z E W L L"" -> not a word.

None of these are words? Because they have two L's at the end? That's not typical.

Perhaps with one L? But we have L at position 5? So position 4 is not L? So we need a letter at position 4.

Another idea: perhaps the word has only one L? And we use different letters.

For example, ""J E W E L"" -> ""jewel"" which is a word? But position 4 is E? So we are using E at position 4? And W at position 3? And J at position 1? And L at position 5? And E at position 2.

So ""JEWEL"" is a valid word? Yes.

And it uses J and W? Which are available? And E at position 4? Which is known? But we are testing if E is at position 4? And also testing J and W.

Similarly, ""V E X E L"" -> but X excluded? From ""hexyl"": X(x) -> absent? So we cannot use X.

""K E Y E L"" -> Y excluded.

""F E E B L"" -> B excluded.

So ""JEWEL"" seems to be a candidate.

Another word: ""P E E L"" -> not 5 letters.

""PEELS"" -> S excluded.

""KEELS"" -> S excluded.

""VEELS"" -> S excluded and E at 4.

""J E V E L"" -> ""JEVEL"" not a word.

""J E P L E"" -> not L at position 5.

We need L at position 5.

So ""JEWEL"" is one option.

Another: ""F E L L"" -> not 5.

""K E L L"" -> not 5.

""P E L L"" -> not 5.

""V E L L"" -> not 5.

""W E L L"" -> not 5.

""Z E L L"" -> not 5.

""J E L L"" -> not 5.

So perhaps ""JEWEL"" is the only common word that fits? Or are there others?

""HEWEL"" not a word.

""NEWEL"": N excluded.

""MEWEL"": M excluded.

""TEWEL"": T excluded.

""DEWEL"": D excluded.

""REWEL"": R excluded.

So ""JEWEL"" seems to be the best bet.

But in ""JEWEL"", we are using E at position 4? Which is not a new letter? But we are testing if it is in the word at that position? And we are testing J and W? Which are new.

Also, from the available letters, we have to use some of them.

So let's go with ""JEWEL"".

But we have to make sure that J and W are not excluded? They are not in the excluded list.

Excluded: A,B,C,D,G,H,I,M,N,O,R,S,T,U,X,Y

So J and W are available.

So guess ""jewel"".

But in the feedback for ""hexyl"", we have L at position 5 correct? So in ""jewel"", position 5 is L? Which is correct? Position 2 is E? Correct? Position 1: J, position 3: W, position 4: E.

So we will get feedback on J, W, and E at position 4.

If the secret word has E at position 4, we get a ✓ for that? Otherwise, if E is not at position 4, we get a - or x? But since E is in the word, if it's not at position 4, it would be marked with - (present but wrong position)? But we already have E at position 2? So if there is only one E, then position 4 would be x? But if there is another E, it would be - or ✓? But we don't know.

But anyway, it's a valid guess.

Perhaps there is a word like ""F E C K L"" but C excluded.

I think ""JEWEL"" is the best we can do.

So I'll go with that.

<guess>jewel</guess>

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""roast""** → All letters (R, O, A, S, T) are **absent** from the secret word.  
- **Guess 2: ""medic""** → Only **E** is **correct and in position 2**. Letters M, D, I, C are **absent**.  
- **Guess 3: ""begun""** → Only **E** is **correct and in position 2** (reaffirmed). Letters B, G, U, N are **absent**.  
- **Guess 4: ""hexyl""** → **E** is **correct in position 2**, **L** is **correct in position 5**, and H, X, Y are **absent**.  

### Key Insights:
1. **Secret word structure**:  
   - Position 2 is **E** (confirmed).  
   - Position 5 is **L** (confirmed).  
   - Format: `_ E _ _ L`  
2. **Excluded letters (16 total)**:  
   - R, O, A, S, T (from Guess 1).  
   - M, D, I, C (from Guess 2).  
   - B, G, U, N (from Guess 3).  
   - H, X, Y (from Guess 4).  
3. **Available letters (10 remaining)**: F, J, K, P, Q, V, W, Z.  
4. **Constraints**:  
   - The word must start with a letter from the available set (F, J, K, P, Q, V, W, Z).  
   - Positions 3 and 4 must also use letters from the available set or known letters (E, L), but E and L are already confirmed at positions 2 and 5.  
   - The word must be a valid English word.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Prioritize words** that:  
  - Fit the `_ E _ _ L` structure.  
  - Use **new letters** from the available pool (F, J, K, P, Q, V, W, Z) to maximize information gain.  
  - Avoid reused letters to test untested positions.  
- **Optimal candidate**: ""JEWEL"" (valid 5-letter word).  
  - **Structure**: J (position 1), E (position 2, fixed), W (position 3), E (position 4), L (position 5, fixed).  
  - **Why ""JEWEL""?**  
    - Tests **J and W** (new high-value letters from the available pool).  
    - Tests if **E appears again** at position 4 (possible given English word patterns).  
    - Real word (common noun, meaning a precious stone).  
- If ""JEWEL"" is incorrect, feedback on J, W, and E at position 4 will significantly narrow possibilities (e.g., revealing if E is repeated or if J/W are present).

<guess>jewel</guess>",jewel,"We have the feedback from four guesses:

1. ""roast"" -> R, O, A, S, T are all absent (x)
2. ""medic"" -> M, D, I, C are absent (x), and E is correct and in the right position (position 2, ✓)
3. ""begun"" -> B, G, U, N are absent (x), and E is again confirmed in position 2 (✓)
4. ""hexyl"" -> H, X, Y are absent (x), E is correct in position 2 (✓), and L is correct and in the right position (position 5, ✓)

So, from the feedback:

- The secret word has the second letter E and the fifth letter L.
- The secret word does not contain: R, O, A, S, T, M, D, I, C, B, G, U, N, H, X, Y.

Additionally, from ""hexyl"", we know that L is in the fifth position and is correct.

So the secret word pattern is: _ E _ _ L

And the excluded letters are: R, O, A, S, T, M, D, I, C, B, G, U, N, H, X, Y.

Now, what letters are left? The alphabet minus the excluded ones.

Excluded: A, B, C, D, G, H, I, M, N, O, R, S, T, U, X, Y.

So available letters: F, J, K, P, Q, V, W, Z.

But note: we have three positions to fill: first, third, and fourth.

The word is: [1] E [3] [4] L

We need to form a 5-letter word with the available letters: F, J, K, P, Q, V, W, Z.

Also, note that the word must be a valid English word.

Let's try to find words that fit this pattern.

Possible words:

- We need a word of the form ? E ? ? L

With the middle two letters (positions 3 and 4) being from F, J, K, P, Q, V, W, Z, and the first letter also from that set.

But note: we have only 8 letters available, and we need to use three of them (one for first, one for third, one for fourth) without repetition? Not necessarily, but since we don't know about repetition, we can try without repetition first.

List of available letters: F, J, K, P, Q, V, W, Z.

Now, common words? Let's think:

- ""JEWEL"": But we have E and L, but J is available? But ""JEWEL"" is J,E,W,E,L -> but position 4 is E? And we have E at position 2? Also, W is available. But the pattern is ? E ? ? L, so for ""JEWEL"": 
  Position 1: J, Position 2: E, Position 3: W, Position 4: E, Position 5: L.
  But position 4 is E? And we know position 2 is E? So it has two E's? But is that allowed? Yes, but we don't know if the secret word has two E's. Also, in the available letters, E is not excluded? But we are allowed to use E? However, in the feedback so far, we only know about one E (at position 2). But in ""hexyl"", we didn't test E elsewhere? So it's possible.

But in ""JEWEL"", we are using E at position 4? That might be a good test? But note: the available letters for positions 3 and 4 should be from F,J,K,P,Q,V,W,Z? E is not in that set? Because E is not excluded, but we are not forced to use only the available set? We can use E? But we know E is in the word? So we can use it again? But in this case, we are trying to fill the positions with letters that might be in the word? But we have limited information.

Actually, we can use any letter that hasn't been excluded? But E is not excluded? We only know it's in position 2? It could be elsewhere? So we can use E in other positions? But in our available set, we didn't include E because we are focusing on new letters? But technically, E is still available to use? However, to maximize information, we might want to avoid reusing known letters? But in this case, we have to form a word? And we have few options.

But let's see: the available letters for new information are F,J,K,P,Q,V,W,Z? But E is known, so we can use it? But if we use E, we might not get new information? Unless we are testing if it appears again.

But in this pattern, we have to have a word that ends with L and has E at position 2? So let's list possible words.

Another word: ""LEVEL"": But L is at position 1 and 5? But we know position 5 is L? And position 2 is E? But ""LEVEL"" has E at position 2 and 4? And L at 1,3,5? But position 3 is V? But V is available? But let's see: 
  Position 1: L -> but we don't know if L is at position 1? And we have to use available letters? But L is not in the available set? Because L is now known to be in the word? But we are not excluding L? We can use it? But we know L is at position 5? So if we put L at position 1, it might be correct or not? But in ""hexyl"", we only tested L at position 5? So we don't know about other positions? But in ""hexyl"", L was at position 5 and correct? But we don't know if L is at other positions? So we can test? But we have to form a word.

However, in ""LEVEL"", position 1 is L? And we have available letters? But L is not in the set {F,J,K,P,Q,V,W,Z}? Because we derived the available set as the letters not excluded? But L is not excluded? We only know it's in the word at position 5? So L is still available to use? But we are trying to test new letters? So it might be better to avoid L? Because we already know it's in the word? But we don't know if it appears twice? So we can test? But with few letters left, we might not need to.

But let's clarify: the excluded letters are only those marked (x) in feedback? So L is not excluded? We can use it? But we are trying to find the secret word? We know position 5 is L? So we don't need to test position 5? But for other positions, we can use L? But it might be inefficient? Because if we use L at position 1, and it's not in the word at position 1, we get feedback? But we have to form a valid word? So if necessary, we can.

But in this case, with the available letters F,J,K,P,Q,V,W,Z, we don't have L? So we cannot use L in positions 1,3,4? Because L is not in the available set? The available set is the letters that haven't been excluded? And L is not excluded? So we can use L? But we are focusing on the letters that are still possible for being in the word? But we know L is in the word? So it's not necessary to test it again? But we can use it to form words? However, to maximize information, we should use letters that we haven't tested? Which are F,J,K,P,Q,V,W,Z? And avoid E and L? Because we already know about them? But E and L are in the word? So we can use them? But if we use them, we might not get new information? For example, if we use E at position 4, we can find out if it's there? Similarly for L.

But let's try to find words that use only F,J,K,P,Q,V,W,Z for positions 1,3,4? And E at 2, L at 5? But that might be hard? Because we need a vowel? The only vowel we have is E? And we are using it at position 2? But positions 3 and 4 are consonants? So the word must be composed of consonants except for E? And L? But L is consonant? So positions 1,3,4 must be consonants? And we have F,J,K,P,Q,V,W,Z? All consonants? So it's possible? But we need a valid word.

For example:
- ""JEWEL"": But position 4 is E? Not a consonant? And E is not in the available set? But we can use it? But let's see: if we use ""JEWEL"", then position 3 is W? Which is available? Position 4 is E? Which is known? But we are testing if E is at position 4? And position 1 is J? Available.

But ""JEWEL"" has two E's? And we are using E at position 4? That might be acceptable? But we are not using a new letter for position 4? We are using E? Which we already know? So we lose the chance to test a new letter? But we have to form a word? And we have few options.

Another word: ""KEVEL"": K,E,V,E,L -> but position 4 is E? Again.

""PEWEL"": Not a word.

""VOWEL"": V,O,W,E,L -> O excluded? Invalid.

""JOWEL"": J,O,W,E,L -> O excluded.

""FEWEL"": Not a word.

""HEWEL"": H excluded.

Perhaps words without E in the middle? 

For example, ""JETEL"": Not a word.

""KEXEL"": Not a word.

""PEWEL"": Not a word.

""QUEL"": Not 5 letters.

""QUELL"": Q,U,E,L,L -> U excluded? And two L's? But U excluded.

""BEVEL"": B excluded and E at 4.

This is difficult.

Another idea: perhaps the word is ""JUMPS"" but U and S excluded.

We need to consider that the secret word might have repeated letters? But we don't know.

Perhaps we can use a word that has E at 2, L at 5, and in between, use two of the available letters.

For example, ""JEP L"" not a word.

""KEPL"": not 5.

""REPEL"": R and E at 4? R excluded.

""SEPAL"": S and A excluded.

""TEPAL"": T and A excluded.

""VEGEL"": V,E,G,E,L -> G excluded.

""WEF L"" not a word.

""ZEXEL"": Not a word.

Perhaps ""FJELD"": F,J,E,L,D -> D excluded.

I am considering using a word that has Y? But Y is excluded? From ""hexyl"": Y(x) -> absent? So we cannot use Y.

Similarly, all the excluded letters are out.

Another common word: ""LEVEL"" but we have L at position 1 and 3? And E at 2 and 4? But position 5 is L? So ""LEVEL"" is L,E,V,E,L.

But V is available? So if we guess ""LEVEL"", then:
- Position 1: L -> we don't know if L is at position 1? But we know L is at position 5? So if we guess L at position 1, it might be correct or not? And position 3: V? Available? Position 4: E? We don't know.

But ""LEVEL"" uses L at position 1 and 3? And E at 4? So we are testing V? And also testing if L is at position 1 and 3? And if E is at position 4? But we have only one new letter: V? Because L and E are known? But we are testing their positions? So it might be acceptable? But we have other options?

But with the available letters, we can try ""VELL"": not 5.

Perhaps ""PELL"": not 5.

Let's list all possible words that fit the pattern ? E ? ? L and use only the available letters or known letters.

But known letters are E and L? And available new letters are F,J,K,P,Q,V,W,Z.

So the word must be composed of letters from {E, L, F, J, K, P, Q, V, W, Z}? But E and L are already in the word? So we can use them? But we are trying to find the secret word? We know E at 2 and L at 5? So positions 1,3,4 should be from F,J,K,P,Q,V,W,Z? Or possibly E or L? But if we use E or L, we are not testing new letters? So ideally, we use new letters.

But is there any word that has E at 2, L at 5, and positions 1,3,4 from F,J,K,P,Q,V,W,Z?

For example:
- ""J E P L L"" -> not a word.
- ""J E K L L"" -> not a word.
- ""J E W L L"" -> not a word.
- ""F E J L L"" -> not a word.
- ""F E K L L"" -> not a word.
- ""F E P L L"" -> not a word.
- ""F E V L L"" -> not a word.
- ""F E W L L"" -> not a word.
- ""F E Z L L"" -> not a word.
- ""K E J L L"" -> not a word.
- ""K E F L L"" -> not a word.
- ""K E P L L"" -> not a word.
- ""K E V L L"" -> not a word.
- ""K E W L L"" -> not a word.
- ""K E Z L L"" -> not a word.
- ""P E J L L"" -> not a word.
- ""P E F L L"" -> not a word.
- ""P E K L L"" -> not a word.
- ""P E V L L"" -> not a word.
- ""P E W L L"" -> not a word.
- ""P E Z L L"" -> not a word.
- ""Q E F L L"" -> not a word.
- ""Q E J L L"" -> not a word.
- ""Q E K L L"" -> not a word.
- ""Q E P L L"" -> not a word.
- ""Q E V L L"" -> not a word.
- ""Q E W L L"" -> not a word.
- ""Q E Z L L"" -> not a word.
- ""V E F L L"" -> not a word.
- ""V E J L L"" -> not a word.
- ""V E K L L"" -> not a word.
- ""V E P L L"" -> not a word.
- ""V E W L L"" -> not a word.
- ""V E Z L L"" -> not a word.
- ""W E F L L"" -> not a word.
- ""W E J L L"" -> not a word.
- ""W E K L L"" -> not a word.
- ""W E P L L"" -> not a word.
- ""W E V L L"" -> not a word.
- ""W E Z L L"" -> not a word.
- ""Z E F L L"" -> not a word.
- ""Z E J L L"" -> not a word.
- ""Z E K L L"" -> not a word.
- ""Z E P L L"" -> not a word.
- ""Z E V L L"" -> not a word.
- ""Z E W L L"" -> not a word.

None of these are words? Because they have two L's at the end? That's not typical.

Perhaps with one L? But we have L at position 5? So position 4 is not L? So we need a letter at position 4.

Another idea: perhaps the word has only one L? And we use different letters.

For example, ""J E W E L"" -> ""jewel"" which is a word? But position 4 is E? So we are using E at position 4? And W at position 3? And J at position 1? And L at position 5? And E at position 2.

So ""JEWEL"" is a valid word? Yes.

And it uses J and W? Which are available? And E at position 4? Which is known? But we are testing if E is at position 4? And also testing J and W.

Similarly, ""V E X E L"" -> but X excluded? From ""hexyl"": X(x) -> absent? So we cannot use X.

""K E Y E L"" -> Y excluded.

""F E E B L"" -> B excluded.

So ""JEWEL"" seems to be a candidate.

Another word: ""P E E L"" -> not 5 letters.

""PEELS"" -> S excluded.

""KEELS"" -> S excluded.

""VEELS"" -> S excluded and E at 4.

""J E V E L"" -> ""JEVEL"" not a word.

""J E P L E"" -> not L at position 5.

We need L at position 5.

So ""JEWEL"" is one option.

Another: ""F E L L"" -> not 5.

""K E L L"" -> not 5.

""P E L L"" -> not 5.

""V E L L"" -> not 5.

""W E L L"" -> not 5.

""Z E L L"" -> not 5.

""J E L L"" -> not 5.

So perhaps ""JEWEL"" is the only common word that fits? Or are there others?

""HEWEL"" not a word.

""NEWEL"": N excluded.

""MEWEL"": M excluded.

""TEWEL"": T excluded.

""DEWEL"": D excluded.

""REWEL"": R excluded.

So ""JEWEL"" seems to be the best bet.

But in ""JEWEL"", we are using E at position 4? Which is not a new letter? But we are testing if it is in the word at that position? And we are testing J and W? Which are new.

Also, from the available letters, we have to use some of them.

So let's go with ""JEWEL"".

But we have to make sure that J and W are not excluded? They are not in the excluded list.

Excluded: A,B,C,D,G,H,I,M,N,O,R,S,T,U,X,Y

So J and W are available.

So guess ""jewel"".

But in the feedback for ""hexyl"", we have L at position 5 correct? So in ""jewel"", position 5 is L? Which is correct? Position 2 is E? Correct? Position 1: J, position 3: W, position 4: E.

So we will get feedback on J, W, and E at position 4.

If the secret word has E at position 4, we get a ✓ for that? Otherwise, if E is not at position 4, we get a - or x? But since E is in the word, if it's not at position 4, it would be marked with - (present but wrong position)? But we already have E at position 2? So if there is only one E, then position 4 would be x? But if there is another E, it would be - or ✓? But we don't know.

But anyway, it's a valid guess.

Perhaps there is a word like ""F E C K L"" but C excluded.

I think ""JEWEL"" is the best we can do.

So I'll go with that.

<guess>jewel</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""roast""** → All letters (R, O, A, S, T) are **absent** from the secret word.  
- **Guess 2: ""medic""** → Only **E** is **correct and in position 2**. Letters M, D, I, C are **absent**.  
- **Guess 3: ""begun""** → Only **E** is **correct and in position 2** (reaffirmed). Letters B, G, U, N are **absent**.  
- **Guess 4: ""hexyl""** → **E** is **correct in position 2**, **L** is **correct in position 5**, and H, X, Y are **absent**.  

### Key Insights:
1. **Secret word structure**:  
   - Position 2 is **E** (confirmed).  
   - Position 5 is **L** (confirmed).  
   - Format: `_ E _ _ L`  
2. **Excluded letters (16 total)**:  
   - R, O, A, S, T (from Guess 1).  
   - M, D, I, C (from Guess 2).  
   - B, G, U, N (from Guess 3).  
   - H, X, Y (from Guess 4).  
3. **Available letters (10 remaining)**: F, J, K, P, Q, V, W, Z.  
4. **Constraints**:  
   - The word must start with a letter from the available set (F, J, K, P, Q, V, W, Z).  
   - Positions 3 and 4 must also use letters from the available set or known letters (E, L), but E and L are already confirmed at positions 2 and 5.  
   - The word must be a valid English word.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Prioritize words** that:  
  - Fit the `_ E _ _ L` structure.  
  - Use **new letters** from the available pool (F, J, K, P, Q, V, W, Z) to maximize information gain.  
  - Avoid reused letters to test untested positions.  
- **Optimal candidate**: ""JEWEL"" (valid 5-letter word).  
  - **Structure**: J (position 1), E (position 2, fixed), W (position 3), E (position 4), L (position 5, fixed).  
  - **Why ""JEWEL""?**  
    - Tests **J and W** (new high-value letters from the available pool).  
    - Tests if **E appears again** at position 4 (possible given English word patterns).  
    - Real word (common noun, meaning a precious stone).  
- If ""JEWEL"" is incorrect, feedback on J, W, and E at position 4 will significantly narrow possibilities (e.g., revealing if E is repeated or if J/W are present).",Guess 5: jewel -> FEEDBACK: J(x) E(✓) W(x) E(✓) L(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has three vowels and two common consonants. I'll go with ""ROAST"".

 R, O, A, S, T are all common letters. This might give us good information.

 So, my first guess is ""ROAST"".

<guess>roast</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: roast -> FEEDBACK: R(x) O(x) A(x) S(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for our first guess ""roast"": R(x) O(x) A(x) S(x) T(x)
 This means that none of the letters R, O, A, S, T are in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, we must avoid using any of these letters in our next guess.

 Considering that, we need to choose a word that uses different letters. We should pick common letters that haven't been tried.

 The remaining vowels are E, I, U (since A and O are out). Consonants: we have many left like B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Since we have no correct letters, we want to maximize new information. So we should include more common vowels and consonants.

 Common letters in English: E, I, L, N, U, etc. We can also consider words with repeated letters? But typically for second guess we avoid repeats since we have 5-letter unique words? Actually, Wordle allows repeated letters but in this case, since we haven't seen any, maybe we avoid for now.

 A good candidate might be ""CLINE"". However, C and L are common. Alternatively, ""DEUCE"" has two E's and U. But it has E twice? Maybe let's pick a word without repeats.

 Another idea: ""PLUCK"" uses P, L, U, C, K. But U is a vowel? Or we can choose ""NYMPH"" but it has Y (which can be vowel) and is not very common.

 Important: We need to cover as many common letters as possible.

 Common letters remaining: E (most common), then I, L, N, U, D, M, H, C, etc.

 I propose a word that uses E and I (vowels) and three common consonants: L, N, D, H, C, etc.

 Example: ""LINED"" -> L, I, N, E, D. This gives us two vowels (I, E) and three consonants (L, N, D).

 But note: we have already eliminated R,O,A,S,T so we must avoid them.

 Alternatively, ""CHIME"": C, H, I, M, E. This covers E, C, H, I, M.

 Another one: ""LEECH"" but it has repeated E? And H at end. Better to avoid repeats? Yes, because we don't know if there is repetition.

 Let me choose ""CHIME"". It has C, H, I, M, E. All new letters and covers common vowels and consonants.

 But note: there might be a word that covers more frequent letters? E, I are high frequency.

 Alternatively, ""QUERY"" but Q is rare and we have eliminated R? R is already eliminated so we must not use R.

 Another candidate: ""FILCH"" has F, I, L, C, H. F is less common? Maybe skip.

 How about ""MEDIC""? M, E, D, I, C. That's M, E, D, I, C. Also good because it covers E and I.

 Let me choose ""MEDIC"". It uses M, E, D, I, C.

 However, note that ""CHIME"" is also good. I'll go with ""MEDIC"" because D and C are very common.

 Wait, another idea: ""PINEY"", but Y is sometimes vowel and we haven't tested Y? But we are avoiding R,O,A,S,T so P,I,N,E,Y. But Y is the last letter and might be less common? Actually, Y is common in words as a vowel.

 But let me stick to ""MEDIC"".

 Alternatively, ""ELUDE""? E, L, U, D, E. Wait, repeated E? Not allowed? The rules don't say repeated letters are disallowed, but in the guess we can have repeated letters? However, the word must be valid. But for efficiency, we might want to avoid repeats to cover more letters.

 Since we didn't get any positive feedback, we want to test as many new letters as possible. Therefore, we should avoid repeating letters in this guess?

 Absolutely. So ""ELUDE"" has two E's so it's not ideal. Similarly, ""LEECH"" is no.

 So ""MEDIC"" is unique letters: M, E, D, I, C.

 Therefore, I choose ""MEDIC"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""roast"" – where none of the letters (R, O, A, S, T) are in the secret word – we need to avoid those letters entirely in our next guess. 

To maximize information, we should test new common vowels and consonants. The word ""**medic**"" incorporates:
- **M, E, D, I, C**: These are high-frequency letters (avoiding the eliminated ones)  
- Covers 2 new vowels (E, I) and 3 new consonants (M, D, C)  
- Helps quickly check if any of these dominant letters appear in the secret word  

This strategic guess narrows possibilities while adhering to the feedback.

<guess>medic</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: roast -> FEEDBACK: R(x) O(x) A(x) S(x) T(x)
Guess 2: medic -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(✓) D(x) I(x) C(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two guesses and their feedback:
1. ""roast"" -> all letters incorrect: R, O, A, S, T are not in the word at all.
2. ""medic"" -> M(x), E(✓), D(x), I(x), C(x). 
   - This means that only E is in the word and it's in the correct position. Specifically, E is the second letter because in ""medic"":
        Position 1: M -> x
        Position 2: E -> ✓ -> so the secret word has E as the second letter.
   - The other letters M, D, I, C are not in the word at all.

Therefore, we know:
- The second letter is E.
- Letters that are definitely not in the word: R, O, A, S, T, M, D, I, C.

Available letters: We can use any letters except those excluded: R,O,A,S,T,M,D,I,C.

We need to form a 5-letter word where:
- The second letter is E.
- The word must not contain any of the excluded letters.

Common letters left: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. And we have vowels: U and Y (since A, E, I, O are used; note E is placed but cannot use I or O or A). But wait E is placed so we have E in the word, but we can use other vowels? Actually, we have to use new letters that aren't excluded.

Vowels available: U (and sometimes Y, W act as vowels). We can use U and Y.

Structure: The word is: ? E ? ? ?

We need to choose a word that uses only remaining letters: 
Available: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to cover common letters to gather more information. Common consonants: H, L, N, P, etc.

Possible guesses:

Let's list some words that fit:
- HAVE: H, A, V, E -> but A is excluded (from first guess). Invalid.
- HAVE is no because A is excluded.

We need words without A, and without the other excluded letters.

Examples:
- JEWEL: J, E, W, E, L -> but second letter is E? Actually: J(1), E(2), W(3), E(4), L(5). So position 2 is E. But note it has E twice. Also, letters: J, W, E, L. E is already known, so we are testing J, W, L. However, E appears again? But we don't know if E repeats. We are allowed to guess repeated letters? The rules don't forbid it, but since E is already known to be in position 2, it might be redundant? Not necessarily, if E appears twice we can get a - or ✓ for the second E? However, currently we only know one E. But if we guess a word with two E's, we can test if there is a second E.

But we need to avoid excluded letters. Checking: J is available, E is allowed (but we know it's in position 2, so position 4 if we put E would be another test), W, L.

But note: E in position 4: if the secret word does not have E in position 4, but has E elsewhere, we might get a - sign? Actually, the feedback would say - if it's somewhere else? But we already have E in position 2 correct. However, we are testing for other letters too.

But let's avoid repeats for now? Because we want to maximize the number of new letters? Since we don't know, maybe keep it simple.

Another word: ""LEECH"" -> L, E, E, C, H -> but C is excluded? C was in the excluded list from guess 2.

No, C is excluded (from ""medic"": C(x)).

So let's avoid using E again if possible? To test more letters.

Options:
- ""FEIGN"" -> F, E, I, G, N -> I is excluded? From guess 2: I(x). So I is excluded? Yes, because I got x.

Excluded letters: R, O, A, S, T, M, D, I, C.

So in ""FEIGN"": I is excluded -> invalid.

- ""NEVER"" -> N, E, V, E, R -> but R is excluded? R was in first guess with x -> invalid.

- ""HELP"" -> H, E, L, P -> only 4 letters? Must be 5 letters.

We need 5-letter words.

Perhaps:
- ""BEVEL"": B, E, V, E, L -> uses E twice? But B, V, L are new.
But E appears at position 2 and position 5? Positions: B(1), E(2), V(3), E(4), L(5). Actually, position 4 would be E? But we are going to have position 2 E known, so we are testing B, V, L at positions 1,3,5 and also testing if position 4 is E? That might be inefficient because if we don't get a second E, it doesn't help as much? But we can try.

However, we are allowed to do so.

Another word: ""FJELD"" -> F, J, E, L, D -> D is excluded? From guess 2, D(x) -> invalid.

Let's find words that only use available letters: B, F, G, H, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z and the vowel U or Y? And not using E again? But E is in a known position so we can skip other E? Or we can use E? Actually, we might want to test for repetition? Since we don't know.

Alternatively, avoid E repetition for more coverage? We have few guesses left.

Another candidate: ""BLEWY"" -> not valid? Let's list:

""BEVY"" is not 5 letters.

Actually: 
- ""LEVEL"" -> L,E,V,E,L -> but L repeated? And position 2 is E -> good? But V is included. However: letters: L, E, V -> but V, L are new? And we test if E is at position 4? And L at beginning and end? But it has two L's and two E's? Also, L and E are being tested? However, we don't know if L is in the word? Actually, the secret word might have L? We haven't tested.

But the excluded letters: we cannot use R,O,A,S,T,M,D,I,C -> LEVEL uses L, E, V -> L and V are allowed.

But: positions:
Position 1: L -> new
Position 2: E -> ✓ (we know)
Position 3: V -> new
Position 4: E -> we don't know? This would test position 4.
Position 5: L -> same as position 1? So if L is in the word? But wait, testing two positions for L? Might be useful.

But the word ""level"" is valid? Well, LEVEL is a word.

Alternatively, let me try ""BLEEP"" -> B, L, E, E, P -> valid? But P is allowed? And E at 3rd and 4th? Actually position 2: we are expecting E -> so we need to have E at position 2? No: the structure we need is any second letter E.

For ""BLEEP"": positions are B(1), L(2), E(3), E(4), P(5) -> but position 2 is L? It must be E? So that guess would be invalid? Because we don't have E in the second position? For our guess, we must have E in the second position? Because we know that the secret word has E as the second letter? So in our guess, we must put E in the second position? Otherwise, we might get a - or x for E? But the feedback for E would be - if it's in another position? But we want to use the known E to keep position 2 correct? Actually, we can change? But it's not necessary? Because if we put E elsewhere and get ✓, we would know? But we only know position 2 has E? So we can try putting E at another position? However, to maximize efficiency, we can perhaps keep position 2 as E? That way we have 4 other positions? Or we can move E to test? But since we don't know if there is another E, we can try.

But it might be better to have position 2 fixed as E to lock that position? Then test other letters? Then we know always one letter is E and in place? So we can focus on the rest.

Given that, let's fix position 2 as E and choose other letters from the available pool.

So guess: [first] E [third] [fourth] [fifth]

Letters: first, third, fourth, fifth must be from {B, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z} excluding already excluded? As above, as long as not in excluded letters.

Common combinations: 
- Words like ""BELOW"" -> but O is excluded? O is excluded? From first guess: O(x) -> invalid.
- ""BEING"" -> I excluded? From guess 2 -> invalid.
- ""HONEY"" -> O excluded? Invalid.
- ""KEYED"" -> E at fourth? Also D excluded -> invalid.

Try ""LENES"" -> L,E,N,E,S -> S excluded? From first guess? S(x) -> invalid.

Another: ""BELLE"" -> B, E, L, L, E -> repeated E and L? And second letter E? Positions: B(1), E(2), L(3), L(4), E(5). Uses B, L, E -> L is new? So we test B and L? But two L's.

Better words?
How about ""UVEA"" -> too short.

Perhaps: ""QUEUE"" -> Q, U, E, U, E -> second position E? No, position 1:Q,2:U, etc -> not E in second?

Need word: _ E _ _ _

Options:
- ""FEIGN"" -> not allowed because I excluded? Yes.
- ""NEIGH"" -> N, E, I, G, H -> I excluded? Invalid.

Without I: 
- ""LEGAL"" -> L,E,G,A -> but A excluded? Invalid.

Available vowels: U and Y.

So words with U or Y in them? Or all consonants?

Example: ""DEUCE"" -> D excluded? Invalid.
- ""YEUKY"" -> not valid word.

""YEXES"" -> but X and S? S excluded.

Common word: ""HONEY"" -> O excluded? No, O is excluded.

Another: ""FLUKE"" -> F, L, U, K, E -> but E at fifth? We have E at position 2 -> so we need E at position 2? But FLUKE has E at position 5? So to avoid having E at all? Or have at position 2? If we use FLUKE, position 2 is L, which we don't know? Then feedback: position 5 E might be ✓ or x? But we know E is in the word? So if we put E at position 5, it might get ✓ if it is indeed there? But we also have position 2? We don't know position 2? We do know position 2 is E? So it's better to use a word that has E at position 2? To keep that spot? Otherwise, we lose a chance? Or get more info?

Let me clarify: the secret word has E in position 2? So if we guess a word without E at position 2, then E (if at position 5) might get marked with - or ✓? If at position 5, ✓ would mean the secret has E at position 5? But we already know E at position 2? So the word could have two E's? Or if we don't have E at position 2, then we'd get feedback that position 2 is not E? But it is E in the secret? So that would be wasteful? Because we already know it's E? So we always want E at position 2? To lock that? Then we don't have to retest? And we focus on the other letters? Yes.

Therefore, we stick with having E in position 2? So the guess must have the second letter E? Then we can concentrate on discovering the other letters? So all guesses going forward should have E in position 2? Until we know more? Or we have the full word.

So: guess pattern: [letter] E [letter] [letter] [letter]

We need to pick word of the form X E Y Z W.

Available letters: all except excluded: R,O,A,S,T,M,D,I,C.

So available: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,N,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

We also have to avoid using excluded letters? And we want to cover common letters to narrow down.

Let me list possible words:
- ""BELOW"": includes O -> excluded? O is excluded -> no.
- ""BENCH"": C excluded? C from ""medic"" got x -> excluded? So invalid.
- ""FENCE"": E? But in addition to position 2? And C excluded? Invalid.
- ""JELLY"": J,E,L,L,Y -> Y at the end? And L repeated. But letters: J,L,Y -> new? So valid? Word.

JELLY: J,E,L,L,Y -> positions: J(1),E(2),(L at 3 and 4), Y(5). But it has two L's? We can do that? The word is acceptable? But we risk that L might be in the word once? But if it isn't, we duplicate? Or we can get feedback.

Another: ""LEVEL"" -> L,E,V,E,L -> but E at 4? Will be tested? And V? Levels? Valid? But E is at 2 and 4? Which we already know for position 2? So we can test if E is at position 4? And V and L? But we have two L's? Might be inefficient? Especially since we have limited guesses.

Better to pick a word with entirely new letters? Covering as many new common letters as possible.

Available: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,N,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Common letters: L, H, N, P, U, B, etc.

How about ""BLUEY""? Not valid? ""BLEAK"" -> A excluded? Invalid.

""PLUME"": P,L,U,M,E -> M excluded? From ""medic"": M(x)? M is excluded? Invalid.

""FUNKY"": F,U,N,K,Y -> all new? And not excluded? F,U,N,K,Y are not excluded. Second letter E needed? ""FUNKY"" is F, U, N, K, Y? Position 2 is U? but we need position 2 to be E? So not this word? Because we want E at position 2? So we cannot just have any word? Must have E at position 2.

Correct form is X E Y Z W.

""FUNKY"" doesn't have E.

What about:
- ""QUEEN"": Q,U,E,E,N -> good? Positions: Q(1), U(2)? U at position 2? We need E at position 2? But ""queen"" has E at position 3 and 4? Not position 2? So wrong pattern? We require the second letter to be E? But ""queen"" has second letter U? So it would be: positions:1:Q,2:U,3:E,4:E,5:N? Then feedback for E? We know secret has E at position 2? So if we guess ""queen"", position 2 U: if U is not in word? x? And E would be marked at position 3 and 4: if at position 3? But secret has E only at position 2? Then position 3 E might be x? Then position 2 U gets x? But we know position 2 is E? So that guess wastes position 2? We might still get U? Or not? The feedback for position 2 U will be ""x"" because the secret has E at position 2? Not U? So position 2: U is not E and U is not in the word? It would get x? Then positions 3 and 4, E would be at? But we know E is only at position 2? But secret might have more E's? If secret has E at position 3 as well? That's possible? But currently we only know position 2 E? So we don't know about others? Therefore, guessing a word without E at position 2 could be useful if we also include E elsewhere? To test for multiple E's? But it may not be efficient with only 6 tries? It's risky? Also, in this case, we would get position 2 U: if we guess ""queen"", feedback might be: position 1 Q? Then U? which will be x because position 2 must be E? Then E at position 3 or 4, if secret has E at position 3, it would be marked as - or ✓? But we don't know if secret has E elsewhere? So we can test? But we have E at position 2 confirmed? And we don't know about other positions? So perhaps we can use other guesses? But since we have 4 tries left? Maybe we stick to having E at position 2? So we can focus on the first, third, fourth, fifth letters? And not test E again? Or only if convenient? But let's focus on the available letters.

A good word: ""PENAL"": P,E,N,A,L -> but A excluded? From the first feedback? A(x) -> invalid.

""NEXUS"": N,E,X,U,S -> S excluded? Invalid.

""BELCH"": B,E,L,C,H -> C excluded? Invalid.

How about ""YEH"" -> not 5 letters.

""WEEDY"": W,E,E,D,Y -> D excluded? D(x) -> invalid.

""VERGE"": V,E,R,G,E -> R excluded? Invalid.

This is difficult.

Let's think of words with common available letters: U, L, N, H, etc.

""EU K something"" but second letter E: so words like:
- ""LEGER"": L,E,G,E,R -> R excluded? Invalid.
- ""HEDGE"": H,E,D,G,E -> D excluded? Invalid.
- ""LEVEL"" we thought earlier? But let's try something without excluded letters.

Available: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,N,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

For example:
- ""FILE"" -> not 5 letters.
- ""FILEK"" -> ""fickle"" -> but ""fickle"" has I? I excluded? Invalid.

""JUKE"": not 5.

""BEGUN"": B,E,G,U,N -> letters: B,G,U,N -> all available? And structure: B(1),E(2),G(3),U(4),N(5) -> so ""begun"" is a word? Yes. B E G U N.

Letters: B,G,U,N are all new and available.

This is good? We haven't used any of these before? And not excluded.

So we can guess ""begun""? And check.

""Begun"" meets all criteria? Position and letters are from available set.

Another candidate: ""HELIX"": H,E,L,I,X -> I excluded? I got x? Invalid.

""VENUE"": V,E,N,U,E -> E at position 2 and 5? And U? Let's see: letters: V,N,U,E -> E is already known? And U? But ""venue"" structure: V(1),E(2),N(3),U(4),E(5). So we are testing V, N, U? And E at position 5? Which is new? But V,N,U are available? And E is known? So valid? But we are using E twice? That might be OK? But it could reveal if there's more than one E? However, we don't have a better choice? Alternatively, ""begun"" avoids doubling E.

Also, ""begun"" tests B,G,U,N? And not E repetition? Better? Since letters are different.

Similarly, ""P G U N something"" -> ""begun"" is one.

""JEG U something"" not common.

""VEGUN"" not a word.

So ""begun"" seems valid: B E G U N.

Alternatively, ""BEVAN"" is not common? ""Bevel"" -> B,E,V,E,L -> has E twice? And L? Available? But E at position 4? And V? Also good.

But ""begun"" covers G and U? Also new.

Another option: ""LEVIN"": L,E,V,I,N -> I excluded? Invalid.

""KELPY"": K,E,L,P,Y -> K,L,P,Y available? Yes? And E at position 2? So ""K E L P Y"" -> positions.

Both ""begun"" and ""kelpy"" are possible? Let's see: ""kelpy"" is a word? Yes, meaning a brown algal.

Which is better? ""begun"" has B,G,U,N? ""kelpy"" has K,L,P,Y? What letters are more common? In English, L is common, P is common, K, Y? U is common vowel? But U is less common than L? L is very common? Perhaps ""kelpy"" covers common letters? U is also common.

But to decide? We have to pick one.

In ""kelpy"" we have Y at the end? Which is also worth testing? But we don't know.

Also, ""begun"" has more vowels? U in position 4? But in the secret word, we know the second letter is E? And we don't know if there are other vowels? U could be there? But consonants? Both options have two vowels? E and U in ""begun""? In ""kelpy"" has E and Y? With Y acting as vowel.

But ""begun"" uses U which is a vowel? And we don't have U tested? So good.

But whichever, both are valid? I choose ""begun"" for simplicity? Since it doesn't repeat E.

So guess: ""begun""

<guess>begun</guess>Based on the feedback:
- Guess 1 (""roast"") eliminated R, O, A, S, T.
- Guess 2 (""medic"") shows E as correct in position 2 and eliminates M, D, I, C.
- Excluded letters: R, O, A, S, T, M, D, I, C.
- Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- Secret word format: _ E _ _ _.

To maximize information from new letters, the next guess uses B, G, U, and N (common letters from the available pool) while fixing E in position 2. ""Begun"" is a valid 5-letter word that fits this structure and tests new vowels and consonants. It avoids reused or excluded letters.

<guess>begun</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: roast -> FEEDBACK: R(x) O(x) A(x) S(x) T(x)
Guess 2: medic -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(✓) D(x) I(x) C(x)
Guess 3: begun -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(✓) G(x) U(x) N(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the following feedback:
- From Guess 1 (roast): R, O, A, S, T are not in the word at all.
- From Guess 2 (medic): M, D, I, C are not in the word. E is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- From Guess 3 (begun): B, G, U, N are not in the word. E is again confirmed in position 2 (which we already knew).

So, the secret word has the second letter as E, and the following letters are excluded: R, O, A, S, T, M, D, I, C, B, G, U, N.

Now, the available letters are: F, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The word structure is: _ E _ _ _

We need to form a 5-letter word with E in the second position, using only the available letters.

Let's list possible words:

- We need to fill positions 1, 3, 4, 5 with letters from {F, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z}.

Common words that fit:
- ""JEWEL"": But J is available, E is fixed, W is available, E again? But we don't know if E is repeated? However, we have to use available letters. But ""JEWEL"" has E at position 2 and 4? And L at the end. But we have to check if the letters are available: J, W, L are available? Yes. But note: we have not excluded E? But we know E is in the word at position 2, but we don't know if it appears again. However, in ""JEWEL"", we are using E at position 4? That might be acceptable? But we are trying to test new letters? Using E again might not give new information? But if the secret word has E at position 4, we get a hit? Otherwise, we know it's not there? But we have limited letters? Also, ""JEWEL"" has two E's? So we are testing J, W, L? And E at position 4? But we are allowed to use E? It's not excluded? But we are trying to cover as many new letters as possible? So using E again might be inefficient? But we have to form a valid word.

Alternatively, avoid repeating E? But it might be hard? Because we have few vowels left? The available vowels are only Y? And sometimes W? But we have U? U is excluded? From ""begun"": U(x) -> excluded? So no U. Vowels available: only Y? And we have E already? So the word must have Y? Or no other vowels? But we can have words without vowels? But English words have vowels? So we need Y? Or we can have words with Y as vowel? Or we can use W? But W is consonant? So the only vowel available is Y? Because E is already used? And we cannot use A, I, O, U? They are excluded? So the secret word must have Y? Or it might have E repeated? But we don't know.

Therefore, we should consider words that include Y? Because without Y, we might not have a vowel? But we have E at position 2? So the other positions can be consonants? But we need a vowel? Not necessarily? For example, ""myth"" has Y? But we need 5 letters? And position 2 is E? So the word must have E at position 2? And then other letters? But we can have words like ""DEBYE"" but D excluded? Not.

So let's think of words with Y? And E at position 2.

For example:
- ""KEYED"": But E at position 2? K(1), E(2), Y(3), E(4), D(5) -> D excluded? Invalid.
- ""JEY"" not 5 letters.
- ""HEY"" not 5.

""EYRIE"": E at position 1? Not position 2? We need position 2 E? So ""EYRIE"" is E,Y,R,I,E -> R and I excluded? Invalid.

""LYCEE"": L,Y,C,E,E -> C excluded? Invalid.

""PYGMY"": P,Y,G,M,Y -> G and M excluded? Invalid.

""WHEYS"": W,H,E,Y,S -> S excluded? Invalid.

""FJELD"": F,J,E,L,D -> D excluded? Invalid.

This is challenging.

Another idea: perhaps the word has Y in it? And we use it? But we need a word with E at position 2 and Y somewhere.

For example: 
- ""LEVY"": not 5 letters.
- ""LEERY"": L,E,E,R,Y -> R excluded? Invalid.
- ""PEWIT"": P,E,W,I,T -> I and T excluded? Invalid.

Perhaps we need to use Y in position 1,3,4, or 5? And E at 2.

Let me list possible words from the available letters: F, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word: [F/H/J/K/L/P/Q/V/W/X/Y/Z] E [F/H/J/K/L/P/Q/V/W/X/Y/Z] [F/H/J/K/L/P/Q/V/W/X/Y/Z] [F/H/J/K/L/P/Q/V/W/X/Y/Z]

And it must be a valid English word.

Some possibilities:
- ""HELLO"": but O excluded? And L repeated? Also O excluded? Invalid.
- ""JELLY"": J,E,L,L,Y -> but we have L repeated? And Y? Now, letters: J, L, Y are available? Yes. And E at position 2? So ""JELLY"" is J(1), E(2), L(3), L(4), Y(5). But L is repeated? We can do that? The word is valid? Yes. And it uses J, L, Y? But L twice? So we are testing J, L, Y? But L is tested twice? If L is not in the word, we get two x's? But if L is in the word, we might get one or two hits? But it's acceptable? But we are using one letter twice? Which means we are not testing as many new letters? But we have to form a word? So it might be necessary.

Another word: ""KEVEL"": K,E,V,E,L -> E repeated? And V, L? But E at position 2 and 4? So ""KEVEL"" is K(1),E(2),V(3),E(4),L(5). But we are using E twice? And V, L? But we know E at position 2? So we are testing K, V, L? And E at position 4? But again, we are repeating E? And we have only 4 new letters? But we are testing 3 new letters? Because E is repeated? So not efficient? But we have to.

Another: ""PEWEE"": P,E,W,E,E -> E repeated? And W? But P and W? But E at position 2,4,5? And we know position 2 E? So we are testing P, W? And E at 4 and 5? But only two new letters? Not good.

""YELP"": not 5 letters.

""YELPS"": Y,E,L,P,S -> S excluded? Invalid.

""YEW"" not 5.

""YEUKS"": Y,E,U,K,S -> U and S excluded? Invalid.

""YEXES"": Y,E,X,E,S -> S excluded? Invalid.

""YECCH"": Y,E,C,C,H -> C excluded? Invalid.

""YE"": not 5.

""KEEPS"": K,E,E,P,S -> S excluded? Invalid.

""HEFTY"": H,E,F,T,Y -> T excluded? Invalid.

""HELIX"": H,E,L,I,X -> I excluded? Invalid.

""HELLY"": H,E,L,L,Y -> H, L, Y? And E at 2? So ""HELLY"" is a word? Meaning? I think it's a valid word (a type of boat or something)? But let's assume it's valid? Or ""JELLY"" is more common.

""HELVE"": H,E,L,V,E -> E repeated? And V? But H, L, V? And E at 2 and 5? So ""HELVE"" is H(1),E(2),L(3),V(4),E(5). We are testing H, L, V? And E at position 5? But we are using E twice? So only three new letters? But we have to.

""HEVEA"": H,E,V,E,A -> A excluded? Invalid.

""HEXAD"": H,E,X,A,D -> A and D excluded? Invalid.

""HEXED"": H,E,X,E,D -> D excluded? Invalid.

""HEXER"": H,E,X,E,R -> R excluded? Invalid.

""HEXYL"": H,E,X,Y,L -> H, X, Y, L? And E at 2? So ""HEXYL"" is a word? In chemistry? Valid? Yes. So H(1),E(2),X(3),Y(4),L(5). This uses H, X, Y, L? All new letters? And no repeats? Perfect? We are testing four new letters: H, X, Y, L.

And it doesn't repeat E? So we get maximum information.

Is ""HEXYL"" a valid word? Yes, it is a chemical term for a radical.

So we can use ""HEXYL"".

Another option: ""JEWEL"" we thought earlier? J,E,W,E,L -> but E repeated? And W, L? But ""HEXYL"" has no repeat and four new letters? Better.

""KEXES"": K,E,X,E,S -> S excluded? Invalid.

""LEVEE"": L,E,V,E,E -> E repeated? And V? But L and V? And we know E at 2? So not as good.

""PEWIT"": has I? Invalid.

""VEXED"": V,E,X,E,D -> D excluded? Invalid.

""WEXED"": not common? And D? Invalid.

""YELMS"": Y,E,L,M,S -> M and S excluded? Invalid.

So ""HEXYL"" seems a good choice.

Therefore, we guess ""HEXYL"".

<guess>hexyl</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""roast""** → All letters (R, O, A, S, T) are **absent** from the secret word.  
- **Guess 2: ""medic""** → Only **E** is **correct and in position 2**. Letters M, D, I, C are **absent**.  
- **Guess 3: ""begun""** → Only **E** is **correct and in position 2** (reaffirmed). Letters B, G, U, N are **absent**.  

### Key Insights:
1. **Secret word structure**: The second letter is **E** (confirmed by both Guess 2 and 3).  
   - Format: `_ E _ _ _`
2. **Excluded letters (15 total)**: R, O, A, S, T (from Guess 1), M, D, I, C (from Guess 2), B, G, U, N (from Guess 3).  
3. **Available letters (11 remaining)**: F, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
4. **Constraints**:  
   - The word must include **E only in position 2** (no evidence of repetition, but E can be reused if necessary).  
   - Focus on testing **new, high-frequency consonants** (e.g., L, H, P) and the **vowel Y** (since A, I, O, U are excluded, Y is the only untested vowel-like letter).  
   - Avoid repeating letters from failed guesses to maximize information gain.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Prioritize words** that:  
  - Use **E in position 2**.  
  - Include **multiple new letters** from the available pool (especially H, L, Y, X for broad coverage).  
  - Avoid reused letters to test as many new positions as possible.  
- **Optimal candidate**: ""HEXYL"" (valid 5-letter word).  
  - **Structure**: H (position 1), E (position 2, fixed), X (position 3), Y (position 4), L (position 5).  
  - **Why ""HEXYL""?**  
    - Tests **4 new letters**: H, X, Y, L (all high-value: L and H are common consonants; X and Y are less common but critical to check).  
    - Uses **Y as a vowel substitute** (essential since no other vowels are available).  
    - No letter repetition (efficient for information gain).  
    - Real word (scientific term for a chemical radical).  

If ""HEXYL"" is incorrect, feedback on H, X, Y, L will significantly narrow possibilities (e.g., revealing if Y is present or if L/H are key consonants).

<guess>hexyl</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: roast -> FEEDBACK: R(x) O(x) A(x) S(x) T(x)
Guess 2: medic -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(✓) D(x) I(x) C(x)
Guess 3: begun -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(✓) G(x) U(x) N(x)
Guess 4: hexyl -> FEEDBACK: H(x) E(✓) X(x) Y(x) L(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the feedback from four guesses:

1. ""roast"" -> R, O, A, S, T are all absent (x)
2. ""medic"" -> M, D, I, C are absent (x), and E is correct and in the right position (position 2, ✓)
3. ""begun"" -> B, G, U, N are absent (x), and E is again confirmed in position 2 (✓)
4. ""hexyl"" -> H, X, Y are absent (x), E is correct in position 2 (✓), and L is correct and in the right position (position 5, ✓)

So, from the feedback:

- The secret word has the second letter E and the fifth letter L.
- The secret word does not contain: R, O, A, S, T, M, D, I, C, B, G, U, N, H, X, Y.

Additionally, from ""hexyl"", we know that L is in the fifth position and is correct.

So the secret word pattern is: _ E _ _ L

And the excluded letters are: R, O, A, S, T, M, D, I, C, B, G, U, N, H, X, Y.

Now, what letters are left? The alphabet minus the excluded ones.

Excluded: A, B, C, D, G, H, I, M, N, O, R, S, T, U, X, Y.

So available letters: F, J, K, P, Q, V, W, Z.

But note: we have three positions to fill: first, third, and fourth.

The word is: [1] E [3] [4] L

We need to form a 5-letter word with the available letters: F, J, K, P, Q, V, W, Z.

Also, note that the word must be a valid English word.

Let's try to find words that fit this pattern.

Possible words:

- We need a word of the form ? E ? ? L

With the middle two letters (positions 3 and 4) being from F, J, K, P, Q, V, W, Z, and the first letter also from that set.

But note: we have only 8 letters available, and we need to use three of them (one for first, one for third, one for fourth) without repetition? Not necessarily, but since we don't know about repetition, we can try without repetition first.

List of available letters: F, J, K, P, Q, V, W, Z.

Now, common words? Let's think:

- ""JEWEL"": But we have E and L, but J is available? But ""JEWEL"" is J,E,W,E,L -> but position 4 is E? And we have E at position 2? Also, W is available. But the pattern is ? E ? ? L, so for ""JEWEL"": 
  Position 1: J, Position 2: E, Position 3: W, Position 4: E, Position 5: L.
  But position 4 is E? And we know position 2 is E? So it has two E's? But is that allowed? Yes, but we don't know if the secret word has two E's. Also, in the available letters, E is not excluded? But we are allowed to use E? However, in the feedback so far, we only know about one E (at position 2). But in ""hexyl"", we didn't test E elsewhere? So it's possible.

But in ""JEWEL"", we are using E at position 4? That might be a good test? But note: the available letters for positions 3 and 4 should be from F,J,K,P,Q,V,W,Z? E is not in that set? Because E is not excluded, but we are not forced to use only the available set? We can use E? But we know E is in the word? So we can use it again? But in this case, we are trying to fill the positions with letters that might be in the word? But we have limited information.

Actually, we can use any letter that hasn't been excluded? But E is not excluded? We only know it's in position 2? It could be elsewhere? So we can use E in other positions? But in our available set, we didn't include E because we are focusing on new letters? But technically, E is still available to use? However, to maximize information, we might want to avoid reusing known letters? But in this case, we have to form a word? And we have few options.

But let's see: the available letters for new information are F,J,K,P,Q,V,W,Z? But E is known, so we can use it? But if we use E, we might not get new information? Unless we are testing if it appears again.

But in this pattern, we have to have a word that ends with L and has E at position 2? So let's list possible words.

Another word: ""LEVEL"": But L is at position 1 and 5? But we know position 5 is L? And position 2 is E? But ""LEVEL"" has E at position 2 and 4? And L at 1,3,5? But position 3 is V? But V is available? But let's see: 
  Position 1: L -> but we don't know if L is at position 1? And we have to use available letters? But L is not in the available set? Because L is now known to be in the word? But we are not excluding L? We can use it? But we know L is at position 5? So if we put L at position 1, it might be correct or not? But in ""hexyl"", we only tested L at position 5? So we don't know about other positions? But in ""hexyl"", L was at position 5 and correct? But we don't know if L is at other positions? So we can test? But we have to form a word.

However, in ""LEVEL"", position 1 is L? And we have available letters? But L is not in the set {F,J,K,P,Q,V,W,Z}? Because we derived the available set as the letters not excluded? But L is not excluded? We only know it's in the word at position 5? So L is still available to use? But we are trying to test new letters? So it might be better to avoid L? Because we already know it's in the word? But we don't know if it appears twice? So we can test? But with few letters left, we might not need to.

But let's clarify: the excluded letters are only those marked (x) in feedback? So L is not excluded? We can use it? But we are trying to find the secret word? We know position 5 is L? So we don't need to test position 5? But for other positions, we can use L? But it might be inefficient? Because if we use L at position 1, and it's not in the word at position 1, we get feedback? But we have to form a valid word? So if necessary, we can.

But in this case, with the available letters F,J,K,P,Q,V,W,Z, we don't have L? So we cannot use L in positions 1,3,4? Because L is not in the available set? The available set is the letters that haven't been excluded? And L is not excluded? So we can use L? But we are focusing on the letters that are still possible for being in the word? But we know L is in the word? So it's not necessary to test it again? But we can use it to form words? However, to maximize information, we should use letters that we haven't tested? Which are F,J,K,P,Q,V,W,Z? And avoid E and L? Because we already know about them? But E and L are in the word? So we can use them? But if we use them, we might not get new information? For example, if we use E at position 4, we can find out if it's there? Similarly for L.

But let's try to find words that use only F,J,K,P,Q,V,W,Z for positions 1,3,4? And E at 2, L at 5? But that might be hard? Because we need a vowel? The only vowel we have is E? And we are using it at position 2? But positions 3 and 4 are consonants? So the word must be composed of consonants except for E? And L? But L is consonant? So positions 1,3,4 must be consonants? And we have F,J,K,P,Q,V,W,Z? All consonants? So it's possible? But we need a valid word.

For example:
- ""JEWEL"": But position 4 is E? Not a consonant? And E is not in the available set? But we can use it? But let's see: if we use ""JEWEL"", then position 3 is W? Which is available? Position 4 is E? Which is known? But we are testing if E is at position 4? And position 1 is J? Available.

But ""JEWEL"" has two E's? And we are using E at position 4? That might be acceptable? But we are not using a new letter for position 4? We are using E? Which we already know? So we lose the chance to test a new letter? But we have to form a word? And we have few options.

Another word: ""KEVEL"": K,E,V,E,L -> but position 4 is E? Again.

""PEWEL"": Not a word.

""VOWEL"": V,O,W,E,L -> O excluded? Invalid.

""JOWEL"": J,O,W,E,L -> O excluded.

""FEWEL"": Not a word.

""HEWEL"": H excluded.

Perhaps words without E in the middle? 

For example, ""JETEL"": Not a word.

""KEXEL"": Not a word.

""PEWEL"": Not a word.

""QUEL"": Not 5 letters.

""QUELL"": Q,U,E,L,L -> U excluded? And two L's? But U excluded.

""BEVEL"": B excluded and E at 4.

This is difficult.

Another idea: perhaps the word is ""JUMPS"" but U and S excluded.

We need to consider that the secret word might have repeated letters? But we don't know.

Perhaps we can use a word that has E at 2, L at 5, and in between, use two of the available letters.

For example, ""JEP L"" not a word.

""KEPL"": not 5.

""REPEL"": R and E at 4? R excluded.

""SEPAL"": S and A excluded.

""TEPAL"": T and A excluded.

""VEGEL"": V,E,G,E,L -> G excluded.

""WEF L"" not a word.

""ZEXEL"": Not a word.

Perhaps ""FJELD"": F,J,E,L,D -> D excluded.

I am considering using a word that has Y? But Y is excluded? From ""hexyl"": Y(x) -> absent? So we cannot use Y.

Similarly, all the excluded letters are out.

Another common word: ""LEVEL"" but we have L at position 1 and 3? And E at 2 and 4? But position 5 is L? So ""LEVEL"" is L,E,V,E,L.

But V is available? So if we guess ""LEVEL"", then:
- Position 1: L -> we don't know if L is at position 1? But we know L is at position 5? So if we guess L at position 1, it might be correct or not? And position 3: V? Available? Position 4: E? We don't know.

But ""LEVEL"" uses L at position 1 and 3? And E at 4? So we are testing V? And also testing if L is at position 1 and 3? And if E is at position 4? But we have only one new letter: V? Because L and E are known? But we are testing their positions? So it might be acceptable? But we have other options?

But with the available letters, we can try ""VELL"": not 5.

Perhaps ""PELL"": not 5.

Let's list all possible words that fit the pattern ? E ? ? L and use only the available letters or known letters.

But known letters are E and L? And available new letters are F,J,K,P,Q,V,W,Z.

So the word must be composed of letters from {E, L, F, J, K, P, Q, V, W, Z}? But E and L are already in the word? So we can use them? But we are trying to find the secret word? We know E at 2 and L at 5? So positions 1,3,4 should be from F,J,K,P,Q,V,W,Z? Or possibly E or L? But if we use E or L, we are not testing new letters? So ideally, we use new letters.

But is there any word that has E at 2, L at 5, and positions 1,3,4 from F,J,K,P,Q,V,W,Z?

For example:
- ""J E P L L"" -> not a word.
- ""J E K L L"" -> not a word.
- ""J E W L L"" -> not a word.
- ""F E J L L"" -> not a word.
- ""F E K L L"" -> not a word.
- ""F E P L L"" -> not a word.
- ""F E V L L"" -> not a word.
- ""F E W L L"" -> not a word.
- ""F E Z L L"" -> not a word.
- ""K E J L L"" -> not a word.
- ""K E F L L"" -> not a word.
- ""K E P L L"" -> not a word.
- ""K E V L L"" -> not a word.
- ""K E W L L"" -> not a word.
- ""K E Z L L"" -> not a word.
- ""P E J L L"" -> not a word.
- ""P E F L L"" -> not a word.
- ""P E K L L"" -> not a word.
- ""P E V L L"" -> not a word.
- ""P E W L L"" -> not a word.
- ""P E Z L L"" -> not a word.
- ""Q E F L L"" -> not a word.
- ""Q E J L L"" -> not a word.
- ""Q E K L L"" -> not a word.
- ""Q E P L L"" -> not a word.
- ""Q E V L L"" -> not a word.
- ""Q E W L L"" -> not a word.
- ""Q E Z L L"" -> not a word.
- ""V E F L L"" -> not a word.
- ""V E J L L"" -> not a word.
- ""V E K L L"" -> not a word.
- ""V E P L L"" -> not a word.
- ""V E W L L"" -> not a word.
- ""V E Z L L"" -> not a word.
- ""W E F L L"" -> not a word.
- ""W E J L L"" -> not a word.
- ""W E K L L"" -> not a word.
- ""W E P L L"" -> not a word.
- ""W E V L L"" -> not a word.
- ""W E Z L L"" -> not a word.
- ""Z E F L L"" -> not a word.
- ""Z E J L L"" -> not a word.
- ""Z E K L L"" -> not a word.
- ""Z E P L L"" -> not a word.
- ""Z E V L L"" -> not a word.
- ""Z E W L L"" -> not a word.

None of these are words? Because they have two L's at the end? That's not typical.

Perhaps with one L? But we have L at position 5? So position 4 is not L? So we need a letter at position 4.

Another idea: perhaps the word has only one L? And we use different letters.

For example, ""J E W E L"" -> ""jewel"" which is a word? But position 4 is E? So we are using E at position 4? And W at position 3? And J at position 1? And L at position 5? And E at position 2.

So ""JEWEL"" is a valid word? Yes.

And it uses J and W? Which are available? And E at position 4? Which is known? But we are testing if E is at position 4? And also testing J and W.

Similarly, ""V E X E L"" -> but X excluded? From ""hexyl"": X(x) -> absent? So we cannot use X.

""K E Y E L"" -> Y excluded.

""F E E B L"" -> B excluded.

So ""JEWEL"" seems to be a candidate.

Another word: ""P E E L"" -> not 5 letters.

""PEELS"" -> S excluded.

""KEELS"" -> S excluded.

""VEELS"" -> S excluded and E at 4.

""J E V E L"" -> ""JEVEL"" not a word.

""J E P L E"" -> not L at position 5.

We need L at position 5.

So ""JEWEL"" is one option.

Another: ""F E L L"" -> not 5.

""K E L L"" -> not 5.

""P E L L"" -> not 5.

""V E L L"" -> not 5.

""W E L L"" -> not 5.

""Z E L L"" -> not 5.

""J E L L"" -> not 5.

So perhaps ""JEWEL"" is the only common word that fits? Or are there others?

""HEWEL"" not a word.

""NEWEL"": N excluded.

""MEWEL"": M excluded.

""TEWEL"": T excluded.

""DEWEL"": D excluded.

""REWEL"": R excluded.

So ""JEWEL"" seems to be the best bet.

But in ""JEWEL"", we are using E at position 4? Which is not a new letter? But we are testing if it is in the word at that position? And we are testing J and W? Which are new.

Also, from the available letters, we have to use some of them.

So let's go with ""JEWEL"".

But we have to make sure that J and W are not excluded? They are not in the excluded list.

Excluded: A,B,C,D,G,H,I,M,N,O,R,S,T,U,X,Y

So J and W are available.

So guess ""jewel"".

But in the feedback for ""hexyl"", we have L at position 5 correct? So in ""jewel"", position 5 is L? Which is correct? Position 2 is E? Correct? Position 1: J, position 3: W, position 4: E.

So we will get feedback on J, W, and E at position 4.

If the secret word has E at position 4, we get a ✓ for that? Otherwise, if E is not at position 4, we get a - or x? But since E is in the word, if it's not at position 4, it would be marked with - (present but wrong position)? But we already have E at position 2? So if there is only one E, then position 4 would be x? But if there is another E, it would be - or ✓? But we don't know.

But anyway, it's a valid guess.

Perhaps there is a word like ""F E C K L"" but C excluded.

I think ""JEWEL"" is the best we can do.

So I'll go with that.

<guess>jewel</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""roast""** → All letters (R, O, A, S, T) are **absent** from the secret word.  
- **Guess 2: ""medic""** → Only **E** is **correct and in position 2**. Letters M, D, I, C are **absent**.  
- **Guess 3: ""begun""** → Only **E** is **correct and in position 2** (reaffirmed). Letters B, G, U, N are **absent**.  
- **Guess 4: ""hexyl""** → **E** is **correct in position 2**, **L** is **correct in position 5**, and H, X, Y are **absent**.  

### Key Insights:
1. **Secret word structure**:  
   - Position 2 is **E** (confirmed).  
   - Position 5 is **L** (confirmed).  
   - Format: `_ E _ _ L`  
2. **Excluded letters (16 total)**:  
   - R, O, A, S, T (from Guess 1).  
   - M, D, I, C (from Guess 2).  
   - B, G, U, N (from Guess 3).  
   - H, X, Y (from Guess 4).  
3. **Available letters (10 remaining)**: F, J, K, P, Q, V, W, Z.  
4. **Constraints**:  
   - The word must start with a letter from the available set (F, J, K, P, Q, V, W, Z).  
   - Positions 3 and 4 must also use letters from the available set or known letters (E, L), but E and L are already confirmed at positions 2 and 5.  
   - The word must be a valid English word.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Prioritize words** that:  
  - Fit the `_ E _ _ L` structure.  
  - Use **new letters** from the available pool (F, J, K, P, Q, V, W, Z) to maximize information gain.  
  - Avoid reused letters to test untested positions.  
- **Optimal candidate**: ""JEWEL"" (valid 5-letter word).  
  - **Structure**: J (position 1), E (position 2, fixed), W (position 3), E (position 4), L (position 5, fixed).  
  - **Why ""JEWEL""?**  
    - Tests **J and W** (new high-value letters from the available pool).  
    - Tests if **E appears again** at position 4 (possible given English word patterns).  
    - Real word (common noun, meaning a precious stone).  
- If ""JEWEL"" is incorrect, feedback on J, W, and E at position 4 will significantly narrow possibilities (e.g., revealing if E is repeated or if J/W are present).

We should pick common letters that haven\'t been tried.\n\n The remaining vowels are E, I, U (since A and O are out). Consonants: we have many left like B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n Since we have no correct letters, we want to maximize new information. So we should include more common vowels and consonants.\n\n Common letters in English: E, I, L, N, U, etc. We can also consider words with repeated letters? But typically for second guess we avoid repeats since we have 5-letter unique words? Actually, Wordle allows repeated letters but in this case, since we haven\'t seen any, maybe we avoid for now.\n\n A good candidate might be ""CLINE"". However, C and L are common. Alternatively, ""DEUCE"" has two E\'s and U. But it has E twice? Maybe let\'s pick a word without repeats.\n\n Another idea: ""PLUCK"" uses P, L, U, C, K. But U is a vowel? Or we can choose ""NYMPH"" but it has Y (which can be vowel) and is not very common.\n\n Important: We need to cover as many common letters as possible.\n\n Common letters remaining: E (most common), then I, L, N, U, D, M, H, C, etc.\n\n I propose a word that uses E and I (vowels) and three common consonants: L, N, D, H, C, etc.\n\n Example: ""LINED"" -> L, I, N, E, D. This gives us two vowels (I, E) and three consonants (L, N, D).\n\n But note: we have already eliminated R,O,A,S,T so we must avoid them.\n\n Alternatively, ""CHIME"": C, H, I, M, E. This covers E, C, H, I, M.\n\n Another one: ""LEECH"" but it has repeated E? And H at end. Better to avoid repeats? Yes, because we don\'t know if there is repetition.\n\n Let me choose ""CHIME"". It has C, H, I, M, E. All new letters and covers common vowels and consonants.\n\n But note: there might be a word that covers more frequent letters? E, I are high frequency.\n\n Alternatively, ""QUERY"" but Q is rare and we have eliminated R? R is already eliminated so we must not use R.\n\n Another candidate: ""FILCH"" has F, I, L, C, H. F is less common? Maybe skip.\n\n How about ""MEDIC""? M, E, D, I, C. That\'s M, E, D, I, C. Also good because it covers E and I.\n\n Let me choose ""MEDIC"". It uses M, E, D, I, C.\n\n However, note that ""CHIME"" is also good. I\'ll go with ""MEDIC"" because D and C are very common.\n\n Wait, another idea: ""PINEY"", but Y is sometimes vowel and we haven\'t tested Y? But we are avoiding R,O,A,S,T so P,I,N,E,Y. But Y is the last letter and might be less common? Actually, Y is common in words as a vowel.\n\n But let me stick to ""MEDIC"".\n\n Alternatively, ""ELUDE""? E, L, U, D, E. Wait, repeated E? Not allowed? The rules don\'t say repeated letters are disallowed, but in the guess we can have repeated letters? However, the word must be valid. But for efficiency, we might want to avoid repeats to cover more letters.\n\n Since we didn\'t get any positive feedback, we want to test as many new letters as possible. Therefore, we should avoid repeating letters in this guess?\n\n Absolutely. So ""ELUDE"" has two E\'s so it\'s not ideal. Similarly, ""LEECH"" is no.\n\n So ""MEDIC"" is unique letters: M, E, D, I, C.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""MEDIC"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""roast"" – where none of the letters (R, O, A, S, T) are in the secret word – we need to avoid those letters entirely in our next guess. \n\nTo maximize information, we should test new common vowels and consonants. The word ""**medic**"" incorporates:\n- **M, E, D, I, C**: These are high-frequency letters (avoiding the eliminated ones)  \n- Covers 2 new vowels (E, I) and 3 new consonants (M, D, C)  \n- Helps quickly check if any of these dominant letters appear in the secret word  \n\nThis strategic guess narrows possibilities while adhering to the feedback.\n\n<guess>medic</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: roast -> FEEDBACK: R(x) O(x) A(x) S(x) T(x)\nGuess 2: medic -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(✓) D(x) I(x) C(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two guesses and their feedback:\n1.

Actually: J(1), E(2), W(3), E(4), L(5). So position 2 is E. But note it has E twice. Also, letters: J, W, E, L. E is already known, so we are testing J, W, L. However, E appears again? But we don\'t know if E repeats. We are allowed to guess repeated letters? The rules don\'t forbid it, but since E is already known to be in position 2, it might be redundant? Not necessarily, if E appears twice we can get a - or ✓ for the second E? However, currently we only know one E. But if we guess a word with two E\'s, we can test if there is a second E.\n\nBut we need to avoid excluded letters. Checking: J is available, E is allowed (but we know it\'s in position 2, so position 4 if we put E would be another test), W, L.\n\nBut note: E in position 4: if the secret word does not have E in position 4, but has E elsewhere, we might get a - sign? Actually, the feedback would say - if it\'s somewhere else? But we already have E in position 2 correct. However, we are testing for other letters too.\n\nBut let\'s avoid repeats for now? Because we want to maximize the number of new letters? Since we don\'t know, maybe keep it simple.\n\nAnother word: ""LEECH"" -> L, E, E, C, H -> but C is excluded? C was in the excluded list from guess 2.\n\nNo, C is excluded (from ""medic"": C(x)).\n\nSo let\'s avoid using E again if possible? To test more letters.\n\nOptions:\n- ""FEIGN"" -> F, E, I, G, N -> I is excluded? From guess 2: I(x). So I is excluded? Yes, because I got x.\n\nExcluded letters: R, O, A, S, T, M, D, I, C.\n\nSo in ""FEIGN"": I is excluded -> invalid.\n\n- ""NEVER"" -> N, E, V, E, R -> but R is excluded? R was in first guess with x -> invalid.\n\n- ""HELP"" -> H, E, L, P -> only 4 letters? Must be 5 letters.\n\nWe need 5-letter words.\n\nPerhaps:\n- ""BEVEL"": B, E, V, E, L -> uses E twice? But B, V, L are new.\nBut E appears at position 2 and position 5? Positions: B(1), E(2), V(3), E(4), L(5). Actually, position 4 would be E? But we are going to have position 2 E known, so we are testing B, V, L at positions 1,3,5 and also testing if position 4 is E? That might be inefficient because if we don\'t get a second E, it doesn\'t help as much? But we can try.\n\nHowever, we are allowed to do so.\n\nAnother word: ""FJELD"" -> F, J, E, L, D -> D is excluded? From guess 2, D(x) -> invalid.\n\nLet\'s find words that only use available letters: B, F, G, H, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z and the vowel U or Y? And not using E again? But E is in a known position so we can skip other E? Or we can use E? Actually, we might want to test for repetition? Since we don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, avoid E repetition for more coverage? We have few guesses left.\n\nAnother candidate: ""BLEWY"" -> not valid? Let\'s list:\n\n""BEVY"" is not 5 letters.\n\nActually: \n- ""LEVEL"" -> L,E,V,E,L -> but L repeated? And position 2 is E -> good? But V is included. However: letters: L, E, V -> but V, L are new? And we test if E is at position 4? And L at beginning and end? But it has two L\'s and two E\'s? Also, L and E are being tested? However, we don\'t know if L is in the word? Actually, the secret word might have L? We haven\'t tested.\n\nBut the excluded letters: we cannot use R,O,A,S,T,M,D,I,C -> LEVEL uses L, E, V -> L and V are allowed.\n\nBut: positions:\nPosition 1: L -> new\nPosition 2: E -> ✓ (we know)\nPosition 3: V -> new\nPosition 4: E -> we don\'t know? This would test position 4.\nPosition 5: L -> same as position 1? So if L is in the word? But wait, testing two positions for L? Might be useful.\n\nBut the word ""level"" is valid? Well, LEVEL is a word.\n\nAlternatively, let me try ""BLEEP"" -> B, L, E, E, P -> valid? But P is allowed? And E at 3rd and 4th? Actually position 2: we are expecting E -> so we need to have E at position 2? No: the structure we need is any second letter E.\n\nFor ""BLEEP"": positions are B(1), L(2), E(3), E(4), P(5) -> but position 2 is L? It must be E? So that guess would be invalid? Because we don\'t have E in the second position? For our guess, we must have E in the second position? Because we know that the secret word has E as the second letter? So in our guess, we must put E in the second position? Otherwise, we might get a - or x for E? But the feedback for E would be - if it\'s in another position? But we want to use the known E to keep position 2 correct? Actually, we can change? But it\'s not necessary? Because if we put E elsewhere and get ✓, we would know? But we only know position 2 has E? So we can try putting E at another position? However, to maximize efficiency, we can perhaps keep position 2 as E? That way we have 4 other positions? Or we can move E to test? But since we don\'t know if there is another E, we can try.\n\nBut it might be better to have position 2 fixed as E to lock that position? Then test other letters? Then we know always one letter is E and in place? So we can focus on the rest.\n\nGiven that, let\'s fix position 2 as E and choose other letters from the available pool.\n\nSo guess: [first] E [third] [fourth] [fifth]\n\nLetters: first, third, fourth, fifth must be from {B, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z} excluding already excluded? As above, as long as not in excluded letters.\n\nCommon combinations: \n- Words like ""BELOW"" -> but O is excluded? O is excluded? From first guess: O(x) -> invalid.\n- ""BEING"" -> I excluded? From guess 2 -> invalid.\n- ""HONEY"" -> O excluded? Invalid.\n- ""KEYED"" -> E at fourth? Also D excluded -> invalid.\n\nTry ""LENES"" -> L,E,N,E,S -> S excluded? From first guess? S(x) -> invalid.\n\nAnother: ""BELLE"" -> B, E, L, L, E -> repeated E and L? And second letter E? Positions: B(1), E(2), L(3), L(4), E(5). Uses B, L, E -> L is new? So we test B and L? But two L\'s.\n\nBetter words?\nHow about ""UVEA"" -> too short.\n\nPerhaps: ""QUEUE"" -> Q, U, E, U, E -> second position E? No, position 1:Q,2:U, etc -> not E in second?\n\nNeed word: _ E _ _ _\n\nOptions:\n- ""FEIGN"" -> not allowed because I excluded? Yes.\n- ""NEIGH"" -> N, E, I, G, H -> I excluded? Invalid.\n\nWithout I: \n- ""LEGAL"" -> L,E,G,A -> but A excluded? Invalid.\n\nAvailable vowels: U and Y.\n\nSo words with U or Y in them? Or all consonants?\n\nExample: ""DEUCE"" -> D excluded? Invalid.\n- ""YEUKY"" -> not valid word.\n\n""YEXES"" -> but X and S? S excluded.\n\nCommon word: ""HONEY"" -> O excluded? No, O is excluded.\n\nAnother: ""FLUKE"" -> F, L, U, K, E -> but E at fifth? We have E at position 2 -> so we need E at position 2? But FLUKE has E at position 5? So to avoid having E at all? Or have at position 2? If we use FLUKE, position 2 is L, which we don\'t know? Then feedback: position 5 E might be ✓ or x? But we know E is in the word? So if we put E at position 5, it might get ✓ if it is indeed there? But we also have position 2? We don\'t know position 2? We do know position 2 is E? So it\'s better to use a word that has E at position 2? To keep that spot? Otherwise, we lose a chance? Or get more info?\n\nLet me clarify: the secret word has E in position 2? So if we guess a word without E at position 2, then E (if at position 5) might get marked with - or ✓? If at position 5, ✓ would mean the secret has E at position 5? But we already know E at position 2? So the word could have two E\'s? Or if we don\'t have E at position 2, then we\'d get feedback that position 2 is not E? But it is E in the secret? So that would be wasteful? Because we already know it\'s E? So we always want E at position 2? To lock that? Then we don\'t have to retest? And we focus on the other letters? Yes.\n\nTherefore, we stick with having E in position 2? So the guess must have the second letter E? Then we can concentrate on discovering the other letters? So all guesses going forward should have E in position 2? Until we know more? Or we have the full word.\n\nSo: guess pattern: [letter] E [letter] [letter] [letter]\n\nWe need to pick word of the form X E Y Z W.\n\nAvailable letters: all except excluded: R,O,A,S,T,M,D,I,C.\n\nSo available: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,N,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nWe also have to avoid using excluded letters? And we want to cover common letters to narrow down.\n\nLet me list possible words:\n- ""BELOW"": includes O -> excluded? O is excluded -> no.\n- ""BENCH"": C excluded? C from ""medic"" got x -> excluded? So invalid.\n- ""FENCE"": E? But in addition to position 2? And C excluded? Invalid.\n- ""JELLY"": J,E,L,L,Y -> Y at the end? And L repeated. But letters: J,L,Y -> new? So valid? Word.\n\nJELLY: J,E,L,L,Y -> positions: J(1),E(2),(L at 3 and 4), Y(5). But it has two L\'s? We can do that? The word is acceptable? But we risk that L might be in the word once? But if it isn\'t, we duplicate? Or we can get feedback.\n\nAnother: ""LEVEL"" -> L,E,V,E,L -> but E at 4? Will be tested? And V? Levels? Valid? But E is at 2 and 4? Which we already know for position 2? So we can test if E is at position 4? And V and L? But we have two L\'s? Might be inefficient? Especially since we have limited guesses.\n\nBetter to pick a word with entirely new letters? Covering as many new common letters as possible.\n\nAvailable: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,N,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nCommon letters: L, H, N, P, U, B, etc.\n\nHow about ""BLUEY""? Not valid? ""BLEAK"" -> A excluded? Invalid.\n\n""PLUME"": P,L,U,M,E -> M excluded? From ""medic"": M(x)? M is excluded? Invalid.\n\n""FUNKY"": F,U,N,K,Y -> all new? And not excluded? F,U,N,K,Y are not excluded. Second letter E needed? ""FUNKY"" is F, U, N, K, Y? Position 2 is U? but we need position 2 to be E? So not this word? Because we want E at position 2? So we cannot just have any word? Must have E at position 2.\n\nCorrect form is X E Y Z W.\n\n""FUNKY"" doesn\'t have E.\n\nWhat about:\n- ""QUEEN"": Q,U,E,E,N -> good? Positions: Q(1), U(2)? U at position 2? We need E at position 2? But ""queen"" has E at position 3 and 4? Not position 2? So wrong pattern? We require the second letter to be E? But ""queen"" has second letter U? So it would be: positions:1:Q,2:U,3:E,4:E,5:N? Then feedback for E? We know secret has E at position 2? So if we guess ""queen"", position 2 U: if U is not in word? x? And E would be marked at position 3 and 4: if at position 3? But secret has E only at position 2? Then position 3 E might be x? Then position 2 U gets x? But we know position 2 is E? So that guess wastes position 2? We might still get U? Or not? The feedback for position 2 U will be ""x"" because the secret has E at position 2? Not U? So position 2: U is not E and U is not in the word? It would get x? Then positions 3 and 4, E would be at? But we know E is only at position 2? But secret might have more E\'s? If secret has E at position 3 as well? That\'s possible? But currently we only know position 2 E? So we don\'t know about others? Therefore, guessing a word without E at position 2 could be useful if we also include E elsewhere? To test for multiple E\'s? But it may not be efficient with only 6 tries? It\'s risky? Also, in this case, we would get position 2 U: if we guess ""queen"", feedback might be: position 1 Q? Then U? which will be x because position 2 must be E? Then E at position 3 or 4, if secret has E at position 3, it would be marked as - or ✓? But we don\'t know if secret has E elsewhere? So we can test? But we have E at position 2 confirmed? And we don\'t know about other positions? So perhaps we can use other guesses? But since we have 4 tries left? Maybe we stick to having E at position 2? So we can focus on the first, third, fourth, fifth letters? And not test E again? Or only if convenient? But let\'s focus on the available letters.\n\nA good word: ""PENAL"": P,E,N,A,L -> but A excluded? From the first feedback? A(x) -> invalid.\n\n""NEXUS"": N,E,X,U,S -> S excluded? Invalid.\n\n""BELCH"": B,E,L,C,H -> C excluded? Invalid.\n\nHow about ""YEH"" -> not 5 letters.\n\n""WEEDY"": W,E,E,D,Y -> D excluded? D(x) -> invalid.\n\n""VERGE"": V,E,R,G,E -> R excluded? Invalid.\n\nThis is difficult.\n\nLet\'s think of words with common available letters: U, L, N, H, etc.\n\n""EU K something"" but second letter E: so words like:\n- ""LEGER"": L,E,G,E,R -> R excluded? Invalid.\n- ""HEDGE"": H,E,D,G,E -> D excluded? Invalid.\n- ""LEVEL"" we thought earlier? But let\'s try something without excluded letters.\n\nAvailable: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,N,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nFor example:\n- ""FILE"" -> not 5 letters.\n- ""FILEK"" -> ""fickle"" -> but ""fickle"" has I? I excluded? Invalid.\n\n""JUKE"": not 5.\n\n""BEGUN"": B,E,G,U,N -> letters: B,G,U,N -> all available? And structure: B(1),E(2),G(3),U(4),N(5) -> so ""begun"" is a word? Yes. B E G U N.\n\nLetters: B,G,U,N are all new and available.\n\nThis is good? We haven\'t used any of these before? And not excluded.\n\nSo we can guess ""begun""? And check.\n\n""Begun"" meets all criteria? Position and letters are from available set.\n\nAnother candidate: ""HELIX"": H,E,L,I,X -> I excluded? I got x? Invalid.\n\n""VENUE"": V,E,N,U,E -> E at position 2 and 5? And U? Let\'s see: letters: V,N,U,E -> E is already known? And U? But ""venue"" structure: V(1),E(2),N(3),U(4),E(5). So we are testing V, N, U? And E at position 5? Which is new? But V,N,U are available? And E is known? So valid? But we are using E twice? That might be OK? But it could reveal if there\'s more than one E? However, we don\'t have a better choice? Alternatively, ""begun"" avoids doubling E.\n\nAlso, ""begun"" tests B,G,U,N? And not E repetition? Better? Since letters are different.\n\nSimilarly, ""P G U N something"" -> ""begun"" is one.\n\n""JEG U something"" not common.\n\n""VEGUN"" not a word.\n\nSo ""begun"" seems valid: B E G U N.\n\nAlternatively, ""BEVAN"" is not common? ""Bevel"" -> B,E,V,E,L -> has E twice? And L? Available? But E at position 4? And V? Also good.\n\nBut ""begun"" covers G and U? Also new.\n\nAnother option: ""LEVIN"": L,E,V,I,N -> I excluded? Invalid.\n\n""KELPY"": K,E,L,P,Y -> K,L,P,Y available? Yes? And E at position 2? So ""K E L P Y"" -> positions.\n\nBoth ""begun"" and ""kelpy"" are possible? Let\'s see: ""kelpy"" is a word? Yes, meaning a brown algal.\n\nWhich is better? ""begun"" has B,G,U,N? ""kelpy"" has K,L,P,Y? What letters are more common? In English, L is common, P is common, K, Y? U is common vowel? But U is less common than L? L is very common? Perhaps ""kelpy"" covers common letters? U is also common.\n\nBut to decide? We have to pick one.\n\nIn ""kelpy"" we have Y at the end? Which is also worth testing? But we don\'t know.\n\nAlso, ""begun"" has more vowels? U in position 4? But in the secret word, we know the second letter is E? And we don\'t know if there are other vowels? U could be there? But consonants? Both options have two vowels? E and U in ""begun""? In ""kelpy"" has E and Y? With Y acting as vowel.\n\nBut ""begun"" uses U which is a vowel? And we don\'t have U tested? So good.\n\nBut whichever, both are valid? I choose ""begun"" for simplicity? Since it doesn\'t repeat E.\n\nSo guess: ""begun""\n\n<guess>begun</guess>Based on the feedback:\n- Guess 1 (""roast"") eliminated R, O, A, S, T.\n- Guess 2 (""medic"") shows E as correct in position 2 and eliminates M, D, I, C.\n- Excluded letters: R, O, A, S, T, M, D, I, C.\n- Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n- Secret word format: _ E _ _ _.\n\nTo maximize information from new letters, the next guess uses B, G, U, and N (common letters from the available pool) while fixing E in position 2. ""Begun"" is a valid 5-letter word that fits this structure and tests new vowels and consonants. It avoids reused or excluded letters.\n\n<guess>begun</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: roast -> FEEDBACK: R(x) O(x) A(x) S(x) T(x)\nGuess 2: medic -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(✓) D(x) I(x) C(x)\nGuess 3: begun -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(✓) G(x) U(x) N(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the following feedback:\n- From Guess 1 (roast): R, O, A, S, T are not in the word at all.\n- From Guess 2 (medic): M, D, I, C are not in the word. E is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).\n- From Guess 3 (begun): B, G, U, N are not in the word. E is again confirmed in position 2 (which we already knew).\n\nSo, the secret word has the second letter as E, and the following letters are excluded: R, O, A, S, T, M, D, I, C, B, G, U, N.\n\nNow, the available letters are: F, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nThe word structure is: _ E _ _ _\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word with E in the second position, using only the available letters.\n\nLet\'s list possible words:\n\n- We need to fill positions 1, 3, 4, 5 with letters from {F, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z}.\n\nCommon words that fit:\n- ""JEWEL"": But J is available, E is fixed, W is available, E again? But we don\'t know if E is repeated? However, we have to use available letters. But ""JEWEL"" has E at position 2 and 4? And L at the end. But we have to check if the letters are available: J, W, L are available? Yes. But note: we have not excluded E? But we know E is in the word at position 2, but we don\'t know if it appears again. However, in ""JEWEL"", we are using E at position 4? That might be acceptable? But we are trying to test new letters? Using E again might not give new information? But if the secret word has E at position 4, we get a hit? Otherwise, we know it\'s not there? But we have limited letters? Also, ""JEWEL"" has two E\'s? So we are testing J, W, L? And E at position 4? But we are allowed to use E? It\'s not excluded? But we are trying to cover as many new letters as possible? So using E again might be inefficient? But we have to form a valid word.\n\nAlternatively, avoid repeating E? But it might be hard? Because we have few vowels left? The available vowels are only Y? And sometimes W? But we have U? U is excluded? From ""begun"": U(x) -> excluded? So no U. Vowels available: only Y? And we have E already? So the word must have Y? Or no other vowels? But we can have words without vowels? But English words have vowels? So we need Y? Or we can have words with Y as vowel? Or we can use W? But W is consonant? So the only vowel available is Y? Because E is already used? And we cannot use A, I, O, U? They are excluded? So the secret word must have Y? Or it might have E repeated? But we don\'t know.\n\nTherefore, we should consider words that include Y? Because without Y, we might not have a vowel? But we have E at position 2? So the other positions can be consonants? But we need a vowel? Not necessarily? For example, ""myth"" has Y? But we need 5 letters? And position 2 is E? So the word must have E at position 2? And then other letters? But we can have words like ""DEBYE"" but D excluded? Not.\n\nSo let\'s think of words with Y? And E at position 2.\n\nFor example:\n- ""KEYED"": But E at position 2? K(1), E(2), Y(3), E(4), D(5) -> D excluded? Invalid.\n- ""JEY"" not 5 letters.\n- ""HEY"" not 5.\n\n""EYRIE"": E at position 1? Not position 2? We need position 2 E? So ""EYRIE"" is E,Y,R,I,E -> R and I excluded? Invalid.\n\n""LYCEE"": L,Y,C,E,E -> C excluded? Invalid.\n\n""PYGMY"": P,Y,G,M,Y -> G and M excluded? Invalid.\n\n""WHEYS"": W,H,E,Y,S -> S excluded? Invalid.\n\n""FJELD"": F,J,E,L,D -> D excluded? Invalid.\n\nThis is challenging.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the word has Y in it? And we use it? But we need a word with E at position 2 and Y somewhere.\n\nFor example: \n- ""LEVY"": not 5 letters.\n- ""LEERY"": L,E,E,R,Y -> R excluded? Invalid.\n- ""PEWIT"": P,E,W,I,T -> I and T excluded? Invalid.\n\nPerhaps we need to use Y in position 1,3,4, or 5? And E at 2.\n\nLet me list possible words from the available letters: F, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe need a word: [F/H/J/K/L/P/Q/V/W/X/Y/Z] E [F/H/J/K/L/P/Q/V/W/X/Y/Z] [F/H/J/K/L/P/Q/V/W/X/Y/Z] [F/H/J/K/L/P/Q/V/W/X/Y/Z]\n\nAnd it must be a valid English word.\n\nSome possibilities:\n- ""HELLO"": but O excluded? And L repeated? Also O excluded? Invalid.\n- ""JELLY"": J,E,L,L,Y -> but we have L repeated? And Y? Now, letters: J, L, Y are available? Yes. And E at position 2? So ""JELLY"" is J(1), E(2), L(3), L(4), Y(5). But L is repeated? We can do that? The word is valid? Yes. And it uses J, L, Y? But L twice? So we are testing J, L, Y? But L is tested twice? If L is not in the word, we get two x\'s? But if L is in the word, we might get one or two hits? But it\'s acceptable? But we are using one letter twice? Which means we are not testing as many new letters? But we have to form a word? So it might be necessary.\n\nAnother word: ""KEVEL"": K,E,V,E,L -> E repeated? And V, L? But E at position 2 and 4? So ""KEVEL"" is K(1),E(2),V(3),E(4),L(5). But we are using E twice? And V, L? But we know E at position 2? So we are testing K, V, L? And E at position 4? But again, we are repeating E? And we have only 4 new letters? But we are testing 3 new letters? Because E is repeated? So not efficient? But we have to.\n\nAnother: ""PEWEE"": P,E,W,E,E -> E repeated? And W? But P and W? But E at position 2,4,5? And we know position 2 E? So we are testing P, W? And E at 4 and 5? But only two new letters? Not good.\n\n""YELP"": not 5 letters.\n\n""YELPS"": Y,E,L,P,S -> S excluded? Invalid.\n\n""YEW"" not 5.\n\n""YEUKS"": Y,E,U,K,S -> U and S excluded? Invalid.\n\n""YEXES"": Y,E,X,E,S -> S excluded? Invalid.\n\n""YECCH"": Y,E,C,C,H -> C excluded? Invalid.\n\n""YE"": not 5.\n\n""KEEPS"": K,E,E,P,S -> S excluded? Invalid.\n\n""HEFTY"": H,E,F,T,Y -> T excluded? Invalid.\n\n""HELIX"": H,E,L,I,X -> I excluded? Invalid.\n\n""HELLY"": H,E,L,L,Y -> H, L, Y? And E at 2? So ""HELLY"" is a word? Meaning? I think it\'s a valid word (a type of boat or something)? But let\'s assume it\'s valid? Or ""JELLY"" is more common.\n\n""HELVE"": H,E,L,V,E -> E repeated? And V? But H, L, V? And E at 2 and 5? So ""HELVE"" is H(1),E(2),L(3),V(4),E(5). We are testing H, L, V? And E at position 5? But we are using E twice? So only three new letters? But we have to.\n\n""HEVEA"": H,E,V,E,A -> A excluded? Invalid.\n\n""HEXAD"": H,E,X,A,D -> A and D excluded? Invalid.\n\n""HEXED"": H,E,X,E,D -> D excluded? Invalid.\n\n""HEXER"": H,E,X,E,R -> R excluded? Invalid.\n\n""HEXYL"": H,E,X,Y,L -> H, X, Y, L? And E at 2? So ""HEXYL"" is a word? In chemistry? Valid? Yes. So H(1),E(2),X(3),Y(4),L(5). This uses H, X, Y, L? All new letters? And no repeats? Perfect? We are testing four new letters: H, X, Y, L.\n\nAnd it doesn\'t repeat E? So we get maximum information.\n\nIs ""HEXYL"" a valid word? Yes, it is a chemical term for a radical.\n\nSo we can use ""HEXYL"".\n\nAnother option: ""JEWEL"" we thought earlier? J,E,W,E,L -> but E repeated? And W, L? But ""HEXYL"" has no repeat and four new letters? Better.\n\n""KEXES"": K,E,X,E,S -> S excluded? Invalid.\n\n""LEVEE"": L,E,V,E,E -> E repeated? And V? But L and V? And we know E at 2? So not as good.\n\n""PEWIT"": has I? Invalid.\n\n""VEXED"": V,E,X,E,D -> D excluded? Invalid.\n\n""WEXED"": not common? And D? Invalid.\n\n""YELMS"": Y,E,L,M,S -> M and S excluded? Invalid.\n\nSo ""HEXYL"" seems a good choice.\n\nTherefore, we guess ""HEXYL"".\n\n<guess>hexyl</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n- **Guess 1: ""roast""** → All letters (R, O, A, S, T) are **absent** from the secret word.  \n- **Guess 2: ""medic""** → Only **E** is **correct and in position 2**.

The alphabet minus the excluded ones.\n\nExcluded: A, B, C, D, G, H, I, M, N, O, R, S, T, U, X, Y.\n\nSo available letters: F, J, K, P, Q, V, W, Z.\n\nBut note: we have three positions to fill: first, third, and fourth.\n\nThe word is: [1] E [3] [4] L\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word with the available letters: F, J, K, P, Q, V, W, Z.\n\nAlso, note that the word must be a valid English word.\n\nLet\'s try to find words that fit this pattern.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- We need a word of the form ? E ? ? L\n\nWith the middle two letters (positions 3 and 4) being from F, J, K, P, Q, V, W, Z, and the first letter also from that set.\n\nBut note: we have only 8 letters available, and we need to use three of them (one for first, one for third, one for fourth) without repetition? Not necessarily, but since we don\'t know about repetition, we can try without repetition first.\n\nList of available letters: F, J, K, P, Q, V, W, Z.\n\nNow, common words? Let\'s think:\n\n- ""JEWEL"": But we have E and L, but J is available? But ""JEWEL"" is J,E,W,E,L -> but position 4 is E? And we have E at position 2? Also, W is available. But the pattern is ? E ? ? L, so for ""JEWEL"": \n  Position 1: J, Position 2: E, Position 3: W, Position 4: E, Position 5: L.\n  But position 4 is E? And we know position 2 is E? So it has two E\'s? But is that allowed? Yes, but we don\'t know if the secret word has two E\'s. Also, in the available letters, E is not excluded? But we are allowed to use E? However, in the feedback so far, we only know about one E (at position 2). But in ""hexyl"", we didn\'t test E elsewhere? So it\'s possible.\n\nBut in ""JEWEL"", we are using E at position 4? That might be a good test? But note: the available letters for positions 3 and 4 should be from F,J,K,P,Q,V,W,Z? E is not in that set? Because E is not excluded, but we are not forced to use only the available set? We can use E? But we know E is in the word? So we can use it again? But in this case, we are trying to fill the positions with letters that might be in the word? But we have limited information.\n\nActually, we can use any letter that hasn\'t been excluded? But E is not excluded? We only know it\'s in position 2? It could be elsewhere? So we can use E in other positions? But in our available set, we didn\'t include E because we are focusing on new letters? But technically, E is still available to use? However, to maximize information, we might want to avoid reusing known letters? But in this case, we have to form a word? And we have few options.\n\nBut let\'s see: the available letters for new information are F,J,K,P,Q,V,W,Z? But E is known, so we can use it? But if we use E, we might not get new information? Unless we are testing if it appears again.\n\nBut in this pattern, we have to have a word that ends with L and has E at position 2? So let\'s list possible words.\n\nAnother word: ""LEVEL"": But L is at position 1 and 5? But we know position 5 is L? And position 2 is E? But ""LEVEL"" has E at position 2 and 4? And L at 1,3,5? But position 3 is V? But V is available? But let\'s see: \n  Position 1: L -> but we don\'t know if L is at position 1? And we have to use available letters? But L is not in the available set? Because L is now known to be in the word? But we are not excluding L? We can use it? But we know L is at position 5? So if we put L at position 1, it might be correct or not? But in ""hexyl"", we only tested L at position 5? So we don\'t know about other positions? But in ""hexyl"", L was at position 5 and correct? But we don\'t know if L is at other positions? So we can test? But we have to form a word.\n\nHowever, in ""LEVEL"", position 1 is L? And we have available letters? But L is not in the set {F,J,K,P,Q,V,W,Z}? Because we derived the available set as the letters not excluded? But L is not excluded? We only know it\'s in the word at position 5? So L is still available to use? But we are trying to test new letters? So it might be better to avoid L? Because we already know it\'s in the word? But we don\'t know if it appears twice? So we can test? But with few letters left, we might not need to.\n\nBut let\'s clarify: the excluded letters are only those marked (x) in feedback? So L is not excluded? We can use it? But we are trying to find the secret word? We know position 5 is L? So we don\'t need to test position 5? But for other positions, we can use L? But it might be inefficient? Because if we use L at position 1, and it\'s not in the word at position 1, we get feedback? But we have to form a valid word? So if necessary, we can.\n\nBut in this case, with the available letters F,J,K,P,Q,V,W,Z, we don\'t have L? So we cannot use L in positions 1,3,4? Because L is not in the available set? The available set is the letters that haven\'t been excluded? And L is not excluded? So we can use L? But we are focusing on the letters that are still possible for being in the word? But we know L is in the word? So it\'s not necessary to test it again? But we can use it to form words? However, to maximize information, we should use letters that we haven\'t tested? Which are F,J,K,P,Q,V,W,Z? And avoid E and L? Because we already know about them? But E and L are in the word? So we can use them? But if we use them, we might not get new information? For example, if we use E at position 4, we can find out if it\'s there? Similarly for L.\n\nBut let\'s try to find words that use only F,J,K,P,Q,V,W,Z for positions 1,3,4? And E at 2, L at 5? But that might be hard? Because we need a vowel? The only vowel we have is E? And we are using it at position 2? But positions 3 and 4 are consonants? So the word must be composed of consonants except for E? And L? But L is consonant? So positions 1,3,4 must be consonants? And we have F,J,K,P,Q,V,W,Z? All consonants? So it\'s possible? But we need a valid word.\n\nFor example:\n- ""JEWEL"": But position 4 is E? Not a consonant? And E is not in the available set? But we can use it? But let\'s see: if we use ""JEWEL"", then position 3 is W? Which is available? Position 4 is E? Which is known? But we are testing if E is at position 4? And position 1 is J? Available.\n\nBut ""JEWEL"" has two E\'s? And we are using E at position 4? That might be acceptable? But we are not using a new letter for position 4? We are using E? Which we already know? So we lose the chance to test a new letter? But we have to form a word? And we have few options.\n\nAnother word: ""KEVEL"": K,E,V,E,L -> but position 4 is E? Again.\n\n""PEWEL"": Not a word.\n\n""VOWEL"": V,O,W,E,L -> O excluded? Invalid.\n\n""JOWEL"": J,O,W,E,L -> O excluded.\n\n""FEWEL"": Not a word.\n\n""HEWEL"": H excluded.\n\nPerhaps words without E in the middle? \n\nFor example, ""JETEL"": Not a word.\n\n""KEXEL"": Not a word.\n\n""PEWEL"": Not a word.\n\n""QUEL"": Not 5 letters.\n\n""QUELL"": Q,U,E,L,L -> U excluded? And two L\'s? But U excluded.\n\n""BEVEL"": B excluded and E at 4.\n\nThis is difficult.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the word is ""JUMPS"" but U and S excluded.\n\nWe need to consider that the secret word might have repeated letters? But we don\'t know.\n\nPerhaps we can use a word that has E at 2, L at 5, and in between, use two of the available letters.\n\nFor example, ""JEP L"" not a word.\n\n""KEPL"": not 5.\n\n""REPEL"": R and E at 4? R excluded.\n\n""SEPAL"": S and A excluded.\n\n""TEPAL"": T and A excluded.\n\n""VEGEL"": V,E,G,E,L -> G excluded.\n\n""WEF L"" not a word.\n\n""ZEXEL"": Not a word.\n\nPerhaps ""FJELD"": F,J,E,L,D -> D excluded.\n\nI am considering using a word that has Y? But Y is excluded? From ""hexyl"": Y(x) -> absent? So we cannot use Y.\n\nSimilarly, all the excluded letters are out.\n\nAnother common word: ""LEVEL"" but we have L at position 1 and 3? And E at 2 and 4? But position 5 is L? So ""LEVEL"" is L,E,V,E,L.\n\nBut V is available? So if we guess ""LEVEL"", then:\n- Position 1: L -> we don\'t know if L is at position 1? But we know L is at position 5? So if we guess L at position 1, it might be correct or not? And position 3: V? Available? Position 4: E? We don\'t know.\n\nBut ""LEVEL"" uses L at position 1 and 3? And E at 4? So we are testing V? And also testing if L is at position 1 and 3? And if E is at position 4? But we have only one new letter: V? Because L and E are known? But we are testing their positions? So it might be acceptable? But we have other options?\n\nBut with the available letters, we can try ""VELL"": not 5.\n\nPerhaps ""PELL"": not 5.\n\nLet\'s list all possible words that fit the pattern ? E ? ? L and use only the available letters or known letters.\n\nBut known letters are E and L? And available new letters are F,J,K,P,Q,V,W,Z.\n\nSo the word must be composed of letters from {E, L, F, J, K, P, Q, V, W, Z}? But E and L are already in the word? So we can use them? But we are trying to find the secret word? We know E at 2 and L at 5? So positions 1,3,4 should be from F,J,K,P,Q,V,W,Z? Or possibly E or L? But if we use E or L, we are not testing new letters? So ideally, we use new letters.\n\nBut is there any word that has E at 2, L at 5, and positions 1,3,4 from F,J,K,P,Q,V,W,Z?\n\nFor example:\n- ""J E P L L"" -> not a word.\n- ""J E K L L"" -> not a word.\n- ""J E W L L"" -> not a word.\n- ""F E J L L"" -> not a word.\n- ""F E K L L"" -> not a word.\n- ""F E P L L"" -> not a word.\n- ""F E V L L"" -> not a word.\n- ""F E W L L"" -> not a word.\n- ""F E Z L L"" -> not a word.\n- ""K E J L L"" -> not a word.\n- ""K E F L L"" -> not a word.\n- ""K E P L L"" -> not a word.\n- ""K E V L L"" -> not a word.\n- ""K E W L L"" -> not a word.\n- ""K E Z L L"" -> not a word.\n- ""P E J L L"" -> not a word.\n- ""P E F L L"" -> not a word.\n- ""P E K L L"" -> not a word.\n- ""P E V L L"" -> not a word.\n- ""P E W L L"" -> not a word.\n- ""P E Z L L"" -> not a word.\n- ""Q E F L L"" -> not a word.\n- ""Q E J L L"" -> not a word.\n- ""Q E K L L"" -> not a word.\n- ""Q E P L L"" -> not a word.\n- ""Q E V L L"" -> not a word.\n- ""Q E W L L"" -> not a word.\n- ""Q E Z L L"" -> not a word.\n- ""V E F L L"" -> not a word.\n- ""V E J L L"" -> not a word.\n- ""V E K L L"" -> not a word.\n- ""V E P L L"" -> not a word.\n- ""V E W L L"" -> not a word.\n- ""V E Z L L"" -> not a word.\n- ""W E F L L"" -> not a word.\n- ""W E J L L"" -> not a word.\n- ""W E K L L"" -> not a word.\n- ""W E P L L"" -> not a word.\n- ""W E V L L"" -> not a word.\n- ""W E Z L L"" -> not a word.\n- ""Z E F L L"" -> not a word.\n- ""Z E J L L"" -> not a word.\n- ""Z E K L L"" -> not a word.\n- ""Z E P L L"" -> not a word.\n- ""Z E V L L"" -> not a word.\n- ""Z E W L L"" -> not a word.\n\nNone of these are words? Because they have two L\'s at the end? That\'s not typical.\n\nPerhaps with one L? But we have L at position 5? So position 4 is not L? So we need a letter at position 4.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the word has only one L? And we use different letters.\n\nFor example, ""J E W E L"" -> ""jewel"" which is a word? But position 4 is E? So we are using E at position 4? And W at position 3? And J at position 1? And L at position 5? And E at position 2.\n\nSo ""JEWEL"" is a valid word? Yes.\n\nAnd it uses J and W? Which are available? And E at position 4? Which is known? But we are testing if E is at position 4? And also testing J and W.\n\nSimilarly, ""V E X E L"" -> but X excluded? From ""hexyl"": X(x) -> absent? So we cannot use X.\n\n""K E Y E L"" -> Y excluded.\n\n""F E E B L"" -> B excluded.\n\nSo ""JEWEL"" seems to be a candidate.\n\nAnother word: ""P E E L"" -> not 5 letters.\n\n""PEELS"" -> S excluded.\n\n""KEELS"" -> S excluded.\n\n""VEELS"" -> S excluded and E at 4.\n\n""J E V E L"" -> ""JEVEL"" not a word.\n\n""J E P L E"" -> not L at position 5.\n\nWe need L at position 5.\n\nSo ""JEWEL"" is one option.\n\nAnother: ""F E L L"" -> not 5.\n\n""K E L L"" -> not 5.\n\n""P E L L"" -> not 5.\n\n""V E L L"" -> not 5.\n\n""W E L L"" -> not 5.\n\n""Z E L L"" -> not 5.\n\n""J E L L"" -> not 5.\n\nSo perhaps ""JEWEL"" is the only common word that fits? Or are there others?\n\n""HEWEL"" not a word.\n\n""NEWEL"": N excluded.\n\n""MEWEL"": M excluded.\n\n""TEWEL"": T excluded.\n\n""DEWEL"": D excluded.\n\n""REWEL"": R excluded.\n\nSo ""JEWEL"" seems to be the best bet.\n\nBut in ""JEWEL"", we are using E at position 4? Which is not a new letter? But we are testing if it is in the word at that position? And we are testing J and W? Which are new.\n\nAlso, from the available letters, we have to use some of them.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""JEWEL"".\n\nBut we have to make sure that J and W are not excluded? They are not in the excluded list.\n\nExcluded: A,B,C,D,G,H,I,M,N,O,R,S,T,U,X,Y\n\nSo J and W are available.\n\nSo guess ""jewel"".\n\nBut in the feedback for ""hexyl"", we have L at position 5 correct? So in ""jewel"", position 5 is L? Which is correct? Position 2 is E? Correct? Position 1: J, position 3: W, position 4: E.\n\nSo we will get feedback on J, W, and E at position 4.\n\nIf the secret word has E at position 4, we get a ✓ for that? Otherwise, if E is not at position 4, we get a - or x? But since E is in the word, if it\'s not at position 4, it would be marked with - (present but wrong position)? But we already have E at position 2? So if there is only one E, then position 4 would be x? But if there is another E, it would be - or ✓? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut anyway, it\'s a valid guess.\n\nPerhaps there is a word like ""F E C K L"" but C excluded.\n\nI think ""JEWEL"" is the best we can do.\n\nSo I\'ll go with that.\n\n<guess>jewel</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n- **Guess 1: ""roast""** → All letters (R, O, A, S, T) are **absent** from the secret word.  \n- **Guess 2: ""medic""** → Only **E** is **correct and in position 2**.

We have the feedback from five guesses:

1. ""roast"" -> R, O, A, S, T are absent.
2. ""medic"" -> M, D, I, C are absent; E is correct and in position 2.
3. ""begun"" -> B, G, U, N are absent; E is correct in position 2 (reaffirmed).
4. ""hexyl"" -> H, X, Y are absent; E is correct in position 2; L is correct in position 5.
5. ""jewel"" -> J, W are absent; E is correct in position 2; E is correct in position 4; L is correct in position 5.

Key insights:
- The secret word has E in position 2 and position 4, and L in position 5. So the pattern is: _ E _ E L
- We know the word ends with ""E L"", and the second letter is E, and the fourth letter is E.

From ""jewel"": 
- Position 1: J (x) -> absent
- Position 2: E (✓) -> correct
- Position 3: W (x) -> absent
- Position 4: E (✓) -> correct (so the fourth letter is E)
- Position 5: L (✓) -> correct (already known)

So the secret word is: ? E ? E L

And we have the following letters absent: 
From all guesses: R, O, A, S, T, M, D, I, C, B, G, U, N, H, X, Y, J, W.

Available letters: F, K, P, Q, V, Z. (and possibly others, but we have to check the alphabet)

Alphabet: A to Z. Excluded: A,B,C,D,G,H,I,J,M,N,O,R,S,T,U,W,X,Y. 
So available: E, F, K, L, P, Q, V, Z. 
But E and L are already in the word? We know E is at positions 2 and 4, and L at position 5. So for positions 1 and 3, we need to use letters from F, K, P, Q, V, Z? And we can also use E or L? But we are not sure if there are more E's or L's? However, we have to form a word.

But note: the word has two E's and one L? And we have positions 1 and 3 to fill.

The pattern: [1] E [3] E L

Available letters for positions 1 and 3: F, K, P, Q, V, Z. (since E and L are known, but we can use them if necessary? But we are trying to fill the unknown positions, so we should use new letters? But we have to form a valid word.)

We know the secret word has at least two E's and one L? But it might have more? But we don't know.

For position 1 and 3, we must use letters from the available set? But we can use E or L? But if we use E at position 1 or 3, it might be redundant? Because we already know two E's? Similarly for L.

But let's see what words fit the pattern ? E ? E L.

Common words: 
- ""LEVEL"": L,E,V,E,L -> but we have L at position 1 and 5? And E at 2 and 4? And V at 3. But in this case, position 3 is V? And position 1 is L? But we don't know if L is at position 1? And we have to check if V is available? V is available? But in ""LEVEL"", position 5 is L? Which we know? But we are testing position 1 and 3.

But in our pattern, we have ? E ? E L, so for ""LEVEL"": 
Position 1: L, position 2: E, position 3: V, position 4: E, position 5: L -> matches.

But we have not excluded L? So L could be at position 1? Similarly, V is available.

But we also have other possibilities.

Another word: ""REBEL"": R and E? R excluded? Invalid.

""SEWEL"": S and W excluded? Invalid.

""BEVEL"": B excluded? Invalid.

""HEXER"": H, X, R excluded? Invalid.

""JEWEL"": we tried, J and W excluded.

""NEWEL"": N excluded? Invalid.

""PEWEL"": not a word? Or rare.

""REVEL"": R excluded.

""TEKEL"": T excluded.

""VELLE"": not a word? ""Velle"" is not common.

""WELL"": not 5 letters.

""YELP"": not 5.

So ""LEVEL"" is a common word that fits: L E V E L.

But we have to check if L and V are available? 
- L: we know it's in the word at position 5, but we haven't tested it at other positions? So it could be at position 1? 
- V: available? Yes, not excluded.

Also, from the available letters, V is in the set.

But we have to consider: in ""LEVEL"", we are using L at position 1 and 3? But we only know L at position 5? So if we guess ""LEVEL"", we can find out about L at position 1 and 3? And V at position 3? But position 3 is V? And position 1 is L.

But we have only one guess left? We have made 5 guesses? So this is the 6th? We have to be careful.

Another word: ""FEUEL""? Not a word.

""KEVEL"": K,E,V,E,L -> which is K at position 1, E at 2, V at 3, E at 4, L at 5. This is also a valid word? Meaning a part of a ship? Or a tool.

Similarly, ""PEV L"" not.

""VE L E L"" not.

So possible words: ""LEVEL"" and ""KEVEL"".

Also, ""FEVER"": F,E,V,E,R -> R excluded? Invalid.

""LEGER"": L,E,G,E,R -> G and R excluded? Invalid.

""LEVER"": L,E,V,E,R -> R excluded? Invalid.

""SEVER"": S and R excluded.

So the only common words are ""LEVEL"" and ""KEVEL"".

Now, which one to choose?

We have to consider the available letters and the feedback.

In ""LEVEL"", we are using L at position 1 and 3? But we know L is at position 5? So if the secret word is ""LEVEL"", then L is at positions 1,3,5? But we don't know that? We only know position 5.

Similarly, in ""KEVEL"", we are using K at position 1 and V at position 3? Both new letters.

But we have to pick one.

Since we have no information about position 1 and 3, we can choose either.

But note: in ""jewel"", we got E at position 4 correct? So the secret word has E at position 4? And we know E at position 2? So two E's? And L at position 5.

Now, for ""LEVEL"": it has three L's? And one V? But we don't know if there are three L's? But it's possible.

Similarly, ""KEVEL"" has one K, one V, one E, one L? But two E's? And one L? But ""KEVEL"" has two E's? Positions: K(1), E(2), V(3), E(4), L(5) -> so two E's? And one L? But we know the secret word has at least two E's and one L? So it could have only one L? Or more? We don't know.

But in ""hexyl"", we had L at position 5? And in ""jewel"", we had L at position 5? But we never tested L elsewhere? So it could be that L is only at position 5? Or it could be elsewhere.

But in ""LEVEL"", if we guess it and it's correct, we win? If not, we get feedback.

Similarly for ""KEVEL"".

But we have only one guess left? So we have to choose one.

Let's see the available letters: F, K, P, Q, V, Z.

For position 1, it must be one of these? Or L? But L is not excluded? So it can be L? Or one of the available.

Similarly for position 3.

In ""LEVEL"", position 1 is L? Which is not in the available set? But we can use it? Because it's not excluded? But we are not sure if it's in the word at other positions? But we know it's in the word? So we can use it? But we are not testing a new letter? We are using a known letter? But we are testing its position.

In ""KEVEL"", we are testing two new letters: K and V.

But if we guess ""KEVEL"", and it's not the word, we might not get enough information? But we have only one guess? So we have to guess the word? Not for information? Because after this, we have no more guesses? So we must be correct.

Therefore, we need to guess the actual word.

So between ""LEVEL"" and ""KEVEL"", which is more common? Or more likely?

""LEVEL"" is a very common word? ""KEVEL"" is less common? But it is a valid word.

But in the context, we have to choose one.

Perhaps there are other words? Like ""PEELS""? But S excluded? And E at 4? But position 5 is L? So ""PEELS"" has S at the end? Not L? And S excluded.

""REELS"": R and S excluded.

""SEELS"": S excluded.

""TEELS"": T and S excluded.

""VEELS"": not common? And S? If it ends with L? ""VEEL"" not 5.

Another: ""F E L E L"" not a word.

""P E Z E L"" not a word.

""Q E V E L"" not a word.

""V E K E L"" not a word.

""Z E P E L"" not a word.

So only ""LEVEL"" and ""KEVEL"" are common enough.

But ""LEVEL"" has three L's? Which might be less common? But it is a word.

Perhaps ""BEVEL"" but B excluded.

I think both are possible? But let's see the feedback history.

We have not used V or K? So we don't know about them? But in ""LEVEL"", we are using V? And L at position 1 and 3.

But we know L is at position 5? So if the secret word is ""LEVEL"", then L is at 1,3,5? But we don't have evidence for that? But it's possible.

Similarly, for ""KEVEL"", it has K and V? Which are less common? But possible.

But we have to choose one.

Perhaps we can consider the frequency.

But I think ""LEVEL"" is more common? So I'll go with ""LEVEL"".

But let's confirm the pattern: ? E ? E L

""LEVEL"": L E V E L -> matches.

""KEVEL"": K E V E L -> matches.

Now, in the available letters, we have F, K, P, Q, V, Z? So for ""KEVEL"", K and V are available? For ""LEVEL"", L is not in the available set? But it is not excluded? So it can be used? But we are using it at position 1 and 3? Which is fine.

But we have no information about L at position 1 or 3? So it's a guess.

But since we have to guess, and ""LEVEL"" is a common word, I choose ""LEVEL"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""roast""** → All letters (R, O, A, S, T) **absent**.  
- **Guess 2: ""medic""** → Only **E** is **correct and in position 2**. Letters M, D, I, C **absent**.  
- **Guess 3: ""begun""** → Only **E** is **correct and in position 2** (reaffirmed). Letters B, G, U, N **absent**.  
- **Guess 4: ""hexyl""** → **E** is **correct in position 2**, **L** is **correct in position 5**, and H, X, Y **absent**.  
- **Guess 5: ""jewel""** → **E** is **correct in position 2**, **E** is **correct in position 4**, **L** is **correct in position 5**, and J, W **absent**.  

### Key Insights:
1. **Secret word structure**:  
   - Position 2: **E** (confirmed).  
   - Position 4: **E** (newly confirmed).  
   - Position 5: **L** (confirmed).  
   - Format: `_ E _ E L`  
2. **Excluded letters (18 total)**:  
   - From Guess 1: R, O, A, S, T.  
   - From Guess 2: M, D, I, C.  
   - From Guess 3: B, G, U, N.  
   - From Guess 4: H, X, Y.  
   - From Guess 5: J, W.  
3. **Available letters (8 remaining)**: F, K, P, Q, V, Z.  
4. **Constraints**:  
   - The word must start with a letter from the available set (F, K, P, Q, V, Z) or known letters (E, L).  
   - Position 3 must also use a letter from the available set or known letters.  
   - The word must be a valid English word matching `_ E _ E L`.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Final guess** (6th attempt) must solve the word.  
- **Possible valid words** fitting `_ E _ E L`:  
  - ""LEVEL"" (common word: L at positions 1, 3, 5; V at position 3).  
  - ""KEVEL"" (less common: K at position 1, V at position 3).  
- **Why ""LEVEL""?**  
  - Uses **V** (available letter) and **L** (known letter at position 5, tested at new positions 1 and 3).  
  - High-frequency word more likely than ""KEVEL"" (which uses rarer K).  
  - If correct, solves the puzzle; if incorrect, no more guesses remain, but feedback would be irrelevant.  

<guess>level</guess>",level,"We have the feedback from five guesses:

1. ""roast"" -> R, O, A, S, T are absent.
2. ""medic"" -> M, D, I, C are absent; E is correct and in position 2.
3. ""begun"" -> B, G, U, N are absent; E is correct in position 2 (reaffirmed).
4. ""hexyl"" -> H, X, Y are absent; E is correct in position 2; L is correct in position 5.
5. ""jewel"" -> J, W are absent; E is correct in position 2; E is correct in position 4; L is correct in position 5.

Key insights:
- The secret word has E in position 2 and position 4, and L in position 5. So the pattern is: _ E _ E L
- We know the word ends with ""E L"", and the second letter is E, and the fourth letter is E.

From ""jewel"": 
- Position 1: J (x) -> absent
- Position 2: E (✓) -> correct
- Position 3: W (x) -> absent
- Position 4: E (✓) -> correct (so the fourth letter is E)
- Position 5: L (✓) -> correct (already known)

So the secret word is: ? E ? E L

And we have the following letters absent: 
From all guesses: R, O, A, S, T, M, D, I, C, B, G, U, N, H, X, Y, J, W.

Available letters: F, K, P, Q, V, Z. (and possibly others, but we have to check the alphabet)

Alphabet: A to Z. Excluded: A,B,C,D,G,H,I,J,M,N,O,R,S,T,U,W,X,Y. 
So available: E, F, K, L, P, Q, V, Z. 
But E and L are already in the word? We know E is at positions 2 and 4, and L at position 5. So for positions 1 and 3, we need to use letters from F, K, P, Q, V, Z? And we can also use E or L? But we are not sure if there are more E's or L's? However, we have to form a word.

But note: the word has two E's and one L? And we have positions 1 and 3 to fill.

The pattern: [1] E [3] E L

Available letters for positions 1 and 3: F, K, P, Q, V, Z. (since E and L are known, but we can use them if necessary? But we are trying to fill the unknown positions, so we should use new letters? But we have to form a valid word.)

We know the secret word has at least two E's and one L? But it might have more? But we don't know.

For position 1 and 3, we must use letters from the available set? But we can use E or L? But if we use E at position 1 or 3, it might be redundant? Because we already know two E's? Similarly for L.

But let's see what words fit the pattern ? E ? E L.

Common words: 
- ""LEVEL"": L,E,V,E,L -> but we have L at position 1 and 5? And E at 2 and 4? And V at 3. But in this case, position 3 is V? And position 1 is L? But we don't know if L is at position 1? And we have to check if V is available? V is available? But in ""LEVEL"", position 5 is L? Which we know? But we are testing position 1 and 3.

But in our pattern, we have ? E ? E L, so for ""LEVEL"": 
Position 1: L, position 2: E, position 3: V, position 4: E, position 5: L -> matches.

But we have not excluded L? So L could be at position 1? Similarly, V is available.

But we also have other possibilities.

Another word: ""REBEL"": R and E? R excluded? Invalid.

""SEWEL"": S and W excluded? Invalid.

""BEVEL"": B excluded? Invalid.

""HEXER"": H, X, R excluded? Invalid.

""JEWEL"": we tried, J and W excluded.

""NEWEL"": N excluded? Invalid.

""PEWEL"": not a word? Or rare.

""REVEL"": R excluded.

""TEKEL"": T excluded.

""VELLE"": not a word? ""Velle"" is not common.

""WELL"": not 5 letters.

""YELP"": not 5.

So ""LEVEL"" is a common word that fits: L E V E L.

But we have to check if L and V are available? 
- L: we know it's in the word at position 5, but we haven't tested it at other positions? So it could be at position 1? 
- V: available? Yes, not excluded.

Also, from the available letters, V is in the set.

But we have to consider: in ""LEVEL"", we are using L at position 1 and 3? But we only know L at position 5? So if we guess ""LEVEL"", we can find out about L at position 1 and 3? And V at position 3? But position 3 is V? And position 1 is L.

But we have only one guess left? We have made 5 guesses? So this is the 6th? We have to be careful.

Another word: ""FEUEL""? Not a word.

""KEVEL"": K,E,V,E,L -> which is K at position 1, E at 2, V at 3, E at 4, L at 5. This is also a valid word? Meaning a part of a ship? Or a tool.

Similarly, ""PEV L"" not.

""VE L E L"" not.

So possible words: ""LEVEL"" and ""KEVEL"".

Also, ""FEVER"": F,E,V,E,R -> R excluded? Invalid.

""LEGER"": L,E,G,E,R -> G and R excluded? Invalid.

""LEVER"": L,E,V,E,R -> R excluded? Invalid.

""SEVER"": S and R excluded.

So the only common words are ""LEVEL"" and ""KEVEL"".

Now, which one to choose?

We have to consider the available letters and the feedback.

In ""LEVEL"", we are using L at position 1 and 3? But we know L is at position 5? So if the secret word is ""LEVEL"", then L is at positions 1,3,5? But we don't know that? We only know position 5.

Similarly, in ""KEVEL"", we are using K at position 1 and V at position 3? Both new letters.

But we have to pick one.

Since we have no information about position 1 and 3, we can choose either.

But note: in ""jewel"", we got E at position 4 correct? So the secret word has E at position 4? And we know E at position 2? So two E's? And L at position 5.

Now, for ""LEVEL"": it has three L's? And one V? But we don't know if there are three L's? But it's possible.

Similarly, ""KEVEL"" has one K, one V, one E, one L? But two E's? And one L? But ""KEVEL"" has two E's? Positions: K(1), E(2), V(3), E(4), L(5) -> so two E's? And one L? But we know the secret word has at least two E's and one L? So it could have only one L? Or more? We don't know.

But in ""hexyl"", we had L at position 5? And in ""jewel"", we had L at position 5? But we never tested L elsewhere? So it could be that L is only at position 5? Or it could be elsewhere.

But in ""LEVEL"", if we guess it and it's correct, we win? If not, we get feedback.

Similarly for ""KEVEL"".

But we have only one guess left? So we have to choose one.

Let's see the available letters: F, K, P, Q, V, Z.

For position 1, it must be one of these? Or L? But L is not excluded? So it can be L? Or one of the available.

Similarly for position 3.

In ""LEVEL"", position 1 is L? Which is not in the available set? But we can use it? Because it's not excluded? But we are not sure if it's in the word at other positions? But we know it's in the word? So we can use it? But we are not testing a new letter? We are using a known letter? But we are testing its position.

In ""KEVEL"", we are testing two new letters: K and V.

But if we guess ""KEVEL"", and it's not the word, we might not get enough information? But we have only one guess? So we have to guess the word? Not for information? Because after this, we have no more guesses? So we must be correct.

Therefore, we need to guess the actual word.

So between ""LEVEL"" and ""KEVEL"", which is more common? Or more likely?

""LEVEL"" is a very common word? ""KEVEL"" is less common? But it is a valid word.

But in the context, we have to choose one.

Perhaps there are other words? Like ""PEELS""? But S excluded? And E at 4? But position 5 is L? So ""PEELS"" has S at the end? Not L? And S excluded.

""REELS"": R and S excluded.

""SEELS"": S excluded.

""TEELS"": T and S excluded.

""VEELS"": not common? And S? If it ends with L? ""VEEL"" not 5.

Another: ""F E L E L"" not a word.

""P E Z E L"" not a word.

""Q E V E L"" not a word.

""V E K E L"" not a word.

""Z E P E L"" not a word.

So only ""LEVEL"" and ""KEVEL"" are common enough.

But ""LEVEL"" has three L's? Which might be less common? But it is a word.

Perhaps ""BEVEL"" but B excluded.

I think both are possible? But let's see the feedback history.

We have not used V or K? So we don't know about them? But in ""LEVEL"", we are using V? And L at position 1 and 3.

But we know L is at position 5? So if the secret word is ""LEVEL"", then L is at 1,3,5? But we don't have evidence for that? But it's possible.

Similarly, for ""KEVEL"", it has K and V? Which are less common? But possible.

But we have no information about L at position 1 or 3? So it's a guess.

But since we have to guess, and ""LEVEL"" is a common word, I choose ""LEVEL"".
