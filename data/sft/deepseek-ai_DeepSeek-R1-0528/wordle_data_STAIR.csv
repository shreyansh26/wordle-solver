We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: - (in the word but wrong position)
  A: ✓ (correct position)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

 So, from this we know:
  - The letter 'A' is in the word and is in the 3rd position (since it was the third letter and got a check).
  - The letter 'R' is in the word, but not in the second position (because we had it in the second position and got a dash).
  - The letters 'C', 'N', and 'E' are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word:
  - Must have an 'A' in the third position: _ _ A _ _
  - Must contain an 'R', but not in the second position. So R can be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: position 3 is already A, so R cannot be there. So R must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
  - Does not contain C, N, E.

 We also know that the word is 5 letters.

 For our next guess, we want to try to find a word that:
  - Has 'A' in the third position.
  - Includes the letter 'R' (but not in the second position) and possibly other common letters that we haven't tried yet.
  - Avoids the letters C, N, E.

 We also want to test other positions to get more information.

 Let's think of common letters that we haven't used: we have used C, R, A, N, E. So we can try letters like S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, H, etc.

 We know the word has an R and an A. So let's try to include R in a position that we haven't ruled out (position 1, 4, or 5) and also include some new letters.

 We can also consider that the word might have other common letters.

 Let's try to form a word that fits:
  Pattern: _ _ A _ _

 We can try putting R at the beginning? So R _ A _ _
 But note: we don't know if R is at the beginning. We can try.

 Alternatively, we can try putting R at the end: _ _ A _ R

 But we don't have to fix R in this guess? Actually, we want to test multiple possibilities.

 However, we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.

 Let's think of words that have the form _ _ A _ _ and contain R and avoid C, N, E.

 Some possibilities:
  - ""TRACK"": but has C and K? We know C is not in the word, so we avoid C. Also, we don't know about K? But we can avoid because we know C is out.
  - ""TRAMP"": has T, R, A, M, P. But note: we have to avoid using known absent letters? We don't know about T, M, P. Also, R is in the second position? But we have to avoid putting R in the second position because we already tried that and it was wrong? Actually, in the first guess we had R in the second position and it was wrong (dash meaning present but wrong position). So we cannot put R in the second position again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not there. So better to put R in a new position.

 Let me list words that have R and A (with A in the third position) and without C, N, E.

 Possibilities:
  - ""GRABS"": G, R, A, B, S -> pattern: G R A B S -> but R is in the second position? We know R is not in the second position? Actually, the feedback for the first guess said R was in the word but not in the second position. So we should avoid putting R in the second position in this guess? Because we know it's not there. So we can try R in a different position.

  We can try:
    - R in the first position: R _ A _ _
    - R in the fourth position: _ _ A R _
    - R in the fifth position: _ _ A _ R

 Let's think of words for each:

  R _ A _ _ : 
    - ""RABAT""? Not common.
    - ""RADAR"": has D and R at the end? But note: we have two R's? The word might have duplicate letters? We don't know. But in the feedback, we only saw one R? Actually, the feedback for the first guess only had one R and it was marked as present. So the word has at least one R. It might have two? But we don't know.

  However, we also have to avoid C, N, E.

  Let me try to think of common words:

    R _ A _ _ : 
      - ""RADAR"": but has two R's? And the last letter is R. Also, it has D and A. But we don't know about D. However, we are avoiding C, N, E. So it's okay? But we want to test new letters.

    Another: ""RAPID"": has P, I, D. But we don't know about these.

  But note: we also want to test other common letters to get more information.

  Alternatively, we can try a word that has R in the fourth position: _ _ A R _

    Examples: 
      - ""STARE"": but we know E is not in the word? So we cannot use E.
      - ""SCARF"": has C? We know C is not in the word.
      - ""SHARK"": has S, H, A, R, K -> pattern: S H A R K -> but we have A in the third, and R in the fourth? That fits. And avoids C, N, E.

  Or R in the fifth: _ _ A _ R
    - ""SONAR"": has S, O, N, A, R -> but N is not in the word? We know N is absent. So we cannot use N.

  So let's consider ""SHARK"": 
    - S, H, A, R, K -> A is in the third, R in the fourth? 
    - We haven't tried S, H, K.

  But note: we are not sure if R is in the fourth position. We are testing.

  Alternatively, we can try a word that has R in the first position and also includes other common letters.

  Another idea: we can try to use a word that has multiple new letters to test.

  Let me think of a word that has:
    - A in the third position.
    - R in a new position (not second) and not in the third (because third is A).
    - And includes other common consonants and vowels that we haven't tried (like S, T, L, I, O, etc.) but avoiding C, N, E.

  Example: ""TRAIL"": 
    - T, R, A, I, L -> pattern: T R A I L -> but R is in the second position? We know R is not in the second position. So we cannot use that.

  How about ""PARTY"": 
    - P, A, R, T, Y -> pattern: P A R T Y -> but wait, we need A in the third? This has A in the second? So no.

  We need A in the third. So the word must be: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4] [letter5]

  How about ""DRAWL"": 
    - D, R, A, W, L -> pattern: D R A W L -> R is in the second position? Again, we know R is not in the second.

  So avoid second position for R.

  Let me try R in the first: 
    ""R"" as first: R [not second?] so the second letter must not be R? But we can have any letter in the second? But we know R is not in the second, so that's fine.

    Words: 
      - ""RABID"": has B, I, D -> but we don't know about these. However, we avoid E, C, N? It has no E, C, N. But note: we have to avoid E? Yes. But it has I and D? We haven't tried them.

      - ""RADII"": not common.

      - ""RALLY"": has L, L, Y -> but we have two L's? And we don't know about L and Y. Also, R is first, then A is third? Actually, ""RALLY"" is R A L L Y -> so the third letter is L, not A? So no.

  We need the third letter to be A.

  So: R _ A _ _

  Examples: 
    - ""RATIO"": but has T, I, O -> but the pattern: R A T I O -> wait, that's R in first, A in second? We need A in third. So no.

    - ""REACT"": has E and C? We know E and C are not in the word.

    - ""ROAST"": has O, S, T -> pattern: R O A S T -> that's R in first, O in second, A in third, S in fourth, T in fifth. This fits: R _ A _ _ -> with O, S, T. And we avoid C, N, E? Yes.

  But wait, we know E is not in the word? So ""ROAST"" is okay? It doesn't have E, C, N.

  However, we have already tried R in the first position? Actually, we haven't. We tried R in the second position in the first guess. Now we are trying R in the first.

  But note: the feedback said R is in the word but not in the second position. So it could be in the first? We don't know. So we can test.

  Alternatively, we can try a word that has R in the fourth or fifth and also tests other common letters.

  Let me consider ""ROAST"": 
    - It uses R, O, A, S, T. We know A is in the third. We are testing R in the first, O in the second, S in the fourth, T in the fifth.

  But we also want to test more letters? We have already used R, A, and now we are adding O, S, T.

  Another option: ""SHARP"": 
    - S, H, A, R, P -> pattern: S H A R P -> so A in third, R in fourth? This avoids C, N, E.

  We can also consider ""STAIR"": but has I and R? Pattern: S T A I R -> but we know T? We haven't tried T. But note: we have to avoid E? Yes. However, we don't know about T. But wait, in the first guess we didn't have T. So we can use.

  But ""STAIR"" has T in the second? And we are testing R at the end? Also, we are testing S and T and I.

  However, we have a constraint: we know the word has an R. So both ""ROAST"" and ""SHARP"" and ""STAIR"" are valid.

  But we also want to maximize the chance of getting more feedback on other letters.

  Let me compare:

    ""ROAST"": tests R (first), O (second), A (third, known), S (fourth), T (fifth). 
    ""SHARP"": tests S (first), H (second), A (third, known), R (fourth), P (fifth).
    ""STAIR"": tests S (first), T (second), A (third, known), I (fourth), R (fifth).

  We haven't tried any of the letters in these words except R and A. So all are good.

  But note: we know the word has an R, so if we put R in a position we haven't tried, we might get a dash or a check.

  How about we choose a word that has R in a position that we haven't tried and also includes as many new common letters as possible.

  The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. But we know E and N are out. So we can try T, O, I, S, H, R (already known), D, L, U.

  We want to test as many of these as possible.

  ""ROAST"": has R, O, A, S, T -> 5 distinct: R, O, A, S, T -> and we know A and R are in the word (R is known to be present). So we are testing O, S, T.

  ""SHARP"": has S, H, A, R, P -> testing S, H, P.

  ""STAIR"": has S, T, A, I, R -> testing S, T, I.

  Since T and S are very common, I think ""ROAST"" or ""STAIR"" are good.

  But note: we have to avoid the second position for R? Yes, so we are not putting R in the second.

  Let me choose ""ROAST"" because it tests O and T as well.

  So our next guess: ""ROAST""

  But wait, we have to make sure that the word doesn't have any of the absent letters? We know it doesn't have C, N, E. ""ROAST"" doesn't have these.

  So let's go with ""ROAST"".

  However, note that the word might have duplicate letters? We don't know. But ""ROAST"" has unique letters.

  Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have R in the second position and has A in the third, and uses more new letters.

  Another word: ""TRAIN"" -> but has N? We know N is absent. So no.

  ""PLAIT"": has P, L, A, I, T -> pattern: P L A I T -> but we don't have R? We know the word has R, so we must include R? Because we are trying to find the word and we know it has R. So we must include R in our guess to get information about its position.

  Therefore, we must include R.

  So I think ""ROAST"" is a good choice.

  Let me check if ""ROAST"" is a valid word? Yes.

  So we'll guess ""ROAST"".

  But note: we are not sure if R is in the first position. We are testing.

  If we get:
    - If R is in the first, we might get a check? Or if it's not, we might get a dash? Or if it's not in the word at all? But we know R is in the word, so it must be either a dash or a check.

  Similarly for the other letters.

  We are also testing O, S, T.

  So let's go with ""ROAST"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- ""A"" is confirmed in the correct position (3rd letter).
- ""R"" is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
- ""C"", ""N"", and ""E"" are absent.

For the next guess:
- Must include ""R"" (avoiding the 2nd position).
- Must have ""A"" in the 3rd position.
- Avoid ""C"", ""N"", ""E"".
- Test new common letters (e.g., S, T, O) to gather more information.

""roast"" fits these criteria:
- Places ""A"" in the 3rd position.
- Places ""R"" in the 1st position (a new position to test).
- Introduces new letters: O (2nd), S (4th), T (5th).
- Avoids invalid letters (C, N, E).

<guess>roast</guess>",roast,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: - (in the word but wrong position)
  A: ✓ (correct position)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

 So, from this we know:
  - The letter 'A' is in the word and is in the 3rd position (since it was the third letter and got a check).
  - The letter 'R' is in the word, but not in the second position (because we had it in the second position and got a dash).

  Examples: 
    - ""RATIO"": but has T, I, O -> but the pattern: R A T I O -> wait, that's R in first, A in second? We need A in third. So no.

    - ""REACT"": has E and C? We know E and C are not in the word.

    - ""ROAST"": has O, S, T -> pattern: R O A S T -> that's R in first, O in second, A in third, S in fourth, T in fifth. This fits: R _ A _ _ -> with O, S, T. And we avoid C, N, E? Yes.

  But wait, we know E is not in the word? So ""ROAST"" is okay? It doesn't have E, C, N.

  However, we have already tried R in the first position? Actually, we haven't. We tried R in the second position in the first guess. Now we are trying R in the first.

  But note: the feedback said R is in the word but not in the second position. So it could be in the first? We don't know. So we can test.

  Alternatively, we can try a word that has R in the fourth or fifth and also tests other common letters.

  Let me consider ""ROAST"": 
    - It uses R, O, A, S, T. We know A is in the third. We are testing R in the first, O in the second, S in the fourth, T in the fifth.

  But we also want to test more letters? We have already used R, A, and now we are adding O, S, T.

  Another option: ""SHARP"": 
    - S, H, A, R, P -> pattern: S H A R P -> so A in third, R in fourth? This avoids C, N, E.

  We can also consider ""STAIR"": but has I and R? Pattern: S T A I R -> but we know T? We haven't tried T. But note: we have to avoid E? Yes. However, we don't know about T. But wait, in the first guess we didn't have T. So we can use.

  But ""STAIR"" has T in the second? And we are testing R at the end? Also, we are testing S and T and I.

  However, we have a constraint: we know the word has an R. So both ""ROAST"" and ""SHARP"" and ""STAIR"" are valid.

  But we also want to maximize the chance of getting more feedback on other letters.

  Let me compare:

    ""ROAST"": tests R (first), O (second), A (third, known), S (fourth), T (fifth). 
    ""SHARP"": tests S (first), H (second), A (third, known), R (fourth), P (fifth).
    ""STAIR"": tests S (first), T (second), A (third, known), I (fourth), R (fifth).

  We haven't tried any of the letters in these words except R and A. So all are good.

  But note: we know the word has an R, so if we put R in a position we haven't tried, we might get a dash or a check.

  How about we choose a word that has R in a position that we haven't tried and also includes as many new common letters as possible.

  The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. But we know E and N are out. So we can try T, O, I, S, H, R (already known), D, L, U.

  We want to test as many of these as possible.

  ""ROAST"": has R, O, A, S, T -> 5 distinct: R, O, A, S, T -> and we know A and R are in the word (R is known to be present). So we are testing O, S, T.

  ""SHARP"": has S, H, A, R, P -> testing S, H, P.

  ""STAIR"": has S, T, A, I, R -> testing S, T, I.

  Since T and S are very common, I think ""ROAST"" or ""STAIR"" are good.

  But note: we have to avoid the second position for R? Yes, so we are not putting R in the second.

  Let me choose ""ROAST"" because it tests O and T as well.

  So our next guess: ""ROAST""

  But wait, we have to make sure that the word doesn't have any of the absent letters? We know it doesn't have C, N, E. ""ROAST"" doesn't have these.

  So let's go with ""ROAST"".

  However, note that the word might have duplicate letters? We don't know. But ""ROAST"" has unique letters.

  Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have R in the second position and has A in the third, and uses more new letters.

  Another word: ""TRAIN"" -> but has N? We know N is absent. So no.

  ""PLAIT"": has P, L, A, I, T -> pattern: P L A I T -> but we don't have R? We know the word has R, so we must include R? Because we are trying to find the word and we know it has R. So we must include R in our guess to get information about its position.

  Therefore, we must include R.

  So I think ""ROAST"" is a good choice.

  Let me check if ""ROAST"" is a valid word? Yes.

  So we'll guess ""ROAST"".

  But note: we are not sure if R is in the first position. We are testing.

  If we get:
    - If R is in the first, we might get a check? Or if it's not, we might get a dash? Or if it's not in the word at all? But we know R is in the word, so it must be either a dash or a check.

  Similarly for the other letters.

  We are also testing O, S, T.

  So let's go with ""ROAST"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- ""A"" is confirmed in the correct position (3rd letter).
- ""R"" is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
- ""C"", ""N"", and ""E"" are absent.

For the next guess:
- Must include ""R"" (avoiding the 2nd position).
- Must have ""A"" in the 3rd position.
- Avoid ""C"", ""N"", ""E"".
- Test new common letters (e.g., S, T, O) to gather more information.

""roast"" fits these criteria:
- Places ""A"" in the 3rd position.
- Places ""R"" in the 1st position (a new position to test).
- Introduces new letters: O (2nd), S (4th), T (5th).
- Avoids invalid letters (C, N, E).",Guess 2: roast -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) A(✓) S(-) T(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,STAIR,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: - (in the word but wrong position)
  A: ✓ (correct position)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

 So, from this we know:
  - The letter 'A' is in the word and is in the 3rd position (since it was the third letter and got a check).
  - The letter 'R' is in the word, but not in the second position (because we had it in the second position and got a dash).
  - The letters 'C', 'N', and 'E' are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word:
  - Must have an 'A' in the third position: _ _ A _ _
  - Must contain an 'R', but not in the second position. So R can be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: position 3 is already A, so R cannot be there. So R must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
  - Does not contain C, N, E.

 We also know that the word is 5 letters.

 For our next guess, we want to try to find a word that:
  - Has 'A' in the third position.
  - Includes the letter 'R' (but not in the second position) and possibly other common letters that we haven't tried yet.
  - Avoids the letters C, N, E.

 We also want to test other positions to get more information.

 Let's think of common letters that we haven't used: we have used C, R, A, N, E. So we can try letters like S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, H, etc.

 We know the word has an R and an A. So let's try to include R in a position that we haven't ruled out (position 1, 4, or 5) and also include some new letters.

 We can also consider that the word might have other common letters.

 Let's try to form a word that fits:
  Pattern: _ _ A _ _

 We can try putting R at the beginning? So R _ A _ _
 But note: we don't know if R is at the beginning. We can try.

 Alternatively, we can try putting R at the end: _ _ A _ R

 But we don't have to fix R in this guess? Actually, we want to test multiple possibilities.

 However, we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.

 Let's think of words that have the form _ _ A _ _ and contain R and avoid C, N, E.

 Some possibilities:
  - ""TRACK"": but has C and K? We know C is not in the word, so we avoid C. Also, we don't know about K? But we can avoid because we know C is out.
  - ""TRAMP"": has T, R, A, M, P. But note: we have to avoid using known absent letters? We don't know about T, M, P. Also, R is in the second position? But we have to avoid putting R in the second position because we already tried that and it was wrong? Actually, in the first guess we had R in the second position and it was wrong (dash meaning present but wrong position). So we cannot put R in the second position again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not there. So better to put R in a new position.

 Let me list words that have R and A (with A in the third position) and without C, N, E.

 Possibilities:
  - ""GRABS"": G, R, A, B, S -> pattern: G R A B S -> but R is in the second position? We know R is not in the second position? Actually, the feedback for the first guess said R was in the word but not in the second position. So we should avoid putting R in the second position in this guess? Because we know it's not there. So we can try R in a different position.

  We can try:
    - R in the first position: R _ A _ _
    - R in the fourth position: _ _ A R _
    - R in the fifth position: _ _ A _ R

 Let's think of words for each:

  R _ A _ _ : 
    - ""RABAT""? Not common.
    - ""RADAR"": has D and R at the end? But note: we have two R's? The word might have duplicate letters? We don't know. But in the feedback, we only saw one R? Actually, the feedback for the first guess only had one R and it was marked as present. So the word has at least one R. It might have two? But we don't know.

  However, we also have to avoid C, N, E.

  Let me try to think of common words:

    R _ A _ _ : 
      - ""RADAR"": but has two R's? And the last letter is R. Also, it has D and A. But we don't know about D. However, we are avoiding C, N, E. So it's okay? But we want to test new letters.

    Another: ""RAPID"": has P, I, D. But we don't know about these.

  But note: we also want to test other common letters to get more information.

  Alternatively, we can try a word that has R in the fourth position: _ _ A R _

    Examples: 
      - ""STARE"": but we know E is not in the word? So we cannot use E.
      - ""SCARF"": has C? We know C is not in the word.
      - ""SHARK"": has S, H, A, R, K -> pattern: S H A R K -> but we have A in the third, and R in the fourth? That fits. And avoids C, N, E.

  Or R in the fifth: _ _ A _ R
    - ""SONAR"": has S, O, N, A, R -> but N is not in the word? We know N is absent. So we cannot use N.

  So let's consider ""SHARK"": 
    - S, H, A, R, K -> A is in the third, R in the fourth? 
    - We haven't tried S, H, K.

  But note: we are not sure if R is in the fourth position. We are testing.

  Alternatively, we can try a word that has R in the first position and also includes other common letters.

  Another idea: we can try to use a word that has multiple new letters to test.

  Let me think of a word that has:
    - A in the third position.
    - R in a new position (not second) and not in the third (because third is A).
    - And includes other common consonants and vowels that we haven't tried (like S, T, L, I, O, etc.) but avoiding C, N, E.

  Example: ""TRAIL"": 
    - T, R, A, I, L -> pattern: T R A I L -> but R is in the second position? We know R is not in the second position. So we cannot use that.

  How about ""PARTY"": 
    - P, A, R, T, Y -> pattern: P A R T Y -> but wait, we need A in the third? This has A in the second? So no.

  We need A in the third. So the word must be: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4] [letter5]

  How about ""DRAWL"": 
    - D, R, A, W, L -> pattern: D R A W L -> R is in the second position? Again, we know R is not in the second.

  So avoid second position for R.

  Let me try R in the first: 
    ""R"" as first: R [not second?] so the second letter must not be R? But we can have any letter in the second? But we know R is not in the second, so that's fine.

    Words: 
      - ""RABID"": has B, I, D -> but we don't know about these. However, we avoid E, C, N? It has no E, C, N. But note: we have to avoid E? Yes. But it has I and D? We haven't tried them.

      - ""RADII"": not common.

      - ""RALLY"": has L, L, Y -> but we have two L's? And we don't know about L and Y. Also, R is first, then A is third? Actually, ""RALLY"" is R A L L Y -> so the third letter is L, not A? So no.

  We need the third letter to be A.

  So: R _ A _ _

  Examples: 
    - ""RATIO"": but has T, I, O -> but the pattern: R A T I O -> wait, that's R in first, A in second? We need A in third. So no.

    - ""REACT"": has E and C? We know E and C are not in the word.

    - ""ROAST"": has O, S, T -> pattern: R O A S T -> that's R in first, O in second, A in third, S in fourth, T in fifth. This fits: R _ A _ _ -> with O, S, T. And we avoid C, N, E? Yes.

  But wait, we know E is not in the word? So ""ROAST"" is okay? It doesn't have E, C, N.

  However, we have already tried R in the first position? Actually, we haven't. We tried R in the second position in the first guess. Now we are trying R in the first.

  But note: the feedback said R is in the word but not in the second position. So it could be in the first? We don't know. So we can test.

  Alternatively, we can try a word that has R in the fourth or fifth and also tests other common letters.

  Let me consider ""ROAST"": 
    - It uses R, O, A, S, T. We know A is in the third. We are testing R in the first, O in the second, S in the fourth, T in the fifth.

  But we also want to test more letters? We have already used R, A, and now we are adding O, S, T.

  Another option: ""SHARP"": 
    - S, H, A, R, P -> pattern: S H A R P -> so A in third, R in fourth? This avoids C, N, E.

  We can also consider ""STAIR"": but has I and R? Pattern: S T A I R -> but we know T? We haven't tried T. But note: we have to avoid E? Yes. However, we don't know about T. But wait, in the first guess we didn't have T. So we can use.

  But ""STAIR"" has T in the second? And we are testing R at the end? Also, we are testing S and T and I.

  However, we have a constraint: we know the word has an R. So both ""ROAST"" and ""SHARP"" and ""STAIR"" are valid.

  But we also want to maximize the chance of getting more feedback on other letters.

  Let me compare:

    ""ROAST"": tests R (first), O (second), A (third, known), S (fourth), T (fifth). 
    ""SHARP"": tests S (first), H (second), A (third, known), R (fourth), P (fifth).
    ""STAIR"": tests S (first), T (second), A (third, known), I (fourth), R (fifth).

  We haven't tried any of the letters in these words except R and A. So all are good.

  But note: we know the word has an R, so if we put R in a position we haven't tried, we might get a dash or a check.

  How about we choose a word that has R in a position that we haven't tried and also includes as many new common letters as possible.

  The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. But we know E and N are out. So we can try T, O, I, S, H, R (already known), D, L, U.

  We want to test as many of these as possible.

  ""ROAST"": has R, O, A, S, T -> 5 distinct: R, O, A, S, T -> and we know A and R are in the word (R is known to be present). So we are testing O, S, T.

  ""SHARP"": has S, H, A, R, P -> testing S, H, P.

  ""STAIR"": has S, T, A, I, R -> testing S, T, I.

  Since T and S are very common, I think ""ROAST"" or ""STAIR"" are good.

  But note: we have to avoid the second position for R? Yes, so we are not putting R in the second.

  Let me choose ""ROAST"" because it tests O and T as well.

  So our next guess: ""ROAST""

  But wait, we have to make sure that the word doesn't have any of the absent letters? We know it doesn't have C, N, E. ""ROAST"" doesn't have these.

  So let's go with ""ROAST"".

  However, note that the word might have duplicate letters? We don't know. But ""ROAST"" has unique letters.

  Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have R in the second position and has A in the third, and uses more new letters.

  Another word: ""TRAIN"" -> but has N? We know N is absent. So no.

  ""PLAIT"": has P, L, A, I, T -> pattern: P L A I T -> but we don't have R? We know the word has R, so we must include R? Because we are trying to find the word and we know it has R. So we must include R in our guess to get information about its position.

  Therefore, we must include R.

  So I think ""ROAST"" is a good choice.

  Let me check if ""ROAST"" is a valid word? Yes.

  So we'll guess ""ROAST"".

  But note: we are not sure if R is in the first position. We are testing.

  If we get:
    - If R is in the first, we might get a check? Or if it's not, we might get a dash? Or if it's not in the word at all? But we know R is in the word, so it must be either a dash or a check.

  Similarly for the other letters.

  We are also testing O, S, T.

  So let's go with ""ROAST"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- ""A"" is confirmed in the correct position (3rd letter).
- ""R"" is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
- ""C"", ""N"", and ""E"" are absent.

For the next guess:
- Must include ""R"" (avoiding the 2nd position).
- Must have ""A"" in the 3rd position.
- Avoid ""C"", ""N"", ""E"".
- Test new common letters (e.g., S, T, O) to gather more information.

""roast"" fits these criteria:
- Places ""A"" in the 3rd position.
- Places ""R"" in the 1st position (a new position to test).
- Introduces new letters: O (2nd), S (4th), T (5th).
- Avoids invalid letters (C, N, E).

But we don\'t know about these.\n\n  But note: we also want to test other common letters to get more information.\n\n  Alternatively, we can try a word that has R in the fourth position: _ _ A R _\n\n    Examples: \n      - ""STARE"": but we know E is not in the word? So we cannot use E.\n      - ""SCARF"": has C? We know C is not in the word.\n      - ""SHARK"": has S, H, A, R, K -> pattern: S H A R K -> but we have A in the third, and R in the fourth? That fits. And avoids C, N, E.\n\n  Or R in the fifth: _ _ A _ R\n    - ""SONAR"": has S, O, N, A, R -> but N is not in the word? We know N is absent. So we cannot use N.\n\n  So let\'s consider ""SHARK"": \n    - S, H, A, R, K -> A is in the third, R in the fourth? \n    - We haven\'t tried S, H, K.\n\n  But note: we are not sure if R is in the fourth position. We are testing.\n\n  Alternatively, we can try a word that has R in the first position and also includes other common letters.\n\n  Another idea: we can try to use a word that has multiple new letters to test.\n\n  Let me think of a word that has:\n    - A in the third position.\n    - R in a new position (not second) and not in the third (because third is A).\n    - And includes other common consonants and vowels that we haven\'t tried (like S, T, L, I, O, etc.) but avoiding C, N, E.\n\n  Example: ""TRAIL"": \n    - T, R, A, I, L -> pattern: T R A I L -> but R is in the second position? We know R is not in the second position. So we cannot use that.\n\n  How about ""PARTY"": \n    - P, A, R, T, Y -> pattern: P A R T Y -> but wait, we need A in the third? This has A in the second? So no.\n\n  We need A in the third. So the word must be: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4] [letter5]\n\n  How about ""DRAWL"": \n    - D, R, A, W, L -> pattern: D R A W L -> R is in the second position? Again, we know R is not in the second.\n\n  So avoid second position for R.\n\n  Let me try R in the first: \n    ""R"" as first: R [not second?] so the second letter must not be R? But we can have any letter in the second? But we know R is not in the second, so that\'s fine.\n\n    Words: \n      - ""RABID"": has B, I, D -> but we don\'t know about these. However, we avoid E, C, N? It has no E, C, N. But note: we have to avoid E? Yes. But it has I and D? We haven\'t tried them.\n\n      - ""RADII"": not common.\n\n      - ""RALLY"": has L, L, Y -> but we have two L\'s? And we don\'t know about L and Y. Also, R is first, then A is third? Actually, ""RALLY"" is R A L L Y -> so the third letter is L, not A? So no.\n\n  We need the third letter to be A.\n\n  So: R _ A _ _\n\n  Examples: \n    - ""RATIO"": but has T, I, O -> but the pattern: R A T I O -> wait, that\'s R in first, A in second? We need A in third. So no.\n\n    - ""REACT"": has E and C? We know E and C are not in the word.\n\n    - ""ROAST"": has O, S, T -> pattern: R O A S T -> that\'s R in first, O in second, A in third, S in fourth, T in fifth. This fits: R _ A _ _ -> with O, S, T. And we avoid C, N, E? Yes.\n\n  But wait, we know E is not in the word? So ""ROAST"" is okay? It doesn\'t have E, C, N.\n\n  However, we have already tried R in the first position? Actually, we haven\'t. We tried R in the second position in the first guess. Now we are trying R in the first.\n\n  But note: the feedback said R is in the word but not in the second position. So it could be in the first? We don\'t know. So we can test.\n\n  Alternatively, we can try a word that has R in the fourth or fifth and also tests other common letters.\n\n  Let me consider ""ROAST"": \n    - It uses R, O, A, S, T. We know A is in the third. We are testing R in the first, O in the second, S in the fourth, T in the fifth.\n\n  But we also want to test more letters? We have already used R, A, and now we are adding O, S, T.\n\n  Another option: ""SHARP"": \n    - S, H, A, R, P -> pattern: S H A R P -> so A in third, R in fourth? This avoids C, N, E.\n\n  We can also consider ""STAIR"": but has I and R? Pattern: S T A I R -> but we know T? We haven\'t tried T. But note: we have to avoid E? Yes. However, we don\'t know about T. But wait, in the first guess we didn\'t have T. So we can use.\n\n  But ""STAIR"" has T in the second? And we are testing R at the end? Also, we are testing S and T and I.\n\n  However, we have a constraint: we know the word has an R. So both ""ROAST"" and ""SHARP"" and ""STAIR"" are valid.\n\n  But we also want to maximize the chance of getting more feedback on other letters.\n\n  Let me compare:\n\n    ""ROAST"": tests R (first), O (second), A (third, known), S (fourth), T (fifth). \n    ""SHARP"": tests S (first), H (second), A (third, known), R (fourth), P (fifth).\n    ""STAIR"": tests S (first), T (second), A (third, known), I (fourth), R (fifth).\n\n  We haven\'t tried any of the letters in these words except R and A. So all are good.\n\n  But note: we know the word has an R, so if we put R in a position we haven\'t tried, we might get a dash or a check.\n\n  How about we choose a word that has R in a position that we haven\'t tried and also includes as many new common letters as possible.\n\n  The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. But we know E and N are out. So we can try T, O, I, S, H, R (already known), D, L, U.\n\n  We want to test as many of these as possible.\n\n  ""ROAST"": has R, O, A, S, T -> 5 distinct: R, O, A, S, T -> and we know A and R are in the word (R is known to be present). So we are testing O, S, T.\n\n  ""SHARP"": has S, H, A, R, P -> testing S, H, P.\n\n  ""STAIR"": has S, T, A, I, R -> testing S, T, I.\n\n  Since T and S are very common, I think ""ROAST"" or ""STAIR"" are good.\n\n  But note: we have to avoid the second position for R? Yes, so we are not putting R in the second.\n\n  Let me choose ""ROAST"" because it tests O and T as well.\n\n  So our next guess: ""ROAST""\n\n  But wait, we have to make sure that the word doesn\'t have any of the absent letters? We know it doesn\'t have C, N, E. ""ROAST"" doesn\'t have these.\n\n  So let\'s go with ""ROAST"".\n\n  However, note that the word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t know. But ""ROAST"" has unique letters.\n\n  Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t have R in the second position and has A in the third, and uses more new letters.\n\n  Another word: ""TRAIN"" -> but has N? We know N is absent. So no.\n\n  ""PLAIT"": has P, L, A, I, T -> pattern: P L A I T -> but we don\'t have R? We know the word has R, so we must include R? Because we are trying to find the word and we know it has R. So we must include R in our guess to get information about its position.\n\n  Therefore, we must include R.\n\n  So I think ""ROAST"" is a good choice.\n\n  Let me check if ""ROAST"" is a valid word? Yes.\n\n  So we\'ll guess ""ROAST"".\n\n  But note: we are not sure if R is in the first position. We are testing.\n\n  If we get:\n    - If R is in the first, we might get a check? Or if it\'s not, we might get a dash? Or if it\'s not in the word at all? But we know R is in the word, so it must be either a dash or a check.\n\n  Similarly for the other letters.\n\n  We are also testing O, S, T.\n\n  So let\'s go with ""ROAST"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- ""A"" is confirmed in the correct position (3rd letter).\n- ""R"" is in the word but not in the 2nd position.\n- ""C"", ""N"", and ""E"" are absent.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include ""R"" (avoiding the 2nd position).\n- Must have ""A"" in the 3rd position.\n- Avoid ""C"", ""N"", ""E"".\n- Test new common letters (e.g., S, T, O) to gather more information.\n\n""roast"" fits these criteria:\n- Places ""A"" in the 3rd position.\n- Places ""R"" in the 1st position (a new position to test).\n- Introduces new letters: O (2nd), S (4th), T (5th).\n- Avoids invalid letters (C, N, E).\n\n<guess>roast</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: roast -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) A(✓) S(-) T(-)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for the second guess ""roast"":
  R: - (in the word but wrong position) -> so R is in the word, but not in the first position (since we guessed it in first and got dash) and we already know it's not in the second (from first guess). So R must be in the fourth or fifth position? Because the third is taken by A.
  O: x (not in the word)
  A: ✓ (correct position, third letter)
  S: - (in the word but wrong position) -> so S is in the word, but not in the fourth position.
  T: - (in the word but wrong position) -> so T is in the word, but not in the fifth position.

 So, to summarize:
  - The word has R, A, S, T. (and we know A is in the third position)
  - The word does not have O, and we already know it doesn't have C, N, E.
  - R is not in position 1, 2, or 3 (because position 3 is A). So R must be in position 4 or 5.
  - S is not in position 4, and T is not in position 5.

 Also, from the first guess, we know R is not in position 2, and now we know it's not in position 1 either.

 The pattern so far: _ _ A _ _

 We know the word contains R, S, T, and A (with A fixed at position 3).

 Since R must be in position 4 or 5, and S and T are also in the word but not in the positions we guessed (S not in 4, T not in 5), we need to assign them to other positions.

 The positions available: 1, 2, 4, 5.

 But note: we have three letters (R, S, T) to place in four positions? Actually, the word has five letters and we have A fixed at 3. So we have positions 1,2,4,5 for the remaining letters. But we have three letters (R, S, T) and one more letter? Because the word must have five distinct letters? Not necessarily, but so far we don't have evidence of duplicates.

 However, we have only identified four letters: R, S, T, A. So there must be a fifth letter.

 Let me denote the word as: [P1] [P2] A [P4] [P5]

 Constraints:
  - R is in {P4, P5}
  - S is in the word but not in P4 -> so S must be in P1 or P2? (since P3 is A and we know S is not in P4, and if it were in P5, that's possible too? But we don't know about P5 yet. Actually, S can be in P1, P2, or P5? But we have to avoid P4. So S is in {P1, P2, P5}.
  - T is in the word but not in P5 -> so T must be in {P1, P2, P4}.

 Also, we have a fifth letter? Actually, we have four known letters: R, S, T, A. But the word has five letters, so there is one more letter. Let's call it X.

 So the word is composed of {A, R, S, T, X} for some letter X.

 Now, we need to assign these to positions 1,2,4,5 (with A fixed at 3) such that:
  - R is in 4 or 5.
  - S is not in 4 -> so S in 1,2, or 5.
  - T is not in 5 -> so T in 1,2, or 4.

 Also, we must avoid O, C, N, E.

 Now, for our next guess, we want to test the positions of R, S, T and also find the fifth letter.

 We know R is in 4 or 5. We can try to test both possibilities? But we have to choose one word.

 We also want to test common letters for the fifth letter.

 Since we have limited guesses, we can try a word that:
  - Has A in the third position.
  - Includes R, S, T (to test their positions) and the fifth letter we choose.
  - Avoids O, C, N, E and any other known absent letters.

 But note: we don't know the fifth letter, so we have to pick one.

 Alternatively, we can try to choose a word that has R in one of the positions (say 4) and then see what happens.

 However, we can also try to cover multiple possibilities.

 Let me think of words that fit the pattern and use common letters.

 We know the fifth letter must be a letter that we haven't tried and is not in the absent list. We have tried: C, R, A, N, E, O, S, T. So we can use: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Common letters: H, I, L, U, D, M, P, Y.

 We can try to use one of these.

 Also, we have constraints on positions.

 Let me try to form a word:

  Option 1: Put R in the fourth position: then the word is _ _ A R _
    Then we have to assign S, T, and X to positions 1,2,5.
    But note: S cannot be in 4 (which is R) and T cannot be in 5? Actually, we don't know if T can be in 5? The constraint is that T is not in the fifth position? Actually, the feedback for T in ""roast"" was that T is in the word but not in the fifth position. So T can be in 1,2, or 4. But if we put R in 4, then T must be in 1 or 2.

    Similarly, S can be in 1,2,5. But if we put R in 4, then S can be in 1,2,5.

    So the word would be: [T or S or X] [T or S or X] A R [S or X]  (but note: T cannot be in 5, so the fifth must be S or X? and T must be in 1 or 2).

    Example: 
      - If we put T in 1, then we have T _ A R _ -> then we need to assign S and X to 2 and 5? But S can be in 2 or 5, and X in the other.
        Words: ""T__AR_"" -> e.g., ""TAROT""? but has O and T repeated? and O is absent. 
        ""TABOR"": has O? absent.
        ""TAMAR"": not a word.

      - If we put T in 2: then _ T A R _ -> 
        Words: ""STAR?"" -> but that's 4 letters? We need 5. ""STARE"" has E? absent. ""STARK"": S T A R K -> that's S in 1, T in 2, A in 3, R in 4, K in 5. 
        This word: ""STARK"" -> has S, T, A, R, K. 
        Check constraints:
          - R is in 4: okay.
          - S is in 1: okay (we don't have a constraint that S cannot be in 1? we only know it's not in 4, which is taken by R).
          - T is in 2: okay (we don't have a constraint that T cannot be in 2? we only know it's not in 5).
          - A in 3: okay.
          - K is the fifth letter.

        And it avoids O, C, N, E.

        So ""STARK"" is a candidate.

  Option 2: Put R in the fifth position: then the word is _ _ A _ R
    Then we have to assign S, T, and X to positions 1,2,4.
    Constraints:
      - S cannot be in 4? Actually, we know S is not in the fourth position? In the feedback for ""roast"", S was in the fourth and we got a dash? Actually, no: in ""roast"", S was in the fourth position and we got a dash meaning it's in the word but not in that position. So S cannot be in 4. Therefore, in this case, if R is in 5, then S must be in 1 or 2.
      - T cannot be in 5? But 5 is R, so T must be in 1,2, or 4? But 4 is available? So T can be in 4? Or in 1 or 2.

    Example: 
      - If we put T in 4: then _ _ A T R -> 
        Then we have to assign S and X to 1 and 2? 
        Words: ""S _ A T R"" -> ""SATYR"": S A T Y R -> but then A is in second? We need A in third. So no.

        ""LAST R"": L A S T R -> but then A is in second? No.

        We need: [1] [2] A [4] [5] = [1] [2] A T R

        So the first two letters are [1] and [2] and then A, then T, then R.

        Words: ""BOATR""? not a word. 
        ""MOATR""? not a word.

        How about ""PARTR""? not a word.

        It's hard to find a common word with this pattern.

      - If we put T in 1: then T _ A _ R -> 
        Then we have to assign S and X to 2 and 4? But S cannot be in 4? So S must be in 2? Then X in 4.
        So: T S A X R -> words: ""TSAR?"" but that's 4 letters. ""TSARS"" has two S's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, we have only one S? Actually, we have S in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice.

        But ""TSARS"" is a word? It's the plural of tsar. But it has two S's? The pattern: T S A R S -> so the fifth letter is S? Then the word has two S's? 

        However, in our feedback for ""roast"", we had only one S and it was marked as present (dash) meaning at least one S. But it could be more? 

        But let's check: the word ""TSARS"" has S in positions 2 and 5? But we have a constraint that S cannot be in the fourth? That's okay because in this word S is in 2 and 5, not 4. 

        But we also have T in 1, which is okay? And A in 3, and R in 4? But wait, we have R in 5? Actually, we are trying R in the fifth? But in ""TSARS"", the fifth is S, not R. So that doesn't work.

        We need R in the fifth. So the word must end with R.

        So T _ A _ R -> and we have to put S in 2? and then the fourth letter is X? So T S A X R.

        What are the possibilities? 
          - X could be a vowel? Like ""TSAR"" is a word, but that's 4 letters. We need 5. 
          - ""TSARS"" is 5 letters but the fifth is S, not R? And the fourth is R? Then it would be T S A R S -> but then R is in the fourth? Then we are not putting R in the fifth? 

        We are considering R in the fifth, so the word must end with R. So the fifth letter is R.

        Therefore, the word is T S A X R -> but we need a letter for X. 

        Common words: I can't think of a common word that is ""TSA?R"". 

      - If we put T in 2: then _ T A _ R -> 
        Then we have to assign S and X to 1 and 4? But S cannot be in 4? So S must be in 1? Then X in 4.
        So: S T A X R -> words: ""STAR?"" 4 letters. ""STARR""? not a word. ""STARE"" has E? absent. ""STARK"" has K? but that would be S T A R K -> then R is in 4? not 5. 

        We need R in 5. So the word must be S T A X R -> and X is the fourth letter.

        Words: ""STAIR"": S T A I R -> that's I in the fourth and R in the fifth? 

        But we have a constraint: T cannot be in the fifth? That's okay because T is in the second. 

        Also, S is in the first? And we know S cannot be in the fourth? That's okay because S is in the first.

        And R is in the fifth? That's what we are testing.

        So ""STAIR"" is a candidate? But wait, we have already used I? We haven't tried I? And I is not in the absent list.

        However, in ""STAIR"", the fourth letter is I, and the fifth is R.

        But note: we have a constraint from the first guess: we know the word has R, and we are putting it in the fifth. 

        Also, we are testing S in the first, T in the second, A in the third, I in the fourth, R in the fifth.

        But we have a problem: in the first guess, we had R in the second position and got a dash. Now we are putting R in the fifth? That's allowed.

        However, we also have to check if the word ""STAIR"" meets the constraints:
          - R is in the word: yes, in fifth.
          - S is in the word: yes, in first -> but we know S is in the word and not in fourth? That's okay because it's in first.
          - T is in the word: yes, in second -> and we know T is in the word and not in fifth? That's okay because it's in second.
          - A in third: correct.
          - I is new.

        And it avoids C, N, E, O.

        So ""STAIR"" is a candidate.

 But note: we have two candidates: 
   Candidate 1: ""STARK"" (with R in fourth and K in fifth)
   Candidate 2: ""STAIR"" (with R in fifth and I in fourth)

 However, we don't know which one is correct. We need to choose one for the next guess.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests both possibilities? But we have to pick one.

 We can also consider that we have only one more letter to find? Actually, we have to find the positions and the fifth letter.

 But note: we have two possibilities for R: either in 4 or 5. And depending on that, the rest changes.

 We can try to choose a word that has R in the fifth and also tests other positions? But we have to include the known letters.

 However, we have limited time. Let's see which candidate is more common? Or we can choose a word that doesn't commit to one of these but tests multiple possibilities.

 But we have to include R, S, T, A and a fifth letter.

 How about we try a word that has R in the fifth and also includes a common fifth letter? Like ""STAIR"" with I.

 Or we can try ""STARK"" with K.

 But note: we have to avoid using letters that are absent? We don't know about I or K.

 Another idea: we can try a word that has the fifth letter in a position that might help us disambiguate? But we don't have much information.

 Alternatively, we can try to use a word that doesn't have R in the fourth or fifth? But we know R must be in fourth or fifth, so we have to put it in one of them.

 Since we have two strong candidates, let's pick one. I'll pick ""STAIR"" because it uses a vowel (I) which might be common.

 But wait, we already have a vowel A. The word might have more vowels? We don't know.

 However, we have tried O and it was absent. So the only vowels we know are A and possibly others? We haven't tried I, U.

 So let's try ""STAIR"".

 But note: in ""STAIR"", we are putting S in the first, T in the second, A in the third, I in the fourth, R in the fifth.

 We know from feedback that S is not in the fourth? That's okay because we are putting it in the first.
 T is not in the fifth? That's okay because we are putting it in the second.

 However, we also have to consider: what if R is actually in the fourth? Then ""STAIR"" would be wrong because it has R in the fifth? But we are testing that.

 If we guess ""STAIR"" and the word is actually ""STARK"", then we will get feedback that I is wrong and R is in the fourth? But we would get:

   S: in the first -> if the word is ""STARK"", then S is in the first? So we would get a check? 
   T: in the second -> in ""STARK"", T is in the second? So check.
   A: in the third -> check.
   I: in the fourth -> but in ""STARK"", the fourth is R, so I is absent? So we get x for I.
   R: in the fifth -> in ""STARK"", the fifth is K, so R is not in the fifth? But we know R is in the word? So we would get a dash for R? 

 Actually, if the word is ""STARK"", then for ""STAIR"":
   S: ✓ (correct position)
   T: ✓ (correct position)
   A: ✓ (correct position)
   I: x (not in the word)
   R: - (in the word but not in the fifth? because in ""STARK"", R is in the fourth)

 So we would get: S(✓) T(✓) A(✓) I(x) R(-)

 That would tell us that the word has R in the fourth? and the fifth letter is not I? Then we can guess ""STARK"" next.

 Similarly, if the word is ""STAIR"", then we get all correct? Or at least we get:
   S: ✓ (if the word has S in first? we don't know yet, but if the word is ""STAIR"", then yes)
   T: ✓ (if the word has T in second? yes)
   A: ✓
   I: ✓ (if the word has I in fourth? yes)
   R: ✓ (if the word has R in fifth? yes)

 So we would get all checks.

 Therefore, by guessing ""STAIR"", we can either solve the puzzle or get very close.

 But note: what if the word is neither? For example, what if R is in the fourth and the word is ""START""? But ""START"" has T repeated? And we have T in the second and fifth? But we know T is not in the fifth? Because in ""roast"", T was in the fifth and we got a dash? So T cannot be in the fifth. So ""START"" is invalid.

 Another possibility: ""STARS""? But then S is in the fifth? And we have S in the first? But we know S is in the word and not in the fourth? That's okay. But then R is in the fourth? So ""STARS"" would be: S T A R S -> 
   Positions: S(1), T(2), A(3), R(4), S(5)

 But we have two S's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed? 

 However, in the feedback for ""roast"", we had S in the fourth and got a dash? But in ""STARS"", there is an S in the fourth? So if we had guessed ""roast"" and the word is ""STARS"", then the feedback for S would have been: 
   In ""roast"", the fourth letter is S, and in ""STARS"", the fourth letter is R? and the first letter is S? So the S in ""roast"" at position 4 is not present? But there is an S in the word? So we would get a dash for S? Which we did.

 But also, in ""STARS"", the fifth letter is S? So when we guessed ""roast"", the fifth letter was T? and we got a dash for T? meaning T is in the word? But in ""STARS"", there is no T? So that would be a problem.

 Wait, let's check: 
   Secret word: STARS
   Guess: ROAST -> 
        R: in STARS? no? because STARS has R in the fourth? and we have R in the first? so R is present? but not in first -> dash? 
        But wait: STARS has one R? in the fourth. So when we guess R in the first, it should get a dash? because R is present but not in first? 
        O: not in STARS -> x
        A: in the third? and STARS has A in third? -> check
        S: in the fourth? but STARS has R in the fourth? so the S in the fourth of the guess is not matching? but there is an S in the first and fifth? so the S in the fourth of the guess should be marked as present? but in the wrong position? -> dash? 
        T: in the fifth? but STARS has S in the fifth? so T is not in the word? -> x

   So feedback for ROAST: R(-), O(x), A(✓), S(-), T(x)

   But in our feedback, we had: R(-), O(x), A(✓), S(-), T(-) -> wait, we had T(-) meaning T is in the word? but in this case, T is not in the word? so it should be T(x). 

   But our feedback was T(-)? Actually, the feedback says: T(-) meaning dash? which is present but wrong position? 

   But in the example above, T is not in the word? so it should be x.

   Therefore, the word cannot be ""STARS"" because we got T(-) meaning T is in the word? but ""STARS"" has no T.

   Similarly, we know T is in the word.

   So the word must have T.

   Therefore, the word has the letters: A, R, S, T, and one more.

   And we have two candidates: ""STARK"" and ""STAIR"".

   There might be others? For example, ""STAPH""? but has P and H? and we don't know. But we are putting R in the fourth? 

   But we have to have R in the word? and we are trying to put it in fourth or fifth.

   Another candidate: ""STARE"" -> but E is absent? so no.

   ""STALE"" -> E absent.

   ""STALK"": L and K? and R? but we don't have R? so no.

   We must have R.

   So the only common words I can think of are ""STARK"" and ""STAIR"".

   Therefore, I'll go with ""STAIR"" for the next guess.

  But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. We know O, C, N, E are absent. ""STAIR"" has none of these.

  So let's guess ""STAIR"".

  If it's not correct, we will get feedback that helps us distinguish.

  Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests the fifth letter without committing to R's position? But that might be hard.

  Given the above, I choose ""STAIR"".

</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: A is correct and in position 3. R is present but not in position 2. C, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (roast)**: A is correct (position 3). R is present but not in position 1. S and T are present but not in positions 4 and 5, respectively. O is absent.

### Key Insights:
- **A** is fixed in **position 3**.
- **R**, **S**, and **T** are in the word, but:
  - R cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 → must be in **4 or 5**.
  - S cannot be in position 4 → must be in **1, 2, or 5**.
  - T cannot be in position 5 → must be in **1, 2, or 4**.
- Absent letters: **C, E, N, O**.
- The word has 5 distinct letters: **A, R, S, T**, and one unknown letter (not C, E, N, O).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test **R in position 5** (since position 4 is still possible for T/S).
- Test **S in position 1** and **T in position 2** (common starting pattern).
- Introduce a new vowel **I** (untested) in position 4 to cover possibilities.
- The word **stair** fits:
  - **S** (position 1), **T** (position 2), **A** (position 3), **I** (position 4), **R** (position 5).
  - Avoids absent letters and tests key constraints.

If correct, this could solve the puzzle. If not, feedback will confirm positions for R/S/T and the validity of I.

<guess>stair</guess>",stair,"We are given feedback for the second guess ""roast"":
  R: - (in the word but wrong position) -> so R is in the word, but not in the first position (since we guessed it in first and got dash) and we already know it's not in the second (from first guess). So R must be in the fourth or fifth position? Because the third is taken by A.
  O: x (not in the word)
  A: ✓ (correct position, third letter)
  S: - (in the word but wrong position) -> so S is in the word, but not in the fourth position.
  T: - (in the word but wrong position) -> so T is in the word, but not in the fifth position.

 So, to summarize:
  - The word has R, A, S, T. (and we know A is in the third position)
  - The word does not have O, and we already know it doesn't have C, N, E.
  - R is not in position 1, 2, or 3 (because position 3 is A). So R must be in position 4 or 5.
  - S is not in position 4, and T is not in position 5.

 Also, from the first guess, we know R is not in position 2, and now we know it's not in position 1 either.

 The pattern so far: _ _ A _ _

 We know the word contains R, S, T, and A (with A fixed at position 3).

 Since R must be in position 4 or 5, and S and T are also in the word but not in the positions we guessed (S not in 4, T not in 5), we need to assign them to other positions.

 The positions available: 1, 2, 4, 5.

 But note: we have three letters (R, S, T) to place in four positions? Actually, the word has five letters and we have A fixed at 3. So we have positions 1,2,4,5 for the remaining letters. But we have three letters (R, S, T) and one more letter? Because the word must have five distinct letters? Not necessarily, but so far we don't have evidence of duplicates.

 However, we have only identified four letters: R, S, T, A. So there must be a fifth letter.

 Let me denote the word as: [P1] [P2] A [P4] [P5]

 Constraints:
  - R is in {P4, P5}
  - S is in the word but not in P4 -> so S must be in P1 or P2? (since P3 is A and we know S is not in P4, and if it were in P5, that's possible too? But we don't know about P5 yet. Actually, S can be in P1, P2, or P5? But we have to avoid P4. So S is in {P1, P2, P5}.
  - T is in the word but not in P5 -> so T must be in {P1, P2, P4}.

 Also, we have a fifth letter? Actually, we have four known letters: R, S, T, A. But the word has five letters, so there is one more letter. Let's call it X.

 So the word is composed of {A, R, S, T, X} for some letter X.

 Now, we need to assign these to positions 1,2,4,5 (with A fixed at 3) such that:
  - R is in 4 or 5.
  - S is not in 4 -> so S in 1,2, or 5.
  - T is not in 5 -> so T in 1,2, or 4.

 Also, we must avoid O, C, N, E.

 Now, for our next guess, we want to test the positions of R, S, T and also find the fifth letter.

 We know R is in 4 or 5. We can try to test both possibilities? But we have to choose one word.

 We also want to test common letters for the fifth letter.

 Since we have limited guesses, we can try a word that:
  - Has A in the third position.
  - Includes R, S, T (to test their positions) and the fifth letter we choose.
  - Avoids O, C, N, E and any other known absent letters.

 But note: we don't know the fifth letter, so we have to pick one.

 Alternatively, we can try to choose a word that has R in one of the positions (say 4) and then see what happens.

 However, we can also try to cover multiple possibilities.

 Let me think of words that fit the pattern and use common letters.

 We know the fifth letter must be a letter that we haven't tried and is not in the absent list. We have tried: C, R, A, N, E, O, S, T. So we can use: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Common letters: H, I, L, U, D, M, P, Y.

 We can try to use one of these.

 Also, we have constraints on positions.

 Let me try to form a word:

  Option 1: Put R in the fourth position: then the word is _ _ A R _
    Then we have to assign S, T, and X to positions 1,2,5.
    But note: S cannot be in 4 (which is R) and T cannot be in 5? Actually, we don't know if T can be in 5? The constraint is that T is not in the fifth position? Actually, the feedback for T in ""roast"" was that T is in the word but not in the fifth position. So T can be in 1,2, or 4. But if we put R in 4, then T must be in 1 or 2.

    Similarly, S can be in 1,2,5. But if we put R in 4, then S can be in 1,2,5.

    So the word would be: [T or S or X] [T or S or X] A R [S or X]  (but note: T cannot be in 5, so the fifth must be S or X? and T must be in 1 or 2).

    Example: 
      - If we put T in 1, then we have T _ A R _ -> then we need to assign S and X to 2 and 5? But S can be in 2 or 5, and X in the other.
        Words: ""T__AR_"" -> e.g., ""TAROT""? but has O and T repeated? and O is absent. 
        ""TABOR"": has O? absent.
        ""TAMAR"": not a word.

      - If we put T in 2: then _ T A R _ -> 
        Words: ""STAR?"" -> but that's 4 letters? We need 5. ""STARE"" has E? absent. ""STARK"": S T A R K -> that's S in 1, T in 2, A in 3, R in 4, K in 5. 
        This word: ""STARK"" -> has S, T, A, R, K. 
        Check constraints:
          - R is in 4: okay.
          - S is in 1: okay (we don't have a constraint that S cannot be in 1? we only know it's not in 4, which is taken by R).
          - T is in 2: okay (we don't have a constraint that T cannot be in 2? we only know it's not in 5).
          - A in 3: okay.
          - K is the fifth letter.

        And it avoids O, C, N, E.

        So ""STARK"" is a candidate.

  Option 2: Put R in the fifth position: then the word is _ _ A _ R
    Then we have to assign S, T, and X to positions 1,2,4.
    Constraints:
      - S cannot be in 4? Actually, we know S is not in the fourth position? In the feedback for ""roast"", S was in the fourth and we got a dash? Actually, no: in ""roast"", S was in the fourth position and we got a dash meaning it's in the word but not in that position. So S cannot be in 4. Therefore, in this case, if R is in 5, then S must be in 1 or 2.
      - T cannot be in 5? But 5 is R, so T must be in 1,2, or 4? But 4 is available? So T can be in 4? Or in 1 or 2.

    Example: 
      - If we put T in 4: then _ _ A T R -> 
        Then we have to assign S and X to 1 and 2? 
        Words: ""S _ A T R"" -> ""SATYR"": S A T Y R -> but then A is in second? We need A in third. So no.

        ""LAST R"": L A S T R -> but then A is in second? No.

        We need: [1] [2] A [4] [5] = [1] [2] A T R

        So the first two letters are [1] and [2] and then A, then T, then R.

        Words: ""BOATR""? not a word. 
        ""MOATR""? not a word.

        How about ""PARTR""? not a word.

        It's hard to find a common word with this pattern.

      - If we put T in 1: then T _ A _ R -> 
        Then we have to assign S and X to 2 and 4? But S cannot be in 4? So S must be in 2? Then X in 4.
        So: T S A X R -> words: ""TSAR?"" but that's 4 letters. ""TSARS"" has two S's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, we have only one S? Actually, we have S in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice.

        But ""TSARS"" is a word? It's the plural of tsar. But it has two S's? The pattern: T S A R S -> so the fifth letter is S? Then the word has two S's? 

        However, in our feedback for ""roast"", we had only one S and it was marked as present (dash) meaning at least one S. But it could be more? 

        But let's check: the word ""TSARS"" has S in positions 2 and 5? But we have a constraint that S cannot be in the fourth? That's okay because in this word S is in 2 and 5, not 4. 

        But we also have T in 1, which is okay? And A in 3, and R in 4? But wait, we have R in 5? Actually, we are trying R in the fifth? But in ""TSARS"", the fifth is S, not R. So that doesn't work.

        We need R in the fifth. So the word must end with R.

        So T _ A _ R -> and we have to put S in 2? and then the fourth letter is X? So T S A X R.

        What are the possibilities? 
          - X could be a vowel? Like ""TSAR"" is a word, but that's 4 letters. We need 5. 
          - ""TSARS"" is 5 letters but the fifth is S, not R? And the fourth is R? Then it would be T S A R S -> but then R is in the fourth? Then we are not putting R in the fifth? 

        We are considering R in the fifth, so the word must end with R. So the fifth letter is R.

        Therefore, the word is T S A X R -> but we need a letter for X. 

        Common words: I can't think of a common word that is ""TSA?R"". 

      - If we put T in 2: then _ T A _ R -> 
        Then we have to assign S and X to 1 and 4? But S cannot be in 4? So S must be in 1? Then X in 4.
        So: S T A X R -> words: ""STAR?"" 4 letters. ""STARR""? not a word. ""STARE"" has E? absent. ""STARK"" has K? but that would be S T A R K -> then R is in 4? not 5. 

        We need R in 5. So the word must be S T A X R -> and X is the fourth letter.

        Words: ""STAIR"": S T A I R -> that's I in the fourth and R in the fifth? 

        But we have a constraint: T cannot be in the fifth? That's okay because T is in the second. 

        Also, S is in the first? And we know S cannot be in the fourth? That's okay because S is in the first.

        And R is in the fifth? That's what we are testing.

        So ""STAIR"" is a candidate? But wait, we have already used I? We haven't tried I? And I is not in the absent list.

        However, in ""STAIR"", the fourth letter is I, and the fifth is R.

        But note: we have a constraint from the first guess: we know the word has R, and we are putting it in the fifth. 

        Also, we are testing S in the first, T in the second, A in the third, I in the fourth, R in the fifth.

        But we have a problem: in the first guess, we had R in the second position and got a dash. Now we are putting R in the fifth? That's allowed.

        However, we also have to check if the word ""STAIR"" meets the constraints:
          - R is in the word: yes, in fifth.
          - S is in the word: yes, in first -> but we know S is in the word and not in fourth? That's okay because it's in first.
          - T is in the word: yes, in second -> and we know T is in the word and not in fifth? That's okay because it's in second.
          - A in third: correct.
          - I is new.

        And it avoids C, N, E, O.

        So ""STAIR"" is a candidate.

 But note: we have two candidates: 
   Candidate 1: ""STARK"" (with R in fourth and K in fifth)
   Candidate 2: ""STAIR"" (with R in fifth and I in fourth)

 However, we don't know which one is correct. We need to choose one for the next guess.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests both possibilities? But we have to pick one.

 We can also consider that we have only one more letter to find? Actually, we have to find the positions and the fifth letter.

 But note: we have two possibilities for R: either in 4 or 5. And depending on that, the rest changes.

 We can try to choose a word that has R in the fifth and also tests other positions? But we have to include the known letters.

 However, we have limited time. Let's see which candidate is more common? Or we can choose a word that doesn't commit to one of these but tests multiple possibilities.

 But we have to include R, S, T, A and a fifth letter.

 How about we try a word that has R in the fifth and also includes a common fifth letter? Like ""STAIR"" with I.

 Or we can try ""STARK"" with K.

 But note: we have to avoid using letters that are absent? We don't know about I or K.

 Another idea: we can try a word that has the fifth letter in a position that might help us disambiguate? But we don't have much information.

 Alternatively, we can try to use a word that doesn't have R in the fourth or fifth? But we know R must be in fourth or fifth, so we have to put it in one of them.

 Since we have two strong candidates, let's pick one. I'll pick ""STAIR"" because it uses a vowel (I) which might be common.

 But wait, we already have a vowel A. The word might have more vowels? We don't know.

 However, we have tried O and it was absent. So the only vowels we know are A and possibly others? We haven't tried I, U.

 So let's try ""STAIR"".

 But note: in ""STAIR"", we are putting S in the first, T in the second, A in the third, I in the fourth, R in the fifth.

 We know from feedback that S is not in the fourth? That's okay because we are putting it in the first.
 T is not in the fifth? That's okay because we are putting it in the second.

 However, we also have to consider: what if R is actually in the fourth? Then ""STAIR"" would be wrong because it has R in the fifth? But we are testing that.

 If we guess ""STAIR"" and the word is actually ""STARK"", then we will get feedback that I is wrong and R is in the fourth? But we would get:

   S: in the first -> if the word is ""STARK"", then S is in the first? So we would get a check? 
   T: in the second -> in ""STARK"", T is in the second? So check.
   A: in the third -> check.
   I: in the fourth -> but in ""STARK"", the fourth is R, so I is absent? So we get x for I.
   R: in the fifth -> in ""STARK"", the fifth is K, so R is not in the fifth? But we know R is in the word? So we would get a dash for R? 

 Actually, if the word is ""STARK"", then for ""STAIR"":
   S: ✓ (correct position)
   T: ✓ (correct position)
   A: ✓ (correct position)
   I: x (not in the word)
   R: - (in the word but not in the fifth? because in ""STARK"", R is in the fourth)

 So we would get: S(✓) T(✓) A(✓) I(x) R(-)

 That would tell us that the word has R in the fourth? and the fifth letter is not I? Then we can guess ""STARK"" next.

 Similarly, if the word is ""STAIR"", then we get all correct? Or at least we get:
   S: ✓ (if the word has S in first? we don't know yet, but if the word is ""STAIR"", then yes)
   T: ✓ (if the word has T in second? yes)
   A: ✓
   I: ✓ (if the word has I in fourth? yes)
   R: ✓ (if the word has R in fifth? yes)

 So we would get all checks.

 Therefore, by guessing ""STAIR"", we can either solve the puzzle or get very close.

 But note: what if the word is neither? For example, what if R is in the fourth and the word is ""START""? But ""START"" has T repeated? And we have T in the second and fifth? But we know T is not in the fifth? Because in ""roast"", T was in the fifth and we got a dash? So T cannot be in the fifth. So ""START"" is invalid.

 Another possibility: ""STARS""? But then S is in the fifth? And we have S in the first? But we know S is in the word and not in the fourth? That's okay. But then R is in the fourth? So ""STARS"" would be: S T A R S -> 
   Positions: S(1), T(2), A(3), R(4), S(5)

 But we have two S's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed? 

 However, in the feedback for ""roast"", we had S in the fourth and got a dash? But in ""STARS"", there is an S in the fourth? So if we had guessed ""roast"" and the word is ""STARS"", then the feedback for S would have been: 
   In ""roast"", the fourth letter is S, and in ""STARS"", the fourth letter is R? and the first letter is S? So the S in ""roast"" at position 4 is not present? But there is an S in the word? So we would get a dash for S? Which we did.

 But also, in ""STARS"", the fifth letter is S? So when we guessed ""roast"", the fifth letter was T? and we got a dash for T? meaning T is in the word? But in ""STARS"", there is no T? So that would be a problem.

 Wait, let's check: 
   Secret word: STARS
   Guess: ROAST -> 
        R: in STARS? no? because STARS has R in the fourth? and we have R in the first? so R is present? but not in first -> dash? 
        But wait: STARS has one R? in the fourth. So when we guess R in the first, it should get a dash? because R is present but not in first? 
        O: not in STARS -> x
        A: in the third? and STARS has A in third? -> check
        S: in the fourth? but STARS has R in the fourth? so the S in the fourth of the guess is not matching? but there is an S in the first and fifth? so the S in the fourth of the guess should be marked as present? but in the wrong position? -> dash? 
        T: in the fifth? but STARS has S in the fifth? so T is not in the word? -> x

   So feedback for ROAST: R(-), O(x), A(✓), S(-), T(x)

   But in our feedback, we had: R(-), O(x), A(✓), S(-), T(-) -> wait, we had T(-) meaning T is in the word? but in this case, T is not in the word? so it should be T(x). 

   But our feedback was T(-)? Actually, the feedback says: T(-) meaning dash? which is present but wrong position? 

   But in the example above, T is not in the word? so it should be x.

   Therefore, the word cannot be ""STARS"" because we got T(-) meaning T is in the word? but ""STARS"" has no T.

   Similarly, we know T is in the word.

   So the word must have T.

   Therefore, the word has the letters: A, R, S, T, and one more.

   And we have two candidates: ""STARK"" and ""STAIR"".

   There might be others? For example, ""STAPH""? but has P and H? and we don't know. But we are putting R in the fourth? 

   But we have to have R in the word? and we are trying to put it in fourth or fifth.

   Another candidate: ""STARE"" -> but E is absent? so no.

   ""STALE"" -> E absent.

   ""STALK"": L and K? and R? but we don't have R? so no.

   We must have R.

   So the only common words I can think of are ""STARK"" and ""STAIR"".

   Therefore, I'll go with ""STAIR"" for the next guess.

  But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. We know O, C, N, E are absent. ""STAIR"" has none of these.

  So let's guess ""STAIR"".

  If it's not correct, we will get feedback that helps us distinguish.

  Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests the fifth letter without committing to R's position? But that might be hard.

  Given the above, I choose ""STAIR"".

<guess>stair</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: A is correct and in position 3. R is present but not in position 2. C, N, E are absent.
