We are making the first guess. There's no prior information, so we want a word that can provide maximum information.
 Commonly, a good starting word uses common letters and has diverse letters to maximize the chance of getting feedback about multiple letters.

I recall that words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ROAST"", etc., are often recommended because they contain common letters and have no repeating letters.

Let me choose ""CRANE"":
- C, R, A, N, E are all fairly common letters.
- It covers vowels (A and E) and common consonants.

After we get feedback on ""CRANE"", we can use that feedback to narrow down possibilities.

So, my first guess is: CRANE

When making the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word with common letters and no repeating characters to maximize information gain. The goal is to cover multiple frequent letters across different positions. A good starting word should include multiple vowels and common consonants.

For this first guess, I'll use a proven opener like **CRANE**. It contains:
- Two vowels (A and E)
- Three common consonants (C, R, N)
- All letters are unique, allowing broad feedback coverage.

This choice tests letters likely to appear in many words, which will optimize the feedback pattern for narrowing down possibilities in subsequent guesses.

We are starting over with a new game. The first guess was ""CRANE"" and the feedback was all 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, we must avoid using any of these letters in our next guess.

 Since none of the letters in ""CRANE"" are present, we need to choose a word that uses entirely different letters.

 We should pick another word that uses common letters but excludes C, R, A, N, E.

 Let's think of common letters that are not in {C, R, A, N, E}. The English alphabet has 26 letters, so we have 21 left.

 Common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, Y, and sometimes K, J, Q, X, Z (but the latter are less common).
 Vowels: O, I, U (since A and E are out).

 We want a word that uses as many common letters as possible and has no repeated letters.

 Some good candidates: 
   - ""SLOTH"": uses S, L, O, T, H (all common, and O is a vowel)
   - ""PIOUS"": uses P, I, O, U, S (but U and I are vowels, and S is common)
   - ""BUMPY"": uses B, U, M, P, Y (U is vowel, Y can be vowel, but we have M and P which are common)

 However, we must ensure we don't use any of the forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, E).

 Let's check:
   ""SLOTH"": S, L, O, T, H -> none of these are in {C,R,A,N,E} -> valid.
   ""PIOUS"": P, I, O, U, S -> valid.
   ""BUMPY"": B, U, M, P, Y -> valid.

 Another classic second guess after eliminating some common letters is ""SLIMY"" or ""PUDGY"", but let's see.

 We want to cover more common letters. The most common remaining letters might include S, T, L, O, etc.

 I think ""SLOTH"" is a good choice because it has S, L, O, T, H. These are all common.

 Alternatively, ""TOILS"" or ""STOMP"" but we must avoid the forbidden letters.

 Let me list the available letters: 
   Available: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We can also consider ""SHIFT"" or ""LIGHT"", but let's pick one.

 I'll go with ""SLOTH"" for the next guess.

 So, the second guess is ""SLOTH"".

 We'll get feedback on this and then adjust accordingly.

 Format: <guess>SLOTH</guess>

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"" (all letters marked as absent: C, R, A, N, E), the secret word contains **none of these letters**. For the next guess, I need a 5-letter word that avoids C, R, A, N, E entirely and uses new common letters to maximize information. 

I chose **""SLOTH""** because:
- It uses high-frequency letters (S, L, O, T, H) not yet tested.
- All letters are unique, covering new consonants and a vowel (O).
- It tests common positions (e.g., S and T often appear at start/end).

This should efficiently narrow down possibilities by checking a fresh set of letters.

Common letters from the remaining set: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y. Less common: J, Q, X, Z.

We should try to include vowels, as every word has at least one vowel. The remaining vowels are I, U, and sometimes Y (which can be a vowel). So we should include at least one of I, U, or Y.

Possible words:
- ""BUMPY"": uses B, U, M, P, Y. This uses common letters and includes a vowel (U) and Y (which can be a vowel). But note that Y is at the end, which is common.
- ""JUMPY"": but J is less common, and we have U and Y. However, J is in the excluded list? No, J is available. But let's see frequency.
- ""FUDGY"": F, U, D, G, Y. D and G are common, and it has U and Y.

But we must check if these words are valid. Assuming they are.

Another option: ""IVORY"" but O is excluded (from SLOTH feedback) and R is excluded (from CRANE). So not possible.

""MIDGY"" - not a common word.

""PICKY"": P, I, C, K, Y. But C is excluded (from CRANE). So invalid.

We must avoid any letter that has been excluded.

Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, L, O, T, H.

So for ""BUMPY"": B, U, M, P, Y. None of these are excluded. So it's valid.

Similarly, ""FUDGY"": F, U, D, G, Y. All are in the available set.

""GUMBY"" - not a word.

""DUMPY"": D, U, M, P, Y. Also valid.

We want to cover as many common letters as possible. The most common remaining letters might be: M, P, B, D, F, G, K, etc.

Another word: ""BUGGY"" but has double G, which might not be ideal because we want unique letters to test more. However, if we can't find a word with unique letters, we might have to repeat. But let's try to avoid repeats.

""BUMPY"" has unique letters: B, U, M, P, Y.

""FUDGY"" has unique letters: F, U, D, G, Y.

""PUDGY"": P, U, D, G, Y. Same as FUDGY but with P instead of F.

We can also consider ""WIMPY"": W, I, M, P, Y. W is available, I is a vowel, M, P, Y. This is also valid.

Which one to choose? We want to test letters that are more likely to appear.

According to English letter frequency, among the remaining letters, the frequencies (from high to low) might be: M, P, B, D, G, F, Y, U, etc. (but standard frequency includes all letters, so we have to adjust for the excluded ones).

Since we have two guesses with no hits, the secret word might have less common letters. But we should still try common ones from the available set.

I think ""BUMPY"" is a good choice because it includes B, U, M, P, Y. M and P are very common, and U is a vowel.

Alternatively, ""WIMPY"" includes W, which is less common, so maybe not.

""DUMPY"" is similar to BUMPY but with D instead of B. D is also common.

But let's pick ""BUMPY"".

We can also consider ""JUMPY"", but J is less common, so if we can avoid it, better.

Another word: ""BIGGY"" - not a word.

""FIFTY"": F, I, F, T, Y. But T is excluded (from SLOTH), and also double F. So invalid.

""MUMMY"" - double M and Y, but M is repeated, and we don't test as many letters.

So I think ""BUMPY"" is a solid choice.

Therefore, the third guess is ""BUMPY"".

We'll see the feedback and then adjust.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. There's no prior information, so we want a word that can provide maximum information.
 Commonly, a good starting word uses common letters and has diverse letters to maximize the chance of getting feedback about multiple letters.

I recall that words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ROAST"", etc., are often recommended because they contain common letters and have no repeating letters.

Let me choose ""CRANE"":
- C, R, A, N, E are all fairly common letters.
- It covers vowels (A and E) and common consonants.

After we get feedback on ""CRANE"", we can use that feedback to narrow down possibilities.

So, my first guess is: CRANE

Returning in the required format.When making the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word with common letters and no repeating characters to maximize information gain. The goal is to cover multiple frequent letters across different positions. A good starting word should include multiple vowels and common consonants.

For this first guess, I'll use a proven opener like **CRANE**. It contains:
- Two vowels (A and E)
- Three common consonants (C, R, N)
- All letters are unique, allowing broad feedback coverage.

This choice tests letters likely to appear in many words, which will optimize the feedback pattern for narrowing down possibilities in subsequent guesses.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are starting over with a new game. The first guess was ""CRANE"" and the feedback was all 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, we must avoid using any of these letters in our next guess.

 Since none of the letters in ""CRANE"" are present, we need to choose a word that uses entirely different letters.

 We should pick another word that uses common letters but excludes C, R, A, N, E.

 Let's think of common letters that are not in {C, R, A, N, E}. The English alphabet has 26 letters, so we have 21 left.

 Common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, Y, and sometimes K, J, Q, X, Z (but the latter are less common).
 Vowels: O, I, U (since A and E are out).

 We want a word that uses as many common letters as possible and has no repeated letters.

 Some good candidates: 
   - ""SLOTH"": uses S, L, O, T, H (all common, and O is a vowel)
   - ""PIOUS"": uses P, I, O, U, S (but U and I are vowels, and S is common)
   - ""BUMPY"": uses B, U, M, P, Y (U is vowel, Y can be vowel, but we have M and P which are common)

 However, we must ensure we don't use any of the forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, E).

 Let's check:
   ""SLOTH"": S, L, O, T, H -> none of these are in {C,R,A,N,E} -> valid.
   ""PIOUS"": P, I, O, U, S -> valid.
   ""BUMPY"": B, U, M, P, Y -> valid.

 Another classic second guess after eliminating some common letters is ""SLIMY"" or ""PUDGY"", but let's see.

 We want to cover more common letters. The most common remaining letters might include S, T, L, O, etc.

 I think ""SLOTH"" is a good choice because it has S, L, O, T, H. These are all common.

 Alternatively, ""TOILS"" or ""STOMP"" but we must avoid the forbidden letters.

 Let me list the available letters: 
   Available: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We can also consider ""SHIFT"" or ""LIGHT"", but let's pick one.

 I'll go with ""SLOTH"" for the next guess.

 So, the second guess is ""SLOTH"".

 We'll get feedback on this and then adjust accordingly.

 Format: <guess>SLOTH</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"" (all letters marked as absent: C, R, A, N, E), the secret word contains **none of these letters**. For the next guess, I need a 5-letter word that avoids C, R, A, N, E entirely and uses new common letters to maximize information. 

I chose **""SLOTH""** because:
- It uses high-frequency letters (S, L, O, T, H) not yet tested.
- All letters are unique, covering new consonants and a vowel (O).
- It tests common positions (e.g., S and T often appear at start/end).

This should efficiently narrow down possibilities by checking a fresh set of letters.

So we should include at least one of I, U, or Y.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""BUMPY"": uses B, U, M, P, Y. This uses common letters and includes a vowel (U) and Y (which can be a vowel). But note that Y is at the end, which is common.\n- ""JUMPY"": but J is less common, and we have U and Y. However, J is in the excluded list? No, J is available. But let\'s see frequency.\n- ""FUDGY"": F, U, D, G, Y. D and G are common, and it has U and Y.\n\nBut we must check if these words are valid. Assuming they are.\n\nAnother option: ""IVORY"" but O is excluded (from SLOTH feedback) and R is excluded (from CRANE). So not possible.\n\n""MIDGY"" - not a common word.\n\n""PICKY"": P, I, C, K, Y. But C is excluded (from CRANE). So invalid.\n\nWe must avoid any letter that has been excluded.\n\nExcluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, L, O, T, H.\n\nSo for ""BUMPY"": B, U, M, P, Y. None of these are excluded. So it\'s valid.\n\nSimilarly, ""FUDGY"": F, U, D, G, Y. All are in the available set.\n\n""GUMBY"" - not a word.\n\n""DUMPY"": D, U, M, P, Y. Also valid.\n\nWe want to cover as many common letters as possible. The most common remaining letters might be: M, P, B, D, F, G, K, etc.\n\nAnother word: ""BUGGY"" but has double G, which might not be ideal because we want unique letters to test more. However, if we can\'t find a word with unique letters, we might have to repeat. But let\'s try to avoid repeats.\n\n""BUMPY"" has unique letters: B, U, M, P, Y.\n\n""FUDGY"" has unique letters: F, U, D, G, Y.\n\n""PUDGY"": P, U, D, G, Y. Same as FUDGY but with P instead of F.\n\nWe can also consider ""WIMPY"": W, I, M, P, Y. W is available, I is a vowel, M, P, Y. This is also valid.\n\nWhich one to choose? We want to test letters that are more likely to appear.\n\nAccording to English letter frequency, among the remaining letters, the frequencies (from high to low) might be: M, P, B, D, G, F, Y, U, etc. (but standard frequency includes all letters, so we have to adjust for the excluded ones).\n\nSince we have two guesses with no hits, the secret word might have less common letters. But we should still try common ones from the available set.\n\nI think ""BUMPY"" is a good choice because it includes B, U, M, P, Y. M and P are very common, and U is a vowel.\n\nAlternatively, ""WIMPY"" includes W, which is less common, so maybe not.\n\n""DUMPY"" is similar to BUMPY but with D instead of B. D is also common.\n\nBut let\'s pick ""BUMPY"".\n\nWe can also consider ""JUMPY"", but J is less common, so if we can avoid it, better.\n\nAnother word: ""BIGGY"" - not a word.\n\n""FIFTY"": F, I, F, T, Y. But T is excluded (from SLOTH), and also double F. So invalid.\n\n""MUMMY"" - double M and Y, but M is repeated, and we don\'t test as many letters.\n\nSo I think ""BUMPY"" is a solid choice.\n\nTherefore, the third guess is ""BUMPY"".\n\nWe\'ll see the feedback and then adjust.\n\nFormat: <guess>BUMPY</guess>The first two guesses (""CRANE"" and ""SLOTH"") resulted in all letters being absent (marked ""x""), eliminating 10 letters: **C, R, A, N, E, S, L, O, T, H**. The secret word must now be composed of letters from the remaining pool: **B, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Prioritize **common letters** from the remaining pool (e.g., B, M, P, D, F, G, U, Y) to maximize information.\n- Include at least **one vowel-equivalent** (U, I, or Y) since most English words require vowels.\n- Avoid repeating letters to test more possibilities.\n\n**""BUMPY""** fits well:\n- Uses **B, U, M, P, Y**—all high-frequency available letters.\n- Tests **U** (vowel) and **Y** (vowel-equivalent).\n- Covers diverse positions (e.g., B at start, Y at end).\n\nIf this guess yields more ""x"" feedback, it will further narrow the search by eliminating B, U, M, P, and Y.\n\n<guess>BUMPY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: SLOTH -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) O(x) T(x) H(x)\nGuess 3: BUMPY -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) U(✓) M(x) P(x) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:
1. CRANE: all letters absent (C, R, A, N, E not in the word)
2. SLOTH: all letters absent (S, L, O, T, H not in the word)
3. BUMPY: B(✓) U(✓) M(x) P(x) Y(✓)

This means:
- The secret word contains B, U, and Y.
- It does not contain M or P.
- Also, from previous guesses, we know the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, S, L, O, T, H.

So, the confirmed letters in the word are B, U, Y.

The position feedback for BUMPY:
- B is correct and in the first position (since it's the first letter and marked correct).
- U is correct and in the second position (second letter marked correct).
- Y is correct and in the fifth position (fifth letter marked correct).

So, the secret word has:
- First letter: B
- Second letter: U
- Fifth letter: Y

Therefore, the word is of the form: B U _ _ Y

Now, we need to find the third and fourth letters.

We know the word does not contain: A, C, E, H, L, M, N, O, P, R, S, T (from the absent letters in previous guesses).

The remaining letters available are: D, F, G, I, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z.

But note that the word must be a valid English word.

We have two positions to fill: the third and fourth.

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with ""BU"", ends with ""Y"", and the third and fourth letters are from the available set and not in the excluded list.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern B U _ _ Y.

Common words that come to mind:
- BUSY? But S is excluded (from SLOTH feedback: S absent). So not possible.
- BUY? Only 3 letters.
- BUGGY? But G is available, but we have two G's? Also, the word must be 5 letters. BUGGY has two G's and Y, but it's 5 letters: B-U-G-G-Y. However, we have feedback that Y is at the fifth position, which matches. But we need to check if G is allowed.

But in the feedback for BUMPY, we have M and P absent, but G hasn't been tested yet.

However, in BUGGY, the third letter is G and the fourth is G. But we have two G's? That's acceptable if the word has repeated letters, but we don't know if the secret word allows repeats. Typically, Wordle allows repeated letters, but in this case, we haven't encountered any yet.

But let's check the available letters: G is available.

But we must also consider that in BUGGY, the third and fourth letters are both G. Is that possible? Yes, but we need to see if it fits.

However, we have feedback that in the third position, M was absent, but that doesn't directly say anything about G.

But let's list possible words.

Other words: 
- BUDDY: B-U-D-D-Y. D is available. But we have two D's? 
- BUFFY: B-U-F-F-Y. F is available, two F's.
- BULKY? But L is excluded (from SLOTH).
- BUNNY? N is excluded (from CRANE).
- BURBY? Not a word.

We need to consider the available letters: D, F, G, I, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Possible words with pattern B U _ _ Y:

- BUDDY: uses D, which is available. But it has double D. The word is valid.
- BUFFY: uses F, double F. Valid word (proper noun, but sometimes accepted).
- BUGGY: uses G, double G. Valid.
- BULKY: L excluded, no.
- BUMFY? Not a word.
- BUNGY? Not a common word, and N excluded.
- BUSBY? S excluded.
- BUTTY? T excluded.

What about BUXOM? But O is excluded and it doesn't end with Y.

We need the word to end with Y.

Another one: BUZZY? B-U-Z-Z-Y. Z is available. Double Z.

So possible words: BUDDY, BUFFY, BUGGY, BUZZY.

But we have to check if they are valid 5-letter words.

All are valid: 
- BUDDY: a friend
- BUFFY: a name or meaning plump, but accepted in word games
- BUGGY: a vehicle or bug-infested
- BUZZY: making a buzzing sound

Now, we have feedback that in the third position, M was absent, but that doesn't help directly.

But we can make a guess that tests the possibilities.

However, we have only two guesses left? We are on the fourth guess, and we have 6 tries total.

But we might be able to guess one of these.

But note that in the feedback for BUMPY, we have:
- Position 1: B correct
- Position 2: U correct
- Position 3: M absent (so M not in word, and not in that position)
- Position 4: P absent (not in word and not in that position)
- Position 5: Y correct

So for the secret word, we know:
- It has B in position 1, U in 2, Y in 5.
- It does not have M or P at all.

Now, for the words we have:
- BUDDY: positions: 1:B, 2:U, 3:D, 4:D, 5:Y
- BUFFY: 1:B, 2:U, 3:F, 4:F, 5:Y
- BUGGY: 1:B, 2:U, 3:G, 4:G, 5:Y
- BUZZY: 1:B, 2:U, 3:Z, 4:Z, 5:Y

We need to find a word that can help distinguish between these or confirm one.

But we have only two positions to fill, and we have multiple possibilities with double letters.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses different letters to test for the presence of D, F, G, Z, etc.

But we have limited letters left to test.

We could guess one of these directly, but if we guess wrong, we get information.

Since we have three guesses left (this is the fourth guess, and we have two more after), we can try to guess a word that is not necessarily of the form BU??Y but that includes other letters to test.

But the secret word is fixed: it is BU??Y, so we must fill the two middle letters.

We can guess a word that has B, U, and Y in the correct positions and tests two new letters for the middle.

But we know the positions: we must have B at 1, U at 2, Y at 5, so we can only vary positions 3 and 4.

So, for the next guess, we can try a word like BUDDY, for example, to test if it is BUDDY.

But if it's not, we get feedback on D.

Similarly, we could try BUFFY, etc.

But to maximize information, we might choose a word that uses letters that are in multiple possibilities, but all our possibilities have double letters, so the third and fourth are the same.

Another idea: are there any words with different third and fourth letters?

For example, BUXOM is not possible because of O and no Y.

BUKES? Not a word.

BUDDY, BUFFY, BUGGY, BUZZY are the main ones.

What about BUMPY? But we already guessed it, and it had M and P absent, and we know it's not that.

Another word: BURRY? But R is excluded.

BURY? Only 4 letters.

BUNNY? N excluded.

So it seems the only possibilities are the double-letter words: BUDDY, BUFFY, BUGGY, BUZZY.

We can try to guess one of them.

But we have to choose which one to try.

We can also try a word that doesn't have the Y at the end but tests other letters, but that might not be efficient because we know Y is at the end.

For example, we could guess a word like ""BIDDY"" but that has I and D, but I is available, but the first letter is B, which is correct, but second is I, which might not be U? But we know second is U, so we must have U in second position.

We cannot change the known positions because they are fixed.

So, for the next guess, we should keep B in first, U in second, and Y in fifth, and try new letters for third and fourth.

But we don't know what letters to try.

We can try BUDDY, for instance.

If we guess BUDDY and it's correct, we win.

If not, we get feedback: 
- B correct, U correct, then D? If D is present but in wrong position? But in BUDDY, D is in third and fourth. If the secret word is BUFFY, then D would be absent, so for BUDDY guess, if secret is BUFFY, feedback would be: B✓, U✓, D(x) because D not in word, then D(x) again, Y✓. So we know D is absent.

Similarly, if we guess BUDDY and secret is BUGGY, then D would be absent, so same.

But if we guess BUDDY and secret is BUDDY, then all correct.

But to save guesses, we might try a word that can eliminate multiple at once.

But since all candidates have the same pattern, we can't easily test with one guess.

Another idea: we can guess a word that is not of the form BU??Y but that includes the letters we want to test, but we have to be careful with positions.

For example, we could guess a word like ""DIZZY"" but that doesn't have B or U, and we know B and U are in the word, so it might not be efficient.

But we know the positions of B, U, Y, so we must keep them.

So, the best is to try one of the candidates.

Let's list the candidates and their letters:

- BUDDY: contains D
- BUFFY: contains F
- BUGGY: contains G
- BUZZY: contains Z

We can try to guess a word that includes D, F, G, Z to see which one is present.

But we have only two positions to fill, and we need to keep B, U, Y fixed.

So, for the next guess, we can use a word that has B in first, U in second, Y in fifth, and for third and fourth, we use two different letters that are in the candidate set, but we don't know which ones.

For example, we could use ""BUDGY"" but that's not a word.

Or ""BUFGY"" not a word.

We are constrained by the English language.

We might have to guess one of the candidates.

Since we have three guesses left, we can start with one.

But let's see the frequency: BUDDY is a common word, BUFFY is less common, BUGGY is common, BUZZY is less common.

Perhaps start with BUDDY.

But to be systematic, we can choose a word that tests a letter that is more common.

D is more common than F, G, Z.

In English, D is very common, F is common, G is common, Z is less common.

So BUDDY or BUGGY might be more likely.

BUGGY has G, which is common.

But let's look at the positions.

Another thought: in the feedback, we have no information about the third and fourth positions, so we need to test them.

We can guess ""BUDDY"" as the fourth guess.

If it's correct, great.

If not, we get feedback that D is absent (if the word is not BUDDY), then we know it must be one of the others, and we can try BUFFY or BUGGY next.

Similarly, if we get that D is present but in wrong position, but in BUDDY, D is in third and fourth, so if D is present, it must be in one of those positions, but if the secret word has D in a different position, but we know the secret word is BU??Y, so positions 3 and 4 are the only unknowns, so if D is in the word, it must be in position 3 or 4.

But if we guess BUDDY and the secret word is, say, BUFFY, then D is not in the word, so we get D absent.

Similarly for others.

So, let's go with BUDDY.

But there is a risk: if it's not BUDDY, we use one guess, but we have two left for the remaining three possibilities? No, if we eliminate BUDDY, we have three left: BUFFY, BUGGY, BUZZY.

Then we need to guess among them.

We could guess a word that tests multiple letters.

For example, we can guess ""FUZZY"" but that doesn't have B or U, and we know B and U are in the word, so it would be inefficient.

We can guess ""GUIDE"" but E is excluded, and positions are wrong.

We must keep B, U, Y in place.

So, I think the best is to guess one of the candidates.

Let's choose BUGGY, for example.

But to decide, let's see which one is more common in Wordle answers.

I recall that BUDDY is a Wordle answer, BUGGY is also one, BUFFY might not be, BUZZY might not be.

But we don't have a list, so we assume all are possible.

Another idea: we can guess a word like ""BIDDY"" but that has I, and I is available, but ""BIDDY"" is a word, meaning a hen or a female chick, but it has B, I, D, D, Y. But the second letter is I, not U. But we know the second letter is U, so we cannot change that.

So, for position 2, it must be U, so we cannot use a word with I in position 2.

Similarly, all guesses must have B in 1, U in 2, Y in 5.

So, for the third and fourth positions, we can only use letters from the available set.

We can try ""BUDDY"" to test for D.

Or ""BUGGY"" to test for G.

But let's try ""BUDDY"" first.

I think it's common.

So, I'll go with BUDDY.

But let's confirm the feedback we would get for different secrets.

If secret is BUDDY, guess BUDDY: all correct.

If secret is BUFFY, guess BUDDY: B✓, U✓, D(x) because D not in BUFFY, D(x) again, Y✓. So we know D is absent.

If secret is BUGGY, similarly, D absent.

If secret is BUZZY, D absent.

So in all cases, if we get D absent, we know it's not BUDDY, and we have to try another.

Then for the fifth guess, we can try, say, BUFFY.

If it's BUFFY, we win.

If not, we get F absent, then it must be BUGGY or BUZZY.

Then sixth guess, we try BUGGY, and if not, it must be BUZZY.

But we have only three guesses left, and four possibilities, but we can cover.

Possibilities: 4, we guess one, if wrong, 3 left, then guess another, if wrong, 2 left, and we have one guess, so we might not get it if there are two left.

For example, after guessing BUDDY and it's wrong, we know it's one of BUFFY, BUGGY, BUZZY.

Then we guess BUFFY. If it's wrong, we know it's either BUGGY or BUZZY, but we have only one guess left, and we don't know which one, so we might guess wrong.

So we need a better strategy.

We need to guess a word that can distinguish between the options.

But with the constraint that we must have B in 1, U in 2, Y in 5.

So for positions 3 and 4, we can only put two letters.

We can put two different letters to test, but we need a word that exists.

For example, is there a word ""BUFGY""? No.

""BUDGY""? No.

""BUZGY""? No.

""BIFGY""? Not a word.

The only words are the double-letter ones.

Perhaps ""BUSKY"" but S excluded.

Or ""BUNJY""? Not a word.

I think we are stuck with the four candidates.

But there might be another word: ""BUMPY"" we already guessed.

Or ""BUBBY""? B-U-B-B-Y, but B is repeated, and we have B in first, but third and fourth are B, but B is already in first, so it's possible, but is it a word? BUBBY means breasts, informal, but might not be in word list.

Similarly, ""BUMMY"" not a word, and M excluded.

""BUPPY""? P excluded.

So probably only the four: BUDDY, BUFFY, BUGGY, BUZZY.

To distinguish, we need to test the letters D, F, G, Z.

But with one guess, we can only test two new letters if we use a word with two different letters, but no such word exists for the pattern.

We can make a guess that doesn't have Y at the end, but that would be inefficient because we know Y is at the end.

For example, guess ""FUDGY"" which is a word, F-U-D-G-Y.

But it doesn't have B, and we know B is at first, so position 1 would be F, which is not B, so we get F in position 1 absent or something, but we know B is at 1, so it's not good.

The feedback for ""FUDGY"" would be: F in position 1, but secret has B in 1, so F is not B, so F might be absent or present elsewhere, but it's messy.

We can guess a word that has the letters D, F, G, Z in it, but with B, U, Y not in position, but we know they are in specific positions.

For example, guess ""DIZZY"" : D-I-Z-Z-Y.

Then feedback:
- D: if present, might be in secret, but we don't know position.
- Similarly for Z.

But we know the secret has B, U, Y, so if we guess ""DIZZY"", we might get:
- D could be correct if in position 3 or 4, but position 1 is D, which is not B, so D would be marked as present but wrong position if it is in the word, or absent if not.
- Similarly for others.

But it might not be efficient.

For instance, if secret is BUDDY, then ""DIZZY"" would have:
- D: present, but not in position 1 (since secret has D in 3 and 4), so D might be marked as present ( - ) for position 1, and also the second D in position 3 of guess? ""DIZZY"" is D-I-Z-Z-Y, so positions: 1:D, 2:I, 3:Z, 4:Z, 5:Y.

For secret BUDDY: B U D D Y
Guess: D I Z Z Y

Feedback:
- Position 1: D vs B -> D not B, and D is in secret but in position 3 or 4, so D should be marked as present but wrong position ( - )
- Position 2: I vs U -> I not U, and I not in secret (since secret has only B,U,D,D,Y), so I absent (x)
- Position 3: Z vs D -> Z not D, and Z not in secret, so Z absent (x)
- Position 4: Z vs D -> same, Z absent (x)
- Position 5: Y vs Y -> correct (✓)

So feedback: D(-), I(x), Z(x), Z(x), Y(✓)

This tells us that D is in the word but not in position 1, and Y is correct, but we already know Y is correct.

But it doesn't tell us where D is, and we don't learn about F, G, Z except that Z is not in the word if we get Z(x), but in this case for BUDDY, Z is absent.

Similarly, for other secrets.

But it's not very efficient because we used a guess that doesn't use the known positions.

The best is to guess one of the candidates and hope.

Since BUMPY had M and P absent, and we have B,U,Y fixed, I think BUDDY is a good guess.

Or BUGGY.

Let's choose BUDDY.

But to be safe, let's see if there's a word that can test two letters.

Another idea: guess ""BUDDY"" but that's one.

Perhaps ""GUIDE"" but E excluded.

I think we have to go with BUDDY.

So, fourth guess: BUDDY

If it's correct, we're done.

If not, we know D is not in the word, so it must be BUFFY, BUGGY, or BUZZY.

Then for the fifth guess, we can try BUFFY.

If BUFFY is correct, done.

If not, then it must be BUGGY or BUZZY.

Then for sixth guess, we guess BUGGY, and if not, it's BUZZY, but we have only one guess, so if we guess BUGGY and it's wrong, we lose, but it might be BUZZY.

So to avoid that, after eliminating BUDDY, we can guess a word that tests for F and G, for example.

But with the position constraint.

For example, guess ""FUZZY"" : F U Z Z Y

But positions: 1:F, 2:U, 3:Z, 4:Z, 5:Y

For secret BU??Y, we know position 2 is U, position 5 is Y, so for guess ""FUZZY"":
- Position 1: F vs B -> F not B, and if F is in the word, it might be marked present.
- Position 2: U vs U -> correct (✓)
- Position 3: Z vs ? 
- Position 4: Z vs ?
- Position 5: Y vs Y -> correct (✓)

If secret is BUFFY, then:
- F is in the word, but in position 3 and 4, not 1. So position 1: F should be marked as present but wrong position ( - )
- U correct (✓)
- Position 3: Z vs F -> Z not F, and Z not in secret (secret has F,F), so Z absent (x)
- Position 4: Z vs F -> same, Z absent (x)
- Y correct (✓)

So feedback: F(-), U(✓), Z(x), Z(x), Y(✓)

This tells us F is in the word but not in position 1.

If secret is BUGGY, similarly, F is not in secret, so F would be absent in position 1.

For secret BUGGY:
- Position 1: F vs B -> F not B, and F not in secret, so F absent (x)
- U correct (✓)
- Z vs G -> Z not G, not in secret, Z absent (x)
- Z vs G -> absent (x)
- Y correct (✓)

Feedback: F(x), U(✓), Z(x), Z(x), Y(✓)

If secret is BUZZY:
- Position 1: F vs B -> F not B, not in secret, F absent (x)
- U correct (✓)
- Position 3: Z vs Z -> correct (✓) if secret has Z in position 3
- Position 4: Z vs Z -> correct (✓) if secret has Z in position 4? Secret BUZZY has Z in 3 and 4, so both correct.
- Y correct (✓)

So for BUZZY secret, guess ""FUZZY"": F(x), U(✓), Z(✓), Z(✓), Y(✓)

So we can distinguish:

- If we get F(-), U(✓), Z(x), Z(x), Y(✓), then it must be BUFFY (since F is present but not in position 1, and Z absent)
- If we get F(x), U(✓), Z(x), Z(x), Y(✓), then it must be BUGGY (F absent, Z absent)
- If we get F(x), U(✓), Z(✓), Z(✓), Y(✓), then it must be BUZZY

And if we get all correct, it's FUZZY, but FUZZY is not a candidate, so not.

So by guessing ""FUZZY"", we can distinguish the three possibilities with one guess.

But ""FUZZY"" has F in position 1, which is not B, but we can still use it.

And it uses U and Y in correct positions.

In the guess ""FUZZY"", position 2 is U, which is correct for the secret, and position 5 is Y, correct, so we get U(✓) and Y(✓).

And position 1 is F, which is not B, so it will be marked as absent or present.

But as above, it works.

Moreover, we don't have to have B in position 1 for the guess, because the feedback will tell us.

But we know B is in position 1, but for the guess, we can have a different letter.

So, for the fourth guess, instead of guessing a candidate, we can guess ""FUZZY"" to test for F and Z.

Then based on feedback, we can determine which one it is.

And we have two guesses left, so we can guess the correct word on the fifth guess.

For example:
- If feedback for FUZZY has F present ( - ), then it's BUFFY, so we guess BUFFY next.
- If feedback has F absent and Z absent, then it's BUGGY, so we guess BUGGY.
- If feedback has Z correct, then it's BUZZY, so we guess BUZZY.

Perfect.

And if by chance it's BUDDY, we already eliminated it? No, we haven't guessed BUDDY yet.

In this case, we are guessing FUZZY without having tested BUDDY.

But if the secret is BUDDY, and we guess FUZZY, what happens?

Secret BUDDY: B U D D Y
Guess FUZZY: F U Z Z Y

Feedback:
- F vs B: F not B, and F not in secret, so F absent (x)
- U vs U: correct (✓)
- Z vs D: Z not D, not in secret, Z absent (x)
- Z vs D: absent (x)
- Y vs Y: correct (✓)

So feedback: F(x), U(✓), Z(x), Z(x), Y(✓)

This is the same as for BUGGY.

But for BUGGY, we also get F(x), U(✓), Z(x), Z(x), Y(✓)

So if we get this feedback, it could be BUDDY or BUGGY.

But we don't know which one.

Problem.

For BUDDY secret: F(x), U(✓), Z(x), Z(x), Y(✓)
For BUGGY secret: same feedback.

So we cannot distinguish between BUDDY and BUGGY with this guess.

And we have only two guesses left.

If we get this feedback, we don't know if it's BUDDY or BUGGY.

Then for fifth guess, if we guess BUDDY and it's wrong, we lose if it's BUGGY, or vice versa.

So not good.

Therefore, this approach doesn't work because BUDDY and BUGGY both give the same feedback for FUZZY.

We need to include D or G in the test.

But we can't with this pattern.

Perhaps guess ""GUIDE"" but E excluded.

Or ""DIZZY"" as before.

Let's try ""DIZZY"" for secret BUDDY:
Guess: D I Z Z Y
Secret: B U D D Y
- D vs B: D not B, but D in secret, so D present ( - )
- I vs U: I not U, not in secret, absent (x)
- Z vs D: Z not D, not in secret, absent (x)
- Z vs D: absent (x)
- Y vs Y: correct (✓)

Feedback: D(-), I(x), Z(x), Z(x), Y(✓)

For BUGGY secret: B U G G Y
Guess DIZZY: D I Z Z Y
- D vs B: D not B, D not in secret (secret has G,G, no D), so D absent (x)
- I vs U: I not U, not in secret, absent (x)
- Z vs G: Z not G, not in secret, absent (x)
- Z vs G: absent (x)
- Y vs Y: correct (✓)

Feedback: D(x), I(x), Z(x), Z(x), Y(✓)

For BUFFY: B U F F Y
Guess DIZZY:
- D vs B: D not B, D not in secret, absent (x)
- I vs U: absent (x)
- Z vs F: absent (x)
- Z vs F: absent (x)
- Y correct (✓)

Feedback: D(x), I(x), Z(x), Z(x), Y(✓) same as BUGGY.

For BUZZY: B U Z Z Y
Guess DIZZY: D I Z Z Y
- D vs B: D not B, D not in secret, absent (x)
- I vs U: absent (x)
- Z vs Z: correct (✓)
- Z vs Z: correct (✓)
- Y correct (✓)

Feedback: D(x), I(x), Z(✓), Z(✓), Y(✓)

So with ""DIZZY"" guess:
- If we get D(-), I(x), Z(x), Z(x), Y(✓), then it must be BUDDY (since D is present)
- If we get D(x), I(x), Z(x), Z(x), Y(✓), then it could be BUGGY or BUFFY (both have no D and no Z)
- If we get D(x), I(x), Z(✓), Z(✓), Y(✓), then it's BUZZY

But we still have ambiguity between BUGGY and BUFFY when we get all absent except Y.

So not resolved.

Therefore, the safest is to guess one of the candidates directly.

Let's guess BUDDY for the fourth guess.

If it's correct, great.

If not, we know D is not in the word, so it's one of BUFFY, BUGGY, BUZZY.

Then for the fifth guess, we can guess BUFFY.

If correct, done.

If not, then it's BUGGY or BUZZY.

Then for the sixth guess, we have to guess between BUGGY and BUZZY.

We can guess BUGGY, and if wrong, it's BUZZY, but we lose because no more guesses.

Unless we can distinguish.

But with no more guesses, we risk losing.

To avoid, after eliminating BUDDY, we can guess a word like ""FUZZY"" to distinguish between BUFFY, BUGGY, BUZZY.

As earlier, for ""FUZZY"" guess:
- If secret BUFFY: F(-), U(✓), Z(x), Z(x), Y(✓)
- If secret BUGGY: F(x), U(✓), Z(x), Z(x), Y(✓)
- If secret BUZZY: F(x), U(✓), Z(✓), Z(✓), Y(✓)

And for BUDDY, we already eliminated it.

So if we guess ""FUZZY"" as fifth guess, we can distinguish:

- If F present ( - ), then BUFFY
- If F absent and Z absent, then BUGGY
- If Z correct, then BUZZY

Then for the sixth guess, we can guess the correct one.

For example:
- If F present, then we guess BUFFY
- If F absent and Z absent, then BUGGY
- If Z correct, then BUZZY

But we only have one guess after, so we can do that.

So plan:
- Fourth guess: BUDDY
  - If correct, done.
  - If not, then D is absent, so secret is BUFFY, BUGGY, or BUZZY.
- Fifth guess: FUZZY
  - Based on feedback, determine which one.
- Sixth guess: guess the correct word.

But for the fifth guess, we guess FUZZY, which is not of the form BU??Y, but it has U and Y in correct positions, so it's fine.

And it tests F and Z.

So let's do that.

Fourth guess: BUDDY

But in the response, we need to make the fourth guess.

So I'll go with BUDDY.

<guess>BUDDY</guess>

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRANE → All letters absent (C, R, A, N, E not in the word)**.  
- **Guess 2: SLOTH → All letters absent (S, L, O, T, H not in the word)**.  
- **Guess 3: BUMPY → B(✓) U(✓) M(x) P(x) Y(✓)**.  
  - This reveals:  
    - **B is correct and in position 1**.  
    - **U is correct and in position 2**.  
    - **Y is correct and in position 5**.  
    - M and P are absent (not in the word).  

### Deductions:
- The secret word must start with **B**, have **U** in position 2, and end with **Y** → Pattern: **B U _ _ Y**.  
- Excluded letters (from all feedback): **A, C, E, H, L, M, N, O, P, R, S, T**.  
- Remaining possible letters: **B, D, F, G, I, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z** (but B, U, Y are already confirmed, so focus on filling positions 3 and 4).  
- Possible candidate words (common 5-letter words fitting the pattern and excluding invalid letters):  
  - **BUDDY** (uses D), **BUFFY** (uses F), **BUGGY** (uses G), **BUZZY** (uses Z).  

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Test **BUDDY** to check for the presence of D and the double-letter pattern.  
  - If correct, the game ends.  
  - If incorrect, feedback will confirm if D is absent, narrowing the candidates to **BUFFY, BUGGY, or BUZZY**.  
- This sets up a decisive fifth/sixth guess (e.g., using **FUZZY** to distinguish between the remaining candidates if needed).

<guess>BUDDY</guess>",BUDDY,"We have feedback from three guesses:
1. CRANE: all letters absent (C, R, A, N, E not in the word)
2. SLOTH: all letters absent (S, L, O, T, H not in the word)
3. BUMPY: B(✓) U(✓) M(x) P(x) Y(✓)

This means:
- The secret word contains B, U, and Y.
- It does not contain M or P.
- Also, from previous guesses, we know the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, S, L, O, T, H.

So, the confirmed letters in the word are B, U, Y.

The position feedback for BUMPY:
- B is correct and in the first position (since it's the first letter and marked correct).
- U is correct and in the second position (second letter marked correct).
- Y is correct and in the fifth position (fifth letter marked correct).

So, the secret word has:
- First letter: B
- Second letter: U
- Fifth letter: Y

Therefore, the word is of the form: B U _ _ Y

Now, we need to find the third and fourth letters.

We know the word does not contain: A, C, E, H, L, M, N, O, P, R, S, T (from the absent letters in previous guesses).

The remaining letters available are: D, F, G, I, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z.

But note that the word must be a valid English word.

We have two positions to fill: the third and fourth.

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with ""BU"", ends with ""Y"", and the third and fourth letters are from the available set and not in the excluded list.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern B U _ _ Y.

Common words that come to mind:
- BUSY? But S is excluded (from SLOTH feedback: S absent). So not possible.
- BUY? Only 3 letters.
- BUGGY? But G is available, but we have two G's? Also, the word must be 5 letters. BUGGY has two G's and Y, but it's 5 letters: B-U-G-G-Y. However, we have feedback that Y is at the fifth position, which matches. But we need to check if G is allowed.

But in the feedback for BUMPY, we have M and P absent, but G hasn't been tested yet.

However, in BUGGY, the third letter is G and the fourth is G. But we have two G's? That's acceptable if the word has repeated letters, but we don't know if the secret word allows repeats. Typically, Wordle allows repeated letters, but in this case, we haven't encountered any yet.

But let's check the available letters: G is available.

But we must also consider that in BUGGY, the third and fourth letters are both G. Is that possible? Yes, but we need to see if it fits.

However, we have feedback that in the third position, M was absent, but that doesn't directly say anything about G.

But let's list possible words.

Other words: 
- BUDDY: B-U-D-D-Y. D is available. But we have two D's? 
- BUFFY: B-U-F-F-Y. F is available, two F's.
- BULKY? But L is excluded (from SLOTH).
- BUNNY? N is excluded (from CRANE).
- BURBY? Not a word.

We need to consider the available letters: D, F, G, I, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Possible words with pattern B U _ _ Y:

- BUDDY: uses D, which is available. But it has double D. The word is valid.
- BUFFY: uses F, double F. Valid word (proper noun, but sometimes accepted).
- BUGGY: uses G, double G. Valid.
- BULKY: L excluded, no.
- BUMFY? Not a word.
- BUNGY? Not a common word, and N excluded.
- BUSBY? S excluded.
- BUTTY? T excluded.

What about BUXOM? But O is excluded and it doesn't end with Y.

We need the word to end with Y.

Another one: BUZZY? B-U-Z-Z-Y. Z is available. Double Z.

So possible words: BUDDY, BUFFY, BUGGY, BUZZY.

But we have to check if they are valid 5-letter words.

All are valid: 
- BUDDY: a friend
- BUFFY: a name or meaning plump, but accepted in word games
- BUGGY: a vehicle or bug-infested
- BUZZY: making a buzzing sound

Now, we have feedback that in the third position, M was absent, but that doesn't help directly.

But we can make a guess that tests the possibilities.

However, we have only two guesses left? We are on the fourth guess, and we have 6 tries total.

But we might be able to guess one of these.

But note that in the feedback for BUMPY, we have:
- Position 1: B correct
- Position 2: U correct
- Position 3: M absent (so M not in word, and not in that position)
- Position 4: P absent (not in word and not in that position)
- Position 5: Y correct

So for the secret word, we know:
- It has B in position 1, U in 2, Y in 5.
- It does not have M or P at all.

Now, for the words we have:
- BUDDY: positions: 1:B, 2:U, 3:D, 4:D, 5:Y
- BUFFY: 1:B, 2:U, 3:F, 4:F, 5:Y
- BUGGY: 1:B, 2:U, 3:G, 4:G, 5:Y
- BUZZY: 1:B, 2:U, 3:Z, 4:Z, 5:Y

We need to find a word that can help distinguish between these or confirm one.

But we have only two positions to fill, and we have multiple possibilities with double letters.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses different letters to test for the presence of D, F, G, Z, etc.

But we have limited letters left to test.

We could guess one of these directly, but if we guess wrong, we get information.

Since we have three guesses left (this is the fourth guess, and we have two more after), we can try to guess a word that is not necessarily of the form BU??Y but that includes other letters to test.

But the secret word is fixed: it is BU??Y, so we must fill the two middle letters.

We can guess a word that has B, U, and Y in the correct positions and tests two new letters for the middle.

But we know the positions: we must have B at 1, U at 2, Y at 5, so we can only vary positions 3 and 4.

So, for the next guess, we can try a word like BUDDY, for example, to test if it is BUDDY.

But if it's not, we get feedback on D.

Similarly, we could try BUFFY, etc.

But to maximize information, we might choose a word that uses letters that are in multiple possibilities, but all our possibilities have double letters, so the third and fourth are the same.

Another idea: are there any words with different third and fourth letters?

For example, BUXOM is not possible because of O and no Y.

BUKES? Not a word.

BUDDY, BUFFY, BUGGY, BUZZY are the main ones.

What about BUMPY? But we already guessed it, and it had M and P absent, and we know it's not that.

Another word: BURRY? But R is excluded.

BURY? Only 4 letters.

BUNNY? N excluded.

So it seems the only possibilities are the double-letter words: BUDDY, BUFFY, BUGGY, BUZZY.

We can try to guess one of them.

But we have to choose which one to try.

We can also try a word that doesn't have the Y at the end but tests other letters, but that might not be efficient because we know Y is at the end.

For example, we could guess a word like ""BIDDY"" but that has I and D, but I is available, but the first letter is B, which is correct, but second is I, which might not be U? But we know second is U, so we must have U in second position.

We cannot change the known positions because they are fixed.

So, for the next guess, we should keep B in first, U in second, and Y in fifth, and try new letters for third and fourth.

But we don't know what letters to try.

We can try BUDDY, for instance.

If we guess BUDDY and it's correct, we win.

If not, we get feedback: 
- B correct, U correct, then D? If D is present but in wrong position? But in BUDDY, D is in third and fourth. If the secret word is BUFFY, then D would be absent, so for BUDDY guess, if secret is BUFFY, feedback would be: B✓, U✓, D(x) because D not in word, then D(x) again, Y✓. So we know D is absent.

Similarly, if we guess BUDDY and secret is BUGGY, then D would be absent, so same.

But if we guess BUDDY and secret is BUDDY, then all correct.

But to save guesses, we might try a word that can eliminate multiple at once.

But since all candidates have the same pattern, we can't easily test with one guess.

Another idea: we can guess a word that is not of the form BU??Y but that includes the letters we want to test, but we have to be careful with positions.

For example, we could guess a word like ""DIZZY"" but that doesn't have B or U, and we know B and U are in the word, so it might not be efficient.

But we know the positions of B, U, Y, so we must keep them.

So, the best is to try one of the candidates.

Let's list the candidates and their letters:

- BUDDY: contains D
- BUFFY: contains F
- BUGGY: contains G
- BUZZY: contains Z

We can try to guess a word that includes D, F, G, Z to see which one is present.

But we have only two positions to fill, and we need to keep B, U, Y fixed.

So, for the next guess, we can use a word that has B in first, U in second, Y in fifth, and for third and fourth, we use two different letters that are in the candidate set, but we don't know which ones.

For example, we could use ""BUDGY"" but that's not a word.

Or ""BUFGY"" not a word.

We are constrained by the English language.

We might have to guess one of the candidates.

Since we have three guesses left, we can start with one.

But let's see the frequency: BUDDY is a common word, BUFFY is less common, BUGGY is common, BUZZY is less common.

Perhaps start with BUDDY.

But to be systematic, we can choose a word that tests a letter that is more common.

D is more common than F, G, Z.

In English, D is very common, F is common, G is common, Z is less common.

So BUDDY or BUGGY might be more likely.

BUGGY has G, which is common.

But let's look at the positions.

Another thought: in the feedback, we have no information about the third and fourth positions, so we need to test them.

We can guess ""BUDDY"" as the fourth guess.

If it's correct, great.

If not, we get feedback that D is absent (if the word is not BUDDY), then we know it must be one of the others, and we can try BUFFY or BUGGY next.

Similarly, if we get that D is present but in wrong position, but in BUDDY, D is in third and fourth, so if D is present, it must be in one of those positions, but if the secret word has D in a different position, but we know the secret word is BU??Y, so positions 3 and 4 are the only unknowns, so if D is in the word, it must be in position 3 or 4.

But if we guess BUDDY and the secret word is, say, BUFFY, then D is not in the word, so we get D absent.

Similarly for others.

So, let's go with BUDDY.

But there is a risk: if it's not BUDDY, we use one guess, but we have two left for the remaining three possibilities? No, if we eliminate BUDDY, we have three left: BUFFY, BUGGY, BUZZY.

Then we need to guess among them.

We could guess a word that tests multiple letters.

For example, we can guess ""FUZZY"" but that doesn't have B or U, and we know B and U are in the word, so it would be inefficient.

We can guess ""GUIDE"" but E is excluded, and positions are wrong.

We must keep B, U, Y in place.

So, I think the best is to guess one of the candidates.

Let's choose BUGGY, for example.

But to decide, let's see which one is more common in Wordle answers.

I recall that BUDDY is a Wordle answer, BUGGY is also one, BUFFY might not be, BUZZY might not be.

But we don't have a list, so we assume all are possible.

Another idea: we can guess a word like ""BIDDY"" but that has I, and I is available, but ""BIDDY"" is a word, meaning a hen or a female chick, but it has B, I, D, D, Y. But the second letter is I, not U. But we know the second letter is U, so we cannot change that.

So, for position 2, it must be U, so we cannot use a word with I in position 2.

Similarly, all guesses must have B in 1, U in 2, Y in 5.

So, for the third and fourth positions, we can only use letters from the available set.

We can try ""BUDDY"" to test for D.

Or ""BUGGY"" to test for G.

But let's try ""BUDDY"" first.

I think it's common.

So, I'll go with BUDDY.

But let's confirm the feedback we would get for different secrets.

If secret is BUDDY, guess BUDDY: all correct.

If secret is BUFFY, guess BUDDY: B✓, U✓, D(x) because D not in BUFFY, D(x) again, Y✓. So we know D is absent.

If secret is BUGGY, similarly, D absent.

If secret is BUZZY, D absent.

So in all cases, if we get D absent, we know it's not BUDDY, and we have to try another.

Then for the fifth guess, we can try, say, BUFFY.

If it's BUFFY, we win.

If not, we get F absent, then it must be BUGGY or BUZZY.

Then sixth guess, we try BUGGY, and if not, it must be BUZZY.

But we have only three guesses left, and four possibilities, but we can cover.

Possibilities: 4, we guess one, if wrong, 3 left, then guess another, if wrong, 2 left, and we have one guess, so we might not get it if there are two left.

For example, after guessing BUDDY and it's wrong, we know it's one of BUFFY, BUGGY, BUZZY.

Then we guess BUFFY. If it's wrong, we know it's either BUGGY or BUZZY, but we have only one guess left, and we don't know which one, so we might guess wrong.

So we need a better strategy.

We need to guess a word that can distinguish between the options.

But with the constraint that we must have B in 1, U in 2, Y in 5.

So for positions 3 and 4, we can only put two letters.

We can put two different letters to test, but we need a word that exists.

For example, is there a word ""BUFGY""? No.

""BUDGY""? No.

""BUZGY""? No.

""BIFGY""? Not a word.

The only words are the double-letter ones.

Perhaps ""BUSKY"" but S excluded.

Or ""BUNJY""? Not a word.

I think we are stuck with the four candidates.

But there might be another word: ""BUMPY"" we already guessed.

Or ""BUBBY""? B-U-B-B-Y, but B is repeated, and we have B in first, but third and fourth are B, but B is already in first, so it's possible, but is it a word? BUBBY means breasts, informal, but might not be in word list.

Similarly, ""BUMMY"" not a word, and M excluded.

""BUPPY""? P excluded.

So probably only the four: BUDDY, BUFFY, BUGGY, BUZZY.

To distinguish, we need to test the letters D, F, G, Z.

But with one guess, we can only test two new letters if we use a word with two different letters, but no such word exists for the pattern.

We can make a guess that doesn't have Y at the end, but that would be inefficient because we know Y is at the end.

For example, guess ""FUDGY"" which is a word, F-U-D-G-Y.

But it doesn't have B, and we know B is at first, so position 1 would be F, which is not B, so we get F in position 1 absent or something, but we know B is at 1, so it's not good.

The feedback for ""FUDGY"" would be: F in position 1, but secret has B in 1, so F is not B, so F might be absent or present elsewhere, but it's messy.

We can guess a word that has the letters D, F, G, Z in it, but with B, U, Y not in position, but we know they are in specific positions.

For example, guess ""DIZZY"" : D-I-Z-Z-Y.

Then feedback:
- D: if present, might be in secret, but we don't know position.
- Similarly for Z.

But we know the secret has B, U, Y, so if we guess ""DIZZY"", we might get:
- D could be correct if in position 3 or 4, but position 1 is D, which is not B, so D would be marked as present but wrong position if it is in the word, or absent if not.
- Similarly for others.

But it might not be efficient.

For instance, if secret is BUDDY, then ""DIZZY"" would have:
- D: present, but not in position 1 (since secret has D in 3 and 4), so D might be marked as present ( - ) for position 1, and also the second D in position 3 of guess? ""DIZZY"" is D-I-Z-Z-Y, so positions: 1:D, 2:I, 3:Z, 4:Z, 5:Y.

For secret BUDDY: B U D D Y
Guess: D I Z Z Y

Feedback:
- Position 1: D vs B -> D not B, and D is in secret but in position 3 or 4, so D should be marked as present but wrong position ( - )
- Position 2: I vs U -> I not U, and I not in secret (since secret has only B,U,D,D,Y), so I absent (x)
- Position 3: Z vs D -> Z not D, and Z not in secret, so Z absent (x)
- Position 4: Z vs D -> same, Z absent (x)
- Position 5: Y vs Y -> correct (✓)

So feedback: D(-), I(x), Z(x), Z(x), Y(✓)

This tells us that D is in the word but not in position 1, and Y is correct, but we already know Y is correct.

But it doesn't tell us where D is, and we don't learn about F, G, Z except that Z is not in the word if we get Z(x), but in this case for BUDDY, Z is absent.

Similarly, for other secrets.

But it's not very efficient because we used a guess that doesn't use the known positions.

The best is to guess one of the candidates and hope.

Since BUMPY had M and P absent, and we have B,U,Y fixed, I think BUDDY is a good guess.

Or BUGGY.

Let's choose BUDDY.

But to be safe, let's see if there's a word that can test two letters.

Another idea: guess ""BUDDY"" but that's one.

Perhaps ""GUIDE"" but E excluded.

I think we have to go with BUDDY.

So, fourth guess: BUDDY

If it's correct, we're done.

If not, we know D is not in the word, so it must be BUFFY, BUGGY, or BUZZY.

Then for the fifth guess, we can try BUFFY.

If BUFFY is correct, done.

If not, then it must be BUGGY or BUZZY.

Then for sixth guess, we guess BUGGY, and if not, it's BUZZY, but we have only one guess, so if we guess BUGGY and it's wrong, we lose, but it might be BUZZY.

So to avoid that, after eliminating BUDDY, we can guess a word that tests for F and G, for example.

But with the position constraint.

For example, guess ""FUZZY"" : F U Z Z Y

But positions: 1:F, 2:U, 3:Z, 4:Z, 5:Y

For secret BU??Y, we know position 2 is U, position 5 is Y, so for guess ""FUZZY"":
- Position 1: F vs B -> F not B, and if F is in the word, it might be marked present.
- Position 2: U vs U -> correct (✓)
- Position 3: Z vs ? 
- Position 4: Z vs ?
- Position 5: Y vs Y -> correct (✓)

If secret is BUFFY, then:
- F is in the word, but in position 3 and 4, not 1. So position 1: F should be marked as present but wrong position ( - )
- U correct (✓)
- Position 3: Z vs F -> Z not F, and Z not in secret (secret has F,F), so Z absent (x)
- Position 4: Z vs F -> same, Z absent (x)
- Y correct (✓)

So feedback: F(-), U(✓), Z(x), Z(x), Y(✓)

This tells us F is in the word but not in position 1.

If secret is BUGGY, similarly, F is not in secret, so F would be absent in position 1.

For secret BUGGY:
- Position 1: F vs B -> F not B, and F not in secret, so F absent (x)
- U correct (✓)
- Z vs G -> Z not G, not in secret, Z absent (x)
- Z vs G -> absent (x)
- Y correct (✓)

Feedback: F(x), U(✓), Z(x), Z(x), Y(✓)

If secret is BUZZY:
- Position 1: F vs B -> F not B, not in secret, F absent (x)
- U correct (✓)
- Position 3: Z vs Z -> correct (✓) if secret has Z in position 3
- Position 4: Z vs Z -> correct (✓) if secret has Z in position 4? Secret BUZZY has Z in 3 and 4, so both correct.
- Y correct (✓)

So for BUZZY secret, guess ""FUZZY"": F(x), U(✓), Z(✓), Z(✓), Y(✓)

So we can distinguish:

- If we get F(-), U(✓), Z(x), Z(x), Y(✓), then it must be BUFFY (since F is present but not in position 1, and Z absent)
- If we get F(x), U(✓), Z(x), Z(x), Y(✓), then it must be BUGGY (F absent, Z absent)
- If we get F(x), U(✓), Z(✓), Z(✓), Y(✓), then it must be BUZZY

And if we get all correct, it's FUZZY, but FUZZY is not a candidate, so not.

So by guessing ""FUZZY"", we can distinguish the three possibilities with one guess.

But ""FUZZY"" has F in position 1, which is not B, but we can still use it.

And it uses U and Y in correct positions.

In the guess ""FUZZY"", position 2 is U, which is correct for the secret, and position 5 is Y, correct, so we get U(✓) and Y(✓).

And position 1 is F, which is not B, so it will be marked as absent or present.

But as above, it works.

Moreover, we don't have to have B in position 1 for the guess, because the feedback will tell us.

But we know B is in position 1, but for the guess, we can have a different letter.

So, for the fourth guess, instead of guessing a candidate, we can guess ""FUZZY"" to test for F and Z.

Then based on feedback, we can determine which one it is.

And we have two guesses left, so we can guess the correct word on the fifth guess.

For example:
- If feedback for FUZZY has F present ( - ), then it's BUFFY, so we guess BUFFY next.
- If feedback has F absent and Z absent, then it's BUGGY, so we guess BUGGY.
- If feedback has Z correct, then it's BUZZY, so we guess BUZZY.

Perfect.

And if by chance it's BUDDY, we already eliminated it? No, we haven't guessed BUDDY yet.

In this case, we are guessing FUZZY without having tested BUDDY.

But if the secret is BUDDY, and we guess FUZZY, what happens?

Secret BUDDY: B U D D Y
Guess FUZZY: F U Z Z Y

Feedback:
- F vs B: F not B, and F not in secret, so F absent (x)
- U vs U: correct (✓)
- Z vs D: Z not D, not in secret, Z absent (x)
- Z vs D: absent (x)
- Y vs Y: correct (✓)

So feedback: F(x), U(✓), Z(x), Z(x), Y(✓)

This is the same as for BUGGY.

But for BUGGY, we also get F(x), U(✓), Z(x), Z(x), Y(✓)

So if we get this feedback, it could be BUDDY or BUGGY.

But we don't know which one.

Problem.

For BUDDY secret: F(x), U(✓), Z(x), Z(x), Y(✓)
For BUGGY secret: same feedback.

So we cannot distinguish between BUDDY and BUGGY with this guess.

And we have only two guesses left.

If we get this feedback, we don't know if it's BUDDY or BUGGY.

Then for fifth guess, if we guess BUDDY and it's wrong, we lose if it's BUGGY, or vice versa.

So not good.

Therefore, this approach doesn't work because BUDDY and BUGGY both give the same feedback for FUZZY.

We need to include D or G in the test.

But we can't with this pattern.

Perhaps guess ""GUIDE"" but E excluded.

Or ""DIZZY"" as before.

Let's try ""DIZZY"" for secret BUDDY:
Guess: D I Z Z Y
Secret: B U D D Y
- D vs B: D not B, but D in secret, so D present ( - )
- I vs U: I not U, not in secret, absent (x)
- Z vs D: Z not D, not in secret, absent (x)
- Z vs D: absent (x)
- Y vs Y: correct (✓)

Feedback: D(-), I(x), Z(x), Z(x), Y(✓)

For BUGGY secret: B U G G Y
Guess DIZZY: D I Z Z Y
- D vs B: D not B, D not in secret (secret has G,G, no D), so D absent (x)
- I vs U: I not U, not in secret, absent (x)
- Z vs G: Z not G, not in secret, absent (x)
- Z vs G: absent (x)
- Y vs Y: correct (✓)

Feedback: D(x), I(x), Z(x), Z(x), Y(✓)

For BUFFY: B U F F Y
Guess DIZZY:
- D vs B: D not B, D not in secret, absent (x)
- I vs U: absent (x)
- Z vs F: absent (x)
- Z vs F: absent (x)
- Y correct (✓)

Feedback: D(x), I(x), Z(x), Z(x), Y(✓) same as BUGGY.

For BUZZY: B U Z Z Y
Guess DIZZY: D I Z Z Y
- D vs B: D not B, D not in secret, absent (x)
- I vs U: absent (x)
- Z vs Z: correct (✓)
- Z vs Z: correct (✓)
- Y correct (✓)

Feedback: D(x), I(x), Z(✓), Z(✓), Y(✓)

So with ""DIZZY"" guess:
- If we get D(-), I(x), Z(x), Z(x), Y(✓), then it must be BUDDY (since D is present)
- If we get D(x), I(x), Z(x), Z(x), Y(✓), then it could be BUGGY or BUFFY (both have no D and no Z)
- If we get D(x), I(x), Z(✓), Z(✓), Y(✓), then it's BUZZY

But we still have ambiguity between BUGGY and BUFFY when we get all absent except Y.

So not resolved.

Therefore, the safest is to guess one of the candidates directly.

Let's guess BUDDY for the fourth guess.

If it's correct, great.

If not, we know D is not in the word, so it's one of BUFFY, BUGGY, BUZZY.

Then for the fifth guess, we can guess BUFFY.

If correct, done.

If not, then it's BUGGY or BUZZY.

Then for the sixth guess, we have to guess between BUGGY and BUZZY.

We can guess BUGGY, and if wrong, it's BUZZY, but we lose because no more guesses.

Unless we can distinguish.

But with no more guesses, we risk losing.

To avoid, after eliminating BUDDY, we can guess a word like ""FUZZY"" to distinguish between BUFFY, BUGGY, BUZZY.

As earlier, for ""FUZZY"" guess:
- If secret BUFFY: F(-), U(✓), Z(x), Z(x), Y(✓)
- If secret BUGGY: F(x), U(✓), Z(x), Z(x), Y(✓)
- If secret BUZZY: F(x), U(✓), Z(✓), Z(✓), Y(✓)

And for BUDDY, we already eliminated it.

So if we guess ""FUZZY"" as fifth guess, we can distinguish:

- If F present ( - ), then BUFFY
- If F absent and Z absent, then BUGGY
- If Z correct, then BUZZY

Then for the sixth guess, we can guess the correct one.

For example:
- If F present, then we guess BUFFY
- If F absent and Z absent, then BUGGY
- If Z correct, then BUZZY

But we only have one guess after, so we can do that.

So plan:
- Fourth guess: BUDDY
  - If correct, done.
  - If not, then D is absent, so secret is BUFFY, BUGGY, or BUZZY.
- Fifth guess: FUZZY
  - Based on feedback, determine which one.
- Sixth guess: guess the correct word.

But for the fifth guess, we guess FUZZY, which is not of the form BU??Y, but it has U and Y in correct positions, so it's fine.

And it tests F and Z.

So let's do that.

Fourth guess: BUDDY

But in the response, we need to make the fourth guess.

So I'll go with BUDDY.

<guess>BUDDY</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRANE → All letters absent (C, R, A, N, E not in the word)**.  
- **Guess 2: SLOTH → All letters absent (S, L, O, T, H not in the word)**.  
- **Guess 3: BUMPY → B(✓) U(✓) M(x) P(x) Y(✓)**.  
  - This reveals:  
    - **B is correct and in position 1**.  
    - **U is correct and in position 2**.  
    - **Y is correct and in position 5**.  
    - M and P are absent (not in the word).  

### Deductions:
- The secret word must start with **B**, have **U** in position 2, and end with **Y** → Pattern: **B U _ _ Y**.  
- Excluded letters (from all feedback): **A, C, E, H, L, M, N, O, P, R, S, T**.  
- Remaining possible letters: **B, D, F, G, I, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z** (but B, U, Y are already confirmed, so focus on filling positions 3 and 4).  
- Possible candidate words (common 5-letter words fitting the pattern and excluding invalid letters):  
  - **BUDDY** (uses D), **BUFFY** (uses F), **BUGGY** (uses G), **BUZZY** (uses Z).  

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Test **BUDDY** to check for the presence of D and the double-letter pattern.  
  - If correct, the game ends.  
  - If incorrect, feedback will confirm if D is absent, narrowing the candidates to **BUFFY, BUGGY, or BUZZY**.  
- This sets up a decisive fifth/sixth guess (e.g., using **FUZZY** to distinguish between the remaining candidates if needed).",Guess 4: BUDDY -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) U(✓) D(✓) D(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
