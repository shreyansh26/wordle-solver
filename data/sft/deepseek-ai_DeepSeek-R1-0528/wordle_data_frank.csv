First, the game is Wordle, where I need to guess a 5-letter secret word with up to 6 tries. For my first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information I get. That means picking a word with common letters to cover as many possibilities as possible.

I recall that in Wordle, common starting words include words with frequent vowels and consonants. Letters like E, A, R, S, T are very common in English words. So, I should choose a word that includes several of these.

Some popular starting words are ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", ""TRACE"", etc. These cover multiple vowels and common consonants.

Let me think about the vowels: A, E, I, O, U are vowels, and I should try to include at least one or two. Consonants like R, S, T, N, L are also frequent.

For example, ""ROAST"" has R, O, A, S, T – that's good because it includes two vowels (O and A) and common consonants.

""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E – R, A, E are common.

""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E.

""SALET"" is another one, but it's less common.

I want a word that is all unique letters to cover more ground. Duplicate letters would give less information.

Let me list possible first guesses: I can start with ""CRANE"".

Why ""CRANE""? It has C, R, A, N, E. C is not as common as S or T, but E, A, R are very frequent. R is a common consonant, E is the most common vowel, A is also common.

Alternatives: ""RAISE"" has R,A,I,S,E – lots of vowels and common consonants.

""IRATE"" – I,R,A,T,E.

But perhaps ""CRANE"" is a solid choice.

Since the feedback will tell me which letters are in the word and their positions, I should try to cover different positions.

But for the first guess, position isn't as critical because I don't have any information.

I think ""CRANE"" is a balanced choice.

Another common one is ""ADIEU"" which has many vowels – A,D,I,E,U. That might be good for vowel coverage, but consonants are important too.

""SLATE"" seems better: S,L,A,T,E – S and T are very common consonants.

S, L, A, T, E – L is common but not as frequent as S or T.

Let me check letter frequencies in English.

According to data, the most common letters in 5-letter words are: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, etc.

Specifically for Wordle, from past games, E, S, A, O, R, I, L, T are top letters.

So, a word with S, E, A, R, T might be ideal.

""STARE"" – S,T,A,R,E – that includes S, T, A, R, E – all highly common letters.

Similarly, ""ROAST"" was R,O,A,S,T – O instead of E.

E is more frequent than O, so ""STARE"" might be slightly better.

""CRANE"" has C and N, which are less common.

I should go with ""STARE"".

But ""SLATE"" is S,L,A,T,E – L is slightly less common than R.

""STARE"" has R, which is good.

Another popular one is ""CRATE"" – C,R,A,T,E – C is less common.

""RAISE"" – R,A,I,S,E – I is common.

To maximize, perhaps ""STARE"" or ""SALET"".

I think ""STARE"" is a good choice for first guess.

But let me confirm: S, T, A, R, E – position-wise, S and E are often at ends, but it's fine.

Since I have to output in the format, I'll go with ""STARE"".

The response format requires me to think step by step, then output the guess.

So for my thought process: I should choose a starting word that includes common letters to gather as much feedback as possible. The letters S, T, A, R, and E are among the most frequent in English words, so ""STARE"" is an effective first guess. It will help identify correct letters and positions, or at least presence/absence, which can guide subsequent guesses.

I think that's reasonable.

We have feedback from the first guess ""STARE"":
- S: x (not in the word)
- T: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct letter and correct position, so A is the third letter)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position; since position is wrong and it was fourth, R is in the word but not at position 4)
- E: x (not in the word)

From this, we know:
- The secret word contains an 'A' as the third letter.
- It also contains an 'R', but not as the fourth letter (since position is wrong).
- Letters S, T, E are not in the word at all.

We need to make a second guess that is a 5-letter word with:
- 'A' in the third position (because A is confirmed there).
- Must include 'R' somewhere, but not in the fourth position.
- Should not include S, T, E.
- We can include other common letters to test more possibilities.

Given that S, T, E are out, we have to choose from other letters.

We also need to consider that R is in the word but not in position 4. Possible positions for R: since the word has positions 1,2,3,4,5 and we know position 3 is A, so R cannot be at 3. Possible positions: 1,2,4,5? But position 4 is excluded from the feedback? Wait no: the feedback for R is ""-"", meaning present but not at position 4. So R could be at position 1,2, or 5? But we don't know yet.

Positions: 
1: unknown
2: unknown
3: A
4: unknown, but cannot be R? Actually, from feedback, R is not at 4, but it could be at 1,2, or 5.
Position 5 is possible.

Also, S, T, E are absent, so we avoid those.

What common letters can we use? We might want to test other vowels and consonants.

Other vowels: we have O, I, U, Y sometimes, but in this case E is out.

Consonants: common ones like L, N, C, D, etc.

Since we need to place R somewhere, we can try R in position 1 or 2 or 5.

Let me think of words that have ""A"" in the third position.

The pattern is: ? ? A ? ?

And one of the other positions must include R.

Also, no S, T, E.

For example:
- If R is at position 1: R ? A ? ?
- If R is at position 2: ? R A ? ?
- If R is at position 5: ? ? A ? R

Also, we might want to use common letters for the other positions to test.

Common letters not excluded: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But for Wordle, we need likely letters.

Perhaps include O or I, L, N, etc.

Let me brainstorm words:

First, suppose R is at position 1: R ? A ? ?

Possible words: ROUND? But O U N D—position 3 is A, not O. Must be A at 3.

So: R _ A _ _

Examples: RABID (R A B I D — but position 3 is A? R A B I D: position1=R, pos2=A? No, we need pos3 to be A. Here pos2 is A, not pos3.

Word structure: letter1, letter2, A, letter4, letter5.

For R at pos1: R ? A ? ?

Like: RADAR? But R A D A R — but we have A at pos2 and pos4? But we need only pos3 known so far, but in RADAR, A is also at pos2 and pos4? But that could be.

But RADAR would have two As? Not necessarily a problem.

But position 3 is D in RADAR? R-A-D-A-R, so position 3 is D, but we need position 3 to be A? I think I'm confusing.

R A D A R:
Pos1: R, pos2: A, pos3: D, pos4: A, pos5: R.

But we need position 3 to be A, so that won't work.

For R in pos1, the word must have pos3=A, so letter1=R, letter2=?, letter3=A, letter4=?, letter5=?

So examples: REALM? But E is out, we cannot use E.

Also, R is used, but that's fine.

Possible words: 
- RICAN? Not a word.
- RACED? E is out.
- RABID: pos: R, A, B, I, D? But pos2 is A, not pos3. We need pos2 to be something, and pos3=A.

For R at pos1: R letter2 A letter4 letter5.

Letter3 is A, that's fixed.

Words: ROYAL — R O Y A L? But that would be pos1=R, pos2=O, pos3=Y, pos4=A, pos5=L? No, we need pos3=A, not Y.

I think I'm messing up positions.

The word should be: position 1: R (or whatever), position 2: ?, position 3: A, position 4: ?, position 5: ?

So for R at position 1: R (1), ? (2), A (3), ? (4), ? (5)

Words like: ""RAPID"" — R,A,P,I,D — positions: 1:R, 2:A, 3:P? That's not A at3.

Standard: in ""RAPID"", positions: 1=R, 2=A, 3=P, 4=I, 5=D. So position 3 is P, not A.

To have position 3=A, the word must have A as the third letter.

For example: ""CRAWL"" — C,R,A,W,L — positions:1=C,2=R,3=A,4=W,5=L. Here pos3=A.

Similarly, ""BRAWL"" — B,R,A,W,L — same pattern? B R A W L: 1=B,2=R,3=A,4=W,5=L.

But R is in the word, and in this case at position 2.

Back to R at position 1.

What word has first letter R and third letter A: so pattern R ? A ? ?

Examples: ""RADIO"" — R,A,D,I,O — but positions:1=R,2=A,3=D — again pos3 is D, not A.

I need words where the third letter is A.

""MANIA"" is M,A,N,I,A — pos3=N? Not A.

Actually, common words: like ""PLANT"" but P,L,A,N,T — here A is position 3.

PLANT: letters P,L,A,N,T — pos1=P,2=L,3=A,4=N,5=T.

Similarly, ""GRANT"" — G,R,A,N,T — 1=G,2=R,3=A,4=N,5=T.

In ""GRANT"", we have R at position 2.

For R at position 1, what about ""RAVEN""? But E is out.

""RALPH"" not common.

Perhaps ""RAMIN""? Not English.

""OASIS"" but O,A,S,I,S — pos3=S? No.

List words with A as third letter.

From memory: BLAND, BRAND, CRAMP, etc.

But for R at position 1: ""RARER""? R,A,R,E,R — but E is out, and A is position 2.

""RAPER"" has E.

""RAZER"" not word.

It's hard to find with R at 1 and A at 3.

""RAYON"" — R,A,Y,O,N? Positions:1=R,2=A,3=Y — not A.

Perhaps I should look for words where R is in another position.

Since R is not at position 4, and position 3 is A, R could be at 1,2, or 5.

Position 4 is unknown, but cannot be R because R is not at 4 based on feedback? Feedback for position 4 of STARE was R but wrong position, so R is not at position 4 for the secret word.

Similarly, position 1 cannot be S, position 2 cannot be T? No, feedback says S was at position 1 of guess and x, meaning no S at all. Similarly T at position 2 of guess and x, meaning T not in word. E not in word.

So secret word: no S, T, E, and has A at position 3, R somewhere not at position 4.

Possible positions for R: 1,2,5.

Since position 4 cannot be R, and position 3 is A, so R at 1,2,5.

Now for second guess, we want to test R in a specific position as well as introduce new letters.

Also, since we have limited tries, we should cover more common letters.

Let's consider positions.

Case 1: R at position 1.
Then word: R ? A ? ? 

What words? Like ""RIVAL"" — R,I,V,A,L — but position 3 is V, not A. 
""ROYAL"" — R,O,Y,A,L — positions:1=R,2=O,3=Y?! No.

""RUMBA""? R,U,M,B,A — positions:1=R,2=U,3=M,4=B,5=A — position 5 is A, not 3.

I think I give up on R at 1 for now; it's rare.

Case 2: R at position 2.
Then word: ? R A ? ?

Examples: CRANE — but C,R,A,N,E — E is out.
PLANE — P,L,A,N,E — E out.
GRAPE — G,R,A,P,E — E out.
BRAVE — B,R,A,V,E — E out.
DRAKE — D,R,A,K,E — E out.

All end with E issue.

""CRACK"" — C,R,A,C,K — but C and K, and double C? Not good.

""DRAMA"" — D,R,A,M,A — positions:1=D,2=R,3=A,4=M,5=A — possible, but A at pos5 too? We don't know.

""BRAND"" — B,R,A,N,D — positions:1=B,2=R,3=A,4=N,5=D — good.

""A"" at position 3, R at position 2.

Similarly, ""GRAND"" — G,R,A,N,D.

""PRANK"" — P,R,A,N,K.

So possible words: BRAND, GRAND, PRANK, etc.

But S,T,E absent, so ""BRAND"" has B,R,A,N,D.

Case 3: R at position 5.
Then word: ? ? A ? R

Examples: ""SUGAR"" but S out, E not used but S out.
""NOVAR"" not word.
""LUNAR"" — L,U,N,A,R? Positions:1=L,2=U,3=N? Not A.
We need position 3=A.

So for R at 5: ? ? A ? R

""POLAR"" — P,O,L,A,R — positions:1=P,2=O,3=L,4=A,5=R — position 3 is L, not A.

""RADAR"" but R at 1 and 5, position 3=D.

""SONAR"" — S O N A R? Position:1=S(out),2=O,3=N,4=A,5=R — position 3 is N, not A.

""MANOR"" — M A N O R — pos1=M,2=A,3=N,4=O,5=R — position 3=N, not A.

It's hard with R at 5 and A at 3.

""VIXEN"" but E out.

Perhaps ""MACAW"" but not with R.

Common word: think of ""OVARY"" — O V A R Y? Positions:1=O,2=V,3=A,4=R,5=Y — but that has R at position 4, but our feedback says R not at position 4? So cannot be, because we have R not at pos4.

Similarly, ""CARRY"" has C,A,R,R,Y but double R and position 3=R? Different.

Sticking with R at position 2 seems easier.

So for the guess, we can assume R at position 2, and try ""BRAND"" for example.

But we don't know for sure, so we should keep options open.

The second guess should help us narrow down.

Current constraints:
- Letter 3: A
- R is in the word, not at position 4.
- S, T, E absent.
- Possible R positions: 1,2,5

I should try a word that has R in position 1 or 2 or 5, and also test other common letters.

Since position 4 cannot be R, we can test letter for position 4.

Also, we should avoid unused letters if possible, but include common ones.

Common letters not used yet: I, O, U, L, N, C, D, M, etc.

For instance, include O, or I or L, N, etc.

Let's list candidate words for second guess.

Possible words with A at pos 3, and R somewhere not 4.

Examples:
- If R at pos 2: ""BRAND"" (B,R,A,N,D)
- ""GRAND"" (G,R,A,N,D)
- ""PRANK"" (P,R,A,N,K)
- ""CRANK"" (C,R,A,N,K) — but C and K
- ""DRAIN"" (D,R,A,I,N) — I is vowel, good

If R at pos 1: hard to find; ""RABIC"" not word; ""RAPID"" not A at 3 as above.

""MAJAR"" not word.

Assume R at pos 2 for common words.

If R at pos 5: ""TONER"" but T out, E out.
""COVER"" E out.
""MINOR"" R at 5, but position 3 N? Not A.

""SUPER"" S out.

Not easy.

So probably R is at position 2 in many cases.

For second guess, I can choose ""BRAND"" to test B, R, N, D.

R is at position 2, which might be correct or not.

But also, ""DRAIN"" has I which is a common vowel.

""DRAIN"": D,R,A,I,N — positions:1=D,2=R,3=A,4=I,5=N

Here R at position 2.

Similarly, ""BRAVO"" — B,R,A,V,O — but O is vowel.

V is less common.

Let's evaluate letters. From the first guess, we know A and R are in, so we can focus on finding their positions.

Specifically, we need to find where R is.

Since it's not at 4, and 3 is A, R must be at 1,2, or 5.

To test this, I can guess a word with R at one of these positions.

For example, if I guess a word with R at position 1, and if it gets a check or minus, I'll know.

Similarly for other positions.

But since we have A fixed at position 3, it might restrict the word.

Another idea: guess a word that has R at position 2, as in ""CRANE"" but E out.

""ORCIN"" not word.

Chose ""GRAPH"" — G,R,A,P,H — position 1=G,2=R,3=A,4=P,5=H — P and H are uncommon, but possible.

But P and H are less common; better to use common letters.

""BRAIN"" — B,R,A,I,N — this is good: B,R,A,I,N

Positions:1=B,2=R,3=A,4=I,5=N

In this guess, position 4 is I, which we can test.

Also, B, I, N are new letters.

Similarly, ""FLAIR"" but L,A,I,R — positions:1=F,2=L,3=A,4=I,5=R — but R at position 5 here, which is an option.

In ""FLAIR"", we have L and F.

But let's compare to ""BRAIN"".

I think ""BRAIN"" is a good choice: it has R at position 2 (which might be correct), A at position 3 fixed, and uses B, I, N – common letters.

If R is not at position 2, say if R is at position 1 or 5, then in this guess, 4=I,5=N, so if R is at 5, position 4 could be something else.

But we'll get feedback.

Feedback would tell if B, I, N are present, and position of R.

The word must not have E,S,T, and has A at 3, R somewhere.

So guess ""BRAIN"".

""TRAIN"" has T, which is out.

No, T is absent.

So ""BRAIN"" (B,R,A,I,N) is valid.

Other options: ""DRAIN"" (D,R,A,I,N), similar.

""GRAIN"" (G,R,A,I,N).

Any of these is fine.

I think I'll go with ""BRAIN"".

To vary letters, since in STARE we had S,T,A,R,E, now B,I,N are new.

N is common.

So my second guess: ""BRAIN"".

But let's confirm the pattern: for ""BRAIN"", position 1=B, 2=R, 3=A, 4=I, 5=N.

A at pos 3 fixed.

R at pos 2.

If the secret word has R at pos 1, for example, then in ""BRAIN"", R is at pos 2, which would show as ""-"" if R is present but not at pos 2? Feedback will show R as ""-"" for wrong position only if R is elsewhere.

But we already know R is in the word, so if we guess R at pos 2, and it's not there, it will show ""-"" and we know it's not at 2.

Similarly, if we guess a word with R at pos 1, but with A at 3.

For example, ""CRAMP"" — C,R,A,M,P — but C at 1, R at 2? No, C,R,A,M,P.

Position:1=C,2=R,3=A,4=M,5=P.

R at pos 2.

Or ""WRACK"" — W,R,A,C,K — same.

No word with R at 1 and A at 3 easily.

So I'll use ""BRAIN"" as second guess.
</think>
<thinking>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""STARE"":  
- S: not in the secret word (x)  
- T: not in the secret word (x)  
- A: correct letter and position (✓), so A is the third letter.  
- R: in the secret word but wrong position (-), so R is present but not at position 4.  
- E: not in the secret word (x)  

Key insights:  
1. The secret word has A as the third letter (pattern: _ _ A _ _).  
2. R is in the word but not in position 4—possible positions are 1, 2, or 5.  
3. S, T, and E are absent—must avoid these letters.  

For the second guess:  
- Prioritize testing the position of R (likely in positions 1, 2, or 5) while keeping A fixed at position 3.  
- Include new common vowels/consonants not yet tested: focus on letters like B, I, N, L, O, etc.  
- Aim for a valid word that fits: ? ? A ? ?  

Good candidates:  
- ""BRAIN"": B R A I N  
  - Positions: B(1), R(2), A(3), I(4), N(5)  
  - Tests R at position 2, which might be correct. Introduces B, I, N—common letters.  
- ""BRAND"": B R A N D  
  - Similar, but N at position 4 and D at 5 (less vowel coverage).  
- ""DRAIN"": D R A I N  
  - Less common starting letter D.  

""BRAIN"" is selected because:  
- It tests R at position 2 (a common spot).  
- Provides information on B (new consonant), I (new vowel), and N (new consonant).  
- Fits all constraints (no S/T/E, A at position 3).  
</thinking>

<guess>BRAIN</guess>",BRAIN,"We have feedback from the first guess ""STARE"":
- S: x (not in the word)
- T: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct letter and correct position, so A is the third letter)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position; since position is wrong and it was fourth, R is in the word but not at position 4)
- E: x (not in the word)

From this, we know:
- The secret word contains an 'A' as the third letter.
- It also contains an 'R', but not as the fourth letter (since position is wrong).
- Letters S, T, E are not in the word at all.

We need to make a second guess that is a 5-letter word with:
- 'A' in the third position (because A is confirmed there).
- Must include 'R' somewhere, but not in the fourth position.
- Should not include S, T, E.
- We can include other common letters to test more possibilities.

Given that S, T, E are out, we have to choose from other letters.

We also need to consider that R is in the word but not in position 4. Possible positions for R: since the word has positions 1,2,3,4,5 and we know position 3 is A, so R cannot be at 3. Possible positions: 1,2,4,5? But position 4 is excluded from the feedback? Wait no: the feedback for R is ""-"", meaning present but not at position 4. So R could be at position 1,2, or 5? But we don't know yet.

Positions: 
1: unknown
2: unknown
3: A
4: unknown, but cannot be R? Actually, from feedback, R is not at 4, but it could be at 1,2, or 5.
Position 5 is possible.

Also, S, T, E are absent, so we avoid those.

What common letters can we use? We might want to test other vowels and consonants.

Other vowels: we have O, I, U, Y sometimes, but in this case E is out.

Consonants: common ones like L, N, C, D, etc.

Since we need to place R somewhere, we can try R in position 1 or 2 or 5.

Let me think of words that have ""A"" in the third position.

The pattern is: ? ? A ? ?

And one of the other positions must include R.

Also, no S, T, E.

For example:
- If R is at position 1: R ? A ? ?
- If R is at position 2: ? R A ? ?
- If R is at position 5: ? ? A ? R

Also, we might want to use common letters for the other positions to test.

Common letters not excluded: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But for Wordle, we need likely letters.

Perhaps include O or I, L, N, etc.

Let me brainstorm words:

First, suppose R is at position 1: R ? A ? ?

Possible words: ROUND? But O U N D—position 3 is A, not O. Must be A at 3.

So: R _ A _ _

Examples: RABID (R A B I D — but position 3 is A? R A B I D: position1=R, pos2=A? No, we need pos3 to be A. Here pos2 is A, not pos3.

Word structure: letter1, letter2, A, letter4, letter5.

For R at pos1: R ? A ? ?

Like: RADAR? But R A D A R — but we have A at pos2 and pos4? But we need only pos3 known so far, but in RADAR, A is also at pos2 and pos4? But that could be.

But RADAR would have two As? Not necessarily a problem.

But position 3 is D in RADAR? R-A-D-A-R, so position 3 is D, but we need position 3 to be A? I think I'm confusing.

R A D A R:
Pos1: R, pos2: A, pos3: D, pos4: A, pos5: R.

But we need position 3 to be A, so that won't work.

For R in pos1, the word must have pos3=A, so letter1=R, letter2=?, letter3=A, letter4=?, letter5=?

So examples: REALM? But E is out, we cannot use E.

Also, R is used, but that's fine.

Possible words: 
- RICAN? Not a word.
- RACED? E is out.
- RABID: pos: R, A, B, I, D? But pos2 is A, not pos3. We need pos2 to be something, and pos3=A.

For R at pos1: R letter2 A letter4 letter5.

Letter3 is A, that's fixed.

Words: ROYAL — R O Y A L? But that would be pos1=R, pos2=O, pos3=Y, pos4=A, pos5=L? No, we need pos3=A, not Y.

I think I'm messing up positions.

The word should be: position 1: R (or whatever), position 2: ?, position 3: A, position 4: ?, position 5: ?

So for R at position 1: R (1), ? (2), A (3), ? (4), ? (5)

Words like: ""RAPID"" — R,A,P,I,D — positions: 1:R, 2:A, 3:P? That's not A at3.

Standard: in ""RAPID"", positions: 1=R, 2=A, 3=P, 4=I, 5=D. So position 3 is P, not A.

To have position 3=A, the word must have A as the third letter.

For example: ""CRAWL"" — C,R,A,W,L — positions:1=C,2=R,3=A,4=W,5=L. Here pos3=A.

Similarly, ""BRAWL"" — B,R,A,W,L — same pattern? B R A W L: 1=B,2=R,3=A,4=W,5=L.

But R is in the word, and in this case at position 2.

Back to R at position 1.

What word has first letter R and third letter A: so pattern R ? A ? ?

Examples: ""RADIO"" — R,A,D,I,O — but positions:1=R,2=A,3=D — again pos3 is D, not A.

I need words where the third letter is A.

""MANIA"" is M,A,N,I,A — pos3=N? Not A.

Actually, common words: like ""PLANT"" but P,L,A,N,T — here A is position 3.

PLANT: letters P,L,A,N,T — pos1=P,2=L,3=A,4=N,5=T.

Similarly, ""GRANT"" — G,R,A,N,T — 1=G,2=R,3=A,4=N,5=T.

In ""GRANT"", we have R at position 2.

For R at position 1, what about ""RAVEN""? But E is out.

""RALPH"" not common.

Perhaps ""RAMIN""? Not English.

""OASIS"" but O,A,S,I,S — pos3=S? No.

List words with A as third letter.

From memory: BLAND, BRAND, CRAMP, etc.

But for R at position 1: ""RARER""? R,A,R,E,R — but E is out, and A is position 2.

""RAPER"" has E.

""RAZER"" not word.

It's hard to find with R at 1 and A at 3.

""RAYON"" — R,A,Y,O,N? Positions:1=R,2=A,3=Y — not A.

Perhaps I should look for words where R is in another position.

Since R is not at position 4, and position 3 is A, R could be at 1,2, or 5.

Position 4 is unknown, but cannot be R because R is not at 4 based on feedback? Feedback for position 4 of STARE was R but wrong position, so R is not at position 4 for the secret word.

Similarly, position 1 cannot be S, position 2 cannot be T? No, feedback says S was at position 1 of guess and x, meaning no S at all. Similarly T at position 2 of guess and x, meaning T not in word. E not in word.

So secret word: no S, T, E, and has A at position 3, R somewhere not at position 4.

Possible positions for R: 1,2,5.

Since position 4 cannot be R, and position 3 is A, so R at 1,2,5.

Now for second guess, we want to test R in a specific position as well as introduce new letters.

Also, since we have limited tries, we should cover more common letters.

Let's consider positions.

Case 1: R at position 1.
Then word: R ? A ? ? 

What words? Like ""RIVAL"" — R,I,V,A,L — but position 3 is V, not A. 
""ROYAL"" — R,O,Y,A,L — positions:1=R,2=O,3=Y?! No.

""RUMBA""? R,U,M,B,A — positions:1=R,2=U,3=M,4=B,5=A — position 5 is A, not 3.

I think I give up on R at 1 for now; it's rare.

Case 2: R at position 2.
Then word: ? R A ? ?

Examples: CRANE — but C,R,A,N,E — E is out.
PLANE — P,L,A,N,E — E out.
GRAPE — G,R,A,P,E — E out.
BRAVE — B,R,A,V,E — E out.
DRAKE — D,R,A,K,E — E out.

All end with E issue.

""CRACK"" — C,R,A,C,K — but C and K, and double C? Not good.

""DRAMA"" — D,R,A,M,A — positions:1=D,2=R,3=A,4=M,5=A — possible, but A at pos5 too? We don't know.

""BRAND"" — B,R,A,N,D — positions:1=B,2=R,3=A,4=N,5=D — good.

""A"" at position 3, R at position 2.

Similarly, ""GRAND"" — G,R,A,N,D.

""PRANK"" — P,R,A,N,K.

So possible words: BRAND, GRAND, PRANK, etc.

But S,T,E absent, so ""BRAND"" has B,R,A,N,D.

Case 3: R at position 5.
Then word: ? ? A ? R

Examples: ""SUGAR"" but S out, E not used but S out.
""NOVAR"" not word.
""LUNAR"" — L,U,N,A,R? Positions:1=L,2=U,3=N? Not A.
We need position 3=A.

So for R at 5: ? ? A ? R

""POLAR"" — P,O,L,A,R — positions:1=P,2=O,3=L,4=A,5=R — position 3 is L, not A.

""RADAR"" but R at 1 and 5, position 3=D.

""SONAR"" — S O N A R? Position:1=S(out),2=O,3=N,4=A,5=R — position 3 is N, not A.

""MANOR"" — M A N O R — pos1=M,2=A,3=N,4=O,5=R — position 3=N, not A.

It's hard with R at 5 and A at 3.

""VIXEN"" but E out.

Perhaps ""MACAW"" but not with R.

Common word: think of ""OVARY"" — O V A R Y? Positions:1=O,2=V,3=A,4=R,5=Y — but that has R at position 4, but our feedback says R not at position 4? So cannot be, because we have R not at pos4.

Similarly, ""CARRY"" has C,A,R,R,Y but double R and position 3=R? Different.

Sticking with R at position 2 seems easier.

So for the guess, we can assume R at position 2, and try ""BRAND"" for example.

But we don't know for sure, so we should keep options open.

The second guess should help us narrow down.

Current constraints:
- Letter 3: A
- R is in the word, not at position 4.
- S, T, E absent.
- Possible R positions: 1,2,5

I should try a word that has R in position 1 or 2 or 5, and also test other common letters.

Since position 4 cannot be R, we can test letter for position 4.

Also, we should avoid unused letters if possible, but include common ones.

Common letters not used yet: I, O, U, L, N, C, D, M, etc.

For instance, include O, or I or L, N, etc.

Let's list candidate words for second guess.

Possible words with A at pos 3, and R somewhere not 4.

Examples:
- If R at pos 2: ""BRAND"" (B,R,A,N,D)
- ""GRAND"" (G,R,A,N,D)
- ""PRANK"" (P,R,A,N,K)
- ""CRANK"" (C,R,A,N,K) — but C and K
- ""DRAIN"" (D,R,A,I,N) — I is vowel, good

If R at pos 1: hard to find; ""RABIC"" not word; ""RAPID"" not A at 3 as above.

""MAJAR"" not word.

Assume R at pos 2 for common words.

If R at pos 5: ""TONER"" but T out, E out.
""COVER"" E out.
""MINOR"" R at 5, but position 3 N? Not A.

""SUPER"" S out.

Not easy.

So probably R is at position 2 in many cases.

For second guess, I can choose ""BRAND"" to test B, R, N, D.

R is at position 2, which might be correct or not.

But also, ""DRAIN"" has I which is a common vowel.

""DRAIN"": D,R,A,I,N — positions:1=D,2=R,3=A,4=I,5=N

Here R at position 2.

Similarly, ""BRAVO"" — B,R,A,V,O — but O is vowel.

V is less common.

Let's evaluate letters. From the first guess, we know A and R are in, so we can focus on finding their positions.

Specifically, we need to find where R is.

Since it's not at 4, and 3 is A, R must be at 1,2, or 5.

To test this, I can guess a word with R at one of these positions.

For example, if I guess a word with R at position 1, and if it gets a check or minus, I'll know.

Similarly for other positions.

But since we have A fixed at position 3, it might restrict the word.

Another idea: guess a word that has R at position 2, as in ""CRANE"" but E out.

""ORCIN"" not word.

Chose ""GRAPH"" — G,R,A,P,H — position 1=G,2=R,3=A,4=P,5=H — P and H are uncommon, but possible.

But P and H are less common; better to use common letters.

""BRAIN"" — B,R,A,I,N — this is good: B,R,A,I,N

Positions:1=B,2=R,3=A,4=I,5=N

In this guess, position 4 is I, which we can test.

Also, B, I, N are new letters.

Similarly, ""FLAIR"" but L,A,I,R — positions:1=F,2=L,3=A,4=I,5=R — but R at position 5 here, which is an option.

In ""FLAIR"", we have L and F.

But let's compare to ""BRAIN"".

I think ""BRAIN"" is a good choice: it has R at position 2 (which might be correct), A at position 3 fixed, and uses B, I, N – common letters.

If R is not at position 2, say if R is at position 1 or 5, then in this guess, 4=I,5=N, so if R is at 5, position 4 could be something else.

But we'll get feedback.

Feedback would tell if B, I, N are present, and position of R.

The word must not have E,S,T, and has A at 3, R somewhere.

So guess ""BRAIN"".

""TRAIN"" has T, which is out.

No, T is absent.

So ""BRAIN"" (B,R,A,I,N) is valid.

Other options: ""DRAIN"" (D,R,A,I,N), similar.

""GRAIN"" (G,R,A,I,N).

Any of these is fine.

I think I'll go with ""BRAIN"".

To vary letters, since in STARE we had S,T,A,R,E, now B,I,N are new.

N is common.

So my second guess: ""BRAIN"".

But let's confirm the pattern: for ""BRAIN"", position 1=B, 2=R, 3=A, 4=I, 5=N.

A at pos 3 fixed.

R at pos 2.

If the secret word has R at pos 1, for example, then in ""BRAIN"", R is at pos 2, which would show as ""-"" if R is present but not at pos 2? Feedback will show R as ""-"" for wrong position only if R is elsewhere.

But we already know R is in the word, so if we guess R at pos 2, and it's not there, it will show ""-"" and we know it's not at 2.

Similarly, if we guess a word with R at pos 1, but with A at 3.

For example, ""CRAMP"" — C,R,A,M,P — but C at 1, R at 2? No, C,R,A,M,P.

Position:1=C,2=R,3=A,4=M,5=P.

R at pos 2.

Or ""WRACK"" — W,R,A,C,K — same.

No word with R at 1 and A at 3 easily.

So I'll use ""BRAIN"" as second guess.<thinking>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""STARE"":  
- S: not in the secret word (x)  
- T: not in the secret word (x)  
- A: correct letter and position (✓), so A is the third letter.  
- R: in the secret word but wrong position (-), so R is present but not at position 4.  
- E: not in the secret word (x)  

Key insights:  
1. The secret word has A as the third letter (pattern: _ _ A _ _).  
2. R is in the word but not in position 4—possible positions are 1, 2, or 5.  
3. S, T, and E are absent—must avoid these letters.  

For the second guess:  
- Prioritize testing the position of R (likely in positions 1, 2, or 5) while keeping A fixed at position 3.  
- Include new common vowels/consonants not yet tested: focus on letters like B, I, N, L, O, etc.  
- Aim for a valid word that fits: ? ? A ? ?  

Good candidates:  
- ""BRAIN"": B R A I N  
  - Positions: B(1), R(2), A(3), I(4), N(5)  
  - Tests R at position 2, which might be correct. Introduces B, I, N—common letters.  
- ""BRAND"": B R A N D  
  - Similar, but N at position 4 and D at 5 (less vowel coverage).  
- ""DRAIN"": D R A I N  
  - Less common starting letter D.  

""BRAIN"" is selected because:  
- It tests R at position 2 (a common spot).  
- Provides information on B (new consonant), I (new vowel), and N (new consonant).  
- Fits all constraints (no S/T/E, A at position 3).

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>First, the game is Wordle, where I need to guess a 5-letter secret word with up to 6 tries. For my first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information I get. That means picking a word with common letters to cover as many possibilities as possible.

I recall that in Wordle, common starting words include words with frequent vowels and consonants. Letters like E, A, R, S, T are very common in English words. So, I should choose a word that includes several of these.

Some popular starting words are ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", ""TRACE"", etc. These cover multiple vowels and common consonants.

Let me think about the vowels: A, E, I, O, U are vowels, and I should try to include at least one or two. Consonants like R, S, T, N, L are also frequent.

For example, ""ROAST"" has R, O, A, S, T – that's good because it includes two vowels (O and A) and common consonants.

""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E – R, A, E are common.

""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E.

""SALET"" is another one, but it's less common.

I want a word that is all unique letters to cover more ground. Duplicate letters would give less information.

Let me list possible first guesses: I can start with ""CRANE"".

Why ""CRANE""? It has C, R, A, N, E. C is not as common as S or T, but E, A, R are very frequent. R is a common consonant, E is the most common vowel, A is also common.

Alternatives: ""RAISE"" has R,A,I,S,E – lots of vowels and common consonants.

""IRATE"" – I,R,A,T,E.

But perhaps ""CRANE"" is a solid choice.

Since the feedback will tell me which letters are in the word and their positions, I should try to cover different positions.

But for the first guess, position isn't as critical because I don't have any information.

I think ""CRANE"" is a balanced choice.

Another common one is ""ADIEU"" which has many vowels – A,D,I,E,U. That might be good for vowel coverage, but consonants are important too.

""SLATE"" seems better: S,L,A,T,E – S and T are very common consonants.

S, L, A, T, E – L is common but not as frequent as S or T.

Let me check letter frequencies in English.

According to data, the most common letters in 5-letter words are: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, etc.

Specifically for Wordle, from past games, E, S, A, O, R, I, L, T are top letters.

So, a word with S, E, A, R, T might be ideal.

""STARE"" – S,T,A,R,E – that includes S, T, A, R, E – all highly common letters.

Similarly, ""ROAST"" was R,O,A,S,T – O instead of E.

E is more frequent than O, so ""STARE"" might be slightly better.

""CRANE"" has C and N, which are less common.

I should go with ""STARE"".

But ""SLATE"" is S,L,A,T,E – L is slightly less common than R.

""STARE"" has R, which is good.

Another popular one is ""CRATE"" – C,R,A,T,E – C is less common.

""RAISE"" – R,A,I,S,E – I is common.

To maximize, perhaps ""STARE"" or ""SALET"".

I think ""STARE"" is a good choice for first guess.

But let me confirm: S, T, A, R, E – position-wise, S and E are often at ends, but it's fine.

Since I have to output in the format, I'll go with ""STARE"".

The response format requires me to think step by step, then output the guess.

So for my thought process: I should choose a starting word that includes common letters to gather as much feedback as possible. The letters S, T, A, R, and E are among the most frequent in English words, so ""STARE"" is an effective first guess. It will help identify correct letters and positions, or at least presence/absence, which can guide subsequent guesses.

I think that's reasonable.<thinking>
For the first guess in Wordle, it's best to choose a word that includes a variety of common vowels and consonants to maximize information from the feedback. Common starting words often use letters like E, A, R, S, T, L, which appear frequently in English words. After considering several options like ""CRANE"" (C, R, A, N, E), ""ROAST"" (R, O, A, S, T), and ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E), I selected ""STARE"" as it includes S, T, A, R, E—all highly common letters. This choice covers multiple vowels (A and E) and high-frequency consonants (S, T, R), increasing the likelihood of identifying letters in the secret word. Since the letters are all unique, it avoids redundancy and provides more useful feedback on letter presence and position.
</thinking>

<guess>STARE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(✓) R(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess ""STARE"":
- S: x (not in the word)
- T: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct letter and correct position, so A is the third letter)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position; since position is wrong and it was fourth, R is in the word but not at position 4)
- E: x (not in the word)

From this, we know:
- The secret word contains an 'A' as the third letter.
- It also contains an 'R', but not as the fourth letter (since position is wrong).
- Letters S, T, E are not in the word at all.

We need to make a second guess that is a 5-letter word with:
- 'A' in the third position (because A is confirmed there).
- Must include 'R' somewhere, but not in the fourth position.
- Should not include S, T, E.
- We can include other common letters to test more possibilities.

Given that S, T, E are out, we have to choose from other letters.

We also need to consider that R is in the word but not in position 4. Possible positions for R: since the word has positions 1,2,3,4,5 and we know position 3 is A, so R cannot be at 3. Possible positions: 1,2,4,5? But position 4 is excluded from the feedback? Wait no: the feedback for R is ""-"", meaning present but not at position 4. So R could be at position 1,2, or 5? But we don't know yet.

Positions: 
1: unknown
2: unknown
3: A
4: unknown, but cannot be R? Actually, from feedback, R is not at 4, but it could be at 1,2, or 5.
Position 5 is possible.

Also, S, T, E are absent, so we avoid those.

What common letters can we use? We might want to test other vowels and consonants.

Other vowels: we have O, I, U, Y sometimes, but in this case E is out.

Consonants: common ones like L, N, C, D, etc.

Since we need to place R somewhere, we can try R in position 1 or 2 or 5.

Let me think of words that have ""A"" in the third position.

The pattern is: ? ? A ? ?

And one of the other positions must include R.

Also, no S, T, E.

For example:
- If R is at position 1: R ? A ? ?
- If R is at position 2: ? R A ? ?
- If R is at position 5: ? ? A ? R

Also, we might want to use common letters for the other positions to test.

Common letters not excluded: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But for Wordle, we need likely letters.

Perhaps include O or I, L, N, etc.

Let me brainstorm words:

First, suppose R is at position 1: R ? A ? ?

Possible words: ROUND? But O U N D—position 3 is A, not O. Must be A at 3.

So: R _ A _ _

Examples: RABID (R A B I D — but position 3 is A? R A B I D: position1=R, pos2=A? No, we need pos3 to be A. Here pos2 is A, not pos3.

Word structure: letter1, letter2, A, letter4, letter5.

For R at pos1: R ? A ? ?

Like: RADAR? But R A D A R — but we have A at pos2 and pos4? But we need only pos3 known so far, but in RADAR, A is also at pos2 and pos4? But that could be.

But RADAR would have two As? Not necessarily a problem.

But position 3 is D in RADAR? R-A-D-A-R, so position 3 is D, but we need position 3 to be A? I think I'm confusing.

R A D A R:
Pos1: R, pos2: A, pos3: D, pos4: A, pos5: R.

But we need position 3 to be A, so that won't work.

For R in pos1, the word must have pos3=A, so letter1=R, letter2=?, letter3=A, letter4=?, letter5=?

So examples: REALM? But E is out, we cannot use E.

Also, R is used, but that's fine.

Possible words: 
- RICAN? Not a word.
- RACED? E is out.
- RABID: pos: R, A, B, I, D? But pos2 is A, not pos3. We need pos2 to be something, and pos3=A.

For R at pos1: R letter2 A letter4 letter5.

Letter3 is A, that's fixed.

Words: ROYAL — R O Y A L? But that would be pos1=R, pos2=O, pos3=Y, pos4=A, pos5=L? No, we need pos3=A, not Y.

I think I'm messing up positions.

The word should be: position 1: R (or whatever), position 2: ?, position 3: A, position 4: ?, position 5: ?

So for R at position 1: R (1), ? (2), A (3), ? (4), ? (5)

Words like: ""RAPID"" — R,A,P,I,D — positions: 1:R, 2:A, 3:P? That's not A at3.

Standard: in ""RAPID"", positions: 1=R, 2=A, 3=P, 4=I, 5=D. So position 3 is P, not A.

To have position 3=A, the word must have A as the third letter.

For example: ""CRAWL"" — C,R,A,W,L — positions:1=C,2=R,3=A,4=W,5=L. Here pos3=A.

Similarly, ""BRAWL"" — B,R,A,W,L — same pattern? B R A W L: 1=B,2=R,3=A,4=W,5=L.

But R is in the word, and in this case at position 2.

Back to R at position 1.

What word has first letter R and third letter A: so pattern R ? A ? ?

Examples: ""RADIO"" — R,A,D,I,O — but positions:1=R,2=A,3=D — again pos3 is D, not A.

I need words where the third letter is A.

""MANIA"" is M,A,N,I,A — pos3=N? Not A.

Actually, common words: like ""PLANT"" but P,L,A,N,T — here A is position 3.

PLANT: letters P,L,A,N,T — pos1=P,2=L,3=A,4=N,5=T.

Similarly, ""GRANT"" — G,R,A,N,T — 1=G,2=R,3=A,4=N,5=T.

In ""GRANT"", we have R at position 2.

For R at position 1, what about ""RAVEN""? But E is out.

""RALPH"" not common.

Perhaps ""RAMIN""? Not English.

""OASIS"" but O,A,S,I,S — pos3=S? No.

List words with A as third letter.

From memory: BLAND, BRAND, CRAMP, etc.

But for R at position 1: ""RARER""? R,A,R,E,R — but E is out, and A is position 2.

""RAPER"" has E.

""RAZER"" not word.

It's hard to find with R at 1 and A at 3.

""RAYON"" — R,A,Y,O,N? Positions:1=R,2=A,3=Y — not A.

Perhaps I should look for words where R is in another position.

Since R is not at position 4, and position 3 is A, R could be at 1,2, or 5.

Position 4 is unknown, but cannot be R because R is not at 4 based on feedback? Feedback for position 4 of STARE was R but wrong position, so R is not at position 4 for the secret word.

Similarly, position 1 cannot be S, position 2 cannot be T? No, feedback says S was at position 1 of guess and x, meaning no S at all. Similarly T at position 2 of guess and x, meaning T not in word. E not in word.

So secret word: no S, T, E, and has A at position 3, R somewhere not at position 4.

Possible positions for R: 1,2,5.

Since position 4 cannot be R, and position 3 is A, so R at 1,2,5.

Now for second guess, we want to test R in a specific position as well as introduce new letters.

Also, since we have limited tries, we should cover more common letters.

Let's consider positions.

Case 1: R at position 1.
Then word: R ? A ? ? 

What words? Like ""RIVAL"" — R,I,V,A,L — but position 3 is V, not A. 
""ROYAL"" — R,O,Y,A,L — positions:1=R,2=O,3=Y?! No.

""RUMBA""? R,U,M,B,A — positions:1=R,2=U,3=M,4=B,5=A — position 5 is A, not 3.

I think I give up on R at 1 for now; it's rare.

Case 2: R at position 2.
Then word: ? R A ? ?

Examples: CRANE — but C,R,A,N,E — E is out.
PLANE — P,L,A,N,E — E out.
GRAPE — G,R,A,P,E — E out.
BRAVE — B,R,A,V,E — E out.
DRAKE — D,R,A,K,E — E out.

All end with E issue.

""CRACK"" — C,R,A,C,K — but C and K, and double C? Not good.

""DRAMA"" — D,R,A,M,A — positions:1=D,2=R,3=A,4=M,5=A — possible, but A at pos5 too? We don't know.

""BRAND"" — B,R,A,N,D — positions:1=B,2=R,3=A,4=N,5=D — good.

""A"" at position 3, R at position 2.

Similarly, ""GRAND"" — G,R,A,N,D.

""PRANK"" — P,R,A,N,K.

So possible words: BRAND, GRAND, PRANK, etc.

But S,T,E absent, so ""BRAND"" has B,R,A,N,D.

Case 3: R at position 5.
Then word: ? ? A ? R

Examples: ""SUGAR"" but S out, E not used but S out.
""NOVAR"" not word.
""LUNAR"" — L,U,N,A,R? Positions:1=L,2=U,3=N? Not A.
We need position 3=A.

So for R at 5: ? ? A ? R

""POLAR"" — P,O,L,A,R — positions:1=P,2=O,3=L,4=A,5=R — position 3 is L, not A.

""RADAR"" but R at 1 and 5, position 3=D.

""SONAR"" — S O N A R? Position:1=S(out),2=O,3=N,4=A,5=R — position 3 is N, not A.

""MANOR"" — M A N O R — pos1=M,2=A,3=N,4=O,5=R — position 3=N, not A.

It's hard with R at 5 and A at 3.

""VIXEN"" but E out.

Perhaps ""MACAW"" but not with R.

Common word: think of ""OVARY"" — O V A R Y? Positions:1=O,2=V,3=A,4=R,5=Y — but that has R at position 4, but our feedback says R not at position 4? So cannot be, because we have R not at pos4.

Similarly, ""CARRY"" has C,A,R,R,Y but double R and position 3=R? Different.

Sticking with R at position 2 seems easier.

So for the guess, we can assume R at position 2, and try ""BRAND"" for example.

But we don't know for sure, so we should keep options open.

The second guess should help us narrow down.

Current constraints:
- Letter 3: A
- R is in the word, not at position 4.
- S, T, E absent.
- Possible R positions: 1,2,5

I should try a word that has R in position 1 or 2 or 5, and also test other common letters.

Since position 4 cannot be R, we can test letter for position 4.

Also, we should avoid unused letters if possible, but include common ones.

Common letters not used yet: I, O, U, L, N, C, D, M, etc.

For instance, include O, or I or L, N, etc.

Let's list candidate words for second guess.

Possible words with A at pos 3, and R somewhere not 4.

Examples:
- If R at pos 2: ""BRAND"" (B,R,A,N,D)
- ""GRAND"" (G,R,A,N,D)
- ""PRANK"" (P,R,A,N,K)
- ""CRANK"" (C,R,A,N,K) — but C and K
- ""DRAIN"" (D,R,A,I,N) — I is vowel, good

If R at pos 1: hard to find; ""RABIC"" not word; ""RAPID"" not A at 3 as above.

""MAJAR"" not word.

Assume R at pos 2 for common words.

If R at pos 5: ""TONER"" but T out, E out.
""COVER"" E out.
""MINOR"" R at 5, but position 3 N? Not A.

""SUPER"" S out.

Not easy.

So probably R is at position 2 in many cases.

For second guess, I can choose ""BRAND"" to test B, R, N, D.

R is at position 2, which might be correct or not.

But also, ""DRAIN"" has I which is a common vowel.

""DRAIN"": D,R,A,I,N — positions:1=D,2=R,3=A,4=I,5=N

Here R at position 2.

Similarly, ""BRAVO"" — B,R,A,V,O — but O is vowel.

V is less common.

Let's evaluate letters. From the first guess, we know A and R are in, so we can focus on finding their positions.

Specifically, we need to find where R is.

Since it's not at 4, and 3 is A, R must be at 1,2, or 5.

To test this, I can guess a word with R at one of these positions.

For example, if I guess a word with R at position 1, and if it gets a check or minus, I'll know.

Similarly for other positions.

But since we have A fixed at position 3, it might restrict the word.

Another idea: guess a word that has R at position 2, as in ""CRANE"" but E out.

""ORCIN"" not word.

Chose ""GRAPH"" — G,R,A,P,H — position 1=G,2=R,3=A,4=P,5=H — P and H are uncommon, but possible.

But P and H are less common; better to use common letters.

""BRAIN"" — B,R,A,I,N — this is good: B,R,A,I,N

Positions:1=B,2=R,3=A,4=I,5=N

In this guess, position 4 is I, which we can test.

Also, B, I, N are new letters.

Similarly, ""FLAIR"" but L,A,I,R — positions:1=F,2=L,3=A,4=I,5=R — but R at position 5 here, which is an option.

In ""FLAIR"", we have L and F.

But let's compare to ""BRAIN"".

I think ""BRAIN"" is a good choice: it has R at position 2 (which might be correct), A at position 3 fixed, and uses B, I, N – common letters.

If R is not at position 2, say if R is at position 1 or 5, then in this guess, 4=I,5=N, so if R is at 5, position 4 could be something else.

But we'll get feedback.

Feedback would tell if B, I, N are present, and position of R.

The word must not have E,S,T, and has A at 3, R somewhere.

So guess ""BRAIN"".

""TRAIN"" has T, which is out.

No, T is absent.

So ""BRAIN"" (B,R,A,I,N) is valid.

Other options: ""DRAIN"" (D,R,A,I,N), similar.

""GRAIN"" (G,R,A,I,N).

Any of these is fine.

I think I'll go with ""BRAIN"".

To vary letters, since in STARE we had S,T,A,R,E, now B,I,N are new.

N is common.

So my second guess: ""BRAIN"".

But let's confirm the pattern: for ""BRAIN"", position 1=B, 2=R, 3=A, 4=I, 5=N.

A at pos 3 fixed.

R at pos 2.

If the secret word has R at pos 1, for example, then in ""BRAIN"", R is at pos 2, which would show as ""-"" if R is present but not at pos 2? Feedback will show R as ""-"" for wrong position only if R is elsewhere.

But we already know R is in the word, so if we guess R at pos 2, and it's not there, it will show ""-"" and we know it's not at 2.

Similarly, if we guess a word with R at pos 1, but with A at 3.

For example, ""CRAMP"" — C,R,A,M,P — but C at 1, R at 2? No, C,R,A,M,P.

Position:1=C,2=R,3=A,4=M,5=P.

R at pos 2.

Or ""WRACK"" — W,R,A,C,K — same.

No word with R at 1 and A at 3 easily.

So I'll use ""BRAIN"" as second guess.<thinking>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""STARE"":  
- S: not in the secret word (x)  
- T: not in the secret word (x)  
- A: correct letter and position (✓), so A is the third letter.  
- R: in the secret word but wrong position (-), so R is present but not at position 4.  
- E: not in the secret word (x)  

Key insights:  
1. The secret word has A as the third letter (pattern: _ _ A _ _).  
2. R is in the word but not in position 4—possible positions are 1, 2, or 5.  
3. S, T, and E are absent—must avoid these letters.  

For the second guess:  
- Prioritize testing the position of R (likely in positions 1, 2, or 5) while keeping A fixed at position 3.  
- Include new common vowels/consonants not yet tested: focus on letters like B, I, N, L, O, etc.  
- Aim for a valid word that fits: ? ? A ? ?  

Good candidates:  
- ""BRAIN"": B R A I N  
  - Positions: B(1), R(2), A(3), I(4), N(5)  
  - Tests R at position 2, which might be correct. Introduces B, I, N—common letters.  
- ""BRAND"": B R A N D  
  - Similar, but N at position 4 and D at 5 (less vowel coverage).  
- ""DRAIN"": D R A I N  
  - Less common starting letter D.  

""BRAIN"" is selected because:  
- It tests R at position 2 (a common spot).  
- Provides information on B (new consonant), I (new vowel), and N (new consonant).  
- Fits all constraints (no S/T/E, A at position 3).

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information I get. That means picking a word with common letters to cover as many possibilities as possible.\n\nI recall that in Wordle, common starting words include words with frequent vowels and consonants. Letters like E, A, R, S, T are very common in English words. So, I should choose a word that includes several of these.\n\nSome popular starting words are ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", ""TRACE"", etc. These cover multiple vowels and common consonants.\n\nLet me think about the vowels: A, E, I, O, U are vowels, and I should try to include at least one or two. Consonants like R, S, T, N, L are also frequent.\n\nFor example, ""ROAST"" has R, O, A, S, T – that\'s good because it includes two vowels (O and A) and common consonants.\n\n""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E – R, A, E are common.\n\n""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E.\n\n""SALET"" is another one, but it\'s less common.\n\nI want a word that is all unique letters to cover more ground. Duplicate letters would give less information.\n\nLet me list possible first guesses: I can start with ""CRANE"".\n\nWhy ""CRANE""? It has C, R, A, N, E. C is not as common as S or T, but E, A, R are very frequent. R is a common consonant, E is the most common vowel, A is also common.\n\nAlternatives: ""RAISE"" has R,A,I,S,E – lots of vowels and common consonants.\n\n""IRATE"" – I,R,A,T,E.\n\nBut perhaps ""CRANE"" is a solid choice.\n\nSince the feedback will tell me which letters are in the word and their positions, I should try to cover different positions.\n\nBut for the first guess, position isn\'t as critical because I don\'t have any information.\n\nI think ""CRANE"" is a balanced choice.\n\nAnother common one is ""ADIEU"" which has many vowels – A,D,I,E,U. That might be good for vowel coverage, but consonants are important too.\n\n""SLATE"" seems better: S,L,A,T,E – S and T are very common consonants.\n\nS, L, A, T, E – L is common but not as frequent as S or T.\n\nLet me check letter frequencies in English.\n\nAccording to data, the most common letters in 5-letter words are: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, etc.\n\nSpecifically for Wordle, from past games, E, S, A, O, R, I, L, T are top letters.\n\nSo, a word with S, E, A, R, T might be ideal.\n\n""STARE"" – S,T,A,R,E – that includes S, T, A, R, E – all highly common letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""ROAST"" was R,O,A,S,T – O instead of E.\n\nE is more frequent than O, so ""STARE"" might be slightly better.\n\n""CRANE"" has C and N, which are less common.\n\nI should go with ""STARE"".\n\nBut ""SLATE"" is S,L,A,T,E – L is slightly less common than R.\n\n""STARE"" has R, which is good.\n\nAnother popular one is ""CRATE"" – C,R,A,T,E – C is less common.\n\n""RAISE"" – R,A,I,S,E – I is common.\n\nTo maximize, perhaps ""STARE"" or ""SALET"".\n\nI think ""STARE"" is a good choice for first guess.\n\nBut let me confirm: S, T, A, R, E – position-wise, S and E are often at ends, but it\'s fine.\n\nSince I have to output in the format, I\'ll go with ""STARE"".\n\nThe response format requires me to think step by step, then output the guess.\n\nSo for my thought process: I should choose a starting word that includes common letters to gather as much feedback as possible. The letters S, T, A, R, and E are among the most frequent in English words, so ""STARE"" is an effective first guess. It will help identify correct letters and positions, or at least presence/absence, which can guide subsequent guesses.\n\nI think that\'s reasonable.<thinking>\nFor the first guess in Wordle, it\'s best to choose a word that includes a variety of common vowels and consonants to maximize information from the feedback. Common starting words often use letters like E, A, R, S, T, L, which appear frequently in English words. After considering several options like ""CRANE"" (C, R, A, N, E), ""ROAST"" (R, O, A, S, T), and ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E), I selected ""STARE"" as it includes S, T, A, R, E—all highly common letters. This choice covers multiple vowels (A and E) and high-frequency consonants (S, T, R), increasing the likelihood of identifying letters in the secret word. Since the letters are all unique, it avoids redundancy and provides more useful feedback on letter presence and position.\n</thinking>\n\n<guess>STARE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(✓) R(-) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from the first guess ""STARE"":\n- S: x (not in the word)\n- T: x (not in the word)\n- A: ✓ (correct letter and correct position, so A is the third letter)\n- R: - (in the word but wrong position; since position is wrong and it was fourth, R is in the word but not at position 4)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nFrom this, we know:\n- The secret word contains an \'A\' as the third letter.\n- It also contains an \'R\', but not as the fourth letter (since position is wrong).\n- Letters S, T, E are not in the word at all.\n\nWe need to make a second guess that is a 5-letter word with:\n- \'A\' in the third position (because A is confirmed there).\n- Must include \'R\' somewhere, but not in the fourth position.\n- Should not include S, T, E.\n- We can include other common letters to test more possibilities.\n\nGiven that S, T, E are out, we have to choose from other letters.\n\nWe also need to consider that R is in the word but not in position 4. Possible positions for R: since the word has positions 1,2,3,4,5 and we know position 3 is A, so R cannot be at 3. Possible positions: 1,2,4,5? But position 4 is excluded from the feedback? Wait no: the feedback for R is ""-"", meaning present but not at position 4. So R could be at position 1,2, or 5? But we don\'t know yet.\n\nPositions: \n1: unknown\n2: unknown\n3: A\n4: unknown, but cannot be R? Actually, from feedback, R is not at 4, but it could be at 1,2, or 5.\nPosition 5 is possible.\n\nAlso, S, T, E are absent, so we avoid those.\n\nWhat common letters can we use? We might want to test other vowels and consonants.\n\nOther vowels: we have O, I, U, Y sometimes, but in this case E is out.\n\nConsonants: common ones like L, N, C, D, etc.\n\nSince we need to place R somewhere, we can try R in position 1 or 2 or 5.\n\nLet me think of words that have ""A"" in the third position.\n\nThe pattern is: ? ? A ? ?\n\nAnd one of the other positions must include R.\n\nAlso, no S, T, E.\n\nFor example:\n- If R is at position 1: R ? A ? ?\n- If R is at position 2: ? R A ? ?\n- If R is at position 5: ? ? A ? R\n\nAlso, we might want to use common letters for the other positions to test.\n\nCommon letters not excluded: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But for Wordle, we need likely letters.\n\nPerhaps include O or I, L, N, etc.\n\nLet me brainstorm words:\n\nFirst, suppose R is at position 1: R ? A ? ?\n\nPossible words: ROUND? But O U N D—position 3 is A, not O. Must be A at 3.\n\nSo: R _ A _ _\n\nExamples: RABID (R A B I D — but position 3 is A? R A B I D: position1=R, pos2=A? No, we need pos3 to be A. Here pos2 is A, not pos3.\n\nWord structure: letter1, letter2, A, letter4, letter5.\n\nFor R at pos1: R ? A ? ?\n\nLike: RADAR? But R A D A R — but we have A at pos2 and pos4? But we need only pos3 known so far, but in RADAR, A is also at pos2 and pos4? But that could be.\n\nBut RADAR would have two As? Not necessarily a problem.\n\nBut position 3 is D in RADAR? R-A-D-A-R, so position 3 is D, but we need position 3 to be A? I think I\'m confusing.\n\nR A D A R:\nPos1: R, pos2: A, pos3: D, pos4: A, pos5: R.\n\nBut we need position 3 to be A, so that won\'t work.\n\nFor R in pos1, the word must have pos3=A, so letter1=R, letter2=?, letter3=A, letter4=?, letter5=?\n\nSo examples: REALM? But E is out, we cannot use E.\n\nAlso, R is used, but that\'s fine.\n\nPossible words: \n- RICAN? Not a word.\n- RACED? E is out.\n- RABID: pos: R, A, B, I, D? But pos2 is A, not pos3. We need pos2 to be something, and pos3=A.\n\nFor R at pos1: R letter2 A letter4 letter5.\n\nLetter3 is A, that\'s fixed.\n\nWords: ROYAL — R O Y A L? But that would be pos1=R, pos2=O, pos3=Y, pos4=A, pos5=L? No, we need pos3=A, not Y.\n\nI think I\'m messing up positions.\n\nThe word should be: position 1: R (or whatever), position 2: ?, position 3: A, position 4: ?, position 5: ?\n\nSo for R at position 1: R (1), ? (2), A (3), ? (4), ? (5)\n\nWords like: ""RAPID"" — R,A,P,I,D — positions: 1:R, 2:A, 3:P? That\'s not A at3.\n\nStandard: in ""RAPID"", positions: 1=R, 2=A, 3=P, 4=I, 5=D. So position 3 is P, not A.\n\nTo have position 3=A, the word must have A as the third letter.\n\nFor example: ""CRAWL"" — C,R,A,W,L — positions:1=C,2=R,3=A,4=W,5=L. Here pos3=A.\n\nSimilarly, ""BRAWL"" — B,R,A,W,L — same pattern? B R A W L: 1=B,2=R,3=A,4=W,5=L.\n\nBut R is in the word, and in this case at position 2.\n\nBack to R at position 1.\n\nWhat word has first letter R and third letter A: so pattern R ? A ? ?\n\nExamples: ""RADIO"" — R,A,D,I,O — but positions:1=R,2=A,3=D — again pos3 is D, not A.\n\nI need words where the third letter is A.\n\n""MANIA"" is M,A,N,I,A — pos3=N? Not A.\n\nActually, common words: like ""PLANT"" but P,L,A,N,T — here A is position 3.\n\nPLANT: letters P,L,A,N,T — pos1=P,2=L,3=A,4=N,5=T.\n\nSimilarly, ""GRANT"" — G,R,A,N,T — 1=G,2=R,3=A,4=N,5=T.\n\nIn ""GRANT"", we have R at position 2.\n\nFor R at position 1, what about ""RAVEN""? But E is out.\n\n""RALPH"" not common.\n\nPerhaps ""RAMIN""? Not English.\n\n""OASIS"" but O,A,S,I,S — pos3=S? No.\n\nList words with A as third letter.\n\nFrom memory: BLAND, BRAND, CRAMP, etc.\n\nBut for R at position 1: ""RARER""? R,A,R,E,R — but E is out, and A is position 2.\n\n""RAPER"" has E.\n\n""RAZER"" not word.\n\nIt\'s hard to find with R at 1 and A at 3.\n\n""RAYON"" — R,A,Y,O,N? Positions:1=R,2=A,3=Y — not A.\n\nPerhaps I should look for words where R is in another position.\n\nSince R is not at position 4, and position 3 is A, R could be at 1,2, or 5.\n\nPosition 4 is unknown, but cannot be R because R is not at 4 based on feedback? Feedback for position 4 of STARE was R but wrong position, so R is not at position 4 for the secret word.\n\nSimilarly, position 1 cannot be S, position 2 cannot be T? No, feedback says S was at position 1 of guess and x, meaning no S at all. Similarly T at position 2 of guess and x, meaning T not in word. E not in word.\n\nSo secret word: no S, T, E, and has A at position 3, R somewhere not at position 4.\n\nPossible positions for R: 1,2,5.\n\nSince position 4 cannot be R, and position 3 is A, so R at 1,2,5.\n\nNow for second guess, we want to test R in a specific position as well as introduce new letters.\n\nAlso, since we have limited tries, we should cover more common letters.\n\nLet\'s consider positions.\n\nCase 1: R at position 1.\nThen word: R ? A ? ? \n\nWhat words? Like ""RIVAL"" — R,I,V,A,L — but position 3 is V, not A. \n""ROYAL"" — R,O,Y,A,L — positions:1=R,2=O,3=Y?! No.\n\n""RUMBA""? R,U,M,B,A — positions:1=R,2=U,3=M,4=B,5=A — position 5 is A, not 3.\n\nI think I give up on R at 1 for now; it\'s rare.\n\nCase 2: R at position 2.\nThen word: ? R A ? ?\n\nExamples: CRANE — but C,R,A,N,E — E is out.\nPLANE — P,L,A,N,E — E out.\nGRAPE — G,R,A,P,E — E out.\nBRAVE — B,R,A,V,E — E out.\nDRAKE — D,R,A,K,E — E out.\n\nAll end with E issue.\n\n""CRACK"" — C,R,A,C,K — but C and K, and double C? Not good.\n\n""DRAMA"" — D,R,A,M,A — positions:1=D,2=R,3=A,4=M,5=A — possible, but A at pos5 too? We don\'t know.\n\n""BRAND"" — B,R,A,N,D — positions:1=B,2=R,3=A,4=N,5=D — good.\n\n""A"" at position 3, R at position 2.\n\nSimilarly, ""GRAND"" — G,R,A,N,D.\n\n""PRANK"" — P,R,A,N,K.\n\nSo possible words: BRAND, GRAND, PRANK, etc.\n\nBut S,T,E absent, so ""BRAND"" has B,R,A,N,D.\n\nCase 3: R at position 5.\nThen word: ? ? A ? R\n\nExamples: ""SUGAR"" but S out, E not used but S out.\n""NOVAR"" not word.\n""LUNAR"" — L,U,N,A,R? Positions:1=L,2=U,3=N? Not A.\nWe need position 3=A.\n\nSo for R at 5: ? ? A ? R\n\n""POLAR"" — P,O,L,A,R — positions:1=P,2=O,3=L,4=A,5=R — position 3 is L, not A.\n\n""RADAR"" but R at 1 and 5, position 3=D.\n\n""SONAR"" — S O N A R? Position:1=S(out),2=O,3=N,4=A,5=R — position 3 is N, not A.\n\n""MANOR"" — M A N O R — pos1=M,2=A,3=N,4=O,5=R — position 3=N, not A.\n\nIt\'s hard with R at 5 and A at 3.\n\n""VIXEN"" but E out.\n\nPerhaps ""MACAW"" but not with R.\n\nCommon word: think of ""OVARY"" — O V A R Y? Positions:1=O,2=V,3=A,4=R,5=Y — but that has R at position 4, but our feedback says R not at position 4? So cannot be, because we have R not at pos4.\n\nSimilarly, ""CARRY"" has C,A,R,R,Y but double R and position 3=R? Different.\n\nSticking with R at position 2 seems easier.\n\nSo for the guess, we can assume R at position 2, and try ""BRAND"" for example.\n\nBut we don\'t know for sure, so we should keep options open.\n\nThe second guess should help us narrow down.\n\nCurrent constraints:\n- Letter 3: A\n- R is in the word, not at position 4.\n- S, T, E absent.\n- Possible R positions: 1,2,5\n\nI should try a word that has R in position 1 or 2 or 5, and also test other common letters.\n\nSince position 4 cannot be R, we can test letter for position 4.\n\nAlso, we should avoid unused letters if possible, but include common ones.\n\nCommon letters not used yet: I, O, U, L, N, C, D, M, etc.\n\nFor instance, include O, or I or L, N, etc.\n\nLet\'s list candidate words for second guess.\n\nPossible words with A at pos 3, and R somewhere not 4.\n\nExamples:\n- If R at pos 2: ""BRAND"" (B,R,A,N,D)\n- ""GRAND"" (G,R,A,N,D)\n- ""PRANK"" (P,R,A,N,K)\n- ""CRANK"" (C,R,A,N,K) — but C and K\n- ""DRAIN"" (D,R,A,I,N) — I is vowel, good\n\nIf R at pos 1: hard to find; ""RABIC"" not word; ""RAPID"" not A at 3 as above.\n\n""MAJAR"" not word.\n\nAssume R at pos 2 for common words.\n\nIf R at pos 5: ""TONER"" but T out, E out.\n""COVER"" E out.\n""MINOR"" R at 5, but position 3 N? Not A.\n\n""SUPER"" S out.\n\nNot easy.\n\nSo probably R is at position 2 in many cases.\n\nFor second guess, I can choose ""BRAND"" to test B, R, N, D.\n\nR is at position 2, which might be correct or not.\n\nBut also, ""DRAIN"" has I which is a common vowel.\n\n""DRAIN"": D,R,A,I,N — positions:1=D,2=R,3=A,4=I,5=N\n\nHere R at position 2.\n\nSimilarly, ""BRAVO"" — B,R,A,V,O — but O is vowel.\n\nV is less common.\n\nLet\'s evaluate letters. From the first guess, we know A and R are in, so we can focus on finding their positions.\n\nSpecifically, we need to find where R is.\n\nSince it\'s not at 4, and 3 is A, R must be at 1,2, or 5.\n\nTo test this, I can guess a word with R at one of these positions.\n\nFor example, if I guess a word with R at position 1, and if it gets a check or minus, I\'ll know.\n\nSimilarly for other positions.\n\nBut since we have A fixed at position 3, it might restrict the word.\n\nAnother idea: guess a word that has R at position 2, as in ""CRANE"" but E out.\n\n""ORCIN"" not word.\n\nChose ""GRAPH"" — G,R,A,P,H — position 1=G,2=R,3=A,4=P,5=H — P and H are uncommon, but possible.\n\nBut P and H are less common; better to use common letters.\n\n""BRAIN"" — B,R,A,I,N — this is good: B,R,A,I,N\n\nPositions:1=B,2=R,3=A,4=I,5=N\n\nIn this guess, position 4 is I, which we can test.\n\nAlso, B, I, N are new letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""FLAIR"" but L,A,I,R — positions:1=F,2=L,3=A,4=I,5=R — but R at position 5 here, which is an option.\n\nIn ""FLAIR"", we have L and F.\n\nBut let\'s compare to ""BRAIN"".\n\nI think ""BRAIN"" is a good choice: it has R at position 2 (which might be correct), A at position 3 fixed, and uses B, I, N – common letters.\n\nIf R is not at position 2, say if R is at position 1 or 5, then in this guess, 4=I,5=N, so if R is at 5, position 4 could be something else.\n\nBut we\'ll get feedback.\n\nFeedback would tell if B, I, N are present, and position of R.\n\nThe word must not have E,S,T, and has A at 3, R somewhere.\n\nSo guess ""BRAIN"".\n\n""TRAIN"" has T, which is out.\n\nNo, T is absent.\n\nSo ""BRAIN"" (B,R,A,I,N) is valid.\n\nOther options: ""DRAIN"" (D,R,A,I,N), similar.\n\n""GRAIN"" (G,R,A,I,N).\n\nAny of these is fine.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""BRAIN"".\n\nTo vary letters, since in STARE we had S,T,A,R,E, now B,I,N are new.\n\nN is common.\n\nSo my second guess: ""BRAIN"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm the pattern: for ""BRAIN"", position 1=B, 2=R, 3=A, 4=I, 5=N.\n\nA at pos 3 fixed.\n\nR at pos 2.\n\nIf the secret word has R at pos 1, for example, then in ""BRAIN"", R is at pos 2, which would show as ""-"" if R is present but not at pos 2? Feedback will show R as ""-"" for wrong position only if R is elsewhere.\n\nBut we already know R is in the word, so if we guess R at pos 2, and it\'s not there, it will show ""-"" and we know it\'s not at 2.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess a word with R at pos 1, but with A at 3.\n\nFor example, ""CRAMP"" — C,R,A,M,P — but C at 1, R at 2? No, C,R,A,M,P.\n\nPosition:1=C,2=R,3=A,4=M,5=P.\n\nR at pos 2.\n\nOr ""WRACK"" — W,R,A,C,K — same.\n\nNo word with R at 1 and A at 3 easily.\n\nSo I\'ll use ""BRAIN"" as second guess.<thinking>\nBased on the feedback from the first guess ""STARE"":  \n- S: not in the secret word (x)  \n- T: not in the secret word (x)  \n- A: correct letter and position (✓), so A is the third letter.  \n- R: in the secret word but wrong position (-), so R is present but not at position 4.  \n- E: not in the secret word (x)  \n\nKey insights:  \n1.

S, T, and E are absent—must avoid these letters.  \n\nFor the second guess:  \n- Prioritize testing the position of R (likely in positions 1, 2, or 5) while keeping A fixed at position 3.  \n- Include new common vowels/consonants not yet tested: focus on letters like B, I, N, L, O, etc.  \n- Aim for a valid word that fits: ? ?

We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: STARE
- S: x (not in word)
- T: x (not in word)
- A: ✓ (correct letter and position, so position 3 is A)
- R: - (in word but wrong position, so R is in the word but not at position 4)
- E: x (not in word)

Second guess: BRAIN
- B: x (not in word)
- R: ✓ (correct letter and position, so position 2 is R)
- A: ✓ (correct letter and position, so position 3 is A, which we already knew)
- I: x (not in word)
- N: - (in word but wrong position, so N is in the word but not at position 5)

Now, combining the information:

1. Position 2 is R (from second guess, R is correct at position 2)
2. Position 3 is A (from first guess, confirmed again)
3. R is in the word, but we now know it is at position 2, so the earlier feedback about R not at position 4 is consistent.
4. N is in the word but not at position 5.
5. S, T, E, B, I are not in the word.

So the secret word has:
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: A
- N is present, but not at position 5.
- No S, T, E, B, I.

The pattern so far: _ R A _ _

We need to find the first, fourth, and fifth letters.

N is in the word but not at position 5, so it must be at position 1 or 4? Positions are 1,2,3,4,5. Position 2 and 3 are taken by R and A, so N can be at position 1 or 4.

But position 4 is available, and position 1 is available.

Also, we need to avoid S, T, E, B, I.

Now, for the third guess, we should try to find a word that fits the pattern _ R A _ _ and includes N in position 1 or 4, and tests other common letters.

Since N is not at position 5, if we put N at position 4, we can test that.

Alternatively, we can put N at position 1 and see.

But we need to cover more letters.

Common letters left: O, U, L, D, C, M, P, etc.

Vowels: O, U (since A is used, and E, I are out).

Consonants: L, N, C, D, M, P, G, K, etc.

Now, the word must have N in it, at position 1 or 4.

Let's consider possibilities.

First, if N is at position 1: then word is N R A _ _

What can the last two be? And must not have S,T,E,B,I.

Examples: ""NRAIL"" not a word.

""NRAPE"" not and E out.

""DRANK"" but D is possible, but position 1 is N, not D.

N R A _ _

""CRANE"" but C and E out.

""GRAND"" but G, and D at 5? N R A ? ?

""BRAND"" but B out.

""PRANK"" P R A N K, but that has R at 2, A at 3, N at 4, K at 5. But if N is at position 4, then for N R A _ _, it would be position 1=N, 2=R, 3=A, 4=?, 5=?

So for example, ""NRAWL"" not word.

""FRAUD"" F R A U D — positions:1=F,2=R,3=A,4=U,5=D — that could be.

""GRAVY"" G R A V Y — 1=G,2=R,3=A,4=V,5=Y.

But N is not in these, but we need N in the word.

If N is at position 1, then ""NRA something"" is hard.

""CRAMP"" but C and P.

Perhaps N at position 4 is more common.

Pattern: _ R A N _

Then position 1 and 5 to fill.

With no S,T,E,B,I.

Common words: ""CRANE"" but E out.

""DRANK"" — D R A N K — positions:1=D,2=R,3=A,4=N,5=K — N at position 4.

""FRANK"" — F R A N K — similar.

""PRANK"" — P R A N K.

""TRANK"" not common.

""WRANG"" not word.

So ""DRANK"", ""FRANK"", ""PRANK"" are candidates.

But we need to avoid B and I, which we are.

In these, N is at position 4, which is consistent with the feedback that N is not at position 5.

Now, position 5 is K in these words.

But we don't know if K is in the word.

For the third guess, we can try one of these to test.

But we also need to test other letters.

Since we have _ R A _ _, and N must be at 1 or 4.

If we try a word with N at position 4, and a new letter at position 1 and 5.

For example, ""CRONY"" but C and O, and position 4 is O? Not N.

""DRONE"" E out.

""GROAN"" — G R O A N? Positions:1=G,2=R,3=O? But position 3 must be A, not O.

Pattern must have A at 3, so _ R A _ _

""GROAN"" is G,R,O,A,N — positions:1=G,2=R,3=O,4=A,5=N — but position 3 is O, not A, so invalid.

So back to _ R A N _ pattern.

Words: DRANK, FRANK, PRANK, WRACK? W R A C K — but C at 4, not N.

WRACK has no N.

So only if we have N at 4.

Other words: ""URBAN"" — U R B A N — positions:1=U,2=R,3=B? Not A, position 3 is B, not A.

""BARON"" but B out, and position 3 O? Not A.

So the common ones are DRANK, FRANK, PRANK.

Also, ""CROWN"" but position 3 O.

Not.

""BRAWN"" B out, and position 3 A? B R A W N — positions:1=B(out),2=R,3=A,4=W,5=N — but B is out, so not possible.

Similarly, ""DRAWN"" — D R A W N — positions:1=D,2=R,3=A,4=W,5=N — this could be, but W and N.

N at position 5? But feedback says N is not at position 5, so in ""DRAWN"", N is at position 5, which is invalid because N cannot be at position 5.

Feedback from BRAIN: N is in word but not at position 5, so N cannot be at position 5.

Therefore, in the secret word, N is not at position 5, so for pattern _ R A _ _, N must be at position 1 or 4.

If at position 4, then word is _ R A N _

If at position 1, then N R A _ _

But N R A _ _ words are rare, like ""NRA something"", but not common English words.

For example, ""NRAKA"" not word.

So probably N is at position 4.

Thus, pattern: _ R A N _

Now, position 1 and 5 to be filled.

Position 1: cannot be S,T,E,B,I (excluded letters), so possible: C,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z but common: C,D,F,G,K,L,M,O,P,U,W

Position 5: similarly, cannot be S,T,E,B,I, and not N (since N at 4, but N can be only once? Not necessarily, but we don't know if duplicate letters. But in feedback, for N, it was only one N in BRAIN, but secret could have multiple. However, we don't have information, so assume no duplicate for now.

Common words with pattern _ R A N _:

- DRANK: D R A N K
- FRANK: F R A N K
- PRANK: P R A N K
- CRANK: C R A N K
- WRANK not word
- GRAND: but that has D at 5, but N at 4? GRAND is G,R,A,N,D so position 4=N, 5=D.

GRAND is possible.

Similarly, BRAND but B out.

So possible: CRANK, DRANK, FRANK, PRANK, GRAND.

GRAND has G at 1, R at 2, A at 3, N at 4, D at 5.

In DRANK, D at 1, K at 5.

Etc.

For the third guess, we can choose one that tests new letters.

For example, ""CRANK"" has C and K.

""PRANK"" has P and K.

""GRAND"" has G and D.

Since we need to find position 1 and 5, we can choose a word that uses common letters.

Also, we might want to test if K is present, or D, etc.

Another idea: since we have limited guesses, we can choose a word that has multiple possibilities.

But we have 4 guesses left, so we can test.

Perhaps ""CRANK"" to test C and K.

But let's see the feedback.

We also have to consider that the word must be valid.

Another common word: ""URBAN"" but position 3 is B, not A.

Not.

""ORGAN"" O R G A N — positions:1=O,2=R,3=G? Not A, position 3 is G, not A.

So not.

So the main candidates are CRANK, DRANK, FRANK, PRANK, GRAND.

Now, from second guess, we have N not at 5, which is satisfied if N at 4.

In GRAND, N is at 4, D at 5.

In DRANK, N at 4, K at 5.

Etc.

For the third guess, I can pick ""FRANK"" for example.

But let's think about what letters we haven't tested.

We have tested: S,T,A,R,E,B,I,N

A and R are in, N is in.

Excluded: S,T,E,B,I

Not tested: C,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Common: C,D,F,G,K,L,M,O,P,U,W

In ""FRANK"": F,R,A,N,K

F and K are new.

Similarly, ""PRANK"": P,R,A,N,K

P and K.

""CRANK"": C,R,A,N,K

C and K.

""GRAND"": G,R,A,N,D

G and D.

""DRANK"": D,R,A,N,K

D and K.

To maximize information, we might want to include a vowel, like O or U.

But in the pattern _ R A N _, position 5 is a consonant in these words.

For example, ""GROAN"" but position 3 not A.

Not possible.

""WRUNG"" not pattern.

So no vowel at position 5 easily.

Position 1 could be a vowel, like U, but ""URBAN"" not.

""ORANT"" not word.

So probably not.

Therefore, I'll go with ""CRANK"" to test C and K.

But C and K are less common than D or G.

""GRAND"" has G and D, which are more common.

G is more common than C or K.

Letter frequencies: E,A,R,I,O,T,N,S,L,C,... so C is common, D is common, G less so.

D is more common than G.

In English, E,A,R,I,O,T,N,S,L,C,U,D,P,M...

D is about 4.3%, P is about 2%, C is 2.7%, K is 0.8%, etc.

But for Wordle, it might vary.

Since we have N at position 4, and we need position 1 and 5.

If I guess ""GRAND"", for example, and if it's not correct, we get feedback on G and D.

Similarly for others.

But we can choose a word that doesn't necessarily have N at 4, to test if N is at position 1.

For example, guess a word with N at position 1: N R A ? ?

But what word? ""NRA something"" — ""NRAIL"" not, ""NRAKE"" not, ""NRAGE"" not, ""DRAIN"" but D R A I N, but I is out, and position 4 I is x, so not.

""TRAIN"" T out.

""GRAIN"" G R A I N, but I out.

So no common word with N at position 1 and A at 3.

Therefore, N must be at position 4.

So pattern is _ R A N _

Now, for the third guess, I'll choose ""DRANK"" to test D and K.

""DRANK"": D R A N K

Positions:1=D,2=R,3=A,4=N,5=K

If D is correct, it will show ✓, similarly for K.

If not, we know.

But we have other options.

Since we have multiple possibilities, we can choose a word that covers more common letters.

Another idea: guess a word that has O or U, but in this pattern, it's hard.

For example, ""CROWN"" not.

""BROWN"" B out.

Not.

So I think ""DRANK"" is fine.

But let's list all possible words to see.

Possible secret words: from Wordle word list, but I don't have it, so common words.

CRANK, DRANK, FRANK, PRANK, GRAND.

Also, ""WRANG"" not.

""TRANS"" T out.

""BRING"" B out, and position 3 I? Not A.

So about 5 possibilities: CRANK, DRANK, FRANK, PRANK, GRAND.

GRAND has D at 5, while others have K at 5 except GRAND.

In GRAND, position 5 is D, in others K.

For the third guess, we can guess one of them to narrow down.

Since we have 4 guesses left, it's ok.

But to be efficient, we can guess a word that tests multiple.

For example, if I guess ""CRANK"", and if it's not correct, we get feedback on C and K.

Similarly.

But let's see what the feedback can tell us.

Perhaps guess a word that is not necessarily possible, but tests letters.

For example, guess ""CROWN"" but position 3 not A.

Not possible because position 3 must be A.

All guesses must have A at position 3 and R at position 2, because we know R is at position 2.

From second guess, R is at position 2, so it must be in the secret word at position 2.

So all future guesses must have R at position 2 and A at position 3.

So pattern: ? R A ? ?

And N is in the word, not at position 5, so at position 1 or 4.

But position 1 and 4 are available.

For the guess, we can have N at position 1 or 4 or not, but we know N is in the word.

In the third guess, we can put N at position 4 to test.

Or at position 1.

But position 1 with N is hard, so put at position 4.

So guess a word with pattern ? R A N ?

Then position 1 and 5 to be guessed.

For example, ""CRANK"" or ""DRANK"" etc.

I think I'll go with ""GRAND"" to test G and D.

""GRAND"": G R A N D

Then if G is correct, position 1 is G, and D at 5.

If not, we know.

Similarly.

But let's choose.

Since K is common in many, perhaps guess ""PRANK"" to test P and K.

But P and K are less common.

""FRANK"" has F, which is less common.

""CRANK"" has C, which is common.

C is more common.

But in ""CRANK"", position 5 is K.

""GRAND"" has G and D, both common.

D is more common than K.

So ""GRAND"" might be better.

Also, ""DRANK"" has D and K, D common, K less.

But ""GRAND"" has G and D.

I think ""GRAND"" is a good choice.

So third guess: ""GRAND""

But let's confirm the pattern: G R A N D

Position 1: G, 2: R, 3: A, 4: N, 5: D

Now, feedback will tell us about G, N, and D.

We know R and A are correct.

N is in the word, but not at position 5, here it is at position 4, so if N is at position 4 in secret, it might be correct or not, but we know N is present.

If position 4 is N in secret, then it will be ✓ for N.

If not, then N is at position 1, and position 4 is something else.

But we'll see.

I think it's fine.

So I'll go with ""GRAND"".
</think>
### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Feedback from Previous Guesses:**
   - **Guess 1: STARE** → Feedback: S(x) T(x) A(✓) R(-) E(x)
     - A is correct and in position 3.
     - R is in the word but not in position 4.
     - S, T, E are absent.
   - **Guess 2: BRAIN** → Feedback: B(x) R(✓) A(✓) I(x) N(-)
     - R is correct and in position 2 (confirming position 2 is R).
     - A is correct and in position 3 (redundant but consistent).
     - N is in the word but not in position 5.
     - B and I are absent.

2. **Key Insights:**
   - **Positions confirmed:**
     - Position 2: R
     - Position 3: A
     - Pattern so far: `_ R A _ _`
   - **Letters present but position unknown:**
     - N is in the word, but not at position 5. Since positions 2 and 3 are fixed, N must be at position 1 or 4.
   - **Absent letters:** S, T, E, B, I (cannot be used).
   - **Possible positions for N:**
     - If N is at position 1, the pattern is `N R A _ _`.
     - If N is at position 4, the pattern is `_ R A N _`.
     - Common English words with `N R A _ _` are rare (e.g., ""NRA"" words are uncommon). Thus, N is more likely at position 4, leading to the pattern `_ R A N _`.
   - **Remaining positions to solve:** Position 1 and position 5.
     - Position 1: Must be a letter not in {S, T, E, B, I}. Common options: C, D, F, G, K, L, M, O, P, U, W.
     - Position 5: Must be a letter not in {S, T, E, B, I, N} (since N is not at position 5). Common options: D, K, L, M, O, P, Y.

3. **Strategy for Third Guess:**
   - Test the pattern `_ R A N _` to verify N at position 4 and gather info on positions 1 and 5.
   - Prioritize common letters for positions 1 and 5 to maximize information (e.g., D, G, K, P).
   - Avoid absent letters (S, T, E, B, I).
   - **Candidate words:** CRANK, DRANK, FRANK, PRANK, GRAND.
     - ""GRAND"" is chosen because:
       - Uses G (position 1) and D (position 5), both common letters not yet tested.
       - If correct, it solves the word. If not, feedback on G and D will narrow possibilities (e.g., if G is absent, position 1 is likely C, F, P, etc.; if D is absent, position 5 is likely K or another letter).
       - Fits the pattern `_ R A N _` directly, testing N at position 4.

<guess>GRAND</guess>",GRAND,"We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: STARE
- S: x (not in word)
- T: x (not in word)
- A: ✓ (correct letter and position, so position 3 is A)
- R: - (in word but wrong position, so R is in the word but not at position 4)
- E: x (not in word)

Second guess: BRAIN
- B: x (not in word)
- R: ✓ (correct letter and position, so position 2 is R)
- A: ✓ (correct letter and position, so position 3 is A, which we already knew)
- I: x (not in word)
- N: - (in word but wrong position, so N is in the word but not at position 5)

Now, combining the information:

1. Position 2 is R (from second guess, R is correct at position 2)
2. Position 3 is A (from first guess, confirmed again)
3. R is in the word, but we now know it is at position 2, so the earlier feedback about R not at position 4 is consistent.
4. N is in the word but not at position 5.
5. S, T, E, B, I are not in the word.

So the secret word has:
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: A
- N is present, but not at position 5.
- No S, T, E, B, I.

The pattern so far: _ R A _ _

We need to find the first, fourth, and fifth letters.

N is in the word but not at position 5, so it must be at position 1 or 4? Positions are 1,2,3,4,5. Position 2 and 3 are taken by R and A, so N can be at position 1 or 4.

But position 4 is available, and position 1 is available.

Also, we need to avoid S, T, E, B, I.

Now, for the third guess, we should try to find a word that fits the pattern _ R A _ _ and includes N in position 1 or 4, and tests other common letters.

Since N is not at position 5, if we put N at position 4, we can test that.

Alternatively, we can put N at position 1 and see.

But we need to cover more letters.

Common letters left: O, U, L, D, C, M, P, etc.

Vowels: O, U (since A is used, and E, I are out).

Consonants: L, N, C, D, M, P, G, K, etc.

Now, the word must have N in it, at position 1 or 4.

Let's consider possibilities.

First, if N is at position 1: then word is N R A _ _

What can the last two be? And must not have S,T,E,B,I.

Examples: ""NRAIL"" not a word.

""NRAPE"" not and E out.

""DRANK"" but D is possible, but position 1 is N, not D.

N R A _ _

""CRANE"" but C and E out.

""GRAND"" but G, and D at 5? N R A ? ?

""BRAND"" but B out.

""PRANK"" P R A N K, but that has R at 2, A at 3, N at 4, K at 5. But if N is at position 4, then for N R A _ _, it would be position 1=N, 2=R, 3=A, 4=?, 5=?

So for example, ""NRAWL"" not word.

""FRAUD"" F R A U D — positions:1=F,2=R,3=A,4=U,5=D — that could be.

""GRAVY"" G R A V Y — 1=G,2=R,3=A,4=V,5=Y.

But N is not in these, but we need N in the word.

If N is at position 1, then ""NRA something"" is hard.

""CRAMP"" but C and P.

Perhaps N at position 4 is more common.

Pattern: _ R A N _

Then position 1 and 5 to fill.

With no S,T,E,B,I.

Common words: ""CRANE"" but E out.

""DRANK"" — D R A N K — positions:1=D,2=R,3=A,4=N,5=K — N at position 4.

""FRANK"" — F R A N K — similar.

""PRANK"" — P R A N K.

""TRANK"" not common.

""WRANG"" not word.

So ""DRANK"", ""FRANK"", ""PRANK"" are candidates.

But we need to avoid B and I, which we are.

In these, N is at position 4, which is consistent with the feedback that N is not at position 5.

Now, position 5 is K in these words.

But we don't know if K is in the word.

For the third guess, we can try one of these to test.

But we also need to test other letters.

Since we have _ R A _ _, and N must be at 1 or 4.

If we try a word with N at position 4, and a new letter at position 1 and 5.

For example, ""CRONY"" but C and O, and position 4 is O? Not N.

""DRONE"" E out.

""GROAN"" — G R O A N? Positions:1=G,2=R,3=O? But position 3 must be A, not O.

Pattern must have A at 3, so _ R A _ _

""GROAN"" is G,R,O,A,N — positions:1=G,2=R,3=O,4=A,5=N — but position 3 is O, not A, so invalid.

So back to _ R A N _ pattern.

Words: DRANK, FRANK, PRANK, WRACK? W R A C K — but C at 4, not N.

WRACK has no N.

So only if we have N at 4.

Other words: ""URBAN"" — U R B A N — positions:1=U,2=R,3=B? Not A, position 3 is B, not A.

""BARON"" but B out, and position 3 O? Not A.

So the common ones are DRANK, FRANK, PRANK.

Also, ""CROWN"" but position 3 O.

Not.

""BRAWN"" B out, and position 3 A? B R A W N — positions:1=B(out),2=R,3=A,4=W,5=N — but B is out, so not possible.

Similarly, ""DRAWN"" — D R A W N — positions:1=D,2=R,3=A,4=W,5=N — this could be, but W and N.

N at position 5? But feedback says N is not at position 5, so in ""DRAWN"", N is at position 5, which is invalid because N cannot be at position 5.

Feedback from BRAIN: N is in word but not at position 5, so N cannot be at position 5.

Therefore, in the secret word, N is not at position 5, so for pattern _ R A _ _, N must be at position 1 or 4.

If at position 4, then word is _ R A N _

If at position 1, then N R A _ _

But N R A _ _ words are rare, like ""NRA something"", but not common English words.

For example, ""NRAKA"" not word.

So probably N is at position 4.

Thus, pattern: _ R A N _

Now, position 1 and 5 to be filled.

Position 1: cannot be S,T,E,B,I (excluded letters), so possible: C,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z but common: C,D,F,G,K,L,M,O,P,U,W

Position 5: similarly, cannot be S,T,E,B,I, and not N (since N at 4, but N can be only once? Not necessarily, but we don't know if duplicate letters. But in feedback, for N, it was only one N in BRAIN, but secret could have multiple. However, we don't have information, so assume no duplicate for now.

Common words with pattern _ R A N _:

- DRANK: D R A N K
- FRANK: F R A N K
- PRANK: P R A N K
- CRANK: C R A N K
- WRANK not word
- GRAND: but that has D at 5, but N at 4? GRAND is G,R,A,N,D so position 4=N, 5=D.

GRAND is possible.

Similarly, BRAND but B out.

So possible: CRANK, DRANK, FRANK, PRANK, GRAND.

GRAND has G at 1, R at 2, A at 3, N at 4, D at 5.

In DRANK, D at 1, K at 5.

Etc.

For the third guess, we can choose one that tests new letters.

For example, ""CRANK"" has C and K.

""PRANK"" has P and K.

""GRAND"" has G and D.

Since we need to find position 1 and 5, we can choose a word that uses common letters.

Also, we might want to test if K is present, or D, etc.

Another idea: since we have limited guesses, we can choose a word that has multiple possibilities.

But we have 4 guesses left, so we can test.

Perhaps ""CRANK"" to test C and K.

But let's see the feedback.

We also have to consider that the word must be valid.

Another common word: ""URBAN"" but position 3 is B, not A.

Not.

""ORGAN"" O R G A N — positions:1=O,2=R,3=G? Not A, position 3 is G, not A.

So not.

So the main candidates are CRANK, DRANK, FRANK, PRANK, GRAND.

Now, from second guess, we have N not at 5, which is satisfied if N at 4.

In GRAND, N is at 4, D at 5.

In DRANK, N at 4, K at 5.

Etc.

For the third guess, I can pick ""FRANK"" for example.

But let's think about what letters we haven't tested.

We have tested: S,T,A,R,E,B,I,N

A and R are in, N is in.

Excluded: S,T,E,B,I

Not tested: C,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Common: C,D,F,G,K,L,M,O,P,U,W

In ""FRANK"": F,R,A,N,K

F and K are new.

Similarly, ""PRANK"": P,R,A,N,K

P and K.

""CRANK"": C,R,A,N,K

C and K.

""GRAND"": G,R,A,N,D

G and D.

""DRANK"": D,R,A,N,K

D and K.

To maximize information, we might want to include a vowel, like O or U.

But in the pattern _ R A N _, position 5 is a consonant in these words.

For example, ""GROAN"" but position 3 not A.

Not possible.

""WRUNG"" not pattern.

So no vowel at position 5 easily.

Position 1 could be a vowel, like U, but ""URBAN"" not.

""ORANT"" not word.

So probably not.

Therefore, I'll go with ""CRANK"" to test C and K.

But C and K are less common than D or G.

""GRAND"" has G and D, which are more common.

G is more common than C or K.

Letter frequencies: E,A,R,I,O,T,N,S,L,C,... so C is common, D is common, G less so.

D is more common than G.

In English, E,A,R,I,O,T,N,S,L,C,U,D,P,M...

D is about 4.3%, P is about 2%, C is 2.7%, K is 0.8%, etc.

But for Wordle, it might vary.

Since we have N at position 4, and we need position 1 and 5.

If I guess ""GRAND"", for example, and if it's not correct, we get feedback on G and D.

Similarly for others.

But we can choose a word that doesn't necessarily have N at 4, to test if N is at position 1.

For example, guess a word with N at position 1: N R A ? ?

But what word? ""NRA something"" — ""NRAIL"" not, ""NRAKE"" not, ""NRAGE"" not, ""DRAIN"" but D R A I N, but I is out, and position 4 I is x, so not.

""TRAIN"" T out.

""GRAIN"" G R A I N, but I out.

So no common word with N at position 1 and A at 3.

Therefore, N must be at position 4.

So pattern is _ R A N _

Now, for the third guess, I'll choose ""DRANK"" to test D and K.

""DRANK"": D R A N K

Positions:1=D,2=R,3=A,4=N,5=K

If D is correct, it will show ✓, similarly for K.

If not, we know.

But we have other options.

Since we have multiple possibilities, we can choose a word that covers more common letters.

Another idea: guess a word that has O or U, but in this pattern, it's hard.

For example, ""CROWN"" not.

""BROWN"" B out.

Not.

So I think ""DRANK"" is fine.

But let's list all possible words to see.

Possible secret words: from Wordle word list, but I don't have it, so common words.

CRANK, DRANK, FRANK, PRANK, GRAND.

Also, ""WRANG"" not.

""TRANS"" T out.

""BRING"" B out, and position 3 I? Not A.

So about 5 possibilities: CRANK, DRANK, FRANK, PRANK, GRAND.

GRAND has D at 5, while others have K at 5 except GRAND.

In GRAND, position 5 is D, in others K.

For the third guess, we can guess one of them to narrow down.

Since we have 4 guesses left, it's ok.

But to be efficient, we can guess a word that tests multiple.

For example, if I guess ""CRANK"", and if it's not correct, we get feedback on C and K.

Similarly.

But let's see what the feedback can tell us.

Perhaps guess a word that is not necessarily possible, but tests letters.

For example, guess ""CROWN"" but position 3 not A.

Not possible because position 3 must be A.

All guesses must have A at position 3 and R at position 2, because we know R is at position 2.

From second guess, R is at position 2, so it must be in the secret word at position 2.

So all future guesses must have R at position 2 and A at position 3.

So pattern: ? R A ? ?

And N is in the word, not at position 5, so at position 1 or 4.

But position 1 and 4 are available.

For the guess, we can have N at position 1 or 4 or not, but we know N is in the word.

In the third guess, we can put N at position 4 to test.

Or at position 1.

But position 1 with N is hard, so put at position 4.

So guess a word with pattern ? R A N ?

Then position 1 and 5 to be guessed.

For example, ""CRANK"" or ""DRANK"" etc.

I think I'll go with ""GRAND"" to test G and D.

""GRAND"": G R A N D

Then if G is correct, position 1 is G, and D at 5.

If not, we know.

Similarly.

But let's choose.

Since K is common in many, perhaps guess ""PRANK"" to test P and K.

But P and K are less common.

""FRANK"" has F, which is less common.

""CRANK"" has C, which is common.

C is more common.

But in ""CRANK"", position 5 is K.

""GRAND"" has G and D, both common.

D is more common than K.

So ""GRAND"" might be better.

Also, ""DRANK"" has D and K, D common, K less.

But ""GRAND"" has G and D.

I think ""GRAND"" is a good choice.

So third guess: ""GRAND""

But let's confirm the pattern: G R A N D

Position 1: G, 2: R, 3: A, 4: N, 5: D

Now, feedback will tell us about G, N, and D.

We know R and A are correct.

N is in the word, but not at position 5, here it is at position 4, so if N is at position 4 in secret, it might be correct or not, but we know N is present.

If position 4 is N in secret, then it will be ✓ for N.

If not, then N is at position 1, and position 4 is something else.

But we'll see.

I think it's fine.

So I'll go with ""GRAND"".### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Feedback from Previous Guesses:**
   - **Guess 1: STARE** → Feedback: S(x) T(x) A(✓) R(-) E(x)
     - A is correct and in position 3.
     - R is in the word but not in position 4.
     - S, T, E are absent.
   - **Guess 2: BRAIN** → Feedback: B(x) R(✓) A(✓) I(x) N(-)
     - R is correct and in position 2 (confirming position 2 is R).
     - A is correct and in position 3 (redundant but consistent).
     - N is in the word but not in position 5.
     - B and I are absent.

2. **Key Insights:**
   - **Positions confirmed:**
     - Position 2: R
     - Position 3: A
     - Pattern so far: `_ R A _ _`
   - **Letters present but position unknown:**
     - N is in the word, but not at position 5. Since positions 2 and 3 are fixed, N must be at position 1 or 4.
   - **Absent letters:** S, T, E, B, I (cannot be used).
   - **Possible positions for N:**
     - If N is at position 1, the pattern is `N R A _ _`.
     - If N is at position 4, the pattern is `_ R A N _`.
     - Common English words with `N R A _ _` are rare (e.g., ""NRA"" words are uncommon). Thus, N is more likely at position 4, leading to the pattern `_ R A N _`.
   - **Remaining positions to solve:** Position 1 and position 5.
     - Position 1: Must be a letter not in {S, T, E, B, I}. Common options: C, D, F, G, K, L, M, O, P, U, W.
     - Position 5: Must be a letter not in {S, T, E, B, I, N} (since N is not at position 5). Common options: D, K, L, M, O, P, Y.

3. **Strategy for Third Guess:**
   - Test the pattern `_ R A N _` to verify N at position 4 and gather info on positions 1 and 5.
   - Prioritize common letters for positions 1 and 5 to maximize information (e.g., D, G, K, P).
   - Avoid absent letters (S, T, E, B, I).
   - **Candidate words:** CRANK, DRANK, FRANK, PRANK, GRAND.
     - ""GRAND"" is chosen because:
       - Uses G (position 1) and D (position 5), both common letters not yet tested.
       - If correct, it solves the word. If not, feedback on G and D will narrow possibilities (e.g., if G is absent, position 1 is likely C, F, P, etc.; if D is absent, position 5 is likely K or another letter).
       - Fits the pattern `_ R A N _` directly, testing N at position 4.",Guess 3: GRAND -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(✓) D(x),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>First, the game is Wordle, where I need to guess a 5-letter secret word with up to 6 tries. For my first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information I get. That means picking a word with common letters to cover as many possibilities as possible.

I recall that in Wordle, common starting words include words with frequent vowels and consonants. Letters like E, A, R, S, T are very common in English words. So, I should choose a word that includes several of these.

Some popular starting words are ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", ""TRACE"", etc. These cover multiple vowels and common consonants.

Let me think about the vowels: A, E, I, O, U are vowels, and I should try to include at least one or two. Consonants like R, S, T, N, L are also frequent.

For example, ""ROAST"" has R, O, A, S, T – that's good because it includes two vowels (O and A) and common consonants.

""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E – R, A, E are common.

""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E.

""SALET"" is another one, but it's less common.

I want a word that is all unique letters to cover more ground. Duplicate letters would give less information.

Let me list possible first guesses: I can start with ""CRANE"".

Why ""CRANE""? It has C, R, A, N, E. C is not as common as S or T, but E, A, R are very frequent. R is a common consonant, E is the most common vowel, A is also common.

Alternatives: ""RAISE"" has R,A,I,S,E – lots of vowels and common consonants.

""IRATE"" – I,R,A,T,E.

But perhaps ""CRANE"" is a solid choice.

Since the feedback will tell me which letters are in the word and their positions, I should try to cover different positions.

But for the first guess, position isn't as critical because I don't have any information.

I think ""CRANE"" is a balanced choice.

Another common one is ""ADIEU"" which has many vowels – A,D,I,E,U. That might be good for vowel coverage, but consonants are important too.

""SLATE"" seems better: S,L,A,T,E – S and T are very common consonants.

S, L, A, T, E – L is common but not as frequent as S or T.

Let me check letter frequencies in English.

According to data, the most common letters in 5-letter words are: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, etc.

Specifically for Wordle, from past games, E, S, A, O, R, I, L, T are top letters.

So, a word with S, E, A, R, T might be ideal.

""STARE"" – S,T,A,R,E – that includes S, T, A, R, E – all highly common letters.

Similarly, ""ROAST"" was R,O,A,S,T – O instead of E.

E is more frequent than O, so ""STARE"" might be slightly better.

""CRANE"" has C and N, which are less common.

I should go with ""STARE"".

But ""SLATE"" is S,L,A,T,E – L is slightly less common than R.

""STARE"" has R, which is good.

Another popular one is ""CRATE"" – C,R,A,T,E – C is less common.

""RAISE"" – R,A,I,S,E – I is common.

To maximize, perhaps ""STARE"" or ""SALET"".

I think ""STARE"" is a good choice for first guess.

But let me confirm: S, T, A, R, E – position-wise, S and E are often at ends, but it's fine.

Since I have to output in the format, I'll go with ""STARE"".

The response format requires me to think step by step, then output the guess.

So for my thought process: I should choose a starting word that includes common letters to gather as much feedback as possible. The letters S, T, A, R, and E are among the most frequent in English words, so ""STARE"" is an effective first guess. It will help identify correct letters and positions, or at least presence/absence, which can guide subsequent guesses.

I think that's reasonable.<thinking>
For the first guess in Wordle, it's best to choose a word that includes a variety of common vowels and consonants to maximize information from the feedback. Common starting words often use letters like E, A, R, S, T, L, which appear frequently in English words. After considering several options like ""CRANE"" (C, R, A, N, E), ""ROAST"" (R, O, A, S, T), and ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E), I selected ""STARE"" as it includes S, T, A, R, E—all highly common letters. This choice covers multiple vowels (A and E) and high-frequency consonants (S, T, R), increasing the likelihood of identifying letters in the secret word. Since the letters are all unique, it avoids redundancy and provides more useful feedback on letter presence and position.
</thinking>

<guess>STARE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(✓) R(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess ""STARE"":
- S: x (not in the word)
- T: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct letter and correct position, so A is the third letter)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position; since position is wrong and it was fourth, R is in the word but not at position 4)
- E: x (not in the word)

From this, we know:
- The secret word contains an 'A' as the third letter.
- It also contains an 'R', but not as the fourth letter (since position is wrong).
- Letters S, T, E are not in the word at all.

We need to make a second guess that is a 5-letter word with:
- 'A' in the third position (because A is confirmed there).
- Must include 'R' somewhere, but not in the fourth position.
- Should not include S, T, E.
- We can include other common letters to test more possibilities.

Given that S, T, E are out, we have to choose from other letters.

We also need to consider that R is in the word but not in position 4. Possible positions for R: since the word has positions 1,2,3,4,5 and we know position 3 is A, so R cannot be at 3. Possible positions: 1,2,4,5? But position 4 is excluded from the feedback? Wait no: the feedback for R is ""-"", meaning present but not at position 4. So R could be at position 1,2, or 5? But we don't know yet.

Positions: 
1: unknown
2: unknown
3: A
4: unknown, but cannot be R? Actually, from feedback, R is not at 4, but it could be at 1,2, or 5.
Position 5 is possible.

Also, S, T, E are absent, so we avoid those.

What common letters can we use? We might want to test other vowels and consonants.

Other vowels: we have O, I, U, Y sometimes, but in this case E is out.

Consonants: common ones like L, N, C, D, etc.

Since we need to place R somewhere, we can try R in position 1 or 2 or 5.

Let me think of words that have ""A"" in the third position.

The pattern is: ? ? A ? ?

And one of the other positions must include R.

Also, no S, T, E.

For example:
- If R is at position 1: R ? A ? ?
- If R is at position 2: ? R A ? ?
- If R is at position 5: ? ? A ? R

Also, we might want to use common letters for the other positions to test.

Common letters not excluded: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But for Wordle, we need likely letters.

Perhaps include O or I, L, N, etc.

Let me brainstorm words:

First, suppose R is at position 1: R ? A ? ?

Possible words: ROUND? But O U N D—position 3 is A, not O. Must be A at 3.

So: R _ A _ _

Examples: RABID (R A B I D — but position 3 is A? R A B I D: position1=R, pos2=A? No, we need pos3 to be A. Here pos2 is A, not pos3.

Word structure: letter1, letter2, A, letter4, letter5.

For R at pos1: R ? A ? ?

Like: RADAR? But R A D A R — but we have A at pos2 and pos4? But we need only pos3 known so far, but in RADAR, A is also at pos2 and pos4? But that could be.

But RADAR would have two As? Not necessarily a problem.

But position 3 is D in RADAR? R-A-D-A-R, so position 3 is D, but we need position 3 to be A? I think I'm confusing.

R A D A R:
Pos1: R, pos2: A, pos3: D, pos4: A, pos5: R.

But we need position 3 to be A, so that won't work.

For R in pos1, the word must have pos3=A, so letter1=R, letter2=?, letter3=A, letter4=?, letter5=?

So examples: REALM? But E is out, we cannot use E.

Also, R is used, but that's fine.

Possible words: 
- RICAN? Not a word.
- RACED? E is out.
- RABID: pos: R, A, B, I, D? But pos2 is A, not pos3. We need pos2 to be something, and pos3=A.

For R at pos1: R letter2 A letter4 letter5.

Letter3 is A, that's fixed.

Words: ROYAL — R O Y A L? But that would be pos1=R, pos2=O, pos3=Y, pos4=A, pos5=L? No, we need pos3=A, not Y.

I think I'm messing up positions.

The word should be: position 1: R (or whatever), position 2: ?, position 3: A, position 4: ?, position 5: ?

So for R at position 1: R (1), ? (2), A (3), ? (4), ? (5)

Words like: ""RAPID"" — R,A,P,I,D — positions: 1:R, 2:A, 3:P? That's not A at3.

Standard: in ""RAPID"", positions: 1=R, 2=A, 3=P, 4=I, 5=D. So position 3 is P, not A.

To have position 3=A, the word must have A as the third letter.

For example: ""CRAWL"" — C,R,A,W,L — positions:1=C,2=R,3=A,4=W,5=L. Here pos3=A.

Similarly, ""BRAWL"" — B,R,A,W,L — same pattern? B R A W L: 1=B,2=R,3=A,4=W,5=L.

But R is in the word, and in this case at position 2.

Back to R at position 1.

What word has first letter R and third letter A: so pattern R ? A ? ?

Examples: ""RADIO"" — R,A,D,I,O — but positions:1=R,2=A,3=D — again pos3 is D, not A.

I need words where the third letter is A.

""MANIA"" is M,A,N,I,A — pos3=N? Not A.

Actually, common words: like ""PLANT"" but P,L,A,N,T — here A is position 3.

PLANT: letters P,L,A,N,T — pos1=P,2=L,3=A,4=N,5=T.

Similarly, ""GRANT"" — G,R,A,N,T — 1=G,2=R,3=A,4=N,5=T.

In ""GRANT"", we have R at position 2.

For R at position 1, what about ""RAVEN""? But E is out.

""RALPH"" not common.

Perhaps ""RAMIN""? Not English.

""OASIS"" but O,A,S,I,S — pos3=S? No.

List words with A as third letter.

From memory: BLAND, BRAND, CRAMP, etc.

But for R at position 1: ""RARER""? R,A,R,E,R — but E is out, and A is position 2.

""RAPER"" has E.

""RAZER"" not word.

It's hard to find with R at 1 and A at 3.

""RAYON"" — R,A,Y,O,N? Positions:1=R,2=A,3=Y — not A.

Perhaps I should look for words where R is in another position.

Since R is not at position 4, and position 3 is A, R could be at 1,2, or 5.

Position 4 is unknown, but cannot be R because R is not at 4 based on feedback? Feedback for position 4 of STARE was R but wrong position, so R is not at position 4 for the secret word.

Similarly, position 1 cannot be S, position 2 cannot be T? No, feedback says S was at position 1 of guess and x, meaning no S at all. Similarly T at position 2 of guess and x, meaning T not in word. E not in word.

So secret word: no S, T, E, and has A at position 3, R somewhere not at position 4.

Possible positions for R: 1,2,5.

Since position 4 cannot be R, and position 3 is A, so R at 1,2,5.

Now for second guess, we want to test R in a specific position as well as introduce new letters.

Also, since we have limited tries, we should cover more common letters.

Let's consider positions.

Case 1: R at position 1.
Then word: R ? A ? ? 

What words? Like ""RIVAL"" — R,I,V,A,L — but position 3 is V, not A. 
""ROYAL"" — R,O,Y,A,L — positions:1=R,2=O,3=Y?! No.

""RUMBA""? R,U,M,B,A — positions:1=R,2=U,3=M,4=B,5=A — position 5 is A, not 3.

I think I give up on R at 1 for now; it's rare.

Case 2: R at position 2.
Then word: ? R A ? ?

Examples: CRANE — but C,R,A,N,E — E is out.
PLANE — P,L,A,N,E — E out.
GRAPE — G,R,A,P,E — E out.
BRAVE — B,R,A,V,E — E out.
DRAKE — D,R,A,K,E — E out.

All end with E issue.

""CRACK"" — C,R,A,C,K — but C and K, and double C? Not good.

""DRAMA"" — D,R,A,M,A — positions:1=D,2=R,3=A,4=M,5=A — possible, but A at pos5 too? We don't know.

""BRAND"" — B,R,A,N,D — positions:1=B,2=R,3=A,4=N,5=D — good.

""A"" at position 3, R at position 2.

Similarly, ""GRAND"" — G,R,A,N,D.

""PRANK"" — P,R,A,N,K.

So possible words: BRAND, GRAND, PRANK, etc.

But S,T,E absent, so ""BRAND"" has B,R,A,N,D.

Case 3: R at position 5.
Then word: ? ? A ? R

Examples: ""SUGAR"" but S out, E not used but S out.
""NOVAR"" not word.
""LUNAR"" — L,U,N,A,R? Positions:1=L,2=U,3=N? Not A.
We need position 3=A.

So for R at 5: ? ? A ? R

""POLAR"" — P,O,L,A,R — positions:1=P,2=O,3=L,4=A,5=R — position 3 is L, not A.

""RADAR"" but R at 1 and 5, position 3=D.

""SONAR"" — S O N A R? Position:1=S(out),2=O,3=N,4=A,5=R — position 3 is N, not A.

""MANOR"" — M A N O R — pos1=M,2=A,3=N,4=O,5=R — position 3=N, not A.

It's hard with R at 5 and A at 3.

""VIXEN"" but E out.

Perhaps ""MACAW"" but not with R.

Common word: think of ""OVARY"" — O V A R Y? Positions:1=O,2=V,3=A,4=R,5=Y — but that has R at position 4, but our feedback says R not at position 4? So cannot be, because we have R not at pos4.

Similarly, ""CARRY"" has C,A,R,R,Y but double R and position 3=R? Different.

Sticking with R at position 2 seems easier.

So for the guess, we can assume R at position 2, and try ""BRAND"" for example.

But we don't know for sure, so we should keep options open.

The second guess should help us narrow down.

Current constraints:
- Letter 3: A
- R is in the word, not at position 4.
- S, T, E absent.
- Possible R positions: 1,2,5

I should try a word that has R in position 1 or 2 or 5, and also test other common letters.

Since position 4 cannot be R, we can test letter for position 4.

Also, we should avoid unused letters if possible, but include common ones.

Common letters not used yet: I, O, U, L, N, C, D, M, etc.

For instance, include O, or I or L, N, etc.

Let's list candidate words for second guess.

Possible words with A at pos 3, and R somewhere not 4.

Examples:
- If R at pos 2: ""BRAND"" (B,R,A,N,D)
- ""GRAND"" (G,R,A,N,D)
- ""PRANK"" (P,R,A,N,K)
- ""CRANK"" (C,R,A,N,K) — but C and K
- ""DRAIN"" (D,R,A,I,N) — I is vowel, good

If R at pos 1: hard to find; ""RABIC"" not word; ""RAPID"" not A at 3 as above.

""MAJAR"" not word.

Assume R at pos 2 for common words.

If R at pos 5: ""TONER"" but T out, E out.
""COVER"" E out.
""MINOR"" R at 5, but position 3 N? Not A.

""SUPER"" S out.

Not easy.

So probably R is at position 2 in many cases.

For second guess, I can choose ""BRAND"" to test B, R, N, D.

R is at position 2, which might be correct or not.

But also, ""DRAIN"" has I which is a common vowel.

""DRAIN"": D,R,A,I,N — positions:1=D,2=R,3=A,4=I,5=N

Here R at position 2.

Similarly, ""BRAVO"" — B,R,A,V,O — but O is vowel.

V is less common.

Let's evaluate letters. From the first guess, we know A and R are in, so we can focus on finding their positions.

Specifically, we need to find where R is.

Since it's not at 4, and 3 is A, R must be at 1,2, or 5.

To test this, I can guess a word with R at one of these positions.

For example, if I guess a word with R at position 1, and if it gets a check or minus, I'll know.

Similarly for other positions.

But since we have A fixed at position 3, it might restrict the word.

Another idea: guess a word that has R at position 2, as in ""CRANE"" but E out.

""ORCIN"" not word.

Chose ""GRAPH"" — G,R,A,P,H — position 1=G,2=R,3=A,4=P,5=H — P and H are uncommon, but possible.

But P and H are less common; better to use common letters.

""BRAIN"" — B,R,A,I,N — this is good: B,R,A,I,N

Positions:1=B,2=R,3=A,4=I,5=N

In this guess, position 4 is I, which we can test.

Also, B, I, N are new letters.

Similarly, ""FLAIR"" but L,A,I,R — positions:1=F,2=L,3=A,4=I,5=R — but R at position 5 here, which is an option.

In ""FLAIR"", we have L and F.

But let's compare to ""BRAIN"".

I think ""BRAIN"" is a good choice: it has R at position 2 (which might be correct), A at position 3 fixed, and uses B, I, N – common letters.

If R is not at position 2, say if R is at position 1 or 5, then in this guess, 4=I,5=N, so if R is at 5, position 4 could be something else.

But we'll get feedback.

Feedback would tell if B, I, N are present, and position of R.

The word must not have E,S,T, and has A at 3, R somewhere.

So guess ""BRAIN"".

""TRAIN"" has T, which is out.

No, T is absent.

So ""BRAIN"" (B,R,A,I,N) is valid.

Other options: ""DRAIN"" (D,R,A,I,N), similar.

""GRAIN"" (G,R,A,I,N).

Any of these is fine.

I think I'll go with ""BRAIN"".

To vary letters, since in STARE we had S,T,A,R,E, now B,I,N are new.

N is common.

So my second guess: ""BRAIN"".

But let's confirm the pattern: for ""BRAIN"", position 1=B, 2=R, 3=A, 4=I, 5=N.

A at pos 3 fixed.

R at pos 2.

If the secret word has R at pos 1, for example, then in ""BRAIN"", R is at pos 2, which would show as ""-"" if R is present but not at pos 2? Feedback will show R as ""-"" for wrong position only if R is elsewhere.

But we already know R is in the word, so if we guess R at pos 2, and it's not there, it will show ""-"" and we know it's not at 2.

Similarly, if we guess a word with R at pos 1, but with A at 3.

For example, ""CRAMP"" — C,R,A,M,P — but C at 1, R at 2? No, C,R,A,M,P.

Position:1=C,2=R,3=A,4=M,5=P.

R at pos 2.

Or ""WRACK"" — W,R,A,C,K — same.

No word with R at 1 and A at 3 easily.

So I'll use ""BRAIN"" as second guess.<thinking>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""STARE"":  
- S: not in the secret word (x)  
- T: not in the secret word (x)  
- A: correct letter and position (✓), so A is the third letter.  
- R: in the secret word but wrong position (-), so R is present but not at position 4.  
- E: not in the secret word (x)  

Key insights:  
1. The secret word has A as the third letter (pattern: _ _ A _ _).  
2. R is in the word but not in position 4—possible positions are 1, 2, or 5.  
3. S, T, and E are absent—must avoid these letters.  

For the second guess:  
- Prioritize testing the position of R (likely in positions 1, 2, or 5) while keeping A fixed at position 3.  
- Include new common vowels/consonants not yet tested: focus on letters like B, I, N, L, O, etc.  
- Aim for a valid word that fits: ? ? A ? ?  

Good candidates:  
- ""BRAIN"": B R A I N  
  - Positions: B(1), R(2), A(3), I(4), N(5)  
  - Tests R at position 2, which might be correct. Introduces B, I, N—common letters.  
- ""BRAND"": B R A N D  
  - Similar, but N at position 4 and D at 5 (less vowel coverage).  
- ""DRAIN"": D R A I N  
  - Less common starting letter D.  

""BRAIN"" is selected because:  
- It tests R at position 2 (a common spot).  
- Provides information on B (new consonant), I (new vowel), and N (new consonant).  
- Fits all constraints (no S/T/E, A at position 3).

<guess>BRAIN</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(✓) R(-) E(x)
Guess 2: BRAIN -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) A(✓) I(x) N(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: STARE
- S: x (not in word)
- T: x (not in word)
- A: ✓ (correct letter and position, so position 3 is A)
- R: - (in word but wrong position, so R is in the word but not at position 4)
- E: x (not in word)

Second guess: BRAIN
- B: x (not in word)
- R: ✓ (correct letter and position, so position 2 is R)
- A: ✓ (correct letter and position, so position 3 is A, which we already knew)
- I: x (not in word)
- N: - (in word but wrong position, so N is in the word but not at position 5)

Now, combining the information:

1. Position 2 is R (from second guess, R is correct at position 2)
2. Position 3 is A (from first guess, confirmed again)
3. R is in the word, but we now know it is at position 2, so the earlier feedback about R not at position 4 is consistent.
4. N is in the word but not at position 5.
5. S, T, E, B, I are not in the word.

So the secret word has:
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: A
- N is present, but not at position 5.
- No S, T, E, B, I.

The pattern so far: _ R A _ _

We need to find the first, fourth, and fifth letters.

N is in the word but not at position 5, so it must be at position 1 or 4? Positions are 1,2,3,4,5. Position 2 and 3 are taken by R and A, so N can be at position 1 or 4.

But position 4 is available, and position 1 is available.

Also, we need to avoid S, T, E, B, I.

Now, for the third guess, we should try to find a word that fits the pattern _ R A _ _ and includes N in position 1 or 4, and tests other common letters.

Since N is not at position 5, if we put N at position 4, we can test that.

Alternatively, we can put N at position 1 and see.

But we need to cover more letters.

Common letters left: O, U, L, D, C, M, P, etc.

Vowels: O, U (since A is used, and E, I are out).

Consonants: L, N, C, D, M, P, G, K, etc.

Now, the word must have N in it, at position 1 or 4.

Let's consider possibilities.

First, if N is at position 1: then word is N R A _ _

What can the last two be? And must not have S,T,E,B,I.

Examples: ""NRAIL"" not a word.

""NRAPE"" not and E out.

""DRANK"" but D is possible, but position 1 is N, not D.

N R A _ _

""CRANE"" but C and E out.

""GRAND"" but G, and D at 5? N R A ? ?

""BRAND"" but B out.

""PRANK"" P R A N K, but that has R at 2, A at 3, N at 4, K at 5. But if N is at position 4, then for N R A _ _, it would be position 1=N, 2=R, 3=A, 4=?, 5=?

So for example, ""NRAWL"" not word.

""FRAUD"" F R A U D — positions:1=F,2=R,3=A,4=U,5=D — that could be.

""GRAVY"" G R A V Y — 1=G,2=R,3=A,4=V,5=Y.

But N is not in these, but we need N in the word.

If N is at position 1, then ""NRA something"" is hard.

""CRAMP"" but C and P.

Perhaps N at position 4 is more common.

Pattern: _ R A N _

Then position 1 and 5 to fill.

With no S,T,E,B,I.

Common words: ""CRANE"" but E out.

""DRANK"" — D R A N K — positions:1=D,2=R,3=A,4=N,5=K — N at position 4.

""FRANK"" — F R A N K — similar.

""PRANK"" — P R A N K.

""TRANK"" not common.

""WRANG"" not word.

So ""DRANK"", ""FRANK"", ""PRANK"" are candidates.

But we need to avoid B and I, which we are.

In these, N is at position 4, which is consistent with the feedback that N is not at position 5.

Now, position 5 is K in these words.

But we don't know if K is in the word.

For the third guess, we can try one of these to test.

But we also need to test other letters.

Since we have _ R A _ _, and N must be at 1 or 4.

If we try a word with N at position 4, and a new letter at position 1 and 5.

For example, ""CRONY"" but C and O, and position 4 is O? Not N.

""DRONE"" E out.

""GROAN"" — G R O A N? Positions:1=G,2=R,3=O? But position 3 must be A, not O.

Pattern must have A at 3, so _ R A _ _

""GROAN"" is G,R,O,A,N — positions:1=G,2=R,3=O,4=A,5=N — but position 3 is O, not A, so invalid.

So back to _ R A N _ pattern.

Words: DRANK, FRANK, PRANK, WRACK? W R A C K — but C at 4, not N.

WRACK has no N.

So only if we have N at 4.

Other words: ""URBAN"" — U R B A N — positions:1=U,2=R,3=B? Not A, position 3 is B, not A.

""BARON"" but B out, and position 3 O? Not A.

So the common ones are DRANK, FRANK, PRANK.

Also, ""CROWN"" but position 3 O.

Not.

""BRAWN"" B out, and position 3 A? B R A W N — positions:1=B(out),2=R,3=A,4=W,5=N — but B is out, so not possible.

Similarly, ""DRAWN"" — D R A W N — positions:1=D,2=R,3=A,4=W,5=N — this could be, but W and N.

N at position 5? But feedback says N is not at position 5, so in ""DRAWN"", N is at position 5, which is invalid because N cannot be at position 5.

Feedback from BRAIN: N is in word but not at position 5, so N cannot be at position 5.

Therefore, in the secret word, N is not at position 5, so for pattern _ R A _ _, N must be at position 1 or 4.

If at position 4, then word is _ R A N _

If at position 1, then N R A _ _

But N R A _ _ words are rare, like ""NRA something"", but not common English words.

For example, ""NRAKA"" not word.

So probably N is at position 4.

Thus, pattern: _ R A N _

Now, position 1 and 5 to be filled.

Position 1: cannot be S,T,E,B,I (excluded letters), so possible: C,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z but common: C,D,F,G,K,L,M,O,P,U,W

Position 5: similarly, cannot be S,T,E,B,I, and not N (since N at 4, but N can be only once? Not necessarily, but we don't know if duplicate letters. But in feedback, for N, it was only one N in BRAIN, but secret could have multiple. However, we don't have information, so assume no duplicate for now.

Common words with pattern _ R A N _:

- DRANK: D R A N K
- FRANK: F R A N K
- PRANK: P R A N K
- CRANK: C R A N K
- WRANK not word
- GRAND: but that has D at 5, but N at 4? GRAND is G,R,A,N,D so position 4=N, 5=D.

GRAND is possible.

Similarly, BRAND but B out.

So possible: CRANK, DRANK, FRANK, PRANK, GRAND.

GRAND has G at 1, R at 2, A at 3, N at 4, D at 5.

In DRANK, D at 1, K at 5.

Etc.

For the third guess, we can choose one that tests new letters.

For example, ""CRANK"" has C and K.

""PRANK"" has P and K.

""GRAND"" has G and D.

Since we need to find position 1 and 5, we can choose a word that uses common letters.

Also, we might want to test if K is present, or D, etc.

Another idea: since we have limited guesses, we can choose a word that has multiple possibilities.

But we have 4 guesses left, so we can test.

Perhaps ""CRANK"" to test C and K.

But let's see the feedback.

We also have to consider that the word must be valid.

Another common word: ""URBAN"" but position 3 is B, not A.

Not.

""ORGAN"" O R G A N — positions:1=O,2=R,3=G? Not A, position 3 is G, not A.

So not.

So the main candidates are CRANK, DRANK, FRANK, PRANK, GRAND.

Now, from second guess, we have N not at 5, which is satisfied if N at 4.

In GRAND, N is at 4, D at 5.

In DRANK, N at 4, K at 5.

Etc.

For the third guess, I can pick ""FRANK"" for example.

But let's think about what letters we haven't tested.

We have tested: S,T,A,R,E,B,I,N

A and R are in, N is in.

Excluded: S,T,E,B,I

Not tested: C,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Common: C,D,F,G,K,L,M,O,P,U,W

In ""FRANK"": F,R,A,N,K

F and K are new.

Similarly, ""PRANK"": P,R,A,N,K

P and K.

""CRANK"": C,R,A,N,K

C and K.

""GRAND"": G,R,A,N,D

G and D.

""DRANK"": D,R,A,N,K

D and K.

To maximize information, we might want to include a vowel, like O or U.

But in the pattern _ R A N _, position 5 is a consonant in these words.

For example, ""GROAN"" but position 3 not A.

Not possible.

""WRUNG"" not pattern.

So no vowel at position 5 easily.

Position 1 could be a vowel, like U, but ""URBAN"" not.

""ORANT"" not word.

So probably not.

Therefore, I'll go with ""CRANK"" to test C and K.

But C and K are less common than D or G.

""GRAND"" has G and D, which are more common.

G is more common than C or K.

Letter frequencies: E,A,R,I,O,T,N,S,L,C,... so C is common, D is common, G less so.

D is more common than G.

In English, E,A,R,I,O,T,N,S,L,C,U,D,P,M...

D is about 4.3%, P is about 2%, C is 2.7%, K is 0.8%, etc.

But for Wordle, it might vary.

Since we have N at position 4, and we need position 1 and 5.

If I guess ""GRAND"", for example, and if it's not correct, we get feedback on G and D.

Similarly for others.

But we can choose a word that doesn't necessarily have N at 4, to test if N is at position 1.

For example, guess a word with N at position 1: N R A ? ?

But what word? ""NRA something"" — ""NRAIL"" not, ""NRAKE"" not, ""NRAGE"" not, ""DRAIN"" but D R A I N, but I is out, and position 4 I is x, so not.

""TRAIN"" T out.

""GRAIN"" G R A I N, but I out.

So no common word with N at position 1 and A at 3.

Therefore, N must be at position 4.

So pattern is _ R A N _

Now, for the third guess, I'll choose ""DRANK"" to test D and K.

""DRANK"": D R A N K

Positions:1=D,2=R,3=A,4=N,5=K

If D is correct, it will show ✓, similarly for K.

If not, we know.

But we have other options.

Since we have multiple possibilities, we can choose a word that covers more common letters.

Another idea: guess a word that has O or U, but in this pattern, it's hard.

For example, ""CROWN"" not.

""BROWN"" B out.

Not.

So I think ""DRANK"" is fine.

But let's list all possible words to see.

Possible secret words: from Wordle word list, but I don't have it, so common words.

CRANK, DRANK, FRANK, PRANK, GRAND.

Also, ""WRANG"" not.

""TRANS"" T out.

""BRING"" B out, and position 3 I? Not A.

So about 5 possibilities: CRANK, DRANK, FRANK, PRANK, GRAND.

GRAND has D at 5, while others have K at 5 except GRAND.

In GRAND, position 5 is D, in others K.

For the third guess, we can guess one of them to narrow down.

Since we have 4 guesses left, it's ok.

But to be efficient, we can guess a word that tests multiple.

For example, if I guess ""CRANK"", and if it's not correct, we get feedback on C and K.

Similarly.

But let's see what the feedback can tell us.

Perhaps guess a word that is not necessarily possible, but tests letters.

For example, guess ""CROWN"" but position 3 not A.

Not possible because position 3 must be A.

All guesses must have A at position 3 and R at position 2, because we know R is at position 2.

From second guess, R is at position 2, so it must be in the secret word at position 2.

So all future guesses must have R at position 2 and A at position 3.

So pattern: ? R A ? ?

And N is in the word, not at position 5, so at position 1 or 4.

But position 1 and 4 are available.

For the guess, we can have N at position 1 or 4 or not, but we know N is in the word.

In the third guess, we can put N at position 4 to test.

Or at position 1.

But position 1 with N is hard, so put at position 4.

So guess a word with pattern ? R A N ?

Then position 1 and 5 to be guessed.

For example, ""CRANK"" or ""DRANK"" etc.

I think I'll go with ""GRAND"" to test G and D.

""GRAND"": G R A N D

Then if G is correct, position 1 is G, and D at 5.

If not, we know.

Similarly.

But let's choose.

Since K is common in many, perhaps guess ""PRANK"" to test P and K.

But P and K are less common.

""FRANK"" has F, which is less common.

""CRANK"" has C, which is common.

C is more common.

But in ""CRANK"", position 5 is K.

""GRAND"" has G and D, both common.

D is more common than K.

So ""GRAND"" might be better.

Also, ""DRANK"" has D and K, D common, K less.

But ""GRAND"" has G and D.

I think ""GRAND"" is a good choice.

So third guess: ""GRAND""

But let's confirm the pattern: G R A N D

Position 1: G, 2: R, 3: A, 4: N, 5: D

Now, feedback will tell us about G, N, and D.

We know R and A are correct.

N is in the word, but not at position 5, here it is at position 4, so if N is at position 4 in secret, it might be correct or not, but we know N is present.

If position 4 is N in secret, then it will be ✓ for N.

If not, then N is at position 1, and position 4 is something else.

But we'll see.

I think it's fine.

So I'll go with ""GRAND"".### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Feedback from Previous Guesses:**
   - **Guess 1: STARE** → Feedback: S(x) T(x) A(✓) R(-) E(x)
     - A is correct and in position 3.
     - R is in the word but not in position 4.
     - S, T, E are absent.
   - **Guess 2: BRAIN** → Feedback: B(x) R(✓) A(✓) I(x) N(-)
     - R is correct and in position 2 (confirming position 2 is R).
     - A is correct and in position 3 (redundant but consistent).
     - N is in the word but not in position 5.
     - B and I are absent.

2. **Key Insights:**
   - **Positions confirmed:**
     - Position 2: R
     - Position 3: A
     - Pattern so far: `_ R A _ _`
   - **Letters present but position unknown:**
     - N is in the word, but not at position 5. Since positions 2 and 3 are fixed, N must be at position 1 or 4.
   - **Absent letters:** S, T, E, B, I (cannot be used).
   - **Possible positions for N:**
     - If N is at position 1, the pattern is `N R A _ _`.
     - If N is at position 4, the pattern is `_ R A N _`.
     - Common English words with `N R A _ _` are rare (e.g., ""NRA"" words are uncommon). Thus, N is more likely at position 4, leading to the pattern `_ R A N _`.
   - **Remaining positions to solve:** Position 1 and position 5.
     - Position 1: Must be a letter not in {S, T, E, B, I}. Common options: C, D, F, G, K, L, M, O, P, U, W.
     - Position 5: Must be a letter not in {S, T, E, B, I, N} (since N is not at position 5). Common options: D, K, L, M, O, P, Y.

3. **Strategy for Third Guess:**
   - Test the pattern `_ R A N _` to verify N at position 4 and gather info on positions 1 and 5.
   - Prioritize common letters for positions 1 and 5 to maximize information (e.g., D, G, K, P).
   - Avoid absent letters (S, T, E, B, I).
   - **Candidate words:** CRANK, DRANK, FRANK, PRANK, GRAND.
     - ""GRAND"" is chosen because:
       - Uses G (position 1) and D (position 5), both common letters not yet tested.
       - If correct, it solves the word. If not, feedback on G and D will narrow possibilities (e.g., if G is absent, position 1 is likely C, F, P, etc.; if D is absent, position 5 is likely K or another letter).
       - Fits the pattern `_ R A N _` directly, testing N at position 4.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information I get. That means picking a word with common letters to cover as many possibilities as possible.\n\nI recall that in Wordle, common starting words include words with frequent vowels and consonants. Letters like E, A, R, S, T are very common in English words. So, I should choose a word that includes several of these.\n\nSome popular starting words are ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", ""TRACE"", etc. These cover multiple vowels and common consonants.\n\nLet me think about the vowels: A, E, I, O, U are vowels, and I should try to include at least one or two. Consonants like R, S, T, N, L are also frequent.\n\nFor example, ""ROAST"" has R, O, A, S, T – that\'s good because it includes two vowels (O and A) and common consonants.\n\n""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E – R, A, E are common.\n\n""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E.\n\n""SALET"" is another one, but it\'s less common.\n\nI want a word that is all unique letters to cover more ground. Duplicate letters would give less information.\n\nLet me list possible first guesses: I can start with ""CRANE"".\n\nWhy ""CRANE""? It has C, R, A, N, E. C is not as common as S or T, but E, A, R are very frequent. R is a common consonant, E is the most common vowel, A is also common.\n\nAlternatives: ""RAISE"" has R,A,I,S,E – lots of vowels and common consonants.\n\n""IRATE"" – I,R,A,T,E.\n\nBut perhaps ""CRANE"" is a solid choice.\n\nSince the feedback will tell me which letters are in the word and their positions, I should try to cover different positions.\n\nBut for the first guess, position isn\'t as critical because I don\'t have any information.\n\nI think ""CRANE"" is a balanced choice.\n\nAnother common one is ""ADIEU"" which has many vowels – A,D,I,E,U. That might be good for vowel coverage, but consonants are important too.\n\n""SLATE"" seems better: S,L,A,T,E – S and T are very common consonants.\n\nS, L, A, T, E – L is common but not as frequent as S or T.\n\nLet me check letter frequencies in English.\n\nAccording to data, the most common letters in 5-letter words are: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, etc.\n\nSpecifically for Wordle, from past games, E, S, A, O, R, I, L, T are top letters.\n\nSo, a word with S, E, A, R, T might be ideal.\n\n""STARE"" – S,T,A,R,E – that includes S, T, A, R, E – all highly common letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""ROAST"" was R,O,A,S,T – O instead of E.\n\nE is more frequent than O, so ""STARE"" might be slightly better.\n\n""CRANE"" has C and N, which are less common.\n\nI should go with ""STARE"".\n\nBut ""SLATE"" is S,L,A,T,E – L is slightly less common than R.\n\n""STARE"" has R, which is good.\n\nAnother popular one is ""CRATE"" – C,R,A,T,E – C is less common.\n\n""RAISE"" – R,A,I,S,E – I is common.\n\nTo maximize, perhaps ""STARE"" or ""SALET"".\n\nI think ""STARE"" is a good choice for first guess.\n\nBut let me confirm: S, T, A, R, E – position-wise, S and E are often at ends, but it\'s fine.\n\nSince I have to output in the format, I\'ll go with ""STARE"".\n\nThe response format requires me to think step by step, then output the guess.\n\nSo for my thought process: I should choose a starting word that includes common letters to gather as much feedback as possible. The letters S, T, A, R, and E are among the most frequent in English words, so ""STARE"" is an effective first guess. It will help identify correct letters and positions, or at least presence/absence, which can guide subsequent guesses.\n\nI think that\'s reasonable.<thinking>\nFor the first guess in Wordle, it\'s best to choose a word that includes a variety of common vowels and consonants to maximize information from the feedback. Common starting words often use letters like E, A, R, S, T, L, which appear frequently in English words. After considering several options like ""CRANE"" (C, R, A, N, E), ""ROAST"" (R, O, A, S, T), and ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E), I selected ""STARE"" as it includes S, T, A, R, E—all highly common letters. This choice covers multiple vowels (A and E) and high-frequency consonants (S, T, R), increasing the likelihood of identifying letters in the secret word. Since the letters are all unique, it avoids redundancy and provides more useful feedback on letter presence and position.\n</thinking>\n\n<guess>STARE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(✓) R(-) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from the first guess ""STARE"":\n- S: x (not in the word)\n- T: x (not in the word)\n- A: ✓ (correct letter and correct position, so A is the third letter)\n- R: - (in the word but wrong position; since position is wrong and it was fourth, R is in the word but not at position 4)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nFrom this, we know:\n- The secret word contains an \'A\' as the third letter.\n- It also contains an \'R\', but not as the fourth letter (since position is wrong).\n- Letters S, T, E are not in the word at all.\n\nWe need to make a second guess that is a 5-letter word with:\n- \'A\' in the third position (because A is confirmed there).\n- Must include \'R\' somewhere, but not in the fourth position.\n- Should not include S, T, E.\n- We can include other common letters to test more possibilities.\n\nGiven that S, T, E are out, we have to choose from other letters.\n\nWe also need to consider that R is in the word but not in position 4. Possible positions for R: since the word has positions 1,2,3,4,5 and we know position 3 is A, so R cannot be at 3. Possible positions: 1,2,4,5? But position 4 is excluded from the feedback? Wait no: the feedback for R is ""-"", meaning present but not at position 4. So R could be at position 1,2, or 5? But we don\'t know yet.\n\nPositions: \n1: unknown\n2: unknown\n3: A\n4: unknown, but cannot be R? Actually, from feedback, R is not at 4, but it could be at 1,2, or 5.\nPosition 5 is possible.\n\nAlso, S, T, E are absent, so we avoid those.\n\nWhat common letters can we use? We might want to test other vowels and consonants.\n\nOther vowels: we have O, I, U, Y sometimes, but in this case E is out.\n\nConsonants: common ones like L, N, C, D, etc.\n\nSince we need to place R somewhere, we can try R in position 1 or 2 or 5.\n\nLet me think of words that have ""A"" in the third position.\n\nThe pattern is: ? ? A ? ?\n\nAnd one of the other positions must include R.\n\nAlso, no S, T, E.\n\nFor example:\n- If R is at position 1: R ? A ? ?\n- If R is at position 2: ? R A ? ?\n- If R is at position 5: ? ? A ? R\n\nAlso, we might want to use common letters for the other positions to test.\n\nCommon letters not excluded: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But for Wordle, we need likely letters.\n\nPerhaps include O or I, L, N, etc.\n\nLet me brainstorm words:\n\nFirst, suppose R is at position 1: R ? A ? ?\n\nPossible words: ROUND? But O U N D—position 3 is A, not O. Must be A at 3.\n\nSo: R _ A _ _\n\nExamples: RABID (R A B I D — but position 3 is A? R A B I D: position1=R, pos2=A? No, we need pos3 to be A. Here pos2 is A, not pos3.\n\nWord structure: letter1, letter2, A, letter4, letter5.\n\nFor R at pos1: R ? A ? ?\n\nLike: RADAR? But R A D A R — but we have A at pos2 and pos4? But we need only pos3 known so far, but in RADAR, A is also at pos2 and pos4? But that could be.\n\nBut RADAR would have two As? Not necessarily a problem.\n\nBut position 3 is D in RADAR? R-A-D-A-R, so position 3 is D, but we need position 3 to be A? I think I\'m confusing.\n\nR A D A R:\nPos1: R, pos2: A, pos3: D, pos4: A, pos5: R.\n\nBut we need position 3 to be A, so that won\'t work.\n\nFor R in pos1, the word must have pos3=A, so letter1=R, letter2=?, letter3=A, letter4=?, letter5=?\n\nSo examples: REALM? But E is out, we cannot use E.\n\nAlso, R is used, but that\'s fine.\n\nPossible words: \n- RICAN? Not a word.\n- RACED? E is out.\n- RABID: pos: R, A, B, I, D? But pos2 is A, not pos3. We need pos2 to be something, and pos3=A.\n\nFor R at pos1: R letter2 A letter4 letter5.\n\nLetter3 is A, that\'s fixed.\n\nWords: ROYAL — R O Y A L? But that would be pos1=R, pos2=O, pos3=Y, pos4=A, pos5=L? No, we need pos3=A, not Y.\n\nI think I\'m messing up positions.\n\nThe word should be: position 1: R (or whatever), position 2: ?, position 3: A, position 4: ?, position 5: ?\n\nSo for R at position 1: R (1), ? (2), A (3), ? (4), ? (5)\n\nWords like: ""RAPID"" — R,A,P,I,D — positions: 1:R, 2:A, 3:P? That\'s not A at3.\n\nStandard: in ""RAPID"", positions: 1=R, 2=A, 3=P, 4=I, 5=D. So position 3 is P, not A.\n\nTo have position 3=A, the word must have A as the third letter.\n\nFor example: ""CRAWL"" — C,R,A,W,L — positions:1=C,2=R,3=A,4=W,5=L. Here pos3=A.\n\nSimilarly, ""BRAWL"" — B,R,A,W,L — same pattern? B R A W L: 1=B,2=R,3=A,4=W,5=L.\n\nBut R is in the word, and in this case at position 2.\n\nBack to R at position 1.\n\nWhat word has first letter R and third letter A: so pattern R ? A ? ?\n\nExamples: ""RADIO"" — R,A,D,I,O — but positions:1=R,2=A,3=D — again pos3 is D, not A.\n\nI need words where the third letter is A.\n\n""MANIA"" is M,A,N,I,A — pos3=N? Not A.\n\nActually, common words: like ""PLANT"" but P,L,A,N,T — here A is position 3.\n\nPLANT: letters P,L,A,N,T — pos1=P,2=L,3=A,4=N,5=T.\n\nSimilarly, ""GRANT"" — G,R,A,N,T — 1=G,2=R,3=A,4=N,5=T.\n\nIn ""GRANT"", we have R at position 2.\n\nFor R at position 1, what about ""RAVEN""? But E is out.\n\n""RALPH"" not common.\n\nPerhaps ""RAMIN""? Not English.\n\n""OASIS"" but O,A,S,I,S — pos3=S? No.\n\nList words with A as third letter.\n\nFrom memory: BLAND, BRAND, CRAMP, etc.\n\nBut for R at position 1: ""RARER""? R,A,R,E,R — but E is out, and A is position 2.\n\n""RAPER"" has E.\n\n""RAZER"" not word.\n\nIt\'s hard to find with R at 1 and A at 3.\n\n""RAYON"" — R,A,Y,O,N? Positions:1=R,2=A,3=Y — not A.\n\nPerhaps I should look for words where R is in another position.\n\nSince R is not at position 4, and position 3 is A, R could be at 1,2, or 5.\n\nPosition 4 is unknown, but cannot be R because R is not at 4 based on feedback? Feedback for position 4 of STARE was R but wrong position, so R is not at position 4 for the secret word.\n\nSimilarly, position 1 cannot be S, position 2 cannot be T? No, feedback says S was at position 1 of guess and x, meaning no S at all. Similarly T at position 2 of guess and x, meaning T not in word. E not in word.\n\nSo secret word: no S, T, E, and has A at position 3, R somewhere not at position 4.\n\nPossible positions for R: 1,2,5.\n\nSince position 4 cannot be R, and position 3 is A, so R at 1,2,5.\n\nNow for second guess, we want to test R in a specific position as well as introduce new letters.\n\nAlso, since we have limited tries, we should cover more common letters.\n\nLet\'s consider positions.\n\nCase 1: R at position 1.\nThen word: R ? A ? ? \n\nWhat words? Like ""RIVAL"" — R,I,V,A,L — but position 3 is V, not A. \n""ROYAL"" — R,O,Y,A,L — positions:1=R,2=O,3=Y?! No.\n\n""RUMBA""? R,U,M,B,A — positions:1=R,2=U,3=M,4=B,5=A — position 5 is A, not 3.\n\nI think I give up on R at 1 for now; it\'s rare.\n\nCase 2: R at position 2.\nThen word: ? R A ? ?\n\nExamples: CRANE — but C,R,A,N,E — E is out.\nPLANE — P,L,A,N,E — E out.\nGRAPE — G,R,A,P,E — E out.\nBRAVE — B,R,A,V,E — E out.\nDRAKE — D,R,A,K,E — E out.\n\nAll end with E issue.\n\n""CRACK"" — C,R,A,C,K — but C and K, and double C? Not good.\n\n""DRAMA"" — D,R,A,M,A — positions:1=D,2=R,3=A,4=M,5=A — possible, but A at pos5 too? We don\'t know.\n\n""BRAND"" — B,R,A,N,D — positions:1=B,2=R,3=A,4=N,5=D — good.\n\n""A"" at position 3, R at position 2.\n\nSimilarly, ""GRAND"" — G,R,A,N,D.\n\n""PRANK"" — P,R,A,N,K.\n\nSo possible words: BRAND, GRAND, PRANK, etc.\n\nBut S,T,E absent, so ""BRAND"" has B,R,A,N,D.\n\nCase 3: R at position 5.\nThen word: ? ? A ? R\n\nExamples: ""SUGAR"" but S out, E not used but S out.\n""NOVAR"" not word.\n""LUNAR"" — L,U,N,A,R? Positions:1=L,2=U,3=N? Not A.\nWe need position 3=A.\n\nSo for R at 5: ? ? A ? R\n\n""POLAR"" — P,O,L,A,R — positions:1=P,2=O,3=L,4=A,5=R — position 3 is L, not A.\n\n""RADAR"" but R at 1 and 5, position 3=D.\n\n""SONAR"" — S O N A R? Position:1=S(out),2=O,3=N,4=A,5=R — position 3 is N, not A.\n\n""MANOR"" — M A N O R — pos1=M,2=A,3=N,4=O,5=R — position 3=N, not A.\n\nIt\'s hard with R at 5 and A at 3.\n\n""VIXEN"" but E out.\n\nPerhaps ""MACAW"" but not with R.\n\nCommon word: think of ""OVARY"" — O V A R Y? Positions:1=O,2=V,3=A,4=R,5=Y — but that has R at position 4, but our feedback says R not at position 4? So cannot be, because we have R not at pos4.\n\nSimilarly, ""CARRY"" has C,A,R,R,Y but double R and position 3=R? Different.\n\nSticking with R at position 2 seems easier.\n\nSo for the guess, we can assume R at position 2, and try ""BRAND"" for example.\n\nBut we don\'t know for sure, so we should keep options open.\n\nThe second guess should help us narrow down.\n\nCurrent constraints:\n- Letter 3: A\n- R is in the word, not at position 4.\n- S, T, E absent.\n- Possible R positions: 1,2,5\n\nI should try a word that has R in position 1 or 2 or 5, and also test other common letters.\n\nSince position 4 cannot be R, we can test letter for position 4.\n\nAlso, we should avoid unused letters if possible, but include common ones.\n\nCommon letters not used yet: I, O, U, L, N, C, D, M, etc.\n\nFor instance, include O, or I or L, N, etc.\n\nLet\'s list candidate words for second guess.\n\nPossible words with A at pos 3, and R somewhere not 4.\n\nExamples:\n- If R at pos 2: ""BRAND"" (B,R,A,N,D)\n- ""GRAND"" (G,R,A,N,D)\n- ""PRANK"" (P,R,A,N,K)\n- ""CRANK"" (C,R,A,N,K) — but C and K\n- ""DRAIN"" (D,R,A,I,N) — I is vowel, good\n\nIf R at pos 1: hard to find; ""RABIC"" not word; ""RAPID"" not A at 3 as above.\n\n""MAJAR"" not word.\n\nAssume R at pos 2 for common words.\n\nIf R at pos 5: ""TONER"" but T out, E out.\n""COVER"" E out.\n""MINOR"" R at 5, but position 3 N? Not A.\n\n""SUPER"" S out.\n\nNot easy.\n\nSo probably R is at position 2 in many cases.\n\nFor second guess, I can choose ""BRAND"" to test B, R, N, D.\n\nR is at position 2, which might be correct or not.\n\nBut also, ""DRAIN"" has I which is a common vowel.\n\n""DRAIN"": D,R,A,I,N — positions:1=D,2=R,3=A,4=I,5=N\n\nHere R at position 2.\n\nSimilarly, ""BRAVO"" — B,R,A,V,O — but O is vowel.\n\nV is less common.\n\nLet\'s evaluate letters. From the first guess, we know A and R are in, so we can focus on finding their positions.\n\nSpecifically, we need to find where R is.\n\nSince it\'s not at 4, and 3 is A, R must be at 1,2, or 5.\n\nTo test this, I can guess a word with R at one of these positions.\n\nFor example, if I guess a word with R at position 1, and if it gets a check or minus, I\'ll know.\n\nSimilarly for other positions.\n\nBut since we have A fixed at position 3, it might restrict the word.\n\nAnother idea: guess a word that has R at position 2, as in ""CRANE"" but E out.\n\n""ORCIN"" not word.\n\nChose ""GRAPH"" — G,R,A,P,H — position 1=G,2=R,3=A,4=P,5=H — P and H are uncommon, but possible.\n\nBut P and H are less common; better to use common letters.\n\n""BRAIN"" — B,R,A,I,N — this is good: B,R,A,I,N\n\nPositions:1=B,2=R,3=A,4=I,5=N\n\nIn this guess, position 4 is I, which we can test.\n\nAlso, B, I, N are new letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""FLAIR"" but L,A,I,R — positions:1=F,2=L,3=A,4=I,5=R — but R at position 5 here, which is an option.\n\nIn ""FLAIR"", we have L and F.\n\nBut let\'s compare to ""BRAIN"".\n\nI think ""BRAIN"" is a good choice: it has R at position 2 (which might be correct), A at position 3 fixed, and uses B, I, N – common letters.\n\nIf R is not at position 2, say if R is at position 1 or 5, then in this guess, 4=I,5=N, so if R is at 5, position 4 could be something else.\n\nBut we\'ll get feedback.\n\nFeedback would tell if B, I, N are present, and position of R.\n\nThe word must not have E,S,T, and has A at 3, R somewhere.\n\nSo guess ""BRAIN"".\n\n""TRAIN"" has T, which is out.\n\nNo, T is absent.\n\nSo ""BRAIN"" (B,R,A,I,N) is valid.\n\nOther options: ""DRAIN"" (D,R,A,I,N), similar.\n\n""GRAIN"" (G,R,A,I,N).\n\nAny of these is fine.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""BRAIN"".\n\nTo vary letters, since in STARE we had S,T,A,R,E, now B,I,N are new.\n\nN is common.\n\nSo my second guess: ""BRAIN"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm the pattern: for ""BRAIN"", position 1=B, 2=R, 3=A, 4=I, 5=N.\n\nA at pos 3 fixed.\n\nR at pos 2.\n\nIf the secret word has R at pos 1, for example, then in ""BRAIN"", R is at pos 2, which would show as ""-"" if R is present but not at pos 2? Feedback will show R as ""-"" for wrong position only if R is elsewhere.\n\nBut we already know R is in the word, so if we guess R at pos 2, and it\'s not there, it will show ""-"" and we know it\'s not at 2.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess a word with R at pos 1, but with A at 3.\n\nFor example, ""CRAMP"" — C,R,A,M,P — but C at 1, R at 2? No, C,R,A,M,P.\n\nPosition:1=C,2=R,3=A,4=M,5=P.\n\nR at pos 2.\n\nOr ""WRACK"" — W,R,A,C,K — same.\n\nNo word with R at 1 and A at 3 easily.\n\nSo I\'ll use ""BRAIN"" as second guess.<thinking>\nBased on the feedback from the first guess ""STARE"":  \n- S: not in the secret word (x)  \n- T: not in the secret word (x)  \n- A: correct letter and position (✓), so A is the third letter.  \n- R: in the secret word but wrong position (-), so R is present but not at position 4.  \n- E: not in the secret word (x)  \n\nKey insights:  \n1. The secret word has A as the third letter (pattern: _ _ A _ _).  \n2. R is in the word but not in position 4—possible positions are 1, 2, or 5.  \n3. S, T, and E are absent—must avoid these letters.  \n\nFor the second guess:  \n- Prioritize testing the position of R (likely in positions 1, 2, or 5) while keeping A fixed at position 3.  \n- Include new common vowels/consonants not yet tested: focus on letters like B, I, N, L, O, etc.  \n- Aim for a valid word that fits: ? ? A ? ?  \n\nGood candidates:  \n- ""BRAIN"": B R A I N  \n  - Positions: B(1), R(2), A(3), I(4), N(5)  \n  - Tests R at position 2, which might be correct. Introduces B, I, N—common letters.  \n- ""BRAND"": B R A N D  \n  - Similar, but N at position 4 and D at 5 (less vowel coverage).  \n- ""DRAIN"": D R A I N  \n  - Less common starting letter D.  \n\n""BRAIN"" is selected because:  \n- It tests R at position 2 (a common spot).  \n- Provides information on B (new consonant), I (new vowel), and N (new consonant).  \n- Fits all constraints (no S/T/E, A at position 3).  \n</thinking>\n\n<guess>BRAIN</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(✓) R(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: BRAIN -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) A(✓) I(x) N(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nFirst guess: STARE\n- S: x (not in word)\n- T: x (not in word)\n- A: ✓ (correct letter and position, so position 3 is A)\n- R: - (in word but wrong position, so R is in the word but not at position 4)\n- E: x (not in word)\n\nSecond guess: BRAIN\n- B: x (not in word)\n- R: ✓ (correct letter and position, so position 2 is R)\n- A: ✓ (correct letter and position, so position 3 is A, which we already knew)\n- I: x (not in word)\n- N: - (in word but wrong position, so N is in the word but not at position 5)\n\nNow, combining the information:\n\n1. Position 2 is R (from second guess, R is correct at position 2)\n2. Position 3 is A (from first guess, confirmed again)\n3. R is in the word, but we now know it is at position 2, so the earlier feedback about R not at position 4 is consistent.\n4. N is in the word but not at position 5.\n5. S, T, E, B, I are not in the word.\n\nSo the secret word has:\n- Position 2: R\n- Position 3: A\n- N is present, but not at position 5.\n- No S, T, E, B, I.\n\nThe pattern so far: _ R A _ _\n\nWe need to find the first, fourth, and fifth letters.\n\nN is in the word but not at position 5, so it must be at position 1 or 4? Positions are 1,2,3,4,5. Position 2 and 3 are taken by R and A, so N can be at position 1 or 4.\n\nBut position 4 is available, and position 1 is available.\n\nAlso, we need to avoid S, T, E, B, I.\n\nNow, for the third guess, we should try to find a word that fits the pattern _ R A _ _ and includes N in position 1 or 4, and tests other common letters.\n\nSince N is not at position 5, if we put N at position 4, we can test that.\n\nAlternatively, we can put N at position 1 and see.\n\nBut we need to cover more letters.\n\nCommon letters left: O, U, L, D, C, M, P, etc.\n\nVowels: O, U (since A is used, and E, I are out).\n\nConsonants: L, N, C, D, M, P, G, K, etc.\n\nNow, the word must have N in it, at position 1 or 4.\n\nLet\'s consider possibilities.\n\nFirst, if N is at position 1: then word is N R A _ _\n\nWhat can the last two be? And must not have S,T,E,B,I.\n\nExamples: ""NRAIL"" not a word.\n\n""NRAPE"" not and E out.\n\n""DRANK"" but D is possible, but position 1 is N, not D.\n\nN R A _ _\n\n""CRANE"" but C and E out.\n\n""GRAND"" but G, and D at 5?

Not N.\n\n""DRONE"" E out.\n\n""GROAN"" — G R O A N? Positions:1=G,2=R,3=O?

W R A C K — but C at 4, not N.\n\nWRACK has no N.\n\nSo only if we have N at 4.\n\nOther words: ""URBAN"" — U R B A N — positions:1=U,2=R,3=B? Not A, position 3 is B, not A.\n\n""BARON"" but B out, and position 3 O? Not A.\n\nSo the common ones are DRANK, FRANK, PRANK.\n\nAlso, ""CROWN"" but position 3 O.\n\nNot.\n\n""BRAWN"" B out, and position 3 A? B R A W N — positions:1=B(out),2=R,3=A,4=W,5=N — but B is out, so not possible.\n\nSimilarly, ""DRAWN"" — D R A W N — positions:1=D,2=R,3=A,4=W,5=N — this could be, but W and N.\n\nN at position 5? But feedback says N is not at position 5, so in ""DRAWN"", N is at position 5, which is invalid because N cannot be at position 5.\n\nFeedback from BRAIN: N is in word but not at position 5, so N cannot be at position 5.\n\nTherefore, in the secret word, N is not at position 5, so for pattern _ R A _ _, N must be at position 1 or 4.\n\nIf at position 4, then word is _ R A N _\n\nIf at position 1, then N R A _ _\n\nBut N R A _ _ words are rare, like ""NRA something"", but not common English words.\n\nFor example, ""NRAKA"" not word.\n\nSo probably N is at position 4.\n\nThus, pattern: _ R A N _\n\nNow, position 1 and 5 to be filled.\n\nPosition 1: cannot be S,T,E,B,I (excluded letters), so possible: C,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z but common: C,D,F,G,K,L,M,O,P,U,W\n\nPosition 5: similarly, cannot be S,T,E,B,I, and not N (since N at 4, but N can be only once? Not necessarily, but we don\'t know if duplicate letters. But in feedback, for N, it was only one N in BRAIN, but secret could have multiple. However, we don\'t have information, so assume no duplicate for now.\n\nCommon words with pattern _ R A N _:\n\n- DRANK: D R A N K\n- FRANK: F R A N K\n- PRANK: P R A N K\n- CRANK: C R A N K\n- WRANK not word\n- GRAND: but that has D at 5, but N at 4? GRAND is G,R,A,N,D so position 4=N, 5=D.\n\nGRAND is possible.\n\nSimilarly, BRAND but B out.\n\nSo possible: CRANK, DRANK, FRANK, PRANK, GRAND.\n\nGRAND has G at 1, R at 2, A at 3, N at 4, D at 5.\n\nIn DRANK, D at 1, K at 5.\n\nEtc.\n\nFor the third guess, we can choose one that tests new letters.\n\nFor example, ""CRANK"" has C and K.\n\n""PRANK"" has P and K.\n\n""GRAND"" has G and D.\n\nSince we need to find position 1 and 5, we can choose a word that uses common letters.\n\nAlso, we might want to test if K is present, or D, etc.\n\nAnother idea: since we have limited guesses, we can choose a word that has multiple possibilities.\n\nBut we have 4 guesses left, so we can test.\n\nPerhaps ""CRANK"" to test C and K.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback.\n\nWe also have to consider that the word must be valid.\n\nAnother common word: ""URBAN"" but position 3 is B, not A.\n\nNot.\n\n""ORGAN"" O R G A N — positions:1=O,2=R,3=G? Not A, position 3 is G, not A.\n\nSo not.\n\nSo the main candidates are CRANK, DRANK, FRANK, PRANK, GRAND.\n\nNow, from second guess, we have N not at 5, which is satisfied if N at 4.\n\nIn GRAND, N is at 4, D at 5.\n\nIn DRANK, N at 4, K at 5.\n\nEtc.\n\nFor the third guess, I can pick ""FRANK"" for example.\n\nBut let\'s think about what letters we haven\'t tested.\n\nWe have tested: S,T,A,R,E,B,I,N\n\nA and R are in, N is in.\n\nExcluded: S,T,E,B,I\n\nNot tested: C,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z\n\nCommon: C,D,F,G,K,L,M,O,P,U,W\n\nIn ""FRANK"": F,R,A,N,K\n\nF and K are new.\n\nSimilarly, ""PRANK"": P,R,A,N,K\n\nP and K.\n\n""CRANK"": C,R,A,N,K\n\nC and K.\n\n""GRAND"": G,R,A,N,D\n\nG and D.\n\n""DRANK"": D,R,A,N,K\n\nD and K.\n\nTo maximize information, we might want to include a vowel, like O or U.\n\nBut in the pattern _ R A N _, position 5 is a consonant in these words.\n\nFor example, ""GROAN"" but position 3 not A.\n\nNot possible.\n\n""WRUNG"" not pattern.\n\nSo no vowel at position 5 easily.\n\nPosition 1 could be a vowel, like U, but ""URBAN"" not.\n\n""ORANT"" not word.\n\nSo probably not.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""CRANK"" to test C and K.\n\nBut C and K are less common than D or G.\n\n""GRAND"" has G and D, which are more common.\n\nG is more common than C or K.\n\nLetter frequencies: E,A,R,I,O,T,N,S,L,C,... so C is common, D is common, G less so.\n\nD is more common than G.\n\nIn English, E,A,R,I,O,T,N,S,L,C,U,D,P,M...\n\nD is about 4.3%, P is about 2%, C is 2.7%, K is 0.8%, etc.\n\nBut for Wordle, it might vary.\n\nSince we have N at position 4, and we need position 1 and 5.\n\nIf I guess ""GRAND"", for example, and if it\'s not correct, we get feedback on G and D.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut we can choose a word that doesn\'t necessarily have N at 4, to test if N is at position 1.\n\nFor example, guess a word with N at position 1: N R A ? ?\n\nBut what word? ""NRA something"" — ""NRAIL"" not, ""NRAKE"" not, ""NRAGE"" not, ""DRAIN"" but D R A I N, but I is out, and position 4 I is x, so not.\n\n""TRAIN"" T out.\n\n""GRAIN"" G R A I N, but I out.\n\nSo no common word with N at position 1 and A at 3.\n\nTherefore, N must be at position 4.\n\nSo pattern is _ R A N _\n\nNow, for the third guess, I\'ll choose ""DRANK"" to test D and K.\n\n""DRANK"": D R A N K\n\nPositions:1=D,2=R,3=A,4=N,5=K\n\nIf D is correct, it will show ✓, similarly for K.\n\nIf not, we know.\n\nBut we have other options.\n\nSince we have multiple possibilities, we can choose a word that covers more common letters.\n\nAnother idea: guess a word that has O or U, but in this pattern, it\'s hard.\n\nFor example, ""CROWN"" not.\n\n""BROWN"" B out.\n\nNot.\n\nSo I think ""DRANK"" is fine.\n\nBut let\'s list all possible words to see.\n\nPossible secret words: from Wordle word list, but I don\'t have it, so common words.\n\nCRANK, DRANK, FRANK, PRANK, GRAND.\n\nAlso, ""WRANG"" not.\n\n""TRANS"" T out.\n\n""BRING"" B out, and position 3 I? Not A.\n\nSo about 5 possibilities: CRANK, DRANK, FRANK, PRANK, GRAND.\n\nGRAND has D at 5, while others have K at 5 except GRAND.\n\nIn GRAND, position 5 is D, in others K.\n\nFor the third guess, we can guess one of them to narrow down.\n\nSince we have 4 guesses left, it\'s ok.\n\nBut to be efficient, we can guess a word that tests multiple.\n\nFor example, if I guess ""CRANK"", and if it\'s not correct, we get feedback on C and K.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut let\'s see what the feedback can tell us.\n\nPerhaps guess a word that is not necessarily possible, but tests letters.\n\nFor example, guess ""CROWN"" but position 3 not A.\n\nNot possible because position 3 must be A.\n\nAll guesses must have A at position 3 and R at position 2, because we know R is at position 2.\n\nFrom second guess, R is at position 2, so it must be in the secret word at position 2.\n\nSo all future guesses must have R at position 2 and A at position 3.\n\nSo pattern: ? R A ? ?\n\nAnd N is in the word, not at position 5, so at position 1 or 4.\n\nBut position 1 and 4 are available.\n\nFor the guess, we can have N at position 1 or 4 or not, but we know N is in the word.\n\nIn the third guess, we can put N at position 4 to test.\n\nOr at position 1.\n\nBut position 1 with N is hard, so put at position 4.\n\nSo guess a word with pattern ? R A N ?\n\nThen position 1 and 5 to be guessed.\n\nFor example, ""CRANK"" or ""DRANK"" etc.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""GRAND"" to test G and D.\n\n""GRAND"": G R A N D\n\nThen if G is correct, position 1 is G, and D at 5.\n\nIf not, we know.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut let\'s choose.\n\nSince K is common in many, perhaps guess ""PRANK"" to test P and K.\n\nBut P and K are less common.\n\n""FRANK"" has F, which is less common.\n\n""CRANK"" has C, which is common.\n\nC is more common.\n\nBut in ""CRANK"", position 5 is K.\n\n""GRAND"" has G and D, both common.\n\nD is more common than K.\n\nSo ""GRAND"" might be better.\n\nAlso, ""DRANK"" has D and K, D common, K less.\n\nBut ""GRAND"" has G and D.\n\nI think ""GRAND"" is a good choice.\n\nSo third guess: ""GRAND""\n\nBut let\'s confirm the pattern: G R A N D\n\nPosition 1: G, 2: R, 3: A, 4: N, 5: D\n\nNow, feedback will tell us about G, N, and D.\n\nWe know R and A are correct.\n\nN is in the word, but not at position 5, here it is at position 4, so if N is at position 4 in secret, it might be correct or not, but we know N is present.\n\nIf position 4 is N in secret, then it will be ✓ for N.\n\nIf not, then N is at position 1, and position 4 is something else.\n\nBut we\'ll see.\n\nI think it\'s fine.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""GRAND"".### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Feedback from Previous Guesses:**\n   - **Guess 1: STARE** → Feedback: S(x) T(x) A(✓) R(-) E(x)\n     - A is correct and in position 3.\n     - R is in the word but not in position 4.\n     - S, T, E are absent.\n   - **Guess 2: BRAIN** → Feedback: B(x) R(✓) A(✓) I(x) N(-)\n     - R is correct and in position 2 (confirming position 2 is R).\n     - A is correct and in position 3 (redundant but consistent).\n     - N is in the word but not in position 5.\n     - B and I are absent.\n\n2. **Key Insights:**\n   - **Positions confirmed:**\n     - Position 2: R\n     - Position 3: A\n     - Pattern so far: `_ R A _ _`\n   - **Letters present but position unknown:**\n     - N is in the word, but not at position 5. Since positions 2 and 3 are fixed, N must be at position 1 or 4.\n   - **Absent letters:** S, T, E, B, I (cannot be used).\n   - **Possible positions for N:**\n     - If N is at position 1, the pattern is `N R A _ _`.\n     - If N is at position 4, the pattern is `_ R A N _`.\n     - Common English words with `N R A _ _` are rare (e.g., ""NRA"" words are uncommon). Thus, N is more likely at position 4, leading to the pattern `_ R A N _`.\n   - **Remaining positions to solve:** Position 1 and position 5.\n     - Position 1: Must be a letter not in {S, T, E, B, I}.

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: STARE
- S: x (not in word)
- T: x (not in word)
- A: ✓ (correct letter and position, position 3)
- R: - (in word but wrong position, not at position 4)
- E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: BRAIN
- B: x (not in word)
- R: ✓ (correct letter and position, position 2)
- A: ✓ (correct letter and position, position 3)
- I: x (not in word)
- N: - (in word but wrong position, not at position 5)

Guess 3: GRAND
- G: x (not in word)
- R: ✓ (correct letter and position, position 2)
- A: ✓ (correct letter and position, position 3)
- N: ✓ (correct letter and position, position 4)
- D: x (not in word)

Now, combining all information:

1. Positions:
   - Position 2: R (confirmed by guess 2 and 3)
   - Position 3: A (confirmed)
   - Position 4: N (confirmed by guess 3)
   - Position 1: unknown, but not S,T,E,B,I,G (excluded)
   - Position 5: unknown, but not S,T,E,B,I,N? From guess 2, N not at position 5, but now we know N is at position 4. Also D is out.

2. Letters not in word: S,T,E,B,I,G,D
   - So excluded: S,T,E,B,I,G,D

3. Known letters in word: R,A,N
   - R at position 2, A at 3, N at 4.

4. Pattern: _ R A N _

5. Position 1 and 5 to be found.

6. Excluded letters: S,T,E,B,I,G,D

7. Possible letters for position 1: anything except S,T,E,B,I,G,D and must be English letters.

8. Position 5: similarly, except also N is used but position 5 could be other letter, even duplicate? But no duplicate indication, so assume single letters.

9. We know N is only at position 4.

10. We need to find position 1 and 5.

11. Common remaining letters: C,F,H,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

12. Since we have to form a word, possible words: pattern ? R A N ?

Examples:
- C R A N K
- F R A N K
- P R A N K
- Also, W R A N K? But W,R,A,N,K — WRANK not word?
Common words: CRANK, FRANK, PRANK

Also, ""URAN"" not 5 letters.

""ORANG"" not English.

""IRANI"" I out, and not pattern.

So likely CRANK, FRANK, PRANK.

In GRAND, D was guessed and not in word, so position 5 not D.

Similarly, in BRAIN, B and I out.

From the pattern, only possibilities are CRANK, FRANK, PRANK.

For fourth guess, we need to choose among these or another word that fits and tests the possibilities.

But since we have only three options, we can guess one.

For example, guess ""CRANK"" – if not, then we know.

Similarly.

To choose, ""FRANK"" has F which is less common, ""PRANK"" has P, ""CRANK"" has C.

C is most common among F,P,C.

But let's see letter frequencies: C is common, F less, P similar.

Perhaps guess ""CRANK"" first.

But all are almost equally likely.

Since we have a only a few, we can guess ""CRANK"".

If it's not ""CRANK"", we have two left, and three guesses.

But we can be efficient.

Another possibility: ""WRUNG"" not the pattern.

I think CRANK, FRANK, PRANK are the main ones.

So for this guess, I'll choose ""CRANK"".

So fourth guess: ""CRANK""

Pattern: C R A N K

If correct, done.

If not, we get feedback.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Review previous feedback:**
   - **Guess 1 (STARE):** S(x), T(x), A(✓) in position 3, R(-) present but not position 4, E(x) → Reveals:
     - Secret word contains A (position 3) and R (not position 4).
     - S, T, E are absent.
   - **Guess 2 (BRAIN):** B(x), R(✓) in position 2, A(✓) in position 3, I(x), N(-) present but not position 5 → Reveals:
     - Confirms R (position 2) and A (position 3).
     - N is present but not in position 5.
     - B and I are absent.
   - **Guess 3 (GRAND):** G(x), R(✓) in position 2, A(✓) in position 3, N(✓) in position 4, D(x) → Reveals:
     - Confirms R (position 2), A (position 3), and N (position 4).
     - G and D are absent.

2. **Consolidate known information:**
   - **Secret word pattern:** Positions:
     - Position 2: R
     - Position 3: A
     - Position 4: N
     - Position 1: Unknown (cannot be S, T, E, B, I, G, D)
     - Position 5: Unknown (cannot be S, T, E, B, I, G, D, and not N due to position 4)
     - Thus, pattern is `_ R A N _`.
   - **Absent letters:** S, T, E, B, I, G, D (must exclude these).
   - **Remaining possibilities:** Only valid English words fitting `_ R A N _` with absent letters excluded are:
     - CRANK (C in position 1, K in position 5)
     - FRANK (F in position 1, K in position 5)
     - PRANK (P in position 1, K in position 5)
     - Other words (like WRANK) are invalid/not English.

3. **Strategy for fourth guess:**
   - Test one of the three candidates (CRANK, FRANK, PRANK) to resolve position 1 and 5.
   - Prioritize **CRANK** because:
     - C is a common starting letter (high frequency in English).
     - Tests K in position 5—if correct, solves the word; if not, eliminates C and K (narrowing to FRANK or PRANK).
     - Balances efficiency: With 3 guesses left, testing CRANK first maximizes information if incorrect (e.g., if C/K absent, FRANK or PRANK is likely).

4. **Conclusion:** Guess **CRANK** to confirm/discard C and K while covering the pattern.

Guess 1: STARE

- T: x (not in word)
- A: ✓ (correct letter and position, position 3)

   - Position 4: N (confirmed by guess 3)
   - Position 1: unknown, but not S,T,E,B,I,G (excluded)
   - Position 5: unknown, but not S,T,E,B,I,N? From guess 2, N not at position 5, but now we know N is at position 4. Also D is out.

2. Letters not in word: S,T,E,B,I,G,D
   - So excluded: S,T,E,B,I,G,D

3. Known letters in word: R,A,N
   - R at position 2, A at 3, N at 4.

4. Pattern: _ R A N _

5. Position 1 and 5 to be found.

6. Excluded letters: S,T,E,B,I,G,D

7. Possible letters for position 1: anything except S,T,E,B,I,G,D and must be English letters.

8. Position 5: similarly, except also N is used but position 5 could be other letter, even duplicate? But no duplicate indication, so assume single letters.

9. We know N is only at position 4.

10. We need to find position 1 and 5.

11. Common remaining letters: C,F,H,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

12. Since we have to form a word, possible words: pattern ? R A N ?

Examples:
- C R A N K
- F R A N K
- P R A N K
- Also, W R A N K? But W,R,A,N,K — WRANK not word?
Common words: CRANK, FRANK, PRANK

Also, ""URAN"" not 5 letters.

""ORANG"" not English.

""IRANI"" I out, and not pattern.

So likely CRANK, FRANK, PRANK.

In GRAND, D was guessed and not in word, so position 5 not D.

Similarly, in BRAIN, B and I out.

From the pattern, only possibilities are CRANK, FRANK, PRANK.

For fourth guess, we need to choose among these or another word that fits and tests the possibilities.

But since we have only three options, we can guess one.

For example, guess ""CRANK"" – if not, then we know.

Similarly.

To choose, ""FRANK"" has F which is less common, ""PRANK"" has P, ""CRANK"" has C.

C is most common among F,P,C.

But let's see letter frequencies: C is common, F less, P similar.

Perhaps guess ""CRANK"" first.

But all are almost equally likely.

Since we have a only a few, we can guess ""CRANK"".

If it's not ""CRANK"", we have two left, and three guesses.

But we can be efficient.

Another possibility: ""WRUNG"" not the pattern.

I think CRANK, FRANK, PRANK are the main ones.

So for this guess, I'll choose ""CRANK"".

So fourth guess: ""CRANK""

I recall that in Wordle, common starting words include words with frequent vowels and consonants. Letters like E, A, R, S, T are very common in English words. So, I should choose a word that includes several of these.

Some popular starting words are ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", ""TRACE"", etc. These cover multiple vowels and common consonants.

Let me think about the vowels: A, E, I, O, U are vowels, and I should try to include at least one or two. Consonants like R, S, T, N, L are also frequent.

For example, ""ROAST"" has R, O, A, S, T – that's good because it includes two vowels (O and A) and common consonants.

""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E – R, A, E are common.

""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E.

""SALET"" is another one, but it's less common.

I want a word that is all unique letters to cover more ground. Duplicate letters would give less information.

Let me list possible first guesses: I can start with ""CRANE"".

Why ""CRANE""? It has C, R, A, N, E. C is not as common as S or T, but E, A, R are very frequent. R is a common consonant, E is the most common vowel, A is also common.

Alternatives: ""RAISE"" has R,A,I,S,E – lots of vowels and common consonants.

""IRATE"" – I,R,A,T,E.

But perhaps ""CRANE"" is a solid choice.

Since the feedback will tell me which letters are in the word and their positions, I should try to cover different positions.

But for the first guess, position isn't as critical because I don't have any information.

I think ""CRANE"" is a balanced choice.

Another common one is ""ADIEU"" which has many vowels – A,D,I,E,U. That might be good for vowel coverage, but consonants are important too.

""SLATE"" seems better: S,L,A,T,E – S and T are very common consonants.

S, L, A, T, E – L is common but not as frequent as S or T.

Let me check letter frequencies in English.

According to data, the most common letters in 5-letter words are: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, etc.

Specifically for Wordle, from past games, E, S, A, O, R, I, L, T are top letters.

So, a word with S, E, A, R, T might be ideal.

""STARE"" – S,T,A,R,E – that includes S, T, A, R, E – all highly common letters.

Similarly, ""ROAST"" was R,O,A,S,T – O instead of E.

E is more frequent than O, so ""STARE"" might be slightly better.

""CRANE"" has C and N, which are less common.

I should go with ""STARE"".

But ""SLATE"" is S,L,A,T,E – L is slightly less common than R.

""STARE"" has R, which is good.

Another popular one is ""CRATE"" – C,R,A,T,E – C is less common.

""RAISE"" – R,A,I,S,E – I is common.

To maximize, perhaps ""STARE"" or ""SALET"".

I think ""STARE"" is a good choice for first guess.

But let me confirm: S, T, A, R, E – position-wise, S and E are often at ends, but it's fine.

Since I have to output in the format, I'll go with ""STARE"".

The response format requires me to think step by step, then output the guess.

So for my thought process: I should choose a starting word that includes common letters to gather as much feedback as possible. The letters S, T, A, R, and E are among the most frequent in English words, so ""STARE"" is an effective first guess. It will help identify correct letters and positions, or at least presence/absence, which can guide subsequent guesses.

I think that's reasonable.<thinking>
For the first guess in Wordle, it's best to choose a word that includes a variety of common vowels and consonants to maximize information from the feedback. Common starting words often use letters like E, A, R, S, T, L, which appear frequently in English words. After considering several options like ""CRANE"" (C, R, A, N, E), ""ROAST"" (R, O, A, S, T), and ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E), I selected ""STARE"" as it includes S, T, A, R, E—all highly common letters. This choice covers multiple vowels (A and E) and high-frequency consonants (S, T, R), increasing the likelihood of identifying letters in the secret word. Since the letters are all unique, it avoids redundancy and provides more useful feedback on letter presence and position.

<guess>STARE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(✓) R(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess ""STARE"":
- S: x (not in the word)
- T: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct letter and correct position, so A is the third letter)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position; since position is wrong and it was fourth, R is in the word but not at position 4)
- E: x (not in the word)

From this, we know:
- The secret word contains an 'A' as the third letter.
- It also contains an 'R', but not as the fourth letter (since position is wrong).
- Letters S, T, E are not in the word at all.

We need to make a second guess that is a 5-letter word with:
- 'A' in the third position (because A is confirmed there).
- Must include 'R' somewhere, but not in the fourth position.
- Should not include S, T, E.
- We can include other common letters to test more possibilities.

Given that S, T, E are out, we have to choose from other letters.

We also need to consider that R is in the word but not in position 4. Possible positions for R: since the word has positions 1,2,3,4,5 and we know position 3 is A, so R cannot be at 3. Possible positions: 1,2,4,5? But position 4 is excluded from the feedback? Wait no: the feedback for R is ""-"", meaning present but not at position 4. So R could be at position 1,2, or 5? But we don't know yet.

Positions: 
1: unknown
2: unknown
3: A
4: unknown, but cannot be R? Actually, from feedback, R is not at 4, but it could be at 1,2, or 5.
Position 5 is possible.

Also, S, T, E are absent, so we avoid those.

What common letters can we use? We might want to test other vowels and consonants.

Other vowels: we have O, I, U, Y sometimes, but in this case E is out.

Consonants: common ones like L, N, C, D, etc.

Since we need to place R somewhere, we can try R in position 1 or 2 or 5.

Let me think of words that have ""A"" in the third position.

The pattern is: ? ? A ? ?

And one of the other positions must include R.

Also, no S, T, E.

For example:
- If R is at position 1: R ? A ? ?
- If R is at position 2: ? R A ? ?
- If R is at position 5: ? ? A ? R

Also, we might want to use common letters for the other positions to test.

Common letters not excluded: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But for Wordle, we need likely letters.

Perhaps include O or I, L, N, etc.

Let me brainstorm words:

First, suppose R is at position 1: R ? A ? ?

Possible words: ROUND? But O U N D—position 3 is A, not O. Must be A at 3.

So: R _ A _ _

Examples: RABID (R A B I D — but position 3 is A? R A B I D: position1=R, pos2=A? No, we need pos3 to be A. Here pos2 is A, not pos3.

Word structure: letter1, letter2, A, letter4, letter5.

For R at pos1: R ? A ? ?

Like: RADAR? But R A D A R — but we have A at pos2 and pos4? But we need only pos3 known so far, but in RADAR, A is also at pos2 and pos4? But that could be.

But RADAR would have two As? Not necessarily a problem.

But position 3 is D in RADAR? R-A-D-A-R, so position 3 is D, but we need position 3 to be A? I think I'm confusing.

R A D A R:
Pos1: R, pos2: A, pos3: D, pos4: A, pos5: R.

But we need position 3 to be A, so that won't work.

For R in pos1, the word must have pos3=A, so letter1=R, letter2=?, letter3=A, letter4=?, letter5=?

So examples: REALM? But E is out, we cannot use E.

Also, R is used, but that's fine.

Possible words: 
- RICAN? Not a word.
- RACED? E is out.
- RABID: pos: R, A, B, I, D? But pos2 is A, not pos3. We need pos2 to be something, and pos3=A.

For R at pos1: R letter2 A letter4 letter5.

Letter3 is A, that's fixed.

Words: ROYAL — R O Y A L? But that would be pos1=R, pos2=O, pos3=Y, pos4=A, pos5=L? No, we need pos3=A, not Y.

I think I'm messing up positions.

The word should be: position 1: R (or whatever), position 2: ?, position 3: A, position 4: ?, position 5: ?

So for R at position 1: R (1), ? (2), A (3), ? (4), ? (5)

Words like: ""RAPID"" — R,A,P,I,D — positions: 1:R, 2:A, 3:P? That's not A at3.

Standard: in ""RAPID"", positions: 1=R, 2=A, 3=P, 4=I, 5=D. So position 3 is P, not A.

To have position 3=A, the word must have A as the third letter.

For example: ""CRAWL"" — C,R,A,W,L — positions:1=C,2=R,3=A,4=W,5=L. Here pos3=A.

Similarly, ""BRAWL"" — B,R,A,W,L — same pattern? B R A W L: 1=B,2=R,3=A,4=W,5=L.

But R is in the word, and in this case at position 2.

Back to R at position 1.

What word has first letter R and third letter A: so pattern R ? A ? ?

Examples: ""RADIO"" — R,A,D,I,O — but positions:1=R,2=A,3=D — again pos3 is D, not A.

I need words where the third letter is A.

""MANIA"" is M,A,N,I,A — pos3=N? Not A.

Actually, common words: like ""PLANT"" but P,L,A,N,T — here A is position 3.

PLANT: letters P,L,A,N,T — pos1=P,2=L,3=A,4=N,5=T.

Similarly, ""GRANT"" — G,R,A,N,T — 1=G,2=R,3=A,4=N,5=T.

In ""GRANT"", we have R at position 2.

For R at position 1, what about ""RAVEN""? But E is out.

""RALPH"" not common.

Perhaps ""RAMIN""? Not English.

""OASIS"" but O,A,S,I,S — pos3=S? No.

List words with A as third letter.

From memory: BLAND, BRAND, CRAMP, etc.

But for R at position 1: ""RARER""? R,A,R,E,R — but E is out, and A is position 2.

""RAPER"" has E.

""RAZER"" not word.

It's hard to find with R at 1 and A at 3.

""RAYON"" — R,A,Y,O,N? Positions:1=R,2=A,3=Y — not A.

Perhaps I should look for words where R is in another position.

Since R is not at position 4, and position 3 is A, R could be at 1,2, or 5.

Position 4 is unknown, but cannot be R because R is not at 4 based on feedback? Feedback for position 4 of STARE was R but wrong position, so R is not at position 4 for the secret word.

Similarly, position 1 cannot be S, position 2 cannot be T? No, feedback says S was at position 1 of guess and x, meaning no S at all. Similarly T at position 2 of guess and x, meaning T not in word. E not in word.

So secret word: no S, T, E, and has A at position 3, R somewhere not at position 4.

Possible positions for R: 1,2,5.

Since position 4 cannot be R, and position 3 is A, so R at 1,2,5.

Now for second guess, we want to test R in a specific position as well as introduce new letters.

Also, since we have limited tries, we should cover more common letters.

Let's consider positions.

Case 1: R at position 1.
Then word: R ? A ? ? 

What words? Like ""RIVAL"" — R,I,V,A,L — but position 3 is V, not A. 
""ROYAL"" — R,O,Y,A,L — positions:1=R,2=O,3=Y?! No.

""RUMBA""? R,U,M,B,A — positions:1=R,2=U,3=M,4=B,5=A — position 5 is A, not 3.

I think I give up on R at 1 for now; it's rare.

Case 2: R at position 2.
Then word: ? R A ? ?

Examples: CRANE — but C,R,A,N,E — E is out.
PLANE — P,L,A,N,E — E out.
GRAPE — G,R,A,P,E — E out.
BRAVE — B,R,A,V,E — E out.
DRAKE — D,R,A,K,E — E out.

All end with E issue.

""CRACK"" — C,R,A,C,K — but C and K, and double C? Not good.

""DRAMA"" — D,R,A,M,A — positions:1=D,2=R,3=A,4=M,5=A — possible, but A at pos5 too? We don't know.

""BRAND"" — B,R,A,N,D — positions:1=B,2=R,3=A,4=N,5=D — good.

""A"" at position 3, R at position 2.

Similarly, ""GRAND"" — G,R,A,N,D.

""PRANK"" — P,R,A,N,K.

So possible words: BRAND, GRAND, PRANK, etc.

But S,T,E absent, so ""BRAND"" has B,R,A,N,D.

Case 3: R at position 5.
Then word: ? ? A ? R

Examples: ""SUGAR"" but S out, E not used but S out.
""NOVAR"" not word.
""LUNAR"" — L,U,N,A,R? Positions:1=L,2=U,3=N? Not A.
We need position 3=A.

So for R at 5: ? ? A ? R

""POLAR"" — P,O,L,A,R — positions:1=P,2=O,3=L,4=A,5=R — position 3 is L, not A.

""RADAR"" but R at 1 and 5, position 3=D.

""SONAR"" — S O N A R? Position:1=S(out),2=O,3=N,4=A,5=R — position 3 is N, not A.

""MANOR"" — M A N O R — pos1=M,2=A,3=N,4=O,5=R — position 3=N, not A.

It's hard with R at 5 and A at 3.

""VIXEN"" but E out.

Perhaps ""MACAW"" but not with R.

Common word: think of ""OVARY"" — O V A R Y? Positions:1=O,2=V,3=A,4=R,5=Y — but that has R at position 4, but our feedback says R not at position 4? So cannot be, because we have R not at pos4.

Similarly, ""CARRY"" has C,A,R,R,Y but double R and position 3=R? Different.

Sticking with R at position 2 seems easier.

So for the guess, we can assume R at position 2, and try ""BRAND"" for example.

But we don't know for sure, so we should keep options open.

The second guess should help us narrow down.

Current constraints:
- Letter 3: A
- R is in the word, not at position 4.
- S, T, E absent.
- Possible R positions: 1,2,5

I should try a word that has R in position 1 or 2 or 5, and also test other common letters.

Since position 4 cannot be R, we can test letter for position 4.

Also, we should avoid unused letters if possible, but include common ones.

Common letters not used yet: I, O, U, L, N, C, D, M, etc.

For instance, include O, or I or L, N, etc.

Let's list candidate words for second guess.

Possible words with A at pos 3, and R somewhere not 4.

Examples:
- If R at pos 2: ""BRAND"" (B,R,A,N,D)
- ""GRAND"" (G,R,A,N,D)
- ""PRANK"" (P,R,A,N,K)
- ""CRANK"" (C,R,A,N,K) — but C and K
- ""DRAIN"" (D,R,A,I,N) — I is vowel, good

If R at pos 1: hard to find; ""RABIC"" not word; ""RAPID"" not A at 3 as above.

""MAJAR"" not word.

Assume R at pos 2 for common words.

If R at pos 5: ""TONER"" but T out, E out.
""COVER"" E out.
""MINOR"" R at 5, but position 3 N? Not A.

""SUPER"" S out.

Not easy.

So probably R is at position 2 in many cases.

For second guess, I can choose ""BRAND"" to test B, R, N, D.

R is at position 2, which might be correct or not.

But also, ""DRAIN"" has I which is a common vowel.

""DRAIN"": D,R,A,I,N — positions:1=D,2=R,3=A,4=I,5=N

Here R at position 2.

Similarly, ""BRAVO"" — B,R,A,V,O — but O is vowel.

V is less common.

Let's evaluate letters. From the first guess, we know A and R are in, so we can focus on finding their positions.

Specifically, we need to find where R is.

Since it's not at 4, and 3 is A, R must be at 1,2, or 5.

To test this, I can guess a word with R at one of these positions.

For example, if I guess a word with R at position 1, and if it gets a check or minus, I'll know.

Similarly for other positions.

But since we have A fixed at position 3, it might restrict the word.

Another idea: guess a word that has R at position 2, as in ""CRANE"" but E out.

""ORCIN"" not word.

Chose ""GRAPH"" — G,R,A,P,H — position 1=G,2=R,3=A,4=P,5=H — P and H are uncommon, but possible.

But P and H are less common; better to use common letters.

""BRAIN"" — B,R,A,I,N — this is good: B,R,A,I,N

Positions:1=B,2=R,3=A,4=I,5=N

In this guess, position 4 is I, which we can test.

Also, B, I, N are new letters.

Similarly, ""FLAIR"" but L,A,I,R — positions:1=F,2=L,3=A,4=I,5=R — but R at position 5 here, which is an option.

In ""FLAIR"", we have L and F.

But let's compare to ""BRAIN"".

I think ""BRAIN"" is a good choice: it has R at position 2 (which might be correct), A at position 3 fixed, and uses B, I, N – common letters.

If R is not at position 2, say if R is at position 1 or 5, then in this guess, 4=I,5=N, so if R is at 5, position 4 could be something else.

But we'll get feedback.

Feedback would tell if B, I, N are present, and position of R.

The word must not have E,S,T, and has A at 3, R somewhere.

So guess ""BRAIN"".

""TRAIN"" has T, which is out.

No, T is absent.

So ""BRAIN"" (B,R,A,I,N) is valid.

Other options: ""DRAIN"" (D,R,A,I,N), similar.

""GRAIN"" (G,R,A,I,N).

Any of these is fine.

I think I'll go with ""BRAIN"".

To vary letters, since in STARE we had S,T,A,R,E, now B,I,N are new.

N is common.

So my second guess: ""BRAIN"".

But let's confirm the pattern: for ""BRAIN"", position 1=B, 2=R, 3=A, 4=I, 5=N.

A at pos 3 fixed.

R at pos 2.

If the secret word has R at pos 1, for example, then in ""BRAIN"", R is at pos 2, which would show as ""-"" if R is present but not at pos 2? Feedback will show R as ""-"" for wrong position only if R is elsewhere.

But we already know R is in the word, so if we guess R at pos 2, and it's not there, it will show ""-"" and we know it's not at 2.

Similarly, if we guess a word with R at pos 1, but with A at 3.

For example, ""CRAMP"" — C,R,A,M,P — but C at 1, R at 2? No, C,R,A,M,P.

Position:1=C,2=R,3=A,4=M,5=P.

R at pos 2.

Or ""WRACK"" — W,R,A,C,K — same.

No word with R at 1 and A at 3 easily.

So I'll use ""BRAIN"" as second guess.<thinking>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""STARE"":  
- S: not in the secret word (x)  
- T: not in the secret word (x)  
- A: correct letter and position (✓), so A is the third letter.  
- R: in the secret word but wrong position (-), so R is present but not at position 4.  
- E: not in the secret word (x)  

Key insights:  
1. The secret word has A as the third letter (pattern: _ _ A _ _).  
2. R is in the word but not in position 4—possible positions are 1, 2, or 5.  
3. S, T, and E are absent—must avoid these letters.  

For the second guess:  
- Prioritize testing the position of R (likely in positions 1, 2, or 5) while keeping A fixed at position 3.  
- Include new common vowels/consonants not yet tested: focus on letters like B, I, N, L, O, etc.  
- Aim for a valid word that fits: ? ? A ? ?  

Good candidates:  
- ""BRAIN"": B R A I N  
  - Positions: B(1), R(2), A(3), I(4), N(5)  
  - Tests R at position 2, which might be correct. Introduces B, I, N—common letters.  
- ""BRAND"": B R A N D  
  - Similar, but N at position 4 and D at 5 (less vowel coverage).  
- ""DRAIN"": D R A I N  
  - Less common starting letter D.  

""BRAIN"" is selected because:  
- It tests R at position 2 (a common spot).  
- Provides information on B (new consonant), I (new vowel), and N (new consonant).  
- Fits all constraints (no S/T/E, A at position 3).  
</thinking>

<guess>BRAIN</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(✓) R(-) E(x)
Guess 2: BRAIN -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) A(✓) I(x) N(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: STARE
- S: x (not in word)
- T: x (not in word)
- A: ✓ (correct letter and position, so position 3 is A)
- R: - (in word but wrong position, so R is in the word but not at position 4)
- E: x (not in word)

Second guess: BRAIN
- B: x (not in word)
- R: ✓ (correct letter and position, so position 2 is R)
- A: ✓ (correct letter and position, so position 3 is A, which we already knew)
- I: x (not in word)
- N: - (in word but wrong position, so N is in the word but not at position 5)

Now, combining the information:

1. Position 2 is R (from second guess, R is correct at position 2)
2. Position 3 is A (from first guess, confirmed again)
3. R is in the word, but we now know it is at position 2, so the earlier feedback about R not at position 4 is consistent.
4. N is in the word but not at position 5.
5. S, T, E, B, I are not in the word.

So the secret word has:
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: A
- N is present, but not at position 5.
- No S, T, E, B, I.

The pattern so far: _ R A _ _

We need to find the first, fourth, and fifth letters.

N is in the word but not at position 5, so it must be at position 1 or 4? Positions are 1,2,3,4,5. Position 2 and 3 are taken by R and A, so N can be at position 1 or 4.

But position 4 is available, and position 1 is available.

Also, we need to avoid S, T, E, B, I.

Now, for the third guess, we should try to find a word that fits the pattern _ R A _ _ and includes N in position 1 or 4, and tests other common letters.

Since N is not at position 5, if we put N at position 4, we can test that.

Alternatively, we can put N at position 1 and see.

But we need to cover more letters.

Common letters left: O, U, L, D, C, M, P, etc.

Vowels: O, U (since A is used, and E, I are out).

Consonants: L, N, C, D, M, P, G, K, etc.

Now, the word must have N in it, at position 1 or 4.

Let's consider possibilities.

First, if N is at position 1: then word is N R A _ _

What can the last two be? And must not have S,T,E,B,I.

Examples: ""NRAIL"" not a word.

""NRAPE"" not and E out.

""DRANK"" but D is possible, but position 1 is N, not D.

N R A _ _

""CRANE"" but C and E out.

""GRAND"" but G, and D at 5? N R A ? ?

""BRAND"" but B out.

""PRANK"" P R A N K, but that has R at 2, A at 3, N at 4, K at 5. But if N is at position 4, then for N R A _ _, it would be position 1=N, 2=R, 3=A, 4=?, 5=?

So for example, ""NRAWL"" not word.

""FRAUD"" F R A U D — positions:1=F,2=R,3=A,4=U,5=D — that could be.

""GRAVY"" G R A V Y — 1=G,2=R,3=A,4=V,5=Y.

But N is not in these, but we need N in the word.

If N is at position 1, then ""NRA something"" is hard.

""CRAMP"" but C and P.

Perhaps N at position 4 is more common.

Pattern: _ R A N _

Then position 1 and 5 to fill.

With no S,T,E,B,I.

Common words: ""CRANE"" but E out.

""DRANK"" — D R A N K — positions:1=D,2=R,3=A,4=N,5=K — N at position 4.

""FRANK"" — F R A N K — similar.

""PRANK"" — P R A N K.

""TRANK"" not common.

""WRANG"" not word.

So ""DRANK"", ""FRANK"", ""PRANK"" are candidates.

But we need to avoid B and I, which we are.

In these, N is at position 4, which is consistent with the feedback that N is not at position 5.

Now, position 5 is K in these words.

But we don't know if K is in the word.

For the third guess, we can try one of these to test.

But we also need to test other letters.

Since we have _ R A _ _, and N must be at 1 or 4.

If we try a word with N at position 4, and a new letter at position 1 and 5.

For example, ""CRONY"" but C and O, and position 4 is O? Not N.

""DRONE"" E out.

""GROAN"" — G R O A N? Positions:1=G,2=R,3=O? But position 3 must be A, not O.

Pattern must have A at 3, so _ R A _ _

""GROAN"" is G,R,O,A,N — positions:1=G,2=R,3=O,4=A,5=N — but position 3 is O, not A, so invalid.

So back to _ R A N _ pattern.

Words: DRANK, FRANK, PRANK, WRACK? W R A C K — but C at 4, not N.

WRACK has no N.

So only if we have N at 4.

Other words: ""URBAN"" — U R B A N — positions:1=U,2=R,3=B? Not A, position 3 is B, not A.

""BARON"" but B out, and position 3 O? Not A.

So the common ones are DRANK, FRANK, PRANK.

Also, ""CROWN"" but position 3 O.

Not.

""BRAWN"" B out, and position 3 A? B R A W N — positions:1=B(out),2=R,3=A,4=W,5=N — but B is out, so not possible.

Similarly, ""DRAWN"" — D R A W N — positions:1=D,2=R,3=A,4=W,5=N — this could be, but W and N.

N at position 5? But feedback says N is not at position 5, so in ""DRAWN"", N is at position 5, which is invalid because N cannot be at position 5.

Feedback from BRAIN: N is in word but not at position 5, so N cannot be at position 5.

Therefore, in the secret word, N is not at position 5, so for pattern _ R A _ _, N must be at position 1 or 4.

If at position 4, then word is _ R A N _

If at position 1, then N R A _ _

But N R A _ _ words are rare, like ""NRA something"", but not common English words.

For example, ""NRAKA"" not word.

So probably N is at position 4.

Thus, pattern: _ R A N _

Now, position 1 and 5 to be filled.

Position 1: cannot be S,T,E,B,I (excluded letters), so possible: C,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z but common: C,D,F,G,K,L,M,O,P,U,W

Position 5: similarly, cannot be S,T,E,B,I, and not N (since N at 4, but N can be only once? Not necessarily, but we don't know if duplicate letters. But in feedback, for N, it was only one N in BRAIN, but secret could have multiple. However, we don't have information, so assume no duplicate for now.

Common words with pattern _ R A N _:

- DRANK: D R A N K
- FRANK: F R A N K
- PRANK: P R A N K
- CRANK: C R A N K
- WRANK not word
- GRAND: but that has D at 5, but N at 4? GRAND is G,R,A,N,D so position 4=N, 5=D.

GRAND is possible.

Similarly, BRAND but B out.

So possible: CRANK, DRANK, FRANK, PRANK, GRAND.

GRAND has G at 1, R at 2, A at 3, N at 4, D at 5.

In DRANK, D at 1, K at 5.

Etc.

For the third guess, we can choose one that tests new letters.

For example, ""CRANK"" has C and K.

""PRANK"" has P and K.

""GRAND"" has G and D.

Since we need to find position 1 and 5, we can choose a word that uses common letters.

Also, we might want to test if K is present, or D, etc.

Another idea: since we have limited guesses, we can choose a word that has multiple possibilities.

But we have 4 guesses left, so we can test.

Perhaps ""CRANK"" to test C and K.

But let's see the feedback.

We also have to consider that the word must be valid.

Another common word: ""URBAN"" but position 3 is B, not A.

Not.

""ORGAN"" O R G A N — positions:1=O,2=R,3=G? Not A, position 3 is G, not A.

So not.

So the main candidates are CRANK, DRANK, FRANK, PRANK, GRAND.

Now, from second guess, we have N not at 5, which is satisfied if N at 4.

In GRAND, N is at 4, D at 5.

In DRANK, N at 4, K at 5.

Etc.

For the third guess, I can pick ""FRANK"" for example.

But let's think about what letters we haven't tested.

We have tested: S,T,A,R,E,B,I,N

A and R are in, N is in.

Excluded: S,T,E,B,I

Not tested: C,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Common: C,D,F,G,K,L,M,O,P,U,W

In ""FRANK"": F,R,A,N,K

F and K are new.

Similarly, ""PRANK"": P,R,A,N,K

P and K.

""CRANK"": C,R,A,N,K

C and K.

""GRAND"": G,R,A,N,D

G and D.

""DRANK"": D,R,A,N,K

D and K.

To maximize information, we might want to include a vowel, like O or U.

But in the pattern _ R A N _, position 5 is a consonant in these words.

For example, ""GROAN"" but position 3 not A.

Not possible.

""WRUNG"" not pattern.

So no vowel at position 5 easily.

Position 1 could be a vowel, like U, but ""URBAN"" not.

""ORANT"" not word.

So probably not.

Therefore, I'll go with ""CRANK"" to test C and K.

But C and K are less common than D or G.

""GRAND"" has G and D, which are more common.

G is more common than C or K.

Letter frequencies: E,A,R,I,O,T,N,S,L,C,... so C is common, D is common, G less so.

D is more common than G.

In English, E,A,R,I,O,T,N,S,L,C,U,D,P,M...

D is about 4.3%, P is about 2%, C is 2.7%, K is 0.8%, etc.

But for Wordle, it might vary.

Since we have N at position 4, and we need position 1 and 5.

If I guess ""GRAND"", for example, and if it's not correct, we get feedback on G and D.

Similarly for others.

But we can choose a word that doesn't necessarily have N at 4, to test if N is at position 1.

For example, guess a word with N at position 1: N R A ? ?

But what word? ""NRA something"" — ""NRAIL"" not, ""NRAKE"" not, ""NRAGE"" not, ""DRAIN"" but D R A I N, but I is out, and position 4 I is x, so not.

""TRAIN"" T out.

""GRAIN"" G R A I N, but I out.

So no common word with N at position 1 and A at 3.

Therefore, N must be at position 4.

So pattern is _ R A N _

Now, for the third guess, I'll choose ""DRANK"" to test D and K.

""DRANK"": D R A N K

Positions:1=D,2=R,3=A,4=N,5=K

If D is correct, it will show ✓, similarly for K.

If not, we know.

But we have other options.

Since we have multiple possibilities, we can choose a word that covers more common letters.

Another idea: guess a word that has O or U, but in this pattern, it's hard.

For example, ""CROWN"" not.

""BROWN"" B out.

Not.

So I think ""DRANK"" is fine.

But let's list all possible words to see.

Possible secret words: from Wordle word list, but I don't have it, so common words.

CRANK, DRANK, FRANK, PRANK, GRAND.

Also, ""WRANG"" not.

""TRANS"" T out.

""BRING"" B out, and position 3 I? Not A.

So about 5 possibilities: CRANK, DRANK, FRANK, PRANK, GRAND.

GRAND has D at 5, while others have K at 5 except GRAND.

In GRAND, position 5 is D, in others K.

For the third guess, we can guess one of them to narrow down.

Since we have 4 guesses left, it's ok.

But to be efficient, we can guess a word that tests multiple.

For example, if I guess ""CRANK"", and if it's not correct, we get feedback on C and K.

Similarly.

But let's see what the feedback can tell us.

Perhaps guess a word that is not necessarily possible, but tests letters.

For example, guess ""CROWN"" but position 3 not A.

Not possible because position 3 must be A.

All guesses must have A at position 3 and R at position 2, because we know R is at position 2.

From second guess, R is at position 2, so it must be in the secret word at position 2.

So all future guesses must have R at position 2 and A at position 3.

So pattern: ? R A ? ?

And N is in the word, not at position 5, so at position 1 or 4.

But position 1 and 4 are available.

For the guess, we can have N at position 1 or 4 or not, but we know N is in the word.

In the third guess, we can put N at position 4 to test.

Or at position 1.

But position 1 with N is hard, so put at position 4.

So guess a word with pattern ? R A N ?

Then position 1 and 5 to be guessed.

For example, ""CRANK"" or ""DRANK"" etc.

I think I'll go with ""GRAND"" to test G and D.

""GRAND"": G R A N D

Then if G is correct, position 1 is G, and D at 5.

If not, we know.

Similarly.

But let's choose.

Since K is common in many, perhaps guess ""PRANK"" to test P and K.

But P and K are less common.

""FRANK"" has F, which is less common.

""CRANK"" has C, which is common.

C is more common.

But in ""CRANK"", position 5 is K.

""GRAND"" has G and D, both common.

D is more common than K.

So ""GRAND"" might be better.

Also, ""DRANK"" has D and K, D common, K less.

But ""GRAND"" has G and D.

I think ""GRAND"" is a good choice.

So third guess: ""GRAND""

But let's confirm the pattern: G R A N D

Position 1: G, 2: R, 3: A, 4: N, 5: D

Now, feedback will tell us about G, N, and D.

We know R and A are correct.

N is in the word, but not at position 5, here it is at position 4, so if N is at position 4 in secret, it might be correct or not, but we know N is present.

If position 4 is N in secret, then it will be ✓ for N.

If not, then N is at position 1, and position 4 is something else.

But we'll see.

I think it's fine.

So I'll go with ""GRAND"".### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Feedback from Previous Guesses:**
   - **Guess 1: STARE** → Feedback: S(x) T(x) A(✓) R(-) E(x)
     - A is correct and in position 3.
     - R is in the word but not in position 4.
     - S, T, E are absent.
   - **Guess 2: BRAIN** → Feedback: B(x) R(✓) A(✓) I(x) N(-)
     - R is correct and in position 2 (confirming position 2 is R).
     - A is correct and in position 3 (redundant but consistent).
     - N is in the word but not in position 5.
     - B and I are absent.

2. **Key Insights:**
   - **Positions confirmed:**
     - Position 2: R
     - Position 3: A
     - Pattern so far: `_ R A _ _`
   - **Letters present but position unknown:**
     - N is in the word, but not at position 5. Since positions 2 and 3 are fixed, N must be at position 1 or 4.
   - **Absent letters:** S, T, E, B, I (cannot be used).
   - **Possible positions for N:**
     - If N is at position 1, the pattern is `N R A _ _`.
     - If N is at position 4, the pattern is `_ R A N _`.
     - Common English words with `N R A _ _` are rare (e.g., ""NRA"" words are uncommon). Thus, N is more likely at position 4, leading to the pattern `_ R A N _`.
   - **Remaining positions to solve:** Position 1 and position 5.
     - Position 1: Must be a letter not in {S, T, E, B, I}. Common options: C, D, F, G, K, L, M, O, P, U, W.
     - Position 5: Must be a letter not in {S, T, E, B, I, N} (since N is not at position 5). Common options: D, K, L, M, O, P, Y.

3. **Strategy for Third Guess:**
   - Test the pattern `_ R A N _` to verify N at position 4 and gather info on positions 1 and 5.
   - Prioritize common letters for positions 1 and 5 to maximize information (e.g., D, G, K, P).
   - Avoid absent letters (S, T, E, B, I).
   - **Candidate words:** CRANK, DRANK, FRANK, PRANK, GRAND.
     - ""GRAND"" is chosen because:
       - Uses G (position 1) and D (position 5), both common letters not yet tested.
       - If correct, it solves the word. If not, feedback on G and D will narrow possibilities (e.g., if G is absent, position 1 is likely C, F, P, etc.; if D is absent, position 5 is likely K or another letter).
       - Fits the pattern `_ R A N _` directly, testing N at position 4.

Guess 2: BRAIN -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) A(✓) I(x) N(-)
Guess 3: GRAND -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(✓) D(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: STARE
- S: x (not in word)
- T: x (not in word)
- A: ✓ (correct letter and position, position 3)
- R: - (in word but wrong position, not at position 4)
- E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: BRAIN
- B: x (not in word)
- R: ✓ (correct letter and position, position 2)
- A: ✓ (correct letter and position, position 3)
- I: x (not in word)
- N: - (in word but wrong position, not at position 5)

Guess 3: GRAND
- G: x (not in word)
- R: ✓ (correct letter and position, position 2)
- A: ✓ (correct letter and position, position 3)
- N: ✓ (correct letter and position, position 4)
- D: x (not in word)

Now, combining all information:

1. Positions:
   - Position 2: R (confirmed by guess 2 and 3)
   - Position 3: A (confirmed)
   - Position 4: N (confirmed by guess 3)
   - Position 1: unknown, but not S,T,E,B,I,G (excluded)
   - Position 5: unknown, but not S,T,E,B,I,N? From guess 2, N not at position 5, but now we know N is at position 4. Also D is out.

2. Letters not in word: S,T,E,B,I,G,D
   - So excluded: S,T,E,B,I,G,D

3. Known letters in word: R,A,N
   - R at position 2, A at 3, N at 4.

4. Pattern: _ R A N _

5. Position 1 and 5 to be found.

6. Excluded letters: S,T,E,B,I,G,D

7. Possible letters for position 1: anything except S,T,E,B,I,G,D and must be English letters.

8. Position 5: similarly, except also N is used but position 5 could be other letter, even duplicate? But no duplicate indication, so assume single letters.

9. We know N is only at position 4.

10. We need to find position 1 and 5.

11. Common remaining letters: C,F,H,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

12. Since we have to form a word, possible words: pattern ? R A N ?

Examples:
- C R A N K
- F R A N K
- P R A N K
- Also, W R A N K? But W,R,A,N,K — WRANK not word?
Common words: CRANK, FRANK, PRANK

Also, ""URAN"" not 5 letters.

""ORANG"" not English.

""IRANI"" I out, and not pattern.

So likely CRANK, FRANK, PRANK.

In GRAND, D was guessed and not in word, so position 5 not D.

Similarly, in BRAIN, B and I out.

From the pattern, only possibilities are CRANK, FRANK, PRANK.

For fourth guess, we need to choose among these or another word that fits and tests the possibilities.

But since we have only three options, we can guess one.

For example, guess ""CRANK"" – if not, then we know.

Similarly.

To choose, ""FRANK"" has F which is less common, ""PRANK"" has P, ""CRANK"" has C.

C is most common among F,P,C.

But let's see letter frequencies: C is common, F less, P similar.

Perhaps guess ""CRANK"" first.

But all are almost equally likely.

Since we have a only a few, we can guess ""CRANK"".

If it's not ""CRANK"", we have two left, and three guesses.

But we can be efficient.

Another possibility: ""WRUNG"" not the pattern.

I think CRANK, FRANK, PRANK are the main ones.

So for this guess, I'll choose ""CRANK"".

So fourth guess: ""CRANK""

Pattern: C R A N K

If correct, done.

If not, we get feedback.### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Review previous feedback:**
   - **Guess 1 (STARE):** S(x), T(x), A(✓) in position 3, R(-) present but not position 4, E(x) → Reveals:
     - Secret word contains A (position 3) and R (not position 4).
     - S, T, E are absent.
   - **Guess 2 (BRAIN):** B(x), R(✓) in position 2, A(✓) in position 3, I(x), N(-) present but not position 5 → Reveals:
     - Confirms R (position 2) and A (position 3).
     - N is present but not in position 5.
     - B and I are absent.
   - **Guess 3 (GRAND):** G(x), R(✓) in position 2, A(✓) in position 3, N(✓) in position 4, D(x) → Reveals:
     - Confirms R (position 2), A (position 3), and N (position 4).
     - G and D are absent.

2. **Consolidate known information:**
   - **Secret word pattern:** Positions:
     - Position 2: R
     - Position 3: A
     - Position 4: N
     - Position 1: Unknown (cannot be S, T, E, B, I, G, D)
     - Position 5: Unknown (cannot be S, T, E, B, I, G, D, and not N due to position 4)
     - Thus, pattern is `_ R A N _`.
   - **Absent letters:** S, T, E, B, I, G, D (must exclude these).
   - **Remaining possibilities:** Only valid English words fitting `_ R A N _` with absent letters excluded are:
     - CRANK (C in position 1, K in position 5)
     - FRANK (F in position 1, K in position 5)
     - PRANK (P in position 1, K in position 5)
     - Other words (like WRANK) are invalid/not English.

3. **Strategy for fourth guess:**
   - Test one of the three candidates (CRANK, FRANK, PRANK) to resolve position 1 and 5.
   - Prioritize **CRANK** because:
     - C is a common starting letter (high frequency in English).
     - Tests K in position 5—if correct, solves the word; if not, eliminates C and K (narrowing to FRANK or PRANK).
     - Balances efficiency: With 3 guesses left, testing CRANK first maximizes information if incorrect (e.g., if C/K absent, FRANK or PRANK is likely).

4. **Conclusion:** Guess **CRANK** to confirm/discard C and K while covering the pattern.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information I get. That means picking a word with common letters to cover as many possibilities as possible.\n\nI recall that in Wordle, common starting words include words with frequent vowels and consonants. Letters like E, A, R, S, T are very common in English words. So, I should choose a word that includes several of these.\n\nSome popular starting words are ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", ""TRACE"", etc. These cover multiple vowels and common consonants.\n\nLet me think about the vowels: A, E, I, O, U are vowels, and I should try to include at least one or two. Consonants like R, S, T, N, L are also frequent.\n\nFor example, ""ROAST"" has R, O, A, S, T – that\'s good because it includes two vowels (O and A) and common consonants.\n\n""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E – R, A, E are common.\n\n""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E.\n\n""SALET"" is another one, but it\'s less common.\n\nI want a word that is all unique letters to cover more ground. Duplicate letters would give less information.\n\nLet me list possible first guesses: I can start with ""CRANE"".\n\nWhy ""CRANE""? It has C, R, A, N, E. C is not as common as S or T, but E, A, R are very frequent. R is a common consonant, E is the most common vowel, A is also common.\n\nAlternatives: ""RAISE"" has R,A,I,S,E – lots of vowels and common consonants.\n\n""IRATE"" – I,R,A,T,E.\n\nBut perhaps ""CRANE"" is a solid choice.\n\nSince the feedback will tell me which letters are in the word and their positions, I should try to cover different positions.\n\nBut for the first guess, position isn\'t as critical because I don\'t have any information.\n\nI think ""CRANE"" is a balanced choice.\n\nAnother common one is ""ADIEU"" which has many vowels – A,D,I,E,U. That might be good for vowel coverage, but consonants are important too.\n\n""SLATE"" seems better: S,L,A,T,E – S and T are very common consonants.\n\nS, L, A, T, E – L is common but not as frequent as S or T.\n\nLet me check letter frequencies in English.\n\nAccording to data, the most common letters in 5-letter words are: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, etc.\n\nSpecifically for Wordle, from past games, E, S, A, O, R, I, L, T are top letters.\n\nSo, a word with S, E, A, R, T might be ideal.\n\n""STARE"" – S,T,A,R,E – that includes S, T, A, R, E – all highly common letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""ROAST"" was R,O,A,S,T – O instead of E.\n\nE is more frequent than O, so ""STARE"" might be slightly better.\n\n""CRANE"" has C and N, which are less common.\n\nI should go with ""STARE"".\n\nBut ""SLATE"" is S,L,A,T,E – L is slightly less common than R.\n\n""STARE"" has R, which is good.\n\nAnother popular one is ""CRATE"" – C,R,A,T,E – C is less common.\n\n""RAISE"" – R,A,I,S,E – I is common.\n\nTo maximize, perhaps ""STARE"" or ""SALET"".\n\nI think ""STARE"" is a good choice for first guess.\n\nBut let me confirm: S, T, A, R, E – position-wise, S and E are often at ends, but it\'s fine.\n\nSince I have to output in the format, I\'ll go with ""STARE"".\n\nThe response format requires me to think step by step, then output the guess.\n\nSo for my thought process: I should choose a starting word that includes common letters to gather as much feedback as possible. The letters S, T, A, R, and E are among the most frequent in English words, so ""STARE"" is an effective first guess. It will help identify correct letters and positions, or at least presence/absence, which can guide subsequent guesses.\n\nI think that\'s reasonable.<thinking>\nFor the first guess in Wordle, it\'s best to choose a word that includes a variety of common vowels and consonants to maximize information from the feedback. Common starting words often use letters like E, A, R, S, T, L, which appear frequently in English words. After considering several options like ""CRANE"" (C, R, A, N, E), ""ROAST"" (R, O, A, S, T), and ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E), I selected ""STARE"" as it includes S, T, A, R, E—all highly common letters. This choice covers multiple vowels (A and E) and high-frequency consonants (S, T, R), increasing the likelihood of identifying letters in the secret word. Since the letters are all unique, it avoids redundancy and provides more useful feedback on letter presence and position.\n</thinking>\n\n<guess>STARE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(✓) R(-) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from the first guess ""STARE"":\n- S: x (not in the word)\n- T: x (not in the word)\n- A: ✓ (correct letter and correct position, so A is the third letter)\n- R: - (in the word but wrong position; since position is wrong and it was fourth, R is in the word but not at position 4)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nFrom this, we know:\n- The secret word contains an \'A\' as the third letter.\n- It also contains an \'R\', but not as the fourth letter (since position is wrong).\n- Letters S, T, E are not in the word at all.\n\nWe need to make a second guess that is a 5-letter word with:\n- \'A\' in the third position (because A is confirmed there).\n- Must include \'R\' somewhere, but not in the fourth position.\n- Should not include S, T, E.\n- We can include other common letters to test more possibilities.\n\nGiven that S, T, E are out, we have to choose from other letters.\n\nWe also need to consider that R is in the word but not in position 4. Possible positions for R: since the word has positions 1,2,3,4,5 and we know position 3 is A, so R cannot be at 3. Possible positions: 1,2,4,5? But position 4 is excluded from the feedback? Wait no: the feedback for R is ""-"", meaning present but not at position 4. So R could be at position 1,2, or 5? But we don\'t know yet.\n\nPositions: \n1: unknown\n2: unknown\n3: A\n4: unknown, but cannot be R? Actually, from feedback, R is not at 4, but it could be at 1,2, or 5.\nPosition 5 is possible.\n\nAlso, S, T, E are absent, so we avoid those.\n\nWhat common letters can we use? We might want to test other vowels and consonants.\n\nOther vowels: we have O, I, U, Y sometimes, but in this case E is out.\n\nConsonants: common ones like L, N, C, D, etc.\n\nSince we need to place R somewhere, we can try R in position 1 or 2 or 5.\n\nLet me think of words that have ""A"" in the third position.\n\nThe pattern is: ? ? A ? ?\n\nAnd one of the other positions must include R.\n\nAlso, no S, T, E.\n\nFor example:\n- If R is at position 1: R ? A ? ?\n- If R is at position 2: ? R A ? ?\n- If R is at position 5: ? ? A ? R\n\nAlso, we might want to use common letters for the other positions to test.\n\nCommon letters not excluded: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But for Wordle, we need likely letters.\n\nPerhaps include O or I, L, N, etc.\n\nLet me brainstorm words:\n\nFirst, suppose R is at position 1: R ? A ? ?\n\nPossible words: ROUND? But O U N D—position 3 is A, not O. Must be A at 3.\n\nSo: R _ A _ _\n\nExamples: RABID (R A B I D — but position 3 is A? R A B I D: position1=R, pos2=A? No, we need pos3 to be A. Here pos2 is A, not pos3.\n\nWord structure: letter1, letter2, A, letter4, letter5.\n\nFor R at pos1: R ? A ? ?\n\nLike: RADAR? But R A D A R — but we have A at pos2 and pos4? But we need only pos3 known so far, but in RADAR, A is also at pos2 and pos4? But that could be.\n\nBut RADAR would have two As? Not necessarily a problem.\n\nBut position 3 is D in RADAR? R-A-D-A-R, so position 3 is D, but we need position 3 to be A? I think I\'m confusing.\n\nR A D A R:\nPos1: R, pos2: A, pos3: D, pos4: A, pos5: R.\n\nBut we need position 3 to be A, so that won\'t work.\n\nFor R in pos1, the word must have pos3=A, so letter1=R, letter2=?, letter3=A, letter4=?, letter5=?\n\nSo examples: REALM? But E is out, we cannot use E.\n\nAlso, R is used, but that\'s fine.\n\nPossible words: \n- RICAN? Not a word.\n- RACED? E is out.\n- RABID: pos: R, A, B, I, D? But pos2 is A, not pos3. We need pos2 to be something, and pos3=A.\n\nFor R at pos1: R letter2 A letter4 letter5.\n\nLetter3 is A, that\'s fixed.\n\nWords: ROYAL — R O Y A L? But that would be pos1=R, pos2=O, pos3=Y, pos4=A, pos5=L? No, we need pos3=A, not Y.\n\nI think I\'m messing up positions.\n\nThe word should be: position 1: R (or whatever), position 2: ?, position 3: A, position 4: ?, position 5: ?\n\nSo for R at position 1: R (1), ? (2), A (3), ? (4), ? (5)\n\nWords like: ""RAPID"" — R,A,P,I,D — positions: 1:R, 2:A, 3:P? That\'s not A at3.\n\nStandard: in ""RAPID"", positions: 1=R, 2=A, 3=P, 4=I, 5=D. So position 3 is P, not A.\n\nTo have position 3=A, the word must have A as the third letter.\n\nFor example: ""CRAWL"" — C,R,A,W,L — positions:1=C,2=R,3=A,4=W,5=L. Here pos3=A.\n\nSimilarly, ""BRAWL"" — B,R,A,W,L — same pattern? B R A W L: 1=B,2=R,3=A,4=W,5=L.\n\nBut R is in the word, and in this case at position 2.\n\nBack to R at position 1.\n\nWhat word has first letter R and third letter A: so pattern R ? A ? ?\n\nExamples: ""RADIO"" — R,A,D,I,O — but positions:1=R,2=A,3=D — again pos3 is D, not A.\n\nI need words where the third letter is A.\n\n""MANIA"" is M,A,N,I,A — pos3=N? Not A.\n\nActually, common words: like ""PLANT"" but P,L,A,N,T — here A is position 3.\n\nPLANT: letters P,L,A,N,T — pos1=P,2=L,3=A,4=N,5=T.\n\nSimilarly, ""GRANT"" — G,R,A,N,T — 1=G,2=R,3=A,4=N,5=T.\n\nIn ""GRANT"", we have R at position 2.\n\nFor R at position 1, what about ""RAVEN""? But E is out.\n\n""RALPH"" not common.\n\nPerhaps ""RAMIN""? Not English.\n\n""OASIS"" but O,A,S,I,S — pos3=S? No.\n\nList words with A as third letter.\n\nFrom memory: BLAND, BRAND, CRAMP, etc.\n\nBut for R at position 1: ""RARER""? R,A,R,E,R — but E is out, and A is position 2.\n\n""RAPER"" has E.\n\n""RAZER"" not word.\n\nIt\'s hard to find with R at 1 and A at 3.\n\n""RAYON"" — R,A,Y,O,N? Positions:1=R,2=A,3=Y — not A.\n\nPerhaps I should look for words where R is in another position.\n\nSince R is not at position 4, and position 3 is A, R could be at 1,2, or 5.\n\nPosition 4 is unknown, but cannot be R because R is not at 4 based on feedback? Feedback for position 4 of STARE was R but wrong position, so R is not at position 4 for the secret word.\n\nSimilarly, position 1 cannot be S, position 2 cannot be T? No, feedback says S was at position 1 of guess and x, meaning no S at all. Similarly T at position 2 of guess and x, meaning T not in word. E not in word.\n\nSo secret word: no S, T, E, and has A at position 3, R somewhere not at position 4.\n\nPossible positions for R: 1,2,5.\n\nSince position 4 cannot be R, and position 3 is A, so R at 1,2,5.\n\nNow for second guess, we want to test R in a specific position as well as introduce new letters.\n\nAlso, since we have limited tries, we should cover more common letters.\n\nLet\'s consider positions.\n\nCase 1: R at position 1.\nThen word: R ? A ? ? \n\nWhat words? Like ""RIVAL"" — R,I,V,A,L — but position 3 is V, not A. \n""ROYAL"" — R,O,Y,A,L — positions:1=R,2=O,3=Y?! No.\n\n""RUMBA""? R,U,M,B,A — positions:1=R,2=U,3=M,4=B,5=A — position 5 is A, not 3.\n\nI think I give up on R at 1 for now; it\'s rare.\n\nCase 2: R at position 2.\nThen word: ? R A ? ?\n\nExamples: CRANE — but C,R,A,N,E — E is out.\nPLANE — P,L,A,N,E — E out.\nGRAPE — G,R,A,P,E — E out.\nBRAVE — B,R,A,V,E — E out.\nDRAKE — D,R,A,K,E — E out.\n\nAll end with E issue.\n\n""CRACK"" — C,R,A,C,K — but C and K, and double C? Not good.\n\n""DRAMA"" — D,R,A,M,A — positions:1=D,2=R,3=A,4=M,5=A — possible, but A at pos5 too? We don\'t know.\n\n""BRAND"" — B,R,A,N,D — positions:1=B,2=R,3=A,4=N,5=D — good.\n\n""A"" at position 3, R at position 2.\n\nSimilarly, ""GRAND"" — G,R,A,N,D.\n\n""PRANK"" — P,R,A,N,K.\n\nSo possible words: BRAND, GRAND, PRANK, etc.\n\nBut S,T,E absent, so ""BRAND"" has B,R,A,N,D.\n\nCase 3: R at position 5.\nThen word: ? ? A ? R\n\nExamples: ""SUGAR"" but S out, E not used but S out.\n""NOVAR"" not word.\n""LUNAR"" — L,U,N,A,R? Positions:1=L,2=U,3=N? Not A.\nWe need position 3=A.\n\nSo for R at 5: ? ? A ? R\n\n""POLAR"" — P,O,L,A,R — positions:1=P,2=O,3=L,4=A,5=R — position 3 is L, not A.\n\n""RADAR"" but R at 1 and 5, position 3=D.\n\n""SONAR"" — S O N A R? Position:1=S(out),2=O,3=N,4=A,5=R — position 3 is N, not A.\n\n""MANOR"" — M A N O R — pos1=M,2=A,3=N,4=O,5=R — position 3=N, not A.\n\nIt\'s hard with R at 5 and A at 3.\n\n""VIXEN"" but E out.\n\nPerhaps ""MACAW"" but not with R.\n\nCommon word: think of ""OVARY"" — O V A R Y? Positions:1=O,2=V,3=A,4=R,5=Y — but that has R at position 4, but our feedback says R not at position 4? So cannot be, because we have R not at pos4.\n\nSimilarly, ""CARRY"" has C,A,R,R,Y but double R and position 3=R? Different.\n\nSticking with R at position 2 seems easier.\n\nSo for the guess, we can assume R at position 2, and try ""BRAND"" for example.\n\nBut we don\'t know for sure, so we should keep options open.\n\nThe second guess should help us narrow down.\n\nCurrent constraints:\n- Letter 3: A\n- R is in the word, not at position 4.\n- S, T, E absent.\n- Possible R positions: 1,2,5\n\nI should try a word that has R in position 1 or 2 or 5, and also test other common letters.\n\nSince position 4 cannot be R, we can test letter for position 4.\n\nAlso, we should avoid unused letters if possible, but include common ones.\n\nCommon letters not used yet: I, O, U, L, N, C, D, M, etc.\n\nFor instance, include O, or I or L, N, etc.\n\nLet\'s list candidate words for second guess.\n\nPossible words with A at pos 3, and R somewhere not 4.\n\nExamples:\n- If R at pos 2: ""BRAND"" (B,R,A,N,D)\n- ""GRAND"" (G,R,A,N,D)\n- ""PRANK"" (P,R,A,N,K)\n- ""CRANK"" (C,R,A,N,K) — but C and K\n- ""DRAIN"" (D,R,A,I,N) — I is vowel, good\n\nIf R at pos 1: hard to find; ""RABIC"" not word; ""RAPID"" not A at 3 as above.\n\n""MAJAR"" not word.\n\nAssume R at pos 2 for common words.\n\nIf R at pos 5: ""TONER"" but T out, E out.\n""COVER"" E out.\n""MINOR"" R at 5, but position 3 N? Not A.\n\n""SUPER"" S out.\n\nNot easy.\n\nSo probably R is at position 2 in many cases.\n\nFor second guess, I can choose ""BRAND"" to test B, R, N, D.\n\nR is at position 2, which might be correct or not.\n\nBut also, ""DRAIN"" has I which is a common vowel.\n\n""DRAIN"": D,R,A,I,N — positions:1=D,2=R,3=A,4=I,5=N\n\nHere R at position 2.\n\nSimilarly, ""BRAVO"" — B,R,A,V,O — but O is vowel.\n\nV is less common.\n\nLet\'s evaluate letters. From the first guess, we know A and R are in, so we can focus on finding their positions.\n\nSpecifically, we need to find where R is.\n\nSince it\'s not at 4, and 3 is A, R must be at 1,2, or 5.\n\nTo test this, I can guess a word with R at one of these positions.\n\nFor example, if I guess a word with R at position 1, and if it gets a check or minus, I\'ll know.\n\nSimilarly for other positions.\n\nBut since we have A fixed at position 3, it might restrict the word.\n\nAnother idea: guess a word that has R at position 2, as in ""CRANE"" but E out.\n\n""ORCIN"" not word.\n\nChose ""GRAPH"" — G,R,A,P,H — position 1=G,2=R,3=A,4=P,5=H — P and H are uncommon, but possible.\n\nBut P and H are less common; better to use common letters.\n\n""BRAIN"" — B,R,A,I,N — this is good: B,R,A,I,N\n\nPositions:1=B,2=R,3=A,4=I,5=N\n\nIn this guess, position 4 is I, which we can test.\n\nAlso, B, I, N are new letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""FLAIR"" but L,A,I,R — positions:1=F,2=L,3=A,4=I,5=R — but R at position 5 here, which is an option.\n\nIn ""FLAIR"", we have L and F.\n\nBut let\'s compare to ""BRAIN"".\n\nI think ""BRAIN"" is a good choice: it has R at position 2 (which might be correct), A at position 3 fixed, and uses B, I, N – common letters.\n\nIf R is not at position 2, say if R is at position 1 or 5, then in this guess, 4=I,5=N, so if R is at 5, position 4 could be something else.\n\nBut we\'ll get feedback.\n\nFeedback would tell if B, I, N are present, and position of R.\n\nThe word must not have E,S,T, and has A at 3, R somewhere.\n\nSo guess ""BRAIN"".\n\n""TRAIN"" has T, which is out.\n\nNo, T is absent.\n\nSo ""BRAIN"" (B,R,A,I,N) is valid.\n\nOther options: ""DRAIN"" (D,R,A,I,N), similar.\n\n""GRAIN"" (G,R,A,I,N).\n\nAny of these is fine.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""BRAIN"".\n\nTo vary letters, since in STARE we had S,T,A,R,E, now B,I,N are new.\n\nN is common.\n\nSo my second guess: ""BRAIN"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm the pattern: for ""BRAIN"", position 1=B, 2=R, 3=A, 4=I, 5=N.\n\nA at pos 3 fixed.\n\nR at pos 2.\n\nIf the secret word has R at pos 1, for example, then in ""BRAIN"", R is at pos 2, which would show as ""-"" if R is present but not at pos 2? Feedback will show R as ""-"" for wrong position only if R is elsewhere.\n\nBut we already know R is in the word, so if we guess R at pos 2, and it\'s not there, it will show ""-"" and we know it\'s not at 2.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess a word with R at pos 1, but with A at 3.\n\nFor example, ""CRAMP"" — C,R,A,M,P — but C at 1, R at 2? No, C,R,A,M,P.\n\nPosition:1=C,2=R,3=A,4=M,5=P.\n\nR at pos 2.\n\nOr ""WRACK"" — W,R,A,C,K — same.\n\nNo word with R at 1 and A at 3 easily.\n\nSo I\'ll use ""BRAIN"" as second guess.<thinking>\nBased on the feedback from the first guess ""STARE"":  \n- S: not in the secret word (x)  \n- T: not in the secret word (x)  \n- A: correct letter and position (✓), so A is the third letter.  \n- R: in the secret word but wrong position (-), so R is present but not at position 4.  \n- E: not in the secret word (x)  \n\nKey insights:  \n1. The secret word has A as the third letter (pattern: _ _ A _ _).  \n2. R is in the word but not in position 4—possible positions are 1, 2, or 5.  \n3. S, T, and E are absent—must avoid these letters.  \n\nFor the second guess:  \n- Prioritize testing the position of R (likely in positions 1, 2, or 5) while keeping A fixed at position 3.  \n- Include new common vowels/consonants not yet tested: focus on letters like B, I, N, L, O, etc.  \n- Aim for a valid word that fits: ? ? A ? ?  \n\nGood candidates:  \n- ""BRAIN"": B R A I N  \n  - Positions: B(1), R(2), A(3), I(4), N(5)  \n  - Tests R at position 2, which might be correct. Introduces B, I, N—common letters.  \n- ""BRAND"": B R A N D  \n  - Similar, but N at position 4 and D at 5 (less vowel coverage).  \n- ""DRAIN"": D R A I N  \n  - Less common starting letter D.  \n\n""BRAIN"" is selected because:  \n- It tests R at position 2 (a common spot).  \n- Provides information on B (new consonant), I (new vowel), and N (new consonant).  \n- Fits all constraints (no S/T/E, A at position 3).  \n</thinking>\n\n<guess>BRAIN</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(✓) R(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: BRAIN -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) A(✓) I(x) N(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nFirst guess: STARE\n- S: x (not in word)\n- T: x (not in word)\n- A: ✓ (correct letter and position, so position 3 is A)\n- R: - (in word but wrong position, so R is in the word but not at position 4)\n- E: x (not in word)\n\nSecond guess: BRAIN\n- B: x (not in word)\n- R: ✓ (correct letter and position, so position 2 is R)\n- A: ✓ (correct letter and position, so position 3 is A, which we already knew)\n- I: x (not in word)\n- N: - (in word but wrong position, so N is in the word but not at position 5)\n\nNow, combining the information:\n\n1. Position 2 is R (from second guess, R is correct at position 2)\n2. Position 3 is A (from first guess, confirmed again)\n3. R is in the word, but we now know it is at position 2, so the earlier feedback about R not at position 4 is consistent.\n4. N is in the word but not at position 5.\n5. S, T, E, B, I are not in the word.\n\nSo the secret word has:\n- Position 2: R\n- Position 3: A\n- N is present, but not at position 5.\n- No S, T, E, B, I.\n\nThe pattern so far: _ R A _ _\n\nWe need to find the first, fourth, and fifth letters.\n\nN is in the word but not at position 5, so it must be at position 1 or 4? Positions are 1,2,3,4,5. Position 2 and 3 are taken by R and A, so N can be at position 1 or 4.\n\nBut position 4 is available, and position 1 is available.\n\nAlso, we need to avoid S, T, E, B, I.\n\nNow, for the third guess, we should try to find a word that fits the pattern _ R A _ _ and includes N in position 1 or 4, and tests other common letters.\n\nSince N is not at position 5, if we put N at position 4, we can test that.\n\nAlternatively, we can put N at position 1 and see.\n\nBut we need to cover more letters.\n\nCommon letters left: O, U, L, D, C, M, P, etc.\n\nVowels: O, U (since A is used, and E, I are out).\n\nConsonants: L, N, C, D, M, P, G, K, etc.\n\nNow, the word must have N in it, at position 1 or 4.\n\nLet\'s consider possibilities.\n\nFirst, if N is at position 1: then word is N R A _ _\n\nWhat can the last two be? And must not have S,T,E,B,I.\n\nExamples: ""NRAIL"" not a word.\n\n""NRAPE"" not and E out.\n\n""DRANK"" but D is possible, but position 1 is N, not D.\n\nN R A _ _\n\n""CRANE"" but C and E out.\n\n""GRAND"" but G, and D at 5? N R A ? ?\n\n""BRAND"" but B out.\n\n""PRANK"" P R A N K, but that has R at 2, A at 3, N at 4, K at 5. But if N is at position 4, then for N R A _ _, it would be position 1=N, 2=R, 3=A, 4=?, 5=?\n\nSo for example, ""NRAWL"" not word.\n\n""FRAUD"" F R A U D — positions:1=F,2=R,3=A,4=U,5=D — that could be.\n\n""GRAVY"" G R A V Y — 1=G,2=R,3=A,4=V,5=Y.\n\nBut N is not in these, but we need N in the word.\n\nIf N is at position 1, then ""NRA something"" is hard.\n\n""CRAMP"" but C and P.\n\nPerhaps N at position 4 is more common.\n\nPattern: _ R A N _\n\nThen position 1 and 5 to fill.\n\nWith no S,T,E,B,I.\n\nCommon words: ""CRANE"" but E out.\n\n""DRANK"" — D R A N K — positions:1=D,2=R,3=A,4=N,5=K — N at position 4.\n\n""FRANK"" — F R A N K — similar.\n\n""PRANK"" — P R A N K.\n\n""TRANK"" not common.\n\n""WRANG"" not word.\n\nSo ""DRANK"", ""FRANK"", ""PRANK"" are candidates.\n\nBut we need to avoid B and I, which we are.\n\nIn these, N is at position 4, which is consistent with the feedback that N is not at position 5.\n\nNow, position 5 is K in these words.\n\nBut we don\'t know if K is in the word.\n\nFor the third guess, we can try one of these to test.\n\nBut we also need to test other letters.\n\nSince we have _ R A _ _, and N must be at 1 or 4.\n\nIf we try a word with N at position 4, and a new letter at position 1 and 5.\n\nFor example, ""CRONY"" but C and O, and position 4 is O? Not N.\n\n""DRONE"" E out.\n\n""GROAN"" — G R O A N? Positions:1=G,2=R,3=O? But position 3 must be A, not O.\n\nPattern must have A at 3, so _ R A _ _\n\n""GROAN"" is G,R,O,A,N — positions:1=G,2=R,3=O,4=A,5=N — but position 3 is O, not A, so invalid.\n\nSo back to _ R A N _ pattern.\n\nWords: DRANK, FRANK, PRANK, WRACK? W R A C K — but C at 4, not N.\n\nWRACK has no N.\n\nSo only if we have N at 4.\n\nOther words: ""URBAN"" — U R B A N — positions:1=U,2=R,3=B? Not A, position 3 is B, not A.\n\n""BARON"" but B out, and position 3 O? Not A.\n\nSo the common ones are DRANK, FRANK, PRANK.\n\nAlso, ""CROWN"" but position 3 O.\n\nNot.\n\n""BRAWN"" B out, and position 3 A? B R A W N — positions:1=B(out),2=R,3=A,4=W,5=N — but B is out, so not possible.\n\nSimilarly, ""DRAWN"" — D R A W N — positions:1=D,2=R,3=A,4=W,5=N — this could be, but W and N.\n\nN at position 5? But feedback says N is not at position 5, so in ""DRAWN"", N is at position 5, which is invalid because N cannot be at position 5.\n\nFeedback from BRAIN: N is in word but not at position 5, so N cannot be at position 5.\n\nTherefore, in the secret word, N is not at position 5, so for pattern _ R A _ _, N must be at position 1 or 4.\n\nIf at position 4, then word is _ R A N _\n\nIf at position 1, then N R A _ _\n\nBut N R A _ _ words are rare, like ""NRA something"", but not common English words.\n\nFor example, ""NRAKA"" not word.\n\nSo probably N is at position 4.\n\nThus, pattern: _ R A N _\n\nNow, position 1 and 5 to be filled.\n\nPosition 1: cannot be S,T,E,B,I (excluded letters), so possible: C,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z but common: C,D,F,G,K,L,M,O,P,U,W\n\nPosition 5: similarly, cannot be S,T,E,B,I, and not N (since N at 4, but N can be only once? Not necessarily, but we don\'t know if duplicate letters. But in feedback, for N, it was only one N in BRAIN, but secret could have multiple. However, we don\'t have information, so assume no duplicate for now.\n\nCommon words with pattern _ R A N _:\n\n- DRANK: D R A N K\n- FRANK: F R A N K\n- PRANK: P R A N K\n- CRANK: C R A N K\n- WRANK not word\n- GRAND: but that has D at 5, but N at 4? GRAND is G,R,A,N,D so position 4=N, 5=D.\n\nGRAND is possible.\n\nSimilarly, BRAND but B out.\n\nSo possible: CRANK, DRANK, FRANK, PRANK, GRAND.\n\nGRAND has G at 1, R at 2, A at 3, N at 4, D at 5.\n\nIn DRANK, D at 1, K at 5.\n\nEtc.\n\nFor the third guess, we can choose one that tests new letters.\n\nFor example, ""CRANK"" has C and K.\n\n""PRANK"" has P and K.\n\n""GRAND"" has G and D.\n\nSince we need to find position 1 and 5, we can choose a word that uses common letters.\n\nAlso, we might want to test if K is present, or D, etc.\n\nAnother idea: since we have limited guesses, we can choose a word that has multiple possibilities.\n\nBut we have 4 guesses left, so we can test.\n\nPerhaps ""CRANK"" to test C and K.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback.\n\nWe also have to consider that the word must be valid.\n\nAnother common word: ""URBAN"" but position 3 is B, not A.\n\nNot.\n\n""ORGAN"" O R G A N — positions:1=O,2=R,3=G? Not A, position 3 is G, not A.\n\nSo not.\n\nSo the main candidates are CRANK, DRANK, FRANK, PRANK, GRAND.\n\nNow, from second guess, we have N not at 5, which is satisfied if N at 4.\n\nIn GRAND, N is at 4, D at 5.\n\nIn DRANK, N at 4, K at 5.\n\nEtc.\n\nFor the third guess, I can pick ""FRANK"" for example.\n\nBut let\'s think about what letters we haven\'t tested.\n\nWe have tested: S,T,A,R,E,B,I,N\n\nA and R are in, N is in.\n\nExcluded: S,T,E,B,I\n\nNot tested: C,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z\n\nCommon: C,D,F,G,K,L,M,O,P,U,W\n\nIn ""FRANK"": F,R,A,N,K\n\nF and K are new.\n\nSimilarly, ""PRANK"": P,R,A,N,K\n\nP and K.\n\n""CRANK"": C,R,A,N,K\n\nC and K.\n\n""GRAND"": G,R,A,N,D\n\nG and D.\n\n""DRANK"": D,R,A,N,K\n\nD and K.\n\nTo maximize information, we might want to include a vowel, like O or U.\n\nBut in the pattern _ R A N _, position 5 is a consonant in these words.\n\nFor example, ""GROAN"" but position 3 not A.\n\nNot possible.\n\n""WRUNG"" not pattern.\n\nSo no vowel at position 5 easily.\n\nPosition 1 could be a vowel, like U, but ""URBAN"" not.\n\n""ORANT"" not word.\n\nSo probably not.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""CRANK"" to test C and K.\n\nBut C and K are less common than D or G.\n\n""GRAND"" has G and D, which are more common.\n\nG is more common than C or K.\n\nLetter frequencies: E,A,R,I,O,T,N,S,L,C,... so C is common, D is common, G less so.\n\nD is more common than G.\n\nIn English, E,A,R,I,O,T,N,S,L,C,U,D,P,M...\n\nD is about 4.3%, P is about 2%, C is 2.7%, K is 0.8%, etc.\n\nBut for Wordle, it might vary.\n\nSince we have N at position 4, and we need position 1 and 5.\n\nIf I guess ""GRAND"", for example, and if it\'s not correct, we get feedback on G and D.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut we can choose a word that doesn\'t necessarily have N at 4, to test if N is at position 1.\n\nFor example, guess a word with N at position 1: N R A ? ?\n\nBut what word? ""NRA something"" — ""NRAIL"" not, ""NRAKE"" not, ""NRAGE"" not, ""DRAIN"" but D R A I N, but I is out, and position 4 I is x, so not.\n\n""TRAIN"" T out.\n\n""GRAIN"" G R A I N, but I out.\n\nSo no common word with N at position 1 and A at 3.\n\nTherefore, N must be at position 4.\n\nSo pattern is _ R A N _\n\nNow, for the third guess, I\'ll choose ""DRANK"" to test D and K.\n\n""DRANK"": D R A N K\n\nPositions:1=D,2=R,3=A,4=N,5=K\n\nIf D is correct, it will show ✓, similarly for K.\n\nIf not, we know.\n\nBut we have other options.\n\nSince we have multiple possibilities, we can choose a word that covers more common letters.\n\nAnother idea: guess a word that has O or U, but in this pattern, it\'s hard.\n\nFor example, ""CROWN"" not.\n\n""BROWN"" B out.\n\nNot.\n\nSo I think ""DRANK"" is fine.\n\nBut let\'s list all possible words to see.\n\nPossible secret words: from Wordle word list, but I don\'t have it, so common words.\n\nCRANK, DRANK, FRANK, PRANK, GRAND.\n\nAlso, ""WRANG"" not.\n\n""TRANS"" T out.\n\n""BRING"" B out, and position 3 I? Not A.\n\nSo about 5 possibilities: CRANK, DRANK, FRANK, PRANK, GRAND.\n\nGRAND has D at 5, while others have K at 5 except GRAND.\n\nIn GRAND, position 5 is D, in others K.\n\nFor the third guess, we can guess one of them to narrow down.\n\nSince we have 4 guesses left, it\'s ok.\n\nBut to be efficient, we can guess a word that tests multiple.\n\nFor example, if I guess ""CRANK"", and if it\'s not correct, we get feedback on C and K.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut let\'s see what the feedback can tell us.\n\nPerhaps guess a word that is not necessarily possible, but tests letters.\n\nFor example, guess ""CROWN"" but position 3 not A.\n\nNot possible because position 3 must be A.\n\nAll guesses must have A at position 3 and R at position 2, because we know R is at position 2.\n\nFrom second guess, R is at position 2, so it must be in the secret word at position 2.\n\nSo all future guesses must have R at position 2 and A at position 3.\n\nSo pattern: ? R A ? ?\n\nAnd N is in the word, not at position 5, so at position 1 or 4.\n\nBut position 1 and 4 are available.\n\nFor the guess, we can have N at position 1 or 4 or not, but we know N is in the word.\n\nIn the third guess, we can put N at position 4 to test.\n\nOr at position 1.\n\nBut position 1 with N is hard, so put at position 4.\n\nSo guess a word with pattern ? R A N ?\n\nThen position 1 and 5 to be guessed.\n\nFor example, ""CRANK"" or ""DRANK"" etc.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""GRAND"" to test G and D.\n\n""GRAND"": G R A N D\n\nThen if G is correct, position 1 is G, and D at 5.\n\nIf not, we know.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut let\'s choose.\n\nSince K is common in many, perhaps guess ""PRANK"" to test P and K.\n\nBut P and K are less common.\n\n""FRANK"" has F, which is less common.\n\n""CRANK"" has C, which is common.\n\nC is more common.\n\nBut in ""CRANK"", position 5 is K.\n\n""GRAND"" has G and D, both common.\n\nD is more common than K.\n\nSo ""GRAND"" might be better.\n\nAlso, ""DRANK"" has D and K, D common, K less.\n\nBut ""GRAND"" has G and D.\n\nI think ""GRAND"" is a good choice.\n\nSo third guess: ""GRAND""\n\nBut let\'s confirm the pattern: G R A N D\n\nPosition 1: G, 2: R, 3: A, 4: N, 5: D\n\nNow, feedback will tell us about G, N, and D.\n\nWe know R and A are correct.\n\nN is in the word, but not at position 5, here it is at position 4, so if N is at position 4 in secret, it might be correct or not, but we know N is present.\n\nIf position 4 is N in secret, then it will be ✓ for N.\n\nIf not, then N is at position 1, and position 4 is something else.\n\nBut we\'ll see.\n\nI think it\'s fine.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""GRAND"".### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Feedback from Previous Guesses:**\n   - **Guess 1: STARE** → Feedback: S(x) T(x) A(✓) R(-) E(x)\n     - A is correct and in position 3.\n     - R is in the word but not in position 4.\n     - S, T, E are absent.\n   - **Guess 2: BRAIN** → Feedback: B(x) R(✓) A(✓) I(x) N(-)\n     - R is correct and in position 2 (confirming position 2 is R).\n     - A is correct and in position 3 (redundant but consistent).\n     - N is in the word but not in position 5.\n     - B and I are absent.\n\n2. **Key Insights:**\n   - **Positions confirmed:**\n     - Position 2: R\n     - Position 3: A\n     - Pattern so far: `_ R A _ _`\n   - **Letters present but position unknown:**\n     - N is in the word, but not at position 5.

Thus, N is more likely at position 4, leading to the pattern `_ R A N _`.\n   - **Remaining positions to solve:** Position 1 and position 5.\n     - Position 1: Must be a letter not in {S, T, E, B, I}.
