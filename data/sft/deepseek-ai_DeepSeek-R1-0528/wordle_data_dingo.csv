We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. These are all frequent in English words.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in word)
 R: x (not in word)
 A: x (not in word)
 N: - (in word but wrong position)
 E: x (not in word)

 Therefore, we know:
 - The letter N is present in the secret word, but it's not in the 4th position (since in ""crane"" N is the 4th letter).
 - The letters C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.

 We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
   Does not contain C, R, A, E (they are absent).
   Contains the letter N, but not in the 4th position.

 Since we only have one letter so far (N), we want to pick a word that uses common letters not yet tested, and includes N in a position other than 4.

 Let's think about common letters left. The alphabet without C, R, A, E: 
   B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We also know the word has N. We should avoid repeating the positions we already tried? Actually, we only know that N is not at position 4 (index 3, if we count 0-indexed).

 Let's generate a word that meets the criteria and uses common letters. We want to cover new letters.

 Possible choices: Consider words with N in positions 0, 1, 2, or 4 (if 5-letter word, positions: 0,1,2,3,4). Remember ""crane"" had N at position 3 (which is index 3). So we must not put N at index 3 again.

 We are going to avoid letters we know are absent: C, R, A, E.

 Some words that come to mind:
   OTHERS? But it's 6 letters -> too long.
   We need 5-letter words.

 Think: 
   Using common consonants and vowels that are left. Vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out). But we don't have many vowels? Actually, A and E are out, so we have I, O, U, and sometimes Y.

 Example words:
   ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T. 
      - Contains N and places it at the 3rd position (index 3). But wait, our last guess had N at index 3. The feedback said N is in the word but not at that position, so we must avoid putting N at index 3 again? Actually, no: the feedback only said the position was wrong, so N could be in the word in another position. But if we put N again at index 3, it would be incorrect, so we want to move it. So in ""POINT"", N is at index 3, same as before? Then we should avoid.

   Let's try putting N at a different index.

   How about ""LINTS"": L, I, N, T, S -> N is at index 2? That's different from index 3.

   But wait, we also have to avoid the absent letters. We know C, R, A, E are absent, and ""LINTS"" doesn't have these.

   However, we must ensure we are using valid English words.

   Alternative: ""JOINT"" -> J, O, I, N, T -> N at index 3 again. So same problem.

   Instead, let's try ""SONIC"": 
      S, O, N, I, C -> but C is absent! We know C is out, so we cannot use C.

   ""POINT"" uses O, I, and P, T. But we are avoiding putting N at index 3.

   We need words that have N at index 0, 1, 2, or 4.

   Index 0: ""NOISE""? N at 0. Then O, I, S, E -> but E is absent! We can't use E.

   Index 1: How about ""UNLIT""? U, N, L, I, T -> N at index 1. Letters: U (vowel), N, L, I (vowel), T. 
      We haven't tested U, L, I, T. But note: E is avoided? Yes, no E. Also no C, R, A.

   However, we must make sure the word is valid. ""UNLIT"" is a word? It means not lit, but let me check - it should be acceptable.

   Another possibility: ""INPUT""? I, N, P, U, T -> N at index 1. But I at index 0? That's acceptable. And no forbidden letters.

   ""GUILD""? G, U, I, L, D -> this word doesn't have an N? So must have N.

   How about ""BUNCH""? B, U, N, C, H -> C is forbidden, so no.

   Let's aim for: N at index 1: 
      Words: 
         UNTIL: U, N, T, I, L -> yes, and it's a valid word. 
         UNFIT: U, N, F, I, T -> valid.

   Also N at index 2: 
         MINTS: M, I, N, T, S -> valid? M, I, N, T, S -> and no forbidden letters.

   Let's choose one with letters we haven't tested to maximize information.

   In ""UNTIL"": 
      Letters: U, N, T, I, L -> we have U (new), T (new), I (new), L (new) and N (we know has appeared).

   In ""MINTS"": M, I, N, T, S -> M, I, T, S are new.

   Either is fine. But note we must avoid the absent letters.

   Another word: ""POINT"" is no due to same N position? Actually, let's clarify: The feedback said N is in the word but not at position 3 (the fourth letter). So if we put N at position 3 again, it will be incorrect because the secret word doesn't have N at position 3. Therefore, we must avoid position 3 for N? Exactly.

   Therefore, we should avoid using N at index 3.

   So ""POINT"" places N at index 3 -> invalid? Because we know N isn't there. So it would be a wasted guess.

   Therefore, let's go with ""UNTIL"": U (new), N (must be at a different position -> index 1 here), T (new), I (new), L (new). 

   Alternatively, if we want to test S, we can choose ""MINTS"". Both are good.

   We haven't tested S in the previous guess? Actually, in ""crane"" we didn't have S. So S is a common letter we haven't tried.

   Moreover, ""MINTS"" has N at index 2, which is a new position.

   Let's try ""MINTS"". It leaves out the letter U, but we can test S. 

   But we also want to use vowels? The word must have vowels? The secret word has at least one vowel? Not necessarily vowels are A, E, I, O, U. Since A and E are absent, the vowel must be I, O, or U? 

   We haven't tested O either. 

   However, ""MINTS"" uses I as a vowel.

   Another candidate: ""POULT"" -> P, O, U, L, T? But no N.

   How about ""MOUNT"": M, O, U, N, T -> This has N at index 3? Position 4 (index 3) -> but that's the same position as before? So we must avoid. Not good.

   ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T -> no N. Won't work.

   ""JOINS"": J, O, I, N, S -> N at index 3? Same problem.

   So let's stick with a word that places N at a new position and uses common letters.

   After considering, I think ""UNTIL"" might be a good candidate: 
        Position 0: U -> not tested
        Position 1: N -> known to be in word (but not at index 3, so this is a new position)
        Position 2: T -> new
        Position 3: I -> new
        Position 4: L -> new

   But note: the secret word might have N at any position except 3. Therefore, placing at 1 is good.

   Alternatively, ""MINTS"" has N at index 2. We can do that too.

   Let's choose ""UNTIL"" because it tests more vowels? We have U and I.

   However, we have another option: ""POUND"" -> P, O, U, N, D -> N at index 3? No, because positions: 
        P (0), O (1), U (2), N (3), D (4) -> index 3! We have to avoid.

   So avoid words that put N at index 3.

   ""DUNKS"": D, U, N, K, S -> N at index 2? Actually: 
        D index0, U index1, N index2 -> that's acceptable.

   But we haven't tested D, U, K, S.

   But ""DUNKS"" is valid? Yes.

   However, let me check: We are constrained by the absence of C, R, A, E, so words without these are allowed.

   Considering commonality and possibility to get more information, let's choose a word that has different vowels and consonants.

   Given the above, I'll choose ""UNTIL"": 
        U (vowel), N (known), T (consonant), I (vowel), L (consonant)

   We'll see what feedback gives.

   Alternatively, if we want to avoid using two vowels in one guess? It's okay.

   Let's go with ""UNTIL"".

   So second guess: ""UNTIL""

   But note: we must make sure the word is in the dictionary. Assuming ""until"" is valid.

   If we are concerned about double letters? We don't see any.

   Therefore, my second guess is ""until"".

<guess>until</guess>
</think>
Based on the previous feedback from ""crane"": 
- C, R, A, E are not in the word at all (marked 'x')
- N is in the word but not in position 4 (marked '-'), meaning it must appear elsewhere

For the next guess:
- Must include N (since it’s confirmed present)
- N cannot be in position 4/index 3 again (from ""crane"")
- Avoid C, R, A, E entirely
- Prioritize common unused letters (e.g., consonants like T, L, S and vowels like I, O, U)

The word ""until"" meets all criteria:
- Contains N in position 2 (index 1), avoiding position 4
- Uses new letters U, T, I, L (all untested in the first guess)
- No forbidden letters (C, R, A, E)

This guess maximizes information by testing four new letters and strategically placing N in a new position.

 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. These are all frequent in English words.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in word)
 R: x (not in word)
 A: x (not in word)
 N: - (in word but wrong position)
 E: x (not in word)

 Therefore, we know:
 - The letter N is present in the secret word, but it's not in the 4th position (since in ""crane"" N is the 4th letter).
 - The letters C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.

 We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
   Does not contain C, R, A, E (they are absent).
   Contains the letter N, but not in the 4th position.

 Since we only have one letter so far (N), we want to pick a word that uses common letters not yet tested, and includes N in a position other than 4.

 Let's think about common letters left. The alphabet without C, R, A, E: 
   B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We also know the word has N. We should avoid repeating the positions we already tried? Actually, we only know that N is not at position 4 (index 3, if we count 0-indexed).

 Let's generate a word that meets the criteria and uses common letters. We want to cover new letters.

 Possible choices: Consider words with N in positions 0, 1, 2, or 4 (if 5-letter word, positions: 0,1,2,3,4). Remember ""crane"" had N at position 3 (which is index 3). So we must not put N at index 3 again.

 We are going to avoid letters we know are absent: C, R, A, E.

 Some words that come to mind:
   OTHERS? But it's 6 letters -> too long.
   We need 5-letter words.

 Think: 
   Using common consonants and vowels that are left. Vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out). But we don't have many vowels? Actually, A and E are out, so we have I, O, U, and sometimes Y.

 Example words:
   ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T. 
      - Contains N and places it at the 3rd position (index 3). But wait, our last guess had N at index 3. The feedback said N is in the word but not at that position, so we must avoid putting N at index 3 again? Actually, no: the feedback only said the position was wrong, so N could be in the word in another position. But if we put N again at index 3, it would be incorrect, so we want to move it. So in ""POINT"", N is at index 3, same as before? Then we should avoid.

   Let's try putting N at a different index.

   How about ""LINTS"": L, I, N, T, S -> N is at index 2? That's different from index 3.

   But wait, we also have to avoid the absent letters. We know C, R, A, E are absent, and ""LINTS"" doesn't have these.

   However, we must ensure we are using valid English words.

   Alternative: ""JOINT"" -> J, O, I, N, T -> N at index 3 again. So same problem.

   Instead, let's try ""SONIC"": 
      S, O, N, I, C -> but C is absent! We know C is out, so we cannot use C.

   ""POINT"" uses O, I, and P, T. But we are avoiding putting N at index 3.

   We need words that have N at index 0, 1, 2, or 4.

   Index 0: ""NOISE""? N at 0. Then O, I, S, E -> but E is absent! We can't use E.

   Index 1: How about ""UNLIT""? U, N, L, I, T -> N at index 1. Letters: U (vowel), N, L, I (vowel), T. 
      We haven't tested U, L, I, T. But note: E is avoided? Yes, no E. Also no C, R, A.

   However, we must make sure the word is valid. ""UNLIT"" is a word? It means not lit, but let me check - it should be acceptable.

   Another possibility: ""INPUT""? I, N, P, U, T -> N at index 1. But I at index 0? That's acceptable. And no forbidden letters.

   ""GUILD""? G, U, I, L, D -> this word doesn't have an N? So must have N.

   How about ""BUNCH""? B, U, N, C, H -> C is forbidden, so no.

   Let's aim for: N at index 1: 
      Words: 
         UNTIL: U, N, T, I, L -> yes, and it's a valid word. 
         UNFIT: U, N, F, I, T -> valid.

   Also N at index 2: 
         MINTS: M, I, N, T, S -> valid? M, I, N, T, S -> and no forbidden letters.

   Let's choose one with letters we haven't tested to maximize information.

   In ""UNTIL"": 
      Letters: U, N, T, I, L -> we have U (new), T (new), I (new), L (new) and N (we know has appeared).

   In ""MINTS"": M, I, N, T, S -> M, I, T, S are new.

   Either is fine. But note we must avoid the absent letters.

   Another word: ""POINT"" is no due to same N position? Actually, let's clarify: The feedback said N is in the word but not at position 3 (the fourth letter). So if we put N at position 3 again, it will be incorrect because the secret word doesn't have N at position 3. Therefore, we must avoid position 3 for N? Exactly.

   Therefore, we should avoid using N at index 3.

   So ""POINT"" places N at index 3 -> invalid? Because we know N isn't there. So it would be a wasted guess.

   Therefore, let's go with ""UNTIL"": U (new), N (must be at a different position -> index 1 here), T (new), I (new), L (new). 

   Alternatively, if we want to test S, we can choose ""MINTS"". Both are good.

   We haven't tested S in the previous guess? Actually, in ""crane"" we didn't have S. So S is a common letter we haven't tried.

   Moreover, ""MINTS"" has N at index 2, which is a new position.

   Let's try ""MINTS"". It leaves out the letter U, but we can test S. 

   But we also want to use vowels? The word must have vowels? The secret word has at least one vowel? Not necessarily vowels are A, E, I, O, U. Since A and E are absent, the vowel must be I, O, or U? 

   We haven't tested O either. 

   However, ""MINTS"" uses I as a vowel.

   Another candidate: ""POULT"" -> P, O, U, L, T? But no N.

   How about ""MOUNT"": M, O, U, N, T -> This has N at index 3? Position 4 (index 3) -> but that's the same position as before? So we must avoid. Not good.

   ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T -> no N. Won't work.

   ""JOINS"": J, O, I, N, S -> N at index 3? Same problem.

   So let's stick with a word that places N at a new position and uses common letters.

   After considering, I think ""UNTIL"" might be a good candidate: 
        Position 0: U -> not tested
        Position 1: N -> known to be in word (but not at index 3, so this is a new position)
        Position 2: T -> new
        Position 3: I -> new
        Position 4: L -> new

   But note: the secret word might have N at any position except 3. Therefore, placing at 1 is good.

   Alternatively, ""MINTS"" has N at index 2. We can do that too.

   Let's choose ""UNTIL"" because it tests more vowels? We have U and I.

   However, we have another option: ""POUND"" -> P, O, U, N, D -> N at index 3? No, because positions: 
        P (0), O (1), U (2), N (3), D (4) -> index 3! We have to avoid.

   So avoid words that put N at index 3.

   ""DUNKS"": D, U, N, K, S -> N at index 2? Actually: 
        D index0, U index1, N index2 -> that's acceptable.

   But we haven't tested D, U, K, S.

   But ""DUNKS"" is valid? Yes.

   However, let me check: We are constrained by the absence of C, R, A, E, so words without these are allowed.

   Considering commonality and possibility to get more information, let's choose a word that has different vowels and consonants.

   Given the above, I'll choose ""UNTIL"": 
        U (vowel), N (known), T (consonant), I (vowel), L (consonant)

   We'll see what feedback gives.

   Alternatively, if we want to avoid using two vowels in one guess? It's okay.

   Let's go with ""UNTIL"".

   So second guess: ""UNTIL""

   But note: we must make sure the word is in the dictionary. Assuming ""until"" is valid.

   If we are concerned about double letters? We don't see any.

   Therefore, my second guess is ""until"".

<guess>until</guess>Based on the previous feedback from ""crane"": 
- C, R, A, E are not in the word at all (marked 'x')
- N is in the word but not in position 4 (marked '-'), meaning it must appear elsewhere

For the next guess:
- Must include N (since it’s confirmed present)
- N cannot be in position 4/index 3 again (from ""crane"")
- Avoid C, R, A, E entirely
- Prioritize common unused letters (e.g., consonants like T, L, S and vowels like I, O, U)

The word ""until"" meets all criteria:
- Contains N in position 2 (index 1), avoiding position 4
- Uses new letters U, T, I, L (all untested in the first guess)
- No forbidden letters (C, R, A, E)

This guess maximizes information by testing four new letters and strategically placing N in a new position.

We are given feedback from the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)
Meaning:
  - C, R, A, E are absent (not in the word at all)
  - N is present but not in the 4th position (index 3)

Guess 2: ""until"" -> U(x), N(-), T(x), I(-), L(x)
Meaning:
  - U, T, L are absent (not in the word at all)
  - N is present but not in the 2nd position (index 1) -> because in ""until"", N is at index 1 and we got a '-', meaning it's in the word but not there.
  - I is present but not in the 4th position (index 3) -> because in ""until"", I is at index 3 and we got a '-'

So now we know:

Absent letters: C, R, A, E, U, T, L

Present letters (but position unknown): N and I

We also know that N is not at index 1 (from ""until"") and not at index 3 (from ""crane""). Similarly, I is not at index 3 (from ""until"").

Since the word is 5 letters, the possible positions for N are: 0, 2, 4 (indices 0, 2, 4) because 1 and 3 are ruled out.

Similarly, I can be at positions 0, 1, 2, 4 (since only index 3 is ruled out).

We must choose a word that:
  - Contains N and I (since they are present)
  - Does not contain any of the absent letters: C, R, A, E, U, T, L
  - Places N in one of the positions: 0, 2, 4 (but not 1 or 3)
  - Places I in a position that is not 3 (so 0,1,2,4) but note we don't know the position of I yet.

Additionally, we want to test new letters to get more information.

The remaining letters (not absent and not yet known to be present) are:
  B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z

But we also have the two known present letters: N and I.

We have 6 tries, and we've used 2, so we have 4 left.

We need to form a 5-letter word that includes N and I, and three other letters from the remaining set, avoiding the absent ones.

We also note that the word must be a valid English word.

Let's think of words that have both N and I, and use common letters from the remaining set.

Possible words:

Option 1: ""POINT"" -> but T is absent (from guess 2: T(x)), so we cannot use T. Also, N is at index 3? But we know N cannot be at index 3. And in ""POINT"", N is at index 3 -> invalid. Also, T is absent.

Option 2: ""JOINS"" -> J, O, I, N, S. 
  - N is at index 3 -> which is forbidden (we know N is not at index 3). So invalid.

Option 3: ""MINIS"" -> M, I, N, I, S -> but has two I's? Also, N is at index 2 -> that's allowed (index 2 is one of 0,2,4). But we have two I's? The word ""minis"" is valid (plural of mini). However, we don't know if the secret word has two I's? It might. But let's check the feedback: in ""until"", we had one I and it was marked present but wrong position. That doesn't rule out two I's. But we have to avoid absent letters: M, I, N, I, S -> no absent letters? M, S are new, I and N are present. But we have two I's? We don't know if that's allowed. However, the feedback for ""until"" only had one I and it was present, but if the word has two I's, then we might get two marks? But we don't know. So ""minis"" is a possibility.

But let's see the positions:
  M at 0, I at 1, N at 2, I at 3, S at 4.
  We know I cannot be at index 3? Because in ""until"", I was at index 3 and we got a '-' meaning it's present but not at that position. So if the secret word has only one I, then we cannot put I at index 3. But if it has two I's, then one of them might be at index 3? Actually, the feedback for ""until"" only tells us that there is at least one I that is not at index 3. It doesn't say anything about a second I. So it's possible that the secret word has an I at index 3? But wait, the feedback for ""until"" at index 3 was I and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means that the I at index 3 is not in the correct position, but if there is another I in the word, that one might be in a correct position? Actually, the feedback doesn't specify which occurrence. But in Wordle, if a letter is repeated, the feedback can be tricky.

However, note that in ""until"", we had one I and it was at index 3. The feedback for that I was '-' meaning: the letter I is in the word but not at this position. So that implies that there is at least one I in the word that is not at index 3. It does not say anything about whether there is an I at index 3? Actually, if the word had an I at index 3, then that I would have been marked as correct (a check) because it's in the right position. But it was marked as '-' meaning that the I at index 3 is not in the right position. Therefore, the secret word does not have an I at index 3. So we can rule out I at index 3.

Therefore, in ""minis"", the I at index 3 would be incorrect (because we know the secret word doesn't have I at index 3) and the I at index 1 might be correct? But we don't know. However, we are allowed to use two I's? But we are trying to test.

But note: we have to avoid using absent letters. We don't know if the word has two I's. But we do know that at least one I is present. So using two I's is acceptable.

But let's see: the word ""minis"" has I at index 1 and index 3. We know index 3 is invalid for I, so the I at index 3 will be marked as either:
   - If the secret word has two I's, then the I at index 3 might be marked as '-' (if there is another I that is not at index 3) or if the secret word has only one I, then the I at index 3 would be marked as 'x'? Actually, no: if the secret word has only one I and we have two I's in the guess, then one of them (the one that is in the correct position) would be marked, and the other would be marked as 'x' if the secret word doesn't have two. But we don't know.

However, we are trying to get information. But we also have to consider that we are limited by the absent letters.

Alternatively, we can avoid using two I's to reduce complexity.

Let me try to find a word with one I and one N, and three new letters.

Possible words:

- ""DINGY"": D, I, N, G, Y -> but D, G, Y are new. 
  Positions: I at index 1, N at index 2 -> both positions are allowed for I and N? 
  For I: we know it cannot be at index 3, but index 1 is allowed. 
  For N: index 2 is allowed (since we have 0,2,4). 
  But we have to check if D, G, Y are allowed? They are not in the absent list.

  However, we have to make sure the word is valid. ""DINGY"" is valid.

- ""WINDY"": W, I, N, D, Y -> similar: I at 1, N at 2. Also valid.

- ""PINKY"": P, I, N, K, Y -> I at 1, N at 2.

But note: we haven't tested D, G, W, P, K, Y, etc.

Another option: ""SINCE"" -> but E is absent. Not allowed.

""MINDS"": M, I, N, D, S -> I at 1, N at 2. This is good.

But we have to avoid T? Yes, T is absent, but ""MINDS"" doesn't have T.

We also have ""HINGE"" -> but E is absent.

""BINGO"": B, I, N, G, O -> I at 1, N at 2. Valid.

""JINGO"": J, I, N, G, O -> same.

Now, we also have the possibility of placing N at index 0 or 4.

For example, ""NOISY"": N, O, I, S, Y -> 
  N at index 0 -> allowed (since not 1 or 3). 
  I at index 2 -> allowed (not 3). 
  But O, S, Y are new.

But ""NOISY"" is valid.

Similarly, ""NOISY"" uses common letters.

Another: ""NOXIS"" -> not a common word.

Or ""INBOX"": I, N, B, O, X -> 
  I at 0, N at 1 -> but wait, N at index 1: we know from ""until"" that N is not at index 1. So we cannot put N at index 1. 
  Therefore, ""INBOX"" has N at index 1 -> invalid.

Similarly, we must avoid N at index 1 and 3.

So for N, only indices 0, 2, 4.

In ""NOISY"": N at 0 -> good.

We can also have N at 4: for example, ""RAINY"" -> but R and A are absent. Not allowed.

""MAINS"": M, A, I, N, S -> A is absent.

""COINS"": C and O, I, N, S -> C is absent.

""JOINS"": N at index 3 -> invalid.

So words with N at 4: 
  ""TOWN"" is 4 letters? We need 5.

  ""TOWNS"": T is absent.

  ""DOWNS"": D, O, W, N, S -> N at 4? 
      D (0), O (1), W (2), N (3)? Wait, that's index 3 -> not allowed.

  How about ""OWING"": O, W, I, N, G -> N at index 4? 
      O(0), W(1), I(2), N(3)? -> index 3 -> not allowed.

  ""AXION"": A is absent.

  ""ZION"" is 4 letters.

  ""BEGIN"": B, E, G, I, N -> E is absent.

  ""BLINI"": B, L, I, N, I -> L is absent.

  ""KININ"": K, I, N, I, N -> but we have two I's and two N's? And we don't know if the word has multiple. But also, we have to avoid absent letters: L is absent? In ""BLINI"", L is absent, but ""KININ"" doesn't have L. However, we have two I's and two N's? The word ""kinin"" is a valid word (a compound). 
      Positions: I at index 1 and 3? But we know I cannot be at index 3. So if we put I at index 3, it will be wrong. 
      Also, N at index 2 and 4? We know N cannot be at index 3, but index 2 and 4 are allowed. 
      But the word: K(0), I(1), N(2), I(3), N(4). 
      The I at index 3 is invalid. So we would get a '-' for the first I? and then for the second I at index 3, we would get an 'x'? Actually, the feedback might be: 
          The first I (index1) might be correct or not, and the second I (index3) is definitely wrong (because we know the secret word doesn't have I at index3). But if the secret word has only one I, then the second I would be marked as absent? 

  This might be confusing.

  So to avoid complexity, let's try to use words without repeated letters.

Therefore, let's go back to words with one I and one N, and no repeated letters.

We have:

- ""DINGY"": D, I, N, G, Y -> I at 1, N at 2.
- ""WINDY"": W, I, N, D, Y -> I at 1, N at 2.
- ""PINKY"": P, I, N, K, Y -> I at 1, N at 2.
- ""MINDS"": M, I, N, D, S -> I at 1, N at 2.
- ""BINGO"": B, I, N, G, O -> I at 1, N at 2.
- ""NOISY"": N, O, I, S, Y -> N at 0, I at 2.

We also have ""NOISY"" which places N at 0 and I at 2.

We want to maximize the information. In ""NOISY"", we are testing N at a new position (index0) and I at index2 (which is new). Also, we are testing O, S, Y.

In the other words, we are testing I at index1 and N at index2, which are both new positions for I and N.

But note: we have two known present letters. We need to find their positions. So testing N at index0 (which is a possibility) and I at index2 (which is also a possibility) is good.

Alternatively, we can test I at index0? 

For example, ""INKED"": I, N, K, E, D -> but E is absent.

""INLAY"": I, N, L, A, Y -> L and A are absent.

""INPUT"": I, N, P, U, T -> U and T are absent.

So it's hard to find a word with I at index0 and N at index1? But N cannot be at index1.

How about I at index0 and N at index2? 
  ""INDOL"": I, N, D, O, L -> but L is absent.

""INDOW"": not a word.

""INFIX"": I, N, F, I, X -> two I's? and X.

So maybe not.

What about I at index4? 
  For example, ""TOWNI"" -> not a word.

  ""BUNION"": too long.

  ""UNION"" -> U is absent.

So it's challenging.

Therefore, let's choose between ""NOISY"" and ""DINGY"".

In ""NOISY"", we are testing N at a position we haven't tried (index0) and I at index2 (which we haven't tried). Also, we are testing O, S, Y.

In ""DINGY"", we are testing I at index1 and N at index2, and D, G, Y.

We have more new letters to test? The more new letters we test, the better.

But note: we have already tested 10 letters (C,R,A,E,U,T,L from the first two guesses, plus N and I which are present). So 10 letters are known (either absent or present). There are 26 letters, so 16 left.

We want to cover as many as possible.

""NOISY"" uses: N, O, I, S, Y -> 3 new letters: O, S, Y.
""DINGY"" uses: D, I, N, G, Y -> 3 new letters: D, G, Y.

Similarly, ""WINDY"" uses W, I, N, D, Y -> 3 new: W, D, Y.

But we have to consider the positions.

We know that N must be at 0,2,4. We have tried N at 3 (in crane) and 1 (in until). Now we can try N at 0 (as in ""NOISY"") or at 2 (as in ""DINGY"", ""WINDY"", etc.). 

Trying N at 0 is a new position, so it might give us more information about the placement of N.

Similarly, for I, we have only tried it at index3 (in until). We know it's not at 3. So we can try it at 0,1,2,4. In ""NOISY"", we try I at index2. In ""DINGY"", we try I at index1.

Both are new positions for I.

So both are good.

But let's pick ""NOISY"" because it tests a new position for N (index0) and also tests S and O which are common.

So I'll go with ""NOISY"".

Therefore, the third guess is ""NOISY"".

<guess>noisy</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Absent Letters**: C, R, A, E, U, T, L (confirmed not in the word)
- **Present Letters (wrong position)**: N and I (must appear in the word, but not at the positions previously guessed)
  - N cannot be at position 4 (from ""crane"") or position 2 (from ""until""), so possible positions: 1, 3, or 5 (1-indexed, i.e., indices 0, 2, or 4).
  - I cannot be at position 4 (from ""until""), so possible positions: 1, 2, 3, or 5 (indices 0, 1, 2, or 4).

For the next guess:
- Must include **N** and **I**.
- Avoid all absent letters (C, R, A, E, U, T, L).
- Test new common letters (e.g., O, S, Y) to maximize information.
- Place N and I in new, untried positions to narrow down their locations.

The word **""NOISY""** fits perfectly:
- **N** at position 1 (index 0) → tests a new position for N (previously untried).
- **I** at position 3 (index 2) → tests a new position for I (previously only tried at position 4).
- **O, S, Y** are new, common letters not yet tested.
- No repeated or absent letters.

This guess efficiently tests key possibilities for N and I while covering three new letters.

<guess>noisy</guess>",noisy,"We are given feedback from the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)
Meaning:
  - C, R, A, E are absent (not in the word at all)
  - N is present but not in the 4th position (index 3)

Guess 2: ""until"" -> U(x), N(-), T(x), I(-), L(x)
Meaning:
  - U, T, L are absent (not in the word at all)
  - N is present but not in the 2nd position (index 1) -> because in ""until"", N is at index 1 and we got a '-', meaning it's in the word but not there.
  - I is present but not in the 4th position (index 3) -> because in ""until"", I is at index 3 and we got a '-'

So now we know:

Absent letters: C, R, A, E, U, T, L

Present letters (but position unknown): N and I

We also know that N is not at index 1 (from ""until"") and not at index 3 (from ""crane""). Similarly, I is not at index 3 (from ""until"").

Since the word is 5 letters, the possible positions for N are: 0, 2, 4 (indices 0, 2, 4) because 1 and 3 are ruled out.

Similarly, I can be at positions 0, 1, 2, 4 (since only index 3 is ruled out).

We must choose a word that:
  - Contains N and I (since they are present)
  - Does not contain any of the absent letters: C, R, A, E, U, T, L
  - Places N in one of the positions: 0, 2, 4 (but not 1 or 3)
  - Places I in a position that is not 3 (so 0,1,2,4) but note we don't know the position of I yet.

Additionally, we want to test new letters to get more information.

The remaining letters (not absent and not yet known to be present) are:
  B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z

But we also have the two known present letters: N and I.

We have 6 tries, and we've used 2, so we have 4 left.

We need to form a 5-letter word that includes N and I, and three other letters from the remaining set, avoiding the absent ones.

We also note that the word must be a valid English word.

Let's think of words that have both N and I, and use common letters from the remaining set.

Possible words:

Option 1: ""POINT"" -> but T is absent (from guess 2: T(x)), so we cannot use T. Also, N is at index 3? But we know N cannot be at index 3. And in ""POINT"", N is at index 3 -> invalid. Also, T is absent.

Option 2: ""JOINS"" -> J, O, I, N, S. 
  - N is at index 3 -> which is forbidden (we know N is not at index 3). So invalid.

Option 3: ""MINIS"" -> M, I, N, I, S -> but has two I's? Also, N is at index 2 -> that's allowed (index 2 is one of 0,2,4). But we have two I's? The word ""minis"" is valid (plural of mini). However, we don't know if the secret word has two I's? It might. But let's check the feedback: in ""until"", we had one I and it was marked present but wrong position. That doesn't rule out two I's. But we have to avoid absent letters: M, I, N, I, S -> no absent letters? M, S are new, I and N are present. But we have two I's? We don't know if that's allowed. However, the feedback for ""until"" only had one I and it was present, but if the word has two I's, then we might get two marks? But we don't know. So ""minis"" is a possibility.

But let's see the positions:
  M at 0, I at 1, N at 2, I at 3, S at 4.
  We know I cannot be at index 3? Because in ""until"", I was at index 3 and we got a '-' meaning it's present but not at that position. So if the secret word has only one I, then we cannot put I at index 3. But if it has two I's, then one of them might be at index 3? Actually, the feedback for ""until"" only tells us that there is at least one I that is not at index 3. It doesn't say anything about a second I. So it's possible that the secret word has an I at index 3? But wait, the feedback for ""until"" at index 3 was I and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means that the I at index 3 is not in the correct position, but if there is another I in the word, that one might be in a correct position? Actually, the feedback doesn't specify which occurrence. But in Wordle, if a letter is repeated, the feedback can be tricky.

However, note that in ""until"", we had one I and it was at index 3. The feedback for that I was '-' meaning: the letter I is in the word but not at this position. So that implies that there is at least one I in the word that is not at index 3. It does not say anything about whether there is an I at index 3? Actually, if the word had an I at index 3, then that I would have been marked as correct (a check) because it's in the right position. But it was marked as '-' meaning that the I at index 3 is not in the right position. Therefore, the secret word does not have an I at index 3. So we can rule out I at index 3.

Therefore, in ""minis"", the I at index 3 would be incorrect (because we know the secret word doesn't have I at index 3) and the I at index 1 might be correct? But we don't know. However, we are allowed to use two I's? But we are trying to test.

But note: we have to avoid using absent letters. We don't know if the word has two I's. But we do know that at least one I is present. So using two I's is acceptable.

But let's see: the word ""minis"" has I at index 1 and index 3. We know index 3 is invalid for I, so the I at index 3 will be marked as either:
   - If the secret word has two I's, then the I at index 3 might be marked as '-' (if there is another I that is not at index 3) or if the secret word has only one I, then the I at index 3 would be marked as 'x'? Actually, no: if the secret word has only one I and we have two I's in the guess, then one of them (the one that is in the correct position) would be marked, and the other would be marked as 'x' if the secret word doesn't have two. But we don't know.

However, we are trying to get information. But we also have to consider that we are limited by the absent letters.

Alternatively, we can avoid using two I's to reduce complexity.

Let me try to find a word with one I and one N, and three new letters.

Possible words:

- ""DINGY"": D, I, N, G, Y -> but D, G, Y are new. 
  Positions: I at index 1, N at index 2 -> both positions are allowed for I and N? 
  For I: we know it cannot be at index 3, but index 1 is allowed. 
  For N: index 2 is allowed (since we have 0,2,4). 
  But we have to check if D, G, Y are allowed? They are not in the absent list.

  However, we have to make sure the word is valid. ""DINGY"" is valid.

- ""WINDY"": W, I, N, D, Y -> similar: I at 1, N at 2. Also valid.

- ""PINKY"": P, I, N, K, Y -> I at 1, N at 2.

But note: we haven't tested D, G, W, P, K, Y, etc.

Another option: ""SINCE"" -> but E is absent. Not allowed.

""MINDS"": M, I, N, D, S -> I at 1, N at 2. This is good.

But we have to avoid T? Yes, T is absent, but ""MINDS"" doesn't have T.

We also have ""HINGE"" -> but E is absent.

""BINGO"": B, I, N, G, O -> I at 1, N at 2. Valid.

""JINGO"": J, I, N, G, O -> same.

Now, we also have the possibility of placing N at index 0 or 4.

For example, ""NOISY"": N, O, I, S, Y -> 
  N at index 0 -> allowed (since not 1 or 3). 
  I at index 2 -> allowed (not 3). 
  But O, S, Y are new.

But ""NOISY"" is valid.

Similarly, ""NOISY"" uses common letters.

Another: ""NOXIS"" -> not a common word.

Or ""INBOX"": I, N, B, O, X -> 
  I at 0, N at 1 -> but wait, N at index 1: we know from ""until"" that N is not at index 1. So we cannot put N at index 1. 
  Therefore, ""INBOX"" has N at index 1 -> invalid.

Similarly, we must avoid N at index 1 and 3.

So for N, only indices 0, 2, 4.

In ""NOISY"": N at 0 -> good.

We can also have N at 4: for example, ""RAINY"" -> but R and A are absent. Not allowed.

""MAINS"": M, A, I, N, S -> A is absent.

""COINS"": C and O, I, N, S -> C is absent.

""JOINS"": N at index 3 -> invalid.

So words with N at 4: 
  ""TOWN"" is 4 letters? We need 5.

  ""TOWNS"": T is absent.

  ""DOWNS"": D, O, W, N, S -> N at 4? 
      D (0), O (1), W (2), N (3)? Wait, that's index 3 -> not allowed.

  How about ""OWING"": O, W, I, N, G -> N at index 4? 
      O(0), W(1), I(2), N(3)? -> index 3 -> not allowed.

  ""AXION"": A is absent.

  ""ZION"" is 4 letters.

  ""BEGIN"": B, E, G, I, N -> E is absent.

  ""BLINI"": B, L, I, N, I -> L is absent.

  ""KININ"": K, I, N, I, N -> but we have two I's and two N's? And we don't know if the word has multiple. But also, we have to avoid absent letters: L is absent? In ""BLINI"", L is absent, but ""KININ"" doesn't have L. However, we have two I's and two N's? The word ""kinin"" is a valid word (a compound). 
      Positions: I at index 1 and 3? But we know I cannot be at index 3. So if we put I at index 3, it will be wrong. 
      Also, N at index 2 and 4? We know N cannot be at index 3, but index 2 and 4 are allowed. 
      But the word: K(0), I(1), N(2), I(3), N(4). 
      The I at index 3 is invalid. So we would get a '-' for the first I? and then for the second I at index 3, we would get an 'x'? Actually, the feedback might be: 
          The first I (index1) might be correct or not, and the second I (index3) is definitely wrong (because we know the secret word doesn't have I at index3). But if the secret word has only one I, then the second I would be marked as absent? 

  This might be confusing.

  So to avoid complexity, let's try to use words without repeated letters.

Therefore, let's go back to words with one I and one N, and no repeated letters.

We have:

- ""DINGY"": D, I, N, G, Y -> I at 1, N at 2.
- ""WINDY"": W, I, N, D, Y -> I at 1, N at 2.
- ""PINKY"": P, I, N, K, Y -> I at 1, N at 2.
- ""MINDS"": M, I, N, D, S -> I at 1, N at 2.
- ""BINGO"": B, I, N, G, O -> I at 1, N at 2.
- ""NOISY"": N, O, I, S, Y -> N at 0, I at 2.

We also have ""NOISY"" which places N at 0 and I at 2.

We want to maximize the information. In ""NOISY"", we are testing N at a new position (index0) and I at index2 (which is new). Also, we are testing O, S, Y.

In the other words, we are testing I at index1 and N at index2, which are both new positions for I and N.

But note: we have two known present letters. We need to find their positions. So testing N at index0 (which is a possibility) and I at index2 (which is also a possibility) is good.

Alternatively, we can test I at index0? 

For example, ""INKED"": I, N, K, E, D -> but E is absent.

""INLAY"": I, N, L, A, Y -> L and A are absent.

""INPUT"": I, N, P, U, T -> U and T are absent.

So it's hard to find a word with I at index0 and N at index1? But N cannot be at index1.

How about I at index0 and N at index2? 
  ""INDOL"": I, N, D, O, L -> but L is absent.

""INDOW"": not a word.

""INFIX"": I, N, F, I, X -> two I's? and X.

So maybe not.

What about I at index4? 
  For example, ""TOWNI"" -> not a word.

  ""BUNION"": too long.

  ""UNION"" -> U is absent.

So it's challenging.

Therefore, let's choose between ""NOISY"" and ""DINGY"".

In ""NOISY"", we are testing N at a position we haven't tried (index0) and I at index2 (which we haven't tried). Also, we are testing O, S, Y.

In ""DINGY"", we are testing I at index1 and N at index2, and D, G, Y.

We have more new letters to test? The more new letters we test, the better.

But note: we have already tested 10 letters (C,R,A,E,U,T,L from the first two guesses, plus N and I which are present). So 10 letters are known (either absent or present). There are 26 letters, so 16 left.

We want to cover as many as possible.

""NOISY"" uses: N, O, I, S, Y -> 3 new letters: O, S, Y.
""DINGY"" uses: D, I, N, G, Y -> 3 new letters: D, G, Y.

Similarly, ""WINDY"" uses W, I, N, D, Y -> 3 new: W, D, Y.

But we have to consider the positions.

We know that N must be at 0,2,4. We have tried N at 3 (in crane) and 1 (in until). Now we can try N at 0 (as in ""NOISY"") or at 2 (as in ""DINGY"", ""WINDY"", etc.). 

Trying N at 0 is a new position, so it might give us more information about the placement of N.

Similarly, for I, we have only tried it at index3 (in until). We know it's not at 3. So we can try it at 0,1,2,4. In ""NOISY"", we try I at index2. In ""DINGY"", we try I at index1.

Both are new positions for I.

So both are good.

But let's pick ""NOISY"" because it tests a new position for N (index0) and also tests S and O which are common.

So I'll go with ""NOISY"".

Therefore, the third guess is ""NOISY"".

<guess>noisy</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Absent Letters**: C, R, A, E, U, T, L (confirmed not in the word)
- **Present Letters (wrong position)**: N and I (must appear in the word, but not at the positions previously guessed)
  - N cannot be at position 4 (from ""crane"") or position 2 (from ""until""), so possible positions: 1, 3, or 5 (1-indexed, i.e., indices 0, 2, or 4).
  - I cannot be at position 4 (from ""until""), so possible positions: 1, 2, 3, or 5 (indices 0, 1, 2, or 4).

For the next guess:
- Must include **N** and **I**.
- Avoid all absent letters (C, R, A, E, U, T, L).
- Test new common letters (e.g., O, S, Y) to maximize information.
- Place N and I in new, untried positions to narrow down their locations.

The word **""NOISY""** fits perfectly:
- **N** at position 1 (index 0) → tests a new position for N (previously untried).
- **I** at position 3 (index 2) → tests a new position for I (previously only tried at position 4).
- **O, S, Y** are new, common letters not yet tested.
- No repeated or absent letters.

This guess efficiently tests key possibilities for N and I while covering three new letters.",Guess 3: noisy -> FEEDBACK: N(-) O(-) I(-) S(x) Y(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,dingo,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. These are all frequent in English words.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in word)
 R: x (not in word)
 A: x (not in word)
 N: - (in word but wrong position)
 E: x (not in word)

 Therefore, we know:
 - The letter N is present in the secret word, but it's not in the 4th position (since in ""crane"" N is the 4th letter).
 - The letters C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.

 We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
   Does not contain C, R, A, E (they are absent).
   Contains the letter N, but not in the 4th position.

 Since we only have one letter so far (N), we want to pick a word that uses common letters not yet tested, and includes N in a position other than 4.

 Let's think about common letters left. The alphabet without C, R, A, E: 
   B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We also know the word has N. We should avoid repeating the positions we already tried? Actually, we only know that N is not at position 4 (index 3, if we count 0-indexed).

 Let's generate a word that meets the criteria and uses common letters. We want to cover new letters.

 Possible choices: Consider words with N in positions 0, 1, 2, or 4 (if 5-letter word, positions: 0,1,2,3,4). Remember ""crane"" had N at position 3 (which is index 3). So we must not put N at index 3 again.

 We are going to avoid letters we know are absent: C, R, A, E.

 Some words that come to mind:
   OTHERS? But it's 6 letters -> too long.
   We need 5-letter words.

 Think: 
   Using common consonants and vowels that are left. Vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out). But we don't have many vowels? Actually, A and E are out, so we have I, O, U, and sometimes Y.

 Example words:
   ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T. 
      - Contains N and places it at the 3rd position (index 3). But wait, our last guess had N at index 3. The feedback said N is in the word but not at that position, so we must avoid putting N at index 3 again? Actually, no: the feedback only said the position was wrong, so N could be in the word in another position. But if we put N again at index 3, it would be incorrect, so we want to move it. So in ""POINT"", N is at index 3, same as before? Then we should avoid.

   Let's try putting N at a different index.

   How about ""LINTS"": L, I, N, T, S -> N is at index 2? That's different from index 3.

   But wait, we also have to avoid the absent letters. We know C, R, A, E are absent, and ""LINTS"" doesn't have these.

   However, we must ensure we are using valid English words.

   Alternative: ""JOINT"" -> J, O, I, N, T -> N at index 3 again. So same problem.

   Instead, let's try ""SONIC"": 
      S, O, N, I, C -> but C is absent! We know C is out, so we cannot use C.

   ""POINT"" uses O, I, and P, T. But we are avoiding putting N at index 3.

   We need words that have N at index 0, 1, 2, or 4.

   Index 0: ""NOISE""? N at 0. Then O, I, S, E -> but E is absent! We can't use E.

   Index 1: How about ""UNLIT""? U, N, L, I, T -> N at index 1. Letters: U (vowel), N, L, I (vowel), T. 
      We haven't tested U, L, I, T. But note: E is avoided? Yes, no E. Also no C, R, A.

   However, we must make sure the word is valid. ""UNLIT"" is a word? It means not lit, but let me check - it should be acceptable.

   Another possibility: ""INPUT""? I, N, P, U, T -> N at index 1. But I at index 0? That's acceptable. And no forbidden letters.

   ""GUILD""? G, U, I, L, D -> this word doesn't have an N? So must have N.

   How about ""BUNCH""? B, U, N, C, H -> C is forbidden, so no.

   Let's aim for: N at index 1: 
      Words: 
         UNTIL: U, N, T, I, L -> yes, and it's a valid word. 
         UNFIT: U, N, F, I, T -> valid.

   Also N at index 2: 
         MINTS: M, I, N, T, S -> valid? M, I, N, T, S -> and no forbidden letters.

   Let's choose one with letters we haven't tested to maximize information.

   In ""UNTIL"": 
      Letters: U, N, T, I, L -> we have U (new), T (new), I (new), L (new) and N (we know has appeared).

   In ""MINTS"": M, I, N, T, S -> M, I, T, S are new.

   Either is fine. But note we must avoid the absent letters.

   Another word: ""POINT"" is no due to same N position? Actually, let's clarify: The feedback said N is in the word but not at position 3 (the fourth letter). So if we put N at position 3 again, it will be incorrect because the secret word doesn't have N at position 3. Therefore, we must avoid position 3 for N? Exactly.

   Therefore, we should avoid using N at index 3.

   So ""POINT"" places N at index 3 -> invalid? Because we know N isn't there. So it would be a wasted guess.

   Therefore, let's go with ""UNTIL"": U (new), N (must be at a different position -> index 1 here), T (new), I (new), L (new). 

   Alternatively, if we want to test S, we can choose ""MINTS"". Both are good.

   We haven't tested S in the previous guess? Actually, in ""crane"" we didn't have S. So S is a common letter we haven't tried.

   Moreover, ""MINTS"" has N at index 2, which is a new position.

   Let's try ""MINTS"". It leaves out the letter U, but we can test S. 

   But we also want to use vowels? The word must have vowels? The secret word has at least one vowel? Not necessarily vowels are A, E, I, O, U. Since A and E are absent, the vowel must be I, O, or U? 

   We haven't tested O either. 

   However, ""MINTS"" uses I as a vowel.

   Another candidate: ""POULT"" -> P, O, U, L, T? But no N.

   How about ""MOUNT"": M, O, U, N, T -> This has N at index 3? Position 4 (index 3) -> but that's the same position as before? So we must avoid. Not good.

   ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T -> no N. Won't work.

   ""JOINS"": J, O, I, N, S -> N at index 3? Same problem.

   So let's stick with a word that places N at a new position and uses common letters.

   After considering, I think ""UNTIL"" might be a good candidate: 
        Position 0: U -> not tested
        Position 1: N -> known to be in word (but not at index 3, so this is a new position)
        Position 2: T -> new
        Position 3: I -> new
        Position 4: L -> new

   But note: the secret word might have N at any position except 3. Therefore, placing at 1 is good.

   Alternatively, ""MINTS"" has N at index 2. We can do that too.

   Let's choose ""UNTIL"" because it tests more vowels? We have U and I.

   However, we have another option: ""POUND"" -> P, O, U, N, D -> N at index 3? No, because positions: 
        P (0), O (1), U (2), N (3), D (4) -> index 3! We have to avoid.

   So avoid words that put N at index 3.

   ""DUNKS"": D, U, N, K, S -> N at index 2? Actually: 
        D index0, U index1, N index2 -> that's acceptable.

   But we haven't tested D, U, K, S.

   But ""DUNKS"" is valid? Yes.

   However, let me check: We are constrained by the absence of C, R, A, E, so words without these are allowed.

   Considering commonality and possibility to get more information, let's choose a word that has different vowels and consonants.

   Given the above, I'll choose ""UNTIL"": 
        U (vowel), N (known), T (consonant), I (vowel), L (consonant)

   We'll see what feedback gives.

   Alternatively, if we want to avoid using two vowels in one guess? It's okay.

   Let's go with ""UNTIL"".

   So second guess: ""UNTIL""

   But note: we must make sure the word is in the dictionary. Assuming ""until"" is valid.

   If we are concerned about double letters? We don't see any.

   Therefore, my second guess is ""until"".

<guess>until</guess>Based on the previous feedback from ""crane"": 
- C, R, A, E are not in the word at all (marked 'x')
- N is in the word but not in position 4 (marked '-'), meaning it must appear elsewhere

For the next guess:
- Must include N (since it’s confirmed present)
- N cannot be in position 4/index 3 again (from ""crane"")
- Avoid C, R, A, E entirely
- Prioritize common unused letters (e.g., consonants like T, L, S and vowels like I, O, U)

The word ""until"" meets all criteria:
- Contains N in position 2 (index 1), avoiding position 4
- Uses new letters U, T, I, L (all untested in the first guess)
- No forbidden letters (C, R, A, E)

This guess maximizes information by testing four new letters and strategically placing N in a new position.

<guess>until</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: until -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) T(x) I(-) L(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)
Meaning:
  - C, R, A, E are absent (not in the word at all)
  - N is present but not in the 4th position (index 3)

Guess 2: ""until"" -> U(x), N(-), T(x), I(-), L(x)
Meaning:
  - U, T, L are absent (not in the word at all)
  - N is present but not in the 2nd position (index 1) -> because in ""until"", N is at index 1 and we got a '-', meaning it's in the word but not there.
  - I is present but not in the 4th position (index 3) -> because in ""until"", I is at index 3 and we got a '-'

So now we know:

Absent letters: C, R, A, E, U, T, L

Present letters (but position unknown): N and I

We also know that N is not at index 1 (from ""until"") and not at index 3 (from ""crane""). Similarly, I is not at index 3 (from ""until"").

Since the word is 5 letters, the possible positions for N are: 0, 2, 4 (indices 0, 2, 4) because 1 and 3 are ruled out.

Similarly, I can be at positions 0, 1, 2, 4 (since only index 3 is ruled out).

We must choose a word that:
  - Contains N and I (since they are present)
  - Does not contain any of the absent letters: C, R, A, E, U, T, L
  - Places N in one of the positions: 0, 2, 4 (but not 1 or 3)
  - Places I in a position that is not 3 (so 0,1,2,4) but note we don't know the position of I yet.

Additionally, we want to test new letters to get more information.

The remaining letters (not absent and not yet known to be present) are:
  B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z

But we also have the two known present letters: N and I.

We have 6 tries, and we've used 2, so we have 4 left.

We need to form a 5-letter word that includes N and I, and three other letters from the remaining set, avoiding the absent ones.

We also note that the word must be a valid English word.

Let's think of words that have both N and I, and use common letters from the remaining set.

Possible words:

Option 1: ""POINT"" -> but T is absent (from guess 2: T(x)), so we cannot use T. Also, N is at index 3? But we know N cannot be at index 3. And in ""POINT"", N is at index 3 -> invalid. Also, T is absent.

Option 2: ""JOINS"" -> J, O, I, N, S. 
  - N is at index 3 -> which is forbidden (we know N is not at index 3). So invalid.

Option 3: ""MINIS"" -> M, I, N, I, S -> but has two I's? Also, N is at index 2 -> that's allowed (index 2 is one of 0,2,4). But we have two I's? The word ""minis"" is valid (plural of mini). However, we don't know if the secret word has two I's? It might. But let's check the feedback: in ""until"", we had one I and it was marked present but wrong position. That doesn't rule out two I's. But we have to avoid absent letters: M, I, N, I, S -> no absent letters? M, S are new, I and N are present. But we have two I's? We don't know if that's allowed. However, the feedback for ""until"" only had one I and it was present, but if the word has two I's, then we might get two marks? But we don't know. So ""minis"" is a possibility.

But let's see the positions:
  M at 0, I at 1, N at 2, I at 3, S at 4.
  We know I cannot be at index 3? Because in ""until"", I was at index 3 and we got a '-' meaning it's present but not at that position. So if the secret word has only one I, then we cannot put I at index 3. But if it has two I's, then one of them might be at index 3? Actually, the feedback for ""until"" only tells us that there is at least one I that is not at index 3. It doesn't say anything about a second I. So it's possible that the secret word has an I at index 3? But wait, the feedback for ""until"" at index 3 was I and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means that the I at index 3 is not in the correct position, but if there is another I in the word, that one might be in a correct position? Actually, the feedback doesn't specify which occurrence. But in Wordle, if a letter is repeated, the feedback can be tricky.

However, note that in ""until"", we had one I and it was at index 3. The feedback for that I was '-' meaning: the letter I is in the word but not at this position. So that implies that there is at least one I in the word that is not at index 3. It does not say anything about whether there is an I at index 3? Actually, if the word had an I at index 3, then that I would have been marked as correct (a check) because it's in the right position. But it was marked as '-' meaning that the I at index 3 is not in the right position. Therefore, the secret word does not have an I at index 3. So we can rule out I at index 3.

Therefore, in ""minis"", the I at index 3 would be incorrect (because we know the secret word doesn't have I at index 3) and the I at index 1 might be correct? But we don't know. However, we are allowed to use two I's? But we are trying to test.

But note: we have to avoid using absent letters. We don't know if the word has two I's. But we do know that at least one I is present. So using two I's is acceptable.

But let's see: the word ""minis"" has I at index 1 and index 3. We know index 3 is invalid for I, so the I at index 3 will be marked as either:
   - If the secret word has two I's, then the I at index 3 might be marked as '-' (if there is another I that is not at index 3) or if the secret word has only one I, then the I at index 3 would be marked as 'x'? Actually, no: if the secret word has only one I and we have two I's in the guess, then one of them (the one that is in the correct position) would be marked, and the other would be marked as 'x' if the secret word doesn't have two. But we don't know.

However, we are trying to get information. But we also have to consider that we are limited by the absent letters.

Alternatively, we can avoid using two I's to reduce complexity.

Let me try to find a word with one I and one N, and three new letters.

Possible words:

- ""DINGY"": D, I, N, G, Y -> but D, G, Y are new. 
  Positions: I at index 1, N at index 2 -> both positions are allowed for I and N? 
  For I: we know it cannot be at index 3, but index 1 is allowed. 
  For N: index 2 is allowed (since we have 0,2,4). 
  But we have to check if D, G, Y are allowed? They are not in the absent list.

  However, we have to make sure the word is valid. ""DINGY"" is valid.

- ""WINDY"": W, I, N, D, Y -> similar: I at 1, N at 2. Also valid.

- ""PINKY"": P, I, N, K, Y -> I at 1, N at 2.

But note: we haven't tested D, G, W, P, K, Y, etc.

Another option: ""SINCE"" -> but E is absent. Not allowed.

""MINDS"": M, I, N, D, S -> I at 1, N at 2. This is good.

But we have to avoid T? Yes, T is absent, but ""MINDS"" doesn't have T.

We also have ""HINGE"" -> but E is absent.

""BINGO"": B, I, N, G, O -> I at 1, N at 2. Valid.

""JINGO"": J, I, N, G, O -> same.

Now, we also have the possibility of placing N at index 0 or 4.

For example, ""NOISY"": N, O, I, S, Y -> 
  N at index 0 -> allowed (since not 1 or 3). 
  I at index 2 -> allowed (not 3). 
  But O, S, Y are new.

But ""NOISY"" is valid.

Similarly, ""NOISY"" uses common letters.

Another: ""NOXIS"" -> not a common word.

Or ""INBOX"": I, N, B, O, X -> 
  I at 0, N at 1 -> but wait, N at index 1: we know from ""until"" that N is not at index 1. So we cannot put N at index 1. 
  Therefore, ""INBOX"" has N at index 1 -> invalid.

Similarly, we must avoid N at index 1 and 3.

So for N, only indices 0, 2, 4.

In ""NOISY"": N at 0 -> good.

We can also have N at 4: for example, ""RAINY"" -> but R and A are absent. Not allowed.

""MAINS"": M, A, I, N, S -> A is absent.

""COINS"": C and O, I, N, S -> C is absent.

""JOINS"": N at index 3 -> invalid.

So words with N at 4: 
  ""TOWN"" is 4 letters? We need 5.

  ""TOWNS"": T is absent.

  ""DOWNS"": D, O, W, N, S -> N at 4? 
      D (0), O (1), W (2), N (3)? Wait, that's index 3 -> not allowed.

  How about ""OWING"": O, W, I, N, G -> N at index 4? 
      O(0), W(1), I(2), N(3)? -> index 3 -> not allowed.

  ""AXION"": A is absent.

  ""ZION"" is 4 letters.

  ""BEGIN"": B, E, G, I, N -> E is absent.

  ""BLINI"": B, L, I, N, I -> L is absent.

  ""KININ"": K, I, N, I, N -> but we have two I's and two N's? And we don't know if the word has multiple. But also, we have to avoid absent letters: L is absent? In ""BLINI"", L is absent, but ""KININ"" doesn't have L. However, we have two I's and two N's? The word ""kinin"" is a valid word (a compound). 
      Positions: I at index 1 and 3? But we know I cannot be at index 3. So if we put I at index 3, it will be wrong. 
      Also, N at index 2 and 4? We know N cannot be at index 3, but index 2 and 4 are allowed. 
      But the word: K(0), I(1), N(2), I(3), N(4). 
      The I at index 3 is invalid. So we would get a '-' for the first I? and then for the second I at index 3, we would get an 'x'? Actually, the feedback might be: 
          The first I (index1) might be correct or not, and the second I (index3) is definitely wrong (because we know the secret word doesn't have I at index3). But if the secret word has only one I, then the second I would be marked as absent? 

  This might be confusing.

  So to avoid complexity, let's try to use words without repeated letters.

Therefore, let's go back to words with one I and one N, and no repeated letters.

We have:

- ""DINGY"": D, I, N, G, Y -> I at 1, N at 2.
- ""WINDY"": W, I, N, D, Y -> I at 1, N at 2.
- ""PINKY"": P, I, N, K, Y -> I at 1, N at 2.
- ""MINDS"": M, I, N, D, S -> I at 1, N at 2.
- ""BINGO"": B, I, N, G, O -> I at 1, N at 2.
- ""NOISY"": N, O, I, S, Y -> N at 0, I at 2.

We also have ""NOISY"" which places N at 0 and I at 2.

We want to maximize the information. In ""NOISY"", we are testing N at a new position (index0) and I at index2 (which is new). Also, we are testing O, S, Y.

In the other words, we are testing I at index1 and N at index2, which are both new positions for I and N.

But note: we have two known present letters. We need to find their positions. So testing N at index0 (which is a possibility) and I at index2 (which is also a possibility) is good.

Alternatively, we can test I at index0? 

For example, ""INKED"": I, N, K, E, D -> but E is absent.

""INLAY"": I, N, L, A, Y -> L and A are absent.

""INPUT"": I, N, P, U, T -> U and T are absent.

So it's hard to find a word with I at index0 and N at index1? But N cannot be at index1.

How about I at index0 and N at index2? 
  ""INDOL"": I, N, D, O, L -> but L is absent.

""INDOW"": not a word.

""INFIX"": I, N, F, I, X -> two I's? and X.

So maybe not.

What about I at index4? 
  For example, ""TOWNI"" -> not a word.

  ""BUNION"": too long.

  ""UNION"" -> U is absent.

So it's challenging.

Therefore, let's choose between ""NOISY"" and ""DINGY"".

In ""NOISY"", we are testing N at a position we haven't tried (index0) and I at index2 (which we haven't tried). Also, we are testing O, S, Y.

In ""DINGY"", we are testing I at index1 and N at index2, and D, G, Y.

We have more new letters to test? The more new letters we test, the better.

But note: we have already tested 10 letters (C,R,A,E,U,T,L from the first two guesses, plus N and I which are present). So 10 letters are known (either absent or present). There are 26 letters, so 16 left.

We want to cover as many as possible.

""NOISY"" uses: N, O, I, S, Y -> 3 new letters: O, S, Y.
""DINGY"" uses: D, I, N, G, Y -> 3 new letters: D, G, Y.

Similarly, ""WINDY"" uses W, I, N, D, Y -> 3 new: W, D, Y.

But we have to consider the positions.

We know that N must be at 0,2,4. We have tried N at 3 (in crane) and 1 (in until). Now we can try N at 0 (as in ""NOISY"") or at 2 (as in ""DINGY"", ""WINDY"", etc.). 

Trying N at 0 is a new position, so it might give us more information about the placement of N.

Similarly, for I, we have only tried it at index3 (in until). We know it's not at 3. So we can try it at 0,1,2,4. In ""NOISY"", we try I at index2. In ""DINGY"", we try I at index1.

Both are new positions for I.

So both are good.

But let's pick ""NOISY"" because it tests a new position for N (index0) and also tests S and O which are common.

So I'll go with ""NOISY"".

Therefore, the third guess is ""NOISY"".

<guess>noisy</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Absent Letters**: C, R, A, E, U, T, L (confirmed not in the word)
- **Present Letters (wrong position)**: N and I (must appear in the word, but not at the positions previously guessed)
  - N cannot be at position 4 (from ""crane"") or position 2 (from ""until""), so possible positions: 1, 3, or 5 (1-indexed, i.e., indices 0, 2, or 4).
  - I cannot be at position 4 (from ""until""), so possible positions: 1, 2, 3, or 5 (indices 0, 1, 2, or 4).

For the next guess:
- Must include **N** and **I**.
- Avoid all absent letters (C, R, A, E, U, T, L).
- Test new common letters (e.g., O, S, Y) to maximize information.
- Place N and I in new, untried positions to narrow down their locations.

The word **""NOISY""** fits perfectly:
- **N** at position 1 (index 0) → tests a new position for N (previously untried).
- **I** at position 3 (index 2) → tests a new position for I (previously only tried at position 4).
- **O, S, Y** are new, common letters not yet tested.
- No repeated or absent letters.

This guess efficiently tests key possibilities for N and I while covering three new letters.

The alphabet without C, R, A, E: \n   B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n We also know the word has N. We should avoid repeating the positions we already tried? Actually, we only know that N is not at position 4 (index 3, if we count 0-indexed).\n\n Let\'s generate a word that meets the criteria and uses common letters. We want to cover new letters.\n\n Possible choices: Consider words with N in positions 0, 1, 2, or 4 (if 5-letter word, positions: 0,1,2,3,4). Remember ""crane"" had N at position 3 (which is index 3). So we must not put N at index 3 again.\n\n We are going to avoid letters we know are absent: C, R, A, E.\n\n Some words that come to mind:\n   OTHERS? But it\'s 6 letters -> too long.\n   We need 5-letter words.\n\n Think: \n   Using common consonants and vowels that are left. Vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out). But we don\'t have many vowels? Actually, A and E are out, so we have I, O, U, and sometimes Y.\n\n Example words:\n   ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T. \n      - Contains N and places it at the 3rd position (index 3). But wait, our last guess had N at index 3. The feedback said N is in the word but not at that position, so we must avoid putting N at index 3 again? Actually, no: the feedback only said the position was wrong, so N could be in the word in another position. But if we put N again at index 3, it would be incorrect, so we want to move it. So in ""POINT"", N is at index 3, same as before? Then we should avoid.\n\n   Let\'s try putting N at a different index.\n\n   How about ""LINTS"": L, I, N, T, S -> N is at index 2? That\'s different from index 3.\n\n   But wait, we also have to avoid the absent letters. We know C, R, A, E are absent, and ""LINTS"" doesn\'t have these.\n\n   However, we must ensure we are using valid English words.\n\n   Alternative: ""JOINT"" -> J, O, I, N, T -> N at index 3 again. So same problem.\n\n   Instead, let\'s try ""SONIC"": \n      S, O, N, I, C -> but C is absent! We know C is out, so we cannot use C.\n\n   ""POINT"" uses O, I, and P, T. But we are avoiding putting N at index 3.\n\n   We need words that have N at index 0, 1, 2, or 4.\n\n   Index 0: ""NOISE""? N at 0. Then O, I, S, E -> but E is absent! We can\'t use E.\n\n   Index 1: How about ""UNLIT""? U, N, L, I, T -> N at index 1. Letters: U (vowel), N, L, I (vowel), T. \n      We haven\'t tested U, L, I, T. But note: E is avoided? Yes, no E. Also no C, R, A.\n\n   However, we must make sure the word is valid. ""UNLIT"" is a word? It means not lit, but let me check - it should be acceptable.\n\n   Another possibility: ""INPUT""? I, N, P, U, T -> N at index 1. But I at index 0? That\'s acceptable. And no forbidden letters.\n\n   ""GUILD""? G, U, I, L, D -> this word doesn\'t have an N? So must have N.\n\n   How about ""BUNCH""? B, U, N, C, H -> C is forbidden, so no.\n\n   Let\'s aim for: N at index 1: \n      Words: \n         UNTIL: U, N, T, I, L -> yes, and it\'s a valid word. \n         UNFIT: U, N, F, I, T -> valid.\n\n   Also N at index 2: \n         MINTS: M, I, N, T, S -> valid? M, I, N, T, S -> and no forbidden letters.\n\n   Let\'s choose one with letters we haven\'t tested to maximize information.\n\n   In ""UNTIL"": \n      Letters: U, N, T, I, L -> we have U (new), T (new), I (new), L (new) and N (we know has appeared).\n\n   In ""MINTS"": M, I, N, T, S -> M, I, T, S are new.\n\n   Either is fine. But note we must avoid the absent letters.\n\n   Another word: ""POINT"" is no due to same N position? Actually, let\'s clarify: The feedback said N is in the word but not at position 3 (the fourth letter). So if we put N at position 3 again, it will be incorrect because the secret word doesn\'t have N at position 3. Therefore, we must avoid position 3 for N? Exactly.\n\n   Therefore, we should avoid using N at index 3.\n\n   So ""POINT"" places N at index 3 -> invalid? Because we know N isn\'t there. So it would be a wasted guess.\n\n   Therefore, let\'s go with ""UNTIL"": U (new), N (must be at a different position -> index 1 here), T (new), I (new), L (new). \n\n   Alternatively, if we want to test S, we can choose ""MINTS"". Both are good.\n\n   We haven\'t tested S in the previous guess? Actually, in ""crane"" we didn\'t have S. So S is a common letter we haven\'t tried.\n\n   Moreover, ""MINTS"" has N at index 2, which is a new position.\n\n   Let\'s try ""MINTS"". It leaves out the letter U, but we can test S. \n\n   But we also want to use vowels? The word must have vowels? The secret word has at least one vowel? Not necessarily vowels are A, E, I, O, U. Since A and E are absent, the vowel must be I, O, or U? \n\n   We haven\'t tested O either. \n\n   However, ""MINTS"" uses I as a vowel.\n\n   Another candidate: ""POULT"" -> P, O, U, L, T? But no N.\n\n   How about ""MOUNT"": M, O, U, N, T -> This has N at index 3? Position 4 (index 3) -> but that\'s the same position as before? So we must avoid. Not good.\n\n   ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T -> no N. Won\'t work.\n\n   ""JOINS"": J, O, I, N, S -> N at index 3? Same problem.\n\n   So let\'s stick with a word that places N at a new position and uses common letters.\n\n   After considering, I think ""UNTIL"" might be a good candidate: \n        Position 0: U -> not tested\n        Position 1: N -> known to be in word (but not at index 3, so this is a new position)\n        Position 2: T -> new\n        Position 3: I -> new\n        Position 4: L -> new\n\n   But note: the secret word might have N at any position except 3. Therefore, placing at 1 is good.\n\n   Alternatively, ""MINTS"" has N at index 2. We can do that too.\n\n   Let\'s choose ""UNTIL"" because it tests more vowels? We have U and I.\n\n   However, we have another option: ""POUND"" -> P, O, U, N, D -> N at index 3? No, because positions: \n        P (0), O (1), U (2), N (3), D (4) -> index 3! We have to avoid.\n\n   So avoid words that put N at index 3.\n\n   ""DUNKS"": D, U, N, K, S -> N at index 2? Actually: \n        D index0, U index1, N index2 -> that\'s acceptable.\n\n   But we haven\'t tested D, U, K, S.\n\n   But ""DUNKS"" is valid? Yes.\n\n   However, let me check: We are constrained by the absence of C, R, A, E, so words without these are allowed.\n\n   Considering commonality and possibility to get more information, let\'s choose a word that has different vowels and consonants.\n\n   Given the above, I\'ll choose ""UNTIL"": \n        U (vowel), N (known), T (consonant), I (vowel), L (consonant)\n\n   We\'ll see what feedback gives.\n\n   Alternatively, if we want to avoid using two vowels in one guess? It\'s okay.\n\n   Let\'s go with ""UNTIL"".\n\n   So second guess: ""UNTIL""\n\n   But note: we must make sure the word is in the dictionary. Assuming ""until"" is valid.\n\n   If we are concerned about double letters? We don\'t see any.\n\n   Therefore, my second guess is ""until"".\n\n<guess>until</guess>Based on the previous feedback from ""crane"": \n- C, R, A, E are not in the word at all (marked \'x\')\n- N is in the word but not in position 4 (marked \'-\'), meaning it must appear elsewhere\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include N (since it’s confirmed present)\n- N cannot be in position 4/index 3 again (from ""crane"")\n- Avoid C, R, A, E entirely\n- Prioritize common unused letters (e.g., consonants like T, L, S and vowels like I, O, U)\n\nThe word ""until"" meets all criteria:\n- Contains N in position 2 (index 1), avoiding position 4\n- Uses new letters U, T, I, L (all untested in the first guess)\n- No forbidden letters (C, R, A, E)\n\nThis guess maximizes information by testing four new letters and strategically placing N in a new position.\n\n<guess>until</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: until -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) T(x) I(-) L(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from the first two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)\nMeaning:\n  - C, R, A, E are absent (not in the word at all)\n  - N is present but not in the 4th position (index 3)\n\nGuess 2: ""until"" -> U(x), N(-), T(x), I(-), L(x)\nMeaning:\n  - U, T, L are absent (not in the word at all)\n  - N is present but not in the 2nd position (index 1) -> because in ""until"", N is at index 1 and we got a \'-\', meaning it\'s in the word but not there.\n  - I is present but not in the 4th position (index 3) -> because in ""until"", I is at index 3 and we got a \'-\'\n\nSo now we know:\n\nAbsent letters: C, R, A, E, U, T, L\n\nPresent letters (but position unknown): N and I\n\nWe also know that N is not at index 1 (from ""until"") and not at index 3 (from ""crane""). Similarly, I is not at index 3 (from ""until"").\n\nSince the word is 5 letters, the possible positions for N are: 0, 2, 4 (indices 0, 2, 4) because 1 and 3 are ruled out.\n\nSimilarly, I can be at positions 0, 1, 2, 4 (since only index 3 is ruled out).\n\nWe must choose a word that:\n  - Contains N and I (since they are present)\n  - Does not contain any of the absent letters: C, R, A, E, U, T, L\n  - Places N in one of the positions: 0, 2, 4 (but not 1 or 3)\n  - Places I in a position that is not 3 (so 0,1,2,4) but note we don\'t know the position of I yet.\n\nAdditionally, we want to test new letters to get more information.\n\nThe remaining letters (not absent and not yet known to be present) are:\n  B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nBut we also have the two known present letters: N and I.\n\nWe have 6 tries, and we\'ve used 2, so we have 4 left.\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that includes N and I, and three other letters from the remaining set, avoiding the absent ones.\n\nWe also note that the word must be a valid English word.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have both N and I, and use common letters from the remaining set.\n\nPossible words:\n\nOption 1: ""POINT"" -> but T is absent (from guess 2: T(x)), so we cannot use T. Also, N is at index 3? But we know N cannot be at index 3. And in ""POINT"", N is at index 3 -> invalid. Also, T is absent.\n\nOption 2: ""JOINS"" -> J, O, I, N, S. \n  - N is at index 3 -> which is forbidden (we know N is not at index 3). So invalid.\n\nOption 3: ""MINIS"" -> M, I, N, I, S -> but has two I\'s? Also, N is at index 2 -> that\'s allowed (index 2 is one of 0,2,4). But we have two I\'s? The word ""minis"" is valid (plural of mini). However, we don\'t know if the secret word has two I\'s? It might. But let\'s check the feedback: in ""until"", we had one I and it was marked present but wrong position. That doesn\'t rule out two I\'s. But we have to avoid absent letters: M, I, N, I, S -> no absent letters? M, S are new, I and N are present. But we have two I\'s? We don\'t know if that\'s allowed. However, the feedback for ""until"" only had one I and it was present, but if the word has two I\'s, then we might get two marks? But we don\'t know. So ""minis"" is a possibility.\n\nBut let\'s see the positions:\n  M at 0, I at 1, N at 2, I at 3, S at 4.\n  We know I cannot be at index 3? Because in ""until"", I was at index 3 and we got a \'-\' meaning it\'s present but not at that position. So if the secret word has only one I, then we cannot put I at index 3. But if it has two I\'s, then one of them might be at index 3? Actually, the feedback for ""until"" only tells us that there is at least one I that is not at index 3. It doesn\'t say anything about a second I. So it\'s possible that the secret word has an I at index 3? But wait, the feedback for ""until"" at index 3 was I and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means that the I at index 3 is not in the correct position, but if there is another I in the word, that one might be in a correct position? Actually, the feedback doesn\'t specify which occurrence. But in Wordle, if a letter is repeated, the feedback can be tricky.\n\nHowever, note that in ""until"", we had one I and it was at index 3. The feedback for that I was \'-\' meaning: the letter I is in the word but not at this position. So that implies that there is at least one I in the word that is not at index 3. It does not say anything about whether there is an I at index 3? Actually, if the word had an I at index 3, then that I would have been marked as correct (a check) because it\'s in the right position. But it was marked as \'-\' meaning that the I at index 3 is not in the right position. Therefore, the secret word does not have an I at index 3. So we can rule out I at index 3.\n\nTherefore, in ""minis"", the I at index 3 would be incorrect (because we know the secret word doesn\'t have I at index 3) and the I at index 1 might be correct? But we don\'t know. However, we are allowed to use two I\'s? But we are trying to test.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid using absent letters. We don\'t know if the word has two I\'s. But we do know that at least one I is present. So using two I\'s is acceptable.\n\nBut let\'s see: the word ""minis"" has I at index 1 and index 3. We know index 3 is invalid for I, so the I at index 3 will be marked as either:\n   - If the secret word has two I\'s, then the I at index 3 might be marked as \'-\' (if there is another I that is not at index 3) or if the secret word has only one I, then the I at index 3 would be marked as \'x\'? Actually, no: if the secret word has only one I and we have two I\'s in the guess, then one of them (the one that is in the correct position) would be marked, and the other would be marked as \'x\' if the secret word doesn\'t have two. But we don\'t know.\n\nHowever, we are trying to get information. But we also have to consider that we are limited by the absent letters.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid using two I\'s to reduce complexity.\n\nLet me try to find a word with one I and one N, and three new letters.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""DINGY"": D, I, N, G, Y -> but D, G, Y are new. \n  Positions: I at index 1, N at index 2 -> both positions are allowed for I and N? \n  For I: we know it cannot be at index 3, but index 1 is allowed. \n  For N: index 2 is allowed (since we have 0,2,4). \n  But we have to check if D, G, Y are allowed? They are not in the absent list.\n\n  However, we have to make sure the word is valid. ""DINGY"" is valid.\n\n- ""WINDY"": W, I, N, D, Y -> similar: I at 1, N at 2. Also valid.\n\n- ""PINKY"": P, I, N, K, Y -> I at 1, N at 2.\n\nBut note: we haven\'t tested D, G, W, P, K, Y, etc.\n\nAnother option: ""SINCE"" -> but E is absent. Not allowed.\n\n""MINDS"": M, I, N, D, S -> I at 1, N at 2. This is good.\n\nBut we have to avoid T? Yes, T is absent, but ""MINDS"" doesn\'t have T.\n\nWe also have ""HINGE"" -> but E is absent.\n\n""BINGO"": B, I, N, G, O -> I at 1, N at 2. Valid.\n\n""JINGO"": J, I, N, G, O -> same.\n\nNow, we also have the possibility of placing N at index 0 or 4.\n\nFor example, ""NOISY"": N, O, I, S, Y -> \n  N at index 0 -> allowed (since not 1 or 3). \n  I at index 2 -> allowed (not 3). \n  But O, S, Y are new.\n\nBut ""NOISY"" is valid.\n\nSimilarly, ""NOISY"" uses common letters.\n\nAnother: ""NOXIS"" -> not a common word.\n\nOr ""INBOX"": I, N, B, O, X -> \n  I at 0, N at 1 -> but wait, N at index 1: we know from ""until"" that N is not at index 1. So we cannot put N at index 1. \n  Therefore, ""INBOX"" has N at index 1 -> invalid.\n\nSimilarly, we must avoid N at index 1 and 3.\n\nSo for N, only indices 0, 2, 4.\n\nIn ""NOISY"": N at 0 -> good.\n\nWe can also have N at 4: for example, ""RAINY"" -> but R and A are absent. Not allowed.\n\n""MAINS"": M, A, I, N, S -> A is absent.\n\n""COINS"": C and O, I, N, S -> C is absent.\n\n""JOINS"": N at index 3 -> invalid.\n\nSo words with N at 4: \n  ""TOWN"" is 4 letters? We need 5.\n\n  ""TOWNS"": T is absent.\n\n  ""DOWNS"": D, O, W, N, S -> N at 4? \n      D (0), O (1), W (2), N (3)? Wait, that\'s index 3 -> not allowed.\n\n  How about ""OWING"": O, W, I, N, G -> N at index 4? \n      O(0), W(1), I(2), N(3)? -> index 3 -> not allowed.\n\n  ""AXION"": A is absent.\n\n  ""ZION"" is 4 letters.\n\n  ""BEGIN"": B, E, G, I, N -> E is absent.\n\n  ""BLINI"": B, L, I, N, I -> L is absent.\n\n  ""KININ"": K, I, N, I, N -> but we have two I\'s and two N\'s? And we don\'t know if the word has multiple. But also, we have to avoid absent letters: L is absent? In ""BLINI"", L is absent, but ""KININ"" doesn\'t have L. However, we have two I\'s and two N\'s? The word ""kinin"" is a valid word (a compound). \n      Positions: I at index 1 and 3? But we know I cannot be at index 3. So if we put I at index 3, it will be wrong. \n      Also, N at index 2 and 4? We know N cannot be at index 3, but index 2 and 4 are allowed. \n      But the word: K(0), I(1), N(2), I(3), N(4). \n      The I at index 3 is invalid. So we would get a \'-\' for the first I? and then for the second I at index 3, we would get an \'x\'? Actually, the feedback might be: \n          The first I (index1) might be correct or not, and the second I (index3) is definitely wrong (because we know the secret word doesn\'t have I at index3). But if the secret word has only one I, then the second I would be marked as absent? \n\n  This might be confusing.\n\n  So to avoid complexity, let\'s try to use words without repeated letters.\n\nTherefore, let\'s go back to words with one I and one N, and no repeated letters.\n\nWe have:\n\n- ""DINGY"": D, I, N, G, Y -> I at 1, N at 2.\n- ""WINDY"": W, I, N, D, Y -> I at 1, N at 2.\n- ""PINKY"": P, I, N, K, Y -> I at 1, N at 2.\n- ""MINDS"": M, I, N, D, S -> I at 1, N at 2.\n- ""BINGO"": B, I, N, G, O -> I at 1, N at 2.\n- ""NOISY"": N, O, I, S, Y -> N at 0, I at 2.\n\nWe also have ""NOISY"" which places N at 0 and I at 2.\n\nWe want to maximize the information. In ""NOISY"", we are testing N at a new position (index0) and I at index2 (which is new). Also, we are testing O, S, Y.\n\nIn the other words, we are testing I at index1 and N at index2, which are both new positions for I and N.\n\nBut note: we have two known present letters. We need to find their positions. So testing N at index0 (which is a possibility) and I at index2 (which is also a possibility) is good.\n\nAlternatively, we can test I at index0? \n\nFor example, ""INKED"": I, N, K, E, D -> but E is absent.\n\n""INLAY"": I, N, L, A, Y -> L and A are absent.\n\n""INPUT"": I, N, P, U, T -> U and T are absent.\n\nSo it\'s hard to find a word with I at index0 and N at index1? But N cannot be at index1.\n\nHow about I at index0 and N at index2? \n  ""INDOL"": I, N, D, O, L -> but L is absent.\n\n""INDOW"": not a word.\n\n""INFIX"": I, N, F, I, X -> two I\'s? and X.\n\nSo maybe not.\n\nWhat about I at index4? \n  For example, ""TOWNI"" -> not a word.\n\n  ""BUNION"": too long.\n\n  ""UNION"" -> U is absent.\n\nSo it\'s challenging.\n\nTherefore, let\'s choose between ""NOISY"" and ""DINGY"".\n\nIn ""NOISY"", we are testing N at a position we haven\'t tried (index0) and I at index2 (which we haven\'t tried). Also, we are testing O, S, Y.\n\nIn ""DINGY"", we are testing I at index1 and N at index2, and D, G, Y.\n\nWe have more new letters to test? The more new letters we test, the better.\n\nBut note: we have already tested 10 letters (C,R,A,E,U,T,L from the first two guesses, plus N and I which are present). So 10 letters are known (either absent or present). There are 26 letters, so 16 left.\n\nWe want to cover as many as possible.\n\n""NOISY"" uses: N, O, I, S, Y -> 3 new letters: O, S, Y.\n""DINGY"" uses: D, I, N, G, Y -> 3 new letters: D, G, Y.\n\nSimilarly, ""WINDY"" uses W, I, N, D, Y -> 3 new: W, D, Y.\n\nBut we have to consider the positions.\n\nWe know that N must be at 0,2,4. We have tried N at 3 (in crane) and 1 (in until). Now we can try N at 0 (as in ""NOISY"") or at 2 (as in ""DINGY"", ""WINDY"", etc.). \n\nTrying N at 0 is a new position, so it might give us more information about the placement of N.\n\nSimilarly, for I, we have only tried it at index3 (in until).

We are given feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)
Meaning: 
  - C, R, A, E are absent.
  - N is present but not at position 4 (index 3).

Guess 2: ""until"" -> U(x), N(-), T(x), I(-), L(x)
Meaning:
  - U, T, L are absent.
  - N is present but not at position 2 (index 1).
  - I is present but not at position 4 (index 3).

Guess 3: ""noisy"" -> N(-), O(-), I(-), S(x), Y(x)
Meaning:
  - S, Y are absent.
  - N is present but not at position 1 (index 0) of ""noisy"". 
  - O is present but not at position 2 (index 1) of ""noisy"".
  - I is present but not at position 3 (index 2) of ""noisy"".

Therefore, we have:

Absent letters: C, R, A, E, U, T, L, S, Y

Present letters (but in wrong positions): N, O, I

We know:
- N has been tried at positions: index 3 (crane), index 1 (until), index 0 (noisy) -> all wrong. So N must be at either index 2 or index 4 (positions 3 or 5).
- I has been tried at: index 3 (until) and index 2 (noisy) -> both wrong. So I cannot be at index 2 or 3. Therefore, I must be at index 0, 1, or 4.
- O is present and has been tried at index 1 (noisy) -> wrong. So O cannot be at index 1. Possible positions for O: 0, 2, 3, 4.

We must choose a word that contains N, O, I, with the constraints on their positions, and uses two more letters from the remaining pool, avoiding absent letters.

Remaining letters (not absent and not one of N, O, I): B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

We also have to use one of these letters for the two additional spots? Actually, we need a 5-letter word with N, O, I and two other letters that are not absent.

Moreover, we must place:
- N: only at index 2 or 4 (positions 3 or 5).
- I: at index 0, 1, or 4 (positions 1, 2, or 5).
- O: not at index 1, so at 0, 2, 3, 4.

We have used 3 guesses, 3 tries left.

Now, let's form a word that contains all three (N, O, I) and two new letters. We have to avoid placing the letters in the disallowed positions.

Possible placements:

Let's try to put N at index 2 (position 3). Then, where can I and O go?
But we also have to assign positions for I and O without conflicting.

Alternatively, consider N at index 4 (position 5). Then we can assign I and O accordingly.

We need to consider words that fit.

Possible words:

Option: ""BINGO"" -> but we have B, I, N, G, O.
But note: in ""BINGO"":
  B at 0, I at 1, N at 2, G at 3, O at 4.

Now, check the constraints:
  For N: at index 2 -> allowed (since index 2 is one of 2 or 4).
  For I: at index 1 -> allowed (0,1,4 are allowed for I).
  For O: at index 4 -> allowed (since O cannot be at index 1, and index 4 is fine).

But we already guessed ""noisy"" and learned that O is present? Yes, so O is in the word.

But in ""BINGO"", we use B and G, which are new? Yes.

Moreover, we avoid all absent letters: C,R,A,E,U,T,L,S,Y are absent; B and G are not in that list.

So ""BINGO"" is a candidate.

But note: we tried N at index 2 in ""BINGO"". Is index 2 allowed for N? Yes, because we haven't tried index 2 for N? Actually, we did try N at index 2? In ""until"", N was at index 1 (position 2). In ""crane"", N at index 3 (position 4). In ""noisy"", N at index0 (position1). We haven't tried index2 (position3) for N. So it's new.

Similarly, I at index1: we haven't tried I at index1? Previously, I was at index3 (until) and index2 (noisy). So index1 is new.

O at index4: we tried O at index1 in ""noisy"", but index4 is new.

So let's go with ""BINGO"".

But wait: are there any issues? The word ""BINGO"" is valid.

Another candidate: ""DOING"" -> D, O, I, N, G.
Positions: 
  D (0), O (1), I (2), N (3), G (4)

Check constraints:
  N at index3 -> allowed? We know that N cannot be at index3? Let me check: initially from ""crane"", we learned that N is not at index3 (position4). Then from ""until"", N not at index1. From ""noisy"", N not at index0. We have to place N at either index2 or index4? Here it's at index3? But index3 was disallowed by the first guess: ""crane"" had N at index3 and got '-', meaning N is not at index3. So we cannot put N at index3.

Therefore, ""DOING"" would have N at index3 -> invalid.

What about ""GOING""? Same issue, N at index3.

Option with N at index4: for example, ""VODIN"" -> not a word.

""OVINE"": O, V, I, N, E -> but E is absent! So not allowed.

""ONION"": O, N, I, O, N -> repeated letters. And we have N at index1 and index4? But index1: we know N cannot be at index1. Also, positions not tested: 
  O at0, N at1 (invalid), I at2, O at3, N at4.

We cannot use N at index1.

Another: ""ICING"": I, C, I, N, G -> C is absent? Yes, we can't use C.

""MINOR"": M, I, N, O, R -> but R is absent? From guess1: R(x) -> absent. Not allowed.

""JOINT"": J, O, I, N, T -> T is absent? From guess2: T(x). Not allowed.

""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> T absent.

""QUINS"": Q, U, I, N, S -> U and S are absent.

So ""BINGO"" still seems good.

But in ""BINGO"":
  Positions: 
    B (0), I (1), N (2), G (3), O (4)

We know from the feedback of ""noisy"" for O: O was tried at index1 and got '-', meaning O is in the word but not at index1. In ""BINGO"", O is at index4 -> that's fine.

Similarly, I is at index1: we have tried I at index3 and index2 and they were wrong, but index1 for I was not tried yet. So it's possible.

N is at index2: previously N was at index3, then index1, then index0 -> index2 hasn't been tried.

So we'll use ""BINGO"".

But note: we have to ensure that the new letters B and G are not absent? They are not in the absent list.

Therefore, I'll guess ""BINGO"".

### Previous Feedback Analysis:
1. **Guess 1: crane** → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)  
   - Absent letters: **C, R, A, E**  
   - N is present but **not at position 4** (index 3).  
2. **Guess 2: until** → U(x), N(-), T(x), I(-), L(x)  
   - Absent letters: **U, T, L**  
   - N is present but **not at position 2** (index 1).  
   - I is present but **not at position 4** (index 3).  
3. **Guess 3: noisy** → N(-), O(-), I(-), S(x), Y(x)  
   - Absent letters: **S, Y**  
   - N is present but **not at position 1** (index 0).  
   - O is present but **not at position 2** (index 1).  
   - I is present but **not at position 3** (index 2).  

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed present letters**: N, I, O (all misplaced in previous guesses).  
- **Confirmed absent letters**: C, R, A, E, U, T, L, S, Y (9 letters total).  
- **Position constraints**:  
  - **N**: Not at positions 1 (index 0), 2 (index 1), or 4 (index 3). ∴ Must be at **position 3 or 5** (index 2 or 4).  
  - **I**: Not at positions 4 (index 3) or 3 (index 2). ∴ Must be at **position 1, 2, or 5** (index 0, 1, or 4).  
  - **O**: Not at position 2 (index 1). ∴ Can be at position 1, 3, 4, or 5 (index 0, 2, 3, or 4).  
- **Remaining letters**: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (14 letters).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Must include **N, I, O** (all confirmed present) and avoid all absent letters.  
- Assign positions for N, I, O that adhere to constraints:  
  - Prioritize **untried positions**:  
    - N: Not tried at index 2 or 4 → test **index 2** (position 3).  
    - I: Not tried at index 0, 1, or 4 → test **index 1** (position 2).  
    - O: Not tried at index 0, 2, 3, or 4 → test **index 4** (position 5).  
- Use **new common letters** (B, G) for remaining positions to maximize information.  

### Selected Word: **BINGO**
- **B** (index 0): New letter → tests B (position 1).  
- **I** (index 1): Allowed position for I → if correct, confirms position; if wrong, eliminates position 2.  
- **N** (index 2): Allowed position for N → tests position 3.  
- **G** (index 3): New letter → tests G (position 4).  
- **O** (index 4): Allowed position for O → tests position 5.  

This guess efficiently tests new positions for N, I, O and letters B/G while adhering to constraints.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. These are all frequent in English words.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in word)
 R: x (not in word)
 A: x (not in word)
 N: - (in word but wrong position)
 E: x (not in word)

 Therefore, we know:
 - The letter N is present in the secret word, but it's not in the 4th position (since in ""crane"" N is the 4th letter).
 - The letters C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.

 We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
   Does not contain C, R, A, E (they are absent).
   Contains the letter N, but not in the 4th position.

 Since we only have one letter so far (N), we want to pick a word that uses common letters not yet tested, and includes N in a position other than 4.

 Let's think about common letters left. The alphabet without C, R, A, E: 
   B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We also know the word has N. We should avoid repeating the positions we already tried? Actually, we only know that N is not at position 4 (index 3, if we count 0-indexed).

 Let's generate a word that meets the criteria and uses common letters. We want to cover new letters.

 Possible choices: Consider words with N in positions 0, 1, 2, or 4 (if 5-letter word, positions: 0,1,2,3,4). Remember ""crane"" had N at position 3 (which is index 3). So we must not put N at index 3 again.

 We are going to avoid letters we know are absent: C, R, A, E.

 Some words that come to mind:
   OTHERS? But it's 6 letters -> too long.
   We need 5-letter words.

 Think: 
   Using common consonants and vowels that are left. Vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out). But we don't have many vowels? Actually, A and E are out, so we have I, O, U, and sometimes Y.

 Example words:
   ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T. 
      - Contains N and places it at the 3rd position (index 3). But wait, our last guess had N at index 3. The feedback said N is in the word but not at that position, so we must avoid putting N at index 3 again? Actually, no: the feedback only said the position was wrong, so N could be in the word in another position. But if we put N again at index 3, it would be incorrect, so we want to move it. So in ""POINT"", N is at index 3, same as before? Then we should avoid.

   Let's try putting N at a different index.

   How about ""LINTS"": L, I, N, T, S -> N is at index 2? That's different from index 3.

   But wait, we also have to avoid the absent letters. We know C, R, A, E are absent, and ""LINTS"" doesn't have these.

   However, we must ensure we are using valid English words.

   Alternative: ""JOINT"" -> J, O, I, N, T -> N at index 3 again. So same problem.

   Instead, let's try ""SONIC"": 
      S, O, N, I, C -> but C is absent! We know C is out, so we cannot use C.

   ""POINT"" uses O, I, and P, T. But we are avoiding putting N at index 3.

   We need words that have N at index 0, 1, 2, or 4.

   Index 0: ""NOISE""? N at 0. Then O, I, S, E -> but E is absent! We can't use E.

   Index 1: How about ""UNLIT""? U, N, L, I, T -> N at index 1. Letters: U (vowel), N, L, I (vowel), T. 
      We haven't tested U, L, I, T. But note: E is avoided? Yes, no E. Also no C, R, A.

   However, we must make sure the word is valid. ""UNLIT"" is a word? It means not lit, but let me check - it should be acceptable.

   Another possibility: ""INPUT""? I, N, P, U, T -> N at index 1. But I at index 0? That's acceptable. And no forbidden letters.

   ""GUILD""? G, U, I, L, D -> this word doesn't have an N? So must have N.

   How about ""BUNCH""? B, U, N, C, H -> C is forbidden, so no.

   Let's aim for: N at index 1: 
      Words: 
         UNTIL: U, N, T, I, L -> yes, and it's a valid word. 
         UNFIT: U, N, F, I, T -> valid.

   Also N at index 2: 
         MINTS: M, I, N, T, S -> valid? M, I, N, T, S -> and no forbidden letters.

   Let's choose one with letters we haven't tested to maximize information.

   In ""UNTIL"": 
      Letters: U, N, T, I, L -> we have U (new), T (new), I (new), L (new) and N (we know has appeared).

   In ""MINTS"": M, I, N, T, S -> M, I, T, S are new.

   Either is fine. But note we must avoid the absent letters.

   Another word: ""POINT"" is no due to same N position? Actually, let's clarify: The feedback said N is in the word but not at position 3 (the fourth letter). So if we put N at position 3 again, it will be incorrect because the secret word doesn't have N at position 3. Therefore, we must avoid position 3 for N? Exactly.

   Therefore, we should avoid using N at index 3.

   So ""POINT"" places N at index 3 -> invalid? Because we know N isn't there. So it would be a wasted guess.

   Therefore, let's go with ""UNTIL"": U (new), N (must be at a different position -> index 1 here), T (new), I (new), L (new). 

   Alternatively, if we want to test S, we can choose ""MINTS"". Both are good.

   We haven't tested S in the previous guess? Actually, in ""crane"" we didn't have S. So S is a common letter we haven't tried.

   Moreover, ""MINTS"" has N at index 2, which is a new position.

   Let's try ""MINTS"". It leaves out the letter U, but we can test S. 

   But we also want to use vowels? The word must have vowels? The secret word has at least one vowel? Not necessarily vowels are A, E, I, O, U. Since A and E are absent, the vowel must be I, O, or U? 

   We haven't tested O either. 

   However, ""MINTS"" uses I as a vowel.

   Another candidate: ""POULT"" -> P, O, U, L, T? But no N.

   How about ""MOUNT"": M, O, U, N, T -> This has N at index 3? Position 4 (index 3) -> but that's the same position as before? So we must avoid. Not good.

   ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T -> no N. Won't work.

   ""JOINS"": J, O, I, N, S -> N at index 3? Same problem.

   So let's stick with a word that places N at a new position and uses common letters.

   After considering, I think ""UNTIL"" might be a good candidate: 
        Position 0: U -> not tested
        Position 1: N -> known to be in word (but not at index 3, so this is a new position)
        Position 2: T -> new
        Position 3: I -> new
        Position 4: L -> new

   But note: the secret word might have N at any position except 3. Therefore, placing at 1 is good.

   Alternatively, ""MINTS"" has N at index 2. We can do that too.

   Let's choose ""UNTIL"" because it tests more vowels? We have U and I.

   However, we have another option: ""POUND"" -> P, O, U, N, D -> N at index 3? No, because positions: 
        P (0), O (1), U (2), N (3), D (4) -> index 3! We have to avoid.

   So avoid words that put N at index 3.

   ""DUNKS"": D, U, N, K, S -> N at index 2? Actually: 
        D index0, U index1, N index2 -> that's acceptable.

   But we haven't tested D, U, K, S.

   But ""DUNKS"" is valid? Yes.

   However, let me check: We are constrained by the absence of C, R, A, E, so words without these are allowed.

   Considering commonality and possibility to get more information, let's choose a word that has different vowels and consonants.

   Given the above, I'll choose ""UNTIL"": 
        U (vowel), N (known), T (consonant), I (vowel), L (consonant)

   We'll see what feedback gives.

   Alternatively, if we want to avoid using two vowels in one guess? It's okay.

   Let's go with ""UNTIL"".

   So second guess: ""UNTIL""

   But note: we must make sure the word is in the dictionary. Assuming ""until"" is valid.

   If we are concerned about double letters? We don't see any.

   Therefore, my second guess is ""until"".

<guess>until</guess>Based on the previous feedback from ""crane"": 
- C, R, A, E are not in the word at all (marked 'x')
- N is in the word but not in position 4 (marked '-'), meaning it must appear elsewhere

For the next guess:
- Must include N (since it’s confirmed present)
- N cannot be in position 4/index 3 again (from ""crane"")
- Avoid C, R, A, E entirely
- Prioritize common unused letters (e.g., consonants like T, L, S and vowels like I, O, U)

The word ""until"" meets all criteria:
- Contains N in position 2 (index 1), avoiding position 4
- Uses new letters U, T, I, L (all untested in the first guess)
- No forbidden letters (C, R, A, E)

This guess maximizes information by testing four new letters and strategically placing N in a new position.

<guess>until</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: until -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) T(x) I(-) L(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)
Meaning:
  - C, R, A, E are absent (not in the word at all)
  - N is present but not in the 4th position (index 3)

Guess 2: ""until"" -> U(x), N(-), T(x), I(-), L(x)
Meaning:
  - U, T, L are absent (not in the word at all)
  - N is present but not in the 2nd position (index 1) -> because in ""until"", N is at index 1 and we got a '-', meaning it's in the word but not there.
  - I is present but not in the 4th position (index 3) -> because in ""until"", I is at index 3 and we got a '-'

So now we know:

Absent letters: C, R, A, E, U, T, L

Present letters (but position unknown): N and I

We also know that N is not at index 1 (from ""until"") and not at index 3 (from ""crane""). Similarly, I is not at index 3 (from ""until"").

Since the word is 5 letters, the possible positions for N are: 0, 2, 4 (indices 0, 2, 4) because 1 and 3 are ruled out.

Similarly, I can be at positions 0, 1, 2, 4 (since only index 3 is ruled out).

We must choose a word that:
  - Contains N and I (since they are present)
  - Does not contain any of the absent letters: C, R, A, E, U, T, L
  - Places N in one of the positions: 0, 2, 4 (but not 1 or 3)
  - Places I in a position that is not 3 (so 0,1,2,4) but note we don't know the position of I yet.

Additionally, we want to test new letters to get more information.

The remaining letters (not absent and not yet known to be present) are:
  B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z

But we also have the two known present letters: N and I.

We have 6 tries, and we've used 2, so we have 4 left.

We need to form a 5-letter word that includes N and I, and three other letters from the remaining set, avoiding the absent ones.

We also note that the word must be a valid English word.

Let's think of words that have both N and I, and use common letters from the remaining set.

Possible words:

Option 1: ""POINT"" -> but T is absent (from guess 2: T(x)), so we cannot use T. Also, N is at index 3? But we know N cannot be at index 3. And in ""POINT"", N is at index 3 -> invalid. Also, T is absent.

Option 2: ""JOINS"" -> J, O, I, N, S. 
  - N is at index 3 -> which is forbidden (we know N is not at index 3). So invalid.

Option 3: ""MINIS"" -> M, I, N, I, S -> but has two I's? Also, N is at index 2 -> that's allowed (index 2 is one of 0,2,4). But we have two I's? The word ""minis"" is valid (plural of mini). However, we don't know if the secret word has two I's? It might. But let's check the feedback: in ""until"", we had one I and it was marked present but wrong position. That doesn't rule out two I's. But we have to avoid absent letters: M, I, N, I, S -> no absent letters? M, S are new, I and N are present. But we have two I's? We don't know if that's allowed. However, the feedback for ""until"" only had one I and it was present, but if the word has two I's, then we might get two marks? But we don't know. So ""minis"" is a possibility.

But let's see the positions:
  M at 0, I at 1, N at 2, I at 3, S at 4.
  We know I cannot be at index 3? Because in ""until"", I was at index 3 and we got a '-' meaning it's present but not at that position. So if the secret word has only one I, then we cannot put I at index 3. But if it has two I's, then one of them might be at index 3? Actually, the feedback for ""until"" only tells us that there is at least one I that is not at index 3. It doesn't say anything about a second I. So it's possible that the secret word has an I at index 3? But wait, the feedback for ""until"" at index 3 was I and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means that the I at index 3 is not in the correct position, but if there is another I in the word, that one might be in a correct position? Actually, the feedback doesn't specify which occurrence. But in Wordle, if a letter is repeated, the feedback can be tricky.

However, note that in ""until"", we had one I and it was at index 3. The feedback for that I was '-' meaning: the letter I is in the word but not at this position. So that implies that there is at least one I in the word that is not at index 3. It does not say anything about whether there is an I at index 3? Actually, if the word had an I at index 3, then that I would have been marked as correct (a check) because it's in the right position. But it was marked as '-' meaning that the I at index 3 is not in the right position. Therefore, the secret word does not have an I at index 3. So we can rule out I at index 3.

Therefore, in ""minis"", the I at index 3 would be incorrect (because we know the secret word doesn't have I at index 3) and the I at index 1 might be correct? But we don't know. However, we are allowed to use two I's? But we are trying to test.

But note: we have to avoid using absent letters. We don't know if the word has two I's. But we do know that at least one I is present. So using two I's is acceptable.

But let's see: the word ""minis"" has I at index 1 and index 3. We know index 3 is invalid for I, so the I at index 3 will be marked as either:
   - If the secret word has two I's, then the I at index 3 might be marked as '-' (if there is another I that is not at index 3) or if the secret word has only one I, then the I at index 3 would be marked as 'x'? Actually, no: if the secret word has only one I and we have two I's in the guess, then one of them (the one that is in the correct position) would be marked, and the other would be marked as 'x' if the secret word doesn't have two. But we don't know.

However, we are trying to get information. But we also have to consider that we are limited by the absent letters.

Alternatively, we can avoid using two I's to reduce complexity.

Let me try to find a word with one I and one N, and three new letters.

Possible words:

- ""DINGY"": D, I, N, G, Y -> but D, G, Y are new. 
  Positions: I at index 1, N at index 2 -> both positions are allowed for I and N? 
  For I: we know it cannot be at index 3, but index 1 is allowed. 
  For N: index 2 is allowed (since we have 0,2,4). 
  But we have to check if D, G, Y are allowed? They are not in the absent list.

  However, we have to make sure the word is valid. ""DINGY"" is valid.

- ""WINDY"": W, I, N, D, Y -> similar: I at 1, N at 2. Also valid.

- ""PINKY"": P, I, N, K, Y -> I at 1, N at 2.

But note: we haven't tested D, G, W, P, K, Y, etc.

Another option: ""SINCE"" -> but E is absent. Not allowed.

""MINDS"": M, I, N, D, S -> I at 1, N at 2. This is good.

But we have to avoid T? Yes, T is absent, but ""MINDS"" doesn't have T.

We also have ""HINGE"" -> but E is absent.

""BINGO"": B, I, N, G, O -> I at 1, N at 2. Valid.

""JINGO"": J, I, N, G, O -> same.

Now, we also have the possibility of placing N at index 0 or 4.

For example, ""NOISY"": N, O, I, S, Y -> 
  N at index 0 -> allowed (since not 1 or 3). 
  I at index 2 -> allowed (not 3). 
  But O, S, Y are new.

But ""NOISY"" is valid.

Similarly, ""NOISY"" uses common letters.

Another: ""NOXIS"" -> not a common word.

Or ""INBOX"": I, N, B, O, X -> 
  I at 0, N at 1 -> but wait, N at index 1: we know from ""until"" that N is not at index 1. So we cannot put N at index 1. 
  Therefore, ""INBOX"" has N at index 1 -> invalid.

Similarly, we must avoid N at index 1 and 3.

So for N, only indices 0, 2, 4.

In ""NOISY"": N at 0 -> good.

We can also have N at 4: for example, ""RAINY"" -> but R and A are absent. Not allowed.

""MAINS"": M, A, I, N, S -> A is absent.

""COINS"": C and O, I, N, S -> C is absent.

""JOINS"": N at index 3 -> invalid.

So words with N at 4: 
  ""TOWN"" is 4 letters? We need 5.

  ""TOWNS"": T is absent.

  ""DOWNS"": D, O, W, N, S -> N at 4? 
      D (0), O (1), W (2), N (3)? Wait, that's index 3 -> not allowed.

  How about ""OWING"": O, W, I, N, G -> N at index 4? 
      O(0), W(1), I(2), N(3)? -> index 3 -> not allowed.

  ""AXION"": A is absent.

  ""ZION"" is 4 letters.

  ""BEGIN"": B, E, G, I, N -> E is absent.

  ""BLINI"": B, L, I, N, I -> L is absent.

  ""KININ"": K, I, N, I, N -> but we have two I's and two N's? And we don't know if the word has multiple. But also, we have to avoid absent letters: L is absent? In ""BLINI"", L is absent, but ""KININ"" doesn't have L. However, we have two I's and two N's? The word ""kinin"" is a valid word (a compound). 
      Positions: I at index 1 and 3? But we know I cannot be at index 3. So if we put I at index 3, it will be wrong. 
      Also, N at index 2 and 4? We know N cannot be at index 3, but index 2 and 4 are allowed. 
      But the word: K(0), I(1), N(2), I(3), N(4). 
      The I at index 3 is invalid. So we would get a '-' for the first I? and then for the second I at index 3, we would get an 'x'? Actually, the feedback might be: 
          The first I (index1) might be correct or not, and the second I (index3) is definitely wrong (because we know the secret word doesn't have I at index3). But if the secret word has only one I, then the second I would be marked as absent? 

  This might be confusing.

  So to avoid complexity, let's try to use words without repeated letters.

Therefore, let's go back to words with one I and one N, and no repeated letters.

We have:

- ""DINGY"": D, I, N, G, Y -> I at 1, N at 2.
- ""WINDY"": W, I, N, D, Y -> I at 1, N at 2.
- ""PINKY"": P, I, N, K, Y -> I at 1, N at 2.
- ""MINDS"": M, I, N, D, S -> I at 1, N at 2.
- ""BINGO"": B, I, N, G, O -> I at 1, N at 2.
- ""NOISY"": N, O, I, S, Y -> N at 0, I at 2.

We also have ""NOISY"" which places N at 0 and I at 2.

We want to maximize the information. In ""NOISY"", we are testing N at a new position (index0) and I at index2 (which is new). Also, we are testing O, S, Y.

In the other words, we are testing I at index1 and N at index2, which are both new positions for I and N.

But note: we have two known present letters. We need to find their positions. So testing N at index0 (which is a possibility) and I at index2 (which is also a possibility) is good.

Alternatively, we can test I at index0? 

For example, ""INKED"": I, N, K, E, D -> but E is absent.

""INLAY"": I, N, L, A, Y -> L and A are absent.

""INPUT"": I, N, P, U, T -> U and T are absent.

So it's hard to find a word with I at index0 and N at index1? But N cannot be at index1.

How about I at index0 and N at index2? 
  ""INDOL"": I, N, D, O, L -> but L is absent.

""INDOW"": not a word.

""INFIX"": I, N, F, I, X -> two I's? and X.

So maybe not.

What about I at index4? 
  For example, ""TOWNI"" -> not a word.

  ""BUNION"": too long.

  ""UNION"" -> U is absent.

So it's challenging.

Therefore, let's choose between ""NOISY"" and ""DINGY"".

In ""NOISY"", we are testing N at a position we haven't tried (index0) and I at index2 (which we haven't tried). Also, we are testing O, S, Y.

In ""DINGY"", we are testing I at index1 and N at index2, and D, G, Y.

We have more new letters to test? The more new letters we test, the better.

But note: we have already tested 10 letters (C,R,A,E,U,T,L from the first two guesses, plus N and I which are present). So 10 letters are known (either absent or present). There are 26 letters, so 16 left.

We want to cover as many as possible.

""NOISY"" uses: N, O, I, S, Y -> 3 new letters: O, S, Y.
""DINGY"" uses: D, I, N, G, Y -> 3 new letters: D, G, Y.

Similarly, ""WINDY"" uses W, I, N, D, Y -> 3 new: W, D, Y.

But we have to consider the positions.

We know that N must be at 0,2,4. We have tried N at 3 (in crane) and 1 (in until). Now we can try N at 0 (as in ""NOISY"") or at 2 (as in ""DINGY"", ""WINDY"", etc.). 

Trying N at 0 is a new position, so it might give us more information about the placement of N.

Similarly, for I, we have only tried it at index3 (in until). We know it's not at 3. So we can try it at 0,1,2,4. In ""NOISY"", we try I at index2. In ""DINGY"", we try I at index1.

Both are new positions for I.

So both are good.

But let's pick ""NOISY"" because it tests a new position for N (index0) and also tests S and O which are common.

So I'll go with ""NOISY"".

Therefore, the third guess is ""NOISY"".

<guess>noisy</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Absent Letters**: C, R, A, E, U, T, L (confirmed not in the word)
- **Present Letters (wrong position)**: N and I (must appear in the word, but not at the positions previously guessed)
  - N cannot be at position 4 (from ""crane"") or position 2 (from ""until""), so possible positions: 1, 3, or 5 (1-indexed, i.e., indices 0, 2, or 4).
  - I cannot be at position 4 (from ""until""), so possible positions: 1, 2, 3, or 5 (indices 0, 1, 2, or 4).

For the next guess:
- Must include **N** and **I**.
- Avoid all absent letters (C, R, A, E, U, T, L).
- Test new common letters (e.g., O, S, Y) to maximize information.
- Place N and I in new, untried positions to narrow down their locations.

The word **""NOISY""** fits perfectly:
- **N** at position 1 (index 0) → tests a new position for N (previously untried).
- **I** at position 3 (index 2) → tests a new position for I (previously only tried at position 4).
- **O, S, Y** are new, common letters not yet tested.
- No repeated or absent letters.

This guess efficiently tests key possibilities for N and I while covering three new letters.

<guess>noisy</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: until -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) T(x) I(-) L(x)
Guess 3: noisy -> FEEDBACK: N(-) O(-) I(-) S(x) Y(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)
Meaning: 
  - C, R, A, E are absent.
  - N is present but not at position 4 (index 3).

Guess 2: ""until"" -> U(x), N(-), T(x), I(-), L(x)
Meaning:
  - U, T, L are absent.
  - N is present but not at position 2 (index 1).
  - I is present but not at position 4 (index 3).

Guess 3: ""noisy"" -> N(-), O(-), I(-), S(x), Y(x)
Meaning:
  - S, Y are absent.
  - N is present but not at position 1 (index 0) of ""noisy"". 
  - O is present but not at position 2 (index 1) of ""noisy"".
  - I is present but not at position 3 (index 2) of ""noisy"".

Therefore, we have:

Absent letters: C, R, A, E, U, T, L, S, Y

Present letters (but in wrong positions): N, O, I

We know:
- N has been tried at positions: index 3 (crane), index 1 (until), index 0 (noisy) -> all wrong. So N must be at either index 2 or index 4 (positions 3 or 5).
- I has been tried at: index 3 (until) and index 2 (noisy) -> both wrong. So I cannot be at index 2 or 3. Therefore, I must be at index 0, 1, or 4.
- O is present and has been tried at index 1 (noisy) -> wrong. So O cannot be at index 1. Possible positions for O: 0, 2, 3, 4.

We must choose a word that contains N, O, I, with the constraints on their positions, and uses two more letters from the remaining pool, avoiding absent letters.

Remaining letters (not absent and not one of N, O, I): B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

We also have to use one of these letters for the two additional spots? Actually, we need a 5-letter word with N, O, I and two other letters that are not absent.

Moreover, we must place:
- N: only at index 2 or 4 (positions 3 or 5).
- I: at index 0, 1, or 4 (positions 1, 2, or 5).
- O: not at index 1, so at 0, 2, 3, 4.

We have used 3 guesses, 3 tries left.

Now, let's form a word that contains all three (N, O, I) and two new letters. We have to avoid placing the letters in the disallowed positions.

Possible placements:

Let's try to put N at index 2 (position 3). Then, where can I and O go?
But we also have to assign positions for I and O without conflicting.

Alternatively, consider N at index 4 (position 5). Then we can assign I and O accordingly.

We need to consider words that fit.

Possible words:

Option: ""BINGO"" -> but we have B, I, N, G, O.
But note: in ""BINGO"":
  B at 0, I at 1, N at 2, G at 3, O at 4.

Now, check the constraints:
  For N: at index 2 -> allowed (since index 2 is one of 2 or 4).
  For I: at index 1 -> allowed (0,1,4 are allowed for I).
  For O: at index 4 -> allowed (since O cannot be at index 1, and index 4 is fine).

But we already guessed ""noisy"" and learned that O is present? Yes, so O is in the word.

But in ""BINGO"", we use B and G, which are new? Yes.

Moreover, we avoid all absent letters: C,R,A,E,U,T,L,S,Y are absent; B and G are not in that list.

So ""BINGO"" is a candidate.

But note: we tried N at index 2 in ""BINGO"". Is index 2 allowed for N? Yes, because we haven't tried index 2 for N? Actually, we did try N at index 2? In ""until"", N was at index 1 (position 2). In ""crane"", N at index 3 (position 4). In ""noisy"", N at index0 (position1). We haven't tried index2 (position3) for N. So it's new.

Similarly, I at index1: we haven't tried I at index1? Previously, I was at index3 (until) and index2 (noisy). So index1 is new.

O at index4: we tried O at index1 in ""noisy"", but index4 is new.

So let's go with ""BINGO"".

But wait: are there any issues? The word ""BINGO"" is valid.

Another candidate: ""DOING"" -> D, O, I, N, G.
Positions: 
  D (0), O (1), I (2), N (3), G (4)

Check constraints:
  N at index3 -> allowed? We know that N cannot be at index3? Let me check: initially from ""crane"", we learned that N is not at index3 (position4). Then from ""until"", N not at index1. From ""noisy"", N not at index0. We have to place N at either index2 or index4? Here it's at index3? But index3 was disallowed by the first guess: ""crane"" had N at index3 and got '-', meaning N is not at index3. So we cannot put N at index3.

Therefore, ""DOING"" would have N at index3 -> invalid.

What about ""GOING""? Same issue, N at index3.

Option with N at index4: for example, ""VODIN"" -> not a word.

""OVINE"": O, V, I, N, E -> but E is absent! So not allowed.

""ONION"": O, N, I, O, N -> repeated letters. And we have N at index1 and index4? But index1: we know N cannot be at index1. Also, positions not tested: 
  O at0, N at1 (invalid), I at2, O at3, N at4.

We cannot use N at index1.

Another: ""ICING"": I, C, I, N, G -> C is absent? Yes, we can't use C.

""MINOR"": M, I, N, O, R -> but R is absent? From guess1: R(x) -> absent. Not allowed.

""JOINT"": J, O, I, N, T -> T is absent? From guess2: T(x). Not allowed.

""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> T absent.

""QUINS"": Q, U, I, N, S -> U and S are absent.

So ""BINGO"" still seems good.

But in ""BINGO"":
  Positions: 
    B (0), I (1), N (2), G (3), O (4)

We know from the feedback of ""noisy"" for O: O was tried at index1 and got '-', meaning O is in the word but not at index1. In ""BINGO"", O is at index4 -> that's fine.

Similarly, I is at index1: we have tried I at index3 and index2 and they were wrong, but index1 for I was not tried yet. So it's possible.

N is at index2: previously N was at index3, then index1, then index0 -> index2 hasn't been tried.

So we'll use ""BINGO"".

But note: we have to ensure that the new letters B and G are not absent? They are not in the absent list.

Therefore, I'll guess ""BINGO"".

<guess>bingo</guess>### Previous Feedback Analysis:
1. **Guess 1: crane** → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)  
   - Absent letters: **C, R, A, E**  
   - N is present but **not at position 4** (index 3).  
2. **Guess 2: until** → U(x), N(-), T(x), I(-), L(x)  
   - Absent letters: **U, T, L**  
   - N is present but **not at position 2** (index 1).  
   - I is present but **not at position 4** (index 3).  
3. **Guess 3: noisy** → N(-), O(-), I(-), S(x), Y(x)  
   - Absent letters: **S, Y**  
   - N is present but **not at position 1** (index 0).  
   - O is present but **not at position 2** (index 1).  
   - I is present but **not at position 3** (index 2).  

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed present letters**: N, I, O (all misplaced in previous guesses).  
- **Confirmed absent letters**: C, R, A, E, U, T, L, S, Y (9 letters total).  
- **Position constraints**:  
  - **N**: Not at positions 1 (index 0), 2 (index 1), or 4 (index 3). ∴ Must be at **position 3 or 5** (index 2 or 4).  
  - **I**: Not at positions 4 (index 3) or 3 (index 2). ∴ Must be at **position 1, 2, or 5** (index 0, 1, or 4).  
  - **O**: Not at position 2 (index 1). ∴ Can be at position 1, 3, 4, or 5 (index 0, 2, 3, or 4).  
- **Remaining letters**: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (14 letters).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Must include **N, I, O** (all confirmed present) and avoid all absent letters.  
- Assign positions for N, I, O that adhere to constraints:  
  - Prioritize **untried positions**:  
    - N: Not tried at index 2 or 4 → test **index 2** (position 3).  
    - I: Not tried at index 0, 1, or 4 → test **index 1** (position 2).  
    - O: Not tried at index 0, 2, 3, or 4 → test **index 4** (position 5).  
- Use **new common letters** (B, G) for remaining positions to maximize information.  

### Selected Word: **BINGO**
- **B** (index 0): New letter → tests B (position 1).  
- **I** (index 1): Allowed position for I → if correct, confirms position; if wrong, eliminates position 2.  
- **N** (index 2): Allowed position for N → tests position 3.  
- **G** (index 3): New letter → tests G (position 4).  
- **O** (index 4): Allowed position for O → tests position 5.  

This guess efficiently tests new positions for N, I, O and letters B/G while adhering to constraints.

The alphabet without C, R, A, E: \n   B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n We also know the word has N. We should avoid repeating the positions we already tried? Actually, we only know that N is not at position 4 (index 3, if we count 0-indexed).\n\n Let\'s generate a word that meets the criteria and uses common letters. We want to cover new letters.\n\n Possible choices: Consider words with N in positions 0, 1, 2, or 4 (if 5-letter word, positions: 0,1,2,3,4). Remember ""crane"" had N at position 3 (which is index 3). So we must not put N at index 3 again.\n\n We are going to avoid letters we know are absent: C, R, A, E.\n\n Some words that come to mind:\n   OTHERS? But it\'s 6 letters -> too long.\n   We need 5-letter words.\n\n Think: \n   Using common consonants and vowels that are left. Vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out). But we don\'t have many vowels? Actually, A and E are out, so we have I, O, U, and sometimes Y.\n\n Example words:\n   ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T. \n      - Contains N and places it at the 3rd position (index 3). But wait, our last guess had N at index 3. The feedback said N is in the word but not at that position, so we must avoid putting N at index 3 again? Actually, no: the feedback only said the position was wrong, so N could be in the word in another position. But if we put N again at index 3, it would be incorrect, so we want to move it. So in ""POINT"", N is at index 3, same as before? Then we should avoid.\n\n   Let\'s try putting N at a different index.\n\n   How about ""LINTS"": L, I, N, T, S -> N is at index 2? That\'s different from index 3.\n\n   But wait, we also have to avoid the absent letters. We know C, R, A, E are absent, and ""LINTS"" doesn\'t have these.\n\n   However, we must ensure we are using valid English words.\n\n   Alternative: ""JOINT"" -> J, O, I, N, T -> N at index 3 again. So same problem.\n\n   Instead, let\'s try ""SONIC"": \n      S, O, N, I, C -> but C is absent! We know C is out, so we cannot use C.\n\n   ""POINT"" uses O, I, and P, T. But we are avoiding putting N at index 3.\n\n   We need words that have N at index 0, 1, 2, or 4.\n\n   Index 0: ""NOISE""? N at 0. Then O, I, S, E -> but E is absent! We can\'t use E.\n\n   Index 1: How about ""UNLIT""? U, N, L, I, T -> N at index 1. Letters: U (vowel), N, L, I (vowel), T. \n      We haven\'t tested U, L, I, T. But note: E is avoided? Yes, no E. Also no C, R, A.\n\n   However, we must make sure the word is valid. ""UNLIT"" is a word? It means not lit, but let me check - it should be acceptable.\n\n   Another possibility: ""INPUT""? I, N, P, U, T -> N at index 1. But I at index 0? That\'s acceptable. And no forbidden letters.\n\n   ""GUILD""? G, U, I, L, D -> this word doesn\'t have an N? So must have N.\n\n   How about ""BUNCH""? B, U, N, C, H -> C is forbidden, so no.\n\n   Let\'s aim for: N at index 1: \n      Words: \n         UNTIL: U, N, T, I, L -> yes, and it\'s a valid word. \n         UNFIT: U, N, F, I, T -> valid.\n\n   Also N at index 2: \n         MINTS: M, I, N, T, S -> valid? M, I, N, T, S -> and no forbidden letters.\n\n   Let\'s choose one with letters we haven\'t tested to maximize information.\n\n   In ""UNTIL"": \n      Letters: U, N, T, I, L -> we have U (new), T (new), I (new), L (new) and N (we know has appeared).\n\n   In ""MINTS"": M, I, N, T, S -> M, I, T, S are new.\n\n   Either is fine. But note we must avoid the absent letters.\n\n   Another word: ""POINT"" is no due to same N position? Actually, let\'s clarify: The feedback said N is in the word but not at position 3 (the fourth letter). So if we put N at position 3 again, it will be incorrect because the secret word doesn\'t have N at position 3. Therefore, we must avoid position 3 for N? Exactly.\n\n   Therefore, we should avoid using N at index 3.\n\n   So ""POINT"" places N at index 3 -> invalid? Because we know N isn\'t there. So it would be a wasted guess.\n\n   Therefore, let\'s go with ""UNTIL"": U (new), N (must be at a different position -> index 1 here), T (new), I (new), L (new). \n\n   Alternatively, if we want to test S, we can choose ""MINTS"". Both are good.\n\n   We haven\'t tested S in the previous guess? Actually, in ""crane"" we didn\'t have S. So S is a common letter we haven\'t tried.\n\n   Moreover, ""MINTS"" has N at index 2, which is a new position.\n\n   Let\'s try ""MINTS"". It leaves out the letter U, but we can test S. \n\n   But we also want to use vowels? The word must have vowels? The secret word has at least one vowel? Not necessarily vowels are A, E, I, O, U. Since A and E are absent, the vowel must be I, O, or U? \n\n   We haven\'t tested O either. \n\n   However, ""MINTS"" uses I as a vowel.\n\n   Another candidate: ""POULT"" -> P, O, U, L, T? But no N.\n\n   How about ""MOUNT"": M, O, U, N, T -> This has N at index 3? Position 4 (index 3) -> but that\'s the same position as before? So we must avoid. Not good.\n\n   ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T -> no N. Won\'t work.\n\n   ""JOINS"": J, O, I, N, S -> N at index 3? Same problem.\n\n   So let\'s stick with a word that places N at a new position and uses common letters.\n\n   After considering, I think ""UNTIL"" might be a good candidate: \n        Position 0: U -> not tested\n        Position 1: N -> known to be in word (but not at index 3, so this is a new position)\n        Position 2: T -> new\n        Position 3: I -> new\n        Position 4: L -> new\n\n   But note: the secret word might have N at any position except 3. Therefore, placing at 1 is good.\n\n   Alternatively, ""MINTS"" has N at index 2. We can do that too.\n\n   Let\'s choose ""UNTIL"" because it tests more vowels? We have U and I.\n\n   However, we have another option: ""POUND"" -> P, O, U, N, D -> N at index 3? No, because positions: \n        P (0), O (1), U (2), N (3), D (4) -> index 3! We have to avoid.\n\n   So avoid words that put N at index 3.\n\n   ""DUNKS"": D, U, N, K, S -> N at index 2? Actually: \n        D index0, U index1, N index2 -> that\'s acceptable.\n\n   But we haven\'t tested D, U, K, S.\n\n   But ""DUNKS"" is valid? Yes.\n\n   However, let me check: We are constrained by the absence of C, R, A, E, so words without these are allowed.\n\n   Considering commonality and possibility to get more information, let\'s choose a word that has different vowels and consonants.\n\n   Given the above, I\'ll choose ""UNTIL"": \n        U (vowel), N (known), T (consonant), I (vowel), L (consonant)\n\n   We\'ll see what feedback gives.\n\n   Alternatively, if we want to avoid using two vowels in one guess? It\'s okay.\n\n   Let\'s go with ""UNTIL"".\n\n   So second guess: ""UNTIL""\n\n   But note: we must make sure the word is in the dictionary. Assuming ""until"" is valid.\n\n   If we are concerned about double letters? We don\'t see any.\n\n   Therefore, my second guess is ""until"".\n\n<guess>until</guess>Based on the previous feedback from ""crane"": \n- C, R, A, E are not in the word at all (marked \'x\')\n- N is in the word but not in position 4 (marked \'-\'), meaning it must appear elsewhere\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include N (since it’s confirmed present)\n- N cannot be in position 4/index 3 again (from ""crane"")\n- Avoid C, R, A, E entirely\n- Prioritize common unused letters (e.g., consonants like T, L, S and vowels like I, O, U)\n\nThe word ""until"" meets all criteria:\n- Contains N in position 2 (index 1), avoiding position 4\n- Uses new letters U, T, I, L (all untested in the first guess)\n- No forbidden letters (C, R, A, E)\n\nThis guess maximizes information by testing four new letters and strategically placing N in a new position.\n\n<guess>until</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: until -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) T(x) I(-) L(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from the first two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)\nMeaning:\n  - C, R, A, E are absent (not in the word at all)\n  - N is present but not in the 4th position (index 3)\n\nGuess 2: ""until"" -> U(x), N(-), T(x), I(-), L(x)\nMeaning:\n  - U, T, L are absent (not in the word at all)\n  - N is present but not in the 2nd position (index 1) -> because in ""until"", N is at index 1 and we got a \'-\', meaning it\'s in the word but not there.\n  - I is present but not in the 4th position (index 3) -> because in ""until"", I is at index 3 and we got a \'-\'\n\nSo now we know:\n\nAbsent letters: C, R, A, E, U, T, L\n\nPresent letters (but position unknown): N and I\n\nWe also know that N is not at index 1 (from ""until"") and not at index 3 (from ""crane""). Similarly, I is not at index 3 (from ""until"").\n\nSince the word is 5 letters, the possible positions for N are: 0, 2, 4 (indices 0, 2, 4) because 1 and 3 are ruled out.\n\nSimilarly, I can be at positions 0, 1, 2, 4 (since only index 3 is ruled out).\n\nWe must choose a word that:\n  - Contains N and I (since they are present)\n  - Does not contain any of the absent letters: C, R, A, E, U, T, L\n  - Places N in one of the positions: 0, 2, 4 (but not 1 or 3)\n  - Places I in a position that is not 3 (so 0,1,2,4) but note we don\'t know the position of I yet.\n\nAdditionally, we want to test new letters to get more information.\n\nThe remaining letters (not absent and not yet known to be present) are:\n  B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nBut we also have the two known present letters: N and I.\n\nWe have 6 tries, and we\'ve used 2, so we have 4 left.\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that includes N and I, and three other letters from the remaining set, avoiding the absent ones.\n\nWe also note that the word must be a valid English word.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have both N and I, and use common letters from the remaining set.\n\nPossible words:\n\nOption 1: ""POINT"" -> but T is absent (from guess 2: T(x)), so we cannot use T. Also, N is at index 3? But we know N cannot be at index 3. And in ""POINT"", N is at index 3 -> invalid. Also, T is absent.\n\nOption 2: ""JOINS"" -> J, O, I, N, S. \n  - N is at index 3 -> which is forbidden (we know N is not at index 3). So invalid.\n\nOption 3: ""MINIS"" -> M, I, N, I, S -> but has two I\'s? Also, N is at index 2 -> that\'s allowed (index 2 is one of 0,2,4). But we have two I\'s? The word ""minis"" is valid (plural of mini). However, we don\'t know if the secret word has two I\'s? It might. But let\'s check the feedback: in ""until"", we had one I and it was marked present but wrong position. That doesn\'t rule out two I\'s. But we have to avoid absent letters: M, I, N, I, S -> no absent letters? M, S are new, I and N are present. But we have two I\'s? We don\'t know if that\'s allowed. However, the feedback for ""until"" only had one I and it was present, but if the word has two I\'s, then we might get two marks? But we don\'t know. So ""minis"" is a possibility.\n\nBut let\'s see the positions:\n  M at 0, I at 1, N at 2, I at 3, S at 4.\n  We know I cannot be at index 3? Because in ""until"", I was at index 3 and we got a \'-\' meaning it\'s present but not at that position. So if the secret word has only one I, then we cannot put I at index 3. But if it has two I\'s, then one of them might be at index 3? Actually, the feedback for ""until"" only tells us that there is at least one I that is not at index 3. It doesn\'t say anything about a second I. So it\'s possible that the secret word has an I at index 3? But wait, the feedback for ""until"" at index 3 was I and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means that the I at index 3 is not in the correct position, but if there is another I in the word, that one might be in a correct position? Actually, the feedback doesn\'t specify which occurrence. But in Wordle, if a letter is repeated, the feedback can be tricky.\n\nHowever, note that in ""until"", we had one I and it was at index 3. The feedback for that I was \'-\' meaning: the letter I is in the word but not at this position. So that implies that there is at least one I in the word that is not at index 3. It does not say anything about whether there is an I at index 3? Actually, if the word had an I at index 3, then that I would have been marked as correct (a check) because it\'s in the right position. But it was marked as \'-\' meaning that the I at index 3 is not in the right position. Therefore, the secret word does not have an I at index 3. So we can rule out I at index 3.\n\nTherefore, in ""minis"", the I at index 3 would be incorrect (because we know the secret word doesn\'t have I at index 3) and the I at index 1 might be correct? But we don\'t know. However, we are allowed to use two I\'s? But we are trying to test.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid using absent letters. We don\'t know if the word has two I\'s. But we do know that at least one I is present. So using two I\'s is acceptable.\n\nBut let\'s see: the word ""minis"" has I at index 1 and index 3. We know index 3 is invalid for I, so the I at index 3 will be marked as either:\n   - If the secret word has two I\'s, then the I at index 3 might be marked as \'-\' (if there is another I that is not at index 3) or if the secret word has only one I, then the I at index 3 would be marked as \'x\'? Actually, no: if the secret word has only one I and we have two I\'s in the guess, then one of them (the one that is in the correct position) would be marked, and the other would be marked as \'x\' if the secret word doesn\'t have two. But we don\'t know.\n\nHowever, we are trying to get information. But we also have to consider that we are limited by the absent letters.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid using two I\'s to reduce complexity.\n\nLet me try to find a word with one I and one N, and three new letters.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""DINGY"": D, I, N, G, Y -> but D, G, Y are new. \n  Positions: I at index 1, N at index 2 -> both positions are allowed for I and N? \n  For I: we know it cannot be at index 3, but index 1 is allowed. \n  For N: index 2 is allowed (since we have 0,2,4). \n  But we have to check if D, G, Y are allowed? They are not in the absent list.\n\n  However, we have to make sure the word is valid. ""DINGY"" is valid.\n\n- ""WINDY"": W, I, N, D, Y -> similar: I at 1, N at 2. Also valid.\n\n- ""PINKY"": P, I, N, K, Y -> I at 1, N at 2.\n\nBut note: we haven\'t tested D, G, W, P, K, Y, etc.\n\nAnother option: ""SINCE"" -> but E is absent. Not allowed.\n\n""MINDS"": M, I, N, D, S -> I at 1, N at 2. This is good.\n\nBut we have to avoid T? Yes, T is absent, but ""MINDS"" doesn\'t have T.\n\nWe also have ""HINGE"" -> but E is absent.\n\n""BINGO"": B, I, N, G, O -> I at 1, N at 2. Valid.\n\n""JINGO"": J, I, N, G, O -> same.\n\nNow, we also have the possibility of placing N at index 0 or 4.\n\nFor example, ""NOISY"": N, O, I, S, Y -> \n  N at index 0 -> allowed (since not 1 or 3). \n  I at index 2 -> allowed (not 3). \n  But O, S, Y are new.\n\nBut ""NOISY"" is valid.\n\nSimilarly, ""NOISY"" uses common letters.\n\nAnother: ""NOXIS"" -> not a common word.\n\nOr ""INBOX"": I, N, B, O, X -> \n  I at 0, N at 1 -> but wait, N at index 1: we know from ""until"" that N is not at index 1. So we cannot put N at index 1. \n  Therefore, ""INBOX"" has N at index 1 -> invalid.\n\nSimilarly, we must avoid N at index 1 and 3.\n\nSo for N, only indices 0, 2, 4.\n\nIn ""NOISY"": N at 0 -> good.\n\nWe can also have N at 4: for example, ""RAINY"" -> but R and A are absent. Not allowed.\n\n""MAINS"": M, A, I, N, S -> A is absent.\n\n""COINS"": C and O, I, N, S -> C is absent.\n\n""JOINS"": N at index 3 -> invalid.\n\nSo words with N at 4: \n  ""TOWN"" is 4 letters? We need 5.\n\n  ""TOWNS"": T is absent.\n\n  ""DOWNS"": D, O, W, N, S -> N at 4? \n      D (0), O (1), W (2), N (3)? Wait, that\'s index 3 -> not allowed.\n\n  How about ""OWING"": O, W, I, N, G -> N at index 4? \n      O(0), W(1), I(2), N(3)? -> index 3 -> not allowed.\n\n  ""AXION"": A is absent.\n\n  ""ZION"" is 4 letters.\n\n  ""BEGIN"": B, E, G, I, N -> E is absent.\n\n  ""BLINI"": B, L, I, N, I -> L is absent.\n\n  ""KININ"": K, I, N, I, N -> but we have two I\'s and two N\'s? And we don\'t know if the word has multiple. But also, we have to avoid absent letters: L is absent? In ""BLINI"", L is absent, but ""KININ"" doesn\'t have L. However, we have two I\'s and two N\'s? The word ""kinin"" is a valid word (a compound). \n      Positions: I at index 1 and 3? But we know I cannot be at index 3. So if we put I at index 3, it will be wrong. \n      Also, N at index 2 and 4? We know N cannot be at index 3, but index 2 and 4 are allowed. \n      But the word: K(0), I(1), N(2), I(3), N(4). \n      The I at index 3 is invalid. So we would get a \'-\' for the first I? and then for the second I at index 3, we would get an \'x\'? Actually, the feedback might be: \n          The first I (index1) might be correct or not, and the second I (index3) is definitely wrong (because we know the secret word doesn\'t have I at index3). But if the secret word has only one I, then the second I would be marked as absent? \n\n  This might be confusing.\n\n  So to avoid complexity, let\'s try to use words without repeated letters.\n\nTherefore, let\'s go back to words with one I and one N, and no repeated letters.\n\nWe have:\n\n- ""DINGY"": D, I, N, G, Y -> I at 1, N at 2.\n- ""WINDY"": W, I, N, D, Y -> I at 1, N at 2.\n- ""PINKY"": P, I, N, K, Y -> I at 1, N at 2.\n- ""MINDS"": M, I, N, D, S -> I at 1, N at 2.\n- ""BINGO"": B, I, N, G, O -> I at 1, N at 2.\n- ""NOISY"": N, O, I, S, Y -> N at 0, I at 2.\n\nWe also have ""NOISY"" which places N at 0 and I at 2.\n\nWe want to maximize the information. In ""NOISY"", we are testing N at a new position (index0) and I at index2 (which is new). Also, we are testing O, S, Y.\n\nIn the other words, we are testing I at index1 and N at index2, which are both new positions for I and N.\n\nBut note: we have two known present letters. We need to find their positions. So testing N at index0 (which is a possibility) and I at index2 (which is also a possibility) is good.\n\nAlternatively, we can test I at index0? \n\nFor example, ""INKED"": I, N, K, E, D -> but E is absent.\n\n""INLAY"": I, N, L, A, Y -> L and A are absent.\n\n""INPUT"": I, N, P, U, T -> U and T are absent.\n\nSo it\'s hard to find a word with I at index0 and N at index1? But N cannot be at index1.\n\nHow about I at index0 and N at index2? \n  ""INDOL"": I, N, D, O, L -> but L is absent.\n\n""INDOW"": not a word.\n\n""INFIX"": I, N, F, I, X -> two I\'s? and X.\n\nSo maybe not.\n\nWhat about I at index4? \n  For example, ""TOWNI"" -> not a word.\n\n  ""BUNION"": too long.\n\n  ""UNION"" -> U is absent.\n\nSo it\'s challenging.\n\nTherefore, let\'s choose between ""NOISY"" and ""DINGY"".\n\nIn ""NOISY"", we are testing N at a position we haven\'t tried (index0) and I at index2 (which we haven\'t tried). Also, we are testing O, S, Y.\n\nIn ""DINGY"", we are testing I at index1 and N at index2, and D, G, Y.\n\nWe have more new letters to test? The more new letters we test, the better.\n\nBut note: we have already tested 10 letters (C,R,A,E,U,T,L from the first two guesses, plus N and I which are present). So 10 letters are known (either absent or present). There are 26 letters, so 16 left.\n\nWe want to cover as many as possible.\n\n""NOISY"" uses: N, O, I, S, Y -> 3 new letters: O, S, Y.\n""DINGY"" uses: D, I, N, G, Y -> 3 new letters: D, G, Y.\n\nSimilarly, ""WINDY"" uses W, I, N, D, Y -> 3 new: W, D, Y.\n\nBut we have to consider the positions.\n\nWe know that N must be at 0,2,4. We have tried N at 3 (in crane) and 1 (in until). Now we can try N at 0 (as in ""NOISY"") or at 2 (as in ""DINGY"", ""WINDY"", etc.). \n\nTrying N at 0 is a new position, so it might give us more information about the placement of N.\n\nSimilarly, for I, we have only tried it at index3 (in until). We know it\'s not at 3. So we can try it at 0,1,2,4. In ""NOISY"", we try I at index2. In ""DINGY"", we try I at index1.\n\nBoth are new positions for I.\n\nSo both are good.\n\nBut let\'s pick ""NOISY"" because it tests a new position for N (index0) and also tests S and O which are common.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""NOISY"".\n\nTherefore, the third guess is ""NOISY"".\n\n<guess>noisy</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Absent Letters**: C, R, A, E, U, T, L (confirmed not in the word)\n- **Present Letters (wrong position)**: N and I (must appear in the word, but not at the positions previously guessed)\n  - N cannot be at position 4 (from ""crane"") or position 2 (from ""until""), so possible positions: 1, 3, or 5 (1-indexed, i.e., indices 0, 2, or 4).\n  - I cannot be at position 4 (from ""until""), so possible positions: 1, 2, 3, or 5 (indices 0, 1, 2, or 4).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **N** and **I**.\n- Avoid all absent letters (C, R, A, E, U, T, L).\n- Test new common letters (e.g., O, S, Y) to maximize information.\n- Place N and I in new, untried positions to narrow down their locations.\n\nThe word **""NOISY""** fits perfectly:\n- **N** at position 1 (index 0) → tests a new position for N (previously untried).\n- **I** at position 3 (index 2) → tests a new position for I (previously only tried at position 4).\n- **O, S, Y** are new, common letters not yet tested.\n- No repeated or absent letters.\n\nThis guess efficiently tests key possibilities for N and I while covering three new letters.\n\n<guess>noisy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: until -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) T(x) I(-) L(x)\nGuess 3: noisy -> FEEDBACK: N(-) O(-) I(-) S(x) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)\nMeaning: \n  - C, R, A, E are absent.\n  - N is present but not at position 4 (index 3).\n\nGuess 2: ""until"" -> U(x), N(-), T(x), I(-), L(x)\nMeaning:\n  - U, T, L are absent.\n  - N is present but not at position 2 (index 1).\n  - I is present but not at position 4 (index 3).\n\nGuess 3: ""noisy"" -> N(-), O(-), I(-), S(x), Y(x)\nMeaning:\n  - S, Y are absent.\n  - N is present but not at position 1 (index 0) of ""noisy"". \n  - O is present but not at position 2 (index 1) of ""noisy"".\n  - I is present but not at position 3 (index 2) of ""noisy"".\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\nAbsent letters: C, R, A, E, U, T, L, S, Y\n\nPresent letters (but in wrong positions): N, O, I\n\nWe know:\n- N has been tried at positions: index 3 (crane), index 1 (until), index 0 (noisy) -> all wrong. So N must be at either index 2 or index 4 (positions 3 or 5).\n- I has been tried at: index 3 (until) and index 2 (noisy) -> both wrong. So I cannot be at index 2 or 3. Therefore, I must be at index 0, 1, or 4.\n- O is present and has been tried at index 1 (noisy) -> wrong. So O cannot be at index 1. Possible positions for O: 0, 2, 3, 4.\n\nWe must choose a word that contains N, O, I, with the constraints on their positions, and uses two more letters from the remaining pool, avoiding absent letters.\n\nRemaining letters (not absent and not one of N, O, I): B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z\n\nWe also have to use one of these letters for the two additional spots? Actually, we need a 5-letter word with N, O, I and two other letters that are not absent.\n\nMoreover, we must place:\n- N: only at index 2 or 4 (positions 3 or 5).\n- I: at index 0, 1, or 4 (positions 1, 2, or 5).\n- O: not at index 1, so at 0, 2, 3, 4.\n\nWe have used 3 guesses, 3 tries left.\n\nNow, let\'s form a word that contains all three (N, O, I) and two new letters. We have to avoid placing the letters in the disallowed positions.\n\nPossible placements:\n\nLet\'s try to put N at index 2 (position 3). Then, where can I and O go?\nBut we also have to assign positions for I and O without conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, consider N at index 4 (position 5). Then we can assign I and O accordingly.\n\nWe need to consider words that fit.\n\nPossible words:\n\nOption: ""BINGO"" -> but we have B, I, N, G, O.\nBut note: in ""BINGO"":\n  B at 0, I at 1, N at 2, G at 3, O at 4.\n\nNow, check the constraints:\n  For N: at index 2 -> allowed (since index 2 is one of 2 or 4).\n  For I: at index 1 -> allowed (0,1,4 are allowed for I).\n  For O: at index 4 -> allowed (since O cannot be at index 1, and index 4 is fine).\n\nBut we already guessed ""noisy"" and learned that O is present? Yes, so O is in the word.\n\nBut in ""BINGO"", we use B and G, which are new? Yes.\n\nMoreover, we avoid all absent letters: C,R,A,E,U,T,L,S,Y are absent; B and G are not in that list.\n\nSo ""BINGO"" is a candidate.\n\nBut note: we tried N at index 2 in ""BINGO"". Is index 2 allowed for N? Yes, because we haven\'t tried index 2 for N? Actually, we did try N at index 2? In ""until"", N was at index 1 (position 2). In ""crane"", N at index 3 (position 4). In ""noisy"", N at index0 (position1). We haven\'t tried index2 (position3) for N. So it\'s new.\n\nSimilarly, I at index1: we haven\'t tried I at index1? Previously, I was at index3 (until) and index2 (noisy). So index1 is new.\n\nO at index4: we tried O at index1 in ""noisy"", but index4 is new.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""BINGO"".\n\nBut wait: are there any issues? The word ""BINGO"" is valid.\n\nAnother candidate: ""DOING"" -> D, O, I, N, G.\nPositions: \n  D (0), O (1), I (2), N (3), G (4)\n\nCheck constraints:\n  N at index3 -> allowed? We know that N cannot be at index3? Let me check: initially from ""crane"", we learned that N is not at index3 (position4). Then from ""until"", N not at index1. From ""noisy"", N not at index0. We have to place N at either index2 or index4? Here it\'s at index3? But index3 was disallowed by the first guess: ""crane"" had N at index3 and got \'-\', meaning N is not at index3. So we cannot put N at index3.\n\nTherefore, ""DOING"" would have N at index3 -> invalid.\n\nWhat about ""GOING""? Same issue, N at index3.\n\nOption with N at index4: for example, ""VODIN"" -> not a word.\n\n""OVINE"": O, V, I, N, E -> but E is absent! So not allowed.\n\n""ONION"": O, N, I, O, N -> repeated letters. And we have N at index1 and index4? But index1: we know N cannot be at index1. Also, positions not tested: \n  O at0, N at1 (invalid), I at2, O at3, N at4.\n\nWe cannot use N at index1.\n\nAnother: ""ICING"": I, C, I, N, G -> C is absent? Yes, we can\'t use C.\n\n""MINOR"": M, I, N, O, R -> but R is absent? From guess1: R(x) -> absent. Not allowed.\n\n""JOINT"": J, O, I, N, T -> T is absent? From guess2: T(x). Not allowed.\n\n""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> T absent.\n\n""QUINS"": Q, U, I, N, S -> U and S are absent.\n\nSo ""BINGO"" still seems good.\n\nBut in ""BINGO"":\n  Positions: \n    B (0), I (1), N (2), G (3), O (4)\n\nWe know from the feedback of ""noisy"" for O: O was tried at index1 and got \'-\', meaning O is in the word but not at index1. In ""BINGO"", O is at index4 -> that\'s fine.\n\nSimilarly, I is at index1: we have tried I at index3 and index2 and they were wrong, but index1 for I was not tried yet. So it\'s possible.\n\nN is at index2: previously N was at index3, then index1, then index0 -> index2 hasn\'t been tried.\n\nSo we\'ll use ""BINGO"".\n\nBut note: we have to ensure that the new letters B and G are not absent? They are not in the absent list.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll guess ""BINGO"".\n\n<guess>bingo</guess>### Previous Feedback Analysis:\n1. **Guess 1: crane** → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)  \n   - Absent letters: **C, R, A, E**  \n   - N is present but **not at position 4** (index 3).  \n2. **Guess 2: until** → U(x), N(-), T(x), I(-), L(x)  \n   - Absent letters: **U, T, L**  \n   - N is present but **not at position 2** (index 1).  \n   - I is present but **not at position 4** (index 3).  \n3. **Guess 3: noisy** → N(-), O(-), I(-), S(x), Y(x)  \n   - Absent letters: **S, Y**  \n   - N is present but **not at position 1** (index 0).  \n   - O is present but **not at position 2** (index 1).  \n   - I is present but **not at position 3** (index 2).  \n\n### Key Insights:\n- **Confirmed present letters**: N, I, O (all misplaced in previous guesses).  \n- **Confirmed absent letters**: C, R, A, E, U, T, L, S, Y (9 letters total).  \n- **Position constraints**:  \n  - **N**: Not at positions 1 (index 0), 2 (index 1), or 4 (index 3). ∴ Must be at **position 3 or 5** (index 2 or 4).  \n  - **I**: Not at positions 4 (index 3) or 3 (index 2). ∴ Must be at **position 1, 2, or 5** (index 0, 1, or 4).  \n  - **O**: Not at position 2 (index 1). ∴ Can be at position 1, 3, 4, or 5 (index 0, 2, 3, or 4).  \n- **Remaining letters**: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (14 letters).  \n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- Must include **N, I, O** (all confirmed present) and avoid all absent letters.  \n- Assign positions for N, I, O that adhere to constraints:  \n  - Prioritize **untried positions**:  \n    - N: Not tried at index 2 or 4 → test **index 2** (position 3).  \n    - I: Not tried at index 0, 1, or 4 → test **index 1** (position 2).  \n    - O: Not tried at index 0, 2, 3, or 4 → test **index 4** (position 5).  \n- Use **new common letters** (B, G) for remaining positions to maximize information.  \n\n### Selected Word: **BINGO**\n- **B** (index 0): New letter → tests B (position 1).  \n- **I** (index 1): Allowed position for I → if correct, confirms position; if wrong, eliminates position 2.  \n- **N** (index 2): Allowed position for N → tests position 3.  \n- **G** (index 3): New letter → tests G (position 4).  \n- **O** (index 4): Allowed position for O → tests position 5.  \n\nThis guess efficiently tests new positions for N, I, O and letters B/G while adhering to constraints.\n\n<guess>bingo</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: until -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) T(x) I(-) L(x)\nGuess 3: noisy -> FEEDBACK: N(-) O(-) I(-) S(x) Y(x)\nGuess 4: bingo -> FEEDBACK: B(x) I(✓) N(✓) G(✓) O(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback for the fourth guess ""bingo"": 
  B(x) I(✓) N(✓) G(✓) O(✓)

This means:
  - B is absent (not in the word)
  - I is correct at position 2 (index 1): so secret word has I at the second position.
  - N is correct at position 3 (index 2): so secret word has N at the third position.
  - G is correct at position 4 (index 3): so secret word has G at the fourth position.
  - O is correct at position 5 (index 4): so secret word has O at the fifth position.

Therefore, the secret word has: 
  second letter: I
  third letter: N
  fourth letter: G
  fifth letter: O

And we know the first letter is missing: we don't have it yet.

From feedback, the known pattern: _ I N G O

We also know that the first letter cannot be one of the absent letters.

Absent letters from previous feedbacks: 
  Guess1: C, R, A, E
  Guess2: U, T, L
  Guess3: S, Y
  Guess4: B

So absent letters: C, R, A, E, U, T, L, S, Y, B

We also know that from guess3, O was present (but misplaced at index1), and now we have it at index4 correctly.

Similarly, N and I were present and now are correctly placed.

We still need to guess the first letter. The first letter must be a letter that is not in the absent list and hasn't been confirmed yet.

The potential candidates: letters from the remaining alphabet that are not absent.

Remaining letters: D, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need to choose a word that fits: ? I N G O

We don't need the other letters, we just need to try different first letters until we find the word.

But note: the word must be a valid English word.

Possible words: 
  With the pattern _INGO:

Common English words ending with ""INGO"" are rare. 

Actually, ""INGO"" is not a common ending. Perhaps ""BINGO"" is one, but B is absent. 

We need to consider words that end with ""INGO"". 

Examples: 
  ""DINGO"": but D is possible? We haven't tested D. 
      D is not in the absent list. So it could be ""DINGO"".
  ""JINGO"": J not absent -> possible.
  ""MINGO"": Not a common word? But ""MINGO"" as in flamingo? But flamingo is 7 letters.
  ""TINGO"": T is absent -> not allowed.
  ""WINGO"": Not a standard word.

Therefore, the most likely candidates are ""DINGO"" and ""JINGO"".

We have ""DINGO"" as a valid word: a wild dog.

""JINGO"": meaning a person who is excessively aggressive in patriotism.

But we have to note: in the fourth guess, we guessed ""BINGO"", which gave us the correct positions for I, N, G, O and told us B is absent. So if the secret word were ""JINGO"", then when we guessed ""BINGO"", the feedback would have been:
  B: absent (x) -> correct because JINGO doesn't have B.
  I: present and correct (✓)
  N: present and correct (✓)
  G: present and correct (✓)
  O: present and correct (✓)

So that fits.

Similarly, ""DINGO"" would also fit: 
  ""BINGO"" vs ""DINGO"": 
      B vs D: different -> B would be absent? Yes.

But note: we only have one guess left? We have used 4 guesses, so we have 2 tries left? Actually, the game allows 6 tries, so 2 left.

But we can try to guess the full word now.

Alternatively, we might want to guess a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we already have four positions fixed: second, third, fourth, fifth letters are I, N, G, O.

So any remaining possibility for the first letter can be tested by trying a word with that letter.

But we have two tries. We can try ""DINGO"" and then if not, try ""JINGO"". But if we try ""DINGO"" and it's correct, we win. If not, then the word is ""JINGO"".

But wait: are there other possibilities?

Consider the words: ""HINGO""? HINGO is not a valid English word? I don't recall it.

Similarly, ""KINGO"" – not a word. 
  ""PINGO"": a geological term? Valid?
  ""PINGO"" is accepted as a word in some dictionaries: a mound of earth covered ice.

But we haven't tested P? Not absent.

So the possibilities: ""DINGO"", ""JINGO"", ""PINGO"".

Given we only have two guesses left, we can try ""DINGO"" first and if it fails, then we try the other? But we must try one now.

Is there a word that includes more than one possibility? Not really, because we only have one letter to guess.

So we can try the most common word: ""DINGO"" might be more common than ""JINGO"" or ""PINGO"".

Alternatively, recall the first guess: ""crane"" had N marked as present but wrong position. In ""DINGO"" or ""JINGO"" or ""PINGO"", the N is at position 3 (index 2). In the first guess ""crane"", N was at index3 (position4). So if the secret word has N at position3, why was it not marked as correct? Because in ""crane"", N was at position4 and the secret word's N is at position3? So not the same position. Then it would be marked as '-' which it was. So it's consistent.

Similarly, all these words don't have R, A, E, etc.

We haven't tested D, J, P.

In the third guess ""noisy"", O was misplaced: in the secret word it is at position5, in ""noisy"" it was at position2? So that's why it was marked '-'.

Similarly, I was at position2 in ""noisy""? But the secret word has I at position2? Actually, in ""noisy"" we put I at index2? And we got '-'. But if the secret word has I at index1? Then it would be marked as 'x'? Because the position of I in ""noisy"" is index2? But wait, the secret word has I at index1? And in ""noisy"" we put I at index2? 

But now we know the secret word has I at index1? Exactly: pattern: _ I N G O -> index1: I.

But in ""noisy"", the guess was: 
  position1: N? No, 
  noisy: positions: 
      0: N
      1: O
      2: I
      3: S
      4: Y

And the word has I at index1? But ""noisy"" had O at index1 and I at index2? The secret word has I at index1? And O at index4? 

In the third guess feedback: I was marked '-', meaning I is in the word but not at that position. But the secret word has I at index1? So when ""noisy"" placed I at index2, it should have been marked as '-' because the I is in the word (at index1) but not at the position guessed? Yes. So the feedback was correct.

Therefore, the words are ""DINGO"", ""JINGO"", ""PINGO"". 

There's also ""VINGO""? Not a word. ""ZINGO""? Not common.

So we must pick one. Given we don't have other constraints, let's choose the most common.

We have two guesses left. We can try one and then the other? But that uses both guesses? How about we try to get it in one?

Alternatively, we can guess a word that uses the remaining letters? But we have only the first letter changing.

However, we have already confirmed the positions of I, N, G, O. So if we guess ""DINGO"", it's either correct or not? If not, the word must be ""JINGO"" or ""PINGO"". Then we have one guess left.

But if we guess ""JINGO"" first? Same situation.

But note: we have not guessed any of D, J, P in past words? We can pick arbitrarily.

Given the letter frequency: D is more common? So perhaps the word is ""DINGO"".

But also, in the context we started with ""crane"", which was a bad guess? 

But let me note: we have 2 guesses left, so we can risk one.

I'll go with ""DINGO"".

So the fifth guess is ""DINGO"".

If the secret word is ""DINGO"", we get it. If not, we'll know it must be ""JINGO"" or ""PINGO"" and guess accordingly next.

But for now, guess ""DINGO"".

### Key Insights:
- **Secret word pattern**: `[?] I N G O`  
- **Confirmed absent letters (10 total)**: C, R, A, E, U, T, L, S, Y, B.  
- **Remaining possible letters for first position**: D, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.  
- **Possible words**: Must be valid 5-letter words matching `_ I N G O`. Common options:  
  - **DINGO** (valid → wild dog),  
  - **JINGO** (valid → aggressive patriot),  
  - **PINGO** (valid → ice-cored hill).  

### Strategy:
- With **2 tries left**, prioritize the most common valid word: **DINGO**.  
- If incorrect, the next guess will be **JINGO** or **PINGO** (depending on new feedback).  

<guess>dingo</guess>",dingo,"We have feedback for the fourth guess ""bingo"":

This means:
  - B is absent (not in the word)
  - I is correct at position 2 (index 1): so secret word has I at the second position.
  - N is correct at position 3 (index 2): so secret word has N at the third position.
  - G is correct at position 4 (index 3): so secret word has G at the fourth position.
  - O is correct at position 5 (index 4): so secret word has O at the fifth position.

Therefore, the secret word has: 
  second letter: I
  third letter: N
  fourth letter: G
  fifth letter: O

And we know the first letter is missing: we don't have it yet.

From feedback, the known pattern: _ I N G O

We also know that the first letter cannot be one of the absent letters.

Absent letters from previous feedbacks: 
  Guess1: C, R, A, E
  Guess2: U, T, L
  Guess3: S, Y
  Guess4: B

So absent letters: C, R, A, E, U, T, L, S, Y, B

We also know that from guess3, O was present (but misplaced at index1), and now we have it at index4 correctly.

Similarly, N and I were present and now are correctly placed.

We still need to guess the first letter. The first letter must be a letter that is not in the absent list and hasn't been confirmed yet.

The potential candidates: letters from the remaining alphabet that are not absent.

Remaining letters: D, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need to choose a word that fits: ? I N G O

We don't need the other letters, we just need to try different first letters until we find the word.

But note: the word must be a valid English word.

Possible words: 
  With the pattern _INGO:

Common English words ending with ""INGO"" are rare. 

Actually, ""INGO"" is not a common ending. Perhaps ""BINGO"" is one, but B is absent. 

We need to consider words that end with ""INGO"". 

Examples: 
  ""DINGO"": but D is possible? We haven't tested D. 
      D is not in the absent list. So it could be ""DINGO"".
  ""JINGO"": J not absent -> possible.
  ""MINGO"": Not a common word? But ""MINGO"" as in flamingo? But flamingo is 7 letters.
  ""TINGO"": T is absent -> not allowed.
  ""WINGO"": Not a standard word.

Therefore, the most likely candidates are ""DINGO"" and ""JINGO"".

We have ""DINGO"" as a valid word: a wild dog.

""JINGO"": meaning a person who is excessively aggressive in patriotism.

But we have to note: in the fourth guess, we guessed ""BINGO"", which gave us the correct positions for I, N, G, O and told us B is absent. So if the secret word were ""JINGO"", then when we guessed ""BINGO"", the feedback would have been:
  B: absent (x) -> correct because JINGO doesn't have B.
  I: present and correct (✓)
  N: present and correct (✓)
  G: present and correct (✓)
  O: present and correct (✓)

So that fits.

Similarly, ""DINGO"" would also fit: 
  ""BINGO"" vs ""DINGO"": 
      B vs D: different -> B would be absent? Yes.

But note: we only have one guess left? We have used 4 guesses, so we have 2 tries left? Actually, the game allows 6 tries, so 2 left.

But we can try to guess the full word now.

Alternatively, we might want to guess a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we already have four positions fixed: second, third, fourth, fifth letters are I, N, G, O.

So any remaining possibility for the first letter can be tested by trying a word with that letter.

But we have two tries. We can try ""DINGO"" and then if not, try ""JINGO"". But if we try ""DINGO"" and it's correct, we win. If not, then the word is ""JINGO"".

But wait: are there other possibilities?

Consider the words: ""HINGO""? HINGO is not a valid English word? I don't recall it.

Similarly, ""KINGO"" – not a word. 
  ""PINGO"": a geological term? Valid?
  ""PINGO"" is accepted as a word in some dictionaries: a mound of earth covered ice.

But we haven't tested P? Not absent.

So the possibilities: ""DINGO"", ""JINGO"", ""PINGO"".

Given we only have two guesses left, we can try ""DINGO"" first and if it fails, then we try the other? But we must try one now.

Is there a word that includes more than one possibility? Not really, because we only have one letter to guess.

So we can try the most common word: ""DINGO"" might be more common than ""JINGO"" or ""PINGO"".

Alternatively, recall the first guess: ""crane"" had N marked as present but wrong position. In ""DINGO"" or ""JINGO"" or ""PINGO"", the N is at position 3 (index 2). In the first guess ""crane"", N was at index3 (position4). So if the secret word has N at position3, why was it not marked as correct? Because in ""crane"", N was at position4 and the secret word's N is at position3? So not the same position. Then it would be marked as '-' which it was. So it's consistent.

Similarly, all these words don't have R, A, E, etc.

We haven't tested D, J, P.

In the third guess ""noisy"", O was misplaced: in the secret word it is at position5, in ""noisy"" it was at position2? So that's why it was marked '-'.

Similarly, I was at position2 in ""noisy""? But the secret word has I at position2? Actually, in ""noisy"" we put I at index2? And we got '-'. But if the secret word has I at index1? Then it would be marked as 'x'? Because the position of I in ""noisy"" is index2? But wait, the secret word has I at index1? And in ""noisy"" we put I at index2? 

But now we know the secret word has I at index1? Exactly: pattern: _ I N G O -> index1: I.

But in ""noisy"", the guess was: 
  position1: N? No, 
  noisy: positions: 
      0: N
      1: O
      2: I
      3: S
      4: Y

And the word has I at index1? But ""noisy"" had O at index1 and I at index2? The secret word has I at index1? And O at index4? 

In the third guess feedback: I was marked '-', meaning I is in the word but not at that position. But the secret word has I at index1? So when ""noisy"" placed I at index2, it should have been marked as '-' because the I is in the word (at index1) but not at the position guessed? Yes. So the feedback was correct.

Therefore, the words are ""DINGO"", ""JINGO"", ""PINGO"". 

There's also ""VINGO""? Not a word. ""ZINGO""? Not common.

So we must pick one. Given we don't have other constraints, let's choose the most common.

We have two guesses left. We can try one and then the other? But that uses both guesses? How about we try to get it in one?

Alternatively, we can guess a word that uses the remaining letters? But we have only the first letter changing.

However, we have already confirmed the positions of I, N, G, O. So if we guess ""DINGO"", it's either correct or not? If not, the word must be ""JINGO"" or ""PINGO"". Then we have one guess left.

But if we guess ""JINGO"" first? Same situation.

But note: we have not guessed any of D, J, P in past words? We can pick arbitrarily.

Given the letter frequency: D is more common? So perhaps the word is ""DINGO"".

But also, in the context we started with ""crane"", which was a bad guess? 

But let me note: we have 2 guesses left, so we can risk one.

I'll go with ""DINGO"".

So the fifth guess is ""DINGO"".

If the secret word is ""DINGO"", we get it. If not, we'll know it must be ""JINGO"" or ""PINGO"" and guess accordingly next.

But for now, guess ""DINGO"".
