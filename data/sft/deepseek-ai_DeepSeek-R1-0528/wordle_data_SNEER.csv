We are starting the game. We need to make our first guess. Since we have no prior information, we should choose a word that covers common letters.
Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N).
A good starting word might be one that includes several common letters.

One of the popular starting words in Wordle is ""CRANE"" because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). Another is ""SLATE"". However, note that we don't have any constraints.

Let me think of a word that includes a mix of vowels and common consonants. Here are a few options:
- CRANE: letters C, R, A, N, E
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E
- RAISE: R, A, I, S, E

I'll go with ""RAISE"" because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This might give good coverage.

Alternatively, we can use ""ROATE"" (which is an anagram of ORATE) but that is less common. I think ""RAISE"" is a solid choice.

So, my first guess: RAISE

We are given feedback for the first guess ""raise"":
- R: (-) meaning R is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A: (x) meaning A is not in the word.
- I: (x) meaning I is not in the word.
- S: (-) meaning S is in the word but in the wrong position.
- E: (-) meaning E is in the word but in the wrong position.

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters R, S, and E, but not in the positions they were in ""raise"". Specifically:
  - R is not the first letter (since it was in position 1 and is wrong position).
  - S is not the fourth letter (was in position 4).
  - E is not the fifth letter (was in position 5).
- The secret word does not contain A or I.

Also, note that the word has 5 letters and must be a valid English word.

We have 6 tries, and this is our second guess.

We need to form a new word that:
- Includes R, S, and E (since they are in the secret word) but in different positions than in ""raise"".
- Excludes A and I (and also any other letters we know are not present, but so far only A and I are ruled out).

Moreover, we must place R, S, and E in positions that are not 1, 4, and 5 respectively? Actually, the feedback says:
- R is in the word but not in position 1. So R must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5? But note: we don't know if the word has multiple R's? The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. However, the feedback for each letter is independent. Since we only have one R in ""raise"", and it was marked as present but wrong position, that means there is at least one R in the word, and it is not in position 1.

Similarly for S and E: 
- S is present but not in position 4.
- E is present but not in position 5.

But note: the word might have more than one of these letters? However, we don't have evidence for duplicates yet.

We also know that A and I are absent, so we must avoid them.

Let's think of possible positions for R, S, and E.

We have to form a 5-letter word that uses R, S, E and two other letters (which are not A or I). Also, we don't know the other two letters yet.

We should try to cover more common letters to get more information.

Common consonants that we haven't tried: T, N, L, C, D, M, etc.

We should avoid using A and I again.

Let me try to think of words that have R, S, E in them, but not in positions 1, 4, and 5 respectively? Actually, we can place R in positions 2,3,4,5; S in positions 1,2,3,5; and E in positions 1,2,3,4.

But note: we must also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But without evidence, we assume no duplicates for now.

We can try to use a word that has R, S, E and two new letters.

One common word that comes to mind: ""RESET"" but that has two E's? And also, in ""reset"", R is in position 1, but we know R cannot be in position 1? Actually, in our feedback, R was in position 1 and was marked as present but wrong position, meaning that in the secret word, R is not in position 1. So if we put R in position 1 again, it would be wrong again. So we should avoid putting R in position 1.

Similarly, we should avoid putting S in position 4 and E in position 5.

So for our next guess, we want:
- R not in position 1
- S not in position 4
- E not in position 5

Also, the word must not contain A or I.

Let me think of words that have R, S, E.

Some possibilities:
- We can try to put S at the beginning? Then E and R in other positions.

Example: ""STERN"" - S in position 1 (which is allowed because we don't know if S can be at start? We only know it can't be in position 4). Also, E is in position 4? But we don't have a restriction on E for position 4? Only that E cannot be in position 5. Similarly, R is in position 3? That's allowed.

But let's check the letters: S, T, E, R, N. We haven't tried T or N. Also, no A or I.

So ""stern"" seems a good candidate.

Another word: ""SERUM"" - but that has U and M. Also, in ""serum"", S is in position 1, E in position 2, R in position 3. Then U and M. But we don't know about U and M.

But ""stern"" might be better because it has common letters.

Another one: ""CRESS"" - but that has two S's? And C. Also, R is in position 2? But we have to avoid R in position 1? Here R is in position 2, which is okay. But then E is in position 3? And S in position 4 and 5? But we have to avoid S in position 4? Actually, the feedback for S was that it is in the word but not in position 4. So if we put S in position 4 again, it might be wrong if the secret word has only one S? But we don't know. It's risky because if the secret word has only one S and we put it in position 4 again, we get the same feedback. So better to avoid position 4 for S.

In ""cress"", S is in position 4 and 5. So if we put S in position 4, it might be marked as wrong position again? But if the secret word has two S's, then it might be okay? However, we don't know. To be safe, we should avoid putting S in position 4.

Similarly, avoid E in position 5.

So ""stern"" has:
- S at position 1 (okay, not 4)
- T at 2 (new)
- E at 3 (okay, not 5)
- R at 4 (okay, not 1) -> but wait, we know R is not in position 1, but position 4 is allowed? Yes.
- N at 5 (new)

So ""stern"" seems good.

Another option: ""STREP"" (a medical term) or ""STREW"". But ""stern"" is more common.

We could also try ""ROUSE"" but R is in position 1? We must avoid R in position 1. So that's not allowed.

Another: ""USHER"" - U is new, S in position 2, H new, E in position 4, R in position 5. But we don't know about U and H. Also, S is in position 2 (which is okay) and E in position 4 (okay) and R in position 5 (okay). But we have U and H which are less common.

I think ""stern"" is a better choice because it uses common letters.

But note: we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence, so we assume no duplicates for now.

So I will go with ""stern"".

But let me double-check: the feedback from ""raise"" told us that R, S, E are in the word. So ""stern"" has R, S, E, and also T and N. We don't know about T and N, but that's okay.

We are trying to get more information.

Another word: ""CREST"" - C is new, R in position 2 (okay), E in position 3 (okay), S in position 4? We must avoid S in position 4. So that's bad.

""STERN"" avoids the forbidden positions.

So I think ""stern"" is a good second guess.

Therefore, we guess ""stern"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
- R is in the word but not in position 1 (marked as -).
- A is not in the word (marked as x).
- I is not in the word (marked as x).
- S is in the word but not in position 4 (marked as -).
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (marked as -).

Key insights:
- The secret word contains R, S, and E, but not A or I.
- R cannot be in position 1, S cannot be in position 4, and E cannot be in position 5.
- The word must include R, S, and E in new positions, along with two additional letters (not A or I).

For the second guess, I chose ""stern"" because:
- It includes all three known letters (R, S, E) while respecting their position constraints:
  - S is in position 1 (avoiding position 4).
  - E is in position 3 (avoiding position 5).
  - R is in position 4 (avoiding position 1).
- It introduces two new common letters (T and N) to test for presence.
- It avoids A and I, as required.
- ""Stern"" is a valid English word and maximizes new information.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We need to make our first guess. Since we have no prior information, we should choose a word that covers common letters.
Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N).
A good starting word might be one that includes several common letters.

One of the popular starting words in Wordle is ""CRANE"" because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). Another is ""SLATE"". However, note that we don't have any constraints.

Let me think of a word that includes a mix of vowels and common consonants. Here are a few options:
- CRANE: letters C, R, A, N, E
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E
- RAISE: R, A, I, S, E

I'll go with ""RAISE"" because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This might give good coverage.

Alternatively, we can use ""ROATE"" (which is an anagram of ORATE) but that is less common. I think ""RAISE"" is a solid choice.

So, my first guess: RAISE

  - E is not the fifth letter (was in position 5).
- The secret word does not contain A or I.

Also, note that the word has 5 letters and must be a valid English word.

We have 6 tries, and this is our second guess.

We need to form a new word that:
- Includes R, S, and E (since they are in the secret word) but in different positions than in ""raise"".
- Excludes A and I (and also any other letters we know are not present, but so far only A and I are ruled out).

Moreover, we must place R, S, and E in positions that are not 1, 4, and 5 respectively? Actually, the feedback says:
- R is in the word but not in position 1. So R must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5? But note: we don't know if the word has multiple R's? The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. However, the feedback for each letter is independent. Since we only have one R in ""raise"", and it was marked as present but wrong position, that means there is at least one R in the word, and it is not in position 1.

Similarly for S and E: 
- S is present but not in position 4.
- E is present but not in position 5.

But note: the word might have more than one of these letters? However, we don't have evidence for duplicates yet.

We also know that A and I are absent, so we must avoid them.

Let's think of possible positions for R, S, and E.

We have to form a 5-letter word that uses R, S, E and two other letters (which are not A or I). Also, we don't know the other two letters yet.

We should try to cover more common letters to get more information.

Common consonants that we haven't tried: T, N, L, C, D, M, etc.

We should avoid using A and I again.

Let me try to think of words that have R, S, E in them, but not in positions 1, 4, and 5 respectively? Actually, we can place R in positions 2,3,4,5; S in positions 1,2,3,5; and E in positions 1,2,3,4.

But note: we must also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But without evidence, we assume no duplicates for now.

We can try to use a word that has R, S, E and two new letters.

One common word that comes to mind: ""RESET"" but that has two E's? And also, in ""reset"", R is in position 1, but we know R cannot be in position 1? Actually, in our feedback, R was in position 1 and was marked as present but wrong position, meaning that in the secret word, R is not in position 1. So if we put R in position 1 again, it would be wrong again. So we should avoid putting R in position 1.

Similarly, we should avoid putting S in position 4 and E in position 5.

So for our next guess, we want:
- R not in position 1
- S not in position 4
- E not in position 5

Also, the word must not contain A or I.

Let me think of words that have R, S, E.

Some possibilities:
- We can try to put S at the beginning? Then E and R in other positions.

Example: ""STERN"" - S in position 1 (which is allowed because we don't know if S can be at start? We only know it can't be in position 4). Also, E is in position 4? But we don't have a restriction on E for position 4? Only that E cannot be in position 5. Similarly, R is in position 3? That's allowed.

But let's check the letters: S, T, E, R, N. We haven't tried T or N. Also, no A or I.

So ""stern"" seems a good candidate.

Another word: ""SERUM"" - but that has U and M. Also, in ""serum"", S is in position 1, E in position 2, R in position 3. Then U and M. But we don't know about U and M.

But ""stern"" might be better because it has common letters.

Another one: ""CRESS"" - but that has two S's? And C. Also, R is in position 2? But we have to avoid R in position 1? Here R is in position 2, which is okay. But then E is in position 3? And S in position 4 and 5? But we have to avoid S in position 4? Actually, the feedback for S was that it is in the word but not in position 4. So if we put S in position 4 again, it might be wrong if the secret word has only one S? But we don't know. It's risky because if the secret word has only one S and we put it in position 4 again, we get the same feedback. So better to avoid position 4 for S.

In ""cress"", S is in position 4 and 5. So if we put S in position 4, it might be marked as wrong position again? But if the secret word has two S's, then it might be okay? However, we don't know. To be safe, we should avoid putting S in position 4.

Similarly, avoid E in position 5.

So ""stern"" has:
- S at position 1 (okay, not 4)
- T at 2 (new)
- E at 3 (okay, not 5)
- R at 4 (okay, not 1) -> but wait, we know R is not in position 1, but position 4 is allowed? Yes.
- N at 5 (new)

So ""stern"" seems good.

Another option: ""STREP"" (a medical term) or ""STREW"". But ""stern"" is more common.

We could also try ""ROUSE"" but R is in position 1? We must avoid R in position 1. So that's not allowed.

Another: ""USHER"" - U is new, S in position 2, H new, E in position 4, R in position 5. But we don't know about U and H. Also, S is in position 2 (which is okay) and E in position 4 (okay) and R in position 5 (okay). But we have U and H which are less common.

I think ""stern"" is a better choice because it uses common letters.

But note: we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence, so we assume no duplicates for now.

So I will go with ""stern"".

But let me double-check: the feedback from ""raise"" told us that R, S, E are in the word. So ""stern"" has R, S, E, and also T and N. We don't know about T and N, but that's okay.

We are trying to get more information.

Another word: ""CREST"" - C is new, R in position 2 (okay), E in position 3 (okay), S in position 4? We must avoid S in position 4. So that's bad.

""STERN"" avoids the forbidden positions.

So I think ""stern"" is a good second guess.

Therefore, we guess ""stern"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
- R is in the word but not in position 1 (marked as -).
- A is not in the word (marked as x).
- I is not in the word (marked as x).
- S is in the word but not in position 4 (marked as -).
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (marked as -).

Key insights:
- The secret word contains R, S, and E, but not A or I.
- R cannot be in position 1, S cannot be in position 4, and E cannot be in position 5.
- The word must include R, S, and E in new positions, along with two additional letters (not A or I).

For the second guess, I chose ""stern"" because:
- It includes all three known letters (R, S, E) while respecting their position constraints:
  - S is in position 1 (avoiding position 4).
  - E is in position 3 (avoiding position 5).
  - R is in position 4 (avoiding position 1).
- It introduces two new common letters (T and N) to test for presence.
- It avoids A and I, as required.
- ""Stern"" is a valid English word and maximizes new information.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""raise""
- R: present but wrong position (not position 1)
- A: absent
- I: absent
- S: present but wrong position (not position 4)
- E: present but wrong position (not position 5)

Guess 2: ""stern""
- S: correct position (position 1)
- T: absent
- E: correct position (position 3)
- R: present but wrong position (not position 4)
- N: present but wrong position (not position 5)

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. The secret word has S as the first letter (from ""stern"" feedback: S is correct at position 1).
2. The secret word has E as the third letter (from ""stern"" feedback: E is correct at position 3).
3. The secret word contains R and N, but:
   - R is not in position 4 (from ""stern"") and also not in position 1 (from ""raise"").
   - N is not in position 5 (from ""stern"").
4. The secret word does not contain A, I, or T (absent from both guesses).

Also, from the first guess, we know that the word has R, S, E, and now we know S is at 1 and E is at 3.

Additionally, we have N present (from ""stern""), so the word also has N.

So the secret word has: S (position 1), E (position 3), and also R and N somewhere, but not in the positions we've tried.

Moreover, we have one more letter to find, since it's a 5-letter word.

Current known positions:
Position 1: S
Position 2: ? (unknown)
Position 3: E
Position 4: ? (unknown)
Position 5: ? (unknown)

We know the word contains R and N, but they are not in positions 1, 3, and also R is not in 4 (from ""stern"") and N is not in 5 (from ""stern"").

Possible positions for R: since it can't be in 1 (from ""raise"") or 4 (from ""stern""), and position 3 is taken by E, so R can only be in position 2 or 5.

Similarly, for N: it can't be in 5 (from ""stern""), and positions 1 and 3 are taken, so N can be in position 2 or 4.

But note: the word has 5 letters, and we have S, E, R, N, and one more letter. We don't know the fifth letter yet.

We also know that T, A, I are absent.

Now, we need to form a word that fits:
- Starts with S, third letter E.
- Contains R and N.
- R must be in position 2 or 5.
- N must be in position 2 or 4.

But position 2 can only be one letter, so if R is in 2, then N must be in 4. If N is in 2, then R must be in 5 (since if N is in 2, R can be in 5; and if R is in 2, N can be in 4). Also, position 5 is open.

We also need to find the fifth letter for the remaining position.

Let's consider the possibilities:

Case 1: R in position 2, then N must be in position 4 (since position 5 is left for the unknown letter, but N can be in 4). Then position 5 is the unknown letter.

Case 2: N in position 2, then R must be in position 5 (since it can't be in 4, and 1 and 3 are taken). Then position 4 is the unknown letter.

Case 3: It's also possible that the word has duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence for that, so we assume no duplicates for now.

We need to think of words that fit these patterns.

Pattern 1: S _ E _ _ 
With R in position 2 and N in position 4: then the word would be S R E N ? 
But we need a valid word: SREN? is not a word. The word would be S?R?E?N? but with positions: position 1: S, 2: R, 3: E, 4: N, 5: ? 
What words are there? ""Siren"" but I is absent, so not allowed. ""Soren"" is a name, but let's see. ""Seron"" not a word. I can't think of a common word with S, R, E, N in positions 1,2,3,4.

Pattern 2: S _ E _ _ with N in position 2 and R in position 5: then S N E ? R
Words: ""SNEER"" - that's a word! S N E E R. But we have E in position 3 and also E in position 4? But we know E is only in position 3? From the first guess, E was present but not in position 5, and now we have E in position 3 correct. But ""sneer"" has two E's: positions 3 and 4.

But we don't know if the word has duplicate E's. The feedback from ""raise"" had E in position 5 marked as wrong position, but it didn't say anything about other positions. Similarly, in ""stern"", E was in position 3 and correct, but that doesn't rule out another E.

In fact, in ""raise"", E was marked as present but wrong position (position 5), so if there is another E in position 4, for example, that would be consistent.

So ""sneer"" is a possibility: S N E E R.

But let's check the letters: we have S, N, E, E, R. We know the word has R and N, and S and E. Also, no A, I, T.

In ""sneer"", position 2 is N, position 3 is E (correct), position 4 is E, position 5 is R.

But we have R in position 5? And from feedback, R cannot be in position 1 or 4, but position 5 is allowed.

Similarly, N is in position 2, which is allowed (since we only know it can't be in position 5).

But we need to consider if there are other words.

Pattern 3: R in position 5 and N in position 2: same as above, ""sneer"".

Pattern 4: R in position 2 and N in position 4: but we need a word S R E N ? 

What could be the last letter? It must be a letter that forms a word, and not A, I, T.

For example, ""siren"" has I, which is absent. ""saree"" has A and two E's, but A is absent. ""seren"" is not a word. ""screw"" has C and W, but then N is missing? No, we need N. In this pattern, we have S, R, E, N, so the fifth letter must be something else.

But I can't think of a common word with S R E N in positions 1,2,3,4.

Another pattern: if R is in position 5 and N in position 4, then the word is S _ E N R.

What words? ""SENOR"" - that's a word (Spanish for Mr., but accepted in English). S E N O R? But position 3 is E, so S _ E N R: position 1:S, 2:?, 3:E, 4:N, 5:R.

So ""senor"" would be S E N O R, but that has E in position 2? No, we need E in position 3. In ""senor"", it's S-E-N-O-R, so position 1:S, 2:E, 3:N, 4:O, 5:R. But we need position 3 to be E, so that doesn't match.

We need position 3 to be E, so for S _ E N R, the second letter is unknown, and then E at 3, N at 4, R at 5.

What words? ""Sewer"" has W, but then position 3 is E, 4 is W? Not N. ""Sever"" has V, but again not N. ""Seder"" has D, but not N. I can't think of a word with S, ?, E, N, R.

Perhaps ""shiner"" but that's 6 letters. No, 5 letters.

Another possibility: N in position 2 and R in position 5, which is the ""sneer"" case.

Or, R in position 2 and N in position 5? But N cannot be in position 5, from ""stern"" feedback: N is present but not in position 5. So N cannot be in position 5.

Similarly, R cannot be in position 4.

So the only possibilities are:
- R in position 2 and N in position 4: word pattern S R E N ? 
- Or R in position 5 and N in position 2: word pattern S N E ? R

But for S R E N ?, we need a fifth letter. What could it be? The word must be valid.

Possible words: 
- ""siren"" but I is absent, invalid.
- ""saree"" but A is absent and it has E at the end? S A R E E, but position 3 is R? Not E. Doesn't match pattern.
- ""seren"" is not a word.

What about ""syren""? That's a variant of siren, but again has I? No, ""syren"" is S Y R E N, which would be position 1:S, 2:Y, 3:R, 4:E, 5:N? But we need position 3 to be E, not R. So no.

Perhaps we are missing something. Another idea: the word might have duplicate letters. For example, in the S R E N ? pattern, if the last letter is E, then ""srene"" is not a word.

Maybe N is not in position 4 but in position 2, and R in position 5, so S N E ? R.

Then, with ? in position 4.

Words: 
- ""sneer"": S N E E R -> positions: 1:S, 2:N, 3:E, 4:E, 5:R
- ""sneak"" has A and K, but A is absent and position 5 is K, not R.
- ""snore"" has O, but position 3 is O? Not E. S N O R E, position 3 is O, not E.
- ""snare"" has A, absent.
- ""sneap"" is rare, and has A and P.

So ""sneer"" seems a strong candidate.

But is there another word? ""sneer"" is valid.

Another possibility: R in position 2 and N in position 4, but with a different fifth letter? For example, ""screw"" has C and W, but then position 3 is E? S C R E W, that's position 1:S, 2:C, 3:R, 4:E, 5:W. But we need position 3 to be E, not R. So no.

""serow"" is an animal, but S E R O W, position 3 is R, not E.

I think ""sneer"" is the only common word that fits.

But let's confirm the feedback we would get if the word is ""sneer"".

If secret word is ""sneer"", and we guessed ""stern"": 
- S: position 1, same -> correct
- T: not in word -> absent
- E: position 3, same -> correct
- R: in ""stern"" at position 4, but in ""sneer"" R is at position 5, so present but wrong position -> matches -
- N: in ""stern"" at position 5, but in ""sneer"" N is at position 2, so present but wrong position -> matches -

Also, from ""raise"": 
- R: in ""raise"" position 1, but in ""sneer"" position 5 -> wrong position, so -
- A: absent -> x
- I: absent -> x
- S: in ""raise"" position 4, but in ""sneer"" position 1 -> wrong position, so -
- E: in ""raise"" position 5, but in ""sneer"" position 3 and 4? Actually, ""sneer"" has E at 3 and 4. In ""raise"", E is at 5, which is not present? But ""sneer"" has E at 3 and 4, so E is present, but not at position 5, so the feedback should be - for E (wrong position). That matches.

So ""sneer"" is consistent with all feedback.

But is there another possibility? For example, could the word have a different fifth letter?

What if the word is ""sever"" but V is not ruled out, but ""sever"" has E at 3, but then R at 5? S E V E R, but position 2 is E, but we need position 3 to be E? S E V E R: position 1:S, 2:E, 3:V, 4:E, 5:R. But we need position 3 to be E, which it is not; it's V. So no.

""sheer"" has H, but position 3 is E? S H E E R, position 1:S, 2:H, 3:E, 4:E, 5:R. This is similar to ""sneer"" but with H instead of N. But we know N is present from ""stern"" feedback. In ""stern"", N was marked as present but wrong position, so if the word is ""sheer"", then N would be absent, but feedback said N is present. So ""sheer"" cannot be because it doesn't have N.

Similarly, ""steer"" has T, but T is absent, and also position 3 is E? S T E E R, position 1:S, 2:T, 3:E, 4:E, 5:R. But T is absent, so not possible.

Therefore, ""sneer"" seems the only word that fits.

But we have to make a guess. We can guess ""sneer"" to test.

But note: we are on the third guess, and we have three more guesses if needed.

Perhaps there are other words where R and N are in different positions? But we thought of the possibilities.

Another pattern: what if N is in position 4 and R in position 2? But we couldn't find a word.

Or, what if the word has only one E? But in ""sneer"" there are two E's, which is allowed.

Perhaps ""scene"" but position 3 is E? S C E N E, position 1:S, 2:C, 3:E, 4:N, 5:E. Then R is missing? But we know R is present, so not.

""scree"" has C and two E's, but no N.

I think ""sneer"" is the best guess.

But let's see if there is a word with R in position 5 and N in position 4? Then pattern S _ E N R.

What words? ""Sewn"" is 4 letters. ""Shiner"" is 6. ""Sinner"" is 6. ""Senser"" not a word. ""Sender"" has D, but position 3 is N? S E N D E R, too long.

I think it's safe to go with ""sneer"".

So our third guess: ""sneer""

But note: in ""sneer"", position 4 is E, which is the same as position 3? We don't have information about position 4 yet.

We are guessing to confirm.

Perhaps we can think of a word that tests other letters.

But we know the word must have S at 1, E at 3, and R and N present, and one more letter.

In ""sneer"", the fifth letter is E, which we already know is present.

If we want to test a new letter, we could try a word that has a different letter in position 2,4, or 5.

For example, we know position 2 must be either N or something else? But from the possibilities, position 2 must be N if R is in 5, or R if N is in 4. But we couldn't find a word with R in 2 and N in 4.

So let's list all possible words that fit:

- Must start with S, have E in third position.
- Contain R and N.
- Avoid A, I, T.

Possible words:

1. ""sneer"" - S N E E R
2. ""saber"" but A is absent and position 3 is B? Not E.
3. ""safer"" A absent.
4. ""sager"" A absent.
5. ""saker"" A absent.
6. ""saner"" A absent and position 3 is N? Not E.
7. ""seder"" D, but no N? S E D E R, no N.
8. ""sefer"" not common, and no N.
9. ""sewer"" W, no N.
10. ""sever"" V, no N.
11. ""sheer"" H, no N? But we need N present.
12. ""skeer"" not common, K, and E at 3? S K E E R, but K is new, and we have N missing? No, we need N. ""skeer"" doesn't have N.
13. ""sleer"" not common, L, no N.
14. ""smeer"" not common, M, no N.
15. ""speer"" P, no N.
16. ""steer"" T absent.
17. ""sweer"" not common, W, no N.

What about ""snore""? But position 3 is O, not E.

""snare"" A absent.

""senor"" position 3 is N, not E.

I think ""sneer"" is the only common word that fits the criteria.

Therefore, we should guess ""sneer"".

But let's consider if there is a word with N in position 2 and R in position 5, but with a different letter in position 4, not E.

For example, ""snarl"" has A and L, but A absent.

""snark"" has A and K, absent A.

""snort"" has O and T, T absent.

""snurf"" not a word.

So no, ""sneer"" seems the only one.

Thus, we go with ""sneer"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""raise""** → R(-), A(x), I(x), S(-), E(-)  
  - R, S, and E are in the word but not in positions 1, 4, or 5 respectively.
  - A and I are absent.
- **Guess 2: ""stern""** → S(✓), T(x), E(✓), R(-), N(-)  
  - S is correct at position 1.
  - E is correct at position 3.
  - T is absent.
  - R is in the word but not in position 4.
  - N is in the word but not in position 5.

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed positions**:
   - Position 1: S (fixed).
   - Position 3: E (fixed).
2. **Present letters (but position unknown)**:
   - R: Cannot be in positions 1 (from ""raise"") or 4 (from ""stern""), so must be in position 2 or 5.
   - N: Cannot be in position 5 (from ""stern""), so must be in position 2 or 4.
3. **Absent letters**: A, I, T (must avoid these).
4. **Word structure**: The secret word is S _ E _ _, with R and N present in the remaining positions (2, 4, or 5), and one additional unknown letter.
5. **Constraints**:
   - Position 2: Could be R, N, or the unknown letter.
   - Position 4: Could be N or the unknown letter (if R is in position 5).
   - Position 5: Could be R or the unknown letter (if N is in position 2 or 4).

### Analysis of Possible Words:
- The only common English word that fits all constraints is **""sneer""**:
  - S (position 1, correct), N (position 2, not tested before for this position), E (position 3, correct), E (position 4, unknown), R (position 5, not position 4).
  - It includes R and N (both required), avoids A, I, T, and satisfies all positional constraints.
  - Other possibilities (e.g., ""sheer"", ""steer"") were ruled out because they lack N or contain absent letters like T.
- Guessing ""sneer"" tests:
  - Whether N is in position 2.
  - Whether R is in position 5.
  - Whether there is a second E (in position 4), which is consistent with the feedback (E was marked as present but wrong position in ""raise"", allowing for multiple E's).

### Conclusion:
This guess maximizes information by confirming the positions of R and N while testing for a potential duplicate E. If correct, it solves the puzzle; if not, the feedback will clarify the remaining letters.

<guess>sneer</guess>",sneer,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""raise""
- R: present but wrong position (not position 1)
- A: absent
- I: absent
- S: present but wrong position (not position 4)
- E: present but wrong position (not position 5)

Guess 2: ""stern""
- S: correct position (position 1)
- T: absent
- E: correct position (position 3)
- R: present but wrong position (not position 4)
- N: present but wrong position (not position 5)

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. The secret word has S as the first letter (from ""stern"" feedback: S is correct at position 1).
2. The secret word has E as the third letter (from ""stern"" feedback: E is correct at position 3).
3. The secret word contains R and N, but:
   - R is not in position 4 (from ""stern"") and also not in position 1 (from ""raise"").
   - N is not in position 5 (from ""stern"").
4. The secret word does not contain A, I, or T (absent from both guesses).

Also, from the first guess, we know that the word has R, S, E, and now we know S is at 1 and E is at 3.

Additionally, we have N present (from ""stern""), so the word also has N.

So the secret word has: S (position 1), E (position 3), and also R and N somewhere, but not in the positions we've tried.

Moreover, we have one more letter to find, since it's a 5-letter word.

Current known positions:
Position 1: S
Position 2: ? (unknown)
Position 3: E
Position 4: ? (unknown)
Position 5: ? (unknown)

We know the word contains R and N, but they are not in positions 1, 3, and also R is not in 4 (from ""stern"") and N is not in 5 (from ""stern"").

Possible positions for R: since it can't be in 1 (from ""raise"") or 4 (from ""stern""), and position 3 is taken by E, so R can only be in position 2 or 5.

Similarly, for N: it can't be in 5 (from ""stern""), and positions 1 and 3 are taken, so N can be in position 2 or 4.

But note: the word has 5 letters, and we have S, E, R, N, and one more letter. We don't know the fifth letter yet.

We also know that T, A, I are absent.

Now, we need to form a word that fits:
- Starts with S, third letter E.
- Contains R and N.
- R must be in position 2 or 5.
- N must be in position 2 or 4.

But position 2 can only be one letter, so if R is in 2, then N must be in 4. If N is in 2, then R must be in 5 (since if N is in 2, R can be in 5; and if R is in 2, N can be in 4). Also, position 5 is open.

We also need to find the fifth letter for the remaining position.

Let's consider the possibilities:

Case 1: R in position 2, then N must be in position 4 (since position 5 is left for the unknown letter, but N can be in 4). Then position 5 is the unknown letter.

Case 2: N in position 2, then R must be in position 5 (since it can't be in 4, and 1 and 3 are taken). Then position 4 is the unknown letter.

Case 3: It's also possible that the word has duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence for that, so we assume no duplicates for now.

We need to think of words that fit these patterns.

Pattern 1: S _ E _ _ 
With R in position 2 and N in position 4: then the word would be S R E N ? 
But we need a valid word: SREN? is not a word. The word would be S?R?E?N? but with positions: position 1: S, 2: R, 3: E, 4: N, 5: ? 
What words are there? ""Siren"" but I is absent, so not allowed. ""Soren"" is a name, but let's see. ""Seron"" not a word. I can't think of a common word with S, R, E, N in positions 1,2,3,4.

Pattern 2: S _ E _ _ with N in position 2 and R in position 5: then S N E ? R
Words: ""SNEER"" - that's a word! S N E E R. But we have E in position 3 and also E in position 4? But we know E is only in position 3? From the first guess, E was present but not in position 5, and now we have E in position 3 correct. But ""sneer"" has two E's: positions 3 and 4.

But we don't know if the word has duplicate E's. The feedback from ""raise"" had E in position 5 marked as wrong position, but it didn't say anything about other positions. Similarly, in ""stern"", E was in position 3 and correct, but that doesn't rule out another E.

In fact, in ""raise"", E was marked as present but wrong position (position 5), so if there is another E in position 4, for example, that would be consistent.

So ""sneer"" is a possibility: S N E E R.

But let's check the letters: we have S, N, E, E, R. We know the word has R and N, and S and E. Also, no A, I, T.

In ""sneer"", position 2 is N, position 3 is E (correct), position 4 is E, position 5 is R.

But we have R in position 5? And from feedback, R cannot be in position 1 or 4, but position 5 is allowed.

Similarly, N is in position 2, which is allowed (since we only know it can't be in position 5).

But we need to consider if there are other words.

Pattern 3: R in position 5 and N in position 2: same as above, ""sneer"".

Pattern 4: R in position 2 and N in position 4: but we need a word S R E N ? 

What could be the last letter? It must be a letter that forms a word, and not A, I, T.

For example, ""siren"" has I, which is absent. ""saree"" has A and two E's, but A is absent. ""seren"" is not a word. ""screw"" has C and W, but then N is missing? No, we need N. In this pattern, we have S, R, E, N, so the fifth letter must be something else.

But I can't think of a common word with S R E N in positions 1,2,3,4.

Another pattern: if R is in position 5 and N in position 4, then the word is S _ E N R.

What words? ""SENOR"" - that's a word (Spanish for Mr., but accepted in English). S E N O R? But position 3 is E, so S _ E N R: position 1:S, 2:?, 3:E, 4:N, 5:R.

So ""senor"" would be S E N O R, but that has E in position 2? No, we need E in position 3. In ""senor"", it's S-E-N-O-R, so position 1:S, 2:E, 3:N, 4:O, 5:R. But we need position 3 to be E, so that doesn't match.

We need position 3 to be E, so for S _ E N R, the second letter is unknown, and then E at 3, N at 4, R at 5.

What words? ""Sewer"" has W, but then position 3 is E, 4 is W? Not N. ""Sever"" has V, but again not N. ""Seder"" has D, but not N. I can't think of a word with S, ?, E, N, R.

Perhaps ""shiner"" but that's 6 letters. No, 5 letters.

Another possibility: N in position 2 and R in position 5, which is the ""sneer"" case.

Or, R in position 2 and N in position 5? But N cannot be in position 5, from ""stern"" feedback: N is present but not in position 5. So N cannot be in position 5.

Similarly, R cannot be in position 4.

So the only possibilities are:
- R in position 2 and N in position 4: word pattern S R E N ? 
- Or R in position 5 and N in position 2: word pattern S N E ? R

But for S R E N ?, we need a fifth letter. What could it be? The word must be valid.

Possible words: 
- ""siren"" but I is absent, invalid.
- ""saree"" but A is absent and it has E at the end? S A R E E, but position 3 is R? Not E. Doesn't match pattern.
- ""seren"" is not a word.

What about ""syren""? That's a variant of siren, but again has I? No, ""syren"" is S Y R E N, which would be position 1:S, 2:Y, 3:R, 4:E, 5:N? But we need position 3 to be E, not R. So no.

Perhaps we are missing something. Another idea: the word might have duplicate letters. For example, in the S R E N ? pattern, if the last letter is E, then ""srene"" is not a word.

Maybe N is not in position 4 but in position 2, and R in position 5, so S N E ? R.

Then, with ? in position 4.

Words: 
- ""sneer"": S N E E R -> positions: 1:S, 2:N, 3:E, 4:E, 5:R
- ""sneak"" has A and K, but A is absent and position 5 is K, not R.
- ""snore"" has O, but position 3 is O? Not E. S N O R E, position 3 is O, not E.
- ""snare"" has A, absent.
- ""sneap"" is rare, and has A and P.

So ""sneer"" seems a strong candidate.

But is there another word? ""sneer"" is valid.

Another possibility: R in position 2 and N in position 4, but with a different fifth letter? For example, ""screw"" has C and W, but then position 3 is E? S C R E W, that's position 1:S, 2:C, 3:R, 4:E, 5:W. But we need position 3 to be E, not R. So no.

""serow"" is an animal, but S E R O W, position 3 is R, not E.

I think ""sneer"" is the only common word that fits.

But let's confirm the feedback we would get if the word is ""sneer"".

If secret word is ""sneer"", and we guessed ""stern"": 
- S: position 1, same -> correct
- T: not in word -> absent
- E: position 3, same -> correct
- R: in ""stern"" at position 4, but in ""sneer"" R is at position 5, so present but wrong position -> matches -
- N: in ""stern"" at position 5, but in ""sneer"" N is at position 2, so present but wrong position -> matches -

Also, from ""raise"": 
- R: in ""raise"" position 1, but in ""sneer"" position 5 -> wrong position, so -
- A: absent -> x
- I: absent -> x
- S: in ""raise"" position 4, but in ""sneer"" position 1 -> wrong position, so -
- E: in ""raise"" position 5, but in ""sneer"" position 3 and 4? Actually, ""sneer"" has E at 3 and 4. In ""raise"", E is at 5, which is not present? But ""sneer"" has E at 3 and 4, so E is present, but not at position 5, so the feedback should be - for E (wrong position). That matches.

So ""sneer"" is consistent with all feedback.

But is there another possibility? For example, could the word have a different fifth letter?

What if the word is ""sever"" but V is not ruled out, but ""sever"" has E at 3, but then R at 5? S E V E R, but position 2 is E, but we need position 3 to be E? S E V E R: position 1:S, 2:E, 3:V, 4:E, 5:R. But we need position 3 to be E, which it is not; it's V. So no.

""sheer"" has H, but position 3 is E? S H E E R, position 1:S, 2:H, 3:E, 4:E, 5:R. This is similar to ""sneer"" but with H instead of N. But we know N is present from ""stern"" feedback. In ""stern"", N was marked as present but wrong position, so if the word is ""sheer"", then N would be absent, but feedback said N is present. So ""sheer"" cannot be because it doesn't have N.

Similarly, ""steer"" has T, but T is absent, and also position 3 is E? S T E E R, position 1:S, 2:T, 3:E, 4:E, 5:R. But T is absent, so not possible.

Therefore, ""sneer"" seems the only word that fits.

But we have to make a guess. We can guess ""sneer"" to test.

But note: we are on the third guess, and we have three more guesses if needed.

Perhaps there are other words where R and N are in different positions? But we thought of the possibilities.

Another pattern: what if N is in position 4 and R in position 2? But we couldn't find a word.

Or, what if the word has only one E? But in ""sneer"" there are two E's, which is allowed.

Perhaps ""scene"" but position 3 is E? S C E N E, position 1:S, 2:C, 3:E, 4:N, 5:E. Then R is missing? But we know R is present, so not.

""scree"" has C and two E's, but no N.

I think ""sneer"" is the best guess.

But let's see if there is a word with R in position 5 and N in position 4? Then pattern S _ E N R.

What words? ""Sewn"" is 4 letters. ""Shiner"" is 6. ""Sinner"" is 6. ""Senser"" not a word. ""Sender"" has D, but position 3 is N? S E N D E R, too long.

I think it's safe to go with ""sneer"".

So our third guess: ""sneer""

But note: in ""sneer"", position 4 is E, which is the same as position 3? We don't have information about position 4 yet.

We are guessing to confirm.

Perhaps we can think of a word that tests other letters.

But we know the word must have S at 1, E at 3, and R and N present, and one more letter.

In ""sneer"", the fifth letter is E, which we already know is present.

If we want to test a new letter, we could try a word that has a different letter in position 2,4, or 5.

For example, we know position 2 must be either N or something else? But from the possibilities, position 2 must be N if R is in 5, or R if N is in 4. But we couldn't find a word with R in 2 and N in 4.

So let's list all possible words that fit:

- Must start with S, have E in third position.
- Contain R and N.
- Avoid A, I, T.

Possible words:

1. ""sneer"" - S N E E R
2. ""saber"" but A is absent and position 3 is B? Not E.
3. ""safer"" A absent.
4. ""sager"" A absent.
5. ""saker"" A absent.
6. ""saner"" A absent and position 3 is N? Not E.
7. ""seder"" D, but no N? S E D E R, no N.
8. ""sefer"" not common, and no N.
9. ""sewer"" W, no N.
10. ""sever"" V, no N.
11. ""sheer"" H, no N? But we need N present.
12. ""skeer"" not common, K, and E at 3? S K E E R, but K is new, and we have N missing? No, we need N. ""skeer"" doesn't have N.
13. ""sleer"" not common, L, no N.
14. ""smeer"" not common, M, no N.
15. ""speer"" P, no N.
16. ""steer"" T absent.
17. ""sweer"" not common, W, no N.

What about ""snore""? But position 3 is O, not E.

""snare"" A absent.

""senor"" position 3 is N, not E.

I think ""sneer"" is the only common word that fits the criteria.

Therefore, we should guess ""sneer"".

But let's consider if there is a word with N in position 2 and R in position 5, but with a different letter in position 4, not E.

For example, ""snarl"" has A and L, but A absent.

""snark"" has A and K, absent A.

""snort"" has O and T, T absent.

""snurf"" not a word.

So no, ""sneer"" seems the only one.

Thus, we go with ""sneer"".Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""raise""** → R(-), A(x), I(x), S(-), E(-)  
  - R, S, and E are in the word but not in positions 1, 4, or 5 respectively.
  - A and I are absent.
- **Guess 2: ""stern""** → S(✓), T(x), E(✓), R(-), N(-)  
  - S is correct at position 1.
  - E is correct at position 3.
  - T is absent.
  - R is in the word but not in position 4.
  - N is in the word but not in position 5.

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed positions**:
   - Position 1: S (fixed).
   - Position 3: E (fixed).
2. **Present letters (but position unknown)**:
   - R: Cannot be in positions 1 (from ""raise"") or 4 (from ""stern""), so must be in position 2 or 5.
   - N: Cannot be in position 5 (from ""stern""), so must be in position 2 or 4.
3. **Absent letters**: A, I, T (must avoid these).
4. **Word structure**: The secret word is S _ E _ _, with R and N present in the remaining positions (2, 4, or 5), and one additional unknown letter.
5. **Constraints**:
   - Position 2: Could be R, N, or the unknown letter.
   - Position 4: Could be N or the unknown letter (if R is in position 5).
   - Position 5: Could be R or the unknown letter (if N is in position 2 or 4).

### Analysis of Possible Words:
- The only common English word that fits all constraints is **""sneer""**:
  - S (position 1, correct), N (position 2, not tested before for this position), E (position 3, correct), E (position 4, unknown), R (position 5, not position 4).
  - It includes R and N (both required), avoids A, I, T, and satisfies all positional constraints.
  - Other possibilities (e.g., ""sheer"", ""steer"") were ruled out because they lack N or contain absent letters like T.
- Guessing ""sneer"" tests:
  - Whether N is in position 2.
  - Whether R is in position 5.
  - Whether there is a second E (in position 4), which is consistent with the feedback (E was marked as present but wrong position in ""raise"", allowing for multiple E's).

### Conclusion:
This guess maximizes information by confirming the positions of R and N while testing for a potential duplicate E. If correct, it solves the puzzle; if not, the feedback will clarify the remaining letters.",Guess 3: sneer -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) N(✓) E(✓) E(✓) R(✓),SUCCESS
