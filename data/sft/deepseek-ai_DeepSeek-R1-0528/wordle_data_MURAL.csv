First, I'm starting the game and need to make my first guess. Since it's the first guess, I have no prior feedback, so I should choose a word that maximizes the information I get.

A common strategy in Wordle is to start with words that have a good mix of common vowels and consonants. This helps in identifying which letters are present or absent.

I recall that words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ROAST"" are popular starters because they contain frequent letters. But I should pick one that covers different possibilities.

Let me think about letter frequency in English words. According to common knowledge, vowels like E, A, I, O, U are frequent, and consonants like R, S, T, L, N are also common.

To cover multiple common letters, words like ""ARISE"" or ""RAISE"" might be good. But I want to maximize coverage.

Perhaps ""CRATE"" – it has C, R, A, T, E. That's one vowel and four consonants.

Another one is ""SLICE"" with S, L, I, C, E.

I think ""CRANE"" is a solid first guess. Let me confirm: C, R, A, N, E. That includes three vowels? A and E are vowels, C is consonant, R consonant, N consonant. Actually, two vowels: A and E.

A and E are vowels, but I is also common. Maybe ""RAISE"" is better: R, A, I, S, E – that has three vowels: A, I, E.

Vowels: A, E, I, O, U. In ""RAISE"", A, I, E are vowels, so three vowels. In ""CRANE"", A and E are vowels, so two vowels. More vowels might be better for testing.

But consonants are important too. Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N.

So, a word like ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E – that's S, L, T consonants and A, E vowels.

""ROAST"" has R, O, A, S, T – R, S, T consonants and O, A vowels.

I should aim for a word with no repeating letters to maximize distinct letters.

Yes, all guesses should have unique letters to get more information.

So, for first guess, priority is: common letters, no repeats.

Let's list some top starters based on Wordle strategies:

- ""CRANE""

- ""SLATE""

- ""RAISE""

- ""ROATE"" (not a common word, but used)

""ADIEU"" has A, D, I, E, U – four vowels, but D might be less common.

I think ""SOARE"" is used, but not common.

I'll go with ""CRANE"" for my first guess. It has C, R, A, N, E – all common letters, and C and N might test less frequent ones.

But according to frequency, E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U are top.

E is most frequent.

So words with E, A, R, T, S are good.

""SALET"" or ""CRATE"".

I think ""CRANE"" is fine.

To be systematic, I'll choose ""RAISE"": R, A, I, S, E – includes R, A, I, S, E – all high frequency.

R, A, S are top consonants, E is top vowel, I is vowel.

Yes, ""RAISE"" seems excellent.

In the rules, I need to output in specific format.

So, for my first guess, I'll guess ""RAISE"".

But let me confirm it's a valid 5-letter word. ""Raise"" – yes, it's common.

Perhaps ""ARISE"" is similar.

I'll go with ""RAISE"".

For the first guess in Wordle, I need to choose a word that maximizes the potential for useful feedback. Since there's no prior information, I should select a word with common letters to increase the chances of identifying correct letters or positions. Common starting words often include a mix of frequent vowels and consonants, with all letters distinct to cover more possibilities.

Key considerations:
- Letter frequency in English: E, A, R, I, S are among the most common (based on corpus data).
- Including multiple vowels can help test for essential word structure.
- Words like ""RAISE"", ""CRANE"", or ""SLATE"" are popular starters for this reason.

After evaluating options:
- ""RAISE"" contains R, A, I, S, E – all high-frequency letters.
- It has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).
- No repeated letters, so each position provides unique information.
- It's a valid 5-letter English word.

This guess should provide good feedback on whether any of these letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

We are given feedback for Guess 1: RAISE -> R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
 This means:
   R is in the word but in the wrong position.
   A is in the word but in the wrong position.
   I is not in the word.
   S is not in the word.
   E is not in the word.

 So, from this:
   - The secret word contains R and A, but not in the first and second positions respectively.
   - The word does not contain I, S, E.

 Since R is in the word but not position 1, it must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. However, note that in the feedback, R was in position 1 but marked wrong, so it can't be position 1. Similarly, A was in position 2 and marked wrong so it can't be in position 2.

 Also, the word does not have I, S, E.

 We must guess a new 5-letter word that must include R and A (since they are in the word), and exclude I, S, E.

 Moreover, we know R cannot be in position 1 and A cannot be in position 2.

 Let's think about possible placements for R and A.

 We need to choose a word that has R in a position other than 1, and A in a position other than 2.

 Since we have only one previous guess, we don't know much about the exact positions, so we can try to cover other common letters and also test new positions for R and A.

 Let's consider what letters are available. We know E, I, S are out. So we avoid these.

 Common letters left: T, O, N, L, U, D, C, M, P, etc.

 Since the word has R and A, we can include these and add other frequent letters.

 We have 6 tries, so we can try to get more information.

 We might try a word that has R and A in different positions and introduces new common letters.

 But note: we must not put R in position 1 and A in position 2.

 Let me try to list possibilities for R: positions 2,3,4,5
 For A: positions 1,3,4,5 (because it can't be 2)

 However, if we put A in position 1, that would be a possibility we haven't tested.

 We can try to put R in position 4 or 5 and A in position 1 or 3 or 4 or 5 (but not 2).

 One idea: start with A in a new position, and R in a new position, and add T, O, N which are common.

 Consider ""TAROT"": but that has T and O? Also, TAROT has repeated T? Actually, it has T twice? Let's check: T-A-R-O-T -> repeated T. Also, we need to avoid S, I, E.

 Another word: ""RADAR"" has repeated A and R? Not good because repeated letters and we don't know if the secret word has repeats.

 Since we don't know if there are repeats, it's safer to try a word with distinct letters.

 So, what about ""PLANT""? But we have E, I, S out? But P,L,A,N,T. But A is included? Yes. But where do we put R? We haven't included R. Remember R is present so we must include R in the guess because we know it's in the word.

 Important: we must include the letters that the feedback told us are present: R and A.

 So, the next guess must contain R and A, and must not contain I, S, E.

 And distinct letters if possible.

 So, let's think:

 We need to place R and A in positions other than R in 1 and A in 2.

 We can have:

 Position 1: not R (but can be A or another letter)
 Position 2: not A (but can be R? Wait, feedback from RAISE: R was in position 1 and was shown to be present but wrong position. So if we put R in position 2, that's allowed because we haven't tested R in position 2 before. Similarly, A in position 1 is allowed.

 However, note that R being present implies it is in the word somewhere, but we don't know where. Similarly for A.

 So, for guess 2, we can have:

 Option: put A in position 1 and R in position 3? Or R in position 5? Etc.

 Now, for the remaining letters: we need three more letters that are not I,S,E and are not duplicated.

 Let's choose common consonants and vowels excluding E,I,S.

 We have vowels: O,U,A (A we already have) but we need consonants? Actually, since A is included, we can use consonants.

 Common letters left: T, O, L, N, U, D, C, M, P, etc.

 We can form words with A and R and three of these.

 Possible words:

 - ""CAROM"": C-A-R-O-M -> letters C,A,R,O,M -> must check if valid. Carom is a word? Yes, meaning to strike and rebound. But it has R in position 3? And A in position 2? Wait, position 2 is A? But in feedback, we were told A is in the word but not in position 2? However, for the new guess, we don't know if position 2 might be the correct place? Wait no: In the previous feedback, A was in the second position (in RAISE) and marked as wrong position? That means the secret word has A, but it is not in position 2. So putting A in position 2 in a new guess is disallowed because we know A is not in position 2? Or can we still put it? No, because the feedback rule: the symbol ('-') means that the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, but it doesn't prevent us from guessing it again in the same position. However, logically, if we know that position 2 is wrong for A, we should avoid putting A in position 2 to avoid wasting a guess. Similarly, for R we know position 1 is wrong.

 Therefore, in the new guess, we should avoid:
 - R in position 1
 - A in position 2

 So for ""CAROM"": if I write C-A-R-O-M, then A is in position 2? That would be bad because we know A cannot be in position 2. So we should avoid that.

 Similarly, if I have a word starting with R (position 1) we know it's wrong.

 So, let me brainstorm words without R in 1 and without A in 2.

 Possibilities:

 Position 1: Any letter except R? Or except I,S,E? Actually any letter except R? We can put R elsewhere.

 How about ""FARCE""? F-A-R-C-E -> but E is excluded. We can't use E.

 Or ""YARTH""? Not a word.

 Word: ""OCTAL"" but missing R? We need R because we have to include the known letters.

 How about ""PARTY"": 
   P-A-R-T-Y -> 
      Position: 1: P (new, not R)
      Position 2: A -> this is position 2? But we cannot put A in position 2 because we know from feedback that A is not in position 2? So even though we are including A (which we know is in the word) we must avoid position 2 for A.

 Therefore, PARTY is invalid because A is in position 2.

 Another word: ""TRAWL"": 
   T-R-A-W-L -> 
      Position 1: T (new)
      Position 2: R -> but is R allowed in position 2? Let's see: in the feedback for RAISE, R was in position 1 and marked as wrong position. We don't know about position 2. So yes, R can be in position 2.

   But position 3: A -> which is position 3? That's not position 2 so it's allowed.

 So ""TRAWL"": 
   T (not E,I,S), R (in position 2: but we don't know if this is the correct position for R), A (position 3: safe because not position 2), W (new), L (new).
   Also, doesn't include I,S,E.

 But are we using the known presence? Yes, R and A are in the word.

 However, let's check if TRAWL is a word? Yes: to fish with a trawl net.

 Now, the problem: we are testing R in position 2 and A in position 3. But in the secret word, R and A might be in other positions. But that's okay because we might get feedback that they are not in these positions.

 Alternatively, we can avoid putting R and A in positions we suspect might be wrong? But we have no information except they are not in position 1 (R) and position 2 (A).

 An alternative: ""CARTY""? Not a word.

 ""DARAT""? Not a word.

 ""MAROON""? Too long.

 Another word: ""CRANK"": 
   C-R-A-N-K -> 
      Position 2: R? (allowed) 
      Position 3: A? (position 3 is not 2, so allowed) 
      But position 1: C? We haven't tested C. 
      But wait. In RAISE, we used R in pos1, A in pos2, etc. Now CRANK has R in pos2? Yes.

 But note: we know that E, I, S are out. N and K are new.

 CRANK is a word.

 However, we know that E, I, S are not in the word, but not that C is not? So including C is fine.

 But we are also missing R and A? We have R in position 2 and A in position 3.

 How about ""DRAWL"" but D-A? A in position 2? Avoid.

 Let me try to list:

 Without E,I,S and avoiding R in position 1 and A in position 2.

 How about:
   Position 1: T or L or O, etc.
   Position 2: R? (if we want to test R here) or other but not A? Actually we cannot put A in position 2, so we can put any other letter? But we want to get feedback on other positions.

 Another common word: ""ROAST"" but starts with R? That's position 1? We know R is not in position 1? So we must avoid putting R in position 1.

 Therefore, we cannot use ROAST.

 How about ""TAROT""? T-A-R-O-T -> A in position 2? Disallowed. And also repeated T? Not ideal.

 Perhaps ""BROAD"": 
   B-R-O-A-D -> 
        Position 2: R? Allowed.
        Position 4: A? Allowed (since not position 2).

 BROAD is a word? Yes.

 Also, BROAD: B, R, O, A, D -> new letters B, O, D, plus R and A.

 And avoids E,I,S.

 This seems better because we have R in position 2 and A in position 4? Positions: 
   1: B
   2: R
   3: O
   4: A
   5: D

 This puts R in a position we haven't tested (position 2) and A in position 4 (which we haven't tested). Also, we test O and D and B.

 But note: in RAISE, R was in position 1 and now we put R in position 2? We don't know if it might be correct? We don't have any information about position 2.

 Similarly, A was in position 2 in RAISE and now we put it in position 4.

 How about another word: ""CRAMP"": 
   C-R-A-M-P -> 
      R in pos2, A in pos3? Allowed? Yes.

 But CRAMP has M and P? Also good.

 CRAMP is a word.

 But BROAD might be better because it tests a vowel O? Or CRAMP tests consonants? 

 Since we don't know how many vowels are in the word? We know A is present and we avoided E,I (and O,U might be present).

 Given the feedback that RAISE had two yellows and three blacks, it's possible that the word has R, A, and three other letters.

 Let me think of the most frequent letters left: T, O, N, L, R, A are taken? R and A are in the word? So T, O, N, L are good choices to test.

 So perhaps BROAD (with O) or TRAIN? But TRAIN has A in position 3? Allowed, but I is not allowed? TRAIN has I? T-R-A-I-N -> I is excluded? So TRAIN is invalid.

 Similarly, ""TRAWL"" is valid? T-R-A-W-L -> has L? and W? 

 What about ""GRAND"": 
   G-R-A-N-D -> 
      R in pos2, A in pos3? Allowed? Yes. 
      Letters: G, R, A, N, D -> avoids E,I,S? Yes.

 GRAND is a word.

 I think any of BROAD, CRAMP, GRAND, TRAWL are possible.

 I'll pick BROAD because it uses common letters: B, R, O, A, D and covers O (a vowel) as well as D and B.

 Also, note that we might get feedback indicating if R is in position 2? and A in position 4? If one is at the right place, we'll get a ✓.

 Alternatively, if not, we'll get '-' or 'x' for R and A? But we know they are present? So at worst, we'll get '-' for R and A? Because they are in the word.

 But we are putting R in a new position (2) and A in a new position (4). So if the secret word has R in position 2, we get ✓? But if it has R in another position, we get '-' (because we put R in position 2 and then we know it's not at position 2? Actually, no: we know R is present? So if we put R in position 2 and it's not the right position, we'll get '-'. Similarly for A at position 4.

 Additionally, we test B, O, D.

 Considering that, BROAD seems fine.

 But let me also consider ""TARGO"" not a word.

 Another word: ""ROUND"": cannot because R in position 1? Disallowed? Because R in position 1 we know won't be correct? So avoid.

 How about ""ADORN"": 
   A-D-O-R-N -> 
        A in position 1? What do we know about A? We only know that A is not in position 2? Position 1 is allowed? Because nothing said position 1 cannot be A. 
        Then D, O, R in position 4, N.

 So ADORN: 
   Position 1: A (allowed? We haven't tested A in position 1? Only position 2? So yes, we can try A in position 1? But does the feedback say anything about position 1? In RAISE, the first position was R, and the second was A? So A wasn't in position 1? We don't know? Actually, we haven't tested A in position 1? So putting A in position 1 is possible? But wait: we know A is in the word? So if we put A in position 1 and it's correct, we'll get ✓? Or if it's not? Then we'll know.

 ADORN: A in pos1, D in pos2, O in pos3, R in pos4, N in pos5.

 This avoids position 2 for A? Yes, because here A is in position 1? And we know A is not in position 2? So position 1 is safe? Also, R is in position 4? Not position 1? So safe.

 So ADORN is also a candidate? ADORN: A, D, O, R, N -> letters new: D, O, N.

 Compared to BROAD: BROAD uses B, O, D? Same as?

 BROAD: B,R,O,A,D -> B and then O and D? Also N? No.

 ADORN has N? Which is common? Yes.

 Both avoid E,I,S.

 Which is better? ADORN has A in position 1 (which we haven't tried) and R in position 4 (new). Also, we test D, O, N.

 BROAD has R in position 2? And we haven't tried R in position 2? And A in position 4? And tests B.

 Personally, I think ADORN is better? Because it tests A in a new position (1) and R in position 4? And adds O, D, N? All common.

 BROAD: position 1: B? Not as common? But valid.

 Alternatively, let me consider ""PLANT"" again? But without R? Yes? We must include R? We cannot omit R? We must include the known yellow letters? Otherwise, we won't see if they appear? Actually, we know R and A are present? So we must include them? Else we might miss information. Especially we have limited guesses? So we should always include known present letters? Yes.

 Therefore, PLANT has A? But doesn't have R? So it's invalid? We must include both R and A.

 So only words that contain R and A and exclude E,I,S.

 So between ADORN and BROAD? ADORN: A at pos1? If in secret word, is A at pos1? We don't know? We only know it's not at pos2? So same for any position? We don't know? So ADORN seems fine? But ADORN has A at pos1? So we do test A? And R at pos4? Now, let me see: to maximize information? We are covering positions for A and R? We also cover D,O,N in new positions? 

 Now, BROAD: R at pos2 and A at pos4? So more focused on R and A? 

 Actually, both are fine? I'll go with ADORN.

 But note: ADORN has A in one of the positions? We know A could be anywhere except position 2? Position 1 is possible? So why not test that? 

 Also, ADORN gets more vowels? O? And we avoid duplication.

 So I decide to guess ""ADORN"".

 However, let me double-check: ADORN doesn't contain E,I,S? Correct? A,D,O,R,N -> none are E,I,S.

 It's a word? Yes, meaning to decorate.

 So <guess>ADORN</guess>

 Alternatively, if I choose BROAD: 
   If BROAD gets feedback:
      If R is in position2, we get ✓ for R? But we don't know? 
      But ADORN does not put R in a position we already know is wrong? For R, we only know position1 is wrong? So in ADORN, R in position4? We haven't tested position4? So it's fine.

 I'll go with ADORN.
</think>
Based on the feedback from Guess 1 (RAISE):  
- R and A are in the secret word but not in positions 1 or 2, respectively.  
- I, S, and E are not in the secret word.  

For the second guess, I need a word that:  
1. Includes R and A (since they are confirmed present).  
2. Excludes I, S, and E.  
3. Avoids placing R in position 1 or A in position 2.  
4. Uses distinct common letters to maximize new information.  

I chose ""ADORN"" because it:  
- Places A in position 1 (a new, untested position) and R in position 4 (avoiding the wrong position of 1).  
- Adds new common letters: D, O, and N (O is a frequent vowel, D and N are common consonants).  
- Avoids I, S, E and has no duplicate letters.  

This guess tests new positions for A and R while introducing three additional letters, providing a balanced setup for feedback.  

<guess>ADORN</guess>",ADORN,"We are given feedback for Guess 1: RAISE -> R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
 This means:
   R is in the word but in the wrong position.
   A is in the word but in the wrong position.
   I is not in the word.
   S is not in the word.
   E is not in the word.

 So, from this:
   - The secret word contains R and A, but not in the first and second positions respectively.
   - The word does not contain I, S, E.

 Since R is in the word but not position 1, it must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. However, note that in the feedback, R was in position 1 but marked wrong, so it can't be position 1. Similarly, A was in position 2 and marked wrong so it can't be in position 2.

 Also, the word does not have I, S, E.

 We must guess a new 5-letter word that must include R and A (since they are in the word), and exclude I, S, E.

 Moreover, we know R cannot be in position 1 and A cannot be in position 2.

 Let's think about possible placements for R and A.

 We need to choose a word that has R in a position other than 1, and A in a position other than 2.

 Since we have only one previous guess, we don't know much about the exact positions, so we can try to cover other common letters and also test new positions for R and A.

 Let's consider what letters are available. We know E, I, S are out. So we avoid these.

 Common letters left: T, O, N, L, U, D, C, M, P, etc.

 Since the word has R and A, we can include these and add other frequent letters.

 We have 6 tries, so we can try to get more information.

 We might try a word that has R and A in different positions and introduces new common letters.

 But note: we must not put R in position 1 and A in position 2.

 Let me try to list possibilities for R: positions 2,3,4,5
 For A: positions 1,3,4,5 (because it can't be 2)

 However, if we put A in position 1, that would be a possibility we haven't tested.

 We can try to put R in position 4 or 5 and A in position 1 or 3 or 4 or 5 (but not 2).

 One idea: start with A in a new position, and R in a new position, and add T, O, N which are common.

 Consider ""TAROT"": but that has T and O? Also, TAROT has repeated T? Actually, it has T twice? Let's check: T-A-R-O-T -> repeated T. Also, we need to avoid S, I, E.

 Another word: ""RADAR"" has repeated A and R? Not good because repeated letters and we don't know if the secret word has repeats.

 Since we don't know if there are repeats, it's safer to try a word with distinct letters.

 So, what about ""PLANT""? But we have E, I, S out? But P,L,A,N,T. But A is included? Yes. But where do we put R? We haven't included R. Remember R is present so we must include R in the guess because we know it's in the word.

 Important: we must include the letters that the feedback told us are present: R and A.

 So, the next guess must contain R and A, and must not contain I, S, E.

 And distinct letters if possible.

 So, let's think:

 We need to place R and A in positions other than R in 1 and A in 2.

 We can have:

 Position 1: not R (but can be A or another letter)
 Position 2: not A (but can be R? Wait, feedback from RAISE: R was in position 1 and was shown to be present but wrong position. So if we put R in position 2, that's allowed because we haven't tested R in position 2 before. Similarly, A in position 1 is allowed.

 However, note that R being present implies it is in the word somewhere, but we don't know where. Similarly for A.

 So, for guess 2, we can have:

 Option: put A in position 1 and R in position 3? Or R in position 5? Etc.

 Now, for the remaining letters: we need three more letters that are not I,S,E and are not duplicated.

 Let's choose common consonants and vowels excluding E,I,S.

 We have vowels: O,U,A (A we already have) but we need consonants? Actually, since A is included, we can use consonants.

 Common letters left: T, O, L, N, U, D, C, M, P, etc.

 We can form words with A and R and three of these.

 Possible words:

 - ""CAROM"": C-A-R-O-M -> letters C,A,R,O,M -> must check if valid. Carom is a word? Yes, meaning to strike and rebound. But it has R in position 3? And A in position 2? Wait, position 2 is A? But in feedback, we were told A is in the word but not in position 2? However, for the new guess, we don't know if position 2 might be the correct place? Wait no: In the previous feedback, A was in the second position (in RAISE) and marked as wrong position? That means the secret word has A, but it is not in position 2. So putting A in position 2 in a new guess is disallowed because we know A is not in position 2? Or can we still put it? No, because the feedback rule: the symbol ('-') means that the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, but it doesn't prevent us from guessing it again in the same position. However, logically, if we know that position 2 is wrong for A, we should avoid putting A in position 2 to avoid wasting a guess. Similarly, for R we know position 1 is wrong.

 Therefore, in the new guess, we should avoid:
 - R in position 1
 - A in position 2

 So for ""CAROM"": if I write C-A-R-O-M, then A is in position 2? That would be bad because we know A cannot be in position 2. So we should avoid that.

 Similarly, if I have a word starting with R (position 1) we know it's wrong.

 So, let me brainstorm words without R in 1 and without A in 2.

 Possibilities:

 Position 1: Any letter except R? Or except I,S,E? Actually any letter except R? We can put R elsewhere.

 How about ""FARCE""? F-A-R-C-E -> but E is excluded. We can't use E.

 Or ""YARTH""? Not a word.

 Word: ""OCTAL"" but missing R? We need R because we have to include the known letters.

 How about ""PARTY"": 
   P-A-R-T-Y -> 
      Position: 1: P (new, not R)
      Position 2: A -> this is position 2? But we cannot put A in position 2 because we know from feedback that A is not in position 2? So even though we are including A (which we know is in the word) we must avoid position 2 for A.

 Therefore, PARTY is invalid because A is in position 2.

 Another word: ""TRAWL"": 
   T-R-A-W-L -> 
      Position 1: T (new)
      Position 2: R -> but is R allowed in position 2? Let's see: in the feedback for RAISE, R was in position 1 and marked as wrong position. We don't know about position 2. So yes, R can be in position 2.

   But position 3: A -> which is position 3? That's not position 2 so it's allowed.

 So ""TRAWL"": 
   T (not E,I,S), R (in position 2: but we don't know if this is the correct position for R), A (position 3: safe because not position 2), W (new), L (new).
   Also, doesn't include I,S,E.

 But are we using the known presence? Yes, R and A are in the word.

 However, let's check if TRAWL is a word? Yes: to fish with a trawl net.

 Now, the problem: we are testing R in position 2 and A in position 3. But in the secret word, R and A might be in other positions. But that's okay because we might get feedback that they are not in these positions.

 Alternatively, we can avoid putting R and A in positions we suspect might be wrong? But we have no information except they are not in position 1 (R) and position 2 (A).

 An alternative: ""CARTY""? Not a word.

 ""DARAT""? Not a word.

 ""MAROON""? Too long.

 Another word: ""CRANK"": 
   C-R-A-N-K -> 
      Position 2: R? (allowed) 
      Position 3: A? (position 3 is not 2, so allowed) 
      But position 1: C? We haven't tested C. 
      But wait. In RAISE, we used R in pos1, A in pos2, etc. Now CRANK has R in pos2? Yes.

 But note: we know that E, I, S are out. N and K are new.

 CRANK is a word.

 However, we know that E, I, S are not in the word, but not that C is not? So including C is fine.

 But we are also missing R and A? We have R in position 2 and A in position 3.

 How about ""DRAWL"" but D-A? A in position 2? Avoid.

 Let me try to list:

 Without E,I,S and avoiding R in position 1 and A in position 2.

 How about:
   Position 1: T or L or O, etc.
   Position 2: R? (if we want to test R here) or other but not A? Actually we cannot put A in position 2, so we can put any other letter? But we want to get feedback on other positions.

 Another common word: ""ROAST"" but starts with R? That's position 1? We know R is not in position 1? So we must avoid putting R in position 1.

 Therefore, we cannot use ROAST.

 How about ""TAROT""? T-A-R-O-T -> A in position 2? Disallowed. And also repeated T? Not ideal.

 Perhaps ""BROAD"": 
   B-R-O-A-D -> 
        Position 2: R? Allowed.
        Position 4: A? Allowed (since not position 2).

 BROAD is a word? Yes.

 Also, BROAD: B, R, O, A, D -> new letters B, O, D, plus R and A.

 And avoids E,I,S.

 This seems better because we have R in position 2 and A in position 4? Positions: 
   1: B
   2: R
   3: O
   4: A
   5: D

 This puts R in a position we haven't tested (position 2) and A in position 4 (which we haven't tested). Also, we test O and D and B.

 But note: in RAISE, R was in position 1 and now we put R in position 2? We don't know if it might be correct? We don't have any information about position 2.

 Similarly, A was in position 2 in RAISE and now we put it in position 4.

 How about another word: ""CRAMP"": 
   C-R-A-M-P -> 
      R in pos2, A in pos3? Allowed? Yes.

 But CRAMP has M and P? Also good.

 CRAMP is a word.

 But BROAD might be better because it tests a vowel O? Or CRAMP tests consonants? 

 Since we don't know how many vowels are in the word? We know A is present and we avoided E,I (and O,U might be present).

 Given the feedback that RAISE had two yellows and three blacks, it's possible that the word has R, A, and three other letters.

 Let me think of the most frequent letters left: T, O, N, L, R, A are taken? R and A are in the word? So T, O, N, L are good choices to test.

 So perhaps BROAD (with O) or TRAIN? But TRAIN has A in position 3? Allowed, but I is not allowed? TRAIN has I? T-R-A-I-N -> I is excluded? So TRAIN is invalid.

 Similarly, ""TRAWL"" is valid? T-R-A-W-L -> has L? and W? 

 What about ""GRAND"": 
   G-R-A-N-D -> 
      R in pos2, A in pos3? Allowed? Yes. 
      Letters: G, R, A, N, D -> avoids E,I,S? Yes.

 GRAND is a word.

 I think any of BROAD, CRAMP, GRAND, TRAWL are possible.

 I'll pick BROAD because it uses common letters: B, R, O, A, D and covers O (a vowel) as well as D and B.

 Also, note that we might get feedback indicating if R is in position 2? and A in position 4? If one is at the right place, we'll get a ✓.

 Alternatively, if not, we'll get '-' or 'x' for R and A? But we know they are present? So at worst, we'll get '-' for R and A? Because they are in the word.

 But we are putting R in a new position (2) and A in a new position (4). So if the secret word has R in position 2, we get ✓? But if it has R in another position, we get '-' (because we put R in position 2 and then we know it's not at position 2? Actually, no: we know R is present? So if we put R in position 2 and it's not the right position, we'll get '-'. Similarly for A at position 4.

 Additionally, we test B, O, D.

 Considering that, BROAD seems fine.

 But let me also consider ""TARGO"" not a word.

 Another word: ""ROUND"": cannot because R in position 1? Disallowed? Because R in position 1 we know won't be correct? So avoid.

 How about ""ADORN"": 
   A-D-O-R-N -> 
        A in position 1? What do we know about A? We only know that A is not in position 2? Position 1 is allowed? Because nothing said position 1 cannot be A. 
        Then D, O, R in position 4, N.

 So ADORN: 
   Position 1: A (allowed? We haven't tested A in position 1? Only position 2? So yes, we can try A in position 1? But does the feedback say anything about position 1? In RAISE, the first position was R, and the second was A? So A wasn't in position 1? We don't know? Actually, we haven't tested A in position 1? So putting A in position 1 is possible? But wait: we know A is in the word? So if we put A in position 1 and it's correct, we'll get ✓? Or if it's not? Then we'll know.

 ADORN: A in pos1, D in pos2, O in pos3, R in pos4, N in pos5.

 This avoids position 2 for A? Yes, because here A is in position 1? And we know A is not in position 2? So position 1 is safe? Also, R is in position 4? Not position 1? So safe.

 So ADORN is also a candidate? ADORN: A, D, O, R, N -> letters new: D, O, N.

 Compared to BROAD: BROAD uses B, O, D? Same as?

 BROAD: B,R,O,A,D -> B and then O and D? Also N? No.

 ADORN has N? Which is common? Yes.

 Both avoid E,I,S.

 Which is better? ADORN has A in position 1 (which we haven't tried) and R in position 4 (new). Also, we test D, O, N.

 BROAD has R in position 2? And we haven't tried R in position 2? And A in position 4? And tests B.

 Personally, I think ADORN is better? Because it tests A in a new position (1) and R in position 4? And adds O, D, N? All common.

 BROAD: position 1: B? Not as common? But valid.

 Alternatively, let me consider ""PLANT"" again? But without R? Yes? We must include R? We cannot omit R? We must include the known yellow letters? Otherwise, we won't see if they appear? Actually, we know R and A are present? So we must include them? Else we might miss information. Especially we have limited guesses? So we should always include known present letters? Yes.

 Therefore, PLANT has A? But doesn't have R? So it's invalid? We must include both R and A.

 So only words that contain R and A and exclude E,I,S.

 So between ADORN and BROAD? ADORN: A at pos1? If in secret word, is A at pos1? We don't know? We only know it's not at pos2? So same for any position? We don't know? So ADORN seems fine? But ADORN has A at pos1? So we do test A? And R at pos4? Now, let me see: to maximize information? We are covering positions for A and R? We also cover D,O,N in new positions? 

 Now, BROAD: R at pos2 and A at pos4? So more focused on R and A? 

 Actually, both are fine? I'll go with ADORN.

 But note: ADORN has A in one of the positions? We know A could be anywhere except position 2? Position 1 is possible? So why not test that? 

 Also, ADORN gets more vowels? O? And we avoid duplication.

 So I decide to guess ""ADORN"".

 However, let me double-check: ADORN doesn't contain E,I,S? Correct? A,D,O,R,N -> none are E,I,S.

 It's a word? Yes, meaning to decorate.

 So <guess>ADORN</guess>

 Alternatively, if I choose BROAD: 
   If BROAD gets feedback:
      If R is in position2, we get ✓ for R? But we don't know? 
      But ADORN does not put R in a position we already know is wrong? For R, we only know position1 is wrong? So in ADORN, R in position4? We haven't tested position4? So it's fine.

 I'll go with ADORN.Based on the feedback from Guess 1 (RAISE):  
- R and A are in the secret word but not in positions 1 or 2, respectively.  
- I, S, and E are not in the secret word.  

For the second guess, I need a word that:  
1. Includes R and A (since they are confirmed present).  
2. Excludes I, S, and E.  
3. Avoids placing R in position 1 or A in position 2.  
4. Uses distinct common letters to maximize new information.  

I chose ""ADORN"" because it:  
- Places A in position 1 (a new, untested position) and R in position 4 (avoiding the wrong position of 1).  
- Adds new common letters: D, O, and N (O is a frequent vowel, D and N are common consonants).

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>First, I'm starting the game and need to make my first guess. Since it's the first guess, I have no prior feedback, so I should choose a word that maximizes the information I get.

A common strategy in Wordle is to start with words that have a good mix of common vowels and consonants. This helps in identifying which letters are present or absent.

I recall that words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ROAST"" are popular starters because they contain frequent letters. But I should pick one that covers different possibilities.

Let me think about letter frequency in English words. According to common knowledge, vowels like E, A, I, O, U are frequent, and consonants like R, S, T, L, N are also common.

To cover multiple common letters, words like ""ARISE"" or ""RAISE"" might be good. But I want to maximize coverage.

Perhaps ""CRATE"" – it has C, R, A, T, E. That's one vowel and four consonants.

Another one is ""SLICE"" with S, L, I, C, E.

I think ""CRANE"" is a solid first guess. Let me confirm: C, R, A, N, E. That includes three vowels? A and E are vowels, C is consonant, R consonant, N consonant. Actually, two vowels: A and E.

A and E are vowels, but I is also common. Maybe ""RAISE"" is better: R, A, I, S, E – that has three vowels: A, I, E.

Vowels: A, E, I, O, U. In ""RAISE"", A, I, E are vowels, so three vowels. In ""CRANE"", A and E are vowels, so two vowels. More vowels might be better for testing.

But consonants are important too. Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N.

So, a word like ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E – that's S, L, T consonants and A, E vowels.

""ROAST"" has R, O, A, S, T – R, S, T consonants and O, A vowels.

I should aim for a word with no repeating letters to maximize distinct letters.

Yes, all guesses should have unique letters to get more information.

So, for first guess, priority is: common letters, no repeats.

Let's list some top starters based on Wordle strategies:

- ""CRANE""

- ""SLATE""

- ""RAISE""

- ""ROATE"" (not a common word, but used)

""ADIEU"" has A, D, I, E, U – four vowels, but D might be less common.

I think ""SOARE"" is used, but not common.

I'll go with ""CRANE"" for my first guess. It has C, R, A, N, E – all common letters, and C and N might test less frequent ones.

But according to frequency, E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U are top.

E is most frequent.

So words with E, A, R, T, S are good.

""SALET"" or ""CRATE"".

I think ""CRANE"" is fine.

To be systematic, I'll choose ""RAISE"": R, A, I, S, E – includes R, A, I, S, E – all high frequency.

R, A, S are top consonants, E is top vowel, I is vowel.

Yes, ""RAISE"" seems excellent.

In the rules, I need to output in specific format.

So, for my first guess, I'll guess ""RAISE"".

But let me confirm it's a valid 5-letter word. ""Raise"" – yes, it's common.

Perhaps ""ARISE"" is similar.

I'll go with ""RAISE"".For the first guess in Wordle, I need to choose a word that maximizes the potential for useful feedback. Since there's no prior information, I should select a word with common letters to increase the chances of identifying correct letters or positions. Common starting words often include a mix of frequent vowels and consonants, with all letters distinct to cover more possibilities.

Key considerations:
- Letter frequency in English: E, A, R, I, S are among the most common (based on corpus data).
- Including multiple vowels can help test for essential word structure.
- Words like ""RAISE"", ""CRANE"", or ""SLATE"" are popular starters for this reason.

After evaluating options:
- ""RAISE"" contains R, A, I, S, E – all high-frequency letters.
- It has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).
- No repeated letters, so each position provides unique information.
- It's a valid 5-letter English word.

This guess should provide good feedback on whether any of these letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for Guess 1: RAISE -> R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
 This means:
   R is in the word but in the wrong position.
   A is in the word but in the wrong position.
   I is not in the word.
   S is not in the word.
   E is not in the word.

 So, from this:
   - The secret word contains R and A, but not in the first and second positions respectively.
   - The word does not contain I, S, E.

 Since R is in the word but not position 1, it must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. However, note that in the feedback, R was in position 1 but marked wrong, so it can't be position 1. Similarly, A was in position 2 and marked wrong so it can't be in position 2.

 Also, the word does not have I, S, E.

 We must guess a new 5-letter word that must include R and A (since they are in the word), and exclude I, S, E.

 Moreover, we know R cannot be in position 1 and A cannot be in position 2.

 Let's think about possible placements for R and A.

 We need to choose a word that has R in a position other than 1, and A in a position other than 2.

 Since we have only one previous guess, we don't know much about the exact positions, so we can try to cover other common letters and also test new positions for R and A.

 Let's consider what letters are available. We know E, I, S are out. So we avoid these.

 Common letters left: T, O, N, L, U, D, C, M, P, etc.

 Since the word has R and A, we can include these and add other frequent letters.

 We have 6 tries, so we can try to get more information.

 We might try a word that has R and A in different positions and introduces new common letters.

 But note: we must not put R in position 1 and A in position 2.

 Let me try to list possibilities for R: positions 2,3,4,5
 For A: positions 1,3,4,5 (because it can't be 2)

 However, if we put A in position 1, that would be a possibility we haven't tested.

 We can try to put R in position 4 or 5 and A in position 1 or 3 or 4 or 5 (but not 2).

 One idea: start with A in a new position, and R in a new position, and add T, O, N which are common.

 Consider ""TAROT"": but that has T and O? Also, TAROT has repeated T? Actually, it has T twice? Let's check: T-A-R-O-T -> repeated T. Also, we need to avoid S, I, E.

 Another word: ""RADAR"" has repeated A and R? Not good because repeated letters and we don't know if the secret word has repeats.

 Since we don't know if there are repeats, it's safer to try a word with distinct letters.

 So, what about ""PLANT""? But we have E, I, S out? But P,L,A,N,T. But A is included? Yes. But where do we put R? We haven't included R. Remember R is present so we must include R in the guess because we know it's in the word.

 Important: we must include the letters that the feedback told us are present: R and A.

 So, the next guess must contain R and A, and must not contain I, S, E.

 And distinct letters if possible.

 So, let's think:

 We need to place R and A in positions other than R in 1 and A in 2.

 We can have:

 Position 1: not R (but can be A or another letter)
 Position 2: not A (but can be R? Wait, feedback from RAISE: R was in position 1 and was shown to be present but wrong position. So if we put R in position 2, that's allowed because we haven't tested R in position 2 before. Similarly, A in position 1 is allowed.

 However, note that R being present implies it is in the word somewhere, but we don't know where. Similarly for A.

 So, for guess 2, we can have:

 Option: put A in position 1 and R in position 3? Or R in position 5? Etc.

 Now, for the remaining letters: we need three more letters that are not I,S,E and are not duplicated.

 Let's choose common consonants and vowels excluding E,I,S.

 We have vowels: O,U,A (A we already have) but we need consonants? Actually, since A is included, we can use consonants.

 Common letters left: T, O, L, N, U, D, C, M, P, etc.

 We can form words with A and R and three of these.

 Possible words:

 - ""CAROM"": C-A-R-O-M -> letters C,A,R,O,M -> must check if valid. Carom is a word? Yes, meaning to strike and rebound. But it has R in position 3? And A in position 2? Wait, position 2 is A? But in feedback, we were told A is in the word but not in position 2? However, for the new guess, we don't know if position 2 might be the correct place? Wait no: In the previous feedback, A was in the second position (in RAISE) and marked as wrong position? That means the secret word has A, but it is not in position 2. So putting A in position 2 in a new guess is disallowed because we know A is not in position 2? Or can we still put it? No, because the feedback rule: the symbol ('-') means that the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, but it doesn't prevent us from guessing it again in the same position. However, logically, if we know that position 2 is wrong for A, we should avoid putting A in position 2 to avoid wasting a guess. Similarly, for R we know position 1 is wrong.

 Therefore, in the new guess, we should avoid:
 - R in position 1
 - A in position 2

 So for ""CAROM"": if I write C-A-R-O-M, then A is in position 2? That would be bad because we know A cannot be in position 2. So we should avoid that.

 Similarly, if I have a word starting with R (position 1) we know it's wrong.

 So, let me brainstorm words without R in 1 and without A in 2.

 Possibilities:

 Position 1: Any letter except R? Or except I,S,E? Actually any letter except R? We can put R elsewhere.

 How about ""FARCE""? F-A-R-C-E -> but E is excluded. We can't use E.

 Or ""YARTH""? Not a word.

 Word: ""OCTAL"" but missing R? We need R because we have to include the known letters.

 How about ""PARTY"": 
   P-A-R-T-Y -> 
      Position: 1: P (new, not R)
      Position 2: A -> this is position 2? But we cannot put A in position 2 because we know from feedback that A is not in position 2? So even though we are including A (which we know is in the word) we must avoid position 2 for A.

 Therefore, PARTY is invalid because A is in position 2.

 Another word: ""TRAWL"": 
   T-R-A-W-L -> 
      Position 1: T (new)
      Position 2: R -> but is R allowed in position 2? Let's see: in the feedback for RAISE, R was in position 1 and marked as wrong position. We don't know about position 2. So yes, R can be in position 2.

   But position 3: A -> which is position 3? That's not position 2 so it's allowed.

 So ""TRAWL"": 
   T (not E,I,S), R (in position 2: but we don't know if this is the correct position for R), A (position 3: safe because not position 2), W (new), L (new).
   Also, doesn't include I,S,E.

 But are we using the known presence? Yes, R and A are in the word.

 However, let's check if TRAWL is a word? Yes: to fish with a trawl net.

 Now, the problem: we are testing R in position 2 and A in position 3. But in the secret word, R and A might be in other positions. But that's okay because we might get feedback that they are not in these positions.

 Alternatively, we can avoid putting R and A in positions we suspect might be wrong? But we have no information except they are not in position 1 (R) and position 2 (A).

 An alternative: ""CARTY""? Not a word.

 ""DARAT""? Not a word.

 ""MAROON""? Too long.

 Another word: ""CRANK"": 
   C-R-A-N-K -> 
      Position 2: R? (allowed) 
      Position 3: A? (position 3 is not 2, so allowed) 
      But position 1: C? We haven't tested C. 
      But wait. In RAISE, we used R in pos1, A in pos2, etc. Now CRANK has R in pos2? Yes.

 But note: we know that E, I, S are out. N and K are new.

 CRANK is a word.

 However, we know that E, I, S are not in the word, but not that C is not? So including C is fine.

 But we are also missing R and A? We have R in position 2 and A in position 3.

 How about ""DRAWL"" but D-A? A in position 2? Avoid.

 Let me try to list:

 Without E,I,S and avoiding R in position 1 and A in position 2.

 How about:
   Position 1: T or L or O, etc.
   Position 2: R? (if we want to test R here) or other but not A? Actually we cannot put A in position 2, so we can put any other letter? But we want to get feedback on other positions.

 Another common word: ""ROAST"" but starts with R? That's position 1? We know R is not in position 1? So we must avoid putting R in position 1.

 Therefore, we cannot use ROAST.

 How about ""TAROT""? T-A-R-O-T -> A in position 2? Disallowed. And also repeated T? Not ideal.

 Perhaps ""BROAD"": 
   B-R-O-A-D -> 
        Position 2: R? Allowed.
        Position 4: A? Allowed (since not position 2).

 BROAD is a word? Yes.

 Also, BROAD: B, R, O, A, D -> new letters B, O, D, plus R and A.

 And avoids E,I,S.

 This seems better because we have R in position 2 and A in position 4? Positions: 
   1: B
   2: R
   3: O
   4: A
   5: D

 This puts R in a position we haven't tested (position 2) and A in position 4 (which we haven't tested). Also, we test O and D and B.

 But note: in RAISE, R was in position 1 and now we put R in position 2? We don't know if it might be correct? We don't have any information about position 2.

 Similarly, A was in position 2 in RAISE and now we put it in position 4.

 How about another word: ""CRAMP"": 
   C-R-A-M-P -> 
      R in pos2, A in pos3? Allowed? Yes.

 But CRAMP has M and P? Also good.

 CRAMP is a word.

 But BROAD might be better because it tests a vowel O? Or CRAMP tests consonants? 

 Since we don't know how many vowels are in the word? We know A is present and we avoided E,I (and O,U might be present).

 Given the feedback that RAISE had two yellows and three blacks, it's possible that the word has R, A, and three other letters.

 Let me think of the most frequent letters left: T, O, N, L, R, A are taken? R and A are in the word? So T, O, N, L are good choices to test.

 So perhaps BROAD (with O) or TRAIN? But TRAIN has A in position 3? Allowed, but I is not allowed? TRAIN has I? T-R-A-I-N -> I is excluded? So TRAIN is invalid.

 Similarly, ""TRAWL"" is valid? T-R-A-W-L -> has L? and W? 

 What about ""GRAND"": 
   G-R-A-N-D -> 
      R in pos2, A in pos3? Allowed? Yes. 
      Letters: G, R, A, N, D -> avoids E,I,S? Yes.

 GRAND is a word.

 I think any of BROAD, CRAMP, GRAND, TRAWL are possible.

 I'll pick BROAD because it uses common letters: B, R, O, A, D and covers O (a vowel) as well as D and B.

 Also, note that we might get feedback indicating if R is in position 2? and A in position 4? If one is at the right place, we'll get a ✓.

 Alternatively, if not, we'll get '-' or 'x' for R and A? But we know they are present? So at worst, we'll get '-' for R and A? Because they are in the word.

 But we are putting R in a new position (2) and A in a new position (4). So if the secret word has R in position 2, we get ✓? But if it has R in another position, we get '-' (because we put R in position 2 and then we know it's not at position 2? Actually, no: we know R is present? So if we put R in position 2 and it's not the right position, we'll get '-'. Similarly for A at position 4.

 Additionally, we test B, O, D.

 Considering that, BROAD seems fine.

 But let me also consider ""TARGO"" not a word.

 Another word: ""ROUND"": cannot because R in position 1? Disallowed? Because R in position 1 we know won't be correct? So avoid.

 How about ""ADORN"": 
   A-D-O-R-N -> 
        A in position 1? What do we know about A? We only know that A is not in position 2? Position 1 is allowed? Because nothing said position 1 cannot be A. 
        Then D, O, R in position 4, N.

 So ADORN: 
   Position 1: A (allowed? We haven't tested A in position 1? Only position 2? So yes, we can try A in position 1? But does the feedback say anything about position 1? In RAISE, the first position was R, and the second was A? So A wasn't in position 1? We don't know? Actually, we haven't tested A in position 1? So putting A in position 1 is possible? But wait: we know A is in the word? So if we put A in position 1 and it's correct, we'll get ✓? Or if it's not? Then we'll know.

 ADORN: A in pos1, D in pos2, O in pos3, R in pos4, N in pos5.

 This avoids position 2 for A? Yes, because here A is in position 1? And we know A is not in position 2? So position 1 is safe? Also, R is in position 4? Not position 1? So safe.

 So ADORN is also a candidate? ADORN: A, D, O, R, N -> letters new: D, O, N.

 Compared to BROAD: BROAD uses B, O, D? Same as?

 BROAD: B,R,O,A,D -> B and then O and D? Also N? No.

 ADORN has N? Which is common? Yes.

 Both avoid E,I,S.

 Which is better? ADORN has A in position 1 (which we haven't tried) and R in position 4 (new). Also, we test D, O, N.

 BROAD has R in position 2? And we haven't tried R in position 2? And A in position 4? And tests B.

 Personally, I think ADORN is better? Because it tests A in a new position (1) and R in position 4? And adds O, D, N? All common.

 BROAD: position 1: B? Not as common? But valid.

 Alternatively, let me consider ""PLANT"" again? But without R? Yes? We must include R? We cannot omit R? We must include the known yellow letters? Otherwise, we won't see if they appear? Actually, we know R and A are present? So we must include them? Else we might miss information. Especially we have limited guesses? So we should always include known present letters? Yes.

 Therefore, PLANT has A? But doesn't have R? So it's invalid? We must include both R and A.

 So only words that contain R and A and exclude E,I,S.

 So between ADORN and BROAD? ADORN: A at pos1? If in secret word, is A at pos1? We don't know? We only know it's not at pos2? So same for any position? We don't know? So ADORN seems fine? But ADORN has A at pos1? So we do test A? And R at pos4? Now, let me see: to maximize information? We are covering positions for A and R? We also cover D,O,N in new positions? 

 Now, BROAD: R at pos2 and A at pos4? So more focused on R and A? 

 Actually, both are fine? I'll go with ADORN.

 But note: ADORN has A in one of the positions? We know A could be anywhere except position 2? Position 1 is possible? So why not test that? 

 Also, ADORN gets more vowels? O? And we avoid duplication.

 So I decide to guess ""ADORN"".

 However, let me double-check: ADORN doesn't contain E,I,S? Correct? A,D,O,R,N -> none are E,I,S.

 It's a word? Yes, meaning to decorate.

 So <guess>ADORN</guess>

 Alternatively, if I choose BROAD: 
   If BROAD gets feedback:
      If R is in position2, we get ✓ for R? But we don't know? 
      But ADORN does not put R in a position we already know is wrong? For R, we only know position1 is wrong? So in ADORN, R in position4? We haven't tested position4? So it's fine.

 I'll go with ADORN.Based on the feedback from Guess 1 (RAISE):  
- R and A are in the secret word but not in positions 1 or 2, respectively.  
- I, S, and E are not in the secret word.  

For the second guess, I need a word that:  
1. Includes R and A (since they are confirmed present).  
2. Excludes I, S, and E.  
3. Avoids placing R in position 1 or A in position 2.  
4. Uses distinct common letters to maximize new information.  

I chose ""ADORN"" because it:  
- Places A in position 1 (a new, untested position) and R in position 4 (avoiding the wrong position of 1).  
- Adds new common letters: D, O, and N (O is a frequent vowel, D and N are common consonants).  
- Avoids I, S, E and has no duplicate letters.  

This guess tests new positions for A and R while introducing three additional letters, providing a balanced setup for feedback.

Common starting words often include a mix of frequent vowels and consonants, with all letters distinct to cover more possibilities.\n\nKey considerations:\n- Letter frequency in English: E, A, R, I, S are among the most common (based on corpus data).\n- Including multiple vowels can help test for essential word structure.\n- Words like ""RAISE"", ""CRANE"", or ""SLATE"" are popular starters for this reason.\n\nAfter evaluating options:\n- ""RAISE"" contains R, A, I, S, E – all high-frequency letters.\n- It has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).\n- No repeated letters, so each position provides unique information.\n- It\'s a valid 5-letter English word.\n\nThis guess should provide good feedback on whether any of these letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.\n\n<guess>RAISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for Guess 1: RAISE -> R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)\n This means:\n   R is in the word but in the wrong position.\n   A is in the word but in the wrong position.\n   I is not in the word.\n   S is not in the word.\n   E is not in the word.\n\n So, from this:\n   - The secret word contains R and A, but not in the first and second positions respectively.\n   - The word does not contain I, S, E.\n\n Since R is in the word but not position 1, it must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. However, note that in the feedback, R was in position 1 but marked wrong, so it can\'t be position 1. Similarly, A was in position 2 and marked wrong so it can\'t be in position 2.\n\n Also, the word does not have I, S, E.\n\n We must guess a new 5-letter word that must include R and A (since they are in the word), and exclude I, S, E.\n\n Moreover, we know R cannot be in position 1 and A cannot be in position 2.\n\n Let\'s think about possible placements for R and A.\n\n We need to choose a word that has R in a position other than 1, and A in a position other than 2.\n\n Since we have only one previous guess, we don\'t know much about the exact positions, so we can try to cover other common letters and also test new positions for R and A.\n\n Let\'s consider what letters are available. We know E, I, S are out. So we avoid these.\n\n Common letters left: T, O, N, L, U, D, C, M, P, etc.\n\n Since the word has R and A, we can include these and add other frequent letters.\n\n We have 6 tries, so we can try to get more information.\n\n We might try a word that has R and A in different positions and introduces new common letters.\n\n But note: we must not put R in position 1 and A in position 2.\n\n Let me try to list possibilities for R: positions 2,3,4,5\n For A: positions 1,3,4,5 (because it can\'t be 2)\n\n However, if we put A in position 1, that would be a possibility we haven\'t tested.\n\n We can try to put R in position 4 or 5 and A in position 1 or 3 or 4 or 5 (but not 2).\n\n One idea: start with A in a new position, and R in a new position, and add T, O, N which are common.\n\n Consider ""TAROT"": but that has T and O? Also, TAROT has repeated T? Actually, it has T twice? Let\'s check: T-A-R-O-T -> repeated T. Also, we need to avoid S, I, E.\n\n Another word: ""RADAR"" has repeated A and R? Not good because repeated letters and we don\'t know if the secret word has repeats.\n\n Since we don\'t know if there are repeats, it\'s safer to try a word with distinct letters.\n\n So, what about ""PLANT""? But we have E, I, S out? But P,L,A,N,T. But A is included? Yes. But where do we put R? We haven\'t included R. Remember R is present so we must include R in the guess because we know it\'s in the word.\n\n Important: we must include the letters that the feedback told us are present: R and A.\n\n So, the next guess must contain R and A, and must not contain I, S, E.\n\n And distinct letters if possible.\n\n So, let\'s think:\n\n We need to place R and A in positions other than R in 1 and A in 2.\n\n We can have:\n\n Position 1: not R (but can be A or another letter)\n Position 2: not A (but can be R? Wait, feedback from RAISE: R was in position 1 and was shown to be present but wrong position. So if we put R in position 2, that\'s allowed because we haven\'t tested R in position 2 before. Similarly, A in position 1 is allowed.\n\n However, note that R being present implies it is in the word somewhere, but we don\'t know where. Similarly for A.\n\n So, for guess 2, we can have:\n\n Option: put A in position 1 and R in position 3? Or R in position 5? Etc.\n\n Now, for the remaining letters: we need three more letters that are not I,S,E and are not duplicated.\n\n Let\'s choose common consonants and vowels excluding E,I,S.\n\n We have vowels: O,U,A (A we already have) but we need consonants? Actually, since A is included, we can use consonants.\n\n Common letters left: T, O, L, N, U, D, C, M, P, etc.\n\n We can form words with A and R and three of these.\n\n Possible words:\n\n - ""CAROM"": C-A-R-O-M -> letters C,A,R,O,M -> must check if valid. Carom is a word? Yes, meaning to strike and rebound. But it has R in position 3? And A in position 2? Wait, position 2 is A? But in feedback, we were told A is in the word but not in position 2? However, for the new guess, we don\'t know if position 2 might be the correct place? Wait no: In the previous feedback, A was in the second position (in RAISE) and marked as wrong position? That means the secret word has A, but it is not in position 2. So putting A in position 2 in a new guess is disallowed because we know A is not in position 2? Or can we still put it? No, because the feedback rule: the symbol (\'-\') means that the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, but it doesn\'t prevent us from guessing it again in the same position. However, logically, if we know that position 2 is wrong for A, we should avoid putting A in position 2 to avoid wasting a guess. Similarly, for R we know position 1 is wrong.\n\n Therefore, in the new guess, we should avoid:\n - R in position 1\n - A in position 2\n\n So for ""CAROM"": if I write C-A-R-O-M, then A is in position 2? That would be bad because we know A cannot be in position 2. So we should avoid that.\n\n Similarly, if I have a word starting with R (position 1) we know it\'s wrong.\n\n So, let me brainstorm words without R in 1 and without A in 2.\n\n Possibilities:\n\n Position 1: Any letter except R? Or except I,S,E? Actually any letter except R? We can put R elsewhere.\n\n How about ""FARCE""? F-A-R-C-E -> but E is excluded. We can\'t use E.\n\n Or ""YARTH""? Not a word.\n\n Word: ""OCTAL"" but missing R? We need R because we have to include the known letters.\n\n How about ""PARTY"": \n   P-A-R-T-Y -> \n      Position: 1: P (new, not R)\n      Position 2: A -> this is position 2? But we cannot put A in position 2 because we know from feedback that A is not in position 2? So even though we are including A (which we know is in the word) we must avoid position 2 for A.\n\n Therefore, PARTY is invalid because A is in position 2.\n\n Another word: ""TRAWL"": \n   T-R-A-W-L -> \n      Position 1: T (new)\n      Position 2: R -> but is R allowed in position 2? Let\'s see: in the feedback for RAISE, R was in position 1 and marked as wrong position. We don\'t know about position 2. So yes, R can be in position 2.\n\n   But position 3: A -> which is position 3? That\'s not position 2 so it\'s allowed.\n\n So ""TRAWL"": \n   T (not E,I,S), R (in position 2: but we don\'t know if this is the correct position for R), A (position 3: safe because not position 2), W (new), L (new).\n   Also, doesn\'t include I,S,E.\n\n But are we using the known presence? Yes, R and A are in the word.\n\n However, let\'s check if TRAWL is a word? Yes: to fish with a trawl net.\n\n Now, the problem: we are testing R in position 2 and A in position 3. But in the secret word, R and A might be in other positions. But that\'s okay because we might get feedback that they are not in these positions.\n\n Alternatively, we can avoid putting R and A in positions we suspect might be wrong? But we have no information except they are not in position 1 (R) and position 2 (A).\n\n An alternative: ""CARTY""? Not a word.\n\n ""DARAT""? Not a word.\n\n ""MAROON""? Too long.\n\n Another word: ""CRANK"": \n   C-R-A-N-K -> \n      Position 2: R? (allowed) \n      Position 3: A? (position 3 is not 2, so allowed) \n      But position 1: C? We haven\'t tested C. \n      But wait. In RAISE, we used R in pos1, A in pos2, etc. Now CRANK has R in pos2? Yes.\n\n But note: we know that E, I, S are out. N and K are new.\n\n CRANK is a word.\n\n However, we know that E, I, S are not in the word, but not that C is not? So including C is fine.\n\n But we are also missing R and A? We have R in position 2 and A in position 3.\n\n How about ""DRAWL"" but D-A? A in position 2? Avoid.\n\n Let me try to list:\n\n Without E,I,S and avoiding R in position 1 and A in position 2.\n\n How about:\n   Position 1: T or L or O, etc.\n   Position 2: R? (if we want to test R here) or other but not A? Actually we cannot put A in position 2, so we can put any other letter? But we want to get feedback on other positions.\n\n Another common word: ""ROAST"" but starts with R? That\'s position 1? We know R is not in position 1? So we must avoid putting R in position 1.\n\n Therefore, we cannot use ROAST.\n\n How about ""TAROT""? T-A-R-O-T -> A in position 2? Disallowed. And also repeated T? Not ideal.\n\n Perhaps ""BROAD"": \n   B-R-O-A-D -> \n        Position 2: R? Allowed.\n        Position 4: A? Allowed (since not position 2).\n\n BROAD is a word? Yes.\n\n Also, BROAD: B, R, O, A, D -> new letters B, O, D, plus R and A.\n\n And avoids E,I,S.\n\n This seems better because we have R in position 2 and A in position 4? Positions: \n   1: B\n   2: R\n   3: O\n   4: A\n   5: D\n\n This puts R in a position we haven\'t tested (position 2) and A in position 4 (which we haven\'t tested). Also, we test O and D and B.\n\n But note: in RAISE, R was in position 1 and now we put R in position 2? We don\'t know if it might be correct? We don\'t have any information about position 2.\n\n Similarly, A was in position 2 in RAISE and now we put it in position 4.\n\n How about another word: ""CRAMP"": \n   C-R-A-M-P -> \n      R in pos2, A in pos3? Allowed? Yes.\n\n But CRAMP has M and P? Also good.\n\n CRAMP is a word.\n\n But BROAD might be better because it tests a vowel O? Or CRAMP tests consonants? \n\n Since we don\'t know how many vowels are in the word? We know A is present and we avoided E,I (and O,U might be present).\n\n Given the feedback that RAISE had two yellows and three blacks, it\'s possible that the word has R, A, and three other letters.\n\n Let me think of the most frequent letters left: T, O, N, L, R, A are taken? R and A are in the word? So T, O, N, L are good choices to test.\n\n So perhaps BROAD (with O) or TRAIN? But TRAIN has A in position 3? Allowed, but I is not allowed? TRAIN has I? T-R-A-I-N -> I is excluded? So TRAIN is invalid.\n\n Similarly, ""TRAWL"" is valid? T-R-A-W-L -> has L? and W? \n\n What about ""GRAND"": \n   G-R-A-N-D -> \n      R in pos2, A in pos3? Allowed? Yes. \n      Letters: G, R, A, N, D -> avoids E,I,S? Yes.\n\n GRAND is a word.\n\n I think any of BROAD, CRAMP, GRAND, TRAWL are possible.\n\n I\'ll pick BROAD because it uses common letters: B, R, O, A, D and covers O (a vowel) as well as D and B.\n\n Also, note that we might get feedback indicating if R is in position 2? and A in position 4? If one is at the right place, we\'ll get a ✓.\n\n Alternatively, if not, we\'ll get \'-\' or \'x\' for R and A? But we know they are present? So at worst, we\'ll get \'-\' for R and A? Because they are in the word.\n\n But we are putting R in a new position (2) and A in a new position (4). So if the secret word has R in position 2, we get ✓? But if it has R in another position, we get \'-\' (because we put R in position 2 and then we know it\'s not at position 2? Actually, no: we know R is present? So if we put R in position 2 and it\'s not the right position, we\'ll get \'-\'. Similarly for A at position 4.\n\n Additionally, we test B, O, D.\n\n Considering that, BROAD seems fine.\n\n But let me also consider ""TARGO"" not a word.\n\n Another word: ""ROUND"": cannot because R in position 1? Disallowed? Because R in position 1 we know won\'t be correct? So avoid.\n\n How about ""ADORN"": \n   A-D-O-R-N -> \n        A in position 1? What do we know about A? We only know that A is not in position 2? Position 1 is allowed? Because nothing said position 1 cannot be A. \n        Then D, O, R in position 4, N.\n\n So ADORN: \n   Position 1: A (allowed? We haven\'t tested A in position 1? Only position 2? So yes, we can try A in position 1? But does the feedback say anything about position 1? In RAISE, the first position was R, and the second was A? So A wasn\'t in position 1? We don\'t know? Actually, we haven\'t tested A in position 1? So putting A in position 1 is possible? But wait: we know A is in the word? So if we put A in position 1 and it\'s correct, we\'ll get ✓? Or if it\'s not? Then we\'ll know.\n\n ADORN: A in pos1, D in pos2, O in pos3, R in pos4, N in pos5.\n\n This avoids position 2 for A? Yes, because here A is in position 1? And we know A is not in position 2? So position 1 is safe? Also, R is in position 4? Not position 1? So safe.\n\n So ADORN is also a candidate? ADORN: A, D, O, R, N -> letters new: D, O, N.\n\n Compared to BROAD: BROAD uses B, O, D? Same as?\n\n BROAD: B,R,O,A,D -> B and then O and D? Also N? No.\n\n ADORN has N? Which is common? Yes.\n\n Both avoid E,I,S.\n\n Which is better? ADORN has A in position 1 (which we haven\'t tried) and R in position 4 (new). Also, we test D, O, N.\n\n BROAD has R in position 2? And we haven\'t tried R in position 2? And A in position 4? And tests B.\n\n Personally, I think ADORN is better? Because it tests A in a new position (1) and R in position 4? And adds O, D, N? All common.\n\n BROAD: position 1: B? Not as common? But valid.\n\n Alternatively, let me consider ""PLANT"" again? But without R? Yes? We must include R? We cannot omit R? We must include the known yellow letters? Otherwise, we won\'t see if they appear? Actually, we know R and A are present? So we must include them? Else we might miss information. Especially we have limited guesses? So we should always include known present letters? Yes.\n\n Therefore, PLANT has A? But doesn\'t have R? So it\'s invalid? We must include both R and A.\n\n So only words that contain R and A and exclude E,I,S.\n\n So between ADORN and BROAD? ADORN: A at pos1? If in secret word, is A at pos1? We don\'t know? We only know it\'s not at pos2? So same for any position? We don\'t know? So ADORN seems fine? But ADORN has A at pos1? So we do test A? And R at pos4? Now, let me see: to maximize information? We are covering positions for A and R? We also cover D,O,N in new positions? \n\n Now, BROAD: R at pos2 and A at pos4? So more focused on R and A? \n\n Actually, both are fine? I\'ll go with ADORN.\n\n But note: ADORN has A in one of the positions? We know A could be anywhere except position 2? Position 1 is possible? So why not test that? \n\n Also, ADORN gets more vowels? O? And we avoid duplication.\n\n So I decide to guess ""ADORN"".\n\n However, let me double-check: ADORN doesn\'t contain E,I,S? Correct? A,D,O,R,N -> none are E,I,S.\n\n It\'s a word? Yes, meaning to decorate.\n\n So <guess>ADORN</guess>\n\n Alternatively, if I choose BROAD: \n   If BROAD gets feedback:\n      If R is in position2, we get ✓ for R? But we don\'t know? \n      But ADORN does not put R in a position we already know is wrong? For R, we only know position1 is wrong? So in ADORN, R in position4? We haven\'t tested position4? So it\'s fine.\n\n I\'ll go with ADORN.Based on the feedback from Guess 1 (RAISE):  \n- R and A are in the secret word but not in positions 1 or 2, respectively.  \n- I, S, and E are not in the secret word.  \n\nFor the second guess, I need a word that:  \n1. Includes R and A (since they are confirmed present).  \n2. Excludes I, S, and E.  \n3. Avoids placing R in position 1 or A in position 2.  \n4. Uses distinct common letters to maximize new information.  \n\nI chose ""ADORN"" because it:  \n- Places A in position 1 (a new, untested position) and R in position 4 (avoiding the wrong position of 1).  \n- Adds new common letters: D, O, and N (O is a frequent vowel, D and N are common consonants).  \n- Avoids I, S, E and has no duplicate letters.  \n\nThis guess tests new positions for A and R while introducing three additional letters, providing a balanced setup for feedback.\n\n<guess>ADORN</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ADORN -> FEEDBACK: A(-) D(x) O(x) R(-) N(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

**Guess 1: RAISE**
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 1.
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 2.
- I(x): I is not in the word.
- S(x): S is not in the word.
- E(x): E is not in the word.

**Guess 2: ADORN**
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- D(x): D is not in the word.
- O(x): O is not in the word.
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 4.
- N(x): N is not in the word.

**Summary of known information:**
- Present letters (must be included): R and A
- Absent letters: I, S, E, D, O, N
- Incorrect positions:
  - R cannot be in position 1 (from Guess 1) or position 4 (from Guess 2)
  - A cannot be in position 2 (from Guess 1) or position 1 (from Guess 2)

Since R is not in positions 1 or 4, and A is not in positions 1 or 2, we can deduce possible positions:
- R must be in position 2, 3, or 5.
- A must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

We also know the secret word contains exactly R and A as known letters so far? But note: there may be additional letters not yet tested. Also, from the absent list, we exclude I, S, E, D, O, N. So the remaining letters must come from other alphabets.

Let me list letters not used or tested: 
All consonants and vowels except those excluded: 
Excluded: I, S, E, D, O, N (6 letters)
Alphabet has 26, so 20 left? But we've tested: R, A in both; and others: I,S,E,D,O,N.

So untested letters: B,C,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Among these, common letters: T, L, U, C, M, P, H, etc.

We must include both R and A in the next guess, and they must be placed in positions that are currently allowed:

Possible positions for R: 2,3,5  
Possible positions for A: 3,4,5  

The word must fit these constraints and be a valid English word.

Additionally, the new guess should test new letters to gather more information? We have limited guesses left (4 remaining), and we need to find the secret word quickly.

Therefore, we should prioritize words that test multiple common letters while respecting the position constraints.

Consider possible placements:  
- Since A can be in 3,4,5 and R in 2,3,5, we can try to assign them to positions that don't overlap unless required? But overlap might be possible? For example, position 3 could be A or R, but not both? Actually, one letter per position? So we need to decide.

Scenario 1: R in position 2? Then positions for A: 3,4,5  
Scenario 2: R in position 3? Then positions for A: 4,5 (since position 3 is taken? But if R is in pos3, A cannot be at pos3? So only pos4 or5)  
Similarly, R in position 5? Then A in position 3 or4?  

But also, we can have a word where R and A are not at these positions? But we must include both.

Now, given that, let's brainstorm words.

First, let's consider words with R in position 2, since that's the only scenario where R can be in an earlier position.

If R in position 2:  
Then A in position 3,4, or5.

Possible words:  
- Position 1: ? (a new letter)  
- Position 2: R  
- Position 3: A? Or if A elsewhere  
- Position 4: ?  
- Position 5: ?

But we need valid English words.

For example, if R in pos2 and A in pos3: Then we have _ R A ? ?  
Possible: CRAFT? But C-R-A-F-T? But F,T? However, N is out? But CRAFT has A in pos3? And unknown pos4,5? But C,R,A,F,T? Are there other words? TRAWL? But T-R-A-W-L: L? But note TRAWL has A in pos3.

But TRAWL letters: T,R,A,W,L.  
Now, W and L? Also, we haven't tested W and L? And exclude E,I,S,N,O,D? So W and L are allowed? Yes.

But TRAWL: T(not excluded), R, A, W, L.  
Positions:  
1: T?  
2: R? This is allowed?  
3: A? Position 3? But we know A is not in position 2? Position 3 is new?  
However, we also know from ADORN that A is not in position 1? And here position 1 is T? So it's fine?  
But in TRAWL, A is in position 3? So is that possible? Yes.

Similarly, positions:  
R is in position 2? Which we haven't tested?  
A in position 3? Also new?  
We test T, W, L.

Now, alternative: R in position 2 and A in position 4? Then _ R ? A ?  
Example: TRACT? But C and T? But T in both ends? Not distinct? And ""TRACT"" has T repeated? But the secret word might have repeats? We don't know? But for guess, it's okay to repeat? However, since in previous we had distinct? We can do? But to maximize information, it's better to avoid repeats?  

Other word: WRAPT? Not common, but WRAPPED? No, five letters?  
Perhaps WRACK? W-R-A-C-K: Then A is in position 3? Not position 4?  

If A in position 4: _ R ? A ?  
Example: FRUIT? But U? And I is excluded? I cannot be used?  
PLAIT? I excluded? Disallowed.  
GRAVY? G-R-A-V-Y: A in position 3? Again position 3?  

So what about A in position 4? For example, CRAWL: C-R-A-W-L? A in position 3? Still.  
TRAMP: T-R-A-M-P? A in 3? Not 4.  

Perhaps ""PROAL"" not a word?  
""CRWTH""? Not common?  

Another: ""DRABS""? D is excluded? Cannot.  
So, R in position 2 and A in position 4?  
Try ""TROAD""? Not a word?  
""BRAXY""? Not common?  

Actually, common words: How about ""GRACY""? Not a word?  

Perhaps not many? Words like ""CRACK"" but repeats C?  

So maybe for A in position 4: ""WRAPT"" is archaic? Not ideal?  

Alternatively, R in position 3?  
Then positions:  
? ? R ? ?  

R in position 3: must have R there?  
Then A in position 4 or 5?  
Because positions 1,2,3: but position 3 is R? So A must be in 4 or 5?  

For example, with A in position 4: ? ? R A ?  
Possible: FARCE? E excluded.  
BARES? E excluded.  
CARES? E excluded.  
PARTY? P-A-R-T-Y? But A in position 2? Which we know is invalid? Also, P-A? A at position 2? Disallowed.  
GARDE? Not English?  
So ""MARKS""? M-A-R-K-S? But A in position 2? Disallowed? Because A cannot be in position 2? So if I have _ _ R _ _, and I want A in position 4, the word must avoid A in position 2?  

For positions:  
Positions:  
1: ?  
2: ? but not A?  
3: R (fixed)  
4: A  
5: ?  

So for example, UPPER? No.  
Possible words: PURR? Too short?  
What about: BLARE? B-L-A-R-E? E excluded? Also L?  
BLARE? E excluded?  
So with constraints: position 2 cannot be A, position 4 must be A?  
Example: FURCA? Not a word?  
TURMA? Not word?  
""EARTH""? But E excluded?  

Perhaps ""CAROL""? C-A-R-O-L? But O excluded? And A is in position 2? Disallowed? Because A cannot be in position 2?  

Similarly, ""PARAM""? P-A-R-A-M? A in 2? Disallowed?  

Alternative: R in position 3 and A in position 5? Then _ _ R ? A  

Possible words: OPERA? O excluded? E excluded?  
LARVA? L-A-R-V-A? But A in position 2? Disallowed? V? And repeats A?  
BARRA? Not word?  
""WORRY""? O excluded?  
""FERRY""? E excluded?  

""MARAH""? M-A-R-A-H? A in position 2? Disallowed?  

Having trouble?  

Now, try R in position 5? Then we have _ _ _ _ R  
And A must be in position 3 or 4?  
For example, with A in position 3: _ _ A _ R  
Or A in position 4: _ _ _ A R  

Then possible words:  
With A in position 3: Let's say position 1:?, position 2:?, position 3:A, position 4:?, position 5:R?  
Example: C_R? TALAR? But T,A,L,A,R? Not?  
PALAR? P-A-L-A-R? Disallowed because A in position 2? Positions: 1:P, position2:? Must not be A? So position2: L? Then position3: A? So ""PLAAR""? Not word.  
""ULCAR""? U-L-C-A-R? Letters: U,L,C,A,R?  
Position 1: U, 2: L, 3: C, 4: A, 5: R? A in position 4? Allowed?  
Is ULCAR a word? I don't think so. ""ULC"" not common.  

Other: ""VAGAR""? V-A-G-A-R? A in position2? Disallowed?  
""RAKAM""? Not?  
Perhaps common: ""SUGAR""? S excluded? Cannot.  
""VAPOR""? O excluded?  

Another: ""METAL""? E excluded?  
""ULTRA""? U-L-T-R-A?  
But positions: position1:U,2:L,3:T,4:R,5:A?  
So:  
Position3: T? position4: R? position5: A? There?  
But R is in position4? Wait, R cannot be in position4? We know from ADORN feedback that R is not in position4? R(-) in position4? In ADORN, position4 was R and it was marked as '-', meaning present but wrong position? So we cannot put R in position4 again? Or can we? Logically, it won't be correct, so we should avoid position4 for R? But in the rules, we are allowed to guess, but it would be inefficient? Because we already know position4 is wrong?  

So R in position4 should be avoided? Similarly, we avoid positions already tried and marked as wrong?  

Therefore, R in position4 is known wrong? So we cannot use R in position4?  

Similarly, we already know:

For R: wrong positions: 1 and 4  
For A: wrong positions: 1 and 2  

Therefore, valid positions:  
R: 2,3,5  
A: 3,4,5  

But we cannot have R at position4? So it's eliminated?  

Now, back to R in position5? And A in position3 or4?

With A in position3: ? ? A ? R  
Or A in position4: ? ? ? A R  

Then:

If A in position3: _ _ A _ R  
Position1: ?, position2: ? (but not A? Because A in3), position3:A, position4:?, position5:R  

And word must not use absent letters?  

Possible: LATCH? But E? CH for letters? C,H? Let's find English words?  

""PATHY""? Not?  
"" MAGAR""? M-A-G-A-R? A in position2? Disallowed?  
""BAGAR""? Same?  

Alternative: ""VALID""? But V,A,L,I,D? I excluded?  

""FATAL""? F-A-T-A-L? A in position2? Disallowed?  

Hard.

With A in position4: _ _ _ A R  
Example: ""ULTRA"": U-L-T-R-A? But positions: 1:U,2:L,3:T,4:R,5:A  
But R is in position4? Which we know is wrong? So if the secret word has R not in position4, we'll get '-'? But we already know that from ADORN? And we shouldn't repeat?  
So to save a guess, avoid R in position4?  

Other words: ""EXTRA""? E and X? E excluded?  
""GATHA""? Not?  
""MITRA""? I excluded?  

Perhaps ""MATCH""? Doesn't work?  

Another idea: R in position3 and A in position4 or5?  
We try that?  

For example, R in position3 and A in position4: ? ? R A ?  
Possible: BAR_? But B-A-R? A in position2? Disallowed?  
CAR_? C-A-R? A in position2? Disallowed?  

But position1 and position2 should not have A?  
So for ? ? R A ?:  
Position1: not A  
Position2: not A  
Position3: R  
Position4: A  
Position5: ?

So e.g., TURFA? U, F? Not common?  
PUREA? P-U-R-E-A? E excluded?  

""LARVA"": L-A-R-V-A? A in position2? Disallowed?  

""FORAM""? O excluded?  

""MERCH""? E excluded?  

Possible: ""CURAT""? C-U-R-A-T? U? T?  
Letters: C,U,R,A,T?  
Are C,U,T allowed? Yes?  
Positions:  
1: C  
2: U  
3: R  
4: A  
5: T

CURAT is a word? Checking: CURAT is not common? CURATE? Six letters.  

""BURKA""? B-U-R-K-A? A in position5?  
Positions: 1:B,2:U,3:R,4:K,5:A  
Then A is in position5? This is for R in position3 and A in position5.  

BURKA is a word? Yes, a type of garment.

So BURKA: B,U,R,K,A

But what about position2? It's U? We haven't tested U? 

Also, we must avoid O,E,I,S,N,D? U is not excluded? So BURKA is possible? 

But let's confirm: R in position3?  
A in position5?  
Position2: U? Also, B and K new? 

Now, valid? 

Similarly, ""HURRA"" not a word?  
""JUROR"" O excluded?  

Another: ""PURRA"" not word?  

Since R in position3 is fixed, and A in position5? Then other positions: any of the letters not excluded? 

Perhaps ""CURTA"" not word?  

Back to R in position2? Which seems easier? 

If R in position2 and A in position5: ? R ? A ?  
Then positions 1,3,4 need to be filled with letters not excluded?  

For example: CRAFT? C-R-A-F-T? But A here is in position3?  
If A in position5: then ? R ? ? A?  
Example: TRUFA? Not word?  
BRUSH? U,S excluded?  
FRUIT? I excluded?  
CRAWL? C-R-A-W-L? A in position3? For A in position5: ? R ? ? A  
Like ""BARRA"" not?  
""FERRA"" E excluded?  

""WORMA"" O and A? But A at position5?  

Actually, ""GRAMA"" G-R-A-M-A? Repeats A?  
Letters: G,R,A,M,A?  
But position3: A? Then position5:A?  
But the secret word might have double A? But we can't assume?  

Given the difficulty, let's list words that include R and A, exclude E,I,S,D,O,N, and have positions where R is not in 1 or 4, A not in 1 or 2? And letters from B,C,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? And valid English.

Possible word: ""TRAMP""
- T-R-A-M-P
- Positions: R in position2 (allowed)
- A in position3 ( allowed? Yes? Because not position2)
- But does it violate? R in position2: allowed A in position3: allowed
- Also, no excluded letters? T, M, P: not in absent list.

""TRAMP"": T,R,A,M,P
Feedback: T,R,A,M,P? Exclude E,I,S,D,O,N? Yes.

But is TRAMP a word? Yes.

Another: ""TRAWL"" T,R,A,W,L
- R in position2, A in position3? But position3 for A? Is this allowed? Yes, A is not forbidden in position3? Only positions 1 and 2 are forbidden? So in TRAMP and TRAWL, A is in position3? That's fine.

We can also try ""GRAPH""? G-R-A-P-H? A in position3? Yes.
But G,R,A,P,H? H? P? G? All allowed.

But TRAWL has W and L? Which are common? TRAMP has M and P? 

Perhaps TRAMP is better? Or whatever.

But also, we must include R and A? Both have them.

Now, comparing to ADORN and RAISE, TRAWL or TRAMP?

In TRAWL: positions 1:T, 2:R, 3:A, 4:W,5:L? 
R in position2: we haven't tested position2? So this will tell us if position2 is correct? If it is, we get R(✓)? If not, R(-)? 
Similarly, A in position3: new position? 
And T,W,L tested.

Similarly for TRAMP.

But note in TRAMP: position4 is M and position5 is P? 
Both have T in position1? 

Given that, I think TRAWL is a valid choice? Or TRAMP?

Another: ""CRAWL"" C-R-A-W-L? Position1:C, not tested? Better than T? But T is common? 

In the first guess RAISE, T wasn't used? So introducing T is good.

So TRAMP: T,R,A,M,P

or TRAWL: T,R,A,W,L

Both good? 

I'll pick ""TRAMP"" because it tests M and P, which are common.

But to maximize, perhaps TRAMP? 

But let me see if there's a word with R in position3 or5? 

With R in position3 and A in position4: We had trouble? But BURKA with A in position5? 
BURKA: B,U,R,K,A 
- Positions: 1:B,2:U,3:R,4:K,5:A? 
This places R in position3 (new) and A in position5 (new) 
And tests B,U,K. 

U is vowel? And B,K are not as common? But BURKA is a valid word? 

Compared to TRAMP: T common, R in2, A in3? 

Perhaps TRAMP is more standard? 

Given the time, I'll go with TRAMP.

But in TRAMP, is position for A: position3? We know from previous that A is in the word, not in pos2? So pos3 is untested?  

The secret word could have A in pos3? Or not? 

So I guess ""TRAMP"" . 

<guess>TRAMP</guess>
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

Based on the feedback:
- **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: R and A are in the word but not in positions 1 or 2. I, S, and E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (ADORN)**: A and R are in the word but not in positions 1 or 4. D, O, and N are absent.
  
**Key insights**:
- **Confirmed letters**: R and A must appear in the new guess.
- **Absent letters**: I, S, E, D, O, N cannot be used.
- **Position constraints**:
  - R cannot be in positions 1 or 4 (from Guess 1 and Guess 2).
  - A cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (from Guess 1 and Guess 2).
- **Possible positions**:
  - R: Positions 2, 3, or 5.
- A: Positions 3, 4, or 5.
- **Available letters**: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (since E, I, S, D, O, N are excluded).

**Strategy**:  
- Prioritize words with R and A in allowed positions while introducing new common letters (e.g., T, L, M, P) to maximize information.
- R in position 2 and A in position 3 are plausible focus areas, as these positions are untested and common in English words.
- Avoid repeating letters for efficiency.

**Selected word: ""TRAMP""**  
- **Structure**: T-R-A-M-P
  - Position 1: T (new letter, untested)
  - Position 2: R (allowed; not position 1 or 4)
  - Position 3: A (allowed; not position 1 or 2)
  - Position 4: M (new letter)
  - Position 5: P (new letter)
- **Why TRAMP?**:
  - Tests R and A in new positions (R in pos 2, A in pos 3).
  - Introduces T, M, P—high-frequency consonants.
  - Avoids constraints and absent letters.
  - Balanced mix of common letters; valid 5-letter word with no duplicates.

This guess will clarify:
- If R is in position 2 (✓ or -).
- If A is in position 3 (✓ or -).
- Presence/absence of T, M, P.

<guess>TRAMP</guess>",TRAMP,"We have feedback from two guesses:

**Guess 1: RAISE**
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 1.
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 2.
- I(x): I is not in the word.
- S(x): S is not in the word.
- E(x): E is not in the word.

**Guess 2: ADORN**
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- D(x): D is not in the word.
- O(x): O is not in the word.
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 4.
- N(x): N is not in the word.

**Summary of known information:**
- Present letters (must be included): R and A
- Absent letters: I, S, E, D, O, N
- Incorrect positions:
  - R cannot be in position 1 (from Guess 1) or position 4 (from Guess 2)
  - A cannot be in position 2 (from Guess 1) or position 1 (from Guess 2)

Since R is not in positions 1 or 4, and A is not in positions 1 or 2, we can deduce possible positions:
- R must be in position 2, 3, or 5.
- A must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

We also know the secret word contains exactly R and A as known letters so far? But note: there may be additional letters not yet tested. Also, from the absent list, we exclude I, S, E, D, O, N. So the remaining letters must come from other alphabets.

Let me list letters not used or tested: 
All consonants and vowels except those excluded: 
Excluded: I, S, E, D, O, N (6 letters)
Alphabet has 26, so 20 left? But we've tested: R, A in both; and others: I,S,E,D,O,N.

So untested letters: B,C,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Among these, common letters: T, L, U, C, M, P, H, etc.

We must include both R and A in the next guess, and they must be placed in positions that are currently allowed:

Possible positions for R: 2,3,5  
Possible positions for A: 3,4,5  

The word must fit these constraints and be a valid English word.

Additionally, the new guess should test new letters to gather more information? We have limited guesses left (4 remaining), and we need to find the secret word quickly.

Therefore, we should prioritize words that test multiple common letters while respecting the position constraints.

Consider possible placements:  
- Since A can be in 3,4,5 and R in 2,3,5, we can try to assign them to positions that don't overlap unless required? But overlap might be possible? For example, position 3 could be A or R, but not both? Actually, one letter per position? So we need to decide.

Scenario 1: R in position 2? Then positions for A: 3,4,5  
Scenario 2: R in position 3? Then positions for A: 4,5 (since position 3 is taken? But if R is in pos3, A cannot be at pos3? So only pos4 or5)  
Similarly, R in position 5? Then A in position 3 or4?  

But also, we can have a word where R and A are not at these positions? But we must include both.

Now, given that, let's brainstorm words.

First, let's consider words with R in position 2, since that's the only scenario where R can be in an earlier position.

If R in position 2:  
Then A in position 3,4, or5.

Possible words:  
- Position 1: ? (a new letter)  
- Position 2: R  
- Position 3: A? Or if A elsewhere  
- Position 4: ?  
- Position 5: ?

But we need valid English words.

For example, if R in pos2 and A in pos3: Then we have _ R A ? ?  
Possible: CRAFT? But C-R-A-F-T? But F,T? However, N is out? But CRAFT has A in pos3? And unknown pos4,5? But C,R,A,F,T? Are there other words? TRAWL? But T-R-A-W-L: L? But note TRAWL has A in pos3.

But TRAWL letters: T,R,A,W,L.  
Now, W and L? Also, we haven't tested W and L? And exclude E,I,S,N,O,D? So W and L are allowed? Yes.

But TRAWL: T(not excluded), R, A, W, L.  
Positions:  
1: T?  
2: R? This is allowed?  
3: A? Position 3? But we know A is not in position 2? Position 3 is new?  
However, we also know from ADORN that A is not in position 1? And here position 1 is T? So it's fine?  
But in TRAWL, A is in position 3? So is that possible? Yes.

Similarly, positions:  
R is in position 2? Which we haven't tested?  
A in position 3? Also new?  
We test T, W, L.

Now, alternative: R in position 2 and A in position 4? Then _ R ? A ?  
Example: TRACT? But C and T? But T in both ends? Not distinct? And ""TRACT"" has T repeated? But the secret word might have repeats? We don't know? But for guess, it's okay to repeat? However, since in previous we had distinct? We can do? But to maximize information, it's better to avoid repeats?  

Other word: WRAPT? Not common, but WRAPPED? No, five letters?  
Perhaps WRACK? W-R-A-C-K: Then A is in position 3? Not position 4?  

If A in position 4: _ R ? A ?  
Example: FRUIT? But U? And I is excluded? I cannot be used?  
PLAIT? I excluded? Disallowed.  
GRAVY? G-R-A-V-Y: A in position 3? Again position 3?  

So what about A in position 4? For example, CRAWL: C-R-A-W-L? A in position 3? Still.  
TRAMP: T-R-A-M-P? A in 3? Not 4.  

Perhaps ""PROAL"" not a word?  
""CRWTH""? Not common?  

Another: ""DRABS""? D is excluded? Cannot.  
So, R in position 2 and A in position 4?  
Try ""TROAD""? Not a word?  
""BRAXY""? Not common?  

Actually, common words: How about ""GRACY""? Not a word?  

Perhaps not many? Words like ""CRACK"" but repeats C?  

So maybe for A in position 4: ""WRAPT"" is archaic? Not ideal?  

Alternatively, R in position 3?  
Then positions:  
? ? R ? ?  

R in position 3: must have R there?  
Then A in position 4 or 5?  
Because positions 1,2,3: but position 3 is R? So A must be in 4 or 5?  

For example, with A in position 4: ? ? R A ?  
Possible: FARCE? E excluded.  
BARES? E excluded.  
CARES? E excluded.  
PARTY? P-A-R-T-Y? But A in position 2? Which we know is invalid? Also, P-A? A at position 2? Disallowed.  
GARDE? Not English?  
So ""MARKS""? M-A-R-K-S? But A in position 2? Disallowed? Because A cannot be in position 2? So if I have _ _ R _ _, and I want A in position 4, the word must avoid A in position 2?  

For positions:  
Positions:  
1: ?  
2: ? but not A?  
3: R (fixed)  
4: A  
5: ?  

So for example, UPPER? No.  
Possible words: PURR? Too short?  
What about: BLARE? B-L-A-R-E? E excluded? Also L?  
BLARE? E excluded?  
So with constraints: position 2 cannot be A, position 4 must be A?  
Example: FURCA? Not a word?  
TURMA? Not word?  
""EARTH""? But E excluded?  

Perhaps ""CAROL""? C-A-R-O-L? But O excluded? And A is in position 2? Disallowed? Because A cannot be in position 2?  

Similarly, ""PARAM""? P-A-R-A-M? A in 2? Disallowed?  

Alternative: R in position 3 and A in position 5? Then _ _ R ? A  

Possible words: OPERA? O excluded? E excluded?  
LARVA? L-A-R-V-A? But A in position 2? Disallowed? V? And repeats A?  
BARRA? Not word?  
""WORRY""? O excluded?  
""FERRY""? E excluded?  

""MARAH""? M-A-R-A-H? A in position 2? Disallowed?  

Having trouble?  

Now, try R in position 5? Then we have _ _ _ _ R  
And A must be in position 3 or 4?  
For example, with A in position 3: _ _ A _ R  
Or A in position 4: _ _ _ A R  

Then possible words:  
With A in position 3: Let's say position 1:?, position 2:?, position 3:A, position 4:?, position 5:R?  
Example: C_R? TALAR? But T,A,L,A,R? Not?  
PALAR? P-A-L-A-R? Disallowed because A in position 2? Positions: 1:P, position2:? Must not be A? So position2: L? Then position3: A? So ""PLAAR""? Not word.  
""ULCAR""? U-L-C-A-R? Letters: U,L,C,A,R?  
Position 1: U, 2: L, 3: C, 4: A, 5: R? A in position 4? Allowed?  
Is ULCAR a word? I don't think so. ""ULC"" not common.  

Other: ""VAGAR""? V-A-G-A-R? A in position2? Disallowed?  
""RAKAM""? Not?  
Perhaps common: ""SUGAR""? S excluded? Cannot.  
""VAPOR""? O excluded?  

Another: ""METAL""? E excluded?  
""ULTRA""? U-L-T-R-A?  
But positions: position1:U,2:L,3:T,4:R,5:A?  
So:  
Position3: T? position4: R? position5: A? There?  
But R is in position4? Wait, R cannot be in position4? We know from ADORN feedback that R is not in position4? R(-) in position4? In ADORN, position4 was R and it was marked as '-', meaning present but wrong position? So we cannot put R in position4 again? Or can we? Logically, it won't be correct, so we should avoid position4 for R? But in the rules, we are allowed to guess, but it would be inefficient? Because we already know position4 is wrong?  

So R in position4 should be avoided? Similarly, we avoid positions already tried and marked as wrong?  

Therefore, R in position4 is known wrong? So we cannot use R in position4?  

Similarly, we already know:

For R: wrong positions: 1 and 4  
For A: wrong positions: 1 and 2  

Therefore, valid positions:  
R: 2,3,5  
A: 3,4,5  

But we cannot have R at position4? So it's eliminated?  

Now, back to R in position5? And A in position3 or4?

With A in position3: ? ? A ? R  
Or A in position4: ? ? ? A R  

Then:

If A in position3: _ _ A _ R  
Position1: ?, position2: ? (but not A? Because A in3), position3:A, position4:?, position5:R  

And word must not use absent letters?  

Possible: LATCH? But E? CH for letters? C,H? Let's find English words?  

""PATHY""? Not?  
"" MAGAR""? M-A-G-A-R? A in position2? Disallowed?  
""BAGAR""? Same?  

Alternative: ""VALID""? But V,A,L,I,D? I excluded?  

""FATAL""? F-A-T-A-L? A in position2? Disallowed?  

Hard.

With A in position4: _ _ _ A R  
Example: ""ULTRA"": U-L-T-R-A? But positions: 1:U,2:L,3:T,4:R,5:A  
But R is in position4? Which we know is wrong? So if the secret word has R not in position4, we'll get '-'? But we already know that from ADORN? And we shouldn't repeat?  
So to save a guess, avoid R in position4?  

Other words: ""EXTRA""? E and X? E excluded?  
""GATHA""? Not?  
""MITRA""? I excluded?  

Perhaps ""MATCH""? Doesn't work?  

Another idea: R in position3 and A in position4 or5?  
We try that?  

For example, R in position3 and A in position4: ? ? R A ?  
Possible: BAR_? But B-A-R? A in position2? Disallowed?  
CAR_? C-A-R? A in position2? Disallowed?  

But position1 and position2 should not have A?  
So for ? ? R A ?:  
Position1: not A  
Position2: not A  
Position3: R  
Position4: A  
Position5: ?

So e.g., TURFA? U, F? Not common?  
PUREA? P-U-R-E-A? E excluded?  

""LARVA"": L-A-R-V-A? A in position2? Disallowed?  

""FORAM""? O excluded?  

""MERCH""? E excluded?  

Possible: ""CURAT""? C-U-R-A-T? U? T?  
Letters: C,U,R,A,T?  
Are C,U,T allowed? Yes?  
Positions:  
1: C  
2: U  
3: R  
4: A  
5: T

CURAT is a word? Checking: CURAT is not common? CURATE? Six letters.  

""BURKA""? B-U-R-K-A? A in position5?  
Positions: 1:B,2:U,3:R,4:K,5:A  
Then A is in position5? This is for R in position3 and A in position5.  

BURKA is a word? Yes, a type of garment.

So BURKA: B,U,R,K,A

But what about position2? It's U? We haven't tested U? 

Also, we must avoid O,E,I,S,N,D? U is not excluded? So BURKA is possible? 

But let's confirm: R in position3?

Now, valid?

Perhaps ""CURTA"" not word?  

Back to R in position2? Which seems easier? 

If R in position2 and A in position5: ? R ? A ?  
Then positions 1,3,4 need to be filled with letters not excluded?  

For example: CRAFT? C-R-A-F-T? But A here is in position3?  
If A in position5: then ? R ? ? A?  
Example: TRUFA? Not word?  
BRUSH? U,S excluded?  
FRUIT? I excluded?  
CRAWL? C-R-A-W-L? A in position3? For A in position5: ? R ? ? A  
Like ""BARRA"" not?  
""FERRA"" E excluded?  

""WORMA"" O and A? But A at position5?  

Actually, ""GRAMA"" G-R-A-M-A? Repeats A?  
Letters: G,R,A,M,A?  
But position3: A? Then position5:A?  
But the secret word might have double A? But we can't assume?  

Given the difficulty, let's list words that include R and A, exclude E,I,S,D,O,N, and have positions where R is not in 1 or 4, A not in 1 or 2? And letters from B,C,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? And valid English.

Possible word: ""TRAMP""
- T-R-A-M-P
- Positions: R in position2 (allowed)
- A in position3 ( allowed? Yes? Because not position2)
- But does it violate? R in position2: allowed A in position3: allowed
- Also, no excluded letters? T, M, P: not in absent list.

""TRAMP"": T,R,A,M,P
Feedback: T,R,A,M,P? Exclude E,I,S,D,O,N? Yes.

But is TRAMP a word? Yes.

Another: ""TRAWL"" T,R,A,W,L
- R in position2, A in position3? But position3 for A? Is this allowed? Yes, A is not forbidden in position3? Only positions 1 and 2 are forbidden? So in TRAMP and TRAWL, A is in position3? That's fine.

We can also try ""GRAPH""? G-R-A-P-H? A in position3? Yes.
But G,R,A,P,H? H? P? G? All allowed.

But TRAWL has W and L? Which are common? TRAMP has M and P? 

Perhaps TRAMP is better? Or whatever.

But also, we must include R and A? Both have them.

Now, comparing to ADORN and RAISE, TRAWL or TRAMP?

In TRAWL: positions 1:T, 2:R, 3:A, 4:W,5:L? 
R in position2: we haven't tested position2? So this will tell us if position2 is correct? If it is, we get R(✓)? If not, R(-)? 
Similarly, A in position3: new position? 
And T,W,L tested.

Similarly for TRAMP.

But note in TRAMP: position4 is M and position5 is P? 
Both have T in position1? 

Given that, I think TRAWL is a valid choice? Or TRAMP?

Another: ""CRAWL"" C-R-A-W-L? Position1:C, not tested? Better than T? But T is common? 

In the first guess RAISE, T wasn't used? So introducing T is good.

So TRAMP: T,R,A,M,P

or TRAWL: T,R,A,W,L

Both good? 

I'll pick ""TRAMP"" because it tests M and P, which are common.

But to maximize, perhaps TRAMP? 

But let me see if there's a word with R in position3 or5? 

With R in position3 and A in position4: We had trouble? But BURKA with A in position5? 
BURKA: B,U,R,K,A 
- Positions: 1:B,2:U,3:R,4:K,5:A? 
This places R in position3 (new) and A in position5 (new) 
And tests B,U,K. 

U is vowel? And B,K are not as common? But BURKA is a valid word? 

Compared to TRAMP: T common, R in2, A in3? 

Perhaps TRAMP is more standard? 

Given the time, I'll go with TRAMP.

But in TRAMP, is position for A: position3? We know from previous that A is in the word, not in pos2? So pos3 is untested?  

The secret word could have A in pos3? Or not? 

So I guess ""TRAMP"" . 

<guess>TRAMP</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

Based on the feedback:
- **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: R and A are in the word but not in positions 1 or 2. I, S, and E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (ADORN)**: A and R are in the word but not in positions 1 or 4. D, O, and N are absent.
  
**Key insights**:
- **Confirmed letters**: R and A must appear in the new guess.
- **Absent letters**: I, S, E, D, O, N cannot be used.
- **Position constraints**:
  - R cannot be in positions 1 or 4 (from Guess 1 and Guess 2).
  - A cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (from Guess 1 and Guess 2).
- **Possible positions**:
  - R: Positions 2, 3, or 5.
- A: Positions 3, 4, or 5.
- **Available letters**: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (since E, I, S, D, O, N are excluded).

**Strategy**:  
- Prioritize words with R and A in allowed positions while introducing new common letters (e.g., T, L, M, P) to maximize information.
- R in position 2 and A in position 3 are plausible focus areas, as these positions are untested and common in English words.
- Avoid repeating letters for efficiency.

**Selected word: ""TRAMP""**  
- **Structure**: T-R-A-M-P
  - Position 1: T (new letter, untested)
  - Position 2: R (allowed; not position 1 or 4)
  - Position 3: A (allowed; not position 1 or 2)
  - Position 4: M (new letter)
  - Position 5: P (new letter)
- **Why TRAMP?**:
  - Tests R and A in new positions (R in pos 2, A in pos 3).
  - Introduces T, M, P—high-frequency consonants.
  - Avoids constraints and absent letters.
  - Balanced mix of common letters; valid 5-letter word with no duplicates.

This guess will clarify:
- If R is in position 2 (✓ or -).
- If A is in position 3 (✓ or -).
- Presence/absence of T, M, P.",Guess 3: TRAMP -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) A(-) M(-) P(x),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>First, I'm starting the game and need to make my first guess. Since it's the first guess, I have no prior feedback, so I should choose a word that maximizes the information I get.

A common strategy in Wordle is to start with words that have a good mix of common vowels and consonants. This helps in identifying which letters are present or absent.

I recall that words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ROAST"" are popular starters because they contain frequent letters. But I should pick one that covers different possibilities.

Let me think about letter frequency in English words. According to common knowledge, vowels like E, A, I, O, U are frequent, and consonants like R, S, T, L, N are also common.

To cover multiple common letters, words like ""ARISE"" or ""RAISE"" might be good. But I want to maximize coverage.

Perhaps ""CRATE"" – it has C, R, A, T, E. That's one vowel and four consonants.

Another one is ""SLICE"" with S, L, I, C, E.

I think ""CRANE"" is a solid first guess. Let me confirm: C, R, A, N, E. That includes three vowels? A and E are vowels, C is consonant, R consonant, N consonant. Actually, two vowels: A and E.

A and E are vowels, but I is also common. Maybe ""RAISE"" is better: R, A, I, S, E – that has three vowels: A, I, E.

Vowels: A, E, I, O, U. In ""RAISE"", A, I, E are vowels, so three vowels. In ""CRANE"", A and E are vowels, so two vowels. More vowels might be better for testing.

But consonants are important too. Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N.

So, a word like ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E – that's S, L, T consonants and A, E vowels.

""ROAST"" has R, O, A, S, T – R, S, T consonants and O, A vowels.

I should aim for a word with no repeating letters to maximize distinct letters.

Yes, all guesses should have unique letters to get more information.

So, for first guess, priority is: common letters, no repeats.

Let's list some top starters based on Wordle strategies:

- ""CRANE""

- ""SLATE""

- ""RAISE""

- ""ROATE"" (not a common word, but used)

""ADIEU"" has A, D, I, E, U – four vowels, but D might be less common.

I think ""SOARE"" is used, but not common.

I'll go with ""CRANE"" for my first guess. It has C, R, A, N, E – all common letters, and C and N might test less frequent ones.

But according to frequency, E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U are top.

E is most frequent.

So words with E, A, R, T, S are good.

""SALET"" or ""CRATE"".

I think ""CRANE"" is fine.

To be systematic, I'll choose ""RAISE"": R, A, I, S, E – includes R, A, I, S, E – all high frequency.

R, A, S are top consonants, E is top vowel, I is vowel.

Yes, ""RAISE"" seems excellent.

In the rules, I need to output in specific format.

So, for my first guess, I'll guess ""RAISE"".

But let me confirm it's a valid 5-letter word. ""Raise"" – yes, it's common.

Perhaps ""ARISE"" is similar.

I'll go with ""RAISE"".For the first guess in Wordle, I need to choose a word that maximizes the potential for useful feedback. Since there's no prior information, I should select a word with common letters to increase the chances of identifying correct letters or positions. Common starting words often include a mix of frequent vowels and consonants, with all letters distinct to cover more possibilities.

Key considerations:
- Letter frequency in English: E, A, R, I, S are among the most common (based on corpus data).
- Including multiple vowels can help test for essential word structure.
- Words like ""RAISE"", ""CRANE"", or ""SLATE"" are popular starters for this reason.

After evaluating options:
- ""RAISE"" contains R, A, I, S, E – all high-frequency letters.
- It has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).
- No repeated letters, so each position provides unique information.
- It's a valid 5-letter English word.

This guess should provide good feedback on whether any of these letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for Guess 1: RAISE -> R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
 This means:
   R is in the word but in the wrong position.
   A is in the word but in the wrong position.
   I is not in the word.
   S is not in the word.
   E is not in the word.

 So, from this:
   - The secret word contains R and A, but not in the first and second positions respectively.
   - The word does not contain I, S, E.

 Since R is in the word but not position 1, it must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. However, note that in the feedback, R was in position 1 but marked wrong, so it can't be position 1. Similarly, A was in position 2 and marked wrong so it can't be in position 2.

 Also, the word does not have I, S, E.

 We must guess a new 5-letter word that must include R and A (since they are in the word), and exclude I, S, E.

 Moreover, we know R cannot be in position 1 and A cannot be in position 2.

 Let's think about possible placements for R and A.

 We need to choose a word that has R in a position other than 1, and A in a position other than 2.

 Since we have only one previous guess, we don't know much about the exact positions, so we can try to cover other common letters and also test new positions for R and A.

 Let's consider what letters are available. We know E, I, S are out. So we avoid these.

 Common letters left: T, O, N, L, U, D, C, M, P, etc.

 Since the word has R and A, we can include these and add other frequent letters.

 We have 6 tries, so we can try to get more information.

 We might try a word that has R and A in different positions and introduces new common letters.

 But note: we must not put R in position 1 and A in position 2.

 Let me try to list possibilities for R: positions 2,3,4,5
 For A: positions 1,3,4,5 (because it can't be 2)

 However, if we put A in position 1, that would be a possibility we haven't tested.

 We can try to put R in position 4 or 5 and A in position 1 or 3 or 4 or 5 (but not 2).

 One idea: start with A in a new position, and R in a new position, and add T, O, N which are common.

 Consider ""TAROT"": but that has T and O? Also, TAROT has repeated T? Actually, it has T twice? Let's check: T-A-R-O-T -> repeated T. Also, we need to avoid S, I, E.

 Another word: ""RADAR"" has repeated A and R? Not good because repeated letters and we don't know if the secret word has repeats.

 Since we don't know if there are repeats, it's safer to try a word with distinct letters.

 So, what about ""PLANT""? But we have E, I, S out? But P,L,A,N,T. But A is included? Yes. But where do we put R? We haven't included R. Remember R is present so we must include R in the guess because we know it's in the word.

 Important: we must include the letters that the feedback told us are present: R and A.

 So, the next guess must contain R and A, and must not contain I, S, E.

 And distinct letters if possible.

 So, let's think:

 We need to place R and A in positions other than R in 1 and A in 2.

 We can have:

 Position 1: not R (but can be A or another letter)
 Position 2: not A (but can be R? Wait, feedback from RAISE: R was in position 1 and was shown to be present but wrong position. So if we put R in position 2, that's allowed because we haven't tested R in position 2 before. Similarly, A in position 1 is allowed.

 However, note that R being present implies it is in the word somewhere, but we don't know where. Similarly for A.

 So, for guess 2, we can have:

 Option: put A in position 1 and R in position 3? Or R in position 5? Etc.

 Now, for the remaining letters: we need three more letters that are not I,S,E and are not duplicated.

 Let's choose common consonants and vowels excluding E,I,S.

 We have vowels: O,U,A (A we already have) but we need consonants? Actually, since A is included, we can use consonants.

 Common letters left: T, O, L, N, U, D, C, M, P, etc.

 We can form words with A and R and three of these.

 Possible words:

 - ""CAROM"": C-A-R-O-M -> letters C,A,R,O,M -> must check if valid. Carom is a word? Yes, meaning to strike and rebound. But it has R in position 3? And A in position 2? Wait, position 2 is A? But in feedback, we were told A is in the word but not in position 2? However, for the new guess, we don't know if position 2 might be the correct place? Wait no: In the previous feedback, A was in the second position (in RAISE) and marked as wrong position? That means the secret word has A, but it is not in position 2. So putting A in position 2 in a new guess is disallowed because we know A is not in position 2? Or can we still put it? No, because the feedback rule: the symbol ('-') means that the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, but it doesn't prevent us from guessing it again in the same position. However, logically, if we know that position 2 is wrong for A, we should avoid putting A in position 2 to avoid wasting a guess. Similarly, for R we know position 1 is wrong.

 Therefore, in the new guess, we should avoid:
 - R in position 1
 - A in position 2

 So for ""CAROM"": if I write C-A-R-O-M, then A is in position 2? That would be bad because we know A cannot be in position 2. So we should avoid that.

 Similarly, if I have a word starting with R (position 1) we know it's wrong.

 So, let me brainstorm words without R in 1 and without A in 2.

 Possibilities:

 Position 1: Any letter except R? Or except I,S,E? Actually any letter except R? We can put R elsewhere.

 How about ""FARCE""? F-A-R-C-E -> but E is excluded. We can't use E.

 Or ""YARTH""? Not a word.

 Word: ""OCTAL"" but missing R? We need R because we have to include the known letters.

 How about ""PARTY"": 
   P-A-R-T-Y -> 
      Position: 1: P (new, not R)
      Position 2: A -> this is position 2? But we cannot put A in position 2 because we know from feedback that A is not in position 2? So even though we are including A (which we know is in the word) we must avoid position 2 for A.

 Therefore, PARTY is invalid because A is in position 2.

 Another word: ""TRAWL"": 
   T-R-A-W-L -> 
      Position 1: T (new)
      Position 2: R -> but is R allowed in position 2? Let's see: in the feedback for RAISE, R was in position 1 and marked as wrong position. We don't know about position 2. So yes, R can be in position 2.

   But position 3: A -> which is position 3? That's not position 2 so it's allowed.

 So ""TRAWL"": 
   T (not E,I,S), R (in position 2: but we don't know if this is the correct position for R), A (position 3: safe because not position 2), W (new), L (new).
   Also, doesn't include I,S,E.

 But are we using the known presence? Yes, R and A are in the word.

 However, let's check if TRAWL is a word? Yes: to fish with a trawl net.

 Now, the problem: we are testing R in position 2 and A in position 3. But in the secret word, R and A might be in other positions. But that's okay because we might get feedback that they are not in these positions.

 Alternatively, we can avoid putting R and A in positions we suspect might be wrong? But we have no information except they are not in position 1 (R) and position 2 (A).

 An alternative: ""CARTY""? Not a word.

 ""DARAT""? Not a word.

 ""MAROON""? Too long.

 Another word: ""CRANK"": 
   C-R-A-N-K -> 
      Position 2: R? (allowed) 
      Position 3: A? (position 3 is not 2, so allowed) 
      But position 1: C? We haven't tested C. 
      But wait. In RAISE, we used R in pos1, A in pos2, etc. Now CRANK has R in pos2? Yes.

 But note: we know that E, I, S are out. N and K are new.

 CRANK is a word.

 However, we know that E, I, S are not in the word, but not that C is not? So including C is fine.

 But we are also missing R and A? We have R in position 2 and A in position 3.

 How about ""DRAWL"" but D-A? A in position 2? Avoid.

 Let me try to list:

 Without E,I,S and avoiding R in position 1 and A in position 2.

 How about:
   Position 1: T or L or O, etc.
   Position 2: R? (if we want to test R here) or other but not A? Actually we cannot put A in position 2, so we can put any other letter? But we want to get feedback on other positions.

 Another common word: ""ROAST"" but starts with R? That's position 1? We know R is not in position 1? So we must avoid putting R in position 1.

 Therefore, we cannot use ROAST.

 How about ""TAROT""? T-A-R-O-T -> A in position 2? Disallowed. And also repeated T? Not ideal.

 Perhaps ""BROAD"": 
   B-R-O-A-D -> 
        Position 2: R? Allowed.
        Position 4: A? Allowed (since not position 2).

 BROAD is a word? Yes.

 Also, BROAD: B, R, O, A, D -> new letters B, O, D, plus R and A.

 And avoids E,I,S.

 This seems better because we have R in position 2 and A in position 4? Positions: 
   1: B
   2: R
   3: O
   4: A
   5: D

 This puts R in a position we haven't tested (position 2) and A in position 4 (which we haven't tested). Also, we test O and D and B.

 But note: in RAISE, R was in position 1 and now we put R in position 2? We don't know if it might be correct? We don't have any information about position 2.

 Similarly, A was in position 2 in RAISE and now we put it in position 4.

 How about another word: ""CRAMP"": 
   C-R-A-M-P -> 
      R in pos2, A in pos3? Allowed? Yes.

 But CRAMP has M and P? Also good.

 CRAMP is a word.

 But BROAD might be better because it tests a vowel O? Or CRAMP tests consonants? 

 Since we don't know how many vowels are in the word? We know A is present and we avoided E,I (and O,U might be present).

 Given the feedback that RAISE had two yellows and three blacks, it's possible that the word has R, A, and three other letters.

 Let me think of the most frequent letters left: T, O, N, L, R, A are taken? R and A are in the word? So T, O, N, L are good choices to test.

 So perhaps BROAD (with O) or TRAIN? But TRAIN has A in position 3? Allowed, but I is not allowed? TRAIN has I? T-R-A-I-N -> I is excluded? So TRAIN is invalid.

 Similarly, ""TRAWL"" is valid? T-R-A-W-L -> has L? and W? 

 What about ""GRAND"": 
   G-R-A-N-D -> 
      R in pos2, A in pos3? Allowed? Yes. 
      Letters: G, R, A, N, D -> avoids E,I,S? Yes.

 GRAND is a word.

 I think any of BROAD, CRAMP, GRAND, TRAWL are possible.

 I'll pick BROAD because it uses common letters: B, R, O, A, D and covers O (a vowel) as well as D and B.

 Also, note that we might get feedback indicating if R is in position 2? and A in position 4? If one is at the right place, we'll get a ✓.

 Alternatively, if not, we'll get '-' or 'x' for R and A? But we know they are present? So at worst, we'll get '-' for R and A? Because they are in the word.

 But we are putting R in a new position (2) and A in a new position (4). So if the secret word has R in position 2, we get ✓? But if it has R in another position, we get '-' (because we put R in position 2 and then we know it's not at position 2? Actually, no: we know R is present? So if we put R in position 2 and it's not the right position, we'll get '-'. Similarly for A at position 4.

 Additionally, we test B, O, D.

 Considering that, BROAD seems fine.

 But let me also consider ""TARGO"" not a word.

 Another word: ""ROUND"": cannot because R in position 1? Disallowed? Because R in position 1 we know won't be correct? So avoid.

 How about ""ADORN"": 
   A-D-O-R-N -> 
        A in position 1? What do we know about A? We only know that A is not in position 2? Position 1 is allowed? Because nothing said position 1 cannot be A. 
        Then D, O, R in position 4, N.

 So ADORN: 
   Position 1: A (allowed? We haven't tested A in position 1? Only position 2? So yes, we can try A in position 1? But does the feedback say anything about position 1? In RAISE, the first position was R, and the second was A? So A wasn't in position 1? We don't know? Actually, we haven't tested A in position 1? So putting A in position 1 is possible? But wait: we know A is in the word? So if we put A in position 1 and it's correct, we'll get ✓? Or if it's not? Then we'll know.

 ADORN: A in pos1, D in pos2, O in pos3, R in pos4, N in pos5.

 This avoids position 2 for A? Yes, because here A is in position 1? And we know A is not in position 2? So position 1 is safe? Also, R is in position 4? Not position 1? So safe.

 So ADORN is also a candidate? ADORN: A, D, O, R, N -> letters new: D, O, N.

 Compared to BROAD: BROAD uses B, O, D? Same as?

 BROAD: B,R,O,A,D -> B and then O and D? Also N? No.

 ADORN has N? Which is common? Yes.

 Both avoid E,I,S.

 Which is better? ADORN has A in position 1 (which we haven't tried) and R in position 4 (new). Also, we test D, O, N.

 BROAD has R in position 2? And we haven't tried R in position 2? And A in position 4? And tests B.

 Personally, I think ADORN is better? Because it tests A in a new position (1) and R in position 4? And adds O, D, N? All common.

 BROAD: position 1: B? Not as common? But valid.

 Alternatively, let me consider ""PLANT"" again? But without R? Yes? We must include R? We cannot omit R? We must include the known yellow letters? Otherwise, we won't see if they appear? Actually, we know R and A are present? So we must include them? Else we might miss information. Especially we have limited guesses? So we should always include known present letters? Yes.

 Therefore, PLANT has A? But doesn't have R? So it's invalid? We must include both R and A.

 So only words that contain R and A and exclude E,I,S.

 So between ADORN and BROAD? ADORN: A at pos1? If in secret word, is A at pos1? We don't know? We only know it's not at pos2? So same for any position? We don't know? So ADORN seems fine? But ADORN has A at pos1? So we do test A? And R at pos4? Now, let me see: to maximize information? We are covering positions for A and R? We also cover D,O,N in new positions? 

 Now, BROAD: R at pos2 and A at pos4? So more focused on R and A? 

 Actually, both are fine? I'll go with ADORN.

 But note: ADORN has A in one of the positions? We know A could be anywhere except position 2? Position 1 is possible? So why not test that? 

 Also, ADORN gets more vowels? O? And we avoid duplication.

 So I decide to guess ""ADORN"".

 However, let me double-check: ADORN doesn't contain E,I,S? Correct? A,D,O,R,N -> none are E,I,S.

 It's a word? Yes, meaning to decorate.

 So <guess>ADORN</guess>

 Alternatively, if I choose BROAD: 
   If BROAD gets feedback:
      If R is in position2, we get ✓ for R? But we don't know? 
      But ADORN does not put R in a position we already know is wrong? For R, we only know position1 is wrong? So in ADORN, R in position4? We haven't tested position4? So it's fine.

 I'll go with ADORN.Based on the feedback from Guess 1 (RAISE):  
- R and A are in the secret word but not in positions 1 or 2, respectively.  
- I, S, and E are not in the secret word.  

For the second guess, I need a word that:  
1. Includes R and A (since they are confirmed present).  
2. Excludes I, S, and E.  
3. Avoids placing R in position 1 or A in position 2.  
4. Uses distinct common letters to maximize new information.  

I chose ""ADORN"" because it:  
- Places A in position 1 (a new, untested position) and R in position 4 (avoiding the wrong position of 1).  
- Adds new common letters: D, O, and N (O is a frequent vowel, D and N are common consonants).  
- Avoids I, S, E and has no duplicate letters.  

This guess tests new positions for A and R while introducing three additional letters, providing a balanced setup for feedback.

<guess>ADORN</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ADORN -> FEEDBACK: A(-) D(x) O(x) R(-) N(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

**Guess 1: RAISE**
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 1.
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 2.
- I(x): I is not in the word.
- S(x): S is not in the word.
- E(x): E is not in the word.

**Guess 2: ADORN**
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- D(x): D is not in the word.
- O(x): O is not in the word.
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 4.
- N(x): N is not in the word.

**Summary of known information:**
- Present letters (must be included): R and A
- Absent letters: I, S, E, D, O, N
- Incorrect positions:
  - R cannot be in position 1 (from Guess 1) or position 4 (from Guess 2)
  - A cannot be in position 2 (from Guess 1) or position 1 (from Guess 2)

Since R is not in positions 1 or 4, and A is not in positions 1 or 2, we can deduce possible positions:
- R must be in position 2, 3, or 5.
- A must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

We also know the secret word contains exactly R and A as known letters so far? But note: there may be additional letters not yet tested. Also, from the absent list, we exclude I, S, E, D, O, N. So the remaining letters must come from other alphabets.

Let me list letters not used or tested: 
All consonants and vowels except those excluded: 
Excluded: I, S, E, D, O, N (6 letters)
Alphabet has 26, so 20 left? But we've tested: R, A in both; and others: I,S,E,D,O,N.

So untested letters: B,C,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Among these, common letters: T, L, U, C, M, P, H, etc.

We must include both R and A in the next guess, and they must be placed in positions that are currently allowed:

Possible positions for R: 2,3,5  
Possible positions for A: 3,4,5  

The word must fit these constraints and be a valid English word.

Additionally, the new guess should test new letters to gather more information? We have limited guesses left (4 remaining), and we need to find the secret word quickly.

Therefore, we should prioritize words that test multiple common letters while respecting the position constraints.

Consider possible placements:  
- Since A can be in 3,4,5 and R in 2,3,5, we can try to assign them to positions that don't overlap unless required? But overlap might be possible? For example, position 3 could be A or R, but not both? Actually, one letter per position? So we need to decide.

Scenario 1: R in position 2? Then positions for A: 3,4,5  
Scenario 2: R in position 3? Then positions for A: 4,5 (since position 3 is taken? But if R is in pos3, A cannot be at pos3? So only pos4 or5)  
Similarly, R in position 5? Then A in position 3 or4?  

But also, we can have a word where R and A are not at these positions? But we must include both.

Now, given that, let's brainstorm words.

First, let's consider words with R in position 2, since that's the only scenario where R can be in an earlier position.

If R in position 2:  
Then A in position 3,4, or5.

Possible words:  
- Position 1: ? (a new letter)  
- Position 2: R  
- Position 3: A? Or if A elsewhere  
- Position 4: ?  
- Position 5: ?

But we need valid English words.

For example, if R in pos2 and A in pos3: Then we have _ R A ? ?  
Possible: CRAFT? But C-R-A-F-T? But F,T? However, N is out? But CRAFT has A in pos3? And unknown pos4,5? But C,R,A,F,T? Are there other words? TRAWL? But T-R-A-W-L: L? But note TRAWL has A in pos3.

But TRAWL letters: T,R,A,W,L.  
Now, W and L? Also, we haven't tested W and L? And exclude E,I,S,N,O,D? So W and L are allowed? Yes.

But TRAWL: T(not excluded), R, A, W, L.  
Positions:  
1: T?  
2: R? This is allowed?  
3: A? Position 3? But we know A is not in position 2? Position 3 is new?  
However, we also know from ADORN that A is not in position 1? And here position 1 is T? So it's fine?  
But in TRAWL, A is in position 3? So is that possible? Yes.

Similarly, positions:  
R is in position 2? Which we haven't tested?  
A in position 3? Also new?  
We test T, W, L.

Now, alternative: R in position 2 and A in position 4? Then _ R ? A ?  
Example: TRACT? But C and T? But T in both ends? Not distinct? And ""TRACT"" has T repeated? But the secret word might have repeats? We don't know? But for guess, it's okay to repeat? However, since in previous we had distinct? We can do? But to maximize information, it's better to avoid repeats?  

Other word: WRAPT? Not common, but WRAPPED? No, five letters?  
Perhaps WRACK? W-R-A-C-K: Then A is in position 3? Not position 4?  

If A in position 4: _ R ? A ?  
Example: FRUIT? But U? And I is excluded? I cannot be used?  
PLAIT? I excluded? Disallowed.  
GRAVY? G-R-A-V-Y: A in position 3? Again position 3?  

So what about A in position 4? For example, CRAWL: C-R-A-W-L? A in position 3? Still.  
TRAMP: T-R-A-M-P? A in 3? Not 4.  

Perhaps ""PROAL"" not a word?  
""CRWTH""? Not common?  

Another: ""DRABS""? D is excluded? Cannot.  
So, R in position 2 and A in position 4?  
Try ""TROAD""? Not a word?  
""BRAXY""? Not common?  

Actually, common words: How about ""GRACY""? Not a word?  

Perhaps not many? Words like ""CRACK"" but repeats C?  

So maybe for A in position 4: ""WRAPT"" is archaic? Not ideal?  

Alternatively, R in position 3?  
Then positions:  
? ? R ? ?  

R in position 3: must have R there?  
Then A in position 4 or 5?  
Because positions 1,2,3: but position 3 is R? So A must be in 4 or 5?  

For example, with A in position 4: ? ? R A ?  
Possible: FARCE? E excluded.  
BARES? E excluded.  
CARES? E excluded.  
PARTY? P-A-R-T-Y? But A in position 2? Which we know is invalid? Also, P-A? A at position 2? Disallowed.  
GARDE? Not English?  
So ""MARKS""? M-A-R-K-S? But A in position 2? Disallowed? Because A cannot be in position 2? So if I have _ _ R _ _, and I want A in position 4, the word must avoid A in position 2?  

For positions:  
Positions:  
1: ?  
2: ? but not A?  
3: R (fixed)  
4: A  
5: ?  

So for example, UPPER? No.  
Possible words: PURR? Too short?  
What about: BLARE? B-L-A-R-E? E excluded? Also L?  
BLARE? E excluded?  
So with constraints: position 2 cannot be A, position 4 must be A?  
Example: FURCA? Not a word?  
TURMA? Not word?  
""EARTH""? But E excluded?  

Perhaps ""CAROL""? C-A-R-O-L? But O excluded? And A is in position 2? Disallowed? Because A cannot be in position 2?  

Similarly, ""PARAM""? P-A-R-A-M? A in 2? Disallowed?  

Alternative: R in position 3 and A in position 5? Then _ _ R ? A  

Possible words: OPERA? O excluded? E excluded?  
LARVA? L-A-R-V-A? But A in position 2? Disallowed? V? And repeats A?  
BARRA? Not word?  
""WORRY""? O excluded?  
""FERRY""? E excluded?  

""MARAH""? M-A-R-A-H? A in position 2? Disallowed?  

Having trouble?  

Now, try R in position 5? Then we have _ _ _ _ R  
And A must be in position 3 or 4?  
For example, with A in position 3: _ _ A _ R  
Or A in position 4: _ _ _ A R  

Then possible words:  
With A in position 3: Let's say position 1:?, position 2:?, position 3:A, position 4:?, position 5:R?  
Example: C_R? TALAR? But T,A,L,A,R? Not?  
PALAR? P-A-L-A-R? Disallowed because A in position 2? Positions: 1:P, position2:? Must not be A? So position2: L? Then position3: A? So ""PLAAR""? Not word.  
""ULCAR""? U-L-C-A-R? Letters: U,L,C,A,R?  
Position 1: U, 2: L, 3: C, 4: A, 5: R? A in position 4? Allowed?  
Is ULCAR a word? I don't think so. ""ULC"" not common.  

Other: ""VAGAR""? V-A-G-A-R? A in position2? Disallowed?  
""RAKAM""? Not?  
Perhaps common: ""SUGAR""? S excluded? Cannot.  
""VAPOR""? O excluded?  

Another: ""METAL""? E excluded?  
""ULTRA""? U-L-T-R-A?  
But positions: position1:U,2:L,3:T,4:R,5:A?  
So:  
Position3: T? position4: R? position5: A? There?  
But R is in position4? Wait, R cannot be in position4? We know from ADORN feedback that R is not in position4? R(-) in position4? In ADORN, position4 was R and it was marked as '-', meaning present but wrong position? So we cannot put R in position4 again? Or can we? Logically, it won't be correct, so we should avoid position4 for R? But in the rules, we are allowed to guess, but it would be inefficient? Because we already know position4 is wrong?  

So R in position4 should be avoided? Similarly, we avoid positions already tried and marked as wrong?  

Therefore, R in position4 is known wrong? So we cannot use R in position4?  

Similarly, we already know:

For R: wrong positions: 1 and 4  
For A: wrong positions: 1 and 2  

Therefore, valid positions:  
R: 2,3,5  
A: 3,4,5  

But we cannot have R at position4? So it's eliminated?  

Now, back to R in position5? And A in position3 or4?

With A in position3: ? ? A ? R  
Or A in position4: ? ? ? A R  

Then:

If A in position3: _ _ A _ R  
Position1: ?, position2: ? (but not A? Because A in3), position3:A, position4:?, position5:R  

And word must not use absent letters?  

Possible: LATCH? But E? CH for letters? C,H? Let's find English words?  

""PATHY""? Not?  
"" MAGAR""? M-A-G-A-R? A in position2? Disallowed?  
""BAGAR""? Same?  

Alternative: ""VALID""? But V,A,L,I,D? I excluded?  

""FATAL""? F-A-T-A-L? A in position2? Disallowed?  

Hard.

With A in position4: _ _ _ A R  
Example: ""ULTRA"": U-L-T-R-A? But positions: 1:U,2:L,3:T,4:R,5:A  
But R is in position4? Which we know is wrong? So if the secret word has R not in position4, we'll get '-'? But we already know that from ADORN? And we shouldn't repeat?  
So to save a guess, avoid R in position4?  

Other words: ""EXTRA""? E and X? E excluded?  
""GATHA""? Not?  
""MITRA""? I excluded?  

Perhaps ""MATCH""? Doesn't work?  

Another idea: R in position3 and A in position4 or5?  
We try that?  

For example, R in position3 and A in position4: ? ? R A ?  
Possible: BAR_? But B-A-R? A in position2? Disallowed?  
CAR_? C-A-R? A in position2? Disallowed?  

But position1 and position2 should not have A?  
So for ? ? R A ?:  
Position1: not A  
Position2: not A  
Position3: R  
Position4: A  
Position5: ?

So e.g., TURFA? U, F? Not common?  
PUREA? P-U-R-E-A? E excluded?  

""LARVA"": L-A-R-V-A? A in position2? Disallowed?  

""FORAM""? O excluded?  

""MERCH""? E excluded?  

Possible: ""CURAT""? C-U-R-A-T? U? T?  
Letters: C,U,R,A,T?  
Are C,U,T allowed? Yes?  
Positions:  
1: C  
2: U  
3: R  
4: A  
5: T

CURAT is a word? Checking: CURAT is not common? CURATE? Six letters.  

""BURKA""? B-U-R-K-A? A in position5?  
Positions: 1:B,2:U,3:R,4:K,5:A  
Then A is in position5? This is for R in position3 and A in position5.  

BURKA is a word? Yes, a type of garment.

So BURKA: B,U,R,K,A

But what about position2? It's U? We haven't tested U? 

Also, we must avoid O,E,I,S,N,D? U is not excluded? So BURKA is possible? 

But let's confirm: R in position3?  
A in position5?  
Position2: U? Also, B and K new? 

Now, valid? 

Similarly, ""HURRA"" not a word?  
""JUROR"" O excluded?  

Another: ""PURRA"" not word?  

Since R in position3 is fixed, and A in position5? Then other positions: any of the letters not excluded? 

Perhaps ""CURTA"" not word?  

Back to R in position2? Which seems easier? 

If R in position2 and A in position5: ? R ? A ?  
Then positions 1,3,4 need to be filled with letters not excluded?  

For example: CRAFT? C-R-A-F-T? But A here is in position3?  
If A in position5: then ? R ? ? A?  
Example: TRUFA? Not word?  
BRUSH? U,S excluded?  
FRUIT? I excluded?  
CRAWL? C-R-A-W-L? A in position3? For A in position5: ? R ? ? A  
Like ""BARRA"" not?  
""FERRA"" E excluded?  

""WORMA"" O and A? But A at position5?  

Actually, ""GRAMA"" G-R-A-M-A? Repeats A?  
Letters: G,R,A,M,A?  
But position3: A? Then position5:A?  
But the secret word might have double A? But we can't assume?  

Given the difficulty, let's list words that include R and A, exclude E,I,S,D,O,N, and have positions where R is not in 1 or 4, A not in 1 or 2? And letters from B,C,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? And valid English.

Possible word: ""TRAMP""
- T-R-A-M-P
- Positions: R in position2 (allowed)
- A in position3 ( allowed? Yes? Because not position2)
- But does it violate? R in position2: allowed A in position3: allowed
- Also, no excluded letters? T, M, P: not in absent list.

""TRAMP"": T,R,A,M,P
Feedback: T,R,A,M,P? Exclude E,I,S,D,O,N? Yes.

But is TRAMP a word? Yes.

Another: ""TRAWL"" T,R,A,W,L
- R in position2, A in position3? But position3 for A? Is this allowed? Yes, A is not forbidden in position3? Only positions 1 and 2 are forbidden? So in TRAMP and TRAWL, A is in position3? That's fine.

We can also try ""GRAPH""? G-R-A-P-H? A in position3? Yes.
But G,R,A,P,H? H? P? G? All allowed.

But TRAWL has W and L? Which are common? TRAMP has M and P? 

Perhaps TRAMP is better? Or whatever.

But also, we must include R and A? Both have them.

Now, comparing to ADORN and RAISE, TRAWL or TRAMP?

In TRAWL: positions 1:T, 2:R, 3:A, 4:W,5:L? 
R in position2: we haven't tested position2? So this will tell us if position2 is correct? If it is, we get R(✓)? If not, R(-)? 
Similarly, A in position3: new position? 
And T,W,L tested.

Similarly for TRAMP.

But note in TRAMP: position4 is M and position5 is P? 
Both have T in position1? 

Given that, I think TRAWL is a valid choice? Or TRAMP?

Another: ""CRAWL"" C-R-A-W-L? Position1:C, not tested? Better than T? But T is common? 

In the first guess RAISE, T wasn't used? So introducing T is good.

So TRAMP: T,R,A,M,P

or TRAWL: T,R,A,W,L

Both good? 

I'll pick ""TRAMP"" because it tests M and P, which are common.

But to maximize, perhaps TRAMP? 

But let me see if there's a word with R in position3 or5? 

With R in position3 and A in position4: We had trouble? But BURKA with A in position5? 
BURKA: B,U,R,K,A 
- Positions: 1:B,2:U,3:R,4:K,5:A? 
This places R in position3 (new) and A in position5 (new) 
And tests B,U,K. 

U is vowel? And B,K are not as common? But BURKA is a valid word? 

Compared to TRAMP: T common, R in2, A in3? 

Perhaps TRAMP is more standard? 

Given the time, I'll go with TRAMP.

But in TRAMP, is position for A: position3? We know from previous that A is in the word, not in pos2? So pos3 is untested?  

The secret word could have A in pos3? Or not? 

So I guess ""TRAMP"" . 

<guess>TRAMP</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

Based on the feedback:
- **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: R and A are in the word but not in positions 1 or 2. I, S, and E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (ADORN)**: A and R are in the word but not in positions 1 or 4. D, O, and N are absent.
  
**Key insights**:
- **Confirmed letters**: R and A must appear in the new guess.
- **Absent letters**: I, S, E, D, O, N cannot be used.
- **Position constraints**:
  - R cannot be in positions 1 or 4 (from Guess 1 and Guess 2).
  - A cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (from Guess 1 and Guess 2).
- **Possible positions**:
  - R: Positions 2, 3, or 5.
- A: Positions 3, 4, or 5.
- **Available letters**: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (since E, I, S, D, O, N are excluded).

**Strategy**:  
- Prioritize words with R and A in allowed positions while introducing new common letters (e.g., T, L, M, P) to maximize information.
- R in position 2 and A in position 3 are plausible focus areas, as these positions are untested and common in English words.
- Avoid repeating letters for efficiency.

**Selected word: ""TRAMP""**  
- **Structure**: T-R-A-M-P
  - Position 1: T (new letter, untested)
  - Position 2: R (allowed; not position 1 or 4)
  - Position 3: A (allowed; not position 1 or 2)
  - Position 4: M (new letter)
  - Position 5: P (new letter)
- **Why TRAMP?**:
  - Tests R and A in new positions (R in pos 2, A in pos 3).
  - Introduces T, M, P—high-frequency consonants.
  - Avoids constraints and absent letters.
  - Balanced mix of common letters; valid 5-letter word with no duplicates.

This guess will clarify:
- If R is in position 2 (✓ or -).
- If A is in position 3 (✓ or -).
- Presence/absence of T, M, P.

Since it\'s the first guess, I have no prior feedback, so I should choose a word that maximizes the information I get.\n\nA common strategy in Wordle is to start with words that have a good mix of common vowels and consonants. This helps in identifying which letters are present or absent.\n\nI recall that words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ROAST"" are popular starters because they contain frequent letters. But I should pick one that covers different possibilities.\n\nLet me think about letter frequency in English words. According to common knowledge, vowels like E, A, I, O, U are frequent, and consonants like R, S, T, L, N are also common.\n\nTo cover multiple common letters, words like ""ARISE"" or ""RAISE"" might be good. But I want to maximize coverage.\n\nPerhaps ""CRATE"" – it has C, R, A, T, E. That\'s one vowel and four consonants.\n\nAnother one is ""SLICE"" with S, L, I, C, E.\n\nI think ""CRANE"" is a solid first guess. Let me confirm: C, R, A, N, E. That includes three vowels? A and E are vowels, C is consonant, R consonant, N consonant. Actually, two vowels: A and E.\n\nA and E are vowels, but I is also common. Maybe ""RAISE"" is better: R, A, I, S, E – that has three vowels: A, I, E.\n\nVowels: A, E, I, O, U. In ""RAISE"", A, I, E are vowels, so three vowels. In ""CRANE"", A and E are vowels, so two vowels. More vowels might be better for testing.\n\nBut consonants are important too. Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N.\n\nSo, a word like ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E – that\'s S, L, T consonants and A, E vowels.\n\n""ROAST"" has R, O, A, S, T – R, S, T consonants and O, A vowels.\n\nI should aim for a word with no repeating letters to maximize distinct letters.\n\nYes, all guesses should have unique letters to get more information.\n\nSo, for first guess, priority is: common letters, no repeats.\n\nLet\'s list some top starters based on Wordle strategies:\n\n- ""CRANE""\n\n- ""SLATE""\n\n- ""RAISE""\n\n- ""ROATE"" (not a common word, but used)\n\n""ADIEU"" has A, D, I, E, U – four vowels, but D might be less common.\n\nI think ""SOARE"" is used, but not common.\n\nI\'ll go with ""CRANE"" for my first guess. It has C, R, A, N, E – all common letters, and C and N might test less frequent ones.\n\nBut according to frequency, E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U are top.\n\nE is most frequent.\n\nSo words with E, A, R, T, S are good.\n\n""SALET"" or ""CRATE"".\n\nI think ""CRANE"" is fine.\n\nTo be systematic, I\'ll choose ""RAISE"": R, A, I, S, E – includes R, A, I, S, E – all high frequency.\n\nR, A, S are top consonants, E is top vowel, I is vowel.\n\nYes, ""RAISE"" seems excellent.\n\nIn the rules, I need to output in specific format.\n\nSo, for my first guess, I\'ll guess ""RAISE"".\n\nBut let me confirm it\'s a valid 5-letter word. ""Raise"" – yes, it\'s common.\n\nPerhaps ""ARISE"" is similar.\n\nI\'ll go with ""RAISE"".For the first guess in Wordle, I need to choose a word that maximizes the potential for useful feedback. Since there\'s no prior information, I should select a word with common letters to increase the chances of identifying correct letters or positions. Common starting words often include a mix of frequent vowels and consonants, with all letters distinct to cover more possibilities.\n\nKey considerations:\n- Letter frequency in English: E, A, R, I, S are among the most common (based on corpus data).\n- Including multiple vowels can help test for essential word structure.\n- Words like ""RAISE"", ""CRANE"", or ""SLATE"" are popular starters for this reason.\n\nAfter evaluating options:\n- ""RAISE"" contains R, A, I, S, E – all high-frequency letters.\n- It has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).\n- No repeated letters, so each position provides unique information.\n- It\'s a valid 5-letter English word.\n\nThis guess should provide good feedback on whether any of these letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.\n\n<guess>RAISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for Guess 1: RAISE -> R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)\n This means:\n   R is in the word but in the wrong position.\n   A is in the word but in the wrong position.\n   I is not in the word.\n   S is not in the word.\n   E is not in the word.\n\n So, from this:\n   - The secret word contains R and A, but not in the first and second positions respectively.\n   - The word does not contain I, S, E.\n\n Since R is in the word but not position 1, it must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. However, note that in the feedback, R was in position 1 but marked wrong, so it can\'t be position 1. Similarly, A was in position 2 and marked wrong so it can\'t be in position 2.\n\n Also, the word does not have I, S, E.\n\n We must guess a new 5-letter word that must include R and A (since they are in the word), and exclude I, S, E.\n\n Moreover, we know R cannot be in position 1 and A cannot be in position 2.\n\n Let\'s think about possible placements for R and A.\n\n We need to choose a word that has R in a position other than 1, and A in a position other than 2.\n\n Since we have only one previous guess, we don\'t know much about the exact positions, so we can try to cover other common letters and also test new positions for R and A.\n\n Let\'s consider what letters are available. We know E, I, S are out. So we avoid these.\n\n Common letters left: T, O, N, L, U, D, C, M, P, etc.\n\n Since the word has R and A, we can include these and add other frequent letters.\n\n We have 6 tries, so we can try to get more information.\n\n We might try a word that has R and A in different positions and introduces new common letters.\n\n But note: we must not put R in position 1 and A in position 2.\n\n Let me try to list possibilities for R: positions 2,3,4,5\n For A: positions 1,3,4,5 (because it can\'t be 2)\n\n However, if we put A in position 1, that would be a possibility we haven\'t tested.\n\n We can try to put R in position 4 or 5 and A in position 1 or 3 or 4 or 5 (but not 2).\n\n One idea: start with A in a new position, and R in a new position, and add T, O, N which are common.\n\n Consider ""TAROT"": but that has T and O? Also, TAROT has repeated T? Actually, it has T twice? Let\'s check: T-A-R-O-T -> repeated T. Also, we need to avoid S, I, E.\n\n Another word: ""RADAR"" has repeated A and R? Not good because repeated letters and we don\'t know if the secret word has repeats.\n\n Since we don\'t know if there are repeats, it\'s safer to try a word with distinct letters.\n\n So, what about ""PLANT""? But we have E, I, S out? But P,L,A,N,T. But A is included? Yes. But where do we put R? We haven\'t included R. Remember R is present so we must include R in the guess because we know it\'s in the word.\n\n Important: we must include the letters that the feedback told us are present: R and A.\n\n So, the next guess must contain R and A, and must not contain I, S, E.\n\n And distinct letters if possible.\n\n So, let\'s think:\n\n We need to place R and A in positions other than R in 1 and A in 2.\n\n We can have:\n\n Position 1: not R (but can be A or another letter)\n Position 2: not A (but can be R? Wait, feedback from RAISE: R was in position 1 and was shown to be present but wrong position. So if we put R in position 2, that\'s allowed because we haven\'t tested R in position 2 before. Similarly, A in position 1 is allowed.\n\n However, note that R being present implies it is in the word somewhere, but we don\'t know where. Similarly for A.\n\n So, for guess 2, we can have:\n\n Option: put A in position 1 and R in position 3? Or R in position 5? Etc.\n\n Now, for the remaining letters: we need three more letters that are not I,S,E and are not duplicated.\n\n Let\'s choose common consonants and vowels excluding E,I,S.\n\n We have vowels: O,U,A (A we already have) but we need consonants? Actually, since A is included, we can use consonants.\n\n Common letters left: T, O, L, N, U, D, C, M, P, etc.\n\n We can form words with A and R and three of these.\n\n Possible words:\n\n - ""CAROM"": C-A-R-O-M -> letters C,A,R,O,M -> must check if valid. Carom is a word? Yes, meaning to strike and rebound. But it has R in position 3? And A in position 2? Wait, position 2 is A? But in feedback, we were told A is in the word but not in position 2? However, for the new guess, we don\'t know if position 2 might be the correct place? Wait no: In the previous feedback, A was in the second position (in RAISE) and marked as wrong position? That means the secret word has A, but it is not in position 2. So putting A in position 2 in a new guess is disallowed because we know A is not in position 2? Or can we still put it? No, because the feedback rule: the symbol (\'-\') means that the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, but it doesn\'t prevent us from guessing it again in the same position. However, logically, if we know that position 2 is wrong for A, we should avoid putting A in position 2 to avoid wasting a guess. Similarly, for R we know position 1 is wrong.\n\n Therefore, in the new guess, we should avoid:\n - R in position 1\n - A in position 2\n\n So for ""CAROM"": if I write C-A-R-O-M, then A is in position 2? That would be bad because we know A cannot be in position 2. So we should avoid that.\n\n Similarly, if I have a word starting with R (position 1) we know it\'s wrong.\n\n So, let me brainstorm words without R in 1 and without A in 2.\n\n Possibilities:\n\n Position 1: Any letter except R? Or except I,S,E? Actually any letter except R? We can put R elsewhere.\n\n How about ""FARCE""? F-A-R-C-E -> but E is excluded. We can\'t use E.\n\n Or ""YARTH""? Not a word.\n\n Word: ""OCTAL"" but missing R? We need R because we have to include the known letters.\n\n How about ""PARTY"": \n   P-A-R-T-Y -> \n      Position: 1: P (new, not R)\n      Position 2: A -> this is position 2? But we cannot put A in position 2 because we know from feedback that A is not in position 2? So even though we are including A (which we know is in the word) we must avoid position 2 for A.\n\n Therefore, PARTY is invalid because A is in position 2.\n\n Another word: ""TRAWL"": \n   T-R-A-W-L -> \n      Position 1: T (new)\n      Position 2: R -> but is R allowed in position 2? Let\'s see: in the feedback for RAISE, R was in position 1 and marked as wrong position. We don\'t know about position 2. So yes, R can be in position 2.\n\n   But position 3: A -> which is position 3? That\'s not position 2 so it\'s allowed.\n\n So ""TRAWL"": \n   T (not E,I,S), R (in position 2: but we don\'t know if this is the correct position for R), A (position 3: safe because not position 2), W (new), L (new).\n   Also, doesn\'t include I,S,E.\n\n But are we using the known presence? Yes, R and A are in the word.\n\n However, let\'s check if TRAWL is a word? Yes: to fish with a trawl net.\n\n Now, the problem: we are testing R in position 2 and A in position 3. But in the secret word, R and A might be in other positions. But that\'s okay because we might get feedback that they are not in these positions.\n\n Alternatively, we can avoid putting R and A in positions we suspect might be wrong? But we have no information except they are not in position 1 (R) and position 2 (A).\n\n An alternative: ""CARTY""? Not a word.\n\n ""DARAT""? Not a word.\n\n ""MAROON""? Too long.\n\n Another word: ""CRANK"": \n   C-R-A-N-K -> \n      Position 2: R? (allowed) \n      Position 3: A? (position 3 is not 2, so allowed) \n      But position 1: C? We haven\'t tested C. \n      But wait. In RAISE, we used R in pos1, A in pos2, etc. Now CRANK has R in pos2? Yes.\n\n But note: we know that E, I, S are out. N and K are new.\n\n CRANK is a word.\n\n However, we know that E, I, S are not in the word, but not that C is not? So including C is fine.\n\n But we are also missing R and A? We have R in position 2 and A in position 3.\n\n How about ""DRAWL"" but D-A? A in position 2? Avoid.\n\n Let me try to list:\n\n Without E,I,S and avoiding R in position 1 and A in position 2.\n\n How about:\n   Position 1: T or L or O, etc.\n   Position 2: R? (if we want to test R here) or other but not A? Actually we cannot put A in position 2, so we can put any other letter? But we want to get feedback on other positions.\n\n Another common word: ""ROAST"" but starts with R? That\'s position 1? We know R is not in position 1? So we must avoid putting R in position 1.\n\n Therefore, we cannot use ROAST.\n\n How about ""TAROT""? T-A-R-O-T -> A in position 2? Disallowed. And also repeated T? Not ideal.\n\n Perhaps ""BROAD"": \n   B-R-O-A-D -> \n        Position 2: R? Allowed.\n        Position 4: A? Allowed (since not position 2).\n\n BROAD is a word? Yes.\n\n Also, BROAD: B, R, O, A, D -> new letters B, O, D, plus R and A.\n\n And avoids E,I,S.\n\n This seems better because we have R in position 2 and A in position 4? Positions: \n   1: B\n   2: R\n   3: O\n   4: A\n   5: D\n\n This puts R in a position we haven\'t tested (position 2) and A in position 4 (which we haven\'t tested). Also, we test O and D and B.\n\n But note: in RAISE, R was in position 1 and now we put R in position 2? We don\'t know if it might be correct? We don\'t have any information about position 2.\n\n Similarly, A was in position 2 in RAISE and now we put it in position 4.\n\n How about another word: ""CRAMP"": \n   C-R-A-M-P -> \n      R in pos2, A in pos3? Allowed? Yes.\n\n But CRAMP has M and P? Also good.\n\n CRAMP is a word.\n\n But BROAD might be better because it tests a vowel O? Or CRAMP tests consonants? \n\n Since we don\'t know how many vowels are in the word? We know A is present and we avoided E,I (and O,U might be present).\n\n Given the feedback that RAISE had two yellows and three blacks, it\'s possible that the word has R, A, and three other letters.\n\n Let me think of the most frequent letters left: T, O, N, L, R, A are taken? R and A are in the word? So T, O, N, L are good choices to test.\n\n So perhaps BROAD (with O) or TRAIN? But TRAIN has A in position 3? Allowed, but I is not allowed? TRAIN has I? T-R-A-I-N -> I is excluded? So TRAIN is invalid.\n\n Similarly, ""TRAWL"" is valid? T-R-A-W-L -> has L? and W? \n\n What about ""GRAND"": \n   G-R-A-N-D -> \n      R in pos2, A in pos3? Allowed? Yes. \n      Letters: G, R, A, N, D -> avoids E,I,S? Yes.\n\n GRAND is a word.\n\n I think any of BROAD, CRAMP, GRAND, TRAWL are possible.\n\n I\'ll pick BROAD because it uses common letters: B, R, O, A, D and covers O (a vowel) as well as D and B.\n\n Also, note that we might get feedback indicating if R is in position 2? and A in position 4? If one is at the right place, we\'ll get a ✓.\n\n Alternatively, if not, we\'ll get \'-\' or \'x\' for R and A? But we know they are present? So at worst, we\'ll get \'-\' for R and A? Because they are in the word.\n\n But we are putting R in a new position (2) and A in a new position (4). So if the secret word has R in position 2, we get ✓? But if it has R in another position, we get \'-\' (because we put R in position 2 and then we know it\'s not at position 2? Actually, no: we know R is present? So if we put R in position 2 and it\'s not the right position, we\'ll get \'-\'. Similarly for A at position 4.\n\n Additionally, we test B, O, D.\n\n Considering that, BROAD seems fine.\n\n But let me also consider ""TARGO"" not a word.\n\n Another word: ""ROUND"": cannot because R in position 1? Disallowed? Because R in position 1 we know won\'t be correct? So avoid.\n\n How about ""ADORN"": \n   A-D-O-R-N -> \n        A in position 1? What do we know about A? We only know that A is not in position 2? Position 1 is allowed? Because nothing said position 1 cannot be A. \n        Then D, O, R in position 4, N.\n\n So ADORN: \n   Position 1: A (allowed? We haven\'t tested A in position 1? Only position 2? So yes, we can try A in position 1? But does the feedback say anything about position 1? In RAISE, the first position was R, and the second was A? So A wasn\'t in position 1? We don\'t know? Actually, we haven\'t tested A in position 1? So putting A in position 1 is possible? But wait: we know A is in the word? So if we put A in position 1 and it\'s correct, we\'ll get ✓? Or if it\'s not? Then we\'ll know.\n\n ADORN: A in pos1, D in pos2, O in pos3, R in pos4, N in pos5.\n\n This avoids position 2 for A? Yes, because here A is in position 1? And we know A is not in position 2? So position 1 is safe? Also, R is in position 4? Not position 1? So safe.\n\n So ADORN is also a candidate? ADORN: A, D, O, R, N -> letters new: D, O, N.\n\n Compared to BROAD: BROAD uses B, O, D? Same as?\n\n BROAD: B,R,O,A,D -> B and then O and D? Also N? No.\n\n ADORN has N? Which is common? Yes.\n\n Both avoid E,I,S.\n\n Which is better? ADORN has A in position 1 (which we haven\'t tried) and R in position 4 (new). Also, we test D, O, N.\n\n BROAD has R in position 2? And we haven\'t tried R in position 2? And A in position 4? And tests B.\n\n Personally, I think ADORN is better? Because it tests A in a new position (1) and R in position 4? And adds O, D, N? All common.\n\n BROAD: position 1: B? Not as common? But valid.\n\n Alternatively, let me consider ""PLANT"" again? But without R? Yes? We must include R? We cannot omit R? We must include the known yellow letters? Otherwise, we won\'t see if they appear? Actually, we know R and A are present? So we must include them? Else we might miss information. Especially we have limited guesses? So we should always include known present letters? Yes.\n\n Therefore, PLANT has A? But doesn\'t have R? So it\'s invalid? We must include both R and A.\n\n So only words that contain R and A and exclude E,I,S.\n\n So between ADORN and BROAD? ADORN: A at pos1? If in secret word, is A at pos1? We don\'t know? We only know it\'s not at pos2? So same for any position? We don\'t know? So ADORN seems fine? But ADORN has A at pos1? So we do test A? And R at pos4? Now, let me see: to maximize information? We are covering positions for A and R? We also cover D,O,N in new positions? \n\n Now, BROAD: R at pos2 and A at pos4? So more focused on R and A? \n\n Actually, both are fine? I\'ll go with ADORN.\n\n But note: ADORN has A in one of the positions? We know A could be anywhere except position 2? Position 1 is possible? So why not test that? \n\n Also, ADORN gets more vowels? O? And we avoid duplication.\n\n So I decide to guess ""ADORN"".\n\n However, let me double-check: ADORN doesn\'t contain E,I,S? Correct? A,D,O,R,N -> none are E,I,S.\n\n It\'s a word? Yes, meaning to decorate.\n\n So <guess>ADORN</guess>\n\n Alternatively, if I choose BROAD: \n   If BROAD gets feedback:\n      If R is in position2, we get ✓ for R? But we don\'t know? \n      But ADORN does not put R in a position we already know is wrong? For R, we only know position1 is wrong? So in ADORN, R in position4? We haven\'t tested position4? So it\'s fine.\n\n I\'ll go with ADORN.Based on the feedback from Guess 1 (RAISE):  \n- R and A are in the secret word but not in positions 1 or 2, respectively.  \n- I, S, and E are not in the secret word.  \n\nFor the second guess, I need a word that:  \n1. Includes R and A (since they are confirmed present).  \n2. Excludes I, S, and E.  \n3. Avoids placing R in position 1 or A in position 2.  \n4. Uses distinct common letters to maximize new information.  \n\nI chose ""ADORN"" because it:  \n- Places A in position 1 (a new, untested position) and R in position 4 (avoiding the wrong position of 1).  \n- Adds new common letters: D, O, and N (O is a frequent vowel, D and N are common consonants).  \n- Avoids I, S, E and has no duplicate letters.  \n\nThis guess tests new positions for A and R while introducing three additional letters, providing a balanced setup for feedback.\n\n<guess>ADORN</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ADORN -> FEEDBACK: A(-) D(x) O(x) R(-) N(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\n**Guess 1: RAISE**\n- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 1.\n- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 2.\n- I(x): I is not in the word.\n- S(x): S is not in the word.\n- E(x): E is not in the word.\n\n**Guess 2: ADORN**\n- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.\n- D(x): D is not in the word.\n- O(x): O is not in the word.\n- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 4.\n- N(x): N is not in the word.\n\n**Summary of known information:**\n- Present letters (must be included): R and A\n- Absent letters: I, S, E, D, O, N\n- Incorrect positions:\n  - R cannot be in position 1 (from Guess 1) or position 4 (from Guess 2)\n  - A cannot be in position 2 (from Guess 1) or position 1 (from Guess 2)\n\nSince R is not in positions 1 or 4, and A is not in positions 1 or 2, we can deduce possible positions:\n- R must be in position 2, 3, or 5.\n- A must be in position 3, 4, or 5.\n\nWe also know the secret word contains exactly R and A as known letters so far? But note: there may be additional letters not yet tested. Also, from the absent list, we exclude I, S, E, D, O, N. So the remaining letters must come from other alphabets.\n\nLet me list letters not used or tested: \nAll consonants and vowels except those excluded: \nExcluded: I, S, E, D, O, N (6 letters)\nAlphabet has 26, so 20 left? But we\'ve tested: R, A in both; and others: I,S,E,D,O,N.\n\nSo untested letters: B,C,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z\n\nAmong these, common letters: T, L, U, C, M, P, H, etc.\n\nWe must include both R and A in the next guess, and they must be placed in positions that are currently allowed:\n\nPossible positions for R: 2,3,5  \nPossible positions for A: 3,4,5  \n\nThe word must fit these constraints and be a valid English word.\n\nAdditionally, the new guess should test new letters to gather more information? We have limited guesses left (4 remaining), and we need to find the secret word quickly.\n\nTherefore, we should prioritize words that test multiple common letters while respecting the position constraints.\n\nConsider possible placements:  \n- Since A can be in 3,4,5 and R in 2,3,5, we can try to assign them to positions that don\'t overlap unless required? But overlap might be possible? For example, position 3 could be A or R, but not both? Actually, one letter per position? So we need to decide.\n\nScenario 1: R in position 2? Then positions for A: 3,4,5  \nScenario 2: R in position 3? Then positions for A: 4,5 (since position 3 is taken? But if R is in pos3, A cannot be at pos3? So only pos4 or5)  \nSimilarly, R in position 5? Then A in position 3 or4?  \n\nBut also, we can have a word where R and A are not at these positions? But we must include both.\n\nNow, given that, let\'s brainstorm words.\n\nFirst, let\'s consider words with R in position 2, since that\'s the only scenario where R can be in an earlier position.\n\nIf R in position 2:  \nThen A in position 3,4, or5.\n\nPossible words:  \n- Position 1: ? (a new letter)  \n- Position 2: R  \n- Position 3: A? Or if A elsewhere  \n- Position 4: ?  \n- Position 5: ?\n\nBut we need valid English words.\n\nFor example, if R in pos2 and A in pos3: Then we have _ R A ? ?  \nPossible: CRAFT? But C-R-A-F-T? But F,T? However, N is out? But CRAFT has A in pos3? And unknown pos4,5? But C,R,A,F,T? Are there other words? TRAWL? But T-R-A-W-L: L? But note TRAWL has A in pos3.\n\nBut TRAWL letters: T,R,A,W,L.  \nNow, W and L? Also, we haven\'t tested W and L? And exclude E,I,S,N,O,D? So W and L are allowed? Yes.\n\nBut TRAWL: T(not excluded), R, A, W, L.  \nPositions:  \n1: T?  \n2: R? This is allowed?  \n3: A? Position 3? But we know A is not in position 2? Position 3 is new?  \nHowever, we also know from ADORN that A is not in position 1? And here position 1 is T? So it\'s fine?  \nBut in TRAWL, A is in position 3? So is that possible? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, positions:  \nR is in position 2? Which we haven\'t tested?  \nA in position 3? Also new?  \nWe test T, W, L.\n\nNow, alternative: R in position 2 and A in position 4? Then _ R ? A ?  \nExample: TRACT? But C and T? But T in both ends? Not distinct? And ""TRACT"" has T repeated? But the secret word might have repeats? We don\'t know? But for guess, it\'s okay to repeat? However, since in previous we had distinct? We can do? But to maximize information, it\'s better to avoid repeats?  \n\nOther word: WRAPT? Not common, but WRAPPED? No, five letters?  \nPerhaps WRACK? W-R-A-C-K: Then A is in position 3? Not position 4?  \n\nIf A in position 4: _ R ? A ?  \nExample: FRUIT? But U? And I is excluded? I cannot be used?  \nPLAIT? I excluded? Disallowed.  \nGRAVY? G-R-A-V-Y: A in position 3? Again position 3?  \n\nSo what about A in position 4? For example, CRAWL: C-R-A-W-L? A in position 3? Still.  \nTRAMP: T-R-A-M-P? A in 3? Not 4.  \n\nPerhaps ""PROAL"" not a word?  \n""CRWTH""? Not common?  \n\nAnother: ""DRABS""? D is excluded? Cannot.  \nSo, R in position 2 and A in position 4?  \nTry ""TROAD""? Not a word?  \n""BRAXY""? Not common?  \n\nActually, common words: How about ""GRACY""? Not a word?  \n\nPerhaps not many? Words like ""CRACK"" but repeats C?  \n\nSo maybe for A in position 4: ""WRAPT"" is archaic? Not ideal?  \n\nAlternatively, R in position 3?  \nThen positions:  \n? ? R ? ?  \n\nR in position 3: must have R there?  \nThen A in position 4 or 5?  \nBecause positions 1,2,3: but position 3 is R? So A must be in 4 or 5?  \n\nFor example, with A in position 4: ? ? R A ?  \nPossible: FARCE? E excluded.  \nBARES? E excluded.  \nCARES? E excluded.  \nPARTY? P-A-R-T-Y? But A in position 2? Which we know is invalid? Also, P-A? A at position 2? Disallowed.  \nGARDE? Not English?  \nSo ""MARKS""? M-A-R-K-S? But A in position 2? Disallowed? Because A cannot be in position 2? So if I have _ _ R _ _, and I want A in position 4, the word must avoid A in position 2?  \n\nFor positions:  \nPositions:  \n1: ?  \n2: ? but not A?  \n3: R (fixed)  \n4: A  \n5: ?  \n\nSo for example, UPPER? No.  \nPossible words: PURR? Too short?  \nWhat about: BLARE? B-L-A-R-E? E excluded? Also L?  \nBLARE? E excluded?  \nSo with constraints: position 2 cannot be A, position 4 must be A?  \nExample: FURCA? Not a word?  \nTURMA? Not word?  \n""EARTH""? But E excluded?  \n\nPerhaps ""CAROL""? C-A-R-O-L? But O excluded? And A is in position 2? Disallowed? Because A cannot be in position 2?  \n\nSimilarly, ""PARAM""? P-A-R-A-M? A in 2? Disallowed?  \n\nAlternative: R in position 3 and A in position 5?

E excluded?  \n\n""MARAH""? M-A-R-A-H? A in position 2? Disallowed?  \n\nHaving trouble?  \n\nNow, try R in position 5? Then we have _ _ _ _ R  \nAnd A must be in position 3 or 4?  \nFor example, with A in position 3: _ _ A _ R  \nOr A in position 4: _ _ _ A R  \n\nThen possible words:  \nWith A in position 3: Let\'s say position 1:?, position 2:?, position 3:A, position 4:?, position 5:R?  \nExample: C_R? TALAR? But T,A,L,A,R? Not?  \nPALAR? P-A-L-A-R? Disallowed because A in position 2? Positions: 1:P, position2:? Must not be A? So position2: L? Then position3: A? So ""PLAAR""? Not word.  \n""ULCAR""? U-L-C-A-R? Letters: U,L,C,A,R?  \nPosition 1: U, 2: L, 3: C, 4: A, 5: R? A in position 4? Allowed?  \nIs ULCAR a word? I don\'t think so. ""ULC"" not common.  \n\nOther: ""VAGAR""? V-A-G-A-R? A in position2? Disallowed?  \n""RAKAM""? Not?  \nPerhaps common: ""SUGAR""? S excluded? Cannot.  \n""VAPOR""? O excluded?  \n\nAnother: ""METAL""? E excluded?  \n""ULTRA""? U-L-T-R-A?  \nBut positions: position1:U,2:L,3:T,4:R,5:A?  \nSo:  \nPosition3: T? position4: R? position5: A? There?  \nBut R is in position4? Wait, R cannot be in position4? We know from ADORN feedback that R is not in position4? R(-) in position4? In ADORN, position4 was R and it was marked as \'-\', meaning present but wrong position? So we cannot put R in position4 again? Or can we? Logically, it won\'t be correct, so we should avoid position4 for R? But in the rules, we are allowed to guess, but it would be inefficient? Because we already know position4 is wrong?  \n\nSo R in position4 should be avoided? Similarly, we avoid positions already tried and marked as wrong?  \n\nTherefore, R in position4 is known wrong? So we cannot use R in position4?  \n\nSimilarly, we already know:\n\nFor R: wrong positions: 1 and 4  \nFor A: wrong positions: 1 and 2  \n\nTherefore, valid positions:  \nR: 2,3,5  \nA: 3,4,5  \n\nBut we cannot have R at position4? So it\'s eliminated?  \n\nNow, back to R in position5? And A in position3 or4?\n\nWith A in position3: ? ? A ? R  \nOr A in position4: ? ? ? A R  \n\nThen:\n\nIf A in position3: _ _ A _ R  \nPosition1: ?, position2: ? (but not A? Because A in3), position3:A, position4:?, position5:R  \n\nAnd word must not use absent letters?  \n\nPossible: LATCH? But E? CH for letters? C,H? Let\'s find English words?  \n\n""PATHY""? Not?  \n"" MAGAR""? M-A-G-A-R? A in position2? Disallowed?  \n""BAGAR""? Same?  \n\nAlternative: ""VALID""? But V,A,L,I,D? I excluded?  \n\n""FATAL""? F-A-T-A-L? A in position2? Disallowed?  \n\nHard.\n\nWith A in position4: _ _ _ A R  \nExample: ""ULTRA"": U-L-T-R-A? But positions: 1:U,2:L,3:T,4:R,5:A  \nBut R is in position4? Which we know is wrong? So if the secret word has R not in position4, we\'ll get \'-\'? But we already know that from ADORN? And we shouldn\'t repeat?  \nSo to save a guess, avoid R in position4?  \n\nOther words: ""EXTRA""? E and X? E excluded?  \n""GATHA""? Not?  \n""MITRA""? I excluded?  \n\nPerhaps ""MATCH""? Doesn\'t work?  \n\nAnother idea: R in position3 and A in position4 or5?  \nWe try that?  \n\nFor example, R in position3 and A in position4: ? ? R A ?  \nPossible: BAR_? But B-A-R? A in position2? Disallowed?  \nCAR_? C-A-R? A in position2? Disallowed?  \n\nBut position1 and position2 should not have A?  \nSo for ? ? R A ?:  \nPosition1: not A  \nPosition2: not A  \nPosition3: R  \nPosition4: A  \nPosition5: ?\n\nSo e.g., TURFA? U, F? Not common?  \nPUREA? P-U-R-E-A? E excluded?  \n\n""LARVA"": L-A-R-V-A?

A in position5?  \nPositions: 1:B,2:U,3:R,4:K,5:A  \nThen A is in position5? This is for R in position3 and A in position5.  \n\nBURKA is a word? Yes, a type of garment.\n\nSo BURKA: B,U,R,K,A\n\nBut what about position2? It\'s U? We haven\'t tested U? \n\nAlso, we must avoid O,E,I,S,N,D? U is not excluded? So BURKA is possible? \n\nBut let\'s confirm: R in position3?  \nA in position5?  \nPosition2: U? Also, B and K new? \n\nNow, valid? \n\nSimilarly, ""HURRA"" not a word?  \n""JUROR"" O excluded?  \n\nAnother: ""PURRA"" not word?  \n\nSince R in position3 is fixed, and A in position5? Then other positions: any of the letters not excluded? \n\nPerhaps ""CURTA"" not word?  \n\nBack to R in position2? Which seems easier? \n\nIf R in position2 and A in position5: ? R ? A ?  \nThen positions 1,3,4 need to be filled with letters not excluded?  \n\nFor example: CRAFT? C-R-A-F-T? But A here is in position3?  \nIf A in position5: then ? R ? ? A?  \nExample: TRUFA? Not word?  \nBRUSH? U,S excluded?  \nFRUIT? I excluded?  \nCRAWL? C-R-A-W-L? A in position3? For A in position5: ? R ? ? A  \nLike ""BARRA"" not?  \n""FERRA"" E excluded?  \n\n""WORMA"" O and A?

But we can\'t assume?  \n\nGiven the difficulty, let\'s list words that include R and A, exclude E,I,S,D,O,N, and have positions where R is not in 1 or 4, A not in 1 or 2? And letters from B,C,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? And valid English.\n\nPossible word: ""TRAMP""\n- T-R-A-M-P\n- Positions: R in position2 (allowed)\n- A in position3 ( allowed? Yes? Because not position2)\n- But does it violate? R in position2: allowed A in position3: allowed\n- Also, no excluded letters? T, M, P: not in absent list.\n\n""TRAMP"": T,R,A,M,P\nFeedback: T,R,A,M,P? Exclude E,I,S,D,O,N? Yes.\n\nBut is TRAMP a word? Yes.\n\nAnother: ""TRAWL"" T,R,A,W,L\n- R in position2, A in position3? But position3 for A? Is this allowed? Yes, A is not forbidden in position3? Only positions 1 and 2 are forbidden? So in TRAMP and TRAWL, A is in position3? That\'s fine.\n\nWe can also try ""GRAPH""? G-R-A-P-H? A in position3? Yes.\nBut G,R,A,P,H? H? P? G? All allowed.\n\nBut TRAWL has W and L? Which are common? TRAMP has M and P? \n\nPerhaps TRAMP is better? Or whatever.\n\nBut also, we must include R and A? Both have them.\n\nNow, comparing to ADORN and RAISE, TRAWL or TRAMP?\n\nIn TRAWL: positions 1:T, 2:R, 3:A, 4:W,5:L? \nR in position2: we haven\'t tested position2? So this will tell us if position2 is correct? If it is, we get R(✓)? If not, R(-)? \nSimilarly, A in position3: new position? \nAnd T,W,L tested.\n\nSimilarly for TRAMP.\n\nBut note in TRAMP: position4 is M and position5 is P? \nBoth have T in position1? \n\nGiven that, I think TRAWL is a valid choice? Or TRAMP?\n\nAnother: ""CRAWL"" C-R-A-W-L? Position1:C, not tested? Better than T? But T is common? \n\nIn the first guess RAISE, T wasn\'t used? So introducing T is good.\n\nSo TRAMP: T,R,A,M,P\n\nor TRAWL: T,R,A,W,L\n\nBoth good? \n\nI\'ll pick ""TRAMP"" because it tests M and P, which are common.\n\nBut to maximize, perhaps TRAMP? \n\nBut let me see if there\'s a word with R in position3 or5? \n\nWith R in position3 and A in position4: We had trouble? But BURKA with A in position5? \nBURKA: B,U,R,K,A \n- Positions: 1:B,2:U,3:R,4:K,5:A? \nThis places R in position3 (new) and A in position5 (new) \nAnd tests B,U,K. \n\nU is vowel? And B,K are not as common? But BURKA is a valid word? \n\nCompared to TRAMP: T common, R in2, A in3? \n\nPerhaps TRAMP is more standard? \n\nGiven the time, I\'ll go with TRAMP.\n\nBut in TRAMP, is position for A: position3? We know from previous that A is in the word, not in pos2? So pos3 is untested?  \n\nThe secret word could have A in pos3? Or not? \n\nSo I guess ""TRAMP"" . \n\n<guess>TRAMP</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\nBased on the feedback:\n- **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: R and A are in the word but not in positions 1 or 2. I, S, and E are absent.\n- **Guess 2 (ADORN)**: A and R are in the word but not in positions 1 or 4. D, O, and N are absent.\n  \n**Key insights**:\n- **Confirmed letters**: R and A must appear in the new guess.\n- **Absent letters**: I, S, E, D, O, N cannot be used.\n- **Position constraints**:\n  - R cannot be in positions 1 or 4 (from Guess 1 and Guess 2).\n  - A cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (from Guess 1 and Guess 2).\n- **Possible positions**:\n  - R: Positions 2, 3, or 5.\n- A: Positions 3, 4, or 5.\n- **Available letters**: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (since E, I, S, D, O, N are excluded).\n\n**Strategy**:  \n- Prioritize words with R and A in allowed positions while introducing new common letters (e.g., T, L, M, P) to maximize information.\n- R in position 2 and A in position 3 are plausible focus areas, as these positions are untested and common in English words.\n- Avoid repeating letters for efficiency.\n\n**Selected word: ""TRAMP""**  \n- **Structure**: T-R-A-M-P\n  - Position 1: T (new letter, untested)\n  - Position 2: R (allowed; not position 1 or 4)\n  - Position 3: A (allowed; not position 1 or 2)\n  - Position 4: M (new letter)\n  - Position 5: P (new letter)\n- **Why TRAMP?**:\n  - Tests R and A in new positions (R in pos 2, A in pos 3).\n  - Introduces T, M, P—high-frequency consonants.\n  - Avoids constraints and absent letters.\n  - Balanced mix of common letters; valid 5-letter word with no duplicates.\n\nThis guess will clarify:\n- If R is in position 2 (✓ or -).\n- If A is in position 3 (✓ or -).\n- Presence/absence of T, M, P.\n\n<guess>TRAMP</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ADORN -> FEEDBACK: A(-) D(x) O(x) R(-) N(x)\nGuess 3: TRAMP -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) A(-) M(-) P(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

**Guess 1: RAISE**
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 1.
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 2.
- I(x), S(x), E(x): I, S, E are not in the word.

**Guess 2: ADORN**
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- D(x), O(x), N(x): D, O, N are not in the word.
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 4.

**Guess 3: TRAMP**
- T(x): T is not in the word.
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 2 (since in TRAMP, R is at position 2).
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 3 (since in TRAMP, A is at position 3).
- M(-): M is in the word but not in position 4 (TRAMP position 4 is M).
- P(x): P is not in the word.

**Summary of Known Information**:
- **Present letters**: R, A, M (each confirmed with '-' feedback in multiple guesses).
- **Absent letters**: I, S, E, D, O, N, T, P (all marked 'x').
- **Position constraints for present letters**:
  - R: Cannot be in positions 1 (from RAISE), 4 (from ADORN), or 2 (from TRAMP). So R must be in position 3 or 5.
  - A: Cannot be in positions 1 (from ADORN), 2 (from RAISE), or 3 (from TRAMP). So A must be in position 4 or 5.
  - M: Cannot be in position 4 (from TRAMP). Since it's present, it must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but positions must respect other constraints).
- **Remaining positions**: The secret word has positions 1-5 with R in 3 or 5, A in 4 or 5, and M somewhere else.

**Analysis**:
- Since R and A both might be in position 5, we need to consider if they occupy the same position or not. However, a letter can appear only once (unless duplicated, but no feedback suggests duplicates yet). Since all previous guesses had distinct letters and feedback didn't show duplicates, we assume distinct letters for now.
- Position 5 cannot have both R and A. Therefore:
  - Scenario A: R in position 3 -> then A must be in position 4 or 5 (not position 3).
  - Scenario B: R in position 5 -> then A must be in position 4 (since position 5 is taken).

Also, M is present and must be placed in a position not yet tried? But we don't have feedback on M being in specific positions except that it's not in position 4? So M can be in positions 1,2,3,5? But must not conflict with R and A.

Moreover, we have two other letters to fill, but we don't know what they are? We must test new letters.

Available letters exclude known absent (I,S,E,D,O,N,T,P) and the confirmed present? But the present letters R,A,M must be included? So the word should have exactly these three plus two new letters.

Available alphabet remaining: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? Common ones: B,C,F,G,H,K,L,U,V,W.

**Strategy**: Ensure the word includes R, A, M in the allowed positions and tests two new common letters.

Consider scenarios:

**Scenario A: R in position 3**
- Positions: ? ? R ? ?
- A: position 4 or 5
- M: position not 4 (and must be placed in an available position: 1,2,5? or wherever except position4)

Example with A in position4: ? ? R A ?
Then M must be in position 1, 2, or 5? But if A in position4, position5 is free? So M could be in 1,2,5? But we want to avoid known bad positions? None yet except for M.

So structure: Position1: ?, Position2: ?, Position3: R, Position4: A, Position5: ?

But M must be in the word? So M could be in position1,2, or5.

Possible words: 
- With M in position1: M ? R A ? -> e.g., ""MURAY""? Not a common word? 
- Better: ""MURAL""? But L is allowed? Letters: M,U,R,A,L? 
  Positions: M,U,R,A,L -> Position3:R? Position4:A? Yes? 
  And U and L are new? 
  But ""MURAL"" valid? Yes? 
  However, is L allowed? L not absent? And U not absent? 

Now, for position2: U? We haven't tested U before? 
Positions: 1:M, 2:U, 3:R, 4:A, 5:L? 
But A is in position4? Is that allowed? From the constraints, A can be in position4? Yes? 
But in ADORN, A was in position1? And in TRAMP, A was in position3? We don't have feedback on position4? So yes? 
Also R is in position3: we had R not in positions 1,4,2? But position3? We don't know? 

But what about MURAL? It includes M,U,R,A,L? All distinct? 

Alternatively, with A in position5? For Scenario A? 
Then positions: ? ? R ? A 
Then M could be in position1,2, or4? 

Example: "" ? ? R M A"" -> e.g., ""BERMA"" not common? Or ""FERMA"" not? 
""CURMA""? Not valid? 
""ARMOR"" but O excluded? 

Hard to find words.

**Scenario B: R in position5?**
- Positions: ? ? ? ? R
- A must be in position4? (since A cannot overlap R at position5? So A in position4? 
- Then positions: ? ? ? A R
- Now we must place R? At position5? But R is in position5? We haven't tested that? 
- And A at position4? 
- Then M can be in position1,2,3? Because position4 is taken by A? 

Structure: Position1: ?, Position2: ?, Position3: ?, Position4: A, Position5: R? 
And M must be in position1,2, or3? 

Possible words: 
- M in position1: M ? ? A R? E.g., ""MAGAR"" not word? 
- M in position2: ? M ? A R? ""UMAKR"" not? 
- M in position3: ? ? M A R? 

Now, words with ending ""...MAR"": 
Common: ""VIMAR""? Not? ""GAMAR"" not? ""LAMAR""? Yes, as in the surname? But valid? 
""LAMAR"": L-A-M-A-R? But A at position2? Which is disallowed? 
Positions: L in1? A in2? But A cannot be in position2? 

Therefore, avoid A in position2? So for this structure: the third position is M? So ? ? M A R? 
Example: ""CALMAR""? Six letters? 
Five: ""WOMAR""? O excluded? 
"" HUMAR""? U? 
""DEMAR""? D excluded? E? 
""BOMAR""? O? 
""KUMAR""? K,U? 
KUMAR: K-U-M-A-R? 
Positions: 1:K,2:U,3:M,4:A,5:R? 
Here: 
- Position4: A? Allowed? 
- Position5: R? Allowed? 
- Position3: M? We don't have constraint for M position? 
Also, letters K,U,M,A,R? M,A,R present? K,U new? 

KUMAR is a valid word? Yes? 

But K? U? Not extremely common? 

Another: ""GUMAR""? Not common? 
""NUMAR""? N excluded? 
So ""KUMAR"" might work? 

Comparing scenarios:
With Scenario A: R in position3: MURAL is possible? 
With Scenario B: R in position5: KUMAR? 

Now, MURAL:
- Letters: M,U,R,A,L? R,A,M present? Test U and L?
- Positions: R at3, A at4? 
But from feedback, are these positions allowed? 

Similarly, KUMAR: R at5, A at4? M at3? 

But MURAL: M position1? A position4? 
KUMAR: M position3? 

Which to choose? 

We also need to consider commonality? But both are valid words? 

Moreover, from TRAMP feedback, M is not in position4? But we don't know other positions? 

Maybe we can choose a word that tests both possibilities? 

But with only one guess? We must select one? 

Another option for Scenario A? With R in pos3 and A in pos5: 
? ? R ? A 
And M somewhere? 
Possible: ""HAIRM"" not? 

Given time, I select ""MURAL"" for Scenario A? 

But let's confirm the constraints:

In MURAL: 
- Position1: M -> M is present? And we haven't tested position1? 
- Position2: U -> new letter? 
- Position3: R -> R in position3? Allowed? We don't know? 
- Position4: A -> A in position4? Allowed? 
- Position5: L -> new letter? 
Also, absent letters I,S,E,D,O,N,T,P excluded? Yes? 

Similarly, KUMAR: Position1:K,2:M? Wait, in KUMAR, position2:U, position3:M,4:A,5:R? 
But M is in position3? Is M allowed there? We have no constraint? 

But in TRAMP, M was at position4? But in TRAMP, position4 was M and marked as present but wrong position? So we know M is not at position4? That doesn't restrict position3? 

So both are possible? 

However, we also need to think about which scenario is more likely? 

With three guesses, we have limited remaining tries? 

But maybe a word that works for both? Not really? 

Alternatively, a different word for Scenario B? 

Another word: for ? ? M A R: ""FUMAR""? But not English? 
""RAM"" is too short? 

Perhaps ""LUMAR""? L-U-M-A-R? 
But LUMAR? Not common? 

I think ""KUMAR"" or ""MURAL"" are options? 

But let's prioritize common words: 

MURAL is known? So I'll guess ""MURAL"" for now? 

But wait: in Scenario A? 

We have R in position3 and A in position4? 

Now, note that MURAL places M in position1? But is M allowed in position1? No constraint? 

But also, U and L are tested? 

Similarly, KUMAR tests K and U? 

Another common word: ""CRAWL"" was considered earlier, but now? With constraints? We know T,P? But ""CRAWL"" would have C,R,A,W,L? 
But A is in position3? We now know A is not in position3? So that would be invalid? 

Thus, avoid any position that has been marked as wrong? 

For A: wrong positions: 1,2,3? So A can only be position4 or5? 
Similarly for R: positions 1,2,4? So R only position3 or5? 
M: position4? M cannot be in position4? So M:1,2,3,5? 

In MURAL: M at1 (new), A at4 (allowed), R at3 (allowed)? 

Good.

Similarly, KUMAR: M at3? If R at5? Then K,U,M,A,R? M at position3? 

But in KUMAR, why not?

But MURAL includes L? Which might be more common? 

So I'll go with ""MURAL""

Guessed word: ""MURAL""Consider the Feedback Constraints:
- R must be in position 3 or 5.
- A must be in position 4 or 5.
- M must not be in position 4.
- The word must include R, A, M and exclude I,S,E,D,O,N,T,P.
- Letters available: B,C,F,G,H,J,K,L,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Develop Candidate Words:
We need to cover R, A, M in valid positions and introduce new letters.  
Strong candidate: **""MURAL""**  
- Letters: M, U, R, A, L  
- Positions:  
  1: M (allowed; M not forbidden in position 1)  
  2: U (new letter)  
  3: R (allowed position)  
  4: A (allowed position)  
  5: L (new letter)  
- Uses common potential letters U and L.  
- Conforms: No duplicate or forbidden letters; valid 5-letter word.  

Alternative candidate ""KUMAR"" was considered but ""MURAL"" is more common and better aligns with position distributions by placing R in position 3 and A in position 4? This tests two viable configurations simultaneously.

<guess>MURAL</guess>
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

After reviewing all feedback:
- **Confirmed present letters**: R, A, M (all gave ""-"" or equivalent feedback, indicating they are in the word but not in guessed positions).
- **Confirmed absent letters**: I, S, E, D, O, N, T, P (all gave ""x"", so excluded).
- **Position constraints**:
  - R cannot be in:
    - Position 1 (from RAISE feedback: R not in 1),
    - Position 4 (from ADORN feedback: R not in 4),
    - Position 2 (from TRAMP feedback: R not in 2).
    - So R must be in **position 3 or 5**.
  - A cannot be in:
    - Position 2 (from RAISE: A not in 2),
    - Position 1 (from ADORN: A not in 1),
    - Position 3 (from TRAMP: A not in 3).
    - So A must be in **position 4 or 5**.
  - M cannot be in position 4 (from TRAMP: M not in 4). So M must be in positions 1, 2, or 5.
- **Available letters**: Must use R, A, M in valid positions and introduce two new letters from remaining alphabet (excluding absent letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).
- **Word structure**: R and A compete for position 5? Since both cannot occupy the same position if unique. Need to cover:
  - If R is in position 3, A must be in position 4 or 5? Position 5 possible.
  - If R is in position 5, A must be in position 4.

**Chosen approach**: Prioritize a word with R in position 3 and A in position 4. This resolves the overlap conflict and allows testing M in a new position.
- Selected word: **""MURAL""**
  - Valid positions:
    - Position 3: R (allowed? Position 3 is untested).
    - Position 4: A (allowed? Position 4 is untested).
    - Position 1: M (allowed? M can be in position 1).
    - Positions 2 and 5: Test new letters U and L.
  - Letters covered: M (present), U (new), R (present), A (present), L (new). Avoids all absent letters.
  - Maximizes information: Tests high-frequency letters U and L, and resolves R/A positions efficiently.
- **Why not other options?**  
  - Alternatives like ""KUMAR"" (R in 5, A in 4, M in 3) were considered, but ""MURAL"" is more common and better fits the constraints without position conflicts.

<guess>MURAL</guess>",MURAL,"We have feedback from three guesses:

**Guess 1: RAISE**
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 1.
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 2.
- I(x), S(x), E(x): I, S, E are not in the word.

**Guess 2: ADORN**
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- D(x), O(x), N(x): D, O, N are not in the word.
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 4.

**Guess 3: TRAMP**
- T(x): T is not in the word.
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 2 (since in TRAMP, R is at position 2).
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 3 (since in TRAMP, A is at position 3).
- M(-): M is in the word but not in position 4 (TRAMP position 4 is M).
- P(x): P is not in the word.

**Summary of Known Information**:
- **Present letters**: R, A, M (each confirmed with '-' feedback in multiple guesses).
- **Absent letters**: I, S, E, D, O, N, T, P (all marked 'x').
- **Position constraints for present letters**:
  - R: Cannot be in positions 1 (from RAISE), 4 (from ADORN), or 2 (from TRAMP). So R must be in position 3 or 5.
  - A: Cannot be in positions 1 (from ADORN), 2 (from RAISE), or 3 (from TRAMP). So A must be in position 4 or 5.
  - M: Cannot be in position 4 (from TRAMP). Since it's present, it must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but positions must respect other constraints).
- **Remaining positions**: The secret word has positions 1-5 with R in 3 or 5, A in 4 or 5, and M somewhere else.

**Analysis**:
- Since R and A both might be in position 5, we need to consider if they occupy the same position or not. However, a letter can appear only once (unless duplicated, but no feedback suggests duplicates yet). Since all previous guesses had distinct letters and feedback didn't show duplicates, we assume distinct letters for now.
- Position 5 cannot have both R and A. Therefore:
  - Scenario A: R in position 3 -> then A must be in position 4 or 5 (not position 3).
  - Scenario B: R in position 5 -> then A must be in position 4 (since position 5 is taken).

Also, M is present and must be placed in a position not yet tried? But we don't have feedback on M being in specific positions except that it's not in position 4? So M can be in positions 1,2,3,5? But must not conflict with R and A.

Moreover, we have two other letters to fill, but we don't know what they are? We must test new letters.

Available letters exclude known absent (I,S,E,D,O,N,T,P) and the confirmed present? But the present letters R,A,M must be included? So the word should have exactly these three plus two new letters.

Available alphabet remaining: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? Common ones: B,C,F,G,H,K,L,U,V,W.

**Strategy**: Ensure the word includes R, A, M in the allowed positions and tests two new common letters.

Consider scenarios:

**Scenario A: R in position 3**
- Positions: ? ? R ? ?
- A: position 4 or 5
- M: position not 4 (and must be placed in an available position: 1,2,5? or wherever except position4)

Example with A in position4: ? ? R A ?
Then M must be in position 1, 2, or 5? But if A in position4, position5 is free? So M could be in 1,2,5? But we want to avoid known bad positions? None yet except for M.

So structure: Position1: ?, Position2: ?, Position3: R, Position4: A, Position5: ?

But M must be in the word? So M could be in position1,2, or5.

Possible words: 
- With M in position1: M ? R A ? -> e.g., ""MURAY""? Not a common word? 
- Better: ""MURAL""? But L is allowed? Letters: M,U,R,A,L? 
  Positions: M,U,R,A,L -> Position3:R? Position4:A? Yes? 
  And U and L are new? 
  But ""MURAL"" valid? Yes? 
  However, is L allowed? L not absent? And U not absent? 

Now, for position2: U? We haven't tested U before? 
Positions: 1:M, 2:U, 3:R, 4:A, 5:L? 
But A is in position4? Is that allowed? From the constraints, A can be in position4? Yes? 
But in ADORN, A was in position1? And in TRAMP, A was in position3? We don't have feedback on position4? So yes? 
Also R is in position3: we had R not in positions 1,4,2? But position3? We don't know? 

But what about MURAL? It includes M,U,R,A,L? All distinct? 

Alternatively, with A in position5? For Scenario A? 
Then positions: ? ? R ? A 
Then M could be in position1,2, or4? 

Example: "" ? ? R M A"" -> e.g., ""BERMA"" not common? Or ""FERMA"" not? 
""CURMA""? Not valid? 
""ARMOR"" but O excluded? 

Hard to find words.

**Scenario B: R in position5?**
- Positions: ? ? ? ? R
- A must be in position4? (since A cannot overlap R at position5? So A in position4? 
- Then positions: ? ? ? A R
- Now we must place R? At position5? But R is in position5? We haven't tested that? 
- And A at position4? 
- Then M can be in position1,2,3? Because position4 is taken by A? 

Structure: Position1: ?, Position2: ?, Position3: ?, Position4: A, Position5: R? 
And M must be in position1,2, or3? 

Possible words: 
- M in position1: M ? ? A R? E.g., ""MAGAR"" not word? 
- M in position2: ? M ? A R? ""UMAKR"" not? 
- M in position3: ? ? M A R? 

Now, words with ending ""...MAR"": 
Common: ""VIMAR""? Not? ""GAMAR"" not? ""LAMAR""? Yes, as in the surname? But valid? 
""LAMAR"": L-A-M-A-R? But A at position2? Which is disallowed? 
Positions: L in1? A in2? But A cannot be in position2? 

Therefore, avoid A in position2? So for this structure: the third position is M? So ? ? M A R? 
Example: ""CALMAR""? Six letters? 
Five: ""WOMAR""? O excluded? 
"" HUMAR""? U? 
""DEMAR""? D excluded? E? 
""BOMAR""? O? 
""KUMAR""? K,U? 
KUMAR: K-U-M-A-R? 
Positions: 1:K,2:U,3:M,4:A,5:R? 
Here: 
- Position4: A? Allowed? 
- Position5: R? Allowed? 
- Position3: M? We don't have constraint for M position? 
Also, letters K,U,M,A,R? M,A,R present? K,U new? 

KUMAR is a valid word? Yes? 

But K? U? Not extremely common? 

Another: ""GUMAR""? Not common? 
""NUMAR""? N excluded? 
So ""KUMAR"" might work? 

Comparing scenarios:
With Scenario A: R in position3: MURAL is possible? 
With Scenario B: R in position5: KUMAR? 

Now, MURAL:
- Letters: M,U,R,A,L? R,A,M present? Test U and L?
- Positions: R at3, A at4? 
But from feedback, are these positions allowed? 

Similarly, KUMAR: R at5, A at4? M at3? 

But MURAL: M position1? A position4? 
KUMAR: M position3? 

Which to choose? 

We also need to consider commonality? But both are valid words? 

Moreover, from TRAMP feedback, M is not in position4? But we don't know other positions? 

Maybe we can choose a word that tests both possibilities? 

But with only one guess? We must select one? 

Another option for Scenario A? With R in pos3 and A in pos5: 
? ? R ? A 
And M somewhere? 
Possible: ""HAIRM"" not? 

Given time, I select ""MURAL"" for Scenario A? 

But let's confirm the constraints:

In MURAL: 
- Position1: M -> M is present? And we haven't tested position1? 
- Position2: U -> new letter? 
- Position3: R -> R in position3? Allowed? We don't know? 
- Position4: A -> A in position4? Allowed? 
- Position5: L -> new letter? 
Also, absent letters I,S,E,D,O,N,T,P excluded? Yes? 

Similarly, KUMAR: Position1:K,2:M? Wait, in KUMAR, position2:U, position3:M,4:A,5:R? 
But M is in position3? Is M allowed there? We have no constraint? 

But in TRAMP, M was at position4? But in TRAMP, position4 was M and marked as present but wrong position? So we know M is not at position4? That doesn't restrict position3? 

So both are possible? 

However, we also need to think about which scenario is more likely? 

With three guesses, we have limited remaining tries? 

But maybe a word that works for both? Not really? 

Alternatively, a different word for Scenario B? 

Another word: for ? ? M A R: ""FUMAR""? But not English? 
""RAM"" is too short? 

Perhaps ""LUMAR""? L-U-M-A-R? 
But LUMAR? Not common? 

I think ""KUMAR"" or ""MURAL"" are options? 

But let's prioritize common words: 

MURAL is known? So I'll guess ""MURAL"" for now? 

But wait: in Scenario A? 

We have R in position3 and A in position4? 

Now, note that MURAL places M in position1? But is M allowed in position1? No constraint? 

But also, U and L are tested? 

Similarly, KUMAR tests K and U? 

Another common word: ""CRAWL"" was considered earlier, but now? With constraints? We know T,P? But ""CRAWL"" would have C,R,A,W,L? 
But A is in position3? We now know A is not in position3? So that would be invalid? 

Thus, avoid any position that has been marked as wrong? 

For A: wrong positions: 1,2,3? So A can only be position4 or5? 
Similarly for R: positions 1,2,4? So R only position3 or5? 
M: position4? M cannot be in position4? So M:1,2,3,5? 

In MURAL: M at1 (new), A at4 (allowed), R at3 (allowed)? 

Good.

Similarly, KUMAR: M at3? If R at5? Then K,U,M,A,R? M at position3? 

But in KUMAR, why not?

But MURAL includes L? Which might be more common? 

So I'll go with ""MURAL""

Guessed word: ""MURAL""Consider the Feedback Constraints:
- R must be in position 3 or 5.
- A must be in position 4 or 5.
- M must not be in position 4.
- The word must include R, A, M and exclude I,S,E,D,O,N,T,P.
- Letters available: B,C,F,G,H,J,K,L,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Develop Candidate Words:
We need to cover R, A, M in valid positions and introduce new letters.  
Strong candidate: **""MURAL""**  
- Letters: M, U, R, A, L  
- Positions:  
  1: M (allowed; M not forbidden in position 1)  
  2: U (new letter)  
  3: R (allowed position)  
  4: A (allowed position)  
  5: L (new letter)  
- Uses common potential letters U and L.  
- Conforms: No duplicate or forbidden letters; valid 5-letter word.  

Alternative candidate ""KUMAR"" was considered but ""MURAL"" is more common and better aligns with position distributions by placing R in position 3 and A in position 4? This tests two viable configurations simultaneously.

<guess>MURAL</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

After reviewing all feedback:
- **Confirmed present letters**: R, A, M (all gave ""-"" or equivalent feedback, indicating they are in the word but not in guessed positions).
- **Confirmed absent letters**: I, S, E, D, O, N, T, P (all gave ""x"", so excluded).
- **Position constraints**:
  - R cannot be in:
    - Position 1 (from RAISE feedback: R not in 1),
    - Position 4 (from ADORN feedback: R not in 4),
    - Position 2 (from TRAMP feedback: R not in 2).
    - So R must be in **position 3 or 5**.
  - A cannot be in:
    - Position 2 (from RAISE: A not in 2),
    - Position 1 (from ADORN: A not in 1),
    - Position 3 (from TRAMP: A not in 3).
    - So A must be in **position 4 or 5**.
  - M cannot be in position 4 (from TRAMP: M not in 4). So M must be in positions 1, 2, or 5.
- **Available letters**: Must use R, A, M in valid positions and introduce two new letters from remaining alphabet (excluding absent letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).
- **Word structure**: R and A compete for position 5? Since both cannot occupy the same position if unique. Need to cover:
  - If R is in position 3, A must be in position 4 or 5? Position 5 possible.
  - If R is in position 5, A must be in position 4.

**Chosen approach**: Prioritize a word with R in position 3 and A in position 4. This resolves the overlap conflict and allows testing M in a new position.
- Selected word: **""MURAL""**
  - Valid positions:
    - Position 3: R (allowed? Position 3 is untested).
    - Position 4: A (allowed? Position 4 is untested).
    - Position 1: M (allowed? M can be in position 1).
    - Positions 2 and 5: Test new letters U and L.
  - Letters covered: M (present), U (new), R (present), A (present), L (new). Avoids all absent letters.
  - Maximizes information: Tests high-frequency letters U and L, and resolves R/A positions efficiently.
- **Why not other options?**  
  - Alternatives like ""KUMAR"" (R in 5, A in 4, M in 3) were considered, but ""MURAL"" is more common and better fits the constraints without position conflicts.",Guess 4: MURAL -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) U(✓) R(✓) A(✓) L(✓),SUCCESS
