We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane""
 Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)

 Interpretation:
 - C is not in the secret word (x)
 - R is in the secret word but not in the second position (-)
 - A is not in the secret word (x)
 - N is not in the secret word (x)
 - E is in the secret word but not in the fifth position (-)

 Therefore, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions we guessed (so R is not at position 2, E is not at position 5).
 - The secret word does not contain C, A, or N.

 Since R is in the word but not at position 2, and E is in the word but not at position 5, we need to form a new guess that includes R and E, and excludes C, A, N.

 We should also note that the secret word is 5 letters long.

 For our next guess, we want to try to place R and E in different positions and include other common letters that we haven't tested yet. We avoid using C, A, N.

 Let's think of common letters that can be used. We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We need to form a 5-letter word that has R and E, and avoids C, A, N.

 Also note that in the word ""crane"", the positions were:
 1: C (x)
 2: R (but R is in the word, just not here) -> so R must be in one of the positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? Actually, the feedback only says it's not at position 2. But note, we have a '-' for R at position 2 meaning it is elsewhere.

 Similarly, E is in the word but not at position 5, so E must be at one of the positions 1,2,3,4.

 However, we must also consider that we cannot put R and E in the same positions we already tried? Actually, we can put them in any position except the ones we know they are not. But note: we don't know where they are exactly.

 So, let's choose a word that has:
 - R in a position that is not 2, and E in a position that is not 5.

 Since we have two letters that are confirmed (R and E), we want to maximize information on the other letters.

 Possible words: We can consider words like ""TRIBE"", ""DRIVE"", ""STORE"", etc. But we have to avoid using C, A, N.

 Let me think of words that have R and E and no C, A, N.

 Another idea: We know R is in the word but not at position 2. We can try to put R in position 1? Then E in a different position? Also, we can test more vowels and common consonants.

 One good candidate is ""ROUTE"": 
   R in position 1 (which is a new position for R) 
   E in position 5? But wait, the feedback said E is not in position 5? Actually, we must avoid putting E at position 5 because we know it's not there.

 So let's put E in a position between 1 and 4.

 Alternatively, let me pick a word that places R and E in new positions and uses other common letters.

 Suggestion: ""STRETCH"" is 7 letters, too long. We need 5 letters.

 How about ""STORE"": 
   S, T, O, R, E.
   But note: in ""STORE"", R is in position 4 and E is in position 5. However, we are not allowed to put E at position 5? The feedback from ""crane"" said E is not at position 5? Actually, the feedback was for the fifth letter (E) of ""crane"" being not correct. But it does not mean that E cannot be at position 5? Wait, no: the feedback says the letter E is present in the word but not at that position. So if we put E at position 5 in ""STORE"", it might be that in the secret word E is at position 5? But wait, we know from the first guess that E is not at position 5? Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" says that E is in the word but not at position 5. Therefore, we know that E is in the secret word somewhere else, so if we put E at position 5 now, it must be incorrect? Actually, no: the feedback only told us that in the word ""crane"", the E at position 5 was not the right position. It doesn't forbid E from being at position 5? Well, if the secret word had E at position 5, then when we guessed ""crane"", which has E at position 5, we would have gotten a ✓ for E. But we got a '-' meaning it is present but not at that position. Therefore, we can deduce that E is definitely not at position 5? So we should avoid placing E at position 5 in our new guess? Actually, we can try to put E in a different position to get more information.

 So for ""STORE"":
   Positions: 
      1: S
      2: T
      3: O
      4: R
      5: E   -> but we know E is not at position 5? So this would be incorrect? Actually, we can avoid position 5 for E.

 So let me choose a word with E at positions 1-4.

 Another word: ""TRIED"" -> has E in position 5? No: T, R, I, E, D -> E is at position 4? Actually, ""TRIED"" is T-R-I-E-D: position 1: T, 2: R, 3: I, 4: E, 5: D. 
   But we have R at position 2? And in the first guess we had R at position 2 and it was present but in the wrong position? So wait: the secret word has R but not at position 2. Does that mean R must be in one of the other positions? But when we put R at position 2 again, we would expect a '-' again? Maybe we can use that to see if R is at position 2? But no: we know it's not at position 2? Actually, the feedback told us that R is not at position 2. So if we put R at position 2 again, we would get a '-' again? But we don't learn anything new by putting R in the same wrong position? Moreover, we already know R is in the word, so putting it at position 2 again would only confirm it's still not placed correctly? But we want to try to put R in a different position to hit the correct one.

 So ideally, let's place R in a position that we haven't tried. We have only tried position 2 for R. So we can try R at positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Similarly, we have only tried E at position 5? So we can try E at positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 Therefore, let's choose a word that has R at a position other than 2, and E at a position other than 5.

 Example: ""DRIVE"": 
   D, R, I, V, E
   R is at position 2? Then we would get a '-' for R again? But we want to try a different position for R? So avoid position 2.

 How about ""RODEO""? No, it has E? Actually, no: R, O, D, E, O -> yes, E at position 4.

 But ""RODEO"": 
   R at position 1 -> new position for R? 
   O? 
   D? 
   E at position 4? 
   O? 

 But ""RODEO"" has two O's? And we don't know if the secret word has O? But we can test O and D.

 However, let me think: we haven't been given any information about O and D so they are allowed? And we know we must use R and E and avoid C, A, N.

 So ""RODEO"" is a valid word? But note: the secret word might contain duplicate letters? But in this case, we don't know.

 Alternatively, let's choose a word without duplicate letters? We can get more information.

 Also, let me consider that we have two letters to include: R and E. We need three more.

 Let me try ""RESTY"": 
   R at position 1 (new position), E at position 2 (which hasn't been tried for E because we've only tried E at position 5). 
   S, T, Y? 

 But note: E is at position 2? And we don't know if E can be there? 

 Steps:

 We want to plan:
   Position for R: avoid 2 -> try 1, 3, 4, 5.
   Position for E: avoid 5 -> try 1, 2, 3, 4.

 Also, we want to test as many new letters as possible? Because we have only ruled out C, A, N.

 Let me choose a word that includes common letters: S, T, etc.

 Another candidate: ""RIPES"": 
   R at 1, I, P, E, S? Then E at position 4? S at 5? 

 But ""RIPES"" is a word? Yes.

 However, note that we have two known letters: we are including R and E, and the rest are new (I, P, S).

 How about ""STERN"": 
   S, T, E, R, N? But N is disallowed? We know N is not in the word? We cannot use N.

 So let's avoid forbidden letters: C, A, N? Forbidden letters: C, A, N.

 Therefore, any word that includes C, A, or N is invalid? We should not guess a word with these letters because we know they are not in the secret word.

 So ""STERN"" has N -> invalid.

 Words without C, A, N and that have R and E? And don't put R at position 2? And don't put E at position 5?

 Let me think of common words: 
   ""SERIF"": 
      S, E, R, I, F -> 
        E at position 2? 
        R at position 3? 
        This avoids putting R at position 2 and E at position 5? 
        Positions: 
          1: S
          2: E -> we haven't tried E at position 2? 
          3: R -> we haven't tried R at position 3? 
          4: I
          5: F

   This seems good? 

 Another: ""RESIN"": cannot because it has N? Disallowed.

 Another: ""MERIT"": M, E, R, I, T -> E at 2? R at 3? 

 But we also haven't tested M, I, T? So yes.

 However, note: in ""MERIT"", E is at position 2 and R at position 3? 

 Alternatively, what about ""BEARD"": B, E, A, R, D? But A is disallowed? Cannot use A.

 So let me check: ""TERSE"" -> 
   T, E, R, S, E -> duplicates? 
   But it has E at position 2 and 5? And we know E is not at position 5? So we avoid putting E at 5? 
   But here at position 5: E? So we shouldn't? Actually, we must avoid position 5 for E? But we can test? However, it would likely be inefficient.

 So I prefer ""MERIT"". 

 Steps:
   We'll guess ""MERIT"": 
        M at position 1 (new letter)
        E at position 2 (new position for E? Not position 5)
        R at position 3 (new position for R? Not position 2)
        I at position 4 (new letter)
        T at position 5 (new letter)

 Then we can get feedback on M, E, R, I, T.

 Also, note: if the secret word has E at position 2? Then we'd get a ✓? And similarly for R.

 So let me go with ""MERIT"".

 However, note: the first guess had R at position 2 and we got a '-', meaning R is in the secret word but not at position 2. Now we are putting R at position 3? Similarly, we are putting E at position 2? We don't know if E can be at position 2? It's possible? Because we only know E is not at position 5? 

 Therefore, let's proceed with ""MERIT"".

 Another candidate: ""RULES"": 
   R at position 1, U, L, E, S -> E at position 4? 
   And we avoid forbidden letters. 

 Both ""MERIT"" and ""RULES"" are good? But ""RULES"" uses U and L? Which are less common? Maybe? 

 But ""RULES"" also tests U and L? We don't know? So both are valid.

 However, let me choose ""MERIT"" because it includes T, which is a very common letter? And M, I? 

 So guess ""MERIT"".

 Therefore, my next guess is ""merit"".

<guess>merit</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- C, A, N are **not** in the secret word (all marked ""x"").  
- R is in the word but **not in position 2** (marked ""-"").  
- E is in the word but **not in position 5** (marked ""-"").  

Since R and E are confirmed present, the next guess must:  
1. Include R and E.  
2. Avoid C, A, N.  
3. Place R in a new position (not 2).  
4. Place E in a new position (not 5).  

The word ""merit"" meets these criteria:  
- Positions R (3rd) and E (2nd) differ from the first guess.  
- Tests new common letters (M, I, T) while excluding C, A, N.  

This maximizes information gain about letter placements and additional letters.  

<guess>merit</guess>",merit,"We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane""
 Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)

 Interpretation:
 - C is not in the secret word (x)
 - R is in the secret word but not in the second position (-)
 - A is not in the secret word (x)
 - N is not in the secret word (x)
 - E is in the secret word but not in the fifth position (-)

      5: E   -> but we know E is not at position 5? So this would be incorrect? Actually, we can avoid position 5 for E.

 So let me choose a word with E at positions 1-4.

 Another word: ""TRIED"" -> has E in position 5? No: T, R, I, E, D -> E is at position 4? Actually, ""TRIED"" is T-R-I-E-D: position 1: T, 2: R, 3: I, 4: E, 5: D.

 Similarly, we have only tried E at position 5? So we can try E at positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 Therefore, let's choose a word that has R at a position other than 2, and E at a position other than 5.

 Example: ""DRIVE"": 
   D, R, I, V, E
   R is at position 2? Then we would get a '-' for R again? But we want to try a different position for R? So avoid position 2.

 How about ""RODEO""? No, it has E? Actually, no: R, O, D, E, O -> yes, E at position 4.

 But ""RODEO"": 
   R at position 1 -> new position for R? 
   O? 
   D? 
   E at position 4? 
   O? 

 But ""RODEO"" has two O's? And we don't know if the secret word has O? But we can test O and D.

 However, let me think: we haven't been given any information about O and D so they are allowed? And we know we must use R and E and avoid C, A, N.

 So ""RODEO"" is a valid word? But note: the secret word might contain duplicate letters? But in this case, we don't know.

 But ""RIPES"" is a word? Yes.

 However, note that we have two known letters: we are including R and E, and the rest are new (I, P, S).

 How about ""STERN"": 
   S, T, E, R, N? But N is disallowed? We know N is not in the word? We cannot use N.

 So let's avoid forbidden letters: C, A, N? Forbidden letters: C, A, N.

 Therefore, any word that includes C, A, or N is invalid? We should not guess a word with these letters because we know they are not in the secret word.

 So ""STERN"" has N -> invalid.

 Words without C, A, N and that have R and E? And don't put R at position 2? And don't put E at position 5?

 Let me think of common words: 
   ""SERIF"": 
      S, E, R, I, F -> 
        E at position 2? 
        R at position 3? 
        This avoids putting R at position 2 and E at position 5? 
        Positions: 
          1: S
          2: E -> we haven't tried E at position 2? 
          3: R -> we haven't tried R at position 3? 
          4: I
          5: F

   This seems good? 

 Another: ""RESIN"": cannot because it has N? Disallowed.

 Another: ""MERIT"": M, E, R, I, T -> E at 2? R at 3? 

 But we also haven't tested M, I, T? So yes.

 However, note: in ""MERIT"", E is at position 2 and R at position 3? 

 Alternatively, what about ""BEARD"": B, E, A, R, D? But A is disallowed? Cannot use A.

 So let me check: ""TERSE"" -> 
   T, E, R, S, E -> duplicates? 
   But it has E at position 2 and 5? And we know E is not at position 5? So we avoid putting E at 5? 
   But here at position 5: E? So we shouldn't? Actually, we must avoid position 5 for E? But we can test? However, it would likely be inefficient.

 So I prefer ""MERIT"". 

 Steps:
   We'll guess ""MERIT"": 
        M at position 1 (new letter)
        E at position 2 (new position for E? Not position 5)
        R at position 3 (new position for R? Not position 2)
        I at position 4 (new letter)
        T at position 5 (new letter)

 Then we can get feedback on M, E, R, I, T.

 Also, note: if the secret word has E at position 2? Then we'd get a ✓? And similarly for R.

 So let me go with ""MERIT"".

 However, note: the first guess had R at position 2 and we got a '-', meaning R is in the secret word but not at position 2. Now we are putting R at position 3? Similarly, we are putting E at position 2? We don't know if E can be at position 2? It's possible? Because we only know E is not at position 5? 

 Therefore, let's proceed with ""MERIT"".

 Another candidate: ""RULES"": 
   R at position 1, U, L, E, S -> E at position 4? 
   And we avoid forbidden letters. 

 Both ""MERIT"" and ""RULES"" are good? But ""RULES"" uses U and L? Which are less common? Maybe? 

 But ""RULES"" also tests U and L? We don't know? So both are valid.

 However, let me choose ""MERIT"" because it includes T, which is a very common letter? And M, I? 

 So guess ""MERIT"".

 Therefore, my next guess is ""merit"".

<guess>merit</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- C, A, N are **not** in the secret word (all marked ""x"").  
- R is in the word but **not in position 2** (marked ""-"").  
- E is in the word but **not in position 5** (marked ""-"").  

Since R and E are confirmed present, the next guess must:  
1. Include R and E.  
2. Avoid C, A, N.  
3. Place R in a new position (not 2).  
4. Place E in a new position (not 5).  

The word ""merit"" meets these criteria:  
- Positions R (3rd) and E (2nd) differ from the first guess.  
- Tests new common letters (M, I, T) while excluding C, A, N.  

This maximizes information gain about letter placements and additional letters.",Guess 2: merit -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(-) R(-) I(x) T(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,ELDER,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane""
 Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)

 Interpretation:
 - C is not in the secret word (x)
 - R is in the secret word but not in the second position (-)
 - A is not in the secret word (x)
 - N is not in the secret word (x)
 - E is in the secret word but not in the fifth position (-)

 Therefore, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions we guessed (so R is not at position 2, E is not at position 5).
 - The secret word does not contain C, A, or N.

 Since R is in the word but not at position 2, and E is in the word but not at position 5, we need to form a new guess that includes R and E, and excludes C, A, N.

 We should also note that the secret word is 5 letters long.

 For our next guess, we want to try to place R and E in different positions and include other common letters that we haven't tested yet. We avoid using C, A, N.

 Let's think of common letters that can be used. We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We need to form a 5-letter word that has R and E, and avoids C, A, N.

 Also note that in the word ""crane"", the positions were:
 1: C (x)
 2: R (but R is in the word, just not here) -> so R must be in one of the positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? Actually, the feedback only says it's not at position 2. But note, we have a '-' for R at position 2 meaning it is elsewhere.

 Similarly, E is in the word but not at position 5, so E must be at one of the positions 1,2,3,4.

 However, we must also consider that we cannot put R and E in the same positions we already tried? Actually, we can put them in any position except the ones we know they are not. But note: we don't know where they are exactly.

 So, let's choose a word that has:
 - R in a position that is not 2, and E in a position that is not 5.

 Since we have two letters that are confirmed (R and E), we want to maximize information on the other letters.

 Possible words: We can consider words like ""TRIBE"", ""DRIVE"", ""STORE"", etc. But we have to avoid using C, A, N.

 Let me think of words that have R and E and no C, A, N.

 Another idea: We know R is in the word but not at position 2. We can try to put R in position 1? Then E in a different position? Also, we can test more vowels and common consonants.

 One good candidate is ""ROUTE"": 
   R in position 1 (which is a new position for R) 
   E in position 5? But wait, the feedback said E is not in position 5? Actually, we must avoid putting E at position 5 because we know it's not there.

 So let's put E in a position between 1 and 4.

 Alternatively, let me pick a word that places R and E in new positions and uses other common letters.

 Suggestion: ""STRETCH"" is 7 letters, too long. We need 5 letters.

 How about ""STORE"": 
   S, T, O, R, E.
   But note: in ""STORE"", R is in position 4 and E is in position 5. However, we are not allowed to put E at position 5? The feedback from ""crane"" said E is not at position 5? Actually, the feedback was for the fifth letter (E) of ""crane"" being not correct. But it does not mean that E cannot be at position 5? Wait, no: the feedback says the letter E is present in the word but not at that position. So if we put E at position 5 in ""STORE"", it might be that in the secret word E is at position 5? But wait, we know from the first guess that E is not at position 5? Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" says that E is in the word but not at position 5. Therefore, we know that E is in the secret word somewhere else, so if we put E at position 5 now, it must be incorrect? Actually, no: the feedback only told us that in the word ""crane"", the E at position 5 was not the right position. It doesn't forbid E from being at position 5? Well, if the secret word had E at position 5, then when we guessed ""crane"", which has E at position 5, we would have gotten a ✓ for E. But we got a '-' meaning it is present but not at that position. Therefore, we can deduce that E is definitely not at position 5? So we should avoid placing E at position 5 in our new guess? Actually, we can try to put E in a different position to get more information.

 So for ""STORE"":
   Positions: 
      1: S
      2: T
      3: O
      4: R
      5: E   -> but we know E is not at position 5? So this would be incorrect? Actually, we can avoid position 5 for E.

 So let me choose a word with E at positions 1-4.

 Another word: ""TRIED"" -> has E in position 5? No: T, R, I, E, D -> E is at position 4? Actually, ""TRIED"" is T-R-I-E-D: position 1: T, 2: R, 3: I, 4: E, 5: D. 
   But we have R at position 2? And in the first guess we had R at position 2 and it was present but in the wrong position? So wait: the secret word has R but not at position 2. Does that mean R must be in one of the other positions? But when we put R at position 2 again, we would expect a '-' again? Maybe we can use that to see if R is at position 2? But no: we know it's not at position 2? Actually, the feedback told us that R is not at position 2. So if we put R at position 2 again, we would get a '-' again? But we don't learn anything new by putting R in the same wrong position? Moreover, we already know R is in the word, so putting it at position 2 again would only confirm it's still not placed correctly? But we want to try to put R in a different position to hit the correct one.

 So ideally, let's place R in a position that we haven't tried. We have only tried position 2 for R. So we can try R at positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Similarly, we have only tried E at position 5? So we can try E at positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 Therefore, let's choose a word that has R at a position other than 2, and E at a position other than 5.

 Example: ""DRIVE"": 
   D, R, I, V, E
   R is at position 2? Then we would get a '-' for R again? But we want to try a different position for R? So avoid position 2.

 How about ""RODEO""? No, it has E? Actually, no: R, O, D, E, O -> yes, E at position 4.

 But ""RODEO"": 
   R at position 1 -> new position for R? 
   O? 
   D? 
   E at position 4? 
   O? 

 But ""RODEO"" has two O's? And we don't know if the secret word has O? But we can test O and D.

 However, let me think: we haven't been given any information about O and D so they are allowed? And we know we must use R and E and avoid C, A, N.

 So ""RODEO"" is a valid word? But note: the secret word might contain duplicate letters? But in this case, we don't know.

 Alternatively, let's choose a word without duplicate letters? We can get more information.

 Also, let me consider that we have two letters to include: R and E. We need three more.

 Let me try ""RESTY"": 
   R at position 1 (new position), E at position 2 (which hasn't been tried for E because we've only tried E at position 5). 
   S, T, Y? 

 But note: E is at position 2? And we don't know if E can be there? 

 Steps:

 We want to plan:
   Position for R: avoid 2 -> try 1, 3, 4, 5.
   Position for E: avoid 5 -> try 1, 2, 3, 4.

 Also, we want to test as many new letters as possible? Because we have only ruled out C, A, N.

 Let me choose a word that includes common letters: S, T, etc.

 Another candidate: ""RIPES"": 
   R at 1, I, P, E, S? Then E at position 4? S at 5? 

 But ""RIPES"" is a word? Yes.

 However, note that we have two known letters: we are including R and E, and the rest are new (I, P, S).

 How about ""STERN"": 
   S, T, E, R, N? But N is disallowed? We know N is not in the word? We cannot use N.

 So let's avoid forbidden letters: C, A, N? Forbidden letters: C, A, N.

 Therefore, any word that includes C, A, or N is invalid? We should not guess a word with these letters because we know they are not in the secret word.

 So ""STERN"" has N -> invalid.

 Words without C, A, N and that have R and E? And don't put R at position 2? And don't put E at position 5?

 Let me think of common words: 
   ""SERIF"": 
      S, E, R, I, F -> 
        E at position 2? 
        R at position 3? 
        This avoids putting R at position 2 and E at position 5? 
        Positions: 
          1: S
          2: E -> we haven't tried E at position 2? 
          3: R -> we haven't tried R at position 3? 
          4: I
          5: F

   This seems good? 

 Another: ""RESIN"": cannot because it has N? Disallowed.

 Another: ""MERIT"": M, E, R, I, T -> E at 2? R at 3? 

 But we also haven't tested M, I, T? So yes.

 However, note: in ""MERIT"", E is at position 2 and R at position 3? 

 Alternatively, what about ""BEARD"": B, E, A, R, D? But A is disallowed? Cannot use A.

 So let me check: ""TERSE"" -> 
   T, E, R, S, E -> duplicates? 
   But it has E at position 2 and 5? And we know E is not at position 5? So we avoid putting E at 5? 
   But here at position 5: E? So we shouldn't? Actually, we must avoid position 5 for E? But we can test? However, it would likely be inefficient.

 So I prefer ""MERIT"". 

 Steps:
   We'll guess ""MERIT"": 
        M at position 1 (new letter)
        E at position 2 (new position for E? Not position 5)
        R at position 3 (new position for R? Not position 2)
        I at position 4 (new letter)
        T at position 5 (new letter)

 Then we can get feedback on M, E, R, I, T.

 Also, note: if the secret word has E at position 2? Then we'd get a ✓? And similarly for R.

 So let me go with ""MERIT"".

 However, note: the first guess had R at position 2 and we got a '-', meaning R is in the secret word but not at position 2. Now we are putting R at position 3? Similarly, we are putting E at position 2? We don't know if E can be at position 2? It's possible? Because we only know E is not at position 5? 

 Therefore, let's proceed with ""MERIT"".

 Another candidate: ""RULES"": 
   R at position 1, U, L, E, S -> E at position 4? 
   And we avoid forbidden letters. 

 Both ""MERIT"" and ""RULES"" are good? But ""RULES"" uses U and L? Which are less common? Maybe? 

 But ""RULES"" also tests U and L? We don't know? So both are valid.

 However, let me choose ""MERIT"" because it includes T, which is a very common letter? And M, I? 

 So guess ""MERIT"".

 Therefore, my next guess is ""merit"".

<guess>merit</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- C, A, N are **not** in the secret word (all marked ""x"").  
- R is in the word but **not in position 2** (marked ""-"").  
- E is in the word but **not in position 5** (marked ""-"").  

Since R and E are confirmed present, the next guess must:  
1. Include R and E.  
2. Avoid C, A, N.  
3. Place R in a new position (not 2).  
4. Place E in a new position (not 5).  

The word ""merit"" meets these criteria:  
- Positions R (3rd) and E (2nd) differ from the first guess.  
- Tests new common letters (M, I, T) while excluding C, A, N.  

This maximizes information gain about letter placements and additional letters.

We need three more.\n\n Let me try ""RESTY"": \n   R at position 1 (new position), E at position 2 (which hasn\'t been tried for E because we\'ve only tried E at position 5). \n   S, T, Y? \n\n But note: E is at position 2? And we don\'t know if E can be there? \n\n Steps:\n\n We want to plan:\n   Position for R: avoid 2 -> try 1, 3, 4, 5.\n   Position for E: avoid 5 -> try 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\n Also, we want to test as many new letters as possible? Because we have only ruled out C, A, N.\n\n Let me choose a word that includes common letters: S, T, etc.\n\n Another candidate: ""RIPES"": \n   R at 1, I, P, E, S? Then E at position 4? S at 5? \n\n But ""RIPES"" is a word? Yes.\n\n However, note that we have two known letters: we are including R and E, and the rest are new (I, P, S).\n\n How about ""STERN"": \n   S, T, E, R, N? But N is disallowed? We know N is not in the word? We cannot use N.\n\n So let\'s avoid forbidden letters: C, A, N? Forbidden letters: C, A, N.\n\n Therefore, any word that includes C, A, or N is invalid? We should not guess a word with these letters because we know they are not in the secret word.\n\n So ""STERN"" has N -> invalid.\n\n Words without C, A, N and that have R and E? And don\'t put R at position 2? And don\'t put E at position 5?\n\n Let me think of common words: \n   ""SERIF"": \n      S, E, R, I, F -> \n        E at position 2? \n        R at position 3? \n        This avoids putting R at position 2 and E at position 5? \n        Positions: \n          1: S\n          2: E -> we haven\'t tried E at position 2? \n          3: R -> we haven\'t tried R at position 3? \n          4: I\n          5: F\n\n   This seems good? \n\n Another: ""RESIN"": cannot because it has N? Disallowed.\n\n Another: ""MERIT"": M, E, R, I, T -> E at 2? R at 3? \n\n But we also haven\'t tested M, I, T? So yes.\n\n However, note: in ""MERIT"", E is at position 2 and R at position 3? \n\n Alternatively, what about ""BEARD"": B, E, A, R, D? But A is disallowed? Cannot use A.\n\n So let me check: ""TERSE"" -> \n   T, E, R, S, E -> duplicates? \n   But it has E at position 2 and 5? And we know E is not at position 5? So we avoid putting E at 5? \n   But here at position 5: E? So we shouldn\'t? Actually, we must avoid position 5 for E? But we can test? However, it would likely be inefficient.\n\n So I prefer ""MERIT"". \n\n Steps:\n   We\'ll guess ""MERIT"": \n        M at position 1 (new letter)\n        E at position 2 (new position for E? Not position 5)\n        R at position 3 (new position for R? Not position 2)\n        I at position 4 (new letter)\n        T at position 5 (new letter)\n\n Then we can get feedback on M, E, R, I, T.\n\n Also, note: if the secret word has E at position 2? Then we\'d get a ✓? And similarly for R.\n\n So let me go with ""MERIT"".\n\n However, note: the first guess had R at position 2 and we got a \'-\', meaning R is in the secret word but not at position 2. Now we are putting R at position 3? Similarly, we are putting E at position 2? We don\'t know if E can be at position 2? It\'s possible? Because we only know E is not at position 5? \n\n Therefore, let\'s proceed with ""MERIT"".\n\n Another candidate: ""RULES"": \n   R at position 1, U, L, E, S -> E at position 4? \n   And we avoid forbidden letters. \n\n Both ""MERIT"" and ""RULES"" are good? But ""RULES"" uses U and L? Which are less common? Maybe? \n\n But ""RULES"" also tests U and L? We don\'t know? So both are valid.\n\n However, let me choose ""MERIT"" because it includes T, which is a very common letter? And M, I? \n\n So guess ""MERIT"".\n\n Therefore, my next guess is ""merit"".\n\n<guess>merit</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  \n- C, A, N are **not** in the secret word (all marked ""x"").  \n- R is in the word but **not in position 2** (marked ""-"").  \n- E is in the word but **not in position 5** (marked ""-"").  \n\nSince R and E are confirmed present, the next guess must:  \n1. Include R and E.  \n2. Avoid C, A, N.  \n3. Place R in a new position (not 2).  \n4. Place E in a new position (not 5).  \n\nThe word ""merit"" meets these criteria:  \n- Positions R (3rd) and E (2nd) differ from the first guess.  \n- Tests new common letters (M, I, T) while excluding C, A, N.  \n\nThis maximizes information gain about letter placements and additional letters.\n\n<guess>merit</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: merit -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(-) R(-) I(x) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
Okay, let me analyze the feedback we've received so far to make the next guess. 

First, the information from both guesses:

From Guess 1 (""crane""):
- C, A, N not in word
- R present but not position 2
- E present but not position 5

From Guess 2 (""merit""):
- M not in word (x)
- E present but not position 2 (-) → confirms E not position 5 or 2
- R present but not position 3 (-) → confirms R not position 2 or 3
- I not in word (x)
- T not in word (x)

Now we know:
✅ Present letters: R, E
⛔ Absent letters: C, A, N, M, I, T

Position constraints:
- R cannot be position 2 or 3
- E cannot be position 2 or 5

Available letters: Must include R and E, avoid C/A/N/M/I/T. That leaves lots of options: B,D,F,G,H,K,O,P,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z,and maybe others.

Given R must be in positions 1,4 or 5 (since 2/3 excluded), and E must be in positions 1,3 or 4 (since 2/5 excluded).

Possible word pattern: 5 letters including R and E, using only unused consonants/vowels.

Need to maximize information: Should test new common letters like S,D,O,L etc.

Considering words:
- ""RODEO"" → contains O/D/E/R? But O repeated and we don't know if duplicates allowed. Also E position? Wait: R-O-D-E-O → positions: R(1), O(2), D(3), E(4), O(5). E position 4 → allowed. But ""O"" appears twice - if secret word has only one O, we might get false feedback? Avoid for now? But it's possible.

Better options? Trying:
- ""POSER"": P-O-S-E-R → has S,P,O,R,E. Positions: E at 4? R at 5? Both new positions. Tests P,O,S.
- Checks: R at position 5 (new), E at 4 (new). No conflicting letters. That could be good.

Another option: ""LOSER"". But L not tested? We get ""L"" info? Actually same structure: L-O-S-E-R → E at 4, R at 5.

But note: We only have 6 total guesses. We used 2, have 4 left? Since we're on guess 3.

But wait: feedback for ""merit"" showed E(-) at position 2 - that means E exists elsewhere? So yes, E is in word but not at position 2. Similarly R not at position 2 or 3? So we are narrowing down? We know R must be at pos 1,4,5 and E at pos 1,3,4? Since E cannot be at position 2 or 5? And R cannot be at 2 or 3?

Also, secret word has these two letters still? We haven't placed them? So we need to focus on placing R and E? Also, the word has 5 letters? We know two letters? The other three letters are unknown? And not among the excluded letters? So a lot possible? Better to choose a word with more new letters? So ""POSER"" tests P O S? But note, we haven't tested these? So they could be in or out? Good to test.

But also possible: ""FORES"". F-O-R-E-S → R at position 3 → which was excluded? Because from ""merit"", R cannot be at position 3? So we must not put R at position 3? ""FORES"" has R at position 3 → invalid? Because we know R not at position 3? So cannot test words putting R in known wrong positions? So ""FORES"" invalid? Similarly, we cannot put E in position 2 or 5? Or R in 2 or 3? So ""POSER"": R at position 5? Which is new? And E at position 4? Also new? So that works.

Another possibility: ""ROUGH"". But no E? Must include E? So invalid.

Alternative word: ""OILER"" → but I not in word? And we have I excluded? So invalid? Because I is absent? Cannot use I? So discard.

Any better? ""POWER"" → no E? Wait, has E? P-O-W-E-R? E at 4? R at 5? And includes W? But ""POWER"" is five letters? Positions: P(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), R(5)? That seems good? But does it have any known absent letters? C,A,N,M,I,T - none used? So valid? Plus tests P,O,W? 

But compare to ""POSER"": also tests P,O,S? S is more common? Maybe better? Alternatively, ""POSER"" also has S? Which is common? Maybe ""POSER"" better? But ""POWER"" includes W? Which is less common? So perhaps ""POSER"" better?

But note: ""POSER"" has S? Could test S? While ""POWER"" tests W? I think S is more frequent? So prefer ""POSER""? Or ""ROUSE"" → R-O-U-S-E → R at pos1? O at2? U at3? S at4? E at5 → but E at5 not allowed? Because we know E not at position 5? So cannot use position 5 for E? So discard.

Thus ""POSER"": E at position 4? Which is new? R at position 5? New? So positions: 
- Position 1: P? New? 
- Position 2: O? New? 
- Position 3: S? New? 
- Position 4: E → attempting E at position 4? Which is an allowed position? 
- Position 5: R → attempting R at position 5? Which is allowed? 

Plus tests new letters P,O,S? Which are common? 

So let's go with ""POSER"".

In summary: 
- Previous constraints handled? 
- Includes R and E? In new positions? 
- Uses all new letters? 
- Avoids forbidden letters? Yes?

Based on the feedback:

**Feedback Analysis**
1. **New Absent Letters**: M, I, T (so far: C, A, N, M, I, T excluded)
2. **Confirmed Presence**: 
   - R is in the secret word but now confirmed *not at positions 2 or 3* (received ""-"" in both guesses). 
   - E is in the secret word but confirmed *not at positions 2 or 5* (received ""-"" in both guesses).
3. **Position Constraints**:
   - R can only be at positions 1, 4, or 5.
   - E can only be at positions 1, 3, or 4.

**Next Guess Strategy**
- Must include **R and E**, exclude C/A/N/M/I/T.
- Prioritize **new common consonants/vowels**: S, O, D, L, P (untested).
- Place R/E in **new valid positions**: E at 3/4? R at 1/4/5?
- Ideal word structure: Tests 3 new letters + R/E?  
- Top candidate: **""POSER""**  
  - P (new), O (new), S (new), E (position 4? new slot), R (position 5? new slot)

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane""
 Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)

 Interpretation:
 - C is not in the secret word (x)
 - R is in the secret word but not in the second position (-)
 - A is not in the secret word (x)
 - N is not in the secret word (x)
 - E is in the secret word but not in the fifth position (-)

 Therefore, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions we guessed (so R is not at position 2, E is not at position 5).
 - The secret word does not contain C, A, or N.

 Since R is in the word but not at position 2, and E is in the word but not at position 5, we need to form a new guess that includes R and E, and excludes C, A, N.

 We should also note that the secret word is 5 letters long.

 For our next guess, we want to try to place R and E in different positions and include other common letters that we haven't tested yet. We avoid using C, A, N.

 Let's think of common letters that can be used. We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We need to form a 5-letter word that has R and E, and avoids C, A, N.

 Also note that in the word ""crane"", the positions were:
 1: C (x)
 2: R (but R is in the word, just not here) -> so R must be in one of the positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? Actually, the feedback only says it's not at position 2. But note, we have a '-' for R at position 2 meaning it is elsewhere.

 Similarly, E is in the word but not at position 5, so E must be at one of the positions 1,2,3,4.

 However, we must also consider that we cannot put R and E in the same positions we already tried? Actually, we can put them in any position except the ones we know they are not. But note: we don't know where they are exactly.

 So, let's choose a word that has:
 - R in a position that is not 2, and E in a position that is not 5.

 Since we have two letters that are confirmed (R and E), we want to maximize information on the other letters.

 Possible words: We can consider words like ""TRIBE"", ""DRIVE"", ""STORE"", etc. But we have to avoid using C, A, N.

 Let me think of words that have R and E and no C, A, N.

 Another idea: We know R is in the word but not at position 2. We can try to put R in position 1? Then E in a different position? Also, we can test more vowels and common consonants.

 One good candidate is ""ROUTE"": 
   R in position 1 (which is a new position for R) 
   E in position 5? But wait, the feedback said E is not in position 5? Actually, we must avoid putting E at position 5 because we know it's not there.

 So let's put E in a position between 1 and 4.

 Alternatively, let me pick a word that places R and E in new positions and uses other common letters.

 Suggestion: ""STRETCH"" is 7 letters, too long. We need 5 letters.

 How about ""STORE"": 
   S, T, O, R, E.
   But note: in ""STORE"", R is in position 4 and E is in position 5. However, we are not allowed to put E at position 5? The feedback from ""crane"" said E is not at position 5? Actually, the feedback was for the fifth letter (E) of ""crane"" being not correct. But it does not mean that E cannot be at position 5? Wait, no: the feedback says the letter E is present in the word but not at that position. So if we put E at position 5 in ""STORE"", it might be that in the secret word E is at position 5? But wait, we know from the first guess that E is not at position 5? Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" says that E is in the word but not at position 5. Therefore, we know that E is in the secret word somewhere else, so if we put E at position 5 now, it must be incorrect? Actually, no: the feedback only told us that in the word ""crane"", the E at position 5 was not the right position. It doesn't forbid E from being at position 5? Well, if the secret word had E at position 5, then when we guessed ""crane"", which has E at position 5, we would have gotten a ✓ for E. But we got a '-' meaning it is present but not at that position. Therefore, we can deduce that E is definitely not at position 5? So we should avoid placing E at position 5 in our new guess? Actually, we can try to put E in a different position to get more information.

 So for ""STORE"":
   Positions: 
      1: S
      2: T
      3: O
      4: R
      5: E   -> but we know E is not at position 5? So this would be incorrect? Actually, we can avoid position 5 for E.

 So let me choose a word with E at positions 1-4.

 Another word: ""TRIED"" -> has E in position 5? No: T, R, I, E, D -> E is at position 4? Actually, ""TRIED"" is T-R-I-E-D: position 1: T, 2: R, 3: I, 4: E, 5: D. 
   But we have R at position 2? And in the first guess we had R at position 2 and it was present but in the wrong position? So wait: the secret word has R but not at position 2. Does that mean R must be in one of the other positions? But when we put R at position 2 again, we would expect a '-' again? Maybe we can use that to see if R is at position 2? But no: we know it's not at position 2? Actually, the feedback told us that R is not at position 2. So if we put R at position 2 again, we would get a '-' again? But we don't learn anything new by putting R in the same wrong position? Moreover, we already know R is in the word, so putting it at position 2 again would only confirm it's still not placed correctly? But we want to try to put R in a different position to hit the correct one.

 So ideally, let's place R in a position that we haven't tried. We have only tried position 2 for R. So we can try R at positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Similarly, we have only tried E at position 5? So we can try E at positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 Therefore, let's choose a word that has R at a position other than 2, and E at a position other than 5.

 Example: ""DRIVE"": 
   D, R, I, V, E
   R is at position 2? Then we would get a '-' for R again? But we want to try a different position for R? So avoid position 2.

 How about ""RODEO""? No, it has E? Actually, no: R, O, D, E, O -> yes, E at position 4.

 But ""RODEO"": 
   R at position 1 -> new position for R? 
   O? 
   D? 
   E at position 4? 
   O? 

 But ""RODEO"" has two O's? And we don't know if the secret word has O? But we can test O and D.

 However, let me think: we haven't been given any information about O and D so they are allowed? And we know we must use R and E and avoid C, A, N.

 So ""RODEO"" is a valid word? But note: the secret word might contain duplicate letters? But in this case, we don't know.

 Alternatively, let's choose a word without duplicate letters? We can get more information.

 Also, let me consider that we have two letters to include: R and E. We need three more.

 Let me try ""RESTY"": 
   R at position 1 (new position), E at position 2 (which hasn't been tried for E because we've only tried E at position 5). 
   S, T, Y? 

 But note: E is at position 2? And we don't know if E can be there? 

 Steps:

 We want to plan:
   Position for R: avoid 2 -> try 1, 3, 4, 5.
   Position for E: avoid 5 -> try 1, 2, 3, 4.

 Also, we want to test as many new letters as possible? Because we have only ruled out C, A, N.

 Let me choose a word that includes common letters: S, T, etc.

 Another candidate: ""RIPES"": 
   R at 1, I, P, E, S? Then E at position 4? S at 5? 

 But ""RIPES"" is a word? Yes.

 However, note that we have two known letters: we are including R and E, and the rest are new (I, P, S).

 How about ""STERN"": 
   S, T, E, R, N? But N is disallowed? We know N is not in the word? We cannot use N.

 So let's avoid forbidden letters: C, A, N? Forbidden letters: C, A, N.

 Therefore, any word that includes C, A, or N is invalid? We should not guess a word with these letters because we know they are not in the secret word.

 So ""STERN"" has N -> invalid.

 Words without C, A, N and that have R and E? And don't put R at position 2? And don't put E at position 5?

 Let me think of common words: 
   ""SERIF"": 
      S, E, R, I, F -> 
        E at position 2? 
        R at position 3? 
        This avoids putting R at position 2 and E at position 5? 
        Positions: 
          1: S
          2: E -> we haven't tried E at position 2? 
          3: R -> we haven't tried R at position 3? 
          4: I
          5: F

   This seems good? 

 Another: ""RESIN"": cannot because it has N? Disallowed.

 Another: ""MERIT"": M, E, R, I, T -> E at 2? R at 3? 

 But we also haven't tested M, I, T? So yes.

 However, note: in ""MERIT"", E is at position 2 and R at position 3? 

 Alternatively, what about ""BEARD"": B, E, A, R, D? But A is disallowed? Cannot use A.

 So let me check: ""TERSE"" -> 
   T, E, R, S, E -> duplicates? 
   But it has E at position 2 and 5? And we know E is not at position 5? So we avoid putting E at 5? 
   But here at position 5: E? So we shouldn't? Actually, we must avoid position 5 for E? But we can test? However, it would likely be inefficient.

 So I prefer ""MERIT"". 

 Steps:
   We'll guess ""MERIT"": 
        M at position 1 (new letter)
        E at position 2 (new position for E? Not position 5)
        R at position 3 (new position for R? Not position 2)
        I at position 4 (new letter)
        T at position 5 (new letter)

 Then we can get feedback on M, E, R, I, T.

 Also, note: if the secret word has E at position 2? Then we'd get a ✓? And similarly for R.

 So let me go with ""MERIT"".

 However, note: the first guess had R at position 2 and we got a '-', meaning R is in the secret word but not at position 2. Now we are putting R at position 3? Similarly, we are putting E at position 2? We don't know if E can be at position 2? It's possible? Because we only know E is not at position 5? 

 Therefore, let's proceed with ""MERIT"".

 Another candidate: ""RULES"": 
   R at position 1, U, L, E, S -> E at position 4? 
   And we avoid forbidden letters. 

 Both ""MERIT"" and ""RULES"" are good? But ""RULES"" uses U and L? Which are less common? Maybe? 

 But ""RULES"" also tests U and L? We don't know? So both are valid.

 However, let me choose ""MERIT"" because it includes T, which is a very common letter? And M, I? 

 So guess ""MERIT"".

 Therefore, my next guess is ""merit"".

<guess>merit</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- C, A, N are **not** in the secret word (all marked ""x"").  
- R is in the word but **not in position 2** (marked ""-"").  
- E is in the word but **not in position 5** (marked ""-"").  

Since R and E are confirmed present, the next guess must:  
1. Include R and E.  
2. Avoid C, A, N.  
3. Place R in a new position (not 2).  
4. Place E in a new position (not 5).  

The word ""merit"" meets these criteria:  
- Positions R (3rd) and E (2nd) differ from the first guess.  
- Tests new common letters (M, I, T) while excluding C, A, N.  

This maximizes information gain about letter placements and additional letters.

<guess>merit</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: merit -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(-) R(-) I(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>Okay, let me analyze the feedback we've received so far to make the next guess. 

First, the information from both guesses:

From Guess 1 (""crane""):
- C, A, N not in word
- R present but not position 2
- E present but not position 5

From Guess 2 (""merit""):
- M not in word (x)
- E present but not position 2 (-) → confirms E not position 5 or 2
- R present but not position 3 (-) → confirms R not position 2 or 3
- I not in word (x)
- T not in word (x)

Now we know:
✅ Present letters: R, E
⛔ Absent letters: C, A, N, M, I, T

Position constraints:
- R cannot be position 2 or 3
- E cannot be position 2 or 5

Available letters: Must include R and E, avoid C/A/N/M/I/T. That leaves lots of options: B,D,F,G,H,K,O,P,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z,and maybe others.

Given R must be in positions 1,4 or 5 (since 2/3 excluded), and E must be in positions 1,3 or 4 (since 2/5 excluded).

Possible word pattern: 5 letters including R and E, using only unused consonants/vowels.

Need to maximize information: Should test new common letters like S,D,O,L etc.

Considering words:
- ""RODEO"" → contains O/D/E/R? But O repeated and we don't know if duplicates allowed. Also E position? Wait: R-O-D-E-O → positions: R(1), O(2), D(3), E(4), O(5). E position 4 → allowed. But ""O"" appears twice - if secret word has only one O, we might get false feedback? Avoid for now? But it's possible.

Better options? Trying:
- ""POSER"": P-O-S-E-R → has S,P,O,R,E. Positions: E at 4? R at 5? Both new positions. Tests P,O,S.
- Checks: R at position 5 (new), E at 4 (new). No conflicting letters. That could be good.

Another option: ""LOSER"". But L not tested? We get ""L"" info? Actually same structure: L-O-S-E-R → E at 4, R at 5.

But note: We only have 6 total guesses. We used 2, have 4 left? Since we're on guess 3.

But wait: feedback for ""merit"" showed E(-) at position 2 - that means E exists elsewhere? So yes, E is in word but not at position 2. Similarly R not at position 2 or 3? So we are narrowing down? We know R must be at pos 1,4,5 and E at pos 1,3,4? Since E cannot be at position 2 or 5? And R cannot be at 2 or 3?

Also, secret word has these two letters still? We haven't placed them? So we need to focus on placing R and E? Also, the word has 5 letters? We know two letters? The other three letters are unknown? And not among the excluded letters? So a lot possible? Better to choose a word with more new letters? So ""POSER"" tests P O S? But note, we haven't tested these? So they could be in or out? Good to test.

But also possible: ""FORES"". F-O-R-E-S → R at position 3 → which was excluded? Because from ""merit"", R cannot be at position 3? So we must not put R at position 3? ""FORES"" has R at position 3 → invalid? Because we know R not at position 3? So cannot test words putting R in known wrong positions? So ""FORES"" invalid? Similarly, we cannot put E in position 2 or 5? Or R in 2 or 3? So ""POSER"": R at position 5? Which is new? And E at position 4? Also new? So that works.

Another possibility: ""ROUGH"". But no E? Must include E? So invalid.

Alternative word: ""OILER"" → but I not in word? And we have I excluded? So invalid? Because I is absent? Cannot use I? So discard.

Any better? ""POWER"" → no E? Wait, has E? P-O-W-E-R? E at 4? R at 5? And includes W? But ""POWER"" is five letters? Positions: P(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), R(5)? That seems good? But does it have any known absent letters? C,A,N,M,I,T - none used? So valid? Plus tests P,O,W? 

But compare to ""POSER"": also tests P,O,S? S is more common? Maybe better? Alternatively, ""POSER"" also has S? Which is common? Maybe ""POSER"" better? But ""POWER"" includes W? Which is less common? So perhaps ""POSER"" better?

But note: ""POSER"" has S? Could test S? While ""POWER"" tests W? I think S is more frequent? So prefer ""POSER""? Or ""ROUSE"" → R-O-U-S-E → R at pos1? O at2? U at3? S at4? E at5 → but E at5 not allowed? Because we know E not at position 5? So cannot use position 5 for E? So discard.

Thus ""POSER"": E at position 4? Which is new? R at position 5? New? So positions: 
- Position 1: P? New? 
- Position 2: O? New? 
- Position 3: S? New? 
- Position 4: E → attempting E at position 4? Which is an allowed position? 
- Position 5: R → attempting R at position 5? Which is allowed? 

Plus tests new letters P,O,S? Which are common? 

So let's go with ""POSER"".

In summary: 
- Previous constraints handled? 
- Includes R and E? In new positions? 
- Uses all new letters? 
- Avoids forbidden letters? Yes?Based on the feedback:

**Feedback Analysis**
1. **New Absent Letters**: M, I, T (so far: C, A, N, M, I, T excluded)
2. **Confirmed Presence**: 
   - R is in the secret word but now confirmed *not at positions 2 or 3* (received ""-"" in both guesses). 
   - E is in the secret word but confirmed *not at positions 2 or 5* (received ""-"" in both guesses).
3. **Position Constraints**:
   - R can only be at positions 1, 4, or 5.
   - E can only be at positions 1, 3, or 4.

**Next Guess Strategy**
- Must include **R and E**, exclude C/A/N/M/I/T.
- Prioritize **new common consonants/vowels**: S, O, D, L, P (untested).
- Place R/E in **new valid positions**: E at 3/4? R at 1/4/5?
- Ideal word structure: Tests 3 new letters + R/E?  
- Top candidate: **""POSER""**  
  - P (new), O (new), S (new), E (position 4? new slot), R (position 5? new slot)  
  - Tests E at pos 4? R at pos 5? Maximizes coverage of S/O/P?

We avoid using C, A, N.\n\n Let\'s think of common letters that can be used. We haven\'t tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n We need to form a 5-letter word that has R and E, and avoids C, A, N.\n\n Also note that in the word ""crane"", the positions were:\n 1: C (x)\n 2: R (but R is in the word, just not here) -> so R must be in one of the positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? Actually, the feedback only says it\'s not at position 2. But note, we have a \'-\' for R at position 2 meaning it is elsewhere.\n\n Similarly, E is in the word but not at position 5, so E must be at one of the positions 1,2,3,4.\n\n However, we must also consider that we cannot put R and E in the same positions we already tried? Actually, we can put them in any position except the ones we know they are not. But note: we don\'t know where they are exactly.\n\n So, let\'s choose a word that has:\n - R in a position that is not 2, and E in a position that is not 5.\n\n Since we have two letters that are confirmed (R and E), we want to maximize information on the other letters.\n\n Possible words: We can consider words like ""TRIBE"", ""DRIVE"", ""STORE"", etc. But we have to avoid using C, A, N.\n\n Let me think of words that have R and E and no C, A, N.\n\n Another idea: We know R is in the word but not at position 2. We can try to put R in position 1? Then E in a different position? Also, we can test more vowels and common consonants.\n\n One good candidate is ""ROUTE"": \n   R in position 1 (which is a new position for R) \n   E in position 5? But wait, the feedback said E is not in position 5? Actually, we must avoid putting E at position 5 because we know it\'s not there.\n\n So let\'s put E in a position between 1 and 4.\n\n Alternatively, let me pick a word that places R and E in new positions and uses other common letters.\n\n Suggestion: ""STRETCH"" is 7 letters, too long. We need 5 letters.\n\n How about ""STORE"": \n   S, T, O, R, E.\n   But note: in ""STORE"", R is in position 4 and E is in position 5. However, we are not allowed to put E at position 5? The feedback from ""crane"" said E is not at position 5? Actually, the feedback was for the fifth letter (E) of ""crane"" being not correct. But it does not mean that E cannot be at position 5? Wait, no: the feedback says the letter E is present in the word but not at that position. So if we put E at position 5 in ""STORE"", it might be that in the secret word E is at position 5? But wait, we know from the first guess that E is not at position 5? Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" says that E is in the word but not at position 5. Therefore, we know that E is in the secret word somewhere else, so if we put E at position 5 now, it must be incorrect? Actually, no: the feedback only told us that in the word ""crane"", the E at position 5 was not the right position. It doesn\'t forbid E from being at position 5? Well, if the secret word had E at position 5, then when we guessed ""crane"", which has E at position 5, we would have gotten a ✓ for E. But we got a \'-\' meaning it is present but not at that position. Therefore, we can deduce that E is definitely not at position 5? So we should avoid placing E at position 5 in our new guess? Actually, we can try to put E in a different position to get more information.\n\n So for ""STORE"":\n   Positions: \n      1: S\n      2: T\n      3: O\n      4: R\n      5: E   -> but we know E is not at position 5? So this would be incorrect? Actually, we can avoid position 5 for E.\n\n So let me choose a word with E at positions 1-4.\n\n Another word: ""TRIED"" -> has E in position 5? No: T, R, I, E, D -> E is at position 4? Actually, ""TRIED"" is T-R-I-E-D: position 1: T, 2: R, 3: I, 4: E, 5: D. \n   But we have R at position 2? And in the first guess we had R at position 2 and it was present but in the wrong position? So wait: the secret word has R but not at position 2. Does that mean R must be in one of the other positions? But when we put R at position 2 again, we would expect a \'-\' again? Maybe we can use that to see if R is at position 2? But no: we know it\'s not at position 2? Actually, the feedback told us that R is not at position 2. So if we put R at position 2 again, we would get a \'-\' again? But we don\'t learn anything new by putting R in the same wrong position? Moreover, we already know R is in the word, so putting it at position 2 again would only confirm it\'s still not placed correctly? But we want to try to put R in a different position to hit the correct one.\n\n So ideally, let\'s place R in a position that we haven\'t tried. We have only tried position 2 for R. So we can try R at positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\n Similarly, we have only tried E at position 5? So we can try E at positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n Therefore, let\'s choose a word that has R at a position other than 2, and E at a position other than 5.\n\n Example: ""DRIVE"": \n   D, R, I, V, E\n   R is at position 2? Then we would get a \'-\' for R again? But we want to try a different position for R? So avoid position 2.\n\n How about ""RODEO""? No, it has E? Actually, no: R, O, D, E, O -> yes, E at position 4.\n\n But ""RODEO"": \n   R at position 1 -> new position for R? \n   O? \n   D? \n   E at position 4? \n   O? \n\n But ""RODEO"" has two O\'s? And we don\'t know if the secret word has O? But we can test O and D.\n\n However, let me think: we haven\'t been given any information about O and D so they are allowed? And we know we must use R and E and avoid C, A, N.\n\n So ""RODEO"" is a valid word? But note: the secret word might contain duplicate letters? But in this case, we don\'t know.\n\n Alternatively, let\'s choose a word without duplicate letters? We can get more information.\n\n Also, let me consider that we have two letters to include: R and E. We need three more.\n\n Let me try ""RESTY"": \n   R at position 1 (new position), E at position 2 (which hasn\'t been tried for E because we\'ve only tried E at position 5). \n   S, T, Y? \n\n But note: E is at position 2? And we don\'t know if E can be there? \n\n Steps:\n\n We want to plan:\n   Position for R: avoid 2 -> try 1, 3, 4, 5.\n   Position for E: avoid 5 -> try 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\n Also, we want to test as many new letters as possible? Because we have only ruled out C, A, N.\n\n Let me choose a word that includes common letters: S, T, etc.\n\n Another candidate: ""RIPES"": \n   R at 1, I, P, E, S? Then E at position 4? S at 5? \n\n But ""RIPES"" is a word? Yes.\n\n However, note that we have two known letters: we are including R and E, and the rest are new (I, P, S).\n\n How about ""STERN"": \n   S, T, E, R, N? But N is disallowed? We know N is not in the word? We cannot use N.\n\n So let\'s avoid forbidden letters: C, A, N? Forbidden letters: C, A, N.\n\n Therefore, any word that includes C, A, or N is invalid? We should not guess a word with these letters because we know they are not in the secret word.\n\n So ""STERN"" has N -> invalid.\n\n Words without C, A, N and that have R and E? And don\'t put R at position 2? And don\'t put E at position 5?\n\n Let me think of common words: \n   ""SERIF"": \n      S, E, R, I, F -> \n        E at position 2? \n        R at position 3? \n        This avoids putting R at position 2 and E at position 5? \n        Positions: \n          1: S\n          2: E -> we haven\'t tried E at position 2? \n          3: R -> we haven\'t tried R at position 3? \n          4: I\n          5: F\n\n   This seems good? \n\n Another: ""RESIN"": cannot because it has N? Disallowed.\n\n Another: ""MERIT"": M, E, R, I, T -> E at 2? R at 3? \n\n But we also haven\'t tested M, I, T? So yes.\n\n However, note: in ""MERIT"", E is at position 2 and R at position 3? \n\n Alternatively, what about ""BEARD"": B, E, A, R, D? But A is disallowed? Cannot use A.\n\n So let me check: ""TERSE"" -> \n   T, E, R, S, E -> duplicates? \n   But it has E at position 2 and 5? And we know E is not at position 5? So we avoid putting E at 5? \n   But here at position 5: E? So we shouldn\'t? Actually, we must avoid position 5 for E? But we can test? However, it would likely be inefficient.\n\n So I prefer ""MERIT"". \n\n Steps:\n   We\'ll guess ""MERIT"": \n        M at position 1 (new letter)\n        E at position 2 (new position for E? Not position 5)\n        R at position 3 (new position for R? Not position 2)\n        I at position 4 (new letter)\n        T at position 5 (new letter)\n\n Then we can get feedback on M, E, R, I, T.\n\n Also, note: if the secret word has E at position 2? Then we\'d get a ✓? And similarly for R.\n\n So let me go with ""MERIT"".\n\n However, note: the first guess had R at position 2 and we got a \'-\', meaning R is in the secret word but not at position 2. Now we are putting R at position 3? Similarly, we are putting E at position 2? We don\'t know if E can be at position 2? It\'s possible? Because we only know E is not at position 5? \n\n Therefore, let\'s proceed with ""MERIT"".\n\n Another candidate: ""RULES"": \n   R at position 1, U, L, E, S -> E at position 4? \n   And we avoid forbidden letters. \n\n Both ""MERIT"" and ""RULES"" are good? But ""RULES"" uses U and L? Which are less common? Maybe? \n\n But ""RULES"" also tests U and L? We don\'t know? So both are valid.\n\n However, let me choose ""MERIT"" because it includes T, which is a very common letter? And M, I? \n\n So guess ""MERIT"".\n\n Therefore, my next guess is ""merit"".\n\n<guess>merit</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  \n- C, A, N are **not** in the secret word (all marked ""x"").  \n- R is in the word but **not in position 2** (marked ""-"").  \n- E is in the word but **not in position 5** (marked ""-"").  \n\nSince R and E are confirmed present, the next guess must:  \n1.

Place E in a new position (not 5).  \n\nThe word ""merit"" meets these criteria:  \n- Positions R (3rd) and E (2nd) differ from the first guess.  \n- Tests new common letters (M, I, T) while excluding C, A, N.  \n\nThis maximizes information gain about letter placements and additional letters.\n\n<guess>merit</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: merit -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(-) R(-) I(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Okay, let me analyze the feedback we\'ve received so far to make the next guess. \n\nFirst, the information from both guesses:\n\nFrom Guess 1 (""crane""):\n- C, A, N not in word\n- R present but not position 2\n- E present but not position 5\n\nFrom Guess 2 (""merit""):\n- M not in word (x)\n- E present but not position 2 (-) → confirms E not position 5 or 2\n- R present but not position 3 (-) → confirms R not position 2 or 3\n- I not in word (x)\n- T not in word (x)\n\nNow we know:\n✅ Present letters: R, E\n⛔ Absent letters: C, A, N, M, I, T\n\nPosition constraints:\n- R cannot be position 2 or 3\n- E cannot be position 2 or 5\n\nAvailable letters: Must include R and E, avoid C/A/N/M/I/T. That leaves lots of options: B,D,F,G,H,K,O,P,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z,and maybe others.\n\nGiven R must be in positions 1,4 or 5 (since 2/3 excluded), and E must be in positions 1,3 or 4 (since 2/5 excluded).\n\nPossible word pattern: 5 letters including R and E, using only unused consonants/vowels.\n\nNeed to maximize information: Should test new common letters like S,D,O,L etc.\n\nConsidering words:\n- ""RODEO"" → contains O/D/E/R? But O repeated and we don\'t know if duplicates allowed. Also E position? Wait: R-O-D-E-O → positions: R(1), O(2), D(3), E(4), O(5). E position 4 → allowed. But ""O"" appears twice - if secret word has only one O, we might get false feedback? Avoid for now? But it\'s possible.\n\nBetter options? Trying:\n- ""POSER"": P-O-S-E-R → has S,P,O,R,E. Positions: E at 4? R at 5? Both new positions. Tests P,O,S.\n- Checks: R at position 5 (new), E at 4 (new). No conflicting letters. That could be good.\n\nAnother option: ""LOSER"". But L not tested? We get ""L"" info? Actually same structure: L-O-S-E-R → E at 4, R at 5.\n\nBut note: We only have 6 total guesses. We used 2, have 4 left? Since we\'re on guess 3.\n\nBut wait: feedback for ""merit"" showed E(-) at position 2 - that means E exists elsewhere? So yes, E is in word but not at position 2. Similarly R not at position 2 or 3? So we are narrowing down? We know R must be at pos 1,4,5 and E at pos 1,3,4? Since E cannot be at position 2 or 5? And R cannot be at 2 or 3?\n\nAlso, secret word has these two letters still? We haven\'t placed them? So we need to focus on placing R and E? Also, the word has 5 letters? We know two letters? The other three letters are unknown? And not among the excluded letters? So a lot possible? Better to choose a word with more new letters? So ""POSER"" tests P O S? But note, we haven\'t tested these? So they could be in or out? Good to test.\n\nBut also possible: ""FORES"". F-O-R-E-S → R at position 3 → which was excluded? Because from ""merit"", R cannot be at position 3? So we must not put R at position 3? ""FORES"" has R at position 3 → invalid? Because we know R not at position 3? So cannot test words putting R in known wrong positions? So ""FORES"" invalid? Similarly, we cannot put E in position 2 or 5? Or R in 2 or 3? So ""POSER"": R at position 5? Which is new? And E at position 4? Also new? So that works.\n\nAnother possibility: ""ROUGH"". But no E? Must include E? So invalid.\n\nAlternative word: ""OILER"" → but I not in word? And we have I excluded? So invalid? Because I is absent? Cannot use I? So discard.\n\nAny better? ""POWER"" → no E? Wait, has E? P-O-W-E-R? E at 4? R at 5? And includes W? But ""POWER"" is five letters? Positions: P(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), R(5)? That seems good? But does it have any known absent letters? C,A,N,M,I,T - none used? So valid? Plus tests P,O,W? \n\nBut compare to ""POSER"": also tests P,O,S? S is more common? Maybe better? Alternatively, ""POSER"" also has S? Which is common? Maybe ""POSER"" better? But ""POWER"" includes W? Which is less common? So perhaps ""POSER"" better?\n\nBut note: ""POSER"" has S? Could test S? While ""POWER"" tests W? I think S is more frequent? So prefer ""POSER""? Or ""ROUSE"" → R-O-U-S-E → R at pos1? O at2? U at3? S at4? E at5 → but E at5 not allowed? Because we know E not at position 5? So cannot use position 5 for E? So discard.\n\nThus ""POSER"": E at position 4? Which is new? R at position 5? New? So positions: \n- Position 1: P? New? \n- Position 2: O? New? \n- Position 3: S? New? \n- Position 4: E → attempting E at position 4? Which is an allowed position? \n- Position 5: R → attempting R at position 5? Which is allowed? \n\nPlus tests new letters P,O,S? Which are common? \n\nSo let\'s go with ""POSER"".\n\nIn summary: \n- Previous constraints handled? \n- Includes R and E? In new positions? \n- Uses all new letters? \n- Avoids forbidden letters?

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: absent (x)
- R: present but wrong position (-) -> so R is in the word, not at position 2
- A: absent (x)
- N: absent (x)
- E: present but wrong position (-) -> so E is in the word, not at position 5

Guess 2: ""merit""
- M: absent (x)
- E: present but wrong position (-) -> E is not at position 2 (since we tried it at position 2 and got -)
- R: present but wrong position (-) -> R is not at position 3 (since we tried it at position 3 and got -)
- I: absent (x)
- T: absent (x)

Guess 3: ""poser""
- P: absent (x)
- O: absent (x)
- S: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓) -> so E is at position 4
- R: correct position (✓) -> so R is at position 5

So now we know:
- The secret word has E at position 4 and R at position 5.
- The letters that are absent: C, A, N, M, I, T, P, O, S (from the x's in all guesses)
- We also know that R and E are in the word, and we now know their positions: E at 4, R at 5.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: _ _ _ E R

We need to find the first three letters. We know the following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, M, I, T, P, O, S.

We have to choose a word that fits: _ _ _ E R, and uses letters that are not in the excluded list.

Excluded letters: C, A, N, M, I, T, P, O, S.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

We have to make a guess that uses only available letters and fits the pattern.

Let's think of words ending with ""ER"". Common words: 
- like ""TIGER"" but T is excluded? T is absent, so no.
- ""WATER"" but W is available? But A is excluded? A is absent, so no.
- ""PAPER"" but P and A are excluded? No.
- ""LOWER"" but O is excluded? O is absent, so no.

We need to avoid the excluded letters.

Possible words: 
- ""LUGER"": L, U, G, E, R -> but we have E and R fixed? So the word would be ? ? ? E R, so the first three letters are L, U, G? But ""LUGER"" is a word? Yes, meaning a type of pistol or a sled.

Check letters: L, U, G are all in the available set? Yes.

But we have to consider: we don't know if L, U, G are in the word? We are testing them.

Another word: ""JEWEL""? But that ends with L? Not ""ER"". We need ""ER"" at the end.

Another: ""BOXER"" -> B, O, X, E, R -> but O is excluded? O is absent, so no.

Another: ""FEWER"" -> F, E, W, E, R -> but we have two E's? The pattern is _ _ _ E R, so the third letter must be a letter? And we have E at position 4? But ""FEWER"" has E at position 2 and 4? But we don't know if the word has two E's? It might? But in our pattern, we only have one E at position 4? So if we guess ""FEWER"", it would be F at 1, E at 2, W at 3, E at 4, R at 5? But we know E is at position 4? So the E at position 2 would be a new E? But we don't know if the word has two E's? It's possible? But we have to avoid using excluded letters? E is not excluded? But we know E is in the word? But we don't know if it appears twice? However, in the feedback so far, we only have one E? But that doesn't mean it can't be two? So we can try? But let's see: the pattern is fixed for positions 4 and 5: E and R? So the first three are unknown? But in ""FEWER"", the first three are F, E, W? Then E at 4? So the word would be F E W E R? But we are guessing the first three as F, E, W? And then E and R? But we are testing E at position 2? Which we know from guess2 that E is not at position 2? Because in ""merit"", E at position 2 got a '-', meaning E is in the word but not at position 2? So if we put E at position 2 again, it would be incorrect? And we would get a '-' again? But we already know that? So it's a waste? We should avoid putting E in a position we know it's not? So we should not put E at position 2? Similarly, we know E is not at position 5? But we are not putting it there? So for the first three positions, we should not put E? Because we know E is at position 4? And we don't have information about other E's? But we know E is not at position 2? And we haven't tried position 1 or 3? But we can try? However, we are trying to find the first three letters? And we know E is at position 4? So the first three positions are not E? Because if they were E, then we would have multiple E's? But we don't know? So to be safe, we should avoid putting E in the first three? Because we are not sure? But we can use E? But we know that position 2 is invalid for E? So we can put E at position 1 or 3? But if we put E at position 1, then we have E at 1 and E at 4? That's possible? But we don't know? 

But let's reconsider: we have only one E confirmed? But the feedback doesn't tell us the count? So it could be multiple? But to maximize information, we should avoid using E again? Because we already know one E? And we know its position? So we can focus on finding the other letters? So it's better to use three new letters for the first three positions? Without E? Because if we use E, we might not get new information? For example, if we put E at position 1, and if it is present, we get a ✓? But we already know E is in the word? So it doesn't help? And if it's not, we get x? But we know E is in the word? So it must be present? So we would get a '-' if it's not at that position? Or if it is, we get ✓? But we are trying to find the first three? So it might be better to use non-E letters? 

Therefore, for the next guess, we should use three new letters from the available set for positions 1,2,3? And then E and R at 4 and 5? 

So the word should be: [new1] [new2] [new3] E R

And new1, new2, new3 are from B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? But excluding the ones we already know are absent? But we haven't tested any of these? So all are possible? 

We need to choose a valid English word that fits this pattern? 

Possible words:
- ""LUGER"" -> L U G E R -> valid? Yes? 
- ""FEWER"" -> but that has E at position 2? Which we want to avoid? Because we know E is not at position 2? So if we use ""FEWER"", we have E at position 2? Which we know is wrong? So we would get a '-' for E at position 2? And we already know that? So it doesn't give new information? And we are using one of the positions for E? Which we could have used for a new letter? So not efficient? 

Similarly, ""JEWER""? Not a word? 

""BOXER"" has O? Excluded? 

""BAKER"" has A? Excluded? 

""MAKER"" has M and A? Excluded? 

So let's list words ending with ""ER"" that have three letters from the available set? 

Available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Words:
- ""LUGER"": L, U, G -> all available? 
- ""LIVER"": but I is excluded? I is absent? So no? 
- ""LOWER"": O is excluded? 
- ""DIVER"": I excluded? 
- ""RACER"": A and C excluded? 
- ""FLYER"": F, L, Y -> but Y is available? And ""FLYER"" is a word? But pattern: F L Y E R? So positions: 1:F, 2:L, 3:Y, 4:E, 5:R? 
  But we know E is at position 4? So that's fixed? And R at 5? So yes? 
  But we have to check if F, L, Y are allowed? They are not excluded? So yes? 
- ""FUZER""? Not a word? 
- ""JEWER""? Not a word? 
- ""HEWER"": H, E, W, E, R? But that would be H at 1, E at 2? But we know E is not at position 2? So if we use ""HEWER"", we have E at position 2? Which is invalid? So we get a '-' for E at 2? And we already know? So not good? 
- ""WAGER"": A excluded? 
- ""HOVER"": O excluded? 
- ""LIKER"": I and K? I excluded? 
- ""DOPER"": O excluded? 
- ""GAMER"": A excluded? 
- ""BUYER"": B, U, Y, E, R -> B, U, Y are available? And ""BUYER"" is a word? Pattern: B U Y E R? So positions: 1:B, 2:U, 3:Y, 4:E, 5:R? 
  This seems good? 
- ""LAYER"": A excluded? 
- ""POWER"": O excluded? 
- ""TOTER"": O and T excluded? 
- ""WISER"": I excluded? 
- ""USER"": U, S, E, R? But S is excluded? And also, it's 4 letters? We need 5? ""USER"" is 4? 
- ""USHER"": U, S, H, E, R -> but S excluded? 
- ""FIXER"": I excluded? 
- ""JOKER"": O excluded? 
- ""VOTER"": O and T excluded? 
- ""WAFER"": A excluded? 
- ""WIDER"": I excluded? 
- ""WISER"": I excluded? 
- ""WOMAN"": not ending with ER? 

So possible words from above: 
- ""LUGER"" (L, U, G)
- ""FLYER"" (F, L, Y)
- ""BUYER"" (B, U, Y)

Also, ""JUDGER""? Too long? 6 letters? 

""QUEER"": Q, U, E, E, R -> but we have E at position 3 and 4? But we are putting E at position 3? And we know E is at position 4? So if we put E at position 3, we might get a ✓ or -? But we know E is at position 4? So if we put E at position 3, and if the word has only one E? Then we get a '-' for position 3? But if it has two E's? Then we might get a ✓? But we don't know? Also, ""QUEER"" has Q and U? But Q is available? 

But let's see the pattern: Q U E E R? So positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:E, 4:E, 5:R? But we know position 4 is E? So that's fixed? But position 3 is E? So we are testing E at position 3? Which we haven't tried? But we know E is not at position 2 or 5? But position 3 is possible? 

However, we are using one of the first three positions for E? Instead of a new letter? So it might be less efficient? 

Similarly, ""QUEER"" has two E's? But we don't know if the word has two E's? 

To maximize information, it's better to use three new letters? So I think ""LUGER"", ""FLYER"", or ""BUYER"" are better? 

Among these, which one to choose? 

We can choose based on common letters? But in the available set, common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, L? Vowels: U? 

""LUGER"" has L, U, G? 
""FLYER"" has F, L, Y? 
""BUYER"" has B, U, Y? 

""FLYER"" has Y? Which can be a vowel? 

But we don't know which are more common? 

Since we have limited guesses, we can pick one? 

Another word: ""DUPER""? D, U, P, E, R? But P is excluded? P is absent? So no? 

""HYPER"": H, Y, P, E, R? P excluded? 

""LYCER""? Not a word? 

""JUKER""? Not a word? 

So the three options: ""LUGER"", ""FLYER"", ""BUYER"". 

I think ""BUYER"" is a common word? But let's see: we can also consider ""JUDGE""? Not ending with ER? 

Another: ""HOMER""? O excluded? 

""LUBER""? Not a word? 

So I think we have to choose from the three. 

Let me pick ""FLYER"" because it tests F, L, Y? 

But note: in ""FLYER"", the Y is at position 3? 

We can also consider ""BLUER"": B, L, U, E, R -> but that has E at position 4? And R at 5? And B, L, U? All available? And ""BLUER"" is a word? 

Yes, ""BLUER"" is a valid word? 

So now we have:
- ""LUGER"": L, U, G
- ""FLYER"": F, L, Y
- ""BUYER"": B, U, Y
- ""BLUER"": B, L, U

""BLUER"" uses B, L, U? 

We can choose any? 

But note: we have only 4 guesses left? We are on guess 4? 

We can choose one that covers more common letters? 

Common letters: L, U, B, F? 

I think ""BLUER"" is good? But it has U? 

Alternatively, ""FLYER"" has Y? Which is less common? 

But let's pick ""BLUER"" because it uses B and L? 

But we have to make a guess? 

Another idea: we know the word ends with ""ER"", so we can try to think of common words? 

But with the available letters? 

""EAGER""? A excluded? 

""ELDER""? E at position 1? But we don't know if E can be at position 1? We haven't tried? But we know E is at position 4? So if we put E at position 1, it might be a second E? Or not? 

But in ""ELDER"", we have E at 1 and E at 4? But we are not sure? 

But we are trying to avoid using E? 

So back to the pattern: _ _ _ E R

Let me choose ""BLUER"" as the next guess? 

So guess: ""BLUER""

But ""BLUER"" is B L U E R? 

Positions: 
1: B
2: L
3: U
4: E (which we know is correct? So we expect a ✓ for E? But we are guessing, so we will get feedback? 
5: R (correct? So ✓)

But we are testing B, L, U? 

If the word is ""BLUER"", then we win? 

But if not, we get feedback on B, L, U? 

So it's a good guess? 

Similarly, if we guess ""FLYER"", we test F, L, Y? 

I think ""BLUER"" is fine? 

But let's see the feedback we have: we know E and R are fixed? So we are only guessing the first three? 

So I'll go with ""BLUER"". 

But note: ""BLUER"" has the same structure? 

So <guess>bluer</guess> 

But we must ensure it's a valid word? Yes? 

Alternatively, to cover more letters? But we have to choose one? 

I think it's okay? 

So next guess: ""bluer""
</think>
### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
  - C, A, N: Absent (not in the word).  
  - R: Present but wrong position (not position 2).  
  - E: Present but wrong position (not position 5).  

- **Guess 2: ""merit""**  
  - M, I, T: Absent (not in the word).  
  - E: Present but wrong position (not position 2).  
  - R: Present but wrong position (not position 3).  

- **Guess 3: ""poser""**  
  - P, O, S: Absent (not in the word).  
  - E: Correct position (position 4).  
  - R: Correct position (position 5).  

### Key Insights
1. **Confirmed Letters & Positions**:  
   - **E** is at **position 4**.  
   - **R** is at **position 5**.  
   The secret word pattern is: `_ _ _ E R`.  

2. **Absent Letters**:  
   C, A, N, M, I, T, P, O, S (cannot be in the word).  

3. **Remaining Possible Letters**:  
   B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

4. **Constraints for New Guess**:  
   - Must be a 5-letter word ending in `ER`.  
   - Positions 1–3 must use letters from the remaining pool (avoiding absent letters).  
   - Maximize information by testing new common letters (e.g., B, L, U, F, Y).  

### Strategy for Next Guess
- **Goal**: Test high-frequency consonants (B, L, F) and vowels (U) in positions 1–3.  
- **Ideal Word**: `B L U E R` (""bluer"") fits perfectly:  
  - Tests B (position 1), L (position 2), U (position 3) — all untested letters.  
  - Confirms E (position 4) and R (position 5) are fixed.  
- **Why ""bluer""?**  
  - Valid English word (adjective: more blue).  
  - Covers three new letters efficiently.  
  - If incorrect, feedback will reveal which of B/L/U are present/absent and their positions.  

<guess>bluer</guess>",bluer,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: absent (x)
- R: present but wrong position (-) -> so R is in the word, not at position 2
- A: absent (x)
- N: absent (x)
- E: present but wrong position (-) -> so E is in the word, not at position 5

Guess 2: ""merit""
- M: absent (x)
- E: present but wrong position (-) -> E is not at position 2 (since we tried it at position 2 and got -)
- R: present but wrong position (-) -> R is not at position 3 (since we tried it at position 3 and got -)
- I: absent (x)
- T: absent (x)

Guess 3: ""poser""
- P: absent (x)
- O: absent (x)
- S: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓) -> so E is at position 4
- R: correct position (✓) -> so R is at position 5

So now we know:
- The secret word has E at position 4 and R at position 5.
- The letters that are absent: C, A, N, M, I, T, P, O, S (from the x's in all guesses)
- We also know that R and E are in the word, and we now know their positions: E at 4, R at 5.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: _ _ _ E R

We need to find the first three letters. We know the following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, M, I, T, P, O, S.

We have to choose a word that fits: _ _ _ E R, and uses letters that are not in the excluded list.

Excluded letters: C, A, N, M, I, T, P, O, S.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

We have to make a guess that uses only available letters and fits the pattern.

Let's think of words ending with ""ER"". Common words: 
- like ""TIGER"" but T is excluded? T is absent, so no.
- ""WATER"" but W is available? But A is excluded? A is absent, so no.
- ""PAPER"" but P and A are excluded? No.
- ""LOWER"" but O is excluded? O is absent, so no.

We need to avoid the excluded letters.

Possible words: 
- ""LUGER"": L, U, G, E, R -> but we have E and R fixed? So the word would be ? ? ? E R, so the first three letters are L, U, G? But ""LUGER"" is a word? Yes, meaning a type of pistol or a sled.

Check letters: L, U, G are all in the available set? Yes.

But we have to consider: we don't know if L, U, G are in the word? We are testing them.

Another word: ""JEWEL""? But that ends with L? Not ""ER"". We need ""ER"" at the end.

Another: ""BOXER"" -> B, O, X, E, R -> but O is excluded? O is absent, so no.

Another: ""FEWER"" -> F, E, W, E, R -> but we have two E's? The pattern is _ _ _ E R, so the third letter must be a letter? And we have E at position 4? But ""FEWER"" has E at position 2 and 4? But we don't know if the word has two E's? It might? But in our pattern, we only have one E at position 4? So if we guess ""FEWER"", it would be F at 1, E at 2, W at 3, E at 4, R at 5? But we know E is at position 4? So the E at position 2 would be a new E? But we don't know if the word has two E's? It's possible? But we have to avoid using excluded letters? E is not excluded? But we know E is in the word? But we don't know if it appears twice? However, in the feedback so far, we only have one E? But that doesn't mean it can't be two? So we can try? But let's see: the pattern is fixed for positions 4 and 5: E and R? So the first three are unknown? But in ""FEWER"", the first three are F, E, W? Then E at 4? So the word would be F E W E R? But we are guessing the first three as F, E, W? And then E and R? But we are testing E at position 2? Which we know from guess2 that E is not at position 2? Because in ""merit"", E at position 2 got a '-', meaning E is in the word but not at position 2? So if we put E at position 2 again, it would be incorrect? And we would get a '-' again? But we already know that? So it's a waste? We should avoid putting E in a position we know it's not? So we should not put E at position 2? Similarly, we know E is not at position 5? But we are not putting it there? So for the first three positions, we should not put E? Because we know E is at position 4? And we don't have information about other E's? But we know E is not at position 2? And we haven't tried position 1 or 3? But we can try? However, we are trying to find the first three letters? And we know E is at position 4? So the first three positions are not E? Because if they were E, then we would have multiple E's? But we don't know? So to be safe, we should avoid putting E in the first three? Because we are not sure? But we can use E? But we know that position 2 is invalid for E? So we can put E at position 1 or 3? But if we put E at position 1, then we have E at 1 and E at 4? That's possible? But we don't know? 

But let's reconsider: we have only one E confirmed? But the feedback doesn't tell us the count? So it could be multiple? But to maximize information, we should avoid using E again? Because we already know one E? And we know its position? So we can focus on finding the other letters? So it's better to use three new letters for the first three positions? Without E? Because if we use E, we might not get new information? For example, if we put E at position 1, and if it is present, we get a ✓? But we already know E is in the word? So it doesn't help? And if it's not, we get x? But we know E is in the word? So it must be present? So we would get a '-' if it's not at that position? Or if it is, we get ✓? But we are trying to find the first three? So it might be better to use non-E letters? 

Therefore, for the next guess, we should use three new letters from the available set for positions 1,2,3? And then E and R at 4 and 5? 

So the word should be: [new1] [new2] [new3] E R

And new1, new2, new3 are from B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? But excluding the ones we already know are absent? But we haven't tested any of these? So all are possible? 

We need to choose a valid English word that fits this pattern? 

Possible words:
- ""LUGER"" -> L U G E R -> valid? Yes? 
- ""FEWER"" -> but that has E at position 2? Which we want to avoid? Because we know E is not at position 2? So if we use ""FEWER"", we have E at position 2? Which we know is wrong? So we would get a '-' for E at position 2? And we already know that? So it doesn't give new information? And we are using one of the positions for E? Which we could have used for a new letter? So not efficient? 

Similarly, ""JEWER""? Not a word? 

""BOXER"" has O? Excluded? 

""BAKER"" has A? Excluded? 

""MAKER"" has M and A? Excluded? 

So let's list words ending with ""ER"" that have three letters from the available set? 

Available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Words:
- ""LUGER"": L, U, G -> all available? 
- ""LIVER"": but I is excluded? I is absent? So no? 
- ""LOWER"": O is excluded? 
- ""DIVER"": I excluded? 
- ""RACER"": A and C excluded? 
- ""FLYER"": F, L, Y -> but Y is available? And ""FLYER"" is a word? But pattern: F L Y E R? So positions: 1:F, 2:L, 3:Y, 4:E, 5:R? 
  But we know E is at position 4? So that's fixed? And R at 5? So yes? 
  But we have to check if F, L, Y are allowed? They are not excluded? So yes? 
- ""FUZER""? Not a word? 
- ""JEWER""? Not a word? 
- ""HEWER"": H, E, W, E, R? But that would be H at 1, E at 2? But we know E is not at position 2? So if we use ""HEWER"", we have E at position 2? Which is invalid? So we get a '-' for E at 2? And we already know? So not good? 
- ""WAGER"": A excluded? 
- ""HOVER"": O excluded? 
- ""LIKER"": I and K? I excluded? 
- ""DOPER"": O excluded? 
- ""GAMER"": A excluded? 
- ""BUYER"": B, U, Y, E, R -> B, U, Y are available? And ""BUYER"" is a word? Pattern: B U Y E R? So positions: 1:B, 2:U, 3:Y, 4:E, 5:R? 
  This seems good? 
- ""LAYER"": A excluded? 
- ""POWER"": O excluded? 
- ""TOTER"": O and T excluded? 
- ""WISER"": I excluded? 
- ""USER"": U, S, E, R? But S is excluded? And also, it's 4 letters? We need 5? ""USER"" is 4? 
- ""USHER"": U, S, H, E, R -> but S excluded? 
- ""FIXER"": I excluded? 
- ""JOKER"": O excluded? 
- ""VOTER"": O and T excluded? 
- ""WAFER"": A excluded? 
- ""WIDER"": I excluded? 
- ""WISER"": I excluded? 
- ""WOMAN"": not ending with ER? 

So possible words from above: 
- ""LUGER"" (L, U, G)
- ""FLYER"" (F, L, Y)
- ""BUYER"" (B, U, Y)

Also, ""JUDGER""? Too long? 6 letters? 

""QUEER"": Q, U, E, E, R -> but we have E at position 3 and 4? But we are putting E at position 3? And we know E is at position 4? So if we put E at position 3, we might get a ✓ or -? But we know E is at position 4? So if we put E at position 3, and if the word has only one E? Then we get a '-' for position 3? But if it has two E's? Then we might get a ✓? But we don't know? Also, ""QUEER"" has Q and U? But Q is available? 

But let's see the pattern: Q U E E R? So positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:E, 4:E, 5:R? But we know position 4 is E? So that's fixed? But position 3 is E? So we are testing E at position 3? Which we haven't tried? But we know E is not at position 2 or 5? But position 3 is possible? 

However, we are using one of the first three positions for E? Instead of a new letter? So it might be less efficient? 

Similarly, ""QUEER"" has two E's? But we don't know if the word has two E's? 

To maximize information, it's better to use three new letters? So I think ""LUGER"", ""FLYER"", or ""BUYER"" are better? 

Among these, which one to choose? 

We can choose based on common letters? But in the available set, common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, L? Vowels: U? 

""LUGER"" has L, U, G? 
""FLYER"" has F, L, Y? 
""BUYER"" has B, U, Y? 

""FLYER"" has Y? Which can be a vowel? 

But we don't know which are more common? 

Since we have limited guesses, we can pick one? 

Another word: ""DUPER""? D, U, P, E, R? But P is excluded? P is absent? So no? 

""HYPER"": H, Y, P, E, R? P excluded? 

""LYCER""? Not a word? 

""JUKER""? Not a word? 

So the three options: ""LUGER"", ""FLYER"", ""BUYER"". 

I think ""BUYER"" is a common word? But let's see: we can also consider ""JUDGE""? Not ending with ER? 

Another: ""HOMER""? O excluded? 

""LUBER""? Not a word? 

So I think we have to choose from the three. 

Let me pick ""FLYER"" because it tests F, L, Y? 

But note: in ""FLYER"", the Y is at position 3? 

We can also consider ""BLUER"": B, L, U, E, R -> but that has E at position 4? And R at 5? And B, L, U? All available? And ""BLUER"" is a word? 

Yes, ""BLUER"" is a valid word? 

So now we have:
- ""LUGER"": L, U, G
- ""FLYER"": F, L, Y
- ""BUYER"": B, U, Y
- ""BLUER"": B, L, U

""BLUER"" uses B, L, U? 

We can choose any? 

But note: we have only 4 guesses left? We are on guess 4? 

We can choose one that covers more common letters? 

Common letters: L, U, B, F? 

I think ""BLUER"" is good? But it has U? 

Alternatively, ""FLYER"" has Y? Which is less common? 

But let's pick ""BLUER"" because it uses B and L? 

But we have to make a guess? 

Another idea: we know the word ends with ""ER"", so we can try to think of common words? 

But with the available letters? 

""EAGER""? A excluded? 

""ELDER""? E at position 1? But we don't know if E can be at position 1? We haven't tried? But we know E is at position 4? So if we put E at position 1, it might be a second E? Or not? 

But in ""ELDER"", we have E at 1 and E at 4? But we are not sure? 

But we are trying to avoid using E? 

So back to the pattern: _ _ _ E R

Let me choose ""BLUER"" as the next guess? 

So guess: ""BLUER""

But ""BLUER"" is B L U E R? 

Positions: 
1: B
2: L
3: U
4: E (which we know is correct? So we expect a ✓ for E? But we are guessing, so we will get feedback? 
5: R (correct? So ✓)

But we are testing B, L, U? 

If the word is ""BLUER"", then we win? 

But if not, we get feedback on B, L, U? 

So it's a good guess? 

Similarly, if we guess ""FLYER"", we test F, L, Y? 

I think ""BLUER"" is fine? 

But let's see the feedback we have: we know E and R are fixed? So we are only guessing the first three? 

So I'll go with ""BLUER"". 

But note: ""BLUER"" has the same structure? 

So <guess>bluer</guess> 

But we must ensure it's a valid word? Yes? 

Alternatively, to cover more letters? But we have to choose one? 

I think it's okay? 

So next guess: ""bluer""### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
  - C, A, N: Absent (not in the word).  
  - R: Present but wrong position (not position 2).  
  - E: Present but wrong position (not position 5).  

- **Guess 2: ""merit""**  
  - M, I, T: Absent (not in the word).  
  - E: Present but wrong position (not position 2).  
  - R: Present but wrong position (not position 3).  

- **Guess 3: ""poser""**  
  - P, O, S: Absent (not in the word).  
  - E: Correct position (position 4).  
  - R: Correct position (position 5).  

### Key Insights
1. **Confirmed Letters & Positions**:  
   - **E** is at **position 4**.  
   - **R** is at **position 5**.  
   The secret word pattern is: `_ _ _ E R`.  

2. **Absent Letters**:  
   C, A, N, M, I, T, P, O, S (cannot be in the word).  

3. **Remaining Possible Letters**:  
   B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

4. **Constraints for New Guess**:  
   - Must be a 5-letter word ending in `ER`.  
   - Positions 1–3 must use letters from the remaining pool (avoiding absent letters).  
   - Maximize information by testing new common letters (e.g., B, L, U, F, Y).  

### Strategy for Next Guess
- **Goal**: Test high-frequency consonants (B, L, F) and vowels (U) in positions 1–3.  
- **Ideal Word**: `B L U E R` (""bluer"") fits perfectly:  
  - Tests B (position 1), L (position 2), U (position 3) — all untested letters.  
  - Confirms E (position 4) and R (position 5) are fixed.  
- **Why ""bluer""?**  
  - Valid English word (adjective: more blue).  
  - Covers three new letters efficiently.  
  - If incorrect, feedback will reveal which of B/L/U are present/absent and their positions.",Guess 4: bluer -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(✓) U(x) E(✓) R(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,5,ELDER,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane""
 Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)

 Interpretation:
 - C is not in the secret word (x)
 - R is in the secret word but not in the second position (-)
 - A is not in the secret word (x)
 - N is not in the secret word (x)
 - E is in the secret word but not in the fifth position (-)

 Therefore, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions we guessed (so R is not at position 2, E is not at position 5).
 - The secret word does not contain C, A, or N.

 Since R is in the word but not at position 2, and E is in the word but not at position 5, we need to form a new guess that includes R and E, and excludes C, A, N.

 We should also note that the secret word is 5 letters long.

 For our next guess, we want to try to place R and E in different positions and include other common letters that we haven't tested yet. We avoid using C, A, N.

 Let's think of common letters that can be used. We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We need to form a 5-letter word that has R and E, and avoids C, A, N.

 Also note that in the word ""crane"", the positions were:
 1: C (x)
 2: R (but R is in the word, just not here) -> so R must be in one of the positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? Actually, the feedback only says it's not at position 2. But note, we have a '-' for R at position 2 meaning it is elsewhere.

 Similarly, E is in the word but not at position 5, so E must be at one of the positions 1,2,3,4.

 However, we must also consider that we cannot put R and E in the same positions we already tried? Actually, we can put them in any position except the ones we know they are not. But note: we don't know where they are exactly.

 So, let's choose a word that has:
 - R in a position that is not 2, and E in a position that is not 5.

 Since we have two letters that are confirmed (R and E), we want to maximize information on the other letters.

 Possible words: We can consider words like ""TRIBE"", ""DRIVE"", ""STORE"", etc. But we have to avoid using C, A, N.

 Let me think of words that have R and E and no C, A, N.

 Another idea: We know R is in the word but not at position 2. We can try to put R in position 1? Then E in a different position? Also, we can test more vowels and common consonants.

 One good candidate is ""ROUTE"": 
   R in position 1 (which is a new position for R) 
   E in position 5? But wait, the feedback said E is not in position 5? Actually, we must avoid putting E at position 5 because we know it's not there.

 So let's put E in a position between 1 and 4.

 Alternatively, let me pick a word that places R and E in new positions and uses other common letters.

 Suggestion: ""STRETCH"" is 7 letters, too long. We need 5 letters.

 How about ""STORE"": 
   S, T, O, R, E.
   But note: in ""STORE"", R is in position 4 and E is in position 5. However, we are not allowed to put E at position 5? The feedback from ""crane"" said E is not at position 5? Actually, the feedback was for the fifth letter (E) of ""crane"" being not correct. But it does not mean that E cannot be at position 5? Wait, no: the feedback says the letter E is present in the word but not at that position. So if we put E at position 5 in ""STORE"", it might be that in the secret word E is at position 5? But wait, we know from the first guess that E is not at position 5? Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" says that E is in the word but not at position 5. Therefore, we know that E is in the secret word somewhere else, so if we put E at position 5 now, it must be incorrect? Actually, no: the feedback only told us that in the word ""crane"", the E at position 5 was not the right position. It doesn't forbid E from being at position 5? Well, if the secret word had E at position 5, then when we guessed ""crane"", which has E at position 5, we would have gotten a ✓ for E. But we got a '-' meaning it is present but not at that position. Therefore, we can deduce that E is definitely not at position 5? So we should avoid placing E at position 5 in our new guess? Actually, we can try to put E in a different position to get more information.

 So for ""STORE"":
   Positions: 
      1: S
      2: T
      3: O
      4: R
      5: E   -> but we know E is not at position 5? So this would be incorrect? Actually, we can avoid position 5 for E.

 So let me choose a word with E at positions 1-4.

 Another word: ""TRIED"" -> has E in position 5? No: T, R, I, E, D -> E is at position 4? Actually, ""TRIED"" is T-R-I-E-D: position 1: T, 2: R, 3: I, 4: E, 5: D. 
   But we have R at position 2? And in the first guess we had R at position 2 and it was present but in the wrong position? So wait: the secret word has R but not at position 2. Does that mean R must be in one of the other positions? But when we put R at position 2 again, we would expect a '-' again? Maybe we can use that to see if R is at position 2? But no: we know it's not at position 2? Actually, the feedback told us that R is not at position 2. So if we put R at position 2 again, we would get a '-' again? But we don't learn anything new by putting R in the same wrong position? Moreover, we already know R is in the word, so putting it at position 2 again would only confirm it's still not placed correctly? But we want to try to put R in a different position to hit the correct one.

 So ideally, let's place R in a position that we haven't tried. We have only tried position 2 for R. So we can try R at positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Similarly, we have only tried E at position 5? So we can try E at positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 Therefore, let's choose a word that has R at a position other than 2, and E at a position other than 5.

 Example: ""DRIVE"": 
   D, R, I, V, E
   R is at position 2? Then we would get a '-' for R again? But we want to try a different position for R? So avoid position 2.

 How about ""RODEO""? No, it has E? Actually, no: R, O, D, E, O -> yes, E at position 4.

 But ""RODEO"": 
   R at position 1 -> new position for R? 
   O? 
   D? 
   E at position 4? 
   O? 

 But ""RODEO"" has two O's? And we don't know if the secret word has O? But we can test O and D.

 However, let me think: we haven't been given any information about O and D so they are allowed? And we know we must use R and E and avoid C, A, N.

 So ""RODEO"" is a valid word? But note: the secret word might contain duplicate letters? But in this case, we don't know.

 Alternatively, let's choose a word without duplicate letters? We can get more information.

 Also, let me consider that we have two letters to include: R and E. We need three more.

 Let me try ""RESTY"": 
   R at position 1 (new position), E at position 2 (which hasn't been tried for E because we've only tried E at position 5). 
   S, T, Y? 

 But note: E is at position 2? And we don't know if E can be there? 

 Steps:

 We want to plan:
   Position for R: avoid 2 -> try 1, 3, 4, 5.
   Position for E: avoid 5 -> try 1, 2, 3, 4.

 Also, we want to test as many new letters as possible? Because we have only ruled out C, A, N.

 Let me choose a word that includes common letters: S, T, etc.

 Another candidate: ""RIPES"": 
   R at 1, I, P, E, S? Then E at position 4? S at 5? 

 But ""RIPES"" is a word? Yes.

 However, note that we have two known letters: we are including R and E, and the rest are new (I, P, S).

 How about ""STERN"": 
   S, T, E, R, N? But N is disallowed? We know N is not in the word? We cannot use N.

 So let's avoid forbidden letters: C, A, N? Forbidden letters: C, A, N.

 Therefore, any word that includes C, A, or N is invalid? We should not guess a word with these letters because we know they are not in the secret word.

 So ""STERN"" has N -> invalid.

 Words without C, A, N and that have R and E? And don't put R at position 2? And don't put E at position 5?

 Let me think of common words: 
   ""SERIF"": 
      S, E, R, I, F -> 
        E at position 2? 
        R at position 3? 
        This avoids putting R at position 2 and E at position 5? 
        Positions: 
          1: S
          2: E -> we haven't tried E at position 2? 
          3: R -> we haven't tried R at position 3? 
          4: I
          5: F

   This seems good? 

 Another: ""RESIN"": cannot because it has N? Disallowed.

 Another: ""MERIT"": M, E, R, I, T -> E at 2? R at 3? 

 But we also haven't tested M, I, T? So yes.

 However, note: in ""MERIT"", E is at position 2 and R at position 3? 

 Alternatively, what about ""BEARD"": B, E, A, R, D? But A is disallowed? Cannot use A.

 So let me check: ""TERSE"" -> 
   T, E, R, S, E -> duplicates? 
   But it has E at position 2 and 5? And we know E is not at position 5? So we avoid putting E at 5? 
   But here at position 5: E? So we shouldn't? Actually, we must avoid position 5 for E? But we can test? However, it would likely be inefficient.

 So I prefer ""MERIT"". 

 Steps:
   We'll guess ""MERIT"": 
        M at position 1 (new letter)
        E at position 2 (new position for E? Not position 5)
        R at position 3 (new position for R? Not position 2)
        I at position 4 (new letter)
        T at position 5 (new letter)

 Then we can get feedback on M, E, R, I, T.

 Also, note: if the secret word has E at position 2? Then we'd get a ✓? And similarly for R.

 So let me go with ""MERIT"".

 However, note: the first guess had R at position 2 and we got a '-', meaning R is in the secret word but not at position 2. Now we are putting R at position 3? Similarly, we are putting E at position 2? We don't know if E can be at position 2? It's possible? Because we only know E is not at position 5? 

 Therefore, let's proceed with ""MERIT"".

 Another candidate: ""RULES"": 
   R at position 1, U, L, E, S -> E at position 4? 
   And we avoid forbidden letters. 

 Both ""MERIT"" and ""RULES"" are good? But ""RULES"" uses U and L? Which are less common? Maybe? 

 But ""RULES"" also tests U and L? We don't know? So both are valid.

 However, let me choose ""MERIT"" because it includes T, which is a very common letter? And M, I? 

 So guess ""MERIT"".

 Therefore, my next guess is ""merit"".

<guess>merit</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- C, A, N are **not** in the secret word (all marked ""x"").  
- R is in the word but **not in position 2** (marked ""-"").  
- E is in the word but **not in position 5** (marked ""-"").  

Since R and E are confirmed present, the next guess must:  
1. Include R and E.  
2. Avoid C, A, N.  
3. Place R in a new position (not 2).  
4. Place E in a new position (not 5).  

The word ""merit"" meets these criteria:  
- Positions R (3rd) and E (2nd) differ from the first guess.  
- Tests new common letters (M, I, T) while excluding C, A, N.  

This maximizes information gain about letter placements and additional letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: merit -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(-) R(-) I(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>Okay, let me analyze the feedback we've received so far to make the next guess. 

First, the information from both guesses:

From Guess 1 (""crane""):
- C, A, N not in word
- R present but not position 2
- E present but not position 5

From Guess 2 (""merit""):
- M not in word (x)
- E present but not position 2 (-) → confirms E not position 5 or 2
- R present but not position 3 (-) → confirms R not position 2 or 3
- I not in word (x)
- T not in word (x)

Now we know:
✅ Present letters: R, E
⛔ Absent letters: C, A, N, M, I, T

Position constraints:
- R cannot be position 2 or 3
- E cannot be position 2 or 5

Available letters: Must include R and E, avoid C/A/N/M/I/T. That leaves lots of options: B,D,F,G,H,K,O,P,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z,and maybe others.

Given R must be in positions 1,4 or 5 (since 2/3 excluded), and E must be in positions 1,3 or 4 (since 2/5 excluded).

Possible word pattern: 5 letters including R and E, using only unused consonants/vowels.

Need to maximize information: Should test new common letters like S,D,O,L etc.

Considering words:
- ""RODEO"" → contains O/D/E/R? But O repeated and we don't know if duplicates allowed. Also E position? Wait: R-O-D-E-O → positions: R(1), O(2), D(3), E(4), O(5). E position 4 → allowed. But ""O"" appears twice - if secret word has only one O, we might get false feedback? Avoid for now? But it's possible.

Better options? Trying:
- ""POSER"": P-O-S-E-R → has S,P,O,R,E. Positions: E at 4? R at 5? Both new positions. Tests P,O,S.
- Checks: R at position 5 (new), E at 4 (new). No conflicting letters. That could be good.

Another option: ""LOSER"". But L not tested? We get ""L"" info? Actually same structure: L-O-S-E-R → E at 4, R at 5.

But note: We only have 6 total guesses. We used 2, have 4 left? Since we're on guess 3.

But wait: feedback for ""merit"" showed E(-) at position 2 - that means E exists elsewhere? So yes, E is in word but not at position 2. Similarly R not at position 2 or 3? So we are narrowing down? We know R must be at pos 1,4,5 and E at pos 1,3,4? Since E cannot be at position 2 or 5? And R cannot be at 2 or 3?

Also, secret word has these two letters still? We haven't placed them? So we need to focus on placing R and E? Also, the word has 5 letters? We know two letters? The other three letters are unknown? And not among the excluded letters? So a lot possible? Better to choose a word with more new letters? So ""POSER"" tests P O S? But note, we haven't tested these? So they could be in or out? Good to test.

But also possible: ""FORES"". F-O-R-E-S → R at position 3 → which was excluded? Because from ""merit"", R cannot be at position 3? So we must not put R at position 3? ""FORES"" has R at position 3 → invalid? Because we know R not at position 3? So cannot test words putting R in known wrong positions? So ""FORES"" invalid? Similarly, we cannot put E in position 2 or 5? Or R in 2 or 3? So ""POSER"": R at position 5? Which is new? And E at position 4? Also new? So that works.

Another possibility: ""ROUGH"". But no E? Must include E? So invalid.

Alternative word: ""OILER"" → but I not in word? And we have I excluded? So invalid? Because I is absent? Cannot use I? So discard.

Any better? ""POWER"" → no E? Wait, has E? P-O-W-E-R? E at 4? R at 5? And includes W? But ""POWER"" is five letters? Positions: P(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), R(5)? That seems good? But does it have any known absent letters? C,A,N,M,I,T - none used? So valid? Plus tests P,O,W? 

But compare to ""POSER"": also tests P,O,S? S is more common? Maybe better? Alternatively, ""POSER"" also has S? Which is common? Maybe ""POSER"" better? But ""POWER"" includes W? Which is less common? So perhaps ""POSER"" better?

But note: ""POSER"" has S? Could test S? While ""POWER"" tests W? I think S is more frequent? So prefer ""POSER""? Or ""ROUSE"" → R-O-U-S-E → R at pos1? O at2? U at3? S at4? E at5 → but E at5 not allowed? Because we know E not at position 5? So cannot use position 5 for E? So discard.

Thus ""POSER"": E at position 4? Which is new? R at position 5? New? So positions: 
- Position 1: P? New? 
- Position 2: O? New? 
- Position 3: S? New? 
- Position 4: E → attempting E at position 4? Which is an allowed position? 
- Position 5: R → attempting R at position 5? Which is allowed? 

Plus tests new letters P,O,S? Which are common? 

So let's go with ""POSER"".

In summary: 
- Previous constraints handled? 
- Includes R and E? In new positions? 
- Uses all new letters? 
- Avoids forbidden letters? Yes?Based on the feedback:

**Feedback Analysis**
1. **New Absent Letters**: M, I, T (so far: C, A, N, M, I, T excluded)
2. **Confirmed Presence**: 
   - R is in the secret word but now confirmed *not at positions 2 or 3* (received ""-"" in both guesses). 
   - E is in the secret word but confirmed *not at positions 2 or 5* (received ""-"" in both guesses).
3. **Position Constraints**:
   - R can only be at positions 1, 4, or 5.
   - E can only be at positions 1, 3, or 4.

**Next Guess Strategy**
- Must include **R and E**, exclude C/A/N/M/I/T.
- Prioritize **new common consonants/vowels**: S, O, D, L, P (untested).
- Place R/E in **new valid positions**: E at 3/4? R at 1/4/5?
- Ideal word structure: Tests 3 new letters + R/E?  
- Top candidate: **""POSER""**  
  - P (new), O (new), S (new), E (position 4? new slot), R (position 5? new slot)  
  - Tests E at pos 4? R at pos 5? Maximizes coverage of S/O/P?

<guess>poser</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: merit -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(-) R(-) I(x) T(x)
Guess 3: poser -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: absent (x)
- R: present but wrong position (-) -> so R is in the word, not at position 2
- A: absent (x)
- N: absent (x)
- E: present but wrong position (-) -> so E is in the word, not at position 5

Guess 2: ""merit""
- M: absent (x)
- E: present but wrong position (-) -> E is not at position 2 (since we tried it at position 2 and got -)
- R: present but wrong position (-) -> R is not at position 3 (since we tried it at position 3 and got -)
- I: absent (x)
- T: absent (x)

Guess 3: ""poser""
- P: absent (x)
- O: absent (x)
- S: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓) -> so E is at position 4
- R: correct position (✓) -> so R is at position 5

So now we know:
- The secret word has E at position 4 and R at position 5.
- The letters that are absent: C, A, N, M, I, T, P, O, S (from the x's in all guesses)
- We also know that R and E are in the word, and we now know their positions: E at 4, R at 5.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: _ _ _ E R

We need to find the first three letters. We know the following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, M, I, T, P, O, S.

We have to choose a word that fits: _ _ _ E R, and uses letters that are not in the excluded list.

Excluded letters: C, A, N, M, I, T, P, O, S.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

We have to make a guess that uses only available letters and fits the pattern.

Let's think of words ending with ""ER"". Common words: 
- like ""TIGER"" but T is excluded? T is absent, so no.
- ""WATER"" but W is available? But A is excluded? A is absent, so no.
- ""PAPER"" but P and A are excluded? No.
- ""LOWER"" but O is excluded? O is absent, so no.

We need to avoid the excluded letters.

Possible words: 
- ""LUGER"": L, U, G, E, R -> but we have E and R fixed? So the word would be ? ? ? E R, so the first three letters are L, U, G? But ""LUGER"" is a word? Yes, meaning a type of pistol or a sled.

Check letters: L, U, G are all in the available set? Yes.

But we have to consider: we don't know if L, U, G are in the word? We are testing them.

Another word: ""JEWEL""? But that ends with L? Not ""ER"". We need ""ER"" at the end.

Another: ""BOXER"" -> B, O, X, E, R -> but O is excluded? O is absent, so no.

Another: ""FEWER"" -> F, E, W, E, R -> but we have two E's? The pattern is _ _ _ E R, so the third letter must be a letter? And we have E at position 4? But ""FEWER"" has E at position 2 and 4? But we don't know if the word has two E's? It might? But in our pattern, we only have one E at position 4? So if we guess ""FEWER"", it would be F at 1, E at 2, W at 3, E at 4, R at 5? But we know E is at position 4? So the E at position 2 would be a new E? But we don't know if the word has two E's? It's possible? But we have to avoid using excluded letters? E is not excluded? But we know E is in the word? But we don't know if it appears twice? However, in the feedback so far, we only have one E? But that doesn't mean it can't be two? So we can try? But let's see: the pattern is fixed for positions 4 and 5: E and R? So the first three are unknown? But in ""FEWER"", the first three are F, E, W? Then E at 4? So the word would be F E W E R? But we are guessing the first three as F, E, W? And then E and R? But we are testing E at position 2? Which we know from guess2 that E is not at position 2? Because in ""merit"", E at position 2 got a '-', meaning E is in the word but not at position 2? So if we put E at position 2 again, it would be incorrect? And we would get a '-' again? But we already know that? So it's a waste? We should avoid putting E in a position we know it's not? So we should not put E at position 2? Similarly, we know E is not at position 5? But we are not putting it there? So for the first three positions, we should not put E? Because we know E is at position 4? And we don't have information about other E's? But we know E is not at position 2? And we haven't tried position 1 or 3? But we can try? However, we are trying to find the first three letters? And we know E is at position 4? So the first three positions are not E? Because if they were E, then we would have multiple E's? But we don't know? So to be safe, we should avoid putting E in the first three? Because we are not sure? But we can use E? But we know that position 2 is invalid for E? So we can put E at position 1 or 3? But if we put E at position 1, then we have E at 1 and E at 4? That's possible? But we don't know? 

But let's reconsider: we have only one E confirmed? But the feedback doesn't tell us the count? So it could be multiple? But to maximize information, we should avoid using E again? Because we already know one E? And we know its position? So we can focus on finding the other letters? So it's better to use three new letters for the first three positions? Without E? Because if we use E, we might not get new information? For example, if we put E at position 1, and if it is present, we get a ✓? But we already know E is in the word? So it doesn't help? And if it's not, we get x? But we know E is in the word? So it must be present? So we would get a '-' if it's not at that position? Or if it is, we get ✓? But we are trying to find the first three? So it might be better to use non-E letters? 

Therefore, for the next guess, we should use three new letters from the available set for positions 1,2,3? And then E and R at 4 and 5? 

So the word should be: [new1] [new2] [new3] E R

And new1, new2, new3 are from B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? But excluding the ones we already know are absent? But we haven't tested any of these? So all are possible? 

We need to choose a valid English word that fits this pattern? 

Possible words:
- ""LUGER"" -> L U G E R -> valid? Yes? 
- ""FEWER"" -> but that has E at position 2? Which we want to avoid? Because we know E is not at position 2? So if we use ""FEWER"", we have E at position 2? Which we know is wrong? So we would get a '-' for E at position 2? And we already know that? So it doesn't give new information? And we are using one of the positions for E? Which we could have used for a new letter? So not efficient? 

Similarly, ""JEWER""? Not a word? 

""BOXER"" has O? Excluded? 

""BAKER"" has A? Excluded? 

""MAKER"" has M and A? Excluded? 

So let's list words ending with ""ER"" that have three letters from the available set? 

Available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Words:
- ""LUGER"": L, U, G -> all available? 
- ""LIVER"": but I is excluded? I is absent? So no? 
- ""LOWER"": O is excluded? 
- ""DIVER"": I excluded? 
- ""RACER"": A and C excluded? 
- ""FLYER"": F, L, Y -> but Y is available? And ""FLYER"" is a word? But pattern: F L Y E R? So positions: 1:F, 2:L, 3:Y, 4:E, 5:R? 
  But we know E is at position 4? So that's fixed? And R at 5? So yes? 
  But we have to check if F, L, Y are allowed? They are not excluded? So yes? 
- ""FUZER""? Not a word? 
- ""JEWER""? Not a word? 
- ""HEWER"": H, E, W, E, R? But that would be H at 1, E at 2? But we know E is not at position 2? So if we use ""HEWER"", we have E at position 2? Which is invalid? So we get a '-' for E at 2? And we already know? So not good? 
- ""WAGER"": A excluded? 
- ""HOVER"": O excluded? 
- ""LIKER"": I and K? I excluded? 
- ""DOPER"": O excluded? 
- ""GAMER"": A excluded? 
- ""BUYER"": B, U, Y, E, R -> B, U, Y are available? And ""BUYER"" is a word? Pattern: B U Y E R? So positions: 1:B, 2:U, 3:Y, 4:E, 5:R? 
  This seems good? 
- ""LAYER"": A excluded? 
- ""POWER"": O excluded? 
- ""TOTER"": O and T excluded? 
- ""WISER"": I excluded? 
- ""USER"": U, S, E, R? But S is excluded? And also, it's 4 letters? We need 5? ""USER"" is 4? 
- ""USHER"": U, S, H, E, R -> but S excluded? 
- ""FIXER"": I excluded? 
- ""JOKER"": O excluded? 
- ""VOTER"": O and T excluded? 
- ""WAFER"": A excluded? 
- ""WIDER"": I excluded? 
- ""WISER"": I excluded? 
- ""WOMAN"": not ending with ER? 

So possible words from above: 
- ""LUGER"" (L, U, G)
- ""FLYER"" (F, L, Y)
- ""BUYER"" (B, U, Y)

Also, ""JUDGER""? Too long? 6 letters? 

""QUEER"": Q, U, E, E, R -> but we have E at position 3 and 4? But we are putting E at position 3? And we know E is at position 4? So if we put E at position 3, we might get a ✓ or -? But we know E is at position 4? So if we put E at position 3, and if the word has only one E? Then we get a '-' for position 3? But if it has two E's? Then we might get a ✓? But we don't know? Also, ""QUEER"" has Q and U? But Q is available? 

But let's see the pattern: Q U E E R? So positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:E, 4:E, 5:R? But we know position 4 is E? So that's fixed? But position 3 is E? So we are testing E at position 3? Which we haven't tried? But we know E is not at position 2 or 5? But position 3 is possible? 

However, we are using one of the first three positions for E? Instead of a new letter? So it might be less efficient? 

Similarly, ""QUEER"" has two E's? But we don't know if the word has two E's? 

To maximize information, it's better to use three new letters? So I think ""LUGER"", ""FLYER"", or ""BUYER"" are better? 

Among these, which one to choose? 

We can choose based on common letters? But in the available set, common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, L? Vowels: U? 

""LUGER"" has L, U, G? 
""FLYER"" has F, L, Y? 
""BUYER"" has B, U, Y? 

""FLYER"" has Y? Which can be a vowel? 

But we don't know which are more common? 

Since we have limited guesses, we can pick one? 

Another word: ""DUPER""? D, U, P, E, R? But P is excluded? P is absent? So no? 

""HYPER"": H, Y, P, E, R? P excluded? 

""LYCER""? Not a word? 

""JUKER""? Not a word? 

So the three options: ""LUGER"", ""FLYER"", ""BUYER"". 

I think ""BUYER"" is a common word? But let's see: we can also consider ""JUDGE""? Not ending with ER? 

Another: ""HOMER""? O excluded? 

""LUBER""? Not a word? 

So I think we have to choose from the three. 

Let me pick ""FLYER"" because it tests F, L, Y? 

But note: in ""FLYER"", the Y is at position 3? 

We can also consider ""BLUER"": B, L, U, E, R -> but that has E at position 4? And R at 5? And B, L, U? All available? And ""BLUER"" is a word? 

Yes, ""BLUER"" is a valid word? 

So now we have:
- ""LUGER"": L, U, G
- ""FLYER"": F, L, Y
- ""BUYER"": B, U, Y
- ""BLUER"": B, L, U

""BLUER"" uses B, L, U? 

We can choose any? 

But note: we have only 4 guesses left? We are on guess 4? 

We can choose one that covers more common letters? 

Common letters: L, U, B, F? 

I think ""BLUER"" is good? But it has U? 

Alternatively, ""FLYER"" has Y? Which is less common? 

But let's pick ""BLUER"" because it uses B and L? 

But we have to make a guess? 

Another idea: we know the word ends with ""ER"", so we can try to think of common words? 

But with the available letters? 

""EAGER""? A excluded? 

""ELDER""? E at position 1? But we don't know if E can be at position 1? We haven't tried? But we know E is at position 4? So if we put E at position 1, it might be a second E? Or not? 

But in ""ELDER"", we have E at 1 and E at 4? But we are not sure? 

But we are trying to avoid using E? 

So back to the pattern: _ _ _ E R

Let me choose ""BLUER"" as the next guess? 

So guess: ""BLUER""

But ""BLUER"" is B L U E R? 

Positions: 
1: B
2: L
3: U
4: E (which we know is correct? So we expect a ✓ for E? But we are guessing, so we will get feedback? 
5: R (correct? So ✓)

But we are testing B, L, U? 

If the word is ""BLUER"", then we win? 

But if not, we get feedback on B, L, U? 

So it's a good guess? 

Similarly, if we guess ""FLYER"", we test F, L, Y? 

I think ""BLUER"" is fine? 

But let's see the feedback we have: we know E and R are fixed? So we are only guessing the first three? 

So I'll go with ""BLUER"". 

But note: ""BLUER"" has the same structure? 

So <guess>bluer</guess> 

But we must ensure it's a valid word? Yes? 

Alternatively, to cover more letters? But we have to choose one? 

I think it's okay? 

So next guess: ""bluer""### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
  - C, A, N: Absent (not in the word).  
  - R: Present but wrong position (not position 2).  
  - E: Present but wrong position (not position 5).  

- **Guess 2: ""merit""**  
  - M, I, T: Absent (not in the word).  
  - E: Present but wrong position (not position 2).  
  - R: Present but wrong position (not position 3).  

- **Guess 3: ""poser""**  
  - P, O, S: Absent (not in the word).  
  - E: Correct position (position 4).  
  - R: Correct position (position 5).  

### Key Insights
1. **Confirmed Letters & Positions**:  
   - **E** is at **position 4**.  
   - **R** is at **position 5**.  
   The secret word pattern is: `_ _ _ E R`.  

2. **Absent Letters**:  
   C, A, N, M, I, T, P, O, S (cannot be in the word).  

3. **Remaining Possible Letters**:  
   B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

4. **Constraints for New Guess**:  
   - Must be a 5-letter word ending in `ER`.  
   - Positions 1–3 must use letters from the remaining pool (avoiding absent letters).  
   - Maximize information by testing new common letters (e.g., B, L, U, F, Y).  

### Strategy for Next Guess
- **Goal**: Test high-frequency consonants (B, L, F) and vowels (U) in positions 1–3.  
- **Ideal Word**: `B L U E R` (""bluer"") fits perfectly:  
  - Tests B (position 1), L (position 2), U (position 3) — all untested letters.  
  - Confirms E (position 4) and R (position 5) are fixed.  
- **Why ""bluer""?**  
  - Valid English word (adjective: more blue).  
  - Covers three new letters efficiently.  
  - If incorrect, feedback will reveal which of B/L/U are present/absent and their positions.

We haven\'t tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n We need to form a 5-letter word that has R and E, and avoids C, A, N.\n\n Also note that in the word ""crane"", the positions were:\n 1: C (x)\n 2: R (but R is in the word, just not here) -> so R must be in one of the positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? Actually, the feedback only says it\'s not at position 2. But note, we have a \'-\' for R at position 2 meaning it is elsewhere.\n\n Similarly, E is in the word but not at position 5, so E must be at one of the positions 1,2,3,4.\n\n However, we must also consider that we cannot put R and E in the same positions we already tried? Actually, we can put them in any position except the ones we know they are not. But note: we don\'t know where they are exactly.\n\n So, let\'s choose a word that has:\n - R in a position that is not 2, and E in a position that is not 5.\n\n Since we have two letters that are confirmed (R and E), we want to maximize information on the other letters.\n\n Possible words: We can consider words like ""TRIBE"", ""DRIVE"", ""STORE"", etc. But we have to avoid using C, A, N.\n\n Let me think of words that have R and E and no C, A, N.\n\n Another idea: We know R is in the word but not at position 2. We can try to put R in position 1? Then E in a different position? Also, we can test more vowels and common consonants.\n\n One good candidate is ""ROUTE"": \n   R in position 1 (which is a new position for R) \n   E in position 5? But wait, the feedback said E is not in position 5? Actually, we must avoid putting E at position 5 because we know it\'s not there.\n\n So let\'s put E in a position between 1 and 4.\n\n Alternatively, let me pick a word that places R and E in new positions and uses other common letters.\n\n Suggestion: ""STRETCH"" is 7 letters, too long. We need 5 letters.\n\n How about ""STORE"": \n   S, T, O, R, E.\n   But note: in ""STORE"", R is in position 4 and E is in position 5. However, we are not allowed to put E at position 5? The feedback from ""crane"" said E is not at position 5? Actually, the feedback was for the fifth letter (E) of ""crane"" being not correct. But it does not mean that E cannot be at position 5? Wait, no: the feedback says the letter E is present in the word but not at that position. So if we put E at position 5 in ""STORE"", it might be that in the secret word E is at position 5? But wait, we know from the first guess that E is not at position 5? Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" says that E is in the word but not at position 5. Therefore, we know that E is in the secret word somewhere else, so if we put E at position 5 now, it must be incorrect? Actually, no: the feedback only told us that in the word ""crane"", the E at position 5 was not the right position. It doesn\'t forbid E from being at position 5? Well, if the secret word had E at position 5, then when we guessed ""crane"", which has E at position 5, we would have gotten a ✓ for E. But we got a \'-\' meaning it is present but not at that position. Therefore, we can deduce that E is definitely not at position 5? So we should avoid placing E at position 5 in our new guess? Actually, we can try to put E in a different position to get more information.\n\n So for ""STORE"":\n   Positions: \n      1: S\n      2: T\n      3: O\n      4: R\n      5: E   -> but we know E is not at position 5? So this would be incorrect? Actually, we can avoid position 5 for E.\n\n So let me choose a word with E at positions 1-4.\n\n Another word: ""TRIED"" -> has E in position 5? No: T, R, I, E, D -> E is at position 4? Actually, ""TRIED"" is T-R-I-E-D: position 1: T, 2: R, 3: I, 4: E, 5: D. \n   But we have R at position 2? And in the first guess we had R at position 2 and it was present but in the wrong position? So wait: the secret word has R but not at position 2. Does that mean R must be in one of the other positions? But when we put R at position 2 again, we would expect a \'-\' again? Maybe we can use that to see if R is at position 2? But no: we know it\'s not at position 2? Actually, the feedback told us that R is not at position 2. So if we put R at position 2 again, we would get a \'-\' again? But we don\'t learn anything new by putting R in the same wrong position? Moreover, we already know R is in the word, so putting it at position 2 again would only confirm it\'s still not placed correctly? But we want to try to put R in a different position to hit the correct one.\n\n So ideally, let\'s place R in a position that we haven\'t tried. We have only tried position 2 for R. So we can try R at positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\n Similarly, we have only tried E at position 5? So we can try E at positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n Therefore, let\'s choose a word that has R at a position other than 2, and E at a position other than 5.\n\n Example: ""DRIVE"": \n   D, R, I, V, E\n   R is at position 2? Then we would get a \'-\' for R again? But we want to try a different position for R? So avoid position 2.\n\n How about ""RODEO""? No, it has E? Actually, no: R, O, D, E, O -> yes, E at position 4.\n\n But ""RODEO"": \n   R at position 1 -> new position for R? \n   O? \n   D? \n   E at position 4? \n   O? \n\n But ""RODEO"" has two O\'s? And we don\'t know if the secret word has O? But we can test O and D.\n\n However, let me think: we haven\'t been given any information about O and D so they are allowed? And we know we must use R and E and avoid C, A, N.\n\n So ""RODEO"" is a valid word? But note: the secret word might contain duplicate letters? But in this case, we don\'t know.\n\n Alternatively, let\'s choose a word without duplicate letters? We can get more information.\n\n Also, let me consider that we have two letters to include: R and E. We need three more.\n\n Let me try ""RESTY"": \n   R at position 1 (new position), E at position 2 (which hasn\'t been tried for E because we\'ve only tried E at position 5). \n   S, T, Y? \n\n But note: E is at position 2? And we don\'t know if E can be there? \n\n Steps:\n\n We want to plan:\n   Position for R: avoid 2 -> try 1, 3, 4, 5.\n   Position for E: avoid 5 -> try 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\n Also, we want to test as many new letters as possible? Because we have only ruled out C, A, N.\n\n Let me choose a word that includes common letters: S, T, etc.\n\n Another candidate: ""RIPES"": \n   R at 1, I, P, E, S? Then E at position 4? S at 5? \n\n But ""RIPES"" is a word? Yes.\n\n However, note that we have two known letters: we are including R and E, and the rest are new (I, P, S).\n\n How about ""STERN"": \n   S, T, E, R, N? But N is disallowed? We know N is not in the word? We cannot use N.\n\n So let\'s avoid forbidden letters: C, A, N? Forbidden letters: C, A, N.\n\n Therefore, any word that includes C, A, or N is invalid? We should not guess a word with these letters because we know they are not in the secret word.\n\n So ""STERN"" has N -> invalid.\n\n Words without C, A, N and that have R and E? And don\'t put R at position 2? And don\'t put E at position 5?\n\n Let me think of common words: \n   ""SERIF"": \n      S, E, R, I, F -> \n        E at position 2? \n        R at position 3? \n        This avoids putting R at position 2 and E at position 5? \n        Positions: \n          1: S\n          2: E -> we haven\'t tried E at position 2? \n          3: R -> we haven\'t tried R at position 3? \n          4: I\n          5: F\n\n   This seems good? \n\n Another: ""RESIN"": cannot because it has N? Disallowed.\n\n Another: ""MERIT"": M, E, R, I, T -> E at 2? R at 3? \n\n But we also haven\'t tested M, I, T? So yes.\n\n However, note: in ""MERIT"", E is at position 2 and R at position 3? \n\n Alternatively, what about ""BEARD"": B, E, A, R, D? But A is disallowed? Cannot use A.\n\n So let me check: ""TERSE"" -> \n   T, E, R, S, E -> duplicates? \n   But it has E at position 2 and 5? And we know E is not at position 5? So we avoid putting E at 5? \n   But here at position 5: E? So we shouldn\'t? Actually, we must avoid position 5 for E? But we can test? However, it would likely be inefficient.\n\n So I prefer ""MERIT"". \n\n Steps:\n   We\'ll guess ""MERIT"": \n        M at position 1 (new letter)\n        E at position 2 (new position for E? Not position 5)\n        R at position 3 (new position for R? Not position 2)\n        I at position 4 (new letter)\n        T at position 5 (new letter)\n\n Then we can get feedback on M, E, R, I, T.\n\n Also, note: if the secret word has E at position 2? Then we\'d get a ✓? And similarly for R.\n\n So let me go with ""MERIT"".\n\n However, note: the first guess had R at position 2 and we got a \'-\', meaning R is in the secret word but not at position 2. Now we are putting R at position 3? Similarly, we are putting E at position 2? We don\'t know if E can be at position 2? It\'s possible? Because we only know E is not at position 5? \n\n Therefore, let\'s proceed with ""MERIT"".\n\n Another candidate: ""RULES"": \n   R at position 1, U, L, E, S -> E at position 4? \n   And we avoid forbidden letters. \n\n Both ""MERIT"" and ""RULES"" are good? But ""RULES"" uses U and L? Which are less common? Maybe? \n\n But ""RULES"" also tests U and L? We don\'t know? So both are valid.\n\n However, let me choose ""MERIT"" because it includes T, which is a very common letter? And M, I? \n\n So guess ""MERIT"".\n\n Therefore, my next guess is ""merit"".\n\n<guess>merit</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  \n- C, A, N are **not** in the secret word (all marked ""x"").  \n- R is in the word but **not in position 2** (marked ""-"").  \n- E is in the word but **not in position 5** (marked ""-"").  \n\nSince R and E are confirmed present, the next guess must:  \n1. Include R and E.  \n2. Avoid C, A, N.  \n3. Place R in a new position (not 2).  \n4. Place E in a new position (not 5).  \n\nThe word ""merit"" meets these criteria:  \n- Positions R (3rd) and E (2nd) differ from the first guess.  \n- Tests new common letters (M, I, T) while excluding C, A, N.  \n\nThis maximizes information gain about letter placements and additional letters.\n\n<guess>merit</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: merit -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(-) R(-) I(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Okay, let me analyze the feedback we\'ve received so far to make the next guess. \n\nFirst, the information from both guesses:\n\nFrom Guess 1 (""crane""):\n- C, A, N not in word\n- R present but not position 2\n- E present but not position 5\n\nFrom Guess 2 (""merit""):\n- M not in word (x)\n- E present but not position 2 (-) → confirms E not position 5 or 2\n- R present but not position 3 (-) → confirms R not position 2 or 3\n- I not in word (x)\n- T not in word (x)\n\nNow we know:\n✅ Present letters: R, E\n⛔ Absent letters: C, A, N, M, I, T\n\nPosition constraints:\n- R cannot be position 2 or 3\n- E cannot be position 2 or 5\n\nAvailable letters: Must include R and E, avoid C/A/N/M/I/T. That leaves lots of options: B,D,F,G,H,K,O,P,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z,and maybe others.\n\nGiven R must be in positions 1,4 or 5 (since 2/3 excluded), and E must be in positions 1,3 or 4 (since 2/5 excluded).\n\nPossible word pattern: 5 letters including R and E, using only unused consonants/vowels.\n\nNeed to maximize information: Should test new common letters like S,D,O,L etc.\n\nConsidering words:\n- ""RODEO"" → contains O/D/E/R? But O repeated and we don\'t know if duplicates allowed. Also E position? Wait: R-O-D-E-O → positions: R(1), O(2), D(3), E(4), O(5). E position 4 → allowed. But ""O"" appears twice - if secret word has only one O, we might get false feedback? Avoid for now? But it\'s possible.\n\nBetter options? Trying:\n- ""POSER"": P-O-S-E-R → has S,P,O,R,E. Positions: E at 4? R at 5? Both new positions. Tests P,O,S.\n- Checks: R at position 5 (new), E at 4 (new). No conflicting letters. That could be good.\n\nAnother option: ""LOSER"". But L not tested? We get ""L"" info? Actually same structure: L-O-S-E-R → E at 4, R at 5.\n\nBut note: We only have 6 total guesses. We used 2, have 4 left? Since we\'re on guess 3.\n\nBut wait: feedback for ""merit"" showed E(-) at position 2 - that means E exists elsewhere? So yes, E is in word but not at position 2. Similarly R not at position 2 or 3? So we are narrowing down? We know R must be at pos 1,4,5 and E at pos 1,3,4? Since E cannot be at position 2 or 5? And R cannot be at 2 or 3?\n\nAlso, secret word has these two letters still? We haven\'t placed them? So we need to focus on placing R and E? Also, the word has 5 letters? We know two letters? The other three letters are unknown? And not among the excluded letters? So a lot possible? Better to choose a word with more new letters? So ""POSER"" tests P O S? But note, we haven\'t tested these? So they could be in or out? Good to test.\n\nBut also possible: ""FORES"". F-O-R-E-S → R at position 3 → which was excluded? Because from ""merit"", R cannot be at position 3? So we must not put R at position 3? ""FORES"" has R at position 3 → invalid? Because we know R not at position 3? So cannot test words putting R in known wrong positions? So ""FORES"" invalid? Similarly, we cannot put E in position 2 or 5? Or R in 2 or 3? So ""POSER"": R at position 5? Which is new? And E at position 4? Also new? So that works.\n\nAnother possibility: ""ROUGH"". But no E? Must include E? So invalid.\n\nAlternative word: ""OILER"" → but I not in word? And we have I excluded? So invalid? Because I is absent? Cannot use I? So discard.\n\nAny better? ""POWER"" → no E? Wait, has E? P-O-W-E-R? E at 4? R at 5? And includes W? But ""POWER"" is five letters? Positions: P(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), R(5)? That seems good? But does it have any known absent letters? C,A,N,M,I,T - none used? So valid? Plus tests P,O,W? \n\nBut compare to ""POSER"": also tests P,O,S? S is more common? Maybe better? Alternatively, ""POSER"" also has S? Which is common? Maybe ""POSER"" better? But ""POWER"" includes W? Which is less common? So perhaps ""POSER"" better?\n\nBut note: ""POSER"" has S? Could test S? While ""POWER"" tests W? I think S is more frequent? So prefer ""POSER""? Or ""ROUSE"" → R-O-U-S-E → R at pos1? O at2? U at3? S at4? E at5 → but E at5 not allowed? Because we know E not at position 5? So cannot use position 5 for E? So discard.\n\nThus ""POSER"": E at position 4? Which is new? R at position 5? New? So positions: \n- Position 1: P? New? \n- Position 2: O? New? \n- Position 3: S? New? \n- Position 4: E → attempting E at position 4? Which is an allowed position? \n- Position 5: R → attempting R at position 5? Which is allowed? \n\nPlus tests new letters P,O,S? Which are common? \n\nSo let\'s go with ""POSER"".\n\nIn summary: \n- Previous constraints handled? \n- Includes R and E? In new positions? \n- Uses all new letters? \n- Avoids forbidden letters? Yes?Based on the feedback:\n\n**Feedback Analysis**\n1. **New Absent Letters**: M, I, T (so far: C, A, N, M, I, T excluded)\n2. **Confirmed Presence**: \n   - R is in the secret word but now confirmed *not at positions 2 or 3* (received ""-"" in both guesses). \n   - E is in the secret word but confirmed *not at positions 2 or 5* (received ""-"" in both guesses).\n3. **Position Constraints**:\n   - R can only be at positions 1, 4, or 5.\n   - E can only be at positions 1, 3, or 4.\n\n**Next Guess Strategy**\n- Must include **R and E**, exclude C/A/N/M/I/T.\n- Prioritize **new common consonants/vowels**: S, O, D, L, P (untested).\n- Place R/E in **new valid positions**: E at 3/4? R at 1/4/5?\n- Ideal word structure: Tests 3 new letters + R/E?  \n- Top candidate: **""POSER""**  \n  - P (new), O (new), S (new), E (position 4? new slot), R (position 5? new slot)  \n  - Tests E at pos 4?

We know the following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, M, I, T, P, O, S.\n\nWe have to choose a word that fits: _ _ _ E R, and uses letters that are not in the excluded list.\n\nExcluded letters: C, A, N, M, I, T, P, O, S.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe also know that the word must be a valid English word.\n\nWe have to make a guess that uses only available letters and fits the pattern.\n\nLet\'s think of words ending with ""ER"". Common words: \n- like ""TIGER"" but T is excluded? T is absent, so no.\n- ""WATER"" but W is available? But A is excluded? A is absent, so no.\n- ""PAPER"" but P and A are excluded? No.\n- ""LOWER"" but O is excluded? O is absent, so no.\n\nWe need to avoid the excluded letters.\n\nPossible words: \n- ""LUGER"": L, U, G, E, R -> but we have E and R fixed? So the word would be ? ? ? E R, so the first three letters are L, U, G? But ""LUGER"" is a word? Yes, meaning a type of pistol or a sled.\n\nCheck letters: L, U, G are all in the available set? Yes.\n\nBut we have to consider: we don\'t know if L, U, G are in the word? We are testing them.\n\nAnother word: ""JEWEL""? But that ends with L? Not ""ER"". We need ""ER"" at the end.\n\nAnother: ""BOXER"" -> B, O, X, E, R -> but O is excluded? O is absent, so no.\n\nAnother: ""FEWER"" -> F, E, W, E, R -> but we have two E\'s? The pattern is _ _ _ E R, so the third letter must be a letter? And we have E at position 4? But ""FEWER"" has E at position 2 and 4? But we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s? It might? But in our pattern, we only have one E at position 4? So if we guess ""FEWER"", it would be F at 1, E at 2, W at 3, E at 4, R at 5? But we know E is at position 4? So the E at position 2 would be a new E? But we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s? It\'s possible? But we have to avoid using excluded letters? E is not excluded? But we know E is in the word? But we don\'t know if it appears twice? However, in the feedback so far, we only have one E? But that doesn\'t mean it can\'t be two? So we can try? But let\'s see: the pattern is fixed for positions 4 and 5: E and R? So the first three are unknown? But in ""FEWER"", the first three are F, E, W? Then E at 4? So the word would be F E W E R? But we are guessing the first three as F, E, W? And then E and R? But we are testing E at position 2? Which we know from guess2 that E is not at position 2? Because in ""merit"", E at position 2 got a \'-\', meaning E is in the word but not at position 2? So if we put E at position 2 again, it would be incorrect? And we would get a \'-\' again? But we already know that? So it\'s a waste? We should avoid putting E in a position we know it\'s not? So we should not put E at position 2? Similarly, we know E is not at position 5? But we are not putting it there? So for the first three positions, we should not put E? Because we know E is at position 4? And we don\'t have information about other E\'s? But we know E is not at position 2? And we haven\'t tried position 1 or 3? But we can try? However, we are trying to find the first three letters? And we know E is at position 4? So the first three positions are not E? Because if they were E, then we would have multiple E\'s? But we don\'t know? So to be safe, we should avoid putting E in the first three? Because we are not sure? But we can use E? But we know that position 2 is invalid for E? So we can put E at position 1 or 3? But if we put E at position 1, then we have E at 1 and E at 4? That\'s possible? But we don\'t know? \n\nBut let\'s reconsider: we have only one E confirmed? But the feedback doesn\'t tell us the count? So it could be multiple? But to maximize information, we should avoid using E again? Because we already know one E? And we know its position? So we can focus on finding the other letters? So it\'s better to use three new letters for the first three positions? Without E? Because if we use E, we might not get new information? For example, if we put E at position 1, and if it is present, we get a ✓? But we already know E is in the word? So it doesn\'t help? And if it\'s not, we get x? But we know E is in the word? So it must be present? So we would get a \'-\' if it\'s not at that position? Or if it is, we get ✓? But we are trying to find the first three? So it might be better to use non-E letters? \n\nTherefore, for the next guess, we should use three new letters from the available set for positions 1,2,3? And then E and R at 4 and 5? \n\nSo the word should be: [new1] [new2] [new3] E R\n\nAnd new1, new2, new3 are from B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? But excluding the ones we already know are absent? But we haven\'t tested any of these? So all are possible? \n\nWe need to choose a valid English word that fits this pattern? \n\nPossible words:\n- ""LUGER"" -> L U G E R -> valid? Yes? \n- ""FEWER"" -> but that has E at position 2? Which we want to avoid? Because we know E is not at position 2? So if we use ""FEWER"", we have E at position 2? Which we know is wrong? So we would get a \'-\' for E at position 2? And we already know that? So it doesn\'t give new information? And we are using one of the positions for E? Which we could have used for a new letter? So not efficient? \n\nSimilarly, ""JEWER""? Not a word? \n\n""BOXER"" has O? Excluded? \n\n""BAKER"" has A? Excluded? \n\n""MAKER"" has M and A? Excluded? \n\nSo let\'s list words ending with ""ER"" that have three letters from the available set? \n\nAvailable: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nWords:\n- ""LUGER"": L, U, G -> all available? \n- ""LIVER"": but I is excluded? I is absent? So no? \n- ""LOWER"": O is excluded? \n- ""DIVER"": I excluded? \n- ""RACER"": A and C excluded? \n- ""FLYER"": F, L, Y -> but Y is available? And ""FLYER"" is a word? But pattern: F L Y E R? So positions: 1:F, 2:L, 3:Y, 4:E, 5:R? \n  But we know E is at position 4? So that\'s fixed? And R at 5? So yes? \n  But we have to check if F, L, Y are allowed? They are not excluded? So yes? \n- ""FUZER""? Not a word? \n- ""JEWER""? Not a word? \n- ""HEWER"": H, E, W, E, R? But that would be H at 1, E at 2? But we know E is not at position 2? So if we use ""HEWER"", we have E at position 2? Which is invalid? So we get a \'-\' for E at 2? And we already know? So not good? \n- ""WAGER"": A excluded? \n- ""HOVER"": O excluded? \n- ""LIKER"": I and K? I excluded? \n- ""DOPER"": O excluded? \n- ""GAMER"": A excluded? \n- ""BUYER"": B, U, Y, E, R -> B, U, Y are available? And ""BUYER"" is a word? Pattern: B U Y E R? So positions: 1:B, 2:U, 3:Y, 4:E, 5:R? \n  This seems good? \n- ""LAYER"": A excluded? \n- ""POWER"": O excluded? \n- ""TOTER"": O and T excluded? \n- ""WISER"": I excluded? \n- ""USER"": U, S, E, R? But S is excluded? And also, it\'s 4 letters? We need 5? ""USER"" is 4? \n- ""USHER"": U, S, H, E, R -> but S excluded? \n- ""FIXER"": I excluded? \n- ""JOKER"": O excluded? \n- ""VOTER"": O and T excluded? \n- ""WAFER"": A excluded? \n- ""WIDER"": I excluded? \n- ""WISER"": I excluded? \n- ""WOMAN"": not ending with ER? \n\nSo possible words from above: \n- ""LUGER"" (L, U, G)\n- ""FLYER"" (F, L, Y)\n- ""BUYER"" (B, U, Y)\n\nAlso, ""JUDGER""? Too long? 6 letters? \n\n""QUEER"": Q, U, E, E, R -> but we have E at position 3 and 4? But we are putting E at position 3? And we know E is at position 4? So if we put E at position 3, we might get a ✓ or -? But we know E is at position 4? So if we put E at position 3, and if the word has only one E? Then we get a \'-\' for position 3? But if it has two E\'s? Then we might get a ✓? But we don\'t know? Also, ""QUEER"" has Q and U? But Q is available? \n\nBut let\'s see the pattern: Q U E E R? So positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:E, 4:E, 5:R? But we know position 4 is E? So that\'s fixed? But position 3 is E? So we are testing E at position 3? Which we haven\'t tried? But we know E is not at position 2 or 5? But position 3 is possible? \n\nHowever, we are using one of the first three positions for E? Instead of a new letter? So it might be less efficient? \n\nSimilarly, ""QUEER"" has two E\'s? But we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s? \n\nTo maximize information, it\'s better to use three new letters? So I think ""LUGER"", ""FLYER"", or ""BUYER"" are better? \n\nAmong these, which one to choose? \n\nWe can choose based on common letters? But in the available set, common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, L? Vowels: U? \n\n""LUGER"" has L, U, G? \n""FLYER"" has F, L, Y? \n""BUYER"" has B, U, Y? \n\n""FLYER"" has Y? Which can be a vowel? \n\nBut we don\'t know which are more common? \n\nSince we have limited guesses, we can pick one? \n\nAnother word: ""DUPER""? D, U, P, E, R? But P is excluded? P is absent? So no? \n\n""HYPER"": H, Y, P, E, R? P excluded? \n\n""LYCER""? Not a word? \n\n""JUKER""? Not a word? \n\nSo the three options: ""LUGER"", ""FLYER"", ""BUYER"". \n\nI think ""BUYER"" is a common word? But let\'s see: we can also consider ""JUDGE""? Not ending with ER? \n\nAnother: ""HOMER""? O excluded? \n\n""LUBER""? Not a word? \n\nSo I think we have to choose from the three. \n\nLet me pick ""FLYER"" because it tests F, L, Y? \n\nBut note: in ""FLYER"", the Y is at position 3? \n\nWe can also consider ""BLUER"": B, L, U, E, R -> but that has E at position 4? And R at 5? And B, L, U? All available? And ""BLUER"" is a word? \n\nYes, ""BLUER"" is a valid word? \n\nSo now we have:\n- ""LUGER"": L, U, G\n- ""FLYER"": F, L, Y\n- ""BUYER"": B, U, Y\n- ""BLUER"": B, L, U\n\n""BLUER"" uses B, L, U? \n\nWe can choose any? \n\nBut note: we have only 4 guesses left? We are on guess 4? \n\nWe can choose one that covers more common letters? \n\nCommon letters: L, U, B, F? \n\nI think ""BLUER"" is good? But it has U? \n\nAlternatively, ""FLYER"" has Y? Which is less common? \n\nBut let\'s pick ""BLUER"" because it uses B and L? \n\nBut we have to make a guess? \n\nAnother idea: we know the word ends with ""ER"", so we can try to think of common words? \n\nBut with the available letters? \n\n""EAGER""? A excluded? \n\n""ELDER""? E at position 1? But we don\'t know if E can be at position 1? We haven\'t tried? But we know E is at position 4? So if we put E at position 1, it might be a second E? Or not? \n\nBut in ""ELDER"", we have E at 1 and E at 4? But we are not sure? \n\nBut we are trying to avoid using E? \n\nSo back to the pattern: _ _ _ E R\n\nLet me choose ""BLUER"" as the next guess? \n\nSo guess: ""BLUER""\n\nBut ""BLUER"" is B L U E R? \n\nPositions: \n1: B\n2: L\n3: U\n4: E (which we know is correct? So we expect a ✓ for E? But we are guessing, so we will get feedback? \n5: R (correct? So ✓)\n\nBut we are testing B, L, U? \n\nIf the word is ""BLUER"", then we win? \n\nBut if not, we get feedback on B, L, U? \n\nSo it\'s a good guess? \n\nSimilarly, if we guess ""FLYER"", we test F, L, Y? \n\nI think ""BLUER"" is fine? \n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we have: we know E and R are fixed? So we are only guessing the first three? \n\nSo I\'ll go with ""BLUER"". \n\nBut note: ""BLUER"" has the same structure? \n\nSo <guess>bluer</guess> \n\nBut we must ensure it\'s a valid word? Yes? \n\nAlternatively, to cover more letters? But we have to choose one? \n\nI think it\'s okay? \n\nSo next guess: ""bluer""### Analysis of Previous Feedback\n\n- **Guess 1: ""crane""**  \n  - C, A, N: Absent (not in the word).  \n  - R: Present but wrong position (not position 2).  \n  - E: Present but wrong position (not position 5).  \n\n- **Guess 2: ""merit""**  \n  - M, I, T: Absent (not in the word).  \n  - E: Present but wrong position (not position 2).  \n  - R: Present but wrong position (not position 3).  \n\n- **Guess 3: ""poser""**  \n  - P, O, S: Absent (not in the word).  \n  - E: Correct position (position 4).  \n  - R: Correct position (position 5).  \n\n### Key Insights\n1. **Confirmed Letters & Positions**:  \n   - **E** is at **position 4**.  \n   - **R** is at **position 5**.  \n   The secret word pattern is: `_ _ _ E R`.  \n\n2. **Absent Letters**:  \n   C, A, N, M, I, T, P, O, S (cannot be in the word).  \n\n3. **Remaining Possible Letters**:  \n   B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  \n\n4. **Constraints for New Guess**:  \n   - Must be a 5-letter word ending in `ER`.  \n   - Positions 1–3 must use letters from the remaining pool (avoiding absent letters).  \n   - Maximize information by testing new common letters (e.g., B, L, U, F, Y).  \n\n### Strategy for Next Guess\n- **Goal**: Test high-frequency consonants (B, L, F) and vowels (U) in positions 1–3.  \n- **Ideal Word**: `B L U E R` (""bluer"") fits perfectly:  \n  - Tests B (position 1), L (position 2), U (position 3) — all untested letters.  \n  - Confirms E (position 4) and R (position 5) are fixed.  \n- **Why ""bluer""?**  \n  - Valid English word (adjective: more blue).  \n  - Covers three new letters efficiently.  \n  - If incorrect, feedback will reveal which of B/L/U are present/absent and their positions.\n\n<guess>bluer</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: merit -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(-) R(-) I(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: poser -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓) R(✓)\nGuess 4: bluer -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(✓) U(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from the fourth guess ""bluer"":
- B: absent (x)
- L: correct (✓) at position 2
- U: absent (x)
- E: correct (✓) at position 4 (as we already knew)
- R: correct (✓) at position 5 (as we already knew)

So now we know:
- The secret word has L at position 2.
- The secret word does not contain B or U.
- The pattern is: _ L _ E R

We also know the following letters are absent: C, A, N, M, I, T, P, O, S, B, U.

Available letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to fill the first and third positions.

The word is: [pos1] L [pos3] E R

We must choose a word that fits this pattern and uses only available letters.

We can list possible words:

- ""FLYER"": but F is available? But we have to check the pattern: F L Y E R -> so pos1: F, pos3: Y. But we have L at position 2? Yes. But we tried ""FLYER""? No, we haven't. But in the pattern, position 3 is Y? So the word would be F L Y E R? But we need to check if F and Y are allowed? They are in the available set? Yes.

But note: we have not tested F and Y? So they are possible? 

However, we have feedback that U is absent? But ""FLYER"" doesn't have U? So it's okay? 

But wait: in the available letters, we have F and Y? 

But let's see if there are other words? 

Another word: ""GLYER""? Not a word? 

""GLEEK""? Not ending with ER? 

""GLUER""? But U is absent? So no? 

""HELER""? H E L E R? But we have E at position 4? So if we put H at 1, E at 3? But we know E is at position 4? So if we put E at position 3, it might be a second E? But we don't know? 

But ""HELER"" is not a common word? 

""JEWEL""? Not ending with ER? 

""JOKER""? O excluded? 

""KNEEL""? K N E E L? But N is excluded? 

""QUEER"": Q U E E R? But U is excluded? 

""RULER"": R is at position 1? But we know R is at position 5? And we have L at position 2? But ""RULER"" has R at 1 and 5? And U at 2? But U is excluded? And also, we have L at position 2? But in ""RULER"", position 2 is U? Not L? So no? 

""SLYER"": S excluded? 

""WISER"": I and S excluded? 

""YELP""? Not ending with ER? 

""YELLER"": Y E L L E R? But that's 6 letters? 

""YELPER"": Y E L P E R? 6 letters? 

""FLYER"" seems a good candidate? 

But we have to check: in ""FLYER"", the letters are F, L, Y, E, R? 

Positions: 
1: F
2: L (which we know is correct? So we expect L to be at position 2? And we are putting it there? So it should be ✓)
3: Y
4: E (✓)
5: R (✓)

So we are testing F and Y? 

But is there a word like ""ALERT""? But A excluded? 

""ELECT""? Not ending with ER? 

So ""FLYER"" is a valid word? 

Another possibility: ""GLYPH""? Not ending with ER? 

""HYMEN""? Not ER? 

""HYPER"": H Y P E R? But P excluded? 

""JETES""? Not ER? 

""LEGER"": L E G E R? But we have L at position 2? So if we put L at position 1? But we know L is at position 2? So we cannot put L at position 1? Because we know L is at position 2? So the word must have L at position 2? 

In ""LEGER"", L is at position 1? So that would be incorrect? Because we know L is at position 2? So we must not put L at position 1? 

Similarly, we cannot put any other letter at position 2? Because L is fixed there? 

So the pattern is fixed: position 2 is L, position 4 is E, position 5 is R? 

So we only need to guess position 1 and position 3? 

So the word is: [letter1] L [letter3] E R

And letter1 and letter3 are from the available set? 

Now, ""FLYER"" has F at 1 and Y at 3? 

Another word: ""HOVER""? O excluded? 

""JIVER""? I excluded? 

""LIVED""? Not ER? 

""LOVER"": O excluded? 

""LUBRA""? Not ER? 

""LUCRE"": U and C excluded? 

""LUGER"": we considered earlier? But U is excluded? 

""LUMEN"": U and N excluded? 

""LYCRA"": C excluded? 

""LYTTA""? Not ER? 

""WHELP""? Not ER? 

""WIDER"": I excluded? 

""WISER"": I and S excluded? 

""YCLAD""? Not ER? 

So ""FLYER"" seems to be one of the few options? 

Another word: ""FLEER""? F L E E R? But that would be F at 1, L at 2, E at 3? But we know E is at position 4? So if we put E at position 3, it might be a second E? 

But ""FLEER"" is a word? Meaning to laugh mockingly? 

Pattern: F L E E R? So positions: 1:F, 2:L, 3:E, 4:E, 5:R? 

But we know position 4 is E? So that's fixed? But position 3 is E? So we are putting E at position 3? 

But we don't know if the word has two E's? It might? 

But in this case, we are testing E at position 3? 

But we already know E is at position 4? So if we put E at position 3, and if it is present, we get a ✓? But we already know E is in the word? So it doesn't give new information about presence? Only about position? 

But if the word has only one E? Then we would get a '-' for position 3? Or if it has two, we might get a ✓? 

But we are trying to find the word? 

However, we are using one of the positions for E? Instead of a new letter? So it might be less efficient? 

Therefore, ""FLYER"" is better because it tests two new letters: F and Y? 

Another word: ""GLEET""? Not ER? 

""GLUEY""? Not ER? 

So I think ""FLYER"" is a good choice? 

But let's see: we have not tested F and Y? And we are testing them in positions 1 and 3? 

So I'll go with ""FLYER"". 

But note: if the secret word is ""FLYER"", then we win? 

If not, we get feedback on F and Y? 

So <guess>flyer</guess> 

But wait, we have to make sure it's valid? Yes? 

Alternatively, is there a word like ""DEUCE""? Not ER? 

I think ""FLYER"" is fine? 

So next guess: ""flyer""

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane""
 Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)

 Interpretation:
 - C is not in the secret word (x)
 - R is in the secret word but not in the second position (-)
 - A is not in the secret word (x)
 - N is not in the secret word (x)
 - E is in the secret word but not in the fifth position (-)

 Therefore, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions we guessed (so R is not at position 2, E is not at position 5).
 - The secret word does not contain C, A, or N.

 Since R is in the word but not at position 2, and E is in the word but not at position 5, we need to form a new guess that includes R and E, and excludes C, A, N.

 We should also note that the secret word is 5 letters long.

 For our next guess, we want to try to place R and E in different positions and include other common letters that we haven't tested yet. We avoid using C, A, N.

 Let's think of common letters that can be used. We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We need to form a 5-letter word that has R and E, and avoids C, A, N.

 Also note that in the word ""crane"", the positions were:
 1: C (x)
 2: R (but R is in the word, just not here) -> so R must be in one of the positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? Actually, the feedback only says it's not at position 2. But note, we have a '-' for R at position 2 meaning it is elsewhere.

 Similarly, E is in the word but not at position 5, so E must be at one of the positions 1,2,3,4.

 However, we must also consider that we cannot put R and E in the same positions we already tried? Actually, we can put them in any position except the ones we know they are not. But note: we don't know where they are exactly.

 So, let's choose a word that has:
 - R in a position that is not 2, and E in a position that is not 5.

 Since we have two letters that are confirmed (R and E), we want to maximize information on the other letters.

 Possible words: We can consider words like ""TRIBE"", ""DRIVE"", ""STORE"", etc. But we have to avoid using C, A, N.

 Let me think of words that have R and E and no C, A, N.

 Another idea: We know R is in the word but not at position 2. We can try to put R in position 1? Then E in a different position? Also, we can test more vowels and common consonants.

 One good candidate is ""ROUTE"": 
   R in position 1 (which is a new position for R) 
   E in position 5? But wait, the feedback said E is not in position 5? Actually, we must avoid putting E at position 5 because we know it's not there.

 So let's put E in a position between 1 and 4.

 Alternatively, let me pick a word that places R and E in new positions and uses other common letters.

 Suggestion: ""STRETCH"" is 7 letters, too long. We need 5 letters.

 How about ""STORE"": 
   S, T, O, R, E.
   But note: in ""STORE"", R is in position 4 and E is in position 5. However, we are not allowed to put E at position 5? The feedback from ""crane"" said E is not at position 5? Actually, the feedback was for the fifth letter (E) of ""crane"" being not correct. But it does not mean that E cannot be at position 5? Wait, no: the feedback says the letter E is present in the word but not at that position. So if we put E at position 5 in ""STORE"", it might be that in the secret word E is at position 5? But wait, we know from the first guess that E is not at position 5? Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" says that E is in the word but not at position 5. Therefore, we know that E is in the secret word somewhere else, so if we put E at position 5 now, it must be incorrect? Actually, no: the feedback only told us that in the word ""crane"", the E at position 5 was not the right position. It doesn't forbid E from being at position 5? Well, if the secret word had E at position 5, then when we guessed ""crane"", which has E at position 5, we would have gotten a ✓ for E. But we got a '-' meaning it is present but not at that position. Therefore, we can deduce that E is definitely not at position 5? So we should avoid placing E at position 5 in our new guess? Actually, we can try to put E in a different position to get more information.

 So for ""STORE"":
   Positions: 
      1: S
      2: T
      3: O
      4: R
      5: E   -> but we know E is not at position 5? So this would be incorrect? Actually, we can avoid position 5 for E.

 So let me choose a word with E at positions 1-4.

 Another word: ""TRIED"" -> has E in position 5? No: T, R, I, E, D -> E is at position 4? Actually, ""TRIED"" is T-R-I-E-D: position 1: T, 2: R, 3: I, 4: E, 5: D. 
   But we have R at position 2? And in the first guess we had R at position 2 and it was present but in the wrong position? So wait: the secret word has R but not at position 2. Does that mean R must be in one of the other positions? But when we put R at position 2 again, we would expect a '-' again? Maybe we can use that to see if R is at position 2? But no: we know it's not at position 2? Actually, the feedback told us that R is not at position 2. So if we put R at position 2 again, we would get a '-' again? But we don't learn anything new by putting R in the same wrong position? Moreover, we already know R is in the word, so putting it at position 2 again would only confirm it's still not placed correctly? But we want to try to put R in a different position to hit the correct one.

 So ideally, let's place R in a position that we haven't tried. We have only tried position 2 for R. So we can try R at positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Similarly, we have only tried E at position 5? So we can try E at positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 Therefore, let's choose a word that has R at a position other than 2, and E at a position other than 5.

 Example: ""DRIVE"": 
   D, R, I, V, E
   R is at position 2? Then we would get a '-' for R again? But we want to try a different position for R? So avoid position 2.

 How about ""RODEO""? No, it has E? Actually, no: R, O, D, E, O -> yes, E at position 4.

 But ""RODEO"": 
   R at position 1 -> new position for R? 
   O? 
   D? 
   E at position 4? 
   O? 

 But ""RODEO"" has two O's? And we don't know if the secret word has O? But we can test O and D.

 However, let me think: we haven't been given any information about O and D so they are allowed? And we know we must use R and E and avoid C, A, N.

 So ""RODEO"" is a valid word? But note: the secret word might contain duplicate letters? But in this case, we don't know.

 Alternatively, let's choose a word without duplicate letters? We can get more information.

 Also, let me consider that we have two letters to include: R and E. We need three more.

 Let me try ""RESTY"": 
   R at position 1 (new position), E at position 2 (which hasn't been tried for E because we've only tried E at position 5). 
   S, T, Y? 

 But note: E is at position 2? And we don't know if E can be there? 

 Steps:

 We want to plan:
   Position for R: avoid 2 -> try 1, 3, 4, 5.
   Position for E: avoid 5 -> try 1, 2, 3, 4.

 Also, we want to test as many new letters as possible? Because we have only ruled out C, A, N.

 Let me choose a word that includes common letters: S, T, etc.

 Another candidate: ""RIPES"": 
   R at 1, I, P, E, S? Then E at position 4? S at 5? 

 But ""RIPES"" is a word? Yes.

 However, note that we have two known letters: we are including R and E, and the rest are new (I, P, S).

 How about ""STERN"": 
   S, T, E, R, N? But N is disallowed? We know N is not in the word? We cannot use N.

 So let's avoid forbidden letters: C, A, N? Forbidden letters: C, A, N.

 Therefore, any word that includes C, A, or N is invalid? We should not guess a word with these letters because we know they are not in the secret word.

 So ""STERN"" has N -> invalid.

 Words without C, A, N and that have R and E? And don't put R at position 2? And don't put E at position 5?

 Let me think of common words: 
   ""SERIF"": 
      S, E, R, I, F -> 
        E at position 2? 
        R at position 3? 
        This avoids putting R at position 2 and E at position 5? 
        Positions: 
          1: S
          2: E -> we haven't tried E at position 2? 
          3: R -> we haven't tried R at position 3? 
          4: I
          5: F

   This seems good? 

 Another: ""RESIN"": cannot because it has N? Disallowed.

 Another: ""MERIT"": M, E, R, I, T -> E at 2? R at 3? 

 But we also haven't tested M, I, T? So yes.

 However, note: in ""MERIT"", E is at position 2 and R at position 3? 

 Alternatively, what about ""BEARD"": B, E, A, R, D? But A is disallowed? Cannot use A.

 So let me check: ""TERSE"" -> 
   T, E, R, S, E -> duplicates? 
   But it has E at position 2 and 5? And we know E is not at position 5? So we avoid putting E at 5? 
   But here at position 5: E? So we shouldn't? Actually, we must avoid position 5 for E? But we can test? However, it would likely be inefficient.

 So I prefer ""MERIT"". 

 Steps:
   We'll guess ""MERIT"": 
        M at position 1 (new letter)
        E at position 2 (new position for E? Not position 5)
        R at position 3 (new position for R? Not position 2)
        I at position 4 (new letter)
        T at position 5 (new letter)

 Then we can get feedback on M, E, R, I, T.

 Also, note: if the secret word has E at position 2? Then we'd get a ✓? And similarly for R.

 So let me go with ""MERIT"".

 However, note: the first guess had R at position 2 and we got a '-', meaning R is in the secret word but not at position 2. Now we are putting R at position 3? Similarly, we are putting E at position 2? We don't know if E can be at position 2? It's possible? Because we only know E is not at position 5? 

 Therefore, let's proceed with ""MERIT"".

 Another candidate: ""RULES"": 
   R at position 1, U, L, E, S -> E at position 4? 
   And we avoid forbidden letters. 

 Both ""MERIT"" and ""RULES"" are good? But ""RULES"" uses U and L? Which are less common? Maybe? 

 But ""RULES"" also tests U and L? We don't know? So both are valid.

 However, let me choose ""MERIT"" because it includes T, which is a very common letter? And M, I? 

 So guess ""MERIT"".

 Therefore, my next guess is ""merit"".

<guess>merit</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- C, A, N are **not** in the secret word (all marked ""x"").  
- R is in the word but **not in position 2** (marked ""-"").  
- E is in the word but **not in position 5** (marked ""-"").  

Since R and E are confirmed present, the next guess must:  
1. Include R and E.  
2. Avoid C, A, N.  
3. Place R in a new position (not 2).  
4. Place E in a new position (not 5).  

The word ""merit"" meets these criteria:  
- Positions R (3rd) and E (2nd) differ from the first guess.  
- Tests new common letters (M, I, T) while excluding C, A, N.  

This maximizes information gain about letter placements and additional letters.

<guess>merit</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: merit -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(-) R(-) I(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>Okay, let me analyze the feedback we've received so far to make the next guess. 

First, the information from both guesses:

From Guess 1 (""crane""):
- C, A, N not in word
- R present but not position 2
- E present but not position 5

From Guess 2 (""merit""):
- M not in word (x)
- E present but not position 2 (-) → confirms E not position 5 or 2
- R present but not position 3 (-) → confirms R not position 2 or 3
- I not in word (x)
- T not in word (x)

Now we know:
✅ Present letters: R, E
⛔ Absent letters: C, A, N, M, I, T

Position constraints:
- R cannot be position 2 or 3
- E cannot be position 2 or 5

Available letters: Must include R and E, avoid C/A/N/M/I/T. That leaves lots of options: B,D,F,G,H,K,O,P,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z,and maybe others.

Given R must be in positions 1,4 or 5 (since 2/3 excluded), and E must be in positions 1,3 or 4 (since 2/5 excluded).

Possible word pattern: 5 letters including R and E, using only unused consonants/vowels.

Need to maximize information: Should test new common letters like S,D,O,L etc.

Considering words:
- ""RODEO"" → contains O/D/E/R? But O repeated and we don't know if duplicates allowed. Also E position? Wait: R-O-D-E-O → positions: R(1), O(2), D(3), E(4), O(5). E position 4 → allowed. But ""O"" appears twice - if secret word has only one O, we might get false feedback? Avoid for now? But it's possible.

Better options? Trying:
- ""POSER"": P-O-S-E-R → has S,P,O,R,E. Positions: E at 4? R at 5? Both new positions. Tests P,O,S.
- Checks: R at position 5 (new), E at 4 (new). No conflicting letters. That could be good.

Another option: ""LOSER"". But L not tested? We get ""L"" info? Actually same structure: L-O-S-E-R → E at 4, R at 5.

But note: We only have 6 total guesses. We used 2, have 4 left? Since we're on guess 3.

But wait: feedback for ""merit"" showed E(-) at position 2 - that means E exists elsewhere? So yes, E is in word but not at position 2. Similarly R not at position 2 or 3? So we are narrowing down? We know R must be at pos 1,4,5 and E at pos 1,3,4? Since E cannot be at position 2 or 5? And R cannot be at 2 or 3?

Also, secret word has these two letters still? We haven't placed them? So we need to focus on placing R and E? Also, the word has 5 letters? We know two letters? The other three letters are unknown? And not among the excluded letters? So a lot possible? Better to choose a word with more new letters? So ""POSER"" tests P O S? But note, we haven't tested these? So they could be in or out? Good to test.

But also possible: ""FORES"". F-O-R-E-S → R at position 3 → which was excluded? Because from ""merit"", R cannot be at position 3? So we must not put R at position 3? ""FORES"" has R at position 3 → invalid? Because we know R not at position 3? So cannot test words putting R in known wrong positions? So ""FORES"" invalid? Similarly, we cannot put E in position 2 or 5? Or R in 2 or 3? So ""POSER"": R at position 5? Which is new? And E at position 4? Also new? So that works.

Another possibility: ""ROUGH"". But no E? Must include E? So invalid.

Alternative word: ""OILER"" → but I not in word? And we have I excluded? So invalid? Because I is absent? Cannot use I? So discard.

Any better? ""POWER"" → no E? Wait, has E? P-O-W-E-R? E at 4? R at 5? And includes W? But ""POWER"" is five letters? Positions: P(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), R(5)? That seems good? But does it have any known absent letters? C,A,N,M,I,T - none used? So valid? Plus tests P,O,W? 

But compare to ""POSER"": also tests P,O,S? S is more common? Maybe better? Alternatively, ""POSER"" also has S? Which is common? Maybe ""POSER"" better? But ""POWER"" includes W? Which is less common? So perhaps ""POSER"" better?

But note: ""POSER"" has S? Could test S? While ""POWER"" tests W? I think S is more frequent? So prefer ""POSER""? Or ""ROUSE"" → R-O-U-S-E → R at pos1? O at2? U at3? S at4? E at5 → but E at5 not allowed? Because we know E not at position 5? So cannot use position 5 for E? So discard.

Thus ""POSER"": E at position 4? Which is new? R at position 5? New? So positions: 
- Position 1: P? New? 
- Position 2: O? New? 
- Position 3: S? New? 
- Position 4: E → attempting E at position 4? Which is an allowed position? 
- Position 5: R → attempting R at position 5? Which is allowed? 

Plus tests new letters P,O,S? Which are common? 

So let's go with ""POSER"".

In summary: 
- Previous constraints handled? 
- Includes R and E? In new positions? 
- Uses all new letters? 
- Avoids forbidden letters? Yes?Based on the feedback:

**Feedback Analysis**
1. **New Absent Letters**: M, I, T (so far: C, A, N, M, I, T excluded)
2. **Confirmed Presence**: 
   - R is in the secret word but now confirmed *not at positions 2 or 3* (received ""-"" in both guesses). 
   - E is in the secret word but confirmed *not at positions 2 or 5* (received ""-"" in both guesses).
3. **Position Constraints**:
   - R can only be at positions 1, 4, or 5.
   - E can only be at positions 1, 3, or 4.

**Next Guess Strategy**
- Must include **R and E**, exclude C/A/N/M/I/T.
- Prioritize **new common consonants/vowels**: S, O, D, L, P (untested).
- Place R/E in **new valid positions**: E at 3/4? R at 1/4/5?
- Ideal word structure: Tests 3 new letters + R/E?  
- Top candidate: **""POSER""**  
  - P (new), O (new), S (new), E (position 4? new slot), R (position 5? new slot)  
  - Tests E at pos 4? R at pos 5? Maximizes coverage of S/O/P?

<guess>poser</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: merit -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(-) R(-) I(x) T(x)
Guess 3: poser -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: absent (x)
- R: present but wrong position (-) -> so R is in the word, not at position 2
- A: absent (x)
- N: absent (x)
- E: present but wrong position (-) -> so E is in the word, not at position 5

Guess 2: ""merit""
- M: absent (x)
- E: present but wrong position (-) -> E is not at position 2 (since we tried it at position 2 and got -)
- R: present but wrong position (-) -> R is not at position 3 (since we tried it at position 3 and got -)
- I: absent (x)
- T: absent (x)

Guess 3: ""poser""
- P: absent (x)
- O: absent (x)
- S: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓) -> so E is at position 4
- R: correct position (✓) -> so R is at position 5

So now we know:
- The secret word has E at position 4 and R at position 5.
- The letters that are absent: C, A, N, M, I, T, P, O, S (from the x's in all guesses)
- We also know that R and E are in the word, and we now know their positions: E at 4, R at 5.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: _ _ _ E R

We need to find the first three letters. We know the following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, M, I, T, P, O, S.

We have to choose a word that fits: _ _ _ E R, and uses letters that are not in the excluded list.

Excluded letters: C, A, N, M, I, T, P, O, S.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

We have to make a guess that uses only available letters and fits the pattern.

Let's think of words ending with ""ER"". Common words: 
- like ""TIGER"" but T is excluded? T is absent, so no.
- ""WATER"" but W is available? But A is excluded? A is absent, so no.
- ""PAPER"" but P and A are excluded? No.
- ""LOWER"" but O is excluded? O is absent, so no.

We need to avoid the excluded letters.

Possible words: 
- ""LUGER"": L, U, G, E, R -> but we have E and R fixed? So the word would be ? ? ? E R, so the first three letters are L, U, G? But ""LUGER"" is a word? Yes, meaning a type of pistol or a sled.

Check letters: L, U, G are all in the available set? Yes.

But we have to consider: we don't know if L, U, G are in the word? We are testing them.

Another word: ""JEWEL""? But that ends with L? Not ""ER"". We need ""ER"" at the end.

Another: ""BOXER"" -> B, O, X, E, R -> but O is excluded? O is absent, so no.

Another: ""FEWER"" -> F, E, W, E, R -> but we have two E's? The pattern is _ _ _ E R, so the third letter must be a letter? And we have E at position 4? But ""FEWER"" has E at position 2 and 4? But we don't know if the word has two E's? It might? But in our pattern, we only have one E at position 4? So if we guess ""FEWER"", it would be F at 1, E at 2, W at 3, E at 4, R at 5? But we know E is at position 4? So the E at position 2 would be a new E? But we don't know if the word has two E's? It's possible? But we have to avoid using excluded letters? E is not excluded? But we know E is in the word? But we don't know if it appears twice? However, in the feedback so far, we only have one E? But that doesn't mean it can't be two? So we can try? But let's see: the pattern is fixed for positions 4 and 5: E and R? So the first three are unknown? But in ""FEWER"", the first three are F, E, W? Then E at 4? So the word would be F E W E R? But we are guessing the first three as F, E, W? And then E and R? But we are testing E at position 2? Which we know from guess2 that E is not at position 2? Because in ""merit"", E at position 2 got a '-', meaning E is in the word but not at position 2? So if we put E at position 2 again, it would be incorrect? And we would get a '-' again? But we already know that? So it's a waste? We should avoid putting E in a position we know it's not? So we should not put E at position 2? Similarly, we know E is not at position 5? But we are not putting it there? So for the first three positions, we should not put E? Because we know E is at position 4? And we don't have information about other E's? But we know E is not at position 2? And we haven't tried position 1 or 3? But we can try? However, we are trying to find the first three letters? And we know E is at position 4? So the first three positions are not E? Because if they were E, then we would have multiple E's? But we don't know? So to be safe, we should avoid putting E in the first three? Because we are not sure? But we can use E? But we know that position 2 is invalid for E? So we can put E at position 1 or 3? But if we put E at position 1, then we have E at 1 and E at 4? That's possible? But we don't know? 

But let's reconsider: we have only one E confirmed? But the feedback doesn't tell us the count? So it could be multiple? But to maximize information, we should avoid using E again? Because we already know one E? And we know its position? So we can focus on finding the other letters? So it's better to use three new letters for the first three positions? Without E? Because if we use E, we might not get new information? For example, if we put E at position 1, and if it is present, we get a ✓? But we already know E is in the word? So it doesn't help? And if it's not, we get x? But we know E is in the word? So it must be present? So we would get a '-' if it's not at that position? Or if it is, we get ✓? But we are trying to find the first three? So it might be better to use non-E letters? 

Therefore, for the next guess, we should use three new letters from the available set for positions 1,2,3? And then E and R at 4 and 5? 

So the word should be: [new1] [new2] [new3] E R

And new1, new2, new3 are from B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? But excluding the ones we already know are absent? But we haven't tested any of these? So all are possible? 

We need to choose a valid English word that fits this pattern? 

Possible words:
- ""LUGER"" -> L U G E R -> valid? Yes? 
- ""FEWER"" -> but that has E at position 2? Which we want to avoid? Because we know E is not at position 2? So if we use ""FEWER"", we have E at position 2? Which we know is wrong? So we would get a '-' for E at position 2? And we already know that? So it doesn't give new information? And we are using one of the positions for E? Which we could have used for a new letter? So not efficient? 

Similarly, ""JEWER""? Not a word? 

""BOXER"" has O? Excluded? 

""BAKER"" has A? Excluded? 

""MAKER"" has M and A? Excluded? 

So let's list words ending with ""ER"" that have three letters from the available set? 

Available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Words:
- ""LUGER"": L, U, G -> all available? 
- ""LIVER"": but I is excluded? I is absent? So no? 
- ""LOWER"": O is excluded? 
- ""DIVER"": I excluded? 
- ""RACER"": A and C excluded? 
- ""FLYER"": F, L, Y -> but Y is available? And ""FLYER"" is a word? But pattern: F L Y E R? So positions: 1:F, 2:L, 3:Y, 4:E, 5:R? 
  But we know E is at position 4? So that's fixed? And R at 5? So yes? 
  But we have to check if F, L, Y are allowed? They are not excluded? So yes? 
- ""FUZER""? Not a word? 
- ""JEWER""? Not a word? 
- ""HEWER"": H, E, W, E, R? But that would be H at 1, E at 2? But we know E is not at position 2? So if we use ""HEWER"", we have E at position 2? Which is invalid? So we get a '-' for E at 2? And we already know? So not good? 
- ""WAGER"": A excluded? 
- ""HOVER"": O excluded? 
- ""LIKER"": I and K? I excluded? 
- ""DOPER"": O excluded? 
- ""GAMER"": A excluded? 
- ""BUYER"": B, U, Y, E, R -> B, U, Y are available? And ""BUYER"" is a word? Pattern: B U Y E R? So positions: 1:B, 2:U, 3:Y, 4:E, 5:R? 
  This seems good? 
- ""LAYER"": A excluded? 
- ""POWER"": O excluded? 
- ""TOTER"": O and T excluded? 
- ""WISER"": I excluded? 
- ""USER"": U, S, E, R? But S is excluded? And also, it's 4 letters? We need 5? ""USER"" is 4? 
- ""USHER"": U, S, H, E, R -> but S excluded? 
- ""FIXER"": I excluded? 
- ""JOKER"": O excluded? 
- ""VOTER"": O and T excluded? 
- ""WAFER"": A excluded? 
- ""WIDER"": I excluded? 
- ""WISER"": I excluded? 
- ""WOMAN"": not ending with ER? 

So possible words from above: 
- ""LUGER"" (L, U, G)
- ""FLYER"" (F, L, Y)
- ""BUYER"" (B, U, Y)

Also, ""JUDGER""? Too long? 6 letters? 

""QUEER"": Q, U, E, E, R -> but we have E at position 3 and 4? But we are putting E at position 3? And we know E is at position 4? So if we put E at position 3, we might get a ✓ or -? But we know E is at position 4? So if we put E at position 3, and if the word has only one E? Then we get a '-' for position 3? But if it has two E's? Then we might get a ✓? But we don't know? Also, ""QUEER"" has Q and U? But Q is available? 

But let's see the pattern: Q U E E R? So positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:E, 4:E, 5:R? But we know position 4 is E? So that's fixed? But position 3 is E? So we are testing E at position 3? Which we haven't tried? But we know E is not at position 2 or 5? But position 3 is possible? 

However, we are using one of the first three positions for E? Instead of a new letter? So it might be less efficient? 

Similarly, ""QUEER"" has two E's? But we don't know if the word has two E's? 

To maximize information, it's better to use three new letters? So I think ""LUGER"", ""FLYER"", or ""BUYER"" are better? 

Among these, which one to choose? 

We can choose based on common letters? But in the available set, common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, L? Vowels: U? 

""LUGER"" has L, U, G? 
""FLYER"" has F, L, Y? 
""BUYER"" has B, U, Y? 

""FLYER"" has Y? Which can be a vowel? 

But we don't know which are more common? 

Since we have limited guesses, we can pick one? 

Another word: ""DUPER""? D, U, P, E, R? But P is excluded? P is absent? So no? 

""HYPER"": H, Y, P, E, R? P excluded? 

""LYCER""? Not a word? 

""JUKER""? Not a word? 

So the three options: ""LUGER"", ""FLYER"", ""BUYER"". 

I think ""BUYER"" is a common word? But let's see: we can also consider ""JUDGE""? Not ending with ER? 

Another: ""HOMER""? O excluded? 

""LUBER""? Not a word? 

So I think we have to choose from the three. 

Let me pick ""FLYER"" because it tests F, L, Y? 

But note: in ""FLYER"", the Y is at position 3? 

We can also consider ""BLUER"": B, L, U, E, R -> but that has E at position 4? And R at 5? And B, L, U? All available? And ""BLUER"" is a word? 

Yes, ""BLUER"" is a valid word? 

So now we have:
- ""LUGER"": L, U, G
- ""FLYER"": F, L, Y
- ""BUYER"": B, U, Y
- ""BLUER"": B, L, U

""BLUER"" uses B, L, U? 

We can choose any? 

But note: we have only 4 guesses left? We are on guess 4? 

We can choose one that covers more common letters? 

Common letters: L, U, B, F? 

I think ""BLUER"" is good? But it has U? 

Alternatively, ""FLYER"" has Y? Which is less common? 

But let's pick ""BLUER"" because it uses B and L? 

But we have to make a guess? 

Another idea: we know the word ends with ""ER"", so we can try to think of common words? 

But with the available letters? 

""EAGER""? A excluded? 

""ELDER""? E at position 1? But we don't know if E can be at position 1? We haven't tried? But we know E is at position 4? So if we put E at position 1, it might be a second E? Or not? 

But in ""ELDER"", we have E at 1 and E at 4? But we are not sure? 

But we are trying to avoid using E? 

So back to the pattern: _ _ _ E R

Let me choose ""BLUER"" as the next guess? 

So guess: ""BLUER""

But ""BLUER"" is B L U E R? 

Positions: 
1: B
2: L
3: U
4: E (which we know is correct? So we expect a ✓ for E? But we are guessing, so we will get feedback? 
5: R (correct? So ✓)

But we are testing B, L, U? 

If the word is ""BLUER"", then we win? 

But if not, we get feedback on B, L, U? 

So it's a good guess? 

Similarly, if we guess ""FLYER"", we test F, L, Y? 

I think ""BLUER"" is fine? 

But let's see the feedback we have: we know E and R are fixed? So we are only guessing the first three? 

So I'll go with ""BLUER"". 

But note: ""BLUER"" has the same structure? 

So <guess>bluer</guess> 

But we must ensure it's a valid word? Yes? 

Alternatively, to cover more letters? But we have to choose one? 

I think it's okay? 

So next guess: ""bluer""### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
  - C, A, N: Absent (not in the word).  
  - R: Present but wrong position (not position 2).  
  - E: Present but wrong position (not position 5).  

- **Guess 2: ""merit""**  
  - M, I, T: Absent (not in the word).  
  - E: Present but wrong position (not position 2).  
  - R: Present but wrong position (not position 3).  

- **Guess 3: ""poser""**  
  - P, O, S: Absent (not in the word).  
  - E: Correct position (position 4).  
  - R: Correct position (position 5).  

### Key Insights
1. **Confirmed Letters & Positions**:  
   - **E** is at **position 4**.  
   - **R** is at **position 5**.  
   The secret word pattern is: `_ _ _ E R`.  

2. **Absent Letters**:  
   C, A, N, M, I, T, P, O, S (cannot be in the word).  

3. **Remaining Possible Letters**:  
   B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

4. **Constraints for New Guess**:  
   - Must be a 5-letter word ending in `ER`.  
   - Positions 1–3 must use letters from the remaining pool (avoiding absent letters).  
   - Maximize information by testing new common letters (e.g., B, L, U, F, Y).  

### Strategy for Next Guess
- **Goal**: Test high-frequency consonants (B, L, F) and vowels (U) in positions 1–3.  
- **Ideal Word**: `B L U E R` (""bluer"") fits perfectly:  
  - Tests B (position 1), L (position 2), U (position 3) — all untested letters.  
  - Confirms E (position 4) and R (position 5) are fixed.  
- **Why ""bluer""?**  
  - Valid English word (adjective: more blue).  
  - Covers three new letters efficiently.  
  - If incorrect, feedback will reveal which of B/L/U are present/absent and their positions.

<guess>bluer</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: merit -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(-) R(-) I(x) T(x)
Guess 3: poser -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓) R(✓)
Guess 4: bluer -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(✓) U(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the feedback from the fourth guess ""bluer"":
- B: absent (x)
- L: correct (✓) at position 2
- U: absent (x)
- E: correct (✓) at position 4 (as we already knew)
- R: correct (✓) at position 5 (as we already knew)

So now we know:
- The secret word has L at position 2.
- The secret word does not contain B or U.
- The pattern is: _ L _ E R

We also know the following letters are absent: C, A, N, M, I, T, P, O, S, B, U.

Available letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to fill the first and third positions.

The word is: [pos1] L [pos3] E R

We must choose a word that fits this pattern and uses only available letters.

We can list possible words:

- ""FLYER"": but F is available? But we have to check the pattern: F L Y E R -> so pos1: F, pos3: Y. But we have L at position 2? Yes. But we tried ""FLYER""? No, we haven't. But in the pattern, position 3 is Y? So the word would be F L Y E R? But we need to check if F and Y are allowed? They are in the available set? Yes.

But note: we have not tested F and Y? So they are possible? 

However, we have feedback that U is absent? But ""FLYER"" doesn't have U? So it's okay? 

But wait: in the available letters, we have F and Y? 

But let's see if there are other words? 

Another word: ""GLYER""? Not a word? 

""GLEEK""? Not ending with ER? 

""GLUER""? But U is absent? So no? 

""HELER""? H E L E R? But we have E at position 4? So if we put H at 1, E at 3? But we know E is at position 4? So if we put E at position 3, it might be a second E? But we don't know? 

But ""HELER"" is not a common word? 

""JEWEL""? Not ending with ER? 

""JOKER""? O excluded? 

""KNEEL""? K N E E L? But N is excluded? 

""QUEER"": Q U E E R? But U is excluded? 

""RULER"": R is at position 1? But we know R is at position 5? And we have L at position 2? But ""RULER"" has R at 1 and 5? And U at 2? But U is excluded? And also, we have L at position 2? But in ""RULER"", position 2 is U? Not L? So no? 

""SLYER"": S excluded? 

""WISER"": I and S excluded? 

""YELP""? Not ending with ER? 

""YELLER"": Y E L L E R? But that's 6 letters? 

""YELPER"": Y E L P E R? 6 letters? 

""FLYER"" seems a good candidate? 

But we have to check: in ""FLYER"", the letters are F, L, Y, E, R? 

Positions: 
1: F
2: L (which we know is correct? So we expect L to be at position 2? And we are putting it there? So it should be ✓)
3: Y
4: E (✓)
5: R (✓)

So we are testing F and Y? 

But is there a word like ""ALERT""? But A excluded? 

""ELECT""? Not ending with ER? 

So ""FLYER"" is a valid word? 

Another possibility: ""GLYPH""? Not ending with ER? 

""HYMEN""? Not ER? 

""HYPER"": H Y P E R? But P excluded? 

""JETES""? Not ER? 

""LEGER"": L E G E R? But we have L at position 2? So if we put L at position 1? But we know L is at position 2? So we cannot put L at position 1? Because we know L is at position 2? So the word must have L at position 2? 

In ""LEGER"", L is at position 1? So that would be incorrect? Because we know L is at position 2? So we must not put L at position 1? 

Similarly, we cannot put any other letter at position 2? Because L is fixed there? 

So the pattern is fixed: position 2 is L, position 4 is E, position 5 is R? 

So we only need to guess position 1 and position 3? 

So the word is: [letter1] L [letter3] E R

And letter1 and letter3 are from the available set? 

Now, ""FLYER"" has F at 1 and Y at 3? 

Another word: ""HOVER""? O excluded? 

""JIVER""? I excluded? 

""LIVED""? Not ER? 

""LOVER"": O excluded? 

""LUBRA""? Not ER? 

""LUCRE"": U and C excluded? 

""LUGER"": we considered earlier? But U is excluded? 

""LUMEN"": U and N excluded? 

""LYCRA"": C excluded? 

""LYTTA""? Not ER? 

""WHELP""? Not ER? 

""WIDER"": I excluded? 

""WISER"": I and S excluded? 

""YCLAD""? Not ER? 

So ""FLYER"" seems to be one of the few options? 

Another word: ""FLEER""? F L E E R? But that would be F at 1, L at 2, E at 3? But we know E is at position 4? So if we put E at position 3, it might be a second E? 

But ""FLEER"" is a word? Meaning to laugh mockingly? 

Pattern: F L E E R? So positions: 1:F, 2:L, 3:E, 4:E, 5:R? 

But we know position 4 is E? So that's fixed? But position 3 is E? So we are putting E at position 3? 

But we don't know if the word has two E's? It might? 

But in this case, we are testing E at position 3? 

But we already know E is at position 4? So if we put E at position 3, and if it is present, we get a ✓? But we already know E is in the word? So it doesn't give new information about presence? Only about position? 

But if the word has only one E? Then we would get a '-' for position 3? Or if it has two, we might get a ✓? 

But we are trying to find the word? 

However, we are using one of the positions for E? Instead of a new letter? So it might be less efficient? 

Therefore, ""FLYER"" is better because it tests two new letters: F and Y? 

Another word: ""GLEET""? Not ER? 

""GLUEY""? Not ER? 

So I think ""FLYER"" is a good choice? 

But let's see: we have not tested F and Y? And we are testing them in positions 1 and 3? 

So I'll go with ""FLYER"". 

But note: if the secret word is ""FLYER"", then we win? 

If not, we get feedback on F and Y? 

So <guess>flyer</guess> 

But wait, we have to make sure it's valid? Yes? 

Alternatively, is there a word like ""DEUCE""? Not ER? 

I think ""FLYER"" is fine? 

So next guess: ""flyer""### Analysis of Previous Feedback
- **Guess 4: ""bluer""**  
  - B: Absent (x) → Not in the word.  
  - L: Correct (✓) at position 2 → **L is fixed at position 2**.  
  - U: Absent (x) → Not in the word.  
  - E: Correct (✓) at position 4 (already known).  
  - R: Correct (✓) at position 5 (already known).  

### Key Insights
1. **Secret Word Pattern**: `_ L _ E R`  
   - Position 2: **L** (confirmed).  
   - Position 4: **E** (confirmed).  
   - Position 5: **R** (confirmed).  
   - Positions 1 and 3: Unknown letters.  

2. **Absent Letters**:  
   C, A, N, M, I, T, P, O, S, B, U (all excluded).  

3. **Remaining Possible Letters**:  
   D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

4. **Strategy for Next Guess**:  
   - Test high-frequency consonants (e.g., F, Y) in positions 1 and 3.  
   - Prioritize words that fit the pattern `_ L _ E R` and use untested letters.  
   - **Optimal Word**: ""FLYER"" (F L Y E R):  
     - Tests **F** (position 1) and **Y** (position 3) — both new letters.  
     - Maintains fixed L (position 2), E (position 4), R (position 5).  
     - If incorrect, feedback will confirm if F/Y are present and their positions.

We avoid using C, A, N.\n\n Let\'s think of common letters that can be used. We haven\'t tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n We need to form a 5-letter word that has R and E, and avoids C, A, N.\n\n Also note that in the word ""crane"", the positions were:\n 1: C (x)\n 2: R (but R is in the word, just not here) -> so R must be in one of the positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? Actually, the feedback only says it\'s not at position 2. But note, we have a \'-\' for R at position 2 meaning it is elsewhere.\n\n Similarly, E is in the word but not at position 5, so E must be at one of the positions 1,2,3,4.\n\n However, we must also consider that we cannot put R and E in the same positions we already tried? Actually, we can put them in any position except the ones we know they are not. But note: we don\'t know where they are exactly.\n\n So, let\'s choose a word that has:\n - R in a position that is not 2, and E in a position that is not 5.\n\n Since we have two letters that are confirmed (R and E), we want to maximize information on the other letters.\n\n Possible words: We can consider words like ""TRIBE"", ""DRIVE"", ""STORE"", etc. But we have to avoid using C, A, N.\n\n Let me think of words that have R and E and no C, A, N.\n\n Another idea: We know R is in the word but not at position 2. We can try to put R in position 1? Then E in a different position? Also, we can test more vowels and common consonants.\n\n One good candidate is ""ROUTE"": \n   R in position 1 (which is a new position for R) \n   E in position 5? But wait, the feedback said E is not in position 5? Actually, we must avoid putting E at position 5 because we know it\'s not there.\n\n So let\'s put E in a position between 1 and 4.\n\n Alternatively, let me pick a word that places R and E in new positions and uses other common letters.\n\n Suggestion: ""STRETCH"" is 7 letters, too long. We need 5 letters.\n\n How about ""STORE"": \n   S, T, O, R, E.\n   But note: in ""STORE"", R is in position 4 and E is in position 5. However, we are not allowed to put E at position 5? The feedback from ""crane"" said E is not at position 5? Actually, the feedback was for the fifth letter (E) of ""crane"" being not correct. But it does not mean that E cannot be at position 5? Wait, no: the feedback says the letter E is present in the word but not at that position. So if we put E at position 5 in ""STORE"", it might be that in the secret word E is at position 5? But wait, we know from the first guess that E is not at position 5? Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" says that E is in the word but not at position 5. Therefore, we know that E is in the secret word somewhere else, so if we put E at position 5 now, it must be incorrect? Actually, no: the feedback only told us that in the word ""crane"", the E at position 5 was not the right position. It doesn\'t forbid E from being at position 5? Well, if the secret word had E at position 5, then when we guessed ""crane"", which has E at position 5, we would have gotten a ✓ for E. But we got a \'-\' meaning it is present but not at that position. Therefore, we can deduce that E is definitely not at position 5? So we should avoid placing E at position 5 in our new guess? Actually, we can try to put E in a different position to get more information.\n\n So for ""STORE"":\n   Positions: \n      1: S\n      2: T\n      3: O\n      4: R\n      5: E   -> but we know E is not at position 5? So this would be incorrect? Actually, we can avoid position 5 for E.\n\n So let me choose a word with E at positions 1-4.\n\n Another word: ""TRIED"" -> has E in position 5? No: T, R, I, E, D -> E is at position 4? Actually, ""TRIED"" is T-R-I-E-D: position 1: T, 2: R, 3: I, 4: E, 5: D. \n   But we have R at position 2? And in the first guess we had R at position 2 and it was present but in the wrong position? So wait: the secret word has R but not at position 2. Does that mean R must be in one of the other positions? But when we put R at position 2 again, we would expect a \'-\' again? Maybe we can use that to see if R is at position 2? But no: we know it\'s not at position 2? Actually, the feedback told us that R is not at position 2. So if we put R at position 2 again, we would get a \'-\' again? But we don\'t learn anything new by putting R in the same wrong position? Moreover, we already know R is in the word, so putting it at position 2 again would only confirm it\'s still not placed correctly? But we want to try to put R in a different position to hit the correct one.\n\n So ideally, let\'s place R in a position that we haven\'t tried. We have only tried position 2 for R. So we can try R at positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\n Similarly, we have only tried E at position 5? So we can try E at positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n Therefore, let\'s choose a word that has R at a position other than 2, and E at a position other than 5.\n\n Example: ""DRIVE"": \n   D, R, I, V, E\n   R is at position 2? Then we would get a \'-\' for R again? But we want to try a different position for R? So avoid position 2.\n\n How about ""RODEO""? No, it has E? Actually, no: R, O, D, E, O -> yes, E at position 4.\n\n But ""RODEO"": \n   R at position 1 -> new position for R? \n   O? \n   D? \n   E at position 4? \n   O? \n\n But ""RODEO"" has two O\'s? And we don\'t know if the secret word has O? But we can test O and D.\n\n However, let me think: we haven\'t been given any information about O and D so they are allowed? And we know we must use R and E and avoid C, A, N.\n\n So ""RODEO"" is a valid word? But note: the secret word might contain duplicate letters? But in this case, we don\'t know.\n\n Alternatively, let\'s choose a word without duplicate letters? We can get more information.\n\n Also, let me consider that we have two letters to include: R and E. We need three more.\n\n Let me try ""RESTY"": \n   R at position 1 (new position), E at position 2 (which hasn\'t been tried for E because we\'ve only tried E at position 5). \n   S, T, Y? \n\n But note: E is at position 2? And we don\'t know if E can be there? \n\n Steps:\n\n We want to plan:\n   Position for R: avoid 2 -> try 1, 3, 4, 5.\n   Position for E: avoid 5 -> try 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\n Also, we want to test as many new letters as possible? Because we have only ruled out C, A, N.\n\n Let me choose a word that includes common letters: S, T, etc.\n\n Another candidate: ""RIPES"": \n   R at 1, I, P, E, S? Then E at position 4? S at 5? \n\n But ""RIPES"" is a word? Yes.\n\n However, note that we have two known letters: we are including R and E, and the rest are new (I, P, S).\n\n How about ""STERN"": \n   S, T, E, R, N? But N is disallowed? We know N is not in the word? We cannot use N.\n\n So let\'s avoid forbidden letters: C, A, N? Forbidden letters: C, A, N.\n\n Therefore, any word that includes C, A, or N is invalid? We should not guess a word with these letters because we know they are not in the secret word.\n\n So ""STERN"" has N -> invalid.\n\n Words without C, A, N and that have R and E? And don\'t put R at position 2? And don\'t put E at position 5?\n\n Let me think of common words: \n   ""SERIF"": \n      S, E, R, I, F -> \n        E at position 2? \n        R at position 3? \n        This avoids putting R at position 2 and E at position 5? \n        Positions: \n          1: S\n          2: E -> we haven\'t tried E at position 2? \n          3: R -> we haven\'t tried R at position 3? \n          4: I\n          5: F\n\n   This seems good? \n\n Another: ""RESIN"": cannot because it has N? Disallowed.\n\n Another: ""MERIT"": M, E, R, I, T -> E at 2? R at 3? \n\n But we also haven\'t tested M, I, T? So yes.\n\n However, note: in ""MERIT"", E is at position 2 and R at position 3? \n\n Alternatively, what about ""BEARD"": B, E, A, R, D? But A is disallowed? Cannot use A.\n\n So let me check: ""TERSE"" -> \n   T, E, R, S, E -> duplicates? \n   But it has E at position 2 and 5? And we know E is not at position 5? So we avoid putting E at 5? \n   But here at position 5: E? So we shouldn\'t? Actually, we must avoid position 5 for E? But we can test? However, it would likely be inefficient.\n\n So I prefer ""MERIT"". \n\n Steps:\n   We\'ll guess ""MERIT"": \n        M at position 1 (new letter)\n        E at position 2 (new position for E? Not position 5)\n        R at position 3 (new position for R? Not position 2)\n        I at position 4 (new letter)\n        T at position 5 (new letter)\n\n Then we can get feedback on M, E, R, I, T.\n\n Also, note: if the secret word has E at position 2? Then we\'d get a ✓? And similarly for R.\n\n So let me go with ""MERIT"".\n\n However, note: the first guess had R at position 2 and we got a \'-\', meaning R is in the secret word but not at position 2. Now we are putting R at position 3? Similarly, we are putting E at position 2? We don\'t know if E can be at position 2? It\'s possible? Because we only know E is not at position 5? \n\n Therefore, let\'s proceed with ""MERIT"".\n\n Another candidate: ""RULES"": \n   R at position 1, U, L, E, S -> E at position 4? \n   And we avoid forbidden letters. \n\n Both ""MERIT"" and ""RULES"" are good? But ""RULES"" uses U and L? Which are less common? Maybe? \n\n But ""RULES"" also tests U and L? We don\'t know? So both are valid.\n\n However, let me choose ""MERIT"" because it includes T, which is a very common letter? And M, I? \n\n So guess ""MERIT"".\n\n Therefore, my next guess is ""merit"".\n\n<guess>merit</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  \n- C, A, N are **not** in the secret word (all marked ""x"").  \n- R is in the word but **not in position 2** (marked ""-"").  \n- E is in the word but **not in position 5** (marked ""-"").  \n\nSince R and E are confirmed present, the next guess must:  \n1. Include R and E.  \n2. Avoid C, A, N.  \n3. Place R in a new position (not 2).  \n4. Place E in a new position (not 5).  \n\nThe word ""merit"" meets these criteria:  \n- Positions R (3rd) and E (2nd) differ from the first guess.  \n- Tests new common letters (M, I, T) while excluding C, A, N.  \n\nThis maximizes information gain about letter placements and additional letters.\n\n<guess>merit</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: merit -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(-) R(-) I(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Okay, let me analyze the feedback we\'ve received so far to make the next guess. \n\nFirst, the information from both guesses:\n\nFrom Guess 1 (""crane""):\n- C, A, N not in word\n- R present but not position 2\n- E present but not position 5\n\nFrom Guess 2 (""merit""):\n- M not in word (x)\n- E present but not position 2 (-) → confirms E not position 5 or 2\n- R present but not position 3 (-) → confirms R not position 2 or 3\n- I not in word (x)\n- T not in word (x)\n\nNow we know:\n✅ Present letters: R, E\n⛔ Absent letters: C, A, N, M, I, T\n\nPosition constraints:\n- R cannot be position 2 or 3\n- E cannot be position 2 or 5\n\nAvailable letters: Must include R and E, avoid C/A/N/M/I/T. That leaves lots of options: B,D,F,G,H,K,O,P,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z,and maybe others.\n\nGiven R must be in positions 1,4 or 5 (since 2/3 excluded), and E must be in positions 1,3 or 4 (since 2/5 excluded).\n\nPossible word pattern: 5 letters including R and E, using only unused consonants/vowels.\n\nNeed to maximize information: Should test new common letters like S,D,O,L etc.\n\nConsidering words:\n- ""RODEO"" → contains O/D/E/R? But O repeated and we don\'t know if duplicates allowed. Also E position? Wait: R-O-D-E-O → positions: R(1), O(2), D(3), E(4), O(5). E position 4 → allowed. But ""O"" appears twice - if secret word has only one O, we might get false feedback? Avoid for now? But it\'s possible.\n\nBetter options? Trying:\n- ""POSER"": P-O-S-E-R → has S,P,O,R,E. Positions: E at 4? R at 5? Both new positions. Tests P,O,S.\n- Checks: R at position 5 (new), E at 4 (new). No conflicting letters. That could be good.\n\nAnother option: ""LOSER"". But L not tested? We get ""L"" info? Actually same structure: L-O-S-E-R → E at 4, R at 5.\n\nBut note: We only have 6 total guesses. We used 2, have 4 left? Since we\'re on guess 3.\n\nBut wait: feedback for ""merit"" showed E(-) at position 2 - that means E exists elsewhere? So yes, E is in word but not at position 2. Similarly R not at position 2 or 3? So we are narrowing down? We know R must be at pos 1,4,5 and E at pos 1,3,4? Since E cannot be at position 2 or 5? And R cannot be at 2 or 3?\n\nAlso, secret word has these two letters still? We haven\'t placed them? So we need to focus on placing R and E? Also, the word has 5 letters? We know two letters? The other three letters are unknown? And not among the excluded letters? So a lot possible? Better to choose a word with more new letters? So ""POSER"" tests P O S? But note, we haven\'t tested these? So they could be in or out? Good to test.\n\nBut also possible: ""FORES"". F-O-R-E-S → R at position 3 → which was excluded? Because from ""merit"", R cannot be at position 3? So we must not put R at position 3? ""FORES"" has R at position 3 → invalid? Because we know R not at position 3? So cannot test words putting R in known wrong positions? So ""FORES"" invalid? Similarly, we cannot put E in position 2 or 5? Or R in 2 or 3? So ""POSER"": R at position 5? Which is new? And E at position 4? Also new? So that works.\n\nAnother possibility: ""ROUGH"". But no E? Must include E? So invalid.\n\nAlternative word: ""OILER"" → but I not in word? And we have I excluded? So invalid? Because I is absent? Cannot use I? So discard.\n\nAny better? ""POWER"" → no E? Wait, has E? P-O-W-E-R? E at 4? R at 5? And includes W? But ""POWER"" is five letters? Positions: P(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), R(5)? That seems good? But does it have any known absent letters? C,A,N,M,I,T - none used? So valid? Plus tests P,O,W? \n\nBut compare to ""POSER"": also tests P,O,S? S is more common? Maybe better? Alternatively, ""POSER"" also has S? Which is common? Maybe ""POSER"" better? But ""POWER"" includes W? Which is less common? So perhaps ""POSER"" better?\n\nBut note: ""POSER"" has S? Could test S? While ""POWER"" tests W? I think S is more frequent? So prefer ""POSER""? Or ""ROUSE"" → R-O-U-S-E → R at pos1? O at2? U at3? S at4? E at5 → but E at5 not allowed? Because we know E not at position 5? So cannot use position 5 for E? So discard.\n\nThus ""POSER"": E at position 4? Which is new? R at position 5? New? So positions: \n- Position 1: P? New? \n- Position 2: O? New? \n- Position 3: S? New? \n- Position 4: E → attempting E at position 4? Which is an allowed position? \n- Position 5: R → attempting R at position 5? Which is allowed? \n\nPlus tests new letters P,O,S? Which are common? \n\nSo let\'s go with ""POSER"".\n\nIn summary: \n- Previous constraints handled? \n- Includes R and E? In new positions? \n- Uses all new letters? \n- Avoids forbidden letters? Yes?Based on the feedback:\n\n**Feedback Analysis**\n1. **New Absent Letters**: M, I, T (so far: C, A, N, M, I, T excluded)\n2. **Confirmed Presence**: \n   - R is in the secret word but now confirmed *not at positions 2 or 3* (received ""-"" in both guesses). \n   - E is in the secret word but confirmed *not at positions 2 or 5* (received ""-"" in both guesses).\n3. **Position Constraints**:\n   - R can only be at positions 1, 4, or 5.\n   - E can only be at positions 1, 3, or 4.\n\n**Next Guess Strategy**\n- Must include **R and E**, exclude C/A/N/M/I/T.\n- Prioritize **new common consonants/vowels**: S, O, D, L, P (untested).\n- Place R/E in **new valid positions**: E at 3/4? R at 1/4/5?\n- Ideal word structure: Tests 3 new letters + R/E?  \n- Top candidate: **""POSER""**  \n  - P (new), O (new), S (new), E (position 4? new slot), R (position 5? new slot)  \n  - Tests E at pos 4?

We know the following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, M, I, T, P, O, S.\n\nWe have to choose a word that fits: _ _ _ E R, and uses letters that are not in the excluded list.\n\nExcluded letters: C, A, N, M, I, T, P, O, S.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe also know that the word must be a valid English word.\n\nWe have to make a guess that uses only available letters and fits the pattern.\n\nLet\'s think of words ending with ""ER"". Common words: \n- like ""TIGER"" but T is excluded? T is absent, so no.\n- ""WATER"" but W is available? But A is excluded? A is absent, so no.\n- ""PAPER"" but P and A are excluded? No.\n- ""LOWER"" but O is excluded? O is absent, so no.\n\nWe need to avoid the excluded letters.\n\nPossible words: \n- ""LUGER"": L, U, G, E, R -> but we have E and R fixed? So the word would be ? ? ? E R, so the first three letters are L, U, G? But ""LUGER"" is a word? Yes, meaning a type of pistol or a sled.\n\nCheck letters: L, U, G are all in the available set? Yes.\n\nBut we have to consider: we don\'t know if L, U, G are in the word? We are testing them.\n\nAnother word: ""JEWEL""? But that ends with L? Not ""ER"". We need ""ER"" at the end.\n\nAnother: ""BOXER"" -> B, O, X, E, R -> but O is excluded? O is absent, so no.\n\nAnother: ""FEWER"" -> F, E, W, E, R -> but we have two E\'s? The pattern is _ _ _ E R, so the third letter must be a letter? And we have E at position 4? But ""FEWER"" has E at position 2 and 4? But we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s? It might? But in our pattern, we only have one E at position 4? So if we guess ""FEWER"", it would be F at 1, E at 2, W at 3, E at 4, R at 5? But we know E is at position 4? So the E at position 2 would be a new E? But we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s? It\'s possible? But we have to avoid using excluded letters? E is not excluded? But we know E is in the word? But we don\'t know if it appears twice? However, in the feedback so far, we only have one E? But that doesn\'t mean it can\'t be two? So we can try? But let\'s see: the pattern is fixed for positions 4 and 5: E and R? So the first three are unknown? But in ""FEWER"", the first three are F, E, W? Then E at 4? So the word would be F E W E R? But we are guessing the first three as F, E, W? And then E and R? But we are testing E at position 2? Which we know from guess2 that E is not at position 2? Because in ""merit"", E at position 2 got a \'-\', meaning E is in the word but not at position 2? So if we put E at position 2 again, it would be incorrect? And we would get a \'-\' again? But we already know that? So it\'s a waste? We should avoid putting E in a position we know it\'s not? So we should not put E at position 2? Similarly, we know E is not at position 5? But we are not putting it there? So for the first three positions, we should not put E? Because we know E is at position 4? And we don\'t have information about other E\'s? But we know E is not at position 2? And we haven\'t tried position 1 or 3? But we can try? However, we are trying to find the first three letters? And we know E is at position 4? So the first three positions are not E? Because if they were E, then we would have multiple E\'s? But we don\'t know? So to be safe, we should avoid putting E in the first three? Because we are not sure? But we can use E? But we know that position 2 is invalid for E? So we can put E at position 1 or 3? But if we put E at position 1, then we have E at 1 and E at 4? That\'s possible? But we don\'t know? \n\nBut let\'s reconsider: we have only one E confirmed? But the feedback doesn\'t tell us the count? So it could be multiple? But to maximize information, we should avoid using E again? Because we already know one E? And we know its position? So we can focus on finding the other letters? So it\'s better to use three new letters for the first three positions? Without E? Because if we use E, we might not get new information? For example, if we put E at position 1, and if it is present, we get a ✓? But we already know E is in the word? So it doesn\'t help? And if it\'s not, we get x? But we know E is in the word? So it must be present? So we would get a \'-\' if it\'s not at that position? Or if it is, we get ✓? But we are trying to find the first three? So it might be better to use non-E letters? \n\nTherefore, for the next guess, we should use three new letters from the available set for positions 1,2,3? And then E and R at 4 and 5? \n\nSo the word should be: [new1] [new2] [new3] E R\n\nAnd new1, new2, new3 are from B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? But excluding the ones we already know are absent? But we haven\'t tested any of these? So all are possible? \n\nWe need to choose a valid English word that fits this pattern? \n\nPossible words:\n- ""LUGER"" -> L U G E R -> valid? Yes? \n- ""FEWER"" -> but that has E at position 2? Which we want to avoid? Because we know E is not at position 2? So if we use ""FEWER"", we have E at position 2? Which we know is wrong? So we would get a \'-\' for E at position 2? And we already know that? So it doesn\'t give new information? And we are using one of the positions for E? Which we could have used for a new letter? So not efficient? \n\nSimilarly, ""JEWER""? Not a word? \n\n""BOXER"" has O? Excluded? \n\n""BAKER"" has A? Excluded? \n\n""MAKER"" has M and A? Excluded? \n\nSo let\'s list words ending with ""ER"" that have three letters from the available set? \n\nAvailable: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nWords:\n- ""LUGER"": L, U, G -> all available? \n- ""LIVER"": but I is excluded? I is absent? So no? \n- ""LOWER"": O is excluded? \n- ""DIVER"": I excluded? \n- ""RACER"": A and C excluded? \n- ""FLYER"": F, L, Y -> but Y is available? And ""FLYER"" is a word? But pattern: F L Y E R? So positions: 1:F, 2:L, 3:Y, 4:E, 5:R? \n  But we know E is at position 4? So that\'s fixed? And R at 5? So yes? \n  But we have to check if F, L, Y are allowed? They are not excluded? So yes? \n- ""FUZER""? Not a word? \n- ""JEWER""? Not a word? \n- ""HEWER"": H, E, W, E, R? But that would be H at 1, E at 2? But we know E is not at position 2? So if we use ""HEWER"", we have E at position 2? Which is invalid? So we get a \'-\' for E at 2? And we already know? So not good? \n- ""WAGER"": A excluded? \n- ""HOVER"": O excluded? \n- ""LIKER"": I and K? I excluded? \n- ""DOPER"": O excluded? \n- ""GAMER"": A excluded? \n- ""BUYER"": B, U, Y, E, R -> B, U, Y are available? And ""BUYER"" is a word? Pattern: B U Y E R? So positions: 1:B, 2:U, 3:Y, 4:E, 5:R? \n  This seems good? \n- ""LAYER"": A excluded? \n- ""POWER"": O excluded? \n- ""TOTER"": O and T excluded? \n- ""WISER"": I excluded? \n- ""USER"": U, S, E, R? But S is excluded? And also, it\'s 4 letters? We need 5? ""USER"" is 4? \n- ""USHER"": U, S, H, E, R -> but S excluded? \n- ""FIXER"": I excluded? \n- ""JOKER"": O excluded? \n- ""VOTER"": O and T excluded? \n- ""WAFER"": A excluded? \n- ""WIDER"": I excluded? \n- ""WISER"": I excluded? \n- ""WOMAN"": not ending with ER? \n\nSo possible words from above: \n- ""LUGER"" (L, U, G)\n- ""FLYER"" (F, L, Y)\n- ""BUYER"" (B, U, Y)\n\nAlso, ""JUDGER""? Too long? 6 letters? \n\n""QUEER"": Q, U, E, E, R -> but we have E at position 3 and 4? But we are putting E at position 3? And we know E is at position 4? So if we put E at position 3, we might get a ✓ or -? But we know E is at position 4? So if we put E at position 3, and if the word has only one E? Then we get a \'-\' for position 3? But if it has two E\'s? Then we might get a ✓? But we don\'t know? Also, ""QUEER"" has Q and U? But Q is available? \n\nBut let\'s see the pattern: Q U E E R? So positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:E, 4:E, 5:R? But we know position 4 is E? So that\'s fixed? But position 3 is E? So we are testing E at position 3? Which we haven\'t tried? But we know E is not at position 2 or 5? But position 3 is possible? \n\nHowever, we are using one of the first three positions for E? Instead of a new letter? So it might be less efficient? \n\nSimilarly, ""QUEER"" has two E\'s? But we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s? \n\nTo maximize information, it\'s better to use three new letters? So I think ""LUGER"", ""FLYER"", or ""BUYER"" are better? \n\nAmong these, which one to choose? \n\nWe can choose based on common letters? But in the available set, common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, L? Vowels: U? \n\n""LUGER"" has L, U, G? \n""FLYER"" has F, L, Y? \n""BUYER"" has B, U, Y? \n\n""FLYER"" has Y? Which can be a vowel? \n\nBut we don\'t know which are more common? \n\nSince we have limited guesses, we can pick one? \n\nAnother word: ""DUPER""? D, U, P, E, R? But P is excluded? P is absent? So no? \n\n""HYPER"": H, Y, P, E, R? P excluded? \n\n""LYCER""? Not a word? \n\n""JUKER""? Not a word? \n\nSo the three options: ""LUGER"", ""FLYER"", ""BUYER"". \n\nI think ""BUYER"" is a common word? But let\'s see: we can also consider ""JUDGE""? Not ending with ER? \n\nAnother: ""HOMER""? O excluded? \n\n""LUBER""? Not a word? \n\nSo I think we have to choose from the three. \n\nLet me pick ""FLYER"" because it tests F, L, Y? \n\nBut note: in ""FLYER"", the Y is at position 3? \n\nWe can also consider ""BLUER"": B, L, U, E, R -> but that has E at position 4? And R at 5? And B, L, U? All available? And ""BLUER"" is a word? \n\nYes, ""BLUER"" is a valid word? \n\nSo now we have:\n- ""LUGER"": L, U, G\n- ""FLYER"": F, L, Y\n- ""BUYER"": B, U, Y\n- ""BLUER"": B, L, U\n\n""BLUER"" uses B, L, U? \n\nWe can choose any? \n\nBut note: we have only 4 guesses left? We are on guess 4? \n\nWe can choose one that covers more common letters? \n\nCommon letters: L, U, B, F? \n\nI think ""BLUER"" is good? But it has U? \n\nAlternatively, ""FLYER"" has Y? Which is less common? \n\nBut let\'s pick ""BLUER"" because it uses B and L? \n\nBut we have to make a guess? \n\nAnother idea: we know the word ends with ""ER"", so we can try to think of common words? \n\nBut with the available letters? \n\n""EAGER""? A excluded? \n\n""ELDER""? E at position 1? But we don\'t know if E can be at position 1? We haven\'t tried? But we know E is at position 4? So if we put E at position 1, it might be a second E? Or not? \n\nBut in ""ELDER"", we have E at 1 and E at 4? But we are not sure? \n\nBut we are trying to avoid using E? \n\nSo back to the pattern: _ _ _ E R\n\nLet me choose ""BLUER"" as the next guess? \n\nSo guess: ""BLUER""\n\nBut ""BLUER"" is B L U E R? \n\nPositions: \n1: B\n2: L\n3: U\n4: E (which we know is correct? So we expect a ✓ for E? But we are guessing, so we will get feedback? \n5: R (correct? So ✓)\n\nBut we are testing B, L, U? \n\nIf the word is ""BLUER"", then we win? \n\nBut if not, we get feedback on B, L, U? \n\nSo it\'s a good guess? \n\nSimilarly, if we guess ""FLYER"", we test F, L, Y? \n\nI think ""BLUER"" is fine? \n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we have: we know E and R are fixed? So we are only guessing the first three? \n\nSo I\'ll go with ""BLUER"". \n\nBut note: ""BLUER"" has the same structure? \n\nSo <guess>bluer</guess> \n\nBut we must ensure it\'s a valid word? Yes? \n\nAlternatively, to cover more letters?

So we must not put L at position 1? \n\nSimilarly, we cannot put any other letter at position 2? Because L is fixed there? \n\nSo the pattern is fixed: position 2 is L, position 4 is E, position 5 is R? \n\nSo we only need to guess position 1 and position 3? \n\nSo the word is: [letter1] L [letter3] E R\n\nAnd letter1 and letter3 are from the available set? \n\nNow, ""FLYER"" has F at 1 and Y at 3? \n\nAnother word: ""HOVER""?

So if we put E at position 3, it might be a second E? \n\nBut ""FLEER"" is a word? Meaning to laugh mockingly? \n\nPattern: F L E E R? So positions: 1:F, 2:L, 3:E, 4:E, 5:R? \n\nBut we know position 4 is E? So that\'s fixed? But position 3 is E? So we are putting E at position 3? \n\nBut we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s?

But we already know E is in the word? So it doesn\'t give new information about presence? Only about position? \n\nBut if the word has only one E? Then we would get a \'-\' for position 3? Or if it has two, we might get a ✓? \n\nBut we are trying to find the word? \n\nHowever, we are using one of the positions for E? Instead of a new letter? So it might be less efficient? \n\nTherefore, ""FLYER"" is better because it tests two new letters: F and Y? \n\nAnother word: ""GLEET""? Not ER? \n\n""GLUEY""? Not ER? \n\nSo I think ""FLYER"" is a good choice? \n\nBut let\'s see: we have not tested F and Y? And we are testing them in positions 1 and 3? \n\nSo I\'ll go with ""FLYER"". \n\nBut note: if the secret word is ""FLYER"", then we win? \n\nIf not, we get feedback on F and Y? \n\nSo <guess>flyer</guess> \n\nBut wait, we have to make sure it\'s valid? Yes? \n\nAlternatively, is there a word like ""DEUCE""?

We are given the feedback for the fifth guess ""flyer"":
- F: absent (x)
- L: correct (✓) at position 2
- Y: absent (x)
- E: correct (✓) at position 4
- R: correct (✓) at position 5

So the secret word pattern remains: _ L _ E R

We now know that F and Y are absent. So we add F and Y to the list of absent letters.

Absent letters: C, A, N, M, I, T, P, O, S, B, U, F, Y

Available letters: D, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z

The secret word is: [position1] L [position3] E R

We need to fill the first and third positions with letters from the available set.

We must choose a word that fits this pattern and uses available letters.

Possible words:

We need an English word of the form: X L Z E R, where X and Z are from the available letters: D, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z

Possible words:

- ""GLYPH""? Not ER? And G and H? But pattern not ER? 
- ""GLEEK""? Not ER? 
- ""GLUME""? Not standard? 
- ""HEIGH""? Not ER? 
- ""HINGE""? Not ER? 
- ""DENSE""? But we know N is excluded? N absent? 
- ""DEUCE""? Not ER? 
- ""JESSE""? Ends with E? But not ER? 
- ""LEMEL""? Not ER? 
- ""LETHE""? Not ER? 
- ""LEVEL""? Not ER? 
- ""LIBEL""? But we have L at position 1? But we know L is at position 2? So no? 
- One possible word: ""DATER""? But A excluded? 
- ""DETER""? E at position 3? But we have E at position 4? So if we put E at position 3? But we know E is at position 4? So if the word has two E's? 

Look for words ending with ""ER"", with L at position 2? 

Specifically, the pattern must be: first letter, then L, then third letter, then E, then R? 

Words: 
- ""ALTER"": A excluded? 
- ""ARMER""? A excluded? 
- ""EGGER"": E at 1? And G? But pattern: E L G E R? Wait, ""EGGER"" is E G G E R? Not matching? Because position 2 is G? Not L? 
- We need position 2 to be L? So words like ""ELDER""? But we have L at position 2? So ""ELDER"" has L at position 2? Wait, ""ELDER"": E L D E R? 
  - Position 1: E
  - Position 2: L
  - Position 3: D
  - Position 4: E
  - Position 5: R? 
  So ""ELDER"" fits the pattern: E L D E R? 

But note: we have E at position 1? But we know E is at position 4? So if the word has two E's? It might? 

And the letters: E and D? We have to check if E is allowed? We know E is in the word, so we can use it? But we are testing E at a new position? 

Also, D is available? 

But in the pattern, we are putting E at position 1? Which we haven't tried? We only know E is not at positions 2 or 5 (from earlier feedback), but position 1 and 3 are possible for another E? 

Similarly, in guess1, E was at position 5? Got '-' meaning E is present but not at position 5? 
In guess2, E at position2? Got '-' meaning present but not at position 2? 
Now we are trying E at position1? 

So ""ELDER"" could be a candidate? But we also need to check absent letters? ""ELDER"" uses E, L, D, E, R? But L and R and E are already known? And D is new? 

But the word has two E's? 

Another word: ""FILER""? But F and I excluded? 

""GLEED""? Not ER? 

""HELED"": H E L E D? But ends with ED? Not ER? 

""JETES""? Not ER? 

""KNEED""? N excluded? 

""LEGER"": L E G E R? But we have L at position 1? But we need L at position 2? 
""LEGER"" has L at position 1? Then E at 2? So no? 

""LUBRA""? Not ER? 

""LYTTA""? Not ER? 

""NEVER"": N excluded? 

""REEDY""? Not ER? 

""SEINE""? Not ER? 

""TEMPO""? Not ER? 

""VELAR""? V E L A R? But A excluded? 

""WEIGH""? Not ER? 

""XERIC""? Not ER? 

""ZESTY""? Not ER? 

So back to ""ELDER"": E L D E R? 

It uses E at position 1? But we are guessing the word? 

We could try ""HIDER"": H I D E R? But I excluded? 

Another possibility: ""DATER""? A excluded? 

""DEWAR""? But A excluded? Wait, ""DEWAR"" is D E W A R? A excluded? 

""DOZER"": O excluded? 

""FAKER"": A and F excluded? 

""GAZER"": A excluded? 

So few words? 

What about ""HELLER""? Too long? 

""CELLER""? C excluded? 

""HELLER"" is 6 letters? 

Perhaps ""elder"" is the best? 

Another word: ""OLDER""? O L D E R -> O at position1? But O is excluded? 

""ULCER""? U and C excluded? 

""BEVER""? B and E? But B excluded? 

So ""ELDER"" seems viable? 

But note: we are using E at position1? But we already know E is in the word? So if we use ""ELDER"", we are risking that the word has two E's? Or, if the secret word has only one E at position4, then position1 being E would be incorrect? 

But we can use it? 

Alternatively, a word without E at the beginning? 

But what word can we form? 

Perhaps ""GLYPH""? Doesn't end with ER? 

Or ""WHEER""? Not a word? 

""WHERE""? W H E R E? But it ends with E? Not ER? 

""WHERR""? Not a word? 

""KEREL""? But K E R E L? Doesn't match the pattern? Position 2 should be L? 

We need position 2 to be L? 

So words like ""DLGER""? Not a word? 

Only ""ELDER"" comes to mind? 

Another: ""LEVER"": L E V E R? But this has L at position1? But we need L at position2? So ""LEVER"" would be L at1, E at2? But we need L at2? As in ""x L y E R""? So no? 

""ALDER"": A excluded? 

""ELVER"": E L V E R? Similar to ""ELDER""? 

""ELVER"" is a word? Meaning a young eel? 

Pattern: E L V E R? 

So it has E at1, L at2, V at3, E at4, R at5? 

That fits? And V is available? 

Similarly, ""ELDER"": E L D E R? 

So two candidates: ""ELDER"" and ""ELVER""? 

""ELDER"" uses D? ""ELVER"" uses V? 

Both D and V are available? 

We can choose one? 

For example, ""ELDER"" uses D? ""ELVER"" uses V? 

Since we have no information on D or V? 

But we need to guess? 

Also, note that if the word is ""ELDER"", then we have D as the third letter? 

Similarly, ""ELVER"" has V? 

We can choose ""ELDER"" as it is more common? 

But ""ELVER"" is valid? 

We are on guess 6? The last guess? 

We need to get it right? 

So let's choose ""ELDER""? 

But wait, we haven't tested E at position1? It might not be present? 

But we know E is at position4? So putting E at position1 might indicate there is another E? Or if there isn't, we'll get an absent? 

But we know E is in the word? And we are putting it at a different position? 

So we'll get feedback: if E is at position1 for real? We get ✓? Or if not? But if absent? But we know E is in the word? So it must be present? So we'll get '-' meaning it is present but not in position1? Or if it is at position1? We get ✓? 

Similarly for the third letter? 

So if we guess ""ELDER"", we might get:

- Position1: E -> if correct? ✓? Or incorrect? '-'? But if incorrect, we know E is not at position1? And the letter is D? If absent? Or present elsewhere? 

Because we have only two positions unknown? 

But we can deduce? 

But let's guess ""ELDER"" as it is a common word? 

So <guess>elder</guess> 

But note: another possibility? ""ENTER""? But N excluded? 

""ESTER""? S excluded? 

So I think ""ELDER"" or ""ELVER""? 

Perhaps ""ELDER"" is better? 

But in the available letters, both D and V are unused? 

So we choose ""ELDER"". 

Thus, next guess: ""elder"" 

If it's not, we might lose? But we have one guess left? Guess 6 is the last? 

We are on guess 6? 

The conversation said: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess."" and we are at the sixth guess? 

Yes? 

So let's go with ""ELDER"".

### Analysis of Feedback
- **Guess 5: ""flyer""**  
  - F: Absent (x) → Added to excluded letters.  
  - L: Correct (✓) at position 2 (already fixed).  
  - Y: Absent (x) → Added to excluded letters.  
  - E: Correct (✓) at position 4 (fixed).  
  - R: Correct (✓) at position 5 (fixed).  

### Key Insights
1. **Secret Word Pattern**: `_ L _ E R`  
   - Position 2: **L** (confirmed).  
   - Position 4: **E** (confirmed).  
   - Position 5: **R** (confirmed).  
   - Positions 1 and 3: Unknown.  

2. **Updated Excluded Letters**:  
   C, A, N, M, I, T, P, O, S, B, U, F, Y.  

3. **Remaining Possible Letters**:  
   D, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z.  

4. **Strategy for Final Guess**:  
   - Positions 1 and 3 must be filled with letters from the remaining pool.  
   - Ideal word: **""ELDER""** (E L D E R):  
     - Tests **E** at position 1 (unknown placement) and **D** at position 3 (new letter).  
     - Maintains fixed L (position 2), E (position 4), R (position 5).  
     - High feasibility: ""elder"" is a valid English word matching the pattern.

### Why ""elder""?
- If correct, solves the puzzle.  
- If incorrect, feedback will reveal:  
  - Whether **E** exists at position 1 (or position 3 holds D).  
  - Confirms/refutes usage of D.  
- Limited remaining letters make this high-percentage guess.  
<guess>elder</guess>",elder,"We are given the feedback for the fifth guess ""flyer"":
- F: absent (x)
- L: correct (✓) at position 2

So the secret word pattern remains: _ L _ E R

We now know that F and Y are absent. So we add F and Y to the list of absent letters.

Absent letters: C, A, N, M, I, T, P, O, S, B, U, F, Y

Available letters: D, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z

The secret word is: [position1] L [position3] E R

We need to fill the first and third positions with letters from the available set.

We must choose a word that fits this pattern and uses available letters.

Possible words:

We need an English word of the form: X L Z E R, where X and Z are from the available letters: D, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z

Possible words:

- ""GLYPH""? Not ER? And G and H? But pattern not ER?

- ""GLUME""? Not standard? 
- ""HEIGH""? Not ER? 
- ""HINGE""? Not ER?

- ""LETHE""? Not ER? 
- ""LEVEL""? Not ER?

- One possible word: ""DATER""? But A excluded? 
- ""DETER""? E at position 3? But we have E at position 4? So if we put E at position 3? But we know E is at position 4? So if the word has two E's? 

Look for words ending with ""ER"", with L at position 2? 

Specifically, the pattern must be: first letter, then L, then third letter, then E, then R? 

Words: 
- ""ALTER"": A excluded? 
- ""ARMER""? A excluded? 
- ""EGGER"": E at 1? And G? But pattern: E L G E R? Wait, ""EGGER"" is E G G E R? Not matching? Because position 2 is G? Not L? 
- We need position 2 to be L? So words like ""ELDER""? But we have L at position 2? So ""ELDER"" has L at position 2? Wait, ""ELDER"": E L D E R? 
  - Position 1: E
  - Position 2: L
  - Position 3: D
  - Position 4: E
  - Position 5: R? 
  So ""ELDER"" fits the pattern: E L D E R? 

But note: we have E at position 1? But we know E is at position 4? So if the word has two E's? It might? 

And the letters: E and D? We have to check if E is allowed? We know E is in the word, so we can use it? But we are testing E at a new position? 

Also, D is available? 

But in the pattern, we are putting E at position 1? Which we haven't tried? We only know E is not at positions 2 or 5 (from earlier feedback), but position 1 and 3 are possible for another E? 

Similarly, in guess1, E was at position 5? Got '-' meaning E is present but not at position 5? 
In guess2, E at position2? Got '-' meaning present but not at position 2? 
Now we are trying E at position1? 

So ""ELDER"" could be a candidate? But we also need to check absent letters? ""ELDER"" uses E, L, D, E, R? But L and R and E are already known? And D is new? 

But the word has two E's? 

Another word: ""FILER""? But F and I excluded? 

""GLEED""? Not ER? 

""HELED"": H E L E D? But ends with ED? Not ER? 

""JETES""? Not ER? 

""KNEED""? N excluded? 

""LEGER"": L E G E R? But we have L at position 1? But we need L at position 2? 
""LEGER"" has L at position 1? Then E at 2? So no? 

""LUBRA""? Not ER? 

""LYTTA""? Not ER? 

""NEVER"": N excluded? 

""REEDY""? Not ER? 

""SEINE""? Not ER? 

""TEMPO""? Not ER? 

""VELAR""? V E L A R? But A excluded? 

""WEIGH""? Not ER? 

""XERIC""? Not ER? 

""ZESTY""? Not ER? 

So back to ""ELDER"": E L D E R? 

It uses E at position 1? But we are guessing the word? 

We could try ""HIDER"": H I D E R? But I excluded? 

Another possibility: ""DATER""? A excluded? 

""DEWAR""? But A excluded? Wait, ""DEWAR"" is D E W A R? A excluded? 

""DOZER"": O excluded? 

""FAKER"": A and F excluded? 

""GAZER"": A excluded? 

So few words? 

What about ""HELLER""? Too long? 

""CELLER""? C excluded? 

""HELLER"" is 6 letters? 

Perhaps ""elder"" is the best? 

Another word: ""OLDER""? O L D E R -> O at position1? But O is excluded? 

""ULCER""? U and C excluded? 

""BEVER""? B and E? But B excluded? 

So ""ELDER"" seems viable? 

But note: we are using E at position1? But we already know E is in the word? So if we use ""ELDER"", we are risking that the word has two E's? Or, if the secret word has only one E at position4, then position1 being E would be incorrect? 

But we can use it? 

Alternatively, a word without E at the beginning? 

But what word can we form? 

Perhaps ""GLYPH""? Doesn't end with ER? 

Or ""WHEER""? Not a word? 

""WHERE""? W H E R E? But it ends with E? Not ER? 

""WHERR""? Not a word? 

""KEREL""? But K E R E L? Doesn't match the pattern? Position 2 should be L? 

We need position 2 to be L? 

So words like ""DLGER""? Not a word? 

Only ""ELDER"" comes to mind? 

Another: ""LEVER"": L E V E R? But this has L at position1? But we need L at position2? So ""LEVER"" would be L at1, E at2? But we need L at2? As in ""x L y E R""? So no? 

""ALDER"": A excluded? 

""ELVER"": E L V E R? Similar to ""ELDER""? 

""ELVER"" is a word? Meaning a young eel? 

Pattern: E L V E R? 

So it has E at1, L at2, V at3, E at4, R at5? 

That fits? And V is available? 

Similarly, ""ELDER"": E L D E R? 

So two candidates: ""ELDER"" and ""ELVER""? 

""ELDER"" uses D? ""ELVER"" uses V? 

Both D and V are available? 

We can choose one? 

For example, ""ELDER"" uses D? ""ELVER"" uses V? 

Since we have no information on D or V? 

But we need to guess? 

Also, note that if the word is ""ELDER"", then we have D as the third letter? 

Similarly, ""ELVER"" has V? 

We can choose ""ELDER"" as it is more common? 

But ""ELVER"" is valid? 

We are on guess 6? The last guess? 

We need to get it right? 

So let's choose ""ELDER""? 

But wait, we haven't tested E at position1? It might not be present? 

But we know E is at position4? So putting E at position1 might indicate there is another E? Or if there isn't, we'll get an absent? 

But we know E is in the word? And we are putting it at a different position? 

So we'll get feedback: if E is at position1 for real? We get ✓? Or if not? But if absent? But we know E is in the word? So it must be present? So we'll get '-' meaning it is present but not in position1? Or if it is at position1? We get ✓? 

Similarly for the third letter? 

So if we guess ""ELDER"", we might get:

- Position1: E -> if correct? ✓? Or incorrect? '-'? But if incorrect, we know E is not at position1? And the letter is D? If absent? Or present elsewhere? 

Because we have only two positions unknown? 

But we can deduce? 

But let's guess ""ELDER"" as it is a common word? 

So <guess>elder</guess> 

But note: another possibility? ""ENTER""? But N excluded? 

""ESTER""? S excluded? 

So I think ""ELDER"" or ""ELVER""? 

Perhaps ""ELDER"" is better? 

But in the available letters, both D and V are unused? 

So we choose ""ELDER"". 

Thus, next guess: ""elder"" 

If it's not, we might lose? But we have one guess left? Guess 6 is the last? 

We are on guess 6? 

The conversation said: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess."" and we are at the sixth guess? 

Yes? 

So let's go with ""ELDER"".### Analysis of Feedback
- **Guess 5: ""flyer""**  
  - F: Absent (x) → Added to excluded letters.  
  - L: Correct (✓) at position 2 (already fixed).  
  - Y: Absent (x) → Added to excluded letters.  
  - E: Correct (✓) at position 4 (fixed).  
  - R: Correct (✓) at position 5 (fixed).  

### Key Insights
1. **Secret Word Pattern**: `_ L _ E R`  
   - Position 2: **L** (confirmed).  
   - Position 4: **E** (confirmed).  
   - Position 5: **R** (confirmed).  
   - Positions 1 and 3: Unknown.  

2. **Updated Excluded Letters**:  
   C, A, N, M, I, T, P, O, S, B, U, F, Y.  

3. **Remaining Possible Letters**:  
   D, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z.  

4. **Strategy for Final Guess**:  
   - Positions 1 and 3 must be filled with letters from the remaining pool.  
   - Ideal word: **""ELDER""** (E L D E R):  
     - Tests **E** at position 1 (unknown placement) and **D** at position 3 (new letter).  
     - Maintains fixed L (position 2), E (position 4), R (position 5).  
     - High feasibility: ""elder"" is a valid English word matching the pattern.

### Why ""elder""?
- If correct, solves the puzzle.  
- If incorrect, feedback will reveal:  
  - Whether **E** exists at position 1 (or position 3 holds D).  
  - Confirms/refutes usage of D.  
- Limited remaining letters make this high-percentage guess.",Guess 6: elder -> FEEDBACK: E(✓) L(✓) D(✓) E(✓) R(✓),SUCCESS
