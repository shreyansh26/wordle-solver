We are starting the game. We need to make the first guess.
 Since there is no prior information, we should pick a word that has common letters and a good distribution to maximize information.
 Commonly used starting words in Wordle are words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRATE"", ""ROATE"", etc., because they contain common letters and have a mix of vowels and consonants.

 However, note that the rules we've been given use BRISK as an example. But let's stick to a general strategy.

 One popular choice is ""ROATE"" (which is an accounting term meaning the accumulated earnings of an entity) but it's not the most common.
 Alternatively, ""RAISE"" is a good starter because it has two vowels and three common consonants.

 Another candidate is ""CRANE"". Let me pick ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are all common.

 But note: the example used BRISK and we saw that S and R were in the word. So maybe a word with multiple common letters?

 However, without any feedback, we just need a word that will give us a lot of information.

 I'll choose ""RAISE"" because it has two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (R, S) which are all common.

 Alternatively, let's look at the most common letters in 5-letter English words: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, etc.

 We can choose a word that covers as many of these as possible.

 Another popular starting word is ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E). It has S, L, A, T, E.

 Let me consider that with ""RAISE"": R, A, I, S, E -> covers R, A, I, S, E.

 With ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E -> covers S, L, A, T, E.

 Both are good. I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it doesn't repeat letters and has a good mix.

 However, note that the feedback in the example used BRISK and the first guess was STORM. But that was an example.

 For the sake of this, let me choose ""CRANE"". It was used in the example? Actually, it's a common starter.

 But wait, the example had BRISK and the first guess STORM had S and R, which matched. CRANE has R and A and E which are vowels and R.

 However, let's stick with a word that has high-frequency letters.

 According to many sources, a good starting word is ""CRATE"" for English. But I'll pick ""CRANE"" to get a vowel (A) and E.

 Actually, ""RAISE"" has more common letters? Let me consider:

 Frequency order: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, ...

 RAISE: R, A, I, S, E -> contains E, A, R, I, S -> five of the top ten.

 CRANE: C, R, A, N, E -> contains E, A, R, N, C -> also five of the top ten but includes C and N which are slightly less frequent than I and S.

 I think RAISE is slightly better because I and S are more frequent than N and C.

 But note: the feedback symbols: 
 - We want to avoid repeating letters because that gives less information.

 Both words have five distinct letters.

 So I'll go with RAISE.

 However, let me check: RAISE is a valid English word? Yes, meaning ""to lift up"".

 Therefore, my first guess: ""RAISE""

 We'll get the feedback and then use that to narrow down the next guess.

 So I'll output: <guess>RAISE</guess>

I am starting the game with no prior information, so I need a strategic first guess to maximize feedback. The ideal starting word in Wordle should contain common letters and a balanced mix of vowels/consonants to reveal information about the secret word. After considering common starters like CRANE, SLATE, and RAISE:

- **RAISE** stands out because it covers five distinct high-frequency letters: **R**, **A**, **I**, **S**, and **E**. 
- These letters cover multiple vowels (A, E, I) and common consonants (R, S), increasing the likelihood of hits.
- It avoids rare letters (e.g., J, Q, Z) and minimizes overlap, ensuring efficient information gain from feedback.

This guess will provide clear clues about correct positions (✓), mispositions (-), or exclusions (x), setting up strong deductions for subsequent guesses.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: present but wrong position (so R is in the word, but not at the start)
- A: not in the word
- I: correct position (so I is the third letter of the secret word)
- S: not in the word
- E: not in the word

So we know:
- The secret word has the letter R, but not as the first letter.
- The secret word has the letter I as the third letter.
- The letters A, S, and E are not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: _ _ I _ _

And it contains R (but not in position 1) and does not contain A, S, E.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Has I as the third letter (to keep that fixed, but we already know it's correct so we can use it to test other letters).
- Avoids the letters A, S, E.
- Includes other common letters to test, and also tries to place R in a different position (since we know it's not in position 1).

Possible positions for R: it can be in position 2, 4, or 5 (since position 1 is ruled out and position 3 is I).

We also want to test other common consonants and vowels. Since A and E are out, the remaining vowels are O, U (and sometimes Y, but less common). We should also test common consonants like T, N, L, C, D, M, etc.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern _ _ I _ _ and include R (but not in position 1) and avoid A, S, E.

We can try to put R in position 2, 4, or 5.

Example words:
- If we put R in position 2: then the word is _ R I _ _
  - Possible words: TRIP, FRIT, GRIP, etc. But we need 5 letters, so TRIP is 4. We need 5-letter words.
  - 5-letter words: BRICK, PRICK, TRICK, etc. But note: we cannot use S, E, A. So BRICK? But BRICK has B, R, I, C, K. 
    - However, we don't know about B, C, K yet.

But note: we are not constrained to having R in position 2 only. We can try a word that has R in a different position to test.

We should also consider that we have only 5 tries left, so we want to maximize information.

Let me list some candidate words that have I in the third position and avoid A, S, E.

Common letters to test: T, N, L, O, C, D, M, P, etc.

We can try a word that has T, O, and R, for example.

One candidate: POINT? But POINT has P, O, I, N, T. But note: we don't know if O, N, T are in the word. Also, we haven't tested R in this word. So we should include R.

Another candidate: ROIL? But that's 4 letters. We need 5.

Let me think of words with I in the middle and R somewhere.

Possible words:
- THIRD: T H I R D -> positions: T(1), H(2), I(3), R(4), D(5). This avoids A, S, E and has R in position 4.
  - This would test T, H, R, D and we already know I is fixed.

But H is not the most common. Alternatively, we can try a word with more common letters.

Another word: PRICE -> P R I C E. But E is not allowed (we know E is not in the word). So we cannot use PRICE.

How about: BRING -> B R I N G. But G is not tested. And we avoid A, S, E, so that's okay.

But note: we know E is not in the word, so BRING is acceptable? Yes, because it has B, R, I, N, G. No A, S, E.

But we also want to test other common letters. BRING has B, R, I, N, G. The letters B, N, G are new.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has O and U (vowels) since we haven't tested any vowels except A and E (which are out) and I (which is in). So the secret word might have O or U.

For example: PROUD -> P R O U D. But the third letter is O, not I. We need I in the third position.

We must have I as the third letter.

So: _ _ I _ _

We can try: CHIRP? But that's 5 letters: C H I R P. But again, H and P are not the most common.

Another idea: CHOIR? But that has O and I, but the I is in the fourth position? No, CHOIR is C-H-O-I-R, so I is fourth. We need I as third.

So we need the pattern: ??I??

Let me think of common words that fit: 
- POINT: P-O-I-N-T -> but no R, and we want to test R? We don't have to test R in this guess because we already know R is in the word, but we can test other letters and then use R in a later guess if needed. However, we have 5 tries, so we can test multiple things.

But we know R is in the word, so we should try to find the position of R. So it's better to include R in the next guess to get more information about its position.

So let's try to include R and also test other common letters.

Possible words:
- TRIO: too short.
- TRIP: too short.
- TRIPS: has S, which is not allowed.

We cannot use S.

Another word: BRINK -> B-R-I-N-K. This has B, R, I, N, K. Avoids A, S, E.

Similarly, PRINK: P-R-I-N-K. Same letters except P.

But PRINK is not very common. BRINK is better.

Another option: DRINK -> D-R-I-N-K.

Or: THRID: an old word for third, but not common. We should stick to common words.

Another common word: FRUIT -> F-R-U-I-T. But the I is in the fourth position? F(1), R(2), U(3), I(4), T(5). We need I in the third.

How about: GRIMY -> G-R-I-M-Y. This has G, R, I, M, Y. Avoids A, S, E.

But Y is less common.

Another: PRIMO -> P-R-I-M-O. This has O, which is a vowel we haven't tested.

PRIMO: P(1), R(2), I(3), M(4), O(5). This seems good.

We test P, R, M, O and we know I is fixed.

We also get to see if R is in position 2 (if it's correct, then we know R is second; if not, then R must be in 4 or 5 because we know it's not in 1 and 3 is I).

So let's consider PRIMO.

But is PRIMO common? It means first-rate, but it might be acceptable.

Another word: CRIMP -> C-R-I-M-P. This has C and P.

But we can also consider: BRINY -> B-R-I-N-Y. But Y is less common.

I think PRIMO is a reasonable choice.

But let me think of a word that includes T, which is very common.

For example: TRIPY? Not a word. TRYST? But I is not third.

We need I in third.

How about: ORIEL? O-R-I-E-L -> but E is not allowed. So no.

Another: TORIC -> T-O-R-I-C -> but I is fourth. Not third.

We need the third letter to be I.

So: words like: 
- URBID? Not a word.
- FLUID? F-L-U-I-D -> I is fourth.

It's tricky.

Another common word: CHILD -> C-H-I-L-D. But no R, and we want to test R? We can test R separately, but we have limited guesses.

We know R is in the word, so we should use it.

Let me search for words that have R and I (with I in third) and avoid A, S, E.

Possible words:
- BRIDE -> B-R-I-D-E -> but E is not allowed.
- PRIDE -> P-R-I-D-E -> E not allowed.
- TRICE -> T-R-I-C-E -> E not allowed.

We need to avoid E.

So: 
- BRICK: B-R-I-C-K -> no E, no A, no S. So that's valid.
- PRICK: P-R-I-C-K -> same.
- TRICK: T-R-I-C-K -> same.

These are good because they have T or P or B, and C, K.

Also, they test R in position 2.

If we use TRICK: T(1), R(2), I(3), C(4), K(5)

We can test T, R, C, K and we know I is fixed.

If R is in position 2, then we get a check for R. If not, then we know R must be in 4 or 5 (but in this word, position 4 is C and 5 is K, so if R is not in 2, then we get a '-' for R if it's in 4 or 5? But in this word, there is only one R, so if the secret word has R in position 4, then the R in our guess (position 2) would be marked as '-'? 

But note: the feedback for R: if the secret word has R in position 4, then in our guess TRICK, the R in position 2 would be marked as '-' (because it's present but wrong position) and the C in position 4 would be compared to the secret's position 4. If the secret has R in position 4, then C would be wrong.

So we can get information about R's position.

Similarly, we test T, C, K.

Another candidate: BRINK: B(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), K(5). Tests B, R, N, K.

I think TRICK is a good choice because T is a very common letter.

But note: we are avoiding A, S, E, but T is not ruled out.

So I'll go with TRICK.

But let me confirm: TRICK is a valid 5-letter word, yes.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has O or U to test vowels. Since we haven't tested any vowel except I (and A, E are out), the secret word might have O or U.

For example, PROUD doesn't work because I is not third.

How about: GROIN -> G-R-O-I-N -> I is fourth, not third.

We need I in third.

Another: BROIL -> B-R-O-I-L -> I is fourth.

It's hard to get a word with O and I in third.

What about: OPIUM -> O-P-I-U-M -> O(1), P(2), I(3), U(4), M(5). This avoids A, S, E. And it tests O, P, U, M.

But we are not testing R. We know R is in the word, so if we don't include R, we won't get information about R's position. But we can do that in the next guess.

However, we have 5 tries left, so it's okay to not test R in this guess? But we might waste a guess.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R and O.

For example: CROWD -> C-R-O-W-D -> I is not third.

How about: CROUP -> C-R-O-U-P -> no I.

We need I in third.

So: _ _ I _ _

With R and O: 
- PROXY -> P-R-O-X-Y -> no I.
- FROWN -> F-R-O-W-N -> no I.

It's difficult. 

Another: ROUTE -> has E, not allowed.

So maybe we should not force O and U and instead focus on consonants and test R.

I think TRICK is a solid choice.

But let me see if there's a word that has R and O and I in third.

For example: PRIOR -> P-R-I-O-R -> but this has two R's. And the pattern is P(1), R(2), I(3), O(4), R(5). But we don't know if the secret word has two R's. Also, we avoid A, S, E, so it's okay.

PRIOR: we test P, R, I, O, and R again. But the feedback for the second R: if the secret has only one R, then one of the R's might be marked as '-' and the other as 'x'? It might be messy.

But it's acceptable.

However, TRICK seems simpler.

Another word: CRWTH? Not common and no I.

I think I'll go with TRICK.

So second guess: TRICK

But note: we are not testing O or U, but we can do that in the next guess if needed.

Alternatively, we can use a word like POINT without R? But we know R is in the word, so if we don't include R, we don't get info on R's position. But we can still use POINT to test P, O, N, T.

But then we have to guess R in a later guess.

Given that we have 5 guesses left, it's acceptable, but including R might be more efficient.

I think TRICK is a good choice.

So I'll go with TRICK.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- **R** is in the word but not in position 1 (marked `-`).
- **A** is not in the word (marked `x`).
- **I** is in the word and in the correct position (marked `✓`, so it must be the 3rd letter).
- **S** and **E** are not in the word (both marked `x`).

### Key Deductions:
1. The secret word has the pattern: `_ _ I _ _` (with `I` fixed as the 3rd letter).
2. The word contains **R**, but not in position 1 (so it must be in position 2, 4, or 5).
3. The word **excludes** A, S, and E.
4. We need to test new common letters (e.g., T, O, N, C, L) while probing the position of R.

### Strategy for the Second Guess:
- Choose a word that:
  - Keeps `I` in the 3rd position to maintain the known correct letter.
  - Includes **R** in a new position (e.g., position 2) to test its location.
  - Avoids A, S, E.
  - Tests high-frequency consonants (like T, C, K) and potentially vowels (like O, U), though vowels are less critical now given the constraints.
- **TRICK** is an ideal candidate:
  - Pattern: `T R I C K`
  - Tests **R** in position 2 (if correct, we lock its position; if `-`, R is in 4 or 5; if `x`, it would contradict prior feedback, but we know R is present).
  - Introduces new common letters: **T** (position 1), **C** (position 4), **K** (position 5).
  - Avoids A, S, E entirely.

This guess maximizes information by testing R's position and covering three new letters, narrowing down possibilities efficiently.

<guess>TRICK</guess>",TRICK,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: present but wrong position (so R is in the word, but not at the start)
- A: not in the word
- I: correct position (so I is the third letter of the secret word)
- S: not in the word
- E: not in the word

So we know:
- The secret word has the letter R, but not as the first letter.
- The secret word has the letter I as the third letter.
- The letters A, S, and E are not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: _ _ I _ _

And it contains R (but not in position 1) and does not contain A, S, E.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Has I as the third letter (to keep that fixed, but we already know it's correct so we can use it to test other letters).
- Avoids the letters A, S, E.
- Includes other common letters to test, and also tries to place R in a different position (since we know it's not in position 1).

Possible positions for R: it can be in position 2, 4, or 5 (since position 1 is ruled out and position 3 is I).

We also want to test other common consonants and vowels. Since A and E are out, the remaining vowels are O, U (and sometimes Y, but less common). We should also test common consonants like T, N, L, C, D, M, etc.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern _ _ I _ _ and include R (but not in position 1) and avoid A, S, E.

We can try to put R in position 2, 4, or 5.

Example words:
- If we put R in position 2: then the word is _ R I _ _
  - Possible words: TRIP, FRIT, GRIP, etc. But we need 5 letters, so TRIP is 4. We need 5-letter words.
  - 5-letter words: BRICK, PRICK, TRICK, etc. But note: we cannot use S, E, A. So BRICK? But BRICK has B, R, I, C, K. 
    - However, we don't know about B, C, K yet.

But note: we are not constrained to having R in position 2 only. We can try a word that has R in a different position to test.

We should also consider that we have only 5 tries left, so we want to maximize information.

Let me list some candidate words that have I in the third position and avoid A, S, E.

Common letters to test: T, N, L, O, C, D, M, P, etc.

We can try a word that has T, O, and R, for example.

One candidate: POINT? But POINT has P, O, I, N, T. But note: we don't know if O, N, T are in the word. Also, we haven't tested R in this word. So we should include R.

Another candidate: ROIL? But that's 4 letters. We need 5.

Let me think of words with I in the middle and R somewhere.

Possible words:
- THIRD: T H I R D -> positions: T(1), H(2), I(3), R(4), D(5). This avoids A, S, E and has R in position 4.
  - This would test T, H, R, D and we already know I is fixed.

But H is not the most common. Alternatively, we can try a word with more common letters.

Another word: PRICE -> P R I C E. But E is not allowed (we know E is not in the word). So we cannot use PRICE.

How about: BRING -> B R I N G. But G is not tested. And we avoid A, S, E, so that's okay.

But note: we know E is not in the word, so BRING is acceptable? Yes, because it has B, R, I, N, G. No A, S, E.

But we also want to test other common letters. BRING has B, R, I, N, G. The letters B, N, G are new.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has O and U (vowels) since we haven't tested any vowels except A and E (which are out) and I (which is in). So the secret word might have O or U.

For example: PROUD -> P R O U D. But the third letter is O, not I. We need I in the third position.

We must have I as the third letter.

So: _ _ I _ _

We can try: CHIRP? But that's 5 letters: C H I R P. But again, H and P are not the most common.

Another idea: CHOIR? But that has O and I, but the I is in the fourth position? No, CHOIR is C-H-O-I-R, so I is fourth. We need I as third.

So we need the pattern: ??I??

Let me think of common words that fit: 
- POINT: P-O-I-N-T -> but no R, and we want to test R? We don't have to test R in this guess because we already know R is in the word, but we can test other letters and then use R in a later guess if needed. However, we have 5 tries, so we can test multiple things.

But we know R is in the word, so we should try to find the position of R. So it's better to include R in the next guess to get more information about its position.

So let's try to include R and also test other common letters.

Possible words:
- TRIO: too short.
- TRIP: too short.
- TRIPS: has S, which is not allowed.

We cannot use S.

Another word: BRINK -> B-R-I-N-K. This has B, R, I, N, K. Avoids A, S, E.

Similarly, PRINK: P-R-I-N-K. Same letters except P.

But PRINK is not very common. BRINK is better.

Another option: DRINK -> D-R-I-N-K.

Or: THRID: an old word for third, but not common. We should stick to common words.

Another common word: FRUIT -> F-R-U-I-T. But the I is in the fourth position? F(1), R(2), U(3), I(4), T(5). We need I in the third.

How about: GRIMY -> G-R-I-M-Y. This has G, R, I, M, Y. Avoids A, S, E.

But Y is less common.

Another: PRIMO -> P-R-I-M-O. This has O, which is a vowel we haven't tested.

PRIMO: P(1), R(2), I(3), M(4), O(5). This seems good.

We test P, R, M, O and we know I is fixed.

We also get to see if R is in position 2 (if it's correct, then we know R is second; if not, then R must be in 4 or 5 because we know it's not in 1 and 3 is I).

So let's consider PRIMO.

But is PRIMO common? It means first-rate, but it might be acceptable.

Another word: CRIMP -> C-R-I-M-P. This has C and P.

But we can also consider: BRINY -> B-R-I-N-Y. But Y is less common.

I think PRIMO is a reasonable choice.

But let me think of a word that includes T, which is very common.

For example: TRIPY? Not a word. TRYST? But I is not third.

We need I in third.

How about: ORIEL? O-R-I-E-L -> but E is not allowed. So no.

Another: TORIC -> T-O-R-I-C -> but I is fourth. Not third.

We need the third letter to be I.

So: words like: 
- URBID? Not a word.
- FLUID? F-L-U-I-D -> I is fourth.

It's tricky.

Another common word: CHILD -> C-H-I-L-D. But no R, and we want to test R? We can test R separately, but we have limited guesses.

We know R is in the word, so we should use it.

Let me search for words that have R and I (with I in third) and avoid A, S, E.

Possible words:
- BRIDE -> B-R-I-D-E -> but E is not allowed.
- PRIDE -> P-R-I-D-E -> E not allowed.
- TRICE -> T-R-I-C-E -> E not allowed.

We need to avoid E.

So: 
- BRICK: B-R-I-C-K -> no E, no A, no S. So that's valid.
- PRICK: P-R-I-C-K -> same.
- TRICK: T-R-I-C-K -> same.

These are good because they have T or P or B, and C, K.

Also, they test R in position 2.

If we use TRICK: T(1), R(2), I(3), C(4), K(5)

We can test T, R, C, K and we know I is fixed.

If R is in position 2, then we get a check for R. If not, then we know R must be in 4 or 5 (but in this word, position 4 is C and 5 is K, so if R is not in 2, then we get a '-' for R if it's in 4 or 5? But in this word, there is only one R, so if the secret word has R in position 4, then the R in our guess (position 2) would be marked as '-'? 

But note: the feedback for R: if the secret word has R in position 4, then in our guess TRICK, the R in position 2 would be marked as '-' (because it's present but wrong position) and the C in position 4 would be compared to the secret's position 4. If the secret has R in position 4, then C would be wrong.

So we can get information about R's position.

Similarly, we test T, C, K.

Another candidate: BRINK: B(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), K(5). Tests B, R, N, K.

I think TRICK is a good choice because T is a very common letter.

But note: we are avoiding A, S, E, but T is not ruled out.

So I'll go with TRICK.

But let me confirm: TRICK is a valid 5-letter word, yes.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has O or U to test vowels. Since we haven't tested any vowel except I (and A, E are out), the secret word might have O or U.

For example, PROUD doesn't work because I is not third.

How about: GROIN -> G-R-O-I-N -> I is fourth, not third.

We need I in third.

Another: BROIL -> B-R-O-I-L -> I is fourth.

It's hard to get a word with O and I in third.

What about: OPIUM -> O-P-I-U-M -> O(1), P(2), I(3), U(4), M(5). This avoids A, S, E. And it tests O, P, U, M.

But we are not testing R. We know R is in the word, so if we don't include R, we won't get information about R's position. But we can do that in the next guess.

However, we have 5 tries left, so it's okay to not test R in this guess? But we might waste a guess.

But it's acceptable.

However, TRICK seems simpler.

I think I'll go with TRICK.

So second guess: TRICK

But note: we are not testing O or U, but we can do that in the next guess if needed.

Alternatively, we can use a word like POINT without R? But we know R is in the word, so if we don't include R, we don't get info on R's position. But we can still use POINT to test P, O, N, T.

But then we have to guess R in a later guess.

Given that we have 5 guesses left, it's acceptable, but including R might be more efficient.

I think TRICK is a good choice.

So I'll go with TRICK.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- **R** is in the word but not in position 1 (marked `-`).

 Since there is no prior information, we should pick a word that has common letters and a good distribution to maximize information.
 Commonly used starting words in Wordle are words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRATE"", ""ROATE"", etc., because they contain common letters and have a mix of vowels and consonants.

 However, note that the rules we've been given use BRISK as an example. But let's stick to a general strategy.

 One popular choice is ""ROATE"" (which is an accounting term meaning the accumulated earnings of an entity) but it's not the most common.
 Alternatively, ""RAISE"" is a good starter because it has two vowels and three common consonants.

 Another candidate is ""CRANE"". Let me pick ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are all common.

 But note: the example used BRISK and we saw that S and R were in the word. So maybe a word with multiple common letters?

 However, without any feedback, we just need a word that will give us a lot of information.

 I'll choose ""RAISE"" because it has two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (R, S) which are all common.

 Alternatively, let's look at the most common letters in 5-letter English words: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, etc.

 We can choose a word that covers as many of these as possible.

 Another popular starting word is ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E). It has S, L, A, T, E.

 Let me consider that with ""RAISE"": R, A, I, S, E -> covers R, A, I, S, E.

 With ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E -> covers S, L, A, T, E.

 Both are good. I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it doesn't repeat letters and has a good mix.

 However, note that the feedback in the example used BRISK and the first guess was STORM. But that was an example.

 For the sake of this, let me choose ""CRANE"". It was used in the example? Actually, it's a common starter.

 But wait, the example had BRISK and the first guess STORM had S and R, which matched. CRANE has R and A and E which are vowels and R.

 However, let's stick with a word that has high-frequency letters.

 According to many sources, a good starting word is ""CRATE"" for English. But I'll pick ""CRANE"" to get a vowel (A) and E.

 Actually, ""RAISE"" has more common letters? Let me consider:

 Frequency order: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, ...

 RAISE: R, A, I, S, E -> contains E, A, R, I, S -> five of the top ten.

 CRANE: C, R, A, N, E -> contains E, A, R, N, C -> also five of the top ten but includes C and N which are slightly less frequent than I and S.

 I think RAISE is slightly better because I and S are more frequent than N and C.

 But note: the feedback symbols: 
 - We want to avoid repeating letters because that gives less information.

 Both words have five distinct letters.

 So I'll go with RAISE.

 However, let me check: RAISE is a valid English word? Yes, meaning ""to lift up"".

 Therefore, my first guess: ""RAISE""

 We'll get the feedback and then use that to narrow down the next guess.

 So I'll output: <guess>RAISE</guess>I am starting the game with no prior information, so I need a strategic first guess to maximize feedback. The ideal starting word in Wordle should contain common letters and a balanced mix of vowels/consonants to reveal information about the secret word. After considering common starters like CRANE, SLATE, and RAISE:

- **RAISE** stands out because it covers five distinct high-frequency letters: **R**, **A**, **I**, **S**, and **E**. 
- These letters cover multiple vowels (A, E, I) and common consonants (R, S), increasing the likelihood of hits.
- It avoids rare letters (e.g., J, Q, Z) and minimizes overlap, ensuring efficient information gain from feedback.

This guess will provide clear clues about correct positions (✓), mispositions (-), or exclusions (x), setting up strong deductions for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(✓) S(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: present but wrong position (so R is in the word, but not at the start)
- A: not in the word
- I: correct position (so I is the third letter of the secret word)
- S: not in the word
- E: not in the word

So we know:
- The secret word has the letter R, but not as the first letter.
- The secret word has the letter I as the third letter.
- The letters A, S, and E are not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: _ _ I _ _

And it contains R (but not in position 1) and does not contain A, S, E.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Has I as the third letter (to keep that fixed, but we already know it's correct so we can use it to test other letters).
- Avoids the letters A, S, E.
- Includes other common letters to test, and also tries to place R in a different position (since we know it's not in position 1).

Possible positions for R: it can be in position 2, 4, or 5 (since position 1 is ruled out and position 3 is I).

We also want to test other common consonants and vowels. Since A and E are out, the remaining vowels are O, U (and sometimes Y, but less common). We should also test common consonants like T, N, L, C, D, M, etc.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern _ _ I _ _ and include R (but not in position 1) and avoid A, S, E.

We can try to put R in position 2, 4, or 5.

Example words:
- If we put R in position 2: then the word is _ R I _ _
  - Possible words: TRIP, FRIT, GRIP, etc. But we need 5 letters, so TRIP is 4. We need 5-letter words.
  - 5-letter words: BRICK, PRICK, TRICK, etc. But note: we cannot use S, E, A. So BRICK? But BRICK has B, R, I, C, K. 
    - However, we don't know about B, C, K yet.

But note: we are not constrained to having R in position 2 only. We can try a word that has R in a different position to test.

We should also consider that we have only 5 tries left, so we want to maximize information.

Let me list some candidate words that have I in the third position and avoid A, S, E.

Common letters to test: T, N, L, O, C, D, M, P, etc.

We can try a word that has T, O, and R, for example.

One candidate: POINT? But POINT has P, O, I, N, T. But note: we don't know if O, N, T are in the word. Also, we haven't tested R in this word. So we should include R.

Another candidate: ROIL? But that's 4 letters. We need 5.

Let me think of words with I in the middle and R somewhere.

Possible words:
- THIRD: T H I R D -> positions: T(1), H(2), I(3), R(4), D(5). This avoids A, S, E and has R in position 4.
  - This would test T, H, R, D and we already know I is fixed.

But H is not the most common. Alternatively, we can try a word with more common letters.

Another word: PRICE -> P R I C E. But E is not allowed (we know E is not in the word). So we cannot use PRICE.

How about: BRING -> B R I N G. But G is not tested. And we avoid A, S, E, so that's okay.

But note: we know E is not in the word, so BRING is acceptable? Yes, because it has B, R, I, N, G. No A, S, E.

But we also want to test other common letters. BRING has B, R, I, N, G. The letters B, N, G are new.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has O and U (vowels) since we haven't tested any vowels except A and E (which are out) and I (which is in). So the secret word might have O or U.

For example: PROUD -> P R O U D. But the third letter is O, not I. We need I in the third position.

We must have I as the third letter.

So: _ _ I _ _

We can try: CHIRP? But that's 5 letters: C H I R P. But again, H and P are not the most common.

Another idea: CHOIR? But that has O and I, but the I is in the fourth position? No, CHOIR is C-H-O-I-R, so I is fourth. We need I as third.

So we need the pattern: ??I??

Let me think of common words that fit: 
- POINT: P-O-I-N-T -> but no R, and we want to test R? We don't have to test R in this guess because we already know R is in the word, but we can test other letters and then use R in a later guess if needed. However, we have 5 tries, so we can test multiple things.

But we know R is in the word, so we should try to find the position of R. So it's better to include R in the next guess to get more information about its position.

So let's try to include R and also test other common letters.

Possible words:
- TRIO: too short.
- TRIP: too short.
- TRIPS: has S, which is not allowed.

We cannot use S.

Another word: BRINK -> B-R-I-N-K. This has B, R, I, N, K. Avoids A, S, E.

Similarly, PRINK: P-R-I-N-K. Same letters except P.

But PRINK is not very common. BRINK is better.

Another option: DRINK -> D-R-I-N-K.

Or: THRID: an old word for third, but not common. We should stick to common words.

Another common word: FRUIT -> F-R-U-I-T. But the I is in the fourth position? F(1), R(2), U(3), I(4), T(5). We need I in the third.

How about: GRIMY -> G-R-I-M-Y. This has G, R, I, M, Y. Avoids A, S, E.

But Y is less common.

Another: PRIMO -> P-R-I-M-O. This has O, which is a vowel we haven't tested.

PRIMO: P(1), R(2), I(3), M(4), O(5). This seems good.

We test P, R, M, O and we know I is fixed.

We also get to see if R is in position 2 (if it's correct, then we know R is second; if not, then R must be in 4 or 5 because we know it's not in 1 and 3 is I).

So let's consider PRIMO.

But is PRIMO common? It means first-rate, but it might be acceptable.

Another word: CRIMP -> C-R-I-M-P. This has C and P.

But we can also consider: BRINY -> B-R-I-N-Y. But Y is less common.

I think PRIMO is a reasonable choice.

But let me think of a word that includes T, which is very common.

For example: TRIPY? Not a word. TRYST? But I is not third.

We need I in third.

How about: ORIEL? O-R-I-E-L -> but E is not allowed. So no.

Another: TORIC -> T-O-R-I-C -> but I is fourth. Not third.

We need the third letter to be I.

So: words like: 
- URBID? Not a word.
- FLUID? F-L-U-I-D -> I is fourth.

It's tricky.

Another common word: CHILD -> C-H-I-L-D. But no R, and we want to test R? We can test R separately, but we have limited guesses.

We know R is in the word, so we should use it.

Let me search for words that have R and I (with I in third) and avoid A, S, E.

Possible words:
- BRIDE -> B-R-I-D-E -> but E is not allowed.
- PRIDE -> P-R-I-D-E -> E not allowed.
- TRICE -> T-R-I-C-E -> E not allowed.

We need to avoid E.

So: 
- BRICK: B-R-I-C-K -> no E, no A, no S. So that's valid.
- PRICK: P-R-I-C-K -> same.
- TRICK: T-R-I-C-K -> same.

These are good because they have T or P or B, and C, K.

Also, they test R in position 2.

If we use TRICK: T(1), R(2), I(3), C(4), K(5)

We can test T, R, C, K and we know I is fixed.

If R is in position 2, then we get a check for R. If not, then we know R must be in 4 or 5 (but in this word, position 4 is C and 5 is K, so if R is not in 2, then we get a '-' for R if it's in 4 or 5? But in this word, there is only one R, so if the secret word has R in position 4, then the R in our guess (position 2) would be marked as '-'? 

But note: the feedback for R: if the secret word has R in position 4, then in our guess TRICK, the R in position 2 would be marked as '-' (because it's present but wrong position) and the C in position 4 would be compared to the secret's position 4. If the secret has R in position 4, then C would be wrong.

So we can get information about R's position.

Similarly, we test T, C, K.

Another candidate: BRINK: B(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), K(5). Tests B, R, N, K.

I think TRICK is a good choice because T is a very common letter.

But note: we are avoiding A, S, E, but T is not ruled out.

So I'll go with TRICK.

But let me confirm: TRICK is a valid 5-letter word, yes.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has O or U to test vowels. Since we haven't tested any vowel except I (and A, E are out), the secret word might have O or U.

For example, PROUD doesn't work because I is not third.

How about: GROIN -> G-R-O-I-N -> I is fourth, not third.

We need I in third.

Another: BROIL -> B-R-O-I-L -> I is fourth.

It's hard to get a word with O and I in third.

What about: OPIUM -> O-P-I-U-M -> O(1), P(2), I(3), U(4), M(5). This avoids A, S, E. And it tests O, P, U, M.

But we are not testing R. We know R is in the word, so if we don't include R, we won't get information about R's position. But we can do that in the next guess.

However, we have 5 tries left, so it's okay to not test R in this guess? But we might waste a guess.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R and O.

For example: CROWD -> C-R-O-W-D -> I is not third.

How about: CROUP -> C-R-O-U-P -> no I.

We need I in third.

So: _ _ I _ _

With R and O: 
- PROXY -> P-R-O-X-Y -> no I.
- FROWN -> F-R-O-W-N -> no I.

It's difficult. 

Another: ROUTE -> has E, not allowed.

So maybe we should not force O and U and instead focus on consonants and test R.

I think TRICK is a solid choice.

But let me see if there's a word that has R and O and I in third.

For example: PRIOR -> P-R-I-O-R -> but this has two R's. And the pattern is P(1), R(2), I(3), O(4), R(5). But we don't know if the secret word has two R's. Also, we avoid A, S, E, so it's okay.

PRIOR: we test P, R, I, O, and R again. But the feedback for the second R: if the secret has only one R, then one of the R's might be marked as '-' and the other as 'x'? It might be messy.

But it's acceptable.

However, TRICK seems simpler.

Another word: CRWTH? Not common and no I.

I think I'll go with TRICK.

So second guess: TRICK

But note: we are not testing O or U, but we can do that in the next guess if needed.

Alternatively, we can use a word like POINT without R? But we know R is in the word, so if we don't include R, we don't get info on R's position. But we can still use POINT to test P, O, N, T.

But then we have to guess R in a later guess.

Given that we have 5 guesses left, it's acceptable, but including R might be more efficient.

I think TRICK is a good choice.

So I'll go with TRICK.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- **R** is in the word but not in position 1 (marked `-`).
- **A** is not in the word (marked `x`).
- **I** is in the word and in the correct position (marked `✓`, so it must be the 3rd letter).
- **S** and **E** are not in the word (both marked `x`).

### Key Deductions:
1. The secret word has the pattern: `_ _ I _ _` (with `I` fixed as the 3rd letter).
2. The word contains **R**, but not in position 1 (so it must be in position 2, 4, or 5).
3. The word **excludes** A, S, and E.
4. We need to test new common letters (e.g., T, O, N, C, L) while probing the position of R.

### Strategy for the Second Guess:
- Choose a word that:
  - Keeps `I` in the 3rd position to maintain the known correct letter.
  - Includes **R** in a new position (e.g., position 2) to test its location.
  - Avoids A, S, E.
  - Tests high-frequency consonants (like T, C, K) and potentially vowels (like O, U), though vowels are less critical now given the constraints.
- **TRICK** is an ideal candidate:
  - Pattern: `T R I C K`
  - Tests **R** in position 2 (if correct, we lock its position; if `-`, R is in 4 or 5; if `x`, it would contradict prior feedback, but we know R is present).
  - Introduces new common letters: **T** (position 1), **C** (position 4), **K** (position 5).
  - Avoids A, S, E entirely.

This guess maximizes information by testing R's position and covering three new letters, narrowing down possibilities efficiently.

We need to make the first guess.\n Since there is no prior information, we should pick a word that has common letters and a good distribution to maximize information.\n Commonly used starting words in Wordle are words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRATE"", ""ROATE"", etc., because they contain common letters and have a mix of vowels and consonants.\n\n However, note that the rules we\'ve been given use BRISK as an example.

Not common and no I.\n\nI think I\'ll go with TRICK.\n\nSo second guess: TRICK\n\nBut note: we are not testing O or U, but we can do that in the next guess if needed.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word like POINT without R? But we know R is in the word, so if we don\'t include R, we don\'t get info on R\'s position. But we can still use POINT to test P, O, N, T.\n\nBut then we have to guess R in a later guess.\n\nGiven that we have 5 guesses left, it\'s acceptable, but including R might be more efficient.\n\nI think TRICK is a good choice.\n\nSo I\'ll go with TRICK.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- **R** is in the word but not in position 1 (marked `-`).\n- **A** is not in the word (marked `x`).\n- **I** is in the word and in the correct position (marked `✓`, so it must be the 3rd letter).\n- **S** and **E** are not in the word (both marked `x`).\n\n### Key Deductions:\n1. The secret word has the pattern: `_ _ I _ _` (with `I` fixed as the 3rd letter).\n2. The word contains **R**, but not in position 1 (so it must be in position 2, 4, or 5).\n3. The word **excludes** A, S, and E.\n4. We need to test new common letters (e.g., T, O, N, C, L) while probing the position of R.\n\n### Strategy for the Second Guess:\n- Choose a word that:\n  - Keeps `I` in the 3rd position to maintain the known correct letter.\n  - Includes **R** in a new position (e.g., position 2) to test its location.\n  - Avoids A, S, E.\n  - Tests high-frequency consonants (like T, C, K) and potentially vowels (like O, U), though vowels are less critical now given the constraints.\n- **TRICK** is an ideal candidate:\n  - Pattern: `T R I C K`\n  - Tests **R** in position 2 (if correct, we lock its position; if `-`, R is in 4 or 5; if `x`, it would contradict prior feedback, but we know R is present).\n  - Introduces new common letters: **T** (position 1), **C** (position 4), **K** (position 5).\n  - Avoids A, S, E entirely.\n\nThis guess maximizes information by testing R\'s position and covering three new letters, narrowing down possibilities efficiently.\n\n<guess>TRICK</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(✓) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: TRICK -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) R(-) I(✓) C(x) K(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for two guesses:

First guess: RAISE
- R: present but wrong position (so R is in the word, but not at position 1)
- A: not in the word
- I: correct at position 3
- S: not in the word
- E: not in the word

Second guess: TRICK
- T: correct at position 1 (so the first letter is T)
- R: present but wrong position (so R is in the word, but not at position 2)
- I: correct at position 3 (as before)
- C: not in the word
- K: not in the word

So from the feedback, we know:

1. The first letter is T. (from T(✓) in TRICK)
2. The third letter is I. (from I(✓) in both)
3. The letter R is in the word, but it is not in position 1 (from RAISE) and not in position 2 (from TRICK). Since the word is 5 letters, R must be in position 4 or 5.
4. The letters A, S, E, C, K are not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: T _ I _ _

And the R must be in the fourth or fifth position.

Also, we know the word does not contain: A, S, E, C, K.

We need to make a third guess. We should choose a word that:
- Starts with T (since we know it's correct)
- Has I as the third letter (to keep that fixed)
- Includes R in either the fourth or fifth position to test which one it is (or both to see if it's present, but we know it is, so we want to pin the position)
- Avoids the letters A, S, E, C, K.

Additionally, we should test other common letters that haven't been used yet to get more information.

Letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we should focus on common ones).

We know the word is T _ I _ _

And R is in position 4 or 5.

So let's consider the two cases:

Option 1: R in position 4 -> then the word is T _ I R _
Option 2: R in position 5 -> then the word is T _ I _ R

We can design a guess that tests both possibilities? But we can only put one R. So we have to choose one position to test.

Alternatively, we can put R in one of the positions and test other letters for the remaining spots.

But note: we also have the second position to figure out.

We should choose a word that has R in the fourth position, for example, and then a new letter in the second and fifth, or vice versa.

Let me think of words that start with T, have I in the third, and R in the fourth or fifth.

First, if R is in the fourth: T _ I R _

We need to fill the second and fifth positions with letters that are not A, S, E, C, K, and not R (since we are using one R, and if the word has only one R, then the fifth should be something else).

Similarly, if R is in the fifth: T _ I _ R

We can try to cover both possibilities by using a word that has R in the fifth position and a different letter in the fourth, or vice versa.

But we can only have one R in the guess because we don't know if the word has one or two R's? Actually, we don't have evidence of two R's, so we assume one for now.

So let's try to test R in the fourth position.

For example, a word like: T? I R ?

But we need to choose the second and fifth letters.

We can use common letters: for the second position, try O (a common vowel) and for the fifth, try D (a common consonant). So ""TOIRD""? Not a word.

Another: ""THIRD"" -> T H I R D. This is a valid word.

THIRD: T(1), H(2), I(3), R(4), D(5)

This tests:
- T: already known to be correct, so it will be ✓
- H: new letter, in position 2
- I: known, ✓
- R: in position 4, which we are testing
- D: new letter, in position 5

If the secret word has R in position 4, then R will be ✓. If R is in position 5, then R in position 4 will be marked as '-' (wrong position) and we will know R is in position 5.

Also, we get to test H and D.

But note: if the secret word is THIRD, then we win.

Alternatively, we could test R in the fifth position.

For example: T? I ? R

Word: ""TIGER"" -> but E is not allowed (we know E is not in the word). So invalid.

""TILER"" -> E not allowed.

""TIMER"" -> E not allowed.

""TIPER"" -> not a word and E.

So it's hard to find a word with R in the fifth that avoids E and the other forbidden letters.

Another word: ""TAPIR"" -> but A is not allowed (from RAISE feedback: A(x)).

""TAWIR""? Not a word.

""TOWER"" -> E not allowed.

So perhaps testing R in the fourth position is easier.

Another candidate: ""TRIOR"" -> but that has two R's? T-R-I-O-R. But we don't know if the word has two R's. Also, O is tested.

But let's see: if we use ""THIRD"", it's a common word and avoids the forbidden letters.

We can also consider ""TRIED"" -> but E is not allowed.

So ""THIRD"" seems good.

But what about the second position? We are testing H. H is not the most common, but it's acceptable.

Another word: ""TRIBE"" -> E not allowed.

""TRICE"" -> E not allowed and C is not allowed (from TRICK: C(x)).

""TRINE"" -> E not allowed.

""TRIPE"" -> E not allowed.

So ""THIRD"" is a solid choice.

But note: we haven't tested O, U, L, N, etc. We can test those in the next guess if needed.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests a different set of letters.

For example, if we put R in the fifth position: we need a word like T _ I _ R.

What words fit? 
- ""TONIR""? Not a word.
- ""TAMIR""? A not allowed.
- ""TUMOR"" -> T U M O R -> but the third letter is M, not I.

We need I in the third.

So: T? I ? R

Possible: ""TIGER"", ""TIMER"", etc. but E is out.

""PILAR"" -> doesn't start with T.

I think it's difficult. So let's stick with ""THIRD"".

But wait, what about ""TWIRE""? Not common and might not be valid.

Another idea: ""TRIAL"" -> A not allowed.

So I think ""THIRD"" is the best.

But let me check if there are other words.

What about ""TRIOL"" -> not common.

Or ""TRIER"" -> has E? T-R-I-E-R -> E is in position 4, which is not allowed.

So I'll go with ""THIRD"".

Therefore, our third guess: THIRD

This will help us determine the position of R and test H and D.

If the secret word is THIRD, we win.

If not, we get feedback on H and D and the position of R.

So output: <guess>THIRD</guess>

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
1. **Guess 1: RAISE → Feedback: R(-) A(x) I(✓) S(x) E(x)**  
   - **R** is in the word but not in position 1.  
   - **I** is correct and in position 3.  
   - **A, S, E** are absent.  
   - Secret word pattern: `_ _ I _ _` (I fixed at position 3), with R present (position 2, 4, or 5).  

2. **Guess 2: TRICK → Feedback: T(✓) R(-) I(✓) C(x) K(x)**  
   - **T** is correct and in position 1.  
   - **R** is present but not in position 2 (confirms it must be in position 4 or 5).  
   - **I** is correct and in position 3 (redundant).  
   - **C, K** are absent.  
   - Secret word pattern: **`T _ I _ _`** with R in position 4 or 5.  
   - Absent letters: **A, S, E, C, K**.  

### Key Deductions:
- **Fixed positions**:  
  - Position 1: **T**  
  - Position 3: **I**  
- **R position**: Must be in position 4 or 5 (since ruled out of 1 and 2).  
- **Absent letters**: A, S, E, C, K (cannot appear in the word).  
- **Unknown positions**:  
  - Position 2: Unknown letter (not A, S, E, C, K, R).  
  - Position 4/5: One is R, the other is unknown (not A, S, E, C, K).  

### Strategy for Third Guess:
- **Goal**: Test the position of R (4 or 5) and probe position 2.  
- **Ideal word**:  
  - Starts with **T** (position 1 fixed).  
  - Has **I** in position 3 (fixed).  
  - Places **R** in position 4 (to test if it belongs there; if not, R must be in position 5).  
  - Tests new high-frequency letters for position 2 and 5 (e.g., **H**, **D**).  
  - Avoids absent letters (A, S, E, C, K).  
- **Chosen word: THIRD**  
  - **T** (position 1): Confirms fixed position (will be ✓).  
  - **H** (position 2): Tests a common consonant.  
  - **I** (position 3): Fixed (✓).  
  - **R** (position 4): Tests if R is in position 4 (if ✓, R is confirmed; if -, R must be in position 5).  
  - **D** (position 5): Tests a common consonant.  
- **Why THIRD?**  
  - Efficiently narrows R's position while testing two new letters (H, D).  
  - If R is in position 4, feedback will confirm it. If not, R must be in position 5.  
  - Avoids all excluded letters (A, S, E, C, K).
