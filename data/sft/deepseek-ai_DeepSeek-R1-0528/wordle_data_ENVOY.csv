We are just starting the game. We have no feedback yet. We need a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has a mix of common vowels and consonants. 
 The idea is to cover as many common letters as possible to get informative feedback.
 Popular starting words are often like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""RAISE"", ""ROATE"", etc.

 Considering this, let's choose ""RAISE"". 
 Why ""RAISE""? 
   - It has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).
   - It covers five distinct letters, which maximizes the information.

 So, I'll guess ""RAISE"".

For the first guess, it's essential to choose a word that covers a mix of common vowels and consonants to gather maximum information. The word ""RAISE"" is an excellent starter because it includes three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), all distinct letters. This will help reveal which letters are in the secret word and their positions quickly.

We are on the second guess. The first guess was ""RAISE"" and the feedback was: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
 This means:
   R is not in the secret word.
   A is not in the secret word.
   I is not in the secret word.
   S is not in the secret word.
   E is in the secret word but in the wrong position.

 So, we know:
   The secret word contains the letter E, but not at the last position (since in ""RAISE"", E was at the end and it's wrong position).
   Also, the secret word does not contain R, A, I, S.

 Given that E is present but not at the 5th position, it could be in one of the first four positions.

 Since the first guess eliminated R, A, I, S, we should choose a new word that:
   - Includes E (because we know it's in the word) but not at the end.
   - Uses other common letters that haven't been tried yet (like T, N, O, L, C, D, U, M, etc.), avoiding R, A, I, S.

 Let's think of a word that fits:
   The new word must be 5 letters long, valid, and without R, A, I, S.

 We also note that E is not at the 5th position, so we can place E in positions 1-4.

 Possibilities for E: since it can't be at the end, we might put it at the beginning or in the middle.

 But note: although we know E is in the word, we don't know exactly where. We must try to cover multiple possibilities and include new common letters.

 Example words: 
   Could try ""TENOR"", but note that O and R: but wait, R was already ruled out, so we cannot use R. Similarly, we cannot use A, I, S.

 Revised: avoid R, A, I, S.

 So, let's think of words with E and other common letters. Some options:

   E in position 1: e.g., ""E"", then four more letters without R,A,I,S. Example: ""ELOPE"", but L and O and P. Also, E would be at position 1, which is a new position. But note we have only one E so far? The feedback didn't say anything about multiple E's, so it's possible.

   But we don't know the frequency. However, the feedback shows only one E was marked, so we know at least one E is present. If there were two E's, then the feedback might have shown two minuses? But note: if the word had two E's and one was in the correct position, it would show as correct. Since the E was marked as present but wrong position, that doesn't preclude another E. However, we don't have evidence of a second E yet.

   We should avoid using E twice unless necessary? Since it's the second guess, we can focus on getting more information.

 Another idea: we want to cover more vowels? We know A and I are not present, so the vowels are only E? But possibly other vowels: O or U?

 What are the vowels? A, E, I, O, U. We know A and I are out, so we have O and U as possibilities.

 Let's choose a word that includes E (in a position other than 5), and also includes common consonants like T, N, L, etc., and another vowel (O or U).

 Example words:

   ""TENOR"": contains R -> invalid because R is eliminated. So no.

   ""MELON"": 
        M, E, L, O, N. 
        None of these are R, A, I, S. 
        E is in the second position (not 5th). 
        This word can help test for M, L, O, N and E.

   Other possibilities: ""CLONE"", ""WHOLE"", ""OUNCE"", etc. But let's choose something without letters we know are out.

   Another common word: ""HOUSE"": contains S -> S is eliminated? No, feedback said S(x), so S is not in the secret word. Therefore, we cannot use HOUSE because S is not allowed.

   Similarly, we must avoid R, A, I, S.

   ""MELON"" is okay: M, E, L, O, N.

   ""EDUCU"" is not a word.

   ""OUNCE"": O, U, N, C, E. E is at the end? But we want to avoid putting E at the end because we know E is not at the end? Actually, in the first word, E was at the end and marked as wrong position. That only means that E is present but not at position 5. It doesn't prevent E from being at the end in the next guess? Actually, we are allowed to guess words that have E at the end again, but it wouldn't be efficient because we know for the solution that E isn't at the end. So we can avoid putting E at the end.

   Therefore, in ""OUNCE"", E is at the end -> not ideal.

   ""MODEL"": M-O-D-E-L -> E is at position 4. That avoids the end (which is position 5). But we don't know if position 4 is correct? We just want to test more letters.

   Another word: ""LETUP"" -> but L-E-T-U-P. E is at position 2. But we don't know if we can use L, T, U, P.

   How about ""TOUCH"": but doesn't have E? So we can't test if E is in the word? But we already know E is in the word, so we must include E in this guess to try to pin its position? Actually, we can use a word without E? But that might not be efficient because we need to find the position of E. And we have only 5 more guesses.

   Since we know E is in the word, we should include it to get more positional information.

   So back to words that include E and are without R, A, I, S.

   ""MELON"" seems good: M-E-L-O-N. E is at position 2.

   Other options: ""BOTHE"" -> but that's not common and E is at the end? Avoid end E.

   ""NEEDY"": contains E twice? And D and Y. Also, second E at the end? We can avoid that because we know E is not at the end in the solution.

   Another: ""COMET"": C-O-M-E-T. E at position 4. This avoids the end and uses new letters.

   We might consider: ""COMET"" vs ""MELON"".

   Both introduce new letters. Let's compare:

      MELON: M, E, L, O, N
      COMET: C, O, M, E, T

   They both have E and O. MELON has L and N, COMET has C and T.

   T is one of the most common consonants, so maybe we should include T? Similarly, N is also common.

   Since we have eliminated R, A, I, S, we want to cover other high frequency letters: E is already known, then T, N, O, L are common.

   Both words cover T/N and L/C. Let's see what we have:

      Letters used so far: R, A, I, S, E. We introduced E but failed R,A,I,S.

      So for the next word, we want to test T, N, L, O, etc.

   Word ""COMET"": covers C, O, M, E, T -> we get to test T and M.

   But we already have M in MELON? Actually, we haven't used M yet? First word was RAISE: R,A,I,S,E. So M is untested.

   How about ""DOUTE"": not a word.

   Another: ""TOKEN"": T-O-K-E-N -> K is less common? But valid word. Using K might be a bit less efficient.

   We can try ""COUNT"": but C-O-U-N-T -> no E? So we skip E testing? We should include E.

   Therefore, I think ""COMET"" is a reasonable choice: it has E at position 4 (which is different from position 5) and introduces C, O, M, T.

   But note: O is a vowel, and we haven't tested it.

   Alternatively, ""MOUNT"": not because no E.

   Another option: ""BELOW"": but B-E-L-O-W -> E is at position 2. And letters are B, L, O, W. Avoids R,A,I,S.

   However, let's check if B has been tested? It hasn't.

   But ""BELOW"" uses W which is less common? Maybe we want to test higher frequency letters.

   By frequency: T is more common than W. So COMET might be better? Also, COMET uses T which is common.

   Therefore, I think ""COMET"" is a good choice.

   However, note: in ""COMET"", E is at position 4. We don't know if that's the correct position? We are trying to get feedback on E's position.

   Alternatively, we can try to put E at an entirely new position? For example, position 1? 

   Example: ""EBONY"": E-B-O-N-Y -> E is at position 1, which wasn't tested in the first word (RAISE had E at position 5). So we can test position 1.

   Also, EBONY introduces B, O, N, Y. O and N are common.

   How common? T is more common than B and Y. So might not be optimal.

   Another word with E at the start: ""ENACT"": E-N-A-C-T -> but A is eliminated? A is in the word? Wait, we cannot use A because it's eliminated. So invalid.

   ""EJECT"": not standard and uses J? Not common.

   ""ELOPE"": E-L-O-P-E -> E at both 1 and 5? But that might complicate and is also not efficient? Additionally, we know E isn't at 5. So why put it there? Avoid.

   ""ENTER"": but R is eliminated -> invalid.

   So, putting E at position 1 might be hard without using eliminated letters.

   How about position 3? Example: ""METRO"": but again, R is out -> invalid.

   ""LEMON"": but L-E-M-O-N -> same as MELON but rearranged. Then E is at position 2? Actually, MELON has E at 2. LEMON has E at 2? 

   Actually: 
      LEMON: L at position 1, E at 2, M at 3, O at 4, N at 5.

   But having E at position 2? Then we can test if E is at position 2? 

   We haven't tested position 2 yet: in RAISE, E was at position 5 and got minus. So positions 1,2,3,4 are unknown for E.

   So MELON (or LEMON) has E at 2. COMET has E at 4.

   Both are fine.

   Alternatively, we can also have E at position 3? Like ""DEUCE"" -> not common and U and C.

   After consideration, I think ""COMET"" is acceptable.

   But is ""COMET"" a valid word? Yes.

   However, let's consider including the next most common letters:

   After E, the next common consonants without R, S (which are eliminated) are T, N, L, C, D.

   In COMET: T, C, M, O -> M is common? Not as common as T, N, L.

   So maybe ""TENET"": but T-E-N-E-T? E twice and T twice? Also, E at position 2 and 4? But we know E is only at least one. This might complicate feedback? And it uses E twice, which if the word has only one E, we might get mixed signals? Also, we have only one E so far known.

   Another word: ""NOBLE"": N-O-B-L-E -> but E at the end? We avoid because we don't want to put E at the end.

   ""CEMENT"": not 5 letters.

   So perhaps the best is either MELON or COMET? 

   Let me look for a word that includes E in the middle and common letters T, N, O, etc.

   How about ""TONNE""? Not common? And has N twice? And E at the end? Avoid.

   ""LENTO"": L-E-N-T-O -> E at position 2. Uses L, N, T, O.

   That seems good: L, N, T are common consonants.

   So LENTO: 
        position1: L
        position2: E
        position3: N
        position4: T
        position5: O

   We avoid R, A, I, S? Yes: L, E, N, T, O.

   And E is at position 2, which we haven't tested.

   And we cover L, E, N, T, O. Even though E is known, we get to test its position.

   L, N, T are very common and we haven't tested them.

   So ""LENTO"" might be better? Because it covers T, N, L which are high frequency.

   Compare:

      COMET: C, O, M, E, T -> we cover T, O, M, E, C.

      LENTO: L, E, N, T, O -> we cover L, E, N, T, O.

   The letters L, N, T are more common than C, O, M? 

   Frequency in English for 5-letter words: 
      E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... 
      Since A, I, S are eliminated, then T, O, N are high.

      Then L is also common.

      M and C are less common than T, N, L? 

      Actually, T is very common (most common after E), so having T is good.

      Both have T and O? 

      In terms of information gain: LENTO introduces 4 new common letters: L, N, T, O? Wait, O is new? And E we know.

      Whereas COMET introduces T, O, M, C? 

      The letters we have not used: 
        Used: R, A, I, S, E (from first guess)
        New: if we use LENTO, we use L, N, T, O and E.
        So new letters: L, N, T, O.

        With COMET: new letters: C, O, M, T.

      Now, comparing frequency (approximate):

        T: very high (about 9% in 5-letter words)
        N: high (about 6%)
        L: high (about 4%)
        O: about 7%
        C: about 3%
        M: about 3%

      So T, N, O, L are more frequent than C, M.

      Therefore, LENTO seems better because it tests higher frequency letters.

   So I choose ""LENTO"".

   But note: O is a vowel. We have tested O? Not yet.

   Also, the word ""LENTO"" is valid? Yes.

   Therefore, our next guess: LENTO.

   We expect to get feedback on:
        L at position1
        E at position2 -> we know E is in the word, so we hope to find if it is at position2 or not? 
        N at position3
        T at position4
        O at position5

   This will give information about E's position as well.

   Let me confirm: 
     The secret word has E? Yes, but we don't know where. Also, O might be present? We don't know.

   We are prioritizing testing high frequency letters.

   So, I'll go with ""LENTO"".

   But wait, what if the secret word has double letters? Not likely? We don't have evidence of that.

   Therefore, the next guess is ""LENTO"".
</think>
After evaluating the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"" where R, A, I, and S were absent (x) and E was present but misplaced (-), the strategy is to test high-frequency letters not yet tried while avoiding R, A, I, and S. The word must include E but not in the 5th position (since it was misplaced there in ""RAISE""). 

The chosen word ""LENTO"" introduces:
- **L, N, T, O**: High-frequency letters not previously tested.
- **E at position 2**: Tests a new position (positions 1-4 are unknown for E).
- Avoids eliminated letters (R, A, I, S).

This maximizes information gain:
- Tests E’s possible location.
- Covers common consonants (T, N, L) and vowel (O).
- Provides feedback that adjusts the search space effectively.

<guess>lento</guess>",lento,"We are on the second guess. The first guess was ""RAISE"" and the feedback was: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
 This means:
   R is not in the secret word.
   A is not in the secret word.
   I is not in the secret word.
   S is not in the secret word.
   E is in the secret word but in the wrong position.

 So, we know:
   The secret word contains the letter E, but not at the last position (since in ""RAISE"", E was at the end and it's wrong position).
   Also, the secret word does not contain R, A, I, S.

 Given that E is present but not at the 5th position, it could be in one of the first four positions.

 Since the first guess eliminated R, A, I, S, we should choose a new word that:
   - Includes E (because we know it's in the word) but not at the end.
   - Uses other common letters that haven't been tried yet (like T, N, O, L, C, D, U, M, etc.), avoiding R, A, I, S.

 Let's think of a word that fits:
   The new word must be 5 letters long, valid, and without R, A, I, S.

 We also note that E is not at the 5th position, so we can place E in positions 1-4.

 Possibilities for E: since it can't be at the end, we might put it at the beginning or in the middle.

 But note: although we know E is in the word, we don't know exactly where. We must try to cover multiple possibilities and include new common letters.

 Example words: 
   Could try ""TENOR"", but note that O and R: but wait, R was already ruled out, so we cannot use R. Similarly, we cannot use A, I, S.

 Revised: avoid R, A, I, S.

 So, let's think of words with E and other common letters. Some options:

   E in position 1: e.g., ""E"", then four more letters without R,A,I,S. Example: ""ELOPE"", but L and O and P. Also, E would be at position 1, which is a new position. But note we have only one E so far? The feedback didn't say anything about multiple E's, so it's possible.

   But we don't know the frequency. However, the feedback shows only one E was marked, so we know at least one E is present. If there were two E's, then the feedback might have shown two minuses? But note: if the word had two E's and one was in the correct position, it would show as correct. Since the E was marked as present but wrong position, that doesn't preclude another E. However, we don't have evidence of a second E yet.

   We should avoid using E twice unless necessary? Since it's the second guess, we can focus on getting more information.

 Another idea: we want to cover more vowels? We know A and I are not present, so the vowels are only E? But possibly other vowels: O or U?

 What are the vowels? A, E, I, O, U. We know A and I are out, so we have O and U as possibilities.

 Let's choose a word that includes E (in a position other than 5), and also includes common consonants like T, N, L, etc., and another vowel (O or U).

 Example words:

   ""TENOR"": contains R -> invalid because R is eliminated. So no.

   ""MELON"": 
        M, E, L, O, N. 
        None of these are R, A, I, S. 
        E is in the second position (not 5th). 
        This word can help test for M, L, O, N and E.

   Other possibilities: ""CLONE"", ""WHOLE"", ""OUNCE"", etc. But let's choose something without letters we know are out.

   Another common word: ""HOUSE"": contains S -> S is eliminated? No, feedback said S(x), so S is not in the secret word. Therefore, we cannot use HOUSE because S is not allowed.

   Similarly, we must avoid R, A, I, S.

   ""MELON"" is okay: M, E, L, O, N.

   ""EDUCU"" is not a word.

   ""OUNCE"": O, U, N, C, E. E is at the end? But we want to avoid putting E at the end because we know E is not at the end? Actually, in the first word, E was at the end and marked as wrong position. That only means that E is present but not at position 5. It doesn't prevent E from being at the end in the next guess? Actually, we are allowed to guess words that have E at the end again, but it wouldn't be efficient because we know for the solution that E isn't at the end. So we can avoid putting E at the end.

   Therefore, in ""OUNCE"", E is at the end -> not ideal.

   ""MODEL"": M-O-D-E-L -> E is at position 4. That avoids the end (which is position 5). But we don't know if position 4 is correct? We just want to test more letters.

   Another word: ""LETUP"" -> but L-E-T-U-P. E is at position 2. But we don't know if we can use L, T, U, P.

   How about ""TOUCH"": but doesn't have E? So we can't test if E is in the word? But we already know E is in the word, so we must include E in this guess to try to pin its position? Actually, we can use a word without E? But that might not be efficient because we need to find the position of E. And we have only 5 more guesses.

   Since we know E is in the word, we should include it to get more positional information.

   So back to words that include E and are without R, A, I, S.

   ""MELON"" seems good: M-E-L-O-N. E is at position 2.

   Other options: ""BOTHE"" -> but that's not common and E is at the end? Avoid end E.

   ""NEEDY"": contains E twice? And D and Y. Also, second E at the end? We can avoid that because we know E is not at the end in the solution.

   Another: ""COMET"": C-O-M-E-T. E at position 4. This avoids the end and uses new letters.

   We might consider: ""COMET"" vs ""MELON"".

   Both introduce new letters. Let's compare:

      MELON: M, E, L, O, N
      COMET: C, O, M, E, T

   They both have E and O. MELON has L and N, COMET has C and T.

   T is one of the most common consonants, so maybe we should include T? Similarly, N is also common.

   Since we have eliminated R, A, I, S, we want to cover other high frequency letters: E is already known, then T, N, O, L are common.

   Both words cover T/N and L/C. Let's see what we have:

      Letters used so far: R, A, I, S, E. We introduced E but failed R,A,I,S.

      So for the next word, we want to test T, N, L, O, etc.

   Word ""COMET"": covers C, O, M, E, T -> we get to test T and M.

   But we already have M in MELON? Actually, we haven't used M yet? First word was RAISE: R,A,I,S,E. So M is untested.

   How about ""DOUTE"": not a word.

   Another: ""TOKEN"": T-O-K-E-N -> K is less common? But valid word. Using K might be a bit less efficient.

   We can try ""COUNT"": but C-O-U-N-T -> no E? So we skip E testing? We should include E.

   Therefore, I think ""COMET"" is a reasonable choice: it has E at position 4 (which is different from position 5) and introduces C, O, M, T.

   But note: O is a vowel, and we haven't tested it.

   Alternatively, ""MOUNT"": not because no E.

   Another option: ""BELOW"": but B-E-L-O-W -> E is at position 2. And letters are B, L, O, W. Avoids R,A,I,S.

   However, let's check if B has been tested? It hasn't.

   But ""BELOW"" uses W which is less common? Maybe we want to test higher frequency letters.

   By frequency: T is more common than W. So COMET might be better? Also, COMET uses T which is common.

   Therefore, I think ""COMET"" is a good choice.

   However, note: in ""COMET"", E is at position 4. We don't know if that's the correct position? We are trying to get feedback on E's position.

   Alternatively, we can try to put E at an entirely new position? For example, position 1? 

   Example: ""EBONY"": E-B-O-N-Y -> E is at position 1, which wasn't tested in the first word (RAISE had E at position 5). So we can test position 1.

   Also, EBONY introduces B, O, N, Y. O and N are common.

   How common? T is more common than B and Y. So might not be optimal.

   Another word with E at the start: ""ENACT"": E-N-A-C-T -> but A is eliminated? A is in the word? Wait, we cannot use A because it's eliminated. So invalid.

   ""EJECT"": not standard and uses J? Not common.

   ""ELOPE"": E-L-O-P-E -> E at both 1 and 5? But that might complicate and is also not efficient? Additionally, we know E isn't at 5. So why put it there? Avoid.

   ""ENTER"": but R is eliminated -> invalid.

   So, putting E at position 1 might be hard without using eliminated letters.

   How about position 3? Example: ""METRO"": but again, R is out -> invalid.

   ""LEMON"": but L-E-M-O-N -> same as MELON but rearranged. Then E is at position 2? Actually, MELON has E at 2. LEMON has E at 2? 

   Actually: 
      LEMON: L at position 1, E at 2, M at 3, O at 4, N at 5.

   But having E at position 2? Then we can test if E is at position 2? 

   We haven't tested position 2 yet: in RAISE, E was at position 5 and got minus. So positions 1,2,3,4 are unknown for E.

   So MELON (or LEMON) has E at 2. COMET has E at 4.

   Both are fine.

   Alternatively, we can also have E at position 3? Like ""DEUCE"" -> not common and U and C.

   After consideration, I think ""COMET"" is acceptable.

   But is ""COMET"" a valid word? Yes.

   However, let's consider including the next most common letters:

   After E, the next common consonants without R, S (which are eliminated) are T, N, L, C, D.

   In COMET: T, C, M, O -> M is common? Not as common as T, N, L.

   So maybe ""TENET"": but T-E-N-E-T? E twice and T twice? Also, E at position 2 and 4? But we know E is only at least one. This might complicate feedback? And it uses E twice, which if the word has only one E, we might get mixed signals? Also, we have only one E so far known.

   Another word: ""NOBLE"": N-O-B-L-E -> but E at the end? We avoid because we don't want to put E at the end.

   ""CEMENT"": not 5 letters.

   So perhaps the best is either MELON or COMET? 

   Let me look for a word that includes E in the middle and common letters T, N, O, etc.

   How about ""TONNE""? Not common? And has N twice? And E at the end? Avoid.

   ""LENTO"": L-E-N-T-O -> E at position 2. Uses L, N, T, O.

   That seems good: L, N, T are common consonants.

   So LENTO: 
        position1: L
        position2: E
        position3: N
        position4: T
        position5: O

   We avoid R, A, I, S? Yes: L, E, N, T, O.

   And E is at position 2, which we haven't tested.

   And we cover L, E, N, T, O. Even though E is known, we get to test its position.

   L, N, T are very common and we haven't tested them.

   So ""LENTO"" might be better? Because it covers T, N, L which are high frequency.

   Compare:

      COMET: C, O, M, E, T -> we cover T, O, M, E, C.

      LENTO: L, E, N, T, O -> we cover L, E, N, T, O.

   The letters L, N, T are more common than C, O, M? 

   Frequency in English for 5-letter words: 
      E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... 
      Since A, I, S are eliminated, then T, O, N are high.

      Then L is also common.

      M and C are less common than T, N, L? 

      Actually, T is very common (most common after E), so having T is good.

      Both have T and O? 

      In terms of information gain: LENTO introduces 4 new common letters: L, N, T, O? Wait, O is new? And E we know.

      Whereas COMET introduces T, O, M, C? 

      The letters we have not used: 
        Used: R, A, I, S, E (from first guess)
        New: if we use LENTO, we use L, N, T, O and E.
        So new letters: L, N, T, O.

        With COMET: new letters: C, O, M, T.

      Now, comparing frequency (approximate):

        T: very high (about 9% in 5-letter words)
        N: high (about 6%)
        L: high (about 4%)
        O: about 7%
        C: about 3%
        M: about 3%

      So T, N, O, L are more frequent than C, M.

      Therefore, LENTO seems better because it tests higher frequency letters.

   So I choose ""LENTO"".

   But note: O is a vowel. We have tested O? Not yet.

   Also, the word ""LENTO"" is valid? Yes.

   Therefore, our next guess: LENTO.

   We expect to get feedback on:
        L at position1
        E at position2 -> we know E is in the word, so we hope to find if it is at position2 or not? 
        N at position3
        T at position4
        O at position5

   This will give information about E's position as well.

   Let me confirm: 
     The secret word has E? Yes, but we don't know where. Also, O might be present? We don't know.

   We are prioritizing testing high frequency letters.

   So, I'll go with ""LENTO"".

   But wait, what if the secret word has double letters? Not likely? We don't have evidence of that.

   Therefore, the next guess is ""LENTO"".After evaluating the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"" where R, A, I, and S were absent (x) and E was present but misplaced (-), the strategy is to test high-frequency letters not yet tried while avoiding R, A, I, and S. The word must include E but not in the 5th position (since it was misplaced there in ""RAISE""). 

The chosen word ""LENTO"" introduces:
- **L, N, T, O**: High-frequency letters not previously tested.
- **E at position 2**: Tests a new position (positions 1-4 are unknown for E).
- Avoids eliminated letters (R, A, I, S).

This maximizes information gain:
- Tests E’s possible location.
- Covers common consonants (T, N, L) and vowel (O).
- Provides feedback that adjusts the search space effectively.",Guess 2: lento -> FEEDBACK: L(x) E(-) N(-) T(x) O(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,ENVOY,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are just starting the game. We have no feedback yet. We need a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has a mix of common vowels and consonants. 
 The idea is to cover as many common letters as possible to get informative feedback.
 Popular starting words are often like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""RAISE"", ""ROATE"", etc.

 Considering this, let's choose ""RAISE"". 
 Why ""RAISE""? 
   - It has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).
   - It covers five distinct letters, which maximizes the information.

 So, I'll guess ""RAISE"".For the first guess, it's essential to choose a word that covers a mix of common vowels and consonants to gather maximum information. The word ""RAISE"" is an excellent starter because it includes three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), all distinct letters. This will help reveal which letters are in the secret word and their positions quickly.

<guess>raise</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are on the second guess. The first guess was ""RAISE"" and the feedback was: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
 This means:
   R is not in the secret word.
   A is not in the secret word.
   I is not in the secret word.
   S is not in the secret word.
   E is in the secret word but in the wrong position.

 So, we know:
   The secret word contains the letter E, but not at the last position (since in ""RAISE"", E was at the end and it's wrong position).
   Also, the secret word does not contain R, A, I, S.

 Given that E is present but not at the 5th position, it could be in one of the first four positions.

 Since the first guess eliminated R, A, I, S, we should choose a new word that:
   - Includes E (because we know it's in the word) but not at the end.
   - Uses other common letters that haven't been tried yet (like T, N, O, L, C, D, U, M, etc.), avoiding R, A, I, S.

 Let's think of a word that fits:
   The new word must be 5 letters long, valid, and without R, A, I, S.

 We also note that E is not at the 5th position, so we can place E in positions 1-4.

 Possibilities for E: since it can't be at the end, we might put it at the beginning or in the middle.

 But note: although we know E is in the word, we don't know exactly where. We must try to cover multiple possibilities and include new common letters.

 Example words: 
   Could try ""TENOR"", but note that O and R: but wait, R was already ruled out, so we cannot use R. Similarly, we cannot use A, I, S.

 Revised: avoid R, A, I, S.

 So, let's think of words with E and other common letters. Some options:

   E in position 1: e.g., ""E"", then four more letters without R,A,I,S. Example: ""ELOPE"", but L and O and P. Also, E would be at position 1, which is a new position. But note we have only one E so far? The feedback didn't say anything about multiple E's, so it's possible.

   But we don't know the frequency. However, the feedback shows only one E was marked, so we know at least one E is present. If there were two E's, then the feedback might have shown two minuses? But note: if the word had two E's and one was in the correct position, it would show as correct. Since the E was marked as present but wrong position, that doesn't preclude another E. However, we don't have evidence of a second E yet.

   We should avoid using E twice unless necessary? Since it's the second guess, we can focus on getting more information.

 Another idea: we want to cover more vowels? We know A and I are not present, so the vowels are only E? But possibly other vowels: O or U?

 What are the vowels? A, E, I, O, U. We know A and I are out, so we have O and U as possibilities.

 Let's choose a word that includes E (in a position other than 5), and also includes common consonants like T, N, L, etc., and another vowel (O or U).

 Example words:

   ""TENOR"": contains R -> invalid because R is eliminated. So no.

   ""MELON"": 
        M, E, L, O, N. 
        None of these are R, A, I, S. 
        E is in the second position (not 5th). 
        This word can help test for M, L, O, N and E.

   Other possibilities: ""CLONE"", ""WHOLE"", ""OUNCE"", etc. But let's choose something without letters we know are out.

   Another common word: ""HOUSE"": contains S -> S is eliminated? No, feedback said S(x), so S is not in the secret word. Therefore, we cannot use HOUSE because S is not allowed.

   Similarly, we must avoid R, A, I, S.

   ""MELON"" is okay: M, E, L, O, N.

   ""EDUCU"" is not a word.

   ""OUNCE"": O, U, N, C, E. E is at the end? But we want to avoid putting E at the end because we know E is not at the end? Actually, in the first word, E was at the end and marked as wrong position. That only means that E is present but not at position 5. It doesn't prevent E from being at the end in the next guess? Actually, we are allowed to guess words that have E at the end again, but it wouldn't be efficient because we know for the solution that E isn't at the end. So we can avoid putting E at the end.

   Therefore, in ""OUNCE"", E is at the end -> not ideal.

   ""MODEL"": M-O-D-E-L -> E is at position 4. That avoids the end (which is position 5). But we don't know if position 4 is correct? We just want to test more letters.

   Another word: ""LETUP"" -> but L-E-T-U-P. E is at position 2. But we don't know if we can use L, T, U, P.

   How about ""TOUCH"": but doesn't have E? So we can't test if E is in the word? But we already know E is in the word, so we must include E in this guess to try to pin its position? Actually, we can use a word without E? But that might not be efficient because we need to find the position of E. And we have only 5 more guesses.

   Since we know E is in the word, we should include it to get more positional information.

   So back to words that include E and are without R, A, I, S.

   ""MELON"" seems good: M-E-L-O-N. E is at position 2.

   Other options: ""BOTHE"" -> but that's not common and E is at the end? Avoid end E.

   ""NEEDY"": contains E twice? And D and Y. Also, second E at the end? We can avoid that because we know E is not at the end in the solution.

   Another: ""COMET"": C-O-M-E-T. E at position 4. This avoids the end and uses new letters.

   We might consider: ""COMET"" vs ""MELON"".

   Both introduce new letters. Let's compare:

      MELON: M, E, L, O, N
      COMET: C, O, M, E, T

   They both have E and O. MELON has L and N, COMET has C and T.

   T is one of the most common consonants, so maybe we should include T? Similarly, N is also common.

   Since we have eliminated R, A, I, S, we want to cover other high frequency letters: E is already known, then T, N, O, L are common.

   Both words cover T/N and L/C. Let's see what we have:

      Letters used so far: R, A, I, S, E. We introduced E but failed R,A,I,S.

      So for the next word, we want to test T, N, L, O, etc.

   Word ""COMET"": covers C, O, M, E, T -> we get to test T and M.

   But we already have M in MELON? Actually, we haven't used M yet? First word was RAISE: R,A,I,S,E. So M is untested.

   How about ""DOUTE"": not a word.

   Another: ""TOKEN"": T-O-K-E-N -> K is less common? But valid word. Using K might be a bit less efficient.

   We can try ""COUNT"": but C-O-U-N-T -> no E? So we skip E testing? We should include E.

   Therefore, I think ""COMET"" is a reasonable choice: it has E at position 4 (which is different from position 5) and introduces C, O, M, T.

   But note: O is a vowel, and we haven't tested it.

   Alternatively, ""MOUNT"": not because no E.

   Another option: ""BELOW"": but B-E-L-O-W -> E is at position 2. And letters are B, L, O, W. Avoids R,A,I,S.

   However, let's check if B has been tested? It hasn't.

   But ""BELOW"" uses W which is less common? Maybe we want to test higher frequency letters.

   By frequency: T is more common than W. So COMET might be better? Also, COMET uses T which is common.

   Therefore, I think ""COMET"" is a good choice.

   However, note: in ""COMET"", E is at position 4. We don't know if that's the correct position? We are trying to get feedback on E's position.

   Alternatively, we can try to put E at an entirely new position? For example, position 1? 

   Example: ""EBONY"": E-B-O-N-Y -> E is at position 1, which wasn't tested in the first word (RAISE had E at position 5). So we can test position 1.

   Also, EBONY introduces B, O, N, Y. O and N are common.

   How common? T is more common than B and Y. So might not be optimal.

   Another word with E at the start: ""ENACT"": E-N-A-C-T -> but A is eliminated? A is in the word? Wait, we cannot use A because it's eliminated. So invalid.

   ""EJECT"": not standard and uses J? Not common.

   ""ELOPE"": E-L-O-P-E -> E at both 1 and 5? But that might complicate and is also not efficient? Additionally, we know E isn't at 5. So why put it there? Avoid.

   ""ENTER"": but R is eliminated -> invalid.

   So, putting E at position 1 might be hard without using eliminated letters.

   How about position 3? Example: ""METRO"": but again, R is out -> invalid.

   ""LEMON"": but L-E-M-O-N -> same as MELON but rearranged. Then E is at position 2? Actually, MELON has E at 2. LEMON has E at 2? 

   Actually: 
      LEMON: L at position 1, E at 2, M at 3, O at 4, N at 5.

   But having E at position 2? Then we can test if E is at position 2? 

   We haven't tested position 2 yet: in RAISE, E was at position 5 and got minus. So positions 1,2,3,4 are unknown for E.

   So MELON (or LEMON) has E at 2. COMET has E at 4.

   Both are fine.

   Alternatively, we can also have E at position 3? Like ""DEUCE"" -> not common and U and C.

   After consideration, I think ""COMET"" is acceptable.

   But is ""COMET"" a valid word? Yes.

   However, let's consider including the next most common letters:

   After E, the next common consonants without R, S (which are eliminated) are T, N, L, C, D.

   In COMET: T, C, M, O -> M is common? Not as common as T, N, L.

   So maybe ""TENET"": but T-E-N-E-T? E twice and T twice? Also, E at position 2 and 4? But we know E is only at least one. This might complicate feedback? And it uses E twice, which if the word has only one E, we might get mixed signals? Also, we have only one E so far known.

   Another word: ""NOBLE"": N-O-B-L-E -> but E at the end? We avoid because we don't want to put E at the end.

   ""CEMENT"": not 5 letters.

   So perhaps the best is either MELON or COMET? 

   Let me look for a word that includes E in the middle and common letters T, N, O, etc.

   How about ""TONNE""? Not common? And has N twice? And E at the end? Avoid.

   ""LENTO"": L-E-N-T-O -> E at position 2. Uses L, N, T, O.

   That seems good: L, N, T are common consonants.

   So LENTO: 
        position1: L
        position2: E
        position3: N
        position4: T
        position5: O

   We avoid R, A, I, S? Yes: L, E, N, T, O.

   And E is at position 2, which we haven't tested.

   And we cover L, E, N, T, O. Even though E is known, we get to test its position.

   L, N, T are very common and we haven't tested them.

   So ""LENTO"" might be better? Because it covers T, N, L which are high frequency.

   Compare:

      COMET: C, O, M, E, T -> we cover T, O, M, E, C.

      LENTO: L, E, N, T, O -> we cover L, E, N, T, O.

   The letters L, N, T are more common than C, O, M? 

   Frequency in English for 5-letter words: 
      E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... 
      Since A, I, S are eliminated, then T, O, N are high.

      Then L is also common.

      M and C are less common than T, N, L? 

      Actually, T is very common (most common after E), so having T is good.

      Both have T and O? 

      In terms of information gain: LENTO introduces 4 new common letters: L, N, T, O? Wait, O is new? And E we know.

      Whereas COMET introduces T, O, M, C? 

      The letters we have not used: 
        Used: R, A, I, S, E (from first guess)
        New: if we use LENTO, we use L, N, T, O and E.
        So new letters: L, N, T, O.

        With COMET: new letters: C, O, M, T.

      Now, comparing frequency (approximate):

        T: very high (about 9% in 5-letter words)
        N: high (about 6%)
        L: high (about 4%)
        O: about 7%
        C: about 3%
        M: about 3%

      So T, N, O, L are more frequent than C, M.

      Therefore, LENTO seems better because it tests higher frequency letters.

   So I choose ""LENTO"".

   But note: O is a vowel. We have tested O? Not yet.

   Also, the word ""LENTO"" is valid? Yes.

   Therefore, our next guess: LENTO.

   We expect to get feedback on:
        L at position1
        E at position2 -> we know E is in the word, so we hope to find if it is at position2 or not? 
        N at position3
        T at position4
        O at position5

   This will give information about E's position as well.

   Let me confirm: 
     The secret word has E? Yes, but we don't know where. Also, O might be present? We don't know.

   We are prioritizing testing high frequency letters.

   So, I'll go with ""LENTO"".

   But wait, what if the secret word has double letters? Not likely? We don't have evidence of that.

   Therefore, the next guess is ""LENTO"".After evaluating the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"" where R, A, I, and S were absent (x) and E was present but misplaced (-), the strategy is to test high-frequency letters not yet tried while avoiding R, A, I, and S. The word must include E but not in the 5th position (since it was misplaced there in ""RAISE""). 

The chosen word ""LENTO"" introduces:
- **L, N, T, O**: High-frequency letters not previously tested.
- **E at position 2**: Tests a new position (positions 1-4 are unknown for E).
- Avoids eliminated letters (R, A, I, S).

This maximizes information gain:
- Tests E’s possible location.
- Covers common consonants (T, N, L) and vowel (O).
- Provides feedback that adjusts the search space effectively.

We need a good starting word.\n A good starting word typically has a mix of common vowels and consonants. \n The idea is to cover as many common letters as possible to get informative feedback.\n Popular starting words are often like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""RAISE"", ""ROATE"", etc.\n\n Considering this, let\'s choose ""RAISE"". \n Why ""RAISE""? \n   - It has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).\n   - It covers five distinct letters, which maximizes the information.\n\n So, I\'ll guess ""RAISE"".For the first guess, it\'s essential to choose a word that covers a mix of common vowels and consonants to gather maximum information. The word ""RAISE"" is an excellent starter because it includes three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), all distinct letters. This will help reveal which letters are in the secret word and their positions quickly.\n\n<guess>raise</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are on the second guess. The first guess was ""RAISE"" and the feedback was: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\n This means:\n   R is not in the secret word.\n   A is not in the secret word.\n   I is not in the secret word.\n   S is not in the secret word.\n   E is in the secret word but in the wrong position.\n\n So, we know:\n   The secret word contains the letter E, but not at the last position (since in ""RAISE"", E was at the end and it\'s wrong position).\n   Also, the secret word does not contain R, A, I, S.\n\n Given that E is present but not at the 5th position, it could be in one of the first four positions.\n\n Since the first guess eliminated R, A, I, S, we should choose a new word that:\n   - Includes E (because we know it\'s in the word) but not at the end.\n   - Uses other common letters that haven\'t been tried yet (like T, N, O, L, C, D, U, M, etc.), avoiding R, A, I, S.\n\n Let\'s think of a word that fits:\n   The new word must be 5 letters long, valid, and without R, A, I, S.\n\n We also note that E is not at the 5th position, so we can place E in positions 1-4.\n\n Possibilities for E: since it can\'t be at the end, we might put it at the beginning or in the middle.\n\n But note: although we know E is in the word, we don\'t know exactly where. We must try to cover multiple possibilities and include new common letters.\n\n Example words: \n   Could try ""TENOR"", but note that O and R: but wait, R was already ruled out, so we cannot use R. Similarly, we cannot use A, I, S.\n\n Revised: avoid R, A, I, S.\n\n So, let\'s think of words with E and other common letters. Some options:\n\n   E in position 1: e.g., ""E"", then four more letters without R,A,I,S. Example: ""ELOPE"", but L and O and P. Also, E would be at position 1, which is a new position. But note we have only one E so far? The feedback didn\'t say anything about multiple E\'s, so it\'s possible.\n\n   But we don\'t know the frequency. However, the feedback shows only one E was marked, so we know at least one E is present. If there were two E\'s, then the feedback might have shown two minuses? But note: if the word had two E\'s and one was in the correct position, it would show as correct. Since the E was marked as present but wrong position, that doesn\'t preclude another E. However, we don\'t have evidence of a second E yet.\n\n   We should avoid using E twice unless necessary? Since it\'s the second guess, we can focus on getting more information.\n\n Another idea: we want to cover more vowels? We know A and I are not present, so the vowels are only E? But possibly other vowels: O or U?\n\n What are the vowels? A, E, I, O, U. We know A and I are out, so we have O and U as possibilities.\n\n Let\'s choose a word that includes E (in a position other than 5), and also includes common consonants like T, N, L, etc., and another vowel (O or U).\n\n Example words:\n\n   ""TENOR"": contains R -> invalid because R is eliminated. So no.\n\n   ""MELON"": \n        M, E, L, O, N. \n        None of these are R, A, I, S. \n        E is in the second position (not 5th). \n        This word can help test for M, L, O, N and E.\n\n   Other possibilities: ""CLONE"", ""WHOLE"", ""OUNCE"", etc. But let\'s choose something without letters we know are out.\n\n   Another common word: ""HOUSE"": contains S -> S is eliminated? No, feedback said S(x), so S is not in the secret word. Therefore, we cannot use HOUSE because S is not allowed.\n\n   Similarly, we must avoid R, A, I, S.\n\n   ""MELON"" is okay: M, E, L, O, N.\n\n   ""EDUCU"" is not a word.\n\n   ""OUNCE"": O, U, N, C, E. E is at the end? But we want to avoid putting E at the end because we know E is not at the end? Actually, in the first word, E was at the end and marked as wrong position. That only means that E is present but not at position 5. It doesn\'t prevent E from being at the end in the next guess? Actually, we are allowed to guess words that have E at the end again, but it wouldn\'t be efficient because we know for the solution that E isn\'t at the end. So we can avoid putting E at the end.\n\n   Therefore, in ""OUNCE"", E is at the end -> not ideal.\n\n   ""MODEL"": M-O-D-E-L -> E is at position 4. That avoids the end (which is position 5). But we don\'t know if position 4 is correct? We just want to test more letters.\n\n   Another word: ""LETUP"" -> but L-E-T-U-P. E is at position 2. But we don\'t know if we can use L, T, U, P.\n\n   How about ""TOUCH"": but doesn\'t have E? So we can\'t test if E is in the word? But we already know E is in the word, so we must include E in this guess to try to pin its position? Actually, we can use a word without E? But that might not be efficient because we need to find the position of E. And we have only 5 more guesses.\n\n   Since we know E is in the word, we should include it to get more positional information.\n\n   So back to words that include E and are without R, A, I, S.\n\n   ""MELON"" seems good: M-E-L-O-N. E is at position 2.\n\n   Other options: ""BOTHE"" -> but that\'s not common and E is at the end? Avoid end E.\n\n   ""NEEDY"": contains E twice? And D and Y. Also, second E at the end? We can avoid that because we know E is not at the end in the solution.\n\n   Another: ""COMET"": C-O-M-E-T. E at position 4. This avoids the end and uses new letters.\n\n   We might consider: ""COMET"" vs ""MELON"".\n\n   Both introduce new letters. Let\'s compare:\n\n      MELON: M, E, L, O, N\n      COMET: C, O, M, E, T\n\n   They both have E and O. MELON has L and N, COMET has C and T.\n\n   T is one of the most common consonants, so maybe we should include T? Similarly, N is also common.\n\n   Since we have eliminated R, A, I, S, we want to cover other high frequency letters: E is already known, then T, N, O, L are common.\n\n   Both words cover T/N and L/C. Let\'s see what we have:\n\n      Letters used so far: R, A, I, S, E. We introduced E but failed R,A,I,S.\n\n      So for the next word, we want to test T, N, L, O, etc.\n\n   Word ""COMET"": covers C, O, M, E, T -> we get to test T and M.\n\n   But we already have M in MELON? Actually, we haven\'t used M yet? First word was RAISE: R,A,I,S,E. So M is untested.\n\n   How about ""DOUTE"": not a word.\n\n   Another: ""TOKEN"": T-O-K-E-N -> K is less common? But valid word. Using K might be a bit less efficient.\n\n   We can try ""COUNT"": but C-O-U-N-T -> no E? So we skip E testing? We should include E.\n\n   Therefore, I think ""COMET"" is a reasonable choice: it has E at position 4 (which is different from position 5) and introduces C, O, M, T.\n\n   But note: O is a vowel, and we haven\'t tested it.\n\n   Alternatively, ""MOUNT"": not because no E.\n\n   Another option: ""BELOW"": but B-E-L-O-W -> E is at position 2. And letters are B, L, O, W. Avoids R,A,I,S.\n\n   However, let\'s check if B has been tested? It hasn\'t.\n\n   But ""BELOW"" uses W which is less common? Maybe we want to test higher frequency letters.\n\n   By frequency: T is more common than W. So COMET might be better? Also, COMET uses T which is common.\n\n   Therefore, I think ""COMET"" is a good choice.\n\n   However, note: in ""COMET"", E is at position 4. We don\'t know if that\'s the correct position? We are trying to get feedback on E\'s position.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try to put E at an entirely new position? For example, position 1? \n\n   Example: ""EBONY"": E-B-O-N-Y -> E is at position 1, which wasn\'t tested in the first word (RAISE had E at position 5). So we can test position 1.\n\n   Also, EBONY introduces B, O, N, Y. O and N are common.\n\n   How common? T is more common than B and Y. So might not be optimal.\n\n   Another word with E at the start: ""ENACT"": E-N-A-C-T -> but A is eliminated? A is in the word? Wait, we cannot use A because it\'s eliminated. So invalid.\n\n   ""EJECT"": not standard and uses J? Not common.\n\n   ""ELOPE"": E-L-O-P-E -> E at both 1 and 5? But that might complicate and is also not efficient? Additionally, we know E isn\'t at 5. So why put it there? Avoid.\n\n   ""ENTER"": but R is eliminated -> invalid.\n\n   So, putting E at position 1 might be hard without using eliminated letters.\n\n   How about position 3? Example: ""METRO"": but again, R is out -> invalid.\n\n   ""LEMON"": but L-E-M-O-N -> same as MELON but rearranged. Then E is at position 2? Actually, MELON has E at 2. LEMON has E at 2? \n\n   Actually: \n      LEMON: L at position 1, E at 2, M at 3, O at 4, N at 5.\n\n   But having E at position 2? Then we can test if E is at position 2? \n\n   We haven\'t tested position 2 yet: in RAISE, E was at position 5 and got minus. So positions 1,2,3,4 are unknown for E.\n\n   So MELON (or LEMON) has E at 2. COMET has E at 4.\n\n   Both are fine.\n\n   Alternatively, we can also have E at position 3? Like ""DEUCE"" -> not common and U and C.\n\n   After consideration, I think ""COMET"" is acceptable.\n\n   But is ""COMET"" a valid word? Yes.\n\n   However, let\'s consider including the next most common letters:\n\n   After E, the next common consonants without R, S (which are eliminated) are T, N, L, C, D.\n\n   In COMET: T, C, M, O -> M is common? Not as common as T, N, L.\n\n   So maybe ""TENET"": but T-E-N-E-T? E twice and T twice? Also, E at position 2 and 4? But we know E is only at least one. This might complicate feedback? And it uses E twice, which if the word has only one E, we might get mixed signals? Also, we have only one E so far known.\n\n   Another word: ""NOBLE"": N-O-B-L-E -> but E at the end? We avoid because we don\'t want to put E at the end.\n\n   ""CEMENT"": not 5 letters.\n\n   So perhaps the best is either MELON or COMET? \n\n   Let me look for a word that includes E in the middle and common letters T, N, O, etc.\n\n   How about ""TONNE""? Not common? And has N twice? And E at the end? Avoid.\n\n   ""LENTO"": L-E-N-T-O -> E at position 2. Uses L, N, T, O.\n\n   That seems good: L, N, T are common consonants.\n\n   So LENTO: \n        position1: L\n        position2: E\n        position3: N\n        position4: T\n        position5: O\n\n   We avoid R, A, I, S? Yes: L, E, N, T, O.\n\n   And E is at position 2, which we haven\'t tested.\n\n   And we cover L, E, N, T, O. Even though E is known, we get to test its position.\n\n   L, N, T are very common and we haven\'t tested them.\n\n   So ""LENTO"" might be better? Because it covers T, N, L which are high frequency.\n\n   Compare:\n\n      COMET: C, O, M, E, T -> we cover T, O, M, E, C.\n\n      LENTO: L, E, N, T, O -> we cover L, E, N, T, O.\n\n   The letters L, N, T are more common than C, O, M? \n\n   Frequency in English for 5-letter words: \n      E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... \n      Since A, I, S are eliminated, then T, O, N are high.\n\n      Then L is also common.\n\n      M and C are less common than T, N, L? \n\n      Actually, T is very common (most common after E), so having T is good.\n\n      Both have T and O? \n\n      In terms of information gain: LENTO introduces 4 new common letters: L, N, T, O? Wait, O is new? And E we know.\n\n      Whereas COMET introduces T, O, M, C? \n\n      The letters we have not used: \n        Used: R, A, I, S, E (from first guess)\n        New: if we use LENTO, we use L, N, T, O and E.\n        So new letters: L, N, T, O.\n\n        With COMET: new letters: C, O, M, T.\n\n      Now, comparing frequency (approximate):\n\n        T: very high (about 9% in 5-letter words)\n        N: high (about 6%)\n        L: high (about 4%)\n        O: about 7%\n        C: about 3%\n        M: about 3%\n\n      So T, N, O, L are more frequent than C, M.\n\n      Therefore, LENTO seems better because it tests higher frequency letters.\n\n   So I choose ""LENTO"".\n\n   But note: O is a vowel. We have tested O? Not yet.\n\n   Also, the word ""LENTO"" is valid? Yes.\n\n   Therefore, our next guess: LENTO.\n\n   We expect to get feedback on:\n        L at position1\n        E at position2 -> we know E is in the word, so we hope to find if it is at position2 or not? \n        N at position3\n        T at position4\n        O at position5\n\n   This will give information about E\'s position as well.\n\n   Let me confirm: \n     The secret word has E? Yes, but we don\'t know where. Also, O might be present? We don\'t know.\n\n   We are prioritizing testing high frequency letters.\n\n   So, I\'ll go with ""LENTO"".\n\n   But wait, what if the secret word has double letters? Not likely? We don\'t have evidence of that.\n\n   Therefore, the next guess is ""LENTO"".After evaluating the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"" where R, A, I, and S were absent (x) and E was present but misplaced (-), the strategy is to test high-frequency letters not yet tried while avoiding R, A, I, and S.

Based on the feedback from the two guesses:

**Feedback Summary:**
- Guess 1 (""RAISE""): R(x), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(-)
  - E is in the secret word but not in the 5th position (since it was the last letter and marked -).

- Guess 2 (""LENTO""): L(x), E(-), N(-), T(x), O(-)
  - L and T are not in the word.
  - E, N, and O are in the word but in the wrong positions.

**Key Inferences:**
1. **Eliminated Letters:** R, A, I, S, L, T are confirmed absent. So the secret word contains none of these letters.
2. **Present Letters:** E, N, O are confirmed present. Each of these is in the secret word but not in the positions guessed.
3. **E Position:** E is present but not at position 5 (as in ""RAISE"") and not at position 2 (as in ""LENTO""). So E cannot be at position 2 or 5 in the secret word.
4. **N Position:** N is present but not at position 3 (where it was in ""LENTO"").
5. **O Position:** O is present but not at position 5 (where it was in ""LENTO"").

**Available Letters:** 
Since E, N, O are in the word, and we know they must be placed in different positions, we also need to account for two more letters (since it's a 5-letter word). Given the eliminated letters, we focus on remaining common vowels and consonants like B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

**Constraints for Positions:**
- E cannot be at position 2 or 5 (from feedback). Possible positions: 1, 3, or 4.
- N cannot be at position 3 (from ""LENTO""). Possible positions: 1, 2, 4, or 5.
- O cannot be at position 5 (from ""LENTO""). Possible positions: 1, 2, 3, or 4.

**Strategy for Next Guess:**
- We must include E, N, and O. Avoid eliminated letters: R, A, I, S, L, T.
- The guess should place E, N, and O in new positions to test valid locations while introducing 1-2 new high-frequency letters (e.g., D, C, M, U, etc.).
- Focus on positions where E, N, O could reasonably fit based on common words.

**Possible Positions Exploration:**
- Given E can be at 1, 3, or 4, let's consider common placements:
  - E at the start: Words like E...? 
  - E in the middle: Positions 3 or 4.
- Similarly, N could be at the end (position 5), given it wasn't ruled out there, or elsewhere.

**Word Selection:**
We need a word that:
- Contains E, N, O.
- Uses none of: R, A, I, S, L, T.
- Places E not at position 5 (already known), not at position 2 (tested), and similarly adjusts for N and O.

Examples:
- ""CONED"": C-O-N-E-D -> Positions: O(1), N(2), E(3? But we need to avoid positions... wait). However, we can test E at position 4? In ""CONED"": C(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), D(5).
  - This places E at position 4 (new, not yet tested), N at position 3 (which was forbidden? In ""LENTO"", N was at position 3 and marked -, so N at 3 is incorrect). Therefore, ""CONED"" would reuse position 3 for N, which is invalid (already tested and wrong), so avoid N at position 3.
- Other words: ""OUNCE"" -> O-U-N-C-E. Positions: O(1), U(2), N(3), C(4), E(5). Problem: E at position 5 is ruled out (from first guess), so invalid position for E here.
- ""MONDE"" (not a common word), and E at end? No.
- ""DOZEN"": D-O-Z-E-N -> O at position 2? (not yet tested), Z is less common, and E at position 4, N at position 5. This avoids reused positions: E was never at position 4? Yes. N was at position 3 before (wrong), so N at position 5 is new.
  - Letters: D, O, Z, E, N — avoid eliminated? Yes (Z is allowed since not eliminated).
- ""HONEY"": H-O-N-E-Y -> Positions: H(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), Y(5). Problem: N is at position 3 again? We know N cannot be at position 3 (from feedback), so avoid.
- ""OZONE"": O at position 1 and 3? But repeats O, and we don't know if O is duplicated. Also O at position 1 and E at position 5? Position 5 E ruled out.
- ""ODEON"": Not common; and E at position 2? But position 2 for E was tested and wrong (in LENTO E was at 2 and was minus). O at position 1 (not tested), N at position 5? But O at position 1 and position 4?
- More promising: Consider E at position 1? Like ""ENVOY"": E-N-V-O-Y -> Positions: E(1), N(2), V(3), O(4), Y(5). This avoids reused positions: 
  - E at position 1 (not tested before — previously at 5 and 2).
  - N at position 2 (not tested before — previously at 3).
- ""DEPOT"": Contains T, which is eliminated? T(x) from guess 2, so T is out — cannot use.
- Better: ""MONEY"" — M-O-N-E-Y, but E is position 4? And N position 3? N position 3 wrong position already known.

**Optimal Word Choice:**
After rejecting several options, ""ENVOY"" fits well because:
- Positions: E(1), N(2), V(3), O(4), Y(5)
- Avoids eliminated letters: No R, A, I, S, L, T.
- Introduces new common letters: V, Y, and tests E at position 1 (new), N at position 2 (new), O at position 4 (new). Position 5 Y is safe to test.
- Feedback potential: Will clarify positions for E, N, O effectively.

Why not other words? For example:
- ""CONVEY"" is 6 letters? Not 5.
- ""MOVED"": Contains M and D? But E at position 4? N is missing? We must include N.
- We must include all three known letters: E, N, O.

Thus, ""ENVOY"" is a strong candidate: E, N, O are included at untested positions, and new letters V and Y are tested.

**Conclusion:**
Guess ""ENVOY"" to maximize information on the positions of E, N, O while testing two new letters (V and Y).

Based on the feedback:  
- **Eliminated letters:** R, A, I, S, L, T (not in the word).  
- **Confirmed letters:** E, N, O (must be in the word, but not in positions tested before).  
  - E cannot be at positions 2 or 5.  
  - N cannot be at position 3.  
  - O cannot be at position 5.  

**Strategy for Guess 3:**  
- Include all confirmed letters (E, N, O) in new positions to pinpoint their locations.  
- Avoid eliminated letters.  
- Test new high-frequency consonants/vowels (e.g., D, C, M, U) but prioritize placing E, N, O first.  
- Possible positions:  
  - E: Try position 1 (previously untested positions: 1, 3, 4).  
  - N: Try position 2 (previously untested: 1, 2, 4, 5).  
  - O: Try position 4 (previously untested: 1, 2, 3, 4).

  - E is in the secret word but not in the 5th position (since it was the last letter and marked -).

- Guess 2 (""LENTO""): L(x), E(-), N(-), T(x), O(-)
  - L and T are not in the word.
  - E, N, and O are in the word but in the wrong positions.

**Key Inferences:**
1. **Eliminated Letters:** R, A, I, S, L, T are confirmed absent. So the secret word contains none of these letters.
2. **Present Letters:** E, N, O are confirmed present. Each of these is in the secret word but not in the positions guessed.
3. **E Position:** E is present but not at position 5 (as in ""RAISE"") and not at position 2 (as in ""LENTO""). So E cannot be at position 2 or 5 in the secret word.
4. **N Position:** N is present but not at position 3 (where it was in ""LENTO"").
5. **O Position:** O is present but not at position 5 (where it was in ""LENTO"").

**Available Letters:** 
Since E, N, O are in the word, and we know they must be placed in different positions, we also need to account for two more letters (since it's a 5-letter word). Given the eliminated letters, we focus on remaining common vowels and consonants like B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

**Constraints for Positions:**
- E cannot be at position 2 or 5 (from feedback). Possible positions: 1, 3, or 4.
- N cannot be at position 3 (from ""LENTO""). Possible positions: 1, 2, 4, or 5.
- O cannot be at position 5 (from ""LENTO""). Possible positions: 1, 2, 3, or 4.

**Strategy for Next Guess:**
- We must include E, N, and O. Avoid eliminated letters: R, A, I, S, L, T.
- The guess should place E, N, and O in new positions to test valid locations while introducing 1-2 new high-frequency letters (e.g., D, C, M, U, etc.).
- Focus on positions where E, N, O could reasonably fit based on common words.

**Possible Positions Exploration:**
- Given E can be at 1, 3, or 4, let's consider common placements:
  - E at the start: Words like E...? 
  - E in the middle: Positions 3 or 4.
- Similarly, N could be at the end (position 5), given it wasn't ruled out there, or elsewhere.

**Word Selection:**
We need a word that:
- Contains E, N, O.
- Uses none of: R, A, I, S, L, T.
- Places E not at position 5 (already known), not at position 2 (tested), and similarly adjusts for N and O.

Examples:
- ""CONED"": C-O-N-E-D -> Positions: O(1), N(2), E(3? But we need to avoid positions... wait). However, we can test E at position 4? In ""CONED"": C(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), D(5).
  - This places E at position 4 (new, not yet tested), N at position 3 (which was forbidden? In ""LENTO"", N was at position 3 and marked -, so N at 3 is incorrect). Therefore, ""CONED"" would reuse position 3 for N, which is invalid (already tested and wrong), so avoid N at position 3.
- Other words: ""OUNCE"" -> O-U-N-C-E. Positions: O(1), U(2), N(3), C(4), E(5). Problem: E at position 5 is ruled out (from first guess), so invalid position for E here.
- ""MONDE"" (not a common word), and E at end? No.
- ""DOZEN"": D-O-Z-E-N -> O at position 2? (not yet tested), Z is less common, and E at position 4, N at position 5. This avoids reused positions: E was never at position 4? Yes. N was at position 3 before (wrong), so N at position 5 is new.
  - Letters: D, O, Z, E, N — avoid eliminated? Yes (Z is allowed since not eliminated).
- ""HONEY"": H-O-N-E-Y -> Positions: H(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), Y(5). Problem: N is at position 3 again? We know N cannot be at position 3 (from feedback), so avoid.
- ""OZONE"": O at position 1 and 3? But repeats O, and we don't know if O is duplicated. Also O at position 1 and E at position 5? Position 5 E ruled out.
- ""ODEON"": Not common; and E at position 2? But position 2 for E was tested and wrong (in LENTO E was at 2 and was minus). O at position 1 (not tested), N at position 5? But O at position 1 and position 4?
- More promising: Consider E at position 1? Like ""ENVOY"": E-N-V-O-Y -> Positions: E(1), N(2), V(3), O(4), Y(5). This avoids reused positions: 
  - E at position 1 (not tested before — previously at 5 and 2).
  - N at position 2 (not tested before — previously at 3).
- ""DEPOT"": Contains T, which is eliminated? T(x) from guess 2, so T is out — cannot use.
- Better: ""MONEY"" — M-O-N-E-Y, but E is position 4? And N position 3? N position 3 wrong position already known.

**Optimal Word Choice:**
After rejecting several options, ""ENVOY"" fits well because:
- Positions: E(1), N(2), V(3), O(4), Y(5)
- Avoids eliminated letters: No R, A, I, S, L, T.
- Introduces new common letters: V, Y, and tests E at position 1 (new), N at position 2 (new), O at position 4 (new). Position 5 Y is safe to test.
- Feedback potential: Will clarify positions for E, N, O effectively.

Why not other words? For example:
- ""CONVEY"" is 6 letters? Not 5.
- ""MOVED"": Contains M and D? But E at position 4? N is missing? We must include N.
- We must include all three known letters: E, N, O.

Thus, ""ENVOY"" is a strong candidate: E, N, O are included at untested positions, and new letters V and Y are tested.

**Conclusion:**
Guess ""ENVOY"" to maximize information on the positions of E, N, O while testing two new letters (V and Y).Based on the feedback:  
- **Eliminated letters:** R, A, I, S, L, T (not in the word).  
- **Confirmed letters:** E, N, O (must be in the word, but not in positions tested before).  
  - E cannot be at positions 2 or 5.  
  - N cannot be at position 3.  
  - O cannot be at position 5.  

**Strategy for Guess 3:**  
- Include all confirmed letters (E, N, O) in new positions to pinpoint their locations.  
- Avoid eliminated letters.  
- Test new high-frequency consonants/vowels (e.g., D, C, M, U) but prioritize placing E, N, O first.  
- Possible positions:  
  - E: Try position 1 (previously untested positions: 1, 3, 4).  
  - N: Try position 2 (previously untested: 1, 2, 4, 5).  
  - O: Try position 4 (previously untested: 1, 2, 3, 4).  

**Chosen word: ENVOY**  
- Positions: E(1), N(2), V(3), O(4), Y(5)  
- Why?  
  - Tests E at position 1 (new), N at position 2 (new), O at position 4 (new).  
  - Introduces new letters: V and Y.  
  - Avoids all eliminated letters.  
  - Maximizes positional information for E, N, O.",Guess 3: envoy -> FEEDBACK: E(✓) N(✓) V(✓) O(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
