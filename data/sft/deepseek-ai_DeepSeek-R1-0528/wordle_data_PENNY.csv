We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C(x) -> C is not in the secret word.
 R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.
 A(x) -> A is not in the secret word.
 N(✓) -> N is in the word and in the correct position (at the 4th letter).
 E(-) -> E is in the word but in the wrong position.

 So, we know:
 - The 4th letter is N.
 - E is in the word, but not in the 5th position (since that's where we guessed it and we got a '-', meaning wrong position).
 - The secret word does not contain C, R, or A.

 Since N is at the 4th position, the word is: _ _ _ N _

 Also, E is in the word but not at the 5th position. Therefore, E must be in one of the first three position? Actually, the positions are 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 5th? No, wait: our guess was CRANE, which is:
 Position 1: C
 Position 2: R
 Position 3: A
 Position 4: N
 Position 5: E

 So the feedback tells us:
 - N is correct at position 4.
 - E is present but not at position 5. So E must be in positions 1, 2, or 3? But note: the word has 5 letters. Actually, the secret word has E in it, but not at position 5. It could be at position 1, 2, 3, or even at position 4? But position 4 is taken by N. So E must be at position 1, 2, or 3.

 However, we also know that the secret word does not contain C, R, A (because they are marked as absent). So the first three letters cannot be C, R, or A.

 Since E is in the word but not at the end, and we have the fourth letter as N, let's summarize:

 Secret word: [not C, R, A] [not C, R, A] [not C, R, A] N [some letter]

 And the word must contain E, which must be in one of positions 1, 2, 3.

 We now need to make a second guess that incorporates this information.

 Goals for the next guess:
 1. We must include E (because it is present) but not in the last position? Actually, we are not forced to avoid E in the last position? Actually, we know E is not at the 5th position in the secret word? But in our guess, we can put E anywhere? However, note that in the secret word, E is not at position 5.

 But we also know that the 4th letter is N.

 So let's list possible words:
 Pattern: _ _ _ N _

 Constraints:
 - The word has E in one of positions 1,2,3.
 - The word does not have C, R, A.

 Also, we can consider using letters that are common to gather more information about other letters.

 Alternatively, we can try to break down the positions:

 We can target positions 1,2,3, and 5.

 We know position 4 is fixed as N.

 For the next guess, we could try putting E in each of positions 1,2,3? But we don't know which one.

 Additionally, we don't know about the other letters.

 Let's try a word that has:
 - E in position 1, and includes other common letters that we haven't tested (since we only know that C,R,A are absent, we have a lot of letters left).

 Common consonants: we could try S, T, L, etc.

 But note: we have to avoid C, R, A.

 Possible second guess: ""SENTE"" -> but that has two E's? We don't know if the word allows duplicates? But the rules don't prohibit duplicates? Actually, the feedback symbols can handle duplicates? However, according to the game, duplicates are allowed? But note: in the example, there were no duplicates. But let me recall standard wordle: duplicates are allowed in the secret word? Actually, the rules might vary? But in this game, the problem says: ""After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.""

 Since the feedback does not specify rules about duplicates, I'll assume that the word can have duplicate letters? But in the absence of specific rules, I'll try to avoid duplicates to maximize information.

 However, note: if the secret word has duplicate E, then we could have two E's? But we don't know. So we should be cautious.

 But we have E present and we know it's not at position 5, so let's try placing E in position 1.

 One common word: EXIST? But that has S and T? However, we don't know if they are in the word.

 Alternatively, let's pick a word that has E in one of positions 1,2,3, and uses as many new letters as possible.

 Since we know the 4th letter is N, we can lock that in.

 Proposed structure: [E? or else] ... N and then the fifth letter.

 But also, we must avoid the letters C, R, A.

 Let me think of words with the pattern: 
 - First letter: ? (not C,R,A) and must include E somewhere in the first three positions.

 Possibilities: 
 If E is at position 1: E _ _ N _
    Example: ELINT? Not common ... 
    E in position 1: E_G_N, E_L_N, etc.

 Alternatively, we don't need to include E? Actually, we know E is present so we should include it to figure out its position? And also because we have limited guesses.

 Actually, we must include E in the word? No, but we can; but we should because we need to figure out where it is.

 Let me try a word like ""LEMON"": 
  L E M O N
 But we have N at the fourth position? In the word ""lemon"", the fourth letter is 'O', not 'N'. So that doesn't fit our pattern? Our pattern must have N at the fourth position.

 So the word must be: _ _ _ N _

 Now, with E present in the first three positions.

 Example words:
 Position 1: Examples: E? E at pos1: E__N_ -> E then two more letters then N then one. Words: ""eaten"", ""elton"", ""even""? But ""eaten"" has T and E? Or ""exine""? Not common.

 Position 2: _ E _ N _ : ""spent"", ""spend"", ""spent"", ""event""? But note: ""spent"": S, P, E, N, T -> N at fourth. And E at third? Actually: 
 Position 2: E? For instance: ""begin"" -> B E G I N -> N at fifth? No. 

 The positions for a word: 
 For a word with E at position 2 and N at position 4: 
 Positions: 1: ?, 2: E, 3: ?, 4: N, 5: ?

 Example: ""taken""? But ""taken"": T at1, A at2? But A is absent? So we cannot use A? Because we know A is not in the word? So ""taken"" is invalid.

 Position 3: _ _ E N _ : ""silent"": 
  - S at1, I at2, L? ... let me spell: ""silent"" -> S I L E N T -> fourth letter is E? not N? Actually: 
  S (1), I (2), L (3), E (4), N (5) -> not matching.

 We need: 
 Position 4 must be N.

 Example: ""queen"" -> QUEEN: Q (1), U (2), E (3), E (4), N (5). 
 But in our case: the fourth letter is N? So that doesn't work.

 Actually, let's list words that end with N? And have E in the first three? And avoid A, C, R.

 Also, note: we don't know about the first, second, third, and fifth letters? We know they are not C, R, A.

 So, let's pick a word that:
 - Has the 4th letter as N.
 - Includes E in one of positions 1,2,3.
 - Uses other common letters that we haven't tested.

 We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Possible words:
 ""SENT"" is four letters? So 5-letter words:

 Let me try: 
  - Position 3: E -> _ _ E N _
      Examples: token, laden, oaten? But no A? So token: T O K E N -> 
        T at1, O at2, K at3, E at4? No: 
        T (1), O (2), K (3), E (4), N (5) -> so fourth letter is E? That's not N.

 We need fourth letter to be N? So the word is ???N?.

 And E is in the first three: 
 Pattern: [letter1] [letter2] [letter3] N [letter5]

 Then E must be in letter1, letter2, or letter3.

 So:

 Pattern: E [ ] [ ] N [ ] 
 Pattern: [ ] E [ ] N [ ]
 Pattern: [ ] [ ] E N [ ]

 Now, words:

 Pattern 1: ""begin"" -> B E G I N -> but N is at fifth? Not fourth.

 Let me reconsider: we need N at fourth? So the word is:
  1: ?
  2: ?
  3: ?
  4: N
  5: ?

 And E must be at pos1,2, or3.

 Example: 
  E at pos1: ""eatin"" not a word? ""eatin"" non-standard. 
  How about ""eosin""? E O S I N -> E at1, O at2, S at3, I at4? Wait: 
      E (1), O(2), S(3), I(4), N(5) -> then fourth isn't N? That doesn't work.

 Another: ""eikon"": E I K O N -> 
    E(1), I(2), K(3), O(4), N(5) -> again, fourth is not N.

 What words end with ...N? Actually, the fourth letter being N? Then fifth letter can be anything? But the word must be 5 letters.

 Example: ""green"" -> G R E E N -> 
  G(1), R(2), E(3), E(4), N(5) -> but in this case:
  The fourth letter is E? Not N.

 How about ""thine"": T H I N E -> 
  T(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), E(5) -> 
  Wait, that's: 
    4th: N -> correct position? 
    E is at the fifth? But our feedback for ""crane"" had E at fifth and we got a dash meaning E is present but in wrong position? 

  Wait: that doesn't match because the secret word has E but not at fifth? So if the secret word were ""thine"", then E would be at fifth? But we guessed E at fifth and the feedback was '-' meaning in the word but wrong position? If E is at fifth, then that would be correct? So it would have been marked with '✓'. 

  Therefore, the secret word has E, but not at the fifth position? So ""thine"" would have E at fifth? Which would be correct? But we got '-' for E? That means the fifth letter of the secret word is not E? 

  So let's rule out E at fifth.

  Therefore, ""thine"" would be: T(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), E(5) -> for E at fifth: if secret word had E at fifth, it would be marked ✓. But we got '-', meaning E is present but not at fifth? So we are sure that fifth is not E.

  Hence, the fifth letter cannot be E? So in the secret word, E is in one of the first three.

  Thus, words like ""thine"" are invalid? Because the E at fifth would be ✓? But we got '-'.

  So, back to our pattern: 
  Secret word: _ _ _ N ? (where ? cannot be E)

  And E must be in position 1,2, or 3.

  Now, an example: ""spine"": 
    S P I N E -> 
    Position 4: N? Actually: 
        S(1), P(2), I(3), N(4), E(5) -> E at fifth? We just said fifth cannot be E? Because we got a dash for E at fifth? 

  But wait: we guessed E at fifth and got '-', meaning E is in the word but not at fifth? So spine would put E at fifth? So that would be invalid? 

  Unless the secret word does have E at fifth? Then why did we get '-'? Maybe I misunderstood? 

  Let me check the feedback: for the word ""crane"", we got E(-) meaning E is present in the secret but not in the fifth position? So the secret word does not have the fifth letter as E? 

  Hence, spine's fifth letter is E? So it would be incompatible? 

  Actually, spine: 
    Guess: S P I N E -> 
    If secret is spine, then E is at fifth? So the feedback would have been E(✓) for fifth? But we had the previous feedback for E as '-'? So that's not the secret.

  How about ""shine"": 
    S H I N ? -> but then fifth? If fifth is not E? Let me try words that end with T? 
    ""spent"": 
      S P E N T -> 
        S(1), P(2), E(3), N(4), T(5) -> 
        This fits: 
          N is at fourth? 
          E is at third? 
          And fifth letter is T? 

        So E is at third? 

        That matches: we have N at fourth and E not at fifth? 

        Also, spent doesn't use C,R,A? 

        But we haven't tested S,P,T? So let's consider.

  Another: ""token"": 
    T O K E N -> 
        T(1), O(2), K(3), E(4), N(5) -> 
        Here the fourth letter is E? That's not N? 

  Only words that have N at fourth and a non-E fifth letter?

  So pattern: _ _ _ N X, where X != E, and one of the first three must be E.

  Other words that fit: 
  ""linen"": 
    L I N E N -> 
        L(1), I(2), N(3), E(4), N(5) -> 
        So the fourth letter is E? Not N? 

  ""minim"": doesn't have E.

  ""demon"": 
    D E M O N -> 
        D(1), E(2), M(3), O(4), N(5) -> 
        So fourth letter is O? 

  Not matching.

  Let's try: 
    . E ? N ? -> so position2: E, then any letter at position3? 
    Example: ""xenon""? 
        X E N O N -> 
        X(1), E(2), N(3) ... -> then fourth letter is O? not N? 

  Actually, N is third? 

  Alternatively, try: . . E N ? 
    Example: ""spent"", ""spend"" (if allowed? wordle accepts spend), ""shend""? 

  ""spend"": 
    S(1), P(2), E(3), N(4), D(5) -> perfect: 
      N at fourth (so ✓ for N at fourth), 
      E at third (but we guessed E at fifth? so we don't know yet where E is).

  This meets our pattern? 
      The secret word must have E? So if the word is ""spend"", then E is at third.

  We need to use a word for our guess that:
    - Has the 4th letter as N? This is fixed? Because we know position4 is N? 
    - And contains E? But we don't know where? We can try different placements? 

  Since we don't want to guess the word right away? We want to maximize information.

  Alternatively, let's try to find a word that includes E and places it in a new position (not fifth) and tests multiple new letters.

  Proposed guess: ""scone"" -> but C is absent? We cannot use C? Avoid C,R,A.

  So we can't use C.

  Another: ""phone"" -> 
    P H O N E -> 
        P(1), H(2), O(3), N(4), E(5)
        Wait: since we fixed the fourth letter as N? We can put N at fourth? 
        But then E at fifth? We know the fifth letter isn't E? So why put E at fifth? 
        Also, we'll get feedback on E? But we already know E is in the word, but not at fifth? 

        For the fifth letter: we put E -> but the secret word doesn't have E there? So we would get a dash or absent? 

        Actually, we know from the feedback that the secret word has E? It will mark this E? 

        But it's better to put E somewhere else? To see if it lands in positions 1,2,3.

  Alternatively, avoid putting E at fifth? 

  So let's choose a word that:
    - Has N at the fourth position (locked).
    - Has E in position 1, 2, or 3.
    - Avoids C,R,A.
    - Uses new common letters such as S, T, L, P, etc.

  Example: 
    Position 3: E? -> so pattern: _ _ E N _

    Let's pick ""stend""? Not common? Or ""steed"": 
        S T E E D -> 
        Position 4: E! not N.

  ""steed"" would be: S(1), T(2), E(3), E(4), D(5) -> fourth is E? not good.

  ""spent"": S P E N T -> 
    Pattern: S(1), P(2), E(3), N(4), T(5) -> perfect.

  Is ""spent"" a valid word? I think so.

  Another option: ""spend"", given above.

  But note: we want to test letters? We haven't tested S or P or T? So it would be informative.

  Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn't fix E? But that might be less efficient? We need to test for E anyway? 

  Given the constraints, let's choose ""spent"".

  So our next guess: ""spent""

  The feedback will tell us:
    For S, P, E, T: 
    Specifically, we hope to learn about S, P, E, and T.

  And we confirm N is at 4th -> will receive ✓ at N.

  We guess the word: spent.

  But note: the secret might not have E at position 3? Because E could be at position 1 or 2. Our guess ""spent"" has E at 3. So if the secret word has E at position 1 or 2, then the E in this guess would be marked as '-'? 

  And we will get information about the absence/presence of S, P, T.

  Alternatively, if we don't want to commit to E in one position, we could try a word that has E in a different position? But we have to pick one.

  Another idea: use two E's? For example, ""bevel"" -> but no: because no N at fourth? And B is untested.

  But fixed pattern: we must have N at fourth? So we have no choice but to guess a word that has N at fourth.

  Therefore, let's go with ""spent"". 

  Another word that has E at position 1 and N at fourth: Eaten? But it contains A? Absent. 
  E at position 2: ""leant""? Again, A? 
  Or ""event"": 
    E V E N T -> 
        E(1), V(2), E(3), N(4), T(5) 
        But that has two E's? 

  But what does feedback do for duplicate letters? 
  For example, if the secret word is ""baton"", and we guess ""hating"", then first H is absent? and then second A is present? and so on? 

  However, to keep it simple, since ""spent"" doesn't use duplicates, let's go with it.

  So next guess: spent

  But note: the feedback for E in this guess will be:
    - If the secret word has E at position 3: then we get ✓ for E at third.
    - If the secret word has E at position 1: then since we guessed E at third? We would get a dash? 
    - Similarly, if at position 2? dash? 

  But also, we gather information about S and P?

  Also, note: T at fifth? If the secret word has T at fifth? Then we might get ✓ for T? But note: if not, we might get info that T is present or not.

  So I think ""spent"" is a good choice.

  Let me look for more words? 
    E at 1: ... maybe ""elint"" (not common)?
    E at 2: ... ""segment"" is too long? or ""lemon"" not fit? 

  Since we don't know, it's best to gather as much information as possible.

  So I choose ""spent"".

  Therefore, the guess is: spent

<guess>spent</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A are absent (marked 'x').
- N is in the correct position (4th, marked '✓').
- E is present but not in the 5th position (marked '-').

This means:
- The secret word format is `_ _ _ N _`.
- E must appear in one of positions 1, 2, or 3 (since it's not in position 5, and position 4 is N).
- C, R, A are eliminated.

For the next guess, I chose **""spent""** because:
- It locks in N at position 4.
- Places E in position 3 to test its placement.
- Introduces new common letters (S, P, T) to maximize information.
- Avoids excluded letters (C, R, A).

<guess>spent</guess>",spent,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C(x) -> C is not in the secret word.
 R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.
 A(x) -> A is not in the secret word.
 N(✓) -> N is in the word and in the correct position (at the 4th letter).
 E(-) -> E is in the word but in the wrong position.

 So, we know:
 - The 4th letter is N.
 - E is in the word, but not in the 5th position (since that's where we guessed it and we got a '-', meaning wrong position).
 - The secret word does not contain C, R, or A.

 Since N is at the 4th position, the word is: _ _ _ N _

 Also, E is in the word but not at the 5th position. Therefore, E must be in one of the first three position? Actually, the positions are 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 5th? No, wait: our guess was CRANE, which is:
 Position 1: C
 Position 2: R
 Position 3: A
 Position 4: N
 Position 5: E

 So the feedback tells us:
 - N is correct at position 4.
 - E is present but not at position 5. So E must be in positions 1, 2, or 3? But note: the word has 5 letters. Actually, the secret word has E in it, but not at position 5. It could be at position 1, 2, 3, or even at position 4? But position 4 is taken by N. So E must be at position 1, 2, or 3.

 However, we also know that the secret word does not contain C, R, A (because they are marked as absent). So the first three letters cannot be C, R, or A.

 Since E is in the word but not at the end, and we have the fourth letter as N, let's summarize:

 Secret word: [not C, R, A] [not C, R, A] [not C, R, A] N [some letter]

 And the word must contain E, which must be in one of positions 1, 2, 3.

 We now need to make a second guess that incorporates this information.

 Goals for the next guess:
 1. We must include E (because it is present) but not in the last position? Actually, we are not forced to avoid E in the last position? Actually, we know E is not at the 5th position in the secret word? But in our guess, we can put E anywhere? However, note that in the secret word, E is not at position 5.

 But we also know that the 4th letter is N.

 So let's list possible words:
 Pattern: _ _ _ N _

 Constraints:
 - The word has E in one of positions 1,2,3.
 - The word does not have C, R, A.

 Also, we can consider using letters that are common to gather more information about other letters.

 Alternatively, we can try to break down the positions:

 We can target positions 1,2,3, and 5.

 We know position 4 is fixed as N.

 For the next guess, we could try putting E in each of positions 1,2,3? But we don't know which one.

 Additionally, we don't know about the other letters.

 Let's try a word that has:
 - E in position 1, and includes other common letters that we haven't tested (since we only know that C,R,A are absent, we have a lot of letters left).

 Common consonants: we could try S, T, L, etc.

 But note: we have to avoid C, R, A.

 Possible second guess: ""SENTE"" -> but that has two E's? We don't know if the word allows duplicates? But the rules don't prohibit duplicates? Actually, the feedback symbols can handle duplicates? However, according to the game, duplicates are allowed? But note: in the example, there were no duplicates. But let me recall standard wordle: duplicates are allowed in the secret word? Actually, the rules might vary? But in this game, the problem says: ""After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.""

 Since the feedback does not specify rules about duplicates, I'll assume that the word can have duplicate letters? But in the absence of specific rules, I'll try to avoid duplicates to maximize information.

 However, note: if the secret word has duplicate E, then we could have two E's? But we don't know. So we should be cautious.

 But we have E present and we know it's not at position 5, so let's try placing E in position 1.

 One common word: EXIST? But that has S and T? However, we don't know if they are in the word.

 Alternatively, let's pick a word that has E in one of positions 1,2,3, and uses as many new letters as possible.

 Since we know the 4th letter is N, we can lock that in.

 Proposed structure: [E? or else] ... N and then the fifth letter.

 But also, we must avoid the letters C, R, A.

 Let me think of words with the pattern: 
 - First letter: ? (not C,R,A) and must include E somewhere in the first three positions.

 Possibilities: 
 If E is at position 1: E _ _ N _
    Example: ELINT? Not common ... 
    E in position 1: E_G_N, E_L_N, etc.

 Alternatively, we don't need to include E? Actually, we know E is present so we should include it to figure out its position? And also because we have limited guesses.

 Actually, we must include E in the word? No, but we can; but we should because we need to figure out where it is.

 Let me try a word like ""LEMON"": 
  L E M O N
 But we have N at the fourth position? In the word ""lemon"", the fourth letter is 'O', not 'N'. So that doesn't fit our pattern? Our pattern must have N at the fourth position.

 So the word must be: _ _ _ N _

 Now, with E present in the first three positions.

 Example words:
 Position 1: Examples: E? E at pos1: E__N_ -> E then two more letters then N then one. Words: ""eaten"", ""elton"", ""even""? But ""eaten"" has T and E? Or ""exine""? Not common.

 Position 2: _ E _ N _ : ""spent"", ""spend"", ""spent"", ""event""? But note: ""spent"": S, P, E, N, T -> N at fourth. And E at third? Actually: 
 Position 2: E? For instance: ""begin"" -> B E G I N -> N at fifth? No. 

 The positions for a word: 
 For a word with E at position 2 and N at position 4: 
 Positions: 1: ?, 2: E, 3: ?, 4: N, 5: ?

 Example: ""taken""? But ""taken"": T at1, A at2? But A is absent? So we cannot use A? Because we know A is not in the word? So ""taken"" is invalid.

 Position 3: _ _ E N _ : ""silent"": 
  - S at1, I at2, L? ... let me spell: ""silent"" -> S I L E N T -> fourth letter is E? not N? Actually: 
  S (1), I (2), L (3), E (4), N (5) -> not matching.

 We need: 
 Position 4 must be N.

 Example: ""queen"" -> QUEEN: Q (1), U (2), E (3), E (4), N (5). 
 But in our case: the fourth letter is N? So that doesn't work.

 Actually, let's list words that end with N? And have E in the first three? And avoid A, C, R.

 Also, note: we don't know about the first, second, third, and fifth letters? We know they are not C, R, A.

 So, let's pick a word that:
 - Has the 4th letter as N.
 - Includes E in one of positions 1,2,3.
 - Uses other common letters that we haven't tested.

 We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Possible words:
 ""SENT"" is four letters? So 5-letter words:

 Let me try: 
  - Position 3: E -> _ _ E N _
      Examples: token, laden, oaten? But no A? So token: T O K E N -> 
        T at1, O at2, K at3, E at4? No: 
        T (1), O (2), K (3), E (4), N (5) -> so fourth letter is E? That's not N.

 We need fourth letter to be N? So the word is ???N?.

 And E is in the first three: 
 Pattern: [letter1] [letter2] [letter3] N [letter5]

 Then E must be in letter1, letter2, or letter3.

 So:

 Pattern: E [ ] [ ] N [ ] 
 Pattern: [ ] E [ ] N [ ]
 Pattern: [ ] [ ] E N [ ]

 Now, words:

 Pattern 1: ""begin"" -> B E G I N -> but N is at fifth? Not fourth.

 Let me reconsider: we need N at fourth? So the word is:
  1: ?
  2: ?
  3: ?
  4: N
  5: ?

 And E must be at pos1,2, or3.

 Example: 
  E at pos1: ""eatin"" not a word? ""eatin"" non-standard. 
  How about ""eosin""? E O S I N -> E at1, O at2, S at3, I at4? Wait: 
      E (1), O(2), S(3), I(4), N(5) -> then fourth isn't N? That doesn't work.

 Another: ""eikon"": E I K O N -> 
    E(1), I(2), K(3), O(4), N(5) -> again, fourth is not N.

 What words end with ...N? Actually, the fourth letter being N? Then fifth letter can be anything? But the word must be 5 letters.

 Example: ""green"" -> G R E E N -> 
  G(1), R(2), E(3), E(4), N(5) -> but in this case:
  The fourth letter is E? Not N.

 How about ""thine"": T H I N E -> 
  T(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), E(5) -> 
  Wait, that's: 
    4th: N -> correct position? 
    E is at the fifth? But our feedback for ""crane"" had E at fifth and we got a dash meaning E is present but in wrong position? 

  Wait: that doesn't match because the secret word has E but not at fifth? So if the secret word were ""thine"", then E would be at fifth? But we guessed E at fifth and the feedback was '-' meaning in the word but wrong position? If E is at fifth, then that would be correct? So it would have been marked with '✓'. 

  Therefore, the secret word has E, but not at the fifth position? So ""thine"" would have E at fifth? Which would be correct? But we got '-' for E? That means the fifth letter of the secret word is not E? 

  So let's rule out E at fifth.

  Therefore, ""thine"" would be: T(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), E(5) -> for E at fifth: if secret word had E at fifth, it would be marked ✓. But we got '-', meaning E is present but not at fifth? So we are sure that fifth is not E.

  Hence, the fifth letter cannot be E? So in the secret word, E is in one of the first three.

  Thus, words like ""thine"" are invalid? Because the E at fifth would be ✓? But we got '-'.

  So, back to our pattern: 
  Secret word: _ _ _ N ? (where ? cannot be E)

  And E must be in position 1,2, or 3.

  Now, an example: ""spine"": 
    S P I N E -> 
    Position 4: N? Actually: 
        S(1), P(2), I(3), N(4), E(5) -> E at fifth? We just said fifth cannot be E? Because we got a dash for E at fifth? 

  But wait: we guessed E at fifth and got '-', meaning E is in the word but not at fifth? So spine would put E at fifth? So that would be invalid? 

  Unless the secret word does have E at fifth? Then why did we get '-'? Maybe I misunderstood? 

  Let me check the feedback: for the word ""crane"", we got E(-) meaning E is present in the secret but not in the fifth position? So the secret word does not have the fifth letter as E? 

  Hence, spine's fifth letter is E? So it would be incompatible? 

  Actually, spine: 
    Guess: S P I N E -> 
    If secret is spine, then E is at fifth? So the feedback would have been E(✓) for fifth? But we had the previous feedback for E as '-'? So that's not the secret.

  How about ""shine"": 
    S H I N ? -> but then fifth? If fifth is not E? Let me try words that end with T? 
    ""spent"": 
      S P E N T -> 
        S(1), P(2), E(3), N(4), T(5) -> 
        This fits: 
          N is at fourth? 
          E is at third? 
          And fifth letter is T? 

        So E is at third? 

        That matches: we have N at fourth and E not at fifth? 

        Also, spent doesn't use C,R,A? 

        But we haven't tested S,P,T? So let's consider.

  Another: ""token"": 
    T O K E N -> 
        T(1), O(2), K(3), E(4), N(5) -> 
        Here the fourth letter is E? That's not N? 

  Only words that have N at fourth and a non-E fifth letter?

  So pattern: _ _ _ N X, where X != E, and one of the first three must be E.

  Other words that fit: 
  ""linen"": 
    L I N E N -> 
        L(1), I(2), N(3), E(4), N(5) -> 
        So the fourth letter is E? Not N? 

  ""minim"": doesn't have E.

  ""demon"": 
    D E M O N -> 
        D(1), E(2), M(3), O(4), N(5) -> 
        So fourth letter is O? 

  Not matching.

  Let's try: 
    . E ? N ? -> so position2: E, then any letter at position3? 
    Example: ""xenon""? 
        X E N O N -> 
        X(1), E(2), N(3) ... -> then fourth letter is O? not N? 

  Actually, N is third? 

  Alternatively, try: . . E N ? 
    Example: ""spent"", ""spend"" (if allowed? wordle accepts spend), ""shend""? 

  ""spend"": 
    S(1), P(2), E(3), N(4), D(5) -> perfect: 
      N at fourth (so ✓ for N at fourth), 
      E at third (but we guessed E at fifth? so we don't know yet where E is).

  This meets our pattern? 
      The secret word must have E? So if the word is ""spend"", then E is at third.

  We need to use a word for our guess that:
    - Has the 4th letter as N? This is fixed? Because we know position4 is N? 
    - And contains E? But we don't know where? We can try different placements? 

  Since we don't want to guess the word right away? We want to maximize information.

  Alternatively, let's try to find a word that includes E and places it in a new position (not fifth) and tests multiple new letters.

  Proposed guess: ""scone"" -> but C is absent? We cannot use C? Avoid C,R,A.

  So we can't use C.

  Another: ""phone"" -> 
    P H O N E -> 
        P(1), H(2), O(3), N(4), E(5)
        Wait: since we fixed the fourth letter as N? We can put N at fourth? 
        But then E at fifth? We know the fifth letter isn't E? So why put E at fifth? 
        Also, we'll get feedback on E? But we already know E is in the word, but not at fifth? 

        For the fifth letter: we put E -> but the secret word doesn't have E there? So we would get a dash or absent? 

        Actually, we know from the feedback that the secret word has E? It will mark this E? 

        But it's better to put E somewhere else? To see if it lands in positions 1,2,3.

  Alternatively, avoid putting E at fifth? 

  So let's choose a word that:
    - Has N at the fourth position (locked).
    - Has E in position 1, 2, or 3.
    - Avoids C,R,A.
    - Uses new common letters such as S, T, L, P, etc.

  Example: 
    Position 3: E? -> so pattern: _ _ E N _

    Let's pick ""stend""? Not common? Or ""steed"": 
        S T E E D -> 
        Position 4: E! not N.

  ""steed"" would be: S(1), T(2), E(3), E(4), D(5) -> fourth is E? not good.

  ""spent"": S P E N T -> 
    Pattern: S(1), P(2), E(3), N(4), T(5) -> perfect.

  Is ""spent"" a valid word? I think so.

  Another option: ""spend"", given above.

  But note: we want to test letters? We haven't tested S or P or T? So it would be informative.

  Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn't fix E? But that might be less efficient? We need to test for E anyway? 

  Given the constraints, let's choose ""spent"".

  So our next guess: ""spent""

  The feedback will tell us:
    For S, P, E, T: 
    Specifically, we hope to learn about S, P, E, and T.

  And we confirm N is at 4th -> will receive ✓ at N.

  We guess the word: spent.

  But note: the secret might not have E at position 3? Because E could be at position 1 or 2. Our guess ""spent"" has E at 3. So if the secret word has E at position 1 or 2, then the E in this guess would be marked as '-'? 

  And we will get information about the absence/presence of S, P, T.

  Alternatively, if we don't want to commit to E in one position, we could try a word that has E in a different position? But we have to pick one.

  Another idea: use two E's? For example, ""bevel"" -> but no: because no N at fourth? And B is untested.

  But fixed pattern: we must have N at fourth? So we have no choice but to guess a word that has N at fourth.

  Therefore, let's go with ""spent"". 

  Another word that has E at position 1 and N at fourth: Eaten? But it contains A? Absent. 
  E at position 2: ""leant""? Again, A? 
  Or ""event"": 
    E V E N T -> 
        E(1), V(2), E(3), N(4), T(5) 
        But that has two E's? 

  But what does feedback do for duplicate letters? 
  For example, if the secret word is ""baton"", and we guess ""hating"", then first H is absent? and then second A is present? and so on? 

  However, to keep it simple, since ""spent"" doesn't use duplicates, let's go with it.

  So next guess: spent

  But note: the feedback for E in this guess will be:
    - If the secret word has E at position 3: then we get ✓ for E at third.
    - If the secret word has E at position 1: then since we guessed E at third? We would get a dash? 
    - Similarly, if at position 2? dash? 

  But also, we gather information about S and P?

  Also, note: T at fifth? If the secret word has T at fifth? Then we might get ✓ for T? But note: if not, we might get info that T is present or not.

  So I think ""spent"" is a good choice.

  Let me look for more words? 
    E at 1: ... maybe ""elint"" (not common)?
    E at 2: ... ""segment"" is too long? or ""lemon"" not fit? 

  Since we don't know, it's best to gather as much information as possible.

  So I choose ""spent"".

  Therefore, the guess is: spent

<guess>spent</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A are absent (marked 'x').
- N is in the correct position (4th, marked '✓').
- E is present but not in the 5th position (marked '-').

This means:
- The secret word format is `_ _ _ N _`.
- E must appear in one of positions 1, 2, or 3 (since it's not in position 5, and position 4 is N).
- C, R, A are eliminated.

For the next guess, I chose **""spent""** because:
- It locks in N at position 4.
- Places E in position 3 to test its placement.
- Introduces new common letters (S, P, T) to maximize information.
- Avoids excluded letters (C, R, A).",Guess 2: spent -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(-) E(-) N(✓) T(x),FAIL

 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover as many as possible.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C(x) -> C is not in the secret word.
 R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.
 A(x) -> A is not in the secret word.
 N(✓) -> N is in the word and in the correct position (at the 4th letter).
 E(-) -> E is in the word but in the wrong position.

 So, we know:
 - The 4th letter is N.
 - E is in the word, but not in the 5th position (since that's where we guessed it and we got a '-', meaning wrong position).
 - The secret word does not contain C, R, or A.

 Since N is at the 4th position, the word is: _ _ _ N _

 Also, E is in the word but not at the 5th position. Therefore, E must be in one of the first three position? Actually, the positions are 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 5th? No, wait: our guess was CRANE, which is:
 Position 1: C
 Position 2: R
 Position 3: A
 Position 4: N
 Position 5: E

 So the feedback tells us:
 - N is correct at position 4.
 - E is present but not at position 5. So E must be in positions 1, 2, or 3? But note: the word has 5 letters. Actually, the secret word has E in it, but not at position 5. It could be at position 1, 2, 3, or even at position 4? But position 4 is taken by N. So E must be at position 1, 2, or 3.

 However, we also know that the secret word does not contain C, R, A (because they are marked as absent). So the first three letters cannot be C, R, or A.

 Since E is in the word but not at the end, and we have the fourth letter as N, let's summarize:

 Secret word: [not C, R, A] [not C, R, A] [not C, R, A] N [some letter]

 And the word must contain E, which must be in one of positions 1, 2, 3.

 We now need to make a second guess that incorporates this information.

 Goals for the next guess:
 1. We must include E (because it is present) but not in the last position? Actually, we are not forced to avoid E in the last position? Actually, we know E is not at the 5th position in the secret word? But in our guess, we can put E anywhere? However, note that in the secret word, E is not at position 5.

 But we also know that the 4th letter is N.

 So let's list possible words:
 Pattern: _ _ _ N _

 Constraints:
 - The word has E in one of positions 1,2,3.
 - The word does not have C, R, A.

 Also, we can consider using letters that are common to gather more information about other letters.

 Alternatively, we can try to break down the positions:

 We can target positions 1,2,3, and 5.

 We know position 4 is fixed as N.

 For the next guess, we could try putting E in each of positions 1,2,3? But we don't know which one.

 Additionally, we don't know about the other letters.

 Let's try a word that has:
 - E in position 1, and includes other common letters that we haven't tested (since we only know that C,R,A are absent, we have a lot of letters left).

 Common consonants: we could try S, T, L, etc.

 But note: we have to avoid C, R, A.

 Possible second guess: ""SENTE"" -> but that has two E's? We don't know if the word allows duplicates? But the rules don't prohibit duplicates? Actually, the feedback symbols can handle duplicates? However, according to the game, duplicates are allowed? But note: in the example, there were no duplicates. But let me recall standard wordle: duplicates are allowed in the secret word? Actually, the rules might vary? But in this game, the problem says: ""After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.""

 Since the feedback does not specify rules about duplicates, I'll assume that the word can have duplicate letters? But in the absence of specific rules, I'll try to avoid duplicates to maximize information.

 However, note: if the secret word has duplicate E, then we could have two E's? But we don't know. So we should be cautious.

 But we have E present and we know it's not at position 5, so let's try placing E in position 1.

 One common word: EXIST? But that has S and T? However, we don't know if they are in the word.

 Alternatively, let's pick a word that has E in one of positions 1,2,3, and uses as many new letters as possible.

 Since we know the 4th letter is N, we can lock that in.

 Proposed structure: [E? or else] ... N and then the fifth letter.

 But also, we must avoid the letters C, R, A.

 Let me think of words with the pattern: 
 - First letter: ? (not C,R,A) and must include E somewhere in the first three positions.

 Possibilities: 
 If E is at position 1: E _ _ N _
    Example: ELINT? Not common ... 
    E in position 1: E_G_N, E_L_N, etc.

 Alternatively, we don't need to include E? Actually, we know E is present so we should include it to figure out its position? And also because we have limited guesses.

 Actually, we must include E in the word? No, but we can; but we should because we need to figure out where it is.

 Let me try a word like ""LEMON"": 
  L E M O N
 But we have N at the fourth position? In the word ""lemon"", the fourth letter is 'O', not 'N'. So that doesn't fit our pattern? Our pattern must have N at the fourth position.

 So the word must be: _ _ _ N _

 Now, with E present in the first three positions.

 Example words:
 Position 1: Examples: E? E at pos1: E__N_ -> E then two more letters then N then one. Words: ""eaten"", ""elton"", ""even""? But ""eaten"" has T and E? Or ""exine""? Not common.

 Position 2: _ E _ N _ : ""spent"", ""spend"", ""spent"", ""event""? But note: ""spent"": S, P, E, N, T -> N at fourth. And E at third? Actually: 
 Position 2: E? For instance: ""begin"" -> B E G I N -> N at fifth? No. 

 The positions for a word: 
 For a word with E at position 2 and N at position 4: 
 Positions: 1: ?, 2: E, 3: ?, 4: N, 5: ?

 Example: ""taken""? But ""taken"": T at1, A at2? But A is absent? So we cannot use A? Because we know A is not in the word? So ""taken"" is invalid.

 Position 3: _ _ E N _ : ""silent"": 
  - S at1, I at2, L? ... let me spell: ""silent"" -> S I L E N T -> fourth letter is E? not N? Actually: 
  S (1), I (2), L (3), E (4), N (5) -> not matching.

 We need: 
 Position 4 must be N.

 Example: ""queen"" -> QUEEN: Q (1), U (2), E (3), E (4), N (5). 
 But in our case: the fourth letter is N? So that doesn't work.

 Actually, let's list words that end with N? And have E in the first three? And avoid A, C, R.

 Also, note: we don't know about the first, second, third, and fifth letters? We know they are not C, R, A.

 So, let's pick a word that:
 - Has the 4th letter as N.
 - Includes E in one of positions 1,2,3.
 - Uses other common letters that we haven't tested.

 We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Possible words:
 ""SENT"" is four letters? So 5-letter words:

 Let me try: 
  - Position 3: E -> _ _ E N _
      Examples: token, laden, oaten? But no A? So token: T O K E N -> 
        T at1, O at2, K at3, E at4? No: 
        T (1), O (2), K (3), E (4), N (5) -> so fourth letter is E? That's not N.

 We need fourth letter to be N? So the word is ???N?.

 And E is in the first three: 
 Pattern: [letter1] [letter2] [letter3] N [letter5]

 Then E must be in letter1, letter2, or letter3.

 So:

 Pattern: E [ ] [ ] N [ ] 
 Pattern: [ ] E [ ] N [ ]
 Pattern: [ ] [ ] E N [ ]

 Now, words:

 Pattern 1: ""begin"" -> B E G I N -> but N is at fifth? Not fourth.

 Let me reconsider: we need N at fourth? So the word is:
  1: ?
  2: ?
  3: ?
  4: N
  5: ?

 And E must be at pos1,2, or3.

 Example: 
  E at pos1: ""eatin"" not a word? ""eatin"" non-standard. 
  How about ""eosin""? E O S I N -> E at1, O at2, S at3, I at4? Wait: 
      E (1), O(2), S(3), I(4), N(5) -> then fourth isn't N? That doesn't work.

 Another: ""eikon"": E I K O N -> 
    E(1), I(2), K(3), O(4), N(5) -> again, fourth is not N.

 What words end with ...N? Actually, the fourth letter being N? Then fifth letter can be anything? But the word must be 5 letters.

 Example: ""green"" -> G R E E N -> 
  G(1), R(2), E(3), E(4), N(5) -> but in this case:
  The fourth letter is E? Not N.

 How about ""thine"": T H I N E -> 
  T(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), E(5) -> 
  Wait, that's: 
    4th: N -> correct position? 
    E is at the fifth? But our feedback for ""crane"" had E at fifth and we got a dash meaning E is present but in wrong position? 

  Wait: that doesn't match because the secret word has E but not at fifth? So if the secret word were ""thine"", then E would be at fifth? But we guessed E at fifth and the feedback was '-' meaning in the word but wrong position? If E is at fifth, then that would be correct? So it would have been marked with '✓'. 

  Therefore, the secret word has E, but not at the fifth position? So ""thine"" would have E at fifth? Which would be correct? But we got '-' for E? That means the fifth letter of the secret word is not E? 

  So let's rule out E at fifth.

  Therefore, ""thine"" would be: T(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), E(5) -> for E at fifth: if secret word had E at fifth, it would be marked ✓. But we got '-', meaning E is present but not at fifth? So we are sure that fifth is not E.

  Hence, the fifth letter cannot be E? So in the secret word, E is in one of the first three.

  Thus, words like ""thine"" are invalid? Because the E at fifth would be ✓? But we got '-'.

  So, back to our pattern: 
  Secret word: _ _ _ N ? (where ? cannot be E)

  And E must be in position 1,2, or 3.

  Now, an example: ""spine"": 
    S P I N E -> 
    Position 4: N? Actually: 
        S(1), P(2), I(3), N(4), E(5) -> E at fifth? We just said fifth cannot be E? Because we got a dash for E at fifth? 

  But wait: we guessed E at fifth and got '-', meaning E is in the word but not at fifth? So spine would put E at fifth? So that would be invalid? 

  Unless the secret word does have E at fifth? Then why did we get '-'? Maybe I misunderstood? 

  Let me check the feedback: for the word ""crane"", we got E(-) meaning E is present in the secret but not in the fifth position? So the secret word does not have the fifth letter as E? 

  Hence, spine's fifth letter is E? So it would be incompatible? 

  Actually, spine: 
    Guess: S P I N E -> 
    If secret is spine, then E is at fifth? So the feedback would have been E(✓) for fifth? But we had the previous feedback for E as '-'? So that's not the secret.

  How about ""shine"": 
    S H I N ? -> but then fifth? If fifth is not E? Let me try words that end with T? 
    ""spent"": 
      S P E N T -> 
        S(1), P(2), E(3), N(4), T(5) -> 
        This fits: 
          N is at fourth? 
          E is at third? 
          And fifth letter is T? 

        So E is at third? 

        That matches: we have N at fourth and E not at fifth? 

        Also, spent doesn't use C,R,A? 

        But we haven't tested S,P,T? So let's consider.

  Another: ""token"": 
    T O K E N -> 
        T(1), O(2), K(3), E(4), N(5) -> 
        Here the fourth letter is E? That's not N? 

  Only words that have N at fourth and a non-E fifth letter?

  So pattern: _ _ _ N X, where X != E, and one of the first three must be E.

  Other words that fit: 
  ""linen"": 
    L I N E N -> 
        L(1), I(2), N(3), E(4), N(5) -> 
        So the fourth letter is E? Not N? 

  ""minim"": doesn't have E.

  ""demon"": 
    D E M O N -> 
        D(1), E(2), M(3), O(4), N(5) -> 
        So fourth letter is O? 

  Not matching.

  Let's try: 
    . E ? N ? -> so position2: E, then any letter at position3? 
    Example: ""xenon""? 
        X E N O N -> 
        X(1), E(2), N(3) ... -> then fourth letter is O? not N? 

  Actually, N is third? 

  Alternatively, try: . . E N ? 
    Example: ""spent"", ""spend"" (if allowed? wordle accepts spend), ""shend""? 

  ""spend"": 
    S(1), P(2), E(3), N(4), D(5) -> perfect: 
      N at fourth (so ✓ for N at fourth), 
      E at third (but we guessed E at fifth? so we don't know yet where E is).

  This meets our pattern? 
      The secret word must have E? So if the word is ""spend"", then E is at third.

  We need to use a word for our guess that:
    - Has the 4th letter as N? This is fixed? Because we know position4 is N? 
    - And contains E? But we don't know where? We can try different placements? 

  Since we don't want to guess the word right away? We want to maximize information.

  Alternatively, let's try to find a word that includes E and places it in a new position (not fifth) and tests multiple new letters.

  Proposed guess: ""scone"" -> but C is absent? We cannot use C? Avoid C,R,A.

  So we can't use C.

  Another: ""phone"" -> 
    P H O N E -> 
        P(1), H(2), O(3), N(4), E(5)
        Wait: since we fixed the fourth letter as N? We can put N at fourth? 
        But then E at fifth? We know the fifth letter isn't E? So why put E at fifth? 
        Also, we'll get feedback on E? But we already know E is in the word, but not at fifth? 

        For the fifth letter: we put E -> but the secret word doesn't have E there? So we would get a dash or absent? 

        Actually, we know from the feedback that the secret word has E? It will mark this E? 

        But it's better to put E somewhere else? To see if it lands in positions 1,2,3.

  Alternatively, avoid putting E at fifth? 

  So let's choose a word that:
    - Has N at the fourth position (locked).
    - Has E in position 1, 2, or 3.
    - Avoids C,R,A.
    - Uses new common letters such as S, T, L, P, etc.

  Example: 
    Position 3: E? -> so pattern: _ _ E N _

    Let's pick ""stend""? Not common? Or ""steed"": 
        S T E E D -> 
        Position 4: E! not N.

  ""steed"" would be: S(1), T(2), E(3), E(4), D(5) -> fourth is E? not good.

  ""spent"": S P E N T -> 
    Pattern: S(1), P(2), E(3), N(4), T(5) -> perfect.

  Is ""spent"" a valid word? I think so.

  Another option: ""spend"", given above.

  But note: we want to test letters? We haven't tested S or P or T? So it would be informative.

  Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn't fix E? But that might be less efficient? We need to test for E anyway? 

  Given the constraints, let's choose ""spent"".

  So our next guess: ""spent""

  The feedback will tell us:
    For S, P, E, T: 
    Specifically, we hope to learn about S, P, E, and T.

  And we confirm N is at 4th -> will receive ✓ at N.

  We guess the word: spent.

  But note: the secret might not have E at position 3? Because E could be at position 1 or 2. Our guess ""spent"" has E at 3. So if the secret word has E at position 1 or 2, then the E in this guess would be marked as '-'? 

  And we will get information about the absence/presence of S, P, T.

  Alternatively, if we don't want to commit to E in one position, we could try a word that has E in a different position? But we have to pick one.

  Another idea: use two E's? For example, ""bevel"" -> but no: because no N at fourth? And B is untested.

  But fixed pattern: we must have N at fourth? So we have no choice but to guess a word that has N at fourth.

  Therefore, let's go with ""spent"". 

  Another word that has E at position 1 and N at fourth: Eaten? But it contains A? Absent. 
  E at position 2: ""leant""? Again, A? 
  Or ""event"": 
    E V E N T -> 
        E(1), V(2), E(3), N(4), T(5) 
        But that has two E's? 

  But what does feedback do for duplicate letters? 
  For example, if the secret word is ""baton"", and we guess ""hating"", then first H is absent? and then second A is present? and so on? 

  However, to keep it simple, since ""spent"" doesn't use duplicates, let's go with it.

  So next guess: spent

  But note: the feedback for E in this guess will be:
    - If the secret word has E at position 3: then we get ✓ for E at third.
    - If the secret word has E at position 1: then since we guessed E at third? We would get a dash? 
    - Similarly, if at position 2? dash? 

  But also, we gather information about S and P?

  Also, note: T at fifth? If the secret word has T at fifth? Then we might get ✓ for T? But note: if not, we might get info that T is present or not.

  So I think ""spent"" is a good choice.

  Let me look for more words? 
    E at 1: ... maybe ""elint"" (not common)?
    E at 2: ... ""segment"" is too long? or ""lemon"" not fit? 

  Since we don't know, it's best to gather as much information as possible.

  So I choose ""spent"".

  Therefore, the guess is: spent

<guess>spent</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A are absent (marked 'x').
- N is in the correct position (4th, marked '✓').
- E is present but not in the 5th position (marked '-').

This means:
- The secret word format is `_ _ _ N _`.
- E must appear in one of positions 1, 2, or 3 (since it's not in position 5, and position 4 is N).
- C, R, A are eliminated.

For the next guess, I chose **""spent""** because:
- It locks in N at position 4.
- Places E in position 3 to test its placement.
- Introduces new common letters (S, P, T) to maximize information.
- Avoids excluded letters (C, R, A).

But in our guess, we can put E anywhere? However, note that in the secret word, E is not at position 5.\n\n But we also know that the 4th letter is N.\n\n So let\'s list possible words:\n Pattern: _ _ _ N _\n\n Constraints:\n - The word has E in one of positions 1,2,3.\n - The word does not have C, R, A.\n\n Also, we can consider using letters that are common to gather more information about other letters.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to break down the positions:\n\n We can target positions 1,2,3, and 5.\n\n We know position 4 is fixed as N.\n\n For the next guess, we could try putting E in each of positions 1,2,3? But we don\'t know which one.\n\n Additionally, we don\'t know about the other letters.\n\n Let\'s try a word that has:\n - E in position 1, and includes other common letters that we haven\'t tested (since we only know that C,R,A are absent, we have a lot of letters left).\n\n Common consonants: we could try S, T, L, etc.\n\n But note: we have to avoid C, R, A.\n\n Possible second guess: ""SENTE"" -> but that has two E\'s? We don\'t know if the word allows duplicates? But the rules don\'t prohibit duplicates? Actually, the feedback symbols can handle duplicates? However, according to the game, duplicates are allowed? But note: in the example, there were no duplicates. But let me recall standard wordle: duplicates are allowed in the secret word? Actually, the rules might vary? But in this game, the problem says: ""After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.""\n\n Since the feedback does not specify rules about duplicates, I\'ll assume that the word can have duplicate letters? But in the absence of specific rules, I\'ll try to avoid duplicates to maximize information.\n\n However, note: if the secret word has duplicate E, then we could have two E\'s? But we don\'t know. So we should be cautious.\n\n But we have E present and we know it\'s not at position 5, so let\'s try placing E in position 1.\n\n One common word: EXIST? But that has S and T? However, we don\'t know if they are in the word.\n\n Alternatively, let\'s pick a word that has E in one of positions 1,2,3, and uses as many new letters as possible.\n\n Since we know the 4th letter is N, we can lock that in.\n\n Proposed structure: [E? or else] ... N and then the fifth letter.\n\n But also, we must avoid the letters C, R, A.\n\n Let me think of words with the pattern: \n - First letter: ? (not C,R,A) and must include E somewhere in the first three positions.\n\n Possibilities: \n If E is at position 1: E _ _ N _\n    Example: ELINT? Not common ... \n    E in position 1: E_G_N, E_L_N, etc.\n\n Alternatively, we don\'t need to include E? Actually, we know E is present so we should include it to figure out its position? And also because we have limited guesses.\n\n Actually, we must include E in the word? No, but we can; but we should because we need to figure out where it is.\n\n Let me try a word like ""LEMON"": \n  L E M O N\n But we have N at the fourth position? In the word ""lemon"", the fourth letter is \'O\', not \'N\'. So that doesn\'t fit our pattern? Our pattern must have N at the fourth position.\n\n So the word must be: _ _ _ N _\n\n Now, with E present in the first three positions.\n\n Example words:\n Position 1: Examples: E? E at pos1: E__N_ -> E then two more letters then N then one. Words: ""eaten"", ""elton"", ""even""? But ""eaten"" has T and E? Or ""exine""? Not common.\n\n Position 2: _ E _ N _ : ""spent"", ""spend"", ""spent"", ""event""? But note: ""spent"": S, P, E, N, T -> N at fourth. And E at third? Actually: \n Position 2: E? For instance: ""begin"" -> B E G I N -> N at fifth? No. \n\n The positions for a word: \n For a word with E at position 2 and N at position 4: \n Positions: 1: ?, 2: E, 3: ?, 4: N, 5: ?\n\n Example: ""taken""? But ""taken"": T at1, A at2? But A is absent? So we cannot use A? Because we know A is not in the word? So ""taken"" is invalid.\n\n Position 3: _ _ E N _ : ""silent"": \n  - S at1, I at2, L? ... let me spell: ""silent"" -> S I L E N T -> fourth letter is E? not N? Actually: \n  S (1), I (2), L (3), E (4), N (5) -> not matching.\n\n We need: \n Position 4 must be N.\n\n Example: ""queen"" -> QUEEN: Q (1), U (2), E (3), E (4), N (5). \n But in our case: the fourth letter is N? So that doesn\'t work.\n\n Actually, let\'s list words that end with N? And have E in the first three? And avoid A, C, R.\n\n Also, note: we don\'t know about the first, second, third, and fifth letters? We know they are not C, R, A.\n\n So, let\'s pick a word that:\n - Has the 4th letter as N.\n - Includes E in one of positions 1,2,3.\n - Uses other common letters that we haven\'t tested.\n\n We haven\'t tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n Possible words:\n ""SENT"" is four letters? So 5-letter words:\n\n Let me try: \n  - Position 3: E -> _ _ E N _\n      Examples: token, laden, oaten? But no A? So token: T O K E N -> \n        T at1, O at2, K at3, E at4? No: \n        T (1), O (2), K (3), E (4), N (5) -> so fourth letter is E? That\'s not N.\n\n We need fourth letter to be N? So the word is ???N?.\n\n And E is in the first three: \n Pattern: [letter1] [letter2] [letter3] N [letter5]\n\n Then E must be in letter1, letter2, or letter3.\n\n So:\n\n Pattern: E [ ] [ ] N [ ] \n Pattern: [ ] E [ ] N [ ]\n Pattern: [ ] [ ] E N [ ]\n\n Now, words:\n\n Pattern 1: ""begin"" -> B E G I N -> but N is at fifth? Not fourth.\n\n Let me reconsider: we need N at fourth? So the word is:\n  1: ?\n  2: ?\n  3: ?\n  4: N\n  5: ?\n\n And E must be at pos1,2, or3.\n\n Example: \n  E at pos1: ""eatin"" not a word? ""eatin"" non-standard. \n  How about ""eosin""? E O S I N -> E at1, O at2, S at3, I at4? Wait: \n      E (1), O(2), S(3), I(4), N(5) -> then fourth isn\'t N? That doesn\'t work.\n\n Another: ""eikon"": E I K O N -> \n    E(1), I(2), K(3), O(4), N(5) -> again, fourth is not N.\n\n What words end with ...N? Actually, the fourth letter being N? Then fifth letter can be anything? But the word must be 5 letters.\n\n Example: ""green"" -> G R E E N -> \n  G(1), R(2), E(3), E(4), N(5) -> but in this case:\n  The fourth letter is E? Not N.\n\n How about ""thine"": T H I N E -> \n  T(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), E(5) -> \n  Wait, that\'s: \n    4th: N -> correct position? \n    E is at the fifth? But our feedback for ""crane"" had E at fifth and we got a dash meaning E is present but in wrong position? \n\n  Wait: that doesn\'t match because the secret word has E but not at fifth? So if the secret word were ""thine"", then E would be at fifth? But we guessed E at fifth and the feedback was \'-\' meaning in the word but wrong position? If E is at fifth, then that would be correct? So it would have been marked with \'✓\'. \n\n  Therefore, the secret word has E, but not at the fifth position? So ""thine"" would have E at fifth? Which would be correct? But we got \'-\' for E? That means the fifth letter of the secret word is not E? \n\n  So let\'s rule out E at fifth.\n\n  Therefore, ""thine"" would be: T(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), E(5) -> for E at fifth: if secret word had E at fifth, it would be marked ✓. But we got \'-\', meaning E is present but not at fifth? So we are sure that fifth is not E.\n\n  Hence, the fifth letter cannot be E? So in the secret word, E is in one of the first three.\n\n  Thus, words like ""thine"" are invalid? Because the E at fifth would be ✓? But we got \'-\'.\n\n  So, back to our pattern: \n  Secret word: _ _ _ N ? (where ? cannot be E)\n\n  And E must be in position 1,2, or 3.\n\n  Now, an example: ""spine"": \n    S P I N E -> \n    Position 4: N? Actually: \n        S(1), P(2), I(3), N(4), E(5) -> E at fifth? We just said fifth cannot be E? Because we got a dash for E at fifth? \n\n  But wait: we guessed E at fifth and got \'-\', meaning E is in the word but not at fifth? So spine would put E at fifth? So that would be invalid? \n\n  Unless the secret word does have E at fifth? Then why did we get \'-\'? Maybe I misunderstood? \n\n  Let me check the feedback: for the word ""crane"", we got E(-) meaning E is present in the secret but not in the fifth position? So the secret word does not have the fifth letter as E? \n\n  Hence, spine\'s fifth letter is E? So it would be incompatible? \n\n  Actually, spine: \n    Guess: S P I N E -> \n    If secret is spine, then E is at fifth? So the feedback would have been E(✓) for fifth? But we had the previous feedback for E as \'-\'? So that\'s not the secret.\n\n  How about ""shine"": \n    S H I N ? -> but then fifth? If fifth is not E? Let me try words that end with T? \n    ""spent"": \n      S P E N T -> \n        S(1), P(2), E(3), N(4), T(5) -> \n        This fits: \n          N is at fourth? \n          E is at third? \n          And fifth letter is T? \n\n        So E is at third? \n\n        That matches: we have N at fourth and E not at fifth? \n\n        Also, spent doesn\'t use C,R,A? \n\n        But we haven\'t tested S,P,T? So let\'s consider.\n\n  Another: ""token"": \n    T O K E N -> \n        T(1), O(2), K(3), E(4), N(5) -> \n        Here the fourth letter is E? That\'s not N? \n\n  Only words that have N at fourth and a non-E fifth letter?\n\n  So pattern: _ _ _ N X, where X != E, and one of the first three must be E.\n\n  Other words that fit: \n  ""linen"": \n    L I N E N -> \n        L(1), I(2), N(3), E(4), N(5) -> \n        So the fourth letter is E? Not N? \n\n  ""minim"": doesn\'t have E.\n\n  ""demon"": \n    D E M O N -> \n        D(1), E(2), M(3), O(4), N(5) -> \n        So fourth letter is O? \n\n  Not matching.\n\n  Let\'s try: \n    . E ? N ? -> so position2: E, then any letter at position3? \n    Example: ""xenon""? \n        X E N O N -> \n        X(1), E(2), N(3) ... -> then fourth letter is O? not N? \n\n  Actually, N is third? \n\n  Alternatively, try: . . E N ? \n    Example: ""spent"", ""spend"" (if allowed? wordle accepts spend), ""shend""? \n\n  ""spend"": \n    S(1), P(2), E(3), N(4), D(5) -> perfect: \n      N at fourth (so ✓ for N at fourth), \n      E at third (but we guessed E at fifth? so we don\'t know yet where E is).\n\n  This meets our pattern? \n      The secret word must have E? So if the word is ""spend"", then E is at third.\n\n  We need to use a word for our guess that:\n    - Has the 4th letter as N? This is fixed? Because we know position4 is N? \n    - And contains E? But we don\'t know where? We can try different placements? \n\n  Since we don\'t want to guess the word right away? We want to maximize information.\n\n  Alternatively, let\'s try to find a word that includes E and places it in a new position (not fifth) and tests multiple new letters.\n\n  Proposed guess: ""scone"" -> but C is absent? We cannot use C? Avoid C,R,A.\n\n  So we can\'t use C.\n\n  Another: ""phone"" -> \n    P H O N E -> \n        P(1), H(2), O(3), N(4), E(5)\n        Wait: since we fixed the fourth letter as N? We can put N at fourth? \n        But then E at fifth? We know the fifth letter isn\'t E? So why put E at fifth? \n        Also, we\'ll get feedback on E? But we already know E is in the word, but not at fifth? \n\n        For the fifth letter: we put E -> but the secret word doesn\'t have E there? So we would get a dash or absent? \n\n        Actually, we know from the feedback that the secret word has E? It will mark this E? \n\n        But it\'s better to put E somewhere else? To see if it lands in positions 1,2,3.\n\n  Alternatively, avoid putting E at fifth? \n\n  So let\'s choose a word that:\n    - Has N at the fourth position (locked).\n    - Has E in position 1, 2, or 3.\n    - Avoids C,R,A.\n    - Uses new common letters such as S, T, L, P, etc.\n\n  Example: \n    Position 3: E? -> so pattern: _ _ E N _\n\n    Let\'s pick ""stend""? Not common? Or ""steed"": \n        S T E E D -> \n        Position 4: E! not N.\n\n  ""steed"" would be: S(1), T(2), E(3), E(4), D(5) -> fourth is E? not good.\n\n  ""spent"": S P E N T -> \n    Pattern: S(1), P(2), E(3), N(4), T(5) -> perfect.\n\n  Is ""spent"" a valid word? I think so.\n\n  Another option: ""spend"", given above.\n\n  But note: we want to test letters? We haven\'t tested S or P or T? So it would be informative.\n\n  Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn\'t fix E? But that might be less efficient? We need to test for E anyway? \n\n  Given the constraints, let\'s choose ""spent"".\n\n  So our next guess: ""spent""\n\n  The feedback will tell us:\n    For S, P, E, T: \n    Specifically, we hope to learn about S, P, E, and T.\n\n  And we confirm N is at 4th -> will receive ✓ at N.\n\n  We guess the word: spent.\n\n  But note: the secret might not have E at position 3? Because E could be at position 1 or 2. Our guess ""spent"" has E at 3. So if the secret word has E at position 1 or 2, then the E in this guess would be marked as \'-\'? \n\n  And we will get information about the absence/presence of S, P, T.\n\n  Alternatively, if we don\'t want to commit to E in one position, we could try a word that has E in a different position? But we have to pick one.\n\n  Another idea: use two E\'s? For example, ""bevel"" -> but no: because no N at fourth? And B is untested.\n\n  But fixed pattern: we must have N at fourth? So we have no choice but to guess a word that has N at fourth.\n\n  Therefore, let\'s go with ""spent"". \n\n  Another word that has E at position 1 and N at fourth: Eaten? But it contains A? Absent. \n  E at position 2: ""leant""? Again, A? \n  Or ""event"": \n    E V E N T -> \n        E(1), V(2), E(3), N(4), T(5) \n        But that has two E\'s? \n\n  But what does feedback do for duplicate letters? \n  For example, if the secret word is ""baton"", and we guess ""hating"", then first H is absent? and then second A is present? and so on? \n\n  However, to keep it simple, since ""spent"" doesn\'t use duplicates, let\'s go with it.\n\n  So next guess: spent\n\n  But note: the feedback for E in this guess will be:\n    - If the secret word has E at position 3: then we get ✓ for E at third.\n    - If the secret word has E at position 1: then since we guessed E at third? We would get a dash? \n    - Similarly, if at position 2? dash? \n\n  But also, we gather information about S and P?\n\n  Also, note: T at fifth? If the secret word has T at fifth? Then we might get ✓ for T? But note: if not, we might get info that T is present or not.\n\n  So I think ""spent"" is a good choice.\n\n  Let me look for more words? \n    E at 1: ... maybe ""elint"" (not common)?\n    E at 2: ... ""segment"" is too long? or ""lemon"" not fit? \n\n  Since we don\'t know, it\'s best to gather as much information as possible.\n\n  So I choose ""spent"".\n\n  Therefore, the guess is: spent\n\n<guess>spent</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, A are absent (marked \'x\').\n- N is in the correct position (4th, marked \'✓\').\n- E is present but not in the 5th position (marked \'-\').\n\nThis means:\n- The secret word format is `_ _ _ N _`.\n- E must appear in one of positions 1, 2, or 3 (since it\'s not in position 5, and position 4 is N).\n- C, R, A are eliminated.\n\nFor the next guess, I chose **""spent""** because:\n- It locks in N at position 4.\n- Places E in position 3 to test its placement.\n- Introduces new common letters (S, P, T) to maximize information.\n- Avoids excluded letters (C, R, A).\n\n<guess>spent</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(-)\nGuess 2: spent -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(-) E(-) N(✓) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane"" → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(-)
Second guess: ""spent"" → S(x), P(-), E(-), N(✓), T(x)

Summary of known information:
- The 4th letter is N (confirmed from both guesses).
- E is in the word but not at position 5 (from first guess). Moreover, from the second guess, E was guessed at position 3 and got '-' meaning it's not at position 3 (but still in the word).
- P was guessed at position 2 and got '-' meaning P is in the word but not at position 2.
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, S, T (all marked 'x').
- Also, from ""spent"": S(x), T(x) → so S and T are absent.

Therefore, eliminated letters: A, C, R, S, T.

Now, the secret word structure: _ _ _ N _
We know E is in the word and must be in position 1 or 2? Because position 4 is N and we know E is not in position 3 (from second guess) or 5 (from first guess). So E must be in position 1 or 2.

Also, P is in the word but not at position 2 (from the second guess: P at position 2 marked as '-').

So P is present and could be in positions 1, 3, or 5? But note the word has positions: 1, 2, 3, 4=N, 5.

We don't know which positions P can be? Only that it's not at position 2.

Now, let's list available letters:
Alphabet except: A, C, R, S, T. So available: B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we know E and P are present. Also, N is at position 4? That's fixed.

So secret word: [E must be here at 1 or 2] and P must be somewhere not position 2? And we have position 3 and 5 to fill? Along with position 1 or 2? Depending on E.

Since we are limited to 6 guesses, we need to make an informed third guess.

Goals for guess 3:
- Narrow down the position of E (is it at 1 or 2?).
- Find the position of P? But P could be at 1, 3, 5?
- Test other common letters.

But note: we know P is present? So why not use it? And E is also present? But we cannot put them in positions we know they can't be? So avoid E at positions 3 and 5? And avoid P at position 2.

Let me structure possible patterns:

Case 1: E at position 1
Then the word: E _ _ N _
But the second letter is not P? Since P is not allowed at position 2? But P could be at position 1? But if E is at position 1? Then P cannot be at 1? So P must be at position 3 or 5.

Case 2: E at position 2
Then the word: _ E _ N _
But note: position 2 is E? Then P cannot be at position 2? But that's okay? P would be at position 1, 3, or 5? But also, E is occupying position 2? So P cannot be at 2? Which is already covered.

So we must design a word that:
- Includes E and P (since they are present).
- E is placed in either position 1 or 2? Because we haven't tested those? But note: we already know E is not at 3 or 5? So we must test either position 1 or 2? But preferably both? But we can only put E in one position per guess.

However, we can make a guess that places E in position 1? Then we'll know if E is at 1? If not? Then it must be at 2? Because those are the only possibilities left? So we can deduce without testing position 2.

But we don't need to? Actually, we can try to put E in position 1? And see the feedback.

Similarly, we can also put P in position 3 or 5? And see? And then we hope to lock down E's position? And also P's position? Plus test new letters.

So let me try:

If we put E at position 1: then guess E ? ? N ?

But we must choose ? to be valid words? Also, avoid the eliminated letters? And we know P is present? So we should place P? Or can defer? But if we don't put P? Then we won't get feedback on its position? But we can? Actually, we don't have to put both E and P? But we know they are present? It's best to put them to learn about their positions? Otherwise, the guess might not be informative enough.

So:

Pattern if E at 1: E _ _ N _ 
But we know P is somewhere? And we don't have used P? So we must put P? How about E at 1, and P at 3? Or P at 5? 

Example word: ""epend"" -> not common? 
Another: ""elfin""? But that doesn't have the fourth as N? 
Or ""eveen""? Not valid.

Valid words:
E P ? N ? -> but then positions: 
Position1: E, position2: P? But wait: P cannot be at position 2? Because from the second guess? P placed at position 2 was marked '-' meaning it is not at that position? So P cannot be at position 2.

Therefore, we cannot put P at 2? So if we set E at 1, then the second letter cannot be P? So we can put P at 3 or 5? 

But what about position 3: P? Or position 5: P?

Let me think of words: 
- E at 1, P at 3: E _ P N _ 
  Example: ""empty""? 
    E M P T Y -> 
    But T is absent? So we cannot use T? Eliminated.

  Also: ""emple"" -> not common.

- E at 1, P at 5: E ? ? N P 
  Example: ""eaglep""? Not valid? Or ""eightp""? 
  More common: ""econp""? No.

But consider: E _ _ N P 
   letters: we need two letters? 
   Example: ""elintp""? No.

Actually, hard to find a word? Since N at fourth and P at fifth? And E at first? Then two letters? 
Such as ""eigen"": E I G E N -> but then fifth is N? not P? 
""ewinp""? Not common? 
""elump""? N? 
Not many options? 

Alternatively, if E at position 2: 
Pattern: _ E _ N _ 
And we can put P at position 1 or 3 or 5? 
But avoid position 2? Which we are putting E? 

So: 
- P at 1: P E _ N _ 
  Example: ""pengo""? But has G? 
  ""penup""? 
  Or: ""pekun""? 

- P at 3: _ E P N _ 
  Example: ""depnd""? 
  ""we"" are missing? 

Given the eliminated letters? We have to choose from: B,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? But we know E and P are already used? So the remaining must be from others? 

But note: we don't have to exhaust? We can choose a word that tests E at position 1 and introduces other letters? And P separately? 

But let me consider: we plan to put E at 1? Or at 2? Both possibilities? So we can design a word that covers both? Or not?

To maximize information? Let me pick the case that covers more? And tests other letters? 

Alternatively, maybe we don't need to try E? Because if we try E at 1? Then if E is at 2? We'll know? Or vice versa? So by trying E at 1? We can deduce: if we get '✓' for position1? Then E at1? Otherwise? E must be at position 2? Because we know it's not anywhere else? 

So we can do:

Guess: ""e"" at position 1, and then for position 3? We know it's not E? So we put a new letter? And then position 5? 

We also have to include P? Since we have to place P? But we don't know where P is? But we can put it at position 3? For example? 

Word: ""e"" at1, ""l"" at2, ""p"" at3, ""n"" at4, ""y"" at5: ""elpny"" → not a valid word? 

Valid words: 
Let me think: ""embed"" → E M B E D → but it has two E? And the pattern doesn't have N at 4th? 

""elbow""? Not ending with N? 

""Egged""? Not valid? 

Perhaps ""expan"" → but X,P,A? A is eliminated? 

""elven"" → E L V E N → 
    Pattern: E(1), L(2), V(3), E(4), N(5) →
    4th is E? not N? 

I need a word with E at1 and N at4? 

How about ""eatin""? Not valid? 
""edwin""? Proper noun? 

Valid English 5-letter words? 

Actually, the word often used? ""begin""? But G? 
But pattern: B E G I N → N at fifth? 

We need N at fourth? 

""E"" at first and N at fourth? Then the fifth letter? Let's be B? ""E"" not common? 

""earthing"" not 5 letters? 

Perhaps ""eikon""? But O is at fourth? 

I think there are not many common words with E at first and N at fourth? 

So maybe we shift to putting E at position 2?

If E at position 2: 
Pattern: _ E _ N _

Guess the first letter? And third? And fifth? 

We know P must be present? So we can put P at position 1 or 3 or 5? 

Example: 
- If P at position 1: P E ? N ?
  Example: ""pen"" related? 
      ""penknife"" too long? 
      ""penne"" → P E N N E → 
        Positions: 
          1: P, 2: E, 3: N? But we already have N at fourth? And guess has N at position 3 and 4? 
        But the secret has N only at fourth? So position 3? We don't know? 
        And the secret has E at position 2? So for ""penne"": 
          P at1: we don't know?
          E at2: might be ✓? 
          N at3: but in the secret? We don't know? If the secret does not have N at3? We'll get feedback? 
        But also, we have eliminated T? So ""penne"" is allowed? Letters: P,E,N,N,E? Not standard? But ""penne"" is a word? 5-letter? P-E-N-N-E.

        However, note: we have double N? But N at position 3 and 4? 
        Our feedback for N in ""crane"" and ""spent"" we had N at 4th? In ""penne"", we put:
          P at1: ?
          E at2: if the secret has E at2? Then ✓? 
          N at3: might be absent? Or might be present?
          N at4: ✓? 
          E at5: but secret has E at2? And we already know E is present? But if the secret does not have E at5? We will get dash for E at5? But we also have E at2? Which is correct? 
        This might be messy? 

  Alternatively, ""peony"" → P E O N Y -> 
      Pattern: P(1), E(2), O(3), N(4), Y(5)
      This is a common word. 
      And it doesn't use eliminated letters? 

  Also: 
      Position1: P → is that possible? Previously we only know P is present? Not its position? 
      Position2: E → if the secret has E at2? Then ✓? 
      Position3: O → we are guessing?
      Position4: N → ✓? 
      Position5: Y → new letter? 

  So this guess would be informative? 

  Why not? 

  But what if E is not at position 2? But at position 1? Then this guess won't work? Because we are having E at position 2? 

  But we have two cases:

  If we choose ""peony"", then:
    If the secret has E at position 1 (which is possible? and we don't know yet)? 
        then feedback on P? 
          P at1: would be a different letter? So feedback for P at1? Might be ✗ or dash? 
        E at2: even though E is present? But not at2? So would be dash? 

    But then we deduce? Because if E is at1, then it will show? 
    Or if at2, then it will be ✓? 

  Similarly for P? 

  Alternatively, if E is at position 1? Then we make a guess that doesn't test E at2? 

  But we need to know? 

  Also, we have only 6 guesses? We are on guess 3? 

  If we put E in position 1 in our guess? And the secret has E at position 1? We get ✓? And if not? Then we know it must be at position 2? 

  But as per? We are conflicted by the lack of common words with E at1 and N at4? 

  Let's search for a valid word that has:
    E at1? and N at4? and fifth letter not S,T,C,R,A? And includes P? 

  For example, ""E"" at1, ""P"" say at5? Then between: two letters? 

  Word: ""eppen""? Not common? 
  ""eplop""? No. 

  Valid English words: 
  ""edged"" —> doesn't have N? 
  ""eggup"" —> 
  Maybe ""empohen""? Not 5. 

  Considering scarcity, if I cannot find for E at1? Then maybe I put E at position 2? And also put P? In either position 1 or 3 or 5? 

  So let's go with a word that has E at2? And P at1? Also common other letters? 

  ""peony"" is a valid word: P E O N Y

  Why not use ""peony"" for guess 3? 

  We will learn:
    - If P at1 is ✓? Then P is at1? If not? Might be dash if in secret but not that position? 

    Also: about E at2? 
        If ✓? Then E is at2? 
        If not? Then since E must be in the word? And not at3 or5? Then it must be at1? 

        But then we'll see feedback? 

    Additionally, O and Y? 

  Also, it doesn't use any eliminated letter? 

  Therefore, let's guess: ""peony""

<guess>peony</guess> 
But wait: what if the secret word has E at position 1? Then we'll see:

  P (1): dash? Or absent? 
  But we know P is present? So it will be dash? 
  Then E at2? The secret has E at1? Not at2? So E not at2? Dash? 
  Then we know E must be at1? But we didn't test position1? 

  Then for the next guess? We can shift.

  So it is acceptable? 

  For this guess: 
    Even if we don't get E at2? We deduce from the feedback? 

  So I think ""peony"" is a good word.

  Alternatively, if we want to cover both? We can try a word that has E in a new position? But no? 

  So let's go with ""peony"".

  Also, note: we have to include N at4? Obviously? So ""peony"" has N at fourth? 

  Therefore: next guess: ""peony""
</think>
### Feedback Analysis from Previous Guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(-)  
  - N is confirmed at position 4.  
  - E is in the secret word but not at position 5.  
- **Guess 2 (""spent"")**: S(x), P(-), E(-), N(✓), T(x)  
  - P is in the secret word but not at position 2.  
  - E is not at position 3 (since it was marked as ""-"", meaning present but wrong position).  
- **Key Insights**:  
  - Secret word format: `_ _ _ N _`.  
  - E must be in position 1 or 2 (not 3, 4, or 5).  
  - P is present but not at position 2.  
  - Eliminated letters: A, C, R, S, T.  
  - Valid letters include: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (besides confirmed E and P).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Goal**: Determine E's position (1 or 2) and P's location (not position 2). Use a word that places E correctly or provides positional feedback on both letters.  
- **Chosen Word: ""peony""**  
  - P at position 1: Tests if P is at the start.  
  - E at position 2: Tests if E is in this slot.  
  - O and Y: New letters to gather feedback.  
  - Fits the `_ E _ N _` pattern and avoids eliminated letters.  
- **Why ""peony""?**  
  - Tests E at position 2: If correct, we get ""✓"" for E; if not, we know E must be at position 1 (since it's not elsewhere).  
  - Tests P at position 1: We know P is present, so feedback will reveal if it's at position 1 or must be elsewhere (e.g., position 3 or 5).  
  - Uses common letters (O, Y) to maximize information gain.  

If E is not at position 2, the feedback will narrow E to position 1, and P's feedback will help pin its location. 

<guess>peony</guess>",peony,"We are given feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane"" → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(-)
Second guess: ""spent"" → S(x), P(-), E(-), N(✓), T(x)

Summary of known information:
- The 4th letter is N (confirmed from both guesses).
- E is in the word but not at position 5 (from first guess). Moreover, from the second guess, E was guessed at position 3 and got '-' meaning it's not at position 3 (but still in the word).
- P was guessed at position 2 and got '-' meaning P is in the word but not at position 2.
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, S, T (all marked 'x').
- Also, from ""spent"": S(x), T(x) → so S and T are absent.

Therefore, eliminated letters: A, C, R, S, T.

Now, the secret word structure: _ _ _ N _
We know E is in the word and must be in position 1 or 2? Because position 4 is N and we know E is not in position 3 (from second guess) or 5 (from first guess). So E must be in position 1 or 2.

Also, P is in the word but not at position 2 (from the second guess: P at position 2 marked as '-').

So P is present and could be in positions 1, 3, or 5? But note the word has positions: 1, 2, 3, 4=N, 5.

We don't know which positions P can be? Only that it's not at position 2.

Now, let's list available letters:
Alphabet except: A, C, R, S, T. So available: B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we know E and P are present. Also, N is at position 4? That's fixed.

So secret word: [E must be here at 1 or 2] and P must be somewhere not position 2? And we have position 3 and 5 to fill? Along with position 1 or 2? Depending on E.

Since we are limited to 6 guesses, we need to make an informed third guess.

Goals for guess 3:
- Narrow down the position of E (is it at 1 or 2?).
- Find the position of P? But P could be at 1, 3, 5?
- Test other common letters.

But note: we know P is present? So why not use it? And E is also present? But we cannot put them in positions we know they can't be? So avoid E at positions 3 and 5? And avoid P at position 2.

Let me structure possible patterns:

Case 1: E at position 1
Then the word: E _ _ N _
But the second letter is not P? Since P is not allowed at position 2? But P could be at position 1? But if E is at position 1? Then P cannot be at 1? So P must be at position 3 or 5.

Case 2: E at position 2
Then the word: _ E _ N _
But note: position 2 is E? Then P cannot be at position 2? But that's okay? P would be at position 1, 3, or 5? But also, E is occupying position 2? So P cannot be at 2? Which is already covered.

So we must design a word that:
- Includes E and P (since they are present).
- E is placed in either position 1 or 2? Because we haven't tested those? But note: we already know E is not at 3 or 5? So we must test either position 1 or 2? But preferably both? But we can only put E in one position per guess.

However, we can make a guess that places E in position 1? Then we'll know if E is at 1? If not? Then it must be at 2? Because those are the only possibilities left? So we can deduce without testing position 2.

But we don't need to? Actually, we can try to put E in position 1? And see the feedback.

Similarly, we can also put P in position 3 or 5? And see? And then we hope to lock down E's position? And also P's position? Plus test new letters.

So let me try:

If we put E at position 1: then guess E ? ? N ?

But we must choose ? to be valid words? Also, avoid the eliminated letters? And we know P is present? So we should place P? Or can defer? But if we don't put P? Then we won't get feedback on its position? But we can? Actually, we don't have to put both E and P? But we know they are present? It's best to put them to learn about their positions? Otherwise, the guess might not be informative enough.

So:

Pattern if E at 1: E _ _ N _ 
But we know P is somewhere? And we don't have used P? So we must put P? How about E at 1, and P at 3? Or P at 5? 

Example word: ""epend"" -> not common? 
Another: ""elfin""? But that doesn't have the fourth as N? 
Or ""eveen""? Not valid.

Valid words:
E P ? N ? -> but then positions: 
Position1: E, position2: P? But wait: P cannot be at position 2? Because from the second guess? P placed at position 2 was marked '-' meaning it is not at that position? So P cannot be at position 2.

Therefore, we cannot put P at 2? So if we set E at 1, then the second letter cannot be P? So we can put P at 3 or 5? 

But what about position 3: P? Or position 5: P?

Let me think of words: 
- E at 1, P at 3: E _ P N _ 
  Example: ""empty""? 
    E M P T Y -> 
    But T is absent? So we cannot use T? Eliminated.

  Also: ""emple"" -> not common.

- E at 1, P at 5: E ? ? N P 
  Example: ""eaglep""? Not valid? Or ""eightp""? 
  More common: ""econp""? No.

But consider: E _ _ N P 
   letters: we need two letters? 
   Example: ""elintp""? No.

Actually, hard to find a word? Since N at fourth and P at fifth? And E at first? Then two letters? 
Such as ""eigen"": E I G E N -> but then fifth is N? not P? 
""ewinp""? Not common? 
""elump""? N? 
Not many options? 

Alternatively, if E at position 2: 
Pattern: _ E _ N _ 
And we can put P at position 1 or 3 or 5? 
But avoid position 2? Which we are putting E? 

So: 
- P at 1: P E _ N _ 
  Example: ""pengo""? But has G? 
  ""penup""? 
  Or: ""pekun""? 

- P at 3: _ E P N _ 
  Example: ""depnd""? 
  ""we"" are missing? 

Given the eliminated letters? We have to choose from: B,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? But we know E and P are already used? So the remaining must be from others? 

But note: we don't have to exhaust? We can choose a word that tests E at position 1 and introduces other letters? And P separately? 

But let me consider: we plan to put E at 1? Or at 2? Both possibilities? So we can design a word that covers both? Or not?

To maximize information? Let me pick the case that covers more? And tests other letters? 

Alternatively, maybe we don't need to try E? Because if we try E at 1? Then if E is at 2? We'll know? Or vice versa? So by trying E at 1? We can deduce: if we get '✓' for position1? Then E at1? Otherwise? E must be at position 2? Because we know it's not anywhere else? 

So we can do:

Guess: ""e"" at position 1, and then for position 3? We know it's not E? So we put a new letter? And then position 5? 

We also have to include P? Since we have to place P? But we don't know where P is? But we can put it at position 3? For example? 

Word: ""e"" at1, ""l"" at2, ""p"" at3, ""n"" at4, ""y"" at5: ""elpny"" → not a valid word? 

Valid words: 
Let me think: ""embed"" → E M B E D → but it has two E? And the pattern doesn't have N at 4th? 

""elbow""? Not ending with N? 

""Egged""? Not valid? 

Perhaps ""expan"" → but X,P,A? A is eliminated? 

""elven"" → E L V E N → 
    Pattern: E(1), L(2), V(3), E(4), N(5) →
    4th is E? not N? 

I need a word with E at1 and N at4? 

How about ""eatin""? Not valid? 
""edwin""? Proper noun? 

Valid English 5-letter words? 

Actually, the word often used? ""begin""? But G? 
But pattern: B E G I N → N at fifth? 

We need N at fourth? 

""E"" at first and N at fourth? Then the fifth letter? Let's be B? ""E"" not common? 

""earthing"" not 5 letters? 

Perhaps ""eikon""? But O is at fourth? 

I think there are not many common words with E at first and N at fourth? 

So maybe we shift to putting E at position 2?

If E at position 2: 
Pattern: _ E _ N _

Guess the first letter? And third? And fifth? 

We know P must be present? So we can put P at position 1 or 3 or 5? 

Example: 
- If P at position 1: P E ? N ?
  Example: ""pen"" related? 
      ""penknife"" too long? 
      ""penne"" → P E N N E → 
        Positions: 
          1: P, 2: E, 3: N? But we already have N at fourth? And guess has N at position 3 and 4? 
        But the secret has N only at fourth? So position 3? We don't know? 
        And the secret has E at position 2? So for ""penne"": 
          P at1: we don't know?
          E at2: might be ✓? 
          N at3: but in the secret? We don't know? If the secret does not have N at3? We'll get feedback? 
        But also, we have eliminated T? So ""penne"" is allowed? Letters: P,E,N,N,E? Not standard? But ""penne"" is a word? 5-letter? P-E-N-N-E.

        However, note: we have double N? But N at position 3 and 4? 
        Our feedback for N in ""crane"" and ""spent"" we had N at 4th? In ""penne"", we put:
          P at1: ?
          E at2: if the secret has E at2? Then ✓? 
          N at3: might be absent? Or might be present?
          N at4: ✓? 
          E at5: but secret has E at2? And we already know E is present? But if the secret does not have E at5? We will get dash for E at5? But we also have E at2? Which is correct? 
        This might be messy? 

  Alternatively, ""peony"" → P E O N Y -> 
      Pattern: P(1), E(2), O(3), N(4), Y(5)
      This is a common word. 
      And it doesn't use eliminated letters? 

  Also: 
      Position1: P → is that possible? Previously we only know P is present? Not its position? 
      Position2: E → if the secret has E at2? Then ✓? 
      Position3: O → we are guessing?
      Position4: N → ✓? 
      Position5: Y → new letter? 

  So this guess would be informative? 

  Why not? 

  But what if E is not at position 2? But at position 1? Then this guess won't work? Because we are having E at position 2? 

  But we have two cases:

  If we choose ""peony"", then:
    If the secret has E at position 1 (which is possible? and we don't know yet)? 
        then feedback on P? 
          P at1: would be a different letter? So feedback for P at1? Might be ✗ or dash? 
        E at2: even though E is present? But not at2? So would be dash? 

    But then we deduce? Because if E is at1, then it will show? 
    Or if at2, then it will be ✓? 

  Similarly for P? 

  Alternatively, if E is at position 1? Then we make a guess that doesn't test E at2? 

  But we need to know? 

  Also, we have only 6 guesses? We are on guess 3? 

  If we put E in position 1 in our guess? And the secret has E at position 1? We get ✓? And if not? Then we know it must be at position 2? 

  But as per? We are conflicted by the lack of common words with E at1 and N at4? 

  Let's search for a valid word that has:
    E at1? and N at4? and fifth letter not S,T,C,R,A? And includes P? 

  For example, ""E"" at1, ""P"" say at5? Then between: two letters? 

  Word: ""eppen""? Not common? 
  ""eplop""? No. 

  Valid English words: 
  ""edged"" —> doesn't have N? 
  ""eggup"" —> 
  Maybe ""empohen""? Not 5. 

  Considering scarcity, if I cannot find for E at1? Then maybe I put E at position 2? And also put P? In either position 1 or 3 or 5? 

  So let's go with a word that has E at2? And P at1? Also common other letters? 

  ""peony"" is a valid word: P E O N Y

  Why not use ""peony"" for guess 3? 

  We will learn:
    - If P at1 is ✓? Then P is at1? If not? Might be dash if in secret but not that position? 

    Also: about E at2? 
        If ✓? Then E is at2? 
        If not? Then since E must be in the word? And not at3 or5? Then it must be at1? 

        But then we'll see feedback? 

    Additionally, O and Y? 

  Also, it doesn't use any eliminated letter? 

  Therefore, let's guess: ""peony""

<guess>peony</guess> 
But wait: what if the secret word has E at position 1? Then we'll see:

  P (1): dash? Or absent? 
  But we know P is present? So it will be dash? 
  Then E at2? The secret has E at1? Not at2? So E not at2? Dash? 
  Then we know E must be at1? But we didn't test position1? 

  Then for the next guess? We can shift.

  So it is acceptable? 

  For this guess: 
    Even if we don't get E at2? We deduce from the feedback? 

  So I think ""peony"" is a good word.

  Alternatively, if we want to cover both? We can try a word that has E in a new position? But no? 

  So let's go with ""peony"".

  Also, note: we have to include N at4? Obviously? So ""peony"" has N at fourth? 

  Therefore: next guess: ""peony""### Feedback Analysis from Previous Guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(-)  
  - N is confirmed at position 4.  
  - E is in the secret word but not at position 5.  
- **Guess 2 (""spent"")**: S(x), P(-), E(-), N(✓), T(x)  
  - P is in the secret word but not at position 2.  
  - E is not at position 3 (since it was marked as ""-"", meaning present but wrong position).  
- **Key Insights**:  
  - Secret word format: `_ _ _ N _`.  
  - E must be in position 1 or 2 (not 3, 4, or 5).  
  - P is present but not at position 2.  
  - Eliminated letters: A, C, R, S, T.  
  - Valid letters include: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (besides confirmed E and P).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Goal**: Determine E's position (1 or 2) and P's location (not position 2). Use a word that places E correctly or provides positional feedback on both letters.  
- **Chosen Word: ""peony""**  
  - P at position 1: Tests if P is at the start.  
  - E at position 2: Tests if E is in this slot.  
  - O and Y: New letters to gather feedback.  
  - Fits the `_ E _ N _` pattern and avoids eliminated letters.  
- **Why ""peony""?**  
  - Tests E at position 2: If correct, we get ""✓"" for E; if not, we know E must be at position 1 (since it's not elsewhere).  
  - Tests P at position 1: We know P is present, so feedback will reveal if it's at position 1 or must be elsewhere (e.g., position 3 or 5).  
  - Uses common letters (O, Y) to maximize information gain.  

If E is not at position 2, the feedback will narrow E to position 1, and P's feedback will help pin its location.",Guess 3: peony -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) E(✓) O(x) N(✓) Y(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,PENNY,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since there is no prior feedback, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover as many as possible.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C(x) -> C is not in the secret word.
 R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.
 A(x) -> A is not in the secret word.
 N(✓) -> N is in the word and in the correct position (at the 4th letter).
 E(-) -> E is in the word but in the wrong position.

 So, we know:
 - The 4th letter is N.
 - E is in the word, but not in the 5th position (since that's where we guessed it and we got a '-', meaning wrong position).
 - The secret word does not contain C, R, or A.

 Since N is at the 4th position, the word is: _ _ _ N _

 Also, E is in the word but not at the 5th position. Therefore, E must be in one of the first three position? Actually, the positions are 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 5th? No, wait: our guess was CRANE, which is:
 Position 1: C
 Position 2: R
 Position 3: A
 Position 4: N
 Position 5: E

 So the feedback tells us:
 - N is correct at position 4.
 - E is present but not at position 5. So E must be in positions 1, 2, or 3? But note: the word has 5 letters. Actually, the secret word has E in it, but not at position 5. It could be at position 1, 2, 3, or even at position 4? But position 4 is taken by N. So E must be at position 1, 2, or 3.

 However, we also know that the secret word does not contain C, R, A (because they are marked as absent). So the first three letters cannot be C, R, or A.

 Since E is in the word but not at the end, and we have the fourth letter as N, let's summarize:

 Secret word: [not C, R, A] [not C, R, A] [not C, R, A] N [some letter]

 And the word must contain E, which must be in one of positions 1, 2, 3.

 We now need to make a second guess that incorporates this information.

 Goals for the next guess:
 1. We must include E (because it is present) but not in the last position? Actually, we are not forced to avoid E in the last position? Actually, we know E is not at the 5th position in the secret word? But in our guess, we can put E anywhere? However, note that in the secret word, E is not at position 5.

 But we also know that the 4th letter is N.

 So let's list possible words:
 Pattern: _ _ _ N _

 Constraints:
 - The word has E in one of positions 1,2,3.
 - The word does not have C, R, A.

 Also, we can consider using letters that are common to gather more information about other letters.

 Alternatively, we can try to break down the positions:

 We can target positions 1,2,3, and 5.

 We know position 4 is fixed as N.

 For the next guess, we could try putting E in each of positions 1,2,3? But we don't know which one.

 Additionally, we don't know about the other letters.

 Let's try a word that has:
 - E in position 1, and includes other common letters that we haven't tested (since we only know that C,R,A are absent, we have a lot of letters left).

 Common consonants: we could try S, T, L, etc.

 But note: we have to avoid C, R, A.

 Possible second guess: ""SENTE"" -> but that has two E's? We don't know if the word allows duplicates? But the rules don't prohibit duplicates? Actually, the feedback symbols can handle duplicates? However, according to the game, duplicates are allowed? But note: in the example, there were no duplicates. But let me recall standard wordle: duplicates are allowed in the secret word? Actually, the rules might vary? But in this game, the problem says: ""After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.""

 Since the feedback does not specify rules about duplicates, I'll assume that the word can have duplicate letters? But in the absence of specific rules, I'll try to avoid duplicates to maximize information.

 However, note: if the secret word has duplicate E, then we could have two E's? But we don't know. So we should be cautious.

 But we have E present and we know it's not at position 5, so let's try placing E in position 1.

 One common word: EXIST? But that has S and T? However, we don't know if they are in the word.

 Alternatively, let's pick a word that has E in one of positions 1,2,3, and uses as many new letters as possible.

 Since we know the 4th letter is N, we can lock that in.

 Proposed structure: [E? or else] ... N and then the fifth letter.

 But also, we must avoid the letters C, R, A.

 Let me think of words with the pattern: 
 - First letter: ? (not C,R,A) and must include E somewhere in the first three positions.

 Possibilities: 
 If E is at position 1: E _ _ N _
    Example: ELINT? Not common ... 
    E in position 1: E_G_N, E_L_N, etc.

 Alternatively, we don't need to include E? Actually, we know E is present so we should include it to figure out its position? And also because we have limited guesses.

 Actually, we must include E in the word? No, but we can; but we should because we need to figure out where it is.

 Let me try a word like ""LEMON"": 
  L E M O N
 But we have N at the fourth position? In the word ""lemon"", the fourth letter is 'O', not 'N'. So that doesn't fit our pattern? Our pattern must have N at the fourth position.

 So the word must be: _ _ _ N _

 Now, with E present in the first three positions.

 Example words:
 Position 1: Examples: E? E at pos1: E__N_ -> E then two more letters then N then one. Words: ""eaten"", ""elton"", ""even""? But ""eaten"" has T and E? Or ""exine""? Not common.

 Position 2: _ E _ N _ : ""spent"", ""spend"", ""spent"", ""event""? But note: ""spent"": S, P, E, N, T -> N at fourth. And E at third? Actually: 
 Position 2: E? For instance: ""begin"" -> B E G I N -> N at fifth? No. 

 The positions for a word: 
 For a word with E at position 2 and N at position 4: 
 Positions: 1: ?, 2: E, 3: ?, 4: N, 5: ?

 Example: ""taken""? But ""taken"": T at1, A at2? But A is absent? So we cannot use A? Because we know A is not in the word? So ""taken"" is invalid.

 Position 3: _ _ E N _ : ""silent"": 
  - S at1, I at2, L? ... let me spell: ""silent"" -> S I L E N T -> fourth letter is E? not N? Actually: 
  S (1), I (2), L (3), E (4), N (5) -> not matching.

 We need: 
 Position 4 must be N.

 Example: ""queen"" -> QUEEN: Q (1), U (2), E (3), E (4), N (5). 
 But in our case: the fourth letter is N? So that doesn't work.

 Actually, let's list words that end with N? And have E in the first three? And avoid A, C, R.

 Also, note: we don't know about the first, second, third, and fifth letters? We know they are not C, R, A.

 So, let's pick a word that:
 - Has the 4th letter as N.
 - Includes E in one of positions 1,2,3.
 - Uses other common letters that we haven't tested.

 We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Possible words:
 ""SENT"" is four letters? So 5-letter words:

 Let me try: 
  - Position 3: E -> _ _ E N _
      Examples: token, laden, oaten? But no A? So token: T O K E N -> 
        T at1, O at2, K at3, E at4? No: 
        T (1), O (2), K (3), E (4), N (5) -> so fourth letter is E? That's not N.

 We need fourth letter to be N? So the word is ???N?.

 And E is in the first three: 
 Pattern: [letter1] [letter2] [letter3] N [letter5]

 Then E must be in letter1, letter2, or letter3.

 So:

 Pattern: E [ ] [ ] N [ ] 
 Pattern: [ ] E [ ] N [ ]
 Pattern: [ ] [ ] E N [ ]

 Now, words:

 Pattern 1: ""begin"" -> B E G I N -> but N is at fifth? Not fourth.

 Let me reconsider: we need N at fourth? So the word is:
  1: ?
  2: ?
  3: ?
  4: N
  5: ?

 And E must be at pos1,2, or3.

 Example: 
  E at pos1: ""eatin"" not a word? ""eatin"" non-standard. 
  How about ""eosin""? E O S I N -> E at1, O at2, S at3, I at4? Wait: 
      E (1), O(2), S(3), I(4), N(5) -> then fourth isn't N? That doesn't work.

 Another: ""eikon"": E I K O N -> 
    E(1), I(2), K(3), O(4), N(5) -> again, fourth is not N.

 What words end with ...N? Actually, the fourth letter being N? Then fifth letter can be anything? But the word must be 5 letters.

 Example: ""green"" -> G R E E N -> 
  G(1), R(2), E(3), E(4), N(5) -> but in this case:
  The fourth letter is E? Not N.

 How about ""thine"": T H I N E -> 
  T(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), E(5) -> 
  Wait, that's: 
    4th: N -> correct position? 
    E is at the fifth? But our feedback for ""crane"" had E at fifth and we got a dash meaning E is present but in wrong position? 

  Wait: that doesn't match because the secret word has E but not at fifth? So if the secret word were ""thine"", then E would be at fifth? But we guessed E at fifth and the feedback was '-' meaning in the word but wrong position? If E is at fifth, then that would be correct? So it would have been marked with '✓'. 

  Therefore, the secret word has E, but not at the fifth position? So ""thine"" would have E at fifth? Which would be correct? But we got '-' for E? That means the fifth letter of the secret word is not E? 

  So let's rule out E at fifth.

  Therefore, ""thine"" would be: T(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), E(5) -> for E at fifth: if secret word had E at fifth, it would be marked ✓. But we got '-', meaning E is present but not at fifth? So we are sure that fifth is not E.

  Hence, the fifth letter cannot be E? So in the secret word, E is in one of the first three.

  Thus, words like ""thine"" are invalid? Because the E at fifth would be ✓? But we got '-'.

  So, back to our pattern: 
  Secret word: _ _ _ N ? (where ? cannot be E)

  And E must be in position 1,2, or 3.

  Now, an example: ""spine"": 
    S P I N E -> 
    Position 4: N? Actually: 
        S(1), P(2), I(3), N(4), E(5) -> E at fifth? We just said fifth cannot be E? Because we got a dash for E at fifth? 

  But wait: we guessed E at fifth and got '-', meaning E is in the word but not at fifth? So spine would put E at fifth? So that would be invalid? 

  Unless the secret word does have E at fifth? Then why did we get '-'? Maybe I misunderstood? 

  Let me check the feedback: for the word ""crane"", we got E(-) meaning E is present in the secret but not in the fifth position? So the secret word does not have the fifth letter as E? 

  Hence, spine's fifth letter is E? So it would be incompatible? 

  Actually, spine: 
    Guess: S P I N E -> 
    If secret is spine, then E is at fifth? So the feedback would have been E(✓) for fifth? But we had the previous feedback for E as '-'? So that's not the secret.

  How about ""shine"": 
    S H I N ? -> but then fifth? If fifth is not E? Let me try words that end with T? 
    ""spent"": 
      S P E N T -> 
        S(1), P(2), E(3), N(4), T(5) -> 
        This fits: 
          N is at fourth? 
          E is at third? 
          And fifth letter is T? 

        So E is at third? 

        That matches: we have N at fourth and E not at fifth? 

        Also, spent doesn't use C,R,A? 

        But we haven't tested S,P,T? So let's consider.

  Another: ""token"": 
    T O K E N -> 
        T(1), O(2), K(3), E(4), N(5) -> 
        Here the fourth letter is E? That's not N? 

  Only words that have N at fourth and a non-E fifth letter?

  So pattern: _ _ _ N X, where X != E, and one of the first three must be E.

  Other words that fit: 
  ""linen"": 
    L I N E N -> 
        L(1), I(2), N(3), E(4), N(5) -> 
        So the fourth letter is E? Not N? 

  ""minim"": doesn't have E.

  ""demon"": 
    D E M O N -> 
        D(1), E(2), M(3), O(4), N(5) -> 
        So fourth letter is O? 

  Not matching.

  Let's try: 
    . E ? N ? -> so position2: E, then any letter at position3? 
    Example: ""xenon""? 
        X E N O N -> 
        X(1), E(2), N(3) ... -> then fourth letter is O? not N? 

  Actually, N is third? 

  Alternatively, try: . . E N ? 
    Example: ""spent"", ""spend"" (if allowed? wordle accepts spend), ""shend""? 

  ""spend"": 
    S(1), P(2), E(3), N(4), D(5) -> perfect: 
      N at fourth (so ✓ for N at fourth), 
      E at third (but we guessed E at fifth? so we don't know yet where E is).

  This meets our pattern? 
      The secret word must have E? So if the word is ""spend"", then E is at third.

  We need to use a word for our guess that:
    - Has the 4th letter as N? This is fixed? Because we know position4 is N? 
    - And contains E? But we don't know where? We can try different placements? 

  Since we don't want to guess the word right away? We want to maximize information.

  Alternatively, let's try to find a word that includes E and places it in a new position (not fifth) and tests multiple new letters.

  Proposed guess: ""scone"" -> but C is absent? We cannot use C? Avoid C,R,A.

  So we can't use C.

  Another: ""phone"" -> 
    P H O N E -> 
        P(1), H(2), O(3), N(4), E(5)
        Wait: since we fixed the fourth letter as N? We can put N at fourth? 
        But then E at fifth? We know the fifth letter isn't E? So why put E at fifth? 
        Also, we'll get feedback on E? But we already know E is in the word, but not at fifth? 

        For the fifth letter: we put E -> but the secret word doesn't have E there? So we would get a dash or absent? 

        Actually, we know from the feedback that the secret word has E? It will mark this E? 

        But it's better to put E somewhere else? To see if it lands in positions 1,2,3.

  Alternatively, avoid putting E at fifth? 

  So let's choose a word that:
    - Has N at the fourth position (locked).
    - Has E in position 1, 2, or 3.
    - Avoids C,R,A.
    - Uses new common letters such as S, T, L, P, etc.

  Example: 
    Position 3: E? -> so pattern: _ _ E N _

    Let's pick ""stend""? Not common? Or ""steed"": 
        S T E E D -> 
        Position 4: E! not N.

  ""steed"" would be: S(1), T(2), E(3), E(4), D(5) -> fourth is E? not good.

  ""spent"": S P E N T -> 
    Pattern: S(1), P(2), E(3), N(4), T(5) -> perfect.

  Is ""spent"" a valid word? I think so.

  Another option: ""spend"", given above.

  But note: we want to test letters? We haven't tested S or P or T? So it would be informative.

  Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn't fix E? But that might be less efficient? We need to test for E anyway? 

  Given the constraints, let's choose ""spent"".

  So our next guess: ""spent""

  The feedback will tell us:
    For S, P, E, T: 
    Specifically, we hope to learn about S, P, E, and T.

  And we confirm N is at 4th -> will receive ✓ at N.

  We guess the word: spent.

  But note: the secret might not have E at position 3? Because E could be at position 1 or 2. Our guess ""spent"" has E at 3. So if the secret word has E at position 1 or 2, then the E in this guess would be marked as '-'? 

  And we will get information about the absence/presence of S, P, T.

  Alternatively, if we don't want to commit to E in one position, we could try a word that has E in a different position? But we have to pick one.

  Another idea: use two E's? For example, ""bevel"" -> but no: because no N at fourth? And B is untested.

  But fixed pattern: we must have N at fourth? So we have no choice but to guess a word that has N at fourth.

  Therefore, let's go with ""spent"". 

  Another word that has E at position 1 and N at fourth: Eaten? But it contains A? Absent. 
  E at position 2: ""leant""? Again, A? 
  Or ""event"": 
    E V E N T -> 
        E(1), V(2), E(3), N(4), T(5) 
        But that has two E's? 

  But what does feedback do for duplicate letters? 
  For example, if the secret word is ""baton"", and we guess ""hating"", then first H is absent? and then second A is present? and so on? 

  However, to keep it simple, since ""spent"" doesn't use duplicates, let's go with it.

  So next guess: spent

  But note: the feedback for E in this guess will be:
    - If the secret word has E at position 3: then we get ✓ for E at third.
    - If the secret word has E at position 1: then since we guessed E at third? We would get a dash? 
    - Similarly, if at position 2? dash? 

  But also, we gather information about S and P?

  Also, note: T at fifth? If the secret word has T at fifth? Then we might get ✓ for T? But note: if not, we might get info that T is present or not.

  So I think ""spent"" is a good choice.

  Let me look for more words? 
    E at 1: ... maybe ""elint"" (not common)?
    E at 2: ... ""segment"" is too long? or ""lemon"" not fit? 

  Since we don't know, it's best to gather as much information as possible.

  So I choose ""spent"".

  Therefore, the guess is: spent

<guess>spent</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A are absent (marked 'x').
- N is in the correct position (4th, marked '✓').
- E is present but not in the 5th position (marked '-').

This means:
- The secret word format is `_ _ _ N _`.
- E must appear in one of positions 1, 2, or 3 (since it's not in position 5, and position 4 is N).
- C, R, A are eliminated.

For the next guess, I chose **""spent""** because:
- It locks in N at position 4.
- Places E in position 3 to test its placement.
- Introduces new common letters (S, P, T) to maximize information.
- Avoids excluded letters (C, R, A).

<guess>spent</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(-)
Guess 2: spent -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(-) E(-) N(✓) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane"" → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(-)
Second guess: ""spent"" → S(x), P(-), E(-), N(✓), T(x)

Summary of known information:
- The 4th letter is N (confirmed from both guesses).
- E is in the word but not at position 5 (from first guess). Moreover, from the second guess, E was guessed at position 3 and got '-' meaning it's not at position 3 (but still in the word).
- P was guessed at position 2 and got '-' meaning P is in the word but not at position 2.
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, S, T (all marked 'x').
- Also, from ""spent"": S(x), T(x) → so S and T are absent.

Therefore, eliminated letters: A, C, R, S, T.

Now, the secret word structure: _ _ _ N _
We know E is in the word and must be in position 1 or 2? Because position 4 is N and we know E is not in position 3 (from second guess) or 5 (from first guess). So E must be in position 1 or 2.

Also, P is in the word but not at position 2 (from the second guess: P at position 2 marked as '-').

So P is present and could be in positions 1, 3, or 5? But note the word has positions: 1, 2, 3, 4=N, 5.

We don't know which positions P can be? Only that it's not at position 2.

Now, let's list available letters:
Alphabet except: A, C, R, S, T. So available: B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we know E and P are present. Also, N is at position 4? That's fixed.

So secret word: [E must be here at 1 or 2] and P must be somewhere not position 2? And we have position 3 and 5 to fill? Along with position 1 or 2? Depending on E.

Since we are limited to 6 guesses, we need to make an informed third guess.

Goals for guess 3:
- Narrow down the position of E (is it at 1 or 2?).
- Find the position of P? But P could be at 1, 3, 5?
- Test other common letters.

But note: we know P is present? So why not use it? And E is also present? But we cannot put them in positions we know they can't be? So avoid E at positions 3 and 5? And avoid P at position 2.

Let me structure possible patterns:

Case 1: E at position 1
Then the word: E _ _ N _
But the second letter is not P? Since P is not allowed at position 2? But P could be at position 1? But if E is at position 1? Then P cannot be at 1? So P must be at position 3 or 5.

Case 2: E at position 2
Then the word: _ E _ N _
But note: position 2 is E? Then P cannot be at position 2? But that's okay? P would be at position 1, 3, or 5? But also, E is occupying position 2? So P cannot be at 2? Which is already covered.

So we must design a word that:
- Includes E and P (since they are present).
- E is placed in either position 1 or 2? Because we haven't tested those? But note: we already know E is not at 3 or 5? So we must test either position 1 or 2? But preferably both? But we can only put E in one position per guess.

However, we can make a guess that places E in position 1? Then we'll know if E is at 1? If not? Then it must be at 2? Because those are the only possibilities left? So we can deduce without testing position 2.

But we don't need to? Actually, we can try to put E in position 1? And see the feedback.

Similarly, we can also put P in position 3 or 5? And see? And then we hope to lock down E's position? And also P's position? Plus test new letters.

So let me try:

If we put E at position 1: then guess E ? ? N ?

But we must choose ? to be valid words? Also, avoid the eliminated letters? And we know P is present? So we should place P? Or can defer? But if we don't put P? Then we won't get feedback on its position? But we can? Actually, we don't have to put both E and P? But we know they are present? It's best to put them to learn about their positions? Otherwise, the guess might not be informative enough.

So:

Pattern if E at 1: E _ _ N _ 
But we know P is somewhere? And we don't have used P? So we must put P? How about E at 1, and P at 3? Or P at 5? 

Example word: ""epend"" -> not common? 
Another: ""elfin""? But that doesn't have the fourth as N? 
Or ""eveen""? Not valid.

Valid words:
E P ? N ? -> but then positions: 
Position1: E, position2: P? But wait: P cannot be at position 2? Because from the second guess? P placed at position 2 was marked '-' meaning it is not at that position? So P cannot be at position 2.

Therefore, we cannot put P at 2? So if we set E at 1, then the second letter cannot be P? So we can put P at 3 or 5? 

But what about position 3: P? Or position 5: P?

Let me think of words: 
- E at 1, P at 3: E _ P N _ 
  Example: ""empty""? 
    E M P T Y -> 
    But T is absent? So we cannot use T? Eliminated.

  Also: ""emple"" -> not common.

- E at 1, P at 5: E ? ? N P 
  Example: ""eaglep""? Not valid? Or ""eightp""? 
  More common: ""econp""? No.

But consider: E _ _ N P 
   letters: we need two letters? 
   Example: ""elintp""? No.

Actually, hard to find a word? Since N at fourth and P at fifth? And E at first? Then two letters? 
Such as ""eigen"": E I G E N -> but then fifth is N? not P? 
""ewinp""? Not common? 
""elump""? N? 
Not many options? 

Alternatively, if E at position 2: 
Pattern: _ E _ N _ 
And we can put P at position 1 or 3 or 5? 
But avoid position 2? Which we are putting E? 

So: 
- P at 1: P E _ N _ 
  Example: ""pengo""? But has G? 
  ""penup""? 
  Or: ""pekun""? 

- P at 3: _ E P N _ 
  Example: ""depnd""? 
  ""we"" are missing? 

Given the eliminated letters? We have to choose from: B,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? But we know E and P are already used? So the remaining must be from others? 

But note: we don't have to exhaust? We can choose a word that tests E at position 1 and introduces other letters? And P separately? 

But let me consider: we plan to put E at 1? Or at 2? Both possibilities? So we can design a word that covers both? Or not?

To maximize information? Let me pick the case that covers more? And tests other letters? 

Alternatively, maybe we don't need to try E? Because if we try E at 1? Then if E is at 2? We'll know? Or vice versa? So by trying E at 1? We can deduce: if we get '✓' for position1? Then E at1? Otherwise? E must be at position 2? Because we know it's not anywhere else? 

So we can do:

Guess: ""e"" at position 1, and then for position 3? We know it's not E? So we put a new letter? And then position 5? 

We also have to include P? Since we have to place P? But we don't know where P is? But we can put it at position 3? For example? 

Word: ""e"" at1, ""l"" at2, ""p"" at3, ""n"" at4, ""y"" at5: ""elpny"" → not a valid word? 

Valid words: 
Let me think: ""embed"" → E M B E D → but it has two E? And the pattern doesn't have N at 4th? 

""elbow""? Not ending with N? 

""Egged""? Not valid? 

Perhaps ""expan"" → but X,P,A? A is eliminated? 

""elven"" → E L V E N → 
    Pattern: E(1), L(2), V(3), E(4), N(5) →
    4th is E? not N? 

I need a word with E at1 and N at4? 

How about ""eatin""? Not valid? 
""edwin""? Proper noun? 

Valid English 5-letter words? 

Actually, the word often used? ""begin""? But G? 
But pattern: B E G I N → N at fifth? 

We need N at fourth? 

""E"" at first and N at fourth? Then the fifth letter? Let's be B? ""E"" not common? 

""earthing"" not 5 letters? 

Perhaps ""eikon""? But O is at fourth? 

I think there are not many common words with E at first and N at fourth? 

So maybe we shift to putting E at position 2?

If E at position 2: 
Pattern: _ E _ N _

Guess the first letter? And third? And fifth? 

We know P must be present? So we can put P at position 1 or 3 or 5? 

Example: 
- If P at position 1: P E ? N ?
  Example: ""pen"" related? 
      ""penknife"" too long? 
      ""penne"" → P E N N E → 
        Positions: 
          1: P, 2: E, 3: N? But we already have N at fourth? And guess has N at position 3 and 4? 
        But the secret has N only at fourth? So position 3? We don't know? 
        And the secret has E at position 2? So for ""penne"": 
          P at1: we don't know?
          E at2: might be ✓? 
          N at3: but in the secret? We don't know? If the secret does not have N at3? We'll get feedback? 
        But also, we have eliminated T? So ""penne"" is allowed? Letters: P,E,N,N,E? Not standard? But ""penne"" is a word? 5-letter? P-E-N-N-E.

        However, note: we have double N? But N at position 3 and 4? 
        Our feedback for N in ""crane"" and ""spent"" we had N at 4th? In ""penne"", we put:
          P at1: ?
          E at2: if the secret has E at2? Then ✓? 
          N at3: might be absent? Or might be present?
          N at4: ✓? 
          E at5: but secret has E at2? And we already know E is present? But if the secret does not have E at5? We will get dash for E at5? But we also have E at2? Which is correct? 
        This might be messy? 

  Alternatively, ""peony"" → P E O N Y -> 
      Pattern: P(1), E(2), O(3), N(4), Y(5)
      This is a common word. 
      And it doesn't use eliminated letters? 

  Also: 
      Position1: P → is that possible? Previously we only know P is present? Not its position? 
      Position2: E → if the secret has E at2? Then ✓? 
      Position3: O → we are guessing?
      Position4: N → ✓? 
      Position5: Y → new letter? 

  So this guess would be informative? 

  Why not? 

  But what if E is not at position 2? But at position 1? Then this guess won't work? Because we are having E at position 2? 

  But we have two cases:

  If we choose ""peony"", then:
    If the secret has E at position 1 (which is possible? and we don't know yet)? 
        then feedback on P? 
          P at1: would be a different letter? So feedback for P at1? Might be ✗ or dash? 
        E at2: even though E is present? But not at2? So would be dash? 

    But then we deduce? Because if E is at1, then it will show? 
    Or if at2, then it will be ✓? 

  Similarly for P? 

  Alternatively, if E is at position 1? Then we make a guess that doesn't test E at2? 

  But we need to know? 

  Also, we have only 6 guesses? We are on guess 3? 

  If we put E in position 1 in our guess? And the secret has E at position 1? We get ✓? And if not? Then we know it must be at position 2? 

  But as per? We are conflicted by the lack of common words with E at1 and N at4? 

  Let's search for a valid word that has:
    E at1? and N at4? and fifth letter not S,T,C,R,A? And includes P? 

  For example, ""E"" at1, ""P"" say at5? Then between: two letters? 

  Word: ""eppen""? Not common? 
  ""eplop""? No. 

  Valid English words: 
  ""edged"" —> doesn't have N? 
  ""eggup"" —> 
  Maybe ""empohen""? Not 5. 

  Considering scarcity, if I cannot find for E at1? Then maybe I put E at position 2? And also put P? In either position 1 or 3 or 5? 

  So let's go with a word that has E at2? And P at1? Also common other letters? 

  ""peony"" is a valid word: P E O N Y

  Why not use ""peony"" for guess 3? 

  We will learn:
    - If P at1 is ✓? Then P is at1? If not? Might be dash if in secret but not that position? 

    Also: about E at2? 
        If ✓? Then E is at2? 
        If not? Then since E must be in the word? And not at3 or5? Then it must be at1? 

        But then we'll see feedback? 

    Additionally, O and Y? 

  Also, it doesn't use any eliminated letter? 

  Therefore, let's guess: ""peony""

<guess>peony</guess> 
But wait: what if the secret word has E at position 1? Then we'll see:

  P (1): dash? Or absent? 
  But we know P is present? So it will be dash? 
  Then E at2? The secret has E at1? Not at2? So E not at2? Dash? 
  Then we know E must be at1? But we didn't test position1? 

  Then for the next guess? We can shift.

  So it is acceptable? 

  For this guess: 
    Even if we don't get E at2? We deduce from the feedback? 

  So I think ""peony"" is a good word.

  Alternatively, if we want to cover both? We can try a word that has E in a new position? But no? 

  So let's go with ""peony"".

  Also, note: we have to include N at4? Obviously? So ""peony"" has N at fourth? 

  Therefore: next guess: ""peony""### Feedback Analysis from Previous Guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(-)  
  - N is confirmed at position 4.  
  - E is in the secret word but not at position 5.  
- **Guess 2 (""spent"")**: S(x), P(-), E(-), N(✓), T(x)  
  - P is in the secret word but not at position 2.  
  - E is not at position 3 (since it was marked as ""-"", meaning present but wrong position).  
- **Key Insights**:  
  - Secret word format: `_ _ _ N _`.  
  - E must be in position 1 or 2 (not 3, 4, or 5).  
  - P is present but not at position 2.  
  - Eliminated letters: A, C, R, S, T.  
  - Valid letters include: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (besides confirmed E and P).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Goal**: Determine E's position (1 or 2) and P's location (not position 2). Use a word that places E correctly or provides positional feedback on both letters.  
- **Chosen Word: ""peony""**  
  - P at position 1: Tests if P is at the start.  
  - E at position 2: Tests if E is in this slot.  
  - O and Y: New letters to gather feedback.  
  - Fits the `_ E _ N _` pattern and avoids eliminated letters.  
- **Why ""peony""?**  
  - Tests E at position 2: If correct, we get ""✓"" for E; if not, we know E must be at position 1 (since it's not elsewhere).  
  - Tests P at position 1: We know P is present, so feedback will reveal if it's at position 1 or must be elsewhere (e.g., position 3 or 5).  
  - Uses common letters (O, Y) to maximize information gain.  

If E is not at position 2, the feedback will narrow E to position 1, and P's feedback will help pin its location.

Therefore, E must be in one of the first three position? Actually, the positions are 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 5th? No, wait: our guess was CRANE, which is:\n Position 1: C\n Position 2: R\n Position 3: A\n Position 4: N\n Position 5: E\n\n So the feedback tells us:\n - N is correct at position 4.\n - E is present but not at position 5. So E must be in positions 1, 2, or 3? But note: the word has 5 letters. Actually, the secret word has E in it, but not at position 5. It could be at position 1, 2, 3, or even at position 4? But position 4 is taken by N. So E must be at position 1, 2, or 3.\n\n However, we also know that the secret word does not contain C, R, A (because they are marked as absent). So the first three letters cannot be C, R, or A.\n\n Since E is in the word but not at the end, and we have the fourth letter as N, let\'s summarize:\n\n Secret word: [not C, R, A] [not C, R, A] [not C, R, A] N [some letter]\n\n And the word must contain E, which must be in one of positions 1, 2, 3.\n\n We now need to make a second guess that incorporates this information.\n\n Goals for the next guess:\n 1. We must include E (because it is present) but not in the last position? Actually, we are not forced to avoid E in the last position? Actually, we know E is not at the 5th position in the secret word? But in our guess, we can put E anywhere? However, note that in the secret word, E is not at position 5.\n\n But we also know that the 4th letter is N.\n\n So let\'s list possible words:\n Pattern: _ _ _ N _\n\n Constraints:\n - The word has E in one of positions 1,2,3.\n - The word does not have C, R, A.\n\n Also, we can consider using letters that are common to gather more information about other letters.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to break down the positions:\n\n We can target positions 1,2,3, and 5.\n\n We know position 4 is fixed as N.\n\n For the next guess, we could try putting E in each of positions 1,2,3? But we don\'t know which one.\n\n Additionally, we don\'t know about the other letters.\n\n Let\'s try a word that has:\n - E in position 1, and includes other common letters that we haven\'t tested (since we only know that C,R,A are absent, we have a lot of letters left).\n\n Common consonants: we could try S, T, L, etc.\n\n But note: we have to avoid C, R, A.\n\n Possible second guess: ""SENTE"" -> but that has two E\'s? We don\'t know if the word allows duplicates? But the rules don\'t prohibit duplicates? Actually, the feedback symbols can handle duplicates? However, according to the game, duplicates are allowed? But note: in the example, there were no duplicates. But let me recall standard wordle: duplicates are allowed in the secret word? Actually, the rules might vary? But in this game, the problem says: ""After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.""\n\n Since the feedback does not specify rules about duplicates, I\'ll assume that the word can have duplicate letters? But in the absence of specific rules, I\'ll try to avoid duplicates to maximize information.\n\n However, note: if the secret word has duplicate E, then we could have two E\'s? But we don\'t know. So we should be cautious.\n\n But we have E present and we know it\'s not at position 5, so let\'s try placing E in position 1.\n\n One common word: EXIST? But that has S and T? However, we don\'t know if they are in the word.\n\n Alternatively, let\'s pick a word that has E in one of positions 1,2,3, and uses as many new letters as possible.\n\n Since we know the 4th letter is N, we can lock that in.\n\n Proposed structure: [E? or else] ... N and then the fifth letter.\n\n But also, we must avoid the letters C, R, A.\n\n Let me think of words with the pattern: \n - First letter: ? (not C,R,A) and must include E somewhere in the first three positions.\n\n Possibilities: \n If E is at position 1: E _ _ N _\n    Example: ELINT? Not common ... \n    E in position 1: E_G_N, E_L_N, etc.\n\n Alternatively, we don\'t need to include E? Actually, we know E is present so we should include it to figure out its position? And also because we have limited guesses.\n\n Actually, we must include E in the word? No, but we can; but we should because we need to figure out where it is.\n\n Let me try a word like ""LEMON"": \n  L E M O N\n But we have N at the fourth position? In the word ""lemon"", the fourth letter is \'O\', not \'N\'. So that doesn\'t fit our pattern? Our pattern must have N at the fourth position.\n\n So the word must be: _ _ _ N _\n\n Now, with E present in the first three positions.\n\n Example words:\n Position 1: Examples: E? E at pos1: E__N_ -> E then two more letters then N then one. Words: ""eaten"", ""elton"", ""even""? But ""eaten"" has T and E? Or ""exine""? Not common.\n\n Position 2: _ E _ N _ : ""spent"", ""spend"", ""spent"", ""event""? But note: ""spent"": S, P, E, N, T -> N at fourth. And E at third? Actually: \n Position 2: E? For instance: ""begin"" -> B E G I N -> N at fifth? No. \n\n The positions for a word: \n For a word with E at position 2 and N at position 4: \n Positions: 1: ?, 2: E, 3: ?, 4: N, 5: ?\n\n Example: ""taken""? But ""taken"": T at1, A at2? But A is absent? So we cannot use A? Because we know A is not in the word? So ""taken"" is invalid.\n\n Position 3: _ _ E N _ : ""silent"": \n  - S at1, I at2, L? ... let me spell: ""silent"" -> S I L E N T -> fourth letter is E? not N? Actually: \n  S (1), I (2), L (3), E (4), N (5) -> not matching.\n\n We need: \n Position 4 must be N.\n\n Example: ""queen"" -> QUEEN: Q (1), U (2), E (3), E (4), N (5). \n But in our case: the fourth letter is N? So that doesn\'t work.\n\n Actually, let\'s list words that end with N? And have E in the first three? And avoid A, C, R.\n\n Also, note: we don\'t know about the first, second, third, and fifth letters? We know they are not C, R, A.\n\n So, let\'s pick a word that:\n - Has the 4th letter as N.\n - Includes E in one of positions 1,2,3.\n - Uses other common letters that we haven\'t tested.\n\n We haven\'t tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n Possible words:\n ""SENT"" is four letters? So 5-letter words:\n\n Let me try: \n  - Position 3: E -> _ _ E N _\n      Examples: token, laden, oaten? But no A? So token: T O K E N -> \n        T at1, O at2, K at3, E at4? No: \n        T (1), O (2), K (3), E (4), N (5) -> so fourth letter is E? That\'s not N.\n\n We need fourth letter to be N? So the word is ???N?.\n\n And E is in the first three: \n Pattern: [letter1] [letter2] [letter3] N [letter5]\n\n Then E must be in letter1, letter2, or letter3.\n\n So:\n\n Pattern: E [ ] [ ] N [ ] \n Pattern: [ ] E [ ] N [ ]\n Pattern: [ ] [ ] E N [ ]\n\n Now, words:\n\n Pattern 1: ""begin"" -> B E G I N -> but N is at fifth? Not fourth.\n\n Let me reconsider: we need N at fourth? So the word is:\n  1: ?\n  2: ?\n  3: ?\n  4: N\n  5: ?\n\n And E must be at pos1,2, or3.\n\n Example: \n  E at pos1: ""eatin"" not a word? ""eatin"" non-standard. \n  How about ""eosin""? E O S I N -> E at1, O at2, S at3, I at4? Wait: \n      E (1), O(2), S(3), I(4), N(5) -> then fourth isn\'t N? That doesn\'t work.\n\n Another: ""eikon"": E I K O N -> \n    E(1), I(2), K(3), O(4), N(5) -> again, fourth is not N.\n\n What words end with ...N? Actually, the fourth letter being N? Then fifth letter can be anything? But the word must be 5 letters.\n\n Example: ""green"" -> G R E E N -> \n  G(1), R(2), E(3), E(4), N(5) -> but in this case:\n  The fourth letter is E? Not N.\n\n How about ""thine"": T H I N E -> \n  T(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), E(5) -> \n  Wait, that\'s: \n    4th: N -> correct position? \n    E is at the fifth? But our feedback for ""crane"" had E at fifth and we got a dash meaning E is present but in wrong position? \n\n  Wait: that doesn\'t match because the secret word has E but not at fifth? So if the secret word were ""thine"", then E would be at fifth? But we guessed E at fifth and the feedback was \'-\' meaning in the word but wrong position? If E is at fifth, then that would be correct? So it would have been marked with \'✓\'. \n\n  Therefore, the secret word has E, but not at the fifth position? So ""thine"" would have E at fifth? Which would be correct? But we got \'-\' for E? That means the fifth letter of the secret word is not E? \n\n  So let\'s rule out E at fifth.\n\n  Therefore, ""thine"" would be: T(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), E(5) -> for E at fifth: if secret word had E at fifth, it would be marked ✓. But we got \'-\', meaning E is present but not at fifth? So we are sure that fifth is not E.\n\n  Hence, the fifth letter cannot be E? So in the secret word, E is in one of the first three.\n\n  Thus, words like ""thine"" are invalid? Because the E at fifth would be ✓? But we got \'-\'.\n\n  So, back to our pattern: \n  Secret word: _ _ _ N ? (where ? cannot be E)\n\n  And E must be in position 1,2, or 3.\n\n  Now, an example: ""spine"": \n    S P I N E -> \n    Position 4: N? Actually: \n        S(1), P(2), I(3), N(4), E(5) -> E at fifth? We just said fifth cannot be E? Because we got a dash for E at fifth? \n\n  But wait: we guessed E at fifth and got \'-\', meaning E is in the word but not at fifth? So spine would put E at fifth? So that would be invalid? \n\n  Unless the secret word does have E at fifth? Then why did we get \'-\'? Maybe I misunderstood? \n\n  Let me check the feedback: for the word ""crane"", we got E(-) meaning E is present in the secret but not in the fifth position? So the secret word does not have the fifth letter as E? \n\n  Hence, spine\'s fifth letter is E? So it would be incompatible? \n\n  Actually, spine: \n    Guess: S P I N E -> \n    If secret is spine, then E is at fifth? So the feedback would have been E(✓) for fifth? But we had the previous feedback for E as \'-\'? So that\'s not the secret.\n\n  How about ""shine"": \n    S H I N ? -> but then fifth? If fifth is not E? Let me try words that end with T? \n    ""spent"": \n      S P E N T -> \n        S(1), P(2), E(3), N(4), T(5) -> \n        This fits: \n          N is at fourth? \n          E is at third? \n          And fifth letter is T? \n\n        So E is at third? \n\n        That matches: we have N at fourth and E not at fifth? \n\n        Also, spent doesn\'t use C,R,A? \n\n        But we haven\'t tested S,P,T? So let\'s consider.\n\n  Another: ""token"": \n    T O K E N -> \n        T(1), O(2), K(3), E(4), N(5) -> \n        Here the fourth letter is E? That\'s not N? \n\n  Only words that have N at fourth and a non-E fifth letter?\n\n  So pattern: _ _ _ N X, where X != E, and one of the first three must be E.\n\n  Other words that fit: \n  ""linen"": \n    L I N E N -> \n        L(1), I(2), N(3), E(4), N(5) -> \n        So the fourth letter is E? Not N? \n\n  ""minim"": doesn\'t have E.\n\n  ""demon"": \n    D E M O N -> \n        D(1), E(2), M(3), O(4), N(5) -> \n        So fourth letter is O? \n\n  Not matching.\n\n  Let\'s try: \n    . E ? N ? -> so position2: E, then any letter at position3? \n    Example: ""xenon""? \n        X E N O N -> \n        X(1), E(2), N(3) ... -> then fourth letter is O? not N? \n\n  Actually, N is third? \n\n  Alternatively, try: . . E N ? \n    Example: ""spent"", ""spend"" (if allowed? wordle accepts spend), ""shend""? \n\n  ""spend"": \n    S(1), P(2), E(3), N(4), D(5) -> perfect: \n      N at fourth (so ✓ for N at fourth), \n      E at third (but we guessed E at fifth? so we don\'t know yet where E is).\n\n  This meets our pattern? \n      The secret word must have E? So if the word is ""spend"", then E is at third.\n\n  We need to use a word for our guess that:\n    - Has the 4th letter as N? This is fixed? Because we know position4 is N? \n    - And contains E? But we don\'t know where? We can try different placements? \n\n  Since we don\'t want to guess the word right away? We want to maximize information.\n\n  Alternatively, let\'s try to find a word that includes E and places it in a new position (not fifth) and tests multiple new letters.\n\n  Proposed guess: ""scone"" -> but C is absent? We cannot use C? Avoid C,R,A.\n\n  So we can\'t use C.\n\n  Another: ""phone"" -> \n    P H O N E -> \n        P(1), H(2), O(3), N(4), E(5)\n        Wait: since we fixed the fourth letter as N? We can put N at fourth? \n        But then E at fifth? We know the fifth letter isn\'t E? So why put E at fifth? \n        Also, we\'ll get feedback on E? But we already know E is in the word, but not at fifth? \n\n        For the fifth letter: we put E -> but the secret word doesn\'t have E there? So we would get a dash or absent? \n\n        Actually, we know from the feedback that the secret word has E? It will mark this E? \n\n        But it\'s better to put E somewhere else? To see if it lands in positions 1,2,3.\n\n  Alternatively, avoid putting E at fifth? \n\n  So let\'s choose a word that:\n    - Has N at the fourth position (locked).\n    - Has E in position 1, 2, or 3.\n    - Avoids C,R,A.\n    - Uses new common letters such as S, T, L, P, etc.\n\n  Example: \n    Position 3: E? -> so pattern: _ _ E N _\n\n    Let\'s pick ""stend""? Not common? Or ""steed"": \n        S T E E D -> \n        Position 4: E! not N.\n\n  ""steed"" would be: S(1), T(2), E(3), E(4), D(5) -> fourth is E? not good.\n\n  ""spent"": S P E N T -> \n    Pattern: S(1), P(2), E(3), N(4), T(5) -> perfect.\n\n  Is ""spent"" a valid word? I think so.\n\n  Another option: ""spend"", given above.\n\n  But note: we want to test letters? We haven\'t tested S or P or T? So it would be informative.\n\n  Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn\'t fix E? But that might be less efficient? We need to test for E anyway? \n\n  Given the constraints, let\'s choose ""spent"".\n\n  So our next guess: ""spent""\n\n  The feedback will tell us:\n    For S, P, E, T: \n    Specifically, we hope to learn about S, P, E, and T.\n\n  And we confirm N is at 4th -> will receive ✓ at N.\n\n  We guess the word: spent.\n\n  But note: the secret might not have E at position 3? Because E could be at position 1 or 2. Our guess ""spent"" has E at 3. So if the secret word has E at position 1 or 2, then the E in this guess would be marked as \'-\'? \n\n  And we will get information about the absence/presence of S, P, T.\n\n  Alternatively, if we don\'t want to commit to E in one position, we could try a word that has E in a different position? But we have to pick one.\n\n  Another idea: use two E\'s? For example, ""bevel"" -> but no: because no N at fourth? And B is untested.\n\n  But fixed pattern: we must have N at fourth? So we have no choice but to guess a word that has N at fourth.\n\n  Therefore, let\'s go with ""spent"". \n\n  Another word that has E at position 1 and N at fourth: Eaten? But it contains A? Absent. \n  E at position 2: ""leant""? Again, A? \n  Or ""event"": \n    E V E N T -> \n        E(1), V(2), E(3), N(4), T(5) \n        But that has two E\'s? \n\n  But what does feedback do for duplicate letters? \n  For example, if the secret word is ""baton"", and we guess ""hating"", then first H is absent? and then second A is present? and so on? \n\n  However, to keep it simple, since ""spent"" doesn\'t use duplicates, let\'s go with it.\n\n  So next guess: spent\n\n  But note: the feedback for E in this guess will be:\n    - If the secret word has E at position 3: then we get ✓ for E at third.\n    - If the secret word has E at position 1: then since we guessed E at third? We would get a dash? \n    - Similarly, if at position 2? dash? \n\n  But also, we gather information about S and P?\n\n  Also, note: T at fifth? If the secret word has T at fifth? Then we might get ✓ for T? But note: if not, we might get info that T is present or not.\n\n  So I think ""spent"" is a good choice.\n\n  Let me look for more words? \n    E at 1: ... maybe ""elint"" (not common)?\n    E at 2: ... ""segment"" is too long? or ""lemon"" not fit? \n\n  Since we don\'t know, it\'s best to gather as much information as possible.\n\n  So I choose ""spent"".\n\n  Therefore, the guess is: spent\n\n<guess>spent</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, A are absent (marked \'x\').\n- N is in the correct position (4th, marked \'✓\').\n- E is present but not in the 5th position (marked \'-\').\n\nThis means:\n- The secret word format is `_ _ _ N _`.\n- E must appear in one of positions 1, 2, or 3 (since it\'s not in position 5, and position 4 is N).\n- C, R, A are eliminated.\n\nFor the next guess, I chose **""spent""** because:\n- It locks in N at position 4.\n- Places E in position 3 to test its placement.\n- Introduces new common letters (S, P, T) to maximize information.\n- Avoids excluded letters (C, R, A).\n\n<guess>spent</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(-)\nGuess 2: spent -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(-) E(-) N(✓) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from two guesses:\n\nFirst guess: ""crane"" → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(-)\nSecond guess: ""spent"" → S(x), P(-), E(-), N(✓), T(x)\n\nSummary of known information:\n- The 4th letter is N (confirmed from both guesses).\n- E is in the word but not at position 5 (from first guess). Moreover, from the second guess, E was guessed at position 3 and got \'-\' meaning it\'s not at position 3 (but still in the word).\n- P was guessed at position 2 and got \'-\' meaning P is in the word but not at position 2.\n- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, S, T (all marked \'x\').\n- Also, from ""spent"": S(x), T(x) → so S and T are absent.\n\nTherefore, eliminated letters: A, C, R, S, T.\n\nNow, the secret word structure: _ _ _ N _\nWe know E is in the word and must be in position 1 or 2? Because position 4 is N and we know E is not in position 3 (from second guess) or 5 (from first guess). So E must be in position 1 or 2.\n\nAlso, P is in the word but not at position 2 (from the second guess: P at position 2 marked as \'-\').\n\nSo P is present and could be in positions 1, 3, or 5? But note the word has positions: 1, 2, 3, 4=N, 5.\n\nWe don\'t know which positions P can be? Only that it\'s not at position 2.\n\nNow, let\'s list available letters:\nAlphabet except: A, C, R, S, T. So available: B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we know E and P are present. Also, N is at position 4? That\'s fixed.\n\nSo secret word: [E must be here at 1 or 2] and P must be somewhere not position 2? And we have position 3 and 5 to fill? Along with position 1 or 2? Depending on E.\n\nSince we are limited to 6 guesses, we need to make an informed third guess.\n\nGoals for guess 3:\n- Narrow down the position of E (is it at 1 or 2?).\n- Find the position of P? But P could be at 1, 3, 5?\n- Test other common letters.\n\nBut note: we know P is present? So why not use it? And E is also present? But we cannot put them in positions we know they can\'t be? So avoid E at positions 3 and 5? And avoid P at position 2.\n\nLet me structure possible patterns:\n\nCase 1: E at position 1\nThen the word: E _ _ N _\nBut the second letter is not P? Since P is not allowed at position 2? But P could be at position 1? But if E is at position 1? Then P cannot be at 1? So P must be at position 3 or 5.\n\nCase 2: E at position 2\nThen the word: _ E _ N _\nBut note: position 2 is E? Then P cannot be at position 2? But that\'s okay? P would be at position 1, 3, or 5? But also, E is occupying position 2? So P cannot be at 2? Which is already covered.\n\nSo we must design a word that:\n- Includes E and P (since they are present).\n- E is placed in either position 1 or 2? Because we haven\'t tested those? But note: we already know E is not at 3 or 5? So we must test either position 1 or 2? But preferably both? But we can only put E in one position per guess.\n\nHowever, we can make a guess that places E in position 1? Then we\'ll know if E is at 1? If not? Then it must be at 2? Because those are the only possibilities left? So we can deduce without testing position 2.\n\nBut we don\'t need to? Actually, we can try to put E in position 1? And see the feedback.\n\nSimilarly, we can also put P in position 3 or 5? And see? And then we hope to lock down E\'s position? And also P\'s position? Plus test new letters.\n\nSo let me try:\n\nIf we put E at position 1: then guess E ? ? N ?\n\nBut we must choose ? to be valid words? Also, avoid the eliminated letters? And we know P is present? So we should place P? Or can defer? But if we don\'t put P? Then we won\'t get feedback on its position? But we can? Actually, we don\'t have to put both E and P? But we know they are present? It\'s best to put them to learn about their positions? Otherwise, the guess might not be informative enough.\n\nSo:\n\nPattern if E at 1: E _ _ N _ \nBut we know P is somewhere? And we don\'t have used P? So we must put P? How about E at 1, and P at 3? Or P at 5? \n\nExample word: ""epend"" -> not common? \nAnother: ""elfin""? But that doesn\'t have the fourth as N? \nOr ""eveen""? Not valid.\n\nValid words:\nE P ? N ? -> but then positions: \nPosition1: E, position2: P? But wait: P cannot be at position 2? Because from the second guess? P placed at position 2 was marked \'-\' meaning it is not at that position? So P cannot be at position 2.\n\nTherefore, we cannot put P at 2? So if we set E at 1, then the second letter cannot be P? So we can put P at 3 or 5? \n\nBut what about position 3: P? Or position 5: P?\n\nLet me think of words: \n- E at 1, P at 3: E _ P N _ \n  Example: ""empty""? \n    E M P T Y -> \n    But T is absent? So we cannot use T? Eliminated.\n\n  Also: ""emple"" -> not common.\n\n- E at 1, P at 5: E ? ? N P \n  Example: ""eaglep""? Not valid? Or ""eightp""? \n  More common: ""econp""? No.\n\nBut consider: E _ _ N P \n   letters: we need two letters? \n   Example: ""elintp""? No.\n\nActually, hard to find a word? Since N at fourth and P at fifth? And E at first? Then two letters? \nSuch as ""eigen"": E I G E N -> but then fifth is N? not P? \n""ewinp""? Not common? \n""elump""? N? \nNot many options? \n\nAlternatively, if E at position 2: \nPattern: _ E _ N _ \nAnd we can put P at position 1 or 3 or 5? \nBut avoid position 2? Which we are putting E? \n\nSo: \n- P at 1: P E _ N _ \n  Example: ""pengo""? But has G? \n  ""penup""? \n  Or: ""pekun""? \n\n- P at 3: _ E P N _ \n  Example: ""depnd""? \n  ""we"" are missing? \n\nGiven the eliminated letters? We have to choose from: B,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? But we know E and P are already used? So the remaining must be from others? \n\nBut note: we don\'t have to exhaust? We can choose a word that tests E at position 1 and introduces other letters? And P separately? \n\nBut let me consider: we plan to put E at 1? Or at 2? Both possibilities? So we can design a word that covers both? Or not?\n\nTo maximize information? Let me pick the case that covers more? And tests other letters? \n\nAlternatively, maybe we don\'t need to try E? Because if we try E at 1? Then if E is at 2? We\'ll know? Or vice versa? So by trying E at 1? We can deduce: if we get \'✓\' for position1? Then E at1? Otherwise? E must be at position 2? Because we know it\'s not anywhere else? \n\nSo we can do:\n\nGuess: ""e"" at position 1, and then for position 3? We know it\'s not E? So we put a new letter? And then position 5? \n\nWe also have to include P? Since we have to place P? But we don\'t know where P is? But we can put it at position 3? For example? \n\nWord: ""e"" at1, ""l"" at2, ""p"" at3, ""n"" at4, ""y"" at5: ""elpny"" → not a valid word? \n\nValid words: \nLet me think: ""embed"" → E M B E D → but it has two E? And the pattern doesn\'t have N at 4th? \n\n""elbow""? Not ending with N? \n\n""Egged""? Not valid? \n\nPerhaps ""expan"" → but X,P,A? A is eliminated? \n\n""elven"" → E L V E N → \n    Pattern: E(1), L(2), V(3), E(4), N(5) →\n    4th is E? not N? \n\nI need a word with E at1 and N at4? \n\nHow about ""eatin""? Not valid? \n""edwin""? Proper noun? \n\nValid English 5-letter words? \n\nActually, the word often used? ""begin""? But G? \nBut pattern: B E G I N → N at fifth? \n\nWe need N at fourth? \n\n""E"" at first and N at fourth? Then the fifth letter? Let\'s be B? ""E"" not common? \n\n""earthing"" not 5 letters? \n\nPerhaps ""eikon""? But O is at fourth? \n\nI think there are not many common words with E at first and N at fourth? \n\nSo maybe we shift to putting E at position 2?\n\nIf E at position 2: \nPattern: _ E _ N _\n\nGuess the first letter? And third? And fifth? \n\nWe know P must be present? So we can put P at position 1 or 3 or 5? \n\nExample: \n- If P at position 1: P E ? N ?\n  Example: ""pen"" related? \n      ""penknife"" too long? \n      ""penne"" → P E N N E → \n        Positions: \n          1: P, 2: E, 3: N? But we already have N at fourth? And guess has N at position 3 and 4? \n        But the secret has N only at fourth? So position 3? We don\'t know? \n        And the secret has E at position 2? So for ""penne"": \n          P at1: we don\'t know?\n          E at2: might be ✓? \n          N at3: but in the secret? We don\'t know? If the secret does not have N at3? We\'ll get feedback? \n        But also, we have eliminated T? So ""penne"" is allowed? Letters: P,E,N,N,E? Not standard? But ""penne"" is a word? 5-letter? P-E-N-N-E.\n\n        However, note: we have double N? But N at position 3 and 4? \n        Our feedback for N in ""crane"" and ""spent"" we had N at 4th? In ""penne"", we put:\n          P at1: ?\n          E at2: if the secret has E at2? Then ✓? \n          N at3: might be absent? Or might be present?\n          N at4: ✓? \n          E at5: but secret has E at2? And we already know E is present? But if the secret does not have E at5? We will get dash for E at5? But we also have E at2? Which is correct? \n        This might be messy? \n\n  Alternatively, ""peony"" → P E O N Y -> \n      Pattern: P(1), E(2), O(3), N(4), Y(5)\n      This is a common word. \n      And it doesn\'t use eliminated letters? \n\n  Also: \n      Position1: P → is that possible? Previously we only know P is present? Not its position? \n      Position2: E → if the secret has E at2? Then ✓? \n      Position3: O → we are guessing?\n      Position4: N → ✓? \n      Position5: Y → new letter? \n\n  So this guess would be informative? \n\n  Why not? \n\n  But what if E is not at position 2? But at position 1? Then this guess won\'t work? Because we are having E at position 2? \n\n  But we have two cases:\n\n  If we choose ""peony"", then:\n    If the secret has E at position 1 (which is possible? and we don\'t know yet)? \n        then feedback on P? \n          P at1: would be a different letter? So feedback for P at1? Might be ✗ or dash? \n        E at2: even though E is present? But not at2? So would be dash? \n\n    But then we deduce? Because if E is at1, then it will show? \n    Or if at2, then it will be ✓? \n\n  Similarly for P? \n\n  Alternatively, if E is at position 1? Then we make a guess that doesn\'t test E at2? \n\n  But we need to know? \n\n  Also, we have only 6 guesses? We are on guess 3? \n\n  If we put E in position 1 in our guess? And the secret has E at position 1? We get ✓? And if not? Then we know it must be at position 2? \n\n  But as per? We are conflicted by the lack of common words with E at1 and N at4? \n\n  Let\'s search for a valid word that has:\n    E at1? and N at4? and fifth letter not S,T,C,R,A? And includes P? \n\n  For example, ""E"" at1, ""P"" say at5? Then between: two letters? \n\n  Word: ""eppen""? Not common? \n  ""eplop""? No. \n\n  Valid English words: \n  ""edged"" —> doesn\'t have N? \n  ""eggup"" —> \n  Maybe ""empohen""? Not 5. \n\n  Considering scarcity, if I cannot find for E at1? Then maybe I put E at position 2? And also put P? In either position 1 or 3 or 5? \n\n  So let\'s go with a word that has E at2? And P at1? Also common other letters? \n\n  ""peony"" is a valid word: P E O N Y\n\n  Why not use ""peony"" for guess 3? \n\n  We will learn:\n    - If P at1 is ✓? Then P is at1? If not? Might be dash if in secret but not that position? \n\n    Also: about E at2? \n        If ✓? Then E is at2? \n        If not? Then since E must be in the word? And not at3 or5? Then it must be at1? \n\n        But then we\'ll see feedback? \n\n    Additionally, O and Y? \n\n  Also, it doesn\'t use any eliminated letter? \n\n  Therefore, let\'s guess: ""peony""\n\n<guess>peony</guess> \nBut wait: what if the secret word has E at position 1? Then we\'ll see:\n\n  P (1): dash? Or absent? \n  But we know P is present? So it will be dash? \n  Then E at2? The secret has E at1? Not at2? So E not at2? Dash? \n  Then we know E must be at1? But we didn\'t test position1? \n\n  Then for the next guess? We can shift.\n\n  So it is acceptable? \n\n  For this guess: \n    Even if we don\'t get E at2? We deduce from the feedback? \n\n  So I think ""peony"" is a good word.\n\n  Alternatively, if we want to cover both? We can try a word that has E in a new position? But no? \n\n  So let\'s go with ""peony"".\n\n  Also, note: we have to include N at4? Obviously? So ""peony"" has N at fourth? \n\n  Therefore: next guess: ""peony""### Feedback Analysis from Previous Guesses:\n- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(-)  \n  - N is confirmed at position 4.  \n  - E is in the secret word but not at position 5.  \n- **Guess 2 (""spent"")**: S(x), P(-), E(-), N(✓), T(x)  \n  - P is in the secret word but not at position 2.  \n  - E is not at position 3 (since it was marked as ""-"", meaning present but wrong position).  \n- **Key Insights**:  \n  - Secret word format: `_ _ _ N _`.  \n  - E must be in position 1 or 2 (not 3, 4, or 5).  \n  - P is present but not at position 2.  \n  - Eliminated letters: A, C, R, S, T.  \n  - Valid letters include: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (besides confirmed E and P).  \n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- **Goal**: Determine E\'s position (1 or 2) and P\'s location (not position 2).

We have the feedback from the third guess ""peony"":
  P(✓) E(✓) O(x) N(✓) Y(✓)

This means:
  P is correct at position 1.
  E is correct at position 2.
  O is absent (not in the word).
  N is correct at position 4 (already known).
  Y is correct at position 5.

So the secret word is: P E _ N Y

We know the first, second, fourth, and fifth letters: P, E, N, Y.
We are missing the third letter.

The secret word is: P E ? N Y

We also know from previous feedback:
  - The word does not contain: A, C, R, S, T, O (from the feedback of the three guesses).
  - We have used: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, T, O, Y.

The third letter must be a letter that hasn't been eliminated and is not in the list of absent letters.

Eliminated letters (absent): A, C, R, S, T, O.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need to find a 5-letter word of the form ""PE?NY"" that is a valid English word and uses one of the available letters.

Let's list possible words:

- ""PENNY"": But we have N at the fourth and fifth? No, the word is P E ? N Y. So the fifth is Y, not N. So ""penny"" would be P E N N Y? But that has two N's? And the third letter would be N? But we don't know if N can be duplicated? However, the feedback for ""peony"" had N at fourth and fifth? Wait, no: in ""peony"", we have N at fourth and Y at fifth? And we got Y(✓) at fifth? So the secret word has Y at fifth? So ""penny"" would be P E N N Y? But that has N at third? And we don't know if that's allowed? But the feedback for ""spent"" had N at fourth? And we didn't have a third N? So it's possible? But let's check the feedback for ""peony"": we got N(✓) at fourth? So the secret has N at fourth? And Y at fifth? So the third letter is not N? Because if it were, then in ""peony"" we didn't have a third N? So we don't know? Actually, the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we haven't encountered any duplicate feedback? 

But note: in the first guess ""crane"", we had one N? And it was at fourth? And in the secret word, we have N at fourth? And in ""spent"", we had N at fourth? And in ""peony"", we had N at fourth? So we don't have information about a duplicate N? 

However, the word ""penny"" has two N's? But the secret word is P E ? N Y? So the third letter is the only missing? And the fourth is N? So if the third letter is N? Then the word is P E N N Y? That is ""penny"" with a Y at the end? But that's not a word? The word ""penny"" is P-E-N-N-Y? So the fifth letter is Y? But in our pattern, the fifth letter is Y? So ""penny"" fits? 

But is ""penny"" a valid word? Yes, it is.

But let's check the letters: 
  P, E, N, N, Y.

But we have two N's? And we know the secret word has at least one N at the fourth? But it might have another? 

But in the feedback for ""peony"": 
  We guessed ""peony"": P, E, O, N, Y.
  The secret word is P E ? N Y.
  If the secret word is ""penny"", then:
      Position 1: P (✓) -> correct.
      Position 2: E (✓) -> correct.
      Position 3: O vs N? The secret has N at position 3? But we guessed O? So O is not in the word? And we got O(x) which is correct? Because O is absent? 
      Position 4: N (✓) -> correct.
      Position 5: Y (✓) -> correct.

  So it matches? 

But we also have to check if ""penny"" uses any eliminated letter? It uses P, E, N, Y? And N is duplicated? But the eliminated letters are A,C,R,S,T,O? So no conflict.

But is there any other word? 

Other possibilities for the third letter? 

We need a word: P E ? N Y, where ? is a letter from the available set: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

What words exist?
  - ""penny"": with ? = N -> but N is not in the available set? Because we haven't eliminated N? But we know N is in the word? But we are allowed to use it again? 

But the available set I listed was the letters that haven't been eliminated? But N is present? So we can use it? 

But let me list all possible words:

  ""peony"" is already guessed? And not the secret? Because we got O absent? 

  Other words:
    ""penny"": P E N N Y -> valid.
    ""peeny"": not common? 
    ""peiny"": not a word?
    ""pewny"": not a word?

  ""pesky"": but S is eliminated? 

  ""pelfy"": not common? 

  ""perky"": but R is eliminated? 

  ""pesty"": but S and T eliminated? 

  ""peggy"": G? That might be? P E G N Y? But that's not a word? Because the fourth letter is N? So it would be P E G N Y? Is that a word? I don't think so? 

  ""pigmy"": P I G M Y -> but that doesn't have N at fourth? 

  We must have the pattern: P E ? N Y.

  So the only common word I can think of is ""penny"".

But let me confirm: 
  ""penny"" is P-E-N-N-Y? 
  Positions: 
      1: P
      2: E
      3: N
      4: N
      5: Y

  But in our pattern, the fourth letter is N? And the fifth is Y? So it matches? 

  And the third letter is N? 

  But we have to check if the feedback from previous guesses allows duplicate N? 

  In the first guess ""crane"": we had one N at fourth? And it was correct? But the secret word ""penny"" has two N's? So when we guessed ""crane"", we only got one N marked? But that's because we only provided one N? 

  The feedback for ""crane"": 
      C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(-)
  The secret ""penny"" has two N's? But we only guessed one N? So the feedback would mark the N at the correct position? And since there is another N? But we didn't guess it? So it doesn't show? 

  Similarly, in ""spent"": 
      S(x), P(-), E(-), N(✓), T(x)
  We guessed N at fourth? Correct? And there is another N at third? But we didn't guess a letter at third? So it doesn't affect? 

  And in ""peony"": 
      P(✓), E(✓), O(x), N(✓), Y(✓)
  We guessed N at fourth? Correct? And the third letter we guessed O? Which is absent? So no issue? 

  So ""penny"" is a valid possibility? 

But are there other words? 

  ""jiffy""? Not matching pattern.

  ""pinky"": P I N K Y -> but that would be P at1, I at2, N at3, K at4, Y at5? But we need the fourth letter to be N? So if the secret were ""pinky"", then the fourth letter is K? But we know the fourth letter is N? So not.

  Similarly, ""pinny"": P I N N Y -> 
      This is a word? Meaning a type of apron? Or a variant? 
      Pattern: P(1), I(2), N(3), N(4), Y(5) -> 
      So the fourth letter is N? And fifth is Y? 
      So it fits the pattern? 

  But we have two words: ""penny"" and ""pinny""? 

  Also, ""punny"": P U N N Y -> meaning something that is a pun? 
      Pattern: P(1), U(2), N(3), N(4), Y(5) -> also fits.

  And ""funny""? But F at first? 

  So possible words: 
      ""penny"" (if the third letter is E? But no: the second is E? So third is N? So ""penny"")
      ""pinny"" (third letter I)
      ""punny"" (third letter U)

  But we also have to check the eliminated letters? 

  Eliminated: A, C, R, S, T, O.

  So for ""pinny"": I is not eliminated? 
      ""pinny"": P I N N Y -> I is available? 
  ""punny"": U is available? 

  So we have three candidates: 
      ""penny"", ""pinny"", ""punny""

  But note: we have to consider if the third letter can be N? 

  In the word ""penny"", the third letter is N? 

  How do we distinguish? 

  We need to make a guess that can identify which one it is? 

  But we are on the fourth guess? We have two more guesses? 

  Alternatively, we can guess one of them? 

  But let's see what we know? 

  We haven't tested I or U? 

  So we can try a word that includes I and U? But we only have one letter to guess? 

  Actually, the secret word is one of: 
      ""penny"", ""pinny"", ""punny""

  We can try a word that is not of the form P E ? N Y? But that would be inefficient? 

  Since we have three possibilities, we can try one? 

  But note: we have to use a valid word? 

  Alternatively, we can try a word that has I and U? But we don't have to? 

  Since we are missing only the third letter? And we have three options? We can try ""pinny"" for example? 

  But if we guess ""pinny"", and it's not the secret? Then we get feedback? 

  Similarly, we can try ""penny""? 

  But let's think: we have not used I or U? So we don't know if they are present? 

  However, in the secret word, the only unknown letter is the third? And it can be N, I, or U? 

  But note: if the third letter is N, then the word is ""penny""? 
  If it is I, then ""pinny""? 
  If it is U, then ""punny""? 

  So we can try ""penny"" as a guess? 

  Why not? 

  But if we guess ""penny"", and it's correct? We win? 
  If not? Then we know the third letter is not N? So it must be I or U? 

  Then we can guess either ""pinny"" or ""punny"" next? 

  Similarly, if we guess ""pinny"" first? 

  But we have two more guesses? So we can afford to try one? 

  Let's try ""penny"" because it is a very common word? 

  So I'll guess ""penny""

### Feedback Analysis from Previous Guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**:  
  - C(x), R(x), A(x) → Eliminated: C, R, A.  
  - N(✓) → N is at position 4.  
  - E(-) → E is in the word but not at position 5.  
- **Guess 2 (""spent"")**:  
  - S(x), T(x) → Eliminated: S, T.  
  - P(-) → P is in the word but not at position 2.  
  - E(-) → E is not at position 3.  
  - N(✓) → Confirms N at position 4.  
- **Guess 3 (""peony"")**:  
  - P(✓) → P is at position 1.  
  - E(✓) → E is at position 2.  
  - O(x) → Eliminated: O.  
  - N(✓) → Confirms N at position 4.  
  - Y(✓) → Y is at position 5.  

### Key Insights:
- **Secret word structure**: `P E _ N Y` (positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 confirmed).  
- **Unknown**: Only position 3 is missing.  
- **Eliminated letters**: A, C, R, S, T, O.  
- **Possible letters for position 3**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (and N, since duplicates are possible).  
- **Candidate words** (valid English words fitting `P E _ N Y`):  
  - `PENNY` (third letter = N).  
  - `PINNY` (third letter = I).  
  - `PUNNY` (third letter = U).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Goal**: Solve the word by testing the most common candidate, `PENNY`, which uses N (a known letter) and maximizes the chance of an immediate win.  
- **Why ""penny""?**  
  - If correct, the game ends.  
  - If incorrect, feedback will:  
    - Confirm N is not at position 3 (narrowing to `PINNY` or `PUNNY`).  
    - Provide no new eliminations (since N is already confirmed present).  

<guess>penny</guess>",penny,"We have the feedback from the third guess ""peony"":
  P(✓) E(✓) O(x) N(✓) Y(✓)

This means:
  P is correct at position 1.
  E is correct at position 2.
  O is absent (not in the word).
  N is correct at position 4 (already known).
  Y is correct at position 5.

So the secret word is: P E _ N Y

We know the first, second, fourth, and fifth letters: P, E, N, Y.
We are missing the third letter.

The secret word is: P E ? N Y

We also know from previous feedback:
  - The word does not contain: A, C, R, S, T, O (from the feedback of the three guesses).
  - We have used: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, T, O, Y.

The third letter must be a letter that hasn't been eliminated and is not in the list of absent letters.

Eliminated letters (absent): A, C, R, S, T, O.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need to find a 5-letter word of the form ""PE?NY"" that is a valid English word and uses one of the available letters.

Let's list possible words:

- ""PENNY"": But we have N at the fourth and fifth? No, the word is P E ? N Y. So the fifth is Y, not N. So ""penny"" would be P E N N Y? But that has two N's? And the third letter would be N? But we don't know if N can be duplicated? However, the feedback for ""peony"" had N at fourth and fifth? Wait, no: in ""peony"", we have N at fourth and Y at fifth? And we got Y(✓) at fifth? So the secret word has Y at fifth? So ""penny"" would be P E N N Y? But that has N at third? And we don't know if that's allowed? But the feedback for ""spent"" had N at fourth? And we didn't have a third N? So it's possible? But let's check the feedback for ""peony"": we got N(✓) at fourth? So the secret has N at fourth? And Y at fifth? So the third letter is not N? Because if it were, then in ""peony"" we didn't have a third N? So we don't know? Actually, the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we haven't encountered any duplicate feedback? 

But note: in the first guess ""crane"", we had one N? And it was at fourth? And in the secret word, we have N at fourth? And in ""spent"", we had N at fourth? And in ""peony"", we had N at fourth? So we don't have information about a duplicate N? 

However, the word ""penny"" has two N's? But the secret word is P E ? N Y? So the third letter is the only missing? And the fourth is N? So if the third letter is N? Then the word is P E N N Y? That is ""penny"" with a Y at the end? But that's not a word? The word ""penny"" is P-E-N-N-Y? So the fifth letter is Y? But in our pattern, the fifth letter is Y? So ""penny"" fits? 

But is ""penny"" a valid word? Yes, it is.

But let's check the letters: 
  P, E, N, N, Y.

But we have two N's? And we know the secret word has at least one N at the fourth? But it might have another? 

But in the feedback for ""peony"": 
  We guessed ""peony"": P, E, O, N, Y.
  The secret word is P E ? N Y.
  If the secret word is ""penny"", then:
      Position 1: P (✓) -> correct.
      Position 2: E (✓) -> correct.
      Position 3: O vs N? The secret has N at position 3? But we guessed O? So O is not in the word? And we got O(x) which is correct? Because O is absent? 
      Position 4: N (✓) -> correct.
      Position 5: Y (✓) -> correct.

  So it matches? 

But we also have to check if ""penny"" uses any eliminated letter? It uses P, E, N, Y? And N is duplicated? But the eliminated letters are A,C,R,S,T,O? So no conflict.

But is there any other word? 

Other possibilities for the third letter? 

We need a word: P E ? N Y, where ? is a letter from the available set: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

What words exist?
  - ""penny"": with ? = N -> but N is not in the available set? Because we haven't eliminated N? But we know N is in the word? But we are allowed to use it again? 

But the available set I listed was the letters that haven't been eliminated? But N is present? So we can use it? 

But let me list all possible words:

  ""peony"" is already guessed? And not the secret? Because we got O absent? 

  Other words:
    ""penny"": P E N N Y -> valid.
    ""peeny"": not common? 
    ""peiny"": not a word?
    ""pewny"": not a word?

  ""pesky"": but S is eliminated? 

  ""pelfy"": not common? 

  ""perky"": but R is eliminated? 

  ""pesty"": but S and T eliminated? 

  ""peggy"": G? That might be? P E G N Y? But that's not a word? Because the fourth letter is N? So it would be P E G N Y? Is that a word? I don't think so? 

  ""pigmy"": P I G M Y -> but that doesn't have N at fourth? 

  We must have the pattern: P E ? N Y.

  So the only common word I can think of is ""penny"".

But let me confirm: 
  ""penny"" is P-E-N-N-Y? 
  Positions: 
      1: P
      2: E
      3: N
      4: N
      5: Y

  But in our pattern, the fourth letter is N? And the fifth is Y? So it matches? 

  And the third letter is N? 

  But we have to check if the feedback from previous guesses allows duplicate N? 

  In the first guess ""crane"": we had one N at fourth? And it was correct? But the secret word ""penny"" has two N's? So when we guessed ""crane"", we only got one N marked? But that's because we only provided one N? 

  The feedback for ""crane"": 
      C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(-)
  The secret ""penny"" has two N's? But we only guessed one N? So the feedback would mark the N at the correct position? And since there is another N? But we didn't guess it? So it doesn't show? 

  Similarly, in ""spent"": 
      S(x), P(-), E(-), N(✓), T(x)
  We guessed N at fourth? Correct? And there is another N at third? But we didn't guess a letter at third? So it doesn't affect? 

  And in ""peony"": 
      P(✓), E(✓), O(x), N(✓), Y(✓)
  We guessed N at fourth? Correct? And the third letter we guessed O? Which is absent? So no issue? 

  So ""penny"" is a valid possibility? 

But are there other words? 

  ""jiffy""? Not matching pattern.

  ""pinky"": P I N K Y -> but that would be P at1, I at2, N at3, K at4, Y at5? But we need the fourth letter to be N? So if the secret were ""pinky"", then the fourth letter is K? But we know the fourth letter is N? So not.

  Similarly, ""pinny"": P I N N Y -> 
      This is a word? Meaning a type of apron? Or a variant? 
      Pattern: P(1), I(2), N(3), N(4), Y(5) -> 
      So the fourth letter is N? And fifth is Y? 
      So it fits the pattern? 

  But we have two words: ""penny"" and ""pinny""? 

  Also, ""punny"": P U N N Y -> meaning something that is a pun? 
      Pattern: P(1), U(2), N(3), N(4), Y(5) -> also fits.

  And ""funny""? But F at first? 

  So possible words: 
      ""penny"" (if the third letter is E? But no: the second is E? So third is N? So ""penny"")
      ""pinny"" (third letter I)
      ""punny"" (third letter U)

  But we also have to check the eliminated letters? 

  Eliminated: A, C, R, S, T, O.

  So for ""pinny"": I is not eliminated? 
      ""pinny"": P I N N Y -> I is available? 
  ""punny"": U is available? 

  So we have three candidates: 
      ""penny"", ""pinny"", ""punny""

  But note: we have to consider if the third letter can be N? 

  In the word ""penny"", the third letter is N? 

  How do we distinguish? 

  We need to make a guess that can identify which one it is? 

  But we are on the fourth guess? We have two more guesses? 

  Alternatively, we can guess one of them? 

  But let's see what we know? 

  We haven't tested I or U? 

  So we can try a word that includes I and U? But we only have one letter to guess? 

  Actually, the secret word is one of: 
      ""penny"", ""pinny"", ""punny""

  We can try a word that is not of the form P E ? N Y? But that would be inefficient? 

  Since we have three possibilities, we can try one? 

  But note: we have to use a valid word? 

  Alternatively, we can try a word that has I and U? But we don't have to? 

  Since we are missing only the third letter? And we have three options? We can try ""pinny"" for example? 

  But if we guess ""pinny"", and it's not the secret? Then we get feedback? 

  Similarly, we can try ""penny""? 

  But let's think: we have not used I or U? So we don't know if they are present? 

  However, in the secret word, the only unknown letter is the third? And it can be N, I, or U? 

  But note: if the third letter is N, then the word is ""penny""? 
  If it is I, then ""pinny""? 
  If it is U, then ""punny""? 

  So we can try ""penny"" as a guess? 

  Why not? 

  But if we guess ""penny"", and it's correct? We win? 
  If not? Then we know the third letter is not N? So it must be I or U? 

  Then we can guess either ""pinny"" or ""punny"" next? 

  Similarly, if we guess ""pinny"" first? 

  But we have two more guesses? So we can afford to try one? 

  Let's try ""penny"" because it is a very common word? 

  So I'll guess ""penny""

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**:  
  - C(x), R(x), A(x) → Eliminated: C, R, A.  
  - N(✓) → N is at position 4.  
  - E(-) → E is in the word but not at position 5.  
- **Guess 2 (""spent"")**:  
  - S(x), T(x) → Eliminated: S, T.  
  - P(-) → P is in the word but not at position 2.  
  - E(-) → E is not at position 3.  
  - N(✓) → Confirms N at position 4.  
- **Guess 3 (""peony"")**:  
  - P(✓) → P is at position 1.  
  - E(✓) → E is at position 2.  
  - O(x) → Eliminated: O.  
  - N(✓) → Confirms N at position 4.  
  - Y(✓) → Y is at position 5.  

### Key Insights:
- **Secret word structure**: `P E _ N Y` (positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 confirmed).  
- **Unknown**: Only position 3 is missing.  
- **Eliminated letters**: A, C, R, S, T, O.  
- **Possible letters for position 3**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (and N, since duplicates are possible).  
- **Candidate words** (valid English words fitting `P E _ N Y`):  
  - `PENNY` (third letter = N).  
  - `PINNY` (third letter = I).  
  - `PUNNY` (third letter = U).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Goal**: Solve the word by testing the most common candidate, `PENNY`, which uses N (a known letter) and maximizes the chance of an immediate win.  
- **Why ""penny""?**  
  - If correct, the game ends.  
  - If incorrect, feedback will:  
    - Confirm N is not at position 3 (narrowing to `PINNY` or `PUNNY`).  
    - Provide no new eliminations (since N is already confirmed present).",Guess 4: penny -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) E(✓) N(✓) N(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
