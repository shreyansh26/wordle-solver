We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"": 
 C: x -> not in the secret word
 R: x -> not in the secret word
 A: x -> not in the secret word
 N: x -> not in the secret word
 E: ✓ -> E is in the word and in the correct position.

 Since E is in the correct position and that position is the last one (5th letter), we know the secret word ends with E.

 Also, note that C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

 We need to make a second guess that must be a 5-letter word ending with E, and without the letters C, R, A, N.

 Let's think of words ending with E: 
 We also want to use new letters that haven't been tried to get more information.

 Previously used letters: C, R, A, N, E. We cannot use C, R, A, N again because they are absent.

 So, we must use letters from the remaining alphabet but including E at the end.

 The word must have E at position 5.

 Possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Since we need a 5-letter word ending in E, let's think of common ones.

 Some examples: 
 - like? L I K E -> but does not end with E? No, ""like"" ends with E? L-I-K-E -> yes, the 5th letter is E.

 However, note that we have to avoid A, C, R, N.

 For ""like"": L, I, K, E. None of these are forbidden? But we already know E is correct at the 5th position.

 But let me double-check: The feedback tells us that in the first word ""crane"", E is correct at the 5th position. So the secret word ends with E.

 Now, we can try words that have E at the end and don't have any of the forbidden letters.

 Let me list some: 
  - style: S, T, Y, L, E -> no A, C, R, N, so it's possible.
  - while: W, H, I, L, E -> also acceptable.
  - smile: S, M, I, L, E -> acceptable.

 However, we also want to cover common letters to gain information.

 Since we don't know the first four letters, we should choose a word with diverse letters.

 Also, note that the first guess had all distinct letters, and we should ideally use distinct letters again to maximize information.

 Let me look at letters that are common: among vowels we have to avoid A (and we have E already) but I, O, U are still available. Consonants: S, T, L, etc.

 One classic second word after ""crane"" in Wordle-like games might be ""stole"" but wait: O is still available? Yes.

 But note: we cannot use R? Because R was in the first word and got an 'x', meaning it's not in the word. So ""stole"" has R? No: ""stole"" is S-T-O-L-E -> no R.

 But wait: the word ""stole"" is S, T, O, L, E. All these are not forbidden? But what about the missing letters? We know A, C, N, R are forbidden? Only those.

 So ""stole"" is possible? Let me check: 
   S: new
   T: new
   O: new
   L: new
   E: at end -> fixed.

 But note: we are not required to avoid the previous correct letter? We have E at the end, so we must use E again at the end.

 However, we are allowed to reuse the letter that is known to be in the word? Actually, we know E is in, but we are using it again at the same position? That's fine.

 Since E is known, we can focus on the first four.

 Alternatively, we might avoid reusing E? But we haven't tried new letters? Since E is fixed at the end, every guess must have E at the 5th position until we change? Actually, we can try words without E at the end? But then we would lose the guaranteed correct letter? 

 However, note the feedback: E was marked as ✓ meaning it is in the word and in the correct position. Therefore, in the secret word, the fifth letter is E. Therefore, every guess must have E at the fifth position? Not necessarily? 

 Actually, we could guess words without E at the fifth position? But if we do that, we would get an 'x' for the fifth letter? And we know E is at the fifth position. Therefore, to avoid wasting a guess, we should keep E at the fifth position? 

 Alternatively, we can test whether E appears elsewhere? But we know E is at the fifth position, so it cannot appear elsewhere? Or can it? This depends on the rules. In Wordle, if a letter appears only once, and you put two, one might get marked as absent? But the feedback is per letter. However, in this case, we know the fifth letter is E, so even if we put E in another position, the secret word may not have a second E? 

 Since we have limited guesses, it's better to fix the known E at the fifth position and try to find other letters.

 We'll look for words ending with E.

 But note: we are only forbidden from using C, R, A, N. Also, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Consider the word ""stole"": S, T, O, L, E -> all new.

 But are there any other words that might cover more common letters?

 Another common word is ""smile"": S, M, I, L, E.

 But let's compare:

  ""stole"": uses S, T, O, L
  ""smile"": uses S, M, I, L

 We also have words like ""guide"": G, U, I, D, E -> but U and I are vowels.

 Alternatively, ""while"": W, H, I, L, E -> includes H and W which are less common.

 How about ""slate""? But S-L-A-T-E -> A is forbidden. So no.

 Or ""spite"": S-P-I-T-E -> P is acceptable? Yes.

 But I like ""stole"" because it includes common consonants (S, T, L) and a vowel (O).

 However, note that in the first guess we had E at the fifth position. The secret word does not contain A, C, R, N. So our second guess should avoid those and use E at the fifth.

 After considering, I choose ""stole"".

 Let me confirm: 
   S: new, 
   T: new, 
   O: new, 
   L: new, 
   E: known.

 We'll get feedback on S, T, O, L in positions 1 to 4.

 So, our next guess is ""stole"".

<guess>stole</guess>
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:
- The letter E is in the correct position at the end (5th letter) of the secret word.
- The letters C, R, A, and N are not in the secret word at all.

For the next guess, I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with E
2. Does not contain C, R, A, or N
3. Uses new letters to maximize information (ideally common consonants/vowels)

After evaluating options, **""stole""** fits well:
- Ends with E (fixed requirement)
- Avoids forbidden letters (C/R/A/N)
- Introduces new common letters: S, T, O, L

Thought process:
- Starting point: Secret word ends with E
- Focus on words like _ _ _ _ E
- Strong candidates: style, smile, while, stole
- ""stole"" chosen for better letter coverage (S/T/O/L) without wasting slots
