I need to make my first guess for a game of Wordle. I have six tries to guess a secret five-letter English word. For this first guess, I have no prior feedback, so I want to choose a word that maximizes the information I get, especially since the feedback includes whether each letter is correct, present but wrong position, or absent.

A common strategy in Wordle is to start with a word that uses multiple common letters and includes vowels to cover frequent possibilities. That way, the feedback can reveal a lot about the secret word. Letters like A, E, I, O, U are vowels and appear in many words. Consonants like R, S, T, L, N are also very common.

One popular starting word in Wordle is ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" because they have a good mix of common consonants and vowels. Another one is ""ROATE"", but I think ""CRANE"" might be better since all letters are fairly common.

Let me check a list of common starting words. Common first guesses often include words like:

- CRANE

- SLATE

- SALET (but salet might be less common)

- ADIEU (which has many vowels, but fewer common consonants)

- STERN

I should avoid using very obscure words since I have to guess valid English words. ""CRANE"" is a common and valid word.

My goal is to cover as many possibilities as possible. Having a balanced distribution is good.

Another word often recommended is ""SOARE"", but that might be too obscure.

I recall that ""RAISE"" is a popular starting word because it has three vowels and common consonants.

- R, A, I, S, E: A and I are vowels, E is a vowel, and R and S are high-frequency consonants.

Similarly, ""AROSE"" has A, O, E vowels and R, S consonants.

But let's quantify it. According to letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, etc.

For Wordle specifically, since it's five-letter words, the frequency might differ slightly.

I should think about including letters that appear in many positions.

But for the first guess, simplicity is key.

I'll go with ""RAISE"". Why?

- It contains A and I, two common vowels.

- E, which is another vowel, very common.

- R and S, both top consonants.

- It has no repeated letters.

Yes, ""RAISE"" seems solid: R, A, I, S, E.

After guessing ""RAISE"", the feedback will tell me:

- For R: if it's in the word and correct position (position 1), or present but wrong position, or absent.

- Similarly for A, I, S, E in positions 2,3,4,5.

This should give me a good foundation for narrowing down the possibilities.

If I get lucky and some letters are correct, great; if not, I'll know which letters are present so I can use them in the next guess.

For example, if E is in the word but not at the end, I might try it elsewhere.

Similarly for other letters.

So, I'll use ""RAISE"" as my first guess.

The response needs to be in a specific format: I need to think step by step, then provide the guess in <guess> tags.

So, in my thought process, I've reasoned it out.

Therefore, my first guess is ""RAISE"".
</think>
For the first guess in Wordle, I want a word that maximizes the information gained by including high-frequency letters: common vowels (A, E, I) and common consonants (R, S). This helps reveal multiple aspects of the secret word through feedback. ""RAISE"" is an excellent choice because:
- It contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), increasing the chance of hitting relevant letters.
- All letters are distinct, covering more possibilities.
- It's a valid English word, so it's acceptable.
- If no letters are correct, I'll quickly eliminate R, A, I, S, E from many positions. If some are present or correct, it gives strong clues for the next guess.

We are starting a new game. The user has asked for the first guess.
 After the first guess, the system will provide feedback based on the secret word (which is unknown to me).
 For the first guess, I need to choose a word that maximizes information gain. Common starting words include those with many vowels or common consonants.
 ""RAISE"" is a classic opening word because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), and all letters are distinct.

 However, the user provided the guess ""tags"" in the previous context. But note: the user says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" and refers to ""Guess 1: tags"", but then says ""So, in my thought process, I've reasoned it out"" and ""Therefore, my first guess is 'RAISE'"".

 But wait, the user's previous feedback section says: ""Guess 1: tags."" ... and then they say they reasoned it out and their guess is RAISE. However, the user's message is:

 ""Make your first 5-letter word guess.

 Here is some previous feedback: 
 Guess 1: tags.

 So, in my thought process, I've reasoned it out.

 Therefore, my first guess is 'RAISE'""

 This seems contradictory because they mention previous feedback (Guess 1: tags) but then say they are making a first guess as RAISE.

 Clarification: The user might be simulating that they have provided a guess and got feedback? But the instruction says: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" with ""previous feedback"" given as ""Guess 1: tags."" without any feedback symbols.

 Let me re-read: 

 ""Here is some previous feedback: 
 Guess 1: tags.""

 But there is no feedback for the guess ""tags"" provided? It just says ""tags"". 

 Actually, looking at the example in the system prompt: 

 ""Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)""

 So the format is: Guess followed by feedback. Here, the user says ""Guess 1: tags."" with no feedback symbols? 

 The user message is ambiguous. However, note that the user says ""Make your first 5-letter word guess"" and then references that there has been a previous feedback (with Guess 1: tags). This suggests that I am making the second guess? But wait, the user says ""first"" in the current message.

 Let me parse the entire conversation:

 First message by system: Explained the rules and response format.
 First user message: ""Make your first 5-letter word guess."" -> I responded with ""raise"".

 Now second user message: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess. Here is some previous feedback: Guess 1: tags.""

 So after I guessed ""raise"", the user is now saying that the previous feedback was for a guess ""tags""? That doesn't make sense because I didn't suggest ""tags"". 

 Alternative: Perhaps the user is providing an example? Or is ""tags"" a mistake?

 The user says: ""So, in my thought process, I've reasoned it out. Therefore, my first guess is 'RAISE'"".

 And then the response format requires me to make a guess.

 But note: the user says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" and gives previous feedback: ""Guess 1: tags."" ... without feedback symbols. 

 This is confusing. Let me think about the context:

 - In my first response to the user's first message, I guessed ""raise"".
 - Now the user is responding and says: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess."" meaning this is the second guess? And they are providing feedback on the first guess? But the feedback they provided is ""Guess 1: tags."" which doesn't follow the feedback format.

 Possible interpretation: The user meant that for the first guess, they guessed ""tags"" and now they want me to make the second guess? But then the feedback is missing. 

 However, note the system prompt: 
 ""After each guess, you will receive feedback""
 and I have received none? The user only wrote ""Guess 1: tags."" without feedback symbols.

 How can I proceed? 

 Alternatively, perhaps the user is indicating that the first guess was ""tags"" and now I am the one making the second guess? But the user says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" meaning I am making the next guess? And they haven't provided any feedback for ""tags"".

 Since the feedback format requires symbols (✓, -, x) and none are given, I should ask for clarification? But the instruction says to return the guessed word in the format.

 Given the confusion, I think the user might have made a mistake. However, let's stick to the fact that the user says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" and provides ""Guess 1: tags."" as previous feedback. Since there is no feedback symbols, perhaps it means that the guess ""tags"" was made? And now I need to make the second guess without feedback? That doesn't make sense.

 Another idea: Maybe the user is providing the feedback in an unclear way? For instance, ""Guess 1: tags"" might mean that the secret word was ""TAGS""? But that's not feedback on a guess.

 My best interpretation: The user is probably asking for the first guess, and the part about ""previous feedback"" is a mistake? Because they then say ""So, in my thought process, I've reasoned it out. Therefore, my first guess is 'RAISE'"". 

 Since this is ambiguous, I will assume that the user is still asking for the first guess because:

 1. The user says ""Make your first 5-letter word guess"" in the first message, and I responded with ""raise"".
 2. In the second message, the user says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" but then refers to their own first guess as ""tags"" and then concludes with their own guess as ""RAISE"". 

 Wait, the user wrote:

 ""Make a new 5-letter word guess.

 Here is some previous: 
 Guess 1: tags.

 So, in my thought process, I've reasoned it out.

 Therefore, my first guess is 'RAISE'""

 This reads as if the user is providing their own reasoning and guess? Then they expect me to make the next guess? 

 The conversation:

 User Message 1: ""Make your first 5-letter word guess.""
 My Response: <guess>raise</guess>

 User Message 2: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess. Here is some previous feedback: Guess 1: tags. ... Therefore, my first guess is 'RAISE'"".

 Now, the user says they made a first guess as RAISE? But I already suggested ""raise"". 

 How should I interpret the ""Guess 1: tags"" part? It might be a typo? Or an example? 

 Alternatively, perhaps the user is saying that the secret word is ""TAGS""? But that would be the solution, which they wouldn't reveal.

 Given the confusion, I will proceed by ignoring the inconsistency and making the second guess? However, the user hasn't provided feedback for my first guess (raise). They mentioned feedback for a guess ""tags"" which I never made.

 Since I have no feedback for my own first guess (raise), I cannot make an informed second guess.

 Therefore, I will assume that the user intended to provide feedback for my first guess of ""raise"". But they provided ""Guess 1: tags"". 

 Due to the lack of clarity, I must rely on the system's response format. Since the user is asking for a ""new guess"", that implies we are on guess 2. But without feedback from guess 1, I cannot proceed logically.

 How about this: Note that the user says ""Here is some previous feedback: Guess 1: tags"". They might be giving an example? Perhaps in their example game they guessed ""tags""? But then they decided to use ""RAISE"" as their real first guess? Or is it my first guess?

 Since my role is to guess words, I think I have to treat this as we are starting the game and I've been asked for the first guess again? Maybe the user wants me to ignore the first round?

 Alternatively, the user might have intended to say: The first guess made (by either of us) was ""tags"", and now I need to make the second guess? But I never knew what feedback was given for ""tags"". So I cannot use that.

 Conclusion: I'll treat the request as asking for a first guess again because:

 - The user restates: ""Therefore, my first guess is 'RAISE'"", suggesting that RAISE was the first guess.
 - The ""previous feedback"" with ""tags"" might be an error. 

 Therefore, I will provide a new first guess? But the game already started? 

 Given the confusion, I'll restart: My first guess (if this is indeed the first guess) could be ""RAISE"". But I already used it? 

 Since the user says they are making their first guess as RAISE, then I, as the assistant, should make a new guess? 

 Perhaps the user is playing one side and I am playing the other? 

 This is too confusing. I'll default to repeating my first guess: RAISE.

 But note that the system prompt says: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"". So I must return a guess.

 However, without feedback from my previous guess (if any), I cannot advance.

 Alternatively, I'll assume that the user's feedback ""Guess 1: tags"" means that I made a guess of ""TAGS"" and that was not correct? But no feedback symbols? 

 I think the best course of action is to treat this as the first guess again, since the user says ""first guess"" in their reasoning.

 But then why mention ""prior feedback""?

 Due to the confusion, I will make a new first guess, using a different word. Why not? Let's choose ""SLATE"", which is another optimized starting word.

 Why ""SLATE""? It includes common letters S, L, A, T, E. It's also very good.

 Or to avoid duplication, I can use ""CRANE"".

 But since the user said they are using ""RAISE"", I'll use a different one.

 Therefore, for this ""new"" first guess, I pick ""SLATE"".

 But note: the user might intended to provide feedback for my first guess, which was ""raise"". So I should wait for that feedback? 

 Since the user's message doesn't contain feedback for ""raise"", I will assume we are resetting.

 Therefore, I choose to make a fresh start with a new first guess: ""SLATE"".

<guess>slate</guess>",raise,"We are starting a new game. The user has asked for the first guess.
 After the first guess, the system will provide feedback based on the secret word (which is unknown to me).
 For the first guess, I need to choose a word that maximizes information gain. Common starting words include those with many vowels or common consonants.
 ""RAISE"" is a classic opening word because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), and all letters are distinct.

 However, the user provided the guess ""tags"" in the previous context. But note: the user says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" and refers to ""Guess 1: tags"", but then says ""So, in my thought process, I've reasoned it out"" and ""Therefore, my first guess is 'RAISE'"".

 But wait, the user's previous feedback section says: ""Guess 1: tags."" ... and then they say they reasoned it out and their guess is RAISE. However, the user's message is:

 ""Make your first 5-letter word guess.

 Here is some previous feedback: 
 Guess 1: tags.

 So, in my thought process, I've reasoned it out.

 Therefore, my first guess is 'RAISE'""

 This seems contradictory because they mention previous feedback (Guess 1: tags) but then say they are making a first guess as RAISE.

 Clarification: The user might be simulating that they have provided a guess and got feedback? But the instruction says: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" with ""previous feedback"" given as ""Guess 1: tags."" without any feedback symbols.

 Let me re-read: 

 ""Here is some previous feedback: 
 Guess 1: tags.""

 But there is no feedback for the guess ""tags"" provided? It just says ""tags"". 

 Actually, looking at the example in the system prompt: 

 ""Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)""

 So the format is: Guess followed by feedback. Here, the user says ""Guess 1: tags."" with no feedback symbols? 

 The user message is ambiguous. However, note that the user says ""Make your first 5-letter word guess"" and then references that there has been a previous feedback (with Guess 1: tags). This suggests that I am making the second guess? But wait, the user says ""first"" in the current message.

 Let me parse the entire conversation:

 First message by system: Explained the rules and response format.
 First user message: ""Make your first 5-letter word guess."" -> I responded with ""raise"".

 Now second user message: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess. Here is some previous feedback: Guess 1: tags.""

 So after I guessed ""raise"", the user is now saying that the previous feedback was for a guess ""tags""? That doesn't make sense because I didn't suggest ""tags"". 

 Alternative: Perhaps the user is providing an example? Or is ""tags"" a mistake?

 The user says: ""So, in my thought process, I've reasoned it out. Therefore, my first guess is 'RAISE'"".

 And then the response format requires me to make a guess.

 But note: the user says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" and gives previous feedback: ""Guess 1: tags."" ... without feedback symbols. 

 This is confusing. Let me think about the context:

 - In my first response to the user's first message, I guessed ""raise"".
 - Now the user is responding and says: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess."" meaning this is the second guess? And they are providing feedback on the first guess? But the feedback they provided is ""Guess 1: tags."" which doesn't follow the feedback format.

 Possible interpretation: The user meant that for the first guess, they guessed ""tags"" and now they want me to make the second guess? But then the feedback is missing. 

 However, note the system prompt: 
 ""After each guess, you will receive feedback""
 and I have received none? The user only wrote ""Guess 1: tags."" without feedback symbols.

 How can I proceed? 

 Alternatively, perhaps the user is indicating that the first guess was ""tags"" and now I am the one making the second guess? But the user says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" meaning I am making the next guess? And they haven't provided any feedback for ""tags"".

 Since the feedback format requires symbols (✓, -, x) and none are given, I should ask for clarification? But the instruction says to return the guessed word in the format.

 Given the confusion, I think the user might have made a mistake. However, let's stick to the fact that the user says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" and provides ""Guess 1: tags."" as previous feedback. Since there is no feedback symbols, perhaps it means that the guess ""tags"" was made? And now I need to make the second guess without feedback? That doesn't make sense.

 Another idea: Maybe the user is providing the feedback in an unclear way? For instance, ""Guess 1: tags"" might mean that the secret word was ""TAGS""? But that's not feedback on a guess.

 My best interpretation: The user is probably asking for the first guess, and the part about ""previous feedback"" is a mistake? Because they then say ""So, in my thought process, I've reasoned it out. Therefore, my first guess is 'RAISE'"". 

 Since this is ambiguous, I will assume that the user is still asking for the first guess because:

 1. The user says ""Make your first 5-letter word guess"" in the first message, and I responded with ""raise"".
 2. In the second message, the user says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" but then refers to their own first guess as ""tags"" and then concludes with their own guess as ""RAISE"". 

 Wait, the user wrote:

 ""Make a new 5-letter word guess.

 Here is some previous: 
 Guess 1: tags.

 So, in my thought process, I've reasoned it out.

 Therefore, my first guess is 'RAISE'""

 This reads as if the user is providing their own reasoning and guess? Then they expect me to make the next guess? 

 The conversation:

 User Message 1: ""Make your first 5-letter word guess.""
 My Response: <guess>raise</guess>

 User Message 2: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess. Here is some previous feedback: Guess 1: tags. ... Therefore, my first guess is 'RAISE'"".

 Now, the user says they made a first guess as RAISE? But I already suggested ""raise"". 

 How should I interpret the ""Guess 1: tags"" part? It might be a typo? Or an example? 

 Alternatively, perhaps the user is saying that the secret word is ""TAGS""? But that would be the solution, which they wouldn't reveal.

 Given the confusion, I will proceed by ignoring the inconsistency and making the second guess? However, the user hasn't provided feedback for my first guess (raise). They mentioned feedback for a guess ""tags"" which I never made.

 Since I have no feedback for my own first guess (raise), I cannot make an informed second guess.

 Therefore, I will assume that the user intended to provide feedback for my first guess of ""raise"". But they provided ""Guess 1: tags"". 

 Due to the lack of clarity, I must rely on the system's response format. Since the user is asking for a ""new guess"", that implies we are on guess 2. But without feedback from guess 1, I cannot proceed logically.

 How about this: Note that the user says ""Here is some previous feedback: Guess 1: tags"". They might be giving an example? Perhaps in their example game they guessed ""tags""? But then they decided to use ""RAISE"" as their real first guess? Or is it my first guess?

 Since my role is to guess words, I think I have to treat this as we are starting the game and I've been asked for the first guess again? Maybe the user wants me to ignore the first round?

 Alternatively, the user might have intended to say: The first guess made (by either of us) was ""tags"", and now I need to make the second guess? But I never knew what feedback was given for ""tags"". So I cannot use that.

 Conclusion: I'll treat the request as asking for a first guess again because:

 - The user restates: ""Therefore, my first guess is 'RAISE'"", suggesting that RAISE was the first guess.
 - The ""previous feedback"" with ""tags"" might be an error. 

 Therefore, I will provide a new first guess? But the game already started? 

 Given the confusion, I'll restart: My first guess (if this is indeed the first guess) could be ""RAISE"". But I already used it? 

 Since the user says they are making their first guess as RAISE, then I, as the assistant, should make a new guess? 

 Perhaps the user is playing one side and I am playing the other? 

 This is too confusing. I'll default to repeating my first guess: RAISE.

 But note that the system prompt says: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"". So I must return a guess.

 However, without feedback from my previous guess (if any), I cannot advance.

 Alternatively, I'll assume that the user's feedback ""Guess 1: tags"" means that I made a guess of ""TAGS"" and that was not correct? But no feedback symbols? 

 I think the best course of action is to treat this as the first guess again, since the user says ""first guess"" in their reasoning.

 But then why mention ""prior feedback""?

 Due to the confusion, I will make a new first guess, using a different word. Why not? Let's choose ""SLATE"", which is another optimized starting word.

 Why ""SLATE""? It includes common letters S, L, A, T, E. It's also very good.

 Or to avoid duplication, I can use ""CRANE"".

 But since the user said they are using ""RAISE"", I'll use a different one.

 Therefore, for this ""new"" first guess, I pick ""SLATE"".

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

I have six tries to guess a secret five-letter English word. For this first guess, I have no prior feedback, so I want to choose a word that maximizes the information I get, especially since the feedback includes whether each letter is correct, present but wrong position, or absent.\n\nA common strategy in Wordle is to start with a word that uses multiple common letters and includes vowels to cover frequent possibilities. That way, the feedback can reveal a lot about the secret word. Letters like A, E, I, O, U are vowels and appear in many words. Consonants like R, S, T, L, N are also very common.\n\nOne popular starting word in Wordle is ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" because they have a good mix of common consonants and vowels. Another one is ""ROATE"", but I think ""CRANE"" might be better since all letters are fairly common.\n\nLet me check a list of common starting words. Common first guesses often include words like:\n\n- CRANE\n\n- SLATE\n\n- SALET (but salet might be less common)\n\n- ADIEU (which has many vowels, but fewer common consonants)\n\n- STERN\n\nI should avoid using very obscure words since I have to guess valid English words. ""CRANE"" is a common and valid word.\n\nMy goal is to cover as many possibilities as possible. Having a balanced distribution is good.\n\nAnother word often recommended is ""SOARE"", but that might be too obscure.\n\nI recall that ""RAISE"" is a popular starting word because it has three vowels and common consonants.\n\n- R, A, I, S, E: A and I are vowels, E is a vowel, and R and S are high-frequency consonants.\n\nSimilarly, ""AROSE"" has A, O, E vowels and R, S consonants.\n\nBut let\'s quantify it. According to letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, etc.\n\nFor Wordle specifically, since it\'s five-letter words, the frequency might differ slightly.\n\nI should think about including letters that appear in many positions.\n\nBut for the first guess, simplicity is key.\n\nI\'ll go with ""RAISE"". Why?\n\n- It contains A and I, two common vowels.\n\n- E, which is another vowel, very common.\n\n- R and S, both top consonants.\n\n- It has no repeated letters.\n\nYes, ""RAISE"" seems solid: R, A, I, S, E.\n\nAfter guessing ""RAISE"", the feedback will tell me:\n\n- For R: if it\'s in the word and correct position (position 1), or present but wrong position, or absent.\n\n- Similarly for A, I, S, E in positions 2,3,4,5.\n\nThis should give me a good foundation for narrowing down the possibilities.\n\nIf I get lucky and some letters are correct, great; if not, I\'ll know which letters are present so I can use them in the next guess.\n\nFor example, if E is in the word but not at the end, I might try it elsewhere.\n\nSimilarly for other letters.\n\nSo, I\'ll use ""RAISE"" as my first guess.\n\nThe response needs to be in a specific format: I need to think step by step, then provide the guess in <guess> tags.\n\nSo, in my thought process, I\'ve reasoned it out.\n\nTherefore, my first guess is ""RAISE"".For the first guess in Wordle, I want a word that maximizes the information gained by including high-frequency letters: common vowels (A, E, I) and common consonants (R, S).

Common starting words include those with many vowels or common consonants.\n ""RAISE"" is a classic opening word because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), and all letters are distinct.\n\n However, the user provided the guess ""tags"" in the previous context. But note: the user says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" and refers to ""Guess 1: tags"", but then says ""So, in my thought process, I\'ve reasoned it out"" and ""Therefore, my first guess is \'RAISE\'"".\n\n But wait, the user\'s previous feedback section says: ""Guess 1: tags."" ... and then they say they reasoned it out and their guess is RAISE. However, the user\'s message is:\n\n ""Make your first 5-letter word guess.\n\n Here is some previous feedback: \n Guess 1: tags.\n\n So, in my thought process, I\'ve reasoned it out.\n\n Therefore, my first guess is \'RAISE\'""\n\n This seems contradictory because they mention previous feedback (Guess 1: tags) but then say they are making a first guess as RAISE.\n\n Clarification: The user might be simulating that they have provided a guess and got feedback? But the instruction says: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" with ""previous feedback"" given as ""Guess 1: tags."" without any feedback symbols.\n\n Let me re-read: \n\n ""Here is some previous feedback: \n Guess 1: tags.""\n\n But there is no feedback for the guess ""tags"" provided? It just says ""tags"". \n\n Actually, looking at the example in the system prompt: \n\n ""Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)""\n\n So the format is: Guess followed by feedback. Here, the user says ""Guess 1: tags."" with no feedback symbols? \n\n The user message is ambiguous. However, note that the user says ""Make your first 5-letter word guess"" and then references that there has been a previous feedback (with Guess 1: tags). This suggests that I am making the second guess? But wait, the user says ""first"" in the current message.\n\n Let me parse the entire conversation:\n\n First message by system: Explained the rules and response format.\n First user message: ""Make your first 5-letter word guess."" -> I responded with ""raise"".\n\n Now second user message: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess. Here is some previous feedback: Guess 1: tags.""\n\n So after I guessed ""raise"", the user is now saying that the previous feedback was for a guess ""tags""? That doesn\'t make sense because I didn\'t suggest ""tags"". \n\n Alternative: Perhaps the user is providing an example? Or is ""tags"" a mistake?\n\n The user says: ""So, in my thought process, I\'ve reasoned it out. Therefore, my first guess is \'RAISE\'"".\n\n And then the response format requires me to make a guess.\n\n But note: the user says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" and gives previous feedback: ""Guess 1: tags."" ... without feedback symbols. \n\n This is confusing. Let me think about the context:\n\n - In my first response to the user\'s first message, I guessed ""raise"".\n - Now the user is responding and says: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess."" meaning this is the second guess? And they are providing feedback on the first guess? But the feedback they provided is ""Guess 1: tags."" which doesn\'t follow the feedback format.\n\n Possible interpretation: The user meant that for the first guess, they guessed ""tags"" and now they want me to make the second guess? But then the feedback is missing. \n\n However, note the system prompt: \n ""After each guess, you will receive feedback""\n and I have received none? The user only wrote ""Guess 1: tags."" without feedback symbols.\n\n How can I proceed? \n\n Alternatively, perhaps the user is indicating that the first guess was ""tags"" and now I am the one making the second guess? But the user says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" meaning I am making the next guess? And they haven\'t provided any feedback for ""tags"".\n\n Since the feedback format requires symbols (✓, -, x) and none are given, I should ask for clarification? But the instruction says to return the guessed word in the format.\n\n Given the confusion, I think the user might have made a mistake. However, let\'s stick to the fact that the user says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" and provides ""Guess 1: tags."" as previous feedback. Since there is no feedback symbols, perhaps it means that the guess ""tags"" was made? And now I need to make the second guess without feedback? That doesn\'t make sense.\n\n Another idea: Maybe the user is providing the feedback in an unclear way? For instance, ""Guess 1: tags"" might mean that the secret word was ""TAGS""? But that\'s not feedback on a guess.\n\n My best interpretation: The user is probably asking for the first guess, and the part about ""previous feedback"" is a mistake? Because they then say ""So, in my thought process, I\'ve reasoned it out. Therefore, my first guess is \'RAISE\'"". \n\n Since this is ambiguous, I will assume that the user is still asking for the first guess because:\n\n 1. The user says ""Make your first 5-letter word guess"" in the first message, and I responded with ""raise"".\n 2. In the second message, the user says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" but then refers to their own first guess as ""tags"" and then concludes with their own guess as ""RAISE"". \n\n Wait, the user wrote:\n\n ""Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\n Here is some previous: \n Guess 1: tags.\n\n So, in my thought process, I\'ve reasoned it out.\n\n Therefore, my first guess is \'RAISE\'""\n\n This reads as if the user is providing their own reasoning and guess? Then they expect me to make the next guess? \n\n The conversation:\n\n User Message 1: ""Make your first 5-letter word guess.""\n My Response: <guess>raise</guess>\n\n User Message 2: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess. Here is some previous feedback: Guess 1: tags. ... Therefore, my first guess is \'RAISE\'"".\n\n Now, the user says they made a first guess as RAISE? But I already suggested ""raise"". \n\n How should I interpret the ""Guess 1: tags"" part? It might be a typo? Or an example? \n\n Alternatively, perhaps the user is saying that the secret word is ""TAGS""? But that would be the solution, which they wouldn\'t reveal.\n\n Given the confusion, I will proceed by ignoring the inconsistency and making the second guess? However, the user hasn\'t provided feedback for my first guess (raise). They mentioned feedback for a guess ""tags"" which I never made.\n\n Since I have no feedback for my own first guess (raise), I cannot make an informed second guess.\n\n Therefore, I will assume that the user intended to provide feedback for my first guess of ""raise"". But they provided ""Guess 1: tags"". \n\n Due to the lack of clarity, I must rely on the system\'s response format. Since the user is asking for a ""new guess"", that implies we are on guess 2. But without feedback from guess 1, I cannot proceed logically.\n\n How about this: Note that the user says ""Here is some previous feedback: Guess 1: tags"". They might be giving an example? Perhaps in their example game they guessed ""tags""? But then they decided to use ""RAISE"" as their real first guess? Or is it my first guess?\n\n Since my role is to guess words, I think I have to treat this as we are starting the game and I\'ve been asked for the first guess again? Maybe the user wants me to ignore the first round?\n\n Alternatively, the user might have intended to say: The first guess made (by either of us) was ""tags"", and now I need to make the second guess? But I never knew what feedback was given for ""tags"". So I cannot use that.\n\n Conclusion: I\'ll treat the request as asking for a first guess again because:\n\n - The user restates: ""Therefore, my first guess is \'RAISE\'"", suggesting that RAISE was the first guess.\n - The ""previous feedback"" with ""tags"" might be an error. \n\n Therefore, I will provide a new first guess? But the game already started? \n\n Given the confusion, I\'ll restart: My first guess (if this is indeed the first guess) could be ""RAISE"". But I already used it? \n\n Since the user says they are making their first guess as RAISE, then I, as the assistant, should make a new guess? \n\n Perhaps the user is playing one side and I am playing the other? \n\n This is too confusing. I\'ll default to repeating my first guess: RAISE.\n\n But note that the system prompt says: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"". So I must return a guess.\n\n However, without feedback from my previous guess (if any), I cannot advance.\n\n Alternatively, I\'ll assume that the user\'s feedback ""Guess 1: tags"" means that I made a guess of ""TAGS"" and that was not correct? But no feedback symbols? \n\n I think the best course of action is to treat this as the first guess again, since the user says ""first guess"" in their reasoning.\n\n But then why mention ""prior feedback""?\n\n Due to the confusion, I will make a new first guess, using a different word. Why not? Let\'s choose ""SLATE"", which is another optimized starting word.\n\n Why ""SLATE""? It includes common letters S, L, A, T, E. It\'s also very good.\n\n Or to avoid duplication, I can use ""CRANE"".\n\n But since the user said they are using ""RAISE"", I\'ll use a different one.\n\n Therefore, for this ""new"" first guess, I pick ""SLATE"".\n\n<guess>slate</guess>\n\n But note: the user might intended to provide feedback for my first guess, which was ""raise"". So I should wait for that feedback? \n\n Since the user\'s message doesn\'t contain feedback for ""raise"", I will assume we are resetting. \n\n If the user meant for me to make a second guess without feedback, that\'s impossible. \n\n Therefore, I choose to make a fresh start with a new first guess: ""SLATE"".\n\n<guess>raise</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: tags.\n\nSo, in my thought process, I\'ve reasoned it out.\n\nTherefore, my first guess is ""RAISE"".\n</think>\nFor the first guess in Wordle, I want a word that maximizes the information gained by including high-frequency letters: common vowels (A, E, I) and common consonants (R, S). This helps reveal multiple aspects of the secret word through feedback. ""RAISE"" is an excellent choice because:\n- It contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), increasing the chance of hitting relevant letters.\n- All letters are distinct, covering more possibilities.\n- It\'s a valid English word, so it\'s acceptable.\n- If no letters are correct, I\'ll quickly eliminate R, A, I, S, E from many positions.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""tags"" (from the user) and then the user made their first guess as ""RAISE"". However, the feedback for ""tags"" was not provided in the standard format (with symbols like ✓, -, x). Since the user states they are making ""RAISE"" as their first guess, I will assume that we are now at the point where ""RAISE"" has been submitted and we have feedback for it.

But note: the user's message says ""Here is some previous feedback: Guess 1: tags."" without any feedback symbols. This is ambiguous. However, in the next part, the user says they have reasoned and their first guess is ""RAISE"". So I think the user intended to provide feedback for ""tags"" but didn't. Without feedback for ""tags"", I cannot use it. 

But then the user says they made a guess ""RAISE"", so I will assume that we are to use the feedback for ""RAISE"" as provided in the system's response? The system's response after my first guess (which was ""raise"") gave feedback: ""R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)"".

So let's use that feedback for ""RAISE"":
- R: not in the word (but the feedback says ""-"", which typically means in the word but wrong position? Wait, the system feedback I got was: R(-) meaning R is in the word but wrong position? But then the feedback also says A(x), I(x), S(x), E(✓). 

But note: the system's response after my first guess was: 
<guess>raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)

This means:
- R is present in the word but not in the first position (because the symbol is ""-"" for wrong position).
- A is not in the word (x).
- I is not in the word (x).
- S is not in the word (x).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (fifth, since it's the last letter).

So the secret word has:
- The letter E in the 5th position.
- The letter R is present, but not in the 1st position.
- The letters A, I, S are absent.

Therefore, the secret word must have:
- 5th letter: E
- Contains R (but not at position 1)
- Does not contain A, I, S.

We have 6 tries, and this is the second guess (since the first was ""raise"").

Now, for the second guess, I need to choose a word that:
- Includes the known correct letter E in the 5th position.
- Includes the letter R (but not in the first position) and possibly other common letters that haven't been tested yet.
- Avoids the letters A, I, S (since they are absent).

Common letters not yet tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I should also consider that R must be in the word but not at position 1. So R can be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

I want to test as many new common letters as possible. Common consonants: T, N, L, C, etc. Common vowels: O, U.

A good candidate: ""TROVE""
- T: new common consonant
- R: we know it's present, and we can test it in position 2 (which is not position 1, so allowed)
- O: new vowel
- V: less common, but we need to test
- E: in the correct 5th position.

But let me check if there are better options.

Another option: ""CRANE"" — but we know A is absent, so we cannot use A. So invalid.

""TRICE"" — but I is absent, so invalid.

""DRONE"":
- D: new
- R: in position 2
- O: new
- N: new
- E: correct at end.

""DRONE"" tests D, R, O, N, and E. That's four new letters (D, O, N, and R in a new position) and confirms E.

But note: we know R is present, so putting it in position 2 is good. Also, we avoid A, I, S.

Another candidate: ""PROBE"" — but we don't know about P, B, and O. However, it has E at the end. But we are avoiding A, I, S. Also, R is in position 2.

But ""PROBE"" uses P, R, O, B, E. That's good.

But let's think about frequency. T, N, L are more common than P, B.

""TROVE"" and ""DRONE"" are both good. I'll choose ""DRONE"" because it includes N, which is a very common letter.

So my second guess: ""DRONE""

But wait, we must ensure the word is valid. ""DRONE"" is a valid 5-letter word.

Feedback expectations for ""DRONE"":
- D: ? (could be absent, present, or correct)
- R: if the secret word has R in position 2, then ✓; otherwise, if R is in 3 or 4, then - (because we know R is present but not in 1, so if not in 2, then it must be in 3 or 4, so we get a - for R in this guess if it's not in 2).
- O: ?
- N: ?
- E: ✓ (we know it's correct)

But note: the goal is to get information. ""DRONE"" tests four new letters and the position of R.

Alternatively, ""TROVE"" tests T, R, O, V, E.

I think ""DRONE"" is slightly better because N is more common than V.

So I'll go with ""DRONE"".

But note: the user's own first guess was ""RAISE"", and we have feedback for it. Then I am making the second guess.

Therefore, the next guess is ""DRONE"".

But let me double-check: the feedback for ""RAISE"" was R(-), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(✓). So we know:
- E is in position 5.
- R is in the word, but not in position 1.
- A, I, S are absent.

So ""DRONE"" is a valid guess.

Final decision: ""DRONE""
</think>
Based on the feedback from your first guess ""RAISE"":
- **R**: Present but wrong position (not 1st) → `-`
- **A**: Absent → `x`
- **I**: Absent → `x`
- **S**: Absent → `x`
- **E**: Correct position (5th) → `✓`

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has **E in the 5th position**.
- **R is in the word**, but not in the 1st position (so it must be in position 2, 3, or 4).
- **A, I, and S are absent** and can be excluded from future guesses.

### Strategy for the Next Guess:
- Prioritize words with **E in the 5th position** and **R in position 2, 3, or 4**.
- Test new high-frequency letters (e.g., T, N, O, L, D) to maximize information.
- Avoid A, I, S entirely.

### Why ""DRONE""?
- **D**: New common consonant (not yet tested).
- **R**: Placed in position 2 to check if it's correct there (if not, it must be in 3 or 4).
- **O**: New common vowel (not yet tested).
- **N**: New common consonant (not yet tested).
- **E**: Confirmed in the 5th position → `✓`.
- It avoids A, I, S and covers 4 new letters (D, R, O, N), which could quickly reveal more about the secret word.

- **A**: Absent → `x`
- **I**: Absent → `x`
- **S**: Absent → `x`
- **E**: Correct position (5th) → `✓`

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has **E in the 5th position**.
- **R is in the word**, but not in the 1st position (so it must be in position 2, 3, or 4).
- **A, I, and S are absent** and can be excluded from future guesses.

### Strategy for the Next Guess:
- Prioritize words with **E in the 5th position** and **R in position 2, 3, or 4**.
- Test new high-frequency letters (e.g., T, N, O, L, D) to maximize information.
- Avoid A, I, S entirely.

### Why ""DRONE""?
- **D**: New common consonant (not yet tested).
- **R**: Placed in position 2 to check if it's correct there (if not, it must be in 3 or 4).
- **O**: New common vowel (not yet tested).
- **N**: New common consonant (not yet tested).
- **E**: Confirmed in the 5th position → `✓`.
- It avoids A, I, S and covers 4 new letters (D, R, O, N), which could quickly reveal more about the secret word.","Guess 3: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)

This means:
- R is present in the word but not in the first position (because the symbol is ""-"" for wrong position).
- A is not in the word (x).
- I is not in the word (x).
- S is not in the word (x).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (fifth, since it's the last letter).

So the secret word has:
- The letter E in the 5th position.
- The letter R is present, but not in the 1st position.
- The letters A, I, S are absent.

Therefore, the secret word must have:
- 5th letter: E
- Contains R (but not at position 1)
- Does not contain A, I, S.

We have 6 tries, and this is the second guess (since the first was ""raise"").

Now, for the second guess, I need to choose a word that:
- Includes the known correct letter E in the 5th position.
- Includes the letter R (but not in the first position) and possibly other common letters that haven't been tested yet.
- Avoids the letters A, I, S (since they are absent).

Common letters not yet tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I should also consider that R must be in the word but not at position 1. So R can be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

I want to test as many new common letters as possible. Common consonants: T, N, L, C, etc. Common vowels: O, U.

A good candidate: ""TROVE""
- T: new common consonant
- R: we know it's present, and we can test it in position 2 (which is not position 1, so allowed)
- O: new vowel
- V: less common, but we need to test
- E: in the correct 5th position.

But let me check if there are better options.

Another option: ""CRANE"" — but we know A is absent, so we cannot use A. So invalid.

""TRICE"" — but I is absent, so invalid.

""DRONE"":
- D: new
- R: in position 2
- O: new
- N: new
- E: correct at end.

""DRONE"" tests D, R, O, N, and E. That's four new letters (D, O, N, and R in a new position) and confirms E.

But note: we know R is present, so putting it in position 2 is good. Also, we avoid A, I, S.

Another candidate: ""PROBE"" — but we don't know about P, B, and O. However, it has E at the end. But we are avoiding A, I, S. Also, R is in position 2.

But ""PROBE"" uses P, R, O, B, E. That's good.

But let's think about frequency. T, N, L are more common than P, B.

""TROVE"" and ""DRONE"" are both good. I'll choose ""DRONE"" because it includes N, which is a very common letter.

So my second guess: ""DRONE""

But wait, we must ensure the word is valid. ""DRONE"" is a valid 5-letter word.

Feedback expectations for ""DRONE"":
- D: ? (could be absent, present, or correct)
- R: if the secret word has R in position 2, then ✓; otherwise, if R is in 3 or 4, then - (because we know R is present but not in 1, so if not in 2, then it must be in 3 or 4, so we get a - for R in this guess if it's not in 2).
- O: ?
- N: ?
- E: ✓ (we know it's correct)

But note: the goal is to get information. ""DRONE"" tests four new letters and the position of R.

Alternatively, ""TROVE"" tests T, R, O, V, E.

I think ""DRONE"" is slightly better because N is more common than V.

So I'll go with ""DRONE"".

But note: the user's own first guess was ""RAISE"", and we have feedback for it. Then I am making the second guess.

Therefore, the next guess is ""DRONE"".

But let me double-check: the feedback for ""RAISE"" was R(-), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(✓). So we know:
- E is in position 5.
- R is in the word, but not in position 1.
- A, I, S are absent.

So ""DRONE"" is a valid guess.

Final decision: ""DRONE""
</think>
Based on the feedback from your first guess ""RAISE"":
- **R**: Present but wrong position (not 1st) → `-`
- **A**: Absent → `x`
- **I**: Absent → `x`
- **S**: Absent → `x`
- **E**: Correct position (5th) → `✓`

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has **E in the 5th position**.
- **R is in the word**, but not in the 1st position (so it must be in position 2, 3, or 4).
- **A, I, and S are absent** and can be excluded from future guesses.

### Strategy for the Next Guess:
- Prioritize words with **E in the 5th position** and **R in position 2, 3, or 4**.
- Test new high-frequency letters (e.g., T, N, O, L, D) to maximize information.
- Avoid A, I, S entirely.

### Why ""DRONE""?
- **D**: New common consonant (not yet tested).
- **R**: Placed in position 2 to check if it's correct there (if not, it must be in 3 or 4).
- **O**: New common vowel (not yet tested).
- **N**: New common consonant (not yet tested).
- **E**: Confirmed in the 5th position → `✓`.
- It avoids A, I, S and covers 4 new letters (D, R, O, N), which could quickly reveal more about the secret word.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess in Wordle, I want a word that maximizes the information gained by including high-frequency letters: common vowels (A, E, I) and common consonants (R, S). This helps reveal multiple aspects of the secret word through feedback. ""RAISE"" is an excellent choice because:
- It contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), increasing the chance of hitting relevant letters.
- All letters are distinct, covering more possibilities.
- It's a valid English word, so it's acceptable.
- If no letters are correct, I'll quickly eliminate R, A, I, S, E from many positions. If some are present or correct, it gives strong clues for the next guess.

<guess>raise -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
<｜Assistant｜>We are starting a new game. The user has asked for the first guess.
 After the first guess, the system will provide feedback based on the secret word (which is unknown to me).
 For the first guess, I need to choose a word that maximizes information gain. Common starting words include those with many vowels or common consonants.
 ""RAISE"" is a classic opening word because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), and all letters are distinct.

 However, the user provided the guess ""tags"" in the previous context. But note: the user says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" and refers to ""Guess 1: tags"", but then says ""So, in my thought process, I've reasoned it out"" and ""Therefore, my first guess is 'RAISE'"".

 But wait, the user's previous feedback section says: ""Guess 1: tags."" ... and then they say they reasoned it out and their guess is RAISE. However, the user's message is:

 ""Make your first 5-letter word guess.

 Here is some previous feedback: 
 Guess 1: tags.

 So, in my thought process, I've reasoned it out.

 Therefore, my first guess is 'RAISE'""

 This seems contradictory because they mention previous feedback (Guess 1: tags) but then say they are making a first guess as RAISE.

 Clarification: The user might be simulating that they have provided a guess and got feedback? But the instruction says: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" with ""previous feedback"" given as ""Guess 1: tags."" without any feedback symbols.

 Let me re-read: 

 ""Here is some previous feedback: 
 Guess 1: tags.""

 But there is no feedback for the guess ""tags"" provided? It just says ""tags"". 

 Actually, looking at the example in the system prompt: 

 ""Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)""

 So the format is: Guess followed by feedback. Here, the user says ""Guess 1: tags."" with no feedback symbols? 

 The user message is ambiguous. However, note that the user says ""Make your first 5-letter word guess"" and then references that there has been a previous feedback (with Guess 1: tags). This suggests that I am making the second guess? But wait, the user says ""first"" in the current message.

 Let me parse the entire conversation:

 First message by system: Explained the rules and response format.
 First user message: ""Make your first 5-letter word guess."" -> I responded with ""raise"".

 Now second user message: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess. Here is some previous feedback: Guess 1: tags.""

 So after I guessed ""raise"", the user is now saying that the previous feedback was for a guess ""tags""? That doesn't make sense because I didn't suggest ""tags"". 

 Alternative: Perhaps the user is providing an example? Or is ""tags"" a mistake?

 The user says: ""So, in my thought process, I've reasoned it out. Therefore, my first guess is 'RAISE'"".

 And then the response format requires me to make a guess.

 But note: the user says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" and gives previous feedback: ""Guess 1: tags."" ... without feedback symbols. 

 This is confusing. Let me think about the context:

 - In my first response to the user's first message, I guessed ""raise"".
 - Now the user is responding and says: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess."" meaning this is the second guess? And they are providing feedback on the first guess? But the feedback they provided is ""Guess 1: tags."" which doesn't follow the feedback format.

 Possible interpretation: The user meant that for the first guess, they guessed ""tags"" and now they want me to make the second guess? But then the feedback is missing. 

 However, note the system prompt: 
 ""After each guess, you will receive feedback""
 and I have received none? The user only wrote ""Guess 1: tags."" without feedback symbols.

 How can I proceed? 

 Alternatively, perhaps the user is indicating that the first guess was ""tags"" and now I am the one making the second guess? But the user says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" meaning I am making the next guess? And they haven't provided any feedback for ""tags"".

 Since the feedback format requires symbols (✓, -, x) and none are given, I should ask for clarification? But the instruction says to return the guessed word in the format.

 Given the confusion, I think the user might have made a mistake. However, let's stick to the fact that the user says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" and provides ""Guess 1: tags."" as previous feedback. Since there is no feedback symbols, perhaps it means that the guess ""tags"" was made? And now I need to make the second guess without feedback? That doesn't make sense.

 Another idea: Maybe the user is providing the feedback in an unclear way? For instance, ""Guess 1: tags"" might mean that the secret word was ""TAGS""? But that's not feedback on a guess.

 My best interpretation: The user is probably asking for the first guess, and the part about ""previous feedback"" is a mistake? Because they then say ""So, in my thought process, I've reasoned it out. Therefore, my first guess is 'RAISE'"". 

 Since this is ambiguous, I will assume that the user is still asking for the first guess because:

 1. The user says ""Make your first 5-letter word guess"" in the first message, and I responded with ""raise"".
 2. In the second message, the user says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" but then refers to their own first guess as ""tags"" and then concludes with their own guess as ""RAISE"". 

 Wait, the user wrote:

 ""Make a new 5-letter word guess.

 Here is some previous: 
 Guess 1: tags.

 So, in my thought process, I've reasoned it out.

 Therefore, my first guess is 'RAISE'""

 This reads as if the user is providing their own reasoning and guess? Then they expect me to make the next guess? 

 The conversation:

 User Message 1: ""Make your first 5-letter word guess.""
 My Response: <guess>raise</guess>

 User Message 2: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess. Here is some previous feedback: Guess 1: tags. ... Therefore, my first guess is 'RAISE'"".

 Now, the user says they made a first guess as RAISE? But I already suggested ""raise"". 

 How should I interpret the ""Guess 1: tags"" part? It might be a typo? Or an example? 

 Alternatively, perhaps the user is saying that the secret word is ""TAGS""? But that would be the solution, which they wouldn't reveal.

 Given the confusion, I will proceed by ignoring the inconsistency and making the second guess? However, the user hasn't provided feedback for my first guess (raise). They mentioned feedback for a guess ""tags"" which I never made.

 Since I have no feedback for my own first guess (raise), I cannot make an informed second guess.

 Therefore, I will assume that the user intended to provide feedback for my first guess of ""raise"". But they provided ""Guess 1: tags"". 

 Due to the lack of clarity, I must rely on the system's response format. Since the user is asking for a ""new guess"", that implies we are on guess 2. But without feedback from guess 1, I cannot proceed logically.

 How about this: Note that the user says ""Here is some previous feedback: Guess 1: tags"". They might be giving an example? Perhaps in their example game they guessed ""tags""? But then they decided to use ""RAISE"" as their real first guess? Or is it my first guess?

 Since my role is to guess words, I think I have to treat this as we are starting the game and I've been asked for the first guess again? Maybe the user wants me to ignore the first round?

 Alternatively, the user might have intended to say: The first guess made (by either of us) was ""tags"", and now I need to make the second guess? But I never knew what feedback was given for ""tags"". So I cannot use that.

 Conclusion: I'll treat the request as asking for a first guess again because:

 - The user restates: ""Therefore, my first guess is 'RAISE'"", suggesting that RAISE was the first guess.
 - The ""previous feedback"" with ""tags"" might be an error. 

 Therefore, I will provide a new first guess? But the game already started? 

 Given the confusion, I'll restart: My first guess (if this is indeed the first guess) could be ""RAISE"". But I already used it? 

 Since the user says they are making their first guess as RAISE, then I, as the assistant, should make a new guess? 

 Perhaps the user is playing one side and I am playing the other? 

 This is too confusing. I'll default to repeating my first guess: RAISE.

 But note that the system prompt says: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"". So I must return a guess.

 However, without feedback from my previous guess (if any), I cannot advance.

 Alternatively, I'll assume that the user's feedback ""Guess 1: tags"" means that I made a guess of ""TAGS"" and that was not correct? But no feedback symbols? 

 I think the best course of action is to treat this as the first guess again, since the user says ""first guess"" in their reasoning.

 But then why mention ""prior feedback""?

 Due to the confusion, I will make a new first guess, using a different word. Why not? Let's choose ""SLATE"", which is another optimized starting word.

 Why ""SLATE""? It includes common letters S, L, A, T, E. It's also very good.

 Or to avoid duplication, I can use ""CRANE"".

 But since the user said they are using ""RAISE"", I'll use a different one.

 Therefore, for this ""new"" first guess, I pick ""SLATE"".

<guess>slate</guess>

 But note: the user might intended to provide feedback for my first guess, which was ""raise"". So I should wait for that feedback? 

 Since the user's message doesn't contain feedback for ""raise"", I will assume we are resetting. 

 If the user meant for me to make a second guess without feedback, that's impossible. 

 Therefore, I choose to make a fresh start with a new first guess: ""SLATE"".

Guess 2: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)

This means:
- R is present in the word but not in the first position (because the symbol is ""-"" for wrong position).
- A is not in the word (x).
- I is not in the word (x).
- S is not in the word (x).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (fifth, since it's the last letter).

So the secret word has:
- The letter E in the 5th position.
- The letter R is present, but not in the 1st position.
- The letters A, I, S are absent.

Therefore, the secret word must have:
- 5th letter: E
- Contains R (but not at position 1)
- Does not contain A, I, S.

We have 6 tries, and this is the second guess (since the first was ""raise"").

Now, for the second guess, I need to choose a word that:
- Includes the known correct letter E in the 5th position.
- Includes the letter R (but not in the first position) and possibly other common letters that haven't been tested yet.
- Avoids the letters A, I, S (since they are absent).

Common letters not yet tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I should also consider that R must be in the word but not at position 1. So R can be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

I want to test as many new common letters as possible. Common consonants: T, N, L, C, etc. Common vowels: O, U.

A good candidate: ""TROVE""
- T: new common consonant
- R: we know it's present, and we can test it in position 2 (which is not position 1, so allowed)

""TRICE"" — but I is absent, so invalid.

""DRONE"":

But let's think about frequency. T, N, L are more common than P, B.

""TROVE"" and ""DRONE"" are both good. I'll choose ""DRONE"" because it includes N, which is a very common letter.

So my second guess: ""DRONE""

But wait, we must ensure the word is valid. ""DRONE"" is a valid 5-letter word.

Feedback expectations for ""DRONE"":
- D: ? (could be absent, present, or correct)

- E: ✓ (we know it's correct)

But note: the goal is to get information. ""DRONE"" tests four new letters and the position of R.

Alternatively, ""TROVE"" tests T, R, O, V, E.

I think ""DRONE"" is slightly better because N is more common than V.

So I'll go with ""DRONE"".

But note: the user's own first guess was ""RAISE"", and we have feedback for it. Then I am making the second guess.

Therefore, the next guess is ""DRONE"".

But let me double-check: the feedback for ""RAISE"" was R(-), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(✓). So we know:
- E is in position 5.
- R is in the word, but not in position 1.
- A, I, S are absent.

So ""DRONE"" is a valid guess.

I have six tries to guess a secret five-letter English word. For this first guess, I have no prior feedback, so I want to choose a word that maximizes the information I get, especially since the feedback includes whether each letter is correct, present but wrong position, or absent.\n\nA common strategy in Wordle is to start with a word that uses multiple common letters and includes vowels to cover frequent possibilities. That way, the feedback can reveal a lot about the secret word. Letters like A, E, I, O, U are vowels and appear in many words. Consonants like R, S, T, L, N are also very common.\n\nOne popular starting word in Wordle is ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" because they have a good mix of common consonants and vowels. Another one is ""ROATE"", but I think ""CRANE"" might be better since all letters are fairly common.\n\nLet me check a list of common starting words. Common first guesses often include words like:\n\n- CRANE\n\n- SLATE\n\n- SALET (but salet might be less common)\n\n- ADIEU (which has many vowels, but fewer common consonants)\n\n- STERN\n\nI should avoid using very obscure words since I have to guess valid English words. ""CRANE"" is a common and valid word.\n\nMy goal is to cover as many possibilities as possible. Having a balanced distribution is good.\n\nAnother word often recommended is ""SOARE"", but that might be too obscure.\n\nI recall that ""RAISE"" is a popular starting word because it has three vowels and common consonants.\n\n- R, A, I, S, E: A and I are vowels, E is a vowel, and R and S are high-frequency consonants.\n\nSimilarly, ""AROSE"" has A, O, E vowels and R, S consonants.\n\nBut let\'s quantify it. According to letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, etc.\n\nFor Wordle specifically, since it\'s five-letter words, the frequency might differ slightly.\n\nI should think about including letters that appear in many positions.\n\nBut for the first guess, simplicity is key.\n\nI\'ll go with ""RAISE"". Why?\n\n- It contains A and I, two common vowels.\n\n- E, which is another vowel, very common.\n\n- R and S, both top consonants.\n\n- It has no repeated letters.\n\nYes, ""RAISE"" seems solid: R, A, I, S, E.\n\nAfter guessing ""RAISE"", the feedback will tell me:\n\n- For R: if it\'s in the word and correct position (position 1), or present but wrong position, or absent.\n\n- Similarly for A, I, S, E in positions 2,3,4,5.\n\nThis should give me a good foundation for narrowing down the possibilities.\n\nIf I get lucky and some letters are correct, great; if not, I\'ll know which letters are present so I can use them in the next guess.\n\nFor example, if E is in the word but not at the end, I might try it elsewhere.\n\nSimilarly for other letters.\n\nSo, I\'ll use ""RAISE"" as my first guess.\n\nThe response needs to be in a specific format: I need to think step by step, then provide the guess in <guess> tags.\n\nSo, in my thought process, I\'ve reasoned it out.\n\nTherefore, my first guess is ""RAISE"".For the first guess in Wordle, I want a word that maximizes the information gained by including high-frequency letters: common vowels (A, E, I) and common consonants (R, S). This helps reveal multiple aspects of the secret word through feedback. ""RAISE"" is an excellent choice because:\n- It contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), increasing the chance of hitting relevant letters.\n- All letters are distinct, covering more possibilities.\n- It\'s a valid English word, so it\'s acceptable.\n- If no letters are correct, I\'ll quickly eliminate R, A, I, S, E from many positions. If some are present or correct, it gives strong clues for the next guess.\n\n<guess>tags.\n\nSo, in my thought process, I\'ve reasoned it out.\n\nTherefore, my first guess is ""RAISE"".\n</think>\nFor the first guess in Wordle, I want a word that maximizes the information gained by including high-frequency letters: common vowels (A, E, I) and common consonants (R, S).

The user has asked for the first guess.\n After the first guess, the system will provide feedback based on the secret word (which is unknown to me).\n For the first guess, I need to choose a word that maximizes information gain. Common starting words include those with many vowels or common consonants.\n ""RAISE"" is a classic opening word because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), and all letters are distinct.\n\n However, the user provided the guess ""tags"" in the previous context. But note: the user says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" and refers to ""Guess 1: tags"", but then says ""So, in my thought process, I\'ve reasoned it out"" and ""Therefore, my first guess is \'RAISE\'"".\n\n But wait, the user\'s previous feedback section says: ""Guess 1: tags."" ... and then they say they reasoned it out and their guess is RAISE. However, the user\'s message is:\n\n ""Make your first 5-letter word guess.\n\n Here is some previous feedback: \n Guess 1: tags.\n\n So, in my thought process, I\'ve reasoned it out.\n\n Therefore, my first guess is \'RAISE\'""\n\n This seems contradictory because they mention previous feedback (Guess 1: tags) but then say they are making a first guess as RAISE.\n\n Clarification: The user might be simulating that they have provided a guess and got feedback? But the instruction says: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" with ""previous feedback"" given as ""Guess 1: tags."" without any feedback symbols.\n\n Let me re-read: \n\n ""Here is some previous feedback: \n Guess 1: tags.""\n\n But there is no feedback for the guess ""tags"" provided? It just says ""tags"". \n\n Actually, looking at the example in the system prompt: \n\n ""Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)""\n\n So the format is: Guess followed by feedback. Here, the user says ""Guess 1: tags."" with no feedback symbols? \n\n The user message is ambiguous. However, note that the user says ""Make your first 5-letter word guess"" and then references that there has been a previous feedback (with Guess 1: tags). This suggests that I am making the second guess? But wait, the user says ""first"" in the current message.\n\n Let me parse the entire conversation:\n\n First message by system: Explained the rules and response format.\n First user message: ""Make your first 5-letter word guess."" -> I responded with ""raise"".\n\n Now second user message: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess. Here is some previous feedback: Guess 1: tags.""\n\n So after I guessed ""raise"", the user is now saying that the previous feedback was for a guess ""tags""? That doesn\'t make sense because I didn\'t suggest ""tags"". \n\n Alternative: Perhaps the user is providing an example? Or is ""tags"" a mistake?\n\n The user says: ""So, in my thought process, I\'ve reasoned it out. Therefore, my first guess is \'RAISE\'"".\n\n And then the response format requires me to make a guess.\n\n But note: the user says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" and gives previous feedback: ""Guess 1: tags."" ... without feedback symbols. \n\n This is confusing. Let me think about the context:\n\n - In my first response to the user\'s first message, I guessed ""raise"".\n - Now the user is responding and says: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess."" meaning this is the second guess? And they are providing feedback on the first guess? But the feedback they provided is ""Guess 1: tags."" which doesn\'t follow the feedback format.\n\n Possible interpretation: The user meant that for the first guess, they guessed ""tags"" and now they want me to make the second guess? But then the feedback is missing. \n\n However, note the system prompt: \n ""After each guess, you will receive feedback""\n and I have received none? The user only wrote ""Guess 1: tags."" without feedback symbols.\n\n How can I proceed? \n\n Alternatively, perhaps the user is indicating that the first guess was ""tags"" and now I am the one making the second guess? But the user says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" meaning I am making the next guess? And they haven\'t provided any feedback for ""tags"".\n\n Since the feedback format requires symbols (✓, -, x) and none are given, I should ask for clarification? But the instruction says to return the guessed word in the format.\n\n Given the confusion, I think the user might have made a mistake. However, let\'s stick to the fact that the user says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" and provides ""Guess 1: tags."" as previous feedback. Since there is no feedback symbols, perhaps it means that the guess ""tags"" was made? And now I need to make the second guess without feedback? That doesn\'t make sense.\n\n Another idea: Maybe the user is providing the feedback in an unclear way? For instance, ""Guess 1: tags"" might mean that the secret word was ""TAGS""? But that\'s not feedback on a guess.\n\n My best interpretation: The user is probably asking for the first guess, and the part about ""previous feedback"" is a mistake? Because they then say ""So, in my thought process, I\'ve reasoned it out. Therefore, my first guess is \'RAISE\'"". \n\n Since this is ambiguous, I will assume that the user is still asking for the first guess because:\n\n 1. The user says ""Make your first 5-letter word guess"" in the first message, and I responded with ""raise"".\n 2. In the second message, the user says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" but then refers to their own first guess as ""tags"" and then concludes with their own guess as ""RAISE"". \n\n Wait, the user wrote:\n\n ""Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\n Here is some previous: \n Guess 1: tags.\n\n So, in my thought process, I\'ve reasoned it out.\n\n Therefore, my first guess is \'RAISE\'""\n\n This reads as if the user is providing their own reasoning and guess? Then they expect me to make the next guess? \n\n The conversation:\n\n User Message 1: ""Make your first 5-letter word guess.""\n My Response: <guess>raise</guess>\n\n User Message 2: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess. Here is some previous feedback: Guess 1: tags. ... Therefore, my first guess is \'RAISE\'"".\n\n Now, the user says they made a first guess as RAISE? But I already suggested ""raise"". \n\n How should I interpret the ""Guess 1: tags"" part? It might be a typo? Or an example? \n\n Alternatively, perhaps the user is saying that the secret word is ""TAGS""? But that would be the solution, which they wouldn\'t reveal.\n\n Given the confusion, I will proceed by ignoring the inconsistency and making the second guess? However, the user hasn\'t provided feedback for my first guess (raise). They mentioned feedback for a guess ""tags"" which I never made.\n\n Since I have no feedback for my own first guess (raise), I cannot make an informed second guess.\n\n Therefore, I will assume that the user intended to provide feedback for my first guess of ""raise"". But they provided ""Guess 1: tags"". \n\n Due to the lack of clarity, I must rely on the system\'s response format. Since the user is asking for a ""new guess"", that implies we are on guess 2. But without feedback from guess 1, I cannot proceed logically.\n\n How about this: Note that the user says ""Here is some previous feedback: Guess 1: tags"". They might be giving an example? Perhaps in their example game they guessed ""tags""? But then they decided to use ""RAISE"" as their real first guess? Or is it my first guess?\n\n Since my role is to guess words, I think I have to treat this as we are starting the game and I\'ve been asked for the first guess again? Maybe the user wants me to ignore the first round?\n\n Alternatively, the user might have intended to say: The first guess made (by either of us) was ""tags"", and now I need to make the second guess? But I never knew what feedback was given for ""tags"". So I cannot use that.\n\n Conclusion: I\'ll treat the request as asking for a first guess again because:\n\n - The user restates: ""Therefore, my first guess is \'RAISE\'"", suggesting that RAISE was the first guess.\n - The ""previous feedback"" with ""tags"" might be an error. \n\n Therefore, I will provide a new first guess? But the game already started? \n\n Given the confusion, I\'ll restart: My first guess (if this is indeed the first guess) could be ""RAISE"". But I already used it? \n\n Since the user says they are making their first guess as RAISE, then I, as the assistant, should make a new guess? \n\n Perhaps the user is playing one side and I am playing the other? \n\n This is too confusing. I\'ll default to repeating my first guess: RAISE.\n\n But note that the system prompt says: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"". So I must return a guess.\n\n However, without feedback from my previous guess (if any), I cannot advance.\n\n Alternatively, I\'ll assume that the user\'s feedback ""Guess 1: tags"" means that I made a guess of ""TAGS"" and that was not correct? But no feedback symbols? \n\n I think the best course of action is to treat this as the first guess again, since the user says ""first guess"" in their reasoning.\n\n But then why mention ""prior feedback""?\n\n Due to the confusion, I will make a new first guess, using a different word. Why not? Let\'s choose ""SLATE"", which is another optimized starting word.\n\n Why ""SLATE""? It includes common letters S, L, A, T, E. It\'s also very good.\n\n Or to avoid duplication, I can use ""CRANE"".\n\n But since the user said they are using ""RAISE"", I\'ll use a different one.\n\n Therefore, for this ""new"" first guess, I pick ""SLATE"".\n\n<guess>slate</guess>\n\n But note: the user might intended to provide feedback for my first guess, which was ""raise"". So I should wait for that feedback? \n\n Since the user\'s message doesn\'t contain feedback for ""raise"", I will assume we are resetting. \n\n If the user meant for me to make a second guess without feedback, that\'s impossible. \n\n Therefore, I choose to make a fresh start with a new first guess: ""SLATE"".\n\n<guess>raise</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: tags.\n\nSo, in my thought process, I\'ve reasoned it out.\n\nTherefore, my first guess is ""RAISE"".\n</think>\nFor the first guess in Wordle, I want a word that maximizes the information gained by including high-frequency letters: common vowels (A, E, I) and common consonants (R, S).

Common consonants: T, N, L, C, etc. Common vowels: O, U.\n\nA good candidate: ""TROVE""\n- T: new common consonant\n- R: we know it\'s present, and we can test it in position 2 (which is not position 1, so allowed)\n- O: new vowel\n- V: less common, but we need to test\n- E: in the correct 5th position.\n\nBut let me check if there are better options.\n\nAnother option: ""CRANE"" — but we know A is absent, so we cannot use A.

That\'s four new letters (D, O, N, and R in a new position) and confirms E.\n\nBut note: we know R is present, so putting it in position 2 is good. Also, we avoid A, I, S.\n\nAnother candidate: ""PROBE"" — but we don\'t know about P, B, and O. However, it has E at the end. But we are avoiding A, I, S. Also, R is in position 2.\n\nBut ""PROBE"" uses P, R, O, B, E. That\'s good.\n\nBut let\'s think about frequency. T, N, L are more common than P, B.\n\n""TROVE"" and ""DRONE"" are both good. I\'ll choose ""DRONE"" because it includes N, which is a very common letter.\n\nSo my second guess: ""DRONE""\n\nBut wait, we must ensure the word is valid. ""DRONE"" is a valid 5-letter word.\n\nFeedback expectations for ""DRONE"":\n- D: ? (could be absent, present, or correct)\n- R: if the secret word has R in position 2, then ✓; otherwise, if R is in 3 or 4, then - (because we know R is present but not in 1, so if not in 2, then it must be in 3 or 4, so we get a - for R in this guess if it\'s not in 2).\n- O: ?\n- N: ?\n- E: ✓ (we know it\'s correct)\n\nBut note: the goal is to get information. ""DRONE"" tests four new letters and the position of R.\n\nAlternatively, ""TROVE"" tests T, R, O, V, E.\n\nI think ""DRONE"" is slightly better because N is more common than V.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""DRONE"".\n\nBut note: the user\'s own first guess was ""RAISE"", and we have feedback for it.

So we know:\n- E is in position 5.\n- R is in the word, but not in position 1.\n- A, I, S are absent.\n\nSo ""DRONE"" is a valid guess.\n\nFinal decision: ""DRONE""Based on the feedback from your first guess ""RAISE"":\n- **R**: Present but wrong position (not 1st) → `-`\n- **A**: Absent → `x`\n- **I**: Absent → `x`\n- **S**: Absent → `x`\n- **E**: Correct position (5th) → `✓`\n\n### Key Insights:\n- The secret word has **E in the 5th position**.\n- **R is in the word**, but not in the 1st position (so it must be in position 2, 3, or 4).\n- **A, I, and S are absent** and can be excluded from future guesses.\n\n### Strategy for the Next Guess:\n- Prioritize words with **E in the 5th position** and **R in position 2, 3, or 4**.\n- Test new high-frequency letters (e.g., T, N, O, L, D) to maximize information.\n- Avoid A, I, S entirely.\n\n### Why ""DRONE""?\n- **D**: New common consonant (not yet tested).\n- **R**: Placed in position 2 to check if it\'s correct there (if not, it must be in 3 or 4).\n- **O**: New common vowel (not yet tested).\n- **N**: New common consonant (not yet tested).\n- **E**: Confirmed in the 5th position → `✓`.\n- It avoids A, I, S and covers 4 new letters (D, R, O, N), which could quickly reveal more about the secret word.\n\n<guess>raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)\n\nThis means:\n- R is present in the word but not in the first position (because the symbol is ""-"" for wrong position).\n- A is not in the word (x).\n- I is not in the word (x).\n- S is not in the word (x).\n- E is in the word and in the correct position (fifth, since it\'s the last letter).\n\nSo the secret word has:\n- The letter E in the 5th position.\n- The letter R is present, but not in the 1st position.\n- The letters A, I, S are absent.\n\nTherefore, the secret word must have:\n- 5th letter: E\n- Contains R (but not at position 1)\n- Does not contain A, I, S.\n\nWe have 6 tries, and this is the second guess (since the first was ""raise"").\n\nNow, for the second guess, I need to choose a word that:\n- Includes the known correct letter E in the 5th position.\n- Includes the letter R (but not in the first position) and possibly other common letters that haven\'t been tested yet.\n- Avoids the letters A, I, S (since they are absent).\n\nCommon letters not yet tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nI should also consider that R must be in the word but not at position 1.

Based on the feedback history:
- Guess 1: ""RAISE"" → Feedback: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
- This means:
  - E is in the word and correctly placed at position 5.
  - R is in the word but not at position 1.
  - A, I, S are not in the word.
- The secret word has E as the last letter, contains R (positions 2,3, or 4), and excludes A, I, S.

For the second guess:
- Must place E at position 5 and include R (avoiding position 1).
- Used ""DRONE"" in a previous attempt, but now given new guess request.
- Alternate word chosen: ""TROVE"" to test different letters:
  - T: High-frequency consonant not tested.
  - R: Position 2 (testing if correct spot).
  - O: Untested vowel.
  - V: Less common, but expands coverage.

<guess>raise -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
<｜Assistant｜>We are starting a new game. The user has asked for the first guess.
 After the first guess, the system will provide feedback based on the secret word (which is unknown to me).
 For the first guess, I need to choose a word that maximizes information gain. Common starting words include those with many vowels or common consonants.
 ""RAISE"" is a classic opening word because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), and all letters are distinct.

 However, the user provided the guess ""tags"" in the previous context. But note: the user says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" and refers to ""Guess 1: tags"", but then says ""So, in my thought process, I've reasoned it out"" and ""Therefore, my first guess is 'RAISE'"".

 But wait, the user's previous feedback section says: ""Guess 1: tags."" ... and then they say they reasoned it out and their guess is RAISE. However, the user's message is:

 ""Make your first 5-letter word guess.

 Here is some previous feedback: 
 Guess 1: tags.

 So, in my thought process, I've reasoned it out.

 Therefore, my first guess is 'RAISE'""

 This seems contradictory because they mention previous feedback (Guess 1: tags) but then say they are making a first guess as RAISE.

 Clarification: The user might be simulating that they have provided a guess and got feedback? But the instruction says: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" with ""previous feedback"" given as ""Guess 1: tags."" without any feedback symbols.

 Let me re-read: 

 ""Here is some previous feedback: 
 Guess 1: tags.""

 But there is no feedback for the guess ""tags"" provided? It just says ""tags"". 

 Actually, looking at the example in the system prompt: 

 ""Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)""

 So the format is: Guess followed by feedback. Here, the user says ""Guess 1: tags."" with no feedback symbols? 

 The user message is ambiguous. However, note that the user says ""Make your first 5-letter word guess"" and then references that there has been a previous feedback (with Guess 1: tags). This suggests that I am making the second guess? But wait, the user says ""first"" in the current message.

 Let me parse the entire conversation:

 First message by system: Explained the rules and response format.
 First user message: ""Make your first 5-letter word guess."" -> I responded with ""raise"".

 Now second user message: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess. Here is some previous feedback: Guess 1: tags.""

 So after I guessed ""raise"", the user is now saying that the previous feedback was for a guess ""tags""? That doesn't make sense because I didn't suggest ""tags"". 

 Alternative: Perhaps the user is providing an example? Or is ""tags"" a mistake?

 The user says: ""So, in my thought process, I've reasoned it out. Therefore, my first guess is 'RAISE'"".

 And then the response format requires me to make a guess.

 But note: the user says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" and gives previous feedback: ""Guess 1: tags."" ... without feedback symbols. 

 This is confusing. Let me think about the context:

 - In my first response to the user's first message, I guessed ""raise"".
 - Now the user is responding and says: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess."" meaning this is the second guess? And they are providing feedback on the first guess? But the feedback they provided is ""Guess 1: tags."" which doesn't follow the feedback format.

 Possible interpretation: The user meant that for the first guess, they guessed ""tags"" and now they want me to make the second guess? But then the feedback is missing. 

 However, note the system prompt: 
 ""After each guess, you will receive feedback""
 and I have received none? The user only wrote ""Guess 1: tags."" without feedback symbols.

 How can I proceed? 

 Alternatively, perhaps the user is indicating that the first guess was ""tags"" and now I am the one making the second guess? But the user says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" meaning I am making the next guess? And they haven't provided any feedback for ""tags"".

 Since the feedback format requires symbols (✓, -, x) and none are given, I should ask for clarification? But the instruction says to return the guessed word in the format.

 Given the confusion, I think the user might have made a mistake. However, let's stick to the fact that the user says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" and provides ""Guess 1: tags."" as previous feedback. Since there is no feedback symbols, perhaps it means that the guess ""tags"" was made? And now I need to make the second guess without feedback? That doesn't make sense.

 Another idea: Maybe the user is providing the feedback in an unclear way? For instance, ""Guess 1: tags"" might mean that the secret word was ""TAGS""? But that's not feedback on a guess.

 My best interpretation: The user is probably asking for the first guess, and the part about ""previous feedback"" is a mistake? Because they then say ""So, in my thought process, I've reasoned it out. Therefore, my first guess is 'RAISE'"". 

 Since this is ambiguous, I will assume that the user is still asking for the first guess because:

 1. The user says ""Make your first 5-letter word guess"" in the first message, and I responded with ""raise"".
 2. In the second message, the user says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" but then refers to their own first guess as ""tags"" and then concludes with their own guess as ""RAISE"". 

 Wait, the user wrote:

 ""Make a new 5-letter word guess.

 Here is some previous: 
 Guess 1: tags.

 So, in my thought process, I've reasoned it out.

 Therefore, my first guess is 'RAISE'""

 This reads as if the user is providing their own reasoning and guess? Then they expect me to make the next guess? 

 The conversation:

 User Message 1: ""Make your first 5-letter word guess.""
 My Response: <guess>raise</guess>

 User Message 2: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess. Here is some previous feedback: Guess 1: tags. ... Therefore, my first guess is 'RAISE'"".

 Now, the user says they made a first guess as RAISE? But I already suggested ""raise"". 

 How should I interpret the ""Guess 1: tags"" part? It might be a typo? Or an example? 

 Alternatively, perhaps the user is saying that the secret word is ""TAGS""? But that would be the solution, which they wouldn't reveal.

 Given the confusion, I will proceed by ignoring the inconsistency and making the second guess? However, the user hasn't provided feedback for my first guess (raise). They mentioned feedback for a guess ""tags"" which I never made.

 Since I have no feedback for my own first guess (raise), I cannot make an informed second guess.

 Therefore, I will assume that the user intended to provide feedback for my first guess of ""raise"". But they provided ""Guess 1: tags"". 

 Due to the lack of clarity, I must rely on the system's response format. Since the user is asking for a ""new guess"", that implies we are on guess 2. But without feedback from guess 1, I cannot proceed logically.

 How about this: Note that the user says ""Here is some previous feedback: Guess 1: tags"". They might be giving an example? Perhaps in their example game they guessed ""tags""? But then they decided to use ""RAISE"" as their real first guess? Or is it my first guess?

 Since my role is to guess words, I think I have to treat this as we are starting the game and I've been asked for the first guess again? Maybe the user wants me to ignore the first round?

 Alternatively, the user might have intended to say: The first guess made (by either of us) was ""tags"", and now I need to make the second guess? But I never knew what feedback was given for ""tags"". So I cannot use that.

 Conclusion: I'll treat the request as asking for a first guess again because:

 - The user restates: ""Therefore, my first guess is 'RAISE'"", suggesting that RAISE was the first guess.
 - The ""previous feedback"" with ""tags"" might be an error. 

 Therefore, I will provide a new first guess? But the game already started? 

 Given the confusion, I'll restart: My first guess (if this is indeed the first guess) could be ""RAISE"". But I already used it? 

 Since the user says they are making their first guess as RAISE, then I, as the assistant, should make a new guess? 

 Perhaps the user is playing one side and I am playing the other? 

 This is too confusing. I'll default to repeating my first guess: RAISE.

 But note that the system prompt says: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"". So I must return a guess.

 However, without feedback from my previous guess (if any), I cannot advance.

 Alternatively, I'll assume that the user's feedback ""Guess 1: tags"" means that I made a guess of ""TAGS"" and that was not correct? But no feedback symbols? 

 I think the best course of action is to treat this as the first guess again, since the user says ""first guess"" in their reasoning.

 But then why mention ""prior feedback""?

 Due to the confusion, I will make a new first guess, using a different word. Why not? Let's choose ""SLATE"", which is another optimized starting word.

 Why ""SLATE""? It includes common letters S, L, A, T, E. It's also very good.

 Or to avoid duplication, I can use ""CRANE"".

 But since the user said they are using ""RAISE"", I'll use a different one.

 Therefore, for this ""new"" first guess, I pick ""SLATE"".

<guess>slate</guess>

 But note: the user might intended to provide feedback for my first guess, which was ""raise"". So I should wait for that feedback? 

 Since the user's message doesn't contain feedback for ""raise"", I will assume we are resetting. 

 If the user meant for me to make a second guess without feedback, that's impossible. 

 Therefore, I choose to make a fresh start with a new first guess: ""SLATE"".

- **A**: Absent → `x`
- **I**: Absent → `x`

- **R is in the word**, but not in the 1st position (so it must be in position 2, 3, or 4).
- **A, I, and S are absent** and can be excluded from future guesses.

### Strategy for the Next Guess:

- **R**: Placed in position 2 to check if it's correct there (if not, it must be in 3 or 4).
- **O**: New common vowel (not yet tested).
- **N**: New common consonant (not yet tested).
- **E**: Confirmed in the 5th position → `✓`.
- It avoids A, I, S and covers 4 new letters (D, R, O, N), which could quickly reveal more about the secret word.

- I is not in the word (x).
- S is not in the word (x).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (fifth, since it's the last letter).

So the secret word has:
- The letter E in the 5th position.
- The letter R is present, but not in the 1st position.
- The letters A, I, S are absent.

Therefore, the secret word must have:
- 5th letter: E
- Contains R (but not at position 1)
- Does not contain A, I, S.

We have 6 tries, and this is the second guess (since the first was ""raise"").

Now, for the second guess, I need to choose a word that:
- Includes the known correct letter E in the 5th position.
- Includes the letter R (but not in the first position) and possibly other common letters that haven't been tested yet.
- Avoids the letters A, I, S (since they are absent).

Common letters not yet tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I should also consider that R must be in the word but not at position 1. So R can be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

I want to test as many new common letters as possible. Common consonants: T, N, L, C, etc. Common vowels: O, U.

A good candidate: ""TROVE""
- T: new common consonant
- R: we know it's present, and we can test it in position 2 (which is not position 1, so allowed)
- O: new vowel
- V: less common, but we need to test
- E: in the correct 5th position.

But let me check if there are better options.

Another option: ""CRANE"" — but we know A is absent, so we cannot use A. So invalid.

""TRICE"" — but I is absent, so invalid.

""DRONE"":
- D: new
- R: in position 2
- O: new
- N: new
- E: correct at end.

""DRONE"" tests D, R, O, N, and E. That's four new letters (D, O, N, and R in a new position) and confirms E.

But note: we know R is present, so putting it in position 2 is good. Also, we avoid A, I, S.

Another candidate: ""PROBE"" — but we don't know about P, B, and O. However, it has E at the end. But we are avoiding A, I, S. Also, R is in position 2.

But ""PROBE"" uses P, R, O, B, E. That's good.

But let's think about frequency. T, N, L are more common than P, B.

""TROVE"" and ""DRONE"" are both good. I'll choose ""DRONE"" because it includes N, which is a very common letter.

So my second guess: ""DRONE""

But wait, we must ensure the word is valid. ""DRONE"" is a valid 5-letter word.

Feedback expectations for ""DRONE"":
- D: ? (could be absent, present, or correct)
- R: if the secret word has R in position 2, then ✓; otherwise, if R is in 3 or 4, then - (because we know R is present but not in 1, so if not in 2, then it must be in 3 or 4, so we get a - for R in this guess if it's not in 2).
- O: ?
- N: ?
- E: ✓ (we know it's correct)

But note: the goal is to get information. ""DRONE"" tests four new letters and the position of R.

Alternatively, ""TROVE"" tests T, R, O, V, E.

I think ""DRONE"" is slightly better because N is more common than V.

So I'll go with ""DRONE"".

But note: the user's own first guess was ""RAISE"", and we have feedback for it. Then I am making the second guess.

Therefore, the next guess is ""DRONE"".

But let me double-check: the feedback for ""RAISE"" was R(-), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(✓). So we know:
- E is in position 5.
- R is in the word, but not in position 1.
- A, I, S are absent.

So ""DRONE"" is a valid guess.

Final decision: ""DRONE""
</think>
Based on the feedback from your first guess ""RAISE"":
- **R**: Present but wrong position (not 1st) → `-`
- **A**: Absent → `x`
- **I**: Absent → `x`
- **S**: Absent → `x`
- **E**: Correct position (5th) → `✓`

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has **E in the 5th position**.
- **R is in the word**, but not in the 1st position (so it must be in position 2, 3, or 4).
- **A, I, and S are absent** and can be excluded from future guesses.

### Strategy for the Next Guess:
- Prioritize words with **E in the 5th position** and **R in position 2, 3, or 4**.
- Test new high-frequency letters (e.g., T, N, O, L, D) to maximize information.
- Avoid A, I, S entirely.

### Why ""DRONE""?
- **D**: New common consonant (not yet tested).
- **R**: Placed in position 2 to check if it's correct there (if not, it must be in 3 or 4).
- **O**: New common vowel (not yet tested).
- **N**: New common consonant (not yet tested).
- **E**: Confirmed in the 5th position → `✓`.
- It avoids A, I, S and covers 4 new letters (D, R, O, N), which could quickly reveal more about the secret word.

<guess>drone -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
<｜Assistant｜>Based on the feedback history:
- Guess 1: ""RAISE"" → Feedback: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
- This means:
  - E is in the word and correctly placed at position 5.
  - R is in the word but not at position 1.
  - A, I, S are not in the word.
- The secret word has E as the last letter, contains R (positions 2,3, or 4), and excludes A, I, S.

For the second guess:
- Must place E at position 5 and include R (avoiding position 1).
- Used ""DRONE"" in a previous attempt, but now given new guess request.
- Alternate word chosen: ""TROVE"" to test different letters:
  - T: High-frequency consonant not tested.
  - R: Position 2 (testing if correct spot).
  - O: Untested vowel.
  - V: Less common, but expands coverage.
  - E: Position 5 (confirmed).

""TROVE"" is valid and probes R’s position while testing T, O, V.

- **E**: Correct position (5th) → `✓`

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has **E in the 5th position**.
- **R is in the word**, but not in the 1st position (so it must be in position 2, 3, or 4).
- **A, I, and S are absent** and should be excluded.

### Strategy for the Next Guess:
- Prioritize words with **E in the 5th position** and **R tested in position 2** (to verify if it's correct there).
- Introduce new high-frequency letters (e.g., T, O, V) to gather more information.
- Avoid A, I, S entirely.

### Why ""TROVE""?
- **T**: Common consonant not yet tested.
- **R**: Placed in position 2 to check if it's correct there (if not, it must be in 3 or 4).
- **O**: Common vowel not yet tested.
- **V**: Less common letter; testing it efficiently covers more ground.
- **E**: Confirmed in the 5th position → `✓`.
- This guess tests three new letters (T, O, V) and probes R's position, while adhering to constraints.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: tags.

So, in my thought process, I've reasoned it out.

Therefore, my first guess is ""RAISE"".
</think>
For the first guess in Wordle, I want a word that maximizes the information gained by including high-frequency letters: common vowels (A, E, I) and common consonants (R, S). This helps reveal multiple aspects of the secret word through feedback. ""RAISE"" is an excellent choice because:
- It contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), increasing the chance of hitting relevant letters.
- All letters are distinct, covering more possibilities.
- It's a valid English word, so it's acceptable.
- If no letters are correct, I'll quickly eliminate R, A, I, S, E from many positions. If some are present or correct, it gives strong clues for the next guess.

<guess>raise -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
Guess 2: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)

This means:
- R is present in the word but not in the first position (because the symbol is ""-"" for wrong position).
- A is not in the word (x).
- I is not in the word (x).
- S is not in the word (x).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (fifth, since it's the last letter).

So the secret word has:
- The letter E in the 5th position.
- The letter R is present, but not in the 1st position.
- The letters A, I, S are absent.

Therefore, the secret word must have:
- 5th letter: E
- Contains R (but not at position 1)
- Does not contain A, I, S.

We have 6 tries, and this is the second guess (since the first was ""raise"").

Common letters not yet tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I want to test as many new common letters as possible. Common consonants: T, N, L, C, etc. Common vowels: O, U.

But let's think about frequency. T, N, L are more common than P, B.

I have six tries to guess a secret five-letter English word. For this first guess, I have no prior feedback, so I want to choose a word that maximizes the information I get, especially since the feedback includes whether each letter is correct, present but wrong position, or absent.\n\nA common strategy in Wordle is to start with a word that uses multiple common letters and includes vowels to cover frequent possibilities. That way, the feedback can reveal a lot about the secret word. Letters like A, E, I, O, U are vowels and appear in many words. Consonants like R, S, T, L, N are also very common.\n\nOne popular starting word in Wordle is ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" because they have a good mix of common consonants and vowels. Another one is ""ROATE"", but I think ""CRANE"" might be better since all letters are fairly common.\n\nLet me check a list of common starting words. Common first guesses often include words like:\n\n- CRANE\n\n- SLATE\n\n- SALET (but salet might be less common)\n\n- ADIEU (which has many vowels, but fewer common consonants)\n\n- STERN\n\nI should avoid using very obscure words since I have to guess valid English words. ""CRANE"" is a common and valid word.\n\nMy goal is to cover as many possibilities as possible. Having a balanced distribution is good.\n\nAnother word often recommended is ""SOARE"", but that might be too obscure.\n\nI recall that ""RAISE"" is a popular starting word because it has three vowels and common consonants.\n\n- R, A, I, S, E: A and I are vowels, E is a vowel, and R and S are high-frequency consonants.\n\nSimilarly, ""AROSE"" has A, O, E vowels and R, S consonants.\n\nBut let\'s quantify it. According to letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, etc.\n\nFor Wordle specifically, since it\'s five-letter words, the frequency might differ slightly.\n\nI should think about including letters that appear in many positions.\n\nBut for the first guess, simplicity is key.\n\nI\'ll go with ""RAISE"". Why?\n\n- It contains A and I, two common vowels.\n\n- E, which is another vowel, very common.\n\n- R and S, both top consonants.\n\n- It has no repeated letters.\n\nYes, ""RAISE"" seems solid: R, A, I, S, E.\n\nAfter guessing ""RAISE"", the feedback will tell me:\n\n- For R: if it\'s in the word and correct position (position 1), or present but wrong position, or absent.\n\n- Similarly for A, I, S, E in positions 2,3,4,5.\n\nThis should give me a good foundation for narrowing down the possibilities.\n\nIf I get lucky and some letters are correct, great; if not, I\'ll know which letters are present so I can use them in the next guess.\n\nFor example, if E is in the word but not at the end, I might try it elsewhere.\n\nSimilarly for other letters.\n\nSo, I\'ll use ""RAISE"" as my first guess.\n\nThe response needs to be in a specific format: I need to think step by step, then provide the guess in <guess> tags.\n\nSo, in my thought process, I\'ve reasoned it out.\n\nTherefore, my first guess is ""RAISE"".For the first guess in Wordle, I want a word that maximizes the information gained by including high-frequency letters: common vowels (A, E, I) and common consonants (R, S).

It just says ""tags"". \n\n Actually, looking at the example in the system prompt: \n\n ""Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)""\n\n So the format is: Guess followed by feedback. Here, the user says ""Guess 1: tags."" with no feedback symbols? \n\n The user message is ambiguous. However, note that the user says ""Make your first 5-letter word guess"" and then references that there has been a previous feedback (with Guess 1: tags). This suggests that I am making the second guess? But wait, the user says ""first"" in the current message.\n\n Let me parse the entire conversation:\n\n First message by system: Explained the rules and response format.\n First user message: ""Make your first 5-letter word guess."" -> I responded with ""raise"".\n\n Now second user message: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess. Here is some previous feedback: Guess 1: tags.""\n\n So after I guessed ""raise"", the user is now saying that the previous feedback was for a guess ""tags""? That doesn\'t make sense because I didn\'t suggest ""tags"". \n\n Alternative: Perhaps the user is providing an example? Or is ""tags"" a mistake?\n\n The user says: ""So, in my thought process, I\'ve reasoned it out. Therefore, my first guess is \'RAISE\'"".\n\n And then the response format requires me to make a guess.\n\n But note: the user says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" and gives previous feedback: ""Guess 1: tags."" ... without feedback symbols. \n\n This is confusing. Let me think about the context:\n\n - In my first response to the user\'s first message, I guessed ""raise"".\n - Now the user is responding and says: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess."" meaning this is the second guess? And they are providing feedback on the first guess? But the feedback they provided is ""Guess 1: tags."" which doesn\'t follow the feedback format.\n\n Possible interpretation: The user meant that for the first guess, they guessed ""tags"" and now they want me to make the second guess? But then the feedback is missing. \n\n However, note the system prompt: \n ""After each guess, you will receive feedback""\n and I have received none? The user only wrote ""Guess 1: tags."" without feedback symbols.\n\n How can I proceed? \n\n Alternatively, perhaps the user is indicating that the first guess was ""tags"" and now I am the one making the second guess? But the user says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" meaning I am making the next guess? And they haven\'t provided any feedback for ""tags"".\n\n Since the feedback format requires symbols (✓, -, x) and none are given, I should ask for clarification? But the instruction says to return the guessed word in the format.\n\n Given the confusion, I think the user might have made a mistake. However, let\'s stick to the fact that the user says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" and provides ""Guess 1: tags."" as previous feedback. Since there is no feedback symbols, perhaps it means that the guess ""tags"" was made? And now I need to make the second guess without feedback? That doesn\'t make sense.\n\n Another idea: Maybe the user is providing the feedback in an unclear way? For instance, ""Guess 1: tags"" might mean that the secret word was ""TAGS""? But that\'s not feedback on a guess.\n\n My best interpretation: The user is probably asking for the first guess, and the part about ""previous feedback"" is a mistake? Because they then say ""So, in my thought process, I\'ve reasoned it out. Therefore, my first guess is \'RAISE\'"". \n\n Since this is ambiguous, I will assume that the user is still asking for the first guess because:\n\n 1. The user says ""Make your first 5-letter word guess"" in the first message, and I responded with ""raise"".\n 2. In the second message, the user says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" but then refers to their own first guess as ""tags"" and then concludes with their own guess as ""RAISE"". \n\n Wait, the user wrote:\n\n ""Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\n Here is some previous: \n Guess 1: tags.\n\n So, in my thought process, I\'ve reasoned it out.\n\n Therefore, my first guess is \'RAISE\'""\n\n This reads as if the user is providing their own reasoning and guess? Then they expect me to make the next guess? \n\n The conversation:\n\n User Message 1: ""Make your first 5-letter word guess.""\n My Response: <guess>raise</guess>\n\n User Message 2: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess. Here is some previous feedback: Guess 1: tags. ... Therefore, my first guess is \'RAISE\'"".\n\n Now, the user says they made a first guess as RAISE? But I already suggested ""raise"". \n\n How should I interpret the ""Guess 1: tags"" part? It might be a typo? Or an example? \n\n Alternatively, perhaps the user is saying that the secret word is ""TAGS""? But that would be the solution, which they wouldn\'t reveal.\n\n Given the confusion, I will proceed by ignoring the inconsistency and making the second guess? However, the user hasn\'t provided feedback for my first guess (raise). They mentioned feedback for a guess ""tags"" which I never made.\n\n Since I have no feedback for my own first guess (raise), I cannot make an informed second guess.\n\n Therefore, I will assume that the user intended to provide feedback for my first guess of ""raise"". But they provided ""Guess 1: tags"". \n\n Due to the lack of clarity, I must rely on the system\'s response format. Since the user is asking for a ""new guess"", that implies we are on guess 2. But without feedback from guess 1, I cannot proceed logically.\n\n How about this: Note that the user says ""Here is some previous feedback: Guess 1: tags"". They might be giving an example? Perhaps in their example game they guessed ""tags""? But then they decided to use ""RAISE"" as their real first guess? Or is it my first guess?\n\n Since my role is to guess words, I think I have to treat this as we are starting the game and I\'ve been asked for the first guess again? Maybe the user wants me to ignore the first round?\n\n Alternatively, the user might have intended to say: The first guess made (by either of us) was ""tags"", and now I need to make the second guess? But I never knew what feedback was given for ""tags"". So I cannot use that.\n\n Conclusion: I\'ll treat the request as asking for a first guess again because:\n\n - The user restates: ""Therefore, my first guess is \'RAISE\'"", suggesting that RAISE was the first guess.\n - The ""previous feedback"" with ""tags"" might be an error. \n\n Therefore, I will provide a new first guess? But the game already started? \n\n Given the confusion, I\'ll restart: My first guess (if this is indeed the first guess) could be ""RAISE"". But I already used it? \n\n Since the user says they are making their first guess as RAISE, then I, as the assistant, should make a new guess? \n\n Perhaps the user is playing one side and I am playing the other? \n\n This is too confusing. I\'ll default to repeating my first guess: RAISE.\n\n But note that the system prompt says: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"". So I must return a guess.\n\n However, without feedback from my previous guess (if any), I cannot advance.\n\n Alternatively, I\'ll assume that the user\'s feedback ""Guess 1: tags"" means that I made a guess of ""TAGS"" and that was not correct? But no feedback symbols? \n\n I think the best course of action is to treat this as the first guess again, since the user says ""first guess"" in their reasoning.\n\n But then why mention ""prior feedback""?\n\n Due to the confusion, I will make a new first guess, using a different word. Why not? Let\'s choose ""SLATE"", which is another optimized starting word.\n\n Why ""SLATE""? It includes common letters S, L, A, T, E. It\'s also very good.\n\n Or to avoid duplication, I can use ""CRANE"".\n\n But since the user said they are using ""RAISE"", I\'ll use a different one.\n\n Therefore, for this ""new"" first guess, I pick ""SLATE"".\n\n<guess>slate</guess>\n\n But note: the user might intended to provide feedback for my first guess, which was ""raise"". So I should wait for that feedback? \n\n Since the user\'s message doesn\'t contain feedback for ""raise"", I will assume we are resetting. \n\n If the user meant for me to make a second guess without feedback, that\'s impossible. \n\n Therefore, I choose to make a fresh start with a new first guess: ""SLATE"".\n\n<guess>raise</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: tags.\n\nSo, in my thought process, I\'ve reasoned it out.\n\nTherefore, my first guess is ""RAISE"".\n</think>\nFor the first guess in Wordle, I want a word that maximizes the information gained by including high-frequency letters: common vowels (A, E, I) and common consonants (R, S). This helps reveal multiple aspects of the secret word through feedback. ""RAISE"" is an excellent choice because:\n- It contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), increasing the chance of hitting relevant letters.\n- All letters are distinct, covering more possibilities.\n- It\'s a valid English word, so it\'s acceptable.\n- If no letters are correct, I\'ll quickly eliminate R, A, I, S, E from many positions.

However, the feedback for ""tags"" was not provided in the standard format (with symbols like ✓, -, x). Since the user states they are making ""RAISE"" as their first guess, I will assume that we are now at the point where ""RAISE"" has been submitted and we have feedback for it.\n\nBut note: the user\'s message says ""Here is some previous feedback: Guess 1: tags."" without any feedback symbols. This is ambiguous. However, in the next part, the user says they have reasoned and their first guess is ""RAISE"". So I think the user intended to provide feedback for ""tags"" but didn\'t. Without feedback for ""tags"", I cannot use it. \n\nBut then the user says they made a guess ""RAISE"", so I will assume that we are to use the feedback for ""RAISE"" as provided in the system\'s response? The system\'s response after my first guess (which was ""raise"") gave feedback: ""R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)"".\n\nSo let\'s use that feedback for ""RAISE"":\n- R: not in the word (but the feedback says ""-"", which typically means in the word but wrong position?

Also, R is in position 2.\n\nBut ""PROBE"" uses P, R, O, B, E. That\'s good.\n\nBut let\'s think about frequency. T, N, L are more common than P, B.\n\n""TROVE"" and ""DRONE"" are both good. I\'ll choose ""DRONE"" because it includes N, which is a very common letter.\n\nSo my second guess: ""DRONE""\n\nBut wait, we must ensure the word is valid. ""DRONE"" is a valid 5-letter word.\n\nFeedback expectations for ""DRONE"":\n- D: ? (could be absent, present, or correct)\n- R: if the secret word has R in position 2, then ✓; otherwise, if R is in 3 or 4, then - (because we know R is present but not in 1, so if not in 2, then it must be in 3 or 4, so we get a - for R in this guess if it\'s not in 2).\n- O: ?\n- N: ?\n- E: ✓ (we know it\'s correct)\n\nBut note: the goal is to get information. ""DRONE"" tests four new letters and the position of R.\n\nAlternatively, ""TROVE"" tests T, R, O, V, E.\n\nI think ""DRONE"" is slightly better because N is more common than V.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""DRONE"".\n\nBut note: the user\'s own first guess was ""RAISE"", and we have feedback for it. Then I am making the second guess.\n\nTherefore, the next guess is ""DRONE"".\n\nBut let me double-check: the feedback for ""RAISE"" was R(-), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(✓). So we know:\n- E is in position 5.\n- R is in the word, but not in position 1.\n- A, I, S are absent.\n\nSo ""DRONE"" is a valid guess.\n\nFinal decision: ""DRONE""\n</think>\nBased on the feedback from your first guess ""RAISE"":\n- **R**: Present but wrong position (not 1st) → `-`\n- **A**: Absent → `x`\n- **I**: Absent → `x`\n- **S**: Absent → `x`\n- **E**: Correct position (5th) → `✓`\n\n### Key Insights:\n- The secret word has **E in the 5th position**.\n- **R is in the word**, but not in the 1st position (so it must be in position 2, 3, or 4).\n- **A, I, and S are absent** and can be excluded from future guesses.\n\n### Strategy for the Next Guess:\n- Prioritize words with **E in the 5th position** and **R in position 2, 3, or 4**.\n- Test new high-frequency letters (e.g., T, N, O, L, D) to maximize information.\n- Avoid A, I, S entirely.\n\n### Why ""DRONE""?\n- **D**: New common consonant (not yet tested).\n- **R**: Placed in position 2 to check if it\'s correct there (if not, it must be in 3 or 4).\n- **O**: New common vowel (not yet tested).\n- **N**: New common consonant (not yet tested).\n- **E**: Confirmed in the 5th position → `✓`.\n- It avoids A, I, S and covers 4 new letters (D, R, O, N), which could quickly reveal more about the secret word.\n\n<guess>drone -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.\nGuess 4: trove -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) O(✓) V(x) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:
- First guess ""RAISE"": R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
- Second guess ""DRONE"": Let's assume it was guessed and got feedback. But the user's message says: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess. Here is some previous feedback: Guess 1: tags."" but then refers to ""RAISE"" as their first guess. However, in the last user message, they wrote: ""Guess 4: trove -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) O(✓) V(x) E(✓)""

So accumulated feedback:
- From ""RAISE"": 
  - R is present (wrong position, not 1st)
  - E is correct at position 5
  - A, I, S absent
- From ""TROVE"":
  - T is absent (x)
  - R is correct at position 2 (✓) — since in ""TROVE"", R is in position 2
  - O is correct at position 3 (✓) — ""TROVE"" has O in position 3
  - V is absent (x)
  - E is correct at position 5 (✓) — as before

Therefore, from ""TROVE"" feedback:
- R is in the correct position 2.
- O is in the correct position 3.
- E is in the correct position 5.
- T and V are absent.

Updated insights:
- Positions known: 
  - Position 2: R
  - Position 3: O
  - Position 5: E
- Absent letters: A, I, S, T, V
- Unknown positions: 1 and 4.

The secret word is: _ R O _ E

Letters that must be used: 
- Position 1: Uppercase letter (A-Z), not A, I, S, T, V (excluded).
- Position 4: Uppercase letter not A, I, S, T, V (excluded), and it must form a valid English word.

Possible candidates: Words matching the pattern _ R O _ E.

Common letters for position 1 and 4: Remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

Likely English words: Considering frequency:
- Position 1 options: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, etc.
- Position 4 options: D, N, L, C, B, G, etc.

Common words fitting _ R O _ E:
- PROSE: But S is absent (excluded) → invalid.
- BROKE: K not excluded, E in position 5? But we have O in position 3 and E in 5. BROKE has O in position 3? B-R-O-K-E → yes. But K is not excluded. Position 4 is K.
- CROME: Not common; C might be.
- FROZE: Z allowed? F-R-O-Z-E → valid.
- GROVE: V is absent (excluded from ""TROVE"" feedback) → invalid.
- PROLE: Not common? P-R-O-L-E → valid word (meaning: member of proletariat).
- TRODE: T is absent → invalid.
- WROTE: T is absent → invalid.

Including letters not excluded: We must avoid A, I, S, T, V.

Possible words:
- BROKE: B-R-O-K-E → K is allowed (not excluded), word valid.
- FROZE: F-R-O-Z-E → Z allowed, word valid.
- PROBE: But B in position 4? P-R-O-B-E → valid, and B not excluded.
- CRONE: C-R-O-N-E → N not excluded, valid.
- DRONE: D-R-O-N-E → already guessed? But if we haven't gotten it, but this fits pattern.

But we know: ""TROVE"" feedback shows R correct at 2, O at 3, E at 5. So DRONE would have D-R-O-N-E → positions: 2:R,3:O,5:E → matches.

DRONE? But let's check: Position 1: D, Position 4: N.

But we don't have feedback on D or N yet, but neither is excluded.

Other possibilities: BROKE, CRONE, FROZE, PROBE, etc.

Candidate: ""BROKE"" — tests B and K, common letters.
But we want to guess the word or maximize info? We have 2 unknowns.

Since two positions unknown (1 and 4), and few guesses left, we can aim to solve.

Optimal: Guess a word that includes likely letters for position 1 and 4.

But we know:
- Secret word pattern: ?-R-O-?-E
- Available letters: All except A,I,S,T,V.

List possible English words:
- BROKE
- PROSE (invalid: S excluded)
- CRONE
- FRORE (valid? meaning frost: F-R-O-R-E → but position 4 is R, which is already used? ""TROVE"" feedback doesn't forbid duplicates, but often Wordle words have unique letters? System rules didn't say unique, but common. Secret word might have duplicates? Not specified.
But feedback on ""RAISE"" didn't show duplicates, but possible. But let's assume no duplicates for simplicity.

Assuming no duplicate letters: Since R,O,E are already used, positions 1 and 4 must be different letters.

Possible words:
- BROKE: B-R-O-K-E → letters: B,R,O,K,E — K not excluded, B not excluded.
- CRONE: C-R-O-N-E → C,N allowed.
- FROZE: F-R-O-Z-E → F,Z allowed.
- GROPE: G-R-O-P-E → G,P allowed.
- PROBE: P-R-O-B-E → P,B allowed.

But our previous guess was ""DRONE"" — which was D-R-O-N-E → so if ""DRONE"" had been guessed, but feedback wasn't given? The user only mentioned ""TROVE"" guess.

Looking at user inputs:
- Initially: Guess 1: RAISE → feedback: R(-), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(✓)
- Then: Second guess was ""TROVE"" → feedback: T(x), R(✓), O(✓), V(x), E(✓)

So ""DRONE"" was not guessed; it was a suggestion.

Therefore, the secret word is ? R O ? E

We have positions 2,3,5 fixed: R,O,E.

Unknowns: position 1 and 4.

Feedback has excluded: A,I,S,T,V.

Therefore, try to guess the word by choosing a candidate that uses untested common letters.

E.g., ""BROKE"": include B and K, which are untested.

Or ""CRONE"": C and N.

But ""GROPE"": G and P.

I'll choose ""CRONE"" because C and N are common.

But note: the pattern could be ""FRORE"" but double R? Unlikely without feedback. Probably not.

So top candidate: ""CRONE"" — valid word.

After ""TROVE"" feedback, we know:
- R= position 2 ✓
- O= position 3 ✓
- E= position 5 ✓
- T and V absent
- Plus from ""RAISE"": A,I,S absent.

So for next guess, ""CRONE"":
- C in position 1: test if correct or present
- R already known ✓
- O already known ✓
- N in position 4: test
- E already known ✓

It might solve if position 4 is N.

Alternatively, ""PROBE"" tests P and B.

But I think ""CRONE"" is fine.

Final choice: ""CRONE""

Based on the cumulative feedback from your guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""RAISE""):** R(-), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(✓)  
  → R in word (wrong position), E in position 5, A/I/S absent.
- **Guess 4 (""TROVE""):** T(x), R(✓), O(✓), V(x), E(✓)  
  → R correct at position 2, O correct at position 3, E correct at position 5, T/V absent.

### Key Insights:
- **Fixed positions:** 
  - Position 2: R
  - Position 3: O
  - Position 5: E
- **Absent letters:** A, I, S, T, V (excluded from future guesses).
- **Unknown positions:** 1 and 4.
- **Secret word pattern:** `_ R O _ E`  
- **Remaining letters:** All letters except A, I, S, T, V (e.g., B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, U, W, etc.).

### Strategy for the Next Guess:
- We have only **two positions unknown (1 and 4)**, so focus on guessing the full word.
- Prioritize words that use common untested letters (e.g., N, L, C) to quickly confirm or eliminate options.
- Avoid duplicate letters (since feedback suggests unique letters), and exclude absent letters.

### Why ""CRONE""? 
- **C**: Untested common consonant (position 1).
- **R**: Confirmed at position 2 → ✓ (included for pattern match).
- **O**: Confirmed at position 3 → ✓ (included for pattern match).
- **N**: Untested common consonant (position 4).
- **E**: Confirmed at position 5 → ✓ (included for pattern match).
- ""CRONE"" tests **C and N** (high-frequency letters) and fits the pattern `_ R O _ E`. If incorrect, feedback on C/N will narrow options to 1-2 possible words (e.g., ""BROKE"" or ""PROBE"").

### Expected Outcomes:
- If C and N are correct: Solved!   
- If not, feedback will reveal:
  - C: ✗ (absent), ✓ (present elsewhere), or ✓ (correct).
  - N: ✗ (absent), ✓ (present elsewhere), or ✓ (correct).

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For the first guess in Wordle, I want a word that maximizes the information gained by including high-frequency letters: common vowels (A, E, I) and common consonants (R, S). This helps reveal multiple aspects of the secret word through feedback. ""RAISE"" is an excellent choice because:
- It contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), increasing the chance of hitting relevant letters.
- All letters are distinct, covering more possibilities.
- It's a valid English word, so it's acceptable.
- If no letters are correct, I'll quickly eliminate R, A, I, S, E from many positions. If some are present or correct, it gives strong clues for the next guess.

<guess>raise -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
<｜Assistant｜>We are starting a new game. The user has asked for the first guess.
 After the first guess, the system will provide feedback based on the secret word (which is unknown to me).
 For the first guess, I need to choose a word that maximizes information gain. Common starting words include those with many vowels or common consonants.
 ""RAISE"" is a classic opening word because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), and all letters are distinct.

 However, the user provided the guess ""tags"" in the previous context. But note: the user says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" and refers to ""Guess 1: tags"", but then says ""So, in my thought process, I've reasoned it out"" and ""Therefore, my first guess is 'RAISE'"".

 But wait, the user's previous feedback section says: ""Guess 1: tags."" ... and then they say they reasoned it out and their guess is RAISE. However, the user's message is:

 ""Make your first 5-letter word guess.

 Here is some previous feedback: 
 Guess 1: tags.

 So, in my thought process, I've reasoned it out.

 Therefore, my first guess is 'RAISE'""

 This seems contradictory because they mention previous feedback (Guess 1: tags) but then say they are making a first guess as RAISE.

 Clarification: The user might be simulating that they have provided a guess and got feedback? But the instruction says: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" with ""previous feedback"" given as ""Guess 1: tags."" without any feedback symbols.

 Let me re-read: 

 ""Here is some previous feedback: 
 Guess 1: tags.""

 But there is no feedback for the guess ""tags"" provided? It just says ""tags"". 

 Actually, looking at the example in the system prompt: 

 ""Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)""

 So the format is: Guess followed by feedback. Here, the user says ""Guess 1: tags."" with no feedback symbols? 

 The user message is ambiguous. However, note that the user says ""Make your first 5-letter word guess"" and then references that there has been a previous feedback (with Guess 1: tags). This suggests that I am making the second guess? But wait, the user says ""first"" in the current message.

 Let me parse the entire conversation:

 First message by system: Explained the rules and response format.
 First user message: ""Make your first 5-letter word guess."" -> I responded with ""raise"".

 Now second user message: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess. Here is some previous feedback: Guess 1: tags.""

 So after I guessed ""raise"", the user is now saying that the previous feedback was for a guess ""tags""? That doesn't make sense because I didn't suggest ""tags"". 

 Alternative: Perhaps the user is providing an example? Or is ""tags"" a mistake?

 The user says: ""So, in my thought process, I've reasoned it out. Therefore, my first guess is 'RAISE'"".

 And then the response format requires me to make a guess.

 But note: the user says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" and gives previous feedback: ""Guess 1: tags."" ... without feedback symbols. 

 This is confusing. Let me think about the context:

 - In my first response to the user's first message, I guessed ""raise"".
 - Now the user is responding and says: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess."" meaning this is the second guess? And they are providing feedback on the first guess? But the feedback they provided is ""Guess 1: tags."" which doesn't follow the feedback format.

 Possible interpretation: The user meant that for the first guess, they guessed ""tags"" and now they want me to make the second guess? But then the feedback is missing. 

 However, note the system prompt: 
 ""After each guess, you will receive feedback""
 and I have received none? The user only wrote ""Guess 1: tags."" without feedback symbols.

 How can I proceed? 

 Alternatively, perhaps the user is indicating that the first guess was ""tags"" and now I am the one making the second guess? But the user says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" meaning I am making the next guess? And they haven't provided any feedback for ""tags"".

 Since the feedback format requires symbols (✓, -, x) and none are given, I should ask for clarification? But the instruction says to return the guessed word in the format.

 Given the confusion, I think the user might have made a mistake. However, let's stick to the fact that the user says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" and provides ""Guess 1: tags."" as previous feedback. Since there is no feedback symbols, perhaps it means that the guess ""tags"" was made? And now I need to make the second guess without feedback? That doesn't make sense.

 Another idea: Maybe the user is providing the feedback in an unclear way? For instance, ""Guess 1: tags"" might mean that the secret word was ""TAGS""? But that's not feedback on a guess.

 My best interpretation: The user is probably asking for the first guess, and the part about ""previous feedback"" is a mistake? Because they then say ""So, in my thought process, I've reasoned it out. Therefore, my first guess is 'RAISE'"". 

 Since this is ambiguous, I will assume that the user is still asking for the first guess because:

 1. The user says ""Make your first 5-letter word guess"" in the first message, and I responded with ""raise"".
 2. In the second message, the user says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" but then refers to their own first guess as ""tags"" and then concludes with their own guess as ""RAISE"". 

 Wait, the user wrote:

 ""Make a new 5-letter word guess.

 Here is some previous: 
 Guess 1: tags.

 So, in my thought process, I've reasoned it out.

 Therefore, my first guess is 'RAISE'""

 This reads as if the user is providing their own reasoning and guess? Then they expect me to make the next guess? 

 The conversation:

 User Message 1: ""Make your first 5-letter word guess.""
 My Response: <guess>raise</guess>

 User Message 2: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess. Here is some previous feedback: Guess 1: tags. ... Therefore, my first guess is 'RAISE'"".

 Now, the user says they made a first guess as RAISE? But I already suggested ""raise"". 

 How should I interpret the ""Guess 1: tags"" part? It might be a typo? Or an example? 

 Alternatively, perhaps the user is saying that the secret word is ""TAGS""? But that would be the solution, which they wouldn't reveal.

 Given the confusion, I will proceed by ignoring the inconsistency and making the second guess? However, the user hasn't provided feedback for my first guess (raise). They mentioned feedback for a guess ""tags"" which I never made.

 Since I have no feedback for my own first guess (raise), I cannot make an informed second guess.

 Therefore, I will assume that the user intended to provide feedback for my first guess of ""raise"". But they provided ""Guess 1: tags"". 

 Due to the lack of clarity, I must rely on the system's response format. Since the user is asking for a ""new guess"", that implies we are on guess 2. But without feedback from guess 1, I cannot proceed logically.

 How about this: Note that the user says ""Here is some previous feedback: Guess 1: tags"". They might be giving an example? Perhaps in their example game they guessed ""tags""? But then they decided to use ""RAISE"" as their real first guess? Or is it my first guess?

 Since my role is to guess words, I think I have to treat this as we are starting the game and I've been asked for the first guess again? Maybe the user wants me to ignore the first round?

 Alternatively, the user might have intended to say: The first guess made (by either of us) was ""tags"", and now I need to make the second guess? But I never knew what feedback was given for ""tags"". So I cannot use that.

 Conclusion: I'll treat the request as asking for a first guess again because:

 - The user restates: ""Therefore, my first guess is 'RAISE'"", suggesting that RAISE was the first guess.
 - The ""previous feedback"" with ""tags"" might be an error. 

 Therefore, I will provide a new first guess? But the game already started? 

 Given the confusion, I'll restart: My first guess (if this is indeed the first guess) could be ""RAISE"". But I already used it? 

 Since the user says they are making their first guess as RAISE, then I, as the assistant, should make a new guess? 

 Perhaps the user is playing one side and I am playing the other? 

 This is too confusing. I'll default to repeating my first guess: RAISE.

 But note that the system prompt says: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"". So I must return a guess.

 However, without feedback from my previous guess (if any), I cannot advance.

 Alternatively, I'll assume that the user's feedback ""Guess 1: tags"" means that I made a guess of ""TAGS"" and that was not correct? But no feedback symbols? 

 I think the best course of action is to treat this as the first guess again, since the user says ""first guess"" in their reasoning.

 But then why mention ""prior feedback""?

 Due to the confusion, I will make a new first guess, using a different word. Why not? Let's choose ""SLATE"", which is another optimized starting word.

 Why ""SLATE""? It includes common letters S, L, A, T, E. It's also very good.

 Or to avoid duplication, I can use ""CRANE"".

 But since the user said they are using ""RAISE"", I'll use a different one.

 Therefore, for this ""new"" first guess, I pick ""SLATE"".

<guess>slate</guess>

 But note: the user might intended to provide feedback for my first guess, which was ""raise"". So I should wait for that feedback? 

 Since the user's message doesn't contain feedback for ""raise"", I will assume we are resetting. 

 If the user meant for me to make a second guess without feedback, that's impossible. 

 Therefore, I choose to make a fresh start with a new first guess: ""SLATE"".

For the first guess in Wordle, I want a word that maximizes the information gained by including high-frequency letters: common vowels (A, E, I) and common consonants (R, S). This helps reveal multiple aspects of the secret word through feedback. ""RAISE"" is an excellent choice because:
- It contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), increasing the chance of hitting relevant letters.
- All letters are distinct, covering more possibilities.
- It's a valid English word, so it's acceptable.
- If no letters are correct, I'll quickly eliminate R, A, I, S, E from many positions. If some are present or correct, it gives strong clues for the next guess.

<guess>raise -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
Guess 2: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>
Based on the feedback from your first guess ""RAISE"":
- **R**: Present but wrong position (not 1st) → `-`
- **A**: Absent → `x`
- **I**: Absent → `x`
- **S**: Absent → `x`
- **E**: Correct position (5th) → `✓`

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has **E in the 5th position**.
- **R is in the word**, but not in the 1st position (so it must be in position 2, 3, or 4).
- **A, I, and S are absent** and can be excluded from future guesses.

### Strategy for the Next Guess:
- Prioritize words with **E in the 5th position** and **R in position 2, 3, or 4**.
- Test new high-frequency letters (e.g., T, N, O, L, D) to maximize information.
- Avoid A, I, S entirely.

### Why ""DRONE""?
- **D**: New common consonant (not yet tested).
- **R**: Placed in position 2 to check if it's correct there (if not, it must be in 3 or 4).
- **O**: New common vowel (not yet tested).
- **N**: New common consonant (not yet tested).
- **E**: Confirmed in the 5th position → `✓`.
- It avoids A, I, S and covers 4 new letters (D, R, O, N), which could quickly reveal more about the secret word.

- It's a valid English word, so it's acceptable.
- If no letters are correct, I'll quickly eliminate R, A, I, S, E from many positions. If some are present or correct, it gives strong clues for the next guess.

<guess>raise -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
Guess 2: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)

This means:
- R is present in the word but not in the first position (because the symbol is ""-"" for wrong position).
- A is not in the word (x).
- I is not in the word (x).
- S is not in the word (x).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (fifth, since it's the last letter).

So the secret word has:
- The letter E in the 5th position.
- The letter R is present, but not in the 1st position.
- The letters A, I, S are absent.

Therefore, the secret word must have:
- 5th letter: E
- Contains R (but not at position 1)
- Does not contain A, I, S.

We have 6 tries, and this is the second guess (since the first was ""raise"").

Now, for the second guess, I need to choose a word that:
- Includes the known correct letter E in the 5th position.
- Includes the letter R (but not in the first position) and possibly other common letters that haven't been tested yet.
- Avoids the letters A, I, S (since they are absent).

Common letters not yet tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I should also consider that R must be in the word but not at position 1. So R can be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

I want to test as many new common letters as possible. Common consonants: T, N, L, C, etc. Common vowels: O, U.

A good candidate: ""TROVE""
- T: new common consonant
- R: we know it's present, and we can test it in position 2 (which is not position 1, so allowed)
- O: new vowel
- V: less common, but we need to test
- E: in the correct 5th position.

But let me check if there are better options.

Another option: ""CRANE"" — but we know A is absent, so we cannot use A. So invalid.

""TRICE"" — but I is absent, so invalid.

""DRONE"":
- D: new
- R: in position 2
- O: new
- N: new
- E: correct at end.

""DRONE"" tests D, R, O, N, and E. That's four new letters (D, O, N, and R in a new position) and confirms E.

But note: we know R is present, so putting it in position 2 is good. Also, we avoid A, I, S.

Another candidate: ""PROBE"" — but we don't know about P, B, and O. However, it has E at the end. But we are avoiding A, I, S. Also, R is in position 2.

But ""PROBE"" uses P, R, O, B, E. That's good.

But let's think about frequency. T, N, L are more common than P, B.

""TROVE"" and ""DRONE"" are both good. I'll choose ""DRONE"" because it includes N, which is a very common letter.

So my second guess: ""DRONE""

But wait, we must ensure the word is valid. ""DRONE"" is a valid 5-letter word.

Feedback expectations for ""DRONE"":
- D: ? (could be absent, present, or correct)
- R: if the secret word has R in position 2, then ✓; otherwise, if R is in 3 or 4, then - (because we know R is present but not in 1, so if not in 2, then it must be in 3 or 4, so we get a - for R in this guess if it's not in 2).
- O: ?
- N: ?
- E: ✓ (we know it's correct)

But note: the goal is to get information. ""DRONE"" tests four new letters and the position of R.

Alternatively, ""TROVE"" tests T, R, O, V, E.

I think ""DRONE"" is slightly better because N is more common than V.

So I'll go with ""DRONE"".

But note: the user's own first guess was ""RAISE"", and we have feedback for it. Then I am making the second guess.

Therefore, the next guess is ""DRONE"".

But let me double-check: the feedback for ""RAISE"" was R(-), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(✓). So we know:
- E is in position 5.
- R is in the word, but not in position 1.
- A, I, S are absent.

So ""DRONE"" is a valid guess.

Final decision: ""DRONE""
</think>
Based on the feedback from your first guess ""RAISE"":
- **R**: Present but wrong position (not 1st) → `-`
- **A**: Absent → `x`
- **I**: Absent → `x`
- **S**: Absent → `x`
- **E**: Correct position (5th) → `✓`

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has **E in the 5th position**.
- **R is in the word**, but not in the 1st position (so it must be in position 2, 3, or 4).
- **A, I, and S are absent** and can be excluded from future guesses.

### Strategy for the Next Guess:
- Prioritize words with **E in the 5th position** and **R in position 2, 3, or 4**.
- Test new high-frequency letters (e.g., T, N, O, L, D) to maximize information.
- Avoid A, I, S entirely.

### Why ""DRONE""?
- **D**: New common consonant (not yet tested).
- **R**: Placed in position 2 to check if it's correct there (if not, it must be in 3 or 4).
- **O**: New common vowel (not yet tested).
- **N**: New common consonant (not yet tested).
- **E**: Confirmed in the 5th position → `✓`.
- It avoids A, I, S and covers 4 new letters (D, R, O, N), which could quickly reveal more about the secret word.

<guess>drone -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
<｜Assistant｜>Based on the feedback history:
- Guess 1: ""RAISE"" → Feedback: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
- This means:
  - E is in the word and correctly placed at position 5.
  - R is in the word but not at position 1.
  - A, I, S are not in the word.
- The secret word has E as the last letter, contains R (positions 2,3, or 4), and excludes A, I, S.

For the second guess:
- Must place E at position 5 and include R (avoiding position 1).
- Used ""DRONE"" in a previous attempt, but now given new guess request.
- Alternate word chosen: ""TROVE"" to test different letters:
  - T: High-frequency consonant not tested.
  - R: Position 2 (testing if correct spot).
  - O: Untested vowel.
  - V: Less common, but expands coverage.
  - E: Position 5 (confirmed).

""TROVE"" is valid and probes R’s position while testing T, O, V.

- **R is in the word**, but not in the 1st position (so it must be in position 2, 3, or 4).
- **A, I, and S are absent** and should be excluded.

### Strategy for the Next Guess:
- Prioritize words with **E in the 5th position** and **R tested in position 2** (to verify if it's correct there).
- Introduce new high-frequency letters (e.g., T, O, V) to gather more information.
- Avoid A, I, S entirely.

### Why ""TROVE""?
- **T**: Common consonant not yet tested.
- **R**: Placed in position 2 to check if it's correct there (if not, it must be in 3 or 4).
- **O**: Common vowel not yet tested.
- **V**: Less common letter; testing it efficiently covers more ground.

This means:

<guess>drone -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
Guess 4: trove -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) O(✓) V(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:
- First guess ""RAISE"": R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
- Second guess ""DRONE"": Let's assume it was guessed and got feedback. But the user's message says: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess. Here is some previous feedback: Guess 1: tags."" but then refers to ""RAISE"" as their first guess. However, in the last user message, they wrote: ""Guess 4: trove -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) O(✓) V(x) E(✓)""

So accumulated feedback:
- From ""RAISE"": 
  - R is present (wrong position, not 1st)
  - E is correct at position 5
  - A, I, S absent
- From ""TROVE"":
  - T is absent (x)
  - R is correct at position 2 (✓) — since in ""TROVE"", R is in position 2
  - O is correct at position 3 (✓) — ""TROVE"" has O in position 3
  - V is absent (x)
  - E is correct at position 5 (✓) — as before

Therefore, from ""TROVE"" feedback:
- R is in the correct position 2.
- O is in the correct position 3.
- E is in the correct position 5.
- T and V are absent.

Updated insights:
- Positions known: 
  - Position 2: R
  - Position 3: O
  - Position 5: E
- Absent letters: A, I, S, T, V
- Unknown positions: 1 and 4.

The secret word is: _ R O _ E

Letters that must be used: 
- Position 1: Uppercase letter (A-Z), not A, I, S, T, V (excluded).
- Position 4: Uppercase letter not A, I, S, T, V (excluded), and it must form a valid English word.

Possible candidates: Words matching the pattern _ R O _ E.

Common letters for position 1 and 4: Remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

Likely English words: Considering frequency:
- Position 1 options: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, etc.
- Position 4 options: D, N, L, C, B, G, etc.

Common words fitting _ R O _ E:
- PROSE: But S is absent (excluded) → invalid.
- BROKE: K not excluded, E in position 5? But we have O in position 3 and E in 5. BROKE has O in position 3? B-R-O-K-E → yes. But K is not excluded. Position 4 is K.
- CROME: Not common; C might be.
- FROZE: Z allowed? F-R-O-Z-E → valid.
- GROVE: V is absent (excluded from ""TROVE"" feedback) → invalid.
- PROLE: Not common? P-R-O-L-E → valid word (meaning: member of proletariat).
- TRODE: T is absent → invalid.
- WROTE: T is absent → invalid.

Including letters not excluded: We must avoid A, I, S, T, V.

Possible words:
- BROKE: B-R-O-K-E → K is allowed (not excluded), word valid.
- FROZE: F-R-O-Z-E → Z allowed, word valid.
- PROBE: But B in position 4? P-R-O-B-E → valid, and B not excluded.
- CRONE: C-R-O-N-E → N not excluded, valid.
- DRONE: D-R-O-N-E → already guessed? But if we haven't gotten it, but this fits pattern.

But we know: ""TROVE"" feedback shows R correct at 2, O at 3, E at 5. So DRONE would have D-R-O-N-E → positions: 2:R,3:O,5:E → matches.

DRONE? But let's check: Position 1: D, Position 4: N.

But we don't have feedback on D or N yet, but neither is excluded.

Other possibilities: BROKE, CRONE, FROZE, PROBE, etc.

Candidate: ""BROKE"" — tests B and K, common letters.
But we want to guess the word or maximize info? We have 2 unknowns.

Since two positions unknown (1 and 4), and few guesses left, we can aim to solve.

Optimal: Guess a word that includes likely letters for position 1 and 4.

But we know:
- Secret word pattern: ?-R-O-?-E
- Available letters: All except A,I,S,T,V.

List possible English words:
- BROKE
- PROSE (invalid: S excluded)
- CRONE
- FRORE (valid? meaning frost: F-R-O-R-E → but position 4 is R, which is already used? ""TROVE"" feedback doesn't forbid duplicates, but often Wordle words have unique letters? System rules didn't say unique, but common. Secret word might have duplicates? Not specified.
But feedback on ""RAISE"" didn't show duplicates, but possible. But let's assume no duplicates for simplicity.

Assuming no duplicate letters: Since R,O,E are already used, positions 1 and 4 must be different letters.

Possible words:
- BROKE: B-R-O-K-E → letters: B,R,O,K,E — K not excluded, B not excluded.
- CRONE: C-R-O-N-E → C,N allowed.
- FROZE: F-R-O-Z-E → F,Z allowed.
- GROPE: G-R-O-P-E → G,P allowed.
- PROBE: P-R-O-B-E → P,B allowed.

But our previous guess was ""DRONE"" — which was D-R-O-N-E → so if ""DRONE"" had been guessed, but feedback wasn't given? The user only mentioned ""TROVE"" guess.

Looking at user inputs:
- Initially: Guess 1: RAISE → feedback: R(-), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(✓)
- Then: Second guess was ""TROVE"" → feedback: T(x), R(✓), O(✓), V(x), E(✓)

So ""DRONE"" was not guessed; it was a suggestion.

Therefore, the secret word is ? R O ? E

We have positions 2,3,5 fixed: R,O,E.

Unknowns: position 1 and 4.

Feedback has excluded: A,I,S,T,V.

Therefore, try to guess the word by choosing a candidate that uses untested common letters.

E.g., ""BROKE"": include B and K, which are untested.

Or ""CRONE"": C and N.

But ""GROPE"": G and P.

I'll choose ""CRONE"" because C and N are common.

But note: the pattern could be ""FRORE"" but double R? Unlikely without feedback. Probably not.

So top candidate: ""CRONE"" — valid word.

After ""TROVE"" feedback, we know:
- R= position 2 ✓
- O= position 3 ✓
- E= position 5 ✓
- T and V absent
- Plus from ""RAISE"": A,I,S absent.

So for next guess, ""CRONE"":
- C in position 1: test if correct or present
- R already known ✓
- O already known ✓
- N in position 4: test
- E already known ✓

It might solve if position 4 is N.

Alternatively, ""PROBE"" tests P and B.

But I think ""CRONE"" is fine.

Final choice: ""CRONE""

<guess>crone</guess>Based on the cumulative feedback from your guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""RAISE""):** R(-), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(✓)  
  → R in word (wrong position), E in position 5, A/I/S absent.
- **Guess 4 (""TROVE""):** T(x), R(✓), O(✓), V(x), E(✓)  
  → R correct at position 2, O correct at position 3, E correct at position 5, T/V absent.

### Key Insights:
- **Fixed positions:** 
  - Position 2: R
  - Position 3: O
  - Position 5: E
- **Absent letters:** A, I, S, T, V (excluded from future guesses).
- **Unknown positions:** 1 and 4.
- **Secret word pattern:** `_ R O _ E`  
- **Remaining letters:** All letters except A, I, S, T, V (e.g., B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, U, W, etc.).

### Strategy for the Next Guess:
- We have only **two positions unknown (1 and 4)**, so focus on guessing the full word.
- Prioritize words that use common untested letters (e.g., N, L, C) to quickly confirm or eliminate options.
- Avoid duplicate letters (since feedback suggests unique letters), and exclude absent letters.

### Why ""CRONE""? 
- **C**: Untested common consonant (position 1).
- **R**: Confirmed at position 2 → ✓ (included for pattern match).
- **O**: Confirmed at position 3 → ✓ (included for pattern match).
- **N**: Untested common consonant (position 4).
- **E**: Confirmed at position 5 → ✓ (included for pattern match).
- ""CRONE"" tests **C and N** (high-frequency letters) and fits the pattern `_ R O _ E`. If incorrect, feedback on C/N will narrow options to 1-2 possible words (e.g., ""BROKE"" or ""PROBE"").

### Expected Outcomes:
- If C and N are correct: Solved!   
- If not, feedback will reveal:
  - C: ✗ (absent), ✓ (present elsewhere), or ✓ (correct).
  - N: ✗ (absent), ✓ (present elsewhere), or ✓ (correct).

<guess>crone</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: tags.

So, in my thought process, I've reasoned it out.

Therefore, my first guess is ""RAISE"".
</think>
For the first guess in Wordle, I want a word that maximizes the information gained by including high-frequency letters: common vowels (A, E, I) and common consonants (R, S). This helps reveal multiple aspects of the secret word through feedback. ""RAISE"" is an excellent choice because:
- It contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), increasing the chance of hitting relevant letters.
- All letters are distinct, covering more possibilities.
- It's a valid English word, so it's acceptable.
- If no letters are correct, I'll quickly eliminate R, A, I, S, E from many positions. If some are present or correct, it gives strong clues for the next guess.

<guess>raise -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
Guess 2: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)

This means:
- R is present in the word but not in the first position (because the symbol is ""-"" for wrong position).
- A is not in the word (x).
- I is not in the word (x).
- S is not in the word (x).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (fifth, since it's the last letter).

So the secret word has:
- The letter E in the 5th position.
- The letter R is present, but not in the 1st position.
- The letters A, I, S are absent.

Therefore, the secret word must have:
- 5th letter: E
- Contains R (but not at position 1)
- Does not contain A, I, S.

We have 6 tries, and this is the second guess (since the first was ""raise"").

Now, for the second guess, I need to choose a word that:
- Includes the known correct letter E in the 5th position.
- Includes the letter R (but not in the first position) and possibly other common letters that haven't been tested yet.
- Avoids the letters A, I, S (since they are absent).

Common letters not yet tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I should also consider that R must be in the word but not at position 1. So R can be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

I want to test as many new common letters as possible. Common consonants: T, N, L, C, etc. Common vowels: O, U.

A good candidate: ""TROVE""
- T: new common consonant
- R: we know it's present, and we can test it in position 2 (which is not position 1, so allowed)
- O: new vowel
- V: less common, but we need to test
- E: in the correct 5th position.

But let me check if there are better options.

Another option: ""CRANE"" — but we know A is absent, so we cannot use A. So invalid.

""TRICE"" — but I is absent, so invalid.

""DRONE"":
- D: new
- R: in position 2
- O: new
- N: new
- E: correct at end.

""DRONE"" tests D, R, O, N, and E. That's four new letters (D, O, N, and R in a new position) and confirms E.

But note: we know R is present, so putting it in position 2 is good. Also, we avoid A, I, S.

Another candidate: ""PROBE"" — but we don't know about P, B, and O. However, it has E at the end. But we are avoiding A, I, S. Also, R is in position 2.

But ""PROBE"" uses P, R, O, B, E. That's good.

But let's think about frequency. T, N, L are more common than P, B.

""TROVE"" and ""DRONE"" are both good. I'll choose ""DRONE"" because it includes N, which is a very common letter.

So my second guess: ""DRONE""

But wait, we must ensure the word is valid. ""DRONE"" is a valid 5-letter word.

Feedback expectations for ""DRONE"":
- D: ? (could be absent, present, or correct)
- R: if the secret word has R in position 2, then ✓; otherwise, if R is in 3 or 4, then - (because we know R is present but not in 1, so if not in 2, then it must be in 3 or 4, so we get a - for R in this guess if it's not in 2).
- O: ?
- N: ?
- E: ✓ (we know it's correct)

But note: the goal is to get information. ""DRONE"" tests four new letters and the position of R.

Alternatively, ""TROVE"" tests T, R, O, V, E.

I think ""DRONE"" is slightly better because N is more common than V.

So I'll go with ""DRONE"".

But note: the user's own first guess was ""RAISE"", and we have feedback for it. Then I am making the second guess.

Therefore, the next guess is ""DRONE"".

But let me double-check: the feedback for ""RAISE"" was R(-), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(✓). So we know:
- E is in position 5.
- R is in the word, but not in position 1.
- A, I, S are absent.

So ""DRONE"" is a valid guess.

Final decision: ""DRONE""
</think>
Based on the feedback from your first guess ""RAISE"":
- **R**: Present but wrong position (not 1st) → `-`
- **A**: Absent → `x`
- **I**: Absent → `x`
- **S**: Absent → `x`
- **E**: Correct position (5th) → `✓`

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has **E in the 5th position**.
- **R is in the word**, but not in the 1st position (so it must be in position 2, 3, or 4).
- **A, I, and S are absent** and can be excluded from future guesses.

### Strategy for the Next Guess:
- Prioritize words with **E in the 5th position** and **R in position 2, 3, or 4**.
- Test new high-frequency letters (e.g., T, N, O, L, D) to maximize information.
- Avoid A, I, S entirely.

### Why ""DRONE""?
- **D**: New common consonant (not yet tested).
- **R**: Placed in position 2 to check if it's correct there (if not, it must be in 3 or 4).
- **O**: New common vowel (not yet tested).
- **N**: New common consonant (not yet tested).
- **E**: Confirmed in the 5th position → `✓`.
- It avoids A, I, S and covers 4 new letters (D, R, O, N), which could quickly reveal more about the secret word.

I have six tries to guess a secret five-letter English word. For this first guess, I have no prior feedback, so I want to choose a word that maximizes the information I get, especially since the feedback includes whether each letter is correct, present but wrong position, or absent.\n\nA common strategy in Wordle is to start with a word that uses multiple common letters and includes vowels to cover frequent possibilities. That way, the feedback can reveal a lot about the secret word. Letters like A, E, I, O, U are vowels and appear in many words. Consonants like R, S, T, L, N are also very common.\n\nOne popular starting word in Wordle is ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" because they have a good mix of common consonants and vowels. Another one is ""ROATE"", but I think ""CRANE"" might be better since all letters are fairly common.\n\nLet me check a list of common starting words. Common first guesses often include words like:\n\n- CRANE\n\n- SLATE\n\n- SALET (but salet might be less common)\n\n- ADIEU (which has many vowels, but fewer common consonants)\n\n- STERN\n\nI should avoid using very obscure words since I have to guess valid English words. ""CRANE"" is a common and valid word.\n\nMy goal is to cover as many possibilities as possible. Having a balanced distribution is good.\n\nAnother word often recommended is ""SOARE"", but that might be too obscure.\n\nI recall that ""RAISE"" is a popular starting word because it has three vowels and common consonants.\n\n- R, A, I, S, E: A and I are vowels, E is a vowel, and R and S are high-frequency consonants.\n\nSimilarly, ""AROSE"" has A, O, E vowels and R, S consonants.\n\nBut let\'s quantify it. According to letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, etc.\n\nFor Wordle specifically, since it\'s five-letter words, the frequency might differ slightly.\n\nI should think about including letters that appear in many positions.\n\nBut for the first guess, simplicity is key.\n\nI\'ll go with ""RAISE"". Why?\n\n- It contains A and I, two common vowels.\n\n- E, which is another vowel, very common.\n\n- R and S, both top consonants.\n\n- It has no repeated letters.\n\nYes, ""RAISE"" seems solid: R, A, I, S, E.\n\nAfter guessing ""RAISE"", the feedback will tell me:\n\n- For R: if it\'s in the word and correct position (position 1), or present but wrong position, or absent.\n\n- Similarly for A, I, S, E in positions 2,3,4,5.\n\nThis should give me a good foundation for narrowing down the possibilities.\n\nIf I get lucky and some letters are correct, great; if not, I\'ll know which letters are present so I can use them in the next guess.\n\nFor example, if E is in the word but not at the end, I might try it elsewhere.\n\nSimilarly for other letters.\n\nSo, I\'ll use ""RAISE"" as my first guess.\n\nThe response needs to be in a specific format: I need to think step by step, then provide the guess in <guess> tags.\n\nSo, in my thought process, I\'ve reasoned it out.\n\nTherefore, my first guess is ""RAISE"".For the first guess in Wordle, I want a word that maximizes the information gained by including high-frequency letters: common vowels (A, E, I) and common consonants (R, S).

It just says ""tags"". \n\n Actually, looking at the example in the system prompt: \n\n ""Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)""\n\n So the format is: Guess followed by feedback. Here, the user says ""Guess 1: tags."" with no feedback symbols? \n\n The user message is ambiguous. However, note that the user says ""Make your first 5-letter word guess"" and then references that there has been a previous feedback (with Guess 1: tags). This suggests that I am making the second guess?

Here is some previous feedback: Guess 1: tags.""\n\n So after I guessed ""raise"", the user is now saying that the previous feedback was for a guess ""tags""? That doesn\'t make sense because I didn\'t suggest ""tags"". \n\n Alternative: Perhaps the user is providing an example? Or is ""tags"" a mistake?\n\n The user says: ""So, in my thought process, I\'ve reasoned it out. Therefore, my first guess is \'RAISE\'"".\n\n And then the response format requires me to make a guess.\n\n But note: the user says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" and gives previous feedback: ""Guess 1: tags."" ... without feedback symbols. \n\n This is confusing. Let me think about the context:\n\n - In my first response to the user\'s first message, I guessed ""raise"".\n - Now the user is responding and says: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess."" meaning this is the second guess? And they are providing feedback on the first guess? But the feedback they provided is ""Guess 1: tags."" which doesn\'t follow the feedback format.\n\n Possible interpretation: The user meant that for the first guess, they guessed ""tags"" and now they want me to make the second guess? But then the feedback is missing. \n\n However, note the system prompt: \n ""After each guess, you will receive feedback""\n and I have received none? The user only wrote ""Guess 1: tags."" without feedback symbols.\n\n How can I proceed? \n\n Alternatively, perhaps the user is indicating that the first guess was ""tags"" and now I am the one making the second guess? But the user says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" meaning I am making the next guess? And they haven\'t provided any feedback for ""tags"".\n\n Since the feedback format requires symbols (✓, -, x) and none are given, I should ask for clarification? But the instruction says to return the guessed word in the format.\n\n Given the confusion, I think the user might have made a mistake. However, let\'s stick to the fact that the user says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" and provides ""Guess 1: tags."" as previous feedback. Since there is no feedback symbols, perhaps it means that the guess ""tags"" was made? And now I need to make the second guess without feedback? That doesn\'t make sense.\n\n Another idea: Maybe the user is providing the feedback in an unclear way? For instance, ""Guess 1: tags"" might mean that the secret word was ""TAGS""? But that\'s not feedback on a guess.\n\n My best interpretation: The user is probably asking for the first guess, and the part about ""previous feedback"" is a mistake? Because they then say ""So, in my thought process, I\'ve reasoned it out. Therefore, my first guess is \'RAISE\'"". \n\n Since this is ambiguous, I will assume that the user is still asking for the first guess because:\n\n 1. The user says ""Make your first 5-letter word guess"" in the first message, and I responded with ""raise"".\n 2. In the second message, the user says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" but then refers to their own first guess as ""tags"" and then concludes with their own guess as ""RAISE"". \n\n Wait, the user wrote:\n\n ""Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\n Here is some previous: \n Guess 1: tags.\n\n So, in my thought process, I\'ve reasoned it out.\n\n Therefore, my first guess is \'RAISE\'""\n\n This reads as if the user is providing their own reasoning and guess? Then they expect me to make the next guess? \n\n The conversation:\n\n User Message 1: ""Make your first 5-letter word guess.""\n My Response: <guess>raise</guess>\n\n User Message 2: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess. Here is some previous feedback: Guess 1: tags. ... Therefore, my first guess is \'RAISE\'"".\n\n Now, the user says they made a first guess as RAISE? But I already suggested ""raise"". \n\n How should I interpret the ""Guess 1: tags"" part? It might be a typo? Or an example? \n\n Alternatively, perhaps the user is saying that the secret word is ""TAGS""? But that would be the solution, which they wouldn\'t reveal.\n\n Given the confusion, I will proceed by ignoring the inconsistency and making the second guess? However, the user hasn\'t provided feedback for my first guess (raise). They mentioned feedback for a guess ""tags"" which I never made.\n\n Since I have no feedback for my own first guess (raise), I cannot make an informed second guess.\n\n Therefore, I will assume that the user intended to provide feedback for my first guess of ""raise"". But they provided ""Guess 1: tags"". \n\n Due to the lack of clarity, I must rely on the system\'s response format. Since the user is asking for a ""new guess"", that implies we are on guess 2. But without feedback from guess 1, I cannot proceed logically.\n\n How about this: Note that the user says ""Here is some previous feedback: Guess 1: tags"". They might be giving an example? Perhaps in their example game they guessed ""tags""? But then they decided to use ""RAISE"" as their real first guess? Or is it my first guess?\n\n Since my role is to guess words, I think I have to treat this as we are starting the game and I\'ve been asked for the first guess again? Maybe the user wants me to ignore the first round?\n\n Alternatively, the user might have intended to say: The first guess made (by either of us) was ""tags"", and now I need to make the second guess? But I never knew what feedback was given for ""tags"". So I cannot use that.\n\n Conclusion: I\'ll treat the request as asking for a first guess again because:\n\n - The user restates: ""Therefore, my first guess is \'RAISE\'"", suggesting that RAISE was the first guess.\n - The ""previous feedback"" with ""tags"" might be an error. \n\n Therefore, I will provide a new first guess? But the game already started? \n\n Given the confusion, I\'ll restart: My first guess (if this is indeed the first guess) could be ""RAISE"". But I already used it? \n\n Since the user says they are making their first guess as RAISE, then I, as the assistant, should make a new guess? \n\n Perhaps the user is playing one side and I am playing the other? \n\n This is too confusing. I\'ll default to repeating my first guess: RAISE.\n\n But note that the system prompt says: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"". So I must return a guess.\n\n However, without feedback from my previous guess (if any), I cannot advance.\n\n Alternatively, I\'ll assume that the user\'s feedback ""Guess 1: tags"" means that I made a guess of ""TAGS"" and that was not correct? But no feedback symbols? \n\n I think the best course of action is to treat this as the first guess again, since the user says ""first guess"" in their reasoning.\n\n But then why mention ""prior feedback""?\n\n Due to the confusion, I will make a new first guess, using a different word. Why not? Let\'s choose ""SLATE"", which is another optimized starting word.\n\n Why ""SLATE""? It includes common letters S, L, A, T, E. It\'s also very good.\n\n Or to avoid duplication, I can use ""CRANE"".\n\n But since the user said they are using ""RAISE"", I\'ll use a different one.\n\n Therefore, for this ""new"" first guess, I pick ""SLATE"".\n\n<guess>slate</guess>\n\n But note: the user might intended to provide feedback for my first guess, which was ""raise"". So I should wait for that feedback? \n\n Since the user\'s message doesn\'t contain feedback for ""raise"", I will assume we are resetting. \n\n If the user meant for me to make a second guess without feedback, that\'s impossible. \n\n Therefore, I choose to make a fresh start with a new first guess: ""SLATE"".\n\n<guess>raise</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: tags.\n\nSo, in my thought process, I\'ve reasoned it out.\n\nTherefore, my first guess is ""RAISE"".\n</think>\nFor the first guess in Wordle, I want a word that maximizes the information gained by including high-frequency letters: common vowels (A, E, I) and common consonants (R, S).

But then the feedback also says A(x), I(x), S(x), E(✓). \n\nBut note: the system\'s response after my first guess was: \n<guess>raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)\n\nThis means:\n- R is present in the word but not in the first position (because the symbol is ""-"" for wrong position).\n- A is not in the word (x).\n- I is not in the word (x).\n- S is not in the word (x).\n- E is in the word and in the correct position (fifth, since it\'s the last letter).\n\nSo the secret word has:\n- The letter E in the 5th position.\n- The letter R is present, but not in the 1st position.\n- The letters A, I, S are absent.\n\nTherefore, the secret word must have:\n- 5th letter: E\n- Contains R (but not at position 1)\n- Does not contain A, I, S.\n\nWe have 6 tries, and this is the second guess (since the first was ""raise"").\n\nNow, for the second guess, I need to choose a word that:\n- Includes the known correct letter E in the 5th position.\n- Includes the letter R (but not in the first position) and possibly other common letters that haven\'t been tested yet.\n- Avoids the letters A, I, S (since they are absent).\n\nCommon letters not yet tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nI should also consider that R must be in the word but not at position 1. So R can be in positions 2, 3, or 4.\n\nI want to test as many new common letters as possible. Common consonants: T, N, L, C, etc. Common vowels: O, U.\n\nA good candidate: ""TROVE""\n- T: new common consonant\n- R: we know it\'s present, and we can test it in position 2 (which is not position 1, so allowed)\n- O: new vowel\n- V: less common, but we need to test\n- E: in the correct 5th position.\n\nBut let me check if there are better options.\n\nAnother option: ""CRANE"" — but we know A is absent, so we cannot use A.

Also, we avoid A, I, S.\n\nAnother candidate: ""PROBE"" — but we don\'t know about P, B, and O. However, it has E at the end. But we are avoiding A, I, S. Also, R is in position 2.\n\nBut ""PROBE"" uses P, R, O, B, E. That\'s good.\n\nBut let\'s think about frequency. T, N, L are more common than P, B.\n\n""TROVE"" and ""DRONE"" are both good. I\'ll choose ""DRONE"" because it includes N, which is a very common letter.\n\nSo my second guess: ""DRONE""\n\nBut wait, we must ensure the word is valid. ""DRONE"" is a valid 5-letter word.\n\nFeedback expectations for ""DRONE"":\n- D: ? (could be absent, present, or correct)\n- R: if the secret word has R in position 2, then ✓; otherwise, if R is in 3 or 4, then - (because we know R is present but not in 1, so if not in 2, then it must be in 3 or 4, so we get a - for R in this guess if it\'s not in 2).\n- O: ?\n- N: ?\n- E: ✓ (we know it\'s correct)\n\nBut note: the goal is to get information. ""DRONE"" tests four new letters and the position of R.\n\nAlternatively, ""TROVE"" tests T, R, O, V, E.\n\nI think ""DRONE"" is slightly better because N is more common than V.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""DRONE"".\n\nBut note: the user\'s own first guess was ""RAISE"", and we have feedback for it. Then I am making the second guess.\n\nTherefore, the next guess is ""DRONE"".\n\nBut let me double-check: the feedback for ""RAISE"" was R(-), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(✓). So we know:\n- E is in position 5.\n- R is in the word, but not in position 1.\n- A, I, S are absent.\n\nSo ""DRONE"" is a valid guess.\n\nFinal decision: ""DRONE""Based on the feedback from your first guess ""RAISE"":\n- **R**: Present but wrong position (not 1st) → `-`\n- **A**: Absent → `x`\n- **I**: Absent → `x`\n- **S**: Absent → `x`\n- **E**: Correct position (5th) → `✓`\n\n### Key Insights:\n- The secret word has **E in the 5th position**.\n- **R is in the word**, but not in the 1st position (so it must be in position 2, 3, or 4).\n- **A, I, and S are absent** and can be excluded from future guesses.\n\n### Strategy for the Next Guess:\n- Prioritize words with **E in the 5th position** and **R in position 2, 3, or 4**.\n- Test new high-frequency letters (e.g., T, N, O, L, D) to maximize information.\n- Avoid A, I, S entirely.\n\n### Why ""DRONE""?\n- **D**: New common consonant (not yet tested).\n- **R**: Placed in position 2 to check if it\'s correct there (if not, it must be in 3 or 4).\n- **O**: New common vowel (not yet tested).\n- **N**: New common consonant (not yet tested).\n- **E**: Confirmed in the 5th position → `✓`.\n- It avoids A, I, S and covers 4 new letters (D, R, O, N), which could quickly reveal more about the secret word.\n\n<guess>raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)\n\nThis means:\n- R is present in the word but not in the first position (because the symbol is ""-"" for wrong position).\n- A is not in the word (x).\n- I is not in the word (x).\n- S is not in the word (x).\n- E is in the word and in the correct position (fifth, since it\'s the last letter).\n\nSo the secret word has:\n- The letter E in the 5th position.\n- The letter R is present, but not in the 1st position.\n- The letters A, I, S are absent.\n\nTherefore, the secret word must have:\n- 5th letter: E\n- Contains R (but not at position 1)\n- Does not contain A, I, S.\n\nWe have 6 tries, and this is the second guess (since the first was ""raise"").\n\nNow, for the second guess, I need to choose a word that:\n- Includes the known correct letter E in the 5th position.\n- Includes the letter R (but not in the first position) and possibly other common letters that haven\'t been tested yet.\n- Avoids the letters A, I, S (since they are absent).\n\nCommon letters not yet tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nI should also consider that R must be in the word but not at position 1.

We are given the following feedback history:
- Guess 1: ""RAISE"" → R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
- Guess 4: ""TROVE"" → T(x) R(✓) O(✓) V(x) E(✓)
- Guess 5: ""CRONE"" → C(x) R(✓) O(✓) N(✓) E(✓)

From this, we can deduce:

1. **E is in position 5** (confirmed by all guesses).
2. **R is in position 2** (confirmed by ""TROVE"" and ""CRONE"").
3. **O is in position 3** (confirmed by ""TROVE"" and ""CRONE"").
4. **N is in position 4** (confirmed by ""CRONE"" feedback: N(✓)).
5. **Absent letters**: A, I, S (from ""RAISE""), T, V (from ""TROVE""), and C (from ""CRONE"").

Therefore, the secret word must be: _ R O N E (with position 1 unknown).

We know position 1 must be a letter not yet excluded and not in the absent list. Excluded letters so far: A, C, I, S, T, V.

The only unknown is position 1. The secret word is ? R O N E.

Possible letters for position 1: Any uppercase letter except A, C, I, S, T, V (and not R, O, N, E, since those are already placed and we assume no duplicates unless indicated; feedback hasn't shown duplicates, so we assume unique letters).

Thus, position 1 can be: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, we need to find a valid English word of the form ? R O N E.

Common words:
- **DRONE**: D-R-O-N-E → But we haven't guessed it? Wait, in the history, we have ""CRONE"" and ""TROVE"", but not ""DRONE"". However, D is a possible letter.
- **PRONE**: P-R-O-N-E → Valid word (meaning likely to suffer or inclined).
- **FRONE**: Not a common word.
- **GRONE**: Not a word.
- **WRONE**: Not a word.
- **KRONE**: Valid (currency unit) → K-R-O-N-E.

But note: ""DRONE"" is also valid and common.

However, we have feedback from ""CRONE"" which showed N(✓) in position 4, so if we guess ""DRONE"", it would be D-R-O-N-E, which matches the pattern.

But we need to confirm position 1.

Since we have only one position unknown, we can guess a word that tests the remaining possibilities efficiently. But with one guess left (if we are on guess 6), we should aim to solve.

Given the pattern, the most common words are:
- DRONE
- PRONE
- KRONE (less common)

But note: ""BROWN"" is not matching (B-R-O-W-N, but we need E at the end).

So likely candidates: DRONE, PRONE.

We haven't tested D or P, so we can choose one.

But we can also consider the frequency: D is more common than P at the start of words.

However, to be safe, we can guess ""PRONE"" because:
- P is a common consonant not tested.
- If correct, we solve; if not, we know it must be another letter (like D, K, etc.), but we have limited guesses.

But we are on guess 6? The user said ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"", and we have had:
- Guess 1: RAISE
- Guess 4: TROVE (why skip 2 and 3? Maybe user provided only some feedback, but we have to work with what's given)
- Guess 5: CRONE

So next is guess 6.

We must guess a word that fits the pattern and uses an untested letter for position 1.

But we can also guess a word that includes multiple possibilities? Not possible with one letter.

So we pick the most likely: ""DRONE"" is a very common word.

But let's see the feedback from ""CRONE"": C(x) R(✓) O(✓) N(✓) E(✓). This means:
- C is absent (so position 1 is not C).
- R, O, N, E are correct in their positions.

So the word is ? R O N E.

Now, we guess ""DRONE"":
- D: if correct, then ✓; if not, then x or - but since position 1 is unknown, if D is present elsewhere, but we have no duplicates assumed, so if not in position 1, then absent? But the pattern requires position 1 to be filled.

Actually, if we guess ""DRONE"", and the secret word is ""PRONE"", then:
- D would be absent (x)
- R, O, N, E correct (✓)

But that would leave us knowing it's ""PRONE"" for the next guess? But we have only one guess left.

So to maximize the chance of solving, we should guess the most probable word.

In English, common words ending with ""RONE"" are:
- DRONE: frequency high
- PRONE: also high
- KRONE: lower

But without frequency data, we can choose ""PRONE"" because P is a common letter not tested.

Alternatively, we can choose ""DRONE"" for the same reason.

I think both are good, but I'll go with ""PRONE"" to test a new letter P.

But note: we haven't tested D either.

Since we have to choose, I'll pick ""PRONE"".

But let's see: the user's initial sequence had ""RAISE"", then ""TROVE"", then ""CRONE"". So we haven't used D or P.

So either is fine.

I'll choose ""PRONE"" as the guess.

Based on the cumulative feedback from all previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""RAISE""):** R(-), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(✓)  
  → R in word (wrong position), E in position 5, A/I/S absent.
- **Guess 4 (""TROVE""):** T(x), R(✓), O(✓), V(x), E(✓)  
  → R correct at position 2, O correct at position 3, E correct at position 5, T/V absent.
- **Guess 5 (""CRONE""):** C(x), R(✓), O(✓), N(✓), E(✓)  
  → R, O, N, E all correct in positions 2, 3, 4, 5; C absent.

### Key Insights:
- **Fixed positions:** 
  - Position 2: R
  - Position 3: O
  - Position 4: N
  - Position 5: E
- **Absent letters:** A, C, I, S, T, V (excluded from guesses).
- **Secret word pattern:** `_ R O N E` (only position 1 is unknown).
- **Remaining possibilities:** Position 1 must be a letter not excluded (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, W, Y, Z) and form a valid English word. Common options:
  - **DRONE** (D in position 1)
  - **PRONE** (P in position 1)
  - Less common: **KRONE** (K in position 1).

### Strategy for the Next Guess:
- We have **one unknown letter (position 1)**, so this guess should solve the word.
- ""PRONE"" is chosen because:
  - **P** is a high-frequency consonant not yet tested.
  - It fits the pattern `_ R O N E` and is a common English word (meaning ""likely to experience"" or ""lying face down"").
  - If correct, we solve the puzzle. If not, feedback on P will confirm the solution (e.g., if P is absent, the word must be ""DRONE"" or ""KRONE"").

### Expected Feedback:
- If the secret word is **PRONE**: P(✓), R(✓), O(✓), N(✓), E(✓) → Solved!  
- If not, feedback will show P(x) for position 1, narrowing it to **DRONE** (or rarer options like **KRONE**).

- Guess 5: ""CRONE"" → C(x) R(✓) O(✓) N(✓) E(✓)

From this, we can deduce:

1. **E is in position 5** (confirmed by all guesses).
2. **R is in position 2** (confirmed by ""TROVE"" and ""CRONE"").
3. **O is in position 3** (confirmed by ""TROVE"" and ""CRONE"").
4. **N is in position 4** (confirmed by ""CRONE"" feedback: N(✓)).
5. **Absent letters**: A, I, S (from ""RAISE""), T, V (from ""TROVE""), and C (from ""CRONE"").

Therefore, the secret word must be: _ R O N E (with position 1 unknown).

We know position 1 must be a letter not yet excluded and not in the absent list. Excluded letters so far: A, C, I, S, T, V.

- **FRONE**: Not a common word.
- **GRONE**: Not a word.

However, we have feedback from ""CRONE"" which showed N(✓) in position 4, so if we guess ""DRONE"", it would be D-R-O-N-E, which matches the pattern.

- Guess 5: CRONE

So next is guess 6.

We must guess a word that fits the pattern and uses an untested letter for position 1.

But we can also guess a word that includes multiple possibilities? Not possible with one letter.

So we pick the most likely: ""DRONE"" is a very common word.

But let's see the feedback from ""CRONE"": C(x) R(✓) O(✓) N(✓) E(✓). This means:
- C is absent (so position 1 is not C).
- R, O, N, E are correct in their positions.

So the word is ? R O N E.

Now, we guess ""DRONE"":
- D: if correct, then ✓; if not, then x or - but since position 1 is unknown, if D is present elsewhere, but we have no duplicates assumed, so if not in position 1, then absent? But the pattern requires position 1 to be filled.

Actually, if we guess ""DRONE"", and the secret word is ""PRONE"", then:
- D would be absent (x)
- R, O, N, E correct (✓)

But that would leave us knowing it's ""PRONE"" for the next guess? But we have only one guess left.

So to maximize the chance of solving, we should guess the most probable word.

In English, common words ending with ""RONE"" are:
- DRONE: frequency high
- PRONE: also high
- KRONE: lower

But without frequency data, we can choose ""PRONE"" because P is a common letter not tested.

Alternatively, we can choose ""DRONE"" for the same reason.

I think both are good, but I'll go with ""PRONE"" to test a new letter P.

But note: we haven't tested D either.

Since we have to choose, I'll pick ""PRONE"".

But let's see: the user's initial sequence had ""RAISE"", then ""TROVE"", then ""CRONE"". So we haven't used D or P.

So either is fine.

I'll choose ""PRONE"" as the guess.

<guess>prone</guess>Based on the cumulative feedback from all previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""RAISE""):** R(-), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(✓)  
  → R in word (wrong position), E in position 5, A/I/S absent.
- **Guess 4 (""TROVE""):** T(x), R(✓), O(✓), V(x), E(✓)  
  → R correct at position 2, O correct at position 3, E correct at position 5, T/V absent.
- **Guess 5 (""CRONE""):** C(x), R(✓), O(✓), N(✓), E(✓)  
  → R, O, N, E all correct in positions 2, 3, 4, 5; C absent.

### Key Insights:
- **Fixed positions:** 
  - Position 2: R
  - Position 3: O
  - Position 4: N
  - Position 5: E
- **Absent letters:** A, C, I, S, T, V (excluded from guesses).
- **Secret word pattern:** `_ R O N E` (only position 1 is unknown).
- **Remaining possibilities:** Position 1 must be a letter not excluded (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, W, Y, Z) and form a valid English word. Common options:
  - **DRONE** (D in position 1)
  - **PRONE** (P in position 1)
  - Less common: **KRONE** (K in position 1).

### Strategy for the Next Guess:
- We have **one unknown letter (position 1)**, so this guess should solve the word.
- ""PRONE"" is chosen because:
  - **P** is a high-frequency consonant not yet tested.
  - It fits the pattern `_ R O N E` and is a common English word (meaning ""likely to experience"" or ""lying face down"").
  - If correct, we solve the puzzle. If not, feedback on P will confirm the solution (e.g., if P is absent, the word must be ""DRONE"" or ""KRONE"").

### Expected Feedback:
- If the secret word is **PRONE**: P(✓), R(✓), O(✓), N(✓), E(✓) → Solved!  
- If not, feedback will show P(x) for position 1, narrowing it to **DRONE** (or rarer options like **KRONE**).",Guess 6: prone -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) R(✓) O(✓) N(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
