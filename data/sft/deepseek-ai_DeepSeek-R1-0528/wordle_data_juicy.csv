First, I need to make my first guess for a 5-letter word. Since I have no prior information, I should choose a word that maximizes the information I can gain about the secret word. The best strategy is to use a word with common letters that cover multiple possibilities.

I recall that in games like Wordle, a good starting word often uses common vowels and consonants to cover a broad range of letters. This helps in narrowing down the possibilities based on the feedback.

Common vowels in English are A, E, I, O, U. Common consonants include S, T, N, R, H, L, D, etc.

A popular starting word is ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" because they include frequent letters. Another one is ""ADIEU"", which has many vowels, but since there are only five positions, I need a balance of vowels and consonants.

I should aim for a word with at least two vowels and three consonants to get a good spread.

Let me think of some options:

- ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E – includes common letters S, T, E, A.

- ""CRANE"": C, R, A, N, E – similar, with R, A, N, E.

- ""ROATE"": R, O, A, T, E – which is a less common word but has good coverage.

I need to ensure the word is valid. ""ROATE"" might not be universally recognized; it's better to choose a common word.

""ARISE"" is another good one: A, R, I, S, E – covers vowels A, I, E and consonants R, S.

Or ""IRATE"": I, R, A, T, E.

From feedback perspective, having distinct letters is important so that I can get clear information. If there are repeating letters, it might complicate the feedback, especially for the first guess. So, I should avoid words with duplicate letters.

For example, ""BOOKS"" has repeated O and S, so not ideal. Or ""SPOON"" with double O.

Therefore, I'll avoid repeats.

Suggested words without repeats: ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ADIEU"" (but A and E are vowels, D and U, U is less common), ""STERN"", ""PAINT"", etc.

""ADIEU"" might be good for vowels, but consonants are D, which is medium frequency.

In terms of letter frequency in English words, here's a rough order: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, etc.

So, a word like ""STARE"" – S, T, A, R, E – covers S, T, A, R, E, all high frequency letters.

Similarly, ""CARES"" or ""SLANT"".

""RESIN"": R, E, S, I, N – has R, E, S, I, N.

I think ""STARE"" is a solid choice.

But let's confirm if it's valid. Yes, ""stare"" is a common English word.

""RAISE"" is similar: R, A, I, S, E.

Either is fine.

I'll go with ""RAISE"" for my first guess because it has R, A, I, S, E – four vowels? A, I, E are vowels, R and S are consonants. Vowels: A, I, E; consonants: R, S.

In five letters: positions: 1-R, 2-A, 3-I, 4-S, 5-E.

Yes.

I could use ""CRATE"" or ""SLATE"", but ""RAISE"" seems good.

Another popular one is ""OUIJA"" but that's not as common and has U, which might not be optimal.

I think ""RAISE"" or ""SLATE"" are standard.

Let me choose ""RAISE"" for now.

But the goal is to maximize entropy, meaning that after the guess, the feedback should help reduce the possible word set as much as possible.

Based on studies, words like ""SOARE"" or ""ROATE"" are often recommended, but they are obscure. Better to stick with common words.

""ARISE"" is essentially the same as ""RAISE"", just different starting letter.

I'll use ""ARISE"": A, R, I, S, E.

Same letters.

Perhaps ""STEAM"": S, T, E, A, M – includes M, which is medium frequency.

But ""ARISE"" has higher frequency letters.

E is the most common, then A, R, I, S are all top 10 or so.

Letter frequencies: E is about 12%, T 9%, A 8%, O 7.5%, I 7%, N 7%, S 6.5%, H 6%, R 6%, D 4%, L 4%, etc.

""ARISE"" has A, R, I, S, E – A:8%, R:6%, I:7%, S:6.5%, E:12%. Good coverage.

""SLATE"" has S:6.5%, L:4%, A:8%, T:9%, E:12% – similar, with T instead of I, and L vs R.

T is more common than R or I? T 9% vs R 6%, I 7%, so T is higher.

""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E – L is less common at 4%, while R is 6%. So ""CRATE"" might be better: C: 3%, R:6%, A:8%, T:9%, E:12% – C is lower frequency.

How about ""TRACE"": T, R, A, C, E – again, C is low.

""STARE"": S, T, A, R, E – S:6.5%, T:9%, A:8%, R:6%, E:12%. All solid.

I think ""STARE"" is slightly better because of higher T frequency.

Similarly, ""CRANE"" has N instead of T; N is 7%.

But T is 9%, so ""STARE"" or ""SLATE"".

""SLATE"" has L at 4%, while ""STARE"" has R at 6%, so ""STARE"" has a slightly better average frequency.

I can go with ""STARE"".

But ""RAISE"" has I at 7% vs L in ""SLATE"" at 4%, so ""RAISE"" might be comparable.

No real difference; I'll pick one.

For consistency, I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it's often used, but let's decide.

Since I need to output the guess, I'll go with ""ARISE"".

But in the system prompt, it used ""STORM"" as an example, so any valid word is fine.

I think ""ARISE"" is good.

Let me make a choice.

I'll use ""SALET"" which is a word, but not common; ""salet"" is historical, may not be known. Better avoid.

""ALERT"" is good: A, L, E, R, T.

But I think ""ARISE"" is fine.

To save time, I'll go with ""RAISE"".

Final decision: ""RAISE""

So for the response, I need to think step by step, then output the guess.

Thought process: As this is the first guess with no prior information, I should select a word that contains common letters to maximize the likelihood of getting feedback on frequent vowels and consonants. This helps in narrowing down the possible word list for subsequent guesses. After considering options like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", and ""STARE"", I choose ""RAISE"" as it includes high-frequency letters such as R, A, I, S, and E without any repeats.

Then output in the format.

Or ""SPOON"" with double O.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll avoid repeats.\n\nSuggested words without repeats: ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ADIEU"" (but A and E are vowels, D and U, U is less common), ""STERN"", ""PAINT"", etc.\n\n""ADIEU"" might be good for vowels, but consonants are D, which is medium frequency.\n\nIn terms of letter frequency in English words, here\'s a rough order: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, etc.\n\nSo, a word like ""STARE"" – S, T, A, R, E – covers S, T, A, R, E, all high frequency letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""CARES"" or ""SLANT"".\n\n""RESIN"": R, E, S, I, N – has R, E, S, I, N.\n\nI think ""STARE"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut let\'s confirm if it\'s valid. Yes, ""stare"" is a common English word.\n\n""RAISE"" is similar: R, A, I, S, E.\n\nEither is fine.\n\nI\'ll go with ""RAISE"" for my first guess because it has R, A, I, S, E – four vowels? A, I, E are vowels, R and S are consonants. Vowels: A, I, E; consonants: R, S.\n\nIn five letters: positions: 1-R, 2-A, 3-I, 4-S, 5-E.\n\nYes.\n\nI could use ""CRATE"" or ""SLATE"", but ""RAISE"" seems good.\n\nAnother popular one is ""OUIJA"" but that\'s not as common and has U, which might not be optimal.\n\nI think ""RAISE"" or ""SLATE"" are standard.\n\nLet me choose ""RAISE"" for now.\n\nBut the goal is to maximize entropy, meaning that after the guess, the feedback should help reduce the possible word set as much as possible.\n\nBased on studies, words like ""SOARE"" or ""ROATE"" are often recommended, but they are obscure. Better to stick with common words.\n\n""ARISE"" is essentially the same as ""RAISE"", just different starting letter.\n\nI\'ll use ""ARISE"": A, R, I, S, E.\n\nSame letters.\n\nPerhaps ""STEAM"": S, T, E, A, M – includes M, which is medium frequency.\n\nBut ""ARISE"" has higher frequency letters.\n\nE is the most common, then A, R, I, S are all top 10 or so.\n\nLetter frequencies: E is about 12%, T 9%, A 8%, O 7.5%, I 7%, N 7%, S 6.5%, H 6%, R 6%, D 4%, L 4%, etc.\n\n""ARISE"" has A, R, I, S, E – A:8%, R:6%, I:7%, S:6.5%, E:12%. Good coverage.\n\n""SLATE"" has S:6.5%, L:4%, A:8%, T:9%, E:12% – similar, with T instead of I, and L vs R.\n\nT is more common than R or I? T 9% vs R 6%, I 7%, so T is higher.\n\n""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E – L is less common at 4%, while R is 6%. So ""CRATE"" might be better: C: 3%, R:6%, A:8%, T:9%, E:12% – C is lower frequency.\n\nHow about ""TRACE"": T, R, A, C, E – again, C is low.\n\n""STARE"": S, T, A, R, E – S:6.5%, T:9%, A:8%, R:6%, E:12%. All solid.\n\nI think ""STARE"" is slightly better because of higher T frequency.\n\nSimilarly, ""CRANE"" has N instead of T; N is 7%.\n\nBut T is 9%, so ""STARE"" or ""SLATE"".\n\n""SLATE"" has L at 4%, while ""STARE"" has R at 6%, so ""STARE"" has a slightly better average frequency.\n\nI can go with ""STARE"".\n\nBut ""RAISE"" has I at 7% vs L in ""SLATE"" at 4%, so ""RAISE"" might be comparable.\n\nNo real difference; I\'ll pick one.\n\nFor consistency, I\'ll choose ""CRANE"" as it\'s often used, but let\'s decide.\n\nSince I need to output the guess, I\'ll go with ""ARISE"".\n\nBut in the system prompt, it used ""STORM"" as an example, so any valid word is fine.\n\nI think ""ARISE"" is good.\n\nLet me make a choice.\n\nI\'ll use ""SALET"" which is a word, but not common; ""salet"" is historical, may not be known. Better avoid.\n\n""ALERT"" is good: A, L, E, R, T.\n\nBut I think ""ARISE"" is fine.\n\nTo save time, I\'ll go with ""RAISE"".\n\nFinal decision: ""RAISE""\n\nSo for the response, I need to think step by step, then output the guess.\n\nThought process: As this is the first guess with no prior information, I should select a word that contains common letters to maximize the likelihood of getting feedback on frequent vowels and consonants. This helps in narrowing down the possible word list for subsequent guesses. After considering options like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", and ""STARE"", I choose ""RAISE"" as it includes high-frequency letters such as R, A, I, S, and E without any repeats.\n\nThen output in the format.Since this is the first guess, there is no prior feedback to consider. The goal is to choose a starting word that maximizes information gain by including high-frequency letters (vowels and consonants) to narrow down possibilities quickly. After evaluating common options:\n- Vowels like A, E, I are frequent and help identify core word structure.\n- Consonants like R, S are also common and versatile.\nWords like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""STARE"" are often effective, but ""RAISE"" was selected for its balance:\n  - It contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two consonants (R, S), with all letters distinct to avoid ambiguity.\n  - Letter frequencies: R (approx. 6%), A (8%), I (7%), S (6.5%), E (12%) cover a broad range of common English letters.\nThis choice increases the chance of getting useful position or presence feedback to inform later guesses.\n\n<guess>RAISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(✓) S(x) E(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- I: ✓ (correct position, so the third letter is I)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, from this, we know:
- The third letter is I.
- The letters R, A, S, E are not in the word at all.
- Therefore, the secret word has I as the third letter, and does not contain R, A, S, E.

Now, we need to make a second guess. The guess must be a 5-letter word with I in the third position, and it should avoid using R, A, S, E.

We also want to use this guess to test other common letters to gather more information.

Since I is fixed at position 3, we have to form a word with the pattern _ _ I _ _

We should choose letters that are common and not yet tested. From the first guess, we have eliminated R, A, S, E. So we have to avoid these.

Common letters left: T, O, N, H, L, D, C, U, M, P, etc.

We should aim to include as many new, common letters as possible in the guess.

Possible words that fit the pattern _ _ I _ _ and don't use R, A, S, E:

Let's think of some words:
- With T: e.g., ""POINT"" (P, O, I, N, T) — but we have to check if it avoids R,A,S,E. P, O, I, N, T — yes, none of R,A,S,E.
- ""BUILT"" (B, U, I, L, T) — avoids R,A,S,E.
- ""GUILD"" (G, U, I, L, D) — avoids R,A,S,E.
- ""CHILL"" (C, H, I, L, L) — but has double L, which might not be ideal because it reduces the number of distinct letters. Better to avoid repeats if possible to get more information.
- ""THING"" (T, H, I, N, G) — avoids R,A,S,E.

We want to maximize the number of new letters tested.

Letters we haven't used: from the first guess we used R,A,I,S,E. So we have I already known, but we are testing other positions.

In the second guess, we can test T, O, N, H, L, D, C, U, M, P, etc.

Let's list the frequency: T (9%), O (7.5%), N (7%), H (6%), L (4%), D (4%), C (3%), U (2.5%), M (2.5%), P (2%), etc.

So, high frequency: T, O, N, H.

We should try to include T, O, N, H if possible.

Word with I in the middle and including T, O, N, H.

For example:
- ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T — includes O, N, T (and P). P is less common, but O, N, T are good.
- ""THINK"": T, H, I, N, K — includes T, H, N, K. K is less common, but T, H, N are good.
- ""LIGHT"": L, I, G, H, T — but I is at position 2, not 3. We need I at position 3.
- ""NIGHT"": N, I, G, H, T — I is at position 2? N-I-G-H-T, so positions: 1-N, 2-I, 3-G, 4-H, 5-T. But we need I at position 3, so that's not it.

We need the third letter to be I, so pattern: ? ? I ? ?

So for ""NIGHT"", it's N-I-G-H-T, so I is at position 2, not 3.

Similarly, ""POINT"": P-O-I-N-T, so positions: 1-P, 2-O, 3-I, 4-N, 5-T. Perfect.

""BUILT"": B-U-I-L-T, so 1-B, 2-U, 3-I, 4-L, 5-T.

""GUILD"": G-U-I-L-D, 1-G, 2-U, 3-I, 4-L, 5-D.

""CHILL"": C-H-I-L-L, 1-C, 2-H, 3-I, 4-L, 5-L — but double L, so not ideal.

""THING"": T-H-I-N-G, 1-T, 2-H, 3-I, 4-N, 5-G.

""DOING"": D-O-I-N-G, 1-D, 2-O, 3-I, 4-N, 5-G.

""GOING"": G-O-I-N-G, but has double G? G-O-I-N-G, so 1-G, 2-O, 3-I, 4-N, 5-G — G is repeated, so not good for information.

""JOINT"": J-O-I-N-T — J is rare.

""MOIST"": M-O-I-S-T — but S is eliminated, we cannot use S because S is not in the word (from feedback, S is x, meaning not in word). So we must avoid S.

Similarly, we must avoid R, A, E as well.

So ""MOIST"" has S, which is invalid.

Similarly, ""POINT"" is good: P-O-I-N-T, no R,A,S,E.

""BUILT"": B-U-I-L-T, no R,A,S,E.

""THING"": T-H-I-N-G, no R,A,S,E.

""DOING"": D-O-I-N-G, no R,A,S,E.

""FLING"": F-L-I-N-G, no R,A,S,E.

""CLING"": C-L-I-N-G, etc.

Now, among these, which one has the most common letters? ""POINT"" has O, N, T which are high frequency. P is less common, but it's acceptable.

""THING"" has T, H, N, G — H and N are good, G is medium.

""DOING"" has O, N, G — O and N are high.

But ""POINT"" has O, N, T — T is the most common consonant.

We also want to cover different letters to test more.

Since we know I is in the word and at position 3, we don't need to test I again, but we can use it to form the word.

In the feedback, for the second guess, we will get information about the other positions.

I think ""POINT"" is a good choice: it tests P, O, N, T in positions 1,2,4,5, and we know position 3 is I.

Similarly, ""THING"" tests T, H, N, G.

But ""POINT"" might be better because O and T are very common.

Another word: ""JOINT"" but J is rare.

""MOUNT"": M-O-U-N-T — but U is less common, and we have I at position 3? M-O-U-N-T has U at position 3, not I. We need I at position 3.

""POINT"" seems solid.

""BUILT"" has U, which is less common, but it's okay.

I think ""POINT"" is a standard word.

We could use ""BLIND"": B-L-I-N-D — but L and D are medium, and we avoid R,A,S,E.

But ""POINT"" has higher frequency letters.

Let's compare the frequency sum for the new letters:

For ""POINT"": P (2%), O (7.5%), N (7%), T (9%) — but we are testing positions 1,2,4,5. Position 3 is I, which we already know, so we don't get new info about I, but we use it to form the word.

The feedback will tell us about P, O, N, T.

Similarly for ""THING"": T (9%), H (6%), N (7%), G (2%) — T and N are high, H medium, G low.

""POINT"" has O and T high, N high, P low.

O is 7.5%, T 9%, N 7%, P 2% — average better than ""THING"" which has G at 2%.

""DOING"": D (4%), O (7.5%), N (7%), G (2%) — D and G lower.

So ""POINT"" seems best.

Another word: ""PRINT"" — but P-R-I-N-T, R is eliminated, we cannot use R. R is not in the word, so avoid.

Similarly, ""TRAIN"" has R and A, both eliminated.

So ""POINT"" is good.

""JOINT"" has J, which is very rare.

""QUINT"" has Q and U, Q is rare.

So I think ""POINT"" is a reasonable choice.

Therefore, I'll go with ""POINT"" for the second guess.

Thought process: Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"", we know that the third letter is 'I' and that 'R', 'A', 'S', 'E' are not in the word. Therefore, the second guess must have 'I' in the third position and avoid using the letters R, A, S, E. The goal is to test new common letters to gather more information. After considering words like ""THING"", ""BUILT"", and ""DOING"", ""POINT"" was selected because it includes high-frequency letters O, N, T (and P) in distinct positions, maximizing the potential for useful feedback on letter presence and position.

</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- The third letter is ""I"" and in the correct position (✓).
- The letters ""R"", ""A"", ""S"", and ""E"" are not in the word at all (x).

For the second guess:
- The word must have ""I"" as the third letter (position 3).
- It must avoid using the letters R, A, S, or E.
- To maximize information gain, I should prioritize common unused letters (e.g., T, O, N, L, C, H) and avoid repeating letters to test more possibilities.

After evaluating options:
- ""POINT"" fits the criteria: it has ""I"" in position 3, avoids R/A/S/E, and tests new high-frequency letters (T, O, N) and the less common P. This provides broad coverage to narrow down the word list effectively.

<guess>POINT</guess>",POINT,"We have feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- I: ✓ (correct position, so the third letter is I)

- E: x (not in the word)

So, from this, we know:
- The third letter is I.
- The letters R, A, S, E are not in the word at all.
- Therefore, the secret word has I as the third letter, and does not contain R, A, S, E.

Now, we need to make a second guess. The guess must be a 5-letter word with I in the third position, and it should avoid using R, A, S, E.

We also want to use this guess to test other common letters to gather more information.

Since I is fixed at position 3, we have to form a word with the pattern _ _ I _ _

We should choose letters that are common and not yet tested. From the first guess, we have eliminated R, A, S, E. So we have to avoid these.

Common letters left: T, O, N, H, L, D, C, U, M, P, etc.

We should aim to include as many new, common letters as possible in the guess.

Possible words that fit the pattern _ _ I _ _ and don't use R, A, S, E:

- ""CHILL"" (C, H, I, L, L) — but has double L, which might not be ideal because it reduces the number of distinct letters. Better to avoid repeats if possible to get more information.
- ""THING"" (T, H, I, N, G) — avoids R,A,S,E.

We want to maximize the number of new letters tested.

Letters we haven't used: from the first guess we used R,A,I,S,E. So we have I already known, but we are testing other positions.

In the second guess, we can test T, O, N, H, L, D, C, U, M, P, etc.

Let's list the frequency: T (9%), O (7.5%), N (7%), H (6%), L (4%), D (4%), C (3%), U (2.5%), M (2.5%), P (2%), etc.

So, high frequency: T, O, N, H.

We should try to include T, O, N, H if possible.

For example:

We need the third letter to be I, so pattern: ? ? I ? ?

So for ""NIGHT"", it's N-I-G-H-T, so I is at position 2, not 3.

Similarly, ""POINT"": P-O-I-N-T, so positions: 1-P, 2-O, 3-I, 4-N, 5-T. Perfect.

""BUILT"": B-U-I-L-T, so 1-B, 2-U, 3-I, 4-L, 5-T.

""GUILD"": G-U-I-L-D, 1-G, 2-U, 3-I, 4-L, 5-D.

""DOING"": D-O-I-N-G, 1-D, 2-O, 3-I, 4-N, 5-G.

""GOING"": G-O-I-N-G, but has double G? G-O-I-N-G, so 1-G, 2-O, 3-I, 4-N, 5-G — G is repeated, so not good for information.

""MOIST"": M-O-I-S-T — but S is eliminated, we cannot use S because S is not in the word (from feedback, S is x, meaning not in word). So we must avoid S.

""FLING"": F-L-I-N-G, no R,A,S,E.

""CLING"": C-L-I-N-G, etc.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>First, I need to make my first guess for a 5-letter word. Since I have no prior information, I should choose a word that maximizes the information I can gain about the secret word. The best strategy is to use a word with common letters that cover multiple possibilities.

I recall that in games like Wordle, a good starting word often uses common vowels and consonants to cover a broad range of letters. This helps in narrowing down the possibilities based on the feedback.

Common vowels in English are A, E, I, O, U. Common consonants include S, T, N, R, H, L, D, etc.

A popular starting word is ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" because they include frequent letters. Another one is ""ADIEU"", which has many vowels, but since there are only five positions, I need a balance of vowels and consonants.

I should aim for a word with at least two vowels and three consonants to get a good spread.

Let me think of some options:

- ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E – includes common letters S, T, E, A.

- ""CRANE"": C, R, A, N, E – similar, with R, A, N, E.

- ""ROATE"": R, O, A, T, E – which is a less common word but has good coverage.

I need to ensure the word is valid. ""ROATE"" might not be universally recognized; it's better to choose a common word.

""ARISE"" is another good one: A, R, I, S, E – covers vowels A, I, E and consonants R, S.

Or ""IRATE"": I, R, A, T, E.

From feedback perspective, having distinct letters is important so that I can get clear information. If there are repeating letters, it might complicate the feedback, especially for the first guess. So, I should avoid words with duplicate letters.

For example, ""BOOKS"" has repeated O and S, so not ideal. Or ""SPOON"" with double O.

Therefore, I'll avoid repeats.

Suggested words without repeats: ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ADIEU"" (but A and E are vowels, D and U, U is less common), ""STERN"", ""PAINT"", etc.

""ADIEU"" might be good for vowels, but consonants are D, which is medium frequency.

In terms of letter frequency in English words, here's a rough order: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, etc.

So, a word like ""STARE"" – S, T, A, R, E – covers S, T, A, R, E, all high frequency letters.

Similarly, ""CARES"" or ""SLANT"".

""RESIN"": R, E, S, I, N – has R, E, S, I, N.

I think ""STARE"" is a solid choice.

But let's confirm if it's valid. Yes, ""stare"" is a common English word.

""RAISE"" is similar: R, A, I, S, E.

Either is fine.

I'll go with ""RAISE"" for my first guess because it has R, A, I, S, E – four vowels? A, I, E are vowels, R and S are consonants. Vowels: A, I, E; consonants: R, S.

In five letters: positions: 1-R, 2-A, 3-I, 4-S, 5-E.

Yes.

I could use ""CRATE"" or ""SLATE"", but ""RAISE"" seems good.

Another popular one is ""OUIJA"" but that's not as common and has U, which might not be optimal.

I think ""RAISE"" or ""SLATE"" are standard.

Let me choose ""RAISE"" for now.

But the goal is to maximize entropy, meaning that after the guess, the feedback should help reduce the possible word set as much as possible.

Based on studies, words like ""SOARE"" or ""ROATE"" are often recommended, but they are obscure. Better to stick with common words.

""ARISE"" is essentially the same as ""RAISE"", just different starting letter.

I'll use ""ARISE"": A, R, I, S, E.

Same letters.

Perhaps ""STEAM"": S, T, E, A, M – includes M, which is medium frequency.

But ""ARISE"" has higher frequency letters.

E is the most common, then A, R, I, S are all top 10 or so.

Letter frequencies: E is about 12%, T 9%, A 8%, O 7.5%, I 7%, N 7%, S 6.5%, H 6%, R 6%, D 4%, L 4%, etc.

""ARISE"" has A, R, I, S, E – A:8%, R:6%, I:7%, S:6.5%, E:12%. Good coverage.

""SLATE"" has S:6.5%, L:4%, A:8%, T:9%, E:12% – similar, with T instead of I, and L vs R.

T is more common than R or I? T 9% vs R 6%, I 7%, so T is higher.

""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E – L is less common at 4%, while R is 6%. So ""CRATE"" might be better: C: 3%, R:6%, A:8%, T:9%, E:12% – C is lower frequency.

How about ""TRACE"": T, R, A, C, E – again, C is low.

""STARE"": S, T, A, R, E – S:6.5%, T:9%, A:8%, R:6%, E:12%. All solid.

I think ""STARE"" is slightly better because of higher T frequency.

Similarly, ""CRANE"" has N instead of T; N is 7%.

But T is 9%, so ""STARE"" or ""SLATE"".

""SLATE"" has L at 4%, while ""STARE"" has R at 6%, so ""STARE"" has a slightly better average frequency.

I can go with ""STARE"".

But ""RAISE"" has I at 7% vs L in ""SLATE"" at 4%, so ""RAISE"" might be comparable.

No real difference; I'll pick one.

For consistency, I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it's often used, but let's decide.

Since I need to output the guess, I'll go with ""ARISE"".

But in the system prompt, it used ""STORM"" as an example, so any valid word is fine.

I think ""ARISE"" is good.

Let me make a choice.

I'll use ""SALET"" which is a word, but not common; ""salet"" is historical, may not be known. Better avoid.

""ALERT"" is good: A, L, E, R, T.

But I think ""ARISE"" is fine.

To save time, I'll go with ""RAISE"".

Final decision: ""RAISE""

So for the response, I need to think step by step, then output the guess.

Thought process: As this is the first guess with no prior information, I should select a word that contains common letters to maximize the likelihood of getting feedback on frequent vowels and consonants. This helps in narrowing down the possible word list for subsequent guesses. After considering options like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", and ""STARE"", I choose ""RAISE"" as it includes high-frequency letters such as R, A, I, S, and E without any repeats.

Then output in the format.Since this is the first guess, there is no prior feedback to consider. The goal is to choose a starting word that maximizes information gain by including high-frequency letters (vowels and consonants) to narrow down possibilities quickly. After evaluating common options:
- Vowels like A, E, I are frequent and help identify core word structure.
- Consonants like R, S are also common and versatile.
Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""STARE"" are often effective, but ""RAISE"" was selected for its balance:
  - It contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two consonants (R, S), with all letters distinct to avoid ambiguity.
  - Letter frequencies: R (approx. 6%), A (8%), I (7%), S (6.5%), E (12%) cover a broad range of common English letters.
This choice increases the chance of getting useful position or presence feedback to inform later guesses.

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(✓) S(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- I: ✓ (correct position, so the third letter is I)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, from this, we know:
- The third letter is I.
- The letters R, A, S, E are not in the word at all.
- Therefore, the secret word has I as the third letter, and does not contain R, A, S, E.

Now, we need to make a second guess. The guess must be a 5-letter word with I in the third position, and it should avoid using R, A, S, E.

We also want to use this guess to test other common letters to gather more information.

Since I is fixed at position 3, we have to form a word with the pattern _ _ I _ _

We should choose letters that are common and not yet tested. From the first guess, we have eliminated R, A, S, E. So we have to avoid these.

Common letters left: T, O, N, H, L, D, C, U, M, P, etc.

We should aim to include as many new, common letters as possible in the guess.

Possible words that fit the pattern _ _ I _ _ and don't use R, A, S, E:

Let's think of some words:
- With T: e.g., ""POINT"" (P, O, I, N, T) — but we have to check if it avoids R,A,S,E. P, O, I, N, T — yes, none of R,A,S,E.
- ""BUILT"" (B, U, I, L, T) — avoids R,A,S,E.
- ""GUILD"" (G, U, I, L, D) — avoids R,A,S,E.
- ""CHILL"" (C, H, I, L, L) — but has double L, which might not be ideal because it reduces the number of distinct letters. Better to avoid repeats if possible to get more information.
- ""THING"" (T, H, I, N, G) — avoids R,A,S,E.

We want to maximize the number of new letters tested.

Letters we haven't used: from the first guess we used R,A,I,S,E. So we have I already known, but we are testing other positions.

In the second guess, we can test T, O, N, H, L, D, C, U, M, P, etc.

Let's list the frequency: T (9%), O (7.5%), N (7%), H (6%), L (4%), D (4%), C (3%), U (2.5%), M (2.5%), P (2%), etc.

So, high frequency: T, O, N, H.

We should try to include T, O, N, H if possible.

Word with I in the middle and including T, O, N, H.

For example:
- ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T — includes O, N, T (and P). P is less common, but O, N, T are good.
- ""THINK"": T, H, I, N, K — includes T, H, N, K. K is less common, but T, H, N are good.
- ""LIGHT"": L, I, G, H, T — but I is at position 2, not 3. We need I at position 3.
- ""NIGHT"": N, I, G, H, T — I is at position 2? N-I-G-H-T, so positions: 1-N, 2-I, 3-G, 4-H, 5-T. But we need I at position 3, so that's not it.

We need the third letter to be I, so pattern: ? ? I ? ?

So for ""NIGHT"", it's N-I-G-H-T, so I is at position 2, not 3.

Similarly, ""POINT"": P-O-I-N-T, so positions: 1-P, 2-O, 3-I, 4-N, 5-T. Perfect.

""BUILT"": B-U-I-L-T, so 1-B, 2-U, 3-I, 4-L, 5-T.

""GUILD"": G-U-I-L-D, 1-G, 2-U, 3-I, 4-L, 5-D.

""CHILL"": C-H-I-L-L, 1-C, 2-H, 3-I, 4-L, 5-L — but double L, so not ideal.

""THING"": T-H-I-N-G, 1-T, 2-H, 3-I, 4-N, 5-G.

""DOING"": D-O-I-N-G, 1-D, 2-O, 3-I, 4-N, 5-G.

""GOING"": G-O-I-N-G, but has double G? G-O-I-N-G, so 1-G, 2-O, 3-I, 4-N, 5-G — G is repeated, so not good for information.

""JOINT"": J-O-I-N-T — J is rare.

""MOIST"": M-O-I-S-T — but S is eliminated, we cannot use S because S is not in the word (from feedback, S is x, meaning not in word). So we must avoid S.

Similarly, we must avoid R, A, E as well.

So ""MOIST"" has S, which is invalid.

Similarly, ""POINT"" is good: P-O-I-N-T, no R,A,S,E.

""BUILT"": B-U-I-L-T, no R,A,S,E.

""THING"": T-H-I-N-G, no R,A,S,E.

""DOING"": D-O-I-N-G, no R,A,S,E.

""FLING"": F-L-I-N-G, no R,A,S,E.

""CLING"": C-L-I-N-G, etc.

Now, among these, which one has the most common letters? ""POINT"" has O, N, T which are high frequency. P is less common, but it's acceptable.

""THING"" has T, H, N, G — H and N are good, G is medium.

""DOING"" has O, N, G — O and N are high.

But ""POINT"" has O, N, T — T is the most common consonant.

We also want to cover different letters to test more.

Since we know I is in the word and at position 3, we don't need to test I again, but we can use it to form the word.

In the feedback, for the second guess, we will get information about the other positions.

I think ""POINT"" is a good choice: it tests P, O, N, T in positions 1,2,4,5, and we know position 3 is I.

Similarly, ""THING"" tests T, H, N, G.

But ""POINT"" might be better because O and T are very common.

Another word: ""JOINT"" but J is rare.

""MOUNT"": M-O-U-N-T — but U is less common, and we have I at position 3? M-O-U-N-T has U at position 3, not I. We need I at position 3.

""POINT"" seems solid.

""BUILT"" has U, which is less common, but it's okay.

I think ""POINT"" is a standard word.

We could use ""BLIND"": B-L-I-N-D — but L and D are medium, and we avoid R,A,S,E.

But ""POINT"" has higher frequency letters.

Let's compare the frequency sum for the new letters:

For ""POINT"": P (2%), O (7.5%), N (7%), T (9%) — but we are testing positions 1,2,4,5. Position 3 is I, which we already know, so we don't get new info about I, but we use it to form the word.

The feedback will tell us about P, O, N, T.

Similarly for ""THING"": T (9%), H (6%), N (7%), G (2%) — T and N are high, H medium, G low.

""POINT"" has O and T high, N high, P low.

O is 7.5%, T 9%, N 7%, P 2% — average better than ""THING"" which has G at 2%.

""DOING"": D (4%), O (7.5%), N (7%), G (2%) — D and G lower.

So ""POINT"" seems best.

Another word: ""PRINT"" — but P-R-I-N-T, R is eliminated, we cannot use R. R is not in the word, so avoid.

Similarly, ""TRAIN"" has R and A, both eliminated.

So ""POINT"" is good.

""JOINT"" has J, which is very rare.

""QUINT"" has Q and U, Q is rare.

So I think ""POINT"" is a reasonable choice.

Therefore, I'll go with ""POINT"" for the second guess.

Thought process: Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"", we know that the third letter is 'I' and that 'R', 'A', 'S', 'E' are not in the word. Therefore, the second guess must have 'I' in the third position and avoid using the letters R, A, S, E. The goal is to test new common letters to gather more information. After considering words like ""THING"", ""BUILT"", and ""DOING"", ""POINT"" was selected because it includes high-frequency letters O, N, T (and P) in distinct positions, maximizing the potential for useful feedback on letter presence and position.

<guess>POINT</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- The third letter is ""I"" and in the correct position (✓).
- The letters ""R"", ""A"", ""S"", and ""E"" are not in the word at all (x).

For the second guess:
- The word must have ""I"" as the third letter (position 3).
- It must avoid using the letters R, A, S, or E.
- To maximize information gain, I should prioritize common unused letters (e.g., T, O, N, L, C, H) and avoid repeating letters to test more possibilities.

After evaluating options:
- ""POINT"" fits the criteria: it has ""I"" in position 3, avoids R/A/S/E, and tests new high-frequency letters (T, O, N) and the less common P. This provides broad coverage to narrow down the word list effectively.

Since I have no prior information, I should choose a word that maximizes the information I can gain about the secret word. The best strategy is to use a word with common letters that cover multiple possibilities.\n\nI recall that in games like Wordle, a good starting word often uses common vowels and consonants to cover a broad range of letters.

G-O-I-N-G, so 1-G, 2-O, 3-I, 4-N, 5-G — G is repeated, so not good for information.\n\n""JOINT"": J-O-I-N-T — J is rare.\n\n""MOIST"": M-O-I-S-T — but S is eliminated, we cannot use S because S is not in the word (from feedback, S is x, meaning not in word). So we must avoid S.\n\nSimilarly, we must avoid R, A, E as well.\n\nSo ""MOIST"" has S, which is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""POINT"" is good: P-O-I-N-T, no R,A,S,E.\n\n""BUILT"": B-U-I-L-T, no R,A,S,E.\n\n""THING"": T-H-I-N-G, no R,A,S,E.\n\n""DOING"": D-O-I-N-G, no R,A,S,E.\n\n""FLING"": F-L-I-N-G, no R,A,S,E.\n\n""CLING"": C-L-I-N-G, etc.\n\nNow, among these, which one has the most common letters? ""POINT"" has O, N, T which are high frequency. P is less common, but it\'s acceptable.\n\n""THING"" has T, H, N, G — H and N are good, G is medium.\n\n""DOING"" has O, N, G — O and N are high.\n\nBut ""POINT"" has O, N, T — T is the most common consonant.\n\nWe also want to cover different letters to test more.\n\nSince we know I is in the word and at position 3, we don\'t need to test I again, but we can use it to form the word.\n\nIn the feedback, for the second guess, we will get information about the other positions.\n\nI think ""POINT"" is a good choice: it tests P, O, N, T in positions 1,2,4,5, and we know position 3 is I.\n\nSimilarly, ""THING"" tests T, H, N, G.\n\nBut ""POINT"" might be better because O and T are very common.\n\nAnother word: ""JOINT"" but J is rare.\n\n""MOUNT"": M-O-U-N-T — but U is less common, and we have I at position 3? M-O-U-N-T has U at position 3, not I. We need I at position 3.\n\n""POINT"" seems solid.\n\n""BUILT"" has U, which is less common, but it\'s okay.\n\nI think ""POINT"" is a standard word.\n\nWe could use ""BLIND"": B-L-I-N-D — but L and D are medium, and we avoid R,A,S,E.\n\nBut ""POINT"" has higher frequency letters.\n\nLet\'s compare the frequency sum for the new letters:\n\nFor ""POINT"": P (2%), O (7.5%), N (7%), T (9%) — but we are testing positions 1,2,4,5. Position 3 is I, which we already know, so we don\'t get new info about I, but we use it to form the word.\n\nThe feedback will tell us about P, O, N, T.\n\nSimilarly for ""THING"": T (9%), H (6%), N (7%), G (2%) — T and N are high, H medium, G low.\n\n""POINT"" has O and T high, N high, P low.\n\nO is 7.5%, T 9%, N 7%, P 2% — average better than ""THING"" which has G at 2%.\n\n""DOING"": D (4%), O (7.5%), N (7%), G (2%) — D and G lower.\n\nSo ""POINT"" seems best.\n\nAnother word: ""PRINT"" — but P-R-I-N-T, R is eliminated, we cannot use R. R is not in the word, so avoid.\n\nSimilarly, ""TRAIN"" has R and A, both eliminated.\n\nSo ""POINT"" is good.\n\n""JOINT"" has J, which is very rare.\n\n""QUINT"" has Q and U, Q is rare.\n\nSo I think ""POINT"" is a reasonable choice.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""POINT"" for the second guess.\n\nThought process: Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"", we know that the third letter is \'I\' and that \'R\', \'A\', \'S\', \'E\' are not in the word. Therefore, the second guess must have \'I\' in the third position and avoid using the letters R, A, S, E. The goal is to test new common letters to gather more information. After considering words like ""THING"", ""BUILT"", and ""DOING"", ""POINT"" was selected because it includes high-frequency letters O, N, T (and P) in distinct positions, maximizing the potential for useful feedback on letter presence and position.\n\n<guess>POINT</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- The third letter is ""I"" and in the correct position (✓).\n- The letters ""R"", ""A"", ""S"", and ""E"" are not in the word at all (x).\n\nFor the second guess:\n- The word must have ""I"" as the third letter (position 3).\n- It must avoid using the letters R, A, S, or E.\n- To maximize information gain, I should prioritize common unused letters (e.g., T, O, N, L, C, H) and avoid repeating letters to test more possibilities.\n\nAfter evaluating options:\n- ""POINT"" fits the criteria: it has ""I"" in position 3, avoids R/A/S/E, and tests new high-frequency letters (T, O, N) and the less common P. This provides broad coverage to narrow down the word list effectively.\n\n<guess>POINT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(✓) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(✓) N(x) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:
- Guess 1: RAISE -> R(x), A(x), I(✓), S(x), E(x) → I is correct and in position 3; R, A, S, E not in word.
- Guess 2: POINT -> P(x), O(x), I(✓), N(x), T(x) → I is still ✓ in position 3 (which we knew), and P, O, N, T not in word.

So now we know:
- The third letter is I. No change.
- Additional letters not in the word: P, O, N, T (from POINT), plus R, A, S, E (from RAISE). So total absent letters: R, A, S, E, P, O, N, T.

Letters that could be in the word: from the alphabet, subtract the absent ones.

Absent: A, E, I? Wait, I is in the word, so I is present but we already know its position.

Known present: I (at position 3).

Absent: R, A, S, E, P, O, N, T.

Possible remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we need common English letters, so likely consonants and possibly U or Y as vowels.

Since no other letters have been confirmed present yet except I, we must consider that the word has other letters from the remaining pool.

The word pattern is _ _ I _ _ (5 letters, third is I).

We have used letters: from RAISE: R,A,I,S,E and POINT: P,O,I,N,T. I is repeated, but we knew that.

So letters tested and absent: A,E,P,O,N,T,R,S. That's 8 letters plus E which is already included? List: A, E, R, S, P, O, N, T.

Absent: A, E, R, S, P, O, N, T.

Possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I? I is already in and we know position, so for other positions, we need to guess from letters not absent, excluding I since it's fixed at position 3 but can be used elsewhere? No, I is fixed at position 3, but could it be elsewhere? The feedback only shows that position 3 is I, but it doesn't preclude other I's. For example, in ""CIVIC"", I can appear multiple times.

But in guess 1, we had I as ✓, but the other positions had E, which was absent, so E is not in the word, but I could be duplicate? Let's see the feedback.

For RAISE: I(✓) means the letter in position 3 is correct (I). The other positions: R(x) means R is not in the word at all, similarly A(x), S(x), E(x) mean A, S, E not in word. But it doesn't say anything about additional I's. Similarly for POINT, P(x), O(x), N(x), T(x) mean no P,O,N,T in word, and I(✓) confirms position 3 I.

But since position 3 is I, and no other I was guessed in positions 1,2,4,5, it doesn't tell us if there could be another I. For example, the word could have I at position 3 and say at position 1, but since we didn't guess I elsewhere, we don't know.

In RAISE, position 4 is S, which was absent, but if we had guessed a word with I in other positions, it might show -, but we haven't. So possibly, the word could have multiple I's.

But with only I confirmed, we need to guess words with other letters.

Now, from remaining letters: common ones are B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, U, W, Y.

Vowels: we have U and possibly Y as semi-vowel, but vowels in English are A,E,I,O,U – A,E,O are absent, so U is the only vowel left besides I? But Y can be vowel too.

So possible vowels: I, U, Y.

But I is fixed at position 3, so other positions should have consonants or U/Y.

Possible words: pattern _ _ I _ _

Letters to use from: B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. But J,Q,X,Z are low frequency, so focus on B,C,D,F,G,H,L,M,U,W,Y.

For this guess, we want to test more common letters to find which are present.

Common unused: L, H, D, U, C, M, etc.

So we should construct a word with I at position 3, using letters not eliminated.

For example:

- Words with L: e.g., ""GUIL D"" but D is possible, and we have to avoid absent letters. G,U,I,L,D – no A,E,R,S,P,O,N,T.

""GUILD"" is a word? Yes, GUILD.

Similarly, ""BUILD"" – B,U,I,L,D – same idea.

""CLIMB"" – C,L,I,M,B – and M is possible.

""FLICK"" – F,L,I,C,K – K possible.

""THICK"" but T and H: T is absent, so no, T cannot be used.

T is absent, from POINT feedback T(x), so avoid T.

Similarly O,N,P absent.

So letters to avoid: A,E,R,S,P,O,N,T.

Letters to use: B,C,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. High frequency: C, D, F, G, H, L, M.

Now, possible words:

With U: since it's a vowel, might be good to test.

e.g., ""QUICK"" but Q is uncommon, and we have U,I,C,K.

""BUILD"": B,U,I,L,D

""GUILT"" but T absent, so no.

""GUILD"" is good.

""FLUID"": F,L,U,I,D – avoids absent letters.

""CLUMP"" but P absent? P is absent, yes.

P absent, so cannot use P.

""JUICE"" but E absent? E is absent, so no.

""DUCHY"" – D,U,C,H,Y – all valid? D,U,C,H,Y not absent.

Y is possible.

Another word: ""LUCKY"" – L,U,C,K,Y – but position 3 must be I? Pattern must have I at position 3, so ""LUCKY"" is L-U-C-K-Y, no I, so not acceptable. Must have I at position 3.

So only words with I in the middle.

""QUILT"" but T absent, no.

""BUILD"": B(1), U(2), I(3), L(4), D(5) – BUILD is a word.

""GUILD"": G(1), U(2), I(3), L(4), D(5) – same as BUILD with G.

""FLUID"": F(1), L(2), U(3)? Wait no, FLUID is F-L-U-I-D, positions: 1-F, 2-L, 3-U? But we need I at position 3. F-L-U-I-D has U at position 3, I at position 4. We need position 3 to be I.

So must be ? ? I ? ?, so first two letters, then I, then last two.

So ""BUILD"" is B-U-I-L-D, so 1-B,2-U,3-I,4-L,5-D. Good.

""GUILD"" similarly G-U-I-L-D.

""CLINK"": C-L-I-N-K but N absent, N is eliminated, so cannot use N.

From POINT, N(x), so absent.

Similarly ""BLIMP"" has P, absent.

""CHILD"": C-H-I-L-D – avoids absent letters? H,L,C,D possible.

C-H-I-L-D: positions 1-C,2-H,3-I,4-L,5-D.

Similarly ""MILD"": M-I-L-D but I at position 2? M-I-L-D has only four positions? Must be five letters.

""MILKY"": M-I-L-K-Y, position 1-M,2-I, then 3-L, but we need position 3 to be I, not L. So it must be I at 3.

""CHILL"": C-H-I-L-L, but double L, repeats, reduces information.

Better to avoid repeats if possible.

""GRIMY"": G-R-I-M-Y but R absent, cannot use R.

R is absent.

""WHINY"": W-H-I-N-Y but N absent.

So possible options without repeats: ""BUILD"", ""GUILD"", ""CHILD"", ""FILMY"" (but FILMY has Y, meaning covered with film), F-I-L-M-Y? Positions: 1-F,2-I? Not 3-I.

We need position 3 to be I.

""CHILD"": C-H-I-L-D, perfect.

""FIELD"": F-I-E-L-D but E absent? E is absent, from RAISE, E(x), so cannot use E.

So ""FIELD"" invalid.

""YIELD"": Y-I-E-L-D, has E, absent.

No.

""GUILT"" has T, absent.

So back to ""BUILD"", ""GUILD"", ""CHILD"".

""CIVIC"": C-I-V-I-C, has I at position 2 and 4, but position 3 is V? Position: 1-C,2-I,3-V,4-I,5-C. Position 3 is V, not I. So not I at 3.

We must have I at position 3.

""VALID"": V-A-L-I-D but A absent, no.

So ""CHILD"": C,H,I,L,D – letters C,H,L,D possible.

""BUILD"": B,U,I,L,D

""GUILD"": G,U,I,L,D

""FLUID"": F-L-U-I-D, position 3 is U? F-L-U-I-D, so 1=F,2=L,3=U,4=I,5=D. Position 3 is U, not I. So only if position 3 is I.

What about ""QUIET""? Q-U-I-E-T, but E and T absent, no.

""QUILL"" double L, and position? Q-U-I-L-L, positions 1-Q,2-U,3-I,4-L,5-L. So it has I at 3.

But double L repeats.

Better to avoid if possible.

""SKIMP"" S absent? S is absent.

We have U for vowel or Y.

Another word: ""CLIMB"": C-L-I-M-B, that could work: C,L,I,M,B.

""MOLDY"" no I.

""CHIME"": C-H-I-M-E, E absent.

No.

""WHILE"" W-H-I-L-E, E absent.

So back to: ""CHILD"", ""BUILD"", ""GUILD"", or ""JUICE"" but E absent, not.

""BLUID""? Not a word.

Perhaps ""FLUID"" cannot because position 3 not I.

Unless it's spelled F-L-U-I-D, but L-U-I, position 3 U, not I.

Standard spelling, position varies.

Another word: ""BRICK"" B-R-I-C-K, but R absent.

R is gone.

""PRICK"" P and R absent.

""THICK"" T absent.

So available: ""CHILD"" seems good: C-H-I-L-D.

""CHILL"" double L.

""GUIDE"" G-U-I-D-E, E absent.

""QUICK"" Q-U-I-C-K, that is Q-U-I-C-K, positions 1-Q,2-U,3-I,4-C,5-K. So it has I at 3.

Similarly, ""QUACK"" no I.

So ""QUICK"" is an option, but Q is uncommon, so might not be the secret word, but it could be.

But we want to test common letters.

""QUICK"": Q,U,I,C,K – letters Q,U,C,K.

Q and K are less common, U and C medium.

Compared to ""CHILD"": C,H,L,D – C,H,L,D more common than Q,U,C,K? C is in both, H,L,D vs U,K,Q.

H is 6%, L 4%, D 4%, U 2.5%, K 1%, Q very low.

So ""CHILD"" tests H,L,D which are better than U,K,Q.

But ""QUICK"" tests U and C.

Since C is common, testing it might be good.

But let's see another option.

""BUILD"": B,U,I,L,D – B low frequency, U medium, L,D medium.

Similarly ""GUILD"": G,U,I,L,D – G low.

""CHILD"": C,H,I,L,D – C,H,L,D all medium frequency.

C:3%, H:6%, L:4%, D:4%.

Not bad.

""DWARF"" no I.

Perhaps ""CHIMY"" not a word.

I think ""CHILD"" or ""BUILD"" are fine.

Also, with U, we can use ""BUILD"" to test U.

U is the only vowel possibility left besides Y, so it might be important to test it.

In ""BUILD"", U is at position 2.

Similarly in ""CHILD"", H is at position 2.

Both are consonants? H is consonant, U is vowel.

Since we lack vowel information, testing U might be valuable.

For example, if U is present, we get more clues.

If not, we eliminate it.

Similarly for Y.

But Y is less common.

So perhaps ""BUILD"" to test U.

""GUILD"" same.

Or ""QUICK"", but Q is rare.

Let's decide.

Perhaps a word like ""LYMPH"" no I.

Another one: ""WIMPY"" W-I-M-P-Y, position 3 not I.

Not.

So between ""CHILD"" and ""BUILD"", I'll choose ""CHILD"" because it avoids U which might be less necessary, but U could be key.

Since A,E,O are absent, U might be in the word or not.

At this point, with few guesses left, we need to be efficient.

Perhaps list possible words.

The secret word has I at position 3, no R,A,S,E,P,O,N,T.

Possible words:

- With C: CHILD, CHINK? But N absent, CHINK has N which is absent? CHINK has N, but N absent.

From POINT, N(x), so N absent.

So CHILD is good.

FLUID not, position wrong.

GUILD good.

BLIND: B-L-I-N-D, N absent, no.

BUILD good.

CLIMB: C-L-I-M-B, good.

DUTCH: D-U-T-C-H, T absent.

Invalid.

LUCK: not 5 letters.

JUMBO: no I.

So shortlist:

- BUILD (B,U,I,L,D)

- GUILD (G,U,I,L,D)

- CHILD (C,H,I,L,D)

- CLIMB (C,L,I,M,B)

- JUICE? J,U,I,C,E but E absent.

Not.

QUICK (Q,U,I,C,K)

 But Q and K uncommon.

Other words like: PHYLC not a word.

MYTHIC not 5 letters.

So realistic: BUILD, GUILD, CHILD, CLIMB.

CLIMB has B, which is low freq, but possible.

To maximize new letters, let's see what each tests.

For example:
- BUILD: tests B,U,L,D
- GUILD: tests G,U,L,D
- CHILD: tests C,H,L,D
- CLIMB: tests C,L,M,B

All test L and one more consonant plus U or not.

In CHILD, H is tested, in BUILD U is tested.

Since U is a vowel possibility, it might be worth testing.

Moreover, U is more common than H? H: 6%, U: 2.5%, so H is more common, but U as vowel may be critical.

Perhaps ""FIC us"" not a word.

""BLUID"" not standard.

I think both are fine.

Perhaps choose ""BUILD"" to check if U is present.

But let's set the strategy.

We have only one letter known, so we need to find the other four.

After this guess, we will get feedback.

So for this turn, guess one of these.

I'll go with ""CHILD"" for now.

But CHILD has H and L, etc.

Another word: ""MILCH"" M-I-L-C-H, position 2 I? Must be position 3 I.

Not.

""WICCA"" no I.

So I think ""CHILD"" is reasonable.

Or ""BLIMP"" but P absent.

No.

""GRIMY"" G-R-I-M-Y, R absent.

So CHILD it is.

But we can think of frequency.

Most common remaining letters: C, H, D, L, U, M, etc.

C has 3%, L 4%, H 6%, D 4%, U 2.5%, M 2.5%.

Average.

Perhaps ""CLIMB"" tests M.

But BUILD tests U.

Let's see if there is a word with multiple high frequency.

For example, ""CULLY"" but U and L I position? C-U-L-L-Y, position 3 L, not I.

Not.

""DILLY"" D-I-L-L-Y, position 2 I.

Not.

""GILLY"" similar.

I think ""CHILD"" or ""BUILD"" are the way to go.

I'll choose ""CHILD"" to test H and C.

So guess: CHILD

Thought process: Based on accumulated feedback:
- Position 3 is ""I"".
- Absent letters: R, A, S, E, P, O, N, T.
- The second guess ""POINT"" ruled out P, O, N, T aside from confirming position 3.
For the third guess, we need a 5-letter word with ""I"" at position 3, using only untested letters from the remaining pool (B,C,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,U,W,Y,Z). Priority is to test common consonants like C, L, H, D and vowel U.
After considering options such as ""BUILD"", ""GUILD"", ""CLIMB"", and ""QUICK"", ""CHILD"" is selected because it contains high-utility letters C, H, L, D (all distinct and reasonably common), avoiding rare letters and focusing on likely consonants. If ""CHILD"" is incorrect, the feedback willprovide new presence/absence information for C, H, L, D and their positions.

<guess>CHILD</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- Guess 1 ""RAISE"": I is correct and in position 3; R, A, S, E are absent.
- Guess 2 ""POINT"": I is still correct in position 3; P, O, N, T are absent.
- Total absent letters: A, E, R, S, P, O, N, T.  
- Position 3 is confirmed as ""I"".  
- Available letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, W, Y (common English letters from remaining pool).  

For the third guess:  
- Must have ""I"" in position 3 (pattern: _ _ I _ _).  
- Avoid all absent letters.  
- Prioritize testing high-frequency unused letters like C, L, H, D, U to maximize information gain.  
- Words evaluated:  
  - ""BUILD"" (tests B, U, L, D) – good for U (vowel test), but U less common.  
  - ""GUILD"" (tests G, U, L, D) – similar, G low frequency.  
  - ""CLIMB"" (tests C, L, M, B) – adds M but weak vowel coverage.  
  - ""CHILD"" (tests C, H, L, D) – optimal: C, H, L, D are high-value consonant tests; all letters distinct and moderate frequency.  

**Selected ""CHILD""**: Tests C, H, L, D—common letters not yet examined—and uses position 3 ""I"". Feedback will reveal new presences/absences and positions (especially for H, a frequent consonant, and potential vowel substitutes like Y).

<guess>CHILD</guess>",CHILD,"We have feedback from two guesses:
- Guess 1: RAISE -> R(x), A(x), I(✓), S(x), E(x) → I is correct and in position 3; R, A, S, E not in word.
- Guess 2: POINT -> P(x), O(x), I(✓), N(x), T(x) → I is still ✓ in position 3 (which we knew), and P, O, N, T not in word.

So now we know:
- The third letter is I. No change.
- Additional letters not in the word: P, O, N, T (from POINT), plus R, A, S, E (from RAISE). So total absent letters: R, A, S, E, P, O, N, T.

Letters that could be in the word: from the alphabet, subtract the absent ones.

Absent: A, E, I? Wait, I is in the word, so I is present but we already know its position.

Known present: I (at position 3).

Absent: R, A, S, E, P, O, N, T.

Possible remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we need common English letters, so likely consonants and possibly U or Y as vowels.

Since no other letters have been confirmed present yet except I, we must consider that the word has other letters from the remaining pool.

The word pattern is _ _ I _ _ (5 letters, third is I).

We have used letters: from RAISE: R,A,I,S,E and POINT: P,O,I,N,T. I is repeated, but we knew that.

So letters tested and absent: A,E,P,O,N,T,R,S. That's 8 letters plus E which is already included? List: A, E, R, S, P, O, N, T.

Absent: A, E, R, S, P, O, N, T.

Possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I? I is already in and we know position, so for other positions, we need to guess from letters not absent, excluding I since it's fixed at position 3 but can be used elsewhere? No, I is fixed at position 3, but could it be elsewhere? The feedback only shows that position 3 is I, but it doesn't preclude other I's. For example, in ""CIVIC"", I can appear multiple times.

But in guess 1, we had I as ✓, but the other positions had E, which was absent, so E is not in the word, but I could be duplicate? Let's see the feedback.

For RAISE: I(✓) means the letter in position 3 is correct (I). The other positions: R(x) means R is not in the word at all, similarly A(x), S(x), E(x) mean A, S, E not in word. But it doesn't say anything about additional I's. Similarly for POINT, P(x), O(x), N(x), T(x) mean no P,O,N,T in word, and I(✓) confirms position 3 I.

But since position 3 is I, and no other I was guessed in positions 1,2,4,5, it doesn't tell us if there could be another I. For example, the word could have I at position 3 and say at position 1, but since we didn't guess I elsewhere, we don't know.

In RAISE, position 4 is S, which was absent, but if we had guessed a word with I in other positions, it might show -, but we haven't. So possibly, the word could have multiple I's.

But with only I confirmed, we need to guess words with other letters.

Now, from remaining letters: common ones are B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, U, W, Y.

Vowels: we have U and possibly Y as semi-vowel, but vowels in English are A,E,I,O,U – A,E,O are absent, so U is the only vowel left besides I? But Y can be vowel too.

So possible vowels: I, U, Y.

But I is fixed at position 3, so other positions should have consonants or U/Y.

Possible words: pattern _ _ I _ _

Letters to use from: B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. But J,Q,X,Z are low frequency, so focus on B,C,D,F,G,H,L,M,U,W,Y.

For this guess, we want to test more common letters to find which are present.

Common unused: L, H, D, U, C, M, etc.

So we should construct a word with I at position 3, using letters not eliminated.

For example:

- Words with L: e.g., ""GUIL D"" but D is possible, and we have to avoid absent letters. G,U,I,L,D – no A,E,R,S,P,O,N,T.

""GUILD"" is a word? Yes, GUILD.

Similarly, ""BUILD"" – B,U,I,L,D – same idea.

""CLIMB"" – C,L,I,M,B – and M is possible.

""FLICK"" – F,L,I,C,K – K possible.

""THICK"" but T and H: T is absent, so no, T cannot be used.

T is absent, from POINT feedback T(x), so avoid T.

Similarly O,N,P absent.

So letters to avoid: A,E,R,S,P,O,N,T.

Letters to use: B,C,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. High frequency: C, D, F, G, H, L, M.

Now, possible words:

With U: since it's a vowel, might be good to test.

e.g., ""QUICK"" but Q is uncommon, and we have U,I,C,K.

""BUILD"": B,U,I,L,D

""GUILT"" but T absent, so no.

""GUILD"" is good.

""FLUID"": F,L,U,I,D – avoids absent letters.

""CLUMP"" but P absent? P is absent, yes.

P absent, so cannot use P.

""JUICE"" but E absent? E is absent, so no.

""DUCHY"" – D,U,C,H,Y – all valid? D,U,C,H,Y not absent.

Y is possible.

Another word: ""LUCKY"" – L,U,C,K,Y – but position 3 must be I? Pattern must have I at position 3, so ""LUCKY"" is L-U-C-K-Y, no I, so not acceptable. Must have I at position 3.

So only words with I in the middle.

""QUILT"" but T absent, no.

""BUILD"": B(1), U(2), I(3), L(4), D(5) – BUILD is a word.

""GUILD"": G(1), U(2), I(3), L(4), D(5) – same as BUILD with G.

""FLUID"": F(1), L(2), U(3)? Wait no, FLUID is F-L-U-I-D, positions: 1-F, 2-L, 3-U? But we need I at position 3. F-L-U-I-D has U at position 3, I at position 4. We need position 3 to be I.

So must be ? ? I ? ?, so first two letters, then I, then last two.

So ""BUILD"" is B-U-I-L-D, so 1-B,2-U,3-I,4-L,5-D. Good.

""GUILD"" similarly G-U-I-L-D.

""CLINK"": C-L-I-N-K but N absent, N is eliminated, so cannot use N.

From POINT, N(x), so absent.

Similarly ""BLIMP"" has P, absent.

""CHILD"": C-H-I-L-D – avoids absent letters? H,L,C,D possible.

C-H-I-L-D: positions 1-C,2-H,3-I,4-L,5-D.

Similarly ""MILD"": M-I-L-D but I at position 2? M-I-L-D has only four positions? Must be five letters.

""MILKY"": M-I-L-K-Y, position 1-M,2-I, then 3-L, but we need position 3 to be I, not L. So it must be I at 3.

""CHILL"": C-H-I-L-L, but double L, repeats, reduces information.

Better to avoid repeats if possible.

""GRIMY"": G-R-I-M-Y but R absent, cannot use R.

R is absent.

""WHINY"": W-H-I-N-Y but N absent.

So possible options without repeats: ""BUILD"", ""GUILD"", ""CHILD"", ""FILMY"" (but FILMY has Y, meaning covered with film), F-I-L-M-Y? Positions: 1-F,2-I? Not 3-I.

We need position 3 to be I.

""CHILD"": C-H-I-L-D, perfect.

""FIELD"": F-I-E-L-D but E absent? E is absent, from RAISE, E(x), so cannot use E.

So ""FIELD"" invalid.

""YIELD"": Y-I-E-L-D, has E, absent.

No.

""GUILT"" has T, absent.

So back to ""BUILD"", ""GUILD"", ""CHILD"".

""CIVIC"": C-I-V-I-C, has I at position 2 and 4, but position 3 is V? Position: 1-C,2-I,3-V,4-I,5-C. Position 3 is V, not I. So not I at 3.

We must have I at position 3.

""VALID"": V-A-L-I-D but A absent, no.

So ""CHILD"": C,H,I,L,D – letters C,H,L,D possible.

""BUILD"": B,U,I,L,D

""GUILD"": G,U,I,L,D

""FLUID"": F-L-U-I-D, position 3 is U? F-L-U-I-D, so 1=F,2=L,3=U,4=I,5=D. Position 3 is U, not I. So only if position 3 is I.

What about ""QUIET""? Q-U-I-E-T, but E and T absent, no.

""QUILL"" double L, and position? Q-U-I-L-L, positions 1-Q,2-U,3-I,4-L,5-L. So it has I at 3.

But double L repeats.

Better to avoid if possible.

""SKIMP"" S absent? S is absent.

We have U for vowel or Y.

Another word: ""CLIMB"": C-L-I-M-B, that could work: C,L,I,M,B.

""MOLDY"" no I.

""CHIME"": C-H-I-M-E, E absent.

No.

""WHILE"" W-H-I-L-E, E absent.

So back to: ""CHILD"", ""BUILD"", ""GUILD"", or ""JUICE"" but E absent, not.

""BLUID""? Not a word.

Perhaps ""FLUID"" cannot because position 3 not I.

Unless it's spelled F-L-U-I-D, but L-U-I, position 3 U, not I.

Standard spelling, position varies.

Another word: ""BRICK"" B-R-I-C-K, but R absent.

R is gone.

""PRICK"" P and R absent.

""THICK"" T absent.

So available: ""CHILD"" seems good: C-H-I-L-D.

""CHILL"" double L.

""GUIDE"" G-U-I-D-E, E absent.

""QUICK"" Q-U-I-C-K, that is Q-U-I-C-K, positions 1-Q,2-U,3-I,4-C,5-K. So it has I at 3.

Similarly, ""QUACK"" no I.

So ""QUICK"" is an option, but Q is uncommon, so might not be the secret word, but it could be.

But we want to test common letters.

""QUICK"": Q,U,I,C,K – letters Q,U,C,K.

Q and K are less common, U and C medium.

Compared to ""CHILD"": C,H,L,D – C,H,L,D more common than Q,U,C,K? C is in both, H,L,D vs U,K,Q.

H is 6%, L 4%, D 4%, U 2.5%, K 1%, Q very low.

So ""CHILD"" tests H,L,D which are better than U,K,Q.

But ""QUICK"" tests U and C.

Since C is common, testing it might be good.

But let's see another option.

""BUILD"": B,U,I,L,D – B low frequency, U medium, L,D medium.

Similarly ""GUILD"": G,U,I,L,D – G low.

""CHILD"": C,H,I,L,D – C,H,L,D all medium frequency.

C:3%, H:6%, L:4%, D:4%.

Not bad.

""DWARF"" no I.

Perhaps ""CHIMY"" not a word.

I think ""CHILD"" or ""BUILD"" are fine.

Also, with U, we can use ""BUILD"" to test U.

U is the only vowel possibility left besides Y, so it might be important to test it.

In ""BUILD"", U is at position 2.

Similarly in ""CHILD"", H is at position 2.

Both are consonants? H is consonant, U is vowel.

Since we lack vowel information, testing U might be valuable.

For example, if U is present, we get more clues.

If not, we eliminate it.

Similarly for Y.

But Y is less common.

So perhaps ""BUILD"" to test U.

""GUILD"" same.

Or ""QUICK"", but Q is rare.

Let's decide.

Perhaps a word like ""LYMPH"" no I.

Another one: ""WIMPY"" W-I-M-P-Y, position 3 not I.

Not.

So between ""CHILD"" and ""BUILD"", I'll choose ""CHILD"" because it avoids U which might be less necessary, but U could be key.

Since A,E,O are absent, U might be in the word or not.

At this point, with few guesses left, we need to be efficient.

Perhaps list possible words.

The secret word has I at position 3, no R,A,S,E,P,O,N,T.

Possible words:

- With C: CHILD, CHINK? But N absent, CHINK has N which is absent? CHINK has N, but N absent.

From POINT, N(x), so N absent.

So CHILD is good.

FLUID not, position wrong.

GUILD good.

BLIND: B-L-I-N-D, N absent, no.

BUILD good.

CLIMB: C-L-I-M-B, good.

DUTCH: D-U-T-C-H, T absent.

Invalid.

LUCK: not 5 letters.

JUMBO: no I.

So shortlist:

- BUILD (B,U,I,L,D)

- GUILD (G,U,I,L,D)

- CHILD (C,H,I,L,D)

- CLIMB (C,L,I,M,B)

- JUICE? J,U,I,C,E but E absent.

Not.

QUICK (Q,U,I,C,K)

 But Q and K uncommon.

Other words like: PHYLC not a word.

MYTHIC not 5 letters.

So realistic: BUILD, GUILD, CHILD, CLIMB.

CLIMB has B, which is low freq, but possible.

To maximize new letters, let's see what each tests.

For example:
- BUILD: tests B,U,L,D
- GUILD: tests G,U,L,D
- CHILD: tests C,H,L,D
- CLIMB: tests C,L,M,B

All test L and one more consonant plus U or not.

In CHILD, H is tested, in BUILD U is tested.

Since U is a vowel possibility, it might be worth testing.

Moreover, U is more common than H? H: 6%, U: 2.5%, so H is more common, but U as vowel may be critical.

Perhaps ""FIC us"" not a word.

""BLUID"" not standard.

I think both are fine.

Perhaps choose ""BUILD"" to check if U is present.

But let's set the strategy.

We have only one letter known, so we need to find the other four.

After this guess, we will get feedback.

So for this turn, guess one of these.

I'll go with ""CHILD"" for now.

But CHILD has H and L, etc.

Another word: ""MILCH"" M-I-L-C-H, position 2 I? Must be position 3 I.

Not.

""WICCA"" no I.

So I think ""CHILD"" is reasonable.

Or ""BLIMP"" but P absent.

No.

""GRIMY"" G-R-I-M-Y, R absent.

So CHILD it is.

But we can think of frequency.

Most common remaining letters: C, H, D, L, U, M, etc.

C has 3%, L 4%, H 6%, D 4%, U 2.5%, M 2.5%.

Average.

Perhaps ""CLIMB"" tests M.

But BUILD tests U.

Let's see if there is a word with multiple high frequency.

For example, ""CULLY"" but U and L I position? C-U-L-L-Y, position 3 L, not I.

Not.

""DILLY"" D-I-L-L-Y, position 2 I.

Not.

""GILLY"" similar.

I think ""CHILD"" or ""BUILD"" are the way to go.

I'll choose ""CHILD"" to test H and C.

So guess: CHILD

Thought process: Based on accumulated feedback:
- Position 3 is ""I"".
- Absent letters: R, A, S, E, P, O, N, T.
- The second guess ""POINT"" ruled out P, O, N, T aside from confirming position 3.
For the third guess, we need a 5-letter word with ""I"" at position 3, using only untested letters from the remaining pool (B,C,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,U,W,Y,Z). Priority is to test common consonants like C, L, H, D and vowel U.
After considering options such as ""BUILD"", ""GUILD"", ""CLIMB"", and ""QUICK"", ""CHILD"" is selected because it contains high-utility letters C, H, L, D (all distinct and reasonably common), avoiding rare letters and focusing on likely consonants. If ""CHILD"" is incorrect, the feedback willprovide new presence/absence information for C, H, L, D and their positions.

<guess>CHILD</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- Guess 1 ""RAISE"": I is correct and in position 3; R, A, S, E are absent.
- Guess 2 ""POINT"": I is still correct in position 3; P, O, N, T are absent.
- Total absent letters: A, E, R, S, P, O, N, T.  
- Position 3 is confirmed as ""I"".  
- Available letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, W, Y (common English letters from remaining pool).  

For the third guess:  
- Must have ""I"" in position 3 (pattern: _ _ I _ _).  
- Avoid all absent letters.  
- Prioritize testing high-frequency unused letters like C, L, H, D, U to maximize information gain.  
- Words evaluated:  
  - ""BUILD"" (tests B, U, L, D) – good for U (vowel test), but U less common.  
  - ""GUILD"" (tests G, U, L, D) – similar, G low frequency.  
  - ""CLIMB"" (tests C, L, M, B) – adds M but weak vowel coverage.  
  - ""CHILD"" (tests C, H, L, D) – optimal: C, H, L, D are high-value consonant tests; all letters distinct and moderate frequency.  

**Selected ""CHILD""**: Tests C, H, L, D—common letters not yet examined—and uses position 3 ""I"". Feedback will reveal new presences/absences and positions (especially for H, a frequent consonant, and potential vowel substitutes like Y).",Guess 3: CHILD -> FEEDBACK: C(-) H(x) I(✓) L(x) D(x),FAIL

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>First, I need to make my first guess for a 5-letter word. Since I have no prior information, I should choose a word that maximizes the information I can gain about the secret word. The best strategy is to use a word with common letters that cover multiple possibilities.

I recall that in games like Wordle, a good starting word often uses common vowels and consonants to cover a broad range of letters. This helps in narrowing down the possibilities based on the feedback.

Common vowels in English are A, E, I, O, U. Common consonants include S, T, N, R, H, L, D, etc.

A popular starting word is ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" because they include frequent letters. Another one is ""ADIEU"", which has many vowels, but since there are only five positions, I need a balance of vowels and consonants.

I should aim for a word with at least two vowels and three consonants to get a good spread.

Let me think of some options:

- ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E – includes common letters S, T, E, A.

- ""CRANE"": C, R, A, N, E – similar, with R, A, N, E.

- ""ROATE"": R, O, A, T, E – which is a less common word but has good coverage.

I need to ensure the word is valid. ""ROATE"" might not be universally recognized; it's better to choose a common word.

""ARISE"" is another good one: A, R, I, S, E – covers vowels A, I, E and consonants R, S.

Or ""IRATE"": I, R, A, T, E.

From feedback perspective, having distinct letters is important so that I can get clear information. If there are repeating letters, it might complicate the feedback, especially for the first guess. So, I should avoid words with duplicate letters.

For example, ""BOOKS"" has repeated O and S, so not ideal. Or ""SPOON"" with double O.

Therefore, I'll avoid repeats.

Suggested words without repeats: ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ADIEU"" (but A and E are vowels, D and U, U is less common), ""STERN"", ""PAINT"", etc.

""ADIEU"" might be good for vowels, but consonants are D, which is medium frequency.

In terms of letter frequency in English words, here's a rough order: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, etc.

So, a word like ""STARE"" – S, T, A, R, E – covers S, T, A, R, E, all high frequency letters.

Similarly, ""CARES"" or ""SLANT"".

""RESIN"": R, E, S, I, N – has R, E, S, I, N.

I think ""STARE"" is a solid choice.

But let's confirm if it's valid. Yes, ""stare"" is a common English word.

""RAISE"" is similar: R, A, I, S, E.

Either is fine.

I'll go with ""RAISE"" for my first guess because it has R, A, I, S, E – four vowels? A, I, E are vowels, R and S are consonants. Vowels: A, I, E; consonants: R, S.

In five letters: positions: 1-R, 2-A, 3-I, 4-S, 5-E.

Yes.

I could use ""CRATE"" or ""SLATE"", but ""RAISE"" seems good.

Another popular one is ""OUIJA"" but that's not as common and has U, which might not be optimal.

I think ""RAISE"" or ""SLATE"" are standard.

Let me choose ""RAISE"" for now.

But the goal is to maximize entropy, meaning that after the guess, the feedback should help reduce the possible word set as much as possible.

Based on studies, words like ""SOARE"" or ""ROATE"" are often recommended, but they are obscure. Better to stick with common words.

""ARISE"" is essentially the same as ""RAISE"", just different starting letter.

I'll use ""ARISE"": A, R, I, S, E.

Same letters.

Perhaps ""STEAM"": S, T, E, A, M – includes M, which is medium frequency.

But ""ARISE"" has higher frequency letters.

E is the most common, then A, R, I, S are all top 10 or so.

Letter frequencies: E is about 12%, T 9%, A 8%, O 7.5%, I 7%, N 7%, S 6.5%, H 6%, R 6%, D 4%, L 4%, etc.

""ARISE"" has A, R, I, S, E – A:8%, R:6%, I:7%, S:6.5%, E:12%. Good coverage.

""SLATE"" has S:6.5%, L:4%, A:8%, T:9%, E:12% – similar, with T instead of I, and L vs R.

T is more common than R or I? T 9% vs R 6%, I 7%, so T is higher.

""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E – L is less common at 4%, while R is 6%. So ""CRATE"" might be better: C: 3%, R:6%, A:8%, T:9%, E:12% – C is lower frequency.

How about ""TRACE"": T, R, A, C, E – again, C is low.

""STARE"": S, T, A, R, E – S:6.5%, T:9%, A:8%, R:6%, E:12%. All solid.

I think ""STARE"" is slightly better because of higher T frequency.

Similarly, ""CRANE"" has N instead of T; N is 7%.

But T is 9%, so ""STARE"" or ""SLATE"".

""SLATE"" has L at 4%, while ""STARE"" has R at 6%, so ""STARE"" has a slightly better average frequency.

I can go with ""STARE"".

But ""RAISE"" has I at 7% vs L in ""SLATE"" at 4%, so ""RAISE"" might be comparable.

No real difference; I'll pick one.

For consistency, I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it's often used, but let's decide.

Since I need to output the guess, I'll go with ""ARISE"".

But in the system prompt, it used ""STORM"" as an example, so any valid word is fine.

I think ""ARISE"" is good.

Let me make a choice.

I'll use ""SALET"" which is a word, but not common; ""salet"" is historical, may not be known. Better avoid.

""ALERT"" is good: A, L, E, R, T.

But I think ""ARISE"" is fine.

To save time, I'll go with ""RAISE"".

Final decision: ""RAISE""

So for the response, I need to think step by step, then output the guess.

Thought process: As this is the first guess with no prior information, I should select a word that contains common letters to maximize the likelihood of getting feedback on frequent vowels and consonants. This helps in narrowing down the possible word list for subsequent guesses. After considering options like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", and ""STARE"", I choose ""RAISE"" as it includes high-frequency letters such as R, A, I, S, and E without any repeats.

Then output in the format.Since this is the first guess, there is no prior feedback to consider. The goal is to choose a starting word that maximizes information gain by including high-frequency letters (vowels and consonants) to narrow down possibilities quickly. After evaluating common options:
- Vowels like A, E, I are frequent and help identify core word structure.
- Consonants like R, S are also common and versatile.
Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""STARE"" are often effective, but ""RAISE"" was selected for its balance:
  - It contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two consonants (R, S), with all letters distinct to avoid ambiguity.
  - Letter frequencies: R (approx. 6%), A (8%), I (7%), S (6.5%), E (12%) cover a broad range of common English letters.
This choice increases the chance of getting useful position or presence feedback to inform later guesses.

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(✓) S(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- I: ✓ (correct position, so the third letter is I)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, from this, we know:
- The third letter is I.
- The letters R, A, S, E are not in the word at all.
- Therefore, the secret word has I as the third letter, and does not contain R, A, S, E.

Now, we need to make a second guess. The guess must be a 5-letter word with I in the third position, and it should avoid using R, A, S, E.

We also want to use this guess to test other common letters to gather more information.

Since I is fixed at position 3, we have to form a word with the pattern _ _ I _ _

We should choose letters that are common and not yet tested. From the first guess, we have eliminated R, A, S, E. So we have to avoid these.

Common letters left: T, O, N, H, L, D, C, U, M, P, etc.

We should aim to include as many new, common letters as possible in the guess.

Possible words that fit the pattern _ _ I _ _ and don't use R, A, S, E:

Let's think of some words:
- With T: e.g., ""POINT"" (P, O, I, N, T) — but we have to check if it avoids R,A,S,E. P, O, I, N, T — yes, none of R,A,S,E.
- ""BUILT"" (B, U, I, L, T) — avoids R,A,S,E.
- ""GUILD"" (G, U, I, L, D) — avoids R,A,S,E.
- ""CHILL"" (C, H, I, L, L) — but has double L, which might not be ideal because it reduces the number of distinct letters. Better to avoid repeats if possible to get more information.
- ""THING"" (T, H, I, N, G) — avoids R,A,S,E.

We want to maximize the number of new letters tested.

Letters we haven't used: from the first guess we used R,A,I,S,E. So we have I already known, but we are testing other positions.

In the second guess, we can test T, O, N, H, L, D, C, U, M, P, etc.

Let's list the frequency: T (9%), O (7.5%), N (7%), H (6%), L (4%), D (4%), C (3%), U (2.5%), M (2.5%), P (2%), etc.

So, high frequency: T, O, N, H.

We should try to include T, O, N, H if possible.

Word with I in the middle and including T, O, N, H.

For example:
- ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T — includes O, N, T (and P). P is less common, but O, N, T are good.
- ""THINK"": T, H, I, N, K — includes T, H, N, K. K is less common, but T, H, N are good.
- ""LIGHT"": L, I, G, H, T — but I is at position 2, not 3. We need I at position 3.
- ""NIGHT"": N, I, G, H, T — I is at position 2? N-I-G-H-T, so positions: 1-N, 2-I, 3-G, 4-H, 5-T. But we need I at position 3, so that's not it.

We need the third letter to be I, so pattern: ? ? I ? ?

So for ""NIGHT"", it's N-I-G-H-T, so I is at position 2, not 3.

Similarly, ""POINT"": P-O-I-N-T, so positions: 1-P, 2-O, 3-I, 4-N, 5-T. Perfect.

""BUILT"": B-U-I-L-T, so 1-B, 2-U, 3-I, 4-L, 5-T.

""GUILD"": G-U-I-L-D, 1-G, 2-U, 3-I, 4-L, 5-D.

""CHILL"": C-H-I-L-L, 1-C, 2-H, 3-I, 4-L, 5-L — but double L, so not ideal.

""THING"": T-H-I-N-G, 1-T, 2-H, 3-I, 4-N, 5-G.

""DOING"": D-O-I-N-G, 1-D, 2-O, 3-I, 4-N, 5-G.

""GOING"": G-O-I-N-G, but has double G? G-O-I-N-G, so 1-G, 2-O, 3-I, 4-N, 5-G — G is repeated, so not good for information.

""JOINT"": J-O-I-N-T — J is rare.

""MOIST"": M-O-I-S-T — but S is eliminated, we cannot use S because S is not in the word (from feedback, S is x, meaning not in word). So we must avoid S.

Similarly, we must avoid R, A, E as well.

So ""MOIST"" has S, which is invalid.

Similarly, ""POINT"" is good: P-O-I-N-T, no R,A,S,E.

""BUILT"": B-U-I-L-T, no R,A,S,E.

""THING"": T-H-I-N-G, no R,A,S,E.

""DOING"": D-O-I-N-G, no R,A,S,E.

""FLING"": F-L-I-N-G, no R,A,S,E.

""CLING"": C-L-I-N-G, etc.

Now, among these, which one has the most common letters? ""POINT"" has O, N, T which are high frequency. P is less common, but it's acceptable.

""THING"" has T, H, N, G — H and N are good, G is medium.

""DOING"" has O, N, G — O and N are high.

But ""POINT"" has O, N, T — T is the most common consonant.

We also want to cover different letters to test more.

Since we know I is in the word and at position 3, we don't need to test I again, but we can use it to form the word.

In the feedback, for the second guess, we will get information about the other positions.

I think ""POINT"" is a good choice: it tests P, O, N, T in positions 1,2,4,5, and we know position 3 is I.

Similarly, ""THING"" tests T, H, N, G.

But ""POINT"" might be better because O and T are very common.

Another word: ""JOINT"" but J is rare.

""MOUNT"": M-O-U-N-T — but U is less common, and we have I at position 3? M-O-U-N-T has U at position 3, not I. We need I at position 3.

""POINT"" seems solid.

""BUILT"" has U, which is less common, but it's okay.

I think ""POINT"" is a standard word.

We could use ""BLIND"": B-L-I-N-D — but L and D are medium, and we avoid R,A,S,E.

But ""POINT"" has higher frequency letters.

Let's compare the frequency sum for the new letters:

For ""POINT"": P (2%), O (7.5%), N (7%), T (9%) — but we are testing positions 1,2,4,5. Position 3 is I, which we already know, so we don't get new info about I, but we use it to form the word.

The feedback will tell us about P, O, N, T.

Similarly for ""THING"": T (9%), H (6%), N (7%), G (2%) — T and N are high, H medium, G low.

""POINT"" has O and T high, N high, P low.

O is 7.5%, T 9%, N 7%, P 2% — average better than ""THING"" which has G at 2%.

""DOING"": D (4%), O (7.5%), N (7%), G (2%) — D and G lower.

So ""POINT"" seems best.

Another word: ""PRINT"" — but P-R-I-N-T, R is eliminated, we cannot use R. R is not in the word, so avoid.

Similarly, ""TRAIN"" has R and A, both eliminated.

So ""POINT"" is good.

""JOINT"" has J, which is very rare.

""QUINT"" has Q and U, Q is rare.

So I think ""POINT"" is a reasonable choice.

Therefore, I'll go with ""POINT"" for the second guess.

Thought process: Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"", we know that the third letter is 'I' and that 'R', 'A', 'S', 'E' are not in the word. Therefore, the second guess must have 'I' in the third position and avoid using the letters R, A, S, E. The goal is to test new common letters to gather more information. After considering words like ""THING"", ""BUILT"", and ""DOING"", ""POINT"" was selected because it includes high-frequency letters O, N, T (and P) in distinct positions, maximizing the potential for useful feedback on letter presence and position.

<guess>POINT</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- The third letter is ""I"" and in the correct position (✓).
- The letters ""R"", ""A"", ""S"", and ""E"" are not in the word at all (x).

For the second guess:
- The word must have ""I"" as the third letter (position 3).
- It must avoid using the letters R, A, S, or E.
- To maximize information gain, I should prioritize common unused letters (e.g., T, O, N, L, C, H) and avoid repeating letters to test more possibilities.

After evaluating options:
- ""POINT"" fits the criteria: it has ""I"" in position 3, avoids R/A/S/E, and tests new high-frequency letters (T, O, N) and the less common P. This provides broad coverage to narrow down the word list effectively.

<guess>POINT</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(✓) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(✓) N(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:
- Guess 1: RAISE -> R(x), A(x), I(✓), S(x), E(x) → I is correct and in position 3; R, A, S, E not in word.
- Guess 2: POINT -> P(x), O(x), I(✓), N(x), T(x) → I is still ✓ in position 3 (which we knew), and P, O, N, T not in word.

So now we know:
- The third letter is I. No change.
- Additional letters not in the word: P, O, N, T (from POINT), plus R, A, S, E (from RAISE). So total absent letters: R, A, S, E, P, O, N, T.

Letters that could be in the word: from the alphabet, subtract the absent ones.

Absent: A, E, I? Wait, I is in the word, so I is present but we already know its position.

Known present: I (at position 3).

Absent: R, A, S, E, P, O, N, T.

Possible remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we need common English letters, so likely consonants and possibly U or Y as vowels.

Since no other letters have been confirmed present yet except I, we must consider that the word has other letters from the remaining pool.

The word pattern is _ _ I _ _ (5 letters, third is I).

We have used letters: from RAISE: R,A,I,S,E and POINT: P,O,I,N,T. I is repeated, but we knew that.

So letters tested and absent: A,E,P,O,N,T,R,S. That's 8 letters plus E which is already included? List: A, E, R, S, P, O, N, T.

Absent: A, E, R, S, P, O, N, T.

Possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I? I is already in and we know position, so for other positions, we need to guess from letters not absent, excluding I since it's fixed at position 3 but can be used elsewhere? No, I is fixed at position 3, but could it be elsewhere? The feedback only shows that position 3 is I, but it doesn't preclude other I's. For example, in ""CIVIC"", I can appear multiple times.

But in guess 1, we had I as ✓, but the other positions had E, which was absent, so E is not in the word, but I could be duplicate? Let's see the feedback.

For RAISE: I(✓) means the letter in position 3 is correct (I). The other positions: R(x) means R is not in the word at all, similarly A(x), S(x), E(x) mean A, S, E not in word. But it doesn't say anything about additional I's. Similarly for POINT, P(x), O(x), N(x), T(x) mean no P,O,N,T in word, and I(✓) confirms position 3 I.

But since position 3 is I, and no other I was guessed in positions 1,2,4,5, it doesn't tell us if there could be another I. For example, the word could have I at position 3 and say at position 1, but since we didn't guess I elsewhere, we don't know.

In RAISE, position 4 is S, which was absent, but if we had guessed a word with I in other positions, it might show -, but we haven't. So possibly, the word could have multiple I's.

But with only I confirmed, we need to guess words with other letters.

Now, from remaining letters: common ones are B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, U, W, Y.

Vowels: we have U and possibly Y as semi-vowel, but vowels in English are A,E,I,O,U – A,E,O are absent, so U is the only vowel left besides I? But Y can be vowel too.

So possible vowels: I, U, Y.

But I is fixed at position 3, so other positions should have consonants or U/Y.

Possible words: pattern _ _ I _ _

Letters to use from: B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. But J,Q,X,Z are low frequency, so focus on B,C,D,F,G,H,L,M,U,W,Y.

For this guess, we want to test more common letters to find which are present.

Common unused: L, H, D, U, C, M, etc.

So we should construct a word with I at position 3, using letters not eliminated.

For example:

- Words with L: e.g., ""GUIL D"" but D is possible, and we have to avoid absent letters. G,U,I,L,D – no A,E,R,S,P,O,N,T.

""GUILD"" is a word? Yes, GUILD.

Similarly, ""BUILD"" – B,U,I,L,D – same idea.

""CLIMB"" – C,L,I,M,B – and M is possible.

""FLICK"" – F,L,I,C,K – K possible.

""THICK"" but T and H: T is absent, so no, T cannot be used.

T is absent, from POINT feedback T(x), so avoid T.

Similarly O,N,P absent.

So letters to avoid: A,E,R,S,P,O,N,T.

Letters to use: B,C,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. High frequency: C, D, F, G, H, L, M.

Now, possible words:

With U: since it's a vowel, might be good to test.

e.g., ""QUICK"" but Q is uncommon, and we have U,I,C,K.

""BUILD"": B,U,I,L,D

""GUILT"" but T absent, so no.

""GUILD"" is good.

""FLUID"": F,L,U,I,D – avoids absent letters.

""CLUMP"" but P absent? P is absent, yes.

P absent, so cannot use P.

""JUICE"" but E absent? E is absent, so no.

""DUCHY"" – D,U,C,H,Y – all valid? D,U,C,H,Y not absent.

Y is possible.

Another word: ""LUCKY"" – L,U,C,K,Y – but position 3 must be I? Pattern must have I at position 3, so ""LUCKY"" is L-U-C-K-Y, no I, so not acceptable. Must have I at position 3.

So only words with I in the middle.

""QUILT"" but T absent, no.

""BUILD"": B(1), U(2), I(3), L(4), D(5) – BUILD is a word.

""GUILD"": G(1), U(2), I(3), L(4), D(5) – same as BUILD with G.

""FLUID"": F(1), L(2), U(3)? Wait no, FLUID is F-L-U-I-D, positions: 1-F, 2-L, 3-U? But we need I at position 3. F-L-U-I-D has U at position 3, I at position 4. We need position 3 to be I.

So must be ? ? I ? ?, so first two letters, then I, then last two.

So ""BUILD"" is B-U-I-L-D, so 1-B,2-U,3-I,4-L,5-D. Good.

""GUILD"" similarly G-U-I-L-D.

""CLINK"": C-L-I-N-K but N absent, N is eliminated, so cannot use N.

From POINT, N(x), so absent.

Similarly ""BLIMP"" has P, absent.

""CHILD"": C-H-I-L-D – avoids absent letters? H,L,C,D possible.

C-H-I-L-D: positions 1-C,2-H,3-I,4-L,5-D.

Similarly ""MILD"": M-I-L-D but I at position 2? M-I-L-D has only four positions? Must be five letters.

""MILKY"": M-I-L-K-Y, position 1-M,2-I, then 3-L, but we need position 3 to be I, not L. So it must be I at 3.

""CHILL"": C-H-I-L-L, but double L, repeats, reduces information.

Better to avoid repeats if possible.

""GRIMY"": G-R-I-M-Y but R absent, cannot use R.

R is absent.

""WHINY"": W-H-I-N-Y but N absent.

So possible options without repeats: ""BUILD"", ""GUILD"", ""CHILD"", ""FILMY"" (but FILMY has Y, meaning covered with film), F-I-L-M-Y? Positions: 1-F,2-I? Not 3-I.

We need position 3 to be I.

""CHILD"": C-H-I-L-D, perfect.

""FIELD"": F-I-E-L-D but E absent? E is absent, from RAISE, E(x), so cannot use E.

So ""FIELD"" invalid.

""YIELD"": Y-I-E-L-D, has E, absent.

No.

""GUILT"" has T, absent.

So back to ""BUILD"", ""GUILD"", ""CHILD"".

""CIVIC"": C-I-V-I-C, has I at position 2 and 4, but position 3 is V? Position: 1-C,2-I,3-V,4-I,5-C. Position 3 is V, not I. So not I at 3.

We must have I at position 3.

""VALID"": V-A-L-I-D but A absent, no.

So ""CHILD"": C,H,I,L,D – letters C,H,L,D possible.

""BUILD"": B,U,I,L,D

""GUILD"": G,U,I,L,D

""FLUID"": F-L-U-I-D, position 3 is U? F-L-U-I-D, so 1=F,2=L,3=U,4=I,5=D. Position 3 is U, not I. So only if position 3 is I.

What about ""QUIET""? Q-U-I-E-T, but E and T absent, no.

""QUILL"" double L, and position? Q-U-I-L-L, positions 1-Q,2-U,3-I,4-L,5-L. So it has I at 3.

But double L repeats.

Better to avoid if possible.

""SKIMP"" S absent? S is absent.

We have U for vowel or Y.

Another word: ""CLIMB"": C-L-I-M-B, that could work: C,L,I,M,B.

""MOLDY"" no I.

""CHIME"": C-H-I-M-E, E absent.

No.

""WHILE"" W-H-I-L-E, E absent.

So back to: ""CHILD"", ""BUILD"", ""GUILD"", or ""JUICE"" but E absent, not.

""BLUID""? Not a word.

Perhaps ""FLUID"" cannot because position 3 not I.

Unless it's spelled F-L-U-I-D, but L-U-I, position 3 U, not I.

Standard spelling, position varies.

Another word: ""BRICK"" B-R-I-C-K, but R absent.

R is gone.

""PRICK"" P and R absent.

""THICK"" T absent.

So available: ""CHILD"" seems good: C-H-I-L-D.

""CHILL"" double L.

""GUIDE"" G-U-I-D-E, E absent.

""QUICK"" Q-U-I-C-K, that is Q-U-I-C-K, positions 1-Q,2-U,3-I,4-C,5-K. So it has I at 3.

Similarly, ""QUACK"" no I.

So ""QUICK"" is an option, but Q is uncommon, so might not be the secret word, but it could be.

But we want to test common letters.

""QUICK"": Q,U,I,C,K – letters Q,U,C,K.

Q and K are less common, U and C medium.

Compared to ""CHILD"": C,H,L,D – C,H,L,D more common than Q,U,C,K? C is in both, H,L,D vs U,K,Q.

H is 6%, L 4%, D 4%, U 2.5%, K 1%, Q very low.

So ""CHILD"" tests H,L,D which are better than U,K,Q.

But ""QUICK"" tests U and C.

Since C is common, testing it might be good.

But let's see another option.

""BUILD"": B,U,I,L,D – B low frequency, U medium, L,D medium.

Similarly ""GUILD"": G,U,I,L,D – G low.

""CHILD"": C,H,I,L,D – C,H,L,D all medium frequency.

C:3%, H:6%, L:4%, D:4%.

Not bad.

""DWARF"" no I.

Perhaps ""CHIMY"" not a word.

I think ""CHILD"" or ""BUILD"" are fine.

Also, with U, we can use ""BUILD"" to test U.

U is the only vowel possibility left besides Y, so it might be important to test it.

In ""BUILD"", U is at position 2.

Similarly in ""CHILD"", H is at position 2.

Both are consonants? H is consonant, U is vowel.

Since we lack vowel information, testing U might be valuable.

For example, if U is present, we get more clues.

If not, we eliminate it.

Similarly for Y.

But Y is less common.

So perhaps ""BUILD"" to test U.

""GUILD"" same.

Or ""QUICK"", but Q is rare.

Let's decide.

Perhaps a word like ""LYMPH"" no I.

Another one: ""WIMPY"" W-I-M-P-Y, position 3 not I.

Not.

So between ""CHILD"" and ""BUILD"", I'll choose ""CHILD"" because it avoids U which might be less necessary, but U could be key.

Since A,E,O are absent, U might be in the word or not.

At this point, with few guesses left, we need to be efficient.

Perhaps list possible words.

The secret word has I at position 3, no R,A,S,E,P,O,N,T.

Possible words:

- With C: CHILD, CHINK? But N absent, CHINK has N which is absent? CHINK has N, but N absent.

From POINT, N(x), so N absent.

So CHILD is good.

FLUID not, position wrong.

GUILD good.

BLIND: B-L-I-N-D, N absent, no.

BUILD good.

CLIMB: C-L-I-M-B, good.

DUTCH: D-U-T-C-H, T absent.

Invalid.

LUCK: not 5 letters.

JUMBO: no I.

So shortlist:

- BUILD (B,U,I,L,D)

- GUILD (G,U,I,L,D)

- CHILD (C,H,I,L,D)

- CLIMB (C,L,I,M,B)

- JUICE? J,U,I,C,E but E absent.

Not.

QUICK (Q,U,I,C,K)

 But Q and K uncommon.

Other words like: PHYLC not a word.

MYTHIC not 5 letters.

So realistic: BUILD, GUILD, CHILD, CLIMB.

CLIMB has B, which is low freq, but possible.

To maximize new letters, let's see what each tests.

For example:
- BUILD: tests B,U,L,D
- GUILD: tests G,U,L,D
- CHILD: tests C,H,L,D
- CLIMB: tests C,L,M,B

All test L and one more consonant plus U or not.

In CHILD, H is tested, in BUILD U is tested.

Since U is a vowel possibility, it might be worth testing.

Moreover, U is more common than H? H: 6%, U: 2.5%, so H is more common, but U as vowel may be critical.

Perhaps ""FIC us"" not a word.

""BLUID"" not standard.

I think both are fine.

Perhaps choose ""BUILD"" to check if U is present.

But let's set the strategy.

We have only one letter known, so we need to find the other four.

After this guess, we will get feedback.

So for this turn, guess one of these.

I'll go with ""CHILD"" for now.

But CHILD has H and L, etc.

Another word: ""MILCH"" M-I-L-C-H, position 2 I? Must be position 3 I.

Not.

""WICCA"" no I.

So I think ""CHILD"" is reasonable.

Or ""BLIMP"" but P absent.

No.

""GRIMY"" G-R-I-M-Y, R absent.

So CHILD it is.

But we can think of frequency.

Most common remaining letters: C, H, D, L, U, M, etc.

C has 3%, L 4%, H 6%, D 4%, U 2.5%, M 2.5%.

Average.

Perhaps ""CLIMB"" tests M.

But BUILD tests U.

Let's see if there is a word with multiple high frequency.

For example, ""CULLY"" but U and L I position? C-U-L-L-Y, position 3 L, not I.

Not.

""DILLY"" D-I-L-L-Y, position 2 I.

Not.

""GILLY"" similar.

I think ""CHILD"" or ""BUILD"" are the way to go.

I'll choose ""CHILD"" to test H and C.

So guess: CHILD

Thought process: Based on accumulated feedback:
- Position 3 is ""I"".
- Absent letters: R, A, S, E, P, O, N, T.
- The second guess ""POINT"" ruled out P, O, N, T aside from confirming position 3.
For the third guess, we need a 5-letter word with ""I"" at position 3, using only untested letters from the remaining pool (B,C,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,U,W,Y,Z). Priority is to test common consonants like C, L, H, D and vowel U.
After considering options such as ""BUILD"", ""GUILD"", ""CLIMB"", and ""QUICK"", ""CHILD"" is selected because it contains high-utility letters C, H, L, D (all distinct and reasonably common), avoiding rare letters and focusing on likely consonants. If ""CHILD"" is incorrect, the feedback willprovide new presence/absence information for C, H, L, D and their positions.

<guess>CHILD</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- Guess 1 ""RAISE"": I is correct and in position 3; R, A, S, E are absent.
- Guess 2 ""POINT"": I is still correct in position 3; P, O, N, T are absent.
- Total absent letters: A, E, R, S, P, O, N, T.  
- Position 3 is confirmed as ""I"".  
- Available letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, W, Y (common English letters from remaining pool).  

For the third guess:  
- Must have ""I"" in position 3 (pattern: _ _ I _ _).  
- Avoid all absent letters.  
- Prioritize testing high-frequency unused letters like C, L, H, D, U to maximize information gain.  
- Words evaluated:  
  - ""BUILD"" (tests B, U, L, D) – good for U (vowel test), but U less common.  
  - ""GUILD"" (tests G, U, L, D) – similar, G low frequency.  
  - ""CLIMB"" (tests C, L, M, B) – adds M but weak vowel coverage.  
  - ""CHILD"" (tests C, H, L, D) – optimal: C, H, L, D are high-value consonant tests; all letters distinct and moderate frequency.  

**Selected ""CHILD""**: Tests C, H, L, D—common letters not yet examined—and uses position 3 ""I"". Feedback will reveal new presences/absences and positions (especially for H, a frequent consonant, and potential vowel substitutes like Y).

Since I have no prior information, I should choose a word that maximizes the information I can gain about the secret word. The best strategy is to use a word with common letters that cover multiple possibilities.\n\nI recall that in games like Wordle, a good starting word often uses common vowels and consonants to cover a broad range of letters. This helps in narrowing down the possibilities based on the feedback.\n\nCommon vowels in English are A, E, I, O, U. Common consonants include S, T, N, R, H, L, D, etc.\n\nA popular starting word is ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" because they include frequent letters. Another one is ""ADIEU"", which has many vowels, but since there are only five positions, I need a balance of vowels and consonants.\n\nI should aim for a word with at least two vowels and three consonants to get a good spread.\n\nLet me think of some options:\n\n- ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E – includes common letters S, T, E, A.\n\n- ""CRANE"": C, R, A, N, E – similar, with R, A, N, E.\n\n- ""ROATE"": R, O, A, T, E – which is a less common word but has good coverage.\n\nI need to ensure the word is valid. ""ROATE"" might not be universally recognized; it\'s better to choose a common word.\n\n""ARISE"" is another good one: A, R, I, S, E – covers vowels A, I, E and consonants R, S.\n\nOr ""IRATE"": I, R, A, T, E.\n\nFrom feedback perspective, having distinct letters is important so that I can get clear information. If there are repeating letters, it might complicate the feedback, especially for the first guess. So, I should avoid words with duplicate letters.\n\nFor example, ""BOOKS"" has repeated O and S, so not ideal. Or ""SPOON"" with double O.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll avoid repeats.\n\nSuggested words without repeats: ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ADIEU"" (but A and E are vowels, D and U, U is less common), ""STERN"", ""PAINT"", etc.\n\n""ADIEU"" might be good for vowels, but consonants are D, which is medium frequency.\n\nIn terms of letter frequency in English words, here\'s a rough order: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, etc.\n\nSo, a word like ""STARE"" – S, T, A, R, E – covers S, T, A, R, E, all high frequency letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""CARES"" or ""SLANT"".\n\n""RESIN"": R, E, S, I, N – has R, E, S, I, N.\n\nI think ""STARE"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut let\'s confirm if it\'s valid. Yes, ""stare"" is a common English word.\n\n""RAISE"" is similar: R, A, I, S, E.\n\nEither is fine.\n\nI\'ll go with ""RAISE"" for my first guess because it has R, A, I, S, E – four vowels? A, I, E are vowels, R and S are consonants. Vowels: A, I, E; consonants: R, S.\n\nIn five letters: positions: 1-R, 2-A, 3-I, 4-S, 5-E.\n\nYes.\n\nI could use ""CRATE"" or ""SLATE"", but ""RAISE"" seems good.\n\nAnother popular one is ""OUIJA"" but that\'s not as common and has U, which might not be optimal.\n\nI think ""RAISE"" or ""SLATE"" are standard.\n\nLet me choose ""RAISE"" for now.\n\nBut the goal is to maximize entropy, meaning that after the guess, the feedback should help reduce the possible word set as much as possible.\n\nBased on studies, words like ""SOARE"" or ""ROATE"" are often recommended, but they are obscure. Better to stick with common words.\n\n""ARISE"" is essentially the same as ""RAISE"", just different starting letter.\n\nI\'ll use ""ARISE"": A, R, I, S, E.\n\nSame letters.\n\nPerhaps ""STEAM"": S, T, E, A, M – includes M, which is medium frequency.\n\nBut ""ARISE"" has higher frequency letters.\n\nE is the most common, then A, R, I, S are all top 10 or so.\n\nLetter frequencies: E is about 12%, T 9%, A 8%, O 7.5%, I 7%, N 7%, S 6.5%, H 6%, R 6%, D 4%, L 4%, etc.\n\n""ARISE"" has A, R, I, S, E – A:8%, R:6%, I:7%, S:6.5%, E:12%. Good coverage.\n\n""SLATE"" has S:6.5%, L:4%, A:8%, T:9%, E:12% – similar, with T instead of I, and L vs R.\n\nT is more common than R or I? T 9% vs R 6%, I 7%, so T is higher.\n\n""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E – L is less common at 4%, while R is 6%. So ""CRATE"" might be better: C: 3%, R:6%, A:8%, T:9%, E:12% – C is lower frequency.\n\nHow about ""TRACE"": T, R, A, C, E – again, C is low.\n\n""STARE"": S, T, A, R, E – S:6.5%, T:9%, A:8%, R:6%, E:12%. All solid.\n\nI think ""STARE"" is slightly better because of higher T frequency.\n\nSimilarly, ""CRANE"" has N instead of T; N is 7%.\n\nBut T is 9%, so ""STARE"" or ""SLATE"".\n\n""SLATE"" has L at 4%, while ""STARE"" has R at 6%, so ""STARE"" has a slightly better average frequency.\n\nI can go with ""STARE"".\n\nBut ""RAISE"" has I at 7% vs L in ""SLATE"" at 4%, so ""RAISE"" might be comparable.\n\nNo real difference; I\'ll pick one.\n\nFor consistency, I\'ll choose ""CRANE"" as it\'s often used, but let\'s decide.\n\nSince I need to output the guess, I\'ll go with ""ARISE"".\n\nBut in the system prompt, it used ""STORM"" as an example, so any valid word is fine.\n\nI think ""ARISE"" is good.\n\nLet me make a choice.\n\nI\'ll use ""SALET"" which is a word, but not common; ""salet"" is historical, may not be known. Better avoid.\n\n""ALERT"" is good: A, L, E, R, T.\n\nBut I think ""ARISE"" is fine.\n\nTo save time, I\'ll go with ""RAISE"".\n\nFinal decision: ""RAISE""\n\nSo for the response, I need to think step by step, then output the guess.\n\nThought process: As this is the first guess with no prior information, I should select a word that contains common letters to maximize the likelihood of getting feedback on frequent vowels and consonants. This helps in narrowing down the possible word list for subsequent guesses. After considering options like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", and ""STARE"", I choose ""RAISE"" as it includes high-frequency letters such as R, A, I, S, and E without any repeats.\n\nThen output in the format.Since this is the first guess, there is no prior feedback to consider. The goal is to choose a starting word that maximizes information gain by including high-frequency letters (vowels and consonants) to narrow down possibilities quickly. After evaluating common options:\n- Vowels like A, E, I are frequent and help identify core word structure.\n- Consonants like R, S are also common and versatile.\nWords like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""STARE"" are often effective, but ""RAISE"" was selected for its balance:\n  - It contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two consonants (R, S), with all letters distinct to avoid ambiguity.\n  - Letter frequencies: R (approx. 6%), A (8%), I (7%), S (6.5%), E (12%) cover a broad range of common English letters.\nThis choice increases the chance of getting useful position or presence feedback to inform later guesses.\n\n<guess>RAISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(✓) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: x (not in the word)\n- I: ✓ (correct position, so the third letter is I)\n- S: x (not in the word)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nSo, from this, we know:\n- The third letter is I.\n- The letters R, A, S, E are not in the word at all.\n- Therefore, the secret word has I as the third letter, and does not contain R, A, S, E.\n\nNow, we need to make a second guess. The guess must be a 5-letter word with I in the third position, and it should avoid using R, A, S, E.\n\nWe also want to use this guess to test other common letters to gather more information.\n\nSince I is fixed at position 3, we have to form a word with the pattern _ _ I _ _\n\nWe should choose letters that are common and not yet tested. From the first guess, we have eliminated R, A, S, E. So we have to avoid these.\n\nCommon letters left: T, O, N, H, L, D, C, U, M, P, etc.\n\nWe should aim to include as many new, common letters as possible in the guess.\n\nPossible words that fit the pattern _ _ I _ _ and don\'t use R, A, S, E:\n\nLet\'s think of some words:\n- With T: e.g., ""POINT"" (P, O, I, N, T) — but we have to check if it avoids R,A,S,E. P, O, I, N, T — yes, none of R,A,S,E.\n- ""BUILT"" (B, U, I, L, T) — avoids R,A,S,E.\n- ""GUILD"" (G, U, I, L, D) — avoids R,A,S,E.\n- ""CHILL"" (C, H, I, L, L) — but has double L, which might not be ideal because it reduces the number of distinct letters. Better to avoid repeats if possible to get more information.\n- ""THING"" (T, H, I, N, G) — avoids R,A,S,E.\n\nWe want to maximize the number of new letters tested.\n\nLetters we haven\'t used: from the first guess we used R,A,I,S,E. So we have I already known, but we are testing other positions.\n\nIn the second guess, we can test T, O, N, H, L, D, C, U, M, P, etc.\n\nLet\'s list the frequency: T (9%), O (7.5%), N (7%), H (6%), L (4%), D (4%), C (3%), U (2.5%), M (2.5%), P (2%), etc.\n\nSo, high frequency: T, O, N, H.\n\nWe should try to include T, O, N, H if possible.\n\nWord with I in the middle and including T, O, N, H.\n\nFor example:\n- ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T — includes O, N, T (and P). P is less common, but O, N, T are good.\n- ""THINK"": T, H, I, N, K — includes T, H, N, K. K is less common, but T, H, N are good.\n- ""LIGHT"": L, I, G, H, T — but I is at position 2, not 3. We need I at position 3.\n- ""NIGHT"": N, I, G, H, T — I is at position 2? N-I-G-H-T, so positions: 1-N, 2-I, 3-G, 4-H, 5-T. But we need I at position 3, so that\'s not it.\n\nWe need the third letter to be I, so pattern: ? ? I ? ?\n\nSo for ""NIGHT"", it\'s N-I-G-H-T, so I is at position 2, not 3.\n\nSimilarly, ""POINT"": P-O-I-N-T, so positions: 1-P, 2-O, 3-I, 4-N, 5-T. Perfect.\n\n""BUILT"": B-U-I-L-T, so 1-B, 2-U, 3-I, 4-L, 5-T.\n\n""GUILD"": G-U-I-L-D, 1-G, 2-U, 3-I, 4-L, 5-D.\n\n""CHILL"": C-H-I-L-L, 1-C, 2-H, 3-I, 4-L, 5-L — but double L, so not ideal.\n\n""THING"": T-H-I-N-G, 1-T, 2-H, 3-I, 4-N, 5-G.\n\n""DOING"": D-O-I-N-G, 1-D, 2-O, 3-I, 4-N, 5-G.\n\n""GOING"": G-O-I-N-G, but has double G? G-O-I-N-G, so 1-G, 2-O, 3-I, 4-N, 5-G — G is repeated, so not good for information.\n\n""JOINT"": J-O-I-N-T — J is rare.\n\n""MOIST"": M-O-I-S-T — but S is eliminated, we cannot use S because S is not in the word (from feedback, S is x, meaning not in word). So we must avoid S.\n\nSimilarly, we must avoid R, A, E as well.\n\nSo ""MOIST"" has S, which is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""POINT"" is good: P-O-I-N-T, no R,A,S,E.\n\n""BUILT"": B-U-I-L-T, no R,A,S,E.\n\n""THING"": T-H-I-N-G, no R,A,S,E.\n\n""DOING"": D-O-I-N-G, no R,A,S,E.\n\n""FLING"": F-L-I-N-G, no R,A,S,E.\n\n""CLING"": C-L-I-N-G, etc.\n\nNow, among these, which one has the most common letters? ""POINT"" has O, N, T which are high frequency. P is less common, but it\'s acceptable.\n\n""THING"" has T, H, N, G — H and N are good, G is medium.\n\n""DOING"" has O, N, G — O and N are high.\n\nBut ""POINT"" has O, N, T — T is the most common consonant.\n\nWe also want to cover different letters to test more.\n\nSince we know I is in the word and at position 3, we don\'t need to test I again, but we can use it to form the word.\n\nIn the feedback, for the second guess, we will get information about the other positions.\n\nI think ""POINT"" is a good choice: it tests P, O, N, T in positions 1,2,4,5, and we know position 3 is I.\n\nSimilarly, ""THING"" tests T, H, N, G.\n\nBut ""POINT"" might be better because O and T are very common.\n\nAnother word: ""JOINT"" but J is rare.\n\n""MOUNT"": M-O-U-N-T — but U is less common, and we have I at position 3? M-O-U-N-T has U at position 3, not I. We need I at position 3.\n\n""POINT"" seems solid.\n\n""BUILT"" has U, which is less common, but it\'s okay.\n\nI think ""POINT"" is a standard word.\n\nWe could use ""BLIND"": B-L-I-N-D — but L and D are medium, and we avoid R,A,S,E.\n\nBut ""POINT"" has higher frequency letters.\n\nLet\'s compare the frequency sum for the new letters:\n\nFor ""POINT"": P (2%), O (7.5%), N (7%), T (9%) — but we are testing positions 1,2,4,5. Position 3 is I, which we already know, so we don\'t get new info about I, but we use it to form the word.\n\nThe feedback will tell us about P, O, N, T.\n\nSimilarly for ""THING"": T (9%), H (6%), N (7%), G (2%) — T and N are high, H medium, G low.\n\n""POINT"" has O and T high, N high, P low.\n\nO is 7.5%, T 9%, N 7%, P 2% — average better than ""THING"" which has G at 2%.\n\n""DOING"": D (4%), O (7.5%), N (7%), G (2%) — D and G lower.\n\nSo ""POINT"" seems best.\n\nAnother word: ""PRINT"" — but P-R-I-N-T, R is eliminated, we cannot use R. R is not in the word, so avoid.\n\nSimilarly, ""TRAIN"" has R and A, both eliminated.\n\nSo ""POINT"" is good.\n\n""JOINT"" has J, which is very rare.\n\n""QUINT"" has Q and U, Q is rare.\n\nSo I think ""POINT"" is a reasonable choice.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""POINT"" for the second guess.\n\nThought process: Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"", we know that the third letter is \'I\' and that \'R\', \'A\', \'S\', \'E\' are not in the word. Therefore, the second guess must have \'I\' in the third position and avoid using the letters R, A, S, E. The goal is to test new common letters to gather more information. After considering words like ""THING"", ""BUILT"", and ""DOING"", ""POINT"" was selected because it includes high-frequency letters O, N, T (and P) in distinct positions, maximizing the potential for useful feedback on letter presence and position.\n\n<guess>POINT</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- The third letter is ""I"" and in the correct position (✓).\n- The letters ""R"", ""A"", ""S"", and ""E"" are not in the word at all (x).\n\nFor the second guess:\n- The word must have ""I"" as the third letter (position 3).\n- It must avoid using the letters R, A, S, or E.\n- To maximize information gain, I should prioritize common unused letters (e.g., T, O, N, L, C, H) and avoid repeating letters to test more possibilities.\n\nAfter evaluating options:\n- ""POINT"" fits the criteria: it has ""I"" in position 3, avoids R/A/S/E, and tests new high-frequency letters (T, O, N) and the less common P. This provides broad coverage to narrow down the word list effectively.\n\n<guess>POINT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(✓) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(✓) N(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n- Guess 1: RAISE -> R(x), A(x), I(✓), S(x), E(x) → I is correct and in position 3; R, A, S, E not in word.\n- Guess 2: POINT -> P(x), O(x), I(✓), N(x), T(x) → I is still ✓ in position 3 (which we knew), and P, O, N, T not in word.\n\nSo now we know:\n- The third letter is I. No change.\n- Additional letters not in the word: P, O, N, T (from POINT), plus R, A, S, E (from RAISE). So total absent letters: R, A, S, E, P, O, N, T.\n\nLetters that could be in the word: from the alphabet, subtract the absent ones.\n\nAbsent: A, E, I? Wait, I is in the word, so I is present but we already know its position.\n\nKnown present: I (at position 3).\n\nAbsent: R, A, S, E, P, O, N, T.\n\nPossible remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we need common English letters, so likely consonants and possibly U or Y as vowels.\n\nSince no other letters have been confirmed present yet except I, we must consider that the word has other letters from the remaining pool.\n\nThe word pattern is _ _ I _ _ (5 letters, third is I).\n\nWe have used letters: from RAISE: R,A,I,S,E and POINT: P,O,I,N,T. I is repeated, but we knew that.\n\nSo letters tested and absent: A,E,P,O,N,T,R,S. That\'s 8 letters plus E which is already included? List: A, E, R, S, P, O, N, T.\n\nAbsent: A, E, R, S, P, O, N, T.\n\nPossible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I? I is already in and we know position, so for other positions, we need to guess from letters not absent, excluding I since it\'s fixed at position 3 but can be used elsewhere? No, I is fixed at position 3, but could it be elsewhere? The feedback only shows that position 3 is I, but it doesn\'t preclude other I\'s. For example, in ""CIVIC"", I can appear multiple times.\n\nBut in guess 1, we had I as ✓, but the other positions had E, which was absent, so E is not in the word, but I could be duplicate? Let\'s see the feedback.\n\nFor RAISE: I(✓) means the letter in position 3 is correct (I). The other positions: R(x) means R is not in the word at all, similarly A(x), S(x), E(x) mean A, S, E not in word. But it doesn\'t say anything about additional I\'s. Similarly for POINT, P(x), O(x), N(x), T(x) mean no P,O,N,T in word, and I(✓) confirms position 3 I.\n\nBut since position 3 is I, and no other I was guessed in positions 1,2,4,5, it doesn\'t tell us if there could be another I. For example, the word could have I at position 3 and say at position 1, but since we didn\'t guess I elsewhere, we don\'t know.\n\nIn RAISE, position 4 is S, which was absent, but if we had guessed a word with I in other positions, it might show -, but we haven\'t. So possibly, the word could have multiple I\'s.\n\nBut with only I confirmed, we need to guess words with other letters.\n\nNow, from remaining letters: common ones are B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, U, W, Y.\n\nVowels: we have U and possibly Y as semi-vowel, but vowels in English are A,E,I,O,U – A,E,O are absent, so U is the only vowel left besides I? But Y can be vowel too.\n\nSo possible vowels: I, U, Y.\n\nBut I is fixed at position 3, so other positions should have consonants or U/Y.\n\nPossible words: pattern _ _ I _ _\n\nLetters to use from: B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. But J,Q,X,Z are low frequency, so focus on B,C,D,F,G,H,L,M,U,W,Y.\n\nFor this guess, we want to test more common letters to find which are present.\n\nCommon unused: L, H, D, U, C, M, etc.\n\nSo we should construct a word with I at position 3, using letters not eliminated.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Words with L: e.g., ""GUIL D"" but D is possible, and we have to avoid absent letters. G,U,I,L,D – no A,E,R,S,P,O,N,T.\n\n""GUILD"" is a word? Yes, GUILD.\n\nSimilarly, ""BUILD"" – B,U,I,L,D – same idea.\n\n""CLIMB"" – C,L,I,M,B – and M is possible.\n\n""FLICK"" – F,L,I,C,K – K possible.\n\n""THICK"" but T and H: T is absent, so no, T cannot be used.\n\nT is absent, from POINT feedback T(x), so avoid T.\n\nSimilarly O,N,P absent.\n\nSo letters to avoid: A,E,R,S,P,O,N,T.\n\nLetters to use: B,C,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. High frequency: C, D, F, G, H, L, M.\n\nNow, possible words:\n\nWith U: since it\'s a vowel, might be good to test.\n\ne.g., ""QUICK"" but Q is uncommon, and we have U,I,C,K.\n\n""BUILD"": B,U,I,L,D\n\n""GUILT"" but T absent, so no.\n\n""GUILD"" is good.\n\n""FLUID"": F,L,U,I,D – avoids absent letters.\n\n""CLUMP"" but P absent? P is absent, yes.\n\nP absent, so cannot use P.\n\n""JUICE"" but E absent? E is absent, so no.\n\n""DUCHY"" – D,U,C,H,Y – all valid? D,U,C,H,Y not absent.\n\nY is possible.\n\nAnother word: ""LUCKY"" – L,U,C,K,Y – but position 3 must be I? Pattern must have I at position 3, so ""LUCKY"" is L-U-C-K-Y, no I, so not acceptable. Must have I at position 3.\n\nSo only words with I in the middle.\n\n""QUILT"" but T absent, no.\n\n""BUILD"": B(1), U(2), I(3), L(4), D(5) – BUILD is a word.\n\n""GUILD"": G(1), U(2), I(3), L(4), D(5) – same as BUILD with G.\n\n""FLUID"": F(1), L(2), U(3)? Wait no, FLUID is F-L-U-I-D, positions: 1-F, 2-L, 3-U? But we need I at position 3. F-L-U-I-D has U at position 3, I at position 4. We need position 3 to be I.\n\nSo must be ? ? I ? ?, so first two letters, then I, then last two.\n\nSo ""BUILD"" is B-U-I-L-D, so 1-B,2-U,3-I,4-L,5-D. Good.\n\n""GUILD"" similarly G-U-I-L-D.\n\n""CLINK"": C-L-I-N-K but N absent, N is eliminated, so cannot use N.\n\nFrom POINT, N(x), so absent.\n\nSimilarly ""BLIMP"" has P, absent.\n\n""CHILD"": C-H-I-L-D – avoids absent letters? H,L,C,D possible.\n\nC-H-I-L-D: positions 1-C,2-H,3-I,4-L,5-D.\n\nSimilarly ""MILD"": M-I-L-D but I at position 2? M-I-L-D has only four positions?

C is in both, H,L,D vs U,K,Q.\n\nH is 6%, L 4%, D 4%, U 2.5%, K 1%, Q very low.\n\nSo ""CHILD"" tests H,L,D which are better than U,K,Q.\n\nBut ""QUICK"" tests U and C.\n\nSince C is common, testing it might be good.\n\nBut let\'s see another option.\n\n""BUILD"": B,U,I,L,D – B low frequency, U medium, L,D medium.\n\nSimilarly ""GUILD"": G,U,I,L,D – G low.\n\n""CHILD"": C,H,I,L,D – C,H,L,D all medium frequency.\n\nC:3%, H:6%, L:4%, D:4%.\n\nNot bad.\n\n""DWARF"" no I.\n\nPerhaps ""CHIMY"" not a word.\n\nI think ""CHILD"" or ""BUILD"" are fine.\n\nAlso, with U, we can use ""BUILD"" to test U.\n\nU is the only vowel possibility left besides Y, so it might be important to test it.\n\nIn ""BUILD"", U is at position 2.\n\nSimilarly in ""CHILD"", H is at position 2.\n\nBoth are consonants? H is consonant, U is vowel.\n\nSince we lack vowel information, testing U might be valuable.\n\nFor example, if U is present, we get more clues.\n\nIf not, we eliminate it.\n\nSimilarly for Y.\n\nBut Y is less common.\n\nSo perhaps ""BUILD"" to test U.\n\n""GUILD"" same.\n\nOr ""QUICK"", but Q is rare.\n\nLet\'s decide.\n\nPerhaps a word like ""LYMPH"" no I.\n\nAnother one: ""WIMPY"" W-I-M-P-Y, position 3 not I.\n\nNot.\n\nSo between ""CHILD"" and ""BUILD"", I\'ll choose ""CHILD"" because it avoids U which might be less necessary, but U could be key.\n\nSince A,E,O are absent, U might be in the word or not.\n\nAt this point, with few guesses left, we need to be efficient.\n\nPerhaps list possible words.\n\nThe secret word has I at position 3, no R,A,S,E,P,O,N,T.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- With C: CHILD, CHINK?

H: 6%, U: 2.5%, so H is more common, but U as vowel may be critical.\n\nPerhaps ""FIC us"" not a word.\n\n""BLUID"" not standard.\n\nI think both are fine.\n\nPerhaps choose ""BUILD"" to check if U is present.\n\nBut let\'s set the strategy.\n\nWe have only one letter known, so we need to find the other four.\n\nAfter this guess, we will get feedback.\n\nSo for this turn, guess one of these.\n\nI\'ll go with ""CHILD"" for now.\n\nBut CHILD has H and L, etc.\n\nAnother word: ""MILCH"" M-I-L-C-H, position 2 I?

Priority is to test common consonants like C, L, H, D and vowel U.\nAfter considering options such as ""BUILD"", ""GUILD"", ""CLIMB"", and ""QUICK"", ""CHILD"" is selected because it contains high-utility letters C, H, L, D (all distinct and reasonably common), avoiding rare letters and focusing on likely consonants.

We have feedback from the third guess ""CHILD"":
- C(-): C is in the word but in the wrong position
- H(x): H is not in the word
- I(✓): I is correct and in position 3 (already known)
- L(x): L is not in the word
- D(x): D is not in the word

From previous guesses:
- Position 3 is I.
- Absent letters: A, E, R, S, P, O, N, T, H, L, D. From all feedback:
  - RAISE: R(x), A(x), S(x), E(x) → absent
  - POINT: P(x), O(x), N(x), T(x) → absent
  - CHILD: H(x), L(x), D(x) → absent, and C(-) means C is present but not at position 1.

So now, absent letters: A, E, R, S, P, O, N, T, H, L, D.

Present letters:
- I is in position 3.
- C is in the word, but not at position 1. Since it gave (-) for position 1, and other positions we don't know yet.

C could be in position 2, 4, or 5.

Pattern is _ _ I _ _

Also, since H, L, D are absent, and from CHILD, we have positions:
1: C which is wrong position (so C not in pos 1), but C is somewhere else.

Now, we know C is present, but not at pos 1, and possibly not at pos 3 since that is I, but C and I are different letters, so C cannot be at pos 3.

Positions: 1: C (wrong position), 2: H (absent), 3: I (correct), 4: L (absent), 5: D (absent).

So C must be in position 2, 4, or 5? No, the word has other positions.

The secret word has C in it, but not at position 1, and possibly at position 2,4, or 5.

But in CHILD, position 2 was H, which is absent, so not C there? Not necessarily, because C could be in position 2, but we guessed H at pos 2, so if C were at pos 2, it would have shown differently.

In CHILD, we guessed:
Pos1: C → feedback (-) meaning C is in word but not here. So C is not at position 1.
Pos2: H → feedback (x) meaning H not in word at all.
Pos3: I → (✓) correct.
Pos4: L → (x) L not in word.
Pos5: D → (x) D not in word.

So C is in the word, but since the feedback for pos1 is (-), C must be in one of the other positions: 2,4, or 5.

But position 2: we guessed H, not C, so if C were at position 2, the feedback for position 2 would be (-) or (✓), but since we guessed H and H is absent, it's (x), so nothing about C being at pos 2. Similarly for other positions.

C could be at position 2,4, or 5.

For example, if C is at position 2, but we didn't guess C at position 2; we guessed H, which was wrong. So the feedback doesn't tell us which other position C is at.

We need to guess a word that has C at possible positions and I at position 3, and avoids absent letters.

Absent letters: A,E,R,S,P,O,N,T,H,L,D.

So remaining possible letters: B,F,G,J,K,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. And from previous, C is present, I is present at pos 3.

C must be in the word, so in positions 2,4, or 5.

Also, possible vowels: only U or Y, since A,E,I,O absent? I is present, O absent, A,E absent.

Vowel possibilities: U, or sometimes Y.

But I is already in.

So for other positions, we need to use letters from remaining.

Possible words with C in the word at different positions and I at position 3.

First, list letters to use: available letters include B,F,G,J,K,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z, and C is for sure.

But C must be placed.

Now, common letters left: F,G,K,M,U,W,Y.

Low frequency: J,Q,V,X,Z.

Avoid repeats if possible.

Pattern: ? ? I ? ?

C must be in position 2,4, or 5.

So cases:

- If C is position 2: pattern _ C I _ _
- If C is position 4: pattern _ _ I C _
- If C is position 5: pattern _ _ I _ C

We need to guess a word that fits one of these and uses other new letters to test.

For example, if C is at position 4, word like _ _ I C _

But what words?

Similarly for other positions.

Since we don't know where C is, we need to guess a word that covers multiple possibilities.

But with the constraints, few words exist.

Moreover, we have to avoid absent letters.

Possible words with I at position 3 and C somewhere else.

For example:

- If C at position 2: pattern _ C I _ _
  Example words: ""UCIFI"" not word, ""ACID"" but A absent, no. Absent letters.
  Available: so position 1: must be letter not absent, like F,G,U,K,etc.
  And position 4 and 5.
  So possible "" F C I K "" with K not good.
  "" F C I E D "" E absent.
  Hard to find.
  "" U C I K Y "" not word.

I am considering real words.

Shortlist possible words given constraints.

Remember, the word must be valid English 5-letter word.

With I at position 3, C in the word not at position 1, and absent letters avoided.

Possible positions for C:

First, C could be at position 4: e.g., words like ? ? I C ?

Position 4 C.

For example, ""MUSIC"" is M-U-S-I-C, but S isabsent and position 4 S? Wait, ""MUSIC"" positions:1-M,2-U,3-S,4-I? But we need position 3 to be I, here position 4 is I? Not.

Pattern must be position 3 I.

For position 4: C, pattern _ _ I C _

So letters 4: C.

Words ending with C? But rarely, except like ""MUSIC"" but wrong I position.

"" COMIC "" C-O-M-I-C but O absent and C not position 4? Positions:1-C,2-O,3-M,4-I,5-C — no, position 3 M not I.

If we have _ _ I C _, e.g., ""BICEP"" B-I-C-E-P but E and P absent, and I at position 2? B-I-C-E-P:1-B,2-I,3-C,4-E,5-P.

Not position 3 I.

We need first two letters, then I at 3, then C at 4, then last letter.

For example, word like ""CUBIC"" but C at start? ""CUBIC"" C-U-B-I-C, positions:1-C,2-U,3-B? Not I. Position 3 B.

Not.

""MEDIC"" M-E-D-I-C, E absent and positions:1-M,2-E,3-D,4-I,5-C — position 4 I, not 3.

Hard to find words with I at position 3 and C at position 4.

With C at position 5: pattern _ _ I _ C

Word ending with C and I at position 3.

For example, ""JUICY"" J-U-I-C-Y, positions:1-J,2-U,3-I,4-C,5-Y — yes, position 3 I, and position 4 C, position 5 Y.

Not C at position 5.

Position 5 C.

_JUICY has position 4 C or position 5 Y.

""TONIC"" T-O-N-I-C, T,O,N absent.

""MANIC"" M-A-N-I-C, A,N absent.

"" PANIC "" P-A-N-I-C, P,A,N absent.

""GENIC"" G-E-N-I-C, E,N absent.

""LYRIC"" L-Y-R-I-C, L absent? L is absent from CHILD L(x), so L absent. And R absent.

Not.

""MYCIC"" not word.

""CIVIC"" C-I-V-I-C, but position 3 V? C-I-V-I-C:1-C,2-I,3-V,4-I,5-C. Position 3 V not I.

So rare.

Now, other position, C at position 2: pattern _ C I _ _

For example, ""AC ID"" not, absent letters.
"" U C I F Y "" not word.
"" S C I F I "" not.

Similarly, ""ECLIPSE"" too many letters.

I think there are few options.

Perhaps C at position 4 or 5 is difficult.

Maybe C is at position 2.

For instance, ""UCK IN"" not word.

Another idea: words like ""CYKES"" not common.

Perhaps ""WHICH"" W-H-I-C-H, but H absent, and position 3 I, position 4 C? ""WHICH"" 1-W,2-H,3-I,4-C,5-H — H absent, so invalid.

But H is absent.

Similarly, "" PICKY "" P-I-C-K-Y, P absent and I at position 2? Not.

Position 3 I: ""  P I C K Y "" no.

We need position 3 I.

List all possible words from the remaining letters.

Available letters: B,F,G,J,K,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z and C must be in.

With pattern _ _ I _ _

And C in 2,4, or 5.

For example:
- Position 2 C: so word like X C I Y Z, where Y and Z are other letters.
  Position 1: say B, F, G, K, M, U, W, Y? But Y can be consonant.
  Position 4 and 5: similar.

Words: ""BCI"" not word.

""CIGAR"" C at start, but position wrong.

I think we have to accept that C might be at position 5 or 4.

Another common word: ""MUCKI"" not 5 letters.

""QUICK"" we thought earlier, but QUICK is Q-U-I-C-K, positions 1-Q,2-U,3-I,4-C,5-K.

So it has position 3 I, and C at position 4.

C is at position 4, and Q,U,K.

Q and K are available? Absent letters don't include Q,U,K.

From feedback, no Q,U,K eliminated yet.

Similarly, ""QUICK"" avoids absent letters: Q,U,C,K are all possible, and I at 3.

Also, U is a vowel candidate.

But Q is low frequency, but possible.

Feedback from CHILD: C(-) , which means C is in the word but not at position 1, and in QUICK, position 4 C, so U at position 2, etc.

Another word: ""CIVIC"" not position 3 I.

""JUICY"" is J-U-I-C-Y, which has position 3 I, position 4 C, position 5 Y.

Y possible.

""JUICY"" might work, J,U,C,Y.

C at position 4.

Or ""GUICY"" not word.

""BUICK"" not word.

So possible words: ""QUICK"", ""JUICY"", etc.

""QUICK"" is valid.

For C at position 5: ""  ... I .. C "" like ""VODIC"" not word, ""LOGIC"" L,O absent.

Not.

So probably ""QUICK"" or ""JUICY"".

""QUICK"" tests Q,U,C,K and C is already known present, but we can get positions.

Similarly, ""JUICY"" tests J,U,C,Y.

Both U and Y vowel possibilities.

Perhaps ""QUICK"" to test U.

We also have other letters to test.

But we have to guess a word.

Another option: since C is present and at position 2,4, or 5, we can guess a word with C in multiple positions or different.

For example, ""CUBIC"" has C at 1 and 5, position 3 not I.

Not.

"" C I V I C "" position 2 I not 3.

Not.

I think the most common is ""QUICK"".

Letters: Q,U,I,C,K.

Q and K uncommon, but U is valuable.

""BUICK"" not word.

Or ""CLICK"" but L absent, L eliminated.

L absent.

So no.

""KICKS"" K-I-C-K-S, S absent and position 2 I not.

Not.

So ""QUICK"" or similar.

"" CHICK"" C at position 1, but H absent, invalid.

H absent.

So ""QUICK"" seems viable.

""QUAFF"" no I.

So let's go with ""QUICK"".

But position of C is at position 4, which one possibility.

Feedback will give us positions.

Another word: ""JUICE"" but E absent, not.

""YICKS"" not.

So ""QUICK"" is a option.

""QUIFF"" Q-U-I-F-F, so position 3 I, position 4 F, position 5 F, double F.

Not great.

""QUIMS"" no.

So ""QUICK"" is better.

Perhaps ""UMIAC"" not common.

I think we have to choose ""QUICK"".

But let's think of the feedback.

If we guess ""QUICK"", positions:1-Q,2-U,3-I,4-C,5-K

Feedback will tell:
- Q: if correct or present
- U: similarly
- I: correct at position 3
- C: at position 4, which might be correct or wrong position
- K: etc.

But C is present, so if at position 4 is wrong, it must be elsewhere, but since we guess it at 4, if (✓) then good, if (-) then it is at other position.

Similarly for Q,U,K.

With only 3 guesses left, we can risk.

But another word: with U and Y.

For example, ""YUCCA"" Y-U-C-C-A, A absent and position not I.

No.

""MYCIN"" not word.

So I think ""QUICK"" or ""JUICY"".

""JUICY"": J,U,I,C,Y

J less common than Q? Q slightly more than J.

But similar.

Position 3 I, position 4 C, position 5 Y.

In feedback, for CHILD, C at position 1 was (-), so C is elsewhere, but not necessarily at position 4; it could be at position 2 or 5.

In ""JUICY"", if we guess, position 4 is C, so if C is at position 4, it would be (✓) or (-).

But if C is at position 5, for example, then guessing at position 4 might be (x) or (-), but since C is present, it would be (-) if wrong position.

Similarly.

To test if C is at position 2, we could guess a word with C at position 2.

Few examples: ""FCKED"" not a word.

""UCKER"" not.

""BCI"" not.

""MCGUI"" not.

I think it's hard, so perhaps assume C is not at position 2, position 2 could be U or something.

Another possible word: ""BUICK"" not, or ""QUILT"" T absent.

Not.

I think ""QUICK"" is the best choice.

Let's go with ""QUICK"".

But we need a word, so guess ""QUICK"".

Thought process for response:

From CHILD feedback, C is present but not at position 1, so it must be in one of positions 2, 4, or 5. However, positions 2 and 4 were guessed as H and L in CHILD, but H and L are absent, so C cannot be at position 2 or 4 because if it were, it would have been indicated in CHILD feedback? No, in CHILD, position 2 was H, not C, so if C is at position 2, the feedback for position 2 wouldn't show C because we didn't guess C there; we guessed H. So C could be at position 2, and we wouldn't know.

Similarly for position 4, we guessed L, not C.

Position 5 guessed D.

So C could be at position 2,4, or 5.

For example, if C is at position 2, the secret word has C there, but we guessed H, so it showed (x) for H.

Nothing about C at position 2.

Position position.

So C can be at position 2,4, or 5.

With that in mind, for the fourth guess, we want to guess a word that places C in a possible position and uses other letter to test.

""QUICK"" has C at position 4, so if C is at position 4, it will be (✓) or if not, (-) if elsewhere, or we will know.

Similarly, it also tests Q,U,K.

So I'll go with ""QUICK"".

Therefore, guess ""QUICK"".

In the response, include thought process.

Thought process: Based on feedback from ""CHILD"", C is present in the secret word but not at position 1. With positions 2, 4, and 5 being possibilities for C, and given the absence of 11 letters (A,E,H,L,D,R,S,P,O,N,T), the remaining letters include F,G,J,K,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. The guess must hI at position 3 and incorporate C somewhere else. Words like ""QUICK"" (Q,U,I,C,K) fit and test the vowel candidate U and consonant K. Although Q and K are uncommon, this guess efficiently checks if C is at position 4 and provides new informatU and K.

<guess>QUICK</guess>
</think>
Based on the accumulated feedback:
- Position 3 is confirmed as ""I"".
- C is present in the word but not at position 1 (feedback: C(-)).
- Absent letters: A, E, R, S, P, O, N, T, H, L, D (from all previous feedback).
- Remaining possible letters: B, F, G, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For the fourth guess:
- Must have ""I"" at position 3 (pattern: _ _ I _ _).
- Must include C (per feedback), but C cannot be at position 1. C could be at position 2, 4, or 5.
- Avoid all absent letters.
- Prioritize testing high-frequency unused letters like U (potential vowel), K, and M to maximize information gain.
- Evaluated words:
  - ""QUICK"": Tests Q, U, C at position 4, K. Covers U (critical vowel test) and positions for C. Downside: Q less common.
  - ""JUICY"": Tests J, U, C, Y. J/Y low frequency.
  - ""QUIFF"" or ""QUIMS"": Invalid due to double letters or absent S.
  - Other options sparse due to constraints.

""QUICK"" was selected to validate if C is at position 4 (high probability based on common word structures), test the vowel candidate U, and introduce K—a useful consonant. Feedback will clarify C position and U/K presence, reducing possibilities significantly.

<guess>QUICK</guess>",QUICK,"We have feedback from the third guess ""CHILD"":
- C(-): C is in the word but in the wrong position
- H(x): H is not in the word
- I(✓): I is correct and in position 3 (already known)
- L(x): L is not in the word
- D(x): D is not in the word

From previous guesses:
- Position 3 is I.
- Absent letters: A, E, R, S, P, O, N, T, H, L, D. From all feedback:
  - RAISE: R(x), A(x), S(x), E(x) → absent
  - POINT: P(x), O(x), N(x), T(x) → absent
  - CHILD: H(x), L(x), D(x) → absent, and C(-) means C is present but not at position 1.

So now, absent letters: A, E, R, S, P, O, N, T, H, L, D.

Present letters:
- I is in position 3.
- C is in the word, but not at position 1. Since it gave (-) for position 1, and other positions we don't know yet.

C could be in position 2, 4, or 5.

Pattern is _ _ I _ _

Also, since H, L, D are absent, and from CHILD, we have positions:
1: C which is wrong position (so C not in pos 1), but C is somewhere else.

Now, we know C is present, but not at pos 1, and possibly not at pos 3 since that is I, but C and I are different letters, so C cannot be at pos 3.

Positions: 1: C (wrong position), 2: H (absent), 3: I (correct), 4: L (absent), 5: D (absent).

So C must be in position 2, 4, or 5? No, the word has other positions.

The secret word has C in it, but not at position 1, and possibly at position 2,4, or 5.

But in CHILD, position 2 was H, which is absent, so not C there? Not necessarily, because C could be in position 2, but we guessed H at pos 2, so if C were at pos 2, it would have shown differently.

In CHILD, we guessed:
Pos1: C → feedback (-) meaning C is in word but not here. So C is not at position 1.
Pos2: H → feedback (x) meaning H not in word at all.
Pos3: I → (✓) correct.
Pos4: L → (x) L not in word.
Pos5: D → (x) D not in word.

So C is in the word, but since the feedback for pos1 is (-), C must be in one of the other positions: 2,4, or 5.

But position 2: we guessed H, not C, so if C were at position 2, the feedback for position 2 would be (-) or (✓), but since we guessed H and H is absent, it's (x), so nothing about C being at pos 2. Similarly for other positions.

C could be at position 2,4, or 5.

For example, if C is at position 2, but we didn't guess C at position 2; we guessed H, which was wrong. So the feedback doesn't tell us which other position C is at.

We need to guess a word that has C at possible positions and I at position 3, and avoids absent letters.

Absent letters: A,E,R,S,P,O,N,T,H,L,D.

So remaining possible letters: B,F,G,J,K,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. And from previous, C is present, I is present at pos 3.

C must be in the word, so in positions 2,4, or 5.

Also, possible vowels: only U or Y, since A,E,I,O absent? I is present, O absent, A,E absent.

Vowel possibilities: U, or sometimes Y.

But I is already in.

So for other positions, we need to use letters from remaining.

Possible words with C in the word at different positions and I at position 3.

First, list letters to use: available letters include B,F,G,J,K,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z, and C is for sure.

But C must be placed.

Now, common letters left: F,G,K,M,U,W,Y.

Low frequency: J,Q,V,X,Z.

Avoid repeats if possible.

Pattern: ? ? I ? ?

C must be in position 2,4, or 5.

So cases:

- If C is position 2: pattern _ C I _ _
- If C is position 4: pattern _ _ I C _
- If C is position 5: pattern _ _ I _ C

We need to guess a word that fits one of these and uses other new letters to test.

For example, if C is at position 4, word like _ _ I C _

But what words?

Similarly for other positions.

Since we don't know where C is, we need to guess a word that covers multiple possibilities.

But with the constraints, few words exist.

Moreover, we have to avoid absent letters.

Possible words with I at position 3 and C somewhere else.

For example:

- If C at position 2: pattern _ C I _ _
  Example words: ""UCIFI"" not word, ""ACID"" but A absent, no. Absent letters.
  Available: so position 1: must be letter not absent, like F,G,U,K,etc.
  And position 4 and 5.
  So possible "" F C I K "" with K not good.
  "" F C I E D "" E absent.
  Hard to find.
  "" U C I K Y "" not word.

I am considering real words.

Shortlist possible words given constraints.

Remember, the word must be valid English 5-letter word.

With I at position 3, C in the word not at position 1, and absent letters avoided.

Possible positions for C:

First, C could be at position 4: e.g., words like ? ? I C ?

Position 4 C.

For example, ""MUSIC"" is M-U-S-I-C, but S isabsent and position 4 S? Wait, ""MUSIC"" positions:1-M,2-U,3-S,4-I? But we need position 3 to be I, here position 4 is I? Not.

Pattern must be position 3 I.

For position 4: C, pattern _ _ I C _

So letters 4: C.

Words ending with C? But rarely, except like ""MUSIC"" but wrong I position.

"" COMIC "" C-O-M-I-C but O absent and C not position 4? Positions:1-C,2-O,3-M,4-I,5-C — no, position 3 M not I.

If we have _ _ I C _, e.g., ""BICEP"" B-I-C-E-P but E and P absent, and I at position 2? B-I-C-E-P:1-B,2-I,3-C,4-E,5-P.

Not position 3 I.

We need first two letters, then I at 3, then C at 4, then last letter.

For example, word like ""CUBIC"" but C at start? ""CUBIC"" C-U-B-I-C, positions:1-C,2-U,3-B? Not I. Position 3 B.

Not.

""MEDIC"" M-E-D-I-C, E absent and positions:1-M,2-E,3-D,4-I,5-C — position 4 I, not 3.

Hard to find words with I at position 3 and C at position 4.

With C at position 5: pattern _ _ I _ C

Word ending with C and I at position 3.

For example, ""JUICY"" J-U-I-C-Y, positions:1-J,2-U,3-I,4-C,5-Y — yes, position 3 I, and position 4 C, position 5 Y.

Not C at position 5.

Position 5 C.

_JUICY has position 4 C or position 5 Y.

""TONIC"" T-O-N-I-C, T,O,N absent.

""MANIC"" M-A-N-I-C, A,N absent.

"" PANIC "" P-A-N-I-C, P,A,N absent.

""GENIC"" G-E-N-I-C, E,N absent.

""LYRIC"" L-Y-R-I-C, L absent? L is absent from CHILD L(x), so L absent. And R absent.

Not.

""MYCIC"" not word.

""CIVIC"" C-I-V-I-C, but position 3 V? C-I-V-I-C:1-C,2-I,3-V,4-I,5-C. Position 3 V not I.

So rare.

Now, other position, C at position 2: pattern _ C I _ _

For example, ""AC ID"" not, absent letters.
"" U C I F Y "" not word.
"" S C I F I "" not.

Similarly, ""ECLIPSE"" too many letters.

I think there are few options.

Perhaps C at position 4 or 5 is difficult.

Maybe C is at position 2.

For instance, ""UCK IN"" not word.

Another idea: words like ""CYKES"" not common.

Perhaps ""WHICH"" W-H-I-C-H, but H absent, and position 3 I, position 4 C? ""WHICH"" 1-W,2-H,3-I,4-C,5-H — H absent, so invalid.

But H is absent.

Similarly, "" PICKY "" P-I-C-K-Y, P absent and I at position 2? Not.

Position 3 I: ""  P I C K Y "" no.

We need position 3 I.

List all possible words from the remaining letters.

Available letters: B,F,G,J,K,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z and C must be in.

With pattern _ _ I _ _

And C in 2,4, or 5.

For example:
- Position 2 C: so word like X C I Y Z, where Y and Z are other letters.
  Position 1: say B, F, G, K, M, U, W, Y? But Y can be consonant.
  Position 4 and 5: similar.

Words: ""BCI"" not word.

""CIGAR"" C at start, but position wrong.

I think we have to accept that C might be at position 5 or 4.

Another common word: ""MUCKI"" not 5 letters.

""QUICK"" we thought earlier, but QUICK is Q-U-I-C-K, positions 1-Q,2-U,3-I,4-C,5-K.

So it has position 3 I, and C at position 4.

C is at position 4, and Q,U,K.

Q and K are available? Absent letters don't include Q,U,K.

From feedback, no Q,U,K eliminated yet.

Similarly, ""QUICK"" avoids absent letters: Q,U,C,K are all possible, and I at 3.

Also, U is a vowel candidate.

But Q is low frequency, but possible.

Feedback from CHILD: C(-) , which means C is in the word but not at position 1, and in QUICK, position 4 C, so U at position 2, etc.

Another word: ""CIVIC"" not position 3 I.

""JUICY"" is J-U-I-C-Y, which has position 3 I, position 4 C, position 5 Y.

Y possible.

""JUICY"" might work, J,U,C,Y.

C at position 4.

Or ""GUICY"" not word.

""BUICK"" not word.

So possible words: ""QUICK"", ""JUICY"", etc.

""QUICK"" is valid.

For C at position 5: ""  ... I .. C "" like ""VODIC"" not word, ""LOGIC"" L,O absent.

Not.

So probably ""QUICK"" or ""JUICY"".

""QUICK"" tests Q,U,C,K and C is already known present, but we can get positions.

Similarly, ""JUICY"" tests J,U,C,Y.

Both U and Y vowel possibilities.

Perhaps ""QUICK"" to test U.

We also have other letters to test.

But we have to guess a word.

Another option: since C is present and at position 2,4, or 5, we can guess a word with C in multiple positions or different.

For example, ""CUBIC"" has C at 1 and 5, position 3 not I.

Not.

"" C I V I C "" position 2 I not 3.

Not.

I think the most common is ""QUICK"".

Letters: Q,U,I,C,K.

Q and K uncommon, but U is valuable.

""BUICK"" not word.

Or ""CLICK"" but L absent, L eliminated.

L absent.

So no.

""KICKS"" K-I-C-K-S, S absent and position 2 I not.

Not.

So ""QUICK"" or similar.

"" CHICK"" C at position 1, but H absent, invalid.

H absent.

So ""QUICK"" seems viable.

""QUAFF"" no I.

So let's go with ""QUICK"".

But position of C is at position 4, which one possibility.

Feedback will give us positions.

Another word: ""JUICE"" but E absent, not.

""YICKS"" not.

So ""QUICK"" is a option.

""QUIFF"" Q-U-I-F-F, so position 3 I, position 4 F, position 5 F, double F.

Not great.

""QUIMS"" no.

So ""QUICK"" is better.

Perhaps ""UMIAC"" not common.

I think we have to choose ""QUICK"".

But let's think of the feedback.

If we guess ""QUICK"", positions:1-Q,2-U,3-I,4-C,5-K

Feedback will tell:
- Q: if correct or present
- U: similarly
- I: correct at position 3
- C: at position 4, which might be correct or wrong position
- K: etc.

But C is present, so if at position 4 is wrong, it must be elsewhere, but since we guess it at 4, if (✓) then good, if (-) then it is at other position.

Similarly for Q,U,K.

With only 3 guesses left, we can risk.

But another word: with U and Y.

For example, ""YUCCA"" Y-U-C-C-A, A absent and position not I.

No.

""MYCIN"" not word.

So I think ""QUICK"" or ""JUICY"".

""JUICY"": J,U,I,C,Y

J less common than Q? Q slightly more than J.

But similar.

Position 3 I, position 4 C, position 5 Y.

In feedback, for CHILD, C at position 1 was (-), so C is elsewhere, but not necessarily at position 4; it could be at position 2 or 5.

In ""JUICY"", if we guess, position 4 is C, so if C is at position 4, it would be (✓) or (-).

But if C is at position 5, for example, then guessing at position 4 might be (x) or (-), but since C is present, it would be (-) if wrong position.

Similarly.

To test if C is at position 2, we could guess a word with C at position 2.

Few examples: ""FCKED"" not a word.

""UCKER"" not.

""BCI"" not.

""MCGUI"" not.

I think it's hard, so perhaps assume C is not at position 2, position 2 could be U or something.

Another possible word: ""BUICK"" not, or ""QUILT"" T absent.

Not.

I think ""QUICK"" is the best choice.

Let's go with ""QUICK"".

But we need a word, so guess ""QUICK"".

Thought process for response:

From CHILD feedback, C is present but not at position 1, so it must be in one of positions 2, 4, or 5. However, positions 2 and 4 were guessed as H and L in CHILD, but H and L are absent, so C cannot be at position 2 or 4 because if it were, it would have been indicated in CHILD feedback? No, in CHILD, position 2 was H, not C, so if C is at position 2, the feedback for position 2 wouldn't show C because we didn't guess C there; we guessed H. So C could be at position 2, and we wouldn't know.

Similarly for position 4, we guessed L, not C.

Position 5 guessed D.

So C could be at position 2,4, or 5.

For example, if C is at position 2, the secret word has C there, but we guessed H, so it showed (x) for H.

Nothing about C at position 2.

Position position.

So C can be at position 2,4, or 5.

With that in mind, for the fourth guess, we want to guess a word that places C in a possible position and uses other letter to test.

""QUICK"" has C at position 4, so if C is at position 4, it will be (✓) or if not, (-) if elsewhere, or we will know.

Similarly, it also tests Q,U,K.

So I'll go with ""QUICK"".

Therefore, guess ""QUICK"".

In the response, include thought process.

Thought process: Based on feedback from ""CHILD"", C is present in the secret word but not at position 1. With positions 2, 4, and 5 being possibilities for C, and given the absence of 11 letters (A,E,H,L,D,R,S,P,O,N,T), the remaining letters include F,G,J,K,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. The guess must hI at position 3 and incorporate C somewhere else. Words like ""QUICK"" (Q,U,I,C,K) fit and test the vowel candidate U and consonant K. Although Q and K are uncommon, this guess efficiently checks if C is at position 4 and provides new informatU and K.

<guess>QUICK</guess>Based on the accumulated feedback:
- Position 3 is confirmed as ""I"".
- C is present in the word but not at position 1 (feedback: C(-)).
- Absent letters: A, E, R, S, P, O, N, T, H, L, D (from all previous feedback).
- Remaining possible letters: B, F, G, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For the fourth guess:
- Must have ""I"" at position 3 (pattern: _ _ I _ _).
- Must include C (per feedback), but C cannot be at position 1. C could be at position 2, 4, or 5.
- Avoid all absent letters.
- Prioritize testing high-frequency unused letters like U (potential vowel), K, and M to maximize information gain.
- Evaluated words:
  - ""QUICK"": Tests Q, U, C at position 4, K. Covers U (critical vowel test) and positions for C. Downside: Q less common.
  - ""JUICY"": Tests J, U, C, Y. J/Y low frequency.
  - ""QUIFF"" or ""QUIMS"": Invalid due to double letters or absent S.
  - Other options sparse due to constraints.

""QUICK"" was selected to validate if C is at position 4 (high probability based on common word structures), test the vowel candidate U, and introduce K—a useful consonant. Feedback will clarify C position and U/K presence, reducing possibilities significantly.",Guess 4: QUICK -> FEEDBACK: Q(x) U(✓) I(✓) C(✓) K(x),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>First, I need to make my first guess for a 5-letter word. Since I have no prior information, I should choose a word that maximizes the information I can gain about the secret word. The best strategy is to use a word with common letters that cover multiple possibilities.

I recall that in games like Wordle, a good starting word often uses common vowels and consonants to cover a broad range of letters. This helps in narrowing down the possibilities based on the feedback.

Common vowels in English are A, E, I, O, U. Common consonants include S, T, N, R, H, L, D, etc.

A popular starting word is ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" because they include frequent letters. Another one is ""ADIEU"", which has many vowels, but since there are only five positions, I need a balance of vowels and consonants.

I should aim for a word with at least two vowels and three consonants to get a good spread.

Let me think of some options:

- ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E – includes common letters S, T, E, A.

- ""CRANE"": C, R, A, N, E – similar, with R, A, N, E.

- ""ROATE"": R, O, A, T, E – which is a less common word but has good coverage.

I need to ensure the word is valid. ""ROATE"" might not be universally recognized; it's better to choose a common word.

""ARISE"" is another good one: A, R, I, S, E – covers vowels A, I, E and consonants R, S.

Or ""IRATE"": I, R, A, T, E.

From feedback perspective, having distinct letters is important so that I can get clear information. If there are repeating letters, it might complicate the feedback, especially for the first guess. So, I should avoid words with duplicate letters.

For example, ""BOOKS"" has repeated O and S, so not ideal. Or ""SPOON"" with double O.

Therefore, I'll avoid repeats.

Suggested words without repeats: ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ADIEU"" (but A and E are vowels, D and U, U is less common), ""STERN"", ""PAINT"", etc.

""ADIEU"" might be good for vowels, but consonants are D, which is medium frequency.

In terms of letter frequency in English words, here's a rough order: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, etc.

So, a word like ""STARE"" – S, T, A, R, E – covers S, T, A, R, E, all high frequency letters.

Similarly, ""CARES"" or ""SLANT"".

""RESIN"": R, E, S, I, N – has R, E, S, I, N.

I think ""STARE"" is a solid choice.

But let's confirm if it's valid. Yes, ""stare"" is a common English word.

""RAISE"" is similar: R, A, I, S, E.

Either is fine.

I'll go with ""RAISE"" for my first guess because it has R, A, I, S, E – four vowels? A, I, E are vowels, R and S are consonants. Vowels: A, I, E; consonants: R, S.

In five letters: positions: 1-R, 2-A, 3-I, 4-S, 5-E.

Yes.

I could use ""CRATE"" or ""SLATE"", but ""RAISE"" seems good.

Another popular one is ""OUIJA"" but that's not as common and has U, which might not be optimal.

I think ""RAISE"" or ""SLATE"" are standard.

Let me choose ""RAISE"" for now.

But the goal is to maximize entropy, meaning that after the guess, the feedback should help reduce the possible word set as much as possible.

Based on studies, words like ""SOARE"" or ""ROATE"" are often recommended, but they are obscure. Better to stick with common words.

""ARISE"" is essentially the same as ""RAISE"", just different starting letter.

I'll use ""ARISE"": A, R, I, S, E.

Same letters.

Perhaps ""STEAM"": S, T, E, A, M – includes M, which is medium frequency.

But ""ARISE"" has higher frequency letters.

E is the most common, then A, R, I, S are all top 10 or so.

Letter frequencies: E is about 12%, T 9%, A 8%, O 7.5%, I 7%, N 7%, S 6.5%, H 6%, R 6%, D 4%, L 4%, etc.

""ARISE"" has A, R, I, S, E – A:8%, R:6%, I:7%, S:6.5%, E:12%. Good coverage.

""SLATE"" has S:6.5%, L:4%, A:8%, T:9%, E:12% – similar, with T instead of I, and L vs R.

T is more common than R or I? T 9% vs R 6%, I 7%, so T is higher.

""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E – L is less common at 4%, while R is 6%. So ""CRATE"" might be better: C: 3%, R:6%, A:8%, T:9%, E:12% – C is lower frequency.

How about ""TRACE"": T, R, A, C, E – again, C is low.

""STARE"": S, T, A, R, E – S:6.5%, T:9%, A:8%, R:6%, E:12%. All solid.

I think ""STARE"" is slightly better because of higher T frequency.

Similarly, ""CRANE"" has N instead of T; N is 7%.

But T is 9%, so ""STARE"" or ""SLATE"".

""SLATE"" has L at 4%, while ""STARE"" has R at 6%, so ""STARE"" has a slightly better average frequency.

I can go with ""STARE"".

But ""RAISE"" has I at 7% vs L in ""SLATE"" at 4%, so ""RAISE"" might be comparable.

No real difference; I'll pick one.

For consistency, I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it's often used, but let's decide.

Since I need to output the guess, I'll go with ""ARISE"".

But in the system prompt, it used ""STORM"" as an example, so any valid word is fine.

I think ""ARISE"" is good.

Let me make a choice.

I'll use ""SALET"" which is a word, but not common; ""salet"" is historical, may not be known. Better avoid.

""ALERT"" is good: A, L, E, R, T.

But I think ""ARISE"" is fine.

To save time, I'll go with ""RAISE"".

Final decision: ""RAISE""

So for the response, I need to think step by step, then output the guess.

Thought process: As this is the first guess with no prior information, I should select a word that contains common letters to maximize the likelihood of getting feedback on frequent vowels and consonants. This helps in narrowing down the possible word list for subsequent guesses. After considering options like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", and ""STARE"", I choose ""RAISE"" as it includes high-frequency letters such as R, A, I, S, and E without any repeats.

Then output in the format.Since this is the first guess, there is no prior feedback to consider. The goal is to choose a starting word that maximizes information gain by including high-frequency letters (vowels and consonants) to narrow down possibilities quickly. After evaluating common options:
- Vowels like A, E, I are frequent and help identify core word structure.
- Consonants like R, S are also common and versatile.
Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""STARE"" are often effective, but ""RAISE"" was selected for its balance:
  - It contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two consonants (R, S), with all letters distinct to avoid ambiguity.
  - Letter frequencies: R (approx. 6%), A (8%), I (7%), S (6.5%), E (12%) cover a broad range of common English letters.
This choice increases the chance of getting useful position or presence feedback to inform later guesses.

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(✓) S(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- I: ✓ (correct position, so the third letter is I)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, from this, we know:
- The third letter is I.
- The letters R, A, S, E are not in the word at all.
- Therefore, the secret word has I as the third letter, and does not contain R, A, S, E.

Now, we need to make a second guess. The guess must be a 5-letter word with I in the third position, and it should avoid using R, A, S, E.

We also want to use this guess to test other common letters to gather more information.

Since I is fixed at position 3, we have to form a word with the pattern _ _ I _ _

We should choose letters that are common and not yet tested. From the first guess, we have eliminated R, A, S, E. So we have to avoid these.

Common letters left: T, O, N, H, L, D, C, U, M, P, etc.

We should aim to include as many new, common letters as possible in the guess.

Possible words that fit the pattern _ _ I _ _ and don't use R, A, S, E:

Let's think of some words:
- With T: e.g., ""POINT"" (P, O, I, N, T) — but we have to check if it avoids R,A,S,E. P, O, I, N, T — yes, none of R,A,S,E.
- ""BUILT"" (B, U, I, L, T) — avoids R,A,S,E.
- ""GUILD"" (G, U, I, L, D) — avoids R,A,S,E.
- ""CHILL"" (C, H, I, L, L) — but has double L, which might not be ideal because it reduces the number of distinct letters. Better to avoid repeats if possible to get more information.
- ""THING"" (T, H, I, N, G) — avoids R,A,S,E.

We want to maximize the number of new letters tested.

Letters we haven't used: from the first guess we used R,A,I,S,E. So we have I already known, but we are testing other positions.

In the second guess, we can test T, O, N, H, L, D, C, U, M, P, etc.

Let's list the frequency: T (9%), O (7.5%), N (7%), H (6%), L (4%), D (4%), C (3%), U (2.5%), M (2.5%), P (2%), etc.

So, high frequency: T, O, N, H.

We should try to include T, O, N, H if possible.

Word with I in the middle and including T, O, N, H.

For example:
- ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T — includes O, N, T (and P). P is less common, but O, N, T are good.
- ""THINK"": T, H, I, N, K — includes T, H, N, K. K is less common, but T, H, N are good.
- ""LIGHT"": L, I, G, H, T — but I is at position 2, not 3. We need I at position 3.
- ""NIGHT"": N, I, G, H, T — I is at position 2? N-I-G-H-T, so positions: 1-N, 2-I, 3-G, 4-H, 5-T. But we need I at position 3, so that's not it.

We need the third letter to be I, so pattern: ? ? I ? ?

So for ""NIGHT"", it's N-I-G-H-T, so I is at position 2, not 3.

Similarly, ""POINT"": P-O-I-N-T, so positions: 1-P, 2-O, 3-I, 4-N, 5-T. Perfect.

""BUILT"": B-U-I-L-T, so 1-B, 2-U, 3-I, 4-L, 5-T.

""GUILD"": G-U-I-L-D, 1-G, 2-U, 3-I, 4-L, 5-D.

""CHILL"": C-H-I-L-L, 1-C, 2-H, 3-I, 4-L, 5-L — but double L, so not ideal.

""THING"": T-H-I-N-G, 1-T, 2-H, 3-I, 4-N, 5-G.

""DOING"": D-O-I-N-G, 1-D, 2-O, 3-I, 4-N, 5-G.

""GOING"": G-O-I-N-G, but has double G? G-O-I-N-G, so 1-G, 2-O, 3-I, 4-N, 5-G — G is repeated, so not good for information.

""JOINT"": J-O-I-N-T — J is rare.

""MOIST"": M-O-I-S-T — but S is eliminated, we cannot use S because S is not in the word (from feedback, S is x, meaning not in word). So we must avoid S.

Similarly, we must avoid R, A, E as well.

So ""MOIST"" has S, which is invalid.

Similarly, ""POINT"" is good: P-O-I-N-T, no R,A,S,E.

""BUILT"": B-U-I-L-T, no R,A,S,E.

""THING"": T-H-I-N-G, no R,A,S,E.

""DOING"": D-O-I-N-G, no R,A,S,E.

""FLING"": F-L-I-N-G, no R,A,S,E.

""CLING"": C-L-I-N-G, etc.

Now, among these, which one has the most common letters? ""POINT"" has O, N, T which are high frequency. P is less common, but it's acceptable.

""THING"" has T, H, N, G — H and N are good, G is medium.

""DOING"" has O, N, G — O and N are high.

But ""POINT"" has O, N, T — T is the most common consonant.

We also want to cover different letters to test more.

Since we know I is in the word and at position 3, we don't need to test I again, but we can use it to form the word.

In the feedback, for the second guess, we will get information about the other positions.

I think ""POINT"" is a good choice: it tests P, O, N, T in positions 1,2,4,5, and we know position 3 is I.

Similarly, ""THING"" tests T, H, N, G.

But ""POINT"" might be better because O and T are very common.

Another word: ""JOINT"" but J is rare.

""MOUNT"": M-O-U-N-T — but U is less common, and we have I at position 3? M-O-U-N-T has U at position 3, not I. We need I at position 3.

""POINT"" seems solid.

""BUILT"" has U, which is less common, but it's okay.

I think ""POINT"" is a standard word.

We could use ""BLIND"": B-L-I-N-D — but L and D are medium, and we avoid R,A,S,E.

But ""POINT"" has higher frequency letters.

Let's compare the frequency sum for the new letters:

For ""POINT"": P (2%), O (7.5%), N (7%), T (9%) — but we are testing positions 1,2,4,5. Position 3 is I, which we already know, so we don't get new info about I, but we use it to form the word.

The feedback will tell us about P, O, N, T.

Similarly for ""THING"": T (9%), H (6%), N (7%), G (2%) — T and N are high, H medium, G low.

""POINT"" has O and T high, N high, P low.

O is 7.5%, T 9%, N 7%, P 2% — average better than ""THING"" which has G at 2%.

""DOING"": D (4%), O (7.5%), N (7%), G (2%) — D and G lower.

So ""POINT"" seems best.

Another word: ""PRINT"" — but P-R-I-N-T, R is eliminated, we cannot use R. R is not in the word, so avoid.

Similarly, ""TRAIN"" has R and A, both eliminated.

So ""POINT"" is good.

""JOINT"" has J, which is very rare.

""QUINT"" has Q and U, Q is rare.

So I think ""POINT"" is a reasonable choice.

Therefore, I'll go with ""POINT"" for the second guess.

Thought process: Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"", we know that the third letter is 'I' and that 'R', 'A', 'S', 'E' are not in the word. Therefore, the second guess must have 'I' in the third position and avoid using the letters R, A, S, E. The goal is to test new common letters to gather more information. After considering words like ""THING"", ""BUILT"", and ""DOING"", ""POINT"" was selected because it includes high-frequency letters O, N, T (and P) in distinct positions, maximizing the potential for useful feedback on letter presence and position.

<guess>POINT</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- The third letter is ""I"" and in the correct position (✓).
- The letters ""R"", ""A"", ""S"", and ""E"" are not in the word at all (x).

For the second guess:
- The word must have ""I"" as the third letter (position 3).
- It must avoid using the letters R, A, S, or E.
- To maximize information gain, I should prioritize common unused letters (e.g., T, O, N, L, C, H) and avoid repeating letters to test more possibilities.

After evaluating options:
- ""POINT"" fits the criteria: it has ""I"" in position 3, avoids R/A/S/E, and tests new high-frequency letters (T, O, N) and the less common P. This provides broad coverage to narrow down the word list effectively.

<guess>POINT</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(✓) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(✓) N(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:
- Guess 1: RAISE -> R(x), A(x), I(✓), S(x), E(x) → I is correct and in position 3; R, A, S, E not in word.
- Guess 2: POINT -> P(x), O(x), I(✓), N(x), T(x) → I is still ✓ in position 3 (which we knew), and P, O, N, T not in word.

So now we know:
- The third letter is I. No change.
- Additional letters not in the word: P, O, N, T (from POINT), plus R, A, S, E (from RAISE). So total absent letters: R, A, S, E, P, O, N, T.

Letters that could be in the word: from the alphabet, subtract the absent ones.

Absent: A, E, I? Wait, I is in the word, so I is present but we already know its position.

Known present: I (at position 3).

Absent: R, A, S, E, P, O, N, T.

Possible remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we need common English letters, so likely consonants and possibly U or Y as vowels.

Since no other letters have been confirmed present yet except I, we must consider that the word has other letters from the remaining pool.

The word pattern is _ _ I _ _ (5 letters, third is I).

We have used letters: from RAISE: R,A,I,S,E and POINT: P,O,I,N,T. I is repeated, but we knew that.

So letters tested and absent: A,E,P,O,N,T,R,S. That's 8 letters plus E which is already included? List: A, E, R, S, P, O, N, T.

Absent: A, E, R, S, P, O, N, T.

Possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I? I is already in and we know position, so for other positions, we need to guess from letters not absent, excluding I since it's fixed at position 3 but can be used elsewhere? No, I is fixed at position 3, but could it be elsewhere? The feedback only shows that position 3 is I, but it doesn't preclude other I's. For example, in ""CIVIC"", I can appear multiple times.

But in guess 1, we had I as ✓, but the other positions had E, which was absent, so E is not in the word, but I could be duplicate? Let's see the feedback.

For RAISE: I(✓) means the letter in position 3 is correct (I). The other positions: R(x) means R is not in the word at all, similarly A(x), S(x), E(x) mean A, S, E not in word. But it doesn't say anything about additional I's. Similarly for POINT, P(x), O(x), N(x), T(x) mean no P,O,N,T in word, and I(✓) confirms position 3 I.

But since position 3 is I, and no other I was guessed in positions 1,2,4,5, it doesn't tell us if there could be another I. For example, the word could have I at position 3 and say at position 1, but since we didn't guess I elsewhere, we don't know.

In RAISE, position 4 is S, which was absent, but if we had guessed a word with I in other positions, it might show -, but we haven't. So possibly, the word could have multiple I's.

But with only I confirmed, we need to guess words with other letters.

Now, from remaining letters: common ones are B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, U, W, Y.

Vowels: we have U and possibly Y as semi-vowel, but vowels in English are A,E,I,O,U – A,E,O are absent, so U is the only vowel left besides I? But Y can be vowel too.

So possible vowels: I, U, Y.

But I is fixed at position 3, so other positions should have consonants or U/Y.

Possible words: pattern _ _ I _ _

Letters to use from: B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. But J,Q,X,Z are low frequency, so focus on B,C,D,F,G,H,L,M,U,W,Y.

For this guess, we want to test more common letters to find which are present.

Common unused: L, H, D, U, C, M, etc.

So we should construct a word with I at position 3, using letters not eliminated.

For example:

- Words with L: e.g., ""GUIL D"" but D is possible, and we have to avoid absent letters. G,U,I,L,D – no A,E,R,S,P,O,N,T.

""GUILD"" is a word? Yes, GUILD.

Similarly, ""BUILD"" – B,U,I,L,D – same idea.

""CLIMB"" – C,L,I,M,B – and M is possible.

""FLICK"" – F,L,I,C,K – K possible.

""THICK"" but T and H: T is absent, so no, T cannot be used.

T is absent, from POINT feedback T(x), so avoid T.

Similarly O,N,P absent.

So letters to avoid: A,E,R,S,P,O,N,T.

Letters to use: B,C,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. High frequency: C, D, F, G, H, L, M.

Now, possible words:

With U: since it's a vowel, might be good to test.

e.g., ""QUICK"" but Q is uncommon, and we have U,I,C,K.

""BUILD"": B,U,I,L,D

""GUILT"" but T absent, so no.

""GUILD"" is good.

""FLUID"": F,L,U,I,D – avoids absent letters.

""CLUMP"" but P absent? P is absent, yes.

P absent, so cannot use P.

""JUICE"" but E absent? E is absent, so no.

""DUCHY"" – D,U,C,H,Y – all valid? D,U,C,H,Y not absent.

Y is possible.

Another word: ""LUCKY"" – L,U,C,K,Y – but position 3 must be I? Pattern must have I at position 3, so ""LUCKY"" is L-U-C-K-Y, no I, so not acceptable. Must have I at position 3.

So only words with I in the middle.

""QUILT"" but T absent, no.

""BUILD"": B(1), U(2), I(3), L(4), D(5) – BUILD is a word.

""GUILD"": G(1), U(2), I(3), L(4), D(5) – same as BUILD with G.

""FLUID"": F(1), L(2), U(3)? Wait no, FLUID is F-L-U-I-D, positions: 1-F, 2-L, 3-U? But we need I at position 3. F-L-U-I-D has U at position 3, I at position 4. We need position 3 to be I.

So must be ? ? I ? ?, so first two letters, then I, then last two.

So ""BUILD"" is B-U-I-L-D, so 1-B,2-U,3-I,4-L,5-D. Good.

""GUILD"" similarly G-U-I-L-D.

""CLINK"": C-L-I-N-K but N absent, N is eliminated, so cannot use N.

From POINT, N(x), so absent.

Similarly ""BLIMP"" has P, absent.

""CHILD"": C-H-I-L-D – avoids absent letters? H,L,C,D possible.

C-H-I-L-D: positions 1-C,2-H,3-I,4-L,5-D.

Similarly ""MILD"": M-I-L-D but I at position 2? M-I-L-D has only four positions? Must be five letters.

""MILKY"": M-I-L-K-Y, position 1-M,2-I, then 3-L, but we need position 3 to be I, not L. So it must be I at 3.

""CHILL"": C-H-I-L-L, but double L, repeats, reduces information.

Better to avoid repeats if possible.

""GRIMY"": G-R-I-M-Y but R absent, cannot use R.

R is absent.

""WHINY"": W-H-I-N-Y but N absent.

So possible options without repeats: ""BUILD"", ""GUILD"", ""CHILD"", ""FILMY"" (but FILMY has Y, meaning covered with film), F-I-L-M-Y? Positions: 1-F,2-I? Not 3-I.

We need position 3 to be I.

""CHILD"": C-H-I-L-D, perfect.

""FIELD"": F-I-E-L-D but E absent? E is absent, from RAISE, E(x), so cannot use E.

So ""FIELD"" invalid.

""YIELD"": Y-I-E-L-D, has E, absent.

No.

""GUILT"" has T, absent.

So back to ""BUILD"", ""GUILD"", ""CHILD"".

""CIVIC"": C-I-V-I-C, has I at position 2 and 4, but position 3 is V? Position: 1-C,2-I,3-V,4-I,5-C. Position 3 is V, not I. So not I at 3.

We must have I at position 3.

""VALID"": V-A-L-I-D but A absent, no.

So ""CHILD"": C,H,I,L,D – letters C,H,L,D possible.

""BUILD"": B,U,I,L,D

""GUILD"": G,U,I,L,D

""FLUID"": F-L-U-I-D, position 3 is U? F-L-U-I-D, so 1=F,2=L,3=U,4=I,5=D. Position 3 is U, not I. So only if position 3 is I.

What about ""QUIET""? Q-U-I-E-T, but E and T absent, no.

""QUILL"" double L, and position? Q-U-I-L-L, positions 1-Q,2-U,3-I,4-L,5-L. So it has I at 3.

But double L repeats.

Better to avoid if possible.

""SKIMP"" S absent? S is absent.

We have U for vowel or Y.

Another word: ""CLIMB"": C-L-I-M-B, that could work: C,L,I,M,B.

""MOLDY"" no I.

""CHIME"": C-H-I-M-E, E absent.

No.

""WHILE"" W-H-I-L-E, E absent.

So back to: ""CHILD"", ""BUILD"", ""GUILD"", or ""JUICE"" but E absent, not.

""BLUID""? Not a word.

Perhaps ""FLUID"" cannot because position 3 not I.

Unless it's spelled F-L-U-I-D, but L-U-I, position 3 U, not I.

Standard spelling, position varies.

Another word: ""BRICK"" B-R-I-C-K, but R absent.

R is gone.

""PRICK"" P and R absent.

""THICK"" T absent.

So available: ""CHILD"" seems good: C-H-I-L-D.

""CHILL"" double L.

""GUIDE"" G-U-I-D-E, E absent.

""QUICK"" Q-U-I-C-K, that is Q-U-I-C-K, positions 1-Q,2-U,3-I,4-C,5-K. So it has I at 3.

Similarly, ""QUACK"" no I.

So ""QUICK"" is an option, but Q is uncommon, so might not be the secret word, but it could be.

But we want to test common letters.

""QUICK"": Q,U,I,C,K – letters Q,U,C,K.

Q and K are less common, U and C medium.

Compared to ""CHILD"": C,H,L,D – C,H,L,D more common than Q,U,C,K? C is in both, H,L,D vs U,K,Q.

H is 6%, L 4%, D 4%, U 2.5%, K 1%, Q very low.

So ""CHILD"" tests H,L,D which are better than U,K,Q.

But ""QUICK"" tests U and C.

Since C is common, testing it might be good.

But let's see another option.

""BUILD"": B,U,I,L,D – B low frequency, U medium, L,D medium.

Similarly ""GUILD"": G,U,I,L,D – G low.

""CHILD"": C,H,I,L,D – C,H,L,D all medium frequency.

C:3%, H:6%, L:4%, D:4%.

Not bad.

""DWARF"" no I.

Perhaps ""CHIMY"" not a word.

I think ""CHILD"" or ""BUILD"" are fine.

Also, with U, we can use ""BUILD"" to test U.

U is the only vowel possibility left besides Y, so it might be important to test it.

In ""BUILD"", U is at position 2.

Similarly in ""CHILD"", H is at position 2.

Both are consonants? H is consonant, U is vowel.

Since we lack vowel information, testing U might be valuable.

For example, if U is present, we get more clues.

If not, we eliminate it.

Similarly for Y.

But Y is less common.

So perhaps ""BUILD"" to test U.

""GUILD"" same.

Or ""QUICK"", but Q is rare.

Let's decide.

Perhaps a word like ""LYMPH"" no I.

Another one: ""WIMPY"" W-I-M-P-Y, position 3 not I.

Not.

So between ""CHILD"" and ""BUILD"", I'll choose ""CHILD"" because it avoids U which might be less necessary, but U could be key.

Since A,E,O are absent, U might be in the word or not.

At this point, with few guesses left, we need to be efficient.

Perhaps list possible words.

The secret word has I at position 3, no R,A,S,E,P,O,N,T.

Possible words:

- With C: CHILD, CHINK? But N absent, CHINK has N which is absent? CHINK has N, but N absent.

From POINT, N(x), so N absent.

So CHILD is good.

FLUID not, position wrong.

GUILD good.

BLIND: B-L-I-N-D, N absent, no.

BUILD good.

CLIMB: C-L-I-M-B, good.

DUTCH: D-U-T-C-H, T absent.

Invalid.

LUCK: not 5 letters.

JUMBO: no I.

So shortlist:

- BUILD (B,U,I,L,D)

- GUILD (G,U,I,L,D)

- CHILD (C,H,I,L,D)

- CLIMB (C,L,I,M,B)

- JUICE? J,U,I,C,E but E absent.

Not.

QUICK (Q,U,I,C,K)

 But Q and K uncommon.

Other words like: PHYLC not a word.

MYTHIC not 5 letters.

So realistic: BUILD, GUILD, CHILD, CLIMB.

CLIMB has B, which is low freq, but possible.

To maximize new letters, let's see what each tests.

For example:
- BUILD: tests B,U,L,D
- GUILD: tests G,U,L,D
- CHILD: tests C,H,L,D
- CLIMB: tests C,L,M,B

All test L and one more consonant plus U or not.

In CHILD, H is tested, in BUILD U is tested.

Since U is a vowel possibility, it might be worth testing.

Moreover, U is more common than H? H: 6%, U: 2.5%, so H is more common, but U as vowel may be critical.

Perhaps ""FIC us"" not a word.

""BLUID"" not standard.

I think both are fine.

Perhaps choose ""BUILD"" to check if U is present.

But let's set the strategy.

We have only one letter known, so we need to find the other four.

After this guess, we will get feedback.

So for this turn, guess one of these.

I'll go with ""CHILD"" for now.

But CHILD has H and L, etc.

Another word: ""MILCH"" M-I-L-C-H, position 2 I? Must be position 3 I.

Not.

""WICCA"" no I.

So I think ""CHILD"" is reasonable.

Or ""BLIMP"" but P absent.

No.

""GRIMY"" G-R-I-M-Y, R absent.

So CHILD it is.

But we can think of frequency.

Most common remaining letters: C, H, D, L, U, M, etc.

C has 3%, L 4%, H 6%, D 4%, U 2.5%, M 2.5%.

Average.

Perhaps ""CLIMB"" tests M.

But BUILD tests U.

Let's see if there is a word with multiple high frequency.

For example, ""CULLY"" but U and L I position? C-U-L-L-Y, position 3 L, not I.

Not.

""DILLY"" D-I-L-L-Y, position 2 I.

Not.

""GILLY"" similar.

I think ""CHILD"" or ""BUILD"" are the way to go.

I'll choose ""CHILD"" to test H and C.

So guess: CHILD

Thought process: Based on accumulated feedback:
- Position 3 is ""I"".
- Absent letters: R, A, S, E, P, O, N, T.
- The second guess ""POINT"" ruled out P, O, N, T aside from confirming position 3.
For the third guess, we need a 5-letter word with ""I"" at position 3, using only untested letters from the remaining pool (B,C,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,U,W,Y,Z). Priority is to test common consonants like C, L, H, D and vowel U.
After considering options such as ""BUILD"", ""GUILD"", ""CLIMB"", and ""QUICK"", ""CHILD"" is selected because it contains high-utility letters C, H, L, D (all distinct and reasonably common), avoiding rare letters and focusing on likely consonants. If ""CHILD"" is incorrect, the feedback willprovide new presence/absence information for C, H, L, D and their positions.

<guess>CHILD</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- Guess 1 ""RAISE"": I is correct and in position 3; R, A, S, E are absent.
- Guess 2 ""POINT"": I is still correct in position 3; P, O, N, T are absent.
- Total absent letters: A, E, R, S, P, O, N, T.  
- Position 3 is confirmed as ""I"".  
- Available letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, W, Y (common English letters from remaining pool).  

For the third guess:  
- Must have ""I"" in position 3 (pattern: _ _ I _ _).  
- Avoid all absent letters.  
- Prioritize testing high-frequency unused letters like C, L, H, D, U to maximize information gain.  
- Words evaluated:  
  - ""BUILD"" (tests B, U, L, D) – good for U (vowel test), but U less common.  
  - ""GUILD"" (tests G, U, L, D) – similar, G low frequency.  
  - ""CLIMB"" (tests C, L, M, B) – adds M but weak vowel coverage.  
  - ""CHILD"" (tests C, H, L, D) – optimal: C, H, L, D are high-value consonant tests; all letters distinct and moderate frequency.  

**Selected ""CHILD""**: Tests C, H, L, D—common letters not yet examined—and uses position 3 ""I"". Feedback will reveal new presences/absences and positions (especially for H, a frequent consonant, and potential vowel substitutes like Y).

<guess>CHILD</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(✓) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(✓) N(x) T(x)
Guess 3: CHILD -> FEEDBACK: C(-) H(x) I(✓) L(x) D(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the third guess ""CHILD"":
- C(-): C is in the word but in the wrong position
- H(x): H is not in the word
- I(✓): I is correct and in position 3 (already known)
- L(x): L is not in the word
- D(x): D is not in the word

From previous guesses:
- Position 3 is I.
- Absent letters: A, E, R, S, P, O, N, T, H, L, D. From all feedback:
  - RAISE: R(x), A(x), S(x), E(x) → absent
  - POINT: P(x), O(x), N(x), T(x) → absent
  - CHILD: H(x), L(x), D(x) → absent, and C(-) means C is present but not at position 1.

So now, absent letters: A, E, R, S, P, O, N, T, H, L, D.

Present letters:
- I is in position 3.
- C is in the word, but not at position 1. Since it gave (-) for position 1, and other positions we don't know yet.

C could be in position 2, 4, or 5.

Pattern is _ _ I _ _

Also, since H, L, D are absent, and from CHILD, we have positions:
1: C which is wrong position (so C not in pos 1), but C is somewhere else.

Now, we know C is present, but not at pos 1, and possibly not at pos 3 since that is I, but C and I are different letters, so C cannot be at pos 3.

Positions: 1: C (wrong position), 2: H (absent), 3: I (correct), 4: L (absent), 5: D (absent).

So C must be in position 2, 4, or 5? No, the word has other positions.

The secret word has C in it, but not at position 1, and possibly at position 2,4, or 5.

But in CHILD, position 2 was H, which is absent, so not C there? Not necessarily, because C could be in position 2, but we guessed H at pos 2, so if C were at pos 2, it would have shown differently.

In CHILD, we guessed:
Pos1: C → feedback (-) meaning C is in word but not here. So C is not at position 1.
Pos2: H → feedback (x) meaning H not in word at all.
Pos3: I → (✓) correct.
Pos4: L → (x) L not in word.
Pos5: D → (x) D not in word.

So C is in the word, but since the feedback for pos1 is (-), C must be in one of the other positions: 2,4, or 5.

But position 2: we guessed H, not C, so if C were at position 2, the feedback for position 2 would be (-) or (✓), but since we guessed H and H is absent, it's (x), so nothing about C being at pos 2. Similarly for other positions.

C could be at position 2,4, or 5.

For example, if C is at position 2, but we didn't guess C at position 2; we guessed H, which was wrong. So the feedback doesn't tell us which other position C is at.

We need to guess a word that has C at possible positions and I at position 3, and avoids absent letters.

Absent letters: A,E,R,S,P,O,N,T,H,L,D.

So remaining possible letters: B,F,G,J,K,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. And from previous, C is present, I is present at pos 3.

C must be in the word, so in positions 2,4, or 5.

Also, possible vowels: only U or Y, since A,E,I,O absent? I is present, O absent, A,E absent.

Vowel possibilities: U, or sometimes Y.

But I is already in.

So for other positions, we need to use letters from remaining.

Possible words with C in the word at different positions and I at position 3.

First, list letters to use: available letters include B,F,G,J,K,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z, and C is for sure.

But C must be placed.

Now, common letters left: F,G,K,M,U,W,Y.

Low frequency: J,Q,V,X,Z.

Avoid repeats if possible.

Pattern: ? ? I ? ?

C must be in position 2,4, or 5.

So cases:

- If C is position 2: pattern _ C I _ _
- If C is position 4: pattern _ _ I C _
- If C is position 5: pattern _ _ I _ C

We need to guess a word that fits one of these and uses other new letters to test.

For example, if C is at position 4, word like _ _ I C _

But what words?

Similarly for other positions.

Since we don't know where C is, we need to guess a word that covers multiple possibilities.

But with the constraints, few words exist.

Moreover, we have to avoid absent letters.

Possible words with I at position 3 and C somewhere else.

For example:

- If C at position 2: pattern _ C I _ _
  Example words: ""UCIFI"" not word, ""ACID"" but A absent, no. Absent letters.
  Available: so position 1: must be letter not absent, like F,G,U,K,etc.
  And position 4 and 5.
  So possible "" F C I K "" with K not good.
  "" F C I E D "" E absent.
  Hard to find.
  "" U C I K Y "" not word.

I am considering real words.

Shortlist possible words given constraints.

Remember, the word must be valid English 5-letter word.

With I at position 3, C in the word not at position 1, and absent letters avoided.

Possible positions for C:

First, C could be at position 4: e.g., words like ? ? I C ?

Position 4 C.

For example, ""MUSIC"" is M-U-S-I-C, but S isabsent and position 4 S? Wait, ""MUSIC"" positions:1-M,2-U,3-S,4-I? But we need position 3 to be I, here position 4 is I? Not.

Pattern must be position 3 I.

For position 4: C, pattern _ _ I C _

So letters 4: C.

Words ending with C? But rarely, except like ""MUSIC"" but wrong I position.

"" COMIC "" C-O-M-I-C but O absent and C not position 4? Positions:1-C,2-O,3-M,4-I,5-C — no, position 3 M not I.

If we have _ _ I C _, e.g., ""BICEP"" B-I-C-E-P but E and P absent, and I at position 2? B-I-C-E-P:1-B,2-I,3-C,4-E,5-P.

Not position 3 I.

We need first two letters, then I at 3, then C at 4, then last letter.

For example, word like ""CUBIC"" but C at start? ""CUBIC"" C-U-B-I-C, positions:1-C,2-U,3-B? Not I. Position 3 B.

Not.

""MEDIC"" M-E-D-I-C, E absent and positions:1-M,2-E,3-D,4-I,5-C — position 4 I, not 3.

Hard to find words with I at position 3 and C at position 4.

With C at position 5: pattern _ _ I _ C

Word ending with C and I at position 3.

For example, ""JUICY"" J-U-I-C-Y, positions:1-J,2-U,3-I,4-C,5-Y — yes, position 3 I, and position 4 C, position 5 Y.

Not C at position 5.

Position 5 C.

_JUICY has position 4 C or position 5 Y.

""TONIC"" T-O-N-I-C, T,O,N absent.

""MANIC"" M-A-N-I-C, A,N absent.

"" PANIC "" P-A-N-I-C, P,A,N absent.

""GENIC"" G-E-N-I-C, E,N absent.

""LYRIC"" L-Y-R-I-C, L absent? L is absent from CHILD L(x), so L absent. And R absent.

Not.

""MYCIC"" not word.

""CIVIC"" C-I-V-I-C, but position 3 V? C-I-V-I-C:1-C,2-I,3-V,4-I,5-C. Position 3 V not I.

So rare.

Now, other position, C at position 2: pattern _ C I _ _

For example, ""AC ID"" not, absent letters.
"" U C I F Y "" not word.
"" S C I F I "" not.

Similarly, ""ECLIPSE"" too many letters.

I think there are few options.

Perhaps C at position 4 or 5 is difficult.

Maybe C is at position 2.

For instance, ""UCK IN"" not word.

Another idea: words like ""CYKES"" not common.

Perhaps ""WHICH"" W-H-I-C-H, but H absent, and position 3 I, position 4 C? ""WHICH"" 1-W,2-H,3-I,4-C,5-H — H absent, so invalid.

But H is absent.

Similarly, "" PICKY "" P-I-C-K-Y, P absent and I at position 2? Not.

Position 3 I: ""  P I C K Y "" no.

We need position 3 I.

List all possible words from the remaining letters.

Available letters: B,F,G,J,K,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z and C must be in.

With pattern _ _ I _ _

And C in 2,4, or 5.

For example:
- Position 2 C: so word like X C I Y Z, where Y and Z are other letters.
  Position 1: say B, F, G, K, M, U, W, Y? But Y can be consonant.
  Position 4 and 5: similar.

Words: ""BCI"" not word.

""CIGAR"" C at start, but position wrong.

I think we have to accept that C might be at position 5 or 4.

Another common word: ""MUCKI"" not 5 letters.

""QUICK"" we thought earlier, but QUICK is Q-U-I-C-K, positions 1-Q,2-U,3-I,4-C,5-K.

So it has position 3 I, and C at position 4.

C is at position 4, and Q,U,K.

Q and K are available? Absent letters don't include Q,U,K.

From feedback, no Q,U,K eliminated yet.

Similarly, ""QUICK"" avoids absent letters: Q,U,C,K are all possible, and I at 3.

Also, U is a vowel candidate.

But Q is low frequency, but possible.

Feedback from CHILD: C(-) , which means C is in the word but not at position 1, and in QUICK, position 4 C, so U at position 2, etc.

Another word: ""CIVIC"" not position 3 I.

""JUICY"" is J-U-I-C-Y, which has position 3 I, position 4 C, position 5 Y.

Y possible.

""JUICY"" might work, J,U,C,Y.

C at position 4.

Or ""GUICY"" not word.

""BUICK"" not word.

So possible words: ""QUICK"", ""JUICY"", etc.

""QUICK"" is valid.

For C at position 5: ""  ... I .. C "" like ""VODIC"" not word, ""LOGIC"" L,O absent.

Not.

So probably ""QUICK"" or ""JUICY"".

""QUICK"" tests Q,U,C,K and C is already known present, but we can get positions.

Similarly, ""JUICY"" tests J,U,C,Y.

Both U and Y vowel possibilities.

Perhaps ""QUICK"" to test U.

We also have other letters to test.

But we have to guess a word.

Another option: since C is present and at position 2,4, or 5, we can guess a word with C in multiple positions or different.

For example, ""CUBIC"" has C at 1 and 5, position 3 not I.

Not.

"" C I V I C "" position 2 I not 3.

Not.

I think the most common is ""QUICK"".

Letters: Q,U,I,C,K.

Q and K uncommon, but U is valuable.

""BUICK"" not word.

Or ""CLICK"" but L absent, L eliminated.

L absent.

So no.

""KICKS"" K-I-C-K-S, S absent and position 2 I not.

Not.

So ""QUICK"" or similar.

"" CHICK"" C at position 1, but H absent, invalid.

H absent.

So ""QUICK"" seems viable.

""QUAFF"" no I.

So let's go with ""QUICK"".

But position of C is at position 4, which one possibility.

Feedback will give us positions.

Another word: ""JUICE"" but E absent, not.

""YICKS"" not.

So ""QUICK"" is a option.

""QUIFF"" Q-U-I-F-F, so position 3 I, position 4 F, position 5 F, double F.

Not great.

""QUIMS"" no.

So ""QUICK"" is better.

Perhaps ""UMIAC"" not common.

I think we have to choose ""QUICK"".

But let's think of the feedback.

If we guess ""QUICK"", positions:1-Q,2-U,3-I,4-C,5-K

Feedback will tell:
- Q: if correct or present
- U: similarly
- I: correct at position 3
- C: at position 4, which might be correct or wrong position
- K: etc.

But C is present, so if at position 4 is wrong, it must be elsewhere, but since we guess it at 4, if (✓) then good, if (-) then it is at other position.

Similarly for Q,U,K.

With only 3 guesses left, we can risk.

But another word: with U and Y.

For example, ""YUCCA"" Y-U-C-C-A, A absent and position not I.

No.

""MYCIN"" not word.

So I think ""QUICK"" or ""JUICY"".

""JUICY"": J,U,I,C,Y

J less common than Q? Q slightly more than J.

But similar.

Position 3 I, position 4 C, position 5 Y.

In feedback, for CHILD, C at position 1 was (-), so C is elsewhere, but not necessarily at position 4; it could be at position 2 or 5.

In ""JUICY"", if we guess, position 4 is C, so if C is at position 4, it would be (✓) or (-).

But if C is at position 5, for example, then guessing at position 4 might be (x) or (-), but since C is present, it would be (-) if wrong position.

Similarly.

To test if C is at position 2, we could guess a word with C at position 2.

Few examples: ""FCKED"" not a word.

""UCKER"" not.

""BCI"" not.

""MCGUI"" not.

I think it's hard, so perhaps assume C is not at position 2, position 2 could be U or something.

Another possible word: ""BUICK"" not, or ""QUILT"" T absent.

Not.

I think ""QUICK"" is the best choice.

Let's go with ""QUICK"".

But we need a word, so guess ""QUICK"".

Thought process for response:

From CHILD feedback, C is present but not at position 1, so it must be in one of positions 2, 4, or 5. However, positions 2 and 4 were guessed as H and L in CHILD, but H and L are absent, so C cannot be at position 2 or 4 because if it were, it would have been indicated in CHILD feedback? No, in CHILD, position 2 was H, not C, so if C is at position 2, the feedback for position 2 wouldn't show C because we didn't guess C there; we guessed H. So C could be at position 2, and we wouldn't know.

Similarly for position 4, we guessed L, not C.

Position 5 guessed D.

So C could be at position 2,4, or 5.

For example, if C is at position 2, the secret word has C there, but we guessed H, so it showed (x) for H.

Nothing about C at position 2.

Position position.

So C can be at position 2,4, or 5.

With that in mind, for the fourth guess, we want to guess a word that places C in a possible position and uses other letter to test.

""QUICK"" has C at position 4, so if C is at position 4, it will be (✓) or if not, (-) if elsewhere, or we will know.

Similarly, it also tests Q,U,K.

So I'll go with ""QUICK"".

Therefore, guess ""QUICK"".

In the response, include thought process.

Thought process: Based on feedback from ""CHILD"", C is present in the secret word but not at position 1. With positions 2, 4, and 5 being possibilities for C, and given the absence of 11 letters (A,E,H,L,D,R,S,P,O,N,T), the remaining letters include F,G,J,K,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. The guess must hI at position 3 and incorporate C somewhere else. Words like ""QUICK"" (Q,U,I,C,K) fit and test the vowel candidate U and consonant K. Although Q and K are uncommon, this guess efficiently checks if C is at position 4 and provides new informatU and K.

<guess>QUICK</guess>Based on the accumulated feedback:
- Position 3 is confirmed as ""I"".
- C is present in the word but not at position 1 (feedback: C(-)).
- Absent letters: A, E, R, S, P, O, N, T, H, L, D (from all previous feedback).
- Remaining possible letters: B, F, G, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For the fourth guess:
- Must have ""I"" at position 3 (pattern: _ _ I _ _).
- Must include C (per feedback), but C cannot be at position 1. C could be at position 2, 4, or 5.
- Avoid all absent letters.
- Prioritize testing high-frequency unused letters like U (potential vowel), K, and M to maximize information gain.
- Evaluated words:
  - ""QUICK"": Tests Q, U, C at position 4, K. Covers U (critical vowel test) and positions for C. Downside: Q less common.
  - ""JUICY"": Tests J, U, C, Y. J/Y low frequency.
  - ""QUIFF"" or ""QUIMS"": Invalid due to double letters or absent S.
  - Other options sparse due to constraints.

""QUICK"" was selected to validate if C is at position 4 (high probability based on common word structures), test the vowel candidate U, and introduce K—a useful consonant. Feedback will clarify C position and U/K presence, reducing possibilities significantly.

Since I have no prior information, I should choose a word that maximizes the information I can gain about the secret word. The best strategy is to use a word with common letters that cover multiple possibilities.\n\nI recall that in games like Wordle, a good starting word often uses common vowels and consonants to cover a broad range of letters. This helps in narrowing down the possibilities based on the feedback.\n\nCommon vowels in English are A, E, I, O, U. Common consonants include S, T, N, R, H, L, D, etc.\n\nA popular starting word is ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" because they include frequent letters. Another one is ""ADIEU"", which has many vowels, but since there are only five positions, I need a balance of vowels and consonants.\n\nI should aim for a word with at least two vowels and three consonants to get a good spread.\n\nLet me think of some options:\n\n- ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E – includes common letters S, T, E, A.\n\n- ""CRANE"": C, R, A, N, E – similar, with R, A, N, E.\n\n- ""ROATE"": R, O, A, T, E – which is a less common word but has good coverage.\n\nI need to ensure the word is valid. ""ROATE"" might not be universally recognized; it\'s better to choose a common word.\n\n""ARISE"" is another good one: A, R, I, S, E – covers vowels A, I, E and consonants R, S.\n\nOr ""IRATE"": I, R, A, T, E.\n\nFrom feedback perspective, having distinct letters is important so that I can get clear information. If there are repeating letters, it might complicate the feedback, especially for the first guess. So, I should avoid words with duplicate letters.\n\nFor example, ""BOOKS"" has repeated O and S, so not ideal. Or ""SPOON"" with double O.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll avoid repeats.\n\nSuggested words without repeats: ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ADIEU"" (but A and E are vowels, D and U, U is less common), ""STERN"", ""PAINT"", etc.\n\n""ADIEU"" might be good for vowels, but consonants are D, which is medium frequency.\n\nIn terms of letter frequency in English words, here\'s a rough order: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, etc.\n\nSo, a word like ""STARE"" – S, T, A, R, E – covers S, T, A, R, E, all high frequency letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""CARES"" or ""SLANT"".\n\n""RESIN"": R, E, S, I, N – has R, E, S, I, N.\n\nI think ""STARE"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut let\'s confirm if it\'s valid. Yes, ""stare"" is a common English word.\n\n""RAISE"" is similar: R, A, I, S, E.\n\nEither is fine.\n\nI\'ll go with ""RAISE"" for my first guess because it has R, A, I, S, E – four vowels? A, I, E are vowels, R and S are consonants. Vowels: A, I, E; consonants: R, S.\n\nIn five letters: positions: 1-R, 2-A, 3-I, 4-S, 5-E.\n\nYes.\n\nI could use ""CRATE"" or ""SLATE"", but ""RAISE"" seems good.\n\nAnother popular one is ""OUIJA"" but that\'s not as common and has U, which might not be optimal.\n\nI think ""RAISE"" or ""SLATE"" are standard.\n\nLet me choose ""RAISE"" for now.\n\nBut the goal is to maximize entropy, meaning that after the guess, the feedback should help reduce the possible word set as much as possible.\n\nBased on studies, words like ""SOARE"" or ""ROATE"" are often recommended, but they are obscure. Better to stick with common words.\n\n""ARISE"" is essentially the same as ""RAISE"", just different starting letter.\n\nI\'ll use ""ARISE"": A, R, I, S, E.\n\nSame letters.\n\nPerhaps ""STEAM"": S, T, E, A, M – includes M, which is medium frequency.\n\nBut ""ARISE"" has higher frequency letters.\n\nE is the most common, then A, R, I, S are all top 10 or so.\n\nLetter frequencies: E is about 12%, T 9%, A 8%, O 7.5%, I 7%, N 7%, S 6.5%, H 6%, R 6%, D 4%, L 4%, etc.\n\n""ARISE"" has A, R, I, S, E – A:8%, R:6%, I:7%, S:6.5%, E:12%. Good coverage.\n\n""SLATE"" has S:6.5%, L:4%, A:8%, T:9%, E:12% – similar, with T instead of I, and L vs R.\n\nT is more common than R or I? T 9% vs R 6%, I 7%, so T is higher.\n\n""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E – L is less common at 4%, while R is 6%. So ""CRATE"" might be better: C: 3%, R:6%, A:8%, T:9%, E:12% – C is lower frequency.\n\nHow about ""TRACE"": T, R, A, C, E – again, C is low.\n\n""STARE"": S, T, A, R, E – S:6.5%, T:9%, A:8%, R:6%, E:12%. All solid.\n\nI think ""STARE"" is slightly better because of higher T frequency.\n\nSimilarly, ""CRANE"" has N instead of T; N is 7%.\n\nBut T is 9%, so ""STARE"" or ""SLATE"".\n\n""SLATE"" has L at 4%, while ""STARE"" has R at 6%, so ""STARE"" has a slightly better average frequency.\n\nI can go with ""STARE"".\n\nBut ""RAISE"" has I at 7% vs L in ""SLATE"" at 4%, so ""RAISE"" might be comparable.\n\nNo real difference; I\'ll pick one.\n\nFor consistency, I\'ll choose ""CRANE"" as it\'s often used, but let\'s decide.\n\nSince I need to output the guess, I\'ll go with ""ARISE"".\n\nBut in the system prompt, it used ""STORM"" as an example, so any valid word is fine.\n\nI think ""ARISE"" is good.\n\nLet me make a choice.\n\nI\'ll use ""SALET"" which is a word, but not common; ""salet"" is historical, may not be known. Better avoid.\n\n""ALERT"" is good: A, L, E, R, T.\n\nBut I think ""ARISE"" is fine.\n\nTo save time, I\'ll go with ""RAISE"".\n\nFinal decision: ""RAISE""\n\nSo for the response, I need to think step by step, then output the guess.\n\nThought process: As this is the first guess with no prior information, I should select a word that contains common letters to maximize the likelihood of getting feedback on frequent vowels and consonants. This helps in narrowing down the possible word list for subsequent guesses. After considering options like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", and ""STARE"", I choose ""RAISE"" as it includes high-frequency letters such as R, A, I, S, and E without any repeats.\n\nThen output in the format.Since this is the first guess, there is no prior feedback to consider. The goal is to choose a starting word that maximizes information gain by including high-frequency letters (vowels and consonants) to narrow down possibilities quickly. After evaluating common options:\n- Vowels like A, E, I are frequent and help identify core word structure.\n- Consonants like R, S are also common and versatile.\nWords like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""STARE"" are often effective, but ""RAISE"" was selected for its balance:\n  - It contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two consonants (R, S), with all letters distinct to avoid ambiguity.\n  - Letter frequencies: R (approx. 6%), A (8%), I (7%), S (6.5%), E (12%) cover a broad range of common English letters.\nThis choice increases the chance of getting useful position or presence feedback to inform later guesses.\n\n<guess>RAISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(✓) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: x (not in the word)\n- I: ✓ (correct position, so the third letter is I)\n- S: x (not in the word)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nSo, from this, we know:\n- The third letter is I.\n- The letters R, A, S, E are not in the word at all.\n- Therefore, the secret word has I as the third letter, and does not contain R, A, S, E.\n\nNow, we need to make a second guess. The guess must be a 5-letter word with I in the third position, and it should avoid using R, A, S, E.\n\nWe also want to use this guess to test other common letters to gather more information.\n\nSince I is fixed at position 3, we have to form a word with the pattern _ _ I _ _\n\nWe should choose letters that are common and not yet tested. From the first guess, we have eliminated R, A, S, E. So we have to avoid these.\n\nCommon letters left: T, O, N, H, L, D, C, U, M, P, etc.\n\nWe should aim to include as many new, common letters as possible in the guess.\n\nPossible words that fit the pattern _ _ I _ _ and don\'t use R, A, S, E:\n\nLet\'s think of some words:\n- With T: e.g., ""POINT"" (P, O, I, N, T) — but we have to check if it avoids R,A,S,E. P, O, I, N, T — yes, none of R,A,S,E.\n- ""BUILT"" (B, U, I, L, T) — avoids R,A,S,E.\n- ""GUILD"" (G, U, I, L, D) — avoids R,A,S,E.\n- ""CHILL"" (C, H, I, L, L) — but has double L, which might not be ideal because it reduces the number of distinct letters. Better to avoid repeats if possible to get more information.\n- ""THING"" (T, H, I, N, G) — avoids R,A,S,E.\n\nWe want to maximize the number of new letters tested.\n\nLetters we haven\'t used: from the first guess we used R,A,I,S,E. So we have I already known, but we are testing other positions.\n\nIn the second guess, we can test T, O, N, H, L, D, C, U, M, P, etc.\n\nLet\'s list the frequency: T (9%), O (7.5%), N (7%), H (6%), L (4%), D (4%), C (3%), U (2.5%), M (2.5%), P (2%), etc.\n\nSo, high frequency: T, O, N, H.\n\nWe should try to include T, O, N, H if possible.\n\nWord with I in the middle and including T, O, N, H.\n\nFor example:\n- ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T — includes O, N, T (and P). P is less common, but O, N, T are good.\n- ""THINK"": T, H, I, N, K — includes T, H, N, K. K is less common, but T, H, N are good.\n- ""LIGHT"": L, I, G, H, T — but I is at position 2, not 3. We need I at position 3.\n- ""NIGHT"": N, I, G, H, T — I is at position 2? N-I-G-H-T, so positions: 1-N, 2-I, 3-G, 4-H, 5-T. But we need I at position 3, so that\'s not it.\n\nWe need the third letter to be I, so pattern: ? ? I ? ?\n\nSo for ""NIGHT"", it\'s N-I-G-H-T, so I is at position 2, not 3.\n\nSimilarly, ""POINT"": P-O-I-N-T, so positions: 1-P, 2-O, 3-I, 4-N, 5-T. Perfect.\n\n""BUILT"": B-U-I-L-T, so 1-B, 2-U, 3-I, 4-L, 5-T.\n\n""GUILD"": G-U-I-L-D, 1-G, 2-U, 3-I, 4-L, 5-D.\n\n""CHILL"": C-H-I-L-L, 1-C, 2-H, 3-I, 4-L, 5-L — but double L, so not ideal.\n\n""THING"": T-H-I-N-G, 1-T, 2-H, 3-I, 4-N, 5-G.\n\n""DOING"": D-O-I-N-G, 1-D, 2-O, 3-I, 4-N, 5-G.\n\n""GOING"": G-O-I-N-G, but has double G? G-O-I-N-G, so 1-G, 2-O, 3-I, 4-N, 5-G — G is repeated, so not good for information.\n\n""JOINT"": J-O-I-N-T — J is rare.\n\n""MOIST"": M-O-I-S-T — but S is eliminated, we cannot use S because S is not in the word (from feedback, S is x, meaning not in word). So we must avoid S.\n\nSimilarly, we must avoid R, A, E as well.\n\nSo ""MOIST"" has S, which is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""POINT"" is good: P-O-I-N-T, no R,A,S,E.\n\n""BUILT"": B-U-I-L-T, no R,A,S,E.\n\n""THING"": T-H-I-N-G, no R,A,S,E.\n\n""DOING"": D-O-I-N-G, no R,A,S,E.\n\n""FLING"": F-L-I-N-G, no R,A,S,E.\n\n""CLING"": C-L-I-N-G, etc.\n\nNow, among these, which one has the most common letters? ""POINT"" has O, N, T which are high frequency. P is less common, but it\'s acceptable.\n\n""THING"" has T, H, N, G — H and N are good, G is medium.\n\n""DOING"" has O, N, G — O and N are high.\n\nBut ""POINT"" has O, N, T — T is the most common consonant.\n\nWe also want to cover different letters to test more.\n\nSince we know I is in the word and at position 3, we don\'t need to test I again, but we can use it to form the word.\n\nIn the feedback, for the second guess, we will get information about the other positions.\n\nI think ""POINT"" is a good choice: it tests P, O, N, T in positions 1,2,4,5, and we know position 3 is I.\n\nSimilarly, ""THING"" tests T, H, N, G.\n\nBut ""POINT"" might be better because O and T are very common.\n\nAnother word: ""JOINT"" but J is rare.\n\n""MOUNT"": M-O-U-N-T — but U is less common, and we have I at position 3? M-O-U-N-T has U at position 3, not I. We need I at position 3.\n\n""POINT"" seems solid.\n\n""BUILT"" has U, which is less common, but it\'s okay.\n\nI think ""POINT"" is a standard word.\n\nWe could use ""BLIND"": B-L-I-N-D — but L and D are medium, and we avoid R,A,S,E.\n\nBut ""POINT"" has higher frequency letters.\n\nLet\'s compare the frequency sum for the new letters:\n\nFor ""POINT"": P (2%), O (7.5%), N (7%), T (9%) — but we are testing positions 1,2,4,5. Position 3 is I, which we already know, so we don\'t get new info about I, but we use it to form the word.\n\nThe feedback will tell us about P, O, N, T.\n\nSimilarly for ""THING"": T (9%), H (6%), N (7%), G (2%) — T and N are high, H medium, G low.\n\n""POINT"" has O and T high, N high, P low.\n\nO is 7.5%, T 9%, N 7%, P 2% — average better than ""THING"" which has G at 2%.\n\n""DOING"": D (4%), O (7.5%), N (7%), G (2%) — D and G lower.\n\nSo ""POINT"" seems best.\n\nAnother word: ""PRINT"" — but P-R-I-N-T, R is eliminated, we cannot use R. R is not in the word, so avoid.\n\nSimilarly, ""TRAIN"" has R and A, both eliminated.\n\nSo ""POINT"" is good.\n\n""JOINT"" has J, which is very rare.\n\n""QUINT"" has Q and U, Q is rare.\n\nSo I think ""POINT"" is a reasonable choice.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""POINT"" for the second guess.\n\nThought process: Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"", we know that the third letter is \'I\' and that \'R\', \'A\', \'S\', \'E\' are not in the word. Therefore, the second guess must have \'I\' in the third position and avoid using the letters R, A, S, E. The goal is to test new common letters to gather more information. After considering words like ""THING"", ""BUILT"", and ""DOING"", ""POINT"" was selected because it includes high-frequency letters O, N, T (and P) in distinct positions, maximizing the potential for useful feedback on letter presence and position.\n\n<guess>POINT</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- The third letter is ""I"" and in the correct position (✓).\n- The letters ""R"", ""A"", ""S"", and ""E"" are not in the word at all (x).\n\nFor the second guess:\n- The word must have ""I"" as the third letter (position 3).\n- It must avoid using the letters R, A, S, or E.\n- To maximize information gain, I should prioritize common unused letters (e.g., T, O, N, L, C, H) and avoid repeating letters to test more possibilities.\n\nAfter evaluating options:\n- ""POINT"" fits the criteria: it has ""I"" in position 3, avoids R/A/S/E, and tests new high-frequency letters (T, O, N) and the less common P. This provides broad coverage to narrow down the word list effectively.\n\n<guess>POINT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(✓) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(✓) N(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n- Guess 1: RAISE -> R(x), A(x), I(✓), S(x), E(x) → I is correct and in position 3; R, A, S, E not in word.\n- Guess 2: POINT -> P(x), O(x), I(✓), N(x), T(x) → I is still ✓ in position 3 (which we knew), and P, O, N, T not in word.\n\nSo now we know:\n- The third letter is I. No change.\n- Additional letters not in the word: P, O, N, T (from POINT), plus R, A, S, E (from RAISE). So total absent letters: R, A, S, E, P, O, N, T.\n\nLetters that could be in the word: from the alphabet, subtract the absent ones.\n\nAbsent: A, E, I? Wait, I is in the word, so I is present but we already know its position.\n\nKnown present: I (at position 3).\n\nAbsent: R, A, S, E, P, O, N, T.\n\nPossible remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we need common English letters, so likely consonants and possibly U or Y as vowels.\n\nSince no other letters have been confirmed present yet except I, we must consider that the word has other letters from the remaining pool.\n\nThe word pattern is _ _ I _ _ (5 letters, third is I).\n\nWe have used letters: from RAISE: R,A,I,S,E and POINT: P,O,I,N,T. I is repeated, but we knew that.\n\nSo letters tested and absent: A,E,P,O,N,T,R,S. That\'s 8 letters plus E which is already included? List: A, E, R, S, P, O, N, T.\n\nAbsent: A, E, R, S, P, O, N, T.\n\nPossible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I? I is already in and we know position, so for other positions, we need to guess from letters not absent, excluding I since it\'s fixed at position 3 but can be used elsewhere? No, I is fixed at position 3, but could it be elsewhere? The feedback only shows that position 3 is I, but it doesn\'t preclude other I\'s. For example, in ""CIVIC"", I can appear multiple times.\n\nBut in guess 1, we had I as ✓, but the other positions had E, which was absent, so E is not in the word, but I could be duplicate? Let\'s see the feedback.\n\nFor RAISE: I(✓) means the letter in position 3 is correct (I). The other positions: R(x) means R is not in the word at all, similarly A(x), S(x), E(x) mean A, S, E not in word. But it doesn\'t say anything about additional I\'s. Similarly for POINT, P(x), O(x), N(x), T(x) mean no P,O,N,T in word, and I(✓) confirms position 3 I.\n\nBut since position 3 is I, and no other I was guessed in positions 1,2,4,5, it doesn\'t tell us if there could be another I. For example, the word could have I at position 3 and say at position 1, but since we didn\'t guess I elsewhere, we don\'t know.\n\nIn RAISE, position 4 is S, which was absent, but if we had guessed a word with I in other positions, it might show -, but we haven\'t. So possibly, the word could have multiple I\'s.\n\nBut with only I confirmed, we need to guess words with other letters.\n\nNow, from remaining letters: common ones are B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, U, W, Y.\n\nVowels: we have U and possibly Y as semi-vowel, but vowels in English are A,E,I,O,U – A,E,O are absent, so U is the only vowel left besides I? But Y can be vowel too.\n\nSo possible vowels: I, U, Y.\n\nBut I is fixed at position 3, so other positions should have consonants or U/Y.\n\nPossible words: pattern _ _ I _ _\n\nLetters to use from: B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. But J,Q,X,Z are low frequency, so focus on B,C,D,F,G,H,L,M,U,W,Y.\n\nFor this guess, we want to test more common letters to find which are present.\n\nCommon unused: L, H, D, U, C, M, etc.\n\nSo we should construct a word with I at position 3, using letters not eliminated.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Words with L: e.g., ""GUIL D"" but D is possible, and we have to avoid absent letters. G,U,I,L,D – no A,E,R,S,P,O,N,T.\n\n""GUILD"" is a word? Yes, GUILD.\n\nSimilarly, ""BUILD"" – B,U,I,L,D – same idea.\n\n""CLIMB"" – C,L,I,M,B – and M is possible.\n\n""FLICK"" – F,L,I,C,K – K possible.\n\n""THICK"" but T and H: T is absent, so no, T cannot be used.\n\nT is absent, from POINT feedback T(x), so avoid T.\n\nSimilarly O,N,P absent.\n\nSo letters to avoid: A,E,R,S,P,O,N,T.\n\nLetters to use: B,C,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. High frequency: C, D, F, G, H, L, M.\n\nNow, possible words:\n\nWith U: since it\'s a vowel, might be good to test.\n\ne.g., ""QUICK"" but Q is uncommon, and we have U,I,C,K.\n\n""BUILD"": B,U,I,L,D\n\n""GUILT"" but T absent, so no.\n\n""GUILD"" is good.\n\n""FLUID"": F,L,U,I,D – avoids absent letters.\n\n""CLUMP"" but P absent? P is absent, yes.\n\nP absent, so cannot use P.\n\n""JUICE"" but E absent? E is absent, so no.\n\n""DUCHY"" – D,U,C,H,Y – all valid? D,U,C,H,Y not absent.\n\nY is possible.\n\nAnother word: ""LUCKY"" – L,U,C,K,Y – but position 3 must be I? Pattern must have I at position 3, so ""LUCKY"" is L-U-C-K-Y, no I, so not acceptable. Must have I at position 3.\n\nSo only words with I in the middle.\n\n""QUILT"" but T absent, no.\n\n""BUILD"": B(1), U(2), I(3), L(4), D(5) – BUILD is a word.\n\n""GUILD"": G(1), U(2), I(3), L(4), D(5) – same as BUILD with G.\n\n""FLUID"": F(1), L(2), U(3)? Wait no, FLUID is F-L-U-I-D, positions: 1-F, 2-L, 3-U? But we need I at position 3. F-L-U-I-D has U at position 3, I at position 4. We need position 3 to be I.\n\nSo must be ? ? I ? ?, so first two letters, then I, then last two.\n\nSo ""BUILD"" is B-U-I-L-D, so 1-B,2-U,3-I,4-L,5-D. Good.\n\n""GUILD"" similarly G-U-I-L-D.\n\n""CLINK"": C-L-I-N-K but N absent, N is eliminated, so cannot use N.\n\nFrom POINT, N(x), so absent.\n\nSimilarly ""BLIMP"" has P, absent.\n\n""CHILD"": C-H-I-L-D – avoids absent letters? H,L,C,D possible.\n\nC-H-I-L-D: positions 1-C,2-H,3-I,4-L,5-D.\n\nSimilarly ""MILD"": M-I-L-D but I at position 2? M-I-L-D has only four positions? Must be five letters.\n\n""MILKY"": M-I-L-K-Y, position 1-M,2-I, then 3-L, but we need position 3 to be I, not L. So it must be I at 3.\n\n""CHILL"": C-H-I-L-L, but double L, repeats, reduces information.\n\nBetter to avoid repeats if possible.\n\n""GRIMY"": G-R-I-M-Y but R absent, cannot use R.\n\nR is absent.\n\n""WHINY"": W-H-I-N-Y but N absent.\n\nSo possible options without repeats: ""BUILD"", ""GUILD"", ""CHILD"", ""FILMY"" (but FILMY has Y, meaning covered with film), F-I-L-M-Y? Positions: 1-F,2-I? Not 3-I.\n\nWe need position 3 to be I.\n\n""CHILD"": C-H-I-L-D, perfect.\n\n""FIELD"": F-I-E-L-D but E absent? E is absent, from RAISE, E(x), so cannot use E.\n\nSo ""FIELD"" invalid.\n\n""YIELD"": Y-I-E-L-D, has E, absent.\n\nNo.\n\n""GUILT"" has T, absent.\n\nSo back to ""BUILD"", ""GUILD"", ""CHILD"".\n\n""CIVIC"": C-I-V-I-C, has I at position 2 and 4, but position 3 is V? Position: 1-C,2-I,3-V,4-I,5-C. Position 3 is V, not I. So not I at 3.\n\nWe must have I at position 3.\n\n""VALID"": V-A-L-I-D but A absent, no.\n\nSo ""CHILD"": C,H,I,L,D – letters C,H,L,D possible.\n\n""BUILD"": B,U,I,L,D\n\n""GUILD"": G,U,I,L,D\n\n""FLUID"": F-L-U-I-D, position 3 is U? F-L-U-I-D, so 1=F,2=L,3=U,4=I,5=D. Position 3 is U, not I. So only if position 3 is I.\n\nWhat about ""QUIET""? Q-U-I-E-T, but E and T absent, no.\n\n""QUILL"" double L, and position? Q-U-I-L-L, positions 1-Q,2-U,3-I,4-L,5-L. So it has I at 3.\n\nBut double L repeats.\n\nBetter to avoid if possible.\n\n""SKIMP"" S absent? S is absent.\n\nWe have U for vowel or Y.\n\nAnother word: ""CLIMB"": C-L-I-M-B, that could work: C,L,I,M,B.\n\n""MOLDY"" no I.\n\n""CHIME"": C-H-I-M-E, E absent.\n\nNo.\n\n""WHILE"" W-H-I-L-E, E absent.\n\nSo back to: ""CHILD"", ""BUILD"", ""GUILD"", or ""JUICE"" but E absent, not.\n\n""BLUID""? Not a word.\n\nPerhaps ""FLUID"" cannot because position 3 not I.\n\nUnless it\'s spelled F-L-U-I-D, but L-U-I, position 3 U, not I.\n\nStandard spelling, position varies.\n\nAnother word: ""BRICK"" B-R-I-C-K, but R absent.\n\nR is gone.\n\n""PRICK"" P and R absent.\n\n""THICK"" T absent.\n\nSo available: ""CHILD"" seems good: C-H-I-L-D.\n\n""CHILL"" double L.\n\n""GUIDE"" G-U-I-D-E, E absent.\n\n""QUICK"" Q-U-I-C-K, that is Q-U-I-C-K, positions 1-Q,2-U,3-I,4-C,5-K. So it has I at 3.\n\nSimilarly, ""QUACK"" no I.\n\nSo ""QUICK"" is an option, but Q is uncommon, so might not be the secret word, but it could be.\n\nBut we want to test common letters.\n\n""QUICK"": Q,U,I,C,K – letters Q,U,C,K.\n\nQ and K are less common, U and C medium.\n\nCompared to ""CHILD"": C,H,L,D – C,H,L,D more common than Q,U,C,K? C is in both, H,L,D vs U,K,Q.\n\nH is 6%, L 4%, D 4%, U 2.5%, K 1%, Q very low.\n\nSo ""CHILD"" tests H,L,D which are better than U,K,Q.\n\nBut ""QUICK"" tests U and C.\n\nSince C is common, testing it might be good.\n\nBut let\'s see another option.\n\n""BUILD"": B,U,I,L,D – B low frequency, U medium, L,D medium.\n\nSimilarly ""GUILD"": G,U,I,L,D – G low.\n\n""CHILD"": C,H,I,L,D – C,H,L,D all medium frequency.\n\nC:3%, H:6%, L:4%, D:4%.\n\nNot bad.\n\n""DWARF"" no I.\n\nPerhaps ""CHIMY"" not a word.\n\nI think ""CHILD"" or ""BUILD"" are fine.\n\nAlso, with U, we can use ""BUILD"" to test U.\n\nU is the only vowel possibility left besides Y, so it might be important to test it.\n\nIn ""BUILD"", U is at position 2.\n\nSimilarly in ""CHILD"", H is at position 2.\n\nBoth are consonants? H is consonant, U is vowel.\n\nSince we lack vowel information, testing U might be valuable.\n\nFor example, if U is present, we get more clues.\n\nIf not, we eliminate it.\n\nSimilarly for Y.\n\nBut Y is less common.\n\nSo perhaps ""BUILD"" to test U.\n\n""GUILD"" same.\n\nOr ""QUICK"", but Q is rare.\n\nLet\'s decide.\n\nPerhaps a word like ""LYMPH"" no I.\n\nAnother one: ""WIMPY"" W-I-M-P-Y, position 3 not I.\n\nNot.\n\nSo between ""CHILD"" and ""BUILD"", I\'ll choose ""CHILD"" because it avoids U which might be less necessary, but U could be key.\n\nSince A,E,O are absent, U might be in the word or not.\n\nAt this point, with few guesses left, we need to be efficient.\n\nPerhaps list possible words.\n\nThe secret word has I at position 3, no R,A,S,E,P,O,N,T.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- With C: CHILD, CHINK? But N absent, CHINK has N which is absent? CHINK has N, but N absent.\n\nFrom POINT, N(x), so N absent.\n\nSo CHILD is good.\n\nFLUID not, position wrong.\n\nGUILD good.\n\nBLIND: B-L-I-N-D, N absent, no.\n\nBUILD good.\n\nCLIMB: C-L-I-M-B, good.\n\nDUTCH: D-U-T-C-H, T absent.\n\nInvalid.\n\nLUCK: not 5 letters.\n\nJUMBO: no I.\n\nSo shortlist:\n\n- BUILD (B,U,I,L,D)\n\n- GUILD (G,U,I,L,D)\n\n- CHILD (C,H,I,L,D)\n\n- CLIMB (C,L,I,M,B)\n\n- JUICE? J,U,I,C,E but E absent.\n\nNot.\n\nQUICK (Q,U,I,C,K)\n\n But Q and K uncommon.\n\nOther words like: PHYLC not a word.\n\nMYTHIC not 5 letters.\n\nSo realistic: BUILD, GUILD, CHILD, CLIMB.\n\nCLIMB has B, which is low freq, but possible.\n\nTo maximize new letters, let\'s see what each tests.\n\nFor example:\n- BUILD: tests B,U,L,D\n- GUILD: tests G,U,L,D\n- CHILD: tests C,H,L,D\n- CLIMB: tests C,L,M,B\n\nAll test L and one more consonant plus U or not.\n\nIn CHILD, H is tested, in BUILD U is tested.\n\nSince U is a vowel possibility, it might be worth testing.\n\nMoreover, U is more common than H? H: 6%, U: 2.5%, so H is more common, but U as vowel may be critical.\n\nPerhaps ""FIC us"" not a word.\n\n""BLUID"" not standard.\n\nI think both are fine.\n\nPerhaps choose ""BUILD"" to check if U is present.\n\nBut let\'s set the strategy.\n\nWe have only one letter known, so we need to find the other four.\n\nAfter this guess, we will get feedback.\n\nSo for this turn, guess one of these.\n\nI\'ll go with ""CHILD"" for now.\n\nBut CHILD has H and L, etc.\n\nAnother word: ""MILCH"" M-I-L-C-H, position 2 I? Must be position 3 I.\n\nNot.\n\n""WICCA"" no I.\n\nSo I think ""CHILD"" is reasonable.\n\nOr ""BLIMP"" but P absent.\n\nNo.\n\n""GRIMY"" G-R-I-M-Y, R absent.\n\nSo CHILD it is.\n\nBut we can think of frequency.\n\nMost common remaining letters: C, H, D, L, U, M, etc.\n\nC has 3%, L 4%, H 6%, D 4%, U 2.5%, M 2.5%.\n\nAverage.\n\nPerhaps ""CLIMB"" tests M.\n\nBut BUILD tests U.\n\nLet\'s see if there is a word with multiple high frequency.\n\nFor example, ""CULLY"" but U and L I position? C-U-L-L-Y, position 3 L, not I.\n\nNot.\n\n""DILLY"" D-I-L-L-Y, position 2 I.\n\nNot.\n\n""GILLY"" similar.\n\nI think ""CHILD"" or ""BUILD"" are the way to go.\n\nI\'ll choose ""CHILD"" to test H and C.\n\nSo guess: CHILD\n\nThought process: Based on accumulated feedback:\n- Position 3 is ""I"".\n- Absent letters: R, A, S, E, P, O, N, T.\n- The second guess ""POINT"" ruled out P, O, N, T aside from confirming position 3.\nFor the third guess, we need a 5-letter word with ""I"" at position 3, using only untested letters from the remaining pool (B,C,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,U,W,Y,Z). Priority is to test common consonants like C, L, H, D and vowel U.\nAfter considering options such as ""BUILD"", ""GUILD"", ""CLIMB"", and ""QUICK"", ""CHILD"" is selected because it contains high-utility letters C, H, L, D (all distinct and reasonably common), avoiding rare letters and focusing on likely consonants. If ""CHILD"" is incorrect, the feedback willprovide new presence/absence information for C, H, L, D and their positions.\n\n<guess>CHILD</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- Guess 1 ""RAISE"": I is correct and in position 3; R, A, S, E are absent.\n- Guess 2 ""POINT"": I is still correct in position 3; P, O, N, T are absent.\n- Total absent letters: A, E, R, S, P, O, N, T.  \n- Position 3 is confirmed as ""I"".  \n- Available letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, W, Y (common English letters from remaining pool).  \n\nFor the third guess:  \n- Must have ""I"" in position 3 (pattern: _ _ I _ _).  \n- Avoid all absent letters.  \n- Prioritize testing high-frequency unused letters like C, L, H, D, U to maximize information gain.  \n- Words evaluated:  \n  - ""BUILD"" (tests B, U, L, D) – good for U (vowel test), but U less common.  \n  - ""GUILD"" (tests G, U, L, D) – similar, G low frequency.  \n  - ""CLIMB"" (tests C, L, M, B) – adds M but weak vowel coverage.  \n  - ""CHILD"" (tests C, H, L, D) – optimal: C, H, L, D are high-value consonant tests; all letters distinct and moderate frequency.  \n\n**Selected ""CHILD""**: Tests C, H, L, D—common letters not yet examined—and uses position 3 ""I"".

No, the word has other positions.\n\nThe secret word has C in it, but not at position 1, and possibly at position 2,4, or 5.\n\nBut in CHILD, position 2 was H, which is absent, so not C there? Not necessarily, because C could be in position 2, but we guessed H at pos 2, so if C were at pos 2, it would have shown differently.\n\nIn CHILD, we guessed:\nPos1: C → feedback (-) meaning C is in word but not here. So C is not at position 1.\nPos2: H → feedback (x) meaning H not in word at all.\nPos3: I → (✓) correct.\nPos4: L → (x) L not in word.\nPos5: D → (x) D not in word.\n\nSo C is in the word, but since the feedback for pos1 is (-), C must be in one of the other positions: 2,4, or 5.\n\nBut position 2: we guessed H, not C, so if C were at position 2, the feedback for position 2 would be (-) or (✓), but since we guessed H and H is absent, it\'s (x), so nothing about C being at pos 2. Similarly for other positions.\n\nC could be at position 2,4, or 5.\n\nFor example, if C is at position 2, but we didn\'t guess C at position 2; we guessed H, which was wrong. So the feedback doesn\'t tell us which other position C is at.\n\nWe need to guess a word that has C at possible positions and I at position 3, and avoids absent letters.\n\nAbsent letters: A,E,R,S,P,O,N,T,H,L,D.\n\nSo remaining possible letters: B,F,G,J,K,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. And from previous, C is present, I is present at pos 3.\n\nC must be in the word, so in positions 2,4, or 5.\n\nAlso, possible vowels: only U or Y, since A,E,I,O absent? I is present, O absent, A,E absent.\n\nVowel possibilities: U, or sometimes Y.\n\nBut I is already in.\n\nSo for other positions, we need to use letters from remaining.\n\nPossible words with C in the word at different positions and I at position 3.\n\nFirst, list letters to use: available letters include B,F,G,J,K,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z, and C is for sure.\n\nBut C must be placed.\n\nNow, common letters left: F,G,K,M,U,W,Y.\n\nLow frequency: J,Q,V,X,Z.\n\nAvoid repeats if possible.\n\nPattern: ? ? I ? ?\n\nC must be in position 2,4, or 5.\n\nSo cases:\n\n- If C is position 2: pattern _ C I _ _\n- If C is position 4: pattern _ _ I C _\n- If C is position 5: pattern _ _ I _ C\n\nWe need to guess a word that fits one of these and uses other new letters to test.\n\nFor example, if C is at position 4, word like _ _ I C _\n\nBut what words?\n\nSimilarly for other positions.\n\nSince we don\'t know where C is, we need to guess a word that covers multiple possibilities.\n\nBut with the constraints, few words exist.\n\nMoreover, we have to avoid absent letters.\n\nPossible words with I at position 3 and C somewhere else.\n\nFor example:\n\n- If C at position 2: pattern _ C I _ _\n  Example words: ""UCIFI"" not word, ""ACID"" but A absent, no. Absent letters.\n  Available: so position 1: must be letter not absent, like F,G,U,K,etc.\n  And position 4 and 5.\n  So possible "" F C I K "" with K not good.\n  "" F C I E D "" E absent.\n  Hard to find.\n  "" U C I K Y "" not word.\n\nI am considering real words.\n\nShortlist possible words given constraints.\n\nRemember, the word must be valid English 5-letter word.\n\nWith I at position 3, C in the word not at position 1, and absent letters avoided.\n\nPossible positions for C:\n\nFirst, C could be at position 4: e.g., words like ? ? I C ?\n\nPosition 4 C.\n\nFor example, ""MUSIC"" is M-U-S-I-C, but S isabsent and position 4 S? Wait, ""MUSIC"" positions:1-M,2-U,3-S,4-I? But we need position 3 to be I, here position 4 is I? Not.\n\nPattern must be position 3 I.\n\nFor position 4: C, pattern _ _ I C _\n\nSo letters 4: C.\n\nWords ending with C? But rarely, except like ""MUSIC"" but wrong I position.\n\n"" COMIC "" C-O-M-I-C but O absent and C not position 4? Positions:1-C,2-O,3-M,4-I,5-C — no, position 3 M not I.\n\nIf we have _ _ I C _, e.g., ""BICEP"" B-I-C-E-P but E and P absent, and I at position 2? B-I-C-E-P:1-B,2-I,3-C,4-E,5-P.\n\nNot position 3 I.\n\nWe need first two letters, then I at 3, then C at 4, then last letter.\n\nFor example, word like ""CUBIC"" but C at start? ""CUBIC"" C-U-B-I-C, positions:1-C,2-U,3-B? Not I. Position 3 B.\n\nNot.\n\n""MEDIC"" M-E-D-I-C, E absent and positions:1-M,2-E,3-D,4-I,5-C — position 4 I, not 3.\n\nHard to find words with I at position 3 and C at position 4.\n\nWith C at position 5: pattern _ _ I _ C\n\nWord ending with C and I at position 3.\n\nFor example, ""JUICY"" J-U-I-C-Y, positions:1-J,2-U,3-I,4-C,5-Y — yes, position 3 I, and position 4 C, position 5 Y.\n\nNot C at position 5.\n\nPosition 5 C.\n\n_JUICY has position 4 C or position 5 Y.\n\n""TONIC"" T-O-N-I-C, T,O,N absent.\n\n""MANIC"" M-A-N-I-C, A,N absent.\n\n"" PANIC "" P-A-N-I-C, P,A,N absent.\n\n""GENIC"" G-E-N-I-C, E,N absent.\n\n""LYRIC"" L-Y-R-I-C, L absent? L is absent from CHILD L(x), so L absent. And R absent.\n\nNot.\n\n""MYCIC"" not word.\n\n""CIVIC"" C-I-V-I-C, but position 3 V? C-I-V-I-C:1-C,2-I,3-V,4-I,5-C. Position 3 V not I.\n\nSo rare.\n\nNow, other position, C at position 2: pattern _ C I _ _\n\nFor example, ""AC ID"" not, absent letters.\n"" U C I F Y "" not word.\n"" S C I F I "" not.\n\nSimilarly, ""ECLIPSE"" too many letters.\n\nI think there are few options.\n\nPerhaps C at position 4 or 5 is difficult.\n\nMaybe C is at position 2.\n\nFor instance, ""UCK IN"" not word.\n\nAnother idea: words like ""CYKES"" not common.\n\nPerhaps ""WHICH"" W-H-I-C-H, but H absent, and position 3 I, position 4 C? ""WHICH"" 1-W,2-H,3-I,4-C,5-H — H absent, so invalid.\n\nBut H is absent.\n\nSimilarly, "" PICKY "" P-I-C-K-Y, P absent and I at position 2? Not.\n\nPosition 3 I: ""  P I C K Y "" no.\n\nWe need position 3 I.\n\nList all possible words from the remaining letters.\n\nAvailable letters: B,F,G,J,K,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z and C must be in.\n\nWith pattern _ _ I _ _\n\nAnd C in 2,4, or 5.\n\nFor example:\n- Position 2 C: so word like X C I Y Z, where Y and Z are other letters.\n  Position 1: say B, F, G, K, M, U, W, Y? But Y can be consonant.\n  Position 4 and 5: similar.\n\nWords: ""BCI"" not word.\n\n""CIGAR"" C at start, but position wrong.\n\nI think we have to accept that C might be at position 5 or 4.\n\nAnother common word: ""MUCKI"" not 5 letters.\n\n""QUICK"" we thought earlier, but QUICK is Q-U-I-C-K, positions 1-Q,2-U,3-I,4-C,5-K.\n\nSo it has position 3 I, and C at position 4.\n\nC is at position 4, and Q,U,K.\n\nQ and K are available? Absent letters don\'t include Q,U,K.\n\nFrom feedback, no Q,U,K eliminated yet.\n\nSimilarly, ""QUICK"" avoids absent letters: Q,U,C,K are all possible, and I at 3.\n\nAlso, U is a vowel candidate.\n\nBut Q is low frequency, but possible.\n\nFeedback from CHILD: C(-) , which means C is in the word but not at position 1, and in QUICK, position 4 C, so U at position 2, etc.\n\nAnother word: ""CIVIC"" not position 3 I.\n\n""JUICY"" is J-U-I-C-Y, which has position 3 I, position 4 C, position 5 Y.\n\nY possible.\n\n""JUICY"" might work, J,U,C,Y.\n\nC at position 4.\n\nOr ""GUICY"" not word.\n\n""BUICK"" not word.\n\nSo possible words: ""QUICK"", ""JUICY"", etc.\n\n""QUICK"" is valid.\n\nFor C at position 5: ""  ... I .. C "" like ""VODIC"" not word, ""LOGIC"" L,O absent.\n\nNot.\n\nSo probably ""QUICK"" or ""JUICY"".\n\n""QUICK"" tests Q,U,C,K and C is already known present, but we can get positions.\n\nSimilarly, ""JUICY"" tests J,U,C,Y.\n\nBoth U and Y vowel possibilities.\n\nPerhaps ""QUICK"" to test U.\n\nWe also have other letters to test.\n\nBut we have to guess a word.\n\nAnother option: since C is present and at position 2,4, or 5, we can guess a word with C in multiple positions or different.\n\nFor example, ""CUBIC"" has C at 1 and 5, position 3 not I.\n\nNot.\n\n"" C I V I C "" position 2 I not 3.\n\nNot.\n\nI think the most common is ""QUICK"".\n\nLetters: Q,U,I,C,K.\n\nQ and K uncommon, but U is valuable.\n\n""BUICK"" not word.\n\nOr ""CLICK"" but L absent, L eliminated.\n\nL absent.\n\nSo no.\n\n""KICKS"" K-I-C-K-S, S absent and position 2 I not.\n\nNot.\n\nSo ""QUICK"" or similar.\n\n"" CHICK"" C at position 1, but H absent, invalid.\n\nH absent.\n\nSo ""QUICK"" seems viable.\n\n""QUAFF"" no I.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""QUICK"".\n\nBut position of C is at position 4, which one possibility.\n\nFeedback will give us positions.\n\nAnother word: ""JUICE"" but E absent, not.\n\n""YICKS"" not.\n\nSo ""QUICK"" is a option.\n\n""QUIFF"" Q-U-I-F-F, so position 3 I, position 4 F, position 5 F, double F.\n\nNot great.\n\n""QUIMS"" no.\n\nSo ""QUICK"" is better.\n\nPerhaps ""UMIAC"" not common.\n\nI think we have to choose ""QUICK"".\n\nBut let\'s think of the feedback.\n\nIf we guess ""QUICK"", positions:1-Q,2-U,3-I,4-C,5-K\n\nFeedback will tell:\n- Q: if correct or present\n- U: similarly\n- I: correct at position 3\n- C: at position 4, which might be correct or wrong position\n- K: etc.\n\nBut C is present, so if at position 4 is wrong, it must be elsewhere, but since we guess it at 4, if (✓) then good, if (-) then it is at other position.\n\nSimilarly for Q,U,K.\n\nWith only 3 guesses left, we can risk.\n\nBut another word: with U and Y.\n\nFor example, ""YUCCA"" Y-U-C-C-A, A absent and position not I.\n\nNo.\n\n""MYCIN"" not word.\n\nSo I think ""QUICK"" or ""JUICY"".\n\n""JUICY"": J,U,I,C,Y\n\nJ less common than Q? Q slightly more than J.\n\nBut similar.\n\nPosition 3 I, position 4 C, position 5 Y.\n\nIn feedback, for CHILD, C at position 1 was (-), so C is elsewhere, but not necessarily at position 4; it could be at position 2 or 5.\n\nIn ""JUICY"", if we guess, position 4 is C, so if C is at position 4, it would be (✓) or (-).\n\nBut if C is at position 5, for example, then guessing at position 4 might be (x) or (-), but since C is present, it would be (-) if wrong position.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nTo test if C is at position 2, we could guess a word with C at position 2.\n\nFew examples: ""FCKED"" not a word.\n\n""UCKER"" not.\n\n""BCI"" not.\n\n""MCGUI"" not.\n\nI think it\'s hard, so perhaps assume C is not at position 2, position 2 could be U or something.\n\nAnother possible word: ""BUICK"" not, or ""QUILT"" T absent.\n\nNot.\n\nI think ""QUICK"" is the best choice.\n\nLet\'s go with ""QUICK"".\n\nBut we need a word, so guess ""QUICK"".\n\nThought process for response:\n\nFrom CHILD feedback, C is present but not at position 1, so it must be in one of positions 2, 4, or 5. However, positions 2 and 4 were guessed as H and L in CHILD, but H and L are absent, so C cannot be at position 2 or 4 because if it were, it would have been indicated in CHILD feedback? No, in CHILD, position 2 was H, not C, so if C is at position 2, the feedback for position 2 wouldn\'t show C because we didn\'t guess C there; we guessed H. So C could be at position 2, and we wouldn\'t know.\n\nSimilarly for position 4, we guessed L, not C.\n\nPosition 5 guessed D.\n\nSo C could be at position 2,4, or 5.\n\nFor example, if C is at position 2, the secret word has C there, but we guessed H, so it showed (x) for H.\n\nNothing about C at position 2.\n\nPosition position.\n\nSo C can be at position 2,4, or 5.\n\nWith that in mind, for the fourth guess, we want to guess a word that places C in a possible position and uses other letter to test.\n\n""QUICK"" has C at position 4, so if C is at position 4, it will be (✓) or if not, (-) if elsewhere, or we will know.\n\nSimilarly, it also tests Q,U,K.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""QUICK"".\n\nTherefore, guess ""QUICK"".\n\nIn the response, include thought process.\n\nThought process: Based on feedback from ""CHILD"", C is present in the secret word but not at position 1. With positions 2, 4, and 5 being possibilities for C, and given the absence of 11 letters (A,E,H,L,D,R,S,P,O,N,T), the remaining letters include F,G,J,K,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. The guess must hI at position 3 and incorporate C somewhere else. Words like ""QUICK"" (Q,U,I,C,K) fit and test the vowel candidate U and consonant K. Although Q and K are uncommon, this guess efficiently checks if C is at position 4 and provides new informatU and K.\n\n<guess>QUICK</guess>Based on the accumulated feedback:\n- Position 3 is confirmed as ""I"".\n- C is present in the word but not at position 1 (feedback: C(-)).\n- Absent letters: A, E, R, S, P, O, N, T, H, L, D (from all previous feedback).\n- Remaining possible letters: B, F, G, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nFor the fourth guess:\n- Must have ""I"" at position 3 (pattern: _ _ I _ _).\n- Must include C (per feedback), but C cannot be at position 1. C could be at position 2, 4, or 5.\n- Avoid all absent letters.\n- Prioritize testing high-frequency unused letters like U (potential vowel), K, and M to maximize information gain.\n- Evaluated words:\n  - ""QUICK"": Tests Q, U, C at position 4, K. Covers U (critical vowel test) and positions for C. Downside: Q less common.\n  - ""JUICY"": Tests J, U, C, Y. J/Y low frequency.\n  - ""QUIFF"" or ""QUIMS"": Invalid due to double letters or absent S.\n  - Other options sparse due to constraints.\n\n""QUICK"" was selected to validate if C is at position 4 (high probability based on common word structures), test the vowel candidate U, and introduce K—a useful consonant. Feedback will clarify C position and U/K presence, reducing possibilities significantly.\n\n<guess>QUICK</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(✓) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(✓) N(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: CHILD -> FEEDBACK: C(-) H(x) I(✓) L(x) D(x)\nGuess 4: QUICK -> FEEDBACK: Q(x) U(✓) I(✓) C(✓) K(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have new feedback from the fourth guess ""QUICK"":
- Q(x): Q is not in the word
- U(✓): U is in the word and in the correct position (position 2)
- I(✓): I is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, already known)
- C(✓): C is in the word and in the correct position (position 4)
- K(x): K is not in the word

So now we know:
- Position 2 is U (new information)
- Position 3 is I (known)
- Position 4 is C (new)
- Q and K are not in the word.

Also, from previous feedback, we have:
- Position 3 is I.
- C is present and now we know it's at position 4.
- U is present and at position 2.

Additionally, absent letters: from all previous:
- RAISE: R, A, S, E absent
- POINT: P, O, N, T absent
- CHILD: H, L, D absent
- QUICK: Q, K absent

So total absent: A, E, R, S, P, O, N, T, H, L, D, Q, K.

Present letters: U (pos2), I (pos3), C (pos4), and one more letter to find at position 1 and position 5.

The word pattern is: _ U I C _

We need to find the first and last letters.

Position 1 and 5 are missing.

Letters available: from the alphabet, subtract absent letters.

Absent: A, E, R, S, P, O, N, T, H, L, D, Q, K.

Remaining possible letters: B, F, G, J, M, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we need to form a valid English word.

The word must be of the form ? U I C ?

With ? being one of the remaining letters.

Possible words:

- First, position 1: can be B, F, G, J, M, V, W, X, Y, Z
- Position 5: similarly

But it must be a valid word.

Common possibilities:

- ""MUSIC"" but S is absent, and position: M-U-S-I-C, but S is absent and position 4 is I? Not, pattern is U at 2, I at 3, C at 4, so ? U I C ?

""MUSIC"" has U at 2, I at 4? Not.

"" CUBIC "" C at 1, but C is at position 4, not 1.

Not.

""LOGIC"" L and O absent.

Not.

Possible words: for example, ""MUCIC"" not common.

""PUBIC"" P-U-B-I-C, but P absent and position 3 I? P-U-B-I-C: positions 1-P,2-U,3-B,4-I,5-C — not, we need position 3 I, here position 4 I.

Not.

We need position 3 I, so ? U I C ?

So position 1: ?, position 2: U, position 3: I, position 4: C, position 5: ?

So words like X U I C Y.

For example:
- ""CUICH"" not a word.
- ""BUICK"" B-U-I-C-K, but K absent, and position 5 K? But K is absent, so invalid.
- ""QUICK"" we already guessed, but Q absent now.
- ""MUCID"" M-U-C-I-D, but D absent and position 3 C? Not, position 3 should be I, here position 4 I.

Not.

""LUCID"" L and D absent.

Not.

Perhaps ""GUIDE"" but E absent and position 3 I? G-U-I-D-E, positions 1-G,2-U,3-I,4-D,5-E — D and E absent.

Invalid.

""JUICY"" J-U-I-C-Y, that is J-U-I-C-Y, so position 1-J,2-U,3-I,4-C,5-Y.

Yes! This matches the pattern: position 1: J, position 2: U, position 3: I, position 4: C, position 5: Y.

And J and Y are not absent, so possible.

Another word: ""CIVIC"" not.

""VIVID"" V-I-V-I-D, D absent and position 2 I? Not.

"" RABIC "" R and A absent.

Not.

"" FICUS "" F-I-C-U-S, S absent and position 2 I? Not.

So ""JUICY"" seems to be a valid option.

Are there others?

""MUFTI"" M-U-F-T-I, T absent and position 5 I? Not, position 3 F not I.

Not.

""BUXOM"" no I.

""JUMBO"" no I.

So ""JUICY"" is a candidate.

But in ""JUICY"", position 4 is C, which we have as correct, and position 5 is Y.

Y is a possible letter.

Another word: ""MUCKY"" M-U-C-K-Y, but K absent and position 3 C? Not.

Not.

""FUNKY"" F-U-N-K-Y, N and K absent.

Not.

So I think ""JUICY"" is the only common word that fits.

Perhaps ""BUY IN"" not one word.

"" CULTI "" not.

So likely ""JUICY"".

But we need to confirm if it's valid.

In the context, it should be acceptable.

Since we have U at position 2, I at 3, C at 4, and position 1 and 5 to be filled.

With J and Y.

Perhaps ""GUILT"" but L and T absent.

Not.

So I think ""JUICY"" is the word.

Therefore, we should guess ""JUICY"".

But let's see the feedback history.

In guess 4, we guessed ""QUICK"" and got U and C correct, so position 2 and 4 are fixed.

Now, for position 1 and 5, we need to find.

With ""JUICY"", it should be the word.

Perhaps there are other words, but I can't think of any.

""SUMAC"" S and A absent.

Not.

""YUCKY"" Y-U-C-K-Y, K absent and position 3 C? Not.

Not.

""ZINCY"" Z-I-N-C-Y, N absent and position 2 I? Not.

Not.

So ""JUICY"" seems to be the only possibility.

Therefore, we guess ""JUICY"".

In the response, we output it.

Thought process: With positions 2, 3, and 4 confirmed as U, I, C respectively, and a list of absent letters (A,E,R,S,P,O,N,T,H,L,D,Q,K), the only remaining letters for positions 1 and 5 are from B,F,G,J,M,V,W,X,Y,Z. The only common English word fitting the pattern _ U I C _ is ""JUICY"" (J at position 1, Y at position 5). This guess will confirm if the word is ""JUICY"" or, if incorrect, provide new information on the missing letters.

<guess>JUICY</guess>
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Current Known Information**:
   - **Position 2**: U is confirmed and correct (from QUICK feedback: U(✓)).
   - **Position 3**: I is confirmed and correct (known since Guess 1).
   - **Position 4**: C is confirmed and correct (from QUICK feedback: C(✓)).
   - **Absent Letters**: A, E, R, S, P, O, N, T, H, L, D, Q, K (from all previous feedback).
   - **Remaining Possible Letters**: B, F, G, J, M, V, W, X, Y, Z (since these haven't been tested or ruled out).

2. **Word Pattern**: The secret word must match the pattern `_ U I C _` (position 2: U, position 3: I, position 4: C). We need to find valid letters for positions 1 and 5.

3. **Evaluating Possible Words**:
   - The only common English word fitting `_ U I C _` is **""JUICY""**:
     - Position 1: J (not absent and plausible).
     - Position 5: Y (not absent and plausible; Y can act as a vowel).
   - Other combinations were considered but rejected:
     - ""MUSIC"": Invalid (S is absent, and positions don't align—S would be at position 4, but C is fixed there).
     - ""CUBIC"": Invalid (C is at position 1, but C is fixed at position 4, and O is absent).
     - ""LOGIC"": Invalid (L and O absent).
     - ""PUBIC"": Invalid (P absent and positions don't align—B at position 3, but I is fixed there).
     - ""BUICK"": Invalid (K absent).
     - No other valid words exist in common English that fit the pattern and avoid absent letters (e.g., ""MUCIC"" or ""CUICH"" are not valid words).

4. **Why ""JUICY"" is the Best Guess**:
   - It uses the confirmed positions (U at 2, I at 3, C at 4) and tests the only feasible remaining letters (J and Y).
   - If correct, it solves the puzzle. If incorrect, the feedback will provide new information on J and Y (e.g., if J or Y is absent or misplaced), but given the constraints, ""JUICY"" is the only reasonable candidate.
   - This guess leverages the high probability that the secret word is ""JUICY"" based on common vocabulary and the eliminated letter pool.

<guess>JUICY</guess>",JUICY,"We have new feedback from the fourth guess ""QUICK"":
- Q(x): Q is not in the word
- U(✓): U is in the word and in the correct position (position 2)
- I(✓): I is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, already known)
- C(✓): C is in the word and in the correct position (position 4)
- K(x): K is not in the word

So now we know:
- Position 2 is U (new information)
- Position 3 is I (known)
- Position 4 is C (new)
- Q and K are not in the word.

Also, from previous feedback, we have:
- Position 3 is I.
- C is present and now we know it's at position 4.
- U is present and at position 2.

Additionally, absent letters: from all previous:
- RAISE: R, A, S, E absent
- POINT: P, O, N, T absent
- CHILD: H, L, D absent
- QUICK: Q, K absent

So total absent: A, E, R, S, P, O, N, T, H, L, D, Q, K.

Present letters: U (pos2), I (pos3), C (pos4), and one more letter to find at position 1 and position 5.

The word pattern is: _ U I C _

We need to find the first and last letters.

Position 1 and 5 are missing.

Letters available: from the alphabet, subtract absent letters.

Absent: A, E, R, S, P, O, N, T, H, L, D, Q, K.

Remaining possible letters: B, F, G, J, M, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we need to form a valid English word.

The word must be of the form ? U I C ?

With ? being one of the remaining letters.

Possible words:

- First, position 1: can be B, F, G, J, M, V, W, X, Y, Z
- Position 5: similarly

But it must be a valid word.

Common possibilities:

- ""MUSIC"" but S is absent, and position: M-U-S-I-C, but S is absent and position 4 is I? Not, pattern is U at 2, I at 3, C at 4, so ? U I C ?

""MUSIC"" has U at 2, I at 4? Not.

"" CUBIC "" C at 1, but C is at position 4, not 1.

Not.

""LOGIC"" L and O absent.

Not.

Possible words: for example, ""MUCIC"" not common.

""PUBIC"" P-U-B-I-C, but P absent and position 3 I? P-U-B-I-C: positions 1-P,2-U,3-B,4-I,5-C — not, we need position 3 I, here position 4 I.

Not.

We need position 3 I, so ? U I C ?

So position 1: ?, position 2: U, position 3: I, position 4: C, position 5: ?

So words like X U I C Y.

For example:
- ""CUICH"" not a word.
- ""BUICK"" B-U-I-C-K, but K absent, and position 5 K? But K is absent, so invalid.
- ""QUICK"" we already guessed, but Q absent now.
- ""MUCID"" M-U-C-I-D, but D absent and position 3 C? Not, position 3 should be I, here position 4 I.

Not.

""LUCID"" L and D absent.

Not.

Perhaps ""GUIDE"" but E absent and position 3 I? G-U-I-D-E, positions 1-G,2-U,3-I,4-D,5-E — D and E absent.

Invalid.

""JUICY"" J-U-I-C-Y, that is J-U-I-C-Y, so position 1-J,2-U,3-I,4-C,5-Y.

Yes! This matches the pattern: position 1: J, position 2: U, position 3: I, position 4: C, position 5: Y.

And J and Y are not absent, so possible.

Another word: ""CIVIC"" not.

""VIVID"" V-I-V-I-D, D absent and position 2 I? Not.

"" RABIC "" R and A absent.

Not.

"" FICUS "" F-I-C-U-S, S absent and position 2 I? Not.

So ""JUICY"" seems to be a valid option.

Are there others?

""MUFTI"" M-U-F-T-I, T absent and position 5 I? Not, position 3 F not I.

Not.

""BUXOM"" no I.

""JUMBO"" no I.

So ""JUICY"" is a candidate.

But in ""JUICY"", position 4 is C, which we have as correct, and position 5 is Y.

Y is a possible letter.

Another word: ""MUCKY"" M-U-C-K-Y, but K absent and position 3 C? Not.

Not.

""FUNKY"" F-U-N-K-Y, N and K absent.

Not.

So I think ""JUICY"" is the only common word that fits.

Perhaps ""BUY IN"" not one word.

"" CULTI "" not.

So likely ""JUICY"".

But we need to confirm if it's valid.

In the context, it should be acceptable.

Since we have U at position 2, I at 3, C at 4, and position 1 and 5 to be filled.

With J and Y.

Perhaps ""GUILT"" but L and T absent.

Not.

So I think ""JUICY"" is the word.

Therefore, we should guess ""JUICY"".

But let's see the feedback history.

In guess 4, we guessed ""QUICK"" and got U and C correct, so position 2 and 4 are fixed.

Now, for position 1 and 5, we need to find.

With ""JUICY"", it should be the word.

Perhaps there are other words, but I can't think of any.

""SUMAC"" S and A absent.

Not.

""YUCKY"" Y-U-C-K-Y, K absent and position 3 C? Not.

Not.

""ZINCY"" Z-I-N-C-Y, N absent and position 2 I? Not.

Not.

So ""JUICY"" seems to be the only possibility.

Therefore, we guess ""JUICY"".

In the response, we output it.

Thought process: With positions 2, 3, and 4 confirmed as U, I, C respectively, and a list of absent letters (A,E,R,S,P,O,N,T,H,L,D,Q,K), the only remaining letters for positions 1 and 5 are from B,F,G,J,M,V,W,X,Y,Z. The only common English word fitting the pattern _ U I C _ is ""JUICY"" (J at position 1, Y at position 5). This guess will confirm if the word is ""JUICY"" or, if incorrect, provide new information on the missing letters.

<guess>JUICY</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Current Known Information**:
   - **Position 2**: U is confirmed and correct (from QUICK feedback: U(✓)).
   - **Position 3**: I is confirmed and correct (known since Guess 1).
   - **Position 4**: C is confirmed and correct (from QUICK feedback: C(✓)).
   - **Absent Letters**: A, E, R, S, P, O, N, T, H, L, D, Q, K (from all previous feedback).
   - **Remaining Possible Letters**: B, F, G, J, M, V, W, X, Y, Z (since these haven't been tested or ruled out).

2. **Word Pattern**: The secret word must match the pattern `_ U I C _` (position 2: U, position 3: I, position 4: C). We need to find valid letters for positions 1 and 5.

3. **Evaluating Possible Words**:
   - The only common English word fitting `_ U I C _` is **""JUICY""**:
     - Position 1: J (not absent and plausible).
     - Position 5: Y (not absent and plausible; Y can act as a vowel).
   - Other combinations were considered but rejected:
     - ""MUSIC"": Invalid (S is absent, and positions don't align—S would be at position 4, but C is fixed there).
     - ""CUBIC"": Invalid (C is at position 1, but C is fixed at position 4, and O is absent).
     - ""LOGIC"": Invalid (L and O absent).
     - ""PUBIC"": Invalid (P absent and positions don't align—B at position 3, but I is fixed there).
     - ""BUICK"": Invalid (K absent).
     - No other valid words exist in common English that fit the pattern and avoid absent letters (e.g., ""MUCIC"" or ""CUICH"" are not valid words).

4. **Why ""JUICY"" is the Best Guess**:
   - It uses the confirmed positions (U at 2, I at 3, C at 4) and tests the only feasible remaining letters (J and Y).
   - If correct, it solves the puzzle. If incorrect, the feedback will provide new information on J and Y (e.g., if J or Y is absent or misplaced), but given the constraints, ""JUICY"" is the only reasonable candidate.
   - This guess leverages the high probability that the secret word is ""JUICY"" based on common vocabulary and the eliminated letter pool.",Guess 5: JUICY -> FEEDBACK: J(✓) U(✓) I(✓) C(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
