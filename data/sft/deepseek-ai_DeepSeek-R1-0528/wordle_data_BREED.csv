We are starting the game. We have no prior information about the secret word. 
 A good first guess should cover common letters and have a balanced set of vowels and consonants.
 One common strategy is to start with words that have common letters and no repeated letters to maximize information.

 Popular starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc. 
 I will choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 Let's go with ""CRANE"" as the first guess.

We are making the first guess, so we have no prior information. 
A strategic first guess should:
- Include common vowels (like A, E) and common consonants (like R, S, T).
- Avoid repeating letters to maximize information gain.
- Cover frequent letters in 5-letter words.

The word ""CRANE"" is ideal because:
- It contains three vowels (A and E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).
- All letters are distinct, giving us feedback on five unique letters.
- It's among the top-rated opening words in similar word games (like Wordle).

After this guess, the feedback (✓, -, or x) on each letter will help narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

We are given feedback on the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter of the secret word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

What we know so far:
- The secret word has 5 letters.
- The second letter is R (position 2).
- The letter E is in the word, but not at the end (position 5).
- Letters C, A, and N are not in the word.

Since E is present but not at the end, it must be in one of the positions: 1, 3, or 4 (since position 5 is taken by the guess, but it's wrong position).

We also eliminated C, A, N.

For the next guess, we should include E and avoid C, A, N. Also, we should consider that the second letter is R.

We want a word that:
- Has R in the second position.
- Includes E (but not at the last position since that gave us '-', meaning it's elsewhere).
- Avoids using C, A, N.

Moreover, we want to test other common letters to get more information.

Consider the word structure: _ R _ _ _

Since E is somewhere else, it can be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Possible words: Let's try to cover more common letters. Some common consonants are S, T, L, etc.

I propose a guess that has:
- First position: a letter we want to test (common vowel or consonant) that isn't C, A, N.
- Second position: R (locked)
- Third position: a new letter, possibly a vowel if we haven't tried enough?
- Fourth position: maybe we can test E here? Or another letter.
- Fifth position: test another common letter.

But note: E is already in the word and we know it's not at the end. So if we put E in position 4, that would be a good test? Or maybe put it in position 1 or 3 to check.

Alternatively, we might avoid putting E in the same position again? Actually, we can put it in different positions to see.

Aim for words that have E and common consonants.

Example words: 
- ""PERCH"" - but C is eliminated? C is not allowed. We must avoid C, A, N.
- ""BERTH"" - has B, E, R, T, H. But second letter is E, which would conflict? Wait, we need R in the second position.

We need the word to have R in the second position. So the second letter must be R.

Possible words: 
- BREVE: has E but the second letter is R? BREVE: B, R, E, V, E. But it has repeated E? Also, E at the end? We know E is not at the end? But in the word, we have E at positions 3 and 5. Position 5 is the same as last time? The feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5? Actually, our guess had E at position 5 and it was marked as '-' meaning E is in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at position 5 again, it would again be wrong position? We know that, but it also tells us nothing new? We want to test E at other positions.

But we shouldn't repeat the same mistake? Actually, if we put E at position 5 again, we know it will be wrong position, so we avoid that? We can test E in other positions instead.

So for the next guess, let's place E in a different position, such as position 4 or 1.

Also, we must avoid C, A, N.

I'll brainstorm words that fit:
- One word: ""PRIME"" - P, R, I, M, E. But structure: position1: P, position2: R, position3: I, position4: M, position5: E? But wait, the feedback from first guess said E is not at position 5? So if we put E at position5, we know it will be '-' again? And we don't learn the actual position? So better not to have E at position5.

Instead, we can put E at position 1: like ""ERASE"" - E, R, A, S, E. But A is eliminated? So we cannot use A.

Alternatively, ""E"" at position 3: e.g., ""TREES"" - has repeated E? and second letter R, but the word has two E's? Not good because we want unique letters? Actually, repeated letters are allowed in words, but for testing, it might complicate the feedback? So if possible, avoid repeated letters.

Another word: ""PRICE"" - but C is eliminated? No, we cannot use C.

So eliminate C, A, N.

Consider words starting with:
- Position 1: allow letters that are common and not eliminated. Possible: B, D, E, ... etc.
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: a new vowel? We haven't tried I, O, U? Or consonants?
- Position 4: E? Let's try E at position 4 to see if that's the spot? Or skip E and just include it elsewhere?

Actually, we must include E because we know it's in the word. So we have to include E.

Idea: put E at position 1. Then we test if E is the first letter? Then the word would be E R ? ? ?

But position5: we must avoid something that was eliminated? And not the same as others.

Possible guesses: 
- ""ERRED"": has R at position2 and E at position1? But ERRED: E, R, R, E, D - repeated R? And no new letters? Not ideal.

Another: ""BERTH"": B, E, R, T, H - but then E is at position1? And R at position2? That's the structure we need? The word: B (1), E (2)? Wait no, the positions: 
- Position1: B
- Position2: R
- Position3: E  --- here we put E at position3. That's new? Then position4: T, position5: H.

So the word is B, R, E, T, H -> ""BRETH""? Is that a word? Actually, it's ""BERTH"", but spelled B-E-R-T-H? No, ""BERTH"" is B,E,R,T,H? Then positions: 
- Letter1: B
- Letter2: E? Oh, wait, if we have ""BERTH"", it is:
- Position1: B
- Position2: E (not R) -> but we need R at position2. So we cannot use ""BERTH"" because the second letter is E, not R.

We need the word to have R in the second position. So we must have R at index 1 (if we count from 0, but in position 2: second slot).

So words like: X, R, Y, Z, W

Let me think of common words that start with R at second position. For example:
- PRICE (but C eliminated)
- TREND: T, R, E, N, D -> but N is eliminated? N is not allowed.

Another: ""CRUST"" -> but C eliminated.

""ARISE"" but A eliminated? A is not allowed.

So we avoid A, C, N.

Look for words: _ R _ _ _

With E somewhere? And no A, C, N.

Possible words:
- DRESS: D, R, E, S, S -> repeated S? And S at position4 and 5? But we might test S.
- Alternatively: ""DRESS"" is okay? But repeated letters? Not ideal for testing.

""BREVE"": B, R, E, V, E -> repeated E? And E at end? But we know E not at end? So we want to avoid E at end? But if we put E at position3 and position5? Then we have two E's? But the secret word has E? We don't know how many E's? It might have multiple E's? Or only one? We don't know.

Actually, we don't know the multiplicity. To simplify, let's avoid repeated letters if possible.

Try ""PRUDE"": P, R, U, D, E -> U and D are new? And E at end? Again, E at position5 we already know is wrong? But we don't know if putting E at position4? Wait, in PRUDE: positions: 
1: P
2: R
3: U
4: D
5: E

But putting E at position5 we know is wrong? So if we get feedback E: '-' again, that doesn't give new info? So better to put E at positions 1, 3, or 4.

So let's choose a word with E at position1: E R ? ? ?

But first letter E: and second R? Then the word would be E R ... ? 

Word: ""ERASE"" -> E, R, A, S, E -> but A eliminated? And E repeated? Not good.

""ERROR"": E, R, R, O, R -> repeated R? Not good.

""ERUPT"": E, R, U, P, T -> U and P and T are new? And no repeated letters? Also, avoids C,A,N.

Is ""ERUPT"" a valid word? Yes, meaning: to erupt volcano? So I think so.

Alternatively, ""ERECT"": E, R, E, C, T -> repeated E and C eliminated.

Therefore, ""ERUPT"" seems good: 
- Position1: E -> we test if it's the first letter? Feedback: if it is ✓, then E is at position1? Or if ' - ' then E is elsewhere? Either way we get info.
- Position2: R -> we already know R is at position2? So it should be ✓? But wait, let's see: the feedback might tell us it's correct? Actually, we know R is in the word and at position2? So when we put R at position2, it will be ✓ because it's correct? But that's redundant? We are using one of our guesses? Although it confirms? Actually, we won't get new info for R? But that's okay? Because we are forced to put R at position2? 

Alternatively, we can skip putting E at position1 and put it elsewhere? Let me see if we can test E at position3 or 4 without violating.

Another word: ""TRIBE"": T, R, I, B, E -> then E at position5? We know that E is not at position5? So we get '-' again? But that's not helpful? And we could have tested E at another position? So better to avoid E at position5.

Put E at position4: e.g., ""PRONE"": P, R, O, N, E -> but N eliminated? Skip.

""TRICE"": T, R, I, C, E -> C eliminated.

""BRUTE"": B, R, U, T, E -> E at position5? Again, same problem? But if we do this, we might get E at position5 marked as '-' which we already know? So why not? Actually, we test U and T? But we don't test E in a new position? 

But we can get feedback for U and T? So that's valuable? The E at position5 will just get '-', which we know? So it doesn't harm? But we might miss testing E in other positions? We have limited guesses.

Another idea: put E at position3. For example, ""WRECK"": but W and K? And C? C eliminated. Skip.

""CREPT"": C eliminated? Skip.

""GREVE"": not a common word? 

""CRUDE"": C eliminated? Skip.

""FRIES"": F, R, I, E, S -> here we put E at position4? So the word: F, R, I, E, S? Structure: 
- Position1: F
- Position2: R (correct)
- Position3: I
- Position4: E (so we test E at position4? This is new? And position5: S.

Also, F, I, S are new letters? So we test three new letters? And E at a new position? 

Another candidate: ""PRIME"": P, R, I, M, E -> but E at position5? We avoid E at position5? 

But ""PRIME"" would have E at position5? We could use ""PRIDE"": but D? And E at end? 

Wait, let's stick to ""FRIES"": 
- F (new)
- R (known)
- I (new)
- E (in word but position? putting at position4, which is new?)
- S (new)

So we get feedback on F, I, E, S? And E at position4? 

Alternatively, ""TRIED"": T, R, I, E, D -> E at position4? Yes? And D new.

""TRIED"" seems valid? 

But E is at position4? So we can see if E is at position4? 

Given the options, I think ""TRIED"" or ""GRIME"" might work? But ""GRIME"": G, R, I, M, E -> E at end? 

I prefer ""TRIED"": T, R, I, E, D -> 
- T
- R (correct)
- I
- E (at position4)
- D

But we don't test S? But we can test S later? 

Given our goal, I think ""ERUPT"" is fine? But let me check:

""ERUPT"": 
- Position1: E
- Position2: R (will be ✓)
- Position3: U
- Position4: P
- Position5: T

If E is at position1, then feedback gives ✓ for E? Else if E is not at position1, then '-' because E is in the word? Or if not at position1, but in another position? 

This way we test E in position1? Which is one candidate position? 

Alternatively, if the secret word has E at position3? Then we don't test position3? 

But with ""ERUPT"", we test E at position1? And positions 3,4,5 with U,P,T? 

For strategic reasons, using a word that tests E at another position? We know E is not at position5? And we tested CRANE? So E at position1? That's one candidate? 

But E could be at position3? Or position4? 

Given that we want to test E at a position we haven't tried? Position1? We haven't tried? 

Also, ""ERUPT"" only has 5 distinct letters? So that's good? 

Moreover, it avoids eliminated letters? 

Hence, I choose ""ERUPT""? 

Alternative: ""FRAME"": but A eliminated? 

""CRANE"" eliminated? 

""FRECK"": C eliminated? 

We must avoid A, C, N. 

So ""ERUPT"" is acceptable? 

But let me think of other words: 

- ""TRIPE"": T, R, I, P, E -> but E at end? 

""TRIPE"": E at position5? We know it will be '-' again? So not informative?

Better to put E in a new position?

Put E in position4: ""WORSE""? W, O, R, S, E -> but second letter O? We need R at second position? 

Only words with R as second letter: 

So ""TERSE"": T, E, R, S, E -> repeated E? and R at third position? Not second.

Words with R as second letter: 
- PRIZE: P, R, I, Z, E -> E at end? 
- BRINE: B, R, I, N, E -> N eliminated? Skip.

So after considering, I think ""ERUPT"" is a good choice? Or perhaps ""TRIBE"": but E at end? 

Another word: ""PRESET"": too long? We need 5-letter word.

Finally, let me pick ""BRIDE"": B, R, I, D, E -> E at end? Same issue? 

""GRIME"": G, R, I, M, E -> E at end? 

Which brings me back? 

Perhaps accept E at the end? We know E will be '-'? But what if the word has E elsewhere? We get info? Actually, if we get E at position5 as - again? That doesn't tell us anything new? But we test the new letters.

Therefore, let me pick a word that tests new letters and doesn't care about E at end? Because we know E is in the word? And we can deduce from the feedback? 

So ""PRIME"" is: P, R, I, M, E? 

But M and P and I? 

Or ""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E -> E at end.

Similarly, ""TRUCE"": C eliminated? 

Then I'll choose ""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E. 

But let me do ""PRICE"" doesn't work? 

Avoid C? 

Better: ""BRUME"": not common? 

Perhaps ""WRITE"": W, R, I, T, E -> yes? With E at end? 

But W, I, T are new? 

So ""WRITE"": 
- Position1: W
- Position2: R (will be ✓)
- Position3: I
- Position4: T
- Position5: E (we know '-' will appear for E? But that's okay? then the feedback for I and T? And W? 

Alternatively, we have a word that tests E in a different position? 

But from the available choices, ""ERUPT"" tests E in position1? Which is good? 

Let me decide: 

Strategy 1: If we put E in position1? Then feedback: 
 - If E in position1: ✓
 - If not: '-'? But since E is in the word? It will be '-', meaning E is elsewhere? 

That's better? Because we know one more position? 

With ""ERUPT"": 
- If E is at position1? We get ✓
- If not? Then E is not at position1? So it must be at position 3 or 4? Because we already know it's not at position5? 

That reduces possibilities? 

Also, we test U, P, T? Which are common letters? 

So I think ""ERUPT"" is a good guess? 

Therefore, I'll go with ""ERUPT"". 

If we get ✗ for E? But that cannot happen? Because we already know E is in the word? So E will either be ✓ or '-'. 

Yes? 

So guess: ""ERUPT""
</think>
Based on the previous feedback for ""CRANE"": 
- R is in the correct position (position 2). 
- E is in the word but not in position 5. 
- C, A, and N are not in the word.

For the next guess:
- I need a word with R in position 2 and E included (but not in position 5). 
- It should avoid C, A, and N to narrow down possibilities. 
- Testing E in position 1 could provide new information: if E is correct there, great; if marked as misplaced, it must be in positions 3 or 4. 
- Words like ""ERUPT"" fit well: it has E in position 1, R in position 2, and tests new letters (U, P, T). This maximizes information gain without repeating eliminated letters.

The guessed word is **""ERUPT""**.

<guess>ERUPT</guess>",ERUPT,"We are given feedback on the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter of the secret word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

What we know so far:
- The secret word has 5 letters.
- The second letter is R (position 2).
- The letter E is in the word, but not at the end (position 5).
- Letters C, A, and N are not in the word.

Since E is present but not at the end, it must be in one of the positions: 1, 3, or 4 (since position 5 is taken by the guess, but it's wrong position).

We also eliminated C, A, N.

For the next guess, we should include E and avoid C, A, N. Also, we should consider that the second letter is R.

We want a word that:
- Has R in the second position.
- Includes E (but not at the last position since that gave us '-', meaning it's elsewhere).
- Avoids using C, A, N.

Moreover, we want to test other common letters to get more information.

Consider the word structure: _ R _ _ _

Since E is somewhere else, it can be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Possible words: Let's try to cover more common letters. Some common consonants are S, T, L, etc.

I propose a guess that has:
- First position: a letter we want to test (common vowel or consonant) that isn't C, A, N.
- Second position: R (locked)
- Third position: a new letter, possibly a vowel if we haven't tried enough?
- Fourth position: maybe we can test E here? Or another letter.
- Fifth position: test another common letter.

But note: E is already in the word and we know it's not at the end. So if we put E in position 4, that would be a good test? Or maybe put it in position 1 or 3 to check.

Alternatively, we might avoid putting E in the same position again? Actually, we can put it in different positions to see.

Aim for words that have E and common consonants.

Example words: 
- ""PERCH"" - but C is eliminated? C is not allowed. We must avoid C, A, N.
- ""BERTH"" - has B, E, R, T, H. But second letter is E, which would conflict? Wait, we need R in the second position.

We need the word to have R in the second position. So the second letter must be R.

Possible words: 
- BREVE: has E but the second letter is R? BREVE: B, R, E, V, E. But it has repeated E? Also, E at the end? We know E is not at the end? But in the word, we have E at positions 3 and 5. Position 5 is the same as last time? The feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5? Actually, our guess had E at position 5 and it was marked as '-' meaning E is in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at position 5 again, it would again be wrong position? We know that, but it also tells us nothing new? We want to test E at other positions.

But we shouldn't repeat the same mistake? Actually, if we put E at position 5 again, we know it will be wrong position, so we avoid that? We can test E in other positions instead.

So for the next guess, let's place E in a different position, such as position 4 or 1.

Also, we must avoid C, A, N.

I'll brainstorm words that fit:
- One word: ""PRIME"" - P, R, I, M, E. But structure: position1: P, position2: R, position3: I, position4: M, position5: E? But wait, the feedback from first guess said E is not at position 5? So if we put E at position5, we know it will be '-' again? And we don't learn the actual position? So better not to have E at position5.

Instead, we can put E at position 1: like ""ERASE"" - E, R, A, S, E. But A is eliminated? So we cannot use A.

Alternatively, ""E"" at position 3: e.g., ""TREES"" - has repeated E? and second letter R, but the word has two E's? Not good because we want unique letters? Actually, repeated letters are allowed in words, but for testing, it might complicate the feedback? So if possible, avoid repeated letters.

Another word: ""PRICE"" - but C is eliminated? No, we cannot use C.

So eliminate C, A, N.

Consider words starting with:
- Position 1: allow letters that are common and not eliminated. Possible: B, D, E, ... etc.
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: a new vowel? We haven't tried I, O, U? Or consonants?
- Position 4: E? Let's try E at position 4 to see if that's the spot? Or skip E and just include it elsewhere?

Actually, we must include E because we know it's in the word. So we have to include E.

Idea: put E at position 1. Then we test if E is the first letter? Then the word would be E R ? ? ?

But position5: we must avoid something that was eliminated? And not the same as others.

Possible guesses: 
- ""ERRED"": has R at position2 and E at position1? But ERRED: E, R, R, E, D - repeated R? And no new letters? Not ideal.

Another: ""BERTH"": B, E, R, T, H - but then E is at position1? And R at position2? That's the structure we need? The word: B (1), E (2)? Wait no, the positions: 
- Position1: B
- Position2: R
- Position3: E  --- here we put E at position3. That's new? Then position4: T, position5: H.

So the word is B, R, E, T, H -> ""BRETH""? Is that a word? Actually, it's ""BERTH"", but spelled B-E-R-T-H? No, ""BERTH"" is B,E,R,T,H? Then positions: 
- Letter1: B
- Letter2: E? Oh, wait, if we have ""BERTH"", it is:
- Position1: B
- Position2: E (not R) -> but we need R at position2. So we cannot use ""BERTH"" because the second letter is E, not R.

We need the word to have R in the second position. So we must have R at index 1 (if we count from 0, but in position 2: second slot).

So words like: X, R, Y, Z, W

Let me think of common words that start with R at second position. For example:
- PRICE (but C eliminated)
- TREND: T, R, E, N, D -> but N is eliminated? N is not allowed.

Another: ""CRUST"" -> but C eliminated.

""ARISE"" but A eliminated? A is not allowed.

So we avoid A, C, N.

Look for words: _ R _ _ _

With E somewhere? And no A, C, N.

Possible words:
- DRESS: D, R, E, S, S -> repeated S? And S at position4 and 5? But we might test S.
- Alternatively: ""DRESS"" is okay? But repeated letters? Not ideal for testing.

""BREVE"": B, R, E, V, E -> repeated E? And E at end? But we know E not at end? So we want to avoid E at end? But if we put E at position3 and position5? Then we have two E's? But the secret word has E? We don't know how many E's? It might have multiple E's? Or only one? We don't know.

Actually, we don't know the multiplicity. To simplify, let's avoid repeated letters if possible.

Try ""PRUDE"": P, R, U, D, E -> U and D are new? And E at end? Again, E at position5 we already know is wrong? But we don't know if putting E at position4? Wait, in PRUDE: positions: 
1: P
2: R
3: U
4: D
5: E

But putting E at position5 we know is wrong? So if we get feedback E: '-' again, that doesn't give new info? So better to put E at positions 1, 3, or 4.

So let's choose a word with E at position1: E R ? ? ?

But first letter E: and second R? Then the word would be E R ... ? 

Word: ""ERASE"" -> E, R, A, S, E -> but A eliminated? And E repeated? Not good.

""ERROR"": E, R, R, O, R -> repeated R? Not good.

""ERUPT"": E, R, U, P, T -> U and P and T are new? And no repeated letters? Also, avoids C,A,N.

Is ""ERUPT"" a valid word? Yes, meaning: to erupt volcano? So I think so.

Alternatively, ""ERECT"": E, R, E, C, T -> repeated E and C eliminated.

Therefore, ""ERUPT"" seems good: 
- Position1: E -> we test if it's the first letter? Feedback: if it is ✓, then E is at position1? Or if ' - ' then E is elsewhere? Either way we get info.
- Position2: R -> we already know R is at position2? So it should be ✓? But wait, let's see: the feedback might tell us it's correct? Actually, we know R is in the word and at position2? So when we put R at position2, it will be ✓ because it's correct? But that's redundant? We are using one of our guesses? Although it confirms? Actually, we won't get new info for R? But that's okay? Because we are forced to put R at position2? 

Alternatively, we can skip putting E at position1 and put it elsewhere? Let me see if we can test E at position3 or 4 without violating.

Another word: ""TRIBE"": T, R, I, B, E -> then E at position5? We know that E is not at position5? So we get '-' again? But that's not helpful? And we could have tested E at another position? So better to avoid E at position5.

Put E at position4: e.g., ""PRONE"": P, R, O, N, E -> but N eliminated? Skip.

""TRICE"": T, R, I, C, E -> C eliminated.

""BRUTE"": B, R, U, T, E -> E at position5? Again, same problem? But if we do this, we might get E at position5 marked as '-' which we already know? So why not? Actually, we test U and T? But we don't test E in a new position? 

But we can get feedback for U and T? So that's valuable? The E at position5 will just get '-', which we know? So it doesn't harm? But we might miss testing E in other positions? We have limited guesses.

Another idea: put E at position3. For example, ""WRECK"": but W and K? And C? C eliminated. Skip.

""CREPT"": C eliminated? Skip.

""GREVE"": not a common word? 

""CRUDE"": C eliminated? Skip.

""FRIES"": F, R, I, E, S -> here we put E at position4? So the word: F, R, I, E, S? Structure: 
- Position1: F
- Position2: R (correct)
- Position3: I
- Position4: E (so we test E at position4? This is new? And position5: S.

Also, F, I, S are new letters? So we test three new letters? And E at a new position? 

Another candidate: ""PRIME"": P, R, I, M, E -> but E at position5? We avoid E at position5? 

But ""PRIME"" would have E at position5? We could use ""PRIDE"": but D? And E at end? 

Wait, let's stick to ""FRIES"": 
- F (new)
- R (known)
- I (new)
- E (in word but position? putting at position4, which is new?)
- S (new)

So we get feedback on F, I, E, S? And E at position4? 

Alternatively, ""TRIED"": T, R, I, E, D -> E at position4? Yes? And D new.

""TRIED"" seems valid? 

But E is at position4? So we can see if E is at position4? 

Given the options, I think ""TRIED"" or ""GRIME"" might work? But ""GRIME"": G, R, I, M, E -> E at end? 

I prefer ""TRIED"": T, R, I, E, D -> 
- T
- R (correct)
- I
- E (at position4)
- D

But we don't test S? But we can test S later? 

Given our goal, I think ""ERUPT"" is fine? But let me check:

""ERUPT"": 
- Position1: E
- Position2: R (will be ✓)
- Position3: U
- Position4: P
- Position5: T

If E is at position1, then feedback gives ✓ for E? Else if E is not at position1, then '-' because E is in the word? Or if not at position1, but in another position? 

This way we test E in position1? Which is one candidate position? 

Alternatively, if the secret word has E at position3? Then we don't test position3? 

But with ""ERUPT"", we test E at position1? And positions 3,4,5 with U,P,T? 

For strategic reasons, using a word that tests E at another position? We know E is not at position5? And we tested CRANE? So E at position1? That's one candidate? 

But E could be at position3? Or position4? 

Given that we want to test E at a position we haven't tried? Position1? We haven't tried? 

Also, ""ERUPT"" only has 5 distinct letters? So that's good? 

Moreover, it avoids eliminated letters? 

Hence, I choose ""ERUPT""? 

Alternative: ""FRAME"": but A eliminated? 

""CRANE"" eliminated? 

""FRECK"": C eliminated? 

We must avoid A, C, N. 

So ""ERUPT"" is acceptable? 

But let me think of other words: 

- ""TRIPE"": T, R, I, P, E -> but E at end? 

""TRIPE"": E at position5? We know it will be '-' again? So not informative?

Better to put E in a new position?

Put E in position4: ""WORSE""? W, O, R, S, E -> but second letter O? We need R at second position? 

Only words with R as second letter: 

So ""TERSE"": T, E, R, S, E -> repeated E? and R at third position? Not second.

Words with R as second letter: 
- PRIZE: P, R, I, Z, E -> E at end? 
- BRINE: B, R, I, N, E -> N eliminated? Skip.

So after considering, I think ""ERUPT"" is a good choice? Or perhaps ""TRIBE"": but E at end? 

Another word: ""PRESET"": too long? We need 5-letter word.

Finally, let me pick ""BRIDE"": B, R, I, D, E -> E at end? Same issue? 

""GRIME"": G, R, I, M, E -> E at end? 

Which brings me back? 

Perhaps accept E at the end? We know E will be '-'? But what if the word has E elsewhere? We get info? Actually, if we get E at position5 as - again? That doesn't tell us anything new? But we test the new letters.

Therefore, let me pick a word that tests new letters and doesn't care about E at end? Because we know E is in the word? And we can deduce from the feedback? 

So ""PRIME"" is: P, R, I, M, E? 

But M and P and I? 

Or ""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E -> E at end.

Similarly, ""TRUCE"": C eliminated? 

Then I'll choose ""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E. 

But let me do ""PRICE"" doesn't work? 

Avoid C? 

Better: ""BRUME"": not common? 

Perhaps ""WRITE"": W, R, I, T, E -> yes? With E at end? 

But W, I, T are new? 

So ""WRITE"": 
- Position1: W
- Position2: R (will be ✓)
- Position3: I
- Position4: T
- Position5: E (we know '-' will appear for E? But that's okay? then the feedback for I and T? And W? 

Alternatively, we have a word that tests E in a different position? 

But from the available choices, ""ERUPT"" tests E in position1? Which is good? 

Let me decide: 

Strategy 1: If we put E in position1? Then feedback: 
 - If E in position1: ✓
 - If not: '-'? But since E is in the word? It will be '-', meaning E is elsewhere? 

That's better? Because we know one more position? 

With ""ERUPT"": 
- If E is at position1? We get ✓
- If not? Then E is not at position1? So it must be at position 3 or 4? Because we already know it's not at position5? 

That reduces possibilities? 

Also, we test U, P, T? Which are common letters? 

So I think ""ERUPT"" is a good guess? 

Therefore, I'll go with ""ERUPT"". 

If we get ✗ for E? But that cannot happen? Because we already know E is in the word? So E will either be ✓ or '-'. 

Yes? 

So guess: ""ERUPT""Based on the previous feedback for ""CRANE"": 
- R is in the correct position (position 2). 
- E is in the word but not in position 5. 
- C, A, and N are not in the word.

For the next guess:
- I need a word with R in position 2 and E included (but not in position 5). 
- It should avoid C, A, and N to narrow down possibilities. 
- Testing E in position 1 could provide new information: if E is correct there, great; if marked as misplaced, it must be in positions 3 or 4. 
- Words like ""ERUPT"" fit well: it has E in position 1, R in position 2, and tests new letters (U, P, T). This maximizes information gain without repeating eliminated letters.

The guessed word is **""ERUPT""**.",Guess 2: ERUPT -> FEEDBACK: E(-) R(✓) U(x) P(x) T(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,BREED,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior information about the secret word. 
 A good first guess should cover common letters and have a balanced set of vowels and consonants.
 One common strategy is to start with words that have common letters and no repeated letters to maximize information.

 Popular starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc. 
 I will choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 Let's go with ""CRANE"" as the first guess.<thinking>
We are making the first guess, so we have no prior information. 
A strategic first guess should:
- Include common vowels (like A, E) and common consonants (like R, S, T).
- Avoid repeating letters to maximize information gain.
- Cover frequent letters in 5-letter words.

The word ""CRANE"" is ideal because:
- It contains three vowels (A and E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).
- All letters are distinct, giving us feedback on five unique letters.
- It's among the top-rated opening words in similar word games (like Wordle).

After this guess, the feedback (✓, -, or x) on each letter will help narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.
</thinking>

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter of the secret word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

What we know so far:
- The secret word has 5 letters.
- The second letter is R (position 2).
- The letter E is in the word, but not at the end (position 5).
- Letters C, A, and N are not in the word.

Since E is present but not at the end, it must be in one of the positions: 1, 3, or 4 (since position 5 is taken by the guess, but it's wrong position).

We also eliminated C, A, N.

For the next guess, we should include E and avoid C, A, N. Also, we should consider that the second letter is R.

We want a word that:
- Has R in the second position.
- Includes E (but not at the last position since that gave us '-', meaning it's elsewhere).
- Avoids using C, A, N.

Moreover, we want to test other common letters to get more information.

Consider the word structure: _ R _ _ _

Since E is somewhere else, it can be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Possible words: Let's try to cover more common letters. Some common consonants are S, T, L, etc.

I propose a guess that has:
- First position: a letter we want to test (common vowel or consonant) that isn't C, A, N.
- Second position: R (locked)
- Third position: a new letter, possibly a vowel if we haven't tried enough?
- Fourth position: maybe we can test E here? Or another letter.
- Fifth position: test another common letter.

But note: E is already in the word and we know it's not at the end. So if we put E in position 4, that would be a good test? Or maybe put it in position 1 or 3 to check.

Alternatively, we might avoid putting E in the same position again? Actually, we can put it in different positions to see.

Aim for words that have E and common consonants.

Example words: 
- ""PERCH"" - but C is eliminated? C is not allowed. We must avoid C, A, N.
- ""BERTH"" - has B, E, R, T, H. But second letter is E, which would conflict? Wait, we need R in the second position.

We need the word to have R in the second position. So the second letter must be R.

Possible words: 
- BREVE: has E but the second letter is R? BREVE: B, R, E, V, E. But it has repeated E? Also, E at the end? We know E is not at the end? But in the word, we have E at positions 3 and 5. Position 5 is the same as last time? The feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5? Actually, our guess had E at position 5 and it was marked as '-' meaning E is in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at position 5 again, it would again be wrong position? We know that, but it also tells us nothing new? We want to test E at other positions.

But we shouldn't repeat the same mistake? Actually, if we put E at position 5 again, we know it will be wrong position, so we avoid that? We can test E in other positions instead.

So for the next guess, let's place E in a different position, such as position 4 or 1.

Also, we must avoid C, A, N.

I'll brainstorm words that fit:
- One word: ""PRIME"" - P, R, I, M, E. But structure: position1: P, position2: R, position3: I, position4: M, position5: E? But wait, the feedback from first guess said E is not at position 5? So if we put E at position5, we know it will be '-' again? And we don't learn the actual position? So better not to have E at position5.

Instead, we can put E at position 1: like ""ERASE"" - E, R, A, S, E. But A is eliminated? So we cannot use A.

Alternatively, ""E"" at position 3: e.g., ""TREES"" - has repeated E? and second letter R, but the word has two E's? Not good because we want unique letters? Actually, repeated letters are allowed in words, but for testing, it might complicate the feedback? So if possible, avoid repeated letters.

Another word: ""PRICE"" - but C is eliminated? No, we cannot use C.

So eliminate C, A, N.

Consider words starting with:
- Position 1: allow letters that are common and not eliminated. Possible: B, D, E, ... etc.
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: a new vowel? We haven't tried I, O, U? Or consonants?
- Position 4: E? Let's try E at position 4 to see if that's the spot? Or skip E and just include it elsewhere?

Actually, we must include E because we know it's in the word. So we have to include E.

Idea: put E at position 1. Then we test if E is the first letter? Then the word would be E R ? ? ?

But position5: we must avoid something that was eliminated? And not the same as others.

Possible guesses: 
- ""ERRED"": has R at position2 and E at position1? But ERRED: E, R, R, E, D - repeated R? And no new letters? Not ideal.

Another: ""BERTH"": B, E, R, T, H - but then E is at position1? And R at position2? That's the structure we need? The word: B (1), E (2)? Wait no, the positions: 
- Position1: B
- Position2: R
- Position3: E  --- here we put E at position3. That's new? Then position4: T, position5: H.

So the word is B, R, E, T, H -> ""BRETH""? Is that a word? Actually, it's ""BERTH"", but spelled B-E-R-T-H? No, ""BERTH"" is B,E,R,T,H? Then positions: 
- Letter1: B
- Letter2: E? Oh, wait, if we have ""BERTH"", it is:
- Position1: B
- Position2: E (not R) -> but we need R at position2. So we cannot use ""BERTH"" because the second letter is E, not R.

We need the word to have R in the second position. So we must have R at index 1 (if we count from 0, but in position 2: second slot).

So words like: X, R, Y, Z, W

Let me think of common words that start with R at second position. For example:
- PRICE (but C eliminated)
- TREND: T, R, E, N, D -> but N is eliminated? N is not allowed.

Another: ""CRUST"" -> but C eliminated.

""ARISE"" but A eliminated? A is not allowed.

So we avoid A, C, N.

Look for words: _ R _ _ _

With E somewhere? And no A, C, N.

Possible words:
- DRESS: D, R, E, S, S -> repeated S? And S at position4 and 5? But we might test S.
- Alternatively: ""DRESS"" is okay? But repeated letters? Not ideal for testing.

""BREVE"": B, R, E, V, E -> repeated E? And E at end? But we know E not at end? So we want to avoid E at end? But if we put E at position3 and position5? Then we have two E's? But the secret word has E? We don't know how many E's? It might have multiple E's? Or only one? We don't know.

Actually, we don't know the multiplicity. To simplify, let's avoid repeated letters if possible.

Try ""PRUDE"": P, R, U, D, E -> U and D are new? And E at end? Again, E at position5 we already know is wrong? But we don't know if putting E at position4? Wait, in PRUDE: positions: 
1: P
2: R
3: U
4: D
5: E

But putting E at position5 we know is wrong? So if we get feedback E: '-' again, that doesn't give new info? So better to put E at positions 1, 3, or 4.

So let's choose a word with E at position1: E R ? ? ?

But first letter E: and second R? Then the word would be E R ... ? 

Word: ""ERASE"" -> E, R, A, S, E -> but A eliminated? And E repeated? Not good.

""ERROR"": E, R, R, O, R -> repeated R? Not good.

""ERUPT"": E, R, U, P, T -> U and P and T are new? And no repeated letters? Also, avoids C,A,N.

Is ""ERUPT"" a valid word? Yes, meaning: to erupt volcano? So I think so.

Alternatively, ""ERECT"": E, R, E, C, T -> repeated E and C eliminated.

Therefore, ""ERUPT"" seems good: 
- Position1: E -> we test if it's the first letter? Feedback: if it is ✓, then E is at position1? Or if ' - ' then E is elsewhere? Either way we get info.
- Position2: R -> we already know R is at position2? So it should be ✓? But wait, let's see: the feedback might tell us it's correct? Actually, we know R is in the word and at position2? So when we put R at position2, it will be ✓ because it's correct? But that's redundant? We are using one of our guesses? Although it confirms? Actually, we won't get new info for R? But that's okay? Because we are forced to put R at position2? 

Alternatively, we can skip putting E at position1 and put it elsewhere? Let me see if we can test E at position3 or 4 without violating.

Another word: ""TRIBE"": T, R, I, B, E -> then E at position5? We know that E is not at position5? So we get '-' again? But that's not helpful? And we could have tested E at another position? So better to avoid E at position5.

Put E at position4: e.g., ""PRONE"": P, R, O, N, E -> but N eliminated? Skip.

""TRICE"": T, R, I, C, E -> C eliminated.

""BRUTE"": B, R, U, T, E -> E at position5? Again, same problem? But if we do this, we might get E at position5 marked as '-' which we already know? So why not? Actually, we test U and T? But we don't test E in a new position? 

But we can get feedback for U and T? So that's valuable? The E at position5 will just get '-', which we know? So it doesn't harm? But we might miss testing E in other positions? We have limited guesses.

Another idea: put E at position3. For example, ""WRECK"": but W and K? And C? C eliminated. Skip.

""CREPT"": C eliminated? Skip.

""GREVE"": not a common word? 

""CRUDE"": C eliminated? Skip.

""FRIES"": F, R, I, E, S -> here we put E at position4? So the word: F, R, I, E, S? Structure: 
- Position1: F
- Position2: R (correct)
- Position3: I
- Position4: E (so we test E at position4? This is new? And position5: S.

Also, F, I, S are new letters? So we test three new letters? And E at a new position? 

Another candidate: ""PRIME"": P, R, I, M, E -> but E at position5? We avoid E at position5? 

But ""PRIME"" would have E at position5? We could use ""PRIDE"": but D? And E at end? 

Wait, let's stick to ""FRIES"": 
- F (new)
- R (known)
- I (new)
- E (in word but position? putting at position4, which is new?)
- S (new)

So we get feedback on F, I, E, S? And E at position4? 

Alternatively, ""TRIED"": T, R, I, E, D -> E at position4? Yes? And D new.

""TRIED"" seems valid? 

But E is at position4? So we can see if E is at position4? 

Given the options, I think ""TRIED"" or ""GRIME"" might work? But ""GRIME"": G, R, I, M, E -> E at end? 

I prefer ""TRIED"": T, R, I, E, D -> 
- T
- R (correct)
- I
- E (at position4)
- D

But we don't test S? But we can test S later? 

Given our goal, I think ""ERUPT"" is fine? But let me check:

""ERUPT"": 
- Position1: E
- Position2: R (will be ✓)
- Position3: U
- Position4: P
- Position5: T

If E is at position1, then feedback gives ✓ for E? Else if E is not at position1, then '-' because E is in the word? Or if not at position1, but in another position? 

This way we test E in position1? Which is one candidate position? 

Alternatively, if the secret word has E at position3? Then we don't test position3? 

But with ""ERUPT"", we test E at position1? And positions 3,4,5 with U,P,T? 

For strategic reasons, using a word that tests E at another position? We know E is not at position5? And we tested CRANE? So E at position1? That's one candidate? 

But E could be at position3? Or position4? 

Given that we want to test E at a position we haven't tried? Position1? We haven't tried? 

Also, ""ERUPT"" only has 5 distinct letters? So that's good? 

Moreover, it avoids eliminated letters? 

Hence, I choose ""ERUPT""? 

Alternative: ""FRAME"": but A eliminated? 

""CRANE"" eliminated? 

""FRECK"": C eliminated? 

We must avoid A, C, N. 

So ""ERUPT"" is acceptable? 

But let me think of other words: 

- ""TRIPE"": T, R, I, P, E -> but E at end? 

""TRIPE"": E at position5? We know it will be '-' again? So not informative?

Better to put E in a new position?

Put E in position4: ""WORSE""? W, O, R, S, E -> but second letter O? We need R at second position? 

Only words with R as second letter: 

So ""TERSE"": T, E, R, S, E -> repeated E? and R at third position? Not second.

Words with R as second letter: 
- PRIZE: P, R, I, Z, E -> E at end? 
- BRINE: B, R, I, N, E -> N eliminated? Skip.

So after considering, I think ""ERUPT"" is a good choice? Or perhaps ""TRIBE"": but E at end? 

Another word: ""PRESET"": too long? We need 5-letter word.

Finally, let me pick ""BRIDE"": B, R, I, D, E -> E at end? Same issue? 

""GRIME"": G, R, I, M, E -> E at end? 

Which brings me back? 

Perhaps accept E at the end? We know E will be '-'? But what if the word has E elsewhere? We get info? Actually, if we get E at position5 as - again? That doesn't tell us anything new? But we test the new letters.

Therefore, let me pick a word that tests new letters and doesn't care about E at end? Because we know E is in the word? And we can deduce from the feedback? 

So ""PRIME"" is: P, R, I, M, E? 

But M and P and I? 

Or ""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E -> E at end.

Similarly, ""TRUCE"": C eliminated? 

Then I'll choose ""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E. 

But let me do ""PRICE"" doesn't work? 

Avoid C? 

Better: ""BRUME"": not common? 

Perhaps ""WRITE"": W, R, I, T, E -> yes? With E at end? 

But W, I, T are new? 

So ""WRITE"": 
- Position1: W
- Position2: R (will be ✓)
- Position3: I
- Position4: T
- Position5: E (we know '-' will appear for E? But that's okay? then the feedback for I and T? And W? 

Alternatively, we have a word that tests E in a different position? 

But from the available choices, ""ERUPT"" tests E in position1? Which is good? 

Let me decide: 

Strategy 1: If we put E in position1? Then feedback: 
 - If E in position1: ✓
 - If not: '-'? But since E is in the word? It will be '-', meaning E is elsewhere? 

That's better? Because we know one more position? 

With ""ERUPT"": 
- If E is at position1? We get ✓
- If not? Then E is not at position1? So it must be at position 3 or 4? Because we already know it's not at position5? 

That reduces possibilities? 

Also, we test U, P, T? Which are common letters? 

So I think ""ERUPT"" is a good guess? 

Therefore, I'll go with ""ERUPT"". 

If we get ✗ for E? But that cannot happen? Because we already know E is in the word? So E will either be ✓ or '-'. 

Yes? 

So guess: ""ERUPT""Based on the previous feedback for ""CRANE"": 
- R is in the correct position (position 2). 
- E is in the word but not in position 5. 
- C, A, and N are not in the word.

For the next guess:
- I need a word with R in position 2 and E included (but not in position 5). 
- It should avoid C, A, and N to narrow down possibilities. 
- Testing E in position 1 could provide new information: if E is correct there, great; if marked as misplaced, it must be in positions 3 or 4. 
- Words like ""ERUPT"" fit well: it has E in position 1, R in position 2, and tests new letters (U, P, T). This maximizes information gain without repeating eliminated letters.

The guessed word is **""ERUPT""**.

Also, we should consider that the second letter is R.\n\nWe want a word that:\n- Has R in the second position.\n- Includes E (but not at the last position since that gave us \'-\', meaning it\'s elsewhere).\n- Avoids using C, A, N.\n\nMoreover, we want to test other common letters to get more information.\n\nConsider the word structure: _ R _ _ _\n\nSince E is somewhere else, it can be in position 1, 3, or 4.\n\nPossible words: Let\'s try to cover more common letters. Some common consonants are S, T, L, etc.\n\nI propose a guess that has:\n- First position: a letter we want to test (common vowel or consonant) that isn\'t C, A, N.\n- Second position: R (locked)\n- Third position: a new letter, possibly a vowel if we haven\'t tried enough?\n- Fourth position: maybe we can test E here? Or another letter.\n- Fifth position: test another common letter.\n\nBut note: E is already in the word and we know it\'s not at the end. So if we put E in position 4, that would be a good test? Or maybe put it in position 1 or 3 to check.\n\nAlternatively, we might avoid putting E in the same position again? Actually, we can put it in different positions to see.\n\nAim for words that have E and common consonants.\n\nExample words: \n- ""PERCH"" - but C is eliminated? C is not allowed. We must avoid C, A, N.\n- ""BERTH"" - has B, E, R, T, H. But second letter is E, which would conflict? Wait, we need R in the second position.\n\nWe need the word to have R in the second position. So the second letter must be R.\n\nPossible words: \n- BREVE: has E but the second letter is R? BREVE: B, R, E, V, E. But it has repeated E? Also, E at the end? We know E is not at the end? But in the word, we have E at positions 3 and 5. Position 5 is the same as last time? The feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5? Actually, our guess had E at position 5 and it was marked as \'-\' meaning E is in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at position 5 again, it would again be wrong position? We know that, but it also tells us nothing new? We want to test E at other positions.\n\nBut we shouldn\'t repeat the same mistake? Actually, if we put E at position 5 again, we know it will be wrong position, so we avoid that? We can test E in other positions instead.\n\nSo for the next guess, let\'s place E in a different position, such as position 4 or 1.\n\nAlso, we must avoid C, A, N.\n\nI\'ll brainstorm words that fit:\n- One word: ""PRIME"" - P, R, I, M, E. But structure: position1: P, position2: R, position3: I, position4: M, position5: E? But wait, the feedback from first guess said E is not at position 5? So if we put E at position5, we know it will be \'-\' again? And we don\'t learn the actual position? So better not to have E at position5.\n\nInstead, we can put E at position 1: like ""ERASE"" - E, R, A, S, E. But A is eliminated? So we cannot use A.\n\nAlternatively, ""E"" at position 3: e.g., ""TREES"" - has repeated E? and second letter R, but the word has two E\'s? Not good because we want unique letters? Actually, repeated letters are allowed in words, but for testing, it might complicate the feedback? So if possible, avoid repeated letters.\n\nAnother word: ""PRICE"" - but C is eliminated? No, we cannot use C.\n\nSo eliminate C, A, N.\n\nConsider words starting with:\n- Position 1: allow letters that are common and not eliminated. Possible: B, D, E, ... etc.\n- Position 2: R\n- Position 3: a new vowel? We haven\'t tried I, O, U? Or consonants?\n- Position 4: E? Let\'s try E at position 4 to see if that\'s the spot? Or skip E and just include it elsewhere?\n\nActually, we must include E because we know it\'s in the word. So we have to include E.\n\nIdea: put E at position 1. Then we test if E is the first letter? Then the word would be E R ? ? ?\n\nBut position5: we must avoid something that was eliminated? And not the same as others.\n\nPossible guesses: \n- ""ERRED"": has R at position2 and E at position1? But ERRED: E, R, R, E, D - repeated R? And no new letters? Not ideal.\n\nAnother: ""BERTH"": B, E, R, T, H - but then E is at position1? And R at position2? That\'s the structure we need? The word: B (1), E (2)? Wait no, the positions: \n- Position1: B\n- Position2: R\n- Position3: E  --- here we put E at position3. That\'s new? Then position4: T, position5: H.\n\nSo the word is B, R, E, T, H -> ""BRETH""? Is that a word? Actually, it\'s ""BERTH"", but spelled B-E-R-T-H? No, ""BERTH"" is B,E,R,T,H? Then positions: \n- Letter1: B\n- Letter2: E? Oh, wait, if we have ""BERTH"", it is:\n- Position1: B\n- Position2: E (not R) -> but we need R at position2. So we cannot use ""BERTH"" because the second letter is E, not R.\n\nWe need the word to have R in the second position. So we must have R at index 1 (if we count from 0, but in position 2: second slot).\n\nSo words like: X, R, Y, Z, W\n\nLet me think of common words that start with R at second position. For example:\n- PRICE (but C eliminated)\n- TREND: T, R, E, N, D -> but N is eliminated? N is not allowed.\n\nAnother: ""CRUST"" -> but C eliminated.\n\n""ARISE"" but A eliminated? A is not allowed.\n\nSo we avoid A, C, N.\n\nLook for words: _ R _ _ _\n\nWith E somewhere? And no A, C, N.\n\nPossible words:\n- DRESS: D, R, E, S, S -> repeated S? And S at position4 and 5? But we might test S.\n- Alternatively: ""DRESS"" is okay? But repeated letters? Not ideal for testing.\n\n""BREVE"": B, R, E, V, E -> repeated E? And E at end? But we know E not at end? So we want to avoid E at end? But if we put E at position3 and position5? Then we have two E\'s? But the secret word has E? We don\'t know how many E\'s? It might have multiple E\'s? Or only one? We don\'t know.\n\nActually, we don\'t know the multiplicity. To simplify, let\'s avoid repeated letters if possible.\n\nTry ""PRUDE"": P, R, U, D, E -> U and D are new? And E at end? Again, E at position5 we already know is wrong? But we don\'t know if putting E at position4? Wait, in PRUDE: positions: \n1: P\n2: R\n3: U\n4: D\n5: E\n\nBut putting E at position5 we know is wrong? So if we get feedback E: \'-\' again, that doesn\'t give new info? So better to put E at positions 1, 3, or 4.\n\nSo let\'s choose a word with E at position1: E R ? ? ?\n\nBut first letter E: and second R? Then the word would be E R ... ? \n\nWord: ""ERASE"" -> E, R, A, S, E -> but A eliminated? And E repeated? Not good.\n\n""ERROR"": E, R, R, O, R -> repeated R? Not good.\n\n""ERUPT"": E, R, U, P, T -> U and P and T are new? And no repeated letters? Also, avoids C,A,N.\n\nIs ""ERUPT"" a valid word? Yes, meaning: to erupt volcano? So I think so.\n\nAlternatively, ""ERECT"": E, R, E, C, T -> repeated E and C eliminated.\n\nTherefore, ""ERUPT"" seems good: \n- Position1: E -> we test if it\'s the first letter? Feedback: if it is ✓, then E is at position1? Or if \' - \' then E is elsewhere? Either way we get info.\n- Position2: R -> we already know R is at position2? So it should be ✓? But wait, let\'s see: the feedback might tell us it\'s correct? Actually, we know R is in the word and at position2? So when we put R at position2, it will be ✓ because it\'s correct? But that\'s redundant? We are using one of our guesses? Although it confirms? Actually, we won\'t get new info for R? But that\'s okay? Because we are forced to put R at position2? \n\nAlternatively, we can skip putting E at position1 and put it elsewhere? Let me see if we can test E at position3 or 4 without violating.\n\nAnother word: ""TRIBE"": T, R, I, B, E -> then E at position5? We know that E is not at position5? So we get \'-\' again? But that\'s not helpful? And we could have tested E at another position? So better to avoid E at position5.\n\nPut E at position4: e.g., ""PRONE"": P, R, O, N, E -> but N eliminated? Skip.\n\n""TRICE"": T, R, I, C, E -> C eliminated.\n\n""BRUTE"": B, R, U, T, E -> E at position5? Again, same problem? But if we do this, we might get E at position5 marked as \'-\' which we already know? So why not? Actually, we test U and T? But we don\'t test E in a new position? \n\nBut we can get feedback for U and T? So that\'s valuable? The E at position5 will just get \'-\', which we know? So it doesn\'t harm? But we might miss testing E in other positions? We have limited guesses.\n\nAnother idea: put E at position3. For example, ""WRECK"": but W and K? And C? C eliminated. Skip.\n\n""CREPT"": C eliminated? Skip.\n\n""GREVE"": not a common word? \n\n""CRUDE"": C eliminated? Skip.\n\n""FRIES"": F, R, I, E, S -> here we put E at position4? So the word: F, R, I, E, S? Structure: \n- Position1: F\n- Position2: R (correct)\n- Position3: I\n- Position4: E (so we test E at position4? This is new? And position5: S.\n\nAlso, F, I, S are new letters? So we test three new letters? And E at a new position? \n\nAnother candidate: ""PRIME"": P, R, I, M, E -> but E at position5? We avoid E at position5? \n\nBut ""PRIME"" would have E at position5? We could use ""PRIDE"": but D? And E at end? \n\nWait, let\'s stick to ""FRIES"": \n- F (new)\n- R (known)\n- I (new)\n- E (in word but position? putting at position4, which is new?)\n- S (new)\n\nSo we get feedback on F, I, E, S? And E at position4? \n\nAlternatively, ""TRIED"": T, R, I, E, D -> E at position4? Yes? And D new.\n\n""TRIED"" seems valid? \n\nBut E is at position4? So we can see if E is at position4? \n\nGiven the options, I think ""TRIED"" or ""GRIME"" might work? But ""GRIME"": G, R, I, M, E -> E at end? \n\nI prefer ""TRIED"": T, R, I, E, D -> \n- T\n- R (correct)\n- I\n- E (at position4)\n- D\n\nBut we don\'t test S? But we can test S later? \n\nGiven our goal, I think ""ERUPT"" is fine? But let me check:\n\n""ERUPT"": \n- Position1: E\n- Position2: R (will be ✓)\n- Position3: U\n- Position4: P\n- Position5: T\n\nIf E is at position1, then feedback gives ✓ for E? Else if E is not at position1, then \'-\' because E is in the word? Or if not at position1, but in another position? \n\nThis way we test E in position1? Which is one candidate position? \n\nAlternatively, if the secret word has E at position3? Then we don\'t test position3? \n\nBut with ""ERUPT"", we test E at position1? And positions 3,4,5 with U,P,T? \n\nFor strategic reasons, using a word that tests E at another position? We know E is not at position5? And we tested CRANE? So E at position1? That\'s one candidate? \n\nBut E could be at position3? Or position4? \n\nGiven that we want to test E at a position we haven\'t tried? Position1? We haven\'t tried? \n\nAlso, ""ERUPT"" only has 5 distinct letters?

We have the following feedback from two guesses:

1. Guess 1: CRANE
   - C: not in the word (x)
   - R: correct position (✓) at position 2
   - A: not in the word (x)
   - N: not in the word (x)
   - E: in the word but wrong position (-) -> so E is in the word, but not at position 5

2. Guess 2: ERUPT
   - E: in the word but wrong position (-) -> so E is present, but not at position 1 (since we guessed it at position 1 and got '-')
   - R: correct position (✓) at position 2 (as before)
   - U: not in the word (x)
   - P: not in the word (x)
   - T: not in the word (x)

What we know so far:
- The secret word has the letter R in the second position (index 1).
- The letter E is in the word, but not at position 1 or 5 (from ERUPT and CRANE feedback). Therefore, E must be at position 3 or 4.
- Eliminated letters: C, A, N, U, P, T (since they got 'x' in both guesses). We must avoid these in future guesses.
- We have not tested many other common letters, such as S, D, L, O, I, M, B, G, H, etc.

The word structure: 
Position 1: ? (cannot be E, and not C, A, N, U, P, T)
Position 2: R (fixed)
Position 3: ? (could be E, or another letter? but E must be at 3 or 4)
Position 4: ? (could be E, or another letter? but E must be at 3 or 4)
Position 5: ? (cannot be E, and not C, A, N, U, P, T)

Since E must be at position 3 or 4, we can consider two cases. However, for the next guess, we want to test which of these positions E is in and also test other common letters.

We also need to avoid the eliminated letters: C, A, N, U, P, T.

Possible strategy:
- Since E is at position 3 or 4, we can try to put E at position 3 in the next guess to see if it's correct. If it is, then we know E is at 3; if not, then E must be at 4.
- Alternatively, we can put E at position 4 to test that.
- But we also want to test other letters to maximize information.

Given that we have only 4 guesses left, we should aim to cover as many new letters as possible.

Let's think of words that have:
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: E (to test if E is at 3) OR position 4: E (to test if E is at 4)
- And use other common letters that we haven't tested.

We haven't tested: S, D, L, O, I, M, B, G, H, Y, etc.

Option 1: Test E at position 3.
Word pattern: _ R E _ _

We need to fill position 1, 4, and 5 with new letters (avoiding C,A,N,U,P,T).

Possible words:
- ""BREED"" -> but repeated E? and D at the end? But we don't know if E is repeated? But we want to avoid repetition for testing? Also, B is new.
- ""GREED"" -> similar, repeated E? and G and D.
- ""CREED"" -> C is eliminated? Skip.
- ""FREED"" -> F and D? But repeated E? Not ideal.

Better to avoid repeated letters? So let's try to find a word with E at position 3 and distinct letters.

""BREDE"" is not common? 

""TREED"" -> T is eliminated? Skip.

""BREME"" -> not common.

""DRESS"" has E at position 3? D, R, E, S, S -> repeated S? and S at two positions? But we can use it? However, we are testing E at position 3? And D and S? But S is common.

But ""DRESS"": 
- Position1: D
- Position2: R
- Position3: E
- Position4: S
- Position5: S

Repeated S? Not ideal for testing? 

Another word: ""BREWS"": B, R, E, W, S -> E at position3? Then W and S? And avoids eliminated letters? 

""BREWS"" is a word? Brews? Yes, meaning makes beer? 

So ""BREWS"": 
- B (new)
- R (known)
- E (at position3, testing if E is at 3)
- W (new)
- S (new)

If E is at position3, we get ✓ for E? If not, then we get '-' meaning E is at position4? And we also get feedback on B, W, S.

But if E is not at position3, then it must be at position4? Because we know E is at 3 or 4? So if we get '-' for E in position3, then E is at position4? 

Similarly, if we get ✓ for E at position3, then we know E is at 3? 

So this guess will tell us exactly where E is? 

Moreover, we test B, W, S? 

But we have position4 and 5 to fill? 

Alternatively, we can test E at position4? 

Option 2: Test E at position4.
Word pattern: _ R _ E _

Possible words: 
- ""DRIES"": D, R, I, E, S -> I and S? 
- ""TRIES"": T eliminated? Skip.
- ""FRIES"": F, R, I, E, S -> F, I, S? 
- ""GRIES"": not common? 
- ""BRIES"": not common? 

""FRIES"" is good: 
- F (new)
- R (known)
- I (new)
- E (at position4, testing if E is at 4)
- S (new)

Similarly, if E is at position4, we get ✓? If not, then E must be at position3? 

So both options are symmetric? 

But we also need to consider the frequency of letters? 

S is a very common letter? So testing S is good? 

Similarly, B, F, I, W are common? 

I think both ""BREWS"" and ""FRIES"" are good? 

But in ""BREWS"", we test E at position3? And in ""FRIES"", at position4? 

Since we don't know which one, we can choose either? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests both possibilities? But that's not possible? Because E can only be at one position? 

We have to choose one? 

But note: we have to avoid eliminated letters? 

Another word: ""ORIEL"": O, R, I, E, L -> E at position4? And O, I, L? 

But ""ORIEL"" is a word? Yes, meaning a type of window? 

But we haven't tested O, I, L? 

But S is more common? 

I think ""FRIES"" is a good choice? 

But let me see the feedback from the first guess: we had E at position5? And now we are testing E at position4? 

But we know E is not at position1 or 5? So positions 3 and 4 are the only possibilities? 

Therefore, I'll go with ""FRIES"" to test E at position4? 

But we also get to test F, I, S? 

Alternatively, ""BRIDE"": but E at end? We know E is not at end? So we cannot put E at end? Because we know it will be misplaced? 

In ""FRIES"", E is at position4? So that's fine? 

But ""FRIES"" has E at position4? 

Yes? 

So I choose ""FRIES""? 

But let me confirm: 
- Position1: F
- Position2: R (will be ✓)
- Position3: I
- Position4: E (test if E is at 4)
- Position5: S

If we get feedback:
- If E is at position4: ✓
- If not: then E must be at position3? 

Also, we get feedback on F, I, S? 

But what if the word has I or S? 

So it's good? 

But we have to avoid eliminated letters? F, I, S are not eliminated? 

So ""FRIES"" is valid? 

But let me think of other words? 

""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E -> but E at end? We know E is not at end? So we cannot use E at position5? Because we know it will be misplaced? And we don't learn new about E? 

So we should avoid putting E at position5? 

Therefore, ""FRIES"" is better? 

Another word: ""BRIEF"": B, R, I, E, F -> E at position4? And F at end? 

""BRIEF"": 
- Position1: B
- Position2: R
- Position3: I
- Position4: E
- Position5: F

Same as ""FRIES"" but with B and F? 

But ""BRIEF"" has F at position5? 

I think both are fine? 

But ""FRIES"" has S? Which is more common? 

I'll go with ""FRIES"". 

But we have to make sure? 

Alternatively, ""GRIME"": but E at end? Skip. 

""PRIDE"": P eliminated? Skip. 

So ""FRIES"" is a good choice? 

But in ""FRIES"", we have I at position3? 

We don't know if I is in the word? 

So I think it's fine? 

Therefore, next guess: ""FRIES"" 

But let me write it: F-R-I-E-S

So <guess>FRIES</guess> 

But we have to output in the format? 

But I think we should consider: what if the word has E at position3? Then in ""FRIES"", E is at position4? So we get '-' for E? Meaning E is misplaced? But we know it must be at position3? So we don't lose much? 

Similarly, if E is at position4, we get ✓? 

So it's efficient? 

Yes? 

Therefore, I'll go with that.

After analyzing the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(-)  
  - R is in the word and correctly placed at position 2.  
  - E is in the word but not at position 5.  
  - C, A, and N are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: ERUPT** → Feedback: E(-), R(✓), U(x), P(x), T(x)  
  - E is in the word but not at position 1 (since it was marked as misplaced at position 1).  
  - R is still correctly placed at position 2.  
  - U, P, and T are not in the word.  

### Key Insights:
1. **R is fixed at position 2**: The secret word has the structure `_ R _ _ _`.
2. **E is in the word but not at positions 1 or 5**: From the feedback, E must be at position 3 or 4.
3. **Eliminated letters**: C, A, N, U, P, T are not in the word. Avoid using these.
4. **New letters to test**: Focus on common untested letters like S, D, I, O, L, M, B, G, H, etc.
5. **Strategy for next guess**: 
   - Test E at position 4 to determine if it belongs there (if not, E must be at position 3).
   - Include other high-frequency letters to maximize information gain (e.g., S, I, F).
   - Avoid eliminated letters and positions where E is confirmed absent.

The word **""FRIES""** fits well:
- Position 2: R (correct placement).
- Position 4: E (tests if E is at position 4; if not, E must be at position 3).
- Tests new common letters: F (position 1), I (position 3), and S (position 5).
- Avoids eliminated letters (C, A, N, U, P, T).

This guess will clarify E's position and provide feedback on F, I, and S, narrowing down possibilities significantly.

<guess>FRIES</guess>",FRIES,"We have the following feedback from two guesses:

1. Guess 1: CRANE
   - C: not in the word (x)
   - R: correct position (✓) at position 2
   - A: not in the word (x)
   - N: not in the word (x)
   - E: in the word but wrong position (-) -> so E is in the word, but not at position 5

2. Guess 2: ERUPT
   - E: in the word but wrong position (-) -> so E is present, but not at position 1 (since we guessed it at position 1 and got '-')
   - R: correct position (✓) at position 2 (as before)
   - U: not in the word (x)
   - P: not in the word (x)
   - T: not in the word (x)

What we know so far:
- The secret word has the letter R in the second position (index 1).
- The letter E is in the word, but not at position 1 or 5 (from ERUPT and CRANE feedback). Therefore, E must be at position 3 or 4.
- Eliminated letters: C, A, N, U, P, T (since they got 'x' in both guesses). We must avoid these in future guesses.
- We have not tested many other common letters, such as S, D, L, O, I, M, B, G, H, etc.

The word structure: 
Position 1: ? (cannot be E, and not C, A, N, U, P, T)
Position 2: R (fixed)
Position 3: ? (could be E, or another letter? but E must be at 3 or 4)
Position 4: ? (could be E, or another letter? but E must be at 3 or 4)
Position 5: ? (cannot be E, and not C, A, N, U, P, T)

Since E must be at position 3 or 4, we can consider two cases. However, for the next guess, we want to test which of these positions E is in and also test other common letters.

We also need to avoid the eliminated letters: C, A, N, U, P, T.

Possible strategy:
- Since E is at position 3 or 4, we can try to put E at position 3 in the next guess to see if it's correct. If it is, then we know E is at 3; if not, then E must be at 4.
- Alternatively, we can put E at position 4 to test that.
- But we also want to test other letters to maximize information.

Given that we have only 4 guesses left, we should aim to cover as many new letters as possible.

Let's think of words that have:
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: E (to test if E is at 3) OR position 4: E (to test if E is at 4)
- And use other common letters that we haven't tested.

We haven't tested: S, D, L, O, I, M, B, G, H, Y, etc.

Option 1: Test E at position 3.
Word pattern: _ R E _ _

We need to fill position 1, 4, and 5 with new letters (avoiding C,A,N,U,P,T).

Possible words:
- ""BREED"" -> but repeated E? and D at the end? But we don't know if E is repeated? But we want to avoid repetition for testing? Also, B is new.
- ""GREED"" -> similar, repeated E? and G and D.
- ""CREED"" -> C is eliminated? Skip.
- ""FREED"" -> F and D? But repeated E? Not ideal.

Better to avoid repeated letters? So let's try to find a word with E at position 3 and distinct letters.

""BREDE"" is not common? 

""TREED"" -> T is eliminated? Skip.

""BREME"" -> not common.

""DRESS"" has E at position 3? D, R, E, S, S -> repeated S? and S at two positions? But we can use it? However, we are testing E at position 3? And D and S? But S is common.

But ""DRESS"": 
- Position1: D
- Position2: R
- Position3: E
- Position4: S
- Position5: S

Repeated S? Not ideal for testing? 

Another word: ""BREWS"": B, R, E, W, S -> E at position3? Then W and S? And avoids eliminated letters? 

""BREWS"" is a word? Brews? Yes, meaning makes beer? 

So ""BREWS"": 
- B (new)
- R (known)
- E (at position3, testing if E is at 3)
- W (new)
- S (new)

If E is at position3, we get ✓ for E? If not, then we get '-' meaning E is at position4? And we also get feedback on B, W, S.

But if E is not at position3, then it must be at position4? Because we know E is at 3 or 4? So if we get '-' for E in position3, then E is at position4? 

Similarly, if we get ✓ for E at position3, then we know E is at 3? 

So this guess will tell us exactly where E is? 

Moreover, we test B, W, S? 

But we have position4 and 5 to fill? 

Alternatively, we can test E at position4? 

Option 2: Test E at position4.
Word pattern: _ R _ E _

Possible words: 
- ""DRIES"": D, R, I, E, S -> I and S? 
- ""TRIES"": T eliminated? Skip.
- ""FRIES"": F, R, I, E, S -> F, I, S? 
- ""GRIES"": not common? 
- ""BRIES"": not common? 

""FRIES"" is good: 
- F (new)
- R (known)
- I (new)
- E (at position4, testing if E is at 4)
- S (new)

Similarly, if E is at position4, we get ✓? If not, then E must be at position3? 

So both options are symmetric? 

But we also need to consider the frequency of letters? 

S is a very common letter? So testing S is good? 

Similarly, B, F, I, W are common? 

I think both ""BREWS"" and ""FRIES"" are good? 

But in ""BREWS"", we test E at position3? And in ""FRIES"", at position4? 

Since we don't know which one, we can choose either? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests both possibilities? But that's not possible? Because E can only be at one position? 

We have to choose one? 

But note: we have to avoid eliminated letters? 

Another word: ""ORIEL"": O, R, I, E, L -> E at position4? And O, I, L? 

But ""ORIEL"" is a word? Yes, meaning a type of window? 

But we haven't tested O, I, L? 

But S is more common? 

I think ""FRIES"" is a good choice? 

But let me see the feedback from the first guess: we had E at position5? And now we are testing E at position4? 

But we know E is not at position1 or 5? So positions 3 and 4 are the only possibilities? 

Therefore, I'll go with ""FRIES"" to test E at position4? 

But we also get to test F, I, S? 

Alternatively, ""BRIDE"": but E at end? We know E is not at end? So we cannot put E at end? Because we know it will be misplaced? 

In ""FRIES"", E is at position4? So that's fine? 

But ""FRIES"" has E at position4? 

Yes? 

So I choose ""FRIES""? 

But let me confirm: 
- Position1: F
- Position2: R (will be ✓)
- Position3: I
- Position4: E (test if E is at 4)
- Position5: S

If we get feedback:
- If E is at position4: ✓
- If not: then E must be at position3? 

Also, we get feedback on F, I, S? 

But what if the word has I or S? 

So it's good? 

But we have to avoid eliminated letters? F, I, S are not eliminated? 

So ""FRIES"" is valid? 

But let me think of other words? 

""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E -> but E at end? We know E is not at end? So we cannot use E at position5? Because we know it will be misplaced? And we don't learn new about E? 

So we should avoid putting E at position5? 

Therefore, ""FRIES"" is better? 

Another word: ""BRIEF"": B, R, I, E, F -> E at position4? And F at end? 

""BRIEF"": 
- Position1: B
- Position2: R
- Position3: I
- Position4: E
- Position5: F

Same as ""FRIES"" but with B and F? 

But ""BRIEF"" has F at position5? 

I think both are fine? 

But ""FRIES"" has S? Which is more common? 

I'll go with ""FRIES"". 

But we have to make sure? 

Alternatively, ""GRIME"": but E at end? Skip. 

""PRIDE"": P eliminated? Skip. 

So ""FRIES"" is a good choice? 

But in ""FRIES"", we have I at position3? 

We don't know if I is in the word? 

So I think it's fine? 

Therefore, next guess: ""FRIES"" 

But let me write it: F-R-I-E-S

So <guess>FRIES</guess> 

But we have to output in the format? 

But I think we should consider: what if the word has E at position3? Then in ""FRIES"", E is at position4? So we get '-' for E? Meaning E is misplaced? But we know it must be at position3? So we don't lose much? 

Similarly, if E is at position4, we get ✓? 

So it's efficient? 

Yes? 

Therefore, I'll go with that.After analyzing the feedback from the previous guesses:

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior information about the secret word. 
 A good first guess should cover common letters and have a balanced set of vowels and consonants.
 One common strategy is to start with words that have common letters and no repeated letters to maximize information.

 Popular starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc. 
 I will choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 Let's go with ""CRANE"" as the first guess.<thinking>
We are making the first guess, so we have no prior information. 
A strategic first guess should:
- Include common vowels (like A, E) and common consonants (like R, S, T).
- Avoid repeating letters to maximize information gain.
- Cover frequent letters in 5-letter words.

The word ""CRANE"" is ideal because:
- It contains three vowels (A and E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).
- All letters are distinct, giving us feedback on five unique letters.
- It's among the top-rated opening words in similar word games (like Wordle).

After this guess, the feedback (✓, -, or x) on each letter will help narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.
</thinking>

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter of the secret word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

What we know so far:
- The secret word has 5 letters.
- The second letter is R (position 2).
- The letter E is in the word, but not at the end (position 5).
- Letters C, A, and N are not in the word.

Since E is present but not at the end, it must be in one of the positions: 1, 3, or 4 (since position 5 is taken by the guess, but it's wrong position).

We also eliminated C, A, N.

For the next guess, we should include E and avoid C, A, N. Also, we should consider that the second letter is R.

We want a word that:
- Has R in the second position.
- Includes E (but not at the last position since that gave us '-', meaning it's elsewhere).
- Avoids using C, A, N.

Moreover, we want to test other common letters to get more information.

Consider the word structure: _ R _ _ _

Since E is somewhere else, it can be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Possible words: Let's try to cover more common letters. Some common consonants are S, T, L, etc.

I propose a guess that has:
- First position: a letter we want to test (common vowel or consonant) that isn't C, A, N.
- Second position: R (locked)
- Third position: a new letter, possibly a vowel if we haven't tried enough?
- Fourth position: maybe we can test E here? Or another letter.
- Fifth position: test another common letter.

But note: E is already in the word and we know it's not at the end. So if we put E in position 4, that would be a good test? Or maybe put it in position 1 or 3 to check.

Alternatively, we might avoid putting E in the same position again? Actually, we can put it in different positions to see.

Aim for words that have E and common consonants.

Example words: 
- ""PERCH"" - but C is eliminated? C is not allowed. We must avoid C, A, N.
- ""BERTH"" - has B, E, R, T, H. But second letter is E, which would conflict? Wait, we need R in the second position.

We need the word to have R in the second position. So the second letter must be R.

Possible words: 
- BREVE: has E but the second letter is R? BREVE: B, R, E, V, E. But it has repeated E? Also, E at the end? We know E is not at the end? But in the word, we have E at positions 3 and 5. Position 5 is the same as last time? The feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5? Actually, our guess had E at position 5 and it was marked as '-' meaning E is in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at position 5 again, it would again be wrong position? We know that, but it also tells us nothing new? We want to test E at other positions.

But we shouldn't repeat the same mistake? Actually, if we put E at position 5 again, we know it will be wrong position, so we avoid that? We can test E in other positions instead.

So for the next guess, let's place E in a different position, such as position 4 or 1.

Also, we must avoid C, A, N.

I'll brainstorm words that fit:
- One word: ""PRIME"" - P, R, I, M, E. But structure: position1: P, position2: R, position3: I, position4: M, position5: E? But wait, the feedback from first guess said E is not at position 5? So if we put E at position5, we know it will be '-' again? And we don't learn the actual position? So better not to have E at position5.

Instead, we can put E at position 1: like ""ERASE"" - E, R, A, S, E. But A is eliminated? So we cannot use A.

Alternatively, ""E"" at position 3: e.g., ""TREES"" - has repeated E? and second letter R, but the word has two E's? Not good because we want unique letters? Actually, repeated letters are allowed in words, but for testing, it might complicate the feedback? So if possible, avoid repeated letters.

Another word: ""PRICE"" - but C is eliminated? No, we cannot use C.

So eliminate C, A, N.

Consider words starting with:
- Position 1: allow letters that are common and not eliminated. Possible: B, D, E, ... etc.
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: a new vowel? We haven't tried I, O, U? Or consonants?
- Position 4: E? Let's try E at position 4 to see if that's the spot? Or skip E and just include it elsewhere?

Actually, we must include E because we know it's in the word. So we have to include E.

Idea: put E at position 1. Then we test if E is the first letter? Then the word would be E R ? ? ?

But position5: we must avoid something that was eliminated? And not the same as others.

Possible guesses: 
- ""ERRED"": has R at position2 and E at position1? But ERRED: E, R, R, E, D - repeated R? And no new letters? Not ideal.

Another: ""BERTH"": B, E, R, T, H - but then E is at position1? And R at position2? That's the structure we need? The word: B (1), E (2)? Wait no, the positions: 
- Position1: B
- Position2: R
- Position3: E  --- here we put E at position3. That's new? Then position4: T, position5: H.

So the word is B, R, E, T, H -> ""BRETH""? Is that a word? Actually, it's ""BERTH"", but spelled B-E-R-T-H? No, ""BERTH"" is B,E,R,T,H? Then positions: 
- Letter1: B
- Letter2: E? Oh, wait, if we have ""BERTH"", it is:
- Position1: B
- Position2: E (not R) -> but we need R at position2. So we cannot use ""BERTH"" because the second letter is E, not R.

We need the word to have R in the second position. So we must have R at index 1 (if we count from 0, but in position 2: second slot).

So words like: X, R, Y, Z, W

Let me think of common words that start with R at second position. For example:
- PRICE (but C eliminated)
- TREND: T, R, E, N, D -> but N is eliminated? N is not allowed.

Another: ""CRUST"" -> but C eliminated.

""ARISE"" but A eliminated? A is not allowed.

So we avoid A, C, N.

Look for words: _ R _ _ _

With E somewhere? And no A, C, N.

Possible words:
- DRESS: D, R, E, S, S -> repeated S? And S at position4 and 5? But we might test S.
- Alternatively: ""DRESS"" is okay? But repeated letters? Not ideal for testing.

""BREVE"": B, R, E, V, E -> repeated E? And E at end? But we know E not at end? So we want to avoid E at end? But if we put E at position3 and position5? Then we have two E's? But the secret word has E? We don't know how many E's? It might have multiple E's? Or only one? We don't know.

Actually, we don't know the multiplicity. To simplify, let's avoid repeated letters if possible.

Try ""PRUDE"": P, R, U, D, E -> U and D are new? And E at end? Again, E at position5 we already know is wrong? But we don't know if putting E at position4? Wait, in PRUDE: positions: 
1: P
2: R
3: U
4: D
5: E

But putting E at position5 we know is wrong? So if we get feedback E: '-' again, that doesn't give new info? So better to put E at positions 1, 3, or 4.

So let's choose a word with E at position1: E R ? ? ?

But first letter E: and second R? Then the word would be E R ... ? 

Word: ""ERASE"" -> E, R, A, S, E -> but A eliminated? And E repeated? Not good.

""ERROR"": E, R, R, O, R -> repeated R? Not good.

""ERUPT"": E, R, U, P, T -> U and P and T are new? And no repeated letters? Also, avoids C,A,N.

Is ""ERUPT"" a valid word? Yes, meaning: to erupt volcano? So I think so.

Alternatively, ""ERECT"": E, R, E, C, T -> repeated E and C eliminated.

Therefore, ""ERUPT"" seems good: 
- Position1: E -> we test if it's the first letter? Feedback: if it is ✓, then E is at position1? Or if ' - ' then E is elsewhere? Either way we get info.
- Position2: R -> we already know R is at position2? So it should be ✓? But wait, let's see: the feedback might tell us it's correct? Actually, we know R is in the word and at position2? So when we put R at position2, it will be ✓ because it's correct? But that's redundant? We are using one of our guesses? Although it confirms? Actually, we won't get new info for R? But that's okay? Because we are forced to put R at position2? 

Alternatively, we can skip putting E at position1 and put it elsewhere? Let me see if we can test E at position3 or 4 without violating.

Another word: ""TRIBE"": T, R, I, B, E -> then E at position5? We know that E is not at position5? So we get '-' again? But that's not helpful? And we could have tested E at another position? So better to avoid E at position5.

Put E at position4: e.g., ""PRONE"": P, R, O, N, E -> but N eliminated? Skip.

""TRICE"": T, R, I, C, E -> C eliminated.

""BRUTE"": B, R, U, T, E -> E at position5? Again, same problem? But if we do this, we might get E at position5 marked as '-' which we already know? So why not? Actually, we test U and T? But we don't test E in a new position? 

But we can get feedback for U and T? So that's valuable? The E at position5 will just get '-', which we know? So it doesn't harm? But we might miss testing E in other positions? We have limited guesses.

Another idea: put E at position3. For example, ""WRECK"": but W and K? And C? C eliminated. Skip.

""CREPT"": C eliminated? Skip.

""GREVE"": not a common word? 

""CRUDE"": C eliminated? Skip.

""FRIES"": F, R, I, E, S -> here we put E at position4? So the word: F, R, I, E, S? Structure: 
- Position1: F
- Position2: R (correct)
- Position3: I
- Position4: E (so we test E at position4? This is new? And position5: S.

Also, F, I, S are new letters? So we test three new letters? And E at a new position? 

Another candidate: ""PRIME"": P, R, I, M, E -> but E at position5? We avoid E at position5? 

But ""PRIME"" would have E at position5? We could use ""PRIDE"": but D? And E at end? 

Wait, let's stick to ""FRIES"": 
- F (new)
- R (known)
- I (new)
- E (in word but position? putting at position4, which is new?)
- S (new)

So we get feedback on F, I, E, S? And E at position4? 

Alternatively, ""TRIED"": T, R, I, E, D -> E at position4? Yes? And D new.

""TRIED"" seems valid? 

But E is at position4? So we can see if E is at position4? 

Given the options, I think ""TRIED"" or ""GRIME"" might work? But ""GRIME"": G, R, I, M, E -> E at end? 

I prefer ""TRIED"": T, R, I, E, D -> 
- T
- R (correct)
- I
- E (at position4)
- D

But we don't test S? But we can test S later? 

Given our goal, I think ""ERUPT"" is fine? But let me check:

""ERUPT"": 
- Position1: E
- Position2: R (will be ✓)
- Position3: U
- Position4: P
- Position5: T

If E is at position1, then feedback gives ✓ for E? Else if E is not at position1, then '-' because E is in the word? Or if not at position1, but in another position? 

This way we test E in position1? Which is one candidate position? 

Alternatively, if the secret word has E at position3? Then we don't test position3? 

But with ""ERUPT"", we test E at position1? And positions 3,4,5 with U,P,T? 

For strategic reasons, using a word that tests E at another position? We know E is not at position5? And we tested CRANE? So E at position1? That's one candidate? 

But E could be at position3? Or position4? 

Given that we want to test E at a position we haven't tried? Position1? We haven't tried? 

Also, ""ERUPT"" only has 5 distinct letters? So that's good? 

Moreover, it avoids eliminated letters? 

Hence, I choose ""ERUPT""? 

Alternative: ""FRAME"": but A eliminated? 

""CRANE"" eliminated? 

""FRECK"": C eliminated? 

We must avoid A, C, N. 

So ""ERUPT"" is acceptable? 

But let me think of other words: 

- ""TRIPE"": T, R, I, P, E -> but E at end? 

""TRIPE"": E at position5? We know it will be '-' again? So not informative?

Better to put E in a new position?

Put E in position4: ""WORSE""? W, O, R, S, E -> but second letter O? We need R at second position? 

Only words with R as second letter: 

So ""TERSE"": T, E, R, S, E -> repeated E? and R at third position? Not second.

Words with R as second letter: 
- PRIZE: P, R, I, Z, E -> E at end? 
- BRINE: B, R, I, N, E -> N eliminated? Skip.

So after considering, I think ""ERUPT"" is a good choice? Or perhaps ""TRIBE"": but E at end? 

Another word: ""PRESET"": too long? We need 5-letter word.

Finally, let me pick ""BRIDE"": B, R, I, D, E -> E at end? Same issue? 

""GRIME"": G, R, I, M, E -> E at end? 

Which brings me back? 

Perhaps accept E at the end? We know E will be '-'? But what if the word has E elsewhere? We get info? Actually, if we get E at position5 as - again? That doesn't tell us anything new? But we test the new letters.

Therefore, let me pick a word that tests new letters and doesn't care about E at end? Because we know E is in the word? And we can deduce from the feedback? 

So ""PRIME"" is: P, R, I, M, E? 

But M and P and I? 

Or ""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E -> E at end.

Similarly, ""TRUCE"": C eliminated? 

Then I'll choose ""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E. 

But let me do ""PRICE"" doesn't work? 

Avoid C? 

Better: ""BRUME"": not common? 

Perhaps ""WRITE"": W, R, I, T, E -> yes? With E at end? 

But W, I, T are new? 

So ""WRITE"": 
- Position1: W
- Position2: R (will be ✓)
- Position3: I
- Position4: T
- Position5: E (we know '-' will appear for E? But that's okay? then the feedback for I and T? And W? 

Alternatively, we have a word that tests E in a different position? 

But from the available choices, ""ERUPT"" tests E in position1? Which is good? 

Let me decide: 

Strategy 1: If we put E in position1? Then feedback: 
 - If E in position1: ✓
 - If not: '-'? But since E is in the word? It will be '-', meaning E is elsewhere? 

That's better? Because we know one more position? 

With ""ERUPT"": 
- If E is at position1? We get ✓
- If not? Then E is not at position1? So it must be at position 3 or 4? Because we already know it's not at position5? 

That reduces possibilities? 

Also, we test U, P, T? Which are common letters? 

So I think ""ERUPT"" is a good guess? 

Therefore, I'll go with ""ERUPT"". 

If we get ✗ for E? But that cannot happen? Because we already know E is in the word? So E will either be ✓ or '-'. 

Yes? 

So guess: ""ERUPT""Based on the previous feedback for ""CRANE"": 
- R is in the correct position (position 2). 
- E is in the word but not in position 5. 
- C, A, and N are not in the word.

For the next guess:
- I need a word with R in position 2 and E included (but not in position 5). 
- It should avoid C, A, and N to narrow down possibilities. 
- Testing E in position 1 could provide new information: if E is correct there, great; if marked as misplaced, it must be in positions 3 or 4. 
- Words like ""ERUPT"" fit well: it has E in position 1, R in position 2, and tests new letters (U, P, T). This maximizes information gain without repeating eliminated letters.

The guessed word is **""ERUPT""**.

<guess>ERUPT</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: ERUPT -> FEEDBACK: E(-) R(✓) U(x) P(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the following feedback from two guesses:

1. Guess 1: CRANE
   - C: not in the word (x)
   - R: correct position (✓) at position 2
   - A: not in the word (x)
   - N: not in the word (x)
   - E: in the word but wrong position (-) -> so E is in the word, but not at position 5

2. Guess 2: ERUPT
   - E: in the word but wrong position (-) -> so E is present, but not at position 1 (since we guessed it at position 1 and got '-')
   - R: correct position (✓) at position 2 (as before)
   - U: not in the word (x)
   - P: not in the word (x)
   - T: not in the word (x)

What we know so far:
- The secret word has the letter R in the second position (index 1).
- The letter E is in the word, but not at position 1 or 5 (from ERUPT and CRANE feedback). Therefore, E must be at position 3 or 4.
- Eliminated letters: C, A, N, U, P, T (since they got 'x' in both guesses). We must avoid these in future guesses.
- We have not tested many other common letters, such as S, D, L, O, I, M, B, G, H, etc.

The word structure: 
Position 1: ? (cannot be E, and not C, A, N, U, P, T)
Position 2: R (fixed)
Position 3: ? (could be E, or another letter? but E must be at 3 or 4)
Position 4: ? (could be E, or another letter? but E must be at 3 or 4)
Position 5: ? (cannot be E, and not C, A, N, U, P, T)

Since E must be at position 3 or 4, we can consider two cases. However, for the next guess, we want to test which of these positions E is in and also test other common letters.

We also need to avoid the eliminated letters: C, A, N, U, P, T.

Possible strategy:
- Since E is at position 3 or 4, we can try to put E at position 3 in the next guess to see if it's correct. If it is, then we know E is at 3; if not, then E must be at 4.
- Alternatively, we can put E at position 4 to test that.
- But we also want to test other letters to maximize information.

Given that we have only 4 guesses left, we should aim to cover as many new letters as possible.

Let's think of words that have:
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: E (to test if E is at 3) OR position 4: E (to test if E is at 4)
- And use other common letters that we haven't tested.

We haven't tested: S, D, L, O, I, M, B, G, H, Y, etc.

Option 1: Test E at position 3.
Word pattern: _ R E _ _

We need to fill position 1, 4, and 5 with new letters (avoiding C,A,N,U,P,T).

Possible words:
- ""BREED"" -> but repeated E? and D at the end? But we don't know if E is repeated? But we want to avoid repetition for testing? Also, B is new.
- ""GREED"" -> similar, repeated E? and G and D.
- ""CREED"" -> C is eliminated? Skip.
- ""FREED"" -> F and D? But repeated E? Not ideal.

Better to avoid repeated letters? So let's try to find a word with E at position 3 and distinct letters.

""BREDE"" is not common? 

""TREED"" -> T is eliminated? Skip.

""BREME"" -> not common.

""DRESS"" has E at position 3? D, R, E, S, S -> repeated S? and S at two positions? But we can use it? However, we are testing E at position 3? And D and S? But S is common.

But ""DRESS"": 
- Position1: D
- Position2: R
- Position3: E
- Position4: S
- Position5: S

Repeated S? Not ideal for testing? 

Another word: ""BREWS"": B, R, E, W, S -> E at position3? Then W and S? And avoids eliminated letters? 

""BREWS"" is a word? Brews? Yes, meaning makes beer? 

So ""BREWS"": 
- B (new)
- R (known)
- E (at position3, testing if E is at 3)
- W (new)
- S (new)

If E is at position3, we get ✓ for E? If not, then we get '-' meaning E is at position4? And we also get feedback on B, W, S.

But if E is not at position3, then it must be at position4? Because we know E is at 3 or 4? So if we get '-' for E in position3, then E is at position4? 

Similarly, if we get ✓ for E at position3, then we know E is at 3? 

So this guess will tell us exactly where E is? 

Moreover, we test B, W, S? 

But we have position4 and 5 to fill? 

Alternatively, we can test E at position4? 

Option 2: Test E at position4.
Word pattern: _ R _ E _

Possible words: 
- ""DRIES"": D, R, I, E, S -> I and S? 
- ""TRIES"": T eliminated? Skip.
- ""FRIES"": F, R, I, E, S -> F, I, S? 
- ""GRIES"": not common? 
- ""BRIES"": not common? 

""FRIES"" is good: 
- F (new)
- R (known)
- I (new)
- E (at position4, testing if E is at 4)
- S (new)

Similarly, if E is at position4, we get ✓? If not, then E must be at position3? 

So both options are symmetric? 

But we also need to consider the frequency of letters? 

S is a very common letter? So testing S is good? 

Similarly, B, F, I, W are common? 

I think both ""BREWS"" and ""FRIES"" are good? 

But in ""BREWS"", we test E at position3? And in ""FRIES"", at position4? 

Since we don't know which one, we can choose either? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests both possibilities? But that's not possible? Because E can only be at one position? 

We have to choose one? 

But note: we have to avoid eliminated letters? 

Another word: ""ORIEL"": O, R, I, E, L -> E at position4? And O, I, L? 

But ""ORIEL"" is a word? Yes, meaning a type of window? 

But we haven't tested O, I, L? 

But S is more common? 

I think ""FRIES"" is a good choice? 

But let me see the feedback from the first guess: we had E at position5? And now we are testing E at position4? 

But we know E is not at position1 or 5? So positions 3 and 4 are the only possibilities? 

Therefore, I'll go with ""FRIES"" to test E at position4? 

But we also get to test F, I, S? 

Alternatively, ""BRIDE"": but E at end? We know E is not at end? So we cannot put E at end? Because we know it will be misplaced? 

In ""FRIES"", E is at position4? So that's fine? 

But ""FRIES"" has E at position4? 

Yes? 

So I choose ""FRIES""? 

But let me confirm: 
- Position1: F
- Position2: R (will be ✓)
- Position3: I
- Position4: E (test if E is at 4)
- Position5: S

If we get feedback:
- If E is at position4: ✓
- If not: then E must be at position3? 

Also, we get feedback on F, I, S? 

But what if the word has I or S? 

So it's good? 

But we have to avoid eliminated letters? F, I, S are not eliminated? 

So ""FRIES"" is valid? 

But let me think of other words? 

""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E -> but E at end? We know E is not at end? So we cannot use E at position5? Because we know it will be misplaced? And we don't learn new about E? 

So we should avoid putting E at position5? 

Therefore, ""FRIES"" is better? 

Another word: ""BRIEF"": B, R, I, E, F -> E at position4? And F at end? 

""BRIEF"": 
- Position1: B
- Position2: R
- Position3: I
- Position4: E
- Position5: F

Same as ""FRIES"" but with B and F? 

But ""BRIEF"" has F at position5? 

I think both are fine? 

But ""FRIES"" has S? Which is more common? 

I'll go with ""FRIES"". 

But we have to make sure? 

Alternatively, ""GRIME"": but E at end? Skip. 

""PRIDE"": P eliminated? Skip. 

So ""FRIES"" is a good choice? 

But in ""FRIES"", we have I at position3? 

We don't know if I is in the word? 

So I think it's fine? 

Therefore, next guess: ""FRIES"" 

But let me write it: F-R-I-E-S

So <guess>FRIES</guess> 

But we have to output in the format? 

But I think we should consider: what if the word has E at position3? Then in ""FRIES"", E is at position4? So we get '-' for E? Meaning E is misplaced? But we know it must be at position3? So we don't lose much? 

Similarly, if E is at position4, we get ✓? 

So it's efficient? 

Yes? 

Therefore, I'll go with that.After analyzing the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(-)  
  - R is in the word and correctly placed at position 2.  
  - E is in the word but not at position 5.  
  - C, A, and N are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: ERUPT** → Feedback: E(-), R(✓), U(x), P(x), T(x)  
  - E is in the word but not at position 1 (since it was marked as misplaced at position 1).  
  - R is still correctly placed at position 2.  
  - U, P, and T are not in the word.  

### Key Insights:
1. **R is fixed at position 2**: The secret word has the structure `_ R _ _ _`.
2. **E is in the word but not at positions 1 or 5**: From the feedback, E must be at position 3 or 4.
3. **Eliminated letters**: C, A, N, U, P, T are not in the word. Avoid using these.
4. **New letters to test**: Focus on common untested letters like S, D, I, O, L, M, B, G, H, etc.
5. **Strategy for next guess**: 
   - Test E at position 4 to determine if it belongs there (if not, E must be at position 3).
   - Include other high-frequency letters to maximize information gain (e.g., S, I, F).
   - Avoid eliminated letters and positions where E is confirmed absent.

The word **""FRIES""** fits well:
- Position 2: R (correct placement).
- Position 4: E (tests if E is at position 4; if not, E must be at position 3).
- Tests new common letters: F (position 1), I (position 3), and S (position 5).
- Avoids eliminated letters (C, A, N, U, P, T).

This guess will clarify E's position and provide feedback on F, I, and S, narrowing down possibilities significantly.

But in the word, we have E at positions 3 and 5. Position 5 is the same as last time? The feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5? Actually, our guess had E at position 5 and it was marked as \'-\' meaning E is in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at position 5 again, it would again be wrong position? We know that, but it also tells us nothing new? We want to test E at other positions.\n\nBut we shouldn\'t repeat the same mistake? Actually, if we put E at position 5 again, we know it will be wrong position, so we avoid that? We can test E in other positions instead.\n\nSo for the next guess, let\'s place E in a different position, such as position 4 or 1.\n\nAlso, we must avoid C, A, N.\n\nI\'ll brainstorm words that fit:\n- One word: ""PRIME"" - P, R, I, M, E. But structure: position1: P, position2: R, position3: I, position4: M, position5: E? But wait, the feedback from first guess said E is not at position 5? So if we put E at position5, we know it will be \'-\' again? And we don\'t learn the actual position? So better not to have E at position5.\n\nInstead, we can put E at position 1: like ""ERASE"" - E, R, A, S, E. But A is eliminated? So we cannot use A.\n\nAlternatively, ""E"" at position 3: e.g., ""TREES"" - has repeated E? and second letter R, but the word has two E\'s? Not good because we want unique letters? Actually, repeated letters are allowed in words, but for testing, it might complicate the feedback? So if possible, avoid repeated letters.\n\nAnother word: ""PRICE"" - but C is eliminated? No, we cannot use C.\n\nSo eliminate C, A, N.\n\nConsider words starting with:\n- Position 1: allow letters that are common and not eliminated. Possible: B, D, E, ... etc.\n- Position 2: R\n- Position 3: a new vowel? We haven\'t tried I, O, U? Or consonants?\n- Position 4: E? Let\'s try E at position 4 to see if that\'s the spot? Or skip E and just include it elsewhere?\n\nActually, we must include E because we know it\'s in the word. So we have to include E.\n\nIdea: put E at position 1. Then we test if E is the first letter? Then the word would be E R ? ? ?\n\nBut position5: we must avoid something that was eliminated? And not the same as others.\n\nPossible guesses: \n- ""ERRED"": has R at position2 and E at position1? But ERRED: E, R, R, E, D - repeated R? And no new letters? Not ideal.\n\nAnother: ""BERTH"": B, E, R, T, H - but then E is at position1? And R at position2? That\'s the structure we need? The word: B (1), E (2)? Wait no, the positions: \n- Position1: B\n- Position2: R\n- Position3: E  --- here we put E at position3. That\'s new? Then position4: T, position5: H.\n\nSo the word is B, R, E, T, H -> ""BRETH""? Is that a word? Actually, it\'s ""BERTH"", but spelled B-E-R-T-H? No, ""BERTH"" is B,E,R,T,H? Then positions: \n- Letter1: B\n- Letter2: E? Oh, wait, if we have ""BERTH"", it is:\n- Position1: B\n- Position2: E (not R) -> but we need R at position2. So we cannot use ""BERTH"" because the second letter is E, not R.\n\nWe need the word to have R in the second position. So we must have R at index 1 (if we count from 0, but in position 2: second slot).\n\nSo words like: X, R, Y, Z, W\n\nLet me think of common words that start with R at second position. For example:\n- PRICE (but C eliminated)\n- TREND: T, R, E, N, D -> but N is eliminated? N is not allowed.\n\nAnother: ""CRUST"" -> but C eliminated.\n\n""ARISE"" but A eliminated? A is not allowed.\n\nSo we avoid A, C, N.\n\nLook for words: _ R _ _ _\n\nWith E somewhere? And no A, C, N.\n\nPossible words:\n- DRESS: D, R, E, S, S -> repeated S? And S at position4 and 5? But we might test S.\n- Alternatively: ""DRESS"" is okay? But repeated letters? Not ideal for testing.\n\n""BREVE"": B, R, E, V, E -> repeated E? And E at end? But we know E not at end? So we want to avoid E at end? But if we put E at position3 and position5? Then we have two E\'s? But the secret word has E? We don\'t know how many E\'s? It might have multiple E\'s? Or only one? We don\'t know.\n\nActually, we don\'t know the multiplicity. To simplify, let\'s avoid repeated letters if possible.\n\nTry ""PRUDE"": P, R, U, D, E -> U and D are new? And E at end? Again, E at position5 we already know is wrong? But we don\'t know if putting E at position4? Wait, in PRUDE: positions: \n1: P\n2: R\n3: U\n4: D\n5: E\n\nBut putting E at position5 we know is wrong? So if we get feedback E: \'-\' again, that doesn\'t give new info? So better to put E at positions 1, 3, or 4.\n\nSo let\'s choose a word with E at position1: E R ? ? ?\n\nBut first letter E: and second R? Then the word would be E R ... ? \n\nWord: ""ERASE"" -> E, R, A, S, E -> but A eliminated? And E repeated? Not good.\n\n""ERROR"": E, R, R, O, R -> repeated R? Not good.\n\n""ERUPT"": E, R, U, P, T -> U and P and T are new? And no repeated letters? Also, avoids C,A,N.\n\nIs ""ERUPT"" a valid word? Yes, meaning: to erupt volcano? So I think so.\n\nAlternatively, ""ERECT"": E, R, E, C, T -> repeated E and C eliminated.\n\nTherefore, ""ERUPT"" seems good: \n- Position1: E -> we test if it\'s the first letter? Feedback: if it is ✓, then E is at position1? Or if \' - \' then E is elsewhere? Either way we get info.\n- Position2: R -> we already know R is at position2? So it should be ✓? But wait, let\'s see: the feedback might tell us it\'s correct? Actually, we know R is in the word and at position2? So when we put R at position2, it will be ✓ because it\'s correct? But that\'s redundant? We are using one of our guesses? Although it confirms? Actually, we won\'t get new info for R? But that\'s okay? Because we are forced to put R at position2? \n\nAlternatively, we can skip putting E at position1 and put it elsewhere? Let me see if we can test E at position3 or 4 without violating.\n\nAnother word: ""TRIBE"": T, R, I, B, E -> then E at position5? We know that E is not at position5? So we get \'-\' again? But that\'s not helpful? And we could have tested E at another position? So better to avoid E at position5.\n\nPut E at position4: e.g., ""PRONE"": P, R, O, N, E -> but N eliminated? Skip.\n\n""TRICE"": T, R, I, C, E -> C eliminated.\n\n""BRUTE"": B, R, U, T, E -> E at position5? Again, same problem? But if we do this, we might get E at position5 marked as \'-\' which we already know? So why not? Actually, we test U and T? But we don\'t test E in a new position? \n\nBut we can get feedback for U and T? So that\'s valuable? The E at position5 will just get \'-\', which we know? So it doesn\'t harm? But we might miss testing E in other positions? We have limited guesses.\n\nAnother idea: put E at position3. For example, ""WRECK"": but W and K? And C? C eliminated. Skip.\n\n""CREPT"": C eliminated? Skip.\n\n""GREVE"": not a common word? \n\n""CRUDE"": C eliminated? Skip.\n\n""FRIES"": F, R, I, E, S -> here we put E at position4? So the word: F, R, I, E, S? Structure: \n- Position1: F\n- Position2: R (correct)\n- Position3: I\n- Position4: E (so we test E at position4? This is new? And position5: S.\n\nAlso, F, I, S are new letters? So we test three new letters? And E at a new position? \n\nAnother candidate: ""PRIME"": P, R, I, M, E -> but E at position5? We avoid E at position5? \n\nBut ""PRIME"" would have E at position5? We could use ""PRIDE"": but D? And E at end? \n\nWait, let\'s stick to ""FRIES"": \n- F (new)\n- R (known)\n- I (new)\n- E (in word but position? putting at position4, which is new?)\n- S (new)\n\nSo we get feedback on F, I, E, S? And E at position4? \n\nAlternatively, ""TRIED"": T, R, I, E, D -> E at position4? Yes? And D new.\n\n""TRIED"" seems valid? \n\nBut E is at position4? So we can see if E is at position4? \n\nGiven the options, I think ""TRIED"" or ""GRIME"" might work? But ""GRIME"": G, R, I, M, E -> E at end? \n\nI prefer ""TRIED"": T, R, I, E, D -> \n- T\n- R (correct)\n- I\n- E (at position4)\n- D\n\nBut we don\'t test S? But we can test S later? \n\nGiven our goal, I think ""ERUPT"" is fine? But let me check:\n\n""ERUPT"": \n- Position1: E\n- Position2: R (will be ✓)\n- Position3: U\n- Position4: P\n- Position5: T\n\nIf E is at position1, then feedback gives ✓ for E? Else if E is not at position1, then \'-\' because E is in the word? Or if not at position1, but in another position? \n\nThis way we test E in position1? Which is one candidate position? \n\nAlternatively, if the secret word has E at position3? Then we don\'t test position3? \n\nBut with ""ERUPT"", we test E at position1? And positions 3,4,5 with U,P,T? \n\nFor strategic reasons, using a word that tests E at another position? We know E is not at position5? And we tested CRANE? So E at position1? That\'s one candidate? \n\nBut E could be at position3? Or position4? \n\nGiven that we want to test E at a position we haven\'t tried? Position1? We haven\'t tried? \n\nAlso, ""ERUPT"" only has 5 distinct letters? So that\'s good? \n\nMoreover, it avoids eliminated letters? \n\nHence, I choose ""ERUPT""? \n\nAlternative: ""FRAME"": but A eliminated? \n\n""CRANE"" eliminated? \n\n""FRECK"": C eliminated? \n\nWe must avoid A, C, N. \n\nSo ""ERUPT"" is acceptable? \n\nBut let me think of other words: \n\n- ""TRIPE"": T, R, I, P, E -> but E at end? \n\n""TRIPE"": E at position5? We know it will be \'-\' again? So not informative?\n\nBetter to put E in a new position?\n\nPut E in position4: ""WORSE""? W, O, R, S, E -> but second letter O? We need R at second position? \n\nOnly words with R as second letter: \n\nSo ""TERSE"": T, E, R, S, E -> repeated E? and R at third position? Not second.\n\nWords with R as second letter: \n- PRIZE: P, R, I, Z, E -> E at end? \n- BRINE: B, R, I, N, E -> N eliminated? Skip.\n\nSo after considering, I think ""ERUPT"" is a good choice? Or perhaps ""TRIBE"": but E at end? \n\nAnother word: ""PRESET"": too long? We need 5-letter word.\n\nFinally, let me pick ""BRIDE"": B, R, I, D, E -> E at end? Same issue? \n\n""GRIME"": G, R, I, M, E -> E at end? \n\nWhich brings me back? \n\nPerhaps accept E at the end? We know E will be \'-\'? But what if the word has E elsewhere? We get info? Actually, if we get E at position5 as - again? That doesn\'t tell us anything new? But we test the new letters.\n\nTherefore, let me pick a word that tests new letters and doesn\'t care about E at end? Because we know E is in the word? And we can deduce from the feedback? \n\nSo ""PRIME"" is: P, R, I, M, E? \n\nBut M and P and I? \n\nOr ""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E -> E at end.\n\nSimilarly, ""TRUCE"": C eliminated? \n\nThen I\'ll choose ""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E. \n\nBut let me do ""PRICE"" doesn\'t work? \n\nAvoid C? \n\nBetter: ""BRUME"": not common? \n\nPerhaps ""WRITE"": W, R, I, T, E -> yes? With E at end? \n\nBut W, I, T are new? \n\nSo ""WRITE"": \n- Position1: W\n- Position2: R (will be ✓)\n- Position3: I\n- Position4: T\n- Position5: E (we know \'-\' will appear for E? But that\'s okay? then the feedback for I and T? And W? \n\nAlternatively, we have a word that tests E in a different position? \n\nBut from the available choices, ""ERUPT"" tests E in position1? Which is good? \n\nLet me decide: \n\nStrategy 1: If we put E in position1? Then feedback: \n - If E in position1: ✓\n - If not: \'-\'? But since E is in the word? It will be \'-\', meaning E is elsewhere? \n\nThat\'s better? Because we know one more position? \n\nWith ""ERUPT"": \n- If E is at position1? We get ✓\n- If not? Then E is not at position1? So it must be at position 3 or 4? Because we already know it\'s not at position5? \n\nThat reduces possibilities? \n\nAlso, we test U, P, T? Which are common letters? \n\nSo I think ""ERUPT"" is a good guess? \n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""ERUPT"". \n\nIf we get ✗ for E? But that cannot happen? Because we already know E is in the word? So E will either be ✓ or \'-\'. \n\nYes? \n\nSo guess: ""ERUPT""Based on the previous feedback for ""CRANE"": \n- R is in the correct position (position 2). \n- E is in the word but not in position 5. \n- C, A, and N are not in the word.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- I need a word with R in position 2 and E included (but not in position 5). \n- It should avoid C, A, and N to narrow down possibilities. \n- Testing E in position 1 could provide new information: if E is correct there, great; if marked as misplaced, it must be in positions 3 or 4. \n- Words like ""ERUPT"" fit well: it has E in position 1, R in position 2, and tests new letters (U, P, T). This maximizes information gain without repeating eliminated letters.\n\nThe guessed word is **""ERUPT""**.\n\n<guess>ERUPT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: ERUPT -> FEEDBACK: E(-) R(✓) U(x) P(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the following feedback from two guesses:\n\n1.

Therefore, E must be at position 3 or 4.\n- Eliminated letters: C, A, N, U, P, T (since they got \'x\' in both guesses).

(could be E, or another letter? but E must be at 3 or 4)\nPosition 5: ? (cannot be E, and not C, A, N, U, P, T)\n\nSince E must be at position 3 or 4, we can consider two cases. However, for the next guess, we want to test which of these positions E is in and also test other common letters.\n\nWe also need to avoid the eliminated letters: C, A, N, U, P, T.\n\nPossible strategy:\n- Since E is at position 3 or 4, we can try to put E at position 3 in the next guess to see if it\'s correct. If it is, then we know E is at 3; if not, then E must be at 4.\n- Alternatively, we can put E at position 4 to test that.\n- But we also want to test other letters to maximize information.\n\nGiven that we have only 4 guesses left, we should aim to cover as many new letters as possible.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have:\n- Position 2: R\n- Position 3: E (to test if E is at 3) OR position 4: E (to test if E is at 4)\n- And use other common letters that we haven\'t tested.\n\nWe haven\'t tested: S, D, L, O, I, M, B, G, H, Y, etc.\n\nOption 1: Test E at position 3.\nWord pattern: _ R E _ _\n\nWe need to fill position 1, 4, and 5 with new letters (avoiding C,A,N,U,P,T).\n\nPossible words:\n- ""BREED"" -> but repeated E? and D at the end?

Skip.\n\n""BREME"" -> not common.\n\n""DRESS"" has E at position 3? D, R, E, S, S -> repeated S? and S at two positions? But we can use it? However, we are testing E at position 3? And D and S? But S is common.\n\nBut ""DRESS"": \n- Position1: D\n- Position2: R\n- Position3: E\n- Position4: S\n- Position5: S\n\nRepeated S? Not ideal for testing? \n\nAnother word: ""BREWS"": B, R, E, W, S -> E at position3? Then W and S? And avoids eliminated letters? \n\n""BREWS"" is a word? Brews? Yes, meaning makes beer? \n\nSo ""BREWS"": \n- B (new)\n- R (known)\n- E (at position3, testing if E is at 3)\n- W (new)\n- S (new)\n\nIf E is at position3, we get ✓ for E? If not, then we get \'-\' meaning E is at position4? And we also get feedback on B, W, S.\n\nBut if E is not at position3, then it must be at position4? Because we know E is at 3 or 4? So if we get \'-\' for E in position3, then E is at position4? \n\nSimilarly, if we get ✓ for E at position3, then we know E is at 3? \n\nSo this guess will tell us exactly where E is? \n\nMoreover, we test B, W, S? \n\nBut we have position4 and 5 to fill? \n\nAlternatively, we can test E at position4? \n\nOption 2: Test E at position4.\nWord pattern: _ R _ E _\n\nPossible words: \n- ""DRIES"": D, R, I, E, S -> I and S? \n- ""TRIES"": T eliminated?

If not, then E must be at position3? \n\nSo both options are symmetric? \n\nBut we also need to consider the frequency of letters? \n\nS is a very common letter? So testing S is good? \n\nSimilarly, B, F, I, W are common? \n\nI think both ""BREWS"" and ""FRIES"" are good? \n\nBut in ""BREWS"", we test E at position3? And in ""FRIES"", at position4? \n\nSince we don\'t know which one, we can choose either? \n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that tests both possibilities? But that\'s not possible? Because E can only be at one position? \n\nWe have to choose one? \n\nBut note: we have to avoid eliminated letters? \n\nAnother word: ""ORIEL"": O, R, I, E, L -> E at position4? And O, I, L? \n\nBut ""ORIEL"" is a word? Yes, meaning a type of window? \n\nBut we haven\'t tested O, I, L? \n\nBut S is more common? \n\nI think ""FRIES"" is a good choice? \n\nBut let me see the feedback from the first guess: we had E at position5? And now we are testing E at position4? \n\nBut we know E is not at position1 or 5? So positions 3 and 4 are the only possibilities? \n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""FRIES"" to test E at position4? \n\nBut we also get to test F, I, S? \n\nAlternatively, ""BRIDE"": but E at end? We know E is not at end? So we cannot put E at end? Because we know it will be misplaced? \n\nIn ""FRIES"", E is at position4? So that\'s fine? \n\nBut ""FRIES"" has E at position4? \n\nYes? \n\nSo I choose ""FRIES""? \n\nBut let me confirm: \n- Position1: F\n- Position2: R (will be ✓)\n- Position3: I\n- Position4: E (test if E is at 4)\n- Position5: S\n\nIf we get feedback:\n- If E is at position4: ✓\n- If not: then E must be at position3? \n\nAlso, we get feedback on F, I, S? \n\nBut what if the word has I or S? \n\nSo it\'s good? \n\nBut we have to avoid eliminated letters? F, I, S are not eliminated? \n\nSo ""FRIES"" is valid? \n\nBut let me think of other words? \n\n""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E -> but E at end? We know E is not at end? So we cannot use E at position5? Because we know it will be misplaced? And we don\'t learn new about E? \n\nSo we should avoid putting E at position5? \n\nTherefore, ""FRIES"" is better? \n\nAnother word: ""BRIEF"": B, R, I, E, F -> E at position4?

Skip. \n\nSo ""FRIES"" is a good choice? \n\nBut in ""FRIES"", we have I at position3? \n\nWe don\'t know if I is in the word? \n\nSo I think it\'s fine? \n\nTherefore, next guess: ""FRIES"" \n\nBut let me write it: F-R-I-E-S\n\nSo <guess>FRIES</guess> \n\nBut we have to output in the format? \n\nBut I think we should consider: what if the word has E at position3? Then in ""FRIES"", E is at position4? So we get \'-\' for E? Meaning E is misplaced? But we know it must be at position3? So we don\'t lose much? \n\nSimilarly, if E is at position4, we get ✓? \n\nSo it\'s efficient? \n\nYes? \n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with that.After analyzing the feedback from the previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(-)  \n  - R is in the word and correctly placed at position 2.  \n  - E is in the word but not at position 5.  \n  - C, A, and N are not in the word.  \n\n- **Guess 2: ERUPT** → Feedback: E(-), R(✓), U(x), P(x), T(x)  \n  - E is in the word but not at position 1 (since it was marked as misplaced at position 1).  \n  - R is still correctly placed at position 2.  \n  - U, P, and T are not in the word.  \n\n### Key Insights:\n1. **R is fixed at position 2**: The secret word has the structure `_ R _ _ _`.\n2. **E is in the word but not at positions 1 or 5**: From the feedback, E must be at position 3 or 4.\n3. **Eliminated letters**: C, A, N, U, P, T are not in the word.

- From ERUPT: U, P, T are not in the word.
- From FRIES: F, I, S are not in the word.

So eliminated: C, A, N, U, P, T, F, I, S.

Letters that have been tested and are not in the word: C, A, N, U, P, T, F, I, S.

We know the word has R at position 2 and E at position 4.

We need to find positions 1, 3, and 5.

Letters we haven't tested: many common letters remain, such as B, D, G, H, L, M, O, V, W, Y, etc.

Since we have limited guesses left (3 more), we should try a word that tests possible letters for positions 1, 3, and 5.

The word must be of the form: [letter1] R [letter3] E [letter5]

Also, we must avoid the eliminated letters.

For example, we can try a word that includes common untested letters.

List of untested common consonants and vowels: B, D, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, V, W, Y. Note that Q might be less common.

We want to maximize information, so include multiple common letters.

Possible words: 
- ""BORED"": B, O, R, E, D? But structure: B at 1, R at 3? We need R at position 2. So no. We must have R at position 2 and E at position 4.

So words like: ? R ? E ?

Examples:
- ""DREW"": but that's 4 letters? No, 5-letter words only.
- ""BREAD"": B, R, E, A, D? But A is eliminated? Skip.
- ""BREED"": B, R, E, E, D? Repeated E? But we tested E? It's okay? But eliminated? Wait, E is in the word? But repeated? Not efficient? We know E at position 4 is fixed? But position 3 could be E? But ""BREED"" has E at position 3 and 4? We don't know? But let's see: position 3: E? Then it would be E? And we test? But we might have repeated letters? 

But eliminated: A? In ""BREAD"", A is eliminated.

Better words:
- ""PROBE"": P eliminated? Skip.
- ""TRUCE"": T and C eliminated? Skip.
- ""GRUEL"": U eliminated? Skip.
- ""DROVE"": D, R, O, V, E? But structure: 
  - Position1: D
  - Position2: R
  - Position3: O? 
  - Position4: E? But E is at position 4? In this word, position 4 is V? No: DROVE: 
    - Position1: D
    - Position2: R?
    - Position3: O
    - Position4: V? No, D-R-O-V-E? So:
      - 1: D
      - 2: R (correct? but we need position 3? Wait, position 4 is V? But E is at position 5? We need E at position 4? 

We need E at position 4? So the word must have E at position 4? So pattern: [1] R [3] E [5]? So position 4 is fixed as E? Therefore, the guess must have letter at position 4 as E? 

For example, in ""DROVE"", we have:
- Position1: D
- Position2: R -> correct
- Position3: O
- Position4: V -> but we want E at position 4? But E is at position 5? 

So we need a word that has E at position 4? So pattern: _ R _ E _

Therefore, ""DROVE"" doesn't work? Because it doesn't have E at position 4? It has E at position 5? But we know E is fixed at position 4? And we cannot put E at position 5? Because it would be wrong? But to test other letters? However, we must have E at position 4? For positions, we must match as much as possible? Actually, no? But we are not required? We know E is at position 4? But the guess doesn't have to reflect that? We can have E elsewhere? But that wouldn't be efficient? 

Actually, we can put E at position 4? Because we know it's there? So we should leave it? 

Moreover, position 4 must be E? So any guess must have E at position 4? Because otherwise? No, we can guess without E at position 4? But if we put E at position 4? Then we get confirmation? 

But we already know E is at position 4? From the guess FRIES? Where we put E at position 4 and got ✓? So it must be at position 4? 

Therefore, in future guesses, we can assume position 4 is E? So we only have to guess positions 1, 3, and 5? And we must have E at position 4? 

But we must include E in the guess? Because if we don't? The word might not match? 

Also, if we are not including E? Then we might miss? Actually, we know E is at position 4? So we should put E at position 4? In every guess? Because it's confirmed? 

Similarly, R at position 2? 

So for the next guess, we should use R at position 2 and E at position 4? 

Then we guess letters for positions 1, 3, 5? With new letters? 

So the pattern is: [letter] R [letter] E [letter]

All three positions are unknown? And we must use letters that have not been eliminated? 

Eliminated letters: C, A, N, U, P, T, F, I, S.

We can use: B, D, G, H, K, L, M, O, V, W, Y, etc.

We want to test common letters? So that we cover possibilities? 

For example, include B, O, D? Or H, W, etc. 

Consider the word ""BROKE"": 
- B at position1, R at2, O at3, E at4? But we need E at position4? ""BROKE"": B,R,O,K,E? So:
  - Position1: B
  - Position2: R -> correct? 
  - Position3: O
  - Position4: K? But we want E? Position4 in ""BROKE"" is K? And position5 is E? 
Not matching? 

We need a word where position 4 is E? So pattern: ? R ? E ?

Examples of such words:
- ""RULED"" -> R starts? But position2 should be R? So position1: R? No? 

No: the word starts with some letter? Then R at second? Then a letter? Then E? Then another?

Let me list words that match the pattern: * R * E * 

- ""TRACE"": T eliminated? Skip.
- ""PRICE"": P eliminated? Skip.
- ""GRACE"": C eliminated? Skip.
- ""DROVE"": as above, position4 is V? Not E? And position5 is E? But we need position4 to be E? 

Actually, ""DREGE"" not a word.

""GREBE"": G, R, E, B, E? Repeated E? And E at position3? But we want E at position4? 

Position4: E? So the fourth letter must be E? 

For the word ""GREBE""? 
- Position1: G
- Position2: R -> good
- Position3: E
- Position4: B
- Position5: E? 

Not E at position4? 

""AROSE"": A eliminated? 

""ERASE"": E at position1? But we cannot have E? We can? But E at position1? But we know E is at position4? So we can have E elsewhere? But for this word: E,R,A,S,E? A and S eliminated? 

Better: 
- ""BORED"": but only 5 letters? B,O,R,E,D? 
  - Position1: B
  - Position2: O? Then R? Not R at position2? 

Pattern: ? R ? E ?

So we need:
- Letter1: any
- Letter2: R
- Letter3: any
- Letter4: E
- Letter5: any

So examples: 
- ""CREDO"": C eliminated? Skip.
- ""TREND"": T eliminated? Skip.
- ""BREED"": B,R,E,E,D? Position4: E? Yes: 
  - Position1: B
  - Position2: R
  - Position3: E
  - Position4: E? But E at position4? Then position5: D? 
But position3 is E? Which is possible? 

But ""BREED"": 
- B at1, R at2, E at3, E at4, D at5? 

But we know E is at position4? So position4 must be E? 

In this word, position4 is E? And position3 is E? 

We test E at position3? Which we know may be possible? Since E might be at position3 or 4? But now we know E is at position4? So we don't need to test position3? 

But we put position3 as E? Then that might be?

But in this case, we test B at1, E at3, D at5? 

But E at position3? We don't know if it is? 

Moreover, we have repeated E? 

Not efficient? 

Alternative: ""PROLE"": P eliminated? Skip.

""GRUED"": not a word? 

""WROKE"": not a word? 

""GROVE"": G,R,O,V,E? Position4: V? Not E? 

Position5: E? But we need E at position4? 

So let me find words with the pattern _ R _ E ? 

For example:
- ""BRIDE"": B,R,I,D,E? But I eliminated? From FRIES: I(x)? 

""BRINE"": B,R,I,N,E? I and N eliminated? 

""GRIME"": G,R,I,M,E? I eliminated? 

Let's check if there is a word: 

- ""DROME"": D,R,O,M,E? Then:
  - Position1: D
  - Position2: R
  - Position3: O
  - Position4: M? Not E? 
Incorrect.

""ROUSE"": R at position1? Not position2? 

After searching, words like:
- ""OGRED""? Not common? 

""BREME"": not common? 

""WRECK"": W,R,E,C,K? C eliminated? 

""PRESA""? P and A eliminated? 

Common words: 
- ""GREET"": G,R,E,E,T? Repeated E? And T eliminated? 

""FREED"": F eliminated? 

Actually, let me think: 
- The word must be _ R ? E ? 

So third letter? Then fifth letter? 

And we need to not use eliminated letters: C,A,N,U,P,T,F,I,S

Possible options for position3: any letter not eliminated? 

For example: B, D, G, H, K, L, M, O, V, W, Y

Similarly for position1 and position5? 

Some words:
- ""DRIED"": but I eliminated? 

""BORED"": B,O,R,E,D? 
  - Position1: B? 
  - Position2: O? Then R? Not R at position2? 

We need R at position2? 

So position1 must be first letter? 

Examples that work: 
- ""ARISE"": but A eliminated? 

""ERRED"": E,R,R,E,D? But E at position1? But we know E is at position4? But also position1? We don't know? 

""ERRED"": 
- Position1: E
- Position2: R
- Position3: R
- Position4: E
- Position5: D

So here, position4 is E? and position is also E? 

We include E at position4? But also have E at position1? 

But position1 might be E? Or something else? 

But we have letter3: R? 

In this case, we test B? No? 

Avoid? 

Another word: ""BROKE"": not matching pattern? 

Perhaps ""DREAR""? Not common? 

""BREAD"": but A eliminated? 

Finally, I find:
- ""GROWL"": G,R,O,W,L? No E at position4? 

We need E at position4? 

So must have E at position4? 

Acceptable words? 

From the initial: ""BREED"" is a valid word? With repeated E? 

But let's list:
""BREED"": B,R,E,E,D? But E at position3 and position4? 

Position3: E? 
Position4: E? 

We know position4 is E? So E at position4 is fixed? 

In ""BREED"", E is at position3? But we test if there is an E at position3? 

Similarly, ""BLEED"": B,L,E,E,D? L new? 

""BLEED"": 
- Position1: B
- Position2: L? But we need R at position2? 

No? 

We must have R at position2? 

Therefore, only words that have R at position2 and E at position4? 

Example: ""GREED"": G,R,E,E,D? But we have E at position3 and position4? 

Yes? 

Similarly, ""TREED"": T eliminated? 

""CREED"": C eliminated? 

""FREED"": F eliminated? 

""BREED"": B,R,E,E,D? B and D? 

So ""BREED"" is B, R, E, E, D? 

We avoid eliminated letters? B and D are not eliminated? 

We test B at position1? D at position5? And we also have E at position3? 

If E is at position3? We get feedback ✓? If not? But we know E must be at position4? So it cannot be not? Since we have E at position4? We know it's fixed? So it will be ✓? For position4? 

For position3? In ""BREED"", we have E at position3? So if the secret word also has E at position3? We get ✓? If not? We get '-' or x? But since position3 might not be E? 

Moreover, if the secret word doesn't have E at position3? Then we get x for position3? Or '-' if it appears elsewhere? But we know E is only at position4? Because we know from feedback that E is at position4? So if E is only in position4? Then if we put E at position3? It should be x? Because it's not in position3? And not elsewhere? 

But what if the word has two E's? For example, if it has E at position3 and position4? 

We don't know? It might? 

From feedback? We haven't ruled out multiple E's? 

For example, in CRANE? We had E at position5? But it was misplaced? Meaning it should have been in another position? But it didn't say if it was duplicate? 

Similarly, in ERUPT? E was at position1? Misplaced? But that position1 is not correct? If there were another E? 

In FRIES? We had E at position4? Correct? But it doesn't tell about other positions? 

For example, if there is an E at position3? It might have been covered in other guesses? 

In ERUPT? We had U? And E at position1? But if there was E at position3? we wouldn't know? 

So it's possible that there is another E? 

Therefore, we should consider that possibility? 

But currently, we know for sure that E is at position4? 

In ""BREED"": 
- We put B at1, E at3? Then R at2? E at4? D at5? 

Feedback will tell us:
- Position1: B? Could be ✓, -, or x? 
- Position2: R? Must be ✓? 
- Position3: E? Could be ✓? Or if not in the word? Then x? Or if not at position3? Then '-' if there is another E? But we know there is E at position4? So if E at position3 is not? Then E might be missing? But we know there is at least one E at position4? So position3: if no other E? Then x? If there is an E at position3? Then ✓? 

If the secret word has E also at position3? Then it might have two E's? 

Similarly, position5: D? 

Therefore, ""BREED"" tests:
- B at position1
- E at position3 (if there is another E)
- D at position5

But we also know E at position4 is fixed? 

So this is a valid guess? 

But wait, we eliminated many letters? 

Perhaps there are other words? 

For example, ""GREEN"": G,R,E,E,N? But N eliminated? 

""BRIEF"": I eliminated? 

So ""BREED"" is acceptable? 

But let me see if there is a word with no repeated E? 

For example, ""BRUTE"": but U and T eliminated? 

""PRONE"": P? Eliminated? 

Alternatively, ""DRAVE"": not a word? 

Perhaps ""WRIED"": W,R,I,E,D? I eliminated? 

""BLUER"": U eliminated? 

So with the constraints? ""BREED"" might be the best? 

For variety? Include different letters? 

Another word: ""ORIEL"" doesn't match? 

""ARMED"": A eliminated? 

So I'll go with ""BREED""? 

But we can improve? 

Consider ""MODEL"": doesn't have R? 

We must have R at position2? 

Another word: ""GRYKE"": not common? 

""GROVE"": G,R,O,V,E? But E at position5? Not at position4? 

Not satisfying the pattern? 

So rare? 

Perhaps ""ARE TE"": no? 

I think ""BREED"" is common enough? 

Or ""BREAD"" was good? But A eliminated? 

Therefore, I choose ""BREED"" as our next guess? 

Its letters: B,R,E,E,D -- position1, B? position2, R? position3, E? position4, E? but position4 we know must be E? So position4: E? position3: E? position5: D? 

We test B for position1, E for position3, and D for position5? 

That works? 

So guess: ""BREED"" 

But in the guess, we put position4 as E? So it will be ✓? We know? 

Then feedback will focus on B at1, E at3, D at5? 

Yes? 

So I think it's fine? 

But we have to avoid eliminated letters? 

B and D are new? 

So yes? 

Thus, <guess>BREED</guess>

But let me confirm we have not used eliminated letters? 

Eliminated: C,A,N,U,P,T,F,I,S? 

""BREED"" has B,R,E,E,D? So B and D? Not eliminated? 

R and E are in the word? So no issue? 

Therefore, chosen.
</think>
### Analysis of Previous Feedback
- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: 
  - C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(-)  
  → R is confirmed at position 2, and E is present but not at position 5.
- **Guess 2 (ERUPT)**: 
  - E(-), R(✓), U(x), P(x), T(x)  
  → E is present but not at position 1. U, P, T eliminated.
- **Guess 3 (FRIES)**: 
  - F(x), R(✓), I(x), E(✓), S(x)  
  → E is confirmed at position 4 (since it was guessed at position 4 and marked correct). F, I, S eliminated.

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed Letters/Locations**:
   - Position 2: R (fixed)
   - Position 4: E (fixed from FRIES feedback)
   - Word structure: `_ R _ E _`
2. **Eliminated Letters**:
   - C, A, N (from CRANE)
   - U, P, T (from ERUPT)
   - F, I, S (from FRIES)
3. **Untested Letters**:
   - High-frequency consonants: B, D, G, H, L, M, W, Y
   - Vowels: O (others like A, I, E are tested/eliminated)
4. **Strategy for Next Guess**:
   - Leverage the fixed positions (R at 2, E at 4) to narrow guesses.
   - Focus on testing new common letters for positions 1, 3, and 5.
   - Avoid eliminated letters for efficiency.
   - ""BREED"" fits well: 
     - Tests B (position 1), E (position 3), and D (position 5)—all untested letters.
     - E at position 3 may reveal if there's a duplicate E (not ruled out).
     - B and D are common consonants.
     - Avoids all eliminated letters (C, A, N, U, P, T, F, I, S).

### Reasoning Summary:
BREED maximizes information gain:
- If B at position 1 is correct/misplaced/absent, it narrows possibilities.
- If E at position 3 is correct, it confirms a duplicate E; if ""x,"" E is only at position 4.
- D at position 5 tests a new ending consonant.
- Feedback will reduce the solution space significantly with common letters.

<guess>BREED</guess>",BREED,"We have feedback from three guesses:

1. CRANE: C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(-)
2. ERUPT: E(-), R(✓), U(x), P(x), T(x)
3. FRIES: F(x), R(✓), I(x), E(✓), S(x)

What we know:
- R is in position 2 (confirmed by all guesses).
- E is now confirmed to be at position 4, because in FRIES, E is at position 4 and we got ✓.
- Therefore, the word has the structure: _ R _ E _
- From FRIES, E(✓) confirms position 4 is E.

Eliminated letters:
- From CRANE: C, A, N are not in the word.
- From ERUPT: U, P, T are not in the word.
- From FRIES: F, I, S are not in the word.

So eliminated: C, A, N, U, P, T, F, I, S.

Letters that have been tested and are not in the word: C, A, N, U, P, T, F, I, S.

We know the word has R at position 2 and E at position 4.

We need to find positions 1, 3, and 5.

Letters we haven't tested: many common letters remain, such as B, D, G, H, L, M, O, V, W, Y, etc.

Since we have limited guesses left (3 more), we should try a word that tests possible letters for positions 1, 3, and 5.

The word must be of the form: [letter1] R [letter3] E [letter5]

Also, we must avoid the eliminated letters.

For example, we can try a word that includes common untested letters.

List of untested common consonants and vowels: B, D, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, V, W, Y. Note that Q might be less common.

We want to maximize information, so include multiple common letters.

Possible words: 
- ""BORED"": B, O, R, E, D? But structure: B at 1, R at 3? We need R at position 2. So no. We must have R at position 2 and E at position 4.

So words like: ? R ? E ?

Examples:
- ""DREW"": but that's 4 letters? No, 5-letter words only.
- ""BREAD"": B, R, E, A, D? But A is eliminated? Skip.
- ""BREED"": B, R, E, E, D? Repeated E? But we tested E? It's okay? But eliminated? Wait, E is in the word? But repeated? Not efficient? We know E at position 4 is fixed? But position 3 could be E? But ""BREED"" has E at position 3 and 4? We don't know? But let's see: position 3: E? Then it would be E? And we test? But we might have repeated letters? 

But eliminated: A? In ""BREAD"", A is eliminated.

Better words:
- ""PROBE"": P eliminated? Skip.
- ""TRUCE"": T and C eliminated? Skip.
- ""GRUEL"": U eliminated? Skip.
- ""DROVE"": D, R, O, V, E? But structure: 
  - Position1: D
  - Position2: R
  - Position3: O? 
  - Position4: E? But E is at position 4? In this word, position 4 is V? No: DROVE: 
    - Position1: D
    - Position2: R?
    - Position3: O
    - Position4: V? No, D-R-O-V-E? So:
      - 1: D
      - 2: R (correct? but we need position 3? Wait, position 4 is V? But E is at position 5? We need E at position 4? 

We need E at position 4? So the word must have E at position 4? So pattern: [1] R [3] E [5]? So position 4 is fixed as E? Therefore, the guess must have letter at position 4 as E? 

For example, in ""DROVE"", we have:
- Position1: D
- Position2: R -> correct
- Position3: O
- Position4: V -> but we want E at position 4? But E is at position 5? 

So we need a word that has E at position 4? So pattern: _ R _ E _

Therefore, ""DROVE"" doesn't work? Because it doesn't have E at position 4? It has E at position 5? But we know E is fixed at position 4? And we cannot put E at position 5? Because it would be wrong? But to test other letters? However, we must have E at position 4? For positions, we must match as much as possible? Actually, no? But we are not required? We know E is at position 4? But the guess doesn't have to reflect that? We can have E elsewhere? But that wouldn't be efficient? 

Actually, we can put E at position 4? Because we know it's there? So we should leave it? 

Moreover, position 4 must be E? So any guess must have E at position 4? Because otherwise? No, we can guess without E at position 4? But if we put E at position 4? Then we get confirmation? 

But we already know E is at position 4? From the guess FRIES? Where we put E at position 4 and got ✓? So it must be at position 4? 

Therefore, in future guesses, we can assume position 4 is E? So we only have to guess positions 1, 3, and 5? And we must have E at position 4? 

But we must include E in the guess? Because if we don't? The word might not match? 

Also, if we are not including E? Then we might miss? Actually, we know E is at position 4? So we should put E at position 4? In every guess? Because it's confirmed? 

Similarly, R at position 2? 

So for the next guess, we should use R at position 2 and E at position 4? 

Then we guess letters for positions 1, 3, 5? With new letters? 

So the pattern is: [letter] R [letter] E [letter]

All three positions are unknown? And we must use letters that have not been eliminated? 

Eliminated letters: C, A, N, U, P, T, F, I, S.

We can use: B, D, G, H, K, L, M, O, V, W, Y, etc.

We want to test common letters? So that we cover possibilities? 

For example, include B, O, D? Or H, W, etc. 

Consider the word ""BROKE"": 
- B at position1, R at2, O at3, E at4? But we need E at position4? ""BROKE"": B,R,O,K,E? So:
  - Position1: B
  - Position2: R -> correct? 
  - Position3: O
  - Position4: K? But we want E? Position4 in ""BROKE"" is K? And position5 is E? 
Not matching? 

We need a word where position 4 is E? So pattern: ? R ? E ?

Examples of such words:
- ""RULED"" -> R starts? But position2 should be R? So position1: R? No? 

No: the word starts with some letter? Then R at second? Then a letter? Then E? Then another?

Let me list words that match the pattern: * R * E * 

- ""TRACE"": T eliminated? Skip.
- ""PRICE"": P eliminated? Skip.
- ""GRACE"": C eliminated? Skip.
- ""DROVE"": as above, position4 is V? Not E? And position5 is E? But we need position4 to be E? 

Actually, ""DREGE"" not a word.

""GREBE"": G, R, E, B, E? Repeated E? And E at position3? But we want E at position4? 

Position4: E? So the fourth letter must be E? 

For the word ""GREBE""? 
- Position1: G
- Position2: R -> good
- Position3: E
- Position4: B
- Position5: E? 

Not E at position4? 

""AROSE"": A eliminated? 

""ERASE"": E at position1? But we cannot have E? We can? But E at position1? But we know E is at position4? So we can have E elsewhere? But for this word: E,R,A,S,E? A and S eliminated? 

Better: 
- ""BORED"": but only 5 letters? B,O,R,E,D? 
  - Position1: B
  - Position2: O? Then R? Not R at position2? 

Pattern: ? R ? E ?

So we need:
- Letter1: any
- Letter2: R
- Letter3: any
- Letter4: E
- Letter5: any

So examples: 
- ""CREDO"": C eliminated? Skip.
- ""TREND"": T eliminated? Skip.
- ""BREED"": B,R,E,E,D? Position4: E? Yes: 
  - Position1: B
  - Position2: R
  - Position3: E
  - Position4: E? But E at position4? Then position5: D? 
But position3 is E? Which is possible? 

But ""BREED"": 
- B at1, R at2, E at3, E at4, D at5? 

But we know E is at position4? So position4 must be E? 

In this word, position4 is E? And position3 is E? 

We test E at position3? Which we know may be possible? Since E might be at position3 or 4? But now we know E is at position4? So we don't need to test position3? 

But we put position3 as E? Then that might be?

But in this case, we test B at1, E at3, D at5? 

But E at position3? We don't know if it is? 

Moreover, we have repeated E? 

Not efficient? 

Alternative: ""PROLE"": P eliminated? Skip.

""GRUED"": not a word? 

""WROKE"": not a word? 

""GROVE"": G,R,O,V,E? Position4: V? Not E? 

Position5: E? But we need E at position4? 

So let me find words with the pattern _ R _ E ? 

For example:
- ""BRIDE"": B,R,I,D,E? But I eliminated? From FRIES: I(x)? 

""BRINE"": B,R,I,N,E? I and N eliminated? 

""GRIME"": G,R,I,M,E? I eliminated? 

Let's check if there is a word: 

- ""DROME"": D,R,O,M,E? Then:
  - Position1: D
  - Position2: R
  - Position3: O
  - Position4: M? Not E? 
Incorrect.

""ROUSE"": R at position1? Not position2? 

After searching, words like:
- ""OGRED""? Not common? 

""BREME"": not common? 

""WRECK"": W,R,E,C,K? C eliminated? 

""PRESA""? P and A eliminated? 

Common words: 
- ""GREET"": G,R,E,E,T? Repeated E? And T eliminated? 

""FREED"": F eliminated? 

Actually, let me think: 
- The word must be _ R ? E ? 

So third letter? Then fifth letter? 

And we need to not use eliminated letters: C,A,N,U,P,T,F,I,S

Possible options for position3: any letter not eliminated? 

For example: B, D, G, H, K, L, M, O, V, W, Y

Similarly for position1 and position5? 

Some words:
- ""DRIED"": but I eliminated? 

""BORED"": B,O,R,E,D? 
  - Position1: B? 
  - Position2: O? Then R? Not R at position2? 

We need R at position2? 

So position1 must be first letter? 

Examples that work: 
- ""ARISE"": but A eliminated? 

""ERRED"": E,R,R,E,D? But E at position1? But we know E is at position4? But also position1? We don't know? 

""ERRED"": 
- Position1: E
- Position2: R
- Position3: R
- Position4: E
- Position5: D

So here, position4 is E? and position is also E? 

We include E at position4? But also have E at position1? 

But position1 might be E? Or something else? 

But we have letter3: R? 

In this case, we test B? No? 

Avoid? 

Another word: ""BROKE"": not matching pattern? 

Perhaps ""DREAR""? Not common? 

""BREAD"": but A eliminated? 

Finally, I find:
- ""GROWL"": G,R,O,W,L? No E at position4? 

We need E at position4? 

So must have E at position4? 

Acceptable words? 

From the initial: ""BREED"" is a valid word? With repeated E? 

But let's list:
""BREED"": B,R,E,E,D? But E at position3 and position4? 

Position3: E? 
Position4: E? 

We know position4 is E? So E at position4 is fixed? 

In ""BREED"", E is at position3? But we test if there is an E at position3? 

Similarly, ""BLEED"": B,L,E,E,D? L new? 

""BLEED"": 
- Position1: B
- Position2: L? But we need R at position2? 

No? 

We must have R at position2? 

Therefore, only words that have R at position2 and E at position4? 

Example: ""GREED"": G,R,E,E,D? But we have E at position3 and position4? 

Yes? 

Similarly, ""TREED"": T eliminated? 

""CREED"": C eliminated? 

""FREED"": F eliminated? 

""BREED"": B,R,E,E,D? B and D? 

So ""BREED"" is B, R, E, E, D? 

We avoid eliminated letters? B and D are not eliminated? 

We test B at position1? D at position5? And we also have E at position3? 

If E is at position3? We get feedback ✓? If not? But we know E must be at position4? So it cannot be not? Since we have E at position4? We know it's fixed? So it will be ✓? For position4? 

For position3? In ""BREED"", we have E at position3? So if the secret word also has E at position3? We get ✓? If not? We get '-' or x? But since position3 might not be E? 

Moreover, if the secret word doesn't have E at position3? Then we get x for position3? Or '-' if it appears elsewhere? But we know E is only at position4? Because we know from feedback that E is at position4? So if E is only in position4? Then if we put E at position3? It should be x? Because it's not in position3? And not elsewhere? 

But what if the word has two E's? For example, if it has E at position3 and position4? 

We don't know? It might? 

From feedback? We haven't ruled out multiple E's? 

For example, in CRANE? We had E at position5? But it was misplaced? Meaning it should have been in another position? But it didn't say if it was duplicate? 

Similarly, in ERUPT? E was at position1? Misplaced? But that position1 is not correct? If there were another E? 

In FRIES? We had E at position4? Correct? But it doesn't tell about other positions? 

For example, if there is an E at position3? It might have been covered in other guesses? 

In ERUPT? We had U? And E at position1? But if there was E at position3? we wouldn't know? 

So it's possible that there is another E? 

Therefore, we should consider that possibility? 

But currently, we know for sure that E is at position4? 

In ""BREED"": 
- We put B at1, E at3? Then R at2? E at4? D at5? 

Feedback will tell us:
- Position1: B? Could be ✓, -, or x? 
- Position2: R? Must be ✓? 
- Position3: E? Could be ✓? Or if not in the word? Then x? Or if not at position3? Then '-' if there is another E? But we know there is E at position4? So if E at position3 is not? Then E might be missing? But we know there is at least one E at position4? So position3: if no other E? Then x? If there is an E at position3? Then ✓? 

If the secret word has E also at position3? Then it might have two E's? 

Similarly, position5: D? 

Therefore, ""BREED"" tests:
- B at position1
- E at position3 (if there is another E)
- D at position5

But we also know E at position4 is fixed? 

So this is a valid guess? 

But wait, we eliminated many letters? 

Perhaps there are other words? 

For example, ""GREEN"": G,R,E,E,N? But N eliminated? 

""BRIEF"": I eliminated? 

So ""BREED"" is acceptable? 

But let me see if there is a word with no repeated E? 

For example, ""BRUTE"": but U and T eliminated? 

""PRONE"": P? Eliminated? 

Alternatively, ""DRAVE"": not a word? 

Perhaps ""WRIED"": W,R,I,E,D? I eliminated? 

""BLUER"": U eliminated? 

So with the constraints? ""BREED"" might be the best? 

For variety? Include different letters? 

Another word: ""ORIEL"" doesn't match? 

""ARMED"": A eliminated? 

So I'll go with ""BREED""? 

But we can improve? 

Consider ""MODEL"": doesn't have R? 

We must have R at position2? 

Another word: ""GRYKE"": not common? 

""GROVE"": G,R,O,V,E? But E at position5? Not at position4? 

Not satisfying the pattern? 

So rare? 

Perhaps ""ARE TE"": no? 

I think ""BREED"" is common enough? 

Or ""BREAD"" was good? But A eliminated? 

Therefore, I choose ""BREED"" as our next guess? 

Its letters: B,R,E,E,D -- position1, B? position2, R? position3, E? position4, E? but position4 we know must be E? So position4: E? position3: E? position5: D? 

We test B for position1, E for position3, and D for position5? 

That works? 

So guess: ""BREED"" 

But in the guess, we put position4 as E? So it will be ✓? We know? 

Then feedback will focus on B at1, E at3, D at5? 

Yes? 

So I think it's fine? 

But we have to avoid eliminated letters? 

B and D are new? 

So yes? 

Thus, <guess>BREED</guess>

But let me confirm we have not used eliminated letters? 

Eliminated: C,A,N,U,P,T,F,I,S? 

""BREED"" has B,R,E,E,D? So B and D? Not eliminated? 

R and E are in the word? So no issue? 

Therefore, chosen.### Analysis of Previous Feedback
- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: 
  - C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(-)  
  → R is confirmed at position 2, and E is present but not at position 5.
- **Guess 2 (ERUPT)**: 
  - E(-), R(✓), U(x), P(x), T(x)  
  → E is present but not at position 1. U, P, T eliminated.
- **Guess 3 (FRIES)**: 
  - F(x), R(✓), I(x), E(✓), S(x)  
  → E is confirmed at position 4 (since it was guessed at position 4 and marked correct). F, I, S eliminated.

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed Letters/Locations**:
   - Position 2: R (fixed)
   - Position 4: E (fixed from FRIES feedback)
   - Word structure: `_ R _ E _`
2. **Eliminated Letters**:
   - C, A, N (from CRANE)
   - U, P, T (from ERUPT)
   - F, I, S (from FRIES)
3. **Untested Letters**:
   - High-frequency consonants: B, D, G, H, L, M, W, Y
   - Vowels: O (others like A, I, E are tested/eliminated)
4. **Strategy for Next Guess**:
   - Leverage the fixed positions (R at 2, E at 4) to narrow guesses.
   - Focus on testing new common letters for positions 1, 3, and 5.
   - Avoid eliminated letters for efficiency.
   - ""BREED"" fits well: 
     - Tests B (position 1), E (position 3), and D (position 5)—all untested letters.
     - E at position 3 may reveal if there's a duplicate E (not ruled out).
     - B and D are common consonants.
     - Avoids all eliminated letters (C, A, N, U, P, T, F, I, S).

### Reasoning Summary:
BREED maximizes information gain:
- If B at position 1 is correct/misplaced/absent, it narrows possibilities.
- If E at position 3 is correct, it confirms a duplicate E; if ""x,"" E is only at position 4.
- D at position 5 tests a new ending consonant.
- Feedback will reduce the solution space significantly with common letters.",Guess 4: BREED -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) R(✓) E(✓) E(✓) D(✓),SUCCESS
