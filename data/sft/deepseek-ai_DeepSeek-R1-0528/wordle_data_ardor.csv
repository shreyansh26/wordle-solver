We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, from this we know:
- The second letter is R (since R is in the correct position).
- The letter A is in the word but not in the third position (where we guessed it).
- The letters C, N, E are not in the word at all.

We also know that the secret word has exactly 5 letters.

Now, we need to make a second guess that meets these conditions:
- Must be a valid 5-letter English word.
- Must have R as the second letter (because it's confirmed in position 2).
- Must include the letter A, but not in the third position.
- Must not include C, N, E.

Additionally, we want to try to cover other common letters to get more information.

Since A is in the word but not in position 3, it could be in position 1, 4, or 5.

We also want to avoid the letters that we know are absent: C, N, E.

Let's think of possible words that have R as the second letter and include A.

Possible positions for A: first, fourth, or fifth.

We should try to use other common consonants and vowels that we haven't tested yet. We haven't used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But note that we have eliminated C, N, E.

Common letters to consider: T, S, L, etc.

Let's try to form a word.

Possibilities:

- _ R _ A _ : such as TRYST? But we don't know if Y is used. Also, we need valid words.

Another option: If A is first, then A R _ _ _ : such as ARRAY? But we have two As? Our guess can have duplicate letters? Actually, the feedback doesn't rule out duplicate letters, but we don't have evidence for that. However, note that the secret word might have duplicate letters.

But in our case, we know A is present once at least (because of the '-'). We don't know if it appears more.

But let's stick to single A for now unless forced.

Example words:

- With A in position 1: ARISE, AROMA, etc.

But wait, position 1: AR... but we know the first letter isn't C (eliminated) but other letters are possible.

But note: we know A is in the word but not in position 3. So A can be in 1,4,5.

Also, we want to avoid C, N, E.

Let me list some possibilities:

1. If A is first: A R _ _ _
   - Examples: ARBOR (but O? and B), ARFAT? (invalid), ARBOR is valid? But let's think common words: ARTSY? too rare. ARSON? But S is common. However, we haven't tested S. But note, we can use words with S. Also, ARROW? Then O and W.

But wait, we need to make sure we don't use eliminated letters: C, N, E are out. So for ARSON: A, R, S, O, N? Wait, N is eliminated! So ARSON has N -> not allowed.

Similarly, ARROW: A, R, R, O, W -> no eliminated letters? Wait, E and C and N are out, but O and W are new? So ARROW: A in first, R in second and third? But we don't know if the word has two R's? It's possible.

But we also have to consider the R: we have R in position 2, so if we guess ARROW, the second letter is R (which is good) and then we have R as third letter too? But that might be acceptable.

But let's think about other positions for A.

2. A in position 4: _ R _ A _
   - Examples: WORDY? No A. TRACT? T and C? But C is eliminated. Maybe TRAIL? But L? And we have A in fourth? TRAIL: T, R, A, I, L -> but A is in third? Wait, position 4 must be A? So we need letter patterns like _ R [letter1] A [letter2]. 

Common words: DRAMA? D, R, A, M, A? But A is in third and fifth? Then the A in third would conflict? Wait, if we try DRAMA: positions: D, R, A, M, A. So if the secret word has A in third position? But our feedback said A is in the word but not in third? That means the secret word has an A, but not in the position we guessed (which was position 3). So the secret word has A somewhere else. So if we guess a word with A in third, that might be incorrect? But if the secret word has two A's, one of which is in third, then that would have been marked as ✓? But originally we had A in position 3 and it was marked as '-', meaning it is in the word but not in that position.

So we know there is at least one A not in position 3. It could be in position 4.

So for _ R _ A _ : examples: TRADE? But D and E? E is eliminated. BRASH? B, R, A, S, H -> that could work. Here, A is in fourth? No: BRASH: B, R, A, S, H -> so A is in third? But we need to avoid position 3? Wait, no: in BRASH, A is the third letter? But we know A cannot be in third? So that would be bad to guess?

Wait, in our guess we want to test A in different positions? We know A is not in third, so we shouldn't put A in third because it would be wrong? But actually, we can put A in third to rule out? No, we already know it's not in third? So we should avoid putting A in third.

Therefore, we need a word that has R in second position and has A in either position 1, 4, or 5.

So:

- Position 1: A R _ _ _ 
- Position 4: _ R _ A _
- Position 5: _ R _ _ A

Now, avoid C, N, E.

Also, we can try to include other common letters to test them.

Let's consider the position 1 case: A R _ _ _
Avoiding C, N, E. Common words: ARROW, ARSON (but ARSON has N? Wait, ARSON: A-R-S-O-N -> N is eliminated -> cannot use ARSON.

Another: ART or ARTS? But not 5 letters. ARBOR? A-R-B-O-R -> valid. Letters: A, R, B, O, R. Has R twice? But that's acceptable.

Is there a word ARDOR? Also valid.

But we don't know if B, O, etc. are in? We can use it.

Another: ARMED? but E and D? E is eliminated -> cannot use ARMED.

So ARBOR: A-R-B-O-R -> word.

Now, if position 4: _ R _ A _ 
Examples: WORDY? no A. TRAVA? not common. ORGAS? not. We can try: FRAUD? F-R-A-U-D -> A is in third? That would be bad? Because we know A is not in third. Wait, no: FRAUD is F-R-A-U-D -> third letter A? We know A is not in third position? So this word has A in third -> we would be testing A in the same wrong position? That doesn't help.

So we must have A in a position other than third.

For position 4: _ R _ A _ -> so the pattern is: first, second=R, third, fourth=A, fifth.

Example: GRASS? GRASS: G-R-A-S-S -> A is in third? No: G (1), R (2), A (3), S (4), S (5). So A is in third -> wrong.

To have A in fourth: we need a word where the fourth letter is A. So first letter, then R in second, then any letter in third (but not A?), then A in fourth, then any in fifth.

Example: ORCAS? But C and S? C is eliminated -> not. Other: URBAN? U-R-B-A-N -> has N? N is eliminated -> not. TRAGI? Not common. BRAND? B-R-A-N-D -> N eliminated -> not.

CRANE was our first guess and C and N are out.

Another possibility: BRAVA? But V and A at end? BRAVA is B-R-A-V-A -> then A is in third and fifth? We don't want A in third because we know it's not there? So if we guess BRAVA, the A in third would be marked as '-' (if the word has another A) or 'x' (if only one A)? But it's messy.

But let's try position 5: _ R _ _ A
Examples: ORTET? Not. Popular: URBANA? Not 5 letters. ARTSA? Invalid. 

Common words: OPERA? But O-P-E-R-A -> E is eliminated -> not.

Another: EXTRA? But E and X? E is eliminated -> not.

It seems difficult? But note: we can consider that the word might have two A's? Then having A in third might be acceptable? But our feedback said A is in the word but not in third? Meaning there is at least one A somewhere else? But it could be that there is another A in third? Then originally it should have been marked as '-' because it is present but in a duplicate position? Actually, the rule: if the letter is in the word, but we guess it in a position where the duplicate occurs? Wait, the rules say:

- ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the correct position.
- - : The letter is in the word but in the wrong position.
- x : The letter is not in the word.

Now, if the letter appears twice? Then each guess letter is compared independently.

For example, if secret word is BALSA and we guess CRANE: 
- C vs B? not in -> x
- R vs A? not in -> but wait? Actually, the second letter: R vs A? It's not R -> so x? And so on.

But in our case, secret word has A? and we guessed A in position 3? And it was marked as '-' (wrong position). That means the secret word has at least one A, but not in position 3.

So even if the secret word has two A's, one of which is in position 3, then our guess of A in position 3 would be marked as ✓? But it wasn't; it was marked as '-'. So that means there is no A in position 3? Therefore, we can conclude that the secret word has no A in position 3? So we can avoid putting A in position 3? That is safe.

Therefore, we must avoid A in position 3.

So back to possibilities:

Let me try to find words with R in second position and A in position 1,4, or 5, avoiding C, N, E.

Also, we haven't used many letters. We can try B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? Except C, N, E are out.

Let's consider A in position 1: AR something.

Common words: 
- ARRAY: A-R-R-A-Y -> has R twice? But valid. A in first? And two Rs? and A in fourth? We know R is in second? So if there is an R in third, that's fine? But the secret word might have duplicate? 
  - The feedback: in ARRAY, the second letter R would be ✓ (correct position). The third letter R: if the secret word has R only in second? Then the third R would be either:
    - If secret word has an R in third? then it would be ✓? But we don't know.
    - Otherwise, if only second R, then third R would be absent? -> marked x? But that's possible.

But we don't mind. We are using this to test letters.

Similarly: ARBOR: A-R-B-O-R -> same.

But let's look for words with common letters we can test.

Alternatively, forget A for a moment? But no, we have to include A because we know it is in the word? But wait, we don't have to: we are allowed to guess any word? But we know A is in the secret word? So we should include A? It's better so that we can get its position.

But note: we are allowed to not include A? But then we wouldn't get any information about where A is? So it's better to include A.

So we need A in the guess? Yes.

Another idea: use a word with A in position 4: _ R _ A _

For example: TRASH? T-R-A-S-H -> A in third? Wrong -> not allowed? So not.

But wait: TRASH has A in third -> avoid.

So how about: ORGIA? not common. 

FRACT? But C? Eliminated -> no.

Another: Using S: words like PARTS? P-A-R-T-S -> but R is third? Wait, we need R at second. So P R are the first two.

So: PR something: PR and then have A in fourth or fifth.

If A in fourth: P R ? A ? -> e.g., PRADA? P-R-A-D-A -> then A in third and fifth? We don't want third? Avoid A in third? So PRADA has A in third? -> not good.

PR and A in fifth: PR something and A at end? E.g., PRY or not? Not 5 letters.

What about: TRIAD? T-R-I-A-D -> here R is second? good? and A is fourth? That's allowed: positions: 1: T, 2: R, 3: I, 4: A, 5: D

So TRIAD: T-R-I-A-D.

Are these letters allowed? T,R,I,A,D -> no C, N, E -> all fine.

Also, we can test T, I, D? 

So I think TRIAD is a good candidate.

Now, what about other options? Such as A in fifth? e.g., ????? R at second and A at fifth? Example: U R anything and A? URA? Not. GRUFA? Not. Let's see: OPERA? Opera is O-P-E-R-A -> but E eliminated -> not. 

Another: MANOR? M-A-N-O-R -> but N eliminated and R is fifth? We need R as second? So no.

TORTA? T-O-R-T-A -> but R is third -> not.

So TRIAD seems reasonable.

Another possibility: BRASH? B-R-A-S-H -> but A is in third? Which we must avoid? So that would be bad.

Therefore, let's go with TRIAD.

So our second guess: TRIAD

Checking: TRIAD: T, R, I, A, D
- We know R must be in position 2, which it is (R).
- A is in position 4? Yes, fourth letter? In TRIAD: T (1), R (2), I (3), A (4), D (5). So A is not in third? Good? But we have A in fourth? Which is possible? Because we know A is not in third? But the secret word might have A in fourth? Or in position 1? But we haven't constrained that? Actually, we are testing A in position 4? So if it is not in position 4? Then we'll get '-' for A meaning in the word but not in 4? Or 'x'? It depends.

By putting A in position 4, we can rule out whether A is in position 4 or we know it must be in 1 or 5.

This is acceptable.

Thus, I choose TRIAD.

<guess>triad</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is not in the word.
- R is correct and in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N is not in the word.
- E is not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word has R as the second letter and includes A, but A is not in position 3 (it could be in position 1, 4, or 5). The word also excludes C, N, and E.

For the second guess, I chose ""triad"" because:
- It has R in position 2 (required).
- It includes A in position 4 (testing a new position).
- The letters T, I, D are new and common, helping test for more letters.
- It avoids C, N, and E.

This guess will provide more information about the positions of A and other letters like T, I, and D.

<guess>triad</guess>",triad,"We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, from this we know:
- The second letter is R (since R is in the correct position).
- The letter A is in the word but not in the third position (where we guessed it).

Possible positions for A: first, fourth, or fifth.

   - Examples: WORDY? No A. TRACT? T and C? But C is eliminated. Maybe TRAIL? But L? And we have A in fourth? TRAIL: T, R, A, I, L -> but A is in third? Wait, position 4 must be A? So we need letter patterns like _ R [letter1] A [letter2]. 

Common words: DRAMA? D, R, A, M, A? But A is in third and fifth? Then the A in third would conflict? Wait, if we try DRAMA: positions: D, R, A, M, A. So if the secret word has A in third position?

Wait, no: FRAUD is F-R-A-U-D -> third letter A? We know A is not in third position? So this word has A in third -> we would be testing A in the same wrong position? That doesn't help.

So we must have A in a position other than third.

For position 4: _ R _ A _ -> so the pattern is: first, second=R, third, fourth=A, fifth.

Example: GRASS? GRASS: G-R-A-S-S -> A is in third? No: G (1), R (2), A (3), S (4), S (5). So A is in third -> wrong.

To have A in fourth: we need a word where the fourth letter is A. So first letter, then R in second, then any letter in third (but not A?), then A in fourth, then any in fifth.

Example: ORCAS? But C and S? C is eliminated -> not. Other: URBAN? U-R-B-A-N -> has N? N is eliminated -> not. TRAGI? Not common. BRAND? B-R-A-N-D -> N eliminated -> not.

CRANE was our first guess and C and N are out.

Another possibility: BRAVA? But V and A at end? BRAVA is B-R-A-V-A -> then A is in third and fifth? We don't want A in third because we know it's not there? So if we guess BRAVA, the A in third would be marked as '-' (if the word has another A) or 'x' (if only one A)? But it's messy.

But let's try position 5: _ R _ _ A
Examples: ORTET? Not. Popular: URBANA? Not 5 letters. ARTSA? Invalid. 

Common words: OPERA? But O-P-E-R-A -> E is eliminated -> not.

Another: EXTRA? But E and X? E is eliminated -> not.

It seems difficult? But note: we can consider that the word might have two A's? Then having A in third might be acceptable? But our feedback said A is in the word but not in third? Meaning there is at least one A somewhere else? But it could be that there is another A in third? Then originally it should have been marked as '-' because it is present but in a duplicate position? Actually, the rule: if the letter is in the word, but we guess it in a position where the duplicate occurs? Wait, the rules say:

- ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the correct position.
- - : The letter is in the word but in the wrong position.
- x : The letter is not in the word.

Now, if the letter appears twice? Then each guess letter is compared independently.

For example, if secret word is BALSA and we guess CRANE: 
- C vs B? not in -> x
- R vs A? not in -> but wait? Actually, the second letter: R vs A? It's not R -> so x? And so on.

But in our case, secret word has A? and we guessed A in position 3? And it was marked as '-' (wrong position). That means the secret word has at least one A, but not in position 3.

So even if the secret word has two A's, one of which is in position 3, then our guess of A in position 3 would be marked as ✓? But it wasn't; it was marked as '-'. So that means there is no A in position 3? Therefore, we can conclude that the secret word has no A in position 3? So we can avoid putting A in position 3? That is safe.

Therefore, we must avoid A in position 3.

So back to possibilities:

Let me try to find words with R in second position and A in position 1,4, or 5, avoiding C, N, E.

Also, we haven't used many letters. We can try B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? Except C, N, E are out.

Let's consider A in position 1: AR something.

Common words: 
- ARRAY: A-R-R-A-Y -> has R twice? But valid. A in first? And two Rs? and A in fourth? We know R is in second? So if there is an R in third, that's fine? But the secret word might have duplicate? 
  - The feedback: in ARRAY, the second letter R would be ✓ (correct position). The third letter R: if the secret word has R only in second? Then the third R would be either:
    - If secret word has an R in third? then it would be ✓? But we don't know.
    - Otherwise, if only second R, then third R would be absent? -> marked x? But that's possible.

But we don't mind. We are using this to test letters.

Similarly: ARBOR: A-R-B-O-R -> same.

But let's look for words with common letters we can test.

Alternatively, forget A for a moment? But no, we have to include A because we know it is in the word? But wait, we don't have to: we are allowed to guess any word? But we know A is in the secret word? So we should include A? It's better so that we can get its position.

But note: we are allowed to not include A? But then we wouldn't get any information about where A is? So it's better to include A.

So we need A in the guess? Yes.

Another idea: use a word with A in position 4: _ R _ A _

For example: TRASH? T-R-A-S-H -> A in third? Wrong -> not allowed? So not.

But wait: TRASH has A in third -> avoid.

So how about: ORGIA? not common. 

FRACT? But C? Eliminated -> no.

Another: Using S: words like PARTS? P-A-R-T-S -> but R is third? Wait, we need R at second. So P R are the first two.

So: PR something: PR and then have A in fourth or fifth.

If A in fourth: P R ? A ? -> e.g., PRADA? P-R-A-D-A -> then A in third and fifth? We don't want third? Avoid A in third? So PRADA has A in third? -> not good.

PR and A in fifth: PR something and A at end? E.g., PRY or not? Not 5 letters.

What about: TRIAD? T-R-I-A-D -> here R is second? good? and A is fourth? That's allowed: positions: 1: T, 2: R, 3: I, 4: A, 5: D

So TRIAD: T-R-I-A-D.

Are these letters allowed? T,R,I,A,D -> no C, N, E -> all fine.

Also, we can test T, I, D? 

So I think TRIAD is a good candidate.

Now, what about other options? Such as A in fifth? e.g., ????? R at second and A at fifth? Example: U R anything and A? URA? Not. GRUFA? Not. Let's see: OPERA? Opera is O-P-E-R-A -> but E eliminated -> not. 

Another: MANOR? M-A-N-O-R -> but N eliminated and R is fifth? We need R as second? So no.

TORTA? T-O-R-T-A -> but R is third -> not.

So TRIAD seems reasonable.

Another possibility: BRASH? B-R-A-S-H -> but A is in third? Which we must avoid? So that would be bad.

Therefore, let's go with TRIAD.

So our second guess: TRIAD

Checking: TRIAD: T, R, I, A, D
- We know R must be in position 2, which it is (R).
- A is in position 4? Yes, fourth letter? In TRIAD: T (1), R (2), I (3), A (4), D (5). So A is not in third? Good? But we have A in fourth? Which is possible? Because we know A is not in third? But the secret word might have A in fourth? Or in position 1? But we haven't constrained that? Actually, we are testing A in position 4? So if it is not in position 4? Then we'll get '-' for A meaning in the word but not in 4? Or 'x'? It depends.

By putting A in position 4, we can rule out whether A is in position 4 or we know it must be in 1 or 5.

This is acceptable.

Thus, I choose TRIAD.

<guess>triad</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is not in the word.
- R is correct and in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N is not in the word.
- E is not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word has R as the second letter and includes A, but A is not in position 3 (it could be in position 1, 4, or 5). The word also excludes C, N, and E.

For the second guess, I chose ""triad"" because:
- It has R in position 2 (required).
- It includes A in position 4 (testing a new position).
- The letters T, I, D are new and common, helping test for more letters.
- It avoids C, N, and E.

This guess will provide more information about the positions of A and other letters like T, I, and D.",Guess 2: triad -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) I(x) A(-) D(-),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, from this we know:
- The second letter is R (since R is in the correct position).
- The letter A is in the word but not in the third position (where we guessed it).
- The letters C, N, E are not in the word at all.

We also know that the secret word has exactly 5 letters.

Now, we need to make a second guess that meets these conditions:
- Must be a valid 5-letter English word.
- Must have R as the second letter (because it's confirmed in position 2).
- Must include the letter A, but not in the third position.
- Must not include C, N, E.

Additionally, we want to try to cover other common letters to get more information.

Since A is in the word but not in position 3, it could be in position 1, 4, or 5.

We also want to avoid the letters that we know are absent: C, N, E.

Let's think of possible words that have R as the second letter and include A.

Possible positions for A: first, fourth, or fifth.

We should try to use other common consonants and vowels that we haven't tested yet. We haven't used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But note that we have eliminated C, N, E.

Common letters to consider: T, S, L, etc.

Let's try to form a word.

Possibilities:

- _ R _ A _ : such as TRYST? But we don't know if Y is used. Also, we need valid words.

Another option: If A is first, then A R _ _ _ : such as ARRAY? But we have two As? Our guess can have duplicate letters? Actually, the feedback doesn't rule out duplicate letters, but we don't have evidence for that. However, note that the secret word might have duplicate letters.

But in our case, we know A is present once at least (because of the '-'). We don't know if it appears more.

But let's stick to single A for now unless forced.

Example words:

- With A in position 1: ARISE, AROMA, etc.

But wait, position 1: AR... but we know the first letter isn't C (eliminated) but other letters are possible.

But note: we know A is in the word but not in position 3. So A can be in 1,4,5.

Also, we want to avoid C, N, E.

Let me list some possibilities:

1. If A is first: A R _ _ _
   - Examples: ARBOR (but O? and B), ARFAT? (invalid), ARBOR is valid? But let's think common words: ARTSY? too rare. ARSON? But S is common. However, we haven't tested S. But note, we can use words with S. Also, ARROW? Then O and W.

But wait, we need to make sure we don't use eliminated letters: C, N, E are out. So for ARSON: A, R, S, O, N? Wait, N is eliminated! So ARSON has N -> not allowed.

Similarly, ARROW: A, R, R, O, W -> no eliminated letters? Wait, E and C and N are out, but O and W are new? So ARROW: A in first, R in second and third? But we don't know if the word has two R's? It's possible.

But we also have to consider the R: we have R in position 2, so if we guess ARROW, the second letter is R (which is good) and then we have R as third letter too? But that might be acceptable.

But let's think about other positions for A.

2. A in position 4: _ R _ A _
   - Examples: WORDY? No A. TRACT? T and C? But C is eliminated. Maybe TRAIL? But L? And we have A in fourth? TRAIL: T, R, A, I, L -> but A is in third? Wait, position 4 must be A? So we need letter patterns like _ R [letter1] A [letter2]. 

Common words: DRAMA? D, R, A, M, A? But A is in third and fifth? Then the A in third would conflict? Wait, if we try DRAMA: positions: D, R, A, M, A. So if the secret word has A in third position? But our feedback said A is in the word but not in third? That means the secret word has an A, but not in the position we guessed (which was position 3). So the secret word has A somewhere else. So if we guess a word with A in third, that might be incorrect? But if the secret word has two A's, one of which is in third, then that would have been marked as ✓? But originally we had A in position 3 and it was marked as '-', meaning it is in the word but not in that position.

So we know there is at least one A not in position 3. It could be in position 4.

So for _ R _ A _ : examples: TRADE? But D and E? E is eliminated. BRASH? B, R, A, S, H -> that could work. Here, A is in fourth? No: BRASH: B, R, A, S, H -> so A is in third? But we need to avoid position 3? Wait, no: in BRASH, A is the third letter? But we know A cannot be in third? So that would be bad to guess?

Wait, in our guess we want to test A in different positions? We know A is not in third, so we shouldn't put A in third because it would be wrong? But actually, we can put A in third to rule out? No, we already know it's not in third? So we should avoid putting A in third.

Therefore, we need a word that has R in second position and has A in either position 1, 4, or 5.

So:

- Position 1: A R _ _ _ 
- Position 4: _ R _ A _
- Position 5: _ R _ _ A

Now, avoid C, N, E.

Also, we can try to include other common letters to test them.

Let's consider the position 1 case: A R _ _ _
Avoiding C, N, E. Common words: ARROW, ARSON (but ARSON has N? Wait, ARSON: A-R-S-O-N -> N is eliminated -> cannot use ARSON.

Another: ART or ARTS? But not 5 letters. ARBOR? A-R-B-O-R -> valid. Letters: A, R, B, O, R. Has R twice? But that's acceptable.

Is there a word ARDOR? Also valid.

But we don't know if B, O, etc. are in? We can use it.

Another: ARMED? but E and D? E is eliminated -> cannot use ARMED.

So ARBOR: A-R-B-O-R -> word.

Now, if position 4: _ R _ A _ 
Examples: WORDY? no A. TRAVA? not common. ORGAS? not. We can try: FRAUD? F-R-A-U-D -> A is in third? That would be bad? Because we know A is not in third. Wait, no: FRAUD is F-R-A-U-D -> third letter A? We know A is not in third position? So this word has A in third -> we would be testing A in the same wrong position? That doesn't help.

So we must have A in a position other than third.

For position 4: _ R _ A _ -> so the pattern is: first, second=R, third, fourth=A, fifth.

Example: GRASS? GRASS: G-R-A-S-S -> A is in third? No: G (1), R (2), A (3), S (4), S (5). So A is in third -> wrong.

To have A in fourth: we need a word where the fourth letter is A. So first letter, then R in second, then any letter in third (but not A?), then A in fourth, then any in fifth.

Example: ORCAS? But C and S? C is eliminated -> not. Other: URBAN? U-R-B-A-N -> has N? N is eliminated -> not. TRAGI? Not common. BRAND? B-R-A-N-D -> N eliminated -> not.

CRANE was our first guess and C and N are out.

Another possibility: BRAVA? But V and A at end? BRAVA is B-R-A-V-A -> then A is in third and fifth? We don't want A in third because we know it's not there? So if we guess BRAVA, the A in third would be marked as '-' (if the word has another A) or 'x' (if only one A)? But it's messy.

But let's try position 5: _ R _ _ A
Examples: ORTET? Not. Popular: URBANA? Not 5 letters. ARTSA? Invalid. 

Common words: OPERA? But O-P-E-R-A -> E is eliminated -> not.

Another: EXTRA? But E and X? E is eliminated -> not.

It seems difficult? But note: we can consider that the word might have two A's? Then having A in third might be acceptable? But our feedback said A is in the word but not in third? Meaning there is at least one A somewhere else? But it could be that there is another A in third? Then originally it should have been marked as '-' because it is present but in a duplicate position? Actually, the rule: if the letter is in the word, but we guess it in a position where the duplicate occurs? Wait, the rules say:

- ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the correct position.
- - : The letter is in the word but in the wrong position.
- x : The letter is not in the word.

Now, if the letter appears twice? Then each guess letter is compared independently.

For example, if secret word is BALSA and we guess CRANE: 
- C vs B? not in -> x
- R vs A? not in -> but wait? Actually, the second letter: R vs A? It's not R -> so x? And so on.

But in our case, secret word has A? and we guessed A in position 3? And it was marked as '-' (wrong position). That means the secret word has at least one A, but not in position 3.

So even if the secret word has two A's, one of which is in position 3, then our guess of A in position 3 would be marked as ✓? But it wasn't; it was marked as '-'. So that means there is no A in position 3? Therefore, we can conclude that the secret word has no A in position 3? So we can avoid putting A in position 3? That is safe.

Therefore, we must avoid A in position 3.

So back to possibilities:

Let me try to find words with R in second position and A in position 1,4, or 5, avoiding C, N, E.

Also, we haven't used many letters. We can try B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? Except C, N, E are out.

Let's consider A in position 1: AR something.

Common words: 
- ARRAY: A-R-R-A-Y -> has R twice? But valid. A in first? And two Rs? and A in fourth? We know R is in second? So if there is an R in third, that's fine? But the secret word might have duplicate? 
  - The feedback: in ARRAY, the second letter R would be ✓ (correct position). The third letter R: if the secret word has R only in second? Then the third R would be either:
    - If secret word has an R in third? then it would be ✓? But we don't know.
    - Otherwise, if only second R, then third R would be absent? -> marked x? But that's possible.

But we don't mind. We are using this to test letters.

Similarly: ARBOR: A-R-B-O-R -> same.

But let's look for words with common letters we can test.

Alternatively, forget A for a moment? But no, we have to include A because we know it is in the word? But wait, we don't have to: we are allowed to guess any word? But we know A is in the secret word? So we should include A? It's better so that we can get its position.

But note: we are allowed to not include A? But then we wouldn't get any information about where A is? So it's better to include A.

So we need A in the guess? Yes.

Another idea: use a word with A in position 4: _ R _ A _

For example: TRASH? T-R-A-S-H -> A in third? Wrong -> not allowed? So not.

But wait: TRASH has A in third -> avoid.

So how about: ORGIA? not common. 

FRACT? But C? Eliminated -> no.

Another: Using S: words like PARTS? P-A-R-T-S -> but R is third? Wait, we need R at second. So P R are the first two.

So: PR something: PR and then have A in fourth or fifth.

If A in fourth: P R ? A ? -> e.g., PRADA? P-R-A-D-A -> then A in third and fifth? We don't want third? Avoid A in third? So PRADA has A in third? -> not good.

PR and A in fifth: PR something and A at end? E.g., PRY or not? Not 5 letters.

What about: TRIAD? T-R-I-A-D -> here R is second? good? and A is fourth? That's allowed: positions: 1: T, 2: R, 3: I, 4: A, 5: D

So TRIAD: T-R-I-A-D.

Are these letters allowed? T,R,I,A,D -> no C, N, E -> all fine.

Also, we can test T, I, D? 

So I think TRIAD is a good candidate.

Now, what about other options? Such as A in fifth? e.g., ????? R at second and A at fifth? Example: U R anything and A? URA? Not. GRUFA? Not. Let's see: OPERA? Opera is O-P-E-R-A -> but E eliminated -> not. 

Another: MANOR? M-A-N-O-R -> but N eliminated and R is fifth? We need R as second? So no.

TORTA? T-O-R-T-A -> but R is third -> not.

So TRIAD seems reasonable.

Another possibility: BRASH? B-R-A-S-H -> but A is in third? Which we must avoid? So that would be bad.

Therefore, let's go with TRIAD.

So our second guess: TRIAD

Checking: TRIAD: T, R, I, A, D
- We know R must be in position 2, which it is (R).
- A is in position 4? Yes, fourth letter? In TRIAD: T (1), R (2), I (3), A (4), D (5). So A is not in third? Good? But we have A in fourth? Which is possible? Because we know A is not in third? But the secret word might have A in fourth? Or in position 1? But we haven't constrained that? Actually, we are testing A in position 4? So if it is not in position 4? Then we'll get '-' for A meaning in the word but not in 4? Or 'x'? It depends.

By putting A in position 4, we can rule out whether A is in position 4 or we know it must be in 1 or 5.

This is acceptable.

Thus, I choose TRIAD.

<guess>triad</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is not in the word.
- R is correct and in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N is not in the word.
- E is not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word has R as the second letter and includes A, but A is not in position 3 (it could be in position 1, 4, or 5). The word also excludes C, N, and E.

For the second guess, I chose ""triad"" because:
- It has R in position 2 (required).
- It includes A in position 4 (testing a new position).
- The letters T, I, D are new and common, helping test for more letters.
- It avoids C, N, and E.

This guess will provide more information about the positions of A and other letters like T, I, and D.

We haven\'t used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But note that we have eliminated C, N, E.\n\nCommon letters to consider: T, S, L, etc.\n\nLet\'s try to form a word.\n\nPossibilities:\n\n- _ R _ A _ : such as TRYST? But we don\'t know if Y is used. Also, we need valid words.\n\nAnother option: If A is first, then A R _ _ _ : such as ARRAY? But we have two As? Our guess can have duplicate letters? Actually, the feedback doesn\'t rule out duplicate letters, but we don\'t have evidence for that. However, note that the secret word might have duplicate letters.\n\nBut in our case, we know A is present once at least (because of the \'-\'). We don\'t know if it appears more.\n\nBut let\'s stick to single A for now unless forced.\n\nExample words:\n\n- With A in position 1: ARISE, AROMA, etc.\n\nBut wait, position 1: AR... but we know the first letter isn\'t C (eliminated) but other letters are possible.\n\nBut note: we know A is in the word but not in position 3. So A can be in 1,4,5.\n\nAlso, we want to avoid C, N, E.\n\nLet me list some possibilities:\n\n1. If A is first: A R _ _ _\n   - Examples: ARBOR (but O? and B), ARFAT? (invalid), ARBOR is valid? But let\'s think common words: ARTSY? too rare. ARSON? But S is common. However, we haven\'t tested S. But note, we can use words with S. Also, ARROW? Then O and W.\n\nBut wait, we need to make sure we don\'t use eliminated letters: C, N, E are out. So for ARSON: A, R, S, O, N? Wait, N is eliminated! So ARSON has N -> not allowed.\n\nSimilarly, ARROW: A, R, R, O, W -> no eliminated letters? Wait, E and C and N are out, but O and W are new? So ARROW: A in first, R in second and third? But we don\'t know if the word has two R\'s? It\'s possible.\n\nBut we also have to consider the R: we have R in position 2, so if we guess ARROW, the second letter is R (which is good) and then we have R as third letter too? But that might be acceptable.\n\nBut let\'s think about other positions for A.\n\n2. A in position 4: _ R _ A _\n   - Examples: WORDY? No A. TRACT? T and C? But C is eliminated. Maybe TRAIL? But L? And we have A in fourth? TRAIL: T, R, A, I, L -> but A is in third? Wait, position 4 must be A? So we need letter patterns like _ R [letter1] A [letter2]. \n\nCommon words: DRAMA? D, R, A, M, A? But A is in third and fifth? Then the A in third would conflict? Wait, if we try DRAMA: positions: D, R, A, M, A. So if the secret word has A in third position? But our feedback said A is in the word but not in third? That means the secret word has an A, but not in the position we guessed (which was position 3). So the secret word has A somewhere else. So if we guess a word with A in third, that might be incorrect? But if the secret word has two A\'s, one of which is in third, then that would have been marked as ✓? But originally we had A in position 3 and it was marked as \'-\', meaning it is in the word but not in that position.\n\nSo we know there is at least one A not in position 3. It could be in position 4.\n\nSo for _ R _ A _ : examples: TRADE? But D and E? E is eliminated. BRASH? B, R, A, S, H -> that could work. Here, A is in fourth? No: BRASH: B, R, A, S, H -> so A is in third? But we need to avoid position 3? Wait, no: in BRASH, A is the third letter? But we know A cannot be in third? So that would be bad to guess?\n\nWait, in our guess we want to test A in different positions? We know A is not in third, so we shouldn\'t put A in third because it would be wrong? But actually, we can put A in third to rule out? No, we already know it\'s not in third? So we should avoid putting A in third.\n\nTherefore, we need a word that has R in second position and has A in either position 1, 4, or 5.\n\nSo:\n\n- Position 1: A R _ _ _ \n- Position 4: _ R _ A _\n- Position 5: _ R _ _ A\n\nNow, avoid C, N, E.\n\nAlso, we can try to include other common letters to test them.\n\nLet\'s consider the position 1 case: A R _ _ _\nAvoiding C, N, E. Common words: ARROW, ARSON (but ARSON has N? Wait, ARSON: A-R-S-O-N -> N is eliminated -> cannot use ARSON.\n\nAnother: ART or ARTS? But not 5 letters. ARBOR? A-R-B-O-R -> valid. Letters: A, R, B, O, R. Has R twice? But that\'s acceptable.\n\nIs there a word ARDOR? Also valid.\n\nBut we don\'t know if B, O, etc. are in? We can use it.\n\nAnother: ARMED? but E and D? E is eliminated -> cannot use ARMED.\n\nSo ARBOR: A-R-B-O-R -> word.\n\nNow, if position 4: _ R _ A _ \nExamples: WORDY? no A. TRAVA? not common. ORGAS? not. We can try: FRAUD? F-R-A-U-D -> A is in third? That would be bad? Because we know A is not in third. Wait, no: FRAUD is F-R-A-U-D -> third letter A? We know A is not in third position? So this word has A in third -> we would be testing A in the same wrong position? That doesn\'t help.\n\nSo we must have A in a position other than third.\n\nFor position 4: _ R _ A _ -> so the pattern is: first, second=R, third, fourth=A, fifth.\n\nExample: GRASS? GRASS: G-R-A-S-S -> A is in third? No: G (1), R (2), A (3), S (4), S (5). So A is in third -> wrong.\n\nTo have A in fourth: we need a word where the fourth letter is A. So first letter, then R in second, then any letter in third (but not A?), then A in fourth, then any in fifth.\n\nExample: ORCAS? But C and S? C is eliminated -> not. Other: URBAN? U-R-B-A-N -> has N? N is eliminated -> not. TRAGI? Not common. BRAND? B-R-A-N-D -> N eliminated -> not.\n\nCRANE was our first guess and C and N are out.\n\nAnother possibility: BRAVA? But V and A at end? BRAVA is B-R-A-V-A -> then A is in third and fifth? We don\'t want A in third because we know it\'s not there? So if we guess BRAVA, the A in third would be marked as \'-\' (if the word has another A) or \'x\' (if only one A)? But it\'s messy.\n\nBut let\'s try position 5: _ R _ _ A\nExamples: ORTET? Not. Popular: URBANA? Not 5 letters. ARTSA? Invalid. \n\nCommon words: OPERA? But O-P-E-R-A -> E is eliminated -> not.\n\nAnother: EXTRA? But E and X? E is eliminated -> not.\n\nIt seems difficult? But note: we can consider that the word might have two A\'s? Then having A in third might be acceptable? But our feedback said A is in the word but not in third? Meaning there is at least one A somewhere else? But it could be that there is another A in third? Then originally it should have been marked as \'-\' because it is present but in a duplicate position? Actually, the rule: if the letter is in the word, but we guess it in a position where the duplicate occurs? Wait, the rules say:\n\n- ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the correct position.\n- - : The letter is in the word but in the wrong position.\n- x : The letter is not in the word.\n\nNow, if the letter appears twice? Then each guess letter is compared independently.\n\nFor example, if secret word is BALSA and we guess CRANE: \n- C vs B? not in -> x\n- R vs A? not in -> but wait? Actually, the second letter: R vs A? It\'s not R -> so x? And so on.\n\nBut in our case, secret word has A? and we guessed A in position 3? And it was marked as \'-\' (wrong position). That means the secret word has at least one A, but not in position 3.\n\nSo even if the secret word has two A\'s, one of which is in position 3, then our guess of A in position 3 would be marked as ✓? But it wasn\'t; it was marked as \'-\'. So that means there is no A in position 3? Therefore, we can conclude that the secret word has no A in position 3? So we can avoid putting A in position 3? That is safe.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid A in position 3.\n\nSo back to possibilities:\n\nLet me try to find words with R in second position and A in position 1,4, or 5, avoiding C, N, E.\n\nAlso, we haven\'t used many letters. We can try B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? Except C, N, E are out.\n\nLet\'s consider A in position 1: AR something.\n\nCommon words: \n- ARRAY: A-R-R-A-Y -> has R twice? But valid. A in first? And two Rs? and A in fourth? We know R is in second? So if there is an R in third, that\'s fine? But the secret word might have duplicate? \n  - The feedback: in ARRAY, the second letter R would be ✓ (correct position). The third letter R: if the secret word has R only in second? Then the third R would be either:\n    - If secret word has an R in third? then it would be ✓? But we don\'t know.\n    - Otherwise, if only second R, then third R would be absent? -> marked x? But that\'s possible.\n\nBut we don\'t mind. We are using this to test letters.\n\nSimilarly: ARBOR: A-R-B-O-R -> same.\n\nBut let\'s look for words with common letters we can test.\n\nAlternatively, forget A for a moment? But no, we have to include A because we know it is in the word? But wait, we don\'t have to: we are allowed to guess any word? But we know A is in the secret word? So we should include A? It\'s better so that we can get its position.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to not include A? But then we wouldn\'t get any information about where A is? So it\'s better to include A.\n\nSo we need A in the guess? Yes.\n\nAnother idea: use a word with A in position 4: _ R _ A _\n\nFor example: TRASH? T-R-A-S-H -> A in third? Wrong -> not allowed? So not.\n\nBut wait: TRASH has A in third -> avoid.\n\nSo how about: ORGIA? not common. \n\nFRACT? But C? Eliminated -> no.\n\nAnother: Using S: words like PARTS? P-A-R-T-S -> but R is third? Wait, we need R at second. So P R are the first two.\n\nSo: PR something: PR and then have A in fourth or fifth.\n\nIf A in fourth: P R ? A ? -> e.g., PRADA? P-R-A-D-A -> then A in third and fifth? We don\'t want third? Avoid A in third? So PRADA has A in third? -> not good.\n\nPR and A in fifth: PR something and A at end? E.g., PRY or not? Not 5 letters.\n\nWhat about: TRIAD? T-R-I-A-D -> here R is second? good? and A is fourth? That\'s allowed: positions: 1: T, 2: R, 3: I, 4: A, 5: D\n\nSo TRIAD: T-R-I-A-D.\n\nAre these letters allowed? T,R,I,A,D -> no C, N, E -> all fine.\n\nAlso, we can test T, I, D? \n\nSo I think TRIAD is a good candidate.\n\nNow, what about other options? Such as A in fifth? e.g., ????? R at second and A at fifth? Example: U R anything and A? URA? Not. GRUFA? Not. Let\'s see: OPERA? Opera is O-P-E-R-A -> but E eliminated -> not. \n\nAnother: MANOR? M-A-N-O-R -> but N eliminated and R is fifth? We need R as second? So no.\n\nTORTA? T-O-R-T-A -> but R is third -> not.\n\nSo TRIAD seems reasonable.\n\nAnother possibility: BRASH? B-R-A-S-H -> but A is in third? Which we must avoid? So that would be bad.\n\nTherefore, let\'s go with TRIAD.\n\nSo our second guess: TRIAD\n\nChecking: TRIAD: T, R, I, A, D\n- We know R must be in position 2, which it is (R).\n- A is in position 4? Yes, fourth letter? In TRIAD: T (1), R (2), I (3), A (4), D (5). So A is not in third? Good? But we have A in fourth? Which is possible? Because we know A is not in third? But the secret word might have A in fourth? Or in position 1? But we haven\'t constrained that? Actually, we are testing A in position 4? So if it is not in position 4? Then we\'ll get \'-\' for A meaning in the word but not in 4? Or \'x\'? It depends.\n\nBy putting A in position 4, we can rule out whether A is in position 4 or we know it must be in 1 or 5.\n\nThis is acceptable.\n\nThus, I choose TRIAD.\n\n<guess>triad</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C is not in the word.\n- R is correct and in position 2.\n- A is in the word but not in position 3.\n- N is not in the word.\n- E is not in the word.\n\nTherefore, the secret word has R as the second letter and includes A, but A is not in position 3 (it could be in position 1, 4, or 5). The word also excludes C, N, and E.\n\nFor the second guess, I chose ""triad"" because:\n- It has R in position 2 (required).\n- It includes A in position 4 (testing a new position).\n- The letters T, I, D are new and common, helping test for more letters.\n- It avoids C, N, and E.\n\nThis guess will provide more information about the positions of A and other letters like T, I, and D.\n\n<guess>triad</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: triad -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) I(x) A(-) D(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane""
- C: x (not in word)
- R: ✓ (correct, position 2)
- A: - (in word, wrong position; not position 3)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: x (not in word)

Second guess: ""triad""
- T: x (not in word)
- R: ✓ (correct, position 2)
- I: x (not in word)
- A: - (in word, wrong position; not position 4)
- D: - (in word, wrong position)

From this, we know:

1. The second letter is R.
2. A is in the word, but not in position 3 (from first guess) and not in position 4 (from second guess). Since the word is 5 letters, A must be in position 1 or 5.
3. D is in the word, but not in position 5 (since we guessed it there and it's wrong position).
4. Letters not in the word: C, N, E, T, I.

Also, from the first guess, we know that the word does not contain C, N, E, and now from the second guess, T and I are also not in the word.

So, the secret word has:
- Position 2: R
- Contains A (in position 1 or 5)
- Contains D (not in position 5)
- Does not contain: C, N, E, T, I

Since A must be in position 1 or 5, and D is in the word but not in position 5, if A is in position 5, then D must be in one of the other positions (1, 3, or 4). But position 1 cannot have D if A is there? Not necessarily, because if A is in 5, position 1 is open.

But let's consider the possibilities:

Case 1: A in position 1
Then the word is A R _ _ _
D is in the word, not in 5, so D must be in position 3 or 4.

Case 2: A in position 5
Then the word is _ R _ _ A
D is in the word, not in 5 (which is A), so D must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

We also need to fill the other positions with letters that are not C, N, E, T, I.

Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly duplicates, but we don't know yet).

We should choose a word that helps distinguish between these cases and tests common letters.

Since we know A is either first or last, we can try to test that directly.

But we also have D to place.

Moreover, we have three positions to fill: 1, 3, 4, 5? Not exactly, because position 2 is fixed.

The word has positions: 1, 2=R, 3, 4, 5.

We need to guess a word that has R in position 2, and includes A and D, with A in 1 or 5, and D not in 5.

Also, we want to test other common letters to narrow down.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern.

First, if A is in position 1: A R _ _ _

We need to include D in position 3 or 4.

Possible words: 
- ARDOR: A R D O R -> but D is in position 3? And we have O and R again. But R is already in position 2, and if we put R in position 5, that might be okay? But let's see the letters: A, R, D, O, R. But we have two R's? And O is new.

But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters.

Another: ARDOR might be a valid word.

But we also have to avoid T, I, etc.

Another: ARDOR: positions: A(1), R(2), D(3), O(4), R(5). So D is in position 3.

But we don't know if D is in position 3 or not? We are testing.

Similarly, if A is in position 5: _ R _ _ A

With D in 1,3, or 4.

Example: WORDY? But no A. We need A at the end. So _ R _ _ A.

Examples: U R G E A? Not, E eliminated. O R G A N? N eliminated. F R I A R? But I eliminated. D R A M A? But M and A? D R A M A: D(1), R(2), A(3), M(4), A(5). But A is in position 3? But we know A is not in position 3 from first guess? So this would be invalid? Because if we guess A in position 3, it should be wrong? But in DRAMA, A is in 3 and 5? But the secret word might have A in 5? But if we guess A in 3, and the secret word has A only in 5, then it would be marked as '-' for position 3? But we already know A is not in 3? So we must avoid putting A in 3.

Therefore, for the pattern _ R _ _ A, we cannot have A in position 3? So the third position must not be A? So D must be in 1 or 3 or 4? But 3 cannot be A? So it can be D or other.

But in the word, we have A at 5, so position 3 is not A? That's fine.

But in our guess, we should not put A in position 3? Because we know it's not there? So for the guess, we can have a word with A only in position 5? And D in another position.

Example: BROAD? B R O A D -> but A is in position 4? And we are guessing A in 4? But from second guess, we know A is not in 4? Because in ""triad"" we had A in 4 and it was marked as '-', meaning not in 4? So we must avoid putting A in 4 as well? So in the secret word, A is not in 3 or 4? Therefore, A must be in 1 or 5.

And in our guess, we should not put A in 3 or 4? So for the next guess, we should put A in 1 or 5 to test.

Similarly, for D, we know it's not in 5? So we should put D in 1, 3, or 4? But not 5.

So let's design a guess that has R in 2, A in either 1 or 5, D in one of 1,3,4 (but not where A is), and other new letters.

We can try to put A in position 1 to test that case.

So guess: A R ? ? ?

With D in 3 or 4.

And we need to fill the other positions.

For example: A R D ? ? 

But we need a word. ARDOR: A R D O R -> but O and R? And R at the end? But we have R at position 2, so if we put R at 5, it might be duplicate.

But let's see: ARDOR: A(1), R(2), D(3), O(4), R(5)

Now, the feedback for A: if the secret word has A in 1, then it would be ✓. If not, then it might be '-' or x? But we know A is in the word, so if not in 1, it must be in 5? But we are putting A in 1? So if the secret word has A in 1, it will be ✓. If not, then A must be in 5, so our A in 1 would be marked as '-'? But that would tell us A is in 5.

Similarly, D in 3: if secret word has D in 3, ✓, else '-' or x? But we know D is in the word, so not x.

Also, we test O and another R.

But we have limited guesses, so we need to be efficient.

Another word: A R M O R -> ARMOR: A(1), R(2), M(3), O(4), R(5). But no D? We need to include D because we know it's in the word? Not necessarily? We can guess without D? But we know D is in the word, so if we don't include D, we might not get information about its position? But we can still get information about other letters.

But it's better to include D to find its position.

So we should include D.

Therefore, let's try to include D.

Another word: A R D E N? But E and N eliminated -> not.

A R D O R? As above.

A R D S ? -> ARDOR is one.

What about A R D V A R K? Too long.

5 letters: ARDOR, ARDOR is 5 letters.

But let's confirm: ARDOR is a word.

Another: PARDO? But P A R D O -> R is third? Not second.

We need R second.

So ARDOR seems okay.

But we have two R's? That might be fine.

To avoid duplicate, we can try: A R G U D? Not a word.

A R D E B? Not, E eliminated.

A R D O W? Not common.

So ARDOR might be acceptable.

But let's consider the other case: if we put A in position 5.

Guess: ? R ? ? A

With D in 1,3, or 4.

And not A in 3 or 4? But we are putting A only in 5? So positions 1,3,4 can be D or other.

Example: D R ? ? A -> D R U M A? But M and A? DRUMA? Not word. D R A M A? But A in 3? Avoid.

We need a word with no A in 3 or 4? So for example: D R I V E? But E and I eliminated.

D R O P A? D R O P A -> positions: D(1), R(2), O(3), P(4), A(5). So A in 5, and D in 1? And O and P.

This seems good? But we have to avoid I and E? Yes, O and P are new.

But is DROP a word? DROPA? Not, but DROPS is 5 with S? But we need 5 letters.

DROPS: D R O P S -> but S at end? But we are putting A at end? So not.

The word must end with A? For this pattern.

So ? R ? ? A

Examples: OPERA? O P E R A -> E eliminated -> not.

UMBRA? U M B R A -> R is fourth? Not second.

We need R second.

So: _ R _ _ A

Examples: G R A M A? But A in 3? Avoid.

B R A V A? A in 3 and 5? Avoid A in 3.

F R A T A? Not.

It's hard to find common words with R second and A fifth, and no A in third or fourth.

Another: C R A T E? But C and E eliminated.

So perhaps it's easier to test A in position 1 first.

Therefore, I think ARDOR is a reasonable guess.

But in ARDOR, we have A in 1, D in 3, and R in 2 and 5.

Now, if the secret word has A in 1, then we get ✓ for A. If not, then A must be in 5, and we get '-' for A in 1? But we know A is in the word, so if not in 1, it must be in 5? So we can deduce.

Similarly for D: in position 3, if not correct, we get information.

Also, we test O.

So let's go with ARDOR.

But we have to consider the feedback for duplicate letters.

For example, if the secret word has only one R, then in ARDOR, the R in position 2 is ✓, and R in position 5 would be x if not in word, or '-' if there is another R? But we don't know.

But it's acceptable.

Another word: How about BARMY? But B A R M Y -> R is third? Not second.

We need R second.

AUDIO? But no R in second.

I think ARDOR is fine.

But let's see if there is a word with A in 1 and D in 4? For example: A R ? D ?

Like A R I D S? But I eliminated.

A R M E D? E eliminated.

A R O D ? -> ARODY? Not word.

So ARDOR might be the best.

Perhaps we can use a word that has A in 5 to test that case.

For example: FORMA? F O R M A -> R is third? Not second.

SUGAR? S U G A R -> R is fifth? Not second.

We need R second.

So: ? R ? ? A

With no A in 3 or 4.

Example: U R A E A? Not.

I found: DRAWL? But D R A W L -> A in third? Avoid.

GRAND? G R A N D -> N eliminated.

BRAND? N eliminated.

So it's difficult. 

Another: ORGIA? O R G I A -> I eliminated.

So perhaps ARDOR is a good choice.

I'll go with ARDOR.

So guess: ARDOR

But let's write it: A R D O R

Now, in terms of the feedback, we can interpret.

<guess>ardor</guess>

Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C(not in word), R(correct position), A(in word, wrong position), N(not in word), E(not in word).  
  - This reveals:  
    - R is the second letter (position 2).  
    - A is in the word but not in position 3.  
    - C, N, and E are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: ""triad""** → T(not in word), R(correct position), I(not in word), A(in word, wrong position), D(in word, wrong position).  
  - This reveals:  
    - A is not in position 4 (since it was marked as wrong position in ""triad"").  
    - D is in the word but not in position 5.  
    - T and I are not in the word.  

### Key Insights:
- **R is fixed in position 2.**  
- **A must be in position 1 or 5** (since it cannot be in 3 or 4, and the word is 5 letters).  
- **D is in the word but not in position 5** (so it must be in 1, 3, or 4).  
- **Eliminated letters**: C, N, E, T, I (not in the word).  
- **Untested common letters**: We need to test more vowels (e.g., O, U) and consonants (e.g., S, L, M, P) to gather information.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test **A in position 1** to resolve its location (if A is not in position 1, it must be in 5).  
- Include **D** in a new position (position 3 or 4) to narrow down its location.  
- Use new common letters (e.g., O, S) to maximize information.  
- Avoid eliminated letters (C, N, E, T, I).  

The word ""ardor"" fits this strategy:  
- A in position 1 (tests if A is in position 1).  
- R in position 2 (fixed).  
- D in position 3 (tests if D is in position 3).  
- O in position 4 (new vowel to test).  
- R in position 5 (tests for duplicate R; if R is only in position 2, this may be marked as absent or wrong position).  

This guess will help confirm the positions of A and D, while testing O and the possibility of duplicate R.

<guess>ardor</guess>",ardor,"We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane""
- C: x (not in word)
- R: ✓ (correct, position 2)
- A: - (in word, wrong position; not position 3)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: x (not in word)

Second guess: ""triad""
- T: x (not in word)
- R: ✓ (correct, position 2)
- I: x (not in word)
- A: - (in word, wrong position; not position 4)
- D: - (in word, wrong position)

From this, we know:

1. The second letter is R.
2. A is in the word, but not in position 3 (from first guess) and not in position 4 (from second guess). Since the word is 5 letters, A must be in position 1 or 5.
3. D is in the word, but not in position 5 (since we guessed it there and it's wrong position).
4. Letters not in the word: C, N, E, T, I.

Also, from the first guess, we know that the word does not contain C, N, E, and now from the second guess, T and I are also not in the word.

So, the secret word has:
- Position 2: R
- Contains A (in position 1 or 5)
- Contains D (not in position 5)
- Does not contain: C, N, E, T, I

Since A must be in position 1 or 5, and D is in the word but not in position 5, if A is in position 5, then D must be in one of the other positions (1, 3, or 4). But position 1 cannot have D if A is there? Not necessarily, because if A is in 5, position 1 is open.

But let's consider the possibilities:

Case 1: A in position 1
Then the word is A R _ _ _
D is in the word, not in 5, so D must be in position 3 or 4.

Case 2: A in position 5
Then the word is _ R _ _ A
D is in the word, not in 5 (which is A), so D must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

We also need to fill the other positions with letters that are not C, N, E, T, I.

Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly duplicates, but we don't know yet).

We should choose a word that helps distinguish between these cases and tests common letters.

Since we know A is either first or last, we can try to test that directly.

But we also have D to place.

Moreover, we have three positions to fill: 1, 3, 4, 5? Not exactly, because position 2 is fixed.

The word has positions: 1, 2=R, 3, 4, 5.

We need to guess a word that has R in position 2, and includes A and D, with A in 1 or 5, and D not in 5.

Also, we want to test other common letters to narrow down.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern.

First, if A is in position 1: A R _ _ _

We need to include D in position 3 or 4.

Possible words: 
- ARDOR: A R D O R -> but D is in position 3? And we have O and R again. But R is already in position 2, and if we put R in position 5, that might be okay? But let's see the letters: A, R, D, O, R. But we have two R's? And O is new.

But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters.

Another: ARDOR might be a valid word.

But we also have to avoid T, I, etc.

Another: ARDOR: positions: A(1), R(2), D(3), O(4), R(5). So D is in position 3.

But we don't know if D is in position 3 or not? We are testing.

Similarly, if A is in position 5: _ R _ _ A

With D in 1,3, or 4.

Example: WORDY? But no A. We need A at the end. So _ R _ _ A.

Examples: U R G E A? Not, E eliminated. O R G A N? N eliminated. F R I A R? But I eliminated. D R A M A? But M and A? D R A M A: D(1), R(2), A(3), M(4), A(5). But A is in position 3? But we know A is not in position 3 from first guess? So this would be invalid? Because if we guess A in position 3, it should be wrong? But in DRAMA, A is in 3 and 5? But the secret word might have A in 5? But if we guess A in 3, and the secret word has A only in 5, then it would be marked as '-' for position 3? But we already know A is not in 3? So we must avoid putting A in 3.

Therefore, for the pattern _ R _ _ A, we cannot have A in position 3? So the third position must not be A? So D must be in 1 or 3 or 4? But 3 cannot be A? So it can be D or other.

But in the word, we have A at 5, so position 3 is not A? That's fine.

But in our guess, we should not put A in position 3? Because we know it's not there? So for the guess, we can have a word with A only in position 5? And D in another position.

Example: BROAD? B R O A D -> but A is in position 4? And we are guessing A in 4? But from second guess, we know A is not in 4? Because in ""triad"" we had A in 4 and it was marked as '-', meaning not in 4? So we must avoid putting A in 4 as well? So in the secret word, A is not in 3 or 4? Therefore, A must be in 1 or 5.

And in our guess, we should not put A in 3 or 4? So for the next guess, we should put A in 1 or 5 to test.

Similarly, for D, we know it's not in 5? So we should put D in 1, 3, or 4? But not 5.

So let's design a guess that has R in 2, A in either 1 or 5, D in one of 1,3,4 (but not where A is), and other new letters.

We can try to put A in position 1 to test that case.

So guess: A R ? ? ?

With D in 3 or 4.

And we need to fill the other positions.

For example: A R D ? ? 

But we need a word. ARDOR: A R D O R -> but O and R? And R at the end? But we have R at position 2, so if we put R at 5, it might be duplicate.

But let's see: ARDOR: A(1), R(2), D(3), O(4), R(5)

Now, the feedback for A: if the secret word has A in 1, then it would be ✓. If not, then it might be '-' or x? But we know A is in the word, so if not in 1, it must be in 5? But we are putting A in 1? So if the secret word has A in 1, it will be ✓. If not, then A must be in 5, so our A in 1 would be marked as '-'? But that would tell us A is in 5.

Similarly, D in 3: if secret word has D in 3, ✓, else '-' or x? But we know D is in the word, so not x.

Also, we test O and another R.

But we have limited guesses, so we need to be efficient.

Another word: A R M O R -> ARMOR: A(1), R(2), M(3), O(4), R(5). But no D? We need to include D because we know it's in the word? Not necessarily? We can guess without D? But we know D is in the word, so if we don't include D, we might not get information about its position? But we can still get information about other letters.

But it's better to include D to find its position.

So we should include D.

Therefore, let's try to include D.

Another word: A R D E N? But E and N eliminated -> not.

A R D O R? As above.

A R D S ? -> ARDOR is one.

What about A R D V A R K? Too long.

5 letters: ARDOR, ARDOR is 5 letters.

But let's confirm: ARDOR is a word.

Another: PARDO? But P A R D O -> R is third? Not second.

We need R second.

So ARDOR seems okay.

But we have two R's? That might be fine.

To avoid duplicate, we can try: A R G U D? Not a word.

A R D E B? Not, E eliminated.

A R D O W? Not common.

So ARDOR might be acceptable.

But let's consider the other case: if we put A in position 5.

Guess: ? R ? ? A

With D in 1,3, or 4.

And not A in 3 or 4? But we are putting A only in 5? So positions 1,3,4 can be D or other.

Example: D R ? ? A -> D R U M A? But M and A? DRUMA? Not word. D R A M A? But A in 3? Avoid.

We need a word with no A in 3 or 4? So for example: D R I V E? But E and I eliminated.

D R O P A? D R O P A -> positions: D(1), R(2), O(3), P(4), A(5). So A in 5, and D in 1? And O and P.

This seems good? But we have to avoid I and E? Yes, O and P are new.

But is DROP a word? DROPA? Not, but DROPS is 5 with S? But we need 5 letters.

DROPS: D R O P S -> but S at end? But we are putting A at end? So not.

The word must end with A? For this pattern.

So ? R ? ? A

Examples: OPERA? O P E R A -> E eliminated -> not.

UMBRA? U M B R A -> R is fourth? Not second.

We need R second.

So: _ R _ _ A

Examples: G R A M A? But A in 3? Avoid.

B R A V A? A in 3 and 5? Avoid A in 3.

F R A T A? Not.

It's hard to find common words with R second and A fifth, and no A in third or fourth.

Another: C R A T E? But C and E eliminated.

So perhaps it's easier to test A in position 1 first.

Therefore, I think ARDOR is a reasonable guess.

But in ARDOR, we have A in 1, D in 3, and R in 2 and 5.

Now, if the secret word has A in 1, then we get ✓ for A. If not, then A must be in 5, and we get '-' for A in 1? But we know A is in the word, so if not in 1, it must be in 5? So we can deduce.

Similarly for D: in position 3, if not correct, we get information.

Also, we test O.

So let's go with ARDOR.

But we have to consider the feedback for duplicate letters.

For example, if the secret word has only one R, then in ARDOR, the R in position 2 is ✓, and R in position 5 would be x if not in word, or '-' if there is another R? But we don't know.

But it's acceptable.

Another word: How about BARMY? But B A R M Y -> R is third? Not second.

We need R second.

AUDIO? But no R in second.

I think ARDOR is fine.

But let's see if there is a word with A in 1 and D in 4? For example: A R ? D ?

Like A R I D S? But I eliminated.

A R M E D? E eliminated.

A R O D ? -> ARODY? Not word.

So ARDOR might be the best.

Perhaps we can use a word that has A in 5 to test that case.

For example: FORMA? F O R M A -> R is third? Not second.

SUGAR? S U G A R -> R is fifth? Not second.

We need R second.

So: ? R ? ? A

With no A in 3 or 4.

Example: U R A E A? Not.

I found: DRAWL? But D R A W L -> A in third? Avoid.

GRAND? G R A N D -> N eliminated.

BRAND? N eliminated.

So it's difficult. 

Another: ORGIA? O R G I A -> I eliminated.

So perhaps ARDOR is a good choice.

I'll go with ARDOR.

So guess: ARDOR

But let's write it: A R D O R

Now, in terms of the feedback, we can interpret.
