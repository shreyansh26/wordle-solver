We are starting the game. Since it's the first guess, we don't have any feedback. 
 We want to choose a word that can give us as much information as possible. 
 Commonly, people use words that have a lot of common letters and avoid repeating letters to maximize information.
 A good starting word might be one that has common vowels and consonants. 
 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E). 
 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" or ""TRACE"" are also popular. I'll go with ""CRANE"" for this first guess.

A good starter word should:
- Have five distinct letters
- Include frequently used vowels (like A, E) and consonants (like R, S, T)
- Avoid repeating letters

We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"": all letters are marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.

This is quite informative. We now know that the secret word does not contain any of these letters: C, R, A, N, E.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not include any of these excluded letters and uses other common letters to gather more information.

Common letters in English 5-letter words that we haven't tried yet include: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, H, G, B, etc.

We should aim for a word that has as many new common letters as possible, avoiding C, R, A, N, E.

Let me think of a word that uses common letters we haven't tried. Some good candidates might be:

- ""SLOTH"": S, L, O, T, H
- ""BUMPY"": B, U, M, P, Y
- ""LIGHT"": L, I, G, H, T

But note that we want to maximize information. Since we have no correct letters yet, we should try to cover more frequent letters.

Another popular choice is ""PIOUS"" or ""AUDIO"", but we cannot use A (excluded) and we want to avoid E (excluded). Also, ""AUDIO"" has A which is excluded.

Let me list the available letters: we cannot use C, R, A, N, E.

The most frequent remaining letters in English are: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, H, G, B, Y, F, W, K, V, etc.

I think ""SLIMY"" could be a good choice: S, L, I, M, Y. But let's see if we can get more common letters.

""TOILS"" has T, O, I, L, S — all common.

Alternatively, ""MOIST"" is a classic word for such games: M, O, I, S, T.

""MOIST"" uses five very common letters and none of the excluded ones.

So I'll go with ""MOIST"" for the second guess.

This way, we can check for the presence of M, O, I, S, T.

If any of these are in the word, we'll get feedback and can proceed accordingly.

Therefore, my second guess is ""moist"".
</think>
<thinking>
The feedback from the first guess ""crane"" shows that none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word. This means the secret word is composed entirely of other letters. 

For the next guess, I need to:
1. Avoid using any of the excluded letters (C, R, A, N, E).
2. Prioritize common English letters that haven't been tested yet to maximize new information.
3. Choose a word with high-frequency consonants (like S, T, L) and vowels (like O, I) to increase the chances of hits.

Good candidate letters include S, T, L, O, I, M, P, H, and Y. After evaluating options:
- ""MOIST"" is an ideal choice because it uses five common, untested letters (M, O, I, S, T) and fits the criteria. 
- It avoids repeats and excluded letters, ensuring efficient feedback.

This guess will help identify new letters and their positions, narrowing down possibilities significantly.

2. ""moist"" -> M(x), O(x), I(-), S(x), T(x). This means:
   - I is in the word but in the wrong position (since it's marked as -).
   - M, O, S, T are not in the word.

Therefore, we know:
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, T
- The letter I is in the word, but not in the 3rd position (since in ""moist"" it was at position 3 and got a dash, meaning it's present but misplaced).

We need to make a new guess that:
- Does not use any excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, T.
- Must include the letter I (since we know it's in the word), but not in the 3rd position.
- Uses other common letters to gather more information.

Available letters: We have used C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,S,T. So available are: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we need common letters for 5-letter words. Common ones: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, U, V, W, Y.

We know I must be in the word, so our guess must include I, but not at position 3.

Possible positions for I: 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We also want to test other common letters to get more information.

Let's think of words that:
- Include I
- Avoid excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,S,T
- Use common available letters.

Some candidate words:
- ""GUILD"": G, U, I, L, D -> but L and D are available, and U is common. However, we have to check if these are allowed. Also, I is at position 3? But we cannot put I at position 3 because in the previous guess it was at position 3 and was wrong position. So we must avoid position 3 for I.

In ""GUILD"", I is at position 3, which we must avoid. So not good.

- ""PICKY"": P, I, C, K, Y -> but C is excluded (from first guess). So invalid.

- ""LUCKY"": L, U, C, K, Y -> C is excluded.

- ""BUGGY"": B, U, G, G, Y -> has double G, which might not be ideal, but also we don't know if G is in the word. But we want distinct letters to maximize information? However, it's allowed. But I is not in it.

We must include I.

- ""BUILT"": B, U, I, L, T -> but T is excluded (from second guess: T(x)). So invalid.

- ""BUILD"": B, U, I, L, D -> T is excluded? No, T is excluded but BUILD doesn't have T. Let's check: B, U, I, L, D. None of these are excluded? Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,S,T. So T is excluded, but BUILD doesn't have T. It has B,U,I,L,D. All these are available. And I is at position 3? In BUILD, I is at position 3. But we must avoid position 3 for I because in ""moist"" I was at position 3 and it was wrong. So we should try I at a different position.

In BUILD, I is at position 3, which we want to avoid. So not good.

- ""QUICK"": Q, U, I, C, K -> C is excluded.

- ""JUMPS"": J, U, M, P, S -> M and S are excluded.

- ""WIMPY"": W, I, M, P, Y -> M is excluded.

- ""LIPID"": L, I, P, I, D -> has two I's? But we don't know if the word has two I's. Also, I is at position 2 and 4. But we can try. However, we have to avoid position 3? Actually, we can put I at other positions. But in this word, I is at 2 and 4. Also, L, P, D are available.

But we have two I's, which might not be efficient. But it's acceptable.

But let's find a word without repeating letters and with I not at position 3.

- ""PUDGY"": P, U, D, G, Y -> no I.

- ""FIGHT"": F, I, G, H, T -> T is excluded.

- ""LIGHT"": L, I, G, H, T -> T excluded.

- ""WIGHT"": W, I, G, H, T -> T excluded.

- ""DIGIT"": D, I, G, I, T -> T excluded and repeated I.

- ""BIDDY"": B, I, D, D, Y -> repeated D, and no I at position 3? I is at position 2. But repeated D.

We need to include I and avoid position 3.

Let me list words with I at position 1,2,4, or 5.

Position 1: words like ""IGLOO"" but O is excluded and double O.

""IGLOO"" has O excluded.

""ITCHY"": I, T, C, H, Y -> T and C excluded.

""INPUT"": I, N, P, U, T -> N and T excluded.

""INBOX"": I, N, B, O, X -> N and O excluded.

Position 2: ""PILOT"" -> O and T excluded.

""BILLY"": B, I, L, L, Y -> repeated L, but available. I at position 2. But we can use.

""KILLY"" -> not a word? 

""WILLY"": W, I, L, L, Y -> repeated L.

""PILLY"" -> not common.

""BIGLY"": B, I, G, L, Y -> valid word? It means in a big manner? But accepted in word games sometimes. I at position 2.

""BIGLY"" uses B,I,G,L,Y. All available.

Position 4: ""AUDIO"" -> A excluded.

""JUDGE"" -> E excluded.

""FUDGE"" -> E excluded.

""PUDGE"" -> E excluded.

""PLUMB"" -> no I.

""CLIMB"" -> C and L? C excluded.

""VALID"" -> A excluded.

""RABID"" -> R and A excluded.

""FLUID"" -> F, L, U, I, D -> I at position 4. And letters: F,L,U,I,D. All available? Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,S,T. So F,L,U,I,D are all allowed.

""FLUID"" has I at position 4, which is good.

Position 5: ""TAXI"" -> only 4 letters? 5-letter words.

""RADII"" -> R and A excluded.

""TODDI"" -> not a word.

""ALIBI"" -> A excluded.

""ILIAD"" -> I at position 1 and A excluded.

""UNZIP"" -> U, N, Z, I, P -> N excluded.

""OCCUR"" -> O and C excluded.

So possible words: 
- ""BIGLY"": B, I, G, L, Y -> I at position 2
- ""FLUID"": F, L, U, I, D -> I at position 4
- ""WILLY"": W, I, L, L, Y -> but repeated L, might not be ideal for information.

""BIGLY"" is a bit obscure. ""FLUID"" seems better.

Another word: ""GUILT"" -> G, U, I, L, T -> but T is excluded.

""BUILD"" has I at position 3, which we avoid.

""BLIMP"" -> B, L, I, M, P -> M excluded.

""GLIDE"" -> E excluded.

""FLICK"" -> C excluded.

""PLINK"" -> P, L, I, N, K -> N excluded.

""BLINK"" -> N excluded.

""CLINK"" -> C and N excluded.

""QUIPU"" -> Q, U, I, P, U -> repeated U, and Q is less common.

""JIVED"" -> J, I, V, E, D -> E excluded.

""HIVED"" -> H, I, V, E, D -> E excluded.

""WIVED"" -> not common.

""VIGIL"" -> V, I, G, I, L -> repeated I, and I at position 2 and 5? But we don't know if the word has two I's. Also, V and G are available.

But repeated I might not give as much information.

""VIGIL"" has I at position 2 and 5. We can try.

But let's go with ""FLUID"" for now: F, L, U, I, D. I at position 4.

Or ""BIGLY"": B, I, G, L, Y. I at position 2.

Another common word: ""PUDGY"" but no I.

We must include I.

""FLUID"" seems a good choice: it has F, L, U, I, D. All distinct and available. I at position 4.

So I'll go with ""FLUID"".

But we have to consider that we are testing new letters: F, L, U, D, and I (but we already know I is in the word, so we are testing its position).

We also get to see if F, L, U, D are in the word.

If we get a hit on any, it will help.

So guess: ""fluid""

<thinking>
The previous feedback indicates:
- ""crane"" had all letters (C, R, A, N, E) absent (x), so these are excluded.
- ""moist"" had M(x), O(x), I(-), S(x), T(x), meaning:
  - I is in the secret word but not in position 3.
  - M, O, S, T are excluded.

Thus, the secret word:
- Contains I (but not in position 3).
- Excludes C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, T.
- Must be composed of remaining letters (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.).

For the next guess:
- Must include I (since it's confirmed present), but not in position 3.
- Avoid all excluded letters.
- Prioritize common unused letters to maximize new information (e.g., L, U, D, F, G, H, Y).
- Choose a word with distinct letters where possible for better feedback.

After evaluating options:
- ""FLUID"" fits well: 
  - Letters: F, L, U, I, D (all distinct and not excluded).
  - I is at position 4 (avoiding position 3).
  - Tests new common letters (F, L, U, D) and confirms I's position.

This guess will help identify if F, L, U, or D are in the word and provide clues about I's correct placement.
