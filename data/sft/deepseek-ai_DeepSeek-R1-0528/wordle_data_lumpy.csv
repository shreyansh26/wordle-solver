We are making the first guess. There is no prior feedback, so we need to choose a word that can provide maximum information.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 After considering, I choose ""CRANE"" as it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all distinct.

We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"": all letters are incorrect (x). That means the secret word contains none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E.
 Therefore, we need to choose a new word that does not include any of these letters.

 Since C, R, A, N, E are excluded, we should pick a word composed of other letters.

 We want to cover more common letters to maximize information. The next set of common letters includes T, O, I, L, S, etc.

 A good second guess might be ""south"" or ""pilot"", but let's think.

 Another classic is ""split"" but it has an S and T which are common.

 Since none of the letters in ""crane"" are present, we avoid: C, R, A, N, E.

 Possible words: 
   - Using T, O, I, L, S, H, U, M, etc.

 We can try ""slimy"" but we want a word with common letters.

 Consider ""tulip"": T, U, L, I, P. None of these are in the excluded list? 
   T, U, L, I, P are not C, R, A, N, E. So okay.

 But let's check a word that uses more frequent letters. Maybe ""built"" is only 4 letters? No, we need 5.

 Words: ""moult"", ""thump"", ""sight"", ""light"", ""might"", ""spilt"", ""split"", ""whump"" (if valid).

We have two guesses and feedback:
1. ""crane"": all letters are ""x"", meaning none of C, R, A, N, E are in the word.
2. ""split"": 
   - S: x (not in word)
   - P: - (in word but wrong position)
   - L: - (in word but wrong position)
   - I: x (not in word)
   - T: x (not in word)

So, we know:
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, S, I, T.
- It does contain P and L, but neither is in the correct position from ""split"".
  Specifically, since P was in the second position and L in the third, but they are misplaced, meaning:
  - P cannot be in position 2.
  - L cannot be in position 3.

Also, from the first guess, we know the word avoids C,R,A,N,E.

Now, we need to make a new guess that:
- Avoids the excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, I, T.
- Includes P and L (since they are present in the word) but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively? Actually, we only know they are not in the positions we guessed. 
  But note: for P, it was guessed at position 2 but is not there, so P must be in another position (1,3,4,5) but not 2.
  Similarly, L is not in position 3, so L must be in 1,2,4, or 5.

But wait: the feedback for P is ""-"" meaning it is in the word but not in position 2. Similarly for L, not in position 3.

Also, since P and L are both present, the word must have P, L, and three other letters that haven't been excluded.

Excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,S,I,T. So available letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z ... but common ones.

We also note that we used I and T in split and they were excluded, so we don't use I or T.

Given that, let's form a word that includes P and L and three new letters to test.

The word must be 5 letters, valid, without any excluded letters.

Since P and L are present, we should place P in a different position from 2 and L in a different position from 3.

Try to put P in position 1, then L elsewhere? Or maybe position 4 or 5.

Also, we need three more letters. Let's pick common ones: O, U, H, M, etc.

For example, ""plumb"": 
- P at position 1, but in split we guessed P at 2 and it was misplaced. Here P at 1: that might be okay if correct? We don't know.
- But ""plumb"" has P at 1, L at 2, U at 3, M at 4, B at 5.
  - We know from split that P cannot be at 2 and L cannot be at 3. But in this word, P is at 1 (which is allowed) and L is at 2 (which is also allowed, since the constraint for L only said not at 3). So this is okay.

But does ""plumb"" avoid excluded letters? Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,S,I,T. Plumb has P,L,U,M,B. None are excluded. So valid.

Another word: ""pool"" is only 4 letters.

Or ""dumpy"": D,U,M,P,Y. P is at position 4? Then we must avoid having L? But we must include L because the feedback says L is in the word.

That's crucial: since L got a ""-"" in split, it must be in the word. So any guess must include L? Well, we don't have to, but since we know L is present, we should include it to try to find its position, or we might get negative information? Actually, we know L is in the word, so we can try to place it.

But in the next guess, if we don't put L, we might get an 'x' or '-'. But to maximize information, we should include known present letters when possible.

So our guess should include P and L, without S,I,T (excluded) and without the ones from the first guess.

Also, we have to avoid the positions where we know they were wrong: P not at position 2, L not at position 3.

So, for L, it can be at: 1,2,4,5? Actually, from split, L was at 3 and got '-', meaning it is in the word but not at 3, so it can be at 1,2,4, or 5.

Similarly, P was at 2 and got '-', so it can be at 1,3,4,5.

We have other positions: so if we put P at 1 and L at 2, that's one idea.

Another idea: put P at 4 and L at 1 or 5, etc.

Common letters left: among the available, O, U, H, M, B, D, G, F, K, W, Y, etc.

Let's try to form words:

Option 1: ""plump"" -> P,L,U,M,P. But duplicate P. Also, when we guess, we don't want duplicates unless necessary? The wordle rules allow duplicates, but in this case, we don't know if the secret has duplicate letters, but since in split we didn't get duplicate feedback? Anyway, let's avoid for now.

Option 2: ""plumb"" - as I said: P,L,U,M,B.

Option 3: words like ""dowly"" but not common; ""jumpy"" has J and is less common.

Another: ""lumpy"", which is L,U,M,P,Y. So positions: L at 1, U at 2, M at 3, P at 4, Y at 5.
- P at position 4: which is fine because P cannot be at 2? Yes.
- L at position 1: which is allowed (it can be at 1).
- Also, avoids excluded letters? L,U,M,P,Y: all not in excluded list.

But in ""lumpy"", we have L at 1 and P at 4. We also have U,Y,M.

Compare to constraints: P not at 2 (ok, it's at 4), L not at 3 (ok, it's at 1).

Another word: ""bumpy"" -> B,U,M,P,Y. Here P is at 4 and L? We don't have L, so we must include L. So ""bumpy"" doesn't have L.

So we need a word with both P and L.

Similarly, ""humpy"" no L.

So ""lumpy"" seems good: contains L and P, positions 1 and 4.

But note: in the feedback for split, P and L were both present. So if secret has P and L, lumpy is a valid guess.

Alternatively, ""gulph"" not standard; ""poufy"" no L; ""polyp"" duplicate P? Also, P at 1 and O? But O is available.

But ""polka""? No, because we don't have K? Also K is available? But ""polka"": P,O,L,K,A but A is excluded (from first guess). A was excluded, so cannot use A.

So polka has A? No: polka is P,O,L,K,A? Actually, ""polka"" is P-O-L-K-A? But A is excluded? Yes, since guess 1 had A(x). So secret word has no A? So we cannot use A.

Therefore, we cannot use A.

Similarly, R,A,N,E,S,I,T excluded.

So ""lumpy"" does not use A, so it's okay.

Is there a better word? Maybe ""oomph"" but that has O,O,M,P,H and lacks L? We must have L.

Another word: ""blimp"" -> B,L,I,M,P. But I is excluded? In guess 2, I got 'x', so secret word does not contain I. So cannot use I.

Therefore, ""blimp"" has I which is excluded. Invalid.

So we must avoid I.

""Lumpy"": L,U,M,P,Y. No I and no excluded letters.

Similarly, ""plump"" has U,M,P but P duplicated? And if we use it, it would have P at 1 and 5? But then we don't know if the secret has two P's? Since we have P present, but we don't know if it's more than one? But the feedback for split had only one P and it was '-', but it doesn't say anything about duplicates? Actually, the rules: each letter gets a symbol independently? But if there were two P's, and one was misplaced and the other in wrong or same? In this case, we guessed only one P in split? So the secret could have two P's.

But to simplify, let's avoid duplicates for now unless necessary.

So ""lumpy"" is a better choice: L,U,M,P,Y.

Another option: ""pulpy"": P,U,L,P,Y -> two P's? And L at position 3? We must check: L cannot be at position 3 because in split it was at 3 and got '-', meaning it is in the word but not at 3? Exactly: so L cannot be at 3? So ""pulpy"" has L at position 3? That would be invalid? Positions: 
P at 1? Then U at 2, L at 3, P at 4, Y at 5? So L is at 3? But we know L is not at position 3? Because in guess 2, split had L at 3? So if we put L at 3 again, we would get either '-' or '✓'? But according to feedback, it's not at 3? So we are not supposed to put L at 3? Because the secret word has L but not in position 3, so if we put L at 3, we might get an 'x'? Actually, no: if the secret has L but not at 3, then guessing L at 3 would get '-' only if there is another L? Or maybe for the duplicate? But regardless, the rule: the feedback symbol for each occurrence. In guess 2: the L at 3 was '-', meaning that particular position is wrong? But if we guess L at 3 again? The same thing should happen? It's not efficient.

So to avoid wasted guesses, we should place L at a new position: 1,2,4, or 5.

Therefore, ""pulpy"" has L at 3? So avoid.

Similarly, ""pluck"" has C and U? But C is excluded, from guess 1? C(x) meaning C is not in word? So cannot use C.

So back to ""lumpy"": 
- Position 1: L (new position: 1, which is possible)
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: M (new)
- Position 4: P (should be okay? P not at 2, now at 4)
- Position 5: Y

We are introducing U, M, Y.

Is ""lumpy"" a valid English word? Yes (meaning lumpy, something that has lumps).

We might also consider other words: ""wooly""? But W,O,O,L,Y? But it has O twice? And no P? We must include P? Because P is present.

That's essential: the feedback for split had P and L present, so they must be in the word? So we must include them? Otherwise, we wouldn't be testing their positions.

We can choose not to include them? But then we might get information: if we don't include P, and we get an 'x' for P? But that would be confusing? Better to include them to try to get the positions correct.

So we must include P and L in our next guess? Well, we don't have to but it's strategic. Since we have limited guesses (6 total), and we know two letters (P,L), we should try to position them correctly.

Therefore, I'll go with ""lumpy"".

But note: in lumpy, L is at position 1 and P at 4. From feedback, we know P cannot be at 2 and L cannot be at 3? Which is satisfied? So okay.

Other words? ""bulky"" - B,U,L,K,Y? But K,Y are not excluded? And L at 3? Oh, L at position 3? We avoid L at 3? So same issue.

Cannot put L at 3.

Therefore, ""lumpy"" seems good.

Another: ""golem"" - G,O,L,E,M? But E is excluded? Guess 1: E(x), so E cannot be used? So invalid.

""loamy"" - L,O,A,M,Y? A is excluded? Guess 1: A(x), so cannot use A? Invalid.

""hello"" - H,E,L,L,O? E excluded? And duplicate L? Moreover, E is not allowed? Invalid.

So many restrictions.

""milky"" has I and excluded? I is excluded? Invalid.

So, sticking with ""lumpy"".

Thus, third guess: ""lumpy"".

But let me just double-check: 
- Excluded letters: from guess1: C,R,A,N,E; from guess2: S,I,T? Yes, S,I,T got 'x'. So excluded: C,R,A,N,E,S,I,T.
- Lumpy: L,U,M,P,Y -> none of these are excluded? 
  L: not excluded? Excluded are C,R,A,N,E,S,I,T? Yes, L not in list.
  U: same.
  M: not excluded.
  P: not excluded? Actually, P was present? But excluded? No, P got '-' so it must be in? So we can use it? Yes.
  Y: not excluded.

Positions: 
We put L at position 1 -> in split, L was at 3 and got '-', so it can be at 1? Yes.
We put P at position 4 -> in split, P was at 2 and got '-', so it can be at 4? Yes.

We don't know if U,M,Y are present? But we are testing new letters.

So this guess should work.

Final decision: guess ""lumpy"".

Response format: <guess>lumpy</guess>
</think>
Based on previous feedback:

- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E (from Guess 1), and S, I, T (from Guess 2). These letters are **not in the word**.
- **Confirmed present letters**: P and L. They are in the word but were misplaced in Guess 2. Specifically:
  - P is **not in position 2** (misplaced).
  - L is **not in position 3** (misplaced).
- The secret word must include P and L (in positions other than 2 and 3) and three more unknown letters from the remaining alphabet.

For the next guess:
- I prioritize testing **new letters** (e.g., U, M, Y, B, D, F, G, H, K, O, W) to gather more information while avoiding the excluded letters.
- Since P and L must be present but misplaced in previous positions, I place them in **new positions**: L in position 1 (avoiding position 3) and P in position 4 (avoiding position 2).
- The chosen word ""lumpy"" (L-U-M-P-Y) satisfies all constraints:
  - Includes P and L.
  - Avoids all excluded letters (C, R, A, N, E, S, I, T).
  - Plausible positions: L not at position 3 (now at position 1), P not at position 2 (now at position 4).
  - Introduces U, M, and Y as new letters to test for presence/position.

This guess efficiently narrows possibilities while leveraging known information. If ""lumpy"" yields new feedback, we can adjust for subsequent guesses.

<guess>lumpy</guess>",lumpy,"We have two guesses and feedback:
1. ""crane"": all letters are ""x"", meaning none of C, R, A, N, E are in the word.
2. ""split"": 
   - S: x (not in word)
   - P: - (in word but wrong position)
   - L: - (in word but wrong position)
   - I: x (not in word)
   - T: x (not in word)

So, we know:
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, S, I, T.
- It does contain P and L, but neither is in the correct position from ""split"".
  Specifically, since P was in the second position and L in the third, but they are misplaced, meaning:
  - P cannot be in position 2.
  - L cannot be in position 3.

Also, from the first guess, we know the word avoids C,R,A,N,E.

Now, we need to make a new guess that:
- Avoids the excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, I, T.
- Includes P and L (since they are present in the word) but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively? Actually, we only know they are not in the positions we guessed. 
  But note: for P, it was guessed at position 2 but is not there, so P must be in another position (1,3,4,5) but not 2.
  Similarly, L is not in position 3, so L must be in 1,2,4, or 5.

But wait: the feedback for P is ""-"" meaning it is in the word but not in position 2. Similarly for L, not in position 3.

Also, since P and L are both present, the word must have P, L, and three other letters that haven't been excluded.

Excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,S,I,T. So available letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z ... but common ones.

We also note that we used I and T in split and they were excluded, so we don't use I or T.

Given that, let's form a word that includes P and L and three new letters to test.

The word must be 5 letters, valid, without any excluded letters.

Since P and L are present, we should place P in a different position from 2 and L in a different position from 3.

Try to put P in position 1, then L elsewhere? Or maybe position 4 or 5.

Also, we need three more letters. Let's pick common ones: O, U, H, M, etc.

For example, ""plumb"": 
- P at position 1, but in split we guessed P at 2 and it was misplaced. Here P at 1: that might be okay if correct? We don't know.
- But ""plumb"" has P at 1, L at 2, U at 3, M at 4, B at 5.
  - We know from split that P cannot be at 2 and L cannot be at 3. But in this word, P is at 1 (which is allowed) and L is at 2 (which is also allowed, since the constraint for L only said not at 3). So this is okay.

But does ""plumb"" avoid excluded letters? Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,S,I,T. Plumb has P,L,U,M,B. None are excluded. So valid.

Another word: ""pool"" is only 4 letters.

Or ""dumpy"": D,U,M,P,Y. P is at position 4? Then we must avoid having L? But we must include L because the feedback says L is in the word.

That's crucial: since L got a ""-"" in split, it must be in the word. So any guess must include L? Well, we don't have to, but since we know L is present, we should include it to try to find its position, or we might get negative information? Actually, we know L is in the word, so we can try to place it.

But in the next guess, if we don't put L, we might get an 'x' or '-'. But to maximize information, we should include known present letters when possible.

So our guess should include P and L, without S,I,T (excluded) and without the ones from the first guess.

Also, we have to avoid the positions where we know they were wrong: P not at position 2, L not at position 3.

So, for L, it can be at: 1,2,4,5? Actually, from split, L was at 3 and got '-', meaning it is in the word but not at 3, so it can be at 1,2,4, or 5.

Similarly, P was at 2 and got '-', so it can be at 1,3,4,5.

We have other positions: so if we put P at 1 and L at 2, that's one idea.

Another idea: put P at 4 and L at 1 or 5, etc.

Common letters left: among the available, O, U, H, M, B, D, G, F, K, W, Y, etc.

Let's try to form words:

Option 1: ""plump"" -> P,L,U,M,P. But duplicate P. Also, when we guess, we don't want duplicates unless necessary? The wordle rules allow duplicates, but in this case, we don't know if the secret has duplicate letters, but since in split we didn't get duplicate feedback? Anyway, let's avoid for now.

Option 2: ""plumb"" - as I said: P,L,U,M,B.

Option 3: words like ""dowly"" but not common; ""jumpy"" has J and is less common.

Another: ""lumpy"", which is L,U,M,P,Y. So positions: L at 1, U at 2, M at 3, P at 4, Y at 5.
- P at position 4: which is fine because P cannot be at 2? Yes.
- L at position 1: which is allowed (it can be at 1).
- Also, avoids excluded letters? L,U,M,P,Y: all not in excluded list.

But in ""lumpy"", we have L at 1 and P at 4. We also have U,Y,M.

Compare to constraints: P not at 2 (ok, it's at 4), L not at 3 (ok, it's at 1).

Another word: ""bumpy"" -> B,U,M,P,Y. Here P is at 4 and L? We don't have L, so we must include L. So ""bumpy"" doesn't have L.

So we need a word with both P and L.

Similarly, ""humpy"" no L.

So ""lumpy"" seems good: contains L and P, positions 1 and 4.

But note: in the feedback for split, P and L were both present. So if secret has P and L, lumpy is a valid guess.

Alternatively, ""gulph"" not standard; ""poufy"" no L; ""polyp"" duplicate P? Also, P at 1 and O? But O is available.

But ""polka""? No, because we don't have K? Also K is available? But ""polka"": P,O,L,K,A but A is excluded (from first guess). A was excluded, so cannot use A.

So polka has A? No: polka is P,O,L,K,A? Actually, ""polka"" is P-O-L-K-A? But A is excluded? Yes, since guess 1 had A(x). So secret word has no A? So we cannot use A.

Therefore, we cannot use A.

Similarly, R,A,N,E,S,I,T excluded.

So ""lumpy"" does not use A, so it's okay.

Is there a better word? Maybe ""oomph"" but that has O,O,M,P,H and lacks L? We must have L.

Another word: ""blimp"" -> B,L,I,M,P. But I is excluded? In guess 2, I got 'x', so secret word does not contain I. So cannot use I.

Therefore, ""blimp"" has I which is excluded. Invalid.

So we must avoid I.

""Lumpy"": L,U,M,P,Y. No I and no excluded letters.

Similarly, ""plump"" has U,M,P but P duplicated? And if we use it, it would have P at 1 and 5? But then we don't know if the secret has two P's? Since we have P present, but we don't know if it's more than one? But the feedback for split had only one P and it was '-', but it doesn't say anything about duplicates? Actually, the rules: each letter gets a symbol independently? But if there were two P's, and one was misplaced and the other in wrong or same? In this case, we guessed only one P in split? So the secret could have two P's.

But to simplify, let's avoid duplicates for now unless necessary.

So ""lumpy"" is a better choice: L,U,M,P,Y.

Another option: ""pulpy"": P,U,L,P,Y -> two P's? And L at position 3? We must check: L cannot be at position 3 because in split it was at 3 and got '-', meaning it is in the word but not at 3? Exactly: so L cannot be at 3? So ""pulpy"" has L at position 3? That would be invalid? Positions: 
P at 1? Then U at 2, L at 3, P at 4, Y at 5? So L is at 3? But we know L is not at position 3? Because in guess 2, split had L at 3? So if we put L at 3 again, we would get either '-' or '✓'? But according to feedback, it's not at 3? So we are not supposed to put L at 3? Because the secret word has L but not in position 3, so if we put L at 3, we might get an 'x'? Actually, no: if the secret has L but not at 3, then guessing L at 3 would get '-' only if there is another L? Or maybe for the duplicate? But regardless, the rule: the feedback symbol for each occurrence. In guess 2: the L at 3 was '-', meaning that particular position is wrong? But if we guess L at 3 again? The same thing should happen? It's not efficient.

So to avoid wasted guesses, we should place L at a new position: 1,2,4, or 5.

Therefore, ""pulpy"" has L at 3? So avoid.

Similarly, ""pluck"" has C and U? But C is excluded, from guess 1? C(x) meaning C is not in word? So cannot use C.

So back to ""lumpy"": 
- Position 1: L (new position: 1, which is possible)
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: M (new)
- Position 4: P (should be okay? P not at 2, now at 4)
- Position 5: Y

We are introducing U, M, Y.

Is ""lumpy"" a valid English word? Yes (meaning lumpy, something that has lumps).

We might also consider other words: ""wooly""? But W,O,O,L,Y? But it has O twice? And no P? We must include P? Because P is present.

But note: in lumpy, L is at position 1 and P at 4. From feedback, we know P cannot be at 2 and L cannot be at 3? Which is satisfied? So okay.

Other words? ""bulky"" - B,U,L,K,Y? But K,Y are not excluded? And L at 3? Oh, L at position 3? We avoid L at 3? So same issue.

Cannot put L at 3.

Therefore, ""lumpy"" seems good.

Another: ""golem"" - G,O,L,E,M? But E is excluded? Guess 1: E(x), so E cannot be used? So invalid.

""loamy"" - L,O,A,M,Y? A is excluded? Guess 1: A(x), so cannot use A? Invalid.

""hello"" - H,E,L,L,O? E excluded? And duplicate L? Moreover, E is not allowed? Invalid.

So many restrictions.

So, sticking with ""lumpy"".
