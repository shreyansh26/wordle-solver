We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: - (meaning C is in the secret word but in the wrong position)
 R: x (R is not in the secret word)
 A: x (A is not in the secret word)
 N: x (N is not in the secret word)
 E: x (E is not in the secret word)

 So, from this feedback, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letter 'C', but not in the first position (since in ""crane"", C is the first letter and it's marked as '-' meaning wrong position).
 - The letters R, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word has the letter 'C' in one of the positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

 Also, since the feedback for 'C' is '-' and not 'x', we know that 'C' is present, so we must include it in our next guess, but not in the first position.

 We also know that the secret word does not contain: R, A, N, E.

 We have to choose a new 5-letter word that:
   - Does not contain R, A, N, E.
   - Contains the letter 'C' in a position other than the first.

 Additionally, we want to maximize information by trying new common letters.

 Let's think of words that have 'C' in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 and avoid the letters R, A, N, E.

 Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We can try to use a word that has multiple common consonants and a vowel that we haven't tried (like O, I, U).

 Since the word must have 'C' and we know it's not in the first position, let's try to put 'C' in the second position? But note: we don't know the exact position, so we can try a different position.

 However, note that the feedback only tells us that in the first guess, the first position was wrong for 'C'. It doesn't tell us where it should be. So we can try a word with 'C' in, say, the third position.

 Let's try to think of words that have 'C' and avoid R, A, N, E.

 Example words:
   - Could we use ""CLOMP""? But that has O and M, P. But note: we don't know if O, M, P are in the word. However, we must avoid R, A, N, E.

 But wait: we have to avoid R, A, N, E. So let's avoid those.

 Let me try to come up with a word that has 'C' and uses other common letters.

 Possibilities:
   - ""PICKS"": but that has S and K, and I. However, we don't know about these. But note: we have 6 tries, so we can test multiple.

 However, we must avoid the letters that we know are absent: R, A, N, E.

 Another idea: ""COULD"" -> but that has O, U, L, D. But note: we don't know if these are in the word. Also, 'C' is in the first position? We cannot put 'C' in the first position because the feedback said that in the first guess, the first position was wrong for 'C'. So we must avoid putting 'C' in the first position.

 Therefore, we must choose a word that has 'C' in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

 Let me try to think of words with 'C' in the second position? For example, ""SCALP"" -> but that has S, C, A, L, P. But A is forbidden (we know A is not in the word). So we cannot use A.

 Similarly, we cannot use R, A, N, E.

 So let's try a word without A, R, N, E and with C not in the first position.

 How about ""MUSIC""? 
   - M, U, S, I, C -> C is in the fifth position. 
   - It avoids R, A, N, E.

 But note: we don't know if M, U, S, I are in the word. This is a good candidate because it uses new letters and places C at the end.

 Alternatively, ""OPTIC"": O, P, T, I, C -> again, C at the end, and avoids R, A, N, E.

 Another: ""TOPIC"": T, O, P, I, C -> same.

 But we want to cover as many common letters as possible. The letters we haven't tried and are common: S, T, O, I, L, etc.

 Let's choose ""TOPIC"": 
   T, O, P, I, C

 This way, we test T, O, P, I, and we already know C is present (so we are confirming the position of C and also testing new letters).

 However, note that in the first guess, we had C in the first position and it was wrong. Now we are putting C in the fifth position. If the secret word has C in the fifth, then we'll get a check. If not, we might get a dash or an x? But we know C is in the word, so if it's not in the fifth, we'll get a dash for C.

 But also, we are testing T, O, P, I.

 Alternatively, we could use a word that has C in a different position? But we don't know, so we are trying to cover multiple possibilities.

 Another candidate: ""CLOTH"" -> but C is in the first position? We cannot do that because we know the first position is not C. So we must avoid first position for C.

 How about ""SHOCK"": S, H, O, C, K -> C is in the fourth position. This avoids R, A, N, E.

 But note: we have to make sure we don't use forbidden letters.

 Let me list the forbidden letters: R, A, N, E.

 So both ""TOPIC"" and ""SHOCK"" are valid.

 I think ""TOPIC"" is a good choice because it has two vowels (O and I) and three consonants (T, P, C). Also, T and O are very common.

 Let's go with ""TOPIC"".

 But note: we are on the second guess, and we have 5 more letters to test. We might get more information.

 Alternatively, we could use a word that has the same 'C' but in a different position and also includes other common letters.

 However, I think ""TOPIC"" is a reasonable choice.

 So, next guess: ""topic""

 But note: the word must be valid and in the dictionary. ""TOPIC"" is a valid word.

 Therefore, I will guess ""topic"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is in the secret word but not in the first position (marked with `-`).
- R, A, N, and E are not in the secret word (marked with `x`).

For the next guess:
- Must include C (since it's in the secret word), but not in position 1.
- Must avoid R, A, N, E entirely.
- Should test new common letters to gather more information.

I chose ""topic"" because:
- It includes C in position 5 (testing a new position).
- It avoids forbidden letters (R, A, N, E).
- It introduces new common letters: T, O, P, I (which are high-frequency in English words).
- The word is valid and balances vowels (O, I) and consonants (T, P, C).

- The word is valid and balances vowels (O, I) and consonants (T, P, C).

But note: we don\'t know the exact position, so we can try a different position.\n\n However, note that the feedback only tells us that in the first guess, the first position was wrong for \'C\'. It doesn\'t tell us where it should be. So we can try a word with \'C\' in, say, the third position.\n\n Let\'s try to think of words that have \'C\' and avoid R, A, N, E.\n\n Example words:\n   - Could we use ""CLOMP""? But that has O and M, P. But note: we don\'t know if O, M, P are in the word. However, we must avoid R, A, N, E.\n\n But wait: we have to avoid R, A, N, E. So let\'s avoid those.\n\n Let me try to come up with a word that has \'C\' and uses other common letters.\n\n Possibilities:\n   - ""PICKS"": but that has S and K, and I. However, we don\'t know about these. But note: we have 6 tries, so we can test multiple.\n\n However, we must avoid the letters that we know are absent: R, A, N, E.\n\n Another idea: ""COULD"" -> but that has O, U, L, D. But note: we don\'t know if these are in the word. Also, \'C\' is in the first position? We cannot put \'C\' in the first position because the feedback said that in the first guess, the first position was wrong for \'C\'. So we must avoid putting \'C\' in the first position.\n\n Therefore, we must choose a word that has \'C\' in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.\n\n Let me try to think of words with \'C\' in the second position? For example, ""SCALP"" -> but that has S, C, A, L, P. But A is forbidden (we know A is not in the word). So we cannot use A.\n\n Similarly, we cannot use R, A, N, E.\n\n So let\'s try a word without A, R, N, E and with C not in the first position.\n\n How about ""MUSIC""? \n   - M, U, S, I, C -> C is in the fifth position. \n   - It avoids R, A, N, E.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if M, U, S, I are in the word. This is a good candidate because it uses new letters and places C at the end.\n\n Alternatively, ""OPTIC"": O, P, T, I, C -> again, C at the end, and avoids R, A, N, E.\n\n Another: ""TOPIC"": T, O, P, I, C -> same.\n\n But we want to cover as many common letters as possible. The letters we haven\'t tried and are common: S, T, O, I, L, etc.\n\n Let\'s choose ""TOPIC"": \n   T, O, P, I, C\n\n This way, we test T, O, P, I, and we already know C is present (so we are confirming the position of C and also testing new letters).\n\n However, note that in the first guess, we had C in the first position and it was wrong. Now we are putting C in the fifth position. If the secret word has C in the fifth, then we\'ll get a check. If not, we might get a dash or an x? But we know C is in the word, so if it\'s not in the fifth, we\'ll get a dash for C.\n\n But also, we are testing T, O, P, I.\n\n Alternatively, we could use a word that has C in a different position? But we don\'t know, so we are trying to cover multiple possibilities.\n\n Another candidate: ""CLOTH"" -> but C is in the first position? We cannot do that because we know the first position is not C. So we must avoid first position for C.\n\n How about ""SHOCK"": S, H, O, C, K -> C is in the fourth position. This avoids R, A, N, E.\n\n But note: we have to make sure we don\'t use forbidden letters.\n\n Let me list the forbidden letters: R, A, N, E.\n\n So both ""TOPIC"" and ""SHOCK"" are valid.\n\n I think ""TOPIC"" is a good choice because it has two vowels (O and I) and three consonants (T, P, C). Also, T and O are very common.\n\n Let\'s go with ""TOPIC"".\n\n But note: we are on the second guess, and we have 5 more letters to test. We might get more information.\n\n Alternatively, we could use a word that has the same \'C\' but in a different position and also includes other common letters.\n\n However, I think ""TOPIC"" is a reasonable choice.\n\n So, next guess: ""topic""\n\n But note: the word must be valid and in the dictionary.

We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: - (in the word, wrong position)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""topic""
- T: x (not in the word)
- O: - (in the word, wrong position)
- P: x (not in the word)
- I: x (not in the word)
- C: - (in the word, wrong position)

From this, we can deduce:

1. The secret word contains the letters C and O, but not in the positions they were guessed.
   - For ""crane"", C was in position 1 but is not the first letter of the secret word.
   - For ""topic"", O was in position 2 but is not the second letter of the secret word, and C was in position 5 but is not the fifth letter.

2. The secret word does not contain: R, A, N, E, T, P, I.

3. Therefore, the known absent letters are: R, A, N, E, T, P, I.

4. The known present letters (but position unknown) are: C and O.

We also know that the secret word is 5 letters and must contain these two letters (C and O) and three other letters that are not in the absent list.

We need to choose a new word that:
- Includes C and O (since they are in the word) but not in the positions we already know are wrong.
- Avoids the absent letters: R, A, N, E, T, P, I.
- Uses new letters to gather more information.

Positions where C cannot be:
- Position 1 (from ""crane"")
- Position 5 (from ""topic"")

So C must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

Similarly, for O:
- Position 2 (from ""topic"") is wrong, so O cannot be in position 2. Therefore, O must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

We also note that the word must have 5 distinct letters? Not necessarily, but in Wordle, words can have repeated letters. However, since we haven't encountered any duplicates in feedback, we assume no duplicates for now, but we must be cautious.

But in our case, we have two known letters: C and O. We need three more letters that are not in the absent list.

Available letters (consonants): B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Available vowels: O is already used, and we have U, and sometimes Y. But note: we have only one vowel (O) so far, and we might need more vowels.

Common vowels left: U, and sometimes Y.

We should try to include some of the common consonants and the vowel U.

We also need to place C and O in positions that are not forbidden.

Let's try to form a word that has C and O and three new letters.

Possible positions for C: 2, 3, 4
Possible positions for O: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but note: if we put O in position 3 or 4, it might conflict with C if we put C in the same position? We cannot put two letters in the same position, so we have to assign different positions.)

We can try:

Option 1: O in position 1, C in position 2, and then three new letters. But we don't know if O is in position 1.

But we can test that.

Alternatively, we can try to put O in position 3 and C in position 2, for example.

But we need to choose a word that exists.

Let me think of words that have O and C and avoid the absent letters.

Example: 
- ""COULD"" -> but C is in position 1? We cannot because C cannot be in position 1. Also, it has U and L, D. But C is in position 1 -> invalid.

- ""FOCUS"" -> F, O, C, U, S. 
  - Positions: O in position 2? But we know O cannot be in position 2 (from ""topic"" feedback). So if we put O in position 2, that's invalid? Actually, we can put O in position 2 in our guess, but we know that in the secret word, position 2 is not O. So if we guess ""FOCUS"", then:
    - Position 1: F -> unknown
    - Position 2: O -> we know it's not O in the secret word at position 2, so if we put O there, it will be marked as '-' only if O is in the word but not there, which we already know. But we are trying to find the position of O. So it's okay to guess O in a position we know is wrong? It doesn't give new information. We should avoid putting O in position 2 because we already know it's not there.

So we should avoid putting O in position 2 and C in position 1 or 5.

Therefore, for ""FOCUS"", if we rearrange? We cannot rearrange arbitrarily.

We need a word that has O not in position 2 and C not in position 1 or 5.

Let me try:

- ""CLOUD"" -> but C is in position 1 -> invalid.

- ""COULD"" -> C in position 1 -> invalid.

- ""COUCH"" -> C in position 1 and 4? But we have two C's? And C in position 1 is invalid. Also, we don't know if duplicates are allowed. But let's avoid for now.

- ""SCOLD"" -> S, C, O, L, D -> C is in position 2? That's allowed (since C can be in 2,3,4). O is in position 3. 
  - But we have S, C, O, L, D. None of these are in the absent list. 
  - However, we are using S, L, D which are new.

But note: in ""SCOLD"", C is in position 2 and O in position 3.

We can try this.

Another option: ""JUICY"" -> J, U, I, C, Y. But I is in the absent list (from guess 2: I is x). So we cannot use I.

Another: ""MUCKY"" -> M, U, C, K, Y. 
  - C is in position 3? Then positions: M(1), U(2), C(3), K(4), Y(5). 
  - This avoids absent letters: R,A,N,E,T,P,I are absent, so M,U,C,K,Y are okay.
  - Also, C is in position 3 (which is allowed) and O? We don't have O in this word. But we know O is in the word! So we must include O.

We must include both C and O.

So ""MUCKY"" doesn't have O.

We need a word with both C and O.

Let me try: ""COMFY"" -> C in position 1 -> invalid.

""COMBO"" -> C in position 1 -> invalid.

""OCTAL"" -> O in position 1, C in position 2, T in position 3. But T is absent (from guess 2: T is x). So we cannot use T.

""LOCUS"" -> L, O, C, U, S.
  - Positions: L(1), O(2), C(3), U(4), S(5)
  - But we know O cannot be in position 2 (from ""topic"" feedback). So if we put O in position 2, we know it's wrong. We want to test O in a new position. So we should avoid position 2 for O.

We need to put O in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2). Similarly, C in 2,3,4 (not 1 or 5).

So let's try:

- O in position 1: then C cannot be in 1, so C in 2,3,4. But if O is in 1, then C in 2: word like ""O C ...""
  - Example: ""OCULI"" -> but I is absent.
  - ""OCHRE"" -> but R and E are absent.

- O in position 3: then C can be in 2,4 (since 3 is taken by O). 
  - Example: word like _ O _ _ _ 
    - If C in 2: ""CO"" but then first letter is not C, so first letter is something else. Then we have ""X O C ..."" but we need two more letters. 
    - Or C in 4: ""X O Y C Z""

  - Example: ""FOCUS"" -> but O is in position 2 -> we don't want that.

  - How about ""DOUCE""? D, O, U, C, E -> but E is absent.

  - ""COUCH"" -> C in 1 -> invalid.

  - ""BLOCK"" -> B, L, O, C, K -> O in position 3, C in position 4. 
    - Positions: 1:B, 2:L, 3:O, 4:C, 5:K
    - This avoids absent letters? B, L, O, C, K: none in R,A,N,E,T,P,I. 
    - Also, O is in position 3 (which is new) and C in position 4 (which is new, since we haven't tried C in 4).

  - ""BLOCK"" seems good.

- O in position 4: then C can be in 2,3,5? But C cannot be in 5 (from ""topic"" feedback: position 5 was wrong for C). So C in 2 or 3.
  - Example: word like _ _ _ O _ 
    - If C in 2: ""X C Y O Z""
    - Example: ""SCOWL"" -> S, C, O, W, L -> O is in position 3? Wait, positions: S(1), C(2), O(3), W(4), L(5). So O is in 3, not 4.

  - To have O in 4: ""FOCUS"" has O in 2, not 4.

  - ""LOCUS"" has O in 2.

  - ""FOCAL"" -> F, O, C, A, L -> A is absent.

  - ""DOCKS"" -> D, O, C, K, S -> O in position 2? We don't want O in 2.

  - How about ""CROWD"" -> C in 1 -> invalid.

  - ""VODKA"" -> V, O, D, K, A -> A absent.

  - It's hard to find a word with O in position 4.

- O in position 5: then C in 2,3,4.
  - Example: word ending with O: "" _ _ _ _ O""
    - And C in 2,3, or 4.
    - Example: ""BALCO"" -> but A and L? A is absent. 
    - ""MANGO"" -> M, A, N, G, O -> A and N absent.
    - ""DISCO"" -> D, I, S, C, O -> I is absent.

  - ""JUMBO"" -> J, U, M, B, O -> no C.

  - ""HUMDO"" -> not a word.

  - ""COMBO"" -> C in 1 -> invalid.

  - ""DUMBO"" -> D, U, M, B, O -> no C.

So it seems difficult. Therefore, the best option so far is ""BLOCK"": 
  - B, L, O, C, K
  - O in position 3 (which we haven't tested) and C in position 4 (which we haven't tested).

We also test B, L, K.

Alternatively, we could try ""CLOUD"" but C is in position 1 -> invalid.

Another word: ""COULD"" -> invalid.

""COVET"" -> C in 1, and T absent.

""OUNCE"" -> O in 1, U, N, C, E -> but N and E are absent.

""FLOCK"" -> F, L, O, C, K -> similar to ""BLOCK"", but with F instead of B.
  - Positions: F(1), L(2), O(3), C(4), K(5)
  - This is also good.

""CLOCK"" -> C in 1 -> invalid.

""BLOCK"" and ""FLOCK"" are both valid.

I think ""BLOCK"" is a common word.

But note: we are not sure if the secret word has B or F. We are testing.

We can choose either. Let's go with ""BLOCK"".

But wait, in ""BLOCK"", we have:
  Position 1: B
  Position 2: L
  Position 3: O
  Position 4: C
  Position 5: K

We know that O cannot be in position 2 (which is good because we have it in 3) and C cannot be in position 1 or 5 (we have it in 4, so that's okay).

So I'll go with ""BLOCK"".

But let's confirm the absent letters: R, A, N, E, T, P, I. B, L, O, C, K are not in that list.

So it's valid.

Therefore, the next guess is ""block"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C is in the word but not in position 1 (C(-)), and R, A, N, E are absent (x).
- **Guess 2: ""topic""** → O is in the word but not in position 2 (O(-)), C is in the word but not in position 5 (C(-)), and T, P, I are absent (x).

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed letters in the secret word**: 
   - C (must be in positions 2, 3, or 4, since positions 1 and 5 are invalid per feedback).
   - O (must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5, since position 2 is invalid per feedback).
2. **Absent letters (cannot be in the word)**: R, A, N, E, T, P, I.
3. **Remaining possibilities**: The secret word must include C and O, plus 3 other letters from the unused alphabet (B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z). No duplicates are indicated yet.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Include C and O** in new positions to test:
  - C cannot be in position 1 or 5 → placing it in position 4 (untested).
  - O cannot be in position 2 → placing it in position 3 (untested).
- **Test new high-frequency letters**: B, L, K (common consonants) to maximize information.
- **Avoid absent letters** (R, A, N, E, T, P, I) and reuse C/O only where necessary.

Chose **""BLOCK""** because:
- Positions: B (1), L (2), O (3), C (4), K (5).
- Tests O in position 3 and C in position 4 (both new positions).
- Introduces B, L, K (new letters not yet tested).
- Valid 5-letter word that adheres to feedback constraints.

<guess>block</guess>",block,"We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: - (in the word, wrong position)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""topic""
- T: x (not in the word)
- O: - (in the word, wrong position)
- P: x (not in the word)
- I: x (not in the word)
- C: - (in the word, wrong position)

From this, we can deduce:

1. The secret word contains the letters C and O, but not in the positions they were guessed.
   - For ""crane"", C was in position 1 but is not the first letter of the secret word.
   - For ""topic"", O was in position 2 but is not the second letter of the secret word, and C was in position 5 but is not the fifth letter.

2. The secret word does not contain: R, A, N, E, T, P, I.

3. Therefore, the known absent letters are: R, A, N, E, T, P, I.

4. The known present letters (but position unknown) are: C and O.

We also know that the secret word is 5 letters and must contain these two letters (C and O) and three other letters that are not in the absent list.

We need to choose a new word that:
- Includes C and O (since they are in the word) but not in the positions we already know are wrong.
- Avoids the absent letters: R, A, N, E, T, P, I.
- Uses new letters to gather more information.

Positions where C cannot be:
- Position 1 (from ""crane"")
- Position 5 (from ""topic"")

So C must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

Similarly, for O:
- Position 2 (from ""topic"") is wrong, so O cannot be in position 2. Therefore, O must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

We also note that the word must have 5 distinct letters? Not necessarily, but in Wordle, words can have repeated letters. However, since we haven't encountered any duplicates in feedback, we assume no duplicates for now, but we must be cautious.

But in our case, we have two known letters: C and O. We need three more letters that are not in the absent list.

Available letters (consonants): B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Available vowels: O is already used, and we have U, and sometimes Y. But note: we have only one vowel (O) so far, and we might need more vowels.

Common vowels left: U, and sometimes Y.

We should try to include some of the common consonants and the vowel U.

We also need to place C and O in positions that are not forbidden.

Let's try to form a word that has C and O and three new letters.

Possible positions for C: 2, 3, 4
Possible positions for O: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but note: if we put O in position 3 or 4, it might conflict with C if we put C in the same position? We cannot put two letters in the same position, so we have to assign different positions.)

We can try:

Option 1: O in position 1, C in position 2, and then three new letters. But we don't know if O is in position 1.

But we can test that.

Alternatively, we can try to put O in position 3 and C in position 2, for example.

But we need to choose a word that exists.

Let me think of words that have O and C and avoid the absent letters.

Example: 
- ""COULD"" -> but C is in position 1? We cannot because C cannot be in position 1. Also, it has U and L, D. But C is in position 1 -> invalid.

- ""FOCUS"" -> F, O, C, U, S. 
  - Positions: O in position 2? But we know O cannot be in position 2 (from ""topic"" feedback). So if we put O in position 2, that's invalid? Actually, we can put O in position 2 in our guess, but we know that in the secret word, position 2 is not O. So if we guess ""FOCUS"", then:
    - Position 1: F -> unknown
    - Position 2: O -> we know it's not O in the secret word at position 2, so if we put O there, it will be marked as '-' only if O is in the word but not there, which we already know. But we are trying to find the position of O. So it's okay to guess O in a position we know is wrong? It doesn't give new information. We should avoid putting O in position 2 because we already know it's not there.

So we should avoid putting O in position 2 and C in position 1 or 5.

Therefore, for ""FOCUS"", if we rearrange? We cannot rearrange arbitrarily.

We need a word that has O not in position 2 and C not in position 1 or 5.

Let me try:

- ""CLOUD"" -> but C is in position 1 -> invalid.

- ""COULD"" -> C in position 1 -> invalid.

- ""COUCH"" -> C in position 1 and 4? But we have two C's? And C in position 1 is invalid. Also, we don't know if duplicates are allowed. But let's avoid for now.

- ""SCOLD"" -> S, C, O, L, D -> C is in position 2? That's allowed (since C can be in 2,3,4). O is in position 3. 
  - But we have S, C, O, L, D. None of these are in the absent list. 
  - However, we are using S, L, D which are new.

But note: in ""SCOLD"", C is in position 2 and O in position 3.

We can try this.

Another option: ""JUICY"" -> J, U, I, C, Y. But I is in the absent list (from guess 2: I is x). So we cannot use I.

Another: ""MUCKY"" -> M, U, C, K, Y. 
  - C is in position 3? Then positions: M(1), U(2), C(3), K(4), Y(5). 
  - This avoids absent letters: R,A,N,E,T,P,I are absent, so M,U,C,K,Y are okay.
  - Also, C is in position 3 (which is allowed) and O? We don't have O in this word. But we know O is in the word! So we must include O.

We must include both C and O.

So ""MUCKY"" doesn't have O.

We need a word with both C and O.

Let me try: ""COMFY"" -> C in position 1 -> invalid.

""COMBO"" -> C in position 1 -> invalid.

""OCTAL"" -> O in position 1, C in position 2, T in position 3. But T is absent (from guess 2: T is x). So we cannot use T.

""LOCUS"" -> L, O, C, U, S.
  - Positions: L(1), O(2), C(3), U(4), S(5)
  - But we know O cannot be in position 2 (from ""topic"" feedback). So if we put O in position 2, we know it's wrong. We want to test O in a new position. So we should avoid position 2 for O.

We need to put O in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2). Similarly, C in 2,3,4 (not 1 or 5).

So let's try:

- O in position 1: then C cannot be in 1, so C in 2,3,4. But if O is in 1, then C in 2: word like ""O C ...""
  - Example: ""OCULI"" -> but I is absent.
  - ""OCHRE"" -> but R and E are absent.

- O in position 3: then C can be in 2,4 (since 3 is taken by O). 
  - Example: word like _ O _ _ _ 
    - If C in 2: ""CO"" but then first letter is not C, so first letter is something else. Then we have ""X O C ..."" but we need two more letters. 
    - Or C in 4: ""X O Y C Z""

  - Example: ""FOCUS"" -> but O is in position 2 -> we don't want that.

  - How about ""DOUCE""? D, O, U, C, E -> but E is absent.

  - ""COUCH"" -> C in 1 -> invalid.

  - ""BLOCK"" -> B, L, O, C, K -> O in position 3, C in position 4. 
    - Positions: 1:B, 2:L, 3:O, 4:C, 5:K
    - This avoids absent letters? B, L, O, C, K: none in R,A,N,E,T,P,I. 
    - Also, O is in position 3 (which is new) and C in position 4 (which is new, since we haven't tried C in 4).

  - ""BLOCK"" seems good.

- O in position 4: then C can be in 2,3,5? But C cannot be in 5 (from ""topic"" feedback: position 5 was wrong for C). So C in 2 or 3.
  - Example: word like _ _ _ O _ 
    - If C in 2: ""X C Y O Z""
    - Example: ""SCOWL"" -> S, C, O, W, L -> O is in position 3? Wait, positions: S(1), C(2), O(3), W(4), L(5). So O is in 3, not 4.

  - To have O in 4: ""FOCUS"" has O in 2, not 4.

  - ""LOCUS"" has O in 2.

  - ""FOCAL"" -> F, O, C, A, L -> A is absent.

  - ""DOCKS"" -> D, O, C, K, S -> O in position 2? We don't want O in 2.

  - How about ""CROWD"" -> C in 1 -> invalid.

  - ""VODKA"" -> V, O, D, K, A -> A absent.

  - It's hard to find a word with O in position 4.

- O in position 5: then C in 2,3,4.
  - Example: word ending with O: "" _ _ _ _ O""
    - And C in 2,3, or 4.
    - Example: ""BALCO"" -> but A and L? A is absent. 
    - ""MANGO"" -> M, A, N, G, O -> A and N absent.
    - ""DISCO"" -> D, I, S, C, O -> I is absent.

  - ""JUMBO"" -> J, U, M, B, O -> no C.

  - ""HUMDO"" -> not a word.

  - ""COMBO"" -> C in 1 -> invalid.

  - ""DUMBO"" -> D, U, M, B, O -> no C.

So it seems difficult. Therefore, the best option so far is ""BLOCK"": 
  - B, L, O, C, K
  - O in position 3 (which we haven't tested) and C in position 4 (which we haven't tested).

We also test B, L, K.

Alternatively, we could try ""CLOUD"" but C is in position 1 -> invalid.

Another word: ""COULD"" -> invalid.

""COVET"" -> C in 1, and T absent.

""OUNCE"" -> O in 1, U, N, C, E -> but N and E are absent.

""FLOCK"" -> F, L, O, C, K -> similar to ""BLOCK"", but with F instead of B.
  - Positions: F(1), L(2), O(3), C(4), K(5)
  - This is also good.

""CLOCK"" -> C in 1 -> invalid.

""BLOCK"" and ""FLOCK"" are both valid.

I think ""BLOCK"" is a common word.

But note: we are not sure if the secret word has B or F. We are testing.

We can choose either. Let's go with ""BLOCK"".

But wait, in ""BLOCK"", we have:
  Position 1: B
  Position 2: L
  Position 3: O
  Position 4: C
  Position 5: K

We know that O cannot be in position 2 (which is good because we have it in 3) and C cannot be in position 1 or 5 (we have it in 4, so that's okay).

So I'll go with ""BLOCK"".

But let's confirm the absent letters: R, A, N, E, T, P, I. B, L, O, C, K are not in that list.

So it's valid.

Therefore, the next guess is ""block"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C is in the word but not in position 1 (C(-)), and R, A, N, E are absent (x).
- **Guess 2: ""topic""** → O is in the word but not in position 2 (O(-)), C is in the word but not in position 5 (C(-)), and T, P, I are absent (x).

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed letters in the secret word**: 
   - C (must be in positions 2, 3, or 4, since positions 1 and 5 are invalid per feedback).
   - O (must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5, since position 2 is invalid per feedback).
2. **Absent letters (cannot be in the word)**: R, A, N, E, T, P, I.
3. **Remaining possibilities**: The secret word must include C and O, plus 3 other letters from the unused alphabet (B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z). No duplicates are indicated yet.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Include C and O** in new positions to test:
  - C cannot be in position 1 or 5 → placing it in position 4 (untested).
  - O cannot be in position 2 → placing it in position 3 (untested).
- **Test new high-frequency letters**: B, L, K (common consonants) to maximize information.
- **Avoid absent letters** (R, A, N, E, T, P, I) and reuse C/O only where necessary.

Chose **""BLOCK""** because:
- Positions: B (1), L (2), O (3), C (4), K (5).
- Tests O in position 3 and C in position 4 (both new positions).
- Introduces B, L, K (new letters not yet tested).
- Valid 5-letter word that adheres to feedback constraints.",Guess 3: block -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(-) O(✓) C(-) K(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,SCOLD,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: - (meaning C is in the secret word but in the wrong position)
 R: x (R is not in the secret word)
 A: x (A is not in the secret word)
 N: x (N is not in the secret word)
 E: x (E is not in the secret word)

 So, from this feedback, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letter 'C', but not in the first position (since in ""crane"", C is the first letter and it's marked as '-' meaning wrong position).
 - The letters R, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word has the letter 'C' in one of the positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

 Also, since the feedback for 'C' is '-' and not 'x', we know that 'C' is present, so we must include it in our next guess, but not in the first position.

 We also know that the secret word does not contain: R, A, N, E.

 We have to choose a new 5-letter word that:
   - Does not contain R, A, N, E.
   - Contains the letter 'C' in a position other than the first.

 Additionally, we want to maximize information by trying new common letters.

 Let's think of words that have 'C' in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 and avoid the letters R, A, N, E.

 Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We can try to use a word that has multiple common consonants and a vowel that we haven't tried (like O, I, U).

 Since the word must have 'C' and we know it's not in the first position, let's try to put 'C' in the second position? But note: we don't know the exact position, so we can try a different position.

 However, note that the feedback only tells us that in the first guess, the first position was wrong for 'C'. It doesn't tell us where it should be. So we can try a word with 'C' in, say, the third position.

 Let's try to think of words that have 'C' and avoid R, A, N, E.

 Example words:
   - Could we use ""CLOMP""? But that has O and M, P. But note: we don't know if O, M, P are in the word. However, we must avoid R, A, N, E.

 But wait: we have to avoid R, A, N, E. So let's avoid those.

 Let me try to come up with a word that has 'C' and uses other common letters.

 Possibilities:
   - ""PICKS"": but that has S and K, and I. However, we don't know about these. But note: we have 6 tries, so we can test multiple.

 However, we must avoid the letters that we know are absent: R, A, N, E.

 Another idea: ""COULD"" -> but that has O, U, L, D. But note: we don't know if these are in the word. Also, 'C' is in the first position? We cannot put 'C' in the first position because the feedback said that in the first guess, the first position was wrong for 'C'. So we must avoid putting 'C' in the first position.

 Therefore, we must choose a word that has 'C' in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

 Let me try to think of words with 'C' in the second position? For example, ""SCALP"" -> but that has S, C, A, L, P. But A is forbidden (we know A is not in the word). So we cannot use A.

 Similarly, we cannot use R, A, N, E.

 So let's try a word without A, R, N, E and with C not in the first position.

 How about ""MUSIC""? 
   - M, U, S, I, C -> C is in the fifth position. 
   - It avoids R, A, N, E.

 But note: we don't know if M, U, S, I are in the word. This is a good candidate because it uses new letters and places C at the end.

 Alternatively, ""OPTIC"": O, P, T, I, C -> again, C at the end, and avoids R, A, N, E.

 Another: ""TOPIC"": T, O, P, I, C -> same.

 But we want to cover as many common letters as possible. The letters we haven't tried and are common: S, T, O, I, L, etc.

 Let's choose ""TOPIC"": 
   T, O, P, I, C

 This way, we test T, O, P, I, and we already know C is present (so we are confirming the position of C and also testing new letters).

 However, note that in the first guess, we had C in the first position and it was wrong. Now we are putting C in the fifth position. If the secret word has C in the fifth, then we'll get a check. If not, we might get a dash or an x? But we know C is in the word, so if it's not in the fifth, we'll get a dash for C.

 But also, we are testing T, O, P, I.

 Alternatively, we could use a word that has C in a different position? But we don't know, so we are trying to cover multiple possibilities.

 Another candidate: ""CLOTH"" -> but C is in the first position? We cannot do that because we know the first position is not C. So we must avoid first position for C.

 How about ""SHOCK"": S, H, O, C, K -> C is in the fourth position. This avoids R, A, N, E.

 But note: we have to make sure we don't use forbidden letters.

 Let me list the forbidden letters: R, A, N, E.

 So both ""TOPIC"" and ""SHOCK"" are valid.

 I think ""TOPIC"" is a good choice because it has two vowels (O and I) and three consonants (T, P, C). Also, T and O are very common.

 Let's go with ""TOPIC"".

 But note: we are on the second guess, and we have 5 more letters to test. We might get more information.

 Alternatively, we could use a word that has the same 'C' but in a different position and also includes other common letters.

 However, I think ""TOPIC"" is a reasonable choice.

 So, next guess: ""topic""

 But note: the word must be valid and in the dictionary. ""TOPIC"" is a valid word.

 Therefore, I will guess ""topic"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is in the secret word but not in the first position (marked with `-`).
- R, A, N, and E are not in the secret word (marked with `x`).

For the next guess:
- Must include C (since it's in the secret word), but not in position 1.
- Must avoid R, A, N, E entirely.
- Should test new common letters to gather more information.

I chose ""topic"" because:
- It includes C in position 5 (testing a new position).
- It avoids forbidden letters (R, A, N, E).
- It introduces new common letters: T, O, P, I (which are high-frequency in English words).
- The word is valid and balances vowels (O, I) and consonants (T, P, C).

<guess>topic</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: topic -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(-) P(x) I(x) C(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: - (in the word, wrong position)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""topic""
- T: x (not in the word)
- O: - (in the word, wrong position)
- P: x (not in the word)
- I: x (not in the word)
- C: - (in the word, wrong position)

From this, we can deduce:

1. The secret word contains the letters C and O, but not in the positions they were guessed.
   - For ""crane"", C was in position 1 but is not the first letter of the secret word.
   - For ""topic"", O was in position 2 but is not the second letter of the secret word, and C was in position 5 but is not the fifth letter.

2. The secret word does not contain: R, A, N, E, T, P, I.

3. Therefore, the known absent letters are: R, A, N, E, T, P, I.

4. The known present letters (but position unknown) are: C and O.

We also know that the secret word is 5 letters and must contain these two letters (C and O) and three other letters that are not in the absent list.

We need to choose a new word that:
- Includes C and O (since they are in the word) but not in the positions we already know are wrong.
- Avoids the absent letters: R, A, N, E, T, P, I.
- Uses new letters to gather more information.

Positions where C cannot be:
- Position 1 (from ""crane"")
- Position 5 (from ""topic"")

So C must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

Similarly, for O:
- Position 2 (from ""topic"") is wrong, so O cannot be in position 2. Therefore, O must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

We also note that the word must have 5 distinct letters? Not necessarily, but in Wordle, words can have repeated letters. However, since we haven't encountered any duplicates in feedback, we assume no duplicates for now, but we must be cautious.

But in our case, we have two known letters: C and O. We need three more letters that are not in the absent list.

Available letters (consonants): B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Available vowels: O is already used, and we have U, and sometimes Y. But note: we have only one vowel (O) so far, and we might need more vowels.

Common vowels left: U, and sometimes Y.

We should try to include some of the common consonants and the vowel U.

We also need to place C and O in positions that are not forbidden.

Let's try to form a word that has C and O and three new letters.

Possible positions for C: 2, 3, 4
Possible positions for O: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but note: if we put O in position 3 or 4, it might conflict with C if we put C in the same position? We cannot put two letters in the same position, so we have to assign different positions.)

We can try:

Option 1: O in position 1, C in position 2, and then three new letters. But we don't know if O is in position 1.

But we can test that.

Alternatively, we can try to put O in position 3 and C in position 2, for example.

But we need to choose a word that exists.

Let me think of words that have O and C and avoid the absent letters.

Example: 
- ""COULD"" -> but C is in position 1? We cannot because C cannot be in position 1. Also, it has U and L, D. But C is in position 1 -> invalid.

- ""FOCUS"" -> F, O, C, U, S. 
  - Positions: O in position 2? But we know O cannot be in position 2 (from ""topic"" feedback). So if we put O in position 2, that's invalid? Actually, we can put O in position 2 in our guess, but we know that in the secret word, position 2 is not O. So if we guess ""FOCUS"", then:
    - Position 1: F -> unknown
    - Position 2: O -> we know it's not O in the secret word at position 2, so if we put O there, it will be marked as '-' only if O is in the word but not there, which we already know. But we are trying to find the position of O. So it's okay to guess O in a position we know is wrong? It doesn't give new information. We should avoid putting O in position 2 because we already know it's not there.

So we should avoid putting O in position 2 and C in position 1 or 5.

Therefore, for ""FOCUS"", if we rearrange? We cannot rearrange arbitrarily.

We need a word that has O not in position 2 and C not in position 1 or 5.

Let me try:

- ""CLOUD"" -> but C is in position 1 -> invalid.

- ""COULD"" -> C in position 1 -> invalid.

- ""COUCH"" -> C in position 1 and 4? But we have two C's? And C in position 1 is invalid. Also, we don't know if duplicates are allowed. But let's avoid for now.

- ""SCOLD"" -> S, C, O, L, D -> C is in position 2? That's allowed (since C can be in 2,3,4). O is in position 3. 
  - But we have S, C, O, L, D. None of these are in the absent list. 
  - However, we are using S, L, D which are new.

But note: in ""SCOLD"", C is in position 2 and O in position 3.

We can try this.

Another option: ""JUICY"" -> J, U, I, C, Y. But I is in the absent list (from guess 2: I is x). So we cannot use I.

Another: ""MUCKY"" -> M, U, C, K, Y. 
  - C is in position 3? Then positions: M(1), U(2), C(3), K(4), Y(5). 
  - This avoids absent letters: R,A,N,E,T,P,I are absent, so M,U,C,K,Y are okay.
  - Also, C is in position 3 (which is allowed) and O? We don't have O in this word. But we know O is in the word! So we must include O.

We must include both C and O.

So ""MUCKY"" doesn't have O.

We need a word with both C and O.

Let me try: ""COMFY"" -> C in position 1 -> invalid.

""COMBO"" -> C in position 1 -> invalid.

""OCTAL"" -> O in position 1, C in position 2, T in position 3. But T is absent (from guess 2: T is x). So we cannot use T.

""LOCUS"" -> L, O, C, U, S.
  - Positions: L(1), O(2), C(3), U(4), S(5)
  - But we know O cannot be in position 2 (from ""topic"" feedback). So if we put O in position 2, we know it's wrong. We want to test O in a new position. So we should avoid position 2 for O.

We need to put O in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2). Similarly, C in 2,3,4 (not 1 or 5).

So let's try:

- O in position 1: then C cannot be in 1, so C in 2,3,4. But if O is in 1, then C in 2: word like ""O C ...""
  - Example: ""OCULI"" -> but I is absent.
  - ""OCHRE"" -> but R and E are absent.

- O in position 3: then C can be in 2,4 (since 3 is taken by O). 
  - Example: word like _ O _ _ _ 
    - If C in 2: ""CO"" but then first letter is not C, so first letter is something else. Then we have ""X O C ..."" but we need two more letters. 
    - Or C in 4: ""X O Y C Z""

  - Example: ""FOCUS"" -> but O is in position 2 -> we don't want that.

  - How about ""DOUCE""? D, O, U, C, E -> but E is absent.

  - ""COUCH"" -> C in 1 -> invalid.

  - ""BLOCK"" -> B, L, O, C, K -> O in position 3, C in position 4. 
    - Positions: 1:B, 2:L, 3:O, 4:C, 5:K
    - This avoids absent letters? B, L, O, C, K: none in R,A,N,E,T,P,I. 
    - Also, O is in position 3 (which is new) and C in position 4 (which is new, since we haven't tried C in 4).

  - ""BLOCK"" seems good.

- O in position 4: then C can be in 2,3,5? But C cannot be in 5 (from ""topic"" feedback: position 5 was wrong for C). So C in 2 or 3.
  - Example: word like _ _ _ O _ 
    - If C in 2: ""X C Y O Z""
    - Example: ""SCOWL"" -> S, C, O, W, L -> O is in position 3? Wait, positions: S(1), C(2), O(3), W(4), L(5). So O is in 3, not 4.

  - To have O in 4: ""FOCUS"" has O in 2, not 4.

  - ""LOCUS"" has O in 2.

  - ""FOCAL"" -> F, O, C, A, L -> A is absent.

  - ""DOCKS"" -> D, O, C, K, S -> O in position 2? We don't want O in 2.

  - How about ""CROWD"" -> C in 1 -> invalid.

  - ""VODKA"" -> V, O, D, K, A -> A absent.

  - It's hard to find a word with O in position 4.

- O in position 5: then C in 2,3,4.
  - Example: word ending with O: "" _ _ _ _ O""
    - And C in 2,3, or 4.
    - Example: ""BALCO"" -> but A and L? A is absent. 
    - ""MANGO"" -> M, A, N, G, O -> A and N absent.
    - ""DISCO"" -> D, I, S, C, O -> I is absent.

  - ""JUMBO"" -> J, U, M, B, O -> no C.

  - ""HUMDO"" -> not a word.

  - ""COMBO"" -> C in 1 -> invalid.

  - ""DUMBO"" -> D, U, M, B, O -> no C.

So it seems difficult. Therefore, the best option so far is ""BLOCK"": 
  - B, L, O, C, K
  - O in position 3 (which we haven't tested) and C in position 4 (which we haven't tested).

We also test B, L, K.

Alternatively, we could try ""CLOUD"" but C is in position 1 -> invalid.

Another word: ""COULD"" -> invalid.

""COVET"" -> C in 1, and T absent.

""OUNCE"" -> O in 1, U, N, C, E -> but N and E are absent.

""FLOCK"" -> F, L, O, C, K -> similar to ""BLOCK"", but with F instead of B.
  - Positions: F(1), L(2), O(3), C(4), K(5)
  - This is also good.

""CLOCK"" -> C in 1 -> invalid.

""BLOCK"" and ""FLOCK"" are both valid.

I think ""BLOCK"" is a common word.

But note: we are not sure if the secret word has B or F. We are testing.

We can choose either. Let's go with ""BLOCK"".

But wait, in ""BLOCK"", we have:
  Position 1: B
  Position 2: L
  Position 3: O
  Position 4: C
  Position 5: K

We know that O cannot be in position 2 (which is good because we have it in 3) and C cannot be in position 1 or 5 (we have it in 4, so that's okay).

So I'll go with ""BLOCK"".

But let's confirm the absent letters: R, A, N, E, T, P, I. B, L, O, C, K are not in that list.

So it's valid.

Therefore, the next guess is ""block"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C is in the word but not in position 1 (C(-)), and R, A, N, E are absent (x).
- **Guess 2: ""topic""** → O is in the word but not in position 2 (O(-)), C is in the word but not in position 5 (C(-)), and T, P, I are absent (x).

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed letters in the secret word**: 
   - C (must be in positions 2, 3, or 4, since positions 1 and 5 are invalid per feedback).
   - O (must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5, since position 2 is invalid per feedback).
2. **Absent letters (cannot be in the word)**: R, A, N, E, T, P, I.
3. **Remaining possibilities**: The secret word must include C and O, plus 3 other letters from the unused alphabet (B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z). No duplicates are indicated yet.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Include C and O** in new positions to test:
  - C cannot be in position 1 or 5 → placing it in position 4 (untested).
  - O cannot be in position 2 → placing it in position 3 (untested).
- **Test new high-frequency letters**: B, L, K (common consonants) to maximize information.
- **Avoid absent letters** (R, A, N, E, T, P, I) and reuse C/O only where necessary.

Chose **""BLOCK""** because:
- Positions: B (1), L (2), O (3), C (4), K (5).
- Tests O in position 3 and C in position 4 (both new positions).
- Introduces B, L, K (new letters not yet tested).
- Valid 5-letter word that adheres to feedback constraints.

But note: we don\'t know the exact position, so we can try a different position.\n\n However, note that the feedback only tells us that in the first guess, the first position was wrong for \'C\'. It doesn\'t tell us where it should be. So we can try a word with \'C\' in, say, the third position.\n\n Let\'s try to think of words that have \'C\' and avoid R, A, N, E.\n\n Example words:\n   - Could we use ""CLOMP""? But that has O and M, P. But note: we don\'t know if O, M, P are in the word. However, we must avoid R, A, N, E.\n\n But wait: we have to avoid R, A, N, E. So let\'s avoid those.\n\n Let me try to come up with a word that has \'C\' and uses other common letters.\n\n Possibilities:\n   - ""PICKS"": but that has S and K, and I. However, we don\'t know about these. But note: we have 6 tries, so we can test multiple.\n\n However, we must avoid the letters that we know are absent: R, A, N, E.\n\n Another idea: ""COULD"" -> but that has O, U, L, D. But note: we don\'t know if these are in the word. Also, \'C\' is in the first position? We cannot put \'C\' in the first position because the feedback said that in the first guess, the first position was wrong for \'C\'. So we must avoid putting \'C\' in the first position.\n\n Therefore, we must choose a word that has \'C\' in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.\n\n Let me try to think of words with \'C\' in the second position? For example, ""SCALP"" -> but that has S, C, A, L, P. But A is forbidden (we know A is not in the word). So we cannot use A.\n\n Similarly, we cannot use R, A, N, E.\n\n So let\'s try a word without A, R, N, E and with C not in the first position.\n\n How about ""MUSIC""? \n   - M, U, S, I, C -> C is in the fifth position. \n   - It avoids R, A, N, E.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if M, U, S, I are in the word. This is a good candidate because it uses new letters and places C at the end.\n\n Alternatively, ""OPTIC"": O, P, T, I, C -> again, C at the end, and avoids R, A, N, E.\n\n Another: ""TOPIC"": T, O, P, I, C -> same.\n\n But we want to cover as many common letters as possible. The letters we haven\'t tried and are common: S, T, O, I, L, etc.\n\n Let\'s choose ""TOPIC"": \n   T, O, P, I, C\n\n This way, we test T, O, P, I, and we already know C is present (so we are confirming the position of C and also testing new letters).\n\n However, note that in the first guess, we had C in the first position and it was wrong. Now we are putting C in the fifth position. If the secret word has C in the fifth, then we\'ll get a check. If not, we might get a dash or an x? But we know C is in the word, so if it\'s not in the fifth, we\'ll get a dash for C.\n\n But also, we are testing T, O, P, I.\n\n Alternatively, we could use a word that has C in a different position? But we don\'t know, so we are trying to cover multiple possibilities.\n\n Another candidate: ""CLOTH"" -> but C is in the first position? We cannot do that because we know the first position is not C. So we must avoid first position for C.\n\n How about ""SHOCK"": S, H, O, C, K -> C is in the fourth position. This avoids R, A, N, E.\n\n But note: we have to make sure we don\'t use forbidden letters.\n\n Let me list the forbidden letters: R, A, N, E.\n\n So both ""TOPIC"" and ""SHOCK"" are valid.\n\n I think ""TOPIC"" is a good choice because it has two vowels (O and I) and three consonants (T, P, C). Also, T and O are very common.\n\n Let\'s go with ""TOPIC"".\n\n But note: we are on the second guess, and we have 5 more letters to test. We might get more information.\n\n Alternatively, we could use a word that has the same \'C\' but in a different position and also includes other common letters.\n\n However, I think ""TOPIC"" is a reasonable choice.\n\n So, next guess: ""topic""\n\n But note: the word must be valid and in the dictionary. ""TOPIC"" is a valid word.\n\n Therefore, I will guess ""topic"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C is in the secret word but not in the first position (marked with `-`).\n- R, A, N, and E are not in the secret word (marked with `x`).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include C (since it\'s in the secret word), but not in position 1.\n- Must avoid R, A, N, E entirely.\n- Should test new common letters to gather more information.\n\nI chose ""topic"" because:\n- It includes C in position 5 (testing a new position).\n- It avoids forbidden letters (R, A, N, E).\n- It introduces new common letters: T, O, P, I (which are high-frequency in English words).\n- The word is valid and balances vowels (O, I) and consonants (T, P, C).\n\n<guess>topic</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: topic -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(-) P(x) I(x) C(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: - (in the word, wrong position)\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: x (not in the word)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nGuess 2: ""topic""\n- T: x (not in the word)\n- O: - (in the word, wrong position)\n- P: x (not in the word)\n- I: x (not in the word)\n- C: - (in the word, wrong position)\n\nFrom this, we can deduce:\n\n1. The secret word contains the letters C and O, but not in the positions they were guessed.\n   - For ""crane"", C was in position 1 but is not the first letter of the secret word.\n   - For ""topic"", O was in position 2 but is not the second letter of the secret word, and C was in position 5 but is not the fifth letter.\n\n2. The secret word does not contain: R, A, N, E, T, P, I.\n\n3. Therefore, the known absent letters are: R, A, N, E, T, P, I.\n\n4. The known present letters (but position unknown) are: C and O.\n\nWe also know that the secret word is 5 letters and must contain these two letters (C and O) and three other letters that are not in the absent list.\n\nWe need to choose a new word that:\n- Includes C and O (since they are in the word) but not in the positions we already know are wrong.\n- Avoids the absent letters: R, A, N, E, T, P, I.\n- Uses new letters to gather more information.\n\nPositions where C cannot be:\n- Position 1 (from ""crane"")\n- Position 5 (from ""topic"")\n\nSo C must be in position 2, 3, or 4.\n\nSimilarly, for O:\n- Position 2 (from ""topic"") is wrong, so O cannot be in position 2. Therefore, O must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\nWe also note that the word must have 5 distinct letters? Not necessarily, but in Wordle, words can have repeated letters. However, since we haven\'t encountered any duplicates in feedback, we assume no duplicates for now, but we must be cautious.\n\nBut in our case, we have two known letters: C and O. We need three more letters that are not in the absent list.\n\nAvailable letters (consonants): B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\nAvailable vowels: O is already used, and we have U, and sometimes Y. But note: we have only one vowel (O) so far, and we might need more vowels.\n\nCommon vowels left: U, and sometimes Y.\n\nWe should try to include some of the common consonants and the vowel U.\n\nWe also need to place C and O in positions that are not forbidden.\n\nLet\'s try to form a word that has C and O and three new letters.\n\nPossible positions for C: 2, 3, 4\nPossible positions for O: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but note: if we put O in position 3 or 4, it might conflict with C if we put C in the same position? We cannot put two letters in the same position, so we have to assign different positions.)\n\nWe can try:\n\nOption 1: O in position 1, C in position 2, and then three new letters. But we don\'t know if O is in position 1.\n\nBut we can test that.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to put O in position 3 and C in position 2, for example.\n\nBut we need to choose a word that exists.\n\nLet me think of words that have O and C and avoid the absent letters.\n\nExample: \n- ""COULD"" -> but C is in position 1? We cannot because C cannot be in position 1. Also, it has U and L, D. But C is in position 1 -> invalid.\n\n- ""FOCUS"" -> F, O, C, U, S. \n  - Positions: O in position 2? But we know O cannot be in position 2 (from ""topic"" feedback). So if we put O in position 2, that\'s invalid? Actually, we can put O in position 2 in our guess, but we know that in the secret word, position 2 is not O. So if we guess ""FOCUS"", then:\n    - Position 1: F -> unknown\n    - Position 2: O -> we know it\'s not O in the secret word at position 2, so if we put O there, it will be marked as \'-\' only if O is in the word but not there, which we already know. But we are trying to find the position of O. So it\'s okay to guess O in a position we know is wrong? It doesn\'t give new information. We should avoid putting O in position 2 because we already know it\'s not there.\n\nSo we should avoid putting O in position 2 and C in position 1 or 5.\n\nTherefore, for ""FOCUS"", if we rearrange? We cannot rearrange arbitrarily.\n\nWe need a word that has O not in position 2 and C not in position 1 or 5.\n\nLet me try:\n\n- ""CLOUD"" -> but C is in position 1 -> invalid.\n\n- ""COULD"" -> C in position 1 -> invalid.\n\n- ""COUCH"" -> C in position 1 and 4? But we have two C\'s? And C in position 1 is invalid. Also, we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. But let\'s avoid for now.\n\n- ""SCOLD"" -> S, C, O, L, D -> C is in position 2? That\'s allowed (since C can be in 2,3,4). O is in position 3. \n  - But we have S, C, O, L, D. None of these are in the absent list. \n  - However, we are using S, L, D which are new.\n\nBut note: in ""SCOLD"", C is in position 2 and O in position 3.\n\nWe can try this.\n\nAnother option: ""JUICY"" -> J, U, I, C, Y. But I is in the absent list (from guess 2: I is x). So we cannot use I.\n\nAnother: ""MUCKY"" -> M, U, C, K, Y. \n  - C is in position 3? Then positions: M(1), U(2), C(3), K(4), Y(5). \n  - This avoids absent letters: R,A,N,E,T,P,I are absent, so M,U,C,K,Y are okay.\n  - Also, C is in position 3 (which is allowed) and O? We don\'t have O in this word. But we know O is in the word! So we must include O.\n\nWe must include both C and O.\n\nSo ""MUCKY"" doesn\'t have O.\n\nWe need a word with both C and O.\n\nLet me try: ""COMFY"" -> C in position 1 -> invalid.\n\n""COMBO"" -> C in position 1 -> invalid.\n\n""OCTAL"" -> O in position 1, C in position 2, T in position 3. But T is absent (from guess 2: T is x). So we cannot use T.\n\n""LOCUS"" -> L, O, C, U, S.\n  - Positions: L(1), O(2), C(3), U(4), S(5)\n  - But we know O cannot be in position 2 (from ""topic"" feedback). So if we put O in position 2, we know it\'s wrong. We want to test O in a new position. So we should avoid position 2 for O.\n\nWe need to put O in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2). Similarly, C in 2,3,4 (not 1 or 5).\n\nSo let\'s try:\n\n- O in position 1: then C cannot be in 1, so C in 2,3,4. But if O is in 1, then C in 2: word like ""O C ...""\n  - Example: ""OCULI"" -> but I is absent.\n  - ""OCHRE"" -> but R and E are absent.\n\n- O in position 3: then C can be in 2,4 (since 3 is taken by O). \n  - Example: word like _ O _ _ _ \n    - If C in 2: ""CO"" but then first letter is not C, so first letter is something else. Then we have ""X O C ..."" but we need two more letters. \n    - Or C in 4: ""X O Y C Z""\n\n  - Example: ""FOCUS"" -> but O is in position 2 -> we don\'t want that.\n\n  - How about ""DOUCE""? D, O, U, C, E -> but E is absent.\n\n  - ""COUCH"" -> C in 1 -> invalid.\n\n  - ""BLOCK"" -> B, L, O, C, K -> O in position 3, C in position 4. \n    - Positions: 1:B, 2:L, 3:O, 4:C, 5:K\n    - This avoids absent letters? B, L, O, C, K: none in R,A,N,E,T,P,I. \n    - Also, O is in position 3 (which is new) and C in position 4 (which is new, since we haven\'t tried C in 4).\n\n  - ""BLOCK"" seems good.\n\n- O in position 4: then C can be in 2,3,5? But C cannot be in 5 (from ""topic"" feedback: position 5 was wrong for C). So C in 2 or 3.\n  - Example: word like _ _ _ O _ \n    - If C in 2: ""X C Y O Z""\n    - Example: ""SCOWL"" -> S, C, O, W, L -> O is in position 3? Wait, positions: S(1), C(2), O(3), W(4), L(5). So O is in 3, not 4.\n\n  - To have O in 4: ""FOCUS"" has O in 2, not 4.\n\n  - ""LOCUS"" has O in 2.\n\n  - ""FOCAL"" -> F, O, C, A, L -> A is absent.\n\n  - ""DOCKS"" -> D, O, C, K, S -> O in position 2? We don\'t want O in 2.\n\n  - How about ""CROWD"" -> C in 1 -> invalid.\n\n  - ""VODKA"" -> V, O, D, K, A -> A absent.\n\n  - It\'s hard to find a word with O in position 4.\n\n- O in position 5: then C in 2,3,4.\n  - Example: word ending with O: "" _ _ _ _ O""\n    - And C in 2,3, or 4.\n    - Example: ""BALCO"" -> but A and L? A is absent. \n    - ""MANGO"" -> M, A, N, G, O -> A and N absent.\n    - ""DISCO"" -> D, I, S, C, O -> I is absent.\n\n  - ""JUMBO"" -> J, U, M, B, O -> no C.\n\n  - ""HUMDO"" -> not a word.\n\n  - ""COMBO"" -> C in 1 -> invalid.\n\n  - ""DUMBO"" -> D, U, M, B, O -> no C.\n\nSo it seems difficult. Therefore, the best option so far is ""BLOCK"": \n  - B, L, O, C, K\n  - O in position 3 (which we haven\'t tested) and C in position 4 (which we haven\'t tested).\n\nWe also test B, L, K.\n\nAlternatively, we could try ""CLOUD"" but C is in position 1 -> invalid.\n\nAnother word: ""COULD"" -> invalid.\n\n""COVET"" -> C in 1, and T absent.\n\n""OUNCE"" -> O in 1, U, N, C, E -> but N and E are absent.\n\n""FLOCK"" -> F, L, O, C, K -> similar to ""BLOCK"", but with F instead of B.\n  - Positions: F(1), L(2), O(3), C(4), K(5)\n  - This is also good.\n\n""CLOCK"" -> C in 1 -> invalid.\n\n""BLOCK"" and ""FLOCK"" are both valid.\n\nI think ""BLOCK"" is a common word.\n\nBut note: we are not sure if the secret word has B or F. We are testing.\n\nWe can choose either. Let\'s go with ""BLOCK"".\n\nBut wait, in ""BLOCK"", we have:\n  Position 1: B\n  Position 2: L\n  Position 3: O\n  Position 4: C\n  Position 5: K\n\nWe know that O cannot be in position 2 (which is good because we have it in 3) and C cannot be in position 1 or 5 (we have it in 4, so that\'s okay).\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""BLOCK"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm the absent letters: R, A, N, E, T, P, I. B, L, O, C, K are not in that list.\n\nSo it\'s valid.\n\nTherefore, the next guess is ""block"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C is in the word but not in position 1 (C(-)), and R, A, N, E are absent (x).\n- **Guess 2: ""topic""** → O is in the word but not in position 2 (O(-)), C is in the word but not in position 5 (C(-)), and T, P, I are absent (x).\n\n### Key Insights:\n1. **Confirmed letters in the secret word**: \n   - C (must be in positions 2, 3, or 4, since positions 1 and 5 are invalid per feedback).\n   - O (must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5, since position 2 is invalid per feedback).\n2. **Absent letters (cannot be in the word)**: R, A, N, E, T, P, I.\n3. **Remaining possibilities**: The secret word must include C and O, plus 3 other letters from the unused alphabet (B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

We are given feedback for the third guess ""block"":
- B: x (not in the word)
- L: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- O: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position, position 3)
- C: - (in the word, but not in position 4)
- K: x (not in the word)

So, from this, we know:
1. The secret word has the letter 'O' in the third position (position 3). This is fixed.
2. The secret word contains the letters 'L' and 'C', but not in the positions we guessed.
   - For 'L': it is in the word but not in position 2. So it must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5. But position 3 is taken by 'O', so 'L' must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
   - For 'C': it is in the word but not in position 4. We already knew it couldn't be in position 1 or 5 (from previous feedback), and now position 4 is also wrong. Therefore, the only possibility left for 'C' is position 2 (since positions 1,4,5 are invalid, and position 3 is taken by 'O'). 
     - Let me double-check: 
        - From guess1: C not in 1.
        - From guess2: C not in 5.
        - From guess3: C not in 4.
        - The only position left for C is 2 (since 3 is taken by O). 
     - Therefore, C must be in position 2.

3. The letters B and K are not in the word.

Also, from previous feedback, we know the absent letters: R, A, N, E, T, P, I, and now B and K.

So, the secret word has:
- Position 2: C (we just deduced)
- Position 3: O (from the checkmark)

And the word also contains 'L' (which is not in position 2, but now position 2 is taken by C, so L must be in position 1, 4, or 5).

Additionally, we have two more letters to find (since the word is 5 letters) and they must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the absent letters.

Absent letters: R, A, N, E, T, P, I, B, K.

So, available letters: D, F, G, H, J, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. (and we also have L which is present, but we don't know its position yet).

The structure of the word is:
Position 1: ? (could be L or a new letter)
Position 2: C (fixed)
Position 3: O (fixed)
Position 4: ? 
Position 5: ?

We know the word has an 'L' that is not in position 2, so it must be in 1, 4, or 5.

We need to choose a word that fits:
  [1] = L or a new letter (but if not L, then L must be in 4 or 5)
  [2] = C
  [3] = O
  [4] = ? (could be L or a new letter)
  [5] = ? (could be L or a new letter)

But note: the word must have exactly one L? We don't know if there are duplicates, but so far we haven't seen any. We'll assume no duplicates for now.

So, the word is: _ C O _ _

And one of the blanks (1,4,5) must be L, and the other two are new letters from the available set.

We also have to avoid the absent letters.

Now, we can try to form words that match this pattern.

Possible words:
- If L is in position 1: ""L C O _ _""
  - Examples: ""LCO"" + two letters. Common words: ""SCOWL"" but S is available, but W is available? But ""SCOWL"" has S,C,O,W,L -> but L is at the end? Actually, ""SCOWL"" is S-C-O-W-L, so positions: S1, C2, O3, W4, L5. But that would have L in position 5, not 1.

  - ""L"" in position 1: words like ""Locus"" but we have O in 3, so ""L C O ? ?"". 
    - ""LCO"" words: ""LCO"" is not common. 
    - ""Locus"" would be L O C U S -> but that has O in position 2, not 3.

  - How about ""Lochs"": L O C H S -> but again, O in 2.

  - We need O in 3. So ""L C O _ _"": 
    - Possibilities: ""LCOMA""? But A is absent.
    - ""LCOOL""? But O repeated and L at the end? Not 5 distinct? But we don't know about duplicates. Also, O is repeated? But we have O in position 3, and if we put O in 4 or 5, that would be a duplicate. We haven't had any duplicate feedback, so it's possible but less likely.

  - I can't think of a common word starting with ""LCO"" with O in the third position. 

- If L is in position 4: then the word is _ C O L _
  - Examples: ""SCOLD"" -> S C O L D -> but we have S and D. 
    - S: available, D: available.
    - But in our feedback, we haven't tested S or D. 
    - However, we know that in ""block"", L was in position 2 and was marked as '-' meaning it's in the word but not there. Now we are putting L in position 4. If the secret word has L in 4, then we'll get a check for L? But we are guessing to test.

  - Other words: ""FCOLD""? Not a word.
  - ""VCOLD""? Not a word.

  - Common words: 
      - ""SCOLD"" is one. 
      - Also, ""ICOLY""? Not a word.

- If L is in position 5: then the word is _ C O _ L
  - Examples: ""SCOWL"" -> S C O W L -> which is valid.

So the two main candidates are:
  - ""SCOLD"" (if L is in position 4)
  - ""SCOWL"" (if L is in position 5)

But note: we also have to consider that the word might have L in position 1, but we couldn't find a common word. So let's focus on these two.

We can use one of these as our next guess.

But note: we also have to consider that the word might not have S? We don't know. We are testing.

Alternatively, we could use a word that uses other letters to test more possibilities.

But we have limited guesses left (3 more after this), so we want to maximize information.

However, we are very close. We know the word has the form _ C O _ _ and contains L in one of positions 1,4,5. But position 1 seems unlikely because of the lack of common words, so let's focus on positions 4 and 5.

We can guess ""SCOLD"" to test:
  - If L is in position 4, then we'll get a check for L and also test S and D.
  - If not, then we might get feedback that helps.

But note: we also have to account for the possibility that L is in position 1, but we don't have a candidate. So we might need to try a different letter for position 1.

Another idea: we know C is in position 2 and O in 3, so the word is ? C O ? ?

We also know L is present. We can try to use a word that has L in position 1,4, or 5 and uses common letters for the others.

But let's list possible words:

- With L in 1: ""LCO"" + two letters. The only word I can think of is ""Locus"" but that doesn't fit. Or ""Lochs"" but O is in 2. So maybe there are no common words with ""LCO"" in the first three letters? So L is probably not in 1.

Therefore, L must be in 4 or 5.

So the word is either:
  Option A: _ C O L _  (L in 4)
  Option B: _ C O _ L  (L in 5)

For Option A: _ C O L _
  - The first and last positions are unknown. The last position can be any letter (from available set) that forms a word.
  - Examples: 
      - ""SCOLD"" -> S and D
      - ""SCOLL"" -> not common, and duplicate L? 
      - ""COLLY"" -> C in 1? invalid.

  - Other: ""DCOLE""? Not a word.

  - So ""SCOLD"" is a candidate.

For Option B: _ C O _ L
  - Examples: 
      - ""SCOWL"" -> S and W
      - ""SCOWL"" is valid.

  - Also, ""SCOWL"" uses S and W.

We can choose between ""SCOLD"" and ""SCOWL"". Both test S in position 1 and L in either 4 or 5.

But note: we also have to consider that the word might not have S. So we might want to test without S? But we don't have many letters left.

Alternatively, we can use a word that doesn't use S to test other letters.

But let's see the available letters: D, F, G, H, J, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try to use a word that has, say, H or U or other common letters.

But we are constrained by the pattern.

Another candidate: for Option A: ""CHOLY""? But H and Y. But ""CHOLY"" is not a common word? I'm not sure. ""Choly"" might not be valid.

""CHOLE"" -> but E is absent.

""CHOMP"" -> P absent.

For Option B: ""COHOL""? Not a word.

""COWAL""? Not a word.

So the only common words I can think of are ""SCOLD"" and ""SCOWL"".

We can choose one. Let's pick ""SCOLD"" because it uses D, which is a common letter, and we can see if D is in the word.

But note: if we guess ""SCOLD"", then:
  Position 1: S -> if S is in the word and in the correct position, we get a check. If not, we get dash or x.
  Position 2: C -> we know it's correct (since we deduced it must be in position 2) so we should get a check.
  Position 3: O -> we know it's correct, so check.
  Position 4: L -> if L is in position 4, we get a check. If not, we get dash (if L is in the word but wrong position) or x (if not, but we know L is in the word, so it must be dash or check). But if we get dash for L, then L must be in position 5 (since position 1 is unlikely and we have no other positions).
  Position 5: D -> if D is in the word and correct, check; else, dash or x.

But note: if L is in position 5, then in ""SCOLD"", L is in position 4 and that would be wrong, so we get dash for L and then we know L is in 5. Then we can guess a word with L in 5.

Similarly, if we guess ""SCOWL"", we test W.

But we don't have a strong reason to prefer one over the other.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has L in position 5 and uses a different first letter, to test more letters.

For example, ""WHOLE"" -> but H, W, E -> E is absent.

""WHOOP"" -> O repeated and P absent.

""CLOMP"" -> C in 1 -> invalid.

""FLOCK"" -> we already tried and B and K are absent? In guess3 we had ""block"" and B and K are absent, so we cannot use F? We haven't tested F.

But in ""FLOCK"", F is in position 1. But we don't know if F is in the word.

But we can try ""FCO"" ... but we need L in 4 or 5.

How about ""FOCAL"" -> but A absent.

""FOLIC"" -> but I absent.

So I think ""SCOLD"" and ""SCOWL"" are the best bets.

Let me choose ""SCOLD"" for the next guess.

But note: we must ensure we don't use absent letters. In ""SCOLD"", we have S, C, O, L, D. 
- C and O are known present. 
- L is known present. 
- S and D: not tested yet, and not in the absent list.

So it's valid.

Therefore, I'll guess ""scold"".Based on the feedback:

- We deduced that the secret word must have:
  - Position 2: C (from process of elimination of invalid positions)
  - Position 3: O (from the checkmark in guess 3)
  - The letter L is present but not in position 2 (from guess 3 feedback), so it must be in position 1, 4, or 5. However, position 1 is unlikely due to lack of common words, so we focus on positions 4 or 5.
- The word structure is: _ C O _ _
- We considered common words fitting this pattern and avoiding absent letters (R, A, N, E, T, P, I, B, K). The top candidates are:
  - ""SCOLD"" (tests L in position 4 and S/D)
  - ""SCOWL"" (tests L in position 5 and S/W)

Chose ""SCOLD"" to test:
- S in position 1 (new letter)
- C in position 2 (expected correct)
- O in position 3 (expected correct)
- L in position 4 (to check if L is here)
- D in position 5 (new letter)

This guess will help confirm the positions of C and O (which should be correct) and provide new information on S, L, and D.

</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C is in the word but not position 1 (`C(-)`), and R, A, N, E are absent (`x`).
- **Guess 2: ""topic""** → O is in the word but not position 2 (`O(-)`), C is in the word but not position 5 (`C(-)`), and T, P, I are absent (`x`).
- **Guess 3: ""block""** → O is correct in position 3 (`O(✓)`), L is in the word but not position 2 (`L(-)`), C is in the word but not position 4 (`C(-)`), and B, K are absent (`x`).

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed letters and positions**:
   - **O** is in **position 3** (fixed).
   - **C** must be in **position 2** (since positions 1, 4, and 5 are invalidated by prior feedback).
   - **L** is present but not in position 2 (must be in position 1, 4, or 5).
2. **Absent letters**: R, A, N, E, T, P, I, B, K (cannot be in the word).
3. **Word structure**: The secret word is `_ C O _ _` with **L** in position 1, 4, or 5, and the remaining letters from the unused alphabet (D, F, G, H, J, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- **Test the position of L**: Since L cannot be in position 2 and position 3 is O, L must be in 1, 4, or 5. Common words fitting `_ C O _ _` with L include:
  - **""SCOLD""** (L in position 4) or **""SCOWL""** (L in position 5).
- **Maximize information**: Choose a word that tests new high-frequency letters (e.g., S, D) and validates L's position.
- **Avoid absent letters** and reuse known letters (C, O) in their deduced positions.

Chose **""SCOLD""** because:
- Positions: S (1), C (2), O (3), L (4), D (5).
- Tests L in position 4 (a likely spot per common words).
- Tests S (position 1) and D (position 5) as new letters.
- If L is not in position 4, feedback will confirm if L is in position 1 or 5 (narrowing options).
- C (position 2) and O (position 3) are expected to be correct, providing validation.

<guess>scold</guess>",scold,"We are given feedback for the third guess ""block"":
- B: x (not in the word)
- L: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- O: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position, position 3)
- C: - (in the word, but not in position 4)
- K: x (not in the word)

So, from this, we know:
1. The secret word has the letter 'O' in the third position (position 3). This is fixed.
2. The secret word contains the letters 'L' and 'C', but not in the positions we guessed.
   - For 'L': it is in the word but not in position 2. So it must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5. But position 3 is taken by 'O', so 'L' must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
   - For 'C': it is in the word but not in position 4. We already knew it couldn't be in position 1 or 5 (from previous feedback), and now position 4 is also wrong. Therefore, the only possibility left for 'C' is position 2 (since positions 1,4,5 are invalid, and position 3 is taken by 'O'). 
     - Let me double-check: 
        - From guess1: C not in 1.
        - From guess2: C not in 5.
        - From guess3: C not in 4.
        - The only position left for C is 2 (since 3 is taken by O). 
     - Therefore, C must be in position 2.

3. The letters B and K are not in the word.

Also, from previous feedback, we know the absent letters: R, A, N, E, T, P, I, and now B and K.

So, the secret word has:
- Position 2: C (we just deduced)
- Position 3: O (from the checkmark)

And the word also contains 'L' (which is not in position 2, but now position 2 is taken by C, so L must be in position 1, 4, or 5).

Additionally, we have two more letters to find (since the word is 5 letters) and they must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the absent letters.

Absent letters: R, A, N, E, T, P, I, B, K.

So, available letters: D, F, G, H, J, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. (and we also have L which is present, but we don't know its position yet).

The structure of the word is:
Position 1: ? (could be L or a new letter)
Position 2: C (fixed)
Position 3: O (fixed)
Position 4: ? 
Position 5: ?

We know the word has an 'L' that is not in position 2, so it must be in 1, 4, or 5.

We need to choose a word that fits:
  [1] = L or a new letter (but if not L, then L must be in 4 or 5)
  [2] = C
  [3] = O
  [4] = ? (could be L or a new letter)
  [5] = ? (could be L or a new letter)

But note: the word must have exactly one L? We don't know if there are duplicates, but so far we haven't seen any. We'll assume no duplicates for now.

So, the word is: _ C O _ _

And one of the blanks (1,4,5) must be L, and the other two are new letters from the available set.

We also have to avoid the absent letters.

Now, we can try to form words that match this pattern.

Possible words:
- If L is in position 1: ""L C O _ _""
  - Examples: ""LCO"" + two letters. Common words: ""SCOWL"" but S is available, but W is available? But ""SCOWL"" has S,C,O,W,L -> but L is at the end? Actually, ""SCOWL"" is S-C-O-W-L, so positions: S1, C2, O3, W4, L5. But that would have L in position 5, not 1.

  - ""L"" in position 1: words like ""Locus"" but we have O in 3, so ""L C O ? ?"". 
    - ""LCO"" words: ""LCO"" is not common. 
    - ""Locus"" would be L O C U S -> but that has O in position 2, not 3.

  - How about ""Lochs"": L O C H S -> but again, O in 2.

  - We need O in 3. So ""L C O _ _"": 
    - Possibilities: ""LCOMA""? But A is absent.
    - ""LCOOL""? But O repeated and L at the end? Not 5 distinct? But we don't know about duplicates. Also, O is repeated? But we have O in position 3, and if we put O in 4 or 5, that would be a duplicate. We haven't had any duplicate feedback, so it's possible but less likely.

  - I can't think of a common word starting with ""LCO"" with O in the third position. 

- If L is in position 4: then the word is _ C O L _
  - Examples: ""SCOLD"" -> S C O L D -> but we have S and D. 
    - S: available, D: available.
    - But in our feedback, we haven't tested S or D. 
    - However, we know that in ""block"", L was in position 2 and was marked as '-' meaning it's in the word but not there. Now we are putting L in position 4. If the secret word has L in 4, then we'll get a check for L? But we are guessing to test.

  - Other words: ""FCOLD""? Not a word.
  - ""VCOLD""? Not a word.

  - Common words: 
      - ""SCOLD"" is one. 
      - Also, ""ICOLY""? Not a word.

      - ""SCOWL"" -> S and W
      - ""SCOWL"" is valid.

  - Also, ""SCOWL"" uses S and W.

But in ""FLOCK"", F is in position 1. But we don't know if F is in the word.

But we can try ""FCO"" ... but we need L in 4 or 5.
