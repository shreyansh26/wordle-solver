We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane""
 Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)

 Interpretation:
 - E is in the word and in the correct position (last letter). So the secret word ends with E.
 - A is in the word but not in the second position (since it's marked ""-"" meaning wrong position). So A is present, but elsewhere.
 - C, R, N are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word:
 - Must end with E: _ _ _ _ E
 - Contains the letter A, but not as the second letter (since in ""crane"", A was in position 2).
 - Does not contain C, R, N.

 Now, for the second guess, we want to:
 1. Try to place A in a different position (since it's not in position 2).
 2. Include other common letters that we haven't tried yet (excluding C, R, N).
 3. We know the last letter is E, so we keep that.

 Let's think of letters that are common and we haven't tried: 
 We have tried C, R, A, N, E. So avoid C, R, N. But we know A and E are present (E in the last spot, A somewhere else).

 We can use other vowels or common consonants: like S, T, L, I, O, B, D, G, H, K, M, P, U, etc.

 Also, we must avoid putting A in position 2 again (but it could be in position 1, 3, or 4).

 A good strategy is to use a word that has A in a new position (say position 1 or 3 or 4) and includes other new letters.

 Considering the feedback, the word must be of the form: [letter] [letter] [letter] [letter] E

 Since A is not in position 2, let's try putting A in position 1. Then the word would start with A.

 Also, we want to cover new letters. Let's try a word like ""ALIKE"", but note we haven't tried L, I, K.

 But wait: the last letter is E which we know. And we want to use the known E at the end.

 Potential word: ""ABUSE"" - but we don't know about B, U, S and it has A at position 1 and E at the end. However, note that in the first guess we had A at position 2 and it was present, so it's possible that A appears elsewhere and we don't know if it can be at start? Actually, we don't know yet. But we must not put A at position 2 because that was already tried and wrong position? Actually, the feedback only tells us that in the word ""crane"", A was in the word but not at the correct position. It might be that the correct position is position 1? We don't know until we try.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in a position we haven't tried: positions 1, 3, or 4.

 Let's list words that end with E and contain A and exclude C, R, N.

 Some options:

 - ""SAUTE"": S at start, A at position 2? But feedback told us that when A was in position 2 (in crane) it was present but wrong position. Now, if we put A in position 2 again? Actually, we can put A in position 2 again? But note: the feedback didn't say A cannot be in position 2, it said it is in the word but not in that position. So it could be that the word actually has A in a different position. However, if we put A in position 2 again and it still is not the correct position, then we know it must be placed elsewhere. But we want to maximize information. Maybe avoid position 2 for now until we test another position.

 So let's avoid position 2 for A for now.

 We can try:

 Position 1: A? => word pattern A _ _ _ E
 Examples: ABASE, ABATE, ADAGE, AGATE, ALATE, ALIKE, ALONE? (note: avoid N -> so no ALONE). 

 But note: we don't know if A is at position 1. It could be at position 3 or 4.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in position 3 or 4.

 Also, we need to include other new letters.

 Common letters: Let's try S, T, L, I, O, etc.

 After excluding C, R, N, we are left with many. What about:

 - ""PLATE"": P L A T E -> but we know E is at end? Yes. And A is at position 3? That's a new position. Also, we test P, L, T.

 However, note: the feedback for our first guess (crane) had A at position 2 being present but wrong. Now in ""PLATE"", A is at position 3. It might be that the correct position for A is 3? Not necessarily, it could be 1 or 4. But at least we test position 3.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"": S L A T E -> but that has A at position 3 again.

 But note: we don't know if S, L, T are in the word. We haven't tested them.

 Another idea: if we use a word with A at position 1, we can also test other common letters.

 Let me choose ""ADIEU"" but note: it ends with U, not E. We need E at the end.

 Wait, we must have E at the end. So we need a word that ends with E and has A and doesn't use C, R, N.

 Also, note we are not forced to include A. But we know A is in the word, so we should include it.

 Let me choose ""SAUTE"": S A U T E -> but that has A at position 2. We are unsure about position 2? We know from feedback that A is not in position 2? Actually, the feedback only says A is in the word but not at position 2. So it could be in the word at position 1, 3 or 4? However, note: the feedback does not preclude that position 2 might be A? Wait, no: if the secret word had A in position 2, then when we guessed ""crane"" with A in position 2, it would have been marked with a check. Since it was not, we know A is not in position 2. Therefore, we must avoid putting A in position 2? Or we can put it but we already know it's wrong? Actually, we can put it again to confirm? But that might be a waste. Better to test a different position.

 So let's choose a word with A in position 1: Examples:

 - ""ABASE"": A B A S E -> but note, repeated A. We haven't tested B and S. However, it's valid. But with repeated letters? We don't know if the word has repeated letters. It's possible.

 Feedback: we know A is in the word, but if the secret word has two A's? Our feedback for ""crane"" didn't indicate that. But note: when we guessed ""crane"", we only had one A and it was marked present. That doesn't rule out two A's.

 However, let's avoid repetition for now.

 Let me choose ""AGAPE"": but again two A's? 

 Or ""ADOBE"": no C,R,N? A D O B E -> O and B are new? And A at position 1? That's valid.

 But ""ADOBE"" ends with E? Yes.

 Alternatively, ""ALIKE"": A L I K E -> A at 1, and ends with E? Yes.

 Let's go with ""ALIKE"": we test A in position 1 and new letters L, I, K.

 But note: we know the word has E at the end and we have E in position 5 again? Actually, in feedback we already know E is at position 5. But guessing a word with E at position 5 again is fine because we can confirm and also test the rest.

 However, in position 1 we put A. We don't know if A should be at position 1 or not.

 Also, we are testing L, I, K.

 Alternatively, we can also try ""STALE"": S T A L E -> A at position 3? That's a new position. And S, T, L are new.

 Since we don't know where A is, testing position 3 is as good as position 1? Actually, we are testing two possibilities: position 1 and position 3. We can do either.

 I think ""STALE"" is a good candidate because S, T, L are common letters and A is at position 3 (which we haven't tried). But what if the A is actually at position 1? Then we won't test that. So maybe ""ATONE"" -> but avoids N? We can't use N? Because we know N is not in the word? Actually, the feedback said N was not present? So N is absent.

 So we cannot use N. Therefore, ""ATONE"" is invalid because it has N.

 How about ""STAGE"": S T A G E -> A at position 3? Then we test S, T, G.

 That's also good.

 Another option: ""SLATE"" -> S L A T E -> A at position 3? S, L, T.

 I think ""SLATE"" is a common word.

 But note: the feedback says we have E at the end. So we know that. We don't need to change the E.

 However, in ""SLATE"": 
   Position 1: S -> not tested before.
   Position 2: L -> not tested.
   Position 3: A -> we know A is in the word, here it's placed in a new position (3). 
   Position 4: T -> not tested.
   Position 5: E -> already known.

 This word gives us information for S, L, T and checks A in position 3.

 Also, note: we don't use any forbidden letters (C, R, N).

 Alternatively, we can choose ""SAUCE"" -> but C is forbidden? We know C is not in the word? Actually, feedback said C(x). So avoid C.

 So ""SLATE"" seems good.

 What about ""PLATE""? P L A T E -> covers P, L, T. Also A at position 3.

 I don't see a strong preference. But let's go with ""SLATE"" because it uses more common letters? T is more common than P.

 Actually, yes. So we choose ""SLATE"".

 But wait: we have the possibility that A could be at position 1? But by putting it at position 3, if it gets marked as absent then we know it must be at position 4? Actually, no: the feedback will tell us for A if it's present and if so what position.

 Because the feedback per letter will tell us:

 - If A in SLATE (position 3) gets a ✓, then we know A is at position 3.
 - If A gets a '-', then we know A is present but not at 3 -> meaning it must be at position 1 or 4? 
 - But note: if A is at position 1 and we put it at position 3, it would be marked with a '-' meaning it's present elsewhere.

 So we can get information about the position of A.

 Similarly, by testing S, L, T we get information.

 So let's guess ""SLATE"".

After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **E(✓)** confirms that the secret word ends with `E`.
- **A(-)** means the letter `A` is in the word but not in position 2.
- **C(x)**, **R(x)**, and **N(x)** indicate these letters are not in the word.

For the second guess:
- The word must end with `E` (position 5).
- It must include `A` but avoid position 2 (since position 2 was incorrect for `A`).
- We cannot use `C`, `R`, or `N`.

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane""
 Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)

 Interpretation:
 - E is in the word and in the correct position (last letter). So the secret word ends with E.
 - A is in the word but not in the second position (since it's marked ""-"" meaning wrong position). So A is present, but elsewhere.
 - C, R, N are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word:
 - Must end with E: _ _ _ _ E
 - Contains the letter A, but not as the second letter (since in ""crane"", A was in position 2).
 - Does not contain C, R, N.

 Now, for the second guess, we want to:
 1. Try to place A in a different position (since it's not in position 2).
 2. Include other common letters that we haven't tried yet (excluding C, R, N).
 3. We know the last letter is E, so we keep that.

 Let's think of letters that are common and we haven't tried: 
 We have tried C, R, A, N, E. So avoid C, R, N. But we know A and E are present (E in the last spot, A somewhere else).

 We can use other vowels or common consonants: like S, T, L, I, O, B, D, G, H, K, M, P, U, etc.

 Also, we must avoid putting A in position 2 again (but it could be in position 1, 3, or 4).

 A good strategy is to use a word that has A in a new position (say position 1 or 3 or 4) and includes other new letters.

 Considering the feedback, the word must be of the form: [letter] [letter] [letter] [letter] E

 Since A is not in position 2, let's try putting A in position 1. Then the word would start with A.

 Also, we want to cover new letters. Let's try a word like ""ALIKE"", but note we haven't tried L, I, K.

 But wait: the last letter is E which we know. And we want to use the known E at the end.

 Potential word: ""ABUSE"" - but we don't know about B, U, S and it has A at position 1 and E at the end. However, note that in the first guess we had A at position 2 and it was present, so it's possible that A appears elsewhere and we don't know if it can be at start? Actually, we don't know yet. But we must not put A at position 2 because that was already tried and wrong position? Actually, the feedback only tells us that in the word ""crane"", A was in the word but not at the correct position. It might be that the correct position is position 1? We don't know until we try.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in a position we haven't tried: positions 1, 3, or 4.

 Let's list words that end with E and contain A and exclude C, R, N.

 Some options:

 - ""SAUTE"": S at start, A at position 2? But feedback told us that when A was in position 2 (in crane) it was present but wrong position. Now, if we put A in position 2 again? Actually, we can put A in position 2 again? But note: the feedback didn't say A cannot be in position 2, it said it is in the word but not in that position. So it could be that the word actually has A in a different position. However, if we put A in position 2 again and it still is not the correct position, then we know it must be placed elsewhere. But we want to maximize information. Maybe avoid position 2 for now until we test another position.

 So let's avoid position 2 for A for now.

 We can try:

 Position 1: A? => word pattern A _ _ _ E
 Examples: ABASE, ABATE, ADAGE, AGATE, ALATE, ALIKE, ALONE? (note: avoid N -> so no ALONE). 

 But note: we don't know if A is at position 1. It could be at position 3 or 4.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in position 3 or 4.

 Also, we need to include other new letters.

 Common letters: Let's try S, T, L, I, O, etc.

 After excluding C, R, N, we are left with many. What about:

 - ""PLATE"": P L A T E -> but we know E is at end? Yes. And A is at position 3? That's a new position. Also, we test P, L, T.

 However, note: the feedback for our first guess (crane) had A at position 2 being present but wrong. Now in ""PLATE"", A is at position 3. It might be that the correct position for A is 3? Not necessarily, it could be 1 or 4. But at least we test position 3.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"": S L A T E -> but that has A at position 3 again.

 But note: we don't know if S, L, T are in the word. We haven't tested them.

 Another idea: if we use a word with A at position 1, we can also test other common letters.

 Let me choose ""ADIEU"" but note: it ends with U, not E. We need E at the end.

 Wait, we must have E at the end. So we need a word that ends with E and has A and doesn't use C, R, N.

 Also, note we are not forced to include A. But we know A is in the word, so we should include it.

 Let me choose ""SAUTE"": S A U T E -> but that has A at position 2. We are unsure about position 2? We know from feedback that A is not in position 2? Actually, the feedback only says A is in the word but not at position 2. So it could be in the word at position 1, 3 or 4? However, note: the feedback does not preclude that position 2 might be A? Wait, no: if the secret word had A in position 2, then when we guessed ""crane"" with A in position 2, it would have been marked with a check. Since it was not, we know A is not in position 2. Therefore, we must avoid putting A in position 2? Or we can put it but we already know it's wrong? Actually, we can put it again to confirm? But that might be a waste. Better to test a different position.

 So let's choose a word with A in position 1: Examples:

 - ""ABASE"": A B A S E -> but note, repeated A. We haven't tested B and S. However, it's valid. But with repeated letters? We don't know if the word has repeated letters. It's possible.

 Feedback: we know A is in the word, but if the secret word has two A's? Our feedback for ""crane"" didn't indicate that. But note: when we guessed ""crane"", we only had one A and it was marked present. That doesn't rule out two A's.

 However, let's avoid repetition for now.

 Let me choose ""AGAPE"": but again two A's? 

 Or ""ADOBE"": no C,R,N? A D O B E -> O and B are new? And A at position 1? That's valid.

 But ""ADOBE"" ends with E? Yes.

 Alternatively, ""ALIKE"": A L I K E -> A at 1, and ends with E? Yes.

 Let's go with ""ALIKE"": we test A in position 1 and new letters L, I, K.

 But note: we know the word has E at the end and we have E in position 5 again? Actually, in feedback we already know E is at position 5. But guessing a word with E at position 5 again is fine because we can confirm and also test the rest.

 However, in position 1 we put A. We don't know if A should be at position 1 or not.

 Also, we are testing L, I, K.

 Alternatively, we can also try ""STALE"": S T A L E -> A at position 3? That's a new position. And S, T, L are new.

 Since we don't know where A is, testing position 3 is as good as position 1? Actually, we are testing two possibilities: position 1 and position 3. We can do either.

 I think ""STALE"" is a good candidate because S, T, L are common letters and A is at position 3 (which we haven't tried). But what if the A is actually at position 1? Then we won't test that. So maybe ""ATONE"" -> but avoids N? We can't use N? Because we know N is not in the word? Actually, the feedback said N was not present? So N is absent.

 So we cannot use N. Therefore, ""ATONE"" is invalid because it has N.

 How about ""STAGE"": S T A G E -> A at position 3? Then we test S, T, G.

 That's also good.

 Another option: ""SLATE"" -> S L A T E -> A at position 3? S, L, T.

 I think ""SLATE"" is a common word.

 But note: the feedback says we have E at the end. So we know that. We don't need to change the E.

 However, in ""SLATE"": 
   Position 1: S -> not tested before.
   Position 2: L -> not tested.
   Position 3: A -> we know A is in the word, here it's placed in a new position (3). 
   Position 4: T -> not tested.
   Position 5: E -> already known.

 This word gives us information for S, L, T and checks A in position 3.

 Also, note: we don't use any forbidden letters (C, R, N).

 Alternatively, we can choose ""SAUCE"" -> but C is forbidden? We know C is not in the word? Actually, feedback said C(x). So avoid C.

 So ""SLATE"" seems good.

 What about ""PLATE""? P L A T E -> covers P, L, T. Also A at position 3.

 I don't see a strong preference. But let's go with ""SLATE"" because it uses more common letters? T is more common than P.

 Actually, yes. So we choose ""SLATE"".

 But wait: we have the possibility that A could be at position 1? But by putting it at position 3, if it gets marked as absent then we know it must be at position 4? Actually, no: the feedback will tell us for A if it's present and if so what position.

 Because the feedback per letter will tell us:

 - If A in SLATE (position 3) gets a ✓, then we know A is at position 3.
 - If A gets a '-', then we know A is present but not at 3 -> meaning it must be at position 1 or 4? 
 - But note: if A is at position 1 and we put it at position 3, it would be marked with a '-' meaning it's present elsewhere.

 So we can get information about the position of A.

 Similarly, by testing S, L, T we get information.

 So let's guess ""SLATE"".

<guess>slate</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **E(✓)** confirms that the secret word ends with `E`.
- **A(-)** means the letter `A` is in the word but not in position 2.
- **C(x)**, **R(x)**, and **N(x)** indicate these letters are not in the word.

For the second guess:
- The word must end with `E` (position 5).
- It must include `A` but avoid position 2 (since position 2 was incorrect for `A`).
- We cannot use `C`, `R`, or `N`.
- New letters should be tested to gather more information, focusing on common consonants like `S`, `L`, and `T`.

I selected **slate** as the guess:
- Positions: `S` (test position 1), `L` (test position 2), `A` (test position 3, avoiding position 2), `T` (test position 4), `E` (confirmed position 5).
- This tests `A` in a new position (3) and introduces `S`, `L`, and `T`—frequent letters not yet evaluated.

We have two sets of feedback:

First guess: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
This tells us:
- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th).
- A is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
- C, R, N are not in the word.

Second guess: slate -> S(-) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(✓)
This tells us:
- E is again confirmed in the 5th position (we already knew this).
- S, L, A are all present but none of them are in the correct position in ""slate"".
  Specifically:
    S is not in position 1
    L is not in position 2
    A is not in position 3
- T is not in the word at all.

Additionally, we know:
- The word ends with E: ? ? ? ? E
- A is in the word, but not in positions 2 (from first guess) and not in position 3 (from second guess). Therefore, A must be in position 1 or 4.
- The absent letters are: C, R, N, T.
- Present letters: E (position 5), A, S, L. And we have tested A, S, L without knowing their exact positions.

Now, we need to form a new guess that:
- Does not contain C, R, N, T (eliminated).
- Must include S, L, A (because they are present) and of course E at the end.
- But note: we must not place S in position 1 (because slate had S in 1 and got a dash meaning incorrect position), L not in position 2, and A not in position 3.
- Also, since A can only be in position 1 or 4 (because positions 2 and 3 are now ruled out), we need to test A in one of these positions.

Possible positions for the known letters:
- Position 1: Could be A or S? But S was in position 1 and got a dash, meaning S is not in position 1, but it is in the word. So S might be in 2,3,4? Similarly, L is not in 2, and A is not in 2 or 3.

Since A must be in position 1 or 4, let's consider trying A in position 1 in this guess.

Also, we need to place S and L in positions where we have not ruled them out. For S: we tried position 1 and it was wrong -> S must be in 2,3 or 4? But wait, we have slot 2,3,4 available. Similarly L: we tried position 2 which was wrong, so L must be in 1,3,4 -> but position 1 might be taken by A? So we consider.

But note: in the second guess, slate had:
  pos1: S (not correct, but present) -> so S is in the word, just not at 1 -> thus S must be at 2,3, or 4.
  pos2: L (not correct, but present) -> L must be at 1,3, or 4.

However, if we try A at position 1, then we cannot put L at 1 (same position). Similarly, S cannot go to 1.

So the letters we must place: A, S, L and the last is E known. Plus we need one more letter.

The format: _ _ _ _ E

We are missing the 4th letter? Wait, we have four positions: 1,2,3,4. We know E is at 5.

We know the word has S, L, A, E and one more letter? Because so far we have found 4 letters: A, S, L, E? But our feedback only guaranteed A, S, L, E are present. However, we haven't tested all letters. There must be one more letter in position 3 or somewhere? Actually, the word has 5 letters. We only know 4: A, S, L, E? Or perhaps there are 5 distinct letters? The feedback doesn't rule out duplicates, but we haven't seen any duplicates. Let's proceed.

We need a fifth letter that is not C, R, N, T (because these are absent). And we don't know about other letters.

For the new guess, we must form a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (position 5).
- Contains A, S, L, and E (with E fixed at position 5).
- Does not contain C, R, N, T.
- And we must avoid putting A in position 2 or 3 (already tried) -> so only position 1 or 4 for A.
- Also avoid S in position 1 (because that was tried) -> S can only be in 2,3,4.
- Avoid L in position 2 -> L can be in 1,3,4.

But if we put A in position 1, then position 1 is occupied. Then S cannot be in 1? But we already avoid S in 1 so that's ok. Similarly, L cannot be in 1 because A is there? Then L must go to 3 or 4.

Similarly, if we put A in position 4, then position 4 is occupied.

Let's try to build with A in position 1:

So: A _ _ _ E

Now, we must assign S and L to positions 2,3,4? But without putting S at 1 (which we avoid) and L not in 2? So:

- Position 2: cannot put L (because L was in position 2 and got a dash? Actually, we know L is not at position 2). So we can put S in position 2? Because S could be at 2? Then L must be placed in position 3 or 4? And we have position 3 open?

Actually, the positions we have to assign to S: only 2,3,4? But we can put S in 2? Similarly L in 3 or 4? But note: the word must be valid.

Alternatively, A in position 4:

Then: _ _ _ A E

Now, assign S and L: S cannot be in 1? So S in position 2 or 3? L can be in position 1,3? But wait: position 1 is free? And L can be in position 1? Then we can have L at 1 and then S at 2 or 3? Also note: L was not tried in position 1? And S not tried in 2 or 3? So that's possible.

But we don't know which scenario (A at 1 or A at 4) is correct. We want to test A at 1? Then we should set A at 1 in this guess? Then we can get immediate feedback on A's position.

So let me try A in position 1.

Thus: A ? ? ? E

We need to assign S and L: and one more letter? Because we have three positions: 2,3,4.

The known letters we have to place: S and L. Then the fourth letter (for slot 2,3,4) must be an unknown letter? Actually, we have four letters: A, E, S, L. So the fifth letter is missing? Therefore the word has at least these four, but we need a fifth.

We have to choose one more letter (not C,R,N,T) and put it in one of the spots? And then assign S and L to the other two?

Also, we must not put S in position 1? But we are not putting S in 1 because we have A. Similarly L not in 2? So we can:

Option: put S in position 2? Then we must put L in position 3 or 4? And the remaining position (either 3 or 4) for a new letter.

But note: if we put S in 2, that's a new position? We don't know about position 2 for S? Similarly, L in 3: we haven't tried L in 3? Position 4? Also.

But we know L was tried in position 2 and was wrong? But we can try L in 3 or 4.

Similarly, we can avoid position 2 for L? That is, we know L cannot be at 2? So in this guess, we don't put L at 2? Which is okay.

Similarly, S cannot be at 1? But we are putting S at 2? So:

Position 1: A
Position 2: S? 
Position 3: ? 
Position 4: ? 
Position 5: E

And L must go to position 3 or 4? And the other position is a new letter.

But we must avoid any letter that we know is absent? Not just C,R,N,T? But we haven't tested many.

Alternatively, since A is at 1, and we need a word that works.

Common words: 
- Consider ""AISLE"": A I S L E -> E at end? Yes. 
But check: 
  Position 1: A -> we are testing A at 1? So it might be correct? 
  Position 2: I -> new letter.
  Position 3: S -> we haven't tried S in 3? 
  Position 4: L -> L in position 4? 
  Position 5: E.

And the letters: A,I,S,L,E. 
Absent letters we know: C,R,N,T -> I is not eliminated? Okay.

But note: feedback for A in the second guess was dash? But that's because it was at position 3? Now we are moving A to position 1? So it might be correct? We don't know.

But let's check if it violates any known restrictions:
- We don't put S in 1? Here S is at position 3? So okay.
- We don't put L in position 2? Here L is at position 4? Okay.
- A is at position 1? We hope to get feedback if it's correct.

But what about S? We have S in the word? Yes. And we are placing S at position 3? Which we haven't tried? 

But note: we have two possibilities for S: it might be at 2,3,4? We are testing 3.

Similarly, L: we are testing at position 4? And we haven't tried position 4 for L? 

Also, we are testing I? So getting I tested is good.

However, wait: the word ""AISLE""? We have previously tested A and we know it is present? But now we are putting A at position 1? If the secret word has A at 4? Then in this guess: A at position 1 would be marked as not correct (since it should be at 4)? I.e., a dash? So we learn.

But note: we also have to consider that there might be a duplicate? But let's try.

Another word with A at 1: ""ALOSE""? Is it valid? ALOSE? Not common. Better use ""ABUSE""? But we don't know B and we have U to test? But ""ABUSE"" uses B and U? And note: we must not use T (which we know is absent)? So B and U are possible.

But ""ABUSE"": A B U S E -> S is at position 4? Then L is missing? But our feedback says L is present? Oh wait: we know L is present? Because in ""slate"", L was at position 2 and marked dash? So L must be in the word? Therefore we must include L? Because when a letter gets a dash or check, it means it is in the word? Yes.

Therefore, we cannot ignore L? Our guess must include L? Because we know L is present? So guess must contain S, L, A, E (and one more letter).

So in ""AISLE"", we have: A, I, S, L, E -> so L is included? at position 4. So it's valid.

Similarly, what about ""ALL SE""? But repeated L? We don't know if duplicates? So let's try ""AISLE"".

But note: we have two scenarios:

If the secret word has A at position 1, then ""AISLE"" with A at 1 might be correct? But we don't know.

If the secret has A at position 4, then A at 1 in ""AISLE"" would be marked as not correct? And we would see dash for A? Then we learn A is at 4? But then we have L at 4? And if we put L at 4? Wait no: in ""AISLE"", A is at 1 and L at 4? So if A is actually at 4? Then L at 4 would be wrong? Actually, no: because A at 4, then L must be elsewhere? But we don't know.

Alternatively, let's consider: instead of testing A at 1, we test A at 4? Then we could learn more? 

Consider: A at position 4.

Then: _ _ _ A E

We must assign S and L? And one other letter? Without putting S at 1, L not at 2? And S not at 1? 

Options:

Position 1: can put L? Because L was at position 2 and wasn't correct? So we haven't tried L at 1? So let Position 1: L? Then Position 2: must not be L? So put S at 3? Position 3? Or put Position 2: S? But S hasn't been tried at position 2? 

But note: if we put L at 1: ? L ? ? E but the word is L ? ? A E

Then we can:

Position 1: L? 
Position 2: we can try a new letter? But S cannot be at 1? But we put L at 1? So S must be at position 3? Because if we put S at 2? Then S at position 2? We haven't tried S at 2. Similarly, position 3 is free? 

Also, we have position 3 and 2 available? 

What word: ""C ?"" ... but without C. 

Word like ""LEASE""? But has E in position 1? Actually, no: we are putting L at position 1? Then we need S somewhere? And A at 4.

""LEAVE""? L E A V E? But we don't know V? And also, A at 3? Then E? But E is already in position 5? And we have E at 2? But the word has two E's? Possible.

But note: ""LEAVE"" has E at position 2? And 5? And A at position 3? Then we have:

Positions: 1:L, 2:E, 3:A, 4:V, 5:E? But we know E is at 5? And we haven't tested V? But also, we are missing S? Because S must be in the word? But ""LEAVE"" has L,E,A,V,E? No S? We cannot skip S? So discard.

We need a word that includes S? So:

What about ""LOSES""? But fails: S repeated? And not starting? But we need L and A and S. And E at the end.

""LASED""? L A S E D? But E is at position 4? And we require E at 5? And we have to have E at 5? So not valid.

We need E at the end? So ? ? ? A E

With letters L, S, and one more? And E at the end? So the word must be: ? ? ? A E

Where we put L at 1? Then we need S? And another letter? And avoid T,C,R,N.

""LUCRE""? But C? Not allowed.

""LAPSE"": L A P S E -> but positions:
  1: L? 
  2: A? but we know A cannot be at position 2 (from first feedback)? Because ""crane"" had A at 2 and it got dash? Meaning A is in the word but not at position 2? So A at position 2 in this guess wouldn't be correct? Hence, we should avoid? 

But in ""lapse"", if we put A at 2? Then we are putting A in a known wrong position? That gives no new information? 

Actually, we cannot put A at 2? Because we know A is not at position 2? So the word must not have A at 2? But we are trying to put A at position 4? In this scenario. 

Wait, no: if we are testing A at position 4? Then in ""lapse"", A is at position 2? So we must not choose that.

So we want a word that has A at position 4? Then the pattern: ? ? ? A E

And we can put L at position 1? Then the next positions: 2 and 3: we assign one to S and another to a new letter? Without S at 1? And without L at 2? 

But position 2: what? We can put a new letter? Then position 3: S? And A at 4? 

Word: L ? S A E ? 

What can go in position 2? 

Examples: ""LIBRA""? But R? Absent? And not ending E? 

""LIASE""? Is that word? No.

""LEASE"": L E A S E? But A at position 3, not 4? Pattern: L E A S E -> then A at 3? And S at 4? And E at 5? But wait: we are trying to put A at 4? So wrong.

But we want A at position 4? So the word must have the fourth letter A? And then E at 5? And L at 1? Then position 2 and 3: can be S and a new letter? Or vice versa? 

Word: ? ? ? A E with L at 1:  L ? ? A E

Then position 2: we can put any that is not T,C,R,N? And S must be in the word? So we can put S at position 2: then L S ? A E -> what can be in position 3? It must be a letter? Words like: ""LYASE""? But not common.

""LASSO"" but ends O? No.

""LASED""? But E is not at 4? And we need E at end? So L ? ? A E -> that's five letters? So positions: L, x, y, A, E

What words: ""LUMPS""? doesn't have A? Not.

""LAPJE""? Not English.

""LATKE"" but T is absent? T is eliminated? 

Perhaps it's easier to test A at position 1? 

Therefore, I return to testing A at 1? And include L and S? And a new letter.

So pattern: A ? ? ? E

With S present? (must not be in 1? We put at 2,3,4) 
L present? (must not be in 2? We put at 3 or 4)

And we have to fill two positions? For example, put S at position 2? Then L at position 3? And what at 4? A new letter? 

Word: A S L ? E? Like ""ASLIE""? Not word.

Or A ? L ? E? With S at position 4: A ? L S E? 

Examples: ""ABULSE"" has extra letters.

Or ""AISLE"": A I S L E

Again: positions: A at1, I at2, S at3, L at4, E at5? 

Yes, ""aisle"" is a word and it meets:

- A at 1? Testing that.
- I is new? 
- S at 3? New position? 
- L at 4? New position? And E at5? known.
- Letters: so we test I? Which is good.

Alternatively ""AMBLE""? But M? And L at position 4? Similarly.

Another option: ""Apses""? But S repeated? And E at5? Not.

I think ""AISLE"" is a good candidate.

But we also consider ""ABASE"": A B A S E? Repeated A? Also not include L? But we must include L? So ignore.

Another: ""ALWAYS""? But Y? And no S? And not ends E? 

So better ""AISLE""

But what about ""AISLES""? Too long? 

No, we need 5-letter word: ""AISLE"" is 5.

So we go with ""AISLE"": 

  A in position 1 -> we see if it's correct? 
  I in position 2 -> check if new letter present?
  S in position 3 -> check correct?
  L in position 4 -> check correct?
  E in position 5 -> known.

And avoid C,R,N,T? Yes, ""AISLE"" doesn't have any of these.

So let's guess ""AISLE""

<guess>aisle</guess>

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:

#### From Guess 1 (""crane""):
- **C**: ❌ (not in word)
- **R**: ❌ (not in word)
- **A**: ➖ (in word, but not position 2)
- **N**: ❌ (not in word)
- **E**: ✓ (correct position: position 5)

#### From Guess 2 (""slate""):
- **S**: ➖ (in word, but not position 1)
- **L**: ➖ (in word, but not position 2)
- **A**: ➖ (in word, but not position 3)
- **T**: ❌ (not in word)
- **E**: ✓ (confirmed position 5)

#### Key Deductions:
1. The word ends with **E** (position 5).
2. **A**, **S**, and **L** are in the word, but:
   - **A** is not in positions 2 or 3 (eliminated).
   - **S** is not in position 1 (eliminated).
   - **L** is not in position 2 (eliminated).
3. Absent letters: **C**, **R**, **N**, **T** (cannot be used).
4. **A** must be in position 1 or 4 (only remaining positions).
5. **S** must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
6. **L** must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

For this guess:
- Test **A** at position 1 (since position 4 remains untested and could be validated later).
- Place **S** and **L** in new positions to maximize information:
  - **S** cannot be in position 1→ placed at position 3.
  - **L** cannot be in position 2→ placed at position 4.
- Introduce a new letter **I** at position 2 to test for presence.
- Structure: **A** (position 1), **I** (position 2), **S** (position 3), **L** (position 4), **E** (position 5).

The word **aisle** fits all constraints:
- Contains **A**, **S**, **L**, and **E**.
- Avoids forbidden letters (**C**, **R**, **N**, **T**).
- Tests **A** at position 1 and new positions for **S** and **L**.

<guess>aisle</guess>",aisle,"We have two sets of feedback:

First guess: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
This tells us:
- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th).
- A is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
- C, R, N are not in the word.

Second guess: slate -> S(-) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(✓)
This tells us:
- E is again confirmed in the 5th position (we already knew this).
- S, L, A are all present but none of them are in the correct position in ""slate"".
  Specifically:
    S is not in position 1
    L is not in position 2
    A is not in position 3
- T is not in the word at all.

Additionally, we know:
- The word ends with E: ? ? ? ? E
- A is in the word, but not in positions 2 (from first guess) and not in position 3 (from second guess). Therefore, A must be in position 1 or 4.
- The absent letters are: C, R, N, T.
- Present letters: E (position 5), A, S, L. And we have tested A, S, L without knowing their exact positions.

Now, we need to form a new guess that:
- Does not contain C, R, N, T (eliminated).
- Must include S, L, A (because they are present) and of course E at the end.
- But note: we must not place S in position 1 (because slate had S in 1 and got a dash meaning incorrect position), L not in position 2, and A not in position 3.
- Also, since A can only be in position 1 or 4 (because positions 2 and 3 are now ruled out), we need to test A in one of these positions.

Possible positions for the known letters:
- Position 1: Could be A or S? But S was in position 1 and got a dash, meaning S is not in position 1, but it is in the word. So S might be in 2,3,4? Similarly, L is not in 2, and A is not in 2 or 3.

Since A must be in position 1 or 4, let's consider trying A in position 1 in this guess.

Also, we need to place S and L in positions where we have not ruled them out. For S: we tried position 1 and it was wrong -> S must be in 2,3 or 4? But wait, we have slot 2,3,4 available. Similarly L: we tried position 2 which was wrong, so L must be in 1,3,4 -> but position 1 might be taken by A? So we consider.

But note: in the second guess, slate had:
  pos1: S (not correct, but present) -> so S is in the word, just not at 1 -> thus S must be at 2,3, or 4.
  pos2: L (not correct, but present) -> L must be at 1,3, or 4.

However, if we try A at position 1, then we cannot put L at 1 (same position). Similarly, S cannot go to 1.

So the letters we must place: A, S, L and the last is E known. Plus we need one more letter.

The format: _ _ _ _ E

We are missing the 4th letter? Wait, we have four positions: 1,2,3,4. We know E is at 5.

We know the word has S, L, A, E and one more letter? Because so far we have found 4 letters: A, S, L, E? But our feedback only guaranteed A, S, L, E are present. However, we haven't tested all letters. There must be one more letter in position 3 or somewhere? Actually, the word has 5 letters. We only know 4: A, S, L, E? Or perhaps there are 5 distinct letters? The feedback doesn't rule out duplicates, but we haven't seen any duplicates. Let's proceed.

We need a fifth letter that is not C, R, N, T (because these are absent). And we don't know about other letters.

For the new guess, we must form a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (position 5).
- Contains A, S, L, and E (with E fixed at position 5).
- Does not contain C, R, N, T.
- And we must avoid putting A in position 2 or 3 (already tried) -> so only position 1 or 4 for A.
- Also avoid S in position 1 (because that was tried) -> S can only be in 2,3,4.
- Avoid L in position 2 -> L can be in 1,3,4.

But if we put A in position 1, then position 1 is occupied. Then S cannot be in 1? But we already avoid S in 1 so that's ok. Similarly, L cannot be in 1 because A is there? Then L must go to 3 or 4.

Similarly, if we put A in position 4, then position 4 is occupied.

Let's try to build with A in position 1:

So: A _ _ _ E

Now, we must assign S and L to positions 2,3,4? But without putting S at 1 (which we avoid) and L not in 2? So:

- Position 2: cannot put L (because L was in position 2 and got a dash? Actually, we know L is not at position 2). So we can put S in position 2? Because S could be at 2? Then L must be placed in position 3 or 4? And we have position 3 open?

Actually, the positions we have to assign to S: only 2,3,4? But we can put S in 2? Similarly L in 3 or 4? But note: the word must be valid.

Alternatively, A in position 4:

Then: _ _ _ A E

Now, assign S and L: S cannot be in 1? So S in position 2 or 3? L can be in position 1,3? But wait: position 1 is free? And L can be in position 1? Then we can have L at 1 and then S at 2 or 3? Also note: L was not tried in position 1? And S not tried in 2 or 3? So that's possible.

But we don't know which scenario (A at 1 or A at 4) is correct. We want to test A at 1? Then we should set A at 1 in this guess? Then we can get immediate feedback on A's position.

So let me try A in position 1.

Thus: A ? ? ? E

We need to assign S and L: and one more letter? Because we have three positions: 2,3,4.

The known letters we have to place: S and L. Then the fourth letter (for slot 2,3,4) must be an unknown letter? Actually, we have four letters: A, E, S, L. So the fifth letter is missing? Therefore the word has at least these four, but we need a fifth.

We have to choose one more letter (not C,R,N,T) and put it in one of the spots? And then assign S and L to the other two?

Also, we must not put S in position 1? But we are not putting S in 1 because we have A. Similarly L not in 2? So we can:

Option: put S in position 2? Then we must put L in position 3 or 4? And the remaining position (either 3 or 4) for a new letter.

But note: if we put S in 2, that's a new position? We don't know about position 2 for S? Similarly, L in 3: we haven't tried L in 3? Position 4? Also.

But we know L was tried in position 2 and was wrong? But we can try L in 3 or 4.

Similarly, we can avoid position 2 for L? That is, we know L cannot be at 2? So in this guess, we don't put L at 2? Which is okay.

Similarly, S cannot be at 1? But we are putting S at 2? So:

Position 1: A
Position 2: S? 
Position 3: ? 
Position 4: ? 
Position 5: E

And L must go to position 3 or 4? And the other position is a new letter.

But we must avoid any letter that we know is absent? Not just C,R,N,T? But we haven't tested many.

Alternatively, since A is at 1, and we need a word that works.

Common words: 
- Consider ""AISLE"": A I S L E -> E at end? Yes. 
But check: 
  Position 1: A -> we are testing A at 1? So it might be correct? 
  Position 2: I -> new letter.
  Position 3: S -> we haven't tried S in 3? 
  Position 4: L -> L in position 4? 
  Position 5: E.

And the letters: A,I,S,L,E. 
Absent letters we know: C,R,N,T -> I is not eliminated? Okay.

But note: feedback for A in the second guess was dash? But that's because it was at position 3? Now we are moving A to position 1? So it might be correct? We don't know.

But let's check if it violates any known restrictions:
- We don't put S in 1? Here S is at position 3? So okay.
- We don't put L in position 2? Here L is at position 4? Okay.
- A is at position 1? We hope to get feedback if it's correct.

But what about S? We have S in the word? Yes. And we are placing S at position 3? Which we haven't tried? 

But note: we have two possibilities for S: it might be at 2,3,4? We are testing 3.

Similarly, L: we are testing at position 4? And we haven't tried position 4 for L? 

Also, we are testing I? So getting I tested is good.

However, wait: the word ""AISLE""? We have previously tested A and we know it is present? But now we are putting A at position 1? If the secret word has A at 4? Then in this guess: A at position 1 would be marked as not correct (since it should be at 4)? I.e., a dash? So we learn.

But note: we also have to consider that there might be a duplicate? But let's try.

Another word with A at 1: ""ALOSE""? Is it valid? ALOSE? Not common. Better use ""ABUSE""? But we don't know B and we have U to test? But ""ABUSE"" uses B and U? And note: we must not use T (which we know is absent)? So B and U are possible.

But ""ABUSE"": A B U S E -> S is at position 4? Then L is missing? But our feedback says L is present? Oh wait: we know L is present? Because in ""slate"", L was at position 2 and marked dash? So L must be in the word? Therefore we must include L? Because when a letter gets a dash or check, it means it is in the word? Yes.

Therefore, we cannot ignore L? Our guess must include L? Because we know L is present? So guess must contain S, L, A, E (and one more letter).

So in ""AISLE"", we have: A, I, S, L, E -> so L is included? at position 4. So it's valid.

Similarly, what about ""ALL SE""? But repeated L? We don't know if duplicates? So let's try ""AISLE"".

But note: we have two scenarios:

If the secret word has A at position 1, then ""AISLE"" with A at 1 might be correct? But we don't know.

If the secret has A at position 4, then A at 1 in ""AISLE"" would be marked as not correct? And we would see dash for A? Then we learn A is at 4? But then we have L at 4? And if we put L at 4? Wait no: in ""AISLE"", A is at 1 and L at 4? So if A is actually at 4? Then L at 4 would be wrong? Actually, no: because A at 4, then L must be elsewhere? But we don't know.

Alternatively, let's consider: instead of testing A at 1, we test A at 4? Then we could learn more? 

Consider: A at position 4.

Then: _ _ _ A E

We must assign S and L? And one other letter? Without putting S at 1, L not at 2? And S not at 1? 

Options:

Position 1: can put L? Because L was at position 2 and wasn't correct? So we haven't tried L at 1? So let Position 1: L? Then Position 2: must not be L? So put S at 3? Position 3? Or put Position 2: S? But S hasn't been tried at position 2? 

But note: if we put L at 1: ? L ? ? E but the word is L ? ? A E

Then we can:

Position 1: L? 
Position 2: we can try a new letter? But S cannot be at 1? But we put L at 1? So S must be at position 3? Because if we put S at 2? Then S at position 2? We haven't tried S at 2. Similarly, position 3 is free? 

Also, we have position 3 and 2 available? 

What word: ""C ?"" ... but without C. 

Word like ""LEASE""? But has E in position 1? Actually, no: we are putting L at position 1? Then we need S somewhere? And A at 4.

""LEAVE""? L E A V E? But we don't know V? And also, A at 3? Then E? But E is already in position 5? And we have E at 2? But the word has two E's? Possible.

But note: ""LEAVE"" has E at position 2? And 5? And A at position 3? Then we have:

Positions: 1:L, 2:E, 3:A, 4:V, 5:E? But we know E is at 5? And we haven't tested V? But also, we are missing S? Because S must be in the word? But ""LEAVE"" has L,E,A,V,E? No S? We cannot skip S? So discard.

We need a word that includes S? So:

What about ""LOSES""? But fails: S repeated? And not starting? But we need L and A and S. And E at the end.

""LASED""? L A S E D? But E is at position 4? And we require E at 5? And we have to have E at 5? So not valid.

We need E at the end? So ? ? ? A E

With letters L, S, and one more? And E at the end? So the word must be: ? ? ? A E

Where we put L at 1? Then we need S? And another letter? And avoid T,C,R,N.

""LUCRE""? But C? Not allowed.

""LAPSE"": L A P S E -> but positions:
  1: L? 
  2: A? but we know A cannot be at position 2 (from first feedback)? Because ""crane"" had A at 2 and it got dash? Meaning A is in the word but not at position 2? So A at position 2 in this guess wouldn't be correct? Hence, we should avoid? 

But in ""lapse"", if we put A at 2? Then we are putting A in a known wrong position? That gives no new information? 

Actually, we cannot put A at 2? Because we know A is not at position 2? So the word must not have A at 2? But we are trying to put A at position 4? In this scenario. 

Wait, no: if we are testing A at position 4? Then in ""lapse"", A is at position 2? So we must not choose that.

So we want a word that has A at position 4? Then the pattern: ? ? ? A E

And we can put L at position 1? Then the next positions: 2 and 3: we assign one to S and another to a new letter? Without S at 1? And without L at 2? 

But position 2: what? We can put a new letter? Then position 3: S? And A at 4? 

Word: L ? S A E ? 

What can go in position 2? 

Examples: ""LIBRA""? But R? Absent? And not ending E? 

""LIASE""? Is that word? No.

""LEASE"": L E A S E? But A at position 3, not 4? Pattern: L E A S E -> then A at 3? And S at 4? And E at 5? But wait: we are trying to put A at 4? So wrong.

But we want A at position 4? So the word must have the fourth letter A? And then E at 5? And L at 1? Then position 2 and 3: can be S and a new letter? Or vice versa? 

Word: ? ? ? A E with L at 1:  L ? ? A E

Then position 2: we can put any that is not T,C,R,N? And S must be in the word? So we can put S at position 2: then L S ? A E -> what can be in position 3? It must be a letter? Words like: ""LYASE""? But not common.

""LASSO"" but ends O? No.

""LASED""? But E is not at 4? And we need E at end? So L ? ? A E -> that's five letters? So positions: L, x, y, A, E

What words: ""LUMPS""? doesn't have A? Not.

""LAPJE""? Not English.

""LATKE"" but T is absent? T is eliminated? 

Perhaps it's easier to test A at position 1? 

Therefore, I return to testing A at 1? And include L and S? And a new letter.

So pattern: A ? ? ? E

With S present? (must not be in 1? We put at 2,3,4) 
L present? (must not be in 2? We put at 3 or 4)

And we have to fill two positions? For example, put S at position 2? Then L at position 3? And what at 4? A new letter? 

Word: A S L ? E? Like ""ASLIE""? Not word.

Or A ? L ? E? With S at position 4: A ? L S E? 

Examples: ""ABULSE"" has extra letters.

Or ""AISLE"": A I S L E

Again: positions: A at1, I at2, S at3, L at4, E at5? 

Yes, ""aisle"" is a word and it meets:

- A at 1? Testing that.
- I is new? 
- S at 3? New position? 
- L at 4? New position? And E at5? known.
- Letters: so we test I? Which is good.

Alternatively ""AMBLE""? But M? And L at position 4? Similarly.

Another option: ""Apses""? But S repeated? And E at5? Not.

I think ""AISLE"" is a good candidate.

But we also consider ""ABASE"": A B A S E? Repeated A? Also not include L? But we must include L? So ignore.

Another: ""ALWAYS""? But Y? And no S? And not ends E? 

So better ""AISLE""

But what about ""AISLES""? Too long? 

No, we need 5-letter word: ""AISLE"" is 5.

So we go with ""AISLE"": 

  A in position 1 -> we see if it's correct? 
  I in position 2 -> check if new letter present?
  S in position 3 -> check correct?
  L in position 4 -> check correct?
  E in position 5 -> known.

And avoid C,R,N,T? Yes, ""AISLE"" doesn't have any of these.

So let's guess ""AISLE""

<guess>aisle</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:

#### From Guess 1 (""crane""):
- **C**: ❌ (not in word)
- **R**: ❌ (not in word)
- **A**: ➖ (in word, but not position 2)
- **N**: ❌ (not in word)
- **E**: ✓ (correct position: position 5)

#### From Guess 2 (""slate""):
- **S**: ➖ (in word, but not position 1)
- **L**: ➖ (in word, but not position 2)
- **A**: ➖ (in word, but not position 3)
- **T**: ❌ (not in word)
- **E**: ✓ (confirmed position 5)

#### Key Deductions:
1. The word ends with **E** (position 5).
2. **A**, **S**, and **L** are in the word, but:
   - **A** is not in positions 2 or 3 (eliminated).
   - **S** is not in position 1 (eliminated).
   - **L** is not in position 2 (eliminated).
3. Absent letters: **C**, **R**, **N**, **T** (cannot be used).
4. **A** must be in position 1 or 4 (only remaining positions).
5. **S** must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
6. **L** must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

For this guess:
- Test **A** at position 1 (since position 4 remains untested and could be validated later).
- Place **S** and **L** in new positions to maximize information:
  - **S** cannot be in position 1→ placed at position 3.
  - **L** cannot be in position 2→ placed at position 4.
- Introduce a new letter **I** at position 2 to test for presence.
- Structure: **A** (position 1), **I** (position 2), **S** (position 3), **L** (position 4), **E** (position 5).

The word **aisle** fits all constraints:
- Contains **A**, **S**, **L**, and **E**.
- Avoids forbidden letters (**C**, **R**, **N**, **T**).
- Tests **A** at position 1 and new positions for **S** and **L**.",Guess 3: aisle -> FEEDBACK: A(-) I(x) S(-) L(-) E(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,false,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane""
 Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)

 Interpretation:
 - E is in the word and in the correct position (last letter). So the secret word ends with E.
 - A is in the word but not in the second position (since it's marked ""-"" meaning wrong position). So A is present, but elsewhere.
 - C, R, N are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word:
 - Must end with E: _ _ _ _ E
 - Contains the letter A, but not as the second letter (since in ""crane"", A was in position 2).
 - Does not contain C, R, N.

 Now, for the second guess, we want to:
 1. Try to place A in a different position (since it's not in position 2).
 2. Include other common letters that we haven't tried yet (excluding C, R, N).
 3. We know the last letter is E, so we keep that.

 Let's think of letters that are common and we haven't tried: 
 We have tried C, R, A, N, E. So avoid C, R, N. But we know A and E are present (E in the last spot, A somewhere else).

 We can use other vowels or common consonants: like S, T, L, I, O, B, D, G, H, K, M, P, U, etc.

 Also, we must avoid putting A in position 2 again (but it could be in position 1, 3, or 4).

 A good strategy is to use a word that has A in a new position (say position 1 or 3 or 4) and includes other new letters.

 Considering the feedback, the word must be of the form: [letter] [letter] [letter] [letter] E

 Since A is not in position 2, let's try putting A in position 1. Then the word would start with A.

 Also, we want to cover new letters. Let's try a word like ""ALIKE"", but note we haven't tried L, I, K.

 But wait: the last letter is E which we know. And we want to use the known E at the end.

 Potential word: ""ABUSE"" - but we don't know about B, U, S and it has A at position 1 and E at the end. However, note that in the first guess we had A at position 2 and it was present, so it's possible that A appears elsewhere and we don't know if it can be at start? Actually, we don't know yet. But we must not put A at position 2 because that was already tried and wrong position? Actually, the feedback only tells us that in the word ""crane"", A was in the word but not at the correct position. It might be that the correct position is position 1? We don't know until we try.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in a position we haven't tried: positions 1, 3, or 4.

 Let's list words that end with E and contain A and exclude C, R, N.

 Some options:

 - ""SAUTE"": S at start, A at position 2? But feedback told us that when A was in position 2 (in crane) it was present but wrong position. Now, if we put A in position 2 again? Actually, we can put A in position 2 again? But note: the feedback didn't say A cannot be in position 2, it said it is in the word but not in that position. So it could be that the word actually has A in a different position. However, if we put A in position 2 again and it still is not the correct position, then we know it must be placed elsewhere. But we want to maximize information. Maybe avoid position 2 for now until we test another position.

 So let's avoid position 2 for A for now.

 We can try:

 Position 1: A? => word pattern A _ _ _ E
 Examples: ABASE, ABATE, ADAGE, AGATE, ALATE, ALIKE, ALONE? (note: avoid N -> so no ALONE). 

 But note: we don't know if A is at position 1. It could be at position 3 or 4.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in position 3 or 4.

 Also, we need to include other new letters.

 Common letters: Let's try S, T, L, I, O, etc.

 After excluding C, R, N, we are left with many. What about:

 - ""PLATE"": P L A T E -> but we know E is at end? Yes. And A is at position 3? That's a new position. Also, we test P, L, T.

 However, note: the feedback for our first guess (crane) had A at position 2 being present but wrong. Now in ""PLATE"", A is at position 3. It might be that the correct position for A is 3? Not necessarily, it could be 1 or 4. But at least we test position 3.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"": S L A T E -> but that has A at position 3 again.

 But note: we don't know if S, L, T are in the word. We haven't tested them.

 Another idea: if we use a word with A at position 1, we can also test other common letters.

 Let me choose ""ADIEU"" but note: it ends with U, not E. We need E at the end.

 Wait, we must have E at the end. So we need a word that ends with E and has A and doesn't use C, R, N.

 Also, note we are not forced to include A. But we know A is in the word, so we should include it.

 Let me choose ""SAUTE"": S A U T E -> but that has A at position 2. We are unsure about position 2? We know from feedback that A is not in position 2? Actually, the feedback only says A is in the word but not at position 2. So it could be in the word at position 1, 3 or 4? However, note: the feedback does not preclude that position 2 might be A? Wait, no: if the secret word had A in position 2, then when we guessed ""crane"" with A in position 2, it would have been marked with a check. Since it was not, we know A is not in position 2. Therefore, we must avoid putting A in position 2? Or we can put it but we already know it's wrong? Actually, we can put it again to confirm? But that might be a waste. Better to test a different position.

 So let's choose a word with A in position 1: Examples:

 - ""ABASE"": A B A S E -> but note, repeated A. We haven't tested B and S. However, it's valid. But with repeated letters? We don't know if the word has repeated letters. It's possible.

 Feedback: we know A is in the word, but if the secret word has two A's? Our feedback for ""crane"" didn't indicate that. But note: when we guessed ""crane"", we only had one A and it was marked present. That doesn't rule out two A's.

 However, let's avoid repetition for now.

 Let me choose ""AGAPE"": but again two A's? 

 Or ""ADOBE"": no C,R,N? A D O B E -> O and B are new? And A at position 1? That's valid.

 But ""ADOBE"" ends with E? Yes.

 Alternatively, ""ALIKE"": A L I K E -> A at 1, and ends with E? Yes.

 Let's go with ""ALIKE"": we test A in position 1 and new letters L, I, K.

 But note: we know the word has E at the end and we have E in position 5 again? Actually, in feedback we already know E is at position 5. But guessing a word with E at position 5 again is fine because we can confirm and also test the rest.

 However, in position 1 we put A. We don't know if A should be at position 1 or not.

 Also, we are testing L, I, K.

 Alternatively, we can also try ""STALE"": S T A L E -> A at position 3? That's a new position. And S, T, L are new.

 Since we don't know where A is, testing position 3 is as good as position 1? Actually, we are testing two possibilities: position 1 and position 3. We can do either.

 I think ""STALE"" is a good candidate because S, T, L are common letters and A is at position 3 (which we haven't tried). But what if the A is actually at position 1? Then we won't test that. So maybe ""ATONE"" -> but avoids N? We can't use N? Because we know N is not in the word? Actually, the feedback said N was not present? So N is absent.

 So we cannot use N. Therefore, ""ATONE"" is invalid because it has N.

 How about ""STAGE"": S T A G E -> A at position 3? Then we test S, T, G.

 That's also good.

 Another option: ""SLATE"" -> S L A T E -> A at position 3? S, L, T.

 I think ""SLATE"" is a common word.

 But note: the feedback says we have E at the end. So we know that. We don't need to change the E.

 However, in ""SLATE"": 
   Position 1: S -> not tested before.
   Position 2: L -> not tested.
   Position 3: A -> we know A is in the word, here it's placed in a new position (3). 
   Position 4: T -> not tested.
   Position 5: E -> already known.

 This word gives us information for S, L, T and checks A in position 3.

 Also, note: we don't use any forbidden letters (C, R, N).

 Alternatively, we can choose ""SAUCE"" -> but C is forbidden? We know C is not in the word? Actually, feedback said C(x). So avoid C.

 So ""SLATE"" seems good.

 What about ""PLATE""? P L A T E -> covers P, L, T. Also A at position 3.

 I don't see a strong preference. But let's go with ""SLATE"" because it uses more common letters? T is more common than P.

 Actually, yes. So we choose ""SLATE"".

 But wait: we have the possibility that A could be at position 1? But by putting it at position 3, if it gets marked as absent then we know it must be at position 4? Actually, no: the feedback will tell us for A if it's present and if so what position.

 Because the feedback per letter will tell us:

 - If A in SLATE (position 3) gets a ✓, then we know A is at position 3.
 - If A gets a '-', then we know A is present but not at 3 -> meaning it must be at position 1 or 4? 
 - But note: if A is at position 1 and we put it at position 3, it would be marked with a '-' meaning it's present elsewhere.

 So we can get information about the position of A.

 Similarly, by testing S, L, T we get information.

 So let's guess ""SLATE"".

<guess>slate</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **E(✓)** confirms that the secret word ends with `E`.
- **A(-)** means the letter `A` is in the word but not in position 2.
- **C(x)**, **R(x)**, and **N(x)** indicate these letters are not in the word.

For the second guess:
- The word must end with `E` (position 5).
- It must include `A` but avoid position 2 (since position 2 was incorrect for `A`).
- We cannot use `C`, `R`, or `N`.
- New letters should be tested to gather more information, focusing on common consonants like `S`, `L`, and `T`.

I selected **slate** as the guess:
- Positions: `S` (test position 1), `L` (test position 2), `A` (test position 3, avoiding position 2), `T` (test position 4), `E` (confirmed position 5).
- This tests `A` in a new position (3) and introduces `S`, `L`, and `T`—frequent letters not yet evaluated.

<guess>slate</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two sets of feedback:

First guess: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
This tells us:
- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th).
- A is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
- C, R, N are not in the word.

Second guess: slate -> S(-) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(✓)
This tells us:
- E is again confirmed in the 5th position (we already knew this).
- S, L, A are all present but none of them are in the correct position in ""slate"".
  Specifically:
    S is not in position 1
    L is not in position 2
    A is not in position 3
- T is not in the word at all.

Additionally, we know:
- The word ends with E: ? ? ? ? E
- A is in the word, but not in positions 2 (from first guess) and not in position 3 (from second guess). Therefore, A must be in position 1 or 4.
- The absent letters are: C, R, N, T.
- Present letters: E (position 5), A, S, L. And we have tested A, S, L without knowing their exact positions.

Now, we need to form a new guess that:
- Does not contain C, R, N, T (eliminated).
- Must include S, L, A (because they are present) and of course E at the end.
- But note: we must not place S in position 1 (because slate had S in 1 and got a dash meaning incorrect position), L not in position 2, and A not in position 3.
- Also, since A can only be in position 1 or 4 (because positions 2 and 3 are now ruled out), we need to test A in one of these positions.

Possible positions for the known letters:
- Position 1: Could be A or S? But S was in position 1 and got a dash, meaning S is not in position 1, but it is in the word. So S might be in 2,3,4? Similarly, L is not in 2, and A is not in 2 or 3.

Since A must be in position 1 or 4, let's consider trying A in position 1 in this guess.

Also, we need to place S and L in positions where we have not ruled them out. For S: we tried position 1 and it was wrong -> S must be in 2,3 or 4? But wait, we have slot 2,3,4 available. Similarly L: we tried position 2 which was wrong, so L must be in 1,3,4 -> but position 1 might be taken by A? So we consider.

But note: in the second guess, slate had:
  pos1: S (not correct, but present) -> so S is in the word, just not at 1 -> thus S must be at 2,3, or 4.
  pos2: L (not correct, but present) -> L must be at 1,3, or 4.

However, if we try A at position 1, then we cannot put L at 1 (same position). Similarly, S cannot go to 1.

So the letters we must place: A, S, L and the last is E known. Plus we need one more letter.

The format: _ _ _ _ E

We are missing the 4th letter? Wait, we have four positions: 1,2,3,4. We know E is at 5.

We know the word has S, L, A, E and one more letter? Because so far we have found 4 letters: A, S, L, E? But our feedback only guaranteed A, S, L, E are present. However, we haven't tested all letters. There must be one more letter in position 3 or somewhere? Actually, the word has 5 letters. We only know 4: A, S, L, E? Or perhaps there are 5 distinct letters? The feedback doesn't rule out duplicates, but we haven't seen any duplicates. Let's proceed.

We need a fifth letter that is not C, R, N, T (because these are absent). And we don't know about other letters.

For the new guess, we must form a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (position 5).
- Contains A, S, L, and E (with E fixed at position 5).
- Does not contain C, R, N, T.
- And we must avoid putting A in position 2 or 3 (already tried) -> so only position 1 or 4 for A.
- Also avoid S in position 1 (because that was tried) -> S can only be in 2,3,4.
- Avoid L in position 2 -> L can be in 1,3,4.

But if we put A in position 1, then position 1 is occupied. Then S cannot be in 1? But we already avoid S in 1 so that's ok. Similarly, L cannot be in 1 because A is there? Then L must go to 3 or 4.

Similarly, if we put A in position 4, then position 4 is occupied.

Let's try to build with A in position 1:

So: A _ _ _ E

Now, we must assign S and L to positions 2,3,4? But without putting S at 1 (which we avoid) and L not in 2? So:

- Position 2: cannot put L (because L was in position 2 and got a dash? Actually, we know L is not at position 2). So we can put S in position 2? Because S could be at 2? Then L must be placed in position 3 or 4? And we have position 3 open?

Actually, the positions we have to assign to S: only 2,3,4? But we can put S in 2? Similarly L in 3 or 4? But note: the word must be valid.

Alternatively, A in position 4:

Then: _ _ _ A E

Now, assign S and L: S cannot be in 1? So S in position 2 or 3? L can be in position 1,3? But wait: position 1 is free? And L can be in position 1? Then we can have L at 1 and then S at 2 or 3? Also note: L was not tried in position 1? And S not tried in 2 or 3? So that's possible.

But we don't know which scenario (A at 1 or A at 4) is correct. We want to test A at 1? Then we should set A at 1 in this guess? Then we can get immediate feedback on A's position.

So let me try A in position 1.

Thus: A ? ? ? E

We need to assign S and L: and one more letter? Because we have three positions: 2,3,4.

The known letters we have to place: S and L. Then the fourth letter (for slot 2,3,4) must be an unknown letter? Actually, we have four letters: A, E, S, L. So the fifth letter is missing? Therefore the word has at least these four, but we need a fifth.

We have to choose one more letter (not C,R,N,T) and put it in one of the spots? And then assign S and L to the other two?

Also, we must not put S in position 1? But we are not putting S in 1 because we have A. Similarly L not in 2? So we can:

Option: put S in position 2? Then we must put L in position 3 or 4? And the remaining position (either 3 or 4) for a new letter.

But note: if we put S in 2, that's a new position? We don't know about position 2 for S? Similarly, L in 3: we haven't tried L in 3? Position 4? Also.

But we know L was tried in position 2 and was wrong? But we can try L in 3 or 4.

Similarly, we can avoid position 2 for L? That is, we know L cannot be at 2? So in this guess, we don't put L at 2? Which is okay.

Similarly, S cannot be at 1? But we are putting S at 2? So:

Position 1: A
Position 2: S? 
Position 3: ? 
Position 4: ? 
Position 5: E

And L must go to position 3 or 4? And the other position is a new letter.

But we must avoid any letter that we know is absent? Not just C,R,N,T? But we haven't tested many.

Alternatively, since A is at 1, and we need a word that works.

Common words: 
- Consider ""AISLE"": A I S L E -> E at end? Yes. 
But check: 
  Position 1: A -> we are testing A at 1? So it might be correct? 
  Position 2: I -> new letter.
  Position 3: S -> we haven't tried S in 3? 
  Position 4: L -> L in position 4? 
  Position 5: E.

And the letters: A,I,S,L,E. 
Absent letters we know: C,R,N,T -> I is not eliminated? Okay.

But note: feedback for A in the second guess was dash? But that's because it was at position 3? Now we are moving A to position 1? So it might be correct? We don't know.

But let's check if it violates any known restrictions:
- We don't put S in 1? Here S is at position 3? So okay.
- We don't put L in position 2? Here L is at position 4? Okay.
- A is at position 1? We hope to get feedback if it's correct.

But what about S? We have S in the word? Yes. And we are placing S at position 3? Which we haven't tried? 

But note: we have two possibilities for S: it might be at 2,3,4? We are testing 3.

Similarly, L: we are testing at position 4? And we haven't tried position 4 for L? 

Also, we are testing I? So getting I tested is good.

However, wait: the word ""AISLE""? We have previously tested A and we know it is present? But now we are putting A at position 1? If the secret word has A at 4? Then in this guess: A at position 1 would be marked as not correct (since it should be at 4)? I.e., a dash? So we learn.

But note: we also have to consider that there might be a duplicate? But let's try.

Another word with A at 1: ""ALOSE""? Is it valid? ALOSE? Not common. Better use ""ABUSE""? But we don't know B and we have U to test? But ""ABUSE"" uses B and U? And note: we must not use T (which we know is absent)? So B and U are possible.

But ""ABUSE"": A B U S E -> S is at position 4? Then L is missing? But our feedback says L is present? Oh wait: we know L is present? Because in ""slate"", L was at position 2 and marked dash? So L must be in the word? Therefore we must include L? Because when a letter gets a dash or check, it means it is in the word? Yes.

Therefore, we cannot ignore L? Our guess must include L? Because we know L is present? So guess must contain S, L, A, E (and one more letter).

So in ""AISLE"", we have: A, I, S, L, E -> so L is included? at position 4. So it's valid.

Similarly, what about ""ALL SE""? But repeated L? We don't know if duplicates? So let's try ""AISLE"".

But note: we have two scenarios:

If the secret word has A at position 1, then ""AISLE"" with A at 1 might be correct? But we don't know.

If the secret has A at position 4, then A at 1 in ""AISLE"" would be marked as not correct? And we would see dash for A? Then we learn A is at 4? But then we have L at 4? And if we put L at 4? Wait no: in ""AISLE"", A is at 1 and L at 4? So if A is actually at 4? Then L at 4 would be wrong? Actually, no: because A at 4, then L must be elsewhere? But we don't know.

Alternatively, let's consider: instead of testing A at 1, we test A at 4? Then we could learn more? 

Consider: A at position 4.

Then: _ _ _ A E

We must assign S and L? And one other letter? Without putting S at 1, L not at 2? And S not at 1? 

Options:

Position 1: can put L? Because L was at position 2 and wasn't correct? So we haven't tried L at 1? So let Position 1: L? Then Position 2: must not be L? So put S at 3? Position 3? Or put Position 2: S? But S hasn't been tried at position 2? 

But note: if we put L at 1: ? L ? ? E but the word is L ? ? A E

Then we can:

Position 1: L? 
Position 2: we can try a new letter? But S cannot be at 1? But we put L at 1? So S must be at position 3? Because if we put S at 2? Then S at position 2? We haven't tried S at 2. Similarly, position 3 is free? 

Also, we have position 3 and 2 available? 

What word: ""C ?"" ... but without C. 

Word like ""LEASE""? But has E in position 1? Actually, no: we are putting L at position 1? Then we need S somewhere? And A at 4.

""LEAVE""? L E A V E? But we don't know V? And also, A at 3? Then E? But E is already in position 5? And we have E at 2? But the word has two E's? Possible.

But note: ""LEAVE"" has E at position 2? And 5? And A at position 3? Then we have:

Positions: 1:L, 2:E, 3:A, 4:V, 5:E? But we know E is at 5? And we haven't tested V? But also, we are missing S? Because S must be in the word? But ""LEAVE"" has L,E,A,V,E? No S? We cannot skip S? So discard.

We need a word that includes S? So:

What about ""LOSES""? But fails: S repeated? And not starting? But we need L and A and S. And E at the end.

""LASED""? L A S E D? But E is at position 4? And we require E at 5? And we have to have E at 5? So not valid.

We need E at the end? So ? ? ? A E

With letters L, S, and one more? And E at the end? So the word must be: ? ? ? A E

Where we put L at 1? Then we need S? And another letter? And avoid T,C,R,N.

""LUCRE""? But C? Not allowed.

""LAPSE"": L A P S E -> but positions:
  1: L? 
  2: A? but we know A cannot be at position 2 (from first feedback)? Because ""crane"" had A at 2 and it got dash? Meaning A is in the word but not at position 2? So A at position 2 in this guess wouldn't be correct? Hence, we should avoid? 

But in ""lapse"", if we put A at 2? Then we are putting A in a known wrong position? That gives no new information? 

Actually, we cannot put A at 2? Because we know A is not at position 2? So the word must not have A at 2? But we are trying to put A at position 4? In this scenario. 

Wait, no: if we are testing A at position 4? Then in ""lapse"", A is at position 2? So we must not choose that.

So we want a word that has A at position 4? Then the pattern: ? ? ? A E

And we can put L at position 1? Then the next positions: 2 and 3: we assign one to S and another to a new letter? Without S at 1? And without L at 2? 

But position 2: what? We can put a new letter? Then position 3: S? And A at 4? 

Word: L ? S A E ? 

What can go in position 2? 

Examples: ""LIBRA""? But R? Absent? And not ending E? 

""LIASE""? Is that word? No.

""LEASE"": L E A S E? But A at position 3, not 4? Pattern: L E A S E -> then A at 3? And S at 4? And E at 5? But wait: we are trying to put A at 4? So wrong.

But we want A at position 4? So the word must have the fourth letter A? And then E at 5? And L at 1? Then position 2 and 3: can be S and a new letter? Or vice versa? 

Word: ? ? ? A E with L at 1:  L ? ? A E

Then position 2: we can put any that is not T,C,R,N? And S must be in the word? So we can put S at position 2: then L S ? A E -> what can be in position 3? It must be a letter? Words like: ""LYASE""? But not common.

""LASSO"" but ends O? No.

""LASED""? But E is not at 4? And we need E at end? So L ? ? A E -> that's five letters? So positions: L, x, y, A, E

What words: ""LUMPS""? doesn't have A? Not.

""LAPJE""? Not English.

""LATKE"" but T is absent? T is eliminated? 

Perhaps it's easier to test A at position 1? 

Therefore, I return to testing A at 1? And include L and S? And a new letter.

So pattern: A ? ? ? E

With S present? (must not be in 1? We put at 2,3,4) 
L present? (must not be in 2? We put at 3 or 4)

And we have to fill two positions? For example, put S at position 2? Then L at position 3? And what at 4? A new letter? 

Word: A S L ? E? Like ""ASLIE""? Not word.

Or A ? L ? E? With S at position 4: A ? L S E? 

Examples: ""ABULSE"" has extra letters.

Or ""AISLE"": A I S L E

Again: positions: A at1, I at2, S at3, L at4, E at5? 

Yes, ""aisle"" is a word and it meets:

- A at 1? Testing that.
- I is new? 
- S at 3? New position? 
- L at 4? New position? And E at5? known.
- Letters: so we test I? Which is good.

Alternatively ""AMBLE""? But M? And L at position 4? Similarly.

Another option: ""Apses""? But S repeated? And E at5? Not.

I think ""AISLE"" is a good candidate.

But we also consider ""ABASE"": A B A S E? Repeated A? Also not include L? But we must include L? So ignore.

Another: ""ALWAYS""? But Y? And no S? And not ends E? 

So better ""AISLE""

But what about ""AISLES""? Too long? 

No, we need 5-letter word: ""AISLE"" is 5.

So we go with ""AISLE"": 

  A in position 1 -> we see if it's correct? 
  I in position 2 -> check if new letter present?
  S in position 3 -> check correct?
  L in position 4 -> check correct?
  E in position 5 -> known.

And avoid C,R,N,T? Yes, ""AISLE"" doesn't have any of these.

So let's guess ""AISLE""

<guess>aisle</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:

#### From Guess 1 (""crane""):
- **C**: ❌ (not in word)
- **R**: ❌ (not in word)
- **A**: ➖ (in word, but not position 2)
- **N**: ❌ (not in word)
- **E**: ✓ (correct position: position 5)

#### From Guess 2 (""slate""):
- **S**: ➖ (in word, but not position 1)
- **L**: ➖ (in word, but not position 2)
- **A**: ➖ (in word, but not position 3)
- **T**: ❌ (not in word)
- **E**: ✓ (confirmed position 5)

#### Key Deductions:
1. The word ends with **E** (position 5).
2. **A**, **S**, and **L** are in the word, but:
   - **A** is not in positions 2 or 3 (eliminated).
   - **S** is not in position 1 (eliminated).
   - **L** is not in position 2 (eliminated).
3. Absent letters: **C**, **R**, **N**, **T** (cannot be used).
4. **A** must be in position 1 or 4 (only remaining positions).
5. **S** must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
6. **L** must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

For this guess:
- Test **A** at position 1 (since position 4 remains untested and could be validated later).
- Place **S** and **L** in new positions to maximize information:
  - **S** cannot be in position 1→ placed at position 3.
  - **L** cannot be in position 2→ placed at position 4.
- Introduce a new letter **I** at position 2 to test for presence.
- Structure: **A** (position 1), **I** (position 2), **S** (position 3), **L** (position 4), **E** (position 5).

The word **aisle** fits all constraints:
- Contains **A**, **S**, **L**, and **E**.
- Avoids forbidden letters (**C**, **R**, **N**, **T**).
- Tests **A** at position 1 and new positions for **S** and **L**.

So the secret word ends with E.\n - A is in the word but not in the second position (since it\'s marked ""-"" meaning wrong position). So A is present, but elsewhere.\n - C, R, N are not in the word at all.\n\n Therefore, the secret word:\n - Must end with E: _ _ _ _ E\n - Contains the letter A, but not as the second letter (since in ""crane"", A was in position 2).\n - Does not contain C, R, N.\n\n Now, for the second guess, we want to:\n 1. Try to place A in a different position (since it\'s not in position 2).\n 2. Include other common letters that we haven\'t tried yet (excluding C, R, N).\n 3. We know the last letter is E, so we keep that.\n\n Let\'s think of letters that are common and we haven\'t tried: \n We have tried C, R, A, N, E. So avoid C, R, N. But we know A and E are present (E in the last spot, A somewhere else).\n\n We can use other vowels or common consonants: like S, T, L, I, O, B, D, G, H, K, M, P, U, etc.\n\n Also, we must avoid putting A in position 2 again (but it could be in position 1, 3, or 4).\n\n A good strategy is to use a word that has A in a new position (say position 1 or 3 or 4) and includes other new letters.\n\n Considering the feedback, the word must be of the form: [letter] [letter] [letter] [letter] E\n\n Since A is not in position 2, let\'s try putting A in position 1. Then the word would start with A.\n\n Also, we want to cover new letters. Let\'s try a word like ""ALIKE"", but note we haven\'t tried L, I, K.\n\n But wait: the last letter is E which we know. And we want to use the known E at the end.\n\n Potential word: ""ABUSE"" - but we don\'t know about B, U, S and it has A at position 1 and E at the end. However, note that in the first guess we had A at position 2 and it was present, so it\'s possible that A appears elsewhere and we don\'t know if it can be at start? Actually, we don\'t know yet. But we must not put A at position 2 because that was already tried and wrong position? Actually, the feedback only tells us that in the word ""crane"", A was in the word but not at the correct position. It might be that the correct position is position 1? We don\'t know until we try.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in a position we haven\'t tried: positions 1, 3, or 4.\n\n Let\'s list words that end with E and contain A and exclude C, R, N.\n\n Some options:\n\n - ""SAUTE"": S at start, A at position 2? But feedback told us that when A was in position 2 (in crane) it was present but wrong position. Now, if we put A in position 2 again? Actually, we can put A in position 2 again? But note: the feedback didn\'t say A cannot be in position 2, it said it is in the word but not in that position. So it could be that the word actually has A in a different position. However, if we put A in position 2 again and it still is not the correct position, then we know it must be placed elsewhere. But we want to maximize information. Maybe avoid position 2 for now until we test another position.\n\n So let\'s avoid position 2 for A for now.\n\n We can try:\n\n Position 1: A? => word pattern A _ _ _ E\n Examples: ABASE, ABATE, ADAGE, AGATE, ALATE, ALIKE, ALONE? (note: avoid N -> so no ALONE). \n\n But note: we don\'t know if A is at position 1. It could be at position 3 or 4.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in position 3 or 4.\n\n Also, we need to include other new letters.\n\n Common letters: Let\'s try S, T, L, I, O, etc.\n\n After excluding C, R, N, we are left with many. What about:\n\n - ""PLATE"": P L A T E -> but we know E is at end? Yes. And A is at position 3? That\'s a new position. Also, we test P, L, T.\n\n However, note: the feedback for our first guess (crane) had A at position 2 being present but wrong. Now in ""PLATE"", A is at position 3. It might be that the correct position for A is 3? Not necessarily, it could be 1 or 4. But at least we test position 3.\n\n Alternatively, ""SLATE"": S L A T E -> but that has A at position 3 again.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if S, L, T are in the word. We haven\'t tested them.\n\n Another idea: if we use a word with A at position 1, we can also test other common letters.\n\n Let me choose ""ADIEU"" but note: it ends with U, not E. We need E at the end.\n\n Wait, we must have E at the end. So we need a word that ends with E and has A and doesn\'t use C, R, N.\n\n Also, note we are not forced to include A. But we know A is in the word, so we should include it.\n\n Let me choose ""SAUTE"": S A U T E -> but that has A at position 2. We are unsure about position 2? We know from feedback that A is not in position 2? Actually, the feedback only says A is in the word but not at position 2. So it could be in the word at position 1, 3 or 4? However, note: the feedback does not preclude that position 2 might be A? Wait, no: if the secret word had A in position 2, then when we guessed ""crane"" with A in position 2, it would have been marked with a check. Since it was not, we know A is not in position 2. Therefore, we must avoid putting A in position 2? Or we can put it but we already know it\'s wrong? Actually, we can put it again to confirm? But that might be a waste. Better to test a different position.\n\n So let\'s choose a word with A in position 1: Examples:\n\n - ""ABASE"": A B A S E -> but note, repeated A. We haven\'t tested B and S. However, it\'s valid. But with repeated letters? We don\'t know if the word has repeated letters. It\'s possible.\n\n Feedback: we know A is in the word, but if the secret word has two A\'s? Our feedback for ""crane"" didn\'t indicate that. But note: when we guessed ""crane"", we only had one A and it was marked present. That doesn\'t rule out two A\'s.\n\n However, let\'s avoid repetition for now.\n\n Let me choose ""AGAPE"": but again two A\'s? \n\n Or ""ADOBE"": no C,R,N? A D O B E -> O and B are new? And A at position 1? That\'s valid.\n\n But ""ADOBE"" ends with E? Yes.\n\n Alternatively, ""ALIKE"": A L I K E -> A at 1, and ends with E? Yes.\n\n Let\'s go with ""ALIKE"": we test A in position 1 and new letters L, I, K.\n\n But note: we know the word has E at the end and we have E in position 5 again? Actually, in feedback we already know E is at position 5. But guessing a word with E at position 5 again is fine because we can confirm and also test the rest.\n\n However, in position 1 we put A. We don\'t know if A should be at position 1 or not.\n\n Also, we are testing L, I, K.\n\n Alternatively, we can also try ""STALE"": S T A L E -> A at position 3? That\'s a new position. And S, T, L are new.\n\n Since we don\'t know where A is, testing position 3 is as good as position 1? Actually, we are testing two possibilities: position 1 and position 3. We can do either.\n\n I think ""STALE"" is a good candidate because S, T, L are common letters and A is at position 3 (which we haven\'t tried). But what if the A is actually at position 1? Then we won\'t test that. So maybe ""ATONE"" -> but avoids N? We can\'t use N? Because we know N is not in the word? Actually, the feedback said N was not present? So N is absent.\n\n So we cannot use N. Therefore, ""ATONE"" is invalid because it has N.\n\n How about ""STAGE"": S T A G E -> A at position 3? Then we test S, T, G.\n\n That\'s also good.\n\n Another option: ""SLATE"" -> S L A T E -> A at position 3? S, L, T.\n\n I think ""SLATE"" is a common word.\n\n But note: the feedback says we have E at the end. So we know that. We don\'t need to change the E.\n\n However, in ""SLATE"": \n   Position 1: S -> not tested before.\n   Position 2: L -> not tested.\n   Position 3: A -> we know A is in the word, here it\'s placed in a new position (3). \n   Position 4: T -> not tested.\n   Position 5: E -> already known.\n\n This word gives us information for S, L, T and checks A in position 3.\n\n Also, note: we don\'t use any forbidden letters (C, R, N).\n\n Alternatively, we can choose ""SAUCE"" -> but C is forbidden? We know C is not in the word? Actually, feedback said C(x). So avoid C.\n\n So ""SLATE"" seems good.\n\n What about ""PLATE""? P L A T E -> covers P, L, T. Also A at position 3.\n\n I don\'t see a strong preference. But let\'s go with ""SLATE"" because it uses more common letters? T is more common than P.\n\n Actually, yes. So we choose ""SLATE"".\n\n But wait: we have the possibility that A could be at position 1? But by putting it at position 3, if it gets marked as absent then we know it must be at position 4? Actually, no: the feedback will tell us for A if it\'s present and if so what position.\n\n Because the feedback per letter will tell us:\n\n - If A in SLATE (position 3) gets a ✓, then we know A is at position 3.\n - If A gets a \'-\', then we know A is present but not at 3 -> meaning it must be at position 1 or 4? \n - But note: if A is at position 1 and we put it at position 3, it would be marked with a \'-\' meaning it\'s present elsewhere.\n\n So we can get information about the position of A.\n\n Similarly, by testing S, L, T we get information.\n\n So let\'s guess ""SLATE"".\n\n<guess>slate</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **E(✓)** confirms that the secret word ends with `E`.\n- **A(-)** means the letter `A` is in the word but not in position 2.\n- **C(x)**, **R(x)**, and **N(x)** indicate these letters are not in the word.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- The word must end with `E` (position 5).\n- It must include `A` but avoid position 2 (since position 2 was incorrect for `A`).\n- We cannot use `C`, `R`, or `N`.\n- New letters should be tested to gather more information, focusing on common consonants like `S`, `L`, and `T`.\n\nI selected **slate** as the guess:\n- Positions: `S` (test position 1), `L` (test position 2), `A` (test position 3, avoiding position 2), `T` (test position 4), `E` (confirmed position 5).\n- This tests `A` in a new position (3) and introduces `S`, `L`, and `T`—frequent letters not yet evaluated.\n\n<guess>slate</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two sets of feedback:\n\nFirst guess: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)\nThis tells us:\n- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th).\n- A is in the word but not in the 2nd position.\n- C, R, N are not in the word.\n\nSecond guess: slate -> S(-) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(✓)\nThis tells us:\n- E is again confirmed in the 5th position (we already knew this).\n- S, L, A are all present but none of them are in the correct position in ""slate"".\n  Specifically:\n    S is not in position 1\n    L is not in position 2\n    A is not in position 3\n- T is not in the word at all.\n\nAdditionally, we know:\n- The word ends with E: ? ? ? ?

But S was in position 1 and got a dash, meaning S is not in position 1, but it is in the word. So S might be in 2,3,4? Similarly, L is not in 2, and A is not in 2 or 3.\n\nSince A must be in position 1 or 4, let\'s consider trying A in position 1 in this guess.\n\nAlso, we need to place S and L in positions where we have not ruled them out. For S: we tried position 1 and it was wrong -> S must be in 2,3 or 4? But wait, we have slot 2,3,4 available. Similarly L: we tried position 2 which was wrong, so L must be in 1,3,4 -> but position 1 might be taken by A? So we consider.\n\nBut note: in the second guess, slate had:\n  pos1: S (not correct, but present) -> so S is in the word, just not at 1 -> thus S must be at 2,3, or 4.\n  pos2: L (not correct, but present) -> L must be at 1,3, or 4.\n\nHowever, if we try A at position 1, then we cannot put L at 1 (same position). Similarly, S cannot go to 1.\n\nSo the letters we must place: A, S, L and the last is E known. Plus we need one more letter.\n\nThe format: _ _ _ _ E\n\nWe are missing the 4th letter? Wait, we have four positions: 1,2,3,4. We know E is at 5.\n\nWe know the word has S, L, A, E and one more letter? Because so far we have found 4 letters: A, S, L, E? But our feedback only guaranteed A, S, L, E are present. However, we haven\'t tested all letters. There must be one more letter in position 3 or somewhere? Actually, the word has 5 letters. We only know 4: A, S, L, E? Or perhaps there are 5 distinct letters? The feedback doesn\'t rule out duplicates, but we haven\'t seen any duplicates. Let\'s proceed.\n\nWe need a fifth letter that is not C, R, N, T (because these are absent). And we don\'t know about other letters.\n\nFor the new guess, we must form a 5-letter word that:\n- Ends with E (position 5).\n- Contains A, S, L, and E (with E fixed at position 5).\n- Does not contain C, R, N, T.\n- And we must avoid putting A in position 2 or 3 (already tried) -> so only position 1 or 4 for A.\n- Also avoid S in position 1 (because that was tried) -> S can only be in 2,3,4.\n- Avoid L in position 2 -> L can be in 1,3,4.\n\nBut if we put A in position 1, then position 1 is occupied. Then S cannot be in 1? But we already avoid S in 1 so that\'s ok. Similarly, L cannot be in 1 because A is there? Then L must go to 3 or 4.\n\nSimilarly, if we put A in position 4, then position 4 is occupied.\n\nLet\'s try to build with A in position 1:\n\nSo: A _ _ _ E\n\nNow, we must assign S and L to positions 2,3,4? But without putting S at 1 (which we avoid) and L not in 2? So:\n\n- Position 2: cannot put L (because L was in position 2 and got a dash? Actually, we know L is not at position 2). So we can put S in position 2? Because S could be at 2? Then L must be placed in position 3 or 4? And we have position 3 open?\n\nActually, the positions we have to assign to S: only 2,3,4? But we can put S in 2? Similarly L in 3 or 4? But note: the word must be valid.\n\nAlternatively, A in position 4:\n\nThen: _ _ _ A E\n\nNow, assign S and L: S cannot be in 1? So S in position 2 or 3? L can be in position 1,3? But wait: position 1 is free? And L can be in position 1? Then we can have L at 1 and then S at 2 or 3? Also note: L was not tried in position 1? And S not tried in 2 or 3? So that\'s possible.\n\nBut we don\'t know which scenario (A at 1 or A at 4) is correct. We want to test A at 1? Then we should set A at 1 in this guess? Then we can get immediate feedback on A\'s position.\n\nSo let me try A in position 1.\n\nThus: A ? ? ? E\n\nWe need to assign S and L: and one more letter? Because we have three positions: 2,3,4.\n\nThe known letters we have to place: S and L. Then the fourth letter (for slot 2,3,4) must be an unknown letter? Actually, we have four letters: A, E, S, L. So the fifth letter is missing? Therefore the word has at least these four, but we need a fifth.\n\nWe have to choose one more letter (not C,R,N,T) and put it in one of the spots? And then assign S and L to the other two?\n\nAlso, we must not put S in position 1? But we are not putting S in 1 because we have A. Similarly L not in 2? So we can:\n\nOption: put S in position 2? Then we must put L in position 3 or 4? And the remaining position (either 3 or 4) for a new letter.\n\nBut note: if we put S in 2, that\'s a new position? We don\'t know about position 2 for S? Similarly, L in 3: we haven\'t tried L in 3? Position 4? Also.\n\nBut we know L was tried in position 2 and was wrong? But we can try L in 3 or 4.\n\nSimilarly, we can avoid position 2 for L? That is, we know L cannot be at 2? So in this guess, we don\'t put L at 2? Which is okay.\n\nSimilarly, S cannot be at 1? But we are putting S at 2? So:\n\nPosition 1: A\nPosition 2: S? \nPosition 3: ? \nPosition 4: ? \nPosition 5: E\n\nAnd L must go to position 3 or 4? And the other position is a new letter.\n\nBut we must avoid any letter that we know is absent? Not just C,R,N,T? But we haven\'t tested many.\n\nAlternatively, since A is at 1, and we need a word that works.\n\nCommon words: \n- Consider ""AISLE"": A I S L E -> E at end? Yes. \nBut check: \n  Position 1: A -> we are testing A at 1? So it might be correct? \n  Position 2: I -> new letter.\n  Position 3: S -> we haven\'t tried S in 3? \n  Position 4: L -> L in position 4? \n  Position 5: E.\n\nAnd the letters: A,I,S,L,E. \nAbsent letters we know: C,R,N,T -> I is not eliminated? Okay.\n\nBut note: feedback for A in the second guess was dash? But that\'s because it was at position 3? Now we are moving A to position 1? So it might be correct? We don\'t know.\n\nBut let\'s check if it violates any known restrictions:\n- We don\'t put S in 1? Here S is at position 3? So okay.\n- We don\'t put L in position 2? Here L is at position 4? Okay.\n- A is at position 1? We hope to get feedback if it\'s correct.\n\nBut what about S? We have S in the word? Yes. And we are placing S at position 3? Which we haven\'t tried? \n\nBut note: we have two possibilities for S: it might be at 2,3,4? We are testing 3.\n\nSimilarly, L: we are testing at position 4? And we haven\'t tried position 4 for L? \n\nAlso, we are testing I? So getting I tested is good.\n\nHowever, wait: the word ""AISLE""? We have previously tested A and we know it is present? But now we are putting A at position 1? If the secret word has A at 4? Then in this guess: A at position 1 would be marked as not correct (since it should be at 4)? I.e., a dash? So we learn.\n\nBut note: we also have to consider that there might be a duplicate? But let\'s try.\n\nAnother word with A at 1: ""ALOSE""? Is it valid? ALOSE? Not common. Better use ""ABUSE""? But we don\'t know B and we have U to test? But ""ABUSE"" uses B and U? And note: we must not use T (which we know is absent)? So B and U are possible.\n\nBut ""ABUSE"": A B U S E -> S is at position 4? Then L is missing? But our feedback says L is present? Oh wait: we know L is present? Because in ""slate"", L was at position 2 and marked dash? So L must be in the word? Therefore we must include L? Because when a letter gets a dash or check, it means it is in the word? Yes.\n\nTherefore, we cannot ignore L? Our guess must include L? Because we know L is present? So guess must contain S, L, A, E (and one more letter).\n\nSo in ""AISLE"", we have: A, I, S, L, E -> so L is included? at position 4. So it\'s valid.\n\nSimilarly, what about ""ALL SE""? But repeated L? We don\'t know if duplicates? So let\'s try ""AISLE"".\n\nBut note: we have two scenarios:\n\nIf the secret word has A at position 1, then ""AISLE"" with A at 1 might be correct? But we don\'t know.\n\nIf the secret has A at position 4, then A at 1 in ""AISLE"" would be marked as not correct? And we would see dash for A? Then we learn A is at 4? But then we have L at 4? And if we put L at 4? Wait no: in ""AISLE"", A is at 1 and L at 4? So if A is actually at 4? Then L at 4 would be wrong? Actually, no: because A at 4, then L must be elsewhere? But we don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, let\'s consider: instead of testing A at 1, we test A at 4? Then we could learn more? \n\nConsider: A at position 4.\n\nThen: _ _ _ A E\n\nWe must assign S and L? And one other letter? Without putting S at 1, L not at 2? And S not at 1? \n\nOptions:\n\nPosition 1: can put L? Because L was at position 2 and wasn\'t correct? So we haven\'t tried L at 1? So let Position 1: L? Then Position 2: must not be L? So put S at 3? Position 3? Or put Position 2: S? But S hasn\'t been tried at position 2? \n\nBut note: if we put L at 1: ? L ? ? E but the word is L ? ? A E\n\nThen we can:\n\nPosition 1: L? \nPosition 2: we can try a new letter? But S cannot be at 1? But we put L at 1? So S must be at position 3? Because if we put S at 2? Then S at position 2? We haven\'t tried S at 2. Similarly, position 3 is free? \n\nAlso, we have position 3 and 2 available? \n\nWhat word: ""C ?"" ... but without C. \n\nWord like ""LEASE""? But has E in position 1? Actually, no: we are putting L at position 1? Then we need S somewhere? And A at 4.\n\n""LEAVE""? L E A V E? But we don\'t know V? And also, A at 3? Then E? But E is already in position 5? And we have E at 2? But the word has two E\'s? Possible.\n\nBut note: ""LEAVE"" has E at position 2? And 5? And A at position 3? Then we have:\n\nPositions: 1:L, 2:E, 3:A, 4:V, 5:E? But we know E is at 5? And we haven\'t tested V? But also, we are missing S? Because S must be in the word? But ""LEAVE"" has L,E,A,V,E? No S? We cannot skip S? So discard.\n\nWe need a word that includes S? So:\n\nWhat about ""LOSES""? But fails: S repeated? And not starting? But we need L and A and S. And E at the end.\n\n""LASED""? L A S E D? But E is at position 4? And we require E at 5? And we have to have E at 5? So not valid.\n\nWe need E at the end? So ? ? ? A E\n\nWith letters L, S, and one more? And E at the end? So the word must be: ? ? ? A E\n\nWhere we put L at 1? Then we need S? And another letter? And avoid T,C,R,N.\n\n""LUCRE""? But C? Not allowed.\n\n""LAPSE"": L A P S E -> but positions:\n  1: L? \n  2: A? but we know A cannot be at position 2 (from first feedback)? Because ""crane"" had A at 2 and it got dash? Meaning A is in the word but not at position 2? So A at position 2 in this guess wouldn\'t be correct? Hence, we should avoid? \n\nBut in ""lapse"", if we put A at 2? Then we are putting A in a known wrong position? That gives no new information? \n\nActually, we cannot put A at 2? Because we know A is not at position 2? So the word must not have A at 2? But we are trying to put A at position 4? In this scenario. \n\nWait, no: if we are testing A at position 4? Then in ""lapse"", A is at position 2? So we must not choose that.\n\nSo we want a word that has A at position 4? Then the pattern: ? ? ? A E\n\nAnd we can put L at position 1? Then the next positions: 2 and 3: we assign one to S and another to a new letter? Without S at 1? And without L at 2? \n\nBut position 2: what? We can put a new letter? Then position 3: S? And A at 4? \n\nWord: L ? S A E ? \n\nWhat can go in position 2? \n\nExamples: ""LIBRA""? But R? Absent? And not ending E? \n\n""LIASE""? Is that word? No.\n\n""LEASE"": L E A S E? But A at position 3, not 4? Pattern: L E A S E -> then A at 3? And S at 4? And E at 5? But wait: we are trying to put A at 4? So wrong.\n\nBut we want A at position 4? So the word must have the fourth letter A? And then E at 5? And L at 1? Then position 2 and 3: can be S and a new letter? Or vice versa? \n\nWord: ? ? ? A E with L at 1:  L ? ? A E\n\nThen position 2: we can put any that is not T,C,R,N? And S must be in the word? So we can put S at position 2: then L S ? A E -> what can be in position 3? It must be a letter? Words like: ""LYASE""? But not common.\n\n""LASSO"" but ends O? No.\n\n""LASED""? But E is not at 4? And we need E at end? So L ? ? A E -> that\'s five letters? So positions: L, x, y, A, E\n\nWhat words: ""LUMPS""? doesn\'t have A? Not.\n\n""LAPJE""? Not English.\n\n""LATKE"" but T is absent? T is eliminated? \n\nPerhaps it\'s easier to test A at position 1? \n\nTherefore, I return to testing A at 1? And include L and S? And a new letter.\n\nSo pattern: A ? ? ? E\n\nWith S present? (must not be in 1? We put at 2,3,4) \nL present? (must not be in 2? We put at 3 or 4)\n\nAnd we have to fill two positions? For example, put S at position 2? Then L at position 3? And what at 4? A new letter? \n\nWord: A S L ? E? Like ""ASLIE""? Not word.\n\nOr A ? L ? E? With S at position 4: A ? L S E? \n\nExamples: ""ABULSE"" has extra letters.\n\nOr ""AISLE"": A I S L E\n\nAgain: positions: A at1, I at2, S at3, L at4, E at5? \n\nYes, ""aisle"" is a word and it meets:\n\n- A at 1? Testing that.\n- I is new? \n- S at 3? New position? \n- L at 4? New position? And E at5? known.\n- Letters: so we test I? Which is good.\n\nAlternatively ""AMBLE""? But M? And L at position 4? Similarly.\n\nAnother option: ""Apses""? But S repeated? And E at5? Not.\n\nI think ""AISLE"" is a good candidate.\n\nBut we also consider ""ABASE"": A B A S E? Repeated A? Also not include L? But we must include L? So ignore.\n\nAnother: ""ALWAYS""? But Y? And no S? And not ends E? \n\nSo better ""AISLE""\n\nBut what about ""AISLES""? Too long? \n\nNo, we need 5-letter word: ""AISLE"" is 5.\n\nSo we go with ""AISLE"": \n\n  A in position 1 -> we see if it\'s correct? \n  I in position 2 -> check if new letter present?\n  S in position 3 -> check correct?\n  L in position 4 -> check correct?\n  E in position 5 -> known.\n\nAnd avoid C,R,N,T? Yes, ""AISLE"" doesn\'t have any of these.\n\nSo let\'s guess ""AISLE""\n\n<guess>aisle</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n\n#### From Guess 1 (""crane""):\n- **C**: ❌ (not in word)\n- **R**: ❌ (not in word)\n- **A**: ➖ (in word, but not position 2)\n- **N**: ❌ (not in word)\n- **E**: ✓ (correct position: position 5)\n\n#### From Guess 2 (""slate""):\n- **S**: ➖ (in word, but not position 1)\n- **L**: ➖ (in word, but not position 2)\n- **A**: ➖ (in word, but not position 3)\n- **T**: ❌ (not in word)\n- **E**: ✓ (confirmed position 5)\n\n#### Key Deductions:\n1. The word ends with **E** (position 5).\n2. **A**, **S**, and **L** are in the word, but:\n   - **A** is not in positions 2 or 3 (eliminated).\n   - **S** is not in position 1 (eliminated).\n   - **L** is not in position 2 (eliminated).\n3. Absent letters: **C**, **R**, **N**, **T** (cannot be used).\n4. **A** must be in position 1 or 4 (only remaining positions).\n5. **S** must be in position 2, 3, or 4.\n6. **L** must be in position 1, 3, or 4.\n\nFor this guess:\n- Test **A** at position 1 (since position 4 remains untested and could be validated later).\n- Place **S** and **L** in new positions to maximize information:\n  - **S** cannot be in position 1→ placed at position 3.\n  - **L** cannot be in position 2→ placed at position 4.\n- Introduce a new letter **I** at position 2 to test for presence.\n- Structure: **A** (position 1), **I** (position 2), **S** (position 3), **L** (position 4), **E** (position 5).\n\nThe word **aisle** fits all constraints:\n- Contains **A**, **S**, **L**, and **E**.\n- Avoids forbidden letters (**C**, **R**, **N**, **T**).\n- Tests **A** at position 1 and new positions for **S** and **L**.\n\n<guess>aisle</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: aisle -> FEEDBACK: A(-) I(x) S(-) L(-) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We now have feedback from the third guess: ""aisle"" -> A(-) I(x) S(-) L(-) E(✓)

Let's recap all feedback so far:

**From guess 1 (crane):**
- C: absent (x)
- R: absent (x)
- A: present, but not in position 2 (rightmost hint shows positions: crane is c(1), r(2), a(3), n(4), e(5)? Actually, in ""crane"", A is at position 3? Wait, no: positions: 
  Position 1: C -> x
  Position 2: R -> x
  Position 3: A -> present but wrong position? The user feedback: ""A(-)"" and it was the third letter? In the input ""crane"", the third letter is A? So A was in position 3? And marked with (-), meaning A is in the word but not in position 3?

Wait, the feedback format: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
So this corresponds to:
- Position 1: C (x)
- Position 2: R (x)
- Position 3: A (-) -> so A is in word, not at pos 3
- Position 4: N (x)
- Position 5: E (✓)

Similarly, guess 2: slate -> 
- Position 1: S (-)
- Position 2: L (-)
- Position 3: A (-)
- Position 4: T (x)
- Position 5: E (✓)

Guess 3: aisle ->
- Position 1: A (-)
- Position 2: I (x)
- Position 3: S (-)
- Position 4: L (-)
- Position 5: E (✓)

So absolute knowns:
1. E is fixed at position 5: ???E? -> now the word ends with E. The pattern is [1][2][3][4]E

2. A is present, but we now know:
- From guess 1: not at position 3 (since in crane, A at pos3 marked -)
- From guess 2: not at position 3 again? But already known? No new info. Actually, guess2 also had A at pos3? And it was marked - again? 
- From guess 3: not at position 1 (since in aisle, A at pos1 marked -)

Therefore, A must be at position 4? Because positions: 1 (eliminated by guess3), 2 (eliminated by guess1? Actually no: guess1 only said A not at pos3? Wait, guess1: A was at pos3 and got dash? That only eliminates pos3? Similarly, guess2: A at pos3 again? Same. Guess3: A at pos1 -> dash? Eliminates pos1. So the only position left is position 4? Or position 2? But wait: we don't have any feedback that A is not at position 2? 

How about the position 2? 
In guess1: we tried R at position 2 and got x? That means R is absent, but doesn't say about A? 
In guess2: we tried L at position 2 and got dash? That means L is present but not at position 2? Doesn't say anything about A? 
We never tried A at position 2? So it might be possible? 

So A could be at position 2 or 4? 
But wait: in guess1: we didn't try position2 for A? In guess1, position2 was R? 
In guess2: position2 was L? 
In guess3: position1 was A? 

So A has not been tried at position 2? So position 2 remains a possibility? Also position 4? 

But in the word, the positions are 1-5? 
We eliminated position 1 (by guess3)? 
We eliminated position 3 (by guess1 and 2)? 
Position 5 is E? So only position 2 or 4 for A? 

So A must be at position 2 or 4? 

3. S is present:
- From guess2: not at position 1 (marked dash at pos1 when guessed in slate)
- From guess3: not at position 3 (marked dash at pos3 when guessed in aisle)
- Also, what about position 4? We haven't tried position 4 for S? 
  So S could be at position 2, or 4? 

4. L is present:
- From guess2: not at position 2 (marked dash at pos2 in slate)
- From guess3: not at position 4 (marked dash at pos4 in aisle) -> because in aisle, L at pos4 got dash? 
  Also, we tried L at position 4? And it was present but wrong position? So L is not at position 4? 
  But could L be at position 1? Or 3? 
  Positions: we have not tried L at position 1 or 3? 
  Because: 
    In guess2: L was at position 2 -> eliminated
    In guess3: L was at position 4 -> eliminated
  So L must be at position 1 or 3? 

5. I is absent? (guess3: I at position2 marked x? So I is not in the word? 

6. T is absent (already known from guess2)

7. C, R, N are absent.

Now, we know the word has: A, S, L, E? But must have one more letter? Since 5 letters? So we need a fifth letter? Which we haven't found? We have tested E, A, S, L? But we tested other letters? We tested C,R,N,T,I? Absent? So more letters to guess? 

Also, we haven't tested many consonants? And the fifth letter might be one that hasn't been tested? 

Now, let's organize the possibilities:

Position 1: Could be L? (since L must be at 1 or 3) or could be the fifth letter? But we have A, S, L to place? 

But note: positions: 
We know A must be at 2 or 4? 
S must be at 2 or 4? But if A and S are both at 2 or 4? They might conflict? 

Also, L must be at 1 or 3? 

And we know E at 5? 

So the pattern is: 

If A at position 2 and S at position 4? Then pattern: [L? at1 or3] A [L? at3 or what?] and S at4? 

But note: position3 might have L? Or the fifth letter?

Similarly, if A at4 and S at2? Then: [L? at1 or3] S [L? or other] A E? 

So we should pick a guess that uses only the known present letters? And one new letter? Also avoiding absent letters? But what new letter to choose? 

But we must include all known present letters? So we know A, S, L, E are present? So the fifth letter is missing? Which one is it? 

So we must form a word with A, S, L, E, and one other letter? (not C, R, N, T, I)

Possible? 

Also, the positions: 
- L must be at 1 or 3?
- A must be at 2 or 4?
- S must be at 2 or 4? 
- E at 5.

But if L is at position 1? Then the word starts with L? 
Then position 2: must be A? Or S? Or the new letter? 
But A and S need to be at 2 or 4? 

Similarly, position 4: must be A or S? 

Case 1: Assume A at position 2? Then S must be at position 4? 
Then pattern: L A ? S E? Because position1: L? position2: A? position4: S? position5: E? 
Then position3: must be the fifth letter.

But L at1? Yes? 
A at2? 
S at4? 
E at5? 
So we get: L A ? S E? 

Then we need a word: L A ? S E? 

What could be at position3? Letters not eliminated: we haven't tested any? We tried: C,R,N,T,I? Absent? 
Possible letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? 

But common? For example, ""LEASE"" but then missing A? No? 

Try: ""LASES""? But S repeated? And L A S E S? But then S at position3 and also at4? Also E at5? So ""LASES""? But that's L A S E S -> but pattern L A S? E? S? But we know S at position4? So if ""LASES"" -> positions: 
1:L, 2:A, 3:S, 4:E, 5:S -> but S at3? We don't know? But we fixed A at2 and S at4? And E at5? But in this pattern we have S at3? So if we want S at4? Then we cannot have S at3? 

And ""LASES"" doesn't match because we put E at4? But we want E at5? And S at4? 

So the word would be: L A ? S E? 
With ? being a letter? And it can't be E? But the fifth letter? 

Example: ""LAZES""? L A Z E S? But then S at5? Not? 

Needs to be L A [letter] S E? 

""LAPSE""? But P? Then: L A P S E? 
Then positions: 
1:L, 2:A, 3:P, 4:S, 5:E? 

Then we could have A at2? S at4? So it satisfies? 

Is ""LAPSE"" a word? Yes? 

But note: we also have the possibility that A at4? 

But first we try Case 1: A at2? and S at4? ""LAPSE"" has that? 

But wait: what about L? In our scenario, we have L at1? Which is okay? 

Alternatively, if L is at position 3? Then pattern: ? ? L ? E? 

And if A at2? Then: ? A L ? E? But S must be at4? Then: ? A L S E? 

Then position1: must be a letter? 

Example: ""HALSE""? H A L S E? 

But is that a word? Not common? 

""PULSE""? But U and P? And no A? We need A at position2? 

But then we would have A at2? So ""PALSE""? Not word? 

Now, the other case: A at position4? 
Then S must be at position2? Because if A at4, then S must be at2? (since S must be at2 or4? And 4 taken)

Pattern: ? S ? A E? 

And L must be at position1 or3? 

Then:
- If L at1: L S ? A E? 
  Example: ""L S ? A E"": ""LSOAE""? Not? 

  ""LSVAE""? Not? 

- If L at3: ? S L A E? 
  Example: ""USLAE""? Not? 

""MASLAE""? 

Perhaps Case 1 is more promising.

Also, we know L must be at1 or3? But if L is at3? And we put L at3? And S at2? And A at4? Then: ? S L A E? 

We need a word: ? S L A E? 

What? ""ISLAE""? But I is absent? 
""ASLAE"" -> but A at1? We haven't tried A at1? But in this case A at4? So if first letter is something? 
""USLAE"" not? 
""PSLAE"" not? 

But let's get back: perhaps we don't need to commit? Instead, test a word that covers multiple possibilities? 

But we want to verify A's position? 

In the third guess, we tried A at1 and got dash? Meaning A is not at1? And we know not at3? So only 2 and 4? 

To test A at4? We can use a word that puts A at4? 

But we also need S? And L? 

So let's try a word that has A at4? 

Example: ? ? ? A E? 

But we need to include S and L? And S must be at2? Because if S at4? Then conflict? Or S at2? And L at1 or3? 

Also, the word must have a fifth letter? 

Try: ? S ? A E? With L at position3: ? S L A E? 

Words: ""USLAE""? Not English? 

""ISLAE"" has I? Absent? 

Maybe ""BESLA"" doesn't end E? 

Not? 

Another idea: instead? If A at4? Then S at2? And L at1? Pattern: L S ? A E? 

What? ""LS __ A E""? 

Examples: ""L S I A E"" but I absent? 
""L S O A E""? Not word? 
""L S D A E""? 

Check dictionary: ""LASED""? L A S E D? Doesn't match? 

But ""LASED"" would be L A S E D? But then A at2? Not at4? 

So we need L at1, S at2, A at4? But that would be L S [something] A E? ""L S ? A E""? 

Like ""LSGAE""? Not word? 

Perhaps we try another arrangement? Maybe put L at position3? 

Pattern: ? S L A E? 

Again, ""USLAE"" not? 

Perhaps it is not working? So maybe A at2? 

Therefore, we guess with A at2? 

And we also have L at1? 

Then S at4? 

Then the word must be: L A ? S E? 

The fifth letter at position3? 

We can choose a common letter? Like O? Or U? 

""LOUSE""? But O? Then L O U S E? But that has L at1, O at2? But we want A at2? Not O? 

But A must be at2? So we have L at1 and A at2? Then ? at3 must be a letter? And S at4? E at5? 

Possible letters: let's try B? ""LABES""? But A? Then L A B E S? But S at5? And E at4? Not? Pattern L A [letter] S E? 

So ""L A B S E"" -> ""LABSE""? Not a word? 

""L A P S E"" -> ""LAPSE"" -> valid word? 

Yes, ""lapse"" means to fall into sin? 

So let's guess ""LAPSE"": 
  Position1: L? 
  Position2: A? 
  Position3: P? 
  Position4: S? 
  Position5: E? 

This tests:
- L at position1? We haven't tried? 
- A at position2? Untried? 
- S at position4? Untried? 
- P is a new letter?

And we avoid all absent letters? 

But what if A is actually at position4? Then we won't get it? 

But if we guess ""LAPSE"", and if A is at4? Then in feedback:
- Position1: L? We know L is present? But if not correct? It will be marked dash? 
- Position2: A? If the secret has A at4? Then A at2 would be dash? 
- Position4: S? Then if S is at4? Maybe? But we haven't tried? 
But also the fifth letter P? 

Alternatively, if we want to test A at position4? We can guess a word that puts A at4? But also includes L and S? And avoids conflict? 

But we don't know: so we take a risk? 

Given the feedback so far, ""LAPSE"" seems a good candidate? 

But also, note: the word must not have any letters we know are absent? ""LAPSE"" has L,A,P,S,E? No C,R,N,T,I? So okay? 

Alternatively, ""LEASE"" but no A? And we know A must be present? 

So we choose ""LAPSE""? 

But let's check if we missed any constraint? 
We have: 
- L at position1: possible? 
- A at position2: we haven't tried position2 for A? And we need to test? 
- P at position3: new letter? 
- S at position4: we haven't tried S at position4? 
- E at position5: known? 

Yes? 

So we guess ""LAPSE""?

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:

#### Summary of Known Information:
1. **E** is firmly in position 5 (✓ in all guesses).
2. **Present letters (must be included)**:
   - **A**: In word, but eliminated from positions 1 (aisle), and 3 (crane and slate).
   - **S**: In word, but eliminated from positions 1 (slate) and 3 (aisle).
   - **L**: In word, but eliminated from positions 2 (slate) and 4 (aisle).
3. **Absent letters (cannot be used)**:
   - **C**, **R**, **N**, **T**, **I** (❌ in feedback).
4. **Constraints**:
   - **A** must be in position 2 or 4 (only untried positions left).
   - **S** must be in position 2 or 4 (only untried positions). However, **A** and **S** cannot occupy the same position.
   - **L** must be in position 1 or 3 (only untried positions).
   - The word must include one additional unknown letter (not tested yet).

#### Deductions:
- Since **L** must be at position 1 or 3, and **A**/**S** at 2 or 4, the only configuration that fits all constraints is:
  - **L** in position 1 (untried position).
  - **A** in position 2 (untried position).
  - Unknown letter in position 3.
  - **S** in position 4 (untried position).
  - **E** in position 5.
- This pattern forms **L A ? S E**, where ""?"" is a new letter not yet tested (and not **C, R, N, T, I**).

#### Strategy for Guess:
- Test **L** at position 1, **A** at position 2, and **S** at position 4 to confirm their true positions.
- Introduce a common vowel/consonant for position 3 (e.g., **P**, **D**, **M**) to maximize information gain.
- **Lapse**:
  - Fits the pattern: **L(1)**, **A(2)**, **P(3)**, **S(4)**, **E(5)**.
  - Tests all remaining constraints:
    - **L** at position 1 (pass/fail reveals correctness).
    - **A** at position 2 (direct test).
    - **S** at position 4 (direct test).
  - Introduces **P** (new letter, not eliminated).

<guess>lapse</guess>",lapse,"We now have feedback from the third guess: ""aisle"" -> A(-) I(x) S(-) L(-) E(✓)

Let's recap all feedback so far:

**From guess 1 (crane):**
- C: absent (x)
- R: absent (x)
- A: present, but not in position 2 (rightmost hint shows positions: crane is c(1), r(2), a(3), n(4), e(5)? Actually, in ""crane"", A is at position 3? Wait, no: positions: 
  Position 1: C -> x
  Position 2: R -> x
  Position 3: A -> present but wrong position? The user feedback: ""A(-)"" and it was the third letter? In the input ""crane"", the third letter is A? So A was in position 3? And marked with (-), meaning A is in the word but not in position 3?

Wait, the feedback format: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
So this corresponds to:
- Position 1: C (x)
- Position 2: R (x)
- Position 3: A (-) -> so A is in word, not at pos 3
- Position 4: N (x)
- Position 5: E (✓)

Similarly, guess 2: slate -> 
- Position 1: S (-)
- Position 2: L (-)
- Position 3: A (-)
- Position 4: T (x)
- Position 5: E (✓)

Guess 3: aisle ->
- Position 1: A (-)
- Position 2: I (x)
- Position 3: S (-)
- Position 4: L (-)
- Position 5: E (✓)

So absolute knowns:
1. E is fixed at position 5: ???E? -> now the word ends with E. The pattern is [1][2][3][4]E

2. A is present, but we now know:
- From guess 1: not at position 3 (since in crane, A at pos3 marked -)
- From guess 2: not at position 3 again? But already known? No new info. Actually, guess2 also had A at pos3? And it was marked - again? 
- From guess 3: not at position 1 (since in aisle, A at pos1 marked -)

Therefore, A must be at position 4? Because positions: 1 (eliminated by guess3), 2 (eliminated by guess1? Actually no: guess1 only said A not at pos3? Wait, guess1: A was at pos3 and got dash? That only eliminates pos3? Similarly, guess2: A at pos3 again? Same. Guess3: A at pos1 -> dash? Eliminates pos1. So the only position left is position 4? Or position 2? But wait: we don't have any feedback that A is not at position 2? 

How about the position 2? 
In guess1: we tried R at position 2 and got x? That means R is absent, but doesn't say about A? 
In guess2: we tried L at position 2 and got dash? That means L is present but not at position 2? Doesn't say anything about A? 
We never tried A at position 2? So it might be possible? 

So A could be at position 2 or 4? 
But wait: in guess1: we didn't try position2 for A? In guess1, position2 was R? 
In guess2: position2 was L? 
In guess3: position1 was A? 

So A has not been tried at position 2? So position 2 remains a possibility? Also position 4? 

But in the word, the positions are 1-5? 
We eliminated position 1 (by guess3)? 
We eliminated position 3 (by guess1 and 2)? 
Position 5 is E? So only position 2 or 4 for A? 

So A must be at position 2 or 4? 

3. S is present:
- From guess2: not at position 1 (marked dash at pos1 when guessed in slate)
- From guess3: not at position 3 (marked dash at pos3 when guessed in aisle)
- Also, what about position 4? We haven't tried position 4 for S? 
  So S could be at position 2, or 4? 

4. L is present:
- From guess2: not at position 2 (marked dash at pos2 in slate)
- From guess3: not at position 4 (marked dash at pos4 in aisle) -> because in aisle, L at pos4 got dash? 
  Also, we tried L at position 4? And it was present but wrong position? So L is not at position 4? 
  But could L be at position 1? Or 3? 
  Positions: we have not tried L at position 1 or 3? 
  Because: 
    In guess2: L was at position 2 -> eliminated
    In guess3: L was at position 4 -> eliminated
  So L must be at position 1 or 3? 

5. I is absent? (guess3: I at position2 marked x? So I is not in the word? 

6. T is absent (already known from guess2)

7. C, R, N are absent.

Now, we know the word has: A, S, L, E? But must have one more letter? Since 5 letters? So we need a fifth letter? Which we haven't found? We have tested E, A, S, L? But we tested other letters? We tested C,R,N,T,I? Absent? So more letters to guess? 

Also, we haven't tested many consonants? And the fifth letter might be one that hasn't been tested? 

Now, let's organize the possibilities:

Position 1: Could be L? (since L must be at 1 or 3) or could be the fifth letter? But we have A, S, L to place? 

But note: positions: 
We know A must be at 2 or 4? 
S must be at 2 or 4? But if A and S are both at 2 or 4? They might conflict? 

Also, L must be at 1 or 3? 

And we know E at 5? 

So the pattern is: 

If A at position 2 and S at position 4? Then pattern: [L? at1 or3] A [L? at3 or what?] and S at4? 

But note: position3 might have L? Or the fifth letter?

Similarly, if A at4 and S at2? Then: [L? at1 or3] S [L? or other] A E? 

So we should pick a guess that uses only the known present letters? And one new letter? Also avoiding absent letters? But what new letter to choose? 

But we must include all known present letters? So we know A, S, L, E are present? So the fifth letter is missing? Which one is it? 

So we must form a word with A, S, L, E, and one other letter? (not C, R, N, T, I)

Possible? 

Also, the positions: 
- L must be at 1 or 3?
- A must be at 2 or 4?
- S must be at 2 or 4? 
- E at 5.

But if L is at position 1? Then the word starts with L? 
Then position 2: must be A? Or S? Or the new letter? 
But A and S need to be at 2 or 4? 

Similarly, position 4: must be A or S? 

Case 1: Assume A at position 2? Then S must be at position 4? 
Then pattern: L A ? S E? Because position1: L? position2: A? position4: S? position5: E? 
Then position3: must be the fifth letter.

But L at1? Yes? 
A at2? 
S at4? 
E at5? 
So we get: L A ? S E? 

Then we need a word: L A ? S E? 

What could be at position3? Letters not eliminated: we haven't tested any? We tried: C,R,N,T,I? Absent? 
Possible letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? 

But common? For example, ""LEASE"" but then missing A? No? 

Try: ""LASES""? But S repeated? And L A S E S? But then S at position3 and also at4? Also E at5? So ""LASES""? But that's L A S E S -> but pattern L A S? E? S? But we know S at position4? So if ""LASES"" -> positions: 
1:L, 2:A, 3:S, 4:E, 5:S -> but S at3? We don't know? But we fixed A at2 and S at4? And E at5? But in this pattern we have S at3? So if we want S at4? Then we cannot have S at3? 

And ""LASES"" doesn't match because we put E at4? But we want E at5? And S at4? 

So the word would be: L A ? S E? 
With ? being a letter? And it can't be E? But the fifth letter? 

Example: ""LAZES""? L A Z E S? But then S at5? Not? 

Needs to be L A [letter] S E? 

""LAPSE""? But P? Then: L A P S E? 
Then positions: 
1:L, 2:A, 3:P, 4:S, 5:E? 

Then we could have A at2? S at4? So it satisfies? 

Is ""LAPSE"" a word? Yes? 

But note: we also have the possibility that A at4? 

But first we try Case 1: A at2? and S at4? ""LAPSE"" has that? 

But wait: what about L? In our scenario, we have L at1? Which is okay? 

Alternatively, if L is at position 3? Then pattern: ? ? L ? E? 

And if A at2? Then: ? A L ? E? But S must be at4? Then: ? A L S E? 

Then position1: must be a letter? 

Example: ""HALSE""? H A L S E? 

But is that a word? Not common? 

""PULSE""? But U and P? And no A? We need A at position2? 

But then we would have A at2? So ""PALSE""? Not word? 

Now, the other case: A at position4? 
Then S must be at position2? Because if A at4, then S must be at2? (since S must be at2 or4? And 4 taken)

Pattern: ? S ? A E? 

And L must be at position1 or3? 

Then:
- If L at1: L S ? A E? 
  Example: ""L S ? A E"": ""LSOAE""? Not? 

  ""LSVAE""? Not? 

- If L at3: ? S L A E? 
  Example: ""USLAE""? Not? 

""MASLAE""? 

Perhaps Case 1 is more promising.

Also, we know L must be at1 or3? But if L is at3? And we put L at3? And S at2? And A at4? Then: ? S L A E? 

We need a word: ? S L A E? 

What? ""ISLAE""? But I is absent? 
""ASLAE"" -> but A at1? We haven't tried A at1? But in this case A at4? So if first letter is something? 
""USLAE"" not? 
""PSLAE"" not? 

But let's get back: perhaps we don't need to commit? Instead, test a word that covers multiple possibilities? 

But we want to verify A's position? 

In the third guess, we tried A at1 and got dash? Meaning A is not at1? And we know not at3? So only 2 and 4? 

To test A at4? We can use a word that puts A at4? 

But we also need S? And L? 

So let's try a word that has A at4? 

Example: ? ? ? A E? 

But we need to include S and L? And S must be at2? Because if S at4? Then conflict? Or S at2? And L at1 or3? 

Also, the word must have a fifth letter? 

Try: ? S ? A E? With L at position3: ? S L A E? 

Words: ""USLAE""? Not English? 

""ISLAE"" has I? Absent? 

Maybe ""BESLA"" doesn't end E? 

Not? 

Another idea: instead? If A at4? Then S at2? And L at1? Pattern: L S ? A E? 

What? ""LS __ A E""? 

Examples: ""L S I A E"" but I absent? 
""L S O A E""? Not word? 
""L S D A E""? 

Check dictionary: ""LASED""? L A S E D? Doesn't match? 

But ""LASED"" would be L A S E D? But then A at2? Not at4? 

So we need L at1, S at2, A at4? But that would be L S [something] A E? ""L S ? A E""? 

Like ""LSGAE""? Not word? 

Perhaps we try another arrangement? Maybe put L at position3? 

Pattern: ? S L A E? 

Again, ""USLAE"" not? 

Perhaps it is not working? So maybe A at2? 

Therefore, we guess with A at2? 

And we also have L at1? 

Then S at4? 

Then the word must be: L A ? S E? 

The fifth letter at position3? 

We can choose a common letter? Like O? Or U? 

""LOUSE""? But O? Then L O U S E? But that has L at1, O at2? But we want A at2? Not O? 

But A must be at2? So we have L at1 and A at2? Then ? at3 must be a letter? And S at4? E at5? 

Possible letters: let's try B? ""LABES""? But A? Then L A B E S? But S at5? And E at4? Not? Pattern L A [letter] S E? 

So ""L A B S E"" -> ""LABSE""? Not a word? 

""L A P S E"" -> ""LAPSE"" -> valid word? 

Yes, ""lapse"" means to fall into sin? 

So let's guess ""LAPSE"": 
  Position1: L? 
  Position2: A? 
  Position3: P? 
  Position4: S? 
  Position5: E? 

This tests:
- L at position1? We haven't tried? 
- A at position2? Untried? 
- S at position4? Untried? 
- P is a new letter?

And we avoid all absent letters? 

But what if A is actually at position4? Then we won't get it? 

But if we guess ""LAPSE"", and if A is at4? Then in feedback:
- Position1: L? We know L is present? But if not correct? It will be marked dash? 
- Position2: A? If the secret has A at4? Then A at2 would be dash? 
- Position4: S? Then if S is at4? Maybe? But we haven't tried? 
But also the fifth letter P? 

Alternatively, if we want to test A at position4? We can guess a word that puts A at4? But also includes L and S? And avoids conflict? 

But we don't know: so we take a risk? 

Given the feedback so far, ""LAPSE"" seems a good candidate? 

But also, note: the word must not have any letters we know are absent? ""LAPSE"" has L,A,P,S,E? No C,R,N,T,I? So okay? 

Alternatively, ""LEASE"" but no A? And we know A must be present? 

So we choose ""LAPSE""? 

But let's check if we missed any constraint? 
We have: 
- L at position1: possible? 
- A at position2: we haven't tried position2 for A? And we need to test? 
- P at position3: new letter? 
- S at position4: we haven't tried S at position4? 
- E at position5: known? 

Yes? 

So we guess ""LAPSE""?

#### Summary of Known Information:
1. **E** is firmly in position 5 (✓ in all guesses).
2. **Present letters (must be included)**:
   - **A**: In word, but eliminated from positions 1 (aisle), and 3 (crane and slate).
   - **S**: In word, but eliminated from positions 1 (slate) and 3 (aisle).
   - **L**: In word, but eliminated from positions 2 (slate) and 4 (aisle).
3. **Absent letters (cannot be used)**:
   - **C**, **R**, **N**, **T**, **I** (❌ in feedback).
4. **Constraints**:
   - **A** must be in position 2 or 4 (only untried positions left).
   - **S** must be in position 2 or 4 (only untried positions). However, **A** and **S** cannot occupy the same position.
   - **L** must be in position 1 or 3 (only untried positions).
   - The word must include one additional unknown letter (not tested yet).

#### Deductions:
- Since **L** must be at position 1 or 3, and **A**/**S** at 2 or 4, the only configuration that fits all constraints is:
  - **L** in position 1 (untried position).
  - **A** in position 2 (untried position).

#### Strategy for Guess:
- Test **L** at position 1, **A** at position 2, and **S** at position 4 to confirm their true positions.
- Introduce a common vowel/consonant for position 3 (e.g., **P**, **D**, **M**) to maximize information gain.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane""
 Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)

 Interpretation:
 - E is in the word and in the correct position (last letter). So the secret word ends with E.
 - A is in the word but not in the second position (since it's marked ""-"" meaning wrong position). So A is present, but elsewhere.
 - C, R, N are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word:
 - Must end with E: _ _ _ _ E
 - Contains the letter A, but not as the second letter (since in ""crane"", A was in position 2).
 - Does not contain C, R, N.

 Now, for the second guess, we want to:
 1. Try to place A in a different position (since it's not in position 2).
 2. Include other common letters that we haven't tried yet (excluding C, R, N).
 3. We know the last letter is E, so we keep that.

 Let's think of letters that are common and we haven't tried: 
 We have tried C, R, A, N, E. So avoid C, R, N. But we know A and E are present (E in the last spot, A somewhere else).

 We can use other vowels or common consonants: like S, T, L, I, O, B, D, G, H, K, M, P, U, etc.

 Also, we must avoid putting A in position 2 again (but it could be in position 1, 3, or 4).

 A good strategy is to use a word that has A in a new position (say position 1 or 3 or 4) and includes other new letters.

 Considering the feedback, the word must be of the form: [letter] [letter] [letter] [letter] E

 Since A is not in position 2, let's try putting A in position 1. Then the word would start with A.

 Also, we want to cover new letters. Let's try a word like ""ALIKE"", but note we haven't tried L, I, K.

 But wait: the last letter is E which we know. And we want to use the known E at the end.

 Potential word: ""ABUSE"" - but we don't know about B, U, S and it has A at position 1 and E at the end. However, note that in the first guess we had A at position 2 and it was present, so it's possible that A appears elsewhere and we don't know if it can be at start? Actually, we don't know yet. But we must not put A at position 2 because that was already tried and wrong position? Actually, the feedback only tells us that in the word ""crane"", A was in the word but not at the correct position. It might be that the correct position is position 1? We don't know until we try.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in a position we haven't tried: positions 1, 3, or 4.

 Let's list words that end with E and contain A and exclude C, R, N.

 Some options:

 - ""SAUTE"": S at start, A at position 2? But feedback told us that when A was in position 2 (in crane) it was present but wrong position. Now, if we put A in position 2 again? Actually, we can put A in position 2 again? But note: the feedback didn't say A cannot be in position 2, it said it is in the word but not in that position. So it could be that the word actually has A in a different position. However, if we put A in position 2 again and it still is not the correct position, then we know it must be placed elsewhere. But we want to maximize information. Maybe avoid position 2 for now until we test another position.

 So let's avoid position 2 for A for now.

 We can try:

 Position 1: A? => word pattern A _ _ _ E
 Examples: ABASE, ABATE, ADAGE, AGATE, ALATE, ALIKE, ALONE? (note: avoid N -> so no ALONE). 

 But note: we don't know if A is at position 1. It could be at position 3 or 4.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in position 3 or 4.

 Also, we need to include other new letters.

 Common letters: Let's try S, T, L, I, O, etc.

 After excluding C, R, N, we are left with many. What about:

 - ""PLATE"": P L A T E -> but we know E is at end? Yes. And A is at position 3? That's a new position. Also, we test P, L, T.

 However, note: the feedback for our first guess (crane) had A at position 2 being present but wrong. Now in ""PLATE"", A is at position 3. It might be that the correct position for A is 3? Not necessarily, it could be 1 or 4. But at least we test position 3.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"": S L A T E -> but that has A at position 3 again.

 But note: we don't know if S, L, T are in the word. We haven't tested them.

 Another idea: if we use a word with A at position 1, we can also test other common letters.

 Let me choose ""ADIEU"" but note: it ends with U, not E. We need E at the end.

 Wait, we must have E at the end. So we need a word that ends with E and has A and doesn't use C, R, N.

 Also, note we are not forced to include A. But we know A is in the word, so we should include it.

 Let me choose ""SAUTE"": S A U T E -> but that has A at position 2. We are unsure about position 2? We know from feedback that A is not in position 2? Actually, the feedback only says A is in the word but not at position 2. So it could be in the word at position 1, 3 or 4? However, note: the feedback does not preclude that position 2 might be A? Wait, no: if the secret word had A in position 2, then when we guessed ""crane"" with A in position 2, it would have been marked with a check. Since it was not, we know A is not in position 2. Therefore, we must avoid putting A in position 2? Or we can put it but we already know it's wrong? Actually, we can put it again to confirm? But that might be a waste. Better to test a different position.

 So let's choose a word with A in position 1: Examples:

 - ""ABASE"": A B A S E -> but note, repeated A. We haven't tested B and S. However, it's valid. But with repeated letters? We don't know if the word has repeated letters. It's possible.

 Feedback: we know A is in the word, but if the secret word has two A's? Our feedback for ""crane"" didn't indicate that. But note: when we guessed ""crane"", we only had one A and it was marked present. That doesn't rule out two A's.

 However, let's avoid repetition for now.

 Let me choose ""AGAPE"": but again two A's? 

 Or ""ADOBE"": no C,R,N? A D O B E -> O and B are new? And A at position 1? That's valid.

 But ""ADOBE"" ends with E? Yes.

 Alternatively, ""ALIKE"": A L I K E -> A at 1, and ends with E? Yes.

 Let's go with ""ALIKE"": we test A in position 1 and new letters L, I, K.

 But note: we know the word has E at the end and we have E in position 5 again? Actually, in feedback we already know E is at position 5. But guessing a word with E at position 5 again is fine because we can confirm and also test the rest.

 However, in position 1 we put A. We don't know if A should be at position 1 or not.

 Also, we are testing L, I, K.

 Alternatively, we can also try ""STALE"": S T A L E -> A at position 3? That's a new position. And S, T, L are new.

 Since we don't know where A is, testing position 3 is as good as position 1? Actually, we are testing two possibilities: position 1 and position 3. We can do either.

 I think ""STALE"" is a good candidate because S, T, L are common letters and A is at position 3 (which we haven't tried). But what if the A is actually at position 1? Then we won't test that. So maybe ""ATONE"" -> but avoids N? We can't use N? Because we know N is not in the word? Actually, the feedback said N was not present? So N is absent.

 So we cannot use N. Therefore, ""ATONE"" is invalid because it has N.

 How about ""STAGE"": S T A G E -> A at position 3? Then we test S, T, G.

 That's also good.

 Another option: ""SLATE"" -> S L A T E -> A at position 3? S, L, T.

 I think ""SLATE"" is a common word.

 But note: the feedback says we have E at the end. So we know that. We don't need to change the E.

 However, in ""SLATE"": 
   Position 1: S -> not tested before.
   Position 2: L -> not tested.
   Position 3: A -> we know A is in the word, here it's placed in a new position (3). 
   Position 4: T -> not tested.
   Position 5: E -> already known.

 This word gives us information for S, L, T and checks A in position 3.

 Also, note: we don't use any forbidden letters (C, R, N).

 Alternatively, we can choose ""SAUCE"" -> but C is forbidden? We know C is not in the word? Actually, feedback said C(x). So avoid C.

 So ""SLATE"" seems good.

 What about ""PLATE""? P L A T E -> covers P, L, T. Also A at position 3.

 I don't see a strong preference. But let's go with ""SLATE"" because it uses more common letters? T is more common than P.

 Actually, yes. So we choose ""SLATE"".

 But wait: we have the possibility that A could be at position 1? But by putting it at position 3, if it gets marked as absent then we know it must be at position 4? Actually, no: the feedback will tell us for A if it's present and if so what position.

 Because the feedback per letter will tell us:

 - If A in SLATE (position 3) gets a ✓, then we know A is at position 3.
 - If A gets a '-', then we know A is present but not at 3 -> meaning it must be at position 1 or 4? 
 - But note: if A is at position 1 and we put it at position 3, it would be marked with a '-' meaning it's present elsewhere.

 So we can get information about the position of A.

 Similarly, by testing S, L, T we get information.

 So let's guess ""SLATE"".

<guess>slate</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **E(✓)** confirms that the secret word ends with `E`.
- **A(-)** means the letter `A` is in the word but not in position 2.
- **C(x)**, **R(x)**, and **N(x)** indicate these letters are not in the word.

For the second guess:
- The word must end with `E` (position 5).
- It must include `A` but avoid position 2 (since position 2 was incorrect for `A`).
- We cannot use `C`, `R`, or `N`.
- New letters should be tested to gather more information, focusing on common consonants like `S`, `L`, and `T`.

I selected **slate** as the guess:
- Positions: `S` (test position 1), `L` (test position 2), `A` (test position 3, avoiding position 2), `T` (test position 4), `E` (confirmed position 5).
- This tests `A` in a new position (3) and introduces `S`, `L`, and `T`—frequent letters not yet evaluated.

<guess>slate</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two sets of feedback:

First guess: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
This tells us:
- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th).
- A is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
- C, R, N are not in the word.

Second guess: slate -> S(-) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(✓)
This tells us:
- E is again confirmed in the 5th position (we already knew this).
- S, L, A are all present but none of them are in the correct position in ""slate"".
  Specifically:
    S is not in position 1
    L is not in position 2
    A is not in position 3
- T is not in the word at all.

Additionally, we know:
- The word ends with E: ? ? ? ? E
- A is in the word, but not in positions 2 (from first guess) and not in position 3 (from second guess). Therefore, A must be in position 1 or 4.
- The absent letters are: C, R, N, T.
- Present letters: E (position 5), A, S, L. And we have tested A, S, L without knowing their exact positions.

Now, we need to form a new guess that:
- Does not contain C, R, N, T (eliminated).
- Must include S, L, A (because they are present) and of course E at the end.
- But note: we must not place S in position 1 (because slate had S in 1 and got a dash meaning incorrect position), L not in position 2, and A not in position 3.
- Also, since A can only be in position 1 or 4 (because positions 2 and 3 are now ruled out), we need to test A in one of these positions.

Possible positions for the known letters:
- Position 1: Could be A or S? But S was in position 1 and got a dash, meaning S is not in position 1, but it is in the word. So S might be in 2,3,4? Similarly, L is not in 2, and A is not in 2 or 3.

Since A must be in position 1 or 4, let's consider trying A in position 1 in this guess.

Also, we need to place S and L in positions where we have not ruled them out. For S: we tried position 1 and it was wrong -> S must be in 2,3 or 4? But wait, we have slot 2,3,4 available. Similarly L: we tried position 2 which was wrong, so L must be in 1,3,4 -> but position 1 might be taken by A? So we consider.

But note: in the second guess, slate had:
  pos1: S (not correct, but present) -> so S is in the word, just not at 1 -> thus S must be at 2,3, or 4.
  pos2: L (not correct, but present) -> L must be at 1,3, or 4.

However, if we try A at position 1, then we cannot put L at 1 (same position). Similarly, S cannot go to 1.

So the letters we must place: A, S, L and the last is E known. Plus we need one more letter.

The format: _ _ _ _ E

We are missing the 4th letter? Wait, we have four positions: 1,2,3,4. We know E is at 5.

We know the word has S, L, A, E and one more letter? Because so far we have found 4 letters: A, S, L, E? But our feedback only guaranteed A, S, L, E are present. However, we haven't tested all letters. There must be one more letter in position 3 or somewhere? Actually, the word has 5 letters. We only know 4: A, S, L, E? Or perhaps there are 5 distinct letters? The feedback doesn't rule out duplicates, but we haven't seen any duplicates. Let's proceed.

We need a fifth letter that is not C, R, N, T (because these are absent). And we don't know about other letters.

For the new guess, we must form a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (position 5).
- Contains A, S, L, and E (with E fixed at position 5).
- Does not contain C, R, N, T.
- And we must avoid putting A in position 2 or 3 (already tried) -> so only position 1 or 4 for A.
- Also avoid S in position 1 (because that was tried) -> S can only be in 2,3,4.
- Avoid L in position 2 -> L can be in 1,3,4.

But if we put A in position 1, then position 1 is occupied. Then S cannot be in 1? But we already avoid S in 1 so that's ok. Similarly, L cannot be in 1 because A is there? Then L must go to 3 or 4.

Similarly, if we put A in position 4, then position 4 is occupied.

Let's try to build with A in position 1:

So: A _ _ _ E

Now, we must assign S and L to positions 2,3,4? But without putting S at 1 (which we avoid) and L not in 2? So:

- Position 2: cannot put L (because L was in position 2 and got a dash? Actually, we know L is not at position 2). So we can put S in position 2? Because S could be at 2? Then L must be placed in position 3 or 4? And we have position 3 open?

Actually, the positions we have to assign to S: only 2,3,4? But we can put S in 2? Similarly L in 3 or 4? But note: the word must be valid.

Alternatively, A in position 4:

Then: _ _ _ A E

Now, assign S and L: S cannot be in 1? So S in position 2 or 3? L can be in position 1,3? But wait: position 1 is free? And L can be in position 1? Then we can have L at 1 and then S at 2 or 3? Also note: L was not tried in position 1? And S not tried in 2 or 3? So that's possible.

But we don't know which scenario (A at 1 or A at 4) is correct. We want to test A at 1? Then we should set A at 1 in this guess? Then we can get immediate feedback on A's position.

So let me try A in position 1.

Thus: A ? ? ? E

We need to assign S and L: and one more letter? Because we have three positions: 2,3,4.

The known letters we have to place: S and L. Then the fourth letter (for slot 2,3,4) must be an unknown letter? Actually, we have four letters: A, E, S, L. So the fifth letter is missing? Therefore the word has at least these four, but we need a fifth.

We have to choose one more letter (not C,R,N,T) and put it in one of the spots? And then assign S and L to the other two?

Also, we must not put S in position 1? But we are not putting S in 1 because we have A. Similarly L not in 2? So we can:

Option: put S in position 2? Then we must put L in position 3 or 4? And the remaining position (either 3 or 4) for a new letter.

But note: if we put S in 2, that's a new position? We don't know about position 2 for S? Similarly, L in 3: we haven't tried L in 3? Position 4? Also.

But we know L was tried in position 2 and was wrong? But we can try L in 3 or 4.

Similarly, we can avoid position 2 for L? That is, we know L cannot be at 2? So in this guess, we don't put L at 2? Which is okay.

Similarly, S cannot be at 1? But we are putting S at 2? So:

Position 1: A
Position 2: S? 
Position 3: ? 
Position 4: ? 
Position 5: E

And L must go to position 3 or 4? And the other position is a new letter.

But we must avoid any letter that we know is absent? Not just C,R,N,T? But we haven't tested many.

Alternatively, since A is at 1, and we need a word that works.

Common words: 
- Consider ""AISLE"": A I S L E -> E at end? Yes. 
But check: 
  Position 1: A -> we are testing A at 1? So it might be correct? 
  Position 2: I -> new letter.
  Position 3: S -> we haven't tried S in 3? 
  Position 4: L -> L in position 4? 
  Position 5: E.

And the letters: A,I,S,L,E. 
Absent letters we know: C,R,N,T -> I is not eliminated? Okay.

But note: feedback for A in the second guess was dash? But that's because it was at position 3? Now we are moving A to position 1? So it might be correct? We don't know.

But let's check if it violates any known restrictions:
- We don't put S in 1? Here S is at position 3? So okay.
- We don't put L in position 2? Here L is at position 4? Okay.
- A is at position 1? We hope to get feedback if it's correct.

But what about S? We have S in the word? Yes. And we are placing S at position 3? Which we haven't tried? 

But note: we have two possibilities for S: it might be at 2,3,4? We are testing 3.

Similarly, L: we are testing at position 4? And we haven't tried position 4 for L? 

Also, we are testing I? So getting I tested is good.

However, wait: the word ""AISLE""? We have previously tested A and we know it is present? But now we are putting A at position 1? If the secret word has A at 4? Then in this guess: A at position 1 would be marked as not correct (since it should be at 4)? I.e., a dash? So we learn.

But note: we also have to consider that there might be a duplicate? But let's try.

Another word with A at 1: ""ALOSE""? Is it valid? ALOSE? Not common. Better use ""ABUSE""? But we don't know B and we have U to test? But ""ABUSE"" uses B and U? And note: we must not use T (which we know is absent)? So B and U are possible.

But ""ABUSE"": A B U S E -> S is at position 4? Then L is missing? But our feedback says L is present? Oh wait: we know L is present? Because in ""slate"", L was at position 2 and marked dash? So L must be in the word? Therefore we must include L? Because when a letter gets a dash or check, it means it is in the word? Yes.

Therefore, we cannot ignore L? Our guess must include L? Because we know L is present? So guess must contain S, L, A, E (and one more letter).

So in ""AISLE"", we have: A, I, S, L, E -> so L is included? at position 4. So it's valid.

Similarly, what about ""ALL SE""? But repeated L? We don't know if duplicates? So let's try ""AISLE"".

But note: we have two scenarios:

If the secret word has A at position 1, then ""AISLE"" with A at 1 might be correct? But we don't know.

If the secret has A at position 4, then A at 1 in ""AISLE"" would be marked as not correct? And we would see dash for A? Then we learn A is at 4? But then we have L at 4? And if we put L at 4? Wait no: in ""AISLE"", A is at 1 and L at 4? So if A is actually at 4? Then L at 4 would be wrong? Actually, no: because A at 4, then L must be elsewhere? But we don't know.

Alternatively, let's consider: instead of testing A at 1, we test A at 4? Then we could learn more? 

Consider: A at position 4.

Then: _ _ _ A E

We must assign S and L? And one other letter? Without putting S at 1, L not at 2? And S not at 1? 

Options:

Position 1: can put L? Because L was at position 2 and wasn't correct? So we haven't tried L at 1? So let Position 1: L? Then Position 2: must not be L? So put S at 3? Position 3? Or put Position 2: S? But S hasn't been tried at position 2? 

But note: if we put L at 1: ? L ? ? E but the word is L ? ? A E

Then we can:

Position 1: L? 
Position 2: we can try a new letter? But S cannot be at 1? But we put L at 1? So S must be at position 3? Because if we put S at 2? Then S at position 2? We haven't tried S at 2. Similarly, position 3 is free? 

Also, we have position 3 and 2 available? 

What word: ""C ?"" ... but without C. 

Word like ""LEASE""? But has E in position 1? Actually, no: we are putting L at position 1? Then we need S somewhere? And A at 4.

""LEAVE""? L E A V E? But we don't know V? And also, A at 3? Then E? But E is already in position 5? And we have E at 2? But the word has two E's? Possible.

But note: ""LEAVE"" has E at position 2? And 5? And A at position 3? Then we have:

Positions: 1:L, 2:E, 3:A, 4:V, 5:E? But we know E is at 5? And we haven't tested V? But also, we are missing S? Because S must be in the word? But ""LEAVE"" has L,E,A,V,E? No S? We cannot skip S? So discard.

We need a word that includes S? So:

What about ""LOSES""? But fails: S repeated? And not starting? But we need L and A and S. And E at the end.

""LASED""? L A S E D? But E is at position 4? And we require E at 5? And we have to have E at 5? So not valid.

We need E at the end? So ? ? ? A E

With letters L, S, and one more? And E at the end? So the word must be: ? ? ? A E

Where we put L at 1? Then we need S? And another letter? And avoid T,C,R,N.

""LUCRE""? But C? Not allowed.

""LAPSE"": L A P S E -> but positions:
  1: L? 
  2: A? but we know A cannot be at position 2 (from first feedback)? Because ""crane"" had A at 2 and it got dash? Meaning A is in the word but not at position 2? So A at position 2 in this guess wouldn't be correct? Hence, we should avoid? 

But in ""lapse"", if we put A at 2? Then we are putting A in a known wrong position? That gives no new information? 

Actually, we cannot put A at 2? Because we know A is not at position 2? So the word must not have A at 2? But we are trying to put A at position 4? In this scenario. 

Wait, no: if we are testing A at position 4? Then in ""lapse"", A is at position 2? So we must not choose that.

So we want a word that has A at position 4? Then the pattern: ? ? ? A E

And we can put L at position 1? Then the next positions: 2 and 3: we assign one to S and another to a new letter? Without S at 1? And without L at 2? 

But position 2: what? We can put a new letter? Then position 3: S? And A at 4? 

Word: L ? S A E ? 

What can go in position 2? 

Examples: ""LIBRA""? But R? Absent? And not ending E? 

""LIASE""? Is that word? No.

""LEASE"": L E A S E? But A at position 3, not 4? Pattern: L E A S E -> then A at 3? And S at 4? And E at 5? But wait: we are trying to put A at 4? So wrong.

But we want A at position 4? So the word must have the fourth letter A? And then E at 5? And L at 1? Then position 2 and 3: can be S and a new letter? Or vice versa? 

Word: ? ? ? A E with L at 1:  L ? ? A E

Then position 2: we can put any that is not T,C,R,N? And S must be in the word? So we can put S at position 2: then L S ? A E -> what can be in position 3? It must be a letter? Words like: ""LYASE""? But not common.

""LASSO"" but ends O? No.

""LASED""? But E is not at 4? And we need E at end? So L ? ? A E -> that's five letters? So positions: L, x, y, A, E

What words: ""LUMPS""? doesn't have A? Not.

""LAPJE""? Not English.

""LATKE"" but T is absent? T is eliminated? 

Perhaps it's easier to test A at position 1? 

Therefore, I return to testing A at 1? And include L and S? And a new letter.

So pattern: A ? ? ? E

With S present? (must not be in 1? We put at 2,3,4) 
L present? (must not be in 2? We put at 3 or 4)

And we have to fill two positions? For example, put S at position 2? Then L at position 3? And what at 4? A new letter? 

Word: A S L ? E? Like ""ASLIE""? Not word.

Or A ? L ? E? With S at position 4: A ? L S E? 

Examples: ""ABULSE"" has extra letters.

Or ""AISLE"": A I S L E

Again: positions: A at1, I at2, S at3, L at4, E at5? 

Yes, ""aisle"" is a word and it meets:

- A at 1? Testing that.
- I is new? 
- S at 3? New position? 
- L at 4? New position? And E at5? known.
- Letters: so we test I? Which is good.

Alternatively ""AMBLE""? But M? And L at position 4? Similarly.

Another option: ""Apses""? But S repeated? And E at5? Not.

I think ""AISLE"" is a good candidate.

But we also consider ""ABASE"": A B A S E? Repeated A? Also not include L? But we must include L? So ignore.

Another: ""ALWAYS""? But Y? And no S? And not ends E? 

So better ""AISLE""

But what about ""AISLES""? Too long? 

No, we need 5-letter word: ""AISLE"" is 5.

So we go with ""AISLE"": 

  A in position 1 -> we see if it's correct? 
  I in position 2 -> check if new letter present?
  S in position 3 -> check correct?
  L in position 4 -> check correct?
  E in position 5 -> known.

And avoid C,R,N,T? Yes, ""AISLE"" doesn't have any of these.

So let's guess ""AISLE""

- **E**: ✓ (confirmed position 5)

#### Key Deductions:
1. The word ends with **E** (position 5).
2. **A**, **S**, and **L** are in the word, but:
   - **A** is not in positions 2 or 3 (eliminated).
   - **S** is not in position 1 (eliminated).
   - **L** is not in position 2 (eliminated).
3. Absent letters: **C**, **R**, **N**, **T** (cannot be used).
4. **A** must be in position 1 or 4 (only remaining positions).
5. **S** must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
6. **L** must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

For this guess:
- Test **A** at position 1 (since position 4 remains untested and could be validated later).
- Place **S** and **L** in new positions to maximize information:
  - **S** cannot be in position 1→ placed at position 3.
  - **L** cannot be in position 2→ placed at position 4.
- Introduce a new letter **I** at position 2 to test for presence.
- Structure: **A** (position 1), **I** (position 2), **S** (position 3), **L** (position 4), **E** (position 5).

The word **aisle** fits all constraints:
- Contains **A**, **S**, **L**, and **E**.
- Avoids forbidden letters (**C**, **R**, **N**, **T**).
- Tests **A** at position 1 and new positions for **S** and **L**.

<guess>aisle</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: aisle -> FEEDBACK: A(-) I(x) S(-) L(-) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We now have feedback from the third guess: ""aisle"" -> A(-) I(x) S(-) L(-) E(✓)

Let's recap all feedback so far:

**From guess 1 (crane):**
- C: absent (x)
- R: absent (x)
- A: present, but not in position 2 (rightmost hint shows positions: crane is c(1), r(2), a(3), n(4), e(5)? Actually, in ""crane"", A is at position 3? Wait, no: positions: 
  Position 1: C -> x
  Position 2: R -> x
  Position 3: A -> present but wrong position? The user feedback: ""A(-)"" and it was the third letter? In the input ""crane"", the third letter is A? So A was in position 3? And marked with (-), meaning A is in the word but not in position 3?

Wait, the feedback format: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
So this corresponds to:
- Position 1: C (x)
- Position 2: R (x)
- Position 3: A (-) -> so A is in word, not at pos 3
- Position 4: N (x)
- Position 5: E (✓)

Similarly, guess 2: slate -> 
- Position 1: S (-)
- Position 2: L (-)
- Position 3: A (-)
- Position 4: T (x)
- Position 5: E (✓)

Guess 3: aisle ->
- Position 1: A (-)
- Position 2: I (x)
- Position 3: S (-)
- Position 4: L (-)
- Position 5: E (✓)

So absolute knowns:
1. E is fixed at position 5: ???E? -> now the word ends with E. The pattern is [1][2][3][4]E

2. A is present, but we now know:
- From guess 1: not at position 3 (since in crane, A at pos3 marked -)
- From guess 2: not at position 3 again? But already known? No new info. Actually, guess2 also had A at pos3? And it was marked - again? 
- From guess 3: not at position 1 (since in aisle, A at pos1 marked -)

Therefore, A must be at position 4? Because positions: 1 (eliminated by guess3), 2 (eliminated by guess1? Actually no: guess1 only said A not at pos3? Wait, guess1: A was at pos3 and got dash? That only eliminates pos3? Similarly, guess2: A at pos3 again? Same. Guess3: A at pos1 -> dash? Eliminates pos1. So the only position left is position 4? Or position 2? But wait: we don't have any feedback that A is not at position 2? 

How about the position 2? 
In guess1: we tried R at position 2 and got x? That means R is absent, but doesn't say about A? 
In guess2: we tried L at position 2 and got dash? That means L is present but not at position 2? Doesn't say anything about A? 
We never tried A at position 2? So it might be possible? 

So A could be at position 2 or 4? 
But wait: in guess1: we didn't try position2 for A? In guess1, position2 was R? 
In guess2: position2 was L? 
In guess3: position1 was A? 

So A has not been tried at position 2? So position 2 remains a possibility? Also position 4? 

But in the word, the positions are 1-5? 
We eliminated position 1 (by guess3)? 
We eliminated position 3 (by guess1 and 2)? 
Position 5 is E? So only position 2 or 4 for A? 

So A must be at position 2 or 4? 

3. S is present:
- From guess2: not at position 1 (marked dash at pos1 when guessed in slate)
- From guess3: not at position 3 (marked dash at pos3 when guessed in aisle)
- Also, what about position 4? We haven't tried position 4 for S? 
  So S could be at position 2, or 4? 

4. L is present:
- From guess2: not at position 2 (marked dash at pos2 in slate)
- From guess3: not at position 4 (marked dash at pos4 in aisle) -> because in aisle, L at pos4 got dash? 
  Also, we tried L at position 4? And it was present but wrong position? So L is not at position 4? 
  But could L be at position 1? Or 3? 
  Positions: we have not tried L at position 1 or 3? 
  Because: 
    In guess2: L was at position 2 -> eliminated
    In guess3: L was at position 4 -> eliminated
  So L must be at position 1 or 3? 

5. I is absent? (guess3: I at position2 marked x? So I is not in the word? 

6. T is absent (already known from guess2)

7. C, R, N are absent.

Now, we know the word has: A, S, L, E? But must have one more letter? Since 5 letters? So we need a fifth letter? Which we haven't found? We have tested E, A, S, L? But we tested other letters? We tested C,R,N,T,I? Absent? So more letters to guess? 

Also, we haven't tested many consonants? And the fifth letter might be one that hasn't been tested? 

Now, let's organize the possibilities:

Position 1: Could be L? (since L must be at 1 or 3) or could be the fifth letter? But we have A, S, L to place? 

But note: positions: 
We know A must be at 2 or 4? 
S must be at 2 or 4? But if A and S are both at 2 or 4? They might conflict? 

Also, L must be at 1 or 3? 

And we know E at 5? 

So the pattern is: 

If A at position 2 and S at position 4? Then pattern: [L? at1 or3] A [L? at3 or what?] and S at4? 

But note: position3 might have L? Or the fifth letter?

Similarly, if A at4 and S at2? Then: [L? at1 or3] S [L? or other] A E? 

So we should pick a guess that uses only the known present letters? And one new letter? Also avoiding absent letters? But what new letter to choose? 

But we must include all known present letters? So we know A, S, L, E are present? So the fifth letter is missing? Which one is it? 

So we must form a word with A, S, L, E, and one other letter? (not C, R, N, T, I)

Possible? 

Also, the positions: 
- L must be at 1 or 3?
- A must be at 2 or 4?
- S must be at 2 or 4? 
- E at 5.

But if L is at position 1? Then the word starts with L? 
Then position 2: must be A? Or S? Or the new letter? 
But A and S need to be at 2 or 4? 

Similarly, position 4: must be A or S? 

Case 1: Assume A at position 2? Then S must be at position 4? 
Then pattern: L A ? S E? Because position1: L? position2: A? position4: S? position5: E? 
Then position3: must be the fifth letter.

But L at1? Yes? 
A at2? 
S at4? 
E at5? 
So we get: L A ? S E? 

Then we need a word: L A ? S E? 

What could be at position3? Letters not eliminated: we haven't tested any? We tried: C,R,N,T,I? Absent? 
Possible letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? 

But common? For example, ""LEASE"" but then missing A? No? 

Try: ""LASES""? But S repeated? And L A S E S? But then S at position3 and also at4? Also E at5? So ""LASES""? But that's L A S E S -> but pattern L A S? E? S? But we know S at position4? So if ""LASES"" -> positions: 
1:L, 2:A, 3:S, 4:E, 5:S -> but S at3? We don't know? But we fixed A at2 and S at4? And E at5? But in this pattern we have S at3? So if we want S at4? Then we cannot have S at3? 

And ""LASES"" doesn't match because we put E at4? But we want E at5? And S at4? 

So the word would be: L A ? S E? 
With ? being a letter? And it can't be E? But the fifth letter? 

Example: ""LAZES""? L A Z E S? But then S at5? Not? 

Needs to be L A [letter] S E? 

""LAPSE""? But P? Then: L A P S E? 
Then positions: 
1:L, 2:A, 3:P, 4:S, 5:E? 

Then we could have A at2? S at4? So it satisfies? 

Is ""LAPSE"" a word? Yes? 

But note: we also have the possibility that A at4? 

But first we try Case 1: A at2? and S at4? ""LAPSE"" has that? 

But wait: what about L? In our scenario, we have L at1? Which is okay? 

Alternatively, if L is at position 3? Then pattern: ? ? L ? E? 

And if A at2? Then: ? A L ? E? But S must be at4? Then: ? A L S E? 

Then position1: must be a letter? 

Example: ""HALSE""? H A L S E? 

But is that a word? Not common? 

""PULSE""? But U and P? And no A? We need A at position2? 

But then we would have A at2? So ""PALSE""? Not word? 

Now, the other case: A at position4? 
Then S must be at position2? Because if A at4, then S must be at2? (since S must be at2 or4? And 4 taken)

Pattern: ? S ? A E? 

And L must be at position1 or3? 

Then:
- If L at1: L S ? A E? 
  Example: ""L S ? A E"": ""LSOAE""? Not? 

  ""LSVAE""? Not? 

- If L at3: ? S L A E? 
  Example: ""USLAE""? Not? 

""MASLAE""? 

Perhaps Case 1 is more promising.

Also, we know L must be at1 or3? But if L is at3? And we put L at3? And S at2? And A at4? Then: ? S L A E? 

We need a word: ? S L A E? 

What? ""ISLAE""? But I is absent? 
""ASLAE"" -> but A at1? We haven't tried A at1? But in this case A at4? So if first letter is something? 
""USLAE"" not? 
""PSLAE"" not? 

But let's get back: perhaps we don't need to commit? Instead, test a word that covers multiple possibilities? 

But we want to verify A's position? 

In the third guess, we tried A at1 and got dash? Meaning A is not at1? And we know not at3? So only 2 and 4? 

To test A at4? We can use a word that puts A at4? 

But we also need S? And L? 

So let's try a word that has A at4? 

Example: ? ? ? A E? 

But we need to include S and L? And S must be at2? Because if S at4? Then conflict? Or S at2? And L at1 or3? 

Also, the word must have a fifth letter? 

Try: ? S ? A E? With L at position3: ? S L A E? 

Words: ""USLAE""? Not English? 

""ISLAE"" has I? Absent? 

Maybe ""BESLA"" doesn't end E? 

Not? 

Another idea: instead? If A at4? Then S at2? And L at1? Pattern: L S ? A E? 

What? ""LS __ A E""? 

Examples: ""L S I A E"" but I absent? 
""L S O A E""? Not word? 
""L S D A E""? 

Check dictionary: ""LASED""? L A S E D? Doesn't match? 

But ""LASED"" would be L A S E D? But then A at2? Not at4? 

So we need L at1, S at2, A at4? But that would be L S [something] A E? ""L S ? A E""? 

Like ""LSGAE""? Not word? 

Perhaps we try another arrangement? Maybe put L at position3? 

Pattern: ? S L A E? 

Again, ""USLAE"" not? 

Perhaps it is not working? So maybe A at2? 

Therefore, we guess with A at2? 

And we also have L at1? 

Then S at4? 

Then the word must be: L A ? S E? 

The fifth letter at position3? 

We can choose a common letter? Like O? Or U? 

""LOUSE""? But O? Then L O U S E? But that has L at1, O at2? But we want A at2? Not O? 

But A must be at2? So we have L at1 and A at2? Then ? at3 must be a letter? And S at4? E at5? 

Possible letters: let's try B? ""LABES""? But A? Then L A B E S? But S at5? And E at4? Not? Pattern L A [letter] S E? 

So ""L A B S E"" -> ""LABSE""? Not a word? 

""L A P S E"" -> ""LAPSE"" -> valid word? 

Yes, ""lapse"" means to fall into sin? 

So let's guess ""LAPSE"": 
  Position1: L? 
  Position2: A? 
  Position3: P? 
  Position4: S? 
  Position5: E? 

This tests:
- L at position1? We haven't tried? 
- A at position2? Untried? 
- S at position4? Untried? 
- P is a new letter?

And we avoid all absent letters? 

But what if A is actually at position4? Then we won't get it? 

But if we guess ""LAPSE"", and if A is at4? Then in feedback:
- Position1: L? We know L is present? But if not correct? It will be marked dash? 
- Position2: A? If the secret has A at4? Then A at2 would be dash? 
- Position4: S? Then if S is at4? Maybe? But we haven't tried? 
But also the fifth letter P? 

Alternatively, if we want to test A at position4? We can guess a word that puts A at4? But also includes L and S? And avoids conflict? 

But we don't know: so we take a risk? 

Given the feedback so far, ""LAPSE"" seems a good candidate? 

But also, note: the word must not have any letters we know are absent? ""LAPSE"" has L,A,P,S,E? No C,R,N,T,I? So okay? 

Alternatively, ""LEASE"" but no A? And we know A must be present? 

So we choose ""LAPSE""? 

But let's check if we missed any constraint? 
We have: 
- L at position1: possible? 
- A at position2: we haven't tried position2 for A? And we need to test? 
- P at position3: new letter? 
- S at position4: we haven't tried S at position4? 
- E at position5: known? 

Yes? 

So we guess ""LAPSE""? 

<guess>lapse</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:

#### Summary of Known Information:
1. **E** is firmly in position 5 (✓ in all guesses).
2. **Present letters (must be included)**:
   - **A**: In word, but eliminated from positions 1 (aisle), and 3 (crane and slate).
   - **S**: In word, but eliminated from positions 1 (slate) and 3 (aisle).
   - **L**: In word, but eliminated from positions 2 (slate) and 4 (aisle).
3. **Absent letters (cannot be used)**:
   - **C**, **R**, **N**, **T**, **I** (❌ in feedback).
4. **Constraints**:
   - **A** must be in position 2 or 4 (only untried positions left).
   - **S** must be in position 2 or 4 (only untried positions). However, **A** and **S** cannot occupy the same position.
   - **L** must be in position 1 or 3 (only untried positions).
   - The word must include one additional unknown letter (not tested yet).

#### Deductions:
- Since **L** must be at position 1 or 3, and **A**/**S** at 2 or 4, the only configuration that fits all constraints is:
  - **L** in position 1 (untried position).
  - **A** in position 2 (untried position).
  - Unknown letter in position 3.
  - **S** in position 4 (untried position).
  - **E** in position 5.
- This pattern forms **L A ? S E**, where ""?"" is a new letter not yet tested (and not **C, R, N, T, I**).

#### Strategy for Guess:
- Test **L** at position 1, **A** at position 2, and **S** at position 4 to confirm their true positions.
- Introduce a common vowel/consonant for position 3 (e.g., **P**, **D**, **M**) to maximize information gain.
- **Lapse**:
  - Fits the pattern: **L(1)**, **A(2)**, **P(3)**, **S(4)**, **E(5)**.
  - Tests all remaining constraints:
    - **L** at position 1 (pass/fail reveals correctness).
    - **A** at position 2 (direct test).
    - **S** at position 4 (direct test).
  - Introduces **P** (new letter, not eliminated).

So the secret word ends with E.\n - A is in the word but not in the second position (since it\'s marked ""-"" meaning wrong position).

Then the word would start with A.\n\n Also, we want to cover new letters. Let\'s try a word like ""ALIKE"", but note we haven\'t tried L, I, K.\n\n But wait: the last letter is E which we know. And we want to use the known E at the end.\n\n Potential word: ""ABUSE"" - but we don\'t know about B, U, S and it has A at position 1 and E at the end. However, note that in the first guess we had A at position 2 and it was present, so it\'s possible that A appears elsewhere and we don\'t know if it can be at start? Actually, we don\'t know yet. But we must not put A at position 2 because that was already tried and wrong position? Actually, the feedback only tells us that in the word ""crane"", A was in the word but not at the correct position. It might be that the correct position is position 1? We don\'t know until we try.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in a position we haven\'t tried: positions 1, 3, or 4.\n\n Let\'s list words that end with E and contain A and exclude C, R, N.\n\n Some options:\n\n - ""SAUTE"": S at start, A at position 2? But feedback told us that when A was in position 2 (in crane) it was present but wrong position. Now, if we put A in position 2 again? Actually, we can put A in position 2 again? But note: the feedback didn\'t say A cannot be in position 2, it said it is in the word but not in that position. So it could be that the word actually has A in a different position. However, if we put A in position 2 again and it still is not the correct position, then we know it must be placed elsewhere. But we want to maximize information. Maybe avoid position 2 for now until we test another position.\n\n So let\'s avoid position 2 for A for now.\n\n We can try:\n\n Position 1: A? => word pattern A _ _ _ E\n Examples: ABASE, ABATE, ADAGE, AGATE, ALATE, ALIKE, ALONE? (note: avoid N -> so no ALONE). \n\n But note: we don\'t know if A is at position 1. It could be at position 3 or 4.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in position 3 or 4.\n\n Also, we need to include other new letters.\n\n Common letters: Let\'s try S, T, L, I, O, etc.\n\n After excluding C, R, N, we are left with many. What about:\n\n - ""PLATE"": P L A T E -> but we know E is at end? Yes. And A is at position 3? That\'s a new position. Also, we test P, L, T.\n\n However, note: the feedback for our first guess (crane) had A at position 2 being present but wrong. Now in ""PLATE"", A is at position 3. It might be that the correct position for A is 3? Not necessarily, it could be 1 or 4. But at least we test position 3.\n\n Alternatively, ""SLATE"": S L A T E -> but that has A at position 3 again.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if S, L, T are in the word. We haven\'t tested them.\n\n Another idea: if we use a word with A at position 1, we can also test other common letters.\n\n Let me choose ""ADIEU"" but note: it ends with U, not E. We need E at the end.\n\n Wait, we must have E at the end. So we need a word that ends with E and has A and doesn\'t use C, R, N.\n\n Also, note we are not forced to include A. But we know A is in the word, so we should include it.\n\n Let me choose ""SAUTE"": S A U T E -> but that has A at position 2. We are unsure about position 2? We know from feedback that A is not in position 2? Actually, the feedback only says A is in the word but not at position 2. So it could be in the word at position 1, 3 or 4? However, note: the feedback does not preclude that position 2 might be A? Wait, no: if the secret word had A in position 2, then when we guessed ""crane"" with A in position 2, it would have been marked with a check. Since it was not, we know A is not in position 2. Therefore, we must avoid putting A in position 2? Or we can put it but we already know it\'s wrong? Actually, we can put it again to confirm? But that might be a waste. Better to test a different position.\n\n So let\'s choose a word with A in position 1: Examples:\n\n - ""ABASE"": A B A S E -> but note, repeated A. We haven\'t tested B and S. However, it\'s valid. But with repeated letters? We don\'t know if the word has repeated letters. It\'s possible.\n\n Feedback: we know A is in the word, but if the secret word has two A\'s? Our feedback for ""crane"" didn\'t indicate that. But note: when we guessed ""crane"", we only had one A and it was marked present. That doesn\'t rule out two A\'s.\n\n However, let\'s avoid repetition for now.\n\n Let me choose ""AGAPE"": but again two A\'s? \n\n Or ""ADOBE"": no C,R,N? A D O B E -> O and B are new? And A at position 1? That\'s valid.\n\n But ""ADOBE"" ends with E? Yes.\n\n Alternatively, ""ALIKE"": A L I K E -> A at 1, and ends with E? Yes.\n\n Let\'s go with ""ALIKE"": we test A in position 1 and new letters L, I, K.\n\n But note: we know the word has E at the end and we have E in position 5 again? Actually, in feedback we already know E is at position 5. But guessing a word with E at position 5 again is fine because we can confirm and also test the rest.\n\n However, in position 1 we put A. We don\'t know if A should be at position 1 or not.\n\n Also, we are testing L, I, K.\n\n Alternatively, we can also try ""STALE"": S T A L E -> A at position 3? That\'s a new position. And S, T, L are new.\n\n Since we don\'t know where A is, testing position 3 is as good as position 1? Actually, we are testing two possibilities: position 1 and position 3. We can do either.\n\n I think ""STALE"" is a good candidate because S, T, L are common letters and A is at position 3 (which we haven\'t tried). But what if the A is actually at position 1? Then we won\'t test that. So maybe ""ATONE"" -> but avoids N? We can\'t use N? Because we know N is not in the word? Actually, the feedback said N was not present? So N is absent.\n\n So we cannot use N. Therefore, ""ATONE"" is invalid because it has N.\n\n How about ""STAGE"": S T A G E -> A at position 3? Then we test S, T, G.\n\n That\'s also good.\n\n Another option: ""SLATE"" -> S L A T E -> A at position 3? S, L, T.\n\n I think ""SLATE"" is a common word.\n\n But note: the feedback says we have E at the end. So we know that. We don\'t need to change the E.\n\n However, in ""SLATE"": \n   Position 1: S -> not tested before.\n   Position 2: L -> not tested.\n   Position 3: A -> we know A is in the word, here it\'s placed in a new position (3). \n   Position 4: T -> not tested.\n   Position 5: E -> already known.\n\n This word gives us information for S, L, T and checks A in position 3.\n\n Also, note: we don\'t use any forbidden letters (C, R, N).\n\n Alternatively, we can choose ""SAUCE"" -> but C is forbidden? We know C is not in the word? Actually, feedback said C(x). So avoid C.\n\n So ""SLATE"" seems good.\n\n What about ""PLATE""? P L A T E -> covers P, L, T. Also A at position 3.\n\n I don\'t see a strong preference. But let\'s go with ""SLATE"" because it uses more common letters? T is more common than P.\n\n Actually, yes. So we choose ""SLATE"".\n\n But wait: we have the possibility that A could be at position 1? But by putting it at position 3, if it gets marked as absent then we know it must be at position 4? Actually, no: the feedback will tell us for A if it\'s present and if so what position.\n\n Because the feedback per letter will tell us:\n\n - If A in SLATE (position 3) gets a ✓, then we know A is at position 3.\n - If A gets a \'-\', then we know A is present but not at 3 -> meaning it must be at position 1 or 4? \n - But note: if A is at position 1 and we put it at position 3, it would be marked with a \'-\' meaning it\'s present elsewhere.\n\n So we can get information about the position of A.\n\n Similarly, by testing S, L, T we get information.\n\n So let\'s guess ""SLATE"".\n\n<guess>slate</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **E(✓)** confirms that the secret word ends with `E`.\n- **A(-)** means the letter `A` is in the word but not in position 2.\n- **C(x)**, **R(x)**, and **N(x)** indicate these letters are not in the word.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- The word must end with `E` (position 5).\n- It must include `A` but avoid position 2 (since position 2 was incorrect for `A`).\n- We cannot use `C`, `R`, or `N`.\n- New letters should be tested to gather more information, focusing on common consonants like `S`, `L`, and `T`.\n\nI selected **slate** as the guess:\n- Positions: `S` (test position 1), `L` (test position 2), `A` (test position 3, avoiding position 2), `T` (test position 4), `E` (confirmed position 5).\n- This tests `A` in a new position (3) and introduces `S`, `L`, and `T`—frequent letters not yet evaluated.\n\n<guess>slate</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two sets of feedback:\n\nFirst guess: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)\nThis tells us:\n- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th).\n- A is in the word but not in the 2nd position.\n- C, R, N are not in the word.\n\nSecond guess: slate -> S(-) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(✓)\nThis tells us:\n- E is again confirmed in the 5th position (we already knew this).\n- S, L, A are all present but none of them are in the correct position in ""slate"".\n  Specifically:\n    S is not in position 1\n    L is not in position 2\n    A is not in position 3\n- T is not in the word at all.\n\nAdditionally, we know:\n- The word ends with E: ? ? ? ? E\n- A is in the word, but not in positions 2 (from first guess) and not in position 3 (from second guess). Therefore, A must be in position 1 or 4.\n- The absent letters are: C, R, N, T.\n- Present letters: E (position 5), A, S, L. And we have tested A, S, L without knowing their exact positions.\n\nNow, we need to form a new guess that:\n- Does not contain C, R, N, T (eliminated).\n- Must include S, L, A (because they are present) and of course E at the end.\n- But note: we must not place S in position 1 (because slate had S in 1 and got a dash meaning incorrect position), L not in position 2, and A not in position 3.\n- Also, since A can only be in position 1 or 4 (because positions 2 and 3 are now ruled out), we need to test A in one of these positions.\n\nPossible positions for the known letters:\n- Position 1: Could be A or S? But S was in position 1 and got a dash, meaning S is not in position 1, but it is in the word. So S might be in 2,3,4? Similarly, L is not in 2, and A is not in 2 or 3.\n\nSince A must be in position 1 or 4, let\'s consider trying A in position 1 in this guess.\n\nAlso, we need to place S and L in positions where we have not ruled them out. For S: we tried position 1 and it was wrong -> S must be in 2,3 or 4? But wait, we have slot 2,3,4 available. Similarly L: we tried position 2 which was wrong, so L must be in 1,3,4 -> but position 1 might be taken by A? So we consider.\n\nBut note: in the second guess, slate had:\n  pos1: S (not correct, but present) -> so S is in the word, just not at 1 -> thus S must be at 2,3, or 4.\n  pos2: L (not correct, but present) -> L must be at 1,3, or 4.\n\nHowever, if we try A at position 1, then we cannot put L at 1 (same position). Similarly, S cannot go to 1.\n\nSo the letters we must place: A, S, L and the last is E known. Plus we need one more letter.\n\nThe format: _ _ _ _ E\n\nWe are missing the 4th letter? Wait, we have four positions: 1,2,3,4. We know E is at 5.\n\nWe know the word has S, L, A, E and one more letter? Because so far we have found 4 letters: A, S, L, E? But our feedback only guaranteed A, S, L, E are present. However, we haven\'t tested all letters. There must be one more letter in position 3 or somewhere? Actually, the word has 5 letters. We only know 4: A, S, L, E? Or perhaps there are 5 distinct letters? The feedback doesn\'t rule out duplicates, but we haven\'t seen any duplicates. Let\'s proceed.\n\nWe need a fifth letter that is not C, R, N, T (because these are absent). And we don\'t know about other letters.\n\nFor the new guess, we must form a 5-letter word that:\n- Ends with E (position 5).\n- Contains A, S, L, and E (with E fixed at position 5).\n- Does not contain C, R, N, T.\n- And we must avoid putting A in position 2 or 3 (already tried) -> so only position 1 or 4 for A.\n- Also avoid S in position 1 (because that was tried) -> S can only be in 2,3,4.\n- Avoid L in position 2 -> L can be in 1,3,4.\n\nBut if we put A in position 1, then position 1 is occupied. Then S cannot be in 1? But we already avoid S in 1 so that\'s ok. Similarly, L cannot be in 1 because A is there? Then L must go to 3 or 4.\n\nSimilarly, if we put A in position 4, then position 4 is occupied.\n\nLet\'s try to build with A in position 1:\n\nSo: A _ _ _ E\n\nNow, we must assign S and L to positions 2,3,4? But without putting S at 1 (which we avoid) and L not in 2? So:\n\n- Position 2: cannot put L (because L was in position 2 and got a dash? Actually, we know L is not at position 2). So we can put S in position 2? Because S could be at 2? Then L must be placed in position 3 or 4? And we have position 3 open?\n\nActually, the positions we have to assign to S: only 2,3,4? But we can put S in 2? Similarly L in 3 or 4? But note: the word must be valid.\n\nAlternatively, A in position 4:\n\nThen: _ _ _ A E\n\nNow, assign S and L: S cannot be in 1? So S in position 2 or 3? L can be in position 1,3? But wait: position 1 is free? And L can be in position 1? Then we can have L at 1 and then S at 2 or 3? Also note: L was not tried in position 1? And S not tried in 2 or 3? So that\'s possible.\n\nBut we don\'t know which scenario (A at 1 or A at 4) is correct. We want to test A at 1? Then we should set A at 1 in this guess? Then we can get immediate feedback on A\'s position.\n\nSo let me try A in position 1.\n\nThus: A ? ? ? E\n\nWe need to assign S and L: and one more letter? Because we have three positions: 2,3,4.\n\nThe known letters we have to place: S and L. Then the fourth letter (for slot 2,3,4) must be an unknown letter? Actually, we have four letters: A, E, S, L. So the fifth letter is missing? Therefore the word has at least these four, but we need a fifth.\n\nWe have to choose one more letter (not C,R,N,T) and put it in one of the spots? And then assign S and L to the other two?\n\nAlso, we must not put S in position 1? But we are not putting S in 1 because we have A. Similarly L not in 2? So we can:\n\nOption: put S in position 2? Then we must put L in position 3 or 4? And the remaining position (either 3 or 4) for a new letter.\n\nBut note: if we put S in 2, that\'s a new position? We don\'t know about position 2 for S? Similarly, L in 3: we haven\'t tried L in 3? Position 4? Also.\n\nBut we know L was tried in position 2 and was wrong? But we can try L in 3 or 4.\n\nSimilarly, we can avoid position 2 for L? That is, we know L cannot be at 2? So in this guess, we don\'t put L at 2? Which is okay.\n\nSimilarly, S cannot be at 1? But we are putting S at 2? So:\n\nPosition 1: A\nPosition 2: S? \nPosition 3: ? \nPosition 4: ? \nPosition 5: E\n\nAnd L must go to position 3 or 4? And the other position is a new letter.\n\nBut we must avoid any letter that we know is absent? Not just C,R,N,T? But we haven\'t tested many.\n\nAlternatively, since A is at 1, and we need a word that works.\n\nCommon words: \n- Consider ""AISLE"": A I S L E -> E at end? Yes. \nBut check: \n  Position 1: A -> we are testing A at 1? So it might be correct? \n  Position 2: I -> new letter.\n  Position 3: S -> we haven\'t tried S in 3? \n  Position 4: L -> L in position 4? \n  Position 5: E.\n\nAnd the letters: A,I,S,L,E. \nAbsent letters we know: C,R,N,T -> I is not eliminated? Okay.\n\nBut note: feedback for A in the second guess was dash? But that\'s because it was at position 3? Now we are moving A to position 1? So it might be correct? We don\'t know.\n\nBut let\'s check if it violates any known restrictions:\n- We don\'t put S in 1? Here S is at position 3? So okay.\n- We don\'t put L in position 2? Here L is at position 4? Okay.\n- A is at position 1? We hope to get feedback if it\'s correct.\n\nBut what about S? We have S in the word? Yes. And we are placing S at position 3? Which we haven\'t tried? \n\nBut note: we have two possibilities for S: it might be at 2,3,4? We are testing 3.\n\nSimilarly, L: we are testing at position 4? And we haven\'t tried position 4 for L? \n\nAlso, we are testing I? So getting I tested is good.\n\nHowever, wait: the word ""AISLE""? We have previously tested A and we know it is present? But now we are putting A at position 1? If the secret word has A at 4? Then in this guess: A at position 1 would be marked as not correct (since it should be at 4)? I.e., a dash? So we learn.\n\nBut note: we also have to consider that there might be a duplicate? But let\'s try.\n\nAnother word with A at 1: ""ALOSE""? Is it valid? ALOSE? Not common. Better use ""ABUSE""? But we don\'t know B and we have U to test? But ""ABUSE"" uses B and U? And note: we must not use T (which we know is absent)? So B and U are possible.\n\nBut ""ABUSE"": A B U S E -> S is at position 4? Then L is missing? But our feedback says L is present? Oh wait: we know L is present? Because in ""slate"", L was at position 2 and marked dash? So L must be in the word? Therefore we must include L? Because when a letter gets a dash or check, it means it is in the word? Yes.\n\nTherefore, we cannot ignore L? Our guess must include L? Because we know L is present? So guess must contain S, L, A, E (and one more letter).\n\nSo in ""AISLE"", we have: A, I, S, L, E -> so L is included? at position 4. So it\'s valid.\n\nSimilarly, what about ""ALL SE""? But repeated L? We don\'t know if duplicates? So let\'s try ""AISLE"".\n\nBut note: we have two scenarios:\n\nIf the secret word has A at position 1, then ""AISLE"" with A at 1 might be correct? But we don\'t know.\n\nIf the secret has A at position 4, then A at 1 in ""AISLE"" would be marked as not correct? And we would see dash for A? Then we learn A is at 4? But then we have L at 4? And if we put L at 4? Wait no: in ""AISLE"", A is at 1 and L at 4? So if A is actually at 4? Then L at 4 would be wrong? Actually, no: because A at 4, then L must be elsewhere? But we don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, let\'s consider: instead of testing A at 1, we test A at 4? Then we could learn more? \n\nConsider: A at position 4.\n\nThen: _ _ _ A E\n\nWe must assign S and L? And one other letter? Without putting S at 1, L not at 2? And S not at 1? \n\nOptions:\n\nPosition 1: can put L? Because L was at position 2 and wasn\'t correct? So we haven\'t tried L at 1? So let Position 1: L? Then Position 2: must not be L? So put S at 3? Position 3? Or put Position 2: S? But S hasn\'t been tried at position 2? \n\nBut note: if we put L at 1: ? L ? ? E but the word is L ? ? A E\n\nThen we can:\n\nPosition 1: L? \nPosition 2: we can try a new letter? But S cannot be at 1? But we put L at 1? So S must be at position 3? Because if we put S at 2? Then S at position 2? We haven\'t tried S at 2. Similarly, position 3 is free? \n\nAlso, we have position 3 and 2 available? \n\nWhat word: ""C ?"" ... but without C. \n\nWord like ""LEASE""? But has E in position 1? Actually, no: we are putting L at position 1? Then we need S somewhere? And A at 4.\n\n""LEAVE""? L E A V E? But we don\'t know V? And also, A at 3? Then E? But E is already in position 5? And we have E at 2? But the word has two E\'s? Possible.\n\nBut note: ""LEAVE"" has E at position 2? And 5? And A at position 3? Then we have:\n\nPositions: 1:L, 2:E, 3:A, 4:V, 5:E? But we know E is at 5? And we haven\'t tested V? But also, we are missing S? Because S must be in the word? But ""LEAVE"" has L,E,A,V,E? No S? We cannot skip S? So discard.\n\nWe need a word that includes S? So:\n\nWhat about ""LOSES""? But fails: S repeated? And not starting? But we need L and A and S. And E at the end.\n\n""LASED""? L A S E D? But E is at position 4? And we require E at 5? And we have to have E at 5? So not valid.\n\nWe need E at the end? So ? ? ? A E\n\nWith letters L, S, and one more? And E at the end? So the word must be: ? ? ? A E\n\nWhere we put L at 1? Then we need S? And another letter? And avoid T,C,R,N.\n\n""LUCRE""? But C? Not allowed.\n\n""LAPSE"": L A P S E -> but positions:\n  1: L? \n  2: A? but we know A cannot be at position 2 (from first feedback)? Because ""crane"" had A at 2 and it got dash? Meaning A is in the word but not at position 2? So A at position 2 in this guess wouldn\'t be correct? Hence, we should avoid? \n\nBut in ""lapse"", if we put A at 2? Then we are putting A in a known wrong position? That gives no new information? \n\nActually, we cannot put A at 2? Because we know A is not at position 2? So the word must not have A at 2? But we are trying to put A at position 4? In this scenario. \n\nWait, no: if we are testing A at position 4? Then in ""lapse"", A is at position 2? So we must not choose that.\n\nSo we want a word that has A at position 4? Then the pattern: ? ? ? A E\n\nAnd we can put L at position 1? Then the next positions: 2 and 3: we assign one to S and another to a new letter? Without S at 1? And without L at 2? \n\nBut position 2: what? We can put a new letter? Then position 3: S? And A at 4? \n\nWord: L ? S A E ? \n\nWhat can go in position 2? \n\nExamples: ""LIBRA""? But R? Absent? And not ending E? \n\n""LIASE""? Is that word? No.\n\n""LEASE"": L E A S E? But A at position 3, not 4? Pattern: L E A S E -> then A at 3? And S at 4? And E at 5? But wait: we are trying to put A at 4? So wrong.\n\nBut we want A at position 4? So the word must have the fourth letter A? And then E at 5? And L at 1? Then position 2 and 3: can be S and a new letter? Or vice versa? \n\nWord: ? ? ? A E with L at 1:  L ? ? A E\n\nThen position 2: we can put any that is not T,C,R,N? And S must be in the word? So we can put S at position 2: then L S ? A E -> what can be in position 3? It must be a letter? Words like: ""LYASE""? But not common.\n\n""LASSO"" but ends O? No.\n\n""LASED""? But E is not at 4? And we need E at end? So L ? ? A E -> that\'s five letters? So positions: L, x, y, A, E\n\nWhat words: ""LUMPS""? doesn\'t have A? Not.\n\n""LAPJE""? Not English.\n\n""LATKE"" but T is absent? T is eliminated? \n\nPerhaps it\'s easier to test A at position 1? \n\nTherefore, I return to testing A at 1? And include L and S? And a new letter.\n\nSo pattern: A ? ? ? E\n\nWith S present? (must not be in 1? We put at 2,3,4) \nL present? (must not be in 2? We put at 3 or 4)\n\nAnd we have to fill two positions? For example, put S at position 2? Then L at position 3? And what at 4? A new letter? \n\nWord: A S L ? E? Like ""ASLIE""? Not word.\n\nOr A ? L ? E? With S at position 4: A ? L S E? \n\nExamples: ""ABULSE"" has extra letters.\n\nOr ""AISLE"": A I S L E\n\nAgain: positions: A at1, I at2, S at3, L at4, E at5? \n\nYes, ""aisle"" is a word and it meets:\n\n- A at 1? Testing that.\n- I is new? \n- S at 3? New position? \n- L at 4? New position? And E at5? known.\n- Letters: so we test I? Which is good.\n\nAlternatively ""AMBLE""? But M? And L at position 4? Similarly.\n\nAnother option: ""Apses""? But S repeated? And E at5? Not.\n\nI think ""AISLE"" is a good candidate.\n\nBut we also consider ""ABASE"": A B A S E? Repeated A? Also not include L? But we must include L? So ignore.\n\nAnother: ""ALWAYS""? But Y? And no S? And not ends E? \n\nSo better ""AISLE""\n\nBut what about ""AISLES""? Too long? \n\nNo, we need 5-letter word: ""AISLE"" is 5.\n\nSo we go with ""AISLE"": \n\n  A in position 1 -> we see if it\'s correct? \n  I in position 2 -> check if new letter present?\n  S in position 3 -> check correct?\n  L in position 4 -> check correct?\n  E in position 5 -> known.\n\nAnd avoid C,R,N,T? Yes, ""AISLE"" doesn\'t have any of these.\n\nSo let\'s guess ""AISLE""\n\n<guess>aisle</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n\n#### From Guess 1 (""crane""):\n- **C**: ❌ (not in word)\n- **R**: ❌ (not in word)\n- **A**: ➖ (in word, but not position 2)\n- **N**: ❌ (not in word)\n- **E**: ✓ (correct position: position 5)\n\n#### From Guess 2 (""slate""):\n- **S**: ➖ (in word, but not position 1)\n- **L**: ➖ (in word, but not position 2)\n- **A**: ➖ (in word, but not position 3)\n- **T**: ❌ (not in word)\n- **E**: ✓ (confirmed position 5)\n\n#### Key Deductions:\n1. The word ends with **E** (position 5).\n2. **A**, **S**, and **L** are in the word, but:\n   - **A** is not in positions 2 or 3 (eliminated).\n   - **S** is not in position 1 (eliminated).\n   - **L** is not in position 2 (eliminated).\n3. Absent letters: **C**, **R**, **N**, **T** (cannot be used).\n4. **A** must be in position 1 or 4 (only remaining positions).\n5. **S** must be in position 2, 3, or 4.\n6. **L** must be in position 1, 3, or 4.\n\nFor this guess:\n- Test **A** at position 1 (since position 4 remains untested and could be validated later).\n- Place **S** and **L** in new positions to maximize information:\n  - **S** cannot be in position 1→ placed at position 3.\n  - **L** cannot be in position 2→ placed at position 4.\n- Introduce a new letter **I** at position 2 to test for presence.\n- Structure: **A** (position 1), **I** (position 2), **S** (position 3), **L** (position 4), **E** (position 5).\n\nThe word **aisle** fits all constraints:\n- Contains **A**, **S**, **L**, and **E**.\n- Avoids forbidden letters (**C**, **R**, **N**, **T**).\n- Tests **A** at position 1 and new positions for **S** and **L**.\n\n<guess>aisle</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: aisle -> FEEDBACK: A(-) I(x) S(-) L(-) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We now have feedback from the third guess: ""aisle"" -> A(-) I(x) S(-) L(-) E(✓)\n\nLet\'s recap all feedback so far:\n\n**From guess 1 (crane):**\n- C: absent (x)\n- R: absent (x)\n- A: present, but not in position 2 (rightmost hint shows positions: crane is c(1), r(2), a(3), n(4), e(5)? Actually, in ""crane"", A is at position 3? Wait, no: positions: \n  Position 1: C -> x\n  Position 2: R -> x\n  Position 3: A -> present but wrong position? The user feedback: ""A(-)"" and it was the third letter? In the input ""crane"", the third letter is A? So A was in position 3? And marked with (-), meaning A is in the word but not in position 3?\n\nWait, the feedback format: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)\nSo this corresponds to:\n- Position 1: C (x)\n- Position 2: R (x)\n- Position 3: A (-) -> so A is in word, not at pos 3\n- Position 4: N (x)\n- Position 5: E (✓)\n\nSimilarly, guess 2: slate -> \n- Position 1: S (-)\n- Position 2: L (-)\n- Position 3: A (-)\n- Position 4: T (x)\n- Position 5: E (✓)\n\nGuess 3: aisle ->\n- Position 1: A (-)\n- Position 2: I (x)\n- Position 3: S (-)\n- Position 4: L (-)\n- Position 5: E (✓)\n\nSo absolute knowns:\n1. E is fixed at position 5: ???E? -> now the word ends with E. The pattern is [1][2][3][4]E\n\n2. A is present, but we now know:\n- From guess 1: not at position 3 (since in crane, A at pos3 marked -)\n- From guess 2: not at position 3 again? But already known? No new info. Actually, guess2 also had A at pos3? And it was marked - again? \n- From guess 3: not at position 1 (since in aisle, A at pos1 marked -)\n\nTherefore, A must be at position 4? Because positions: 1 (eliminated by guess3), 2 (eliminated by guess1? Actually no: guess1 only said A not at pos3? Wait, guess1: A was at pos3 and got dash? That only eliminates pos3? Similarly, guess2: A at pos3 again? Same. Guess3: A at pos1 -> dash? Eliminates pos1. So the only position left is position 4? Or position 2? But wait: we don\'t have any feedback that A is not at position 2? \n\nHow about the position 2? \nIn guess1: we tried R at position 2 and got x? That means R is absent, but doesn\'t say about A? \nIn guess2: we tried L at position 2 and got dash? That means L is present but not at position 2? Doesn\'t say anything about A? \nWe never tried A at position 2? So it might be possible? \n\nSo A could be at position 2 or 4? \nBut wait: in guess1: we didn\'t try position2 for A? In guess1, position2 was R? \nIn guess2: position2 was L? \nIn guess3: position1 was A? \n\nSo A has not been tried at position 2? So position 2 remains a possibility? Also position 4? \n\nBut in the word, the positions are 1-5? \nWe eliminated position 1 (by guess3)? \nWe eliminated position 3 (by guess1 and 2)? \nPosition 5 is E? So only position 2 or 4 for A? \n\nSo A must be at position 2 or 4? \n\n3. S is present:\n- From guess2: not at position 1 (marked dash at pos1 when guessed in slate)\n- From guess3: not at position 3 (marked dash at pos3 when guessed in aisle)\n- Also, what about position 4? We haven\'t tried position 4 for S? \n  So S could be at position 2, or 4? \n\n4. L is present:\n- From guess2: not at position 2 (marked dash at pos2 in slate)\n- From guess3: not at position 4 (marked dash at pos4 in aisle) -> because in aisle, L at pos4 got dash? \n  Also, we tried L at position 4? And it was present but wrong position? So L is not at position 4? \n  But could L be at position 1? Or 3? \n  Positions: we have not tried L at position 1 or 3? \n  Because: \n    In guess2: L was at position 2 -> eliminated\n    In guess3: L was at position 4 -> eliminated\n  So L must be at position 1 or 3? \n\n5. I is absent? (guess3: I at position2 marked x? So I is not in the word? \n\n6. T is absent (already known from guess2)\n\n7. C, R, N are absent.\n\nNow, we know the word has: A, S, L, E? But must have one more letter? Since 5 letters? So we need a fifth letter? Which we haven\'t found? We have tested E, A, S, L? But we tested other letters? We tested C,R,N,T,I? Absent? So more letters to guess? \n\nAlso, we haven\'t tested many consonants? And the fifth letter might be one that hasn\'t been tested? \n\nNow, let\'s organize the possibilities:\n\nPosition 1: Could be L? (since L must be at 1 or 3) or could be the fifth letter? But we have A, S, L to place? \n\nBut note: positions: \nWe know A must be at 2 or 4? \nS must be at 2 or 4? But if A and S are both at 2 or 4? They might conflict? \n\nAlso, L must be at 1 or 3? \n\nAnd we know E at 5? \n\nSo the pattern is: \n\nIf A at position 2 and S at position 4? Then pattern: [L? at1 or3] A [L? at3 or what?] and S at4? \n\nBut note: position3 might have L? Or the fifth letter?\n\nSimilarly, if A at4 and S at2? Then: [L? at1 or3] S [L? or other] A E? \n\nSo we should pick a guess that uses only the known present letters? And one new letter? Also avoiding absent letters? But what new letter to choose? \n\nBut we must include all known present letters? So we know A, S, L, E are present? So the fifth letter is missing? Which one is it? \n\nSo we must form a word with A, S, L, E, and one other letter? (not C, R, N, T, I)\n\nPossible? \n\nAlso, the positions: \n- L must be at 1 or 3?\n- A must be at 2 or 4?\n- S must be at 2 or 4? \n- E at 5.\n\nBut if L is at position 1? Then the word starts with L? \nThen position 2: must be A? Or S? Or the new letter? \nBut A and S need to be at 2 or 4? \n\nSimilarly, position 4: must be A or S? \n\nCase 1: Assume A at position 2? Then S must be at position 4? \nThen pattern: L A ? S E? Because position1: L? position2: A? position4: S? position5: E? \nThen position3: must be the fifth letter.\n\nBut L at1? Yes? \nA at2? \nS at4? \nE at5? \nSo we get: L A ? S E? \n\nThen we need a word: L A ? S E? \n\nWhat could be at position3? Letters not eliminated: we haven\'t tested any? We tried: C,R,N,T,I? Absent? \nPossible letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? \n\nBut common? For example, ""LEASE"" but then missing A? No? \n\nTry: ""LASES""? But S repeated? And L A S E S? But then S at position3 and also at4? Also E at5? So ""LASES""? But that\'s L A S E S -> but pattern L A S? E? S? But we know S at position4? So if ""LASES"" -> positions: \n1:L, 2:A, 3:S, 4:E, 5:S -> but S at3? We don\'t know? But we fixed A at2 and S at4? And E at5? But in this pattern we have S at3? So if we want S at4? Then we cannot have S at3? \n\nAnd ""LASES"" doesn\'t match because we put E at4? But we want E at5? And S at4? \n\nSo the word would be: L A ? S E? \nWith ? being a letter? And it can\'t be E? But the fifth letter? \n\nExample: ""LAZES""? L A Z E S? But then S at5? Not? \n\nNeeds to be L A [letter] S E? \n\n""LAPSE""? But P? Then: L A P S E? \nThen positions: \n1:L, 2:A, 3:P, 4:S, 5:E? \n\nThen we could have A at2? S at4? So it satisfies? \n\nIs ""LAPSE"" a word? Yes? \n\nBut note: we also have the possibility that A at4? \n\nBut first we try Case 1: A at2? and S at4? ""LAPSE"" has that? \n\nBut wait: what about L? In our scenario, we have L at1? Which is okay? \n\nAlternatively, if L is at position 3? Then pattern: ? ? L ? E? \n\nAnd if A at2? Then: ? A L ? E? But S must be at4? Then: ? A L S E? \n\nThen position1: must be a letter? \n\nExample: ""HALSE""? H A L S E? \n\nBut is that a word? Not common? \n\n""PULSE""? But U and P? And no A? We need A at position2? \n\nBut then we would have A at2? So ""PALSE""? Not word? \n\nNow, the other case: A at position4? \nThen S must be at position2? Because if A at4, then S must be at2? (since S must be at2 or4? And 4 taken)\n\nPattern: ? S ? A E? \n\nAnd L must be at position1 or3? \n\nThen:\n- If L at1: L S ? A E? \n  Example: ""L S ? A E"": ""LSOAE""? Not? \n\n  ""LSVAE""? Not? \n\n- If L at3: ? S L A E? \n  Example: ""USLAE""? Not? \n\n""MASLAE""? \n\nPerhaps Case 1 is more promising.\n\nAlso, we know L must be at1 or3? But if L is at3? And we put L at3? And S at2? And A at4? Then: ? S L A E? \n\nWe need a word: ? S L A E? \n\nWhat? ""ISLAE""? But I is absent? \n""ASLAE"" -> but A at1? We haven\'t tried A at1? But in this case A at4? So if first letter is something? \n""USLAE"" not? \n""PSLAE"" not? \n\nBut let\'s get back: perhaps we don\'t need to commit? Instead, test a word that covers multiple possibilities? \n\nBut we want to verify A\'s position? \n\nIn the third guess, we tried A at1 and got dash? Meaning A is not at1? And we know not at3? So only 2 and 4? \n\nTo test A at4? We can use a word that puts A at4? \n\nBut we also need S? And L? \n\nSo let\'s try a word that has A at4? \n\nExample: ? ? ? A E? \n\nBut we need to include S and L? And S must be at2? Because if S at4? Then conflict? Or S at2? And L at1 or3? \n\nAlso, the word must have a fifth letter? \n\nTry: ? S ? A E? With L at position3: ? S L A E? \n\nWords: ""USLAE""? Not English? \n\n""ISLAE"" has I? Absent? \n\nMaybe ""BESLA"" doesn\'t end E? \n\nNot? \n\nAnother idea: instead? If A at4? Then S at2? And L at1? Pattern: L S ? A E? \n\nWhat? ""LS __ A E""? \n\nExamples: ""L S I A E"" but I absent? \n""L S O A E""? Not word? \n""L S D A E""? \n\nCheck dictionary: ""LASED""? L A S E D? Doesn\'t match? \n\nBut ""LASED"" would be L A S E D? But then A at2? Not at4? \n\nSo we need L at1, S at2, A at4? But that would be L S [something] A E? ""L S ? A E""? \n\nLike ""LSGAE""? Not word? \n\nPerhaps we try another arrangement? Maybe put L at position3? \n\nPattern: ? S L A E? \n\nAgain, ""USLAE"" not? \n\nPerhaps it is not working? So maybe A at2? \n\nTherefore, we guess with A at2? \n\nAnd we also have L at1? \n\nThen S at4? \n\nThen the word must be: L A ? S E? \n\nThe fifth letter at position3? \n\nWe can choose a common letter? Like O? Or U? \n\n""LOUSE""? But O? Then L O U S E? But that has L at1, O at2? But we want A at2? Not O? \n\nBut A must be at2? So we have L at1 and A at2? Then ? at3 must be a letter? And S at4? E at5? \n\nPossible letters: let\'s try B? ""LABES""? But A? Then L A B E S? But S at5? And E at4? Not? Pattern L A [letter] S E? \n\nSo ""L A B S E"" -> ""LABSE""? Not a word? \n\n""L A P S E"" -> ""LAPSE"" -> valid word? \n\nYes, ""lapse"" means to fall into sin? \n\nSo let\'s guess ""LAPSE"": \n  Position1: L? \n  Position2: A? \n  Position3: P? \n  Position4: S? \n  Position5: E? \n\nThis tests:\n- L at position1? We haven\'t tried? \n- A at position2? Untried? \n- S at position4? Untried? \n- P is a new letter?\n\nAnd we avoid all absent letters? \n\nBut what if A is actually at position4? Then we won\'t get it? \n\nBut if we guess ""LAPSE"", and if A is at4? Then in feedback:\n- Position1: L? We know L is present? But if not correct? It will be marked dash? \n- Position2: A? If the secret has A at4? Then A at2 would be dash? \n- Position4: S? Then if S is at4? Maybe? But we haven\'t tried? \nBut also the fifth letter P? \n\nAlternatively, if we want to test A at position4? We can guess a word that puts A at4? But also includes L and S? And avoids conflict? \n\nBut we don\'t know: so we take a risk? \n\nGiven the feedback so far, ""LAPSE"" seems a good candidate? \n\nBut also, note: the word must not have any letters we know are absent? ""LAPSE"" has L,A,P,S,E? No C,R,N,T,I? So okay? \n\nAlternatively, ""LEASE"" but no A? And we know A must be present? \n\nSo we choose ""LAPSE""? \n\nBut let\'s check if we missed any constraint? \nWe have: \n- L at position1: possible? \n- A at position2: we haven\'t tried position2 for A? And we need to test? \n- P at position3: new letter? \n- S at position4: we haven\'t tried S at position4? \n- E at position5: known? \n\nYes? \n\nSo we guess ""LAPSE""? \n\n<guess>lapse</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n\n#### Summary of Known Information:\n1. **E** is firmly in position 5 (✓ in all guesses).\n2. **Present letters (must be included)**:\n   - **A**: In word, but eliminated from positions 1 (aisle), and 3 (crane and slate).\n   - **S**: In word, but eliminated from positions 1 (slate) and 3 (aisle).\n   - **L**: In word, but eliminated from positions 2 (slate) and 4 (aisle).\n3. **Absent letters (cannot be used)**:\n   - **C**, **R**, **N**, **T**, **I** (❌ in feedback).\n4. **Constraints**:\n   - **A** must be in position 2 or 4 (only untried positions left).\n   - **S** must be in position 2 or 4 (only untried positions).

We have feedback from Guess 4: lapse -> L(-) A(✓) P(x) S(✓) E(✓)

This tells us:
- **A**, **S**, and **E** are in their correct positions: 
  - Position 2: A (✓)
  - Position 4: S (✓)
  - Position 5: E (✓)
- **L** is present but not in position 1 (since we got L(-)).
- **P** is absent (x).

Now, combining all feedback:

1. **Fixed positions**:
   - Position 2: A
   - Position 4: S
   - Position 5: E
   So the word pattern is: _ A _ S E

2. **Confirmed present letters**:
   - **L**: Must be in the word (from previous feedback), but not in position 1 (from this guess) and not in positions 2 (fixed to A) or 4 (fixed to S) or 5 (fixed to E). Therefore, **L must be in position 3** (the only position left).

3. **Absent letters**: C, R, N, T, I, P (cannot be used).

4. **Other constraints**:
   - Position 1: Must be a letter not yet eliminated and not used (we know L is present but cannot be in position 1). So position 1 must be a **new letter** that is not absent.
   - Position 3: Since L must be in the word and position 3 is the only position available, **L is at position 3**.

Therefore, the secret word must be: [Position1] A L S E

We just need to determine position 1.

Known absent letters: C, R, N, T, I, P (so avoid these).

Possible letters for position 1: Any English letter not eliminated. Common options: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we must form a valid English word.

Common words fitting _ALSE:
- _ALSE pattern: false, valse, waltz? No, must end with SE? The pattern is _ A L S E? So last three are LSE? So words like: false, valse? But ""false"" has F? ""Valse"" is a word? Yes, VALSE (a dance) is acceptable.

But note: we haven't tested V? Good.

Blase? But ""blase"" is B L A S E? Pattern: position1:B, position2:L? Not? Our word is _ A L S E? So position2 must be A? 

Examples:
- B A L S E -> ""balse"" not a word? 
- F A L S E -> ""false"" which has S? Position4 is S? Then pattern: F A L S E? Positions: 1:F, 2:A, 3:L, 4:S, 5:E? Valid? And F not absent? 

False! 

Similarly, H A L S E -> ""halse""? Not common? 
M A L S E -> ""malse""? Maybe not? 
D A L S E -> ""dalse""? Not? 

Common: false, valse? 

But we know L must be at position3? Because it is present and only position3 is available? 

In ""false"": positions: 1:F, 2:A, 3:L, 4:S, 5:E? 

Yes? So we can guess ""false""? 

Since ""false"" uses F? Which we haven't tested? 

And F is not absent? 

Also, ""valse""? V A L S E? 

But let's see: the more common word is ""false"". 

Alternatively, ""waltz"" does not end with SE? 

So yes: we guess ""false"" to test F? 

But note: if we guess ""false"", we cover:
- Position1: F? New letter? 
- Position2: A (known) 
- Position3: L? We already know L must be there? 
- Position4: S (known) 
- Position5: E (known) 

So it directly tests F? 

But note: we haven't confirmed position3 is L? But logically L must be at position3? Because:
- We know L is present? 
- Eliminated positions: 1,2,4,5? So only position3? 

Therefore, if our deduction is correct, the word is _ALSE with position3=L? So the word is _A L S E? 

So let's confirm: 
If we guess ""false"", and it fits? 

But what if L secret? But we know L is present? And no other position? 

Therefore, we deduce the word must be ?ALSE? 

Valid words: false, valse, maybe dales? But ""dales"" is D A L E S -> A at2? E at4? But we have S at4? So no? We need E at5 and S at4? 

So with E at5, S at4? The pattern is ? A L S E? Yes. 

Examples: ""false"", ""valse"" are 5-letter words? 

Also, ""balse"" not? 

So guess ""false""

But note: the feedback we have? It will confirm? 

We can guess ""false""?

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Position Analysis**:
   - From Guess 4 (""lapse"" → `L(-) A(✓) P(x) S(✓) E(✓)`):
     - `A`, `S`, and `E` are fixed:  
       **Position 2 = `A`**, **Position 4 = `S`**, **Position 5 = `E`**.
     - `L` is present but **cannot be at Position 1**.
     - `P` is absent (❌).
   - Combined with prior feedback:
     - `L` is present but eliminated from Position 2 (Guess 2: `L(-)`) and Position 4 (Guess 3: `L(-)`). Position 5 is `E`, so **`L` must be at Position 3** (the only unassigned position).
     - Absent letters: `C`, `R`, `N`, `T`, `I`, `P` (cannot be used).
     - The word pattern is: **`[?] A L S E`** (Position 1 unknown, Position 3 = `L`).

2. **Position 1 Constraints**:
   - Position 1 must be a new letter not in `(C, R, N, T, I, P)`.
   - Common options: `B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z`.
   - Valid English words fitting `?ALSE`:
     - **`false`** (F), **`valse`** (V), or more obscure options.
     - `F` is a high-frequency letter and `false` is a common word. It tests Position 1 directly.

3. **Confirmation**:
   - Verifying `L` at Position 3:  
     `L` is present and must be here due to eliminations (Positions 1, 2, 4, 5 impossible).
   - Guessing `false` tests if `F` is Position 1 while maintaining all known constraints.

**Guess**: `false` (tests `F` and confirms the pattern).

<guess>false</guess>",false,"We have feedback from Guess 4: lapse -> L(-) A(✓) P(x) S(✓) E(✓)

This tells us:
- **A**, **S**, and **E** are in their correct positions: 
  - Position 2: A (✓)
  - Position 4: S (✓)
  - Position 5: E (✓)
- **L** is present but not in position 1 (since we got L(-)).
- **P** is absent (x).

Now, combining all feedback:

1. **Fixed positions**:
   - Position 2: A
   - Position 4: S
   - Position 5: E
   So the word pattern is: _ A _ S E

2. **Confirmed present letters**:
   - **L**: Must be in the word (from previous feedback), but not in position 1 (from this guess) and not in positions 2 (fixed to A) or 4 (fixed to S) or 5 (fixed to E). Therefore, **L must be in position 3** (the only position left).

3. **Absent letters**: C, R, N, T, I, P (cannot be used).

4. **Other constraints**:
   - Position 1: Must be a letter not yet eliminated and not used (we know L is present but cannot be in position 1). So position 1 must be a **new letter** that is not absent.
   - Position 3: Since L must be in the word and position 3 is the only position available, **L is at position 3**.

Therefore, the secret word must be: [Position1] A L S E

We just need to determine position 1.

Known absent letters: C, R, N, T, I, P (so avoid these).

Possible letters for position 1: Any English letter not eliminated. Common options: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we must form a valid English word.

Common words fitting _ALSE:
- _ALSE pattern: false, valse, waltz? No, must end with SE? The pattern is _ A L S E? So last three are LSE? So words like: false, valse? But ""false"" has F? ""Valse"" is a word? Yes, VALSE (a dance) is acceptable.

But note: we haven't tested V? Good.

Blase? But ""blase"" is B L A S E? Pattern: position1:B, position2:L? Not? Our word is _ A L S E? So position2 must be A? 

Examples:
- B A L S E -> ""balse"" not a word? 
- F A L S E -> ""false"" which has S? Position4 is S? Then pattern: F A L S E? Positions: 1:F, 2:A, 3:L, 4:S, 5:E? Valid? And F not absent? 

False! 

Similarly, H A L S E -> ""halse""? Not common? 
M A L S E -> ""malse""? Maybe not? 
D A L S E -> ""dalse""? Not? 

Common: false, valse? 

But we know L must be at position3? Because it is present and only position3 is available? 

In ""false"": positions: 1:F, 2:A, 3:L, 4:S, 5:E? 

Yes? So we can guess ""false""? 

Since ""false"" uses F? Which we haven't tested? 

And F is not absent? 

Also, ""valse""? V A L S E? 

But let's see: the more common word is ""false"". 

Alternatively, ""waltz"" does not end with SE? 

So yes: we guess ""false"" to test F? 

But note: if we guess ""false"", we cover:
- Position1: F? New letter? 
- Position2: A (known) 
- Position3: L? We already know L must be there? 
- Position4: S (known) 
- Position5: E (known) 

So it directly tests F? 

But note: we haven't confirmed position3 is L? But logically L must be at position3? Because:
- We know L is present? 
- Eliminated positions: 1,2,4,5? So only position3? 

Therefore, if our deduction is correct, the word is _ALSE with position3=L? So the word is _A L S E? 

So let's confirm: 
If we guess ""false"", and it fits? 

But what if L secret? But we know L is present? And no other position? 

Therefore, we deduce the word must be ?ALSE? 

Valid words: false, valse, maybe dales? But ""dales"" is D A L E S -> A at2? E at4? But we have S at4? So no? We need E at5 and S at4? 

So with E at5, S at4? The pattern is ? A L S E? Yes. 

Examples: ""false"", ""valse"" are 5-letter words? 

Also, ""balse"" not? 

So guess ""false""

But note: the feedback we have? It will confirm? 

We can guess ""false""?### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

   - Combined with prior feedback:
     - `L` is present but eliminated from Position 2 (Guess 2: `L(-)`) and Position 4 (Guess 3: `L(-)`). Position 5 is `E`, so **`L` must be at Position 3** (the only unassigned position).
     - Absent letters: `C`, `R`, `N`, `T`, `I`, `P` (cannot be used).
     - The word pattern is: **`[?] A L S E`** (Position 1 unknown, Position 3 = `L`).

2. **Position 1 Constraints**:
   - Position 1 must be a new letter not in `(C, R, N, T, I, P)`.
   - Common options: `B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z`.

3. **Confirmation**:
   - Verifying `L` at Position 3:  
     `L` is present and must be here due to eliminations (Positions 1, 2, 4, 5 impossible).
   - Guessing `false` tests if `F` is Position 1 while maintaining all known constraints.

**Guess**: `false` (tests `F` and confirms the pattern).",Guess 5: false -> FEEDBACK: F(✓) A(✓) L(✓) S(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
