We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that covers common letters and positions.
 A good starting word often has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants. 
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' — all fairly common.
   - It includes two vowels (A and E) and three consonants.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: x (not in the word)
  N: - (in the word but wrong position)
  E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
  - The letters C, R, A, E are not in the secret word at all.
  - The letter N is in the word, but not in the fourth position (since we guessed it in the fourth position and it was marked as wrong position).

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter N, but not in the 4th position. Also, it does not contain C, R, A, E.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
  - Does not contain C, R, A, E.
  - Contains the letter N (but not in the 4th position? Actually, it can be in any position except the 4th? But note: the feedback says it's in the word but not in the 4th position. However, it might appear again? But we don't know. Since we only have one N in ""crane"", and it was marked as present, we know at least one N is in the word. But we don't know if there are more. However, the feedback doesn't indicate duplicates, so we assume at least one N.

We also want to cover new letters to get more information.

Let's think of common letters that are still available. We have eliminated C, R, A, E. So we avoid these.

Common consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N (we know N is in), O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Common vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

But note: we have N already, so we can try to use it in a different position.

We also know that the word must have 5 letters and we have 6 tries.

We should try to include other common letters and avoid the ones we know are absent.

Let me list the absent letters: C, R, A, E.

We can try a word that has N and other common letters. For example, we might try words with S, T, L, O, etc.

Possible words: 
  We know N is in the word, so we can put N in a different position (not 4th). Let's try to put N in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th position.

But note: we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. Since we only have one N in our guess and it was marked as present, we assume at least one N. But we don't know if there are more.

We should avoid using the same letter twice in this guess unless necessary? Actually, we can, but to maximize information, we might prefer distinct letters.

Let me think of words that have N and other common letters, and without C, R, A, E.

Some ideas:
  - ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> but N is in the 4th position? We must avoid putting N in the 4th? Actually, no: the feedback only said that in the first guess, the N in the 4th position was wrong. But the word might have an N in the 4th and another N? But we don't know. However, to be safe, we should avoid putting N in the 4th position in this guess? Actually, we can put it anywhere because we are testing. But note: if we put N in the 4th again, and if the word has only one N and it is not in the 4th, then we will get a '-' again? But that doesn't give new information. So to test a new position, we should put N in a different position.

Alternatively, we can put N in a position we haven't tried. We tried position 4. So we can try position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Let me try to form a word with N in position 1: 
  N _ _ _ _

But we need to avoid C, R, A, E. What words? 
  e.g., ""NOISY"" -> but has S and Y, but we don't know about them. However, we are trying to cover more common letters.

But note: we also want to cover vowels. We have O and I in ""NOISY"". 

But let me think of more common words. Another idea: ""POINT"" has N in the 5th? Actually, ""POINT"" is P-O-I-N-T, so N is in the 4th? We want to avoid 4th? Then let's avoid.

We can try ""LIONS"": L-I-O-N-S -> N is in the 4th? Again 4th. 

How about ""SNOWY"": S-N-O-W-Y -> N is in the 2nd position. That's different. And it avoids the 4th. Also, the letters S, N, O, W, Y are all new (except N) and we haven't tested them.

But note: we know N is in the word, so we are including it. The other letters S, O, W, Y are not eliminated.

Alternatively, ""TONGS"": T-O-N-G-S -> N is in the 3rd position. That's also different.

But let's check the letters: T, O, N, G, S. All are new and not eliminated.

Another common word: ""POINT"" is not good because N is in 4th. ""SLING"": S-L-I-N-G -> N is in the 4th? Again 4th. 

We can try ""STING"": S-T-I-N-G -> N is in the 4th? Same.

How about ""JOINT"": same.

We need a word with N not in the 4th. Let me think of words ending with N? Then N is in the 5th. For example: ""BRAIN"" -> but B and R? We know R is eliminated (from first feedback: R was x). So we cannot use R.

We cannot use R because it was absent.

So words without R, and without C, A, E.

Let me try to form a word with N in the 5th: 
  _ _ _ _ N

Possible words: ""CHAIN"" -> but C is out. ""PLAIN"" -> P-L-A-I-N -> A is out. ""TRAIN"" -> T-R-A-I-N -> R and A are out. 

So we need a word without C, R, A, E and ending with N.

Examples: ""MINION"" -> 6 letters. Too long.
  ""UNION"" -> U-N-I-O-N -> but that's 5 letters? U, N, I, O, N -> has two N's. But we don't know if the word has two N's. Also, we are using N twice, which might not be efficient for getting new information.

But we can try: ""UNION"" -> but note: the word has two N's. We are going to guess U, N, I, O, N. The feedback might be: if the word has one N, then one of the N's might be correct (if in the right position) and the other might be absent? But the rules: if the letter is in the word, then each occurrence is marked. But if the word has only one N, then one of the N's in the guess will be marked as present (either in the correct position or wrong) and the other as absent? 

But we don't want to use duplicate letters if we can avoid, to maximize information.

So let's avoid duplicates.

Another word: ""BISON"" -> B-I-S-O-N -> N is in the 5th. Letters: B, I, S, O, N. All new except N. And we avoid C, R, A, E.

Similarly, ""TOWNS"" -> T-O-W-N-S -> N is in the 4th? We are trying to avoid 4th? Actually, in ""TOWNS"", N is in the 4th? Let me count: T(1), O(2), W(3), N(4), S(5). So 4th. We want to avoid 4th? 

But we can try a word with N in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th.

Let me try for 5th: 
  ""BISON"": B-I-S-O-N -> positions: 1:B, 2:I, 3:S, 4:O, 5:N -> so N is in 5th. Good.

Another: ""LYNX"" -> too short? 4 letters. Not 5.

""BEGIN"" -> B-E-G-I-N -> but E is out (from first feedback: E was x). So we cannot use E.

""LOGIN"" -> L-O-G-I-N -> N in 5th. And no E, A, R, C. So that's good.

But we have two options: ""BISON"" and ""LOGIN"". 

We can also consider ""POINT"" but N is in 4th? We want to avoid 4th? Actually, we don't have to strictly avoid, but it might be less informative if the word doesn't have an N in the 4th. But we can try a different position to get more information about the position of N.

So let's choose a word with N in a new position, say 5th.

I'll go with ""BISON"": 
  - It has B, I, S, O, N. 
  - We haven't tested B, I, S, O.
  - And we know N is in the word, so we are including it in a new position (5th).

Alternatively, ""LOGIN"" is also good: L, O, G, I, N.

But which one has more common letters? Both are reasonable.

We can also consider ""POINT"" but N in 4th? We might get the same feedback for N? But if the word has N in 4th, then we get a check? But we don't know. So to test a new position, we choose 5th.

Another common word: ""SHOWN"" -> S-H-O-W-N -> N in 5th. But H and W are less common? 

I think ""BISON"" is a good choice.

But let me check if ""BISON"" is a valid word: yes, it means a large animal.

So I'll go with ""BISON"".

But note: we are not sure if the word has two N's? But we are only using one N, which is fine.

So the guess is ""BISON"".

We'll see the feedback and then adjust.

Therefore, the next guess: ""bison""
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and E are **not** in the secret word.
- N is in the word but **not in the 4th position**.

For the second guess:
- Must include N (since it's confirmed in the word) but avoid placing it in the 4th position to test a new location.
- Avoid using C, R, A, or E.
- Prioritize common unused letters (e.g., S, T, O, I, B) to maximize information.

The word ""bison"" fits these criteria:
- Contains N in the 5th position (new position to test).
- Uses new common letters: B, I, S, O.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, E).

This guess will help identify the correct position of N and reveal more about the secret word's letters.

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that covers common letters and positions.
 A good starting word often has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants. 
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' — all fairly common.
   - It includes two vowels (A and E) and three consonants.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: x (not in the word)
  N: - (in the word but wrong position)
  E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
  - The letters C, R, A, E are not in the secret word at all.
  - The letter N is in the word, but not in the fourth position (since we guessed it in the fourth position and it was marked as wrong position).

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter N, but not in the 4th position. Also, it does not contain C, R, A, E.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
  - Does not contain C, R, A, E.
  - Contains the letter N (but not in the 4th position? Actually, it can be in any position except the 4th? But note: the feedback says it's in the word but not in the 4th position. However, it might appear again? But we don't know. Since we only have one N in ""crane"", and it was marked as present, we know at least one N is in the word. But we don't know if there are more. However, the feedback doesn't indicate duplicates, so we assume at least one N.

We also want to cover new letters to get more information.

Let's think of common letters that are still available. We have eliminated C, R, A, E. So we avoid these.

Common consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N (we know N is in), O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Common vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

But note: we have N already, so we can try to use it in a different position.

We also know that the word must have 5 letters and we have 6 tries.

We should try to include other common letters and avoid the ones we know are absent.

Let me list the absent letters: C, R, A, E.

We can try a word that has N and other common letters. For example, we might try words with S, T, L, O, etc.

Possible words: 
  We know N is in the word, so we can put N in a different position (not 4th). Let's try to put N in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th position.

But note: we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. Since we only have one N in our guess and it was marked as present, we assume at least one N. But we don't know if there are more.

We should avoid using the same letter twice in this guess unless necessary? Actually, we can, but to maximize information, we might prefer distinct letters.

Let me think of words that have N and other common letters, and without C, R, A, E.

Some ideas:
  - ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> but N is in the 4th position? We must avoid putting N in the 4th? Actually, no: the feedback only said that in the first guess, the N in the 4th position was wrong. But the word might have an N in the 4th and another N? But we don't know. However, to be safe, we should avoid putting N in the 4th position in this guess? Actually, we can put it anywhere because we are testing. But note: if we put N in the 4th again, and if the word has only one N and it is not in the 4th, then we will get a '-' again? But that doesn't give new information. So to test a new position, we should put N in a different position.

Alternatively, we can put N in a position we haven't tried. We tried position 4. So we can try position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Let me try to form a word with N in position 1: 
  N _ _ _ _

But we need to avoid C, R, A, E. What words? 
  e.g., ""NOISY"" -> but has S and Y, but we don't know about them. However, we are trying to cover more common letters.

But note: we also want to cover vowels. We have O and I in ""NOISY"". 

But let me think of more common words. Another idea: ""POINT"" has N in the 5th? Actually, ""POINT"" is P-O-I-N-T, so N is in the 4th? We want to avoid 4th? Then let's avoid.

We can try ""LIONS"": L-I-O-N-S -> N is in the 4th? Again 4th. 

How about ""SNOWY"": S-N-O-W-Y -> N is in the 2nd position. That's different. And it avoids the 4th. Also, the letters S, N, O, W, Y are all new (except N) and we haven't tested them.

But note: we know N is in the word, so we are including it. The other letters S, O, W, Y are not eliminated.

Alternatively, ""TONGS"": T-O-N-G-S -> N is in the 3rd position. That's also different.

But let's check the letters: T, O, N, G, S. All are new and not eliminated.

Another common word: ""POINT"" is not good because N is in 4th. ""SLING"": S-L-I-N-G -> N is in the 4th? Again 4th. 

We can try ""STING"": S-T-I-N-G -> N is in the 4th? Same.

How about ""JOINT"": same.

We need a word with N not in the 4th. Let me think of words ending with N? Then N is in the 5th. For example: ""BRAIN"" -> but B and R? We know R is eliminated (from first feedback: R was x). So we cannot use R.

We cannot use R because it was absent.

So words without R, and without C, A, E.

Let me try to form a word with N in the 5th: 
  _ _ _ _ N

Possible words: ""CHAIN"" -> but C is out. ""PLAIN"" -> P-L-A-I-N -> A is out. ""TRAIN"" -> T-R-A-I-N -> R and A are out. 

So we need a word without C, R, A, E and ending with N.

Examples: ""MINION"" -> 6 letters. Too long.
  ""UNION"" -> U-N-I-O-N -> but that's 5 letters? U, N, I, O, N -> has two N's. But we don't know if the word has two N's. Also, we are using N twice, which might not be efficient for getting new information.

But we can try: ""UNION"" -> but note: the word has two N's. We are going to guess U, N, I, O, N. The feedback might be: if the word has one N, then one of the N's might be correct (if in the right position) and the other might be absent? But the rules: if the letter is in the word, then each occurrence is marked. But if the word has only one N, then one of the N's in the guess will be marked as present (either in the correct position or wrong) and the other as absent? 

But we don't want to use duplicate letters if we can avoid, to maximize information.

So let's avoid duplicates.

Another word: ""BISON"" -> B-I-S-O-N -> N is in the 5th. Letters: B, I, S, O, N. All new except N. And we avoid C, R, A, E.

Similarly, ""TOWNS"" -> T-O-W-N-S -> N is in the 4th? We are trying to avoid 4th? Actually, in ""TOWNS"", N is in the 4th? Let me count: T(1), O(2), W(3), N(4), S(5). So 4th. We want to avoid 4th? 

But we can try a word with N in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th.

Let me try for 5th: 
  ""BISON"": B-I-S-O-N -> positions: 1:B, 2:I, 3:S, 4:O, 5:N -> so N is in 5th. Good.

Another: ""LYNX"" -> too short? 4 letters. Not 5.

""BEGIN"" -> B-E-G-I-N -> but E is out (from first feedback: E was x). So we cannot use E.

""LOGIN"" -> L-O-G-I-N -> N in 5th. And no E, A, R, C. So that's good.

But we have two options: ""BISON"" and ""LOGIN"". 

We can also consider ""POINT"" but N is in 4th? We want to avoid 4th? Actually, we don't have to strictly avoid, but it might be less informative if the word doesn't have an N in the 4th. But we can try a different position to get more information about the position of N.

So let's choose a word with N in a new position, say 5th.

I'll go with ""BISON"": 
  - It has B, I, S, O, N. 
  - We haven't tested B, I, S, O.
  - And we know N is in the word, so we are including it in a new position (5th).

Alternatively, ""LOGIN"" is also good: L, O, G, I, N.

But which one has more common letters? Both are reasonable.

We can also consider ""POINT"" but N in 4th? We might get the same feedback for N? But if the word has N in 4th, then we get a check? But we don't know. So to test a new position, we choose 5th.

Another common word: ""SHOWN"" -> S-H-O-W-N -> N in 5th. But H and W are less common? 

I think ""BISON"" is a good choice.

But let me check if ""BISON"" is a valid word: yes, it means a large animal.

So I'll go with ""BISON"".

But note: we are not sure if the word has two N's? But we are only using one N, which is fine.

So the guess is ""BISON"".

We'll see the feedback and then adjust.

Therefore, the next guess: ""bison""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and E are **not** in the secret word.
- N is in the word but **not in the 4th position**.

For the second guess:
- Must include N (since it's confirmed in the word) but avoid placing it in the 4th position to test a new location.
- Avoid using C, R, A, or E.
- Prioritize common unused letters (e.g., S, T, O, I, B) to maximize information.

The word ""bison"" fits these criteria:
- Contains N in the 5th position (new position to test).
- Uses new common letters: B, I, S, O.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, E).

This guess will help identify the correct position of N and reveal more about the secret word's letters.

We are given feedback for two guesses:

First guess: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: x (not in word)
  A: x (not in word)
  N: - (in word, wrong position)
  E: x (not in word)

Second guess: ""bison""
  B: x (not in word)
  I: - (in word, wrong position)
  S: x (not in word)
  O: x (not in word)
  N: - (in word, wrong position)

From this, we can deduce:

Absent letters: C, R, A, E, B, S, O
Present letters (but in wrong position): N (from first guess) and I (from second guess), and also N again in the second guess (but it's the same N, so we know N is in the word, but not in position 4 or 5).

Specifically:
- The secret word contains N, but not in position 4 (from first guess) and not in position 5 (from second guess). So N must be in one of positions 1, 2, or 3.
- The secret word contains I, but not in position 2 (since in ""bison"", I was in position 2 and marked as wrong position). So I is in the word, but not at position 2.

Also, we have eliminated: A, B, C, E, O, R, S.

So the remaining letters to consider are: D, F, G, H, I (we know it's present), J, K, L, M, N (we know it's present), P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Includes I and N (since they are present)
- Does not include any of the absent letters: A, B, C, E, O, R, S.
- Places N in either position 1, 2, or 3 (since it can't be in 4 or 5).
- Places I in any position except 2 (since it was in position 2 and was wrong).

Additionally, we want to cover as many new letters as possible to get more information.

Let's think of words that have I and N, and fit the constraints.

Possible positions for N: 1, 2, 3.

We also note that I cannot be in position 2, so I can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.

But we have to avoid the absent letters.

Let me try to list some words:

Option 1: N in position 1, I in position 3? 
  Example: ""N_T_I"" or similar.

But we need to fill the blanks.

Another idea: ""DINGY"" -> but we don't know about D, G, Y. However, note that we have to avoid O (which is absent) and others. But ""DINGY"" has D, I, N, G, Y. 
  - I is in position 2? But we cannot put I in position 2 because we know I is not in position 2 (from the feedback of ""bison""). So if we put I in position 2, we expect it to be wrong, but we want to test new positions? Actually, we know I is not in position 2, so we should avoid putting it there to not waste a position.

So in ""DINGY"", I is in position 2, which we know is wrong. So that would not be efficient because we already know that. We want to put I in a position we haven't tried.

We have only tried I in position 2 (in ""bison""). So we can try I in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Similarly, for N, we have tried position 4 and 5, so we can try 1, 2, or 3.

Let me try to form words:

- If we put N in position 1 and I in position 3: 
  N _ I _ _
  We need to fill the other positions with letters not in the absent list.

  Possible: ""N T I P S"" -> but S is absent. Not allowed.
  ""N U I T ?"" -> but we need a 5th letter. ""NUIT"" is 4 letters. 
  ""N U I T S"" -> S absent.

  How about ""N O I S E"" -> but O and S and E are absent.

  Not working.

- Put N in position 1 and I in position 4:
  N _ _ I _
  Example: ""N A T I O"" -> A and O absent.
  ""N E T I D"" -> E absent.

  We need letters from the available set.

  Available: D, F, G, H, I (but we are using it), J, K, L, M, N (using), P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

  So: ""N _ _ I _""

  Possibilities: 
    ""N D G I T"" -> ""ndgit"" not a word.
    ""N I G H T"" -> but I is in position 2? We are trying to put I in position 4? Actually, in ""NIGHT"", I is in position 3? Let's see: N(1), I(2), G(3), H(4), T(5). So I is in position 2, which we want to avoid.

  We need I in position 4. So: 
    ""N _ _ I _""

  How about ""L U N I T"" -> but that's L in position 1, not N. We are putting N in 1.

  Another: ""N I L T I"" -> duplicate I and I in position 2? Not good.

  How about ""N U L I N"" -> duplicate N and I in position 4? But we are trying to avoid duplicates? And N is in 1 and 5? We don't know if the word has two N's.

  But let's think of common words: ""M U N I C"" -> C absent. 
  ""P U N I T"" -> P, U, N, I, T -> N in position 3? We are trying to put N in 1.

  Maybe we should try N in position 2 or 3.

- Put N in position 2 and I in position 1:
  I N _ _ _
  Example: ""I N K E D"" -> E absent.
  ""I N T R O"" -> R and O absent.

  We need: ""I N _ _ _""

  With available letters: ""I N D E X"" -> E absent.
  ""I N P U T"" -> P, U, T -> but we don't know about P, U, T. And no absent letters. So ""INPUT"" is a word.

  But note: we have I in position 1 and N in position 2. We know I is in the word, but we don't know if it can be in position 1? We haven't tested position 1 for I. Similarly, we haven't tested position 2 for N? We tried N in 4 and 5, but not 2.

  So ""INPUT"" could be a candidate.

  However, we also have to consider that we know N is not in position 4 or 5, but position 2 is new. Similarly, I is not in position 2, but position 1 is new.

  So ""INPUT"" uses I, N, P, U, T. All letters are either new or present (I and N). And we avoid absent letters.

- Put N in position 2 and I in position 3:
  _ I N _ _
  Example: ""M I N T Y"" -> M, I, N, T, Y -> but I is in position 2? We know I cannot be in position 2. So we cannot put I in position 2.

  We must avoid putting I in position 2.

- Put N in position 2 and I in position 4:
  _ I _ N _
  But then I is in position 2 -> not allowed.

- Put N in position 2 and I in position 5:
  _ I _ _ N
  Then I is in position 2 -> not allowed.

So if we put N in position 2, we cannot put I in the same word without putting I in a position we haven't tried? Because if we put N in 2, then the other positions for I are 1,3,4,5. But if we put I in 1, that's the case above (""INPUT""). If we put I in 3,4,5, then we have to avoid position 2 for I, which we are not using for I in that case? Actually, in the word, we are putting N in 2 and I in, say, 3: then the word has I in 3 and N in 2. But we are not putting I in 2, so that's okay. However, in the structure, if we have N in 2, then we can have I in 1,3,4,5.

But in the case of N in 2 and I in 3: 
  _ N I _ _ -> but wait, if N is in 2, then the first letter is something, then N in 2, then I in 3? So the word is like X N I Y Z.

But we can do that. For example: ""U N I T S"" -> but S absent. 
  ""U N I T Y"" -> U, N, I, T, Y -> but we have I in position 3? And we haven't tried I in position 3. So that's okay.

But we must avoid absent letters: so ""UNITY"" has U, N, I, T, Y. None of these are in the absent list (absent: A,B,C,E,O,R,S). So it's valid.

But note: we are using I in position 3, which is new.

Similarly, we can have ""UNIFY"", ""UNLIT"", etc.

But let's compare with the earlier ""INPUT"".

Now, put N in position 3 and I in position 1:
  I _ N _ _
  Example: ""I M N P C"" -> not a word. 
  ""I D N A S"" -> absent letters.
  ""I T N I S"" -> duplicate I and S absent.

  How about ""I D N E A"" -> absent.

  ""I N D I G"" -> but then I is in position 1 and 4? And N in position 2? We are trying to put N in 3? 

  We need: I in 1, then a letter, then N in 3.

  Example: ""I L N T H"" -> not a word? ""ilnth"" no.
  ""I N T N I"" -> not good.

  Common word: ""INANE"" -> but A and E absent.

  Not easy.

- N in position 3 and I in position 4:
  _ _ N I _
  Example: ""T U N I C"" -> C absent.
  ""T U N I S"" -> S absent.
  ""D U N I T"" -> D, U, N, I, T -> ""dunit"" is a word? Or ""DUNIT""? Not common. 
  ""M U N I T"" -> M, U, N, I, T -> ""munit"" not a word.

  How about ""MINTY"" -> but N is in position 3? M(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), Y(5). But then I is in position 2 -> we cannot because I cannot be in position 2.

  We must avoid I in position 2.

  So if we have N in 3, then I in 4: 
    _ _ N I _
    Then the second position can be filled, but we cannot put I there. So we can put any letter except absent and except I? But we are not forced to put I in the second position.

  Example: ""P I N I T"" -> I in position 2 and 4? We cannot have I in 2.

  How about ""T O N I C"" -> O and C absent.

  ""L U N I T"" -> L, U, N, I, T -> ""lunit"" not a word? But ""unlit"" is a word, but that's U in 1, N in 2, L in 3, I in 4, T in 5 -> then N is in 2, which we are considering separately.

  Actually, for N in position 3, we can have: 
    ""B E N I G"" -> absent letters.

  It's challenging.

Given the above, let's go back to the two candidates we have:

Candidate 1: ""INPUT"" -> I in position 1, N in position 2, P, U, T.
Candidate 2: ""UNITY"" -> U in position 1, N in position 2, I in position 3, T, Y.

But note: in ""UNITY"", we have I in position 3, which is acceptable because we haven't tested position 3 for I. And we know I is in the word but not in position 2.

However, we also have to consider that we are using N in position 2 in both. We haven't tested N in position 2, so it could be correct or not.

But we want to maximize information. Both words use common letters.

Another candidate: ""NITRO"" -> but O and R are absent.

Not valid.

""PINTO"" -> O absent.

""MINTS"" -> S absent.

""LINGO"" -> O absent and we cannot use O.

""THING"" -> T, H, I, N, G -> but I is in position 3? And N in position 4? We have tried N in 4 and 5, but not 3? Actually, in ""THING"": T(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), G(5). But we know N cannot be in position 4 (from first guess). So we cannot put N in 4. Therefore, ""THING"" is invalid because it puts N in 4.

Similarly, we must avoid putting N in 4 or 5.

So in our candidate ""INPUT"": N is in position 2 -> valid.
In ""UNITY"": N is in position 2 -> valid.

But we can also consider N in position 1 or 3.

Another idea: ""NEXUS"" -> E and S absent.

""NADIR"" -> A and R absent.

""NAVEL"" -> A and E absent.

Not working.

How about ""NUKED"" -> E absent.

""NYLON"" -> O and L? But O absent.

So let's consider the two candidates: ""INPUT"" and ""UNITY"".

We can also consider ""DINGY"" but we cannot because I would be in position 2? In ""DINGY"": D(1), I(2), N(3), G(4), Y(5). So I is in position 2 -> we know that is wrong, so we shouldn't. But if we use it, we might get I marked as present but wrong position? But we already know I is in the word and not in position 2. So it doesn't give new information about I's position. We want to test a new position for I.

Therefore, we prefer words that put I in a position we haven't tried: 1, 3, 4, or 5.

In ""INPUT"", I is in position 1 -> new.
In ""UNITY"", I is in position 3 -> new.

Both are good.

But ""INPUT"" has the advantage of having T and P, which are common.

""UNITY"" has U, T, Y.

We can also consider ""GUILD"" -> but we don't have N? We must include N because we know N is in the word. So we cannot skip N.

So we must include both I and N.

Another candidate: ""UNFIT"" -> U, N, F, I, T -> N in position 2, I in position 4? 
  Positions: U(1), N(2), F(3), I(4), T(5). 
  So I is in position 4 -> new. And N in 2 -> new.

  This is also a candidate.

But ""UNFIT"" uses F, which is less common? But we don't know.

We can choose among ""INPUT"", ""UNITY"", and ""UNFIT"".

But note: we have only 4 guesses left? We are on the third guess.

We want to maximize the information.

""INPUT"" and ""UNITY"" both have T, which is common.

But let's look at the positions:

We know:
- N is in the word, not in 4 or 5 -> so must be in 1,2,3.
- I is in the word, not in 2.

In ""INPUT"":
  I in 1 -> we test if I is in position 1.
  N in 2 -> test if N is in position 2.
  Then P, U, T.

In ""UNITY"":
  U in 1 -> test U in 1.
  N in 2 -> test N in 2.
  I in 3 -> test I in 3.
  T in 4, Y in 5.

""UNITY"" tests three positions for the known letters: N in 2, I in 3, and also U and Y.

But we don't know if U and Y are in the word.

Similarly, ""INPUT"" tests I in 1 and N in 2.

But ""UNITY"" covers more positions for the known letters? Specifically, it tests two new positions for the known letters (I in 3 and N in 2) and also two new letters (U, T, Y) but T is repeated.

Actually, ""UNITY"" has the advantage of testing I in a new position (3) and N in a new position (2) and also the letter U and Y.

But we have to consider that if the word has both I and N, and we are testing two positions at once, we might get multiple hits.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has N in position 3 and I in position 1 or 4 or 5.

For example: ""DIVAN"" -> but A absent and V? ""divan"" has A, which is absent.

""VINYL"" -> V, I, N, Y, L -> I in 2? Not allowed.

""WINCH"" -> C absent.

""MINIM"" -> duplicate I and M? But I in 2? Not allowed.

""KINKY"" -> K, I, N, K, Y -> I in 2? Not allowed.

""JINGO"" -> O absent.

""FIGHT"" -> F, I, G, H, T -> I in 2? Not allowed.

""LIGHT"" -> L, I, G, H, T -> I in 2? Not allowed.

So it's hard to find a word with N in 3 and I not in 2.

Therefore, let's go with one of the candidates.

I think ""UNITY"" is a good choice because:
  - It tests N in position 2 (which is a possible position)
  - It tests I in position 3 (new position)
  - It introduces three new letters: U, T, Y (and T is very common)

So we'll guess ""UNITY"".

But note: we have to make sure we are not using any absent letters. U, N, I, T, Y: none are in the absent list (A,B,C,E,O,R,S).

So it's valid.

Therefore, the third guess is ""UNITY"".

<guess>unity</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback:

- **Absent Letters**: C, R, A, E, B, S, O (cannot be in the word).
- **Present Letters (wrong position)**: 
  - N (must be in positions 1, 2, or 3, since it was wrong in positions 4 and 5).
  - I (must be in the word but not in position 2).
- **Goal for the next guess**: Test new positions for I and N while covering common unused letters (e.g., T, U, Y).

The word **""UNITY""** fits perfectly:
- Includes confirmed letters: **N** (in position 2) and **I** (in position 3, a new position to test).
- Avoids all absent letters.
- Introduces new common letters: **U**, **T**, and **Y**.
- Tests N in position 2 (previously untested) and I in position 3 (previously untested), maximizing positional information.

This guess will help narrow down the correct positions of I and N while checking for new letters.

<guess>unity</guess>",unity,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

First guess: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: x (not in word)
  A: x (not in word)
  N: - (in word, wrong position)
  E: x (not in word)

Second guess: ""bison""
  B: x (not in word)
  I: - (in word, wrong position)
  S: x (not in word)
  O: x (not in word)
  N: - (in word, wrong position)

From this, we can deduce:

Absent letters: C, R, A, E, B, S, O
Present letters (but in wrong position): N (from first guess) and I (from second guess), and also N again in the second guess (but it's the same N, so we know N is in the word, but not in position 4 or 5).

Specifically:
- The secret word contains N, but not in position 4 (from first guess) and not in position 5 (from second guess). So N must be in one of positions 1, 2, or 3.
- The secret word contains I, but not in position 2 (since in ""bison"", I was in position 2 and marked as wrong position). So I is in the word, but not at position 2.

Also, we have eliminated: A, B, C, E, O, R, S.

So the remaining letters to consider are: D, F, G, H, I (we know it's present), J, K, L, M, N (we know it's present), P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Includes I and N (since they are present)
- Does not include any of the absent letters: A, B, C, E, O, R, S.
- Places N in either position 1, 2, or 3 (since it can't be in 4 or 5).
- Places I in any position except 2 (since it was in position 2 and was wrong).

Additionally, we want to cover as many new letters as possible to get more information.

Let's think of words that have I and N, and fit the constraints.

Possible positions for N: 1, 2, 3.

We also note that I cannot be in position 2, so I can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.

But we have to avoid the absent letters.

Let me try to list some words:

Option 1: N in position 1, I in position 3? 
  Example: ""N_T_I"" or similar.

But we need to fill the blanks.

Another idea: ""DINGY"" -> but we don't know about D, G, Y. However, note that we have to avoid O (which is absent) and others. But ""DINGY"" has D, I, N, G, Y. 
  - I is in position 2? But we cannot put I in position 2 because we know I is not in position 2 (from the feedback of ""bison""). So if we put I in position 2, we expect it to be wrong, but we want to test new positions? Actually, we know I is not in position 2, so we should avoid putting it there to not waste a position.

So in ""DINGY"", I is in position 2, which we know is wrong. So that would not be efficient because we already know that. We want to put I in a position we haven't tried.

We have only tried I in position 2 (in ""bison""). So we can try I in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Similarly, for N, we have tried position 4 and 5, so we can try 1, 2, or 3.

Let me try to form words:

- If we put N in position 1 and I in position 3: 
  N _ I _ _
  We need to fill the other positions with letters not in the absent list.

  Possible: ""N T I P S"" -> but S is absent. Not allowed.
  ""N U I T ?"" -> but we need a 5th letter. ""NUIT"" is 4 letters. 
  ""N U I T S"" -> S absent.

  How about ""N O I S E"" -> but O and S and E are absent.

  Not working.

- Put N in position 1 and I in position 4:
  N _ _ I _
  Example: ""N A T I O"" -> A and O absent.
  ""N E T I D"" -> E absent.

  We need letters from the available set.

  Available: D, F, G, H, I (but we are using it), J, K, L, M, N (using), P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

  So: ""N _ _ I _""

  Possibilities: 
    ""N D G I T"" -> ""ndgit"" not a word.
    ""N I G H T"" -> but I is in position 2? We are trying to put I in position 4? Actually, in ""NIGHT"", I is in position 3? Let's see: N(1), I(2), G(3), H(4), T(5). So I is in position 2, which we want to avoid.

  We need I in position 4. So: 
    ""N _ _ I _""

  How about ""L U N I T"" -> but that's L in position 1, not N. We are putting N in 1.

  Another: ""N I L T I"" -> duplicate I and I in position 2? Not good.

  How about ""N U L I N"" -> duplicate N and I in position 4? But we are trying to avoid duplicates? And N is in 1 and 5? We don't know if the word has two N's.

  But let's think of common words: ""M U N I C"" -> C absent. 
  ""P U N I T"" -> P, U, N, I, T -> N in position 3? We are trying to put N in 1.

  Maybe we should try N in position 2 or 3.

- Put N in position 2 and I in position 1:
  I N _ _ _
  Example: ""I N K E D"" -> E absent.
  ""I N T R O"" -> R and O absent.

  We need: ""I N _ _ _""

  With available letters: ""I N D E X"" -> E absent.
  ""I N P U T"" -> P, U, T -> but we don't know about P, U, T. And no absent letters. So ""INPUT"" is a word.

  But note: we have I in position 1 and N in position 2. We know I is in the word, but we don't know if it can be in position 1? We haven't tested position 1 for I. Similarly, we haven't tested position 2 for N? We tried N in 4 and 5, but not 2.

  So ""INPUT"" could be a candidate.

  However, we also have to consider that we know N is not in position 4 or 5, but position 2 is new. Similarly, I is not in position 2, but position 1 is new.

  So ""INPUT"" uses I, N, P, U, T. All letters are either new or present (I and N). And we avoid absent letters.

- Put N in position 2 and I in position 3:
  _ I N _ _
  Example: ""M I N T Y"" -> M, I, N, T, Y -> but I is in position 2? We know I cannot be in position 2. So we cannot put I in position 2.

  We must avoid putting I in position 2.

- Put N in position 2 and I in position 4:
  _ I _ N _
  But then I is in position 2 -> not allowed.

- Put N in position 2 and I in position 5:
  _ I _ _ N
  Then I is in position 2 -> not allowed.

So if we put N in position 2, we cannot put I in the same word without putting I in a position we haven't tried? Because if we put N in 2, then the other positions for I are 1,3,4,5. But if we put I in 1, that's the case above (""INPUT""). If we put I in 3,4,5, then we have to avoid position 2 for I, which we are not using for I in that case? Actually, in the word, we are putting N in 2 and I in, say, 3: then the word has I in 3 and N in 2. But we are not putting I in 2, so that's okay. However, in the structure, if we have N in 2, then we can have I in 1,3,4,5.

But in the case of N in 2 and I in 3: 
  _ N I _ _ -> but wait, if N is in 2, then the first letter is something, then N in 2, then I in 3? So the word is like X N I Y Z.

But we can do that. For example: ""U N I T S"" -> but S absent. 
  ""U N I T Y"" -> U, N, I, T, Y -> but we have I in position 3? And we haven't tried I in position 3. So that's okay.

But we must avoid absent letters: so ""UNITY"" has U, N, I, T, Y. None of these are in the absent list (absent: A,B,C,E,O,R,S). So it's valid.

But note: we are using I in position 3, which is new.

Similarly, we can have ""UNIFY"", ""UNLIT"", etc.

But let's compare with the earlier ""INPUT"".

Now, put N in position 3 and I in position 1:
  I _ N _ _
  Example: ""I M N P C"" -> not a word. 
  ""I D N A S"" -> absent letters.
  ""I T N I S"" -> duplicate I and S absent.

  How about ""I D N E A"" -> absent.

  ""I N D I G"" -> but then I is in position 1 and 4? And N in position 2? We are trying to put N in 3? 

  We need: I in 1, then a letter, then N in 3.

  Example: ""I L N T H"" -> not a word? ""ilnth"" no.
  ""I N T N I"" -> not good.

  Common word: ""INANE"" -> but A and E absent.

  Not easy.

- N in position 3 and I in position 4:
  _ _ N I _
  Example: ""T U N I C"" -> C absent.
  ""T U N I S"" -> S absent.
  ""D U N I T"" -> D, U, N, I, T -> ""dunit"" is a word? Or ""DUNIT""? Not common. 
  ""M U N I T"" -> M, U, N, I, T -> ""munit"" not a word.

  How about ""MINTY"" -> but N is in position 3? M(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), Y(5). But then I is in position 2 -> we cannot because I cannot be in position 2.

  We must avoid I in position 2.

  So if we have N in 3, then I in 4: 
    _ _ N I _
    Then the second position can be filled, but we cannot put I there. So we can put any letter except absent and except I? But we are not forced to put I in the second position.

  Example: ""P I N I T"" -> I in position 2 and 4? We cannot have I in 2.

  How about ""T O N I C"" -> O and C absent.

  ""L U N I T"" -> L, U, N, I, T -> ""lunit"" not a word? But ""unlit"" is a word, but that's U in 1, N in 2, L in 3, I in 4, T in 5 -> then N is in 2, which we are considering separately.

  Actually, for N in position 3, we can have: 
    ""B E N I G"" -> absent letters.

  It's challenging.

Given the above, let's go back to the two candidates we have:

Candidate 1: ""INPUT"" -> I in position 1, N in position 2, P, U, T.
Candidate 2: ""UNITY"" -> U in position 1, N in position 2, I in position 3, T, Y.

But note: in ""UNITY"", we have I in position 3, which is acceptable because we haven't tested position 3 for I. And we know I is in the word but not in position 2.

However, we also have to consider that we are using N in position 2 in both. We haven't tested N in position 2, so it could be correct or not.

But we want to maximize information. Both words use common letters.

Another candidate: ""NITRO"" -> but O and R are absent.

Not valid.

""PINTO"" -> O absent.

""MINTS"" -> S absent.

""LINGO"" -> O absent and we cannot use O.

""THING"" -> T, H, I, N, G -> but I is in position 3? And N in position 4? We have tried N in 4 and 5, but not 3? Actually, in ""THING"": T(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), G(5). But we know N cannot be in position 4 (from first guess). So we cannot put N in 4. Therefore, ""THING"" is invalid because it puts N in 4.

Similarly, we must avoid putting N in 4 or 5.

So in our candidate ""INPUT"": N is in position 2 -> valid.
In ""UNITY"": N is in position 2 -> valid.

But we can also consider N in position 1 or 3.

Another idea: ""NEXUS"" -> E and S absent.

""NADIR"" -> A and R absent.

""NAVEL"" -> A and E absent.

Not working.

How about ""NUKED"" -> E absent.

""NYLON"" -> O and L? But O absent.

So let's consider the two candidates: ""INPUT"" and ""UNITY"".

We can also consider ""DINGY"" but we cannot because I would be in position 2? In ""DINGY"": D(1), I(2), N(3), G(4), Y(5). So I is in position 2 -> we know that is wrong, so we shouldn't. But if we use it, we might get I marked as present but wrong position? But we already know I is in the word and not in position 2. So it doesn't give new information about I's position. We want to test a new position for I.

Therefore, we prefer words that put I in a position we haven't tried: 1, 3, 4, or 5.

In ""INPUT"", I is in position 1 -> new.
In ""UNITY"", I is in position 3 -> new.

Both are good.

But ""INPUT"" has the advantage of having T and P, which are common.

""UNITY"" has U, T, Y.

We can also consider ""GUILD"" -> but we don't have N? We must include N because we know N is in the word. So we cannot skip N.

So we must include both I and N.

Another candidate: ""UNFIT"" -> U, N, F, I, T -> N in position 2, I in position 4? 
  Positions: U(1), N(2), F(3), I(4), T(5). 
  So I is in position 4 -> new. And N in 2 -> new.

  This is also a candidate.

But ""UNFIT"" uses F, which is less common? But we don't know.

We can choose among ""INPUT"", ""UNITY"", and ""UNFIT"".

But note: we have only 4 guesses left? We are on the third guess.

We want to maximize the information.

""INPUT"" and ""UNITY"" both have T, which is common.

But let's look at the positions:

We know:
- N is in the word, not in 4 or 5 -> so must be in 1,2,3.
- I is in the word, not in 2.

In ""INPUT"":
  I in 1 -> we test if I is in position 1.
  N in 2 -> test if N is in position 2.
  Then P, U, T.

In ""UNITY"":
  U in 1 -> test U in 1.
  N in 2 -> test N in 2.
  I in 3 -> test I in 3.
  T in 4, Y in 5.

""UNITY"" tests three positions for the known letters: N in 2, I in 3, and also U and Y.

But we don't know if U and Y are in the word.

Similarly, ""INPUT"" tests I in 1 and N in 2.

But ""UNITY"" covers more positions for the known letters? Specifically, it tests two new positions for the known letters (I in 3 and N in 2) and also two new letters (U, T, Y) but T is repeated.

Actually, ""UNITY"" has the advantage of testing I in a new position (3) and N in a new position (2) and also the letter U and Y.

But we have to consider that if the word has both I and N, and we are testing two positions at once, we might get multiple hits.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has N in position 3 and I in position 1 or 4 or 5.

For example: ""DIVAN"" -> but A absent and V? ""divan"" has A, which is absent.

""VINYL"" -> V, I, N, Y, L -> I in 2? Not allowed.

""WINCH"" -> C absent.

""MINIM"" -> duplicate I and M? But I in 2? Not allowed.

""KINKY"" -> K, I, N, K, Y -> I in 2? Not allowed.

""JINGO"" -> O absent.

""FIGHT"" -> F, I, G, H, T -> I in 2? Not allowed.

""LIGHT"" -> L, I, G, H, T -> I in 2? Not allowed.

So it's hard to find a word with N in 3 and I not in 2.

Therefore, let's go with one of the candidates.

I think ""UNITY"" is a good choice because:
  - It tests N in position 2 (which is a possible position)
  - It tests I in position 3 (new position)
  - It introduces three new letters: U, T, Y (and T is very common)

So we'll guess ""UNITY"".

But note: we have to make sure we are not using any absent letters. U, N, I, T, Y: none are in the absent list (A,B,C,E,O,R,S).

So it's valid.

Therefore, the third guess is ""UNITY"".

<guess>unity</guess>After analyzing the feedback:

- **Absent Letters**: C, R, A, E, B, S, O (cannot be in the word).
- **Present Letters (wrong position)**: 
  - N (must be in positions 1, 2, or 3, since it was wrong in positions 4 and 5).
  - I (must be in the word but not in position 2).
- **Goal for the next guess**: Test new positions for I and N while covering common unused letters (e.g., T, U, Y).

The word **""UNITY""** fits perfectly:
- Includes confirmed letters: **N** (in position 2) and **I** (in position 3, a new position to test).
- Avoids all absent letters.
- Introduces new common letters: **U**, **T**, and **Y**.
- Tests N in position 2 (previously untested) and I in position 3 (previously untested), maximizing positional information.

This guess will help narrow down the correct positions of I and N while checking for new letters.",Guess 3: unity -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(✓) I(-) T(-) Y(x),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that covers common letters and positions.
 A good starting word often has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants. 
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' — all fairly common.
   - It includes two vowels (A and E) and three consonants.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: x (not in the word)
  N: - (in the word but wrong position)
  E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
  - The letters C, R, A, E are not in the secret word at all.
  - The letter N is in the word, but not in the fourth position (since we guessed it in the fourth position and it was marked as wrong position).

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter N, but not in the 4th position. Also, it does not contain C, R, A, E.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
  - Does not contain C, R, A, E.
  - Contains the letter N (but not in the 4th position? Actually, it can be in any position except the 4th? But note: the feedback says it's in the word but not in the 4th position. However, it might appear again? But we don't know. Since we only have one N in ""crane"", and it was marked as present, we know at least one N is in the word. But we don't know if there are more. However, the feedback doesn't indicate duplicates, so we assume at least one N.

We also want to cover new letters to get more information.

Let's think of common letters that are still available. We have eliminated C, R, A, E. So we avoid these.

Common consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N (we know N is in), O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Common vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

But note: we have N already, so we can try to use it in a different position.

We also know that the word must have 5 letters and we have 6 tries.

We should try to include other common letters and avoid the ones we know are absent.

Let me list the absent letters: C, R, A, E.

We can try a word that has N and other common letters. For example, we might try words with S, T, L, O, etc.

Possible words: 
  We know N is in the word, so we can put N in a different position (not 4th). Let's try to put N in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th position.

But note: we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. Since we only have one N in our guess and it was marked as present, we assume at least one N. But we don't know if there are more.

We should avoid using the same letter twice in this guess unless necessary? Actually, we can, but to maximize information, we might prefer distinct letters.

Let me think of words that have N and other common letters, and without C, R, A, E.

Some ideas:
  - ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> but N is in the 4th position? We must avoid putting N in the 4th? Actually, no: the feedback only said that in the first guess, the N in the 4th position was wrong. But the word might have an N in the 4th and another N? But we don't know. However, to be safe, we should avoid putting N in the 4th position in this guess? Actually, we can put it anywhere because we are testing. But note: if we put N in the 4th again, and if the word has only one N and it is not in the 4th, then we will get a '-' again? But that doesn't give new information. So to test a new position, we should put N in a different position.

Alternatively, we can put N in a position we haven't tried. We tried position 4. So we can try position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Let me try to form a word with N in position 1: 
  N _ _ _ _

But we need to avoid C, R, A, E. What words? 
  e.g., ""NOISY"" -> but has S and Y, but we don't know about them. However, we are trying to cover more common letters.

But note: we also want to cover vowels. We have O and I in ""NOISY"". 

But let me think of more common words. Another idea: ""POINT"" has N in the 5th? Actually, ""POINT"" is P-O-I-N-T, so N is in the 4th? We want to avoid 4th? Then let's avoid.

We can try ""LIONS"": L-I-O-N-S -> N is in the 4th? Again 4th. 

How about ""SNOWY"": S-N-O-W-Y -> N is in the 2nd position. That's different. And it avoids the 4th. Also, the letters S, N, O, W, Y are all new (except N) and we haven't tested them.

But note: we know N is in the word, so we are including it. The other letters S, O, W, Y are not eliminated.

Alternatively, ""TONGS"": T-O-N-G-S -> N is in the 3rd position. That's also different.

But let's check the letters: T, O, N, G, S. All are new and not eliminated.

Another common word: ""POINT"" is not good because N is in 4th. ""SLING"": S-L-I-N-G -> N is in the 4th? Again 4th. 

We can try ""STING"": S-T-I-N-G -> N is in the 4th? Same.

How about ""JOINT"": same.

We need a word with N not in the 4th. Let me think of words ending with N? Then N is in the 5th. For example: ""BRAIN"" -> but B and R? We know R is eliminated (from first feedback: R was x). So we cannot use R.

We cannot use R because it was absent.

So words without R, and without C, A, E.

Let me try to form a word with N in the 5th: 
  _ _ _ _ N

Possible words: ""CHAIN"" -> but C is out. ""PLAIN"" -> P-L-A-I-N -> A is out. ""TRAIN"" -> T-R-A-I-N -> R and A are out. 

So we need a word without C, R, A, E and ending with N.

Examples: ""MINION"" -> 6 letters. Too long.
  ""UNION"" -> U-N-I-O-N -> but that's 5 letters? U, N, I, O, N -> has two N's. But we don't know if the word has two N's. Also, we are using N twice, which might not be efficient for getting new information.

But we can try: ""UNION"" -> but note: the word has two N's. We are going to guess U, N, I, O, N. The feedback might be: if the word has one N, then one of the N's might be correct (if in the right position) and the other might be absent? But the rules: if the letter is in the word, then each occurrence is marked. But if the word has only one N, then one of the N's in the guess will be marked as present (either in the correct position or wrong) and the other as absent? 

But we don't want to use duplicate letters if we can avoid, to maximize information.

So let's avoid duplicates.

Another word: ""BISON"" -> B-I-S-O-N -> N is in the 5th. Letters: B, I, S, O, N. All new except N. And we avoid C, R, A, E.

Similarly, ""TOWNS"" -> T-O-W-N-S -> N is in the 4th? We are trying to avoid 4th? Actually, in ""TOWNS"", N is in the 4th? Let me count: T(1), O(2), W(3), N(4), S(5). So 4th. We want to avoid 4th? 

But we can try a word with N in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th.

Let me try for 5th: 
  ""BISON"": B-I-S-O-N -> positions: 1:B, 2:I, 3:S, 4:O, 5:N -> so N is in 5th. Good.

Another: ""LYNX"" -> too short? 4 letters. Not 5.

""BEGIN"" -> B-E-G-I-N -> but E is out (from first feedback: E was x). So we cannot use E.

""LOGIN"" -> L-O-G-I-N -> N in 5th. And no E, A, R, C. So that's good.

But we have two options: ""BISON"" and ""LOGIN"". 

We can also consider ""POINT"" but N is in 4th? We want to avoid 4th? Actually, we don't have to strictly avoid, but it might be less informative if the word doesn't have an N in the 4th. But we can try a different position to get more information about the position of N.

So let's choose a word with N in a new position, say 5th.

I'll go with ""BISON"": 
  - It has B, I, S, O, N. 
  - We haven't tested B, I, S, O.
  - And we know N is in the word, so we are including it in a new position (5th).

Alternatively, ""LOGIN"" is also good: L, O, G, I, N.

But which one has more common letters? Both are reasonable.

We can also consider ""POINT"" but N in 4th? We might get the same feedback for N? But if the word has N in 4th, then we get a check? But we don't know. So to test a new position, we choose 5th.

Another common word: ""SHOWN"" -> S-H-O-W-N -> N in 5th. But H and W are less common? 

I think ""BISON"" is a good choice.

But let me check if ""BISON"" is a valid word: yes, it means a large animal.

So I'll go with ""BISON"".

But note: we are not sure if the word has two N's? But we are only using one N, which is fine.

So the guess is ""BISON"".

We'll see the feedback and then adjust.

Therefore, the next guess: ""bison""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and E are **not** in the secret word.
- N is in the word but **not in the 4th position**.

For the second guess:
- Must include N (since it's confirmed in the word) but avoid placing it in the 4th position to test a new location.
- Avoid using C, R, A, or E.
- Prioritize common unused letters (e.g., S, T, O, I, B) to maximize information.

The word ""bison"" fits these criteria:
- Contains N in the 5th position (new position to test).
- Uses new common letters: B, I, S, O.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, E).

This guess will help identify the correct position of N and reveal more about the secret word's letters.

<guess>bison</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: bison -> FEEDBACK: B(x) I(-) S(x) O(x) N(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:

First guess: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: x (not in word)
  A: x (not in word)
  N: - (in word, wrong position)
  E: x (not in word)

Second guess: ""bison""
  B: x (not in word)
  I: - (in word, wrong position)
  S: x (not in word)
  O: x (not in word)
  N: - (in word, wrong position)

From this, we can deduce:

Absent letters: C, R, A, E, B, S, O
Present letters (but in wrong position): N (from first guess) and I (from second guess), and also N again in the second guess (but it's the same N, so we know N is in the word, but not in position 4 or 5).

Specifically:
- The secret word contains N, but not in position 4 (from first guess) and not in position 5 (from second guess). So N must be in one of positions 1, 2, or 3.
- The secret word contains I, but not in position 2 (since in ""bison"", I was in position 2 and marked as wrong position). So I is in the word, but not at position 2.

Also, we have eliminated: A, B, C, E, O, R, S.

So the remaining letters to consider are: D, F, G, H, I (we know it's present), J, K, L, M, N (we know it's present), P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Includes I and N (since they are present)
- Does not include any of the absent letters: A, B, C, E, O, R, S.
- Places N in either position 1, 2, or 3 (since it can't be in 4 or 5).
- Places I in any position except 2 (since it was in position 2 and was wrong).

Additionally, we want to cover as many new letters as possible to get more information.

Let's think of words that have I and N, and fit the constraints.

Possible positions for N: 1, 2, 3.

We also note that I cannot be in position 2, so I can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.

But we have to avoid the absent letters.

Let me try to list some words:

Option 1: N in position 1, I in position 3? 
  Example: ""N_T_I"" or similar.

But we need to fill the blanks.

Another idea: ""DINGY"" -> but we don't know about D, G, Y. However, note that we have to avoid O (which is absent) and others. But ""DINGY"" has D, I, N, G, Y. 
  - I is in position 2? But we cannot put I in position 2 because we know I is not in position 2 (from the feedback of ""bison""). So if we put I in position 2, we expect it to be wrong, but we want to test new positions? Actually, we know I is not in position 2, so we should avoid putting it there to not waste a position.

So in ""DINGY"", I is in position 2, which we know is wrong. So that would not be efficient because we already know that. We want to put I in a position we haven't tried.

We have only tried I in position 2 (in ""bison""). So we can try I in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Similarly, for N, we have tried position 4 and 5, so we can try 1, 2, or 3.

Let me try to form words:

- If we put N in position 1 and I in position 3: 
  N _ I _ _
  We need to fill the other positions with letters not in the absent list.

  Possible: ""N T I P S"" -> but S is absent. Not allowed.
  ""N U I T ?"" -> but we need a 5th letter. ""NUIT"" is 4 letters. 
  ""N U I T S"" -> S absent.

  How about ""N O I S E"" -> but O and S and E are absent.

  Not working.

- Put N in position 1 and I in position 4:
  N _ _ I _
  Example: ""N A T I O"" -> A and O absent.
  ""N E T I D"" -> E absent.

  We need letters from the available set.

  Available: D, F, G, H, I (but we are using it), J, K, L, M, N (using), P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

  So: ""N _ _ I _""

  Possibilities: 
    ""N D G I T"" -> ""ndgit"" not a word.
    ""N I G H T"" -> but I is in position 2? We are trying to put I in position 4? Actually, in ""NIGHT"", I is in position 3? Let's see: N(1), I(2), G(3), H(4), T(5). So I is in position 2, which we want to avoid.

  We need I in position 4. So: 
    ""N _ _ I _""

  How about ""L U N I T"" -> but that's L in position 1, not N. We are putting N in 1.

  Another: ""N I L T I"" -> duplicate I and I in position 2? Not good.

  How about ""N U L I N"" -> duplicate N and I in position 4? But we are trying to avoid duplicates? And N is in 1 and 5? We don't know if the word has two N's.

  But let's think of common words: ""M U N I C"" -> C absent. 
  ""P U N I T"" -> P, U, N, I, T -> N in position 3? We are trying to put N in 1.

  Maybe we should try N in position 2 or 3.

- Put N in position 2 and I in position 1:
  I N _ _ _
  Example: ""I N K E D"" -> E absent.
  ""I N T R O"" -> R and O absent.

  We need: ""I N _ _ _""

  With available letters: ""I N D E X"" -> E absent.
  ""I N P U T"" -> P, U, T -> but we don't know about P, U, T. And no absent letters. So ""INPUT"" is a word.

  But note: we have I in position 1 and N in position 2. We know I is in the word, but we don't know if it can be in position 1? We haven't tested position 1 for I. Similarly, we haven't tested position 2 for N? We tried N in 4 and 5, but not 2.

  So ""INPUT"" could be a candidate.

  However, we also have to consider that we know N is not in position 4 or 5, but position 2 is new. Similarly, I is not in position 2, but position 1 is new.

  So ""INPUT"" uses I, N, P, U, T. All letters are either new or present (I and N). And we avoid absent letters.

- Put N in position 2 and I in position 3:
  _ I N _ _
  Example: ""M I N T Y"" -> M, I, N, T, Y -> but I is in position 2? We know I cannot be in position 2. So we cannot put I in position 2.

  We must avoid putting I in position 2.

- Put N in position 2 and I in position 4:
  _ I _ N _
  But then I is in position 2 -> not allowed.

- Put N in position 2 and I in position 5:
  _ I _ _ N
  Then I is in position 2 -> not allowed.

So if we put N in position 2, we cannot put I in the same word without putting I in a position we haven't tried? Because if we put N in 2, then the other positions for I are 1,3,4,5. But if we put I in 1, that's the case above (""INPUT""). If we put I in 3,4,5, then we have to avoid position 2 for I, which we are not using for I in that case? Actually, in the word, we are putting N in 2 and I in, say, 3: then the word has I in 3 and N in 2. But we are not putting I in 2, so that's okay. However, in the structure, if we have N in 2, then we can have I in 1,3,4,5.

But in the case of N in 2 and I in 3: 
  _ N I _ _ -> but wait, if N is in 2, then the first letter is something, then N in 2, then I in 3? So the word is like X N I Y Z.

But we can do that. For example: ""U N I T S"" -> but S absent. 
  ""U N I T Y"" -> U, N, I, T, Y -> but we have I in position 3? And we haven't tried I in position 3. So that's okay.

But we must avoid absent letters: so ""UNITY"" has U, N, I, T, Y. None of these are in the absent list (absent: A,B,C,E,O,R,S). So it's valid.

But note: we are using I in position 3, which is new.

Similarly, we can have ""UNIFY"", ""UNLIT"", etc.

But let's compare with the earlier ""INPUT"".

Now, put N in position 3 and I in position 1:
  I _ N _ _
  Example: ""I M N P C"" -> not a word. 
  ""I D N A S"" -> absent letters.
  ""I T N I S"" -> duplicate I and S absent.

  How about ""I D N E A"" -> absent.

  ""I N D I G"" -> but then I is in position 1 and 4? And N in position 2? We are trying to put N in 3? 

  We need: I in 1, then a letter, then N in 3.

  Example: ""I L N T H"" -> not a word? ""ilnth"" no.
  ""I N T N I"" -> not good.

  Common word: ""INANE"" -> but A and E absent.

  Not easy.

- N in position 3 and I in position 4:
  _ _ N I _
  Example: ""T U N I C"" -> C absent.
  ""T U N I S"" -> S absent.
  ""D U N I T"" -> D, U, N, I, T -> ""dunit"" is a word? Or ""DUNIT""? Not common. 
  ""M U N I T"" -> M, U, N, I, T -> ""munit"" not a word.

  How about ""MINTY"" -> but N is in position 3? M(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), Y(5). But then I is in position 2 -> we cannot because I cannot be in position 2.

  We must avoid I in position 2.

  So if we have N in 3, then I in 4: 
    _ _ N I _
    Then the second position can be filled, but we cannot put I there. So we can put any letter except absent and except I? But we are not forced to put I in the second position.

  Example: ""P I N I T"" -> I in position 2 and 4? We cannot have I in 2.

  How about ""T O N I C"" -> O and C absent.

  ""L U N I T"" -> L, U, N, I, T -> ""lunit"" not a word? But ""unlit"" is a word, but that's U in 1, N in 2, L in 3, I in 4, T in 5 -> then N is in 2, which we are considering separately.

  Actually, for N in position 3, we can have: 
    ""B E N I G"" -> absent letters.

  It's challenging.

Given the above, let's go back to the two candidates we have:

Candidate 1: ""INPUT"" -> I in position 1, N in position 2, P, U, T.
Candidate 2: ""UNITY"" -> U in position 1, N in position 2, I in position 3, T, Y.

But note: in ""UNITY"", we have I in position 3, which is acceptable because we haven't tested position 3 for I. And we know I is in the word but not in position 2.

However, we also have to consider that we are using N in position 2 in both. We haven't tested N in position 2, so it could be correct or not.

But we want to maximize information. Both words use common letters.

Another candidate: ""NITRO"" -> but O and R are absent.

Not valid.

""PINTO"" -> O absent.

""MINTS"" -> S absent.

""LINGO"" -> O absent and we cannot use O.

""THING"" -> T, H, I, N, G -> but I is in position 3? And N in position 4? We have tried N in 4 and 5, but not 3? Actually, in ""THING"": T(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), G(5). But we know N cannot be in position 4 (from first guess). So we cannot put N in 4. Therefore, ""THING"" is invalid because it puts N in 4.

Similarly, we must avoid putting N in 4 or 5.

So in our candidate ""INPUT"": N is in position 2 -> valid.
In ""UNITY"": N is in position 2 -> valid.

But we can also consider N in position 1 or 3.

Another idea: ""NEXUS"" -> E and S absent.

""NADIR"" -> A and R absent.

""NAVEL"" -> A and E absent.

Not working.

How about ""NUKED"" -> E absent.

""NYLON"" -> O and L? But O absent.

So let's consider the two candidates: ""INPUT"" and ""UNITY"".

We can also consider ""DINGY"" but we cannot because I would be in position 2? In ""DINGY"": D(1), I(2), N(3), G(4), Y(5). So I is in position 2 -> we know that is wrong, so we shouldn't. But if we use it, we might get I marked as present but wrong position? But we already know I is in the word and not in position 2. So it doesn't give new information about I's position. We want to test a new position for I.

Therefore, we prefer words that put I in a position we haven't tried: 1, 3, 4, or 5.

In ""INPUT"", I is in position 1 -> new.
In ""UNITY"", I is in position 3 -> new.

Both are good.

But ""INPUT"" has the advantage of having T and P, which are common.

""UNITY"" has U, T, Y.

We can also consider ""GUILD"" -> but we don't have N? We must include N because we know N is in the word. So we cannot skip N.

So we must include both I and N.

Another candidate: ""UNFIT"" -> U, N, F, I, T -> N in position 2, I in position 4? 
  Positions: U(1), N(2), F(3), I(4), T(5). 
  So I is in position 4 -> new. And N in 2 -> new.

  This is also a candidate.

But ""UNFIT"" uses F, which is less common? But we don't know.

We can choose among ""INPUT"", ""UNITY"", and ""UNFIT"".

But note: we have only 4 guesses left? We are on the third guess.

We want to maximize the information.

""INPUT"" and ""UNITY"" both have T, which is common.

But let's look at the positions:

We know:
- N is in the word, not in 4 or 5 -> so must be in 1,2,3.
- I is in the word, not in 2.

In ""INPUT"":
  I in 1 -> we test if I is in position 1.
  N in 2 -> test if N is in position 2.
  Then P, U, T.

In ""UNITY"":
  U in 1 -> test U in 1.
  N in 2 -> test N in 2.
  I in 3 -> test I in 3.
  T in 4, Y in 5.

""UNITY"" tests three positions for the known letters: N in 2, I in 3, and also U and Y.

But we don't know if U and Y are in the word.

Similarly, ""INPUT"" tests I in 1 and N in 2.

But ""UNITY"" covers more positions for the known letters? Specifically, it tests two new positions for the known letters (I in 3 and N in 2) and also two new letters (U, T, Y) but T is repeated.

Actually, ""UNITY"" has the advantage of testing I in a new position (3) and N in a new position (2) and also the letter U and Y.

But we have to consider that if the word has both I and N, and we are testing two positions at once, we might get multiple hits.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has N in position 3 and I in position 1 or 4 or 5.

For example: ""DIVAN"" -> but A absent and V? ""divan"" has A, which is absent.

""VINYL"" -> V, I, N, Y, L -> I in 2? Not allowed.

""WINCH"" -> C absent.

""MINIM"" -> duplicate I and M? But I in 2? Not allowed.

""KINKY"" -> K, I, N, K, Y -> I in 2? Not allowed.

""JINGO"" -> O absent.

""FIGHT"" -> F, I, G, H, T -> I in 2? Not allowed.

""LIGHT"" -> L, I, G, H, T -> I in 2? Not allowed.

So it's hard to find a word with N in 3 and I not in 2.

Therefore, let's go with one of the candidates.

I think ""UNITY"" is a good choice because:
  - It tests N in position 2 (which is a possible position)
  - It tests I in position 3 (new position)
  - It introduces three new letters: U, T, Y (and T is very common)

So we'll guess ""UNITY"".

But note: we have to make sure we are not using any absent letters. U, N, I, T, Y: none are in the absent list (A,B,C,E,O,R,S).

So it's valid.

Therefore, the third guess is ""UNITY"".

<guess>unity</guess>After analyzing the feedback:

- **Absent Letters**: C, R, A, E, B, S, O (cannot be in the word).
- **Present Letters (wrong position)**: 
  - N (must be in positions 1, 2, or 3, since it was wrong in positions 4 and 5).
  - I (must be in the word but not in position 2).
- **Goal for the next guess**: Test new positions for I and N while covering common unused letters (e.g., T, U, Y).

The word **""UNITY""** fits perfectly:
- Includes confirmed letters: **N** (in position 2) and **I** (in position 3, a new position to test).
- Avoids all absent letters.
- Introduces new common letters: **U**, **T**, and **Y**.
- Tests N in position 2 (previously untested) and I in position 3 (previously untested), maximizing positional information.

This guess will help narrow down the correct positions of I and N while checking for new letters.

Also, it does not contain C, R, A, E.\n\nWe must choose a new 5-letter word that:\n  - Does not contain C, R, A, E.\n  - Contains the letter N (but not in the 4th position? Actually, it can be in any position except the 4th? But note: the feedback says it\'s in the word but not in the 4th position. However, it might appear again? But we don\'t know. Since we only have one N in ""crane"", and it was marked as present, we know at least one N is in the word. But we don\'t know if there are more. However, the feedback doesn\'t indicate duplicates, so we assume at least one N.\n\nWe also want to cover new letters to get more information.\n\nLet\'s think of common letters that are still available. We have eliminated C, R, A, E.

For example, we might try words with S, T, L, O, etc.\n\nPossible words: \n  We know N is in the word, so we can put N in a different position (not 4th). Let\'s try to put N in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th position.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters. Since we only have one N in our guess and it was marked as present, we assume at least one N. But we don\'t know if there are more.\n\nWe should avoid using the same letter twice in this guess unless necessary? Actually, we can, but to maximize information, we might prefer distinct letters.\n\nLet me think of words that have N and other common letters, and without C, R, A, E.\n\nSome ideas:\n  - ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> but N is in the 4th position? We must avoid putting N in the 4th? Actually, no: the feedback only said that in the first guess, the N in the 4th position was wrong. But the word might have an N in the 4th and another N? But we don\'t know. However, to be safe, we should avoid putting N in the 4th position in this guess? Actually, we can put it anywhere because we are testing. But note: if we put N in the 4th again, and if the word has only one N and it is not in the 4th, then we will get a \'-\' again? But that doesn\'t give new information. So to test a new position, we should put N in a different position.\n\nAlternatively, we can put N in a position we haven\'t tried. We tried position 4. So we can try position 1, 2, 3, or 5.\n\nLet me try to form a word with N in position 1: \n  N _ _ _ _\n\nBut we need to avoid C, R, A, E. What words? \n  e.g., ""NOISY"" -> but has S and Y, but we don\'t know about them. However, we are trying to cover more common letters.\n\nBut note: we also want to cover vowels. We have O and I in ""NOISY"". \n\nBut let me think of more common words. Another idea: ""POINT"" has N in the 5th? Actually, ""POINT"" is P-O-I-N-T, so N is in the 4th? We want to avoid 4th? Then let\'s avoid.\n\nWe can try ""LIONS"": L-I-O-N-S -> N is in the 4th? Again 4th. \n\nHow about ""SNOWY"": S-N-O-W-Y -> N is in the 2nd position. That\'s different. And it avoids the 4th. Also, the letters S, N, O, W, Y are all new (except N) and we haven\'t tested them.\n\nBut note: we know N is in the word, so we are including it. The other letters S, O, W, Y are not eliminated.\n\nAlternatively, ""TONGS"": T-O-N-G-S -> N is in the 3rd position. That\'s also different.\n\nBut let\'s check the letters: T, O, N, G, S. All are new and not eliminated.\n\nAnother common word: ""POINT"" is not good because N is in 4th. ""SLING"": S-L-I-N-G -> N is in the 4th? Again 4th. \n\nWe can try ""STING"": S-T-I-N-G -> N is in the 4th? Same.\n\nHow about ""JOINT"": same.\n\nWe need a word with N not in the 4th. Let me think of words ending with N? Then N is in the 5th. For example: ""BRAIN"" -> but B and R? We know R is eliminated (from first feedback: R was x). So we cannot use R.\n\nWe cannot use R because it was absent.\n\nSo words without R, and without C, A, E.\n\nLet me try to form a word with N in the 5th: \n  _ _ _ _ N\n\nPossible words: ""CHAIN"" -> but C is out. ""PLAIN"" -> P-L-A-I-N -> A is out. ""TRAIN"" -> T-R-A-I-N -> R and A are out. \n\nSo we need a word without C, R, A, E and ending with N.\n\nExamples: ""MINION"" -> 6 letters. Too long.\n  ""UNION"" -> U-N-I-O-N -> but that\'s 5 letters? U, N, I, O, N -> has two N\'s. But we don\'t know if the word has two N\'s. Also, we are using N twice, which might not be efficient for getting new information.\n\nBut we can try: ""UNION"" -> but note: the word has two N\'s. We are going to guess U, N, I, O, N. The feedback might be: if the word has one N, then one of the N\'s might be correct (if in the right position) and the other might be absent? But the rules: if the letter is in the word, then each occurrence is marked. But if the word has only one N, then one of the N\'s in the guess will be marked as present (either in the correct position or wrong) and the other as absent? \n\nBut we don\'t want to use duplicate letters if we can avoid, to maximize information.\n\nSo let\'s avoid duplicates.\n\nAnother word: ""BISON"" -> B-I-S-O-N -> N is in the 5th. Letters: B, I, S, O, N. All new except N. And we avoid C, R, A, E.\n\nSimilarly, ""TOWNS"" -> T-O-W-N-S -> N is in the 4th? We are trying to avoid 4th? Actually, in ""TOWNS"", N is in the 4th? Let me count: T(1), O(2), W(3), N(4), S(5). So 4th. We want to avoid 4th? \n\nBut we can try a word with N in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th.\n\nLet me try for 5th: \n  ""BISON"": B-I-S-O-N -> positions: 1:B, 2:I, 3:S, 4:O, 5:N -> so N is in 5th. Good.\n\nAnother: ""LYNX"" -> too short? 4 letters. Not 5.\n\n""BEGIN"" -> B-E-G-I-N -> but E is out (from first feedback: E was x). So we cannot use E.\n\n""LOGIN"" -> L-O-G-I-N -> N in 5th. And no E, A, R, C. So that\'s good.\n\nBut we have two options: ""BISON"" and ""LOGIN"". \n\nWe can also consider ""POINT"" but N is in 4th? We want to avoid 4th? Actually, we don\'t have to strictly avoid, but it might be less informative if the word doesn\'t have an N in the 4th. But we can try a different position to get more information about the position of N.\n\nSo let\'s choose a word with N in a new position, say 5th.\n\nI\'ll go with ""BISON"": \n  - It has B, I, S, O, N. \n  - We haven\'t tested B, I, S, O.\n  - And we know N is in the word, so we are including it in a new position (5th).\n\nAlternatively, ""LOGIN"" is also good: L, O, G, I, N.\n\nBut which one has more common letters? Both are reasonable.\n\nWe can also consider ""POINT"" but N in 4th? We might get the same feedback for N? But if the word has N in 4th, then we get a check? But we don\'t know. So to test a new position, we choose 5th.\n\nAnother common word: ""SHOWN"" -> S-H-O-W-N -> N in 5th. But H and W are less common? \n\nI think ""BISON"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me check if ""BISON"" is a valid word: yes, it means a large animal.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""BISON"".\n\nBut note: we are not sure if the word has two N\'s? But we are only using one N, which is fine.\n\nSo the guess is ""BISON"".\n\nWe\'ll see the feedback and then adjust.\n\nTherefore, the next guess: ""bison""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, A, and E are **not** in the secret word.\n- N is in the word but **not in the 4th position**.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Must include N (since it\'s confirmed in the word) but avoid placing it in the 4th position to test a new location.\n- Avoid using C, R, A, or E.\n- Prioritize common unused letters (e.g., S, T, O, I, B) to maximize information.\n\nThe word ""bison"" fits these criteria:\n- Contains N in the 5th position (new position to test).\n- Uses new common letters: B, I, S, O.\n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, E).\n\nThis guess will help identify the correct position of N and reveal more about the secret word\'s letters.\n\n<guess>bison</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: bison -> FEEDBACK: B(x) I(-) S(x) O(x) N(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n\nFirst guess: ""crane""\n  C: x (not in word)\n  R: x (not in word)\n  A: x (not in word)\n  N: - (in word, wrong position)\n  E: x (not in word)\n\nSecond guess: ""bison""\n  B: x (not in word)\n  I: - (in word, wrong position)\n  S: x (not in word)\n  O: x (not in word)\n  N: - (in word, wrong position)\n\nFrom this, we can deduce:\n\nAbsent letters: C, R, A, E, B, S, O\nPresent letters (but in wrong position): N (from first guess) and I (from second guess), and also N again in the second guess (but it\'s the same N, so we know N is in the word, but not in position 4 or 5).\n\nSpecifically:\n- The secret word contains N, but not in position 4 (from first guess) and not in position 5 (from second guess). So N must be in one of positions 1, 2, or 3.\n- The secret word contains I, but not in position 2 (since in ""bison"", I was in position 2 and marked as wrong position). So I is in the word, but not at position 2.\n\nAlso, we have eliminated: A, B, C, E, O, R, S.\n\nSo the remaining letters to consider are: D, F, G, H, I (we know it\'s present), J, K, L, M, N (we know it\'s present), P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that:\n- Includes I and N (since they are present)\n- Does not include any of the absent letters: A, B, C, E, O, R, S.\n- Places N in either position 1, 2, or 3 (since it can\'t be in 4 or 5).\n- Places I in any position except 2 (since it was in position 2 and was wrong).\n\nAdditionally, we want to cover as many new letters as possible to get more information.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have I and N, and fit the constraints.\n\nPossible positions for N: 1, 2, 3.\n\nWe also note that I cannot be in position 2, so I can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\nBut we have to avoid the absent letters.\n\nLet me try to list some words:\n\nOption 1: N in position 1, I in position 3? \n  Example: ""N_T_I"" or similar.\n\nBut we need to fill the blanks.\n\nAnother idea: ""DINGY"" -> but we don\'t know about D, G, Y. However, note that we have to avoid O (which is absent) and others. But ""DINGY"" has D, I, N, G, Y. \n  - I is in position 2? But we cannot put I in position 2 because we know I is not in position 2 (from the feedback of ""bison""). So if we put I in position 2, we expect it to be wrong, but we want to test new positions? Actually, we know I is not in position 2, so we should avoid putting it there to not waste a position.\n\nSo in ""DINGY"", I is in position 2, which we know is wrong. So that would not be efficient because we already know that. We want to put I in a position we haven\'t tried.\n\nWe have only tried I in position 2 (in ""bison""). So we can try I in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\nSimilarly, for N, we have tried position 4 and 5, so we can try 1, 2, or 3.\n\nLet me try to form words:\n\n- If we put N in position 1 and I in position 3: \n  N _ I _ _\n  We need to fill the other positions with letters not in the absent list.\n\n  Possible: ""N T I P S"" -> but S is absent. Not allowed.\n  ""N U I T ?"" -> but we need a 5th letter. ""NUIT"" is 4 letters. \n  ""N U I T S"" -> S absent.\n\n  How about ""N O I S E"" -> but O and S and E are absent.\n\n  Not working.\n\n- Put N in position 1 and I in position 4:\n  N _ _ I _\n  Example: ""N A T I O"" -> A and O absent.\n  ""N E T I D"" -> E absent.\n\n  We need letters from the available set.\n\n  Available: D, F, G, H, I (but we are using it), J, K, L, M, N (using), P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n  So: ""N _ _ I _""\n\n  Possibilities: \n    ""N D G I T"" -> ""ndgit"" not a word.\n    ""N I G H T"" -> but I is in position 2? We are trying to put I in position 4? Actually, in ""NIGHT"", I is in position 3? Let\'s see: N(1), I(2), G(3), H(4), T(5). So I is in position 2, which we want to avoid.\n\n  We need I in position 4. So: \n    ""N _ _ I _""\n\n  How about ""L U N I T"" -> but that\'s L in position 1, not N. We are putting N in 1.\n\n  Another: ""N I L T I"" -> duplicate I and I in position 2? Not good.\n\n  How about ""N U L I N"" -> duplicate N and I in position 4? But we are trying to avoid duplicates? And N is in 1 and 5? We don\'t know if the word has two N\'s.\n\n  But let\'s think of common words: ""M U N I C"" -> C absent. \n  ""P U N I T"" -> P, U, N, I, T -> N in position 3? We are trying to put N in 1.\n\n  Maybe we should try N in position 2 or 3.\n\n- Put N in position 2 and I in position 1:\n  I N _ _ _\n  Example: ""I N K E D"" -> E absent.\n  ""I N T R O"" -> R and O absent.\n\n  We need: ""I N _ _ _""\n\n  With available letters: ""I N D E X"" -> E absent.\n  ""I N P U T"" -> P, U, T -> but we don\'t know about P, U, T. And no absent letters. So ""INPUT"" is a word.\n\n  But note: we have I in position 1 and N in position 2. We know I is in the word, but we don\'t know if it can be in position 1? We haven\'t tested position 1 for I. Similarly, we haven\'t tested position 2 for N? We tried N in 4 and 5, but not 2.\n\n  So ""INPUT"" could be a candidate.\n\n  However, we also have to consider that we know N is not in position 4 or 5, but position 2 is new. Similarly, I is not in position 2, but position 1 is new.\n\n  So ""INPUT"" uses I, N, P, U, T. All letters are either new or present (I and N). And we avoid absent letters.\n\n- Put N in position 2 and I in position 3:\n  _ I N _ _\n  Example: ""M I N T Y"" -> M, I, N, T, Y -> but I is in position 2? We know I cannot be in position 2. So we cannot put I in position 2.\n\n  We must avoid putting I in position 2.\n\n- Put N in position 2 and I in position 4:\n  _ I _ N _\n  But then I is in position 2 -> not allowed.\n\n- Put N in position 2 and I in position 5:\n  _ I _ _ N\n  Then I is in position 2 -> not allowed.\n\nSo if we put N in position 2, we cannot put I in the same word without putting I in a position we haven\'t tried? Because if we put N in 2, then the other positions for I are 1,3,4,5. But if we put I in 1, that\'s the case above (""INPUT""). If we put I in 3,4,5, then we have to avoid position 2 for I, which we are not using for I in that case? Actually, in the word, we are putting N in 2 and I in, say, 3: then the word has I in 3 and N in 2. But we are not putting I in 2, so that\'s okay. However, in the structure, if we have N in 2, then we can have I in 1,3,4,5.\n\nBut in the case of N in 2 and I in 3: \n  _ N I _ _ -> but wait, if N is in 2, then the first letter is something, then N in 2, then I in 3? So the word is like X N I Y Z.\n\nBut we can do that. For example: ""U N I T S"" -> but S absent. \n  ""U N I T Y"" -> U, N, I, T, Y -> but we have I in position 3? And we haven\'t tried I in position 3. So that\'s okay.\n\nBut we must avoid absent letters: so ""UNITY"" has U, N, I, T, Y. None of these are in the absent list (absent: A,B,C,E,O,R,S). So it\'s valid.\n\nBut note: we are using I in position 3, which is new.\n\nSimilarly, we can have ""UNIFY"", ""UNLIT"", etc.\n\nBut let\'s compare with the earlier ""INPUT"".\n\nNow, put N in position 3 and I in position 1:\n  I _ N _ _\n  Example: ""I M N P C"" -> not a word. \n  ""I D N A S"" -> absent letters.\n  ""I T N I S"" -> duplicate I and S absent.\n\n  How about ""I D N E A"" -> absent.\n\n  ""I N D I G"" -> but then I is in position 1 and 4? And N in position 2? We are trying to put N in 3? \n\n  We need: I in 1, then a letter, then N in 3.\n\n  Example: ""I L N T H"" -> not a word? ""ilnth"" no.\n  ""I N T N I"" -> not good.\n\n  Common word: ""INANE"" -> but A and E absent.\n\n  Not easy.\n\n- N in position 3 and I in position 4:\n  _ _ N I _\n  Example: ""T U N I C"" -> C absent.\n  ""T U N I S"" -> S absent.\n  ""D U N I T"" -> D, U, N, I, T -> ""dunit"" is a word? Or ""DUNIT""? Not common. \n  ""M U N I T"" -> M, U, N, I, T -> ""munit"" not a word.\n\n  How about ""MINTY"" -> but N is in position 3? M(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), Y(5). But then I is in position 2 -> we cannot because I cannot be in position 2.\n\n  We must avoid I in position 2.\n\n  So if we have N in 3, then I in 4: \n    _ _ N I _\n    Then the second position can be filled, but we cannot put I there. So we can put any letter except absent and except I? But we are not forced to put I in the second position.\n\n  Example: ""P I N I T"" -> I in position 2 and 4? We cannot have I in 2.\n\n  How about ""T O N I C"" -> O and C absent.\n\n  ""L U N I T"" -> L, U, N, I, T -> ""lunit"" not a word? But ""unlit"" is a word, but that\'s U in 1, N in 2, L in 3, I in 4, T in 5 -> then N is in 2, which we are considering separately.\n\n  Actually, for N in position 3, we can have: \n    ""B E N I G"" -> absent letters.\n\n  It\'s challenging.\n\nGiven the above, let\'s go back to the two candidates we have:\n\nCandidate 1: ""INPUT"" -> I in position 1, N in position 2, P, U, T.\nCandidate 2: ""UNITY"" -> U in position 1, N in position 2, I in position 3, T, Y.\n\nBut note: in ""UNITY"", we have I in position 3, which is acceptable because we haven\'t tested position 3 for I. And we know I is in the word but not in position 2.\n\nHowever, we also have to consider that we are using N in position 2 in both. We haven\'t tested N in position 2, so it could be correct or not.\n\nBut we want to maximize information. Both words use common letters.\n\nAnother candidate: ""NITRO"" -> but O and R are absent.\n\nNot valid.\n\n""PINTO"" -> O absent.\n\n""MINTS"" -> S absent.\n\n""LINGO"" -> O absent and we cannot use O.\n\n""THING"" -> T, H, I, N, G -> but I is in position 3? And N in position 4? We have tried N in 4 and 5, but not 3? Actually, in ""THING"": T(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), G(5). But we know N cannot be in position 4 (from first guess). So we cannot put N in 4. Therefore, ""THING"" is invalid because it puts N in 4.\n\nSimilarly, we must avoid putting N in 4 or 5.\n\nSo in our candidate ""INPUT"": N is in position 2 -> valid.\nIn ""UNITY"": N is in position 2 -> valid.\n\nBut we can also consider N in position 1 or 3.\n\nAnother idea: ""NEXUS"" -> E and S absent.\n\n""NADIR"" -> A and R absent.\n\n""NAVEL"" -> A and E absent.\n\nNot working.\n\nHow about ""NUKED"" -> E absent.\n\n""NYLON"" -> O and L? But O absent.\n\nSo let\'s consider the two candidates: ""INPUT"" and ""UNITY"".\n\nWe can also consider ""DINGY"" but we cannot because I would be in position 2? In ""DINGY"": D(1), I(2), N(3), G(4), Y(5). So I is in position 2 -> we know that is wrong, so we shouldn\'t. But if we use it, we might get I marked as present but wrong position? But we already know I is in the word and not in position 2. So it doesn\'t give new information about I\'s position. We want to test a new position for I.\n\nTherefore, we prefer words that put I in a position we haven\'t tried: 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\nIn ""INPUT"", I is in position 1 -> new.\nIn ""UNITY"", I is in position 3 -> new.\n\nBoth are good.\n\nBut ""INPUT"" has the advantage of having T and P, which are common.\n\n""UNITY"" has U, T, Y.\n\nWe can also consider ""GUILD"" -> but we don\'t have N? We must include N because we know N is in the word. So we cannot skip N.\n\nSo we must include both I and N.\n\nAnother candidate: ""UNFIT"" -> U, N, F, I, T -> N in position 2, I in position 4? \n  Positions: U(1), N(2), F(3), I(4), T(5). \n  So I is in position 4 -> new. And N in 2 -> new.\n\n  This is also a candidate.\n\nBut ""UNFIT"" uses F, which is less common? But we don\'t know.\n\nWe can choose among ""INPUT"", ""UNITY"", and ""UNFIT"".\n\nBut note: we have only 4 guesses left? We are on the third guess.\n\nWe want to maximize the information.\n\n""INPUT"" and ""UNITY"" both have T, which is common.\n\nBut let\'s look at the positions:\n\nWe know:\n- N is in the word, not in 4 or 5 -> so must be in 1,2,3.\n- I is in the word, not in 2.\n\nIn ""INPUT"":\n  I in 1 -> we test if I is in position 1.\n  N in 2 -> test if N is in position 2.\n  Then P, U, T.\n\nIn ""UNITY"":\n  U in 1 -> test U in 1.\n  N in 2 -> test N in 2.\n  I in 3 -> test I in 3.\n  T in 4, Y in 5.\n\n""UNITY"" tests three positions for the known letters: N in 2, I in 3, and also U and Y.\n\nBut we don\'t know if U and Y are in the word.\n\nSimilarly, ""INPUT"" tests I in 1 and N in 2.\n\nBut ""UNITY"" covers more positions for the known letters? Specifically, it tests two new positions for the known letters (I in 3 and N in 2) and also two new letters (U, T, Y) but T is repeated.\n\nActually, ""UNITY"" has the advantage of testing I in a new position (3) and N in a new position (2) and also the letter U and Y.\n\nBut we have to consider that if the word has both I and N, and we are testing two positions at once, we might get multiple hits.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has N in position 3 and I in position 1 or 4 or 5.\n\nFor example: ""DIVAN"" -> but A absent and V? ""divan"" has A, which is absent.\n\n""VINYL"" -> V, I, N, Y, L -> I in 2? Not allowed.\n\n""WINCH"" -> C absent.\n\n""MINIM"" -> duplicate I and M? But I in 2? Not allowed.\n\n""KINKY"" -> K, I, N, K, Y -> I in 2? Not allowed.\n\n""JINGO"" -> O absent.\n\n""FIGHT"" -> F, I, G, H, T -> I in 2? Not allowed.\n\n""LIGHT"" -> L, I, G, H, T -> I in 2? Not allowed.\n\nSo it\'s hard to find a word with N in 3 and I not in 2.\n\nTherefore, let\'s go with one of the candidates.\n\nI think ""UNITY"" is a good choice because:\n  - It tests N in position 2 (which is a possible position)\n  - It tests I in position 3 (new position)\n  - It introduces three new letters: U, T, Y (and T is very common)\n\nSo we\'ll guess ""UNITY"".\n\nBut note: we have to make sure we are not using any absent letters. U, N, I, T, Y: none are in the absent list (A,B,C,E,O,R,S).\n\nSo it\'s valid.\n\nTherefore, the third guess is ""UNITY"".\n\n<guess>unity</guess>After analyzing the feedback:\n\n- **Absent Letters**: C, R, A, E, B, S, O (cannot be in the word).\n- **Present Letters (wrong position)**: \n  - N (must be in positions 1, 2, or 3, since it was wrong in positions 4 and 5).\n  - I (must be in the word but not in position 2).\n- **Goal for the next guess**: Test new positions for I and N while covering common unused letters (e.g., T, U, Y).\n\nThe word **""UNITY""** fits perfectly:\n- Includes confirmed letters: **N** (in position 2) and **I** (in position 3, a new position to test).\n- Avoids all absent letters.\n- Introduces new common letters: **U**, **T**, and **Y**.\n- Tests N in position 2 (previously untested) and I in position 3 (previously untested), maximizing positional information.\n\nThis guess will help narrow down the correct positions of I and N while checking for new letters.\n\n<guess>unity</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: bison -> FEEDBACK: B(x) I(-) S(x) O(x) N(-)\nGuess 3: unity -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(✓) I(-) T(-) Y(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for the third guess ""unity"":
  U: - (in the word but wrong position)
  N: ✓ (correct letter and position)
  I: - (in the word but wrong position)
  T: - (in the word but wrong position)
  Y: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The secret word has the letter N in the second position (since it's marked correct).
- The letters U, I, T are in the word but not in the positions we guessed (U not in 1st, I not in 3rd, T not in 4th).
- Y is not in the word.

Additionally, we have the previous feedback:
- From guess 1: C, R, A, E are absent, and N is present (which we now know is in position 2).
- From guess 2: B, S, O are absent, and I is present (but not in position 2, which we already knew and now also not in position 3).

So, to summarize:
- Correct position: 
    Position 2: N
- Present letters (but wrong positions): U, I, T
- Absent letters: A, B, C, E, O, R, S, Y
- We also know that I cannot be in position 2 or 3, and T cannot be in position 4, and U cannot be in position 1.

The secret word has the following structure:
  _ N _ _ _

And it must contain the letters U, I, T (each at least once) and N (which we have fixed at position 2). Also, the word is 5 letters.

We need to assign U, I, T to the remaining positions: 1, 3, 4, 5, but with constraints:
- U cannot be in position 1 (from feedback of ""unity"")
- I cannot be in position 2 (from ""bison"") or position 3 (from ""unity"")
- T cannot be in position 4 (from ""unity"")

Also, note that the word has 5 letters and we have 4 positions to fill (1,3,4,5) but we have 3 letters (U, I, T) to place. That means one of the positions must be a new letter? Or one of the letters might appear twice? But we don't know.

We must consider that the word might have duplicate letters, but so far we don't have evidence.

The known letters are U, I, T, N. And we have 5 positions. So the fifth letter must be a new letter that we haven't guessed yet (and not absent).

Available positions: 1, 3, 4, 5.

Constraints:
- Position 1: cannot be U (because U is present but not in position 1) and cannot be I? We don't know about I in position 1. Similarly, T can be in position 1? We haven't tested T in position 1.
- Position 3: cannot be I (because I is present but not in position 3) and cannot be U? We don't know about U in position 3. Similarly, T can be in position 3? We haven't tested T in position 3.
- Position 4: cannot be T (because T is present but not in position 4) and cannot be U? We don't know. Similarly, I can be in position 4? We haven't tested I in position 4.
- Position 5: no restrictions from feedback for U, I, T? We haven't tested any of them in position 5.

So, for the letters:
- U: cannot be in 1, so must be in 3,4, or 5.
- I: cannot be in 2 or 3, so must be in 1,4, or 5.
- T: cannot be in 4, so must be in 1,3, or 5.

We also need to choose a fifth letter. The absent letters are: A,B,C,E,O,R,S,Y. So available letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We want to form a word that fits: _ N _ _ _

And contains U, I, T, and one more letter (or possibly a duplicate, but let's avoid for now to maximize information).

We can try to assign the letters to positions.

Let me list possible positions for each:

Position 1: can be I, T, or a new letter (since U is not allowed). But if we put I or T in position 1, that's acceptable.

Similarly, position 3: can be U, T, or a new letter (I not allowed).

Position 4: can be U, I, or a new letter (T not allowed).

Position 5: can be U, I, T, or a new letter.

We have to cover all three letters: U, I, T.

We can try to form words.

One approach: since we know N is fixed at 2, we can look for words that have N in the second position and contain U, I, T.

Common words: 
  ""UNITY"" we already tried, but we know it's not that because we got feedback.

We need a different word.

Possible words:

- If we put I in position 1: 
  I N _ _ _
  Then we need to place U and T in 3,4,5 and one more letter? But we have three positions and two letters? So one position must be a new letter.

  Example: ""I N _ _ _""

  We have to fill with U, T, and one more.

  But U cannot be in 1 (already taken by I) and we are putting I in 1, which is allowed.

  U can be in 3,4,5; T can be in 3,4,5 but not 4? T cannot be in 4, so T must be in 3 or 5.

  Let's try:

  Option: T in position 3: then we have ""I N T _ _""
    Then we need to place U and one more letter in 4 and 5.
    But T is in 3, which is allowed? We haven't tested T in 3. And U can be in 4 or 5.

    If U in 4: ""I N T U _"", then we need a fifth letter for position 5. What word? ""INTU?"" -> ""INTUB"" (not a word), ""INTUE"" (E absent), ""INTUS"" (S absent). Not working.

    If U in 5: ""I N T _ U"", then we need a letter for position 4. ""INT?U"" -> ""INTU"" is not a word. ""INTRO"" -> O and R absent. ""INTHU"" not a word.

  Option: T in position 5: then ""I N _ _ T""
    Then we need to place U in 3 or 4? 
    If U in 3: ""I N U _ T"" -> ""INPUT"" we already tried? But we tried ""INPUT"" as the second guess? No, we tried ""bison"" and then ""unity"". We did not try ""INPUT"". But in the second guess we considered ""INPUT"" but didn't use it? Actually, we used ""bison"". So ""INPUT"" is still available? But note: in ""INPUT"", we have I in 1, N in 2, P, U, T. And T is in 5? ""INPUT"": I(1), N(2), P(3), U(4), T(5). 

    But in our feedback for ""unity"", we know that T is in the word but not in position 4. In ""INPUT"", T is in position 5, which is fine. Also, U is in position 4, which we haven't tested? But in the feedback for ""unity"", U is present but not in position 1, so it could be in 4.

    However, we also know that I is present and not in position 3 (from ""unity""), but in ""INPUT"", I is in position 1, which is allowed.

    But we must check if ""INPUT"" uses any absent letters: P is not in the absent list? Absent: A,B,C,E,O,R,S,Y. So P is allowed.

    So ""INPUT"" is a candidate? But we have to see if it fits the feedback.

    However, we already have the feedback that U is present and not in 1, and T is present and not in 4. In ""INPUT"", U is in 4 and T is in 5. So that matches the constraints.

    Also, I is in 1, which is a new position for I.

    But we also have a new letter P.

    However, we are missing: we know the word must have U, I, T, and N. ""INPUT"" has I, N, P, U, T -> so it has all of them? It has U, I, T, and N. And P is extra.

    But the word has 5 letters, so that's fine.

    But we haven't used the feedback about U being in the word? We know U is in the word, and in ""INPUT"" it is in position 4.

    But is ""INPUT"" the secret word? We don't know, but we can guess it.

    However, we have to consider if we can form a word without introducing a new letter? But we have to, because we have three letters to place and four positions? Actually, we have four positions and three letters (U, I, T) plus one new letter? Or we can have a duplicate? But we don't know.

    Alternatively, we can try to put the three letters in the remaining positions without a new letter? That would require one of the letters to be duplicated? But we don't know which one.

    But let's see: if we don't introduce a new letter, then we must have one of U, I, T duplicated. For example, the word might have two T's? Or two U's? Or two I's?

    But we don't have evidence.

    However, we can try to form words without a new letter.

    For example, if we put I in position 1, then we have to put U and T in the remaining three positions? But we have three positions: 3,4,5. We need to put two letters? So one position must be a duplicate? 

    For instance, ""I N T U T"" -> ""intut"" not a word.

    ""I N U T U"" -> ""inutu"" not a word.

    ""I N U U T"" -> ""inuut"" not a word.

    So it's hard.

    Therefore, we need a new letter.

    So ""INPUT"" is a candidate.

- Another possibility: put T in position 1.
  T N _ _ _
  Then we need to place U and I in 3,4,5 and one more letter.

  Constraints: 
    U cannot be in 1 (but we are using T in 1, so okay).
    I cannot be in 2 or 3, so I can be in 4 or 5.
    T is in 1, which is allowed? We haven't tested T in 1.

  Example: ""T N _ _ _""

  We can put I in 4: then ""T N _ I _""
    Then we need to place U and one more letter in 3 and 5.
    U can be in 3 or 5.

    If U in 3: ""T N U I _"", then we need a fifth letter for 5. ""TNU I ?"" -> ""TNUIA"" not a word. ""TNUIS"" S absent.

    If U in 5: ""T N _ I U"", then we need a letter for 3. ""TN?IU"" -> ""TNDIU"" not a word, ""TNLIU"" not a word.

  Put I in 5: ""T N _ _ I""
    Then U in 3 or 4.
    If U in 3: ""T N U _ I"" -> ""TNU?I"" -> ""TNULI"" not a word, ""TNUXI"" not a word.
    If U in 4: ""T N _ U I"" -> ""TN?UI"" -> ""TNDUI"" not a word, ""TNPUI"" not a word.

  Not working.

- Put U in position 1? But we know U cannot be in position 1 (from ""unity"" feedback: U is present but not in 1). So we cannot put U in 1.

- Put I in position 4: 
  _ N _ I _
  Then we need to place U and T in 1,3,5? But we have three positions and two letters? So one new letter.

  Constraints: 
    Position 1: cannot be U (because U not in 1) and can be T? 
    Position 3: can be U or T? But T cannot be in 4? We are putting I in 4, so T can be in 3? 
    Position 5: can be U or T.

  Also, I is in 4, which is allowed? We haven't tested I in 4.

  Example: 
    If we put T in 1: ""T N _ I _""
      Then we need to place U in 3 or 5 and one new letter in the other.
      If U in 3: ""T N U I _"", then we need a fifth letter for 5. ""TNU I ?"" -> same as before, hard.
      If U in 5: ""T N _ I U"", then we need a letter for 3. ""TN?IU"" -> ""TNDIU"" not a word.

    If we put T in 3: ""T N T I ?"" -> duplicate T? ""TNTI?"" -> not a word.

    If we put T in 5: ""T N _ I T"" -> then we need a letter for 3. ""TN?IT"" -> ""TNDIT"" not a word, ""TNPIT"" -> ""PIT"" is a word? ""TNPIT"" not a word.

    If we put a new letter in 1: then ""X N _ I _"", and we need to place U and T in 3 and 5? But we have two positions and two letters.

    For example: ""X N U I T"" -> but then T is in 5, which is allowed? And U in 3, which is allowed? And I in 4, allowed.

    What is X? We need a letter from the available set.

    Example: ""D N U I T"" -> ""DNUIT"" not a word.
    ""G N U I T"" -> ""gnuit"" not a word.
    ""P N U I T"" -> ""PNUIT"" not a word.

    ""L N U I T"" -> ""LNUIT"" not a word.

    ""M N U I T"" -> ""minuit"" is a word? But ""minuit"" is 6 letters? No, ""minuit"" is 6? M-I-N-U-I-T -> 6 letters. We need 5.

    How about ""UNITE"" -> but E absent and U in 1? We cannot put U in 1.

    Not working.

- Put I in position 5: 
  _ N _ _ I
  Then we need to place U and T in 1,3,4? But we have three positions and two letters? So one new letter.

  Constraints:
    Position 1: cannot be U, so must be T or new letter.
    Position 3: can be U or T? 
    Position 4: can be U? But T cannot be in 4.

  Example:
    If we put T in 1: ""T N _ _ I""
      Then we need to place U in 3 or 4.
      If U in 3: ""T N U _ I"" -> then we need a letter for 4. ""TNU?I"" -> ""TNULI"" not a word.
      If U in 4: ""T N _ U I"" -> then we need a letter for 3. ""TN?UI"" -> ""TNDUI"" not a word.

    If we put a new letter in 1: ""X N _ _ I""
      Then we need to place U and T in 3 and 4? But T cannot be in 4. So T must be in 3? Then U in 4? 
      So ""X N T U I"" -> ""XNTUI"" -> what X? 
        ""ANTUI"" -> A absent.
        ""ENTUI"" -> E absent.
        ""INTUI"" -> I is already in 5? And we have I in 5 and also in the word? But ""INTUI"" has I in 1 and 5? But we are putting X in 1, which is not I. So ""INTUI"" is not matching.

      We need a consonant: ""D N T U I"" -> ""DNTUI"" not a word.
      ""G N T U I"" -> ""GNTUI"" not a word.
      ""P N T U I"" -> ""PNTUI"" not a word.

    Not working.

- Put U in position 3: 
  _ N U _ _
  Then we need to place I and T in 1,4,5? But we have three positions and two letters? So one new letter.

  Constraints:
    Position 1: cannot be U (already used in 3? But we are not putting U in 1) and can be I or T? 
    I cannot be in 2 or 3, so I can be in 1,4,5.
    T cannot be in 4, so T can be in 1 or 5.

  Example:
    If we put I in 1: ""I N U _ _""
      Then we need to place T in 5 (since T cannot be in 4) and a new letter in 4.
      So ""I N U X T""
      What is X? Available letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.
      Example: ""I N U P T"" -> ""INPUT"" again! 
        But in ""INPUT"", we have I in 1, N in 2, U in 4? Wait, no: ""INPUT"" is I, N, P, U, T -> so positions: I(1), N(2), P(3), U(4), T(5). 
        But here we are putting U in 3? So it's different: we are trying ""I N U X T"", which would be position 3: U, but in ""INPUT"" position 3 is P.

      So we are considering a different word: ""INUKT"" not a word, ""INULT"" not a word, ""INUST"" S absent.

      But note: we are putting U in position 3, which is allowed? We haven't tested U in 3.

      But we need a word: ""INUPT"" -> not a word? ""INPUT"" has P in 3 and U in 4.

      How about ""INUST"" -> S absent.

      Not working.

    If we put T in 1: ""T N U _ _""
      Then we need to place I in 4 or 5 and a new letter in the other? Or if we put I in 4, then we need a letter for 5, but T is in 1, U in 3, so we have positions 4 and 5 for I and a new letter? But I can be in 4 or 5.

      If I in 4: ""T N U I _"", then we need a letter for 5. ""TNU I ?"" -> ""TNUI?"" -> ""TNUIS"" S absent, ""TNUIT"" -> ""TNUIT"" not a word.

      If I in 5: ""T N U _ I"", then we need a letter for 4. ""TNU?I"" -> ""TNULI"" not a word.

    If we put a new letter in 1: ""X N U _ _""
      Then we need to place I and T in 4 and 5? But T cannot be in 4, so T must be in 5? Then I in 4? 
      So ""X N U I T""
      But I in 4: we haven't tested I in 4, so it's allowed? And T in 5, allowed.
      What is X? 
        ""D N U I T"" -> ""DNUIT"" not a word.
        ""G N U I T"" -> ""GNUIT"" not a word.
        ""L N U I T"" -> ""LNUIT"" not a word.
        ""P N U I T"" -> ""PNUIT"" not a word.

      Not working.

- Put U in position 4: 
  _ N _ U _
  Then we need to place I and T in 1,3,5? But we have three positions and two letters? So one new letter.

  Constraints:
    Position 1: cannot be U, so I or T or new.
    Position 3: can be I? But I cannot be in 3? So I cannot be in 3. Therefore, position 3 must be T or new? But T can be in 3.
    Position 5: can be I or T? But T cannot be in 4 (already used) but 5 is fine.

  Also, U is in 4, which is allowed? We haven't tested U in 4.

  Example:
    If we put I in 1: ""I N _ U _""
      Then we need to place T in 3 or 5 and a new letter in the other? 
      If T in 3: ""I N T U _"", then we need a letter for 5. ""INTU?"" -> ""INTUP"" -> ""INTUP"" not a word, ""INTUS"" S absent.
      If T in 5: ""I N _ U T"", then we need a letter for 3. ""IN?UT"" -> ""INPUT"" -> which is I(1), N(2), P(3), U(4), T(5). This is the word ""INPUT"".

    If we put T in 1: ""T N _ U _""
      Then we need to place I in 5 (since I cannot be in 3) and a new letter in 3.
      So ""T N X U I""
      Example: ""T N D U I"" -> ""TNDUI"" not a word.

    If we put a new letter in 1: ""X N _ U _""
      Then we need to place I and T in 3 and 5? But I cannot be in 3, so I must be in 5? Then T must be in 3? 
      So ""X N T U I""
      Example: ""D N T U I"" -> ""DNTUI"" not a word.

- Put U in position 5: 
  _ N _ _ U
  Then we need to place I and T in 1,3,4? But we have three positions and two letters? So one new letter.

  Constraints:
    Position 1: cannot be U, so I or T or new.
    Position 3: can be T? But I cannot be in 3, so if we put I in 3, not allowed. So position 3 must be T or new.
    Position 4: can be I? But T cannot be in 4.

  Example:
    If we put I in 1: ""I N _ _ U""
      Then we need to place T in 3 (since T cannot be in 4) and a new letter in 4? Or T in 3 and new in 4? 
      ""I N T ? U"" -> ""INT?U"" -> ""INTXU"" not a word.
      Or if we put T in 3 and then a letter in 4: ""I N T X U"", which is ""INTXU"" not a word.

    If we put T in 1: ""T N _ _ U""
      Then we need to place I in 4 (since I cannot be in 3) and a new letter in 3? But position 3 must be filled. 
      ""T N X I U"" -> ""T N X I U"", and I is in 4, which is allowed? We haven't tested I in 4.
      Example: ""T N D I U"" -> ""TNDIU"" not a word.

    If we put a new letter in 1: ""X N _ _ U""
      Then we need to place I and T in 3 and 4? But I cannot be in 3, and T cannot be in 4. So we cannot put I in 3 or T in 4. 
      Therefore, we must put T in 3 and I in 4? 
      So ""X N T I U""
      Example: ""D N T I U"" -> ""DNTIU"" not a word.

After exploring, the only common word that fits is ""INPUT"". 

Let me double-check if ""INPUT"" satisfies all the feedback:

- Secret word: ? ? ? ? ? 
- We are guessing: I N P U T

Feedback from previous guesses:

1. ""crane"": 
   C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x) -> N is present but not in position 4. In ""INPUT"", N is in position 2, so that matches. The other letters (C,R,A,E) are absent, and ""INPUT"" doesn't have them.

2. ""bison"":
   B(x), I(-), S(x), O(x), N(-) -> I is present but not in position 2, and N is present but not in position 5. In ""INPUT"", I is in position 1 (not 2) and N is in position 2 (not 5), so that matches.

3. ""unity"":
   U(-), N(✓), I(-), T(-), Y(x) -> 
   - U is present but not in position 1: in ""INPUT"", U is in position 4, so not 1 -> matches.
   - N is correct in position 2: matches.
   - I is present but not in position 3: in ""INPUT"", I is in position 1, not 3 -> matches.
   - T is present but not in position 4: in ""INPUT"", T is in position 5, not 4 -> matches.
   - Y is absent: ""INPUT"" has no Y -> matches.

Also, the word ""INPUT"" is a valid 5-letter word.

Therefore, we can guess ""INPUT"".

But note: we have already used ""bison"" and ""unity"", but not ""input"". So it's a new guess.

So the next guess is ""INPUT"".

<guess>input</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **N is confirmed in position 2** (from ""unity"" feedback: N✓).
- **U, I, T are present** but in wrong positions (U-, I-, T- in ""unity"").
- **Y is absent** (Yx in ""unity"").
- **Absent letters**: A, B, C, E, O, R, S, Y (from all feedback).
- **Position constraints**:
  - U cannot be in position 1 (from ""unity"").
  - I cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from ""bison"" and ""unity"").
  - T cannot be in position 4 (from ""unity"").

The secret word structure is: `_ N _ _ _`  
and must include U, I, T in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (with constraints).

After evaluating possible words that fit these constraints and include only unused letters (D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z), **""INPUT""** is the optimal guess because:
- **I** is in position 1 (new position, allowed).
- **N** is in position 2 (confirmed).
- **P** is a new letter (not tested).
- **U** is in position 4 (new position, allowed since U≠1).
- **T** is in position 5 (new position, allowed since T≠4).

This guess tests all remaining letters (U, I, T) in new positions while introducing P, maximizing information for the next move.

<guess>input</guess>",input,"We are given feedback for the third guess ""unity"":
  U: - (in the word but wrong position)
  N: ✓ (correct letter and position)
  I: - (in the word but wrong position)
  T: - (in the word but wrong position)
  Y: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The secret word has the letter N in the second position (since it's marked correct).
- The letters U, I, T are in the word but not in the positions we guessed (U not in 1st, I not in 3rd, T not in 4th).
- Y is not in the word.

Additionally, we have the previous feedback:
- From guess 1: C, R, A, E are absent, and N is present (which we now know is in position 2).
- From guess 2: B, S, O are absent, and I is present (but not in position 2, which we already knew and now also not in position 3).

So, to summarize:
- Correct position: 
    Position 2: N
- Present letters (but wrong positions): U, I, T
- Absent letters: A, B, C, E, O, R, S, Y
- We also know that I cannot be in position 2 or 3, and T cannot be in position 4, and U cannot be in position 1.

The secret word has the following structure:
  _ N _ _ _

And it must contain the letters U, I, T (each at least once) and N (which we have fixed at position 2). Also, the word is 5 letters.

We need to assign U, I, T to the remaining positions: 1, 3, 4, 5, but with constraints:
- U cannot be in position 1 (from feedback of ""unity"")
- I cannot be in position 2 (from ""bison"") or position 3 (from ""unity"")
- T cannot be in position 4 (from ""unity"")

Also, note that the word has 5 letters and we have 4 positions to fill (1,3,4,5) but we have 3 letters (U, I, T) to place. That means one of the positions must be a new letter? Or one of the letters might appear twice? But we don't know.

We must consider that the word might have duplicate letters, but so far we don't have evidence.

The known letters are U, I, T, N. And we have 5 positions. So the fifth letter must be a new letter that we haven't guessed yet (and not absent).

Available positions: 1, 3, 4, 5.

Constraints:
- Position 1: cannot be U (because U is present but not in position 1) and cannot be I? We don't know about I in position 1. Similarly, T can be in position 1? We haven't tested T in position 1.
- Position 3: cannot be I (because I is present but not in position 3) and cannot be U? We don't know about U in position 3. Similarly, T can be in position 3? We haven't tested T in position 3.
- Position 4: cannot be T (because T is present but not in position 4) and cannot be U? We don't know. Similarly, I can be in position 4? We haven't tested I in position 4.
- Position 5: no restrictions from feedback for U, I, T? We haven't tested any of them in position 5.

So, for the letters:
- U: cannot be in 1, so must be in 3,4, or 5.
- I: cannot be in 2 or 3, so must be in 1,4, or 5.
- T: cannot be in 4, so must be in 1,3, or 5.

We also need to choose a fifth letter. The absent letters are: A,B,C,E,O,R,S,Y. So available letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We want to form a word that fits: _ N _ _ _

And contains U, I, T, and one more letter (or possibly a duplicate, but let's avoid for now to maximize information).

We can try to assign the letters to positions.

Let me list possible positions for each:

Position 1: can be I, T, or a new letter (since U is not allowed). But if we put I or T in position 1, that's acceptable.

Similarly, position 3: can be U, T, or a new letter (I not allowed).

Position 4: can be U, I, or a new letter (T not allowed).

Position 5: can be U, I, T, or a new letter.

We have to cover all three letters: U, I, T.

We can try to form words.

One approach: since we know N is fixed at 2, we can look for words that have N in the second position and contain U, I, T.

Common words: 
  ""UNITY"" we already tried, but we know it's not that because we got feedback.

We need a different word.

Possible words:

- If we put I in position 1: 
  I N _ _ _
  Then we need to place U and T in 3,4,5 and one more letter? But we have three positions and two letters? So one position must be a new letter.

  Example: ""I N _ _ _""

  We have to fill with U, T, and one more.

  But U cannot be in 1 (already taken by I) and we are putting I in 1, which is allowed.

  U can be in 3,4,5; T can be in 3,4,5 but not 4? T cannot be in 4, so T must be in 3 or 5.

  Let's try:

  Option: T in position 3: then we have ""I N T _ _""
    Then we need to place U and one more letter in 4 and 5.
    But T is in 3, which is allowed? We haven't tested T in 3. And U can be in 4 or 5.

    If U in 4: ""I N T U _"", then we need a fifth letter for position 5. What word? ""INTU?"" -> ""INTUB"" (not a word), ""INTUE"" (E absent), ""INTUS"" (S absent). Not working.

    If U in 5: ""I N T _ U"", then we need a letter for position 4. ""INT?U"" -> ""INTU"" is not a word. ""INTRO"" -> O and R absent. ""INTHU"" not a word.

  Option: T in position 5: then ""I N _ _ T""
    Then we need to place U in 3 or 4? 
    If U in 3: ""I N U _ T"" -> ""INPUT"" we already tried? But we tried ""INPUT"" as the second guess? No, we tried ""bison"" and then ""unity"". We did not try ""INPUT"". But in the second guess we considered ""INPUT"" but didn't use it? Actually, we used ""bison"". So ""INPUT"" is still available? But note: in ""INPUT"", we have I in 1, N in 2, P, U, T. And T is in 5? ""INPUT"": I(1), N(2), P(3), U(4), T(5). 

    But in our feedback for ""unity"", we know that T is in the word but not in position 4. In ""INPUT"", T is in position 5, which is fine. Also, U is in position 4, which we haven't tested? But in the feedback for ""unity"", U is present but not in position 1, so it could be in 4.

    However, we also know that I is present and not in position 3 (from ""unity""), but in ""INPUT"", I is in position 1, which is allowed.

    But we must check if ""INPUT"" uses any absent letters: P is not in the absent list? Absent: A,B,C,E,O,R,S,Y. So P is allowed.

    So ""INPUT"" is a candidate? But we have to see if it fits the feedback.

    However, we already have the feedback that U is present and not in 1, and T is present and not in 4. In ""INPUT"", U is in 4 and T is in 5. So that matches the constraints.

    Also, I is in 1, which is a new position for I.

    But we also have a new letter P.

    However, we are missing: we know the word must have U, I, T, and N. ""INPUT"" has I, N, P, U, T -> so it has all of them? It has U, I, T, and N. And P is extra.

    But the word has 5 letters, so that's fine.

    But we haven't used the feedback about U being in the word? We know U is in the word, and in ""INPUT"" it is in position 4.

    But is ""INPUT"" the secret word? We don't know, but we can guess it.

    However, we have to consider if we can form a word without introducing a new letter? But we have to, because we have three letters to place and four positions? Actually, we have four positions and three letters (U, I, T) plus one new letter? Or we can have a duplicate? But we don't know.

    Alternatively, we can try to put the three letters in the remaining positions without a new letter? That would require one of the letters to be duplicated? But we don't know which one.

    But let's see: if we don't introduce a new letter, then we must have one of U, I, T duplicated. For example, the word might have two T's? Or two U's? Or two I's?

    But we don't have evidence.

    However, we can try to form words without a new letter.

    For example, if we put I in position 1, then we have to put U and T in the remaining three positions? But we have three positions: 3,4,5. We need to put two letters? So one position must be a duplicate? 

    For instance, ""I N T U T"" -> ""intut"" not a word.

    ""I N U T U"" -> ""inutu"" not a word.

    ""I N U U T"" -> ""inuut"" not a word.

    So it's hard.

    Therefore, we need a new letter.

    So ""INPUT"" is a candidate.

- Another possibility: put T in position 1.
  T N _ _ _
  Then we need to place U and I in 3,4,5 and one more letter.

  Constraints: 
    U cannot be in 1 (but we are using T in 1, so okay).
    I cannot be in 2 or 3, so I can be in 4 or 5.
    T is in 1, which is allowed? We haven't tested T in 1.

  Example: ""T N _ _ _""

  We can put I in 4: then ""T N _ I _""
    Then we need to place U and one more letter in 3 and 5.
    U can be in 3 or 5.

    If U in 3: ""T N U I _"", then we need a fifth letter for 5. ""TNU I ?"" -> ""TNUIA"" not a word. ""TNUIS"" S absent.

    If U in 5: ""T N _ I U"", then we need a letter for 3. ""TN?IU"" -> ""TNDIU"" not a word, ""TNLIU"" not a word.

  Put I in 5: ""T N _ _ I""
    Then U in 3 or 4.
    If U in 3: ""T N U _ I"" -> ""TNU?I"" -> ""TNULI"" not a word, ""TNUXI"" not a word.
    If U in 4: ""T N _ U I"" -> ""TN?UI"" -> ""TNDUI"" not a word, ""TNPUI"" not a word.

  Not working.

- Put U in position 1? But we know U cannot be in position 1 (from ""unity"" feedback: U is present but not in 1). So we cannot put U in 1.

- Put I in position 4: 
  _ N _ I _
  Then we need to place U and T in 1,3,5? But we have three positions and two letters? So one new letter.

  Constraints: 
    Position 1: cannot be U (because U not in 1) and can be T? 
    Position 3: can be U or T? But T cannot be in 4? We are putting I in 4, so T can be in 3? 
    Position 5: can be U or T.

  Also, I is in 4, which is allowed? We haven't tested I in 4.

  Example: 
    If we put T in 1: ""T N _ I _""
      Then we need to place U in 3 or 5 and one new letter in the other.
      If U in 3: ""T N U I _"", then we need a fifth letter for 5. ""TNU I ?"" -> same as before, hard.
      If U in 5: ""T N _ I U"", then we need a letter for 3. ""TN?IU"" -> ""TNDIU"" not a word.

    If we put T in 3: ""T N T I ?"" -> duplicate T? ""TNTI?"" -> not a word.

    If we put T in 5: ""T N _ I T"" -> then we need a letter for 3. ""TN?IT"" -> ""TNDIT"" not a word, ""TNPIT"" -> ""PIT"" is a word? ""TNPIT"" not a word.

    If we put a new letter in 1: then ""X N _ I _"", and we need to place U and T in 3 and 5? But we have two positions and two letters.

    For example: ""X N U I T"" -> but then T is in 5, which is allowed? And U in 3, which is allowed? And I in 4, allowed.

    What is X? We need a letter from the available set.

    Example: ""D N U I T"" -> ""DNUIT"" not a word.
    ""G N U I T"" -> ""gnuit"" not a word.
    ""P N U I T"" -> ""PNUIT"" not a word.

    ""L N U I T"" -> ""LNUIT"" not a word.

    ""M N U I T"" -> ""minuit"" is a word? But ""minuit"" is 6 letters? No, ""minuit"" is 6? M-I-N-U-I-T -> 6 letters. We need 5.

    How about ""UNITE"" -> but E absent and U in 1? We cannot put U in 1.

    Not working.

- Put I in position 5: 
  _ N _ _ I
  Then we need to place U and T in 1,3,4? But we have three positions and two letters? So one new letter.

  Constraints:
    Position 1: cannot be U, so must be T or new letter.
    Position 3: can be U or T? 
    Position 4: can be U? But T cannot be in 4.

  Example:
    If we put T in 1: ""T N _ _ I""
      Then we need to place U in 3 or 4.
      If U in 3: ""T N U _ I"" -> then we need a letter for 4. ""TNU?I"" -> ""TNULI"" not a word.
      If U in 4: ""T N _ U I"" -> then we need a letter for 3. ""TN?UI"" -> ""TNDUI"" not a word.

    If we put a new letter in 1: ""X N _ _ I""
      Then we need to place U and T in 3 and 4? But T cannot be in 4. So T must be in 3? Then U in 4? 
      So ""X N T U I"" -> ""XNTUI"" -> what X? 
        ""ANTUI"" -> A absent.
        ""ENTUI"" -> E absent.
        ""INTUI"" -> I is already in 5? And we have I in 5 and also in the word? But ""INTUI"" has I in 1 and 5? But we are putting X in 1, which is not I. So ""INTUI"" is not matching.

      We need a consonant: ""D N T U I"" -> ""DNTUI"" not a word.
      ""G N T U I"" -> ""GNTUI"" not a word.
      ""P N T U I"" -> ""PNTUI"" not a word.

    Not working.

- Put U in position 3: 
  _ N U _ _
  Then we need to place I and T in 1,4,5? But we have three positions and two letters? So one new letter.

  Constraints:
    Position 1: cannot be U (already used in 3? But we are not putting U in 1) and can be I or T? 
    I cannot be in 2 or 3, so I can be in 1,4,5.
    T cannot be in 4, so T can be in 1 or 5.

  Example:
    If we put I in 1: ""I N U _ _""
      Then we need to place T in 5 (since T cannot be in 4) and a new letter in 4.
      So ""I N U X T""
      What is X? Available letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.
      Example: ""I N U P T"" -> ""INPUT"" again! 
        But in ""INPUT"", we have I in 1, N in 2, U in 4? Wait, no: ""INPUT"" is I, N, P, U, T -> so positions: I(1), N(2), P(3), U(4), T(5). 
        But here we are putting U in 3? So it's different: we are trying ""I N U X T"", which would be position 3: U, but in ""INPUT"" position 3 is P.

      So we are considering a different word: ""INUKT"" not a word, ""INULT"" not a word, ""INUST"" S absent.

      But note: we are putting U in position 3, which is allowed? We haven't tested U in 3.

      But we need a word: ""INUPT"" -> not a word? ""INPUT"" has P in 3 and U in 4.

      How about ""INUST"" -> S absent.

      Not working.

    If we put T in 1: ""T N U _ _""
      Then we need to place I in 4 or 5 and a new letter in the other? Or if we put I in 4, then we need a letter for 5, but T is in 1, U in 3, so we have positions 4 and 5 for I and a new letter? But I can be in 4 or 5.

      If I in 4: ""T N U I _"", then we need a letter for 5. ""TNU I ?"" -> ""TNUI?"" -> ""TNUIS"" S absent, ""TNUIT"" -> ""TNUIT"" not a word.

      If I in 5: ""T N U _ I"", then we need a letter for 4. ""TNU?I"" -> ""TNULI"" not a word.

    If we put a new letter in 1: ""X N U _ _""
      Then we need to place I and T in 4 and 5? But T cannot be in 4, so T must be in 5? Then I in 4? 
      So ""X N U I T""
      But I in 4: we haven't tested I in 4, so it's allowed? And T in 5, allowed.
      What is X? 
        ""D N U I T"" -> ""DNUIT"" not a word.
        ""G N U I T"" -> ""GNUIT"" not a word.
        ""L N U I T"" -> ""LNUIT"" not a word.
        ""P N U I T"" -> ""PNUIT"" not a word.

      Not working.

- Put U in position 4: 
  _ N _ U _
  Then we need to place I and T in 1,3,5? But we have three positions and two letters? So one new letter.

  Constraints:
    Position 1: cannot be U, so I or T or new.
    Position 3: can be I? But I cannot be in 3? So I cannot be in 3. Therefore, position 3 must be T or new? But T can be in 3.
    Position 5: can be I or T? But T cannot be in 4 (already used) but 5 is fine.

  Also, U is in 4, which is allowed? We haven't tested U in 4.

  Example:
    If we put I in 1: ""I N _ U _""
      Then we need to place T in 3 or 5 and a new letter in the other? 
      If T in 3: ""I N T U _"", then we need a letter for 5. ""INTU?"" -> ""INTUP"" -> ""INTUP"" not a word, ""INTUS"" S absent.
      If T in 5: ""I N _ U T"", then we need a letter for 3. ""IN?UT"" -> ""INPUT"" -> which is I(1), N(2), P(3), U(4), T(5). This is the word ""INPUT"".

    If we put T in 1: ""T N _ U _""
      Then we need to place I in 5 (since I cannot be in 3) and a new letter in 3.
      So ""T N X U I""
      Example: ""T N D U I"" -> ""TNDUI"" not a word.

    If we put a new letter in 1: ""X N _ U _""
      Then we need to place I and T in 3 and 5? But I cannot be in 3, so I must be in 5? Then T must be in 3? 
      So ""X N T U I""
      Example: ""D N T U I"" -> ""DNTUI"" not a word.

- Put U in position 5: 
  _ N _ _ U
  Then we need to place I and T in 1,3,4? But we have three positions and two letters? So one new letter.

  Constraints:
    Position 1: cannot be U, so I or T or new.
    Position 3: can be T? But I cannot be in 3, so if we put I in 3, not allowed. So position 3 must be T or new.
    Position 4: can be I? But T cannot be in 4.

  Example:
    If we put I in 1: ""I N _ _ U""
      Then we need to place T in 3 (since T cannot be in 4) and a new letter in 4? Or T in 3 and new in 4? 
      ""I N T ? U"" -> ""INT?U"" -> ""INTXU"" not a word.
      Or if we put T in 3 and then a letter in 4: ""I N T X U"", which is ""INTXU"" not a word.

    If we put T in 1: ""T N _ _ U""
      Then we need to place I in 4 (since I cannot be in 3) and a new letter in 3? But position 3 must be filled. 
      ""T N X I U"" -> ""T N X I U"", and I is in 4, which is allowed? We haven't tested I in 4.
      Example: ""T N D I U"" -> ""TNDIU"" not a word.

    If we put a new letter in 1: ""X N _ _ U""
      Then we need to place I and T in 3 and 4? But I cannot be in 3, and T cannot be in 4. So we cannot put I in 3 or T in 4. 
      Therefore, we must put T in 3 and I in 4? 
      So ""X N T I U""
      Example: ""D N T I U"" -> ""DNTIU"" not a word.

After exploring, the only common word that fits is ""INPUT"". 

Let me double-check if ""INPUT"" satisfies all the feedback:

- Secret word: ? ? ? ? ? 
- We are guessing: I N P U T

Feedback from previous guesses:

1. ""crane"": 
   C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x) -> N is present but not in position 4. In ""INPUT"", N is in position 2, so that matches. The other letters (C,R,A,E) are absent, and ""INPUT"" doesn't have them.

2. ""bison"":
   B(x), I(-), S(x), O(x), N(-) -> I is present but not in position 2, and N is present but not in position 5. In ""INPUT"", I is in position 1 (not 2) and N is in position 2 (not 5), so that matches.

3. ""unity"":
   U(-), N(✓), I(-), T(-), Y(x) -> 
   - U is present but not in position 1: in ""INPUT"", U is in position 4, so not 1 -> matches.
   - N is correct in position 2: matches.
   - I is present but not in position 3: in ""INPUT"", I is in position 1, not 3 -> matches.
   - T is present but not in position 4: in ""INPUT"", T is in position 5, not 4 -> matches.
   - Y is absent: ""INPUT"" has no Y -> matches.

Also, the word ""INPUT"" is a valid 5-letter word.

Therefore, we can guess ""INPUT"".

But note: we have already used ""bison"" and ""unity"", but not ""input"". So it's a new guess.

So the next guess is ""INPUT"".

<guess>input</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **N is confirmed in position 2** (from ""unity"" feedback: N✓).
- **U, I, T are present** but in wrong positions (U-, I-, T- in ""unity"").
- **Y is absent** (Yx in ""unity"").
- **Absent letters**: A, B, C, E, O, R, S, Y (from all feedback).
- **Position constraints**:
  - U cannot be in position 1 (from ""unity"").
  - I cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from ""bison"" and ""unity"").
  - T cannot be in position 4 (from ""unity"").

The secret word structure is: `_ N _ _ _`  
and must include U, I, T in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (with constraints).

After evaluating possible words that fit these constraints and include only unused letters (D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z), **""INPUT""** is the optimal guess because:
- **I** is in position 1 (new position, allowed).
- **N** is in position 2 (confirmed).
- **P** is a new letter (not tested).
- **U** is in position 4 (new position, allowed since U≠1).
- **T** is in position 5 (new position, allowed since T≠4).

This guess tests all remaining letters (U, I, T) in new positions while introducing P, maximizing information for the next move.",Guess 4: input -> FEEDBACK: I(✓) N(✓) P(✓) U(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
