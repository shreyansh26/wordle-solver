We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has three vowels and two common consonants. The word ""ROATE"" is sometimes used, but let me pick a more common one.
 Alternatively, ""CRANE"" is a popular choice because it has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' — which are common letters.

 However, note that the game requires a valid 5-letter English word.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess.

We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x -> not in the word
 R: x -> not in the word
 A: - -> in the word but wrong position
 N: x -> not in the word
 E: x -> not in the word

 So, we know:
 - The letter A is present in the secret word, but not in the second position (since in ""crane"" it was the third letter).
 - The letters C, R, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, but not in the third position. Also, it does not contain C, R, N, or E.

 Since we have only one letter confirmed (A), and it's in the wrong position, we need to choose a new word that:
 1. Contains the letter A in a different position (not the third).
 2. Avoids the letters C, R, N, E.

 Also, we want to use this guess to test other common letters to get more information.

 Let's think about other common letters. After vowels, common consonants include T, S, L, etc.

 We know the secret word has 5 letters and must contain A somewhere.

 Possible positions for A: It could be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since it can't be in 3).

 We should choose a word that:
 - Has an A in either position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
 - Does not contain C, R, N, E.
 - Includes other common letters we haven't tested yet, such as T, S, L, P, M, etc.

 Example words:
 - ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E -> but E is not allowed (we know E is out), so avoid E.
 - ""PLAIT"" has P, L, A, I, T -> but it's 5 letters and doesn't use C,R,N,E? Let's check: P, L, A, I, T -> all allowed? Yes.

 However, we don't know about I and T yet.

 Another idea: ""TASTY"" has two T's and A and S, but repeats T. We might not want to repeat letters to maximize information.

 Alternatively, ""SALAD"" has two A's? But we don't know if there are duplicate letters. It might be better to avoid duplicates unless we suspect them.

 Considering we have only 6 tries, we should aim to cover new letters.

 Let's choose a word that includes A and other vowels (we know E is out, so we can try I and O) and some consonants.

 We know E is out but other vowels: O, U, I are possible.

 Example: ""PAINT"" -> but N is out (from our feedback: N is x). So we cannot use N.

 Another: ""MAILS"" -> M, A, I, L, S -> no C,R,N,E. And positions: A is in the second position? In ""MAILS"", A is the third letter? We need to put A in a position that is not 3.

 We must avoid putting A in the third position because we already know it's not there.

 In ""MAILS"": M-A-I-L-S -> A is the second letter? Actually:
 Position 1: M
 Position 2: A
 Position 3: I
 Position 4: L
 Position 5: S

 So A is at position 2? That's acceptable.

 But wait: the feedback said A was in the word but not in the third position. It doesn't say it can't be in the third again? Actually, no: we know the secret word has exactly one A? Not necessarily, but let's proceed.

 Alternatively, we can try ""PLAIT"":
 Position 1: P
 Position 2: L
 Position 3: A  -> but wait, we know A is not in the third position? 
 However, the feedback only said that in the word ""crane"", the A in the third position was wrong. The secret word might have A in the third position again? Actually, no, because that A was at the same position? We are told that the letter is in the word but in the wrong position. Therefore, if we put A in the third position again, it might be the same mistake? Actually, if the secret word has A in the third position, then in our first guess we would have had a ✓ for A, but we had a '-' meaning it is in the word but not in the third position. Therefore, the secret word does not have A in the third position. So we should avoid putting A in the third position again.

 Therefore, in ""PLAIT"", A is in the third position -> same as before -> we know that the secret word doesn't have A in the third, so it would be inefficient to put it there again.

 So we must pick a word that has A in either position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Let's try to find a word that has A in position 1: 
 Example: ""ADIEU"" -> but this has E (which is out) and D, I, U.

 Or ""AUDIO"" -> A in first, and U, D, I, O.

 But we avoid E? Yes, but E is out, so we can use U, D, I, O.

 However, we also want to test more consonants. We haven't tested T, S, L, etc.

 Another word: ""LASTS""? No, duplicate S.

 Alternatively: ""TALON"" -> T, A, L, O, N -> but N is out? Yes, N is not allowed.

 Since N is out, we cannot use words with N.

 With that in mind: let's avoid N, E, C, R.

 Another word: ""PATIO"" -> P, A, T, I, O 
 Positions:
  1: P
  2: A (which is a new position -> we are testing A in second position? But we know A is somewhere, so putting it in second is acceptable)

 However, note that in ""crane"", A was in position 3 and we were told it's not there. Now in second? It might be the correct position.

 Alternatively: ""MANIA"" -> M, A, N, I, A -> N is out? Yes, so invalid.

 How about ""SOLAR"" -> S, O, L, A, R -> R is out? Yes, we cannot use R.

 So we must avoid R? Yes.

 So prohibited letters: C, R, N, E.

 We are allowed: A (which we must include) and any other letters except these.

 Common letters left: T, S, L, O, P, M, I, U, etc.

 Let me try to form a word that has A and four new common letters.

 Word: ""PASTY"" -> P, A, S, T, Y -> positions: 
  1: P
  2: A -> but that's position 2? We don't know if position 2 is correct for A? We are trying to see if it can be at position 2.

 Alternatively, put A in position 4: 
 Word: ""OPALS"" -> O, P, A, L, S -> but the word is OPALS? Or ""PALSY""? 

 Actually, ""PALSY"" is a word: P, A, L, S, Y -> then A is at position 2 again? 

 How about ""TOPAZ"": T, O, P, A, Z -> A is at position 4 -> great! 
 But let me check if that is a valid English word: topaz is a gemstone -> valid.

 But note: we haven't tested S and L? But we can test others.

 Alternatively, ""PLASM"" -> not a word? 

 Another one: ""QUASH"" -> Q, U, A, S, H -> A is at position 3? We cannot put A at position 3. In ""QUASH"", the A is at the fourth letter? 
 Q-U-A-S-H -> positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:A, 4:S, 5:H -> oh, it's at 3? Avoided.

 How about ""DAISY""? D, A, I, S, Y -> A at position 2? But we don't know D? 

 We haven't tested D? So it's okay.

 But note: we are avoiding E, C, R, N -> so D is allowed.

 However, we want to maximize the number of new letters. Also, note that we have only tested a few letters: C,R,A,N,E. So we have many letters left.

 I think ""DAISY"" is okay? But in the word, A is at position 2. We don't know about D, I, S, Y.

 Alternatively, let's use a word with A at the beginning? ""ANGRY"" -> N and R are out -> no.

 Another word: ""PATIO"" -> P, A, T, I, O -> which we mentioned earlier: A is at position 2? 
 Positions: 
  1: P
  2: A (this avoids position 3)
  3: T
  4: I
  5: O

 No duplicate letters. And none of the forbidden letters.

 This word tests: P, A (in position 2), T, I, O.

 We haven't tested P, T, I, O yet? And A we know is present, but we are also testing if position 2 is correct.

 Therefore, ""PATIO"" seems like a good candidate.

 But note: the feedback from the first guess told us that A was in the word but not in position 3. Now we are putting it in position 2. If the secret word has A in position 2, then we'll get a ✓ for that A. Otherwise, if A is in another position, we'll get '-'.

 So let's go with ""PATIO"".

<guess>patio</guess>
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:
- The secret word contains 'A', but not in the third position.
- The letters C, R, N, and E are not in the word.

For this guess, I chose ""patio"" because:
- It includes the confirmed letter 'A' in a new position (second slot) to test if it belongs there.
- It introduces new common letters (P, T, I, O) that haven't been tested yet.
- It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, N, E) and positions (third slot for 'A').

This guess maximizes information gain about the secret word's composition.

 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has three vowels and two common consonants. The word ""ROATE"" is sometimes used, but let me pick a more common one.
 Alternatively, ""CRANE"" is a popular choice because it has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' — which are common letters.

 However, note that the game requires a valid 5-letter English word.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess.

 So, my first guess is: CRANE

 Since we have only one letter confirmed (A), and it's in the wrong position, we need to choose a new word that:
 1. Contains the letter A in a different position (not the third).
 2. Avoids the letters C, R, N, E.

 Also, we want to use this guess to test other common letters to get more information.

 Let's think about other common letters. After vowels, common consonants include T, S, L, etc.

 We know the secret word has 5 letters and must contain A somewhere.

 Possible positions for A: It could be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since it can't be in 3).

 We should choose a word that:
 - Has an A in either position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
 - Does not contain C, R, N, E.
 - Includes other common letters we haven't tested yet, such as T, S, L, P, M, etc.

 Example words:
 - ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E -> but E is not allowed (we know E is out), so avoid E.
 - ""PLAIT"" has P, L, A, I, T -> but it's 5 letters and doesn't use C,R,N,E? Let's check: P, L, A, I, T -> all allowed? Yes.

 However, we don't know about I and T yet.

 Another idea: ""TASTY"" has two T's and A and S, but repeats T. We might not want to repeat letters to maximize information.

 Alternatively, ""SALAD"" has two A's? But we don't know if there are duplicate letters. It might be better to avoid duplicates unless we suspect them.

 Considering we have only 6 tries, we should aim to cover new letters.

 Let's choose a word that includes A and other vowels (we know E is out, so we can try I and O) and some consonants.

 We know E is out but other vowels: O, U, I are possible.

 Example: ""PAINT"" -> but N is out (from our feedback: N is x). So we cannot use N.

 Another: ""MAILS"" -> M, A, I, L, S -> no C,R,N,E. And positions: A is in the second position? In ""MAILS"", A is the third letter? We need to put A in a position that is not 3.

 We must avoid putting A in the third position because we already know it's not there.

 In ""MAILS"": M-A-I-L-S -> A is the second letter? Actually:
 Position 1: M
 Position 2: A
 Position 3: I
 Position 4: L
 Position 5: S

 So A is at position 2? That's acceptable.

 But wait: the feedback said A was in the word but not in the third position. It doesn't say it can't be in the third again? Actually, no: we know the secret word has exactly one A? Not necessarily, but let's proceed.

 Alternatively, we can try ""PLAIT"":
 Position 1: P
 Position 2: L
 Position 3: A  -> but wait, we know A is not in the third position? 
 However, the feedback only said that in the word ""crane"", the A in the third position was wrong. The secret word might have A in the third position again? Actually, no, because that A was at the same position? We are told that the letter is in the word but in the wrong position. Therefore, if we put A in the third position again, it might be the same mistake? Actually, if the secret word has A in the third position, then in our first guess we would have had a ✓ for A, but we had a '-' meaning it is in the word but not in the third position. Therefore, the secret word does not have A in the third position. So we should avoid putting A in the third position again.

 Therefore, in ""PLAIT"", A is in the third position -> same as before -> we know that the secret word doesn't have A in the third, so it would be inefficient to put it there again.

 So we must pick a word that has A in either position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Let's try to find a word that has A in position 1: 
 Example: ""ADIEU"" -> but this has E (which is out) and D, I, U.

 Or ""AUDIO"" -> A in first, and U, D, I, O.

 But we avoid E? Yes, but E is out, so we can use U, D, I, O.

 However, we also want to test more consonants. We haven't tested T, S, L, etc.

 Another word: ""LASTS""? No, duplicate S.

 Alternatively: ""TALON"" -> T, A, L, O, N -> but N is out? Yes, N is not allowed.

 Since N is out, we cannot use words with N.

 With that in mind: let's avoid N, E, C, R.

 Another word: ""PATIO"" -> P, A, T, I, O 
 Positions:
  1: P
  2: A (which is a new position -> we are testing A in second position? But we know A is somewhere, so putting it in second is acceptable)

 However, note that in ""crane"", A was in position 3 and we were told it's not there. Now in second? It might be the correct position.

 Alternatively: ""MANIA"" -> M, A, N, I, A -> N is out? Yes, so invalid.

 How about ""SOLAR"" -> S, O, L, A, R -> R is out? Yes, we cannot use R.

 So we must avoid R? Yes.

 So prohibited letters: C, R, N, E.

 We are allowed: A (which we must include) and any other letters except these.

 Common letters left: T, S, L, O, P, M, I, U, etc.

 Let me try to form a word that has A and four new common letters.

 Word: ""PASTY"" -> P, A, S, T, Y -> positions: 
  1: P
  2: A -> but that's position 2? We don't know if position 2 is correct for A? We are trying to see if it can be at position 2.

 Alternatively, put A in position 4: 
 Word: ""OPALS"" -> O, P, A, L, S -> but the word is OPALS? Or ""PALSY""? 

 Actually, ""PALSY"" is a word: P, A, L, S, Y -> then A is at position 2 again? 

 How about ""TOPAZ"": T, O, P, A, Z -> A is at position 4 -> great! 
 But let me check if that is a valid English word: topaz is a gemstone -> valid.

 But note: we haven't tested S and L? But we can test others.

 Alternatively, ""PLASM"" -> not a word? 

 Another one: ""QUASH"" -> Q, U, A, S, H -> A is at position 3? We cannot put A at position 3. In ""QUASH"", the A is at the fourth letter? 
 Q-U-A-S-H -> positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:A, 4:S, 5:H -> oh, it's at 3? Avoided.

 How about ""DAISY""? D, A, I, S, Y -> A at position 2? But we don't know D? 

 We haven't tested D? So it's okay.

 But note: we are avoiding E, C, R, N -> so D is allowed.

 However, we want to maximize the number of new letters. Also, note that we have only tested a few letters: C,R,A,N,E. So we have many letters left.

 I think ""DAISY"" is okay? But in the word, A is at position 2. We don't know about D, I, S, Y.

 Alternatively, let's use a word with A at the beginning? ""ANGRY"" -> N and R are out -> no.

 Another word: ""PATIO"" -> P, A, T, I, O -> which we mentioned earlier: A is at position 2? 
 Positions: 
  1: P
  2: A (this avoids position 3)
  3: T
  4: I
  5: O

 No duplicate letters. And none of the forbidden letters.

 This word tests: P, A (in position 2), T, I, O.

 We haven't tested P, T, I, O yet? And A we know is present, but we are also testing if position 2 is correct.

 Therefore, ""PATIO"" seems like a good candidate.

 But note: the feedback from the first guess told us that A was in the word but not in position 3. Now we are putting it in position 2. If the secret word has A in position 2, then we'll get a ✓ for that A. Otherwise, if A is in another position, we'll get '-'.

 So let's go with ""PATIO"".

<guess>patio</guess>Based on the previous feedback:
- The secret word contains 'A', but not in the third position.
- The letters C, R, N, and E are not in the word.

For this guess, I chose ""patio"" because:
- It includes the confirmed letter 'A' in a new position (second slot) to test if it belongs there.
- It introduces new common letters (P, T, I, O) that haven't been tested yet.
- It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, N, E) and positions (third slot for 'A').

This guess maximizes information gain about the secret word's composition.

We are given feedback on the second guess ""patio"":
 P: x -> not in the word
 A: ✓ -> in the word and in the CORRECT position (so the second letter of the secret word is A)
 T: - -> in the word but in the wrong position
 I: x -> not in the word
 O: x -> not in the word

 Now we know:
 - The second letter of the secret word is A. So the word has the form _ A _ _ _
 - The letter T is in the word, but not in the third position (because in ""patio"", T was in the third position and we got a '-' meaning it's present but not there).
 - The letters P, I, O are not in the word. Also, from the first guess, we know C, R, N, E are not in the word.

 So, total letters that are out: C, R, N, E, P, I, O.

 We also know that T is present, but not in the third position. Since the second position is A, T must be in one of the positions: 1, 4, or 5.

 The secret word pattern: _ A _ _ _

 We have to choose a word that:
   - Has the second letter as A (so we keep the known correct letter).
   - Includes the letter T in either position 1, 4, or 5 (to find its correct position).
   - Avoids the letters: C, R, N, E, P, I, O.

 We also want to test other common letters that we haven't tried yet. The remaining common letters include: S, L, D, U, M, B, G, Y, etc.

 Since we know the second letter is A, we can fix that and vary the others.

 Let's try to form a word that fits: _ A _ _ _

 We need to put T in position 1, 4, or 5.

 Option 1: T in position 1 -> T A _ _ _
 Option 2: T in position 4 -> _ A _ T _
 Option 3: T in position 5 -> _ A _ _ T

 We also need to fill the other positions with new letters (not in the excluded set).

 Let's think of words that fit:

 Option 1: T A _ _ _
   Possible words: TABBY, TABLA, TABLE, TABOO, ... but we have constraints:
   - Avoid E (so TABLE is out), avoid O (TABOO is out), avoid I, etc.

   TABBY: T, A, B, B, Y -> has duplicate B? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? We can use it? But we want to test new letters. Also, B and Y are new.

   However, we don't know if B is in the word? We can test.

   But note: we also have the letter T to place, and we are putting it at position 1. We know T is present, so if we put it at position 1 and it's correct, we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' meaning it's in the word but not at position 1? But wait, we know T is present, so if it's not at position 1, then it must be at 4 or 5.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has T in a position we are unsure about (like 4 or 5) to test.

   Since we have limited guesses, we should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

   How about ""TALKS""? But S is new, L is new, but K is also new? 
   However, in ""TALKS"": T at 1, A at 2 (correct), L at 3, K at 4, S at 5.
   But we are avoiding? We are avoiding C,R,N,E,P,I,O. So L, K, S are allowed.

   But note: we know T is present, and we are putting it at position 1. If the secret word has T at position 1, then we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' and then we know T must be at 4 or 5.

   However, we also have the feedback from the T in the previous guess: in ""patio"", T was at position 3 and we got a '-'. So T is not at position 3. But we are now trying position 1? That's fine.

   But wait: what if the secret word has two T's? We don't know. So we can try.

   However, ""TALKS"" has T at 1 and then no other T. So if the secret word has only one T, then if we get a ✓ for T at 1, then we know it's correct. If we get a '-', then we know T is at 4 or 5.

   But we also have to consider that the secret word might have two T's? It's possible, but we don't have evidence. We'll assume one for now.

   Alternatively, we can avoid putting T in the first position and instead put it in a position we haven't tried (like 4 or 5) to see if it belongs there.

   We have tried T in position 3 (in ""patio"") and got a '-'. We haven't tried position 1, 4, or 5.

   To maximize information, we might want to test T in a new position that we haven't tried, and also test other letters.

   Let me think of words with T in position 4: _ A _ T _
     Example: ""GASTS"" -> duplicate S? 
     Or ""BASTS"" -> duplicate S? 
     How about ""DAWTS""? D, A, W, T, S -> but we don't know D, W, S.

   Or with T in position 5: _ A _ _ T
     Example: ""FEAST"" -> but E is out. 
     ""BLAST"" -> but L, S, T: but we don't know if L and S are in? But B is new. However, we have to avoid E? ""BLAST"" has no E? B, L, A, S, T -> but A is at position 3? We need A at position 2. So we cannot use ""BLAST"" because the A is at position 3? Actually, in ""BLAST"": 
        Position 1: B
        Position 2: L -> not A? But we need the second letter to be A. So we must have the pattern: _ A _ _ T

     So the word must have the second letter A and the last letter T? 
        Example: ""HAVAT""? Not a word.
        ""BEAUT"" -> not a word? 
        ""DAVIT"" -> D, A, V, I, T -> but I is out? We cannot use I.

     Since I is out, we cannot use words with I.

     Another: ""YEAST"" -> E is out.

     How about ""MAKUT""? Not a word.

     This is difficult. Let me think of common words: 
        ""EXACT"" -> E and C are out.

     Maybe we should avoid position 5 for now.

   Alternatively, we can try T in position 4: _ A _ T _
     Words: ""FASTS"" -> duplicate S? 
            ""GAMUT"" -> G, A, M, U, T -> but then the T is at position 5? 
            We need T at position 4: so the word must be _ A _ T _
            Example: ""BAITH"" -> not common? 
            ""WAIFT"" -> not a word.

     How about ""HASTY"": H, A, S, T, Y -> 
        Position 1: H
        Position 2: A (correct)
        Position 3: S
        Position 4: T
        Position 5: Y

     This fits: _ A _ T _ -> H A S T Y

     And it uses H, S, T, Y. We know T is present, and we are testing it at position 4. Also, H, S, Y are new.

     The word ""HASTY"" is valid.

     But note: we are avoiding? H, S, T, Y are not in the excluded list (excluded: C,R,N,E,P,I,O). So it's okay.

     Also, we are testing S at position 3 and Y at position 5.

   Another option: ""PASTA"" -> but P is out? We cannot use P.

   So ""HASTY"" seems good.

   But wait, we also have the feedback that T is not in position 3. In ""HASTY"", we are putting T at position 4. That's a new position, so we can test.

   Alternatively, we can try T in position 1: ""TABBY"", ""TACKY"" (but C is out), ""TALKY"" (K and Y), ""TANSY"" (N is out), ""TAPAS"" (P is out). So ""TALKY"" is possible? T, A, L, K, Y -> but we don't know L, K, Y.

   However, we already have a candidate: ""HASTY"".

   Let me compare:
     ""TALKY"": tests T at position 1, A at 2 (correct), L at 3, K at 4, Y at 5.
     ""HASTY"": tests H at 1, A at 2 (correct), S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5.

   Both are valid. But note that in ""TALKY"", we are testing T at position 1. We know T is in the word, so if we put it at position 1 and it's correct, we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' meaning T is in the word but not at 1 (so it must be at 4 or 5). 

   Similarly, in ""HASTY"", we are testing T at position 4. If it's correct, we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' meaning T is in the word but not at 4 (so it must be at 1 or 5).

   We also get information about the other letters.

   Since we have only 4 guesses left (after this one), we want to maximize the chance of getting more information.

   The word ""HASTY"" has the advantage that it tests two common letters: S and H, and also Y.

   But note: we already know that the third position is not T (from the previous feedback). So in ""HASTY"", we are testing S at the third position. That might be useful.

   I think ""HASTY"" is a good choice.

   However, let me check if there is a word that tests more vowels? We haven't tested U? But we don't have any indication of vowels other than A. We know E and I and O are out? From the feedback, we have excluded E, I, O. So the only vowel left is U? And sometimes Y.

   We might consider including U? But we don't have to.

   I'll go with ""HASTY"".

   So the guess is: HASTY

   But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""HASTY"" is a valid English word.

   Therefore, we guess ""HASTY"".

</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: A is in the word but not in position 3. C, R, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (PATIO)**: A is correct and in position 2. T is in the word but not in position 3. P, I, O are absent.

### Key Insights:
1. **Fixed Position**: The second letter is **A** (so the word pattern is `_ A _ _ _`).
2. **Confirmed Present**: **T** is in the word, but not in position 3 (so it must be in position 1, 4, or 5).
3. **Absent Letters**: C, R, N, E, P, I, O (cannot be used).
4. **Goal**: Test new common letters (e.g., S, L, H, Y) and verify T's position.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Use a word that:
  - Keeps **A** in position 2.
  - Places **T** in an untested position (position 4) to check if it belongs there.
  - Tests new high-frequency letters (H, S, Y) in unused positions.
  - Avoids all excluded letters.

**Chosen word: HASTY**  
- **H** (position 1): Tests a new consonant.  
- **A** (position 2): Confirmed correct (✓).  
- **S** (position 3): Tests a common letter in an open slot.  
- **T** (position 4): Tests T in a new position (previously tried in position 3).  
- **Y** (position 5): Tests a less common letter.  

This guess efficiently narrows down possibilities for T while maximizing new letter coverage.

<guess>hasty</guess>",hasty,"We are given feedback on the second guess ""patio"":
 P: x -> not in the word
 A: ✓ -> in the word and in the CORRECT position (so the second letter of the secret word is A)
 T: - -> in the word but in the wrong position
 I: x -> not in the word
 O: x -> not in the word

 Now we know:
 - The second letter of the secret word is A. So the word has the form _ A _ _ _
 - The letter T is in the word, but not in the third position (because in ""patio"", T was in the third position and we got a '-' meaning it's present but not there).
 - The letters P, I, O are not in the word. Also, from the first guess, we know C, R, N, E are not in the word.

 So, total letters that are out: C, R, N, E, P, I, O.

 We also know that T is present, but not in the third position. Since the second position is A, T must be in one of the positions: 1, 4, or 5.

 The secret word pattern: _ A _ _ _

 We have to choose a word that:
   - Has the second letter as A (so we keep the known correct letter).
   - Includes the letter T in either position 1, 4, or 5 (to find its correct position).
   - Avoids the letters: C, R, N, E, P, I, O.

 We also want to test other common letters that we haven't tried yet. The remaining common letters include: S, L, D, U, M, B, G, Y, etc.

 Since we know the second letter is A, we can fix that and vary the others.

 Let's try to form a word that fits: _ A _ _ _

 We need to put T in position 1, 4, or 5.

 Option 1: T in position 1 -> T A _ _ _
 Option 2: T in position 4 -> _ A _ T _
 Option 3: T in position 5 -> _ A _ _ T

 We also need to fill the other positions with new letters (not in the excluded set).

 Let's think of words that fit:

 Option 1: T A _ _ _
   Possible words: TABBY, TABLA, TABLE, TABOO, ... but we have constraints:
   - Avoid E (so TABLE is out), avoid O (TABOO is out), avoid I, etc.

   TABBY: T, A, B, B, Y -> has duplicate B? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? We can use it? But we want to test new letters. Also, B and Y are new.

   However, we don't know if B is in the word? We can test.

   But note: we also have the letter T to place, and we are putting it at position 1. We know T is present, so if we put it at position 1 and it's correct, we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' meaning it's in the word but not at position 1? But wait, we know T is present, so if it's not at position 1, then it must be at 4 or 5.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has T in a position we are unsure about (like 4 or 5) to test.

   Since we have limited guesses, we should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

   How about ""TALKS""? But S is new, L is new, but K is also new? 
   However, in ""TALKS"": T at 1, A at 2 (correct), L at 3, K at 4, S at 5.
   But we are avoiding? We are avoiding C,R,N,E,P,I,O. So L, K, S are allowed.

   But note: we know T is present, and we are putting it at position 1. If the secret word has T at position 1, then we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' and then we know T must be at 4 or 5.

   However, we also have the feedback from the T in the previous guess: in ""patio"", T was at position 3 and we got a '-'. So T is not at position 3. But we are now trying position 1? That's fine.

   But wait: what if the secret word has two T's? We don't know. So we can try.

   However, ""TALKS"" has T at 1 and then no other T. So if the secret word has only one T, then if we get a ✓ for T at 1, then we know it's correct. If we get a '-', then we know T is at 4 or 5.

   But we also have to consider that the secret word might have two T's? It's possible, but we don't have evidence. We'll assume one for now.

   Alternatively, we can avoid putting T in the first position and instead put it in a position we haven't tried (like 4 or 5) to see if it belongs there.

   We have tried T in position 3 (in ""patio"") and got a '-'. We haven't tried position 1, 4, or 5.

   To maximize information, we might want to test T in a new position that we haven't tried, and also test other letters.

   Let me think of words with T in position 4: _ A _ T _
     Example: ""GASTS"" -> duplicate S? 
     Or ""BASTS"" -> duplicate S? 
     How about ""DAWTS""? D, A, W, T, S -> but we don't know D, W, S.

   Or with T in position 5: _ A _ _ T
     Example: ""FEAST"" -> but E is out. 
     ""BLAST"" -> but L, S, T: but we don't know if L and S are in? But B is new. However, we have to avoid E? ""BLAST"" has no E? B, L, A, S, T -> but A is at position 3? We need A at position 2. So we cannot use ""BLAST"" because the A is at position 3? Actually, in ""BLAST"": 
        Position 1: B
        Position 2: L -> not A? But we need the second letter to be A. So we must have the pattern: _ A _ _ T

     So the word must have the second letter A and the last letter T? 
        Example: ""HAVAT""? Not a word.
        ""BEAUT"" -> not a word? 
        ""DAVIT"" -> D, A, V, I, T -> but I is out? We cannot use I.

     Since I is out, we cannot use words with I.

     Another: ""YEAST"" -> E is out.

     How about ""MAKUT""? Not a word.

     This is difficult. Let me think of common words: 
        ""EXACT"" -> E and C are out.

     Maybe we should avoid position 5 for now.

   Alternatively, we can try T in position 4: _ A _ T _
     Words: ""FASTS"" -> duplicate S? 
            ""GAMUT"" -> G, A, M, U, T -> but then the T is at position 5? 
            We need T at position 4: so the word must be _ A _ T _
            Example: ""BAITH"" -> not common? 
            ""WAIFT"" -> not a word.

     How about ""HASTY"": H, A, S, T, Y -> 
        Position 1: H
        Position 2: A (correct)
        Position 3: S
        Position 4: T
        Position 5: Y

     This fits: _ A _ T _ -> H A S T Y

     And it uses H, S, T, Y. We know T is present, and we are testing it at position 4. Also, H, S, Y are new.

     The word ""HASTY"" is valid.

     But note: we are avoiding? H, S, T, Y are not in the excluded list (excluded: C,R,N,E,P,I,O). So it's okay.

     Also, we are testing S at position 3 and Y at position 5.

   Another option: ""PASTA"" -> but P is out? We cannot use P.

   So ""HASTY"" seems good.

   But wait, we also have the feedback that T is not in position 3. In ""HASTY"", we are putting T at position 4. That's a new position, so we can test.

   Alternatively, we can try T in position 1: ""TABBY"", ""TACKY"" (but C is out), ""TALKY"" (K and Y), ""TANSY"" (N is out), ""TAPAS"" (P is out). So ""TALKY"" is possible? T, A, L, K, Y -> but we don't know L, K, Y.

   However, we already have a candidate: ""HASTY"".

   Let me compare:
     ""TALKY"": tests T at position 1, A at 2 (correct), L at 3, K at 4, Y at 5.
     ""HASTY"": tests H at 1, A at 2 (correct), S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5.

   Both are valid. But note that in ""TALKY"", we are testing T at position 1. We know T is in the word, so if we put it at position 1 and it's correct, we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' meaning T is in the word but not at 1 (so it must be at 4 or 5). 

   Similarly, in ""HASTY"", we are testing T at position 4. If it's correct, we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' meaning T is in the word but not at 4 (so it must be at 1 or 5).

   We also get information about the other letters.

   Since we have only 4 guesses left (after this one), we want to maximize the chance of getting more information.

   The word ""HASTY"" has the advantage that it tests two common letters: S and H, and also Y.

   But note: we already know that the third position is not T (from the previous feedback). So in ""HASTY"", we are testing S at the third position. That might be useful.

   I think ""HASTY"" is a good choice.

   However, let me check if there is a word that tests more vowels? We haven't tested U? But we don't have any indication of vowels other than A. We know E and I and O are out? From the feedback, we have excluded E, I, O. So the only vowel left is U? And sometimes Y.

   We might consider including U? But we don't have to.

   I'll go with ""HASTY"".

   So the guess is: HASTY

   But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""HASTY"" is a valid English word.

   Therefore, we guess ""HASTY"".

<guess>hasty</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: A is in the word but not in position 3. C, R, N, E are absent.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has three vowels and two common consonants. The word ""ROATE"" is sometimes used, but let me pick a more common one.
 Alternatively, ""CRANE"" is a popular choice because it has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' — which are common letters.

 However, note that the game requires a valid 5-letter English word.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess.

 So, my first guess is: CRANE

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x -> not in the word
 R: x -> not in the word
 A: - -> in the word but wrong position
 N: x -> not in the word
 E: x -> not in the word

 So, we know:
 - The letter A is present in the secret word, but not in the second position (since in ""crane"" it was the third letter).
 - The letters C, R, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, but not in the third position. Also, it does not contain C, R, N, or E.

 Since we have only one letter confirmed (A), and it's in the wrong position, we need to choose a new word that:
 1. Contains the letter A in a different position (not the third).
 2. Avoids the letters C, R, N, E.

 Also, we want to use this guess to test other common letters to get more information.

 Let's think about other common letters. After vowels, common consonants include T, S, L, etc.

 We know the secret word has 5 letters and must contain A somewhere.

 Possible positions for A: It could be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since it can't be in 3).

 We should choose a word that:
 - Has an A in either position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
 - Does not contain C, R, N, E.
 - Includes other common letters we haven't tested yet, such as T, S, L, P, M, etc.

 Example words:
 - ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E -> but E is not allowed (we know E is out), so avoid E.
 - ""PLAIT"" has P, L, A, I, T -> but it's 5 letters and doesn't use C,R,N,E? Let's check: P, L, A, I, T -> all allowed? Yes.

 However, we don't know about I and T yet.

 Another idea: ""TASTY"" has two T's and A and S, but repeats T. We might not want to repeat letters to maximize information.

 Alternatively, ""SALAD"" has two A's? But we don't know if there are duplicate letters. It might be better to avoid duplicates unless we suspect them.

 Considering we have only 6 tries, we should aim to cover new letters.

 Let's choose a word that includes A and other vowels (we know E is out, so we can try I and O) and some consonants.

 We know E is out but other vowels: O, U, I are possible.

 Example: ""PAINT"" -> but N is out (from our feedback: N is x). So we cannot use N.

 Another: ""MAILS"" -> M, A, I, L, S -> no C,R,N,E. And positions: A is in the second position? In ""MAILS"", A is the third letter? We need to put A in a position that is not 3.

 We must avoid putting A in the third position because we already know it's not there.

 In ""MAILS"": M-A-I-L-S -> A is the second letter? Actually:
 Position 1: M
 Position 2: A
 Position 3: I
 Position 4: L
 Position 5: S

 So A is at position 2? That's acceptable.

 But wait: the feedback said A was in the word but not in the third position. It doesn't say it can't be in the third again? Actually, no: we know the secret word has exactly one A? Not necessarily, but let's proceed.

 Alternatively, we can try ""PLAIT"":
 Position 1: P
 Position 2: L
 Position 3: A  -> but wait, we know A is not in the third position? 
 However, the feedback only said that in the word ""crane"", the A in the third position was wrong. The secret word might have A in the third position again? Actually, no, because that A was at the same position? We are told that the letter is in the word but in the wrong position. Therefore, if we put A in the third position again, it might be the same mistake? Actually, if the secret word has A in the third position, then in our first guess we would have had a ✓ for A, but we had a '-' meaning it is in the word but not in the third position. Therefore, the secret word does not have A in the third position. So we should avoid putting A in the third position again.

 Therefore, in ""PLAIT"", A is in the third position -> same as before -> we know that the secret word doesn't have A in the third, so it would be inefficient to put it there again.

 So we must pick a word that has A in either position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Let's try to find a word that has A in position 1: 
 Example: ""ADIEU"" -> but this has E (which is out) and D, I, U.

 Or ""AUDIO"" -> A in first, and U, D, I, O.

 But we avoid E? Yes, but E is out, so we can use U, D, I, O.

 However, we also want to test more consonants. We haven't tested T, S, L, etc.

 Another word: ""LASTS""? No, duplicate S.

 Alternatively: ""TALON"" -> T, A, L, O, N -> but N is out? Yes, N is not allowed.

 Since N is out, we cannot use words with N.

 With that in mind: let's avoid N, E, C, R.

 Another word: ""PATIO"" -> P, A, T, I, O 
 Positions:
  1: P
  2: A (which is a new position -> we are testing A in second position? But we know A is somewhere, so putting it in second is acceptable)

 However, note that in ""crane"", A was in position 3 and we were told it's not there. Now in second? It might be the correct position.

 Alternatively: ""MANIA"" -> M, A, N, I, A -> N is out? Yes, so invalid.

 How about ""SOLAR"" -> S, O, L, A, R -> R is out? Yes, we cannot use R.

 So we must avoid R? Yes.

 So prohibited letters: C, R, N, E.

 We are allowed: A (which we must include) and any other letters except these.

 Common letters left: T, S, L, O, P, M, I, U, etc.

 Let me try to form a word that has A and four new common letters.

 Word: ""PASTY"" -> P, A, S, T, Y -> positions: 
  1: P
  2: A -> but that's position 2? We don't know if position 2 is correct for A? We are trying to see if it can be at position 2.

 Alternatively, put A in position 4: 
 Word: ""OPALS"" -> O, P, A, L, S -> but the word is OPALS? Or ""PALSY""? 

 Actually, ""PALSY"" is a word: P, A, L, S, Y -> then A is at position 2 again? 

 How about ""TOPAZ"": T, O, P, A, Z -> A is at position 4 -> great! 
 But let me check if that is a valid English word: topaz is a gemstone -> valid.

 But note: we haven't tested S and L? But we can test others.

 Alternatively, ""PLASM"" -> not a word? 

 Another one: ""QUASH"" -> Q, U, A, S, H -> A is at position 3? We cannot put A at position 3. In ""QUASH"", the A is at the fourth letter? 
 Q-U-A-S-H -> positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:A, 4:S, 5:H -> oh, it's at 3? Avoided.

 How about ""DAISY""? D, A, I, S, Y -> A at position 2? But we don't know D? 

 We haven't tested D? So it's okay.

 But note: we are avoiding E, C, R, N -> so D is allowed.

 However, we want to maximize the number of new letters. Also, note that we have only tested a few letters: C,R,A,N,E. So we have many letters left.

 I think ""DAISY"" is okay? But in the word, A is at position 2. We don't know about D, I, S, Y.

 Alternatively, let's use a word with A at the beginning? ""ANGRY"" -> N and R are out -> no.

 Another word: ""PATIO"" -> P, A, T, I, O -> which we mentioned earlier: A is at position 2? 
 Positions: 
  1: P
  2: A (this avoids position 3)
  3: T
  4: I
  5: O

 No duplicate letters. And none of the forbidden letters.

 This word tests: P, A (in position 2), T, I, O.

 We haven't tested P, T, I, O yet? And A we know is present, but we are also testing if position 2 is correct.

 Therefore, ""PATIO"" seems like a good candidate.

 But note: the feedback from the first guess told us that A was in the word but not in position 3. Now we are putting it in position 2. If the secret word has A in position 2, then we'll get a ✓ for that A. Otherwise, if A is in another position, we'll get '-'.

 So let's go with ""PATIO"".

<guess>patio</guess>Based on the previous feedback:
- The secret word contains 'A', but not in the third position.
- The letters C, R, N, and E are not in the word.

For this guess, I chose ""patio"" because:
- It includes the confirmed letter 'A' in a new position (second slot) to test if it belongs there.
- It introduces new common letters (P, T, I, O) that haven't been tested yet.
- It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, N, E) and positions (third slot for 'A').

This guess maximizes information gain about the secret word's composition.

 Now we know:
 - The second letter of the secret word is A. So the word has the form _ A _ _ _
 - The letter T is in the word, but not in the third position (because in ""patio"", T was in the third position and we got a '-' meaning it's present but not there).
 - The letters P, I, O are not in the word. Also, from the first guess, we know C, R, N, E are not in the word.

 So, total letters that are out: C, R, N, E, P, I, O.

 We also know that T is present, but not in the third position. Since the second position is A, T must be in one of the positions: 1, 4, or 5.

 The secret word pattern: _ A _ _ _

 We have to choose a word that:
   - Has the second letter as A (so we keep the known correct letter).
   - Includes the letter T in either position 1, 4, or 5 (to find its correct position).
   - Avoids the letters: C, R, N, E, P, I, O.

 We also want to test other common letters that we haven't tried yet. The remaining common letters include: S, L, D, U, M, B, G, Y, etc.

 Since we know the second letter is A, we can fix that and vary the others.

 Let's try to form a word that fits: _ A _ _ _

 We need to put T in position 1, 4, or 5.

 Option 1: T in position 1 -> T A _ _ _
 Option 2: T in position 4 -> _ A _ T _
 Option 3: T in position 5 -> _ A _ _ T

 We also need to fill the other positions with new letters (not in the excluded set).

 Let's think of words that fit:

 Option 1: T A _ _ _
   Possible words: TABBY, TABLA, TABLE, TABOO, ... but we have constraints:
   - Avoid E (so TABLE is out), avoid O (TABOO is out), avoid I, etc.

   TABBY: T, A, B, B, Y -> has duplicate B? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? We can use it? But we want to test new letters. Also, B and Y are new.

   However, we don't know if B is in the word? We can test.

   But note: we also have the letter T to place, and we are putting it at position 1. We know T is present, so if we put it at position 1 and it's correct, we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' meaning it's in the word but not at position 1? But wait, we know T is present, so if it's not at position 1, then it must be at 4 or 5.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has T in a position we are unsure about (like 4 or 5) to test.

   Since we have limited guesses, we should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

   How about ""TALKS""? But S is new, L is new, but K is also new? 
   However, in ""TALKS"": T at 1, A at 2 (correct), L at 3, K at 4, S at 5.
   But we are avoiding? We are avoiding C,R,N,E,P,I,O. So L, K, S are allowed.

   But note: we know T is present, and we are putting it at position 1. If the secret word has T at position 1, then we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' and then we know T must be at 4 or 5.

   However, we also have the feedback from the T in the previous guess: in ""patio"", T was at position 3 and we got a '-'. So T is not at position 3. But we are now trying position 1? That's fine.

   But wait: what if the secret word has two T's? We don't know. So we can try.

   However, ""TALKS"" has T at 1 and then no other T. So if the secret word has only one T, then if we get a ✓ for T at 1, then we know it's correct. If we get a '-', then we know T is at 4 or 5.

   But we also have to consider that the secret word might have two T's? It's possible, but we don't have evidence. We'll assume one for now.

   Alternatively, we can avoid putting T in the first position and instead put it in a position we haven't tried (like 4 or 5) to see if it belongs there.

   We have tried T in position 3 (in ""patio"") and got a '-'. We haven't tried position 1, 4, or 5.

   To maximize information, we might want to test T in a new position that we haven't tried, and also test other letters.

   Let me think of words with T in position 4: _ A _ T _
     Example: ""GASTS"" -> duplicate S? 
     Or ""BASTS"" -> duplicate S? 
     How about ""DAWTS""? D, A, W, T, S -> but we don't know D, W, S.

   Or with T in position 5: _ A _ _ T
     Example: ""FEAST"" -> but E is out. 
     ""BLAST"" -> but L, S, T: but we don't know if L and S are in? But B is new. However, we have to avoid E? ""BLAST"" has no E? B, L, A, S, T -> but A is at position 3? We need A at position 2. So we cannot use ""BLAST"" because the A is at position 3? Actually, in ""BLAST"": 
        Position 1: B
        Position 2: L -> not A? But we need the second letter to be A. So we must have the pattern: _ A _ _ T

     So the word must have the second letter A and the last letter T? 
        Example: ""HAVAT""? Not a word.
        ""BEAUT"" -> not a word? 
        ""DAVIT"" -> D, A, V, I, T -> but I is out? We cannot use I.

     Since I is out, we cannot use words with I.

     Another: ""YEAST"" -> E is out.

     How about ""MAKUT""? Not a word.

     This is difficult. Let me think of common words: 
        ""EXACT"" -> E and C are out.

     Maybe we should avoid position 5 for now.

   Alternatively, we can try T in position 4: _ A _ T _
     Words: ""FASTS"" -> duplicate S? 
            ""GAMUT"" -> G, A, M, U, T -> but then the T is at position 5? 
            We need T at position 4: so the word must be _ A _ T _
            Example: ""BAITH"" -> not common? 
            ""WAIFT"" -> not a word.

     How about ""HASTY"": H, A, S, T, Y -> 
        Position 1: H
        Position 2: A (correct)
        Position 3: S
        Position 4: T
        Position 5: Y

     This fits: _ A _ T _ -> H A S T Y

     And it uses H, S, T, Y. We know T is present, and we are testing it at position 4. Also, H, S, Y are new.

     The word ""HASTY"" is valid.

     But note: we are avoiding? H, S, T, Y are not in the excluded list (excluded: C,R,N,E,P,I,O). So it's okay.

     Also, we are testing S at position 3 and Y at position 5.

   Another option: ""PASTA"" -> but P is out? We cannot use P.

   So ""HASTY"" seems good.

   But wait, we also have the feedback that T is not in position 3. In ""HASTY"", we are putting T at position 4. That's a new position, so we can test.

   Alternatively, we can try T in position 1: ""TABBY"", ""TACKY"" (but C is out), ""TALKY"" (K and Y), ""TANSY"" (N is out), ""TAPAS"" (P is out). So ""TALKY"" is possible? T, A, L, K, Y -> but we don't know L, K, Y.

   However, we already have a candidate: ""HASTY"".

   Let me compare:
     ""TALKY"": tests T at position 1, A at 2 (correct), L at 3, K at 4, Y at 5.
     ""HASTY"": tests H at 1, A at 2 (correct), S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5.

   Both are valid. But note that in ""TALKY"", we are testing T at position 1. We know T is in the word, so if we put it at position 1 and it's correct, we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' meaning T is in the word but not at 1 (so it must be at 4 or 5). 

   Similarly, in ""HASTY"", we are testing T at position 4. If it's correct, we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' meaning T is in the word but not at 4 (so it must be at 1 or 5).

   We also get information about the other letters.

   Since we have only 4 guesses left (after this one), we want to maximize the chance of getting more information.

   The word ""HASTY"" has the advantage that it tests two common letters: S and H, and also Y.

   But note: we already know that the third position is not T (from the previous feedback). So in ""HASTY"", we are testing S at the third position. That might be useful.

   I think ""HASTY"" is a good choice.

   However, let me check if there is a word that tests more vowels? We haven't tested U? But we don't have any indication of vowels other than A. We know E and I and O are out? From the feedback, we have excluded E, I, O. So the only vowel left is U? And sometimes Y.

   We might consider including U? But we don't have to.

   I'll go with ""HASTY"".

   So the guess is: HASTY

   But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""HASTY"" is a valid English word.

   Therefore, we guess ""HASTY"".

<guess>hasty</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: A is in the word but not in position 3. C, R, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (PATIO)**: A is correct and in position 2. T is in the word but not in position 3. P, I, O are absent.

### Key Insights:
1. **Fixed Position**: The second letter is **A** (so the word pattern is `_ A _ _ _`).
2. **Confirmed Present**: **T** is in the word, but not in position 3 (so it must be in position 1, 4, or 5).
3. **Absent Letters**: C, R, N, E, P, I, O (cannot be used).
4. **Goal**: Test new common letters (e.g., S, L, H, Y) and verify T's position.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Use a word that:
  - Keeps **A** in position 2.
  - Places **T** in an untested position (position 4) to check if it belongs there.
  - Tests new high-frequency letters (H, S, Y) in unused positions.
  - Avoids all excluded letters.

**Chosen word: HASTY**  
- **H** (position 1): Tests a new consonant.  
- **A** (position 2): Confirmed correct (✓).  
- **S** (position 3): Tests a common letter in an open slot.  
- **T** (position 4): Tests T in a new position (previously tried in position 3).  
- **Y** (position 5): Tests a less common letter.  

This guess efficiently narrows down possibilities for T while maximizing new letter coverage.

Also, it does not contain C, R, N, or E.\n\n Since we have only one letter confirmed (A), and it\'s in the wrong position, we need to choose a new word that:\n 1. Contains the letter A in a different position (not the third).\n 2. Avoids the letters C, R, N, E.\n\n Also, we want to use this guess to test other common letters to get more information.\n\n Let\'s think about other common letters. After vowels, common consonants include T, S, L, etc.\n\n We know the secret word has 5 letters and must contain A somewhere.\n\n Possible positions for A: It could be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since it can\'t be in 3).\n\n We should choose a word that:\n - Has an A in either position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n - Does not contain C, R, N, E.\n - Includes other common letters we haven\'t tested yet, such as T, S, L, P, M, etc.\n\n Example words:\n - ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E -> but E is not allowed (we know E is out), so avoid E.\n - ""PLAIT"" has P, L, A, I, T -> but it\'s 5 letters and doesn\'t use C,R,N,E? Let\'s check: P, L, A, I, T -> all allowed? Yes.\n\n However, we don\'t know about I and T yet.\n\n Another idea: ""TASTY"" has two T\'s and A and S, but repeats T. We might not want to repeat letters to maximize information.\n\n Alternatively, ""SALAD"" has two A\'s? But we don\'t know if there are duplicate letters. It might be better to avoid duplicates unless we suspect them.\n\n Considering we have only 6 tries, we should aim to cover new letters.\n\n Let\'s choose a word that includes A and other vowels (we know E is out, so we can try I and O) and some consonants.\n\n We know E is out but other vowels: O, U, I are possible.\n\n Example: ""PAINT"" -> but N is out (from our feedback: N is x). So we cannot use N.\n\n Another: ""MAILS"" -> M, A, I, L, S -> no C,R,N,E. And positions: A is in the second position? In ""MAILS"", A is the third letter? We need to put A in a position that is not 3.\n\n We must avoid putting A in the third position because we already know it\'s not there.\n\n In ""MAILS"": M-A-I-L-S -> A is the second letter? Actually:\n Position 1: M\n Position 2: A\n Position 3: I\n Position 4: L\n Position 5: S\n\n So A is at position 2? That\'s acceptable.\n\n But wait: the feedback said A was in the word but not in the third position. It doesn\'t say it can\'t be in the third again? Actually, no: we know the secret word has exactly one A? Not necessarily, but let\'s proceed.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""PLAIT"":\n Position 1: P\n Position 2: L\n Position 3: A  -> but wait, we know A is not in the third position? \n However, the feedback only said that in the word ""crane"", the A in the third position was wrong. The secret word might have A in the third position again? Actually, no, because that A was at the same position? We are told that the letter is in the word but in the wrong position. Therefore, if we put A in the third position again, it might be the same mistake? Actually, if the secret word has A in the third position, then in our first guess we would have had a ✓ for A, but we had a \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not in the third position. Therefore, the secret word does not have A in the third position. So we should avoid putting A in the third position again.\n\n Therefore, in ""PLAIT"", A is in the third position -> same as before -> we know that the secret word doesn\'t have A in the third, so it would be inefficient to put it there again.\n\n So we must pick a word that has A in either position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\n Let\'s try to find a word that has A in position 1: \n Example: ""ADIEU"" -> but this has E (which is out) and D, I, U.\n\n Or ""AUDIO"" -> A in first, and U, D, I, O.\n\n But we avoid E? Yes, but E is out, so we can use U, D, I, O.\n\n However, we also want to test more consonants. We haven\'t tested T, S, L, etc.\n\n Another word: ""LASTS""? No, duplicate S.\n\n Alternatively: ""TALON"" -> T, A, L, O, N -> but N is out? Yes, N is not allowed.\n\n Since N is out, we cannot use words with N.\n\n With that in mind: let\'s avoid N, E, C, R.\n\n Another word: ""PATIO"" -> P, A, T, I, O \n Positions:\n  1: P\n  2: A (which is a new position -> we are testing A in second position? But we know A is somewhere, so putting it in second is acceptable)\n\n However, note that in ""crane"", A was in position 3 and we were told it\'s not there. Now in second? It might be the correct position.\n\n Alternatively: ""MANIA"" -> M, A, N, I, A -> N is out? Yes, so invalid.\n\n How about ""SOLAR"" -> S, O, L, A, R -> R is out? Yes, we cannot use R.\n\n So we must avoid R? Yes.\n\n So prohibited letters: C, R, N, E.\n\n We are allowed: A (which we must include) and any other letters except these.\n\n Common letters left: T, S, L, O, P, M, I, U, etc.\n\n Let me try to form a word that has A and four new common letters.\n\n Word: ""PASTY"" -> P, A, S, T, Y -> positions: \n  1: P\n  2: A -> but that\'s position 2? We don\'t know if position 2 is correct for A? We are trying to see if it can be at position 2.\n\n Alternatively, put A in position 4: \n Word: ""OPALS"" -> O, P, A, L, S -> but the word is OPALS? Or ""PALSY""? \n\n Actually, ""PALSY"" is a word: P, A, L, S, Y -> then A is at position 2 again? \n\n How about ""TOPAZ"": T, O, P, A, Z -> A is at position 4 -> great! \n But let me check if that is a valid English word: topaz is a gemstone -> valid.\n\n But note: we haven\'t tested S and L? But we can test others.\n\n Alternatively, ""PLASM"" -> not a word? \n\n Another one: ""QUASH"" -> Q, U, A, S, H -> A is at position 3? We cannot put A at position 3. In ""QUASH"", the A is at the fourth letter? \n Q-U-A-S-H -> positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:A, 4:S, 5:H -> oh, it\'s at 3? Avoided.\n\n How about ""DAISY""? D, A, I, S, Y -> A at position 2? But we don\'t know D? \n\n We haven\'t tested D? So it\'s okay.\n\n But note: we are avoiding E, C, R, N -> so D is allowed.\n\n However, we want to maximize the number of new letters. Also, note that we have only tested a few letters: C,R,A,N,E. So we have many letters left.\n\n I think ""DAISY"" is okay? But in the word, A is at position 2. We don\'t know about D, I, S, Y.\n\n Alternatively, let\'s use a word with A at the beginning? ""ANGRY"" -> N and R are out -> no.\n\n Another word: ""PATIO"" -> P, A, T, I, O -> which we mentioned earlier: A is at position 2? \n Positions: \n  1: P\n  2: A (this avoids position 3)\n  3: T\n  4: I\n  5: O\n\n No duplicate letters. And none of the forbidden letters.\n\n This word tests: P, A (in position 2), T, I, O.\n\n We haven\'t tested P, T, I, O yet? And A we know is present, but we are also testing if position 2 is correct.\n\n Therefore, ""PATIO"" seems like a good candidate.\n\n But note: the feedback from the first guess told us that A was in the word but not in position 3. Now we are putting it in position 2. If the secret word has A in position 2, then we\'ll get a ✓ for that A. Otherwise, if A is in another position, we\'ll get \'-\'.\n\n So let\'s go with ""PATIO"".\n\n<guess>patio</guess>Based on the previous feedback:\n- The secret word contains \'A\', but not in the third position.\n- The letters C, R, N, and E are not in the word.\n\nFor this guess, I chose ""patio"" because:\n- It includes the confirmed letter \'A\' in a new position (second slot) to test if it belongs there.\n- It introduces new common letters (P, T, I, O) that haven\'t been tested yet.\n- It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, N, E) and positions (third slot for \'A\').\n\nThis guess maximizes information gain about the secret word\'s composition.\n\n<guess>patio</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: patio -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) T(-) I(x) O(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback on the second guess ""patio"":\n P: x -> not in the word\n A: ✓ -> in the word and in the CORRECT position (so the second letter of the secret word is A)\n T: - -> in the word but in the wrong position\n I: x -> not in the word\n O: x -> not in the word\n\n Now we know:\n - The second letter of the secret word is A.

If we get a \'-\', then we know T is at 4 or 5.\n\n   But we also have to consider that the secret word might have two T\'s? It\'s possible, but we don\'t have evidence. We\'ll assume one for now.\n\n   Alternatively, we can avoid putting T in the first position and instead put it in a position we haven\'t tried (like 4 or 5) to see if it belongs there.\n\n   We have tried T in position 3 (in ""patio"") and got a \'-\'. We haven\'t tried position 1, 4, or 5.\n\n   To maximize information, we might want to test T in a new position that we haven\'t tried, and also test other letters.\n\n   Let me think of words with T in position 4: _ A _ T _\n     Example: ""GASTS"" -> duplicate S? \n     Or ""BASTS"" -> duplicate S? \n     How about ""DAWTS""?

Let me think of common words: \n        ""EXACT"" -> E and C are out.\n\n     Maybe we should avoid position 5 for now.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try T in position 4: _ A _ T _\n     Words: ""FASTS"" -> duplicate S? \n            ""GAMUT"" -> G, A, M, U, T -> but then the T is at position 5? \n            We need T at position 4: so the word must be _ A _ T _\n            Example: ""BAITH"" -> not common? \n            ""WAIFT"" -> not a word.\n\n     How about ""HASTY"": H, A, S, T, Y -> \n        Position 1: H\n        Position 2: A (correct)\n        Position 3: S\n        Position 4: T\n        Position 5: Y\n\n     This fits: _ A _ T _ -> H A S T Y\n\n     And it uses H, S, T, Y. We know T is present, and we are testing it at position 4. Also, H, S, Y are new.\n\n     The word ""HASTY"" is valid.\n\n     But note: we are avoiding? H, S, T, Y are not in the excluded list (excluded: C,R,N,E,P,I,O). So it\'s okay.\n\n     Also, we are testing S at position 3 and Y at position 5.\n\n   Another option: ""PASTA"" -> but P is out? We cannot use P.\n\n   So ""HASTY"" seems good.\n\n   But wait, we also have the feedback that T is not in position 3. In ""HASTY"", we are putting T at position 4. That\'s a new position, so we can test.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try T in position 1: ""TABBY"", ""TACKY"" (but C is out), ""TALKY"" (K and Y), ""TANSY"" (N is out), ""TAPAS"" (P is out). So ""TALKY"" is possible? T, A, L, K, Y -> but we don\'t know L, K, Y.\n\n   However, we already have a candidate: ""HASTY"".\n\n   Let me compare:\n     ""TALKY"": tests T at position 1, A at 2 (correct), L at 3, K at 4, Y at 5.\n     ""HASTY"": tests H at 1, A at 2 (correct), S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5.\n\n   Both are valid. But note that in ""TALKY"", we are testing T at position 1. We know T is in the word, so if we put it at position 1 and it\'s correct, we get a ✓. If not, we get a \'-\' meaning T is in the word but not at 1 (so it must be at 4 or 5). \n\n   Similarly, in ""HASTY"", we are testing T at position 4. If it\'s correct, we get a ✓. If not, we get a \'-\' meaning T is in the word but not at 4 (so it must be at 1 or 5).\n\n   We also get information about the other letters.\n\n   Since we have only 4 guesses left (after this one), we want to maximize the chance of getting more information.\n\n   The word ""HASTY"" has the advantage that it tests two common letters: S and H, and also Y.\n\n   But note: we already know that the third position is not T (from the previous feedback). So in ""HASTY"", we are testing S at the third position. That might be useful.\n\n   I think ""HASTY"" is a good choice.\n\n   However, let me check if there is a word that tests more vowels? We haven\'t tested U? But we don\'t have any indication of vowels other than A. We know E and I and O are out? From the feedback, we have excluded E, I, O. So the only vowel left is U? And sometimes Y.\n\n   We might consider including U? But we don\'t have to.\n\n   I\'ll go with ""HASTY"".\n\n   So the guess is: HASTY\n\n   But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""HASTY"" is a valid English word.\n\n   Therefore, we guess ""HASTY"".\n\n<guess>hasty</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: A is in the word but not in position 3.

We are given feedback on the third guess ""hasty"":
 H: x -> not in the word
 A: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (second letter, as we already knew)
 S: x -> not in the word
 T: - -> in the word but wrong position (so T is present, but not in the fourth position)
 Y: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (fifth letter)

 So, we now know:
 - The second letter is A (position 2) and the fifth letter is Y (position 5). So the word pattern is: _ A _ _ Y
 - The letter T is in the word, but not in the fourth position. Since we now know the fifth letter is Y, T cannot be at position 5 either. Therefore, T must be in position 1 or 3? 
   But note: the word has positions: 1,2,3,4,5. We know:
     Position 2: A
     Position 5: Y
   We have tried T in position 3 (in ""patio"") and position 4 (in ""hasty"") and both were wrong. So T must be in position 1? Because that's the only position left? 
   However, we haven't tried position 1 for T yet.

   But wait: in ""patio"", T was at position 3 -> wrong position (but present). In ""hasty"", T was at position 4 -> wrong position (but present). So T is not at 3 or 4. And we know it's not at 2 (which is A) and not at 5 (which is Y). Therefore, the only possibility is position 1.

   Therefore, T must be the first letter.

   So the word is: T A _ _ Y

 - Also, we have new absent letters: H and S (from ""hasty""). So we add H and S to the absent list.

 Now, the absent letters are: C, R, N, E, P, I, O, H, S.

 We are missing the third and fourth letters.

 The word pattern: T A _ _ Y

 We need to fill in the two middle letters (positions 3 and 4) with letters that are not in the absent list.

 Available letters: we have to avoid: C, R, N, E, P, I, O, H, S.

 What letters are left? 
   A to Z without: C, E, H, I, N, O, P, R, S.

 Remaining: A, B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 But note: we already have T and A and Y in the word. The word is T A _ _ Y. We don't know if there are duplicate letters? But we haven't seen any duplicates so far.

 We need to choose a word that fits: T A _ _ Y

 And we want to test the two missing letters.

 We can try to form a word with the available letters.

 Common words: 
   ""TASTY"" -> but S is absent? We cannot use S. Also, T is already at the start and we don't know if we can have another T? But we haven't ruled out duplicates. However, we have T at position 1 and we are going to put T at position 3? But ""TASTY"" has T at 1 and 4? Actually: T A S T Y -> but S is absent and we have two T's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed? But the feedback hasn't shown any duplicate so far. However, we cannot use S.

   ""TABBY"" -> T A B B Y -> B is available? Yes. But we have two B's? 
   ""TABBY"" is a word. It has B at positions 3 and 4.

   But we don't know if B is in the word? We can test.

   However, we have only two positions to fill and we have two letters to test? But we can test two new letters at once? Or we can try to get as much information as possible.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that uses two different new letters.

   Example: ""TALKY"" -> T A L K Y -> L and K are available? Yes. 
   But note: we have already tried L? No, we haven't. And K is new.

   But wait: in the previous feedback, we have not tested L or K.

   However, we have only two positions: 3 and 4. So if we guess ""TALKY"", then:
      Position 3: L
      Position 4: K

   If we get feedback: 
      T: ✓ (position 1)
      A: ✓ (position 2)
      L: ? 
      K: ?
      Y: ✓ (position 5)

   Then we will know if L and K are in the word and in the correct positions.

   But note: we are not sure if the word has duplicate letters? But we don't have any duplicate in this guess.

   However, we have a constraint: we have only 3 guesses left? Actually, we are on the fourth guess (after three guesses). We have 3 more guesses? The game allows 6 guesses.

   We can also try to cover more letters? But we have two positions and we are testing two letters. That's efficient.

   But what if the word is ""TABBY""? Then we would not get it because we are using L and K.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that uses one common letter and one less common? But we don't have much information.

   How about ""TARDY""? But R is absent? We cannot use R.

   ""TANGY"": T A N G Y -> but N is absent? We cannot use N.

   ""TAMMY"": M is available? Yes, but duplicate M? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed? Also, M is available? But we haven't tested M.

   However, we are avoiding the absent letters.

   Let me list possible words that fit T A _ _ Y and use only the available letters.

   Some options:
     - ""TABBY"" (B,B)
     - ""TACKY"" (C is absent? C is in the absent list -> cannot use)
     - ""TALLY"" (L,L) -> but we don't know if duplicates are allowed? And we haven't tested L.
     - ""TALKY"" (L,K) -> valid word? Yes, meaning talkative? Slang, but acceptable.
     - ""TAMMY"" (M,M) -> a name? But might be accepted.
     - ""TANZY"" (N is absent) -> no.
     - ""TAPPY"" (P is absent) -> no.
     - ""TARZY"" (R absent) -> no.
     - ""TAWNY"" (W,N) -> N is absent -> no.
     - ""TAFFY"" (F,F) -> valid word: taffy candy.

   So we have: 
        TABBY: B and B
        TALKY: L and K
        TAMMY: M and M
        TAFFY: F and F

   And also: ""TAXPY""? Not a word.

   How about ""TALKY"" and ""TAFFY"" are the ones without duplicates? Actually, ""TALKY"" has two distinct letters? T, A, L, K, Y -> all distinct? Yes.

   But note: we have T and then L and K. We don't know if L or K are in the word.

   Alternatively, we can try ""TAFFY"": T, A, F, F, Y -> duplicate F? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The feedback so far hasn't shown duplicates, but it's possible.

   We need to choose one.

   Since we have limited guesses, we might want to test two new letters that are common? But L is more common than F? 

   However, we are not sure.

   Another idea: we can try a word that uses two different common letters? The most common letters left are: L, D, U, M, W, etc.

   How about ""DAILY""? But we have to start with T and end with Y? Our word must be T A _ _ Y.

   So we cannot use ""DAILY"".

   We must stick to the pattern.

   I think ""TALKY"" is a good choice because it tests two new letters: L and K.

   But note: if the word is ""TABBY"", then we won't get it, but we will know that L and K are absent? Then we can try ""TABBY"" next? But we have two guesses left after this? Actually, we are on the fourth guess, so we have two more after this? Total 6 guesses: we have used 3, so 3 left? Actually, we are about to make the fourth guess, then we have two more.

   Alternatively, we can try ""TAFFY"" to test F? But F is less common.

   How about ""TALLY""? T A L L Y -> duplicate L? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? If we try ""TALLY"", then we are testing L at position 3 and 4? But we get two L's? The feedback might be:

      T: ✓
      A: ✓
      L: if the word has L at position 3, then ✓, and if at position 4 then ✓? But if the word has only one L, then one of them will be absent? Or if the word has two L's? 

   But we don't know. It might be messy.

   So to avoid confusion, we can try a word with two distinct new letters.

   Therefore, I choose ""TALKY"".

   But wait: is ""TALKY"" a valid word? It is in some dictionaries as an adjective meaning talkative. We'll assume it's acceptable.

   Alternatively, we can use ""TAWNY"" but N is absent? No.

   Another word: ""TAKHY""? Not a word.

   How about ""TAMLY""? Not common.

   So I think ""TALKY"" is acceptable.

   But note: we have the letter Y at the end, which we already know is correct. So we are only testing the two middle letters.

   We'll guess ""TALKY"".

   However, let me check if there is a word that uses more common letters? 

   How about ""TALKY"" uses L and K. Another common letter is M? We can try ""TAMMY"", but that has duplicate M? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed? 

   Alternatively, ""TAMED"" -> but E is absent and we need to end with Y.

   I think ""TALKY"" is the best.

   So we guess: TALKY

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**:  
  - `C` (absent), `R` (absent), `A` (present, wrong position), `N` (absent), `E` (absent).  
- **Guess 2 (PATIO)**:  
  - `P` (absent), `A` (✓ correct position), `T` (present, wrong position), `I` (absent), `O` (absent).  
- **Guess 3 (HASTY)**:  
  - `H` (absent), `A` (✓ correct position), `S` (absent), `T` (present, wrong position), `Y` (✓ correct position).  

### Key Insights:
1. **Fixed Letters**:  
   - Position 2: **A** (confirmed in both Guess 2 and 3).  
   - Position 5: **Y** (confirmed in Guess 3).  
   - The word pattern is `_ A _ _ Y`.  

2. **Confirmed Present (but Position Unknown)**:  
   - **T** is in the word but not in position 3 (from Guess 2) or position 4 (from Guess 3).  
   - Since positions 2 and 5 are fixed, **T must be in position 1** (the only remaining position).  
   - Thus, the word starts with **T**: `T A _ _ Y`.  

3. **Absent Letters**:  
   - **C, R, N, E, P, I, O, H, S** (cannot appear anywhere).  

4. **Unknown Positions**:  
   - Positions 3 and 4 need to be filled with letters not in the absent list.  
   - Available letters: **A, B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z** (and **T, A, Y** are already used but may repeat; no duplicates seen yet).  

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- **Goal**: Test plausible letters for positions 3 and 4 while adhering to the pattern `T A _ _ Y`.  
- **Chosen Word: TALKY**  
  - Tests **L** in position 3 and **K** in position 4 (both new, high-frequency consonants).  
  - Avoids all absent letters.  
  - If incorrect, feedback will confirm/reject **L** and **K**, narrowing options further.  

<guess>talky</guess>",talky,"We are given feedback on the third guess ""hasty"":
 H: x -> not in the word
 A: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (second letter, as we already knew)
 S: x -> not in the word
 T: - -> in the word but wrong position (so T is present, but not in the fourth position)
 Y: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (fifth letter)

 So, we now know:
 - The second letter is A (position 2) and the fifth letter is Y (position 5). So the word pattern is: _ A _ _ Y
 - The letter T is in the word, but not in the fourth position. Since we now know the fifth letter is Y, T cannot be at position 5 either. Therefore, T must be in position 1 or 3? 
   But note: the word has positions: 1,2,3,4,5. We know:
     Position 2: A
     Position 5: Y
   We have tried T in position 3 (in ""patio"") and position 4 (in ""hasty"") and both were wrong. So T must be in position 1? Because that's the only position left? 
   However, we haven't tried position 1 for T yet.

   But wait: in ""patio"", T was at position 3 -> wrong position (but present). In ""hasty"", T was at position 4 -> wrong position (but present). So T is not at 3 or 4. And we know it's not at 2 (which is A) and not at 5 (which is Y). Therefore, the only possibility is position 1.

   Therefore, T must be the first letter.

   So the word is: T A _ _ Y

 - Also, we have new absent letters: H and S (from ""hasty""). So we add H and S to the absent list.

 Now, the absent letters are: C, R, N, E, P, I, O, H, S.

 We are missing the third and fourth letters.

 The word pattern: T A _ _ Y

 We need to fill in the two middle letters (positions 3 and 4) with letters that are not in the absent list.

 Available letters: we have to avoid: C, R, N, E, P, I, O, H, S.

 What letters are left? 
   A to Z without: C, E, H, I, N, O, P, R, S.

 Remaining: A, B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We don't know if duplicates are allowed? But the feedback hasn't shown any duplicate so far. However, we cannot use S.

   ""TABBY"" -> T A B B Y -> B is available? Yes. But we have two B's? 
   ""TABBY"" is a word. It has B at positions 3 and 4.

   But we don't know if B is in the word? We can test.

   However, we have only two positions to fill and we have two letters to test? But we can test two new letters at once? Or we can try to get as much information as possible.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that uses two different new letters.

   Example: ""TALKY"" -> T A L K Y -> L and K are available? Yes. 
   But note: we have already tried L? No, we haven't. And K is new.

   But wait: in the previous feedback, we have not tested L or K.

   However, we have only two positions: 3 and 4. So if we guess ""TALKY"", then:
      Position 3: L
      Position 4: K

   If we get feedback:

      A: ✓ (position 2)

     - ""TAWNY"" (W,N) -> N is absent -> no.
     - ""TAFFY"" (F,F) -> valid word: taffy candy.

   So we have: 
        TABBY: B and B
        TALKY: L and K
        TAMMY: M and M
        TAFFY: F and F

   And also: ""TAXPY""? Not a word.

   How about ""DAILY""? But we have to start with T and end with Y? Our word must be T A _ _ Y.

   So we cannot use ""DAILY"".

   We must stick to the pattern.

   I think ""TALKY"" is a good choice because it tests two new letters: L and K.

   But note: if the word is ""TABBY"", then we won't get it, but we will know that L and K are absent? Then we can try ""TABBY"" next? But we have two guesses left after this? Actually, we are on the fourth guess, so we have two more after this? Total 6 guesses: we have used 3, so 3 left? Actually, we are about to make the fourth guess, then we have two more.

1. **Fixed Letters**:  
   - Position 2: **A** (confirmed in both Guess 2 and 3).  
   - Position 5: **Y** (confirmed in Guess 3).  
   - The word pattern is `_ A _ _ Y`.  

2. **Confirmed Present (but Position Unknown)**:  
   - **T** is in the word but not in position 3 (from Guess 2) or position 4 (from Guess 3).  
   - Since positions 2 and 5 are fixed, **T must be in position 1** (the only remaining position).  
   - Thus, the word starts with **T**: `T A _ _ Y`.  

3. **Absent Letters**:  
   - **C, R, N, E, P, I, O, H, S** (cannot appear anywhere).  

4. **Unknown Positions**:  
   - Positions 3 and 4 need to be filled with letters not in the absent list.  
   - Available letters: **A, B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z** (and **T, A, Y** are already used but may repeat; no duplicates seen yet).  

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- **Goal**: Test plausible letters for positions 3 and 4 while adhering to the pattern `T A _ _ Y`.  
- **Chosen Word: TALKY**  
  - Tests **L** in position 3 and **K** in position 4 (both new, high-frequency consonants).  
  - Avoids all absent letters.  
  - If incorrect, feedback will confirm/reject **L** and **K**, narrowing options further.",Guess 4: talky -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) A(✓) L(x) K(x) Y(✓),FAIL

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has three vowels and two common consonants. The word ""ROATE"" is sometimes used, but let me pick a more common one.
 Alternatively, ""CRANE"" is a popular choice because it has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' — which are common letters.

 However, note that the game requires a valid 5-letter English word.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess.

 So, my first guess is: CRANE

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x -> not in the word
 R: x -> not in the word
 A: - -> in the word but wrong position
 N: x -> not in the word
 E: x -> not in the word

 So, we know:
 - The letter A is present in the secret word, but not in the second position (since in ""crane"" it was the third letter).
 - The letters C, R, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, but not in the third position. Also, it does not contain C, R, N, or E.

 Since we have only one letter confirmed (A), and it's in the wrong position, we need to choose a new word that:
 1. Contains the letter A in a different position (not the third).
 2. Avoids the letters C, R, N, E.

 Also, we want to use this guess to test other common letters to get more information.

 Let's think about other common letters. After vowels, common consonants include T, S, L, etc.

 We know the secret word has 5 letters and must contain A somewhere.

 Possible positions for A: It could be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since it can't be in 3).

 We should choose a word that:
 - Has an A in either position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
 - Does not contain C, R, N, E.
 - Includes other common letters we haven't tested yet, such as T, S, L, P, M, etc.

 Example words:
 - ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E -> but E is not allowed (we know E is out), so avoid E.
 - ""PLAIT"" has P, L, A, I, T -> but it's 5 letters and doesn't use C,R,N,E? Let's check: P, L, A, I, T -> all allowed? Yes.

 However, we don't know about I and T yet.

 Another idea: ""TASTY"" has two T's and A and S, but repeats T. We might not want to repeat letters to maximize information.

 Alternatively, ""SALAD"" has two A's? But we don't know if there are duplicate letters. It might be better to avoid duplicates unless we suspect them.

 Considering we have only 6 tries, we should aim to cover new letters.

 Let's choose a word that includes A and other vowels (we know E is out, so we can try I and O) and some consonants.

 We know E is out but other vowels: O, U, I are possible.

 Example: ""PAINT"" -> but N is out (from our feedback: N is x). So we cannot use N.

 Another: ""MAILS"" -> M, A, I, L, S -> no C,R,N,E. And positions: A is in the second position? In ""MAILS"", A is the third letter? We need to put A in a position that is not 3.

 We must avoid putting A in the third position because we already know it's not there.

 In ""MAILS"": M-A-I-L-S -> A is the second letter? Actually:
 Position 1: M
 Position 2: A
 Position 3: I
 Position 4: L
 Position 5: S

 So A is at position 2? That's acceptable.

 But wait: the feedback said A was in the word but not in the third position. It doesn't say it can't be in the third again? Actually, no: we know the secret word has exactly one A? Not necessarily, but let's proceed.

 Alternatively, we can try ""PLAIT"":
 Position 1: P
 Position 2: L
 Position 3: A  -> but wait, we know A is not in the third position? 
 However, the feedback only said that in the word ""crane"", the A in the third position was wrong. The secret word might have A in the third position again? Actually, no, because that A was at the same position? We are told that the letter is in the word but in the wrong position. Therefore, if we put A in the third position again, it might be the same mistake? Actually, if the secret word has A in the third position, then in our first guess we would have had a ✓ for A, but we had a '-' meaning it is in the word but not in the third position. Therefore, the secret word does not have A in the third position. So we should avoid putting A in the third position again.

 Therefore, in ""PLAIT"", A is in the third position -> same as before -> we know that the secret word doesn't have A in the third, so it would be inefficient to put it there again.

 So we must pick a word that has A in either position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Let's try to find a word that has A in position 1: 
 Example: ""ADIEU"" -> but this has E (which is out) and D, I, U.

 Or ""AUDIO"" -> A in first, and U, D, I, O.

 But we avoid E? Yes, but E is out, so we can use U, D, I, O.

 However, we also want to test more consonants. We haven't tested T, S, L, etc.

 Another word: ""LASTS""? No, duplicate S.

 Alternatively: ""TALON"" -> T, A, L, O, N -> but N is out? Yes, N is not allowed.

 Since N is out, we cannot use words with N.

 With that in mind: let's avoid N, E, C, R.

 Another word: ""PATIO"" -> P, A, T, I, O 
 Positions:
  1: P
  2: A (which is a new position -> we are testing A in second position? But we know A is somewhere, so putting it in second is acceptable)

 However, note that in ""crane"", A was in position 3 and we were told it's not there. Now in second? It might be the correct position.

 Alternatively: ""MANIA"" -> M, A, N, I, A -> N is out? Yes, so invalid.

 How about ""SOLAR"" -> S, O, L, A, R -> R is out? Yes, we cannot use R.

 So we must avoid R? Yes.

 So prohibited letters: C, R, N, E.

 We are allowed: A (which we must include) and any other letters except these.

 Common letters left: T, S, L, O, P, M, I, U, etc.

 Let me try to form a word that has A and four new common letters.

 Word: ""PASTY"" -> P, A, S, T, Y -> positions: 
  1: P
  2: A -> but that's position 2? We don't know if position 2 is correct for A? We are trying to see if it can be at position 2.

 Alternatively, put A in position 4: 
 Word: ""OPALS"" -> O, P, A, L, S -> but the word is OPALS? Or ""PALSY""? 

 Actually, ""PALSY"" is a word: P, A, L, S, Y -> then A is at position 2 again? 

 How about ""TOPAZ"": T, O, P, A, Z -> A is at position 4 -> great! 
 But let me check if that is a valid English word: topaz is a gemstone -> valid.

 But note: we haven't tested S and L? But we can test others.

 Alternatively, ""PLASM"" -> not a word? 

 Another one: ""QUASH"" -> Q, U, A, S, H -> A is at position 3? We cannot put A at position 3. In ""QUASH"", the A is at the fourth letter? 
 Q-U-A-S-H -> positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:A, 4:S, 5:H -> oh, it's at 3? Avoided.

 How about ""DAISY""? D, A, I, S, Y -> A at position 2? But we don't know D? 

 We haven't tested D? So it's okay.

 But note: we are avoiding E, C, R, N -> so D is allowed.

 However, we want to maximize the number of new letters. Also, note that we have only tested a few letters: C,R,A,N,E. So we have many letters left.

 I think ""DAISY"" is okay? But in the word, A is at position 2. We don't know about D, I, S, Y.

 Alternatively, let's use a word with A at the beginning? ""ANGRY"" -> N and R are out -> no.

 Another word: ""PATIO"" -> P, A, T, I, O -> which we mentioned earlier: A is at position 2? 
 Positions: 
  1: P
  2: A (this avoids position 3)
  3: T
  4: I
  5: O

 No duplicate letters. And none of the forbidden letters.

 This word tests: P, A (in position 2), T, I, O.

 We haven't tested P, T, I, O yet? And A we know is present, but we are also testing if position 2 is correct.

 Therefore, ""PATIO"" seems like a good candidate.

 But note: the feedback from the first guess told us that A was in the word but not in position 3. Now we are putting it in position 2. If the secret word has A in position 2, then we'll get a ✓ for that A. Otherwise, if A is in another position, we'll get '-'.

 So let's go with ""PATIO"".

<guess>patio</guess>Based on the previous feedback:
- The secret word contains 'A', but not in the third position.
- The letters C, R, N, and E are not in the word.

For this guess, I chose ""patio"" because:
- It includes the confirmed letter 'A' in a new position (second slot) to test if it belongs there.
- It introduces new common letters (P, T, I, O) that haven't been tested yet.
- It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, N, E) and positions (third slot for 'A').

This guess maximizes information gain about the secret word's composition.

<guess>patio</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: patio -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) T(-) I(x) O(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the second guess ""patio"":
 P: x -> not in the word
 A: ✓ -> in the word and in the CORRECT position (so the second letter of the secret word is A)
 T: - -> in the word but in the wrong position
 I: x -> not in the word
 O: x -> not in the word

 Now we know:
 - The second letter of the secret word is A. So the word has the form _ A _ _ _
 - The letter T is in the word, but not in the third position (because in ""patio"", T was in the third position and we got a '-' meaning it's present but not there).
 - The letters P, I, O are not in the word. Also, from the first guess, we know C, R, N, E are not in the word.

 So, total letters that are out: C, R, N, E, P, I, O.

 We also know that T is present, but not in the third position. Since the second position is A, T must be in one of the positions: 1, 4, or 5.

 The secret word pattern: _ A _ _ _

 We have to choose a word that:
   - Has the second letter as A (so we keep the known correct letter).
   - Includes the letter T in either position 1, 4, or 5 (to find its correct position).
   - Avoids the letters: C, R, N, E, P, I, O.

 We also want to test other common letters that we haven't tried yet. The remaining common letters include: S, L, D, U, M, B, G, Y, etc.

 Since we know the second letter is A, we can fix that and vary the others.

 Let's try to form a word that fits: _ A _ _ _

 We need to put T in position 1, 4, or 5.

 Option 1: T in position 1 -> T A _ _ _
 Option 2: T in position 4 -> _ A _ T _
 Option 3: T in position 5 -> _ A _ _ T

 We also need to fill the other positions with new letters (not in the excluded set).

 Let's think of words that fit:

 Option 1: T A _ _ _
   Possible words: TABBY, TABLA, TABLE, TABOO, ... but we have constraints:
   - Avoid E (so TABLE is out), avoid O (TABOO is out), avoid I, etc.

   TABBY: T, A, B, B, Y -> has duplicate B? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? We can use it? But we want to test new letters. Also, B and Y are new.

   However, we don't know if B is in the word? We can test.

   But note: we also have the letter T to place, and we are putting it at position 1. We know T is present, so if we put it at position 1 and it's correct, we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' meaning it's in the word but not at position 1? But wait, we know T is present, so if it's not at position 1, then it must be at 4 or 5.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has T in a position we are unsure about (like 4 or 5) to test.

   Since we have limited guesses, we should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

   How about ""TALKS""? But S is new, L is new, but K is also new? 
   However, in ""TALKS"": T at 1, A at 2 (correct), L at 3, K at 4, S at 5.
   But we are avoiding? We are avoiding C,R,N,E,P,I,O. So L, K, S are allowed.

   But note: we know T is present, and we are putting it at position 1. If the secret word has T at position 1, then we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' and then we know T must be at 4 or 5.

   However, we also have the feedback from the T in the previous guess: in ""patio"", T was at position 3 and we got a '-'. So T is not at position 3. But we are now trying position 1? That's fine.

   But wait: what if the secret word has two T's? We don't know. So we can try.

   However, ""TALKS"" has T at 1 and then no other T. So if the secret word has only one T, then if we get a ✓ for T at 1, then we know it's correct. If we get a '-', then we know T is at 4 or 5.

   But we also have to consider that the secret word might have two T's? It's possible, but we don't have evidence. We'll assume one for now.

   Alternatively, we can avoid putting T in the first position and instead put it in a position we haven't tried (like 4 or 5) to see if it belongs there.

   We have tried T in position 3 (in ""patio"") and got a '-'. We haven't tried position 1, 4, or 5.

   To maximize information, we might want to test T in a new position that we haven't tried, and also test other letters.

   Let me think of words with T in position 4: _ A _ T _
     Example: ""GASTS"" -> duplicate S? 
     Or ""BASTS"" -> duplicate S? 
     How about ""DAWTS""? D, A, W, T, S -> but we don't know D, W, S.

   Or with T in position 5: _ A _ _ T
     Example: ""FEAST"" -> but E is out. 
     ""BLAST"" -> but L, S, T: but we don't know if L and S are in? But B is new. However, we have to avoid E? ""BLAST"" has no E? B, L, A, S, T -> but A is at position 3? We need A at position 2. So we cannot use ""BLAST"" because the A is at position 3? Actually, in ""BLAST"": 
        Position 1: B
        Position 2: L -> not A? But we need the second letter to be A. So we must have the pattern: _ A _ _ T

     So the word must have the second letter A and the last letter T? 
        Example: ""HAVAT""? Not a word.
        ""BEAUT"" -> not a word? 
        ""DAVIT"" -> D, A, V, I, T -> but I is out? We cannot use I.

     Since I is out, we cannot use words with I.

     Another: ""YEAST"" -> E is out.

     How about ""MAKUT""? Not a word.

     This is difficult. Let me think of common words: 
        ""EXACT"" -> E and C are out.

     Maybe we should avoid position 5 for now.

   Alternatively, we can try T in position 4: _ A _ T _
     Words: ""FASTS"" -> duplicate S? 
            ""GAMUT"" -> G, A, M, U, T -> but then the T is at position 5? 
            We need T at position 4: so the word must be _ A _ T _
            Example: ""BAITH"" -> not common? 
            ""WAIFT"" -> not a word.

     How about ""HASTY"": H, A, S, T, Y -> 
        Position 1: H
        Position 2: A (correct)
        Position 3: S
        Position 4: T
        Position 5: Y

     This fits: _ A _ T _ -> H A S T Y

     And it uses H, S, T, Y. We know T is present, and we are testing it at position 4. Also, H, S, Y are new.

     The word ""HASTY"" is valid.

     But note: we are avoiding? H, S, T, Y are not in the excluded list (excluded: C,R,N,E,P,I,O). So it's okay.

     Also, we are testing S at position 3 and Y at position 5.

   Another option: ""PASTA"" -> but P is out? We cannot use P.

   So ""HASTY"" seems good.

   But wait, we also have the feedback that T is not in position 3. In ""HASTY"", we are putting T at position 4. That's a new position, so we can test.

   Alternatively, we can try T in position 1: ""TABBY"", ""TACKY"" (but C is out), ""TALKY"" (K and Y), ""TANSY"" (N is out), ""TAPAS"" (P is out). So ""TALKY"" is possible? T, A, L, K, Y -> but we don't know L, K, Y.

   However, we already have a candidate: ""HASTY"".

   Let me compare:
     ""TALKY"": tests T at position 1, A at 2 (correct), L at 3, K at 4, Y at 5.
     ""HASTY"": tests H at 1, A at 2 (correct), S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5.

   Both are valid. But note that in ""TALKY"", we are testing T at position 1. We know T is in the word, so if we put it at position 1 and it's correct, we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' meaning T is in the word but not at 1 (so it must be at 4 or 5). 

   Similarly, in ""HASTY"", we are testing T at position 4. If it's correct, we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' meaning T is in the word but not at 4 (so it must be at 1 or 5).

   We also get information about the other letters.

   Since we have only 4 guesses left (after this one), we want to maximize the chance of getting more information.

   The word ""HASTY"" has the advantage that it tests two common letters: S and H, and also Y.

   But note: we already know that the third position is not T (from the previous feedback). So in ""HASTY"", we are testing S at the third position. That might be useful.

   I think ""HASTY"" is a good choice.

   However, let me check if there is a word that tests more vowels? We haven't tested U? But we don't have any indication of vowels other than A. We know E and I and O are out? From the feedback, we have excluded E, I, O. So the only vowel left is U? And sometimes Y.

   We might consider including U? But we don't have to.

   I'll go with ""HASTY"".

   So the guess is: HASTY

   But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""HASTY"" is a valid English word.

   Therefore, we guess ""HASTY"".

<guess>hasty</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: A is in the word but not in position 3. C, R, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (PATIO)**: A is correct and in position 2. T is in the word but not in position 3. P, I, O are absent.

### Key Insights:
1. **Fixed Position**: The second letter is **A** (so the word pattern is `_ A _ _ _`).
2. **Confirmed Present**: **T** is in the word, but not in position 3 (so it must be in position 1, 4, or 5).
3. **Absent Letters**: C, R, N, E, P, I, O (cannot be used).
4. **Goal**: Test new common letters (e.g., S, L, H, Y) and verify T's position.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Use a word that:
  - Keeps **A** in position 2.
  - Places **T** in an untested position (position 4) to check if it belongs there.
  - Tests new high-frequency letters (H, S, Y) in unused positions.
  - Avoids all excluded letters.

**Chosen word: HASTY**  
- **H** (position 1): Tests a new consonant.  
- **A** (position 2): Confirmed correct (✓).  
- **S** (position 3): Tests a common letter in an open slot.  
- **T** (position 4): Tests T in a new position (previously tried in position 3).  
- **Y** (position 5): Tests a less common letter.  

This guess efficiently narrows down possibilities for T while maximizing new letter coverage.

<guess>hasty</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: patio -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) T(-) I(x) O(x)
Guess 3: hasty -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) S(x) T(-) Y(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the third guess ""hasty"":
 H: x -> not in the word
 A: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (second letter, as we already knew)
 S: x -> not in the word
 T: - -> in the word but wrong position (so T is present, but not in the fourth position)
 Y: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (fifth letter)

 So, we now know:
 - The second letter is A (position 2) and the fifth letter is Y (position 5). So the word pattern is: _ A _ _ Y
 - The letter T is in the word, but not in the fourth position. Since we now know the fifth letter is Y, T cannot be at position 5 either. Therefore, T must be in position 1 or 3? 
   But note: the word has positions: 1,2,3,4,5. We know:
     Position 2: A
     Position 5: Y
   We have tried T in position 3 (in ""patio"") and position 4 (in ""hasty"") and both were wrong. So T must be in position 1? Because that's the only position left? 
   However, we haven't tried position 1 for T yet.

   But wait: in ""patio"", T was at position 3 -> wrong position (but present). In ""hasty"", T was at position 4 -> wrong position (but present). So T is not at 3 or 4. And we know it's not at 2 (which is A) and not at 5 (which is Y). Therefore, the only possibility is position 1.

   Therefore, T must be the first letter.

   So the word is: T A _ _ Y

 - Also, we have new absent letters: H and S (from ""hasty""). So we add H and S to the absent list.

 Now, the absent letters are: C, R, N, E, P, I, O, H, S.

 We are missing the third and fourth letters.

 The word pattern: T A _ _ Y

 We need to fill in the two middle letters (positions 3 and 4) with letters that are not in the absent list.

 Available letters: we have to avoid: C, R, N, E, P, I, O, H, S.

 What letters are left? 
   A to Z without: C, E, H, I, N, O, P, R, S.

 Remaining: A, B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 But note: we already have T and A and Y in the word. The word is T A _ _ Y. We don't know if there are duplicate letters? But we haven't seen any duplicates so far.

 We need to choose a word that fits: T A _ _ Y

 And we want to test the two missing letters.

 We can try to form a word with the available letters.

 Common words: 
   ""TASTY"" -> but S is absent? We cannot use S. Also, T is already at the start and we don't know if we can have another T? But we haven't ruled out duplicates. However, we have T at position 1 and we are going to put T at position 3? But ""TASTY"" has T at 1 and 4? Actually: T A S T Y -> but S is absent and we have two T's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed? But the feedback hasn't shown any duplicate so far. However, we cannot use S.

   ""TABBY"" -> T A B B Y -> B is available? Yes. But we have two B's? 
   ""TABBY"" is a word. It has B at positions 3 and 4.

   But we don't know if B is in the word? We can test.

   However, we have only two positions to fill and we have two letters to test? But we can test two new letters at once? Or we can try to get as much information as possible.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that uses two different new letters.

   Example: ""TALKY"" -> T A L K Y -> L and K are available? Yes. 
   But note: we have already tried L? No, we haven't. And K is new.

   But wait: in the previous feedback, we have not tested L or K.

   However, we have only two positions: 3 and 4. So if we guess ""TALKY"", then:
      Position 3: L
      Position 4: K

   If we get feedback: 
      T: ✓ (position 1)
      A: ✓ (position 2)
      L: ? 
      K: ?
      Y: ✓ (position 5)

   Then we will know if L and K are in the word and in the correct positions.

   But note: we are not sure if the word has duplicate letters? But we don't have any duplicate in this guess.

   However, we have a constraint: we have only 3 guesses left? Actually, we are on the fourth guess (after three guesses). We have 3 more guesses? The game allows 6 guesses.

   We can also try to cover more letters? But we have two positions and we are testing two letters. That's efficient.

   But what if the word is ""TABBY""? Then we would not get it because we are using L and K.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that uses one common letter and one less common? But we don't have much information.

   How about ""TARDY""? But R is absent? We cannot use R.

   ""TANGY"": T A N G Y -> but N is absent? We cannot use N.

   ""TAMMY"": M is available? Yes, but duplicate M? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed? Also, M is available? But we haven't tested M.

   However, we are avoiding the absent letters.

   Let me list possible words that fit T A _ _ Y and use only the available letters.

   Some options:
     - ""TABBY"" (B,B)
     - ""TACKY"" (C is absent? C is in the absent list -> cannot use)
     - ""TALLY"" (L,L) -> but we don't know if duplicates are allowed? And we haven't tested L.
     - ""TALKY"" (L,K) -> valid word? Yes, meaning talkative? Slang, but acceptable.
     - ""TAMMY"" (M,M) -> a name? But might be accepted.
     - ""TANZY"" (N is absent) -> no.
     - ""TAPPY"" (P is absent) -> no.
     - ""TARZY"" (R absent) -> no.
     - ""TAWNY"" (W,N) -> N is absent -> no.
     - ""TAFFY"" (F,F) -> valid word: taffy candy.

   So we have: 
        TABBY: B and B
        TALKY: L and K
        TAMMY: M and M
        TAFFY: F and F

   And also: ""TAXPY""? Not a word.

   How about ""TALKY"" and ""TAFFY"" are the ones without duplicates? Actually, ""TALKY"" has two distinct letters? T, A, L, K, Y -> all distinct? Yes.

   But note: we have T and then L and K. We don't know if L or K are in the word.

   Alternatively, we can try ""TAFFY"": T, A, F, F, Y -> duplicate F? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The feedback so far hasn't shown duplicates, but it's possible.

   We need to choose one.

   Since we have limited guesses, we might want to test two new letters that are common? But L is more common than F? 

   However, we are not sure.

   Another idea: we can try a word that uses two different common letters? The most common letters left are: L, D, U, M, W, etc.

   How about ""DAILY""? But we have to start with T and end with Y? Our word must be T A _ _ Y.

   So we cannot use ""DAILY"".

   We must stick to the pattern.

   I think ""TALKY"" is a good choice because it tests two new letters: L and K.

   But note: if the word is ""TABBY"", then we won't get it, but we will know that L and K are absent? Then we can try ""TABBY"" next? But we have two guesses left after this? Actually, we are on the fourth guess, so we have two more after this? Total 6 guesses: we have used 3, so 3 left? Actually, we are about to make the fourth guess, then we have two more.

   Alternatively, we can try ""TAFFY"" to test F? But F is less common.

   How about ""TALLY""? T A L L Y -> duplicate L? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? If we try ""TALLY"", then we are testing L at position 3 and 4? But we get two L's? The feedback might be:

      T: ✓
      A: ✓
      L: if the word has L at position 3, then ✓, and if at position 4 then ✓? But if the word has only one L, then one of them will be absent? Or if the word has two L's? 

   But we don't know. It might be messy.

   So to avoid confusion, we can try a word with two distinct new letters.

   Therefore, I choose ""TALKY"".

   But wait: is ""TALKY"" a valid word? It is in some dictionaries as an adjective meaning talkative. We'll assume it's acceptable.

   Alternatively, we can use ""TAWNY"" but N is absent? No.

   Another word: ""TAKHY""? Not a word.

   How about ""TAMLY""? Not common.

   So I think ""TALKY"" is acceptable.

   But note: we have the letter Y at the end, which we already know is correct. So we are only testing the two middle letters.

   We'll guess ""TALKY"".

   However, let me check if there is a word that uses more common letters? 

   How about ""TALKY"" uses L and K. Another common letter is M? We can try ""TAMMY"", but that has duplicate M? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed? 

   Alternatively, ""TAMED"" -> but E is absent and we need to end with Y.

   I think ""TALKY"" is the best.

   So we guess: TALKY

<guess>talky</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**:  
  - `C` (absent), `R` (absent), `A` (present, wrong position), `N` (absent), `E` (absent).  
- **Guess 2 (PATIO)**:  
  - `P` (absent), `A` (✓ correct position), `T` (present, wrong position), `I` (absent), `O` (absent).  
- **Guess 3 (HASTY)**:  
  - `H` (absent), `A` (✓ correct position), `S` (absent), `T` (present, wrong position), `Y` (✓ correct position).  

### Key Insights:
1. **Fixed Letters**:  
   - Position 2: **A** (confirmed in both Guess 2 and 3).  
   - Position 5: **Y** (confirmed in Guess 3).  
   - The word pattern is `_ A _ _ Y`.  

2. **Confirmed Present (but Position Unknown)**:  
   - **T** is in the word but not in position 3 (from Guess 2) or position 4 (from Guess 3).  
   - Since positions 2 and 5 are fixed, **T must be in position 1** (the only remaining position).  
   - Thus, the word starts with **T**: `T A _ _ Y`.  

3. **Absent Letters**:  
   - **C, R, N, E, P, I, O, H, S** (cannot appear anywhere).  

4. **Unknown Positions**:  
   - Positions 3 and 4 need to be filled with letters not in the absent list.  
   - Available letters: **A, B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z** (and **T, A, Y** are already used but may repeat; no duplicates seen yet).  

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- **Goal**: Test plausible letters for positions 3 and 4 while adhering to the pattern `T A _ _ Y`.  
- **Chosen Word: TALKY**  
  - Tests **L** in position 3 and **K** in position 4 (both new, high-frequency consonants).  
  - Avoids all absent letters.  
  - If incorrect, feedback will confirm/reject **L** and **K**, narrowing options further.

Also, it does not contain C, R, N, or E.\n\n Since we have only one letter confirmed (A), and it\'s in the wrong position, we need to choose a new word that:\n 1. Contains the letter A in a different position (not the third).\n 2. Avoids the letters C, R, N, E.\n\n Also, we want to use this guess to test other common letters to get more information.\n\n Let\'s think about other common letters. After vowels, common consonants include T, S, L, etc.\n\n We know the secret word has 5 letters and must contain A somewhere.\n\n Possible positions for A: It could be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since it can\'t be in 3).\n\n We should choose a word that:\n - Has an A in either position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n - Does not contain C, R, N, E.\n - Includes other common letters we haven\'t tested yet, such as T, S, L, P, M, etc.\n\n Example words:\n - ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E -> but E is not allowed (we know E is out), so avoid E.\n - ""PLAIT"" has P, L, A, I, T -> but it\'s 5 letters and doesn\'t use C,R,N,E? Let\'s check: P, L, A, I, T -> all allowed? Yes.\n\n However, we don\'t know about I and T yet.\n\n Another idea: ""TASTY"" has two T\'s and A and S, but repeats T. We might not want to repeat letters to maximize information.\n\n Alternatively, ""SALAD"" has two A\'s? But we don\'t know if there are duplicate letters. It might be better to avoid duplicates unless we suspect them.\n\n Considering we have only 6 tries, we should aim to cover new letters.\n\n Let\'s choose a word that includes A and other vowels (we know E is out, so we can try I and O) and some consonants.\n\n We know E is out but other vowels: O, U, I are possible.\n\n Example: ""PAINT"" -> but N is out (from our feedback: N is x). So we cannot use N.\n\n Another: ""MAILS"" -> M, A, I, L, S -> no C,R,N,E. And positions: A is in the second position? In ""MAILS"", A is the third letter? We need to put A in a position that is not 3.\n\n We must avoid putting A in the third position because we already know it\'s not there.\n\n In ""MAILS"": M-A-I-L-S -> A is the second letter? Actually:\n Position 1: M\n Position 2: A\n Position 3: I\n Position 4: L\n Position 5: S\n\n So A is at position 2? That\'s acceptable.\n\n But wait: the feedback said A was in the word but not in the third position. It doesn\'t say it can\'t be in the third again? Actually, no: we know the secret word has exactly one A? Not necessarily, but let\'s proceed.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""PLAIT"":\n Position 1: P\n Position 2: L\n Position 3: A  -> but wait, we know A is not in the third position? \n However, the feedback only said that in the word ""crane"", the A in the third position was wrong. The secret word might have A in the third position again? Actually, no, because that A was at the same position? We are told that the letter is in the word but in the wrong position. Therefore, if we put A in the third position again, it might be the same mistake? Actually, if the secret word has A in the third position, then in our first guess we would have had a ✓ for A, but we had a \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not in the third position. Therefore, the secret word does not have A in the third position. So we should avoid putting A in the third position again.\n\n Therefore, in ""PLAIT"", A is in the third position -> same as before -> we know that the secret word doesn\'t have A in the third, so it would be inefficient to put it there again.\n\n So we must pick a word that has A in either position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\n Let\'s try to find a word that has A in position 1: \n Example: ""ADIEU"" -> but this has E (which is out) and D, I, U.\n\n Or ""AUDIO"" -> A in first, and U, D, I, O.\n\n But we avoid E? Yes, but E is out, so we can use U, D, I, O.\n\n However, we also want to test more consonants. We haven\'t tested T, S, L, etc.\n\n Another word: ""LASTS""? No, duplicate S.\n\n Alternatively: ""TALON"" -> T, A, L, O, N -> but N is out? Yes, N is not allowed.\n\n Since N is out, we cannot use words with N.\n\n With that in mind: let\'s avoid N, E, C, R.\n\n Another word: ""PATIO"" -> P, A, T, I, O \n Positions:\n  1: P\n  2: A (which is a new position -> we are testing A in second position? But we know A is somewhere, so putting it in second is acceptable)\n\n However, note that in ""crane"", A was in position 3 and we were told it\'s not there. Now in second? It might be the correct position.\n\n Alternatively: ""MANIA"" -> M, A, N, I, A -> N is out? Yes, so invalid.\n\n How about ""SOLAR"" -> S, O, L, A, R -> R is out? Yes, we cannot use R.\n\n So we must avoid R? Yes.\n\n So prohibited letters: C, R, N, E.\n\n We are allowed: A (which we must include) and any other letters except these.\n\n Common letters left: T, S, L, O, P, M, I, U, etc.\n\n Let me try to form a word that has A and four new common letters.\n\n Word: ""PASTY"" -> P, A, S, T, Y -> positions: \n  1: P\n  2: A -> but that\'s position 2? We don\'t know if position 2 is correct for A? We are trying to see if it can be at position 2.\n\n Alternatively, put A in position 4: \n Word: ""OPALS"" -> O, P, A, L, S -> but the word is OPALS? Or ""PALSY""? \n\n Actually, ""PALSY"" is a word: P, A, L, S, Y -> then A is at position 2 again? \n\n How about ""TOPAZ"": T, O, P, A, Z -> A is at position 4 -> great! \n But let me check if that is a valid English word: topaz is a gemstone -> valid.\n\n But note: we haven\'t tested S and L? But we can test others.\n\n Alternatively, ""PLASM"" -> not a word? \n\n Another one: ""QUASH"" -> Q, U, A, S, H -> A is at position 3? We cannot put A at position 3. In ""QUASH"", the A is at the fourth letter? \n Q-U-A-S-H -> positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:A, 4:S, 5:H -> oh, it\'s at 3? Avoided.\n\n How about ""DAISY""? D, A, I, S, Y -> A at position 2? But we don\'t know D? \n\n We haven\'t tested D? So it\'s okay.\n\n But note: we are avoiding E, C, R, N -> so D is allowed.\n\n However, we want to maximize the number of new letters. Also, note that we have only tested a few letters: C,R,A,N,E. So we have many letters left.\n\n I think ""DAISY"" is okay? But in the word, A is at position 2. We don\'t know about D, I, S, Y.\n\n Alternatively, let\'s use a word with A at the beginning? ""ANGRY"" -> N and R are out -> no.\n\n Another word: ""PATIO"" -> P, A, T, I, O -> which we mentioned earlier: A is at position 2? \n Positions: \n  1: P\n  2: A (this avoids position 3)\n  3: T\n  4: I\n  5: O\n\n No duplicate letters. And none of the forbidden letters.\n\n This word tests: P, A (in position 2), T, I, O.\n\n We haven\'t tested P, T, I, O yet? And A we know is present, but we are also testing if position 2 is correct.\n\n Therefore, ""PATIO"" seems like a good candidate.\n\n But note: the feedback from the first guess told us that A was in the word but not in position 3. Now we are putting it in position 2. If the secret word has A in position 2, then we\'ll get a ✓ for that A. Otherwise, if A is in another position, we\'ll get \'-\'.\n\n So let\'s go with ""PATIO"".\n\n<guess>patio</guess>Based on the previous feedback:\n- The secret word contains \'A\', but not in the third position.\n- The letters C, R, N, and E are not in the word.\n\nFor this guess, I chose ""patio"" because:\n- It includes the confirmed letter \'A\' in a new position (second slot) to test if it belongs there.\n- It introduces new common letters (P, T, I, O) that haven\'t been tested yet.\n- It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, N, E) and positions (third slot for \'A\').\n\nThis guess maximizes information gain about the secret word\'s composition.\n\n<guess>patio</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: patio -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) T(-) I(x) O(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback on the second guess ""patio"":\n P: x -> not in the word\n A: ✓ -> in the word and in the CORRECT position (so the second letter of the secret word is A)\n T: - -> in the word but in the wrong position\n I: x -> not in the word\n O: x -> not in the word\n\n Now we know:\n - The second letter of the secret word is A.

The remaining common letters include: S, L, D, U, M, B, G, Y, etc.\n\n Since we know the second letter is A, we can fix that and vary the others.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word that fits: _ A _ _ _\n\n We need to put T in position 1, 4, or 5.\n\n Option 1: T in position 1 -> T A _ _ _\n Option 2: T in position 4 -> _ A _ T _\n Option 3: T in position 5 -> _ A _ _ T\n\n We also need to fill the other positions with new letters (not in the excluded set).\n\n Let\'s think of words that fit:\n\n Option 1: T A _ _ _\n   Possible words: TABBY, TABLA, TABLE, TABOO, ... but we have constraints:\n   - Avoid E (so TABLE is out), avoid O (TABOO is out), avoid I, etc.\n\n   TABBY: T, A, B, B, Y -> has duplicate B?

We can test.\n\n   But note: we also have the letter T to place, and we are putting it at position 1. We know T is present, so if we put it at position 1 and it\'s correct, we get a ✓. If not, we get a \'-\' meaning it\'s in the word but not at position 1? But wait, we know T is present, so if it\'s not at position 1, then it must be at 4 or 5.\n\n   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has T in a position we are unsure about (like 4 or 5) to test.\n\n   Since we have limited guesses, we should try to cover as many new letters as possible.\n\n   How about ""TALKS""?

If not, we get a \'-\' and then we know T must be at 4 or 5.\n\n   However, we also have the feedback from the T in the previous guess: in ""patio"", T was at position 3 and we got a \'-\'. So T is not at position 3. But we are now trying position 1? That\'s fine.\n\n   But wait: what if the secret word has two T\'s? We don\'t know. So we can try.\n\n   However, ""TALKS"" has T at 1 and then no other T. So if the secret word has only one T, then if we get a ✓ for T at 1, then we know it\'s correct. If we get a \'-\', then we know T is at 4 or 5.\n\n   But we also have to consider that the secret word might have two T\'s? It\'s possible, but we don\'t have evidence. We\'ll assume one for now.\n\n   Alternatively, we can avoid putting T in the first position and instead put it in a position we haven\'t tried (like 4 or 5) to see if it belongs there.\n\n   We have tried T in position 3 (in ""patio"") and got a \'-\'. We haven\'t tried position 1, 4, or 5.\n\n   To maximize information, we might want to test T in a new position that we haven\'t tried, and also test other letters.\n\n   Let me think of words with T in position 4: _ A _ T _\n     Example: ""GASTS"" -> duplicate S? \n     Or ""BASTS"" -> duplicate S? \n     How about ""DAWTS""? D, A, W, T, S -> but we don\'t know D, W, S.\n\n   Or with T in position 5: _ A _ _ T\n     Example: ""FEAST"" -> but E is out. \n     ""BLAST"" -> but L, S, T: but we don\'t know if L and S are in? But B is new. However, we have to avoid E? ""BLAST"" has no E? B, L, A, S, T -> but A is at position 3? We need A at position 2. So we cannot use ""BLAST"" because the A is at position 3? Actually, in ""BLAST"": \n        Position 1: B\n        Position 2: L -> not A? But we need the second letter to be A. So we must have the pattern: _ A _ _ T\n\n     So the word must have the second letter A and the last letter T? \n        Example: ""HAVAT""? Not a word.\n        ""BEAUT"" -> not a word? \n        ""DAVIT"" -> D, A, V, I, T -> but I is out? We cannot use I.\n\n     Since I is out, we cannot use words with I.\n\n     Another: ""YEAST"" -> E is out.\n\n     How about ""MAKUT""? Not a word.\n\n     This is difficult. Let me think of common words: \n        ""EXACT"" -> E and C are out.\n\n     Maybe we should avoid position 5 for now.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try T in position 4: _ A _ T _\n     Words: ""FASTS"" -> duplicate S? \n            ""GAMUT"" -> G, A, M, U, T -> but then the T is at position 5? \n            We need T at position 4: so the word must be _ A _ T _\n            Example: ""BAITH"" -> not common? \n            ""WAIFT"" -> not a word.\n\n     How about ""HASTY"": H, A, S, T, Y -> \n        Position 1: H\n        Position 2: A (correct)\n        Position 3: S\n        Position 4: T\n        Position 5: Y\n\n     This fits: _ A _ T _ -> H A S T Y\n\n     And it uses H, S, T, Y. We know T is present, and we are testing it at position 4. Also, H, S, Y are new.\n\n     The word ""HASTY"" is valid.\n\n     But note: we are avoiding? H, S, T, Y are not in the excluded list (excluded: C,R,N,E,P,I,O). So it\'s okay.\n\n     Also, we are testing S at position 3 and Y at position 5.\n\n   Another option: ""PASTA"" -> but P is out? We cannot use P.\n\n   So ""HASTY"" seems good.\n\n   But wait, we also have the feedback that T is not in position 3. In ""HASTY"", we are putting T at position 4. That\'s a new position, so we can test.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try T in position 1: ""TABBY"", ""TACKY"" (but C is out), ""TALKY"" (K and Y), ""TANSY"" (N is out), ""TAPAS"" (P is out). So ""TALKY"" is possible? T, A, L, K, Y -> but we don\'t know L, K, Y.\n\n   However, we already have a candidate: ""HASTY"".\n\n   Let me compare:\n     ""TALKY"": tests T at position 1, A at 2 (correct), L at 3, K at 4, Y at 5.\n     ""HASTY"": tests H at 1, A at 2 (correct), S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5.\n\n   Both are valid. But note that in ""TALKY"", we are testing T at position 1. We know T is in the word, so if we put it at position 1 and it\'s correct, we get a ✓. If not, we get a \'-\' meaning T is in the word but not at 1 (so it must be at 4 or 5). \n\n   Similarly, in ""HASTY"", we are testing T at position 4. If it\'s correct, we get a ✓. If not, we get a \'-\' meaning T is in the word but not at 4 (so it must be at 1 or 5).\n\n   We also get information about the other letters.\n\n   Since we have only 4 guesses left (after this one), we want to maximize the chance of getting more information.\n\n   The word ""HASTY"" has the advantage that it tests two common letters: S and H, and also Y.\n\n   But note: we already know that the third position is not T (from the previous feedback). So in ""HASTY"", we are testing S at the third position. That might be useful.\n\n   I think ""HASTY"" is a good choice.\n\n   However, let me check if there is a word that tests more vowels? We haven\'t tested U? But we don\'t have any indication of vowels other than A. We know E and I and O are out? From the feedback, we have excluded E, I, O. So the only vowel left is U? And sometimes Y.\n\n   We might consider including U? But we don\'t have to.\n\n   I\'ll go with ""HASTY"".\n\n   So the guess is: HASTY\n\n   But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""HASTY"" is a valid English word.\n\n   Therefore, we guess ""HASTY"".\n\n<guess>hasty</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: A is in the word but not in position 3. C, R, N, E are absent.\n- **Guess 2 (PATIO)**: A is correct and in position 2. T is in the word but not in position 3. P, I, O are absent.\n\n### Key Insights:\n1. **Fixed Position**: The second letter is **A** (so the word pattern is `_ A _ _ _`).\n2. **Confirmed Present**: **T** is in the word, but not in position 3 (so it must be in position 1, 4, or 5).\n3. **Absent Letters**: C, R, N, E, P, I, O (cannot be used).\n4. **Goal**: Test new common letters (e.g., S, L, H, Y) and verify T\'s position.\n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- Use a word that:\n  - Keeps **A** in position 2.\n  - Places **T** in an untested position (position 4) to check if it belongs there.\n  - Tests new high-frequency letters (H, S, Y) in unused positions.\n  - Avoids all excluded letters.\n\n**Chosen word: HASTY**  \n- **H** (position 1): Tests a new consonant.  \n- **A** (position 2): Confirmed correct (✓).  \n- **S** (position 3): Tests a common letter in an open slot.  \n- **T** (position 4): Tests T in a new position (previously tried in position 3).  \n- **Y** (position 5): Tests a less common letter.  \n\nThis guess efficiently narrows down possibilities for T while maximizing new letter coverage.\n\n<guess>hasty</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: patio -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) T(-) I(x) O(x)\nGuess 3: hasty -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) S(x) T(-) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback on the third guess ""hasty"":\n H: x -> not in the word\n A: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (second letter, as we already knew)\n S: x -> not in the word\n T: - -> in the word but wrong position (so T is present, but not in the fourth position)\n Y: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (fifth letter)\n\n So, we now know:\n - The second letter is A (position 2) and the fifth letter is Y (position 5). So the word pattern is: _ A _ _ Y\n - The letter T is in the word, but not in the fourth position. Since we now know the fifth letter is Y, T cannot be at position 5 either. Therefore, T must be in position 1 or 3? \n   But note: the word has positions: 1,2,3,4,5. We know:\n     Position 2: A\n     Position 5: Y\n   We have tried T in position 3 (in ""patio"") and position 4 (in ""hasty"") and both were wrong. So T must be in position 1? Because that\'s the only position left? \n   However, we haven\'t tried position 1 for T yet.\n\n   But wait: in ""patio"", T was at position 3 -> wrong position (but present). In ""hasty"", T was at position 4 -> wrong position (but present). So T is not at 3 or 4. And we know it\'s not at 2 (which is A) and not at 5 (which is Y). Therefore, the only possibility is position 1.\n\n   Therefore, T must be the first letter.\n\n   So the word is: T A _ _ Y\n\n - Also, we have new absent letters: H and S (from ""hasty""). So we add H and S to the absent list.\n\n Now, the absent letters are: C, R, N, E, P, I, O, H, S.\n\n We are missing the third and fourth letters.\n\n The word pattern: T A _ _ Y\n\n We need to fill in the two middle letters (positions 3 and 4) with letters that are not in the absent list.\n\n Available letters: we have to avoid: C, R, N, E, P, I, O, H, S.\n\n What letters are left? \n   A to Z without: C, E, H, I, N, O, P, R, S.\n\n Remaining: A, B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n But note: we already have T and A and Y in the word. The word is T A _ _ Y. We don\'t know if there are duplicate letters? But we haven\'t seen any duplicates so far.\n\n We need to choose a word that fits: T A _ _ Y\n\n And we want to test the two missing letters.\n\n We can try to form a word with the available letters.\n\n Common words: \n   ""TASTY"" -> but S is absent? We cannot use S. Also, T is already at the start and we don\'t know if we can have another T? But we haven\'t ruled out duplicates. However, we have T at position 1 and we are going to put T at position 3? But ""TASTY"" has T at 1 and 4? Actually: T A S T Y -> but S is absent and we have two T\'s? We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? But the feedback hasn\'t shown any duplicate so far. However, we cannot use S.\n\n   ""TABBY"" -> T A B B Y -> B is available? Yes. But we have two B\'s? \n   ""TABBY"" is a word. It has B at positions 3 and 4.\n\n   But we don\'t know if B is in the word? We can test.\n\n   However, we have only two positions to fill and we have two letters to test? But we can test two new letters at once? Or we can try to get as much information as possible.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try a word that uses two different new letters.\n\n   Example: ""TALKY"" -> T A L K Y -> L and K are available? Yes. \n   But note: we have already tried L? No, we haven\'t. And K is new.\n\n   But wait: in the previous feedback, we have not tested L or K.\n\n   However, we have only two positions: 3 and 4. So if we guess ""TALKY"", then:\n      Position 3: L\n      Position 4: K\n\n   If we get feedback: \n      T: ✓ (position 1)\n      A: ✓ (position 2)\n      L: ? \n      K: ?\n      Y: ✓ (position 5)\n\n   Then we will know if L and K are in the word and in the correct positions.\n\n   But note: we are not sure if the word has duplicate letters? But we don\'t have any duplicate in this guess.\n\n   However, we have a constraint: we have only 3 guesses left? Actually, we are on the fourth guess (after three guesses). We have 3 more guesses? The game allows 6 guesses.\n\n   We can also try to cover more letters? But we have two positions and we are testing two letters. That\'s efficient.\n\n   But what if the word is ""TABBY""? Then we would not get it because we are using L and K.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try a word that uses one common letter and one less common? But we don\'t have much information.\n\n   How about ""TARDY""? But R is absent? We cannot use R.\n\n   ""TANGY"": T A N G Y -> but N is absent? We cannot use N.\n\n   ""TAMMY"": M is available? Yes, but duplicate M? And we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? Also, M is available? But we haven\'t tested M.\n\n   However, we are avoiding the absent letters.\n\n   Let me list possible words that fit T A _ _ Y and use only the available letters.\n\n   Some options:\n     - ""TABBY"" (B,B)\n     - ""TACKY"" (C is absent? C is in the absent list -> cannot use)\n     - ""TALLY"" (L,L) -> but we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? And we haven\'t tested L.\n     - ""TALKY"" (L,K) -> valid word? Yes, meaning talkative? Slang, but acceptable.\n     - ""TAMMY"" (M,M) -> a name? But might be accepted.\n     - ""TANZY"" (N is absent) -> no.\n     - ""TAPPY"" (P is absent) -> no.\n     - ""TARZY"" (R absent) -> no.\n     - ""TAWNY"" (W,N) -> N is absent -> no.\n     - ""TAFFY"" (F,F) -> valid word: taffy candy.\n\n   So we have: \n        TABBY: B and B\n        TALKY: L and K\n        TAMMY: M and M\n        TAFFY: F and F\n\n   And also: ""TAXPY""? Not a word.\n\n   How about ""TALKY"" and ""TAFFY"" are the ones without duplicates? Actually, ""TALKY"" has two distinct letters? T, A, L, K, Y -> all distinct? Yes.\n\n   But note: we have T and then L and K. We don\'t know if L or K are in the word.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try ""TAFFY"": T, A, F, F, Y -> duplicate F? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? The feedback so far hasn\'t shown duplicates, but it\'s possible.\n\n   We need to choose one.\n\n   Since we have limited guesses, we might want to test two new letters that are common? But L is more common than F? \n\n   However, we are not sure.\n\n   Another idea: we can try a word that uses two different common letters? The most common letters left are: L, D, U, M, W, etc.\n\n   How about ""DAILY""? But we have to start with T and end with Y? Our word must be T A _ _ Y.\n\n   So we cannot use ""DAILY"".\n\n   We must stick to the pattern.\n\n   I think ""TALKY"" is a good choice because it tests two new letters: L and K.\n\n   But note: if the word is ""TABBY"", then we won\'t get it, but we will know that L and K are absent? Then we can try ""TABBY"" next? But we have two guesses left after this? Actually, we are on the fourth guess, so we have two more after this? Total 6 guesses: we have used 3, so 3 left? Actually, we are about to make the fourth guess, then we have two more.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try ""TAFFY"" to test F? But F is less common.\n\n   How about ""TALLY""? T A L L Y -> duplicate L? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? If we try ""TALLY"", then we are testing L at position 3 and 4? But we get two L\'s? The feedback might be:\n\n      T: ✓\n      A: ✓\n      L: if the word has L at position 3, then ✓, and if at position 4 then ✓? But if the word has only one L, then one of them will be absent? Or if the word has two L\'s? \n\n   But we don\'t know. It might be messy.\n\n   So to avoid confusion, we can try a word with two distinct new letters.\n\n   Therefore, I choose ""TALKY"".\n\n   But wait: is ""TALKY"" a valid word? It is in some dictionaries as an adjective meaning talkative. We\'ll assume it\'s acceptable.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use ""TAWNY"" but N is absent? No.\n\n   Another word: ""TAKHY""? Not a word.\n\n   How about ""TAMLY""? Not common.\n\n   So I think ""TALKY"" is acceptable.\n\n   But note: we have the letter Y at the end, which we already know is correct. So we are only testing the two middle letters.\n\n   We\'ll guess ""TALKY"".\n\n   However, let me check if there is a word that uses more common letters? \n\n   How about ""TALKY"" uses L and K. Another common letter is M? We can try ""TAMMY"", but that has duplicate M? And we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? \n\n   Alternatively, ""TAMED"" -> but E is absent and we need to end with Y.\n\n   I think ""TALKY"" is the best.\n\n   So we guess: TALKY\n\n<guess>talky</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**:  \n  - `C` (absent), `R` (absent), `A` (present, wrong position), `N` (absent), `E` (absent).  \n- **Guess 2 (PATIO)**:  \n  - `P` (absent), `A` (✓ correct position), `T` (present, wrong position), `I` (absent), `O` (absent).  \n- **Guess 3 (HASTY)**:  \n  - `H` (absent), `A` (✓ correct position), `S` (absent), `T` (present, wrong position), `Y` (✓ correct position).  \n\n### Key Insights:\n1. **Fixed Letters**:  \n   - Position 2: **A** (confirmed in both Guess 2 and 3).  \n   - Position 5: **Y** (confirmed in Guess 3).  \n   - The word pattern is `_ A _ _ Y`.  \n\n2. **Confirmed Present (but Position Unknown)**:  \n   - **T** is in the word but not in position 3 (from Guess 2) or position 4 (from Guess 3).  \n   - Since positions 2 and 5 are fixed, **T must be in position 1** (the only remaining position).  \n   - Thus, the word starts with **T**: `T A _ _ Y`.  \n\n3. **Absent Letters**:  \n   - **C, R, N, E, P, I, O, H, S** (cannot appear anywhere).  \n\n4. **Unknown Positions**:  \n   - Positions 3 and 4 need to be filled with letters not in the absent list.  \n   - Available letters: **A, B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z** (and **T, A, Y** are already used but may repeat; no duplicates seen yet).  \n\n### Strategy for Guess 4:\n- **Goal**: Test plausible letters for positions 3 and 4 while adhering to the pattern `T A _ _ Y`.  \n- **Chosen Word: TALKY**  \n  - Tests **L** in position 3 and **K** in position 4 (both new, high-frequency consonants).  \n  - Avoids all absent letters.  \n  - If incorrect, feedback will confirm/reject **L** and **K**, narrowing options further.\n\n<guess>talky</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: patio -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) T(-) I(x) O(x)\nGuess 3: hasty -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) S(x) T(-) Y(✓)\nGuess 4: talky -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) A(✓) L(x) K(x) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback on the fourth guess ""talky"":
 T: ✓ -> correct position (first letter, as we deduced)
 A: ✓ -> correct position (second letter)
 L: x -> not in the word
 K: x -> not in the word
 Y: ✓ -> correct position (fifth letter)

 So, we now know:
 - The word is T A _ _ Y
 - The letters L and K are not in the word.

 We add L and K to the absent list.

 Now, absent letters: C, R, N, E, P, I, O, H, S, L, K.

 We need to fill the third and fourth positions with letters that are not in the absent list.

 Available letters: A to Z without: C, E, H, I, K, L, N, O, P, R, S.

 Remaining: A, B, D, F, G, J, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 But note: we already have T, A, and Y in the word. We don't know if duplicates are allowed? But we haven't seen any duplicates so far, so we might avoid them for now? However, we cannot rule out duplicates.

 The word pattern: T A _ _ Y

 We need to choose a word that fits this pattern and uses the available letters.

 Possible words:
   - ""TABBY"": T A B B Y -> uses B (which is available) and has duplicate B? 
   - ""TAFFY"": T A F F Y -> uses F (available) and duplicate F?
   - ""TAMMY"": T A M M Y -> uses M (available) and duplicate M?
   - ""TAWNY"": but N is absent -> no.
   - ""TASTY"": S is absent -> no.
   - ""TARDY"": R is absent -> no.
   - ""TANGY"": N is absent -> no.

 Also, words without duplicates? 
   - ""TABBY"" has duplicates, ""TAFFY"" has duplicates, ""TAMMY"" has duplicates.
   - ""TAFFY"" is a word: T A F F Y -> positions 3 and 4 are both F.

   But are there words without duplicates? 
     ""TABBY"" has two B's -> duplicate.
     ""TAFFY"" has two F's -> duplicate.
     ""TAMMY"" has two M's -> duplicate.

   How about ""TAWPY""? Not a word.

   ""TAWDY""? Not a word.

   ""TAXMY""? Not a word.

   ""TAVY""? Not 5 letters.

   ""TAWGY""? Not a word.

   ""TAJMY""? Not a word.

   ""TAFFY"" and ""TABBY"" are common words.

   But note: we have not tested F or B or M.

   We can try ""TAFFY"" to test F? Or ""TABBY"" to test B? Or ""TAMMY"" to test M?

   Since we have two positions to fill and we are using the same letter twice, we are effectively testing only one new letter per guess? But that's less efficient? However, we have only two guesses left (after this one) and we are trying to find the exact word.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that uses two different letters? But we don't know any words that fit T A _ _ Y with two different available letters? 

   Let me think: 
        T A B _ Y -> what can be in the fourth position? If we use B in third, then the fourth must be a letter that forms a word with T A B _ Y. 
        Words: ""TABBY"" (with B in fourth) -> duplicate.
               ""TABBY"" is the only common one.

        Similarly, T A F _ Y -> ""TAFFY"" (with F in fourth) -> duplicate.

        T A M _ Y -> ""TAMMY"" (with M in fourth) -> duplicate.

        T A D _ Y -> ""DADDY""? No, that's D A D D Y -> not starting with T.
        T A G _ Y -> ""TAGGY""? Not a word.
        T A J _ Y -> ""TAJJY""? No.
        T A V _ Y -> ""TAVVY""? Not a word.
        T A W _ Y -> ""TAWNY"" -> but N is absent -> no.
        T A X _ Y -> ""TAXOLY""? No.

   So it seems the only common words are the ones with duplicates: ""TABBY"", ""TAFFY"", ""TAMMY"".

   We have to choose one.

   We can start with the most common? ""TABBY"" is a word meaning a type of cat or an inexperienced person? It's valid.

   ""TAFFY"" is a candy.

   ""TAMMY"" is a fabric or a name.

   We'll try ""TABBY"" first.

   So the guess is: TABBY

   But note: we are testing B. If we get feedback that B is present but in the wrong positions? Or if we get two ✓ for the two B's? 

   We'll see.

   Alternatively, we can try ""TAFFY"" to test F? But we don't have a preference.

   I'll go with ""TABBY"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**:  
  - `C` (absent), `R` (absent), `A` (present, wrong position), `N` (absent), `E` (absent).  
- **Guess 2 (PATIO)**:  
  - `P` (absent), `A` (✓ correct position), `T` (present, wrong position), `I` (absent), `O` (absent).  
- **Guess 3 (HASTY)**:  
  - `H` (absent), `A` (✓ correct position), `S` (absent), `T` (present, wrong position), `Y` (✓ correct position).  
- **Guess 4 (TALKY)**:  
  - `T` (✓ correct position), `A` (✓ correct position), `L` (absent), `K` (absent), `Y` (✓ correct position).  

### Key Insights:
1. **Fixed Letters**:  
   - Position 1: **T** (confirmed ✓).  
   - Position 2: **A** (confirmed ✓).  
   - Position 5: **Y** (confirmed ✓).  
   - The word pattern is **`T A _ _ Y`**.  

2. **Absent Letters**:  
   - **C, R, N, E, P, I, O, H, S, L, K** (cannot appear).  

3. **Unknown Positions**:  
   - Positions 3 and 4 must be filled with letters **not** in the absent list.  
   - Available letters: **B, D, F, G, J, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z** (and potential duplicates of **T, A, Y**—though unlikely).  

### Strategy for Guess 5:
- **Goal**: Test plausible letters for positions 3 and 4.  
- Given the pattern `T A _ _ Y`, common words include:  
  - `TABBY` (uses `B`), `TAFFY` (uses `F`), `TAMMY` (uses `M`).  
- **Chosen Word: TABBY**  
  - Tests `B` in positions 3 and 4 (if `B` is correct, feedback will reveal if positions/duplicates are valid).  
  - Avoids all absent letters.  

<guess>tabby</guess>",tabby,"We are given feedback on the fourth guess ""talky"":
 T: ✓ -> correct position (first letter, as we deduced)
 A: ✓ -> correct position (second letter)
 L: x -> not in the word
 K: x -> not in the word
 Y: ✓ -> correct position (fifth letter)

 So, we now know:
 - The word is T A _ _ Y
 - The letters L and K are not in the word.

 We add L and K to the absent list.

 Now, absent letters: C, R, N, E, P, I, O, H, S, L, K.

 We need to fill the third and fourth positions with letters that are not in the absent list.

 Available letters: A to Z without: C, E, H, I, K, L, N, O, P, R, S.

 Remaining: A, B, D, F, G, J, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 But note: we already have T, A, and Y in the word. We don't know if duplicates are allowed? But we haven't seen any duplicates so far, so we might avoid them for now? However, we cannot rule out duplicates.

 The word pattern: T A _ _ Y

 We need to choose a word that fits this pattern and uses the available letters.

 Possible words:
   - ""TABBY"": T A B B Y -> uses B (which is available) and has duplicate B? 
   - ""TAFFY"": T A F F Y -> uses F (available) and duplicate F?
   - ""TAMMY"": T A M M Y -> uses M (available) and duplicate M?
   - ""TAWNY"": but N is absent -> no.
   - ""TASTY"": S is absent -> no.
   - ""TARDY"": R is absent -> no.
   - ""TANGY"": N is absent -> no.

 Also, words without duplicates? 
   - ""TABBY"" has duplicates, ""TAFFY"" has duplicates, ""TAMMY"" has duplicates.
   - ""TAFFY"" is a word: T A F F Y -> positions 3 and 4 are both F.

   But are there words without duplicates? 
     ""TABBY"" has two B's -> duplicate.
     ""TAFFY"" has two F's -> duplicate.
     ""TAMMY"" has two M's -> duplicate.

   How about ""TAWPY""? Not a word.

   ""TAWDY""? Not a word.

   ""TAXMY""? Not a word.

   ""TAVY""? Not 5 letters.

   ""TAWGY""? Not a word.

   ""TAJMY""? Not a word.

   ""TAFFY"" and ""TABBY"" are common words.

   But note: we have not tested F or B or M.

   We can try ""TAFFY"" to test F? Or ""TABBY"" to test B? Or ""TAMMY"" to test M?

   Since we have two positions to fill and we are using the same letter twice, we are effectively testing only one new letter per guess? But that's less efficient? However, we have only two guesses left (after this one) and we are trying to find the exact word.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that uses two different letters? But we don't know any words that fit T A _ _ Y with two different available letters? 

   Let me think: 
        T A B _ Y -> what can be in the fourth position? If we use B in third, then the fourth must be a letter that forms a word with T A B _ Y. 
        Words: ""TABBY"" (with B in fourth) -> duplicate.
               ""TABBY"" is the only common one.

        Similarly, T A F _ Y -> ""TAFFY"" (with F in fourth) -> duplicate.

        T A M _ Y -> ""TAMMY"" (with M in fourth) -> duplicate.

        T A D _ Y -> ""DADDY""? No, that's D A D D Y -> not starting with T.
        T A G _ Y -> ""TAGGY""? Not a word.
        T A J _ Y -> ""TAJJY""? No.
        T A V _ Y -> ""TAVVY""? Not a word.
        T A W _ Y -> ""TAWNY"" -> but N is absent -> no.
        T A X _ Y -> ""TAXOLY""? No.

   So it seems the only common words are the ones with duplicates: ""TABBY"", ""TAFFY"", ""TAMMY"".

   We have to choose one.

   We can start with the most common? ""TABBY"" is a word meaning a type of cat or an inexperienced person? It's valid.

   ""TAFFY"" is a candy.

   ""TAMMY"" is a fabric or a name.

   We'll try ""TABBY"" first.

   So the guess is: TABBY

   But note: we are testing B. If we get feedback that B is present but in the wrong positions? Or if we get two ✓ for the two B's? 

   We'll see.

   Alternatively, we can try ""TAFFY"" to test F? But we don't have a preference.

   I'll go with ""TABBY"".

<guess>tabby</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**:  
  - `C` (absent), `R` (absent), `A` (present, wrong position), `N` (absent), `E` (absent).  
- **Guess 2 (PATIO)**:  
  - `P` (absent), `A` (✓ correct position), `T` (present, wrong position), `I` (absent), `O` (absent).  
- **Guess 3 (HASTY)**:  
  - `H` (absent), `A` (✓ correct position), `S` (absent), `T` (present, wrong position), `Y` (✓ correct position).  
- **Guess 4 (TALKY)**:  
  - `T` (✓ correct position), `A` (✓ correct position), `L` (absent), `K` (absent), `Y` (✓ correct position).  

### Key Insights:
1. **Fixed Letters**:  
   - Position 1: **T** (confirmed ✓).  
   - Position 2: **A** (confirmed ✓).  
   - Position 5: **Y** (confirmed ✓).  
   - The word pattern is **`T A _ _ Y`**.  

2. **Absent Letters**:  
   - **C, R, N, E, P, I, O, H, S, L, K** (cannot appear).  

3. **Unknown Positions**:  
   - Positions 3 and 4 must be filled with letters **not** in the absent list.  
   - Available letters: **B, D, F, G, J, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z** (and potential duplicates of **T, A, Y**—though unlikely).  

### Strategy for Guess 5:
- **Goal**: Test plausible letters for positions 3 and 4.  
- Given the pattern `T A _ _ Y`, common words include:  
  - `TABBY` (uses `B`), `TAFFY` (uses `F`), `TAMMY` (uses `M`).  
- **Chosen Word: TABBY**  
  - Tests `B` in positions 3 and 4 (if `B` is correct, feedback will reveal if positions/duplicates are valid).  
  - Avoids all absent letters.",Guess 5: tabby -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) A(✓) B(✓) B(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
