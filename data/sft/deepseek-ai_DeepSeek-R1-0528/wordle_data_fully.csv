We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' — which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are on the second guess. The first guess was ""crane"" and we received feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x). This means that none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.

 Since none of these letters are in the word, we must avoid using them in our next guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain any of the letters C, R, A, N, E.

 Let's think of common vowels and consonants that we haven't tried yet. Vowels: we have used A and E, so we can try O, I, U. Consonants: many left such as S, T, L, B, D, G, H, K, M, P, etc.

 A good strategy is to pick a word that uses other common letters to get more information.

 For example, words like ""SLIMY"", ""POUND"", ""LIGHT"" might be options, but we must ensure no excluded letters.

 Let me brainstorm some words without C, R, A, N, E:

 - Using common letters: S, T, L, O, I, U, etc.

 Possible words:
   ""TOILS"" - but we want more coverage.
   ""PIOUS"" - again, let's try for more common letters.
   ""SHOUT"" - includes S, H, O, U, T -> these are common and we haven't tried them.

 Alternatively, ""SLOTH"" or ""PLUSH"".

 Another popular starting word is ""SHINE"" but E is excluded so not allowed.

 Since E is excluded, we can't use it.

 Let me find a word without C, R, A, N, E.

 Consider ""WOULD"" - but we don't have W and D, but they are less common. Better to focus on more frequent letters.

 Common letters without the excluded ones: S, T, L, O, P, I, D, G, H, U, B, K, etc.

 I think ""SPOUT"" would be a good guess: S, P, O, U, T. All common letters.

 Another option: ""BLUSH"" - B, L, U, S, H.

 We want to maximize new letter coverage.

 Let's go with ""SPOUT"": 
   S, P, O, U, T - all new, and gets us vowels O and U, and common consonants S, P, T.

 Alternatively, we can use a word that has two of a vowel to test? But that might not be efficient.

 Since it's the second guess, let's stick with all new letters.

Given that the first guess ""crane"" had all letters marked as absent (C, R, A, N, E), the secret word contains none of these letters. For my next guess, I need to choose a word with entirely different letters to maximize information. I'll prioritize common unused consonants (like S, T, L, P, D) and vowels (O, U, I).

A good candidate is **""SPOUT""**:
- Uses high-frequency letters not yet tried: S, P, O, U, T
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, E)
- Tests two vowels (O, U) and three common consonants

We are on the third guess. Previous feedback:
- Guess 1: ""crane"" -> all letters absent: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
- Guess 2: ""spout"" -> S(x), P(x), O(x), U(-), T(x)

The feedback for ""spout"" shows:
- U is present in the word but in the wrong position (since it's marked with -).
- S, P, O, T are absent.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter U, but not in the last position (since we placed U at the fourth position and it was wrong).

Also, from the first guess, we know the word has no C, R, A, N, E.

So, absent letters so far: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, O, T.

We must include U in our next guess, but not in the fourth position.

We also need to avoid the absent letters.

Now, we have to think of a 5-letter word that:
- Contains U (but not in position 4)
- Does not contain C, R, A, N, E, S, P, O, T

What letters are left? Let's list the alphabet and remove the absent ones.

Alphabet: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z

Absent: A, C, E, N, O, P, R, S, T

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But we know U is in the word, so we must use it.

We also want to use common letters to maximize information.

Common letters from the available set: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, U

We need to form a 5-letter word with these, including U (not in position 4).

Possible positions for U: 1,2,3,5 (since position 4 is wrong).

Let's think of words that fit.

Some ideas:

- Words starting with U: but we have to use available letters. Examples: UDDER (but D is available, but E and R are absent? R is absent, E is absent. So not possible). UDDER has E and R which are absent.

- Words with U in second position: e.g., GUILD (G,U,I,L,D) — all available? G, U, I, L, D are all in the available set. And no absent letters. Also, U is in position 2, which is allowed.

- Another: BUILD (B,U,I,L,D) — similar.

- U in third position: e.g., MAULS (but S is absent) — not allowed.

- U in fifth position: e.g., BAYOU — but O is absent, and A is absent. Not allowed.

So let's consider:

- GUILD: G, U, I, L, D — all available. U in position 2.
- BUILD: B, U, I, L, D — all available. U in position 2.

Both are valid words.

We could also try to include more common letters.

Another word: LUCKY — but C is absent, and we don't have C.

Or FLUID: F, L, U, I, D — all available. U in position 3.

FLUID: positions: F(1), L(2), U(3), I(4), D(5). But in ""spout"", U was in position 4 and was wrong. Now we are putting U in position 3, which is different, so that's fine.

Similarly, we could have GUID (too short), needs 5 letters.

Another: HUMID — H, U, M, I, D. U in position 2. All available.

But we don't know if H, M, etc. are in the word.

We need to choose a word that tests new letters.

Since we have limited information, we should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

Common letters available: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, U

We can try to use a word with U and four other new letters.

For example, ""BUILD"" uses B, U, I, L, D.

""GUILD"" uses G, U, I, L, D.

""FLUID"" uses F, L, U, I, D.

""HUMID"" uses H, U, M, I, D.

All are good.

But note that in ""BUILD"", ""GUILD"", and ""FLUID"", we are repeating I, L, D in multiple options. We might want to test different sets.

Since we have to include U, and we know it's not in position 4, we can try position 1,2,3, or 5.

Position 5: words ending with U? Not common in English. Like BAYOU (absent letters), so probably not.

So positions 1,2,3.

Let me pick ""FLUID"" because it has F and U, and we haven't tested F or L or D yet.

But we also haven't tested B, G, H, K, M, etc.

Another common word: ""QUICK"" — but Q and C? C is absent, and Q is not in our available? Actually, Q is available, but we have to see. ""QUICK"" has Q, U, I, C, K. But C is absent, so not allowed.

So avoid C.

""JUICE"" — J, U, I, C, E — C and E absent.

Not allowed.

So back to ""FLUID"" or ""BUILD"".

I think ""BUILD"" is a good choice because B is a common consonant.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

Alternatively, we can use ""DUTCH"" — but T is absent? T is absent from guess 2, so no.

T is absent.

So no.

Another: ""MUCUS"" — S is absent, and we have two U's? But S is absent.

Not allowed.

So let's go with ""BUILD"": B, U, I, L, D.

We place U in position 2, which is different from the previous position 4.

We test B, U, I, L, D.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Similarly, ""GUILD"" is also good.

But ""BUILD"" might be more common.

We could also consider ""HUMID"" to test H and M.

But let's choose one.

I'll go with ""BUILD"".

So the guess is ""BUILD"".

But note: in ""BUILD"", U is in position 2. We don't know if that's correct or not, but we are trying to find the position.

We have to avoid the absent letters.

Confirm: B, U, I, L, D — none of C,R,A,N,E,S,P,O,T. Good.

So <guess>build</guess>
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:
- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent. This means the secret word contains none of these letters.
- **Guess 2: spout** → Only U is present but in the wrong position (as indicated by `-`). Letters S, P, O, T are absent.

### Key Insights:
1. **U is in the secret word**, but not in the 4th position (since it was misplaced there in ""spout"").
2. **Absent letters so far**: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, O, T. These cannot appear in the secret word.
3. **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (since U is confirmed present, and others are untested).
4. **Strategy for next guess**:
   - Must include **U** (but not in the 4th position).
   - Use common unused letters (e.g., B, D, H, I, L, M) to maximize information.
   - Avoid absent letters.
   - Good candidates: Words like **BUILD** (tests B, U, I, L, D) or **HUMID** (tests H, U, M, I, D). I chose **BUILD** because it:
     - Places U in position 2 (a new position to test).
     - Uses high-frequency consonants (B, L, D) and a vowel (I).
     - Avoids rarer letters (e.g., J, Q, Z).

<guess>build</guess>",build,"We are on the third guess. Previous feedback:
- Guess 1: ""crane"" -> all letters absent: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
- Guess 2: ""spout"" -> S(x), P(x), O(x), U(-), T(x)

The feedback for ""spout"" shows:
- U is present in the word but in the wrong position (since it's marked with -).
- S, P, O, T are absent.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter U, but not in the last position (since we placed U at the fourth position and it was wrong).

Also, from the first guess, we know the word has no C, R, A, N, E.

So, absent letters so far: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, O, T.

We must include U in our next guess, but not in the fourth position.

We also need to avoid the absent letters.

Now, we have to think of a 5-letter word that:
- Contains U (but not in position 4)
- Does not contain C, R, A, N, E, S, P, O, T

What letters are left? Let's list the alphabet and remove the absent ones.

Alphabet: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z

Absent: A, C, E, N, O, P, R, S, T

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But we know U is in the word, so we must use it.

We also want to use common letters to maximize information.

Common letters from the available set: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, U

We need to form a 5-letter word with these, including U (not in position 4).

Possible positions for U: 1,2,3,5 (since position 4 is wrong).

Let's think of words that fit.

Some ideas:

- Words starting with U: but we have to use available letters. Examples: UDDER (but D is available, but E and R are absent? R is absent, E is absent. So not possible). UDDER has E and R which are absent.

- Words with U in second position: e.g., GUILD (G,U,I,L,D) — all available? G, U, I, L, D are all in the available set. And no absent letters. Also, U is in position 2, which is allowed.

- Another: BUILD (B,U,I,L,D) — similar.

- U in third position: e.g., MAULS (but S is absent) — not allowed.

- U in fifth position: e.g., BAYOU — but O is absent, and A is absent. Not allowed.

So let's consider:

- GUILD: G, U, I, L, D — all available. U in position 2.
- BUILD: B, U, I, L, D — all available. U in position 2.

Both are valid words.

We could also try to include more common letters.

Another word: LUCKY — but C is absent, and we don't have C.

Or FLUID: F, L, U, I, D — all available. U in position 3.

FLUID: positions: F(1), L(2), U(3), I(4), D(5). But in ""spout"", U was in position 4 and was wrong. Now we are putting U in position 3, which is different, so that's fine.

Similarly, we could have GUID (too short), needs 5 letters.

Another: HUMID — H, U, M, I, D. U in position 2. All available.

But we don't know if H, M, etc. are in the word.

We need to choose a word that tests new letters.

Since we have limited information, we should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

Common letters available: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, U

We can try to use a word with U and four other new letters.

For example, ""BUILD"" uses B, U, I, L, D.

""GUILD"" uses G, U, I, L, D.

""FLUID"" uses F, L, U, I, D.

""HUMID"" uses H, U, M, I, D.

All are good.

But note that in ""BUILD"", ""GUILD"", and ""FLUID"", we are repeating I, L, D in multiple options. We might want to test different sets.

Since we have to include U, and we know it's not in position 4, we can try position 1,2,3, or 5.

Position 5: words ending with U? Not common in English. Like BAYOU (absent letters), so probably not.

So positions 1,2,3.

Let me pick ""FLUID"" because it has F and U, and we haven't tested F or L or D yet.

But we also haven't tested B, G, H, K, M, etc.

Another common word: ""QUICK"" — but Q and C? C is absent, and Q is not in our available? Actually, Q is available, but we have to see. ""QUICK"" has Q, U, I, C, K. But C is absent, so not allowed.

So avoid C.

""JUICE"" — J, U, I, C, E — C and E absent.

Not allowed.

So back to ""FLUID"" or ""BUILD"".

I think ""BUILD"" is a good choice because B is a common consonant.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

Alternatively, we can use ""DUTCH"" — but T is absent? T is absent from guess 2, so no.

T is absent.

So no.

Another: ""MUCUS"" — S is absent, and we have two U's? But S is absent.

Not allowed.

So let's go with ""BUILD"": B, U, I, L, D.

We place U in position 2, which is different from the previous position 4.

We test B, U, I, L, D.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Similarly, ""GUILD"" is also good.

But ""BUILD"" might be more common.

We could also consider ""HUMID"" to test H and M.

But let's choose one.

I'll go with ""BUILD"".

So the guess is ""BUILD"".

But note: in ""BUILD"", U is in position 2. We don't know if that's correct or not, but we are trying to find the position.

We have to avoid the absent letters.

Confirm: B, U, I, L, D — none of C,R,A,N,E,S,P,O,T. Good.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' — which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are on the second guess. The first guess was ""crane"" and we received feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x). This means that none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.

 Since none of these letters are in the word, we must avoid using them in our next guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain any of the letters C, R, A, N, E.

 Let's think of common vowels and consonants that we haven't tried yet. Vowels: we have used A and E, so we can try O, I, U. Consonants: many left such as S, T, L, B, D, G, H, K, M, P, etc.

 A good strategy is to pick a word that uses other common letters to get more information.

 For example, words like ""SLIMY"", ""POUND"", ""LIGHT"" might be options, but we must ensure no excluded letters.

 Let me brainstorm some words without C, R, A, N, E:

 - Using common letters: S, T, L, O, I, U, etc.

 Possible words:
   ""TOILS"" - but we want more coverage.
   ""PIOUS"" - again, let's try for more common letters.
   ""SHOUT"" - includes S, H, O, U, T -> these are common and we haven't tried them.

 Alternatively, ""SLOTH"" or ""PLUSH"".

 Another popular starting word is ""SHINE"" but E is excluded so not allowed.

 Since E is excluded, we can't use it.

 Let me find a word without C, R, A, N, E.

 Consider ""WOULD"" - but we don't have W and D, but they are less common. Better to focus on more frequent letters.

 Common letters without the excluded ones: S, T, L, O, P, I, D, G, H, U, B, K, etc.

 I think ""SPOUT"" would be a good guess: S, P, O, U, T. All common letters.

 Another option: ""BLUSH"" - B, L, U, S, H.

 We want to maximize new letter coverage.

 Let's go with ""SPOUT"": 
   S, P, O, U, T - all new, and gets us vowels O and U, and common consonants S, P, T.

 Alternatively, we can use a word that has two of a vowel to test? But that might not be efficient.

 Since it's the second guess, let's stick with all new letters.

 Decide on ""SPOUT"".

<guess>spout</guess>Given that the first guess ""crane"" had all letters marked as absent (C, R, A, N, E), the secret word contains none of these letters. For my next guess, I need to choose a word with entirely different letters to maximize information. I'll prioritize common unused consonants (like S, T, L, P, D) and vowels (O, U, I).

A good candidate is **""SPOUT""**:
- Uses high-frequency letters not yet tried: S, P, O, U, T
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, E)
- Tests two vowels (O, U) and three common consonants

This helps probe a new set of letters efficiently.

Previous feedback:\n- Guess 1: ""crane"" -> all letters absent: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.\n- Guess 2: ""spout"" -> S(x), P(x), O(x), U(-), T(x)\n\nThe feedback for ""spout"" shows:\n- U is present in the word but in the wrong position (since it\'s marked with -).\n- S, P, O, T are absent.\n\nTherefore, the secret word contains the letter U, but not in the last position (since we placed U at the fourth position and it was wrong).\n\nAlso, from the first guess, we know the word has no C, R, A, N, E.\n\nSo, absent letters so far: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, O, T.\n\nWe must include U in our next guess, but not in the fourth position.\n\nWe also need to avoid the absent letters.\n\nNow, we have to think of a 5-letter word that:\n- Contains U (but not in position 4)\n- Does not contain C, R, A, N, E, S, P, O, T\n\nWhat letters are left?

Examples: UDDER (but D is available, but E and R are absent? R is absent, E is absent. So not possible). UDDER has E and R which are absent.\n\n- Words with U in second position: e.g., GUILD (G,U,I,L,D) — all available? G, U, I, L, D are all in the available set. And no absent letters. Also, U is in position 2, which is allowed.\n\n- Another: BUILD (B,U,I,L,D) — similar.\n\n- U in third position: e.g., MAULS (but S is absent) — not allowed.\n\n- U in fifth position: e.g., BAYOU — but O is absent, and A is absent. Not allowed.\n\nSo let\'s consider:\n\n- GUILD: G, U, I, L, D — all available. U in position 2.\n- BUILD: B, U, I, L, D — all available. U in position 2.\n\nBoth are valid words.\n\nWe could also try to include more common letters.\n\nAnother word: LUCKY — but C is absent, and we don\'t have C.\n\nOr FLUID: F, L, U, I, D — all available. U in position 3.\n\nFLUID: positions: F(1), L(2), U(3), I(4), D(5). But in ""spout"", U was in position 4 and was wrong. Now we are putting U in position 3, which is different, so that\'s fine.\n\nSimilarly, we could have GUID (too short), needs 5 letters.\n\nAnother: HUMID — H, U, M, I, D. U in position 2. All available.\n\nBut we don\'t know if H, M, etc. are in the word.\n\nWe need to choose a word that tests new letters.\n\nSince we have limited information, we should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.\n\nCommon letters available: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, U\n\nWe can try to use a word with U and four other new letters.\n\nFor example, ""BUILD"" uses B, U, I, L, D.\n\n""GUILD"" uses G, U, I, L, D.\n\n""FLUID"" uses F, L, U, I, D.\n\n""HUMID"" uses H, U, M, I, D.\n\nAll are good.\n\nBut note that in ""BUILD"", ""GUILD"", and ""FLUID"", we are repeating I, L, D in multiple options. We might want to test different sets.\n\nSince we have to include U, and we know it\'s not in position 4, we can try position 1,2,3, or 5.\n\nPosition 5: words ending with U? Not common in English. Like BAYOU (absent letters), so probably not.\n\nSo positions 1,2,3.\n\nLet me pick ""FLUID"" because it has F and U, and we haven\'t tested F or L or D yet.\n\nBut we also haven\'t tested B, G, H, K, M, etc.\n\nAnother common word: ""QUICK"" — but Q and C? C is absent, and Q is not in our available? Actually, Q is available, but we have to see. ""QUICK"" has Q, U, I, C, K. But C is absent, so not allowed.\n\nSo avoid C.\n\n""JUICE"" — J, U, I, C, E — C and E absent.\n\nNot allowed.\n\nSo back to ""FLUID"" or ""BUILD"".\n\nI think ""BUILD"" is a good choice because B is a common consonant.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we might get.\n\nAlternatively, we can use ""DUTCH"" — but T is absent? T is absent from guess 2, so no.\n\nT is absent.\n\nSo no.\n\nAnother: ""MUCUS"" — S is absent, and we have two U\'s? But S is absent.\n\nNot allowed.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""BUILD"": B, U, I, L, D.\n\nWe place U in position 2, which is different from the previous position 4.\n\nWe test B, U, I, L, D.\n\nIf we get feedback, we can narrow down.\n\nSimilarly, ""GUILD"" is also good.\n\nBut ""BUILD"" might be more common.\n\nWe could also consider ""HUMID"" to test H and M.\n\nBut let\'s choose one.\n\nI\'ll go with ""BUILD"".\n\nSo the guess is ""BUILD"".\n\nBut note: in ""BUILD"", U is in position 2. We don\'t know if that\'s correct or not, but we are trying to find the position.\n\nWe have to avoid the absent letters.\n\nConfirm: B, U, I, L, D — none of C,R,A,N,E,S,P,O,T. Good.\n\nSo <guess>build</guess>Based on the previous feedback:\n- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent. This means the secret word contains none of these letters.\n- **Guess 2: spout** → Only U is present but in the wrong position (as indicated by `-`). Letters S, P, O, T are absent.\n\n### Key Insights:\n1. **U is in the secret word**, but not in the 4th position (since it was misplaced there in ""spout"").\n2. **Absent letters so far**: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, O, T.

I chose **BUILD** because it:\n     - Places U in position 2 (a new position to test).\n     - Uses high-frequency consonants (B, L, D) and a vowel (I).\n     - Avoids rarer letters (e.g., J, Q, Z).\n\n<guess>build</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: spout -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(x) U(-) T(x)\nGuess 3: build -> FEEDBACK: B(x) U(✓) I(x) L(✓) D(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are on the fourth guess.
 Previous feedback:
 Guess 1: crane -> all absent: C,R,A,N,E not in word.
 Guess 2: spout -> S,P,O,T absent, U present but wrong position (specifically, position 4 is wrong).
 Guess 3: build -> Feedback: B(x), U(✓), I(x), L(✓), D(x)

 Now, from guess 3: 
   U is correct and in position 2 (since we placed U in position 2 and it got ✓).
   L is correct and in position 4 (since we placed L in position 4 and it got ✓).
   B, I, D are absent.

 So, secret word has:
   Second letter: U
   Fourth letter: L
   Does not contain: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,O,T,B,I,D

 We know the word has U in position 2 and L in position 4.

 Absent letters so far: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,O,T,B,I,D

 Available letters: F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z and perhaps some others, but excluding the absent ones.

 Since we have two positions fixed: 
   Position 2: U
   Position 4: L

 The word is: _ U _ L _

 We need to guess the first, third, and fifth letters.

 The absent letters include common ones, so we must use from the remaining: F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z.

 We must pick a word that fits the pattern _ U _ L _ and uses letters from the available set.

 Let's list possible words:

 Common letters left: F,G,H,K,M,V,W,X,Y,Z (J and Q less common, but possible).

 We also know that in the second guess, U was in position 4 and incorrectly placed? Actually, in ""spout"", U was in position 4 and it was marked as wrong position, meaning U is in the word but not in position 4. Now we know it's in position 2, which is consistent.

 Now, let's think of words that match _ U _ L _

 Examples:
   - FUGLE: But G? and E is absent? E is absent, so no.
   - HULLY: H,U,L,L,Y? But Y is available, but we are missing the fifth letter? Wait, pattern: position 1=H, 2=U, 3=L? But then position 3 is L? Then position 4=L? That would be H U L L Y. But we have position 4=L, but if position 3 is also L, that's two L's? But we don't know if L is repeated.

 However, in feedback from ""build"", we have L as correct at position 4, but we don't know what happened at position 3 because we placed I at position 3 which was absent. So L could be elsewhere? Actually, when we placed L at position 4 and it was correct, that does not say anything about whether L occurs elsewhere. But in our guess, we only put one L.

 But the feedback marks each letter individually. So we only marked L in position 4 as correct. Does not preclude another L.

 However, we have to consider if the word could have multiple L's.

 But we don't know for sure.

 Now, let's form a word: 
   Position 1: can be any available letter, say H, K, M, etc.
   Position 3: any available letter
   Position 5: any available letter

 And the word must be valid.

 Possible words:
   - ""HUMUS"": But U at position 2, then M? Position 3=M, then U at position 4? But we require L at position 4. HUMUS has position 4=U, but we need L. So not.
   - ""FULLY"": F,U,L,L,Y? Then positions: 1=F,2=U,3=L,4=L,5=Y. But then position 4 is L which matches. And position 3 is L. But we have to check letters: F,U,L,L,Y. But L is correct at position 4? Yes. However, in the third guess, we had only one L and it was at position 4. If there was another L, then the feedback for ""build"" would have shown it? We placed L at position 4 and got it correct. If there was another L, say at position 3, then the letter I at position 3 would be wrong (I is absent) but the L at position 3 would be unaccounted? In our guess ""build"", we did not have L at position 3, so we wouldn't know.

 However, the feedback for ""build"" says: B(x) U(✓) I(x) L(✓) D(x). So only two positions are correct: position 2 (U) and position 4 (L). The L at position 4 is the only L we placed. If there were another L in the secret word, it might be revealed if we hit it? But we didn't. So it's possible the word has two L's.

 But let's check if ""FULLY"" is allowed: Letters F,U,L,L,Y.

 Now, we need to check for absent letters: F is not absent? F hasn't been tested. U is used. L is used. Y has not been tested.

 But we must ensure the letters are not in the absent list. Absent: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,O,T,B,I,D. So F is available.

 However, ""FULLY"" would be: F(1), U(2), L(3), L(4), Y(5). But our pattern is position 4=L, which is satisfied. But position 3 is L? Then the L at position 3 is also correct? But in the secret word, if position 4 is L, then position 3 being L is another L? So when we guess ""build"", we had no L at position 3 (we had I), so the feedback only marked the L at position 4. It doesn't tell us about other positions.

 But in ""FULLY"", we would have two L's. The problem is that in our absent list, we have no reason to exclude L elsewhere.

 But let's see: if the secret word is ""FULLY"", then:
   Position 1: F (we didn't guess F before)
   Position 2: U (correct)
   Position 3: L (we guessed I at position 3 in ""build"", which is absent, so good)
   Position 4: L (we guessed L and it was correct)
   Position 5: Y (we didn't guess Y)

 So it fits.

 But is ""FULLY"" a 5-letter word? Yes.

 However, we have the feedback from guess 2: U(-) meaning U is present but not in position 4. In ""FULLY"", U is in position 2, so that's consistent.

 Now, another word: ""GULLY"": G,U,L,L,Y. Similar.

 Or ""HULKY"": H,U,L,K,Y? Then positions: 1=H,2=U,3=L,4=K? But position 4 must be L. In ""HULKY"", position 4 would be K, which is not L. So not.

 What about ""HUMBLY""? Too long.

 Or ""JUMBL"": But not common, and B is absent? Wait, B is absent? In our absent list: B,I,D are absent from guess 3. So B and D are out.

 So we cannot use B or D.

 Therefore, in our guess, we must avoid C,R,A,N,E,S,P,O,T,B,I,D.

 So let's list available: F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z

 Now, back to words:
   - ""FULLY"": F,U (fixed?), not fixed at position1, we need to use letter1 from available. So F is available. Then L: we know we can use L? No, we placed L and it was correct? Wait, L is in the word and we used it. But the feedback doesn't mark L as absent? So L is not in the absent list. Actually, absent list is only the ones marked 'x'. In guess3, L was marked ✓ so it is in the word and in correct position? But that doesn't mean it can't be used again? Actually, we should avoid using L in other positions? No, unless we know that it's not elsewhere? But we don't know. 

 The rules: we can use letters multiple times? But in feedback, when we placed L at position4 and it was ✓, that doesn't tell us about whether there is another L. Similarly, if there was an extra L we might get a '-' or ✓ if we place it correctly.

 But in this case, when we guess a word, we can repeat letters if we think there are multiple.

 However, for now, let's consider words without L in positions other than 4? Because we haven't tested other positions for L? Actually, we should test.

 To save guesses, we want to make a guess that fits the pattern and uses available letters.

 Possibilities:
   _ U _ L _

 We must fill:
   Position 1: available letter F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z
   Position 3: available letter (same set, and can be same as position1? but in word, it can be)
   Position 5: available letter.

 Now, common words:
   - ""FULLY"": F,U,L,L,Y -> position 3 is L. So we are putting L at position 3 and 4? But position 4 is fixed to L. Then position 5=Y.
   - ""GULLY"": G,U,L,L,Y
   - ""HULLY"": H,U,L,L,Y? As a word? ""Hully"" is not common. But ""HULKY"" doesn't work because position 4 must be L.

 Other words without double L? 
   For example: 
     - ""FUGLE""? but E absent and G not sure? But E absent.
     - ""JUMPS"": S absent and P absent -> not allowed.
     - ""MUMMY"": M,U,M,M,Y -> but position 4 is M, should be L -> not.

 So likely words are with L in position 3? Such as FULLY, GULLY, etc.

 But note: in the secret word, position 4 is L. So if we put L at position 3, then that L would be a different occurrence? Or the same? Actually, if the word has two L's, that's possible.

 We also know U is in position 2.

 So let's try ""FULLY"": 
   - F: not guessed before? Not absent. So okay.
   - U: known
   - L: at position 3? But we don't know if it's correct. And at position 4: L is fixed.
   - Y: not tried.

 But we need to make a guess that can be used to get more information. However, since we only have 3 guesses left, and we know two positions, we can guess such a word.

 Another word: ""HUMAN""? But A absent and N absent.

 Not.

 ""KULAK"": K,U,L,A,K -> A absent.

 Not.

 ""VULGAR"": G and A? A absent. Also, too long? Wait, must be 5 letters.

 So not.

 So possible 5-letter words: FULLY, GULLY, MULSH? Not a word.

 What about ""GAUZY""? G,A,U,Z,Y -> A absent? A is absent.

 Then ""QUERY"": Q,U,E,R,Y -> E and R absent.

 Not.

 So perhaps FULLY or GULLY.

 But also ""JUMBY""? J,U,M,B,Y -> B absent? Yes, B is absent from guess3.

 Not.

 So FULLY and GULLY are candidates.

 Let me check the word list.

 But another: ""LUCKY"": C and K? C absent, so not.

 So let me pick ""FULLY"": F,U,L,L,Y.

 But we have to check if L in position 3 is okay? Yes, because we haven't placed L at position 3 before? And we don't know if it's in the word or not at position 3? Wait, we know L is in the word at position 4, but we don't know if it exists elsewhere.

 In ""FULLY"", L is at position 3 and 4. So when we guess, we can see if it marks position 3 as present.

 But let's see: if the secret word is, say, ""GAWKY"", but that doesn't have U or L.

 Another word: ""FUNKY"": F,U,N,K,Y -> N absent.

 Not.

 So without common letters, let's try FULLY.

 Alternatively, we could guess a word that doesn't have double L to avoid putting L at position 3? Because if L is not at position 3, we might get information.

 For example, what about ""FUGUE""? F,U,G,U,E -> E absent and U repeated? But U is fixed at position 2, so position 4 must be L, so we cannot use U again? Actually, the word must have L at position 4, so any word without L at position 4 is invalid.

 So must have L at position 4.

 Therefore, the word is _ U _ L _

 So we are forced to have the pattern.

 Now, without using L in position 3? We don't have to, but what letter to use? 

 For example: 
   - ""HUFFL"": Not a word.
   - ""GUFFL"": Not a word.
   - ""MUFFY"": M,U,F,F,Y -> then position 4 must be F? But we have to put L at position 4. So no, we cannot.

 Unless we use L only at position 4.

 Then, words that have position 3 not L.

 Example: ""KUFIC"": But not common, and I absent? Guess3: I is absent. So I cannot be used.

 Words without I and D and B, etc.

 What about ""JUMPS"": but S and P absent.

 Not.

 Or ""MUSHY"": M,U,S,H,Y -> S absent (from guess2) and position 4 should be L? So not L.

 So how about words like ""HULKY"": but position 4 would be K? Not L. Can't be.

 So it must have L at position 4, and U at 2.

 Then the only words are those with _ U [something] L [last letter].

 Possibles: 
   position 3 = L? Then it's the double L pattern: fully, gully, hully (if valid), hully might mean something? Or mulls? But mulls has S absent, and also double L.

 But if we don't want double L, then we need position 3 to be a different letter that is available.

 Let me try to find words:

 Consider ""UMBEL"": but E absent and U at start? But position 1 must be set.

 Use a dictionary of 5-letter words that fit the pattern.

 One example: ""FUZIL"" — let me see: F,U,Z,I,L? But then position 4 would be I? And position 5=L? Then the pattern would be _ U _ L _? Wait:

 FUZIL: 
   position 1: F
   position 2: U
   position 3: Z
   position 4: I? 
   position 5: L

 But we need position 4 to be L. So that would not fit. That has I at position 4.

 Similarly, ""FUGAL"": has A absent and G? Position 4=A? But absent.

 So it seems difficult. Perhaps ""GUILD"" was a word, but D is absent and I is absent? In our case, I and D are absent.

 Another thought: we have not tried G, K, V, etc.

 What about ""BUGLE"": B absent and E absent.

 Not.

 ""GULPH"": G,U,L,P,H -> P absent.

 So, I think we have to consider words with L at position 3 and 4? That is, FULLY, GULLY, etc.

 Or ""CAULK"": C absent, A absent.

 Not.

 So between FULLY and GULLY, they are similar. Let's pick ""GULLY"": G,U,L,L,Y.

 Because G is a common letter.

 But we are forced to make a guess that might have double L.

 Alternatively, let me think of another word: ""NUCHA""? N absent.

 So I think we have to guess GULLY or FULLY.

 I'll pick ""GULLY"": G,U,L,L,Y.

 We'll see the feedback.

<guess>gully</guess>

But note: in ""GU L LY"", at position 4 is L, which is correct. At position 3 is L, which might be correct or not? But it's a guess.

 If the feedback comes with:
   G at position1: unknown
   U at2: ✓ (fixed)
   L at3: ? 
   L at4: ✓ (fixed)
   Y at5: ?

 And if there is only one L? No, if there are two L's.

 Given the feedback, we may get clues.

 But we have to avoid double-guessing? We have to go.

 So my guess is ""gully"".
</think>
### Analysis and Reasoning for Next Guess
The feedback from previous guesses reveals:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent → Eliminate these letters.
- **Guess 2 (spout)**: 
  - U is present but misplaced (marked `-`). S, P, O, T are absent → Eliminate these letters.
- **Guess 3 (build)**:
  - U (position 2) and L (position 4) are correct (marked `✓`).
  - B, I, D are absent → Eliminate these letters.

### Key Insights:
1. **Fixed positions in the secret word**:
   - Position 2: **U**
   - Position 4: **L**
   - Pattern: `[?] U [?] L [?]`
2. **Absent letters (cannot appear)**: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, O, T, B, I, D.
3. **Remaining available letters**: F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
4. **Constraints**:
   - The word must start/end with an available letter.
   - Position 3 must use an available letter (could be a repeated L, but caution: previous guesses haven't tested L elsewhere).

### Strategy:
- Focus on 5-letter words matching the pattern `_ U _ L _` using remaining letters.
- Prioritize high-frequency letters (e.g., F, G, H, K, M, Y) to maximize information.
- Possible candidates:
  - **FULLY**: Tests F (position 1), L (position 3), and Y (position 5). L at position 3 is plausible since L wasn't tested elsewhere.
  - **GULLY**: Tests G (position 1), L (position 3), and Y (position 5).
  - **HULLY** (less common): Tests H (position 1) and Y (position 5).
- Chose **GULLY** because:
  - Uses common letters (G, Y) not yet tested.
  - If L is present at position 3, feedback will confirm (likely, given L is at position 4).
  - Rules out alternatives like FULLY if G is absent/revealed.

<guess>gully</guess>",gully,"We are on the fourth guess.
 Previous feedback:
 Guess 1: crane -> all absent: C,R,A,N,E not in word.
 Guess 2: spout -> S,P,O,T absent, U present but wrong position (specifically, position 4 is wrong).
 Guess 3: build -> Feedback: B(x), U(✓), I(x), L(✓), D(x)

 Now, from guess 3: 
   U is correct and in position 2 (since we placed U in position 2 and it got ✓).
   L is correct and in position 4 (since we placed L in position 4 and it got ✓).
   B, I, D are absent.

 So, secret word has:
   Second letter: U
   Fourth letter: L
   Does not contain: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,O,T,B,I,D

 We know the word has U in position 2 and L in position 4.

 Absent letters so far: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,O,T,B,I,D

 Available letters: F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z and perhaps some others, but excluding the absent ones.

 Since we have two positions fixed: 
   Position 2: U
   Position 4: L

 The word is: _ U _ L _

 We need to guess the first, third, and fifth letters.

 The absent letters include common ones, so we must use from the remaining: F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z.

 We must pick a word that fits the pattern _ U _ L _ and uses letters from the available set.

 Let's list possible words:

 Common letters left: F,G,H,K,M,V,W,X,Y,Z (J and Q less common, but possible).

 We also know that in the second guess, U was in position 4 and incorrectly placed? Actually, in ""spout"", U was in position 4 and it was marked as wrong position, meaning U is in the word but not in position 4. Now we know it's in position 2, which is consistent.

 Now, let's think of words that match _ U _ L _

 Examples:
   - FUGLE: But G? and E is absent? E is absent, so no.
   - HULLY: H,U,L,L,Y? But Y is available, but we are missing the fifth letter? Wait, pattern: position 1=H, 2=U, 3=L? But then position 3 is L? Then position 4=L? That would be H U L L Y. But we have position 4=L, but if position 3 is also L, that's two L's? But we don't know if L is repeated.

 However, in feedback from ""build"", we have L as correct at position 4, but we don't know what happened at position 3 because we placed I at position 3 which was absent. So L could be elsewhere? Actually, when we placed L at position 4 and it was correct, that does not say anything about whether L occurs elsewhere. But in our guess, we only put one L.

 But the feedback marks each letter individually. So we only marked L in position 4 as correct. Does not preclude another L.

 However, we have to consider if the word could have multiple L's.

 But we don't know for sure.

 Now, let's form a word: 
   Position 1: can be any available letter, say H, K, M, etc.
   Position 3: any available letter
   Position 5: any available letter

 And the word must be valid.

 Possible words:
   - ""HUMUS"": But U at position 2, then M? Position 3=M, then U at position 4? But we require L at position 4. HUMUS has position 4=U, but we need L. So not.
   - ""FULLY"": F,U,L,L,Y? Then positions: 1=F,2=U,3=L,4=L,5=Y. But then position 4 is L which matches. And position 3 is L. But we have to check letters: F,U,L,L,Y. But L is correct at position 4? Yes. However, in the third guess, we had only one L and it was at position 4. If there was another L, then the feedback for ""build"" would have shown it? We placed L at position 4 and got it correct. If there was another L, say at position 3, then the letter I at position 3 would be wrong (I is absent) but the L at position 3 would be unaccounted? In our guess ""build"", we did not have L at position 3, so we wouldn't know.

 However, the feedback for ""build"" says: B(x) U(✓) I(x) L(✓) D(x). So only two positions are correct: position 2 (U) and position 4 (L). The L at position 4 is the only L we placed. If there were another L in the secret word, it might be revealed if we hit it? But we didn't. So it's possible the word has two L's.

 But let's check if ""FULLY"" is allowed: Letters F,U,L,L,Y.

 Now, we need to check for absent letters: F is not absent? F hasn't been tested. U is used. L is used. Y has not been tested.

 But we must ensure the letters are not in the absent list. Absent: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,O,T,B,I,D. So F is available.

 However, ""FULLY"" would be: F(1), U(2), L(3), L(4), Y(5). But our pattern is position 4=L, which is satisfied. But position 3 is L? Then the L at position 3 is also correct? But in the secret word, if position 4 is L, then position 3 being L is another L? So when we guess ""build"", we had no L at position 3 (we had I), so the feedback only marked the L at position 4. It doesn't tell us about other positions.

 But in ""FULLY"", we would have two L's. The problem is that in our absent list, we have no reason to exclude L elsewhere.

 But let's see: if the secret word is ""FULLY"", then:
   Position 1: F (we didn't guess F before)
   Position 2: U (correct)
   Position 3: L (we guessed I at position 3 in ""build"", which is absent, so good)
   Position 4: L (we guessed L and it was correct)
   Position 5: Y (we didn't guess Y)

 So it fits.

 But is ""FULLY"" a 5-letter word? Yes.

 However, we have the feedback from guess 2: U(-) meaning U is present but not in position 4. In ""FULLY"", U is in position 2, so that's consistent.

 Now, another word: ""GULLY"": G,U,L,L,Y. Similar.

 Or ""HULKY"": H,U,L,K,Y? Then positions: 1=H,2=U,3=L,4=K? But position 4 must be L. In ""HULKY"", position 4 would be K, which is not L. So not.

 What about ""HUMBLY""? Too long.

 Or ""JUMBL"": But not common, and B is absent? Wait, B is absent? In our absent list: B,I,D are absent from guess 3. So B and D are out.

 So we cannot use B or D.

 Therefore, in our guess, we must avoid C,R,A,N,E,S,P,O,T,B,I,D.

 So let's list available: F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z

 Now, back to words:
   - ""FULLY"": F,U (fixed?), not fixed at position1, we need to use letter1 from available. So F is available. Then L: we know we can use L? No, we placed L and it was correct? Wait, L is in the word and we used it. But the feedback doesn't mark L as absent? So L is not in the absent list. Actually, absent list is only the ones marked 'x'. In guess3, L was marked ✓ so it is in the word and in correct position? But that doesn't mean it can't be used again? Actually, we should avoid using L in other positions? No, unless we know that it's not elsewhere? But we don't know. 

 The rules: we can use letters multiple times? But in feedback, when we placed L at position4 and it was ✓, that doesn't tell us about whether there is another L. Similarly, if there was an extra L we might get a '-' or ✓ if we place it correctly.

 But in this case, when we guess a word, we can repeat letters if we think there are multiple.

 However, for now, let's consider words without L in positions other than 4? Because we haven't tested other positions for L? Actually, we should test.

 To save guesses, we want to make a guess that fits the pattern and uses available letters.

 Possibilities:
   _ U _ L _

 We must fill:
   Position 1: available letter F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z
   Position 3: available letter (same set, and can be same as position1? but in word, it can be)
   Position 5: available letter.

 Now, common words:
   - ""FULLY"": F,U,L,L,Y -> position 3 is L. So we are putting L at position 3 and 4? But position 4 is fixed to L. Then position 5=Y.
   - ""GULLY"": G,U,L,L,Y
   - ""HULLY"": H,U,L,L,Y? As a word? ""Hully"" is not common. But ""HULKY"" doesn't work because position 4 must be L.

 Other words without double L? 
   For example: 
     - ""FUGLE""? but E absent and G not sure? But E absent.
     - ""JUMPS"": S absent and P absent -> not allowed.
     - ""MUMMY"": M,U,M,M,Y -> but position 4 is M, should be L -> not.

 So likely words are with L in position 3? Such as FULLY, GULLY, etc.

 But note: in the secret word, position 4 is L. So if we put L at position 3, then that L would be a different occurrence? Or the same? Actually, if the word has two L's, that's possible.

 We also know U is in position 2.

 So let's try ""FULLY"": 
   - F: not guessed before? Not absent. So okay.
   - U: known
   - L: at position 3? But we don't know if it's correct. And at position 4: L is fixed.
   - Y: not tried.

 But we need to make a guess that can be used to get more information. However, since we only have 3 guesses left, and we know two positions, we can guess such a word.

 Another word: ""HUMAN""? But A absent and N absent.

 Not.

 ""KULAK"": K,U,L,A,K -> A absent.

 Not.

 ""VULGAR"": G and A? A absent. Also, too long? Wait, must be 5 letters.

 So not.

 So possible 5-letter words: FULLY, GULLY, MULSH? Not a word.

 What about ""GAUZY""? G,A,U,Z,Y -> A absent? A is absent.

 Then ""QUERY"": Q,U,E,R,Y -> E and R absent.

 Not.

 So perhaps FULLY or GULLY.

 But also ""JUMBY""? J,U,M,B,Y -> B absent? Yes, B is absent from guess3.

 Not.

 So FULLY and GULLY are candidates.

 Let me check the word list.

 But another: ""LUCKY"": C and K? C absent, so not.

 So let me pick ""FULLY"": F,U,L,L,Y.

 But we have to check if L in position 3 is okay? Yes, because we haven't placed L at position 3 before? And we don't know if it's in the word or not at position 3? Wait, we know L is in the word at position 4, but we don't know if it exists elsewhere.

 In ""FULLY"", L is at position 3 and 4. So when we guess, we can see if it marks position 3 as present.

 But let's see: if the secret word is, say, ""GAWKY"", but that doesn't have U or L.

 Another word: ""FUNKY"": F,U,N,K,Y -> N absent.

 Not.

 So without common letters, let's try FULLY.

 Alternatively, we could guess a word that doesn't have double L to avoid putting L at position 3? Because if L is not at position 3, we might get information.

 For example, what about ""FUGUE""? F,U,G,U,E -> E absent and U repeated? But U is fixed at position 2, so position 4 must be L, so we cannot use U again? Actually, the word must have L at position 4, so any word without L at position 4 is invalid.

 So must have L at position 4.

 Therefore, the word is _ U _ L _

 So we are forced to have the pattern.

 Now, without using L in position 3? We don't have to, but what letter to use? 

 For example: 
   - ""HUFFL"": Not a word.
   - ""GUFFL"": Not a word.
   - ""MUFFY"": M,U,F,F,Y -> then position 4 must be F? But we have to put L at position 4. So no, we cannot.

 Unless we use L only at position 4.

 Then, words that have position 3 not L.

 Example: ""KUFIC"": But not common, and I absent? Guess3: I is absent. So I cannot be used.

 Words without I and D and B, etc.

 What about ""JUMPS"": but S and P absent.

 Not.

 Or ""MUSHY"": M,U,S,H,Y -> S absent (from guess2) and position 4 should be L? So not L.

 So how about words like ""HULKY"": but position 4 would be K? Not L. Can't be.

 So it must have L at position 4, and U at 2.

 Then the only words are those with _ U [something] L [last letter].

 Possibles: 
   position 3 = L? Then it's the double L pattern: fully, gully, hully (if valid), hully might mean something? Or mulls? But mulls has S absent, and also double L.

 But if we don't want double L, then we need position 3 to be a different letter that is available.

 Let me try to find words:

 Consider ""UMBEL"": but E absent and U at start? But position 1 must be set.

 Use a dictionary of 5-letter words that fit the pattern.

 One example: ""FUZIL"" — let me see: F,U,Z,I,L? But then position 4 would be I? And position 5=L? Then the pattern would be _ U _ L _? Wait:

 FUZIL: 
   position 1: F
   position 2: U
   position 3: Z
   position 4: I? 
   position 5: L

 But we need position 4 to be L. So that would not fit. That has I at position 4.

 Similarly, ""FUGAL"": has A absent and G? Position 4=A? But absent.

 So it seems difficult. Perhaps ""GUILD"" was a word, but D is absent and I is absent? In our case, I and D are absent.

 Another thought: we have not tried G, K, V, etc.

 What about ""BUGLE"": B absent and E absent.

 Not.

 ""GULPH"": G,U,L,P,H -> P absent.

 So, I think we have to consider words with L at position 3 and 4? That is, FULLY, GULLY, etc.

 Or ""CAULK"": C absent, A absent.

 Not.

 So between FULLY and GULLY, they are similar. Let's pick ""GULLY"": G,U,L,L,Y.

 Because G is a common letter.

 But we are forced to make a guess that might have double L.

 Alternatively, let me think of another word: ""NUCHA""? N absent.

 So I think we have to guess GULLY or FULLY.

 I'll pick ""GULLY"": G,U,L,L,Y.

 We'll see the feedback.

<guess>gully</guess>

But note: in ""GU L LY"", at position 4 is L, which is correct. At position 3 is L, which might be correct or not? But it's a guess.

 If the feedback comes with:
   G at position1: unknown
   U at2: ✓ (fixed)
   L at3: ? 
   L at4: ✓ (fixed)
   Y at5: ?

 And if there is only one L? No, if there are two L's.

 Given the feedback, we may get clues.

 But we have to avoid double-guessing? We have to go.

 So my guess is ""gully"".### Analysis and Reasoning for Next Guess
The feedback from previous guesses reveals:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent → Eliminate these letters.
- **Guess 2 (spout)**: 
  - U is present but misplaced (marked `-`). S, P, O, T are absent → Eliminate these letters.
- **Guess 3 (build)**:
  - U (position 2) and L (position 4) are correct (marked `✓`).
  - B, I, D are absent → Eliminate these letters.

### Key Insights:
1. **Fixed positions in the secret word**:
   - Position 2: **U**
   - Position 4: **L**
   - Pattern: `[?] U [?] L [?]`
2. **Absent letters (cannot appear)**: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, O, T, B, I, D.
3. **Remaining available letters**: F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
4. **Constraints**:
   - The word must start/end with an available letter.
   - Position 3 must use an available letter (could be a repeated L, but caution: previous guesses haven't tested L elsewhere).

### Strategy:
- Focus on 5-letter words matching the pattern `_ U _ L _` using remaining letters.
- Prioritize high-frequency letters (e.g., F, G, H, K, M, Y) to maximize information.
- Possible candidates:
  - **FULLY**: Tests F (position 1), L (position 3), and Y (position 5). L at position 3 is plausible since L wasn't tested elsewhere.
  - **GULLY**: Tests G (position 1), L (position 3), and Y (position 5).
  - **HULLY** (less common): Tests H (position 1) and Y (position 5).
- Chose **GULLY** because:
  - Uses common letters (G, Y) not yet tested.
  - If L is present at position 3, feedback will confirm (likely, given L is at position 4).
  - Rules out alternatives like FULLY if G is absent/revealed.",Guess 4: gully -> FEEDBACK: G(x) U(✓) L(✓) L(✓) Y(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' — which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are on the second guess. The first guess was ""crane"" and we received feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x). This means that none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.

 Since none of these letters are in the word, we must avoid using them in our next guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain any of the letters C, R, A, N, E.

 Let's think of common vowels and consonants that we haven't tried yet. Vowels: we have used A and E, so we can try O, I, U. Consonants: many left such as S, T, L, B, D, G, H, K, M, P, etc.

 A good strategy is to pick a word that uses other common letters to get more information.

 For example, words like ""SLIMY"", ""POUND"", ""LIGHT"" might be options, but we must ensure no excluded letters.

 Let me brainstorm some words without C, R, A, N, E:

 - Using common letters: S, T, L, O, I, U, etc.

 Possible words:
   ""TOILS"" - but we want more coverage.
   ""PIOUS"" - again, let's try for more common letters.
   ""SHOUT"" - includes S, H, O, U, T -> these are common and we haven't tried them.

 Alternatively, ""SLOTH"" or ""PLUSH"".

 Another popular starting word is ""SHINE"" but E is excluded so not allowed.

 Since E is excluded, we can't use it.

 Let me find a word without C, R, A, N, E.

 Consider ""WOULD"" - but we don't have W and D, but they are less common. Better to focus on more frequent letters.

 Common letters without the excluded ones: S, T, L, O, P, I, D, G, H, U, B, K, etc.

 I think ""SPOUT"" would be a good guess: S, P, O, U, T. All common letters.

 Another option: ""BLUSH"" - B, L, U, S, H.

 We want to maximize new letter coverage.

 Let's go with ""SPOUT"": 
   S, P, O, U, T - all new, and gets us vowels O and U, and common consonants S, P, T.

 Alternatively, we can use a word that has two of a vowel to test? But that might not be efficient.

 Since it's the second guess, let's stick with all new letters.

 Decide on ""SPOUT"".

<guess>spout</guess>Given that the first guess ""crane"" had all letters marked as absent (C, R, A, N, E), the secret word contains none of these letters. For my next guess, I need to choose a word with entirely different letters to maximize information. I'll prioritize common unused consonants (like S, T, L, P, D) and vowels (O, U, I).

A good candidate is **""SPOUT""**:
- Uses high-frequency letters not yet tried: S, P, O, U, T
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, E)
- Tests two vowels (O, U) and three common consonants

This helps probe a new set of letters efficiently.

<guess>spout</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: spout -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(x) U(-) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are on the third guess. Previous feedback:
- Guess 1: ""crane"" -> all letters absent: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
- Guess 2: ""spout"" -> S(x), P(x), O(x), U(-), T(x)

The feedback for ""spout"" shows:
- U is present in the word but in the wrong position (since it's marked with -).
- S, P, O, T are absent.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter U, but not in the last position (since we placed U at the fourth position and it was wrong).

Also, from the first guess, we know the word has no C, R, A, N, E.

So, absent letters so far: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, O, T.

We must include U in our next guess, but not in the fourth position.

We also need to avoid the absent letters.

Now, we have to think of a 5-letter word that:
- Contains U (but not in position 4)
- Does not contain C, R, A, N, E, S, P, O, T

What letters are left? Let's list the alphabet and remove the absent ones.

Alphabet: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z

Absent: A, C, E, N, O, P, R, S, T

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But we know U is in the word, so we must use it.

We also want to use common letters to maximize information.

Common letters from the available set: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, U

We need to form a 5-letter word with these, including U (not in position 4).

Possible positions for U: 1,2,3,5 (since position 4 is wrong).

Let's think of words that fit.

Some ideas:

- Words starting with U: but we have to use available letters. Examples: UDDER (but D is available, but E and R are absent? R is absent, E is absent. So not possible). UDDER has E and R which are absent.

- Words with U in second position: e.g., GUILD (G,U,I,L,D) — all available? G, U, I, L, D are all in the available set. And no absent letters. Also, U is in position 2, which is allowed.

- Another: BUILD (B,U,I,L,D) — similar.

- U in third position: e.g., MAULS (but S is absent) — not allowed.

- U in fifth position: e.g., BAYOU — but O is absent, and A is absent. Not allowed.

So let's consider:

- GUILD: G, U, I, L, D — all available. U in position 2.
- BUILD: B, U, I, L, D — all available. U in position 2.

Both are valid words.

We could also try to include more common letters.

Another word: LUCKY — but C is absent, and we don't have C.

Or FLUID: F, L, U, I, D — all available. U in position 3.

FLUID: positions: F(1), L(2), U(3), I(4), D(5). But in ""spout"", U was in position 4 and was wrong. Now we are putting U in position 3, which is different, so that's fine.

Similarly, we could have GUID (too short), needs 5 letters.

Another: HUMID — H, U, M, I, D. U in position 2. All available.

But we don't know if H, M, etc. are in the word.

We need to choose a word that tests new letters.

Since we have limited information, we should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

Common letters available: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, U

We can try to use a word with U and four other new letters.

For example, ""BUILD"" uses B, U, I, L, D.

""GUILD"" uses G, U, I, L, D.

""FLUID"" uses F, L, U, I, D.

""HUMID"" uses H, U, M, I, D.

All are good.

But note that in ""BUILD"", ""GUILD"", and ""FLUID"", we are repeating I, L, D in multiple options. We might want to test different sets.

Since we have to include U, and we know it's not in position 4, we can try position 1,2,3, or 5.

Position 5: words ending with U? Not common in English. Like BAYOU (absent letters), so probably not.

So positions 1,2,3.

Let me pick ""FLUID"" because it has F and U, and we haven't tested F or L or D yet.

But we also haven't tested B, G, H, K, M, etc.

Another common word: ""QUICK"" — but Q and C? C is absent, and Q is not in our available? Actually, Q is available, but we have to see. ""QUICK"" has Q, U, I, C, K. But C is absent, so not allowed.

So avoid C.

""JUICE"" — J, U, I, C, E — C and E absent.

Not allowed.

So back to ""FLUID"" or ""BUILD"".

I think ""BUILD"" is a good choice because B is a common consonant.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

Alternatively, we can use ""DUTCH"" — but T is absent? T is absent from guess 2, so no.

T is absent.

So no.

Another: ""MUCUS"" — S is absent, and we have two U's? But S is absent.

Not allowed.

So let's go with ""BUILD"": B, U, I, L, D.

We place U in position 2, which is different from the previous position 4.

We test B, U, I, L, D.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Similarly, ""GUILD"" is also good.

But ""BUILD"" might be more common.

We could also consider ""HUMID"" to test H and M.

But let's choose one.

I'll go with ""BUILD"".

So the guess is ""BUILD"".

But note: in ""BUILD"", U is in position 2. We don't know if that's correct or not, but we are trying to find the position.

We have to avoid the absent letters.

Confirm: B, U, I, L, D — none of C,R,A,N,E,S,P,O,T. Good.

So <guess>build</guess>Based on the previous feedback:
- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent. This means the secret word contains none of these letters.
- **Guess 2: spout** → Only U is present but in the wrong position (as indicated by `-`). Letters S, P, O, T are absent.

### Key Insights:
1. **U is in the secret word**, but not in the 4th position (since it was misplaced there in ""spout"").
2. **Absent letters so far**: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, O, T. These cannot appear in the secret word.
3. **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (since U is confirmed present, and others are untested).
4. **Strategy for next guess**:
   - Must include **U** (but not in the 4th position).
   - Use common unused letters (e.g., B, D, H, I, L, M) to maximize information.
   - Avoid absent letters.
   - Good candidates: Words like **BUILD** (tests B, U, I, L, D) or **HUMID** (tests H, U, M, I, D). I chose **BUILD** because it:
     - Places U in position 2 (a new position to test).
     - Uses high-frequency consonants (B, L, D) and a vowel (I).
     - Avoids rarer letters (e.g., J, Q, Z).

 Guess 3: build -> Feedback: B(x), U(✓), I(x), L(✓), D(x)

 Now, from guess 3: 
   U is correct and in position 2 (since we placed U in position 2 and it got ✓).
   L is correct and in position 4 (since we placed L in position 4 and it got ✓).
   B, I, D are absent.

 So, secret word has:
   Second letter: U
   Fourth letter: L
   Does not contain: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,O,T,B,I,D

 We know the word has U in position 2 and L in position 4.

 Absent letters so far: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,O,T,B,I,D

 Available letters: F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z and perhaps some others, but excluding the absent ones.

 Since we have two positions fixed: 
   Position 2: U
   Position 4: L

 The word is: _ U _ L _

 We need to guess the first, third, and fifth letters.

 The absent letters include common ones, so we must use from the remaining: F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z.

 We must pick a word that fits the pattern _ U _ L _ and uses letters from the available set.

 Let's list possible words:

 Common letters left: F,G,H,K,M,V,W,X,Y,Z (J and Q less common, but possible).

 We also know that in the second guess, U was in position 4 and incorrectly placed? Actually, in ""spout"", U was in position 4 and it was marked as wrong position, meaning U is in the word but not in position 4. Now we know it's in position 2, which is consistent.

 Now, let's think of words that match _ U _ L _

 Examples:
   - FUGLE: But G? and E is absent? E is absent, so no.
   - HULLY: H,U,L,L,Y? But Y is available, but we are missing the fifth letter? Wait, pattern: position 1=H, 2=U, 3=L? But then position 3 is L? Then position 4=L? That would be H U L L Y. But we have position 4=L, but if position 3 is also L, that's two L's? But we don't know if L is repeated.

 However, in feedback from ""build"", we have L as correct at position 4, but we don't know what happened at position 3 because we placed I at position 3 which was absent. So L could be elsewhere? Actually, when we placed L at position 4 and it was correct, that does not say anything about whether L occurs elsewhere. But in our guess, we only put one L.

 But the feedback marks each letter individually. So we only marked L in position 4 as correct. Does not preclude another L.

 However, we have to consider if the word could have multiple L's.

 But we don't know for sure.

 Now, let's form a word: 
   Position 1: can be any available letter, say H, K, M, etc.
   Position 3: any available letter
   Position 5: any available letter

 And the word must be valid.

 Possible words:
   - ""HUMUS"": But U at position 2, then M? Position 3=M, then U at position 4? But we require L at position 4. HUMUS has position 4=U, but we need L. So not.
   - ""FULLY"": F,U,L,L,Y? Then positions: 1=F,2=U,3=L,4=L,5=Y. But then position 4 is L which matches. And position 3 is L. But we have to check letters: F,U,L,L,Y. But L is correct at position 4? Yes. However, in the third guess, we had only one L and it was at position 4. If there was another L, then the feedback for ""build"" would have shown it? We placed L at position 4 and got it correct. If there was another L, say at position 3, then the letter I at position 3 would be wrong (I is absent) but the L at position 3 would be unaccounted? In our guess ""build"", we did not have L at position 3, so we wouldn't know.

 However, the feedback for ""build"" says: B(x) U(✓) I(x) L(✓) D(x). So only two positions are correct: position 2 (U) and position 4 (L). The L at position 4 is the only L we placed. If there were another L in the secret word, it might be revealed if we hit it? But we didn't. So it's possible the word has two L's.

 But let's check if ""FULLY"" is allowed: Letters F,U,L,L,Y.

 Now, we need to check for absent letters: F is not absent? F hasn't been tested. U is used. L is used. Y has not been tested.

 But we must ensure the letters are not in the absent list. Absent: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,O,T,B,I,D. So F is available.

 However, ""FULLY"" would be: F(1), U(2), L(3), L(4), Y(5). But our pattern is position 4=L, which is satisfied. But position 3 is L? Then the L at position 3 is also correct? But in the secret word, if position 4 is L, then position 3 being L is another L? So when we guess ""build"", we had no L at position 3 (we had I), so the feedback only marked the L at position 4. It doesn't tell us about other positions.

 But in ""FULLY"", we would have two L's. The problem is that in our absent list, we have no reason to exclude L elsewhere.

 But let's see: if the secret word is ""FULLY"", then:
   Position 1: F (we didn't guess F before)
   Position 2: U (correct)
   Position 3: L (we guessed I at position 3 in ""build"", which is absent, so good)
   Position 4: L (we guessed L and it was correct)
   Position 5: Y (we didn't guess Y)

 So it fits.

 But is ""FULLY"" a 5-letter word? Yes.

 However, we have the feedback from guess 2: U(-) meaning U is present but not in position 4. In ""FULLY"", U is in position 2, so that's consistent.

 Now, another word: ""GULLY"": G,U,L,L,Y. Similar.

 Or ""HULKY"": H,U,L,K,Y? Then positions: 1=H,2=U,3=L,4=K? But position 4 must be L. In ""HULKY"", position 4 would be K, which is not L. So not.

 What about ""HUMBLY""? Too long.

 Or ""JUMBL"": But not common, and B is absent? Wait, B is absent? In our absent list: B,I,D are absent from guess 3. So B and D are out.

 So we cannot use B or D.

 Therefore, in our guess, we must avoid C,R,A,N,E,S,P,O,T,B,I,D.

 So let's list available: F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z

 Now, back to words:
   - ""FULLY"": F,U (fixed?), not fixed at position1, we need to use letter1 from available. So F is available. Then L: we know we can use L? No, we placed L and it was correct? Wait, L is in the word and we used it. But the feedback doesn't mark L as absent? So L is not in the absent list. Actually, absent list is only the ones marked 'x'. In guess3, L was marked ✓ so it is in the word and in correct position? But that doesn't mean it can't be used again? Actually, we should avoid using L in other positions? No, unless we know that it's not elsewhere? But we don't know. 

 The rules: we can use letters multiple times? But in feedback, when we placed L at position4 and it was ✓, that doesn't tell us about whether there is another L. Similarly, if there was an extra L we might get a '-' or ✓ if we place it correctly.

 But in this case, when we guess a word, we can repeat letters if we think there are multiple.

 However, for now, let's consider words without L in positions other than 4? Because we haven't tested other positions for L? Actually, we should test.

 To save guesses, we want to make a guess that fits the pattern and uses available letters.

 Possibilities:
   _ U _ L _

 We must fill:
   Position 1: available letter F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z
   Position 3: available letter (same set, and can be same as position1? but in word, it can be)
   Position 5: available letter.

 Now, common words:
   - ""FULLY"": F,U,L,L,Y -> position 3 is L. So we are putting L at position 3 and 4? But position 4 is fixed to L. Then position 5=Y.
   - ""GULLY"": G,U,L,L,Y
   - ""HULLY"": H,U,L,L,Y? As a word? ""Hully"" is not common. But ""HULKY"" doesn't work because position 4 must be L.

 Other words without double L? 
   For example: 
     - ""FUGLE""? but E absent and G not sure? But E absent.
     - ""JUMPS"": S absent and P absent -> not allowed.
     - ""MUMMY"": M,U,M,M,Y -> but position 4 is M, should be L -> not.

 So likely words are with L in position 3? Such as FULLY, GULLY, etc.

 But note: in the secret word, position 4 is L. So if we put L at position 3, then that L would be a different occurrence? Or the same? Actually, if the word has two L's, that's possible.

 We also know U is in position 2.

 So let's try ""FULLY"": 
   - F: not guessed before? Not absent. So okay.
   - U: known
   - L: at position 3? But we don't know if it's correct. And at position 4: L is fixed.
   - Y: not tried.

 But we need to make a guess that can be used to get more information. However, since we only have 3 guesses left, and we know two positions, we can guess such a word.

 Another word: ""HUMAN""? But A absent and N absent.

 Not.

 ""KULAK"": K,U,L,A,K -> A absent.

 Not.

 ""VULGAR"": G and A? A absent. Also, too long? Wait, must be 5 letters.

 So not.

 So possible 5-letter words: FULLY, GULLY, MULSH? Not a word.

 What about ""GAUZY""? G,A,U,Z,Y -> A absent? A is absent.

 Then ""QUERY"": Q,U,E,R,Y -> E and R absent.

 Not.

 So perhaps FULLY or GULLY.

 But also ""JUMBY""? J,U,M,B,Y -> B absent? Yes, B is absent from guess3.

 Not.

 So FULLY and GULLY are candidates.

 Let me check the word list.

 But another: ""LUCKY"": C and K? C absent, so not.

 So let me pick ""FULLY"": F,U,L,L,Y.

 But we have to check if L in position 3 is okay? Yes, because we haven't placed L at position 3 before? And we don't know if it's in the word or not at position 3? Wait, we know L is in the word at position 4, but we don't know if it exists elsewhere.

 In ""FULLY"", L is at position 3 and 4. So when we guess, we can see if it marks position 3 as present.

 But let's see: if the secret word is, say, ""GAWKY"", but that doesn't have U or L.

 Another word: ""FUNKY"": F,U,N,K,Y -> N absent.

 Not.

 So without common letters, let's try FULLY.

 Alternatively, we could guess a word that doesn't have double L to avoid putting L at position 3? Because if L is not at position 3, we might get information.

 For example, what about ""FUGUE""? F,U,G,U,E -> E absent and U repeated? But U is fixed at position 2, so position 4 must be L, so we cannot use U again? Actually, the word must have L at position 4, so any word without L at position 4 is invalid.

 So must have L at position 4.

 Therefore, the word is _ U _ L _

 So we are forced to have the pattern.

 Now, without using L in position 3? We don't have to, but what letter to use? 

 For example: 
   - ""HUFFL"": Not a word.
   - ""GUFFL"": Not a word.
   - ""MUFFY"": M,U,F,F,Y -> then position 4 must be F? But we have to put L at position 4. So no, we cannot.

 Unless we use L only at position 4.

 Then, words that have position 3 not L.

 Example: ""KUFIC"": But not common, and I absent? Guess3: I is absent. So I cannot be used.

 Words without I and D and B, etc.

 What about ""JUMPS"": but S and P absent.

 Not.

 Or ""MUSHY"": M,U,S,H,Y -> S absent (from guess2) and position 4 should be L? So not L.

 So how about words like ""HULKY"": but position 4 would be K? Not L. Can't be.

 So it must have L at position 4, and U at 2.

 Then the only words are those with _ U [something] L [last letter].

 Possibles: 
   position 3 = L? Then it's the double L pattern: fully, gully, hully (if valid), hully might mean something? Or mulls? But mulls has S absent, and also double L.

 But if we don't want double L, then we need position 3 to be a different letter that is available.

 Let me try to find words:

 Consider ""UMBEL"": but E absent and U at start? But position 1 must be set.

 Use a dictionary of 5-letter words that fit the pattern.

 One example: ""FUZIL"" — let me see: F,U,Z,I,L? But then position 4 would be I? And position 5=L? Then the pattern would be _ U _ L _? Wait:

 FUZIL: 
   position 1: F
   position 2: U
   position 3: Z
   position 4: I? 
   position 5: L

 But we need position 4 to be L. So that would not fit. That has I at position 4.

 Similarly, ""FUGAL"": has A absent and G? Position 4=A? But absent.

 So it seems difficult. Perhaps ""GUILD"" was a word, but D is absent and I is absent? In our case, I and D are absent.

 Another thought: we have not tried G, K, V, etc.

 What about ""BUGLE"": B absent and E absent.

 Not.

 ""GULPH"": G,U,L,P,H -> P absent.

 So, I think we have to consider words with L at position 3 and 4? That is, FULLY, GULLY, etc.

 Or ""CAULK"": C absent, A absent.

 Not.

 So between FULLY and GULLY, they are similar. Let's pick ""GULLY"": G,U,L,L,Y.

 Because G is a common letter.

 But we are forced to make a guess that might have double L.

 Alternatively, let me think of another word: ""NUCHA""? N absent.

 So I think we have to guess GULLY or FULLY.

 I'll pick ""GULLY"": G,U,L,L,Y.

 We'll see the feedback.

<guess>gully</guess>

But note: in ""GU L LY"", at position 4 is L, which is correct. At position 3 is L, which might be correct or not? But it's a guess.

 If the feedback comes with:
   G at position1: unknown
   U at2: ✓ (fixed)
   L at3: ? 
   L at4: ✓ (fixed)
   Y at5: ?

 And if there is only one L? No, if there are two L's.

 Given the feedback, we may get clues.

 But we have to avoid double-guessing? We have to go.

 So my guess is ""gully"".### Analysis and Reasoning for Next Guess
The feedback from previous guesses reveals:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent → Eliminate these letters.
- **Guess 2 (spout)**: 
  - U is present but misplaced (marked `-`). S, P, O, T are absent → Eliminate these letters.
- **Guess 3 (build)**:
  - U (position 2) and L (position 4) are correct (marked `✓`).
  - B, I, D are absent → Eliminate these letters.

### Key Insights:
1. **Fixed positions in the secret word**:
   - Position 2: **U**
   - Position 4: **L**
   - Pattern: `[?] U [?] L [?]`
2. **Absent letters (cannot appear)**: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, O, T, B, I, D.
3. **Remaining available letters**: F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
4. **Constraints**:
   - The word must start/end with an available letter.
   - Position 3 must use an available letter (could be a repeated L, but caution: previous guesses haven't tested L elsewhere).

### Strategy:
- Focus on 5-letter words matching the pattern `_ U _ L _` using remaining letters.
- Prioritize high-frequency letters (e.g., F, G, H, K, M, Y) to maximize information.
- Possible candidates:
  - **FULLY**: Tests F (position 1), L (position 3), and Y (position 5). L at position 3 is plausible since L wasn't tested elsewhere.
  - **GULLY**: Tests G (position 1), L (position 3), and Y (position 5).
  - **HULLY** (less common): Tests H (position 1) and Y (position 5).
- Chose **GULLY** because:
  - Uses common letters (G, Y) not yet tested.
  - If L is present at position 3, feedback will confirm (likely, given L is at position 4).
  - Rules out alternatives like FULLY if G is absent/revealed.

Examples: UDDER (but D is available, but E and R are absent? R is absent, E is absent. So not possible). UDDER has E and R which are absent.\n\n- Words with U in second position: e.g., GUILD (G,U,I,L,D) — all available? G, U, I, L, D are all in the available set. And no absent letters. Also, U is in position 2, which is allowed.\n\n- Another: BUILD (B,U,I,L,D) — similar.\n\n- U in third position: e.g., MAULS (but S is absent) — not allowed.\n\n- U in fifth position: e.g., BAYOU — but O is absent, and A is absent. Not allowed.\n\nSo let\'s consider:\n\n- GUILD: G, U, I, L, D — all available. U in position 2.\n- BUILD: B, U, I, L, D — all available. U in position 2.\n\nBoth are valid words.\n\nWe could also try to include more common letters.\n\nAnother word: LUCKY — but C is absent, and we don\'t have C.\n\nOr FLUID: F, L, U, I, D — all available. U in position 3.\n\nFLUID: positions: F(1), L(2), U(3), I(4), D(5). But in ""spout"", U was in position 4 and was wrong. Now we are putting U in position 3, which is different, so that\'s fine.\n\nSimilarly, we could have GUID (too short), needs 5 letters.\n\nAnother: HUMID — H, U, M, I, D. U in position 2. All available.\n\nBut we don\'t know if H, M, etc. are in the word.\n\nWe need to choose a word that tests new letters.\n\nSince we have limited information, we should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.\n\nCommon letters available: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, U\n\nWe can try to use a word with U and four other new letters.\n\nFor example, ""BUILD"" uses B, U, I, L, D.\n\n""GUILD"" uses G, U, I, L, D.\n\n""FLUID"" uses F, L, U, I, D.\n\n""HUMID"" uses H, U, M, I, D.\n\nAll are good.\n\nBut note that in ""BUILD"", ""GUILD"", and ""FLUID"", we are repeating I, L, D in multiple options. We might want to test different sets.\n\nSince we have to include U, and we know it\'s not in position 4, we can try position 1,2,3, or 5.\n\nPosition 5: words ending with U? Not common in English. Like BAYOU (absent letters), so probably not.\n\nSo positions 1,2,3.\n\nLet me pick ""FLUID"" because it has F and U, and we haven\'t tested F or L or D yet.\n\nBut we also haven\'t tested B, G, H, K, M, etc.\n\nAnother common word: ""QUICK"" — but Q and C? C is absent, and Q is not in our available? Actually, Q is available, but we have to see. ""QUICK"" has Q, U, I, C, K. But C is absent, so not allowed.\n\nSo avoid C.\n\n""JUICE"" — J, U, I, C, E — C and E absent.\n\nNot allowed.\n\nSo back to ""FLUID"" or ""BUILD"".\n\nI think ""BUILD"" is a good choice because B is a common consonant.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we might get.\n\nAlternatively, we can use ""DUTCH"" — but T is absent? T is absent from guess 2, so no.\n\nT is absent.\n\nSo no.\n\nAnother: ""MUCUS"" — S is absent, and we have two U\'s? But S is absent.\n\nNot allowed.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""BUILD"": B, U, I, L, D.\n\nWe place U in position 2, which is different from the previous position 4.\n\nWe test B, U, I, L, D.\n\nIf we get feedback, we can narrow down.\n\nSimilarly, ""GUILD"" is also good.\n\nBut ""BUILD"" might be more common.\n\nWe could also consider ""HUMID"" to test H and M.\n\nBut let\'s choose one.\n\nI\'ll go with ""BUILD"".\n\nSo the guess is ""BUILD"".\n\nBut note: in ""BUILD"", U is in position 2. We don\'t know if that\'s correct or not, but we are trying to find the position.\n\nWe have to avoid the absent letters.\n\nConfirm: B, U, I, L, D — none of C,R,A,N,E,S,P,O,T. Good.\n\nSo <guess>build</guess>Based on the previous feedback:\n- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent. This means the secret word contains none of these letters.\n- **Guess 2: spout** → Only U is present but in the wrong position (as indicated by `-`). Letters S, P, O, T are absent.\n\n### Key Insights:\n1. **U is in the secret word**, but not in the 4th position (since it was misplaced there in ""spout"").\n2. **Absent letters so far**: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, O, T. These cannot appear in the secret word.\n3. **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (since U is confirmed present, and others are untested).\n4. **Strategy for next guess**:\n   - Must include **U** (but not in the 4th position).\n   - Use common unused letters (e.g., B, D, H, I, L, M) to maximize information.\n   - Avoid absent letters.\n   - Good candidates: Words like **BUILD** (tests B, U, I, L, D) or **HUMID** (tests H, U, M, I, D). I chose **BUILD** because it:\n     - Places U in position 2 (a new position to test).\n     - Uses high-frequency consonants (B, L, D) and a vowel (I).\n     - Avoids rarer letters (e.g., J, Q, Z).\n\n<guess>build</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: spout -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(x) U(-) T(x)\nGuess 3: build -> FEEDBACK: B(x) U(✓) I(x) L(✓) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are on the fourth guess.\n Previous feedback:\n Guess 1: crane -> all absent: C,R,A,N,E not in word.\n Guess 2: spout -> S,P,O,T absent, U present but wrong position (specifically, position 4 is wrong).\n Guess 3: build -> Feedback: B(x), U(✓), I(x), L(✓), D(x)\n\n Now, from guess 3: \n   U is correct and in position 2 (since we placed U in position 2 and it got ✓).\n   L is correct and in position 4 (since we placed L in position 4 and it got ✓).\n   B, I, D are absent.\n\n So, secret word has:\n   Second letter: U\n   Fourth letter: L\n   Does not contain: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,O,T,B,I,D\n\n We know the word has U in position 2 and L in position 4.\n\n Absent letters so far: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,O,T,B,I,D\n\n Available letters: F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z and perhaps some others, but excluding the absent ones.\n\n Since we have two positions fixed: \n   Position 2: U\n   Position 4: L\n\n The word is: _ U _ L _\n\n We need to guess the first, third, and fifth letters.\n\n The absent letters include common ones, so we must use from the remaining: F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\n We must pick a word that fits the pattern _ U _ L _ and uses letters from the available set.\n\n Let\'s list possible words:\n\n Common letters left: F,G,H,K,M,V,W,X,Y,Z (J and Q less common, but possible).\n\n We also know that in the second guess, U was in position 4 and incorrectly placed? Actually, in ""spout"", U was in position 4 and it was marked as wrong position, meaning U is in the word but not in position 4. Now we know it\'s in position 2, which is consistent.\n\n Now, let\'s think of words that match _ U _ L _\n\n Examples:\n   - FUGLE: But G? and E is absent? E is absent, so no.\n   - HULLY: H,U,L,L,Y? But Y is available, but we are missing the fifth letter? Wait, pattern: position 1=H, 2=U, 3=L? But then position 3 is L? Then position 4=L? That would be H U L L Y. But we have position 4=L, but if position 3 is also L, that\'s two L\'s? But we don\'t know if L is repeated.\n\n However, in feedback from ""build"", we have L as correct at position 4, but we don\'t know what happened at position 3 because we placed I at position 3 which was absent. So L could be elsewhere? Actually, when we placed L at position 4 and it was correct, that does not say anything about whether L occurs elsewhere. But in our guess, we only put one L.\n\n But the feedback marks each letter individually. So we only marked L in position 4 as correct. Does not preclude another L.\n\n However, we have to consider if the word could have multiple L\'s.\n\n But we don\'t know for sure.\n\n Now, let\'s form a word: \n   Position 1: can be any available letter, say H, K, M, etc.\n   Position 3: any available letter\n   Position 5: any available letter\n\n And the word must be valid.\n\n Possible words:\n   - ""HUMUS"": But U at position 2, then M? Position 3=M, then U at position 4? But we require L at position 4. HUMUS has position 4=U, but we need L. So not.\n   - ""FULLY"": F,U,L,L,Y? Then positions: 1=F,2=U,3=L,4=L,5=Y. But then position 4 is L which matches. And position 3 is L. But we have to check letters: F,U,L,L,Y. But L is correct at position 4? Yes. However, in the third guess, we had only one L and it was at position 4. If there was another L, then the feedback for ""build"" would have shown it? We placed L at position 4 and got it correct. If there was another L, say at position 3, then the letter I at position 3 would be wrong (I is absent) but the L at position 3 would be unaccounted? In our guess ""build"", we did not have L at position 3, so we wouldn\'t know.\n\n However, the feedback for ""build"" says: B(x) U(✓) I(x) L(✓) D(x). So only two positions are correct: position 2 (U) and position 4 (L). The L at position 4 is the only L we placed. If there were another L in the secret word, it might be revealed if we hit it? But we didn\'t. So it\'s possible the word has two L\'s.\n\n But let\'s check if ""FULLY"" is allowed: Letters F,U,L,L,Y.\n\n Now, we need to check for absent letters: F is not absent? F hasn\'t been tested. U is used. L is used. Y has not been tested.\n\n But we must ensure the letters are not in the absent list. Absent: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,O,T,B,I,D. So F is available.\n\n However, ""FULLY"" would be: F(1), U(2), L(3), L(4), Y(5). But our pattern is position 4=L, which is satisfied. But position 3 is L? Then the L at position 3 is also correct? But in the secret word, if position 4 is L, then position 3 being L is another L? So when we guess ""build"", we had no L at position 3 (we had I), so the feedback only marked the L at position 4. It doesn\'t tell us about other positions.\n\n But in ""FULLY"", we would have two L\'s. The problem is that in our absent list, we have no reason to exclude L elsewhere.\n\n But let\'s see: if the secret word is ""FULLY"", then:\n   Position 1: F (we didn\'t guess F before)\n   Position 2: U (correct)\n   Position 3: L (we guessed I at position 3 in ""build"", which is absent, so good)\n   Position 4: L (we guessed L and it was correct)\n   Position 5: Y (we didn\'t guess Y)\n\n So it fits.\n\n But is ""FULLY"" a 5-letter word? Yes.\n\n However, we have the feedback from guess 2: U(-) meaning U is present but not in position 4. In ""FULLY"", U is in position 2, so that\'s consistent.\n\n Now, another word: ""GULLY"": G,U,L,L,Y. Similar.\n\n Or ""HULKY"": H,U,L,K,Y? Then positions: 1=H,2=U,3=L,4=K? But position 4 must be L. In ""HULKY"", position 4 would be K, which is not L. So not.\n\n What about ""HUMBLY""? Too long.\n\n Or ""JUMBL"": But not common, and B is absent? Wait, B is absent? In our absent list: B,I,D are absent from guess 3. So B and D are out.\n\n So we cannot use B or D.\n\n Therefore, in our guess, we must avoid C,R,A,N,E,S,P,O,T,B,I,D.\n\n So let\'s list available: F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z\n\n Now, back to words:\n   - ""FULLY"": F,U (fixed?), not fixed at position1, we need to use letter1 from available. So F is available. Then L: we know we can use L? No, we placed L and it was correct? Wait, L is in the word and we used it. But the feedback doesn\'t mark L as absent? So L is not in the absent list. Actually, absent list is only the ones marked \'x\'. In guess3, L was marked ✓ so it is in the word and in correct position? But that doesn\'t mean it can\'t be used again? Actually, we should avoid using L in other positions? No, unless we know that it\'s not elsewhere? But we don\'t know. \n\n The rules: we can use letters multiple times? But in feedback, when we placed L at position4 and it was ✓, that doesn\'t tell us about whether there is another L. Similarly, if there was an extra L we might get a \'-\' or ✓ if we place it correctly.\n\n But in this case, when we guess a word, we can repeat letters if we think there are multiple.\n\n However, for now, let\'s consider words without L in positions other than 4? Because we haven\'t tested other positions for L? Actually, we should test.\n\n To save guesses, we want to make a guess that fits the pattern and uses available letters.\n\n Possibilities:\n   _ U _ L _\n\n We must fill:\n   Position 1: available letter F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z\n   Position 3: available letter (same set, and can be same as position1? but in word, it can be)\n   Position 5: available letter.\n\n Now, common words:\n   - ""FULLY"": F,U,L,L,Y -> position 3 is L. So we are putting L at position 3 and 4? But position 4 is fixed to L. Then position 5=Y.\n   - ""GULLY"": G,U,L,L,Y\n   - ""HULLY"": H,U,L,L,Y? As a word? ""Hully"" is not common. But ""HULKY"" doesn\'t work because position 4 must be L.\n\n Other words without double L? \n   For example: \n     - ""FUGLE""? but E absent and G not sure? But E absent.\n     - ""JUMPS"": S absent and P absent -> not allowed.\n     - ""MUMMY"": M,U,M,M,Y -> but position 4 is M, should be L -> not.\n\n So likely words are with L in position 3? Such as FULLY, GULLY, etc.\n\n But note: in the secret word, position 4 is L. So if we put L at position 3, then that L would be a different occurrence? Or the same? Actually, if the word has two L\'s, that\'s possible.\n\n We also know U is in position 2.\n\n So let\'s try ""FULLY"": \n   - F: not guessed before? Not absent. So okay.\n   - U: known\n   - L: at position 3? But we don\'t know if it\'s correct. And at position 4: L is fixed.\n   - Y: not tried.\n\n But we need to make a guess that can be used to get more information. However, since we only have 3 guesses left, and we know two positions, we can guess such a word.\n\n Another word: ""HUMAN""? But A absent and N absent.\n\n Not.\n\n ""KULAK"": K,U,L,A,K -> A absent.\n\n Not.\n\n ""VULGAR"": G and A? A absent. Also, too long? Wait, must be 5 letters.\n\n So not.\n\n So possible 5-letter words: FULLY, GULLY, MULSH? Not a word.\n\n What about ""GAUZY""? G,A,U,Z,Y -> A absent? A is absent.\n\n Then ""QUERY"": Q,U,E,R,Y -> E and R absent.\n\n Not.\n\n So perhaps FULLY or GULLY.\n\n But also ""JUMBY""? J,U,M,B,Y -> B absent? Yes, B is absent from guess3.\n\n Not.\n\n So FULLY and GULLY are candidates.\n\n Let me check the word list.\n\n But another: ""LUCKY"": C and K? C absent, so not.\n\n So let me pick ""FULLY"": F,U,L,L,Y.\n\n But we have to check if L in position 3 is okay? Yes, because we haven\'t placed L at position 3 before? And we don\'t know if it\'s in the word or not at position 3? Wait, we know L is in the word at position 4, but we don\'t know if it exists elsewhere.\n\n In ""FULLY"", L is at position 3 and 4. So when we guess, we can see if it marks position 3 as present.\n\n But let\'s see: if the secret word is, say, ""GAWKY"", but that doesn\'t have U or L.\n\n Another word: ""FUNKY"": F,U,N,K,Y -> N absent.\n\n Not.\n\n So without common letters, let\'s try FULLY.\n\n Alternatively, we could guess a word that doesn\'t have double L to avoid putting L at position 3? Because if L is not at position 3, we might get information.\n\n For example, what about ""FUGUE""? F,U,G,U,E -> E absent and U repeated? But U is fixed at position 2, so position 4 must be L, so we cannot use U again? Actually, the word must have L at position 4, so any word without L at position 4 is invalid.\n\n So must have L at position 4.\n\n Therefore, the word is _ U _ L _\n\n So we are forced to have the pattern.\n\n Now, without using L in position 3? We don\'t have to, but what letter to use? \n\n For example: \n   - ""HUFFL"": Not a word.\n   - ""GUFFL"": Not a word.\n   - ""MUFFY"": M,U,F,F,Y -> then position 4 must be F? But we have to put L at position 4. So no, we cannot.\n\n Unless we use L only at position 4.\n\n Then, words that have position 3 not L.\n\n Example: ""KUFIC"": But not common, and I absent? Guess3: I is absent. So I cannot be used.\n\n Words without I and D and B, etc.\n\n What about ""JUMPS"": but S and P absent.\n\n Not.\n\n Or ""MUSHY"": M,U,S,H,Y -> S absent (from guess2) and position 4 should be L? So not L.\n\n So how about words like ""HULKY"": but position 4 would be K? Not L. Can\'t be.\n\n So it must have L at position 4, and U at 2.\n\n Then the only words are those with _ U [something] L [last letter].\n\n Possibles: \n   position 3 = L? Then it\'s the double L pattern: fully, gully, hully (if valid), hully might mean something? Or mulls? But mulls has S absent, and also double L.\n\n But if we don\'t want double L, then we need position 3 to be a different letter that is available.\n\n Let me try to find words:\n\n Consider ""UMBEL"": but E absent and U at start? But position 1 must be set.\n\n Use a dictionary of 5-letter words that fit the pattern.\n\n One example: ""FUZIL"" — let me see: F,U,Z,I,L? But then position 4 would be I? And position 5=L? Then the pattern would be _ U _ L _? Wait:\n\n FUZIL: \n   position 1: F\n   position 2: U\n   position 3: Z\n   position 4: I? \n   position 5: L\n\n But we need position 4 to be L. So that would not fit. That has I at position 4.\n\n Similarly, ""FUGAL"": has A absent and G? Position 4=A? But absent.\n\n So it seems difficult. Perhaps ""GUILD"" was a word, but D is absent and I is absent? In our case, I and D are absent.\n\n Another thought: we have not tried G, K, V, etc.\n\n What about ""BUGLE"": B absent and E absent.\n\n Not.\n\n ""GULPH"": G,U,L,P,H -> P absent.\n\n So, I think we have to consider words with L at position 3 and 4? That is, FULLY, GULLY, etc.\n\n Or ""CAULK"": C absent, A absent.\n\n Not.\n\n So between FULLY and GULLY, they are similar. Let\'s pick ""GULLY"": G,U,L,L,Y.\n\n Because G is a common letter.\n\n But we are forced to make a guess that might have double L.\n\n Alternatively, let me think of another word: ""NUCHA""? N absent.\n\n So I think we have to guess GULLY or FULLY.\n\n I\'ll pick ""GULLY"": G,U,L,L,Y.\n\n We\'ll see the feedback.\n\n<guess>gully</guess>\n\nBut note: in ""GU L LY"", at position 4 is L, which is correct. At position 3 is L, which might be correct or not? But it\'s a guess.\n\n If the feedback comes with:\n   G at position1: unknown\n   U at2: ✓ (fixed)\n   L at3: ? \n   L at4: ✓ (fixed)\n   Y at5: ?\n\n And if there is only one L? No, if there are two L\'s.\n\n Given the feedback, we may get clues.\n\n But we have to avoid double-guessing? We have to go.\n\n So my guess is ""gully"".### Analysis and Reasoning for Next Guess\nThe feedback from previous guesses reveals:\n- **Guess 1 (crane)**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent → Eliminate these letters.\n- **Guess 2 (spout)**: \n  - U is present but misplaced (marked `-`). S, P, O, T are absent → Eliminate these letters.\n- **Guess 3 (build)**:\n  - U (position 2) and L (position 4) are correct (marked `✓`).\n  - B, I, D are absent → Eliminate these letters.\n\n### Key Insights:\n1. **Fixed positions in the secret word**:\n   - Position 2: **U**\n   - Position 4: **L**\n   - Pattern: `[?] U [?] L [?]`\n2. **Absent letters (cannot appear)**: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, O, T, B, I, D.\n3. **Remaining available letters**: F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n4. **Constraints**:\n   - The word must start/end with an available letter.\n   - Position 3 must use an available letter (could be a repeated L, but caution: previous guesses haven\'t tested L elsewhere).\n\n### Strategy:\n- Focus on 5-letter words matching the pattern `_ U _ L _` using remaining letters.\n- Prioritize high-frequency letters (e.g., F, G, H, K, M, Y) to maximize information.\n- Possible candidates:\n  - **FULLY**: Tests F (position 1), L (position 3), and Y (position 5). L at position 3 is plausible since L wasn\'t tested elsewhere.\n  - **GULLY**: Tests G (position 1), L (position 3), and Y (position 5).\n  - **HULLY** (less common): Tests H (position 1) and Y (position 5).\n- Chose **GULLY** because:\n  - Uses common letters (G, Y) not yet tested.\n  - If L is present at position 3, feedback will confirm (likely, given L is at position 4).\n  - Rules out alternatives like FULLY if G is absent/revealed.\n\n<guess>gully</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: spout -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(x) U(-) T(x)\nGuess 3: build -> FEEDBACK: B(x) U(✓) I(x) L(✓) D(x)\nGuess 4: gully -> FEEDBACK: G(x) U(✓) L(✓) L(✓) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
Based on the previous feedback, let's analyze the situation.

**Previous Feedback Summary:**
- Guess 1: ""crane"" → All letters (C,R,A,N,E) absent.
- Guess 2: ""spout"" → Only U present but misplaced (not position 4); S,P,O,T absent.
- Guess 3: ""build"" → U correct in position 2, L correct in position 4; B,I,D absent.
- Guess 4: ""gully"" → Feedback: G(x), U(✓), L(✓), L(✓), Y(✓)

Specifically for Guess 4 (""gully""):
- U in position 2: ✓ (correct and in position)
- Both L's: ✓ (both correct, meaning positions 3 and 4 are both L? In ""gully"", positions are: G(1), U(2), L(3), L(4), Y(5). 
  But feedback shows L at position 3 and position 4 both marked ✓. And Y at position 5: ✓.
- G at position 1: absent (x).

So the secret word is: ? U L L Y
That is, positions: 
  2: U (correct)
  3: L (correct)
  4: L (correct)
  5: Y (correct)

Therefore, based on ""gully"" feedback:
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: L
- Position 4: L (as previously known, but now also confirmed position 3 is L)
- Position 5: Y

And position 1 is G? But G is marked absent (x). So the secret word has positions: 
  1: Not G (and also not any other absent letters)
  2: U
  3: L
  4: L
  5: Y

Only position 1 is unknown.

The secret word is ? U L L Y

But we know from ""gully"" that the last four letters are ULLY.

Position 1 must be a letter that:
  - Is not in the absent list: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,O,T,B,I,D,G
  - And is not U,L,Y (since we already have them? But the letter could be repeated? Position 1 might be the same as U,L or Y? But U,L,Y are already used.)

But potentially, it could be a repeated letter? Although unlikely, let's see.

Absent letters: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,O,T,B,I,D,G

Available letters: F,H,J,K,M,Q,V,W,X,Z

We must guess a word that fits the pattern: _ U L L Y

The word must be five letters, ending with ULLY.

What words exist that match this pattern? Common 5-letter words ending with ULLY:

Actually, many words end with ""ULLY"", such as:
  - FULLY (F-U-L-L-Y)
  - HULLY (H-U-L-L-Y, but might not be common)
  - BULLY (but B is absent)
  - NULLY? Not a word.
  - MULLY? Not common.
  - CULLY? But C absent.
  - DULLY? But D absent.

So based on available letters:
  - FULLY: F is available.
  - HULLY: H is available.
  - KULLY? Not a word.
  - MULLY? As in a proper noun? Not standard.

Valid options: 
  - FULLY: F-U-L-L-Y
  - HULLY: H-U-L-L-Y

But HULLY might not be a recognized word? Let me confirm. Actually, dictionaries may not list it commonly, but it could be accepted in some word games.

Another: ""GULLY"" we already guessed, but G is absent.

So the choices are FULLY or HULLY.

But ""FULLY"" seems common.

We only need to guess position 1.

Therefore, the secret word must be either FULLY or possibly HULLY? But let's check the feedback for ""gully"". If we guessed ""gully"" and got U(✓), L(✓), L(✓), Y(✓), then G was absent. So if the word were ""fully"", then F is available, and we haven't tested F. Similarly for H.

But in the word, position 1: for ""fully"" it's F, for ""hully"" it's H.

We can guess ""fully"".

Since we have one guess left? Actually, we have 6 tries total; this is guess 5? Or 4? Let me count:

Guess 1: crane
Guess 2: spout
Guess 3: build
Guess 4: gully

So now, making guess 5.

We have two possibilities: ""fully"" and ""hully"".

But we can directly guess ""fully"" because:
  - F is available (not tested yet)
  - And ""fully"" is a common word.

If we guess ""fully"" and it's correct, we win. If not, then we guess ""hully"" next.

But we have two guesses left? Total tries: 6, so we have 2 more? Count: guesses made so far: 4, so two left? Or one left? We started with first guess as try 1, so after 4 guesses, we have two more.

But let me confirm: the game gives 6 tries. We are about to make the fifth guess.

We can use one to disambiguate? But we don't need to; we have enough information.

So possible words: FULLY or HULLY? Are there others?

  - JULLY? Not a word.
  - KULLY? Not.
  - MULLY? Possibly.
  - NULLY? No.
  - PULLY? But P absent? Guess 2: P is absent? Yes.
  - WULLY? Not.

So likely: FULLY or HULLY or perhaps MULLY.

But ""MULLY"" is slang or rare. Similarly, ""VULLY""? Not.

So the main candidates are FULLY and HULLY.

To decide between F, H, M, etc.

We can try ""fully"".

Also, note that in the feedback for ""gully"", G was absent? If G is absent, then ""hully"" might be the word? But H and F are both available.

So let me guess ""fully"".

If correct, we finish. If not, we guess ""hully"" next.

But we can guess ""fully"" as the fifth guess.

Therefore, <guess>fully</guess>

But to be thorough, let's see if there's a way to be sure? Not really, so go for the common word.

Final guess: ""fully"".
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Pattern from Feedback**:
   - Guess 4 (""gully"") provides critical feedback:
     - **U(✓)** → Position 2 is confirmed as U.
     - **L(✓), L(✓)** → Positions 3 and 4 are both L.
     - **Y(✓)** → Position 5 is Y.
   - **G(x)** → Position 1 is NOT G.
   - The secret word pattern is thus: `[?] U L L Y`.

2. **Absent Letters**:
   - From all feedback (C, R, A, N, E, S, P, O, T, B, I, D, G), eliminated letters are: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, O, T, B, I, D, G.
   - Available letters for position 1: **F, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z**.

3. **Possible Words**:
   - The word must end in `ULLY`.
   - Plausible options (only common English words):
     - **FULLY** → Uses F (available letter), common word.
     - **HULLY** → Uses H (available), less common but valid (variant of ""hull"").
     - Other `ULLY` words (e.g., BULLY, CULLY, DULLY) are invalid due to absent letters (B, C, D).

4. **Optimization**:
   - Since only position 1 is unknown and guesses are limited, prioritize **FULLY** (most common/frequent word).
   - If wrong, we retain one final guess (6 total tries, 5 used so far) for ""HULLY"".
   
**Conclusion**: Guess **FULLY** to test F in position 1.

<guess>fully</guess>",fully,"Based on the previous feedback, let's analyze the situation.

**Previous Feedback Summary:**
- Guess 1: ""crane"" → All letters (C,R,A,N,E) absent.
- Guess 2: ""spout"" → Only U present but misplaced (not position 4); S,P,O,T absent.
- Guess 3: ""build"" → U correct in position 2, L correct in position 4; B,I,D absent.
- Guess 4: ""gully"" → Feedback: G(x), U(✓), L(✓), L(✓), Y(✓)

Specifically for Guess 4 (""gully""):
- U in position 2: ✓ (correct and in position)
- Both L's: ✓ (both correct, meaning positions 3 and 4 are both L? In ""gully"", positions are: G(1), U(2), L(3), L(4), Y(5). 
  But feedback shows L at position 3 and position 4 both marked ✓. And Y at position 5: ✓.
- G at position 1: absent (x).

So the secret word is: ? U L L Y
That is, positions: 
  2: U (correct)
  3: L (correct)
  4: L (correct)
  5: Y (correct)

Therefore, based on ""gully"" feedback:
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: L
- Position 4: L (as previously known, but now also confirmed position 3 is L)
- Position 5: Y

And position 1 is G? But G is marked absent (x). So the secret word has positions: 
  1: Not G (and also not any other absent letters)
  2: U
  3: L
  4: L
  5: Y

Only position 1 is unknown.

The secret word is ? U L L Y

But we know from ""gully"" that the last four letters are ULLY.

Position 1 must be a letter that:
  - Is not in the absent list: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,O,T,B,I,D,G
  - And is not U,L,Y (since we already have them? But the letter could be repeated? Position 1 might be the same as U,L or Y? But U,L,Y are already used.)

But potentially, it could be a repeated letter? Although unlikely, let's see.

Absent letters: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,O,T,B,I,D,G

Available letters: F,H,J,K,M,Q,V,W,X,Z

We must guess a word that fits the pattern: _ U L L Y

The word must be five letters, ending with ULLY.

What words exist that match this pattern? Common 5-letter words ending with ULLY:

Actually, many words end with ""ULLY"", such as:
  - FULLY (F-U-L-L-Y)
  - HULLY (H-U-L-L-Y, but might not be common)
  - BULLY (but B is absent)
  - NULLY? Not a word.
  - MULLY? Not common.
  - CULLY? But C absent.
  - DULLY? But D absent.

So based on available letters:
  - FULLY: F is available.
  - HULLY: H is available.
  - KULLY? Not a word.
  - MULLY? As in a proper noun? Not standard.

Valid options: 
  - FULLY: F-U-L-L-Y
  - HULLY: H-U-L-L-Y

But HULLY might not be a recognized word? Let me confirm. Actually, dictionaries may not list it commonly, but it could be accepted in some word games.

Another: ""GULLY"" we already guessed, but G is absent.

So the choices are FULLY or HULLY.

But ""FULLY"" seems common.

We only need to guess position 1.

Therefore, the secret word must be either FULLY or possibly HULLY? But let's check the feedback for ""gully"". If we guessed ""gully"" and got U(✓), L(✓), L(✓), Y(✓), then G was absent. So if the word were ""fully"", then F is available, and we haven't tested F. Similarly for H.

But in the word, position 1: for ""fully"" it's F, for ""hully"" it's H.

We can guess ""fully"".

Since we have one guess left? Actually, we have 6 tries total; this is guess 5? Or 4? Let me count:

Guess 1: crane
Guess 2: spout
Guess 3: build
Guess 4: gully

So now, making guess 5.

We have two possibilities: ""fully"" and ""hully"".

But we can directly guess ""fully"" because:
  - F is available (not tested yet)
  - And ""fully"" is a common word.

If we guess ""fully"" and it's correct, we win. If not, then we guess ""hully"" next.

But we have two guesses left? Total tries: 6, so we have 2 more? Count: guesses made so far: 4, so two left? Or one left? We started with first guess as try 1, so after 4 guesses, we have two more.

But let me confirm: the game gives 6 tries. We are about to make the fifth guess.

We can use one to disambiguate? But we don't need to; we have enough information.

So possible words: FULLY or HULLY? Are there others?

  - JULLY? Not a word.
  - KULLY? Not.
  - MULLY? Possibly.
  - NULLY? No.
  - PULLY? But P absent? Guess 2: P is absent? Yes.
  - WULLY? Not.

So likely: FULLY or HULLY or perhaps MULLY.

But ""MULLY"" is slang or rare. Similarly, ""VULLY""? Not.

So the main candidates are FULLY and HULLY.

To decide between F, H, M, etc.

We can try ""fully"".

Also, note that in the feedback for ""gully"", G was absent? If G is absent, then ""hully"" might be the word? But H and F are both available.

So let me guess ""fully"".

If correct, we finish. If not, we guess ""hully"" next.

But we can guess ""fully"" as the fifth guess.

Therefore, <guess>fully</guess>

But to be thorough, let's see if there's a way to be sure? Not really, so go for the common word.

Final guess: ""fully"".### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Pattern from Feedback**:
   - Guess 4 (""gully"") provides critical feedback:
     - **U(✓)** → Position 2 is confirmed as U.
     - **L(✓), L(✓)** → Positions 3 and 4 are both L.
     - **Y(✓)** → Position 5 is Y.
   - **G(x)** → Position 1 is NOT G.
   - The secret word pattern is thus: `[?] U L L Y`.

2. **Absent Letters**:
   - From all feedback (C, R, A, N, E, S, P, O, T, B, I, D, G), eliminated letters are: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, O, T, B, I, D, G.
   - Available letters for position 1: **F, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z**.

3. **Possible Words**:
   - The word must end in `ULLY`.
   - Plausible options (only common English words):
     - **FULLY** → Uses F (available letter), common word.
     - **HULLY** → Uses H (available), less common but valid (variant of ""hull"").
     - Other `ULLY` words (e.g., BULLY, CULLY, DULLY) are invalid due to absent letters (B, C, D).

4. **Optimization**:
   - Since only position 1 is unknown and guesses are limited, prioritize **FULLY** (most common/frequent word).
   - If wrong, we retain one final guess (6 total tries, 5 used so far) for ""HULLY"".
   
**Conclusion**: Guess **FULLY** to test F in position 1.",Guess 5: fully -> FEEDBACK: F(✓) U(✓) L(✓) L(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
