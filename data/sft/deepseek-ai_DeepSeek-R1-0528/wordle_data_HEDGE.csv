First, the secret word is a 5-letter word, and I need to guess it in up to 6 tries. After my first guess ""crane"", I got feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), for N(x), and E(✓). That means E is in the word and in the correct position. Specifically, E is the last letter, position 5.

Feedback breakdown for ""crane"":

- C: x → not in the word

- R: x → not in the word

- A: x → not in the word

- N: x → not in the word

- E: ✓ → in word, correct position (position 5)

So, the secret word ends with E. Also, C, R, A, and N are not in the word at all.

Now, I need to make my second guess. Since E is fixed at the end, I should focus on finding other letters and their positions.

The secret word has E in position 5, and it does not contain C, R, A, or N.

I need to choose a word that has E at the end but avoids using C, R, A, N. Also, since position 5 is E, I should use a word that ends with E.

Common 5-letter words ending with E: there are many, like ""house"", ""price"", ""table"", ""blaze"", etc. But I need to avoid letters that are not in the secret word.

Letters to avoid: C, R, A, N are confirmed not in the word.

Also, since E is at position 5, and it's the only one I know, I should try to include common vowels and consonants that haven't been tested yet.

Untested letters: most of the alphabet except C, R, A, N, E. But E is in, just at position 5.

E is in the word, but I don't know about other positions for E yet, since only position 5 was correct. In fact, since all other positions got x for their letters, and E is ✓ only for position 5, it's possible that there are no other E's or if there are, they might be in different positions. But I have no information about that.

In feedback, for ""crane"", position 4 had N(x), which is x, meaning N is not in the word, but it says nothing about whether E could be elsewhere. Since E was position 5 and got ✓, it only confirms E is at 5. If there were another E, it might not be covered.

But in this case, I don't know yet.

To narrow down, I should use a word with E at the end and include other common letters.

Common letters in English: like S, T, L, O, U, I, D, H, etc.

Avoid C, R, A, N.

Also, the word must be valid, 5 letters.

Possible guess: for example, ""smile"" – S, M, I, L, E. E at end.

That avoids C, R, A, N.

""slide"" – S, L, I, D, E. Also avoids those letters.

""shade"" but A is already excluded, so ""shade"" has A, which is not allowed since A is not in the word. Feedback was A(x) for ""crane"", meaning A is not in the word at all.

Similarly, ""shape"" has A, not good.

""stone"" has O, T, N, E – but N is excluded, since N(x) in first guess.

N is not in the word, so ""stone"" has N, which is bad.

Similarly, I need a word without C, R, A, N.

So, letters to include: new letters, and E at position 5.

Let me list some words ending with E: aside, blaze, plume, guide, suite, pride, but PRIDE has R, excluded; suite has U, I, T, E.

SUITE: S, U, I, T, E.

S, U, I, T are untested.

SUITE is a word.

Other options: ""quite"" – Q, U, I, T, E. Q is less common.

""spite"" – S, P, I, T, E.

""white"" – W, H, I, T, E.

""write"" has R, excluded.

Since R is not in the word.

Perhaps ""house"" – H, O, U, S, E. But H, O, U, S untested.

""mouse"" similar.

I should aim for words with high-frequency letters to maximize information.

English letter frequency: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, etc.

But A, N, R are out; E is in at position 5.

So top untested: T, O, I, S, H, D, L, U, etc.

Better to include multiple of these.

A good word might be ""suite"" or ""spite"" or ""slide"".

""slide"" has S, L, I, D, E.

""store"" has R and O, T, E – but R excluded, so ""store"" has R, which is not good.

R is out, so avoid words with R.

Similarly, A and N out.

So ""slide"": positions: S1, L2, I3, D4, E5.

E is at 5, which is known, so I can use that.

Similarly, ""smile"": S1, M2, I3, L4, E5.

""shine"" has H, I, N, E – N excluded, so no.

""shine"" has N, which is x.

""prime"" has P, R, I, M, E – R excluded.

I think ""slide"" is a good candidate: common letters S, L, I, D.

""spite"" also: S, P, I, T, E – P and T are decent.

""house"": H, O, U, S, E – O, U common.

""guide"": G, U, I, D, E – G less common, but possible.

""louie"" not a word.

Quickly, let's choose ""slide"" or ""suite"".

I'll go with ""slide"" for now.

But D might not be high frequency; T is better.

""suite"" has T, which is common.

""Suite"" is S-U-I-T-E, valid word.

""Spine"" has N, excluded.

""Slime"" has L, I, M, E – S, L, I, M, E. M is fine.

But ""smile"" might be better? ""Smile"" S, M, I, L, E – positions: S1, M2, I3, L4, E5.

Since E is fixed at 5, I can think of testing other positions.

Perhaps to test different vowels, I used C R A N E first, vowels A and E; A is out, E in at 5.

So I should test other vowels: O, I, U.

For example, ""quite"" has I and U, or ""house"" has O and U.

""those"" but has H, O, E – E at 5, but T, H, O, S? ""those"" T-H-O-S-E, positions 1-5.

S is common.

To avoid less common letters.

Another strategic point: since I know E is last, I could try a word with E elsewhere to see if there are multiple E's, but in this case, position 5 is fixed, so if I put E in other positions, but since E is at 5, if I guess a word with E in position 4, for example, it might show if there is another E.

For instance, if I guess ""blame"", but A is out, not possible.

A is out.

Suppose I guess ""phone"", but N is out.

""trued"" not common.

Perhaps later; for now, I should focus on finding new letters.

I think ""slide"" is fine.

I'll choose ""slide"" as my second guess.

Guess: S L I D E

Positions: 1:S, 2:L, 3:I, 4:D, 5:E

E is fixed at 5, so D at 4 is new, etc.

After this, I will get feedback on S, L, I, D with respect to the secret word.

Feedback will tell me for each.

So, in response format: I need to think step by step in <think> and then provide the guess.

Thought process is above.

So for the guess itself:

<guess>slide</guess>

But let me confirm if there's a better word.

""stile"" S-T-I-L-E, but L and E; E at 5, T is good.

""Stile"" is a word, meaning a step or something.

""while"" has H, I, L, E – W, H, I, L, E; W and H.

Similarly, ""smile"" with M.

M is middling frequency.

Perhaps ""suite"" with T.

""Suite"" S-U-I-T-E.

U and T.

U is less frequent than T or S.

S is high frequency.

S, L, I, D in ""slide"" are all decent.

Another word: ""plume"" P-L-U-M-E, but U and P less common.

""shine"" not, N out.

I think ""slide"" is reasonable.

Or ""spite"" S-P-I-T-E.

P and T instead of L and D.

T is more common than L or D.

Letter frequency: E is most common, already known; then T, A (out), O, I, N (out), S, H, R (out), D, L, U.

So top untested: T, O, I, S, H, D, L.

A word that includes T, O, I, S would be good, but with E at end.

E.g., ""toise"" not a word.

""house"" has O, U, H, S, E.

""those"" T-H-O-S-E, has H, O, S, T.

""Those"" is good: T, H, O, S, E.

E at 5, and T, H, O, S are all common untested letters.

Compared to ""slide"" with S, L, I, D – I is vowel, D less common.

""those"" uses more high-frequency letters: T, O, S, H.

And avoids C,R,A,N.

Yes, ""those"" seems better.

T at position 1, H at 2, O at 3, S at 4, E at 5.

Now, since E is always at 5, I can test the other positions.

Secret word ends with E, and doesn't have C,R,A,N.

""those"" could be a good guess.

Other options like ""store"" but R is out.

""phone"" N out.

""shine"" N out.

""quite"" Q less common.

I think ""those"" is a solid choice.

So I'll go with ""those"" for my second guess.
</think>
After the first guess ""crane"" with feedback showing E is correct and in position 5, and C, R, A, N are not in the word, I need to choose a second guess that maximizes information about the secret word.

- The secret word ends with E (position 5) and excludes C, R, A, N.
- I should target common untested letters to cover more possibilities. Based on English letter frequency, high-frequency letters not yet ruled out include T, O, I, S, H, L, D, U. Prioritizing T, O, S, and H is beneficial as they are among the most common.
- The word must be 5 letters, valid English, and avoid C, R, A, N while placing E at the end to confirm its position.
- Good candidates include ""those"" (T,H,O,S,E) or ""house"" (H,O,U,S,E), but ""those"" is preferable as it uses T and O (higher frequency than U) and S, H.
- ""those"" allows testing positions 1-4 with T, H, O, S, which can reveal correct letters and their placements.

1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>First, the secret word is a 5-letter word, and I need to guess it in up to 6 tries. After my first guess ""crane"", I got feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), for N(x), and E(✓). That means E is in the word and in the correct position. Specifically, E is the last letter, position 5.

Feedback breakdown for ""crane"":

- C: x → not in the word

- R: x → not in the word

- A: x → not in the word

- N: x → not in the word

- E: ✓ → in word, correct position (position 5)

So, the secret word ends with E. Also, C, R, A, and N are not in the word at all.

Now, I need to make my second guess. Since E is fixed at the end, I should focus on finding other letters and their positions.

The secret word has E in position 5, and it does not contain C, R, A, or N.

I need to choose a word that has E at the end but avoids using C, R, A, N. Also, since position 5 is E, I should use a word that ends with E.

Common 5-letter words ending with E: there are many, like ""house"", ""price"", ""table"", ""blaze"", etc. But I need to avoid letters that are not in the secret word.

Letters to avoid: C, R, A, N are confirmed not in the word.

Also, since E is at position 5, and it's the only one I know, I should try to include common vowels and consonants that haven't been tested yet.

Untested letters: most of the alphabet except C, R, A, N, E. But E is in, just at position 5.

E is in the word, but I don't know about other positions for E yet, since only position 5 was correct. In fact, since all other positions got x for their letters, and E is ✓ only for position 5, it's possible that there are no other E's or if there are, they might be in different positions. But I have no information about that.

In feedback, for ""crane"", position 4 had N(x), which is x, meaning N is not in the word, but it says nothing about whether E could be elsewhere. Since E was position 5 and got ✓, it only confirms E is at 5. If there were another E, it might not be covered.

But in this case, I don't know yet.

To narrow down, I should use a word with E at the end and include other common letters.

Common letters in English: like S, T, L, O, U, I, D, H, etc.

Avoid C, R, A, N.

Also, the word must be valid, 5 letters.

Possible guess: for example, ""smile"" – S, M, I, L, E. E at end.

That avoids C, R, A, N.

""slide"" – S, L, I, D, E. Also avoids those letters.

""shade"" but A is already excluded, so ""shade"" has A, which is not allowed since A is not in the word. Feedback was A(x) for ""crane"", meaning A is not in the word at all.

Similarly, ""shape"" has A, not good.

""stone"" has O, T, N, E – but N is excluded, since N(x) in first guess.

N is not in the word, so ""stone"" has N, which is bad.

Similarly, I need a word without C, R, A, N.

So, letters to include: new letters, and E at position 5.

Let me list some words ending with E: aside, blaze, plume, guide, suite, pride, but PRIDE has R, excluded; suite has U, I, T, E.

SUITE: S, U, I, T, E.

S, U, I, T are untested.

SUITE is a word.

Other options: ""quite"" – Q, U, I, T, E. Q is less common.

""spite"" – S, P, I, T, E.

""white"" – W, H, I, T, E.

""write"" has R, excluded.

Since R is not in the word.

Perhaps ""house"" – H, O, U, S, E. But H, O, U, S untested.

""mouse"" similar.

I should aim for words with high-frequency letters to maximize information.

English letter frequency: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, etc.

But A, N, R are out; E is in at position 5.

So top untested: T, O, I, S, H, D, L, U, etc.

Better to include multiple of these.

A good word might be ""suite"" or ""spite"" or ""slide"".

""slide"" has S, L, I, D, E.

""store"" has R and O, T, E – but R excluded, so ""store"" has R, which is not good.

R is out, so avoid words with R.

Similarly, A and N out.

So ""slide"": positions: S1, L2, I3, D4, E5.

E is at 5, which is known, so I can use that.

Similarly, ""smile"": S1, M2, I3, L4, E5.

""shine"" has H, I, N, E – N excluded, so no.

""shine"" has N, which is x.

""prime"" has P, R, I, M, E – R excluded.

I think ""slide"" is a good candidate: common letters S, L, I, D.

""spite"" also: S, P, I, T, E – P and T are decent.

""house"": H, O, U, S, E – O, U common.

""guide"": G, U, I, D, E – G less common, but possible.

""louie"" not a word.

Quickly, let's choose ""slide"" or ""suite"".

I'll go with ""slide"" for now.

But D might not be high frequency; T is better.

""suite"" has T, which is common.

""Suite"" is S-U-I-T-E, valid word.

""Spine"" has N, excluded.

""Slime"" has L, I, M, E – S, L, I, M, E. M is fine.

But ""smile"" might be better? ""Smile"" S, M, I, L, E – positions: S1, M2, I3, L4, E5.

Since E is fixed at 5, I can think of testing other positions.

Perhaps to test different vowels, I used C R A N E first, vowels A and E; A is out, E in at 5.

So I should test other vowels: O, I, U.

For example, ""quite"" has I and U, or ""house"" has O and U.

""those"" but has H, O, E – E at 5, but T, H, O, S? ""those"" T-H-O-S-E, positions 1-5.

S is common.

To avoid less common letters.

Another strategic point: since I know E is last, I could try a word with E elsewhere to see if there are multiple E's, but in this case, position 5 is fixed, so if I put E in other positions, but since E is at 5, if I guess a word with E in position 4, for example, it might show if there is another E.

For instance, if I guess ""blame"", but A is out, not possible.

A is out.

Suppose I guess ""phone"", but N is out.

""trued"" not common.

Perhaps later; for now, I should focus on finding new letters.

I think ""slide"" is fine.

I'll choose ""slide"" as my second guess.

Guess: S L I D E

Positions: 1:S, 2:L, 3:I, 4:D, 5:E

E is fixed at 5, so D at 4 is new, etc.

After this, I will get feedback on S, L, I, D with respect to the secret word.

Feedback will tell me for each.

So, in response format: I need to think step by step in <think> and then provide the guess.

Thought process is above.

So for the guess itself:

<guess>slide</guess>

But let me confirm if there's a better word.

""stile"" S-T-I-L-E, but L and E; E at 5, T is good.

""Stile"" is a word, meaning a step or something.

""while"" has H, I, L, E – W, H, I, L, E; W and H.

Similarly, ""smile"" with M.

M is middling frequency.

Perhaps ""suite"" with T.

""Suite"" S-U-I-T-E.

U and T.

U is less frequent than T or S.

S is high frequency.

S, L, I, D in ""slide"" are all decent.

Another word: ""plume"" P-L-U-M-E, but U and P less common.

""shine"" not, N out.

I think ""slide"" is reasonable.

Or ""spite"" S-P-I-T-E.

P and T instead of L and D.

T is more common than L or D.

Letter frequency: E is most common, already known; then T, A (out), O, I, N (out), S, H, R (out), D, L, U.

So top untested: T, O, I, S, H, D, L.

A word that includes T, O, I, S would be good, but with E at end.

E.g., ""toise"" not a word.

""house"" has O, U, H, S, E.

""those"" T-H-O-S-E, has H, O, S, T.

""Those"" is good: T, H, O, S, E.

E at 5, and T, H, O, S are all common untested letters.

Compared to ""slide"" with S, L, I, D – I is vowel, D less common.

""those"" uses more high-frequency letters: T, O, S, H.

And avoids C,R,A,N.

Yes, ""those"" seems better.

T at position 1, H at 2, O at 3, S at 4, E at 5.

Now, since E is always at 5, I can test the other positions.

Secret word ends with E, and doesn't have C,R,A,N.

""those"" could be a good guess.

Other options like ""store"" but R is out.

""phone"" N out.

""shine"" N out.

""quite"" Q less common.

I think ""those"" is a solid choice.

So I'll go with ""those"" for my second guess.After the first guess ""crane"" with feedback showing E is correct and in position 5, and C, R, A, N are not in the word, I need to choose a second guess that maximizes information about the secret word.

- The secret word ends with E (position 5) and excludes C, R, A, N.
- I should target common untested letters to cover more possibilities. Based on English letter frequency, high-frequency letters not yet ruled out include T, O, I, S, H, L, D, U. Prioritizing T, O, S, and H is beneficial as they are among the most common.
- The word must be 5 letters, valid English, and avoid C, R, A, N while placing E at the end to confirm its position.
- Good candidates include ""those"" (T,H,O,S,E) or ""house"" (H,O,U,S,E), but ""those"" is preferable as it uses T and O (higher frequency than U) and S, H.
- ""those"" allows testing positions 1-4 with T, H, O, S, which can reveal correct letters and their placements.

We have two guesses so far:
1. ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓) → E is in the word and at position 5. C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.
2. ""slide"": S(x), L(x), I(x), D(-), E(✓) → D is in the word but not at position 4. S, L, I are not in the word. E is confirmed at position 5.

From this feedback:
- E is fixed at position 5.
- D is in the word, but not at position 4.
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, S, L, I. (since they are marked with 'x')
- Therefore, the word has E in position 5 and contains D in a position other than 4.

Since D is marked with '-' for position 4 in ""slide"", D must be in one of the positions 1, 2, or 3. (Position 4 is wrong, and position 5 is E, so D could be at 1,2,3 but not 4 or 5).

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (position 5)
- Contains D (since D is confirmed present)
- Avoids C, R, A, N, S, L, I (as they are excluded)
- Uses only words with letters that are still possible.

Remaining letters: all letters except: C, R, A, N, S, L, I. But D and E are known; E fixed at end, D somewhere else.

The secret word has pattern: _ _ _ _ E
With D present, not at position 4.

Possible positions for D: 1, 2, or 3.

We need to include D in one of the first three positions in our next guess to test its placement and also test other new letters to narrow down possibilities.

Common letters not yet tested: T, O, U, M, P, B, G, F, H, K, V, W, Y, etc. Prioritize high-frequency letters: T, O, U, H, M, P.

Letter frequencies: T, O, H, M, P are good choices.

We must avoid S, L, I, C, R, A, N.

We know E is at 5, D is somewhere.

Next guess possibilities:

- The word must include D and E, with E at the end.
- D should be placed in position 1, 2, or 3 to check if it's correct elsewhere.

Since D is not at position 4, it might be at 1,2,3. By placing D in different positions, we can test.

But we need to guess a word that is valid and tests multiple new letters.

Options:

- If we put D at position 1: e.g., ""d__ _ e"" endings with E. Words like ""duple"", ""dunce"" but N excluded, not possible. ""duple"" D-U-P-L-E has L excluded. ""dowse"" has S, excluded. ""douse"" D-O-U-S-E, has S excluded. ""doubt"" doesn't end with E. ""dodge"" D-O-D-G-E, but G, and repeats D? Only one D so far we know.

We don't know if there are double D, but feedback didn't indicate anything so assume single for now.

Another word: ""dowle"" not common. ""dovie"" not word. ""dozed"" has Z, less common. So D at 1 might be hard with restrictions.

Put D at position 2: pattern ""_ d _ _ e"". Words like ""oxide"" O-X-I-D-E has I excluded. I is out. ""adept"" A excluded. ""udder"" not ends with E and has R excluded. ""udder"" is UDDER. ""added"" repeats D and not ends with E. ""abled"" A excluded. ""asked"" S and A excluded.

Perhaps ""older"" O-L-D-E-R has L and R excluded. Bad.

""udder"" no E.

Another: ""ampule"" not 5 letters.

This seems tricky.

Place D at position 3: pattern ""_ _ d _ e"". Words like ""budge"" B-U-D-G-E avoids excluded? B,U,D,G,E. All possible except need to check letters: U,G not tested, B not tested. ""guide"" G-U-I-D-E has I excluded.

I is out, so no.

""horde"" has R excluded.

""code"" is 4 letters.

""abode"" A excluded.

Maybe ""prude"" has R and P.

R excluded.

""trade"" T-R-A-D-E has R and A excluded.

Not possible.

Perhaps rethinking: D could be at position 1,2,3, but let's list possible words ending with E and containing D, avoiding S,L,I,C,R,A,N.

Available letters: D, E are known. Possible: B, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, T, U, V, W, Y, Z, etc.

Common words: ""moved"" M-O-V-E-D? But E is at position 5, so pattern _ _ _ _ E, not E at 4. ""moved"" ends with D, not E.

We need words ending with E.

""mode"" M-O-D-E: 4 letters.

5-letter words: ""glade"" A excluded. ""grade"" A and R excluded. ""blade"" A out. ""shade"" A out. ""spade"" A out. All have A.

""deuce"" D-E-U-C-E, C excluded and E at 1? Not ends E.

position: must end E.

Another word: ""dunce"" N out.

""dowse"" S out.

""douse"" S out.

""duple"" L out.

Perhaps ""above"" A out? ""above"" A-B-O-V-E has A, excluded.

Not.

""alive"" A and I out.

""olive"" I and L? L out? L is in ""slide"" L(x), so L is excluded.

In ""slide"", L(x), so L is not in word.

Similarly, S(x), I(x).

So back to square one.

But D must be in the word. So there are words.

For example, ""comet"" doesn't have D.

""depth"" no E.

Perhaps ""outed"" O-U-T-E-D ends with D, not E.

Need to end with E.

""oxide"" has I, excluded.

""pride"" R and I out.

""bride"" R and I out.

""slide"" already guessed, but S,L,I out.

Other words: ""guide"" has I.

""gouge"" no D and ends E.

""rouge"" no D.

""budge"" B-U-D-G-E? Positions: let's say B U D G E, so B1, U2, D3, G4, E5.

This avoids excluded letters: B,U,D,G,E. All not excluded yet.

Is ""budge"" a valid word? Budge - to move. Yes, 5-letter word.

Similarly, ""dodge"" D-O-D-G-E? O and G, D at 1 and 3? ""dodge"" has two D's? Actually, D O D G E, so positions 1:D, 2:O, 3:D, 4:G, 5:E. But from feedback, we know D is in the word, but not letter count yet; so double D might be possible? But in guess 2, D was at position 4, marked (-), meaning D is present but not at 4. If there is only one D, it can't be at 4, so it must be at 1,2,3. If there are two D, it could be, but we don't know.

But for guess, ""budge"" avoids excluded letters: B,U,D,G,E.

Similarly, ""fudge"" F-U-D-G-E, F not tested.

""judge"" J-U-D-G-E, J less common.

""nudge"" N out.

So ""budge"" is possible.

""purge"" no D.

Another word: ""plume"" P-L-U-M-E, L excluded.

""flume"" L and F? Positions F-L-U-M-E, L excluded.

Not.

""bunge"" not common.

""cagey"" no D.

With D at position 2: ""_ d _ _ e""

For instance, ""udden"" not word.

""addie"" not, and A,I excluded.

""oddly"" not ends E.

""model"" L excluded.

""modem"" ends M.

But we need to find words.

""padre"" A,R excluded.

Not possible.

With D at position 1 and other letters.

""dowve"" not word.

""douce"" C excluded.

""douse"" S out.

Perhaps ""debar"" no E.

Ending with E: ""addle"" A excluded and L. ""addle"" A-D-D-L-E, A and L excluded.

Bad.

""puddle"" too long.

5 letter: ""oxide"" I out.

""educe"" E-D-U-C-E C excluded.

Not.

""adobe"" A,O,B,E - A excluded.

Perhaps ""tawed"" ends D.

Not ending E.

Another idea: since position 2 of ""slide"" is L(x), but D is somewhere, perhaps D is at position 1,2,3.

But let's list words ending with ""E"" containing ""D"", avoiding C,R,A,N,S,L,I.

For example: ""homed"" ends D.

""hoped"" ends D.

Must eend with E, so ""home"" is 4.

5-letter words: ""named"" ends D, N,A? N and A excluded.

""faced"" C excluded.

""lived"" L,I out.

""moved"" ends D.

The secret word ends with E, so ""moved"" doesn't work.

Words like ""above"" have A.

Butter: ""butter"" not ends E.

Let's think: ""theme"" T-H-E-M-E? Positions: T1, H2, E3, M4, E5. But we know E is at position 5, so if there is E at position 3, it might be possible. In this case, ""theme"" has E at 3 and 5.

But from first guess ""crane"", position 3 was A(x), that doesn't say about E.

Position 3 in ""crane"" was A, x, so E could be at position 3 if it's in the word.

Similarly, in ""slide"", position 3 was I(x), so E could be elsewhere.

So ""theme"" is a possibility.

""theme"" : T,H,E,M,E. E at 3 and 5? Position 5 is E, position 3 is also E? But in feedback, for ""crane"", position 3 was A, marked x, which means A is not present, but doesn't imply anything about E at position 3. Similarly for ""slide"".

But in ""theme"", letters: T, H, E, M.

E is at position 3 and 5, but position 5 is already E, position 3 is also E. Is that allowed? Yes, if the word has multiple E's.

But we don't know.

""theme"" has E at position 3, but our known E is at position 5.

Now, for ""theme"" to be guessable, it must contain D? No, D is in the secret word, but it doesn't have to be in the guess. The guess can be any word, but to gather information, we should include D because we know it's present.

Since D is known to be in the word, not including D in the guess might waste an opportunity to verify its position.

So it's better to include D in the guess.

But ""theme"" does not have D.

Similarly, ""there"" T-H-E-R-E has R, excluded.

Not.

""where"" W-H-E-R-E has R and multiple E.

R out.

""these"" T-H-E-S-E has S and two E. S excluded.

Not.

So back to D.

Another word: ""dowel"" L and ends L.

Not ends E.

Perhaps ""baked"" ends D.

Not ends E.

I think ""budge"" might be a good choice: B-U-D-G-E, positions B1, U2, D3, G4, E5.

Or ""fudge"" F1 U2 D3 G4 E5.

Both feasible.

""judge"" J1 U2 D3 G4 E5.

J less common.

""dodge"" D1 O2 D3 G4 E5, with two D's.

But maybe ok.

Since in ""slide"", D was at position 4 and marked (-), meaning D is present but not at 4, so if I put D at position 3 in ""budge"", or position 1 in ""dodge"", etc.

Also, can test B, U, G or other letters.

Similarly, ""purde"" not word.

""goude"" not.

I'll go with ""budge"".

But let's see if there is a word with O, T, etc.

"" tode"" not 5.

""mode"" 4 letters.

"" douse"" S out.

"" dowie"" not word.

""howbe"" not.

Another common word: ""movie"" M-O-V-I-E but I excluded in ""slide"" feedback, I(x), so I is not in word.

I is out.

So avoid I.

""above"" A out.

""probe"" P-R-O-B-E has R excluded.

Not.

""grope"" R.

""grace"" C,R,A.

All bad.

""mo ped"" not.

Perhaps ""amped"" ends D, not E.

Word that works: ""vogue"" no D.

I think ""budge"" or ""fudge"" are options.

Let's choose ""budge"".

Or ""cadge"" C excluded.

""badge"" A out.

"" midge"" D? MIDGE has D? M-I-D-G-E, I excluded.

I out.

""bodge"" not common.

"" wodge"" not common.

"" fidge"" not.

So ""budge"" is acceptable.

"" nudge"" N out.

""smudge"" S out.

So yes, ""budge"".

Another possibility: ""g nowe"" not.

""thyme"" T-H-Y-M-E, but H and Y, E at 5.

But no D. We should include D.

""D must be in the secret word, so including it in the guess can help locate its position.

For the third guess, let's say ""budge"": B U D G E

Positions: 1:B, 2:U, 3:D, 4:G, 5:E

After this, feedback will tell us about B, U, D, G: if any are in and where.

D is at position 3; if it shows - or ✓, we know if it's at 3 or elsewhere.

Similarly for other letters.

So, guess: ""budge""

<guess>budge</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **First guess ""crane""**: E is in the word and in the correct position (5), while C, R, A, N are not in the word.
- **Second guess ""slide""**: E is confirmed at position 5, D is in the word but not at position 4, and S, L, I are not in the word.

**Key insights:**
- The secret word has E at position 5 and contains D somewhere, but not at position 4 (so D must be in position 1, 2, or 3).
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, S, L, I (all marked 'x').
- Untested high-frequency letters include T, O, U, M, P, B, G, F, H, K, V, W, Y. Prioritizing T, O, H, M, and P can maximize information.
- The guess must include D to test its position and avoid excluded letters. D should be placed in position 1, 2, or 3 based on possible word options.

**Choosing the third guess:**
- Options considered: 
  - ""budge"" (B, U, D, G, E) – Tests B, U, D (at position 3), G, with E at position 5. Avoids excluded letters and uses common untested consonants (B, G) and a vowel (U).
  - Other words like ""fudge"" or ""judge"" were less ideal due to lower letter frequency (""J"") or redundancy (""F"" similar frequency to ""B"").
- ""budge"" efficiently tests D at position 3 (could reveal if correct or misplaced) and introduces new high-value letters: U (vowel) and B, G (consonants).
- Goal: Narrow down possible positions for D and identify other letters.

<guess>budge</guess>",budge,"We have two guesses so far:
1. ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓) → E is in the word and at position 5. C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.
2. ""slide"": S(x), L(x), I(x), D(-), E(✓) → D is in the word but not at position 4. S, L, I are not in the word. E is confirmed at position 5.

From this feedback:
- E is fixed at position 5.
- D is in the word, but not at position 4.
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, S, L, I. (since they are marked with 'x')
- Therefore, the word has E in position 5 and contains D in a position other than 4.

Since D is marked with '-' for position 4 in ""slide"", D must be in one of the positions 1, 2, or 3. (Position 4 is wrong, and position 5 is E, so D could be at 1,2,3 but not 4 or 5).

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (position 5)
- Contains D (since D is confirmed present)
- Avoids C, R, A, N, S, L, I (as they are excluded)
- Uses only words with letters that are still possible.

Remaining letters: all letters except: C, R, A, N, S, L, I. But D and E are known; E fixed at end, D somewhere else.

The secret word has pattern: _ _ _ _ E
With D present, not at position 4.

Possible positions for D: 1, 2, or 3.

We need to include D in one of the first three positions in our next guess to test its placement and also test other new letters to narrow down possibilities.

Common letters not yet tested: T, O, U, M, P, B, G, F, H, K, V, W, Y, etc. Prioritize high-frequency letters: T, O, U, H, M, P.

Letter frequencies: T, O, H, M, P are good choices.

We must avoid S, L, I, C, R, A, N.

We know E is at 5, D is somewhere.

Next guess possibilities:

- The word must include D and E, with E at the end.
- D should be placed in position 1, 2, or 3 to check if it's correct elsewhere.

Since D is not at position 4, it might be at 1,2,3. By placing D in different positions, we can test.

But we need to guess a word that is valid and tests multiple new letters.

Options:

- If we put D at position 1: e.g., ""d__ _ e"" endings with E. Words like ""duple"", ""dunce"" but N excluded, not possible. ""duple"" D-U-P-L-E has L excluded. ""dowse"" has S, excluded. ""douse"" D-O-U-S-E, has S excluded. ""doubt"" doesn't end with E. ""dodge"" D-O-D-G-E, but G, and repeats D? Only one D so far we know.

We don't know if there are double D, but feedback didn't indicate anything so assume single for now.

Another word: ""dowle"" not common. ""dovie"" not word. ""dozed"" has Z, less common. So D at 1 might be hard with restrictions.

Put D at position 2: pattern ""_ d _ _ e"". Words like ""oxide"" O-X-I-D-E has I excluded. I is out. ""adept"" A excluded. ""udder"" not ends with E and has R excluded. ""udder"" is UDDER. ""added"" repeats D and not ends with E. ""abled"" A excluded. ""asked"" S and A excluded.

Perhaps ""older"" O-L-D-E-R has L and R excluded. Bad.

""udder"" no E.

Another: ""ampule"" not 5 letters.

This seems tricky.

Place D at position 3: pattern ""_ _ d _ e"". Words like ""budge"" B-U-D-G-E avoids excluded? B,U,D,G,E. All possible except need to check letters: U,G not tested, B not tested. ""guide"" G-U-I-D-E has I excluded.

I is out, so no.

""horde"" has R excluded.

""code"" is 4 letters.

""abode"" A excluded.

Maybe ""prude"" has R and P.

R excluded.

""trade"" T-R-A-D-E has R and A excluded.

Not possible.

Is ""budge"" a valid word? Budge - to move. Yes, 5-letter word.

Similarly, ""dodge"" D-O-D-G-E? O and G, D at 1 and 3? ""dodge"" has two D's? Actually, D O D G E, so positions 1:D, 2:O, 3:D, 4:G, 5:E. But from feedback, we know D is in the word, but not letter count yet; so double D might be possible? But in guess 2, D was at position 4, marked (-), meaning D is present but not at 4. If there is only one D, it can't be at 4, so it must be at 1,2,3. If there are two D, it could be, but we don't know.

But for guess, ""budge"" avoids excluded letters: B,U,D,G,E.

Similarly, ""fudge"" F-U-D-G-E, F not tested.

Another idea: since position 2 of ""slide"" is L(x), but D is somewhere, perhaps D is at position 1,2,3.

But let's list words ending with ""E"" containing ""D"", avoiding C,R,A,N,S,L,I.

For example: ""homed"" ends D.

""hoped"" ends D.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>First, the secret word is a 5-letter word, and I need to guess it in up to 6 tries. After my first guess ""crane"", I got feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), for N(x), and E(✓). That means E is in the word and in the correct position. Specifically, E is the last letter, position 5.

Feedback breakdown for ""crane"":

- C: x → not in the word

- R: x → not in the word

- A: x → not in the word

- N: x → not in the word

- E: ✓ → in word, correct position (position 5)

So, the secret word ends with E. Also, C, R, A, and N are not in the word at all.

Now, I need to make my second guess. Since E is fixed at the end, I should focus on finding other letters and their positions.

The secret word has E in position 5, and it does not contain C, R, A, or N.

I need to choose a word that has E at the end but avoids using C, R, A, N. Also, since position 5 is E, I should use a word that ends with E.

Common 5-letter words ending with E: there are many, like ""house"", ""price"", ""table"", ""blaze"", etc. But I need to avoid letters that are not in the secret word.

Letters to avoid: C, R, A, N are confirmed not in the word.

Also, since E is at position 5, and it's the only one I know, I should try to include common vowels and consonants that haven't been tested yet.

Untested letters: most of the alphabet except C, R, A, N, E. But E is in, just at position 5.

E is in the word, but I don't know about other positions for E yet, since only position 5 was correct. In fact, since all other positions got x for their letters, and E is ✓ only for position 5, it's possible that there are no other E's or if there are, they might be in different positions. But I have no information about that.

In feedback, for ""crane"", position 4 had N(x), which is x, meaning N is not in the word, but it says nothing about whether E could be elsewhere. Since E was position 5 and got ✓, it only confirms E is at 5. If there were another E, it might not be covered.

But in this case, I don't know yet.

To narrow down, I should use a word with E at the end and include other common letters.

Common letters in English: like S, T, L, O, U, I, D, H, etc.

Avoid C, R, A, N.

Also, the word must be valid, 5 letters.

Possible guess: for example, ""smile"" – S, M, I, L, E. E at end.

That avoids C, R, A, N.

""slide"" – S, L, I, D, E. Also avoids those letters.

""shade"" but A is already excluded, so ""shade"" has A, which is not allowed since A is not in the word. Feedback was A(x) for ""crane"", meaning A is not in the word at all.

Similarly, ""shape"" has A, not good.

""stone"" has O, T, N, E – but N is excluded, since N(x) in first guess.

N is not in the word, so ""stone"" has N, which is bad.

Similarly, I need a word without C, R, A, N.

So, letters to include: new letters, and E at position 5.

Let me list some words ending with E: aside, blaze, plume, guide, suite, pride, but PRIDE has R, excluded; suite has U, I, T, E.

SUITE: S, U, I, T, E.

S, U, I, T are untested.

SUITE is a word.

Other options: ""quite"" – Q, U, I, T, E. Q is less common.

""spite"" – S, P, I, T, E.

""white"" – W, H, I, T, E.

""write"" has R, excluded.

Since R is not in the word.

Perhaps ""house"" – H, O, U, S, E. But H, O, U, S untested.

""mouse"" similar.

I should aim for words with high-frequency letters to maximize information.

English letter frequency: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, etc.

But A, N, R are out; E is in at position 5.

So top untested: T, O, I, S, H, D, L, U, etc.

Better to include multiple of these.

A good word might be ""suite"" or ""spite"" or ""slide"".

""slide"" has S, L, I, D, E.

""store"" has R and O, T, E – but R excluded, so ""store"" has R, which is not good.

R is out, so avoid words with R.

Similarly, A and N out.

So ""slide"": positions: S1, L2, I3, D4, E5.

E is at 5, which is known, so I can use that.

Similarly, ""smile"": S1, M2, I3, L4, E5.

""shine"" has H, I, N, E – N excluded, so no.

""shine"" has N, which is x.

""prime"" has P, R, I, M, E – R excluded.

I think ""slide"" is a good candidate: common letters S, L, I, D.

""spite"" also: S, P, I, T, E – P and T are decent.

""house"": H, O, U, S, E – O, U common.

""guide"": G, U, I, D, E – G less common, but possible.

""louie"" not a word.

Quickly, let's choose ""slide"" or ""suite"".

I'll go with ""slide"" for now.

But D might not be high frequency; T is better.

""suite"" has T, which is common.

""Suite"" is S-U-I-T-E, valid word.

""Spine"" has N, excluded.

""Slime"" has L, I, M, E – S, L, I, M, E. M is fine.

But ""smile"" might be better? ""Smile"" S, M, I, L, E – positions: S1, M2, I3, L4, E5.

Since E is fixed at 5, I can think of testing other positions.

Perhaps to test different vowels, I used C R A N E first, vowels A and E; A is out, E in at 5.

So I should test other vowels: O, I, U.

For example, ""quite"" has I and U, or ""house"" has O and U.

""those"" but has H, O, E – E at 5, but T, H, O, S? ""those"" T-H-O-S-E, positions 1-5.

S is common.

To avoid less common letters.

Another strategic point: since I know E is last, I could try a word with E elsewhere to see if there are multiple E's, but in this case, position 5 is fixed, so if I put E in other positions, but since E is at 5, if I guess a word with E in position 4, for example, it might show if there is another E.

For instance, if I guess ""blame"", but A is out, not possible.

A is out.

Suppose I guess ""phone"", but N is out.

""trued"" not common.

Perhaps later; for now, I should focus on finding new letters.

I think ""slide"" is fine.

I'll choose ""slide"" as my second guess.

Guess: S L I D E

Positions: 1:S, 2:L, 3:I, 4:D, 5:E

E is fixed at 5, so D at 4 is new, etc.

After this, I will get feedback on S, L, I, D with respect to the secret word.

Feedback will tell me for each.

So, in response format: I need to think step by step in <think> and then provide the guess.

Thought process is above.

So for the guess itself:

<guess>slide</guess>

But let me confirm if there's a better word.

""stile"" S-T-I-L-E, but L and E; E at 5, T is good.

""Stile"" is a word, meaning a step or something.

""while"" has H, I, L, E – W, H, I, L, E; W and H.

Similarly, ""smile"" with M.

M is middling frequency.

Perhaps ""suite"" with T.

""Suite"" S-U-I-T-E.

U and T.

U is less frequent than T or S.

S is high frequency.

S, L, I, D in ""slide"" are all decent.

Another word: ""plume"" P-L-U-M-E, but U and P less common.

""shine"" not, N out.

I think ""slide"" is reasonable.

Or ""spite"" S-P-I-T-E.

P and T instead of L and D.

T is more common than L or D.

Letter frequency: E is most common, already known; then T, A (out), O, I, N (out), S, H, R (out), D, L, U.

So top untested: T, O, I, S, H, D, L.

A word that includes T, O, I, S would be good, but with E at end.

E.g., ""toise"" not a word.

""house"" has O, U, H, S, E.

""those"" T-H-O-S-E, has H, O, S, T.

""Those"" is good: T, H, O, S, E.

E at 5, and T, H, O, S are all common untested letters.

Compared to ""slide"" with S, L, I, D – I is vowel, D less common.

""those"" uses more high-frequency letters: T, O, S, H.

And avoids C,R,A,N.

Yes, ""those"" seems better.

T at position 1, H at 2, O at 3, S at 4, E at 5.

Now, since E is always at 5, I can test the other positions.

Secret word ends with E, and doesn't have C,R,A,N.

""those"" could be a good guess.

Other options like ""store"" but R is out.

""phone"" N out.

""shine"" N out.

""quite"" Q less common.

I think ""those"" is a solid choice.

So I'll go with ""those"" for my second guess.After the first guess ""crane"" with feedback showing E is correct and in position 5, and C, R, A, N are not in the word, I need to choose a second guess that maximizes information about the secret word.

- The secret word ends with E (position 5) and excludes C, R, A, N.
- I should target common untested letters to cover more possibilities. Based on English letter frequency, high-frequency letters not yet ruled out include T, O, I, S, H, L, D, U. Prioritizing T, O, S, and H is beneficial as they are among the most common.
- The word must be 5 letters, valid English, and avoid C, R, A, N while placing E at the end to confirm its position.
- Good candidates include ""those"" (T,H,O,S,E) or ""house"" (H,O,U,S,E), but ""those"" is preferable as it uses T and O (higher frequency than U) and S, H.
- ""those"" allows testing positions 1-4 with T, H, O, S, which can reveal correct letters and their placements.

<guess>slide</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: slide -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) I(x) D(-) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two guesses so far:
1. ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓) → E is in the word and at position 5. C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.
2. ""slide"": S(x), L(x), I(x), D(-), E(✓) → D is in the word but not at position 4. S, L, I are not in the word. E is confirmed at position 5.

From this feedback:
- E is fixed at position 5.
- D is in the word, but not at position 4.
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, S, L, I. (since they are marked with 'x')
- Therefore, the word has E in position 5 and contains D in a position other than 4.

Since D is marked with '-' for position 4 in ""slide"", D must be in one of the positions 1, 2, or 3. (Position 4 is wrong, and position 5 is E, so D could be at 1,2,3 but not 4 or 5).

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (position 5)
- Contains D (since D is confirmed present)
- Avoids C, R, A, N, S, L, I (as they are excluded)
- Uses only words with letters that are still possible.

Remaining letters: all letters except: C, R, A, N, S, L, I. But D and E are known; E fixed at end, D somewhere else.

The secret word has pattern: _ _ _ _ E
With D present, not at position 4.

Possible positions for D: 1, 2, or 3.

We need to include D in one of the first three positions in our next guess to test its placement and also test other new letters to narrow down possibilities.

Common letters not yet tested: T, O, U, M, P, B, G, F, H, K, V, W, Y, etc. Prioritize high-frequency letters: T, O, U, H, M, P.

Letter frequencies: T, O, H, M, P are good choices.

We must avoid S, L, I, C, R, A, N.

We know E is at 5, D is somewhere.

Next guess possibilities:

- The word must include D and E, with E at the end.
- D should be placed in position 1, 2, or 3 to check if it's correct elsewhere.

Since D is not at position 4, it might be at 1,2,3. By placing D in different positions, we can test.

But we need to guess a word that is valid and tests multiple new letters.

Options:

- If we put D at position 1: e.g., ""d__ _ e"" endings with E. Words like ""duple"", ""dunce"" but N excluded, not possible. ""duple"" D-U-P-L-E has L excluded. ""dowse"" has S, excluded. ""douse"" D-O-U-S-E, has S excluded. ""doubt"" doesn't end with E. ""dodge"" D-O-D-G-E, but G, and repeats D? Only one D so far we know.

We don't know if there are double D, but feedback didn't indicate anything so assume single for now.

Another word: ""dowle"" not common. ""dovie"" not word. ""dozed"" has Z, less common. So D at 1 might be hard with restrictions.

Put D at position 2: pattern ""_ d _ _ e"". Words like ""oxide"" O-X-I-D-E has I excluded. I is out. ""adept"" A excluded. ""udder"" not ends with E and has R excluded. ""udder"" is UDDER. ""added"" repeats D and not ends with E. ""abled"" A excluded. ""asked"" S and A excluded.

Perhaps ""older"" O-L-D-E-R has L and R excluded. Bad.

""udder"" no E.

Another: ""ampule"" not 5 letters.

This seems tricky.

Place D at position 3: pattern ""_ _ d _ e"". Words like ""budge"" B-U-D-G-E avoids excluded? B,U,D,G,E. All possible except need to check letters: U,G not tested, B not tested. ""guide"" G-U-I-D-E has I excluded.

I is out, so no.

""horde"" has R excluded.

""code"" is 4 letters.

""abode"" A excluded.

Maybe ""prude"" has R and P.

R excluded.

""trade"" T-R-A-D-E has R and A excluded.

Not possible.

Perhaps rethinking: D could be at position 1,2,3, but let's list possible words ending with E and containing D, avoiding S,L,I,C,R,A,N.

Available letters: D, E are known. Possible: B, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, T, U, V, W, Y, Z, etc.

Common words: ""moved"" M-O-V-E-D? But E is at position 5, so pattern _ _ _ _ E, not E at 4. ""moved"" ends with D, not E.

We need words ending with E.

""mode"" M-O-D-E: 4 letters.

5-letter words: ""glade"" A excluded. ""grade"" A and R excluded. ""blade"" A out. ""shade"" A out. ""spade"" A out. All have A.

""deuce"" D-E-U-C-E, C excluded and E at 1? Not ends E.

position: must end E.

Another word: ""dunce"" N out.

""dowse"" S out.

""douse"" S out.

""duple"" L out.

Perhaps ""above"" A out? ""above"" A-B-O-V-E has A, excluded.

Not.

""alive"" A and I out.

""olive"" I and L? L out? L is in ""slide"" L(x), so L is excluded.

In ""slide"", L(x), so L is not in word.

Similarly, S(x), I(x).

So back to square one.

But D must be in the word. So there are words.

For example, ""comet"" doesn't have D.

""depth"" no E.

Perhaps ""outed"" O-U-T-E-D ends with D, not E.

Need to end with E.

""oxide"" has I, excluded.

""pride"" R and I out.

""bride"" R and I out.

""slide"" already guessed, but S,L,I out.

Other words: ""guide"" has I.

""gouge"" no D and ends E.

""rouge"" no D.

""budge"" B-U-D-G-E? Positions: let's say B U D G E, so B1, U2, D3, G4, E5.

This avoids excluded letters: B,U,D,G,E. All not excluded yet.

Is ""budge"" a valid word? Budge - to move. Yes, 5-letter word.

Similarly, ""dodge"" D-O-D-G-E? O and G, D at 1 and 3? ""dodge"" has two D's? Actually, D O D G E, so positions 1:D, 2:O, 3:D, 4:G, 5:E. But from feedback, we know D is in the word, but not letter count yet; so double D might be possible? But in guess 2, D was at position 4, marked (-), meaning D is present but not at 4. If there is only one D, it can't be at 4, so it must be at 1,2,3. If there are two D, it could be, but we don't know.

But for guess, ""budge"" avoids excluded letters: B,U,D,G,E.

Similarly, ""fudge"" F-U-D-G-E, F not tested.

""judge"" J-U-D-G-E, J less common.

""nudge"" N out.

So ""budge"" is possible.

""purge"" no D.

Another word: ""plume"" P-L-U-M-E, L excluded.

""flume"" L and F? Positions F-L-U-M-E, L excluded.

Not.

""bunge"" not common.

""cagey"" no D.

With D at position 2: ""_ d _ _ e""

For instance, ""udden"" not word.

""addie"" not, and A,I excluded.

""oddly"" not ends E.

""model"" L excluded.

""modem"" ends M.

But we need to find words.

""padre"" A,R excluded.

Not possible.

With D at position 1 and other letters.

""dowve"" not word.

""douce"" C excluded.

""douse"" S out.

Perhaps ""debar"" no E.

Ending with E: ""addle"" A excluded and L. ""addle"" A-D-D-L-E, A and L excluded.

Bad.

""puddle"" too long.

5 letter: ""oxide"" I out.

""educe"" E-D-U-C-E C excluded.

Not.

""adobe"" A,O,B,E - A excluded.

Perhaps ""tawed"" ends D.

Not ending E.

Another idea: since position 2 of ""slide"" is L(x), but D is somewhere, perhaps D is at position 1,2,3.

But let's list words ending with ""E"" containing ""D"", avoiding C,R,A,N,S,L,I.

For example: ""homed"" ends D.

""hoped"" ends D.

Must eend with E, so ""home"" is 4.

5-letter words: ""named"" ends D, N,A? N and A excluded.

""faced"" C excluded.

""lived"" L,I out.

""moved"" ends D.

The secret word ends with E, so ""moved"" doesn't work.

Words like ""above"" have A.

Butter: ""butter"" not ends E.

Let's think: ""theme"" T-H-E-M-E? Positions: T1, H2, E3, M4, E5. But we know E is at position 5, so if there is E at position 3, it might be possible. In this case, ""theme"" has E at 3 and 5.

But from first guess ""crane"", position 3 was A(x), that doesn't say about E.

Position 3 in ""crane"" was A, x, so E could be at position 3 if it's in the word.

Similarly, in ""slide"", position 3 was I(x), so E could be elsewhere.

So ""theme"" is a possibility.

""theme"" : T,H,E,M,E. E at 3 and 5? Position 5 is E, position 3 is also E? But in feedback, for ""crane"", position 3 was A, marked x, which means A is not present, but doesn't imply anything about E at position 3. Similarly for ""slide"".

But in ""theme"", letters: T, H, E, M.

E is at position 3 and 5, but position 5 is already E, position 3 is also E. Is that allowed? Yes, if the word has multiple E's.

But we don't know.

""theme"" has E at position 3, but our known E is at position 5.

Now, for ""theme"" to be guessable, it must contain D? No, D is in the secret word, but it doesn't have to be in the guess. The guess can be any word, but to gather information, we should include D because we know it's present.

Since D is known to be in the word, not including D in the guess might waste an opportunity to verify its position.

So it's better to include D in the guess.

But ""theme"" does not have D.

Similarly, ""there"" T-H-E-R-E has R, excluded.

Not.

""where"" W-H-E-R-E has R and multiple E.

R out.

""these"" T-H-E-S-E has S and two E. S excluded.

Not.

So back to D.

Another word: ""dowel"" L and ends L.

Not ends E.

Perhaps ""baked"" ends D.

Not ends E.

I think ""budge"" might be a good choice: B-U-D-G-E, positions B1, U2, D3, G4, E5.

Or ""fudge"" F1 U2 D3 G4 E5.

Both feasible.

""judge"" J1 U2 D3 G4 E5.

J less common.

""dodge"" D1 O2 D3 G4 E5, with two D's.

But maybe ok.

Since in ""slide"", D was at position 4 and marked (-), meaning D is present but not at 4, so if I put D at position 3 in ""budge"", or position 1 in ""dodge"", etc.

Also, can test B, U, G or other letters.

Similarly, ""purde"" not word.

""goude"" not.

I'll go with ""budge"".

But let's see if there is a word with O, T, etc.

"" tode"" not 5.

""mode"" 4 letters.

"" douse"" S out.

"" dowie"" not word.

""howbe"" not.

Another common word: ""movie"" M-O-V-I-E but I excluded in ""slide"" feedback, I(x), so I is not in word.

I is out.

So avoid I.

""above"" A out.

""probe"" P-R-O-B-E has R excluded.

Not.

""grope"" R.

""grace"" C,R,A.

All bad.

""mo ped"" not.

Perhaps ""amped"" ends D, not E.

Word that works: ""vogue"" no D.

I think ""budge"" or ""fudge"" are options.

Let's choose ""budge"".

Or ""cadge"" C excluded.

""badge"" A out.

"" midge"" D? MIDGE has D? M-I-D-G-E, I excluded.

I out.

""bodge"" not common.

"" wodge"" not common.

"" fidge"" not.

So ""budge"" is acceptable.

"" nudge"" N out.

""smudge"" S out.

So yes, ""budge"".

Another possibility: ""g nowe"" not.

""thyme"" T-H-Y-M-E, but H and Y, E at 5.

But no D. We should include D.

""D must be in the secret word, so including it in the guess can help locate its position.

For the third guess, let's say ""budge"": B U D G E

Positions: 1:B, 2:U, 3:D, 4:G, 5:E

After this, feedback will tell us about B, U, D, G: if any are in and where.

D is at position 3; if it shows - or ✓, we know if it's at 3 or elsewhere.

Similarly for other letters.

So, guess: ""budge""

<guess>budge</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **First guess ""crane""**: E is in the word and in the correct position (5), while C, R, A, N are not in the word.
- **Second guess ""slide""**: E is confirmed at position 5, D is in the word but not at position 4, and S, L, I are not in the word.

**Key insights:**
- The secret word has E at position 5 and contains D somewhere, but not at position 4 (so D must be in position 1, 2, or 3).
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, S, L, I (all marked 'x').
- Untested high-frequency letters include T, O, U, M, P, B, G, F, H, K, V, W, Y. Prioritizing T, O, H, M, and P can maximize information.
- The guess must include D to test its position and avoid excluded letters. D should be placed in position 1, 2, or 3 based on possible word options.

**Choosing the third guess:**
- Options considered: 
  - ""budge"" (B, U, D, G, E) – Tests B, U, D (at position 3), G, with E at position 5. Avoids excluded letters and uses common untested consonants (B, G) and a vowel (U).
  - Other words like ""fudge"" or ""judge"" were less ideal due to lower letter frequency (""J"") or redundancy (""F"" similar frequency to ""B"").
- ""budge"" efficiently tests D at position 3 (could reveal if correct or misplaced) and introduces new high-value letters: U (vowel) and B, G (consonants).
- Goal: Narrow down possible positions for D and identify other letters.

After my first guess ""crane"", I got feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), for N(x), and E(✓). That means E is in the word and in the correct position. Specifically, E is the last letter, position 5.\n\nFeedback breakdown for ""crane"":\n\n- C: x → not in the word\n\n- R: x → not in the word\n\n- A: x → not in the word\n\n- N: x → not in the word\n\n- E: ✓ → in word, correct position (position 5)\n\nSo, the secret word ends with E. Also, C, R, A, and N are not in the word at all.\n\nNow, I need to make my second guess. Since E is fixed at the end, I should focus on finding other letters and their positions.\n\nThe secret word has E in position 5, and it does not contain C, R, A, or N.\n\nI need to choose a word that has E at the end but avoids using C, R, A, N. Also, since position 5 is E, I should use a word that ends with E.\n\nCommon 5-letter words ending with E: there are many, like ""house"", ""price"", ""table"", ""blaze"", etc. But I need to avoid letters that are not in the secret word.\n\nLetters to avoid: C, R, A, N are confirmed not in the word.\n\nAlso, since E is at position 5, and it\'s the only one I know, I should try to include common vowels and consonants that haven\'t been tested yet.\n\nUntested letters: most of the alphabet except C, R, A, N, E. But E is in, just at position 5.\n\nE is in the word, but I don\'t know about other positions for E yet, since only position 5 was correct. In fact, since all other positions got x for their letters, and E is ✓ only for position 5, it\'s possible that there are no other E\'s or if there are, they might be in different positions. But I have no information about that.\n\nIn feedback, for ""crane"", position 4 had N(x), which is x, meaning N is not in the word, but it says nothing about whether E could be elsewhere. Since E was position 5 and got ✓, it only confirms E is at 5. If there were another E, it might not be covered.\n\nBut in this case, I don\'t know yet.\n\nTo narrow down, I should use a word with E at the end and include other common letters.\n\nCommon letters in English: like S, T, L, O, U, I, D, H, etc.\n\nAvoid C, R, A, N.\n\nAlso, the word must be valid, 5 letters.\n\nPossible guess: for example, ""smile"" – S, M, I, L, E. E at end.\n\nThat avoids C, R, A, N.\n\n""slide"" – S, L, I, D, E. Also avoids those letters.\n\n""shade"" but A is already excluded, so ""shade"" has A, which is not allowed since A is not in the word.

""Smile"" S, M, I, L, E – positions: S1, M2, I3, L4, E5.\n\nSince E is fixed at 5, I can think of testing other positions.\n\nPerhaps to test different vowels, I used C R A N E first, vowels A and E; A is out, E in at 5.\n\nSo I should test other vowels: O, I, U.\n\nFor example, ""quite"" has I and U, or ""house"" has O and U.\n\n""those"" but has H, O, E – E at 5, but T, H, O, S? ""those"" T-H-O-S-E, positions 1-5.\n\nS is common.\n\nTo avoid less common letters.\n\nAnother strategic point: since I know E is last, I could try a word with E elsewhere to see if there are multiple E\'s, but in this case, position 5 is fixed, so if I put E in other positions, but since E is at 5, if I guess a word with E in position 4, for example, it might show if there is another E.\n\nFor instance, if I guess ""blame"", but A is out, not possible.\n\nA is out.\n\nSuppose I guess ""phone"", but N is out.\n\n""trued"" not common.\n\nPerhaps later; for now, I should focus on finding new letters.\n\nI think ""slide"" is fine.\n\nI\'ll choose ""slide"" as my second guess.\n\nGuess: S L I D E\n\nPositions: 1:S, 2:L, 3:I, 4:D, 5:E\n\nE is fixed at 5, so D at 4 is new, etc.\n\nAfter this, I will get feedback on S, L, I, D with respect to the secret word.\n\nFeedback will tell me for each.\n\nSo, in response format: I need to think step by step in <think> and then provide the guess.\n\nThought process is above.\n\nSo for the guess itself:\n\n<guess>slide</guess>\n\nBut let me confirm if there\'s a better word.\n\n""stile"" S-T-I-L-E, but L and E; E at 5, T is good.\n\n""Stile"" is a word, meaning a step or something.\n\n""while"" has H, I, L, E – W, H, I, L, E; W and H.\n\nSimilarly, ""smile"" with M.\n\nM is middling frequency.\n\nPerhaps ""suite"" with T.\n\n""Suite"" S-U-I-T-E.\n\nU and T.\n\nU is less frequent than T or S.\n\nS is high frequency.\n\nS, L, I, D in ""slide"" are all decent.\n\nAnother word: ""plume"" P-L-U-M-E, but U and P less common.\n\n""shine"" not, N out.\n\nI think ""slide"" is reasonable.\n\nOr ""spite"" S-P-I-T-E.\n\nP and T instead of L and D.\n\nT is more common than L or D.\n\nLetter frequency: E is most common, already known; then T, A (out), O, I, N (out), S, H, R (out), D, L, U.\n\nSo top untested: T, O, I, S, H, D, L.\n\nA word that includes T, O, I, S would be good, but with E at end.\n\nE.g., ""toise"" not a word.\n\n""house"" has O, U, H, S, E.\n\n""those"" T-H-O-S-E, has H, O, S, T.\n\n""Those"" is good: T, H, O, S, E.\n\nE at 5, and T, H, O, S are all common untested letters.\n\nCompared to ""slide"" with S, L, I, D – I is vowel, D less common.\n\n""those"" uses more high-frequency letters: T, O, S, H.\n\nAnd avoids C,R,A,N.\n\nYes, ""those"" seems better.\n\nT at position 1, H at 2, O at 3, S at 4, E at 5.\n\nNow, since E is always at 5, I can test the other positions.\n\nSecret word ends with E, and doesn\'t have C,R,A,N.\n\n""those"" could be a good guess.\n\nOther options like ""store"" but R is out.\n\n""phone"" N out.\n\n""shine"" N out.\n\n""quite"" Q less common.\n\nI think ""those"" is a solid choice.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""those"" for my second guess.After the first guess ""crane"" with feedback showing E is correct and in position 5, and C, R, A, N are not in the word, I need to choose a second guess that maximizes information about the secret word.\n\n- The secret word ends with E (position 5) and excludes C, R, A, N.\n- I should target common untested letters to cover more possibilities. Based on English letter frequency, high-frequency letters not yet ruled out include T, O, I, S, H, L, D, U. Prioritizing T, O, S, and H is beneficial as they are among the most common.\n- The word must be 5 letters, valid English, and avoid C, R, A, N while placing E at the end to confirm its position.\n- Good candidates include ""those"" (T,H,O,S,E) or ""house"" (H,O,U,S,E), but ""those"" is preferable as it uses T and O (higher frequency than U) and S, H.\n- ""those"" allows testing positions 1-4 with T, H, O, S, which can reveal correct letters and their placements.\n\n<guess>slide</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: slide -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) I(x) D(-) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two guesses so far:\n1.

In this case, ""theme"" has E at 3 and 5.\n\nBut from first guess ""crane"", position 3 was A(x), that doesn\'t say about E.\n\nPosition 3 in ""crane"" was A, x, so E could be at position 3 if it\'s in the word.\n\nSimilarly, in ""slide"", position 3 was I(x), so E could be elsewhere.\n\nSo ""theme"" is a possibility.\n\n""theme"" : T,H,E,M,E. E at 3 and 5? Position 5 is E, position 3 is also E? But in feedback, for ""crane"", position 3 was A, marked x, which means A is not present, but doesn\'t imply anything about E at position 3. Similarly for ""slide"".\n\nBut in ""theme"", letters: T, H, E, M.\n\nE is at position 3 and 5, but position 5 is already E, position 3 is also E. Is that allowed? Yes, if the word has multiple E\'s.\n\nBut we don\'t know.\n\n""theme"" has E at position 3, but our known E is at position 5.\n\nNow, for ""theme"" to be guessable, it must contain D? No, D is in the secret word, but it doesn\'t have to be in the guess. The guess can be any word, but to gather information, we should include D because we know it\'s present.\n\nSince D is known to be in the word, not including D in the guess might waste an opportunity to verify its position.\n\nSo it\'s better to include D in the guess.\n\nBut ""theme"" does not have D.\n\nSimilarly, ""there"" T-H-E-R-E has R, excluded.\n\nNot.\n\n""where"" W-H-E-R-E has R and multiple E.\n\nR out.\n\n""these"" T-H-E-S-E has S and two E.

We are given feedback from three guesses:

1. ""crane"" -> C not in word, R not in word, A not in word, N not in word, E is in word and in correct position (5).
2. ""slide"" -> S not in word, L not in word, I not in word, D is in word but not in position 4, E is in word and in correct position (5).
3. ""budge"" -> B not in word, U not in word, D is in word and in correct position (3)? Let's see: D(✓) meaning D is correct at position 3? And G(✓) meaning G is correct at position 4? And E(✓) at position 5.

Wait, in ""budge"": positions are B:1, U:2, D:3, G:4, E:5.
Feedback: B(x) => B not in word.
U(x) => U not in word.
D(✓) => D is in word and at correct position 3? Or does the ✓ mean that D is at the correct position? Yes, by the rules: ✓ means the letter is in the word and in the correct position.
Similarly, G(✓) => G is in the word and in correct position (position 4 in the guess, which is position 4 in the word? Since it's ✓, it should be at the right position.

And E(✓) at position 5.

So, from ""budge"" feedback:
- B(x): B not in word.
- U(x): U not in word.
- D(✓): D is in word and in position 3.
- G(✓): G is in word and in position 4.
- E(✓): E in word and in position 5.

Therefore, we know:
- Position 3 must be D.
- Position 4 must be G.
- Position 5 must be E.

So the secret word has at least: _ _ D G E

Additionally, from previous feedback:
- Position 5 is E (already known).
- D is at position 3 (as per this ✓).
- And G at position 4.

Also, excluded letters so far:
- From guess1: C, R, A, N
- From guess2: S, L, I
- From guess3: B, U

So excluded: C, R, A, N, S, L, I, B, U.

Now, we only need to find positions 1 and 2.

Known pattern: ? ? D G E

Letters we are missing: two letters at positions 1 and 2. They could be the same letter? But double letters possible.

The secret word must be a 5-letter word with known positions 3:D, 4:G, 5:E.

We need to choose letters for positions 1 and 2, avoiding excluded letters.

Also, from guess2, D was marked as (-) meaning D was in the word but not at position 4. But now we know D is at position 3, so that matches.

Now, for positions 1 and 2, we have to find letters that form a valid word.

Possible letters not excluded: remaining letters: F, H, K, M, O, P, T, V, W, Y, etc. (anything not C,R,A,N,S,L,I,B,U)

Also, E is only known at position 5, so if there is another E, but let's see.

Common words ending with ""DGE"" after two letters.

Pattern: __DGE

Words like ""badge"" but B excluded and A? A also excluded.

""cadge"" but C excluded.

""fadge""? Not common word.

""gadge"" not word.

""hadj"" not.

But we have pattern: first two letters must be from available letters.

Examples: ""midge"" would be M I D G E, but I is excluded (from guess2).

""ridge"" R excluded.

""hodge"" H O D G E? H-O-D-G-E? Oh, ""hodge"" can be a name or part of hodgepodge, but let's see if valid.

Similarly, ""lodge"" L excluded.

""judge"" J and U? U excluded.

""budge"" already guessed.

""nudge"" N excluded.

""fudge"" F U D G E but U excluded.

U is out.

""pudge"" P U D G E U excluded.

Not.

""smudge"" S excluded.

""trudge"" T R U D G E, R excluded.

Not.

""wodge"" W O D G E? Is ""wodge"" a word? Sometimes, meaning a chunk.

""dodge"" D O D G E, but here position 1 would be D, but position 3 is also D? And O at position 2.

""dodge"" has D at 1 and 3.

But we know position 3 is D, so if ""dodge"", then position 1 is D? But let's see feedback.

In previous, we have excluded letters, but D is in the word at position 3. If D is also at position 1, that might be possible? Since not excluded.

But let's check the word ""dodge"": D-O-D-G-E.

Positions: 1:D, 2:O, 3:D, 4:G, 5:E.

We know position 3 is D, position 4 is G, position 5 is E. So if secret word is ""dodge"", then:

- Position 1: D -> but is this allowed? We have no information against D at position 1 yet.

Similarly, position 3: D, which we know.

G at 4, E at 5.

But in guess ""budge"", we had D at position 3 marked ✓, but that doesn't say about position 1.

Similarly, excluded letters don't include D elsewhere.

But from feedback of ""slide"", D was marked (-) at position 4, meaning D is in word but not at 4, which is consistent.

In ""slide"", D was guessed at position 4 and was wrong position, but correct letter.

Now, if D is at position 3 and perhaps 1, it could be.

But let's see alternative words.

Another word: ""hedge"" H E D G E? Positions: H1, E2, D3, G4, E5.

E at position 2? But we know position 5 is E; this has E at 2 and 5.

Is that allowed? Yes.

Similarly, ""wedge"" W E D G E? E at position 2.

""fidge"" not common.

""midge"" I excluded.

""budge"" already guessed.

So, available: ""hedge"" H-E-D-G-E, ""wedge"" W-E-D-G-E, ""dodge"" D-O-D-G-E, ""wodge"" W-O-D-G-E, ""fledge"" too long, ""pledge"" P-L-E-D-G-E has L excluded.

"" trudge"" R excluded.

So possible words: ""hedge"", ""wedge"", ""dodge"", ""wodge"", etc.

But we need to see which are valid.

Also, ""cadge"" C out, ""badge"" B out, etc.

Now, from feedback, we have not tested letters like H,W,O,P,T,M,K,V,F,Y.

For positions 1 and 2.

In ""hedge"", position 1: H, position 2: E.

E? But E is at position 5; could E be at position 2? Yes.

Similarly, in ""wedge"", position 1:W, position 2:E.

In ""dodge"", position 1:D, position 2:O.

In ""wodge"", position 1:W, position 2:O.

Also, ""hedge"" has two E's.

To distinguish, we need to guess a word that tests these.

But the pattern is fixed: positions 3:D,4:G,5:E. So the first two letters define the word.

We have limited possibilities: let's list common words:

- ""hedge"": H and E at positions 1 and 2? Positions: 1:H, 2:E, 3:D,4:G,5:E.

But position 2 is E? Then there are two E's.

Similarly, ""wedge"": 1:W,2:E,3:D,4:G,5:E

""pledge"" is 6 letters? No, pledge is 6? P-L-E-D-G-E is 6 letters. Oh, 6 positions. Mistake.

""ledge"" L-E-D-G-E but L excluded.

""hedge"" is H,E,D,G,E - that's 5 letters.

""hedge"" - valid.

Similarly, ""wedge"" - W,E,D,G,E - 5 letters.

""dodge"" - D,O,D,G,E - 5 letters.

""wodge"" - W,O,D,G,E - 5 letters, meaning a thick slice or lump.

Also, ""fudge"" but U excluded? ""fudge"" F,U,D,G,E - U excluded? U is out from guess3.

Guess3 ""budge"": U(x), so U not in word, so ""fudge"" has U, which is excluded, not allowed.

Similarly, ""judge"" has U? No, ""judge"" J,U,D,G,E - U excluded.

""midge"" has I, excluded.

So only possibilities: ""hedge"", ""wedge"", ""dodge"", ""wodge"", and perhaps ""madge"" not word, ""padge"" not.

That's about it.

Now, to guess the fourth word, we could guess one of these.

But only 6 tries, and we have information.

Already positions 3,4,5 known.

If we guess ""hedge"", for example.

But let's see efficient way.

Since positions 3,4,5 are fixed, we can try to guess which one it is by testing position 1 and 2.

But in the guess, our word must end with DGE, so it has to be one of these.

We can directly guess, say, ""hedge"" to see.

But if ""hedge"" is not correct, we learn H and E at 2 are not correct, etc.

Similarly.

Another idea: we can guess a word that may not be DGE ending but tests position 1 and 2 independently.

But that might not be necessary since we know the word must end with DGE, so position 1 and 2 are the only unknowns.

Therefore, the secret word is one of ""hedge"", ""wedge"", ""dodge"", ""wodge"".

Now, from excluded letters, we can eliminate?

For example, ""hedge"" has H at 1 and E at 2.

""wedge"" has W at 1 and E at 2.

""dodge"" has D at 1 and O at 2.

""wodge"" has W at 1 and O at 2.

Now, previously, E is known at position 5. Could E be at position 2? We have no information against it.

Similarly, O and W not tested.

In guess1 ""crane"", position 2 was R(x), so position 2 was not R, but we don't know what it is.

To test efficiently, since we have 4 options, we can guess one that covers common letters.

But all different.

Perhaps we can guess a word that uses O or W to see if they are in the word.

But the guess must be a valid word including positions 1 and 2.

Since we have to guess a 5-letter word, and we know last three are DGE, we can guess any word? But to maximize information, better to guess one of the possibilities.

For fourth guess, let's choose ""hedge"".

Guess: H E D G E

But positions: 1:H, 2:E, 3:D,4:G,5:E

But position 3:D we know is correct, position 4:G correct, position 5:E correct. So for position 2:E, it might be E or not.

Similarly.

After feedback, we will know.

If we guess ""dodge"", then if position 1:D is correct or not.

Since we have only few, guess one.

But note that in ""hedge"", position 2 is E, while in others not necessarily E.

Similarly.

Let's look back at feedback.

In guess2: ""slide"" had D at position 4 marked (-), meaning D is present but not at 4, which is consistent.

Similarly, no other constraints.

Now, probability: ""hedge"" might be common, ""wedge"" common, ""dodge"" common, ""wodge"" less common.

Also, is ""wodge"" acceptable? Sometimes.

To be safe, guess ""hedge"" or ""wedge"".

But let's choose ""hedge"" for the fourth guess.

Then, if correct, we win; if not, we get feedback.

For example, if secret is ""wedge"" and we guess ""hedge"", feedback would show E at position 2? Position 2 guess E, if secret ""wedge"" has E at position 2, then ✓ for E at position 2? But let's simulate.

Secret word: unknown, say one of them.

Guess ""hedge"": 

- Position 1: H. If secret is ""hedge"", then H(✓). If secret is ""wedge"", H not in word? Then H(x). Similarly.
- Position 2: E. If secret has E at position 2, then ✓; if not, but E is in word (since position 5 E), but E at position 2 is wrong? Then - ? No, if E is at position 2 in secret or not.

By rules:
- If the secret has E at position 2, then ✓
- If secret has E but not at position 2 (e.g., only at position 5), then E at position 2 would be - (since another E)
- But in secret word, E is at position 5; if there is another E at position 2, for ""hedge"" and ""wedge"", but ""dodge"" has O at 2, no E; ""wodge"" has O at 2, no E.

So for secret ""dodge"": positions 1:D, 2:O, 3:D,4:G,5:E

Guess ""hedge"": 
- Position 1: H vs D. D is not H, and H not in any position? Since secret ""dodge"" has no H, so H(x).
- Position 2: E vs O. O is not E, and E is in word but at position 5, not 2. So E at position 2 should be marked as -? Because E is in the word but wrong position? But position 5 is E, so E is definitely in the word. E at guess position 2 is not correct if secret position 2 is O. Therefore, since E is in word (at position 5), but not at position 2, it should be marked with '-' meaning present but wrong position. However, the symbol might vary, but by rules: ✓ correct position, - in word wrong position, x not in word.

So for E at position 2 in guess, when secret is ""dodge"" (no E at 2), but E is in secret at position 5, so - indeed.

Similarly, position 3:D correct, ✓; position 4:G correct, ✓; position 5:E correct, ✓.

Then the letter E at position 2 would be marked - because it's in the word but wrong position.

Similarly, if secret is ""hedge"", position 2 E would be ✓.

So we can tell from the feedback on position 2.

Similarly for position 1.

But let's not overcomplicate; we can guess ""hedge"" now.

So for the fourth guess: hedge

<guess>hedge</guess>But let's think if we can use a word that doesn't necessarily end with DGE but tests letters, but since we know last three must be DGE, it's fixed. So guessing any other word might waste letters.

So better to guess one of the candidates.
</think>
### Step-by-Step Thought Process
- **Known Information from Previous Feedback:**
  - From **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: 
    - C, R, A, N are not in the word (all marked ""x"").
    - E is in the word and correctly at position 5 (marked ""✓"").
  - From **Guess 2 (""slide"")**:
    - S, L, I are not in the word (all marked ""x"").
    - D is in the word but not at position 4 (marked ""-"").
    - E is confirmed at position 5 (marked ""✓"").
  - From **Guess 3 (""budge"")**:
    - B and U are not in the word (both marked ""x"").
    - D is in the word and correctly at position 3 (marked ""✓"").
    - G is in the word and correctly at position 4 (marked ""✓"").
    - E is confirmed at position 5 (marked ""✓"").
- **Current Word Structure:**  
  Combining all feedback:
  - Positions 3, 4, and 5 are fixed: position 3 must be D, position 4 must be G, and position 5 must be E.
  - Therefore, the secret word has the pattern: `_ _ D G E`.
  - Only positions 1 and 2 are unknown.
- **Excluded Letters:**  
  Letters ruled out from all guesses: C, R, A, N, S, L, I, B, U. These cannot appear anywhere in the word.
- **Remaining Letters:**  
  Possible letters for positions 1 and 2 come from the remaining alphabet: F, H, K, M, O, P, T, V, W, Y, etc. (any letter not excluded). High-frequency options include H, O, P, T, W.
- **Possible Word Candidates:**  
  The secret word must match `_ _ D G E`. Valid English words fitting this pattern:
  - ""hedge"": H at position 1, E at position 2.
  - ""wedge"": W at position 1, E at position 2.
  - ""dodge"": D at position 1, O at position 2 (if double D is allowed, not ruled out by feedback).
  - ""wodge"": W at position 1, O at position 2 (less common, but possible).
- **Choosing the Guess:**  
  - The goal is to test positions 1 and 2 efficiently. Guessing one of these candidates directly can solve the word or provide critical feedback to refine further guesses.
  - ""hedge"" is a strong choice for the next guess because:
    - It covers common letters (H and E at position 2).
    - E at position 2 is testable—if it gets ""✓"", it confirms both position and letter; if ""-"", it confirms E is in the word (already known) but wrong position; if ""x"", it rules out E at position 2.
    - H is a high-frequency consonant to test for position 1.
    - If ""hedge"" is correct, the game ends. If not, feedback will reduce possibilities quickly (e.g., ""wedge"" or ""dodge"" become more likely based on the response).
- **Why Not Other Words?**  
  Guessing a word that doesn't end with ""DGE"" might waste the chance to confirm the fixed positions, as the ending is already known. Prioritizing candidates maximizes progress with minimal risk.

<guess>hedge</guess>",hedge,"We are given feedback from three guesses:

1. ""crane"" -> C not in word, R not in word, A not in word, N not in word, E is in word and in correct position (5).
2. ""slide"" -> S not in word, L not in word, I not in word, D is in word but not in position 4, E is in word and in correct position (5).
3. ""budge"" -> B not in word, U not in word, D is in word and in correct position (3)? Let's see: D(✓) meaning D is correct at position 3? And G(✓) meaning G is correct at position 4? And E(✓) at position 5.

Wait, in ""budge"": positions are B:1, U:2, D:3, G:4, E:5.
Feedback: B(x) => B not in word.
U(x) => U not in word.
D(✓) => D is in word and at correct position 3? Or does the ✓ mean that D is at the correct position? Yes, by the rules: ✓ means the letter is in the word and in the correct position.
Similarly, G(✓) => G is in the word and in correct position (position 4 in the guess, which is position 4 in the word? Since it's ✓, it should be at the right position.

And E(✓) at position 5.

So, from ""budge"" feedback:
- B(x): B not in word.
- U(x): U not in word.
- D(✓): D is in word and in position 3.
- G(✓): G is in word and in position 4.
- E(✓): E in word and in position 5.

Therefore, we know:
- Position 3 must be D.
- Position 4 must be G.
- Position 5 must be E.

So the secret word has at least: _ _ D G E

Additionally, from previous feedback:
- Position 5 is E (already known).
- D is at position 3 (as per this ✓).
- And G at position 4.

Also, excluded letters so far:
- From guess1: C, R, A, N
- From guess2: S, L, I
- From guess3: B, U

So excluded: C, R, A, N, S, L, I, B, U.

Now, we only need to find positions 1 and 2.

Known pattern: ? ? D G E

Letters we are missing: two letters at positions 1 and 2. They could be the same letter? But double letters possible.

The secret word must be a 5-letter word with known positions 3:D, 4:G, 5:E.

We need to choose letters for positions 1 and 2, avoiding excluded letters.

Also, from guess2, D was marked as (-) meaning D was in the word but not at position 4. But now we know D is at position 3, so that matches.

Now, for positions 1 and 2, we have to find letters that form a valid word.

Possible letters not excluded: remaining letters: F, H, K, M, O, P, T, V, W, Y, etc. (anything not C,R,A,N,S,L,I,B,U)

Also, E is only known at position 5, so if there is another E, but let's see.

Common words ending with ""DGE"" after two letters.

Pattern: __DGE

Words like ""badge"" but B excluded and A? A also excluded.

""cadge"" but C excluded.

""fadge""? Not common word.

""gadge"" not word.

""hadj"" not.

But we have pattern: first two letters must be from available letters.

Examples: ""midge"" would be M I D G E, but I is excluded (from guess2).

""ridge"" R excluded.

""hodge"" H O D G E? H-O-D-G-E? Oh, ""hodge"" can be a name or part of hodgepodge, but let's see if valid.

Similarly, ""lodge"" L excluded.

""judge"" J and U? U excluded.

""budge"" already guessed.

""nudge"" N excluded.

""fudge"" F U D G E but U excluded.

U is out.

""pudge"" P U D G E U excluded.

Not.

""smudge"" S excluded.

""trudge"" T R U D G E, R excluded.

Not.

""wodge"" W O D G E? Is ""wodge"" a word? Sometimes, meaning a chunk.

""dodge"" D O D G E, but here position 1 would be D, but position 3 is also D? And O at position 2.

""dodge"" has D at 1 and 3.

But we know position 3 is D, so if ""dodge"", then position 1 is D? But let's see feedback.

In previous, we have excluded letters, but D is in the word at position 3. If D is also at position 1, that might be possible? Since not excluded.

But let's check the word ""dodge"": D-O-D-G-E.

Positions: 1:D, 2:O, 3:D, 4:G, 5:E.

We know position 3 is D, position 4 is G, position 5 is E. So if secret word is ""dodge"", then:

- Position 1: D -> but is this allowed? We have no information against D at position 1 yet.

Similarly, position 3: D, which we know.

G at 4, E at 5.

But in guess ""budge"", we had D at position 3 marked ✓, but that doesn't say about position 1.

Similarly, excluded letters don't include D elsewhere.

But from feedback of ""slide"", D was marked (-) at position 4, meaning D is in word but not at 4, which is consistent.

In ""slide"", D was guessed at position 4 and was wrong position, but correct letter.

Now, if D is at position 3 and perhaps 1, it could be.

But let's see alternative words.

Another word: ""hedge"" H E D G E? Positions: H1, E2, D3, G4, E5.

E at position 2? But we know position 5 is E; this has E at 2 and 5.

Is that allowed? Yes.

Similarly, ""wedge"" W E D G E? E at position 2.

""fidge"" not common.

""midge"" I excluded.

""budge"" already guessed.

So, available: ""hedge"" H-E-D-G-E, ""wedge"" W-E-D-G-E, ""dodge"" D-O-D-G-E, ""wodge"" W-O-D-G-E, ""fledge"" too long, ""pledge"" P-L-E-D-G-E has L excluded.

"" trudge"" R excluded.

So possible words: ""hedge"", ""wedge"", ""dodge"", ""wodge"", etc.

But we need to see which are valid.

Also, ""cadge"" C out, ""badge"" B out, etc.

Now, from feedback, we have not tested letters like H,W,O,P,T,M,K,V,F,Y.

For positions 1 and 2.

In ""hedge"", position 1: H, position 2: E.

E? But E is at position 5; could E be at position 2? Yes.

Similarly, in ""wedge"", position 1:W, position 2:E.

In ""dodge"", position 1:D, position 2:O.

In ""wodge"", position 1:W, position 2:O.

Also, ""hedge"" has two E's.

To distinguish, we need to guess a word that tests these.

But the pattern is fixed: positions 3:D,4:G,5:E. So the first two letters define the word.

We have limited possibilities: let's list common words:

- ""hedge"": H and E at positions 1 and 2? Positions: 1:H, 2:E, 3:D,4:G,5:E.

But position 2 is E? Then there are two E's.

Similarly, ""wedge"": 1:W,2:E,3:D,4:G,5:E

""pledge"" is 6 letters? No, pledge is 6? P-L-E-D-G-E is 6 letters. Oh, 6 positions. Mistake.

""ledge"" L-E-D-G-E but L excluded.

""hedge"" is H,E,D,G,E - that's 5 letters.

""hedge"" - valid.

Similarly, ""wedge"" - W,E,D,G,E - 5 letters.

""dodge"" - D,O,D,G,E - 5 letters.

""wodge"" - W,O,D,G,E - 5 letters, meaning a thick slice or lump.

Also, ""fudge"" but U excluded? ""fudge"" F,U,D,G,E - U excluded? U is out from guess3.

Guess3 ""budge"": U(x), so U not in word, so ""fudge"" has U, which is excluded, not allowed.

Similarly, ""judge"" has U? No, ""judge"" J,U,D,G,E - U excluded.

""midge"" has I, excluded.

So only possibilities: ""hedge"", ""wedge"", ""dodge"", ""wodge"", and perhaps ""madge"" not word, ""padge"" not.

That's about it.

Now, to guess the fourth word, we could guess one of these.

But only 6 tries, and we have information.

Already positions 3,4,5 known.

If we guess ""hedge"", for example.

But let's see efficient way.

Since positions 3,4,5 are fixed, we can try to guess which one it is by testing position 1 and 2.

But in the guess, our word must end with DGE, so it has to be one of these.

We can directly guess, say, ""hedge"" to see.

But if ""hedge"" is not correct, we learn H and E at 2 are not correct, etc.

Similarly.

Another idea: we can guess a word that may not be DGE ending but tests position 1 and 2 independently.

But that might not be necessary since we know the word must end with DGE, so position 1 and 2 are the only unknowns.

Therefore, the secret word is one of ""hedge"", ""wedge"", ""dodge"", ""wodge"".

Now, from excluded letters, we can eliminate?

For example, ""hedge"" has H at 1 and E at 2.

""wedge"" has W at 1 and E at 2.

""dodge"" has D at 1 and O at 2.

""wodge"" has W at 1 and O at 2.

Now, previously, E is known at position 5. Could E be at position 2? We have no information against it.

Similarly, O and W not tested.

In guess1 ""crane"", position 2 was R(x), so position 2 was not R, but we don't know what it is.

To test efficiently, since we have 4 options, we can guess one that covers common letters.

But all different.

Perhaps we can guess a word that uses O or W to see if they are in the word.

But the guess must be a valid word including positions 1 and 2.

Since we have to guess a 5-letter word, and we know last three are DGE, we can guess any word? But to maximize information, better to guess one of the possibilities.

For fourth guess, let's choose ""hedge"".

Guess: H E D G E

But positions: 1:H, 2:E, 3:D,4:G,5:E

But position 3:D we know is correct, position 4:G correct, position 5:E correct. So for position 2:E, it might be E or not.

Similarly.

After feedback, we will know.

If we guess ""dodge"", then if position 1:D is correct or not.

Since we have only few, guess one.

But note that in ""hedge"", position 2 is E, while in others not necessarily E.

Similarly.

Let's look back at feedback.

In guess2: ""slide"" had D at position 4 marked (-), meaning D is present but not at 4, which is consistent.

Similarly, no other constraints.

Now, probability: ""hedge"" might be common, ""wedge"" common, ""dodge"" common, ""wodge"" less common.

Also, is ""wodge"" acceptable? Sometimes.

To be safe, guess ""hedge"" or ""wedge"".

But let's choose ""hedge"" for the fourth guess.

Then, if correct, we win; if not, we get feedback.

For example, if secret is ""wedge"" and we guess ""hedge"", feedback would show E at position 2? Position 2 guess E, if secret ""wedge"" has E at position 2, then ✓ for E at position 2? But let's simulate.

Secret word: unknown, say one of them.

Guess ""hedge"": 

- Position 1: H. If secret is ""hedge"", then H(✓). If secret is ""wedge"", H not in word? Then H(x). Similarly.
- Position 2: E. If secret has E at position 2, then ✓; if not, but E is in word (since position 5 E), but E at position 2 is wrong? Then - ? No, if E is at position 2 in secret or not.

By rules:
- If the secret has E at position 2, then ✓
- If secret has E but not at position 2 (e.g., only at position 5), then E at position 2 would be - (since another E)
- But in secret word, E is at position 5; if there is another E at position 2, for ""hedge"" and ""wedge"", but ""dodge"" has O at 2, no E; ""wodge"" has O at 2, no E.

So for secret ""dodge"": positions 1:D, 2:O, 3:D,4:G,5:E

Guess ""hedge"": 
- Position 1: H vs D. D is not H, and H not in any position? Since secret ""dodge"" has no H, so H(x).
- Position 2: E vs O. O is not E, and E is in word but at position 5, not 2. So E at position 2 should be marked as -? Because E is in the word but wrong position? But position 5 is E, so E is definitely in the word. E at guess position 2 is not correct if secret position 2 is O. Therefore, since E is in word (at position 5), but not at position 2, it should be marked with '-' meaning present but wrong position. However, the symbol might vary, but by rules: ✓ correct position, - in word wrong position, x not in word.

So for E at position 2 in guess, when secret is ""dodge"" (no E at 2), but E is in secret at position 5, so - indeed.

Similarly, position 3:D correct, ✓; position 4:G correct, ✓; position 5:E correct, ✓.

Then the letter E at position 2 would be marked - because it's in the word but wrong position.

Similarly, if secret is ""hedge"", position 2 E would be ✓.

So we can tell from the feedback on position 2.

Similarly for position 1.

But let's not overcomplicate; we can guess ""hedge"" now.

So for the fourth guess: hedge

<guess>hedge</guess>But let's think if we can use a word that doesn't necessarily end with DGE but tests letters, but since we know last three must be DGE, it's fixed. So guessing any other word might waste letters.

So better to guess one of the candidates.### Step-by-Step Thought Process
- **Known Information from Previous Feedback:**
  - From **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: 
    - C, R, A, N are not in the word (all marked ""x"").
    - E is in the word and correctly at position 5 (marked ""✓"").
  - From **Guess 2 (""slide"")**:
    - S, L, I are not in the word (all marked ""x"").
    - D is in the word but not at position 4 (marked ""-"").
    - E is confirmed at position 5 (marked ""✓"").
  - From **Guess 3 (""budge"")**:
    - B and U are not in the word (both marked ""x"").
    - D is in the word and correctly at position 3 (marked ""✓"").
    - G is in the word and correctly at position 4 (marked ""✓"").
    - E is confirmed at position 5 (marked ""✓"").
- **Current Word Structure:**  
  Combining all feedback:
  - Positions 3, 4, and 5 are fixed: position 3 must be D, position 4 must be G, and position 5 must be E.
  - Therefore, the secret word has the pattern: `_ _ D G E`.
  - Only positions 1 and 2 are unknown.
- **Excluded Letters:**  
  Letters ruled out from all guesses: C, R, A, N, S, L, I, B, U. These cannot appear anywhere in the word.
- **Remaining Letters:**  
  Possible letters for positions 1 and 2 come from the remaining alphabet: F, H, K, M, O, P, T, V, W, Y, etc. (any letter not excluded). High-frequency options include H, O, P, T, W.
- **Possible Word Candidates:**  
  The secret word must match `_ _ D G E`. Valid English words fitting this pattern:
  - ""hedge"": H at position 1, E at position 2.
  - ""wedge"": W at position 1, E at position 2.
  - ""dodge"": D at position 1, O at position 2 (if double D is allowed, not ruled out by feedback).
  - ""wodge"": W at position 1, O at position 2 (less common, but possible).
- **Choosing the Guess:**  
  - The goal is to test positions 1 and 2 efficiently. Guessing one of these candidates directly can solve the word or provide critical feedback to refine further guesses.
  - ""hedge"" is a strong choice for the next guess because:
    - It covers common letters (H and E at position 2).
    - E at position 2 is testable—if it gets ""✓"", it confirms both position and letter; if ""-"", it confirms E is in the word (already known) but wrong position; if ""x"", it rules out E at position 2.
    - H is a high-frequency consonant to test for position 1.
    - If ""hedge"" is correct, the game ends. If not, feedback will reduce possibilities quickly (e.g., ""wedge"" or ""dodge"" become more likely based on the response).
- **Why Not Other Words?**  
  Guessing a word that doesn't end with ""DGE"" might waste the chance to confirm the fixed positions, as the ending is already known. Prioritizing candidates maximizes progress with minimal risk.",Guess 4: hedge -> FEEDBACK: H(✓) E(✓) D(✓) G(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
