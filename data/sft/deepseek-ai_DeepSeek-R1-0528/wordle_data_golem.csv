We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has common letters: we want at least two vowels and some frequent consonants.
 The word ""ROAST"" is a good candidate because:
   - It contains 'R', 'O', 'A', 'S', 'T' — all common letters.
   - It has two vowels ('O' and 'A') and three consonants.

 Alternatively, we can consider ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"". But let's go with ""ROAST"".

 However, note that the example in the rules used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", but we are free to choose.

 Another popular choice is ""RAISE"". It has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).

 But let's stick with a balanced word: ""ROAST"".

 However, to maximize the information, we might also consider ""CRATE"" or ""SLANT"". 

 After some thought, I recall that ""RAISE"" is often recommended because it has three vowels and common consonants.

 Let me choose ""RAISE"" for the first guess.

 But note: the example secret word was ""BRISK"", and if we guess ""RAISE"", we would get:
   R: present but in wrong position? (because in BRISK, R is at position 2, but in RAISE it's at position 1) -> so R would be marked as '-'
   A: not in BRISK -> 'x'
   I: in BRISK at position 3, and in RAISE at position 3 -> so I would be marked as '✓'
   S: in BRISK at position 4, and in RAISE at position 4? -> but in RAISE, S is at position 4, and in BRISK S is at position 4? Actually, BRISK is B-R-I-S-K, so S is at position 4. So S would be '✓'
   E: not in BRISK -> 'x'

 So the feedback would be: R(-), A(x), I(✓), S(✓), E(x)

 That gives two correct and one present. But we are just starting.

 However, for the first guess, we don't have any information. So any word is acceptable.

 I will go with ""RAISE"".

 But note: the problem says to return the guess in the specified format.

We are given feedback from the first guess: RAISE -> R(x), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(-)

Interpretation:
- R, A, I, S are not in the secret word at all (marked by x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (marked by -).

So we know:
- The secret word contains the letter E, but not in the fifth position (since we guessed E at the end and it's wrong position).
- The letters R, A, I, S are not in the word. So we must avoid these letters in our next guess.

Since E is in the word but not at the end, let's think about possible positions for E. It could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

We also know that the word does not contain R, A, I, S. Therefore, we must use other letters.

Now, we need to choose a new word that:
- Is 5 letters long and a valid English word.
- Does not contain R, A, I, S.
- Contains the letter E, but not at position 5 (since we already tried that and it was wrong). So E must be at positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

To maximize information, we might want to try E in a different position and use other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

We have used: R, A, I, S, E. So avoid R, A, I, S, but we can use E (if we put it in a new position) and new letters.

Common letters we haven't tried: T, N, O, L, U, D, C, M, etc.

Good strategy: try a word with E in a different position and test other vowels? But note: we have eliminated A and I, so the remaining vowels are O, U (and sometimes Y). But Y is less common.

We must have E in the word somewhere, but we don't know where. So we can try E at the beginning or in the middle.

Let me list some words that have E but not in the fifth position and do not contain R, A, I, S.

Possible positions for E:
- Position 1: E _ _ _ _
- Position 2: _ E _ _ _
- Position 3: _ _ E _ _
- Position 4: _ _ _ E _

We also want to use other common consonants.

Word ideas:
- Position 1: E ... e.g., ""ELBOW"", ""ENJOY"" -> but must be 5 letters and without R,A,I,S.
  ELBOW: E, L, B, O, W -> no R,A,I,S? Check: E, L, B, O, W. Good.
- Position 2: ... e.g., ""LEMON"", ""DEPOT"", ""TEMPO"" -> LEMON: L,E,M,O,N -> avoid? L,E,M,O,N: no R,A,I,S? Yes, but we don't know if these are in the word. We want to test new letters.
- Position 3: ... e.g., ""HOTEL"" -> H,O,T,E,L -> has E at position 4? Wait, H-O-T-E-L, E is at position 4? Actually: H=1, O=2, T=3, E=4, L=5 -> but we must place E not in 5? So position 4 is okay? But in our previous guess E was in position 5 and was wrong position, but we don't know about position 4 yet. However, note that the feedback for E was a minus, meaning E is in the word but not in position 5. But it could be in position 4? Actually, position 4 or others. So we can try E in position 4? Yes.

But let's avoid confusion: the secret word contains E, so we must include E in every guess until we know its position? Actually we don't have to, but we should because we know it's present and we haven't located its position yet. So it's efficient to include E again in a different position.

So I think including E again is good.

Try E in position 1: so words starting with E.

Possible words: ECHOS, ECLAT, EDIFY, EGRET, EJECT, ELBOW, ELEGY, ELEMENT? Wait 5 letters: ELBOW, EPOXY, ETHER, EXCEL? But must avoid R,A,I,S.

So:
- ELBOW: E, L, B, O, W -> all new letters? None of L,B,O,W have been tested? Correct? Yes. So this would test E at position 1 and L,B,O,W.

Similarly, other words: ENDOW, ENJOY? ENJOY: E,N,J,O,Y -> no R,A,I,S? J and Y might be less common.

But ELBOW seems like a good word: common and tests E in a new position.

Alternatively, position 2: let's think of words with E in position 2: e.g., ""HELLO"" -> but H,E,L,L,O. We don't know H and O. But double L? We want to test more distinct letters if possible.

Position 3: words like ""YETI"" not 5 letters? ""BELLE"" -> double L? ""FREED"" -> has R, we cannot use R. Must avoid R. So words with E in position 3: e.g., ""CREPE"" has R? CREPE: C,R,E,P,E -> R is excluded. No. ""PLUME"": P,L,U,M,E -> E at position 5? But we cannot use E at position 5? Wait, we can use it because we are trying a different position? Actually, we can use it again at position 5? It's allowed because we haven't confirmed it's not there? Actually, we don't know: the feedback just said the E is present but not in position 5. So if we put E again at position 5, we know it will be a minus again? Because if the word has E not in 5, then E at 5 will still be wrong. So it's redundant? So to learn new positions, we might avoid E at position 5.

So we should put E at positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Position 4: words like ""THYME"": T,H,Y,M,E -> but E is at position 5? Wait, no: T=1, H=2, Y=3, M=4, E=5 -> that puts E at 5 again. So bad.

Another: ""BEADS""? No, has A? Avoid A.

So let's look for words with E at position 4: e.g., ""MAPLE"" has A. Avoid. ""TOWEL"": T,O,W,E,L -> E at position 4? T(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), L(5). So that's good: E not in 5? But we don't mind position 5 for L? We want E at 4 to test.

Another: ""CABLE"" -> C=1, A=2? Avoid A.

""NOBLE"": N,O,B,L,E -> E is at position 5? N=1,O=2,B=3,L=4,E=5 -> again position 5. So bad.

Actually, position 4 would be the fourth letter, so we need a word where the fourth letter is E, but the fifth is not E and not a forbidden letter.

Example: ""BELLE"" -> B,E,L,L,E? Positions: B=1, E=2? We want letter 4. Another: ""TWEEN""? T,W,E,E,N? E at position 3? Not 4.

Perhaps: ""PRIDE""? Avoid R,I. ""BRIDE""? Avoid B? No R,A,I,S, but B is allowed? ""BRIDE"" has I? Avoid I.

Hard to find position 4. So maybe position 4 is not common? So stick with position 1 or 2.

Position 2: words like in position 2: ""CELLO"": C,E,L,L,O -> double L.

""DENIM"": D,E,N,I,M -> has I? Avoid I.

Words with E in position 2: ""VEIL"" not 5? ""BEIGE"": B,E,I,G,E -> I is excluded? Avoid I.

""DEUCE"": D,E,U,C,E -> E at position 2 and 5? But we are avoiding position 5? But this has two E's? Permissible? Maybe? But we know there's an E? But we don't know if there are two? So DEUCE: D,E,U,C,E -> so E at position 5? We want to avoid position 5? But if the word only has one E and it's not at 5, then putting E at 5 again will be minus? But putting E at 2 might be correct or minus.

But to avoid redundancy? Better to put E at a position we haven't tried? We tried position 5, so try 2? So DEUCE? But DEUCE has E at 5? It's tricky.

Alternatively: ""MEATY"" has A? Avoid A.

So let's go back to position 1: 

ELBOW: E,L,B,O,W -> valid and common letters.

Other words: EIGHT? Has G,H,T? But E,I,G,H,T? But we must avoid I? EIGHT has I? Avoid.

ECLAT? E,C,L,A,T -> has A? Avoid A.

So ELBOW seems good: E L B O W -> no A, R, I, S.

Another common word: ""EXCEL""? But E,X,C,E,L -> E at positions 1 and 4? And L at end. But E at 4? We haven't tried. But also has E at 1? Actually, EXCEL: E=1, X=2, C=3, E=4, L=5 -> E at 1 and 4? And L at 5. Since we know E is in the word, we can test E at two positions? But note that if the word has only one E, then one of these will be misplaced unless it hits exactly. But EXCEL contains A,R,I,S? Let's check: E, X, C, E, L? None of R,A,I,S. So acceptable? Yes.

But let me avoid double E? Because it might confuse? But possible. Actually, in ELBOW we have distinct letters? Yes.

So I think ELBOW is a safe bet to test E at the beginning and other common letters.

But we must remember that the word might have duplicate letters? But we haven't encountered any indication yet? So ELBOW is distinct letters.

Another word: ""ENVOY"": E,N,V,O,Y? Also good? Envoy: E,N,V,O,Y -> no R,A,I,S? Yes.

But ELBOW is more common? Both okay.

I'll go with ELBOW.

But note: we also have not tried T, N, D, etc? So ELBOW introduces B, O, L, W.

Alternatively, we can try a word with T? T is very common.

For example, position 2: METRO? Avoid M,E,T,R,O? R is excluded? METRO has R? Avoid.

Position 1: TEMPO? T,E,M,P,O -> E at position 2? And O? T,E,M,P,O? And no R,A,I,S? Check: T,E,M,P,O -> no R,A,I,S? Yes.

TEMPO: T=1, E=2, M=3, P=4, O=5? So E at position 2? That's good because we haven't tried position 2.

And TEMPO has T and E? And common letters? M,P,O.

Compared to ELBOW? ELBOW has E at 1? But TEMPO has E at 2.

TEMPO might be better? Because we are testing E at position 2.

But we don't have much preference? Both are valid.

But TEMPO has T? Which is very common? So likely to get hits? But note: we know E is in? But T might be in or not? So TEMPO tests more letters: T,E,M,P,O.

Elbow: E,L,B,O,W? Less common letters? But okay.

I think either is fine.

Let's choose TEMPO? Because T and O are frequent.

Another: ""BEGIN"": has B,E,G,I,N -> I is excluded? Avoid I.

So TEMPO seems solid.

But TEMPO? Is it a valid word? Yes.

So I'll guess TEMPO.

But let me confirm the letters: T, E, M, P, O. None of R,A,I,S? Correct? R is not in T,E,M,P,O. A,I,S are not present.

And we have E? Yes, in position 2? Not position 5? Correct? Position 2 is new.

So better than ELBOW? Because E at a different position? And TEMPO is equally common.

But ELBOW would test different letters? Let's decide.

I'll go with TEMPO.

So next guess: TEMPO.

In summary: we are avoiding R,A,I,S and including E at position 2.

Response format: <guess> TEMPO </guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess RAISE, where R(x), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(-):
- The letters R, A, I, and S are **not** in the secret word, so they must be avoided.
- The letter E **is** in the secret word, but not in the fifth position. Therefore, E must appear in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

For the next guess:
- The word must include E (in a position other than 5) to test its correct location.
- It should use new, common letters to maximize information gain, avoiding R, A, I, S.
- Candidates considered: 
  - ELBOW (E at position 1) introduces L, B, O, W.
  - TEMPO (E at position 2) introduces T, M, P, O.
  - TEMPO was chosen because it places E in an untested position (2) and uses high-frequency letters like T and O, which are commonly found in 5-letter words.

With TEMPO:
- E is tested in position 2 (new spot), and T, M, P, O are introduced.
- If E appears in position 2 in the secret word, it will show ✓; otherwise, feedback will indicate if it needs to move to 1, 3, or 4.
- The letters T, M, P, O are all untested, so feedback will reveal new information.

Interpretation:

We also know that the word does not contain R, A, I, S. Therefore, we must use other letters.

Now, we need to choose a new word that:
- Is 5 letters long and a valid English word.
- Does not contain R, A, I, S.
- Contains the letter E, but not at position 5 (since we already tried that and it was wrong). So E must be at positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

To maximize information, we might want to try E in a different position and use other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

We have used: R, A, I, S, E. So avoid R, A, I, S, but we can use E (if we put it in a new position) and new letters.

Common letters we haven't tried: T, N, O, L, U, D, C, M, etc.

Good strategy: try a word with E in a different position and test other vowels? But note: we have eliminated A and I, so the remaining vowels are O, U (and sometimes Y). But Y is less common.

We must have E in the word somewhere, but we don't know where. So we can try E at the beginning or in the middle.

Let me list some words that have E but not in the fifth position and do not contain R, A, I, S.

Possible positions for E:
- Position 1: E _ _ _ _
- Position 2: _ E _ _ _
- Position 3: _ _ E _ _
- Position 4: _ _ _ E _

We also want to use other common consonants.

Word ideas:
- Position 1: E ... e.g., ""ELBOW"", ""ENJOY"" -> but must be 5 letters and without R,A,I,S.
  ELBOW: E, L, B, O, W -> no R,A,I,S? Check: E, L, B, O, W. Good.
- Position 2: ... e.g., ""LEMON"", ""DEPOT"", ""TEMPO"" -> LEMON: L,E,M,O,N -> avoid? L,E,M,O,N: no R,A,I,S? Yes, but we don't know if these are in the word. We want to test new letters.
- Position 3: ... e.g., ""HOTEL"" -> H,O,T,E,L -> has E at position 4? Wait, H-O-T-E-L, E is at position 4? Actually: H=1, O=2, T=3, E=4, L=5 -> but we must place E not in 5? So position 4 is okay? But in our previous guess E was in position 5 and was wrong position, but we don't know about position 4 yet. However, note that the feedback for E was a minus, meaning E is in the word but not in position 5. But it could be in position 4? Actually, position 4 or others. So we can try E in position 4? Yes.

But let's avoid confusion: the secret word contains E, so we must include E in every guess until we know its position? Actually we don't have to, but we should because we know it's present and we haven't located its position yet. So it's efficient to include E again in a different position.

So I think including E again is good.

Try E in position 1: so words starting with E.

Possible words: ECHOS, ECLAT, EDIFY, EGRET, EJECT, ELBOW, ELEGY, ELEMENT? Wait 5 letters: ELBOW, EPOXY, ETHER, EXCEL? But must avoid R,A,I,S.

So:
- ELBOW: E, L, B, O, W -> all new letters? None of L,B,O,W have been tested? Correct? Yes. So this would test E at position 1 and L,B,O,W.

Similarly, other words: ENDOW, ENJOY? ENJOY: E,N,J,O,Y -> no R,A,I,S? J and Y might be less common.

But ELBOW seems like a good word: common and tests E in a new position.

Alternatively, position 2: let's think of words with E in position 2: e.g., ""HELLO"" -> but H,E,L,L,O. We don't know H and O. But double L? We want to test more distinct letters if possible.

Position 3: words like ""YETI"" not 5 letters? ""BELLE"" -> double L? ""FREED"" -> has R, we cannot use R. Must avoid R. So words with E in position 3: e.g., ""CREPE"" has R? CREPE: C,R,E,P,E -> R is excluded. No. ""PLUME"": P,L,U,M,E -> E at position 5? But we cannot use E at position 5? Wait, we can use it because we are trying a different position? Actually, we can use it again at position 5? It's allowed because we haven't confirmed it's not there? Actually, we don't know: the feedback just said the E is present but not in position 5. So if we put E again at position 5, we know it will be a minus again? Because if the word has E not in 5, then E at 5 will still be wrong. So it's redundant? So to learn new positions, we might avoid E at position 5.

So we should put E at positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Position 4: words like ""THYME"": T,H,Y,M,E -> but E is at position 5? Wait, no: T=1, H=2, Y=3, M=4, E=5 -> that puts E at 5 again. So bad.

Another: ""BEADS""? No, has A? Avoid A.

So let's look for words with E at position 4: e.g., ""MAPLE"" has A. Avoid. ""TOWEL"": T,O,W,E,L -> E at position 4? T(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), L(5). So that's good: E not in 5? But we don't mind position 5 for L? We want E at 4 to test.

Another: ""CABLE"" -> C=1, A=2? Avoid A.

""NOBLE"": N,O,B,L,E -> E is at position 5? N=1,O=2,B=3,L=4,E=5 -> again position 5. So bad.

Actually, position 4 would be the fourth letter, so we need a word where the fourth letter is E, but the fifth is not E and not a forbidden letter.

Example: ""BELLE"" -> B,E,L,L,E? Positions: B=1, E=2? We want letter 4. Another: ""TWEEN""? T,W,E,E,N? E at position 3? Not 4.

Perhaps: ""PRIDE""? Avoid R,I. ""BRIDE""? Avoid B? No R,A,I,S, but B is allowed? ""BRIDE"" has I? Avoid I.

Hard to find position 4. So maybe position 4 is not common? So stick with position 1 or 2.

Position 2: words like in position 2: ""CELLO"": C,E,L,L,O -> double L.

""DENIM"": D,E,N,I,M -> has I? Avoid I.

Words with E in position 2: ""VEIL"" not 5? ""BEIGE"": B,E,I,G,E -> I is excluded? Avoid I.

""DEUCE"": D,E,U,C,E -> E at position 2 and 5? But we are avoiding position 5? But this has two E's? Permissible? Maybe? But we know there's an E? But we don't know if there are two? So DEUCE: D,E,U,C,E -> so E at position 5? We want to avoid position 5? But if the word only has one E and it's not at 5, then putting E at 5 again will be minus? But putting E at 2 might be correct or minus.

But to avoid redundancy? Better to put E at a position we haven't tried? We tried position 5, so try 2? So DEUCE? But DEUCE has E at 5? It's tricky.

Alternatively: ""MEATY"" has A? Avoid A.

So let's go back to position 1: 

ELBOW: E,L,B,O,W -> valid and common letters.

Other words: EIGHT? Has G,H,T? But E,I,G,H,T? But we must avoid I? EIGHT has I? Avoid.

ECLAT? E,C,L,A,T -> has A? Avoid A.

So ELBOW seems good: E L B O W -> no A, R, I, S.

Another common word: ""EXCEL""? But E,X,C,E,L -> E at positions 1 and 4? And L at end. But E at 4? We haven't tried. But also has E at 1? Actually, EXCEL: E=1, X=2, C=3, E=4, L=5 -> E at 1 and 4? And L at 5. Since we know E is in the word, we can test E at two positions? But note that if the word has only one E, then one of these will be misplaced unless it hits exactly. But EXCEL contains A,R,I,S? Let's check: E, X, C, E, L? None of R,A,I,S. So acceptable? Yes.

But let me avoid double E? Because it might confuse? But possible. Actually, in ELBOW we have distinct letters? Yes.

So I think ELBOW is a safe bet to test E at the beginning and other common letters.

But we must remember that the word might have duplicate letters? But we haven't encountered any indication yet? So ELBOW is distinct letters.

Another word: ""ENVOY"": E,N,V,O,Y? Also good? Envoy: E,N,V,O,Y -> no R,A,I,S? Yes.

But ELBOW is more common? Both okay.

I'll go with ELBOW.

But note: we also have not tried T, N, D, etc? So ELBOW introduces B, O, L, W.

Alternatively, we can try a word with T? T is very common.

For example, position 2: METRO? Avoid M,E,T,R,O? R is excluded? METRO has R? Avoid.

Position 1: TEMPO? T,E,M,P,O -> E at position 2? And O? T,E,M,P,O? And no R,A,I,S? Check: T,E,M,P,O -> no R,A,I,S? Yes.

TEMPO: T=1, E=2, M=3, P=4, O=5? So E at position 2? That's good because we haven't tried position 2.

And TEMPO has T and E? And common letters? M,P,O.

Compared to ELBOW? ELBOW has E at 1? But TEMPO has E at 2.

TEMPO might be better? Because we are testing E at position 2.

But we don't have much preference? Both are valid.

But TEMPO has T? Which is very common? So likely to get hits? But note: we know E is in? But T might be in or not? So TEMPO tests more letters: T,E,M,P,O.

Elbow: E,L,B,O,W? Less common letters? But okay.

I think either is fine.

Let's choose TEMPO? Because T and O are frequent.

Another: ""BEGIN"": has B,E,G,I,N -> I is excluded? Avoid I.

So TEMPO seems solid.

But TEMPO? Is it a valid word? Yes.

So I'll guess TEMPO.

But let me confirm the letters: T, E, M, P, O. None of R,A,I,S? Correct? R is not in T,E,M,P,O. A,I,S are not present.

And we have E? Yes, in position 2? Not position 5? Correct? Position 2 is new.

So better than ELBOW? Because E at a different position? And TEMPO is equally common.

But ELBOW would test different letters? Let's decide.

I'll go with TEMPO.

So next guess: TEMPO.

In summary: we are avoiding R,A,I,S and including E at position 2.

Response format: <guess> TEMPO </guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess RAISE, where R(x), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(-):
- The letters R, A, I, and S are **not** in the secret word, so they must be avoided.
- The letter E **is** in the secret word, but not in the fifth position. Therefore, E must appear in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

For the next guess:
- The word must include E (in a position other than 5) to test its correct location.
- It should use new, common letters to maximize information gain, avoiding R, A, I, S.
- Candidates considered: 
  - ELBOW (E at position 1) introduces L, B, O, W.
  - TEMPO (E at position 2) introduces T, M, P, O.
  - TEMPO was chosen because it places E in an untested position (2) and uses high-frequency letters like T and O, which are commonly found in 5-letter words.

With TEMPO:
- E is tested in position 2 (new spot), and T, M, P, O are introduced.
- If E appears in position 2 in the secret word, it will show ✓; otherwise, feedback will indicate if it needs to move to 1, 3, or 4.
- The letters T, M, P, O are all untested, so feedback will reveal new information.",Guess 2: TEMPO -> FEEDBACK: T(x) E(-) M(-) P(x) O(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,golem,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has common letters: we want at least two vowels and some frequent consonants.
 The word ""ROAST"" is a good candidate because:
   - It contains 'R', 'O', 'A', 'S', 'T' — all common letters.
   - It has two vowels ('O' and 'A') and three consonants.

 Alternatively, we can consider ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"". But let's go with ""ROAST"".

 However, note that the example in the rules used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", but we are free to choose.

 Another popular choice is ""RAISE"". It has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).

 But let's stick with a balanced word: ""ROAST"".

 However, to maximize the information, we might also consider ""CRATE"" or ""SLANT"". 

 After some thought, I recall that ""RAISE"" is often recommended because it has three vowels and common consonants.

 Let me choose ""RAISE"" for the first guess.

 But note: the example secret word was ""BRISK"", and if we guess ""RAISE"", we would get:
   R: present but in wrong position? (because in BRISK, R is at position 2, but in RAISE it's at position 1) -> so R would be marked as '-'
   A: not in BRISK -> 'x'
   I: in BRISK at position 3, and in RAISE at position 3 -> so I would be marked as '✓'
   S: in BRISK at position 4, and in RAISE at position 4? -> but in RAISE, S is at position 4, and in BRISK S is at position 4? Actually, BRISK is B-R-I-S-K, so S is at position 4. So S would be '✓'
   E: not in BRISK -> 'x'

 So the feedback would be: R(-), A(x), I(✓), S(✓), E(x)

 That gives two correct and one present. But we are just starting.

 However, for the first guess, we don't have any information. So any word is acceptable.

 I will go with ""RAISE"".

 But note: the problem says to return the guess in the specified format.

 Let me output: <guess> RAISE </guess>For the first guess, I chose ""RAISE"" because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which helps test frequently used letters. This increases the chances of getting useful feedback about the secret word's letters and their positions.

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: RAISE -> R(x), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(-)

Interpretation:
- R, A, I, S are not in the secret word at all (marked by x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (marked by -).

So we know:
- The secret word contains the letter E, but not in the fifth position (since we guessed E at the end and it's wrong position).
- The letters R, A, I, S are not in the word. So we must avoid these letters in our next guess.

Since E is in the word but not at the end, let's think about possible positions for E. It could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

We also know that the word does not contain R, A, I, S. Therefore, we must use other letters.

Now, we need to choose a new word that:
- Is 5 letters long and a valid English word.
- Does not contain R, A, I, S.
- Contains the letter E, but not at position 5 (since we already tried that and it was wrong). So E must be at positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

To maximize information, we might want to try E in a different position and use other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

We have used: R, A, I, S, E. So avoid R, A, I, S, but we can use E (if we put it in a new position) and new letters.

Common letters we haven't tried: T, N, O, L, U, D, C, M, etc.

Good strategy: try a word with E in a different position and test other vowels? But note: we have eliminated A and I, so the remaining vowels are O, U (and sometimes Y). But Y is less common.

We must have E in the word somewhere, but we don't know where. So we can try E at the beginning or in the middle.

Let me list some words that have E but not in the fifth position and do not contain R, A, I, S.

Possible positions for E:
- Position 1: E _ _ _ _
- Position 2: _ E _ _ _
- Position 3: _ _ E _ _
- Position 4: _ _ _ E _

We also want to use other common consonants.

Word ideas:
- Position 1: E ... e.g., ""ELBOW"", ""ENJOY"" -> but must be 5 letters and without R,A,I,S.
  ELBOW: E, L, B, O, W -> no R,A,I,S? Check: E, L, B, O, W. Good.
- Position 2: ... e.g., ""LEMON"", ""DEPOT"", ""TEMPO"" -> LEMON: L,E,M,O,N -> avoid? L,E,M,O,N: no R,A,I,S? Yes, but we don't know if these are in the word. We want to test new letters.
- Position 3: ... e.g., ""HOTEL"" -> H,O,T,E,L -> has E at position 4? Wait, H-O-T-E-L, E is at position 4? Actually: H=1, O=2, T=3, E=4, L=5 -> but we must place E not in 5? So position 4 is okay? But in our previous guess E was in position 5 and was wrong position, but we don't know about position 4 yet. However, note that the feedback for E was a minus, meaning E is in the word but not in position 5. But it could be in position 4? Actually, position 4 or others. So we can try E in position 4? Yes.

But let's avoid confusion: the secret word contains E, so we must include E in every guess until we know its position? Actually we don't have to, but we should because we know it's present and we haven't located its position yet. So it's efficient to include E again in a different position.

So I think including E again is good.

Try E in position 1: so words starting with E.

Possible words: ECHOS, ECLAT, EDIFY, EGRET, EJECT, ELBOW, ELEGY, ELEMENT? Wait 5 letters: ELBOW, EPOXY, ETHER, EXCEL? But must avoid R,A,I,S.

So:
- ELBOW: E, L, B, O, W -> all new letters? None of L,B,O,W have been tested? Correct? Yes. So this would test E at position 1 and L,B,O,W.

Similarly, other words: ENDOW, ENJOY? ENJOY: E,N,J,O,Y -> no R,A,I,S? J and Y might be less common.

But ELBOW seems like a good word: common and tests E in a new position.

Alternatively, position 2: let's think of words with E in position 2: e.g., ""HELLO"" -> but H,E,L,L,O. We don't know H and O. But double L? We want to test more distinct letters if possible.

Position 3: words like ""YETI"" not 5 letters? ""BELLE"" -> double L? ""FREED"" -> has R, we cannot use R. Must avoid R. So words with E in position 3: e.g., ""CREPE"" has R? CREPE: C,R,E,P,E -> R is excluded. No. ""PLUME"": P,L,U,M,E -> E at position 5? But we cannot use E at position 5? Wait, we can use it because we are trying a different position? Actually, we can use it again at position 5? It's allowed because we haven't confirmed it's not there? Actually, we don't know: the feedback just said the E is present but not in position 5. So if we put E again at position 5, we know it will be a minus again? Because if the word has E not in 5, then E at 5 will still be wrong. So it's redundant? So to learn new positions, we might avoid E at position 5.

So we should put E at positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Position 4: words like ""THYME"": T,H,Y,M,E -> but E is at position 5? Wait, no: T=1, H=2, Y=3, M=4, E=5 -> that puts E at 5 again. So bad.

Another: ""BEADS""? No, has A? Avoid A.

So let's look for words with E at position 4: e.g., ""MAPLE"" has A. Avoid. ""TOWEL"": T,O,W,E,L -> E at position 4? T(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), L(5). So that's good: E not in 5? But we don't mind position 5 for L? We want E at 4 to test.

Another: ""CABLE"" -> C=1, A=2? Avoid A.

""NOBLE"": N,O,B,L,E -> E is at position 5? N=1,O=2,B=3,L=4,E=5 -> again position 5. So bad.

Actually, position 4 would be the fourth letter, so we need a word where the fourth letter is E, but the fifth is not E and not a forbidden letter.

Example: ""BELLE"" -> B,E,L,L,E? Positions: B=1, E=2? We want letter 4. Another: ""TWEEN""? T,W,E,E,N? E at position 3? Not 4.

Perhaps: ""PRIDE""? Avoid R,I. ""BRIDE""? Avoid B? No R,A,I,S, but B is allowed? ""BRIDE"" has I? Avoid I.

Hard to find position 4. So maybe position 4 is not common? So stick with position 1 or 2.

Position 2: words like in position 2: ""CELLO"": C,E,L,L,O -> double L.

""DENIM"": D,E,N,I,M -> has I? Avoid I.

Words with E in position 2: ""VEIL"" not 5? ""BEIGE"": B,E,I,G,E -> I is excluded? Avoid I.

""DEUCE"": D,E,U,C,E -> E at position 2 and 5? But we are avoiding position 5? But this has two E's? Permissible? Maybe? But we know there's an E? But we don't know if there are two? So DEUCE: D,E,U,C,E -> so E at position 5? We want to avoid position 5? But if the word only has one E and it's not at 5, then putting E at 5 again will be minus? But putting E at 2 might be correct or minus.

But to avoid redundancy? Better to put E at a position we haven't tried? We tried position 5, so try 2? So DEUCE? But DEUCE has E at 5? It's tricky.

Alternatively: ""MEATY"" has A? Avoid A.

So let's go back to position 1: 

ELBOW: E,L,B,O,W -> valid and common letters.

Other words: EIGHT? Has G,H,T? But E,I,G,H,T? But we must avoid I? EIGHT has I? Avoid.

ECLAT? E,C,L,A,T -> has A? Avoid A.

So ELBOW seems good: E L B O W -> no A, R, I, S.

Another common word: ""EXCEL""? But E,X,C,E,L -> E at positions 1 and 4? And L at end. But E at 4? We haven't tried. But also has E at 1? Actually, EXCEL: E=1, X=2, C=3, E=4, L=5 -> E at 1 and 4? And L at 5. Since we know E is in the word, we can test E at two positions? But note that if the word has only one E, then one of these will be misplaced unless it hits exactly. But EXCEL contains A,R,I,S? Let's check: E, X, C, E, L? None of R,A,I,S. So acceptable? Yes.

But let me avoid double E? Because it might confuse? But possible. Actually, in ELBOW we have distinct letters? Yes.

So I think ELBOW is a safe bet to test E at the beginning and other common letters.

But we must remember that the word might have duplicate letters? But we haven't encountered any indication yet? So ELBOW is distinct letters.

Another word: ""ENVOY"": E,N,V,O,Y? Also good? Envoy: E,N,V,O,Y -> no R,A,I,S? Yes.

But ELBOW is more common? Both okay.

I'll go with ELBOW.

But note: we also have not tried T, N, D, etc? So ELBOW introduces B, O, L, W.

Alternatively, we can try a word with T? T is very common.

For example, position 2: METRO? Avoid M,E,T,R,O? R is excluded? METRO has R? Avoid.

Position 1: TEMPO? T,E,M,P,O -> E at position 2? And O? T,E,M,P,O? And no R,A,I,S? Check: T,E,M,P,O -> no R,A,I,S? Yes.

TEMPO: T=1, E=2, M=3, P=4, O=5? So E at position 2? That's good because we haven't tried position 2.

And TEMPO has T and E? And common letters? M,P,O.

Compared to ELBOW? ELBOW has E at 1? But TEMPO has E at 2.

TEMPO might be better? Because we are testing E at position 2.

But we don't have much preference? Both are valid.

But TEMPO has T? Which is very common? So likely to get hits? But note: we know E is in? But T might be in or not? So TEMPO tests more letters: T,E,M,P,O.

Elbow: E,L,B,O,W? Less common letters? But okay.

I think either is fine.

Let's choose TEMPO? Because T and O are frequent.

Another: ""BEGIN"": has B,E,G,I,N -> I is excluded? Avoid I.

So TEMPO seems solid.

But TEMPO? Is it a valid word? Yes.

So I'll guess TEMPO.

But let me confirm the letters: T, E, M, P, O. None of R,A,I,S? Correct? R is not in T,E,M,P,O. A,I,S are not present.

And we have E? Yes, in position 2? Not position 5? Correct? Position 2 is new.

So better than ELBOW? Because E at a different position? And TEMPO is equally common.

But ELBOW would test different letters? Let's decide.

I'll go with TEMPO.

So next guess: TEMPO.

In summary: we are avoiding R,A,I,S and including E at position 2.

Response format: <guess> TEMPO </guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess RAISE, where R(x), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(-):
- The letters R, A, I, and S are **not** in the secret word, so they must be avoided.
- The letter E **is** in the secret word, but not in the fifth position. Therefore, E must appear in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

For the next guess:
- The word must include E (in a position other than 5) to test its correct location.
- It should use new, common letters to maximize information gain, avoiding R, A, I, S.
- Candidates considered: 
  - ELBOW (E at position 1) introduces L, B, O, W.

  - TEMPO was chosen because it places E in an untested position (2) and uses high-frequency letters like T and O, which are commonly found in 5-letter words.

With TEMPO:
- E is tested in position 2 (new spot), and T, M, P, O are introduced.
- If E appears in position 2 in the secret word, it will show ✓; otherwise, feedback will indicate if it needs to move to 1, 3, or 4.
- The letters T, M, P, O are all untested, so feedback will reveal new information.

We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.\n A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.\n Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.\n\n Let\'s choose a word that has common letters: we want at least two vowels and some frequent consonants.\n The word ""ROAST"" is a good candidate because:\n   - It contains \'R\', \'O\', \'A\', \'S\', \'T\' — all common letters.\n   - It has two vowels (\'O\' and \'A\') and three consonants.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"". But let\'s go with ""ROAST"".\n\n However, note that the example in the rules used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", but we are free to choose.\n\n Another popular choice is ""RAISE"". It has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).\n\n But let\'s stick with a balanced word: ""ROAST"".\n\n However, to maximize the information, we might also consider ""CRATE"" or ""SLANT"". \n\n After some thought, I recall that ""RAISE"" is often recommended because it has three vowels and common consonants.\n\n Let me choose ""RAISE"" for the first guess.\n\n But note: the example secret word was ""BRISK"", and if we guess ""RAISE"", we would get:\n   R: present but in wrong position? (because in BRISK, R is at position 2, but in RAISE it\'s at position 1) -> so R would be marked as \'-\'\n   A: not in BRISK -> \'x\'\n   I: in BRISK at position 3, and in RAISE at position 3 -> so I would be marked as \'✓\'\n   S: in BRISK at position 4, and in RAISE at position 4? -> but in RAISE, S is at position 4, and in BRISK S is at position 4? Actually, BRISK is B-R-I-S-K, so S is at position 4. So S would be \'✓\'\n   E: not in BRISK -> \'x\'\n\n So the feedback would be: R(-), A(x), I(✓), S(✓), E(x)\n\n That gives two correct and one present. But we are just starting.\n\n However, for the first guess, we don\'t have any information. So any word is acceptable.\n\n I will go with ""RAISE"".\n\n But note: the problem says to return the guess in the specified format.\n\n Let me output: <guess> RAISE </guess>For the first guess, I chose ""RAISE"" because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which helps test frequently used letters. This increases the chances of getting useful feedback about the secret word\'s letters and their positions.\n\n<guess>RAISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from the first guess: RAISE -> R(x), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(-)\n\nInterpretation:\n- R, A, I, S are not in the secret word at all (marked by x).\n- E is in the word but in the wrong position (marked by -).\n\nSo we know:\n- The secret word contains the letter E, but not in the fifth position (since we guessed E at the end and it\'s wrong position).\n- The letters R, A, I, S are not in the word. So we must avoid these letters in our next guess.\n\nSince E is in the word but not at the end, let\'s think about possible positions for E. It could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nWe also know that the word does not contain R, A, I, S. Therefore, we must use other letters.\n\nNow, we need to choose a new word that:\n- Is 5 letters long and a valid English word.\n- Does not contain R, A, I, S.\n- Contains the letter E, but not at position 5 (since we already tried that and it was wrong). So E must be at positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nTo maximize information, we might want to try E in a different position and use other common letters that we haven\'t tried yet.\n\nWe have used: R, A, I, S, E. So avoid R, A, I, S, but we can use E (if we put it in a new position) and new letters.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tried: T, N, O, L, U, D, C, M, etc.\n\nGood strategy: try a word with E in a different position and test other vowels? But note: we have eliminated A and I, so the remaining vowels are O, U (and sometimes Y). But Y is less common.\n\nWe must have E in the word somewhere, but we don\'t know where. So we can try E at the beginning or in the middle.\n\nLet me list some words that have E but not in the fifth position and do not contain R, A, I, S.\n\nPossible positions for E:\n- Position 1: E _ _ _ _\n- Position 2: _ E _ _ _\n- Position 3: _ _ E _ _\n- Position 4: _ _ _ E _\n\nWe also want to use other common consonants.\n\nWord ideas:\n- Position 1: E ... e.g., ""ELBOW"", ""ENJOY"" -> but must be 5 letters and without R,A,I,S.\n  ELBOW: E, L, B, O, W -> no R,A,I,S? Check: E, L, B, O, W. Good.\n- Position 2: ... e.g., ""LEMON"", ""DEPOT"", ""TEMPO"" -> LEMON: L,E,M,O,N -> avoid? L,E,M,O,N: no R,A,I,S? Yes, but we don\'t know if these are in the word. We want to test new letters.\n- Position 3: ... e.g., ""HOTEL"" -> H,O,T,E,L -> has E at position 4? Wait, H-O-T-E-L, E is at position 4? Actually: H=1, O=2, T=3, E=4, L=5 -> but we must place E not in 5? So position 4 is okay? But in our previous guess E was in position 5 and was wrong position, but we don\'t know about position 4 yet. However, note that the feedback for E was a minus, meaning E is in the word but not in position 5. But it could be in position 4? Actually, position 4 or others. So we can try E in position 4? Yes.\n\nBut let\'s avoid confusion: the secret word contains E, so we must include E in every guess until we know its position? Actually we don\'t have to, but we should because we know it\'s present and we haven\'t located its position yet. So it\'s efficient to include E again in a different position.\n\nSo I think including E again is good.\n\nTry E in position 1: so words starting with E.\n\nPossible words: ECHOS, ECLAT, EDIFY, EGRET, EJECT, ELBOW, ELEGY, ELEMENT? Wait 5 letters: ELBOW, EPOXY, ETHER, EXCEL? But must avoid R,A,I,S.\n\nSo:\n- ELBOW: E, L, B, O, W -> all new letters? None of L,B,O,W have been tested? Correct? Yes. So this would test E at position 1 and L,B,O,W.\n\nSimilarly, other words: ENDOW, ENJOY? ENJOY: E,N,J,O,Y -> no R,A,I,S? J and Y might be less common.\n\nBut ELBOW seems like a good word: common and tests E in a new position.\n\nAlternatively, position 2: let\'s think of words with E in position 2: e.g., ""HELLO"" -> but H,E,L,L,O. We don\'t know H and O. But double L? We want to test more distinct letters if possible.\n\nPosition 3: words like ""YETI"" not 5 letters? ""BELLE"" -> double L? ""FREED"" -> has R, we cannot use R. Must avoid R. So words with E in position 3: e.g., ""CREPE"" has R? CREPE: C,R,E,P,E -> R is excluded. No. ""PLUME"": P,L,U,M,E -> E at position 5? But we cannot use E at position 5? Wait, we can use it because we are trying a different position? Actually, we can use it again at position 5? It\'s allowed because we haven\'t confirmed it\'s not there? Actually, we don\'t know: the feedback just said the E is present but not in position 5. So if we put E again at position 5, we know it will be a minus again? Because if the word has E not in 5, then E at 5 will still be wrong. So it\'s redundant? So to learn new positions, we might avoid E at position 5.\n\nSo we should put E at positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nPosition 4: words like ""THYME"": T,H,Y,M,E -> but E is at position 5? Wait, no: T=1, H=2, Y=3, M=4, E=5 -> that puts E at 5 again. So bad.\n\nAnother: ""BEADS""? No, has A? Avoid A.\n\nSo let\'s look for words with E at position 4: e.g., ""MAPLE"" has A. Avoid. ""TOWEL"": T,O,W,E,L -> E at position 4? T(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), L(5). So that\'s good: E not in 5? But we don\'t mind position 5 for L? We want E at 4 to test.\n\nAnother: ""CABLE"" -> C=1, A=2? Avoid A.\n\n""NOBLE"": N,O,B,L,E -> E is at position 5? N=1,O=2,B=3,L=4,E=5 -> again position 5. So bad.\n\nActually, position 4 would be the fourth letter, so we need a word where the fourth letter is E, but the fifth is not E and not a forbidden letter.\n\nExample: ""BELLE"" -> B,E,L,L,E? Positions: B=1, E=2? We want letter 4. Another: ""TWEEN""? T,W,E,E,N? E at position 3? Not 4.\n\nPerhaps: ""PRIDE""? Avoid R,I. ""BRIDE""? Avoid B? No R,A,I,S, but B is allowed? ""BRIDE"" has I? Avoid I.\n\nHard to find position 4. So maybe position 4 is not common? So stick with position 1 or 2.\n\nPosition 2: words like in position 2: ""CELLO"": C,E,L,L,O -> double L.\n\n""DENIM"": D,E,N,I,M -> has I? Avoid I.\n\nWords with E in position 2: ""VEIL"" not 5? ""BEIGE"": B,E,I,G,E -> I is excluded? Avoid I.\n\n""DEUCE"": D,E,U,C,E -> E at position 2 and 5? But we are avoiding position 5? But this has two E\'s? Permissible? Maybe? But we know there\'s an E? But we don\'t know if there are two? So DEUCE: D,E,U,C,E -> so E at position 5? We want to avoid position 5? But if the word only has one E and it\'s not at 5, then putting E at 5 again will be minus? But putting E at 2 might be correct or minus.\n\nBut to avoid redundancy? Better to put E at a position we haven\'t tried? We tried position 5, so try 2? So DEUCE? But DEUCE has E at 5? It\'s tricky.\n\nAlternatively: ""MEATY"" has A? Avoid A.\n\nSo let\'s go back to position 1: \n\nELBOW: E,L,B,O,W -> valid and common letters.\n\nOther words: EIGHT? Has G,H,T? But E,I,G,H,T? But we must avoid I? EIGHT has I? Avoid.\n\nECLAT? E,C,L,A,T -> has A? Avoid A.\n\nSo ELBOW seems good: E L B O W -> no A, R, I, S.\n\nAnother common word: ""EXCEL""? But E,X,C,E,L -> E at positions 1 and 4? And L at end. But E at 4? We haven\'t tried. But also has E at 1? Actually, EXCEL: E=1, X=2, C=3, E=4, L=5 -> E at 1 and 4? And L at 5. Since we know E is in the word, we can test E at two positions? But note that if the word has only one E, then one of these will be misplaced unless it hits exactly. But EXCEL contains A,R,I,S? Let\'s check: E, X, C, E, L? None of R,A,I,S. So acceptable? Yes.\n\nBut let me avoid double E? Because it might confuse? But possible. Actually, in ELBOW we have distinct letters? Yes.\n\nSo I think ELBOW is a safe bet to test E at the beginning and other common letters.\n\nBut we must remember that the word might have duplicate letters? But we haven\'t encountered any indication yet? So ELBOW is distinct letters.\n\nAnother word: ""ENVOY"": E,N,V,O,Y? Also good? Envoy: E,N,V,O,Y -> no R,A,I,S? Yes.\n\nBut ELBOW is more common? Both okay.\n\nI\'ll go with ELBOW.\n\nBut note: we also have not tried T, N, D, etc? So ELBOW introduces B, O, L, W.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word with T? T is very common.\n\nFor example, position 2: METRO? Avoid M,E,T,R,O? R is excluded? METRO has R? Avoid.\n\nPosition 1: TEMPO? T,E,M,P,O -> E at position 2? And O? T,E,M,P,O? And no R,A,I,S? Check: T,E,M,P,O -> no R,A,I,S? Yes.\n\nTEMPO: T=1, E=2, M=3, P=4, O=5? So E at position 2? That\'s good because we haven\'t tried position 2.\n\nAnd TEMPO has T and E? And common letters? M,P,O.\n\nCompared to ELBOW? ELBOW has E at 1? But TEMPO has E at 2.\n\nTEMPO might be better? Because we are testing E at position 2.\n\nBut we don\'t have much preference? Both are valid.\n\nBut TEMPO has T? Which is very common? So likely to get hits? But note: we know E is in? But T might be in or not? So TEMPO tests more letters: T,E,M,P,O.\n\nElbow: E,L,B,O,W? Less common letters? But okay.\n\nI think either is fine.\n\nLet\'s choose TEMPO? Because T and O are frequent.\n\nAnother: ""BEGIN"": has B,E,G,I,N -> I is excluded? Avoid I.\n\nSo TEMPO seems solid.\n\nBut TEMPO? Is it a valid word? Yes.\n\nSo I\'ll guess TEMPO.\n\nBut let me confirm the letters: T, E, M, P, O. None of R,A,I,S? Correct? R is not in T,E,M,P,O. A,I,S are not present.\n\nAnd we have E? Yes, in position 2? Not position 5? Correct? Position 2 is new.\n\nSo better than ELBOW? Because E at a different position? And TEMPO is equally common.\n\nBut ELBOW would test different letters? Let\'s decide.\n\nI\'ll go with TEMPO.\n\nSo next guess: TEMPO.\n\nIn summary: we are avoiding R,A,I,S and including E at position 2.\n\nResponse format: <guess> TEMPO </guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess RAISE, where R(x), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(-):\n- The letters R, A, I, and S are **not** in the secret word, so they must be avoided.\n- The letter E **is** in the secret word, but not in the fifth position. Therefore, E must appear in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- The word must include E (in a position other than 5) to test its correct location.\n- It should use new, common letters to maximize information gain, avoiding R, A, I, S.\n- Candidates considered: \n  - ELBOW (E at position 1) introduces L, B, O, W.\n  - TEMPO (E at position 2) introduces T, M, P, O.\n  - TEMPO was chosen because it places E in an untested position (2) and uses high-frequency letters like T and O, which are commonly found in 5-letter words.\n\nWith TEMPO:\n- E is tested in position 2 (new spot), and T, M, P, O are introduced.\n- If E appears in position 2 in the secret word, it will show ✓; otherwise, feedback will indicate if it needs to move to 1, 3, or 4.\n- The letters T, M, P, O are all untested, so feedback will reveal new information.\n\n<guess>TEMPO</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: TEMPO -> FEEDBACK: T(x) E(-) M(-) P(x) O(-)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE -> Feedback: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
Meaning:
- R is not in the word.
- A is not in the word.
- I is not in the word.
- S is not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in the last position (position 5).

Guess 2: TEMPO -> Feedback: T(x) E(-) M(-) P(x) O(-)
Meaning:
- T is not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in the second position (since we guessed E at position 2 and got '-'). But we already knew E is in the word and not at position 5. Now we know it's also not at position 2.
- M is in the word but not in position 3 (since we guessed M at position 3 and got '-').
- P is not in the word.
- O is in the word but not in position 5.

So summarizing what we know:

Definitely not in the word: R, A, I, S, T, P
Present in the word: E, M, O
But:
- E must be in the word (from both guesses) but not at positions 2 or 5. So E must be at position 1, 3, or 4.
- M must be in the word, but not at position 3 (from the second guess), and we haven't tested position 1, 2, 4, or 5 for M? Actually, we only tried M at position 3? So M could be at 1,2,4,5.
- O must be in the word, but not at position 5 (from the second guess). We haven't tested O at other positions? Actually, we only tried O at position 5? In TEMPO, O was at position 5. So O could be at position 1,2,3,4.

Additionally, from guess 1 E was at position 5? Actually, E was at position 5? Wait, no: RAISE positions: R(1), A(2), I(3), S(4), E(5). So E at position 5 got '-', meaning E is present but not at 5. In the second guess, E at position 2 got '-', meaning E present but not at 2? Therefore, E must be at position 1, 3, or 4.

Similarly, O at position 5 was not correct? So O could be at 1,2,3,4.

M at position 3 was not correct? So M could be at 1,2,4,5.

Now, we have three known letters: E, M, O. And we don't know the other two? Actually, no: we only have five positions? So there are two more letters? But we have eliminated several common letters.

Also, note: the word cannot contain any of the excluded letters: R, A, I, S, T, P.

List of letters we must avoid: R, A, I, S, T, P.

We have E, M, O as present. So the secret word has E, M, O, and two other letters that are not in the excluded list? Since E, M, O are confirmed.

We need to find a 5-letter English word that:
- Contains E, M, and O.
- Does not contain R, A, I, S, T, P.
- Places E not in positions 2 or 5? So E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.
- Places M not in position 3? Because feedback from TEMPO: M at position 3 was '-', meaning M is present but not at 3? So M must be in 1,2,4,5.
- Places O not in position 5? So O must be in 1,2,3,4.

Additionally, we have two more letters? Since it's 5 letters? So two more? But we don't know them? So we must choose a word that includes E, M, O and two other letters that are not excluded.

Common letters not excluded: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should try to guess a word that includes E, M, O and tries to place E in one of the possible positions? And similarly for M and O.

Possible placements:
- E at position 1? Then what? We need to fit M and O accordingly? Without conflicting with their constraints.

Alternatively, we can think of words containing E, M, O.

For example, common words: ""MOVED"", ""MINCE""? But I is excluded? MINCE has I? Not allowed? Must avoid I.

""MODEL""? Has D,E,L? But MODEL: M,O,D,E,L -> but E at position 4? And O at position 2? And M at position 1? That could be? But see if the positions satisfy:
- M at position 1? We haven't tested position 1? So no prior feedback? Good? But the feedback didn't say M not at 1? So it could be.
- O at position 2? We haven't tested O at 2? In previous guess, we tested O at 5? So O can be at 2? Yes.
- E at position 4? Not 5 or 2? Good? So positions: 1:M, 2:O, 3:D, 4:E, 5:L

But what about the M constraint? We know M not at position 3? Correct? But in MODEL, M is at 1? So okay? Similarly, E at 4? Not 2 or 5? Good? O at 2? Not 5? Good.

But we need to check the letters: M,O,D,E,L? Avoided R,A,I,S,T,P? Yes? D and L are allowed? Because we haven't eliminated them? Correct? D and L not in excluded list? So yes.

Also, MODEL is a valid English word.

But is that the only? What about ""MONEY""? M,O,N,E,Y -> has N,E,Y? But E at position 4? And M at 1? O at 2? Positions: M(1),O(2),N(3),E(4),Y(5)? So:
- E at position 4? Good? (not 2 or 5)
- M at 1? We haven't tested? But feedback said M not at position 3? And 1 is not 3? So okay? But we don't know if M is at 1? But for now? Okay? Similarly, O at 2? Not tested? Can be? So okay? And avoids R,A,I,S,T,P? M,O,N,E,Y? No excluded letters? Yes? So MONEY is another candidate.

But also, ""MOLES""? M,O,L,E,S? But S is excluded? Avoid S? So cannot? MODEL has L? But no S? Correct? MODEL has D and L? MONEY has N and Y? Both valid?

Another: ""HOMED""? H,O,M,E,D -> positions: H(1),O(2),M(3),E(4),D(5)? But M at position 3? But we got feedback from TEMPO that M at position 3 is '-'? No? Wait, feedback for M: M was at position 3? And we got '-' meaning M is present but not at position 3? So we CANNOT place M at position 3? Therefore, HOMED is invalid because it puts M at 3? Correct? So must avoid position 3 for M? Thus, M in positions 1,2,4,5? So in MODEL: M at 1? Okay? MONEY: M at 1? Okay? Another possibility: M at position 4? For example, ""COME ON""? Not 5? ""IMAGE""? Has I? Avoid? ""DUMPS""? P is excluded? Avoid? ""TIMER""? T and I? Avoid? So perhaps MODEL and MONEY are candidates? But I need to consider E position as well? Both have E at 4? Acceptable? Yes? Also, O position: O at 2? Good? Or O at other positions? But O not at 5? Both satisfy? Similarly, M at 1? Okay? But we can also have M at other positions? For instance, E at position 1? So words? ""EMBED""? E,M,B,E,D -> E at 1 and 4? But positions: E(1), M(2), B(3), E(4), D(5)? Let's check:
- E at 1? We have not tested E at position 1? So no conflict? But E at 1? And E is at 4? Could be? But we know E is present? But possibly two E's? But in previous, we only know one E? But it might have more? But feedback would show if it? We don't know? But EMBED: E at 1 and 4? But we are avoiding T,P? etc? E,M,B,E,D? Avoids R,A,I,S,T,P? Yes? And M at position 2? Not 3? Good? So EMBED is also possible? Similarly, E at position 3? Words like ""CAME O"" not? ""LEMON"" but L was not tested? But avoid? Wait, LEMON has L,E,M,O,N? But E at position 2? And we tried E at position 2? In guess 2? TEMPO had E at position 2? And it was '-'? So E cannot be at position 2? So we cannot put E at 2? Therefore, LEMON has E at 2? Not allowed? So skip.

Another E at 3: ""DEMON""? D,E,M,O,N? Positions: D(1),E(2),M(3),O(4),N(5)? But E at position 2? Which we tried? And we know E not at 2? So cannot? Similarly, ""GIVEN""? Has I? Avoid? ""LEVEL""? Has E, E? But E at position 1? Then at 3? Then E at 1? Positions: L,E,V,E,L? Not? Actually? L(1), E(2), V(3), E(4), L(5)? But E at 2? Forbidden? So skip.

So E must be at 1, 3, or 4? But not at 2? So position 3? E at position 3? Words? ""SCENE""? Has S,C? S excluded? Avoid? ""DEUCE""? Has E? But position 1 and 4? Or? D,E,U,C,E? Positions: D(1),E(2),U(3),C(4),E(5)? E at 2? Forbidden? And E at 5? Also forbidden? We know E not at 2 or 5? So DEUCE places E at 2 and 5? Not good? Skip.

Another? ""MEDAL""? M,E,D,A,L? But A excluded? Avoid? ""BEVEL""? B,E,V,E,L? E at 2 and 4? E at 2? Forbidden? Skip.

So E at position 3? Difficult to think? Let's list possibilities:

Option 1: E at position 1? Words: EMBER? But R? Avoid? EXCEL? E at 1 and 4? But we tried EXCEL? Not? We didn't? But in previous? Or? EXCEL: E,X,C,E,L? But X,C,L? Avoid R,A,I,S,T,P? E,X,C,E,L? No? So acceptable? But E at 1 and 4? And X? C? L? But we don't know if X? Actually? Positions: 
- EMBED: E at 1 and 4? Or EMBOSS? But O? But letters: E,M,B,O,S? S excluded? Avoid? EMBED: E(1),M(2),B(3),E(4),D(5)? This word: 
- E at position 1: and E at position 4? But note: we have M at position 2? And O not needed? But the word must contain O? Because from feedback, O must be present? From second guess feedback: O at position 5 was '-'? Meaning O is present? So O must be in the word? So EMBED does not have O? So invalid? Because O must be present? Similarly, MONEY has O? MODEL has O? We must include O? And M? And E? So all three must be in the word? Therefore, EMBED is invalid because it lacks O? Correct? Similarly, EXCEL: E,X,C,E,L? No O? And no M? Or? But the secret word has M? So EXCEL would not contain M? But feedback from TEMPO says M is in the word? So we must have M? Therefore, we must choose words that contain E, M, O? And two others? Not excluded letters? So EMBED cannot be used? Because no O? Therefore, option E at position 1? With E,M,O? Words like ""EMOTE""? E,M,O,T,E? T excluded? Avoid T? Cannot? ""MOGUL""? Not E? Must have E? So hard? Maybe not many words with E at beginning and M and O? And must avoid T? 

Therefore, E at position 3 or 4? Perhaps position 4 is easier? As we had MODEL: M,O,D,E,L -> E at 4? And M at 1? O at 2? MONEY: M,O,N,E,Y -> E at 4? Etc? All with E at 4? Also, position 3? E at position 3? Words: ""COMET""? But T excluded? Avoid T? ""DOME O"" not? ""HOMED""? But M at position 3? Forbidden? ""CUMIN""? Not E? Must have? And avoid U? But U allowed? But E must be at 3? Let's think: ""DINER"" has I? Avoid? ""OUNCE""? O,U,N,C,E? Positions: O(1),U(2),N(3),C(4),E(5)? E at 5? We know E not at 5? Skip? ""UNMET""? U,N,M,E,T? But T excluded? Avoid? ""FLUME""? F,L,U,M,E? E at 5? Skip? Not 5. ""METAL"" T? Avoid? Etc? So perhaps not? So E at position 4? With M and O? Words: as MODEL, MONEY.

Another: ""JUMPS""? But P? Avoid? ""GLOBE""? G,L,O,B,E? E at position 5? Not allowed? Skip? ""CHOSE""? No M? Must have M? ""MONTH""? T? Avoid? So MODEL and MONEY? Seems main candidates.

Now, we need to guess? But both satisfy? Also, MODEL: M,O,D,E,L? MONEY: M,O,N,E,Y? Both are valid words? Now, which is better? We need to test the letters D and L? Or N and Y? Since we haven't tested? Also, note that in MODEL, E is at position 4? Which we haven't tested? Similarly? In both? So feedback will tell us? Perhaps we choose MODEL because it has D which is common? Or MONEY? But N is common? So evenly? But note: there could be others? Like ""COMBO""? But C,O,M,B,O? O at position 2 and 5? But O not at 5? So cannot? Because O must not be at 5? So position 5? O at 5 would be wrong? But not necessarily? Feedback for O was '-' at position 5? Meaning O present? But not at that position? So COMBO would place O at 5? Which we know is wrong? So feedback would be minus? So better not? Or ""OWLET""? O,W,L,E,T? Avoid T? Cannot? So MODEL and MONEY? Another: ""MODEM""? But M at position 1 and 4? And E at 3? Position: M(1),O(2),D(3),E(4),M(5)? Now, E at 4? Acceptable? Similarly, O at 2? M at position 1? And also at position 5? But we know M at position 3? But no constraint? Actually, M at position 3 is forbidden? But here M is at 1 and 5? So okay? And avoids R,A,I,S,T,P? Yes? And E at 4? Good? And O at 2? Good? So MODEM is also valid? Similarly, we could have MODEL, MODEM, MONEY.

But MODEM has two M's? Possible? The secret word might have duplicate letters? For example? But we don't know? So both MODEL and MODEM? But MODEL: E at 4? MODEM: E at 4? Same? So MODEM: M,O,D,E,M? But position 5 is M? So O in position 2? We haven't tested O at 2? Similarly? So okay? But perhaps we should choose one? To test? Since O and M are flexible? 

Moreover, we also need to consider the constraints for O: O not at 5? Good? All leave O at 1,2,3,4? Similarly M not at 3? In MODEL M at 1? In MODEM M at 1 and 5? In MONEY M at 1? All avoid M at 3? So okay? 

So we can guess MODEL? Or MONEY? Let's choose MODEL? Because we can then test D and L? Whereas MONEY tests N and Y? Y might be less frequent? So MODEL? 

But wait, what about the E position? In MODEL, E is at position 4? Which we haven't tried? If it's not correct, we'll know? Similarly? 

Alternatively, we might guess a word that has E at position 3? But we haven't? Maybe not necessary? Because E can only be at 1,3,4? And we haven't ruled out position 1? But at position 1? With E,M,O? Hard to find? Words like ""EMBOW""? E,M,B,O,W? Positions: E(1),M(2),B(3),O(4),W(5)? So E at 1? M at 2? O at 4? All acceptable? Since we know E not at 2 and not at 5? M not at 3? O not at 5? And avoided R,A,I,S,T,P? So EMBOW? Is it a word? Embow means to furnish? But valid? Might not be common? But in Wordle, valid words? Or ELBOW? But we didn't choose it earlier? But ELBOW has E at position 1? And M? Does it? No, ELBOW: E,L,B,O,W? But missing M? Because secret word must have M? So ELBOW cannot be? Therefore, EMBOW? E,M,B,O,W? This includes E at 1? M at 2? O at 4? And letters? Avoid excluded? Yes? But we haven't tested E at 1? M at 2? etc? So EMBOW? Valid? But to be safe? Stick with common words? 

Given that MODEL is a common word? So I'll go with MODEL? 

So next guess? MODEL.

But let me confirm MODEL? 
M,O,D,E,L? 
Positions:
1: M? Not tested? Feedback? 
2: O? Not tested? 
3: D? New letter? Not tested? 
4: E? Testing E at position 4? Which we know E not at 2 or 5? So if E is at 4, it might be correct? Or if not, feedback tell? 
5: L? New letter? 

Also, it has O? And M? 

So feedback could help? 

Therefore, I choose MODEL? 

So <guess> MODEL </guess>
</think>
### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Current Knowns from Feedback:**
   - **Excluded Letters:** R, A, I, S, T, P (not in the word at all).
   - **Letters in the Word:** E, M, O (confirmed present).
   - **Constraints on Positions:**
     - **E:** Cannot be at position 2 or 5 (from previous guesses). Must be at position 1, 3, or 4.
     - **M:** Cannot be at position 3 (from Guess 2 feedback). Can be at position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
     - **O:** Cannot be at position 5 (from Guess 2 feedback). Can be at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

2. **Word Requirements:**
   - Must include **E**, **M**, and **O**.
   - Must avoid excluded letters (R, A, I, S, T, P).
   - Two additional letters are unknown but must be from the remaining English alphabet (B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).
   - E must be in position 1, 3, or 4; M not in 3; O not in 5.

3. **Possible Words Considered:**
   - **MODEL:** Positions: M(1), O(2), D(3), E(4), L(5). Satisfies all constraints:
     - E at position 4 (not 2 or 5), M at 1 (not 3), O at 2 (not 5).
     - Letters D and L are untested and not excluded.
     - Valid 5-letter word meeting criteria.
   - **MONEY:** Positions: M(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), Y(5). Also valid but less common; Y may be rarer. Similar reasoning.
   - **MODEM:** Positions: M(1), O(2), D(3), E(4), M(5). Valid but less common due to double M.
   - **Other options rejected**:
     - EMBOW: E(1), M(2), B(3), O(4), W(5). Less common word; tests E at position 1.
     - MONEY/COMBO/others: MONEY valid but MODEL prioritized (similar test coverage with more common letters).

4. **Why MODEL?**
   - Tests E specifically at position 4, narrowing down possible locations.
   - Introduces new letters D and L, maximizing information.
   - Avoids all excluded letters and satisfies positional constraints.
   - Common English word, ideal for efficient guessing.

5. **Expectations:**
   - Feedback will confirm/refute positions for E, M, O and reveal D/L presence/positions.
   - If E is at position 4, it would show ✓; otherwise, feedback guides next attempt.

<guess>MODEL</guess>",MODEL,"We are given feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE -> Feedback: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
Meaning:
- R is not in the word.
- A is not in the word.
- I is not in the word.
- S is not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in the last position (position 5).

Guess 2: TEMPO -> Feedback: T(x) E(-) M(-) P(x) O(-)
Meaning:
- T is not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in the second position (since we guessed E at position 2 and got '-'). But we already knew E is in the word and not at position 5. Now we know it's also not at position 2.
- M is in the word but not in position 3 (since we guessed M at position 3 and got '-').
- P is not in the word.
- O is in the word but not in position 5.

So summarizing what we know:

Definitely not in the word: R, A, I, S, T, P
Present in the word: E, M, O
But:
- E must be in the word (from both guesses) but not at positions 2 or 5. So E must be at position 1, 3, or 4.
- M must be in the word, but not at position 3 (from the second guess), and we haven't tested position 1, 2, 4, or 5 for M? Actually, we only tried M at position 3? So M could be at 1,2,4,5.
- O must be in the word, but not at position 5 (from the second guess). We haven't tested O at other positions? Actually, we only tried O at position 5? In TEMPO, O was at position 5. So O could be at position 1,2,3,4.

Additionally, from guess 1 E was at position 5? Actually, E was at position 5? Wait, no: RAISE positions: R(1), A(2), I(3), S(4), E(5). So E at position 5 got '-', meaning E is present but not at 5. In the second guess, E at position 2 got '-', meaning E present but not at 2? Therefore, E must be at position 1, 3, or 4.

Similarly, O at position 5 was not correct? So O could be at 1,2,3,4.

M at position 3 was not correct? So M could be at 1,2,4,5.

Now, we have three known letters: E, M, O. And we don't know the other two? Actually, no: we only have five positions? So there are two more letters? But we have eliminated several common letters.

Also, note: the word cannot contain any of the excluded letters: R, A, I, S, T, P.

List of letters we must avoid: R, A, I, S, T, P.

We have E, M, O as present. So the secret word has E, M, O, and two other letters that are not in the excluded list? Since E, M, O are confirmed.

We need to find a 5-letter English word that:
- Contains E, M, and O.
- Does not contain R, A, I, S, T, P.
- Places E not in positions 2 or 5? So E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.
- Places M not in position 3? Because feedback from TEMPO: M at position 3 was '-', meaning M is present but not at 3? So M must be in 1,2,4,5.
- Places O not in position 5? So O must be in 1,2,3,4.

Additionally, we have two more letters? Since it's 5 letters? So two more? But we don't know them? So we must choose a word that includes E, M, O and two other letters that are not excluded.

Common letters not excluded: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should try to guess a word that includes E, M, O and tries to place E in one of the possible positions? And similarly for M and O.

Possible placements:
- E at position 1? Then what? We need to fit M and O accordingly? Without conflicting with their constraints.

Alternatively, we can think of words containing E, M, O.

For example, common words: ""MOVED"", ""MINCE""? But I is excluded? MINCE has I? Not allowed? Must avoid I.

""MODEL""? Has D,E,L? But MODEL: M,O,D,E,L -> but E at position 4? And O at position 2? And M at position 1? That could be? But see if the positions satisfy:
- M at position 1? We haven't tested position 1? So no prior feedback? Good? But the feedback didn't say M not at 1? So it could be.
- O at position 2? We haven't tested O at 2? In previous guess, we tested O at 5? So O can be at 2? Yes.
- E at position 4? Not 5 or 2? Good? So positions: 1:M, 2:O, 3:D, 4:E, 5:L

But what about the M constraint? We know M not at position 3? Correct? But in MODEL, M is at 1? So okay? Similarly, E at 4? Not 2 or 5? Good? O at 2? Not 5? Good.

But we need to check the letters: M,O,D,E,L? Avoided R,A,I,S,T,P? Yes? D and L are allowed? Because we haven't eliminated them? Correct? D and L not in excluded list? So yes.

Also, MODEL is a valid English word.

But is that the only? What about ""MONEY""? M,O,N,E,Y -> has N,E,Y? But E at position 4? And M at 1? O at 2? Positions: M(1),O(2),N(3),E(4),Y(5)? So:
- E at position 4? Good? (not 2 or 5)
- M at 1? We haven't tested? But feedback said M not at position 3? And 1 is not 3? So okay? But we don't know if M is at 1? But for now? Okay? Similarly, O at 2? Not tested? Can be? So okay? And avoids R,A,I,S,T,P? M,O,N,E,Y? No excluded letters? Yes? So MONEY is another candidate.

But also, ""MOLES""? M,O,L,E,S? But S is excluded? Avoid S? So cannot? MODEL has L? But no S? Correct? MODEL has D and L? MONEY has N and Y? Both valid?

Another: ""HOMED""? H,O,M,E,D -> positions: H(1),O(2),M(3),E(4),D(5)? But M at position 3? But we got feedback from TEMPO that M at position 3 is '-'? No? Wait, feedback for M: M was at position 3? And we got '-' meaning M is present but not at position 3? So we CANNOT place M at position 3? Therefore, HOMED is invalid because it puts M at 3? Correct? So must avoid position 3 for M? Thus, M in positions 1,2,4,5? So in MODEL: M at 1? Okay? MONEY: M at 1? Okay? Another possibility: M at position 4? For example, ""COME ON""? Not 5? ""IMAGE""? Has I? Avoid? ""DUMPS""? P is excluded? Avoid? ""TIMER""? T and I? Avoid? So perhaps MODEL and MONEY are candidates? But I need to consider E position as well? Both have E at 4? Acceptable? Yes? Also, O position: O at 2? Good? Or O at other positions? But O not at 5? Both satisfy? Similarly, M at 1? Okay? But we can also have M at other positions? For instance, E at position 1? So words? ""EMBED""? E,M,B,E,D -> E at 1 and 4? But positions: E(1), M(2), B(3), E(4), D(5)? Let's check:
- E at 1? We have not tested E at position 1? So no conflict? But E at 1? And E is at 4? Could be? But we know E is present? But possibly two E's? But in previous, we only know one E? But it might have more? But feedback would show if it? We don't know? But EMBED: E at 1 and 4? But we are avoiding T,P? etc? E,M,B,E,D? Avoids R,A,I,S,T,P? Yes? And M at position 2? Not 3? Good? So EMBED is also possible? Similarly, E at position 3? Words like ""CAME O"" not? ""LEMON"" but L was not tested? But avoid? Wait, LEMON has L,E,M,O,N? But E at position 2? And we tried E at position 2? In guess 2? TEMPO had E at position 2? And it was '-'? So E cannot be at position 2? So we cannot put E at 2? Therefore, LEMON has E at 2? Not allowed? So skip.

Another E at 3: ""DEMON""? D,E,M,O,N? Positions: D(1),E(2),M(3),O(4),N(5)? But E at position 2? Which we tried? And we know E not at 2? So cannot? Similarly, ""GIVEN""? Has I? Avoid? ""LEVEL""? Has E, E? But E at position 1? Then at 3? Then E at 1? Positions: L,E,V,E,L? Not? Actually? L(1), E(2), V(3), E(4), L(5)? But E at 2? Forbidden? So skip.

So E must be at 1, 3, or 4? But not at 2? So position 3? E at position 3? Words? ""SCENE""? Has S,C? S excluded? Avoid? ""DEUCE""? Has E? But position 1 and 4? Or? D,E,U,C,E? Positions: D(1),E(2),U(3),C(4),E(5)? E at 2? Forbidden? And E at 5? Also forbidden? We know E not at 2 or 5? So DEUCE places E at 2 and 5? Not good? Skip.

Another? ""MEDAL""? M,E,D,A,L? But A excluded? Avoid? ""BEVEL""? B,E,V,E,L? E at 2 and 4? E at 2? Forbidden? Skip.

So E at position 3? Difficult to think? Let's list possibilities:

Option 1: E at position 1? Words: EMBER? But R? Avoid? EXCEL? E at 1 and 4? But we tried EXCEL? Not? We didn't? But in previous? Or? EXCEL: E,X,C,E,L? But X,C,L? Avoid R,A,I,S,T,P? E,X,C,E,L? No? So acceptable? But E at 1 and 4? And X? C? L? But we don't know if X? Actually? Positions: 
- EMBED: E at 1 and 4? Or EMBOSS? But O? But letters: E,M,B,O,S? S excluded? Avoid? EMBED: E(1),M(2),B(3),E(4),D(5)? This word: 
- E at position 1: and E at position 4? But note: we have M at position 2? And O not needed? But the word must contain O? Because from feedback, O must be present? From second guess feedback: O at position 5 was '-'? Meaning O is present? So O must be in the word? So EMBED does not have O? So invalid? Because O must be present? Similarly, MONEY has O? MODEL has O? We must include O? And M? And E? So all three must be in the word? Therefore, EMBED is invalid because it lacks O? Correct? Similarly, EXCEL: E,X,C,E,L? No O? And no M? Or? But the secret word has M? So EXCEL would not contain M? But feedback from TEMPO says M is in the word? So we must have M? Therefore, we must choose words that contain E, M, O? And two others? Not excluded letters? So EMBED cannot be used? Because no O? Therefore, option E at position 1? With E,M,O? Words like ""EMOTE""? E,M,O,T,E? T excluded? Avoid T? Cannot? ""MOGUL""? Not E? Must have E? So hard? Maybe not many words with E at beginning and M and O? And must avoid T? 

Therefore, E at position 3 or 4? Perhaps position 4 is easier? As we had MODEL: M,O,D,E,L -> E at 4? And M at 1? O at 2? MONEY: M,O,N,E,Y -> E at 4? Etc? All with E at 4? Also, position 3? E at position 3? Words: ""COMET""? But T excluded? Avoid T? ""DOME O"" not? ""HOMED""? But M at position 3? Forbidden? ""CUMIN""? Not E? Must have? And avoid U? But U allowed? But E must be at 3? Let's think: ""DINER"" has I? Avoid? ""OUNCE""? O,U,N,C,E? Positions: O(1),U(2),N(3),C(4),E(5)? E at 5? We know E not at 5? Skip? ""UNMET""? U,N,M,E,T? But T excluded? Avoid? ""FLUME""? F,L,U,M,E? E at 5? Skip? Not 5. ""METAL"" T? Avoid? Etc? So perhaps not? So E at position 4? With M and O? Words: as MODEL, MONEY.

Another: ""JUMPS""? But P? Avoid? ""GLOBE""? G,L,O,B,E? E at position 5? Not allowed? Skip? ""CHOSE""? No M? Must have M? ""MONTH""? T? Avoid? So MODEL and MONEY? Seems main candidates.

Now, we need to guess? But both satisfy? Also, MODEL: M,O,D,E,L? MONEY: M,O,N,E,Y? Both are valid words? Now, which is better? We need to test the letters D and L? Or N and Y? Since we haven't tested? Also, note that in MODEL, E is at position 4? Which we haven't tested? Similarly? In both? So feedback will tell us? Perhaps we choose MODEL because it has D which is common? Or MONEY? But N is common? So evenly? But note: there could be others? Like ""COMBO""? But C,O,M,B,O? O at position 2 and 5? But O not at 5? So cannot? Because O must not be at 5? So position 5? O at 5 would be wrong? But not necessarily? Feedback for O was '-' at position 5? Meaning O present? But not at that position? So COMBO would place O at 5? Which we know is wrong? So feedback would be minus? So better not? Or ""OWLET""? O,W,L,E,T? Avoid T? Cannot? So MODEL and MONEY? Another: ""MODEM""? But M at position 1 and 4? And E at 3? Position: M(1),O(2),D(3),E(4),M(5)? Now, E at 4? Acceptable? Similarly, O at 2? M at position 1? And also at position 5? But we know M at position 3? But no constraint? Actually, M at position 3 is forbidden? But here M is at 1 and 5? So okay? And avoids R,A,I,S,T,P? Yes? And E at 4? Good? And O at 2? Good? So MODEM is also valid? Similarly, we could have MODEL, MODEM, MONEY.

But MODEM has two M's? Possible? The secret word might have duplicate letters? For example? But we don't know? So both MODEL and MODEM? But MODEL: E at 4? MODEM: E at 4? Same? So MODEM: M,O,D,E,M? But position 5 is M? So O in position 2? We haven't tested O at 2? Similarly? So okay? But perhaps we should choose one? To test? Since O and M are flexible? 

Moreover, we also need to consider the constraints for O: O not at 5? Good? All leave O at 1,2,3,4? Similarly M not at 3? In MODEL M at 1? In MODEM M at 1 and 5? In MONEY M at 1? All avoid M at 3? So okay? 

So we can guess MODEL? Or MONEY? Let's choose MODEL? Because we can then test D and L? Whereas MONEY tests N and Y? Y might be less frequent? So MODEL? 

But wait, what about the E position? In MODEL, E is at position 4? Which we haven't tried? If it's not correct, we'll know? Similarly? 

Alternatively, we might guess a word that has E at position 3? But we haven't? Maybe not necessary? Because E can only be at 1,3,4? And we haven't ruled out position 1? But at position 1? With E,M,O? Hard to find? Words like ""EMBOW""? E,M,B,O,W? Positions: E(1),M(2),B(3),O(4),W(5)? So E at 1? M at 2? O at 4? All acceptable? Since we know E not at 2 and not at 5? M not at 3? O not at 5? And avoided R,A,I,S,T,P? So EMBOW? Is it a word? Embow means to furnish? But valid? Might not be common? But in Wordle, valid words? Or ELBOW? But we didn't choose it earlier? But ELBOW has E at position 1? And M? Does it? No, ELBOW: E,L,B,O,W? But missing M? Because secret word must have M? So ELBOW cannot be? Therefore, EMBOW? E,M,B,O,W? This includes E at 1? M at 2? O at 4? And letters? Avoid excluded? Yes? But we haven't tested E at 1? M at 2? etc? So EMBOW? Valid? But to be safe? Stick with common words? 

Given that MODEL is a common word? So I'll go with MODEL? 

So next guess? MODEL.

But let me confirm MODEL? 
M,O,D,E,L? 
Positions:
1: M? Not tested? Feedback? 
2: O? Not tested? 
3: D? New letter? Not tested? 
4: E? Testing E at position 4? Which we know E not at 2 or 5? So if E is at 4, it might be correct? Or if not, feedback tell? 
5: L? New letter? 

Also, it has O? And M? 

So feedback could help? 

Therefore, I choose MODEL? 

So <guess> MODEL </guess>### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Current Knowns from Feedback:**
   - **Excluded Letters:** R, A, I, S, T, P (not in the word at all).
   - **Letters in the Word:** E, M, O (confirmed present).
   - **Constraints on Positions:**
     - **E:** Cannot be at position 2 or 5 (from previous guesses). Must be at position 1, 3, or 4.
     - **M:** Cannot be at position 3 (from Guess 2 feedback). Can be at position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
     - **O:** Cannot be at position 5 (from Guess 2 feedback). Can be at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

2. **Word Requirements:**
   - Must include **E**, **M**, and **O**.
   - Must avoid excluded letters (R, A, I, S, T, P).
   - Two additional letters are unknown but must be from the remaining English alphabet (B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).
   - E must be in position 1, 3, or 4; M not in 3; O not in 5.

3. **Possible Words Considered:**
   - **MODEL:** Positions: M(1), O(2), D(3), E(4), L(5). Satisfies all constraints:
     - E at position 4 (not 2 or 5), M at 1 (not 3), O at 2 (not 5).
     - Letters D and L are untested and not excluded.
     - Valid 5-letter word meeting criteria.
   - **MONEY:** Positions: M(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), Y(5). Also valid but less common; Y may be rarer. Similar reasoning.
   - **MODEM:** Positions: M(1), O(2), D(3), E(4), M(5). Valid but less common due to double M.
   - **Other options rejected**:
     - EMBOW: E(1), M(2), B(3), O(4), W(5). Less common word; tests E at position 1.
     - MONEY/COMBO/others: MONEY valid but MODEL prioritized (similar test coverage with more common letters).

4. **Why MODEL?**
   - Tests E specifically at position 4, narrowing down possible locations.
   - Introduces new letters D and L, maximizing information.
   - Avoids all excluded letters and satisfies positional constraints.
   - Common English word, ideal for efficient guessing.

5. **Expectations:**
   - Feedback will confirm/refute positions for E, M, O and reveal D/L presence/positions.
   - If E is at position 4, it would show ✓; otherwise, feedback guides next attempt.",Guess 3: MODEL -> FEEDBACK: M(-) O(✓) D(x) E(✓) L(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,golem,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has common letters: we want at least two vowels and some frequent consonants.
 The word ""ROAST"" is a good candidate because:
   - It contains 'R', 'O', 'A', 'S', 'T' — all common letters.
   - It has two vowels ('O' and 'A') and three consonants.

 Alternatively, we can consider ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"". But let's go with ""ROAST"".

 However, note that the example in the rules used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", but we are free to choose.

 Another popular choice is ""RAISE"". It has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).

 But let's stick with a balanced word: ""ROAST"".

 However, to maximize the information, we might also consider ""CRATE"" or ""SLANT"". 

 After some thought, I recall that ""RAISE"" is often recommended because it has three vowels and common consonants.

 Let me choose ""RAISE"" for the first guess.

 But note: the example secret word was ""BRISK"", and if we guess ""RAISE"", we would get:
   R: present but in wrong position? (because in BRISK, R is at position 2, but in RAISE it's at position 1) -> so R would be marked as '-'
   A: not in BRISK -> 'x'
   I: in BRISK at position 3, and in RAISE at position 3 -> so I would be marked as '✓'
   S: in BRISK at position 4, and in RAISE at position 4? -> but in RAISE, S is at position 4, and in BRISK S is at position 4? Actually, BRISK is B-R-I-S-K, so S is at position 4. So S would be '✓'
   E: not in BRISK -> 'x'

 So the feedback would be: R(-), A(x), I(✓), S(✓), E(x)

 That gives two correct and one present. But we are just starting.

 However, for the first guess, we don't have any information. So any word is acceptable.

 I will go with ""RAISE"".

 But note: the problem says to return the guess in the specified format.

 Let me output: <guess> RAISE </guess>For the first guess, I chose ""RAISE"" because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which helps test frequently used letters. This increases the chances of getting useful feedback about the secret word's letters and their positions.

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: RAISE -> R(x), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(-)

Interpretation:
- R, A, I, S are not in the secret word at all (marked by x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (marked by -).

So we know:
- The secret word contains the letter E, but not in the fifth position (since we guessed E at the end and it's wrong position).
- The letters R, A, I, S are not in the word. So we must avoid these letters in our next guess.

Since E is in the word but not at the end, let's think about possible positions for E. It could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

We also know that the word does not contain R, A, I, S. Therefore, we must use other letters.

Now, we need to choose a new word that:
- Is 5 letters long and a valid English word.
- Does not contain R, A, I, S.
- Contains the letter E, but not at position 5 (since we already tried that and it was wrong). So E must be at positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

To maximize information, we might want to try E in a different position and use other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

We have used: R, A, I, S, E. So avoid R, A, I, S, but we can use E (if we put it in a new position) and new letters.

Common letters we haven't tried: T, N, O, L, U, D, C, M, etc.

Good strategy: try a word with E in a different position and test other vowels? But note: we have eliminated A and I, so the remaining vowels are O, U (and sometimes Y). But Y is less common.

We must have E in the word somewhere, but we don't know where. So we can try E at the beginning or in the middle.

Let me list some words that have E but not in the fifth position and do not contain R, A, I, S.

Possible positions for E:
- Position 1: E _ _ _ _
- Position 2: _ E _ _ _
- Position 3: _ _ E _ _
- Position 4: _ _ _ E _

We also want to use other common consonants.

Word ideas:
- Position 1: E ... e.g., ""ELBOW"", ""ENJOY"" -> but must be 5 letters and without R,A,I,S.
  ELBOW: E, L, B, O, W -> no R,A,I,S? Check: E, L, B, O, W. Good.
- Position 2: ... e.g., ""LEMON"", ""DEPOT"", ""TEMPO"" -> LEMON: L,E,M,O,N -> avoid? L,E,M,O,N: no R,A,I,S? Yes, but we don't know if these are in the word. We want to test new letters.
- Position 3: ... e.g., ""HOTEL"" -> H,O,T,E,L -> has E at position 4? Wait, H-O-T-E-L, E is at position 4? Actually: H=1, O=2, T=3, E=4, L=5 -> but we must place E not in 5? So position 4 is okay? But in our previous guess E was in position 5 and was wrong position, but we don't know about position 4 yet. However, note that the feedback for E was a minus, meaning E is in the word but not in position 5. But it could be in position 4? Actually, position 4 or others. So we can try E in position 4? Yes.

But let's avoid confusion: the secret word contains E, so we must include E in every guess until we know its position? Actually we don't have to, but we should because we know it's present and we haven't located its position yet. So it's efficient to include E again in a different position.

So I think including E again is good.

Try E in position 1: so words starting with E.

Possible words: ECHOS, ECLAT, EDIFY, EGRET, EJECT, ELBOW, ELEGY, ELEMENT? Wait 5 letters: ELBOW, EPOXY, ETHER, EXCEL? But must avoid R,A,I,S.

So:
- ELBOW: E, L, B, O, W -> all new letters? None of L,B,O,W have been tested? Correct? Yes. So this would test E at position 1 and L,B,O,W.

Similarly, other words: ENDOW, ENJOY? ENJOY: E,N,J,O,Y -> no R,A,I,S? J and Y might be less common.

But ELBOW seems like a good word: common and tests E in a new position.

Alternatively, position 2: let's think of words with E in position 2: e.g., ""HELLO"" -> but H,E,L,L,O. We don't know H and O. But double L? We want to test more distinct letters if possible.

Position 3: words like ""YETI"" not 5 letters? ""BELLE"" -> double L? ""FREED"" -> has R, we cannot use R. Must avoid R. So words with E in position 3: e.g., ""CREPE"" has R? CREPE: C,R,E,P,E -> R is excluded. No. ""PLUME"": P,L,U,M,E -> E at position 5? But we cannot use E at position 5? Wait, we can use it because we are trying a different position? Actually, we can use it again at position 5? It's allowed because we haven't confirmed it's not there? Actually, we don't know: the feedback just said the E is present but not in position 5. So if we put E again at position 5, we know it will be a minus again? Because if the word has E not in 5, then E at 5 will still be wrong. So it's redundant? So to learn new positions, we might avoid E at position 5.

So we should put E at positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Position 4: words like ""THYME"": T,H,Y,M,E -> but E is at position 5? Wait, no: T=1, H=2, Y=3, M=4, E=5 -> that puts E at 5 again. So bad.

Another: ""BEADS""? No, has A? Avoid A.

So let's look for words with E at position 4: e.g., ""MAPLE"" has A. Avoid. ""TOWEL"": T,O,W,E,L -> E at position 4? T(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), L(5). So that's good: E not in 5? But we don't mind position 5 for L? We want E at 4 to test.

Another: ""CABLE"" -> C=1, A=2? Avoid A.

""NOBLE"": N,O,B,L,E -> E is at position 5? N=1,O=2,B=3,L=4,E=5 -> again position 5. So bad.

Actually, position 4 would be the fourth letter, so we need a word where the fourth letter is E, but the fifth is not E and not a forbidden letter.

Example: ""BELLE"" -> B,E,L,L,E? Positions: B=1, E=2? We want letter 4. Another: ""TWEEN""? T,W,E,E,N? E at position 3? Not 4.

Perhaps: ""PRIDE""? Avoid R,I. ""BRIDE""? Avoid B? No R,A,I,S, but B is allowed? ""BRIDE"" has I? Avoid I.

Hard to find position 4. So maybe position 4 is not common? So stick with position 1 or 2.

Position 2: words like in position 2: ""CELLO"": C,E,L,L,O -> double L.

""DENIM"": D,E,N,I,M -> has I? Avoid I.

Words with E in position 2: ""VEIL"" not 5? ""BEIGE"": B,E,I,G,E -> I is excluded? Avoid I.

""DEUCE"": D,E,U,C,E -> E at position 2 and 5? But we are avoiding position 5? But this has two E's? Permissible? Maybe? But we know there's an E? But we don't know if there are two? So DEUCE: D,E,U,C,E -> so E at position 5? We want to avoid position 5? But if the word only has one E and it's not at 5, then putting E at 5 again will be minus? But putting E at 2 might be correct or minus.

But to avoid redundancy? Better to put E at a position we haven't tried? We tried position 5, so try 2? So DEUCE? But DEUCE has E at 5? It's tricky.

Alternatively: ""MEATY"" has A? Avoid A.

So let's go back to position 1: 

ELBOW: E,L,B,O,W -> valid and common letters.

Other words: EIGHT? Has G,H,T? But E,I,G,H,T? But we must avoid I? EIGHT has I? Avoid.

ECLAT? E,C,L,A,T -> has A? Avoid A.

So ELBOW seems good: E L B O W -> no A, R, I, S.

Another common word: ""EXCEL""? But E,X,C,E,L -> E at positions 1 and 4? And L at end. But E at 4? We haven't tried. But also has E at 1? Actually, EXCEL: E=1, X=2, C=3, E=4, L=5 -> E at 1 and 4? And L at 5. Since we know E is in the word, we can test E at two positions? But note that if the word has only one E, then one of these will be misplaced unless it hits exactly. But EXCEL contains A,R,I,S? Let's check: E, X, C, E, L? None of R,A,I,S. So acceptable? Yes.

But let me avoid double E? Because it might confuse? But possible. Actually, in ELBOW we have distinct letters? Yes.

So I think ELBOW is a safe bet to test E at the beginning and other common letters.

But we must remember that the word might have duplicate letters? But we haven't encountered any indication yet? So ELBOW is distinct letters.

Another word: ""ENVOY"": E,N,V,O,Y? Also good? Envoy: E,N,V,O,Y -> no R,A,I,S? Yes.

But ELBOW is more common? Both okay.

I'll go with ELBOW.

But note: we also have not tried T, N, D, etc? So ELBOW introduces B, O, L, W.

Alternatively, we can try a word with T? T is very common.

For example, position 2: METRO? Avoid M,E,T,R,O? R is excluded? METRO has R? Avoid.

Position 1: TEMPO? T,E,M,P,O -> E at position 2? And O? T,E,M,P,O? And no R,A,I,S? Check: T,E,M,P,O -> no R,A,I,S? Yes.

TEMPO: T=1, E=2, M=3, P=4, O=5? So E at position 2? That's good because we haven't tried position 2.

And TEMPO has T and E? And common letters? M,P,O.

Compared to ELBOW? ELBOW has E at 1? But TEMPO has E at 2.

TEMPO might be better? Because we are testing E at position 2.

But we don't have much preference? Both are valid.

But TEMPO has T? Which is very common? So likely to get hits? But note: we know E is in? But T might be in or not? So TEMPO tests more letters: T,E,M,P,O.

Elbow: E,L,B,O,W? Less common letters? But okay.

I think either is fine.

Let's choose TEMPO? Because T and O are frequent.

Another: ""BEGIN"": has B,E,G,I,N -> I is excluded? Avoid I.

So TEMPO seems solid.

But TEMPO? Is it a valid word? Yes.

So I'll guess TEMPO.

But let me confirm the letters: T, E, M, P, O. None of R,A,I,S? Correct? R is not in T,E,M,P,O. A,I,S are not present.

And we have E? Yes, in position 2? Not position 5? Correct? Position 2 is new.

So better than ELBOW? Because E at a different position? And TEMPO is equally common.

But ELBOW would test different letters? Let's decide.

I'll go with TEMPO.

So next guess: TEMPO.

In summary: we are avoiding R,A,I,S and including E at position 2.

Response format: <guess> TEMPO </guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess RAISE, where R(x), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(-):
- The letters R, A, I, and S are **not** in the secret word, so they must be avoided.
- The letter E **is** in the secret word, but not in the fifth position. Therefore, E must appear in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

For the next guess:
- The word must include E (in a position other than 5) to test its correct location.
- It should use new, common letters to maximize information gain, avoiding R, A, I, S.
- Candidates considered: 
  - ELBOW (E at position 1) introduces L, B, O, W.
  - TEMPO (E at position 2) introduces T, M, P, O.
  - TEMPO was chosen because it places E in an untested position (2) and uses high-frequency letters like T and O, which are commonly found in 5-letter words.

With TEMPO:
- E is tested in position 2 (new spot), and T, M, P, O are introduced.
- If E appears in position 2 in the secret word, it will show ✓; otherwise, feedback will indicate if it needs to move to 1, 3, or 4.
- The letters T, M, P, O are all untested, so feedback will reveal new information.

<guess>TEMPO</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: TEMPO -> FEEDBACK: T(x) E(-) M(-) P(x) O(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE -> Feedback: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
Meaning:
- R is not in the word.
- A is not in the word.
- I is not in the word.
- S is not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in the last position (position 5).

Guess 2: TEMPO -> Feedback: T(x) E(-) M(-) P(x) O(-)
Meaning:
- T is not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in the second position (since we guessed E at position 2 and got '-'). But we already knew E is in the word and not at position 5. Now we know it's also not at position 2.
- M is in the word but not in position 3 (since we guessed M at position 3 and got '-').
- P is not in the word.
- O is in the word but not in position 5.

So summarizing what we know:

Definitely not in the word: R, A, I, S, T, P
Present in the word: E, M, O
But:
- E must be in the word (from both guesses) but not at positions 2 or 5. So E must be at position 1, 3, or 4.
- M must be in the word, but not at position 3 (from the second guess), and we haven't tested position 1, 2, 4, or 5 for M? Actually, we only tried M at position 3? So M could be at 1,2,4,5.
- O must be in the word, but not at position 5 (from the second guess). We haven't tested O at other positions? Actually, we only tried O at position 5? In TEMPO, O was at position 5. So O could be at position 1,2,3,4.

Additionally, from guess 1 E was at position 5? Actually, E was at position 5? Wait, no: RAISE positions: R(1), A(2), I(3), S(4), E(5). So E at position 5 got '-', meaning E is present but not at 5. In the second guess, E at position 2 got '-', meaning E present but not at 2? Therefore, E must be at position 1, 3, or 4.

Similarly, O at position 5 was not correct? So O could be at 1,2,3,4.

M at position 3 was not correct? So M could be at 1,2,4,5.

Now, we have three known letters: E, M, O. And we don't know the other two? Actually, no: we only have five positions? So there are two more letters? But we have eliminated several common letters.

Also, note: the word cannot contain any of the excluded letters: R, A, I, S, T, P.

List of letters we must avoid: R, A, I, S, T, P.

We have E, M, O as present. So the secret word has E, M, O, and two other letters that are not in the excluded list? Since E, M, O are confirmed.

We need to find a 5-letter English word that:
- Contains E, M, and O.
- Does not contain R, A, I, S, T, P.
- Places E not in positions 2 or 5? So E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.
- Places M not in position 3? Because feedback from TEMPO: M at position 3 was '-', meaning M is present but not at 3? So M must be in 1,2,4,5.
- Places O not in position 5? So O must be in 1,2,3,4.

Additionally, we have two more letters? Since it's 5 letters? So two more? But we don't know them? So we must choose a word that includes E, M, O and two other letters that are not excluded.

Common letters not excluded: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should try to guess a word that includes E, M, O and tries to place E in one of the possible positions? And similarly for M and O.

Possible placements:
- E at position 1? Then what? We need to fit M and O accordingly? Without conflicting with their constraints.

Alternatively, we can think of words containing E, M, O.

For example, common words: ""MOVED"", ""MINCE""? But I is excluded? MINCE has I? Not allowed? Must avoid I.

""MODEL""? Has D,E,L? But MODEL: M,O,D,E,L -> but E at position 4? And O at position 2? And M at position 1? That could be? But see if the positions satisfy:
- M at position 1? We haven't tested position 1? So no prior feedback? Good? But the feedback didn't say M not at 1? So it could be.
- O at position 2? We haven't tested O at 2? In previous guess, we tested O at 5? So O can be at 2? Yes.
- E at position 4? Not 5 or 2? Good? So positions: 1:M, 2:O, 3:D, 4:E, 5:L

But what about the M constraint? We know M not at position 3? Correct? But in MODEL, M is at 1? So okay? Similarly, E at 4? Not 2 or 5? Good? O at 2? Not 5? Good.

But we need to check the letters: M,O,D,E,L? Avoided R,A,I,S,T,P? Yes? D and L are allowed? Because we haven't eliminated them? Correct? D and L not in excluded list? So yes.

Also, MODEL is a valid English word.

But is that the only? What about ""MONEY""? M,O,N,E,Y -> has N,E,Y? But E at position 4? And M at 1? O at 2? Positions: M(1),O(2),N(3),E(4),Y(5)? So:
- E at position 4? Good? (not 2 or 5)
- M at 1? We haven't tested? But feedback said M not at position 3? And 1 is not 3? So okay? But we don't know if M is at 1? But for now? Okay? Similarly, O at 2? Not tested? Can be? So okay? And avoids R,A,I,S,T,P? M,O,N,E,Y? No excluded letters? Yes? So MONEY is another candidate.

But also, ""MOLES""? M,O,L,E,S? But S is excluded? Avoid S? So cannot? MODEL has L? But no S? Correct? MODEL has D and L? MONEY has N and Y? Both valid?

Another: ""HOMED""? H,O,M,E,D -> positions: H(1),O(2),M(3),E(4),D(5)? But M at position 3? But we got feedback from TEMPO that M at position 3 is '-'? No? Wait, feedback for M: M was at position 3? And we got '-' meaning M is present but not at position 3? So we CANNOT place M at position 3? Therefore, HOMED is invalid because it puts M at 3? Correct? So must avoid position 3 for M? Thus, M in positions 1,2,4,5? So in MODEL: M at 1? Okay? MONEY: M at 1? Okay? Another possibility: M at position 4? For example, ""COME ON""? Not 5? ""IMAGE""? Has I? Avoid? ""DUMPS""? P is excluded? Avoid? ""TIMER""? T and I? Avoid? So perhaps MODEL and MONEY are candidates? But I need to consider E position as well? Both have E at 4? Acceptable? Yes? Also, O position: O at 2? Good? Or O at other positions? But O not at 5? Both satisfy? Similarly, M at 1? Okay? But we can also have M at other positions? For instance, E at position 1? So words? ""EMBED""? E,M,B,E,D -> E at 1 and 4? But positions: E(1), M(2), B(3), E(4), D(5)? Let's check:
- E at 1? We have not tested E at position 1? So no conflict? But E at 1? And E is at 4? Could be? But we know E is present? But possibly two E's? But in previous, we only know one E? But it might have more? But feedback would show if it? We don't know? But EMBED: E at 1 and 4? But we are avoiding T,P? etc? E,M,B,E,D? Avoids R,A,I,S,T,P? Yes? And M at position 2? Not 3? Good? So EMBED is also possible? Similarly, E at position 3? Words like ""CAME O"" not? ""LEMON"" but L was not tested? But avoid? Wait, LEMON has L,E,M,O,N? But E at position 2? And we tried E at position 2? In guess 2? TEMPO had E at position 2? And it was '-'? So E cannot be at position 2? So we cannot put E at 2? Therefore, LEMON has E at 2? Not allowed? So skip.

Another E at 3: ""DEMON""? D,E,M,O,N? Positions: D(1),E(2),M(3),O(4),N(5)? But E at position 2? Which we tried? And we know E not at 2? So cannot? Similarly, ""GIVEN""? Has I? Avoid? ""LEVEL""? Has E, E? But E at position 1? Then at 3? Then E at 1? Positions: L,E,V,E,L? Not? Actually? L(1), E(2), V(3), E(4), L(5)? But E at 2? Forbidden? So skip.

So E must be at 1, 3, or 4? But not at 2? So position 3? E at position 3? Words? ""SCENE""? Has S,C? S excluded? Avoid? ""DEUCE""? Has E? But position 1 and 4? Or? D,E,U,C,E? Positions: D(1),E(2),U(3),C(4),E(5)? E at 2? Forbidden? And E at 5? Also forbidden? We know E not at 2 or 5? So DEUCE places E at 2 and 5? Not good? Skip.

Another? ""MEDAL""? M,E,D,A,L? But A excluded? Avoid? ""BEVEL""? B,E,V,E,L? E at 2 and 4? E at 2? Forbidden? Skip.

So E at position 3? Difficult to think? Let's list possibilities:

Option 1: E at position 1? Words: EMBER? But R? Avoid? EXCEL? E at 1 and 4? But we tried EXCEL? Not? We didn't? But in previous? Or? EXCEL: E,X,C,E,L? But X,C,L? Avoid R,A,I,S,T,P? E,X,C,E,L? No? So acceptable? But E at 1 and 4? And X? C? L? But we don't know if X? Actually? Positions: 
- EMBED: E at 1 and 4? Or EMBOSS? But O? But letters: E,M,B,O,S? S excluded? Avoid? EMBED: E(1),M(2),B(3),E(4),D(5)? This word: 
- E at position 1: and E at position 4? But note: we have M at position 2? And O not needed? But the word must contain O? Because from feedback, O must be present? From second guess feedback: O at position 5 was '-'? Meaning O is present? So O must be in the word? So EMBED does not have O? So invalid? Because O must be present? Similarly, MONEY has O? MODEL has O? We must include O? And M? And E? So all three must be in the word? Therefore, EMBED is invalid because it lacks O? Correct? Similarly, EXCEL: E,X,C,E,L? No O? And no M? Or? But the secret word has M? So EXCEL would not contain M? But feedback from TEMPO says M is in the word? So we must have M? Therefore, we must choose words that contain E, M, O? And two others? Not excluded letters? So EMBED cannot be used? Because no O? Therefore, option E at position 1? With E,M,O? Words like ""EMOTE""? E,M,O,T,E? T excluded? Avoid T? Cannot? ""MOGUL""? Not E? Must have E? So hard? Maybe not many words with E at beginning and M and O? And must avoid T? 

Therefore, E at position 3 or 4? Perhaps position 4 is easier? As we had MODEL: M,O,D,E,L -> E at 4? And M at 1? O at 2? MONEY: M,O,N,E,Y -> E at 4? Etc? All with E at 4? Also, position 3? E at position 3? Words: ""COMET""? But T excluded? Avoid T? ""DOME O"" not? ""HOMED""? But M at position 3? Forbidden? ""CUMIN""? Not E? Must have? And avoid U? But U allowed? But E must be at 3? Let's think: ""DINER"" has I? Avoid? ""OUNCE""? O,U,N,C,E? Positions: O(1),U(2),N(3),C(4),E(5)? E at 5? We know E not at 5? Skip? ""UNMET""? U,N,M,E,T? But T excluded? Avoid? ""FLUME""? F,L,U,M,E? E at 5? Skip? Not 5. ""METAL"" T? Avoid? Etc? So perhaps not? So E at position 4? With M and O? Words: as MODEL, MONEY.

Another: ""JUMPS""? But P? Avoid? ""GLOBE""? G,L,O,B,E? E at position 5? Not allowed? Skip? ""CHOSE""? No M? Must have M? ""MONTH""? T? Avoid? So MODEL and MONEY? Seems main candidates.

Now, we need to guess? But both satisfy? Also, MODEL: M,O,D,E,L? MONEY: M,O,N,E,Y? Both are valid words? Now, which is better? We need to test the letters D and L? Or N and Y? Since we haven't tested? Also, note that in MODEL, E is at position 4? Which we haven't tested? Similarly? In both? So feedback will tell us? Perhaps we choose MODEL because it has D which is common? Or MONEY? But N is common? So evenly? But note: there could be others? Like ""COMBO""? But C,O,M,B,O? O at position 2 and 5? But O not at 5? So cannot? Because O must not be at 5? So position 5? O at 5 would be wrong? But not necessarily? Feedback for O was '-' at position 5? Meaning O present? But not at that position? So COMBO would place O at 5? Which we know is wrong? So feedback would be minus? So better not? Or ""OWLET""? O,W,L,E,T? Avoid T? Cannot? So MODEL and MONEY? Another: ""MODEM""? But M at position 1 and 4? And E at 3? Position: M(1),O(2),D(3),E(4),M(5)? Now, E at 4? Acceptable? Similarly, O at 2? M at position 1? And also at position 5? But we know M at position 3? But no constraint? Actually, M at position 3 is forbidden? But here M is at 1 and 5? So okay? And avoids R,A,I,S,T,P? Yes? And E at 4? Good? And O at 2? Good? So MODEM is also valid? Similarly, we could have MODEL, MODEM, MONEY.

But MODEM has two M's? Possible? The secret word might have duplicate letters? For example? But we don't know? So both MODEL and MODEM? But MODEL: E at 4? MODEM: E at 4? Same? So MODEM: M,O,D,E,M? But position 5 is M? So O in position 2? We haven't tested O at 2? Similarly? So okay? But perhaps we should choose one? To test? Since O and M are flexible? 

Moreover, we also need to consider the constraints for O: O not at 5? Good? All leave O at 1,2,3,4? Similarly M not at 3? In MODEL M at 1? In MODEM M at 1 and 5? In MONEY M at 1? All avoid M at 3? So okay? 

So we can guess MODEL? Or MONEY? Let's choose MODEL? Because we can then test D and L? Whereas MONEY tests N and Y? Y might be less frequent? So MODEL? 

But wait, what about the E position? In MODEL, E is at position 4? Which we haven't tried? If it's not correct, we'll know? Similarly? 

Alternatively, we might guess a word that has E at position 3? But we haven't? Maybe not necessary? Because E can only be at 1,3,4? And we haven't ruled out position 1? But at position 1? With E,M,O? Hard to find? Words like ""EMBOW""? E,M,B,O,W? Positions: E(1),M(2),B(3),O(4),W(5)? So E at 1? M at 2? O at 4? All acceptable? Since we know E not at 2 and not at 5? M not at 3? O not at 5? And avoided R,A,I,S,T,P? So EMBOW? Is it a word? Embow means to furnish? But valid? Might not be common? But in Wordle, valid words? Or ELBOW? But we didn't choose it earlier? But ELBOW has E at position 1? And M? Does it? No, ELBOW: E,L,B,O,W? But missing M? Because secret word must have M? So ELBOW cannot be? Therefore, EMBOW? E,M,B,O,W? This includes E at 1? M at 2? O at 4? And letters? Avoid excluded? Yes? But we haven't tested E at 1? M at 2? etc? So EMBOW? Valid? But to be safe? Stick with common words? 

Given that MODEL is a common word? So I'll go with MODEL? 

So next guess? MODEL.

But let me confirm MODEL? 
M,O,D,E,L? 
Positions:
1: M? Not tested? Feedback? 
2: O? Not tested? 
3: D? New letter? Not tested? 
4: E? Testing E at position 4? Which we know E not at 2 or 5? So if E is at 4, it might be correct? Or if not, feedback tell? 
5: L? New letter? 

Also, it has O? And M? 

So feedback could help? 

Therefore, I choose MODEL? 

So <guess> MODEL </guess>### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Current Knowns from Feedback:**
   - **Excluded Letters:** R, A, I, S, T, P (not in the word at all).
   - **Letters in the Word:** E, M, O (confirmed present).
   - **Constraints on Positions:**
     - **E:** Cannot be at position 2 or 5 (from previous guesses). Must be at position 1, 3, or 4.
     - **M:** Cannot be at position 3 (from Guess 2 feedback). Can be at position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
     - **O:** Cannot be at position 5 (from Guess 2 feedback). Can be at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

2. **Word Requirements:**
   - Must include **E**, **M**, and **O**.
   - Must avoid excluded letters (R, A, I, S, T, P).
   - Two additional letters are unknown but must be from the remaining English alphabet (B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).
   - E must be in position 1, 3, or 4; M not in 3; O not in 5.

3. **Possible Words Considered:**
   - **MODEL:** Positions: M(1), O(2), D(3), E(4), L(5). Satisfies all constraints:
     - E at position 4 (not 2 or 5), M at 1 (not 3), O at 2 (not 5).
     - Letters D and L are untested and not excluded.
     - Valid 5-letter word meeting criteria.
   - **MONEY:** Positions: M(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), Y(5). Also valid but less common; Y may be rarer. Similar reasoning.
   - **MODEM:** Positions: M(1), O(2), D(3), E(4), M(5). Valid but less common due to double M.
   - **Other options rejected**:
     - EMBOW: E(1), M(2), B(3), O(4), W(5). Less common word; tests E at position 1.
     - MONEY/COMBO/others: MONEY valid but MODEL prioritized (similar test coverage with more common letters).

4. **Why MODEL?**
   - Tests E specifically at position 4, narrowing down possible locations.
   - Introduces new letters D and L, maximizing information.
   - Avoids all excluded letters and satisfies positional constraints.
   - Common English word, ideal for efficient guessing.

5. **Expectations:**
   - Feedback will confirm/refute positions for E, M, O and reveal D/L presence/positions.
   - If E is at position 4, it would show ✓; otherwise, feedback guides next attempt.

We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.\n A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.\n Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.\n\n Let\'s choose a word that has common letters: we want at least two vowels and some frequent consonants.\n The word ""ROAST"" is a good candidate because:\n   - It contains \'R\', \'O\', \'A\', \'S\', \'T\' — all common letters.\n   - It has two vowels (\'O\' and \'A\') and three consonants.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"". But let\'s go with ""ROAST"".\n\n However, note that the example in the rules used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", but we are free to choose.\n\n Another popular choice is ""RAISE"". It has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).\n\n But let\'s stick with a balanced word: ""ROAST"".\n\n However, to maximize the information, we might also consider ""CRATE"" or ""SLANT"". \n\n After some thought, I recall that ""RAISE"" is often recommended because it has three vowels and common consonants.\n\n Let me choose ""RAISE"" for the first guess.\n\n But note: the example secret word was ""BRISK"", and if we guess ""RAISE"", we would get:\n   R: present but in wrong position? (because in BRISK, R is at position 2, but in RAISE it\'s at position 1) -> so R would be marked as \'-\'\n   A: not in BRISK -> \'x\'\n   I: in BRISK at position 3, and in RAISE at position 3 -> so I would be marked as \'✓\'\n   S: in BRISK at position 4, and in RAISE at position 4? -> but in RAISE, S is at position 4, and in BRISK S is at position 4? Actually, BRISK is B-R-I-S-K, so S is at position 4. So S would be \'✓\'\n   E: not in BRISK -> \'x\'\n\n So the feedback would be: R(-), A(x), I(✓), S(✓), E(x)\n\n That gives two correct and one present. But we are just starting.\n\n However, for the first guess, we don\'t have any information. So any word is acceptable.\n\n I will go with ""RAISE"".\n\n But note: the problem says to return the guess in the specified format.\n\n Let me output: <guess> RAISE </guess>For the first guess, I chose ""RAISE"" because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which helps test frequently used letters. This increases the chances of getting useful feedback about the secret word\'s letters and their positions.\n\n<guess>RAISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from the first guess: RAISE -> R(x), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(-)\n\nInterpretation:\n- R, A, I, S are not in the secret word at all (marked by x).\n- E is in the word but in the wrong position (marked by -).\n\nSo we know:\n- The secret word contains the letter E, but not in the fifth position (since we guessed E at the end and it\'s wrong position).\n- The letters R, A, I, S are not in the word. So we must avoid these letters in our next guess.\n\nSince E is in the word but not at the end, let\'s think about possible positions for E. It could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nWe also know that the word does not contain R, A, I, S. Therefore, we must use other letters.\n\nNow, we need to choose a new word that:\n- Is 5 letters long and a valid English word.\n- Does not contain R, A, I, S.\n- Contains the letter E, but not at position 5 (since we already tried that and it was wrong). So E must be at positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nTo maximize information, we might want to try E in a different position and use other common letters that we haven\'t tried yet.\n\nWe have used: R, A, I, S, E. So avoid R, A, I, S, but we can use E (if we put it in a new position) and new letters.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tried: T, N, O, L, U, D, C, M, etc.\n\nGood strategy: try a word with E in a different position and test other vowels? But note: we have eliminated A and I, so the remaining vowels are O, U (and sometimes Y). But Y is less common.\n\nWe must have E in the word somewhere, but we don\'t know where. So we can try E at the beginning or in the middle.\n\nLet me list some words that have E but not in the fifth position and do not contain R, A, I, S.\n\nPossible positions for E:\n- Position 1: E _ _ _ _\n- Position 2: _ E _ _ _\n- Position 3: _ _ E _ _\n- Position 4: _ _ _ E _\n\nWe also want to use other common consonants.\n\nWord ideas:\n- Position 1: E ... e.g., ""ELBOW"", ""ENJOY"" -> but must be 5 letters and without R,A,I,S.\n  ELBOW: E, L, B, O, W -> no R,A,I,S? Check: E, L, B, O, W. Good.\n- Position 2: ... e.g., ""LEMON"", ""DEPOT"", ""TEMPO"" -> LEMON: L,E,M,O,N -> avoid? L,E,M,O,N: no R,A,I,S? Yes, but we don\'t know if these are in the word. We want to test new letters.\n- Position 3: ... e.g., ""HOTEL"" -> H,O,T,E,L -> has E at position 4? Wait, H-O-T-E-L, E is at position 4? Actually: H=1, O=2, T=3, E=4, L=5 -> but we must place E not in 5? So position 4 is okay? But in our previous guess E was in position 5 and was wrong position, but we don\'t know about position 4 yet. However, note that the feedback for E was a minus, meaning E is in the word but not in position 5. But it could be in position 4? Actually, position 4 or others. So we can try E in position 4? Yes.\n\nBut let\'s avoid confusion: the secret word contains E, so we must include E in every guess until we know its position? Actually we don\'t have to, but we should because we know it\'s present and we haven\'t located its position yet. So it\'s efficient to include E again in a different position.\n\nSo I think including E again is good.\n\nTry E in position 1: so words starting with E.\n\nPossible words: ECHOS, ECLAT, EDIFY, EGRET, EJECT, ELBOW, ELEGY, ELEMENT? Wait 5 letters: ELBOW, EPOXY, ETHER, EXCEL? But must avoid R,A,I,S.\n\nSo:\n- ELBOW: E, L, B, O, W -> all new letters? None of L,B,O,W have been tested? Correct? Yes. So this would test E at position 1 and L,B,O,W.\n\nSimilarly, other words: ENDOW, ENJOY? ENJOY: E,N,J,O,Y -> no R,A,I,S? J and Y might be less common.\n\nBut ELBOW seems like a good word: common and tests E in a new position.\n\nAlternatively, position 2: let\'s think of words with E in position 2: e.g., ""HELLO"" -> but H,E,L,L,O. We don\'t know H and O. But double L? We want to test more distinct letters if possible.\n\nPosition 3: words like ""YETI"" not 5 letters? ""BELLE"" -> double L? ""FREED"" -> has R, we cannot use R. Must avoid R. So words with E in position 3: e.g., ""CREPE"" has R? CREPE: C,R,E,P,E -> R is excluded. No. ""PLUME"": P,L,U,M,E -> E at position 5? But we cannot use E at position 5? Wait, we can use it because we are trying a different position? Actually, we can use it again at position 5? It\'s allowed because we haven\'t confirmed it\'s not there? Actually, we don\'t know: the feedback just said the E is present but not in position 5. So if we put E again at position 5, we know it will be a minus again? Because if the word has E not in 5, then E at 5 will still be wrong. So it\'s redundant? So to learn new positions, we might avoid E at position 5.\n\nSo we should put E at positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nPosition 4: words like ""THYME"": T,H,Y,M,E -> but E is at position 5? Wait, no: T=1, H=2, Y=3, M=4, E=5 -> that puts E at 5 again. So bad.\n\nAnother: ""BEADS""? No, has A? Avoid A.\n\nSo let\'s look for words with E at position 4: e.g., ""MAPLE"" has A. Avoid. ""TOWEL"": T,O,W,E,L -> E at position 4? T(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), L(5). So that\'s good: E not in 5? But we don\'t mind position 5 for L? We want E at 4 to test.\n\nAnother: ""CABLE"" -> C=1, A=2? Avoid A.\n\n""NOBLE"": N,O,B,L,E -> E is at position 5? N=1,O=2,B=3,L=4,E=5 -> again position 5. So bad.\n\nActually, position 4 would be the fourth letter, so we need a word where the fourth letter is E, but the fifth is not E and not a forbidden letter.\n\nExample: ""BELLE"" -> B,E,L,L,E? Positions: B=1, E=2? We want letter 4. Another: ""TWEEN""? T,W,E,E,N? E at position 3? Not 4.\n\nPerhaps: ""PRIDE""? Avoid R,I. ""BRIDE""? Avoid B? No R,A,I,S, but B is allowed? ""BRIDE"" has I? Avoid I.\n\nHard to find position 4. So maybe position 4 is not common? So stick with position 1 or 2.\n\nPosition 2: words like in position 2: ""CELLO"": C,E,L,L,O -> double L.\n\n""DENIM"": D,E,N,I,M -> has I? Avoid I.\n\nWords with E in position 2: ""VEIL"" not 5? ""BEIGE"": B,E,I,G,E -> I is excluded? Avoid I.\n\n""DEUCE"": D,E,U,C,E -> E at position 2 and 5? But we are avoiding position 5? But this has two E\'s? Permissible? Maybe? But we know there\'s an E? But we don\'t know if there are two? So DEUCE: D,E,U,C,E -> so E at position 5? We want to avoid position 5? But if the word only has one E and it\'s not at 5, then putting E at 5 again will be minus? But putting E at 2 might be correct or minus.\n\nBut to avoid redundancy? Better to put E at a position we haven\'t tried? We tried position 5, so try 2? So DEUCE? But DEUCE has E at 5? It\'s tricky.\n\nAlternatively: ""MEATY"" has A? Avoid A.\n\nSo let\'s go back to position 1: \n\nELBOW: E,L,B,O,W -> valid and common letters.\n\nOther words: EIGHT? Has G,H,T? But E,I,G,H,T? But we must avoid I? EIGHT has I? Avoid.\n\nECLAT? E,C,L,A,T -> has A? Avoid A.\n\nSo ELBOW seems good: E L B O W -> no A, R, I, S.\n\nAnother common word: ""EXCEL""? But E,X,C,E,L -> E at positions 1 and 4? And L at end. But E at 4? We haven\'t tried. But also has E at 1? Actually, EXCEL: E=1, X=2, C=3, E=4, L=5 -> E at 1 and 4? And L at 5. Since we know E is in the word, we can test E at two positions? But note that if the word has only one E, then one of these will be misplaced unless it hits exactly. But EXCEL contains A,R,I,S? Let\'s check: E, X, C, E, L? None of R,A,I,S. So acceptable? Yes.\n\nBut let me avoid double E? Because it might confuse? But possible. Actually, in ELBOW we have distinct letters? Yes.\n\nSo I think ELBOW is a safe bet to test E at the beginning and other common letters.\n\nBut we must remember that the word might have duplicate letters? But we haven\'t encountered any indication yet? So ELBOW is distinct letters.\n\nAnother word: ""ENVOY"": E,N,V,O,Y? Also good? Envoy: E,N,V,O,Y -> no R,A,I,S? Yes.\n\nBut ELBOW is more common? Both okay.\n\nI\'ll go with ELBOW.\n\nBut note: we also have not tried T, N, D, etc? So ELBOW introduces B, O, L, W.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word with T? T is very common.\n\nFor example, position 2: METRO? Avoid M,E,T,R,O? R is excluded? METRO has R? Avoid.\n\nPosition 1: TEMPO? T,E,M,P,O -> E at position 2? And O? T,E,M,P,O? And no R,A,I,S? Check: T,E,M,P,O -> no R,A,I,S? Yes.\n\nTEMPO: T=1, E=2, M=3, P=4, O=5? So E at position 2? That\'s good because we haven\'t tried position 2.\n\nAnd TEMPO has T and E? And common letters? M,P,O.\n\nCompared to ELBOW? ELBOW has E at 1? But TEMPO has E at 2.\n\nTEMPO might be better? Because we are testing E at position 2.\n\nBut we don\'t have much preference? Both are valid.\n\nBut TEMPO has T? Which is very common? So likely to get hits? But note: we know E is in? But T might be in or not? So TEMPO tests more letters: T,E,M,P,O.\n\nElbow: E,L,B,O,W? Less common letters? But okay.\n\nI think either is fine.\n\nLet\'s choose TEMPO? Because T and O are frequent.\n\nAnother: ""BEGIN"": has B,E,G,I,N -> I is excluded? Avoid I.\n\nSo TEMPO seems solid.\n\nBut TEMPO? Is it a valid word? Yes.\n\nSo I\'ll guess TEMPO.\n\nBut let me confirm the letters: T, E, M, P, O. None of R,A,I,S? Correct? R is not in T,E,M,P,O. A,I,S are not present.\n\nAnd we have E? Yes, in position 2? Not position 5? Correct? Position 2 is new.\n\nSo better than ELBOW? Because E at a different position? And TEMPO is equally common.\n\nBut ELBOW would test different letters? Let\'s decide.\n\nI\'ll go with TEMPO.\n\nSo next guess: TEMPO.\n\nIn summary: we are avoiding R,A,I,S and including E at position 2.\n\nResponse format: <guess> TEMPO </guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess RAISE, where R(x), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(-):\n- The letters R, A, I, and S are **not** in the secret word, so they must be avoided.\n- The letter E **is** in the secret word, but not in the fifth position.

So O could be at 1,2,3,4.\n\nM at position 3 was not correct? So M could be at 1,2,4,5.\n\nNow, we have three known letters: E, M, O. And we don\'t know the other two? Actually, no: we only have five positions? So there are two more letters? But we have eliminated several common letters.\n\nAlso, note: the word cannot contain any of the excluded letters: R, A, I, S, T, P.\n\nList of letters we must avoid: R, A, I, S, T, P.\n\nWe have E, M, O as present. So the secret word has E, M, O, and two other letters that are not in the excluded list? Since E, M, O are confirmed.\n\nWe need to find a 5-letter English word that:\n- Contains E, M, and O.\n- Does not contain R, A, I, S, T, P.\n- Places E not in positions 2 or 5? So E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.\n- Places M not in position 3? Because feedback from TEMPO: M at position 3 was \'-\', meaning M is present but not at 3? So M must be in 1,2,4,5.\n- Places O not in position 5? So O must be in 1,2,3,4.\n\nAdditionally, we have two more letters? Since it\'s 5 letters? So two more? But we don\'t know them? So we must choose a word that includes E, M, O and two other letters that are not excluded.\n\nCommon letters not excluded: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe should try to guess a word that includes E, M, O and tries to place E in one of the possible positions? And similarly for M and O.\n\nPossible placements:\n- E at position 1? Then what? We need to fit M and O accordingly? Without conflicting with their constraints.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of words containing E, M, O.\n\nFor example, common words: ""MOVED"", ""MINCE""? But I is excluded? MINCE has I? Not allowed? Must avoid I.\n\n""MODEL""? Has D,E,L? But MODEL: M,O,D,E,L -> but E at position 4? And O at position 2? And M at position 1? That could be? But see if the positions satisfy:\n- M at position 1? We haven\'t tested position 1? So no prior feedback? Good? But the feedback didn\'t say M not at 1? So it could be.\n- O at position 2? We haven\'t tested O at 2? In previous guess, we tested O at 5? So O can be at 2? Yes.\n- E at position 4? Not 5 or 2? Good? So positions: 1:M, 2:O, 3:D, 4:E, 5:L\n\nBut what about the M constraint? We know M not at position 3? Correct? But in MODEL, M is at 1? So okay? Similarly, E at 4? Not 2 or 5? Good? O at 2? Not 5? Good.\n\nBut we need to check the letters: M,O,D,E,L? Avoided R,A,I,S,T,P? Yes? D and L are allowed? Because we haven\'t eliminated them? Correct? D and L not in excluded list? So yes.\n\nAlso, MODEL is a valid English word.\n\nBut is that the only? What about ""MONEY""? M,O,N,E,Y -> has N,E,Y? But E at position 4? And M at 1? O at 2? Positions: M(1),O(2),N(3),E(4),Y(5)? So:\n- E at position 4? Good? (not 2 or 5)\n- M at 1? We haven\'t tested? But feedback said M not at position 3? And 1 is not 3? So okay? But we don\'t know if M is at 1? But for now? Okay? Similarly, O at 2? Not tested? Can be? So okay? And avoids R,A,I,S,T,P? M,O,N,E,Y? No excluded letters? Yes? So MONEY is another candidate.\n\nBut also, ""MOLES""? M,O,L,E,S? But S is excluded? Avoid S? So cannot? MODEL has L? But no S? Correct? MODEL has D and L? MONEY has N and Y? Both valid?\n\nAnother: ""HOMED""? H,O,M,E,D -> positions: H(1),O(2),M(3),E(4),D(5)? But M at position 3? But we got feedback from TEMPO that M at position 3 is \'-\'? No? Wait, feedback for M: M was at position 3? And we got \'-\' meaning M is present but not at position 3? So we CANNOT place M at position 3? Therefore, HOMED is invalid because it puts M at 3? Correct? So must avoid position 3 for M? Thus, M in positions 1,2,4,5? So in MODEL: M at 1? Okay? MONEY: M at 1? Okay? Another possibility: M at position 4? For example, ""COME ON""? Not 5? ""IMAGE""? Has I? Avoid? ""DUMPS""? P is excluded? Avoid? ""TIMER""? T and I? Avoid? So perhaps MODEL and MONEY are candidates? But I need to consider E position as well? Both have E at 4? Acceptable? Yes? Also, O position: O at 2? Good? Or O at other positions? But O not at 5? Both satisfy? Similarly, M at 1? Okay? But we can also have M at other positions? For instance, E at position 1? So words? ""EMBED""? E,M,B,E,D -> E at 1 and 4? But positions: E(1), M(2), B(3), E(4), D(5)? Let\'s check:\n- E at 1? We have not tested E at position 1? So no conflict? But E at 1? And E is at 4? Could be? But we know E is present? But possibly two E\'s? But in previous, we only know one E? But it might have more? But feedback would show if it? We don\'t know? But EMBED: E at 1 and 4? But we are avoiding T,P? etc? E,M,B,E,D? Avoids R,A,I,S,T,P? Yes? And M at position 2? Not 3? Good? So EMBED is also possible? Similarly, E at position 3? Words like ""CAME O"" not? ""LEMON"" but L was not tested? But avoid? Wait, LEMON has L,E,M,O,N? But E at position 2? And we tried E at position 2? In guess 2? TEMPO had E at position 2? And it was \'-\'? So E cannot be at position 2? So we cannot put E at 2? Therefore, LEMON has E at 2? Not allowed? So skip.\n\nAnother E at 3: ""DEMON""? D,E,M,O,N? Positions: D(1),E(2),M(3),O(4),N(5)? But E at position 2? Which we tried? And we know E not at 2? So cannot? Similarly, ""GIVEN""? Has I? Avoid? ""LEVEL""? Has E, E? But E at position 1? Then at 3? Then E at 1? Positions: L,E,V,E,L? Not? Actually? L(1), E(2), V(3), E(4), L(5)? But E at 2? Forbidden? So skip.\n\nSo E must be at 1, 3, or 4? But not at 2? So position 3? E at position 3? Words? ""SCENE""? Has S,C? S excluded? Avoid? ""DEUCE""? Has E? But position 1 and 4? Or? D,E,U,C,E? Positions: D(1),E(2),U(3),C(4),E(5)? E at 2? Forbidden? And E at 5? Also forbidden? We know E not at 2 or 5? So DEUCE places E at 2 and 5? Not good? Skip.\n\nAnother? ""MEDAL""? M,E,D,A,L? But A excluded? Avoid? ""BEVEL""? B,E,V,E,L? E at 2 and 4? E at 2? Forbidden? Skip.\n\nSo E at position 3? Difficult to think? Let\'s list possibilities:\n\nOption 1: E at position 1? Words: EMBER? But R? Avoid? EXCEL? E at 1 and 4? But we tried EXCEL? Not? We didn\'t? But in previous? Or? EXCEL: E,X,C,E,L? But X,C,L? Avoid R,A,I,S,T,P? E,X,C,E,L? No? So acceptable? But E at 1 and 4? And X? C? L? But we don\'t know if X? Actually? Positions: \n- EMBED: E at 1 and 4? Or EMBOSS? But O? But letters: E,M,B,O,S? S excluded? Avoid? EMBED: E(1),M(2),B(3),E(4),D(5)? This word: \n- E at position 1: and E at position 4? But note: we have M at position 2? And O not needed? But the word must contain O? Because from feedback, O must be present? From second guess feedback: O at position 5 was \'-\'? Meaning O is present? So O must be in the word? So EMBED does not have O? So invalid? Because O must be present? Similarly, MONEY has O? MODEL has O? We must include O? And M? And E? So all three must be in the word? Therefore, EMBED is invalid because it lacks O? Correct? Similarly, EXCEL: E,X,C,E,L? No O? And no M? Or? But the secret word has M? So EXCEL would not contain M? But feedback from TEMPO says M is in the word? So we must have M? Therefore, we must choose words that contain E, M, O? And two others? Not excluded letters? So EMBED cannot be used? Because no O? Therefore, option E at position 1? With E,M,O? Words like ""EMOTE""? E,M,O,T,E? T excluded? Avoid T? Cannot? ""MOGUL""? Not E? Must have E? So hard? Maybe not many words with E at beginning and M and O? And must avoid T? \n\nTherefore, E at position 3 or 4? Perhaps position 4 is easier? As we had MODEL: M,O,D,E,L -> E at 4? And M at 1? O at 2? MONEY: M,O,N,E,Y -> E at 4? Etc? All with E at 4? Also, position 3? E at position 3? Words: ""COMET""? But T excluded? Avoid T? ""DOME O"" not? ""HOMED""? But M at position 3? Forbidden? ""CUMIN""? Not E? Must have? And avoid U? But U allowed? But E must be at 3? Let\'s think: ""DINER"" has I? Avoid? ""OUNCE""? O,U,N,C,E? Positions: O(1),U(2),N(3),C(4),E(5)? E at 5? We know E not at 5? Skip? ""UNMET""? U,N,M,E,T? But T excluded? Avoid? ""FLUME""? F,L,U,M,E? E at 5? Skip? Not 5. ""METAL"" T? Avoid? Etc? So perhaps not? So E at position 4? With M and O? Words: as MODEL, MONEY.\n\nAnother: ""JUMPS""? But P? Avoid? ""GLOBE""? G,L,O,B,E? E at position 5? Not allowed? Skip? ""CHOSE""? No M? Must have M? ""MONTH""? T? Avoid? So MODEL and MONEY? Seems main candidates.\n\nNow, we need to guess? But both satisfy? Also, MODEL: M,O,D,E,L? MONEY: M,O,N,E,Y? Both are valid words? Now, which is better? We need to test the letters D and L? Or N and Y? Since we haven\'t tested? Also, note that in MODEL, E is at position 4? Which we haven\'t tested? Similarly? In both? So feedback will tell us? Perhaps we choose MODEL because it has D which is common? Or MONEY? But N is common? So evenly? But note: there could be others? Like ""COMBO""? But C,O,M,B,O? O at position 2 and 5? But O not at 5? So cannot? Because O must not be at 5? So position 5? O at 5 would be wrong? But not necessarily? Feedback for O was \'-\' at position 5? Meaning O present? But not at that position? So COMBO would place O at 5? Which we know is wrong? So feedback would be minus? So better not? Or ""OWLET""? O,W,L,E,T? Avoid T? Cannot? So MODEL and MONEY? Another: ""MODEM""? But M at position 1 and 4? And E at 3? Position: M(1),O(2),D(3),E(4),M(5)? Now, E at 4? Acceptable? Similarly, O at 2? M at position 1? And also at position 5? But we know M at position 3? But no constraint? Actually, M at position 3 is forbidden? But here M is at 1 and 5? So okay? And avoids R,A,I,S,T,P? Yes? And E at 4? Good? And O at 2? Good? So MODEM is also valid? Similarly, we could have MODEL, MODEM, MONEY.\n\nBut MODEM has two M\'s? Possible? The secret word might have duplicate letters? For example? But we don\'t know? So both MODEL and MODEM? But MODEL: E at 4? MODEM: E at 4? Same? So MODEM: M,O,D,E,M? But position 5 is M? So O in position 2? We haven\'t tested O at 2? Similarly? So okay? But perhaps we should choose one? To test? Since O and M are flexible? \n\nMoreover, we also need to consider the constraints for O: O not at 5? Good? All leave O at 1,2,3,4? Similarly M not at 3? In MODEL M at 1? In MODEM M at 1 and 5? In MONEY M at 1? All avoid M at 3? So okay? \n\nSo we can guess MODEL? Or MONEY? Let\'s choose MODEL? Because we can then test D and L? Whereas MONEY tests N and Y? Y might be less frequent? So MODEL? \n\nBut wait, what about the E position? In MODEL, E is at position 4? Which we haven\'t tried? If it\'s not correct, we\'ll know? Similarly? \n\nAlternatively, we might guess a word that has E at position 3? But we haven\'t? Maybe not necessary? Because E can only be at 1,3,4? And we haven\'t ruled out position 1? But at position 1? With E,M,O? Hard to find? Words like ""EMBOW""? E,M,B,O,W? Positions: E(1),M(2),B(3),O(4),W(5)? So E at 1? M at 2? O at 4? All acceptable? Since we know E not at 2 and not at 5? M not at 3? O not at 5? And avoided R,A,I,S,T,P? So EMBOW? Is it a word? Embow means to furnish? But valid? Might not be common? But in Wordle, valid words? Or ELBOW? But we didn\'t choose it earlier? But ELBOW has E at position 1? And M? Does it? No, ELBOW: E,L,B,O,W? But missing M? Because secret word must have M? So ELBOW cannot be? Therefore, EMBOW? E,M,B,O,W? This includes E at 1? M at 2? O at 4? And letters? Avoid excluded? Yes? But we haven\'t tested E at 1? M at 2? etc? So EMBOW? Valid? But to be safe? Stick with common words? \n\nGiven that MODEL is a common word? So I\'ll go with MODEL? \n\nSo next guess? MODEL.\n\nBut let me confirm MODEL? \nM,O,D,E,L? \nPositions:\n1: M? Not tested? Feedback? \n2: O? Not tested? \n3: D? New letter? Not tested? \n4: E? Testing E at position 4? Which we know E not at 2 or 5? So if E is at 4, it might be correct? Or if not, feedback tell? \n5: L? New letter? \n\nAlso, it has O? And M? \n\nSo feedback could help? \n\nTherefore, I choose MODEL? \n\nSo <guess> MODEL </guess>### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Current Knowns from Feedback:**\n   - **Excluded Letters:** R, A, I, S, T, P (not in the word at all).\n   - **Letters in the Word:** E, M, O (confirmed present).\n   - **Constraints on Positions:**\n     - **E:** Cannot be at position 2 or 5 (from previous guesses). Must be at position 1, 3, or 4.\n     - **M:** Cannot be at position 3 (from Guess 2 feedback). Can be at position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n     - **O:** Cannot be at position 5 (from Guess 2 feedback). Can be at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n2. **Word Requirements:**\n   - Must include **E**, **M**, and **O**.\n   - Must avoid excluded letters (R, A, I, S, T, P).\n   - Two additional letters are unknown but must be from the remaining English alphabet (B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).\n   - E must be in position 1, 3, or 4; M not in 3; O not in 5.\n\n3. **Possible Words Considered:**\n   - **MODEL:** Positions: M(1), O(2), D(3), E(4), L(5). Satisfies all constraints:\n     - E at position 4 (not 2 or 5), M at 1 (not 3), O at 2 (not 5).\n     - Letters D and L are untested and not excluded.\n     - Valid 5-letter word meeting criteria.\n   - **MONEY:** Positions: M(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), Y(5). Also valid but less common; Y may be rarer. Similar reasoning.\n   - **MODEM:** Positions: M(1), O(2), D(3), E(4), M(5). Valid but less common due to double M.\n   - **Other options rejected**:\n     - EMBOW: E(1), M(2), B(3), O(4), W(5). Less common word; tests E at position 1.\n     - MONEY/COMBO/others: MONEY valid but MODEL prioritized (similar test coverage with more common letters).\n\n4. **Why MODEL?**\n   - Tests E specifically at position 4, narrowing down possible locations.\n   - Introduces new letters D and L, maximizing information.\n   - Avoids all excluded letters and satisfies positional constraints.\n   - Common English word, ideal for efficient guessing.\n\n5. **Expectations:**\n   - Feedback will confirm/refute positions for E, M, O and reveal D/L presence/positions.\n   - If E is at position 4, it would show ✓; otherwise, feedback guides next attempt.\n\n<guess>MODEL</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: TEMPO -> FEEDBACK: T(x) E(-) M(-) P(x) O(-)\nGuess 3: MODEL -> FEEDBACK: M(-) O(✓) D(x) E(✓) L(-)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE -> R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
Meaning: R, A, I, S are not in the word. E is in the word but not at position 5.

Guess 2: TEMPO -> T(x) E(-) M(-) P(x) O(-)
Meaning: T and P are not in the word. E is in the word but not at position 2. M is in the word but not at position 3. O is in the word but not at position 5.

Guess 3: MODEL -> M(-) O(✓) D(x) E(✓) L(-)
Meaning: 
- M is in the word but not at position 1 (since we guessed M at position 1 and got '-'). 
- O is in the word and at position 2 (correct position, so O is fixed at position 2).
- D is not in the word (x).
- E is in the word and at position 4 (correct position, so E is fixed at position 4).
- L is in the word but not at position 5 (since we guessed L at position 5 and got '-').

So now we know:
- The secret word has O at position 2 and E at position 4.
- The word also contains M and L, but we don't know their positions yet. However, we have constraints:
  - M cannot be at position 1 (from MODEL) or position 3 (from TEMPO). So M must be at position 2 or 5? But position 2 is taken by O? So M cannot be at 2? Therefore, M must be at position 5? Because positions 1, 2, 3 are ruled out? Let's see:
    - Position 1: ruled out by MODEL (M at 1 was '-')
    - Position 3: ruled out by TEMPO (M at 3 was '-')
    - Position 2: is occupied by O? So M cannot be at 2? Therefore, the only position left for M is position 5? But we have 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. Position 4 is E? So M must be at position 5? But wait, position 5 is the last? And in MODEL, we put L at 5 and got '-', meaning L is present but not at 5? So L cannot be at 5? Then M must be at 5? But we have to check.

Positions:
1: ? (cannot be M, because MODEL had M at 1 and got '-')
2: O (fixed)
3: ? 
4: E (fixed)
5: ? 

Now, M must be in the word? But where? It cannot be at 1 (from MODEL), cannot be at 3 (from TEMPO). Position 2 is O, so not available. Position 4 is E, not available. So only position 5? But then what about L? L is also in the word? And L cannot be at 5? Because in MODEL, L at 5 got '-'. So if M is at 5, then L must be at position 1 or 3? But position 1 is available? And position 3 is available? So that works? 

But wait, we have two letters left: M and L? But we have two positions: 1 and 3? But M cannot be at 1? And M cannot be at 3? So M cannot be at 1 or 3? But we have to place M? The only position left is 5? So M must be at 5? Then L must be at either 1 or 3? But L cannot be at 5? Which is good? Because we are putting L at 1 or 3? 

But M at 5: is that allowed? We haven't tested M at 5? So yes? 

So the word must be: 
Position 1: either L or the other letter? But we have only two letters: M and L? And we have positions 1, 3, 5? But position 5 must be M? Then positions 1 and 3 must be filled by L and one other letter? But we have only L? And one more? Because the word has 5 letters? We have O at 2, E at 4, and then M and L? But that's only 4? We need one more letter? 

I think I missed: the word has 5 letters. We know O, E, M, L are in the word? But that's 4? So there must be a fifth letter? 

From the feedback, we know the word contains: E, M, O, L? And one more? Because we have only identified 4 letters? 

In the feedback, we have:
- From RAISE: E is present? But we have E at 4? 
- From TEMPO: M and O present? 
- From MODEL: O and E are fixed? And M and L are present? 

So the word has at least: O, E, M, L? And one more? Because 5 letters? 

But in MODEL, we guessed M, O, D, E, L? And we got: M(-), O(✓), D(x), E(✓), L(-)? So the word has M, O, E, L? And D is not in? So the fifth letter is missing? 

Therefore, the secret word has 5 distinct letters? Or possibly duplicates? But we don't have any duplicate feedback? So probably 5 distinct? 

So the word has: 
- Position 2: O
- Position 4: E
- The letters M and L are present? But not at the positions we guessed? 
- And one more letter? 

But we have positions 1, 3, 5 to fill? With three letters: one of which is M, one is L, and one is unknown? 

But M cannot be at 1 or 3? So M must be at 5? Then positions 1 and 3 must be filled by L and the unknown letter? 

But L cannot be at 5? Which is good? Because we are putting L at 1 or 3? 

So the word structure: 
1: ? (could be L or the new letter)
2: O
3: ? (could be L or the new letter)
4: E
5: M (since M must be at 5? Because it cannot be at 1,2,3? And 4 is taken? So 5 is the only option? But we haven't tested? But logically? 

But wait, position 2 is O? So M cannot be at 2? And position 4 is E? So M cannot be at 4? So M must be at 5? 

Therefore, position 5 must be M? 

Then, we have positions 1 and 3? We have to place L and one new letter? 

But L cannot be at 5? Which is good? But we don't know about position 1 or 3? 

Also, we have an unknown letter? Let's call it X? 

So the word is: [letter1] O [letter3] E M

And the letters are: O, E, M, L, and X? 

Now, from the feedback, we know that D is not in the word? And we have excluded: R, A, I, S, T, P, D? 

So X must be a letter not in the excluded list? 

Excluded so far: R, A, I, S, T, P, D? 

And we have used: M, O, D, E, L? But D is excluded? 

So available letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? 

Now, we need to find a word of the form: _ O _ E M? 

And the word must contain L? 

So L must be at position 1 or 3? 

So two cases:
Case 1: L at position 1? Then word: L O ? E M? 
Case 2: L at position 3? Then word: ? O L E M? 

Now, we need to fill the remaining position with a letter from the available set? 

Also, the word must be a valid English word? 

Let's list possible words:

Case 1: L at 1? Then: L O ? E M? 
What words? For example, ""LOVEM""? Not a word? ""LOGEM""? No? ""LOCEM""? No? ""LOVEM"" is not a word? 

Common words? ""LOVEM"" is not? ""LOXEM""? No? 

Perhaps ""LOOEM""? Not? 

I think ""LOVEM"" is not a word? 

Case 2: L at 3? Then: ? O L E M? 
Words: ""WOLEM""? Not? ""COLEM""? Not? ""GOLEM""? Yes! GOLEM is a word? 

GOLEM: G O L E M? 

Check: 
- G at 1? 
- O at 2? 
- L at 3? 
- E at 4? 
- M at 5? 

Now, check the constraints:
- O at 2: correct? 
- E at 4: correct? 
- M at 5: we haven't tested? But we think it must be? 
- L at 3: we haven't tested? But in MODEL, L was at 5 and got '-', meaning L is present but not at 5? So L at 3 is possible? 
- G is a new letter? 

Also, check excluded letters: G is not in R,A,I,S,T,P,D? So okay? 

Moreover, the word contains M? At position 5? And we know M must be at 5? 

So GOLEM seems to fit? 

But are there other possibilities? 

What about if L is at 1? Then we need a word: L O ? E M? 

Possible? ""LOVEM"" is not a word? ""LOBEM""? Not? ""LOCEM""? Not? 

""LOZEM""? Not? 

I think GOLEM is the only common word? 

Another possibility: ""HOLME""? But H O L M E? Then positions: H(1), O(2), L(3), M(4), E(5)? But E at 5? We know E cannot be at 5? Because from RAISE, E at 5 was '-'. So E must be at 4? So HOLME has E at 5? Not allowed? 

""FOLEM""? Not a word? 

So GOLEM seems the only option? 

Therefore, we guess GOLEM? 

But let me confirm the feedback we would get? 

If the secret word is GOLEM? 

But we are to guess? 

Alternatively, we might consider if there are other words? 

What about ""VOLES""? But S excluded? Avoid? 

""COLES""? S excluded? 

""DOLEM""? D excluded? 

So GOLEM is the only one? 

Another: ""MOLES""? But S excluded? And M at 1? But we have M at 5? 

No? 

So I think GOLEM is the word? 

Therefore, we guess GOLEM? 

But note: in GOLEM, M is at position 5? And we haven't tested M at 5? But we deduced it must be? 

Also, L is at position 3? Which we haven't tested? 

So we can guess GOLEM? 

But to be safe? We might guess a word that tests the positions? But we are confident? 

So <guess> GOLEM </guess> 

But let me write the response? 

Alternatively, we might think of another word? But I think GOLEM is the only common word? 

Yes? 

So I'll go with that.

### Analysis of Feedback and Deductions:

1. **Feedback Summary:**
   - **Guess 1 (RAISE):** R, A, I, S are absent (x); E is present but not at position 5 (-).
   - **Guess 2 (TEMPO):** T, P are absent (x); E is present but not at position 2 (-); M is present but not at position 3 (-); O is present but not at position 5 (-).
   - **Guess 3 (MODEL):** M is present but not at position 1 (-); O is correct at position 2 (✓); D is absent (x); E is correct at position 4 (✓); L is present but not at position 5 (-).

2. **Key Deductions:**
   - **Fixed Positions:**
     - **Position 2:** Must be **O** (✓ from MODEL).
     - **Position 4:** Must be **E** (✓ from MODEL).
   - **Confirmed Present Letters:** E, M, O, L (all marked present in feedback).
   - **Excluded Letters:** R, A, I, S, T, P, D (all marked absent).
   - **Position Constraints:**
     - **M:** Cannot be at position 1 (MODEL feedback) or 3 (TEMPO feedback). Since positions 2 (O) and 4 (E) are fixed, **M must be at position 5** (only remaining option).
     - **L:** Cannot be at position 5 (MODEL feedback). Must be at position 1 or 3.
     - **Fifth Letter:** The word has 5 letters, with positions 1 and 3 still open. One must be L, and the other must be a new letter (not excluded).
   - **Word Structure:** `[Position 1: L or new letter]` + `O` (pos 2) + `[Position 3: L or new letter]` + `E` (pos 4) + `M` (pos 5).
   - **Available Letters (not excluded):** B, C, F, G, H, J, K, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

3. **Word Selection:**
   - **Testing L Positions:** We need a word matching `_ O _ E M` that includes L at position 1 or 3.
     - **Option 1 (L at position 1):** `L O _ E M` → No common English words (e.g., ""LOVEM"" invalid).
     - **Option 2 (L at position 3):** `_ O L E M` → **GOLEM** (valid word: G O L E M).
   - **Why GOLEM?**
     - Fits all constraints: O at 2, L at 3, E at 4, M at 5.
     - Uses G (untested, high-potential letter).
     - Confirms L at position 3 and M at position 5.
     - Eliminates other possibilities (e.g., no other valid words like ""COLEM"" or ""WOLEM"").

4. **Expected Feedback:**
   - If correct, all positions will match (✓).
   - If incorrect, feedback will refine L/M positions or reveal the fifth letter.

<guess>GOLEM</guess>",GOLEM,"We are given feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE -> R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
Meaning: R, A, I, S are not in the word. E is in the word but not at position 5.

Guess 2: TEMPO -> T(x) E(-) M(-) P(x) O(-)
Meaning: T and P are not in the word. E is in the word but not at position 2. M is in the word but not at position 3. O is in the word but not at position 5.

Guess 3: MODEL -> M(-) O(✓) D(x) E(✓) L(-)
Meaning: 
- M is in the word but not at position 1 (since we guessed M at position 1 and got '-'). 
- O is in the word and at position 2 (correct position, so O is fixed at position 2).
- D is not in the word (x).
- E is in the word and at position 4 (correct position, so E is fixed at position 4).
- L is in the word but not at position 5 (since we guessed L at position 5 and got '-').

So now we know:
- The secret word has O at position 2 and E at position 4.
- The word also contains M and L, but we don't know their positions yet. However, we have constraints:
  - M cannot be at position 1 (from MODEL) or position 3 (from TEMPO). So M must be at position 2 or 5? But position 2 is taken by O? So M cannot be at 2? Therefore, M must be at position 5? Because positions 1, 2, 3 are ruled out? Let's see:
    - Position 1: ruled out by MODEL (M at 1 was '-')
    - Position 3: ruled out by TEMPO (M at 3 was '-')
    - Position 2: is occupied by O? So M cannot be at 2? Therefore, the only position left for M is position 5? But we have 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. Position 4 is E? So M must be at position 5? But wait, position 5 is the last? And in MODEL, we put L at 5 and got '-', meaning L is present but not at 5? So L cannot be at 5? Then M must be at 5? But we have to check.

Positions:
1: ? (cannot be M, because MODEL had M at 1 and got '-')
2: O (fixed)
3: ? 
4: E (fixed)
5: ? 

Now, M must be in the word? But where? It cannot be at 1 (from MODEL), cannot be at 3 (from TEMPO). Position 2 is O, so not available. Position 4 is E, not available. So only position 5? But then what about L? L is also in the word? And L cannot be at 5? Because in MODEL, L at 5 got '-'. So if M is at 5, then L must be at position 1 or 3? But position 1 is available? And position 3 is available? So that works? 

But wait, we have two letters left: M and L? But we have two positions: 1 and 3? But M cannot be at 1? And M cannot be at 3? So M cannot be at 1 or 3? But we have to place M? The only position left is 5? So M must be at 5? Then L must be at either 1 or 3? But L cannot be at 5? Which is good? Because we are putting L at 1 or 3? 

But M at 5: is that allowed? We haven't tested M at 5? So yes? 

So the word must be: 
Position 1: either L or the other letter? But we have only two letters: M and L? And we have positions 1, 3, 5? But position 5 must be M? Then positions 1 and 3 must be filled by L and one other letter? But we have only L? And one more? Because the word has 5 letters? We have O at 2, E at 4, and then M and L? But that's only 4? We need one more letter? 

I think I missed: the word has 5 letters. We know O, E, M, L are in the word? But that's 4? So there must be a fifth letter? 

From the feedback, we know the word contains: E, M, O, L? And one more? Because we have only identified 4 letters? 

In the feedback, we have:
- From RAISE: E is present? But we have E at 4? 
- From TEMPO: M and O present? 
- From MODEL: O and E are fixed? And M and L are present? 

So the word has at least: O, E, M, L? And one more? Because 5 letters? 

But in MODEL, we guessed M, O, D, E, L? And we got: M(-), O(✓), D(x), E(✓), L(-)? So the word has M, O, E, L? And D is not in? So the fifth letter is missing? 

Therefore, the secret word has 5 distinct letters? Or possibly duplicates? But we don't have any duplicate feedback? So probably 5 distinct? 

So the word has: 
- Position 2: O
- Position 4: E
- The letters M and L are present? But not at the positions we guessed? 
- And one more letter? 

But we have positions 1, 3, 5 to fill? With three letters: one of which is M, one is L, and one is unknown? 

But M cannot be at 1 or 3? So M must be at 5? Then positions 1 and 3 must be filled by L and the unknown letter? 

But L cannot be at 5? Which is good? Because we are putting L at 1 or 3? 

So the word structure: 
1: ? (could be L or the new letter)
2: O
3: ? (could be L or the new letter)
4: E
5: M (since M must be at 5? Because it cannot be at 1,2,3? And 4 is taken? So 5 is the only option? But we haven't tested? But logically? 

But wait, position 2 is O? So M cannot be at 2? And position 4 is E? So M cannot be at 4? So M must be at 5? 

Therefore, position 5 must be M? 

Then, we have positions 1 and 3? We have to place L and one new letter? 

But L cannot be at 5? Which is good? But we don't know about position 1 or 3? 

Also, we have an unknown letter? Let's call it X? 

So the word is: [letter1] O [letter3] E M

And the letters are: O, E, M, L, and X? 

Now, from the feedback, we know that D is not in the word? And we have excluded: R, A, I, S, T, P, D? 

So X must be a letter not in the excluded list? 

Excluded so far: R, A, I, S, T, P, D? 

And we have used: M, O, D, E, L? But D is excluded? 

So available letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? 

Now, we need to find a word of the form: _ O _ E M? 

And the word must contain L? 

So L must be at position 1 or 3? 

So two cases:
Case 1: L at position 1? Then word: L O ? E M? 
Case 2: L at position 3? Then word: ? O L E M? 

Now, we need to fill the remaining position with a letter from the available set? 

Also, the word must be a valid English word? 

Let's list possible words:

Case 1: L at 1? Then: L O ? E M? 
What words? For example, ""LOVEM""? Not a word? ""LOGEM""? No? ""LOCEM""? No? ""LOVEM"" is not a word? 

Common words? ""LOVEM"" is not? ""LOXEM""? No? 

Perhaps ""LOOEM""? Not? 

I think ""LOVEM"" is not a word? 

Case 2: L at 3? Then: ? O L E M? 
Words: ""WOLEM""? Not? ""COLEM""? Not? ""GOLEM""? Yes! GOLEM is a word? 

GOLEM: G O L E M? 

Check: 
- G at 1? 
- O at 2? 
- L at 3? 
- E at 4? 
- M at 5? 

Now, check the constraints:
- O at 2: correct? 
- E at 4: correct? 
- M at 5: we haven't tested? But we think it must be? 
- L at 3: we haven't tested? But in MODEL, L was at 5 and got '-', meaning L is present but not at 5? So L at 3 is possible? 
- G is a new letter? 

Also, check excluded letters: G is not in R,A,I,S,T,P,D? So okay? 

Moreover, the word contains M? At position 5? And we know M must be at 5? 

So GOLEM seems to fit? 

But are there other possibilities? 

What about if L is at 1? Then we need a word: L O ? E M? 

Possible? ""LOVEM"" is not a word? ""LOBEM""? Not? ""LOCEM""? Not? 

""LOZEM""? Not? 

I think GOLEM is the only common word? 

Another possibility: ""HOLME""? But H O L M E? Then positions: H(1), O(2), L(3), M(4), E(5)? But E at 5? We know E cannot be at 5? Because from RAISE, E at 5 was '-'. So E must be at 4? So HOLME has E at 5? Not allowed? 

""FOLEM""? Not a word? 

So GOLEM seems the only option? 

Therefore, we guess GOLEM? 

But let me confirm the feedback we would get? 

If the secret word is GOLEM? 

But we are to guess? 

Alternatively, we might consider if there are other words? 

What about ""VOLES""? But S excluded? Avoid? 

""COLES""? S excluded? 

""DOLEM""? D excluded? 

So GOLEM is the only one? 

Another: ""MOLES""? But S excluded? And M at 1? But we have M at 5? 

No? 

So I think GOLEM is the word? 

Therefore, we guess GOLEM? 

But note: in GOLEM, M is at position 5? And we haven't tested M at 5? But we deduced it must be? 

Also, L is at position 3? Which we haven't tested? 

So we can guess GOLEM? 

But to be safe? We might guess a word that tests the positions? But we are confident? 

So <guess> GOLEM </guess> 

But let me write the response? 

Alternatively, we might think of another word? But I think GOLEM is the only common word? 

Yes?
