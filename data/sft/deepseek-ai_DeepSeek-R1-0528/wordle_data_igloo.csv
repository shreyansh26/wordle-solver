We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"" which was all incorrect: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x). This means that none of these letters are in the secret word at all.
 Since none of the letters in ""crane"" appear in the secret word, we need to choose a new word that avoids all these letters.

 Letters to avoid: C, R, A, N, E.

 We should pick a word that uses other common vowels and consonants.

 Common vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out)
 Common consonants: We have many, such as S, T, L, P, M, B, D, G, H, K, etc.

 We want a word that has five new letters and is likely to give us more information.

 Considering words without C, R, A, N, E.

 A good candidate might be ""SPOIL"", but let's check for more common words.

 Another common starting word is ""SLOTH"", but note that O is a vowel.

 Alternatively, ""TOILS"" or ""TULIP"". However, we want to maximize coverage.

 Let's try to include I and O since they are common vowels.

 Possible words: 
   ""PIOUS"" - letters P, I, O, U, S
   ""FOULS"" - F, O, U, L, S
   ""STOMP"" - S, T, O, M, P

 But note: we also have U and sometimes Y (though less common). We don't know if the word has any vowels yet, so including multiple vowels is good.

 Considering the feedback, our next guess should avoid C,R,A,N,E entirely.

 I think ""SPOIL"" is a good choice: S, P, O, I, L. All these letters are common and distinct.

 Another option: ""BUILT"" has B, U, I, L, T.

 But let's pick one. We'll go with ""SPOIL"".

For optimal information gain:
- Choose a word with common letters not yet tested, like S, T, O, L, I, P, M, B, or D.

We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters (C,R,A,N,E) are absent (x). So the secret word has none of these letters.
2. ""spoil"" -> S(x), P(x), O(-), I(-), L(-)

Important: 
- O, I, L are in the word but in the WRONG position.
- S and P are absent.

Since O, I, L are present but misplaced, they must be in the secret word, but not in the positions they were guessed in ""spoil"". 

In ""spoil"":
- O is in position 3
- I is in position 4
- L is in position 5

So in the secret word:
- O cannot be at position 3
- I cannot be at position 4
- L cannot be at position 5

Additionally, we know from Guess 1 that the letters C,R,A,N,E are absent, and from Guess 2 that S and P are absent. So the set of absent letters now includes: C, R, A, N, E, S, P.

Available letters: All letters except C,R,A,N,E,S,P. Very important to avoid these.

We also know that O, I, L must appear somewhere in the word.

Since O, I, L are present, but we don't know their correct positions yet.

We need to make a new guess that:
1. Includes O, I, and L (since they are in the word) but in different positions than in ""spoil"".
   - Specifically, O not at position 3, I not at position 4, L not at position 5.
2. Does not contain any absent letters: C,R,A,N,E,S,P.
3. The other two letters should be new ones, from the remaining alphabet.

Let me list possible letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

But note: we have two open positions since O,I,L take three positions. So we need two more letters.

Also, the word must be a valid 5-letter English word.

We also have to consider that O, I, L can be anywhere else.

Idea: try to place O, I, L in positions where they are allowed and add two new letters.

Possible new positions for O: any of 1,2,4,5 (since not position 3)
Similarly, I: any of 1,2,3,5 (not 4)
L: any of 1,2,3,4 (not 5)

We can rearrange them arbitrarily as long as they are not in the forbidden positions.

But we have to form a valid word.

Also, we can use the fact that O and I are vowels, so probably the word has a vowel somewhere.

Let me try to think of words containing O, I, L and two other new letters.

Consider words ending with L? But remember, L cannot be at position 5, so perhaps L at 1,2,3, or 4.

Similarly, O cannot be at 3.

I am considering common words with O,I,L.

Possible words:
- Could it be ""OIL""? But that's only 3 letters, so we need a 5-letter word.

We need two more letters.

One idea: words like ""BUILD"", but that has U and I, and D. But note: U is not excluded. However, ""BUILD"" has B,U,I,L,D.

Check letters: B,U,I,L,D. None are in the excluded set? 
Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,S,P. So U and B and D are allowed.

But in ""BUILD"", I is at position 3 and L is at position 4? Let's spell:
- Position 1: B
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: L
- Position 5: D

But in our feedback for ""spoil"", I was at position 4 (which is incorrect), but that doesn't mean I cannot be at position 3? 
Wait: The feedback for I was at position 4 being wrong, but it could be at position 3? Yes, because that wasn't tested.

Similarly, L was at position 5 and was wrong, but could L be at position 4? Yes.

However, O is also in the word. In ""BUILD"", there is no O. So it would be missing O, but O must be in the word.

Therefore, any guess must include O, I, and L.

So ""BUILD"" doesn't have O, so it cannot work.

We need a word that contains O, I, L and two other non-excluded letters.

Let me list some possibilities:

- How about ""TOIL""? But that's 4 letters. Need 5 letters.
We can have ""TOILS"" but S is excluded (from feedback: S is absent). So no.

- ""BOILS"" - but S is absent and P? No, S is excluded.

S is excluded, so no words with S.

Similarly, no P.

What about ""MOUTH""? But that has M,O,U,T,H. It has O, but lacks I and L.

We need I and L too.

The word must have at least O,I,L.

That means it must contain those three, plus two more letters from the allowed set.

So let me focus: O, I, L plus two from: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Also, the positions must be such that O not at 3, I not at 4, L not at 5.

Therefore, let's try to construct:

Option: Place O at position 1? Then I and L elsewhere.

Words starting with O: what words start with O and have I and L?

For example: ""OILER"" - O,I,L,E? But E is excluded (from guess 1). E(x), so absent.

""OILED"" - E and D. Again E is excluded.

""OIL"" in different positions? 

How about ""OLDIE"": O, L, D, I, E. But E is excluded.

No E.

What about ""GUILT""? G, U, I, L, T. No O.

We need O.

Another idea: ""VOILA"" - V,O,I,L,A. But A is excluded (from guess 1: A(x)).

A is out.

""DOILY"" - D,O,I,L,Y. Letters: D,O,I,L,Y.

All these letters: D,O,I,L,Y are allowed? 
Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,S,P. So D,O,I,L,Y are all okay.

Now, positions in ""DOILY"":
- D at 1
- O at 2
- I at 3
- L at 4
- Y at 5

Now, check if the forbidden positions are avoided:
- O cannot be at position 3? In ""DOILY"", O is at 2, which is fine. (O not at 3: okay)
- I cannot be at position 4? In ""DOILY"", I is at 3, which is a different position. Fine.
- L cannot be at position 5? In ""DOILY"", L is at 4, not 5. Fine.

Also, we get two new letters: D and Y.

Valid English word? ""DOILY"" means a small ornamental mat, yes.

So let's consider ""DOILY"".

But note: In ""spoil"", O was at position 3 and marked wrong (-), meaning it is elsewhere. In ""DOILY"", O is at 2, which is different.

Similarly, I was at 4 in ""spoil"", now at 3 in ""DOILY"", which is different and allowed since the feedback only said position 4 was wrong for I.

L was at 5 in ""spoil"", now at 4 in ""DOILY"", different.

So this seems good.

Are there other possibilities?

Another word: ""MOULD"" - M,O,U,L,D. But lacks I? We need I too.

Must have I.

""KOJI"" is not 5 letters.

""LOGIN"" - but has L,O,G,I,N. But N is excluded (from guess 1: N(x)).

N is out.

""YOGIS"" - has Y,O,G,I,S, but S is excluded.

What about ""GHOUL""? G,H,O,U,L. But no I.

We need O,I,L all together.

""TOXIC"" - T,O,X,I,C. C is excluded.

""JOLLY"" - J,O,L,L,Y. But has double L? And no I? It has O,L,Y, but misses I.

I is mandatory.

""BILLY"" - B,I,L,L,Y. Double L? And O is missing? Have I and L, no O.

O is mandatory.

So ""DOILY"" seems a strong candidate.

Another possibility: ""BIOIL""? Not a word.

""LOUIE"" - L,O,U,I,E, but E is excluded.

""WIELD"" - W,I,E,L,D, E excluded and no O.

So it's challenging.

Perhaps ""DITTO"" - D,I,T,T,O. But it has duplicate T? And no L? L is mandatory.

We require L.

Another idea: ""IGLOO"" - I,G,L,O,O. Has O twice? Positions:
1. I
2. G
3. L
4. O
5. O

But check positions:
- O: In ""spoil"", O was at position 3. Now we have O at positions 4 and 5? But O must appear at least once, and not at position 3. Having O at other positions is fine.

But we have two O's? Possible? The feedback only said O is in the word and misplaced, but didn't say how many. So it could have multiple.

Similarly, I is at position 1: in ""spoil"" I was at position 4 and wrong. Position 1 is different.

L is at position 3: in ""spoil"" L was at position 5 and wrong. Position 3 is different? Yes.

Available letters: G is allowed? Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,S,P, so G is fine.

Word: ""IGLOO"" meaning an Inuit house? Or from video games? Valid word.

But we have duplicate O? That's okay as long as the word is valid.

However, we get feedback per letter? The feedback system might show both O's? But in rules, each letter is considered. But if the secret word has one O and our guess has O twice, it might cause issues? 

Recall the rules: each letter gets a symbol.

But secret word might have repeated letters? Yes, possible.

In our case, we don't know.

But let's compare ""IGLOO"" vs ""DOILY"":

""DOILY"" has distinct letters: D,O,I,L,Y
""IGLOO"" has I,G,L,O,O - so O repeated.

We have two unknowns: we need to cover more letters? 

With ""DOILY"" we test D and Y, which are new.

With ""IGLOO"" we test G and also test O twice? But since we know O is present, testing O might not give new information.

Moreover, I prefer distinct letters for maximum coverage, so ""DOILY"" is better.

Another word: ""GOLLY"" - G,O,L,L,Y - double L, no I? Inadequate.

""DOILY"" seems a good choice.

But let me confirm: is ""DOILY"" a valid 5-letter word?
Yes, as per dictionary: a small napkin.

So I'll go with ""DOILY"".

Alternative: ""BUOYL""? Not a word. Or ""QUOIN""? Q,U,O,I,N but N is excluded.

So ""DOILY"" it is.

Therefore, third guess: ""doily""

<guess>doily</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback:

- **First guess ""crane""**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x) in the secret word.  
- **Second guess ""spoil""**:  
  - S and P are absent (x).  
  - O, I, L are present but misplaced (-). O cannot be at position 3, I cannot be at position 4, and L cannot be at position 5 of the secret word.  

### Key Deductions:
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, E, S, P. These cannot appear in any guess.
- **Present letters**: O, I, L must appear in the secret word but in different positions than in ""spoil"".  
- **New letters needed**: The guess must include O, I, L and two new letters from the remaining alphabet (avoiding absent letters).  

### Choosing the Next Guess:
A strong candidate is **""DOILY""** (a valid 5-letter English word meaning a small ornamental mat). Here's why:  
1. **Includes O, I, L**: Confirms their presence while testing new positions:
   - O is placed at position 2 (not 3).
   - I is placed at position 3 (not 4).
   - L is placed at position 4 (not 5).  
2. **New letter coverage**: Adds D and Y, both not previously tested and not absent.  
3. **Avoids conflicts**: Uses no excluded letters (C,R,A,N,E,S,P).  

<guess>doily</guess>",doily,"We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters (C,R,A,N,E) are absent (x). So the secret word has none of these letters.
2. ""spoil"" -> S(x), P(x), O(-), I(-), L(-)

Important: 
- O, I, L are in the word but in the WRONG position.
- S and P are absent.

Since O, I, L are present but misplaced, they must be in the secret word, but not in the positions they were guessed in ""spoil"". 

In ""spoil"":
- O is in position 3
- I is in position 4
- L is in position 5

So in the secret word:
- O cannot be at position 3
- I cannot be at position 4
- L cannot be at position 5

Additionally, we know from Guess 1 that the letters C,R,A,N,E are absent, and from Guess 2 that S and P are absent. So the set of absent letters now includes: C, R, A, N, E, S, P.

Available letters: All letters except C,R,A,N,E,S,P. Very important to avoid these.

We also know that O, I, L must appear somewhere in the word.

Since O, I, L are present, but we don't know their correct positions yet.

We need to make a new guess that:
1. Includes O, I, and L (since they are in the word) but in different positions than in ""spoil"".
   - Specifically, O not at position 3, I not at position 4, L not at position 5.
2. Does not contain any absent letters: C,R,A,N,E,S,P.
3. The other two letters should be new ones, from the remaining alphabet.

Let me list possible letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

But note: we have two open positions since O,I,L take three positions. So we need two more letters.

Also, the word must be a valid 5-letter English word.

We also have to consider that O, I, L can be anywhere else.

Idea: try to place O, I, L in positions where they are allowed and add two new letters.

Possible new positions for O: any of 1,2,4,5 (since not position 3)
Similarly, I: any of 1,2,3,5 (not 4)
L: any of 1,2,3,4 (not 5)

We can rearrange them arbitrarily as long as they are not in the forbidden positions.

But we have to form a valid word.

Also, we can use the fact that O and I are vowels, so probably the word has a vowel somewhere.

Let me try to think of words containing O, I, L and two other new letters.

Consider words ending with L? But remember, L cannot be at position 5, so perhaps L at 1,2,3, or 4.

Similarly, O cannot be at 3.

I am considering common words with O,I,L.

Possible words:
- Could it be ""OIL""? But that's only 3 letters, so we need a 5-letter word.

We need two more letters.

One idea: words like ""BUILD"", but that has U and I, and D. But note: U is not excluded. However, ""BUILD"" has B,U,I,L,D.

Check letters: B,U,I,L,D. None are in the excluded set? 
Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,S,P. So U and B and D are allowed.

But in ""BUILD"", I is at position 3 and L is at position 4? Let's spell:
- Position 1: B
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: L
- Position 5: D

But in our feedback for ""spoil"", I was at position 4 (which is incorrect), but that doesn't mean I cannot be at position 3? 
Wait: The feedback for I was at position 4 being wrong, but it could be at position 3? Yes, because that wasn't tested.

Similarly, L was at position 5 and was wrong, but could L be at position 4? Yes.

However, O is also in the word. In ""BUILD"", there is no O. So it would be missing O, but O must be in the word.

Therefore, any guess must include O, I, and L.

So ""BUILD"" doesn't have O, so it cannot work.

We need a word that contains O, I, L and two other non-excluded letters.

Let me list some possibilities:

- How about ""TOIL""? But that's 4 letters. Need 5 letters.
We can have ""TOILS"" but S is excluded (from feedback: S is absent). So no.

- ""BOILS"" - but S is absent and P? No, S is excluded.

S is excluded, so no words with S.

Similarly, no P.

What about ""MOUTH""? But that has M,O,U,T,H. It has O, but lacks I and L.

We need I and L too.

The word must have at least O,I,L.

That means it must contain those three, plus two more letters from the allowed set.

So let me focus: O, I, L plus two from: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Also, the positions must be such that O not at 3, I not at 4, L not at 5.

Therefore, let's try to construct:

Option: Place O at position 1? Then I and L elsewhere.

Words starting with O: what words start with O and have I and L?

For example: ""OILER"" - O,I,L,E? But E is excluded (from guess 1). E(x), so absent.

""OILED"" - E and D. Again E is excluded.

""OIL"" in different positions? 

How about ""OLDIE"": O, L, D, I, E. But E is excluded.

No E.

What about ""GUILT""? G, U, I, L, T. No O.

We need O.

Another idea: ""VOILA"" - V,O,I,L,A. But A is excluded (from guess 1: A(x)).

A is out.

""DOILY"" - D,O,I,L,Y. Letters: D,O,I,L,Y.

All these letters: D,O,I,L,Y are allowed? 
Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,S,P. So D,O,I,L,Y are all okay.

Now, positions in ""DOILY"":
- D at 1
- O at 2
- I at 3
- L at 4
- Y at 5

Now, check if the forbidden positions are avoided:
- O cannot be at position 3? In ""DOILY"", O is at 2, which is fine. (O not at 3: okay)
- I cannot be at position 4? In ""DOILY"", I is at 3, which is a different position. Fine.
- L cannot be at position 5? In ""DOILY"", L is at 4, not 5. Fine.

Also, we get two new letters: D and Y.

Valid English word? ""DOILY"" means a small ornamental mat, yes.

So let's consider ""DOILY"".

But note: In ""spoil"", O was at position 3 and marked wrong (-), meaning it is elsewhere. In ""DOILY"", O is at 2, which is different.

Similarly, I was at 4 in ""spoil"", now at 3 in ""DOILY"", which is different and allowed since the feedback only said position 4 was wrong for I.

L was at 5 in ""spoil"", now at 4 in ""DOILY"", different.

So this seems good.

Are there other possibilities?

Another word: ""MOULD"" - M,O,U,L,D. But lacks I? We need I too.

Must have I.

""KOJI"" is not 5 letters.

""LOGIN"" - but has L,O,G,I,N. But N is excluded (from guess 1: N(x)).

N is out.

""YOGIS"" - has Y,O,G,I,S, but S is excluded.

What about ""GHOUL""? G,H,O,U,L. But no I.

We need O,I,L all together.

""TOXIC"" - T,O,X,I,C. C is excluded.

""JOLLY"" - J,O,L,L,Y. But has double L? And no I? It has O,L,Y, but misses I.

I is mandatory.

""BILLY"" - B,I,L,L,Y. Double L? And O is missing? Have I and L, no O.

O is mandatory.

So ""DOILY"" seems a strong candidate.

Another possibility: ""BIOIL""? Not a word.

""LOUIE"" - L,O,U,I,E, but E is excluded.

""WIELD"" - W,I,E,L,D, E excluded and no O.

So it's challenging.

Perhaps ""DITTO"" - D,I,T,T,O. But it has duplicate T? And no L? L is mandatory.

We require L.

Another idea: ""IGLOO"" - I,G,L,O,O. Has O twice? Positions:
1. I
2. G
3. L
4. O
5. O

But check positions:
- O: In ""spoil"", O was at position 3. Now we have O at positions 4 and 5? But O must appear at least once, and not at position 3. Having O at other positions is fine.

But we have two O's? Possible? The feedback only said O is in the word and misplaced, but didn't say how many. So it could have multiple.

Similarly, I is at position 1: in ""spoil"" I was at position 4 and wrong. Position 1 is different.

L is at position 3: in ""spoil"" L was at position 5 and wrong. Position 3 is different? Yes.

Available letters: G is allowed? Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,S,P, so G is fine.

Word: ""IGLOO"" meaning an Inuit house? Or from video games? Valid word.

But we have duplicate O? That's okay as long as the word is valid.

However, we get feedback per letter? The feedback system might show both O's? But in rules, each letter is considered. But if the secret word has one O and our guess has O twice, it might cause issues? 

Recall the rules: each letter gets a symbol.

But secret word might have repeated letters? Yes, possible.

In our case, we don't know.

But let's compare ""IGLOO"" vs ""DOILY"":

""DOILY"" has distinct letters: D,O,I,L,Y
""IGLOO"" has I,G,L,O,O - so O repeated.

We have two unknowns: we need to cover more letters? 

With ""DOILY"" we test D and Y, which are new.

With ""IGLOO"" we test G and also test O twice? But since we know O is present, testing O might not give new information.

Moreover, I prefer distinct letters for maximum coverage, so ""DOILY"" is better.

Another word: ""GOLLY"" - G,O,L,L,Y - double L, no I? Inadequate.

""DOILY"" seems a good choice.

But let me confirm: is ""DOILY"" a valid 5-letter word?
Yes, as per dictionary: a small napkin.

So I'll go with ""DOILY"".

Alternative: ""BUOYL""? Not a word. Or ""QUOIN""? Q,U,O,I,N but N is excluded.

So ""DOILY"" it is.

Therefore, third guess: ""doily""

<guess>doily</guess>Based on the feedback:

- **First guess ""crane""**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x) in the secret word.  
- **Second guess ""spoil""**:  
  - S and P are absent (x).  
  - O, I, L are present but misplaced (-). O cannot be at position 3, I cannot be at position 4, and L cannot be at position 5 of the secret word.  

### Key Deductions:
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, E, S, P. These cannot appear in any guess.

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,igloo,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"" which was all incorrect: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x). This means that none of these letters are in the secret word at all.
 Since none of the letters in ""crane"" appear in the secret word, we need to choose a new word that avoids all these letters.

 Letters to avoid: C, R, A, N, E.

 We should pick a word that uses other common vowels and consonants.

 Common vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out)
 Common consonants: We have many, such as S, T, L, P, M, B, D, G, H, K, etc.

 We want a word that has five new letters and is likely to give us more information.

 Considering words without C, R, A, N, E.

 A good candidate might be ""SPOIL"", but let's check for more common words.

 Another common starting word is ""SLOTH"", but note that O is a vowel.

 Alternatively, ""TOILS"" or ""TULIP"". However, we want to maximize coverage.

 Let's try to include I and O since they are common vowels.

 Possible words: 
   ""PIOUS"" - letters P, I, O, U, S
   ""FOULS"" - F, O, U, L, S
   ""STOMP"" - S, T, O, M, P

 But note: we also have U and sometimes Y (though less common). We don't know if the word has any vowels yet, so including multiple vowels is good.

 Considering the feedback, our next guess should avoid C,R,A,N,E entirely.

 I think ""SPOIL"" is a good choice: S, P, O, I, L. All these letters are common and distinct.

 Another option: ""BUILT"" has B, U, I, L, T.

 But let's pick one. We'll go with ""SPOIL"".

 So, second guess: ""spoil""

<guess>spoil</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked as not in the word (x), I need to choose a new word with **completely different letters**. Since none of these letters appear in the secret word, my next guess must avoid C, R, A, N, and E entirely.

For optimal information gain:
- Choose a word with common letters not yet tested, like S, T, O, L, I, P, M, B, or D.
- Prioritize vowels still available (O, I, U) and high-frequency consonants.
- Ensure all 5 letters are unique and valid.

A strong second guess is **""SPOIL""** because:
- Uses new common letters: S, P, O, I, L.
- Includes the vowels O and I.
- Tests 5 distinct, untried letters to maximize feedback.

<guess>spoil</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: spoil -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(-) I(-) L(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters (C,R,A,N,E) are absent (x). So the secret word has none of these letters.
2. ""spoil"" -> S(x), P(x), O(-), I(-), L(-)

Important: 
- O, I, L are in the word but in the WRONG position.
- S and P are absent.

Since O, I, L are present but misplaced, they must be in the secret word, but not in the positions they were guessed in ""spoil"". 

In ""spoil"":
- O is in position 3
- I is in position 4
- L is in position 5

So in the secret word:
- O cannot be at position 3
- I cannot be at position 4
- L cannot be at position 5

Additionally, we know from Guess 1 that the letters C,R,A,N,E are absent, and from Guess 2 that S and P are absent. So the set of absent letters now includes: C, R, A, N, E, S, P.

Available letters: All letters except C,R,A,N,E,S,P. Very important to avoid these.

We also know that O, I, L must appear somewhere in the word.

Since O, I, L are present, but we don't know their correct positions yet.

We need to make a new guess that:
1. Includes O, I, and L (since they are in the word) but in different positions than in ""spoil"".
   - Specifically, O not at position 3, I not at position 4, L not at position 5.
2. Does not contain any absent letters: C,R,A,N,E,S,P.
3. The other two letters should be new ones, from the remaining alphabet.

Let me list possible letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

But note: we have two open positions since O,I,L take three positions. So we need two more letters.

Also, the word must be a valid 5-letter English word.

We also have to consider that O, I, L can be anywhere else.

Idea: try to place O, I, L in positions where they are allowed and add two new letters.

Possible new positions for O: any of 1,2,4,5 (since not position 3)
Similarly, I: any of 1,2,3,5 (not 4)
L: any of 1,2,3,4 (not 5)

We can rearrange them arbitrarily as long as they are not in the forbidden positions.

But we have to form a valid word.

Also, we can use the fact that O and I are vowels, so probably the word has a vowel somewhere.

Let me try to think of words containing O, I, L and two other new letters.

Consider words ending with L? But remember, L cannot be at position 5, so perhaps L at 1,2,3, or 4.

Similarly, O cannot be at 3.

I am considering common words with O,I,L.

Possible words:
- Could it be ""OIL""? But that's only 3 letters, so we need a 5-letter word.

We need two more letters.

One idea: words like ""BUILD"", but that has U and I, and D. But note: U is not excluded. However, ""BUILD"" has B,U,I,L,D.

Check letters: B,U,I,L,D. None are in the excluded set? 
Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,S,P. So U and B and D are allowed.

But in ""BUILD"", I is at position 3 and L is at position 4? Let's spell:
- Position 1: B
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: L
- Position 5: D

But in our feedback for ""spoil"", I was at position 4 (which is incorrect), but that doesn't mean I cannot be at position 3? 
Wait: The feedback for I was at position 4 being wrong, but it could be at position 3? Yes, because that wasn't tested.

Similarly, L was at position 5 and was wrong, but could L be at position 4? Yes.

However, O is also in the word. In ""BUILD"", there is no O. So it would be missing O, but O must be in the word.

Therefore, any guess must include O, I, and L.

So ""BUILD"" doesn't have O, so it cannot work.

We need a word that contains O, I, L and two other non-excluded letters.

Let me list some possibilities:

- How about ""TOIL""? But that's 4 letters. Need 5 letters.
We can have ""TOILS"" but S is excluded (from feedback: S is absent). So no.

- ""BOILS"" - but S is absent and P? No, S is excluded.

S is excluded, so no words with S.

Similarly, no P.

What about ""MOUTH""? But that has M,O,U,T,H. It has O, but lacks I and L.

We need I and L too.

The word must have at least O,I,L.

That means it must contain those three, plus two more letters from the allowed set.

So let me focus: O, I, L plus two from: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Also, the positions must be such that O not at 3, I not at 4, L not at 5.

Therefore, let's try to construct:

Option: Place O at position 1? Then I and L elsewhere.

Words starting with O: what words start with O and have I and L?

For example: ""OILER"" - O,I,L,E? But E is excluded (from guess 1). E(x), so absent.

""OILED"" - E and D. Again E is excluded.

""OIL"" in different positions? 

How about ""OLDIE"": O, L, D, I, E. But E is excluded.

No E.

What about ""GUILT""? G, U, I, L, T. No O.

We need O.

Another idea: ""VOILA"" - V,O,I,L,A. But A is excluded (from guess 1: A(x)).

A is out.

""DOILY"" - D,O,I,L,Y. Letters: D,O,I,L,Y.

All these letters: D,O,I,L,Y are allowed? 
Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,S,P. So D,O,I,L,Y are all okay.

Now, positions in ""DOILY"":
- D at 1
- O at 2
- I at 3
- L at 4
- Y at 5

Now, check if the forbidden positions are avoided:
- O cannot be at position 3? In ""DOILY"", O is at 2, which is fine. (O not at 3: okay)
- I cannot be at position 4? In ""DOILY"", I is at 3, which is a different position. Fine.
- L cannot be at position 5? In ""DOILY"", L is at 4, not 5. Fine.

Also, we get two new letters: D and Y.

Valid English word? ""DOILY"" means a small ornamental mat, yes.

So let's consider ""DOILY"".

But note: In ""spoil"", O was at position 3 and marked wrong (-), meaning it is elsewhere. In ""DOILY"", O is at 2, which is different.

Similarly, I was at 4 in ""spoil"", now at 3 in ""DOILY"", which is different and allowed since the feedback only said position 4 was wrong for I.

L was at 5 in ""spoil"", now at 4 in ""DOILY"", different.

So this seems good.

Are there other possibilities?

Another word: ""MOULD"" - M,O,U,L,D. But lacks I? We need I too.

Must have I.

""KOJI"" is not 5 letters.

""LOGIN"" - but has L,O,G,I,N. But N is excluded (from guess 1: N(x)).

N is out.

""YOGIS"" - has Y,O,G,I,S, but S is excluded.

What about ""GHOUL""? G,H,O,U,L. But no I.

We need O,I,L all together.

""TOXIC"" - T,O,X,I,C. C is excluded.

""JOLLY"" - J,O,L,L,Y. But has double L? And no I? It has O,L,Y, but misses I.

I is mandatory.

""BILLY"" - B,I,L,L,Y. Double L? And O is missing? Have I and L, no O.

O is mandatory.

So ""DOILY"" seems a strong candidate.

Another possibility: ""BIOIL""? Not a word.

""LOUIE"" - L,O,U,I,E, but E is excluded.

""WIELD"" - W,I,E,L,D, E excluded and no O.

So it's challenging.

Perhaps ""DITTO"" - D,I,T,T,O. But it has duplicate T? And no L? L is mandatory.

We require L.

Another idea: ""IGLOO"" - I,G,L,O,O. Has O twice? Positions:
1. I
2. G
3. L
4. O
5. O

But check positions:
- O: In ""spoil"", O was at position 3. Now we have O at positions 4 and 5? But O must appear at least once, and not at position 3. Having O at other positions is fine.

But we have two O's? Possible? The feedback only said O is in the word and misplaced, but didn't say how many. So it could have multiple.

Similarly, I is at position 1: in ""spoil"" I was at position 4 and wrong. Position 1 is different.

L is at position 3: in ""spoil"" L was at position 5 and wrong. Position 3 is different? Yes.

Available letters: G is allowed? Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,S,P, so G is fine.

Word: ""IGLOO"" meaning an Inuit house? Or from video games? Valid word.

But we have duplicate O? That's okay as long as the word is valid.

However, we get feedback per letter? The feedback system might show both O's? But in rules, each letter is considered. But if the secret word has one O and our guess has O twice, it might cause issues? 

Recall the rules: each letter gets a symbol.

But secret word might have repeated letters? Yes, possible.

In our case, we don't know.

But let's compare ""IGLOO"" vs ""DOILY"":

""DOILY"" has distinct letters: D,O,I,L,Y
""IGLOO"" has I,G,L,O,O - so O repeated.

We have two unknowns: we need to cover more letters? 

With ""DOILY"" we test D and Y, which are new.

With ""IGLOO"" we test G and also test O twice? But since we know O is present, testing O might not give new information.

Moreover, I prefer distinct letters for maximum coverage, so ""DOILY"" is better.

Another word: ""GOLLY"" - G,O,L,L,Y - double L, no I? Inadequate.

""DOILY"" seems a good choice.

But let me confirm: is ""DOILY"" a valid 5-letter word?
Yes, as per dictionary: a small napkin.

So I'll go with ""DOILY"".

Alternative: ""BUOYL""? Not a word. Or ""QUOIN""? Q,U,O,I,N but N is excluded.

So ""DOILY"" it is.

Therefore, third guess: ""doily""

<guess>doily</guess>Based on the feedback:

- **First guess ""crane""**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x) in the secret word.  
- **Second guess ""spoil""**:  
  - S and P are absent (x).  
  - O, I, L are present but misplaced (-). O cannot be at position 3, I cannot be at position 4, and L cannot be at position 5 of the secret word.  

### Key Deductions:
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, E, S, P. These cannot appear in any guess.
- **Present letters**: O, I, L must appear in the secret word but in different positions than in ""spoil"".  
- **New letters needed**: The guess must include O, I, L and two new letters from the remaining alphabet (avoiding absent letters).  

### Choosing the Next Guess:
A strong candidate is **""DOILY""** (a valid 5-letter English word meaning a small ornamental mat). Here's why:  
1. **Includes O, I, L**: Confirms their presence while testing new positions:
   - O is placed at position 2 (not 3).
   - I is placed at position 3 (not 4).
   - L is placed at position 4 (not 5).  
2. **New letter coverage**: Adds D and Y, both not previously tested and not absent.  
3. **Avoids conflicts**: Uses no excluded letters (C,R,A,N,E,S,P).

Yes, because that wasn\'t tested.\n\nSimilarly, L was at position 5 and was wrong, but could L be at position 4? Yes.\n\nHowever, O is also in the word. In ""BUILD"", there is no O. So it would be missing O, but O must be in the word.\n\nTherefore, any guess must include O, I, and L.\n\nSo ""BUILD"" doesn\'t have O, so it cannot work.\n\nWe need a word that contains O, I, L and two other non-excluded letters.\n\nLet me list some possibilities:\n\n- How about ""TOIL""? But that\'s 4 letters. Need 5 letters.\nWe can have ""TOILS"" but S is excluded (from feedback: S is absent). So no.\n\n- ""BOILS"" - but S is absent and P? No, S is excluded.\n\nS is excluded, so no words with S.\n\nSimilarly, no P.\n\nWhat about ""MOUTH""? But that has M,O,U,T,H. It has O, but lacks I and L.\n\nWe need I and L too.\n\nThe word must have at least O,I,L.\n\nThat means it must contain those three, plus two more letters from the allowed set.\n\nSo let me focus: O, I, L plus two from: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nAlso, the positions must be such that O not at 3, I not at 4, L not at 5.\n\nTherefore, let\'s try to construct:\n\nOption: Place O at position 1?

E(x), so absent.\n\n""OILED"" - E and D. Again E is excluded.\n\n""OIL"" in different positions? \n\nHow about ""OLDIE"": O, L, D, I, E. But E is excluded.\n\nNo E.\n\nWhat about ""GUILT""?

In ""DOILY"", O is at 2, which is fine. (O not at 3: okay)\n- I cannot be at position 4? In ""DOILY"", I is at 3, which is a different position. Fine.\n- L cannot be at position 5? In ""DOILY"", L is at 4, not 5. Fine.\n\nAlso, we get two new letters: D and Y.\n\nValid English word? ""DOILY"" means a small ornamental mat, yes.\n\nSo let\'s consider ""DOILY"".\n\nBut note: In ""spoil"", O was at position 3 and marked wrong (-), meaning it is elsewhere.

But lacks I? We need I too.\n\nMust have I.\n\n""KOJI"" is not 5 letters.\n\n""LOGIN"" - but has L,O,G,I,N.

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x) → All absent. So the secret word has none of these letters.

Guess 2: ""spoil"" -> S(x), P(x), O(-), I(-), L(-) → S and P are absent. O, I, L are present but in the wrong positions.

From this, we know:
- O is in the word, but not at position 3.
- I is in the word, but not at position 4.
- L is in the word, but not at position 5.

Guess 3: ""doily"" -> D(x), O(-), I(-), L(-), Y(x) → D and Y are absent. O, I, L are present but in the wrong positions.

Now, for O, I, L in ""doily"":
- O is at position 2 → feedback is (-), so O is not at position 2 in the secret word.
- I is at position 3 → (-), so not at position 3.
- L is at position 4 → (-), so not at position 4.

We also have new absent letters: D and Y.

So now, the full set of absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, D, Y.

Present letters: O, I, L (each must be in the word, but we don't know the positions).

We have three known present letters: O, I, L. They must be in the word, but we have constraints on their positions:

From ""spoil"":
- O not at pos 3
- I not at pos 4
- L not at pos 5

From ""doily"":
- O not at pos 2
- I not at pos 3
- L not at pos 4

Combining the constraints for each:

For O: cannot be at pos 2 (from doily) or pos 3 (from spoil). So possible positions: 1, 4, 5.

For I: cannot be at pos 4 (spoil) or pos 3 (doily). So possible positions: 1, 2, 5.

For L: cannot be at pos 5 (spoil) or pos 4 (doily). So possible positions: 1, 2, 3.

We need to form a 5-letter word that includes O, I, L and two other letters that are not in the absent set.

Available letters (consonants and vowels): 
Absent: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,D,Y → so we avoid these.

Remaining letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z

We also have to consider that the word must be a valid English word.

We have three positions to fill: the word has 5 letters, and we have O, I, L to place in three of them, but we need to choose positions that satisfy the constraints, and the other two letters from the available set.

Since we have three fixed letters, we need to choose two more and arrange all.

We can think of the positions:

Let me denote the positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

Constraints:
- O: can be at 1,4,5
- I: can be at 1,2,5
- L: can be at 1,2,3

But note: each position can have only one letter, and we must assign each of O, I, L to a position that is allowed for it, and the other two positions with new letters.

We also need to avoid the absent letters.

Now, we must cover all five positions.

Let me try to find a word that fits.

First, consider possible positions for L: 1,2,3.

Case 1: L at position 1.
Then, for O: can be at 4 or 5 (since 1 is taken, and O cannot be at 2 or 3).
For I: can be at 2,5 (since 1 is taken, and I cannot be at 3 or 4? Wait, I cannot be at 3 or 4, but 3 is available? I can be at 2 or 5.

If L at 1:
- Position 1: L
- Then O must be at 4 or 5.
- I must be at 2 or 5.

But if O is at 5 and I at 2, that works. Or O at 4 and I at 2, or O at 4 and I at 5, or O at 5 and I at 2? Let's list:

Option A: L at 1, I at 2, O at 4 → then positions 3 and 5 need to be filled.
Option B: L at 1, I at 2, O at 5 → positions 3 and 4.
Option C: L at 1, I at 5, O at 4 → positions 2 and 3.
Option D: L at 1, I at 5, O at 5 → conflict, position 5 cannot have two letters.

So possible: A, B, C.

Similarly, if L at 2:
- L at 2.
- O can be at 1,4,5 (but 2 taken, so 1,4,5)
- I can be at 1,5 (since 2 taken, and cannot be at 3 or 4? I cannot be at 3 or 4, so only 1 or 5? But position 2 is taken, so I at 1 or 5.

So:
Option E: L at 2, O at 1, I at 5 → positions 3 and 4.
Option F: L at 2, O at 4, I at 1 → positions 3 and 5.
Option G: L at 2, O at 4, I at 5 → positions 1 and 3.
Option H: L at 2, O at 5, I at 1 → positions 3 and 4? O at 5, I at 1: positions 3 and 4 open.
Option I: L at 2, O at 5, I at 5 → conflict.

And if L at 3:
- L at 3.
- O can be at 1,4,5 (3 taken, so 1,4,5)
- I can be at 1,2,5 (3 taken, so 1,2,5)

So:
Option J: L at 3, O at 1, I at 2 → positions 4 and 5.
Option K: L at 3, O at 1, I at 5 → positions 2 and 4.
Option L: L at 3, O at 4, I at 1 → positions 2 and 5.
Option M: L at 3, O at 4, I at 2 → positions 1 and 5.
Option N: L at 3, O at 4, I at 5 → positions 1 and 2.
Option O: L at 3, O at 5, I at 1 → positions 2 and 4.
Option P: L at 3, O at 5, I at 2 → positions 1 and 4.
Option Q: L at 3, O at 5, I at 5 → conflict.

Now, we need to fill the remaining positions with letters from the available set: B,F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Z.

And form a valid word.

We also have to consider that in the feedback, for ""doily"", O, I, L were all misplaced, so in the new word, they must be in different positions.

Now, let's try to find a word that matches one of these patterns.

Start with L at position 1: Option A: L at 1, I at 2, O at 4 → positions 3 and 5 to fill.

So pattern: L I ? O ?

We need a word: L I _ O _

With the blank positions 3 and 5 filled with letters not absent.

Possible words? Like ""LIGHT"" but G and H, but ""LIGHT"" has I at 2, O? No, ""LIGHT"" is L,I,G,H,T → no O.

""LIMBO"" - L,I,M,B,O → but O is at position 5, not 4. We need O at 4.

In this pattern, O must be at 4.

So ""L I ? O ?"" → position 4 is O.

What words start with ""LI"" and have O at position 4? And 5th letter.

For example, ""LILIO"" not a word.

""LINGO"" but N is absent.

""LIVID"" but V and D, D is absent.

""LIBRO"" but B,R,O? R is absent.

R is absent? From guess 1, R(x), so absent.

Available: B,F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Z

""LITIO"" not a word.

""LIKEO"" not a word.

""LIMO"" is 4 letters.

""LITHO"" - L,I,T,H,O → positions: L1, I2, T3, H4, O5 → but we need O at position 4? Here O is at 5.

Not matching.

Perhaps no common word for this pattern.

Option B: L at 1, I at 2, O at 5 → pattern: L I ? ? O

So word: L I _ _ O

Examples: ""LINGO"" but N absent.

""LITMO"" not a word.

""LIVID"" but D absent.

""LIGHT"" no O.

""LIMBO"" - L,I,M,B,O → that's L1,I2,M3,B4,O5 → so O at 5, which matches. And M and B are allowed? M and B not absent.

""LIMBO"" is a word.

But check constraints: O at position 5? In ""spoil"", O was at 3 and wrong, and in ""doily"" O at 2 and wrong, but position 5 is allowed for O? Yes, from above O can be at 5.

I at position 2: in ""spoil"" I was at 4 and wrong, in ""doily"" at 3 and wrong, position 2 is allowed for I? Yes, I can be at 2.

L at position 1: in ""spoil"" L was at 5 and wrong, in ""doily"" at 4 and wrong, position 1 is allowed for L? Yes.

So ""LIMBO"" seems possible.

But we have to check if it uses only allowed letters: L,I,M,B,O. M and B are not absent, so allowed.

But O is already known, so we are testing M and B.

Now, Option C: L at 1, I at 5, O at 4 → pattern: L ? ? O I

Word: L _ _ O I

Like ""LOOBI"" not a word.

""LOTUS"" but T,U,S? S absent.

""LOCUS"" S absent.

""LOVAT"" not common.

""LOGIC"" but G,I,C? C absent and I at 5? ""LOGIC"" is L,O,G,I,C → C absent and positions: O at 2, not 4.

Not matching.

So ""LIMBO"" is a candidate.

Now, other cases.

L at 2: Option E: L at 2, O at 1, I at 5 → pattern: O L ? ? I

Word: O L _ _ I

Examples: ""OLIVE"" but V,E? E absent.

""OLIVI"" not a word.

""OLPHA"" not a word.

Not easy.

Option F: L at 2, O at 4, I at 1 → pattern: I L ? O ?

Word: I L _ O _

Like ""ILIUM"" but M,U? ""ILIUM"" is I,L,I,U,M? Not 5 distinct? And U and M.

But I repeated? ""ILIUM"" has two I's? Positions: I1, L2, I3, U4, M5? But we need O at 4, here U at 4.

Not.

""ILKDO"" not a word.

Option G: L at 2, O at 4, I at 5 → pattern: ? L ? O I

Word: _ L _ O I

Like ""ALOFT"" but A absent.

""BLOKI"" not a word.

""GLYPH"" but G,L,Y? Y absent.

Y is absent from guess 3.

Option H: L at 2, O at 5, I at 1 → pattern: I L ? ? O

Word: I L _ _ O

Like ""ILKDO"" no.

""IMAGE"" but M,A,G,E? A and E absent.

Not.

Now L at 3: Option J: L at 3, O at 1, I at 2 → pattern: O I L ? ?

Word: O I L _ _

Like ""OILED"" but E,D absent.

""OILER"" E absent.

""OILTY"" not a word.

Option K: L at 3, O at 1, I at 5 → pattern: O ? L ? I

Word: O _ L _ I

Like ""OWLFI"" no.

""OCTLI"" not a word.

Option L: L at 3, O at 4, I at 1 → pattern: I ? L O ?

Word: I _ L O _

Like ""IDOLA"" but D,A absent.

""IGLOO"" but G,O,O? O repeated, and we have I at 1, G at 2, L at 3, O at 4 and 5? But pattern: I _ L O _ , so position 5 is open.

""IGLOO"" is I,G,L,O,O → so positions: I1, G2, L3, O4, O5. So it matches the pattern I _ L O _ with the last being O.

But we have O at 4 and 5? But in the pattern, we have O at 4, and position 5 is filled with O, which is fine.

But we already considered ""IGLOO"" earlier? But in ""IGLOO"", L is at position 3, which is allowed? L can be at 3? Yes, from constraints.

O at 4: in ""spoil"" O was at 3 and wrong, so position 4 is new and allowed. In ""doily"" O was at 2 and wrong, so position 4 is not forbidden for O? O cannot be at 2 or 3, so 4 is okay.

I at 1: in ""spoil"" I was at 4 and wrong, in ""doily"" at 3 and wrong, so position 1 is allowed.

So ""IGLOO"" is a possible word.

But it has two O's? That's acceptable.

Letters: I,G,L,O,O. G is new and allowed.

But we already have O,I,L present, so we are testing G.

Now, back to ""LIMBO"" and ""IGLOO"".

We have two candidates: ""LIMBO"" and ""IGLOO"".

But in ""LIMBO"", we have M and B, two new letters.

In ""IGLOO"", we have G and an extra O.

But O is already known, so we get less new information? But we might confirm if there is a double O.

But we don't know.

Perhaps we can choose a word with more new letters.

Another option: Option M: L at 3, O at 4, I at 2 → pattern: ? I L O ?

Word: _ I L O _

Like ""WILCO"" not common.

""KILOS"" but S absent.

""TILTH"" T,H? ""TILTH"" is T,I,L,T,H? Not 5 distinct? T repeated.

""BILLY"" but Y absent and no O.

Not.

Option N: L at 3, O at 4, I at 5 → pattern: ? ? L O I

Word: _ _ L O I

Like ""BLOKI"" no.

""GLYCO"" not.

Option O: L at 3, O at 5, I at 1 → pattern: I ? L ? O

Word: I _ L _ O

Like ""IDOLO"" but D absent.

""IGLOO"" is I,G,L,O,O → but O at 4 and 5, not at 5 only? Pattern I _ L _ O would be I at1, ? at2, L at3, ? at4, O at5.

But in ""IGLOO"", it's I at1, G at2, L at3, O at4, O at5 → so position 4 is O, not the fifth? For the pattern I _ L _ O, we need O at position 5, but in ""IGLOO"" position 5 is O, but position 4 is also O, so it doesn't match the pattern exactly? The pattern requires a letter at position 4, but in ""IGLOO"" it's O, which is fine, but the pattern for Option O is I at1, ? at2, L at3, ? at4, O at5.

In ""IGLOO"", position 4 is O, which is not a new letter, but the pattern allows it? The pattern doesn't specify what is at 4, it can be O.

But in this case, for Option O, we have I at1, L at3, O at5, and positions 2 and 4 to fill.

In ""IGLOO"", position 2 is G and position 4 is O, so it fits if we consider position 4 as O, which is allowed.

But Option O is for L at3, O at5, I at1.

In ""IGLOO"", O is at5? Position 5 is O, yes. And O at4 is extra.

But the pattern is satisfied.

Similarly, Option P: L at3, O at5, I at2 → pattern: ? I L ? O

Word: _ I L _ O

Like ""FILMO"" not a word.

""WILCO"" not.

So the main candidates are ""LIMBO"" and ""IGLOO"".

Now, which one to choose?

""LIMBO"" tests two new letters: M and B.

""IGLOO"" tests one new letter: G, and might indicate if O is repeated.

But since we have limited guesses, testing more new letters might be better.

Also, ""LIMBO"" is a valid word.

Another word: what about ""MILKO""? Not common.

Or ""TOUCH"" but T,O,U,C,H? C absent.

Perhaps ""GUILD"" but U,I,L,D? D absent and no O.

D is absent.

Another possibility: Option from L at1, I at5, O at4: we didn't find a word.

But let's list all possible words we can think of with O,I,L and two new letters.

For example, ""OIL"" with extensions? Hard.

""FOUL"" but F,O,U,L? No I.

""JOINT"" but J,O,I,N,T? N absent.

""QUOIT"" Q,U,O,I,T? But Q and U, and T. N not present? ""QUOIT"" is a word, but let's see: Q,U,O,I,T.

Letters: Q,U,O,I,T. All not absent? Absent: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,D,Y. So Q,U,O,I,T are all allowed.

Now, positions: we need to place O,I,L? But ""QUOIT"" has O,I, but no L? L is required! We must have L in the word.

""QUOIT"" does not have L, so it cannot be, because L is present.

Similarly, ""BUOYS"" but S absent and no I,L.

We must include L.

Another word: ""BUILT"" but U,I,L,T? No O.

""OLLIE"" but O,L,L,I,E? E absent and double L.

Not.

""LOTUS"" S absent.

Perhaps ""LIMBO"" is the best so far.

""THOLI"" not common.

""VOTIVE"" 6 letters.

I think ""LIMBO"" is a good guess.

But let's confirm the positions in ""LIMBO"":

- L at position 1
- I at position 2
- M at position 3
- B at position 4
- O at position 5

Now, constraints:

For O: must not be at 2 or 3. Here at 5, which is allowed.

For I: must not be at 3 or 4. Here at 2, which is allowed.

For L: must not be at 4 or 5. Here at 1, which is allowed.

And M and B are new.

So it should be fine.

Similarly, ""IGLOO"": I at1, G at2, L at3, O at4, O at5.

O at4: allowed? O cannot be at 2 or 3, so 4 is new and allowed.

L at3: allowed? L cannot be at 4 or 5, so 3 is allowed.

I at1: allowed? I cannot be at 3 or 4, so 1 is allowed.

But O at5 is also present, but that's fine.

But in terms of information, ""LIMBO"" tests two new letters, so I prefer that.

We could also consider ""LOGIN"" but N absent.

So I'll go with ""LIMBO"".

But is ""LIMBO"" accepted? Yes.

So guess: ""LIMBO""

But in the feedback, we have to see.

Another word: ""BOWL"" not 5 letters.

""CLIMB"" C absent.

So ""LIMBO"" it is.

<guess>limbo</guess>
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Feedback from Previous Guesses**:
   - **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). These letters cannot be in the secret word.
   - **Guess 2 (""spoil"")**: 
     - S and P are absent (x), so they are also excluded.
     - O, I, L are present but misplaced (-). This means:
       - O is in the word, but not at position 3.
       - I is in the word, but not at position 4.
       - L is in the word, but not at position 5.
   - **Guess 3 (""doily"")**:
     - D and Y are absent (x), so they are excluded.
     - O, I, L are present but misplaced (-). This adds new constraints:
       - O is not at position 2 (since it was misplaced there in ""doily"").
       - I is not at position 3 (misplaced in ""doily"").
       - L is not at position 4 (misplaced in ""doily"").

2. **Deductions**:
   - **Absent Letters**: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, D, Y (9 letters excluded).
   - **Present Letters**: O, I, L must be in the secret word, but their positions are unknown. Constraints on their positions:
     - O: Cannot be at positions 2 or 3 → possible positions: 1, 4, or 5.
     - I: Cannot be at positions 3 or 4 → possible positions: 1, 2, or 5.
     - L: Cannot be at positions 4 or 5 → possible positions: 1, 2, or 3.
   - **Available Letters**: The secret word must include O, I, L, plus two new letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding absent letters). Remaining letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:
   - The new guess must:
     - Include O, I, and L (since they are confirmed present).
     - Place O, I, and L in positions that satisfy all constraints (e.g., O not at 2/3, I not at 3/4, L not at 4/5).
     - Use two new letters from the available set to maximize information.
     - Avoid all absent letters.
   - After evaluating possible words, **""LIMBO""** is a strong candidate because:
     - Letters: L, I, M, B, O.
       - O, I, L are included (required).
       - M and B are new, untested letters (from available set).
       - No absent letters are used.
     - Positions:
       - L at position 1: Allowed (L cannot be at 4/5, and position 1 is valid).
       - I at position 2: Allowed (I cannot be at 3/4, and position 2 is valid).
       - O at position 5: Allowed (O cannot be at 2/3, and position 5 is valid).
     - This tests new letters (M and B) while respecting all positional constraints for O, I, L.

4. **Why ""LIMBO""?**:
   - It is a valid 5-letter English word.
   - It adheres to all feedback constraints.
   - It maximizes new information by testing M and B, which could help identify more letters or positions in future guesses.
   - Alternatives like ""IGLOO"" were considered, but ""LIMBO"" is preferred for testing two new letters instead of one (G in ""IGLOO""), providing better coverage.

<guess>limbo</guess>",limbo,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x) → All absent. So the secret word has none of these letters.

Guess 2: ""spoil"" -> S(x), P(x), O(-), I(-), L(-) → S and P are absent. O, I, L are present but in the wrong positions.

From this, we know:
- O is in the word, but not at position 3.
- I is in the word, but not at position 4.
- L is in the word, but not at position 5.

Guess 3: ""doily"" -> D(x), O(-), I(-), L(-), Y(x) → D and Y are absent. O, I, L are present but in the wrong positions.

Now, for O, I, L in ""doily"":
- O is at position 2 → feedback is (-), so O is not at position 2 in the secret word.
- I is at position 3 → (-), so not at position 3.
- L is at position 4 → (-), so not at position 4.

We also have new absent letters: D and Y.

So now, the full set of absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, D, Y.

Present letters: O, I, L (each must be in the word, but we don't know the positions).

We have three known present letters: O, I, L. They must be in the word, but we have constraints on their positions:

From ""spoil"":
- O not at pos 3
- I not at pos 4
- L not at pos 5

From ""doily"":
- O not at pos 2
- I not at pos 3
- L not at pos 4

Combining the constraints for each:

For O: cannot be at pos 2 (from doily) or pos 3 (from spoil). So possible positions: 1, 4, 5.

For I: cannot be at pos 4 (spoil) or pos 3 (doily). So possible positions: 1, 2, 5.

For L: cannot be at pos 5 (spoil) or pos 4 (doily). So possible positions: 1, 2, 3.

We need to form a 5-letter word that includes O, I, L and two other letters that are not in the absent set.

Available letters (consonants and vowels): 
Absent: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,D,Y → so we avoid these.

Remaining letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z

We also have to consider that the word must be a valid English word.

We have three positions to fill: the word has 5 letters, and we have O, I, L to place in three of them, but we need to choose positions that satisfy the constraints, and the other two letters from the available set.

Since we have three fixed letters, we need to choose two more and arrange all.

We can think of the positions:

Let me denote the positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

Constraints:
- O: can be at 1,4,5
- I: can be at 1,2,5
- L: can be at 1,2,3

But note: each position can have only one letter, and we must assign each of O, I, L to a position that is allowed for it, and the other two positions with new letters.

We also need to avoid the absent letters.

Now, we must cover all five positions.

Let me try to find a word that fits.

First, consider possible positions for L: 1,2,3.

Case 1: L at position 1.
Then, for O: can be at 4 or 5 (since 1 is taken, and O cannot be at 2 or 3).
For I: can be at 2,5 (since 1 is taken, and I cannot be at 3 or 4? Wait, I cannot be at 3 or 4, but 3 is available? I can be at 2 or 5.

If L at 1:
- Position 1: L
- Then O must be at 4 or 5.
- I must be at 2 or 5.

But if O is at 5 and I at 2, that works. Or O at 4 and I at 2, or O at 4 and I at 5, or O at 5 and I at 2? Let's list:

Option A: L at 1, I at 2, O at 4 → then positions 3 and 5 need to be filled.
Option B: L at 1, I at 2, O at 5 → positions 3 and 4.
Option C: L at 1, I at 5, O at 4 → positions 2 and 3.
Option D: L at 1, I at 5, O at 5 → conflict, position 5 cannot have two letters.

So possible: A, B, C.

Similarly, if L at 2:
- L at 2.
- O can be at 1,4,5 (but 2 taken, so 1,4,5)
- I can be at 1,5 (since 2 taken, and cannot be at 3 or 4? I cannot be at 3 or 4, so only 1 or 5? But position 2 is taken, so I at 1 or 5.

So:
Option E: L at 2, O at 1, I at 5 → positions 3 and 4.
Option F: L at 2, O at 4, I at 1 → positions 3 and 5.
Option G: L at 2, O at 4, I at 5 → positions 1 and 3.
Option H: L at 2, O at 5, I at 1 → positions 3 and 4? O at 5, I at 1: positions 3 and 4 open.
Option I: L at 2, O at 5, I at 5 → conflict.

And if L at 3:
- L at 3.
- O can be at 1,4,5 (3 taken, so 1,4,5)
- I can be at 1,2,5 (3 taken, so 1,2,5)

So:
Option J: L at 3, O at 1, I at 2 → positions 4 and 5.
Option K: L at 3, O at 1, I at 5 → positions 2 and 4.
Option L: L at 3, O at 4, I at 1 → positions 2 and 5.
Option M: L at 3, O at 4, I at 2 → positions 1 and 5.
Option N: L at 3, O at 4, I at 5 → positions 1 and 2.
Option O: L at 3, O at 5, I at 1 → positions 2 and 4.
Option P: L at 3, O at 5, I at 2 → positions 1 and 4.
Option Q: L at 3, O at 5, I at 5 → conflict.

Now, we need to fill the remaining positions with letters from the available set: B,F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Z.

And form a valid word.

We also have to consider that in the feedback, for ""doily"", O, I, L were all misplaced, so in the new word, they must be in different positions.

Now, let's try to find a word that matches one of these patterns.

Start with L at position 1: Option A: L at 1, I at 2, O at 4 → positions 3 and 5 to fill.

So pattern: L I ? O ?

We need a word: L I _ O _

With the blank positions 3 and 5 filled with letters not absent.

Possible words? Like ""LIGHT"" but G and H, but ""LIGHT"" has I at 2, O? No, ""LIGHT"" is L,I,G,H,T → no O.

""LIMBO"" - L,I,M,B,O → but O is at position 5, not 4. We need O at 4.

In this pattern, O must be at 4.

So ""L I ? O ?"" → position 4 is O.

What words start with ""LI"" and have O at position 4? And 5th letter.

For example, ""LILIO"" not a word.

""LINGO"" but N is absent.

""LIVID"" but V and D, D is absent.

""LIBRO"" but B,R,O? R is absent.

R is absent? From guess 1, R(x), so absent.

Available: B,F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Z

""LITIO"" not a word.

""LIKEO"" not a word.

""LIMO"" is 4 letters.

""LITHO"" - L,I,T,H,O → positions: L1, I2, T3, H4, O5 → but we need O at position 4? Here O is at 5.

Not matching.

Perhaps no common word for this pattern.

Option B: L at 1, I at 2, O at 5 → pattern: L I ? ? O

So word: L I _ _ O

Examples: ""LINGO"" but N absent.

""LITMO"" not a word.

""LIVID"" but D absent.

""LIGHT"" no O.

""LIMBO"" - L,I,M,B,O → that's L1,I2,M3,B4,O5 → so O at 5, which matches. And M and B are allowed? M and B not absent.

""LIMBO"" is a word.

But check constraints: O at position 5? In ""spoil"", O was at 3 and wrong, and in ""doily"" O at 2 and wrong, but position 5 is allowed for O? Yes, from above O can be at 5.

I at position 2: in ""spoil"" I was at 4 and wrong, in ""doily"" at 3 and wrong, position 2 is allowed for I? Yes, I can be at 2.

L at position 1: in ""spoil"" L was at 5 and wrong, in ""doily"" at 4 and wrong, position 1 is allowed for L? Yes.

So ""LIMBO"" seems possible.

But we have to check if it uses only allowed letters: L,I,M,B,O. M and B are not absent, so allowed.

But O is already known, so we are testing M and B.

Now, Option C: L at 1, I at 5, O at 4 → pattern: L ? ? O I

Word: L _ _ O I

Like ""LOOBI"" not a word.

""LOTUS"" but T,U,S? S absent.

""LOCUS"" S absent.

""LOVAT"" not common.

""LOGIC"" but G,I,C? C absent and I at 5? ""LOGIC"" is L,O,G,I,C → C absent and positions: O at 2, not 4.

Not matching.

So ""LIMBO"" is a candidate.

Now, other cases.

L at 2: Option E: L at 2, O at 1, I at 5 → pattern: O L ? ? I

Word: O L _ _ I

Examples: ""OLIVE"" but V,E? E absent.

""OLIVI"" not a word.

""OLPHA"" not a word.

Not easy.

Option F: L at 2, O at 4, I at 1 → pattern: I L ? O ?

Word: I L _ O _

Like ""ILIUM"" but M,U? ""ILIUM"" is I,L,I,U,M? Not 5 distinct? And U and M.

But I repeated? ""ILIUM"" has two I's? Positions: I1, L2, I3, U4, M5? But we need O at 4, here U at 4.

Not.

""ILKDO"" not a word.

Option G: L at 2, O at 4, I at 5 → pattern: ? L ? O I

Word: _ L _ O I

Like ""ALOFT"" but A absent.

""BLOKI"" not a word.

""GLYPH"" but G,L,Y? Y absent.

Y is absent from guess 3.

Option H: L at 2, O at 5, I at 1 → pattern: I L ? ? O

Word: I L _ _ O

Like ""ILKDO"" no.

""IMAGE"" but M,A,G,E? A and E absent.

Not.

Now L at 3: Option J: L at 3, O at 1, I at 2 → pattern: O I L ? ?

Word: O I L _ _

Like ""OILED"" but E,D absent.

""OILER"" E absent.

""OILTY"" not a word.

Option K: L at 3, O at 1, I at 5 → pattern: O ? L ? I

Word: O _ L _ I

Like ""OWLFI"" no.

""OCTLI"" not a word.

Option L: L at 3, O at 4, I at 1 → pattern: I ? L O ?

Word: I _ L O _

Like ""IDOLA"" but D,A absent.

""IGLOO"" but G,O,O? O repeated, and we have I at 1, G at 2, L at 3, O at 4 and 5? But pattern: I _ L O _ , so position 5 is open.

""IGLOO"" is I,G,L,O,O → so positions: I1, G2, L3, O4, O5. So it matches the pattern I _ L O _ with the last being O.

But we have O at 4 and 5? But in the pattern, we have O at 4, and position 5 is filled with O, which is fine.

But we already considered ""IGLOO"" earlier? But in ""IGLOO"", L is at position 3, which is allowed? L can be at 3? Yes, from constraints.

O at 4: in ""spoil"" O was at 3 and wrong, so position 4 is new and allowed. In ""doily"" O was at 2 and wrong, so position 4 is not forbidden for O? O cannot be at 2 or 3, so 4 is okay.

I at 1: in ""spoil"" I was at 4 and wrong, in ""doily"" at 3 and wrong, so position 1 is allowed.

So ""IGLOO"" is a possible word.

But it has two O's? That's acceptable.

Letters: I,G,L,O,O. G is new and allowed.

But we already have O,I,L present, so we are testing G.

Now, back to ""LIMBO"" and ""IGLOO"".

We have two candidates: ""LIMBO"" and ""IGLOO"".

But in ""LIMBO"", we have M and B, two new letters.

In ""IGLOO"", we have G and an extra O.

But O is already known, so we get less new information? But we might confirm if there is a double O.

But we don't know.

Perhaps we can choose a word with more new letters.

Another option: Option M: L at 3, O at 4, I at 2 → pattern: ? I L O ?

Word: _ I L O _

Like ""WILCO"" not common.

""KILOS"" but S absent.

""TILTH"" T,H? ""TILTH"" is T,I,L,T,H? Not 5 distinct? T repeated.

""BILLY"" but Y absent and no O.

Not.

Option N: L at 3, O at 4, I at 5 → pattern: ? ? L O I

Word: _ _ L O I

Like ""BLOKI"" no.

""GLYCO"" not.

Option O: L at 3, O at 5, I at 1 → pattern: I ? L ? O

Word: I _ L _ O

Like ""IDOLO"" but D absent.

""IGLOO"" is I,G,L,O,O → but O at 4 and 5, not at 5 only? Pattern I _ L _ O would be I at1, ? at2, L at3, ? at4, O at5.

But in ""IGLOO"", it's I at1, G at2, L at3, O at4, O at5 → so position 4 is O, not the fifth? For the pattern I _ L _ O, we need O at position 5, but in ""IGLOO"" position 5 is O, but position 4 is also O, so it doesn't match the pattern exactly? The pattern requires a letter at position 4, but in ""IGLOO"" it's O, which is fine, but the pattern for Option O is I at1, ? at2, L at3, ? at4, O at5.

In ""IGLOO"", position 4 is O, which is not a new letter, but the pattern allows it? The pattern doesn't specify what is at 4, it can be O.

But in this case, for Option O, we have I at1, L at3, O at5, and positions 2 and 4 to fill.

In ""IGLOO"", position 2 is G and position 4 is O, so it fits if we consider position 4 as O, which is allowed.

But Option O is for L at3, O at5, I at1.

In ""IGLOO"", O is at5? Position 5 is O, yes. And O at4 is extra.

But the pattern is satisfied.

Similarly, Option P: L at3, O at5, I at2 → pattern: ? I L ? O

Word: _ I L _ O

Like ""FILMO"" not a word.

""WILCO"" not.

So the main candidates are ""LIMBO"" and ""IGLOO"".

Now, which one to choose?

""LIMBO"" tests two new letters: M and B.

""IGLOO"" tests one new letter: G, and might indicate if O is repeated.

But since we have limited guesses, testing more new letters might be better.

Also, ""LIMBO"" is a valid word.

Another word: what about ""MILKO""? Not common.

Or ""TOUCH"" but T,O,U,C,H? C absent.

Perhaps ""GUILD"" but U,I,L,D? D absent and no O.

D is absent.

Another possibility: Option from L at1, I at5, O at4: we didn't find a word.

But let's list all possible words we can think of with O,I,L and two new letters.

For example, ""OIL"" with extensions? Hard.

""FOUL"" but F,O,U,L? No I.

""JOINT"" but J,O,I,N,T? N absent.

""QUOIT"" Q,U,O,I,T? But Q and U, and T. N not present? ""QUOIT"" is a word, but let's see: Q,U,O,I,T.

Letters: Q,U,O,I,T. All not absent? Absent: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,D,Y. So Q,U,O,I,T are all allowed.

Now, positions: we need to place O,I,L? But ""QUOIT"" has O,I, but no L? L is required! We must have L in the word.

""QUOIT"" does not have L, so it cannot be, because L is present.

Similarly, ""BUOYS"" but S absent and no I,L.

We must include L.

Another word: ""BUILT"" but U,I,L,T? No O.

""OLLIE"" but O,L,L,I,E? E absent and double L.

Not.

""LOTUS"" S absent.

Perhaps ""LIMBO"" is the best so far.

""THOLI"" not common.

""VOTIVE"" 6 letters.

I think ""LIMBO"" is a good guess.

But let's confirm the positions in ""LIMBO"":

- L at position 1
- I at position 2
- M at position 3
- B at position 4
- O at position 5

Now, constraints:

For O: must not be at 2 or 3. Here at 5, which is allowed.

For I: must not be at 3 or 4. Here at 2, which is allowed.

For L: must not be at 4 or 5. Here at 1, which is allowed.

And M and B are new.

So it should be fine.

Similarly, ""IGLOO"": I at1, G at2, L at3, O at4, O at5.

O at4: allowed? O cannot be at 2 or 3, so 4 is new and allowed.

L at3: allowed? L cannot be at 4 or 5, so 3 is allowed.

I at1: allowed? I cannot be at 3 or 4, so 1 is allowed.

But O at5 is also present, but that's fine.

But in terms of information, ""LIMBO"" tests two new letters, so I prefer that.

We could also consider ""LOGIN"" but N absent.

So I'll go with ""LIMBO"".

But is ""LIMBO"" accepted? Yes.

So guess: ""LIMBO""

But in the feedback, we have to see.

Another word: ""BOWL"" not 5 letters.

""CLIMB"" C absent.

So ""LIMBO"" it is.

<guess>limbo</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Feedback from Previous Guesses**:
   - **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). These letters cannot be in the secret word.
   - **Guess 2 (""spoil"")**: 
     - S and P are absent (x), so they are also excluded.
     - O, I, L are present but misplaced (-). This means:
       - O is in the word, but not at position 3.
       - I is in the word, but not at position 4.
       - L is in the word, but not at position 5.
   - **Guess 3 (""doily"")**:
     - D and Y are absent (x), so they are excluded.
     - O, I, L are present but misplaced (-). This adds new constraints:
       - O is not at position 2 (since it was misplaced there in ""doily"").
       - I is not at position 3 (misplaced in ""doily"").
       - L is not at position 4 (misplaced in ""doily"").

2. **Deductions**:
   - **Absent Letters**: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, D, Y (9 letters excluded).
   - **Present Letters**: O, I, L must be in the secret word, but their positions are unknown. Constraints on their positions:
     - O: Cannot be at positions 2 or 3 → possible positions: 1, 4, or 5.
     - I: Cannot be at positions 3 or 4 → possible positions: 1, 2, or 5.
     - L: Cannot be at positions 4 or 5 → possible positions: 1, 2, or 3.
   - **Available Letters**: The secret word must include O, I, L, plus two new letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding absent letters). Remaining letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:
   - The new guess must:
     - Include O, I, and L (since they are confirmed present).
     - Place O, I, and L in positions that satisfy all constraints (e.g., O not at 2/3, I not at 3/4, L not at 4/5).
     - Use two new letters from the available set to maximize information.
     - Avoid all absent letters.
   - After evaluating possible words, **""LIMBO""** is a strong candidate because:
     - Letters: L, I, M, B, O.
       - O, I, L are included (required).
       - M and B are new, untested letters (from available set).
       - No absent letters are used.
     - Positions:
       - L at position 1: Allowed (L cannot be at 4/5, and position 1 is valid).
       - I at position 2: Allowed (I cannot be at 3/4, and position 2 is valid).
       - O at position 5: Allowed (O cannot be at 2/3, and position 5 is valid).
     - This tests new letters (M and B) while respecting all positional constraints for O, I, L.

4. **Why ""LIMBO""?**:
   - It is a valid 5-letter English word.
   - It adheres to all feedback constraints.
   - It maximizes new information by testing M and B, which could help identify more letters or positions in future guesses.
   - Alternatives like ""IGLOO"" were considered, but ""LIMBO"" is preferred for testing two new letters instead of one (G in ""IGLOO""), providing better coverage.",Guess 4: limbo -> FEEDBACK: L(-) I(-) M(x) B(x) O(✓),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"" which was all incorrect: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x). This means that none of these letters are in the secret word at all.
 Since none of the letters in ""crane"" appear in the secret word, we need to choose a new word that avoids all these letters.

 Letters to avoid: C, R, A, N, E.

 We should pick a word that uses other common vowels and consonants.

 Common vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out)
 Common consonants: We have many, such as S, T, L, P, M, B, D, G, H, K, etc.

 We want a word that has five new letters and is likely to give us more information.

 Considering words without C, R, A, N, E.

 A good candidate might be ""SPOIL"", but let's check for more common words.

 Another common starting word is ""SLOTH"", but note that O is a vowel.

 Alternatively, ""TOILS"" or ""TULIP"". However, we want to maximize coverage.

 Let's try to include I and O since they are common vowels.

 Possible words: 
   ""PIOUS"" - letters P, I, O, U, S
   ""FOULS"" - F, O, U, L, S
   ""STOMP"" - S, T, O, M, P

 But note: we also have U and sometimes Y (though less common). We don't know if the word has any vowels yet, so including multiple vowels is good.

 Considering the feedback, our next guess should avoid C,R,A,N,E entirely.

 I think ""SPOIL"" is a good choice: S, P, O, I, L. All these letters are common and distinct.

 Another option: ""BUILT"" has B, U, I, L, T.

 But let's pick one. We'll go with ""SPOIL"".

 So, second guess: ""spoil""

<guess>spoil</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked as not in the word (x), I need to choose a new word with **completely different letters**. Since none of these letters appear in the secret word, my next guess must avoid C, R, A, N, and E entirely.

For optimal information gain:
- Choose a word with common letters not yet tested, like S, T, O, L, I, P, M, B, or D.
- Prioritize vowels still available (O, I, U) and high-frequency consonants.
- Ensure all 5 letters are unique and valid.

A strong second guess is **""SPOIL""** because:
- Uses new common letters: S, P, O, I, L.
- Includes the vowels O and I.
- Tests 5 distinct, untried letters to maximize feedback.

<guess>spoil</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: spoil -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(-) I(-) L(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters (C,R,A,N,E) are absent (x). So the secret word has none of these letters.
2. ""spoil"" -> S(x), P(x), O(-), I(-), L(-)

Important: 
- O, I, L are in the word but in the WRONG position.
- S and P are absent.

Since O, I, L are present but misplaced, they must be in the secret word, but not in the positions they were guessed in ""spoil"". 

In ""spoil"":
- O is in position 3
- I is in position 4
- L is in position 5

So in the secret word:
- O cannot be at position 3
- I cannot be at position 4
- L cannot be at position 5

Additionally, we know from Guess 1 that the letters C,R,A,N,E are absent, and from Guess 2 that S and P are absent. So the set of absent letters now includes: C, R, A, N, E, S, P.

Available letters: All letters except C,R,A,N,E,S,P. Very important to avoid these.

We also know that O, I, L must appear somewhere in the word.

Since O, I, L are present, but we don't know their correct positions yet.

We need to make a new guess that:
1. Includes O, I, and L (since they are in the word) but in different positions than in ""spoil"".
   - Specifically, O not at position 3, I not at position 4, L not at position 5.
2. Does not contain any absent letters: C,R,A,N,E,S,P.
3. The other two letters should be new ones, from the remaining alphabet.

Let me list possible letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

But note: we have two open positions since O,I,L take three positions. So we need two more letters.

Also, the word must be a valid 5-letter English word.

We also have to consider that O, I, L can be anywhere else.

Idea: try to place O, I, L in positions where they are allowed and add two new letters.

Possible new positions for O: any of 1,2,4,5 (since not position 3)
Similarly, I: any of 1,2,3,5 (not 4)
L: any of 1,2,3,4 (not 5)

We can rearrange them arbitrarily as long as they are not in the forbidden positions.

But we have to form a valid word.

Also, we can use the fact that O and I are vowels, so probably the word has a vowel somewhere.

Let me try to think of words containing O, I, L and two other new letters.

Consider words ending with L? But remember, L cannot be at position 5, so perhaps L at 1,2,3, or 4.

Similarly, O cannot be at 3.

I am considering common words with O,I,L.

Possible words:
- Could it be ""OIL""? But that's only 3 letters, so we need a 5-letter word.

We need two more letters.

One idea: words like ""BUILD"", but that has U and I, and D. But note: U is not excluded. However, ""BUILD"" has B,U,I,L,D.

Check letters: B,U,I,L,D. None are in the excluded set? 
Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,S,P. So U and B and D are allowed.

But in ""BUILD"", I is at position 3 and L is at position 4? Let's spell:
- Position 1: B
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: L
- Position 5: D

But in our feedback for ""spoil"", I was at position 4 (which is incorrect), but that doesn't mean I cannot be at position 3? 
Wait: The feedback for I was at position 4 being wrong, but it could be at position 3? Yes, because that wasn't tested.

Similarly, L was at position 5 and was wrong, but could L be at position 4? Yes.

However, O is also in the word. In ""BUILD"", there is no O. So it would be missing O, but O must be in the word.

Therefore, any guess must include O, I, and L.

So ""BUILD"" doesn't have O, so it cannot work.

We need a word that contains O, I, L and two other non-excluded letters.

Let me list some possibilities:

- How about ""TOIL""? But that's 4 letters. Need 5 letters.
We can have ""TOILS"" but S is excluded (from feedback: S is absent). So no.

- ""BOILS"" - but S is absent and P? No, S is excluded.

S is excluded, so no words with S.

Similarly, no P.

What about ""MOUTH""? But that has M,O,U,T,H. It has O, but lacks I and L.

We need I and L too.

The word must have at least O,I,L.

That means it must contain those three, plus two more letters from the allowed set.

So let me focus: O, I, L plus two from: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Also, the positions must be such that O not at 3, I not at 4, L not at 5.

Therefore, let's try to construct:

Option: Place O at position 1? Then I and L elsewhere.

Words starting with O: what words start with O and have I and L?

For example: ""OILER"" - O,I,L,E? But E is excluded (from guess 1). E(x), so absent.

""OILED"" - E and D. Again E is excluded.

""OIL"" in different positions? 

How about ""OLDIE"": O, L, D, I, E. But E is excluded.

No E.

What about ""GUILT""? G, U, I, L, T. No O.

We need O.

Another idea: ""VOILA"" - V,O,I,L,A. But A is excluded (from guess 1: A(x)).

A is out.

""DOILY"" - D,O,I,L,Y. Letters: D,O,I,L,Y.

All these letters: D,O,I,L,Y are allowed? 
Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,S,P. So D,O,I,L,Y are all okay.

Now, positions in ""DOILY"":
- D at 1
- O at 2
- I at 3
- L at 4
- Y at 5

Now, check if the forbidden positions are avoided:
- O cannot be at position 3? In ""DOILY"", O is at 2, which is fine. (O not at 3: okay)
- I cannot be at position 4? In ""DOILY"", I is at 3, which is a different position. Fine.
- L cannot be at position 5? In ""DOILY"", L is at 4, not 5. Fine.

Also, we get two new letters: D and Y.

Valid English word? ""DOILY"" means a small ornamental mat, yes.

So let's consider ""DOILY"".

But note: In ""spoil"", O was at position 3 and marked wrong (-), meaning it is elsewhere. In ""DOILY"", O is at 2, which is different.

Similarly, I was at 4 in ""spoil"", now at 3 in ""DOILY"", which is different and allowed since the feedback only said position 4 was wrong for I.

L was at 5 in ""spoil"", now at 4 in ""DOILY"", different.

So this seems good.

Are there other possibilities?

Another word: ""MOULD"" - M,O,U,L,D. But lacks I? We need I too.

Must have I.

""KOJI"" is not 5 letters.

""LOGIN"" - but has L,O,G,I,N. But N is excluded (from guess 1: N(x)).

N is out.

""YOGIS"" - has Y,O,G,I,S, but S is excluded.

What about ""GHOUL""? G,H,O,U,L. But no I.

We need O,I,L all together.

""TOXIC"" - T,O,X,I,C. C is excluded.

""JOLLY"" - J,O,L,L,Y. But has double L? And no I? It has O,L,Y, but misses I.

I is mandatory.

""BILLY"" - B,I,L,L,Y. Double L? And O is missing? Have I and L, no O.

O is mandatory.

So ""DOILY"" seems a strong candidate.

Another possibility: ""BIOIL""? Not a word.

""LOUIE"" - L,O,U,I,E, but E is excluded.

""WIELD"" - W,I,E,L,D, E excluded and no O.

So it's challenging.

Perhaps ""DITTO"" - D,I,T,T,O. But it has duplicate T? And no L? L is mandatory.

We require L.

Another idea: ""IGLOO"" - I,G,L,O,O. Has O twice? Positions:
1. I
2. G
3. L
4. O
5. O

But check positions:
- O: In ""spoil"", O was at position 3. Now we have O at positions 4 and 5? But O must appear at least once, and not at position 3. Having O at other positions is fine.

But we have two O's? Possible? The feedback only said O is in the word and misplaced, but didn't say how many. So it could have multiple.

Similarly, I is at position 1: in ""spoil"" I was at position 4 and wrong. Position 1 is different.

L is at position 3: in ""spoil"" L was at position 5 and wrong. Position 3 is different? Yes.

Available letters: G is allowed? Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,S,P, so G is fine.

Word: ""IGLOO"" meaning an Inuit house? Or from video games? Valid word.

But we have duplicate O? That's okay as long as the word is valid.

However, we get feedback per letter? The feedback system might show both O's? But in rules, each letter is considered. But if the secret word has one O and our guess has O twice, it might cause issues? 

Recall the rules: each letter gets a symbol.

But secret word might have repeated letters? Yes, possible.

In our case, we don't know.

But let's compare ""IGLOO"" vs ""DOILY"":

""DOILY"" has distinct letters: D,O,I,L,Y
""IGLOO"" has I,G,L,O,O - so O repeated.

We have two unknowns: we need to cover more letters? 

With ""DOILY"" we test D and Y, which are new.

With ""IGLOO"" we test G and also test O twice? But since we know O is present, testing O might not give new information.

Moreover, I prefer distinct letters for maximum coverage, so ""DOILY"" is better.

Another word: ""GOLLY"" - G,O,L,L,Y - double L, no I? Inadequate.

""DOILY"" seems a good choice.

But let me confirm: is ""DOILY"" a valid 5-letter word?
Yes, as per dictionary: a small napkin.

So I'll go with ""DOILY"".

Alternative: ""BUOYL""? Not a word. Or ""QUOIN""? Q,U,O,I,N but N is excluded.

So ""DOILY"" it is.

Therefore, third guess: ""doily""

<guess>doily</guess>Based on the feedback:

- **First guess ""crane""**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x) in the secret word.  
- **Second guess ""spoil""**:  
  - S and P are absent (x).  
  - O, I, L are present but misplaced (-). O cannot be at position 3, I cannot be at position 4, and L cannot be at position 5 of the secret word.  

### Key Deductions:
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, E, S, P. These cannot appear in any guess.
- **Present letters**: O, I, L must appear in the secret word but in different positions than in ""spoil"".  
- **New letters needed**: The guess must include O, I, L and two new letters from the remaining alphabet (avoiding absent letters).  

### Choosing the Next Guess:
A strong candidate is **""DOILY""** (a valid 5-letter English word meaning a small ornamental mat). Here's why:  
1. **Includes O, I, L**: Confirms their presence while testing new positions:
   - O is placed at position 2 (not 3).
   - I is placed at position 3 (not 4).
   - L is placed at position 4 (not 5).  
2. **New letter coverage**: Adds D and Y, both not previously tested and not absent.  
3. **Avoids conflicts**: Uses no excluded letters (C,R,A,N,E,S,P).

<guess>doily</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: spoil -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(-) I(-) L(-)
Guess 3: doily -> FEEDBACK: D(x) O(-) I(-) L(-) Y(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x) → All absent. So the secret word has none of these letters.

Guess 2: ""spoil"" -> S(x), P(x), O(-), I(-), L(-) → S and P are absent. O, I, L are present but in the wrong positions.

From this, we know:
- O is in the word, but not at position 3.
- I is in the word, but not at position 4.
- L is in the word, but not at position 5.

Guess 3: ""doily"" -> D(x), O(-), I(-), L(-), Y(x) → D and Y are absent. O, I, L are present but in the wrong positions.

Now, for O, I, L in ""doily"":
- O is at position 2 → feedback is (-), so O is not at position 2 in the secret word.
- I is at position 3 → (-), so not at position 3.
- L is at position 4 → (-), so not at position 4.

We also have new absent letters: D and Y.

So now, the full set of absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, D, Y.

Present letters: O, I, L (each must be in the word, but we don't know the positions).

We have three known present letters: O, I, L. They must be in the word, but we have constraints on their positions:

From ""spoil"":
- O not at pos 3
- I not at pos 4
- L not at pos 5

From ""doily"":
- O not at pos 2
- I not at pos 3
- L not at pos 4

Combining the constraints for each:

For O: cannot be at pos 2 (from doily) or pos 3 (from spoil). So possible positions: 1, 4, 5.

For I: cannot be at pos 4 (spoil) or pos 3 (doily). So possible positions: 1, 2, 5.

For L: cannot be at pos 5 (spoil) or pos 4 (doily). So possible positions: 1, 2, 3.

We need to form a 5-letter word that includes O, I, L and two other letters that are not in the absent set.

Available letters (consonants and vowels): 
Absent: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,D,Y → so we avoid these.

Remaining letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z

We also have to consider that the word must be a valid English word.

We have three positions to fill: the word has 5 letters, and we have O, I, L to place in three of them, but we need to choose positions that satisfy the constraints, and the other two letters from the available set.

Since we have three fixed letters, we need to choose two more and arrange all.

We can think of the positions:

Let me denote the positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

Constraints:
- O: can be at 1,4,5
- I: can be at 1,2,5
- L: can be at 1,2,3

But note: each position can have only one letter, and we must assign each of O, I, L to a position that is allowed for it, and the other two positions with new letters.

We also need to avoid the absent letters.

Now, we must cover all five positions.

Let me try to find a word that fits.

First, consider possible positions for L: 1,2,3.

Case 1: L at position 1.
Then, for O: can be at 4 or 5 (since 1 is taken, and O cannot be at 2 or 3).
For I: can be at 2,5 (since 1 is taken, and I cannot be at 3 or 4? Wait, I cannot be at 3 or 4, but 3 is available? I can be at 2 or 5.

If L at 1:
- Position 1: L
- Then O must be at 4 or 5.
- I must be at 2 or 5.

But if O is at 5 and I at 2, that works. Or O at 4 and I at 2, or O at 4 and I at 5, or O at 5 and I at 2? Let's list:

Option A: L at 1, I at 2, O at 4 → then positions 3 and 5 need to be filled.
Option B: L at 1, I at 2, O at 5 → positions 3 and 4.
Option C: L at 1, I at 5, O at 4 → positions 2 and 3.
Option D: L at 1, I at 5, O at 5 → conflict, position 5 cannot have two letters.

So possible: A, B, C.

Similarly, if L at 2:
- L at 2.
- O can be at 1,4,5 (but 2 taken, so 1,4,5)
- I can be at 1,5 (since 2 taken, and cannot be at 3 or 4? I cannot be at 3 or 4, so only 1 or 5? But position 2 is taken, so I at 1 or 5.

So:
Option E: L at 2, O at 1, I at 5 → positions 3 and 4.
Option F: L at 2, O at 4, I at 1 → positions 3 and 5.
Option G: L at 2, O at 4, I at 5 → positions 1 and 3.
Option H: L at 2, O at 5, I at 1 → positions 3 and 4? O at 5, I at 1: positions 3 and 4 open.
Option I: L at 2, O at 5, I at 5 → conflict.

And if L at 3:
- L at 3.
- O can be at 1,4,5 (3 taken, so 1,4,5)
- I can be at 1,2,5 (3 taken, so 1,2,5)

So:
Option J: L at 3, O at 1, I at 2 → positions 4 and 5.
Option K: L at 3, O at 1, I at 5 → positions 2 and 4.
Option L: L at 3, O at 4, I at 1 → positions 2 and 5.
Option M: L at 3, O at 4, I at 2 → positions 1 and 5.
Option N: L at 3, O at 4, I at 5 → positions 1 and 2.
Option O: L at 3, O at 5, I at 1 → positions 2 and 4.
Option P: L at 3, O at 5, I at 2 → positions 1 and 4.
Option Q: L at 3, O at 5, I at 5 → conflict.

Now, we need to fill the remaining positions with letters from the available set: B,F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Z.

And form a valid word.

We also have to consider that in the feedback, for ""doily"", O, I, L were all misplaced, so in the new word, they must be in different positions.

Now, let's try to find a word that matches one of these patterns.

Start with L at position 1: Option A: L at 1, I at 2, O at 4 → positions 3 and 5 to fill.

So pattern: L I ? O ?

We need a word: L I _ O _

With the blank positions 3 and 5 filled with letters not absent.

Possible words? Like ""LIGHT"" but G and H, but ""LIGHT"" has I at 2, O? No, ""LIGHT"" is L,I,G,H,T → no O.

""LIMBO"" - L,I,M,B,O → but O is at position 5, not 4. We need O at 4.

In this pattern, O must be at 4.

So ""L I ? O ?"" → position 4 is O.

What words start with ""LI"" and have O at position 4? And 5th letter.

For example, ""LILIO"" not a word.

""LINGO"" but N is absent.

""LIVID"" but V and D, D is absent.

""LIBRO"" but B,R,O? R is absent.

R is absent? From guess 1, R(x), so absent.

Available: B,F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Z

""LITIO"" not a word.

""LIKEO"" not a word.

""LIMO"" is 4 letters.

""LITHO"" - L,I,T,H,O → positions: L1, I2, T3, H4, O5 → but we need O at position 4? Here O is at 5.

Not matching.

Perhaps no common word for this pattern.

Option B: L at 1, I at 2, O at 5 → pattern: L I ? ? O

So word: L I _ _ O

Examples: ""LINGO"" but N absent.

""LITMO"" not a word.

""LIVID"" but D absent.

""LIGHT"" no O.

""LIMBO"" - L,I,M,B,O → that's L1,I2,M3,B4,O5 → so O at 5, which matches. And M and B are allowed? M and B not absent.

""LIMBO"" is a word.

But check constraints: O at position 5? In ""spoil"", O was at 3 and wrong, and in ""doily"" O at 2 and wrong, but position 5 is allowed for O? Yes, from above O can be at 5.

I at position 2: in ""spoil"" I was at 4 and wrong, in ""doily"" at 3 and wrong, position 2 is allowed for I? Yes, I can be at 2.

L at position 1: in ""spoil"" L was at 5 and wrong, in ""doily"" at 4 and wrong, position 1 is allowed for L? Yes.

So ""LIMBO"" seems possible.

But we have to check if it uses only allowed letters: L,I,M,B,O. M and B are not absent, so allowed.

But O is already known, so we are testing M and B.

Now, Option C: L at 1, I at 5, O at 4 → pattern: L ? ? O I

Word: L _ _ O I

Like ""LOOBI"" not a word.

""LOTUS"" but T,U,S? S absent.

""LOCUS"" S absent.

""LOVAT"" not common.

""LOGIC"" but G,I,C? C absent and I at 5? ""LOGIC"" is L,O,G,I,C → C absent and positions: O at 2, not 4.

Not matching.

So ""LIMBO"" is a candidate.

Now, other cases.

L at 2: Option E: L at 2, O at 1, I at 5 → pattern: O L ? ? I

Word: O L _ _ I

Examples: ""OLIVE"" but V,E? E absent.

""OLIVI"" not a word.

""OLPHA"" not a word.

Not easy.

Option F: L at 2, O at 4, I at 1 → pattern: I L ? O ?

Word: I L _ O _

Like ""ILIUM"" but M,U? ""ILIUM"" is I,L,I,U,M? Not 5 distinct? And U and M.

But I repeated? ""ILIUM"" has two I's? Positions: I1, L2, I3, U4, M5? But we need O at 4, here U at 4.

Not.

""ILKDO"" not a word.

Option G: L at 2, O at 4, I at 5 → pattern: ? L ? O I

Word: _ L _ O I

Like ""ALOFT"" but A absent.

""BLOKI"" not a word.

""GLYPH"" but G,L,Y? Y absent.

Y is absent from guess 3.

Option H: L at 2, O at 5, I at 1 → pattern: I L ? ? O

Word: I L _ _ O

Like ""ILKDO"" no.

""IMAGE"" but M,A,G,E? A and E absent.

Not.

Now L at 3: Option J: L at 3, O at 1, I at 2 → pattern: O I L ? ?

Word: O I L _ _

Like ""OILED"" but E,D absent.

""OILER"" E absent.

""OILTY"" not a word.

Option K: L at 3, O at 1, I at 5 → pattern: O ? L ? I

Word: O _ L _ I

Like ""OWLFI"" no.

""OCTLI"" not a word.

Option L: L at 3, O at 4, I at 1 → pattern: I ? L O ?

Word: I _ L O _

Like ""IDOLA"" but D,A absent.

""IGLOO"" but G,O,O? O repeated, and we have I at 1, G at 2, L at 3, O at 4 and 5? But pattern: I _ L O _ , so position 5 is open.

""IGLOO"" is I,G,L,O,O → so positions: I1, G2, L3, O4, O5. So it matches the pattern I _ L O _ with the last being O.

But we have O at 4 and 5? But in the pattern, we have O at 4, and position 5 is filled with O, which is fine.

But we already considered ""IGLOO"" earlier? But in ""IGLOO"", L is at position 3, which is allowed? L can be at 3? Yes, from constraints.

O at 4: in ""spoil"" O was at 3 and wrong, so position 4 is new and allowed. In ""doily"" O was at 2 and wrong, so position 4 is not forbidden for O? O cannot be at 2 or 3, so 4 is okay.

I at 1: in ""spoil"" I was at 4 and wrong, in ""doily"" at 3 and wrong, so position 1 is allowed.

So ""IGLOO"" is a possible word.

But it has two O's? That's acceptable.

Letters: I,G,L,O,O. G is new and allowed.

But we already have O,I,L present, so we are testing G.

Now, back to ""LIMBO"" and ""IGLOO"".

We have two candidates: ""LIMBO"" and ""IGLOO"".

But in ""LIMBO"", we have M and B, two new letters.

In ""IGLOO"", we have G and an extra O.

But O is already known, so we get less new information? But we might confirm if there is a double O.

But we don't know.

Perhaps we can choose a word with more new letters.

Another option: Option M: L at 3, O at 4, I at 2 → pattern: ? I L O ?

Word: _ I L O _

Like ""WILCO"" not common.

""KILOS"" but S absent.

""TILTH"" T,H? ""TILTH"" is T,I,L,T,H? Not 5 distinct? T repeated.

""BILLY"" but Y absent and no O.

Not.

Option N: L at 3, O at 4, I at 5 → pattern: ? ? L O I

Word: _ _ L O I

Like ""BLOKI"" no.

""GLYCO"" not.

Option O: L at 3, O at 5, I at 1 → pattern: I ? L ? O

Word: I _ L _ O

Like ""IDOLO"" but D absent.

""IGLOO"" is I,G,L,O,O → but O at 4 and 5, not at 5 only? Pattern I _ L _ O would be I at1, ? at2, L at3, ? at4, O at5.

But in ""IGLOO"", it's I at1, G at2, L at3, O at4, O at5 → so position 4 is O, not the fifth? For the pattern I _ L _ O, we need O at position 5, but in ""IGLOO"" position 5 is O, but position 4 is also O, so it doesn't match the pattern exactly? The pattern requires a letter at position 4, but in ""IGLOO"" it's O, which is fine, but the pattern for Option O is I at1, ? at2, L at3, ? at4, O at5.

In ""IGLOO"", position 4 is O, which is not a new letter, but the pattern allows it? The pattern doesn't specify what is at 4, it can be O.

But in this case, for Option O, we have I at1, L at3, O at5, and positions 2 and 4 to fill.

In ""IGLOO"", position 2 is G and position 4 is O, so it fits if we consider position 4 as O, which is allowed.

But Option O is for L at3, O at5, I at1.

In ""IGLOO"", O is at5? Position 5 is O, yes. And O at4 is extra.

But the pattern is satisfied.

Similarly, Option P: L at3, O at5, I at2 → pattern: ? I L ? O

Word: _ I L _ O

Like ""FILMO"" not a word.

""WILCO"" not.

So the main candidates are ""LIMBO"" and ""IGLOO"".

Now, which one to choose?

""LIMBO"" tests two new letters: M and B.

""IGLOO"" tests one new letter: G, and might indicate if O is repeated.

But since we have limited guesses, testing more new letters might be better.

Also, ""LIMBO"" is a valid word.

Another word: what about ""MILKO""? Not common.

Or ""TOUCH"" but T,O,U,C,H? C absent.

Perhaps ""GUILD"" but U,I,L,D? D absent and no O.

D is absent.

Another possibility: Option from L at1, I at5, O at4: we didn't find a word.

But let's list all possible words we can think of with O,I,L and two new letters.

For example, ""OIL"" with extensions? Hard.

""FOUL"" but F,O,U,L? No I.

""JOINT"" but J,O,I,N,T? N absent.

""QUOIT"" Q,U,O,I,T? But Q and U, and T. N not present? ""QUOIT"" is a word, but let's see: Q,U,O,I,T.

Letters: Q,U,O,I,T. All not absent? Absent: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,D,Y. So Q,U,O,I,T are all allowed.

Now, positions: we need to place O,I,L? But ""QUOIT"" has O,I, but no L? L is required! We must have L in the word.

""QUOIT"" does not have L, so it cannot be, because L is present.

Similarly, ""BUOYS"" but S absent and no I,L.

We must include L.

Another word: ""BUILT"" but U,I,L,T? No O.

""OLLIE"" but O,L,L,I,E? E absent and double L.

Not.

""LOTUS"" S absent.

Perhaps ""LIMBO"" is the best so far.

""THOLI"" not common.

""VOTIVE"" 6 letters.

I think ""LIMBO"" is a good guess.

But let's confirm the positions in ""LIMBO"":

- L at position 1
- I at position 2
- M at position 3
- B at position 4
- O at position 5

Now, constraints:

For O: must not be at 2 or 3. Here at 5, which is allowed.

For I: must not be at 3 or 4. Here at 2, which is allowed.

For L: must not be at 4 or 5. Here at 1, which is allowed.

And M and B are new.

So it should be fine.

Similarly, ""IGLOO"": I at1, G at2, L at3, O at4, O at5.

O at4: allowed? O cannot be at 2 or 3, so 4 is new and allowed.

L at3: allowed? L cannot be at 4 or 5, so 3 is allowed.

I at1: allowed? I cannot be at 3 or 4, so 1 is allowed.

But O at5 is also present, but that's fine.

But in terms of information, ""LIMBO"" tests two new letters, so I prefer that.

We could also consider ""LOGIN"" but N absent.

So I'll go with ""LIMBO"".

But is ""LIMBO"" accepted? Yes.

So guess: ""LIMBO""

But in the feedback, we have to see.

Another word: ""BOWL"" not 5 letters.

""CLIMB"" C absent.

So ""LIMBO"" it is.

<guess>limbo</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Feedback from Previous Guesses**:
   - **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). These letters cannot be in the secret word.
   - **Guess 2 (""spoil"")**: 
     - S and P are absent (x), so they are also excluded.
     - O, I, L are present but misplaced (-). This means:
       - O is in the word, but not at position 3.
       - I is in the word, but not at position 4.
       - L is in the word, but not at position 5.
   - **Guess 3 (""doily"")**:
     - D and Y are absent (x), so they are excluded.
     - O, I, L are present but misplaced (-). This adds new constraints:
       - O is not at position 2 (since it was misplaced there in ""doily"").
       - I is not at position 3 (misplaced in ""doily"").
       - L is not at position 4 (misplaced in ""doily"").

2. **Deductions**:
   - **Absent Letters**: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, D, Y (9 letters excluded).
   - **Present Letters**: O, I, L must be in the secret word, but their positions are unknown. Constraints on their positions:
     - O: Cannot be at positions 2 or 3 → possible positions: 1, 4, or 5.
     - I: Cannot be at positions 3 or 4 → possible positions: 1, 2, or 5.
     - L: Cannot be at positions 4 or 5 → possible positions: 1, 2, or 3.
   - **Available Letters**: The secret word must include O, I, L, plus two new letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding absent letters). Remaining letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:
   - The new guess must:
     - Include O, I, and L (since they are confirmed present).
     - Place O, I, and L in positions that satisfy all constraints (e.g., O not at 2/3, I not at 3/4, L not at 4/5).
     - Use two new letters from the available set to maximize information.
     - Avoid all absent letters.
   - After evaluating possible words, **""LIMBO""** is a strong candidate because:
     - Letters: L, I, M, B, O.
       - O, I, L are included (required).
       - M and B are new, untested letters (from available set).
       - No absent letters are used.
     - Positions:
       - L at position 1: Allowed (L cannot be at 4/5, and position 1 is valid).
       - I at position 2: Allowed (I cannot be at 3/4, and position 2 is valid).
       - O at position 5: Allowed (O cannot be at 2/3, and position 5 is valid).
     - This tests new letters (M and B) while respecting all positional constraints for O, I, L.

4. **Why ""LIMBO""?**:
   - It is a valid 5-letter English word.
   - It adheres to all feedback constraints.
   - It maximizes new information by testing M and B, which could help identify more letters or positions in future guesses.
   - Alternatives like ""IGLOO"" were considered, but ""LIMBO"" is preferred for testing two new letters instead of one (G in ""IGLOO""), providing better coverage.

Since none of these letters appear in the secret word, my next guess must avoid C, R, A, N, and E entirely.\n\nFor optimal information gain:\n- Choose a word with common letters not yet tested, like S, T, O, L, I, P, M, B, or D.\n- Prioritize vowels still available (O, I, U) and high-frequency consonants.\n- Ensure all 5 letters are unique and valid.\n\nA strong second guess is **""SPOIL""** because:\n- Uses new common letters: S, P, O, I, L.\n- Includes the vowels O and I.\n- Tests 5 distinct, untried letters to maximize feedback.\n\n<guess>spoil</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: spoil -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(-) I(-) L(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n1. ""crane"" -> all letters (C,R,A,N,E) are absent (x). So the secret word has none of these letters.\n2. ""spoil"" -> S(x), P(x), O(-), I(-), L(-)\n\nImportant: \n- O, I, L are in the word but in the WRONG position.\n- S and P are absent.\n\nSince O, I, L are present but misplaced, they must be in the secret word, but not in the positions they were guessed in ""spoil"". \n\nIn ""spoil"":\n- O is in position 3\n- I is in position 4\n- L is in position 5\n\nSo in the secret word:\n- O cannot be at position 3\n- I cannot be at position 4\n- L cannot be at position 5\n\nAdditionally, we know from Guess 1 that the letters C,R,A,N,E are absent, and from Guess 2 that S and P are absent. So the set of absent letters now includes: C, R, A, N, E, S, P.\n\nAvailable letters: All letters except C,R,A,N,E,S,P. Very important to avoid these.\n\nWe also know that O, I, L must appear somewhere in the word.\n\nSince O, I, L are present, but we don\'t know their correct positions yet.\n\nWe need to make a new guess that:\n1. Includes O, I, and L (since they are in the word) but in different positions than in ""spoil"".\n   - Specifically, O not at position 3, I not at position 4, L not at position 5.\n2. Does not contain any absent letters: C,R,A,N,E,S,P.\n3. The other two letters should be new ones, from the remaining alphabet.\n\nLet me list possible letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nBut note: we have two open positions since O,I,L take three positions. So we need two more letters.\n\nAlso, the word must be a valid 5-letter English word.\n\nWe also have to consider that O, I, L can be anywhere else.\n\nIdea: try to place O, I, L in positions where they are allowed and add two new letters.\n\nPossible new positions for O: any of 1,2,4,5 (since not position 3)\nSimilarly, I: any of 1,2,3,5 (not 4)\nL: any of 1,2,3,4 (not 5)\n\nWe can rearrange them arbitrarily as long as they are not in the forbidden positions.\n\nBut we have to form a valid word.\n\nAlso, we can use the fact that O and I are vowels, so probably the word has a vowel somewhere.\n\nLet me try to think of words containing O, I, L and two other new letters.\n\nConsider words ending with L? But remember, L cannot be at position 5, so perhaps L at 1,2,3, or 4.\n\nSimilarly, O cannot be at 3.\n\nI am considering common words with O,I,L.\n\nPossible words:\n- Could it be ""OIL""? But that\'s only 3 letters, so we need a 5-letter word.\n\nWe need two more letters.\n\nOne idea: words like ""BUILD"", but that has U and I, and D. But note: U is not excluded. However, ""BUILD"" has B,U,I,L,D.\n\nCheck letters: B,U,I,L,D. None are in the excluded set? \nExcluded: C,R,A,N,E,S,P. So U and B and D are allowed.\n\nBut in ""BUILD"", I is at position 3 and L is at position 4? Let\'s spell:\n- Position 1: B\n- Position 2: U\n- Position 3: I\n- Position 4: L\n- Position 5: D\n\nBut in our feedback for ""spoil"", I was at position 4 (which is incorrect), but that doesn\'t mean I cannot be at position 3? \nWait: The feedback for I was at position 4 being wrong, but it could be at position 3? Yes, because that wasn\'t tested.\n\nSimilarly, L was at position 5 and was wrong, but could L be at position 4? Yes.\n\nHowever, O is also in the word. In ""BUILD"", there is no O. So it would be missing O, but O must be in the word.\n\nTherefore, any guess must include O, I, and L.\n\nSo ""BUILD"" doesn\'t have O, so it cannot work.\n\nWe need a word that contains O, I, L and two other non-excluded letters.\n\nLet me list some possibilities:\n\n- How about ""TOIL""? But that\'s 4 letters. Need 5 letters.\nWe can have ""TOILS"" but S is excluded (from feedback: S is absent). So no.\n\n- ""BOILS"" - but S is absent and P? No, S is excluded.\n\nS is excluded, so no words with S.\n\nSimilarly, no P.\n\nWhat about ""MOUTH""? But that has M,O,U,T,H. It has O, but lacks I and L.\n\nWe need I and L too.\n\nThe word must have at least O,I,L.\n\nThat means it must contain those three, plus two more letters from the allowed set.\n\nSo let me focus: O, I, L plus two from: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nAlso, the positions must be such that O not at 3, I not at 4, L not at 5.\n\nTherefore, let\'s try to construct:\n\nOption: Place O at position 1? Then I and L elsewhere.\n\nWords starting with O: what words start with O and have I and L?\n\nFor example: ""OILER"" - O,I,L,E? But E is excluded (from guess 1). E(x), so absent.\n\n""OILED"" - E and D. Again E is excluded.\n\n""OIL"" in different positions? \n\nHow about ""OLDIE"": O, L, D, I, E. But E is excluded.\n\nNo E.\n\nWhat about ""GUILT""? G, U, I, L, T. No O.\n\nWe need O.\n\nAnother idea: ""VOILA"" - V,O,I,L,A. But A is excluded (from guess 1: A(x)).\n\nA is out.\n\n""DOILY"" - D,O,I,L,Y. Letters: D,O,I,L,Y.\n\nAll these letters: D,O,I,L,Y are allowed? \nExcluded: C,R,A,N,E,S,P. So D,O,I,L,Y are all okay.\n\nNow, positions in ""DOILY"":\n- D at 1\n- O at 2\n- I at 3\n- L at 4\n- Y at 5\n\nNow, check if the forbidden positions are avoided:\n- O cannot be at position 3? In ""DOILY"", O is at 2, which is fine. (O not at 3: okay)\n- I cannot be at position 4? In ""DOILY"", I is at 3, which is a different position. Fine.\n- L cannot be at position 5? In ""DOILY"", L is at 4, not 5. Fine.\n\nAlso, we get two new letters: D and Y.\n\nValid English word? ""DOILY"" means a small ornamental mat, yes.\n\nSo let\'s consider ""DOILY"".\n\nBut note: In ""spoil"", O was at position 3 and marked wrong (-), meaning it is elsewhere. In ""DOILY"", O is at 2, which is different.\n\nSimilarly, I was at 4 in ""spoil"", now at 3 in ""DOILY"", which is different and allowed since the feedback only said position 4 was wrong for I.\n\nL was at 5 in ""spoil"", now at 4 in ""DOILY"", different.\n\nSo this seems good.\n\nAre there other possibilities?\n\nAnother word: ""MOULD"" - M,O,U,L,D. But lacks I? We need I too.\n\nMust have I.\n\n""KOJI"" is not 5 letters.\n\n""LOGIN"" - but has L,O,G,I,N. But N is excluded (from guess 1: N(x)).\n\nN is out.\n\n""YOGIS"" - has Y,O,G,I,S, but S is excluded.\n\nWhat about ""GHOUL""? G,H,O,U,L. But no I.\n\nWe need O,I,L all together.\n\n""TOXIC"" - T,O,X,I,C. C is excluded.\n\n""JOLLY"" - J,O,L,L,Y. But has double L? And no I? It has O,L,Y, but misses I.\n\nI is mandatory.\n\n""BILLY"" - B,I,L,L,Y. Double L? And O is missing? Have I and L, no O.\n\nO is mandatory.\n\nSo ""DOILY"" seems a strong candidate.\n\nAnother possibility: ""BIOIL""? Not a word.\n\n""LOUIE"" - L,O,U,I,E, but E is excluded.\n\n""WIELD"" - W,I,E,L,D, E excluded and no O.\n\nSo it\'s challenging.\n\nPerhaps ""DITTO"" - D,I,T,T,O. But it has duplicate T? And no L? L is mandatory.\n\nWe require L.\n\nAnother idea: ""IGLOO"" - I,G,L,O,O. Has O twice? Positions:\n1. I\n2. G\n3. L\n4. O\n5. O\n\nBut check positions:\n- O: In ""spoil"", O was at position 3. Now we have O at positions 4 and 5? But O must appear at least once, and not at position 3. Having O at other positions is fine.\n\nBut we have two O\'s? Possible? The feedback only said O is in the word and misplaced, but didn\'t say how many. So it could have multiple.\n\nSimilarly, I is at position 1: in ""spoil"" I was at position 4 and wrong. Position 1 is different.\n\nL is at position 3: in ""spoil"" L was at position 5 and wrong. Position 3 is different? Yes.\n\nAvailable letters: G is allowed? Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,S,P, so G is fine.\n\nWord: ""IGLOO"" meaning an Inuit house? Or from video games? Valid word.\n\nBut we have duplicate O? That\'s okay as long as the word is valid.\n\nHowever, we get feedback per letter? The feedback system might show both O\'s? But in rules, each letter is considered. But if the secret word has one O and our guess has O twice, it might cause issues? \n\nRecall the rules: each letter gets a symbol.\n\nBut secret word might have repeated letters? Yes, possible.\n\nIn our case, we don\'t know.\n\nBut let\'s compare ""IGLOO"" vs ""DOILY"":\n\n""DOILY"" has distinct letters: D,O,I,L,Y\n""IGLOO"" has I,G,L,O,O - so O repeated.\n\nWe have two unknowns: we need to cover more letters? \n\nWith ""DOILY"" we test D and Y, which are new.\n\nWith ""IGLOO"" we test G and also test O twice? But since we know O is present, testing O might not give new information.\n\nMoreover, I prefer distinct letters for maximum coverage, so ""DOILY"" is better.\n\nAnother word: ""GOLLY"" - G,O,L,L,Y - double L, no I? Inadequate.\n\n""DOILY"" seems a good choice.\n\nBut let me confirm: is ""DOILY"" a valid 5-letter word?\nYes, as per dictionary: a small napkin.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""DOILY"".\n\nAlternative: ""BUOYL""? Not a word. Or ""QUOIN""? Q,U,O,I,N but N is excluded.\n\nSo ""DOILY"" it is.\n\nTherefore, third guess: ""doily""\n\n<guess>doily</guess>Based on the feedback:\n\n- **First guess ""crane""**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x) in the secret word.  \n- **Second guess ""spoil""**:  \n  - S and P are absent (x).  \n  - O, I, L are present but misplaced (-). O cannot be at position 3, I cannot be at position 4, and L cannot be at position 5 of the secret word.  \n\n### Key Deductions:\n- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, E, S, P. These cannot appear in any guess.\n- **Present letters**: O, I, L must appear in the secret word but in different positions than in ""spoil"".  \n- **New letters needed**: The guess must include O, I, L and two new letters from the remaining alphabet (avoiding absent letters).  \n\n### Choosing the Next Guess:\nA strong candidate is **""DOILY""** (a valid 5-letter English word meaning a small ornamental mat). Here\'s why:  \n1. **Includes O, I, L**: Confirms their presence while testing new positions:\n   - O is placed at position 2 (not 3).\n   - I is placed at position 3 (not 4).\n   - L is placed at position 4 (not 5).  \n2. **New letter coverage**: Adds D and Y, both not previously tested and not absent.  \n3. **Avoids conflicts**: Uses no excluded letters (C,R,A,N,E,S,P).\n\n<guess>doily</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: spoil -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(-) I(-) L(-)\nGuess 3: doily -> FEEDBACK: D(x) O(-) I(-) L(-) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x) → All absent. So the secret word has none of these letters.\n\nGuess 2: ""spoil"" -> S(x), P(x), O(-), I(-), L(-) → S and P are absent. O, I, L are present but in the wrong positions.\n\nFrom this, we know:\n- O is in the word, but not at position 3.\n- I is in the word, but not at position 4.\n- L is in the word, but not at position 5.\n\nGuess 3: ""doily"" -> D(x), O(-), I(-), L(-), Y(x) → D and Y are absent. O, I, L are present but in the wrong positions.\n\nNow, for O, I, L in ""doily"":\n- O is at position 2 → feedback is (-), so O is not at position 2 in the secret word.\n- I is at position 3 → (-), so not at position 3.\n- L is at position 4 → (-), so not at position 4.\n\nWe also have new absent letters: D and Y.\n\nSo now, the full set of absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, D, Y.\n\nPresent letters: O, I, L (each must be in the word, but we don\'t know the positions).\n\nWe have three known present letters: O, I, L. They must be in the word, but we have constraints on their positions:\n\nFrom ""spoil"":\n- O not at pos 3\n- I not at pos 4\n- L not at pos 5\n\nFrom ""doily"":\n- O not at pos 2\n- I not at pos 3\n- L not at pos 4\n\nCombining the constraints for each:\n\nFor O: cannot be at pos 2 (from doily) or pos 3 (from spoil). So possible positions: 1, 4, 5.\n\nFor I: cannot be at pos 4 (spoil) or pos 3 (doily). So possible positions: 1, 2, 5.\n\nFor L: cannot be at pos 5 (spoil) or pos 4 (doily). So possible positions: 1, 2, 3.\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that includes O, I, L and two other letters that are not in the absent set.\n\nAvailable letters (consonants and vowels): \nAbsent: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,D,Y → so we avoid these.\n\nRemaining letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z\n\nWe also have to consider that the word must be a valid English word.\n\nWe have three positions to fill: the word has 5 letters, and we have O, I, L to place in three of them, but we need to choose positions that satisfy the constraints, and the other two letters from the available set.\n\nSince we have three fixed letters, we need to choose two more and arrange all.\n\nWe can think of the positions:\n\nLet me denote the positions: 1,2,3,4,5.\n\nConstraints:\n- O: can be at 1,4,5\n- I: can be at 1,2,5\n- L: can be at 1,2,3\n\nBut note: each position can have only one letter, and we must assign each of O, I, L to a position that is allowed for it, and the other two positions with new letters.\n\nWe also need to avoid the absent letters.\n\nNow, we must cover all five positions.\n\nLet me try to find a word that fits.\n\nFirst, consider possible positions for L: 1,2,3.\n\nCase 1: L at position 1.\nThen, for O: can be at 4 or 5 (since 1 is taken, and O cannot be at 2 or 3).\nFor I: can be at 2,5 (since 1 is taken, and I cannot be at 3 or 4? Wait, I cannot be at 3 or 4, but 3 is available? I can be at 2 or 5.\n\nIf L at 1:\n- Position 1: L\n- Then O must be at 4 or 5.\n- I must be at 2 or 5.\n\nBut if O is at 5 and I at 2, that works. Or O at 4 and I at 2, or O at 4 and I at 5, or O at 5 and I at 2? Let\'s list:\n\nOption A: L at 1, I at 2, O at 4 → then positions 3 and 5 need to be filled.\nOption B: L at 1, I at 2, O at 5 → positions 3 and 4.\nOption C: L at 1, I at 5, O at 4 → positions 2 and 3.\nOption D: L at 1, I at 5, O at 5 → conflict, position 5 cannot have two letters.\n\nSo possible: A, B, C.\n\nSimilarly, if L at 2:\n- L at 2.\n- O can be at 1,4,5 (but 2 taken, so 1,4,5)\n- I can be at 1,5 (since 2 taken, and cannot be at 3 or 4? I cannot be at 3 or 4, so only 1 or 5? But position 2 is taken, so I at 1 or 5.\n\nSo:\nOption E: L at 2, O at 1, I at 5 → positions 3 and 4.\nOption F: L at 2, O at 4, I at 1 → positions 3 and 5.\nOption G: L at 2, O at 4, I at 5 → positions 1 and 3.\nOption H: L at 2, O at 5, I at 1 → positions 3 and 4? O at 5, I at 1: positions 3 and 4 open.\nOption I: L at 2, O at 5, I at 5 → conflict.\n\nAnd if L at 3:\n- L at 3.\n- O can be at 1,4,5 (3 taken, so 1,4,5)\n- I can be at 1,2,5 (3 taken, so 1,2,5)\n\nSo:\nOption J: L at 3, O at 1, I at 2 → positions 4 and 5.\nOption K: L at 3, O at 1, I at 5 → positions 2 and 4.\nOption L: L at 3, O at 4, I at 1 → positions 2 and 5.\nOption M: L at 3, O at 4, I at 2 → positions 1 and 5.\nOption N: L at 3, O at 4, I at 5 → positions 1 and 2.\nOption O: L at 3, O at 5, I at 1 → positions 2 and 4.\nOption P: L at 3, O at 5, I at 2 → positions 1 and 4.\nOption Q: L at 3, O at 5, I at 5 → conflict.\n\nNow, we need to fill the remaining positions with letters from the available set: B,F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Z.\n\nAnd form a valid word.\n\nWe also have to consider that in the feedback, for ""doily"", O, I, L were all misplaced, so in the new word, they must be in different positions.\n\nNow, let\'s try to find a word that matches one of these patterns.\n\nStart with L at position 1: Option A: L at 1, I at 2, O at 4 → positions 3 and 5 to fill.\n\nSo pattern: L I ? O ?\n\nWe need a word: L I _ O _\n\nWith the blank positions 3 and 5 filled with letters not absent.\n\nPossible words? Like ""LIGHT"" but G and H, but ""LIGHT"" has I at 2, O? No, ""LIGHT"" is L,I,G,H,T → no O.\n\n""LIMBO"" - L,I,M,B,O → but O is at position 5, not 4. We need O at 4.\n\nIn this pattern, O must be at 4.\n\nSo ""L I ? O ?"" → position 4 is O.\n\nWhat words start with ""LI"" and have O at position 4? And 5th letter.\n\nFor example, ""LILIO"" not a word.\n\n""LINGO"" but N is absent.\n\n""LIVID"" but V and D, D is absent.\n\n""LIBRO"" but B,R,O? R is absent.\n\nR is absent? From guess 1, R(x), so absent.\n\nAvailable: B,F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Z\n\n""LITIO"" not a word.\n\n""LIKEO"" not a word.\n\n""LIMO"" is 4 letters.\n\n""LITHO"" - L,I,T,H,O → positions: L1, I2, T3, H4, O5 → but we need O at position 4? Here O is at 5.\n\nNot matching.\n\nPerhaps no common word for this pattern.\n\nOption B: L at 1, I at 2, O at 5 → pattern: L I ? ? O\n\nSo word: L I _ _ O\n\nExamples: ""LINGO"" but N absent.\n\n""LITMO"" not a word.\n\n""LIVID"" but D absent.\n\n""LIGHT"" no O.\n\n""LIMBO"" - L,I,M,B,O → that\'s L1,I2,M3,B4,O5 → so O at 5, which matches. And M and B are allowed? M and B not absent.\n\n""LIMBO"" is a word.\n\nBut check constraints: O at position 5? In ""spoil"", O was at 3 and wrong, and in ""doily"" O at 2 and wrong, but position 5 is allowed for O? Yes, from above O can be at 5.\n\nI at position 2: in ""spoil"" I was at 4 and wrong, in ""doily"" at 3 and wrong, position 2 is allowed for I? Yes, I can be at 2.\n\nL at position 1: in ""spoil"" L was at 5 and wrong, in ""doily"" at 4 and wrong, position 1 is allowed for L? Yes.\n\nSo ""LIMBO"" seems possible.\n\nBut we have to check if it uses only allowed letters: L,I,M,B,O. M and B are not absent, so allowed.\n\nBut O is already known, so we are testing M and B.\n\nNow, Option C: L at 1, I at 5, O at 4 → pattern: L ? ? O I\n\nWord: L _ _ O I\n\nLike ""LOOBI"" not a word.\n\n""LOTUS"" but T,U,S? S absent.\n\n""LOCUS"" S absent.\n\n""LOVAT"" not common.\n\n""LOGIC"" but G,I,C? C absent and I at 5? ""LOGIC"" is L,O,G,I,C → C absent and positions: O at 2, not 4.\n\nNot matching.\n\nSo ""LIMBO"" is a candidate.\n\nNow, other cases.\n\nL at 2: Option E: L at 2, O at 1, I at 5 → pattern: O L ? ? I\n\nWord: O L _ _ I\n\nExamples: ""OLIVE"" but V,E? E absent.\n\n""OLIVI"" not a word.\n\n""OLPHA"" not a word.\n\nNot easy.\n\nOption F: L at 2, O at 4, I at 1 → pattern: I L ? O ?\n\nWord: I L _ O _\n\nLike ""ILIUM"" but M,U? ""ILIUM"" is I,L,I,U,M? Not 5 distinct? And U and M.\n\nBut I repeated? ""ILIUM"" has two I\'s? Positions: I1, L2, I3, U4, M5? But we need O at 4, here U at 4.\n\nNot.\n\n""ILKDO"" not a word.\n\nOption G: L at 2, O at 4, I at 5 → pattern: ? L ? O I\n\nWord: _ L _ O I\n\nLike ""ALOFT"" but A absent.\n\n""BLOKI"" not a word.\n\n""GLYPH"" but G,L,Y? Y absent.\n\nY is absent from guess 3.\n\nOption H: L at 2, O at 5, I at 1 → pattern: I L ? ? O\n\nWord: I L _ _ O\n\nLike ""ILKDO"" no.\n\n""IMAGE"" but M,A,G,E? A and E absent.\n\nNot.\n\nNow L at 3: Option J: L at 3, O at 1, I at 2 → pattern: O I L ? ?\n\nWord: O I L _ _\n\nLike ""OILED"" but E,D absent.\n\n""OILER"" E absent.\n\n""OILTY"" not a word.\n\nOption K: L at 3, O at 1, I at 5 → pattern: O ? L ? I\n\nWord: O _ L _ I\n\nLike ""OWLFI"" no.\n\n""OCTLI"" not a word.\n\nOption L: L at 3, O at 4, I at 1 → pattern: I ? L O ?\n\nWord: I _ L O _\n\nLike ""IDOLA"" but D,A absent.\n\n""IGLOO"" but G,O,O? O repeated, and we have I at 1, G at 2, L at 3, O at 4 and 5? But pattern: I _ L O _ , so position 5 is open.\n\n""IGLOO"" is I,G,L,O,O → so positions: I1, G2, L3, O4, O5. So it matches the pattern I _ L O _ with the last being O.\n\nBut we have O at 4 and 5? But in the pattern, we have O at 4, and position 5 is filled with O, which is fine.\n\nBut we already considered ""IGLOO"" earlier? But in ""IGLOO"", L is at position 3, which is allowed? L can be at 3? Yes, from constraints.\n\nO at 4: in ""spoil"" O was at 3 and wrong, so position 4 is new and allowed. In ""doily"" O was at 2 and wrong, so position 4 is not forbidden for O? O cannot be at 2 or 3, so 4 is okay.\n\nI at 1: in ""spoil"" I was at 4 and wrong, in ""doily"" at 3 and wrong, so position 1 is allowed.\n\nSo ""IGLOO"" is a possible word.\n\nBut it has two O\'s? That\'s acceptable.\n\nLetters: I,G,L,O,O. G is new and allowed.\n\nBut we already have O,I,L present, so we are testing G.\n\nNow, back to ""LIMBO"" and ""IGLOO"".\n\nWe have two candidates: ""LIMBO"" and ""IGLOO"".\n\nBut in ""LIMBO"", we have M and B, two new letters.\n\nIn ""IGLOO"", we have G and an extra O.\n\nBut O is already known, so we get less new information? But we might confirm if there is a double O.\n\nBut we don\'t know.\n\nPerhaps we can choose a word with more new letters.\n\nAnother option: Option M: L at 3, O at 4, I at 2 → pattern: ? I L O ?\n\nWord: _ I L O _\n\nLike ""WILCO"" not common.\n\n""KILOS"" but S absent.\n\n""TILTH"" T,H? ""TILTH"" is T,I,L,T,H? Not 5 distinct? T repeated.\n\n""BILLY"" but Y absent and no O.\n\nNot.\n\nOption N: L at 3, O at 4, I at 5 → pattern: ? ? L O I\n\nWord: _ _ L O I\n\nLike ""BLOKI"" no.\n\n""GLYCO"" not.\n\nOption O: L at 3, O at 5, I at 1 → pattern: I ? L ? O\n\nWord: I _ L _ O\n\nLike ""IDOLO"" but D absent.\n\n""IGLOO"" is I,G,L,O,O → but O at 4 and 5, not at 5 only? Pattern I _ L _ O would be I at1, ? at2, L at3, ? at4, O at5.\n\nBut in ""IGLOO"", it\'s I at1, G at2, L at3, O at4, O at5 → so position 4 is O, not the fifth? For the pattern I _ L _ O, we need O at position 5, but in ""IGLOO"" position 5 is O, but position 4 is also O, so it doesn\'t match the pattern exactly? The pattern requires a letter at position 4, but in ""IGLOO"" it\'s O, which is fine, but the pattern for Option O is I at1, ? at2, L at3, ? at4, O at5.\n\nIn ""IGLOO"", position 4 is O, which is not a new letter, but the pattern allows it? The pattern doesn\'t specify what is at 4, it can be O.\n\nBut in this case, for Option O, we have I at1, L at3, O at5, and positions 2 and 4 to fill.\n\nIn ""IGLOO"", position 2 is G and position 4 is O, so it fits if we consider position 4 as O, which is allowed.\n\nBut Option O is for L at3, O at5, I at1.\n\nIn ""IGLOO"", O is at5? Position 5 is O, yes. And O at4 is extra.\n\nBut the pattern is satisfied.\n\nSimilarly, Option P: L at3, O at5, I at2 → pattern: ? I L ? O\n\nWord: _ I L _ O\n\nLike ""FILMO"" not a word.\n\n""WILCO"" not.\n\nSo the main candidates are ""LIMBO"" and ""IGLOO"".\n\nNow, which one to choose?\n\n""LIMBO"" tests two new letters: M and B.\n\n""IGLOO"" tests one new letter: G, and might indicate if O is repeated.\n\nBut since we have limited guesses, testing more new letters might be better.\n\nAlso, ""LIMBO"" is a valid word.\n\nAnother word: what about ""MILKO""? Not common.\n\nOr ""TOUCH"" but T,O,U,C,H? C absent.\n\nPerhaps ""GUILD"" but U,I,L,D? D absent and no O.\n\nD is absent.\n\nAnother possibility: Option from L at1, I at5, O at4: we didn\'t find a word.\n\nBut let\'s list all possible words we can think of with O,I,L and two new letters.\n\nFor example, ""OIL"" with extensions? Hard.\n\n""FOUL"" but F,O,U,L? No I.\n\n""JOINT"" but J,O,I,N,T? N absent.\n\n""QUOIT"" Q,U,O,I,T? But Q and U, and T. N not present? ""QUOIT"" is a word, but let\'s see: Q,U,O,I,T.\n\nLetters: Q,U,O,I,T. All not absent? Absent: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,D,Y. So Q,U,O,I,T are all allowed.\n\nNow, positions: we need to place O,I,L? But ""QUOIT"" has O,I, but no L? L is required! We must have L in the word.\n\n""QUOIT"" does not have L, so it cannot be, because L is present.\n\nSimilarly, ""BUOYS"" but S absent and no I,L.\n\nWe must include L.\n\nAnother word: ""BUILT"" but U,I,L,T? No O.\n\n""OLLIE"" but O,L,L,I,E? E absent and double L.\n\nNot.\n\n""LOTUS"" S absent.\n\nPerhaps ""LIMBO"" is the best so far.\n\n""THOLI"" not common.\n\n""VOTIVE"" 6 letters.\n\nI think ""LIMBO"" is a good guess.\n\nBut let\'s confirm the positions in ""LIMBO"":\n\n- L at position 1\n- I at position 2\n- M at position 3\n- B at position 4\n- O at position 5\n\nNow, constraints:\n\nFor O: must not be at 2 or 3. Here at 5, which is allowed.\n\nFor I: must not be at 3 or 4. Here at 2, which is allowed.\n\nFor L: must not be at 4 or 5. Here at 1, which is allowed.\n\nAnd M and B are new.\n\nSo it should be fine.\n\nSimilarly, ""IGLOO"": I at1, G at2, L at3, O at4, O at5.\n\nO at4: allowed? O cannot be at 2 or 3, so 4 is new and allowed.\n\nL at3: allowed? L cannot be at 4 or 5, so 3 is allowed.\n\nI at1: allowed? I cannot be at 3 or 4, so 1 is allowed.\n\nBut O at5 is also present, but that\'s fine.\n\nBut in terms of information, ""LIMBO"" tests two new letters, so I prefer that.\n\nWe could also consider ""LOGIN"" but N absent.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""LIMBO"".\n\nBut is ""LIMBO"" accepted? Yes.\n\nSo guess: ""LIMBO""\n\nBut in the feedback, we have to see.\n\nAnother word: ""BOWL"" not 5 letters.\n\n""CLIMB"" C absent.\n\nSo ""LIMBO"" it is.\n\n<guess>limbo</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Review Feedback from Previous Guesses**:\n   - **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). These letters cannot be in the secret word.\n   - **Guess 2 (""spoil"")**: \n     - S and P are absent (x), so they are also excluded.\n     - O, I, L are present but misplaced (-). This means:\n       - O is in the word, but not at position 3.\n       - I is in the word, but not at position 4.\n       - L is in the word, but not at position 5.\n   - **Guess 3 (""doily"")**:\n     - D and Y are absent (x), so they are excluded.\n     - O, I, L are present but misplaced (-). This adds new constraints:\n       - O is not at position 2 (since it was misplaced there in ""doily"").\n       - I is not at position 3 (misplaced in ""doily"").\n       - L is not at position 4 (misplaced in ""doily"").\n\n2. **Deductions**:\n   - **Absent Letters**: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, D, Y (9 letters excluded).\n   - **Present Letters**: O, I, L must be in the secret word, but their positions are unknown. Constraints on their positions:\n     - O: Cannot be at positions 2 or 3 → possible positions: 1, 4, or 5.\n     - I: Cannot be at positions 3 or 4 → possible positions: 1, 2, or 5.\n     - L: Cannot be at positions 4 or 5 → possible positions: 1, 2, or 3.\n   - **Available Letters**: The secret word must include O, I, L, plus two new letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding absent letters). Remaining letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.\n\n3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:\n   - The new guess must:\n     - Include O, I, and L (since they are confirmed present).\n     - Place O, I, and L in positions that satisfy all constraints (e.g., O not at 2/3, I not at 3/4, L not at 4/5).\n     - Use two new letters from the available set to maximize information.\n     - Avoid all absent letters.\n   - After evaluating possible words, **""LIMBO""** is a strong candidate because:\n     - Letters: L, I, M, B, O.\n       - O, I, L are included (required).\n       - M and B are new, untested letters (from available set).\n       - No absent letters are used.\n     - Positions:\n       - L at position 1: Allowed (L cannot be at 4/5, and position 1 is valid).\n       - I at position 2: Allowed (I cannot be at 3/4, and position 2 is valid).\n       - O at position 5: Allowed (O cannot be at 2/3, and position 5 is valid).\n     - This tests new letters (M and B) while respecting all positional constraints for O, I, L.\n\n4. **Why ""LIMBO""?**:\n   - It is a valid 5-letter English word.\n   - It adheres to all feedback constraints.\n   - It maximizes new information by testing M and B, which could help identify more letters or positions in future guesses.\n   - Alternatives like ""IGLOO"" were considered, but ""LIMBO"" is preferred for testing two new letters instead of one (G in ""IGLOO""), providing better coverage.\n\n<guess>limbo</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: spoil -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(-) I(-) L(-)\nGuess 3: doily -> FEEDBACK: D(x) O(-) I(-) L(-) Y(x)\nGuess 4: limbo -> FEEDBACK: L(-) I(-) M(x) B(x) O(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given the feedback for Guess 4: limbo -> L(-), I(-), M(x), B(x), O(✓)

Let's break down all feedback:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x): None of these letters are in the word.

Guess 2: spoil -> S(x), P(x), O(-), I(-), L(-): O, I, L are in the word but not in positions 3, 4, 5 respectively (since spoil was S-P-O-I-L).

Guess 3: doily -> D(x), O(-), I(-), L(-), Y(x): O, I, L are in the word but not in positions 2, 3, 4 respectively.

Guess 4: limbo -> L(-), I(-), M(x), B(x), O(✓): 
- O is now in the correct position: position 5 (since limbo is L-I-M-B-O, so O at position 5 is correct).
- L is present but not at position 1.
- I is present but not at position 2.
- M and B are absent.

So now we have:

Correct placement:
- O is at position 5.

Present letters (wrong positions):
- O is also confirmed present (but we know one O is at position 5, there might be more? The feedback for Guess4 only tells us the O at position 5 is correct, but the other O? There was only one O in limbo. However, we know from Guess2 and Guess3 that O is present, so now we know one O is at position 5. If there were another O, we don't know, but until now, no guess had multiple O's so we don't have evidence of more).

Wait, the feedback for Guess4: L(-), I(-), M(x), B(x), O(✓) only tells us about the O at position 5. The L and I are still present but wrong position.

Additionally, we have:
- L cannot be at positions 1 (limbo), 4 (doily), 5 (spoil). So possible positions for L: 2, 3.
- I cannot be at positions 2 (limbo), 3 (doily), 4 (spoil). So possible positions for I: 1, 5. But wait: position 5 is now taken by O. So I can only be at position 1? Because positions: 1 and 5 were possible, but 5 is occupied by O. So I must be at position 1? Not necessarily: the secret word may have repeated letters? But we don't know if I can be at position 5? Since position 5 is fixed as O, I cannot be at position 5. So I must be at position 1? But let me check: 

Actually, I cannot be at position 5 because position 5 is taken by O? Not necessarily, unless the word has only one letter per position? Yes, each position is for one letter. So if O is fixed at position 5, no other letter can be at that position.

So for I:
- Previously: cannot be at positions 3 (from doily), 4 (from spoil), and now cannot be at position 2 (limbo). The remaining possible position was 1 and 5. But now position 5 is taken by O. Therefore I must be at position 1? But what if the word has two I's? Then I could be at position 5? But wait, at position 5 we have O, so even if there were two I's, one I could not occupy position 5 because O is there. So I must be at position 1? Unless we have I at another position? But the constraints only forbid positions 2,3,4. Position 1 is still allowed.

But note: we have L and I both to place. And we also have other letters.

Similarly for L: cannot be at positions 1 (from limbo), 4 (doily), 5 (spoil). So L can only be at positions 2 or 3.

Now, we have two more letters to find? Because the word has 5 positions:
Position 5: O
We have L and I to place, but also two more letters? Because we have 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

Positions: 
Position 1: ?
Position 2: ?
Position 3: ?
Position 4: ?
Position 5: O

We know that I must be in the word. Since it cannot be at 2,3,4 and position 5 is taken, it must be at position 1? Or could it be at another position? The constraints we have for I: it must appear in the word and cannot be at positions 2,3,4. And the available positions are 1 and 5? But position 5 is taken by O. Therefore I must be at position 1? Yes? Because if not at position 1, it would have to be at a forbidden position? Then the only remaining position is 1.

Similarly, L must be in the word and cannot be at positions 1,4,5. Position 5 is taken by O, so L can be at positions 2 or 3.

Therefore, we have:
Position 1: must be I? Because that's the only position left for I.

But wait: we don't know if I is at position 1 for sure? Because the secret word might have multiple I's? Then I could also be at a position we didn't guess? But we have constraints: from previous guesses, we only know that I is not at positions 2,3,4, and now cannot be at 5 (because O). And position 1 is allowed. So if there is an I, it must be at position 1? 

Similarly, L must be at positions 2 or 3.

Now, let's list what we know:

- Present letters: O, I, L (with O fixed at position 5)
- Must have I at position 1? Very likely.
- L at either position 2 or 3.

Additionally, we have two more letters: positions 3 and 4? No:

Let me assign:

Position 1: I (because I must be somewhere, and the only available position given constraints and that position 5 is taken) 
But wait: we have 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.
Position 5: O (fixed).
Position 1: available? So if I is in the word, it must be at position 1? Because if it were at another position, say position 2, but that's forbidden. Similarly, if we imagine I at position 1, that's fine? But what about position 3? Forbidden for I? 

So yes: I is forced to position 1? Unless the secret word has an extra I? If there are two I's, it could be at position 1 and another. But then the other I would have to be at a position that is not 2,3,4, but the only other position is 5? But position 5 is O. So no, it must be only one I? We don't know? But it could be at position 1? Let me check further.

Alternatively, we can consider: the secret word must contain the letter I and it must appear only in allowed positions. The allowed positions for I are 1 and 5 (from positions 1-5). Since position 5 is O, then I must be at position 1? Therefore, we deduce that position 1 must be I.

Similarly, L must be at position 2 or 3.

Now, for the remaining positions: 
If L is at position 2, then positions 3 and 4 are two new letters? But we have position 4 which is unknown? And position 3 is unknown.

If L is at position 3, then positions 2 and 4 are unknown.

Additionally, we have absent letters: from Guess1: C, R, A, N, E; Guess2: S, P; Guess3: D, Y; Guess4: M, B. So total absent: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,D,Y,M,B.

Also, O is used at position 5, but could there be more O's? Not necessarily.

We need two more letters for the remaining positions? But they must be letters not absent and not O,I,L? But O is at 5, I at 1, so for positions 2,3,4? Depending on L.

But wait, the word structure:

Either:
Option A: Position1=I, Position2=L, Position3=?, Position4=?, Position5=O

Option B: Position1=I, Position2=?, Position3=L, Position4=?, Position5=O

Now, we have to pick letters for the gaps? And form a valid word.

Available letters: since absent letters are C,R,A,N,E,S,P,D,Y,M,B.

Remaining letters: F,G,H,J,K,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Z

We need to use two letters from this set for the gaps.

For Option A: pattern ""I L ? ? O""
For Option B: pattern ""I ? L ? O""

Now, find valid English words:

First, Option A: ""IL??O""
For example: 
- ""ILK"" words: but we need 5 letters, so ""IL"" + two letters + ""O"". Like ""ILKAO""? Not a word.
- ""ILLYO""? but Y absent? And ""ILL"" has double L? But L is at position 2? And if we put L at position 2, then we have only one L? So positions: I,L,?,?,O.

Words: 
""ILAMO"" - not common, invalid?
""IMAGE"" - but M,A,G,E? M and A absent? M is now absent (from guess4), A absent? From guess1: A(x). So not.
""ILVES"" but S absent? And E? No, E absent.
Not easy.

Perhaps ""IGLO"" ... wait, ""IGLOO""? But that has O at the end? But also at beginning? ""IGLOO"" is I-G-L-O-O? So pattern: I,G,L,O,O -> positions: I1, G2, L3, O4, O5. But we have O5, so O at position 4? That's allowed? But in our pattern for Option A, we have positions:
1: I
2: L -> but in ""IGLOO"" position2 is G, not L? So pattern ""IGLOO"" is I-G-L-O-O, so it's Option B: I at1, G at2, L at3, O at4, O at5? But we need position4 to be ?, then O5? But here position4 is O? And position5 is O? In ""IGLOO"", position5 is O? Our fixed position5 is O? But we have an extra O at position4?

But our word must have O at position5? Then ""IGLOO"" has O at position4 and position5? So at position4: O? Which is fine? But in our fixed structure for Option B: ""I ? L ? O"", the last letter O? But in ""IGLOO"", the last letter is O? But the pattern: position1=I, position2=G, position3=L, position4=O, position5=O? So yes? But the second O at position5? 

So it would be: I at1, ? at2=G, L at3, ? at4=O, O at5? So the ? at4 is O? But O is already used? But that's fine? But we are testing? We know O is in the word? But we are putting O at position4? Which is a new position? And it might be correct? Or wrong? 

But in our case: position5 is O, fixed? And we are putting an extra O at position4? 

But let me see: what is Option B? Pattern: ""I ? L ? O"" -> meaning position1=I, position3=L, position5=O, then position2 and position4 are unknown? So position4 can be O? If the word has two O's? 

But in this situation, our word would be ""IGLOO"": 
I at pos1: must? Because I must be at1? And O at5: must? Then L at3? Which is allowed? Then position2=G, position4=O? That fits? But we have to check feedback? 

Wait, let's list:

From Option B: we have I at1, L at3, O at5, then position2: ?, position4: ? 

""IGLOO"" fits: position1=I, position2=G, position3=L, position4=O, position5=O.

Now, check constraints:

I at position1: was it forbidden? No, because I cannot be at positions 2,3,4? Position1 is allowed? 

L at position3: was forbidden? L cannot be at positions 4 and 5? And we had position1 as forbidden? But position3 is not forbidden? Yes: L possible positions were 1,2,3? But position1 is given to I? Then L must be at 2 or 3? So at3 is fine.

O at position5: fixed? And also O at position4? That's fine? But does the secret word allow that?

But we haven't guessed ""IGLOO"", so this is candidate?

But we already have O at position5 fixed? So the secret word has O at position5? Then ""IGLOO"" as a candidate? But we have to guess now? 

Alternatively, let's list candidate words for each option.

First, Option B: pattern ""I?L?O""

Known: I at1, L at3, O at5, so word pattern: [I] [letter2] [L] [letter4] [O]

We need a valid word? And letter2 and letter4 are from available set? F,G,H,J,K,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Z

What words? 

For example: 
- ""INKLO""? But N? Absent.
- ""I L L O"" not 5?
- ""IDOLO""? D absent? And O at5? But pattern: I,D,O,L,O? Positions: I1, D2, O3? Wait, no: pattern is I, letter2, L, letter4, O? For ""IDOLO"": I-D-O-L-O? That's not? Pattern: position2 must be letter2? Position3: L? But in ""IDOLO"": position3 is O? Then position4: L? Then position5: O? So if word is ""I D O L O"", we have: I1, D2, O3, L4, O5? Then L is at position4? But L cannot be at position4? From doily: L was at position4 and wrong? That's forbidden? So L cannot be at position4? Therefore ""IDOLO"" is invalid? Because L at position4? 

In fact, our pattern has L at position3? Otherwise it doesn't fit? 

So we must have L at position3? For Option B.

And the word must have L at position3? For the pattern.

Therefore, words: [I] [X] [L] [Y] [O], with X and Y in available letters? And Y must be placed? 

For example:
- ""IGLOO"": I1, G2, L3, O4, O5 → so Y at position4 is O? 
But O is not from the available? It's okay? Because O is already present? So that's fine? In fact, O can be used? 

Moreover, are there others?
- ""ITLLO""? Not a word.
- ""I L L O""? Not 5 letters.
- ""IZ"" words? Not many.
- ""IX"" words? ""IX"" not.

Another possibility: ""IGLOO"" is the only common word? 

Then we have Option A? 

First, Option A: pattern ""IL??O"": meaning I1, L2, X3, Y4, O5? 

Words: 
- ""ILECO""? E,C? Absent.
- ""ILA"" words? But A absent.
- ""ILKDO""? D? Absent.
- ""ILY""? But Y absent? And not 5 letters? 
- ""ILF""? Not words? 

""ILUDO""? U,D? D absent? 
Not? 

So back to Option B: ""I?L?O"" with L at3.

Therefore, the only candidate I know is ""IGLOO"": I1, G2, L3, O4, O5.

But what about other words? 
- ""IX"" not?
- ""IN"" N absent?
- ""I H L E O""? H,E? E absent? 
- ""I H L I O""? Then two I's? Position1=I, position4=I? But I? Then ""IHLIO""? Not a word? 
- ""IJOLU""? J,O,L,U? But pattern: I1,J2,O3? But we need position3=L? So no? Must be position3=L? 

So ""IGLOO"" is a candidate? Then we should guess ""IGLOO"", but wait: 

But we already guessed? Not? 

Alternatively, we can consider: Is there ""IF"" word? 

""IF"" words? ""I F L U O""? ""IFLUO"" not a word? 

""ITEMO""? Not? 

Another word: ""ITH"" not? 

Perhaps ""KILO""? But not starting with I? 

So I think ""IGLOO"" is the most plausible? 

But let me check: in this case, for position4: O? Is there issue? 

But we know from constraint: for O, we had O must not be at position2 or position3? And at position4? It was never forbidden? So okay? 

But also, note that we have O at position4: and we already have O at position5? So if we guess ""IGLOO"", then:

Position1: I (which we think must be, but not fixed? But in feedback? Wait: we are going to guess? 

But we have to guess now? 

Alternatively, we can guess a word that confirms? 

Another candidate: ""INCOG""? Not? 

But we have available letters: F,G,H,J,K,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Z

So for Option B: pattern: I, X, L, Y, O? 

Words? 

- ""IT Log"" not? 
- ""I T L U O"" -> ""ITLUO""? Not a word? 
- ""I G L U O"" -> ""IGLUO""? Not common? ""Igloo"" is spelled with two O's? But ""IGLU"" is without O? 

Actually, ""IGLOO"" is the valid spelling? With double O? So yes? 

Therefore, I think ""IGLOO"" is a valid candidate? 

But note: we have M and B absent? In guess4? And now we are using G? 

Why didn't I include ""IGLOO"" earlier? Because we didn't know O at position5? 

Now we know? 

But wait: in step by step? 

Alternatively, we can guess another word? 

Another possibility: what about ""TOUSE"" not? 

But to be systematic? 

It must be ""IGLOO""? 

But let me see: we could also have L at position2? Then pattern ""I L X Y O""? 

But we must find words? 

For example: ""ILUKO""? Not? 

""I L O U O""? Positions: I1, L2, O3, U4, O5? But O3? O cannot be at position3? Forbidden? Because from spoil: O at position3 wrong? And doily: O at position2 wrong? So O cannot be at position3? Therefore a word with O at position3 is not allowed? Similarly in our pattern? So if we have ""I L O U O"", O at position3? Forbidden? 

Moreover, L at position2? And position4: U? 

But also O at position3? Not allowed? 

Therefore, impossible? So only Option B: L at position3? 

And then we must have ""IGLOO"" as candidate? 

Therefore, guess ""IGLOO""? 

But we have to form the word? 

Or another: ""IZ"" none? 

So I'll go with ""IGLOO""? 

But note: we guessed ""do"" and ""limbo""? So we didn't guess this? 

Also, in ""IGLOO"": 
- Position1: I → we expect it to be correct? Or not? 
- Position2: G → new?
- Position3: L → but we know L must be present? And at position3? 
- Position4: O → that's new? Or we know O is in word, so not new? 
- Position5: O → fixed? 

But we put O at position4? Which might be correct? 

We'll get feedback? 

So guess: ""IGLOO""

But what about the I at position1? Is it correct? We don't know? 

But according to our deduction, I must be at position1? And position1 must be I? 

Similarly, the word must consist: I at1, O at5, L at2 or 3? But we think L at3? 

So yes? 

Also, we have avoid absent letters? G is not absent? 

So ""IGLOO"" is allowed? 

Therefore, let us make the guess: ""IGLOO""

So <guess>igloo</guess>

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

#### Reviewing Feedback:
1. **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). → Excluded: C, R, A, N, E.
2. **Guess 2 (""spoil"")**: 
   - S and P absent (x). → Excluded: S, P.
   - O, I, L present but misplaced (-). → Constraints: O ≠ pos 3, I ≠ pos 4, L ≠ pos 5.
3. **Guess 3 (""doily"")**: 
   - D and Y absent (x). → Excluded: D, Y.
   - O, I, L present but misplaced (-). → New constraints: O ≠ pos 2, I ≠ pos 3, L ≠ pos 4.
4. **Guess 4 (""limbo"")**: 
   - L at pos 1 misplaced (-). → Constraint: L ≠ pos 1.
   - I at pos 2 misplaced (-). → Constraint: I ≠ pos 2.
   - M and B absent (x). → Excluded: M, B.
   - O at pos 5 correct (✓). → Confirmed: Secret word has O at position 5.

#### Key Deductions:
- **Absent Letters**: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, D, Y, M, B (11 letters excluded).
- **Present Letters**:
  - O: Confirmed at pos 5. Constraints: O ≠ pos 2, 3.
  - I: Present but misplaced. Constraints: I ≠ pos 2, 3, 4. The only valid positions left are 1 or 5, but pos 5 is occupied by O → I must be at pos 1 (since multi-I not confirmed).
  - L: Present but misplaced. Constraints: L ≠ pos 1, 4, 5. Valid positions: 2 or 3.
- **Word Structure**: 
  - Pos 1: Must be I (deduced).
  - Pos 5: Must be O (confirmed).
  - Pos 2 and 3: L must be at one of these (pos 3 suggested by pattern).
  - Remaining positions (e.g., pos 3 or 4): Require new letters.
- **Available Letters**: Must use letters not excluded. Remaining: F, G, H, J, K, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

#### Evaluating Possibilities:
- **Pattern Options**:
  - If L at pos 3 (allowed): Word structure is [I] [position 2: new] [L] [position 4: new] [O].
  - If L at pos 2 (allowed): Word structure is [I] [L] [position 3: new] [position 4: new] [O]. However:
    - Position 4 must be a new letter.
    - Position 3 must avoid conflicting with L.
- **Finding Valid Words**:
  - **Option A (L at pos 3)**: Pattern ""I ? L ? O"" → e.g., ""IGLOO"" (I at pos 1, G at pos 2, L at pos 3, O at pos 4, O at pos 5).
    - Fits constraints: O at pos 5 correct; I not at forbidden positions; L at pos 3 allowed (since L ≠ pos 4/5).
    - Uses G (new letter) and O (known) → Maximizes feedback potential.
  - **Other Options**: Words like ""I H L U O"" (""IHLUO"" invalid) or ""I T L I O"" (""ITLIO"" invalid) were considered, but ""IGLOO"" is the only valid 5-letter English word matching the pattern and constraints.

#### Why ""IGLOO""?
- Tests:
  - Deduced I at pos 1 (must validate).
  - L at pos 3 (plausible, avoids forbidden positions).
  - G (new letter) at pos 2 for additional coverage.
  - Extra O at pos 4 to test for duplicate O (not invalidated by past feedback).
- Avoids Absent Letters: Uses only G (untested and not excluded).
- Valid Word: Noun (an Inuit shelter).

<guess>igloo</guess>",igloo,"We are given the feedback for Guess 4: limbo -> L(-), I(-), M(x), B(x), O(✓)

Let's break down all feedback:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x): None of these letters are in the word.

Guess 2: spoil -> S(x), P(x), O(-), I(-), L(-): O, I, L are in the word but not in positions 3, 4, 5 respectively (since spoil was S-P-O-I-L).

Guess 3: doily -> D(x), O(-), I(-), L(-), Y(x): O, I, L are in the word but not in positions 2, 3, 4 respectively.

Guess 4: limbo -> L(-), I(-), M(x), B(x), O(✓): 
- O is now in the correct position: position 5 (since limbo is L-I-M-B-O, so O at position 5 is correct).
- L is present but not at position 1.
- I is present but not at position 2.
- M and B are absent.

So now we have:

Correct placement:
- O is at position 5.

Present letters (wrong positions):
- O is also confirmed present (but we know one O is at position 5, there might be more? The feedback for Guess4 only tells us the O at position 5 is correct, but the other O? There was only one O in limbo. However, we know from Guess2 and Guess3 that O is present, so now we know one O is at position 5. If there were another O, we don't know, but until now, no guess had multiple O's so we don't have evidence of more).

Wait, the feedback for Guess4: L(-), I(-), M(x), B(x), O(✓) only tells us about the O at position 5. The L and I are still present but wrong position.

Additionally, we have:
- L cannot be at positions 1 (limbo), 4 (doily), 5 (spoil). So possible positions for L: 2, 3.
- I cannot be at positions 2 (limbo), 3 (doily), 4 (spoil). So possible positions for I: 1, 5. But wait: position 5 is now taken by O. So I can only be at position 1? Because positions: 1 and 5 were possible, but 5 is occupied by O. So I must be at position 1? Not necessarily: the secret word may have repeated letters? But we don't know if I can be at position 5? Since position 5 is fixed as O, I cannot be at position 5. So I must be at position 1? But let me check: 

Actually, I cannot be at position 5 because position 5 is taken by O? Not necessarily, unless the word has only one letter per position? Yes, each position is for one letter. So if O is fixed at position 5, no other letter can be at that position.

So for I:
- Previously: cannot be at positions 3 (from doily), 4 (from spoil), and now cannot be at position 2 (limbo). The remaining possible position was 1 and 5. But now position 5 is taken by O. Therefore I must be at position 1? But what if the word has two I's? Then I could be at position 5? But wait, at position 5 we have O, so even if there were two I's, one I could not occupy position 5 because O is there. So I must be at position 1? Unless we have I at another position? But the constraints only forbid positions 2,3,4. Position 1 is still allowed.

But note: we have L and I both to place. And we also have other letters.

Similarly for L: cannot be at positions 1 (from limbo), 4 (doily), 5 (spoil). So L can only be at positions 2 or 3.

Now, we have two more letters to find? Because the word has 5 positions:
Position 5: O
We have L and I to place, but also two more letters? Because we have 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

Positions: 
Position 1: ?
Position 2: ?
Position 3: ?
Position 4: ?
Position 5: O

We know that I must be in the word. Since it cannot be at 2,3,4 and position 5 is taken, it must be at position 1? Or could it be at another position? The constraints we have for I: it must appear in the word and cannot be at positions 2,3,4. And the available positions are 1 and 5? But position 5 is taken by O. Therefore I must be at position 1? Yes? Because if not at position 1, it would have to be at a forbidden position? Then the only remaining position is 1.

Similarly, L must be in the word and cannot be at positions 1,4,5. Position 5 is taken by O, so L can be at positions 2 or 3.

Therefore, we have:
Position 1: must be I? Because that's the only position left for I.

But wait: we don't know if I is at position 1 for sure? Because the secret word might have multiple I's? Then I could also be at a position we didn't guess? But we have constraints: from previous guesses, we only know that I is not at positions 2,3,4, and now cannot be at 5 (because O). And position 1 is allowed. So if there is an I, it must be at position 1? 

Similarly, L must be at positions 2 or 3.

Now, let's list what we know:

- Present letters: O, I, L (with O fixed at position 5)
- Must have I at position 1? Very likely.
- L at either position 2 or 3.

Additionally, we have two more letters: positions 3 and 4? No:

Let me assign:

Position 1: I (because I must be somewhere, and the only available position given constraints and that position 5 is taken) 
But wait: we have 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.
Position 5: O (fixed).
Position 1: available? So if I is in the word, it must be at position 1? Because if it were at another position, say position 2, but that's forbidden. Similarly, if we imagine I at position 1, that's fine? But what about position 3? Forbidden for I? 

So yes: I is forced to position 1? Unless the secret word has an extra I? If there are two I's, it could be at position 1 and another. But then the other I would have to be at a position that is not 2,3,4, but the only other position is 5? But position 5 is O. So no, it must be only one I? We don't know? But it could be at position 1? Let me check further.

Alternatively, we can consider: the secret word must contain the letter I and it must appear only in allowed positions. The allowed positions for I are 1 and 5 (from positions 1-5). Since position 5 is O, then I must be at position 1? Therefore, we deduce that position 1 must be I.

Similarly, L must be at position 2 or 3.

Now, for the remaining positions: 
If L is at position 2, then positions 3 and 4 are two new letters? But we have position 4 which is unknown? And position 3 is unknown.

If L is at position 3, then positions 2 and 4 are unknown.

Additionally, we have absent letters: from Guess1: C, R, A, N, E; Guess2: S, P; Guess3: D, Y; Guess4: M, B. So total absent: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,D,Y,M,B.

Also, O is used at position 5, but could there be more O's? Not necessarily.

We need two more letters for the remaining positions? But they must be letters not absent and not O,I,L? But O is at 5, I at 1, so for positions 2,3,4? Depending on L.

But wait, the word structure:

Either:
Option A: Position1=I, Position2=L, Position3=?, Position4=?, Position5=O

Option B: Position1=I, Position2=?, Position3=L, Position4=?, Position5=O

Now, we have to pick letters for the gaps? And form a valid word.

Available letters: since absent letters are C,R,A,N,E,S,P,D,Y,M,B.

Remaining letters: F,G,H,J,K,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Z

We need to use two letters from this set for the gaps.

For Option A: pattern ""I L ? ? O""
For Option B: pattern ""I ? L ? O""

Now, find valid English words:

First, Option A: ""IL??O""
For example: 
- ""ILK"" words: but we need 5 letters, so ""IL"" + two letters + ""O"". Like ""ILKAO""? Not a word.
- ""ILLYO""? but Y absent? And ""ILL"" has double L? But L is at position 2? And if we put L at position 2, then we have only one L? So positions: I,L,?,?,O.

Words: 
""ILAMO"" - not common, invalid?
""IMAGE"" - but M,A,G,E? M and A absent? M is now absent (from guess4), A absent? From guess1: A(x). So not.
""ILVES"" but S absent? And E? No, E absent.
Not easy.

Perhaps ""IGLO"" ... wait, ""IGLOO""? But that has O at the end? But also at beginning? ""IGLOO"" is I-G-L-O-O? So pattern: I,G,L,O,O -> positions: I1, G2, L3, O4, O5. But we have O5, so O at position 4? That's allowed? But in our pattern for Option A, we have positions:
1: I
2: L -> but in ""IGLOO"" position2 is G, not L? So pattern ""IGLOO"" is I-G-L-O-O, so it's Option B: I at1, G at2, L at3, O at4, O at5? But we need position4 to be ?, then O5? But here position4 is O? And position5 is O? In ""IGLOO"", position5 is O? Our fixed position5 is O? But we have an extra O at position4?

But our word must have O at position5? Then ""IGLOO"" has O at position4 and position5? So at position4: O? Which is fine? But in our fixed structure for Option B: ""I ? L ? O"", the last letter O? But in ""IGLOO"", the last letter is O? But the pattern: position1=I, position2=G, position3=L, position4=O, position5=O? So yes? But the second O at position5? 

So it would be: I at1, ? at2=G, L at3, ? at4=O, O at5? So the ? at4 is O? But O is already used? But that's fine? But we are testing? We know O is in the word? But we are putting O at position4? Which is a new position? And it might be correct? Or wrong? 

But in our case: position5 is O, fixed? And we are putting an extra O at position4? 

But let me see: what is Option B? Pattern: ""I ? L ? O"" -> meaning position1=I, position3=L, position5=O, then position2 and position4 are unknown? So position4 can be O? If the word has two O's? 

But in this situation, our word would be ""IGLOO"": 
I at pos1: must? Because I must be at1? And O at5: must? Then L at3? Which is allowed? Then position2=G, position4=O? That fits? But we have to check feedback? 

Wait, let's list:

From Option B: we have I at1, L at3, O at5, then position2: ?, position4: ? 

""IGLOO"" fits: position1=I, position2=G, position3=L, position4=O, position5=O.

Now, check constraints:

I at position1: was it forbidden? No, because I cannot be at positions 2,3,4? Position1 is allowed? 

L at position3: was forbidden? L cannot be at positions 4 and 5? And we had position1 as forbidden? But position3 is not forbidden? Yes: L possible positions were 1,2,3? But position1 is given to I? Then L must be at 2 or 3? So at3 is fine.

O at position5: fixed? And also O at position4? That's fine? But does the secret word allow that?

But we haven't guessed ""IGLOO"", so this is candidate?

But we already have O at position5 fixed? So the secret word has O at position5? Then ""IGLOO"" as a candidate? But we have to guess now? 

Alternatively, let's list candidate words for each option.

First, Option B: pattern ""I?L?O""

Known: I at1, L at3, O at5, so word pattern: [I] [letter2] [L] [letter4] [O]

We need a valid word? And letter2 and letter4 are from available set? F,G,H,J,K,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Z

What words? 

For example: 
- ""INKLO""? But N? Absent.
- ""I L L O"" not 5?
- ""IDOLO""? D absent? And O at5? But pattern: I,D,O,L,O? Positions: I1, D2, O3? Wait, no: pattern is I, letter2, L, letter4, O? For ""IDOLO"": I-D-O-L-O? That's not? Pattern: position2 must be letter2? Position3: L? But in ""IDOLO"": position3 is O? Then position4: L? Then position5: O? So if word is ""I D O L O"", we have: I1, D2, O3, L4, O5? Then L is at position4? But L cannot be at position4? From doily: L was at position4 and wrong? That's forbidden? So L cannot be at position4? Therefore ""IDOLO"" is invalid? Because L at position4? 

In fact, our pattern has L at position3? Otherwise it doesn't fit? 

So we must have L at position3? For Option B.

And the word must have L at position3? For the pattern.

Therefore, words: [I] [X] [L] [Y] [O], with X and Y in available letters? And Y must be placed? 

For example:
- ""IGLOO"": I1, G2, L3, O4, O5 → so Y at position4 is O? 
But O is not from the available? It's okay? Because O is already present? So that's fine? In fact, O can be used? 

Moreover, are there others?
- ""ITLLO""? Not a word.
- ""I L L O""? Not 5 letters.
- ""IZ"" words? Not many.
- ""IX"" words? ""IX"" not.

Another possibility: ""IGLOO"" is the only common word? 

Then we have Option A? 

First, Option A: pattern ""IL??O"": meaning I1, L2, X3, Y4, O5? 

Words: 
- ""ILECO""? E,C? Absent.
- ""ILA"" words? But A absent.
- ""ILKDO""? D? Absent.
- ""ILY""? But Y absent? And not 5 letters? 
- ""ILF""? Not words? 

""ILUDO""? U,D? D absent? 
Not? 

So back to Option B: ""I?L?O"" with L at3.

Therefore, the only candidate I know is ""IGLOO"": I1, G2, L3, O4, O5.

But what about other words? 
- ""IX"" not?
- ""IN"" N absent?
- ""I H L E O""? H,E? E absent? 
- ""I H L I O""? Then two I's? Position1=I, position4=I? But I? Then ""IHLIO""? Not a word? 
- ""IJOLU""? J,O,L,U? But pattern: I1,J2,O3? But we need position3=L? So no? Must be position3=L? 

So ""IGLOO"" is a candidate? Then we should guess ""IGLOO"", but wait: 

But we already guessed? Not? 

Alternatively, we can consider: Is there ""IF"" word? 

""IF"" words? ""I F L U O""? ""IFLUO"" not a word? 

""ITEMO""? Not? 

Another word: ""ITH"" not? 

Perhaps ""KILO""? But not starting with I? 

So I think ""IGLOO"" is the most plausible? 

But let me check: in this case, for position4: O? Is there issue? 

But we know from constraint: for O, we had O must not be at position2 or position3? And at position4? It was never forbidden? So okay? 

But also, note that we have O at position4: and we already have O at position5? So if we guess ""IGLOO"", then:

Position1: I (which we think must be, but not fixed? But in feedback? Wait: we are going to guess? 

But we have to guess now? 

Alternatively, we can guess a word that confirms? 

Another candidate: ""INCOG""? Not? 

But we have available letters: F,G,H,J,K,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Z

So for Option B: pattern: I, X, L, Y, O? 

Words? 

- ""IT Log"" not? 
- ""I T L U O"" -> ""ITLUO""? Not a word? 
- ""I G L U O"" -> ""IGLUO""? Not common? ""Igloo"" is spelled with two O's? But ""IGLU"" is without O? 

Actually, ""IGLOO"" is the valid spelling? With double O? So yes? 

Therefore, I think ""IGLOO"" is a valid candidate? 

But note: we have M and B absent? In guess4? And now we are using G? 

Why didn't I include ""IGLOO"" earlier? Because we didn't know O at position5? 

Now we know? 

But wait: in step by step? 

Alternatively, we can guess another word? 

Another possibility: what about ""TOUSE"" not? 

But to be systematic? 

It must be ""IGLOO""? 

But let me see: we could also have L at position2? Then pattern ""I L X Y O""? 

But we must find words? 

For example: ""ILUKO""? Not? 

""I L O U O""? Positions: I1, L2, O3, U4, O5? But O3? O cannot be at position3? Forbidden? Because from spoil: O at position3 wrong? And doily: O at position2 wrong? So O cannot be at position3? Therefore a word with O at position3 is not allowed? Similarly in our pattern? So if we have ""I L O U O"", O at position3? Forbidden? 

Moreover, L at position2? And position4: U? 

But also O at position3? Not allowed? 

Therefore, impossible? So only Option B: L at position3? 

And then we must have ""IGLOO"" as candidate? 

Therefore, guess ""IGLOO""? 

But we have to form the word? 

Or another: ""IZ"" none? 

So I'll go with ""IGLOO""? 

But note: we guessed ""do"" and ""limbo""? So we didn't guess this? 

Also, in ""IGLOO"": 
- Position1: I → we expect it to be correct? Or not? 
- Position2: G → new?
- Position3: L → but we know L must be present? And at position3? 
- Position4: O → that's new? Or we know O is in word, so not new? 
- Position5: O → fixed? 

But we put O at position4? Which might be correct? 

We'll get feedback? 

So guess: ""IGLOO""

But what about the I at position1? Is it correct? We don't know? 

But according to our deduction, I must be at position1? And position1 must be I? 

Similarly, the word must consist: I at1, O at5, L at2 or 3? But we think L at3? 

So yes? 

Also, we have avoid absent letters? G is not absent? 

So ""IGLOO"" is allowed? 

Therefore, let us make the guess: ""IGLOO""

So <guess>igloo</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

#### Reviewing Feedback:
1. **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). → Excluded: C, R, A, N, E.
2. **Guess 2 (""spoil"")**: 
   - S and P absent (x). → Excluded: S, P.
   - O, I, L present but misplaced (-). → Constraints: O ≠ pos 3, I ≠ pos 4, L ≠ pos 5.
3. **Guess 3 (""doily"")**:

   - O at pos 5 correct (✓). → Confirmed: Secret word has O at position 5.

#### Key Deductions:
- **Absent Letters**: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, D, Y, M, B (11 letters excluded).
- **Present Letters**:
  - O: Confirmed at pos 5. Constraints: O ≠ pos 2, 3.
  - I: Present but misplaced. Constraints: I ≠ pos 2, 3, 4. The only valid positions left are 1 or 5, but pos 5 is occupied by O → I must be at pos 1 (since multi-I not confirmed).
  - L: Present but misplaced. Constraints: L ≠ pos 1, 4, 5. Valid positions: 2 or 3.
- **Word Structure**: 
  - Pos 1: Must be I (deduced).
  - Pos 5: Must be O (confirmed).
  - Pos 2 and 3: L must be at one of these (pos 3 suggested by pattern).
  - Remaining positions (e.g., pos 3 or 4): Require new letters.
- **Available Letters**: Must use letters not excluded. Remaining: F, G, H, J, K, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

#### Evaluating Possibilities:
- **Pattern Options**:
  - If L at pos 3 (allowed): Word structure is [I] [position 2: new] [L] [position 4: new] [O].
  - If L at pos 2 (allowed): Word structure is [I] [L] [position 3: new] [position 4: new] [O]. However:
    - Position 4 must be a new letter.
    - Position 3 must avoid conflicting with L.
- **Finding Valid Words**:
  - **Option A (L at pos 3)**: Pattern ""I ? L ? O"" → e.g., ""IGLOO"" (I at pos 1, G at pos 2, L at pos 3, O at pos 4, O at pos 5).
    - Fits constraints: O at pos 5 correct; I not at forbidden positions; L at pos 3 allowed (since L ≠ pos 4/5).
    - Uses G (new letter) and O (known) → Maximizes feedback potential.
  - **Other Options**: Words like ""I H L U O"" (""IHLUO"" invalid) or ""I T L I O"" (""ITLIO"" invalid) were considered, but ""IGLOO"" is the only valid 5-letter English word matching the pattern and constraints.

#### Why ""IGLOO""?
- Tests:
  - Deduced I at pos 1 (must validate).
  - L at pos 3 (plausible, avoids forbidden positions).
  - G (new letter) at pos 2 for additional coverage.
  - Extra O at pos 4 to test for duplicate O (not invalidated by past feedback).
- Avoids Absent Letters: Uses only G (untested and not excluded).
- Valid Word: Noun (an Inuit shelter).",Guess 5: igloo -> FEEDBACK: I(✓) G(✓) L(✓) O(✓) O(✓),SUCCESS
