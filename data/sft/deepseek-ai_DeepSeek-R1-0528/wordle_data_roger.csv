We are starting the game. Since it's the first guess, we don't have any previous feedback.
 We want to choose a word that can give us as much information as possible. Typically, a good starting word has:
 - Five distinct letters to cover more letters.
 - Common vowels and consonants to maximize the chance of hitting some letters.

 Some popular starting words are: CRANE, SLATE, TRACE, AUDIO, etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"". It has:
 C, R, A, N, E -> distinct letters, and it includes vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

 So, my first guess will be CRANE.

<thinking>
We are just starting the game and have no prior feedback. For the first guess, I need to select a word that maximizes information gain. A strong starting word should:
- Use common letters to increase the chance of matching letters in the secret word
- Contain a mix of vowels and consonants
- Avoid repeating letters for broader coverage

Based on common Wordle strategies, words like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" are excellent openers because they cover frequent letters. I'll choose **""CRANE""** for this first guess. It includes:
- Vowels: A, E (two of the most common vowels)
- Consonants: C, R, N (high-frequency consonants)
- All letters are distinct

This guess will reveal information about the presence and positions of several key letters.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(x) -> C is not in the word.
 R(-) -> R is in the word but in the wrong position.
 A(x) -> A is not in the word.
 N(x) -> N is not in the word.
 E(-) -> E is in the word but in the wrong position.

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R was in position 2 (index 1) and E was in position 5 (index 4). So the correct positions for R and E are not 1 and 4 respectively.
 - The letters C, A, N are absent.

 We also know the word has 5 letters and must be a valid English word.

 For the next guess, we want to:
 1. Include R and E (since they are in the word) but in different positions.
 2. Avoid using C, A, N (since they are not in the word).
 3. Use other common letters to test.

 We have to consider the positions:
 - R cannot be in position 1 (since it was in position 1 in ""crane"" and got '-', meaning it's present but not there).
 - E cannot be in position 4 (since it was in position 4 in ""crane"" and got '-').

 Also, note that the word does not have C, A, N.

 Let's think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N.

 Some possibilities: 
 - We can try words with R in positions other than 1, and E in positions other than 4.

 Since R was in position 1 and was wrong, we can try R in position 0, 2, 3, or 4? But note: positions are 0-indexed? 
 In the feedback, the positions are:
   Position 0: C
   Position 1: R
   Position 2: A
   Position 3: N
   Position 4: E

 So R was at index 1, and E at index 4.

 We cannot put R at index 1 again? Actually, we can, but it would be the same position and we know it's wrong. So we should avoid putting R at index 1 and E at index 4.

 However, note that the feedback doesn't prevent R from being at index 1 if there are two R's? But we don't know if there are duplicates. Since we only have one R in the feedback, we assume at least one R. But the word might have two R's? We don't know.

 But the feedback for R was a single '-' at index 1. So if we put R at index 1 again, it would still be wrong. So we should avoid that.

 Similarly for E at index 4.

 Let's try to form a word:

 We need to use 5 letters. We know R and E must be in the word. We can use other letters that are common and not yet tested (and not C, A, N).

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, etc.

 We can try to put R in a new position, say index 0? But then we have to avoid the known absent letters.

 Example words:
 - ""robes"": 
   - R at index 0 (which is new) -> we hope it might be correct or at least test R in a new spot.
   - O: new letter
   - B: new letter
   - E at index 3 (which is not 4, so allowed) -> but note: E was at index 4 and was wrong, so index 3 is new.
   - S: new letter

 But we don't know if O, B, S are in the word.

 Alternatively, we can try to put E in a new position, and R in a new position.

 Another idea: since we have two letters to place (R and E) and we know they are not at positions 1 and 4 respectively, we can try:

 Let me list some words that have R and E, and without C, A, N.

 Possible words: 
   ""tiger"" -> T, I, G, E, R -> but note: R is at the end (index 4) and E is at index 3? 
        positions: 
          T(0), I(1), G(2), E(3), R(4)
        In our feedback, R was at index1 and was wrong. Now we put R at index4 -> that's a new position, so it's okay.
        E was at index4 and was wrong, now we put E at index3 -> that's a new position, so okay.

   But we must avoid A, C, N. ""tiger"" doesn't have them.

   However, we don't know if T, I, G are in the word.

   Let's check: 
        T: not tested -> we can test it.
        I: not tested.
        G: not tested.

   This seems a good candidate.

 Another word: ""power"" -> P, O, W, E, R -> R at index4, E at index3 -> same as above.

 But we have to consider that we have 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.

 We can also consider that we have two known letters (R and E) and we want to test other common letters.

 Let me think of words that include more common letters and avoid the absent ones.

 Common letters: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C (but A, C, N are out, so we have E, R, I, O, T, S, L).

 We already have E and R. So we can try to include T, O, I, S, L.

 For example, ""tires"": 
   T, I, R, E, S -> 
        T at 0, I at 1, R at 2, E at 3, S at 4.
        R is at index2 (which is not 1) -> okay.
        E is at index3 (which is not 4) -> okay.

 But note: we have to avoid A, C, N. ""tires"" doesn't have them.

 However, we are not sure if the word has T, I, S. This guess would test three new letters.

 Alternatively, ""rotes"": 
   R at 0, O at 1, T at 2, E at 3, S at 4.

 This also tests R at 0 and E at 3.

 But note: we have to be cautious because we don't know if the word has duplicate letters.

 Since we don't have any duplicate in the feedback, we assume no duplicates for now.

 Another candidate: ""lures"" -> L, U, R, E, S -> U is less common.

 After considering, I think ""tires"" is a good choice because it tests T, I, S (common letters) and places R and E in new positions.

 However, we must note that the secret word might have the letter at the same position as in ""crane"" for other letters? But we don't have any correct position yet.

 Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has E and R and also uses other common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O.

 Let me try to form a word that has S, T, and/or O.

 Example: ""store"" -> S, T, O, R, E -> 
   positions: 
      S(0), T(1), O(2), R(3), E(4)
   But note: E is at index4, which is the same as in ""crane"" and we know that E is not at index4? 
   Because in ""crane"", E was at index4 and we got '-' meaning it is in the word but not at that position. 
   So we cannot put E at index4 again? Actually, we can, but it would be the same mistake. We know E is not at index4, so putting it there again would be a waste.

 Therefore, we must avoid putting E at index4 and R at index1.

 In ""store"", E is at index4 -> that's the same as before and we know it's wrong. So we avoid.

 How about ""strep"": 
   S(0), T(1), R(2), E(3), P(4) -> 
        R is at index2 (not 1) -> okay.
        E is at index3 (not 4) -> okay.

 But ""strep"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning an infection.

 Alternatively, ""strip"": 
   S(0), T(1), R(2), I(3), P(4) -> but this doesn't have E. We must include E because we know it's in the word.

 So we need to include E.

 Another idea: ""tried"": 
   T(0), R(1), I(2), E(3), D(4) -> 
        But R is at index1 -> that's the same position as in ""crane"" and we know it's wrong. So we avoid R at index1.

 Therefore, we cannot have R at index1.

 How about ""trope"": 
   T(0), R(1), O(2), P(3), E(4) -> 
        R is at index1 -> same as before -> avoid.
        E is at index4 -> same as before -> avoid.

 So that's bad.

 Let me try to put R at index0: 
   Words: ""robed"", ""ropes"", ""roped"", ""roses"", but we avoid A, C, N.

 ""ropes"": 
   R(0), O(1), P(2), E(3), S(4) -> 
        R at 0 (new), E at 3 (new) -> okay.

 This seems good.

 ""rules"": 
   R(0), U(1), L(2), E(3), S(4) -> also okay.

 But U is less common.

 ""trees"": 
   T(0), R(1), E(2), E(3), S(4) -> 
        R is at index1 -> same as before -> avoid. Also, duplicate E? We don't know if the word has two E's.

 We don't have information about duplicates, but we can try. However, R at index1 is bad.

 After considering, I think ""ropes"" is a good candidate because:
   - It uses common letters: R, O, P, E, S.
   - It places R at a new position (0) and E at a new position (3).
   - It tests O, P, S which are common.

 Alternatively, ""tires"" (with R at index2 and E at index3) is also good.

 But note: in ""tires"", we have:
   T at 0, I at 1, R at 2, E at 3, S at 4.

 We are testing T, I, S and also R and E.

 Since we have limited information, I think ""tires"" is a good choice.

 However, we must be cautious: the word might have the R at index0? We don't know. But we are testing R at index2 and E at index3.

 Another candidate: ""bries"" (if we want to test B) but B is less common.

 I think ""tires"" is a solid choice.

 Let me check if ""tires"" is a valid word: yes, it is (plural of tire, or to become weary).

 So I will go with ""tires"".

 But wait, we have another option: ""strep"" (if we consider it valid) is also good. However, ""strep"" might be less common.

 Alternatively, ""sower"": 
   S(0), O(1), W(2), E(3), R(4) -> 
        R is at index4 (new) and E at index3 (new). 
        But W is less common.

 I think ""tires"" is better.

 Final decision: ""tires""
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, A, N** are **absent** (x) → Exclude these letters.
- **R** is present but **not in position 1** (-).
- **E** is present but **not in position 4** (-).

For the next guess:
- Must include **R** and **E** in new positions (R not at index 1, E not at index 4).
- Avoid C, A, N.
- Test new common letters (e.g., T, I, S, O, L) to maximize information.

The word **""tires""** fits well:
- Places R at index 2 (new position).
- Places E at index 3 (new position).
- Tests new common letters: T, I, S.
- Excludes forbidden letters (C, A, N).

<thinking>
- Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-) → Secret word contains R and E, but not at positions 1 or 4. Letters C, A, N are absent.
- New guess must: 
  - Include R (not at position 1) and E (not at position 4).
  - Avoid C, A, N.
  - Prioritize untested common letters (e.g., T, I, S).
- ""tires"" satisfies:
  - R at index 2 (≠1), E at index 3 (≠4).
  - Tests T, I, S (high-frequency letters).
  - Valid 5-letter word without C, A, N.
- Alternatives considered: ""ropes"" (tests O, P, S) and ""strep"" (tests S, T, P), but ""tires"" tests more vowels (I) and common consonants.

 Another candidate: ""lures"" -> L, U, R, E, S -> U is less common.

 After considering, I think ""tires"" is a good choice because it tests T, I, S (common letters) and places R and E in new positions.

 However, we must note that the secret word might have the letter at the same position as in ""crane"" for other letters? But we don't have any correct position yet.

 Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has E and R and also uses other common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O.

 Let me try to form a word that has S, T, and/or O.

 Example: ""store"" -> S, T, O, R, E -> 
   positions: 
      S(0), T(1), O(2), R(3), E(4)
   But note: E is at index4, which is the same as in ""crane"" and we know that E is not at index4? 
   Because in ""crane"", E was at index4 and we got '-' meaning it is in the word but not at that position. 
   So we cannot put E at index4 again? Actually, we can, but it would be the same mistake. We know E is not at index4, so putting it there again would be a waste.

 Therefore, we must avoid putting E at index4 and R at index1.

 In ""store"", E is at index4 -> that's the same as before and we know it's wrong. So we avoid.

 How about ""strep"": 
   S(0), T(1), R(2), E(3), P(4) -> 
        R is at index2 (not 1) -> okay.
        E is at index3 (not 4) -> okay.

 But ""strep"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning an infection.

 Alternatively, ""strip"": 
   S(0), T(1), R(2), I(3), P(4) -> but this doesn't have E. We must include E because we know it's in the word.

 So we need to include E.

 Another idea: ""tried"": 
   T(0), R(1), I(2), E(3), D(4) -> 
        But R is at index1 -> that's the same position as in ""crane"" and we know it's wrong. So we avoid R at index1.

 Therefore, we cannot have R at index1.

 How about ""trope"": 
   T(0), R(1), O(2), P(3), E(4) -> 
        R is at index1 -> same as before -> avoid.
        E is at index4 -> same as before -> avoid.

 So that's bad.

 Let me try to put R at index0: 
   Words: ""robed"", ""ropes"", ""roped"", ""roses"", but we avoid A, C, N.

 ""ropes"": 
   R(0), O(1), P(2), E(3), S(4) -> 
        R at 0 (new), E at 3 (new) -> okay.

 This seems good.

 ""rules"": 
   R(0), U(1), L(2), E(3), S(4) -> also okay.

 But U is less common.

 ""trees"": 
   T(0), R(1), E(2), E(3), S(4) -> 
        R is at index1 -> same as before -> avoid. Also, duplicate E? We don't know if the word has two E's.

 We don't have information about duplicates, but we can try. However, R at index1 is bad.

 After considering, I think ""ropes"" is a good candidate because:
   - It uses common letters: R, O, P, E, S.
   - It places R at a new position (0) and E at a new position (3).
   - It tests O, P, S which are common.

 Alternatively, ""tires"" (with R at index2 and E at index3) is also good.

 But note: in ""tires"", we have:
   T at 0, I at 1, R at 2, E at 3, S at 4.

 We are testing T, I, S and also R and E.

 Since we have limited information, I think ""tires"" is a good choice.

 However, we must be cautious: the word might have the R at index0? We don't know. But we are testing R at index2 and E at index3.

 Another candidate: ""bries"" (if we want to test B) but B is less common.

 I think ""tires"" is a solid choice.

 Let me check if ""tires"" is a valid word: yes, it is (plural of tire, or to become weary).

 So I will go with ""tires"".

 But wait, we have another option: ""strep"" (if we consider it valid) is also good. However, ""strep"" might be less common.

 Alternatively, ""sower"": 
   S(0), O(1), W(2), E(3), R(4) -> 
        R is at index4 (new) and E at index3 (new). 
        But W is less common.

 I think ""tires"" is better.

 Final decision: ""tires""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, A, N** are **absent** (x) → Exclude these letters.
- **R** is present but **not in position 1** (-).
- **E** is present but **not in position 4** (-).

For the next guess:
- Must include **R** and **E** in new positions (R not at index 1, E not at index 4).
- Avoid C, A, N.
- Test new common letters (e.g., T, I, S, O, L) to maximize information.

The word **""tires""** fits well:
- Places R at index 2 (new position).
- Places E at index 3 (new position).
- Tests new common letters: T, I, S.
- Excludes forbidden letters (C, A, N).

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. Since it's the first guess, we don't have any previous feedback.
 We want to choose a word that can give us as much information as possible. Typically, a good starting word has:
 - Five distinct letters to cover more letters.
 - Common vowels and consonants to maximize the chance of hitting some letters.

 Some popular starting words are: CRANE, SLATE, TRACE, AUDIO, etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"". It has:
 C, R, A, N, E -> distinct letters, and it includes vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

 So, my first guess will be CRANE.<thinking>
We are just starting the game and have no prior feedback. For the first guess, I need to select a word that maximizes information gain. A strong starting word should:
- Use common letters to increase the chance of matching letters in the secret word
- Contain a mix of vowels and consonants
- Avoid repeating letters for broader coverage

Based on common Wordle strategies, words like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" are excellent openers because they cover frequent letters. I'll choose **""CRANE""** for this first guess. It includes:
- Vowels: A, E (two of the most common vowels)
- Consonants: C, R, N (high-frequency consonants)
- All letters are distinct

This guess will reveal information about the presence and positions of several key letters.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(x) -> C is not in the word.
 R(-) -> R is in the word but in the wrong position.
 A(x) -> A is not in the word.
 N(x) -> N is not in the word.
 E(-) -> E is in the word but in the wrong position.

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R was in position 2 (index 1) and E was in position 5 (index 4). So the correct positions for R and E are not 1 and 4 respectively.
 - The letters C, A, N are absent.

 We also know the word has 5 letters and must be a valid English word.

 For the next guess, we want to:
 1. Include R and E (since they are in the word) but in different positions.
 2. Avoid using C, A, N (since they are not in the word).
 3. Use other common letters to test.

 We have to consider the positions:
 - R cannot be in position 1 (since it was in position 1 in ""crane"" and got '-', meaning it's present but not there).
 - E cannot be in position 4 (since it was in position 4 in ""crane"" and got '-').

 Also, note that the word does not have C, A, N.

 Let's think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N.

 Some possibilities: 
 - We can try words with R in positions other than 1, and E in positions other than 4.

 Since R was in position 1 and was wrong, we can try R in position 0, 2, 3, or 4? But note: positions are 0-indexed? 
 In the feedback, the positions are:
   Position 0: C
   Position 1: R
   Position 2: A
   Position 3: N
   Position 4: E

 So R was at index 1, and E at index 4.

 We cannot put R at index 1 again? Actually, we can, but it would be the same position and we know it's wrong. So we should avoid putting R at index 1 and E at index 4.

 However, note that the feedback doesn't prevent R from being at index 1 if there are two R's? But we don't know if there are duplicates. Since we only have one R in the feedback, we assume at least one R. But the word might have two R's? We don't know.

 But the feedback for R was a single '-' at index 1. So if we put R at index 1 again, it would still be wrong. So we should avoid that.

 Similarly for E at index 4.

 Let's try to form a word:

 We need to use 5 letters. We know R and E must be in the word. We can use other letters that are common and not yet tested (and not C, A, N).

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, etc.

 We can try to put R in a new position, say index 0? But then we have to avoid the known absent letters.

 Example words:
 - ""robes"": 
   - R at index 0 (which is new) -> we hope it might be correct or at least test R in a new spot.
   - O: new letter
   - B: new letter
   - E at index 3 (which is not 4, so allowed) -> but note: E was at index 4 and was wrong, so index 3 is new.
   - S: new letter

 But we don't know if O, B, S are in the word.

 Alternatively, we can try to put E in a new position, and R in a new position.

 Another idea: since we have two letters to place (R and E) and we know they are not at positions 1 and 4 respectively, we can try:

 Let me list some words that have R and E, and without C, A, N.

 Possible words: 
   ""tiger"" -> T, I, G, E, R -> but note: R is at the end (index 4) and E is at index 3? 
        positions: 
          T(0), I(1), G(2), E(3), R(4)
        In our feedback, R was at index1 and was wrong. Now we put R at index4 -> that's a new position, so it's okay.
        E was at index4 and was wrong, now we put E at index3 -> that's a new position, so okay.

   But we must avoid A, C, N. ""tiger"" doesn't have them.

   However, we don't know if T, I, G are in the word.

   Let's check: 
        T: not tested -> we can test it.
        I: not tested.
        G: not tested.

   This seems a good candidate.

 Another word: ""power"" -> P, O, W, E, R -> R at index4, E at index3 -> same as above.

 But we have to consider that we have 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.

 We can also consider that we have two known letters (R and E) and we want to test other common letters.

 Let me think of words that include more common letters and avoid the absent ones.

 Common letters: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C (but A, C, N are out, so we have E, R, I, O, T, S, L).

 We already have E and R. So we can try to include T, O, I, S, L.

 For example, ""tires"": 
   T, I, R, E, S -> 
        T at 0, I at 1, R at 2, E at 3, S at 4.
        R is at index2 (which is not 1) -> okay.
        E is at index3 (which is not 4) -> okay.

 But note: we have to avoid A, C, N. ""tires"" doesn't have them.

 However, we are not sure if the word has T, I, S. This guess would test three new letters.

 Alternatively, ""rotes"": 
   R at 0, O at 1, T at 2, E at 3, S at 4.

 This also tests R at 0 and E at 3.

 But note: we have to be cautious because we don't know if the word has duplicate letters.

 Since we don't have any duplicate in the feedback, we assume no duplicates for now.

 Another candidate: ""lures"" -> L, U, R, E, S -> U is less common.

 After considering, I think ""tires"" is a good choice because it tests T, I, S (common letters) and places R and E in new positions.

 However, we must note that the secret word might have the letter at the same position as in ""crane"" for other letters? But we don't have any correct position yet.

 Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has E and R and also uses other common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O.

 Let me try to form a word that has S, T, and/or O.

 Example: ""store"" -> S, T, O, R, E -> 
   positions: 
      S(0), T(1), O(2), R(3), E(4)
   But note: E is at index4, which is the same as in ""crane"" and we know that E is not at index4? 
   Because in ""crane"", E was at index4 and we got '-' meaning it is in the word but not at that position. 
   So we cannot put E at index4 again? Actually, we can, but it would be the same mistake. We know E is not at index4, so putting it there again would be a waste.

 Therefore, we must avoid putting E at index4 and R at index1.

 In ""store"", E is at index4 -> that's the same as before and we know it's wrong. So we avoid.

 How about ""strep"": 
   S(0), T(1), R(2), E(3), P(4) -> 
        R is at index2 (not 1) -> okay.
        E is at index3 (not 4) -> okay.

 But ""strep"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning an infection.

 Alternatively, ""strip"": 
   S(0), T(1), R(2), I(3), P(4) -> but this doesn't have E. We must include E because we know it's in the word.

 So we need to include E.

 Another idea: ""tried"": 
   T(0), R(1), I(2), E(3), D(4) -> 
        But R is at index1 -> that's the same position as in ""crane"" and we know it's wrong. So we avoid R at index1.

 Therefore, we cannot have R at index1.

 How about ""trope"": 
   T(0), R(1), O(2), P(3), E(4) -> 
        R is at index1 -> same as before -> avoid.
        E is at index4 -> same as before -> avoid.

 So that's bad.

 Let me try to put R at index0: 
   Words: ""robed"", ""ropes"", ""roped"", ""roses"", but we avoid A, C, N.

 ""ropes"": 
   R(0), O(1), P(2), E(3), S(4) -> 
        R at 0 (new), E at 3 (new) -> okay.

 This seems good.

 ""rules"": 
   R(0), U(1), L(2), E(3), S(4) -> also okay.

 But U is less common.

 ""trees"": 
   T(0), R(1), E(2), E(3), S(4) -> 
        R is at index1 -> same as before -> avoid. Also, duplicate E? We don't know if the word has two E's.

 We don't have information about duplicates, but we can try. However, R at index1 is bad.

   - It uses common letters: R, O, P, E, S.
   - It places R at a new position (0) and E at a new position (3).
   - It tests O, P, S which are common.

 Alternatively, ""tires"" (with R at index2 and E at index3) is also good.

 But note: in ""tires"", we have:
   T at 0, I at 1, R at 2, E at 3, S at 4.

 We are testing T, I, S and also R and E.

 Since we have limited information, I think ""tires"" is a good choice.

 However, we must be cautious: the word might have the R at index0? We don't know. But we are testing R at index2 and E at index3.

 Another candidate: ""bries"" (if we want to test B) but B is less common.

 I think ""tires"" is a solid choice.

 Let me check if ""tires"" is a valid word: yes, it is (plural of tire, or to become weary).

 So I will go with ""tires"".

 But wait, we have another option: ""strep"" (if we consider it valid) is also good. However, ""strep"" might be less common.

 Alternatively, ""sower"": 
   S(0), O(1), W(2), E(3), R(4) -> 
        R is at index4 (new) and E at index3 (new). 
        But W is less common.

 I think ""tires"" is better.

 Final decision: ""tires""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, A, N** are **absent** (x) → Exclude these letters.
- **R** is present but **not in position 1** (-).
- **E** is present but **not in position 4** (-).

Now we put R at index4 -> that\'s a new position, so it\'s okay.\n        E was at index4 and was wrong, now we put E at index3 -> that\'s a new position, so okay.\n\n   But we must avoid A, C, N. ""tiger"" doesn\'t have them.\n\n   However, we don\'t know if T, I, G are in the word.\n\n   Let\'s check: \n        T: not tested -> we can test it.\n        I: not tested.\n        G: not tested.\n\n   This seems a good candidate.\n\n Another word: ""power"" -> P, O, W, E, R -> R at index4, E at index3 -> same as above.\n\n But we have to consider that we have 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.\n\n We can also consider that we have two known letters (R and E) and we want to test other common letters.\n\n Let me think of words that include more common letters and avoid the absent ones.\n\n Common letters: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C (but A, C, N are out, so we have E, R, I, O, T, S, L).\n\n We already have E and R. So we can try to include T, O, I, S, L.\n\n For example, ""tires"": \n   T, I, R, E, S -> \n        T at 0, I at 1, R at 2, E at 3, S at 4.\n        R is at index2 (which is not 1) -> okay.\n        E is at index3 (which is not 4) -> okay.\n\n But note: we have to avoid A, C, N. ""tires"" doesn\'t have them.\n\n However, we are not sure if the word has T, I, S. This guess would test three new letters.\n\n Alternatively, ""rotes"": \n   R at 0, O at 1, T at 2, E at 3, S at 4.\n\n This also tests R at 0 and E at 3.\n\n But note: we have to be cautious because we don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters.\n\n Since we don\'t have any duplicate in the feedback, we assume no duplicates for now.\n\n Another candidate: ""lures"" -> L, U, R, E, S -> U is less common.\n\n After considering, I think ""tires"" is a good choice because it tests T, I, S (common letters) and places R and E in new positions.\n\n However, we must note that the secret word might have the letter at the same position as in ""crane"" for other letters? But we don\'t have any correct position yet.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has E and R and also uses other common letters we haven\'t tried: S, T, L, O.\n\n Let me try to form a word that has S, T, and/or O.\n\n Example: ""store"" -> S, T, O, R, E -> \n   positions: \n      S(0), T(1), O(2), R(3), E(4)\n   But note: E is at index4, which is the same as in ""crane"" and we know that E is not at index4? \n   Because in ""crane"", E was at index4 and we got \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not at that position. \n   So we cannot put E at index4 again? Actually, we can, but it would be the same mistake. We know E is not at index4, so putting it there again would be a waste.\n\n Therefore, we must avoid putting E at index4 and R at index1.\n\n In ""store"", E is at index4 -> that\'s the same as before and we know it\'s wrong. So we avoid.\n\n How about ""strep"": \n   S(0), T(1), R(2), E(3), P(4) -> \n        R is at index2 (not 1) -> okay.\n        E is at index3 (not 4) -> okay.\n\n But ""strep"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning an infection.\n\n Alternatively, ""strip"": \n   S(0), T(1), R(2), I(3), P(4) -> but this doesn\'t have E. We must include E because we know it\'s in the word.\n\n So we need to include E.\n\n Another idea: ""tried"": \n   T(0), R(1), I(2), E(3), D(4) -> \n        But R is at index1 -> that\'s the same position as in ""crane"" and we know it\'s wrong. So we avoid R at index1.\n\n Therefore, we cannot have R at index1.\n\n How about ""trope"": \n   T(0), R(1), O(2), P(3), E(4) -> \n        R is at index1 -> same as before -> avoid.\n        E is at index4 -> same as before -> avoid.\n\n So that\'s bad.\n\n Let me try to put R at index0: \n   Words: ""robed"", ""ropes"", ""roped"", ""roses"", but we avoid A, C, N.\n\n ""ropes"": \n   R(0), O(1), P(2), E(3), S(4) -> \n        R at 0 (new), E at 3 (new) -> okay.\n\n This seems good.\n\n ""rules"": \n   R(0), U(1), L(2), E(3), S(4) -> also okay.\n\n But U is less common.\n\n ""trees"": \n   T(0), R(1), E(2), E(3), S(4) -> \n        R is at index1 -> same as before -> avoid. Also, duplicate E? We don\'t know if the word has two E\'s.\n\n We don\'t have information about duplicates, but we can try. However, R at index1 is bad.\n\n After considering, I think ""ropes"" is a good candidate because:\n   - It uses common letters: R, O, P, E, S.\n   - It places R at a new position (0) and E at a new position (3).\n   - It tests O, P, S which are common.\n\n Alternatively, ""tires"" (with R at index2 and E at index3) is also good.\n\n But note: in ""tires"", we have:\n   T at 0, I at 1, R at 2, E at 3, S at 4.\n\n We are testing T, I, S and also R and E.\n\n Since we have limited information, I think ""tires"" is a good choice.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the word might have the R at index0? We don\'t know. But we are testing R at index2 and E at index3.\n\n Another candidate: ""bries"" (if we want to test B) but B is less common.\n\n I think ""tires"" is a solid choice.\n\n Let me check if ""tires"" is a valid word: yes, it is (plural of tire, or to become weary).\n\n So I will go with ""tires"".\n\n But wait, we have another option: ""strep"" (if we consider it valid) is also good. However, ""strep"" might be less common.\n\n Alternatively, ""sower"": \n   S(0), O(1), W(2), E(3), R(4) -> \n        R is at index4 (new) and E at index3 (new). \n        But W is less common.\n\n I think ""tires"" is better.\n\n Final decision: ""tires""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C, A, N** are **absent** (x) → Exclude these letters.\n- **R** is present but **not in position 1** (-).\n- **E** is present but **not in position 4** (-).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **R** and **E** in new positions (R not at index 1, E not at index 4).\n- Avoid C, A, N.\n- Test new common letters (e.g., T, I, S, O, L) to maximize information.\n\nThe word **""tires""** fits well:\n- Places R at index 2 (new position).\n- Places E at index 3 (new position).\n- Tests new common letters: T, I, S.\n- Excludes forbidden letters (C, A, N).\n\n<thinking>\n- Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-) → Secret word contains R and E, but not at positions 1 or 4.

We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: absent (x)
  R: present, wrong position (-)
  A: absent (x)
  N: absent (x)
  E: present, wrong position (-)

Guess 2: ""tires""
  T: absent (x)
  I: absent (x)
  R: present, wrong position (-)
  E: correct position (✓) -> so E is in the word and at position 3 (index 3, since 0-indexed: positions 0,1,2,3,4)
  S: absent (x)

So, from both guesses, we know:

- The secret word has the letter E in the 4th position (index 3). Because in ""tires"", E was at index 3 and got ✓.
- The secret word has the letter R, but not at index 1 (from ""crane"") and not at index 2 (from ""tires"", since it was at index 2 and got '-', meaning it's present but not there).
- The secret word does not contain: C, A, N, T, I, S.

Also, from ""crane"", we know that E is not at index 4 (the last position) and R is not at index 1.

Now, let's list the knowns:

- Position 3 (the fourth letter) is E.

- R is in the word, but not at index 1 or 2.

- Absent letters: C, A, N, T, I, S.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, T, I, S.

We need to find a word that:
- Has E at position 3 (index 3).
- Contains R, but not at index 1 or 2 (so R must be at index 0, 3, or 4). But position 3 is E, so R cannot be at index 3. Therefore, R must be at index 0 or 4.
- Does not contain C, A, N, T, I, S.

We also need to fill the other positions (0,1,2,4) with letters that are not in the absent list.

Note: We have two positions for R: 0 or 4.

Let's think of common letters that are not excluded. The absent letters are: C, A, N, T, I, S.

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we also know the word must have R (at 0 or 4) and E (at 3).

We need to form a 5-letter word.

Let's consider the two cases:

Case 1: R is at position 0 (the first letter)
Then the word is: R _ _ E _

Case 2: R is at position 4 (the last letter)
Then the word is: _ _ _ E R

We need to fill the blanks with letters from the available set, and the word must be valid.

We also have to remember that from ""crane"", E was present but not at index 4. Now we have E at index 3, which is different. Also, R was present but not at index 1 (and now we are considering it at 0 or 4, which are different).

Now, let's try to think of words that fit.

First, if R is at 0: R _ _ E _

We need to fill positions 1, 2, and 4.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try common letters: L, O, P, M, D, etc.

Examples:
- R O L E ? -> but we need a letter at position 4. ""ROLEX"" is 5 letters? No, ""ROLEX"" is 5: R-O-L-E-X -> but X is not common. Also, we have to check if it's valid. ""ROLEX"" is a brand, but it might be accepted? However, let's think of more common words.

- ""ROPED"": but we have E at 3, so R O P E D -> but D is at 4. But we have to avoid A, C, N, T, I, S. D is allowed. However, we used P and O. But note: we don't know if O and P are in the word. But we can try.

But wait, we have to consider that we have only 4 guesses left (since we used 2). We want to maximize information.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has more common letters to test.

But note: we have many letters to test. We might need to focus on narrowing down.

Another idea: since we know E is at 3, and R is either at 0 or 4, we can try a word that puts R at 0 and uses common letters for the rest.

For example: 
  ""ROGUE"": 
    R at 0, O at 1, G at 2, U at 3? But position 3 must be E, not U. So invalid.

We must have E at 3.

So: R _ _ E _

Let me try: ""ROBED"": 
  R(0), O(1), B(2), E(3), D(4) -> but we have to avoid A, C, N, T, I, S. B, O, D are allowed.

But is ""ROBED"" a word? Yes.

But note: we don't know if O, B, D are in the word. This would test them.

Similarly, ""ROPED"": R(0), O(1), P(2), E(3), D(4) -> also valid.

But we have two possibilities for R: at 0 or 4. We don't know which. So if we guess a word with R at 0, and if it's wrong, then we know R must be at 4.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has R at 4 to test that case.

But we have to choose one.

We can also try to use a word that doesn't have R at all? But we know R is in the word, so we must include it. And we have to place it at 0 or 4.

But if we put R at 4, then the word is: _ _ _ E R

And we fill the first three positions.

For example: ""DIVER"": D(0), I(1) -> but I is absent! We cannot use I.

I is in the absent list.

Similarly, ""HOMER"": H(0), O(1), M(2), E(3), R(4) -> H, O, M are allowed.

""HOMER"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""BOXER"": B(0), O(1), X(2), E(3), R(4) -> X is allowed.

But we have to avoid S, T, I, etc. which we are.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test as many new letters as possible.

In ""ROPED"": tests R at 0, and O, P, D.
In ""HOMER"": tests H, O, M, and R at 4.

We also note that in ""crane"", we had E at 4 and it was wrong, so if we put R at 4, that's a new position for R, but we don't know if it's correct.

But we know E is at 3, so position 4 is free for R.

We have two cases, so we might need to choose a word that can help us distinguish.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R at 0 and also tests other common letters.

But note: we have many absent letters, so we should focus on the most common remaining letters.

Common letters left: O, L, D, U, M, P, etc.

We can try to use a word that has O, L, or D.

But we don't have much to go on.

Another idea: we know the word has E at 3 and R at either 0 or 4. We can try to guess a word that has R at 0 and then if it's wrong, we know it's at 4. But we have only 4 guesses left, so we can afford to test.

But we can also try to cover more ground.

Let me list possible words:

For R at 0:
  R O ? E ?  -> we need two letters: one at 2 and one at 4 (since 1 is O in this example). But we can vary.

  Words: 
    ROBE? -> but we need 5 letters. ""ROBES"" -> but S is absent. So not allowed.
    ROBED -> as above.
    ROPED -> as above.
    ROVED -> R(0), O(1), V(2), E(3), D(4) -> valid.
    RULED -> R(0), U(1), L(2), E(3), D(4) -> valid.

For R at 4:
  ? ? ? E R
  HOMER -> H(0), O(1), M(2), E(3), R(4)
  BOXER -> B(0), O(1), X(2), E(3), R(4)
  LOWER -> L(0), O(1), W(2), E(3), R(4) -> but W is less common.
  MOWER -> similar.
  POWER -> P(0), O(1), W(2), E(3), R(4) -> W again.

But note: we have not tested O, so it might be in the word or not.

We can choose a word that doesn't assume O is present, but we have to use some letters.

We need to maximize information. So we should use a word that has letters we haven't tried, and that are common.

Let's list the letters we haven't tried that are not absent: 
  B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Common ones: O, L, D, M, P, U, B, G, etc.

We can try to use a word that has O, L, and D, for example.

But we have to fit the pattern.

I think ""ROPED"" is a good candidate because:
  - It tests R at position 0 (if R is at 0, then we get a ✓ for R, and we can confirm).
  - It tests O, P, D.
  - It has E at 3 which we know is correct.

But if R is actually at 4, then in ""ROPED"", R at 0 would be absent? But we know R is in the word, so if we put R at 0 and it's not there, then we get '-' for R? Actually, no: if R is in the word but not at 0, then we get '-'. But we know R is in the word, so if we put it at 0 and it's not the correct position, we get '-', and then we know R must be at 4.

So ""ROPED"" would give us information about R's position.

Similarly, if we get feedback for R in ""ROPED"" as ✓, then we know R is at 0.

So I think ""ROPED"" is a good guess.

But let's check the feedback we would get in both cases:

Case 1: If the word has R at 0, then in ""ROPED"":
  R(0): ✓
  O(1): ? (if O is in the word and at 1, then ✓; if not, then x or -)
  P(2): ?
  E(3): ✓ (we know)
  D(4): ?

Case 2: If the word has R at 4, then in ""ROPED"":
  R(0): - (because R is in the word but at 4, not 0)
  O(1): ?
  P(2): ?
  E(3): ✓
  D(4): ? (and R is at 4, so D would be at 4? But the word has R at 4, so D would be absent? Unless the word has D elsewhere? But we don't know.)

But the feedback for R at 0 would be '-' meaning present but wrong position, and then we know R must be at 4.

So we can deduce.

Alternatively, we can use a word that doesn't have R at 0 or 4? But we must include R. And we know it must be at 0 or 4. So we have to put it at one of them.

We can put it at 4 to test that case.

For example, guess ""HOMER"":
  If R is at 4, then we get R(4): ✓, and then we know.
  If R is at 0, then we get R(4): absent? But we know R is in the word, so if we put it at 4 and it's not there, we get '-', meaning it's present but not at 4, so then it must be at 0.

So both ""ROPED"" (R at 0) and ""HOMER"" (R at 4) are symmetric.

But we have to choose one.

I think ""ROPED"" is a bit better because it uses more common letters (O, P, D) and avoids less common letters like H, M.

So I'll go with ""ROPED"".

But wait, we have to make sure we don't use absent letters. In ""ROPED"", we have R, O, P, E, D. None of these are in the absent list (C,A,N,T,I,S). So it's okay.

Therefore, the next guess is ""ROPED"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
1. **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
   - C (x): Absent  
   - R (-): Present, wrong position (not index 1)  
   - A (x): Absent  
   - N (x): Absent  
   - E (-): Present, wrong position (not index 4)  

2. **Guess 2: ""tires""**  
   - T (x): Absent  
   - I (x): Absent  
   - R (-): Present, wrong position (not index 2)  
   - E (✓): Correct position (index 3)  
   - S (x): Absent  

### Key Insights:
- **E is confirmed** at **position 3** (index 3).  
- **R is present** but **not at positions 1 or 2**. It must be at **position 0 or 4**.  
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, T, I, S (cannot be used).  
- **Untested common letters**: O, L, D, P, M, B, U (prioritize these).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Must include R** at position 0 or 4 (to test its location).  
- **E must stay at position 3**.  
- Use **new common letters** (e.g., O, P, D) to maximize information.  
- Avoid absent letters.  

### Why ""roped""?
- **R at position 0**: Tests if R belongs at the start.  
- **O, P, D**: New high-frequency letters (untested).  
- **E at position 3**: Confirmed correct.  
- If R is not at position 0, feedback will confirm it must be at position 4.  
- Word structure: `R ? ? E ?` → Fills gaps with O (position 1), P (position 2), D (position 4).  

<thinking>  
- **Feedback summary**:  
  - E is fixed at index 3.  
  - R is present but misplaced at indices 1 and 2 → must be at 0 or 4.  
  - Absent: C, A, N, T, I, S.  
- **New guess ""roped""**:  
  - Tests R at index 0 (if ✓, R is at 0; if -, R must be at 4).  
  - Tests O, P, D (common letters).  
  - Complies with all constraints.  
- **Alternatives considered**:  
  - ""HOMER"" (tests R at 4) but uses less common H/M.  
  - ""RULED"" (tests U/L) but U is less frequent than O/P.

So, from both guesses, we know:

- The secret word has the letter E in the 4th position (index 3). Because in ""tires"", E was at index 3 and got ✓.

Now, let's list the knowns:

- Position 3 (the fourth letter) is E.

- R is in the word, but not at index 1 or 2.

- Absent letters: C, A, N, T, I, S.

We need to find a word that:
- Has E at position 3 (index 3).
- Contains R, but not at index 1 or 2 (so R must be at index 0, 3, or 4). But position 3 is E, so R cannot be at index 3. Therefore, R must be at index 0 or 4.
- Does not contain C, A, N, T, I, S.

We also need to fill the other positions (0,1,2,4) with letters that are not in the absent list.

Note: We have two positions for R: 0 or 4.

Let's think of common letters that are not excluded. The absent letters are: C, A, N, T, I, S.

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we also know the word must have R (at 0 or 4) and E (at 3).

We need to form a 5-letter word.

Let's consider the two cases:

Case 1: R is at position 0 (the first letter)
Then the word is: R _ _ E _

Case 2: R is at position 4 (the last letter)
Then the word is: _ _ _ E R

We can try common letters: L, O, P, M, D, etc.

Examples:
- R O L E ? -> but we need a letter at position 4. ""ROLEX"" is 5 letters? No, ""ROLEX"" is 5: R-O-L-E-X -> but X is not common. Also, we have to check if it's valid. ""ROLEX"" is a brand, but it might be accepted? However, let's think of more common words.

- ""ROPED"": but we have E at 3, so R O P E D -> but D is at 4. But we have to avoid A, C, N, T, I, S. D is allowed. However, we used P and O. But note: we don't know if O and P are in the word. But we can try.

But wait, we have to consider that we have only 4 guesses left (since we used 2). We want to maximize information.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has more common letters to test.

But note: we have many letters to test. We might need to focus on narrowing down.

Another idea: since we know E is at 3, and R is either at 0 or 4, we can try a word that puts R at 0 and uses common letters for the rest.

For example: 
  ""ROGUE"": 
    R at 0, O at 1, G at 2, U at 3? But position 3 must be E, not U. So invalid.

We must have E at 3.

So: R _ _ E _

Let me try: ""ROBED"": 
  R(0), O(1), B(2), E(3), D(4) -> but we have to avoid A, C, N, T, I, S. B, O, D are allowed.

But is ""ROBED"" a word? Yes.

But note: we don't know if O, B, D are in the word. This would test them.

Similarly, ""ROPED"": R(0), O(1), P(2), E(3), D(4) -> also valid.

But we have two possibilities for R: at 0 or 4. We don't know which. So if we guess a word with R at 0, and if it's wrong, then we know R must be at 4.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has R at 4 to test that case.

But we have to choose one.

We can also try to use a word that doesn't have R at all? But we know R is in the word, so we must include it. And we have to place it at 0 or 4.

But if we put R at 4, then the word is: _ _ _ E R

And we fill the first three positions.

For example: ""DIVER"": D(0), I(1) -> but I is absent! We cannot use I.

I is in the absent list.

Similarly, ""HOMER"": H(0), O(1), M(2), E(3), R(4) -> H, O, M are allowed.

""HOMER"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""BOXER"": B(0), O(1), X(2), E(3), R(4) -> X is allowed.

But we have to avoid S, T, I, etc. which we are.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test as many new letters as possible.

In ""ROPED"": tests R at 0, and O, P, D.
In ""HOMER"": tests H, O, M, and R at 4.

We also note that in ""crane"", we had E at 4 and it was wrong, so if we put R at 4, that's a new position for R, but we don't know if it's correct.

But we know E is at 3, so position 4 is free for R.

We have two cases, so we might need to choose a word that can help us distinguish.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R at 0 and also tests other common letters.

But note: we have many absent letters, so we should focus on the most common remaining letters.

Common letters left: O, L, D, U, M, P, etc.

We can try to use a word that has O, L, or D.

But we don't have much to go on.

Another idea: we know the word has E at 3 and R at either 0 or 4. We can try to guess a word that has R at 0 and then if it's wrong, we know it's at 4. But we have only 4 guesses left, so we can afford to test.

But we can also try to cover more ground.

Let me list possible words:

For R at 0:
  R O ? E ?  -> we need two letters: one at 2 and one at 4 (since 1 is O in this example). But we can vary.

  Words: 
    ROBE? -> but we need 5 letters. ""ROBES"" -> but S is absent. So not allowed.
    ROBED -> as above.
    ROPED -> as above.
    ROVED -> R(0), O(1), V(2), E(3), D(4) -> valid.
    RULED -> R(0), U(1), L(2), E(3), D(4) -> valid.

For R at 4:
  ? ? ? E R
  HOMER -> H(0), O(1), M(2), E(3), R(4)
  BOXER -> B(0), O(1), X(2), E(3), R(4)
  LOWER -> L(0), O(1), W(2), E(3), R(4) -> but W is less common.
  MOWER -> similar.
  POWER -> P(0), O(1), W(2), E(3), R(4) -> W again.

But note: we have not tested O, so it might be in the word or not.

We can choose a word that doesn't assume O is present, but we have to use some letters.

We need to maximize information. So we should use a word that has letters we haven't tried, and that are common.

Let's list the letters we haven't tried that are not absent: 
  B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Common ones: O, L, D, M, P, U, B, G, etc.

We can try to use a word that has O, L, and D, for example.

But we have to fit the pattern.

I think ""ROPED"" is a good candidate because:
  - It tests R at position 0 (if R is at 0, then we get a ✓ for R, and we can confirm).
  - It tests O, P, D.
  - It has E at 3 which we know is correct.

But if R is actually at 4, then in ""ROPED"", R at 0 would be absent? But we know R is in the word, so if we put R at 0 and it's not there, then we get '-' for R? Actually, no: if R is in the word but not at 0, then we get '-'. But we know R is in the word, so if we put it at 0 and it's not the correct position, we get '-', and then we know R must be at 4.

So ""ROPED"" would give us information about R's position.

Similarly, if we get feedback for R in ""ROPED"" as ✓, then we know R is at 0.

So I think ""ROPED"" is a good guess.

But let's check the feedback we would get in both cases:

Case 1: If the word has R at 0, then in ""ROPED"":
  R(0): ✓
  O(1): ? (if O is in the word and at 1, then ✓; if not, then x or -)
  P(2): ?
  E(3): ✓ (we know)
  D(4): ?

Case 2: If the word has R at 4, then in ""ROPED"":
  R(0): - (because R is in the word but at 4, not 0)
  O(1): ?
  P(2): ?
  E(3): ✓
  D(4): ? (and R is at 4, so D would be at 4? But the word has R at 4, so D would be absent? Unless the word has D elsewhere? But we don't know.)

But the feedback for R at 0 would be '-' meaning present but wrong position, and then we know R must be at 4.

So we can deduce.

Alternatively, we can use a word that doesn't have R at 0 or 4? But we must include R. And we know it must be at 0 or 4. So we have to put it at one of them.

We can put it at 4 to test that case.

For example, guess ""HOMER"":
  If R is at 4, then we get R(4): ✓, and then we know.
  If R is at 0, then we get R(4): absent? But we know R is in the word, so if we put it at 4 and it's not there, we get '-', meaning it's present but not at 4, so then it must be at 0.

So both ""ROPED"" (R at 0) and ""HOMER"" (R at 4) are symmetric.

But we have to choose one.

I think ""ROPED"" is a bit better because it uses more common letters (O, P, D) and avoids less common letters like H, M.

So I'll go with ""ROPED"".

But wait, we have to make sure we don't use absent letters. In ""ROPED"", we have R, O, P, E, D. None of these are in the absent list (C,A,N,T,I,S). So it's okay.

Therefore, the next guess is ""ROPED"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
1. **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
   - C (x): Absent  
   - R (-): Present, wrong position (not index 1)  
   - A (x): Absent  
   - N (x): Absent  
   - E (-): Present, wrong position (not index 4)  

2. **Guess 2: ""tires""**  
   - T (x): Absent  
   - I (x): Absent  
   - R (-): Present, wrong position (not index 2)  
   - E (✓): Correct position (index 3)  
   - S (x): Absent  

### Key Insights:
- **E is confirmed** at **position 3** (index 3).  
- **R is present** but **not at positions 1 or 2**. It must be at **position 0 or 4**.  
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, T, I, S (cannot be used).  
- **Untested common letters**: O, L, D, P, M, B, U (prioritize these).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Must include R** at position 0 or 4 (to test its location).  
- **E must stay at position 3**.  
- Use **new common letters** (e.g., O, P, D) to maximize information.  
- Avoid absent letters.  

### Why ""roped""?
- **R at position 0**: Tests if R belongs at the start.  
- **O, P, D**: New high-frequency letters (untested).  
- **E at position 3**: Confirmed correct.  
- If R is not at position 0, feedback will confirm it must be at position 4.  
- Word structure: `R ? ? E ?` → Fills gaps with O (position 1), P (position 2), D (position 4).  

<thinking>  
- **Feedback summary**:  
  - E is fixed at index 3.  
  - R is present but misplaced at indices 1 and 2 → must be at 0 or 4.  
  - Absent: C, A, N, T, I, S.  
- **New guess ""roped""**:  
  - Tests R at index 0 (if ✓, R is at 0; if -, R must be at 4).  
  - Tests O, P, D (common letters).  
  - Complies with all constraints.  
- **Alternatives considered**:  
  - ""HOMER"" (tests R at 4) but uses less common H/M.  
  - ""RULED"" (tests U/L) but U is less frequent than O/P.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. Since it's the first guess, we don't have any previous feedback.
 We want to choose a word that can give us as much information as possible. Typically, a good starting word has:
 - Five distinct letters to cover more letters.
 - Common vowels and consonants to maximize the chance of hitting some letters.

 Some popular starting words are: CRANE, SLATE, TRACE, AUDIO, etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"". It has:
 C, R, A, N, E -> distinct letters, and it includes vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

 So, my first guess will be CRANE.<thinking>
We are just starting the game and have no prior feedback. For the first guess, I need to select a word that maximizes information gain. A strong starting word should:
- Use common letters to increase the chance of matching letters in the secret word
- Contain a mix of vowels and consonants
- Avoid repeating letters for broader coverage

Based on common Wordle strategies, words like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" are excellent openers because they cover frequent letters. I'll choose **""CRANE""** for this first guess. It includes:
- Vowels: A, E (two of the most common vowels)
- Consonants: C, R, N (high-frequency consonants)
- All letters are distinct

This guess will reveal information about the presence and positions of several key letters.
</thinking>

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(x) -> C is not in the word.
 R(-) -> R is in the word but in the wrong position.
 A(x) -> A is not in the word.
 N(x) -> N is not in the word.
 E(-) -> E is in the word but in the wrong position.

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R was in position 2 (index 1) and E was in position 5 (index 4). So the correct positions for R and E are not 1 and 4 respectively.
 - The letters C, A, N are absent.

 We also know the word has 5 letters and must be a valid English word.

 For the next guess, we want to:
 1. Include R and E (since they are in the word) but in different positions.
 2. Avoid using C, A, N (since they are not in the word).
 3. Use other common letters to test.

 We have to consider the positions:
 - R cannot be in position 1 (since it was in position 1 in ""crane"" and got '-', meaning it's present but not there).
 - E cannot be in position 4 (since it was in position 4 in ""crane"" and got '-').

 Also, note that the word does not have C, A, N.

 Let's think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N.

 Some possibilities: 
 - We can try words with R in positions other than 1, and E in positions other than 4.

 Since R was in position 1 and was wrong, we can try R in position 0, 2, 3, or 4? But note: positions are 0-indexed? 
 In the feedback, the positions are:
   Position 0: C
   Position 1: R
   Position 2: A
   Position 3: N
   Position 4: E

 So R was at index 1, and E at index 4.

 We cannot put R at index 1 again? Actually, we can, but it would be the same position and we know it's wrong. So we should avoid putting R at index 1 and E at index 4.

 However, note that the feedback doesn't prevent R from being at index 1 if there are two R's? But we don't know if there are duplicates. Since we only have one R in the feedback, we assume at least one R. But the word might have two R's? We don't know.

 But the feedback for R was a single '-' at index 1. So if we put R at index 1 again, it would still be wrong. So we should avoid that.

 Similarly for E at index 4.

 Let's try to form a word:

 We need to use 5 letters. We know R and E must be in the word. We can use other letters that are common and not yet tested (and not C, A, N).

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, etc.

 We can try to put R in a new position, say index 0? But then we have to avoid the known absent letters.

 Example words:
 - ""robes"": 
   - R at index 0 (which is new) -> we hope it might be correct or at least test R in a new spot.
   - O: new letter
   - B: new letter
   - E at index 3 (which is not 4, so allowed) -> but note: E was at index 4 and was wrong, so index 3 is new.
   - S: new letter

 But we don't know if O, B, S are in the word.

 Alternatively, we can try to put E in a new position, and R in a new position.

 Another idea: since we have two letters to place (R and E) and we know they are not at positions 1 and 4 respectively, we can try:

 Let me list some words that have R and E, and without C, A, N.

 Possible words: 
   ""tiger"" -> T, I, G, E, R -> but note: R is at the end (index 4) and E is at index 3? 
        positions: 
          T(0), I(1), G(2), E(3), R(4)
        In our feedback, R was at index1 and was wrong. Now we put R at index4 -> that's a new position, so it's okay.
        E was at index4 and was wrong, now we put E at index3 -> that's a new position, so okay.

   But we must avoid A, C, N. ""tiger"" doesn't have them.

   However, we don't know if T, I, G are in the word.

   Let's check: 
        T: not tested -> we can test it.
        I: not tested.
        G: not tested.

   This seems a good candidate.

 Another word: ""power"" -> P, O, W, E, R -> R at index4, E at index3 -> same as above.

 But we have to consider that we have 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.

 We can also consider that we have two known letters (R and E) and we want to test other common letters.

 Let me think of words that include more common letters and avoid the absent ones.

 Common letters: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C (but A, C, N are out, so we have E, R, I, O, T, S, L).

 We already have E and R. So we can try to include T, O, I, S, L.

 For example, ""tires"": 
   T, I, R, E, S -> 
        T at 0, I at 1, R at 2, E at 3, S at 4.
        R is at index2 (which is not 1) -> okay.
        E is at index3 (which is not 4) -> okay.

 But note: we have to avoid A, C, N. ""tires"" doesn't have them.

 However, we are not sure if the word has T, I, S. This guess would test three new letters.

 Alternatively, ""rotes"": 
   R at 0, O at 1, T at 2, E at 3, S at 4.

 This also tests R at 0 and E at 3.

 But note: we have to be cautious because we don't know if the word has duplicate letters.

 Since we don't have any duplicate in the feedback, we assume no duplicates for now.

 Another candidate: ""lures"" -> L, U, R, E, S -> U is less common.

 After considering, I think ""tires"" is a good choice because it tests T, I, S (common letters) and places R and E in new positions.

 However, we must note that the secret word might have the letter at the same position as in ""crane"" for other letters? But we don't have any correct position yet.

 Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has E and R and also uses other common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O.

 Let me try to form a word that has S, T, and/or O.

 Example: ""store"" -> S, T, O, R, E -> 
   positions: 
      S(0), T(1), O(2), R(3), E(4)
   But note: E is at index4, which is the same as in ""crane"" and we know that E is not at index4? 
   Because in ""crane"", E was at index4 and we got '-' meaning it is in the word but not at that position. 
   So we cannot put E at index4 again? Actually, we can, but it would be the same mistake. We know E is not at index4, so putting it there again would be a waste.

 Therefore, we must avoid putting E at index4 and R at index1.

 In ""store"", E is at index4 -> that's the same as before and we know it's wrong. So we avoid.

 How about ""strep"": 
   S(0), T(1), R(2), E(3), P(4) -> 
        R is at index2 (not 1) -> okay.
        E is at index3 (not 4) -> okay.

 But ""strep"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning an infection.

 Alternatively, ""strip"": 
   S(0), T(1), R(2), I(3), P(4) -> but this doesn't have E. We must include E because we know it's in the word.

 So we need to include E.

 Another idea: ""tried"": 
   T(0), R(1), I(2), E(3), D(4) -> 
        But R is at index1 -> that's the same position as in ""crane"" and we know it's wrong. So we avoid R at index1.

 Therefore, we cannot have R at index1.

 How about ""trope"": 
   T(0), R(1), O(2), P(3), E(4) -> 
        R is at index1 -> same as before -> avoid.
        E is at index4 -> same as before -> avoid.

 So that's bad.

 Let me try to put R at index0: 
   Words: ""robed"", ""ropes"", ""roped"", ""roses"", but we avoid A, C, N.

 ""ropes"": 
   R(0), O(1), P(2), E(3), S(4) -> 
        R at 0 (new), E at 3 (new) -> okay.

 This seems good.

 ""rules"": 
   R(0), U(1), L(2), E(3), S(4) -> also okay.

 But U is less common.

 ""trees"": 
   T(0), R(1), E(2), E(3), S(4) -> 
        R is at index1 -> same as before -> avoid. Also, duplicate E? We don't know if the word has two E's.

 We don't have information about duplicates, but we can try. However, R at index1 is bad.

 After considering, I think ""ropes"" is a good candidate because:
   - It uses common letters: R, O, P, E, S.
   - It places R at a new position (0) and E at a new position (3).
   - It tests O, P, S which are common.

 Alternatively, ""tires"" (with R at index2 and E at index3) is also good.

 But note: in ""tires"", we have:
   T at 0, I at 1, R at 2, E at 3, S at 4.

 We are testing T, I, S and also R and E.

 Since we have limited information, I think ""tires"" is a good choice.

 However, we must be cautious: the word might have the R at index0? We don't know. But we are testing R at index2 and E at index3.

 Another candidate: ""bries"" (if we want to test B) but B is less common.

 I think ""tires"" is a solid choice.

 Let me check if ""tires"" is a valid word: yes, it is (plural of tire, or to become weary).

 So I will go with ""tires"".

 But wait, we have another option: ""strep"" (if we consider it valid) is also good. However, ""strep"" might be less common.

 Alternatively, ""sower"": 
   S(0), O(1), W(2), E(3), R(4) -> 
        R is at index4 (new) and E at index3 (new). 
        But W is less common.

 I think ""tires"" is better.

 Final decision: ""tires""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, A, N** are **absent** (x) → Exclude these letters.
- **R** is present but **not in position 1** (-).
- **E** is present but **not in position 4** (-).

For the next guess:
- Must include **R** and **E** in new positions (R not at index 1, E not at index 4).
- Avoid C, A, N.
- Test new common letters (e.g., T, I, S, O, L) to maximize information.

The word **""tires""** fits well:
- Places R at index 2 (new position).
- Places E at index 3 (new position).
- Tests new common letters: T, I, S.
- Excludes forbidden letters (C, A, N).

<thinking>
- Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-) → Secret word contains R and E, but not at positions 1 or 4. Letters C, A, N are absent.
- New guess must: 
  - Include R (not at position 1) and E (not at position 4).
  - Avoid C, A, N.
  - Prioritize untested common letters (e.g., T, I, S).
- ""tires"" satisfies:
  - R at index 2 (≠1), E at index 3 (≠4).
  - Tests T, I, S (high-frequency letters).
  - Valid 5-letter word without C, A, N.
- Alternatives considered: ""ropes"" (tests O, P, S) and ""strep"" (tests S, T, P), but ""tires"" tests more vowels (I) and common consonants.

<guess>tires</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: tires -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) R(-) E(✓) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: absent (x)
  R: present, wrong position (-)
  A: absent (x)
  N: absent (x)
  E: present, wrong position (-)

Guess 2: ""tires""
  T: absent (x)
  I: absent (x)
  R: present, wrong position (-)
  E: correct position (✓) -> so E is in the word and at position 3 (index 3, since 0-indexed: positions 0,1,2,3,4)
  S: absent (x)

So, from both guesses, we know:

- The secret word has the letter E in the 4th position (index 3). Because in ""tires"", E was at index 3 and got ✓.
- The secret word has the letter R, but not at index 1 (from ""crane"") and not at index 2 (from ""tires"", since it was at index 2 and got '-', meaning it's present but not there).
- The secret word does not contain: C, A, N, T, I, S.

Also, from ""crane"", we know that E is not at index 4 (the last position) and R is not at index 1.

Now, let's list the knowns:

- Position 3 (the fourth letter) is E.

- R is in the word, but not at index 1 or 2.

- Absent letters: C, A, N, T, I, S.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, T, I, S.

We need to find a word that:
- Has E at position 3 (index 3).
- Contains R, but not at index 1 or 2 (so R must be at index 0, 3, or 4). But position 3 is E, so R cannot be at index 3. Therefore, R must be at index 0 or 4.
- Does not contain C, A, N, T, I, S.

We also need to fill the other positions (0,1,2,4) with letters that are not in the absent list.

Note: We have two positions for R: 0 or 4.

Let's think of common letters that are not excluded. The absent letters are: C, A, N, T, I, S.

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we also know the word must have R (at 0 or 4) and E (at 3).

We need to form a 5-letter word.

Let's consider the two cases:

Case 1: R is at position 0 (the first letter)
Then the word is: R _ _ E _

Case 2: R is at position 4 (the last letter)
Then the word is: _ _ _ E R

We need to fill the blanks with letters from the available set, and the word must be valid.

We also have to remember that from ""crane"", E was present but not at index 4. Now we have E at index 3, which is different. Also, R was present but not at index 1 (and now we are considering it at 0 or 4, which are different).

Now, let's try to think of words that fit.

First, if R is at 0: R _ _ E _

We need to fill positions 1, 2, and 4.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try common letters: L, O, P, M, D, etc.

Examples:
- R O L E ? -> but we need a letter at position 4. ""ROLEX"" is 5 letters? No, ""ROLEX"" is 5: R-O-L-E-X -> but X is not common. Also, we have to check if it's valid. ""ROLEX"" is a brand, but it might be accepted? However, let's think of more common words.

- ""ROPED"": but we have E at 3, so R O P E D -> but D is at 4. But we have to avoid A, C, N, T, I, S. D is allowed. However, we used P and O. But note: we don't know if O and P are in the word. But we can try.

But wait, we have to consider that we have only 4 guesses left (since we used 2). We want to maximize information.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has more common letters to test.

But note: we have many letters to test. We might need to focus on narrowing down.

Another idea: since we know E is at 3, and R is either at 0 or 4, we can try a word that puts R at 0 and uses common letters for the rest.

For example: 
  ""ROGUE"": 
    R at 0, O at 1, G at 2, U at 3? But position 3 must be E, not U. So invalid.

We must have E at 3.

So: R _ _ E _

Let me try: ""ROBED"": 
  R(0), O(1), B(2), E(3), D(4) -> but we have to avoid A, C, N, T, I, S. B, O, D are allowed.

But is ""ROBED"" a word? Yes.

But note: we don't know if O, B, D are in the word. This would test them.

Similarly, ""ROPED"": R(0), O(1), P(2), E(3), D(4) -> also valid.

But we have two possibilities for R: at 0 or 4. We don't know which. So if we guess a word with R at 0, and if it's wrong, then we know R must be at 4.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has R at 4 to test that case.

But we have to choose one.

We can also try to use a word that doesn't have R at all? But we know R is in the word, so we must include it. And we have to place it at 0 or 4.

But if we put R at 4, then the word is: _ _ _ E R

And we fill the first three positions.

For example: ""DIVER"": D(0), I(1) -> but I is absent! We cannot use I.

I is in the absent list.

Similarly, ""HOMER"": H(0), O(1), M(2), E(3), R(4) -> H, O, M are allowed.

""HOMER"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""BOXER"": B(0), O(1), X(2), E(3), R(4) -> X is allowed.

But we have to avoid S, T, I, etc. which we are.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test as many new letters as possible.

In ""ROPED"": tests R at 0, and O, P, D.
In ""HOMER"": tests H, O, M, and R at 4.

We also note that in ""crane"", we had E at 4 and it was wrong, so if we put R at 4, that's a new position for R, but we don't know if it's correct.

But we know E is at 3, so position 4 is free for R.

We have two cases, so we might need to choose a word that can help us distinguish.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R at 0 and also tests other common letters.

But note: we have many absent letters, so we should focus on the most common remaining letters.

Common letters left: O, L, D, U, M, P, etc.

We can try to use a word that has O, L, or D.

But we don't have much to go on.

Another idea: we know the word has E at 3 and R at either 0 or 4. We can try to guess a word that has R at 0 and then if it's wrong, we know it's at 4. But we have only 4 guesses left, so we can afford to test.

But we can also try to cover more ground.

Let me list possible words:

For R at 0:
  R O ? E ?  -> we need two letters: one at 2 and one at 4 (since 1 is O in this example). But we can vary.

  Words: 
    ROBE? -> but we need 5 letters. ""ROBES"" -> but S is absent. So not allowed.
    ROBED -> as above.
    ROPED -> as above.
    ROVED -> R(0), O(1), V(2), E(3), D(4) -> valid.
    RULED -> R(0), U(1), L(2), E(3), D(4) -> valid.

For R at 4:
  ? ? ? E R
  HOMER -> H(0), O(1), M(2), E(3), R(4)
  BOXER -> B(0), O(1), X(2), E(3), R(4)
  LOWER -> L(0), O(1), W(2), E(3), R(4) -> but W is less common.
  MOWER -> similar.
  POWER -> P(0), O(1), W(2), E(3), R(4) -> W again.

But note: we have not tested O, so it might be in the word or not.

We can choose a word that doesn't assume O is present, but we have to use some letters.

We need to maximize information. So we should use a word that has letters we haven't tried, and that are common.

Let's list the letters we haven't tried that are not absent: 
  B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Common ones: O, L, D, M, P, U, B, G, etc.

We can try to use a word that has O, L, and D, for example.

But we have to fit the pattern.

I think ""ROPED"" is a good candidate because:
  - It tests R at position 0 (if R is at 0, then we get a ✓ for R, and we can confirm).
  - It tests O, P, D.
  - It has E at 3 which we know is correct.

But if R is actually at 4, then in ""ROPED"", R at 0 would be absent? But we know R is in the word, so if we put R at 0 and it's not there, then we get '-' for R? Actually, no: if R is in the word but not at 0, then we get '-'. But we know R is in the word, so if we put it at 0 and it's not the correct position, we get '-', and then we know R must be at 4.

So ""ROPED"" would give us information about R's position.

Similarly, if we get feedback for R in ""ROPED"" as ✓, then we know R is at 0.

So I think ""ROPED"" is a good guess.

But let's check the feedback we would get in both cases:

Case 1: If the word has R at 0, then in ""ROPED"":
  R(0): ✓
  O(1): ? (if O is in the word and at 1, then ✓; if not, then x or -)
  P(2): ?
  E(3): ✓ (we know)
  D(4): ?

Case 2: If the word has R at 4, then in ""ROPED"":
  R(0): - (because R is in the word but at 4, not 0)
  O(1): ?
  P(2): ?
  E(3): ✓
  D(4): ? (and R is at 4, so D would be at 4? But the word has R at 4, so D would be absent? Unless the word has D elsewhere? But we don't know.)

But the feedback for R at 0 would be '-' meaning present but wrong position, and then we know R must be at 4.

So we can deduce.

Alternatively, we can use a word that doesn't have R at 0 or 4? But we must include R. And we know it must be at 0 or 4. So we have to put it at one of them.

We can put it at 4 to test that case.

For example, guess ""HOMER"":
  If R is at 4, then we get R(4): ✓, and then we know.
  If R is at 0, then we get R(4): absent? But we know R is in the word, so if we put it at 4 and it's not there, we get '-', meaning it's present but not at 4, so then it must be at 0.

So both ""ROPED"" (R at 0) and ""HOMER"" (R at 4) are symmetric.

But we have to choose one.

I think ""ROPED"" is a bit better because it uses more common letters (O, P, D) and avoids less common letters like H, M.

So I'll go with ""ROPED"".

But wait, we have to make sure we don't use absent letters. In ""ROPED"", we have R, O, P, E, D. None of these are in the absent list (C,A,N,T,I,S). So it's okay.

Therefore, the next guess is ""ROPED"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
1. **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
   - C (x): Absent  
   - R (-): Present, wrong position (not index 1)  
   - A (x): Absent  
   - N (x): Absent  
   - E (-): Present, wrong position (not index 4)  

2. **Guess 2: ""tires""**  
   - T (x): Absent  
   - I (x): Absent  
   - R (-): Present, wrong position (not index 2)  
   - E (✓): Correct position (index 3)  
   - S (x): Absent  

### Key Insights:
- **E is confirmed** at **position 3** (index 3).  
- **R is present** but **not at positions 1 or 2**. It must be at **position 0 or 4**.  
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, T, I, S (cannot be used).  
- **Untested common letters**: O, L, D, P, M, B, U (prioritize these).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Must include R** at position 0 or 4 (to test its location).  
- **E must stay at position 3**.  
- Use **new common letters** (e.g., O, P, D) to maximize information.  
- Avoid absent letters.  

### Why ""roped""?
- **R at position 0**: Tests if R belongs at the start.  
- **O, P, D**: New high-frequency letters (untested).  
- **E at position 3**: Confirmed correct.  
- If R is not at position 0, feedback will confirm it must be at position 4.  
- Word structure: `R ? ? E ?` → Fills gaps with O (position 1), P (position 2), D (position 4).  

<thinking>  
- **Feedback summary**:  
  - E is fixed at index 3.  
  - R is present but misplaced at indices 1 and 2 → must be at 0 or 4.  
  - Absent: C, A, N, T, I, S.  
- **New guess ""roped""**:  
  - Tests R at index 0 (if ✓, R is at 0; if -, R must be at 4).  
  - Tests O, P, D (common letters).  
  - Complies with all constraints.  
- **Alternatives considered**:  
  - ""HOMER"" (tests R at 4) but uses less common H/M.  
  - ""RULED"" (tests U/L) but U is less frequent than O/P.

But note: positions are 0-indexed? \n In the feedback, the positions are:\n   Position 0: C\n   Position 1: R\n   Position 2: A\n   Position 3: N\n   Position 4: E\n\n So R was at index 1, and E at index 4.\n\n We cannot put R at index 1 again?

But we don\'t know if there are duplicates. Since we only have one R in the feedback, we assume at least one R. But the word might have two R\'s? We don\'t know.\n\n But the feedback for R was a single \'-\' at index 1. So if we put R at index 1 again, it would still be wrong. So we should avoid that.\n\n Similarly for E at index 4.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word:\n\n We need to use 5 letters. We know R and E must be in the word. We can use other letters that are common and not yet tested (and not C, A, N).\n\n Common letters we haven\'t tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, etc.\n\n We can try to put R in a new position, say index 0?

""tiger"" doesn\'t have them.\n\n   However, we don\'t know if T, I, G are in the word.\n\n   Let\'s check: \n        T: not tested -> we can test it.\n        I: not tested.\n        G: not tested.\n\n   This seems a good candidate.\n\n Another word: ""power"" -> P, O, W, E, R -> R at index4, E at index3 -> same as above.\n\n But we have to consider that we have 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.\n\n We can also consider that we have two known letters (R and E) and we want to test other common letters.\n\n Let me think of words that include more common letters and avoid the absent ones.\n\n Common letters: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C (but A, C, N are out, so we have E, R, I, O, T, S, L).\n\n We already have E and R. So we can try to include T, O, I, S, L.\n\n For example, ""tires"": \n   T, I, R, E, S -> \n        T at 0, I at 1, R at 2, E at 3, S at 4.\n        R is at index2 (which is not 1) -> okay.\n        E is at index3 (which is not 4) -> okay.\n\n But note: we have to avoid A, C, N. ""tires"" doesn\'t have them.\n\n However, we are not sure if the word has T, I, S. This guess would test three new letters.\n\n Alternatively, ""rotes"": \n   R at 0, O at 1, T at 2, E at 3, S at 4.\n\n This also tests R at 0 and E at 3.\n\n But note: we have to be cautious because we don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters.\n\n Since we don\'t have any duplicate in the feedback, we assume no duplicates for now.\n\n Another candidate: ""lures"" -> L, U, R, E, S -> U is less common.\n\n After considering, I think ""tires"" is a good choice because it tests T, I, S (common letters) and places R and E in new positions.\n\n However, we must note that the secret word might have the letter at the same position as in ""crane"" for other letters? But we don\'t have any correct position yet.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has E and R and also uses other common letters we haven\'t tried: S, T, L, O.\n\n Let me try to form a word that has S, T, and/or O.\n\n Example: ""store"" -> S, T, O, R, E -> \n   positions: \n      S(0), T(1), O(2), R(3), E(4)\n   But note: E is at index4, which is the same as in ""crane"" and we know that E is not at index4? \n   Because in ""crane"", E was at index4 and we got \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not at that position. \n   So we cannot put E at index4 again? Actually, we can, but it would be the same mistake. We know E is not at index4, so putting it there again would be a waste.\n\n Therefore, we must avoid putting E at index4 and R at index1.\n\n In ""store"", E is at index4 -> that\'s the same as before and we know it\'s wrong. So we avoid.\n\n How about ""strep"": \n   S(0), T(1), R(2), E(3), P(4) -> \n        R is at index2 (not 1) -> okay.\n        E is at index3 (not 4) -> okay.\n\n But ""strep"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning an infection.\n\n Alternatively, ""strip"": \n   S(0), T(1), R(2), I(3), P(4) -> but this doesn\'t have E. We must include E because we know it\'s in the word.\n\n So we need to include E.\n\n Another idea: ""tried"": \n   T(0), R(1), I(2), E(3), D(4) -> \n        But R is at index1 -> that\'s the same position as in ""crane"" and we know it\'s wrong. So we avoid R at index1.\n\n Therefore, we cannot have R at index1.\n\n How about ""trope"": \n   T(0), R(1), O(2), P(3), E(4) -> \n        R is at index1 -> same as before -> avoid.\n        E is at index4 -> same as before -> avoid.\n\n So that\'s bad.\n\n Let me try to put R at index0: \n   Words: ""robed"", ""ropes"", ""roped"", ""roses"", but we avoid A, C, N.\n\n ""ropes"": \n   R(0), O(1), P(2), E(3), S(4) -> \n        R at 0 (new), E at 3 (new) -> okay.\n\n This seems good.\n\n ""rules"": \n   R(0), U(1), L(2), E(3), S(4) -> also okay.\n\n But U is less common.\n\n ""trees"": \n   T(0), R(1), E(2), E(3), S(4) -> \n        R is at index1 -> same as before -> avoid. Also, duplicate E? We don\'t know if the word has two E\'s.\n\n We don\'t have information about duplicates, but we can try. However, R at index1 is bad.\n\n After considering, I think ""ropes"" is a good candidate because:\n   - It uses common letters: R, O, P, E, S.\n   - It places R at a new position (0) and E at a new position (3).\n   - It tests O, P, S which are common.\n\n Alternatively, ""tires"" (with R at index2 and E at index3) is also good.\n\n But note: in ""tires"", we have:\n   T at 0, I at 1, R at 2, E at 3, S at 4.\n\n We are testing T, I, S and also R and E.\n\n Since we have limited information, I think ""tires"" is a good choice.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the word might have the R at index0? We don\'t know.

But position 3 is E, so R cannot be at index 3. Therefore, R must be at index 0 or 4.\n- Does not contain C, A, N, T, I, S.\n\nWe also need to fill the other positions (0,1,2,4) with letters that are not in the absent list.\n\nNote: We have two positions for R: 0 or 4.\n\nLet\'s think of common letters that are not excluded. The absent letters are: C, A, N, T, I, S.\n\nSo available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we also know the word must have R (at 0 or 4) and E (at 3).\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word.\n\nLet\'s consider the two cases:\n\nCase 1: R is at position 0 (the first letter)\nThen the word is: R _ _ E _\n\nCase 2: R is at position 4 (the last letter)\nThen the word is: _ _ _ E R\n\nWe need to fill the blanks with letters from the available set, and the word must be valid.\n\nWe also have to remember that from ""crane"", E was present but not at index 4. Now we have E at index 3, which is different. Also, R was present but not at index 1 (and now we are considering it at 0 or 4, which are different).\n\nNow, let\'s try to think of words that fit.\n\nFirst, if R is at 0: R _ _ E _\n\nWe need to fill positions 1, 2, and 4.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe can try common letters: L, O, P, M, D, etc.\n\nExamples:\n- R O L E ? -> but we need a letter at position 4. ""ROLEX"" is 5 letters? No, ""ROLEX"" is 5: R-O-L-E-X -> but X is not common. Also, we have to check if it\'s valid. ""ROLEX"" is a brand, but it might be accepted? However, let\'s think of more common words.\n\n- ""ROPED"": but we have E at 3, so R O P E D -> but D is at 4. But we have to avoid A, C, N, T, I, S. D is allowed. However, we used P and O. But note: we don\'t know if O and P are in the word. But we can try.\n\nBut wait, we have to consider that we have only 4 guesses left (since we used 2). We want to maximize information.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to use a word that has more common letters to test.\n\nBut note: we have many letters to test. We might need to focus on narrowing down.\n\nAnother idea: since we know E is at 3, and R is either at 0 or 4, we can try a word that puts R at 0 and uses common letters for the rest.\n\nFor example: \n  ""ROGUE"": \n    R at 0, O at 1, G at 2, U at 3? But position 3 must be E, not U. So invalid.\n\nWe must have E at 3.\n\nSo: R _ _ E _\n\nLet me try: ""ROBED"": \n  R(0), O(1), B(2), E(3), D(4) -> but we have to avoid A, C, N, T, I, S. B, O, D are allowed.\n\nBut is ""ROBED"" a word? Yes.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if O, B, D are in the word. This would test them.\n\nSimilarly, ""ROPED"": R(0), O(1), P(2), E(3), D(4) -> also valid.\n\nBut we have two possibilities for R: at 0 or 4. We don\'t know which. So if we guess a word with R at 0, and if it\'s wrong, then we know R must be at 4.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has R at 4 to test that case.\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nWe can also try to use a word that doesn\'t have R at all? But we know R is in the word, so we must include it. And we have to place it at 0 or 4.\n\nBut if we put R at 4, then the word is: _ _ _ E R\n\nAnd we fill the first three positions.\n\nFor example: ""DIVER"": D(0), I(1) -> but I is absent! We cannot use I.\n\nI is in the absent list.\n\nSimilarly, ""HOMER"": H(0), O(1), M(2), E(3), R(4) -> H, O, M are allowed.\n\n""HOMER"" is a valid word.\n\nSimilarly, ""BOXER"": B(0), O(1), X(2), E(3), R(4) -> X is allowed.\n\nBut we have to avoid S, T, I, etc. which we are.\n\nNow, which one to choose? We want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nIn ""ROPED"": tests R at 0, and O, P, D.\nIn ""HOMER"": tests H, O, M, and R at 4.\n\nWe also note that in ""crane"", we had E at 4 and it was wrong, so if we put R at 4, that\'s a new position for R, but we don\'t know if it\'s correct.\n\nBut we know E is at 3, so position 4 is free for R.\n\nWe have two cases, so we might need to choose a word that can help us distinguish.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has R at 0 and also tests other common letters.\n\nBut note: we have many absent letters, so we should focus on the most common remaining letters.\n\nCommon letters left: O, L, D, U, M, P, etc.\n\nWe can try to use a word that has O, L, or D.\n\nBut we don\'t have much to go on.\n\nAnother idea: we know the word has E at 3 and R at either 0 or 4. We can try to guess a word that has R at 0 and then if it\'s wrong, we know it\'s at 4. But we have only 4 guesses left, so we can afford to test.\n\nBut we can also try to cover more ground.\n\nLet me list possible words:\n\nFor R at 0:\n  R O ? E ?  -> we need two letters: one at 2 and one at 4 (since 1 is O in this example). But we can vary.\n\n  Words: \n    ROBE? -> but we need 5 letters. ""ROBES"" -> but S is absent. So not allowed.\n    ROBED -> as above.\n    ROPED -> as above.\n    ROVED -> R(0), O(1), V(2), E(3), D(4) -> valid.\n    RULED -> R(0), U(1), L(2), E(3), D(4) -> valid.\n\nFor R at 4:\n  ? ? ? E R\n  HOMER -> H(0), O(1), M(2), E(3), R(4)\n  BOXER -> B(0), O(1), X(2), E(3), R(4)\n  LOWER -> L(0), O(1), W(2), E(3), R(4) -> but W is less common.\n  MOWER -> similar.\n  POWER -> P(0), O(1), W(2), E(3), R(4) -> W again.\n\nBut note: we have not tested O, so it might be in the word or not.\n\nWe can choose a word that doesn\'t assume O is present, but we have to use some letters.\n\nWe need to maximize information. So we should use a word that has letters we haven\'t tried, and that are common.\n\nLet\'s list the letters we haven\'t tried that are not absent: \n  B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nCommon ones: O, L, D, M, P, U, B, G, etc.\n\nWe can try to use a word that has O, L, and D, for example.\n\nBut we have to fit the pattern.\n\nI think ""ROPED"" is a good candidate because:\n  - It tests R at position 0 (if R is at 0, then we get a ✓ for R, and we can confirm).\n  - It tests O, P, D.\n  - It has E at 3 which we know is correct.\n\nBut if R is actually at 4, then in ""ROPED"", R at 0 would be absent? But we know R is in the word, so if we put R at 0 and it\'s not there, then we get \'-\' for R? Actually, no: if R is in the word but not at 0, then we get \'-\'. But we know R is in the word, so if we put it at 0 and it\'s not the correct position, we get \'-\', and then we know R must be at 4.\n\nSo ""ROPED"" would give us information about R\'s position.\n\nSimilarly, if we get feedback for R in ""ROPED"" as ✓, then we know R is at 0.\n\nSo I think ""ROPED"" is a good guess.\n\nBut let\'s check the feedback we would get in both cases:\n\nCase 1: If the word has R at 0, then in ""ROPED"":\n  R(0): ✓\n  O(1): ? (if O is in the word and at 1, then ✓; if not, then x or -)\n  P(2): ?\n  E(3): ✓ (we know)\n  D(4): ?\n\nCase 2: If the word has R at 4, then in ""ROPED"":\n  R(0): - (because R is in the word but at 4, not 0)\n  O(1): ?\n  P(2): ?\n  E(3): ✓\n  D(4): ? (and R is at 4, so D would be at 4? But the word has R at 4, so D would be absent? Unless the word has D elsewhere? But we don\'t know.)\n\nBut the feedback for R at 0 would be \'-\' meaning present but wrong position, and then we know R must be at 4.\n\nSo we can deduce.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that doesn\'t have R at 0 or 4? But we must include R. And we know it must be at 0 or 4. So we have to put it at one of them.\n\nWe can put it at 4 to test that case.\n\nFor example, guess ""HOMER"":\n  If R is at 4, then we get R(4): ✓, and then we know.\n  If R is at 0, then we get R(4): absent? But we know R is in the word, so if we put it at 4 and it\'s not there, we get \'-\', meaning it\'s present but not at 4, so then it must be at 0.\n\nSo both ""ROPED"" (R at 0) and ""HOMER"" (R at 4) are symmetric.\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nI think ""ROPED"" is a bit better because it uses more common letters (O, P, D) and avoids less common letters like H, M.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""ROPED"".\n\nBut wait, we have to make sure we don\'t use absent letters. In ""ROPED"", we have R, O, P, E, D. None of these are in the absent list (C,A,N,T,I,S). So it\'s okay.\n\nTherefore, the next guess is ""ROPED"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n1. **Guess 1: ""crane""**  \n   - C (x): Absent  \n   - R (-): Present, wrong position (not index 1)  \n   - A (x): Absent  \n   - N (x): Absent  \n   - E (-): Present, wrong position (not index 4)  \n\n2. **Guess 2: ""tires""**  \n   - T (x): Absent  \n   - I (x): Absent  \n   - R (-): Present, wrong position (not index 2)  \n   - E (✓): Correct position (index 3)  \n   - S (x): Absent  \n\n### Key Insights:\n- **E is confirmed** at **position 3** (index 3).  \n- **R is present** but **not at positions 1 or 2**.

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: absent (x)
  R: present, wrong position (-) -> so R is in the word, but not at position 1 (index 1)
  A: absent (x)
  N: absent (x)
  E: present, wrong position (-) -> E is in the word, but not at position 4 (index 4)

Guess 2: ""tires""
  T: absent (x)
  I: absent (x)
  R: present, wrong position (-) -> R is in the word, but not at position 2 (index 2)
  E: correct position (✓) -> E is at position 3 (index 3)
  S: absent (x)

Guess 3: ""roped""
  R: correct position (✓) -> R is at position 0 (index 0)
  O: correct position (✓) -> O is at position 1 (index 1)
  P: absent (x)
  E: correct position (✓) -> E is at position 3 (index 3) (already known)
  D: absent (x)

So now we know:
- The word has R at index 0, O at index 1, and E at index 3.
- The letters C, A, N, T, I, S, P, D are absent.
- We have to fill the remaining positions: index 2 and index 4.

The word structure is: R O _ E _

We know the word has R, O, E, and two more letters that are not in the absent list.

Absent letters: C, A, N, T, I, S, P, D.

So available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly others, but these are the common ones).

We need to find a 5-letter word that fits: R O ? E ? 

And the two missing letters must be from the available set.

We also know that the word does not contain any of the absent letters.

Let's think of common words that start with ""RO"" and have ""E"" at the fourth position.

Possible words:
- R O L E X -> but X is the last letter. However, we have to check if L is allowed. L is not in the absent list, so it's allowed. But we have to check the feedback for the third guess: we have P and D absent, but L hasn't been tested.

But note: in ""roped"", we only know about R, O, P, E, D. We don't know about L.

So ""ROLEX"" is a brand, but it might be accepted? However, let's see if there are more common words.

- R O B E ? -> but B was not tested, but we have ""ROBES"" which has S (absent) and we need 5 letters. ""ROBED"" has D (absent). So not possible.

- R O M E O -> 5 letters? R O M E O -> positions: 0:R, 1:O, 2:M, 3:E, 4:O -> but O is repeated? We don't know if the word allows duplicates. But in our feedback, we haven't seen any duplicate yet. However, it's possible.

But let's check the feedback: in ""roped"", we have O at index1 and it was correct, but if the word has O at index4, that would be a duplicate. We don't have information about duplicates, so it's possible.

But ""ROMEO"" has two O's. And M is not in the absent list.

So ""ROMEO"" is a possibility.

- R O G U E -> R(0), O(1), G(2), U(3) -> but we need E at index3, not U. So invalid.

- R O L E S -> but S is absent.

- R O V E R -> R(0), O(1), V(2), E(3), R(4) -> duplicate R? But we know R is at index0, so if there's another R at index4, that's possible. And V is allowed.

""ROVER"" is a valid word.

- R O W E R -> W is allowed, but ""ROWER"" has two R's and two E's? R O W E R: positions: 0:R, 1:O, 2:W, 3:E, 4:R -> duplicate R.

- R O B E R T -> too long.

- R O L E D -> D is absent.

- R O M E S -> S absent.

- R O G E R -> R(0), O(1), G(2), E(3), R(4) -> duplicate R. ""ROGER"" is a word.

- R O L E K -> not a word.

So the common words I can think of are: ""ROMEO"", ""ROVER"", ""ROGER"".

Now, we have to check which of these fit the feedback.

First, we know from guess 1: E was present but not at index4. In ""ROMEO"", E is at index3 (which we know is correct) and the last letter is O. In ""ROVER"", last letter is R. In ""ROGER"", last letter is R.

Also, in guess 1, R was at index1 and was wrong. In ""ROMEO"", R is at index0 and index4? No, in ""ROMEO"", R is only at index0. The word is R-O-M-E-O, so the last letter is O, not R. So R is only at index0.

In ""ROVER"": R at index0 and index4.

In ""ROGER"": R at index0 and index4.

Now, from guess 1: we had R at index1 (in ""crane"") and it was present but wrong position. That means the word has at least one R, but not at index1. In ""ROMEO"", there is only one R (at index0), so that matches. In ""ROVER"" and ""ROGER"", there are two R's: one at index0 and one at index4. But the R at index0 is correct, and the R at index4 is additional. The feedback from guess1 only said R is present and not at index1, but it didn't say how many. So duplicates are allowed.

But in guess3, we have R at index0 correct, so if the word has another R, that's fine.

Now, we need to see if we can distinguish.

But we have to make a guess. We have two positions to fill: index2 and index4.

We know the word is R O ? E ?

The possibilities we have: 
- ""ROMEO"": ? at index2 is M, and index4 is O. But O is already used at index1. Is that allowed? Yes, but we don't know if O is duplicated.
- ""ROVER"": ? at index2 is V, index4 is R.
- ""ROGER"": ? at index2 is G, index4 is R.

We also have other words? Like ""ROUEN"" (but N is absent), ""ROTED"" (T and D absent), etc.

Another word: ""ROHEE"" ? Not common.

""ROKEE""? Not common.

""ROLEO""? Not a word.

So the main candidates are ""ROMEO"", ""ROVER"", ""ROGER"".

We need to choose one that tests new letters.

But note: we have to avoid P and D (from guess3), and the other absent letters.

In ""ROMEO"", we use M and O (O is already known, but we are using it again at the end). We haven't tested M.

In ""ROVER"", we use V and R (R is known, but we are using it again at the end). We haven't tested V.

In ""ROGER"", we use G and R (again, R at the end). We haven't tested G.

We can choose any of these, but we want to maximize the chance of being correct or getting information.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses a letter that is more common.

But V, G, M are all reasonable.

We can also consider that if we guess ""ROVER"" and it's wrong, we still have ""ROGER"" and ""ROMEO"" as possibilities.

But we have only 3 guesses left (after this one, 2 left? We've used 3, so 3 left? Wordle has 6 guesses total, so we have 3 more).

But we can try to guess one of them.

Another idea: we can use a word that doesn't assume the last letter is R or O, but uses a new letter at index4.

For example, ""ROLE"" is 4 letters, so we need 5. ""ROLES"" has S absent.

""ROTED"" has T and D absent.

""ROBED"" has D absent.

""ROPED"" we already tried.

""ROWED"" has D absent.

""ROUEN"" has N absent.

""ROACH"" has C and H? C is absent, H is allowed. But C is absent, so not.

So it's hard to find a word that doesn't end with R or O and uses allowed letters.

Therefore, we should guess one of the candidates.

I think ""ROVER"" is a good choice because V is a common letter? Or is it? Actually, V is less common than M or G? Let me check the frequency.

In English, G is more common than V and M? Actually, according to letter frequency:

E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, ... then C, M, F, W, Y, P, G, B, V, K, ...

So M is more common than G and V.

But we are not sure.

We can also consider that in ""ROMEO"", we are using O again. If the word has two O's, that might be less common? But possible.

But to get more information, we might want to test a new letter at index4.

But in all candidates, index4 is either O or R. We already know R and O are in the word, so if we put R or O at index4, we might not test a new letter.

But we have to fill the position.

Alternatively, we can try to guess ""ROMEO"" to test M and the duplicate O.

But let's see the feedback we would get.

If we guess ""ROVER"":
  R(0): ✓ (known)
  O(1): ✓ (known)
  V(2): ? 
  E(3): ✓ (known)
  R(4): ? 

If V is in the word and at index2, then ✓. If not, then x or -.

Similarly for ""ROGER"": G at index2.

But we don't have any information about V or G.

We can choose the most common word.

I think ""ROVER"" is a common word, and ""ROGER"" is also common. ""ROMEO"" is a name.

But all are valid.

Another word: ""ROTED"" is not allowed.

I think we should choose ""ROVER"" because it has V, which is less common, but if it's correct, we get it.

But to be safe, we can choose ""ROGER"" because G is more common? Actually, G is less common than M.

But let's look for the most frequent letters for position 2 and 4.

We don't have much data.

We can also consider that from the first guess, we had no information about duplicates, so duplicates are possible.

I think I'll go with ""ROVER"" because it's a common word.

But let's see the feedback from guess1: in ""crane"", we had R and E, and in ""tires"", we had R and E, and in ""roped"", we had R, O, E. So if the word has two R's, then in ""crane"", the R at index1 was not correct, but there might be another R. Similarly in ""tires"", R at index2 was not correct, but there might be another R at index0 or index4.

In ""ROVER"", we have two R's: one at 0 (which we know is correct) and one at 4. So the R at index4 is new.

Similarly, in ""ROGER"", two R's.

In ""ROMEO"", only one R and two O's.

Now, we have to choose.

But we have a correct R at 0, so if we put R at 4, we are testing if there is a duplicate.

We can also choose a word that doesn't have a duplicate at 4, like ""ROMEO"", to test if there is an O at the end.

But let's decide.

I think ""ROGER"" is a good choice because G is a common letter.

But let's check: in the available letters, G is allowed.

So I'll go with ""ROGER"".

But earlier I thought of ""ROVER"" too.

Another common word: ""ROWDY"" -> but D and Y? D is absent, so not.

""ROYAL"" -> A absent.

""ROBOT"" -> B and T? T is absent.

So not.

Therefore, I think ""ROGER"" is a good guess.

So the next guess is ""ROGER"".

   - E (✓): Correct position (index 3)  
   - D (x): Absent  

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed positions**:  
  - **R** at **index 0** (from ""roped"").  
  - **O** at **index 1** (from ""roped"").  
  - **E** at **index 3** (from ""tires"" and ""roped"").  
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, T, I, S, P, D (cannot be used).  
- **Unknown positions**:  
  - **Index 2**: One unknown letter (must be a new, untested letter).  
  - **Index 4**: One unknown letter (must be a new, untested letter).  
- **Word structure**: `R O ? E ?`  
- **Available letters**: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (prioritize common letters like G, L, M, U).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Goal**: Solve the word by filling index 2 and 4 with untested letters, while adhering to the structure `R O ? E ?`.  
- **Approach**:  
  - Test high-frequency letters (e.g., G, L, M) to maximize information.  
  - Consider common English words fitting the pattern.  
- **Top candidates**:  
  - **""ROGER""**: Uses G (common) and tests R at index 4 (possible duplicate R).  
  - **""ROVER""**: Uses V (less common) and tests R at index 4.  
  - **""ROMEO""**: Uses M and tests O at index 4 (possible duplicate O).  
- **Selection**: **""ROGER""** is chosen because:  
  - It tests **G** (high-frequency consonant) at index 2.  
  - It tests for a possible duplicate **R** at index 4 (consistent with feedback, as duplicates are allowed).  
  - It is a common word that fits all constraints.  

<guess>roger</guess>",roger,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: absent (x)
  R: present, wrong position (-) -> so R is in the word, but not at position 1 (index 1)
  A: absent (x)
  N: absent (x)
  E: present, wrong position (-) -> E is in the word, but not at position 4 (index 4)

Guess 2: ""tires""
  T: absent (x)
  I: absent (x)
  R: present, wrong position (-) -> R is in the word, but not at position 2 (index 2)
  E: correct position (✓) -> E is at position 3 (index 3)
  S: absent (x)

Guess 3: ""roped""
  R: correct position (✓) -> R is at position 0 (index 0)
  O: correct position (✓) -> O is at position 1 (index 1)
  P: absent (x)
  E: correct position (✓) -> E is at position 3 (index 3) (already known)
  D: absent (x)

So now we know:
- The word has R at index 0, O at index 1, and E at index 3.
- The letters C, A, N, T, I, S, P, D are absent.
- We have to fill the remaining positions: index 2 and index 4.

The word structure is: R O _ E _

We know the word has R, O, E, and two more letters that are not in the absent list.

Absent letters: C, A, N, T, I, S, P, D.

So available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly others, but these are the common ones).

We need to find a 5-letter word that fits: R O ? E ? 

And the two missing letters must be from the available set.

We also know that the word does not contain any of the absent letters.

Let's think of common words that start with ""RO"" and have ""E"" at the fourth position.

Possible words:
- R O L E X -> but X is the last letter. However, we have to check if L is allowed. L is not in the absent list, so it's allowed. But we have to check the feedback for the third guess: we have P and D absent, but L hasn't been tested.

But note: in ""roped"", we only know about R, O, P, E, D. We don't know about L.

So ""ROLEX"" is a brand, but it might be accepted? However, let's see if there are more common words.

- R O B E ? -> but B was not tested, but we have ""ROBES"" which has S (absent) and we need 5 letters. ""ROBED"" has D (absent). So not possible.

- R O M E O -> 5 letters? R O M E O -> positions: 0:R, 1:O, 2:M, 3:E, 4:O -> but O is repeated? We don't know if the word allows duplicates. But in our feedback, we haven't seen any duplicate yet. However, it's possible.

But let's check the feedback: in ""roped"", we have O at index1 and it was correct, but if the word has O at index4, that would be a duplicate. We don't have information about duplicates, so it's possible.

But ""ROMEO"" has two O's. And M is not in the absent list.

So ""ROMEO"" is a possibility.

- R O G U E -> R(0), O(1), G(2), U(3) -> but we need E at index3, not U. So invalid.

- R O L E S -> but S is absent.

- R O V E R -> R(0), O(1), V(2), E(3), R(4) -> duplicate R? But we know R is at index0, so if there's another R at index4, that's possible. And V is allowed.

""ROVER"" is a valid word.

- R O W E R -> W is allowed, but ""ROWER"" has two R's and two E's? R O W E R: positions: 0:R, 1:O, 2:W, 3:E, 4:R -> duplicate R.

- R O B E R T -> too long.

- R O L E D -> D is absent.

- R O M E S -> S absent.

- R O G E R -> R(0), O(1), G(2), E(3), R(4) -> duplicate R. ""ROGER"" is a word.

- R O L E K -> not a word.

So the common words I can think of are: ""ROMEO"", ""ROVER"", ""ROGER"".

Now, we have to check which of these fit the feedback.

First, we know from guess 1: E was present but not at index4. In ""ROMEO"", E is at index3 (which we know is correct) and the last letter is O. In ""ROVER"", last letter is R. In ""ROGER"", last letter is R.

Also, in guess 1, R was at index1 and was wrong. In ""ROMEO"", R is at index0 and index4? No, in ""ROMEO"", R is only at index0. The word is R-O-M-E-O, so the last letter is O, not R. So R is only at index0.

In ""ROVER"": R at index0 and index4.

In ""ROGER"": R at index0 and index4.

Now, from guess 1: we had R at index1 (in ""crane"") and it was present but wrong position. That means the word has at least one R, but not at index1. In ""ROMEO"", there is only one R (at index0), so that matches. In ""ROVER"" and ""ROGER"", there are two R's: one at index0 and one at index4. But the R at index0 is correct, and the R at index4 is additional. The feedback from guess1 only said R is present and not at index1, but it didn't say how many. So duplicates are allowed.

But in guess3, we have R at index0 correct, so if the word has another R, that's fine.

Now, we need to see if we can distinguish.

But we have to make a guess. We have two positions to fill: index2 and index4.

We know the word is R O ? E ?

The possibilities we have: 
- ""ROMEO"": ? at index2 is M, and index4 is O. But O is already used at index1. Is that allowed? Yes, but we don't know if O is duplicated.
- ""ROVER"": ? at index2 is V, index4 is R.
- ""ROGER"": ? at index2 is G, index4 is R.

We also have other words? Like ""ROUEN"" (but N is absent), ""ROTED"" (T and D absent), etc.

Another word: ""ROHEE"" ? Not common.

""ROKEE""? Not common.

""ROLEO""? Not a word.

So the main candidates are ""ROMEO"", ""ROVER"", ""ROGER"".

We need to choose one that tests new letters.

But note: we have to avoid P and D (from guess3), and the other absent letters.

In ""ROMEO"", we use M and O (O is already known, but we are using it again at the end). We haven't tested M.

In ""ROVER"", we use V and R (R is known, but we are using it again at the end). We haven't tested V.

In ""ROGER"", we use G and R (again, R at the end). We haven't tested G.

We can choose any of these, but we want to maximize the chance of being correct or getting information.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses a letter that is more common.

But V, G, M are all reasonable.

We can also consider that if we guess ""ROVER"" and it's wrong, we still have ""ROGER"" and ""ROMEO"" as possibilities.

But we have only 3 guesses left (after this one, 2 left? We've used 3, so 3 left? Wordle has 6 guesses total, so we have 3 more).

But we can try to guess one of them.

Another idea: we can use a word that doesn't assume the last letter is R or O, but uses a new letter at index4.

For example, ""ROLE"" is 4 letters, so we need 5. ""ROLES"" has S absent.

""ROTED"" has T and D absent.

""ROBED"" has D absent.

""ROPED"" we already tried.

""ROWED"" has D absent.

""ROUEN"" has N absent.

""ROACH"" has C and H? C is absent, H is allowed. But C is absent, so not.

So it's hard to find a word that doesn't end with R or O and uses allowed letters.

Therefore, we should guess one of the candidates.

I think ""ROVER"" is a good choice because V is a common letter? Or is it? Actually, V is less common than M or G? Let me check the frequency.

In English, G is more common than V and M? Actually, according to letter frequency:

E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, ... then C, M, F, W, Y, P, G, B, V, K, ...

So M is more common than G and V.

But we are not sure.

We can also consider that in ""ROMEO"", we are using O again. If the word has two O's, that might be less common? But possible.

But to get more information, we might want to test a new letter at index4.

But in all candidates, index4 is either O or R. We already know R and O are in the word, so if we put R or O at index4, we might not test a new letter.

But we have to fill the position.

Alternatively, we can try to guess ""ROMEO"" to test M and the duplicate O.

But let's see the feedback we would get.

If we guess ""ROVER"":
  R(0): ✓ (known)
  O(1): ✓ (known)
  V(2): ? 
  E(3): ✓ (known)
  R(4): ? 

If V is in the word and at index2, then ✓. If not, then x or -.

Similarly for ""ROGER"": G at index2.

But we don't have any information about V or G.

We can choose the most common word.

I think ""ROVER"" is a common word, and ""ROGER"" is also common. ""ROMEO"" is a name.

But all are valid.

Another word: ""ROTED"" is not allowed.

I think we should choose ""ROVER"" because it has V, which is less common, but if it's correct, we get it.

But to be safe, we can choose ""ROGER"" because G is more common? Actually, G is less common than M.

But let's look for the most frequent letters for position 2 and 4.

We don't have much data.

We can also consider that from the first guess, we had no information about duplicates, so duplicates are possible.

I think I'll go with ""ROVER"" because it's a common word.

But let's see the feedback from guess1: in ""crane"", we had R and E, and in ""tires"", we had R and E, and in ""roped"", we had R, O, E. So if the word has two R's, then in ""crane"", the R at index1 was not correct, but there might be another R. Similarly in ""tires"", R at index2 was not correct, but there might be another R at index0 or index4.

In ""ROVER"", we have two R's: one at 0 (which we know is correct) and one at 4. So the R at index4 is new.

Similarly, in ""ROGER"", two R's.

In ""ROMEO"", only one R and two O's.

Now, we have to choose.

But we have a correct R at 0, so if we put R at 4, we are testing if there is a duplicate.

We can also choose a word that doesn't have a duplicate at 4, like ""ROMEO"", to test if there is an O at the end.

But let's decide.

I think ""ROGER"" is a good choice because G is a common letter.

But let's check: in the available letters, G is allowed.

So I'll go with ""ROGER"".

But earlier I thought of ""ROVER"" too.

Another common word: ""ROWDY"" -> but D and Y? D is absent, so not.

""ROYAL"" -> A absent.

""ROBOT"" -> B and T? T is absent.

So not.

Therefore, I think ""ROGER"" is a good guess.

So the next guess is ""ROGER"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
