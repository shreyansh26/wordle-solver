We are starting the game. For the first guess, we want a word that can test as many common letters as possible. 
 This strategy helps in gathering maximum information about the secret word.
 Common vowels and consonants in English are: A, E, I, O, U, and common consonants include R, S, T, L, N, etc.

 One popular starting word is ""CRATE"" because it contains common letters: C, R, A, T, E.
 However, note that the word must be 5 letters and valid.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is another good starter, containing S, L, A, T, E.

 But let's consider: we want to cover as many frequent letters as possible. The word ""ROATE"" is also known to be good, but let me think.

 Another common one is ""RAISE"" which has R, A, I, S, E. It covers four vowels and a common consonant.

 However, note that the feedback symbols will tell us not only presence but also position. 

 Since we are at the first guess, any word that uses common letters is acceptable. I will choose ""RAISE"".

 Let me check: ""RAISE"" is a valid English word.

 So my first guess is ""RAISE"".
</think>
For the first guess, I need a word that uses common letters to maximize information. A strong starting word should include frequent vowels (A, E, I) and common consonants (R, S) to test multiple possibilities. ""RAISE"" fits this well—it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), covering five distinct letters to quickly identify matches.

We are given feedback on the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- I: ✓ (correct position)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
1. The letter 'I' is in the word and it is in the 3rd position (since in ""RAISE"", I is the third letter).
2. The letter 'A' is in the word, but not in the second position (where we placed it). It must be in one of the other positions: 1, 4, or 5? But note: the word is 5 letters, so positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. We know position 3 is 'I', so A cannot be there. Also, A is not in position 2, so it must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
3. The letters R, S, and E are not in the word at all. So we can avoid using these letters in future guesses.

Therefore, the secret word:
- Must have 'I' in the 3rd position.
- Must contain the letter 'A', but not in the 2nd position (so in 1st, 4th, or 5th).
- Does not contain R, S, E.

We also know that the word is 5 letters and a valid English word.

For the next guess, we want to test possible positions for 'A' and also try to include other common letters that haven't been ruled out.

Common letters that are still available: we can use letters like T, N, O, L, C, D, U, M, P, etc. (avoiding R, S, E).

We also want to consider that 'A' must be in the word, so we can try to place it in a different position.

Possible positions for 'A':
- Position 1: first letter
- Position 4: fourth letter
- Position 5: fifth letter

We can design a guess that tests one of these positions and also includes new common letters.

Let's think of words that:
- Have 'I' in the third position.
- Include an 'A' in either position 1, 4, or 5 (but not 2, and we know it's not 3 because that's I).
- Avoid R, S, E.

Also, we want to use as many new common letters as possible to get more information.

Let me list some words that fit:

Option 1: Place 'A' in position 1.
Words: A?I?? 
Example: ""ACTIN"" - but we don't know if that's valid? Actually, we need common words.

But note: we don't have to get the whole word right, just test.

Another idea: We can try to test multiple possibilities at once.

Let me think of words that have 'I' in the third position and include 'A' in position 4 or 5, and also include other common letters.

For example, if we put 'A' in position 4: 
Pattern: ? ? I A ?

Words: ""BLACK"" but that has 'C' and 'K', and also 'B' and 'L'. But note: we don't have any information about these yet.

But we must avoid R, S, E.

Another word: ""CHINA"" - but that has 'H' and 'N', and 'A' in the fourth position? 
C H I N A -> positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:I, 4:N, 5:A -> so 'A' is in position 5, not 4. But we can test position 5.

Alternatively, for position 4: ""MEDIA"" but that has E which is ruled out -> not allowed because E is not in the word.

We must avoid E, so ""MEDIA"" is invalid because it contains E.

Another word: ""MANIA"" - but that has M, A, N, I, A. 
M A N I A -> positions: 1:M, 2:A, 3:N? -> no, we need I in the third. So ""MANIA"" is M A N I A -> third letter is N, not I.

We need the third letter to be I.

So: ? ? I ? ?

And we want to include A in position 1, 4, or 5.

Also, avoid R, S, E.

Let me try to find words with pattern: 
- If A in position 1: A ? I ? ?
  Examples: ""ACTIN"" (A C T I N) - valid? ACTIN is a word (a type of protein). But let's see if we can find more common words.
  ""ADMIN"" (A D M I N) - but that has D, M, N. And I in third? A D M I N -> positions: 1:A, 2:D, 3:M -> no, third is M, not I.

We need the third letter to be I. So the pattern is: [letter1] [letter2] I [letter4] [letter5]

So for A in position 1: A [letter2] I [letter4] [letter5]

Words: 
- ""AEGIS"" -> but has E and S, which are ruled out -> invalid.
- ""ALBIN"" -> not common, and has L, B, N.
- ""AXIOM"" -> has X, O, M. But also has O? A X I O M -> that's A in 1, X in 2, I in 3, O in 4, M in 5. And no R,S,E. So ""AXIOM"" is a valid word.

But is ""AXIOM"" common? Yes.

Now, if we put A in position 4: pattern: [letter1] [letter2] I A [letter5]
Words: 
- ""OPTIC"" -> O P T I C -> third is T, not I -> no.
- We need third to be I, so: [letter1] [letter2] I A [letter5]
  Example: ""CAMIA"" -> not common? 
  ""DELIA"" -> has E -> invalid.
  ""HELIA"" -> has E and H -> invalid because of E? Actually, E is not allowed at all because it's not in the secret word. So any word with E is invalid.

We must avoid E, so words with E are not allowed.

Another: ""TACIT"" -> T A C I T -> third is C, not I -> no.

Pattern for A in position 4: [letter1] [letter2] I A [letter5]
Example: ""UTICA"" -> U T I C A -> that's U in 1, T in 2, I in 3, C in 4, A in 5? Wait, position 4 is C, and A is in position 5. So that's not A in position 4.

We want A in position 4: so the fourth letter must be A.

So: [letter1] [letter2] I A [letter5]
Example: ""CIVIC"" -> C I V I C -> third is V? No, positions: 1:C, 2:I, 3:V, 4:I, 5:C -> not I in third? Wait, we need third to be I, so that's fixed.

So: [letter1] [letter2] I A [letter5]
- ""FOLIA"" -> F O L I A -> third is L, not I -> no.
- ""MAGIC"" -> M A G I C -> third is G, not I -> no.

It's hard to find words with I in third and A in fourth.

Similarly, for A in position 5: pattern: [letter1] [letter2] I [letter4] A
Examples: 
- ""ALPHA"" -> A L P H A -> third is P, not I -> no.
- ""BONZA"" -> B O N Z A -> third is N -> no.
- ""CHINA"" -> C H I N A -> third is I, and fifth is A. So that works. And no R,S,E.

So ""CHINA"" is a candidate.

Another: ""TIBIA"" -> T I B I A -> third is B? No: positions: 1:T, 2:I, 3:B, 4:I, 5:A -> third is B, not I.

We need the third letter to be I, so: [letter1] [letter2] I [letter4] A
- ""CHINA"": C H I N A -> 1:C, 2:H, 3:I, 4:N, 5:A -> perfect.
- ""THYMI"" -> not a word? Thymi is plural of thymus, but usually not 5 letters? And it ends with I, not A.

Another: ""CAMPA"" -> not a word? 
""JIAOS"" -> has S -> invalid.

So ""CHINA"" is a good candidate.

But note: we also want to test other common letters. In ""CHINA"", we are testing C, H, N, and we already know I and A.

But we are not testing the position of A very well because we are putting it at the end. However, we know A is not in position 2, and we are testing position 5.

Alternatively, we could test A in position 1. We had ""AXIOM"" as a candidate.

Let me compare:
- ""AXIOM"": tests A in position 1, and also X, O, M. 
- ""CHINA"": tests A in position 5, and C, H, N.

Both are valid and avoid R, S, E.

We also have the option to test A in position 4, but we couldn't find a common word. So let's not force that.

Another candidate: ""ABOIL"" -> not common.

Or ""ADMIT"" -> A D M I T -> third is M, not I -> no.

So between ""AXIOM"" and ""CHINA"", which one uses more common letters? 
Common letters: T, N, O, L, C, D, U, M, P, H, etc.

""CHINA"" has C, H, N -> N is very common.
""AXIOM"" has X (rare), O, M.

So ""CHINA"" might be better because N is more common than X.

But we also want to test the position of A. Since we know A is in the word but not in position 2, and we have position 1,4,5 as possibilities. 

In ""CHINA"", we are testing A in position 5. If we get feedback that A is not in position 5, then we know it must be in 1 or 4.

Similarly, in ""AXIOM"", we test A in position 1.

But note: we are also testing other letters. We might get more information from ""CHINA"" because N is common.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't put A in a fixed position but uses it in a position we haven't tested? But we have to put it somewhere.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has A in a position we haven't tested (so not position 2) and also includes other common letters.

But we have to have I in the third.

Let me think of other words with I in third and A somewhere else.

For example: ""DAILY"" -> D A I L Y -> third is I? Positions: 1:D, 2:A, 3:I -> but A is in position 2, which we know is not allowed because the feedback said A is not in position 2. So we cannot put A in position 2 again.

So we must avoid position 2 for A.

Therefore, in ""DAILY"", we are putting A in position 2, which is invalid because we know A is not in position 2. So that guess would be wasting a letter.

So we must not put A in position 2.

Therefore, for the next guess, we must have:
- Third letter: I
- A in position 1, 4, or 5.
- No R, S, E.

And we want to test as many new common letters as possible.

Another candidate: ""PAINT"" -> P A I N T -> third is I? Positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:I -> but A is in position 2, which is not allowed. So invalid.

Similarly, ""MAINS"" -> has S -> invalid.

""TALIK"" -> not common.

""VALID"" -> has L, I, D. But V A L I D -> third is L, not I -> no.

""OCTIC"" -> not common.

""LIPID"" -> L I P I D -> third is P, not I -> no.

So let's go with ""CHINA"" or ""AXIOM"". 

I think ""CHINA"" is a better choice because it has more common letters (C, H, N) and avoids very rare letters like X.

So I'll go with ""CHINA"".

But note: we are also testing the presence of C, H, N. If any of these are in the word, we'll get feedback.

Also, if A is in position 5, we'll get a check for A; if not, we'll get a minus or an x.

Similarly, we know I is already correct, so that will be a check.

So let's guess ""CHINA"".

But wait, what if the word has duplicate letters? We don't know, but the feedback will tell us.

So the next guess: ""CHINA""

We'll get feedback on each letter.

But note: we are using the letter A again, which we know is in the word, but we are testing its position.

This is acceptable.

So I choose ""CHINA"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, S, and E are not in the secret word (x).
- A is in the word but not in the second position (-).
- I is in the word and correctly placed in the third position (✓).

Key deductions:
- The secret word must have 'I' in the third position.
- It contains 'A' but not in position 1, 2, or 5 (since it was misplaced in position 2, and positions 1 and 5 were not tested yet; it could be in position 4).
- R, S, and E are eliminated, so the new guess must avoid these letters.
- The goal is to test 'A' in a new position (position 1, 4, or 5) while introducing common unused letters (e.g., C, H, N, T, O) to gather more information.

After evaluating options:
- ""CHINA"" fits the criteria: 
  - 'I' is in the third position.
  - 'A' is tested in position 5 (a new position to check).
  - Avoids R, S, E.
  - Introduces common letters C, H, and N for additional feedback.

This guess will help narrow down the position of 'A' and reveal if any of C, H, or N are in the word.

<guess>CHINA</guess>",CHINA,"We are given feedback on the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- I: ✓ (correct position)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
1. The letter 'I' is in the word and it is in the 3rd position (since in ""RAISE"", I is the third letter).
2. The letter 'A' is in the word, but not in the second position (where we placed it). It must be in one of the other positions: 1, 4, or 5? But note: the word is 5 letters, so positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. We know position 3 is 'I', so A cannot be there. Also, A is not in position 2, so it must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
3. The letters R, S, and E are not in the word at all. So we can avoid using these letters in future guesses.

Therefore, the secret word:
- Must have 'I' in the 3rd position.
- Must contain the letter 'A', but not in the 2nd position (so in 1st, 4th, or 5th).
- Does not contain R, S, E.

We also know that the word is 5 letters and a valid English word.

For the next guess, we want to test possible positions for 'A' and also try to include other common letters that haven't been ruled out.

Common letters that are still available: we can use letters like T, N, O, L, C, D, U, M, P, etc. (avoiding R, S, E).

We also want to consider that 'A' must be in the word, so we can try to place it in a different position.

Possible positions for 'A':
- Position 1: first letter
- Position 4: fourth letter
- Position 5: fifth letter

We can design a guess that tests one of these positions and also includes new common letters.

Let's think of words that:
- Have 'I' in the third position.
- Include an 'A' in either position 1, 4, or 5 (but not 2, and we know it's not 3 because that's I).
- Avoid R, S, E.

Also, we want to use as many new common letters as possible to get more information.

Let me list some words that fit:

Option 1: Place 'A' in position 1.
Words: A?I?? 
Example: ""ACTIN"" - but we don't know if that's valid? Actually, we need common words.

But note: we don't have to get the whole word right, just test.

Another idea: We can try to test multiple possibilities at once.

Let me think of words that have 'I' in the third position and include 'A' in position 4 or 5, and also include other common letters.

For example, if we put 'A' in position 4: 
Pattern: ? ? I A ?

Words: ""BLACK"" but that has 'C' and 'K', and also 'B' and 'L'. But note: we don't have any information about these yet.

But we must avoid R, S, E.

Another word: ""CHINA"" - but that has 'H' and 'N', and 'A' in the fourth position? 
C H I N A -> positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:I, 4:N, 5:A -> so 'A' is in position 5, not 4. But we can test position 5.

Alternatively, for position 4: ""MEDIA"" but that has E which is ruled out -> not allowed because E is not in the word.

We must avoid E, so ""MEDIA"" is invalid because it contains E.

Another word: ""MANIA"" - but that has M, A, N, I, A. 
M A N I A -> positions: 1:M, 2:A, 3:N? -> no, we need I in the third. So ""MANIA"" is M A N I A -> third letter is N, not I.

We need the third letter to be I.

So: ? ? I ? ?

And we want to include A in position 1, 4, or 5.

Also, avoid R, S, E.

Let me try to find words with pattern: 
- If A in position 1: A ? I ? ?
  Examples: ""ACTIN"" (A C T I N) - valid? ACTIN is a word (a type of protein). But let's see if we can find more common words.
  ""ADMIN"" (A D M I N) - but that has D, M, N. And I in third? A D M I N -> positions: 1:A, 2:D, 3:M -> no, third is M, not I.

We need the third letter to be I. So the pattern is: [letter1] [letter2] I [letter4] [letter5]

So for A in position 1: A [letter2] I [letter4] [letter5]

Words: 
- ""AEGIS"" -> but has E and S, which are ruled out -> invalid.
- ""ALBIN"" -> not common, and has L, B, N.
- ""AXIOM"" -> has X, O, M. But also has O? A X I O M -> that's A in 1, X in 2, I in 3, O in 4, M in 5. And no R,S,E. So ""AXIOM"" is a valid word.

But is ""AXIOM"" common? Yes.

Now, if we put A in position 4: pattern: [letter1] [letter2] I A [letter5]
Words: 
- ""OPTIC"" -> O P T I C -> third is T, not I -> no.
- We need third to be I, so: [letter1] [letter2] I A [letter5]
  Example: ""CAMIA"" -> not common? 
  ""DELIA"" -> has E -> invalid.
  ""HELIA"" -> has E and H -> invalid because of E? Actually, E is not allowed at all because it's not in the secret word. So any word with E is invalid.

We must avoid E, so words with E are not allowed.

Another: ""TACIT"" -> T A C I T -> third is C, not I -> no.

Pattern for A in position 4: [letter1] [letter2] I A [letter5]
Example: ""UTICA"" -> U T I C A -> that's U in 1, T in 2, I in 3, C in 4, A in 5? Wait, position 4 is C, and A is in position 5. So that's not A in position 4.

We want A in position 4: so the fourth letter must be A.

So: [letter1] [letter2] I A [letter5]
Example: ""CIVIC"" -> C I V I C -> third is V? No, positions: 1:C, 2:I, 3:V, 4:I, 5:C -> not I in third? Wait, we need third to be I, so that's fixed.

So: [letter1] [letter2] I A [letter5]
- ""FOLIA"" -> F O L I A -> third is L, not I -> no.
- ""MAGIC"" -> M A G I C -> third is G, not I -> no.

It's hard to find words with I in third and A in fourth.

Similarly, for A in position 5: pattern: [letter1] [letter2] I [letter4] A
Examples: 
- ""ALPHA"" -> A L P H A -> third is P, not I -> no.
- ""BONZA"" -> B O N Z A -> third is N -> no.
- ""CHINA"" -> C H I N A -> third is I, and fifth is A. So that works. And no R,S,E.

So ""CHINA"" is a candidate.

Another: ""TIBIA"" -> T I B I A -> third is B? No: positions: 1:T, 2:I, 3:B, 4:I, 5:A -> third is B, not I.

We need the third letter to be I, so: [letter1] [letter2] I [letter4] A
- ""CHINA"": C H I N A -> 1:C, 2:H, 3:I, 4:N, 5:A -> perfect.
- ""THYMI"" -> not a word? Thymi is plural of thymus, but usually not 5 letters? And it ends with I, not A.

Another: ""CAMPA"" -> not a word? 
""JIAOS"" -> has S -> invalid.

So ""CHINA"" is a good candidate.

But note: we also want to test other common letters. In ""CHINA"", we are testing C, H, N, and we already know I and A.

But we are not testing the position of A very well because we are putting it at the end. However, we know A is not in position 2, and we are testing position 5.

Alternatively, we could test A in position 1. We had ""AXIOM"" as a candidate.

Let me compare:
- ""AXIOM"": tests A in position 1, and also X, O, M. 
- ""CHINA"": tests A in position 5, and C, H, N.

Both are valid and avoid R, S, E.

We also have the option to test A in position 4, but we couldn't find a common word. So let's not force that.

Another candidate: ""ABOIL"" -> not common.

Or ""ADMIT"" -> A D M I T -> third is M, not I -> no.

So between ""AXIOM"" and ""CHINA"", which one uses more common letters? 
Common letters: T, N, O, L, C, D, U, M, P, H, etc.

""CHINA"" has C, H, N -> N is very common.
""AXIOM"" has X (rare), O, M.

So ""CHINA"" might be better because N is more common than X.

But we also want to test the position of A. Since we know A is in the word but not in position 2, and we have position 1,4,5 as possibilities. 

In ""CHINA"", we are testing A in position 5. If we get feedback that A is not in position 5, then we know it must be in 1 or 4.

Similarly, in ""AXIOM"", we test A in position 1.

But note: we are also testing other letters. We might get more information from ""CHINA"" because N is common.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't put A in a fixed position but uses it in a position we haven't tested? But we have to put it somewhere.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has A in a position we haven't tested (so not position 2) and also includes other common letters.

But we have to have I in the third.

Let me think of other words with I in third and A somewhere else.

For example: ""DAILY"" -> D A I L Y -> third is I? Positions: 1:D, 2:A, 3:I -> but A is in position 2, which we know is not allowed because the feedback said A is not in position 2. So we cannot put A in position 2 again.

So we must avoid position 2 for A.

Therefore, in ""DAILY"", we are putting A in position 2, which is invalid because we know A is not in position 2. So that guess would be wasting a letter.

So we must not put A in position 2.

Therefore, for the next guess, we must have:
- Third letter: I
- A in position 1, 4, or 5.
- No R, S, E.

And we want to test as many new common letters as possible.

Another candidate: ""PAINT"" -> P A I N T -> third is I? Positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:I -> but A is in position 2, which is not allowed. So invalid.

Similarly, ""MAINS"" -> has S -> invalid.

""TALIK"" -> not common.

""VALID"" -> has L, I, D. But V A L I D -> third is L, not I -> no.

""OCTIC"" -> not common.

""LIPID"" -> L I P I D -> third is P, not I -> no.

So let's go with ""CHINA"" or ""AXIOM"". 

I think ""CHINA"" is a better choice because it has more common letters (C, H, N) and avoids very rare letters like X.

So I'll go with ""CHINA"".

But note: we are also testing the presence of C, H, N. If any of these are in the word, we'll get feedback.

Also, if A is in position 5, we'll get a check for A; if not, we'll get a minus or an x.

Similarly, we know I is already correct, so that will be a check.

So let's guess ""CHINA"".

But wait, what if the word has duplicate letters? We don't know, but the feedback will tell us.

So the next guess: ""CHINA""

We'll get feedback on each letter.

But note: we are using the letter A again, which we know is in the word, but we are testing its position.

This is acceptable.

So I choose ""CHINA"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, S, and E are not in the secret word (x).
- A is in the word but not in the second position (-).
- I is in the word and correctly placed in the third position (✓).

Key deductions:
- The secret word must have 'I' in the third position.
- It contains 'A' but not in position 1, 2, or 5 (since it was misplaced in position 2, and positions 1 and 5 were not tested yet; it could be in position 4).
- R, S, and E are eliminated, so the new guess must avoid these letters.
- The goal is to test 'A' in a new position (position 1, 4, or 5) while introducing common unused letters (e.g., C, H, N, T, O) to gather more information.

After evaluating options:
- ""CHINA"" fits the criteria: 
  - 'I' is in the third position.
  - 'A' is tested in position 5 (a new position to check).
  - Avoids R, S, E.
  - Introduces common letters C, H, and N for additional feedback.

This guess will help narrow down the position of 'A' and reveal if any of C, H, or N are in the word.",Guess 2: CHINA -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) I(✓) N(-) A(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,AVIAN,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. For the first guess, we want a word that can test as many common letters as possible. 
 This strategy helps in gathering maximum information about the secret word.
 Common vowels and consonants in English are: A, E, I, O, U, and common consonants include R, S, T, L, N, etc.

 One popular starting word is ""CRATE"" because it contains common letters: C, R, A, T, E.
 However, note that the word must be 5 letters and valid.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is another good starter, containing S, L, A, T, E.

 But let's consider: we want to cover as many frequent letters as possible. The word ""ROATE"" is also known to be good, but let me think.

 Another common one is ""RAISE"" which has R, A, I, S, E. It covers four vowels and a common consonant.

 However, note that the feedback symbols will tell us not only presence but also position. 

 Since we are at the first guess, any word that uses common letters is acceptable. I will choose ""RAISE"".

 Let me check: ""RAISE"" is a valid English word.

 So my first guess is ""RAISE"".For the first guess, I need a word that uses common letters to maximize information. A strong starting word should include frequent vowels (A, E, I) and common consonants (R, S) to test multiple possibilities. ""RAISE"" fits this well—it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), covering five distinct letters to quickly identify matches.

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(✓) S(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- I: ✓ (correct position)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
1. The letter 'I' is in the word and it is in the 3rd position (since in ""RAISE"", I is the third letter).
2. The letter 'A' is in the word, but not in the second position (where we placed it). It must be in one of the other positions: 1, 4, or 5? But note: the word is 5 letters, so positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. We know position 3 is 'I', so A cannot be there. Also, A is not in position 2, so it must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
3. The letters R, S, and E are not in the word at all. So we can avoid using these letters in future guesses.

Therefore, the secret word:
- Must have 'I' in the 3rd position.
- Must contain the letter 'A', but not in the 2nd position (so in 1st, 4th, or 5th).
- Does not contain R, S, E.

We also know that the word is 5 letters and a valid English word.

For the next guess, we want to test possible positions for 'A' and also try to include other common letters that haven't been ruled out.

Common letters that are still available: we can use letters like T, N, O, L, C, D, U, M, P, etc. (avoiding R, S, E).

We also want to consider that 'A' must be in the word, so we can try to place it in a different position.

Possible positions for 'A':
- Position 1: first letter
- Position 4: fourth letter
- Position 5: fifth letter

We can design a guess that tests one of these positions and also includes new common letters.

Let's think of words that:
- Have 'I' in the third position.
- Include an 'A' in either position 1, 4, or 5 (but not 2, and we know it's not 3 because that's I).
- Avoid R, S, E.

Also, we want to use as many new common letters as possible to get more information.

Let me list some words that fit:

Option 1: Place 'A' in position 1.
Words: A?I?? 
Example: ""ACTIN"" - but we don't know if that's valid? Actually, we need common words.

But note: we don't have to get the whole word right, just test.

Another idea: We can try to test multiple possibilities at once.

Let me think of words that have 'I' in the third position and include 'A' in position 4 or 5, and also include other common letters.

For example, if we put 'A' in position 4: 
Pattern: ? ? I A ?

Words: ""BLACK"" but that has 'C' and 'K', and also 'B' and 'L'. But note: we don't have any information about these yet.

But we must avoid R, S, E.

Another word: ""CHINA"" - but that has 'H' and 'N', and 'A' in the fourth position? 
C H I N A -> positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:I, 4:N, 5:A -> so 'A' is in position 5, not 4. But we can test position 5.

Alternatively, for position 4: ""MEDIA"" but that has E which is ruled out -> not allowed because E is not in the word.

We must avoid E, so ""MEDIA"" is invalid because it contains E.

Another word: ""MANIA"" - but that has M, A, N, I, A. 
M A N I A -> positions: 1:M, 2:A, 3:N? -> no, we need I in the third. So ""MANIA"" is M A N I A -> third letter is N, not I.

We need the third letter to be I.

So: ? ? I ? ?

And we want to include A in position 1, 4, or 5.

Also, avoid R, S, E.

Let me try to find words with pattern: 
- If A in position 1: A ? I ? ?
  Examples: ""ACTIN"" (A C T I N) - valid? ACTIN is a word (a type of protein). But let's see if we can find more common words.
  ""ADMIN"" (A D M I N) - but that has D, M, N. And I in third? A D M I N -> positions: 1:A, 2:D, 3:M -> no, third is M, not I.

We need the third letter to be I. So the pattern is: [letter1] [letter2] I [letter4] [letter5]

So for A in position 1: A [letter2] I [letter4] [letter5]

Words: 
- ""AEGIS"" -> but has E and S, which are ruled out -> invalid.
- ""ALBIN"" -> not common, and has L, B, N.
- ""AXIOM"" -> has X, O, M. But also has O? A X I O M -> that's A in 1, X in 2, I in 3, O in 4, M in 5. And no R,S,E. So ""AXIOM"" is a valid word.

But is ""AXIOM"" common? Yes.

Now, if we put A in position 4: pattern: [letter1] [letter2] I A [letter5]
Words: 
- ""OPTIC"" -> O P T I C -> third is T, not I -> no.
- We need third to be I, so: [letter1] [letter2] I A [letter5]
  Example: ""CAMIA"" -> not common? 
  ""DELIA"" -> has E -> invalid.
  ""HELIA"" -> has E and H -> invalid because of E? Actually, E is not allowed at all because it's not in the secret word. So any word with E is invalid.

We must avoid E, so words with E are not allowed.

Another: ""TACIT"" -> T A C I T -> third is C, not I -> no.

Pattern for A in position 4: [letter1] [letter2] I A [letter5]
Example: ""UTICA"" -> U T I C A -> that's U in 1, T in 2, I in 3, C in 4, A in 5? Wait, position 4 is C, and A is in position 5. So that's not A in position 4.

We want A in position 4: so the fourth letter must be A.

So: [letter1] [letter2] I A [letter5]
Example: ""CIVIC"" -> C I V I C -> third is V? No, positions: 1:C, 2:I, 3:V, 4:I, 5:C -> not I in third? Wait, we need third to be I, so that's fixed.

So: [letter1] [letter2] I A [letter5]
- ""FOLIA"" -> F O L I A -> third is L, not I -> no.
- ""MAGIC"" -> M A G I C -> third is G, not I -> no.

It's hard to find words with I in third and A in fourth.

Similarly, for A in position 5: pattern: [letter1] [letter2] I [letter4] A
Examples: 
- ""ALPHA"" -> A L P H A -> third is P, not I -> no.
- ""BONZA"" -> B O N Z A -> third is N -> no.
- ""CHINA"" -> C H I N A -> third is I, and fifth is A. So that works. And no R,S,E.

So ""CHINA"" is a candidate.

Another: ""TIBIA"" -> T I B I A -> third is B? No: positions: 1:T, 2:I, 3:B, 4:I, 5:A -> third is B, not I.

We need the third letter to be I, so: [letter1] [letter2] I [letter4] A
- ""CHINA"": C H I N A -> 1:C, 2:H, 3:I, 4:N, 5:A -> perfect.
- ""THYMI"" -> not a word? Thymi is plural of thymus, but usually not 5 letters? And it ends with I, not A.

Another: ""CAMPA"" -> not a word? 
""JIAOS"" -> has S -> invalid.

So ""CHINA"" is a good candidate.

But note: we also want to test other common letters. In ""CHINA"", we are testing C, H, N, and we already know I and A.

But we are not testing the position of A very well because we are putting it at the end. However, we know A is not in position 2, and we are testing position 5.

Alternatively, we could test A in position 1. We had ""AXIOM"" as a candidate.

Let me compare:
- ""AXIOM"": tests A in position 1, and also X, O, M. 
- ""CHINA"": tests A in position 5, and C, H, N.

Both are valid and avoid R, S, E.

We also have the option to test A in position 4, but we couldn't find a common word. So let's not force that.

Another candidate: ""ABOIL"" -> not common.

Or ""ADMIT"" -> A D M I T -> third is M, not I -> no.

So between ""AXIOM"" and ""CHINA"", which one uses more common letters? 
Common letters: T, N, O, L, C, D, U, M, P, H, etc.

""CHINA"" has C, H, N -> N is very common.
""AXIOM"" has X (rare), O, M.

So ""CHINA"" might be better because N is more common than X.

But we also want to test the position of A. Since we know A is in the word but not in position 2, and we have position 1,4,5 as possibilities. 

In ""CHINA"", we are testing A in position 5. If we get feedback that A is not in position 5, then we know it must be in 1 or 4.

Similarly, in ""AXIOM"", we test A in position 1.

But note: we are also testing other letters. We might get more information from ""CHINA"" because N is common.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't put A in a fixed position but uses it in a position we haven't tested? But we have to put it somewhere.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has A in a position we haven't tested (so not position 2) and also includes other common letters.

But we have to have I in the third.

Let me think of other words with I in third and A somewhere else.

For example: ""DAILY"" -> D A I L Y -> third is I? Positions: 1:D, 2:A, 3:I -> but A is in position 2, which we know is not allowed because the feedback said A is not in position 2. So we cannot put A in position 2 again.

So we must avoid position 2 for A.

Therefore, in ""DAILY"", we are putting A in position 2, which is invalid because we know A is not in position 2. So that guess would be wasting a letter.

So we must not put A in position 2.

Therefore, for the next guess, we must have:
- Third letter: I
- A in position 1, 4, or 5.
- No R, S, E.

And we want to test as many new common letters as possible.

Another candidate: ""PAINT"" -> P A I N T -> third is I? Positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:I -> but A is in position 2, which is not allowed. So invalid.

Similarly, ""MAINS"" -> has S -> invalid.

""TALIK"" -> not common.

""VALID"" -> has L, I, D. But V A L I D -> third is L, not I -> no.

""OCTIC"" -> not common.

""LIPID"" -> L I P I D -> third is P, not I -> no.

So let's go with ""CHINA"" or ""AXIOM"". 

I think ""CHINA"" is a better choice because it has more common letters (C, H, N) and avoids very rare letters like X.

So I'll go with ""CHINA"".

But note: we are also testing the presence of C, H, N. If any of these are in the word, we'll get feedback.

Also, if A is in position 5, we'll get a check for A; if not, we'll get a minus or an x.

Similarly, we know I is already correct, so that will be a check.

So let's guess ""CHINA"".

But wait, what if the word has duplicate letters? We don't know, but the feedback will tell us.

So the next guess: ""CHINA""

We'll get feedback on each letter.

But note: we are using the letter A again, which we know is in the word, but we are testing its position.

This is acceptable.

So I choose ""CHINA"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, S, and E are not in the secret word (x).
- A is in the word but not in the second position (-).
- I is in the word and correctly placed in the third position (✓).

Key deductions:
- The secret word must have 'I' in the third position.
- It contains 'A' but not in position 1, 2, or 5 (since it was misplaced in position 2, and positions 1 and 5 were not tested yet; it could be in position 4).
- R, S, and E are eliminated, so the new guess must avoid these letters.
- The goal is to test 'A' in a new position (position 1, 4, or 5) while introducing common unused letters (e.g., C, H, N, T, O) to gather more information.

After evaluating options:
- ""CHINA"" fits the criteria: 
  - 'I' is in the third position.
  - 'A' is tested in position 5 (a new position to check).
  - Avoids R, S, E.
  - Introduces common letters C, H, and N for additional feedback.

This guess will help narrow down the position of 'A' and reveal if any of C, H, or N are in the word.

So we can avoid using these letters in future guesses.\n\nTherefore, the secret word:\n- Must have \'I\' in the 3rd position.\n- Must contain the letter \'A\', but not in the 2nd position (so in 1st, 4th, or 5th).\n- Does not contain R, S, E.\n\nWe also know that the word is 5 letters and a valid English word.\n\nFor the next guess, we want to test possible positions for \'A\' and also try to include other common letters that haven\'t been ruled out.\n\nCommon letters that are still available: we can use letters like T, N, O, L, C, D, U, M, P, etc. (avoiding R, S, E).\n\nWe also want to consider that \'A\' must be in the word, so we can try to place it in a different position.\n\nPossible positions for \'A\':\n- Position 1: first letter\n- Position 4: fourth letter\n- Position 5: fifth letter\n\nWe can design a guess that tests one of these positions and also includes new common letters.\n\nLet\'s think of words that:\n- Have \'I\' in the third position.\n- Include an \'A\' in either position 1, 4, or 5 (but not 2, and we know it\'s not 3 because that\'s I).\n- Avoid R, S, E.\n\nAlso, we want to use as many new common letters as possible to get more information.\n\nLet me list some words that fit:\n\nOption 1: Place \'A\' in position 1.\nWords: A?I?? \nExample: ""ACTIN"" - but we don\'t know if that\'s valid? Actually, we need common words.\n\nBut note: we don\'t have to get the whole word right, just test.\n\nAnother idea: We can try to test multiple possibilities at once.\n\nLet me think of words that have \'I\' in the third position and include \'A\' in position 4 or 5, and also include other common letters.\n\nFor example, if we put \'A\' in position 4: \nPattern: ? ? I A ?\n\nWords: ""BLACK"" but that has \'C\' and \'K\', and also \'B\' and \'L\'. But note: we don\'t have any information about these yet.\n\nBut we must avoid R, S, E.\n\nAnother word: ""CHINA"" - but that has \'H\' and \'N\', and \'A\' in the fourth position? \nC H I N A -> positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:I, 4:N, 5:A -> so \'A\' is in position 5, not 4. But we can test position 5.\n\nAlternatively, for position 4: ""MEDIA"" but that has E which is ruled out -> not allowed because E is not in the word.\n\nWe must avoid E, so ""MEDIA"" is invalid because it contains E.\n\nAnother word: ""MANIA"" - but that has M, A, N, I, A. \nM A N I A -> positions: 1:M, 2:A, 3:N? -> no, we need I in the third. So ""MANIA"" is M A N I A -> third letter is N, not I.\n\nWe need the third letter to be I.\n\nSo: ? ? I ? ?\n\nAnd we want to include A in position 1, 4, or 5.\n\nAlso, avoid R, S, E.\n\nLet me try to find words with pattern: \n- If A in position 1: A ? I ? ?\n  Examples: ""ACTIN"" (A C T I N) - valid? ACTIN is a word (a type of protein). But let\'s see if we can find more common words.\n  ""ADMIN"" (A D M I N) - but that has D, M, N. And I in third? A D M I N -> positions: 1:A, 2:D, 3:M -> no, third is M, not I.\n\nWe need the third letter to be I. So the pattern is: [letter1] [letter2] I [letter4] [letter5]\n\nSo for A in position 1: A [letter2] I [letter4] [letter5]\n\nWords: \n- ""AEGIS"" -> but has E and S, which are ruled out -> invalid.\n- ""ALBIN"" -> not common, and has L, B, N.\n- ""AXIOM"" -> has X, O, M. But also has O? A X I O M -> that\'s A in 1, X in 2, I in 3, O in 4, M in 5. And no R,S,E. So ""AXIOM"" is a valid word.\n\nBut is ""AXIOM"" common? Yes.\n\nNow, if we put A in position 4: pattern: [letter1] [letter2] I A [letter5]\nWords: \n- ""OPTIC"" -> O P T I C -> third is T, not I -> no.\n- We need third to be I, so: [letter1] [letter2] I A [letter5]\n  Example: ""CAMIA"" -> not common? \n  ""DELIA"" -> has E -> invalid.\n  ""HELIA"" -> has E and H -> invalid because of E? Actually, E is not allowed at all because it\'s not in the secret word. So any word with E is invalid.\n\nWe must avoid E, so words with E are not allowed.\n\nAnother: ""TACIT"" -> T A C I T -> third is C, not I -> no.\n\nPattern for A in position 4: [letter1] [letter2] I A [letter5]\nExample: ""UTICA"" -> U T I C A -> that\'s U in 1, T in 2, I in 3, C in 4, A in 5? Wait, position 4 is C, and A is in position 5. So that\'s not A in position 4.\n\nWe want A in position 4: so the fourth letter must be A.\n\nSo: [letter1] [letter2] I A [letter5]\nExample: ""CIVIC"" -> C I V I C -> third is V? No, positions: 1:C, 2:I, 3:V, 4:I, 5:C -> not I in third? Wait, we need third to be I, so that\'s fixed.\n\nSo: [letter1] [letter2] I A [letter5]\n- ""FOLIA"" -> F O L I A -> third is L, not I -> no.\n- ""MAGIC"" -> M A G I C -> third is G, not I -> no.\n\nIt\'s hard to find words with I in third and A in fourth.\n\nSimilarly, for A in position 5: pattern: [letter1] [letter2] I [letter4] A\nExamples: \n- ""ALPHA"" -> A L P H A -> third is P, not I -> no.\n- ""BONZA"" -> B O N Z A -> third is N -> no.\n- ""CHINA"" -> C H I N A -> third is I, and fifth is A. So that works. And no R,S,E.\n\nSo ""CHINA"" is a candidate.\n\nAnother: ""TIBIA"" -> T I B I A -> third is B? No: positions: 1:T, 2:I, 3:B, 4:I, 5:A -> third is B, not I.\n\nWe need the third letter to be I, so: [letter1] [letter2] I [letter4] A\n- ""CHINA"": C H I N A -> 1:C, 2:H, 3:I, 4:N, 5:A -> perfect.\n- ""THYMI"" -> not a word? Thymi is plural of thymus, but usually not 5 letters? And it ends with I, not A.\n\nAnother: ""CAMPA"" -> not a word? \n""JIAOS"" -> has S -> invalid.\n\nSo ""CHINA"" is a good candidate.\n\nBut note: we also want to test other common letters. In ""CHINA"", we are testing C, H, N, and we already know I and A.\n\nBut we are not testing the position of A very well because we are putting it at the end. However, we know A is not in position 2, and we are testing position 5.\n\nAlternatively, we could test A in position 1. We had ""AXIOM"" as a candidate.\n\nLet me compare:\n- ""AXIOM"": tests A in position 1, and also X, O, M. \n- ""CHINA"": tests A in position 5, and C, H, N.\n\nBoth are valid and avoid R, S, E.\n\nWe also have the option to test A in position 4, but we couldn\'t find a common word. So let\'s not force that.\n\nAnother candidate: ""ABOIL"" -> not common.\n\nOr ""ADMIT"" -> A D M I T -> third is M, not I -> no.\n\nSo between ""AXIOM"" and ""CHINA"", which one uses more common letters? \nCommon letters: T, N, O, L, C, D, U, M, P, H, etc.\n\n""CHINA"" has C, H, N -> N is very common.\n""AXIOM"" has X (rare), O, M.\n\nSo ""CHINA"" might be better because N is more common than X.\n\nBut we also want to test the position of A. Since we know A is in the word but not in position 2, and we have position 1,4,5 as possibilities. \n\nIn ""CHINA"", we are testing A in position 5. If we get feedback that A is not in position 5, then we know it must be in 1 or 4.\n\nSimilarly, in ""AXIOM"", we test A in position 1.\n\nBut note: we are also testing other letters. We might get more information from ""CHINA"" because N is common.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t put A in a fixed position but uses it in a position we haven\'t tested? But we have to put it somewhere.\n\nAnother idea: we can choose a word that has A in a position we haven\'t tested (so not position 2) and also includes other common letters.\n\nBut we have to have I in the third.\n\nLet me think of other words with I in third and A somewhere else.\n\nFor example: ""DAILY"" -> D A I L Y -> third is I? Positions: 1:D, 2:A, 3:I -> but A is in position 2, which we know is not allowed because the feedback said A is not in position 2. So we cannot put A in position 2 again.\n\nSo we must avoid position 2 for A.\n\nTherefore, in ""DAILY"", we are putting A in position 2, which is invalid because we know A is not in position 2. So that guess would be wasting a letter.\n\nSo we must not put A in position 2.\n\nTherefore, for the next guess, we must have:\n- Third letter: I\n- A in position 1, 4, or 5.\n- No R, S, E.\n\nAnd we want to test as many new common letters as possible.\n\nAnother candidate: ""PAINT"" -> P A I N T -> third is I? Positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:I -> but A is in position 2, which is not allowed. So invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""MAINS"" -> has S -> invalid.\n\n""TALIK"" -> not common.\n\n""VALID"" -> has L, I, D. But V A L I D -> third is L, not I -> no.\n\n""OCTIC"" -> not common.\n\n""LIPID"" -> L I P I D -> third is P, not I -> no.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""CHINA"" or ""AXIOM"". \n\nI think ""CHINA"" is a better choice because it has more common letters (C, H, N) and avoids very rare letters like X.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""CHINA"".\n\nBut note: we are also testing the presence of C, H, N. If any of these are in the word, we\'ll get feedback.\n\nAlso, if A is in position 5, we\'ll get a check for A; if not, we\'ll get a minus or an x.\n\nSimilarly, we know I is already correct, so that will be a check.\n\nSo let\'s guess ""CHINA"".\n\nBut wait, what if the word has duplicate letters? We don\'t know, but the feedback will tell us.\n\nSo the next guess: ""CHINA""\n\nWe\'ll get feedback on each letter.\n\nBut note: we are using the letter A again, which we know is in the word, but we are testing its position.\n\nThis is acceptable.\n\nSo I choose ""CHINA"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R, S, and E are not in the secret word (x).\n- A is in the word but not in the second position (-).\n- I is in the word and correctly placed in the third position (✓).\n\nKey deductions:\n- The secret word must have \'I\' in the third position.\n- It contains \'A\' but not in position 1, 2, or 5 (since it was misplaced in position 2, and positions 1 and 5 were not tested yet; it could be in position 4).\n- R, S, and E are eliminated, so the new guess must avoid these letters.\n- The goal is to test \'A\' in a new position (position 1, 4, or 5) while introducing common unused letters (e.g., C, H, N, T, O) to gather more information.\n\nAfter evaluating options:\n- ""CHINA"" fits the criteria: \n  - \'I\' is in the third position.\n  - \'A\' is tested in position 5 (a new position to check).\n  - Avoids R, S, E.\n  - Introduces common letters C, H, and N for additional feedback.\n\nThis guess will help narrow down the position of \'A\' and reveal if any of C, H, or N are in the word.\n\n<guess>CHINA</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(✓) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: CHINA -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) I(✓) N(-) A(-)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- I: ✓ (correct position, so the third letter is I)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: CHINA
- C: x (not in the word)
- H: x (not in the word)
- I: ✓ (correct position, third letter is I, which we already knew)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)

From this, we know:
- The secret word has the letter I in the third position: _ _ I _ _
- The secret word contains A and N, but not in the positions we guessed.
  - For A: In RAISE, A was in position 2, but it was wrong position. In CHINA, A was in position 5, also wrong position. So A is not in position 2 or 5. Since the word is 5 letters, A must be in position 1 or 4.
  - For N: In CHINA, N was in position 4, but it was wrong position. So N is in the word but not in position 4. It could be in position 1, 2, or 5 (but note position 3 is I, so not there).
- Letters not in the word: R, S, E, C, H (from the x's).

Also, we know the word has A and N, and I, and two more letters we haven't found yet.

We need to form a new guess that:
- Has I in the third position.
- Includes A and N, but in positions we haven't tried for them (for A: not 2 or 5, so must be 1 or 4; for N: not 4, so must be 1, 2, or 5).
- Avoids the letters R, S, E, C, H.

We also want to test new common letters to get more information.

Possible positions:
- A must be in position 1 or 4.
- N must be in position 1, 2, or 5.

But note: if A is in position 1, then N cannot be in position 1 (since one letter per position). Similarly, if A is in position 4, then N cannot be in position 4 (which we already know).

We can consider two cases for A: position 1 or 4.

We also need to choose a word that is valid and uses common letters.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern and constraints.

First, if A is in position 1: A _ I _ _
We need to place N in one of 2, 4, or 5, but avoiding position 4 for N? No, we only know N is not in position 4 from the previous guess, but in this new word, if we put N in position 4, that would be the same as before? Actually, we know N is not in position 4 of the secret word, so in our guess, if we put N in position 4, it would be wrong, but we are trying to find where N is.

But we are allowed to put N in any position except we know it's not in 4 in the secret word, so in our guess, we can put it in 1,2,5 to test.

Similarly for A.

But to maximize information, we should try to put A in a position we haven't tested (so either 1 or 4) and N in a position we haven't tested (so 1,2,5) but avoiding the known bad positions for the secret.

Since we have two possibilities for A, we can choose one to test.

Also, we need two more letters for the remaining positions.

Let me list possible words:

Option 1: A in position 1.
Pattern: A _ I _ _
We need to fill positions 2,4,5 with letters that are not R,S,E,C,H, and include N in one of 2,4,5.

Possible words:
- A?I?N: e.g., ""ADMIN"" - but D and M are new, and N in position 5. Also, check if valid: ADMIN is a word. But we have to avoid R,S,E,C,H, which we are. However, in ADMIN, position 4 is I? No: A D M I N -> positions: 1:A, 2:D, 3:M, 4:I, 5:N -> but we need I in position 3, so that would be A D I ...? ADMIN has M in position 3, not I. So no.

We need the third letter to be I, so pattern: A _ I _ _

So for example:
- A N I _ _ -> but N in position 2? Then we have A N I ? ? 
  Words: ""ANVIL"" - A N V I L -> but third letter is V, not I -> no.
  ""ANIMI"" - not common, and third letter is M? A N I M I -> positions: 1:A, 2:N, 3:I, 4:M, 5:I -> that works. But ""ANIMI"" is plural of animus? Not very common, and we have two I's? The secret might have duplicate letters, but we don't know.

But let's avoid obscure words.

- A ? I N ? -> with N in position 4? But we know N is not in position 4 in the secret, so if we put N in position 4, it will be wrong, but we can do it to test? Actually, we want to use the guess to find the position, so we should put N in a position that might be correct, i.e., 1,2, or 5.

So for A in position 1 and N in position 2: A N I ? ? 
Words: ""ANION"" - A N I O N -> but that has two N's? And O. Positions: 1:A, 2:N, 3:I, 4:O, 5:N. This is a valid word (an ion is a type of atom). And it avoids R,S,E,C,H.

But we have N in position 2 and 5. We don't know if the secret has duplicate N.

Alternatively, ""ANIMA"" - A N I M A -> but M and A. But A is already in position 1, and we are putting A in position 5? But we know A is not in position 5 from previous feedback (in CHINA, A was in 5 and got - meaning not in 5). So we cannot put A in position 5 again? We can, but it would be a waste because we know it's not there. So better to avoid position 5 for A.

Similarly, for N, we don't know about position 5 yet.

But in ""ANION"", we have A in 1, N in 2 and 5, I in 3, O in 4.

But we know A is not in 5, so the A in position 5 would be incorrect, but in the secret, if there is no second A, it would be marked x. But we don't know if there is a duplicate A.

To keep it simple, let's avoid duplicate letters for now.

Another word: A ? I ? N with N in position 5: A _ I _ N
Words: ""AXIIN"" not a word.
""ALIEN"" but E is not allowed (we know E is not in the word).
""AVIAN"" - A V I A N -> positions: 1:A, 2:V, 3:I, 4:A, 5:N. This has A in 1 and 4. But we are testing A in position 1, and also position 4? But we know A is in the word, and if it's in position 1, then position 4 might be another A or not.

But ""AVIAN"" is a valid word. And it avoids R,S,E,C,H.

Now, if A is in position 4: pattern: _ _ I A _
We need to fill positions 1,2,5 with letters not R,S,E,C,H, and include N in one of 1,2,5.

For example:
- N in position 1: N _ I A _
  Words: ""NOMIA"" - N O M I A -> but third is M, not I -> no.
  ""NIVAL"" - N I V A L -> third is V, not I -> no.
  We need third to be I, so: N ? I A ? 
  Words: ""NAIAD"" - N A I A D -> but A is in position 2, which we know is not allowed (A not in position 2 from first guess). So invalid.
  ""NAIRA"" - N A I R A -> has R, which is not allowed (R is eliminated). Also, A in position 2 again.

- N in position 2: _ N I A _
  Words: ""UNICA"" - U N I C A -> but C is eliminated -> invalid.
  ""ONIUM"" - O N I U M -> but U and M. Valid? Onium is a chemistry term. Avoids bad letters. So ""ONIUM"" could work, but it has O, N, I, U, M.

- N in position 5: _ _ I A N
  Words: ""MAJOR"" but has R and J? Not allowed.
  ""LABIA"" - L A B I A -> but A in position 2 -> invalid.
  ""TOLAR"" has R -> invalid.
  ""KAPUT"" has K and P, U, T -> but no N? We need N in position 5. Pattern: _ _ I A N
  Words: ""URBAN"" - U R B A N -> has R -> invalid.
  ""PAGAN"" - P A G A N -> A in position 2 -> invalid.

It's hard to find words for A in position 4.

Another common word: ""DAILY"" but A in position 2 -> invalid.

So perhaps A in position 1 is easier.

Back to A in position 1: we have ""AVIAN"" as a candidate: A V I A N
But in ""AVIAN"", we have A in position 1 and 4. We know A is not in position 5, but position 4 is possible. Also, N in position 5.

But we are testing A in position 1 and 4? We don't know if there are two A's.

Another candidate: ""ADMIN"" doesn't work because of the third letter.

What about ""AXION"" - A X I O N -> positions: 1:A, 2:X, 3:I, 4:O, 5:N. This avoids bad letters. And it tests A in 1, N in 5.

Similarly, ""AVION"" - A V I O N -> same pattern.

""AVION"" is a word? It means aircraft, from French, but in English, it might be accepted.

But let's stick to common words.

""ANVIL"" has I in third? A N V I L -> third is V, not I.

""ALIGN"" - A L I G N -> positions: 1:A, 2:L, 3:I, 4:G, 5:N. This is a good word. Avoids bad letters. Tests A in 1, N in 5.

But we know from CHINA that N is not in position 4, but in this guess, N is in position 5, which is a new position. Also, A is in position 1.

So ""ALIGN"" is a valid guess.

Similarly, ""ALBIN"" is not common.

""APING"" - A P I N G -> but N in position 4? We know N is not in position 4 in the secret, so if we put N in position 4, it will be wrong. But in ""APING"", N is in position 4, which we know is incorrect for the secret. So it would be better to put N in a position that could be correct, like 2 or 5.

In ""ALIGN"", N is in position 5, which is untested.

Another word: ""AMINO"" - A M I N O -> positions: 1:A, 2:M, 3:I, 4:N, 5:O. But N is in position 4, which we know is not correct for the secret (from CHINA feedback: N in position 4 got - meaning not in that position). So if we put N in position 4 again, it will be wrong, and we don't gain new information about N's position. We should avoid that.

So ""AMINO"" is not good because it puts N in position 4 again.

Similarly, we should avoid putting A in position 5 because we know it's not there.

So back to ""ALIGN"": A in 1, N in 5, and new letters L and G.

We also have the option to test A in position 4.

But let's see if we can find a word with A in position 4.

For example: _ _ I A _ with N in position 1 or 2 or 5.

With N in position 1: N ? I A ? 
As before, hard to find. ""NUBIA"" - N U B I A -> third is B, not I -> no.

With N in position 2: ? N I A ? 
""UNITY"" has T and Y, but no A? Pattern: ? N I A ? 
""UNICA"" has C -> invalid.
""ONCIA"" - O N C I A -> has C -> invalid.
""INIAL"" not a word.

With N in position 5: ? ? I A N
""MEDIA"" has E -> invalid.
""LOTIA"" not a word.
""BATIK"" has B,T,K, but no N? We need N in position 5? Pattern: ? ? I A N, so the fifth letter is N.
Words: ""URBAN"" has R -> invalid.
""PAGAN"" has A in position 2 -> invalid.
""KAPAN"" not common.

""TITAN"" - T I T A N -> but third letter is T, not I -> no.

""MAYAN"" - M A Y A N -> A in position 2 -> invalid.

So it's difficult. Perhaps ""ALIGN"" is a good choice.

Another idea: we know A must be in 1 or 4, so we can choose a word that tests A in position 1, and N in a new position.

""ALIGN"": A L I G N

This way:
- A in position 1: if it's correct, we get ✓; if not, then A must be in position 4 (since we know it's not in 2 or 5).
- N in position 5: we haven't tested position 5 for N before (we tested position 4 and it was wrong).
- Also, we test L and G.

If we get feedback that A is correct in position 1, then great. If not, then we know A is in position 4.

Similarly for N.

So I think ""ALIGN"" is a reasonable guess.

But note: we have to make sure the word is valid. ""ALIGN"" is a valid English word.

Another common word: ""OPIUM"" - O P I U M -> but no A or N? We must include A and N because they are in the word.

We must include the known letters: A, I, N. I is fixed, but A and N are in the word and must be included to get their positions.

So the guess must contain A and N.

""ALIGN"" contains A and N.

So I'll go with that.

But let's see if there's a word that tests A in position 4.

For example, ""DELIA"" has E -> invalid.

""MANIA"" - M A N I A -> A in position 2 -> invalid.

""RADII"" has R -> invalid.

So ""ALIGN"" seems good.

Another candidate: ""TAKING"" is 6 letters, no.

""BAYOU"" has no I.

So <guess>ALIGN</guess>
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: 
     - R (x) → Not in the word.
     - A (-) → In the word but wrong position (not position 2).
     - I (✓) → Correct and in position 3.
     - S (x) → Not in the word.
     - E (x) → Not in the word.
   - **Guess 2 (CHINA)**:
     - C (x) → Not in the word.
     - H (x) → Not in the word.
     - I (✓) → Correct and in position 3 (confirmed).
     - N (-) → In the word but wrong position (not position 4).
     - A (-) → In the word but wrong position (not position 5).

2. **Key Deductions**:
   - **Fixed Position**: The third letter is **I** (from both guesses).
   - **Confirmed Letters in Word**: 
     - **A** is in the word but not in positions 2 or 5 (from RAISE and CHINA feedback).
     - **N** is in the word but not in position 4 (from CHINA feedback).
   - **Eliminated Letters**: R, S, E, C, H (all marked ""x"").
   - **Possible Positions for A and N**:
     - **A**: Must be in position 1 or 4 (since positions 2 and 5 are invalid).
     - **N**: Must be in position 1, 2, or 5 (since position 4 is invalid, and position 3 is occupied by I).
   - **Unknown Letters**: Two additional letters are needed (positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 are open, but A and N will occupy two of these). The word has exactly 5 distinct letters or duplicates? Unknown, but feedback hasn't shown duplicates yet.

3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:
   - Test **A in position 1** (since position 4 is the only alternative if this fails).
   - Test **N in position 5** (a new position; positions 1 and 2 are also possible but not tested here to avoid conflict with A).
   - Introduce **new common consonants** (e.g., L, G) to gather more information.
   - Avoid eliminated letters (R, S, E, C, H).
   - **Word Choice**: ""ALIGN"" fits perfectly:
     - A in position 1 (tests if A is in position 1).
     - N in position 5 (tests if N is in position 5).
     - I in position 3 (fixed).
     - Uses new letters L (position 2) and G (position 4) for additional feedback.
     - Valid 5-letter word.

4. **Expected Outcomes**:
   - If A is ✓ in position 1, then A is confirmed at the start.
   - If A is (-), then A must be in position 4 (the only remaining option).
   - N in position 5 will reveal if N is correctly placed or misplaced.
   - Feedback on L and G will help identify the remaining letters.

<guess>ALIGN</guess>",ALIGN,"We are given feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- I: ✓ (correct position, so the third letter is I)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: CHINA
- C: x (not in the word)
- H: x (not in the word)
- I: ✓ (correct position, third letter is I, which we already knew)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)

From this, we know:
- The secret word has the letter I in the third position: _ _ I _ _
- The secret word contains A and N, but not in the positions we guessed.
  - For A: In RAISE, A was in position 2, but it was wrong position. In CHINA, A was in position 5, also wrong position. So A is not in position 2 or 5. Since the word is 5 letters, A must be in position 1 or 4.
  - For N: In CHINA, N was in position 4, but it was wrong position. So N is in the word but not in position 4. It could be in position 1, 2, or 5 (but note position 3 is I, so not there).
- Letters not in the word: R, S, E, C, H (from the x's).

Also, we know the word has A and N, and I, and two more letters we haven't found yet.

We need to form a new guess that:
- Has I in the third position.
- Includes A and N, but in positions we haven't tried for them (for A: not 2 or 5, so must be 1 or 4; for N: not 4, so must be 1, 2, or 5).
- Avoids the letters R, S, E, C, H.

We also want to test new common letters to get more information.

Possible positions:
- A must be in position 1 or 4.
- N must be in position 1, 2, or 5.

But note: if A is in position 1, then N cannot be in position 1 (since one letter per position). Similarly, if A is in position 4, then N cannot be in position 4 (which we already know).

We can consider two cases for A: position 1 or 4.

We also need to choose a word that is valid and uses common letters.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern and constraints.

First, if A is in position 1: A _ I _ _
We need to place N in one of 2, 4, or 5, but avoiding position 4 for N? No, we only know N is not in position 4 from the previous guess, but in this new word, if we put N in position 4, that would be the same as before? Actually, we know N is not in position 4 of the secret word, so in our guess, if we put N in position 4, it would be wrong, but we are trying to find where N is.

But we are allowed to put N in any position except we know it's not in 4 in the secret word, so in our guess, we can put it in 1,2,5 to test.

Similarly for A.

But to maximize information, we should try to put A in a position we haven't tested (so either 1 or 4) and N in a position we haven't tested (so 1,2,5) but avoiding the known bad positions for the secret.

Since we have two possibilities for A, we can choose one to test.

Also, we need two more letters for the remaining positions.

Let me list possible words:

Option 1: A in position 1.
Pattern: A _ I _ _
We need to fill positions 2,4,5 with letters that are not R,S,E,C,H, and include N in one of 2,4,5.

Possible words:
- A?I?N: e.g., ""ADMIN"" - but D and M are new, and N in position 5. Also, check if valid: ADMIN is a word. But we have to avoid R,S,E,C,H, which we are. However, in ADMIN, position 4 is I? No: A D M I N -> positions: 1:A, 2:D, 3:M, 4:I, 5:N -> but we need I in position 3, so that would be A D I ...? ADMIN has M in position 3, not I. So no.

We need the third letter to be I, so pattern: A _ I _ _

So for example:
- A N I _ _ -> but N in position 2? Then we have A N I ? ? 
  Words: ""ANVIL"" - A N V I L -> but third letter is V, not I -> no.
  ""ANIMI"" - not common, and third letter is M? A N I M I -> positions: 1:A, 2:N, 3:I, 4:M, 5:I -> that works. But ""ANIMI"" is plural of animus? Not very common, and we have two I's? The secret might have duplicate letters, but we don't know.

But let's avoid obscure words.

- A ? I N ? -> with N in position 4? But we know N is not in position 4 in the secret, so if we put N in position 4, it will be wrong, but we can do it to test? Actually, we want to use the guess to find the position, so we should put N in a position that might be correct, i.e., 1,2, or 5.

So for A in position 1 and N in position 2: A N I ? ? 
Words: ""ANION"" - A N I O N -> but that has two N's? And O. Positions: 1:A, 2:N, 3:I, 4:O, 5:N. This is a valid word (an ion is a type of atom). And it avoids R,S,E,C,H.

But we have N in position 2 and 5. We don't know if the secret has duplicate N.

Alternatively, ""ANIMA"" - A N I M A -> but M and A. But A is already in position 1, and we are putting A in position 5? But we know A is not in position 5 from previous feedback (in CHINA, A was in 5 and got - meaning not in 5). So we cannot put A in position 5 again? We can, but it would be a waste because we know it's not there. So better to avoid position 5 for A.

Similarly, for N, we don't know about position 5 yet.

But in ""ANION"", we have A in 1, N in 2 and 5, I in 3, O in 4.

But we know A is not in 5, so the A in position 5 would be incorrect, but in the secret, if there is no second A, it would be marked x. But we don't know if there is a duplicate A.

To keep it simple, let's avoid duplicate letters for now.

Another word: A ? I ? N with N in position 5: A _ I _ N
Words: ""AXIIN"" not a word.
""ALIEN"" but E is not allowed (we know E is not in the word).
""AVIAN"" - A V I A N -> positions: 1:A, 2:V, 3:I, 4:A, 5:N. This has A in 1 and 4. But we are testing A in position 1, and also position 4? But we know A is in the word, and if it's in position 1, then position 4 might be another A or not.

But ""AVIAN"" is a valid word. And it avoids R,S,E,C,H.

Now, if A is in position 4: pattern: _ _ I A _
We need to fill positions 1,2,5 with letters not R,S,E,C,H, and include N in one of 1,2,5.

For example:
- N in position 1: N _ I A _
  Words: ""NOMIA"" - N O M I A -> but third is M, not I -> no.
  ""NIVAL"" - N I V A L -> third is V, not I -> no.
  We need third to be I, so: N ? I A ? 
  Words: ""NAIAD"" - N A I A D -> but A is in position 2, which we know is not allowed (A not in position 2 from first guess). So invalid.
  ""NAIRA"" - N A I R A -> has R, which is not allowed (R is eliminated). Also, A in position 2 again.

- N in position 2: _ N I A _
  Words: ""UNICA"" - U N I C A -> but C is eliminated -> invalid.
  ""ONIUM"" - O N I U M -> but U and M. Valid? Onium is a chemistry term. Avoids bad letters. So ""ONIUM"" could work, but it has O, N, I, U, M.

- N in position 5: _ _ I A N
  Words: ""MAJOR"" but has R and J? Not allowed.
  ""LABIA"" - L A B I A -> but A in position 2 -> invalid.
  ""TOLAR"" has R -> invalid.
  ""KAPUT"" has K and P, U, T -> but no N? We need N in position 5. Pattern: _ _ I A N
  Words: ""URBAN"" - U R B A N -> has R -> invalid.
  ""PAGAN"" - P A G A N -> A in position 2 -> invalid.

It's hard to find words for A in position 4.

Another common word: ""DAILY"" but A in position 2 -> invalid.

So perhaps A in position 1 is easier.

Back to A in position 1: we have ""AVIAN"" as a candidate: A V I A N
But in ""AVIAN"", we have A in position 1 and 4. We know A is not in position 5, but position 4 is possible. Also, N in position 5.

But we are testing A in position 1 and 4? We don't know if there are two A's.

Another candidate: ""ADMIN"" doesn't work because of the third letter.

What about ""AXION"" - A X I O N -> positions: 1:A, 2:X, 3:I, 4:O, 5:N. This avoids bad letters. And it tests A in 1, N in 5.

Similarly, ""AVION"" - A V I O N -> same pattern.

""AVION"" is a word? It means aircraft, from French, but in English, it might be accepted.

But let's stick to common words.

""ANVIL"" has I in third? A N V I L -> third is V, not I.

""ALIGN"" - A L I G N -> positions: 1:A, 2:L, 3:I, 4:G, 5:N. This is a good word. Avoids bad letters. Tests A in 1, N in 5.

But we know from CHINA that N is not in position 4, but in this guess, N is in position 5, which is a new position. Also, A is in position 1.

So ""ALIGN"" is a valid guess.

Similarly, ""ALBIN"" is not common.

""APING"" - A P I N G -> but N in position 4? We know N is not in position 4 in the secret, so if we put N in position 4, it will be wrong. But in ""APING"", N is in position 4, which we know is incorrect for the secret. So it would be better to put N in a position that could be correct, like 2 or 5.

In ""ALIGN"", N is in position 5, which is untested.

Another word: ""AMINO"" - A M I N O -> positions: 1:A, 2:M, 3:I, 4:N, 5:O. But N is in position 4, which we know is not correct for the secret (from CHINA feedback: N in position 4 got - meaning not in that position). So if we put N in position 4 again, it will be wrong, and we don't gain new information about N's position. We should avoid that.

So ""AMINO"" is not good because it puts N in position 4 again.

Similarly, we should avoid putting A in position 5 because we know it's not there.

So back to ""ALIGN"": A in 1, N in 5, and new letters L and G.

We also have the option to test A in position 4.

But let's see if we can find a word with A in position 4.

For example: _ _ I A _ with N in position 1 or 2 or 5.

With N in position 1: N ? I A ? 
As before, hard to find. ""NUBIA"" - N U B I A -> third is B, not I -> no.

With N in position 2: ? N I A ? 
""UNITY"" has T and Y, but no A? Pattern: ? N I A ? 
""UNICA"" has C -> invalid.
""ONCIA"" - O N C I A -> has C -> invalid.
""INIAL"" not a word.

With N in position 5: ? ? I A N
""MEDIA"" has E -> invalid.
""LOTIA"" not a word.
""BATIK"" has B,T,K, but no N? We need N in position 5? Pattern: ? ? I A N, so the fifth letter is N.
Words: ""URBAN"" has R -> invalid.
""PAGAN"" has A in position 2 -> invalid.
""KAPAN"" not common.

""TITAN"" - T I T A N -> but third letter is T, not I -> no.

""MAYAN"" - M A Y A N -> A in position 2 -> invalid.

So it's difficult. Perhaps ""ALIGN"" is a good choice.

Another idea: we know A must be in 1 or 4, so we can choose a word that tests A in position 1, and N in a new position.

""ALIGN"": A L I G N

This way:
- A in position 1: if it's correct, we get ✓; if not, then A must be in position 4 (since we know it's not in 2 or 5).
- N in position 5: we haven't tested position 5 for N before (we tested position 4 and it was wrong).
- Also, we test L and G.

If we get feedback that A is correct in position 1, then great. If not, then we know A is in position 4.

Similarly for N.

So I think ""ALIGN"" is a reasonable guess.

But note: we have to make sure the word is valid. ""ALIGN"" is a valid English word.

Another common word: ""OPIUM"" - O P I U M -> but no A or N? We must include A and N because they are in the word.

We must include the known letters: A, I, N. I is fixed, but A and N are in the word and must be included to get their positions.

So the guess must contain A and N.

""ALIGN"" contains A and N.

So I'll go with that.

But let's see if there's a word that tests A in position 4.

For example, ""DELIA"" has E -> invalid.

""MANIA"" - M A N I A -> A in position 2 -> invalid.

""RADII"" has R -> invalid.

So ""ALIGN"" seems good.

Another candidate: ""TAKING"" is 6 letters, no.

""BAYOU"" has no I.

So <guess>ALIGN</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: 
     - R (x) → Not in the word.
     - A (-) → In the word but wrong position (not position 2).
     - I (✓) → Correct and in position 3.
     - S (x) → Not in the word.
     - E (x) → Not in the word.
   - **Guess 2 (CHINA)**:
     - C (x) → Not in the word.
     - H (x) → Not in the word.
     - I (✓) → Correct and in position 3 (confirmed).
     - N (-) → In the word but wrong position (not position 4).
     - A (-) → In the word but wrong position (not position 5).

2. **Key Deductions**:
   - **Fixed Position**: The third letter is **I** (from both guesses).
   - **Confirmed Letters in Word**: 
     - **A** is in the word but not in positions 2 or 5 (from RAISE and CHINA feedback).
     - **N** is in the word but not in position 4 (from CHINA feedback).
   - **Eliminated Letters**: R, S, E, C, H (all marked ""x"").
   - **Possible Positions for A and N**:
     - **A**: Must be in position 1 or 4 (since positions 2 and 5 are invalid).
     - **N**: Must be in position 1, 2, or 5 (since position 4 is invalid, and position 3 is occupied by I).
   - **Unknown Letters**: Two additional letters are needed (positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 are open, but A and N will occupy two of these). The word has exactly 5 distinct letters or duplicates? Unknown, but feedback hasn't shown duplicates yet.

3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:
   - Test **A in position 1** (since position 4 is the only alternative if this fails).
   - Test **N in position 5** (a new position; positions 1 and 2 are also possible but not tested here to avoid conflict with A).
   - Introduce **new common consonants** (e.g., L, G) to gather more information.
   - Avoid eliminated letters (R, S, E, C, H).
   - **Word Choice**: ""ALIGN"" fits perfectly:
     - A in position 1 (tests if A is in position 1).
     - N in position 5 (tests if N is in position 5).
     - I in position 3 (fixed).
     - Uses new letters L (position 2) and G (position 4) for additional feedback.
     - Valid 5-letter word.

4. **Expected Outcomes**:
   - If A is ✓ in position 1, then A is confirmed at the start.
   - If A is (-), then A must be in position 4 (the only remaining option).
   - N in position 5 will reveal if N is correctly placed or misplaced.
   - Feedback on L and G will help identify the remaining letters.",Guess 3: ALIGN -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) L(x) I(✓) G(x) N(✓),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. For the first guess, we want a word that can test as many common letters as possible. 
 This strategy helps in gathering maximum information about the secret word.
 Common vowels and consonants in English are: A, E, I, O, U, and common consonants include R, S, T, L, N, etc.

 One popular starting word is ""CRATE"" because it contains common letters: C, R, A, T, E.
 However, note that the word must be 5 letters and valid.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is another good starter, containing S, L, A, T, E.

 But let's consider: we want to cover as many frequent letters as possible. The word ""ROATE"" is also known to be good, but let me think.

 Another common one is ""RAISE"" which has R, A, I, S, E. It covers four vowels and a common consonant.

 However, note that the feedback symbols will tell us not only presence but also position. 

 Since we are at the first guess, any word that uses common letters is acceptable. I will choose ""RAISE"".

 Let me check: ""RAISE"" is a valid English word.

 So my first guess is ""RAISE"".For the first guess, I need a word that uses common letters to maximize information. A strong starting word should include frequent vowels (A, E, I) and common consonants (R, S) to test multiple possibilities. ""RAISE"" fits this well—it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), covering five distinct letters to quickly identify matches.

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(✓) S(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- I: ✓ (correct position)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
1. The letter 'I' is in the word and it is in the 3rd position (since in ""RAISE"", I is the third letter).
2. The letter 'A' is in the word, but not in the second position (where we placed it). It must be in one of the other positions: 1, 4, or 5? But note: the word is 5 letters, so positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. We know position 3 is 'I', so A cannot be there. Also, A is not in position 2, so it must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
3. The letters R, S, and E are not in the word at all. So we can avoid using these letters in future guesses.

Therefore, the secret word:
- Must have 'I' in the 3rd position.
- Must contain the letter 'A', but not in the 2nd position (so in 1st, 4th, or 5th).
- Does not contain R, S, E.

We also know that the word is 5 letters and a valid English word.

For the next guess, we want to test possible positions for 'A' and also try to include other common letters that haven't been ruled out.

Common letters that are still available: we can use letters like T, N, O, L, C, D, U, M, P, etc. (avoiding R, S, E).

We also want to consider that 'A' must be in the word, so we can try to place it in a different position.

Possible positions for 'A':
- Position 1: first letter
- Position 4: fourth letter
- Position 5: fifth letter

We can design a guess that tests one of these positions and also includes new common letters.

Let's think of words that:
- Have 'I' in the third position.
- Include an 'A' in either position 1, 4, or 5 (but not 2, and we know it's not 3 because that's I).
- Avoid R, S, E.

Also, we want to use as many new common letters as possible to get more information.

Let me list some words that fit:

Option 1: Place 'A' in position 1.
Words: A?I?? 
Example: ""ACTIN"" - but we don't know if that's valid? Actually, we need common words.

But note: we don't have to get the whole word right, just test.

Another idea: We can try to test multiple possibilities at once.

Let me think of words that have 'I' in the third position and include 'A' in position 4 or 5, and also include other common letters.

For example, if we put 'A' in position 4: 
Pattern: ? ? I A ?

Words: ""BLACK"" but that has 'C' and 'K', and also 'B' and 'L'. But note: we don't have any information about these yet.

But we must avoid R, S, E.

Another word: ""CHINA"" - but that has 'H' and 'N', and 'A' in the fourth position? 
C H I N A -> positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:I, 4:N, 5:A -> so 'A' is in position 5, not 4. But we can test position 5.

Alternatively, for position 4: ""MEDIA"" but that has E which is ruled out -> not allowed because E is not in the word.

We must avoid E, so ""MEDIA"" is invalid because it contains E.

Another word: ""MANIA"" - but that has M, A, N, I, A. 
M A N I A -> positions: 1:M, 2:A, 3:N? -> no, we need I in the third. So ""MANIA"" is M A N I A -> third letter is N, not I.

We need the third letter to be I.

So: ? ? I ? ?

And we want to include A in position 1, 4, or 5.

Also, avoid R, S, E.

Let me try to find words with pattern: 
- If A in position 1: A ? I ? ?
  Examples: ""ACTIN"" (A C T I N) - valid? ACTIN is a word (a type of protein). But let's see if we can find more common words.
  ""ADMIN"" (A D M I N) - but that has D, M, N. And I in third? A D M I N -> positions: 1:A, 2:D, 3:M -> no, third is M, not I.

We need the third letter to be I. So the pattern is: [letter1] [letter2] I [letter4] [letter5]

So for A in position 1: A [letter2] I [letter4] [letter5]

Words: 
- ""AEGIS"" -> but has E and S, which are ruled out -> invalid.
- ""ALBIN"" -> not common, and has L, B, N.
- ""AXIOM"" -> has X, O, M. But also has O? A X I O M -> that's A in 1, X in 2, I in 3, O in 4, M in 5. And no R,S,E. So ""AXIOM"" is a valid word.

But is ""AXIOM"" common? Yes.

Now, if we put A in position 4: pattern: [letter1] [letter2] I A [letter5]
Words: 
- ""OPTIC"" -> O P T I C -> third is T, not I -> no.
- We need third to be I, so: [letter1] [letter2] I A [letter5]
  Example: ""CAMIA"" -> not common? 
  ""DELIA"" -> has E -> invalid.
  ""HELIA"" -> has E and H -> invalid because of E? Actually, E is not allowed at all because it's not in the secret word. So any word with E is invalid.

We must avoid E, so words with E are not allowed.

Another: ""TACIT"" -> T A C I T -> third is C, not I -> no.

Pattern for A in position 4: [letter1] [letter2] I A [letter5]
Example: ""UTICA"" -> U T I C A -> that's U in 1, T in 2, I in 3, C in 4, A in 5? Wait, position 4 is C, and A is in position 5. So that's not A in position 4.

We want A in position 4: so the fourth letter must be A.

So: [letter1] [letter2] I A [letter5]
Example: ""CIVIC"" -> C I V I C -> third is V? No, positions: 1:C, 2:I, 3:V, 4:I, 5:C -> not I in third? Wait, we need third to be I, so that's fixed.

So: [letter1] [letter2] I A [letter5]
- ""FOLIA"" -> F O L I A -> third is L, not I -> no.
- ""MAGIC"" -> M A G I C -> third is G, not I -> no.

It's hard to find words with I in third and A in fourth.

Similarly, for A in position 5: pattern: [letter1] [letter2] I [letter4] A
Examples: 
- ""ALPHA"" -> A L P H A -> third is P, not I -> no.
- ""BONZA"" -> B O N Z A -> third is N -> no.
- ""CHINA"" -> C H I N A -> third is I, and fifth is A. So that works. And no R,S,E.

So ""CHINA"" is a candidate.

Another: ""TIBIA"" -> T I B I A -> third is B? No: positions: 1:T, 2:I, 3:B, 4:I, 5:A -> third is B, not I.

We need the third letter to be I, so: [letter1] [letter2] I [letter4] A
- ""CHINA"": C H I N A -> 1:C, 2:H, 3:I, 4:N, 5:A -> perfect.
- ""THYMI"" -> not a word? Thymi is plural of thymus, but usually not 5 letters? And it ends with I, not A.

Another: ""CAMPA"" -> not a word? 
""JIAOS"" -> has S -> invalid.

So ""CHINA"" is a good candidate.

But note: we also want to test other common letters. In ""CHINA"", we are testing C, H, N, and we already know I and A.

But we are not testing the position of A very well because we are putting it at the end. However, we know A is not in position 2, and we are testing position 5.

Alternatively, we could test A in position 1. We had ""AXIOM"" as a candidate.

Let me compare:
- ""AXIOM"": tests A in position 1, and also X, O, M. 
- ""CHINA"": tests A in position 5, and C, H, N.

Both are valid and avoid R, S, E.

We also have the option to test A in position 4, but we couldn't find a common word. So let's not force that.

Another candidate: ""ABOIL"" -> not common.

Or ""ADMIT"" -> A D M I T -> third is M, not I -> no.

So between ""AXIOM"" and ""CHINA"", which one uses more common letters? 
Common letters: T, N, O, L, C, D, U, M, P, H, etc.

""CHINA"" has C, H, N -> N is very common.
""AXIOM"" has X (rare), O, M.

So ""CHINA"" might be better because N is more common than X.

But we also want to test the position of A. Since we know A is in the word but not in position 2, and we have position 1,4,5 as possibilities. 

In ""CHINA"", we are testing A in position 5. If we get feedback that A is not in position 5, then we know it must be in 1 or 4.

Similarly, in ""AXIOM"", we test A in position 1.

But note: we are also testing other letters. We might get more information from ""CHINA"" because N is common.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't put A in a fixed position but uses it in a position we haven't tested? But we have to put it somewhere.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has A in a position we haven't tested (so not position 2) and also includes other common letters.

But we have to have I in the third.

Let me think of other words with I in third and A somewhere else.

For example: ""DAILY"" -> D A I L Y -> third is I? Positions: 1:D, 2:A, 3:I -> but A is in position 2, which we know is not allowed because the feedback said A is not in position 2. So we cannot put A in position 2 again.

So we must avoid position 2 for A.

Therefore, in ""DAILY"", we are putting A in position 2, which is invalid because we know A is not in position 2. So that guess would be wasting a letter.

So we must not put A in position 2.

Therefore, for the next guess, we must have:
- Third letter: I
- A in position 1, 4, or 5.
- No R, S, E.

And we want to test as many new common letters as possible.

Another candidate: ""PAINT"" -> P A I N T -> third is I? Positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:I -> but A is in position 2, which is not allowed. So invalid.

Similarly, ""MAINS"" -> has S -> invalid.

""TALIK"" -> not common.

""VALID"" -> has L, I, D. But V A L I D -> third is L, not I -> no.

""OCTIC"" -> not common.

""LIPID"" -> L I P I D -> third is P, not I -> no.

So let's go with ""CHINA"" or ""AXIOM"". 

I think ""CHINA"" is a better choice because it has more common letters (C, H, N) and avoids very rare letters like X.

So I'll go with ""CHINA"".

But note: we are also testing the presence of C, H, N. If any of these are in the word, we'll get feedback.

Also, if A is in position 5, we'll get a check for A; if not, we'll get a minus or an x.

Similarly, we know I is already correct, so that will be a check.

So let's guess ""CHINA"".

But wait, what if the word has duplicate letters? We don't know, but the feedback will tell us.

So the next guess: ""CHINA""

We'll get feedback on each letter.

But note: we are using the letter A again, which we know is in the word, but we are testing its position.

This is acceptable.

So I choose ""CHINA"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, S, and E are not in the secret word (x).
- A is in the word but not in the second position (-).
- I is in the word and correctly placed in the third position (✓).

Key deductions:
- The secret word must have 'I' in the third position.
- It contains 'A' but not in position 1, 2, or 5 (since it was misplaced in position 2, and positions 1 and 5 were not tested yet; it could be in position 4).
- R, S, and E are eliminated, so the new guess must avoid these letters.
- The goal is to test 'A' in a new position (position 1, 4, or 5) while introducing common unused letters (e.g., C, H, N, T, O) to gather more information.

After evaluating options:
- ""CHINA"" fits the criteria: 
  - 'I' is in the third position.
  - 'A' is tested in position 5 (a new position to check).
  - Avoids R, S, E.
  - Introduces common letters C, H, and N for additional feedback.

This guess will help narrow down the position of 'A' and reveal if any of C, H, or N are in the word.

<guess>CHINA</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(✓) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CHINA -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) I(✓) N(-) A(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- I: ✓ (correct position, so the third letter is I)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: CHINA
- C: x (not in the word)
- H: x (not in the word)
- I: ✓ (correct position, third letter is I, which we already knew)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)

From this, we know:
- The secret word has the letter I in the third position: _ _ I _ _
- The secret word contains A and N, but not in the positions we guessed.
  - For A: In RAISE, A was in position 2, but it was wrong position. In CHINA, A was in position 5, also wrong position. So A is not in position 2 or 5. Since the word is 5 letters, A must be in position 1 or 4.
  - For N: In CHINA, N was in position 4, but it was wrong position. So N is in the word but not in position 4. It could be in position 1, 2, or 5 (but note position 3 is I, so not there).
- Letters not in the word: R, S, E, C, H (from the x's).

Also, we know the word has A and N, and I, and two more letters we haven't found yet.

We need to form a new guess that:
- Has I in the third position.
- Includes A and N, but in positions we haven't tried for them (for A: not 2 or 5, so must be 1 or 4; for N: not 4, so must be 1, 2, or 5).
- Avoids the letters R, S, E, C, H.

We also want to test new common letters to get more information.

Possible positions:
- A must be in position 1 or 4.
- N must be in position 1, 2, or 5.

But note: if A is in position 1, then N cannot be in position 1 (since one letter per position). Similarly, if A is in position 4, then N cannot be in position 4 (which we already know).

We can consider two cases for A: position 1 or 4.

We also need to choose a word that is valid and uses common letters.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern and constraints.

First, if A is in position 1: A _ I _ _
We need to place N in one of 2, 4, or 5, but avoiding position 4 for N? No, we only know N is not in position 4 from the previous guess, but in this new word, if we put N in position 4, that would be the same as before? Actually, we know N is not in position 4 of the secret word, so in our guess, if we put N in position 4, it would be wrong, but we are trying to find where N is.

But we are allowed to put N in any position except we know it's not in 4 in the secret word, so in our guess, we can put it in 1,2,5 to test.

Similarly for A.

But to maximize information, we should try to put A in a position we haven't tested (so either 1 or 4) and N in a position we haven't tested (so 1,2,5) but avoiding the known bad positions for the secret.

Since we have two possibilities for A, we can choose one to test.

Also, we need two more letters for the remaining positions.

Let me list possible words:

Option 1: A in position 1.
Pattern: A _ I _ _
We need to fill positions 2,4,5 with letters that are not R,S,E,C,H, and include N in one of 2,4,5.

Possible words:
- A?I?N: e.g., ""ADMIN"" - but D and M are new, and N in position 5. Also, check if valid: ADMIN is a word. But we have to avoid R,S,E,C,H, which we are. However, in ADMIN, position 4 is I? No: A D M I N -> positions: 1:A, 2:D, 3:M, 4:I, 5:N -> but we need I in position 3, so that would be A D I ...? ADMIN has M in position 3, not I. So no.

We need the third letter to be I, so pattern: A _ I _ _

So for example:
- A N I _ _ -> but N in position 2? Then we have A N I ? ? 
  Words: ""ANVIL"" - A N V I L -> but third letter is V, not I -> no.
  ""ANIMI"" - not common, and third letter is M? A N I M I -> positions: 1:A, 2:N, 3:I, 4:M, 5:I -> that works. But ""ANIMI"" is plural of animus? Not very common, and we have two I's? The secret might have duplicate letters, but we don't know.

But let's avoid obscure words.

- A ? I N ? -> with N in position 4? But we know N is not in position 4 in the secret, so if we put N in position 4, it will be wrong, but we can do it to test? Actually, we want to use the guess to find the position, so we should put N in a position that might be correct, i.e., 1,2, or 5.

So for A in position 1 and N in position 2: A N I ? ? 
Words: ""ANION"" - A N I O N -> but that has two N's? And O. Positions: 1:A, 2:N, 3:I, 4:O, 5:N. This is a valid word (an ion is a type of atom). And it avoids R,S,E,C,H.

But we have N in position 2 and 5. We don't know if the secret has duplicate N.

Alternatively, ""ANIMA"" - A N I M A -> but M and A. But A is already in position 1, and we are putting A in position 5? But we know A is not in position 5 from previous feedback (in CHINA, A was in 5 and got - meaning not in 5). So we cannot put A in position 5 again? We can, but it would be a waste because we know it's not there. So better to avoid position 5 for A.

Similarly, for N, we don't know about position 5 yet.

But in ""ANION"", we have A in 1, N in 2 and 5, I in 3, O in 4.

But we know A is not in 5, so the A in position 5 would be incorrect, but in the secret, if there is no second A, it would be marked x. But we don't know if there is a duplicate A.

To keep it simple, let's avoid duplicate letters for now.

Another word: A ? I ? N with N in position 5: A _ I _ N
Words: ""AXIIN"" not a word.
""ALIEN"" but E is not allowed (we know E is not in the word).
""AVIAN"" - A V I A N -> positions: 1:A, 2:V, 3:I, 4:A, 5:N. This has A in 1 and 4. But we are testing A in position 1, and also position 4? But we know A is in the word, and if it's in position 1, then position 4 might be another A or not.

But ""AVIAN"" is a valid word. And it avoids R,S,E,C,H.

Now, if A is in position 4: pattern: _ _ I A _
We need to fill positions 1,2,5 with letters not R,S,E,C,H, and include N in one of 1,2,5.

For example:
- N in position 1: N _ I A _
  Words: ""NOMIA"" - N O M I A -> but third is M, not I -> no.
  ""NIVAL"" - N I V A L -> third is V, not I -> no.
  We need third to be I, so: N ? I A ? 
  Words: ""NAIAD"" - N A I A D -> but A is in position 2, which we know is not allowed (A not in position 2 from first guess). So invalid.
  ""NAIRA"" - N A I R A -> has R, which is not allowed (R is eliminated). Also, A in position 2 again.

- N in position 2: _ N I A _
  Words: ""UNICA"" - U N I C A -> but C is eliminated -> invalid.
  ""ONIUM"" - O N I U M -> but U and M. Valid? Onium is a chemistry term. Avoids bad letters. So ""ONIUM"" could work, but it has O, N, I, U, M.

- N in position 5: _ _ I A N
  Words: ""MAJOR"" but has R and J? Not allowed.
  ""LABIA"" - L A B I A -> but A in position 2 -> invalid.
  ""TOLAR"" has R -> invalid.
  ""KAPUT"" has K and P, U, T -> but no N? We need N in position 5. Pattern: _ _ I A N
  Words: ""URBAN"" - U R B A N -> has R -> invalid.
  ""PAGAN"" - P A G A N -> A in position 2 -> invalid.

It's hard to find words for A in position 4.

Another common word: ""DAILY"" but A in position 2 -> invalid.

So perhaps A in position 1 is easier.

Back to A in position 1: we have ""AVIAN"" as a candidate: A V I A N
But in ""AVIAN"", we have A in position 1 and 4. We know A is not in position 5, but position 4 is possible. Also, N in position 5.

But we are testing A in position 1 and 4? We don't know if there are two A's.

Another candidate: ""ADMIN"" doesn't work because of the third letter.

What about ""AXION"" - A X I O N -> positions: 1:A, 2:X, 3:I, 4:O, 5:N. This avoids bad letters. And it tests A in 1, N in 5.

Similarly, ""AVION"" - A V I O N -> same pattern.

""AVION"" is a word? It means aircraft, from French, but in English, it might be accepted.

But let's stick to common words.

""ANVIL"" has I in third? A N V I L -> third is V, not I.

""ALIGN"" - A L I G N -> positions: 1:A, 2:L, 3:I, 4:G, 5:N. This is a good word. Avoids bad letters. Tests A in 1, N in 5.

But we know from CHINA that N is not in position 4, but in this guess, N is in position 5, which is a new position. Also, A is in position 1.

So ""ALIGN"" is a valid guess.

Similarly, ""ALBIN"" is not common.

""APING"" - A P I N G -> but N in position 4? We know N is not in position 4 in the secret, so if we put N in position 4, it will be wrong. But in ""APING"", N is in position 4, which we know is incorrect for the secret. So it would be better to put N in a position that could be correct, like 2 or 5.

In ""ALIGN"", N is in position 5, which is untested.

Another word: ""AMINO"" - A M I N O -> positions: 1:A, 2:M, 3:I, 4:N, 5:O. But N is in position 4, which we know is not correct for the secret (from CHINA feedback: N in position 4 got - meaning not in that position). So if we put N in position 4 again, it will be wrong, and we don't gain new information about N's position. We should avoid that.

So ""AMINO"" is not good because it puts N in position 4 again.

Similarly, we should avoid putting A in position 5 because we know it's not there.

So back to ""ALIGN"": A in 1, N in 5, and new letters L and G.

We also have the option to test A in position 4.

But let's see if we can find a word with A in position 4.

For example: _ _ I A _ with N in position 1 or 2 or 5.

With N in position 1: N ? I A ? 
As before, hard to find. ""NUBIA"" - N U B I A -> third is B, not I -> no.

With N in position 2: ? N I A ? 
""UNITY"" has T and Y, but no A? Pattern: ? N I A ? 
""UNICA"" has C -> invalid.
""ONCIA"" - O N C I A -> has C -> invalid.
""INIAL"" not a word.

With N in position 5: ? ? I A N
""MEDIA"" has E -> invalid.
""LOTIA"" not a word.
""BATIK"" has B,T,K, but no N? We need N in position 5? Pattern: ? ? I A N, so the fifth letter is N.
Words: ""URBAN"" has R -> invalid.
""PAGAN"" has A in position 2 -> invalid.
""KAPAN"" not common.

""TITAN"" - T I T A N -> but third letter is T, not I -> no.

""MAYAN"" - M A Y A N -> A in position 2 -> invalid.

So it's difficult. Perhaps ""ALIGN"" is a good choice.

Another idea: we know A must be in 1 or 4, so we can choose a word that tests A in position 1, and N in a new position.

""ALIGN"": A L I G N

This way:
- A in position 1: if it's correct, we get ✓; if not, then A must be in position 4 (since we know it's not in 2 or 5).
- N in position 5: we haven't tested position 5 for N before (we tested position 4 and it was wrong).
- Also, we test L and G.

If we get feedback that A is correct in position 1, then great. If not, then we know A is in position 4.

Similarly for N.

So I think ""ALIGN"" is a reasonable guess.

But note: we have to make sure the word is valid. ""ALIGN"" is a valid English word.

Another common word: ""OPIUM"" - O P I U M -> but no A or N? We must include A and N because they are in the word.

We must include the known letters: A, I, N. I is fixed, but A and N are in the word and must be included to get their positions.

So the guess must contain A and N.

""ALIGN"" contains A and N.

So I'll go with that.

But let's see if there's a word that tests A in position 4.

For example, ""DELIA"" has E -> invalid.

""MANIA"" - M A N I A -> A in position 2 -> invalid.

""RADII"" has R -> invalid.

So ""ALIGN"" seems good.

Another candidate: ""TAKING"" is 6 letters, no.

""BAYOU"" has no I.

So <guess>ALIGN</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: 
     - R (x) → Not in the word.
     - A (-) → In the word but wrong position (not position 2).
     - I (✓) → Correct and in position 3.
     - S (x) → Not in the word.
     - E (x) → Not in the word.
   - **Guess 2 (CHINA)**:
     - C (x) → Not in the word.
     - H (x) → Not in the word.
     - I (✓) → Correct and in position 3 (confirmed).
     - N (-) → In the word but wrong position (not position 4).
     - A (-) → In the word but wrong position (not position 5).

2. **Key Deductions**:
   - **Fixed Position**: The third letter is **I** (from both guesses).
   - **Confirmed Letters in Word**: 
     - **A** is in the word but not in positions 2 or 5 (from RAISE and CHINA feedback).
     - **N** is in the word but not in position 4 (from CHINA feedback).
   - **Eliminated Letters**: R, S, E, C, H (all marked ""x"").
   - **Possible Positions for A and N**:
     - **A**: Must be in position 1 or 4 (since positions 2 and 5 are invalid).
     - **N**: Must be in position 1, 2, or 5 (since position 4 is invalid, and position 3 is occupied by I).
   - **Unknown Letters**: Two additional letters are needed (positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 are open, but A and N will occupy two of these). The word has exactly 5 distinct letters or duplicates? Unknown, but feedback hasn't shown duplicates yet.

3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:
   - Test **A in position 1** (since position 4 is the only alternative if this fails).
   - Test **N in position 5** (a new position; positions 1 and 2 are also possible but not tested here to avoid conflict with A).
   - Introduce **new common consonants** (e.g., L, G) to gather more information.
   - Avoid eliminated letters (R, S, E, C, H).
   - **Word Choice**: ""ALIGN"" fits perfectly:
     - A in position 1 (tests if A is in position 1).
     - N in position 5 (tests if N is in position 5).
     - I in position 3 (fixed).
     - Uses new letters L (position 2) and G (position 4) for additional feedback.
     - Valid 5-letter word.

4. **Expected Outcomes**:
   - If A is ✓ in position 1, then A is confirmed at the start.
   - If A is (-), then A must be in position 4 (the only remaining option).
   - N in position 5 will reveal if N is correctly placed or misplaced.
   - Feedback on L and G will help identify the remaining letters.

So ""MANIA"" is M A N I A -> third letter is N, not I.\n\nWe need the third letter to be I.\n\nSo: ? ? I ? ?\n\nAnd we want to include A in position 1, 4, or 5.\n\nAlso, avoid R, S, E.\n\nLet me try to find words with pattern: \n- If A in position 1: A ? I ? ?\n  Examples: ""ACTIN"" (A C T I N) - valid? ACTIN is a word (a type of protein). But let\'s see if we can find more common words.\n  ""ADMIN"" (A D M I N) - but that has D, M, N. And I in third? A D M I N -> positions: 1:A, 2:D, 3:M -> no, third is M, not I.\n\nWe need the third letter to be I. So the pattern is: [letter1] [letter2] I [letter4] [letter5]\n\nSo for A in position 1: A [letter2] I [letter4] [letter5]\n\nWords: \n- ""AEGIS"" -> but has E and S, which are ruled out -> invalid.\n- ""ALBIN"" -> not common, and has L, B, N.\n- ""AXIOM"" -> has X, O, M. But also has O? A X I O M -> that\'s A in 1, X in 2, I in 3, O in 4, M in 5. And no R,S,E. So ""AXIOM"" is a valid word.\n\nBut is ""AXIOM"" common? Yes.\n\nNow, if we put A in position 4: pattern: [letter1] [letter2] I A [letter5]\nWords: \n- ""OPTIC"" -> O P T I C -> third is T, not I -> no.\n- We need third to be I, so: [letter1] [letter2] I A [letter5]\n  Example: ""CAMIA"" -> not common? \n  ""DELIA"" -> has E -> invalid.\n  ""HELIA"" -> has E and H -> invalid because of E? Actually, E is not allowed at all because it\'s not in the secret word. So any word with E is invalid.\n\nWe must avoid E, so words with E are not allowed.\n\nAnother: ""TACIT"" -> T A C I T -> third is C, not I -> no.\n\nPattern for A in position 4: [letter1] [letter2] I A [letter5]\nExample: ""UTICA"" -> U T I C A -> that\'s U in 1, T in 2, I in 3, C in 4, A in 5? Wait, position 4 is C, and A is in position 5. So that\'s not A in position 4.\n\nWe want A in position 4: so the fourth letter must be A.\n\nSo: [letter1] [letter2] I A [letter5]\nExample: ""CIVIC"" -> C I V I C -> third is V? No, positions: 1:C, 2:I, 3:V, 4:I, 5:C -> not I in third? Wait, we need third to be I, so that\'s fixed.\n\nSo: [letter1] [letter2] I A [letter5]\n- ""FOLIA"" -> F O L I A -> third is L, not I -> no.\n- ""MAGIC"" -> M A G I C -> third is G, not I -> no.\n\nIt\'s hard to find words with I in third and A in fourth.\n\nSimilarly, for A in position 5: pattern: [letter1] [letter2] I [letter4] A\nExamples: \n- ""ALPHA"" -> A L P H A -> third is P, not I -> no.\n- ""BONZA"" -> B O N Z A -> third is N -> no.\n- ""CHINA"" -> C H I N A -> third is I, and fifth is A. So that works. And no R,S,E.\n\nSo ""CHINA"" is a candidate.\n\nAnother: ""TIBIA"" -> T I B I A -> third is B? No: positions: 1:T, 2:I, 3:B, 4:I, 5:A -> third is B, not I.\n\nWe need the third letter to be I, so: [letter1] [letter2] I [letter4] A\n- ""CHINA"": C H I N A -> 1:C, 2:H, 3:I, 4:N, 5:A -> perfect.\n- ""THYMI"" -> not a word? Thymi is plural of thymus, but usually not 5 letters? And it ends with I, not A.\n\nAnother: ""CAMPA"" -> not a word? \n""JIAOS"" -> has S -> invalid.\n\nSo ""CHINA"" is a good candidate.\n\nBut note: we also want to test other common letters. In ""CHINA"", we are testing C, H, N, and we already know I and A.\n\nBut we are not testing the position of A very well because we are putting it at the end. However, we know A is not in position 2, and we are testing position 5.\n\nAlternatively, we could test A in position 1. We had ""AXIOM"" as a candidate.\n\nLet me compare:\n- ""AXIOM"": tests A in position 1, and also X, O, M. \n- ""CHINA"": tests A in position 5, and C, H, N.\n\nBoth are valid and avoid R, S, E.\n\nWe also have the option to test A in position 4, but we couldn\'t find a common word. So let\'s not force that.\n\nAnother candidate: ""ABOIL"" -> not common.\n\nOr ""ADMIT"" -> A D M I T -> third is M, not I -> no.\n\nSo between ""AXIOM"" and ""CHINA"", which one uses more common letters? \nCommon letters: T, N, O, L, C, D, U, M, P, H, etc.\n\n""CHINA"" has C, H, N -> N is very common.\n""AXIOM"" has X (rare), O, M.\n\nSo ""CHINA"" might be better because N is more common than X.\n\nBut we also want to test the position of A. Since we know A is in the word but not in position 2, and we have position 1,4,5 as possibilities. \n\nIn ""CHINA"", we are testing A in position 5. If we get feedback that A is not in position 5, then we know it must be in 1 or 4.\n\nSimilarly, in ""AXIOM"", we test A in position 1.\n\nBut note: we are also testing other letters. We might get more information from ""CHINA"" because N is common.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t put A in a fixed position but uses it in a position we haven\'t tested? But we have to put it somewhere.\n\nAnother idea: we can choose a word that has A in a position we haven\'t tested (so not position 2) and also includes other common letters.\n\nBut we have to have I in the third.\n\nLet me think of other words with I in third and A somewhere else.\n\nFor example: ""DAILY"" -> D A I L Y -> third is I? Positions: 1:D, 2:A, 3:I -> but A is in position 2, which we know is not allowed because the feedback said A is not in position 2. So we cannot put A in position 2 again.\n\nSo we must avoid position 2 for A.\n\nTherefore, in ""DAILY"", we are putting A in position 2, which is invalid because we know A is not in position 2. So that guess would be wasting a letter.\n\nSo we must not put A in position 2.\n\nTherefore, for the next guess, we must have:\n- Third letter: I\n- A in position 1, 4, or 5.\n- No R, S, E.\n\nAnd we want to test as many new common letters as possible.\n\nAnother candidate: ""PAINT"" -> P A I N T -> third is I? Positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:I -> but A is in position 2, which is not allowed. So invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""MAINS"" -> has S -> invalid.\n\n""TALIK"" -> not common.\n\n""VALID"" -> has L, I, D. But V A L I D -> third is L, not I -> no.\n\n""OCTIC"" -> not common.\n\n""LIPID"" -> L I P I D -> third is P, not I -> no.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""CHINA"" or ""AXIOM"". \n\nI think ""CHINA"" is a better choice because it has more common letters (C, H, N) and avoids very rare letters like X.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""CHINA"".\n\nBut note: we are also testing the presence of C, H, N. If any of these are in the word, we\'ll get feedback.\n\nAlso, if A is in position 5, we\'ll get a check for A; if not, we\'ll get a minus or an x.\n\nSimilarly, we know I is already correct, so that will be a check.\n\nSo let\'s guess ""CHINA"".\n\nBut wait, what if the word has duplicate letters? We don\'t know, but the feedback will tell us.\n\nSo the next guess: ""CHINA""\n\nWe\'ll get feedback on each letter.\n\nBut note: we are using the letter A again, which we know is in the word, but we are testing its position.\n\nThis is acceptable.\n\nSo I choose ""CHINA"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R, S, and E are not in the secret word (x).\n- A is in the word but not in the second position (-).\n- I is in the word and correctly placed in the third position (✓).\n\nKey deductions:\n- The secret word must have \'I\' in the third position.\n- It contains \'A\' but not in position 1, 2, or 5 (since it was misplaced in position 2, and positions 1 and 5 were not tested yet; it could be in position 4).\n- R, S, and E are eliminated, so the new guess must avoid these letters.\n- The goal is to test \'A\' in a new position (position 1, 4, or 5) while introducing common unused letters (e.g., C, H, N, T, O) to gather more information.\n\nAfter evaluating options:\n- ""CHINA"" fits the criteria: \n  - \'I\' is in the third position.\n  - \'A\' is tested in position 5 (a new position to check).\n  - Avoids R, S, E.\n  - Introduces common letters C, H, and N for additional feedback.\n\nThis guess will help narrow down the position of \'A\' and reveal if any of C, H, or N are in the word.\n\n<guess>CHINA</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(✓) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: CHINA -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) I(✓) N(-) A(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: RAISE\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- I: ✓ (correct position, so the third letter is I)\n- S: x (not in the word)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nGuess 2: CHINA\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- H: x (not in the word)\n- I: ✓ (correct position, third letter is I, which we already knew)\n- N: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- A: - (in the word but wrong position)\n\nFrom this, we know:\n- The secret word has the letter I in the third position: _ _ I _ _\n- The secret word contains A and N, but not in the positions we guessed.\n  - For A: In RAISE, A was in position 2, but it was wrong position. In CHINA, A was in position 5, also wrong position. So A is not in position 2 or 5. Since the word is 5 letters, A must be in position 1 or 4.\n  - For N: In CHINA, N was in position 4, but it was wrong position. So N is in the word but not in position 4. It could be in position 1, 2, or 5 (but note position 3 is I, so not there).\n- Letters not in the word: R, S, E, C, H (from the x\'s).\n\nAlso, we know the word has A and N, and I, and two more letters we haven\'t found yet.\n\nWe need to form a new guess that:\n- Has I in the third position.\n- Includes A and N, but in positions we haven\'t tried for them (for A: not 2 or 5, so must be 1 or 4; for N: not 4, so must be 1, 2, or 5).\n- Avoids the letters R, S, E, C, H.\n\nWe also want to test new common letters to get more information.\n\nPossible positions:\n- A must be in position 1 or 4.\n- N must be in position 1, 2, or 5.\n\nBut note: if A is in position 1, then N cannot be in position 1 (since one letter per position). Similarly, if A is in position 4, then N cannot be in position 4 (which we already know).\n\nWe can consider two cases for A: position 1 or 4.\n\nWe also need to choose a word that is valid and uses common letters.\n\nLet\'s think of words that fit the pattern and constraints.\n\nFirst, if A is in position 1: A _ I _ _\nWe need to place N in one of 2, 4, or 5, but avoiding position 4 for N? No, we only know N is not in position 4 from the previous guess, but in this new word, if we put N in position 4, that would be the same as before? Actually, we know N is not in position 4 of the secret word, so in our guess, if we put N in position 4, it would be wrong, but we are trying to find where N is.\n\nBut we are allowed to put N in any position except we know it\'s not in 4 in the secret word, so in our guess, we can put it in 1,2,5 to test.\n\nSimilarly for A.\n\nBut to maximize information, we should try to put A in a position we haven\'t tested (so either 1 or 4) and N in a position we haven\'t tested (so 1,2,5) but avoiding the known bad positions for the secret.\n\nSince we have two possibilities for A, we can choose one to test.\n\nAlso, we need two more letters for the remaining positions.\n\nLet me list possible words:\n\nOption 1: A in position 1.\nPattern: A _ I _ _\nWe need to fill positions 2,4,5 with letters that are not R,S,E,C,H, and include N in one of 2,4,5.\n\nPossible words:\n- A?I?N: e.g., ""ADMIN"" - but D and M are new, and N in position 5. Also, check if valid: ADMIN is a word. But we have to avoid R,S,E,C,H, which we are. However, in ADMIN, position 4 is I? No: A D M I N -> positions: 1:A, 2:D, 3:M, 4:I, 5:N -> but we need I in position 3, so that would be A D I ...? ADMIN has M in position 3, not I. So no.\n\nWe need the third letter to be I, so pattern: A _ I _ _\n\nSo for example:\n- A N I _ _ -> but N in position 2? Then we have A N I ? ? \n  Words: ""ANVIL"" - A N V I L -> but third letter is V, not I -> no.\n  ""ANIMI"" - not common, and third letter is M? A N I M I -> positions: 1:A, 2:N, 3:I, 4:M, 5:I -> that works. But ""ANIMI"" is plural of animus? Not very common, and we have two I\'s? The secret might have duplicate letters, but we don\'t know.\n\nBut let\'s avoid obscure words.\n\n- A ? I N ? -> with N in position 4? But we know N is not in position 4 in the secret, so if we put N in position 4, it will be wrong, but we can do it to test? Actually, we want to use the guess to find the position, so we should put N in a position that might be correct, i.e., 1,2, or 5.\n\nSo for A in position 1 and N in position 2: A N I ? ? \nWords: ""ANION"" - A N I O N -> but that has two N\'s? And O. Positions: 1:A, 2:N, 3:I, 4:O, 5:N. This is a valid word (an ion is a type of atom). And it avoids R,S,E,C,H.\n\nBut we have N in position 2 and 5. We don\'t know if the secret has duplicate N.\n\nAlternatively, ""ANIMA"" - A N I M A -> but M and A. But A is already in position 1, and we are putting A in position 5? But we know A is not in position 5 from previous feedback (in CHINA, A was in 5 and got - meaning not in 5). So we cannot put A in position 5 again? We can, but it would be a waste because we know it\'s not there. So better to avoid position 5 for A.\n\nSimilarly, for N, we don\'t know about position 5 yet.\n\nBut in ""ANION"", we have A in 1, N in 2 and 5, I in 3, O in 4.\n\nBut we know A is not in 5, so the A in position 5 would be incorrect, but in the secret, if there is no second A, it would be marked x. But we don\'t know if there is a duplicate A.\n\nTo keep it simple, let\'s avoid duplicate letters for now.\n\nAnother word: A ? I ? N with N in position 5: A _ I _ N\nWords: ""AXIIN"" not a word.\n""ALIEN"" but E is not allowed (we know E is not in the word).\n""AVIAN"" - A V I A N -> positions: 1:A, 2:V, 3:I, 4:A, 5:N. This has A in 1 and 4. But we are testing A in position 1, and also position 4? But we know A is in the word, and if it\'s in position 1, then position 4 might be another A or not.\n\nBut ""AVIAN"" is a valid word. And it avoids R,S,E,C,H.\n\nNow, if A is in position 4: pattern: _ _ I A _\nWe need to fill positions 1,2,5 with letters not R,S,E,C,H, and include N in one of 1,2,5.\n\nFor example:\n- N in position 1: N _ I A _\n  Words: ""NOMIA"" - N O M I A -> but third is M, not I -> no.\n  ""NIVAL"" - N I V A L -> third is V, not I -> no.\n  We need third to be I, so: N ? I A ? \n  Words: ""NAIAD"" - N A I A D -> but A is in position 2, which we know is not allowed (A not in position 2 from first guess). So invalid.\n  ""NAIRA"" - N A I R A -> has R, which is not allowed (R is eliminated). Also, A in position 2 again.\n\n- N in position 2: _ N I A _\n  Words: ""UNICA"" - U N I C A -> but C is eliminated -> invalid.\n  ""ONIUM"" - O N I U M -> but U and M. Valid? Onium is a chemistry term. Avoids bad letters. So ""ONIUM"" could work, but it has O, N, I, U, M.\n\n- N in position 5: _ _ I A N\n  Words: ""MAJOR"" but has R and J? Not allowed.\n  ""LABIA"" - L A B I A -> but A in position 2 -> invalid.\n  ""TOLAR"" has R -> invalid.\n  ""KAPUT"" has K and P, U, T -> but no N? We need N in position 5. Pattern: _ _ I A N\n  Words: ""URBAN"" - U R B A N -> has R -> invalid.\n  ""PAGAN"" - P A G A N -> A in position 2 -> invalid.\n\nIt\'s hard to find words for A in position 4.\n\nAnother common word: ""DAILY"" but A in position 2 -> invalid.\n\nSo perhaps A in position 1 is easier.\n\nBack to A in position 1: we have ""AVIAN"" as a candidate: A V I A N\nBut in ""AVIAN"", we have A in position 1 and 4. We know A is not in position 5, but position 4 is possible. Also, N in position 5.\n\nBut we are testing A in position 1 and 4? We don\'t know if there are two A\'s.\n\nAnother candidate: ""ADMIN"" doesn\'t work because of the third letter.\n\nWhat about ""AXION"" - A X I O N -> positions: 1:A, 2:X, 3:I, 4:O, 5:N. This avoids bad letters. And it tests A in 1, N in 5.\n\nSimilarly, ""AVION"" - A V I O N -> same pattern.\n\n""AVION"" is a word? It means aircraft, from French, but in English, it might be accepted.\n\nBut let\'s stick to common words.\n\n""ANVIL"" has I in third? A N V I L -> third is V, not I.\n\n""ALIGN"" - A L I G N -> positions: 1:A, 2:L, 3:I, 4:G, 5:N. This is a good word. Avoids bad letters. Tests A in 1, N in 5.\n\nBut we know from CHINA that N is not in position 4, but in this guess, N is in position 5, which is a new position. Also, A is in position 1.\n\nSo ""ALIGN"" is a valid guess.\n\nSimilarly, ""ALBIN"" is not common.\n\n""APING"" - A P I N G -> but N in position 4? We know N is not in position 4 in the secret, so if we put N in position 4, it will be wrong. But in ""APING"", N is in position 4, which we know is incorrect for the secret. So it would be better to put N in a position that could be correct, like 2 or 5.\n\nIn ""ALIGN"", N is in position 5, which is untested.\n\nAnother word: ""AMINO"" - A M I N O -> positions: 1:A, 2:M, 3:I, 4:N, 5:O. But N is in position 4, which we know is not correct for the secret (from CHINA feedback: N in position 4 got - meaning not in that position). So if we put N in position 4 again, it will be wrong, and we don\'t gain new information about N\'s position. We should avoid that.\n\nSo ""AMINO"" is not good because it puts N in position 4 again.\n\nSimilarly, we should avoid putting A in position 5 because we know it\'s not there.\n\nSo back to ""ALIGN"": A in 1, N in 5, and new letters L and G.\n\nWe also have the option to test A in position 4.\n\nBut let\'s see if we can find a word with A in position 4.\n\nFor example: _ _ I A _ with N in position 1 or 2 or 5.\n\nWith N in position 1: N ? I A ? \nAs before, hard to find. ""NUBIA"" - N U B I A -> third is B, not I -> no.\n\nWith N in position 2: ? N I A ? \n""UNITY"" has T and Y, but no A? Pattern: ? N I A ? \n""UNICA"" has C -> invalid.\n""ONCIA"" - O N C I A -> has C -> invalid.\n""INIAL"" not a word.\n\nWith N in position 5: ? ? I A N\n""MEDIA"" has E -> invalid.\n""LOTIA"" not a word.\n""BATIK"" has B,T,K, but no N? We need N in position 5? Pattern: ? ? I A N, so the fifth letter is N.\nWords: ""URBAN"" has R -> invalid.\n""PAGAN"" has A in position 2 -> invalid.\n""KAPAN"" not common.\n\n""TITAN"" - T I T A N -> but third letter is T, not I -> no.\n\n""MAYAN"" - M A Y A N -> A in position 2 -> invalid.\n\nSo it\'s difficult. Perhaps ""ALIGN"" is a good choice.\n\nAnother idea: we know A must be in 1 or 4, so we can choose a word that tests A in position 1, and N in a new position.\n\n""ALIGN"": A L I G N\n\nThis way:\n- A in position 1: if it\'s correct, we get ✓; if not, then A must be in position 4 (since we know it\'s not in 2 or 5).\n- N in position 5: we haven\'t tested position 5 for N before (we tested position 4 and it was wrong).\n- Also, we test L and G.\n\nIf we get feedback that A is correct in position 1, then great. If not, then we know A is in position 4.\n\nSimilarly for N.\n\nSo I think ""ALIGN"" is a reasonable guess.\n\nBut note: we have to make sure the word is valid. ""ALIGN"" is a valid English word.\n\nAnother common word: ""OPIUM"" - O P I U M -> but no A or N? We must include A and N because they are in the word.\n\nWe must include the known letters: A, I, N. I is fixed, but A and N are in the word and must be included to get their positions.\n\nSo the guess must contain A and N.\n\n""ALIGN"" contains A and N.\n\nSo I\'ll go with that.\n\nBut let\'s see if there\'s a word that tests A in position 4.\n\nFor example, ""DELIA"" has E -> invalid.\n\n""MANIA"" - M A N I A -> A in position 2 -> invalid.\n\n""RADII"" has R -> invalid.\n\nSo ""ALIGN"" seems good.\n\nAnother candidate: ""TAKING"" is 6 letters, no.\n\n""BAYOU"" has no I.\n\nSo <guess>ALIGN</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Analyze Previous Feedback**:\n   - **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: \n     - R (x) → Not in the word.\n     - A (-) → In the word but wrong position (not position 2).\n     - I (✓) → Correct and in position 3.\n     - S (x) → Not in the word.\n     - E (x) → Not in the word.\n   - **Guess 2 (CHINA)**:\n     - C (x) → Not in the word.\n     - H (x) → Not in the word.\n     - I (✓) → Correct and in position 3 (confirmed).\n     - N (-) → In the word but wrong position (not position 4).\n     - A (-) → In the word but wrong position (not position 5).\n\n2. **Key Deductions**:\n   - **Fixed Position**: The third letter is **I** (from both guesses).\n   - **Confirmed Letters in Word**: \n     - **A** is in the word but not in positions 2 or 5 (from RAISE and CHINA feedback).\n     - **N** is in the word but not in position 4 (from CHINA feedback).\n   - **Eliminated Letters**: R, S, E, C, H (all marked ""x"").\n   - **Possible Positions for A and N**:\n     - **A**: Must be in position 1 or 4 (since positions 2 and 5 are invalid).\n     - **N**: Must be in position 1, 2, or 5 (since position 4 is invalid, and position 3 is occupied by I).\n   - **Unknown Letters**: Two additional letters are needed (positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 are open, but A and N will occupy two of these). The word has exactly 5 distinct letters or duplicates?

- A: - → in the word but wrong position (not position 5)

Guess 3: ALIGN
- A: ✓ → correct and in position 1
- L: x → not in the word
- I: ✓ → correct and in position 3
- G: x → not in the word
- N: ✓ → correct and in position 5

Now we know:
- Position 1: A (from ALIGN feedback: A(✓))
- Position 3: I (already known)
- Position 5: N (from ALIGN feedback: N(✓))
- A is confirmed in position 1, so we no longer need to consider A in other positions.
- N is confirmed in position 5, so we no longer need to consider N in other positions.

Eliminated letters (marked x in any guess): R, S, E, C, H, L, G (from guesses above: R,S,E,C,H,L,G are all not in the word).

Known letters in the word: A, I, N, and we have two positions left: position 2 and position 4.

We need to find letters for position 2 and 4 that are in the word, avoiding eliminated letters.

Also, from Guess 2, we had N as (-) in position 4, but now we know N is actually in position 5, so that fits.

Now the secret word is: A ? I ? N

We need to fill position 2 and 4.

We also have the constraint that from Guess 1, A was misplaced (not in position 2), but now A is in position 1, so that's fine.

Since we have no other known letters, we must choose a word that fits the pattern A ? I ? N, using letters not eliminated and not using known positions incorrectly.

Eliminated letters: R, S, E, C, H, L, G.

The word must be a valid English word.

Possible letters for position 2 and 4: any letter not in the eliminated set and not conflicting.

Common letters available: B, D, F, K, M, O, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, etc.

We need to form words of the form A?I?N.

We can look for words that match A _ I _ N.

Examples:
- ""AXION"": A X I O N → but ""AXION"" uses O and X. Let's check if O and X are available → not eliminated. However, in the pattern, position 4 would be O? But we have position 2: X, position 4: O.
- ""AVIAN"": A V I A N → but ""AVIAN"" has A in position 4, but we know position 1 is A and position 5 is N, so ""AVIAN"" would have A in position 4, which would be a duplicate? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, in Guess 3, ""ALIGN"" had A only in position 1, and L and G eliminated. But ""AVIAN"" might work if the secret word has two A's? But in the feedback from Guess 1, when we guessed ""RAISE"", A was in position 2 and marked as -, which means A is in the word but not position 2. It doesn't say if there is only one A. Similarly, in Guess 3, we have A only in position 1.

But in ""AVIAN"", position 4 is A. We don't know if the word has two A's.

But we can try ""AVIAN"", but note that position 4 must be filled, and in ""AVIAN"" it's A.

But our pattern: A ? I ? N, so the fourth letter must be whatever we put.

Another common word: ""ADMIN"" - A D M I N → but in this, the third position is M? No: positions: 1:A, 2:D, 3:M? We need position 3 to be I, but in ""ADMIN"" it's M. So no.

We need position 3 to be I: so it's fixed.

Words: A ? I ? N with ? being any letter except eliminated ones.

List of possible words:
- ""AXION"": A X I O N
- ""AVION"": similar, A V I O N (meaning aircraft)
- ""ANIMa"" but not 5 letters.
- ""ATOLL"" doesn't fit.

Another: ""AUDIO"" has 5 letters but no N? We need N in position 5.

Pattern must end with N: A _ I _ N.

So:
- Option: ""AXION""
- ""ABIEN"" not a word.
- ""AKIEN"" not a word.
- ""AMIGN"" not a word.

Known words: ""AXITE"" has E, not allowed.
""AMINO"" has O? A M I N O → positions: 1:A,2:M,3:I,4:N,5:O → but we have N in position 4? But we know position 5 must be N from feedback? No, position 5 is N? In ""AMINO"", position 5 is O, not N. So it doesn't match.

Our pattern requires position 5 to be N.

So: A _ I _ N

""AXION"": A X I O N → position 4 is O.
""ARIES"" has R and S → eliminated.
""ASHEN"" has S, H, E → eliminated.
""AWFUL"" no I.

""AVION"": A V I O N → position 4 is O.

But is ""AVION"" an accepted word? It might be less common.

""AEION"" not a word.

""BEGIN"" has G → eliminated.

""ODIUM"" doesn't fit.

""BAZIN"" not common.

Another word: ""ATOLL"" has O and L → L eliminated? Yes, L is eliminated from Guess 3.

L is out, so cannot use L.

Similarly, G is out.

Now, another possibility: ""APHID"" → A P H I D → but H is eliminated? Yes, H is in Guess 2 marked x.

Cannot use H.

""TASTY"" has T, but no I in third? Position 3 should be I? A T I? but last letter not N.

Back to our pattern: position 4 must be a letter, and position 2 another.

Given that, common words:
- ""AXION"": A X I O N
- ""AVIAN"": A V I A N → but position 4 is A → duplicate A? Possible, but let's see if there might be other words.

Also, ""IRISH"" doesn't start with A.

Is there ""AMIGN""? No.

Perhaps ""ABRIN"" → A B R I N → has R → eliminated.

""ACTIN"" → A C T I N → C eliminated.

""ADZIN"" → A D Z I N → D and Z. Valid? Adzin is not common.

""ALBIN"" → has L → eliminated.

""ASPIC"" has S and P → S eliminated, etc.

So ""AXION"" or ""AVION"" seem plausible.

But there's another: ""AMINO"" doesn't match because last letter is O, not N.

Wait, what about ""AMNIA""? A M N I A → but position 3 is N? We need I in position 3. So: A M N I A → positions: 1:A, 2:M, 3:N, 4:I, 5:A → not I in third.

Another word: ""ANVIL"" has V and L → L eliminated.

Perhaps ""OCEAN"" doesn't fit.

I think ""AXION"" is the most common.

But let's confirm with dictionary: Axion is a physics term, but in word games, it might be accepted.

Another word: ""OVINE"" doesn't fit.

Perhaps ""AURIC"" has R, C.

So if we try ""AXION"", it has X and O.

We haven't used X or O yet, and they are not eliminated.

In ALIGN, we only have A, L, I, G, N → L and G eliminated.

So X and O are not restricted.

Similarly, V is available? Yes, from earlier.

But ""AVION"" with V and O: V is not eliminated? Eliminated letters: R,S,E,C,H,L,G. So V is available.

Similarly, O is available.

Another possibility: ""AVID"" not 5 letters.

Perhaps ""BAUIN"" not a word.

So ""AXION"" or ""AVION"". While ""AVIAN"" is a word but it has A in position 4, which might be duplicate.

In ""AVIAN"": A V I A N → we have two A's.

But in the feedback so far, we don't have evidence against duplicate A's.

For example, in Guess 1, A was in position 2 and got -, which doesn't preclude another A.

But in Guess 3, ""ALIGN"" had only one A, and it was in position 1 with a check. If there were a second A, it might not be in the feedback because we didn't guess it.

Similarly, the known letters: we have A, I, N, and two more letters. One of them could be A again? Maybe, but let's see.

But in the word A _ I _ N, if position 4 is A, then the word would have A in both position 1 and 4.

Possible? Yes, words like ""AVIAN"".

Similarly, ""AZIDE""? but not commonly known.

So two candidates: ""AVIAN"" and ""AXION"".

We need to choose one.

Since in Guess 2, we have A with (-) in position 5, and now we have position 1 A, position 5 N, so if position 4 were A, it would work.

Also, ""AVIAN"" uses V and A, which are not eliminated.

Similarly, ""AXION"" uses X and O.

But V is more common than X? Not necessarily.

But to decide, we can see which one gives more information or is more likely.

Since we have only two positions left, we can guess one.

If we guess ""AVIAN"":
- Positions: A(1), V(2), I(3), A(4), N(5)
- We will get feedback on V and A.

But if V is not in the word, we get x for V and for the second A? Position 4: if it's A, and if the secret has only one A, but we put two, it might cause issues? Feedback doesn't account for duplicates well? No, the feedback should handle it: each instance is marked separately.

For example, if the secret has one A, and we put A in position 4 where it is not, it will be marked x if not present.

But in ""AVIAN"", we have A in position 1: if secret has A in 1, it's good; A in position 4: if secret has A elsewhere, it might be wrong or misplaced.

Similarly for ""AXION"".

But let's look at the feedback from ALIGN: we have A(✓), L(x), I(✓), G(x), N(✓). So the secret word must have A, I, N, and two other letters that are not L or G, and not the eliminated ones.

If we guess ""AVIAN"", it uses V and A (again). So it tests V and the possibility of another A.

If we guess and the secret is ""AVIAN"", we win.

If not, we get information.

Similarly for ""AXION"".

But note there is another possibility: what if position 4 is not A or O, but something else? For example, could it be T? But what word? ""ATONE"" has E and no I.

""AUTOS"" has U,T,O,S → S eliminated.

Actually, letters available: B,D,F,K,M,O,P,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

And words: A?I?N

- With B: ""ABRIN"" has R → invalid.
- With D: ""ADMIN"" wrong → but position 3 not I? A D ? I N? A D I ? N → ""ADMIN"" becomes bad because of the third letter. A D M I N → third letter is M.
  ""IODIN"" doesn't start with A.
- With F: ""AFRIT"" has R → no.
- With K: ""AKIN"" too short.
- With M: ""AMNIA"" not correct pattern? A M N I A → positions not fitting, third is N.
- With O: see ""AXION"" or ""AVION""
- With P: ""APING"" has G → eliminated? G is eliminated from Guess 3, G(x). So G is out.
- With T: ""ATRIP"" has R → no.
- With U: ""AURIC"" has R,C → no.
- With V: ""AVIAN"" or ""AVION"" without the O? ""AVION"" requires O at position 4.
  ""AVIAN"" uses A again.
- With W: ""AWING"" has G → eliminated.
- With X: ""AXION"" uses O.
- With Y: ""AYSIN"" not a word.
- With Z: ""AZIDE"" → A Z I D E → E is eliminated? E is in Guess 1, E(x), so not allowed.

So actually, the most plausible words are:
- ""AVIAN"" → A V I A N
- ""AXION"" → A X I O N
- ""AVION"" → A V I O N (if accepted)

""AVIAN"" is more common. Also, since position 4 is A, it might be.

But let's notice that in Guess 1, we had A in position 2, which was -, so A is not position 2. But position 4 was not tested. Position 5 was tested in Guess 2 and got - for A, meaning A is not position 5. Position 1 and 4 are possible, and we now know position 1 is A, so position 4 could be A? Or something else.

In Guess 3, we tested position 4 with G, but got G(x), meaning it's not G.

Now, if the secret has duplicate A, it's possible.

We can choose ""AVIAN"" to test that.

But if we choose ""AVIAN"", and if the secret is not ""AVIAN"", we might get:

- Position 1: A ✓
- Position 2: V ? → if not in word, x; if in word, -
- Position 3: I ✓
- Position 4: A → if the secret has an A here, then ✓ or -? If the secret has A already in position 1, and no second A, then position 4 would be x. But if the secret has two A's, and one is in position 4, then ✓ or -? Actually, if position 4 has A and it is correct for that position, ✓; if misplaced, -; but since we already have A in position 1, it depends on how many A's are in the secret.

But it could be messy.

Similarly, ""AXION"" would be cleaner: A X I O N → all letters distinct.

So I think ""AXION"" is a safe guess.

Also, ""AXION"" is a valid word in some dictionaries.

But let's see if there is a better word.

Another word: ""OLEIN"" doesn't start with A.

I think we should guess ""AXION"" or ""AVION"".

To be common, ""AVIAN"" is more frequent.

We have only two possibilities essentially: the secret is either ""AVIAN"", ""AXION"", or ""AVION"", or perhaps another rare word? But I think ""AVIAN"" is likely.

Perhaps ""AITUN"" not a word.

But note, we have positions 2 and 4 to fill.

From Guess 2, we had N in position 4 which was -, but now N is in position 5.

No other information about position 4.

Let's list: from Guess 3, position 4 is G, which was not in the word.

Similarly, Guess 2, position 4 was N, which was in the word but not there.

But no direct feedback for other letters at position 4.

We are free to guess any letter.

But ""AVIAN"" is A in position 4, which we don't know if it is in the word again.

Unless we have evidence from the first guess? We only knew one A.

But in word games, duplicates happen.

Perhaps we should guess a word that has different letters to maximize info.

Since we know three letters, and only position 2 and 4 unknown, we can guess a word that tests two new letters.

Let me choose ""AXION"": A X I O N

It uses X and O, new letters.

If we get feedback that X or O is in the word or not, we win.

Similarly, for ""AVIAN"": V and A again.

But since A is known, if we put it in position 4, if it's correct, we get ✓ for A; if not, we get x or -.

But if we get a ✓ for A in position 4, that means there is a second A at position 4.

If we get x or -, then no second A.

So equally good.

But let's be systematic: the secret word is A ? I ? N

Letters in the word: A, I, N, and two others (say, L1 for position 2, L2 for position 4).

L1 and L2 are from the set of allowed letters minus the eliminated ones.

Eliminated: R,S,E,C,H,L,G.

Previously, in Guess 1 and 2, we had no information on position 4 except that when N was there, it was wrong.

But we can guess ""AXION"".

I think ""AVIAN"" is a common word meaning related to birds, like avian influenza.

Similarly, ""AXION"" is less common.

But in Wordle, it might be accepted.

But to be safe, let's guess ""AVIAN"".

If it's not, we still have guesses left.

We have used 3 guesses, so we have 3 left.

But let's aim for the most likely.

Another common word: ""AMNIA"" but doesn't fit pattern.

Or ""ANIMA"" has A at the end, but pattern is A _ I _ N, so ""ANIMA"" is A N I M A → position 5 is A, but we need N at position 5.

No.

I think ""AVIAN"" is our best bet.

So I'll guess ""AVIAN"".
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (RAISE)**:
     - R(x), S(x), E(x) → R, S, E not in the word.
     - A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 2.
     - I(✓) → I is fixed in position 3.
   - **Guess-2 (CHINA)**:
     - C(x), H(x) → C and H not in the word.
     - I(✓) → Confirms I in position 3.
     - N(-) → N is in the word but not in position 4.
     - A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 5.
   - **Guess 3 (ALIGN)**:
     - A(✓) → A is fixed in position 1.
     - L(x) → L not in the word.
     - I(✓) → Confirms I in position 3.
     - G(x) → G not in the word.
     - N(✓) → N is fixed in position 5.

2. **Key Deductions**:
   - **Fixed Positions**:
     - Position 1: A
     - Position 3: I
     - Position 5: N
     - The secret word pattern is A _ I _ N.
   - **Eliminated Letters**: R, S, E, C, H, L, G (all marked ""x"" in previous guesses).
   - **Confirmed Letters in Word**: A, I, N are in the word, but no duplicates revealed yet.
   - **Unknown Positions**: Positions 2 and 4 need letters from the remaining pool (not eliminated).
   - **Possible Letters for Positions 2 and 4**: Any English letter except eliminated ones (available letters include B, D, F, K, M, O, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).
   - **Previous Constraints**:
     - A cannot be in positions 2 or 5 (from Guess 1 and Guess 2), but this is resolved as A is now fixed in position 1.
     - N cannot be in position 4 (from Guess 2), but this does not affect position 4 directly.

3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:
   - Test the most common word fitting the pattern A _ I _ N using possible letters.
   - Prioritize words with high-frequency letters to maximize information if wrong.
   - ""AVIAN"" fits:
     - Pattern: A (position 1), V (position 2), I (position 3), A (position 4), N (position 5).
     - Why ""AVIAN""? 
       - Checks for a potential duplicate A in position 4 (viable since previous feedback doesn't prohibit it).
       - Introduces V (a common unused consonant) for position 2.
       - Avoids eliminated letters.
       - Valid English word (meaning: related to birds).
   - If ""AVIAN"" is correct, the game ends. If wrong:
     - Feedback will confirm if V is in the word (and its position).
     - Feedback on position 4 (A) will reveal whether there is a second A.
     - This reduces possibilities for position 4 significantly.

4. **Alternative Options**:
   - ""AXION"" (a physics term) was considered but is less common. 
   - Other words like ""AVION"" (aircraft) or ""ABRIN"" (toxic protein) were rejected due to rarity, eliminated letters (e.g., R in ""ABRIN""), or not fitting the pattern.
   - ""AVIAN"" is optimal: It tests the duplicate-A possibility cleanly and uses a high-frequency letter (V).

5. **Expected Feedback**:
   - If secret word is ""AVIAN"":
     - A(✓), V(✓), I(✓), A(✓), N(✓).
   - If not:
     - V may get (-) or (x), confirming if V is in the word.
     - Position 4 A may get (x) if no duplicate A, or (-) if A is elsewhere (but position 1 is fixed, so this would be unlikely).

Given the above, ""AVIAN"" is the best guess.

<guess>AVIAN</guess>",AVIAN,"We are given feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE
- R: x → not in the word
- A: - → in the word but wrong position (not position 2)
- I: ✓ → correct and in position 3
- S: x → not in the word
- E: x → not in the word

Guess 2: CHINA
- C: x → not in the word
- H: x → not in the word
- I: ✓ → correct and in position 3
- N: - → in the word but wrong position (not position 4)
- A: - → in the word but wrong position (not position 5)

Guess 3: ALIGN
- A: ✓ → correct and in position 1
- L: x → not in the word
- I: ✓ → correct and in position 3
- G: x → not in the word
- N: ✓ → correct and in position 5

Now we know:
- Position 1: A (from ALIGN feedback: A(✓))
- Position 3: I (already known)
- Position 5: N (from ALIGN feedback: N(✓))
- A is confirmed in position 1, so we no longer need to consider A in other positions.
- N is confirmed in position 5, so we no longer need to consider N in other positions.

Eliminated letters (marked x in any guess): R, S, E, C, H, L, G (from guesses above: R,S,E,C,H,L,G are all not in the word).

Known letters in the word: A, I, N, and we have two positions left: position 2 and position 4.

We need to find letters for position 2 and 4 that are in the word, avoiding eliminated letters.

Also, from Guess 2, we had N as (-) in position 4, but now we know N is actually in position 5, so that fits.

Now the secret word is: A ? I ? N

We need to fill position 2 and 4.

We also have the constraint that from Guess 1, A was misplaced (not in position 2), but now A is in position 1, so that's fine.

Since we have no other known letters, we must choose a word that fits the pattern A ? I ? N, using letters not eliminated and not using known positions incorrectly.

Eliminated letters: R, S, E, C, H, L, G.

The word must be a valid English word.

Possible letters for position 2 and 4: any letter not in the eliminated set and not conflicting.

Common letters available: B, D, F, K, M, O, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, etc.

We need to form words of the form A?I?N.

We can look for words that match A _ I _ N.

Examples:
- ""AXION"": A X I O N → but ""AXION"" uses O and X. Let's check if O and X are available → not eliminated. However, in the pattern, position 4 would be O? But we have position 2: X, position 4: O.
- ""AVIAN"": A V I A N → but ""AVIAN"" has A in position 4, but we know position 1 is A and position 5 is N, so ""AVIAN"" would have A in position 4, which would be a duplicate? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, in Guess 3, ""ALIGN"" had A only in position 1, and L and G eliminated. But ""AVIAN"" might work if the secret word has two A's? But in the feedback from Guess 1, when we guessed ""RAISE"", A was in position 2 and marked as -, which means A is in the word but not position 2. It doesn't say if there is only one A. Similarly, in Guess 3, we have A only in position 1.

But in ""AVIAN"", position 4 is A. We don't know if the word has two A's.

But we can try ""AVIAN"", but note that position 4 must be filled, and in ""AVIAN"" it's A.

But our pattern: A ? I ? N, so the fourth letter must be whatever we put.

Another common word: ""ADMIN"" - A D M I N → but in this, the third position is M? No: positions: 1:A, 2:D, 3:M? We need position 3 to be I, but in ""ADMIN"" it's M. So no.

We need position 3 to be I: so it's fixed.

Words: A ? I ? N with ? being any letter except eliminated ones.

List of possible words:
- ""AXION"": A X I O N
- ""AVION"": similar, A V I O N (meaning aircraft)
- ""ANIMa"" but not 5 letters.
- ""ATOLL"" doesn't fit.

Another: ""AUDIO"" has 5 letters but no N? We need N in position 5.

Pattern must end with N: A _ I _ N.

So:
- Option: ""AXION""
- ""ABIEN"" not a word.
- ""AKIEN"" not a word.
- ""AMIGN"" not a word.

Known words: ""AXITE"" has E, not allowed.
""AMINO"" has O? A M I N O → positions: 1:A,2:M,3:I,4:N,5:O → but we have N in position 4? But we know position 5 must be N from feedback? No, position 5 is N? In ""AMINO"", position 5 is O, not N. So it doesn't match.

Our pattern requires position 5 to be N.

So: A _ I _ N

""AXION"": A X I O N → position 4 is O.
""ARIES"" has R and S → eliminated.
""ASHEN"" has S, H, E → eliminated.
""AWFUL"" no I.

""AVION"": A V I O N → position 4 is O.

But is ""AVION"" an accepted word? It might be less common.

""AEION"" not a word.

""BEGIN"" has G → eliminated.

""ODIUM"" doesn't fit.

""BAZIN"" not common.

Another word: ""ATOLL"" has O and L → L eliminated? Yes, L is eliminated from Guess 3.

L is out, so cannot use L.

Similarly, G is out.

Now, another possibility: ""APHID"" → A P H I D → but H is eliminated? Yes, H is in Guess 2 marked x.

Cannot use H.

""TASTY"" has T, but no I in third? Position 3 should be I? A T I? but last letter not N.

Back to our pattern: position 4 must be a letter, and position 2 another.

Given that, common words:
- ""AXION"": A X I O N
- ""AVIAN"": A V I A N → but position 4 is A → duplicate A? Possible, but let's see if there might be other words.

Also, ""IRISH"" doesn't start with A.

Is there ""AMIGN""? No.

Perhaps ""ABRIN"" → A B R I N → has R → eliminated.

""ACTIN"" → A C T I N → C eliminated.

""ADZIN"" → A D Z I N → D and Z. Valid? Adzin is not common.

""ALBIN"" → has L → eliminated.

""ASPIC"" has S and P → S eliminated, etc.

So ""AXION"" or ""AVION"" seem plausible.

But there's another: ""AMINO"" doesn't match because last letter is O, not N.

Wait, what about ""AMNIA""? A M N I A → but position 3 is N? We need I in position 3. So: A M N I A → positions: 1:A, 2:M, 3:N, 4:I, 5:A → not I in third.

Another word: ""ANVIL"" has V and L → L eliminated.

Perhaps ""OCEAN"" doesn't fit.

I think ""AXION"" is the most common.

But let's confirm with dictionary: Axion is a physics term, but in word games, it might be accepted.

Another word: ""OVINE"" doesn't fit.

Perhaps ""AURIC"" has R, C.

So if we try ""AXION"", it has X and O.

We haven't used X or O yet, and they are not eliminated.

In ALIGN, we only have A, L, I, G, N → L and G eliminated.

So X and O are not restricted.

Similarly, V is available? Yes, from earlier.

But ""AVION"" with V and O: V is not eliminated? Eliminated letters: R,S,E,C,H,L,G. So V is available.

Similarly, O is available.

Another possibility: ""AVID"" not 5 letters.

Perhaps ""BAUIN"" not a word.

So ""AXION"" or ""AVION"". While ""AVIAN"" is a word but it has A in position 4, which might be duplicate.

In ""AVIAN"": A V I A N → we have two A's.

But in the feedback so far, we don't have evidence against duplicate A's.

For example, in Guess 1, A was in position 2 and got -, which doesn't preclude another A.

But in Guess 3, ""ALIGN"" had only one A, and it was in position 1 with a check. If there were a second A, it might not be in the feedback because we didn't guess it.

Similarly, the known letters: we have A, I, N, and two more letters. One of them could be A again? Maybe, but let's see.

But in the word A _ I _ N, if position 4 is A, then the word would have A in both position 1 and 4.

Possible? Yes, words like ""AVIAN"".

Similarly, ""AZIDE""? but not commonly known.

So two candidates: ""AVIAN"" and ""AXION"".

We need to choose one.

Since in Guess 2, we have A with (-) in position 5, and now we have position 1 A, position 5 N, so if position 4 were A, it would work.

Also, ""AVIAN"" uses V and A, which are not eliminated.

Similarly, ""AXION"" uses X and O.

But V is more common than X? Not necessarily.

But to decide, we can see which one gives more information or is more likely.

Since we have only two positions left, we can guess one.

If we guess ""AVIAN"":
- Positions: A(1), V(2), I(3), A(4), N(5)
- We will get feedback on V and A.

But if V is not in the word, we get x for V and for the second A? Position 4: if it's A, and if the secret has only one A, but we put two, it might cause issues? Feedback doesn't account for duplicates well? No, the feedback should handle it: each instance is marked separately.

For example, if the secret has one A, and we put A in position 4 where it is not, it will be marked x if not present.

But in ""AVIAN"", we have A in position 1: if secret has A in 1, it's good; A in position 4: if secret has A elsewhere, it might be wrong or misplaced.

Similarly for ""AXION"".

But let's look at the feedback from ALIGN: we have A(✓), L(x), I(✓), G(x), N(✓). So the secret word must have A, I, N, and two other letters that are not L or G, and not the eliminated ones.

If we guess ""AVIAN"", it uses V and A (again). So it tests V and the possibility of another A.

If we guess and the secret is ""AVIAN"", we win.

If not, we get information.

Similarly for ""AXION"".

But note there is another possibility: what if position 4 is not A or O, but something else? For example, could it be T? But what word? ""ATONE"" has E and no I.

""AUTOS"" has U,T,O,S → S eliminated.

Actually, letters available: B,D,F,K,M,O,P,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

And words: A?I?N

- With B: ""ABRIN"" has R → invalid.
- With D: ""ADMIN"" wrong → but position 3 not I? A D ? I N? A D I ? N → ""ADMIN"" becomes bad because of the third letter. A D M I N → third letter is M.
  ""IODIN"" doesn't start with A.
- With F: ""AFRIT"" has R → no.
- With K: ""AKIN"" too short.
- With M: ""AMNIA"" not correct pattern? A M N I A → positions not fitting, third is N.
- With O: see ""AXION"" or ""AVION""
- With P: ""APING"" has G → eliminated? G is eliminated from Guess 3, G(x). So G is out.
- With T: ""ATRIP"" has R → no.
- With U: ""AURIC"" has R,C → no.
- With V: ""AVIAN"" or ""AVION"" without the O? ""AVION"" requires O at position 4.
  ""AVIAN"" uses A again.
- With W: ""AWING"" has G → eliminated.
- With X: ""AXION"" uses O.
- With Y: ""AYSIN"" not a word.
- With Z: ""AZIDE"" → A Z I D E → E is eliminated? E is in Guess 1, E(x), so not allowed.

So actually, the most plausible words are:
- ""AVIAN"" → A V I A N
- ""AXION"" → A X I O N
- ""AVION"" → A V I O N (if accepted)

""AVIAN"" is more common. Also, since position 4 is A, it might be.

But let's notice that in Guess 1, we had A in position 2, which was -, so A is not position 2. But position 4 was not tested. Position 5 was tested in Guess 2 and got - for A, meaning A is not position 5. Position 1 and 4 are possible, and we now know position 1 is A, so position 4 could be A? Or something else.

In Guess 3, we tested position 4 with G, but got G(x), meaning it's not G.

Now, if the secret has duplicate A, it's possible.

We can choose ""AVIAN"" to test that.

But if we choose ""AVIAN"", and if the secret is not ""AVIAN"", we might get:

- Position 1: A ✓
- Position 2: V ? → if not in word, x; if in word, -
- Position 3: I ✓
- Position 4: A → if the secret has an A here, then ✓ or -? If the secret has A already in position 1, and no second A, then position 4 would be x. But if the secret has two A's, and one is in position 4, then ✓ or -? Actually, if position 4 has A and it is correct for that position, ✓; if misplaced, -; but since we already have A in position 1, it depends on how many A's are in the secret.

But it could be messy.

Similarly, ""AXION"" would be cleaner: A X I O N → all letters distinct.

So I think ""AXION"" is a safe guess.

Also, ""AXION"" is a valid word in some dictionaries.

But let's see if there is a better word.

Another word: ""OLEIN"" doesn't start with A.

I think we should guess ""AXION"" or ""AVION"".

To be common, ""AVIAN"" is more frequent.

We have only two possibilities essentially: the secret is either ""AVIAN"", ""AXION"", or ""AVION"", or perhaps another rare word? But I think ""AVIAN"" is likely.

Perhaps ""AITUN"" not a word.

But note, we have positions 2 and 4 to fill.

From Guess 2, we had N in position 4 which was -, but now N is in position 5.

No other information about position 4.

Let's list: from Guess 3, position 4 is G, which was not in the word.

Similarly, Guess 2, position 4 was N, which was in the word but not there.

But no direct feedback for other letters at position 4.

We are free to guess any letter.

But ""AVIAN"" is A in position 4, which we don't know if it is in the word again.

Unless we have evidence from the first guess? We only knew one A.

But in word games, duplicates happen.

Perhaps we should guess a word that has different letters to maximize info.

Since we know three letters, and only position 2 and 4 unknown, we can guess a word that tests two new letters.

Let me choose ""AXION"": A X I O N

It uses X and O, new letters.

If we get feedback that X or O is in the word or not, we win.

Similarly, for ""AVIAN"": V and A again.

But since A is known, if we put it in position 4, if it's correct, we get ✓ for A; if not, we get x or -.

But if we get a ✓ for A in position 4, that means there is a second A at position 4.

If we get x or -, then no second A.

So equally good.

But let's be systematic: the secret word is A ? I ? N

Letters in the word: A, I, N, and two others (say, L1 for position 2, L2 for position 4).

L1 and L2 are from the set of allowed letters minus the eliminated ones.

Eliminated: R,S,E,C,H,L,G.

Previously, in Guess 1 and 2, we had no information on position 4 except that when N was there, it was wrong.

But we can guess ""AXION"".

I think ""AVIAN"" is a common word meaning related to birds, like avian influenza.

Similarly, ""AXION"" is less common.

But in Wordle, it might be accepted.

But to be safe, let's guess ""AVIAN"".

If it's not, we still have guesses left.

We have used 3 guesses, so we have 3 left.

But let's aim for the most likely.

Another common word: ""AMNIA"" but doesn't fit pattern.

Or ""ANIMA"" has A at the end, but pattern is A _ I _ N, so ""ANIMA"" is A N I M A → position 5 is A, but we need N at position 5.

No.

I think ""AVIAN"" is our best bet.

So I'll guess ""AVIAN"".### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Analyze Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (RAISE)**:
     - R(x), S(x), E(x) → R, S, E not in the word.
     - A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 2.
     - I(✓) → I is fixed in position 3.
   - **Guess-2 (CHINA)**:
     - C(x), H(x) → C and H not in the word.
     - I(✓) → Confirms I in position 3.
     - N(-) → N is in the word but not in position 4.
     - A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 5.
   - **Guess 3 (ALIGN)**:
     - A(✓) → A is fixed in position 1.
     - L(x) → L not in the word.
     - I(✓) → Confirms I in position 3.
     - G(x) → G not in the word.
     - N(✓) → N is fixed in position 5.

2. **Key Deductions**:
   - **Fixed Positions**:
     - Position 1: A
     - Position 3: I
     - Position 5: N
     - The secret word pattern is A _ I _ N.
   - **Eliminated Letters**: R, S, E, C, H, L, G (all marked ""x"" in previous guesses).
   - **Confirmed Letters in Word**: A, I, N are in the word, but no duplicates revealed yet.
   - **Unknown Positions**: Positions 2 and 4 need letters from the remaining pool (not eliminated).
   - **Possible Letters for Positions 2 and 4**: Any English letter except eliminated ones (available letters include B, D, F, K, M, O, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).
   - **Previous Constraints**:
     - A cannot be in positions 2 or 5 (from Guess 1 and Guess 2), but this is resolved as A is now fixed in position 1.
     - N cannot be in position 4 (from Guess 2), but this does not affect position 4 directly.

3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:
   - Test the most common word fitting the pattern A _ I _ N using possible letters.
   - Prioritize words with high-frequency letters to maximize information if wrong.
   - ""AVIAN"" fits:
     - Pattern: A (position 1), V (position 2), I (position 3), A (position 4), N (position 5).
     - Why ""AVIAN""? 
       - Checks for a potential duplicate A in position 4 (viable since previous feedback doesn't prohibit it).
       - Introduces V (a common unused consonant) for position 2.
       - Avoids eliminated letters.
       - Valid English word (meaning: related to birds).
   - If ""AVIAN"" is correct, the game ends. If wrong:
     - Feedback will confirm if V is in the word (and its position).
     - Feedback on position 4 (A) will reveal whether there is a second A.
     - This reduces possibilities for position 4 significantly.

4. **Alternative Options**:
   - ""AXION"" (a physics term) was considered but is less common. 
   - Other words like ""AVION"" (aircraft) or ""ABRIN"" (toxic protein) were rejected due to rarity, eliminated letters (e.g., R in ""ABRIN""), or not fitting the pattern.
   - ""AVIAN"" is optimal: It tests the duplicate-A possibility cleanly and uses a high-frequency letter (V).

5. **Expected Feedback**:
   - If secret word is ""AVIAN"":
     - A(✓), V(✓), I(✓), A(✓), N(✓).
   - If not:
     - V may get (-) or (x), confirming if V is in the word.
     - Position 4 A may get (x) if no duplicate A, or (-) if A is elsewhere (but position 1 is fixed, so this would be unlikely).

Given the above, ""AVIAN"" is the best guess.",Guess 4: AVIAN -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) V(✓) I(✓) A(✓) N(✓),SUCCESS
