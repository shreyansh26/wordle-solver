We are given feedback on our first guess: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
 Interpretation:
 - A is in the word but in the wrong position (since it's marked with '-')
 - C, R, N, E are not in the word at all (marked with 'x')

 Therefore, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letter 'A', but not at the third position (because in ""crane"", A is the third letter).
 - The letters C, R, N, E are absent from the secret word.

 Since R is absent, note that in our guess ""crane"", R was the second letter. So we can eliminate R.

 Now, for the next guess:
 - We must include the letter 'A', but not in the third position.
 - We must avoid using C, R, N, E.

 We also want to try new common letters and positions.

 Our first guess used: C, R, A, N, E. So we avoid those except we know A must be present.

 Let's think of a word that includes 'A' (not in the third position) and uses other common consonants and vowels.

 Available vowels: We only know A is in the word, but there might be others. We haven't tried O, I, U (but note E is out).
 Consonants: We avoid C, R, N, E (E is a vowel, so consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z).

 Since we only have one yellow (A) and four grays, we need to test new letters.

 A good strategy is to use another common word that has A and other common letters we haven't tried.

 Possibilities: 
 - We might try words starting with A? But note A cannot be in the third position, but that doesn't restrict starting with A (position 1) or having it at other positions.

 Example words: 
   ""PLAIT"" - but note we don't know if P, L, I, T are in the word.
   ""SALAD"" - but that has two A's? We don't know if the word has repeated letters. Also, we have only one A confirmed so far.

 However, let's avoid words with the letters we know are absent: C, R, N, E.

 Another idea: ""TASKS"" - but note we don't know about S and K. Also, we haven't tried S and T which are common.

 But note: our feedback for ""crane"" showed that A is not in the third position. So we can try putting A in a different position.

 Let me list positions: 
 Position 1: not A? (we don't know yet)
 Position 2: not A? 
 Position 3: we know it's not A (from the feedback: A was in position 3 and was yellow, meaning it doesn't belong there).
 Position 4: could be A?
 Position 5: could be A?

 So A must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 We can try a word where A is in position 1? Or position 2? Or 4? Or 5?

 Since we don't have much information, we can choose a word that includes A and other common letters.

 Consider words like ""SLATE"": but note E is absent (gray) so we must not use E. And S, L, T are new.

 Alternatively, ""TRACE"" is not possible because it has C (absent) and E (absent).

 Let's avoid E: we know E is absent.

 Possibilities: 
   ""PASTA"" -> contains A twice, which might be inefficient? But let's see: P, A, S, T, A. Also, note that we can test P, S, T. However, we don't know if A appears twice? But feedback might tell us.

 But note: We have only one A confirmed so far. The word might have only one A. So a word with two A's is okay because it tests the presence of A twice? Actually, we don't know. The feedback for A would show for both? Only if the secret word has two A's.

 However, to maximize information, we should prefer distinct letters.

 Since we are avoiding C, R, N, E, I think ""PASTA"" is acceptable? But let me think of words with distinct letters.

 Another word: ""PLAIT"" -> P, L, A, I, T -> distinct letters. And A is in position 3? But wait, in ""crane"", A was in position 3 and it was yellow meaning it should not be in position 3. So we must avoid putting A in position 3 again.

 In ""PLAIT"":
   Position 1: P
   Position 2: L
   Position 3: A -> this is the same position as in ""crane"", and we know A is not in position 3? But note: the feedback only said that A is in the word but not at position 3. So we must avoid putting A at position 3 in our new guess.

 Therefore, we cannot choose a word that has A at position 3.

 What about ""ALPHA""? It has two A's? But we don't care about duplicates? Actually, better to avoid duplicates until we know more.

 How about ""OASIS""? But has O and I (vowels) and S. But note O and I are new. However, OASIS has two S's? And A is at position 2? That is okay.

 But we are limited: we have to avoid letters C, R, N, E.

 Let me try to think of a word that includes A (any position except 3) and uses common letters that we haven't tried.

 Options: 
   A at position 1: ""ABOUT"" -> A, B, O, U, T -> avoids C,R,N,E. Also checks B, O, U, T.
   A at position 2: ""HANDS"" -> but H, A, N, D, S -> N is absent? We know N is absent (was gray in crane). So we can't use N.

 We must avoid N? Yes: because in crane, N was marked gray (x). So N is absent.

 So ""HANDS"" isn't allowed.

 Option: A at position 4: ""BLACK"" -> but C is absent? We know C is absent. So no.

 Option: A at position 5: ""OPERA"" -> but E and R are absent? So no.

 Another option with A in position 1: ""ADIEU"" -> has A, D, I, E, U -> but E is absent? So avoid E.

 Alternative: ""AUDIO"" -> A, U, D, I, O -> no E and avoids C,R,N. This is good.

 Also, ""AUDIO"" has distinct letters and uses vowels that haven't been tested: U, I, O and the consonant D.

 So I think ""AUDIO"" is a good second guess.

 Let me check: 
   The secret word must contain A (but not at position 1? we don't know, we are putting it at position 1 to see if it's correct or not). 
   We are testing U, D, I, O.

 If the word has A, then we are also testing D, I, O, U.

 So I'll go with ""AUDIO"".

 But note: we have only one guaranteed letter: A. And we are putting it in the first position. We might get:
   If A is in position 1, we'll get a green ✓ for A.
   If not, then we'll get a yellow '-' for A (if the secret word has A only elsewhere) or even gray? But we know A is present because of the previous yellow. So it must be yellow or green in position 1? The feedback will tell us.

 This guess will help narrow down the position of A.

 Therefore, my next guess is ""AUDIO"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- Letters **C, R, N, E** are **absent** from the secret word (all marked ""x"").
- Letter **A** is **present** but **not in Position 3** (marked ""-"" for third position).

Therefore, for the next guess:
1. We must include **A** (since it's in the word) but avoid Position 3.
2. Avoid using **C, R, N, E**.
3. Introduce new common letters to gather more information.

A strategic second guess is **""AUDIO""**:
- Puts ""A"" in Position 1 (safe to test a new position).
- Tests new common vowels (U, I, O) and a consonant (D).
- Contains no reused gray letters (C/R/N/E) or repeated letters.
- Helps verify A's position and checks if other vowels appear.

 How about ""OASIS""? But has O and I (vowels) and S. But note O and I are new. However, OASIS has two S's? And A is at position 2? That is okay.

 But we are limited: we have to avoid letters C, R, N, E.

 Let me try to think of a word that includes A (any position except 3) and uses common letters that we haven't tried.

 Options: 
   A at position 1: ""ABOUT"" -> A, B, O, U, T -> avoids C,R,N,E. Also checks B, O, U, T.
   A at position 2: ""HANDS"" -> but H, A, N, D, S -> N is absent? We know N is absent (was gray in crane). So we can't use N.

 We must avoid N? Yes: because in crane, N was marked gray (x). So N is absent.

 So ""HANDS"" isn't allowed.

 Option: A at position 4: ""BLACK"" -> but C is absent? We know C is absent. So no.

 Option: A at position 5: ""OPERA"" -> but E and R are absent? So no.

 Another option with A in position 1: ""ADIEU"" -> has A, D, I, E, U -> but E is absent? So avoid E.

 Alternative: ""AUDIO"" -> A, U, D, I, O -> no E and avoids C,R,N. This is good.

 Also, ""AUDIO"" has distinct letters and uses vowels that haven't been tested: U, I, O and the consonant D.

 So I think ""AUDIO"" is a good second guess.

 Let me check: 
   The secret word must contain A (but not at position 1? we don't know, we are putting it at position 1 to see if it's correct or not). 
   We are testing U, D, I, O.

 If the word has A, then we are also testing D, I, O, U.

 So I'll go with ""AUDIO"".

 But note: we have only one guaranteed letter: A. And we are putting it in the first position. We might get:
   If A is in position 1, we'll get a green ✓ for A.
   If not, then we'll get a yellow '-' for A (if the secret word has A only elsewhere) or even gray? But we know A is present because of the previous yellow. So it must be yellow or green in position 1? The feedback will tell us.

 This guess will help narrow down the position of A.

 Therefore, my next guess is ""AUDIO"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- Letters **C, R, N, E** are **absent** from the secret word (all marked ""x"").
- Letter **A** is **present** but **not in Position 3** (marked ""-"" for third position).

Therefore, for the next guess:
1. We must include **A** (since it's in the word) but avoid Position 3.
2. Avoid using **C, R, N, E**.
3. Introduce new common letters to gather more information.

A strategic second guess is **""AUDIO""**:
- Puts ""A"" in Position 1 (safe to test a new position).
- Tests new common vowels (U, I, O) and a consonant (D).
- Contains no reused gray letters (C/R/N/E) or repeated letters.
- Helps verify A's position and checks if other vowels appear.

We are given feedback from two guesses.

First guess: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Interpretation:
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (since it's yellow in position 3).
- C, R, N, E are absent from the word.

Second guess: ""audio"" -> Feedback: A(-) U(x) D(x) I(✓) O(x)
Interpretation:
- I is in the word and in the correct position (Position? In ""audio"", I is the fourth letter, so Position 4 is correct and the letter is I).
- A is present (we know that) but not in position 1 (since yellow, meaning wrong position).
- U, D, O are absent.

So our current knowledge:
1. The secret word contains A and I.
   - A is not in position 1 (from second guess) and not in position 3 (from first guess).
   - I is fixed in position 4 (because it's green in the second guess, meaning the fourth letter is I).

2. Absent letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, O.

Also, we know from the first guess that A is present, so it must be in position 2 or 5 (since positions 1, 3 are ruled out, and position 4 is I). But wait, there are only five positions. So positions: 1,2,3,4,5. We have ruled out position 1 (from second guess) and position 3 (from first guess). Position 4 is I. Therefore, A must be in position 2 or 5.

Current constraints:
- Position 4: must be I (green).
- A must be either in position 2 or 5.

We need to form a word that:
- Has I in position 4.
- Contains A in either position 2 or 5.
- Does not use any of the absent letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, O.
- Also, since we have only a few guesses left (this is guess 3 out of 6), we want to test more common letters.

Given that, let's try to choose a word that places A in position 2 first (we can test one possibility) and uses new common letters for the other positions.

Available letters: avoiding C,R,N,E,U,D,O. Many consonants left: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z. And vowels left: only A and I are possibly used? But we have A already to place, and I is fixed. Other vowels are E (absent), O, U (absent). So no other vowels? But Y can be a vowel. So we may consider Y.

Possible words:

If we put A in position 2, then the pattern would be: _ A _ I ?
But position 4 is I, so we need a letter for position 1, 3, and 5.

Let me try: 
Position 1: let's try a consonant, say S, T, L, etc.
Position 3: ???
Position 5: ???

Word: ? A ? I ?

Example: 
- ""satis""? Not a word.
- ""basis"": but it has S repeated? Also, we don't know if S is in the word. And B? We can try.
But basis: B(1), A(2), S(3), I(4), S(5) -> two S. Not ideal? But we might try.

But note: we have eliminated many letters. We can also try to put A in position 5.

Option 1: A in position 2 -> then letters 1,3,5 are unknowns.

Option 2: A in position 5 -> then the word ends with A, and we have positions 1,2,3 unknown.

Since we have I fixed at position 4, both options are possible.

But to maximize new letters, let me think of words.

Common words with I in position 4 and A in position 2: e.g., ""BASIS"", ""RADIO"" but R and O are absent (R is absent, O absent). So ""RADIO"" is invalid.

Another: ""TALIS"" - not a valid word.

With A in position 5: words like ... ? Let me list words ending with I? No, the fourth letter is I and then fifth is A? So ...I A? So the word ends with ""IA"" but then position 5 must be A? Actually: the word ends with ...I (position 4) and position 5 must be A? So the word pattern: _ _ _ I A.

For example: 
- ""MANIA"": but M, A, N, I, A? N is absent, so invalid.
- ""MEDIA"": M, E, D, I, A -> E and D are absent? And E and D are absent? So invalid.
- ""LEGIA"" - not a word.
- ""LOGIA"" - but O is absent? 
- ""TAXIA"": not common? Probably not.

Perhaps words like ""MAFIA"": M, A, F, I, A? But note it has two A's? 
In ""MAFIA"": positions: 1:M, 2:A, 3:F, 4:I, 5:A? 
But we can use M and F? They haven't been tested. But note: in our pattern, if we put A in position 2, we get a word. And for A in position 5, same word? Actually, in ""MAFIA"", A appears at position 2 and 5? So if we use this, we test both positions? That would be efficient.

Wait, the pattern for MAFIA:
- Position 2: A (if the secret word has A at position 2, then we get green for A? Or at position 5? But we are placing A in both positions? So if the word has A at position 2, then we get green at position 2 and yellow at position 5? Or what? Only one A? But if the word has only one A, then we might get one yellow? But the secret word might have two A's? We don't know.

Similarly, we can try ""MAFIA"" with no absent letters? M, A, F, I, A: absent letters are avoided? C, R, N, E, U, D, O are absent? So M, F, and I are allowed? I is present. So MAFIA: we are testing M at position 1, A at position 2, F at position 3, I at position 4 (we know I is at 4 so that will be green), A at position 5.

But we are not sure if A is at position 2 or 5? We know A is either 2 or 5. In this one word, we can test both possibilities? However, note that the word MAFIA may not be in the word list? But it's a valid English word.

Another choice: ""STAIR"" but has R? And R is absent. So no.

Alternatively, let me pick a word that puts A only in one position to avoid confusion? But having A in both has benefits because:
- If we get green at position 2, we know position 2 is correct and then position 5 is extra? But we'll see the feedback.

So if we guess ""MAFIA"":
- If A is at position 2: then position 2 would be green, and position 5 for A would be gray (if no second A) or yellow if there's another A at another position? Not needed? But we know there is at least one A. So if there is only one A, then position 5 would be gray? Then we would know A is at position 2. And if we get yellow at position 2? That would not happen because yellow means present but wrong position? So for position 2: if A is actually in position 5, then we should get yellow for position 2? But let me clarify the expected feedback:

Scenario 1: secret word has A only at position 2 and not at 5.
- Guess: M A F I A
- Position 2: A is present and correct? green.
- Position 5: A is absent? But the secret word has only one A? Then position 5 A would be gray? But actually, we have two A's in guess? The feedback should mark only if the letter is found? It's per occurrence? 
Actually, the rules of Wordle: each letter in the guess is marked independently. For repeated letters, if the secret word has only one A, then one of the A's will be yellow or green and the other gray? Because it's matching the occurrence.

To avoid confusion, maybe not use words with repeated letters? 

Alternatively, we could choose a word that has A only in one of the possible positions? But that might take more guesses. 

Therefore, I prefer to choose a word that uses as many unguessed letters as possible, without duplication? And without the absent letters.

So letters not yet tried: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, S, T, V, X, Y, Z.

Now, we have pattern: letter1 I is fixed at position 4? So positions: 1, 2, 3, and 5? But position 4 is I? So pattern: [letter1] [position2: might be A or not] [letter3] I [letter5]

But since we don't know about position2 for A? Actually, we know that A must be at position2 or position5? So:

Case A: pattern ... I A (if position5 is A)
Case B: pattern . A . I . (if position2 is A)

We must pick one case? Or we can have both in one word? 

Let me try Case B: position2 is A.

So pattern: ? A ? I ? 

We need a word that has A at position2, and I at position4. 

Examples: 
- ""BAILS"": B, A, I, L, S? Position: B(1), A(2), I(3) -> but wait, position3? We need position4? Actually, must be: letter1=A? No: position2=A, then at position4 must be I? So: 
Word structure: [1] A [3] I [5]

So: ""BAIT"", four letters?
Five letters: ""BASIS"" -> B,A,S,I,S -> S repeated? Positions: 1:B, 2:A, 3:S, 4:I, 5:S? Valid? And let's see absent letters: avoid R etc? B, A, S, I, S -> S appears twice? But absent letters are not in B,A,S,I? So acceptable? However, S repeated.

""BAPUS""? Not a word.

""TAVIB""? Not word.

Another: ""HASH"" too short? Five letters? ""HABIT"": H,A,B,I,T? Positions: H(1), A(2), B(3), I(4)? Position4 is I? Yes. Then T(5). So ""HABIT"".

But note: in ""HABIT"", it has positions: 1:H, 2:A, 3:B, 4:I, 5:T. And letters are not among the absent ones: C, R, N, E, U, D, O? So H, B, T new.

So we can try ""habit"".

But wait: we have not tested H, B, T.

Now, if we choose ""HABIT"", we expect:

If A is at position2 and I at position4, then:
- Position2: A should be green? Because we're putting it at position2? Then if A is indeed at position2, then it will be green. Otherwise, if A is at position5, then it will be yellow at position2? Because we know A must be at position2 or position5. If it is at position5, then in ""HABIT"", position2 A would be yellow? And position5: we put T? Then position5 would be unknown? But the secret word has A at position5? Then we would get gray at position5? And yellow at position2? That tells us A is at position5.

So ""HABIT"" is a reasonable guess.

Alternatively: to cover the other case, let me see a word that has A at position5? Then pattern: ... I A? So [1],[2],[3],I,A.

Word: ""ALPHA""? But L,P,H? And A at position5? But we also have A at position1? So a different word? Without repetition? 

""ATOPIA""? Not a word? ""CAMPA"" not valid? 
""ARRAY"" - has R? Absent? 
""ALLIA"" - not common? 
""MANGA"" - has N? Absent? 
""PANGA"" has N? 
""LAMIA"": L,A,M,I,A? Positions: L(1), A(2), M(3), I(4), A(5). This has A at both position2 and position5? Then we can test both? But again repetition? 

""LAMIA"" is a valid word? Let's assume it is? Then similar to MAFIA? 

But to avoid repetition, let me choose ""HABIT"" regardless? 

Another option: ""STAIN""? Has S,T,A,I,N? But N is absent? We cannot use N.

""PLAID"": P,L,A,I,D? But D is absent? So D not allowed.

""MATCH""? But C is absent.

""PASTS""? A? We can consider? Or ""PASTY""? P,A,S,T,Y? But positions? 
We need position4=I? So ""PASTY"" has Y at position5? And no I? So invalid? 

Therefore, maybe ""HABIT"" or ""MAFIA"". 

I think ""HABIT"" is better because it has distinct letters except? H,A,B,I,T: all distinct. So better than ""MAFIA"" which repeats A? Wait in ""HABIT"": distinct, yes. 

Or ""BASTI""? Not word? 

Another word: ""GAILY"" -> G,A,I,L,Y? Positions: G(1),A(2),I(3)? Not position4? 

We need I exactly at position4? 

Word with I at position4: e.g., ""MAGIC"" but M,A,G,I,C? C is absent? Not allowed.

""VALID""? V,A,L,I,D? But D absent? 

So back to ""HABIT"".

Therefore, I'll choose ""HABIT"".

But let's confirm: ""HABIT"" is a valid English word? Yes.

So we are guessing ""HABIT"".

In summary:
- The guess ""HABIT"" will help locate A: 
  - If A is at position2, then we should get green at position2? 
  - If A is at position5, then we should get yellow at position2? And gray at position5? 
- And we test new letters: H, B, T.

Also, position4 I we know is green? Since we already know I is at position4? Yes, so position4 will be green? So we can expect ""HABIT"" to show I green?

Actually, the secret word has I at position4? Yes, so we are guaranteed green at position4.

Therefore, the feedback will tell us about H at position1, A at position2, B at position3, T at position5? And I at position4 green? 

That's fine.

So new guess: ""HABIT""

Now I will put it in the format.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: A is present but not in position 3; C, R, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (audio)**: I is in the word at position 4 (green ""✓""); A is present but not in position 1 (yellow ""-""); U, D, O are absent.

### Current Knowledge:
- **Secret word must contain**: A (positions 2 or 5) and I (fixed at position 4).
- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, U, D, O.
- **Position constraints**: 
  - Position 1: Unknown, must avoid A (since A isn’t here) and absent letters.
  - Position 2: Could be A if not position 5.
  - Position 3: Unknown.
  - Position 4: Must be I (confirmed green).
  - Position 5: Could be A if not position 2.

For the next guess:
- Focus on testing if **A is in position 2 or 5** while introducing new common letters (avoiding absent ones: C, R, N, E, U, D, O).
- Choose a word with **I in position 4** and **A in position 2** (to test one hypothesis) and probe other positions with unused letters. This maximizes new information.
- Ideal guess: **HABIT** (valid 5-letter word).
  - Positions: 
    - 1: H (new, checks common consonant).
    - 2: A (tests if A is here—green if correct, yellow if A is at position 5 instead).
    - 3: B (new, common letter).
    - 4: I (green ""✓"", confirmed).
    - 5: T (new, common consonant).

If A is at position 2, feedback shows green; if at position 5, feedback shows yellow at position 2 and gray at position 5 (since HABIT uses T at position 5). This efficiently narrows possibilities.

First guess: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Interpretation:
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (since it's yellow in position 3).
- C, R, N, E are absent from the word.

Second guess: ""audio"" -> Feedback: A(-) U(x) D(x) I(✓) O(x)
Interpretation:
- I is in the word and in the correct position (Position? In ""audio"", I is the fourth letter, so Position 4 is correct and the letter is I).
- A is present (we know that) but not in position 1 (since yellow, meaning wrong position).
- U, D, O are absent.

So our current knowledge:
1. The secret word contains A and I.
   - A is not in position 1 (from second guess) and not in position 3 (from first guess).
   - I is fixed in position 4 (because it's green in the second guess, meaning the fourth letter is I).

2. Absent letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, O.

Also, we know from the first guess that A is present, so it must be in position 2 or 5 (since positions 1, 3 are ruled out, and position 4 is I). But wait, there are only five positions. So positions: 1,2,3,4,5. We have ruled out position 1 (from second guess) and position 3 (from first guess). Position 4 is I. Therefore, A must be in position 2 or 5.

Current constraints:
- Position 4: must be I (green).
- A must be either in position 2 or 5.

We need to form a word that:
- Has I in position 4.
- Contains A in either position 2 or 5.
- Does not use any of the absent letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, O.
- Also, since we have only a few guesses left (this is guess 3 out of 6), we want to test more common letters.

Given that, let's try to choose a word that places A in position 2 first (we can test one possibility) and uses new common letters for the other positions.

Available letters: avoiding C,R,N,E,U,D,O. Many consonants left: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z. And vowels left: only A and I are possibly used? But we have A already to place, and I is fixed. Other vowels are E (absent), O, U (absent). So no other vowels? But Y can be a vowel. So we may consider Y.

Possible words:

If we put A in position 2, then the pattern would be: _ A _ I ?
But position 4 is I, so we need a letter for position 1, 3, and 5.

Let me try: 
Position 1: let's try a consonant, say S, T, L, etc.
Position 3: ???
Position 5: ???

Word: ? A ? I ?

Example: 
- ""satis""? Not a word.
- ""basis"": but it has S repeated? Also, we don't know if S is in the word. And B? We can try.
But basis: B(1), A(2), S(3), I(4), S(5) -> two S. Not ideal? But we might try.

But note: we have eliminated many letters. We can also try to put A in position 5.

Option 1: A in position 2 -> then letters 1,3,5 are unknowns.

Option 2: A in position 5 -> then the word ends with A, and we have positions 1,2,3 unknown.

Since we have I fixed at position 4, both options are possible.

But to maximize new letters, let me think of words.

Common words with I in position 4 and A in position 2: e.g., ""BASIS"", ""RADIO"" but R and O are absent (R is absent, O absent). So ""RADIO"" is invalid.

Another: ""TALIS"" - not a valid word.

With A in position 5: words like ... ? Let me list words ending with I? No, the fourth letter is I and then fifth is A? So ...I A? So the word ends with ""IA"" but then position 5 must be A? Actually: the word ends with ...I (position 4) and position 5 must be A? So the word pattern: _ _ _ I A.

For example: 
- ""MANIA"": but M, A, N, I, A? N is absent, so invalid.
- ""MEDIA"": M, E, D, I, A -> E and D are absent? And E and D are absent? So invalid.
- ""LEGIA"" - not a word.
- ""LOGIA"" - but O is absent? 
- ""TAXIA"": not common? Probably not.

Perhaps words like ""MAFIA"": M, A, F, I, A? But note it has two A's? 
In ""MAFIA"": positions: 1:M, 2:A, 3:F, 4:I, 5:A? 
But we can use M and F? They haven't been tested. But note: in our pattern, if we put A in position 2, we get a word. And for A in position 5, same word? Actually, in ""MAFIA"", A appears at position 2 and 5? So if we use this, we test both positions? That would be efficient.

Wait, the pattern for MAFIA:
- Position 2: A (if the secret word has A at position 2, then we get green for A? Or at position 5? But we are placing A in both positions? So if the word has A at position 2, then we get green at position 2 and yellow at position 5? Or what? Only one A? But if the word has only one A, then we might get one yellow? But the secret word might have two A's? We don't know.

Similarly, we can try ""MAFIA"" with no absent letters? M, A, F, I, A: absent letters are avoided? C, R, N, E, U, D, O are absent? So M, F, and I are allowed? I is present. So MAFIA: we are testing M at position 1, A at position 2, F at position 3, I at position 4 (we know I is at 4 so that will be green), A at position 5.

But we are not sure if A is at position 2 or 5? We know A is either 2 or 5. In this one word, we can test both possibilities? However, note that the word MAFIA may not be in the word list? But it's a valid English word.

Another choice: ""STAIR"" but has R? And R is absent. So no.

Alternatively, let me pick a word that puts A only in one position to avoid confusion? But having A in both has benefits because:
- If we get green at position 2, we know position 2 is correct and then position 5 is extra? But we'll see the feedback.

So if we guess ""MAFIA"":
- If A is at position 2: then position 2 would be green, and position 5 for A would be gray (if no second A) or yellow if there's another A at another position? Not needed? But we know there is at least one A. So if there is only one A, then position 5 would be gray? Then we would know A is at position 2. And if we get yellow at position 2? That would not happen because yellow means present but wrong position? So for position 2: if A is actually in position 5, then we should get yellow for position 2? But let me clarify the expected feedback:

Scenario 1: secret word has A only at position 2 and not at 5.
- Guess: M A F I A
- Position 2: A is present and correct? green.
- Position 5: A is absent? But the secret word has only one A? Then position 5 A would be gray? But actually, we have two A's in guess? The feedback should mark only if the letter is found? It's per occurrence? 
Actually, the rules of Wordle: each letter in the guess is marked independently. For repeated letters, if the secret word has only one A, then one of the A's will be yellow or green and the other gray? Because it's matching the occurrence.

To avoid confusion, maybe not use words with repeated letters? 

Alternatively, we could choose a word that has A only in one of the possible positions? But that might take more guesses. 

Therefore, I prefer to choose a word that uses as many unguessed letters as possible, without duplication? And without the absent letters.

So letters not yet tried: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, S, T, V, X, Y, Z.

Now, we have pattern: letter1 I is fixed at position 4? So positions: 1, 2, 3, and 5? But position 4 is I? So pattern: [letter1] [position2: might be A or not] [letter3] I [letter5]

But since we don't know about position2 for A? Actually, we know that A must be at position2 or position5? So:

Case A: pattern ... I A (if position5 is A)
Case B: pattern . A . I . (if position2 is A)

We must pick one case? Or we can have both in one word? 

Let me try Case B: position2 is A.

So pattern: ? A ? I ? 

We need a word that has A at position2, and I at position4. 

Examples: 
- ""BAILS"": B, A, I, L, S? Position: B(1), A(2), I(3) -> but wait, position3? We need position4? Actually, must be: letter1=A? No: position2=A, then at position4 must be I? So: 
Word structure: [1] A [3] I [5]

So: ""BAIT"", four letters?
Five letters: ""BASIS"" -> B,A,S,I,S -> S repeated? Positions: 1:B, 2:A, 3:S, 4:I, 5:S? Valid? And let's see absent letters: avoid R etc? B, A, S, I, S -> S appears twice? But absent letters are not in B,A,S,I? So acceptable? However, S repeated.

""BAPUS""? Not a word.

""TAVIB""? Not word.

Another: ""HASH"" too short? Five letters? ""HABIT"": H,A,B,I,T? Positions: H(1), A(2), B(3), I(4)? Position4 is I? Yes. Then T(5). So ""HABIT"".

But note: in ""HABIT"", it has positions: 1:H, 2:A, 3:B, 4:I, 5:T. And letters are not among the absent ones: C, R, N, E, U, D, O? So H, B, T new.

So we can try ""habit"".

But wait: we have not tested H, B, T.

Now, if we choose ""HABIT"", we expect:

If A is at position2 and I at position4, then:
- Position2: A should be green? Because we're putting it at position2? Then if A is indeed at position2, then it will be green. Otherwise, if A is at position5, then it will be yellow at position2? Because we know A must be at position2 or position5. If it is at position5, then in ""HABIT"", position2 A would be yellow? And position5: we put T? Then position5 would be unknown? But the secret word has A at position5? Then we would get gray at position5? And yellow at position2? That tells us A is at position5.

So ""HABIT"" is a reasonable guess.

Alternatively: to cover the other case, let me see a word that has A at position5? Then pattern: ... I A? So [1],[2],[3],I,A.

Word: ""ALPHA""? But L,P,H? And A at position5? But we also have A at position1? So a different word? Without repetition? 

""ATOPIA""? Not a word? ""CAMPA"" not valid? 
""ARRAY"" - has R? Absent? 
""ALLIA"" - not common? 
""MANGA"" - has N? Absent? 
""PANGA"" has N? 
""LAMIA"": L,A,M,I,A? Positions: L(1), A(2), M(3), I(4), A(5). This has A at both position2 and position5? Then we can test both? But again repetition? 

""LAMIA"" is a valid word? Let's assume it is? Then similar to MAFIA? 

But to avoid repetition, let me choose ""HABIT"" regardless? 

Another option: ""STAIN""? Has S,T,A,I,N? But N is absent? We cannot use N.

""PLAID"": P,L,A,I,D? But D is absent? So D not allowed.

""MATCH""? But C is absent.

""PASTS""? A? We can consider? Or ""PASTY""? P,A,S,T,Y? But positions? 
We need position4=I? So ""PASTY"" has Y at position5? And no I? So invalid? 

Therefore, maybe ""HABIT"" or ""MAFIA"". 

I think ""HABIT"" is better because it has distinct letters except? H,A,B,I,T: all distinct. So better than ""MAFIA"" which repeats A? Wait in ""HABIT"": distinct, yes. 

Or ""BASTI""? Not word? 

Another word: ""GAILY"" -> G,A,I,L,Y? Positions: G(1),A(2),I(3)? Not position4? 

We need I exactly at position4? 

Word with I at position4: e.g., ""MAGIC"" but M,A,G,I,C? C is absent? Not allowed.

""VALID""? V,A,L,I,D? But D absent? 

So back to ""HABIT"".

Therefore, I'll choose ""HABIT"".

But let's confirm: ""HABIT"" is a valid English word? Yes.

So we are guessing ""HABIT"".

In summary:
- The guess ""HABIT"" will help locate A: 
  - If A is at position2, then we should get green at position2? 
  - If A is at position5, then we should get yellow at position2? And gray at position5? 
- And we test new letters: H, B, T.

Also, position4 I we know is green? Since we already know I is at position4? Yes, so position4 will be green? So we can expect ""HABIT"" to show I green?

Actually, the secret word has I at position4? Yes, so we are guaranteed green at position4.

Therefore, the feedback will tell us about H at position1, A at position2, B at position3, T at position5? And I at position4 green? 

That's fine.

So new guess: ""HABIT""

Now I will put it in the format.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: A is present but not in position 3; C, R, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (audio)**: I is in the word at position 4 (green ""✓""); A is present but not in position 1 (yellow ""-""); U, D, O are absent.

### Current Knowledge:
- **Secret word must contain**: A (positions 2 or 5) and I (fixed at position 4).
- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, U, D, O.
- **Position constraints**: 
  - Position 1: Unknown, must avoid A (since A isn’t here) and absent letters.
  - Position 2: Could be A if not position 5.
  - Position 3: Unknown.
  - Position 4: Must be I (confirmed green).
  - Position 5: Could be A if not position 2.

For the next guess:
- Focus on testing if **A is in position 2 or 5** while introducing new common letters (avoiding absent ones: C, R, N, E, U, D, O).
- Choose a word with **I in position 4** and **A in position 2** (to test one hypothesis) and probe other positions with unused letters. This maximizes new information.
- Ideal guess: **HABIT** (valid 5-letter word).
  - Positions: 
    - 1: H (new, checks common consonant).
    - 2: A (tests if A is here—green if correct, yellow if A is at position 5 instead).
    - 3: B (new, common letter).
    - 4: I (green ""✓"", confirmed).
    - 5: T (new, common consonant).

If A is at position 2, feedback shows green; if at position 5, feedback shows yellow at position 2 and gray at position 5 (since HABIT uses T at position 5). This efficiently narrows possibilities.",Guess 3: habit -> FEEDBACK: H(✓) A(✓) B(✓) I(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
