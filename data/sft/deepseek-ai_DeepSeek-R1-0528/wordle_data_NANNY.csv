We are making the first guess. We don't have any information yet. 
 A good starting word should have repeating letters? But 5-letter with no repeats? 
 Actually, it's often better to have a word with common letters and distinct to cover more ground.
 Let me pick a word that has letters that are frequently used in English: e.g., vowels: A, E, I and common consonants: R, S, T, N.
 One of the popular starting words is ""SLATE"" because it has S, L, A, T, E -> which are common and it covers two vowels (A and E) and three common consonants.

 However, note: We don't know the word list? But we are allowed to guess any valid English word. I'll go with ""SLATE"".

 But note: the problem says ""valid 5-letter English word"", so I have to choose a word that I know is valid.

 Alternative: ""CRANE"" is also a common starter? It has C, R, A, N, E -> two vowels (A and E) and three consonants.

 Actually, let me choose ""ROATE"". Wait, is that common? Maybe not. 

 Actually, I recall that ""STARE"" is a good starter? It has S, T, A, R, E -> two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants.

 But to maximize distinct letters and common ones, I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E. 

 However, I can also choose ""SLATE"" or ""TRACE"". 

 I think I'll pick ""CRATE"" because it covers C, R, A, T, E -> which includes common consonants and two vowels (A and E). 

 Wait, let me decide: 

 Option 1: SLATE -> letters: S, L, A, T, E
 Option 2: CRANE -> C, R, A, N, E
 Option 3: TRACE -> T, R, A, C, E -> same as CRATE? Actually CRATE: C,R,A,T,E

 Actually, to have a good coverage, I will choose ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".
</think>
For the first guess, I need a word that maximizes information by including common vowels and consonants. Letters like R, S, T, L, N, E, and A provide broad coverage. ""CRANE"" includes C, R, A, N, E—common letters with minimal repetition. This will give solid feedback on frequent consonants and vowels while leaving room for adjustments in subsequent guesses.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: ✓ (correct position, so the word has N as the 4th letter)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
1. The 4th letter is N.
2. The letter A is in the word, but not in the 3rd position (since it was in the 3rd in CRANE and got a dash).
3. The letters C, R, and E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Must have an A somewhere (but not in position 3) and must have N in position 4.

Also, we know the word does not contain C, R, or E.

Now, for the next guess, we want to try to find the positions of A and also cover other common letters that haven't been tried yet.

We have used: C, R, A, N, E. So we should avoid these except A and N (which we know are in the word). But note: R and E are out, so we cannot use them.

Available letters: We can use any letters except C, R, E. Also, we know A is in the word but not in position 3, and N is fixed at position 4.

We must form a 5-letter word that has:
- The 4th letter as N (because we know it's correct and in place).
- The letter A must appear, but not in the 3rd position.

Also, we want to test other common letters to get more information.

Common consonants we haven't tried: S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.

We can try to put A in a different position (like 1st or 2nd or 5th) and also test other vowels? But note, we have only one vowel so far (A) and we know E is out. So other vowels: I, O, U? But we don't know if they are present.

Let's think of words that have:
- 4th letter is N
- Include A (but not in 3rd position)
- Do not include C, R, E

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, or 5.

We also want to cover new letters.

Let me try to think of words that end with N and have A.

For example:
- Words with A in the first position: e.g., ""A__ N"", but the 4th is N, so the word pattern: A _ _ N _ 
- Or A in the second: _ A _ N _
- Or A in the fifth: _ _ _ N A

But note: we have to avoid C, R, E.

Let's list some words:

Option 1: A in the first position: e.g., ""ADMIN"" -> but has M and D, and I. But we don't know about these letters. Also, the 4th is N? ADMIN: A D M I N -> positions: 1:A, 2:D, 3:M, 4:I, 5:N -> wait, that doesn't have N at 4th? Actually, the 4th is I and 5th is N. So not.

We need the 4th letter to be N. So the word must be: _ _ _ N _

So, for A in first: A _ _ N _
For example: ""ALIGN"" -> A L I G N -> but 4th is G? No, positions: 1:A, 2:L, 3:I, 4:G, 5:N -> not N at 4th.

We need the 4th letter to be N, so the word pattern: ?1 ?2 ?3 N ?5

So, for A in first: A ?2 ?3 N ?5
For example: ""ASIAN"" -> A S I A N -> but that has two A's? And positions: 1:A, 2:S, 3:I, 4:A, 5:N -> 4th is A, not N. So no.

Another: ""AVIAN"" -> A V I A N -> 1:A, 2:V, 3:I, 4:A, 5:N -> again 4th is A.

We need the 4th to be N. So the word must have the 4th letter as N.

Examples of words with 4th letter N:
- ...N. -> like ""URBAN"", ""TRAIN"", but we cannot use R (and TRAIN has R and we know R is not in the word). Also, URBAN has R and U, but R is out.

Without R and E and C.

Let me think: 
- ""PLAIN"" -> P L A I N -> but here A is in the 3rd position? We know A cannot be in 3rd because in the first guess A was in 3rd and got a dash (meaning it's in the word but not in 3rd). So in PLAIN, if we put A in 3rd, that would be the same position? But we are allowed to use A again? But the feedback said A is in the word but not in 3rd, so we should avoid putting A in 3rd again because we know it's not there.

But in PLAIN, the pattern is: P L A I N -> so 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:I, 5:N -> but we need 4th to be N? Here 4th is I and 5th is N. So not.

We need the 4th to be N. So the word must be: ?1 ?2 ?3 N ?5

So, for example: 
- ""BEGAN"" -> B E G A N -> but E is out (we know E is not in the word) and also 4th is A? 1:B, 2:E, 3:G, 4:A, 5:N -> 4th is A, not N.

Another: ""BEGIN"" -> B E G I N -> E is out.

""LOGIN"" -> L O G I N -> 4th is I, 5th is N -> not 4th as N.

We need the 4th letter to be N. So the word must have the structure: ...N? meaning the fourth letter is N and then the fifth is something.

Examples: 
- ""FJORD"" -> but has R and we know R is out.
- ""DEMON"" -> D E M O N -> E is out.

Without E and R and C.

How about: ""SAUNA"" -> S A U N A -> 1:S, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:A -> yes! 4th is N. And A is in 2nd and 5th, not 3rd. Also, no C, R, E.

But is SAUNA a valid word? Yes, it is.

But we have two A's? That's okay.

But we also have S and U to test.

Another word: ""MANGA"" -> M A N G A -> but 3rd is N? 1:M, 2:A, 3:N, 4:G, 5:A -> 4th is G, not N.

""PIANO"" -> P I A N O -> 1:P, 2:I, 3:A, 4:N, 5:O -> 4th is N! And A is in 3rd? But we know A cannot be in 3rd? Because in the first guess, A was in 3rd and got a dash. So if we put A in 3rd again, it would be wrong. But in PIANO, A is in 3rd, which we know is incorrect. So we should avoid that.

We need a word that has A not in 3rd and 4th is N.

So, back to ""SAUNA"": 
- Positions: 1:S, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:A -> A is in 2nd and 5th, not 3rd. So that's okay.

But we have two A's? The feedback only told us that A is in the word (at least one), but it might have more? So that's possible.

Another word: ""TAWNY"" -> T A W N Y -> 1:T, 2:A, 3:W, 4:N, 5:Y -> 4th is N, and A in 2nd. And no C, R, E.

But we don't know if Y is in the word? But that's okay.

""DAUNT"" -> D A U N T -> 1:D, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:T -> 4th is N, A in 2nd.

""VAUNT"" -> V A U N T -> same.

But we haven't tested many new letters.

We also want to cover more vowels? We have A already, but we don't know about I, O, U.

In SAUNA, we test S, A, U, N, A. But we already know N is in the 4th and correct, and A is in the word. So we are testing S and U.

In TAWNY, we test T, A, W, N, Y.

We might also consider words that put A in the 5th position? For example: _ _ _ N A

Like ""PIZZA"" -> but has Z and Z, and 4th is Z? 1:P, 2:I, 3:Z, 4:Z, 5:A -> not N at 4th.

""JUMNA"" -> not a word.

""TUNNA"" -> not common.

""DUNA"" -> not 5 letters.

So, let's go with ""TAWNY"" or ""SAUNA"". 

But note: in SAUNA, the 5th letter is A, which we already know is in the word. So if we get a dash for the 5th A, we know it's because it's in the word but not there? But we don't know if there is a second A. It might be redundant.

Similarly, in TAWNY, we have Y which is less common.

Another word: ""PLAIN"" is not because 4th is not N.

""TRAIN"" has R which is out.

How about ""SHINY"" -> S H I N Y -> 1:S, 2:H, 3:I, 4:N, 5:Y -> 4th is N? But we need to include A? We know A is in the word, so we must include A in the guess? Because if we don't, we might miss information about A.

Important: We know A is in the word, so we should try to find its position. Therefore, our next guess must include A (but not in the 3rd position) and have N in the 4th.

So, we cannot avoid including A.

Therefore, let's choose a word that has A and N (at 4th) and three new letters.

Options:
- ""SAUNA"": tests S, A, U, N, A -> but A is repeated. We test S and U. The 5th A might be redundant.
- ""TAWNY"": tests T, A, W, N, Y -> new letters: T, W, Y.
- ""DAUNT"": tests D, A, U, N, T -> new letters: D, U, T.

""FAUNA"": F A U N A -> similar to SAUNA.

""LAUAN"": not common.

""MAUNA"": not common.

""PAWNS"": P A W N S -> 1:P, 2:A, 3:W, 4:N, 5:S -> 4th is N? Yes. And A in 2nd. New letters: P, W, S.

But we already tried S? In the first guess we didn't use S. First guess was CRANE: C, R, A, N, E. So S is new.

But in PAWNS, the 4th is N? Let's check: P-A-W-N-S -> positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:W, 4:N, 5:S -> yes, 4th is N.

And A is in 2nd, not 3rd.

Also, no C, R, E.

So, PAWNS: P, A, W, N, S.

We test P, W, S, and we already know A and N (N is fixed).

But note: we are testing A in the 2nd position.

Similarly, we could do ""MAWNS"" or ""DAWNS"", but DAWNS has D and S.

But PAWNS is a valid word.

Another option: ""GAUNT"": G A U N T -> 1:G, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:T -> 4th is N? Actually, 4th is N? G-A-U-N-T -> 1:G, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:T -> yes.

And A in 2nd.

But we have U and T.

I think PAWNS or GAUNT are good.

But let's choose one that has more common letters.

Common consonants: S, T, L, N, etc. We have N already.

We haven't tried S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.

In PAWNS, we test P, A, W, N, S -> W is less common? But we need to test.

In GAUNT, we test G, A, U, N, T -> U is a vowel, which might be useful.

But we know the word has A, and we don't know about other vowels.

Another word: ""PLANK"" -> P L A N K -> 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:K -> but A is in 3rd, which we know is incorrect. So avoid.

""THANK"" -> T H A N K -> 1:T, 2:H, 3:A, 4:N, 5:K -> again A in 3rd, avoid.

""STAIN"" -> S T A I N -> 1:S, 2:T, 3:A, 4:I, 5:N -> 4th is I, not N. So no.

We must have 4th as N.

So, let's go with ""PAWNS"". It tests P, A, W, N, S.

But note: the word PAWNS has S at the end, which is common.

Alternatively, ""TAWNY"" tests T, A, W, N, Y.

I think PAWNS is better because S is more common than Y.

But we can also consider ""SANDY"" -> but 4th is D? S A N D Y -> 1:S, 2:A, 3:N, 4:D, 5:Y -> 3rd is N, not 4th. So no.

""BANDY"" -> B A N D Y -> 3rd is N? 1:B, 2:A, 3:N, 4:D, 5:Y -> not 4th as N.

So, I think ""PAWNS"" is a good choice.

But let me confirm: the word is PAWNS, meaning to take something in a greedy way? Or the plural of pawn? It's a valid word.

Another common word: ""PLANT"" -> but 4th is N? P L A N T -> 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:T -> 4th is N? Actually, 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:T -> yes, 4th is N. But A is in 3rd? We know A cannot be in 3rd. So avoid.

Similarly, ""SLANT"" -> same issue.

So, we need to avoid A in 3rd.

Therefore, I choose ""PAWNS"".

But in PAWNS, the A is in 2nd, which is good.

So, my next guess: PAWNS.

But note: we are not forced to put N in the 4th? Actually, we know that N is in the 4th position, so we can keep it there to get more information about other positions.

If we don't put N in the 4th, we might not learn about the other positions? But we know it's fixed, so we can use that to our advantage.

So, I'll go with PAWNS.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, R, and E are not in the word (x).
- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position (-).
- N is in the word and correctly placed in the 4th position (✓).

Key insights:
- The secret word has N as the 4th letter.
- A is present but not in the 3rd position (so it must be in position 1, 2, or 5).
- The word does not contain C, R, or E.
- For the next guess, we should:
  - Retain N in the 4th position to confirm it (though it's already confirmed, this helps test other letters).
  - Include A in a new position (1, 2, or 5) to narrow down its location.
  - Avoid C, R, and E entirely.
  - Test new common letters (e.g., S, T, P, L, D) to gather more information.

After evaluating possible words, ""PAWNS"" is a strong choice because:
- It places A in the 2nd position (a new spot to test).
- It keeps N in the 4th position.
- It tests new common letters: P, W, and S.
- It avoids C, R, E and does not repeat the 3rd-position A error.
- ""PAWNS"" is a valid 5-letter English word (meaning to gamble or pledge).

This guess will provide feedback on:
- Whether A is in the 2nd position (✓ or -).
- Whether P, W, or S are in the word and their positions.

<guess>PAWNS</guess>",PAWNS,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: ✓ (correct position, so the word has N as the 4th letter)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
1. The 4th letter is N.
2. The letter A is in the word, but not in the 3rd position (since it was in the 3rd in CRANE and got a dash).
3. The letters C, R, and E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Must have an A somewhere (but not in position 3) and must have N in position 4.

Also, we know the word does not contain C, R, or E.

Now, for the next guess, we want to try to find the positions of A and also cover other common letters that haven't been tried yet.

We have used: C, R, A, N, E. So we should avoid these except A and N (which we know are in the word). But note: R and E are out, so we cannot use them.

Available letters: We can use any letters except C, R, E. Also, we know A is in the word but not in position 3, and N is fixed at position 4.

We must form a 5-letter word that has:
- The 4th letter as N (because we know it's correct and in place).
- The letter A must appear, but not in the 3rd position.

Also, we want to test other common letters to get more information.

Common consonants we haven't tried: S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.

We can try to put A in a different position (like 1st or 2nd or 5th) and also test other vowels? But note, we have only one vowel so far (A) and we know E is out. So other vowels: I, O, U? But we don't know if they are present.

Let's think of words that have:
- 4th letter is N
- Include A (but not in 3rd position)
- Do not include C, R, E

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, or 5.

We also want to cover new letters.

Let me try to think of words that end with N and have A.

For example:
- Words with A in the first position: e.g., ""A__ N"", but the 4th is N, so the word pattern: A _ _ N _ 
- Or A in the second: _ A _ N _
- Or A in the fifth: _ _ _ N A

But note: we have to avoid C, R, E.

Let's list some words:

Option 1: A in the first position: e.g., ""ADMIN"" -> but has M and D, and I. But we don't know about these letters. Also, the 4th is N? ADMIN: A D M I N -> positions: 1:A, 2:D, 3:M, 4:I, 5:N -> wait, that doesn't have N at 4th? Actually, the 4th is I and 5th is N. So not.

We need the 4th letter to be N. So the word must be: _ _ _ N _

So, for A in first: A _ _ N _
For example: ""ALIGN"" -> A L I G N -> but 4th is G? No, positions: 1:A, 2:L, 3:I, 4:G, 5:N -> not N at 4th.

We need the 4th letter to be N, so the word pattern: ?1 ?2 ?3 N ?5

So, for A in first: A ?2 ?3 N ?5
For example: ""ASIAN"" -> A S I A N -> but that has two A's? And positions: 1:A, 2:S, 3:I, 4:A, 5:N -> 4th is A, not N. So no.

Another: ""AVIAN"" -> A V I A N -> 1:A, 2:V, 3:I, 4:A, 5:N -> again 4th is A.

We need the 4th to be N. So the word must have the 4th letter as N.

Examples of words with 4th letter N:
- ...N. -> like ""URBAN"", ""TRAIN"", but we cannot use R (and TRAIN has R and we know R is not in the word). Also, URBAN has R and U, but R is out.

Without R and E and C.

Let me think: 
- ""PLAIN"" -> P L A I N -> but here A is in the 3rd position? We know A cannot be in 3rd because in the first guess A was in 3rd and got a dash (meaning it's in the word but not in 3rd). So in PLAIN, if we put A in 3rd, that would be the same position? But we are allowed to use A again? But the feedback said A is in the word but not in 3rd, so we should avoid putting A in 3rd again because we know it's not there.

But in PLAIN, the pattern is: P L A I N -> so 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:I, 5:N -> but we need 4th to be N? Here 4th is I and 5th is N. So not.

We need the 4th to be N. So the word must be: ?1 ?2 ?3 N ?5

So, for example: 
- ""BEGAN"" -> B E G A N -> but E is out (we know E is not in the word) and also 4th is A? 1:B, 2:E, 3:G, 4:A, 5:N -> 4th is A, not N.

Another: ""BEGIN"" -> B E G I N -> E is out.

""LOGIN"" -> L O G I N -> 4th is I, 5th is N -> not 4th as N.

We need the 4th letter to be N. So the word must have the structure: ...N? meaning the fourth letter is N and then the fifth is something.

Examples: 
- ""FJORD"" -> but has R and we know R is out.
- ""DEMON"" -> D E M O N -> E is out.

Without E and R and C.

How about: ""SAUNA"" -> S A U N A -> 1:S, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:A -> yes! 4th is N. And A is in 2nd and 5th, not 3rd. Also, no C, R, E.

But is SAUNA a valid word? Yes, it is.

But we have two A's? That's okay.

But we also have S and U to test.

Another word: ""MANGA"" -> M A N G A -> but 3rd is N? 1:M, 2:A, 3:N, 4:G, 5:A -> 4th is G, not N.

""PIANO"" -> P I A N O -> 1:P, 2:I, 3:A, 4:N, 5:O -> 4th is N! And A is in 3rd? But we know A cannot be in 3rd? Because in the first guess, A was in 3rd and got a dash. So if we put A in 3rd again, it would be wrong. But in PIANO, A is in 3rd, which we know is incorrect. So we should avoid that.

We need a word that has A not in 3rd and 4th is N.

So, back to ""SAUNA"": 
- Positions: 1:S, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:A -> A is in 2nd and 5th, not 3rd. So that's okay.

But we have two A's? The feedback only told us that A is in the word (at least one), but it might have more? So that's possible.

Another word: ""TAWNY"" -> T A W N Y -> 1:T, 2:A, 3:W, 4:N, 5:Y -> 4th is N, and A in 2nd. And no C, R, E.

But we don't know if Y is in the word? But that's okay.

""DAUNT"" -> D A U N T -> 1:D, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:T -> 4th is N, A in 2nd.

""VAUNT"" -> V A U N T -> same.

But we haven't tested many new letters.

We also want to cover more vowels? We have A already, but we don't know about I, O, U.

In SAUNA, we test S, A, U, N, A. But we already know N is in the 4th and correct, and A is in the word. So we are testing S and U.

In TAWNY, we test T, A, W, N, Y.

We might also consider words that put A in the 5th position? For example: _ _ _ N A

Like ""PIZZA"" -> but has Z and Z, and 4th is Z? 1:P, 2:I, 3:Z, 4:Z, 5:A -> not N at 4th.

""JUMNA"" -> not a word.

""TUNNA"" -> not common.

""DUNA"" -> not 5 letters.

So, let's go with ""TAWNY"" or ""SAUNA"". 

But note: in SAUNA, the 5th letter is A, which we already know is in the word. So if we get a dash for the 5th A, we know it's because it's in the word but not there? But we don't know if there is a second A. It might be redundant.

Similarly, in TAWNY, we have Y which is less common.

Another word: ""PLAIN"" is not because 4th is not N.

""TRAIN"" has R which is out.

How about ""SHINY"" -> S H I N Y -> 1:S, 2:H, 3:I, 4:N, 5:Y -> 4th is N? But we need to include A? We know A is in the word, so we must include A in the guess? Because if we don't, we might miss information about A.

Important: We know A is in the word, so we should try to find its position. Therefore, our next guess must include A (but not in the 3rd position) and have N in the 4th.

So, we cannot avoid including A.

Therefore, let's choose a word that has A and N (at 4th) and three new letters.

Options:
- ""SAUNA"": tests S, A, U, N, A -> but A is repeated. We test S and U. The 5th A might be redundant.
- ""TAWNY"": tests T, A, W, N, Y -> new letters: T, W, Y.
- ""DAUNT"": tests D, A, U, N, T -> new letters: D, U, T.

""FAUNA"": F A U N A -> similar to SAUNA.

""LAUAN"": not common.

""MAUNA"": not common.

""PAWNS"": P A W N S -> 1:P, 2:A, 3:W, 4:N, 5:S -> 4th is N? Yes. And A in 2nd. New letters: P, W, S.

But we already tried S? In the first guess we didn't use S. First guess was CRANE: C, R, A, N, E. So S is new.

But in PAWNS, the 4th is N? Let's check: P-A-W-N-S -> positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:W, 4:N, 5:S -> yes, 4th is N.

And A is in 2nd, not 3rd.

Also, no C, R, E.

So, PAWNS: P, A, W, N, S.

We test P, W, S, and we already know A and N (N is fixed).

But note: we are testing A in the 2nd position.

Similarly, we could do ""MAWNS"" or ""DAWNS"", but DAWNS has D and S.

But PAWNS is a valid word.

Another option: ""GAUNT"": G A U N T -> 1:G, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:T -> 4th is N? Actually, 4th is N? G-A-U-N-T -> 1:G, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:T -> yes.

And A in 2nd.

But we have U and T.

I think PAWNS or GAUNT are good.

But let's choose one that has more common letters.

Common consonants: S, T, L, N, etc. We have N already.

We haven't tried S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.

In PAWNS, we test P, A, W, N, S -> W is less common? But we need to test.

In GAUNT, we test G, A, U, N, T -> U is a vowel, which might be useful.

But we know the word has A, and we don't know about other vowels.

Another word: ""PLANK"" -> P L A N K -> 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:K -> but A is in 3rd, which we know is incorrect. So avoid.

""THANK"" -> T H A N K -> 1:T, 2:H, 3:A, 4:N, 5:K -> again A in 3rd, avoid.

""STAIN"" -> S T A I N -> 1:S, 2:T, 3:A, 4:I, 5:N -> 4th is I, not N. So no.

We must have 4th as N.

So, let's go with ""PAWNS"". It tests P, A, W, N, S.

But note: the word PAWNS has S at the end, which is common.

Alternatively, ""TAWNY"" tests T, A, W, N, Y.

I think PAWNS is better because S is more common than Y.

But we can also consider ""SANDY"" -> but 4th is D? S A N D Y -> 1:S, 2:A, 3:N, 4:D, 5:Y -> 3rd is N, not 4th. So no.

""BANDY"" -> B A N D Y -> 3rd is N? 1:B, 2:A, 3:N, 4:D, 5:Y -> not 4th as N.

So, I think ""PAWNS"" is a good choice.

But let me confirm: the word is PAWNS, meaning to take something in a greedy way? Or the plural of pawn? It's a valid word.

Another common word: ""PLANT"" -> but 4th is N? P L A N T -> 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:T -> 4th is N? Actually, 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:T -> yes, 4th is N. But A is in 3rd? We know A cannot be in 3rd. So avoid.

Similarly, ""SLANT"" -> same issue.

So, we need to avoid A in 3rd.

Therefore, I choose ""PAWNS"".

But in PAWNS, the A is in 2nd, which is good.

So, my next guess: PAWNS.

But note: we are not forced to put N in the 4th? Actually, we know that N is in the 4th position, so we can keep it there to get more information about other positions.

If we don't put N in the 4th, we might not learn about the other positions? But we know it's fixed, so we can use that to our advantage.

So, I'll go with PAWNS.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, R, and E are not in the word (x).
- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position (-).
- N is in the word and correctly placed in the 4th position (✓).

Key insights:
- The secret word has N as the 4th letter.
- A is present but not in the 3rd position (so it must be in position 1, 2, or 5).
- The word does not contain C, R, or E.
- For the next guess, we should:
  - Retain N in the 4th position to confirm it (though it's already confirmed, this helps test other letters).
  - Include A in a new position (1, 2, or 5) to narrow down its location.
  - Avoid C, R, and E entirely.
  - Test new common letters (e.g., S, T, P, L, D) to gather more information.

After evaluating possible words, ""PAWNS"" is a strong choice because:
- It places A in the 2nd position (a new spot to test).
- It keeps N in the 4th position.
- It tests new common letters: P, W, and S.
- It avoids C, R, E and does not repeat the 3rd-position A error.
- ""PAWNS"" is a valid 5-letter English word (meaning to gamble or pledge).

This guess will provide feedback on:
- Whether A is in the 2nd position (✓ or -).
- Whether P, W, or S are in the word and their positions.",Guess 2: PAWNS -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) W(x) N(✓) S(x),FAIL

 A good starting word should have repeating letters? But 5-letter with no repeats? 
 Actually, it's often better to have a word with common letters and distinct to cover more ground.
 Let me pick a word that has letters that are frequently used in English: e.g., vowels: A, E, I and common consonants: R, S, T, N.
 One of the popular starting words is ""SLATE"" because it has S, L, A, T, E -> which are common and it covers two vowels (A and E) and three common consonants.

 However, note: We don't know the word list? But we are allowed to guess any valid English word. I'll go with ""SLATE"".

 But note: the problem says ""valid 5-letter English word"", so I have to choose a word that I know is valid.

 Alternative: ""CRANE"" is also a common starter? It has C, R, A, N, E -> two vowels (A and E) and three consonants.

 Actually, let me choose ""ROATE"". Wait, is that common? Maybe not. 

 Actually, I recall that ""STARE"" is a good starter? It has S, T, A, R, E -> two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants.

 But to maximize distinct letters and common ones, I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E. 

 However, I can also choose ""SLATE"" or ""TRACE"". 

 I think I'll pick ""CRATE"" because it covers C, R, A, T, E -> which includes common consonants and two vowels (A and E). 

 Wait, let me decide: 

 Option 1: SLATE -> letters: S, L, A, T, E
 Option 2: CRANE -> C, R, A, N, E
 Option 3: TRACE -> T, R, A, C, E -> same as CRATE? Actually CRATE: C,R,A,T,E

 Actually, to have a good coverage, I will choose ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".For the first guess, I need a word that maximizes information by including common vowels and consonants. Letters like R, S, T, L, N, E, and A provide broad coverage. ""CRANE"" includes C, R, A, N, E—common letters with minimal repetition. This will give solid feedback on frequent consonants and vowels while leaving room for adjustments in subsequent guesses.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: ✓ (correct position, so the word has N as the 4th letter)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
1. The 4th letter is N.
2. The letter A is in the word, but not in the 3rd position (since it was in the 3rd in CRANE and got a dash).
3. The letters C, R, and E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Must have an A somewhere (but not in position 3) and must have N in position 4.

Also, we know the word does not contain C, R, or E.

Now, for the next guess, we want to try to find the positions of A and also cover other common letters that haven't been tried yet.

We have used: C, R, A, N, E. So we should avoid these except A and N (which we know are in the word). But note: R and E are out, so we cannot use them.

Available letters: We can use any letters except C, R, E. Also, we know A is in the word but not in position 3, and N is fixed at position 4.

We must form a 5-letter word that has:
- The 4th letter as N (because we know it's correct and in place).
- The letter A must appear, but not in the 3rd position.

Also, we want to test other common letters to get more information.

Common consonants we haven't tried: S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.

We can try to put A in a different position (like 1st or 2nd or 5th) and also test other vowels? But note, we have only one vowel so far (A) and we know E is out. So other vowels: I, O, U? But we don't know if they are present.

Let's think of words that have:
- 4th letter is N
- Include A (but not in 3rd position)
- Do not include C, R, E

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, or 5.

We also want to cover new letters.

Let me try to think of words that end with N and have A.

For example:
- Words with A in the first position: e.g., ""A__ N"", but the 4th is N, so the word pattern: A _ _ N _ 
- Or A in the second: _ A _ N _
- Or A in the fifth: _ _ _ N A

But note: we have to avoid C, R, E.

Let's list some words:

Option 1: A in the first position: e.g., ""ADMIN"" -> but has M and D, and I. But we don't know about these letters. Also, the 4th is N? ADMIN: A D M I N -> positions: 1:A, 2:D, 3:M, 4:I, 5:N -> wait, that doesn't have N at 4th? Actually, the 4th is I and 5th is N. So not.

We need the 4th letter to be N. So the word must be: _ _ _ N _

So, for A in first: A _ _ N _
For example: ""ALIGN"" -> A L I G N -> but 4th is G? No, positions: 1:A, 2:L, 3:I, 4:G, 5:N -> not N at 4th.

We need the 4th letter to be N, so the word pattern: ?1 ?2 ?3 N ?5

So, for A in first: A ?2 ?3 N ?5
For example: ""ASIAN"" -> A S I A N -> but that has two A's? And positions: 1:A, 2:S, 3:I, 4:A, 5:N -> 4th is A, not N. So no.

Another: ""AVIAN"" -> A V I A N -> 1:A, 2:V, 3:I, 4:A, 5:N -> again 4th is A.

We need the 4th to be N. So the word must have the 4th letter as N.

Examples of words with 4th letter N:
- ...N. -> like ""URBAN"", ""TRAIN"", but we cannot use R (and TRAIN has R and we know R is not in the word). Also, URBAN has R and U, but R is out.

Without R and E and C.

Let me think: 
- ""PLAIN"" -> P L A I N -> but here A is in the 3rd position? We know A cannot be in 3rd because in the first guess A was in 3rd and got a dash (meaning it's in the word but not in 3rd). So in PLAIN, if we put A in 3rd, that would be the same position? But we are allowed to use A again? But the feedback said A is in the word but not in 3rd, so we should avoid putting A in 3rd again because we know it's not there.

But in PLAIN, the pattern is: P L A I N -> so 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:I, 5:N -> but we need 4th to be N? Here 4th is I and 5th is N. So not.

We need the 4th to be N. So the word must be: ?1 ?2 ?3 N ?5

So, for example: 
- ""BEGAN"" -> B E G A N -> but E is out (we know E is not in the word) and also 4th is A? 1:B, 2:E, 3:G, 4:A, 5:N -> 4th is A, not N.

Another: ""BEGIN"" -> B E G I N -> E is out.

""LOGIN"" -> L O G I N -> 4th is I, 5th is N -> not 4th as N.

We need the 4th letter to be N. So the word must have the structure: ...N? meaning the fourth letter is N and then the fifth is something.

Examples: 
- ""FJORD"" -> but has R and we know R is out.
- ""DEMON"" -> D E M O N -> E is out.

Without E and R and C.

How about: ""SAUNA"" -> S A U N A -> 1:S, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:A -> yes! 4th is N. And A is in 2nd and 5th, not 3rd. Also, no C, R, E.

But is SAUNA a valid word? Yes, it is.

But we have two A's? That's okay.

But we also have S and U to test.

Another word: ""MANGA"" -> M A N G A -> but 3rd is N? 1:M, 2:A, 3:N, 4:G, 5:A -> 4th is G, not N.

""PIANO"" -> P I A N O -> 1:P, 2:I, 3:A, 4:N, 5:O -> 4th is N! And A is in 3rd? But we know A cannot be in 3rd? Because in the first guess, A was in 3rd and got a dash. So if we put A in 3rd again, it would be wrong. But in PIANO, A is in 3rd, which we know is incorrect. So we should avoid that.

We need a word that has A not in 3rd and 4th is N.

So, back to ""SAUNA"": 
- Positions: 1:S, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:A -> A is in 2nd and 5th, not 3rd. So that's okay.

But we have two A's? The feedback only told us that A is in the word (at least one), but it might have more? So that's possible.

Another word: ""TAWNY"" -> T A W N Y -> 1:T, 2:A, 3:W, 4:N, 5:Y -> 4th is N, and A in 2nd. And no C, R, E.

But we don't know if Y is in the word? But that's okay.

""DAUNT"" -> D A U N T -> 1:D, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:T -> 4th is N, A in 2nd.

""VAUNT"" -> V A U N T -> same.

But we haven't tested many new letters.

We also want to cover more vowels? We have A already, but we don't know about I, O, U.

In SAUNA, we test S, A, U, N, A. But we already know N is in the 4th and correct, and A is in the word. So we are testing S and U.

In TAWNY, we test T, A, W, N, Y.

We might also consider words that put A in the 5th position? For example: _ _ _ N A

Like ""PIZZA"" -> but has Z and Z, and 4th is Z? 1:P, 2:I, 3:Z, 4:Z, 5:A -> not N at 4th.

""JUMNA"" -> not a word.

""TUNNA"" -> not common.

""DUNA"" -> not 5 letters.

So, let's go with ""TAWNY"" or ""SAUNA"". 

But note: in SAUNA, the 5th letter is A, which we already know is in the word. So if we get a dash for the 5th A, we know it's because it's in the word but not there? But we don't know if there is a second A. It might be redundant.

Similarly, in TAWNY, we have Y which is less common.

Another word: ""PLAIN"" is not because 4th is not N.

""TRAIN"" has R which is out.

How about ""SHINY"" -> S H I N Y -> 1:S, 2:H, 3:I, 4:N, 5:Y -> 4th is N? But we need to include A? We know A is in the word, so we must include A in the guess? Because if we don't, we might miss information about A.

Important: We know A is in the word, so we should try to find its position. Therefore, our next guess must include A (but not in the 3rd position) and have N in the 4th.

So, we cannot avoid including A.

Therefore, let's choose a word that has A and N (at 4th) and three new letters.

Options:
- ""SAUNA"": tests S, A, U, N, A -> but A is repeated. We test S and U. The 5th A might be redundant.
- ""TAWNY"": tests T, A, W, N, Y -> new letters: T, W, Y.
- ""DAUNT"": tests D, A, U, N, T -> new letters: D, U, T.

""FAUNA"": F A U N A -> similar to SAUNA.

""LAUAN"": not common.

""MAUNA"": not common.

""PAWNS"": P A W N S -> 1:P, 2:A, 3:W, 4:N, 5:S -> 4th is N? Yes. And A in 2nd. New letters: P, W, S.

But we already tried S? In the first guess we didn't use S. First guess was CRANE: C, R, A, N, E. So S is new.

But in PAWNS, the 4th is N? Let's check: P-A-W-N-S -> positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:W, 4:N, 5:S -> yes, 4th is N.

And A is in 2nd, not 3rd.

Also, no C, R, E.

So, PAWNS: P, A, W, N, S.

We test P, W, S, and we already know A and N (N is fixed).

But note: we are testing A in the 2nd position.

Similarly, we could do ""MAWNS"" or ""DAWNS"", but DAWNS has D and S.

But PAWNS is a valid word.

Another option: ""GAUNT"": G A U N T -> 1:G, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:T -> 4th is N? Actually, 4th is N? G-A-U-N-T -> 1:G, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:T -> yes.

And A in 2nd.

But we have U and T.

I think PAWNS or GAUNT are good.

But let's choose one that has more common letters.

Common consonants: S, T, L, N, etc. We have N already.

We haven't tried S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.

In PAWNS, we test P, A, W, N, S -> W is less common? But we need to test.

In GAUNT, we test G, A, U, N, T -> U is a vowel, which might be useful.

But we know the word has A, and we don't know about other vowels.

Another word: ""PLANK"" -> P L A N K -> 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:K -> but A is in 3rd, which we know is incorrect. So avoid.

""THANK"" -> T H A N K -> 1:T, 2:H, 3:A, 4:N, 5:K -> again A in 3rd, avoid.

""STAIN"" -> S T A I N -> 1:S, 2:T, 3:A, 4:I, 5:N -> 4th is I, not N. So no.

We must have 4th as N.

So, let's go with ""PAWNS"". It tests P, A, W, N, S.

But note: the word PAWNS has S at the end, which is common.

Alternatively, ""TAWNY"" tests T, A, W, N, Y.

I think PAWNS is better because S is more common than Y.

But we can also consider ""SANDY"" -> but 4th is D? S A N D Y -> 1:S, 2:A, 3:N, 4:D, 5:Y -> 3rd is N, not 4th. So no.

""BANDY"" -> B A N D Y -> 3rd is N? 1:B, 2:A, 3:N, 4:D, 5:Y -> not 4th as N.

So, I think ""PAWNS"" is a good choice.

But let me confirm: the word is PAWNS, meaning to take something in a greedy way? Or the plural of pawn? It's a valid word.

Another common word: ""PLANT"" -> but 4th is N? P L A N T -> 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:T -> 4th is N? Actually, 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:T -> yes, 4th is N. But A is in 3rd? We know A cannot be in 3rd. So avoid.

Similarly, ""SLANT"" -> same issue.

So, we need to avoid A in 3rd.

Therefore, I choose ""PAWNS"".

But in PAWNS, the A is in 2nd, which is good.

So, my next guess: PAWNS.

But note: we are not forced to put N in the 4th? Actually, we know that N is in the 4th position, so we can keep it there to get more information about other positions.

If we don't put N in the 4th, we might not learn about the other positions? But we know it's fixed, so we can use that to our advantage.

So, I'll go with PAWNS.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, R, and E are not in the word (x).
- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position (-).
- N is in the word and correctly placed in the 4th position (✓).

Key insights:
- The secret word has N as the 4th letter.
- A is present but not in the 3rd position (so it must be in position 1, 2, or 5).
- The word does not contain C, R, or E.
- For the next guess, we should:
  - Retain N in the 4th position to confirm it (though it's already confirmed, this helps test other letters).
  - Include A in a new position (1, 2, or 5) to narrow down its location.
  - Avoid C, R, and E entirely.
  - Test new common letters (e.g., S, T, P, L, D) to gather more information.

After evaluating possible words, ""PAWNS"" is a strong choice because:
- It places A in the 2nd position (a new spot to test).
- It keeps N in the 4th position.
- It tests new common letters: P, W, and S.
- It avoids C, R, E and does not repeat the 3rd-position A error.
- ""PAWNS"" is a valid 5-letter English word (meaning to gamble or pledge).

This guess will provide feedback on:
- Whether A is in the 2nd position (✓ or -).
- Whether P, W, or S are in the word and their positions.

The 4th letter is N.\n2. The letter A is in the word, but not in the 3rd position (since it was in the 3rd in CRANE and got a dash).\n3. The letters C, R, and E are not in the word at all.\n\nTherefore, the secret word has:\n- Must have an A somewhere (but not in position 3) and must have N in position 4.\n\nAlso, we know the word does not contain C, R, or E.\n\nNow, for the next guess, we want to try to find the positions of A and also cover other common letters that haven\'t been tried yet.\n\nWe have used: C, R, A, N, E. So we should avoid these except A and N (which we know are in the word). But note: R and E are out, so we cannot use them.\n\nAvailable letters: We can use any letters except C, R, E.

But note, we have only one vowel so far (A) and we know E is out. So other vowels: I, O, U? But we don\'t know if they are present.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have:\n- 4th letter is N\n- Include A (but not in 3rd position)\n- Do not include C, R, E\n\nPossible positions for A: 1, 2, or 5.\n\nWe also want to cover new letters.\n\nLet me try to think of words that end with N and have A.\n\nFor example:\n- Words with A in the first position: e.g., ""A__ N"", but the 4th is N, so the word pattern: A _ _ N _ \n- Or A in the second: _ A _ N _\n- Or A in the fifth: _ _ _ N A\n\nBut note: we have to avoid C, R, E.\n\nLet\'s list some words:\n\nOption 1: A in the first position: e.g., ""ADMIN"" -> but has M and D, and I. But we don\'t know about these letters. Also, the 4th is N? ADMIN: A D M I N -> positions: 1:A, 2:D, 3:M, 4:I, 5:N -> wait, that doesn\'t have N at 4th? Actually, the 4th is I and 5th is N. So not.\n\nWe need the 4th letter to be N. So the word must be: _ _ _ N _\n\nSo, for A in first: A _ _ N _\nFor example: ""ALIGN"" -> A L I G N -> but 4th is G? No, positions: 1:A, 2:L, 3:I, 4:G, 5:N -> not N at 4th.\n\nWe need the 4th letter to be N, so the word pattern: ?1 ?2 ?3 N ?5\n\nSo, for A in first: A ?2 ?3 N ?5\nFor example: ""ASIAN"" -> A S I A N -> but that has two A\'s? And positions: 1:A, 2:S, 3:I, 4:A, 5:N -> 4th is A, not N. So no.\n\nAnother: ""AVIAN"" -> A V I A N -> 1:A, 2:V, 3:I, 4:A, 5:N -> again 4th is A.\n\nWe need the 4th to be N. So the word must have the 4th letter as N.\n\nExamples of words with 4th letter N:\n- ...N. -> like ""URBAN"", ""TRAIN"", but we cannot use R (and TRAIN has R and we know R is not in the word). Also, URBAN has R and U, but R is out.\n\nWithout R and E and C.\n\nLet me think: \n- ""PLAIN"" -> P L A I N -> but here A is in the 3rd position? We know A cannot be in 3rd because in the first guess A was in 3rd and got a dash (meaning it\'s in the word but not in 3rd). So in PLAIN, if we put A in 3rd, that would be the same position? But we are allowed to use A again? But the feedback said A is in the word but not in 3rd, so we should avoid putting A in 3rd again because we know it\'s not there.\n\nBut in PLAIN, the pattern is: P L A I N -> so 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:I, 5:N -> but we need 4th to be N? Here 4th is I and 5th is N. So not.\n\nWe need the 4th to be N.

So the word must have the structure: ...N? meaning the fourth letter is N and then the fifth is something.\n\nExamples: \n- ""FJORD"" -> but has R and we know R is out.\n- ""DEMON"" -> D E M O N -> E is out.\n\nWithout E and R and C.\n\nHow about: ""SAUNA"" -> S A U N A -> 1:S, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:A -> yes! 4th is N. And A is in 2nd and 5th, not 3rd. Also, no C, R, E.\n\nBut is SAUNA a valid word? Yes, it is.\n\nBut we have two A\'s? That\'s okay.\n\nBut we also have S and U to test.\n\nAnother word: ""MANGA"" -> M A N G A -> but 3rd is N? 1:M, 2:A, 3:N, 4:G, 5:A -> 4th is G, not N.\n\n""PIANO"" -> P I A N O -> 1:P, 2:I, 3:A, 4:N, 5:O -> 4th is N! And A is in 3rd? But we know A cannot be in 3rd? Because in the first guess, A was in 3rd and got a dash. So if we put A in 3rd again, it would be wrong. But in PIANO, A is in 3rd, which we know is incorrect. So we should avoid that.\n\nWe need a word that has A not in 3rd and 4th is N.\n\nSo, back to ""SAUNA"": \n- Positions: 1:S, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:A -> A is in 2nd and 5th, not 3rd. So that\'s okay.\n\nBut we have two A\'s? The feedback only told us that A is in the word (at least one), but it might have more? So that\'s possible.\n\nAnother word: ""TAWNY"" -> T A W N Y -> 1:T, 2:A, 3:W, 4:N, 5:Y -> 4th is N, and A in 2nd. And no C, R, E.\n\nBut we don\'t know if Y is in the word? But that\'s okay.\n\n""DAUNT"" -> D A U N T -> 1:D, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:T -> 4th is N, A in 2nd.\n\n""VAUNT"" -> V A U N T -> same.\n\nBut we haven\'t tested many new letters.\n\nWe also want to cover more vowels? We have A already, but we don\'t know about I, O, U.\n\nIn SAUNA, we test S, A, U, N, A. But we already know N is in the 4th and correct, and A is in the word. So we are testing S and U.\n\nIn TAWNY, we test T, A, W, N, Y.\n\nWe might also consider words that put A in the 5th position? For example: _ _ _ N A\n\nLike ""PIZZA"" -> but has Z and Z, and 4th is Z? 1:P, 2:I, 3:Z, 4:Z, 5:A -> not N at 4th.\n\n""JUMNA"" -> not a word.\n\n""TUNNA"" -> not common.\n\n""DUNA"" -> not 5 letters.\n\nSo, let\'s go with ""TAWNY"" or ""SAUNA"". \n\nBut note: in SAUNA, the 5th letter is A, which we already know is in the word. So if we get a dash for the 5th A, we know it\'s because it\'s in the word but not there? But we don\'t know if there is a second A. It might be redundant.\n\nSimilarly, in TAWNY, we have Y which is less common.\n\nAnother word: ""PLAIN"" is not because 4th is not N.\n\n""TRAIN"" has R which is out.\n\nHow about ""SHINY"" -> S H I N Y -> 1:S, 2:H, 3:I, 4:N, 5:Y -> 4th is N?

- P: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct, in position 2)  [Note: In PAWNS, A is the second letter, so now we know A is in position 2]
- W: x (not in the word)
- N: ✓ (correct, in position 4) [We already knew this]
- S: x (not in the word)

So, from the feedback, we now know:
- The second letter is A (from PAWNS: A is ✓ in position 2).
- The fourth letter is N (from both guesses).
- The word does not contain: C, R, E, P, W, S.

Also, from the first guess, we knew A was not in position 3, but now we know it is in position 2.

Therefore, the current known information:
- Position 2: A
- Position 4: N
- Forbidden letters: C, R, E, P, W, S

We need to form a 5-letter word that has:
- Second letter: A
- Fourth letter: N
- Does not contain: C, R, E, P, W, S

We also need to guess the first, third, and fifth letters.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, P, W, S. So we should avoid these except A and N which are in the word.

Available letters: We can use any letter except the forbidden ones. Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z.

But we need to form a valid English word.

The pattern is: _ A _ N _

We need to fill the first, third, and fifth positions.

We also know that the word must have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, but it might. We have A already, which is a vowel. Other vowels: I, O, U (E is out).

Let's think of common words that fit the pattern _ A _ N _

Examples:
- ""BANDY"" -> but S is out? B A N D Y -> but we need fourth letter to be N? In ""BANDY"": positions: 1:B, 2:A, 3:N, 4:D, 5:Y -> but we need position 4 to be N, here it's D. So no.
- ""MANGO"" -> M A N G O -> 1:M, 2:A, 3:N, 4:G, 5:O -> position 4 is G, not N.
- ""TANGY"" -> T A N G Y -> 1:T, 2:A, 3:N, 4:G, 5:Y -> position 4 is G, not N.

We need the fourth letter to be N, so the third letter can be anything but must not be a position that conflicts.

The pattern is: first letter, then A (2nd), then some letter (3rd), then N (4th), then some letter (5th).

So, words like:
- ""DAUNT"" -> D A U N T -> 1:D, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:T -> this fits the pattern. And D, U, T are not forbidden? Forbidden: C,R,E,P,W,S. So D, U, T are allowed.
- ""FAUNA"" -> F A U N A -> 1:F, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:A -> but A is repeated? But we know A is in the word, and we have it in position 2, so having another A is possible. But in this case, the fifth letter is A. Also, F and U are allowed.
- ""GAUNT"" -> G A U N T -> same as DAUNT but with G.
- ""HAUNT"" -> H A U N T -> H, A, U, N, T.
- ""JAUNT"" -> J A U N T -> J is less common.
- ""VAUNT"" -> V A U N T -> V is allowed.

But note: in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was wrong, but now we are not putting A in position 3, so it's okay.

We also have words like:
- ""LATIN"" -> L A T I N -> 1:L, 2:A, 3:T, 4:I, 5:N -> but position 4 is I, not N. So no.
- ""RABIN"" -> but R is forbidden.

Another set: words ending with ""AND"" but we need the fourth to be N, so not.

Or words like ""PLAIN"" but P is forbidden and position 4 is not N.

So, the candidates are: DAUNT, FAUNA, GAUNT, HAUNT, JAUNT, VAUNT, etc.

But we also have to consider that we don't know if there are duplicate letters. But that's okay.

Now, we want to test as many new letters as possible to get information.

We have not used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z.

Common letters: T, L, D, M, O, U, etc.

In the words above, DAUNT, FAUNA, GAUNT, HAUNT, VAUNT all have U and T (except FAUNA has A again).

FAUNA has F and U, but the fifth letter is A, which we already know. So it might not give new information about another letter.

Similarly, DAUNT has D, U, T.

We could choose a word that has a vowel in the fifth position to test for vowels? We know E is out, so other vowels are I, O, U.

U is in many of these words.

Another word: ""MANGY"" -> M A N G Y -> but position 4 is G? No.

""BALDY"" -> B A L D Y -> position 4 is D, not N.

We need to stick to the pattern.

Another possibility: ""TAINT"" -> T A I N T -> 1:T, 2:A, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T -> this fits: position 4 is N? 1:T, 2:A, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T -> yes! And T is not forbidden? T is not in the forbidden list (C,R,E,P,W,S are forbidden, T is okay).

But ""TAINT"" has two T's? That's possible.

Also, it tests T and I.

But we have to avoid S, which we are.

Similarly, ""PAINT"" but P is forbidden.

""SAINT"" has S, forbidden.

""FAINT"" -> F A I N T -> 1:F, 2:A, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T -> this also fits, and F, I, T are new.

Similarly, ""GAIN"" is 4 letters.

""RAINY"" has R, forbidden.

So, options: DAUNT (D,A,U,N,T), FAUNA (F,A,U,N,A), FAINT (F,A,I,N,T), TAINT (T,A,I,N,T), etc.

Now, to maximize information, we might avoid repeating letters if possible. FAUNA has two A's, which might not be efficient. TAINT has two T's.

FAINT has all distinct except we know A and N are already in, but F, I, T are new and distinct.

Similarly, DAUNT has D, U, T, all new and distinct (A and N known).

But in DAUNT, the fifth letter is T, which is a consonant. We might want to test a vowel in the fifth position? But not necessary.

We could also consider ""HAVIN"" but not a word, or ""BAKIN"" not standard.

""MAINS"" has S, forbidden.

Another word: ""LAVIN"" not common.

I think FAINT is a good choice: it tests F, I, and T, and has the pattern with A in 2nd and N in 4th.

Similarly, ""JOINT"" but J is less common and O? J A O N T? No, pattern: J A ? N T, but third letter must be O? ""JOINT"" is J O I N T -> not A in second.

We need A in second.

So, back to FAINT: F A I N T.

This will tell us about F, I, and T.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Similarly, we could do ""DAINT"" but not a common word? ""DAINT"" is not standard, usually ""dainty"" but that's 6 letters.

So, FAINT is valid.

Another option: ""GAUNT"" is valid, but it has U instead of I.

We don't know if the word has I or U or O.

To cover more vowels, I might choose FAINT to test I.

But let's see the frequency.

We could also choose a word with O, like ""OCTAN"" but O C T A N -> C is forbidden, and pattern not matching.

""MANOR"" has R and not matching pattern.

I think FAINT is a solid choice.

But note: in FAINT, the fifth letter is T, which is a common consonant.

We could do ""MAINS"" but S is forbidden.

""BAILS"" has S.

So, I'll go with FAINT.

But let's confirm: F is allowed, A is known in position 2, I is new, N known in 4, T new.

Yes.

So, guess: FAINT.

Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(not in word), R(not in word), A(in word but wrong position), N(correct position), E(not in word).  
- **Guess 2: PAWNS** → Feedback: P(not in word), A(correct position), W(not in word), N(correct position), S(not in word).

### Key Insights:
- **Position 2 is A** (confirmed by Guess 2).
- **Position 4 is N** (confirmed by both guesses).
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, E, P, W, S (not in the word).
- **Pattern**: The word must follow `_ A _ N _`.
- **Remaining positions to solve**: 1st, 3rd, and 5th letters.
- **Available letters**: All letters except excluded ones (C, R, E, P, W, S). Focus on common letters like D, F, G, H, I, L, M, O, T, U, V, Y.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Test high-frequency consonants (e.g., T, L, D) and vowels (e.g., I, O, U) in positions 1, 3, and 5.
- Prioritize words with distinct new letters to maximize information.
- Avoid repeating known incorrect letters or positions (e.g., A cannot be in position 3).

Selected word: **FAINT**  
- Fits the pattern `_ A _ N _` (A in position 2, N in position 4).
- Tests new common letters: 
  - **F** in position 1 (common consonant).
  - **I** in position 3 (vowel not yet tested).
  - **T** in position 5 (high-frequency consonant).
- Avoids excluded letters and repeats.

This guess will provide feedback on F, I, and T, helping to narrow down the remaining letters and positions.

 A good starting word should have repeating letters? But 5-letter with no repeats? 
 Actually, it's often better to have a word with common letters and distinct to cover more ground.
 Let me pick a word that has letters that are frequently used in English: e.g., vowels: A, E, I and common consonants: R, S, T, N.
 One of the popular starting words is ""SLATE"" because it has S, L, A, T, E -> which are common and it covers two vowels (A and E) and three common consonants.

 However, note: We don't know the word list? But we are allowed to guess any valid English word. I'll go with ""SLATE"".

 But note: the problem says ""valid 5-letter English word"", so I have to choose a word that I know is valid.

 Alternative: ""CRANE"" is also a common starter? It has C, R, A, N, E -> two vowels (A and E) and three consonants.

 Actually, let me choose ""ROATE"". Wait, is that common? Maybe not. 

 Actually, I recall that ""STARE"" is a good starter? It has S, T, A, R, E -> two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants.

 But to maximize distinct letters and common ones, I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E. 

 However, I can also choose ""SLATE"" or ""TRACE"". 

 I think I'll pick ""CRATE"" because it covers C, R, A, T, E -> which includes common consonants and two vowels (A and E). 

 Wait, let me decide: 

 Option 1: SLATE -> letters: S, L, A, T, E
 Option 2: CRANE -> C, R, A, N, E
 Option 3: TRACE -> T, R, A, C, E -> same as CRATE? Actually CRATE: C,R,A,T,E

 Actually, to have a good coverage, I will choose ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".For the first guess, I need a word that maximizes information by including common vowels and consonants. Letters like R, S, T, L, N, E, and A provide broad coverage. ""CRANE"" includes C, R, A, N, E—common letters with minimal repetition. This will give solid feedback on frequent consonants and vowels while leaving room for adjustments in subsequent guesses.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: ✓ (correct position, so the word has N as the 4th letter)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
1. The 4th letter is N.
2. The letter A is in the word, but not in the 3rd position (since it was in the 3rd in CRANE and got a dash).
3. The letters C, R, and E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Must have an A somewhere (but not in position 3) and must have N in position 4.

Also, we know the word does not contain C, R, or E.

Now, for the next guess, we want to try to find the positions of A and also cover other common letters that haven't been tried yet.

We have used: C, R, A, N, E. So we should avoid these except A and N (which we know are in the word). But note: R and E are out, so we cannot use them.

Available letters: We can use any letters except C, R, E. Also, we know A is in the word but not in position 3, and N is fixed at position 4.

We must form a 5-letter word that has:
- The 4th letter as N (because we know it's correct and in place).
- The letter A must appear, but not in the 3rd position.

Also, we want to test other common letters to get more information.

Common consonants we haven't tried: S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.

We can try to put A in a different position (like 1st or 2nd or 5th) and also test other vowels? But note, we have only one vowel so far (A) and we know E is out. So other vowels: I, O, U? But we don't know if they are present.

Let's think of words that have:
- 4th letter is N
- Include A (but not in 3rd position)
- Do not include C, R, E

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, or 5.

We also want to cover new letters.

Let me try to think of words that end with N and have A.

For example:
- Words with A in the first position: e.g., ""A__ N"", but the 4th is N, so the word pattern: A _ _ N _ 
- Or A in the second: _ A _ N _
- Or A in the fifth: _ _ _ N A

But note: we have to avoid C, R, E.

Let's list some words:

Option 1: A in the first position: e.g., ""ADMIN"" -> but has M and D, and I. But we don't know about these letters. Also, the 4th is N? ADMIN: A D M I N -> positions: 1:A, 2:D, 3:M, 4:I, 5:N -> wait, that doesn't have N at 4th? Actually, the 4th is I and 5th is N. So not.

We need the 4th letter to be N. So the word must be: _ _ _ N _

So, for A in first: A _ _ N _
For example: ""ALIGN"" -> A L I G N -> but 4th is G? No, positions: 1:A, 2:L, 3:I, 4:G, 5:N -> not N at 4th.

We need the 4th letter to be N, so the word pattern: ?1 ?2 ?3 N ?5

So, for A in first: A ?2 ?3 N ?5
For example: ""ASIAN"" -> A S I A N -> but that has two A's? And positions: 1:A, 2:S, 3:I, 4:A, 5:N -> 4th is A, not N. So no.

Another: ""AVIAN"" -> A V I A N -> 1:A, 2:V, 3:I, 4:A, 5:N -> again 4th is A.

We need the 4th to be N. So the word must have the 4th letter as N.

Examples of words with 4th letter N:
- ...N. -> like ""URBAN"", ""TRAIN"", but we cannot use R (and TRAIN has R and we know R is not in the word). Also, URBAN has R and U, but R is out.

Without R and E and C.

Let me think: 
- ""PLAIN"" -> P L A I N -> but here A is in the 3rd position? We know A cannot be in 3rd because in the first guess A was in 3rd and got a dash (meaning it's in the word but not in 3rd). So in PLAIN, if we put A in 3rd, that would be the same position? But we are allowed to use A again? But the feedback said A is in the word but not in 3rd, so we should avoid putting A in 3rd again because we know it's not there.

But in PLAIN, the pattern is: P L A I N -> so 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:I, 5:N -> but we need 4th to be N? Here 4th is I and 5th is N. So not.

We need the 4th to be N. So the word must be: ?1 ?2 ?3 N ?5

So, for example: 
- ""BEGAN"" -> B E G A N -> but E is out (we know E is not in the word) and also 4th is A? 1:B, 2:E, 3:G, 4:A, 5:N -> 4th is A, not N.

Another: ""BEGIN"" -> B E G I N -> E is out.

""LOGIN"" -> L O G I N -> 4th is I, 5th is N -> not 4th as N.

We need the 4th letter to be N. So the word must have the structure: ...N? meaning the fourth letter is N and then the fifth is something.

Examples: 
- ""FJORD"" -> but has R and we know R is out.
- ""DEMON"" -> D E M O N -> E is out.

Without E and R and C.

How about: ""SAUNA"" -> S A U N A -> 1:S, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:A -> yes! 4th is N. And A is in 2nd and 5th, not 3rd. Also, no C, R, E.

But is SAUNA a valid word? Yes, it is.

But we have two A's? That's okay.

But we also have S and U to test.

Another word: ""MANGA"" -> M A N G A -> but 3rd is N? 1:M, 2:A, 3:N, 4:G, 5:A -> 4th is G, not N.

""PIANO"" -> P I A N O -> 1:P, 2:I, 3:A, 4:N, 5:O -> 4th is N! And A is in 3rd? But we know A cannot be in 3rd? Because in the first guess, A was in 3rd and got a dash. So if we put A in 3rd again, it would be wrong. But in PIANO, A is in 3rd, which we know is incorrect. So we should avoid that.

We need a word that has A not in 3rd and 4th is N.

So, back to ""SAUNA"": 
- Positions: 1:S, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:A -> A is in 2nd and 5th, not 3rd. So that's okay.

But we have two A's? The feedback only told us that A is in the word (at least one), but it might have more? So that's possible.

Another word: ""TAWNY"" -> T A W N Y -> 1:T, 2:A, 3:W, 4:N, 5:Y -> 4th is N, and A in 2nd. And no C, R, E.

But we don't know if Y is in the word? But that's okay.

""DAUNT"" -> D A U N T -> 1:D, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:T -> 4th is N, A in 2nd.

""VAUNT"" -> V A U N T -> same.

But we haven't tested many new letters.

We also want to cover more vowels? We have A already, but we don't know about I, O, U.

In SAUNA, we test S, A, U, N, A. But we already know N is in the 4th and correct, and A is in the word. So we are testing S and U.

In TAWNY, we test T, A, W, N, Y.

We might also consider words that put A in the 5th position? For example: _ _ _ N A

Like ""PIZZA"" -> but has Z and Z, and 4th is Z? 1:P, 2:I, 3:Z, 4:Z, 5:A -> not N at 4th.

""JUMNA"" -> not a word.

""TUNNA"" -> not common.

""DUNA"" -> not 5 letters.

So, let's go with ""TAWNY"" or ""SAUNA"". 

But note: in SAUNA, the 5th letter is A, which we already know is in the word. So if we get a dash for the 5th A, we know it's because it's in the word but not there? But we don't know if there is a second A. It might be redundant.

Similarly, in TAWNY, we have Y which is less common.

Another word: ""PLAIN"" is not because 4th is not N.

""TRAIN"" has R which is out.

How about ""SHINY"" -> S H I N Y -> 1:S, 2:H, 3:I, 4:N, 5:Y -> 4th is N? But we need to include A? We know A is in the word, so we must include A in the guess? Because if we don't, we might miss information about A.

Important: We know A is in the word, so we should try to find its position. Therefore, our next guess must include A (but not in the 3rd position) and have N in the 4th.

So, we cannot avoid including A.

Therefore, let's choose a word that has A and N (at 4th) and three new letters.

Options:
- ""SAUNA"": tests S, A, U, N, A -> but A is repeated. We test S and U. The 5th A might be redundant.
- ""TAWNY"": tests T, A, W, N, Y -> new letters: T, W, Y.
- ""DAUNT"": tests D, A, U, N, T -> new letters: D, U, T.

""FAUNA"": F A U N A -> similar to SAUNA.

""LAUAN"": not common.

""MAUNA"": not common.

""PAWNS"": P A W N S -> 1:P, 2:A, 3:W, 4:N, 5:S -> 4th is N? Yes. And A in 2nd. New letters: P, W, S.

But we already tried S? In the first guess we didn't use S. First guess was CRANE: C, R, A, N, E. So S is new.

But in PAWNS, the 4th is N? Let's check: P-A-W-N-S -> positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:W, 4:N, 5:S -> yes, 4th is N.

And A is in 2nd, not 3rd.

Also, no C, R, E.

So, PAWNS: P, A, W, N, S.

We test P, W, S, and we already know A and N (N is fixed).

But note: we are testing A in the 2nd position.

Similarly, we could do ""MAWNS"" or ""DAWNS"", but DAWNS has D and S.

But PAWNS is a valid word.

Another option: ""GAUNT"": G A U N T -> 1:G, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:T -> 4th is N? Actually, 4th is N? G-A-U-N-T -> 1:G, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:T -> yes.

And A in 2nd.

But we have U and T.

I think PAWNS or GAUNT are good.

But let's choose one that has more common letters.

Common consonants: S, T, L, N, etc. We have N already.

We haven't tried S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.

In PAWNS, we test P, A, W, N, S -> W is less common? But we need to test.

In GAUNT, we test G, A, U, N, T -> U is a vowel, which might be useful.

But we know the word has A, and we don't know about other vowels.

Another word: ""PLANK"" -> P L A N K -> 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:K -> but A is in 3rd, which we know is incorrect. So avoid.

""THANK"" -> T H A N K -> 1:T, 2:H, 3:A, 4:N, 5:K -> again A in 3rd, avoid.

""STAIN"" -> S T A I N -> 1:S, 2:T, 3:A, 4:I, 5:N -> 4th is I, not N. So no.

We must have 4th as N.

So, let's go with ""PAWNS"". It tests P, A, W, N, S.

But note: the word PAWNS has S at the end, which is common.

Alternatively, ""TAWNY"" tests T, A, W, N, Y.

I think PAWNS is better because S is more common than Y.

But we can also consider ""SANDY"" -> but 4th is D? S A N D Y -> 1:S, 2:A, 3:N, 4:D, 5:Y -> 3rd is N, not 4th. So no.

""BANDY"" -> B A N D Y -> 3rd is N? 1:B, 2:A, 3:N, 4:D, 5:Y -> not 4th as N.

So, I think ""PAWNS"" is a good choice.

But let me confirm: the word is PAWNS, meaning to take something in a greedy way? Or the plural of pawn? It's a valid word.

Another common word: ""PLANT"" -> but 4th is N? P L A N T -> 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:T -> 4th is N? Actually, 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:T -> yes, 4th is N. But A is in 3rd? We know A cannot be in 3rd. So avoid.

Similarly, ""SLANT"" -> same issue.

So, we need to avoid A in 3rd.

Therefore, I choose ""PAWNS"".

But in PAWNS, the A is in 2nd, which is good.

So, my next guess: PAWNS.

But note: we are not forced to put N in the 4th? Actually, we know that N is in the 4th position, so we can keep it there to get more information about other positions.

If we don't put N in the 4th, we might not learn about the other positions? But we know it's fixed, so we can use that to our advantage.

So, I'll go with PAWNS.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, R, and E are not in the word (x).
- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position (-).
- N is in the word and correctly placed in the 4th position (✓).

Key insights:
- The secret word has N as the 4th letter.
- A is present but not in the 3rd position (so it must be in position 1, 2, or 5).
- The word does not contain C, R, or E.
- For the next guess, we should:
  - Retain N in the 4th position to confirm it (though it's already confirmed, this helps test other letters).
  - Include A in a new position (1, 2, or 5) to narrow down its location.
  - Avoid C, R, and E entirely.
  - Test new common letters (e.g., S, T, P, L, D) to gather more information.

After evaluating possible words, ""PAWNS"" is a strong choice because:
- It places A in the 2nd position (a new spot to test).
- It keeps N in the 4th position.
- It tests new common letters: P, W, and S.
- It avoids C, R, E and does not repeat the 3rd-position A error.
- ""PAWNS"" is a valid 5-letter English word (meaning to gamble or pledge).

This guess will provide feedback on:
- Whether A is in the 2nd position (✓ or -).
- Whether P, W, or S are in the word and their positions.

<guess>PAWNS</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: PAWNS -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) W(x) N(✓) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
- N: ✓ (correct, in position 4)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: PAWNS
- P: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct, in position 2)  [Note: In PAWNS, A is the second letter, so now we know A is in position 2]
- W: x (not in the word)
- N: ✓ (correct, in position 4) [We already knew this]
- S: x (not in the word)

So, from the feedback, we now know:
- The second letter is A (from PAWNS: A is ✓ in position 2).
- The fourth letter is N (from both guesses).
- The word does not contain: C, R, E, P, W, S.

Also, from the first guess, we knew A was not in position 3, but now we know it is in position 2.

Therefore, the current known information:
- Position 2: A
- Position 4: N
- Forbidden letters: C, R, E, P, W, S

We need to form a 5-letter word that has:
- Second letter: A
- Fourth letter: N
- Does not contain: C, R, E, P, W, S

We also need to guess the first, third, and fifth letters.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, P, W, S. So we should avoid these except A and N which are in the word.

Available letters: We can use any letter except the forbidden ones. Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z.

But we need to form a valid English word.

The pattern is: _ A _ N _

We need to fill the first, third, and fifth positions.

We also know that the word must have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, but it might. We have A already, which is a vowel. Other vowels: I, O, U (E is out).

Let's think of common words that fit the pattern _ A _ N _

Examples:
- ""BANDY"" -> but S is out? B A N D Y -> but we need fourth letter to be N? In ""BANDY"": positions: 1:B, 2:A, 3:N, 4:D, 5:Y -> but we need position 4 to be N, here it's D. So no.
- ""MANGO"" -> M A N G O -> 1:M, 2:A, 3:N, 4:G, 5:O -> position 4 is G, not N.
- ""TANGY"" -> T A N G Y -> 1:T, 2:A, 3:N, 4:G, 5:Y -> position 4 is G, not N.

We need the fourth letter to be N, so the third letter can be anything but must not be a position that conflicts.

The pattern is: first letter, then A (2nd), then some letter (3rd), then N (4th), then some letter (5th).

So, words like:
- ""DAUNT"" -> D A U N T -> 1:D, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:T -> this fits the pattern. And D, U, T are not forbidden? Forbidden: C,R,E,P,W,S. So D, U, T are allowed.
- ""FAUNA"" -> F A U N A -> 1:F, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:A -> but A is repeated? But we know A is in the word, and we have it in position 2, so having another A is possible. But in this case, the fifth letter is A. Also, F and U are allowed.
- ""GAUNT"" -> G A U N T -> same as DAUNT but with G.
- ""HAUNT"" -> H A U N T -> H, A, U, N, T.
- ""JAUNT"" -> J A U N T -> J is less common.
- ""VAUNT"" -> V A U N T -> V is allowed.

But note: in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was wrong, but now we are not putting A in position 3, so it's okay.

We also have words like:
- ""LATIN"" -> L A T I N -> 1:L, 2:A, 3:T, 4:I, 5:N -> but position 4 is I, not N. So no.
- ""RABIN"" -> but R is forbidden.

Another set: words ending with ""AND"" but we need the fourth to be N, so not.

Or words like ""PLAIN"" but P is forbidden and position 4 is not N.

So, the candidates are: DAUNT, FAUNA, GAUNT, HAUNT, JAUNT, VAUNT, etc.

But we also have to consider that we don't know if there are duplicate letters. But that's okay.

Now, we want to test as many new letters as possible to get information.

We have not used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z.

Common letters: T, L, D, M, O, U, etc.

In the words above, DAUNT, FAUNA, GAUNT, HAUNT, VAUNT all have U and T (except FAUNA has A again).

FAUNA has F and U, but the fifth letter is A, which we already know. So it might not give new information about another letter.

Similarly, DAUNT has D, U, T.

We could choose a word that has a vowel in the fifth position to test for vowels? We know E is out, so other vowels are I, O, U.

U is in many of these words.

Another word: ""MANGY"" -> M A N G Y -> but position 4 is G? No.

""BALDY"" -> B A L D Y -> position 4 is D, not N.

We need to stick to the pattern.

Another possibility: ""TAINT"" -> T A I N T -> 1:T, 2:A, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T -> this fits: position 4 is N? 1:T, 2:A, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T -> yes! And T is not forbidden? T is not in the forbidden list (C,R,E,P,W,S are forbidden, T is okay).

But ""TAINT"" has two T's? That's possible.

Also, it tests T and I.

But we have to avoid S, which we are.

Similarly, ""PAINT"" but P is forbidden.

""SAINT"" has S, forbidden.

""FAINT"" -> F A I N T -> 1:F, 2:A, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T -> this also fits, and F, I, T are new.

Similarly, ""GAIN"" is 4 letters.

""RAINY"" has R, forbidden.

So, options: DAUNT (D,A,U,N,T), FAUNA (F,A,U,N,A), FAINT (F,A,I,N,T), TAINT (T,A,I,N,T), etc.

Now, to maximize information, we might avoid repeating letters if possible. FAUNA has two A's, which might not be efficient. TAINT has two T's.

FAINT has all distinct except we know A and N are already in, but F, I, T are new and distinct.

Similarly, DAUNT has D, U, T, all new and distinct (A and N known).

But in DAUNT, the fifth letter is T, which is a consonant. We might want to test a vowel in the fifth position? But not necessary.

We could also consider ""HAVIN"" but not a word, or ""BAKIN"" not standard.

""MAINS"" has S, forbidden.

Another word: ""LAVIN"" not common.

I think FAINT is a good choice: it tests F, I, and T, and has the pattern with A in 2nd and N in 4th.

Similarly, ""JOINT"" but J is less common and O? J A O N T? No, pattern: J A ? N T, but third letter must be O? ""JOINT"" is J O I N T -> not A in second.

We need A in second.

So, back to FAINT: F A I N T.

This will tell us about F, I, and T.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Similarly, we could do ""DAINT"" but not a common word? ""DAINT"" is not standard, usually ""dainty"" but that's 6 letters.

So, FAINT is valid.

Another option: ""GAUNT"" is valid, but it has U instead of I.

We don't know if the word has I or U or O.

To cover more vowels, I might choose FAINT to test I.

But let's see the frequency.

We could also choose a word with O, like ""OCTAN"" but O C T A N -> C is forbidden, and pattern not matching.

""MANOR"" has R and not matching pattern.

I think FAINT is a solid choice.

But note: in FAINT, the fifth letter is T, which is a common consonant.

We could do ""MAINS"" but S is forbidden.

""BAILS"" has S.

So, I'll go with FAINT.

But let's confirm: F is allowed, A is known in position 2, I is new, N known in 4, T new.

Yes.

So, guess: FAINT.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(not in word), R(not in word), A(in word but wrong position), N(correct position), E(not in word).  
- **Guess 2: PAWNS** → Feedback: P(not in word), A(correct position), W(not in word), N(correct position), S(not in word).

### Key Insights:
- **Position 2 is A** (confirmed by Guess 2).
- **Position 4 is N** (confirmed by both guesses).
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, E, P, W, S (not in the word).
- **Pattern**: The word must follow `_ A _ N _`.
- **Remaining positions to solve**: 1st, 3rd, and 5th letters.
- **Available letters**: All letters except excluded ones (C, R, E, P, W, S). Focus on common letters like D, F, G, H, I, L, M, O, T, U, V, Y.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Test high-frequency consonants (e.g., T, L, D) and vowels (e.g., I, O, U) in positions 1, 3, and 5.
- Prioritize words with distinct new letters to maximize information.
- Avoid repeating known incorrect letters or positions (e.g., A cannot be in position 3).

Selected word: **FAINT**  
- Fits the pattern `_ A _ N _` (A in position 2, N in position 4).
- Tests new common letters: 
  - **F** in position 1 (common consonant).
  - **I** in position 3 (vowel not yet tested).
  - **T** in position 5 (high-frequency consonant).
- Avoids excluded letters and repeats.

This guess will provide feedback on F, I, and T, helping to narrow down the remaining letters and positions.

But we don\'t know about these letters. Also, the 4th is N? ADMIN: A D M I N -> positions: 1:A, 2:D, 3:M, 4:I, 5:N -> wait, that doesn\'t have N at 4th? Actually, the 4th is I and 5th is N. So not.\n\nWe need the 4th letter to be N. So the word must be: _ _ _ N _\n\nSo, for A in first: A _ _ N _\nFor example: ""ALIGN"" -> A L I G N -> but 4th is G? No, positions: 1:A, 2:L, 3:I, 4:G, 5:N -> not N at 4th.\n\nWe need the 4th letter to be N, so the word pattern: ?1 ?2 ?3 N ?5\n\nSo, for A in first: A ?2 ?3 N ?5\nFor example: ""ASIAN"" -> A S I A N -> but that has two A\'s? And positions: 1:A, 2:S, 3:I, 4:A, 5:N -> 4th is A, not N. So no.\n\nAnother: ""AVIAN"" -> A V I A N -> 1:A, 2:V, 3:I, 4:A, 5:N -> again 4th is A.\n\nWe need the 4th to be N. So the word must have the 4th letter as N.\n\nExamples of words with 4th letter N:\n- ...N. -> like ""URBAN"", ""TRAIN"", but we cannot use R (and TRAIN has R and we know R is not in the word). Also, URBAN has R and U, but R is out.\n\nWithout R and E and C.\n\nLet me think: \n- ""PLAIN"" -> P L A I N -> but here A is in the 3rd position? We know A cannot be in 3rd because in the first guess A was in 3rd and got a dash (meaning it\'s in the word but not in 3rd). So in PLAIN, if we put A in 3rd, that would be the same position? But we are allowed to use A again? But the feedback said A is in the word but not in 3rd, so we should avoid putting A in 3rd again because we know it\'s not there.\n\nBut in PLAIN, the pattern is: P L A I N -> so 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:I, 5:N -> but we need 4th to be N? Here 4th is I and 5th is N. So not.\n\nWe need the 4th to be N. So the word must be: ?1 ?2 ?3 N ?5\n\nSo, for example: \n- ""BEGAN"" -> B E G A N -> but E is out (we know E is not in the word) and also 4th is A? 1:B, 2:E, 3:G, 4:A, 5:N -> 4th is A, not N.\n\nAnother: ""BEGIN"" -> B E G I N -> E is out.\n\n""LOGIN"" -> L O G I N -> 4th is I, 5th is N -> not 4th as N.\n\nWe need the 4th letter to be N. So the word must have the structure: ...N? meaning the fourth letter is N and then the fifth is something.\n\nExamples: \n- ""FJORD"" -> but has R and we know R is out.\n- ""DEMON"" -> D E M O N -> E is out.\n\nWithout E and R and C.\n\nHow about: ""SAUNA"" -> S A U N A -> 1:S, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:A -> yes! 4th is N. And A is in 2nd and 5th, not 3rd. Also, no C, R, E.\n\nBut is SAUNA a valid word? Yes, it is.\n\nBut we have two A\'s? That\'s okay.\n\nBut we also have S and U to test.\n\nAnother word: ""MANGA"" -> M A N G A -> but 3rd is N? 1:M, 2:A, 3:N, 4:G, 5:A -> 4th is G, not N.\n\n""PIANO"" -> P I A N O -> 1:P, 2:I, 3:A, 4:N, 5:O -> 4th is N! And A is in 3rd? But we know A cannot be in 3rd? Because in the first guess, A was in 3rd and got a dash. So if we put A in 3rd again, it would be wrong. But in PIANO, A is in 3rd, which we know is incorrect. So we should avoid that.\n\nWe need a word that has A not in 3rd and 4th is N.\n\nSo, back to ""SAUNA"": \n- Positions: 1:S, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:A -> A is in 2nd and 5th, not 3rd. So that\'s okay.\n\nBut we have two A\'s? The feedback only told us that A is in the word (at least one), but it might have more? So that\'s possible.\n\nAnother word: ""TAWNY"" -> T A W N Y -> 1:T, 2:A, 3:W, 4:N, 5:Y -> 4th is N, and A in 2nd. And no C, R, E.\n\nBut we don\'t know if Y is in the word? But that\'s okay.\n\n""DAUNT"" -> D A U N T -> 1:D, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:T -> 4th is N, A in 2nd.\n\n""VAUNT"" -> V A U N T -> same.\n\nBut we haven\'t tested many new letters.\n\nWe also want to cover more vowels? We have A already, but we don\'t know about I, O, U.\n\nIn SAUNA, we test S, A, U, N, A. But we already know N is in the 4th and correct, and A is in the word. So we are testing S and U.\n\nIn TAWNY, we test T, A, W, N, Y.\n\nWe might also consider words that put A in the 5th position? For example: _ _ _ N A\n\nLike ""PIZZA"" -> but has Z and Z, and 4th is Z? 1:P, 2:I, 3:Z, 4:Z, 5:A -> not N at 4th.\n\n""JUMNA"" -> not a word.\n\n""TUNNA"" -> not common.\n\n""DUNA"" -> not 5 letters.\n\nSo, let\'s go with ""TAWNY"" or ""SAUNA"". \n\nBut note: in SAUNA, the 5th letter is A, which we already know is in the word. So if we get a dash for the 5th A, we know it\'s because it\'s in the word but not there? But we don\'t know if there is a second A. It might be redundant.\n\nSimilarly, in TAWNY, we have Y which is less common.\n\nAnother word: ""PLAIN"" is not because 4th is not N.\n\n""TRAIN"" has R which is out.\n\nHow about ""SHINY"" -> S H I N Y -> 1:S, 2:H, 3:I, 4:N, 5:Y -> 4th is N? But we need to include A? We know A is in the word, so we must include A in the guess? Because if we don\'t, we might miss information about A.\n\nImportant: We know A is in the word, so we should try to find its position. Therefore, our next guess must include A (but not in the 3rd position) and have N in the 4th.\n\nSo, we cannot avoid including A.\n\nTherefore, let\'s choose a word that has A and N (at 4th) and three new letters.\n\nOptions:\n- ""SAUNA"": tests S, A, U, N, A -> but A is repeated. We test S and U. The 5th A might be redundant.\n- ""TAWNY"": tests T, A, W, N, Y -> new letters: T, W, Y.\n- ""DAUNT"": tests D, A, U, N, T -> new letters: D, U, T.\n\n""FAUNA"": F A U N A -> similar to SAUNA.\n\n""LAUAN"": not common.\n\n""MAUNA"": not common.\n\n""PAWNS"": P A W N S -> 1:P, 2:A, 3:W, 4:N, 5:S -> 4th is N? Yes. And A in 2nd. New letters: P, W, S.\n\nBut we already tried S? In the first guess we didn\'t use S. First guess was CRANE: C, R, A, N, E. So S is new.\n\nBut in PAWNS, the 4th is N? Let\'s check: P-A-W-N-S -> positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:W, 4:N, 5:S -> yes, 4th is N.\n\nAnd A is in 2nd, not 3rd.\n\nAlso, no C, R, E.\n\nSo, PAWNS: P, A, W, N, S.\n\nWe test P, W, S, and we already know A and N (N is fixed).\n\nBut note: we are testing A in the 2nd position.\n\nSimilarly, we could do ""MAWNS"" or ""DAWNS"", but DAWNS has D and S.\n\nBut PAWNS is a valid word.\n\nAnother option: ""GAUNT"": G A U N T -> 1:G, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:T -> 4th is N? Actually, 4th is N? G-A-U-N-T -> 1:G, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:T -> yes.\n\nAnd A in 2nd.\n\nBut we have U and T.\n\nI think PAWNS or GAUNT are good.\n\nBut let\'s choose one that has more common letters.\n\nCommon consonants: S, T, L, N, etc. We have N already.\n\nWe haven\'t tried S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.\n\nIn PAWNS, we test P, A, W, N, S -> W is less common? But we need to test.\n\nIn GAUNT, we test G, A, U, N, T -> U is a vowel, which might be useful.\n\nBut we know the word has A, and we don\'t know about other vowels.\n\nAnother word: ""PLANK"" -> P L A N K -> 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:K -> but A is in 3rd, which we know is incorrect. So avoid.\n\n""THANK"" -> T H A N K -> 1:T, 2:H, 3:A, 4:N, 5:K -> again A in 3rd, avoid.\n\n""STAIN"" -> S T A I N -> 1:S, 2:T, 3:A, 4:I, 5:N -> 4th is I, not N. So no.\n\nWe must have 4th as N.\n\nSo, let\'s go with ""PAWNS"". It tests P, A, W, N, S.\n\nBut note: the word PAWNS has S at the end, which is common.\n\nAlternatively, ""TAWNY"" tests T, A, W, N, Y.\n\nI think PAWNS is better because S is more common than Y.\n\nBut we can also consider ""SANDY"" -> but 4th is D? S A N D Y -> 1:S, 2:A, 3:N, 4:D, 5:Y -> 3rd is N, not 4th. So no.\n\n""BANDY"" -> B A N D Y -> 3rd is N? 1:B, 2:A, 3:N, 4:D, 5:Y -> not 4th as N.\n\nSo, I think ""PAWNS"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me confirm: the word is PAWNS, meaning to take something in a greedy way? Or the plural of pawn? It\'s a valid word.\n\nAnother common word: ""PLANT"" -> but 4th is N? P L A N T -> 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:T -> 4th is N? Actually, 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:T -> yes, 4th is N. But A is in 3rd? We know A cannot be in 3rd. So avoid.\n\nSimilarly, ""SLANT"" -> same issue.\n\nSo, we need to avoid A in 3rd.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""PAWNS"".\n\nBut in PAWNS, the A is in 2nd, which is good.\n\nSo, my next guess: PAWNS.\n\nBut note: we are not forced to put N in the 4th? Actually, we know that N is in the 4th position, so we can keep it there to get more information about other positions.\n\nIf we don\'t put N in the 4th, we might not learn about the other positions? But we know it\'s fixed, so we can use that to our advantage.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with PAWNS.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- C, R, and E are not in the word (x).\n- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position (-).\n- N is in the word and correctly placed in the 4th position (✓).\n\nKey insights:\n- The secret word has N as the 4th letter.\n- A is present but not in the 3rd position (so it must be in position 1, 2, or 5).\n- The word does not contain C, R, or E.\n- For the next guess, we should:\n  - Retain N in the 4th position to confirm it (though it\'s already confirmed, this helps test other letters).\n  - Include A in a new position (1, 2, or 5) to narrow down its location.\n  - Avoid C, R, and E entirely.\n  - Test new common letters (e.g., S, T, P, L, D) to gather more information.\n\nAfter evaluating possible words, ""PAWNS"" is a strong choice because:\n- It places A in the 2nd position (a new spot to test).\n- It keeps N in the 4th position.\n- It tests new common letters: P, W, and S.\n- It avoids C, R, E and does not repeat the 3rd-position A error.\n- ""PAWNS"" is a valid 5-letter English word (meaning to gamble or pledge).\n\nThis guess will provide feedback on:\n- Whether A is in the 2nd position (✓ or -).\n- Whether P, W, or S are in the word and their positions.\n\n<guess>PAWNS</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: PAWNS -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) W(x) N(✓) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: CRANE\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)\n- N: ✓ (correct, in position 4)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nGuess 2: PAWNS\n- P: x (not in the word)\n- A: ✓ (correct, in position 2)  [Note: In PAWNS, A is the second letter, so now we know A is in position 2]\n- W: x (not in the word)\n- N: ✓ (correct, in position 4) [We already knew this]\n- S: x (not in the word)\n\nSo, from the feedback, we now know:\n- The second letter is A (from PAWNS: A is ✓ in position 2).\n- The fourth letter is N (from both guesses).\n- The word does not contain: C, R, E, P, W, S.\n\nAlso, from the first guess, we knew A was not in position 3, but now we know it is in position 2.\n\nTherefore, the current known information:\n- Position 2: A\n- Position 4: N\n- Forbidden letters: C, R, E, P, W, S\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that has:\n- Second letter: A\n- Fourth letter: N\n- Does not contain: C, R, E, P, W, S\n\nWe also need to guess the first, third, and fifth letters.\n\nWe have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, P, W, S. So we should avoid these except A and N which are in the word.\n\nAvailable letters: We can use any letter except the forbidden ones. Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we need to form a valid English word.\n\nThe pattern is: _ A _ N _\n\nWe need to fill the first, third, and fifth positions.\n\nWe also know that the word must have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, but it might. We have A already, which is a vowel. Other vowels: I, O, U (E is out).\n\nLet\'s think of common words that fit the pattern _ A _ N _\n\nExamples:\n- ""BANDY"" -> but S is out? B A N D Y -> but we need fourth letter to be N? In ""BANDY"": positions: 1:B, 2:A, 3:N, 4:D, 5:Y -> but we need position 4 to be N, here it\'s D. So no.\n- ""MANGO"" -> M A N G O -> 1:M, 2:A, 3:N, 4:G, 5:O -> position 4 is G, not N.\n- ""TANGY"" -> T A N G Y -> 1:T, 2:A, 3:N, 4:G, 5:Y -> position 4 is G, not N.\n\nWe need the fourth letter to be N, so the third letter can be anything but must not be a position that conflicts.\n\nThe pattern is: first letter, then A (2nd), then some letter (3rd), then N (4th), then some letter (5th).\n\nSo, words like:\n- ""DAUNT"" -> D A U N T -> 1:D, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:T -> this fits the pattern. And D, U, T are not forbidden? Forbidden: C,R,E,P,W,S. So D, U, T are allowed.\n- ""FAUNA"" -> F A U N A -> 1:F, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:A -> but A is repeated? But we know A is in the word, and we have it in position 2, so having another A is possible. But in this case, the fifth letter is A. Also, F and U are allowed.\n- ""GAUNT"" -> G A U N T -> same as DAUNT but with G.\n- ""HAUNT"" -> H A U N T -> H, A, U, N, T.\n- ""JAUNT"" -> J A U N T -> J is less common.\n- ""VAUNT"" -> V A U N T -> V is allowed.\n\nBut note: in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was wrong, but now we are not putting A in position 3, so it\'s okay.\n\nWe also have words like:\n- ""LATIN"" -> L A T I N -> 1:L, 2:A, 3:T, 4:I, 5:N -> but position 4 is I, not N. So no.\n- ""RABIN"" -> but R is forbidden.\n\nAnother set: words ending with ""AND"" but we need the fourth to be N, so not.\n\nOr words like ""PLAIN"" but P is forbidden and position 4 is not N.\n\nSo, the candidates are: DAUNT, FAUNA, GAUNT, HAUNT, JAUNT, VAUNT, etc.\n\nBut we also have to consider that we don\'t know if there are duplicate letters. But that\'s okay.\n\nNow, we want to test as many new letters as possible to get information.\n\nWe have not used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z.\n\nCommon letters: T, L, D, M, O, U, etc.\n\nIn the words above, DAUNT, FAUNA, GAUNT, HAUNT, VAUNT all have U and T (except FAUNA has A again).\n\nFAUNA has F and U, but the fifth letter is A, which we already know. So it might not give new information about another letter.\n\nSimilarly, DAUNT has D, U, T.\n\nWe could choose a word that has a vowel in the fifth position to test for vowels? We know E is out, so other vowels are I, O, U.\n\nU is in many of these words.\n\nAnother word: ""MANGY"" -> M A N G Y -> but position 4 is G? No.\n\n""BALDY"" -> B A L D Y -> position 4 is D, not N.\n\nWe need to stick to the pattern.\n\nAnother possibility: ""TAINT"" -> T A I N T -> 1:T, 2:A, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T -> this fits: position 4 is N? 1:T, 2:A, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T -> yes! And T is not forbidden? T is not in the forbidden list (C,R,E,P,W,S are forbidden, T is okay).\n\nBut ""TAINT"" has two T\'s? That\'s possible.\n\nAlso, it tests T and I.\n\nBut we have to avoid S, which we are.\n\nSimilarly, ""PAINT"" but P is forbidden.\n\n""SAINT"" has S, forbidden.\n\n""FAINT"" -> F A I N T -> 1:F, 2:A, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T -> this also fits, and F, I, T are new.\n\nSimilarly, ""GAIN"" is 4 letters.\n\n""RAINY"" has R, forbidden.\n\nSo, options: DAUNT (D,A,U,N,T), FAUNA (F,A,U,N,A), FAINT (F,A,I,N,T), TAINT (T,A,I,N,T), etc.\n\nNow, to maximize information, we might avoid repeating letters if possible. FAUNA has two A\'s, which might not be efficient. TAINT has two T\'s.\n\nFAINT has all distinct except we know A and N are already in, but F, I, T are new and distinct.\n\nSimilarly, DAUNT has D, U, T, all new and distinct (A and N known).\n\nBut in DAUNT, the fifth letter is T, which is a consonant. We might want to test a vowel in the fifth position? But not necessary.\n\nWe could also consider ""HAVIN"" but not a word, or ""BAKIN"" not standard.\n\n""MAINS"" has S, forbidden.\n\nAnother word: ""LAVIN"" not common.\n\nI think FAINT is a good choice: it tests F, I, and T, and has the pattern with A in 2nd and N in 4th.\n\nSimilarly, ""JOINT"" but J is less common and O? J A O N T? No, pattern: J A ? N T, but third letter must be O? ""JOINT"" is J O I N T -> not A in second.\n\nWe need A in second.\n\nSo, back to FAINT: F A I N T.\n\nThis will tell us about F, I, and T.\n\nIf we get feedback, we can narrow down.\n\nSimilarly, we could do ""DAINT"" but not a common word? ""DAINT"" is not standard, usually ""dainty"" but that\'s 6 letters.\n\nSo, FAINT is valid.\n\nAnother option: ""GAUNT"" is valid, but it has U instead of I.\n\nWe don\'t know if the word has I or U or O.\n\nTo cover more vowels, I might choose FAINT to test I.\n\nBut let\'s see the frequency.\n\nWe could also choose a word with O, like ""OCTAN"" but O C T A N -> C is forbidden, and pattern not matching.\n\n""MANOR"" has R and not matching pattern.\n\nI think FAINT is a solid choice.\n\nBut note: in FAINT, the fifth letter is T, which is a common consonant.\n\nWe could do ""MAINS"" but S is forbidden.\n\n""BAILS"" has S.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with FAINT.\n\nBut let\'s confirm: F is allowed, A is known in position 2, I is new, N known in 4, T new.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, guess: FAINT.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(not in word), R(not in word), A(in word but wrong position), N(correct position), E(not in word).  \n- **Guess 2: PAWNS** → Feedback: P(not in word), A(correct position), W(not in word), N(correct position), S(not in word).\n\n### Key Insights:\n- **Position 2 is A** (confirmed by Guess 2).\n- **Position 4 is N** (confirmed by both guesses).\n- **Excluded letters**: C, R, E, P, W, S (not in the word).\n- **Pattern**: The word must follow `_ A _ N _`.\n- **Remaining positions to solve**: 1st, 3rd, and 5th letters.\n- **Available letters**: All letters except excluded ones (C, R, E, P, W, S). Focus on common letters like D, F, G, H, I, L, M, O, T, U, V, Y.\n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- Test high-frequency consonants (e.g., T, L, D) and vowels (e.g., I, O, U) in positions 1, 3, and 5.\n- Prioritize words with distinct new letters to maximize information.\n- Avoid repeating known incorrect letters or positions (e.g., A cannot be in position 3).\n\nSelected word: **FAINT**  \n- Fits the pattern `_ A _ N _` (A in position 2, N in position 4).\n- Tests new common letters: \n  - **F** in position 1 (common consonant).\n  - **I** in position 3 (vowel not yet tested).\n  - **T** in position 5 (high-frequency consonant).\n- Avoids excluded letters and repeats.\n\nThis guess will provide feedback on F, I, and T, helping to narrow down the remaining letters and positions.\n\n<guess>FAINT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: PAWNS -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) W(x) N(✓) S(x)\nGuess 3: FAINT -> FEEDBACK: F(x) A(✓) I(x) N(✓) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: x → not in word
- R: x → not in word
- A: - → in word but wrong position (was in position 3)
- N: ✓ → correct and in position
- E: x → not in word

Guess 2: PAWNS
- P: x → not in word
- A: ✓ → correct and in position 2
- W: x → not in word
- N: ✓ → correct and in position 4 (already known)
- S: x → not in word

Guess 3: FAINT
- F: x → not in word
- A: ✓ → correct and in position 2 (already known)
- I: x → not in word
- N: ✓ → correct and in position 4 (already known)
- T: x → not in word

Thus, we know the following:

1. Positions:
   - Position 2: A
   - Position 4: N

2. Excluded letters (not in the word at all):
   C, R, E, P, W, S, F, I, T

3. The remaining word pattern is: _ A _ N _

We need to fill positions 1, 3, and 5 with letters not in the excluded list.

Excluded letters: C, E, F, I, P, R, S, T, W

So available letters:
A, B, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

But note: from Guess 1, we had A classified as in the word but wrong position. At that time, it was in position 3. Now we know A is fixed in position 2. Therefore, the A in the word is accounted for by this fixed position. That means there might be no other A? Or could there be duplicate A? The feedback from Guess 1 indicated A was present but not in position 3. Now with A fixed at position 2, it's possible the word has only one A. However, duplicates are allowed, so we cannot rule out another A. But in position 5, for example.

But to be efficient, we might use other vowels or common consonants.

Now, the pattern: ?1 A ?3 N ?5

We also know from the first guess that A was in position 3 and marked wrong, so position 3 cannot be A? Actually, we now know position 2 is A, so the A in position 3 in the first guess must be the letter from position 2 that was misplaced? But no: wait, the word has A, so having A in position 3 in CRANE was incorrect only if position 3 is not A? But now we see position 2 is A, so the A in CRANE at position 3 was wrong because A belongs at position 2. Thus, the word has only one A? Or if there is another A, it might be in another position? The feedback doesn't rule out duplicate A. But to simplify, we can proceed without assuming duplication for now.

For position 3, we can try other vowels: O, U, Y or consonants.

We have not tested: B, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

Common choices: try vowels in position 3 and common consonants for positions 1 and 5.

Possible words:

Endings: Since position 4 is N, common words ending in N: like ?A?N?.

Examples:
- BA: ?3 could be U, L, R (R excluded) → not
- DA: DA?N? → DAUNT we thought before, but U and T? T excluded
DAUNT has D,A,U,N,T → T is excluded now (from FAINT feedback, T is not in word). But U is not excluded? U hasn't been excluded.

But TAINT, FAINT had T excluded? Yes.

In FAINT feedback, T is x, so not in word.

Therefore, T is excluded.

Similarly, DAUNT: D, A, U, N, T → but T is excluded, so we cannot have T? Unless we find a word without T.

Now, without T.

What words fit _ A _ N _ ?

For example:
- ""DANDY"" → D A N D Y → but position 3 is N? 1:D, 2:A, 3:N, 4:D, 5:Y → position 4 is D, not N → no
- ""LANKY"" → L A N K Y → 3:N? 1:L,2:A,3:N,4:K,5:Y → position 4 is K, not N → no
- ""MANLY"" → M A N L Y → 3:N? 1:M,2:A,3:N,4:L,5:Y → position 4 is L, not N → no
- ""BANJO"" → B A N J O → 3:N? 1:B,2:A,3:N,4:J,5:O → position 4 is J? Not N → no

We need position 4 to be N, so ?3 can be any letter? Then N at position 4.

So words like:
- ""DAU N ?"" → but 5th must be provided, e.g., ""DAUNT"" but T not allowed

Without T.

""GAUNG"" not word

""HAU N ?"" → ""HAUNT"" has T excluded

""MAU N ?"" → ""MAUND"" → M A U N D → 1:M,2:A,3:U,4:N,5:D → this fits! And D, M, U? Not excluded.

Similarly, ""FAUND"" not a word

""VAUNT"" has T excluded

""JAUNT"" has T excluded

""LAUND"" not common

""YAUND"" not word

But ""MANOR"" has R excluded and not N at 4

""BAG N ?"" → ""BAGGY"" not N at 4

Another possibility: ""MAG N ?"" → ""MAGUN"" not word

Or ""HANDY"" has H A N D Y → position 4 is D? Not N

We need the 4th position to be N.

So the pattern is: ?1 A ?3 N ?5

Examples:
- ""BALUN"" → not common word
- ""CALYX"" → C excluded
- ""DAMAN"" → D A M A N → 1:D,2:A,3:M,4:A,5:N → position 4 is A? Not N → no

""LAMIN"" → L A M I N → 1:L,2:A,3:M,4:I,5:N → position 4 is I? Not N → no

""TAWNY"" but W and T excluded

Consider: ""GAUMY"" → G A U M Y → 1:G,2:A,3:U,4:M,5:Y → position 4 is M? Not N → no

How about ""KAON"" is 4 letters

""MAVIN"" → M A V I N → 1:M,2:A,3:V,4:I,5:N → again position 4 is I? Not N → no

We must have position 4 as N, so the word is ... N ?

Perhaps words ending with N? But then position 5 is blank? It has to be a 5-letter word.

Position 5 can be any letter.

For example, ""DAVIN"" not word.

Another idea: ""RAJAN"" has R excluded.

Perhaps ""BAYAN"" → B A Y A N → 1:B,2:A,3:Y,4:A,5:N → position 4 is A? Not N → no

I see a pattern: many words put the N later or earlier.

Let's think of common words with A in 2nd, N in 4th.

Example: ""BAD N ?"" → not

""SAXON"" has S excluded and S in first? Position 1:S,2:A,3:X,4:O,5:N → position 4 is O? Not N → no

""TAKEN"" has T excluded and position 4? T A K E N → 1:T,2:A,3:K,4:E,5:N → position 4 is E? Not N → no

Perhaps ""JAI?N"" → ""JALAN"" not common

Another word: ""CABIN"" has C excluded and not N at 4

Wait, perhaps I missed: ""FAGIN"" but F excluded and not N at 4? F A G I N -> position 4 I

""LAR N ?"" not

""MARNS"" has S and R excluded

Oh, ""OAKEN"" has E excluded? E in ""OAKEN"" O A K E N -> position 4 E, not N; and E excluded.

Perhaps ""QUA N ?"" → ""QUAND"" → Q U A N D? Doesn't fit pattern; we need A in second? No, QUAND: Q U A N D -> positions: 1:Q,2:U,3:A,4:N,5:D → we have A at position 3? But pattern requires A at position 2? Our word has A in position 2.

To have A at position 2, the first letter must be one letter, then A.

So ""QUA"" is not helpful.

"" YACHT"" has C and T excluded, not matching pattern.

I think I am missing: ""DAH N ?""

Perhaps: ""DAHL N"" not a word.

But ""DAVEN"" → D A V E N -> E excluded? E is excluded.

D A V E N -> position 4 E? And E out.

""NAVAN"" -> N A V A N -> 1:N,2:A,3:V,4:A,5:N -> position 4 is A? Not N.

""PAVAN"" has P excluded.

Another common word: ""KAYAK"" not pattern.

We need to consider the possibility of our previous candidate ""MAUND"". I think ""MAUND"" is a word meaning a unit of weight or a basket? Valid.

MAUND: M A U N D -> positions: 1:M, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:D

Yes, pattern _ A _ N _ with A in 2nd, N in 4th.

Letters M, U, D are not excluded.

Similarly, ""DAUND"" not word.

""GAUND"" not common.

Or ""HAUND"" variant of ""hound""? Not.

""LAUND"" not common.

""MAUND"" is acceptable.

Another option: ""BAVIN"" -> B A V I N -> position 4 I? Not N -> no

""CAVIL"" C excluded.

""YAMUN"" -> Y A M U N -> 1:Y,2:A,3:M,4:U,5:N -> position 4 is U? Not N -> no

""BALDN"" not word.

We can try ""LADIN"" -> L A D I N -> 1:L,2:A,3:D,4:I,5:N -> position 4 I not N.

Wait, ""RAINY"" has R excluded.

Perhaps ""JA M N?"" not.

""GAED"" is short.

I think ""MAUND"" is a candidate.

But we can also consider ""YAUD N"" not a word.

Another word: ""QA N A?"" not.

Perhaps ""UA   "" not.

Since fewer options, maybe try MAUND.

But note that in MAUND, the D is the fifth letter.

We have not tested D.

Similarly, U and M.

We could also choose ""HAND"" not 5 letters.

""BANDY"" but position 4 D.

Another possibility: ""WAND"" not 5 letters.

""LAN  D"" not.

""VAN  "" not.

""CANED"" C and E excluded.

Perhaps ""OAK N"" not.

I found: ""DAH N A"" not.

""BAIG N"" not.

Perhaps ""JAMUN"" is a word? Fruit, but not common.

In scrabble, ""MAUND"" is valid.

Another common word: ""OASIS"" has S and not N at 4.

But we must use a word that fits.

""OASIS"" is O A S I S -> S excluded.

Not.

""MANAS"" M A N A S -> position 4 A not N -> no

""MANAS"" is not the pattern.

Perhaps ""MANGA"" M A N G A -> position 3 N? 1:M,2:A,3:N,4:G,5:A -> position 4 G not N.

Always position 4 not N.

Unless the word is like X A Y N Z.

Where Y any letter.

So, let's list possible words: MAUND is one.

Other: ""GRAND"" G R A N D -> R excluded, and position 4 N? But position 1:G,2:R,3:A,4:N,5:D -> position 4 is N? Yes, but A is in position 3? We need A in position 2. In GRAND, A is in position 3? Positions: 1:G,2:R,3:A,4:N,5:D -> A at 3.

But in our case, A must be at position 2.

So for A in position 2, we have few options.

Another word: ""ALIGN"" A in position 1? A L I G N -> position 1 A, but we need position 2 A.

The word ""BANAL"" B A N A L -> position 4 A not N.

Not.

""CANAL"" C excluded, and position 4 A.

I think we are limited.

It appears MAUND is a valid choice.

""YAUD"" is 4 letters.

""DAHLIA"" is 6.

So, I'll go with MAUND.

But let's confirm the excluded letters: C,E,F,I,P,R,S,T,W are out. MAUND has M,A,U,N,D. A and N are in, M,U,D are not excluded.

So, yes.

Another word: ""HABAN"" not word.

""KAGAN"" K A G A N -> position 4 A not N.

No.

So, MAUND it is.

Given the feedback from previous guesses:

1. **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(✓), E(x)  
   - Revealed: N is in position 4, A is in the word but not in position 3. Letters C, R, E are not in the word.

2. **Guess 2: PAWNS** → Feedback: P(x), A(✓), W(x), N(✓), S(x)  
   - Confirmed: A is in position 2, N is in position 4. Letters P, W, S are not in the word.

3. **Guess 3: FAINT** → Feedback: F(x), A(✓), I(x), N(✓), T(x)  
   - Confirmed: A in position 2 and N in position 4 unchanged. Letters F, I, T are not in the word.

### Key Insights:
- **Fixed positions**: Position 2 is **A**, position 4 is **N**.
- **Excluded letters**: C, E, F, I, P, R, S, T, W (not in the word).
- **Pattern**: The word must be `_ A _ N _` (positions 1, 3, and 5 unknown).
- **Available letters**: Focus on untested common letters like B, D, G, H, L, M, O, U, V, Y.

### Strategy:
- Test a word that fits `_ A _ N _`, using high-frequency consonants/vowels in positions 1, 3, and 5.
- Prioritize distinct new letters to maximize information.
- Avoid repeating excluded letters or known incorrect positions.
- ""MAUND"" is a valid 5-letter word (meaning a unit of weight or basket) that fits:
  - **M** in position 1 (tests common consonant).
  - **U** in position 3 (tests vowel not yet tried).
  - **D** in position 5 (tests common consonant).
- Letters M, U, D are untested and not excluded.

This guess will provide feedback on M, U, and D, narrowing possibilities significantly.

<guess>MAUND</guess>",MAUND,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: x → not in word
- R: x → not in word
- A: - → in word but wrong position (was in position 3)
- N: ✓ → correct and in position
- E: x → not in word

Guess 2: PAWNS
- P: x → not in word
- A: ✓ → correct and in position 2
- W: x → not in word
- N: ✓ → correct and in position 4 (already known)
- S: x → not in word

Guess 3: FAINT
- F: x → not in word
- A: ✓ → correct and in position 2 (already known)
- I: x → not in word
- N: ✓ → correct and in position 4 (already known)
- T: x → not in word

Thus, we know the following:

1. Positions:
   - Position 2: A
   - Position 4: N

2. Excluded letters (not in the word at all):
   C, R, E, P, W, S, F, I, T

3. The remaining word pattern is: _ A _ N _

We need to fill positions 1, 3, and 5 with letters not in the excluded list.

Excluded letters: C, E, F, I, P, R, S, T, W

So available letters:
A, B, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

But note: from Guess 1, we had A classified as in the word but wrong position. At that time, it was in position 3. Now we know A is fixed in position 2. Therefore, the A in the word is accounted for by this fixed position. That means there might be no other A? Or could there be duplicate A? The feedback from Guess 1 indicated A was present but not in position 3. Now with A fixed at position 2, it's possible the word has only one A. However, duplicates are allowed, so we cannot rule out another A. But in position 5, for example.

But to be efficient, we might use other vowels or common consonants.

Now, the pattern: ?1 A ?3 N ?5

We also know from the first guess that A was in position 3 and marked wrong, so position 3 cannot be A? Actually, we now know position 2 is A, so the A in position 3 in the first guess must be the letter from position 2 that was misplaced? But no: wait, the word has A, so having A in position 3 in CRANE was incorrect only if position 3 is not A? But now we see position 2 is A, so the A in CRANE at position 3 was wrong because A belongs at position 2. Thus, the word has only one A? Or if there is another A, it might be in another position? The feedback doesn't rule out duplicate A. But to simplify, we can proceed without assuming duplication for now.

For position 3, we can try other vowels: O, U, Y or consonants.

We have not tested: B, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

Common choices: try vowels in position 3 and common consonants for positions 1 and 5.

Possible words:

Endings: Since position 4 is N, common words ending in N: like ?A?N?.

Examples:
- BA: ?3 could be U, L, R (R excluded) → not
- DA: DA?N? → DAUNT we thought before, but U and T? T excluded
DAUNT has D,A,U,N,T → T is excluded now (from FAINT feedback, T is not in word). But U is not excluded? U hasn't been excluded.

But TAINT, FAINT had T excluded? Yes.

In FAINT feedback, T is x, so not in word.

Therefore, T is excluded.

Similarly, DAUNT: D, A, U, N, T → but T is excluded, so we cannot have T? Unless we find a word without T.

Now, without T.

What words fit _ A _ N _ ?

For example:
- ""DANDY"" → D A N D Y → but position 3 is N? 1:D, 2:A, 3:N, 4:D, 5:Y → position 4 is D, not N → no
- ""LANKY"" → L A N K Y → 3:N? 1:L,2:A,3:N,4:K,5:Y → position 4 is K, not N → no
- ""MANLY"" → M A N L Y → 3:N? 1:M,2:A,3:N,4:L,5:Y → position 4 is L, not N → no
- ""BANJO"" → B A N J O → 3:N? 1:B,2:A,3:N,4:J,5:O → position 4 is J? Not N → no

We need position 4 to be N, so ?3 can be any letter? Then N at position 4.

Without T.

 A good starting word should have repeating letters? But 5-letter with no repeats? 
 Actually, it's often better to have a word with common letters and distinct to cover more ground.
 Let me pick a word that has letters that are frequently used in English: e.g., vowels: A, E, I and common consonants: R, S, T, N.
 One of the popular starting words is ""SLATE"" because it has S, L, A, T, E -> which are common and it covers two vowels (A and E) and three common consonants.

 However, note: We don't know the word list? But we are allowed to guess any valid English word. I'll go with ""SLATE"".

 But note: the problem says ""valid 5-letter English word"", so I have to choose a word that I know is valid.

 Alternative: ""CRANE"" is also a common starter? It has C, R, A, N, E -> two vowels (A and E) and three consonants.

 Actually, let me choose ""ROATE"". Wait, is that common? Maybe not. 

 Actually, I recall that ""STARE"" is a good starter? It has S, T, A, R, E -> two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants.

 But to maximize distinct letters and common ones, I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E. 

 However, I can also choose ""SLATE"" or ""TRACE"". 

 I think I'll pick ""CRATE"" because it covers C, R, A, T, E -> which includes common consonants and two vowels (A and E). 

 Wait, let me decide: 

 Option 1: SLATE -> letters: S, L, A, T, E
 Option 2: CRANE -> C, R, A, N, E
 Option 3: TRACE -> T, R, A, C, E -> same as CRATE? Actually CRATE: C,R,A,T,E

 Actually, to have a good coverage, I will choose ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".For the first guess, I need a word that maximizes information by including common vowels and consonants. Letters like R, S, T, L, N, E, and A provide broad coverage. ""CRANE"" includes C, R, A, N, E—common letters with minimal repetition. This will give solid feedback on frequent consonants and vowels while leaving room for adjustments in subsequent guesses.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: ✓ (correct position, so the word has N as the 4th letter)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
1. The 4th letter is N.
2. The letter A is in the word, but not in the 3rd position (since it was in the 3rd in CRANE and got a dash).
3. The letters C, R, and E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Must have an A somewhere (but not in position 3) and must have N in position 4.

Also, we know the word does not contain C, R, or E.

Now, for the next guess, we want to try to find the positions of A and also cover other common letters that haven't been tried yet.

We have used: C, R, A, N, E. So we should avoid these except A and N (which we know are in the word). But note: R and E are out, so we cannot use them.

Available letters: We can use any letters except C, R, E. Also, we know A is in the word but not in position 3, and N is fixed at position 4.

We must form a 5-letter word that has:
- The 4th letter as N (because we know it's correct and in place).
- The letter A must appear, but not in the 3rd position.

Also, we want to test other common letters to get more information.

Common consonants we haven't tried: S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.

We can try to put A in a different position (like 1st or 2nd or 5th) and also test other vowels? But note, we have only one vowel so far (A) and we know E is out. So other vowels: I, O, U? But we don't know if they are present.

Let's think of words that have:
- 4th letter is N
- Include A (but not in 3rd position)
- Do not include C, R, E

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, or 5.

We also want to cover new letters.

Let me try to think of words that end with N and have A.

For example:
- Words with A in the first position: e.g., ""A__ N"", but the 4th is N, so the word pattern: A _ _ N _ 
- Or A in the second: _ A _ N _
- Or A in the fifth: _ _ _ N A

But note: we have to avoid C, R, E.

Let's list some words:

Option 1: A in the first position: e.g., ""ADMIN"" -> but has M and D, and I. But we don't know about these letters. Also, the 4th is N? ADMIN: A D M I N -> positions: 1:A, 2:D, 3:M, 4:I, 5:N -> wait, that doesn't have N at 4th? Actually, the 4th is I and 5th is N. So not.

We need the 4th letter to be N. So the word must be: _ _ _ N _

So, for A in first: A _ _ N _
For example: ""ALIGN"" -> A L I G N -> but 4th is G? No, positions: 1:A, 2:L, 3:I, 4:G, 5:N -> not N at 4th.

We need the 4th letter to be N, so the word pattern: ?1 ?2 ?3 N ?5

So, for A in first: A ?2 ?3 N ?5
For example: ""ASIAN"" -> A S I A N -> but that has two A's? And positions: 1:A, 2:S, 3:I, 4:A, 5:N -> 4th is A, not N. So no.

Another: ""AVIAN"" -> A V I A N -> 1:A, 2:V, 3:I, 4:A, 5:N -> again 4th is A.

We need the 4th to be N. So the word must have the 4th letter as N.

Examples of words with 4th letter N:
- ...N. -> like ""URBAN"", ""TRAIN"", but we cannot use R (and TRAIN has R and we know R is not in the word). Also, URBAN has R and U, but R is out.

Without R and E and C.

Let me think: 
- ""PLAIN"" -> P L A I N -> but here A is in the 3rd position? We know A cannot be in 3rd because in the first guess A was in 3rd and got a dash (meaning it's in the word but not in 3rd). So in PLAIN, if we put A in 3rd, that would be the same position? But we are allowed to use A again? But the feedback said A is in the word but not in 3rd, so we should avoid putting A in 3rd again because we know it's not there.

But in PLAIN, the pattern is: P L A I N -> so 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:I, 5:N -> but we need 4th to be N? Here 4th is I and 5th is N. So not.

We need the 4th to be N. So the word must be: ?1 ?2 ?3 N ?5

So, for example: 
- ""BEGAN"" -> B E G A N -> but E is out (we know E is not in the word) and also 4th is A? 1:B, 2:E, 3:G, 4:A, 5:N -> 4th is A, not N.

Another: ""BEGIN"" -> B E G I N -> E is out.

""LOGIN"" -> L O G I N -> 4th is I, 5th is N -> not 4th as N.

We need the 4th letter to be N. So the word must have the structure: ...N? meaning the fourth letter is N and then the fifth is something.

Examples: 
- ""FJORD"" -> but has R and we know R is out.
- ""DEMON"" -> D E M O N -> E is out.

Without E and R and C.

How about: ""SAUNA"" -> S A U N A -> 1:S, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:A -> yes! 4th is N. And A is in 2nd and 5th, not 3rd. Also, no C, R, E.

But is SAUNA a valid word? Yes, it is.

But we have two A's? That's okay.

But we also have S and U to test.

Another word: ""MANGA"" -> M A N G A -> but 3rd is N? 1:M, 2:A, 3:N, 4:G, 5:A -> 4th is G, not N.

""PIANO"" -> P I A N O -> 1:P, 2:I, 3:A, 4:N, 5:O -> 4th is N! And A is in 3rd? But we know A cannot be in 3rd? Because in the first guess, A was in 3rd and got a dash. So if we put A in 3rd again, it would be wrong. But in PIANO, A is in 3rd, which we know is incorrect. So we should avoid that.

We need a word that has A not in 3rd and 4th is N.

So, back to ""SAUNA"": 
- Positions: 1:S, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:A -> A is in 2nd and 5th, not 3rd. So that's okay.

But we have two A's? The feedback only told us that A is in the word (at least one), but it might have more? So that's possible.

Another word: ""TAWNY"" -> T A W N Y -> 1:T, 2:A, 3:W, 4:N, 5:Y -> 4th is N, and A in 2nd. And no C, R, E.

But we don't know if Y is in the word? But that's okay.

""DAUNT"" -> D A U N T -> 1:D, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:T -> 4th is N, A in 2nd.

""VAUNT"" -> V A U N T -> same.

But we haven't tested many new letters.

We also want to cover more vowels? We have A already, but we don't know about I, O, U.

In SAUNA, we test S, A, U, N, A. But we already know N is in the 4th and correct, and A is in the word. So we are testing S and U.

In TAWNY, we test T, A, W, N, Y.

We might also consider words that put A in the 5th position? For example: _ _ _ N A

Like ""PIZZA"" -> but has Z and Z, and 4th is Z? 1:P, 2:I, 3:Z, 4:Z, 5:A -> not N at 4th.

""JUMNA"" -> not a word.

""TUNNA"" -> not common.

""DUNA"" -> not 5 letters.

So, let's go with ""TAWNY"" or ""SAUNA"". 

But note: in SAUNA, the 5th letter is A, which we already know is in the word. So if we get a dash for the 5th A, we know it's because it's in the word but not there? But we don't know if there is a second A. It might be redundant.

Similarly, in TAWNY, we have Y which is less common.

Another word: ""PLAIN"" is not because 4th is not N.

""TRAIN"" has R which is out.

How about ""SHINY"" -> S H I N Y -> 1:S, 2:H, 3:I, 4:N, 5:Y -> 4th is N? But we need to include A? We know A is in the word, so we must include A in the guess? Because if we don't, we might miss information about A.

Important: We know A is in the word, so we should try to find its position. Therefore, our next guess must include A (but not in the 3rd position) and have N in the 4th.

So, we cannot avoid including A.

Therefore, let's choose a word that has A and N (at 4th) and three new letters.

Options:
- ""SAUNA"": tests S, A, U, N, A -> but A is repeated. We test S and U. The 5th A might be redundant.
- ""TAWNY"": tests T, A, W, N, Y -> new letters: T, W, Y.
- ""DAUNT"": tests D, A, U, N, T -> new letters: D, U, T.

""FAUNA"": F A U N A -> similar to SAUNA.

""LAUAN"": not common.

""MAUNA"": not common.

""PAWNS"": P A W N S -> 1:P, 2:A, 3:W, 4:N, 5:S -> 4th is N? Yes. And A in 2nd. New letters: P, W, S.

But we already tried S? In the first guess we didn't use S. First guess was CRANE: C, R, A, N, E. So S is new.

But in PAWNS, the 4th is N? Let's check: P-A-W-N-S -> positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:W, 4:N, 5:S -> yes, 4th is N.

And A is in 2nd, not 3rd.

Also, no C, R, E.

So, PAWNS: P, A, W, N, S.

We test P, W, S, and we already know A and N (N is fixed).

But note: we are testing A in the 2nd position.

Similarly, we could do ""MAWNS"" or ""DAWNS"", but DAWNS has D and S.

But PAWNS is a valid word.

Another option: ""GAUNT"": G A U N T -> 1:G, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:T -> 4th is N? Actually, 4th is N? G-A-U-N-T -> 1:G, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:T -> yes.

And A in 2nd.

But we have U and T.

I think PAWNS or GAUNT are good.

But let's choose one that has more common letters.

Common consonants: S, T, L, N, etc. We have N already.

We haven't tried S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.

In PAWNS, we test P, A, W, N, S -> W is less common? But we need to test.

In GAUNT, we test G, A, U, N, T -> U is a vowel, which might be useful.

But we know the word has A, and we don't know about other vowels.

Another word: ""PLANK"" -> P L A N K -> 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:K -> but A is in 3rd, which we know is incorrect. So avoid.

""THANK"" -> T H A N K -> 1:T, 2:H, 3:A, 4:N, 5:K -> again A in 3rd, avoid.

""STAIN"" -> S T A I N -> 1:S, 2:T, 3:A, 4:I, 5:N -> 4th is I, not N. So no.

We must have 4th as N.

So, let's go with ""PAWNS"". It tests P, A, W, N, S.

But note: the word PAWNS has S at the end, which is common.

Alternatively, ""TAWNY"" tests T, A, W, N, Y.

I think PAWNS is better because S is more common than Y.

But we can also consider ""SANDY"" -> but 4th is D? S A N D Y -> 1:S, 2:A, 3:N, 4:D, 5:Y -> 3rd is N, not 4th. So no.

""BANDY"" -> B A N D Y -> 3rd is N? 1:B, 2:A, 3:N, 4:D, 5:Y -> not 4th as N.

So, I think ""PAWNS"" is a good choice.

But let me confirm: the word is PAWNS, meaning to take something in a greedy way? Or the plural of pawn? It's a valid word.

Another common word: ""PLANT"" -> but 4th is N? P L A N T -> 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:T -> 4th is N? Actually, 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:T -> yes, 4th is N. But A is in 3rd? We know A cannot be in 3rd. So avoid.

Similarly, ""SLANT"" -> same issue.

So, we need to avoid A in 3rd.

Therefore, I choose ""PAWNS"".

But in PAWNS, the A is in 2nd, which is good.

So, my next guess: PAWNS.

But note: we are not forced to put N in the 4th? Actually, we know that N is in the 4th position, so we can keep it there to get more information about other positions.

If we don't put N in the 4th, we might not learn about the other positions? But we know it's fixed, so we can use that to our advantage.

So, I'll go with PAWNS.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, R, and E are not in the word (x).
- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position (-).
- N is in the word and correctly placed in the 4th position (✓).

Key insights:
- The secret word has N as the 4th letter.
- A is present but not in the 3rd position (so it must be in position 1, 2, or 5).
- The word does not contain C, R, or E.
- For the next guess, we should:
  - Retain N in the 4th position to confirm it (though it's already confirmed, this helps test other letters).
  - Include A in a new position (1, 2, or 5) to narrow down its location.
  - Avoid C, R, and E entirely.
  - Test new common letters (e.g., S, T, P, L, D) to gather more information.

After evaluating possible words, ""PAWNS"" is a strong choice because:
- It places A in the 2nd position (a new spot to test).
- It keeps N in the 4th position.
- It tests new common letters: P, W, and S.
- It avoids C, R, E and does not repeat the 3rd-position A error.
- ""PAWNS"" is a valid 5-letter English word (meaning to gamble or pledge).

This guess will provide feedback on:
- Whether A is in the 2nd position (✓ or -).
- Whether P, W, or S are in the word and their positions.

<guess>PAWNS</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: PAWNS -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) W(x) N(✓) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
- N: ✓ (correct, in position 4)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: PAWNS
- P: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct, in position 2)  [Note: In PAWNS, A is the second letter, so now we know A is in position 2]
- W: x (not in the word)
- N: ✓ (correct, in position 4) [We already knew this]
- S: x (not in the word)

So, from the feedback, we now know:
- The second letter is A (from PAWNS: A is ✓ in position 2).
- The fourth letter is N (from both guesses).
- The word does not contain: C, R, E, P, W, S.

Also, from the first guess, we knew A was not in position 3, but now we know it is in position 2.

Therefore, the current known information:
- Position 2: A
- Position 4: N
- Forbidden letters: C, R, E, P, W, S

We need to form a 5-letter word that has:
- Second letter: A
- Fourth letter: N
- Does not contain: C, R, E, P, W, S

We also need to guess the first, third, and fifth letters.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, P, W, S. So we should avoid these except A and N which are in the word.

Available letters: We can use any letter except the forbidden ones. Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z.

But we need to form a valid English word.

The pattern is: _ A _ N _

We need to fill the first, third, and fifth positions.

We also know that the word must have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, but it might. We have A already, which is a vowel. Other vowels: I, O, U (E is out).

Let's think of common words that fit the pattern _ A _ N _

Examples:
- ""BANDY"" -> but S is out? B A N D Y -> but we need fourth letter to be N? In ""BANDY"": positions: 1:B, 2:A, 3:N, 4:D, 5:Y -> but we need position 4 to be N, here it's D. So no.
- ""MANGO"" -> M A N G O -> 1:M, 2:A, 3:N, 4:G, 5:O -> position 4 is G, not N.
- ""TANGY"" -> T A N G Y -> 1:T, 2:A, 3:N, 4:G, 5:Y -> position 4 is G, not N.

We need the fourth letter to be N, so the third letter can be anything but must not be a position that conflicts.

The pattern is: first letter, then A (2nd), then some letter (3rd), then N (4th), then some letter (5th).

So, words like:
- ""DAUNT"" -> D A U N T -> 1:D, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:T -> this fits the pattern. And D, U, T are not forbidden? Forbidden: C,R,E,P,W,S. So D, U, T are allowed.
- ""FAUNA"" -> F A U N A -> 1:F, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:A -> but A is repeated? But we know A is in the word, and we have it in position 2, so having another A is possible. But in this case, the fifth letter is A. Also, F and U are allowed.
- ""GAUNT"" -> G A U N T -> same as DAUNT but with G.
- ""HAUNT"" -> H A U N T -> H, A, U, N, T.
- ""JAUNT"" -> J A U N T -> J is less common.
- ""VAUNT"" -> V A U N T -> V is allowed.

But note: in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was wrong, but now we are not putting A in position 3, so it's okay.

We also have words like:
- ""LATIN"" -> L A T I N -> 1:L, 2:A, 3:T, 4:I, 5:N -> but position 4 is I, not N. So no.
- ""RABIN"" -> but R is forbidden.

Another set: words ending with ""AND"" but we need the fourth to be N, so not.

Or words like ""PLAIN"" but P is forbidden and position 4 is not N.

So, the candidates are: DAUNT, FAUNA, GAUNT, HAUNT, JAUNT, VAUNT, etc.

But we also have to consider that we don't know if there are duplicate letters. But that's okay.

Now, we want to test as many new letters as possible to get information.

We have not used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z.

Common letters: T, L, D, M, O, U, etc.

In the words above, DAUNT, FAUNA, GAUNT, HAUNT, VAUNT all have U and T (except FAUNA has A again).

FAUNA has F and U, but the fifth letter is A, which we already know. So it might not give new information about another letter.

Similarly, DAUNT has D, U, T.

We could choose a word that has a vowel in the fifth position to test for vowels? We know E is out, so other vowels are I, O, U.

U is in many of these words.

Another word: ""MANGY"" -> M A N G Y -> but position 4 is G? No.

""BALDY"" -> B A L D Y -> position 4 is D, not N.

We need to stick to the pattern.

Another possibility: ""TAINT"" -> T A I N T -> 1:T, 2:A, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T -> this fits: position 4 is N? 1:T, 2:A, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T -> yes! And T is not forbidden? T is not in the forbidden list (C,R,E,P,W,S are forbidden, T is okay).

But ""TAINT"" has two T's? That's possible.

Also, it tests T and I.

But we have to avoid S, which we are.

Similarly, ""PAINT"" but P is forbidden.

""SAINT"" has S, forbidden.

""FAINT"" -> F A I N T -> 1:F, 2:A, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T -> this also fits, and F, I, T are new.

Similarly, ""GAIN"" is 4 letters.

""RAINY"" has R, forbidden.

So, options: DAUNT (D,A,U,N,T), FAUNA (F,A,U,N,A), FAINT (F,A,I,N,T), TAINT (T,A,I,N,T), etc.

Now, to maximize information, we might avoid repeating letters if possible. FAUNA has two A's, which might not be efficient. TAINT has two T's.

FAINT has all distinct except we know A and N are already in, but F, I, T are new and distinct.

Similarly, DAUNT has D, U, T, all new and distinct (A and N known).

But in DAUNT, the fifth letter is T, which is a consonant. We might want to test a vowel in the fifth position? But not necessary.

We could also consider ""HAVIN"" but not a word, or ""BAKIN"" not standard.

""MAINS"" has S, forbidden.

Another word: ""LAVIN"" not common.

I think FAINT is a good choice: it tests F, I, and T, and has the pattern with A in 2nd and N in 4th.

Similarly, ""JOINT"" but J is less common and O? J A O N T? No, pattern: J A ? N T, but third letter must be O? ""JOINT"" is J O I N T -> not A in second.

We need A in second.

So, back to FAINT: F A I N T.

This will tell us about F, I, and T.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Similarly, we could do ""DAINT"" but not a common word? ""DAINT"" is not standard, usually ""dainty"" but that's 6 letters.

So, FAINT is valid.

Another option: ""GAUNT"" is valid, but it has U instead of I.

We don't know if the word has I or U or O.

To cover more vowels, I might choose FAINT to test I.

But let's see the frequency.

We could also choose a word with O, like ""OCTAN"" but O C T A N -> C is forbidden, and pattern not matching.

""MANOR"" has R and not matching pattern.

I think FAINT is a solid choice.

But note: in FAINT, the fifth letter is T, which is a common consonant.

We could do ""MAINS"" but S is forbidden.

""BAILS"" has S.

So, I'll go with FAINT.

But let's confirm: F is allowed, A is known in position 2, I is new, N known in 4, T new.

Yes.

So, guess: FAINT.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(not in word), R(not in word), A(in word but wrong position), N(correct position), E(not in word).  
- **Guess 2: PAWNS** → Feedback: P(not in word), A(correct position), W(not in word), N(correct position), S(not in word).

### Key Insights:
- **Position 2 is A** (confirmed by Guess 2).
- **Position 4 is N** (confirmed by both guesses).
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, E, P, W, S (not in the word).
- **Pattern**: The word must follow `_ A _ N _`.
- **Remaining positions to solve**: 1st, 3rd, and 5th letters.
- **Available letters**: All letters except excluded ones (C, R, E, P, W, S). Focus on common letters like D, F, G, H, I, L, M, O, T, U, V, Y.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Test high-frequency consonants (e.g., T, L, D) and vowels (e.g., I, O, U) in positions 1, 3, and 5.
- Prioritize words with distinct new letters to maximize information.
- Avoid repeating known incorrect letters or positions (e.g., A cannot be in position 3).

Selected word: **FAINT**  
- Fits the pattern `_ A _ N _` (A in position 2, N in position 4).
- Tests new common letters: 
  - **F** in position 1 (common consonant).
  - **I** in position 3 (vowel not yet tested).
  - **T** in position 5 (high-frequency consonant).
- Avoids excluded letters and repeats.

This guess will provide feedback on F, I, and T, helping to narrow down the remaining letters and positions.

3. The remaining word pattern is: _ A _ N _

We need to fill positions 1, 3, and 5 with letters not in the excluded list.

Excluded letters: C, E, F, I, P, R, S, T, W

So available letters:
A, B, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

But note: from Guess 1, we had A classified as in the word but wrong position. At that time, it was in position 3. Now we know A is fixed in position 2. Therefore, the A in the word is accounted for by this fixed position. That means there might be no other A? Or could there be duplicate A? The feedback from Guess 1 indicated A was present but not in position 3. Now with A fixed at position 2, it's possible the word has only one A. However, duplicates are allowed, so we cannot rule out another A. But in position 5, for example.

But to be efficient, we might use other vowels or common consonants.

Now, the pattern: ?1 A ?3 N ?5

We also know from the first guess that A was in position 3 and marked wrong, so position 3 cannot be A? Actually, we now know position 2 is A, so the A in position 3 in the first guess must be the letter from position 2 that was misplaced? But no: wait, the word has A, so having A in position 3 in CRANE was incorrect only if position 3 is not A? But now we see position 2 is A, so the A in CRANE at position 3 was wrong because A belongs at position 2. Thus, the word has only one A? Or if there is another A, it might be in another position? The feedback doesn't rule out duplicate A. But to simplify, we can proceed without assuming duplication for now.

For position 3, we can try other vowels: O, U, Y or consonants.

We have not tested: B, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

Common choices: try vowels in position 3 and common consonants for positions 1 and 5.

Possible words:

Endings: Since position 4 is N, common words ending in N: like ?A?N?.

Examples:
- BA: ?3 could be U, L, R (R excluded) → not
- DA: DA?N? → DAUNT we thought before, but U and T? T excluded
DAUNT has D,A,U,N,T → T is excluded now (from FAINT feedback, T is not in word). But U is not excluded? U hasn't been excluded.

But TAINT, FAINT had T excluded? Yes.

In FAINT feedback, T is x, so not in word.

Therefore, T is excluded.

Similarly, DAUNT: D, A, U, N, T → but T is excluded, so we cannot have T? Unless we find a word without T.

Now, without T.

What words fit _ A _ N _ ?

For example:
- ""DANDY"" → D A N D Y → but position 3 is N? 1:D, 2:A, 3:N, 4:D, 5:Y → position 4 is D, not N → no
- ""LANKY"" → L A N K Y → 3:N? 1:L,2:A,3:N,4:K,5:Y → position 4 is K, not N → no
- ""MANLY"" → M A N L Y → 3:N? 1:M,2:A,3:N,4:L,5:Y → position 4 is L, not N → no
- ""BANJO"" → B A N J O → 3:N? 1:B,2:A,3:N,4:J,5:O → position 4 is J? Not N → no

We need position 4 to be N, so ?3 can be any letter? Then N at position 4.

So words like:
- ""DAU N ?"" → but 5th must be provided, e.g., ""DAUNT"" but T not allowed

Without T.

""GAUNG"" not word

""HAU N ?"" → ""HAUNT"" has T excluded

""MAU N ?"" → ""MAUND"" → M A U N D → 1:M,2:A,3:U,4:N,5:D → this fits! And D, M, U? Not excluded.

Similarly, ""FAUND"" not a word

""VAUNT"" has T excluded

""JAUNT"" has T excluded

""LAUND"" not common

""YAUND"" not word

But ""MANOR"" has R excluded and not N at 4

""BAG N ?"" → ""BAGGY"" not N at 4

Another possibility: ""MAG N ?"" → ""MAGUN"" not word

Or ""HANDY"" has H A N D Y → position 4 is D? Not N

We need the 4th position to be N.

So the pattern is: ?1 A ?3 N ?5

Examples:
- ""BALUN"" → not common word
- ""CALYX"" → C excluded
- ""DAMAN"" → D A M A N → 1:D,2:A,3:M,4:A,5:N → position 4 is A? Not N → no

""LAMIN"" → L A M I N → 1:L,2:A,3:M,4:I,5:N → position 4 is I? Not N → no

""TAWNY"" but W and T excluded

Consider: ""GAUMY"" → G A U M Y → 1:G,2:A,3:U,4:M,5:Y → position 4 is M? Not N → no

How about ""KAON"" is 4 letters

""MAVIN"" → M A V I N → 1:M,2:A,3:V,4:I,5:N → again position 4 is I? Not N → no

We must have position 4 as N, so the word is ... N ?

Perhaps words ending with N? But then position 5 is blank? It has to be a 5-letter word.

Position 5 can be any letter.

For example, ""DAVIN"" not word.

Another idea: ""RAJAN"" has R excluded.

Perhaps ""BAYAN"" → B A Y A N → 1:B,2:A,3:Y,4:A,5:N → position 4 is A? Not N → no

I see a pattern: many words put the N later or earlier.

Let's think of common words with A in 2nd, N in 4th.

Example: ""BAD N ?"" → not

""SAXON"" has S excluded and S in first? Position 1:S,2:A,3:X,4:O,5:N → position 4 is O? Not N → no

""TAKEN"" has T excluded and position 4? T A K E N → 1:T,2:A,3:K,4:E,5:N → position 4 is E? Not N → no

Perhaps ""JAI?N"" → ""JALAN"" not common

Another word: ""CABIN"" has C excluded and not N at 4

Wait, perhaps I missed: ""FAGIN"" but F excluded and not N at 4? F A G I N -> position 4 I

""LAR N ?"" not

""MARNS"" has S and R excluded

Oh, ""OAKEN"" has E excluded? E in ""OAKEN"" O A K E N -> position 4 E, not N; and E excluded.

Perhaps ""QUA N ?"" → ""QUAND"" → Q U A N D? Doesn't fit pattern; we need A in second? No, QUAND: Q U A N D -> positions: 1:Q,2:U,3:A,4:N,5:D → we have A at position 3? But pattern requires A at position 2? Our word has A in position 2.

To have A at position 2, the first letter must be one letter, then A.

So ""QUA"" is not helpful.

"" YACHT"" has C and T excluded, not matching pattern.

I think I am missing: ""DAH N ?""

Perhaps: ""DAHL N"" not a word.

But ""DAVEN"" → D A V E N -> E excluded? E is excluded.

D A V E N -> position 4 E? And E out.

""NAVAN"" -> N A V A N -> 1:N,2:A,3:V,4:A,5:N -> position 4 is A? Not N.

""PAVAN"" has P excluded.

Another common word: ""KAYAK"" not pattern.

We need to consider the possibility of our previous candidate ""MAUND"". I think ""MAUND"" is a word meaning a unit of weight or a basket? Valid.

MAUND: M A U N D -> positions: 1:M, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:D

Yes, pattern _ A _ N _ with A in 2nd, N in 4th.

Letters M, U, D are not excluded.

Similarly, ""DAUND"" not word.

""GAUND"" not common.

Or ""HAUND"" variant of ""hound""? Not.

""LAUND"" not common.

""MAUND"" is acceptable.

Another option: ""BAVIN"" -> B A V I N -> position 4 I? Not N -> no

""CAVIL"" C excluded.

""YAMUN"" -> Y A M U N -> 1:Y,2:A,3:M,4:U,5:N -> position 4 is U? Not N -> no

""BALDN"" not word.

We can try ""LADIN"" -> L A D I N -> 1:L,2:A,3:D,4:I,5:N -> position 4 I not N.

Wait, ""RAINY"" has R excluded.

Perhaps ""JA M N?"" not.

""GAED"" is short.

I think ""MAUND"" is a candidate.

But we can also consider ""YAUD N"" not a word.

Another word: ""QA N A?"" not.

Perhaps ""UA   "" not.

Since fewer options, maybe try MAUND.

But note that in MAUND, the D is the fifth letter.

We have not tested D.

Similarly, U and M.

We could also choose ""HAND"" not 5 letters.

""BANDY"" but position 4 D.

Another possibility: ""WAND"" not 5 letters.

""LAN  D"" not.

""VAN  "" not.

""CANED"" C and E excluded.

Perhaps ""OAK N"" not.

I found: ""DAH N A"" not.

""BAIG N"" not.

Perhaps ""JAMUN"" is a word? Fruit, but not common.

In scrabble, ""MAUND"" is valid.

Another common word: ""OASIS"" has S and not N at 4.

But we must use a word that fits.

""OASIS"" is O A S I S -> S excluded.

Not.

""MANAS"" M A N A S -> position 4 A not N -> no

""MANAS"" is not the pattern.

Perhaps ""MANGA"" M A N G A -> position 3 N? 1:M,2:A,3:N,4:G,5:A -> position 4 G not N.

Always position 4 not N.

Unless the word is like X A Y N Z.

Where Y any letter.

So, let's list possible words: MAUND is one.

Other: ""GRAND"" G R A N D -> R excluded, and position 4 N? But position 1:G,2:R,3:A,4:N,5:D -> position 4 is N? Yes, but A is in position 3? We need A in position 2. In GRAND, A is in position 3? Positions: 1:G,2:R,3:A,4:N,5:D -> A at 3.

But in our case, A must be at position 2.

So for A in position 2, we have few options.

Another word: ""ALIGN"" A in position 1? A L I G N -> position 1 A, but we need position 2 A.

The word ""BANAL"" B A N A L -> position 4 A not N.

Not.

""CANAL"" C excluded, and position 4 A.

I think we are limited.

It appears MAUND is a valid choice.

""YAUD"" is 4 letters.

""DAHLIA"" is 6.

So, I'll go with MAUND.

But let's confirm the excluded letters: C,E,F,I,P,R,S,T,W are out. MAUND has M,A,U,N,D. A and N are in, M,U,D are not excluded.

So, yes.

Another word: ""HABAN"" not word.

""KAGAN"" K A G A N -> position 4 A not N.

No.

So, MAUND it is.Given the feedback from previous guesses:

1. **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(✓), E(x)  
   - Revealed: N is in position 4, A is in the word but not in position 3. Letters C, R, E are not in the word.

2. **Guess 2: PAWNS** → Feedback: P(x), A(✓), W(x), N(✓), S(x)  
   - Confirmed: A is in position 2, N is in position 4. Letters P, W, S are not in the word.

3. **Guess 3: FAINT** → Feedback: F(x), A(✓), I(x), N(✓), T(x)  
   - Confirmed: A in position 2 and N in position 4 unchanged. Letters F, I, T are not in the word.

### Key Insights:
- **Fixed positions**: Position 2 is **A**, position 4 is **N**.
- **Excluded letters**: C, E, F, I, P, R, S, T, W (not in the word).
- **Pattern**: The word must be `_ A _ N _` (positions 1, 3, and 5 unknown).
- **Available letters**: Focus on untested common letters like B, D, G, H, L, M, O, U, V, Y.

### Strategy:
- Test a word that fits `_ A _ N _`, using high-frequency consonants/vowels in positions 1, 3, and 5.
- Prioritize distinct new letters to maximize information.
- Avoid repeating excluded letters or known incorrect positions.
- ""MAUND"" is a valid 5-letter word (meaning a unit of weight or basket) that fits:
  - **M** in position 1 (tests common consonant).
  - **U** in position 3 (tests vowel not yet tried).
  - **D** in position 5 (tests common consonant).
- Letters M, U, D are untested and not excluded.

This guess will provide feedback on M, U, and D, narrowing possibilities significantly.

But we don\'t know about these letters. Also, the 4th is N? ADMIN: A D M I N -> positions: 1:A, 2:D, 3:M, 4:I, 5:N -> wait, that doesn\'t have N at 4th? Actually, the 4th is I and 5th is N. So not.\n\nWe need the 4th letter to be N. So the word must be: _ _ _ N _\n\nSo, for A in first: A _ _ N _\nFor example: ""ALIGN"" -> A L I G N -> but 4th is G? No, positions: 1:A, 2:L, 3:I, 4:G, 5:N -> not N at 4th.\n\nWe need the 4th letter to be N, so the word pattern: ?1 ?2 ?3 N ?5\n\nSo, for A in first: A ?2 ?3 N ?5\nFor example: ""ASIAN"" -> A S I A N -> but that has two A\'s? And positions: 1:A, 2:S, 3:I, 4:A, 5:N -> 4th is A, not N. So no.\n\nAnother: ""AVIAN"" -> A V I A N -> 1:A, 2:V, 3:I, 4:A, 5:N -> again 4th is A.\n\nWe need the 4th to be N. So the word must have the 4th letter as N.\n\nExamples of words with 4th letter N:\n- ...N. -> like ""URBAN"", ""TRAIN"", but we cannot use R (and TRAIN has R and we know R is not in the word). Also, URBAN has R and U, but R is out.\n\nWithout R and E and C.\n\nLet me think: \n- ""PLAIN"" -> P L A I N -> but here A is in the 3rd position? We know A cannot be in 3rd because in the first guess A was in 3rd and got a dash (meaning it\'s in the word but not in 3rd). So in PLAIN, if we put A in 3rd, that would be the same position? But we are allowed to use A again? But the feedback said A is in the word but not in 3rd, so we should avoid putting A in 3rd again because we know it\'s not there.\n\nBut in PLAIN, the pattern is: P L A I N -> so 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:I, 5:N -> but we need 4th to be N? Here 4th is I and 5th is N. So not.\n\nWe need the 4th to be N. So the word must be: ?1 ?2 ?3 N ?5\n\nSo, for example: \n- ""BEGAN"" -> B E G A N -> but E is out (we know E is not in the word) and also 4th is A? 1:B, 2:E, 3:G, 4:A, 5:N -> 4th is A, not N.\n\nAnother: ""BEGIN"" -> B E G I N -> E is out.\n\n""LOGIN"" -> L O G I N -> 4th is I, 5th is N -> not 4th as N.\n\nWe need the 4th letter to be N. So the word must have the structure: ...N? meaning the fourth letter is N and then the fifth is something.\n\nExamples: \n- ""FJORD"" -> but has R and we know R is out.\n- ""DEMON"" -> D E M O N -> E is out.\n\nWithout E and R and C.\n\nHow about: ""SAUNA"" -> S A U N A -> 1:S, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:A -> yes! 4th is N. And A is in 2nd and 5th, not 3rd. Also, no C, R, E.\n\nBut is SAUNA a valid word? Yes, it is.\n\nBut we have two A\'s? That\'s okay.\n\nBut we also have S and U to test.\n\nAnother word: ""MANGA"" -> M A N G A -> but 3rd is N? 1:M, 2:A, 3:N, 4:G, 5:A -> 4th is G, not N.\n\n""PIANO"" -> P I A N O -> 1:P, 2:I, 3:A, 4:N, 5:O -> 4th is N! And A is in 3rd? But we know A cannot be in 3rd? Because in the first guess, A was in 3rd and got a dash. So if we put A in 3rd again, it would be wrong. But in PIANO, A is in 3rd, which we know is incorrect. So we should avoid that.\n\nWe need a word that has A not in 3rd and 4th is N.\n\nSo, back to ""SAUNA"": \n- Positions: 1:S, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:A -> A is in 2nd and 5th, not 3rd. So that\'s okay.\n\nBut we have two A\'s? The feedback only told us that A is in the word (at least one), but it might have more? So that\'s possible.\n\nAnother word: ""TAWNY"" -> T A W N Y -> 1:T, 2:A, 3:W, 4:N, 5:Y -> 4th is N, and A in 2nd. And no C, R, E.\n\nBut we don\'t know if Y is in the word? But that\'s okay.\n\n""DAUNT"" -> D A U N T -> 1:D, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:T -> 4th is N, A in 2nd.\n\n""VAUNT"" -> V A U N T -> same.\n\nBut we haven\'t tested many new letters.\n\nWe also want to cover more vowels? We have A already, but we don\'t know about I, O, U.\n\nIn SAUNA, we test S, A, U, N, A. But we already know N is in the 4th and correct, and A is in the word. So we are testing S and U.\n\nIn TAWNY, we test T, A, W, N, Y.\n\nWe might also consider words that put A in the 5th position? For example: _ _ _ N A\n\nLike ""PIZZA"" -> but has Z and Z, and 4th is Z? 1:P, 2:I, 3:Z, 4:Z, 5:A -> not N at 4th.\n\n""JUMNA"" -> not a word.\n\n""TUNNA"" -> not common.\n\n""DUNA"" -> not 5 letters.\n\nSo, let\'s go with ""TAWNY"" or ""SAUNA"". \n\nBut note: in SAUNA, the 5th letter is A, which we already know is in the word. So if we get a dash for the 5th A, we know it\'s because it\'s in the word but not there? But we don\'t know if there is a second A. It might be redundant.\n\nSimilarly, in TAWNY, we have Y which is less common.\n\nAnother word: ""PLAIN"" is not because 4th is not N.\n\n""TRAIN"" has R which is out.\n\nHow about ""SHINY"" -> S H I N Y -> 1:S, 2:H, 3:I, 4:N, 5:Y -> 4th is N? But we need to include A? We know A is in the word, so we must include A in the guess? Because if we don\'t, we might miss information about A.\n\nImportant: We know A is in the word, so we should try to find its position. Therefore, our next guess must include A (but not in the 3rd position) and have N in the 4th.\n\nSo, we cannot avoid including A.\n\nTherefore, let\'s choose a word that has A and N (at 4th) and three new letters.\n\nOptions:\n- ""SAUNA"": tests S, A, U, N, A -> but A is repeated. We test S and U. The 5th A might be redundant.\n- ""TAWNY"": tests T, A, W, N, Y -> new letters: T, W, Y.\n- ""DAUNT"": tests D, A, U, N, T -> new letters: D, U, T.\n\n""FAUNA"": F A U N A -> similar to SAUNA.\n\n""LAUAN"": not common.\n\n""MAUNA"": not common.\n\n""PAWNS"": P A W N S -> 1:P, 2:A, 3:W, 4:N, 5:S -> 4th is N? Yes. And A in 2nd. New letters: P, W, S.\n\nBut we already tried S? In the first guess we didn\'t use S. First guess was CRANE: C, R, A, N, E. So S is new.\n\nBut in PAWNS, the 4th is N? Let\'s check: P-A-W-N-S -> positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:W, 4:N, 5:S -> yes, 4th is N.\n\nAnd A is in 2nd, not 3rd.\n\nAlso, no C, R, E.\n\nSo, PAWNS: P, A, W, N, S.\n\nWe test P, W, S, and we already know A and N (N is fixed).\n\nBut note: we are testing A in the 2nd position.\n\nSimilarly, we could do ""MAWNS"" or ""DAWNS"", but DAWNS has D and S.\n\nBut PAWNS is a valid word.\n\nAnother option: ""GAUNT"": G A U N T -> 1:G, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:T -> 4th is N? Actually, 4th is N? G-A-U-N-T -> 1:G, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:T -> yes.\n\nAnd A in 2nd.\n\nBut we have U and T.\n\nI think PAWNS or GAUNT are good.\n\nBut let\'s choose one that has more common letters.\n\nCommon consonants: S, T, L, N, etc. We have N already.\n\nWe haven\'t tried S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.\n\nIn PAWNS, we test P, A, W, N, S -> W is less common? But we need to test.\n\nIn GAUNT, we test G, A, U, N, T -> U is a vowel, which might be useful.\n\nBut we know the word has A, and we don\'t know about other vowels.\n\nAnother word: ""PLANK"" -> P L A N K -> 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:K -> but A is in 3rd, which we know is incorrect. So avoid.\n\n""THANK"" -> T H A N K -> 1:T, 2:H, 3:A, 4:N, 5:K -> again A in 3rd, avoid.\n\n""STAIN"" -> S T A I N -> 1:S, 2:T, 3:A, 4:I, 5:N -> 4th is I, not N. So no.\n\nWe must have 4th as N.\n\nSo, let\'s go with ""PAWNS"". It tests P, A, W, N, S.\n\nBut note: the word PAWNS has S at the end, which is common.\n\nAlternatively, ""TAWNY"" tests T, A, W, N, Y.\n\nI think PAWNS is better because S is more common than Y.\n\nBut we can also consider ""SANDY"" -> but 4th is D? S A N D Y -> 1:S, 2:A, 3:N, 4:D, 5:Y -> 3rd is N, not 4th. So no.\n\n""BANDY"" -> B A N D Y -> 3rd is N? 1:B, 2:A, 3:N, 4:D, 5:Y -> not 4th as N.\n\nSo, I think ""PAWNS"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me confirm: the word is PAWNS, meaning to take something in a greedy way? Or the plural of pawn? It\'s a valid word.\n\nAnother common word: ""PLANT"" -> but 4th is N? P L A N T -> 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:T -> 4th is N? Actually, 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:T -> yes, 4th is N. But A is in 3rd? We know A cannot be in 3rd. So avoid.\n\nSimilarly, ""SLANT"" -> same issue.\n\nSo, we need to avoid A in 3rd.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""PAWNS"".\n\nBut in PAWNS, the A is in 2nd, which is good.\n\nSo, my next guess: PAWNS.\n\nBut note: we are not forced to put N in the 4th? Actually, we know that N is in the 4th position, so we can keep it there to get more information about other positions.\n\nIf we don\'t put N in the 4th, we might not learn about the other positions? But we know it\'s fixed, so we can use that to our advantage.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with PAWNS.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- C, R, and E are not in the word (x).\n- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position (-).\n- N is in the word and correctly placed in the 4th position (✓).\n\nKey insights:\n- The secret word has N as the 4th letter.\n- A is present but not in the 3rd position (so it must be in position 1, 2, or 5).\n- The word does not contain C, R, or E.\n- For the next guess, we should:\n  - Retain N in the 4th position to confirm it (though it\'s already confirmed, this helps test other letters).\n  - Include A in a new position (1, 2, or 5) to narrow down its location.\n  - Avoid C, R, and E entirely.\n  - Test new common letters (e.g., S, T, P, L, D) to gather more information.\n\nAfter evaluating possible words, ""PAWNS"" is a strong choice because:\n- It places A in the 2nd position (a new spot to test).\n- It keeps N in the 4th position.\n- It tests new common letters: P, W, and S.\n- It avoids C, R, E and does not repeat the 3rd-position A error.\n- ""PAWNS"" is a valid 5-letter English word (meaning to gamble or pledge).\n\nThis guess will provide feedback on:\n- Whether A is in the 2nd position (✓ or -).\n- Whether P, W, or S are in the word and their positions.\n\n<guess>PAWNS</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: PAWNS -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) W(x) N(✓) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: CRANE\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)\n- N: ✓ (correct, in position 4)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nGuess 2: PAWNS\n- P: x (not in the word)\n- A: ✓ (correct, in position 2)  [Note: In PAWNS, A is the second letter, so now we know A is in position 2]\n- W: x (not in the word)\n- N: ✓ (correct, in position 4) [We already knew this]\n- S: x (not in the word)\n\nSo, from the feedback, we now know:\n- The second letter is A (from PAWNS: A is ✓ in position 2).\n- The fourth letter is N (from both guesses).\n- The word does not contain: C, R, E, P, W, S.\n\nAlso, from the first guess, we knew A was not in position 3, but now we know it is in position 2.\n\nTherefore, the current known information:\n- Position 2: A\n- Position 4: N\n- Forbidden letters: C, R, E, P, W, S\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that has:\n- Second letter: A\n- Fourth letter: N\n- Does not contain: C, R, E, P, W, S\n\nWe also need to guess the first, third, and fifth letters.\n\nWe have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, P, W, S. So we should avoid these except A and N which are in the word.\n\nAvailable letters: We can use any letter except the forbidden ones. Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we need to form a valid English word.\n\nThe pattern is: _ A _ N _\n\nWe need to fill the first, third, and fifth positions.\n\nWe also know that the word must have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, but it might. We have A already, which is a vowel. Other vowels: I, O, U (E is out).\n\nLet\'s think of common words that fit the pattern _ A _ N _\n\nExamples:\n- ""BANDY"" -> but S is out? B A N D Y -> but we need fourth letter to be N? In ""BANDY"": positions: 1:B, 2:A, 3:N, 4:D, 5:Y -> but we need position 4 to be N, here it\'s D. So no.\n- ""MANGO"" -> M A N G O -> 1:M, 2:A, 3:N, 4:G, 5:O -> position 4 is G, not N.\n- ""TANGY"" -> T A N G Y -> 1:T, 2:A, 3:N, 4:G, 5:Y -> position 4 is G, not N.\n\nWe need the fourth letter to be N, so the third letter can be anything but must not be a position that conflicts.\n\nThe pattern is: first letter, then A (2nd), then some letter (3rd), then N (4th), then some letter (5th).\n\nSo, words like:\n- ""DAUNT"" -> D A U N T -> 1:D, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:T -> this fits the pattern. And D, U, T are not forbidden? Forbidden: C,R,E,P,W,S. So D, U, T are allowed.\n- ""FAUNA"" -> F A U N A -> 1:F, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:A -> but A is repeated? But we know A is in the word, and we have it in position 2, so having another A is possible. But in this case, the fifth letter is A. Also, F and U are allowed.\n- ""GAUNT"" -> G A U N T -> same as DAUNT but with G.\n- ""HAUNT"" -> H A U N T -> H, A, U, N, T.\n- ""JAUNT"" -> J A U N T -> J is less common.\n- ""VAUNT"" -> V A U N T -> V is allowed.\n\nBut note: in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was wrong, but now we are not putting A in position 3, so it\'s okay.\n\nWe also have words like:\n- ""LATIN"" -> L A T I N -> 1:L, 2:A, 3:T, 4:I, 5:N -> but position 4 is I, not N. So no.\n- ""RABIN"" -> but R is forbidden.\n\nAnother set: words ending with ""AND"" but we need the fourth to be N, so not.\n\nOr words like ""PLAIN"" but P is forbidden and position 4 is not N.\n\nSo, the candidates are: DAUNT, FAUNA, GAUNT, HAUNT, JAUNT, VAUNT, etc.\n\nBut we also have to consider that we don\'t know if there are duplicate letters. But that\'s okay.\n\nNow, we want to test as many new letters as possible to get information.\n\nWe have not used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z.\n\nCommon letters: T, L, D, M, O, U, etc.\n\nIn the words above, DAUNT, FAUNA, GAUNT, HAUNT, VAUNT all have U and T (except FAUNA has A again).\n\nFAUNA has F and U, but the fifth letter is A, which we already know. So it might not give new information about another letter.\n\nSimilarly, DAUNT has D, U, T.\n\nWe could choose a word that has a vowel in the fifth position to test for vowels? We know E is out, so other vowels are I, O, U.\n\nU is in many of these words.\n\nAnother word: ""MANGY"" -> M A N G Y -> but position 4 is G? No.\n\n""BALDY"" -> B A L D Y -> position 4 is D, not N.\n\nWe need to stick to the pattern.\n\nAnother possibility: ""TAINT"" -> T A I N T -> 1:T, 2:A, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T -> this fits: position 4 is N? 1:T, 2:A, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T -> yes! And T is not forbidden? T is not in the forbidden list (C,R,E,P,W,S are forbidden, T is okay).\n\nBut ""TAINT"" has two T\'s? That\'s possible.\n\nAlso, it tests T and I.\n\nBut we have to avoid S, which we are.\n\nSimilarly, ""PAINT"" but P is forbidden.\n\n""SAINT"" has S, forbidden.\n\n""FAINT"" -> F A I N T -> 1:F, 2:A, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T -> this also fits, and F, I, T are new.\n\nSimilarly, ""GAIN"" is 4 letters.\n\n""RAINY"" has R, forbidden.\n\nSo, options: DAUNT (D,A,U,N,T), FAUNA (F,A,U,N,A), FAINT (F,A,I,N,T), TAINT (T,A,I,N,T), etc.\n\nNow, to maximize information, we might avoid repeating letters if possible. FAUNA has two A\'s, which might not be efficient. TAINT has two T\'s.\n\nFAINT has all distinct except we know A and N are already in, but F, I, T are new and distinct.\n\nSimilarly, DAUNT has D, U, T, all new and distinct (A and N known).\n\nBut in DAUNT, the fifth letter is T, which is a consonant. We might want to test a vowel in the fifth position? But not necessary.\n\nWe could also consider ""HAVIN"" but not a word, or ""BAKIN"" not standard.\n\n""MAINS"" has S, forbidden.\n\nAnother word: ""LAVIN"" not common.\n\nI think FAINT is a good choice: it tests F, I, and T, and has the pattern with A in 2nd and N in 4th.\n\nSimilarly, ""JOINT"" but J is less common and O? J A O N T? No, pattern: J A ? N T, but third letter must be O? ""JOINT"" is J O I N T -> not A in second.\n\nWe need A in second.\n\nSo, back to FAINT: F A I N T.\n\nThis will tell us about F, I, and T.\n\nIf we get feedback, we can narrow down.\n\nSimilarly, we could do ""DAINT"" but not a common word? ""DAINT"" is not standard, usually ""dainty"" but that\'s 6 letters.\n\nSo, FAINT is valid.\n\nAnother option: ""GAUNT"" is valid, but it has U instead of I.\n\nWe don\'t know if the word has I or U or O.\n\nTo cover more vowels, I might choose FAINT to test I.\n\nBut let\'s see the frequency.\n\nWe could also choose a word with O, like ""OCTAN"" but O C T A N -> C is forbidden, and pattern not matching.\n\n""MANOR"" has R and not matching pattern.\n\nI think FAINT is a solid choice.\n\nBut note: in FAINT, the fifth letter is T, which is a common consonant.\n\nWe could do ""MAINS"" but S is forbidden.\n\n""BAILS"" has S.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with FAINT.\n\nBut let\'s confirm: F is allowed, A is known in position 2, I is new, N known in 4, T new.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, guess: FAINT.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(not in word), R(not in word), A(in word but wrong position), N(correct position), E(not in word).  \n- **Guess 2: PAWNS** → Feedback: P(not in word), A(correct position), W(not in word), N(correct position), S(not in word).\n\n### Key Insights:\n- **Position 2 is A** (confirmed by Guess 2).\n- **Position 4 is N** (confirmed by both guesses).\n- **Excluded letters**: C, R, E, P, W, S (not in the word).\n- **Pattern**: The word must follow `_ A _ N _`.\n- **Remaining positions to solve**: 1st, 3rd, and 5th letters.\n- **Available letters**: All letters except excluded ones (C, R, E, P, W, S). Focus on common letters like D, F, G, H, I, L, M, O, T, U, V, Y.\n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- Test high-frequency consonants (e.g., T, L, D) and vowels (e.g., I, O, U) in positions 1, 3, and 5.\n- Prioritize words with distinct new letters to maximize information.\n- Avoid repeating known incorrect letters or positions (e.g., A cannot be in position 3).\n\nSelected word: **FAINT**  \n- Fits the pattern `_ A _ N _` (A in position 2, N in position 4).\n- Tests new common letters: \n  - **F** in position 1 (common consonant).\n  - **I** in position 3 (vowel not yet tested).\n  - **T** in position 5 (high-frequency consonant).\n- Avoids excluded letters and repeats.\n\nThis guess will provide feedback on F, I, and T, helping to narrow down the remaining letters and positions.\n\n<guess>FAINT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: PAWNS -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) W(x) N(✓) S(x)\nGuess 3: FAINT -> FEEDBACK: F(x) A(✓) I(x) N(✓) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: CRANE\n- C: x → not in word\n- R: x → not in word\n- A: - → in word but wrong position (was in position 3)\n- N: ✓ → correct and in position\n- E: x → not in word\n\nGuess 2: PAWNS\n- P: x → not in word\n- A: ✓ → correct and in position 2\n- W: x → not in word\n- N: ✓ → correct and in position 4 (already known)\n- S: x → not in word\n\nGuess 3: FAINT\n- F: x → not in word\n- A: ✓ → correct and in position 2 (already known)\n- I: x → not in word\n- N: ✓ → correct and in position 4 (already known)\n- T: x → not in word\n\nThus, we know the following:\n\n1. Positions:\n   - Position 2: A\n   - Position 4: N\n\n2. Excluded letters (not in the word at all):\n   C, R, E, P, W, S, F, I, T\n\n3. The remaining word pattern is: _ A _ N _\n\nWe need to fill positions 1, 3, and 5 with letters not in the excluded list.\n\nExcluded letters: C, E, F, I, P, R, S, T, W\n\nSo available letters:\nA, B, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z\n\nBut note: from Guess 1, we had A classified as in the word but wrong position. At that time, it was in position 3. Now we know A is fixed in position 2. Therefore, the A in the word is accounted for by this fixed position. That means there might be no other A? Or could there be duplicate A? The feedback from Guess 1 indicated A was present but not in position 3. Now with A fixed at position 2, it\'s possible the word has only one A. However, duplicates are allowed, so we cannot rule out another A. But in position 5, for example.\n\nBut to be efficient, we might use other vowels or common consonants.\n\nNow, the pattern: ?1 A ?3 N ?5\n\nWe also know from the first guess that A was in position 3 and marked wrong, so position 3 cannot be A? Actually, we now know position 2 is A, so the A in position 3 in the first guess must be the letter from position 2 that was misplaced? But no: wait, the word has A, so having A in position 3 in CRANE was incorrect only if position 3 is not A? But now we see position 2 is A, so the A in CRANE at position 3 was wrong because A belongs at position 2. Thus, the word has only one A? Or if there is another A, it might be in another position? The feedback doesn\'t rule out duplicate A. But to simplify, we can proceed without assuming duplication for now.\n\nFor position 3, we can try other vowels: O, U, Y or consonants.\n\nWe have not tested: B, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z\n\nCommon choices: try vowels in position 3 and common consonants for positions 1 and 5.\n\nPossible words:\n\nEndings: Since position 4 is N, common words ending in N: like ?A?N?.\n\nExamples:\n- BA: ?3 could be U, L, R (R excluded) → not\n- DA: DA?N? → DAUNT we thought before, but U and T? T excluded\nDAUNT has D,A,U,N,T → T is excluded now (from FAINT feedback, T is not in word). But U is not excluded? U hasn\'t been excluded.\n\nBut TAINT, FAINT had T excluded? Yes.\n\nIn FAINT feedback, T is x, so not in word.\n\nTherefore, T is excluded.\n\nSimilarly, DAUNT: D, A, U, N, T → but T is excluded, so we cannot have T? Unless we find a word without T.\n\nNow, without T.\n\nWhat words fit _ A _ N _ ?\n\nFor example:\n- ""DANDY"" → D A N D Y → but position 3 is N? 1:D, 2:A, 3:N, 4:D, 5:Y → position 4 is D, not N → no\n- ""LANKY"" → L A N K Y → 3:N? 1:L,2:A,3:N,4:K,5:Y → position 4 is K, not N → no\n- ""MANLY"" → M A N L Y → 3:N? 1:M,2:A,3:N,4:L,5:Y → position 4 is L, not N → no\n- ""BANJO"" → B A N J O → 3:N? 1:B,2:A,3:N,4:J,5:O → position 4 is J? Not N → no\n\nWe need position 4 to be N, so ?3 can be any letter? Then N at position 4.\n\nSo words like:\n- ""DAU N ?"" → but 5th must be provided, e.g., ""DAUNT"" but T not allowed\n\nWithout T.\n\n""GAUNG"" not word\n\n""HAU N ?"" → ""HAUNT"" has T excluded\n\n""MAU N ?"" → ""MAUND"" → M A U N D → 1:M,2:A,3:U,4:N,5:D → this fits! And D, M, U? Not excluded.\n\nSimilarly, ""FAUND"" not a word\n\n""VAUNT"" has T excluded\n\n""JAUNT"" has T excluded\n\n""LAUND"" not common\n\n""YAUND"" not word\n\nBut ""MANOR"" has R excluded and not N at 4\n\n""BAG N ?"" → ""BAGGY"" not N at 4\n\nAnother possibility: ""MAG N ?"" → ""MAGUN"" not word\n\nOr ""HANDY"" has H A N D Y → position 4 is D? Not N\n\nWe need the 4th position to be N.\n\nSo the pattern is: ?1 A ?3 N ?5\n\nExamples:\n- ""BALUN"" → not common word\n- ""CALYX"" → C excluded\n- ""DAMAN"" → D A M A N → 1:D,2:A,3:M,4:A,5:N → position 4 is A? Not N → no\n\n""LAMIN"" → L A M I N → 1:L,2:A,3:M,4:I,5:N → position 4 is I? Not N → no\n\n""TAWNY"" but W and T excluded\n\nConsider: ""GAUMY"" → G A U M Y → 1:G,2:A,3:U,4:M,5:Y → position 4 is M? Not N → no\n\nHow about ""KAON"" is 4 letters\n\n""MAVIN"" → M A V I N → 1:M,2:A,3:V,4:I,5:N → again position 4 is I? Not N → no\n\nWe must have position 4 as N, so the word is ... N ?\n\nPerhaps words ending with N? But then position 5 is blank? It has to be a 5-letter word.\n\nPosition 5 can be any letter.\n\nFor example, ""DAVIN"" not word.\n\nAnother idea: ""RAJAN"" has R excluded.\n\nPerhaps ""BAYAN"" → B A Y A N → 1:B,2:A,3:Y,4:A,5:N → position 4 is A? Not N → no\n\nI see a pattern: many words put the N later or earlier.\n\nLet\'s think of common words with A in 2nd, N in 4th.\n\nExample: ""BAD N ?"" → not\n\n""SAXON"" has S excluded and S in first? Position 1:S,2:A,3:X,4:O,5:N → position 4 is O? Not N → no\n\n""TAKEN"" has T excluded and position 4? T A K E N → 1:T,2:A,3:K,4:E,5:N → position 4 is E? Not N → no\n\nPerhaps ""JAI?N"" → ""JALAN"" not common\n\nAnother word: ""CABIN"" has C excluded and not N at 4\n\nWait, perhaps I missed: ""FAGIN"" but F excluded and not N at 4? F A G I N -> position 4 I\n\n""LAR N ?"" not\n\n""MARNS"" has S and R excluded\n\nOh, ""OAKEN"" has E excluded? E in ""OAKEN"" O A K E N -> position 4 E, not N; and E excluded.\n\nPerhaps ""QUA N ?"" → ""QUAND"" → Q U A N D? Doesn\'t fit pattern; we need A in second? No, QUAND: Q U A N D -> positions: 1:Q,2:U,3:A,4:N,5:D → we have A at position 3? But pattern requires A at position 2? Our word has A in position 2.\n\nTo have A at position 2, the first letter must be one letter, then A.\n\nSo ""QUA"" is not helpful.\n\n"" YACHT"" has C and T excluded, not matching pattern.\n\nI think I am missing: ""DAH N ?""\n\nPerhaps: ""DAHL N"" not a word.\n\nBut ""DAVEN"" → D A V E N -> E excluded? E is excluded.\n\nD A V E N -> position 4 E? And E out.\n\n""NAVAN"" -> N A V A N -> 1:N,2:A,3:V,4:A,5:N -> position 4 is A? Not N.\n\n""PAVAN"" has P excluded.\n\nAnother common word: ""KAYAK"" not pattern.\n\nWe need to consider the possibility of our previous candidate ""MAUND"". I think ""MAUND"" is a word meaning a unit of weight or a basket? Valid.\n\nMAUND: M A U N D -> positions: 1:M, 2:A, 3:U, 4:N, 5:D\n\nYes, pattern _ A _ N _ with A in 2nd, N in 4th.\n\nLetters M, U, D are not excluded.\n\nSimilarly, ""DAUND"" not word.\n\n""GAUND"" not common.\n\nOr ""HAUND"" variant of ""hound""?

We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: x → not in word
- R: x → not in word
- A: - → in word but wrong position (was in position 3)
- N: ✓ → correct and in position 4
- E: x → not word

Guess 2: PAWNS
- P: x → not in word
- A: ✓ → correct and in position 2
- W: x → not in word
- N: ✓ → correct and in position 4
- S: x → not in word

Guess 3: FAINT
- F: x → not in word
- A: ✓ → correct and in position 2
- I: x → not in word
- N: ✓ → correct and in position 4
- T: x → not in word

Guess 4: MAUND
- M: x → not in word
- A: ✓ → correct and in position 2 (already known)
- U: x → not in word
- N: ✓ → correct and in position 4 (already known)
- D: x → not in word

Now, we know:

- Position 2: A (fixed)
- Position 4: N (fixed)

- Excluded letters (not in word at all): 
  From all feedback: C, E, F, I, P, R, S, T, W, M, U, D

So excluded: C, D, E, F, I, M, P, R, S, T, U, W

Available letters: A, B, G, H, J, K, L, O, Q, V, X, Y, Z (and N is fixed at position 4, but is already used)

But note: A is already in position 2, and we know it's in the word, so the only available positions are 1, 3, and 5. Since A is already placed, we mustn't put A elsewhere unless necessary? But the pattern allows for duplicate A? However, we don't know.

But to save guesses, we should avoid duplicating A unless we have to.

Pattern: _ A _ N _

Excluded list: C, D, E, F, I, M, P, R, S, T, U, W

We haven't tested many letters: B, G, H, J, K, L, O, Q, V, X, Y, Z

Common letters: B, G, H, K, L, O, V, Y

Now, we need to choose a word that fits the pattern and uses available letters.

Possible words:

First, position 3 could be a vowel like O or a consonant.

Position 1 and 5: consonants.

Examples:

- ""BAG N ?"" → ""BAGGY"" not N at 4

Pattern is ?1 A ?3 N ?5

So ?1: B, G, H, K, L, O, Q, V, X, Y, Z
?3: same set
?5: same set

But must form a valid word.

""BA? N ?"" 

""BAL N ?"" → ""BALMY"" B A L M Y -> but M excluded? M is in the excluded list? From MAUND, M is x.

Excluded includes M.

Similarly U and D are excluded.

So avoid those.

What words: ""BAL N O"" → ""BALUN"" not common.

""YAK N ?"" → ""YAKAN"" not common

""GAL N ?"" → ""GALL"" not 5 letters

""GAU"" not

Perhaps ""VA   "" → ""VAULT"" U excluded

""OAK N"" → not pattern

""HA  "" → ""HAVEN"" E and N position? H A V E N -> positions: 1:H,2:A,3:V,4:E,5:N -> position 4 is E? Not N -> no

We need N at position 4.

So it has to be word with A at 2, N at 4.

""LA  "" → ""LAM N"" → ""LAMIN"" L A M I N -> M excluded already, position 4 I not N

Perhaps ""JAG N"" → ""JAGGY"" not N at4

""JAGUAR"" 6 letters

Another idea: ""KAY N ?"" → ""KAYAK"" K A Y A K -> positions: 1:K,2:A,3:Y,4:A,5:K -> position 4 is A, not N

""BAYO N"" → ""BAYON"" B A Y O N -> 1:B,2:A,3:Y,4:O,5:N -> position 4 O not N

""BASON"" S excluded

""CANON"" C and N at wrong position

Perhaps ""B AND"" not.

Let's think of common words like: ""OAK N"" not

""OASIS"" excluded

""VAL N ?"" → ""VALOR"" V A L O R -> positions: 1:V,2:A,3:L,4:O,5:R -> position 4 O not N, and R excluded -> no

""HAVL"" not

""QAM  "" not

""XAN A"" → ""XENON"" E excluded, and X E N O N -> position 4 O not N

""XANTH"" not N at end

Perhaps we are missing: ""HONEY"" not pattern

Another possibility: ""LAB N ?"" → ""LABAN"" L A B A N -> 1:L,2:A,3:B,4:A,5:N -> position 4 is A, not N -> no

""NABLA"" N A B L A -> position 1 N? We don't know, but position 2 A,3:B,4:L,5:A -> position 4 L not N

Let's list possible words ending with N? But position 5 could be without N.

Position 5 is open.

But with available letters.

For example: ""BA   N"" → for position 3, then position 5

Like B A ?3 N ?5

?3 and ?5.

With available letters: B,G,H,K,L,O,Q,V,X,Y,Z

Possible combinations:

If ?3 L, ?5 O → ""BAL N O"" not word

?3 G, ?5 H → ""BAG N H"" not

?3 G, ?5 O → ""BAGON"" not common

""GAGON"" G A G O N -> 1:G,2:A,3:G,4:O,5:N -> position 4 O not N

""JAGON"" not

""VAGON"" not and V A G O N pattern not N at4

Another word: ""CROON"" excluded C

""BROON"" B R O O N -> R excluded

""BLOON"" B L O O N -> 1:B,2:L,3:O,4:O,5:N -> not A at2

We need A at position 2.

So the word must have the second letter A.

Perhaps ""KANA "" not 5

""LA   "" but then position 2 A? L is position 1, A at2

L A ?3 N ?5

For example: ""LAV N ?"" → V excluded? V is not excluded? Excluded list: C,D,E,F,I,M,P,R,S,T,U,W — V is not in the list.

V is available!

Similarly, O, G, etc.

L A V N ?5

?5 must be a letter.

""LAV N ?"" → ""LAVON"" not common

"" Latin"" but T not allowed

""LOV N"" not

""GAV N"" → ""GAVON"" not

""HAV N"" → ""HAVEN"" E excluded

""HAVOC"" C not and position

H A V O C -> position 4 O not N

But C excluded.

""VAV N"" → ""VAVO N"" not

Another idea: ""YARN"" not 5

""YAH N ?"" → ""YAHAN"" Y A H A N -> position 4 A not N

Y A H N ?5

For example: ""YA H N A"" -> ""YAHNA"" not common

""YAC N"" C excluded

Perhaps ""ZAL N"" → ""ZALON"" Z A L O N -> 1:Z,2:A,3:L,4:O,5:N -> position 4 O not N

Oh, position 4 must be N, so only the fifth letter can be different.

So pattern: ?1 A ?3 N ?5

For ""LAV  "" with N at 4 is not possible.

"" B A G N ?"" ""BAGN"" not

""K A G ?N"" not

I found a word: ""BAH N A"" not

Perhaps ""JAM N in"" not

""OAM N"" not

Another possibility: ""G A O N ?"" → ""GAON"" is 4 letters, ""GAONG"" not word

""KA O N G"" not

Perhaps ""QANAT"" Q A N A T -> positions: 1:Q,2:A,3:N,4:A,5:T -> position 3 is N? But position 4 is A, not N -> no

But in this, N is at position 3.

We need N at position 4.

So for N to be at position 4, position 3 cannot be N? Or it can? But we have to have a letter at position 3.

Like if position 3 is Y, then "" Y A Y N ?"" not

"" A Y N ?"" position 2 A, so "" A"" for position1.

For example: ""BAY N ?"" → ""BAYON"" B A Y O N -> position 4 O not N

""BAYAD"" B A Y A D -> position 4 A not N

""BAYLE"" E excluded

""GAYLY"" G A Y L Y -> position 4 L not N

Not.

Perhaps ""WAY"" not

Or ""O A K N ?"" ""OAKEN"" E excluded

""O A L N ?"" ""OAL N"" not

""O A V N ?"" ""OAV N"" not

Perhaps we need to consider less common letters.

Or maybe ""Y A L N ?"" ""YAL  "" not

""YALD"" not 5

""Y A G N ?"" ""YAGAN"" Y A G A N -> position 4 A not N

"" H A G N ?"" ""HAGIN"" H A G I N -> position 4 I not N

But I excluded? From FAINT, I is not in word.

So cannot.

"" J A G N ?"" ""JAGER"" E excluded

I think we are struggling.

Another word: ""VAK N L"" not

Perhaps ""QIBLA"" Q I B L A -> not pattern

Let's think: ""ABAND"" not fit pattern.

Perhaps the word has duplicates.

For example, ""L A N A N"" but not standard.

""B A N A N"" is 6 letters.

""ANANA"" A N A N A -> not position 2 A.

Not.

It's possible that position 3 is B, position 5 is G, but ""BAB N G"" not word.

Perhaps ""KAB N G"" not.

I recall that ""NAB K"" not.

Another common word: ""BAGGY"" not have N.

Wait, ""BEGAN"" B E G A N -> E excluded, and position 4 A not N.

No.

Perhaps we missed a word: ""DAILY"" D excluded, not N.

""BARNY"" R excluded.

""BALKY"" L A L K Y -> position 4 K not N, and pattern? 1:B,2:A,3:L,4:K,5:Y -> position 4 K.

Not N.

Always not position 4 N? But we know position 4 is N for sure.

So what are the words that have A in position 2 and N in position 4?

Examples: 
- ""TAINT"" but T excluded
- ""FAINT"" F and T excluded
- ""GAUNT"" G A U N T -> T excluded, U excluded ( from MAUND U x)
- ""HAUNT"" H A U N T -> U and T excluded
- ""JAUNT"" J A U N T -> U, T excluded
- ""VAUNT"" V A U N T -> U, T excluded
- ""DAUNT"" D A U N T -> D, U, T excluded
- ""PAINT"" P excluded

Now with available letters: G, H, J, K, L, O, V, Y

"" a G N  "" → ""AGENE"" E excluded, and not position 4 N

"" G A G N ?"" not

""V A G N ?"" ""VAGUS"" S excluded, position? V A G U S -> position 4 U not N

"" O A G N ?"" ""OAGAN"" not

""L A G N ?"" ""LAGAN"" L A G A N -> position 4 A not N

""Y A G N ?"" ""YAGAN"" 5th N? Y A G A N -> position 4 A, not N

""Z A G N ?"" ""ZAGAN"" not common

""   A K N  "" 
""BAK N"" ""BAKEN"" E excluded

""HAK N"" ""HAKIM"" I excluded

""JAK N"" ""JAKES"" S and E excluded

""KAK n"" ""KAKAN"" K A K A N -> position 4 A not N

""L  a K N"" ""LAKIN"" L A K I N -> position 4 I not N

""MAK N"" M excluded

""NAK N"" N A K ? N not pattern

""RAK N"" R excluded

""SAK N"" S excluded

""TAK N"" T excluded

""VAK N"" ""VAKIL"" not have N at4? V A K I L -> no

""YAK N"" ""YAKAN"" Y A K A N -> position 4 A not N

So, with 'K', hard to finish.

Other letters: "" L A V N ?"" Lav or ""lav an"" not

""HAV N"" ""HAVEN"" not

""G A V N ?"" ""GAVial"" 6 letters

Perhaps ""O A V N ?"" ""OAVES"" S excluded

I think we need to try ""BAG N E"" E excluded.

Or perhaps the word is ""BANYA"" B A N Y A -> B A N Y A -> 1:B,2:A,3:N,4:Y,5:A -> position 4 Y, not N.

Not.

Unless the position 3 is N? Then position 4 would not be N? But we know position 4 is N, so position 3 must be a different letter.

For example, "" X A N N Y"" would have position 3 N and position 4 N, but ""XANNY"" not word.

Or ""B A N N Y"" But then positions: 1:B,2:A,3:N,4:N,5:Y -> position 4 is N, position 3 is N, so two N's. Is that possible?

If ""BANNY"" is a word? It might be a proper name or slang, but in word games, ""BANNY"" is not standard.

""CANNY"" C excluded.

""HANNY"" not common.

""MANNY"" M excluded.

""NANNY"" N A N N Y -> positions: 1:N,2:A,3:N,4:N,5:Y -> position 4 is N, position 3 is N.

But N at position 3 and position 4? The feedback might show both correct? But we have not seen any indication of duplicate letters.

But ""NANNY"" has three N's? Positions 1:N? but not necessarily.

InNANNY: 1:N,2:A,3:N,4:N,5:Y -> so position3 and4 both N.

Possible? Yes.

But is ""NANNY"" a valid word? Yes, informal for nanny or nursemaid.

Also, in the feedback, for first guess CRANE with A at position 3, we got a dash, meaning A is in word but not position 3. But N at position 4 is correct.

In ""NANNY"", the letters are N,A,N,N,Y.

A is at position 2, which matches what we have.

Now, for the fourth position, N is there.

But we have used N at position 1 and 3 as well.

But available letters: N is not excluded, and we know it's in the word.

Also, for guess 4 MAUND: M A U N D -> all except A and N were marked x, including U and D.

So for ""NANNY"", it has N, A, N, N, Y.

Y not tested.

Also, position 1: N, which we don't know yet.

Position 3: N, and position 4: N, so duplicate N.

Position 5: Y.

Excluded letters include only C,D,E,F,I,M,P,R,S,T,U,W, so Y and N are allowed.

Similarly, position 1 N is not tested as a first letter.

Could work.

Another word ""VANNY"" not common.

""YANNY"" Y A N N Y -> position 4 N, yes.

But ""YANNY"" is a word? Sound term.

But both possible.

Or ""LANNY"" not common.

But ""BANNY"" is less common.

Perhaps ""ANN N"" not.

I think ""NANNY"" is a reasonable guess.

Also, it tests the first letter N and fifth letter Y, and we already know position 2 A and position 4 N.

So, let's try ""NANNY"".

The pattern matches: N A N N Y -> positions: 1:N,2:A,3:N,4:N,5:Y

Position 4 is N, which is correct.

Position 2 is A, correct.

First position N: not known.

Position 3 N: also N.

Position 5 Y.

If we guess ""NANNY"" and the word is ""NANNY"", it will show all correct.

But if the word is different, we might get feedback.

Since we have few options, and only 2 tries left (6 total, used 4).

We can try.

Another possibility: ""H  A V N L"" not.

So, I'll go with NANNY.
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Feedback from Previous Guesses**:
   - **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(✓), E(x)
     - N is in position 4 and correct (✓).
     - A is in the word but not in position 3 (-).
     - C, R, and E are not in the word (x).
   - **Guess 2: PAWNS** → Feedback: P(x), A(✓), W(x), N(✓), S(x)
     - A is in position 2 and correct (✓).
     - N is in position 4 and correct (✓).
     - P, W, and S are not in the word (x).
   - **Guess 3: FAINT** → Feedback: F(x), A(✓), I(x), N(✓), T(x)
     - A in position 2 and N in position 4 confirmed (✓).
     - F, I, and T are not in the word (x).
   - **Guess 4: MAUND** → Feedback: M(x), A✓, U(x), N✓, D(x)
     - A in position 2 and N in position 4 confirmed (✓).
     - M, U, and D are not in the word (x).

2. **Key Insights from Feedback**:
   - **Fixed Positions**:
     - Position 2 is **A**.
     - Position 4 is **N**.
     - The pattern is: `? A ? N ?` (positions 1, 3, and 5 unknown).
   - **Excluded Letters** (not in the word at all):
     - C, E, F, I, M, P, R, S, T, U, W, D (from all feedback).
   - **Available Letters** (not tested or excluded):
     - B, G, H, J, K, L, O, Q, V, X, Y, Z (and known A, N are fixed but may have duplicates).
   - **Constraints**:
     - Position 3 cannot be A (from Guess 1 feedback: A not in position 3).
     - Position 3 also cannot be any excluded letter.
     - The guess must be a valid English word fitting `? A ? N ?`.

3. **Strategy for Guess 5**:
   - **Goal**: Test new letters in positions 1, 3, and 5 to narrow possibilities.
   - **Priority**: Use high-frequency available letters (e.g., L, O, G, V, Y) to maximize information.
   - **Pattern Consideration**: With many letters excluded, words fitting `? A ? N ?` are rare. Possible candidates:
     - **NANNY**: Tests N in position 1 (untested), N in position 3 (new position), and Y in position 5 (new letter). All letters (N, A, N, N, Y) are available or fixed. ""NANNY"" is a valid word (informal for a nursemaid).
   - **Rationale for NANNY**:
     - Tests for duplicate N (possible since N is already in position 4).
     - Covers Y, a common letter not yet tested.
     - If incorrect, feedback on positions 1, 3, and 5 will be highly informative (e.g., ✓ if correct, x/- otherwise).
     - Only 2 guesses left (out of 6), so this guess balances risk and information gain.

4. **Verification**:
   - Excluded: C, D, E, F, I, M, P, R, S, T, U, W.
   - Guess uses: N (known in position 4, but positioned at 1 and 3 too), A (fixed at position 2), Y (untested). 
   - ""NANNY"" is in the word list (e.g., Scrabble/OED accepted).

<guess>NANNY</guess>",NANNY,"We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: x → not in word
- R: x → not in word
- A: - → in word but wrong position (was in position 3)
- N: ✓ → correct and in position 4
- E: x → not word

Guess 2: PAWNS
- P: x → not in word
- A: ✓ → correct and in position 2
- W: x → not in word
- N: ✓ → correct and in position 4
- S: x → not in word

Guess 3: FAINT
- F: x → not in word
- A: ✓ → correct and in position 2
- I: x → not in word
- N: ✓ → correct and in position 4
- T: x → not in word

Guess 4: MAUND
- M: x → not in word
- A: ✓ → correct and in position 2 (already known)
- U: x → not in word
- N: ✓ → correct and in position 4 (already known)
- D: x → not in word

Now, we know:

- Position 2: A (fixed)
- Position 4: N (fixed)

- Excluded letters (not in word at all): 
  From all feedback: C, E, F, I, P, R, S, T, W, M, U, D

So excluded: C, D, E, F, I, M, P, R, S, T, U, W

Available letters: A, B, G, H, J, K, L, O, Q, V, X, Y, Z (and N is fixed at position 4, but is already used)

But note: A is already in position 2, and we know it's in the word, so the only available positions are 1, 3, and 5. Since A is already placed, we mustn't put A elsewhere unless necessary? But the pattern allows for duplicate A? However, we don't know.

But to save guesses, we should avoid duplicating A unless we have to.

Pattern: _ A _ N _

Excluded list: C, D, E, F, I, M, P, R, S, T, U, W

We haven't tested many letters: B, G, H, J, K, L, O, Q, V, X, Y, Z

Common letters: B, G, H, K, L, O, V, Y

Now, we need to choose a word that fits the pattern and uses available letters.

Possible words:

First, position 3 could be a vowel like O or a consonant.

Position 1 and 5: consonants.

Examples:

- ""BAG N ?"" → ""BAGGY"" not N at 4

Pattern is ?1 A ?3 N ?5

So ?1: B, G, H, K, L, O, Q, V, X, Y, Z
?3: same set
?5: same set

But must form a valid word.

""BA? N ?"" 

""BAL N ?"" → ""BALMY"" B A L M Y -> but M excluded? M is in the excluded list? From MAUND, M is x.

Excluded includes M.

Similarly U and D are excluded.

So avoid those.

What words: ""BAL N O"" → ""BALUN"" not common.

""YAK N ?"" → ""YAKAN"" not common

""GAL N ?"" → ""GALL"" not 5 letters

""GAU"" not

Perhaps ""VA   "" → ""VAULT"" U excluded

""OAK N"" → not pattern

""HA  "" → ""HAVEN"" E and N position? H A V E N -> positions: 1:H,2:A,3:V,4:E,5:N -> position 4 is E? Not N -> no

We need N at position 4.

So it has to be word with A at 2, N at 4.

""LA  "" → ""LAM N"" → ""LAMIN"" L A M I N -> M excluded already, position 4 I not N

Perhaps ""JAG N"" → ""JAGGY"" not N at4

""JAGUAR"" 6 letters

Another idea: ""KAY N ?"" → ""KAYAK"" K A Y A K -> positions: 1:K,2:A,3:Y,4:A,5:K -> position 4 is A, not N

""BAYO N"" → ""BAYON"" B A Y O N -> 1:B,2:A,3:Y,4:O,5:N -> position 4 O not N

""BASON"" S excluded

""CANON"" C and N at wrong position

Perhaps ""B AND"" not.

Let's think of common words like: ""OAK N"" not

""OASIS"" excluded

""VAL N ?"" → ""VALOR"" V A L O R -> positions: 1:V,2:A,3:L,4:O,5:R -> position 4 O not N, and R excluded -> no

""HAVL"" not

""QAM  "" not

""XAN A"" → ""XENON"" E excluded, and X E N O N -> position 4 O not N

""XANTH"" not N at end

Perhaps we are missing: ""HONEY"" not pattern

Another possibility: ""LAB N ?"" → ""LABAN"" L A B A N -> 1:L,2:A,3:B,4:A,5:N -> position 4 is A, not N -> no

""NABLA"" N A B L A -> position 1 N? We don't know, but position 2 A,3:B,4:L,5:A -> position 4 L not N

Let's list possible words ending with N? But position 5 could be without N.

Position 5 is open.

But with available letters.

For example: ""BA   N"" → for position 3, then position 5

Like B A ?3 N ?5

?3 and ?5.

With available letters: B,G,H,K,L,O,Q,V,X,Y,Z

Possible combinations:

If ?3 L, ?5 O → ""BAL N O"" not word

?3 G, ?5 H → ""BAG N H"" not

?3 G, ?5 O → ""BAGON"" not common

""GAGON"" G A G O N -> 1:G,2:A,3:G,4:O,5:N -> position 4 O not N

""JAGON"" not

""VAGON"" not and V A G O N pattern not N at4

Another word: ""CROON"" excluded C

""BROON"" B R O O N -> R excluded

""BLOON"" B L O O N -> 1:B,2:L,3:O,4:O,5:N -> not A at2

We need A at position 2.

So the word must have the second letter A.

Perhaps ""KANA "" not 5

""LA   "" but then position 2 A? L is position 1, A at2

L A ?3 N ?5

For example: ""LAV N ?"" → V excluded? V is not excluded? Excluded list: C,D,E,F,I,M,P,R,S,T,U,W — V is not in the list.

V is available!

Similarly, O, G, etc.

L A V N ?5

?5 must be a letter.

""LAV N ?"" → ""LAVON"" not common

"" Latin"" but T not allowed

""LOV N"" not

""GAV N"" → ""GAVON"" not

""HAV N"" → ""HAVEN"" E excluded

""HAVOC"" C not and position

H A V O C -> position 4 O not N

But C excluded.

""VAV N"" → ""VAVO N"" not

Another idea: ""YARN"" not 5

""YAH N ?"" → ""YAHAN"" Y A H A N -> position 4 A not N

Y A H N ?5

For example: ""YA H N A"" -> ""YAHNA"" not common

""YAC N"" C excluded

Perhaps ""ZAL N"" → ""ZALON"" Z A L O N -> 1:Z,2:A,3:L,4:O,5:N -> position 4 O not N

Oh, position 4 must be N, so only the fifth letter can be different.

So pattern: ?1 A ?3 N ?5

For ""LAV  "" with N at 4 is not possible.

"" B A G N ?"" ""BAGN"" not

""K A G ?N"" not

I found a word: ""BAH N A"" not

Perhaps ""JAM N in"" not

""OAM N"" not

Another possibility: ""G A O N ?"" → ""GAON"" is 4 letters, ""GAONG"" not word

""KA O N G"" not

Perhaps ""QANAT"" Q A N A T -> positions: 1:Q,2:A,3:N,4:A,5:T -> position 3 is N? But position 4 is A, not N -> no

But in this, N is at position 3.

We need N at position 4.

So for N to be at position 4, position 3 cannot be N? Or it can? But we have to have a letter at position 3.

Like if position 3 is Y, then "" Y A Y N ?"" not

"" A Y N ?"" position 2 A, so "" A"" for position1.

For example: ""BAY N ?"" → ""BAYON"" B A Y O N -> position 4 O not N

""BAYAD"" B A Y A D -> position 4 A not N

""BAYLE"" E excluded

""GAYLY"" G A Y L Y -> position 4 L not N

Not.

Perhaps ""WAY"" not

Or ""O A K N ?"" ""OAKEN"" E excluded

""O A L N ?"" ""OAL N"" not

""O A V N ?"" ""OAV N"" not

Perhaps we need to consider less common letters.

Or maybe ""Y A L N ?"" ""YAL  "" not

""YALD"" not 5

""Y A G N ?"" ""YAGAN"" Y A G A N -> position 4 A not N

"" H A G N ?"" ""HAGIN"" H A G I N -> position 4 I not N

But I excluded? From FAINT, I is not in word.

So cannot.

"" J A G N ?"" ""JAGER"" E excluded

I think we are struggling.

Another word: ""VAK N L"" not

Perhaps ""QIBLA"" Q I B L A -> not pattern

Let's think: ""ABAND"" not fit pattern.

Perhaps the word has duplicates.

For example, ""L A N A N"" but not standard.

""B A N A N"" is 6 letters.

""ANANA"" A N A N A -> not position 2 A.

Not.

It's possible that position 3 is B, position 5 is G, but ""BAB N G"" not word.

Perhaps ""KAB N G"" not.

I recall that ""NAB K"" not.

Another common word: ""BAGGY"" not have N.

Wait, ""BEGAN"" B E G A N -> E excluded, and position 4 A not N.

No.

Perhaps we missed a word: ""DAILY"" D excluded, not N.

""BARNY"" R excluded.

""BALKY"" L A L K Y -> position 4 K not N, and pattern? 1:B,2:A,3:L,4:K,5:Y -> position 4 K.

Not N.

Always not position 4 N? But we know position 4 is N for sure.

So what are the words that have A in position 2 and N in position 4?

Examples: 
- ""TAINT"" but T excluded
- ""FAINT"" F and T excluded
- ""GAUNT"" G A U N T -> T excluded, U excluded ( from MAUND U x)
- ""HAUNT"" H A U N T -> U and T excluded
- ""JAUNT"" J A U N T -> U, T excluded
- ""VAUNT"" V A U N T -> U, T excluded
- ""DAUNT"" D A U N T -> D, U, T excluded
- ""PAINT"" P excluded

Now with available letters: G, H, J, K, L, O, V, Y

"" a G N  "" → ""AGENE"" E excluded, and not position 4 N

"" G A G N ?"" not

""V A G N ?"" ""VAGUS"" S excluded, position? V A G U S -> position 4 U not N

"" O A G N ?"" ""OAGAN"" not

""L A G N ?"" ""LAGAN"" L A G A N -> position 4 A not N

""Y A G N ?"" ""YAGAN"" 5th N? Y A G A N -> position 4 A, not N

""Z A G N ?"" ""ZAGAN"" not common

""   A K N  "" 
""BAK N"" ""BAKEN"" E excluded

""HAK N"" ""HAKIM"" I excluded

""JAK N"" ""JAKES"" S and E excluded

""KAK n"" ""KAKAN"" K A K A N -> position 4 A not N

""L  a K N"" ""LAKIN"" L A K I N -> position 4 I not N

""MAK N"" M excluded

""NAK N"" N A K ? N not pattern

""RAK N"" R excluded

""SAK N"" S excluded

""TAK N"" T excluded

""VAK N"" ""VAKIL"" not have N at4? V A K I L -> no

""YAK N"" ""YAKAN"" Y A K A N -> position 4 A not N

So, with 'K', hard to finish.

Other letters: "" L A V N ?"" Lav or ""lav an"" not

""HAV N"" ""HAVEN"" not

""G A V N ?"" ""GAVial"" 6 letters

Perhaps ""O A V N ?"" ""OAVES"" S excluded

I think we need to try ""BAG N E"" E excluded.

Or perhaps the word is ""BANYA"" B A N Y A -> B A N Y A -> 1:B,2:A,3:N,4:Y,5:A -> position 4 Y, not N.

Not.

Unless the position 3 is N? Then position 4 would not be N? But we know position 4 is N, so position 3 must be a different letter.

For example, "" X A N N Y"" would have position 3 N and position 4 N, but ""XANNY"" not word.

Or ""B A N N Y"" But then positions: 1:B,2:A,3:N,4:N,5:Y -> position 4 is N, position 3 is N, so two N's. Is that possible?

If ""BANNY"" is a word? It might be a proper name or slang, but in word games, ""BANNY"" is not standard.

""CANNY"" C excluded.

""HANNY"" not common.

""MANNY"" M excluded.

""NANNY"" N A N N Y -> positions: 1:N,2:A,3:N,4:N,5:Y -> position 4 is N, position 3 is N.

But N at position 3 and position 4? The feedback might show both correct? But we have not seen any indication of duplicate letters.

But ""NANNY"" has three N's? Positions 1:N? but not necessarily.

InNANNY: 1:N,2:A,3:N,4:N,5:Y -> so position3 and4 both N.

Possible? Yes.

But is ""NANNY"" a valid word? Yes, informal for nanny or nursemaid.

Also, in the feedback, for first guess CRANE with A at position 3, we got a dash, meaning A is in word but not position 3. But N at position 4 is correct.

In ""NANNY"", the letters are N,A,N,N,Y.

A is at position 2, which matches what we have.

Now, for the fourth position, N is there.

But we have used N at position 1 and 3 as well.

But available letters: N is not excluded, and we know it's in the word.

Also, for guess 4 MAUND: M A U N D -> all except A and N were marked x, including U and D.

So for ""NANNY"", it has N, A, N, N, Y.

Y not tested.

Also, position 1: N, which we don't know yet.

Position 3: N, and position 4: N, so duplicate N.

Position 5: Y.

Excluded letters include only C,D,E,F,I,M,P,R,S,T,U,W, so Y and N are allowed.

Similarly, position 1 N is not tested as a first letter.

Could work.

Another word ""VANNY"" not common.

""YANNY"" Y A N N Y -> position 4 N, yes.

But ""YANNY"" is a word? Sound term.

But both possible.

Or ""LANNY"" not common.

But ""BANNY"" is less common.

Perhaps ""ANN N"" not.

I think ""NANNY"" is a reasonable guess.

Also, it tests the first letter N and fifth letter Y, and we already know position 2 A and position 4 N.

So, let's try ""NANNY"".

The pattern matches: N A N N Y -> positions: 1:N,2:A,3:N,4:N,5:Y

Position 4 is N, which is correct.

Position 2 is A, correct.

First position N: not known.

Position 3 N: also N.

Position 5 Y.

If we guess ""NANNY"" and the word is ""NANNY"", it will show all correct.

But if the word is different, we might get feedback.

Since we have few options, and only 2 tries left (6 total, used 4).

We can try.

Another possibility: ""H  A V N L"" not.

So, I'll go with NANNY.### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Feedback from Previous Guesses**:
   - **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(✓), E(x)
     - N is in position 4 and correct (✓).
     - A is in the word but not in position 3 (-).
     - C, R, and E are not in the word (x).
   - **Guess 2: PAWNS** → Feedback: P(x), A(✓), W(x), N(✓), S(x)
     - A is in position 2 and correct (✓).
     - N is in position 4 and correct (✓).
     - P, W, and S are not in the word (x).
   - **Guess 3: FAINT** → Feedback: F(x), A(✓), I(x), N(✓), T(x)
     - A in position 2 and N in position 4 confirmed (✓).
     - F, I, and T are not in the word (x).
   - **Guess 4: MAUND** → Feedback: M(x), A✓, U(x), N✓, D(x)
     - A in position 2 and N in position 4 confirmed (✓).
     - M, U, and D are not in the word (x).

2. **Key Insights from Feedback**:
   - **Fixed Positions**:
     - Position 2 is **A**.
     - Position 4 is **N**.
     - The pattern is: `? A ? N ?` (positions 1, 3, and 5 unknown).
   - **Excluded Letters** (not in the word at all):
     - C, E, F, I, M, P, R, S, T, U, W, D (from all feedback).
   - **Available Letters** (not tested or excluded):
     - B, G, H, J, K, L, O, Q, V, X, Y, Z (and known A, N are fixed but may have duplicates).
   - **Constraints**:
     - Position 3 cannot be A (from Guess 1 feedback: A not in position 3).
     - Position 3 also cannot be any excluded letter.
     - The guess must be a valid English word fitting `? A ? N ?`.

3. **Strategy for Guess 5**:
   - **Goal**: Test new letters in positions 1, 3, and 5 to narrow possibilities.
   - **Priority**: Use high-frequency available letters (e.g., L, O, G, V, Y) to maximize information.
   - **Pattern Consideration**: With many letters excluded, words fitting `? A ? N ?` are rare. Possible candidates:
     - **NANNY**: Tests N in position 1 (untested), N in position 3 (new position), and Y in position 5 (new letter). All letters (N, A, N, N, Y) are available or fixed. ""NANNY"" is a valid word (informal for a nursemaid).
   - **Rationale for NANNY**:
     - Tests for duplicate N (possible since N is already in position 4).
     - Covers Y, a common letter not yet tested.
     - If incorrect, feedback on positions 1, 3, and 5 will be highly informative (e.g., ✓ if correct, x/- otherwise).
     - Only 2 guesses left (out of 6), so this guess balances risk and information gain.

4. **Verification**:
   - Excluded: C, D, E, F, I, M, P, R, S, T, U, W.
   - Guess uses: N (known in position 4, but positioned at 1 and 3 too), A (fixed at position 2), Y (untested). 
   - ""NANNY"" is in the word list (e.g., Scrabble/OED accepted).",Guess 5: NANNY -> FEEDBACK: N(✓) A(✓) N(✓) N(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
