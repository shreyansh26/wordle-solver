We are just starting, so we have no information about the secret word.
 The goal of the first guess is to gather as much information as possible.
 It's common to start with a word that has a lot of vowels and common consonants to maximize the chance of hitting some letters.

 Some common good starting words: ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""SOARE"", ""ROAST"", ""RAISE"", ""ADIEU"" (which has many vowels).

 I'll choose ""ADIEU"" because it contains three vowels (A, I, E, U) which can help reveal vowel positions. However, note that ""ADIEU"" is 5 letters and valid.

 Alternate: ""SOARE"" (a type of hawk) is also a good one.

 But let me stick with a very common one: ""CRANE"".

 After consideration, I think ""RAISE"" is also excellent because it contains three vowels and two common consonants.

 However, I note that the example uses ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"" which are common words.

 Since we don't have any information, I choose ""CRANE"" for its balance.

 But note: in the example, the secret word was ""BRISK"", which does not have any of the letters in ""ADIEU"" except for the vowel 'I'. So I might get more information from a word that has letters that commonly appear.

 I think I'll use ""RAISE"" because it has A, I, E (vowels) and R, S (common consonants).

 Decision: first guess ""RAISE"".

 Let me check: R, A, I, S, E.

 Format: I must output the guessed word in the specified format.

 Thought process: 
 - I want to cover common vowels and consonants.
 - ""RAISE"" includes R, A, I, S, E which are all common.

 So I'll go with ""RAISE"".
</think>
For my first guess, I chose ""RAISE"" because it offers a balanced mix of common vowels (A, I, E) and consonants (R, S). This combination helps maximize the potential for feedback on which letters are present and their possible positions, gathering valuable information efficiently. The goal is to cover high-frequency letters early to accelerate the deduction process.

We received feedback from the first guess:
Guess: RAISE → Feedback: R(✓) A(x) I(-) S(-) E(-)

Interpretation:
- R is in the word and in the correct position (first position). So the secret word starts with R.
- A is not in the word at all. So we can eliminate A.
- I is in the word but not in the third position (since we put it third and got a '-'). It could be in position 1,2,4,5? But position 1 is already taken by R, so I must be in 2,4, or 5. However, note that the first position is R and correct so I must not be first. So I is somewhere else: position 2,4, or 5.
- S is in the word but not in the fourth position. So S could be in position 1,2,3,5? But position 1 is R which is fixed, so S must be in 2,3, or 5. Also, note that I is already in position 3 (from our guess) but it was marked wrong position, so probably position 3 is not S either? Actually, no, S could be in any other position except 4.
- E is in the word but not in the fifth position. So E could be in position 1,2,3,4? Position 1 is R, so E must be in 2,3, or 4.

Summarizing:
- First letter: R (fixed).
- The secret word does not contain A at all.
- I is present, but not at position 3. Possible positions: 2,4,5.
- S is present, but not at position 4. Possible positions: 2,3,5.
- E is present, but not at position 5. Possible positions: 2,3,4.

Also, note: the word has R as first letter, and contains I, S, E, but does not contain A.

Now, we must make a second guess.

Strategy: We want to test possible positions for I, S, E and also try to include other common letters that haven't been tested yet.

In our first guess, we tested letters: R, A, I, S, E. We know A is absent, so we should avoid A. But we know I, S, E are present. Therefore, in the second guess, we can try to place I, S, E in different positions to narrow down their locations.

Important: We must keep R in the first position since we know it's correct? Not necessarily. The feedback doesn't require that we keep the correct letters in the same spot in subsequent guesses? Actually, we can move them to test positions. But note: the feedback will tell us about the letter positions independently.

However, we might want to keep the known correct letter (R) in position to not ""waste"" a letter slot? Or we can try moving it to test other letters?

But R is fixed at the first position, so in the secret word, R is always at start. So in our guesses, we can keep R at first to build on that.

So let's keep R as the first letter.

Therefore, second word must start with R.

Now, we need a word that:
- Starts with R.
- Does not contain A (since A is absent).
- Contains I, S, E (but knowing we can't have them in the positions they were in the first guess: so I not in position 3? Actually, we can try I again in a different position? But note, we already know I is in the word, so we can reuse it? Actually, we can use any letters, as long as we form a valid word.

But we want to test positions for I, S, E.

Specifically:
- Position 2: could be I? or E? or S? or a new letter?
- Position 3: we don't know, but cannot be I (from feedback? wait: in guess1, I was at position 3 and it was marked wrong position, meaning that it is not there in the secret word? So position 3 is not I. Similarly, position 4 is not S, and position 5 is not E.

So:
- Position 3 ≠ I
- Position 4 ≠ S
- Position 5 ≠ E

But for our next guess, we can put I in other positions: 2,4,5? But we have R fixed at position 1.

Let's think of words starting with R that contain I, S, E? But note: S must be in the word and not at position 4, E must be in the word and not at position 5, I must be in the word and not at position 3.

Possible words? We have to form a 5-letter word.

Also, remember the secret word has these letters: R (pos1), I, S, E, and one more letter we don't know (because we have 4 letters identified and one unknown? Actually, in the secret word, we know it has R, I, S, E. That's four, so there is one more letter).

We don't know if the secret word has repeated letters, but we should avoid repeating letters for now to avoid confusion? Unless we have reason to suspect repetition.

But in the first guess, we had five distinct letters: R,A,I,S,E. We only know that I,S,E appear, R appears at start, and A is absent. So the secret word must have R, I, S, E, and one other letter (could be a duplicate? but let's assume no duplication until we get duplicate feedback? Actually, we don't know).

Now, let's try to form a second guess:

Constraints:
- Start with R
- Include I (but not in position 3? Actually, in this guess we can put I in position 2,4, or 5? But we need to avoid the known wrong positions only for the secret word? Not for our guess? We are free to put I anywhere? Actually, yes, we can put I in position 3 again? But that would give us no new information? So better not.

So avoid putting I in position 3 because we know it's not there? Similarly, avoid S in position 4? Avoid E in position 5.

So for the second guess, we'll try to put I in position 2 or 4 or 5? Similarly for S and E? But we also have to include them all.

But we have five positions: 
Position 1: R (fixed)
Position 2: we can put a new letter? Or moving E, I, S? Actually, we must form a valid word.

Some ideas:

Option: try I in position 2? Then S and E in other positions? But S cannot be in 4? So S could be in 2 (but if we put I at 2, then S can be 3 or 5? but S was already tried at 4 and was wrong, but can be in 3? same for E? E cannot be at 5, so at 2,3,4? But if we put I at 2, then position 3: we might put S? Then E at 4? But S at 3 might be possible? And E at 4 then.

But we know E cannot be at 5 (for the secret word) but we are putting it at 4? Then the fifth letter has to be something.

Wait, we need a word: R _ _ _ _

Word: R I S E and then a fifth letter? But we need to avoid A. Also, we have I at 2, S at 3? But earlier we had I at 3 and it was wrong? So if we put S at 3, that could be okay? Because the secret word may have S at 3? We don't know yet.

But we also know that in the secret word, position 3 is not I? So S at 3 might be possible.

But we know S is in the word, but not at position 4? So position 3 could be S? And E not at 5? So E can be in 4? So putting E at 4? Then we'd have R I S E ?

But that's RISE? But RISE has 4 letters? Wait, no: RISE is 4 letters? Wait, we need 5 letters.

R I S E _ ? That would be RISEN? But that's 5 letters? Or RISER? RISES? etc.

But let's check: if we guess RISER?
- R (already known correct? position 1: should be R, which should match? but we have two R's? That might complicate.

Better to avoid duplicate letters? So let's not duplicate R.

Perhaps RISES? Duplicate S? We don't know.

Another word: R I E S T? That would be RIEST? Not common.

R I S K E? Not a valid word.

Perhaps place I at position 4? So R _ _ I _ ?

Then we need S and E? S can be at 2 or 3 or 5? But avoid S at 4? But 4 is I? So S at 2 or 3 or 5? Similarly E at 2 or 3? (since E cannot be at 5? wait, no: E cannot be at 5 in the secret word, but we can put E at 5 to test? Actually, we can put E at any position? But if we put E at 5, and we know E is in the word? Then if the secret word doesn't have E at 5? Then the feedback would show E with a '-' meaning present but not at 5? But that we know already? So it's redundant? So avoid putting E at 5? Similarly avoid putting S at 4? Avoid I at 3?

So for efficient testing, don't put I at position 3? Don't put S at position 4? Don't put E at position 5? Because we already know they are not in those positions? So we want to use positions we don't know.

So with R fixed at 1, available positions: 2,3,4,5.

For I: we can assign to positions 2,4,5? (since cannot be 3).
For S: we can assign to positions 2,3,5? (since cannot be 4).
For E: we can assign to positions 2,3,4? (since cannot be 5).

Additionally, the fifth letter? Because if we assign these, we have four letters? Actually, we have used R, and will use I,S,E? So we need to introduce one extra letter? And avoid A.

So let's try: R _ _ _ _
Assign I to one of 2,4,5; S to one of 2,3,5; E to one of 2,3,4? and one extra position? Actually, we have three positions? No: four positions? Positions:1: R, and positions 2,3,4,5 to be filled with three letters I,S,E and one new letter? Actually, we must include I,S,E? But we can have duplication? But let's avoid for now.

So positions 2,3,4,5: three of them must be I,S,E (in some order) and one a new letter? Actually, that's four positions? So we must use I,S,E and one new letter? Yes? Because the secret word has four distinct letters? Not necessarily? But let's assume no repetition until feedback.

Therefore, let's assign:

Option 1: Put I at position 2? Then for S: at position 3? Then E: at position 4? Then position 5: a new letter?

Word would be R I S E _? Then add a letter? But E is at position 4? Which we know E cannot be at position 5? But position 4 I put E? But the secret word has E? And we are putting E at 4? That might be a valid position? Then the fifth letter: must be any consonant? Perhaps T? R I S E T? RISET? Not a word.

With E at 4? Then the fifth letter? Words: R I S E R? But duplicate R. Avoid? R I S E S? Duplicate S? But valid word: RISES? Or RISEN (N) etc? But if we use RISEN? Then letters: R,I,S,E,N.

Position 1: R? Position 2: I? Position 3: S? Position 4: E? Position 5: N?

But we know that in the secret word, I is not at position 3? But in this guess we are putting I at 2? That's fine? And the secret word has E? But in our first guess E was at 5 and wrong position? So if we put E at 4? This might be valid? Similarly, S was at 4? But now we put S at 3? That might be valid.

But let's consider: if the secret word doesn't have I at position2? Then we'll get feedback.

Similarly, RISEN? But we have to check: letters N? so new letter N.

But the word ""risen"" is valid.

Option 2: Put I at position 4? Then S and E to place? And position 2 and 3 and 5?

For example: R ? ? I ? 

Place S: at position 5? Then E: at position 2? Position 3: new letter? So R E ? I S? Words: REAIS? Not valid? REINS? REINS? But REINS has N? And is it REINS meaning to control a horse? Valid? REINS? But we know A is absent? REINS: R,E,I,N,S.

But S is at position 5? And we know S cannot be at position 4? But position 5 S? That's okay.

Similarly, E at position 2? But we know E cannot be at 5? But position 2 might be okay.

Then feedback might tell us about E at 2, I at 4? Etc.

But REINS is a word? Yes.

Option 3: Put I at position 5? Then we need S and E: at other positions? 

For example: R with S at 2? E at 3? Then position 4: new letter? So R S E ? I? Words: RSEXI? No? Not valid.

Or R S ? I E? but E at 5? But we don't want to put E at 5? Since we know it's wrong? Actually, we can? But no new information? So avoid.

Better to avoid E at 5? Similarly?

Other possibility: use R I ? E S? But I at 2, S at 5? Then position 3: we don't know? And E at 4? But position 4 S was wrong? We are putting E at 4? Then word: R I ? E S? Example R I D E S? Does RIDES have I at 2? Then D at3? E at4? S at5? Valid word? But we avoid A? So D is new? RIDES: letters: R,I,D,E,S.

Now, compare to constraints: we put I at 2? S at 5? E at4? But note E at position 4? In the secret word, position 4 cannot be S? But we are putting E? So that might be okay? And we didn't put I at3? So let's go with RIDES? Or another one.

But we have many options.

Back to our first option: RISEN? Word letters: R,I,S,E,N? Then feedback can tell us about:

- Position 2: I -> if correct then ✓, else ?
- Position 3: S -> if correct? or wrong? 
- Position 4: E -> we know E was not at5? So if it is at4? Then ✓? If not, then -?
- Position 5: N -> new letter.

Similarly, we can do REINS? Which I proposed? Because REINS is a smaller word? But both are valid.

Perhaps the new letter? We want a common letter? Like T, N, D, etc? 

But let me pick REINS? Because it puts:
- Position 2: E? We don't know about E? 
- Position 3: I? But wait: the secret word does not have I at position3? Why? Because in the first guess we had I at position3? And it was marked wrong position? Meaning it is not at position3? Therefore we cannot put I at3? Because we know it's not there? 

Therefore, in any guess, we should not put I at position3? Because it's not the correct position? Similarly, S not at4? E not at5? So for REINS: if we put E at2, I at3, but I cannot be at3? So that would be bad? We putting I at3? But we know I is not at3? So feedback would show I(-) meaning present but not at3? Which we already know? Therefore we are wasting a guess? So we must avoid putting I at position3? Similarly for S at4? E at5?

Therefore, REINS is invalid? Because it puts I at position3? So we must avoid that.

Similarly, RIDES? We put E at position4? and S at position5? That's fine? And I at2? Position3 is D? 

And we don't put S at4? Or E at5? So good.

List for RIDES: 
- Position1: R -> known? So ✓
- Position2: I -> could be correct? or wrong?
- Position3: D -> new letter? 
- Position4: E -> we know E is not at5? So if E is at4? Then ✓? If not, then -?
- Position5: S -> we know S is not at4? So if at5? Then ✓? Otherwise -?

So RIDES is a valid word? And it tests I at2? E at4? S at5? And introduces D.

Similarly, RISEN? 
- Position2: I
- Position3: S
- Position4: E
- Position5: N
But here we put S at3? Which we don't know? Could be correct.

Now, note: we already have feedback from first guess: E was in the word but not at5? So in RISEN, E at4? Could be the correct position? Similarly, S at3? and I at2? 

But in RIDES, we do I at2, E at4, S at5? 

Compare? 

With RISEN? We might confirm if position2 is I? and position3 is S? But we don't have reason? We can choose either.

Let's choose RIDES? Because it introduces a new letter D? and tests E at4? And S at5? Which might be other possible positions.

Another good word could be RILES? R I L E S? Then S at position5? E at position4? L is new? That's similar? But RILES? Letters: R,I,L,E,S? Valid word.

Same as RIDES? But D vs L?

I think either is fine? Or RIVET? R I V E T? But E at4? And V and T new? And S? We know S must be in the word? But if we guess RIVET? Then it doesn't include S? Because we must include all guessed letters? Or wait? We don't have to include all? But we know that S is in the word? So if we don't include S? Then we might miss information? Similarly E and I? So including them? Therefore, the second guess should include I, S, E? Because we know they are present? So RIDES includes I, S, E? Because positions: I at2? E at4? S at5? And R and D? So yes? So I,S,E all included.

Similarly RISEN? Includes I,S,E? And N.

So both RIDES and RISEN are good? But in RISEN? We have S at position3? and E at4? and I at2? And we know S cannot be at4? So if position3 S is correct? That would be new information? Similarly?

But note: we also want to cover positions we haven't tested? So for position2? We don't know? We put I at2? Similarly? 

But also? We might want to test the possibility that E is at position2? That's why? So RIDES puts E at4? And not at2? While RISEN puts I at2? And E at4?

Actually? We know E could be at positions 2,3,4? Similarly I at positions 2,4,5? So in RIDES? We test I at2? E at4? S at5? Then position3: D?

In RISEN? We test I at2? S at3? E at4? S at3? But we don't have S in position3? 

Another possibility: RESIN? R?E?S?I?N? but positions: 
Position1: R? 
Position2: E? 
Position3: S? 
Position4: I? 
Position5: N?

But note: E at2? S at3? I at4? 

Then for E: we know position5 not E? But we put E at2? That could be valid? Similarly I at4? S at3? 

But RESIN? Valid word? 

And we avoid forbidden positions: I at4? Which is not position3? So okay? S at3? Not position4? Okay? E at2? Not position5? Okay? 

And RESIN includes all: R,E,S,I,N? With S at3? which was not tested? 

And what about I? position4? Which we did not test? 

So RESIN might be a good choice? 

But in RESIN? We introduce two new letters? But we already know? Actually? Only one extra letter? Because R,E,S,I,N? So letters: R,E,S,I,N? And in first guess? We had R,I,S,E? So only N new? Same as RISEN? 

But RESIN puts E at position2? And S at position3? And I at position4? 

Whereas RISEN? Puts I at2? S at3? E at4? and N at5.

So both are similar? RESIN: E at2? I at4? 
And RISEN: I at2? E at4? 

Now? Which one might be better? 

Suppose the secret word has E at position2? Then RESIN? E at2? would be ✓? But RISEN? I at2? would be? 

Similarly? We have not tested position2? So we want to know: is position2 one of I,S,E? 

So RESIN gives: position2: E? 

RISEN gives: position2: I? 

Both are possibilities? 

But RESIN also tests S at position3? Which we didn't in RISEN? Wait? RISEN also tests S at position3? 

RISEN: R I S E N? 
Position2: I? 
Position3: S?

RESIN: R E S I N?
Position2: E?
Position3: S?

And both test position4? RESIN: I? RISEN: E?

And position5: RESIN: N? RISEN: N?

So actually they are symmetric? 

But RESIN might be better? Because it is a common word? 

But also? perhaps? if position4 is I? or E? but we don't know? 

Let me choose RESIN? 

But we know? for the secret word? position3 cannot be I? but that doesn't constrain S? 

Similarly? 

Another word? R O S E S? But duplicate S? and O new? But avoids? But we don't? 

But RESIN seems good? 

Or BIRSE? But not start with R? We have R at first? 

So RESIN? 

Let me go with RESIN? 

Or? perhaps? better? 

We also know? in secret word? S cannot be at4? so if we put S at3? we get information. 

RESIN: letters:
- Position1: R? should be ✓? 
- Position2: E? 
- Position3: S? 
- Position4: I? 
- Position5: N?

And we get feedback? 

Similarly? 

Now? after getting feedback? we can deduce more.

But I think RESIN is a valid choice? 

But wait: we know from first guess? S is not at position4? and we put S at position3? That's fine? Also? I is not at position3? and we put I at position4? So it tests a different position? 

Similarly? E was at position5? not correct? So we put at2? 

So I'll go with RESIN? 

Final decision? 

Or let me search? Is there a word that includes?

Previous feedback from ""raise"":
- R is correct and in the correct position (position 1).
- A is absent (not in the word).
- I is present but in the wrong position (not position 3).
- S is present but in the wrong position (not position 4).
- E is present but in the wrong position (not position 5).

Key inferences:
- Secret word starts with R.
- Secret word contains I, S, and E (excludes A).
- I cannot be at position 3, S cannot be at position 4, E cannot be at position 5.
- Possible positions for remaining letters:  
  - I: positions 2, 4, 5  
  - S: positions 2, 3, 5  
  - E: positions 2, 3, 4  
- One unknown letter to discover (no duplication assumed).

Strategy for second guess:
- Keep R in position 1 (confirmed correct).
- Assign I, S, E to untested positions to maximize positional information.
- Avoid forbidden positions: I not at 3, S not at 4, E not at 5.
- Introduce a new common consonant (e.g., N) for coverage.
- Form a valid word: ""resin"" fits:
  - Positions: R (1), E (2), S (3), I (4), N (5)
  - Tests: E at position 2, S at position 3, I at position 4 (all new positions), plus new letter N.
- If E is at position 2 in the secret word, it will show ✓; otherwise, clarify its position via feedback.
- Similarly tests possibilities for S at position 3 and I at position 4.

<guess>resin</guess>",resin,"We received feedback from the first guess:
Guess: RAISE → Feedback: R(✓) A(x) I(-) S(-) E(-)

Interpretation:
- R is in the word and in the correct position (first position). So the secret word starts with R.
- A is not in the word at all. So we can eliminate A.
- I is in the word but not in the third position (since we put it third and got a '-'). It could be in position 1,2,4,5? But position 1 is already taken by R, so I must be in 2,4, or 5. However, note that the first position is R and correct so I must not be first. So I is somewhere else: position 2,4, or 5.
- S is in the word but not in the fourth position. So S could be in position 1,2,3,5? But position 1 is R which is fixed, so S must be in 2,3, or 5. Also, note that I is already in position 3 (from our guess) but it was marked wrong position, so probably position 3 is not S either? Actually, no, S could be in any other position except 4.
- E is in the word but not in the fifth position. So E could be in position 1,2,3,4? Position 1 is R, so E must be in 2,3, or 4.

Summarizing:
- First letter: R (fixed).
- The secret word does not contain A at all.
- I is present, but not at position 3. Possible positions: 2,4,5.
- S is present, but not at position 4. Possible positions: 2,3,5.
- E is present, but not at position 5. Possible positions: 2,3,4.

Also, note: the word has R as first letter, and contains I, S, E, but does not contain A.

Now, we must make a second guess.

Strategy: We want to test possible positions for I, S, E and also try to include other common letters that haven't been tested yet.

In our first guess, we tested letters: R, A, I, S, E. We know A is absent, so we should avoid A. But we know I, S, E are present. Therefore, in the second guess, we can try to place I, S, E in different positions to narrow down their locations.

Important: We must keep R in the first position since we know it's correct? Not necessarily. The feedback doesn't require that we keep the correct letters in the same spot in subsequent guesses? Actually, we can move them to test positions. But note: the feedback will tell us about the letter positions independently.

However, we might want to keep the known correct letter (R) in position to not ""waste"" a letter slot? Or we can try moving it to test other letters?

But R is fixed at the first position, so in the secret word, R is always at start. So in our guesses, we can keep R at first to build on that.

So let's keep R as the first letter.

Therefore, second word must start with R.

Now, we need a word that:
- Starts with R.
- Does not contain A (since A is absent).
- Contains I, S, E (but knowing we can't have them in the positions they were in the first guess: so I not in position 3? Actually, we can try I again in a different position? But note, we already know I is in the word, so we can reuse it? Actually, we can use any letters, as long as we form a valid word.

But we want to test positions for I, S, E.

Specifically:
- Position 2: could be I? or E? or S? or a new letter?
- Position 3: we don't know, but cannot be I (from feedback? wait: in guess1, I was at position 3 and it was marked wrong position, meaning that it is not there in the secret word? So position 3 is not I. Similarly, position 4 is not S, and position 5 is not E.

So:
- Position 3 ≠ I
- Position 4 ≠ S
- Position 5 ≠ E

But for our next guess, we can put I in other positions: 2,4,5? But we have R fixed at position 1.

Let's think of words starting with R that contain I, S, E? But note: S must be in the word and not at position 4, E must be in the word and not at position 5, I must be in the word and not at position 3.

Possible words? We have to form a 5-letter word.

Also, remember the secret word has these letters: R (pos1), I, S, E, and one more letter we don't know (because we have 4 letters identified and one unknown? Actually, in the secret word, we know it has R, I, S, E. That's four, so there is one more letter).

We don't know if the secret word has repeated letters, but we should avoid repeating letters for now to avoid confusion? Unless we have reason to suspect repetition.

But in the first guess, we had five distinct letters: R,A,I,S,E. We only know that I,S,E appear, R appears at start, and A is absent. So the secret word must have R, I, S, E, and one other letter (could be a duplicate? but let's assume no duplication until we get duplicate feedback? Actually, we don't know).

Now, let's try to form a second guess:

Constraints:
- Start with R
- Include I (but not in position 3? Actually, in this guess we can put I in position 2,4, or 5? But we need to avoid the known wrong positions only for the secret word? Not for our guess? We are free to put I anywhere? Actually, yes, we can put I in position 3 again? But that would give us no new information? So better not.

So avoid putting I in position 3 because we know it's not there? Similarly, avoid S in position 4? Avoid E in position 5.

So for the second guess, we'll try to put I in position 2 or 4 or 5? Similarly for S and E? But we also have to include them all.

But we have five positions: 
Position 1: R (fixed)
Position 2: we can put a new letter? Or moving E, I, S? Actually, we must form a valid word.

Some ideas:

Option: try I in position 2? Then S and E in other positions? But S cannot be in 4? So S could be in 2 (but if we put I at 2, then S can be 3 or 5? but S was already tried at 4 and was wrong, but can be in 3? same for E? E cannot be at 5, so at 2,3,4? But if we put I at 2, then position 3: we might put S? Then E at 4? But S at 3 might be possible? And E at 4 then.

But we know E cannot be at 5 (for the secret word) but we are putting it at 4? Then the fifth letter has to be something.

Wait, we need a word: R _ _ _ _

Word: R I S E and then a fifth letter? But we need to avoid A. Also, we have I at 2, S at 3? But earlier we had I at 3 and it was wrong? So if we put S at 3, that could be okay? Because the secret word may have S at 3? We don't know yet.

But we also know that in the secret word, position 3 is not I? So S at 3 might be possible.

But we know S is in the word, but not at position 4? So position 3 could be S? And E not at 5? So E can be in 4? So putting E at 4? Then we'd have R I S E ?

But that's RISE? But RISE has 4 letters? Wait, no: RISE is 4 letters? Wait, we need 5 letters.

R I S E _ ? That would be RISEN? But that's 5 letters? Or RISER? RISES? etc.

But let's check: if we guess RISER?
- R (already known correct? position 1: should be R, which should match? but we have two R's? That might complicate.

Better to avoid duplicate letters? So let's not duplicate R.

Perhaps RISES? Duplicate S? We don't know.

Another word: R I E S T? That would be RIEST? Not common.

R I S K E? Not a valid word.

Perhaps place I at position 4? So R _ _ I _ ?

Then we need S and E? S can be at 2 or 3 or 5? But avoid S at 4? But 4 is I? So S at 2 or 3 or 5? Similarly E at 2 or 3? (since E cannot be at 5? wait, no: E cannot be at 5 in the secret word, but we can put E at 5 to test? Actually, we can put E at any position? But if we put E at 5, and we know E is in the word? Then if the secret word doesn't have E at 5? Then the feedback would show E with a '-' meaning present but not at 5? But that we know already? So it's redundant? So avoid putting E at 5? Similarly avoid putting S at 4? Avoid I at 3?

So for efficient testing, don't put I at position 3? Don't put S at position 4? Don't put E at position 5? Because we already know they are not in those positions? So we want to use positions we don't know.

So with R fixed at 1, available positions: 2,3,4,5.

For I: we can assign to positions 2,4,5? (since cannot be 3).
For S: we can assign to positions 2,3,5? (since cannot be 4).
For E: we can assign to positions 2,3,4? (since cannot be 5).

Additionally, the fifth letter? Because if we assign these, we have four letters? Actually, we have used R, and will use I,S,E? So we need to introduce one extra letter? And avoid A.

So let's try: R _ _ _ _
Assign I to one of 2,4,5; S to one of 2,3,5; E to one of 2,3,4? and one extra position? Actually, we have three positions? No: four positions? Positions:1: R, and positions 2,3,4,5 to be filled with three letters I,S,E and one new letter? Actually, we must include I,S,E? But we can have duplication? But let's avoid for now.

So positions 2,3,4,5: three of them must be I,S,E (in some order) and one a new letter? Actually, that's four positions? So we must use I,S,E and one new letter? Yes? Because the secret word has four distinct letters? Not necessarily? But let's assume no repetition until feedback.

Therefore, let's assign:

Option 1: Put I at position 2? Then for S: at position 3? Then E: at position 4? Then position 5: a new letter?

Word would be R I S E _? Then add a letter? But E is at position 4? Which we know E cannot be at position 5? But position 4 I put E? But the secret word has E? And we are putting E at 4? That might be a valid position? Then the fifth letter: must be any consonant? Perhaps T? R I S E T? RISET? Not a word.

With E at 4? Then the fifth letter? Words: R I S E R? But duplicate R. Avoid? R I S E S? Duplicate S? But valid word: RISES? Or RISEN (N) etc? But if we use RISEN? Then letters: R,I,S,E,N.

Position 1: R? Position 2: I? Position 3: S? Position 4: E? Position 5: N?

But we know that in the secret word, I is not at position 3? But in this guess we are putting I at 2? That's fine? And the secret word has E? But in our first guess E was at 5 and wrong position? So if we put E at 4? This might be valid? Similarly, S was at 4? But now we put S at 3? That might be valid.

But let's consider: if the secret word doesn't have I at position2? Then we'll get feedback.

Similarly, RISEN? But we have to check: letters N? so new letter N.

But the word ""risen"" is valid.

Option 2: Put I at position 4? Then S and E to place? And position 2 and 3 and 5?

For example: R ? ? I ? 

Place S: at position 5? Then E: at position 2? Position 3: new letter? So R E ? I S? Words: REAIS? Not valid? REINS? REINS? But REINS has N? And is it REINS meaning to control a horse? Valid? REINS? But we know A is absent? REINS: R,E,I,N,S.

But S is at position 5? And we know S cannot be at position 4? But position 5 S? That's okay.

Similarly, E at position 2? But we know E cannot be at 5? But position 2 might be okay.

Then feedback might tell us about E at 2, I at 4? Etc.

But REINS is a word? Yes.

Option 3: Put I at position 5? Then we need S and E: at other positions? 

For example: R with S at 2? E at 3? Then position 4: new letter? So R S E ? I? Words: RSEXI? No? Not valid.

Or R S ? I E? but E at 5? But we don't want to put E at 5? Since we know it's wrong? Actually, we can? But no new information? So avoid.

Better to avoid E at 5? Similarly?

Other possibility: use R I ? E S? But I at 2, S at 5? Then position 3: we don't know? And E at 4? But position 4 S was wrong? We are putting E at 4? Then word: R I ? E S? Example R I D E S? Does RIDES have I at 2? Then D at3? E at4? S at5? Valid word? But we avoid A? So D is new? RIDES: letters: R,I,D,E,S.

Now, compare to constraints: we put I at 2? S at 5? E at4? But note E at position 4? In the secret word, position 4 cannot be S? But we are putting E? So that might be okay? And we didn't put I at3? So let's go with RIDES? Or another one.

But we have many options.

Back to our first option: RISEN? Word letters: R,I,S,E,N? Then feedback can tell us about:

- Position 2: I -> if correct then ✓, else ?
- Position 3: S -> if correct? or wrong? 
- Position 4: E -> we know E was not at5? So if it is at4? Then ✓? If not, then -?
- Position 5: N -> new letter.

Similarly, we can do REINS? Which I proposed? Because REINS is a smaller word? But both are valid.

Perhaps the new letter? We want a common letter? Like T, N, D, etc? 

But let me pick REINS? Because it puts:
- Position 2: E? We don't know about E? 
- Position 3: I? But wait: the secret word does not have I at position3? Why? Because in the first guess we had I at position3? And it was marked wrong position? Meaning it is not at position3? Therefore we cannot put I at3? Because we know it's not there? 

Therefore, in any guess, we should not put I at position3? Because it's not the correct position? Similarly, S not at4? E not at5? So for REINS: if we put E at2, I at3, but I cannot be at3? So that would be bad? We putting I at3? But we know I is not at3? So feedback would show I(-) meaning present but not at3? Which we already know? Therefore we are wasting a guess? So we must avoid putting I at position3? Similarly for S at4? E at5?

Therefore, REINS is invalid? Because it puts I at position3? So we must avoid that.

Similarly, RIDES? We put E at position4? and S at position5? That's fine? And I at2? Position3 is D? 

And we don't put S at4? Or E at5? So good.

List for RIDES: 
- Position1: R -> known? So ✓
- Position2: I -> could be correct? or wrong?
- Position3: D -> new letter? 
- Position4: E -> we know E is not at5? So if E is at4? Then ✓? If not, then -?
- Position5: S -> we know S is not at4? So if at5? Then ✓? Otherwise -?

So RIDES is a valid word? And it tests I at2? E at4? S at5? And introduces D.

Similarly, RISEN? 
- Position2: I
- Position3: S
- Position4: E
- Position5: N
But here we put S at3? Which we don't know? Could be correct.

Now, note: we already have feedback from first guess: E was in the word but not at5? So in RISEN, E at4? Could be the correct position? Similarly, S at3? and I at2? 

But in RIDES, we do I at2, E at4, S at5? 

Compare? 

With RISEN? We might confirm if position2 is I? and position3 is S? But we don't have reason? We can choose either.

Let's choose RIDES? Because it introduces a new letter D? and tests E at4? And S at5? Which might be other possible positions.

Another good word could be RILES? R I L E S? Then S at position5? E at position4? L is new? That's similar? But RILES? Letters: R,I,L,E,S? Valid word.

Same as RIDES? But D vs L?

I think either is fine? Or RIVET? R I V E T? But E at4? And V and T new? And S? We know S must be in the word? But if we guess RIVET? Then it doesn't include S? Because we must include all guessed letters? Or wait? We don't have to include all? But we know that S is in the word? So if we don't include S? Then we might miss information? Similarly E and I? So including them? Therefore, the second guess should include I, S, E? Because we know they are present? So RIDES includes I, S, E? Because positions: I at2? E at4? S at5? And R and D? So yes? So I,S,E all included.

Similarly RISEN? Includes I,S,E? And N.

So both RIDES and RISEN are good? But in RISEN? We have S at position3? and E at4? and I at2? And we know S cannot be at4? So if position3 S is correct? That would be new information? Similarly?

But note: we also want to cover positions we haven't tested? So for position2? We don't know? We put I at2? Similarly? 

But also? We might want to test the possibility that E is at position2? That's why? So RIDES puts E at4? And not at2? While RISEN puts I at2? And E at4?

Actually? We know E could be at positions 2,3,4? Similarly I at positions 2,4,5? So in RIDES? We test I at2? E at4? S at5? Then position3: D?

In RISEN? We test I at2? S at3? E at4? S at3? But we don't have S in position3? 

Another possibility: RESIN? R?E?S?I?N? but positions: 
Position1: R? 
Position2: E? 
Position3: S? 
Position4: I? 
Position5: N?

But note: E at2? S at3? I at4? 

Then for E: we know position5 not E? But we put E at2? That could be valid? Similarly I at4? S at3? 

But RESIN? Valid word? 

And we avoid forbidden positions: I at4? Which is not position3? So okay? S at3? Not position4? Okay? E at2? Not position5? Okay? 

And RESIN includes all: R,E,S,I,N? With S at3? which was not tested? 

And what about I? position4? Which we did not test? 

So RESIN might be a good choice? 

But in RESIN? We introduce two new letters? But we already know? Actually? Only one extra letter? Because R,E,S,I,N? So letters: R,E,S,I,N? And in first guess? We had R,I,S,E? So only N new? Same as RISEN? 

But RESIN puts E at position2? And S at position3? And I at position4? 

Whereas RISEN? Puts I at2? S at3? E at4? and N at5.

So both are similar? RESIN: E at2? I at4? 
And RISEN: I at2? E at4? 

Now? Which one might be better? 

Suppose the secret word has E at position2? Then RESIN? E at2? would be ✓? But RISEN? I at2? would be? 

Similarly? We have not tested position2? So we want to know: is position2 one of I,S,E? 

So RESIN gives: position2: E? 

RISEN gives: position2: I? 

Both are possibilities? 

But RESIN also tests S at position3? Which we didn't in RISEN? Wait? RISEN also tests S at position3? 

RISEN: R I S E N? 
Position2: I? 
Position3: S?

RESIN: R E S I N?
Position2: E?
Position3: S?

And both test position4? RESIN: I? RISEN: E?

And position5: RESIN: N? RISEN: N?

So actually they are symmetric? 

But RESIN might be better? Because it is a common word? 

But also? perhaps? if position4 is I? or E? but we don't know? 

Let me choose RESIN? 

But we know? for the secret word? position3 cannot be I? but that doesn't constrain S? 

Similarly? 

Another word? R O S E S? But duplicate S? and O new? But avoids? But we don't? 

But RESIN seems good? 

Or BIRSE? But not start with R? We have R at first? 

So RESIN? 

Let me go with RESIN? 

Or? perhaps? better? 

We also know? in secret word? S cannot be at4? so if we put S at3? we get information. 

RESIN: letters:
- Position1: R? should be ✓? 
- Position2: E? 
- Position3: S? 
- Position4: I? 
- Position5: N?

And we get feedback? 

Similarly? 

Now? after getting feedback? we can deduce more.

But I think RESIN is a valid choice? 

But wait: we know from first guess? S is not at position4? and we put S at position3? That's fine? Also? I is not at position3? and we put I at position4? So it tests a different position? 

Similarly? E was at position5? not correct? So we put at2? 

So I'll go with RESIN?

- Avoid forbidden positions: I not at 3, S not at 4, E not at 5.
- Introduce a new common consonant (e.g., N) for coverage.
- Form a valid word: ""resin"" fits:
  - Positions: R (1), E (2), S (3), I (4), N (5)
  - Tests: E at position 2, S at position 3, I at position 4 (all new positions), plus new letter N.
- If E is at position 2 in the secret word, it will show ✓; otherwise, clarify its position via feedback.
- Similarly tests possibilities for S at position 3 and I at position 4.",Guess 2: resin -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) E(✓) S(✓) I(✓) N(✓),SUCCESS
