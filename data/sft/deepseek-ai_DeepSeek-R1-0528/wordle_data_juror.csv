We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a guess that maximizes the information gained.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid duplicates to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", etc. Let me choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.
 After we get the feedback, we can use it to narrow down the possibilities.
</think>
<thinking>
As this is my first guess, I don't have any prior feedback to work with. The optimal approach is to choose a starting word that maximizes information gain by including:
- Common English letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words (E, A, R, S, T, etc.)
- A mix of vowels and consonants to cover more possibilities
- No repeating letters to check more distinct characters

Considering these principles, ""CRANE"" is an excellent first guess because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, E) and 2 common consonants (C, R, N)
2. All letters are distinct, testing 5 different characters
3. Frequently used as an opener in word games due to its balanced letter distribution

After submitting ""CRANE"", I'll analyze the feedback pattern (✓,-,x) to identify matching letters and positions, which will guide my next guess.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"": 
C: x (not in the word)
R: - (in the word but wrong position)
A: x (not in the word)
N: x (not in the word)
E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since in CRANE, R is at position 2, and it's marked as wrong position).
- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter R, but not in the second position. Also, it does not contain C, A, N, E.

We have 6 tries and this was the first guess. Now we need to make a second guess.

We should choose a word that:
- Includes R (since we know it's in the word) and places it in a different position than the second (because in the first guess it was in the second and was wrong).
- Avoids the letters C, A, N, E (since they are not in the word).
- Uses other common letters to maximize the chance of getting more information.

Possible positions for R: since it's not in position 2, it could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

We also know the word is 5 letters and must be a valid English word.

Let's think of words that have R in one of the positions 1, 3, 4, 5 and avoid C, A, N, E.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, etc.

A good second guess might be a word that has R and several of these new letters.

For example, let's consider words starting with S or T, as they are common.

We can try to put R in the first position? But note: we don't know if R is in the first position or not. We only know it's not in the second.

But we can try a word that has R in a different position.

Let me list some words that have R and avoid C, A, N, E.

Example: ""ROUST"" - but that has U and O, which we haven't tested. But let's see.

Alternatively, ""TRIES"" - but that has E, which we know is not in the word. So we must avoid E.

We must avoid E because it was marked as not present.

So, we need a word without C, A, N, E.

Let me think of words with R and without these letters.

Common words: 
- ""SPORT"": has S, P, O, R, T. R is at position 4. But we don't know if O is in the word or not.
- ""STORM"": has S, T, O, R, M. R is at position 4. Also, we avoid C, A, N, E.

But note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates yet.

Another idea: ""DRUID"" - but D is a new letter, but we have to avoid A and E? ""DRUID"" has D, R, U, I, D? Wait, duplicate D? Also, it has U and I which are new.

But we know R is in the word, so we can try to use it.

But perhaps we can choose a word that has R and many common consonants and vowels that we haven't tried.

Vowels we haven't tried: O, I, U (and sometimes Y, but let's avoid Y for now).

We know the word must have at least one R, and we have 5 positions to fill without C, A, N, E.

Let me try to come up with a word that has R and uses common letters.

One classic word is ""ROUND"", but that has O, U, N, D. But N is not allowed (we know N is not in the word). So we cannot use N.

So avoid N.

Another: ""PROUD"" - has P, R, O, U, D. R is at position 2? But wait, in our first guess, R was at position 2 and it was marked as wrong position. So if we put R at position 2 again, it would still be wrong? But we don't know if the secret word has R at position 2 or not? Actually, the feedback for the first guess said R is in the word but not at position 2. So if we put R at position 2 again, it would still be marked as wrong position (if the correct position is not 2) or correct if it is? But we know it's not at position 2? Actually, the feedback only tells us that in the first guess, R was not at the correct position. But it might be that the secret word has R at position 2? No, because if it were at position 2, it would have been marked as correct (✓). But it was marked as wrong position (-), meaning R is in the word but not at position 2. Therefore, position 2 is definitely not the correct position for R.

So if we put R at position 2 again, it would still be marked as wrong position (unless the secret word has two R's and one of them is at position 2? But we don't know about duplicates). However, to avoid confusion, it might be better to put R in a different position to test a new spot.

But we don't have to avoid position 2 for R? Actually, we know that position 2 is not correct for R, so if we put R at position 2 again, we will get the same feedback (wrong position) and we don't gain new information about the position. So it's better to try R in a new position.

Therefore, for the second guess, we should put R in one of the positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Let me try to form a word without C, A, N, E and with R in a new position.

For example, position 1: R at the start.

Words: ""ROAST"" - but has A, which is not allowed. Avoid A.

""ROOST"" - has O, O, S, T. But O is repeated? And we don't know about O. Also, it has O and S, T.

But we avoid A, but O is new.

""ROOTS"" - similar.

But we can use ""ROILS"" or ""ROUPS"" but not common.

Another: ""RISKY"" - has R at position 1, I, S, K, Y. Avoids C, A, N, E. But Y is less common.

Alternatively, position 3: for example, ""BORED"" - but has E, which is not allowed.

""FORTS"" - has F, O, R, T, S. R is at position 3. Avoids C, A, N, E.

""PORTS"" - similar.

Position 4: ""SPORT"", as I thought earlier.

Position 5: ""LATER"" - but has A and E, not allowed.

""RUMOR"" - has U, M, O, R. R at the end? But also R at the beginning? Duplicate R.

We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but we can avoid for now.

After considering, I think ""SPORT"" is a good candidate:
- S, P, O, R, T
- R is at position 4 (a new position, not 2)
- Avoids C, A, N, E
- Uses common letters: S, P, O, T

Another candidate: ""STORM"" - similar, with R at position 4 and M instead of P.

But we might get more information with ""SPORT"" or ""STORM"".

Alternatively, ""TRIPS"" - has T, R, I, P, S. R at position 2? But we don't want to put R at position 2 again because we know it's not correct and we won't get new position info.

In ""TRIPS"", R is at position 2. We know position 2 is not correct for R, so we would get the same feedback for R (wrong position) and we don't learn a new position. So it's better to avoid position 2 for R in this guess.

Therefore, let's avoid words with R at position 2.

So, ""SPORT"" has R at position 4.

Similarly, ""DRIPS"" has R at position 3? D, R, I, P, S. But we don't know about D.

But ""DRIPS"" has R at position 2? No: D is position 1, R is position 2. So that's position 2 again. We don't want that.

How about ""GRIPS""? G is new, but R is at position 2 again.

We want R not at position 2.

So let's look for words with R at 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Another word: ""PURSE"" - but has E, not allowed.

""BIRDS"" - has B, I, R, D, S. R is at position 3. Avoids C, A, N, E.

But B is new.

""FIRST"" - F, I, R, S, T. R at position 3. Avoids C, A, N, E.

Similarly, ""THIRD"" - T, H, I, R, D. R at position 4.

But we have to choose one.

I think ""FIRST"" is a good choice because it has common letters: F, I, S, T and R at position 3.

But F is not the most common, but it's okay.

Alternatively, ""SPORT"" is also good.

To maximize vowel information, we can include a vowel we haven't tried. We haven't tried O, I, U.

In ""SPORT"", we have O. In ""FIRST"", we have I.

Both are good.

I'll go with ""SPORT"" because it has O, which is a common vowel, and we get to test S, P, O, T as well.

So, second guess: ""SPORT""

We hope to get feedback on these letters.

If we get a correct position for R, that would be great. But if not, we'll know more.

So, let's choose ""SPORT"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, A, N, E are not in the secret word (marked as ""x"").
- R is in the word but not in the second position (marked as ""-"").

For the second guess, I need to:
- Include R (since it's in the secret word) but avoid placing it in the second position again to test a new location.
- Exclude C, A, N, E entirely.
- Use other common letters to maximize information gain (e.g., S, T, O, P).

I chose ""SPORT"" because:
- It places R in the fourth position (a new location to test).
- It avoids C, A, N, E and introduces new common letters: S, P, O, T.
- This combination helps test for vowels (O) and frequent consonants, providing broad coverage.

<guess>SPORT</guess>",SPORT,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"": 
C: x (not in the word)
R: - (in the word but wrong position)
A: x (not in the word)
N: x (not in the word)
E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since in CRANE, R is at position 2, and it's marked as wrong position).
- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter R, but not in the second position. Also, it does not contain C, A, N, E.

We must avoid E because it was marked as not present.

- ""STORM"": has S, T, O, R, M. R is at position 4. Also, we avoid C, A, N, E.

""RUMOR"" - has U, M, O, R. R at the end? But also R at the beginning? Duplicate R.

We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but we can avoid for now.

- R is at position 4 (a new position, not 2)
- Avoids C, A, N, E

Therefore, let's avoid words with R at position 2.

So, ""SPORT"" has R at position 4.

Similarly, ""DRIPS"" has R at position 3? D, R, I, P, S. But we don't know about D.

But ""DRIPS"" has R at position 2? No: D is position 1, R is position 2. So that's position 2 again. We don't want that.

How about ""GRIPS""? G is new, but R is at position 2 again.

We want R not at position 2.

So let's look for words with R at 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Another word: ""PURSE"" - but has E, not allowed.

""BIRDS"" - has B, I, R, D, S. R is at position 3. Avoids C, A, N, E.

But B is new.

""FIRST"" - F, I, R, S, T. R at position 3. Avoids C, A, N, E.

Similarly, ""THIRD"" - T, H, I, R, D. R at position 4.

But we have to choose one.

I think ""FIRST"" is a good choice because it has common letters: F, I, S, T and R at position 3.

But F is not the most common, but it's okay.

Alternatively, ""SPORT"" is also good.

To maximize vowel information, we can include a vowel we haven't tried. We haven't tried O, I, U.

In ""SPORT"", we have O. In ""FIRST"", we have I.

Both are good.

I'll go with ""SPORT"" because it has O, which is a common vowel, and we get to test S, P, O, T as well.

So, second guess: ""SPORT""

We hope to get feedback on these letters.

If we get a correct position for R, that would be great. But if not, we'll know more.

So, let's choose ""SPORT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,juror,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a guess that maximizes the information gained.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid duplicates to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", etc. Let me choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.
 After we get the feedback, we can use it to narrow down the possibilities.<thinking>
As this is my first guess, I don't have any prior feedback to work with. The optimal approach is to choose a starting word that maximizes information gain by including:
- Common English letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words (E, A, R, S, T, etc.)
- A mix of vowels and consonants to cover more possibilities
- No repeating letters to check more distinct characters

Considering these principles, ""CRANE"" is an excellent first guess because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, E) and 2 common consonants (C, R, N)
2. All letters are distinct, testing 5 different characters
3. Frequently used as an opener in word games due to its balanced letter distribution

After submitting ""CRANE"", I'll analyze the feedback pattern (✓,-,x) to identify matching letters and positions, which will guide my next guess.
</thinking>

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"": 
C: x (not in the word)
R: - (in the word but wrong position)
A: x (not in the word)
N: x (not in the word)
E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since in CRANE, R is at position 2, and it's marked as wrong position).
- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter R, but not in the second position. Also, it does not contain C, A, N, E.

We have 6 tries and this was the first guess. Now we need to make a second guess.

We should choose a word that:
- Includes R (since we know it's in the word) and places it in a different position than the second (because in the first guess it was in the second and was wrong).
- Avoids the letters C, A, N, E (since they are not in the word).
- Uses other common letters to maximize the chance of getting more information.

Possible positions for R: since it's not in position 2, it could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

We also know the word is 5 letters and must be a valid English word.

Let's think of words that have R in one of the positions 1, 3, 4, 5 and avoid C, A, N, E.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, etc.

A good second guess might be a word that has R and several of these new letters.

For example, let's consider words starting with S or T, as they are common.

We can try to put R in the first position? But note: we don't know if R is in the first position or not. We only know it's not in the second.

But we can try a word that has R in a different position.

Let me list some words that have R and avoid C, A, N, E.

Example: ""ROUST"" - but that has U and O, which we haven't tested. But let's see.

Alternatively, ""TRIES"" - but that has E, which we know is not in the word. So we must avoid E.

We must avoid E because it was marked as not present.

So, we need a word without C, A, N, E.

Let me think of words with R and without these letters.

Common words: 
- ""SPORT"": has S, P, O, R, T. R is at position 4. But we don't know if O is in the word or not.
- ""STORM"": has S, T, O, R, M. R is at position 4. Also, we avoid C, A, N, E.

But note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates yet.

Another idea: ""DRUID"" - but D is a new letter, but we have to avoid A and E? ""DRUID"" has D, R, U, I, D? Wait, duplicate D? Also, it has U and I which are new.

But we know R is in the word, so we can try to use it.

But perhaps we can choose a word that has R and many common consonants and vowels that we haven't tried.

Vowels we haven't tried: O, I, U (and sometimes Y, but let's avoid Y for now).

We know the word must have at least one R, and we have 5 positions to fill without C, A, N, E.

Let me try to come up with a word that has R and uses common letters.

One classic word is ""ROUND"", but that has O, U, N, D. But N is not allowed (we know N is not in the word). So we cannot use N.

So avoid N.

Another: ""PROUD"" - has P, R, O, U, D. R is at position 2? But wait, in our first guess, R was at position 2 and it was marked as wrong position. So if we put R at position 2 again, it would still be wrong? But we don't know if the secret word has R at position 2 or not? Actually, the feedback for the first guess said R is in the word but not at position 2. So if we put R at position 2 again, it would still be marked as wrong position (if the correct position is not 2) or correct if it is? But we know it's not at position 2? Actually, the feedback only tells us that in the first guess, R was not at the correct position. But it might be that the secret word has R at position 2? No, because if it were at position 2, it would have been marked as correct (✓). But it was marked as wrong position (-), meaning R is in the word but not at position 2. Therefore, position 2 is definitely not the correct position for R.

So if we put R at position 2 again, it would still be marked as wrong position (unless the secret word has two R's and one of them is at position 2? But we don't know about duplicates). However, to avoid confusion, it might be better to put R in a different position to test a new spot.

But we don't have to avoid position 2 for R? Actually, we know that position 2 is not correct for R, so if we put R at position 2 again, we will get the same feedback (wrong position) and we don't gain new information about the position. So it's better to try R in a new position.

Therefore, for the second guess, we should put R in one of the positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Let me try to form a word without C, A, N, E and with R in a new position.

For example, position 1: R at the start.

Words: ""ROAST"" - but has A, which is not allowed. Avoid A.

""ROOST"" - has O, O, S, T. But O is repeated? And we don't know about O. Also, it has O and S, T.

But we avoid A, but O is new.

""ROOTS"" - similar.

But we can use ""ROILS"" or ""ROUPS"" but not common.

Another: ""RISKY"" - has R at position 1, I, S, K, Y. Avoids C, A, N, E. But Y is less common.

Alternatively, position 3: for example, ""BORED"" - but has E, which is not allowed.

""FORTS"" - has F, O, R, T, S. R is at position 3. Avoids C, A, N, E.

""PORTS"" - similar.

Position 4: ""SPORT"", as I thought earlier.

Position 5: ""LATER"" - but has A and E, not allowed.

""RUMOR"" - has U, M, O, R. R at the end? But also R at the beginning? Duplicate R.

We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but we can avoid for now.

After considering, I think ""SPORT"" is a good candidate:
- S, P, O, R, T
- R is at position 4 (a new position, not 2)
- Avoids C, A, N, E
- Uses common letters: S, P, O, T

Another candidate: ""STORM"" - similar, with R at position 4 and M instead of P.

But we might get more information with ""SPORT"" or ""STORM"".

Alternatively, ""TRIPS"" - has T, R, I, P, S. R at position 2? But we don't want to put R at position 2 again because we know it's not correct and we won't get new position info.

In ""TRIPS"", R is at position 2. We know position 2 is not correct for R, so we would get the same feedback for R (wrong position) and we don't learn a new position. So it's better to avoid position 2 for R in this guess.

Therefore, let's avoid words with R at position 2.

So, ""SPORT"" has R at position 4.

Similarly, ""DRIPS"" has R at position 3? D, R, I, P, S. But we don't know about D.

But ""DRIPS"" has R at position 2? No: D is position 1, R is position 2. So that's position 2 again. We don't want that.

How about ""GRIPS""? G is new, but R is at position 2 again.

We want R not at position 2.

So let's look for words with R at 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Another word: ""PURSE"" - but has E, not allowed.

""BIRDS"" - has B, I, R, D, S. R is at position 3. Avoids C, A, N, E.

But B is new.

""FIRST"" - F, I, R, S, T. R at position 3. Avoids C, A, N, E.

Similarly, ""THIRD"" - T, H, I, R, D. R at position 4.

But we have to choose one.

I think ""FIRST"" is a good choice because it has common letters: F, I, S, T and R at position 3.

But F is not the most common, but it's okay.

Alternatively, ""SPORT"" is also good.

To maximize vowel information, we can include a vowel we haven't tried. We haven't tried O, I, U.

In ""SPORT"", we have O. In ""FIRST"", we have I.

Both are good.

I'll go with ""SPORT"" because it has O, which is a common vowel, and we get to test S, P, O, T as well.

So, second guess: ""SPORT""

We hope to get feedback on these letters.

If we get a correct position for R, that would be great. But if not, we'll know more.

So, let's choose ""SPORT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, A, N, E are not in the secret word (marked as ""x"").
- R is in the word but not in the second position (marked as ""-"").

For the second guess, I need to:
- Include R (since it's in the secret word) but avoid placing it in the second position again to test a new location.
- Exclude C, A, N, E entirely.
- Use other common letters to maximize information gain (e.g., S, T, O, P).

I chose ""SPORT"" because:
- It places R in the fourth position (a new location to test).
- It avoids C, A, N, E and introduces new common letters: S, P, O, T.
- This combination helps test for vowels (O) and frequent consonants, providing broad coverage.

We have two guesses and their feedback:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: x (not in word)
- R: - (in word, wrong position)
- A: x (not in word)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: x (not in word)

From this, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter R, but not in the second position (index 1, if we index from 0).
- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: SPORT
- S: x (not in word)
- P: x (not in word)
- O: - (in word, wrong position)
- R: - (in word, wrong position)
- T: x (not in word)

From this, we know:
- The secret word contains O and R, but not in the positions they were guessed (O was in position 2, R was in position 3).
- The letters S, P, T are not in the word.

Combining the information:
- Letters not in the word: C, A, N, E, S, P, T
- Letters in the word: R and O (and we know they are not in positions 1 and 3 for R? Let's clarify positions).

Position indices (0-indexed for clarity):
- CRANE: positions 0:C, 1:R, 2:A, 3:N, 4:E
- SPORT: positions 0:S, 1:P, 2:O, 3:R, 4:T

From CRANE: R is in the word but not at position 1.
From SPORT: R is in the word but not at position 3, and O is in the word but not at position 2.

So R is in the word, but not at index 1 or 3. Therefore, R must be at one of the positions: 0, 2, or 4? But wait, we have 5 positions: 0,1,2,3,4.

But note: in CRANE, R was at position 1 (which is the second letter) and we know it's not there. In SPORT, R was at position 3 (the fourth letter) and it's not there. So R cannot be at position 1 or 3. Therefore, R must be at position 0, 2, or 4.

Similarly, O is in the word but not at position 2 (from SPORT). So O must be at position 0, 1, 3, or 4? But we have to consider the constraints.

Also, we know the following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, E, S, P, T.

So the secret word must contain R and O, and three other letters that are not in the excluded set.

We have 6 tries, and we are on the third guess.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Includes R and O (both must appear, but not at the positions we've already tried for them)
- Excludes C, A, N, E, S, P, T
- Tries to place R in one of the positions 0, 2, or 4 (since it can't be at 1 or 3)
- Tries to place O in a position that is not 2 (so 0,1,3,4) but note that if we place O at a position, we have to avoid the positions we know are wrong for R? They are independent.

But also, we want to test new letters to get more information.

What letters are left? We have the alphabet minus the excluded ones.

Excluded: C, A, N, E, S, P, T

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: O and R are already known to be in the word, so we need to include them.

We also want to use common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.

Common letters: among the available, we have B, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, U, etc.

We need to form a word that has R and O, and three other letters from the available set.

Moreover, we have constraints on the positions for R and O.

Let me think of words that have R and O, without the excluded letters.

For example, words like:
- FLOUR: but has F, L, O, U, R. But we have to check positions. Also, we don't know about F, L, U.
- BROIL: B, R, O, I, L. This might work.

But we need to assign positions.

We know R cannot be at position 1 or 3. So in the word we guess, we should avoid putting R at 1 or 3.

Similarly, O cannot be at position 2.

So for the next guess, we can try to put R at position 0 (the first letter) and O at position 4 (the last), for example, to test new positions.

But we have to form a valid word.

Let me list possible words:

Option 1: R at position 0, O at position 1? But position 1: we know from CRANE that R was at position 1 and it was wrong, but that doesn't say anything about O. However, we have to avoid putting R at 1, but O can be at 1.

But we don't have a constraint that O cannot be at 1. Only that it cannot be at 2.

So possible:

- R at 0, O at 1: e.g., ""ROBOT"" but has B and T? T is excluded. So not.

""ROBOT"" has T, which is excluded.

""ROOMY"" has O repeated and Y, but we don't know about Y. Also, O repeated? We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but we can avoid for now.

""ROWDY"": R, O, W, D, Y. Avoids excluded letters? W, D, Y are not excluded. So ""ROWDY"" is a candidate.

Positions: R at 0, O at 1, W at 2, D at 3, Y at 4.

But we have to check the constraints for R and O:
- R is at 0: which is allowed (not 1 or 3).
- O is at 1: which is allowed (only constraint is not at 2).

So that's okay.

But we are testing O at position 1 and R at position 0.

Another option: put R at position 2 and O at position 4.

For example, ""BROOD"" has O repeated and D, but B is allowed? ""BROOD"": B, R, O, O, D. But duplicate O? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, O is at position 2? But we know O cannot be at position 2 (from SPORT feedback). So if we put O at position 2, it would be wrong, but we already know that. So it's a waste of a position. We should avoid putting O at position 2.

Similarly, we should avoid putting R at positions 1 and 3.

So in our next guess, we should avoid:
- R at positions 1 and 3
- O at position 2

Now, back to ""ROWDY"": it uses R at 0, O at 1, and new letters W, D, Y.

But we don't know if W, D, Y are in the word. It's a good way to test them.

Another word: ""ROGUE"" but E is excluded.

""ROBIN"": R, O, B, I, N. But N is excluded (from CRANE: N is not in the word). So invalid.

""ROOMY"": O repeated and we don't know about duplicates. Also, Y is at the end.

But let's avoid duplicates for now.

""ROWDY"" seems acceptable.

Another word: ""FROWN"": F, R, O, W, N. But N is excluded.

""GROWL"": G, R, O, W, L. This avoids excluded letters. Positions: R at 1? Position 1 is the second letter. But we cannot put R at position 1 because we know it's not the correct position for R. In ""GROWL"", R is at position 1 (if we break down: G0, R1, O2, W3, L4). But we cannot put R at 1 because we know it's not there. Also, O is at position 2, which we know is not correct for O. So we would get - for both, but we already know that. So it doesn't give new position information.

We want to test new positions for R and O.

So we should try to put R at a position we haven't tried: 0, 2, or 4 (since 1 and 3 are tried and wrong).

Similarly for O, we haven't tried positions 0,1,3,4 (only 2 is tried and wrong).

So ideally, we put R at 0, 2, or 4 and O at 0,1,3,4 (but not 2) and in a way that they are in new positions.

Also, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another word: ""DOZER"" but E is excluded and R is at the end? ""DOZER"" has E and R at the end. But E is excluded.

""RUMOR"": has U, M, O, R. But duplicate R? And positions: R at 0 and 4? We don't know about duplicates. Also, O at position 3? That might be okay.

But let's avoid duplicates.

""ROBOT"" is out because of T.

""ROBIN"" is out because of N.

""ROUGE"" has E.

""ROWDY"" is a valid word and uses W, D, Y which are not tested.

Another option: ""ROYAL"" but A is excluded.

""ROUND"" has N and D? N is excluded.

""FROST"" has S and T, excluded.

""CRONY"" has C and N, excluded.

So ""ROWDY"" seems a good candidate.

But let me think of another: ""GROUT"" has T, excluded.

""BROWN"" has N, excluded.

""GROWL"" has R at position 1, which we cannot use.

What about ""MOURN""? Has U, but N is excluded.

""DOUGH"" has D, O, U, G, H. But no R? We must include R because we know R is in the word. So we have to include R.

So the word must contain R and O.

Another word: ""FJORD"" has F, J, O, R, D. Avoids excluded letters. Positions: F0, J1, O2, R3, D4.

But O is at position 2: we know O cannot be at position 2 (from SPORT feedback). So if we use this, O at 2 would be marked as wrong position, which we already know. So it doesn't help.

Similarly, R is at position 3: we know R cannot be at position 3 (from SPORT feedback). So again, we get no new position information for R and O.

We want to avoid that.

So we need a word where:
- R is at 0, 2, or 4 (new positions to test)
- O is at 0,1,3, or 4 (but not 2)

And the word must be valid.

""ROWDY"": R at 0, O at 1, W at 2, D at 3, Y at 4. This satisfies:
- R at 0: new position
- O at 1: new position (we haven't tried O at 1 before)

We haven't tried O at position 1, so it's a good test.

Similarly, we test W, D, Y.

Another possibility: ""ROBED"" but E is excluded.

""RULED"" has E and L, U, D. E excluded.

""RIFLE"" has E and F, L. E excluded.

""RHYME"" has E, H, Y, M. E excluded.

""ROBOT"" excluded.

""ROWDY"" seems one of the few options.

""ROWED"" has E, excluded.

""ROWDY"" is valid.

Another word: ""ROYAL"" has A, excluded.

""ROBES"" has E and S, excluded.

So I think ""ROWDY"" is a good choice.

But let me confirm the letters: R, O, W, D, Y. None of these are excluded (excluded are C,A,N,E,S,P,T).

So yes.

We can also consider ""DOLLY"" but no R.

Must have R.

""WORDY"": W, O, R, D, Y. This is also a word.

Positions: W0, O1, R2, D3, Y4.

Now, check constraints:
- R is at position 2: which is a new position (we haven't tried R at 2 before). We tried R at 1 and 3, so 2 is new.
- O is at position 1: which is new (we only tried O at 2 before, which was wrong).

So ""WORDY"" also satisfies.

Now, between ""ROWDY"" and ""WORDY"", which one to choose?

""ROWDY"": R at 0, O at 1
""WORDY"": W at 0, O at 1, R at 2

Both test O at 1 and R at a new position (0 or 2).

But ""WORDY"" has R at 2, which is the middle, and we haven't tested that. Also, in ""ROWDY"", R is at 0, which is the first letter.

We don't have a strong preference, but note that in ""WORDY"", we are testing W at 0 and D at 3, Y at 4, same as ""ROWDY"" but with different arrangement.

But ""WORDY"" might be less common? But it's a valid word.

Another point: we know that in the secret word, R cannot be at 1 or 3, so position 2 is a possibility. Similarly, position 0 and 4.

I think both are acceptable.

But let's see the commonality. ""ROWDY"" is more common than ""WORDY""? Not sure.

We can choose ""WORDY"" to test R in the middle.

But I recall that in Wordle, common words are better, but both are valid.

To break the tie, note that in ""ROWDY"", we have R at 0 and O at 1, which are adjacent. In ""WORDY"", O and R are adjacent at positions 1 and 2. But that might not matter.

Another word: ""DOZER"" excluded.

""FJORD"" has O at 2, which we cannot use.

I think ""WORDY"" is fine.

But let me check: ""WORDY"" is an adjective meaning using too many words, so it's valid.

Similarly, ""ROWDY"" is also valid.

I'll go with ""WORDY"" because it tests R at position 2, which we haven't tried, and O at position 1.

So guess: ""WORDY""

But let's write it in uppercase: ""WORDY""

Now, to summarize:

We are guessing ""WORDY"" to test:
- R at position 2 (new position)
- O at position 1 (new position)
- And letters W, D, Y which are new.

We hope to get feedback that might confirm positions for R and O or reveal new letters.

If we get a correct for R or O, that would be great.

But even if not, we'll know more about the positions.

So, third guess: WORDY
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
  - R is in the word but not in position 1 (second letter).  
  - C, A, N, E are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: SPORT** → Feedback: S(x), P(x), O(-), R(-), T(x)  
  - O is in the word but not in position 2 (third letter).  
  - R is in the word but not in position 3 (fourth letter).  
  - S, P, T are not in the word.  

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed in the word**: R and O must appear, but with position constraints:  
  - R cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (index 1 or 3, 0-indexed).  
  - O cannot be in position 2 (index 2).  
- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, E, S, P, T (cannot appear in the word).  
- **Remaining positions for R**: 0, 2, or 4 (first, third, or fifth letter).  
- **Remaining positions for O**: 0, 1, 3, or 4 (first, second, fourth, or fifth letter).  
- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding the 7 known absent letters).  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test R in a new position (not 1 or 3) and O in a new position (not 2) to gather more positional information.  
- Prioritize positions:  
  - Place R at position 2 (index 2) to test the center, as it hasn't been tried yet.  
  - Place O at position 1 (index 1) to test the second letter position, which is new for O.  
- Include new high-frequency letters (e.g., W, D, Y) to maximize information gain.  
- Avoid excluded letters and duplicate letters (since no duplicates have been indicated yet).  

The word **""WORDY""** fits these criteria:  
- W (position 0), O (position 1), R (position 2), D (position 3), Y (position 4).  
- Tests R at position 2 (new) and O at position 1 (new).  
- Introduces W, D, and Y as new letters.  
- Valid English word (adjective, meaning ""using too many words"").  

This guess will help narrow down the positions of R and O and reveal if any of W, D, or Y are in the word.

<guess>WORDY</guess>",WORDY,"We have two guesses and their feedback:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: x (not in word)
- R: - (in word, wrong position)
- A: x (not in word)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: x (not in word)

From this, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter R, but not in the second position (index 1, if we index from 0).
- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: SPORT
- S: x (not in word)
- P: x (not in word)
- O: - (in word, wrong position)
- R: - (in word, wrong position)
- T: x (not in word)

From this, we know:
- The secret word contains O and R, but not in the positions they were guessed (O was in position 2, R was in position 3).
- The letters S, P, T are not in the word.

Combining the information:
- Letters not in the word: C, A, N, E, S, P, T
- Letters in the word: R and O (and we know they are not in positions 1 and 3 for R? Let's clarify positions).

Position indices (0-indexed for clarity):
- CRANE: positions 0:C, 1:R, 2:A, 3:N, 4:E
- SPORT: positions 0:S, 1:P, 2:O, 3:R, 4:T

From CRANE: R is in the word but not at position 1.
From SPORT: R is in the word but not at position 3, and O is in the word but not at position 2.

So R is in the word, but not at index 1 or 3. Therefore, R must be at one of the positions: 0, 2, or 4? But wait, we have 5 positions: 0,1,2,3,4.

But note: in CRANE, R was at position 1 (which is the second letter) and we know it's not there. In SPORT, R was at position 3 (the fourth letter) and it's not there. So R cannot be at position 1 or 3. Therefore, R must be at position 0, 2, or 4.

Similarly, O is in the word but not at position 2 (from SPORT). So O must be at position 0, 1, 3, or 4? But we have to consider the constraints.

Also, we know the following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, E, S, P, T.

So the secret word must contain R and O, and three other letters that are not in the excluded set.

We have 6 tries, and we are on the third guess.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Includes R and O (both must appear, but not at the positions we've already tried for them)
- Excludes C, A, N, E, S, P, T
- Tries to place R in one of the positions 0, 2, or 4 (since it can't be at 1 or 3)
- Tries to place O in a position that is not 2 (so 0,1,3,4) but note that if we place O at a position, we have to avoid the positions we know are wrong for R? They are independent.

But also, we want to test new letters to get more information.

What letters are left? We have the alphabet minus the excluded ones.

Excluded: C, A, N, E, S, P, T

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: O and R are already known to be in the word, so we need to include them.

We also want to use common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.

Common letters: among the available, we have B, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, U, etc.

We need to form a word that has R and O, and three other letters from the available set.

Moreover, we have constraints on the positions for R and O.

Let me think of words that have R and O, without the excluded letters.

For example, words like:
- FLOUR: but has F, L, O, U, R. But we have to check positions. Also, we don't know about F, L, U.
- BROIL: B, R, O, I, L. This might work.

But we need to assign positions.

We know R cannot be at position 1 or 3. So in the word we guess, we should avoid putting R at 1 or 3.

Similarly, O cannot be at position 2.

So for the next guess, we can try to put R at position 0 (the first letter) and O at position 4 (the last), for example, to test new positions.

But we have to form a valid word.

Let me list possible words:

Option 1: R at position 0, O at position 1? But position 1: we know from CRANE that R was at position 1 and it was wrong, but that doesn't say anything about O. However, we have to avoid putting R at 1, but O can be at 1.

But we don't have a constraint that O cannot be at 1. Only that it cannot be at 2.

So possible:

- R at 0, O at 1: e.g., ""ROBOT"" but has B and T? T is excluded. So not.

""ROBOT"" has T, which is excluded.

""ROOMY"" has O repeated and Y, but we don't know about Y. Also, O repeated? We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but we can avoid for now.

""ROWDY"": R, O, W, D, Y. Avoids excluded letters? W, D, Y are not excluded. So ""ROWDY"" is a candidate.

Positions: R at 0, O at 1, W at 2, D at 3, Y at 4.

But we have to check the constraints for R and O:
- R is at 0: which is allowed (not 1 or 3).
- O is at 1: which is allowed (only constraint is not at 2).

So that's okay.

But we are testing O at position 1 and R at position 0.

Another option: put R at position 2 and O at position 4.

For example, ""BROOD"" has O repeated and D, but B is allowed? ""BROOD"": B, R, O, O, D. But duplicate O? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, O is at position 2? But we know O cannot be at position 2 (from SPORT feedback). So if we put O at position 2, it would be wrong, but we already know that. So it's a waste of a position. We should avoid putting O at position 2.

Similarly, we should avoid putting R at positions 1 and 3.

So in our next guess, we should avoid:
- R at positions 1 and 3
- O at position 2

Now, back to ""ROWDY"": it uses R at 0, O at 1, and new letters W, D, Y.

But we don't know if W, D, Y are in the word. It's a good way to test them.

Another word: ""ROGUE"" but E is excluded.

""ROBIN"": R, O, B, I, N. But N is excluded (from CRANE: N is not in the word). So invalid.

""ROOMY"": O repeated and we don't know about duplicates. Also, Y is at the end.

But let's avoid duplicates for now.

""ROWDY"" seems acceptable.

Another word: ""FROWN"": F, R, O, W, N. But N is excluded.

""GROWL"": G, R, O, W, L. This avoids excluded letters. Positions: R at 1? Position 1 is the second letter. But we cannot put R at position 1 because we know it's not the correct position for R. In ""GROWL"", R is at position 1 (if we break down: G0, R1, O2, W3, L4). But we cannot put R at 1 because we know it's not there. Also, O is at position 2, which we know is not correct for O. So we would get - for both, but we already know that. So it doesn't give new position information.

We want to test new positions for R and O.

So we should try to put R at a position we haven't tried: 0, 2, or 4 (since 1 and 3 are tried and wrong).

Similarly for O, we haven't tried positions 0,1,3,4 (only 2 is tried and wrong).

So ideally, we put R at 0, 2, or 4 and O at 0,1,3,4 (but not 2) and in a way that they are in new positions.

Also, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another word: ""DOZER"" but E is excluded and R is at the end? ""DOZER"" has E and R at the end. But E is excluded.

""RUMOR"": has U, M, O, R. But duplicate R? And positions: R at 0 and 4? We don't know about duplicates. Also, O at position 3? That might be okay.

But let's avoid duplicates.

""ROBOT"" is out because of T.

""ROBIN"" is out because of N.

""ROUGE"" has E.

""ROWDY"" is a valid word and uses W, D, Y which are not tested.

Another option: ""ROYAL"" but A is excluded.

""ROUND"" has N and D? N is excluded.

""FROST"" has S and T, excluded.

""CRONY"" has C and N, excluded.

So ""ROWDY"" seems a good candidate.

But let me think of another: ""GROUT"" has T, excluded.

""BROWN"" has N, excluded.

""GROWL"" has R at position 1, which we cannot use.

What about ""MOURN""? Has U, but N is excluded.

""DOUGH"" has D, O, U, G, H. But no R? We must include R because we know R is in the word. So we have to include R.

So the word must contain R and O.

Another word: ""FJORD"" has F, J, O, R, D. Avoids excluded letters. Positions: F0, J1, O2, R3, D4.

But O is at position 2: we know O cannot be at position 2 (from SPORT feedback). So if we use this, O at 2 would be marked as wrong position, which we already know. So it doesn't help.

Similarly, R is at position 3: we know R cannot be at position 3 (from SPORT feedback). So again, we get no new position information for R and O.

We want to avoid that.

So we need a word where:
- R is at 0, 2, or 4 (new positions to test)
- O is at 0,1,3, or 4 (but not 2)

And the word must be valid.

""ROWDY"": R at 0, O at 1, W at 2, D at 3, Y at 4. This satisfies:
- R at 0: new position
- O at 1: new position (we haven't tried O at 1 before)

We haven't tried O at position 1, so it's a good test.

Similarly, we test W, D, Y.

Another possibility: ""ROBED"" but E is excluded.

""RULED"" has E and L, U, D. E excluded.

""RIFLE"" has E and F, L. E excluded.

""RHYME"" has E, H, Y, M. E excluded.

""ROBOT"" excluded.

""ROWDY"" seems one of the few options.

""ROWED"" has E, excluded.

""ROWDY"" is valid.

Another word: ""ROYAL"" has A, excluded.

""ROBES"" has E and S, excluded.

So I think ""ROWDY"" is a good choice.

But let me confirm the letters: R, O, W, D, Y. None of these are excluded (excluded are C,A,N,E,S,P,T).

So yes.

We can also consider ""DOLLY"" but no R.

Must have R.

""WORDY"": W, O, R, D, Y. This is also a word.

Positions: W0, O1, R2, D3, Y4.

Now, check constraints:
- R is at position 2: which is a new position (we haven't tried R at 2 before). We tried R at 1 and 3, so 2 is new.
- O is at position 1: which is new (we only tried O at 2 before, which was wrong).

So ""WORDY"" also satisfies.

Now, between ""ROWDY"" and ""WORDY"", which one to choose?

""ROWDY"": R at 0, O at 1
""WORDY"": W at 0, O at 1, R at 2

Both test O at 1 and R at a new position (0 or 2).

But ""WORDY"" has R at 2, which is the middle, and we haven't tested that. Also, in ""ROWDY"", R is at 0, which is the first letter.

We don't have a strong preference, but note that in ""WORDY"", we are testing W at 0 and D at 3, Y at 4, same as ""ROWDY"" but with different arrangement.

But ""WORDY"" might be less common? But it's a valid word.

Another point: we know that in the secret word, R cannot be at 1 or 3, so position 2 is a possibility. Similarly, position 0 and 4.

I think both are acceptable.

But let's see the commonality. ""ROWDY"" is more common than ""WORDY""? Not sure.

We can choose ""WORDY"" to test R in the middle.

But I recall that in Wordle, common words are better, but both are valid.

To break the tie, note that in ""ROWDY"", we have R at 0 and O at 1, which are adjacent. In ""WORDY"", O and R are adjacent at positions 1 and 2. But that might not matter.

Another word: ""DOZER"" excluded.

""FJORD"" has O at 2, which we cannot use.

I think ""WORDY"" is fine.

But let me check: ""WORDY"" is an adjective meaning using too many words, so it's valid.

Similarly, ""ROWDY"" is also valid.

I'll go with ""WORDY"" because it tests R at position 2, which we haven't tried, and O at position 1.

So guess: ""WORDY""

But let's write it in uppercase: ""WORDY""

Now, to summarize:

We are guessing ""WORDY"" to test:
- R at position 2 (new position)
- O at position 1 (new position)
- And letters W, D, Y which are new.

We hope to get feedback that might confirm positions for R and O or reveal new letters.

If we get a correct for R or O, that would be great.

But even if not, we'll know more about the positions.

So, third guess: WORDYBased on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
  - R is in the word but not in position 1 (second letter).  
  - C, A, N, E are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: SPORT** → Feedback: S(x), P(x), O(-), R(-), T(x)  
  - O is in the word but not in position 2 (third letter).  
  - R is in the word but not in position 3 (fourth letter).  
  - S, P, T are not in the word.  

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed in the word**: R and O must appear, but with position constraints:  
  - R cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (index 1 or 3, 0-indexed).  
  - O cannot be in position 2 (index 2).  
- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, E, S, P, T (cannot appear in the word).  
- **Remaining positions for R**: 0, 2, or 4 (first, third, or fifth letter).  
- **Remaining positions for O**: 0, 1, 3, or 4 (first, second, fourth, or fifth letter).  
- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding the 7 known absent letters).  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test R in a new position (not 1 or 3) and O in a new position (not 2) to gather more positional information.  
- Prioritize positions:  
  - Place R at position 2 (index 2) to test the center, as it hasn't been tried yet.  
  - Place O at position 1 (index 1) to test the second letter position, which is new for O.  
- Include new high-frequency letters (e.g., W, D, Y) to maximize information gain.  
- Avoid excluded letters and duplicate letters (since no duplicates have been indicated yet).  

The word **""WORDY""** fits these criteria:  
- W (position 0), O (position 1), R (position 2), D (position 3), Y (position 4).  
- Tests R at position 2 (new) and O at position 1 (new).  
- Introduces W, D, and Y as new letters.  
- Valid English word (adjective, meaning ""using too many words"").  

This guess will help narrow down the positions of R and O and reveal if any of W, D, or Y are in the word.",Guess 3: WORDY -> FEEDBACK: W(x) O(-) R(✓) D(x) Y(x),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a guess that maximizes the information gained.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid duplicates to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", etc. Let me choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.
 After we get the feedback, we can use it to narrow down the possibilities.<thinking>
As this is my first guess, I don't have any prior feedback to work with. The optimal approach is to choose a starting word that maximizes information gain by including:
- Common English letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words (E, A, R, S, T, etc.)
- A mix of vowels and consonants to cover more possibilities
- No repeating letters to check more distinct characters

Considering these principles, ""CRANE"" is an excellent first guess because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, E) and 2 common consonants (C, R, N)
2. All letters are distinct, testing 5 different characters
3. Frequently used as an opener in word games due to its balanced letter distribution

After submitting ""CRANE"", I'll analyze the feedback pattern (✓,-,x) to identify matching letters and positions, which will guide my next guess.
</thinking>

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"": 
C: x (not in the word)
R: - (in the word but wrong position)
A: x (not in the word)
N: x (not in the word)
E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since in CRANE, R is at position 2, and it's marked as wrong position).
- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter R, but not in the second position. Also, it does not contain C, A, N, E.

We have 6 tries and this was the first guess. Now we need to make a second guess.

We should choose a word that:
- Includes R (since we know it's in the word) and places it in a different position than the second (because in the first guess it was in the second and was wrong).
- Avoids the letters C, A, N, E (since they are not in the word).
- Uses other common letters to maximize the chance of getting more information.

Possible positions for R: since it's not in position 2, it could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

We also know the word is 5 letters and must be a valid English word.

Let's think of words that have R in one of the positions 1, 3, 4, 5 and avoid C, A, N, E.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, etc.

A good second guess might be a word that has R and several of these new letters.

For example, let's consider words starting with S or T, as they are common.

We can try to put R in the first position? But note: we don't know if R is in the first position or not. We only know it's not in the second.

But we can try a word that has R in a different position.

Let me list some words that have R and avoid C, A, N, E.

Example: ""ROUST"" - but that has U and O, which we haven't tested. But let's see.

Alternatively, ""TRIES"" - but that has E, which we know is not in the word. So we must avoid E.

We must avoid E because it was marked as not present.

So, we need a word without C, A, N, E.

Let me think of words with R and without these letters.

Common words: 
- ""SPORT"": has S, P, O, R, T. R is at position 4. But we don't know if O is in the word or not.
- ""STORM"": has S, T, O, R, M. R is at position 4. Also, we avoid C, A, N, E.

But note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates yet.

Another idea: ""DRUID"" - but D is a new letter, but we have to avoid A and E? ""DRUID"" has D, R, U, I, D? Wait, duplicate D? Also, it has U and I which are new.

But we know R is in the word, so we can try to use it.

But perhaps we can choose a word that has R and many common consonants and vowels that we haven't tried.

Vowels we haven't tried: O, I, U (and sometimes Y, but let's avoid Y for now).

We know the word must have at least one R, and we have 5 positions to fill without C, A, N, E.

Let me try to come up with a word that has R and uses common letters.

One classic word is ""ROUND"", but that has O, U, N, D. But N is not allowed (we know N is not in the word). So we cannot use N.

So avoid N.

Another: ""PROUD"" - has P, R, O, U, D. R is at position 2? But wait, in our first guess, R was at position 2 and it was marked as wrong position. So if we put R at position 2 again, it would still be wrong? But we don't know if the secret word has R at position 2 or not? Actually, the feedback for the first guess said R is in the word but not at position 2. So if we put R at position 2 again, it would still be marked as wrong position (if the correct position is not 2) or correct if it is? But we know it's not at position 2? Actually, the feedback only tells us that in the first guess, R was not at the correct position. But it might be that the secret word has R at position 2? No, because if it were at position 2, it would have been marked as correct (✓). But it was marked as wrong position (-), meaning R is in the word but not at position 2. Therefore, position 2 is definitely not the correct position for R.

So if we put R at position 2 again, it would still be marked as wrong position (unless the secret word has two R's and one of them is at position 2? But we don't know about duplicates). However, to avoid confusion, it might be better to put R in a different position to test a new spot.

But we don't have to avoid position 2 for R? Actually, we know that position 2 is not correct for R, so if we put R at position 2 again, we will get the same feedback (wrong position) and we don't gain new information about the position. So it's better to try R in a new position.

Therefore, for the second guess, we should put R in one of the positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Let me try to form a word without C, A, N, E and with R in a new position.

For example, position 1: R at the start.

Words: ""ROAST"" - but has A, which is not allowed. Avoid A.

""ROOST"" - has O, O, S, T. But O is repeated? And we don't know about O. Also, it has O and S, T.

But we avoid A, but O is new.

""ROOTS"" - similar.

But we can use ""ROILS"" or ""ROUPS"" but not common.

Another: ""RISKY"" - has R at position 1, I, S, K, Y. Avoids C, A, N, E. But Y is less common.

Alternatively, position 3: for example, ""BORED"" - but has E, which is not allowed.

""FORTS"" - has F, O, R, T, S. R is at position 3. Avoids C, A, N, E.

""PORTS"" - similar.

Position 4: ""SPORT"", as I thought earlier.

Position 5: ""LATER"" - but has A and E, not allowed.

""RUMOR"" - has U, M, O, R. R at the end? But also R at the beginning? Duplicate R.

We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but we can avoid for now.

After considering, I think ""SPORT"" is a good candidate:
- S, P, O, R, T
- R is at position 4 (a new position, not 2)
- Avoids C, A, N, E
- Uses common letters: S, P, O, T

Another candidate: ""STORM"" - similar, with R at position 4 and M instead of P.

But we might get more information with ""SPORT"" or ""STORM"".

Alternatively, ""TRIPS"" - has T, R, I, P, S. R at position 2? But we don't want to put R at position 2 again because we know it's not correct and we won't get new position info.

In ""TRIPS"", R is at position 2. We know position 2 is not correct for R, so we would get the same feedback for R (wrong position) and we don't learn a new position. So it's better to avoid position 2 for R in this guess.

Therefore, let's avoid words with R at position 2.

So, ""SPORT"" has R at position 4.

Similarly, ""DRIPS"" has R at position 3? D, R, I, P, S. But we don't know about D.

But ""DRIPS"" has R at position 2? No: D is position 1, R is position 2. So that's position 2 again. We don't want that.

How about ""GRIPS""? G is new, but R is at position 2 again.

We want R not at position 2.

So let's look for words with R at 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Another word: ""PURSE"" - but has E, not allowed.

""BIRDS"" - has B, I, R, D, S. R is at position 3. Avoids C, A, N, E.

But B is new.

""FIRST"" - F, I, R, S, T. R at position 3. Avoids C, A, N, E.

Similarly, ""THIRD"" - T, H, I, R, D. R at position 4.

But we have to choose one.

I think ""FIRST"" is a good choice because it has common letters: F, I, S, T and R at position 3.

But F is not the most common, but it's okay.

Alternatively, ""SPORT"" is also good.

To maximize vowel information, we can include a vowel we haven't tried. We haven't tried O, I, U.

In ""SPORT"", we have O. In ""FIRST"", we have I.

Both are good.

I'll go with ""SPORT"" because it has O, which is a common vowel, and we get to test S, P, O, T as well.

So, second guess: ""SPORT""

We hope to get feedback on these letters.

If we get a correct position for R, that would be great. But if not, we'll know more.

So, let's choose ""SPORT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, A, N, E are not in the secret word (marked as ""x"").
- R is in the word but not in the second position (marked as ""-"").

For the second guess, I need to:
- Include R (since it's in the secret word) but avoid placing it in the second position again to test a new location.
- Exclude C, A, N, E entirely.
- Use other common letters to maximize information gain (e.g., S, T, O, P).

I chose ""SPORT"" because:
- It places R in the fourth position (a new location to test).
- It avoids C, A, N, E and introduces new common letters: S, P, O, T.
- This combination helps test for vowels (O) and frequent consonants, providing broad coverage.

<guess>SPORT</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SPORT -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(-) R(-) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two guesses and their feedback:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: x (not in word)
- R: - (in word, wrong position)
- A: x (not in word)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: x (not in word)

From this, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter R, but not in the second position (index 1, if we index from 0).
- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: SPORT
- S: x (not in word)
- P: x (not in word)
- O: - (in word, wrong position)
- R: - (in word, wrong position)
- T: x (not in word)

From this, we know:
- The secret word contains O and R, but not in the positions they were guessed (O was in position 2, R was in position 3).
- The letters S, P, T are not in the word.

Combining the information:
- Letters not in the word: C, A, N, E, S, P, T
- Letters in the word: R and O (and we know they are not in positions 1 and 3 for R? Let's clarify positions).

Position indices (0-indexed for clarity):
- CRANE: positions 0:C, 1:R, 2:A, 3:N, 4:E
- SPORT: positions 0:S, 1:P, 2:O, 3:R, 4:T

From CRANE: R is in the word but not at position 1.
From SPORT: R is in the word but not at position 3, and O is in the word but not at position 2.

So R is in the word, but not at index 1 or 3. Therefore, R must be at one of the positions: 0, 2, or 4? But wait, we have 5 positions: 0,1,2,3,4.

But note: in CRANE, R was at position 1 (which is the second letter) and we know it's not there. In SPORT, R was at position 3 (the fourth letter) and it's not there. So R cannot be at position 1 or 3. Therefore, R must be at position 0, 2, or 4.

Similarly, O is in the word but not at position 2 (from SPORT). So O must be at position 0, 1, 3, or 4? But we have to consider the constraints.

Also, we know the following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, E, S, P, T.

So the secret word must contain R and O, and three other letters that are not in the excluded set.

We have 6 tries, and we are on the third guess.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Includes R and O (both must appear, but not at the positions we've already tried for them)
- Excludes C, A, N, E, S, P, T
- Tries to place R in one of the positions 0, 2, or 4 (since it can't be at 1 or 3)
- Tries to place O in a position that is not 2 (so 0,1,3,4) but note that if we place O at a position, we have to avoid the positions we know are wrong for R? They are independent.

But also, we want to test new letters to get more information.

What letters are left? We have the alphabet minus the excluded ones.

Excluded: C, A, N, E, S, P, T

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: O and R are already known to be in the word, so we need to include them.

We also want to use common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.

Common letters: among the available, we have B, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, U, etc.

We need to form a word that has R and O, and three other letters from the available set.

Moreover, we have constraints on the positions for R and O.

Let me think of words that have R and O, without the excluded letters.

For example, words like:
- FLOUR: but has F, L, O, U, R. But we have to check positions. Also, we don't know about F, L, U.
- BROIL: B, R, O, I, L. This might work.

But we need to assign positions.

We know R cannot be at position 1 or 3. So in the word we guess, we should avoid putting R at 1 or 3.

Similarly, O cannot be at position 2.

So for the next guess, we can try to put R at position 0 (the first letter) and O at position 4 (the last), for example, to test new positions.

But we have to form a valid word.

Let me list possible words:

Option 1: R at position 0, O at position 1? But position 1: we know from CRANE that R was at position 1 and it was wrong, but that doesn't say anything about O. However, we have to avoid putting R at 1, but O can be at 1.

But we don't have a constraint that O cannot be at 1. Only that it cannot be at 2.

So possible:

- R at 0, O at 1: e.g., ""ROBOT"" but has B and T? T is excluded. So not.

""ROBOT"" has T, which is excluded.

""ROOMY"" has O repeated and Y, but we don't know about Y. Also, O repeated? We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but we can avoid for now.

""ROWDY"": R, O, W, D, Y. Avoids excluded letters? W, D, Y are not excluded. So ""ROWDY"" is a candidate.

Positions: R at 0, O at 1, W at 2, D at 3, Y at 4.

But we have to check the constraints for R and O:
- R is at 0: which is allowed (not 1 or 3).
- O is at 1: which is allowed (only constraint is not at 2).

So that's okay.

But we are testing O at position 1 and R at position 0.

Another option: put R at position 2 and O at position 4.

For example, ""BROOD"" has O repeated and D, but B is allowed? ""BROOD"": B, R, O, O, D. But duplicate O? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, O is at position 2? But we know O cannot be at position 2 (from SPORT feedback). So if we put O at position 2, it would be wrong, but we already know that. So it's a waste of a position. We should avoid putting O at position 2.

Similarly, we should avoid putting R at positions 1 and 3.

So in our next guess, we should avoid:
- R at positions 1 and 3
- O at position 2

Now, back to ""ROWDY"": it uses R at 0, O at 1, and new letters W, D, Y.

But we don't know if W, D, Y are in the word. It's a good way to test them.

Another word: ""ROGUE"" but E is excluded.

""ROBIN"": R, O, B, I, N. But N is excluded (from CRANE: N is not in the word). So invalid.

""ROOMY"": O repeated and we don't know about duplicates. Also, Y is at the end.

But let's avoid duplicates for now.

""ROWDY"" seems acceptable.

Another word: ""FROWN"": F, R, O, W, N. But N is excluded.

""GROWL"": G, R, O, W, L. This avoids excluded letters. Positions: R at 1? Position 1 is the second letter. But we cannot put R at position 1 because we know it's not the correct position for R. In ""GROWL"", R is at position 1 (if we break down: G0, R1, O2, W3, L4). But we cannot put R at 1 because we know it's not there. Also, O is at position 2, which we know is not correct for O. So we would get - for both, but we already know that. So it doesn't give new position information.

We want to test new positions for R and O.

So we should try to put R at a position we haven't tried: 0, 2, or 4 (since 1 and 3 are tried and wrong).

Similarly for O, we haven't tried positions 0,1,3,4 (only 2 is tried and wrong).

So ideally, we put R at 0, 2, or 4 and O at 0,1,3,4 (but not 2) and in a way that they are in new positions.

Also, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another word: ""DOZER"" but E is excluded and R is at the end? ""DOZER"" has E and R at the end. But E is excluded.

""RUMOR"": has U, M, O, R. But duplicate R? And positions: R at 0 and 4? We don't know about duplicates. Also, O at position 3? That might be okay.

But let's avoid duplicates.

""ROBOT"" is out because of T.

""ROBIN"" is out because of N.

""ROUGE"" has E.

""ROWDY"" is a valid word and uses W, D, Y which are not tested.

Another option: ""ROYAL"" but A is excluded.

""ROUND"" has N and D? N is excluded.

""FROST"" has S and T, excluded.

""CRONY"" has C and N, excluded.

So ""ROWDY"" seems a good candidate.

But let me think of another: ""GROUT"" has T, excluded.

""BROWN"" has N, excluded.

""GROWL"" has R at position 1, which we cannot use.

What about ""MOURN""? Has U, but N is excluded.

""DOUGH"" has D, O, U, G, H. But no R? We must include R because we know R is in the word. So we have to include R.

So the word must contain R and O.

Another word: ""FJORD"" has F, J, O, R, D. Avoids excluded letters. Positions: F0, J1, O2, R3, D4.

But O is at position 2: we know O cannot be at position 2 (from SPORT feedback). So if we use this, O at 2 would be marked as wrong position, which we already know. So it doesn't help.

Similarly, R is at position 3: we know R cannot be at position 3 (from SPORT feedback). So again, we get no new position information for R and O.

We want to avoid that.

So we need a word where:
- R is at 0, 2, or 4 (new positions to test)
- O is at 0,1,3, or 4 (but not 2)

And the word must be valid.

""ROWDY"": R at 0, O at 1, W at 2, D at 3, Y at 4. This satisfies:
- R at 0: new position
- O at 1: new position (we haven't tried O at 1 before)

We haven't tried O at position 1, so it's a good test.

Similarly, we test W, D, Y.

Another possibility: ""ROBED"" but E is excluded.

""RULED"" has E and L, U, D. E excluded.

""RIFLE"" has E and F, L. E excluded.

""RHYME"" has E, H, Y, M. E excluded.

""ROBOT"" excluded.

""ROWDY"" seems one of the few options.

""ROWED"" has E, excluded.

""ROWDY"" is valid.

Another word: ""ROYAL"" has A, excluded.

""ROBES"" has E and S, excluded.

So I think ""ROWDY"" is a good choice.

But let me confirm the letters: R, O, W, D, Y. None of these are excluded (excluded are C,A,N,E,S,P,T).

So yes.

We can also consider ""DOLLY"" but no R.

Must have R.

""WORDY"": W, O, R, D, Y. This is also a word.

Positions: W0, O1, R2, D3, Y4.

Now, check constraints:
- R is at position 2: which is a new position (we haven't tried R at 2 before). We tried R at 1 and 3, so 2 is new.
- O is at position 1: which is new (we only tried O at 2 before, which was wrong).

So ""WORDY"" also satisfies.

Now, between ""ROWDY"" and ""WORDY"", which one to choose?

""ROWDY"": R at 0, O at 1
""WORDY"": W at 0, O at 1, R at 2

Both test O at 1 and R at a new position (0 or 2).

But ""WORDY"" has R at 2, which is the middle, and we haven't tested that. Also, in ""ROWDY"", R is at 0, which is the first letter.

We don't have a strong preference, but note that in ""WORDY"", we are testing W at 0 and D at 3, Y at 4, same as ""ROWDY"" but with different arrangement.

But ""WORDY"" might be less common? But it's a valid word.

Another point: we know that in the secret word, R cannot be at 1 or 3, so position 2 is a possibility. Similarly, position 0 and 4.

I think both are acceptable.

But let's see the commonality. ""ROWDY"" is more common than ""WORDY""? Not sure.

We can choose ""WORDY"" to test R in the middle.

But I recall that in Wordle, common words are better, but both are valid.

To break the tie, note that in ""ROWDY"", we have R at 0 and O at 1, which are adjacent. In ""WORDY"", O and R are adjacent at positions 1 and 2. But that might not matter.

Another word: ""DOZER"" excluded.

""FJORD"" has O at 2, which we cannot use.

I think ""WORDY"" is fine.

But let me check: ""WORDY"" is an adjective meaning using too many words, so it's valid.

Similarly, ""ROWDY"" is also valid.

I'll go with ""WORDY"" because it tests R at position 2, which we haven't tried, and O at position 1.

So guess: ""WORDY""

But let's write it in uppercase: ""WORDY""

Now, to summarize:

We are guessing ""WORDY"" to test:
- R at position 2 (new position)
- O at position 1 (new position)
- And letters W, D, Y which are new.

We hope to get feedback that might confirm positions for R and O or reveal new letters.

If we get a correct for R or O, that would be great.

But even if not, we'll know more about the positions.

So, third guess: WORDYBased on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
  - R is in the word but not in position 1 (second letter).  
  - C, A, N, E are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: SPORT** → Feedback: S(x), P(x), O(-), R(-), T(x)  
  - O is in the word but not in position 2 (third letter).  
  - R is in the word but not in position 3 (fourth letter).  
  - S, P, T are not in the word.  

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed in the word**: R and O must appear, but with position constraints:  
  - R cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (index 1 or 3, 0-indexed).  
  - O cannot be in position 2 (index 2).  
- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, E, S, P, T (cannot appear in the word).  
- **Remaining positions for R**: 0, 2, or 4 (first, third, or fifth letter).  
- **Remaining positions for O**: 0, 1, 3, or 4 (first, second, fourth, or fifth letter).  
- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding the 7 known absent letters).  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test R in a new position (not 1 or 3) and O in a new position (not 2) to gather more positional information.  
- Prioritize positions:  
  - Place R at position 2 (index 2) to test the center, as it hasn't been tried yet.  
  - Place O at position 1 (index 1) to test the second letter position, which is new for O.  
- Include new high-frequency letters (e.g., W, D, Y) to maximize information gain.  
- Avoid excluded letters and duplicate letters (since no duplicates have been indicated yet).  

The word **""WORDY""** fits these criteria:  
- W (position 0), O (position 1), R (position 2), D (position 3), Y (position 4).  
- Tests R at position 2 (new) and O at position 1 (new).  
- Introduces W, D, and Y as new letters.  
- Valid English word (adjective, meaning ""using too many words"").  

This guess will help narrow down the positions of R and O and reveal if any of W, D, or Y are in the word.

The optimal approach is to choose a starting word that maximizes information gain by including:\n- Common English letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words (E, A, R, S, T, etc.)\n- A mix of vowels and consonants to cover more possibilities\n- No repeating letters to check more distinct characters\n\nConsidering these principles, ""CRANE"" is an excellent first guess because:\n1.

Also, it does not contain C, A, N, E.\n\nWe have 6 tries and this was the first guess. Now we need to make a second guess.\n\nWe should choose a word that:\n- Includes R (since we know it\'s in the word) and places it in a different position than the second (because in the first guess it was in the second and was wrong).\n- Avoids the letters C, A, N, E (since they are not in the word).\n- Uses other common letters to maximize the chance of getting more information.\n\nPossible positions for R: since it\'s not in position 2, it could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\nWe also know the word is 5 letters and must be a valid English word.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have R in one of the positions 1, 3, 4, 5 and avoid C, A, N, E.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, etc.\n\nA good second guess might be a word that has R and several of these new letters.\n\nFor example, let\'s consider words starting with S or T, as they are common.\n\nWe can try to put R in the first position? But note: we don\'t know if R is in the first position or not. We only know it\'s not in the second.\n\nBut we can try a word that has R in a different position.\n\nLet me list some words that have R and avoid C, A, N, E.\n\nExample: ""ROUST"" - but that has U and O, which we haven\'t tested. But let\'s see.\n\nAlternatively, ""TRIES"" - but that has E, which we know is not in the word. So we must avoid E.\n\nWe must avoid E because it was marked as not present.\n\nSo, we need a word without C, A, N, E.\n\nLet me think of words with R and without these letters.\n\nCommon words: \n- ""SPORT"": has S, P, O, R, T. R is at position 4. But we don\'t know if O is in the word or not.\n- ""STORM"": has S, T, O, R, M. R is at position 4. Also, we avoid C, A, N, E.\n\nBut note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have any indication of duplicates yet.\n\nAnother idea: ""DRUID"" - but D is a new letter, but we have to avoid A and E? ""DRUID"" has D, R, U, I, D? Wait, duplicate D? Also, it has U and I which are new.\n\nBut we know R is in the word, so we can try to use it.\n\nBut perhaps we can choose a word that has R and many common consonants and vowels that we haven\'t tried.\n\nVowels we haven\'t tried: O, I, U (and sometimes Y, but let\'s avoid Y for now).\n\nWe know the word must have at least one R, and we have 5 positions to fill without C, A, N, E.\n\nLet me try to come up with a word that has R and uses common letters.\n\nOne classic word is ""ROUND"", but that has O, U, N, D. But N is not allowed (we know N is not in the word). So we cannot use N.\n\nSo avoid N.\n\nAnother: ""PROUD"" - has P, R, O, U, D. R is at position 2? But wait, in our first guess, R was at position 2 and it was marked as wrong position. So if we put R at position 2 again, it would still be wrong? But we don\'t know if the secret word has R at position 2 or not? Actually, the feedback for the first guess said R is in the word but not at position 2. So if we put R at position 2 again, it would still be marked as wrong position (if the correct position is not 2) or correct if it is? But we know it\'s not at position 2? Actually, the feedback only tells us that in the first guess, R was not at the correct position. But it might be that the secret word has R at position 2? No, because if it were at position 2, it would have been marked as correct (✓). But it was marked as wrong position (-), meaning R is in the word but not at position 2. Therefore, position 2 is definitely not the correct position for R.\n\nSo if we put R at position 2 again, it would still be marked as wrong position (unless the secret word has two R\'s and one of them is at position 2? But we don\'t know about duplicates). However, to avoid confusion, it might be better to put R in a different position to test a new spot.\n\nBut we don\'t have to avoid position 2 for R? Actually, we know that position 2 is not correct for R, so if we put R at position 2 again, we will get the same feedback (wrong position) and we don\'t gain new information about the position. So it\'s better to try R in a new position.\n\nTherefore, for the second guess, we should put R in one of the positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\nLet me try to form a word without C, A, N, E and with R in a new position.\n\nFor example, position 1: R at the start.\n\nWords: ""ROAST"" - but has A, which is not allowed. Avoid A.\n\n""ROOST"" - has O, O, S, T. But O is repeated? And we don\'t know about O. Also, it has O and S, T.\n\nBut we avoid A, but O is new.\n\n""ROOTS"" - similar.\n\nBut we can use ""ROILS"" or ""ROUPS"" but not common.\n\nAnother: ""RISKY"" - has R at position 1, I, S, K, Y. Avoids C, A, N, E. But Y is less common.\n\nAlternatively, position 3: for example, ""BORED"" - but has E, which is not allowed.\n\n""FORTS"" - has F, O, R, T, S. R is at position 3. Avoids C, A, N, E.\n\n""PORTS"" - similar.\n\nPosition 4: ""SPORT"", as I thought earlier.\n\nPosition 5: ""LATER"" - but has A and E, not allowed.\n\n""RUMOR"" - has U, M, O, R. R at the end? But also R at the beginning? Duplicate R.\n\nWe don\'t know if duplicates are allowed, but we can avoid for now.\n\nAfter considering, I think ""SPORT"" is a good candidate:\n- S, P, O, R, T\n- R is at position 4 (a new position, not 2)\n- Avoids C, A, N, E\n- Uses common letters: S, P, O, T\n\nAnother candidate: ""STORM"" - similar, with R at position 4 and M instead of P.\n\nBut we might get more information with ""SPORT"" or ""STORM"".\n\nAlternatively, ""TRIPS"" - has T, R, I, P, S. R at position 2? But we don\'t want to put R at position 2 again because we know it\'s not correct and we won\'t get new position info.\n\nIn ""TRIPS"", R is at position 2. We know position 2 is not correct for R, so we would get the same feedback for R (wrong position) and we don\'t learn a new position. So it\'s better to avoid position 2 for R in this guess.\n\nTherefore, let\'s avoid words with R at position 2.\n\nSo, ""SPORT"" has R at position 4.\n\nSimilarly, ""DRIPS"" has R at position 3? D, R, I, P, S. But we don\'t know about D.\n\nBut ""DRIPS"" has R at position 2? No: D is position 1, R is position 2. So that\'s position 2 again. We don\'t want that.\n\nHow about ""GRIPS""? G is new, but R is at position 2 again.\n\nWe want R not at position 2.\n\nSo let\'s look for words with R at 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\nAnother word: ""PURSE"" - but has E, not allowed.\n\n""BIRDS"" - has B, I, R, D, S. R is at position 3. Avoids C, A, N, E.\n\nBut B is new.\n\n""FIRST"" - F, I, R, S, T. R at position 3. Avoids C, A, N, E.\n\nSimilarly, ""THIRD"" - T, H, I, R, D. R at position 4.\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nI think ""FIRST"" is a good choice because it has common letters: F, I, S, T and R at position 3.\n\nBut F is not the most common, but it\'s okay.\n\nAlternatively, ""SPORT"" is also good.\n\nTo maximize vowel information, we can include a vowel we haven\'t tried. We haven\'t tried O, I, U.\n\nIn ""SPORT"", we have O. In ""FIRST"", we have I.\n\nBoth are good.\n\nI\'ll go with ""SPORT"" because it has O, which is a common vowel, and we get to test S, P, O, T as well.\n\nSo, second guess: ""SPORT""\n\nWe hope to get feedback on these letters.\n\nIf we get a correct position for R, that would be great. But if not, we\'ll know more.\n\nSo, let\'s choose ""SPORT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- C, A, N, E are not in the secret word (marked as ""x"").\n- R is in the word but not in the second position (marked as ""-"").\n\nFor the second guess, I need to:\n- Include R (since it\'s in the secret word) but avoid placing it in the second position again to test a new location.\n- Exclude C, A, N, E entirely.\n- Use other common letters to maximize information gain (e.g., S, T, O, P).\n\nI chose ""SPORT"" because:\n- It places R in the fourth position (a new location to test).\n- It avoids C, A, N, E and introduces new common letters: S, P, O, T.\n- This combination helps test for vowels (O) and frequent consonants, providing broad coverage.\n\n<guess>SPORT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: SPORT -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(-) R(-) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two guesses and their feedback:\n\nGuess 1: CRANE\n- C: x (not in word)\n- R: - (in word, wrong position)\n- A: x (not in word)\n- N: x (not in word)\n- E: x (not in word)\n\nFrom this, we know:\n- The secret word contains the letter R, but not in the second position (index 1, if we index from 0).\n- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the word.\n\nGuess 2: SPORT\n- S: x (not in word)\n- P: x (not in word)\n- O: - (in word, wrong position)\n- R: - (in word, wrong position)\n- T: x (not in word)\n\nFrom this, we know:\n- The secret word contains O and R, but not in the positions they were guessed (O was in position 2, R was in position 3).\n- The letters S, P, T are not in the word.\n\nCombining the information:\n- Letters not in the word: C, A, N, E, S, P, T\n- Letters in the word: R and O (and we know they are not in positions 1 and 3 for R? Let\'s clarify positions).\n\nPosition indices (0-indexed for clarity):\n- CRANE: positions 0:C, 1:R, 2:A, 3:N, 4:E\n- SPORT: positions 0:S, 1:P, 2:O, 3:R, 4:T\n\nFrom CRANE: R is in the word but not at position 1.\nFrom SPORT: R is in the word but not at position 3, and O is in the word but not at position 2.\n\nSo R is in the word, but not at index 1 or 3. Therefore, R must be at one of the positions: 0, 2, or 4? But wait, we have 5 positions: 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nBut note: in CRANE, R was at position 1 (which is the second letter) and we know it\'s not there. In SPORT, R was at position 3 (the fourth letter) and it\'s not there. So R cannot be at position 1 or 3. Therefore, R must be at position 0, 2, or 4.\n\nSimilarly, O is in the word but not at position 2 (from SPORT). So O must be at position 0, 1, 3, or 4? But we have to consider the constraints.\n\nAlso, we know the following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, E, S, P, T.\n\nSo the secret word must contain R and O, and three other letters that are not in the excluded set.\n\nWe have 6 tries, and we are on the third guess.\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that:\n- Includes R and O (both must appear, but not at the positions we\'ve already tried for them)\n- Excludes C, A, N, E, S, P, T\n- Tries to place R in one of the positions 0, 2, or 4 (since it can\'t be at 1 or 3)\n- Tries to place O in a position that is not 2 (so 0,1,3,4) but note that if we place O at a position, we have to avoid the positions we know are wrong for R? They are independent.\n\nBut also, we want to test new letters to get more information.\n\nWhat letters are left? We have the alphabet minus the excluded ones.\n\nExcluded: C, A, N, E, S, P, T\n\nSo available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nBut note: O and R are already known to be in the word, so we need to include them.\n\nWe also want to use common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.\n\nCommon letters: among the available, we have B, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, U, etc.\n\nWe need to form a word that has R and O, and three other letters from the available set.\n\nMoreover, we have constraints on the positions for R and O.\n\nLet me think of words that have R and O, without the excluded letters.\n\nFor example, words like:\n- FLOUR: but has F, L, O, U, R. But we have to check positions. Also, we don\'t know about F, L, U.\n- BROIL: B, R, O, I, L. This might work.\n\nBut we need to assign positions.\n\nWe know R cannot be at position 1 or 3. So in the word we guess, we should avoid putting R at 1 or 3.\n\nSimilarly, O cannot be at position 2.\n\nSo for the next guess, we can try to put R at position 0 (the first letter) and O at position 4 (the last), for example, to test new positions.\n\nBut we have to form a valid word.\n\nLet me list possible words:\n\nOption 1: R at position 0, O at position 1? But position 1: we know from CRANE that R was at position 1 and it was wrong, but that doesn\'t say anything about O. However, we have to avoid putting R at 1, but O can be at 1.\n\nBut we don\'t have a constraint that O cannot be at 1. Only that it cannot be at 2.\n\nSo possible:\n\n- R at 0, O at 1: e.g., ""ROBOT"" but has B and T? T is excluded. So not.\n\n""ROBOT"" has T, which is excluded.\n\n""ROOMY"" has O repeated and Y, but we don\'t know about Y. Also, O repeated? We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed, but we can avoid for now.\n\n""ROWDY"": R, O, W, D, Y. Avoids excluded letters? W, D, Y are not excluded. So ""ROWDY"" is a candidate.\n\nPositions: R at 0, O at 1, W at 2, D at 3, Y at 4.\n\nBut we have to check the constraints for R and O:\n- R is at 0: which is allowed (not 1 or 3).\n- O is at 1: which is allowed (only constraint is not at 2).\n\nSo that\'s okay.\n\nBut we are testing O at position 1 and R at position 0.\n\nAnother option: put R at position 2 and O at position 4.\n\nFor example, ""BROOD"" has O repeated and D, but B is allowed? ""BROOD"": B, R, O, O, D. But duplicate O? And we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, O is at position 2? But we know O cannot be at position 2 (from SPORT feedback). So if we put O at position 2, it would be wrong, but we already know that. So it\'s a waste of a position. We should avoid putting O at position 2.\n\nSimilarly, we should avoid putting R at positions 1 and 3.\n\nSo in our next guess, we should avoid:\n- R at positions 1 and 3\n- O at position 2\n\nNow, back to ""ROWDY"": it uses R at 0, O at 1, and new letters W, D, Y.\n\nBut we don\'t know if W, D, Y are in the word. It\'s a good way to test them.\n\nAnother word: ""ROGUE"" but E is excluded.\n\n""ROBIN"": R, O, B, I, N. But N is excluded (from CRANE: N is not in the word). So invalid.\n\n""ROOMY"": O repeated and we don\'t know about duplicates. Also, Y is at the end.\n\nBut let\'s avoid duplicates for now.\n\n""ROWDY"" seems acceptable.\n\nAnother word: ""FROWN"": F, R, O, W, N. But N is excluded.\n\n""GROWL"": G, R, O, W, L. This avoids excluded letters. Positions: R at 1? Position 1 is the second letter. But we cannot put R at position 1 because we know it\'s not the correct position for R. In ""GROWL"", R is at position 1 (if we break down: G0, R1, O2, W3, L4). But we cannot put R at 1 because we know it\'s not there. Also, O is at position 2, which we know is not correct for O. So we would get - for both, but we already know that. So it doesn\'t give new position information.\n\nWe want to test new positions for R and O.\n\nSo we should try to put R at a position we haven\'t tried: 0, 2, or 4 (since 1 and 3 are tried and wrong).\n\nSimilarly for O, we haven\'t tried positions 0,1,3,4 (only 2 is tried and wrong).\n\nSo ideally, we put R at 0, 2, or 4 and O at 0,1,3,4 (but not 2) and in a way that they are in new positions.\n\nAlso, we want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nAnother word: ""DOZER"" but E is excluded and R is at the end? ""DOZER"" has E and R at the end. But E is excluded.\n\n""RUMOR"": has U, M, O, R. But duplicate R? And positions: R at 0 and 4? We don\'t know about duplicates. Also, O at position 3? That might be okay.\n\nBut let\'s avoid duplicates.\n\n""ROBOT"" is out because of T.\n\n""ROBIN"" is out because of N.\n\n""ROUGE"" has E.\n\n""ROWDY"" is a valid word and uses W, D, Y which are not tested.\n\nAnother option: ""ROYAL"" but A is excluded.\n\n""ROUND"" has N and D? N is excluded.\n\n""FROST"" has S and T, excluded.\n\n""CRONY"" has C and N, excluded.\n\nSo ""ROWDY"" seems a good candidate.\n\nBut let me think of another: ""GROUT"" has T, excluded.\n\n""BROWN"" has N, excluded.\n\n""GROWL"" has R at position 1, which we cannot use.\n\nWhat about ""MOURN""? Has U, but N is excluded.\n\n""DOUGH"" has D, O, U, G, H. But no R? We must include R because we know R is in the word. So we have to include R.\n\nSo the word must contain R and O.\n\nAnother word: ""FJORD"" has F, J, O, R, D. Avoids excluded letters. Positions: F0, J1, O2, R3, D4.\n\nBut O is at position 2: we know O cannot be at position 2 (from SPORT feedback). So if we use this, O at 2 would be marked as wrong position, which we already know. So it doesn\'t help.\n\nSimilarly, R is at position 3: we know R cannot be at position 3 (from SPORT feedback). So again, we get no new position information for R and O.\n\nWe want to avoid that.\n\nSo we need a word where:\n- R is at 0, 2, or 4 (new positions to test)\n- O is at 0,1,3, or 4 (but not 2)\n\nAnd the word must be valid.\n\n""ROWDY"": R at 0, O at 1, W at 2, D at 3, Y at 4. This satisfies:\n- R at 0: new position\n- O at 1: new position (we haven\'t tried O at 1 before)\n\nWe haven\'t tried O at position 1, so it\'s a good test.\n\nSimilarly, we test W, D, Y.\n\nAnother possibility: ""ROBED"" but E is excluded.\n\n""RULED"" has E and L, U, D. E excluded.\n\n""RIFLE"" has E and F, L. E excluded.\n\n""RHYME"" has E, H, Y, M. E excluded.\n\n""ROBOT"" excluded.\n\n""ROWDY"" seems one of the few options.\n\n""ROWED"" has E, excluded.\n\n""ROWDY"" is valid.\n\nAnother word: ""ROYAL"" has A, excluded.\n\n""ROBES"" has E and S, excluded.\n\nSo I think ""ROWDY"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me confirm the letters: R, O, W, D, Y. None of these are excluded (excluded are C,A,N,E,S,P,T).\n\nSo yes.\n\nWe can also consider ""DOLLY"" but no R.\n\nMust have R.\n\n""WORDY"": W, O, R, D, Y. This is also a word.\n\nPositions: W0, O1, R2, D3, Y4.\n\nNow, check constraints:\n- R is at position 2: which is a new position (we haven\'t tried R at 2 before). We tried R at 1 and 3, so 2 is new.\n- O is at position 1: which is new (we only tried O at 2 before, which was wrong).\n\nSo ""WORDY"" also satisfies.\n\nNow, between ""ROWDY"" and ""WORDY"", which one to choose?\n\n""ROWDY"": R at 0, O at 1\n""WORDY"": W at 0, O at 1, R at 2\n\nBoth test O at 1 and R at a new position (0 or 2).\n\nBut ""WORDY"" has R at 2, which is the middle, and we haven\'t tested that. Also, in ""ROWDY"", R is at 0, which is the first letter.\n\nWe don\'t have a strong preference, but note that in ""WORDY"", we are testing W at 0 and D at 3, Y at 4, same as ""ROWDY"" but with different arrangement.\n\nBut ""WORDY"" might be less common? But it\'s a valid word.\n\nAnother point: we know that in the secret word, R cannot be at 1 or 3, so position 2 is a possibility. Similarly, position 0 and 4.\n\nI think both are acceptable.\n\nBut let\'s see the commonality. ""ROWDY"" is more common than ""WORDY""? Not sure.\n\nWe can choose ""WORDY"" to test R in the middle.\n\nBut I recall that in Wordle, common words are better, but both are valid.\n\nTo break the tie, note that in ""ROWDY"", we have R at 0 and O at 1, which are adjacent. In ""WORDY"", O and R are adjacent at positions 1 and 2. But that might not matter.\n\nAnother word: ""DOZER"" excluded.\n\n""FJORD"" has O at 2, which we cannot use.\n\nI think ""WORDY"" is fine.\n\nBut let me check: ""WORDY"" is an adjective meaning using too many words, so it\'s valid.\n\nSimilarly, ""ROWDY"" is also valid.\n\nI\'ll go with ""WORDY"" because it tests R at position 2, which we haven\'t tried, and O at position 1.\n\nSo guess: ""WORDY""\n\nBut let\'s write it in uppercase: ""WORDY""\n\nNow, to summarize:\n\nWe are guessing ""WORDY"" to test:\n- R at position 2 (new position)\n- O at position 1 (new position)\n- And letters W, D, Y which are new.\n\nWe hope to get feedback that might confirm positions for R and O or reveal new letters.\n\nIf we get a correct for R or O, that would be great.\n\nBut even if not, we\'ll know more about the positions.\n\nSo, third guess: WORDYBased on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)  \n  - R is in the word but not in position 1 (second letter).  \n  - C, A, N, E are not in the word.  \n\n- **Guess 2: SPORT** → Feedback: S(x), P(x), O(-), R(-), T(x)  \n  - O is in the word but not in position 2 (third letter).  \n  - R is in the word but not in position 3 (fourth letter).  \n  - S, P, T are not in the word.  \n\n### Key Insights:\n- **Confirmed in the word**: R and O must appear, but with position constraints:  \n  - R cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (index 1 or 3, 0-indexed).  \n  - O cannot be in position 2 (index 2).  \n- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, E, S, P, T (cannot appear in the word).  \n- **Remaining positions for R**: 0, 2, or 4 (first, third, or fifth letter).  \n- **Remaining positions for O**: 0, 1, 3, or 4 (first, second, fourth, or fifth letter).  \n- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding the 7 known absent letters).  \n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- Test R in a new position (not 1 or 3) and O in a new position (not 2) to gather more positional information.  \n- Prioritize positions:  \n  - Place R at position 2 (index 2) to test the center, as it hasn\'t been tried yet.  \n  - Place O at position 1 (index 1) to test the second letter position, which is new for O.  \n- Include new high-frequency letters (e.g., W, D, Y) to maximize information gain.  \n- Avoid excluded letters and duplicate letters (since no duplicates have been indicated yet).  \n\nThe word **""WORDY""** fits these criteria:  \n- W (position 0), O (position 1), R (position 2), D (position 3), Y (position 4).  \n- Tests R at position 2 (new) and O at position 1 (new).  \n- Introduces W, D, and Y as new letters.  \n- Valid English word (adjective, meaning ""using too many words"").  \n\nThis guess will help narrow down the positions of R and O and reveal if any of W, D, or Y are in the word.\n\n<guess>WORDY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: SPORT -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(-) R(-) T(x)\nGuess 3: WORDY -> FEEDBACK: W(x) O(-) R(✓) D(x) Y(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have the previous feedback:

Guess 1: CRANE -> Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
- R is in the word but not in position 1 (index 1, 0-based).

Guess 2: SPORT -> Feedback: S(x) P(x) O(-) R(-) T(x)
- O is in the word but not in position 2 (index 2).
- R is in the word but not in position 3 (index 3).

Guess 3: WORDY -> Feedback: W(x) O(-) R(✓) D(x) Y(x)
- R is in the correct position! At position 2 (index 2). So the third letter is R.
- O is in the word but not in position 1 (index 1). 
- W, D, Y are not in the word.

From this, we know:
- The secret word has R as the third letter (position 2, 0-based). So the word is ? ? R ? ?.
- O is in the word, but not at position 1 (which we just tried) and not at position 2 (from Guess 2). So O must be at position 0, 3, or 4.
- Letters not in the word: C, A, N, E, S, P, T, W, D, Y (all marked 'x' in at least one guess).
- R is fixed at position 2.

Now, we need to find a word that fits:
- Third letter is R: __ __ R __ __
- Contains O somewhere, but not at position 1 or 2. So O must be at 0, 3, or 4.
- Exclude the absent letters: C, A, N, E, S, P, T, W, D, Y.

Available letters: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, R, U, V, X, Z. But R is fixed at position 2, and O must appear once (no duplicates indicated, so we assume single for now).

We need to form a word with O at position 0, 3, or 4.

Possible options:

1. O at position 0: O _ R _ _
2. O at position 3: _ _ R O _
3. O at position 4: _ _ R _ O

We need to use the available letters and form valid words.

We also have two more guesses so far (this will be fourth guess).

We want to test possible positions for O and also test more letters.

Since O has three possible positions (0,3,4), we might need to choose a word that tests O at one of these and also tests other common letters.

First, consider O at position 0: O _ R _ _

The second letter must be from available set. Similarly, last two letters.

Words: e.g., ""OGRER"" but duplicate R? And G, E? E is excluded. Duplicate R might be issue, but we don't know.

Possible words:
- ""OUIJA"" has U, I, J, A? A excluded. Invalid.
- ""OLLER"" has L, but E? Excluded. Also, duplicate L? Not good.

Better: ""OILER""? But E excluded.

""OAKER""? A and E issues.

It's hard without vowels. We have U and I available.

Another word: ""ORDER"" has E and R duplicate? E excluded.

""OUMAS""? Not common.

Perhaps O at position 0 is hard with the constraints.

Now, try O at position 3: _ _ R O _

First two letters: available letters, last letter: available.

For example:
- _ _ R O _
Possible: ""MIRRO"" not a word.
- ""FUROR"" has F, U, R, O, R? Duplicate R? And positions: F0, U1, R2, O3, R4. Duplicate R and R at position 2 (fixed) and 4? But R is fixed at 2, so having another R might be possible? We don't know. But ""FUROR"" has A? No, F,U,R,O,R. But duplicate R. And the word ends with R.

But D and Y are out, but R is allowed? Duplicates may be possible but we haven't seen one yet.

But ""FUROR"" is a word? Fury is, but furor? Yes, it's valid.

Letters: F, U, R, O; with duplicate R? In ""FUROR"", it's F-U-R-O-R, so it has R at position 2 and 4. But we know position 2 is R, so if there is another R, it might be at 4.

But we have O at position 3.

However, the word must be checked against excluded letters: F,U,R,O,R. R is allowed, but F,U,O are new. Excluded letters don't include these.

But we also have the constraint that O must not be at position 2 (which it isn't, it's at 3) and R is at 2, correct.

But duplicate R: we don't know if the word has duplicate letters, but it's possible.

Another word without duplicate: ""BIROS""? B,I,R,O,S? S excluded.

""GIRO"" is 4 letters.

""HERO"" is 4.

""KIRO"" not common.

""MURO"" not common.

""VIRO"" not common.

Perhaps ""FUROR"" is an option.

Now, O at position 4: _ _ R _ O

First two and the fourth letter.

E.g., ""BERMO""? E excluded.

""GARBO""? A excluded.

""JIRGA""? A excluded? J,I,R,G,A? A excluded, invalid.

""LIRDO""? Not familiar.

Another: ""TERRO""? E and T excluded.

It's challenging.

Perhaps ""MORRO""? M,O,R,R,O? Duplicate O and R? But R at position 2? M0, O1, R2, R3, O4. O at position 1? But in this guess, if we put O at position 1, we know from Guess 3 that O is not at position 1? In Guess 3, WORDY had O at position 1 and it was wrong position, so O is not at position 1.

So we cannot use O at position 1.

Similarly, O cannot be at position 2.

In ""MORRO"", O is at 1 and 4. But position 1 is not allowed for O, so if we try ""MORRO"", the O at 1 would be wrong, and at 4 might be correct or wrong.

But we shouldn't put O at position 1 because we know it's not there.

So for O at position 4, the word should not have O at 1 or 2.

Similarly, for other positions.

Back to O at position 3: _ _ R O _

We can try to use common letters.

Possible words:
- The first two letters: let's say B and U: ""BURRO""? B,U,R,R,O? Duplicate R and O at 3? B0, U1, R2, R3, O4? For O at position 4? I need O at position 3.

If O is at position 3, the pattern is _ _ R O _

So after R must be O, then another letter.

So ""___RO"" but the last letter is not O, it's O at the fourth position, so the word should end with something after O.

Pattern: positions: 0:?, 1:?, 2:R, 3:O, 4:?

So it must be a letter at position 4.

For example:
- ""FROWN"" has N? Excluded.
- ""BROWN"" has N? Excluded.
- ""CROOK"" has C and K? C excluded, K is available? C excluded? C is in excluded list. And O at 3? B0,R1,O2? We need R at 2, so not.

Better: ""MICRO"" M,I,C,R,O -> C excluded.

""TROOP"" T and P excluded.

Since S,P,T are excluded, avoid.

Another: ""QUERO"" not common.

Maybe ""VEROO"" not.

Perhaps ""HIRO"" is 4 letters.

""FIORD""? But that's Fjord spelling variation? And D is excluded? No, D is in excluded? D: in Guess 3, D was marked x, so D not in word.

D is excluded.

In Guess 3, WORDY had D at position 3 and it was x, so D not present.

Similarly, Y not, W not.

So excluded: C,A,N,E,S,P,T,W,D,Y

Available: B,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,Q,R,U,V,X,Z

And O must be placed.

Now, O at position 3: word pattern: _ _ R O ?

Position 4: needs a letter, say L: ""BAROL""? Not a word.

With U: ""CURIO""? C is excluded.

""BURIO"" not valid.

""FERIO"" not common.

""HERO"" too short.

""ZERO"" Z,E,R,O -> E excluded.

J: ""JERBO"" J,E,R,B,O -> E excluded.

L: ""LORRO""? Not common.

M: ""MAROO"" not.

Perhaps ""GROOF"" not valid.

This is tough.

Maybe O at position 0 is easier.

O at 0: O _ R _ _

Position 1: must be a consonant, say G: ""OGRES""? E excluded.

""OGHAM"" G,H,A,M -> A excluded.

""OGIVE"" E? Excluded.

""OGRIS"" not common.

""OLEIC"" E? Excluded.

""OLIOS"" duplicate O? And O at 0 and 4? But we don't know.

""OPING"" O at 0, P is excluded.

""OUBIT"" U,B,I,T -> T excluded.

""OUPHE"" E and U? E excluded.

Not working.

O at position 4: _ _ R _ O

For example:
- ""BURDO"" not valid.
- ""FERMO"" E excluded.
- ""GIRZO"" not.
- ""HORMO"" H,O,R,M,O? Duplicate O? And O at 1 not allowed.
- ""JARUL"" not.

Perhaps ""VIRGO"" V,I,R,G,O. Positions: V0, I1, R2, G3, O4.

Letters: V,I,G,O. All available? Excluded? V,I,G not excluded.

And O at position 4.

Also, does not have O at position 1 or 2? Yes, position 1 is I, and O at 4.

So ""VIRGO"" is a word (astrology sign).

Check against constraints:
- R at position 2: fixed and correct.
- O at position 4: we want to test O at a new position.
- Letters: V,I,G,O,R. V,I,G new.

Also, avoids excluded letters.

So it should work.

We can test if O is at position 4.

Similarly, we want to test other possibilities? But we have only one guess.

Another option: O at position 3? But we couldn't find a good word for that.

But ""FUROR"" came to mind: F,U,R,O,R? But duplicate R? And O at position 3? In ""FUROR"": F0, U1, R2, O3, R4. Yes, O at position 3.

But duplicate R at position 4? R is already at position 2, so if the word has two R's, that might be possible.

But we don't know.

""FUROR"" has R twice, but it's allowed if the secret word has multiple R's.

But so far, we have no evidence of duplicates.

""VIRGO"" only has one R.

Both are valid.

Now, which one to choose?

""VIRGO"": tests O at position 4.
""FUROR"": tests O at position 3 and possible duplicate R.

We also have to consider the letters.

In ""VIRGO"", we test V, I, G.

In ""FUROR"", we test F, U, and see if R appears again.

Both are good.

But note, in ""FUROR"", position 4 is R, which is not the fixed R; it's an additional R. And we know R is not at position 1 or 3, but position 4 hasn't been tested for R? We haven't tried R at position 4.

But we know R is in the word at position 2, so if there is a duplicate, it could be elsewhere.

But we don't have information on duplicates.

To test specifically for O's position, it's better to try ""VIRGO"" to test O at position 4 without introducing a duplicate.

Similarly, we can test O at position 3 later if needed.

Since we have limited guesses, ""VIRGO"" might be safer.

Another word for O at position 3: ""GIROS"" but S excluded.

""BIROS"" same issue.

""LIROT"" T excluded? And L,I,R,O,T. T excluded.

 Not good.

""MUROW"" W excluded.

So ""FUROR"" is one option, but it has duplicate R.

Alternatively, ""VIRGO"" is duplicate-free.

We can choose ""VIRGO"".

Also, we haven't tested V, I, G, which are common.

So I think ""VIRGO"" is a good guess.

Therefore, fourth guess: VIRGO

Position breakdown: 
- 0: V
- 1: I
- 2: R (fixed and known to be correct, so will show as ✓)
- 3: G
- 4: O

We can predict that R will be ✓, and feedback for V, I, G, O will depend.

We hope that if O is at 4, it shows correct, or else wrong position or not.

So let's go with that.
</think>
### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Current Constraints from Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
     - R is in the word but not in position 1 (0-based index: index 1).  
     - C, A, N, E are not in the word.  
   
   - **Guess 2: SPORT** → Feedback: S(x), P(x), O(-), R(-), T(x)  
     - O is in the word but not in position 2 (index 2).  
     - R is in the word but not in position 3 (index 3).  
     - S, P, T are not in the word.  
   
   - **Guess 3: WORDY** → Feedback: W(x), O(-), R(✓), D(x), Y(x)  
     - R is correct at position 2 (index 2, 0-based); the third letter is **R**. Word pattern: `_ _ R _ _ ?`.  
     - O is in the word but not in position 1 (index 1).  
     - W, D, Y are not in the word.  

2. **Key Inferences**:
   - **R Position**: Fixed at index 2 (third letter).  
     - Confirmed positions: R cannot be at index 1 (from Guess 1) or index 3 (from Guess 2), so it must be at index 2 (as now confirmed).  
   - **O Position**: Must be in the word, but not at index 1 (from WORDY feedback) or index 2 (from SPORT feedback). Remaining possible positions: index 0 (first letter), index 3 (fourth letter), or index 4 (fifth letter).  
   - **Excluded Letters**: C, A, N, E, S, P, T, W, D, Y (all marked ""x"" at least once).  
   - **Available Letters**: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, R, U, V, X, Z. R is fixed at index 2, so it cannot appear elsewhere unless duplicated (no evidence of duplicates yet). O must appear once at an untested position (0, 3, or 4).  

3. **Strategy for Guess 4**:
   - **Prioritize testing O positions**: Since O has only three possible untested positions (0, 3, 4), choose a word that tests one of these while introducing new common letters to gather more information.  
   - **Position Focus**: Testing O at index 4 (fifth letter) is efficient, as index 0 and 3 can be covered in later guesses if needed.  
   - **Letter Selection**: Use available consonants (e.g., V, I, G) that are common and untested. Avoid excluded letters and duplicates.  
   - Word pattern: `_ _ R _ O` (to test O at index 4).  

4. **Word Choice**:
   - **Candidate: ""VIRGO""** (a valid English word meaning a zodiac sign or ""virgin"").  
     - Fits pattern: `V (index 0), I (index 1), R (index 2, confirmed ✓), G (index 3), O (index 4)`.  
     - Tests O at position 4 (new).  
     - Introduces new letters V, I, G (all high-frequency, maximizing information gain).  
     - Avoids excluded letters and duplicates.  
   - **Alternatives considered**:  
     - O at index 0: Options like ""OUIJA"" or ""OAKER"" fail due to excluded letters (A, E) or invalidity.  
     - O at index 3: Words like ""FUROR"" (O at index 3) introduce duplicate R, which is risky without evidence of duplicates; ""BIROS"" or ""LIROT"" are invalid due to excluded letters (S, T).  
     - ""VIRGO"" efficiently balances position testing and new letter coverage.  

5. **Expected Feedback**:  
   - R at index 2 will show as ✓ (already confirmed).  
   - Results for V, I, G, and O will provide new info:  
     - O at index 4: If ✓, position solved; if - , O must be at index 0 or 3.  
     - V, I, G feedback will reveal if any are in the word and their positions.  

6. **Remaining Guesses**: 2 guesses left if needed (after this).  

<guess>VIRGO</guess>",VIRGO,"We have the previous feedback:

Guess 1: CRANE -> Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
- R is in the word but not in position 1 (index 1, 0-based).

Guess 2: SPORT -> Feedback: S(x) P(x) O(-) R(-) T(x)
- O is in the word but not in position 2 (index 2).
- R is in the word but not in position 3 (index 3).

Guess 3: WORDY -> Feedback: W(x) O(-) R(✓) D(x) Y(x)
- R is in the correct position! At position 2 (index 2). So the third letter is R.
- O is in the word but not in position 1 (index 1). 
- W, D, Y are not in the word.

From this, we know:
- The secret word has R as the third letter (position 2, 0-based). So the word is ? ? R ? ?.
- O is in the word, but not at position 1 (which we just tried) and not at position 2 (from Guess 2). So O must be at position 0, 3, or 4.
- Letters not in the word: C, A, N, E, S, P, T, W, D, Y (all marked 'x' in at least one guess).
- R is fixed at position 2.

Now, we need to find a word that fits:
- Third letter is R: __ __ R __ __
- Contains O somewhere, but not at position 1 or 2. So O must be at 0, 3, or 4.
- Exclude the absent letters: C, A, N, E, S, P, T, W, D, Y.

Available letters: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, R, U, V, X, Z. But R is fixed at position 2, and O must appear once (no duplicates indicated, so we assume single for now).

We need to form a word with O at position 0, 3, or 4.

Possible options:

1. O at position 0: O _ R _ _
2. O at position 3: _ _ R O _
3. O at position 4: _ _ R _ O

We need to use the available letters and form valid words.

We also have two more guesses so far (this will be fourth guess).

We want to test possible positions for O and also test more letters.

Since O has three possible positions (0,3,4), we might need to choose a word that tests O at one of these and also tests other common letters.

First, consider O at position 0: O _ R _ _

The second letter must be from available set. Similarly, last two letters.

Words: e.g., ""OGRER"" but duplicate R? And G, E? E is excluded. Duplicate R might be issue, but we don't know.

Possible words:
- ""OUIJA"" has U, I, J, A? A excluded. Invalid.
- ""OLLER"" has L, but E? Excluded. Also, duplicate L? Not good.

Better: ""OILER""? But E excluded.

""OAKER""? A and E issues.

It's hard without vowels. We have U and I available.

Another word: ""ORDER"" has E and R duplicate? E excluded.

""OUMAS""? Not common.

Perhaps O at position 0 is hard with the constraints.

Now, try O at position 3: _ _ R O _

First two letters: available letters, last letter: available.

For example:
- _ _ R O _
Possible: ""MIRRO"" not a word.
- ""FUROR"" has F, U, R, O, R? Duplicate R? And positions: F0, U1, R2, O3, R4. Duplicate R and R at position 2 (fixed) and 4? But R is fixed at 2, so having another R might be possible? We don't know. But ""FUROR"" has A? No, F,U,R,O,R. But duplicate R. And the word ends with R.

But D and Y are out, but R is allowed? Duplicates may be possible but we haven't seen one yet.

But ""FUROR"" is a word? Fury is, but furor? Yes, it's valid.

Letters: F, U, R, O; with duplicate R? In ""FUROR"", it's F-U-R-O-R, so it has R at position 2 and 4. But we know position 2 is R, so if there is another R, it might be at 4.

But we have O at position 3.

However, the word must be checked against excluded letters: F,U,R,O,R. R is allowed, but F,U,O are new. Excluded letters don't include these.

But we also have the constraint that O must not be at position 2 (which it isn't, it's at 3) and R is at 2, correct.

But duplicate R: we don't know if the word has duplicate letters, but it's possible.

Another word without duplicate: ""BIROS""? B,I,R,O,S? S excluded.

""GIRO"" is 4 letters.

""HERO"" is 4.

""KIRO"" not common.

""MURO"" not common.

""VIRO"" not common.

Perhaps ""FUROR"" is an option.

Now, O at position 4: _ _ R _ O

First two and the fourth letter.

E.g., ""BERMO""? E excluded.

""GARBO""? A excluded.

""JIRGA""? A excluded? J,I,R,G,A? A excluded, invalid.

""LIRDO""? Not familiar.

Another: ""TERRO""? E and T excluded.

It's challenging.

Perhaps ""MORRO""? M,O,R,R,O? Duplicate O and R? But R at position 2? M0, O1, R2, R3, O4. O at position 1? But in this guess, if we put O at position 1, we know from Guess 3 that O is not at position 1? In Guess 3, WORDY had O at position 1 and it was wrong position, so O is not at position 1.

So we cannot use O at position 1.

Similarly, O cannot be at position 2.

In ""MORRO"", O is at 1 and 4. But position 1 is not allowed for O, so if we try ""MORRO"", the O at 1 would be wrong, and at 4 might be correct or wrong.

But we shouldn't put O at position 1 because we know it's not there.

So for O at position 4, the word should not have O at 1 or 2.

Similarly, for other positions.

Back to O at position 3: _ _ R O _

We can try to use common letters.

Possible words:
- The first two letters: let's say B and U: ""BURRO""? B,U,R,R,O? Duplicate R and O at 3? B0, U1, R2, R3, O4? For O at position 4? I need O at position 3.

If O is at position 3, the pattern is _ _ R O _

So after R must be O, then another letter.

So ""___RO"" but the last letter is not O, it's O at the fourth position, so the word should end with something after O.

Pattern: positions: 0:?, 1:?, 2:R, 3:O, 4:?

So it must be a letter at position 4.

For example:
- ""FROWN"" has N? Excluded.
- ""BROWN"" has N? Excluded.
- ""CROOK"" has C and K? C excluded, K is available? C excluded? C is in excluded list. And O at 3? B0,R1,O2? We need R at 2, so not.

Better: ""MICRO"" M,I,C,R,O -> C excluded.

""TROOP"" T and P excluded.

Since S,P,T are excluded, avoid.

Another: ""QUERO"" not common.

Maybe ""VEROO"" not.

Perhaps ""HIRO"" is 4 letters.

""FIORD""? But that's Fjord spelling variation? And D is excluded? No, D is in excluded? D: in Guess 3, D was marked x, so D not in word.

D is excluded.

In Guess 3, WORDY had D at position 3 and it was x, so D not present.

Similarly, Y not, W not.

So excluded: C,A,N,E,S,P,T,W,D,Y

Available: B,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,Q,R,U,V,X,Z

And O must be placed.

Now, O at position 3: word pattern: _ _ R O ?

Position 4: needs a letter, say L: ""BAROL""? Not a word.

With U: ""CURIO""? C is excluded.

""BURIO"" not valid.

""FERIO"" not common.

""HERO"" too short.

""ZERO"" Z,E,R,O -> E excluded.

J: ""JERBO"" J,E,R,B,O -> E excluded.

L: ""LORRO""? Not common.

M: ""MAROO"" not.

Perhaps ""GROOF"" not valid.

This is tough.

Maybe O at position 0 is easier.

O at 0: O _ R _ _

Position 1: must be a consonant, say G: ""OGRES""? E excluded.

""OGHAM"" G,H,A,M -> A excluded.

""OGIVE"" E? Excluded.

""OGRIS"" not common.

""OLEIC"" E? Excluded.

""OLIOS"" duplicate O? And O at 0 and 4? But we don't know.

""OPING"" O at 0, P is excluded.

""OUBIT"" U,B,I,T -> T excluded.

""OUPHE"" E and U? E excluded.

Not working.

O at position 4: _ _ R _ O

For example:
- ""BURDO"" not valid.
- ""FERMO"" E excluded.
- ""GIRZO"" not.
- ""HORMO"" H,O,R,M,O? Duplicate O? And O at 1 not allowed.
- ""JARUL"" not.

Perhaps ""VIRGO"" V,I,R,G,O. Positions: V0, I1, R2, G3, O4.

Letters: V,I,G,O. All available? Excluded? V,I,G not excluded.

And O at position 4.

Also, does not have O at position 1 or 2? Yes, position 1 is I, and O at 4.

So ""VIRGO"" is a word (astrology sign).

Check against constraints:
- R at position 2: fixed and correct.
- O at position 4: we want to test O at a new position.
- Letters: V,I,G,O,R. V,I,G new.

Also, avoids excluded letters.

So it should work.

We can test if O is at position 4.

Similarly, we want to test other possibilities? But we have only one guess.

Another option: O at position 3? But we couldn't find a good word for that.

But ""FUROR"" came to mind: F,U,R,O,R? But duplicate R? And O at position 3? In ""FUROR"": F0, U1, R2, O3, R4. Yes, O at position 3.

But duplicate R at position 4? R is already at position 2, so if the word has two R's, that might be possible.

But we don't know.

""FUROR"" has R twice, but it's allowed if the secret word has multiple R's.

But so far, we have no evidence of duplicates.

""VIRGO"" only has one R.

Both are valid.

Now, which one to choose?

""VIRGO"": tests O at position 4.
""FUROR"": tests O at position 3 and possible duplicate R.

We also have to consider the letters.

In ""VIRGO"", we test V, I, G.

In ""FUROR"", we test F, U, and see if R appears again.

Both are good.

But note, in ""FUROR"", position 4 is R, which is not the fixed R; it's an additional R. And we know R is not at position 1 or 3, but position 4 hasn't been tested for R? We haven't tried R at position 4.

But we know R is in the word at position 2, so if there is a duplicate, it could be elsewhere.

But we don't have information on duplicates.

To test specifically for O's position, it's better to try ""VIRGO"" to test O at position 4 without introducing a duplicate.

Similarly, we can test O at position 3 later if needed.

Since we have limited guesses, ""VIRGO"" might be safer.

Another word for O at position 3: ""GIROS"" but S excluded.

""BIROS"" same issue.

""LIROT"" T excluded? And L,I,R,O,T. T excluded.

 Not good.

""MUROW"" W excluded.

So ""FUROR"" is one option, but it has duplicate R.

Alternatively, ""VIRGO"" is duplicate-free.

We can choose ""VIRGO"".

Also, we haven't tested V, I, G, which are common.

So I think ""VIRGO"" is a good guess.

Therefore, fourth guess: VIRGO

Position breakdown: 
- 0: V
- 1: I
- 2: R (fixed and known to be correct, so will show as ✓)
- 3: G
- 4: O

We can predict that R will be ✓, and feedback for V, I, G, O will depend.

We hope that if O is at 4, it shows correct, or else wrong position or not.

So let's go with that.### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Current Constraints from Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
     - R is in the word but not in position 1 (0-based index: index 1).  
     - C, A, N, E are not in the word.  
   
   - **Guess 2: SPORT** → Feedback: S(x), P(x), O(-), R(-), T(x)  
     - O is in the word but not in position 2 (index 2).  
     - R is in the word but not in position 3 (index 3).  
     - S, P, T are not in the word.  
   
   - **Guess 3: WORDY** → Feedback: W(x), O(-), R(✓), D(x), Y(x)  
     - R is correct at position 2 (index 2, 0-based); the third letter is **R**. Word pattern: `_ _ R _ _ ?`.  
     - O is in the word but not in position 1 (index 1).  
     - W, D, Y are not in the word.  

2. **Key Inferences**:
   - **R Position**: Fixed at index 2 (third letter).  
     - Confirmed positions: R cannot be at index 1 (from Guess 1) or index 3 (from Guess 2), so it must be at index 2 (as now confirmed).  
   - **O Position**: Must be in the word, but not at index 1 (from WORDY feedback) or index 2 (from SPORT feedback). Remaining possible positions: index 0 (first letter), index 3 (fourth letter), or index 4 (fifth letter).  
   - **Excluded Letters**: C, A, N, E, S, P, T, W, D, Y (all marked ""x"" at least once).  
   - **Available Letters**: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, R, U, V, X, Z. R is fixed at index 2, so it cannot appear elsewhere unless duplicated (no evidence of duplicates yet). O must appear once at an untested position (0, 3, or 4).  

3. **Strategy for Guess 4**:
   - **Prioritize testing O positions**: Since O has only three possible untested positions (0, 3, 4), choose a word that tests one of these while introducing new common letters to gather more information.  
   - **Position Focus**: Testing O at index 4 (fifth letter) is efficient, as index 0 and 3 can be covered in later guesses if needed.  
   - **Letter Selection**: Use available consonants (e.g., V, I, G) that are common and untested. Avoid excluded letters and duplicates.  
   - Word pattern: `_ _ R _ O` (to test O at index 4).  

4. **Word Choice**:
   - **Candidate: ""VIRGO""** (a valid English word meaning a zodiac sign or ""virgin"").  
     - Fits pattern: `V (index 0), I (index 1), R (index 2, confirmed ✓), G (index 3), O (index 4)`.  
     - Tests O at position 4 (new).  
     - Introduces new letters V, I, G (all high-frequency, maximizing information gain).  
     - Avoids excluded letters and duplicates.  
   - **Alternatives considered**:  
     - O at index 0: Options like ""OUIJA"" or ""OAKER"" fail due to excluded letters (A, E) or invalidity.  
     - O at index 3: Words like ""FUROR"" (O at index 3) introduce duplicate R, which is risky without evidence of duplicates; ""BIROS"" or ""LIROT"" are invalid due to excluded letters (S, T).  
     - ""VIRGO"" efficiently balances position testing and new letter coverage.  

5. **Expected Feedback**:  
   - R at index 2 will show as ✓ (already confirmed).  
   - Results for V, I, G, and O will provide new info:  
     - O at index 4: If ✓, position solved; if - , O must be at index 0 or 3.  
     - V, I, G feedback will reveal if any are in the word and their positions.  

6. **Remaining Guesses**: 2 guesses left if needed (after this).",Guess 4: VIRGO -> FEEDBACK: V(x) I(x) R(✓) G(x) O(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,5,juror,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a guess that maximizes the information gained.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid duplicates to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", etc. Let me choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.
 After we get the feedback, we can use it to narrow down the possibilities.<thinking>
As this is my first guess, I don't have any prior feedback to work with. The optimal approach is to choose a starting word that maximizes information gain by including:
- Common English letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words (E, A, R, S, T, etc.)
- A mix of vowels and consonants to cover more possibilities
- No repeating letters to check more distinct characters

Considering these principles, ""CRANE"" is an excellent first guess because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, E) and 2 common consonants (C, R, N)
2. All letters are distinct, testing 5 different characters
3. Frequently used as an opener in word games due to its balanced letter distribution

After submitting ""CRANE"", I'll analyze the feedback pattern (✓,-,x) to identify matching letters and positions, which will guide my next guess.
</thinking>

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"": 
C: x (not in the word)
R: - (in the word but wrong position)
A: x (not in the word)
N: x (not in the word)
E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since in CRANE, R is at position 2, and it's marked as wrong position).
- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter R, but not in the second position. Also, it does not contain C, A, N, E.

We have 6 tries and this was the first guess. Now we need to make a second guess.

We should choose a word that:
- Includes R (since we know it's in the word) and places it in a different position than the second (because in the first guess it was in the second and was wrong).
- Avoids the letters C, A, N, E (since they are not in the word).
- Uses other common letters to maximize the chance of getting more information.

Possible positions for R: since it's not in position 2, it could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

We also know the word is 5 letters and must be a valid English word.

Let's think of words that have R in one of the positions 1, 3, 4, 5 and avoid C, A, N, E.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, etc.

A good second guess might be a word that has R and several of these new letters.

For example, let's consider words starting with S or T, as they are common.

We can try to put R in the first position? But note: we don't know if R is in the first position or not. We only know it's not in the second.

But we can try a word that has R in a different position.

Let me list some words that have R and avoid C, A, N, E.

Example: ""ROUST"" - but that has U and O, which we haven't tested. But let's see.

Alternatively, ""TRIES"" - but that has E, which we know is not in the word. So we must avoid E.

We must avoid E because it was marked as not present.

So, we need a word without C, A, N, E.

Let me think of words with R and without these letters.

Common words: 
- ""SPORT"": has S, P, O, R, T. R is at position 4. But we don't know if O is in the word or not.
- ""STORM"": has S, T, O, R, M. R is at position 4. Also, we avoid C, A, N, E.

But note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates yet.

Another idea: ""DRUID"" - but D is a new letter, but we have to avoid A and E? ""DRUID"" has D, R, U, I, D? Wait, duplicate D? Also, it has U and I which are new.

But we know R is in the word, so we can try to use it.

But perhaps we can choose a word that has R and many common consonants and vowels that we haven't tried.

Vowels we haven't tried: O, I, U (and sometimes Y, but let's avoid Y for now).

We know the word must have at least one R, and we have 5 positions to fill without C, A, N, E.

Let me try to come up with a word that has R and uses common letters.

One classic word is ""ROUND"", but that has O, U, N, D. But N is not allowed (we know N is not in the word). So we cannot use N.

So avoid N.

Another: ""PROUD"" - has P, R, O, U, D. R is at position 2? But wait, in our first guess, R was at position 2 and it was marked as wrong position. So if we put R at position 2 again, it would still be wrong? But we don't know if the secret word has R at position 2 or not? Actually, the feedback for the first guess said R is in the word but not at position 2. So if we put R at position 2 again, it would still be marked as wrong position (if the correct position is not 2) or correct if it is? But we know it's not at position 2? Actually, the feedback only tells us that in the first guess, R was not at the correct position. But it might be that the secret word has R at position 2? No, because if it were at position 2, it would have been marked as correct (✓). But it was marked as wrong position (-), meaning R is in the word but not at position 2. Therefore, position 2 is definitely not the correct position for R.

So if we put R at position 2 again, it would still be marked as wrong position (unless the secret word has two R's and one of them is at position 2? But we don't know about duplicates). However, to avoid confusion, it might be better to put R in a different position to test a new spot.

But we don't have to avoid position 2 for R? Actually, we know that position 2 is not correct for R, so if we put R at position 2 again, we will get the same feedback (wrong position) and we don't gain new information about the position. So it's better to try R in a new position.

Therefore, for the second guess, we should put R in one of the positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Let me try to form a word without C, A, N, E and with R in a new position.

For example, position 1: R at the start.

Words: ""ROAST"" - but has A, which is not allowed. Avoid A.

""ROOST"" - has O, O, S, T. But O is repeated? And we don't know about O. Also, it has O and S, T.

But we avoid A, but O is new.

""ROOTS"" - similar.

But we can use ""ROILS"" or ""ROUPS"" but not common.

Another: ""RISKY"" - has R at position 1, I, S, K, Y. Avoids C, A, N, E. But Y is less common.

Alternatively, position 3: for example, ""BORED"" - but has E, which is not allowed.

""FORTS"" - has F, O, R, T, S. R is at position 3. Avoids C, A, N, E.

""PORTS"" - similar.

Position 4: ""SPORT"", as I thought earlier.

Position 5: ""LATER"" - but has A and E, not allowed.

""RUMOR"" - has U, M, O, R. R at the end? But also R at the beginning? Duplicate R.

We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but we can avoid for now.

After considering, I think ""SPORT"" is a good candidate:
- S, P, O, R, T
- R is at position 4 (a new position, not 2)
- Avoids C, A, N, E
- Uses common letters: S, P, O, T

Another candidate: ""STORM"" - similar, with R at position 4 and M instead of P.

But we might get more information with ""SPORT"" or ""STORM"".

Alternatively, ""TRIPS"" - has T, R, I, P, S. R at position 2? But we don't want to put R at position 2 again because we know it's not correct and we won't get new position info.

In ""TRIPS"", R is at position 2. We know position 2 is not correct for R, so we would get the same feedback for R (wrong position) and we don't learn a new position. So it's better to avoid position 2 for R in this guess.

Therefore, let's avoid words with R at position 2.

So, ""SPORT"" has R at position 4.

Similarly, ""DRIPS"" has R at position 3? D, R, I, P, S. But we don't know about D.

But ""DRIPS"" has R at position 2? No: D is position 1, R is position 2. So that's position 2 again. We don't want that.

How about ""GRIPS""? G is new, but R is at position 2 again.

We want R not at position 2.

So let's look for words with R at 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Another word: ""PURSE"" - but has E, not allowed.

""BIRDS"" - has B, I, R, D, S. R is at position 3. Avoids C, A, N, E.

But B is new.

""FIRST"" - F, I, R, S, T. R at position 3. Avoids C, A, N, E.

Similarly, ""THIRD"" - T, H, I, R, D. R at position 4.

But we have to choose one.

I think ""FIRST"" is a good choice because it has common letters: F, I, S, T and R at position 3.

But F is not the most common, but it's okay.

Alternatively, ""SPORT"" is also good.

To maximize vowel information, we can include a vowel we haven't tried. We haven't tried O, I, U.

In ""SPORT"", we have O. In ""FIRST"", we have I.

Both are good.

I'll go with ""SPORT"" because it has O, which is a common vowel, and we get to test S, P, O, T as well.

So, second guess: ""SPORT""

We hope to get feedback on these letters.

If we get a correct position for R, that would be great. But if not, we'll know more.

So, let's choose ""SPORT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, A, N, E are not in the secret word (marked as ""x"").
- R is in the word but not in the second position (marked as ""-"").

For the second guess, I need to:
- Include R (since it's in the secret word) but avoid placing it in the second position again to test a new location.
- Exclude C, A, N, E entirely.
- Use other common letters to maximize information gain (e.g., S, T, O, P).

I chose ""SPORT"" because:
- It places R in the fourth position (a new location to test).
- It avoids C, A, N, E and introduces new common letters: S, P, O, T.
- This combination helps test for vowels (O) and frequent consonants, providing broad coverage.

<guess>SPORT</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SPORT -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(-) R(-) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two guesses and their feedback:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: x (not in word)
- R: - (in word, wrong position)
- A: x (not in word)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: x (not in word)

From this, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter R, but not in the second position (index 1, if we index from 0).
- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: SPORT
- S: x (not in word)
- P: x (not in word)
- O: - (in word, wrong position)
- R: - (in word, wrong position)
- T: x (not in word)

From this, we know:
- The secret word contains O and R, but not in the positions they were guessed (O was in position 2, R was in position 3).
- The letters S, P, T are not in the word.

Combining the information:
- Letters not in the word: C, A, N, E, S, P, T
- Letters in the word: R and O (and we know they are not in positions 1 and 3 for R? Let's clarify positions).

Position indices (0-indexed for clarity):
- CRANE: positions 0:C, 1:R, 2:A, 3:N, 4:E
- SPORT: positions 0:S, 1:P, 2:O, 3:R, 4:T

From CRANE: R is in the word but not at position 1.
From SPORT: R is in the word but not at position 3, and O is in the word but not at position 2.

So R is in the word, but not at index 1 or 3. Therefore, R must be at one of the positions: 0, 2, or 4? But wait, we have 5 positions: 0,1,2,3,4.

But note: in CRANE, R was at position 1 (which is the second letter) and we know it's not there. In SPORT, R was at position 3 (the fourth letter) and it's not there. So R cannot be at position 1 or 3. Therefore, R must be at position 0, 2, or 4.

Similarly, O is in the word but not at position 2 (from SPORT). So O must be at position 0, 1, 3, or 4? But we have to consider the constraints.

Also, we know the following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, E, S, P, T.

So the secret word must contain R and O, and three other letters that are not in the excluded set.

We have 6 tries, and we are on the third guess.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Includes R and O (both must appear, but not at the positions we've already tried for them)
- Excludes C, A, N, E, S, P, T
- Tries to place R in one of the positions 0, 2, or 4 (since it can't be at 1 or 3)
- Tries to place O in a position that is not 2 (so 0,1,3,4) but note that if we place O at a position, we have to avoid the positions we know are wrong for R? They are independent.

But also, we want to test new letters to get more information.

What letters are left? We have the alphabet minus the excluded ones.

Excluded: C, A, N, E, S, P, T

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: O and R are already known to be in the word, so we need to include them.

We also want to use common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.

Common letters: among the available, we have B, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, U, etc.

We need to form a word that has R and O, and three other letters from the available set.

Moreover, we have constraints on the positions for R and O.

Let me think of words that have R and O, without the excluded letters.

For example, words like:
- FLOUR: but has F, L, O, U, R. But we have to check positions. Also, we don't know about F, L, U.
- BROIL: B, R, O, I, L. This might work.

But we need to assign positions.

We know R cannot be at position 1 or 3. So in the word we guess, we should avoid putting R at 1 or 3.

Similarly, O cannot be at position 2.

So for the next guess, we can try to put R at position 0 (the first letter) and O at position 4 (the last), for example, to test new positions.

But we have to form a valid word.

Let me list possible words:

Option 1: R at position 0, O at position 1? But position 1: we know from CRANE that R was at position 1 and it was wrong, but that doesn't say anything about O. However, we have to avoid putting R at 1, but O can be at 1.

But we don't have a constraint that O cannot be at 1. Only that it cannot be at 2.

So possible:

- R at 0, O at 1: e.g., ""ROBOT"" but has B and T? T is excluded. So not.

""ROBOT"" has T, which is excluded.

""ROOMY"" has O repeated and Y, but we don't know about Y. Also, O repeated? We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but we can avoid for now.

""ROWDY"": R, O, W, D, Y. Avoids excluded letters? W, D, Y are not excluded. So ""ROWDY"" is a candidate.

Positions: R at 0, O at 1, W at 2, D at 3, Y at 4.

But we have to check the constraints for R and O:
- R is at 0: which is allowed (not 1 or 3).
- O is at 1: which is allowed (only constraint is not at 2).

So that's okay.

But we are testing O at position 1 and R at position 0.

Another option: put R at position 2 and O at position 4.

For example, ""BROOD"" has O repeated and D, but B is allowed? ""BROOD"": B, R, O, O, D. But duplicate O? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, O is at position 2? But we know O cannot be at position 2 (from SPORT feedback). So if we put O at position 2, it would be wrong, but we already know that. So it's a waste of a position. We should avoid putting O at position 2.

Similarly, we should avoid putting R at positions 1 and 3.

So in our next guess, we should avoid:
- R at positions 1 and 3
- O at position 2

Now, back to ""ROWDY"": it uses R at 0, O at 1, and new letters W, D, Y.

But we don't know if W, D, Y are in the word. It's a good way to test them.

Another word: ""ROGUE"" but E is excluded.

""ROBIN"": R, O, B, I, N. But N is excluded (from CRANE: N is not in the word). So invalid.

""ROOMY"": O repeated and we don't know about duplicates. Also, Y is at the end.

But let's avoid duplicates for now.

""ROWDY"" seems acceptable.

Another word: ""FROWN"": F, R, O, W, N. But N is excluded.

""GROWL"": G, R, O, W, L. This avoids excluded letters. Positions: R at 1? Position 1 is the second letter. But we cannot put R at position 1 because we know it's not the correct position for R. In ""GROWL"", R is at position 1 (if we break down: G0, R1, O2, W3, L4). But we cannot put R at 1 because we know it's not there. Also, O is at position 2, which we know is not correct for O. So we would get - for both, but we already know that. So it doesn't give new position information.

We want to test new positions for R and O.

So we should try to put R at a position we haven't tried: 0, 2, or 4 (since 1 and 3 are tried and wrong).

Similarly for O, we haven't tried positions 0,1,3,4 (only 2 is tried and wrong).

So ideally, we put R at 0, 2, or 4 and O at 0,1,3,4 (but not 2) and in a way that they are in new positions.

Also, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another word: ""DOZER"" but E is excluded and R is at the end? ""DOZER"" has E and R at the end. But E is excluded.

""RUMOR"": has U, M, O, R. But duplicate R? And positions: R at 0 and 4? We don't know about duplicates. Also, O at position 3? That might be okay.

But let's avoid duplicates.

""ROBOT"" is out because of T.

""ROBIN"" is out because of N.

""ROUGE"" has E.

""ROWDY"" is a valid word and uses W, D, Y which are not tested.

Another option: ""ROYAL"" but A is excluded.

""ROUND"" has N and D? N is excluded.

""FROST"" has S and T, excluded.

""CRONY"" has C and N, excluded.

So ""ROWDY"" seems a good candidate.

But let me think of another: ""GROUT"" has T, excluded.

""BROWN"" has N, excluded.

""GROWL"" has R at position 1, which we cannot use.

What about ""MOURN""? Has U, but N is excluded.

""DOUGH"" has D, O, U, G, H. But no R? We must include R because we know R is in the word. So we have to include R.

So the word must contain R and O.

Another word: ""FJORD"" has F, J, O, R, D. Avoids excluded letters. Positions: F0, J1, O2, R3, D4.

But O is at position 2: we know O cannot be at position 2 (from SPORT feedback). So if we use this, O at 2 would be marked as wrong position, which we already know. So it doesn't help.

Similarly, R is at position 3: we know R cannot be at position 3 (from SPORT feedback). So again, we get no new position information for R and O.

We want to avoid that.

So we need a word where:
- R is at 0, 2, or 4 (new positions to test)
- O is at 0,1,3, or 4 (but not 2)

And the word must be valid.

""ROWDY"": R at 0, O at 1, W at 2, D at 3, Y at 4. This satisfies:
- R at 0: new position
- O at 1: new position (we haven't tried O at 1 before)

We haven't tried O at position 1, so it's a good test.

Similarly, we test W, D, Y.

Another possibility: ""ROBED"" but E is excluded.

""RULED"" has E and L, U, D. E excluded.

""RIFLE"" has E and F, L. E excluded.

""RHYME"" has E, H, Y, M. E excluded.

""ROBOT"" excluded.

""ROWDY"" seems one of the few options.

""ROWED"" has E, excluded.

""ROWDY"" is valid.

Another word: ""ROYAL"" has A, excluded.

""ROBES"" has E and S, excluded.

So I think ""ROWDY"" is a good choice.

But let me confirm the letters: R, O, W, D, Y. None of these are excluded (excluded are C,A,N,E,S,P,T).

So yes.

We can also consider ""DOLLY"" but no R.

Must have R.

""WORDY"": W, O, R, D, Y. This is also a word.

Positions: W0, O1, R2, D3, Y4.

Now, check constraints:
- R is at position 2: which is a new position (we haven't tried R at 2 before). We tried R at 1 and 3, so 2 is new.
- O is at position 1: which is new (we only tried O at 2 before, which was wrong).

So ""WORDY"" also satisfies.

Now, between ""ROWDY"" and ""WORDY"", which one to choose?

""ROWDY"": R at 0, O at 1
""WORDY"": W at 0, O at 1, R at 2

Both test O at 1 and R at a new position (0 or 2).

But ""WORDY"" has R at 2, which is the middle, and we haven't tested that. Also, in ""ROWDY"", R is at 0, which is the first letter.

We don't have a strong preference, but note that in ""WORDY"", we are testing W at 0 and D at 3, Y at 4, same as ""ROWDY"" but with different arrangement.

But ""WORDY"" might be less common? But it's a valid word.

Another point: we know that in the secret word, R cannot be at 1 or 3, so position 2 is a possibility. Similarly, position 0 and 4.

I think both are acceptable.

But let's see the commonality. ""ROWDY"" is more common than ""WORDY""? Not sure.

We can choose ""WORDY"" to test R in the middle.

But I recall that in Wordle, common words are better, but both are valid.

To break the tie, note that in ""ROWDY"", we have R at 0 and O at 1, which are adjacent. In ""WORDY"", O and R are adjacent at positions 1 and 2. But that might not matter.

Another word: ""DOZER"" excluded.

""FJORD"" has O at 2, which we cannot use.

I think ""WORDY"" is fine.

But let me check: ""WORDY"" is an adjective meaning using too many words, so it's valid.

Similarly, ""ROWDY"" is also valid.

I'll go with ""WORDY"" because it tests R at position 2, which we haven't tried, and O at position 1.

So guess: ""WORDY""

But let's write it in uppercase: ""WORDY""

Now, to summarize:

We are guessing ""WORDY"" to test:
- R at position 2 (new position)
- O at position 1 (new position)
- And letters W, D, Y which are new.

We hope to get feedback that might confirm positions for R and O or reveal new letters.

If we get a correct for R or O, that would be great.

But even if not, we'll know more about the positions.

So, third guess: WORDYBased on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
  - R is in the word but not in position 1 (second letter).  
  - C, A, N, E are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: SPORT** → Feedback: S(x), P(x), O(-), R(-), T(x)  
  - O is in the word but not in position 2 (third letter).  
  - R is in the word but not in position 3 (fourth letter).  
  - S, P, T are not in the word.  

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed in the word**: R and O must appear, but with position constraints:  
  - R cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (index 1 or 3, 0-indexed).  
  - O cannot be in position 2 (index 2).  
- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, E, S, P, T (cannot appear in the word).  
- **Remaining positions for R**: 0, 2, or 4 (first, third, or fifth letter).  
- **Remaining positions for O**: 0, 1, 3, or 4 (first, second, fourth, or fifth letter).  
- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding the 7 known absent letters).  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test R in a new position (not 1 or 3) and O in a new position (not 2) to gather more positional information.  
- Prioritize positions:  
  - Place R at position 2 (index 2) to test the center, as it hasn't been tried yet.  
  - Place O at position 1 (index 1) to test the second letter position, which is new for O.  
- Include new high-frequency letters (e.g., W, D, Y) to maximize information gain.  
- Avoid excluded letters and duplicate letters (since no duplicates have been indicated yet).  

The word **""WORDY""** fits these criteria:  
- W (position 0), O (position 1), R (position 2), D (position 3), Y (position 4).  
- Tests R at position 2 (new) and O at position 1 (new).  
- Introduces W, D, and Y as new letters.  
- Valid English word (adjective, meaning ""using too many words"").  

This guess will help narrow down the positions of R and O and reveal if any of W, D, or Y are in the word.

<guess>WORDY</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SPORT -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(-) R(-) T(x)
Guess 3: WORDY -> FEEDBACK: W(x) O(-) R(✓) D(x) Y(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the previous feedback:

Guess 1: CRANE -> Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
- R is in the word but not in position 1 (index 1, 0-based).

Guess 2: SPORT -> Feedback: S(x) P(x) O(-) R(-) T(x)
- O is in the word but not in position 2 (index 2).
- R is in the word but not in position 3 (index 3).

Guess 3: WORDY -> Feedback: W(x) O(-) R(✓) D(x) Y(x)
- R is in the correct position! At position 2 (index 2). So the third letter is R.
- O is in the word but not in position 1 (index 1). 
- W, D, Y are not in the word.

From this, we know:
- The secret word has R as the third letter (position 2, 0-based). So the word is ? ? R ? ?.
- O is in the word, but not at position 1 (which we just tried) and not at position 2 (from Guess 2). So O must be at position 0, 3, or 4.
- Letters not in the word: C, A, N, E, S, P, T, W, D, Y (all marked 'x' in at least one guess).
- R is fixed at position 2.

Now, we need to find a word that fits:
- Third letter is R: __ __ R __ __
- Contains O somewhere, but not at position 1 or 2. So O must be at 0, 3, or 4.
- Exclude the absent letters: C, A, N, E, S, P, T, W, D, Y.

Available letters: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, R, U, V, X, Z. But R is fixed at position 2, and O must appear once (no duplicates indicated, so we assume single for now).

We need to form a word with O at position 0, 3, or 4.

Possible options:

1. O at position 0: O _ R _ _
2. O at position 3: _ _ R O _
3. O at position 4: _ _ R _ O

We need to use the available letters and form valid words.

We also have two more guesses so far (this will be fourth guess).

We want to test possible positions for O and also test more letters.

Since O has three possible positions (0,3,4), we might need to choose a word that tests O at one of these and also tests other common letters.

First, consider O at position 0: O _ R _ _

The second letter must be from available set. Similarly, last two letters.

Words: e.g., ""OGRER"" but duplicate R? And G, E? E is excluded. Duplicate R might be issue, but we don't know.

Possible words:
- ""OUIJA"" has U, I, J, A? A excluded. Invalid.
- ""OLLER"" has L, but E? Excluded. Also, duplicate L? Not good.

Better: ""OILER""? But E excluded.

""OAKER""? A and E issues.

It's hard without vowels. We have U and I available.

Another word: ""ORDER"" has E and R duplicate? E excluded.

""OUMAS""? Not common.

Perhaps O at position 0 is hard with the constraints.

Now, try O at position 3: _ _ R O _

First two letters: available letters, last letter: available.

For example:
- _ _ R O _
Possible: ""MIRRO"" not a word.
- ""FUROR"" has F, U, R, O, R? Duplicate R? And positions: F0, U1, R2, O3, R4. Duplicate R and R at position 2 (fixed) and 4? But R is fixed at 2, so having another R might be possible? We don't know. But ""FUROR"" has A? No, F,U,R,O,R. But duplicate R. And the word ends with R.

But D and Y are out, but R is allowed? Duplicates may be possible but we haven't seen one yet.

But ""FUROR"" is a word? Fury is, but furor? Yes, it's valid.

Letters: F, U, R, O; with duplicate R? In ""FUROR"", it's F-U-R-O-R, so it has R at position 2 and 4. But we know position 2 is R, so if there is another R, it might be at 4.

But we have O at position 3.

However, the word must be checked against excluded letters: F,U,R,O,R. R is allowed, but F,U,O are new. Excluded letters don't include these.

But we also have the constraint that O must not be at position 2 (which it isn't, it's at 3) and R is at 2, correct.

But duplicate R: we don't know if the word has duplicate letters, but it's possible.

Another word without duplicate: ""BIROS""? B,I,R,O,S? S excluded.

""GIRO"" is 4 letters.

""HERO"" is 4.

""KIRO"" not common.

""MURO"" not common.

""VIRO"" not common.

Perhaps ""FUROR"" is an option.

Now, O at position 4: _ _ R _ O

First two and the fourth letter.

E.g., ""BERMO""? E excluded.

""GARBO""? A excluded.

""JIRGA""? A excluded? J,I,R,G,A? A excluded, invalid.

""LIRDO""? Not familiar.

Another: ""TERRO""? E and T excluded.

It's challenging.

Perhaps ""MORRO""? M,O,R,R,O? Duplicate O and R? But R at position 2? M0, O1, R2, R3, O4. O at position 1? But in this guess, if we put O at position 1, we know from Guess 3 that O is not at position 1? In Guess 3, WORDY had O at position 1 and it was wrong position, so O is not at position 1.

So we cannot use O at position 1.

Similarly, O cannot be at position 2.

In ""MORRO"", O is at 1 and 4. But position 1 is not allowed for O, so if we try ""MORRO"", the O at 1 would be wrong, and at 4 might be correct or wrong.

But we shouldn't put O at position 1 because we know it's not there.

So for O at position 4, the word should not have O at 1 or 2.

Similarly, for other positions.

Back to O at position 3: _ _ R O _

We can try to use common letters.

Possible words:
- The first two letters: let's say B and U: ""BURRO""? B,U,R,R,O? Duplicate R and O at 3? B0, U1, R2, R3, O4? For O at position 4? I need O at position 3.

If O is at position 3, the pattern is _ _ R O _

So after R must be O, then another letter.

So ""___RO"" but the last letter is not O, it's O at the fourth position, so the word should end with something after O.

Pattern: positions: 0:?, 1:?, 2:R, 3:O, 4:?

So it must be a letter at position 4.

For example:
- ""FROWN"" has N? Excluded.
- ""BROWN"" has N? Excluded.
- ""CROOK"" has C and K? C excluded, K is available? C excluded? C is in excluded list. And O at 3? B0,R1,O2? We need R at 2, so not.

Better: ""MICRO"" M,I,C,R,O -> C excluded.

""TROOP"" T and P excluded.

Since S,P,T are excluded, avoid.

Another: ""QUERO"" not common.

Maybe ""VEROO"" not.

Perhaps ""HIRO"" is 4 letters.

""FIORD""? But that's Fjord spelling variation? And D is excluded? No, D is in excluded? D: in Guess 3, D was marked x, so D not in word.

D is excluded.

In Guess 3, WORDY had D at position 3 and it was x, so D not present.

Similarly, Y not, W not.

So excluded: C,A,N,E,S,P,T,W,D,Y

Available: B,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,Q,R,U,V,X,Z

And O must be placed.

Now, O at position 3: word pattern: _ _ R O ?

Position 4: needs a letter, say L: ""BAROL""? Not a word.

With U: ""CURIO""? C is excluded.

""BURIO"" not valid.

""FERIO"" not common.

""HERO"" too short.

""ZERO"" Z,E,R,O -> E excluded.

J: ""JERBO"" J,E,R,B,O -> E excluded.

L: ""LORRO""? Not common.

M: ""MAROO"" not.

Perhaps ""GROOF"" not valid.

This is tough.

Maybe O at position 0 is easier.

O at 0: O _ R _ _

Position 1: must be a consonant, say G: ""OGRES""? E excluded.

""OGHAM"" G,H,A,M -> A excluded.

""OGIVE"" E? Excluded.

""OGRIS"" not common.

""OLEIC"" E? Excluded.

""OLIOS"" duplicate O? And O at 0 and 4? But we don't know.

""OPING"" O at 0, P is excluded.

""OUBIT"" U,B,I,T -> T excluded.

""OUPHE"" E and U? E excluded.

Not working.

O at position 4: _ _ R _ O

For example:
- ""BURDO"" not valid.
- ""FERMO"" E excluded.
- ""GIRZO"" not.
- ""HORMO"" H,O,R,M,O? Duplicate O? And O at 1 not allowed.
- ""JARUL"" not.

Perhaps ""VIRGO"" V,I,R,G,O. Positions: V0, I1, R2, G3, O4.

Letters: V,I,G,O. All available? Excluded? V,I,G not excluded.

And O at position 4.

Also, does not have O at position 1 or 2? Yes, position 1 is I, and O at 4.

So ""VIRGO"" is a word (astrology sign).

Check against constraints:
- R at position 2: fixed and correct.
- O at position 4: we want to test O at a new position.
- Letters: V,I,G,O,R. V,I,G new.

Also, avoids excluded letters.

So it should work.

We can test if O is at position 4.

Similarly, we want to test other possibilities? But we have only one guess.

Another option: O at position 3? But we couldn't find a good word for that.

But ""FUROR"" came to mind: F,U,R,O,R? But duplicate R? And O at position 3? In ""FUROR"": F0, U1, R2, O3, R4. Yes, O at position 3.

But duplicate R at position 4? R is already at position 2, so if the word has two R's, that might be possible.

But we don't know.

""FUROR"" has R twice, but it's allowed if the secret word has multiple R's.

But so far, we have no evidence of duplicates.

""VIRGO"" only has one R.

Both are valid.

Now, which one to choose?

""VIRGO"": tests O at position 4.
""FUROR"": tests O at position 3 and possible duplicate R.

We also have to consider the letters.

In ""VIRGO"", we test V, I, G.

In ""FUROR"", we test F, U, and see if R appears again.

Both are good.

But note, in ""FUROR"", position 4 is R, which is not the fixed R; it's an additional R. And we know R is not at position 1 or 3, but position 4 hasn't been tested for R? We haven't tried R at position 4.

But we know R is in the word at position 2, so if there is a duplicate, it could be elsewhere.

But we don't have information on duplicates.

To test specifically for O's position, it's better to try ""VIRGO"" to test O at position 4 without introducing a duplicate.

Similarly, we can test O at position 3 later if needed.

Since we have limited guesses, ""VIRGO"" might be safer.

Another word for O at position 3: ""GIROS"" but S excluded.

""BIROS"" same issue.

""LIROT"" T excluded? And L,I,R,O,T. T excluded.

 Not good.

""MUROW"" W excluded.

So ""FUROR"" is one option, but it has duplicate R.

Alternatively, ""VIRGO"" is duplicate-free.

We can choose ""VIRGO"".

Also, we haven't tested V, I, G, which are common.

So I think ""VIRGO"" is a good guess.

Therefore, fourth guess: VIRGO

Position breakdown: 
- 0: V
- 1: I
- 2: R (fixed and known to be correct, so will show as ✓)
- 3: G
- 4: O

We can predict that R will be ✓, and feedback for V, I, G, O will depend.

We hope that if O is at 4, it shows correct, or else wrong position or not.

So let's go with that.### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Current Constraints from Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
     - R is in the word but not in position 1 (0-based index: index 1).  
     - C, A, N, E are not in the word.  
   
   - **Guess 2: SPORT** → Feedback: S(x), P(x), O(-), R(-), T(x)  
     - O is in the word but not in position 2 (index 2).  
     - R is in the word but not in position 3 (index 3).  
     - S, P, T are not in the word.  
   
   - **Guess 3: WORDY** → Feedback: W(x), O(-), R(✓), D(x), Y(x)  
     - R is correct at position 2 (index 2, 0-based); the third letter is **R**. Word pattern: `_ _ R _ _ ?`.  
     - O is in the word but not in position 1 (index 1).  
     - W, D, Y are not in the word.  

2. **Key Inferences**:
   - **R Position**: Fixed at index 2 (third letter).  
     - Confirmed positions: R cannot be at index 1 (from Guess 1) or index 3 (from Guess 2), so it must be at index 2 (as now confirmed).  
   - **O Position**: Must be in the word, but not at index 1 (from WORDY feedback) or index 2 (from SPORT feedback). Remaining possible positions: index 0 (first letter), index 3 (fourth letter), or index 4 (fifth letter).  
   - **Excluded Letters**: C, A, N, E, S, P, T, W, D, Y (all marked ""x"" at least once).  
   - **Available Letters**: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, R, U, V, X, Z. R is fixed at index 2, so it cannot appear elsewhere unless duplicated (no evidence of duplicates yet). O must appear once at an untested position (0, 3, or 4).  

3. **Strategy for Guess 4**:
   - **Prioritize testing O positions**: Since O has only three possible untested positions (0, 3, 4), choose a word that tests one of these while introducing new common letters to gather more information.  
   - **Position Focus**: Testing O at index 4 (fifth letter) is efficient, as index 0 and 3 can be covered in later guesses if needed.  
   - **Letter Selection**: Use available consonants (e.g., V, I, G) that are common and untested. Avoid excluded letters and duplicates.  
   - Word pattern: `_ _ R _ O` (to test O at index 4).  

4. **Word Choice**:
   - **Candidate: ""VIRGO""** (a valid English word meaning a zodiac sign or ""virgin"").  
     - Fits pattern: `V (index 0), I (index 1), R (index 2, confirmed ✓), G (index 3), O (index 4)`.  
     - Tests O at position 4 (new).  
     - Introduces new letters V, I, G (all high-frequency, maximizing information gain).  
     - Avoids excluded letters and duplicates.  
   - **Alternatives considered**:  
     - O at index 0: Options like ""OUIJA"" or ""OAKER"" fail due to excluded letters (A, E) or invalidity.  
     - O at index 3: Words like ""FUROR"" (O at index 3) introduce duplicate R, which is risky without evidence of duplicates; ""BIROS"" or ""LIROT"" are invalid due to excluded letters (S, T).  
     - ""VIRGO"" efficiently balances position testing and new letter coverage.  

5. **Expected Feedback**:  
   - R at index 2 will show as ✓ (already confirmed).  
   - Results for V, I, G, and O will provide new info:  
     - O at index 4: If ✓, position solved; if - , O must be at index 0 or 3.  
     - V, I, G feedback will reveal if any are in the word and their positions.  

6. **Remaining Guesses**: 2 guesses left if needed (after this).

Frequently used as an opener in word games due to its balanced letter distribution\n\nAfter submitting ""CRANE"", I\'ll analyze the feedback pattern (✓,-,x) to identify matching letters and positions, which will guide my next guess.\n</thinking>\n\n<guess>CRANE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"": \nC: x (not in the word)\nR: - (in the word but wrong position)\nA: x (not in the word)\nN: x (not in the word)\nE: x (not in the word)\n\nSo, from this feedback, we know:\n- The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since in CRANE, R is at position 2, and it\'s marked as wrong position).\n- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.\n\nTherefore, the secret word contains the letter R, but not in the second position. Also, it does not contain C, A, N, E.\n\nWe have 6 tries and this was the first guess. Now we need to make a second guess.\n\nWe should choose a word that:\n- Includes R (since we know it\'s in the word) and places it in a different position than the second (because in the first guess it was in the second and was wrong).\n- Avoids the letters C, A, N, E (since they are not in the word).\n- Uses other common letters to maximize the chance of getting more information.\n\nPossible positions for R: since it\'s not in position 2, it could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\nWe also know the word is 5 letters and must be a valid English word.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have R in one of the positions 1, 3, 4, 5 and avoid C, A, N, E.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, etc.\n\nA good second guess might be a word that has R and several of these new letters.\n\nFor example, let\'s consider words starting with S or T, as they are common.\n\nWe can try to put R in the first position? But note: we don\'t know if R is in the first position or not. We only know it\'s not in the second.\n\nBut we can try a word that has R in a different position.\n\nLet me list some words that have R and avoid C, A, N, E.\n\nExample: ""ROUST"" - but that has U and O, which we haven\'t tested. But let\'s see.\n\nAlternatively, ""TRIES"" - but that has E, which we know is not in the word. So we must avoid E.\n\nWe must avoid E because it was marked as not present.\n\nSo, we need a word without C, A, N, E.\n\nLet me think of words with R and without these letters.\n\nCommon words: \n- ""SPORT"": has S, P, O, R, T. R is at position 4. But we don\'t know if O is in the word or not.\n- ""STORM"": has S, T, O, R, M. R is at position 4. Also, we avoid C, A, N, E.\n\nBut note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have any indication of duplicates yet.\n\nAnother idea: ""DRUID"" - but D is a new letter, but we have to avoid A and E? ""DRUID"" has D, R, U, I, D? Wait, duplicate D? Also, it has U and I which are new.\n\nBut we know R is in the word, so we can try to use it.\n\nBut perhaps we can choose a word that has R and many common consonants and vowels that we haven\'t tried.\n\nVowels we haven\'t tried: O, I, U (and sometimes Y, but let\'s avoid Y for now).\n\nWe know the word must have at least one R, and we have 5 positions to fill without C, A, N, E.\n\nLet me try to come up with a word that has R and uses common letters.\n\nOne classic word is ""ROUND"", but that has O, U, N, D. But N is not allowed (we know N is not in the word). So we cannot use N.\n\nSo avoid N.\n\nAnother: ""PROUD"" - has P, R, O, U, D. R is at position 2? But wait, in our first guess, R was at position 2 and it was marked as wrong position. So if we put R at position 2 again, it would still be wrong? But we don\'t know if the secret word has R at position 2 or not? Actually, the feedback for the first guess said R is in the word but not at position 2. So if we put R at position 2 again, it would still be marked as wrong position (if the correct position is not 2) or correct if it is? But we know it\'s not at position 2? Actually, the feedback only tells us that in the first guess, R was not at the correct position. But it might be that the secret word has R at position 2? No, because if it were at position 2, it would have been marked as correct (✓). But it was marked as wrong position (-), meaning R is in the word but not at position 2. Therefore, position 2 is definitely not the correct position for R.\n\nSo if we put R at position 2 again, it would still be marked as wrong position (unless the secret word has two R\'s and one of them is at position 2? But we don\'t know about duplicates). However, to avoid confusion, it might be better to put R in a different position to test a new spot.\n\nBut we don\'t have to avoid position 2 for R? Actually, we know that position 2 is not correct for R, so if we put R at position 2 again, we will get the same feedback (wrong position) and we don\'t gain new information about the position. So it\'s better to try R in a new position.\n\nTherefore, for the second guess, we should put R in one of the positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\nLet me try to form a word without C, A, N, E and with R in a new position.\n\nFor example, position 1: R at the start.\n\nWords: ""ROAST"" - but has A, which is not allowed. Avoid A.\n\n""ROOST"" - has O, O, S, T. But O is repeated? And we don\'t know about O. Also, it has O and S, T.\n\nBut we avoid A, but O is new.\n\n""ROOTS"" - similar.\n\nBut we can use ""ROILS"" or ""ROUPS"" but not common.\n\nAnother: ""RISKY"" - has R at position 1, I, S, K, Y. Avoids C, A, N, E. But Y is less common.\n\nAlternatively, position 3: for example, ""BORED"" - but has E, which is not allowed.\n\n""FORTS"" - has F, O, R, T, S. R is at position 3. Avoids C, A, N, E.\n\n""PORTS"" - similar.\n\nPosition 4: ""SPORT"", as I thought earlier.\n\nPosition 5: ""LATER"" - but has A and E, not allowed.\n\n""RUMOR"" - has U, M, O, R. R at the end? But also R at the beginning? Duplicate R.\n\nWe don\'t know if duplicates are allowed, but we can avoid for now.\n\nAfter considering, I think ""SPORT"" is a good candidate:\n- S, P, O, R, T\n- R is at position 4 (a new position, not 2)\n- Avoids C, A, N, E\n- Uses common letters: S, P, O, T\n\nAnother candidate: ""STORM"" - similar, with R at position 4 and M instead of P.\n\nBut we might get more information with ""SPORT"" or ""STORM"".\n\nAlternatively, ""TRIPS"" - has T, R, I, P, S. R at position 2? But we don\'t want to put R at position 2 again because we know it\'s not correct and we won\'t get new position info.\n\nIn ""TRIPS"", R is at position 2. We know position 2 is not correct for R, so we would get the same feedback for R (wrong position) and we don\'t learn a new position. So it\'s better to avoid position 2 for R in this guess.\n\nTherefore, let\'s avoid words with R at position 2.\n\nSo, ""SPORT"" has R at position 4.\n\nSimilarly, ""DRIPS"" has R at position 3? D, R, I, P, S. But we don\'t know about D.\n\nBut ""DRIPS"" has R at position 2? No: D is position 1, R is position 2. So that\'s position 2 again. We don\'t want that.\n\nHow about ""GRIPS""? G is new, but R is at position 2 again.\n\nWe want R not at position 2.\n\nSo let\'s look for words with R at 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\nAnother word: ""PURSE"" - but has E, not allowed.\n\n""BIRDS"" - has B, I, R, D, S. R is at position 3. Avoids C, A, N, E.\n\nBut B is new.\n\n""FIRST"" - F, I, R, S, T. R at position 3. Avoids C, A, N, E.\n\nSimilarly, ""THIRD"" - T, H, I, R, D. R at position 4.\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nI think ""FIRST"" is a good choice because it has common letters: F, I, S, T and R at position 3.\n\nBut F is not the most common, but it\'s okay.\n\nAlternatively, ""SPORT"" is also good.\n\nTo maximize vowel information, we can include a vowel we haven\'t tried. We haven\'t tried O, I, U.\n\nIn ""SPORT"", we have O. In ""FIRST"", we have I.\n\nBoth are good.\n\nI\'ll go with ""SPORT"" because it has O, which is a common vowel, and we get to test S, P, O, T as well.\n\nSo, second guess: ""SPORT""\n\nWe hope to get feedback on these letters.\n\nIf we get a correct position for R, that would be great. But if not, we\'ll know more.\n\nSo, let\'s choose ""SPORT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- C, A, N, E are not in the secret word (marked as ""x"").\n- R is in the word but not in the second position (marked as ""-"").\n\nFor the second guess, I need to:\n- Include R (since it\'s in the secret word) but avoid placing it in the second position again to test a new location.\n- Exclude C, A, N, E entirely.\n- Use other common letters to maximize information gain (e.g., S, T, O, P).\n\nI chose ""SPORT"" because:\n- It places R in the fourth position (a new location to test).\n- It avoids C, A, N, E and introduces new common letters: S, P, O, T.\n- This combination helps test for vowels (O) and frequent consonants, providing broad coverage.\n\n<guess>SPORT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: SPORT -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(-) R(-) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two guesses and their feedback:\n\nGuess 1: CRANE\n- C: x (not in word)\n- R: - (in word, wrong position)\n- A: x (not in word)\n- N: x (not in word)\n- E: x (not in word)\n\nFrom this, we know:\n- The secret word contains the letter R, but not in the second position (index 1, if we index from 0).\n- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the word.\n\nGuess 2: SPORT\n- S: x (not in word)\n- P: x (not in word)\n- O: - (in word, wrong position)\n- R: - (in word, wrong position)\n- T: x (not in word)\n\nFrom this, we know:\n- The secret word contains O and R, but not in the positions they were guessed (O was in position 2, R was in position 3).\n- The letters S, P, T are not in the word.\n\nCombining the information:\n- Letters not in the word: C, A, N, E, S, P, T\n- Letters in the word: R and O (and we know they are not in positions 1 and 3 for R? Let\'s clarify positions).\n\nPosition indices (0-indexed for clarity):\n- CRANE: positions 0:C, 1:R, 2:A, 3:N, 4:E\n- SPORT: positions 0:S, 1:P, 2:O, 3:R, 4:T\n\nFrom CRANE: R is in the word but not at position 1.\nFrom SPORT: R is in the word but not at position 3, and O is in the word but not at position 2.\n\nSo R is in the word, but not at index 1 or 3. Therefore, R must be at one of the positions: 0, 2, or 4? But wait, we have 5 positions: 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nBut note: in CRANE, R was at position 1 (which is the second letter) and we know it\'s not there. In SPORT, R was at position 3 (the fourth letter) and it\'s not there. So R cannot be at position 1 or 3. Therefore, R must be at position 0, 2, or 4.\n\nSimilarly, O is in the word but not at position 2 (from SPORT). So O must be at position 0, 1, 3, or 4? But we have to consider the constraints.\n\nAlso, we know the following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, E, S, P, T.\n\nSo the secret word must contain R and O, and three other letters that are not in the excluded set.\n\nWe have 6 tries, and we are on the third guess.\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that:\n- Includes R and O (both must appear, but not at the positions we\'ve already tried for them)\n- Excludes C, A, N, E, S, P, T\n- Tries to place R in one of the positions 0, 2, or 4 (since it can\'t be at 1 or 3)\n- Tries to place O in a position that is not 2 (so 0,1,3,4) but note that if we place O at a position, we have to avoid the positions we know are wrong for R? They are independent.\n\nBut also, we want to test new letters to get more information.\n\nWhat letters are left? We have the alphabet minus the excluded ones.\n\nExcluded: C, A, N, E, S, P, T\n\nSo available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nBut note: O and R are already known to be in the word, so we need to include them.\n\nWe also want to use common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.\n\nCommon letters: among the available, we have B, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, U, etc.\n\nWe need to form a word that has R and O, and three other letters from the available set.\n\nMoreover, we have constraints on the positions for R and O.\n\nLet me think of words that have R and O, without the excluded letters.\n\nFor example, words like:\n- FLOUR: but has F, L, O, U, R. But we have to check positions. Also, we don\'t know about F, L, U.\n- BROIL: B, R, O, I, L. This might work.\n\nBut we need to assign positions.\n\nWe know R cannot be at position 1 or 3. So in the word we guess, we should avoid putting R at 1 or 3.\n\nSimilarly, O cannot be at position 2.\n\nSo for the next guess, we can try to put R at position 0 (the first letter) and O at position 4 (the last), for example, to test new positions.\n\nBut we have to form a valid word.\n\nLet me list possible words:\n\nOption 1: R at position 0, O at position 1? But position 1: we know from CRANE that R was at position 1 and it was wrong, but that doesn\'t say anything about O. However, we have to avoid putting R at 1, but O can be at 1.\n\nBut we don\'t have a constraint that O cannot be at 1. Only that it cannot be at 2.\n\nSo possible:\n\n- R at 0, O at 1: e.g., ""ROBOT"" but has B and T? T is excluded. So not.\n\n""ROBOT"" has T, which is excluded.\n\n""ROOMY"" has O repeated and Y, but we don\'t know about Y. Also, O repeated? We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed, but we can avoid for now.\n\n""ROWDY"": R, O, W, D, Y. Avoids excluded letters? W, D, Y are not excluded. So ""ROWDY"" is a candidate.\n\nPositions: R at 0, O at 1, W at 2, D at 3, Y at 4.\n\nBut we have to check the constraints for R and O:\n- R is at 0: which is allowed (not 1 or 3).\n- O is at 1: which is allowed (only constraint is not at 2).\n\nSo that\'s okay.\n\nBut we are testing O at position 1 and R at position 0.\n\nAnother option: put R at position 2 and O at position 4.\n\nFor example, ""BROOD"" has O repeated and D, but B is allowed? ""BROOD"": B, R, O, O, D. But duplicate O? And we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, O is at position 2? But we know O cannot be at position 2 (from SPORT feedback). So if we put O at position 2, it would be wrong, but we already know that. So it\'s a waste of a position. We should avoid putting O at position 2.\n\nSimilarly, we should avoid putting R at positions 1 and 3.\n\nSo in our next guess, we should avoid:\n- R at positions 1 and 3\n- O at position 2\n\nNow, back to ""ROWDY"": it uses R at 0, O at 1, and new letters W, D, Y.\n\nBut we don\'t know if W, D, Y are in the word. It\'s a good way to test them.\n\nAnother word: ""ROGUE"" but E is excluded.\n\n""ROBIN"": R, O, B, I, N. But N is excluded (from CRANE: N is not in the word). So invalid.\n\n""ROOMY"": O repeated and we don\'t know about duplicates. Also, Y is at the end.\n\nBut let\'s avoid duplicates for now.\n\n""ROWDY"" seems acceptable.\n\nAnother word: ""FROWN"": F, R, O, W, N. But N is excluded.\n\n""GROWL"": G, R, O, W, L. This avoids excluded letters. Positions: R at 1? Position 1 is the second letter. But we cannot put R at position 1 because we know it\'s not the correct position for R. In ""GROWL"", R is at position 1 (if we break down: G0, R1, O2, W3, L4). But we cannot put R at 1 because we know it\'s not there. Also, O is at position 2, which we know is not correct for O. So we would get - for both, but we already know that. So it doesn\'t give new position information.\n\nWe want to test new positions for R and O.\n\nSo we should try to put R at a position we haven\'t tried: 0, 2, or 4 (since 1 and 3 are tried and wrong).\n\nSimilarly for O, we haven\'t tried positions 0,1,3,4 (only 2 is tried and wrong).\n\nSo ideally, we put R at 0, 2, or 4 and O at 0,1,3,4 (but not 2) and in a way that they are in new positions.\n\nAlso, we want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nAnother word: ""DOZER"" but E is excluded and R is at the end? ""DOZER"" has E and R at the end. But E is excluded.\n\n""RUMOR"": has U, M, O, R. But duplicate R? And positions: R at 0 and 4? We don\'t know about duplicates. Also, O at position 3? That might be okay.\n\nBut let\'s avoid duplicates.\n\n""ROBOT"" is out because of T.\n\n""ROBIN"" is out because of N.\n\n""ROUGE"" has E.\n\n""ROWDY"" is a valid word and uses W, D, Y which are not tested.\n\nAnother option: ""ROYAL"" but A is excluded.\n\n""ROUND"" has N and D? N is excluded.\n\n""FROST"" has S and T, excluded.\n\n""CRONY"" has C and N, excluded.\n\nSo ""ROWDY"" seems a good candidate.\n\nBut let me think of another: ""GROUT"" has T, excluded.\n\n""BROWN"" has N, excluded.\n\n""GROWL"" has R at position 1, which we cannot use.\n\nWhat about ""MOURN""? Has U, but N is excluded.\n\n""DOUGH"" has D, O, U, G, H. But no R? We must include R because we know R is in the word. So we have to include R.\n\nSo the word must contain R and O.\n\nAnother word: ""FJORD"" has F, J, O, R, D. Avoids excluded letters. Positions: F0, J1, O2, R3, D4.\n\nBut O is at position 2: we know O cannot be at position 2 (from SPORT feedback). So if we use this, O at 2 would be marked as wrong position, which we already know. So it doesn\'t help.\n\nSimilarly, R is at position 3: we know R cannot be at position 3 (from SPORT feedback). So again, we get no new position information for R and O.\n\nWe want to avoid that.\n\nSo we need a word where:\n- R is at 0, 2, or 4 (new positions to test)\n- O is at 0,1,3, or 4 (but not 2)\n\nAnd the word must be valid.\n\n""ROWDY"": R at 0, O at 1, W at 2, D at 3, Y at 4. This satisfies:\n- R at 0: new position\n- O at 1: new position (we haven\'t tried O at 1 before)\n\nWe haven\'t tried O at position 1, so it\'s a good test.\n\nSimilarly, we test W, D, Y.\n\nAnother possibility: ""ROBED"" but E is excluded.\n\n""RULED"" has E and L, U, D. E excluded.\n\n""RIFLE"" has E and F, L. E excluded.\n\n""RHYME"" has E, H, Y, M. E excluded.\n\n""ROBOT"" excluded.\n\n""ROWDY"" seems one of the few options.\n\n""ROWED"" has E, excluded.\n\n""ROWDY"" is valid.\n\nAnother word: ""ROYAL"" has A, excluded.\n\n""ROBES"" has E and S, excluded.\n\nSo I think ""ROWDY"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me confirm the letters: R, O, W, D, Y. None of these are excluded (excluded are C,A,N,E,S,P,T).\n\nSo yes.\n\nWe can also consider ""DOLLY"" but no R.\n\nMust have R.\n\n""WORDY"": W, O, R, D, Y. This is also a word.\n\nPositions: W0, O1, R2, D3, Y4.\n\nNow, check constraints:\n- R is at position 2: which is a new position (we haven\'t tried R at 2 before). We tried R at 1 and 3, so 2 is new.\n- O is at position 1: which is new (we only tried O at 2 before, which was wrong).\n\nSo ""WORDY"" also satisfies.\n\nNow, between ""ROWDY"" and ""WORDY"", which one to choose?\n\n""ROWDY"": R at 0, O at 1\n""WORDY"": W at 0, O at 1, R at 2\n\nBoth test O at 1 and R at a new position (0 or 2).\n\nBut ""WORDY"" has R at 2, which is the middle, and we haven\'t tested that. Also, in ""ROWDY"", R is at 0, which is the first letter.\n\nWe don\'t have a strong preference, but note that in ""WORDY"", we are testing W at 0 and D at 3, Y at 4, same as ""ROWDY"" but with different arrangement.\n\nBut ""WORDY"" might be less common? But it\'s a valid word.\n\nAnother point: we know that in the secret word, R cannot be at 1 or 3, so position 2 is a possibility. Similarly, position 0 and 4.\n\nI think both are acceptable.\n\nBut let\'s see the commonality. ""ROWDY"" is more common than ""WORDY""? Not sure.\n\nWe can choose ""WORDY"" to test R in the middle.\n\nBut I recall that in Wordle, common words are better, but both are valid.\n\nTo break the tie, note that in ""ROWDY"", we have R at 0 and O at 1, which are adjacent. In ""WORDY"", O and R are adjacent at positions 1 and 2. But that might not matter.\n\nAnother word: ""DOZER"" excluded.\n\n""FJORD"" has O at 2, which we cannot use.\n\nI think ""WORDY"" is fine.\n\nBut let me check: ""WORDY"" is an adjective meaning using too many words, so it\'s valid.\n\nSimilarly, ""ROWDY"" is also valid.\n\nI\'ll go with ""WORDY"" because it tests R at position 2, which we haven\'t tried, and O at position 1.\n\nSo guess: ""WORDY""\n\nBut let\'s write it in uppercase: ""WORDY""\n\nNow, to summarize:\n\nWe are guessing ""WORDY"" to test:\n- R at position 2 (new position)\n- O at position 1 (new position)\n- And letters W, D, Y which are new.\n\nWe hope to get feedback that might confirm positions for R and O or reveal new letters.\n\nIf we get a correct for R or O, that would be great.\n\nBut even if not, we\'ll know more about the positions.\n\nSo, third guess: WORDYBased on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)  \n  - R is in the word but not in position 1 (second letter).  \n  - C, A, N, E are not in the word.  \n\n- **Guess 2: SPORT** → Feedback: S(x), P(x), O(-), R(-), T(x)  \n  - O is in the word but not in position 2 (third letter).  \n  - R is in the word but not in position 3 (fourth letter).  \n  - S, P, T are not in the word.  \n\n### Key Insights:\n- **Confirmed in the word**: R and O must appear, but with position constraints:  \n  - R cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (index 1 or 3, 0-indexed).  \n  - O cannot be in position 2 (index 2).  \n- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, E, S, P, T (cannot appear in the word).  \n- **Remaining positions for R**: 0, 2, or 4 (first, third, or fifth letter).  \n- **Remaining positions for O**: 0, 1, 3, or 4 (first, second, fourth, or fifth letter).  \n- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding the 7 known absent letters).  \n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- Test R in a new position (not 1 or 3) and O in a new position (not 2) to gather more positional information.  \n- Prioritize positions:  \n  - Place R at position 2 (index 2) to test the center, as it hasn\'t been tried yet.  \n  - Place O at position 1 (index 1) to test the second letter position, which is new for O.  \n- Include new high-frequency letters (e.g., W, D, Y) to maximize information gain.  \n- Avoid excluded letters and duplicate letters (since no duplicates have been indicated yet).  \n\nThe word **""WORDY""** fits these criteria:  \n- W (position 0), O (position 1), R (position 2), D (position 3), Y (position 4).  \n- Tests R at position 2 (new) and O at position 1 (new).  \n- Introduces W, D, and Y as new letters.  \n- Valid English word (adjective, meaning ""using too many words"").  \n\nThis guess will help narrow down the positions of R and O and reveal if any of W, D, or Y are in the word.\n\n<guess>WORDY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: SPORT -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(-) R(-) T(x)\nGuess 3: WORDY -> FEEDBACK: W(x) O(-) R(✓) D(x) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the previous feedback:\n\nGuess 1: CRANE -> Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\n- R is in the word but not in position 1 (index 1, 0-based).\n\nGuess 2: SPORT -> Feedback: S(x) P(x) O(-) R(-) T(x)\n- O is in the word but not in position 2 (index 2).\n- R is in the word but not in position 3 (index 3).\n\nGuess 3: WORDY -> Feedback: W(x) O(-) R(✓) D(x) Y(x)\n- R is in the correct position!

Similarly, last two letters.\n\nWords: e.g., ""OGRER"" but duplicate R? And G, E? E is excluded. Duplicate R might be issue, but we don\'t know.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""OUIJA"" has U, I, J, A? A excluded. Invalid.\n- ""OLLER"" has L, but E? Excluded. Also, duplicate L? Not good.\n\nBetter: ""OILER""? But E excluded.\n\n""OAKER""? A and E issues.\n\nIt\'s hard without vowels.

Duplicate R? And positions: F0, U1, R2, O3, R4. Duplicate R and R at position 2 (fixed) and 4? But R is fixed at 2, so having another R might be possible? We don\'t know. But ""FUROR"" has A? No, F,U,R,O,R. But duplicate R. And the word ends with R.\n\nBut D and Y are out, but R is allowed? Duplicates may be possible but we haven\'t seen one yet.\n\nBut ""FUROR"" is a word? Fury is, but furor? Yes, it\'s valid.\n\nLetters: F, U, R, O; with duplicate R? In ""FUROR"", it\'s F-U-R-O-R, so it has R at position 2 and 4. But we know position 2 is R, so if there is another R, it might be at 4.\n\nBut we have O at position 3.\n\nHowever, the word must be checked against excluded letters: F,U,R,O,R. R is allowed, but F,U,O are new. Excluded letters don\'t include these.\n\nBut we also have the constraint that O must not be at position 2 (which it isn\'t, it\'s at 3) and R is at 2, correct.\n\nBut duplicate R: we don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters, but it\'s possible.\n\nAnother word without duplicate: ""BIROS""?

E and T excluded.\n\nIt\'s challenging.\n\nPerhaps ""MORRO""? M,O,R,R,O? Duplicate O and R? But R at position 2? M0, O1, R2, R3, O4. O at position 1? But in this guess, if we put O at position 1, we know from Guess 3 that O is not at position 1? In Guess 3, WORDY had O at position 1 and it was wrong position, so O is not at position 1.\n\nSo we cannot use O at position 1.\n\nSimilarly, O cannot be at position 2.\n\nIn ""MORRO"", O is at 1 and 4. But position 1 is not allowed for O, so if we try ""MORRO"", the O at 1 would be wrong, and at 4 might be correct or wrong.\n\nBut we shouldn\'t put O at position 1 because we know it\'s not there.\n\nSo for O at position 4, the word should not have O at 1 or 2.\n\nSimilarly, for other positions.\n\nBack to O at position 3: _ _ R O _\n\nWe can try to use common letters.\n\nPossible words:\n- The first two letters: let\'s say B and U: ""BURRO""? B,U,R,R,O? Duplicate R and O at 3? B0, U1, R2, R3, O4? For O at position 4? I need O at position 3.\n\nIf O is at position 3, the pattern is _ _ R O _\n\nSo after R must be O, then another letter.\n\nSo ""___RO"" but the last letter is not O, it\'s O at the fourth position, so the word should end with something after O.\n\nPattern: positions: 0:?, 1:?, 2:R, 3:O, 4:?\n\nSo it must be a letter at position 4.\n\nFor example:\n- ""FROWN"" has N? Excluded.\n- ""BROWN"" has N? Excluded.\n- ""CROOK"" has C and K? C excluded, K is available? C excluded? C is in excluded list. And O at 3? B0,R1,O2? We need R at 2, so not.\n\nBetter: ""MICRO"" M,I,C,R,O -> C excluded.\n\n""TROOP"" T and P excluded.\n\nSince S,P,T are excluded, avoid.\n\nAnother: ""QUERO"" not common.\n\nMaybe ""VEROO"" not.\n\nPerhaps ""HIRO"" is 4 letters.\n\n""FIORD""? But that\'s Fjord spelling variation? And D is excluded? No, D is in excluded? D: in Guess 3, D was marked x, so D not in word.\n\nD is excluded.\n\nIn Guess 3, WORDY had D at position 3 and it was x, so D not present.\n\nSimilarly, Y not, W not.\n\nSo excluded: C,A,N,E,S,P,T,W,D,Y\n\nAvailable: B,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,Q,R,U,V,X,Z\n\nAnd O must be placed.\n\nNow, O at position 3: word pattern: _ _ R O ?\n\nPosition 4: needs a letter, say L: ""BAROL""? Not a word.\n\nWith U: ""CURIO""? C is excluded.\n\n""BURIO"" not valid.\n\n""FERIO"" not common.\n\n""HERO"" too short.\n\n""ZERO"" Z,E,R,O -> E excluded.\n\nJ: ""JERBO"" J,E,R,B,O -> E excluded.\n\nL: ""LORRO""? Not common.\n\nM: ""MAROO"" not.\n\nPerhaps ""GROOF"" not valid.\n\nThis is tough.\n\nMaybe O at position 0 is easier.\n\nO at 0: O _ R _ _\n\nPosition 1: must be a consonant, say G: ""OGRES""? E excluded.\n\n""OGHAM"" G,H,A,M -> A excluded.\n\n""OGIVE"" E? Excluded.\n\n""OGRIS"" not common.\n\n""OLEIC"" E? Excluded.\n\n""OLIOS"" duplicate O? And O at 0 and 4? But we don\'t know.\n\n""OPING"" O at 0, P is excluded.\n\n""OUBIT"" U,B,I,T -> T excluded.\n\n""OUPHE"" E and U? E excluded.\n\nNot working.\n\nO at position 4: _ _ R _ O\n\nFor example:\n- ""BURDO"" not valid.\n- ""FERMO"" E excluded.\n- ""GIRZO"" not.\n- ""HORMO"" H,O,R,M,O? Duplicate O? And O at 1 not allowed.\n- ""JARUL"" not.\n\nPerhaps ""VIRGO"" V,I,R,G,O. Positions: V0, I1, R2, G3, O4.\n\nLetters: V,I,G,O. All available? Excluded? V,I,G not excluded.\n\nAnd O at position 4.\n\nAlso, does not have O at position 1 or 2? Yes, position 1 is I, and O at 4.\n\nSo ""VIRGO"" is a word (astrology sign).\n\nCheck against constraints:\n- R at position 2: fixed and correct.\n- O at position 4: we want to test O at a new position.\n- Letters: V,I,G,O,R. V,I,G new.\n\nAlso, avoids excluded letters.\n\nSo it should work.\n\nWe can test if O is at position 4.\n\nSimilarly, we want to test other possibilities? But we have only one guess.\n\nAnother option: O at position 3? But we couldn\'t find a good word for that.\n\nBut ""FUROR"" came to mind: F,U,R,O,R? But duplicate R? And O at position 3? In ""FUROR"": F0, U1, R2, O3, R4. Yes, O at position 3.\n\nBut duplicate R at position 4? R is already at position 2, so if the word has two R\'s, that might be possible.\n\nBut we don\'t know.\n\n""FUROR"" has R twice, but it\'s allowed if the secret word has multiple R\'s.\n\nBut so far, we have no evidence of duplicates.\n\n""VIRGO"" only has one R.\n\nBoth are valid.\n\nNow, which one to choose?\n\n""VIRGO"": tests O at position 4.\n""FUROR"": tests O at position 3 and possible duplicate R.\n\nWe also have to consider the letters.\n\nIn ""VIRGO"", we test V, I, G.\n\nIn ""FUROR"", we test F, U, and see if R appears again.\n\nBoth are good.\n\nBut note, in ""FUROR"", position 4 is R, which is not the fixed R; it\'s an additional R. And we know R is not at position 1 or 3, but position 4 hasn\'t been tested for R? We haven\'t tried R at position 4.\n\nBut we know R is in the word at position 2, so if there is a duplicate, it could be elsewhere.\n\nBut we don\'t have information on duplicates.\n\nTo test specifically for O\'s position, it\'s better to try ""VIRGO"" to test O at position 4 without introducing a duplicate.\n\nSimilarly, we can test O at position 3 later if needed.\n\nSince we have limited guesses, ""VIRGO"" might be safer.\n\nAnother word for O at position 3: ""GIROS"" but S excluded.\n\n""BIROS"" same issue.\n\n""LIROT"" T excluded? And L,I,R,O,T. T excluded.\n\n Not good.\n\n""MUROW"" W excluded.\n\nSo ""FUROR"" is one option, but it has duplicate R.\n\nAlternatively, ""VIRGO"" is duplicate-free.\n\nWe can choose ""VIRGO"".\n\nAlso, we haven\'t tested V, I, G, which are common.\n\nSo I think ""VIRGO"" is a good guess.\n\nTherefore, fourth guess: VIRGO\n\nPosition breakdown: \n- 0: V\n- 1: I\n- 2: R (fixed and known to be correct, so will show as ✓)\n- 3: G\n- 4: O\n\nWe can predict that R will be ✓, and feedback for V, I, G, O will depend.\n\nWe hope that if O is at 4, it shows correct, or else wrong position or not.\n\nSo let\'s go with that.### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Current Constraints from Previous Feedback**:\n   - **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)  \n     - R is in the word but not in position 1 (0-based index: index 1).  \n     - C, A, N, E are not in the word.  \n   \n   - **Guess 2: SPORT** → Feedback: S(x), P(x), O(-), R(-), T(x)  \n     - O is in the word but not in position 2 (index 2).  \n     - R is in the word but not in position 3 (index 3).  \n     - S, P, T are not in the word.  \n   \n   - **Guess 3: WORDY** → Feedback: W(x), O(-), R(✓), D(x), Y(x)  \n     - R is correct at position 2 (index 2, 0-based); the third letter is **R**. Word pattern: `_ _ R _ _ ?`.  \n     - O is in the word but not in position 1 (index 1).  \n     - W, D, Y are not in the word.  \n\n2. **Key Inferences**:\n   - **R Position**: Fixed at index 2 (third letter).  \n     - Confirmed positions: R cannot be at index 1 (from Guess 1) or index 3 (from Guess 2), so it must be at index 2 (as now confirmed).  \n   - **O Position**: Must be in the word, but not at index 1 (from WORDY feedback) or index 2 (from SPORT feedback). Remaining possible positions: index 0 (first letter), index 3 (fourth letter), or index 4 (fifth letter).  \n   - **Excluded Letters**: C, A, N, E, S, P, T, W, D, Y (all marked ""x"" at least once).  \n   - **Available Letters**: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, R, U, V, X, Z. R is fixed at index 2, so it cannot appear elsewhere unless duplicated (no evidence of duplicates yet). O must appear once at an untested position (0, 3, or 4).  \n\n3. **Strategy for Guess 4**:\n   - **Prioritize testing O positions**: Since O has only three possible untested positions (0, 3, 4), choose a word that tests one of these while introducing new common letters to gather more information.  \n   - **Position Focus**: Testing O at index 4 (fifth letter) is efficient, as index 0 and 3 can be covered in later guesses if needed.  \n   - **Letter Selection**: Use available consonants (e.g., V, I, G) that are common and untested. Avoid excluded letters and duplicates.  \n   - Word pattern: `_ _ R _ O` (to test O at index 4).  \n\n4. **Word Choice**:\n   - **Candidate: ""VIRGO""** (a valid English word meaning a zodiac sign or ""virgin"").  \n     - Fits pattern: `V (index 0), I (index 1), R (index 2, confirmed ✓), G (index 3), O (index 4)`.  \n     - Tests O at position 4 (new).  \n     - Introduces new letters V, I, G (all high-frequency, maximizing information gain).  \n     - Avoids excluded letters and duplicates.  \n   - **Alternatives considered**:  \n     - O at index 0: Options like ""OUIJA"" or ""OAKER"" fail due to excluded letters (A, E) or invalidity.  \n     - O at index 3: Words like ""FUROR"" (O at index 3) introduce duplicate R, which is risky without evidence of duplicates; ""BIROS"" or ""LIROT"" are invalid due to excluded letters (S, T).  \n     - ""VIRGO"" efficiently balances position testing and new letter coverage.  \n\n5. **Expected Feedback**:  \n   - R at index 2 will show as ✓ (already confirmed).  \n   - Results for V, I, G, and O will provide new info:  \n     - O at index 4: If ✓, position solved; if - , O must be at index 0 or 3.  \n     - V, I, G feedback will reveal if any are in the word and their positions.  \n\n6. **Remaining Guesses**: 2 guesses left if needed (after this).\n\n<guess>VIRGO</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: SPORT -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(-) R(-) T(x)\nGuess 3: WORDY -> FEEDBACK: W(x) O(-) R(✓) D(x) Y(x)\nGuess 4: VIRGO -> FEEDBACK: V(x) I(x) R(✓) G(x) O(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
  - R is in the word but not in position 1 (index 1, 0-based).
  - C, A, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: SPORT -> S(x) P(x) O(-) R(-) T(x)
  - O is in the word but not in position 2 (index 2).
  - R is in the word but not in position 3 (index 3).
  - S, P, T are not in the word.

Guess 3: WORDY -> W(x) O(-) R(✓) D(x) Y(x)
  - R is correct at position 2 (index 2). So the third letter is R: _ _ R _ _
  - O is in the word but not in position 1 (index 1).
  - W, D, Y are not in the word.

Guess 4: VIRGO -> V(x) I(x) R(✓) G(x) O(-)
  - R is correct at position 2 (index 2) again, which we know.
  - O is in the word but not in position 4 (index 4).
  - V, I, G are not in the word.

Now, combining the information:

1. The word has the pattern: _ _ R _ _ (third letter is R).

2. O is in the word, but:
   - Not at position 1 (from WORDY)
   - Not at position 2 (from SPORT, and position 2 is R so it can't be anyway)
   - Not at position 4 (from VIRGO)
   - Therefore, O must be at position 3 (index 3, the fourth letter). The only remaining position is index 3.

So the word is: _ _ R O _

3. Excluded letters: C, A, N, E, S, P, T, W, D, Y, V, I, G (all marked 'x' in at least one guess).

4. Available letters: B, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, X, Z (and O and R are already placed, but we need to fill the first two and last positions).

But note: O is now placed at position 3? Let me confirm.

We have positions: 0,1,2,3,4
- Position 2: R (fixed)
- O must be in the word, and the only position left for O is 3? Because:
  - Position 0: not tested for O? But we don't know if it's at 0? 
  - From feedback: 
      - Guess 2: O not at 2
      - Guess 3: O not at 1
      - Guess 4: O not at 4
  - So the only positions left are 0 and 3? But position 0 hasn't been tested for O.

Wait, position 0 hasn't been tested? In the guesses so far, we haven't placed O at position 0.

But we know O is in the word and not at positions 1,2,4. So it must be at position 0 or 3? But position 0 is the first letter.

In the pattern _ _ R _ _, we have positions 0,1,2,3,4. Position 2 is R. O cannot be at 1,2,4. So it must be at 0 or 3.

But in the feedback from VIRGO, O was at position 4 and it was marked as wrong position (-), meaning O is in the word but not at 4. Similarly, from WORDY, O at 1 was wrong position, and from SPORT, O at 2 was wrong position.

So O must be at position 0 or 3.

But we have the pattern: _ _ R _ _

If O is at position 0, then the word is O _ R _ _

If O is at position 3, then the word is _ _ R O _

We need to determine which one.

Also, we have to fill the other positions with available letters.

But we have two possibilities for O.

Now, we have only two guesses left (if we count, we are on the fifth guess).

We need to choose a word that can test between these two cases.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has O at position 3 and tests the other letters, or one that has O at position 0.

But we also need to test the remaining letters.

Available letters: B, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, X, Z

We can try to form words for both cases.

First, if O is at position 3: pattern _ _ R O _

The first two letters and the last letter need to be filled with available letters.

Possible words:
- With common letters: e.g., ""BURRO"" but R is at 2 and 4? But we have R at 2, so if we put R at 4, it might be duplicate. Also, B and U: B0, U1, R2, O3, R4? But we don't know about duplicates. Also, U is available.

But ""BURRO"" has duplicate R and O at 3? But O at 3 is what we are testing.

But let's see if it's valid.

Another: ""FUROR"" we thought earlier, but F is available? F is available, but in ""FUROR"": F0, U1, R2, O3, R4. Duplicate R.

But we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

But we can avoid for now.

Without duplicate: we need a word that ends with a letter other than R.

For example, ""BROLO""? Not a word.

""KROON"" has O at 3? K0, R1, O2, O3, N? But N is excluded, and O at 2 is not allowed (position 2 is R, fixed).

Position 2 is R, so we cannot put O there.

Pattern: _ _ R O _ -> so position 0,1, and 4 to fill.

With available letters: B, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, X, Z

For position 4: it must be a consonant, say L: then we need a word like ? ? R O L

Examples: ""CAROL"" has C and A, excluded.

""FROWL"" has F, R, O, W, L? But W is excluded.

W is excluded from Guess 3.

""BROIL"" has B, R, O, I, L? But I is excluded from Guess 4.

I is excluded.

""GROWL"" G excluded.

Not working.

""MUROX"" not a word.

Perhaps ""HURON"" but H,U,R,O,N? N excluded.

This is difficult.

Now, if O is at position 0: pattern O _ R _ _

Then positions: 0:O, 1:?, 2:R, 3:?, 4:?

Available letters for position 1,3,4: B, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, X, Z

And O at 0.

For example, ""OURLY"" but Y excluded.

""OUBIT"" T excluded.

""OUPHE"" E excluded.

""OUNCE"" E and C excluded.

""OUNCE"" not valid.

""OORIE"" E and O duplicate? O at 0 and 1? But position 1 is O? But we know O cannot be at position 1 from Guess 3? In Guess 3, WORDY had O at 1 and it was wrong position, so O is not at position 1. So we cannot have O at position 1.

Therefore, in the pattern O _ R _ _, position 1 cannot be O, so it must be a different letter.

Similarly, position 3 and 4.

So for O at 0: O ? R ? ? with ? not O and not excluded.

Words: ""OFLRY"" not valid.

""OAKER"" A excluded.

""OCHER"" C and E excluded.

""OGRES"" E and G excluded.

""OHMIC"" H,M,I,C? I and C excluded.

""OLEIC"" E and I excluded.

""OLIOS"" duplicate O? O at 0 and 3? But position 3 O? But we don't know, but we have to avoid duplicate for now? And S excluded.

""OMBRE"" E excluded.

""ONCER"" E and C excluded.

""OORIE"" E excluded.

""OPING"" P and G excluded? P excluded, G excluded.

""ORLOP"" O at 0 and 3? Duplicate O? And P excluded.

""OUPED"" E and D excluded.

""OUTBY"" T and Y excluded.

""OUZEL"" E and Z? Z available, but E excluded.

""OVULE"" E and V excluded.

None seem to work.

Perhaps we missed a word.

Another idea: maybe the word has duplicate letters? For example, if O is at both 0 and 3? But we don't know.

But let's list all possible words that fit the pattern and use available letters.

Pattern: _ _ R _ _

With O in the word at either position 0 or 3.

And available letters: B, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, X, Z

Also, the word must contain O.

So for O at position 0: O _ R _ _

Then the word must have O at 0, then a letter from available at 1, then R at 2, then a letter at 3 and 4 from available.

And the letter at 1,3,4 cannot be excluded.

Possible letters for position 1: B,F,H,J,K,L,M,Q,U,X,Z

Position 3 and 4: same.

And the word must be valid.

For example:
- ""OUBER"" not valid.
- ""OULRY"" not.
- ""OUMAS"" not common.
- ""OURIE"" not valid.

""OUNCE"" not.

Perhaps ""OFLRY"" not.

Maybe ""OAKER"" not.

This is not working.

For O at position 3: _ _ R O _

Then positions 0,1,4 to fill with available letters.

For example:
- ""BUROO"" not valid.
- ""FUROL"" not.
- ""HUROS"" S excluded.
- ""JUROK"" not.
- ""KUROO"" not.
- ""MUROX"" not.
- ""QUORO"" not.

""FUROR"" is a valid word: F0, U1, R2, O3, R4.

Letters: F, U, R, O, R. R is duplicated, but R is already fixed at position 2, so if the word has another R at 4, it's possible.

And F and U are available.

Also, O is at position 3.

So ""FUROR"" is a candidate.

Another possibility: ""BURRO"" B0, U1, R2, O3, R4. Also valid.

""BURRO"" is a word.

Both have duplicate R.

But we don't have evidence against duplicates.

Another word: ""MURO"" is 4 letters.

""KROON"" has O at 3? K0, R1, O2, O3, N4? But position 2 is O? But we have R fixed at position 2, so cannot. And N excluded.

Not.

""LORDO"" L,O,R,D,O? D excluded and duplicate O.

Not.

So the only common words seem to be ""FUROR"" and ""BURRO"", both with duplicate R.

We can choose one.

But let's see the feedback we would get.

If we guess ""FUROR"", what would the feedback be?

Position 0: F
Position 1: U
Position 2: R (correct, ✓)
Position 3: O
Position 4: R

Now, we know R is at position 2, so that will be ✓.

O is at position 3. If the secret word has O at position 3, it will be ✓. If not, it might be - or x, but we think it should be at 3.

But we are not sure if O is at 0 or 3.

In ""FUROR"", if the secret word has O at position 0, then O at position 3 would be marked as - if it's in the word but wrong position, or x if not, but since O is in the word, it would be -.

But we also have R at position 4. If the secret word has only one R, then R at position 4 would be marked as x or -? If there is no duplicate, then R at 4 is not present, so x. But if there is duplicate, it might be - or ✓ if position 4 is R.

But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has O at position 3 and a different letter at position 4, but we couldn't find one.

Another idea: what if we test O at position 0 with a word that has O at 0 and uses common letters.

For example, ""OUBIT"" is not valid.

""OUNCE"" not.

""OULAK"" not.

Perhaps ""OUJDA"" not.

Maybe ""OKRUG"" not common.

I think we have to go with ""FUROR"" or ""BURRO"".

Let's choose ""FUROR"" as it is a valid word.

But we have to consider that if O is at position 0, then ""FUROR"" would have O at 3 which is wrong position, and we might not solve.

But we have two guesses left, so we can recover.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that has O at position 3 and also tests other letters, and if it's not, then O must be at 0.

But we have to find such a word.

Since we have only two positions for O (0 or 3), we can guess a word with O at 3 and see.

If it's not, then O is at 0.

So for guess 5, we can guess a word with O at position 3.

""FUROR"" is one.

But let's see if there is a word without duplicate.

For example, ""BUOYS"" S excluded.

""CLOYS"" C and S excluded.

""JOYED"" D and Y excluded.

""LOYAL"" A and L? L is available, but A excluded.

""MOYLS"" not valid.

""NOYAU"" A and U? A excluded.

""QUOIF"" Q,U,O,I,F? I excluded.

Not working.

""SULCI"" S excluded.

So ""FUROR"" or ""BURRO"" are the options.

I'll go with ""FUROR"".

So guess: FUROR

But let's see the feedback we got so far.

Another thought: in Guess 4, VIRGO had O at 4 and it was marked as - , meaning O is in the word but not at 4. So if we put O at 3 in ""FUROR"", it might be correct.

Similarly, if we put O at 0 in a guess, it might be correct.

But we don't have a good word for O at 0.

So for now, ""FUROR"" is a reasonable guess.

So fifth guess: FUROR

But let's format it.
</think>
### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Current Constraints from Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
     - R is in the word but not at position 1 (index 1, 0-based).  
     - C, A, N, E are excluded.  
   
   - **Guess 2: SPORT** → Feedback: S(x), P(x), O(-), R(-), T(x)  
     - O is in the word but not at position 2 (index 2).  
     - R is in the word but not at position 3 (index 3).  
     - S, P, T are excluded.  
   
   - **Guess 3: WORDY** → Feedback: W(x), O(-), R(✓), D(x), Y(x)  
     - R is correct at position 2 (index 2); word pattern: `_ _ R _ _`.  
     - O is in the word but not at position 1 (index 1).  
     - W, D, Y are excluded.  
   
   - **Guess 4: VIRGO** → Feedback: V(x), I(x), R(✓), G(x), O(-)  
     - R is correct at position 2 (index 2), confirming the pattern `_ _ R _ _`.  
     - O is in the word but not at position 4 (index 4).  
     - V, I, G are excluded.  

2. **Key Inferences**:
   - **Fixed Position**: R is locked at index 2 (third letter).  
   - **O Position**: O must be in the word but cannot be at positions 1, 2, or 4 (from feedback). The only remaining positions are index 0 (first letter) or index 3 (fourth letter).  
   - **Excluded Letters**: C, A, N, E, S, P, T, W, D, Y, V, I, G (all marked ""x"" at least once).  
   - **Available Letters**: B, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, X, Z (must be used for positions 0, 1, and 4).  
   - **Word Pattern**: `_ _ R _ _` with O at index 0 or 3.  

3. **Strategy for Guess 5**:
   - **Test O at Position 3**: Since O cannot be at positions 1, 2, or 4, position 3 (fourth letter) is a high-probability candidate. Testing this efficiently narrows down O's location.  
   - **Cover New Letters**: Use available consonants (e.g., F, U, R) to maximize information. R is fixed at index 2, but duplicates are possible (no evidence against them yet).  
   - **Word Choice**: ""FUROR"" fits:  
     - Positions: F (index 0), U (index 1), R (index 2, ✓), O (index 3), R (index 4).  
     - Tests O at index 3 (critical for solving position).  
     - Tests F and U (new letters) and checks for R duplication at index 4.  
     - Valid English word (meaning ""a general commotion or uproar"").  

4. **Expected Outcomes**:
   - If O is at index 3, it will show as ✓ or - (confirming position).  
   - Feedback on F, U, and the second R (index 4) will reveal if they are in the word and their positions.  
   - If O is not at index 3, it must be at index 0, and we can adjust the final guess accordingly.  

<guess>FUROR</guess>",FUROR,"We have the feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
  - R is in the word but not in position 1 (index 1, 0-based).
  - C, A, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: SPORT -> S(x) P(x) O(-) R(-) T(x)
  - O is in the word but not in position 2 (index 2).
  - R is in the word but not in position 3 (index 3).
  - S, P, T are not in the word.

Guess 3: WORDY -> W(x) O(-) R(✓) D(x) Y(x)
  - R is correct at position 2 (index 2). So the third letter is R: _ _ R _ _
  - O is in the word but not in position 1 (index 1).
  - W, D, Y are not in the word.

Guess 4: VIRGO -> V(x) I(x) R(✓) G(x) O(-)
  - R is correct at position 2 (index 2) again, which we know.
  - O is in the word but not in position 4 (index 4).
  - V, I, G are not in the word.

Now, combining the information:

1. The word has the pattern: _ _ R _ _ (third letter is R).

2. O is in the word, but:
   - Not at position 1 (from WORDY)
   - Not at position 2 (from SPORT, and position 2 is R so it can't be anyway)
   - Not at position 4 (from VIRGO)
   - Therefore, O must be at position 3 (index 3, the fourth letter). The only remaining position is index 3.

So the word is: _ _ R O _

3. Excluded letters: C, A, N, E, S, P, T, W, D, Y, V, I, G (all marked 'x' in at least one guess).

4. Available letters: B, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, X, Z (and O and R are already placed, but we need to fill the first two and last positions).

But note: O is now placed at position 3? Let me confirm.

We have positions: 0,1,2,3,4
- Position 2: R (fixed)
- O must be in the word, and the only position left for O is 3? Because:
  - Position 0: not tested for O? But we don't know if it's at 0? 
  - From feedback: 
      - Guess 2: O not at 2
      - Guess 3: O not at 1
      - Guess 4: O not at 4
  - So the only positions left are 0 and 3? But position 0 hasn't been tested for O.

Wait, position 0 hasn't been tested? In the guesses so far, we haven't placed O at position 0.

But we know O is in the word and not at positions 1,2,4. So it must be at position 0 or 3? But position 0 is the first letter.

In the pattern _ _ R _ _, we have positions 0,1,2,3,4. Position 2 is R. O cannot be at 1,2,4. So it must be at 0 or 3.

But in the feedback from VIRGO, O was at position 4 and it was marked as wrong position (-), meaning O is in the word but not at 4. Similarly, from WORDY, O at 1 was wrong position, and from SPORT, O at 2 was wrong position.

So O must be at position 0 or 3.

But we have the pattern: _ _ R _ _

If O is at position 0, then the word is O _ R _ _

If O is at position 3, then the word is _ _ R O _

We need to determine which one.

Also, we have to fill the other positions with available letters.

But we have two possibilities for O.

Now, we have only two guesses left (if we count, we are on the fifth guess).

We need to choose a word that can test between these two cases.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has O at position 3 and tests the other letters, or one that has O at position 0.

But we also need to test the remaining letters.

Available letters: B, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, X, Z

We can try to form words for both cases.

First, if O is at position 3: pattern _ _ R O _

The first two letters and the last letter need to be filled with available letters.

Possible words:
- With common letters: e.g., ""BURRO"" but R is at 2 and 4? But we have R at 2, so if we put R at 4, it might be duplicate. Also, B and U: B0, U1, R2, O3, R4? But we don't know about duplicates. Also, U is available.

But ""BURRO"" has duplicate R and O at 3? But O at 3 is what we are testing.

But let's see if it's valid.

Another: ""FUROR"" we thought earlier, but F is available? F is available, but in ""FUROR"": F0, U1, R2, O3, R4. Duplicate R.

But we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

But we can avoid for now.

Without duplicate: we need a word that ends with a letter other than R.

For example, ""BROLO""? Not a word.

""KROON"" has O at 3? K0, R1, O2, O3, N? But N is excluded, and O at 2 is not allowed (position 2 is R, fixed).

Position 2 is R, so we cannot put O there.

Pattern: _ _ R O _ -> so position 0,1, and 4 to fill.

With available letters: B, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, X, Z

For position 4: it must be a consonant, say L: then we need a word like ? ? R O L

Examples: ""CAROL"" has C and A, excluded.

""FROWL"" has F, R, O, W, L? But W is excluded.

W is excluded from Guess 3.

""BROIL"" has B, R, O, I, L? But I is excluded from Guess 4.

I is excluded.

""GROWL"" G excluded.

Not working.

""MUROX"" not a word.

Perhaps ""HURON"" but H,U,R,O,N? N excluded.

This is difficult.

Now, if O is at position 0: pattern O _ R _ _

Then positions: 0:O, 1:?, 2:R, 3:?, 4:?

Available letters for position 1,3,4: B, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, X, Z

And O at 0.

For example, ""OURLY"" but Y excluded.

""OUBIT"" T excluded.

""OUPHE"" E excluded.

""OUNCE"" E and C excluded.

""OUNCE"" not valid.

""OORIE"" E and O duplicate? O at 0 and 1? But position 1 is O? But we know O cannot be at position 1 from Guess 3? In Guess 3, WORDY had O at 1 and it was wrong position, so O is not at position 1. So we cannot have O at position 1.

Therefore, in the pattern O _ R _ _, position 1 cannot be O, so it must be a different letter.

Similarly, position 3 and 4.

So for O at 0: O ? R ? ? with ? not O and not excluded.

Words: ""OFLRY"" not valid.

""OAKER"" A excluded.

""OCHER"" C and E excluded.

""OGRES"" E and G excluded.

""OHMIC"" H,M,I,C? I and C excluded.

""OLEIC"" E and I excluded.

""OLIOS"" duplicate O? O at 0 and 3? But position 3 O? But we don't know, but we have to avoid duplicate for now? And S excluded.

""OMBRE"" E excluded.

""ONCER"" E and C excluded.

""OORIE"" E excluded.

""OPING"" P and G excluded? P excluded, G excluded.

""ORLOP"" O at 0 and 3? Duplicate O? And P excluded.

""OUPED"" E and D excluded.

""OUTBY"" T and Y excluded.

""OUZEL"" E and Z? Z available, but E excluded.

""OVULE"" E and V excluded.

None seem to work.

Perhaps we missed a word.

Another idea: maybe the word has duplicate letters? For example, if O is at both 0 and 3? But we don't know.

But let's list all possible words that fit the pattern and use available letters.

Pattern: _ _ R _ _

With O in the word at either position 0 or 3.

And available letters: B, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, X, Z

Also, the word must contain O.

So for O at position 0: O _ R _ _

Then the word must have O at 0, then a letter from available at 1, then R at 2, then a letter at 3 and 4 from available.

And the letter at 1,3,4 cannot be excluded.

Possible letters for position 1: B,F,H,J,K,L,M,Q,U,X,Z

Position 3 and 4: same.

And the word must be valid.

For example:
- ""OUBER"" not valid.
- ""OULRY"" not.
- ""OUMAS"" not common.
- ""OURIE"" not valid.

""OUNCE"" not.

Perhaps ""OFLRY"" not.

Maybe ""OAKER"" not.

This is not working.

For O at position 3: _ _ R O _

Then positions 0,1,4 to fill with available letters.

For example:
- ""BUROO"" not valid.
- ""FUROL"" not.
- ""HUROS"" S excluded.
- ""JUROK"" not.
- ""KUROO"" not.
- ""MUROX"" not.
- ""QUORO"" not.

""FUROR"" is a valid word: F0, U1, R2, O3, R4.

Letters: F, U, R, O, R. R is duplicated, but R is already fixed at position 2, so if the word has another R at 4, it's possible.

And F and U are available.

Also, O is at position 3.

So ""FUROR"" is a candidate.

Another possibility: ""BURRO"" B0, U1, R2, O3, R4. Also valid.

""BURRO"" is a word.

Both have duplicate R.

But we don't have evidence against duplicates.

Another word: ""MURO"" is 4 letters.

""KROON"" has O at 3? K0, R1, O2, O3, N4? But position 2 is O? But we have R fixed at position 2, so cannot. And N excluded.

Not.

""LORDO"" L,O,R,D,O? D excluded and duplicate O.

Not.

So the only common words seem to be ""FUROR"" and ""BURRO"", both with duplicate R.

We can choose one.

But let's see the feedback we would get.

If we guess ""FUROR"", what would the feedback be?

Position 0: F
Position 1: U
Position 2: R (correct, ✓)
Position 3: O
Position 4: R

Now, we know R is at position 2, so that will be ✓.

O is at position 3. If the secret word has O at position 3, it will be ✓. If not, it might be - or x, but we think it should be at 3.

But we are not sure if O is at 0 or 3.

In ""FUROR"", if the secret word has O at position 0, then O at position 3 would be marked as - if it's in the word but wrong position, or x if not, but since O is in the word, it would be -.

But we also have R at position 4. If the secret word has only one R, then R at position 4 would be marked as x or -? If there is no duplicate, then R at 4 is not present, so x. But if there is duplicate, it might be - or ✓ if position 4 is R.

But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has O at position 3 and a different letter at position 4, but we couldn't find one.

Another idea: what if we test O at position 0 with a word that has O at 0 and uses common letters.

For example, ""OUBIT"" is not valid.

""OUNCE"" not.

""OULAK"" not.

Perhaps ""OUJDA"" not.

Maybe ""OKRUG"" not common.

I think we have to go with ""FUROR"" or ""BURRO"".

Let's choose ""FUROR"" as it is a valid word.

But we have to consider that if O is at position 0, then ""FUROR"" would have O at 3 which is wrong position, and we might not solve.

But we have two guesses left, so we can recover.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that has O at position 3 and also tests other letters, and if it's not, then O must be at 0.

But we have to find such a word.

Since we have only two positions for O (0 or 3), we can guess a word with O at 3 and see.

If it's not, then O is at 0.

So for guess 5, we can guess a word with O at position 3.

""FUROR"" is one.

But let's see if there is a word without duplicate.

For example, ""BUOYS"" S excluded.

""CLOYS"" C and S excluded.

""JOYED"" D and Y excluded.

""LOYAL"" A and L? L is available, but A excluded.

""MOYLS"" not valid.

""NOYAU"" A and U? A excluded.

""QUOIF"" Q,U,O,I,F? I excluded.

Not working.

""SULCI"" S excluded.

So ""FUROR"" or ""BURRO"" are the options.

I'll go with ""FUROR"".

So guess: FUROR

But let's see the feedback we got so far.

Another thought: in Guess 4, VIRGO had O at 4 and it was marked as - , meaning O is in the word but not at 4. So if we put O at 3 in ""FUROR"", it might be correct.

Similarly, if we put O at 0 in a guess, it might be correct.

But we don't have a good word for O at 0.

So for now, ""FUROR"" is a reasonable guess.

So fifth guess: FUROR

But let's format it.### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Current Constraints from Previous Feedback**:

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

As this is my first guess, I don't have any prior feedback to work with. The optimal approach is to choose a starting word that maximizes information gain by including:
- Common English letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words (E, A, R, S, T, etc.)
- A mix of vowels and consonants to cover more possibilities
- No repeating letters to check more distinct characters

Considering these principles, ""CRANE"" is an excellent first guess because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, E) and 2 common consonants (C, R, N)
2. All letters are distinct, testing 5 different characters
3. Frequently used as an opener in word games due to its balanced letter distribution

After submitting ""CRANE"", I'll analyze the feedback pattern (✓,-,x) to identify matching letters and positions, which will guide my next guess.
</thinking>

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"": 
C: x (not in the word)
R: - (in the word but wrong position)
A: x (not in the word)
N: x (not in the word)
E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since in CRANE, R is at position 2, and it's marked as wrong position).
- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter R, but not in the second position. Also, it does not contain C, A, N, E.

We have 6 tries and this was the first guess. Now we need to make a second guess.

We should choose a word that:
- Includes R (since we know it's in the word) and places it in a different position than the second (because in the first guess it was in the second and was wrong).
- Avoids the letters C, A, N, E (since they are not in the word).
- Uses other common letters to maximize the chance of getting more information.

Possible positions for R: since it's not in position 2, it could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

We also know the word is 5 letters and must be a valid English word.

Let's think of words that have R in one of the positions 1, 3, 4, 5 and avoid C, A, N, E.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, etc.

A good second guess might be a word that has R and several of these new letters.

For example, let's consider words starting with S or T, as they are common.

We can try to put R in the first position? But note: we don't know if R is in the first position or not. We only know it's not in the second.

But we can try a word that has R in a different position.

Let me list some words that have R and avoid C, A, N, E.

Example: ""ROUST"" - but that has U and O, which we haven't tested. But let's see.

Alternatively, ""TRIES"" - but that has E, which we know is not in the word. So we must avoid E.

We must avoid E because it was marked as not present.

So, we need a word without C, A, N, E.

Let me think of words with R and without these letters.

Common words: 
- ""SPORT"": has S, P, O, R, T. R is at position 4. But we don't know if O is in the word or not.
- ""STORM"": has S, T, O, R, M. R is at position 4. Also, we avoid C, A, N, E.

But note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates yet.

Another idea: ""DRUID"" - but D is a new letter, but we have to avoid A and E? ""DRUID"" has D, R, U, I, D? Wait, duplicate D? Also, it has U and I which are new.

But we know R is in the word, so we can try to use it.

But perhaps we can choose a word that has R and many common consonants and vowels that we haven't tried.

Vowels we haven't tried: O, I, U (and sometimes Y, but let's avoid Y for now).

We know the word must have at least one R, and we have 5 positions to fill without C, A, N, E.

Let me try to come up with a word that has R and uses common letters.

One classic word is ""ROUND"", but that has O, U, N, D. But N is not allowed (we know N is not in the word). So we cannot use N.

So avoid N.

Another: ""PROUD"" - has P, R, O, U, D. R is at position 2? But wait, in our first guess, R was at position 2 and it was marked as wrong position. So if we put R at position 2 again, it would still be wrong? But we don't know if the secret word has R at position 2 or not? Actually, the feedback for the first guess said R is in the word but not at position 2. So if we put R at position 2 again, it would still be marked as wrong position (if the correct position is not 2) or correct if it is? But we know it's not at position 2? Actually, the feedback only tells us that in the first guess, R was not at the correct position. But it might be that the secret word has R at position 2? No, because if it were at position 2, it would have been marked as correct (✓). But it was marked as wrong position (-), meaning R is in the word but not at position 2. Therefore, position 2 is definitely not the correct position for R.

So if we put R at position 2 again, it would still be marked as wrong position (unless the secret word has two R's and one of them is at position 2? But we don't know about duplicates). However, to avoid confusion, it might be better to put R in a different position to test a new spot.

But we don't have to avoid position 2 for R? Actually, we know that position 2 is not correct for R, so if we put R at position 2 again, we will get the same feedback (wrong position) and we don't gain new information about the position. So it's better to try R in a new position.

Therefore, for the second guess, we should put R in one of the positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Let me try to form a word without C, A, N, E and with R in a new position.

For example, position 1: R at the start.

Words: ""ROAST"" - but has A, which is not allowed. Avoid A.

""ROOST"" - has O, O, S, T. But O is repeated? And we don't know about O. Also, it has O and S, T.

But we avoid A, but O is new.

""ROOTS"" - similar.

But we can use ""ROILS"" or ""ROUPS"" but not common.

Another: ""RISKY"" - has R at position 1, I, S, K, Y. Avoids C, A, N, E. But Y is less common.

Alternatively, position 3: for example, ""BORED"" - but has E, which is not allowed.

""FORTS"" - has F, O, R, T, S. R is at position 3. Avoids C, A, N, E.

""PORTS"" - similar.

Position 4: ""SPORT"", as I thought earlier.

Position 5: ""LATER"" - but has A and E, not allowed.

""RUMOR"" - has U, M, O, R. R at the end? But also R at the beginning? Duplicate R.

We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but we can avoid for now.

After considering, I think ""SPORT"" is a good candidate:
- S, P, O, R, T
- R is at position 4 (a new position, not 2)
- Avoids C, A, N, E
- Uses common letters: S, P, O, T

Another candidate: ""STORM"" - similar, with R at position 4 and M instead of P.

But we might get more information with ""SPORT"" or ""STORM"".

Alternatively, ""TRIPS"" - has T, R, I, P, S. R at position 2? But we don't want to put R at position 2 again because we know it's not correct and we won't get new position info.

In ""TRIPS"", R is at position 2. We know position 2 is not correct for R, so we would get the same feedback for R (wrong position) and we don't learn a new position. So it's better to avoid position 2 for R in this guess.

Therefore, let's avoid words with R at position 2.

So, ""SPORT"" has R at position 4.

Similarly, ""DRIPS"" has R at position 3? D, R, I, P, S. But we don't know about D.

But ""DRIPS"" has R at position 2? No: D is position 1, R is position 2. So that's position 2 again. We don't want that.

How about ""GRIPS""? G is new, but R is at position 2 again.

We want R not at position 2.

So let's look for words with R at 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Another word: ""PURSE"" - but has E, not allowed.

""BIRDS"" - has B, I, R, D, S. R is at position 3. Avoids C, A, N, E.

But B is new.

""FIRST"" - F, I, R, S, T. R at position 3. Avoids C, A, N, E.

Similarly, ""THIRD"" - T, H, I, R, D. R at position 4.

But we have to choose one.

I think ""FIRST"" is a good choice because it has common letters: F, I, S, T and R at position 3.

But F is not the most common, but it's okay.

Alternatively, ""SPORT"" is also good.

To maximize vowel information, we can include a vowel we haven't tried. We haven't tried O, I, U.

In ""SPORT"", we have O. In ""FIRST"", we have I.

Both are good.

I'll go with ""SPORT"" because it has O, which is a common vowel, and we get to test S, P, O, T as well.

So, second guess: ""SPORT""

We hope to get feedback on these letters.

If we get a correct position for R, that would be great. But if not, we'll know more.

So, let's choose ""SPORT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, A, N, E are not in the secret word (marked as ""x"").
- R is in the word but not in the second position (marked as ""-"").

For the second guess, I need to:
- Include R (since it's in the secret word) but avoid placing it in the second position again to test a new location.
- Exclude C, A, N, E entirely.
- Use other common letters to maximize information gain (e.g., S, T, O, P).

I chose ""SPORT"" because:
- It places R in the fourth position (a new location to test).
- It avoids C, A, N, E and introduces new common letters: S, P, O, T.
- This combination helps test for vowels (O) and frequent consonants, providing broad coverage.

<guess>SPORT</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SPORT -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(-) R(-) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two guesses and their feedback:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: x (not in word)
- R: - (in word, wrong position)
- A: x (not in word)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: x (not in word)

From this, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter R, but not in the second position (index 1, if we index from 0).
- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: SPORT
- S: x (not in word)
- P: x (not in word)
- O: - (in word, wrong position)
- R: - (in word, wrong position)
- T: x (not in word)

From this, we know:
- The secret word contains O and R, but not in the positions they were guessed (O was in position 2, R was in position 3).
- The letters S, P, T are not in the word.

Combining the information:
- Letters not in the word: C, A, N, E, S, P, T
- Letters in the word: R and O (and we know they are not in positions 1 and 3 for R? Let's clarify positions).

Position indices (0-indexed for clarity):
- CRANE: positions 0:C, 1:R, 2:A, 3:N, 4:E
- SPORT: positions 0:S, 1:P, 2:O, 3:R, 4:T

From CRANE: R is in the word but not at position 1.
From SPORT: R is in the word but not at position 3, and O is in the word but not at position 2.

So R is in the word, but not at index 1 or 3. Therefore, R must be at one of the positions: 0, 2, or 4? But wait, we have 5 positions: 0,1,2,3,4.

But note: in CRANE, R was at position 1 (which is the second letter) and we know it's not there. In SPORT, R was at position 3 (the fourth letter) and it's not there. So R cannot be at position 1 or 3. Therefore, R must be at position 0, 2, or 4.

Similarly, O is in the word but not at position 2 (from SPORT). So O must be at position 0, 1, 3, or 4? But we have to consider the constraints.

Also, we know the following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, E, S, P, T.

So the secret word must contain R and O, and three other letters that are not in the excluded set.

We have 6 tries, and we are on the third guess.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Includes R and O (both must appear, but not at the positions we've already tried for them)
- Excludes C, A, N, E, S, P, T
- Tries to place R in one of the positions 0, 2, or 4 (since it can't be at 1 or 3)
- Tries to place O in a position that is not 2 (so 0,1,3,4) but note that if we place O at a position, we have to avoid the positions we know are wrong for R? They are independent.

But also, we want to test new letters to get more information.

What letters are left? We have the alphabet minus the excluded ones.

Excluded: C, A, N, E, S, P, T

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: O and R are already known to be in the word, so we need to include them.

We also want to use common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.

Common letters: among the available, we have B, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, U, etc.

We need to form a word that has R and O, and three other letters from the available set.

Moreover, we have constraints on the positions for R and O.

Let me think of words that have R and O, without the excluded letters.

For example, words like:
- FLOUR: but has F, L, O, U, R. But we have to check positions. Also, we don't know about F, L, U.
- BROIL: B, R, O, I, L. This might work.

But we need to assign positions.

We know R cannot be at position 1 or 3. So in the word we guess, we should avoid putting R at 1 or 3.

Similarly, O cannot be at position 2.

So for the next guess, we can try to put R at position 0 (the first letter) and O at position 4 (the last), for example, to test new positions.

But we have to form a valid word.

Let me list possible words:

Option 1: R at position 0, O at position 1? But position 1: we know from CRANE that R was at position 1 and it was wrong, but that doesn't say anything about O. However, we have to avoid putting R at 1, but O can be at 1.

But we don't have a constraint that O cannot be at 1. Only that it cannot be at 2.

So possible:

- R at 0, O at 1: e.g., ""ROBOT"" but has B and T? T is excluded. So not.

""ROBOT"" has T, which is excluded.

""ROOMY"" has O repeated and Y, but we don't know about Y. Also, O repeated? We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but we can avoid for now.

""ROWDY"": R, O, W, D, Y. Avoids excluded letters? W, D, Y are not excluded. So ""ROWDY"" is a candidate.

Positions: R at 0, O at 1, W at 2, D at 3, Y at 4.

But we have to check the constraints for R and O:
- R is at 0: which is allowed (not 1 or 3).
- O is at 1: which is allowed (only constraint is not at 2).

So that's okay.

But we are testing O at position 1 and R at position 0.

Another option: put R at position 2 and O at position 4.

For example, ""BROOD"" has O repeated and D, but B is allowed? ""BROOD"": B, R, O, O, D. But duplicate O? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, O is at position 2? But we know O cannot be at position 2 (from SPORT feedback). So if we put O at position 2, it would be wrong, but we already know that. So it's a waste of a position. We should avoid putting O at position 2.

Similarly, we should avoid putting R at positions 1 and 3.

So in our next guess, we should avoid:
- R at positions 1 and 3
- O at position 2

Now, back to ""ROWDY"": it uses R at 0, O at 1, and new letters W, D, Y.

But we don't know if W, D, Y are in the word. It's a good way to test them.

Another word: ""ROGUE"" but E is excluded.

""ROBIN"": R, O, B, I, N. But N is excluded (from CRANE: N is not in the word). So invalid.

""ROOMY"": O repeated and we don't know about duplicates. Also, Y is at the end.

But let's avoid duplicates for now.

""ROWDY"" seems acceptable.

Another word: ""FROWN"": F, R, O, W, N. But N is excluded.

""GROWL"": G, R, O, W, L. This avoids excluded letters. Positions: R at 1? Position 1 is the second letter. But we cannot put R at position 1 because we know it's not the correct position for R. In ""GROWL"", R is at position 1 (if we break down: G0, R1, O2, W3, L4). But we cannot put R at 1 because we know it's not there. Also, O is at position 2, which we know is not correct for O. So we would get - for both, but we already know that. So it doesn't give new position information.

We want to test new positions for R and O.

So we should try to put R at a position we haven't tried: 0, 2, or 4 (since 1 and 3 are tried and wrong).

Similarly for O, we haven't tried positions 0,1,3,4 (only 2 is tried and wrong).

So ideally, we put R at 0, 2, or 4 and O at 0,1,3,4 (but not 2) and in a way that they are in new positions.

Also, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another word: ""DOZER"" but E is excluded and R is at the end? ""DOZER"" has E and R at the end. But E is excluded.

""RUMOR"": has U, M, O, R. But duplicate R? And positions: R at 0 and 4? We don't know about duplicates. Also, O at position 3? That might be okay.

But let's avoid duplicates.

""ROBOT"" is out because of T.

""ROBIN"" is out because of N.

""ROUGE"" has E.

""ROWDY"" is a valid word and uses W, D, Y which are not tested.

Another option: ""ROYAL"" but A is excluded.

""ROUND"" has N and D? N is excluded.

""FROST"" has S and T, excluded.

""CRONY"" has C and N, excluded.

So ""ROWDY"" seems a good candidate.

But let me think of another: ""GROUT"" has T, excluded.

""BROWN"" has N, excluded.

""GROWL"" has R at position 1, which we cannot use.

What about ""MOURN""? Has U, but N is excluded.

""DOUGH"" has D, O, U, G, H. But no R? We must include R because we know R is in the word. So we have to include R.

So the word must contain R and O.

Another word: ""FJORD"" has F, J, O, R, D. Avoids excluded letters. Positions: F0, J1, O2, R3, D4.

But O is at position 2: we know O cannot be at position 2 (from SPORT feedback). So if we use this, O at 2 would be marked as wrong position, which we already know. So it doesn't help.

Similarly, R is at position 3: we know R cannot be at position 3 (from SPORT feedback). So again, we get no new position information for R and O.

We want to avoid that.

So we need a word where:
- R is at 0, 2, or 4 (new positions to test)
- O is at 0,1,3, or 4 (but not 2)

And the word must be valid.

""ROWDY"": R at 0, O at 1, W at 2, D at 3, Y at 4. This satisfies:
- R at 0: new position
- O at 1: new position (we haven't tried O at 1 before)

We haven't tried O at position 1, so it's a good test.

Similarly, we test W, D, Y.

Another possibility: ""ROBED"" but E is excluded.

""RULED"" has E and L, U, D. E excluded.

""RIFLE"" has E and F, L. E excluded.

""RHYME"" has E, H, Y, M. E excluded.

""ROBOT"" excluded.

""ROWDY"" seems one of the few options.

""ROWED"" has E, excluded.

""ROWDY"" is valid.

Another word: ""ROYAL"" has A, excluded.

""ROBES"" has E and S, excluded.

So I think ""ROWDY"" is a good choice.

But let me confirm the letters: R, O, W, D, Y. None of these are excluded (excluded are C,A,N,E,S,P,T).

So yes.

We can also consider ""DOLLY"" but no R.

Must have R.

""WORDY"": W, O, R, D, Y. This is also a word.

Positions: W0, O1, R2, D3, Y4.

Now, check constraints:
- R is at position 2: which is a new position (we haven't tried R at 2 before). We tried R at 1 and 3, so 2 is new.
- O is at position 1: which is new (we only tried O at 2 before, which was wrong).

So ""WORDY"" also satisfies.

Now, between ""ROWDY"" and ""WORDY"", which one to choose?

""ROWDY"": R at 0, O at 1
""WORDY"": W at 0, O at 1, R at 2

Both test O at 1 and R at a new position (0 or 2).

But ""WORDY"" has R at 2, which is the middle, and we haven't tested that. Also, in ""ROWDY"", R is at 0, which is the first letter.

We don't have a strong preference, but note that in ""WORDY"", we are testing W at 0 and D at 3, Y at 4, same as ""ROWDY"" but with different arrangement.

But ""WORDY"" might be less common? But it's a valid word.

Another point: we know that in the secret word, R cannot be at 1 or 3, so position 2 is a possibility. Similarly, position 0 and 4.

I think both are acceptable.

But let's see the commonality. ""ROWDY"" is more common than ""WORDY""? Not sure.

We can choose ""WORDY"" to test R in the middle.

But I recall that in Wordle, common words are better, but both are valid.

To break the tie, note that in ""ROWDY"", we have R at 0 and O at 1, which are adjacent. In ""WORDY"", O and R are adjacent at positions 1 and 2. But that might not matter.

Another word: ""DOZER"" excluded.

""FJORD"" has O at 2, which we cannot use.

I think ""WORDY"" is fine.

But let me check: ""WORDY"" is an adjective meaning using too many words, so it's valid.

Similarly, ""ROWDY"" is also valid.

I'll go with ""WORDY"" because it tests R at position 2, which we haven't tried, and O at position 1.

So guess: ""WORDY""

But let's write it in uppercase: ""WORDY""

Now, to summarize:

We are guessing ""WORDY"" to test:
- R at position 2 (new position)
- O at position 1 (new position)
- And letters W, D, Y which are new.

We hope to get feedback that might confirm positions for R and O or reveal new letters.

If we get a correct for R or O, that would be great.

But even if not, we'll know more about the positions.

So, third guess: WORDYBased on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
  - R is in the word but not in position 1 (second letter).  
  - C, A, N, E are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: SPORT** → Feedback: S(x), P(x), O(-), R(-), T(x)  
  - O is in the word but not in position 2 (third letter).  
  - R is in the word but not in position 3 (fourth letter).  
  - S, P, T are not in the word.  

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed in the word**: R and O must appear, but with position constraints:  
  - R cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (index 1 or 3, 0-indexed).  
  - O cannot be in position 2 (index 2).  
- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, E, S, P, T (cannot appear in the word).  
- **Remaining positions for R**: 0, 2, or 4 (first, third, or fifth letter).  
- **Remaining positions for O**: 0, 1, 3, or 4 (first, second, fourth, or fifth letter).  
- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding the 7 known absent letters).  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test R in a new position (not 1 or 3) and O in a new position (not 2) to gather more positional information.  
- Prioritize positions:  
  - Place R at position 2 (index 2) to test the center, as it hasn't been tried yet.  
  - Place O at position 1 (index 1) to test the second letter position, which is new for O.  
- Include new high-frequency letters (e.g., W, D, Y) to maximize information gain.  
- Avoid excluded letters and duplicate letters (since no duplicates have been indicated yet).  

The word **""WORDY""** fits these criteria:  
- W (position 0), O (position 1), R (position 2), D (position 3), Y (position 4).  
- Tests R at position 2 (new) and O at position 1 (new).  
- Introduces W, D, and Y as new letters.  
- Valid English word (adjective, meaning ""using too many words"").  

This guess will help narrow down the positions of R and O and reveal if any of W, D, or Y are in the word.

<｜Assistant｜>We have the previous feedback:

Guess 1: CRANE -> Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
- R is in the word but not in position 1 (index 1, 0-based).

Guess 2: SPORT -> Feedback: S(x) P(x) O(-) R(-) T(x)
- O is in the word but not in position 2 (index 2).
- R is in the word but not in position 3 (index 3).

Guess 3: WORDY -> Feedback: W(x) O(-) R(✓) D(x) Y(x)
- R is in the correct position! At position 2 (index 2). So the third letter is R.
- O is in the word but not in position 1 (index 1). 
- W, D, Y are not in the word.

From this, we know:
- The secret word has R as the third letter (position 2, 0-based). So the word is ? ? R ? ?.
- O is in the word, but not at position 1 (which we just tried) and not at position 2 (from Guess 2). So O must be at position 0, 3, or 4.
- Letters not in the word: C, A, N, E, S, P, T, W, D, Y (all marked 'x' in at least one guess).
- R is fixed at position 2.

Now, we need to find a word that fits:
- Third letter is R: __ __ R __ __
- Contains O somewhere, but not at position 1 or 2. So O must be at 0, 3, or 4.
- Exclude the absent letters: C, A, N, E, S, P, T, W, D, Y.

Available letters: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, R, U, V, X, Z. But R is fixed at position 2, and O must appear once (no duplicates indicated, so we assume single for now).

We need to form a word with O at position 0, 3, or 4.

Possible options:

1. O at position 0: O _ R _ _
2. O at position 3: _ _ R O _
3. O at position 4: _ _ R _ O

We need to use the available letters and form valid words.

We also have two more guesses so far (this will be fourth guess).

We want to test possible positions for O and also test more letters.

Since O has three possible positions (0,3,4), we might need to choose a word that tests O at one of these and also tests other common letters.

First, consider O at position 0: O _ R _ _

The second letter must be from available set. Similarly, last two letters.

Words: e.g., ""OGRER"" but duplicate R? And G, E? E is excluded. Duplicate R might be issue, but we don't know.

Possible words:
- ""OUIJA"" has U, I, J, A? A excluded. Invalid.
- ""OLLER"" has L, but E? Excluded. Also, duplicate L? Not good.

Better: ""OILER""? But E excluded.

""OAKER""? A and E issues.

It's hard without vowels. We have U and I available.

Another word: ""ORDER"" has E and R duplicate? E excluded.

""OUMAS""? Not common.

Perhaps O at position 0 is hard with the constraints.

Now, try O at position 3: _ _ R O _

First two letters: available letters, last letter: available.

For example:
- _ _ R O _
Possible: ""MIRRO"" not a word.
- ""FUROR"" has F, U, R, O, R? Duplicate R? And positions: F0, U1, R2, O3, R4. Duplicate R and R at position 2 (fixed) and 4? But R is fixed at 2, so having another R might be possible? We don't know. But ""FUROR"" has A? No, F,U,R,O,R. But duplicate R. And the word ends with R.

But D and Y are out, but R is allowed? Duplicates may be possible but we haven't seen one yet.

But ""FUROR"" is a word? Fury is, but furor? Yes, it's valid.

Letters: F, U, R, O; with duplicate R? In ""FUROR"", it's F-U-R-O-R, so it has R at position 2 and 4. But we know position 2 is R, so if there is another R, it might be at 4.

But we have O at position 3.

However, the word must be checked against excluded letters: F,U,R,O,R. R is allowed, but F,U,O are new. Excluded letters don't include these.

But we also have the constraint that O must not be at position 2 (which it isn't, it's at 3) and R is at 2, correct.

But duplicate R: we don't know if the word has duplicate letters, but it's possible.

Another word without duplicate: ""BIROS""? B,I,R,O,S? S excluded.

""GIRO"" is 4 letters.

""HERO"" is 4.

""KIRO"" not common.

""MURO"" not common.

""VIRO"" not common.

Perhaps ""FUROR"" is an option.

Now, O at position 4: _ _ R _ O

First two and the fourth letter.

E.g., ""BERMO""? E excluded.

""GARBO""? A excluded.

""JIRGA""? A excluded? J,I,R,G,A? A excluded, invalid.

""LIRDO""? Not familiar.

Another: ""TERRO""? E and T excluded.

It's challenging.

Perhaps ""MORRO""? M,O,R,R,O? Duplicate O and R? But R at position 2? M0, O1, R2, R3, O4. O at position 1? But in this guess, if we put O at position 1, we know from Guess 3 that O is not at position 1? In Guess 3, WORDY had O at position 1 and it was wrong position, so O is not at position 1.

So we cannot use O at position 1.

Similarly, O cannot be at position 2.

In ""MORRO"", O is at 1 and 4. But position 1 is not allowed for O, so if we try ""MORRO"", the O at 1 would be wrong, and at 4 might be correct or wrong.

But we shouldn't put O at position 1 because we know it's not there.

So for O at position 4, the word should not have O at 1 or 2.

Similarly, for other positions.

Back to O at position 3: _ _ R O _

We can try to use common letters.

Possible words:
- The first two letters: let's say B and U: ""BURRO""? B,U,R,R,O? Duplicate R and O at 3? B0, U1, R2, R3, O4? For O at position 4? I need O at position 3.

If O is at position 3, the pattern is _ _ R O _

So after R must be O, then another letter.

So ""___RO"" but the last letter is not O, it's O at the fourth position, so the word should end with something after O.

Pattern: positions: 0:?, 1:?, 2:R, 3:O, 4:?

So it must be a letter at position 4.

For example:
- ""FROWN"" has N? Excluded.
- ""BROWN"" has N? Excluded.
- ""CROOK"" has C and K? C excluded, K is available? C excluded? C is in excluded list. And O at 3? B0,R1,O2? We need R at 2, so not.

Better: ""MICRO"" M,I,C,R,O -> C excluded.

""TROOP"" T and P excluded.

Since S,P,T are excluded, avoid.

Another: ""QUERO"" not common.

Maybe ""VEROO"" not.

Perhaps ""HIRO"" is 4 letters.

""FIORD""? But that's Fjord spelling variation? And D is excluded? No, D is in excluded? D: in Guess 3, D was marked x, so D not in word.

D is excluded.

In Guess 3, WORDY had D at position 3 and it was x, so D not present.

Similarly, Y not, W not.

So excluded: C,A,N,E,S,P,T,W,D,Y

Available: B,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,Q,R,U,V,X,Z

And O must be placed.

Now, O at position 3: word pattern: _ _ R O ?

Position 4: needs a letter, say L: ""BAROL""? Not a word.

With U: ""CURIO""? C is excluded.

""BURIO"" not valid.

""FERIO"" not common.

""HERO"" too short.

""ZERO"" Z,E,R,O -> E excluded.

J: ""JERBO"" J,E,R,B,O -> E excluded.

L: ""LORRO""? Not common.

M: ""MAROO"" not.

Perhaps ""GROOF"" not valid.

This is tough.

Maybe O at position 0 is easier.

O at 0: O _ R _ _

Position 1: must be a consonant, say G: ""OGRES""? E excluded.

""OGHAM"" G,H,A,M -> A excluded.

""OGIVE"" E? Excluded.

""OGRIS"" not common.

""OLEIC"" E? Excluded.

""OLIOS"" duplicate O? And O at 0 and 4? But we don't know.

""OPING"" O at 0, P is excluded.

""OUBIT"" U,B,I,T -> T excluded.

""OUPHE"" E and U? E excluded.

Not working.

O at position 4: _ _ R _ O

For example:
- ""BURDO"" not valid.
- ""FERMO"" E excluded.
- ""GIRZO"" not.
- ""HORMO"" H,O,R,M,O? Duplicate O? And O at 1 not allowed.
- ""JARUL"" not.

Perhaps ""VIRGO"" V,I,R,G,O. Positions: V0, I1, R2, G3, O4.

Letters: V,I,G,O. All available? Excluded? V,I,G not excluded.

And O at position 4.

Also, does not have O at position 1 or 2? Yes, position 1 is I, and O at 4.

So ""VIRGO"" is a word (astrology sign).

Check against constraints:
- R at position 2: fixed and correct.
- O at position 4: we want to test O at a new position.
- Letters: V,I,G,O,R. V,I,G new.

Also, avoids excluded letters.

So it should work.

We can test if O is at position 4.

Similarly, we want to test other possibilities? But we have only one guess.

Another option: O at position 3? But we couldn't find a good word for that.

But ""FUROR"" came to mind: F,U,R,O,R? But duplicate R? And O at position 3? In ""FUROR"": F0, U1, R2, O3, R4. Yes, O at position 3.

But duplicate R at position 4? R is already at position 2, so if the word has two R's, that might be possible.

But we don't know.

""FUROR"" has R twice, but it's allowed if the secret word has multiple R's.

But so far, we have no evidence of duplicates.

""VIRGO"" only has one R.

Both are valid.

Now, which one to choose?

""VIRGO"": tests O at position 4.
""FUROR"": tests O at position 3 and possible duplicate R.

We also have to consider the letters.

In ""VIRGO"", we test V, I, G.

In ""FUROR"", we test F, U, and see if R appears again.

Both are good.

But note, in ""FUROR"", position 4 is R, which is not the fixed R; it's an additional R. And we know R is not at position 1 or 3, but position 4 hasn't been tested for R? We haven't tried R at position 4.

But we know R is in the word at position 2, so if there is a duplicate, it could be elsewhere.

But we don't have information on duplicates.

To test specifically for O's position, it's better to try ""VIRGO"" to test O at position 4 without introducing a duplicate.

Similarly, we can test O at position 3 later if needed.

Since we have limited guesses, ""VIRGO"" might be safer.

Another word for O at position 3: ""GIROS"" but S excluded.

""BIROS"" same issue.

""LIROT"" T excluded? And L,I,R,O,T. T excluded.

 Not good.

""MUROW"" W excluded.

So ""FUROR"" is one option, but it has duplicate R.

Alternatively, ""VIRGO"" is duplicate-free.

We can choose ""VIRGO"".

Also, we haven't tested V, I, G, which are common.

So I think ""VIRGO"" is a good guess.

Therefore, fourth guess: VIRGO

Position breakdown: 
- 0: V
- 1: I
- 2: R (fixed and known to be correct, so will show as ✓)
- 3: G
- 4: O

We can predict that R will be ✓, and feedback for V, I, G, O will depend.

We hope that if O is at 4, it shows correct, or else wrong position or not.

So let's go with that.### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Current Constraints from Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
     - R is in the word but not in position 1 (0-based index: index 1).  
     - C, A, N, E are not in the word.  
   
   - **Guess 2: SPORT** → Feedback: S(x), P(x), O(-), R(-), T(x)  
     - O is in the word but not in position 2 (index 2).  
     - R is in the word but not in position 3 (index 3).  
     - S, P, T are not in the word.  
   
   - **Guess 3: WORDY** → Feedback: W(x), O(-), R(✓), D(x), Y(x)  
     - R is correct at position 2 (index 2, 0-based); the third letter is **R**. Word pattern: `_ _ R _ _ ?`.  
     - O is in the word but not in position 1 (index 1).  
     - W, D, Y are not in the word.  

2. **Key Inferences**:
   - **R Position**: Fixed at index 2 (third letter).  
     - Confirmed positions: R cannot be at index 1 (from Guess 1) or index 3 (from Guess 2), so it must be at index 2 (as now confirmed).  
   - **O Position**: Must be in the word, but not at index 1 (from WORDY feedback) or index 2 (from SPORT feedback). Remaining possible positions: index 0 (first letter), index 3 (fourth letter), or index 4 (fifth letter).  
   - **Excluded Letters**: C, A, N, E, S, P, T, W, D, Y (all marked ""x"" at least once).  
   - **Available Letters**: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, R, U, V, X, Z. R is fixed at index 2, so it cannot appear elsewhere unless duplicated (no evidence of duplicates yet). O must appear once at an untested position (0, 3, or 4).  

3. **Strategy for Guess 4**:
   - **Prioritize testing O positions**: Since O has only three possible untested positions (0, 3, 4), choose a word that tests one of these while introducing new common letters to gather more information.  
   - **Position Focus**: Testing O at index 4 (fifth letter) is efficient, as index 0 and 3 can be covered in later guesses if needed.  
   - **Letter Selection**: Use available consonants (e.g., V, I, G) that are common and untested. Avoid excluded letters and duplicates.  
   - Word pattern: `_ _ R _ O` (to test O at index 4).  

4. **Word Choice**:
   - **Candidate: ""VIRGO""** (a valid English word meaning a zodiac sign or ""virgin"").  
     - Fits pattern: `V (index 0), I (index 1), R (index 2, confirmed ✓), G (index 3), O (index 4)`.  
     - Tests O at position 4 (new).  
     - Introduces new letters V, I, G (all high-frequency, maximizing information gain).  
     - Avoids excluded letters and duplicates.  
   - **Alternatives considered**:  
     - O at index 0: Options like ""OUIJA"" or ""OAKER"" fail due to excluded letters (A, E) or invalidity.  
     - O at index 3: Words like ""FUROR"" (O at index 3) introduce duplicate R, which is risky without evidence of duplicates; ""BIROS"" or ""LIROT"" are invalid due to excluded letters (S, T).  
     - ""VIRGO"" efficiently balances position testing and new letter coverage.  

5. **Expected Feedback**:  
   - R at index 2 will show as ✓ (already confirmed).  
   - Results for V, I, G, and O will provide new info:  
     - O at index 4: If ✓, position solved; if - , O must be at index 0 or 3.  
     - V, I, G feedback will reveal if any are in the word and their positions.  

6. **Remaining Guesses**: 2 guesses left if needed (after this).

<guess>VIRGO</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SPORT -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(-) R(-) T(x)
Guess 3: WORDY -> FEEDBACK: W(x) O(-) R(✓) D(x) Y(x)
Guess 4: VIRGO -> FEEDBACK: V(x) I(x) R(✓) G(x) O(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
  - R is in the word but not in position 1 (index 1, 0-based).
  - C, A, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: SPORT -> S(x) P(x) O(-) R(-) T(x)
  - O is in the word but not in position 2 (index 2).
  - R is in the word but not in position 3 (index 3).
  - S, P, T are not in the word.

Guess 3: WORDY -> W(x) O(-) R(✓) D(x) Y(x)
  - R is correct at position 2 (index 2). So the third letter is R: _ _ R _ _
  - O is in the word but not in position 1 (index 1).
  - W, D, Y are not in the word.

Guess 4: VIRGO -> V(x) I(x) R(✓) G(x) O(-)
  - R is correct at position 2 (index 2) again, which we know.
  - O is in the word but not in position 4 (index 4).
  - V, I, G are not in the word.

Now, combining the information:

1. The word has the pattern: _ _ R _ _ (third letter is R).

2. O is in the word, but:
   - Not at position 1 (from WORDY)
   - Not at position 2 (from SPORT, and position 2 is R so it can't be anyway)
   - Not at position 4 (from VIRGO)
   - Therefore, O must be at position 3 (index 3, the fourth letter). The only remaining position is index 3.

So the word is: _ _ R O _

3. Excluded letters: C, A, N, E, S, P, T, W, D, Y, V, I, G (all marked 'x' in at least one guess).

4. Available letters: B, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, X, Z (and O and R are already placed, but we need to fill the first two and last positions).

But note: O is now placed at position 3? Let me confirm.

We have positions: 0,1,2,3,4
- Position 2: R (fixed)
- O must be in the word, and the only position left for O is 3? Because:
  - Position 0: not tested for O? But we don't know if it's at 0? 
  - From feedback: 
      - Guess 2: O not at 2
      - Guess 3: O not at 1
      - Guess 4: O not at 4
  - So the only positions left are 0 and 3? But position 0 hasn't been tested for O.

Wait, position 0 hasn't been tested? In the guesses so far, we haven't placed O at position 0.

But we know O is in the word and not at positions 1,2,4. So it must be at position 0 or 3? But position 0 is the first letter.

In the pattern _ _ R _ _, we have positions 0,1,2,3,4. Position 2 is R. O cannot be at 1,2,4. So it must be at 0 or 3.

But in the feedback from VIRGO, O was at position 4 and it was marked as wrong position (-), meaning O is in the word but not at 4. Similarly, from WORDY, O at 1 was wrong position, and from SPORT, O at 2 was wrong position.

So O must be at position 0 or 3.

But we have the pattern: _ _ R _ _

If O is at position 0, then the word is O _ R _ _

If O is at position 3, then the word is _ _ R O _

We need to determine which one.

Also, we have to fill the other positions with available letters.

But we have two possibilities for O.

Now, we have only two guesses left (if we count, we are on the fifth guess).

We need to choose a word that can test between these two cases.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has O at position 3 and tests the other letters, or one that has O at position 0.

But we also need to test the remaining letters.

Available letters: B, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, X, Z

We can try to form words for both cases.

First, if O is at position 3: pattern _ _ R O _

The first two letters and the last letter need to be filled with available letters.

Possible words:
- With common letters: e.g., ""BURRO"" but R is at 2 and 4? But we have R at 2, so if we put R at 4, it might be duplicate. Also, B and U: B0, U1, R2, O3, R4? But we don't know about duplicates. Also, U is available.

But ""BURRO"" has duplicate R and O at 3? But O at 3 is what we are testing.

But let's see if it's valid.

Another: ""FUROR"" we thought earlier, but F is available? F is available, but in ""FUROR"": F0, U1, R2, O3, R4. Duplicate R.

But we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

But we can avoid for now.

Without duplicate: we need a word that ends with a letter other than R.

For example, ""BROLO""? Not a word.

""KROON"" has O at 3? K0, R1, O2, O3, N? But N is excluded, and O at 2 is not allowed (position 2 is R, fixed).

Position 2 is R, so we cannot put O there.

Pattern: _ _ R O _ -> so position 0,1, and 4 to fill.

With available letters: B, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, X, Z

For position 4: it must be a consonant, say L: then we need a word like ? ? R O L

Examples: ""CAROL"" has C and A, excluded.

""FROWL"" has F, R, O, W, L? But W is excluded.

W is excluded from Guess 3.

""BROIL"" has B, R, O, I, L? But I is excluded from Guess 4.

I is excluded.

""GROWL"" G excluded.

Not working.

""MUROX"" not a word.

Perhaps ""HURON"" but H,U,R,O,N? N excluded.

This is difficult.

Now, if O is at position 0: pattern O _ R _ _

Then positions: 0:O, 1:?, 2:R, 3:?, 4:?

Available letters for position 1,3,4: B, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, X, Z

And O at 0.

For example, ""OURLY"" but Y excluded.

""OUBIT"" T excluded.

""OUPHE"" E excluded.

""OUNCE"" E and C excluded.

""OUNCE"" not valid.

""OORIE"" E and O duplicate? O at 0 and 1? But position 1 is O? But we know O cannot be at position 1 from Guess 3? In Guess 3, WORDY had O at 1 and it was wrong position, so O is not at position 1. So we cannot have O at position 1.

Therefore, in the pattern O _ R _ _, position 1 cannot be O, so it must be a different letter.

Similarly, position 3 and 4.

So for O at 0: O ? R ? ? with ? not O and not excluded.

Words: ""OFLRY"" not valid.

""OAKER"" A excluded.

""OCHER"" C and E excluded.

""OGRES"" E and G excluded.

""OHMIC"" H,M,I,C? I and C excluded.

""OLEIC"" E and I excluded.

""OLIOS"" duplicate O? O at 0 and 3? But position 3 O? But we don't know, but we have to avoid duplicate for now? And S excluded.

""OMBRE"" E excluded.

""ONCER"" E and C excluded.

""OORIE"" E excluded.

""OPING"" P and G excluded? P excluded, G excluded.

""ORLOP"" O at 0 and 3? Duplicate O? And P excluded.

""OUPED"" E and D excluded.

""OUTBY"" T and Y excluded.

""OUZEL"" E and Z? Z available, but E excluded.

""OVULE"" E and V excluded.

None seem to work.

Perhaps we missed a word.

Another idea: maybe the word has duplicate letters? For example, if O is at both 0 and 3? But we don't know.

But let's list all possible words that fit the pattern and use available letters.

Pattern: _ _ R _ _

With O in the word at either position 0 or 3.

And available letters: B, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, X, Z

Also, the word must contain O.

So for O at position 0: O _ R _ _

Then the word must have O at 0, then a letter from available at 1, then R at 2, then a letter at 3 and 4 from available.

And the letter at 1,3,4 cannot be excluded.

Possible letters for position 1: B,F,H,J,K,L,M,Q,U,X,Z

Position 3 and 4: same.

And the word must be valid.

For example:
- ""OUBER"" not valid.
- ""OULRY"" not.
- ""OUMAS"" not common.
- ""OURIE"" not valid.

""OUNCE"" not.

Perhaps ""OFLRY"" not.

Maybe ""OAKER"" not.

This is not working.

For O at position 3: _ _ R O _

Then positions 0,1,4 to fill with available letters.

For example:
- ""BUROO"" not valid.
- ""FUROL"" not.
- ""HUROS"" S excluded.
- ""JUROK"" not.
- ""KUROO"" not.
- ""MUROX"" not.
- ""QUORO"" not.

""FUROR"" is a valid word: F0, U1, R2, O3, R4.

Letters: F, U, R, O, R. R is duplicated, but R is already fixed at position 2, so if the word has another R at 4, it's possible.

And F and U are available.

Also, O is at position 3.

So ""FUROR"" is a candidate.

Another possibility: ""BURRO"" B0, U1, R2, O3, R4. Also valid.

""BURRO"" is a word.

Both have duplicate R.

But we don't have evidence against duplicates.

Another word: ""MURO"" is 4 letters.

""KROON"" has O at 3? K0, R1, O2, O3, N4? But position 2 is O? But we have R fixed at position 2, so cannot. And N excluded.

Not.

""LORDO"" L,O,R,D,O? D excluded and duplicate O.

Not.

So the only common words seem to be ""FUROR"" and ""BURRO"", both with duplicate R.

We can choose one.

But let's see the feedback we would get.

If we guess ""FUROR"", what would the feedback be?

Position 0: F
Position 1: U
Position 2: R (correct, ✓)
Position 3: O
Position 4: R

Now, we know R is at position 2, so that will be ✓.

O is at position 3. If the secret word has O at position 3, it will be ✓. If not, it might be - or x, but we think it should be at 3.

But we are not sure if O is at 0 or 3.

In ""FUROR"", if the secret word has O at position 0, then O at position 3 would be marked as - if it's in the word but wrong position, or x if not, but since O is in the word, it would be -.

But we also have R at position 4. If the secret word has only one R, then R at position 4 would be marked as x or -? If there is no duplicate, then R at 4 is not present, so x. But if there is duplicate, it might be - or ✓ if position 4 is R.

But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has O at position 3 and a different letter at position 4, but we couldn't find one.

Another idea: what if we test O at position 0 with a word that has O at 0 and uses common letters.

For example, ""OUBIT"" is not valid.

""OUNCE"" not.

""OULAK"" not.

Perhaps ""OUJDA"" not.

Maybe ""OKRUG"" not common.

I think we have to go with ""FUROR"" or ""BURRO"".

Let's choose ""FUROR"" as it is a valid word.

But we have to consider that if O is at position 0, then ""FUROR"" would have O at 3 which is wrong position, and we might not solve.

But we have two guesses left, so we can recover.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that has O at position 3 and also tests other letters, and if it's not, then O must be at 0.

But we have to find such a word.

Since we have only two positions for O (0 or 3), we can guess a word with O at 3 and see.

If it's not, then O is at 0.

So for guess 5, we can guess a word with O at position 3.

""FUROR"" is one.

But let's see if there is a word without duplicate.

For example, ""BUOYS"" S excluded.

""CLOYS"" C and S excluded.

""JOYED"" D and Y excluded.

""LOYAL"" A and L? L is available, but A excluded.

""MOYLS"" not valid.

""NOYAU"" A and U? A excluded.

""QUOIF"" Q,U,O,I,F? I excluded.

Not working.

""SULCI"" S excluded.

So ""FUROR"" or ""BURRO"" are the options.

I'll go with ""FUROR"".

So guess: FUROR

But let's see the feedback we got so far.

Another thought: in Guess 4, VIRGO had O at 4 and it was marked as - , meaning O is in the word but not at 4. So if we put O at 3 in ""FUROR"", it might be correct.

Similarly, if we put O at 0 in a guess, it might be correct.

But we don't have a good word for O at 0.

So for now, ""FUROR"" is a reasonable guess.

So fifth guess: FUROR

But let's format it.### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Current Constraints from Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
     - R is in the word but not at position 1 (index 1, 0-based).  
     - C, A, N, E are excluded.  
   
   - **Guess 2: SPORT** → Feedback: S(x), P(x), O(-), R(-), T(x)  
     - O is in the word but not at position 2 (index 2).  
     - R is in the word but not at position 3 (index 3).  
     - S, P, T are excluded.  
   
   - **Guess 3: WORDY** → Feedback: W(x), O(-), R(✓), D(x), Y(x)  
     - R is correct at position 2 (index 2); word pattern: `_ _ R _ _`.  
     - O is in the word but not at position 1 (index 1).  
     - W, D, Y are excluded.  
   
   - **Guess 4: VIRGO** → Feedback: V(x), I(x), R(✓), G(x), O(-)  
     - R is correct at position 2 (index 2), confirming the pattern `_ _ R _ _`.  
     - O is in the word but not at position 4 (index 4).  
     - V, I, G are excluded.  

2. **Key Inferences**:
   - **Fixed Position**: R is locked at index 2 (third letter).  
   - **O Position**: O must be in the word but cannot be at positions 1, 2, or 4 (from feedback). The only remaining positions are index 0 (first letter) or index 3 (fourth letter).  
   - **Excluded Letters**: C, A, N, E, S, P, T, W, D, Y, V, I, G (all marked ""x"" at least once).  
   - **Available Letters**: B, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, X, Z (must be used for positions 0, 1, and 4).  
   - **Word Pattern**: `_ _ R _ _` with O at index 0 or 3.  

3. **Strategy for Guess 5**:
   - **Test O at Position 3**: Since O cannot be at positions 1, 2, or 4, position 3 (fourth letter) is a high-probability candidate. Testing this efficiently narrows down O's location.  
   - **Cover New Letters**: Use available consonants (e.g., F, U, R) to maximize information. R is fixed at index 2, but duplicates are possible (no evidence against them yet).  
   - **Word Choice**: ""FUROR"" fits:  
     - Positions: F (index 0), U (index 1), R (index 2, ✓), O (index 3), R (index 4).  
     - Tests O at index 3 (critical for solving position).  
     - Tests F and U (new letters) and checks for R duplication at index 4.  
     - Valid English word (meaning ""a general commotion or uproar"").  

4. **Expected Outcomes**:
   - If O is at index 3, it will show as ✓ or - (confirming position).  
   - Feedback on F, U, and the second R (index 4) will reveal if they are in the word and their positions.  
   - If O is not at index 3, it must be at index 0, and we can adjust the final guess accordingly.

Also, it does not contain C, A, N, E.\n\nWe have 6 tries and this was the first guess. Now we need to make a second guess.\n\nWe should choose a word that:\n- Includes R (since we know it\'s in the word) and places it in a different position than the second (because in the first guess it was in the second and was wrong).\n- Avoids the letters C, A, N, E (since they are not in the word).\n- Uses other common letters to maximize the chance of getting more information.\n\nPossible positions for R: since it\'s not in position 2, it could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\nWe also know the word is 5 letters and must be a valid English word.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have R in one of the positions 1, 3, 4, 5 and avoid C, A, N, E.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, etc.\n\nA good second guess might be a word that has R and several of these new letters.\n\nFor example, let\'s consider words starting with S or T, as they are common.\n\nWe can try to put R in the first position? But note: we don\'t know if R is in the first position or not. We only know it\'s not in the second.\n\nBut we can try a word that has R in a different position.\n\nLet me list some words that have R and avoid C, A, N, E.\n\nExample: ""ROUST"" - but that has U and O, which we haven\'t tested. But let\'s see.\n\nAlternatively, ""TRIES"" - but that has E, which we know is not in the word. So we must avoid E.\n\nWe must avoid E because it was marked as not present.\n\nSo, we need a word without C, A, N, E.\n\nLet me think of words with R and without these letters.\n\nCommon words: \n- ""SPORT"": has S, P, O, R, T. R is at position 4. But we don\'t know if O is in the word or not.\n- ""STORM"": has S, T, O, R, M. R is at position 4. Also, we avoid C, A, N, E.\n\nBut note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have any indication of duplicates yet.\n\nAnother idea: ""DRUID"" - but D is a new letter, but we have to avoid A and E? ""DRUID"" has D, R, U, I, D? Wait, duplicate D? Also, it has U and I which are new.\n\nBut we know R is in the word, so we can try to use it.\n\nBut perhaps we can choose a word that has R and many common consonants and vowels that we haven\'t tried.\n\nVowels we haven\'t tried: O, I, U (and sometimes Y, but let\'s avoid Y for now).\n\nWe know the word must have at least one R, and we have 5 positions to fill without C, A, N, E.\n\nLet me try to come up with a word that has R and uses common letters.\n\nOne classic word is ""ROUND"", but that has O, U, N, D. But N is not allowed (we know N is not in the word). So we cannot use N.\n\nSo avoid N.\n\nAnother: ""PROUD"" - has P, R, O, U, D. R is at position 2? But wait, in our first guess, R was at position 2 and it was marked as wrong position. So if we put R at position 2 again, it would still be wrong? But we don\'t know if the secret word has R at position 2 or not? Actually, the feedback for the first guess said R is in the word but not at position 2. So if we put R at position 2 again, it would still be marked as wrong position (if the correct position is not 2) or correct if it is? But we know it\'s not at position 2? Actually, the feedback only tells us that in the first guess, R was not at the correct position. But it might be that the secret word has R at position 2? No, because if it were at position 2, it would have been marked as correct (✓). But it was marked as wrong position (-), meaning R is in the word but not at position 2. Therefore, position 2 is definitely not the correct position for R.\n\nSo if we put R at position 2 again, it would still be marked as wrong position (unless the secret word has two R\'s and one of them is at position 2? But we don\'t know about duplicates). However, to avoid confusion, it might be better to put R in a different position to test a new spot.\n\nBut we don\'t have to avoid position 2 for R? Actually, we know that position 2 is not correct for R, so if we put R at position 2 again, we will get the same feedback (wrong position) and we don\'t gain new information about the position. So it\'s better to try R in a new position.\n\nTherefore, for the second guess, we should put R in one of the positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\nLet me try to form a word without C, A, N, E and with R in a new position.\n\nFor example, position 1: R at the start.\n\nWords: ""ROAST"" - but has A, which is not allowed. Avoid A.\n\n""ROOST"" - has O, O, S, T. But O is repeated? And we don\'t know about O. Also, it has O and S, T.\n\nBut we avoid A, but O is new.\n\n""ROOTS"" - similar.\n\nBut we can use ""ROILS"" or ""ROUPS"" but not common.\n\nAnother: ""RISKY"" - has R at position 1, I, S, K, Y. Avoids C, A, N, E. But Y is less common.\n\nAlternatively, position 3: for example, ""BORED"" - but has E, which is not allowed.\n\n""FORTS"" - has F, O, R, T, S. R is at position 3. Avoids C, A, N, E.\n\n""PORTS"" - similar.\n\nPosition 4: ""SPORT"", as I thought earlier.\n\nPosition 5: ""LATER"" - but has A and E, not allowed.\n\n""RUMOR"" - has U, M, O, R. R at the end? But also R at the beginning? Duplicate R.\n\nWe don\'t know if duplicates are allowed, but we can avoid for now.\n\nAfter considering, I think ""SPORT"" is a good candidate:\n- S, P, O, R, T\n- R is at position 4 (a new position, not 2)\n- Avoids C, A, N, E\n- Uses common letters: S, P, O, T\n\nAnother candidate: ""STORM"" - similar, with R at position 4 and M instead of P.\n\nBut we might get more information with ""SPORT"" or ""STORM"".\n\nAlternatively, ""TRIPS"" - has T, R, I, P, S. R at position 2? But we don\'t want to put R at position 2 again because we know it\'s not correct and we won\'t get new position info.\n\nIn ""TRIPS"", R is at position 2. We know position 2 is not correct for R, so we would get the same feedback for R (wrong position) and we don\'t learn a new position. So it\'s better to avoid position 2 for R in this guess.\n\nTherefore, let\'s avoid words with R at position 2.\n\nSo, ""SPORT"" has R at position 4.\n\nSimilarly, ""DRIPS"" has R at position 3? D, R, I, P, S. But we don\'t know about D.\n\nBut ""DRIPS"" has R at position 2? No: D is position 1, R is position 2. So that\'s position 2 again. We don\'t want that.\n\nHow about ""GRIPS""? G is new, but R is at position 2 again.\n\nWe want R not at position 2.\n\nSo let\'s look for words with R at 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\nAnother word: ""PURSE"" - but has E, not allowed.\n\n""BIRDS"" - has B, I, R, D, S. R is at position 3. Avoids C, A, N, E.\n\nBut B is new.\n\n""FIRST"" - F, I, R, S, T. R at position 3. Avoids C, A, N, E.\n\nSimilarly, ""THIRD"" - T, H, I, R, D. R at position 4.\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nI think ""FIRST"" is a good choice because it has common letters: F, I, S, T and R at position 3.\n\nBut F is not the most common, but it\'s okay.\n\nAlternatively, ""SPORT"" is also good.\n\nTo maximize vowel information, we can include a vowel we haven\'t tried. We haven\'t tried O, I, U.\n\nIn ""SPORT"", we have O. In ""FIRST"", we have I.\n\nBoth are good.\n\nI\'ll go with ""SPORT"" because it has O, which is a common vowel, and we get to test S, P, O, T as well.\n\nSo, second guess: ""SPORT""\n\nWe hope to get feedback on these letters.\n\nIf we get a correct position for R, that would be great. But if not, we\'ll know more.\n\nSo, let\'s choose ""SPORT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- C, A, N, E are not in the secret word (marked as ""x"").\n- R is in the word but not in the second position (marked as ""-"").\n\nFor the second guess, I need to:\n- Include R (since it\'s in the secret word) but avoid placing it in the second position again to test a new location.\n- Exclude C, A, N, E entirely.\n- Use other common letters to maximize information gain (e.g., S, T, O, P).\n\nI chose ""SPORT"" because:\n- It places R in the fourth position (a new location to test).\n- It avoids C, A, N, E and introduces new common letters: S, P, O, T.\n- This combination helps test for vowels (O) and frequent consonants, providing broad coverage.\n\n<guess>SPORT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: SPORT -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(-) R(-) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two guesses and their feedback:\n\nGuess 1: CRANE\n- C: x (not in word)\n- R: - (in word, wrong position)\n- A: x (not in word)\n- N: x (not in word)\n- E: x (not in word)\n\nFrom this, we know:\n- The secret word contains the letter R, but not in the second position (index 1, if we index from 0).\n- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the word.\n\nGuess 2: SPORT\n- S: x (not in word)\n- P: x (not in word)\n- O: - (in word, wrong position)\n- R: - (in word, wrong position)\n- T: x (not in word)\n\nFrom this, we know:\n- The secret word contains O and R, but not in the positions they were guessed (O was in position 2, R was in position 3).\n- The letters S, P, T are not in the word.\n\nCombining the information:\n- Letters not in the word: C, A, N, E, S, P, T\n- Letters in the word: R and O (and we know they are not in positions 1 and 3 for R? Let\'s clarify positions).\n\nPosition indices (0-indexed for clarity):\n- CRANE: positions 0:C, 1:R, 2:A, 3:N, 4:E\n- SPORT: positions 0:S, 1:P, 2:O, 3:R, 4:T\n\nFrom CRANE: R is in the word but not at position 1.\nFrom SPORT: R is in the word but not at position 3, and O is in the word but not at position 2.\n\nSo R is in the word, but not at index 1 or 3. Therefore, R must be at one of the positions: 0, 2, or 4? But wait, we have 5 positions: 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nBut note: in CRANE, R was at position 1 (which is the second letter) and we know it\'s not there. In SPORT, R was at position 3 (the fourth letter) and it\'s not there. So R cannot be at position 1 or 3. Therefore, R must be at position 0, 2, or 4.\n\nSimilarly, O is in the word but not at position 2 (from SPORT). So O must be at position 0, 1, 3, or 4? But we have to consider the constraints.\n\nAlso, we know the following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, E, S, P, T.\n\nSo the secret word must contain R and O, and three other letters that are not in the excluded set.\n\nWe have 6 tries, and we are on the third guess.\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that:\n- Includes R and O (both must appear, but not at the positions we\'ve already tried for them)\n- Excludes C, A, N, E, S, P, T\n- Tries to place R in one of the positions 0, 2, or 4 (since it can\'t be at 1 or 3)\n- Tries to place O in a position that is not 2 (so 0,1,3,4) but note that if we place O at a position, we have to avoid the positions we know are wrong for R? They are independent.\n\nBut also, we want to test new letters to get more information.\n\nWhat letters are left? We have the alphabet minus the excluded ones.\n\nExcluded: C, A, N, E, S, P, T\n\nSo available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nBut note: O and R are already known to be in the word, so we need to include them.\n\nWe also want to use common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.\n\nCommon letters: among the available, we have B, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, U, etc.\n\nWe need to form a word that has R and O, and three other letters from the available set.\n\nMoreover, we have constraints on the positions for R and O.\n\nLet me think of words that have R and O, without the excluded letters.\n\nFor example, words like:\n- FLOUR: but has F, L, O, U, R. But we have to check positions. Also, we don\'t know about F, L, U.\n- BROIL: B, R, O, I, L. This might work.\n\nBut we need to assign positions.\n\nWe know R cannot be at position 1 or 3. So in the word we guess, we should avoid putting R at 1 or 3.\n\nSimilarly, O cannot be at position 2.\n\nSo for the next guess, we can try to put R at position 0 (the first letter) and O at position 4 (the last), for example, to test new positions.\n\nBut we have to form a valid word.\n\nLet me list possible words:\n\nOption 1: R at position 0, O at position 1? But position 1: we know from CRANE that R was at position 1 and it was wrong, but that doesn\'t say anything about O. However, we have to avoid putting R at 1, but O can be at 1.\n\nBut we don\'t have a constraint that O cannot be at 1. Only that it cannot be at 2.\n\nSo possible:\n\n- R at 0, O at 1: e.g., ""ROBOT"" but has B and T? T is excluded. So not.\n\n""ROBOT"" has T, which is excluded.\n\n""ROOMY"" has O repeated and Y, but we don\'t know about Y. Also, O repeated? We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed, but we can avoid for now.\n\n""ROWDY"": R, O, W, D, Y. Avoids excluded letters? W, D, Y are not excluded. So ""ROWDY"" is a candidate.\n\nPositions: R at 0, O at 1, W at 2, D at 3, Y at 4.\n\nBut we have to check the constraints for R and O:\n- R is at 0: which is allowed (not 1 or 3).\n- O is at 1: which is allowed (only constraint is not at 2).\n\nSo that\'s okay.\n\nBut we are testing O at position 1 and R at position 0.\n\nAnother option: put R at position 2 and O at position 4.\n\nFor example, ""BROOD"" has O repeated and D, but B is allowed? ""BROOD"": B, R, O, O, D. But duplicate O? And we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, O is at position 2? But we know O cannot be at position 2 (from SPORT feedback). So if we put O at position 2, it would be wrong, but we already know that. So it\'s a waste of a position. We should avoid putting O at position 2.\n\nSimilarly, we should avoid putting R at positions 1 and 3.\n\nSo in our next guess, we should avoid:\n- R at positions 1 and 3\n- O at position 2\n\nNow, back to ""ROWDY"": it uses R at 0, O at 1, and new letters W, D, Y.\n\nBut we don\'t know if W, D, Y are in the word. It\'s a good way to test them.\n\nAnother word: ""ROGUE"" but E is excluded.\n\n""ROBIN"": R, O, B, I, N. But N is excluded (from CRANE: N is not in the word). So invalid.\n\n""ROOMY"": O repeated and we don\'t know about duplicates. Also, Y is at the end.\n\nBut let\'s avoid duplicates for now.\n\n""ROWDY"" seems acceptable.\n\nAnother word: ""FROWN"": F, R, O, W, N. But N is excluded.\n\n""GROWL"": G, R, O, W, L. This avoids excluded letters. Positions: R at 1? Position 1 is the second letter. But we cannot put R at position 1 because we know it\'s not the correct position for R. In ""GROWL"", R is at position 1 (if we break down: G0, R1, O2, W3, L4). But we cannot put R at 1 because we know it\'s not there. Also, O is at position 2, which we know is not correct for O. So we would get - for both, but we already know that. So it doesn\'t give new position information.\n\nWe want to test new positions for R and O.\n\nSo we should try to put R at a position we haven\'t tried: 0, 2, or 4 (since 1 and 3 are tried and wrong).\n\nSimilarly for O, we haven\'t tried positions 0,1,3,4 (only 2 is tried and wrong).\n\nSo ideally, we put R at 0, 2, or 4 and O at 0,1,3,4 (but not 2) and in a way that they are in new positions.\n\nAlso, we want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nAnother word: ""DOZER"" but E is excluded and R is at the end? ""DOZER"" has E and R at the end. But E is excluded.\n\n""RUMOR"": has U, M, O, R. But duplicate R? And positions: R at 0 and 4? We don\'t know about duplicates. Also, O at position 3? That might be okay.\n\nBut let\'s avoid duplicates.\n\n""ROBOT"" is out because of T.\n\n""ROBIN"" is out because of N.\n\n""ROUGE"" has E.\n\n""ROWDY"" is a valid word and uses W, D, Y which are not tested.\n\nAnother option: ""ROYAL"" but A is excluded.\n\n""ROUND"" has N and D? N is excluded.\n\n""FROST"" has S and T, excluded.\n\n""CRONY"" has C and N, excluded.\n\nSo ""ROWDY"" seems a good candidate.\n\nBut let me think of another: ""GROUT"" has T, excluded.\n\n""BROWN"" has N, excluded.\n\n""GROWL"" has R at position 1, which we cannot use.\n\nWhat about ""MOURN""? Has U, but N is excluded.\n\n""DOUGH"" has D, O, U, G, H. But no R? We must include R because we know R is in the word. So we have to include R.\n\nSo the word must contain R and O.\n\nAnother word: ""FJORD"" has F, J, O, R, D. Avoids excluded letters. Positions: F0, J1, O2, R3, D4.\n\nBut O is at position 2: we know O cannot be at position 2 (from SPORT feedback). So if we use this, O at 2 would be marked as wrong position, which we already know. So it doesn\'t help.\n\nSimilarly, R is at position 3: we know R cannot be at position 3 (from SPORT feedback). So again, we get no new position information for R and O.\n\nWe want to avoid that.\n\nSo we need a word where:\n- R is at 0, 2, or 4 (new positions to test)\n- O is at 0,1,3, or 4 (but not 2)\n\nAnd the word must be valid.\n\n""ROWDY"": R at 0, O at 1, W at 2, D at 3, Y at 4. This satisfies:\n- R at 0: new position\n- O at 1: new position (we haven\'t tried O at 1 before)\n\nWe haven\'t tried O at position 1, so it\'s a good test.\n\nSimilarly, we test W, D, Y.\n\nAnother possibility: ""ROBED"" but E is excluded.\n\n""RULED"" has E and L, U, D. E excluded.\n\n""RIFLE"" has E and F, L. E excluded.\n\n""RHYME"" has E, H, Y, M. E excluded.\n\n""ROBOT"" excluded.\n\n""ROWDY"" seems one of the few options.\n\n""ROWED"" has E, excluded.\n\n""ROWDY"" is valid.\n\nAnother word: ""ROYAL"" has A, excluded.\n\n""ROBES"" has E and S, excluded.\n\nSo I think ""ROWDY"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me confirm the letters: R, O, W, D, Y. None of these are excluded (excluded are C,A,N,E,S,P,T).\n\nSo yes.\n\nWe can also consider ""DOLLY"" but no R.\n\nMust have R.\n\n""WORDY"": W, O, R, D, Y. This is also a word.\n\nPositions: W0, O1, R2, D3, Y4.\n\nNow, check constraints:\n- R is at position 2: which is a new position (we haven\'t tried R at 2 before). We tried R at 1 and 3, so 2 is new.\n- O is at position 1: which is new (we only tried O at 2 before, which was wrong).\n\nSo ""WORDY"" also satisfies.\n\nNow, between ""ROWDY"" and ""WORDY"", which one to choose?\n\n""ROWDY"": R at 0, O at 1\n""WORDY"": W at 0, O at 1, R at 2\n\nBoth test O at 1 and R at a new position (0 or 2).\n\nBut ""WORDY"" has R at 2, which is the middle, and we haven\'t tested that. Also, in ""ROWDY"", R is at 0, which is the first letter.\n\nWe don\'t have a strong preference, but note that in ""WORDY"", we are testing W at 0 and D at 3, Y at 4, same as ""ROWDY"" but with different arrangement.\n\nBut ""WORDY"" might be less common? But it\'s a valid word.\n\nAnother point: we know that in the secret word, R cannot be at 1 or 3, so position 2 is a possibility. Similarly, position 0 and 4.\n\nI think both are acceptable.\n\nBut let\'s see the commonality. ""ROWDY"" is more common than ""WORDY""? Not sure.\n\nWe can choose ""WORDY"" to test R in the middle.\n\nBut I recall that in Wordle, common words are better, but both are valid.\n\nTo break the tie, note that in ""ROWDY"", we have R at 0 and O at 1, which are adjacent. In ""WORDY"", O and R are adjacent at positions 1 and 2. But that might not matter.\n\nAnother word: ""DOZER"" excluded.\n\n""FJORD"" has O at 2, which we cannot use.\n\nI think ""WORDY"" is fine.\n\nBut let me check: ""WORDY"" is an adjective meaning using too many words, so it\'s valid.\n\nSimilarly, ""ROWDY"" is also valid.\n\nI\'ll go with ""WORDY"" because it tests R at position 2, which we haven\'t tried, and O at position 1.\n\nSo guess: ""WORDY""\n\nBut let\'s write it in uppercase: ""WORDY""\n\nNow, to summarize:\n\nWe are guessing ""WORDY"" to test:\n- R at position 2 (new position)\n- O at position 1 (new position)\n- And letters W, D, Y which are new.\n\nWe hope to get feedback that might confirm positions for R and O or reveal new letters.\n\nIf we get a correct for R or O, that would be great.\n\nBut even if not, we\'ll know more about the positions.\n\nSo, third guess: WORDYBased on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)  \n  - R is in the word but not in position 1 (second letter).  \n  - C, A, N, E are not in the word.  \n\n- **Guess 2: SPORT** → Feedback: S(x), P(x), O(-), R(-), T(x)  \n  - O is in the word but not in position 2 (third letter).  \n  - R is in the word but not in position 3 (fourth letter).  \n  - S, P, T are not in the word.  \n\n### Key Insights:\n- **Confirmed in the word**: R and O must appear, but with position constraints:  \n  - R cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (index 1 or 3, 0-indexed).  \n  - O cannot be in position 2 (index 2).  \n- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, E, S, P, T (cannot appear in the word).  \n- **Remaining positions for R**: 0, 2, or 4 (first, third, or fifth letter).  \n- **Remaining positions for O**: 0, 1, 3, or 4 (first, second, fourth, or fifth letter).  \n- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding the 7 known absent letters).  \n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- Test R in a new position (not 1 or 3) and O in a new position (not 2) to gather more positional information.  \n- Prioritize positions:  \n  - Place R at position 2 (index 2) to test the center, as it hasn\'t been tried yet.  \n  - Place O at position 1 (index 1) to test the second letter position, which is new for O.  \n- Include new high-frequency letters (e.g., W, D, Y) to maximize information gain.  \n- Avoid excluded letters and duplicate letters (since no duplicates have been indicated yet).  \n\nThe word **""WORDY""** fits these criteria:  \n- W (position 0), O (position 1), R (position 2), D (position 3), Y (position 4).  \n- Tests R at position 2 (new) and O at position 1 (new).  \n- Introduces W, D, and Y as new letters.  \n- Valid English word (adjective, meaning ""using too many words"").  \n\nThis guess will help narrow down the positions of R and O and reveal if any of W, D, or Y are in the word.\n\n<guess>WORDY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: SPORT -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(-) R(-) T(x)\nGuess 3: WORDY -> FEEDBACK: W(x) O(-) R(✓) D(x) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the previous feedback:\n\nGuess 1: CRANE -> Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\n- R is in the word but not in position 1 (index 1, 0-based).\n\nGuess 2: SPORT -> Feedback: S(x) P(x) O(-) R(-) T(x)\n- O is in the word but not in position 2 (index 2).\n- R is in the word but not in position 3 (index 3).\n\nGuess 3: WORDY -> Feedback: W(x) O(-) R(✓) D(x) Y(x)\n- R is in the correct position!

But R is fixed at position 2, and O must appear once (no duplicates indicated, so we assume single for now).\n\nWe need to form a word with O at position 0, 3, or 4.\n\nPossible options:\n\n1. O at position 0: O _ R _ _\n2. O at position 3: _ _ R O _\n3. O at position 4: _ _ R _ O\n\nWe need to use the available letters and form valid words.\n\nWe also have two more guesses so far (this will be fourth guess).\n\nWe want to test possible positions for O and also test more letters.\n\nSince O has three possible positions (0,3,4), we might need to choose a word that tests O at one of these and also tests other common letters.\n\nFirst, consider O at position 0: O _ R _ _\n\nThe second letter must be from available set. Similarly, last two letters.\n\nWords: e.g., ""OGRER"" but duplicate R? And G, E? E is excluded. Duplicate R might be issue, but we don\'t know.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""OUIJA"" has U, I, J, A? A excluded. Invalid.\n- ""OLLER"" has L, but E? Excluded. Also, duplicate L? Not good.\n\nBetter: ""OILER""? But E excluded.\n\n""OAKER""? A and E issues.\n\nIt\'s hard without vowels. We have U and I available.\n\nAnother word: ""ORDER"" has E and R duplicate? E excluded.\n\n""OUMAS""? Not common.\n\nPerhaps O at position 0 is hard with the constraints.\n\nNow, try O at position 3: _ _ R O _\n\nFirst two letters: available letters, last letter: available.\n\nFor example:\n- _ _ R O _\nPossible: ""MIRRO"" not a word.\n- ""FUROR"" has F, U, R, O, R? Duplicate R? And positions: F0, U1, R2, O3, R4. Duplicate R and R at position 2 (fixed) and 4? But R is fixed at 2, so having another R might be possible? We don\'t know. But ""FUROR"" has A? No, F,U,R,O,R. But duplicate R. And the word ends with R.\n\nBut D and Y are out, but R is allowed? Duplicates may be possible but we haven\'t seen one yet.\n\nBut ""FUROR"" is a word? Fury is, but furor? Yes, it\'s valid.\n\nLetters: F, U, R, O; with duplicate R? In ""FUROR"", it\'s F-U-R-O-R, so it has R at position 2 and 4. But we know position 2 is R, so if there is another R, it might be at 4.\n\nBut we have O at position 3.\n\nHowever, the word must be checked against excluded letters: F,U,R,O,R. R is allowed, but F,U,O are new. Excluded letters don\'t include these.\n\nBut we also have the constraint that O must not be at position 2 (which it isn\'t, it\'s at 3) and R is at 2, correct.\n\nBut duplicate R: we don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters, but it\'s possible.\n\nAnother word without duplicate: ""BIROS""? B,I,R,O,S? S excluded.\n\n""GIRO"" is 4 letters.\n\n""HERO"" is 4.\n\n""KIRO"" not common.\n\n""MURO"" not common.\n\n""VIRO"" not common.\n\nPerhaps ""FUROR"" is an option.\n\nNow, O at position 4: _ _ R _ O\n\nFirst two and the fourth letter.\n\nE.g., ""BERMO""? E excluded.\n\n""GARBO""? A excluded.\n\n""JIRGA""? A excluded? J,I,R,G,A? A excluded, invalid.\n\n""LIRDO""? Not familiar.\n\nAnother: ""TERRO""? E and T excluded.\n\nIt\'s challenging.\n\nPerhaps ""MORRO""? M,O,R,R,O? Duplicate O and R? But R at position 2? M0, O1, R2, R3, O4. O at position 1? But in this guess, if we put O at position 1, we know from Guess 3 that O is not at position 1? In Guess 3, WORDY had O at position 1 and it was wrong position, so O is not at position 1.\n\nSo we cannot use O at position 1.\n\nSimilarly, O cannot be at position 2.\n\nIn ""MORRO"", O is at 1 and 4. But position 1 is not allowed for O, so if we try ""MORRO"", the O at 1 would be wrong, and at 4 might be correct or wrong.\n\nBut we shouldn\'t put O at position 1 because we know it\'s not there.\n\nSo for O at position 4, the word should not have O at 1 or 2.\n\nSimilarly, for other positions.\n\nBack to O at position 3: _ _ R O _\n\nWe can try to use common letters.\n\nPossible words:\n- The first two letters: let\'s say B and U: ""BURRO""? B,U,R,R,O? Duplicate R and O at 3? B0, U1, R2, R3, O4? For O at position 4? I need O at position 3.\n\nIf O is at position 3, the pattern is _ _ R O _\n\nSo after R must be O, then another letter.\n\nSo ""___RO"" but the last letter is not O, it\'s O at the fourth position, so the word should end with something after O.\n\nPattern: positions: 0:?, 1:?, 2:R, 3:O, 4:?\n\nSo it must be a letter at position 4.\n\nFor example:\n- ""FROWN"" has N? Excluded.\n- ""BROWN"" has N? Excluded.\n- ""CROOK"" has C and K? C excluded, K is available? C excluded? C is in excluded list. And O at 3? B0,R1,O2? We need R at 2, so not.\n\nBetter: ""MICRO"" M,I,C,R,O -> C excluded.\n\n""TROOP"" T and P excluded.\n\nSince S,P,T are excluded, avoid.\n\nAnother: ""QUERO"" not common.\n\nMaybe ""VEROO"" not.\n\nPerhaps ""HIRO"" is 4 letters.\n\n""FIORD""? But that\'s Fjord spelling variation? And D is excluded? No, D is in excluded? D: in Guess 3, D was marked x, so D not in word.\n\nD is excluded.\n\nIn Guess 3, WORDY had D at position 3 and it was x, so D not present.\n\nSimilarly, Y not, W not.\n\nSo excluded: C,A,N,E,S,P,T,W,D,Y\n\nAvailable: B,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,Q,R,U,V,X,Z\n\nAnd O must be placed.\n\nNow, O at position 3: word pattern: _ _ R O ?\n\nPosition 4: needs a letter, say L: ""BAROL""? Not a word.\n\nWith U: ""CURIO""? C is excluded.\n\n""BURIO"" not valid.\n\n""FERIO"" not common.\n\n""HERO"" too short.\n\n""ZERO"" Z,E,R,O -> E excluded.\n\nJ: ""JERBO"" J,E,R,B,O -> E excluded.\n\nL: ""LORRO""? Not common.\n\nM: ""MAROO"" not.\n\nPerhaps ""GROOF"" not valid.\n\nThis is tough.\n\nMaybe O at position 0 is easier.\n\nO at 0: O _ R _ _\n\nPosition 1: must be a consonant, say G: ""OGRES""? E excluded.\n\n""OGHAM"" G,H,A,M -> A excluded.\n\n""OGIVE"" E? Excluded.\n\n""OGRIS"" not common.\n\n""OLEIC"" E? Excluded.\n\n""OLIOS"" duplicate O? And O at 0 and 4? But we don\'t know.\n\n""OPING"" O at 0, P is excluded.\n\n""OUBIT"" U,B,I,T -> T excluded.\n\n""OUPHE"" E and U? E excluded.\n\nNot working.\n\nO at position 4: _ _ R _ O\n\nFor example:\n- ""BURDO"" not valid.\n- ""FERMO"" E excluded.\n- ""GIRZO"" not.\n- ""HORMO"" H,O,R,M,O? Duplicate O? And O at 1 not allowed.\n- ""JARUL"" not.\n\nPerhaps ""VIRGO"" V,I,R,G,O. Positions: V0, I1, R2, G3, O4.\n\nLetters: V,I,G,O. All available? Excluded? V,I,G not excluded.\n\nAnd O at position 4.\n\nAlso, does not have O at position 1 or 2? Yes, position 1 is I, and O at 4.\n\nSo ""VIRGO"" is a word (astrology sign).\n\nCheck against constraints:\n- R at position 2: fixed and correct.\n- O at position 4: we want to test O at a new position.\n- Letters: V,I,G,O,R. V,I,G new.\n\nAlso, avoids excluded letters.\n\nSo it should work.\n\nWe can test if O is at position 4.\n\nSimilarly, we want to test other possibilities? But we have only one guess.\n\nAnother option: O at position 3? But we couldn\'t find a good word for that.\n\nBut ""FUROR"" came to mind: F,U,R,O,R? But duplicate R? And O at position 3? In ""FUROR"": F0, U1, R2, O3, R4. Yes, O at position 3.\n\nBut duplicate R at position 4? R is already at position 2, so if the word has two R\'s, that might be possible.\n\nBut we don\'t know.\n\n""FUROR"" has R twice, but it\'s allowed if the secret word has multiple R\'s.\n\nBut so far, we have no evidence of duplicates.\n\n""VIRGO"" only has one R.\n\nBoth are valid.\n\nNow, which one to choose?\n\n""VIRGO"": tests O at position 4.\n""FUROR"": tests O at position 3 and possible duplicate R.\n\nWe also have to consider the letters.\n\nIn ""VIRGO"", we test V, I, G.\n\nIn ""FUROR"", we test F, U, and see if R appears again.\n\nBoth are good.\n\nBut note, in ""FUROR"", position 4 is R, which is not the fixed R; it\'s an additional R. And we know R is not at position 1 or 3, but position 4 hasn\'t been tested for R? We haven\'t tried R at position 4.\n\nBut we know R is in the word at position 2, so if there is a duplicate, it could be elsewhere.\n\nBut we don\'t have information on duplicates.\n\nTo test specifically for O\'s position, it\'s better to try ""VIRGO"" to test O at position 4 without introducing a duplicate.\n\nSimilarly, we can test O at position 3 later if needed.\n\nSince we have limited guesses, ""VIRGO"" might be safer.\n\nAnother word for O at position 3: ""GIROS"" but S excluded.\n\n""BIROS"" same issue.\n\n""LIROT"" T excluded? And L,I,R,O,T. T excluded.\n\n Not good.\n\n""MUROW"" W excluded.\n\nSo ""FUROR"" is one option, but it has duplicate R.\n\nAlternatively, ""VIRGO"" is duplicate-free.\n\nWe can choose ""VIRGO"".\n\nAlso, we haven\'t tested V, I, G, which are common.\n\nSo I think ""VIRGO"" is a good guess.\n\nTherefore, fourth guess: VIRGO\n\nPosition breakdown: \n- 0: V\n- 1: I\n- 2: R (fixed and known to be correct, so will show as ✓)\n- 3: G\n- 4: O\n\nWe can predict that R will be ✓, and feedback for V, I, G, O will depend.\n\nWe hope that if O is at 4, it shows correct, or else wrong position or not.\n\nSo let\'s go with that.### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Current Constraints from Previous Feedback**:\n   - **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)  \n     - R is in the word but not in position 1 (0-based index: index 1).  \n     - C, A, N, E are not in the word.  \n   \n   - **Guess 2: SPORT** → Feedback: S(x), P(x), O(-), R(-), T(x)  \n     - O is in the word but not in position 2 (index 2).  \n     - R is in the word but not in position 3 (index 3).  \n     - S, P, T are not in the word.  \n   \n   - **Guess 3: WORDY** → Feedback: W(x), O(-), R(✓), D(x), Y(x)  \n     - R is correct at position 2 (index 2, 0-based); the third letter is **R**. Word pattern: `_ _ R _ _ ?`.  \n     - O is in the word but not in position 1 (index 1).  \n     - W, D, Y are not in the word.  \n\n2. **Key Inferences**:\n   - **R Position**: Fixed at index 2 (third letter).  \n     - Confirmed positions: R cannot be at index 1 (from Guess 1) or index 3 (from Guess 2), so it must be at index 2 (as now confirmed).  \n   - **O Position**: Must be in the word, but not at index 1 (from WORDY feedback) or index 2 (from SPORT feedback). Remaining possible positions: index 0 (first letter), index 3 (fourth letter), or index 4 (fifth letter).  \n   - **Excluded Letters**: C, A, N, E, S, P, T, W, D, Y (all marked ""x"" at least once).  \n   - **Available Letters**: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, R, U, V, X, Z. R is fixed at index 2, so it cannot appear elsewhere unless duplicated (no evidence of duplicates yet). O must appear once at an untested position (0, 3, or 4).  \n\n3. **Strategy for Guess 4**:\n   - **Prioritize testing O positions**: Since O has only three possible untested positions (0, 3, 4), choose a word that tests one of these while introducing new common letters to gather more information.  \n   - **Position Focus**: Testing O at index 4 (fifth letter) is efficient, as index 0 and 3 can be covered in later guesses if needed.  \n   - **Letter Selection**: Use available consonants (e.g., V, I, G) that are common and untested. Avoid excluded letters and duplicates.  \n   - Word pattern: `_ _ R _ O` (to test O at index 4).  \n\n4. **Word Choice**:\n   - **Candidate: ""VIRGO""** (a valid English word meaning a zodiac sign or ""virgin"").  \n     - Fits pattern: `V (index 0), I (index 1), R (index 2, confirmed ✓), G (index 3), O (index 4)`.  \n     - Tests O at position 4 (new).  \n     - Introduces new letters V, I, G (all high-frequency, maximizing information gain).  \n     - Avoids excluded letters and duplicates.  \n   - **Alternatives considered**:  \n     - O at index 0: Options like ""OUIJA"" or ""OAKER"" fail due to excluded letters (A, E) or invalidity.  \n     - O at index 3: Words like ""FUROR"" (O at index 3) introduce duplicate R, which is risky without evidence of duplicates; ""BIROS"" or ""LIROT"" are invalid due to excluded letters (S, T).  \n     - ""VIRGO"" efficiently balances position testing and new letter coverage.  \n\n5. **Expected Feedback**:  \n   - R at index 2 will show as ✓ (already confirmed).  \n   - Results for V, I, G, and O will provide new info:  \n     - O at index 4: If ✓, position solved; if - , O must be at index 0 or 3.  \n     - V, I, G feedback will reveal if any are in the word and their positions.  \n\n6. **Remaining Guesses**: 2 guesses left if needed (after this).\n\n<guess>VIRGO</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: SPORT -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(-) R(-) T(x)\nGuess 3: WORDY -> FEEDBACK: W(x) O(-) R(✓) D(x) Y(x)\nGuess 4: VIRGO -> FEEDBACK: V(x) I(x) R(✓) G(x) O(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the feedback from four guesses:\n\nGuess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\n  - R is in the word but not in position 1 (index 1, 0-based).\n  - C, A, N, E are not in the word.\n\nGuess 2: SPORT -> S(x) P(x) O(-) R(-) T(x)\n  - O is in the word but not in position 2 (index 2).\n  - R is in the word but not in position 3 (index 3).\n  - S, P, T are not in the word.\n\nGuess 3: WORDY -> W(x) O(-) R(✓) D(x) Y(x)\n  - R is correct at position 2 (index 2).

The word has the pattern: _ _ R _ _ (third letter is R).\n\n2. O is in the word, but:\n   - Not at position 1 (from WORDY)\n   - Not at position 2 (from SPORT, and position 2 is R so it can\'t be anyway)\n   - Not at position 4 (from VIRGO)\n   - Therefore, O must be at position 3 (index 3, the fourth letter). The only remaining position is index 3.\n\nSo the word is: _ _ R O _\n\n3. Excluded letters: C, A, N, E, S, P, T, W, D, Y, V, I, G (all marked \'x\' in at least one guess).\n\n4. Available letters: B, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, X, Z (and O and R are already placed, but we need to fill the first two and last positions).\n\nBut note: O is now placed at position 3? Let me confirm.\n\nWe have positions: 0,1,2,3,4\n- Position 2: R (fixed)\n- O must be in the word, and the only position left for O is 3? Because:\n  - Position 0: not tested for O? But we don\'t know if it\'s at 0? \n  - From feedback: \n      - Guess 2: O not at 2\n      - Guess 3: O not at 1\n      - Guess 4: O not at 4\n  - So the only positions left are 0 and 3? But position 0 hasn\'t been tested for O.\n\nWait, position 0 hasn\'t been tested? In the guesses so far, we haven\'t placed O at position 0.\n\nBut we know O is in the word and not at positions 1,2,4. So it must be at position 0 or 3? But position 0 is the first letter.\n\nIn the pattern _ _ R _ _, we have positions 0,1,2,3,4. Position 2 is R. O cannot be at 1,2,4. So it must be at 0 or 3.\n\nBut in the feedback from VIRGO, O was at position 4 and it was marked as wrong position (-), meaning O is in the word but not at 4. Similarly, from WORDY, O at 1 was wrong position, and from SPORT, O at 2 was wrong position.\n\nSo O must be at position 0 or 3.\n\nBut we have the pattern: _ _ R _ _\n\nIf O is at position 0, then the word is O _ R _ _\n\nIf O is at position 3, then the word is _ _ R O _\n\nWe need to determine which one.\n\nAlso, we have to fill the other positions with available letters.\n\nBut we have two possibilities for O.\n\nNow, we have only two guesses left (if we count, we are on the fifth guess).\n\nWe need to choose a word that can test between these two cases.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has O at position 3 and tests the other letters, or one that has O at position 0.\n\nBut we also need to test the remaining letters.\n\nAvailable letters: B, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, X, Z\n\nWe can try to form words for both cases.\n\nFirst, if O is at position 3: pattern _ _ R O _\n\nThe first two letters and the last letter need to be filled with available letters.\n\nPossible words:\n- With common letters: e.g., ""BURRO"" but R is at 2 and 4? But we have R at 2, so if we put R at 4, it might be duplicate. Also, B and U: B0, U1, R2, O3, R4? But we don\'t know about duplicates. Also, U is available.\n\nBut ""BURRO"" has duplicate R and O at 3? But O at 3 is what we are testing.\n\nBut let\'s see if it\'s valid.\n\nAnother: ""FUROR"" we thought earlier, but F is available? F is available, but in ""FUROR"": F0, U1, R2, O3, R4. Duplicate R.\n\nBut we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed.\n\nBut we can avoid for now.\n\nWithout duplicate: we need a word that ends with a letter other than R.\n\nFor example, ""BROLO""? Not a word.\n\n""KROON"" has O at 3? K0, R1, O2, O3, N? But N is excluded, and O at 2 is not allowed (position 2 is R, fixed).\n\nPosition 2 is R, so we cannot put O there.\n\nPattern: _ _ R O _ -> so position 0,1, and 4 to fill.\n\nWith available letters: B, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, X, Z\n\nFor position 4: it must be a consonant, say L: then we need a word like ? ? R O L\n\nExamples: ""CAROL"" has C and A, excluded.\n\n""FROWL"" has F, R, O, W, L? But W is excluded.\n\nW is excluded from Guess 3.\n\n""BROIL"" has B, R, O, I, L? But I is excluded from Guess 4.\n\nI is excluded.\n\n""GROWL"" G excluded.\n\nNot working.\n\n""MUROX"" not a word.\n\nPerhaps ""HURON"" but H,U,R,O,N? N excluded.\n\nThis is difficult.\n\nNow, if O is at position 0: pattern O _ R _ _\n\nThen positions: 0:O, 1:?, 2:R, 3:?, 4:?\n\nAvailable letters for position 1,3,4: B, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, X, Z\n\nAnd O at 0.\n\nFor example, ""OURLY"" but Y excluded.\n\n""OUBIT"" T excluded.\n\n""OUPHE"" E excluded.\n\n""OUNCE"" E and C excluded.\n\n""OUNCE"" not valid.\n\n""OORIE"" E and O duplicate? O at 0 and 1? But position 1 is O? But we know O cannot be at position 1 from Guess 3? In Guess 3, WORDY had O at 1 and it was wrong position, so O is not at position 1. So we cannot have O at position 1.\n\nTherefore, in the pattern O _ R _ _, position 1 cannot be O, so it must be a different letter.\n\nSimilarly, position 3 and 4.\n\nSo for O at 0: O ? R ? ? with ? not O and not excluded.\n\nWords: ""OFLRY"" not valid.\n\n""OAKER"" A excluded.\n\n""OCHER"" C and E excluded.\n\n""OGRES"" E and G excluded.\n\n""OHMIC"" H,M,I,C? I and C excluded.\n\n""OLEIC"" E and I excluded.\n\n""OLIOS"" duplicate O? O at 0 and 3? But position 3 O? But we don\'t know, but we have to avoid duplicate for now? And S excluded.\n\n""OMBRE"" E excluded.\n\n""ONCER"" E and C excluded.\n\n""OORIE"" E excluded.\n\n""OPING"" P and G excluded? P excluded, G excluded.\n\n""ORLOP"" O at 0 and 3? Duplicate O? And P excluded.\n\n""OUPED"" E and D excluded.\n\n""OUTBY"" T and Y excluded.\n\n""OUZEL"" E and Z? Z available, but E excluded.\n\n""OVULE"" E and V excluded.\n\nNone seem to work.\n\nPerhaps we missed a word.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the word has duplicate letters? For example, if O is at both 0 and 3? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut let\'s list all possible words that fit the pattern and use available letters.\n\nPattern: _ _ R _ _\n\nWith O in the word at either position 0 or 3.\n\nAnd available letters: B, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, X, Z\n\nAlso, the word must contain O.\n\nSo for O at position 0: O _ R _ _\n\nThen the word must have O at 0, then a letter from available at 1, then R at 2, then a letter at 3 and 4 from available.\n\nAnd the letter at 1,3,4 cannot be excluded.\n\nPossible letters for position 1: B,F,H,J,K,L,M,Q,U,X,Z\n\nPosition 3 and 4: same.\n\nAnd the word must be valid.\n\nFor example:\n- ""OUBER"" not valid.\n- ""OULRY"" not.\n- ""OUMAS"" not common.\n- ""OURIE"" not valid.\n\n""OUNCE"" not.\n\nPerhaps ""OFLRY"" not.\n\nMaybe ""OAKER"" not.\n\nThis is not working.\n\nFor O at position 3: _ _ R O _\n\nThen positions 0,1,4 to fill with available letters.\n\nFor example:\n- ""BUROO"" not valid.\n- ""FUROL"" not.\n- ""HUROS"" S excluded.\n- ""JUROK"" not.\n- ""KUROO"" not.\n- ""MUROX"" not.\n- ""QUORO"" not.\n\n""FUROR"" is a valid word: F0, U1, R2, O3, R4.\n\nLetters: F, U, R, O, R. R is duplicated, but R is already fixed at position 2, so if the word has another R at 4, it\'s possible.\n\nAnd F and U are available.\n\nAlso, O is at position 3.\n\nSo ""FUROR"" is a candidate.\n\nAnother possibility: ""BURRO"" B0, U1, R2, O3, R4. Also valid.\n\n""BURRO"" is a word.\n\nBoth have duplicate R.\n\nBut we don\'t have evidence against duplicates.\n\nAnother word: ""MURO"" is 4 letters.\n\n""KROON"" has O at 3? K0, R1, O2, O3, N4? But position 2 is O? But we have R fixed at position 2, so cannot. And N excluded.\n\nNot.\n\n""LORDO"" L,O,R,D,O? D excluded and duplicate O.\n\nNot.\n\nSo the only common words seem to be ""FUROR"" and ""BURRO"", both with duplicate R.\n\nWe can choose one.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we would get.\n\nIf we guess ""FUROR"", what would the feedback be?\n\nPosition 0: F\nPosition 1: U\nPosition 2: R (correct, ✓)\nPosition 3: O\nPosition 4: R\n\nNow, we know R is at position 2, so that will be ✓.\n\nO is at position 3. If the secret word has O at position 3, it will be ✓. If not, it might be - or x, but we think it should be at 3.\n\nBut we are not sure if O is at 0 or 3.\n\nIn ""FUROR"", if the secret word has O at position 0, then O at position 3 would be marked as - if it\'s in the word but wrong position, or x if not, but since O is in the word, it would be -.\n\nBut we also have R at position 4. If the secret word has only one R, then R at position 4 would be marked as x or -? If there is no duplicate, then R at 4 is not present, so x. But if there is duplicate, it might be - or ✓ if position 4 is R.\n\nBut we don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has O at position 3 and a different letter at position 4, but we couldn\'t find one.\n\nAnother idea: what if we test O at position 0 with a word that has O at 0 and uses common letters.\n\nFor example, ""OUBIT"" is not valid.\n\n""OUNCE"" not.\n\n""OULAK"" not.\n\nPerhaps ""OUJDA"" not.\n\nMaybe ""OKRUG"" not common.\n\nI think we have to go with ""FUROR"" or ""BURRO"".\n\nLet\'s choose ""FUROR"" as it is a valid word.\n\nBut we have to consider that if O is at position 0, then ""FUROR"" would have O at 3 which is wrong position, and we might not solve.\n\nBut we have two guesses left, so we can recover.\n\nAlternatively, we can guess a word that has O at position 3 and also tests other letters, and if it\'s not, then O must be at 0.\n\nBut we have to find such a word.\n\nSince we have only two positions for O (0 or 3), we can guess a word with O at 3 and see.\n\nIf it\'s not, then O is at 0.\n\nSo for guess 5, we can guess a word with O at position 3.\n\n""FUROR"" is one.\n\nBut let\'s see if there is a word without duplicate.\n\nFor example, ""BUOYS"" S excluded.\n\n""CLOYS"" C and S excluded.\n\n""JOYED"" D and Y excluded.\n\n""LOYAL"" A and L? L is available, but A excluded.\n\n""MOYLS"" not valid.\n\n""NOYAU"" A and U? A excluded.\n\n""QUOIF"" Q,U,O,I,F? I excluded.\n\nNot working.\n\n""SULCI"" S excluded.\n\nSo ""FUROR"" or ""BURRO"" are the options.\n\nI\'ll go with ""FUROR"".\n\nSo guess: FUROR\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we got so far.\n\nAnother thought: in Guess 4, VIRGO had O at 4 and it was marked as - , meaning O is in the word but not at 4. So if we put O at 3 in ""FUROR"", it might be correct.\n\nSimilarly, if we put O at 0 in a guess, it might be correct.\n\nBut we don\'t have a good word for O at 0.\n\nSo for now, ""FUROR"" is a reasonable guess.\n\nSo fifth guess: FUROR\n\nBut let\'s format it.### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Current Constraints from Previous Feedback**:\n   - **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)  \n     - R is in the word but not at position 1 (index 1, 0-based).  \n     - C, A, N, E are excluded.  \n   \n   - **Guess 2: SPORT** → Feedback: S(x), P(x), O(-), R(-), T(x)  \n     - O is in the word but not at position 2 (index 2).  \n     - R is in the word but not at position 3 (index 3).  \n     - S, P, T are excluded.  \n   \n   - **Guess 3: WORDY** → Feedback: W(x), O(-), R(✓), D(x), Y(x)  \n     - R is correct at position 2 (index 2); word pattern: `_ _ R _ _`.  \n     - O is in the word but not at position 1 (index 1).  \n     - W, D, Y are excluded.  \n   \n   - **Guess 4: VIRGO** → Feedback: V(x), I(x), R(✓), G(x), O(-)  \n     - R is correct at position 2 (index 2), confirming the pattern `_ _ R _ _`.  \n     - O is in the word but not at position 4 (index 4).  \n     - V, I, G are excluded.  \n\n2. **Key Inferences**:\n   - **Fixed Position**: R is locked at index 2 (third letter).  \n   - **O Position**: O must be in the word but cannot be at positions 1, 2, or 4 (from feedback). The only remaining positions are index 0 (first letter) or index 3 (fourth letter).  \n   - **Excluded Letters**: C, A, N, E, S, P, T, W, D, Y, V, I, G (all marked ""x"" at least once).  \n   - **Available Letters**: B, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, X, Z (must be used for positions 0, 1, and 4).  \n   - **Word Pattern**: `_ _ R _ _` with O at index 0 or 3.  \n\n3. **Strategy for Guess 5**:\n   - **Test O at Position 3**: Since O cannot be at positions 1, 2, or 4, position 3 (fourth letter) is a high-probability candidate. Testing this efficiently narrows down O\'s location.  \n   - **Cover New Letters**: Use available consonants (e.g., F, U, R) to maximize information. R is fixed at index 2, but duplicates are possible (no evidence against them yet).  \n   - **Word Choice**: ""FUROR"" fits:  \n     - Positions: F (index 0), U (index 1), R (index 2, ✓), O (index 3), R (index 4).  \n     - Tests O at index 3 (critical for solving position).  \n     - Tests F and U (new letters) and checks for R duplication at index 4.  \n     - Valid English word (meaning ""a general commotion or uproar"").  \n\n4. **Expected Outcomes**:\n   - If O is at index 3, it will show as ✓ or - (confirming position).  \n   - Feedback on F, U, and the second R (index 4) will reveal if they are in the word and their positions.  \n   - If O is not at index 3, it must be at index 0, and we can adjust the final guess accordingly.\n\n<guess>FUROR</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: SPORT -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(-) R(-) T(x)\nGuess 3: WORDY -> FEEDBACK: W(x) O(-) R(✓) D(x) Y(x)\nGuess 4: VIRGO -> FEEDBACK: V(x) I(x) R(✓) G(x) O(-)\nGuess 5: FUROR -> FEEDBACK: F(x) U(✓) R(✓) O(✓) R(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback for Guess 5: FUROR -> F(x) U(✓) R(✓) O(✓) R(✓)

Breaking down the feedback:
- F: not in the word (x)
- U: correct position (✓) at index 1 (second letter)
- R: correct position (✓) at index 2 (third letter) [as we already knew]
- O: correct position (✓) at index 3 (fourth letter)
- R: correct position (✓) at index 4 (fifth letter)

This means:
- The secret word has U at position 1 (index 1).
- O is at position 3 (index 3).
- R is at position 2 (index 2) and also at position 4 (index 4). So there are two R's in the word.
- F is not in the word.

Now, we can construct the word:
- Position 0: unknown (first letter)
- Position 1: U (second letter)
- Position 2: R (third letter)
- Position 3: O (fourth letter)
- Position 4: R (fifth letter)

So the word pattern is: _ U R O R

We only need to find the first letter (position 0).

From previous feedback, we have a list of excluded letters: C, A, N, E, S, P, T, W, D, Y, V, I, G, F (all marked 'x' in previous guesses).

Available letters: B, H, J, K, L, M, Q, X, Z (and possibly others, but we have to check).

The word must be a valid English word of the form ? U R O R.

We can list possible words:
- ""BUROR"" is not a common word? Let me check.
- ""CUROR"" has C, excluded.
- ""DUROR"" has D, excluded.
- ""FUROR"" we just guessed, but F is excluded and we know it's not the word because F was marked absent.
- ""GUROR"" not a word.
- ""HUROR"" not common.
- ""JUROR"" - this is a valid word (a member of a jury). Letters: J, U, R, O, R.

Check if J is excluded? In previous guesses, J has not been used, so it's not excluded. We have not guessed J before.

Similarly, ""MUROR"" not a word.

""RUROR"" not.

So ""JUROR"" is a strong candidate.

Are there others?
- ""KUROR"" not a word.
- ""LUROR"" not.
- ""MUROR"" not.
- ""NUROR"" has N, excluded.
- ""PUROR"" has P, excluded.
- ""QUROR"" not.
- ""RUROR"" not.
- ""SUROR"" has S, excluded.
- ""TUROR"" has T, excluded.
- ""UROR"" is 4 letters.
- ""VUROR"" not, and V excluded.
- ""ZUROR"" not.

So the only common word that fits is ""JUROR"".

Therefore, the secret word must be ""JUROR"".

We have one guess left (this is the sixth guess), so we can guess ""JUROR"".

But let's confirm the pattern: J U R O R
- Position 0: J
- Position 1: U (which we know is correct)
- Position 2: R (correct)
- Position 3: O (correct)
- Position 4: R (correct)

And J is not excluded.

So we should guess ""JUROR"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, I have deduced the secret word. Here's a step-by-step reasoning:

### Key Insights from Feedback:
1. **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: 
   - R is in the word but not at position 1 (index 1, 0-based).
   - C, A, N, E are excluded.
2. **Guess 2 (SPORT)**:
   - O is in the word but not at position 2 (index 2).
   - R is in the word but not at position 3 (index 3).
   - S, P, T are excluded.
3. **Guess 3 (WORDY)**:
   - R is confirmed at position 2 (index 2). Word pattern: `_ _ R _ _`.
   - O is in the word but not at position 1 (index 1).
   - W, D, Y are excluded.
4. **Guess 4 (VIRGO)**:
   - O is in the word but not at position 4 (index 4).
   - V, I, G are excluded.
5. **Guess 5 (FUROR)**:
   - U is confirmed at position 1 (index 1). Updated pattern: `_ U R _ _`.
   - O is confirmed at position 3 (index 3). Updated pattern: `_ U R O _`.
   - R is confirmed at position 4 (index 4). Updated pattern: `_ U R O R`.
   - F is excluded.

### Deductions:
- The secret word pattern is `_ U R O R` (letters at indices 1, 2, 3, and 4 are fixed: U, R, O, R).
- Only position 0 (first letter) is unknown.
- **Excluded letters** (from all feedback): C, A, N, E, S, P, T, W, D, Y, V, I, G, F (14 letters).
- **Available letters for position 0**: B, H, J, K, L, M, Q, X, Z (9 letters).
- The word must be a valid English word. After checking possible options:
  - ""JUROR"" is the only common English word that fits the pattern `_ U R O R` and uses an available letter (J). Other combinations (e.g., BUROR, HUROR, KUROR) are invalid words.

### Conclusion:
The secret word is **JUROR** (meaning a member of a jury). This guess uses the confirmed positions for U, R, O, and R, and the only viable first letter (J) from the remaining options.

<guess>JUROR</guess>",JUROR,"We have the feedback for Guess 5: FUROR -> F(x) U(✓) R(✓) O(✓) R(✓)

Breaking down the feedback:
- F: not in the word (x)
- U: correct position (✓) at index 1 (second letter)
- R: correct position (✓) at index 2 (third letter) [as we already knew]
- O: correct position (✓) at index 3 (fourth letter)
- R: correct position (✓) at index 4 (fifth letter)

This means:
- The secret word has U at position 1 (index 1).
- O is at position 3 (index 3).
- R is at position 2 (index 2) and also at position 4 (index 4). So there are two R's in the word.
- F is not in the word.

Now, we can construct the word:
- Position 0: unknown (first letter)
- Position 1: U (second letter)
- Position 2: R (third letter)
- Position 3: O (fourth letter)
- Position 4: R (fifth letter)

So the word pattern is: _ U R O R

We only need to find the first letter (position 0).

From previous feedback, we have a list of excluded letters: C, A, N, E, S, P, T, W, D, Y, V, I, G, F (all marked 'x' in previous guesses).

Available letters: B, H, J, K, L, M, Q, X, Z (and possibly others, but we have to check).

The word must be a valid English word of the form ? U R O R.

We can list possible words:
- ""BUROR"" is not a common word? Let me check.
- ""CUROR"" has C, excluded.
- ""DUROR"" has D, excluded.
- ""FUROR"" we just guessed, but F is excluded and we know it's not the word because F was marked absent.
- ""GUROR"" not a word.
- ""HUROR"" not common.
- ""JUROR"" - this is a valid word (a member of a jury). Letters: J, U, R, O, R.

Check if J is excluded? In previous guesses, J has not been used, so it's not excluded. We have not guessed J before.

Similarly, ""MUROR"" not a word.

""RUROR"" not.

So ""JUROR"" is a strong candidate.

Are there others?
- ""KUROR"" not a word.
- ""LUROR"" not.
- ""MUROR"" not.
- ""NUROR"" has N, excluded.
- ""PUROR"" has P, excluded.
- ""QUROR"" not.
- ""RUROR"" not.
- ""SUROR"" has S, excluded.
- ""TUROR"" has T, excluded.
- ""UROR"" is 4 letters.
- ""VUROR"" not, and V excluded.
- ""ZUROR"" not.

So the only common word that fits is ""JUROR"".

Therefore, the secret word must be ""JUROR"".

We have one guess left (this is the sixth guess), so we can guess ""JUROR"".

But let's confirm the pattern: J U R O R
- Position 0: J
- Position 1: U (which we know is correct)
- Position 2: R (correct)
- Position 3: O (correct)
- Position 4: R (correct)

And J is not excluded.

So we should guess ""JUROR"".Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, I have deduced the secret word. Here's a step-by-step reasoning:

### Key Insights from Feedback:
1. **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: 
   - R is in the word but not at position 1 (index 1, 0-based).
   - C, A, N, E are excluded.
2. **Guess 2 (SPORT)**:
   - O is in the word but not at position 2 (index 2).
   - R is in the word but not at position 3 (index 3).
   - S, P, T are excluded.
3. **Guess 3 (WORDY)**:
   - R is confirmed at position 2 (index 2). Word pattern: `_ _ R _ _`.
   - O is in the word but not at position 1 (index 1).
   - W, D, Y are excluded.
4. **Guess 4 (VIRGO)**:
   - O is in the word but not at position 4 (index 4).
   - V, I, G are excluded.
5. **Guess 5 (FUROR)**:
   - U is confirmed at position 1 (index 1). Updated pattern: `_ U R _ _`.
   - O is confirmed at position 3 (index 3). Updated pattern: `_ U R O _`.
   - R is confirmed at position 4 (index 4). Updated pattern: `_ U R O R`.
   - F is excluded.

### Deductions:
- The secret word pattern is `_ U R O R` (letters at indices 1, 2, 3, and 4 are fixed: U, R, O, R).
- Only position 0 (first letter) is unknown.
- **Excluded letters** (from all feedback): C, A, N, E, S, P, T, W, D, Y, V, I, G, F (14 letters).
- **Available letters for position 0**: B, H, J, K, L, M, Q, X, Z (9 letters).
- The word must be a valid English word. After checking possible options:
  - ""JUROR"" is the only common English word that fits the pattern `_ U R O R` and uses an available letter (J). Other combinations (e.g., BUROR, HUROR, KUROR) are invalid words.

### Conclusion:
The secret word is **JUROR** (meaning a member of a jury). This guess uses the confirmed positions for U, R, O, and R, and the only viable first letter (J) from the remaining options.",Guess 6: JUROR -> FEEDBACK: J(✓) U(✓) R(✓) O(✓) R(✓),SUCCESS
