We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the fifth letter)

Therefore, we know:
- The second letter is R.
- The fifth letter is E.
- The letters C, A, and N are not in the word.

We must avoid using C, A, and N in our next guess.

We also know that the word has the form: _ R _ _ E

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that fits this pattern and does not contain C, A, or N.

Let's think of words that have R in the second position and E at the end.

Common patterns: 
- The first letter can be any consonant or vowel except C, A, N (and we should avoid using letters we know are absent, but we don't have more info yet).
- Similarly, the third and fourth letters are unknown.

We should try to use a word that includes other common letters to test more possibilities.

Common letters in English: E, T, O, I, S, R, etc. (but R and E are already known and in place).

We can try to use a word that has T, O, I, S, L, etc.

Let me list some words that fit _ R _ _ E:

Possible words:
- TRADE (but A is absent, so not allowed because A is not in the word)
- BRIDE (B, R, I, D, E) -> B is not forbidden, I and D are new.
- GRIME (G, R, I, M, E)
- PRICE (but C is absent, so invalid)
- WRITE (W, R, I, T, E)
- FRISE (F, R, I, S, E) - but is it a word? (Frise is a valid word, meaning an architectural ornament)

But note: we must avoid A, C, N.

Let me check the feedback again: we have two correct letters: R and E in positions 2 and 5.

We also know that C, A, N are absent.

So, for the next guess, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Possible candidates:
- ""BRINE"" but N is absent, so invalid.
- ""TRICE"" but C is absent.
- ""DRIVE"" (D, R, I, V, E) -> V is a less common letter, but it's acceptable.

Alternatively, we can try:
- ""ROUSE"" (R, O, U, S, E) but R is in the first position? No, we need R in the second. ""ROUSE"" has R as the first letter, so it doesn't fit.

We need the second letter to be R and the fifth to be E.

So, let's think of words that start with any letter (except C, A, N) then R, then any three letters (except C, A, N) and end with E.

Examples:
- BRUTE (B, R, U, T, E)
- GRAPE (but A is absent) -> invalid
- PRUNE (but N and U? N is absent) -> invalid
- TRIPE (T, R, I, P, E)
- WRITE (W, R, I, T, E)
- FRISE (F, R, I, S, E) - if accepted.

But we also want to cover common letters. Since we have two letters fixed, we can test three new letters.

I think ""WRITE"" is a good candidate: it uses W, I, T which are common, and we avoid the forbidden letters.

Another option: ""BRIDE"" (B, R, I, D, E) - tests B, I, D.

But note: we have E already in the fifth position, so we don't need to test E again, but it's fixed.

We can also consider ""PRIDE"" (P, R, I, D, E) - but P is less common.

Alternatively, ""TRITE"" (T, R, I, T, E) - but it has two T's, which might be useful if T is in the word.

But let's choose a word that maximizes new information.

I'll go with ""WRITE"": 
- W is a new letter in position 1.
- I is in position 3.
- T is in position 4.

If we get feedback, we can learn about W, I, T.

Another common word: ""ROGUE"" but R is in the first position? No, we need R in second. ""R"" must be the second letter, so the word must be of the form: [letter] R [letter] [letter] E.

""ROGUE"" is R first, then O, then G, then U, then E -> so it doesn't have R in the second position.

Similarly, ""URINE"" has U, R, I, N, E -> but N is absent, so invalid.

""CRIME"" has C, which is absent.

So, ""WRITE"" seems good.

But let me check if there's a word that uses S, which is very common. For example, ""ARISE"" but A is absent and R is in the first position? ""ARISE"" is A (absent) and R is second? Actually, ""ARISE"": A (1st), R (2nd), I (3rd), S (4th), E (5th). But A is absent, so we cannot use it.

""PRISE"" (P, R, I, S, E) - meaning to force open. That's a valid word.

""RISE"" is only 4 letters.

So, ""PRISE"" is an option.

But I think ""WRITE"" is more common.

Alternatively, ""TRICE"" is invalid because of C.

Another word: ""BRINE"" has N, which is absent.

So, between ""WRITE"" and ""PRISE"", I think both are acceptable.

But ""PRISE"" uses P and S, and ""WRITE"" uses W and T.

Since T is more common than P, I'll go with ""WRITE"".

But note: we have two fixed letters (R and E) and we are testing three new letters. We have 6 tries, so it's okay.

We can also consider ""DRIVE"" (D, R, I, V, E) - V is less common, but it's a valid word.

I think ""WRITE"" is a good choice.

So, my next guess is ""WRITE"".

But let me confirm: 
- W in position 1: if it's correct, we get a check; if not, we know it's absent or misplaced.
- I in position 3: same.
- T in position 4: same.

We avoid C, A, N.

Therefore, I'll guess ""WRITE"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and N are not in the word (marked with ""x"").
- R is in the correct second position (marked with ""✓"").
- E is in the correct fifth position (marked with ""✓"").

This means the secret word has the pattern: _ R _ _ E, and it does not contain C, A, or N.

For the next guess:
- The word must be 5 letters, valid, and avoid using C, A, or N.
- To maximize information, I should test new common letters (e.g., T, I, S, L, O) in the unknown positions (1st, 3rd, and 4th).
- ""WRITE"" fits the pattern (_ R _ _ E), avoids forbidden letters, and tests new common letters (W, I, T).

- ""WRITE"" fits the pattern (_ R _ _ E), avoids forbidden letters, and tests new common letters (W, I, T).

(Frise is a valid word, meaning an architectural ornament)\n\nBut note: we must avoid A, C, N.\n\nLet me check the feedback again: we have two correct letters: R and E in positions 2 and 5.\n\nWe also know that C, A, N are absent.\n\nSo, for the next guess, we want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nPossible candidates:\n- ""BRINE"" but N is absent, so invalid.\n- ""TRICE"" but C is absent.\n- ""DRIVE"" (D, R, I, V, E) -> V is a less common letter, but it\'s acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, we can try:\n- ""ROUSE"" (R, O, U, S, E) but R is in the first position? No, we need R in the second. ""ROUSE"" has R as the first letter, so it doesn\'t fit.\n\nWe need the second letter to be R and the fifth to be E.\n\nSo, let\'s think of words that start with any letter (except C, A, N) then R, then any three letters (except C, A, N) and end with E.\n\nExamples:\n- BRUTE (B, R, U, T, E)\n- GRAPE (but A is absent) -> invalid\n- PRUNE (but N and U? N is absent) -> invalid\n- TRIPE (T, R, I, P, E)\n- WRITE (W, R, I, T, E)\n- FRISE (F, R, I, S, E) - if accepted.\n\nBut we also want to cover common letters. Since we have two letters fixed, we can test three new letters.\n\nI think ""WRITE"" is a good candidate: it uses W, I, T which are common, and we avoid the forbidden letters.\n\nAnother option: ""BRIDE"" (B, R, I, D, E) - tests B, I, D.\n\nBut note: we have E already in the fifth position, so we don\'t need to test E again, but it\'s fixed.\n\nWe can also consider ""PRIDE"" (P, R, I, D, E) - but P is less common.\n\nAlternatively, ""TRITE"" (T, R, I, T, E) - but it has two T\'s, which might be useful if T is in the word.\n\nBut let\'s choose a word that maximizes new information.\n\nI\'ll go with ""WRITE"": \n- W is a new letter in position 1.\n- I is in position 3.\n- T is in position 4.\n\nIf we get feedback, we can learn about W, I, T.\n\nAnother common word: ""ROGUE"" but R is in the first position? No, we need R in second. ""R"" must be the second letter, so the word must be of the form: [letter] R [letter] [letter] E.\n\n""ROGUE"" is R first, then O, then G, then U, then E -> so it doesn\'t have R in the second position.\n\nSimilarly, ""URINE"" has U, R, I, N, E -> but N is absent, so invalid.\n\n""CRIME"" has C, which is absent.\n\nSo, ""WRITE"" seems good.\n\nBut let me check if there\'s a word that uses S, which is very common. For example, ""ARISE"" but A is absent and R is in the first position? ""ARISE"" is A (absent) and R is second? Actually, ""ARISE"": A (1st), R (2nd), I (3rd), S (4th), E (5th). But A is absent, so we cannot use it.\n\n""PRISE"" (P, R, I, S, E) - meaning to force open. That\'s a valid word.\n\n""RISE"" is only 4 letters.\n\nSo, ""PRISE"" is an option.\n\nBut I think ""WRITE"" is more common.\n\nAlternatively, ""TRICE"" is invalid because of C.\n\nAnother word: ""BRINE"" has N, which is absent.\n\nSo, between ""WRITE"" and ""PRISE"", I think both are acceptable.\n\nBut ""PRISE"" uses P and S, and ""WRITE"" uses W and T.\n\nSince T is more common than P, I\'ll go with ""WRITE"".\n\nBut note: we have two fixed letters (R and E) and we are testing three new letters. We have 6 tries, so it\'s okay.\n\nWe can also consider ""DRIVE"" (D, R, I, V, E) - V is less common, but it\'s a valid word.\n\nI think ""WRITE"" is a good choice.\n\nSo, my next guess is ""WRITE"".\n\nBut let me confirm: \n- W in position 1: if it\'s correct, we get a check; if not, we know it\'s absent or misplaced.\n- I in position 3: same.\n- T in position 4: same.\n\nWe avoid C, A, N.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll guess ""WRITE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, A, and N are not in the word (marked with ""x"").\n- R is in the correct second position (marked with ""✓"").\n- E is in the correct fifth position (marked with ""✓"").\n\nThis means the secret word has the pattern: _ R _ _ E, and it does not contain C, A, or N.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- The word must be 5 letters, valid, and avoid using C, A, or N.\n- To maximize information, I should test new common letters (e.g., T, I, S, L, O) in the unknown positions (1st, 3rd, and 4th).\n- ""WRITE"" fits the pattern (_ R _ _ E), avoids forbidden letters, and tests new common letters (W, I, T).\n\n<guess>write</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: write -> FEEDBACK: W(x) R(✓) I(✓) T(x) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: absent (x)
- R: correct position (✓) -> so the second letter is R
- A: absent (x)
- N: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓) -> so the fifth letter is E

Thus, the word has the pattern: _ R _ _ E, and the letters C, A, N are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""write""
- W: absent (x) -> so W is not in the word
- R: correct position (✓) -> already known
- I: correct position (✓) -> so the third letter is I
- T: absent (x) -> so T is not in the word
- E: correct position (✓) -> already known

Now we know:
- The word pattern is: _ R I _ E
- Absent letters: C, A, N, W, T
- Correct letters: R (position 2), I (position 3), E (position 5)

So the word is of the form: [letter] R I [letter] E, and the missing letters are the first and fourth positions.

We also know that the word does not contain: C, A, N, W, T.

We need to find a word that fits: ? R I ? E, and the two missing letters must be from the remaining alphabet (excluding the absent letters).

Remaining common letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, X, Y, Z.

But we should focus on common letters to form valid words.

Possible words:
- The first position: can be any consonant or vowel (except A, E, I, O, U? but E and I are already used, but they can repeat? The feedback doesn't indicate that letters can't repeat, but in Wordle, words can have repeated letters. However, in the feedback so far, we haven't seen any repetition, and the absent letters are marked as absent, so if a letter is repeated, it might be shown differently. But in this case, we don't have any indication of repetition yet.

But note: in ""crane"", E was at the end and correct, and in ""write"", E is again at the end and correct. But that doesn't tell us about repetition elsewhere.

We must consider that the word might have repeated letters, but we have no evidence so far.

Given the pattern ? R I ? E, let's think of common words.

Common words that fit:
- ""PRIDE"": P R I D E -> but we have to check if P and D are allowed. P is not in the absent list, D is not either. But we have to see if it fits the feedback.
- ""BRIDE"": B R I D E -> similarly, B and D are allowed.
- ""GRIME"": G R I M E -> G and M are allowed.
- ""DRIVE"": D R I V E -> D and V are allowed.
- ""FRISE"": F R I S E -> F and S are allowed.

But we have to make a guess that tests new letters.

We know that the first letter is missing and the fourth letter is missing.

We also know that the word must be valid.

But note: we have only 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We have two letters to determine.

We can try to guess a word that uses common letters for the first and fourth positions to maximize the chance of getting it right or getting more information.

Alternatively, since we have two positions open, we might get it in this guess.

But let's see the feedback: we have three letters correct and in position: R, I, E. So we only need to find the first and fourth letters.

We can list the possible letters for the first position and fourth position.

First position: can be any letter except the absent ones (C, A, N, W, T) and also except the ones we know (R, I, E) because if they were in the first position, they would have been revealed? Not necessarily, because in ""crane"", we only tested E at the end, not at the beginning. Similarly, I was tested in the third position, not in the first.

But we know that the first letter is not W (from ""write"" feedback: W absent), and not C, A, N, T.

Similarly, the fourth letter: we know it's not T (from ""write"" feedback: T absent), and not C, A, N, W.

So possible first letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, X, Y, Z.

But we should consider common letters: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, S, U.

Similarly for the fourth letter: same set, but note that it could be a vowel or consonant.

Common words:
- PRIDE: P and D
- BRIDE: B and D
- GRIME: G and M
- DRIVE: D and V
- FRISE: F and S
- ORATE: but O and A? A is absent, so invalid.
- URINE: U and N? N is absent, invalid.
- TRIBE: T is absent, invalid.
- CRIME: C absent, invalid.

So we have a few candidates: PRIDE, BRIDE, GRIME, DRIVE, FRISE.

We need to choose one that tests letters we haven't tried yet.

We have not tested: B, D, F, G, M, P, S, V, etc.

In ""crane"" we tested: C, R, A, N, E
In ""write"" we tested: W, R, I, T, E

So the new letters we can test are: B, D, F, G, M, P, S, V, and others.

If we guess ""PRIDE"", we test P and D.
If we guess ""BRIDE"", we test B and D.
If we guess ""GRIME"", we test G and M.
If we guess ""DRIVE"", we test D and V (but D is repeated in testing if we choose multiple, but we can only choose one).

We are on the third guess, so we can try to cover more ground.

But note: if we guess a word that has one of the possibilities, we might get it right.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses two new letters that are common.

I think ""PRIDE"" is a good candidate because P and D are common.

But let me see if there is a word that uses S, which is very common. ""FRISE"" is a word, but it's less common. ""RISE"" is only 4 letters.

Another word: ""BRINE"" but N is absent, invalid.

""PRICE"" but C absent.

""TRIPE"" but T absent.

So, among the options, ""PRIDE"" and ""BRIDE"" are common.

But we have to avoid using letters that might be absent. We don't know about B, D, P, etc.

I think I'll go with ""PRIDE"" to test P and D.

If we guess ""PRIDE"":
- If P is correct in the first position, we get a check; if not, we know it's absent or misplaced (but since it's the first position, if absent, then we know P is not in the word).
- Similarly, D in the fourth position: if correct, check; if not, then D is absent or misplaced.

But note: if D is not in the fourth position, it might be in another position? But the only positions left are the first and fourth, and we are putting D in the fourth. If D is in the word but not in the fourth, it would be marked with '-' for wrong position. But in this pattern, the only unknown positions are first and fourth, so if D is in the word, it must be in the fourth position or not at all? Not necessarily, because if the word has two D's, but we don't know. But we haven't seen D in any feedback, so it's possible.

But to keep it simple, let's guess ""PRIDE"".

Alternatively, we can guess ""BRIDE"" to test B and D.

But I think ""PRIDE"" is fine.

Another common word: ""GRIPE"" but G R I P E -> that fits the pattern. And P is tested again? But we haven't tested P or G.

""GRIPE"": G in first, P in fourth.

Similarly, ""PRIDE"" has P in first and D in fourth.

I think both are good.

But let's choose one.

I'll go with ""PRIDE"".

So, the guess is ""PRIDE"".

But let me confirm the pattern: P R I D E -> positions: 1:P, 2:R, 3:I, 4:D, 5:E. That matches _ R I _ E.

And it avoids the absent letters.

So, <guess>pride</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C (absent), R (correct position), A (absent), N (absent), E (correct position).  
  This reveals:  
  - The second letter is **R**.  
  - The fifth letter is **E**.  
  - C, A, and N are not in the word.  
  - The word pattern is: _ R _ _ E.

- **Guess 2: ""write""** → Feedback: W (absent), R (correct position), I (correct position), T (absent), E (correct position).  
  This adds:  
  - The third letter is **I**.  
  - W and T are not in the word.  
  - The updated pattern is: _ R I _ E.  
  - Absent letters so far: C, A, N, W, T.

### Current Knowledge:
- **Pattern:** The secret word is of the form `[letter1] R I [letter4] E`.
- **Correct and fixed letters:** 
  - Position 2: R
  - Position 3: I
  - Position 5: E
- **Absent letters:** C, A, N, W, T (these cannot appear anywhere in the word).
- **Unknown positions:** Only positions 1 and 4 need to be determined.
- **Possible letters for positions 1 and 4:** Any letter not in the absent list (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, S, U, V, Y, etc.).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- We need to test common letters for positions 1 and 4 to solve the word quickly. 
- Ideal candidates should:
  - Fit the pattern `_ R I _ E`.
  - Use new, common letters to maximize information (e.g., test letters like P, D, S, G, B).
  - Avoid absent letters (C, A, N, W, T).
- After evaluating words like ""pride"" (tests P and D), ""bride"" (tests B and D), ""grime"" (tests G and M), or ""drive"" (tests D and V), I selected **""pride""** because:
  - It tests two new common letters: **P** (position 1) and **D** (position 4).
  - It is a valid English word and fits the pattern.
  - If P or D are correct, we get direct positional feedback. If not, we learn they are absent, narrowing down possibilities for future guesses.

<guess>pride</guess>",pride,"We have feedback from two guesses:

- W: absent (x) -> so W is not in the word
- R: correct position (✓) -> already known

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,drive,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the fifth letter)

Therefore, we know:
- The second letter is R.
- The fifth letter is E.
- The letters C, A, and N are not in the word.

We must avoid using C, A, and N in our next guess.

We also know that the word has the form: _ R _ _ E

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that fits this pattern and does not contain C, A, or N.

Let's think of words that have R in the second position and E at the end.

Common patterns: 
- The first letter can be any consonant or vowel except C, A, N (and we should avoid using letters we know are absent, but we don't have more info yet).
- Similarly, the third and fourth letters are unknown.

We should try to use a word that includes other common letters to test more possibilities.

Common letters in English: E, T, O, I, S, R, etc. (but R and E are already known and in place).

We can try to use a word that has T, O, I, S, L, etc.

Let me list some words that fit _ R _ _ E:

Possible words:
- TRADE (but A is absent, so not allowed because A is not in the word)
- BRIDE (B, R, I, D, E) -> B is not forbidden, I and D are new.
- GRIME (G, R, I, M, E)
- PRICE (but C is absent, so invalid)
- WRITE (W, R, I, T, E)
- FRISE (F, R, I, S, E) - but is it a word? (Frise is a valid word, meaning an architectural ornament)

But note: we must avoid A, C, N.

Let me check the feedback again: we have two correct letters: R and E in positions 2 and 5.

We also know that C, A, N are absent.

So, for the next guess, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Possible candidates:
- ""BRINE"" but N is absent, so invalid.
- ""TRICE"" but C is absent.
- ""DRIVE"" (D, R, I, V, E) -> V is a less common letter, but it's acceptable.

Alternatively, we can try:
- ""ROUSE"" (R, O, U, S, E) but R is in the first position? No, we need R in the second. ""ROUSE"" has R as the first letter, so it doesn't fit.

We need the second letter to be R and the fifth to be E.

So, let's think of words that start with any letter (except C, A, N) then R, then any three letters (except C, A, N) and end with E.

Examples:
- BRUTE (B, R, U, T, E)
- GRAPE (but A is absent) -> invalid
- PRUNE (but N and U? N is absent) -> invalid
- TRIPE (T, R, I, P, E)
- WRITE (W, R, I, T, E)
- FRISE (F, R, I, S, E) - if accepted.

But we also want to cover common letters. Since we have two letters fixed, we can test three new letters.

I think ""WRITE"" is a good candidate: it uses W, I, T which are common, and we avoid the forbidden letters.

Another option: ""BRIDE"" (B, R, I, D, E) - tests B, I, D.

But note: we have E already in the fifth position, so we don't need to test E again, but it's fixed.

We can also consider ""PRIDE"" (P, R, I, D, E) - but P is less common.

Alternatively, ""TRITE"" (T, R, I, T, E) - but it has two T's, which might be useful if T is in the word.

But let's choose a word that maximizes new information.

I'll go with ""WRITE"": 
- W is a new letter in position 1.
- I is in position 3.
- T is in position 4.

If we get feedback, we can learn about W, I, T.

Another common word: ""ROGUE"" but R is in the first position? No, we need R in second. ""R"" must be the second letter, so the word must be of the form: [letter] R [letter] [letter] E.

""ROGUE"" is R first, then O, then G, then U, then E -> so it doesn't have R in the second position.

Similarly, ""URINE"" has U, R, I, N, E -> but N is absent, so invalid.

""CRIME"" has C, which is absent.

So, ""WRITE"" seems good.

But let me check if there's a word that uses S, which is very common. For example, ""ARISE"" but A is absent and R is in the first position? ""ARISE"" is A (absent) and R is second? Actually, ""ARISE"": A (1st), R (2nd), I (3rd), S (4th), E (5th). But A is absent, so we cannot use it.

""PRISE"" (P, R, I, S, E) - meaning to force open. That's a valid word.

""RISE"" is only 4 letters.

So, ""PRISE"" is an option.

But I think ""WRITE"" is more common.

Alternatively, ""TRICE"" is invalid because of C.

Another word: ""BRINE"" has N, which is absent.

So, between ""WRITE"" and ""PRISE"", I think both are acceptable.

But ""PRISE"" uses P and S, and ""WRITE"" uses W and T.

Since T is more common than P, I'll go with ""WRITE"".

But note: we have two fixed letters (R and E) and we are testing three new letters. We have 6 tries, so it's okay.

We can also consider ""DRIVE"" (D, R, I, V, E) - V is less common, but it's a valid word.

I think ""WRITE"" is a good choice.

So, my next guess is ""WRITE"".

But let me confirm: 
- W in position 1: if it's correct, we get a check; if not, we know it's absent or misplaced.
- I in position 3: same.
- T in position 4: same.

We avoid C, A, N.

Therefore, I'll guess ""WRITE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and N are not in the word (marked with ""x"").
- R is in the correct second position (marked with ""✓"").
- E is in the correct fifth position (marked with ""✓"").

This means the secret word has the pattern: _ R _ _ E, and it does not contain C, A, or N.

For the next guess:
- The word must be 5 letters, valid, and avoid using C, A, or N.
- To maximize information, I should test new common letters (e.g., T, I, S, L, O) in the unknown positions (1st, 3rd, and 4th).
- ""WRITE"" fits the pattern (_ R _ _ E), avoids forbidden letters, and tests new common letters (W, I, T).

<guess>write</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: write -> FEEDBACK: W(x) R(✓) I(✓) T(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: absent (x)
- R: correct position (✓) -> so the second letter is R
- A: absent (x)
- N: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓) -> so the fifth letter is E

Thus, the word has the pattern: _ R _ _ E, and the letters C, A, N are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""write""
- W: absent (x) -> so W is not in the word
- R: correct position (✓) -> already known
- I: correct position (✓) -> so the third letter is I
- T: absent (x) -> so T is not in the word
- E: correct position (✓) -> already known

Now we know:
- The word pattern is: _ R I _ E
- Absent letters: C, A, N, W, T
- Correct letters: R (position 2), I (position 3), E (position 5)

So the word is of the form: [letter] R I [letter] E, and the missing letters are the first and fourth positions.

We also know that the word does not contain: C, A, N, W, T.

We need to find a word that fits: ? R I ? E, and the two missing letters must be from the remaining alphabet (excluding the absent letters).

Remaining common letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, X, Y, Z.

But we should focus on common letters to form valid words.

Possible words:
- The first position: can be any consonant or vowel (except A, E, I, O, U? but E and I are already used, but they can repeat? The feedback doesn't indicate that letters can't repeat, but in Wordle, words can have repeated letters. However, in the feedback so far, we haven't seen any repetition, and the absent letters are marked as absent, so if a letter is repeated, it might be shown differently. But in this case, we don't have any indication of repetition yet.

But note: in ""crane"", E was at the end and correct, and in ""write"", E is again at the end and correct. But that doesn't tell us about repetition elsewhere.

We must consider that the word might have repeated letters, but we have no evidence so far.

Given the pattern ? R I ? E, let's think of common words.

Common words that fit:
- ""PRIDE"": P R I D E -> but we have to check if P and D are allowed. P is not in the absent list, D is not either. But we have to see if it fits the feedback.
- ""BRIDE"": B R I D E -> similarly, B and D are allowed.
- ""GRIME"": G R I M E -> G and M are allowed.
- ""DRIVE"": D R I V E -> D and V are allowed.
- ""FRISE"": F R I S E -> F and S are allowed.

But we have to make a guess that tests new letters.

We know that the first letter is missing and the fourth letter is missing.

We also know that the word must be valid.

But note: we have only 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We have two letters to determine.

We can try to guess a word that uses common letters for the first and fourth positions to maximize the chance of getting it right or getting more information.

Alternatively, since we have two positions open, we might get it in this guess.

But let's see the feedback: we have three letters correct and in position: R, I, E. So we only need to find the first and fourth letters.

We can list the possible letters for the first position and fourth position.

First position: can be any letter except the absent ones (C, A, N, W, T) and also except the ones we know (R, I, E) because if they were in the first position, they would have been revealed? Not necessarily, because in ""crane"", we only tested E at the end, not at the beginning. Similarly, I was tested in the third position, not in the first.

But we know that the first letter is not W (from ""write"" feedback: W absent), and not C, A, N, T.

Similarly, the fourth letter: we know it's not T (from ""write"" feedback: T absent), and not C, A, N, W.

So possible first letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, X, Y, Z.

But we should consider common letters: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, S, U.

Similarly for the fourth letter: same set, but note that it could be a vowel or consonant.

Common words:
- PRIDE: P and D
- BRIDE: B and D
- GRIME: G and M
- DRIVE: D and V
- FRISE: F and S
- ORATE: but O and A? A is absent, so invalid.
- URINE: U and N? N is absent, invalid.
- TRIBE: T is absent, invalid.
- CRIME: C absent, invalid.

So we have a few candidates: PRIDE, BRIDE, GRIME, DRIVE, FRISE.

We need to choose one that tests letters we haven't tried yet.

We have not tested: B, D, F, G, M, P, S, V, etc.

In ""crane"" we tested: C, R, A, N, E
In ""write"" we tested: W, R, I, T, E

So the new letters we can test are: B, D, F, G, M, P, S, V, and others.

If we guess ""PRIDE"", we test P and D.
If we guess ""BRIDE"", we test B and D.
If we guess ""GRIME"", we test G and M.
If we guess ""DRIVE"", we test D and V (but D is repeated in testing if we choose multiple, but we can only choose one).

We are on the third guess, so we can try to cover more ground.

But note: if we guess a word that has one of the possibilities, we might get it right.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses two new letters that are common.

I think ""PRIDE"" is a good candidate because P and D are common.

But let me see if there is a word that uses S, which is very common. ""FRISE"" is a word, but it's less common. ""RISE"" is only 4 letters.

Another word: ""BRINE"" but N is absent, invalid.

""PRICE"" but C absent.

""TRIPE"" but T absent.

So, among the options, ""PRIDE"" and ""BRIDE"" are common.

But we have to avoid using letters that might be absent. We don't know about B, D, P, etc.

I think I'll go with ""PRIDE"" to test P and D.

If we guess ""PRIDE"":
- If P is correct in the first position, we get a check; if not, we know it's absent or misplaced (but since it's the first position, if absent, then we know P is not in the word).
- Similarly, D in the fourth position: if correct, check; if not, then D is absent or misplaced.

But note: if D is not in the fourth position, it might be in another position? But the only positions left are the first and fourth, and we are putting D in the fourth. If D is in the word but not in the fourth, it would be marked with '-' for wrong position. But in this pattern, the only unknown positions are first and fourth, so if D is in the word, it must be in the fourth position or not at all? Not necessarily, because if the word has two D's, but we don't know. But we haven't seen D in any feedback, so it's possible.

But to keep it simple, let's guess ""PRIDE"".

Alternatively, we can guess ""BRIDE"" to test B and D.

But I think ""PRIDE"" is fine.

Another common word: ""GRIPE"" but G R I P E -> that fits the pattern. And P is tested again? But we haven't tested P or G.

""GRIPE"": G in first, P in fourth.

Similarly, ""PRIDE"" has P in first and D in fourth.

I think both are good.

But let's choose one.

I'll go with ""PRIDE"".

So, the guess is ""PRIDE"".

But let me confirm the pattern: P R I D E -> positions: 1:P, 2:R, 3:I, 4:D, 5:E. That matches _ R I _ E.

And it avoids the absent letters.

So, <guess>pride</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C (absent), R (correct position), A (absent), N (absent), E (correct position).  
  This reveals:  
  - The second letter is **R**.  
  - The fifth letter is **E**.  
  - C, A, and N are not in the word.  
  - The word pattern is: _ R _ _ E.

- **Guess 2: ""write""** → Feedback: W (absent), R (correct position), I (correct position), T (absent), E (correct position).  
  This adds:  
  - The third letter is **I**.  
  - W and T are not in the word.  
  - The updated pattern is: _ R I _ E.  
  - Absent letters so far: C, A, N, W, T.

### Current Knowledge:
- **Pattern:** The secret word is of the form `[letter1] R I [letter4] E`.
- **Correct and fixed letters:** 
  - Position 2: R
  - Position 3: I
  - Position 5: E
- **Absent letters:** C, A, N, W, T (these cannot appear anywhere in the word).
- **Unknown positions:** Only positions 1 and 4 need to be determined.
- **Possible letters for positions 1 and 4:** Any letter not in the absent list (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, S, U, V, Y, etc.).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- We need to test common letters for positions 1 and 4 to solve the word quickly. 
- Ideal candidates should:
  - Fit the pattern `_ R I _ E`.
  - Use new, common letters to maximize information (e.g., test letters like P, D, S, G, B).
  - Avoid absent letters (C, A, N, W, T).
- After evaluating words like ""pride"" (tests P and D), ""bride"" (tests B and D), ""grime"" (tests G and M), or ""drive"" (tests D and V), I selected **""pride""** because:
  - It tests two new common letters: **P** (position 1) and **D** (position 4).
  - It is a valid English word and fits the pattern.
  - If P or D are correct, we get direct positional feedback. If not, we learn they are absent, narrowing down possibilities for future guesses.

We have 6 tries, so it\'s okay.\n\nWe can also consider ""DRIVE"" (D, R, I, V, E) - V is less common, but it\'s a valid word.\n\nI think ""WRITE"" is a good choice.\n\nSo, my next guess is ""WRITE"".\n\nBut let me confirm: \n- W in position 1: if it\'s correct, we get a check; if not, we know it\'s absent or misplaced.\n- I in position 3: same.\n- T in position 4: same.\n\nWe avoid C, A, N.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll guess ""WRITE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, A, and N are not in the word (marked with ""x"").\n- R is in the correct second position (marked with ""✓"").\n- E is in the correct fifth position (marked with ""✓"").\n\nThis means the secret word has the pattern: _ R _ _ E, and it does not contain C, A, or N.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- The word must be 5 letters, valid, and avoid using C, A, or N.\n- To maximize information, I should test new common letters (e.g., T, I, S, L, O) in the unknown positions (1st, 3rd, and 4th).\n- ""WRITE"" fits the pattern (_ R _ _ E), avoids forbidden letters, and tests new common letters (W, I, T).\n\n<guess>write</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: write -> FEEDBACK: W(x) R(✓) I(✓) T(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: absent (x)\n- R: correct position (✓) -> so the second letter is R\n- A: absent (x)\n- N: absent (x)\n- E: correct position (✓) -> so the fifth letter is E\n\nThus, the word has the pattern: _ R _ _ E, and the letters C, A, N are not in the word.\n\nGuess 2: ""write""\n- W: absent (x) -> so W is not in the word\n- R: correct position (✓) -> already known\n- I: correct position (✓) -> so the third letter is I\n- T: absent (x) -> so T is not in the word\n- E: correct position (✓) -> already known\n\nNow we know:\n- The word pattern is: _ R I _ E\n- Absent letters: C, A, N, W, T\n- Correct letters: R (position 2), I (position 3), E (position 5)\n\nSo the word is of the form: [letter] R I [letter] E, and the missing letters are the first and fourth positions.\n\nWe also know that the word does not contain: C, A, N, W, T.\n\nWe need to find a word that fits: ? R I ? E, and the two missing letters must be from the remaining alphabet (excluding the absent letters).\n\nRemaining common letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we should focus on common letters to form valid words.\n\nPossible words:\n- The first position: can be any consonant or vowel (except A, E, I, O, U? but E and I are already used, but they can repeat? The feedback doesn\'t indicate that letters can\'t repeat, but in Wordle, words can have repeated letters. However, in the feedback so far, we haven\'t seen any repetition, and the absent letters are marked as absent, so if a letter is repeated, it might be shown differently. But in this case, we don\'t have any indication of repetition yet.\n\nBut note: in ""crane"", E was at the end and correct, and in ""write"", E is again at the end and correct. But that doesn\'t tell us about repetition elsewhere.\n\nWe must consider that the word might have repeated letters, but we have no evidence so far.\n\nGiven the pattern ? R I ? E, let\'s think of common words.\n\nCommon words that fit:\n- ""PRIDE"": P R I D E -> but we have to check if P and D are allowed. P is not in the absent list, D is not either. But we have to see if it fits the feedback.\n- ""BRIDE"": B R I D E -> similarly, B and D are allowed.\n- ""GRIME"": G R I M E -> G and M are allowed.\n- ""DRIVE"": D R I V E -> D and V are allowed.\n- ""FRISE"": F R I S E -> F and S are allowed.\n\nBut we have to make a guess that tests new letters.\n\nWe know that the first letter is missing and the fourth letter is missing.\n\nWe also know that the word must be valid.\n\nBut note: we have only 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We have two letters to determine.\n\nWe can try to guess a word that uses common letters for the first and fourth positions to maximize the chance of getting it right or getting more information.\n\nAlternatively, since we have two positions open, we might get it in this guess.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback: we have three letters correct and in position: R, I, E. So we only need to find the first and fourth letters.\n\nWe can list the possible letters for the first position and fourth position.\n\nFirst position: can be any letter except the absent ones (C, A, N, W, T) and also except the ones we know (R, I, E) because if they were in the first position, they would have been revealed? Not necessarily, because in ""crane"", we only tested E at the end, not at the beginning. Similarly, I was tested in the third position, not in the first.\n\nBut we know that the first letter is not W (from ""write"" feedback: W absent), and not C, A, N, T.\n\nSimilarly, the fourth letter: we know it\'s not T (from ""write"" feedback: T absent), and not C, A, N, W.\n\nSo possible first letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we should consider common letters: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, S, U.\n\nSimilarly for the fourth letter: same set, but note that it could be a vowel or consonant.\n\nCommon words:\n- PRIDE: P and D\n- BRIDE: B and D\n- GRIME: G and M\n- DRIVE: D and V\n- FRISE: F and S\n- ORATE: but O and A? A is absent, so invalid.\n- URINE: U and N? N is absent, invalid.\n- TRIBE: T is absent, invalid.\n- CRIME: C absent, invalid.\n\nSo we have a few candidates: PRIDE, BRIDE, GRIME, DRIVE, FRISE.\n\nWe need to choose one that tests letters we haven\'t tried yet.\n\nWe have not tested: B, D, F, G, M, P, S, V, etc.\n\nIn ""crane"" we tested: C, R, A, N, E\nIn ""write"" we tested: W, R, I, T, E\n\nSo the new letters we can test are: B, D, F, G, M, P, S, V, and others.\n\nIf we guess ""PRIDE"", we test P and D.\nIf we guess ""BRIDE"", we test B and D.\nIf we guess ""GRIME"", we test G and M.\nIf we guess ""DRIVE"", we test D and V (but D is repeated in testing if we choose multiple, but we can only choose one).\n\nWe are on the third guess, so we can try to cover more ground.\n\nBut note: if we guess a word that has one of the possibilities, we might get it right.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that uses two new letters that are common.\n\nI think ""PRIDE"" is a good candidate because P and D are common.\n\nBut let me see if there is a word that uses S, which is very common. ""FRISE"" is a word, but it\'s less common. ""RISE"" is only 4 letters.\n\nAnother word: ""BRINE"" but N is absent, invalid.\n\n""PRICE"" but C absent.\n\n""TRIPE"" but T absent.\n\nSo, among the options, ""PRIDE"" and ""BRIDE"" are common.\n\nBut we have to avoid using letters that might be absent. We don\'t know about B, D, P, etc.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""PRIDE"" to test P and D.\n\nIf we guess ""PRIDE"":\n- If P is correct in the first position, we get a check; if not, we know it\'s absent or misplaced (but since it\'s the first position, if absent, then we know P is not in the word).\n- Similarly, D in the fourth position: if correct, check; if not, then D is absent or misplaced.\n\nBut note: if D is not in the fourth position, it might be in another position? But the only positions left are the first and fourth, and we are putting D in the fourth. If D is in the word but not in the fourth, it would be marked with \'-\' for wrong position. But in this pattern, the only unknown positions are first and fourth, so if D is in the word, it must be in the fourth position or not at all? Not necessarily, because if the word has two D\'s, but we don\'t know. But we haven\'t seen D in any feedback, so it\'s possible.\n\nBut to keep it simple, let\'s guess ""PRIDE"".\n\nAlternatively, we can guess ""BRIDE"" to test B and D.\n\nBut I think ""PRIDE"" is fine.\n\nAnother common word: ""GRIPE"" but G R I P E -> that fits the pattern. And P is tested again? But we haven\'t tested P or G.\n\n""GRIPE"": G in first, P in fourth.\n\nSimilarly, ""PRIDE"" has P in first and D in fourth.\n\nI think both are good.\n\nBut let\'s choose one.\n\nI\'ll go with ""PRIDE"".\n\nSo, the guess is ""PRIDE"".\n\nBut let me confirm the pattern: P R I D E -> positions: 1:P, 2:R, 3:I, 4:D, 5:E. That matches _ R I _ E.\n\nAnd it avoids the absent letters.\n\nSo, <guess>pride</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C (absent), R (correct position), A (absent), N (absent), E (correct position).  \n  This reveals:  \n  - The second letter is **R**.  \n  - The fifth letter is **E**.  \n  - C, A, and N are not in the word.  \n  - The word pattern is: _ R _ _ E.\n\n- **Guess 2: ""write""** → Feedback: W (absent), R (correct position), I (correct position), T (absent), E (correct position).  \n  This adds:  \n  - The third letter is **I**.  \n  - W and T are not in the word.  \n  - The updated pattern is: _ R I _ E.  \n  - Absent letters so far: C, A, N, W, T.\n\n### Current Knowledge:\n- **Pattern:** The secret word is of the form `[letter1] R I [letter4] E`.\n- **Correct and fixed letters:** \n  - Position 2: R\n  - Position 3: I\n  - Position 5: E\n- **Absent letters:** C, A, N, W, T (these cannot appear anywhere in the word).\n- **Unknown positions:** Only positions 1 and 4 need to be determined.\n- **Possible letters for positions 1 and 4:** Any letter not in the absent list (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, S, U, V, Y, etc.).\n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- We need to test common letters for positions 1 and 4 to solve the word quickly. \n- Ideal candidates should:\n  - Fit the pattern `_ R I _ E`.\n  - Use new, common letters to maximize information (e.g., test letters like P, D, S, G, B).\n  - Avoid absent letters (C, A, N, W, T).\n- After evaluating words like ""pride"" (tests P and D), ""bride"" (tests B and D), ""grime"" (tests G and M), or ""drive"" (tests D and V), I selected **""pride""** because:\n  - It tests two new common letters: **P** (position 1) and **D** (position 4).\n  - It is a valid English word and fits the pattern.\n  - If P or D are correct, we get direct positional feedback.

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: absent
- R: correct position (2nd letter)
- A: absent
- N: absent
- E: correct position (5th letter)

Guess 2: ""write""
- W: absent
- R: correct position (2nd letter, already known)
- I: correct position (3rd letter)
- T: absent
- E: correct position (5th letter, already known)

From these, we know:
- The word pattern is _ R I _ E
- Absent letters: C, A, N, W, T

Guess 3: ""pride"" (our last guess)
- P: absent (x) -> so P is not in the word
- R: correct position (✓) -> expected, as it's fixed
- I: correct position (✓) -> expected
- D: present but wrong position (-) -> so D is in the word, but not in the 4th position
- E: correct position (✓) -> expected

New information:
- P is absent (cannot be P)
- D is in the word but not in the 4th position.

Since the word pattern is _ R I _ E, and D is somewhere in the word but not in the 4th position, and the only unknown positions are 1 and 4, D must be in position 1? Because:
- Position 2 is R (fixed)
- Position 3 is I (fixed)
- Position 5 is E (fixed)
- Position 4 is the only other unknown, but D is not there, so D must be in position 1.

The pattern is: position 1 (unknown), pos2=R, pos3=I, pos4 (unknown), pos5=E.

D is in the word but not in position 4. Since positions 2,3,5 are fixed and cannot be D (because R, I, E are different letters), D must be in position 1.

Therefore, the first letter must be D.

So, the word should be D R I _ E.

But in the feedback for ""pride"", D is marked as present but wrong position. In ""pride"", D was in position 4. Since the secret word has D, but not in position 4, and position 1 is the only place it can be, then it should be D in position 1.

Therefore, the word is of the form: D R I ? E

Now, we need the fourth letter.

We also know that the letter cannot be C, A, N, W, T, P (all absent), and cannot be D (because D is already in position 1, and we don't know if repetition is allowed, but typically words can have repeated letters? However, if D is in the first position, then in ""pride"", D was guessed in position 4, which would be wrong position. But if the word has only one D, and it's in position 1, then position 4 isn't D. There could be two D's? But let's see.

Since the secret word has D in it (confirmed by the feedback), and we now believe it's in position 1, then for position 4, we need a letter that is not C, A, N, W, T, P, and not R, I, E (since those are fixed), but it could be D? But if the word has two D's, then D in position 4 would be possible, but in the feedback, D was marked with '-', meaning wrong position, so if D were in the word twice, and we guessed it in position 4, but it was also in position 1, then the feedback would show D as '-' only for position 4 if it's not there, but it might also show that D is present. However, since we got '-' for D, it means that in the secret word, there is a D, but not in position 4. So if there were a D in position 1, then that is separate.

But in the pattern D R I ? E, if we put ? as D, the word would be D R I D E. Is ""dride"" a word? I don't think so. Common words ending with ""E"" after R I are like ""drive"", ""bride"", etc.

The feedback tells us D is not in position 4, so for the secret word, position 4 cannot be D. Therefore, the fourth letter is not D, and since D is in the word, it must be in position 1.

So the word is D R I ? E, where ? is not D, and not any of the absent letters.

Absent letters: C, A, N, W, T, P

So possible letters for position 4: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, S, U, V, X, Y, Z.

Now, common words: 
- ""drive"": D R I V E -> V in position 4.
- ""bride"": B R I D E, but D is in position 4, and we know D is not in position 4? Wait, no: in ""bride"", D is in position 4, but our word must be D R I ? E, so the first letter is D, so ""bride"" wouldn't work because it starts with B.

The word must start with D.

So, words like ""drive"" (D R I V E), ""drip e""? No, ""dripe"" not a word.

Common words: ""drive"" is one option.

Is there another? ""drice"" not a word, etc.

""drie"" is not 5 letters.

""drille"" is 6 letters.

So, ""drive"" seems a likely candidate.

Other possibilities: 
- ""drite"" but T is absent? T is absent, so not allowed.
- ""drine"" N absent? No.
- ""drise"" S in fourth position? Is ""drise"" a word? Not common; ""arise"" without A? Not.
- ""drice"" C absent, and not a word.
- ""drime"" not standard; perhaps ""grime"" is a word but with G.

But we need the word to be common English.

""Drive"" is a valid word.

In ""drive"": D in first, V in fourth.

We haven't tested V.

If we guess ""drive"", we can confirm.

Since we have only 6 tries, and we might get it right.

But we could also consider if there are other options.

Another word: ""druid"" but that ends with D, not E. Pattern requires E at the end.

So, ""drive"" seems the most common.

""Drope"" D R O P E, but O? And pattern requires I in third? No, we have I fixed in third.

Therefore, the only common word that fits is ""drive"".

But let me confirm: D R I V E -> positions: 1:D, 2:R, 3:I, 4:V, 5:E.

This matches.

We also have D present and in position 1? Yes, and V is new.

In the previous feedback, for ""pride"", D was marked as present but wrong position. Now we are moving D to position 1, which should be correct.

And V is untested.

So, we can guess ""drive"" and hope it's correct.

If not, we get feedback on V.

But since there are few options, I think ""drive"" is the best guess.

Is there another word? ""dwine"" but W is absent? W is absent, so no.

""drone"" N absent? N absent, and O in fourth? But pattern must have I in third, so not.

So ""drive"" seems the only common word.

Therefore, I will guess ""drive"".

Summary:
- We deduced that D must be the first letter because it couldn't be in the fourth and the other positions are fixed with different letters.
- The fourth letter must be something else; ""V"" in ""drive"" is plausible because it's a common word.

So, <guess>drive</guess>

### Analysis of Previous Feedback

#### Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
- **R** is in the word and correctly placed at position 2.
- **E** is in the word and correctly placed at position 5.
- **C, A, N** are absent from the word.
- Secret word pattern: `_ R _ _ E`.

#### Guess 2: ""write"" → Feedback: W(x) R(✓) I(✓) T(x) E(✓)
- **R** (position 2) and **E** (position 5) remain correct (known).
- **I** is in the word and correctly placed at position 3.
- **W and T** are absent.
- Updated secret word pattern: `_ R I _ E`.
- Absent letters: **C, A, N, W, T**.

#### Guess 3: ""pride"" → Feedback: P(x) R(✓) I(✓) D(-) E(✓)
- **R** (position 2), **I** (position 3), and **E** (position 5) remain correct (known).
- **P** is absent.
- **D** is present but in the wrong position (cannot be at position 4).
- Absent letters updated: **C, A, N, W, T, P**.

### Key Inferences:
1. Secret word pattern: `[unknown1] R I [unknown4] E`.
2. **D** must be in the word (per `D(-)` feedback), but not at position 4. The only possible position for **D** is position 1 because:
   - Positions 2, 3, and 5 are fixed as **R**, **I**, and **E** (which are unique and different from **D**).
   - Position 4 is explicitly incorrect for **D** (feedback showed `-`).
   - Thus, **D** must occupy position 1.
3. Updated pattern: `D R I [unknown4] E`.
4. **Unknown4** must be a letter not in the absent list (**C, A, N, W, T, P**) and not **D** (since position 4 cannot be **D**, per feedback).
5. Common English words fitting `D R I _ E`:
   - ""drife"" (not a valid word).
   - ""drite"" (not valid, and **T** absent).
   - ""drice"" (not valid, and **C** absent).
   - **""drive""**: Valid, and **V** is not in the absent list. This is a strong candidate.
   - Other possibilities like ""drise"" or ""drine"" are invalid or contain absent letters.
6. Conclusion: ""drive"" is the most plausible valid word. Guessing it tests **V** and likely solves the game.

<guess>drive</guess>",drive,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: absent
- R: correct position (2nd letter)
- A: absent
- N: absent
- E: correct position (5th letter)

Guess 2: ""write""
- W: absent
- R: correct position (2nd letter, already known)
- I: correct position (3rd letter)
- T: absent
- E: correct position (5th letter, already known)

From these, we know:
- The word pattern is _ R I _ E
- Absent letters: C, A, N, W, T

Guess 3: ""pride"" (our last guess)
- P: absent (x) -> so P is not in the word
- R: correct position (✓) -> expected, as it's fixed
- I: correct position (✓) -> expected
- D: present but wrong position (-) -> so D is in the word, but not in the 4th position
- E: correct position (✓) -> expected

New information:
- P is absent (cannot be P)
- D is in the word but not in the 4th position.

Since the word pattern is _ R I _ E, and D is somewhere in the word but not in the 4th position, and the only unknown positions are 1 and 4, D must be in position 1? Because:
- Position 2 is R (fixed)
- Position 3 is I (fixed)
- Position 5 is E (fixed)
- Position 4 is the only other unknown, but D is not there, so D must be in position 1.

The pattern is: position 1 (unknown), pos2=R, pos3=I, pos4 (unknown), pos5=E.

D is in the word but not in position 4. Since positions 2,3,5 are fixed and cannot be D (because R, I, E are different letters), D must be in position 1.

Therefore, the first letter must be D.

So, the word should be D R I _ E.

But in the feedback for ""pride"", D is marked as present but wrong position. In ""pride"", D was in position 4. Since the secret word has D, but not in position 4, and position 1 is the only place it can be, then it should be D in position 1.

Therefore, the word is of the form: D R I ? E

Now, we need the fourth letter.

We also know that the letter cannot be C, A, N, W, T, P (all absent), and cannot be D (because D is already in position 1, and we don't know if repetition is allowed, but typically words can have repeated letters? However, if D is in the first position, then in ""pride"", D was guessed in position 4, which would be wrong position. But if the word has only one D, and it's in position 1, then position 4 isn't D. There could be two D's? But let's see.

Since the secret word has D in it (confirmed by the feedback), and we now believe it's in position 1, then for position 4, we need a letter that is not C, A, N, W, T, P, and not R, I, E (since those are fixed), but it could be D?

However, since we got '-' for D, it means that in the secret word, there is a D, but not in position 4. So if there were a D in position 1, then that is separate.

But in the pattern D R I ? E, if we put ? as D, the word would be D R I D E. Is ""dride"" a word? I don't think so. Common words ending with ""E"" after R I are like ""drive"", ""bride"", etc.

The feedback tells us D is not in position 4, so for the secret word, position 4 cannot be D. Therefore, the fourth letter is not D, and since D is in the word, it must be in position 1.

So the word is D R I ? E, where ? is not D, and not any of the absent letters.

Absent letters: C, A, N, W, T, P

So possible letters for position 4: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, S, U, V, X, Y, Z.

Now, common words: 
- ""drive"": D R I V E -> V in position 4.
- ""bride"": B R I D E, but D is in position 4, and we know D is not in position 4? Wait, no: in ""bride"", D is in position 4, but our word must be D R I ? E, so the first letter is D, so ""bride"" wouldn't work because it starts with B.

The word must start with D.

So, words like ""drive"" (D R I V E), ""drip e""? No, ""dripe"" not a word.

Common words: ""drive"" is one option.

Is there another? ""drice"" not a word, etc.

""drie"" is not 5 letters.

""drille"" is 6 letters.

So, ""drive"" seems a likely candidate.

Other possibilities: 
- ""drite"" but T is absent? T is absent, so not allowed.
- ""drine"" N absent? No.
- ""drise"" S in fourth position? Is ""drise"" a word? Not common; ""arise"" without A? Not.
- ""drice"" C absent, and not a word.
- ""drime"" not standard; perhaps ""grime"" is a word but with G.

But we need the word to be common English.

""Drive"" is a valid word.

In ""drive"": D in first, V in fourth.

We haven't tested V.

If we guess ""drive"", we can confirm.

Since we have only 6 tries, and we might get it right.

But we could also consider if there are other options.

Another word: ""druid"" but that ends with D, not E. Pattern requires E at the end.

So, ""drive"" seems the most common.

""Drope"" D R O P E, but O? And pattern requires I in third? No, we have I fixed in third.

Therefore, the only common word that fits is ""drive"".

But let me confirm: D R I V E -> positions: 1:D, 2:R, 3:I, 4:V, 5:E.

This matches.

We also have D present and in position 1? Yes, and V is new.

In the previous feedback, for ""pride"", D was marked as present but wrong position. Now we are moving D to position 1, which should be correct.

And V is untested.

So, we can guess ""drive"" and hope it's correct.

If not, we get feedback on V.

But since there are few options, I think ""drive"" is the best guess.

Is there another word? ""dwine"" but W is absent? W is absent, so no.

""drone"" N absent? N absent, and O in fourth? But pattern must have I in third, so not.

So ""drive"" seems the only common word.

Therefore, I will guess ""drive"".

Summary:
- We deduced that D must be the first letter because it couldn't be in the fourth and the other positions are fixed with different letters.
- The fourth letter must be something else; ""V"" in ""drive"" is plausible because it's a common word.

So, <guess>drive</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback

#### Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
- **R** is in the word and correctly placed at position 2.
- **E** is in the word and correctly placed at position 5.
- **C, A, N** are absent from the word.
- Secret word pattern: `_ R _ _ E`.

#### Guess 2: ""write"" → Feedback: W(x) R(✓) I(✓) T(x) E(✓)
- **R** (position 2) and **E** (position 5) remain correct (known).
- **I** is in the word and correctly placed at position 3.
- **W and T** are absent.
- Updated secret word pattern: `_ R I _ E`.
- Absent letters: **C, A, N, W, T**.

#### Guess 3: ""pride"" → Feedback: P(x) R(✓) I(✓) D(-) E(✓)
- **R** (position 2), **I** (position 3), and **E** (position 5) remain correct (known).
- **P** is absent.
- **D** is present but in the wrong position (cannot be at position 4).
- Absent letters updated: **C, A, N, W, T, P**.

### Key Inferences:
1. Secret word pattern: `[unknown1] R I [unknown4] E`.
2. **D** must be in the word (per `D(-)` feedback), but not at position 4. The only possible position for **D** is position 1 because:
   - Positions 2, 3, and 5 are fixed as **R**, **I**, and **E** (which are unique and different from **D**).
   - Position 4 is explicitly incorrect for **D** (feedback showed `-`).
   - Thus, **D** must occupy position 1.
3. Updated pattern: `D R I [unknown4] E`.
4. **Unknown4** must be a letter not in the absent list (**C, A, N, W, T, P**) and not **D** (since position 4 cannot be **D**, per feedback).
5. Common English words fitting `D R I _ E`:
   - ""drife"" (not a valid word).
   - ""drite"" (not valid, and **T** absent).
   - ""drice"" (not valid, and **C** absent).
   - **""drive""**: Valid, and **V** is not in the absent list. This is a strong candidate.
   - Other possibilities like ""drise"" or ""drine"" are invalid or contain absent letters.
6. Conclusion: ""drive"" is the most plausible valid word. Guessing it tests **V** and likely solves the game.",Guess 4: drive -> FEEDBACK: D(✓) R(✓) I(✓) V(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
