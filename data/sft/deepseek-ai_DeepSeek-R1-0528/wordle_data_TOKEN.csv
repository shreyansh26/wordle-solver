We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it is a popular starting word. It has three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).

 So, our first guess will be: CRANE

We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: - (in the word, but wrong position)
 E: - (in the word, but wrong position)

 So, the secret word does not contain C, R, A. But it does contain N and E, but not in the positions they were guessed.
 Since ""crane"" had N at the 4th position and E at the 5th, that means in the secret word:
 - N is not in the 4th position, but it's somewhere else.
 - E is not in the 5th position, but it's somewhere else.

 We also know the secret word does not have C, R, A.

 Now, for the next guess, we should choose a word that:
 1. Does not contain C, R, A (since they are not in the word).
 2. Contains N and E (since they are in the word).
 3. Places N and E in different positions than the first guess (so not N at position 4 or E at position 5).

 Moreover, we want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Considering the feedback, let's think of a word that meets the criteria.

 Options for letters: Since we have removed C, R, A, we are left with other consonants and vowels.

 We know the secret word has N and E. Let's list possible words? That might be too many, but we can choose a word that uses common letters.

 Common consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
 Vowels: We have E (already known) and possibly others, but A is out. So vowels available: E, I, O, U (and sometimes Y).

 We also know that the word is 5 letters.

 Let's try to pick a word that includes N and E, and avoids C, R, A, and places N and E in new positions.

 Since N was in position 4 and E in position 5, we can put them in positions such as:
 N: position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but 5 was E's position? but E was at 5 and now we can try N elsewhere? Actually, we know N is not at 4, but it can be at 5? Similarly E can be at 4?).

 Let me try to form a word.

 Example: We could try ""LENS"" but that's 4 letters. We need 5.

 Possibilities: 
 - Let me try to put E at a different position, say position 3? Then N could be at position 2?

 Word: ""MINES"" -> has I, M, N, E, S. But we don't know if I, M, S are in the word? And note: E at position 5? But in our first guess E was at position 5 and now we are avoiding the same position? Actually, we are allowed to try E at position 5 again? But feedback told us E is not at position 5. So we must place E at positions 1,2,3,4? Similarly N must be placed at positions 1,2,3,5.

 We cannot put E at position 5? So we must use E in positions 1-4? Similarly, N cannot be at position 4? So N can be at positions 1,2,3,5.

 Now, we want to maximize learning other letters. So we can use letters that are common and haven't been tested.

 We also know that we must avoid C, R, A.

 Another idea: Use a word that has both E and N, and three new letters (which aren't C, R, A).

 Possible words: 
 - ""LINES"": has L, I, N, E, S. 
   Positions: N is at 3? We need to assign: 
   Let me define: position 1: L, 2: I, 3: N, 4: E, 5: S.
   But wait: N is at position 3 (which is new) and E at position 4 (also new). This seems acceptable.

 But is ""LINES"" a valid word? Yes.

 Alternatively, ""TENOR"": has T, E, N, O, R -> but R is already ruled out! So we cannot use R.

 Since R is not in the word, we must avoid R. Similarly, A and C are not in the word.

 So ""TENOR"" has R -> that's not allowed.

 Another word: ""MINCE"" -> has C? C is ruled out -> no.

 Word: ""BENCH"" -> has C: disallowed.

 How about ""STONE"": 
 - S, T, O, N, E -> positions: N at 4? But in the first guess, N was at 4 and we must avoid position 4 for N? Actually, we cannot put N at position 4? Because the feedback said N is not at position 4? So in ""STONE"", N is at position 4: that would be the same position? We are not supposed to repeat a known incorrect position? We can't use N at position 4 because we know it's not there.

 So: avoid placing N at position 4.

 ""STONE"" -> N is at position 4 -> not allowed.

 Alternative: ""SETON"" -> but that might not be common? And E is at position 2, N at position 5? That's acceptable.

 But let's think of more common words.

 Word: ""SINEW"": S, I, N, E, W.
 Positions: 
 1. S
 2. I
 3. N
 4. E
 5. W

 Notice: 
 - N is at position 3 (it was at 4 -> now changed to 3 -> new)
 - E is at position 4 (it was at 5 -> now at 4 -> new)

 This avoids the positions we know are incorrect.

 Also, the letters S, I, W haven't been tried.

 So ""SINEW"" seems a good candidate.

 Another common word: ""OPINE"": O, P, I, N, E -> 
 Positions: N at 4? But we cannot have N at position 4? So this is bad.

 Another: ""QUIET"" -> but no N? We must include N and E.

 We must include both N and E.

 Another option: ""DEIGN"": D, E, I, G, N -> 
 Positions: 
 1: D
 2: E (E was previously at 5, now at 2 -> new)
 3: I
 4: G
 5: N (N was at 4, now at 5 -> new)

 This seems acceptable: E is at 2, N at 5.

 But ""DEIGN"" is a word? Yes. Also, it tests D, I, G.

 But note: We have to use valid English words.

 Alternatively, ""BEGIN"": B, E, G, I, N -> 
 Positions: E at 2, N at 5 -> same as above? But avoids A, C, R.

 However, ""BEGIN"" uses B and G? And we haven't tried them.

 Now, comparing ""SINEW"" and ""BEGIN"": 
 ""SINEW"" has S, I, N, E, W -> S and W are new.
 ""BEGIN"" has B, E, G, I, N -> B and G are new.

 They are both fine. Which one gives more common letters? 

 Since we want to cover more common letters, let's look at frequency in English words.

 Common letters: E, T, N, ... but we know E and N are in. Then S is very common. So perhaps ""SINEW"" is better?

 Another possibility: ""OWING"" -> O, W, I, N, G -> missing E? Must have E, so no.

 Similarly, ""FEINT"": F, E, I, N, T -> 
 Positions: E at 2, N at 4? We cannot use N at 4 -> so bad? Actually, N is at 5? ""FEINT"": 
 1: F
 2: E
 3: I
 4: N -> position 4? Not allowed for N? We cannot put N at position 4.

 Let's check: the first guess was ""crane"" -> N at position 4. The secret word has N but not at position 4. So we cannot use that position.

 Therefore, ""FEINT"" would have N at position 4 -> not allowed. So skip.

 Consider ""UNITE"": U, N, I, T, E -> 
 Positions: N at position 2, E at position 5? 
 But wait: in our first guess, E was at position 5? We also cannot have E at position 5? So we cannot put E at 5? And N at 2? 
 Actually, the feedback told us E is not at position 5? So we must avoid E at position 5? 
 Similarly, we must avoid N at position 4? 

 Therefore, E must not be at 5? N must not be at 4? 

 So ""UNITE"": 
 Position 1: U 
 Position 2: N -> new
 Position 3: I
 Position 4: T
 Position 5: E -> but we cannot put E at 5? It's disallowed.

 So ""UNITE"" is not acceptable.

 Therefore, let us use ""BEGIN"": 
 Positions: 
 1: B 
 2: E (previously E at 5, now at 2 -> new)
 3: G
 4: I
 5: N (previously N at 4, now at 5 -> new)

 So ""BEGIN"" can be tried.

 Alternatively, ""SINEW"": 
 1: S
 2: I
 3: N (new)
 4: E (new)
 5: W

 Both are acceptable.

 But note: there is also the possibility that the secret word might have repeated letters? But Wordle words are usually without duplicate letters? But let's assume no duplicates for now.

 I think either ""BEGIN"" or ""SINEW"" would be fine. Let's choose ""BEGIN"" because it places E at 2 and N at 5? Alternatively, perhaps we can choose a word that also uses the letter T? T is a common letter.

 Since T is common, maybe we should include T? But then we have to avoid the known incorrect positions and include E and N.

 Word: ""TENNY""? -> duplicate N? Also, T at 1, E at 2, N at 3 and 4? Not so good.

 How about ""BEINT""? Not a common word.

 Word: ""BENTS"": but that's 5 letters? B, E, N, T, S? 
 Positions: 
 1: B
 2: E -> okay (E was at 5, now at 2: new)
 3: N -> okay (N was at 4, now at 3: new)
 4: T
 5: S

 But it has E at 2 and N at 3? Both are new positions? And includes T? Also, ""BENTS"" is a valid word (meaning: plural of bent).

 But actually, we have to avoid duplicate letters? We don't know if the word has duplicates? But typically, Wordle words do not have duplicates? So we can assume no duplicates? Then ""BENTS"" would be acceptable? However, the word ""BENTS"" is not as common? And we might want a more common word.

 Alternatively, ""STENO"": S, T, E, N, O -> 
 E at 3? 
 Positions: 
 1: S
 2: T
 3: E -> not 5th? acceptable
 4: N -> but 4th position is disallowed? We cannot put N at 4? So bad.

 Oh, so we can't put N at 4. Therefore, ""STENO"" not allowed.

 How about ""STEIN"": S, T, E, I, N -> 
 Positions: 
 1: S
 2: T
 3: E -> ok
 4: I
 5: N -> but wait: N is at 5? And we are allowed? 
 However, E is at 3? Also, N is at 5? Both positions are acceptable? Because previously N was at 4 (disallowed) and E at 5 (disallowed). Now N at 5: that's allowed? Because the issue with E at 5? But N at 5? The feedback did not say that position 5 cannot be occupied by N? It said E was at 5 and it is not at 5? But the secret word might have N at 5? We have no reason to avoid N at 5? Only that N cannot be at 4? Similarly, E cannot be at 5? But N at 5? Okay? So we can try? And E at 3? So:

 ""STEIN"": 
 1: S
 2: T
 3: E -> position 3 is new for E? Previously E was at 5? Now at 3? That's acceptable.
 4: I
 5: N -> position 5: previously E was at 5, but now N? This is acceptable? Because the feedback only told us the letter E is not in position 5? It didn't say anything about other letters? We can put N at 5? So yes? But note: the secret word does not have E at 5? But it could have another letter? So yes? 

 However, ""STEIN"" is a valid word? Yes? 

 But let me double-check: 
 For E: we must avoid position 5? But position 5? In STEIN, E is at position 3? So that is safe? 
 For N: we must avoid position 4? In STEIN? N is at position 5? That is safe? 

 Therefore, we can try ""STEIN"".

 But note: STEIN has T and I? 

 Alternatively, consider ""NEIST""? Not a common word? 

 Actually, ""STEIN"" might be acceptable? 

 Or maybe ""STINE"": which is less common?

 But ""STEIN"" is recognized.

 Now, among the possibilities: 
 ""BEGIN"": uses B, E, G, I, N -> letters: B, G, I?
 ""SINEW"": S, I, N, E, W -> S, I, W?
 ""STEIN"": S, T, E, I, N -> S, T, I?

 Since we haven't tested T? And T is very common? Perhaps ""STEIN"" is the best? And it also uses two of the known letters? 

 So let me choose ""STEIN"".

 Alternatively, we might try to cover the vowels? We know the word has E? And possibly other vowels? But A is ruled out? So maybe O, I, U? 

 STEIN has I? 

 So I think ""STEIN"" is a good choice? 

 But also note: We can't use position 4 for N? And in STEIN, N is at 5? Which is acceptable? 

 Therefore, I will go with ""STEIN"".

 But wait: STEIN: 
 Position 3: E? That's fine? 
 Position 5: N? That's fine? 

 We'll get feedback on each position.

 Alternatively, perhaps we can use a word that places E at a position we haven't tried? E was at 5? Now we have at position 2, 3? 

 Let me choose ""STEIN"" as the next guess.

 So the guess is ""STEIN"".

 We'll then get feedback on S, T, E, I, N.

 But note: we haven't tried S, T, I? And we have E and N at new positions.

 So let's go with that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess (""crane""):
- C, R, and A are not in the secret word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

For the second guess:
- Must be a valid 5-letter English word.
- Cannot include C, R, or A.
- Must include N and E (but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively).
- Should introduce new, common letters to gather more information.

The word ""stein"" satisfies these conditions:
- Positions: S (1), T (2), E (3), I (4), N (5).
- Places E at position 3 (avoiding position 5).
- Places N at position 5 (avoiding position 4).
- Tests new common letters: S, T, and I.

This guess maximizes information coverage while respecting the known constraints.

<guess>stein</guess>",stein,"We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: - (in the word, but wrong position)
 E: - (in the word, but wrong position)

 So, the secret word does not contain C, R, A. But it does contain N and E, but not in the positions they were guessed.
 Since ""crane"" had N at the 4th position and E at the 5th, that means in the secret word:
 - N is not in the 4th position, but it's somewhere else.
 - E is not in the 5th position, but it's somewhere else.

 We also know the secret word does not have C, R, A.

 Let's check: the first guess was ""crane"" -> N at position 4. The secret word has N but not at position 4. So we cannot use that position.

 Therefore, ""FEINT"" would have N at position 4 -> not allowed. So skip.

 Consider ""UNITE"": U, N, I, T, E -> 
 Positions: N at position 2, E at position 5? 
 But wait: in our first guess, E was at position 5? We also cannot have E at position 5? So we cannot put E at 5? And N at 2? 
 Actually, the feedback told us E is not at position 5? So we must avoid E at position 5? 
 Similarly, we must avoid N at position 4? 

 Therefore, E must not be at 5? N must not be at 4? 

 So ""UNITE"": 
 Position 1: U 
 Position 2: N -> new
 Position 3: I
 Position 4: T
 Position 5: E -> but we cannot put E at 5? It's disallowed.

 So ""UNITE"" is not acceptable.

 Therefore, let us use ""BEGIN"": 
 Positions: 
 1: B 
 2: E (previously E at 5, now at 2 -> new)
 3: G
 4: I
 5: N (previously N at 4, now at 5 -> new)

 So ""BEGIN"" can be tried.

 Alternatively, ""SINEW"": 
 1: S
 2: I
 3: N (new)
 4: E (new)
 5: W

 Both are acceptable.

 But note: there is also the possibility that the secret word might have repeated letters? But Wordle words are usually without duplicate letters? But let's assume no duplicates for now.

 I think either ""BEGIN"" or ""SINEW"" would be fine. Let's choose ""BEGIN"" because it places E at 2 and N at 5? Alternatively, perhaps we can choose a word that also uses the letter T? T is a common letter.

 Since T is common, maybe we should include T? But then we have to avoid the known incorrect positions and include E and N.

 Word: ""TENNY""? -> duplicate N? Also, T at 1, E at 2, N at 3 and 4? Not so good.

 How about ""BEINT""? Not a common word.

 Word: ""BENTS"": but that's 5 letters? B, E, N, T, S? 
 Positions: 
 1: B
 2: E -> okay (E was at 5, now at 2: new)
 3: N -> okay (N was at 4, now at 3: new)
 4: T
 5: S

 But it has E at 2 and N at 3? Both are new positions? And includes T? Also, ""BENTS"" is a valid word (meaning: plural of bent).

 But actually, we have to avoid duplicate letters? We don't know if the word has duplicates? But typically, Wordle words do not have duplicates? So we can assume no duplicates? Then ""BENTS"" would be acceptable? However, the word ""BENTS"" is not as common? And we might want a more common word.

 Alternatively, ""STENO"": S, T, E, N, O -> 
 E at 3? 
 Positions: 
 1: S
 2: T
 3: E -> not 5th? acceptable
 4: N -> but 4th position is disallowed? We cannot put N at 4? So bad.

 Oh, so we can't put N at 4. Therefore, ""STENO"" not allowed.

 How about ""STEIN"": S, T, E, I, N -> 
 Positions: 
 1: S
 2: T
 3: E -> ok
 4: I
 5: N -> but wait: N is at 5? And we are allowed? 
 However, E is at 3? Also, N is at 5? Both positions are acceptable? Because previously N was at 4 (disallowed) and E at 5 (disallowed). Now N at 5: that's allowed? Because the issue with E at 5? But N at 5? The feedback did not say that position 5 cannot be occupied by N? It said E was at 5 and it is not at 5? But the secret word might have N at 5? We have no reason to avoid N at 5? Only that N cannot be at 4? Similarly, E cannot be at 5? But N at 5? Okay? So we can try? And E at 3? So:

 ""STEIN"": 
 1: S
 2: T
 3: E -> position 3 is new for E? Previously E was at 5? Now at 3? That's acceptable.
 4: I
 5: N -> position 5: previously E was at 5, but now N? This is acceptable? Because the feedback only told us the letter E is not in position 5? It didn't say anything about other letters? We can put N at 5? So yes? But note: the secret word does not have E at 5? But it could have another letter? So yes? 

 However, ""STEIN"" is a valid word? Yes? 

 But let me double-check: 
 For E: we must avoid position 5? But position 5? In STEIN, E is at position 3? So that is safe? 
 For N: we must avoid position 4? In STEIN? N is at position 5? That is safe? 

 Therefore, we can try ""STEIN"".

 But note: STEIN has T and I? 

 Alternatively, consider ""NEIST""? Not a common word? 

 Actually, ""STEIN"" might be acceptable? 

 Or maybe ""STINE"": which is less common?

 But ""STEIN"" is recognized.

 Now, among the possibilities: 
 ""BEGIN"": uses B, E, G, I, N -> letters: B, G, I?
 ""SINEW"": S, I, N, E, W -> S, I, W?
 ""STEIN"": S, T, E, I, N -> S, T, I?

 Since we haven't tested T? And T is very common? Perhaps ""STEIN"" is the best? And it also uses two of the known letters? 

 So let me choose ""STEIN"".

 Alternatively, we might try to cover the vowels? We know the word has E? And possibly other vowels? But A is ruled out? So maybe O, I, U? 

 STEIN has I? 

 So I think ""STEIN"" is a good choice? 

 But also note: We can't use position 4 for N? And in STEIN, N is at 5? Which is acceptable? 

 Therefore, I will go with ""STEIN"".

 But wait: STEIN: 
 Position 3: E? That's fine? 
 Position 5: N? That's fine? 

 We'll get feedback on each position.

 Alternatively, perhaps we can use a word that places E at a position we haven't tried? E was at 5? Now we have at position 2, 3? 

 Let me choose ""STEIN"" as the next guess.

 So the guess is ""STEIN"".

 We'll then get feedback on S, T, E, I, N.

 But note: we haven't tried S, T, I? And we have E and N at new positions.

 So let's go with that.Based on the feedback from the first guess (""crane""):
- C, R, and A are not in the secret word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

For the second guess:
- Must be a valid 5-letter English word.
- Cannot include C, R, or A.
- Must include N and E (but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively).
- Should introduce new, common letters to gather more information.

The word ""stein"" satisfies these conditions:
- Positions: S (1), T (2), E (3), I (4), N (5).
- Places E at position 3 (avoiding position 5).
- Places N at position 5 (avoiding position 4).
- Tests new common letters: S, T, and I.

This guess maximizes information coverage while respecting the known constraints.",Guess 2: stein -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) E(-) I(x) N(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,TOKEN,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it is a popular starting word. It has three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).

 So, our first guess will be: CRANE

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: - (in the word, but wrong position)
 E: - (in the word, but wrong position)

 So, the secret word does not contain C, R, A. But it does contain N and E, but not in the positions they were guessed.
 Since ""crane"" had N at the 4th position and E at the 5th, that means in the secret word:
 - N is not in the 4th position, but it's somewhere else.
 - E is not in the 5th position, but it's somewhere else.

 We also know the secret word does not have C, R, A.

 Now, for the next guess, we should choose a word that:
 1. Does not contain C, R, A (since they are not in the word).
 2. Contains N and E (since they are in the word).
 3. Places N and E in different positions than the first guess (so not N at position 4 or E at position 5).

 Moreover, we want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Considering the feedback, let's think of a word that meets the criteria.

 Options for letters: Since we have removed C, R, A, we are left with other consonants and vowels.

 We know the secret word has N and E. Let's list possible words? That might be too many, but we can choose a word that uses common letters.

 Common consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
 Vowels: We have E (already known) and possibly others, but A is out. So vowels available: E, I, O, U (and sometimes Y).

 We also know that the word is 5 letters.

 Let's try to pick a word that includes N and E, and avoids C, R, A, and places N and E in new positions.

 Since N was in position 4 and E in position 5, we can put them in positions such as:
 N: position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but 5 was E's position? but E was at 5 and now we can try N elsewhere? Actually, we know N is not at 4, but it can be at 5? Similarly E can be at 4?).

 Let me try to form a word.

 Example: We could try ""LENS"" but that's 4 letters. We need 5.

 Possibilities: 
 - Let me try to put E at a different position, say position 3? Then N could be at position 2?

 Word: ""MINES"" -> has I, M, N, E, S. But we don't know if I, M, S are in the word? And note: E at position 5? But in our first guess E was at position 5 and now we are avoiding the same position? Actually, we are allowed to try E at position 5 again? But feedback told us E is not at position 5. So we must place E at positions 1,2,3,4? Similarly N must be placed at positions 1,2,3,5.

 We cannot put E at position 5? So we must use E in positions 1-4? Similarly, N cannot be at position 4? So N can be at positions 1,2,3,5.

 Now, we want to maximize learning other letters. So we can use letters that are common and haven't been tested.

 We also know that we must avoid C, R, A.

 Another idea: Use a word that has both E and N, and three new letters (which aren't C, R, A).

 Possible words: 
 - ""LINES"": has L, I, N, E, S. 
   Positions: N is at 3? We need to assign: 
   Let me define: position 1: L, 2: I, 3: N, 4: E, 5: S.
   But wait: N is at position 3 (which is new) and E at position 4 (also new). This seems acceptable.

 But is ""LINES"" a valid word? Yes.

 Alternatively, ""TENOR"": has T, E, N, O, R -> but R is already ruled out! So we cannot use R.

 Since R is not in the word, we must avoid R. Similarly, A and C are not in the word.

 So ""TENOR"" has R -> that's not allowed.

 Another word: ""MINCE"" -> has C? C is ruled out -> no.

 Word: ""BENCH"" -> has C: disallowed.

 How about ""STONE"": 
 - S, T, O, N, E -> positions: N at 4? But in the first guess, N was at 4 and we must avoid position 4 for N? Actually, we cannot put N at position 4? Because the feedback said N is not at position 4? So in ""STONE"", N is at position 4: that would be the same position? We are not supposed to repeat a known incorrect position? We can't use N at position 4 because we know it's not there.

 So: avoid placing N at position 4.

 ""STONE"" -> N is at position 4 -> not allowed.

 Alternative: ""SETON"" -> but that might not be common? And E is at position 2, N at position 5? That's acceptable.

 But let's think of more common words.

 Word: ""SINEW"": S, I, N, E, W.
 Positions: 
 1. S
 2. I
 3. N
 4. E
 5. W

 Notice: 
 - N is at position 3 (it was at 4 -> now changed to 3 -> new)
 - E is at position 4 (it was at 5 -> now at 4 -> new)

 This avoids the positions we know are incorrect.

 Also, the letters S, I, W haven't been tried.

 So ""SINEW"" seems a good candidate.

 Another common word: ""OPINE"": O, P, I, N, E -> 
 Positions: N at 4? But we cannot have N at position 4? So this is bad.

 Another: ""QUIET"" -> but no N? We must include N and E.

 We must include both N and E.

 Another option: ""DEIGN"": D, E, I, G, N -> 
 Positions: 
 1: D
 2: E (E was previously at 5, now at 2 -> new)
 3: I
 4: G
 5: N (N was at 4, now at 5 -> new)

 This seems acceptable: E is at 2, N at 5.

 But ""DEIGN"" is a word? Yes. Also, it tests D, I, G.

 But note: We have to use valid English words.

 Alternatively, ""BEGIN"": B, E, G, I, N -> 
 Positions: E at 2, N at 5 -> same as above? But avoids A, C, R.

 However, ""BEGIN"" uses B and G? And we haven't tried them.

 Now, comparing ""SINEW"" and ""BEGIN"": 
 ""SINEW"" has S, I, N, E, W -> S and W are new.
 ""BEGIN"" has B, E, G, I, N -> B and G are new.

 They are both fine. Which one gives more common letters? 

 Since we want to cover more common letters, let's look at frequency in English words.

 Common letters: E, T, N, ... but we know E and N are in. Then S is very common. So perhaps ""SINEW"" is better?

 Another possibility: ""OWING"" -> O, W, I, N, G -> missing E? Must have E, so no.

 Similarly, ""FEINT"": F, E, I, N, T -> 
 Positions: E at 2, N at 4? We cannot use N at 4 -> so bad? Actually, N is at 5? ""FEINT"": 
 1: F
 2: E
 3: I
 4: N -> position 4? Not allowed for N? We cannot put N at position 4.

 Let's check: the first guess was ""crane"" -> N at position 4. The secret word has N but not at position 4. So we cannot use that position.

 Therefore, ""FEINT"" would have N at position 4 -> not allowed. So skip.

 Consider ""UNITE"": U, N, I, T, E -> 
 Positions: N at position 2, E at position 5? 
 But wait: in our first guess, E was at position 5? We also cannot have E at position 5? So we cannot put E at 5? And N at 2? 
 Actually, the feedback told us E is not at position 5? So we must avoid E at position 5? 
 Similarly, we must avoid N at position 4? 

 Therefore, E must not be at 5? N must not be at 4? 

 So ""UNITE"": 
 Position 1: U 
 Position 2: N -> new
 Position 3: I
 Position 4: T
 Position 5: E -> but we cannot put E at 5? It's disallowed.

 So ""UNITE"" is not acceptable.

 Therefore, let us use ""BEGIN"": 
 Positions: 
 1: B 
 2: E (previously E at 5, now at 2 -> new)
 3: G
 4: I
 5: N (previously N at 4, now at 5 -> new)

 So ""BEGIN"" can be tried.

 Alternatively, ""SINEW"": 
 1: S
 2: I
 3: N (new)
 4: E (new)
 5: W

 Both are acceptable.

 But note: there is also the possibility that the secret word might have repeated letters? But Wordle words are usually without duplicate letters? But let's assume no duplicates for now.

 I think either ""BEGIN"" or ""SINEW"" would be fine. Let's choose ""BEGIN"" because it places E at 2 and N at 5? Alternatively, perhaps we can choose a word that also uses the letter T? T is a common letter.

 Since T is common, maybe we should include T? But then we have to avoid the known incorrect positions and include E and N.

 Word: ""TENNY""? -> duplicate N? Also, T at 1, E at 2, N at 3 and 4? Not so good.

 How about ""BEINT""? Not a common word.

 Word: ""BENTS"": but that's 5 letters? B, E, N, T, S? 
 Positions: 
 1: B
 2: E -> okay (E was at 5, now at 2: new)
 3: N -> okay (N was at 4, now at 3: new)
 4: T
 5: S

 But it has E at 2 and N at 3? Both are new positions? And includes T? Also, ""BENTS"" is a valid word (meaning: plural of bent).

 But actually, we have to avoid duplicate letters? We don't know if the word has duplicates? But typically, Wordle words do not have duplicates? So we can assume no duplicates? Then ""BENTS"" would be acceptable? However, the word ""BENTS"" is not as common? And we might want a more common word.

 Alternatively, ""STENO"": S, T, E, N, O -> 
 E at 3? 
 Positions: 
 1: S
 2: T
 3: E -> not 5th? acceptable
 4: N -> but 4th position is disallowed? We cannot put N at 4? So bad.

 Oh, so we can't put N at 4. Therefore, ""STENO"" not allowed.

 How about ""STEIN"": S, T, E, I, N -> 
 Positions: 
 1: S
 2: T
 3: E -> ok
 4: I
 5: N -> but wait: N is at 5? And we are allowed? 
 However, E is at 3? Also, N is at 5? Both positions are acceptable? Because previously N was at 4 (disallowed) and E at 5 (disallowed). Now N at 5: that's allowed? Because the issue with E at 5? But N at 5? The feedback did not say that position 5 cannot be occupied by N? It said E was at 5 and it is not at 5? But the secret word might have N at 5? We have no reason to avoid N at 5? Only that N cannot be at 4? Similarly, E cannot be at 5? But N at 5? Okay? So we can try? And E at 3? So:

 ""STEIN"": 
 1: S
 2: T
 3: E -> position 3 is new for E? Previously E was at 5? Now at 3? That's acceptable.
 4: I
 5: N -> position 5: previously E was at 5, but now N? This is acceptable? Because the feedback only told us the letter E is not in position 5? It didn't say anything about other letters? We can put N at 5? So yes? But note: the secret word does not have E at 5? But it could have another letter? So yes? 

 However, ""STEIN"" is a valid word? Yes? 

 But let me double-check: 
 For E: we must avoid position 5? But position 5? In STEIN, E is at position 3? So that is safe? 
 For N: we must avoid position 4? In STEIN? N is at position 5? That is safe? 

 Therefore, we can try ""STEIN"".

 But note: STEIN has T and I? 

 Alternatively, consider ""NEIST""? Not a common word? 

 Actually, ""STEIN"" might be acceptable? 

 Or maybe ""STINE"": which is less common?

 But ""STEIN"" is recognized.

 Now, among the possibilities: 
 ""BEGIN"": uses B, E, G, I, N -> letters: B, G, I?
 ""SINEW"": S, I, N, E, W -> S, I, W?
 ""STEIN"": S, T, E, I, N -> S, T, I?

 Since we haven't tested T? And T is very common? Perhaps ""STEIN"" is the best? And it also uses two of the known letters? 

 So let me choose ""STEIN"".

 Alternatively, we might try to cover the vowels? We know the word has E? And possibly other vowels? But A is ruled out? So maybe O, I, U? 

 STEIN has I? 

 So I think ""STEIN"" is a good choice? 

 But also note: We can't use position 4 for N? And in STEIN, N is at 5? Which is acceptable? 

 Therefore, I will go with ""STEIN"".

 But wait: STEIN: 
 Position 3: E? That's fine? 
 Position 5: N? That's fine? 

 We'll get feedback on each position.

 Alternatively, perhaps we can use a word that places E at a position we haven't tried? E was at 5? Now we have at position 2, 3? 

 Let me choose ""STEIN"" as the next guess.

 So the guess is ""STEIN"".

 We'll then get feedback on S, T, E, I, N.

 But note: we haven't tried S, T, I? And we have E and N at new positions.

 So let's go with that.Based on the feedback from the first guess (""crane""):
- C, R, and A are not in the secret word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

For the second guess:
- Must be a valid 5-letter English word.
- Cannot include C, R, or A.
- Must include N and E (but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively).
- Should introduce new, common letters to gather more information.

The word ""stein"" satisfies these conditions:
- Positions: S (1), T (2), E (3), I (4), N (5).
- Places E at position 3 (avoiding position 5).
- Places N at position 5 (avoiding position 4).
- Tests new common letters: S, T, and I.

This guess maximizes information coverage while respecting the known constraints.

So N can be at positions 1,2,3,5.\n\n Now, we want to maximize learning other letters. So we can use letters that are common and haven\'t been tested.\n\n We also know that we must avoid C, R, A.\n\n Another idea: Use a word that has both E and N, and three new letters (which aren\'t C, R, A).\n\n Possible words: \n - ""LINES"": has L, I, N, E, S. \n   Positions: N is at 3? We need to assign: \n   Let me define: position 1: L, 2: I, 3: N, 4: E, 5: S.\n   But wait: N is at position 3 (which is new) and E at position 4 (also new). This seems acceptable.\n\n But is ""LINES"" a valid word? Yes.\n\n Alternatively, ""TENOR"": has T, E, N, O, R -> but R is already ruled out! So we cannot use R.\n\n Since R is not in the word, we must avoid R. Similarly, A and C are not in the word.\n\n So ""TENOR"" has R -> that\'s not allowed.\n\n Another word: ""MINCE"" -> has C? C is ruled out -> no.\n\n Word: ""BENCH"" -> has C: disallowed.\n\n How about ""STONE"": \n - S, T, O, N, E -> positions: N at 4? But in the first guess, N was at 4 and we must avoid position 4 for N? Actually, we cannot put N at position 4? Because the feedback said N is not at position 4? So in ""STONE"", N is at position 4: that would be the same position? We are not supposed to repeat a known incorrect position? We can\'t use N at position 4 because we know it\'s not there.\n\n So: avoid placing N at position 4.\n\n ""STONE"" -> N is at position 4 -> not allowed.\n\n Alternative: ""SETON"" -> but that might not be common? And E is at position 2, N at position 5? That\'s acceptable.\n\n But let\'s think of more common words.\n\n Word: ""SINEW"": S, I, N, E, W.\n Positions: \n 1. S\n 2. I\n 3. N\n 4. E\n 5. W\n\n Notice: \n - N is at position 3 (it was at 4 -> now changed to 3 -> new)\n - E is at position 4 (it was at 5 -> now at 4 -> new)\n\n This avoids the positions we know are incorrect.\n\n Also, the letters S, I, W haven\'t been tried.\n\n So ""SINEW"" seems a good candidate.\n\n Another common word: ""OPINE"": O, P, I, N, E -> \n Positions: N at 4? But we cannot have N at position 4? So this is bad.\n\n Another: ""QUIET"" -> but no N? We must include N and E.\n\n We must include both N and E.\n\n Another option: ""DEIGN"": D, E, I, G, N -> \n Positions: \n 1: D\n 2: E (E was previously at 5, now at 2 -> new)\n 3: I\n 4: G\n 5: N (N was at 4, now at 5 -> new)\n\n This seems acceptable: E is at 2, N at 5.\n\n But ""DEIGN"" is a word? Yes. Also, it tests D, I, G.\n\n But note: We have to use valid English words.\n\n Alternatively, ""BEGIN"": B, E, G, I, N -> \n Positions: E at 2, N at 5 -> same as above? But avoids A, C, R.\n\n However, ""BEGIN"" uses B and G? And we haven\'t tried them.\n\n Now, comparing ""SINEW"" and ""BEGIN"": \n ""SINEW"" has S, I, N, E, W -> S and W are new.\n ""BEGIN"" has B, E, G, I, N -> B and G are new.\n\n They are both fine. Which one gives more common letters? \n\n Since we want to cover more common letters, let\'s look at frequency in English words.\n\n Common letters: E, T, N, ... but we know E and N are in. Then S is very common. So perhaps ""SINEW"" is better?\n\n Another possibility: ""OWING"" -> O, W, I, N, G -> missing E? Must have E, so no.\n\n Similarly, ""FEINT"": F, E, I, N, T -> \n Positions: E at 2, N at 4? We cannot use N at 4 -> so bad? Actually, N is at 5? ""FEINT"": \n 1: F\n 2: E\n 3: I\n 4: N -> position 4? Not allowed for N? We cannot put N at position 4.\n\n Let\'s check: the first guess was ""crane"" -> N at position 4. The secret word has N but not at position 4. So we cannot use that position.\n\n Therefore, ""FEINT"" would have N at position 4 -> not allowed. So skip.\n\n Consider ""UNITE"": U, N, I, T, E -> \n Positions: N at position 2, E at position 5? \n But wait: in our first guess, E was at position 5? We also cannot have E at position 5? So we cannot put E at 5? And N at 2? \n Actually, the feedback told us E is not at position 5? So we must avoid E at position 5? \n Similarly, we must avoid N at position 4? \n\n Therefore, E must not be at 5? N must not be at 4? \n\n So ""UNITE"": \n Position 1: U \n Position 2: N -> new\n Position 3: I\n Position 4: T\n Position 5: E -> but we cannot put E at 5? It\'s disallowed.\n\n So ""UNITE"" is not acceptable.\n\n Therefore, let us use ""BEGIN"": \n Positions: \n 1: B \n 2: E (previously E at 5, now at 2 -> new)\n 3: G\n 4: I\n 5: N (previously N at 4, now at 5 -> new)\n\n So ""BEGIN"" can be tried.\n\n Alternatively, ""SINEW"": \n 1: S\n 2: I\n 3: N (new)\n 4: E (new)\n 5: W\n\n Both are acceptable.\n\n But note: there is also the possibility that the secret word might have repeated letters? But Wordle words are usually without duplicate letters? But let\'s assume no duplicates for now.\n\n I think either ""BEGIN"" or ""SINEW"" would be fine. Let\'s choose ""BEGIN"" because it places E at 2 and N at 5? Alternatively, perhaps we can choose a word that also uses the letter T? T is a common letter.\n\n Since T is common, maybe we should include T? But then we have to avoid the known incorrect positions and include E and N.\n\n Word: ""TENNY""? -> duplicate N? Also, T at 1, E at 2, N at 3 and 4? Not so good.\n\n How about ""BEINT""? Not a common word.\n\n Word: ""BENTS"": but that\'s 5 letters? B, E, N, T, S? \n Positions: \n 1: B\n 2: E -> okay (E was at 5, now at 2: new)\n 3: N -> okay (N was at 4, now at 3: new)\n 4: T\n 5: S\n\n But it has E at 2 and N at 3? Both are new positions? And includes T? Also, ""BENTS"" is a valid word (meaning: plural of bent).\n\n But actually, we have to avoid duplicate letters? We don\'t know if the word has duplicates? But typically, Wordle words do not have duplicates? So we can assume no duplicates? Then ""BENTS"" would be acceptable? However, the word ""BENTS"" is not as common? And we might want a more common word.\n\n Alternatively, ""STENO"": S, T, E, N, O -> \n E at 3? \n Positions: \n 1: S\n 2: T\n 3: E -> not 5th? acceptable\n 4: N -> but 4th position is disallowed? We cannot put N at 4? So bad.\n\n Oh, so we can\'t put N at 4. Therefore, ""STENO"" not allowed.\n\n How about ""STEIN"": S, T, E, I, N -> \n Positions: \n 1: S\n 2: T\n 3: E -> ok\n 4: I\n 5: N -> but wait: N is at 5? And we are allowed? \n However, E is at 3? Also, N is at 5? Both positions are acceptable? Because previously N was at 4 (disallowed) and E at 5 (disallowed). Now N at 5: that\'s allowed? Because the issue with E at 5? But N at 5? The feedback did not say that position 5 cannot be occupied by N? It said E was at 5 and it is not at 5? But the secret word might have N at 5? We have no reason to avoid N at 5? Only that N cannot be at 4? Similarly, E cannot be at 5? But N at 5? Okay? So we can try? And E at 3? So:\n\n ""STEIN"": \n 1: S\n 2: T\n 3: E -> position 3 is new for E? Previously E was at 5? Now at 3? That\'s acceptable.\n 4: I\n 5: N -> position 5: previously E was at 5, but now N? This is acceptable? Because the feedback only told us the letter E is not in position 5? It didn\'t say anything about other letters? We can put N at 5? So yes? But note: the secret word does not have E at 5? But it could have another letter? So yes? \n\n However, ""STEIN"" is a valid word? Yes? \n\n But let me double-check: \n For E: we must avoid position 5? But position 5? In STEIN, E is at position 3? So that is safe? \n For N: we must avoid position 4? In STEIN? N is at position 5? That is safe? \n\n Therefore, we can try ""STEIN"".\n\n But note: STEIN has T and I? \n\n Alternatively, consider ""NEIST""? Not a common word? \n\n Actually, ""STEIN"" might be acceptable? \n\n Or maybe ""STINE"": which is less common?\n\n But ""STEIN"" is recognized.\n\n Now, among the possibilities: \n ""BEGIN"": uses B, E, G, I, N -> letters: B, G, I?\n ""SINEW"": S, I, N, E, W -> S, I, W?\n ""STEIN"": S, T, E, I, N -> S, T, I?\n\n Since we haven\'t tested T? And T is very common? Perhaps ""STEIN"" is the best? And it also uses two of the known letters? \n\n So let me choose ""STEIN"".\n\n Alternatively, we might try to cover the vowels? We know the word has E? And possibly other vowels? But A is ruled out? So maybe O, I, U? \n\n STEIN has I? \n\n So I think ""STEIN"" is a good choice? \n\n But also note: We can\'t use position 4 for N? And in STEIN, N is at 5? Which is acceptable? \n\n Therefore, I will go with ""STEIN"".\n\n But wait: STEIN: \n Position 3: E? That\'s fine? \n Position 5: N? That\'s fine? \n\n We\'ll get feedback on each position.\n\n Alternatively, perhaps we can use a word that places E at a position we haven\'t tried? E was at 5? Now we have at position 2, 3? \n\n Let me choose ""STEIN"" as the next guess.\n\n So the guess is ""STEIN"".\n\n We\'ll then get feedback on S, T, E, I, N.\n\n But note: we haven\'t tried S, T, I? And we have E and N at new positions.\n\n So let\'s go with that.Based on the feedback from the first guess (""crane""):\n- C, R, and A are not in the secret word.\n- N is in the word but not in position 4.\n- E is in the word but not in position 5.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Must be a valid 5-letter English word.\n- Cannot include C, R, or A.\n- Must include N and E (but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively).\n- Should introduce new, common letters to gather more information.\n\nThe word ""stein"" satisfies these conditions:\n- Positions: S (1), T (2), E (3), I (4), N (5).\n- Places E at position 3 (avoiding position 5).\n- Places N at position 5 (avoiding position 4).\n- Tests new common letters: S, T, and I.\n\nThis guess maximizes information coverage while respecting the known constraints.\n\n<guess>stein</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: stein -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) E(-) I(x) N(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, A are not in the word at all.
- N is in the word but not in position 4 (where it was guessed).
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (where it was guessed).

Second guess: ""stein"" -> S(x), T(-), E(-), I(x), N(✓)
Meaning:
- S is not in the word at all.
- T is in the word but not in position 2 (where it was guessed).
- E is in the word but not in position 3 (where it was guessed). Also, we already knew E is not in position 5.
- I is not in the word at all.
- N is in the word and exactly in position 5 (since it got a checkmark).

So, summarizing:
- Confirmed letters in the word: N (at position 5), E (somewhere, not at pos 3 or 5), T (somewhere, not at pos 2)
- Known absent letters: C, R, A, S, I
- Position constraints:
    - N must be at position 5 (so we know the last letter is N)
    - E cannot be at position 3 or 5 (so possibilities: 1,2,4)
    - T cannot be at position 2 (so possibilities: 1,3,4)

Now, we know the word has E and T, and N at the end. Also, from ""crane"", we have E and N present.

The word now has the pattern: ? ? ? ? N

We need to determine the other letters. Remember, we have 6 guesses total, and this is our third.

We should choose a word that:
1. Ends with N (so position 5 is fixed as N)
2. Contains E (but not at pos 3 or 5? And not at pos 5 since N is there? Actually, position 5 is taken by N, so E must be in 1,2, or 4?)
   But from the feedback of ""stein"", E is not at pos 3? And from ""crane"", E is not at pos 5? So E can be at positions 1, 2, or 4.
3. Contains T (but not at position 2? So T can be at positions 1, 3, or 4)
4. Avoids letters: C, R, A, S, I.

We also need to consider what other letters might be present.

Since we only have two known present letters (besides N): E and T? But note, there might be more? We had a '-' for E and T? And one checkmark for N? And the others were absent? 

But wait, in the first guess, ""crane"" had only N and E present? So there are at least three known letters: E, T, N? But wait, the second guess ""stein"" introduced T? And T was present? So the word must include T? 

However, note that we have 5 positions? We have N fixed at 5? Then positions 1,2,3,4? We know E and T? E must be at one of 1,2,4? T at one of 1,3,4? And then we have two more letters? 

But from the first guess, we had only two letters: N and E? Then we found T? So the word has: E, T, N? And two unknown letters? 

We must be cautious? We don't know the full set of present letters? We only know: E (from first guess), N (from both) and T (from second guess)? But there might be more? 

Also, note: we haven't found all letters? 

Therefore, for the next guess, we should try to include E and T? And put E in one of positions 1,2,4? And T in one of positions 1,3,4? And avoid using any excluded letters (C, R, A, S, I). 

Moreover, we should choose positions to test possible spots? Also, we want to cover common letters? 

Possibly, we can use E and T? And then fill with other common letters that haven't been tried? 

What letters have been tried? 

First guess: C, R, A, N, E? Then second: S, T, E, I, N? 

So tried letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, I? 

Excluded: C, R, A, S, I? 

Known present: N, E, T? 

N is fixed at 5? 

So the word is: [letter1] [letter2] [letter3] [letter4] N

We know E is one of positions 1,2,4? T is one of positions 1,3,4? And positions 1 and 4 might be taken by either? 

Also, letter2 and the remaining position? 

We need a word that satisfies these? 

We can choose a word that sets E and T? And then two new letters? 

But the pattern? 

Let us list possible placements:

Case 1: E at position 1? Then T can be at 3 or 4? 
Case 2: E at position 2? Then T at 3 or 4? 
Case 3: E at position 4? Then T at 1 or 3? 

We can also try to put E and T together? 

Moreover, we want the rest of the letters? We haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? 

But we want common ones? 

Let me form a word:

Option: Put E at position 1? Then the word: E ? ? ? N

Then T? Cannot be at 2? So must be at 3 or 4? 

Word? E.g., E __ T _ N? Or E __ _ T N?

But what words end with TN? 

With ETN? 

Example: ""EATEN""? But E at 1? But A is excluded? We cannot use A? 

""EATEN"": has A -> disallowed?

Another: ""EAGON""? Not a word? And has G? Also, do we try O? 

Perhaps ""ELTON"": E, L, T, O, N -> 
Positions: 
1: E -> but we haven't tested E at position 1? 
2: L? 
3: T -> but T cannot be at position 3? We don't forbid? Actually, we don't know? Previously T was at 2? So we forbid position 2 for T? But 3 is allowed? 
4: O? 
5: N? 

So ""ELTON""? It's a proper noun? Not valid?

Another word: ""EJECT""? But E at both? And J? Also, not five letters? 

Wait, think of standard words: 
Ending with TN: not many? But we have E at 1 and N at 5? 

Perhaps E at 2? Then the word: _ E ? ? N

T? Cannot be at 2? We have E at 2? So T must be at 1,3,4? 
But if we have E at 2? Then T? How about T at 3? 
Pattern: _ E T _ N? 
For example: ""PEATN""? Not a word? 

""METON"": M, E, T, O, N -> 
Positions: 1:M, 2:E, 3:T, 4:O, 5:N -> but wait: T cannot be at position 2? So we are putting T at 3? That's allowed? 
Similarly, E is at 2, which we haven't tried? We know E must be somewhere? But we don't allow E at 2? Actually, we have no constraint? E cannot be at 3 or 5? But at 2 is allowed? 

So ""METON"": 
M? We haven't tried?
E at 2? Which is acceptable? 
T at 3? 
O? 
N at 5? 

If ""METON"" is a valid word? It is a surname? Not common? 

What about ""GETON"": G, E, T, O, N -> same as above? 

""GETON"": valid? Get on? Not a standard word? 

Perhaps a better pattern? With E at position 4? 

Then: _ ? ? E N? 

And T? Must be at 1 or 3? 

If T at 1? T ? ? E N? 
Example: ""TOKEN""? But O? Also, T not at 2? But we don't forbid? 
But O? 

Actually, ""TOKEN"": T, O, K, E, N? 
Positions: 
1:T -> allowed? (since T can be at 1)
2:O? 
3:K? 
4:E? -> E at 4? This position is acceptable? 
5:N? 

But we don't know O? 

Similarly, ""TOTEM"": T, O, T, E, M? Has duplicate T? Not common? 

But ""TOKEN"" is a valid word? And avoids A, C, R, S, I? 

But also, we haven't tried O, K? 

But note: we are trying to get information? 

However, we also note that T and E? 

But let's be systematic: We have the letter T? And E? And we need two other letters? 

What about trying ""TWEEN""? T, W, E, E, N? Duplicate E? Not generally in Wordle? And violates? 

Another idea: We can use the word ""OFTEN""? 
O, F, T, E, N? 
Positions: 
1: O? We don't know? 
2: F? 
3: T? -> T at position 3? Not forbidden? 
4: E? -> This is acceptable? Because E at 4? 
5: N? 

That pattern: 
We have E at 4? And T at 3? And O and F? 

Is O and F allowed? Yes? Because we haven't excluded them? 

Now, consider the constraints? 
We know E must be in the word? We put it at 4? Which is acceptable? 
T? Must be in the word? We put at 3? And we know T cannot be at 2? So position 3 is allowed? 

So ""OFTEN"" is a valid word? Yes? And it tests O and F? 

But note: position 1 and 2? 

Also, we want to test T? But already confirmed? 

Moreover, we can try to place E at a position that might rule in or out? 

But consider the constraints? 

However, note: we also have to remember that in the first guess, we had N? And now we know N is at 5? 

So OFTEN: 
- O? Unknown? 
- F? 
- T? Confirmed? 
- E? Confirmed? 
- N? Confirmed? 

But the word ""OFTEN"" is valid? 

But wait: we know T is present? We are putting T at position 3? 

Now, is there a conflict? 

Alternatively, we may choose a word that does not use O? Since O is a vowel? But we haven't tested? 

What about ""BETON"": B, E, T, O, N -> 
Positions: 
1: B? 
2: E? 
3: T? 
4: O? 
5: N? 

But E is at position 2? That's acceptable? 
T is at position 3? That's acceptable? 

But note: we have to have distinct letters? 

""BETON"" is a word? Yes? A technical term? 

But OFTEN might be more common? 

Another common word: ""TENON""? 
T, E, N, O, N -> duplicate N? Not possible? Usually? 

Another: ""DETON"": D, E, T, O, N? Valid? Not common? 

Alternatively, we can fix E at position 1? 

Word: E, ?, ?, T, N? 
Or E, ?, T, ?, N? 
For example: ""EDGON""? Not a word? 
Or ""EXOTN""? Not a word? 

Alternatively, E at 4? Then T at 1? 
Word: T, ?, ?, E, N? 
For example: ""TUBEN""? Not a word? 
""THEN"": only 4 letters? 

Common: ""TAKEN""? T, A, K, E, N? But A is excluded? 
""TOKEN"": we considered? 

Or ""WOMEN""? W, O, M, E, N -> E at 4? 
Positions: 
1:W? 
2:O? 
3:M? 
4:E? 
5:N? 
And T? But this word doesn't have T? But we know T is in the word? So we must include T? 

We cannot ignore T? 

Therefore, the guess must include T? 

Similarly, we must include E? 

So in the next guess, we must include T and E? 

So how about ""TENOR""? But R? R is excluded? 

Similarly, ""TEETH"" has duplicate E? Not valid? 

""TEENY"": T, E, E, N, Y? Duplicate E? 

So we need common words? 

Consider: 
- E at 1: ET _ _ N? 
Example: ""ETUUN""? Not a word? 

- E at 2: _ E T _ N? 
Example: ""METAL""? But A? Excluded? 
""METRO""? R excluded? 
""METIC"": C excluded? 
""METHS"": S excluded? 
""METES"" has duplicate E? 

But ""METON"" I thought earlier? Or ""GETON""? 

Perhaps ""VETON""? Not a word? 

Alternatively, E at 4? And T at 1? 
Word: T _ _ E N? 
Examples: 
""TABLE"": A excluded? 
""TOKEN"": O? 
""TAKEN"": A excluded? 
""TILED"": I excluded? 
""TYRED"": R? 
""TIMED"": M, D? 
""TOWED"": O, W, E, D? 
But wait: ""TOWED"": T, O, W, E, D? 
Positions: 
1:T? 
2:O? 
3:W? 
4:E? 
5:D? 
This has T? And E? 
Constraints: 
- E at 4? Accepted? 
- T at 1? Accepted? 
- Letters: T, O, W, E, D? 
Excluded? C, R, A, S, I? We don't use? 
So allowed? 
Is ""TOWED"" a word? Yes: past tense of tow? 

But what about the letter D? 

Similarly, ""BAKED"": has A? Excluded? 

So ""TOWED"" is acceptable? 

Also, ""OFFED"": O, F, F, E, D? Duplicate F? Not common? 

But ""TOWED"" has no duplicates? 

Alternatively, E at 4? And T at 3? 
Word: _ ? T E N? 
Examples: 
""GATEN""? Not word? 
""LOTEN""? Not word? 
""KETEN"": K, E, T, E, N? Duplicate E? 
""WETEN""? Not common? 

Therefore, suitable words include: ""TOKEN"", ""OFTEN"", ""TOWED"", ""BETON"", etc.

Now, which one gives the most coverage? 
- ""OFTEN"": includes O, F, T, E, N? T and E we already know? So testing O and F?
- ""TOKEN"": T, O, K, E, N? Testing O and K?
- ""TOWED"": T, O, W, E, D? Testing O, W, D? 

We want to test letters that haven't been tried? 

Previously tried letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, I? 
So new ones in ""OFTEN"": O, F? 
In ""TOKEN"": O, K? 
In ""TOWED"": O, W, D? 

""TOWED"" tests three new letters? But one of them is a vowel? 

But note: we have only one E? But we are including E? 

But E and T and N are confirmed? So we are only getting information about O, W, D? 

Similarly, ""OFTEN"" tests O and F? 

Perhaps ""OFTEN"" might be more common? Or we can choose one? 

Consider that we might also get position constraints? 

But I think ""OFTEN"" is a good candidate? Because it has common letters? 

Alternatively, we can choose ""OZONE""? O, Z, O, N, E -> duplicate O? Also, no T? 

But we have to include T? 

Another idea: Why not try ""PUTEN""? Not a word? 

I think we must include T. 

So, let me choose ""OFTEN"". 

It meets all constraints? 
- O? not excluded? 
- F? not excluded? 
- T? at position 3? not at 2? acceptable? 
- E? at position 4? acceptable? 
- N? at position 5? fixed? 

And the pattern: O F T E N? So positions: 
1: O 
2: F 
3: T 
4: E 
5: N 

This should be valid? 

We'll then get feedback? 

If there are problems? For example, if O or F are absent? Then we can know? 

But note: there is a possibility that E is actually at position 1? Then putting E at position 4 might be wrong? But we are trying to test? 

If the word is, say, ""TEPID""? But we know I is excluded? 

So let me go with ""OFTEN"". 

We'll get its feedback? 

So our guess is ""often"". 

But wait: the word ""OFTEN"" has E at 4? But we haven't tried E at 1? That's okay? 

If the secret word has E at 1? Then ""OFTEN"" would show E as not? But it is in the word? So we would get '-' for E? And then we know E is not at 4? 

Similarly? 

I think it's acceptable? Of course, a word that has E at 1 and T at 3? Would be? 

For example: E _ T _ N? 
What words? ""ETTIN""? Not common? 
""EMPTN"" not valid? 
So probably rare? 

I think ""OFTEN"" is reasonable.

Alternatively, to explicitly test E at 1? We have to use a word that starts with E? 

But then also includes T? So: E _ ? T N? Not many common words? 

Example: ""ENTT..."" -> but position 5 is N? 

""ENTMT""? Not valid? 

So start with E? Third letter T? And fifth N: E ? T ? N? 

Words: ""EATON"": A excluded? 
""ESTON"": S excluded? 
But nothing? 

Therefore, we choose ""OFTEN"". 

Summary:
- Guess: ""often""
- Pattern: O F T E N
- Tests absent letters: O, F
- Adheres to constraints: E at position 4 (allowed); T at position 3 (allowed, since we only know T cannot be at position 2).

<guess>often</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback:

1. From ""crane"" (C: absent, R: absent, A: absent, N: present but wrong position, E: present but wrong position):
   - Excluded letters: C, R, A.
   - Confirmed letters: N (must be present, not position 4) and E (must be present, not position 5).

2. From ""stein"" (S: absent, T: present but wrong position, E: present but wrong position, I: absent, N: correct position):
   - Excluded letters: S, I.
   - Confirmed letters: T (present, not position 2) and E (confirmed present again, not position 3).
   - N is locked in position 5.

Constraints:
- Secret word structure: ? ? ? ? N
- E must be in position 1, 2, or 4 (not 3 or 5).
- T must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (not 2).
- Must include E and T (besides N).
- Excluded letters: A, C, I, R, S.

New guess considerations:
- Focus on placing E and T in allowed positions while testing new letters.
- Try ""often"": 
  - Ends with N (position 5).
  - E at position 4 (allowed).
  - T at position 3 (allowed).
  - Introduces O and F (common letters, not excluded).
- This tests E position 4, T position 3, and verifies O/F presence.

This guess maximizes information by targeting E/T placement constraints and exploring new letters.

<guess>often</guess>",often,"We are given feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, A are not in the word at all.
- N is in the word but not in position 4 (where it was guessed).
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (where it was guessed).

Second guess: ""stein"" -> S(x), T(-), E(-), I(x), N(✓)
Meaning:
- S is not in the word at all.
- T is in the word but not in position 2 (where it was guessed).
- E is in the word but not in position 3 (where it was guessed). Also, we already knew E is not in position 5.
- I is not in the word at all.
- N is in the word and exactly in position 5 (since it got a checkmark).

So, summarizing:
- Confirmed letters in the word: N (at position 5), E (somewhere, not at pos 3 or 5), T (somewhere, not at pos 2)
- Known absent letters: C, R, A, S, I
- Position constraints:
    - N must be at position 5 (so we know the last letter is N)
    - E cannot be at position 3 or 5 (so possibilities: 1,2,4)
    - T cannot be at position 2 (so possibilities: 1,3,4)

Now, we know the word has E and T, and N at the end. Also, from ""crane"", we have E and N present.

The word now has the pattern: ? ? ? ? N

We need to determine the other letters. Remember, we have 6 guesses total, and this is our third.

We should choose a word that:
1. Ends with N (so position 5 is fixed as N)
2. Contains E (but not at pos 3 or 5? And not at pos 5 since N is there? Actually, position 5 is taken by N, so E must be in 1,2, or 4?)
   But from the feedback of ""stein"", E is not at pos 3? And from ""crane"", E is not at pos 5? So E can be at positions 1, 2, or 4.
3. Contains T (but not at position 2? So T can be at positions 1, 3, or 4)
4. Avoids letters: C, R, A, S, I.

We also need to consider what other letters might be present.

Since we only have two known present letters (besides N): E and T? But note, there might be more? We had a '-' for E and T? And one checkmark for N? And the others were absent? 

But wait, in the first guess, ""crane"" had only N and E present? So there are at least three known letters: E, T, N? But wait, the second guess ""stein"" introduced T? And T was present? So the word must include T? 

However, note that we have 5 positions? We have N fixed at 5? Then positions 1,2,3,4? We know E and T? E must be at one of 1,2,4? T at one of 1,3,4? And then we have two more letters? 

But from the first guess, we had only two letters: N and E? Then we found T? So the word has: E, T, N? And two unknown letters? 

We must be cautious? We don't know the full set of present letters? We only know: E (from first guess), N (from both) and T (from second guess)? But there might be more? 

Also, note: we haven't found all letters? 

Therefore, for the next guess, we should try to include E and T? And put E in one of positions 1,2,4? And T in one of positions 1,3,4? And avoid using any excluded letters (C, R, A, S, I). 

Moreover, we should choose positions to test possible spots? Also, we want to cover common letters? 

Possibly, we can use E and T? And then fill with other common letters that haven't been tried? 

What letters have been tried? 

First guess: C, R, A, N, E? Then second: S, T, E, I, N? 

So tried letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, I? 

Excluded: C, R, A, S, I? 

Known present: N, E, T? 

N is fixed at 5? 

So the word is: [letter1] [letter2] [letter3] [letter4] N

We know E is one of positions 1,2,4? T is one of positions 1,3,4? And positions 1 and 4 might be taken by either? 

Also, letter2 and the remaining position? 

We need a word that satisfies these? 

We can choose a word that sets E and T? And then two new letters? 

But the pattern? 

Let us list possible placements:

Case 1: E at position 1? Then T can be at 3 or 4? 
Case 2: E at position 2? Then T at 3 or 4? 
Case 3: E at position 4? Then T at 1 or 3? 

We can also try to put E and T together? 

Moreover, we want the rest of the letters? We haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? 

But we want common ones? 

Let me form a word:

Option: Put E at position 1? Then the word: E ? ? ? N

Then T? Cannot be at 2? So must be at 3 or 4? 

Word? E.g., E __ T _ N? Or E __ _ T N?

But what words end with TN? 

With ETN? 

Example: ""EATEN""? But E at 1? But A is excluded? We cannot use A? 

""EATEN"": has A -> disallowed?

Another: ""EAGON""? Not a word? And has G? Also, do we try O? 

Perhaps ""ELTON"": E, L, T, O, N -> 
Positions: 
1: E -> but we haven't tested E at position 1? 
2: L? 
3: T -> but T cannot be at position 3? We don't forbid? Actually, we don't know? Previously T was at 2? So we forbid position 2 for T? But 3 is allowed? 
4: O? 
5: N? 

So ""ELTON""? It's a proper noun? Not valid?

Another word: ""EJECT""? But E at both? And J? Also, not five letters? 

Wait, think of standard words: 
Ending with TN: not many? But we have E at 1 and N at 5? 

Perhaps E at 2? Then the word: _ E ? ? N

T? Cannot be at 2? We have E at 2? So T must be at 1,3,4? 
But if we have E at 2? Then T? How about T at 3? 
Pattern: _ E T _ N? 
For example: ""PEATN""? Not a word? 

""METON"": M, E, T, O, N -> 
Positions: 1:M, 2:E, 3:T, 4:O, 5:N -> but wait: T cannot be at position 2? So we are putting T at 3? That's allowed? 
Similarly, E is at 2, which we haven't tried? We know E must be somewhere? But we don't allow E at 2? Actually, we have no constraint? E cannot be at 3 or 5? But at 2 is allowed? 

So ""METON"": 
M? We haven't tried?
E at 2? Which is acceptable? 
T at 3? 
O? 
N at 5? 

If ""METON"" is a valid word? It is a surname? Not common? 

What about ""GETON"": G, E, T, O, N -> same as above? 

""GETON"": valid? Get on? Not a standard word? 

Perhaps a better pattern? With E at position 4? 

Then: _ ? ? E N? 

And T? Must be at 1 or 3? 

If T at 1? T ? ? E N? 
Example: ""TOKEN""? But O? Also, T not at 2? But we don't forbid? 
But O? 

Actually, ""TOKEN"": T, O, K, E, N? 
Positions: 
1:T -> allowed? (since T can be at 1)
2:O? 
3:K? 
4:E? -> E at 4? This position is acceptable? 
5:N? 

But we don't know O? 

Similarly, ""TOTEM"": T, O, T, E, M? Has duplicate T? Not common? 

But ""TOKEN"" is a valid word? And avoids A, C, R, S, I? 

But also, we haven't tried O, K? 

But note: we are trying to get information? 

However, we also note that T and E? 

But let's be systematic: We have the letter T? And E? And we need two other letters? 

What about trying ""TWEEN""? T, W, E, E, N? Duplicate E? Not generally in Wordle? And violates? 

Another idea: We can use the word ""OFTEN""? 
O, F, T, E, N? 
Positions: 
1: O? We don't know? 
2: F? 
3: T? -> T at position 3? Not forbidden? 
4: E? -> This is acceptable? Because E at 4? 
5: N? 

That pattern: 
We have E at 4? And T at 3? And O and F? 

Is O and F allowed? Yes? Because we haven't excluded them? 

Now, consider the constraints? 
We know E must be in the word? We put it at 4? Which is acceptable? 
T? Must be in the word? We put at 3? And we know T cannot be at 2? So position 3 is allowed? 

So ""OFTEN"" is a valid word? Yes? And it tests O and F? 

But note: position 1 and 2? 

Also, we want to test T? But already confirmed? 

Moreover, we can try to place E at a position that might rule in or out? 

But consider the constraints? 

However, note: we also have to remember that in the first guess, we had N? And now we know N is at 5? 

So OFTEN: 
- O? Unknown? 
- F? 
- T? Confirmed? 
- E? Confirmed? 
- N? Confirmed? 

But the word ""OFTEN"" is valid? 

But wait: we know T is present? We are putting T at position 3? 

Now, is there a conflict? 

Alternatively, we may choose a word that does not use O? Since O is a vowel? But we haven't tested? 

What about ""BETON"": B, E, T, O, N -> 
Positions: 
1: B? 
2: E? 
3: T? 
4: O? 
5: N? 

But E is at position 2? That's acceptable? 
T is at position 3? That's acceptable? 

But note: we have to have distinct letters? 

""BETON"" is a word? Yes? A technical term? 

But OFTEN might be more common? 

Another common word: ""TENON""? 
T, E, N, O, N -> duplicate N? Not possible? Usually? 

Another: ""DETON"": D, E, T, O, N? Valid? Not common? 

Alternatively, we can fix E at position 1? 

Word: E, ?, ?, T, N? 
Or E, ?, T, ?, N? 
For example: ""EDGON""? Not a word? 
Or ""EXOTN""? Not a word? 

Alternatively, E at 4? Then T at 1? 
Word: T, ?, ?, E, N? 
For example: ""TUBEN""? Not a word? 
""THEN"": only 4 letters? 

Common: ""TAKEN""? T, A, K, E, N? But A is excluded? 
""TOKEN"": we considered? 

Or ""WOMEN""? W, O, M, E, N -> E at 4? 
Positions: 
1:W? 
2:O? 
3:M? 
4:E? 
5:N? 
And T? But this word doesn't have T? But we know T is in the word? So we must include T? 

We cannot ignore T? 

Therefore, the guess must include T? 

Similarly, we must include E? 

So in the next guess, we must include T and E? 

So how about ""TENOR""? But R? R is excluded? 

Similarly, ""TEETH"" has duplicate E? Not valid? 

""TEENY"": T, E, E, N, Y? Duplicate E? 

So we need common words? 

Consider: 
- E at 1: ET _ _ N? 
Example: ""ETUUN""? Not a word? 

- E at 2: _ E T _ N? 
Example: ""METAL""? But A? Excluded? 
""METRO""? R excluded? 
""METIC"": C excluded? 
""METHS"": S excluded? 
""METES"" has duplicate E? 

But ""METON"" I thought earlier? Or ""GETON""? 

Perhaps ""VETON""? Not a word? 

Alternatively, E at 4? And T at 1? 
Word: T _ _ E N? 
Examples: 
""TABLE"": A excluded? 
""TOKEN"": O? 
""TAKEN"": A excluded? 
""TILED"": I excluded? 
""TYRED"": R? 
""TIMED"": M, D? 
""TOWED"": O, W, E, D? 
But wait: ""TOWED"": T, O, W, E, D? 
Positions: 
1:T? 
2:O? 
3:W? 
4:E? 
5:D? 
This has T? And E? 
Constraints: 
- E at 4? Accepted? 
- T at 1? Accepted? 
- Letters: T, O, W, E, D? 
Excluded? C, R, A, S, I? We don't use? 
So allowed? 
Is ""TOWED"" a word? Yes: past tense of tow? 

But what about the letter D? 

Similarly, ""BAKED"": has A? Excluded? 

So ""TOWED"" is acceptable? 

Also, ""OFFED"": O, F, F, E, D? Duplicate F? Not common? 

But ""TOWED"" has no duplicates? 

Alternatively, E at 4? And T at 3? 
Word: _ ? T E N? 
Examples: 
""GATEN""? Not word? 
""LOTEN""? Not word? 
""KETEN"": K, E, T, E, N? Duplicate E? 
""WETEN""? Not common? 

Therefore, suitable words include: ""TOKEN"", ""OFTEN"", ""TOWED"", ""BETON"", etc.

Now, which one gives the most coverage? 
- ""OFTEN"": includes O, F, T, E, N? T and E we already know? So testing O and F?
- ""TOKEN"": T, O, K, E, N? Testing O and K?
- ""TOWED"": T, O, W, E, D? Testing O, W, D? 

We want to test letters that haven't been tried? 

Previously tried letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, I? 
So new ones in ""OFTEN"": O, F? 
In ""TOKEN"": O, K? 
In ""TOWED"": O, W, D? 

""TOWED"" tests three new letters? But one of them is a vowel? 

But note: we have only one E? But we are including E? 

But E and T and N are confirmed? So we are only getting information about O, W, D? 

Similarly, ""OFTEN"" tests O and F? 

Perhaps ""OFTEN"" might be more common? Or we can choose one? 

Consider that we might also get position constraints? 

But I think ""OFTEN"" is a good candidate? Because it has common letters? 

Alternatively, we can choose ""OZONE""? O, Z, O, N, E -> duplicate O? Also, no T? 

But we have to include T? 

Another idea: Why not try ""PUTEN""? Not a word? 

I think we must include T. 

So, let me choose ""OFTEN"". 

It meets all constraints? 
- O? not excluded? 
- F? not excluded? 
- T? at position 3? not at 2? acceptable? 
- E? at position 4? acceptable? 
- N? at position 5? fixed? 

And the pattern: O F T E N? So positions: 
1: O 
2: F 
3: T 
4: E 
5: N 

This should be valid? 

We'll then get feedback? 

If there are problems? For example, if O or F are absent? Then we can know? 

But note: there is a possibility that E is actually at position 1? Then putting E at position 4 might be wrong? But we are trying to test? 

If the word is, say, ""TEPID""? But we know I is excluded? 

So let me go with ""OFTEN"". 

We'll get its feedback? 

So our guess is ""often"". 

But wait: the word ""OFTEN"" has E at 4? But we haven't tried E at 1? That's okay? 

If the secret word has E at 1? Then ""OFTEN"" would show E as not? But it is in the word? So we would get '-' for E? And then we know E is not at 4? 

Similarly? 

I think it's acceptable? Of course, a word that has E at 1 and T at 3? Would be? 

For example: E _ T _ N? 
What words? ""ETTIN""? Not common? 
""EMPTN"" not valid? 
So probably rare? 

I think ""OFTEN"" is reasonable.

Alternatively, to explicitly test E at 1? We have to use a word that starts with E? 

But then also includes T? So: E _ ? T N? Not many common words? 

Example: ""ENTT..."" -> but position 5 is N? 

""ENTMT""? Not valid? 

So start with E? Third letter T? And fifth N: E ? T ? N? 

Words: ""EATON"": A excluded? 
""ESTON"": S excluded? 
But nothing? 

Therefore, we choose ""OFTEN"". 

Summary:
- Guess: ""often""
- Pattern: O F T E N
- Tests absent letters: O, F
- Adheres to constraints: E at position 4 (allowed); T at position 3 (allowed, since we only know T cannot be at position 2).

<guess>often</guess>After analyzing the feedback:

1. From ""crane"" (C: absent, R: absent, A: absent, N: present but wrong position, E: present but wrong position):
   - Excluded letters: C, R, A.
   - Confirmed letters: N (must be present, not position 4) and E (must be present, not position 5).

2. From ""stein"" (S: absent, T: present but wrong position, E: present but wrong position, I: absent, N: correct position):
   - Excluded letters: S, I.
   - Confirmed letters: T (present, not position 2) and E (confirmed present again, not position 3).
   - N is locked in position 5.

Constraints:
- Secret word structure: ? ? ? ? N
- E must be in position 1, 2, or 4 (not 3 or 5).
- T must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (not 2).
- Must include E and T (besides N).
- Excluded letters: A, C, I, R, S.

New guess considerations:
- Focus on placing E and T in allowed positions while testing new letters.
- Try ""often"": 
  - Ends with N (position 5).
  - E at position 4 (allowed).
  - T at position 3 (allowed).
  - Introduces O and F (common letters, not excluded).
- This tests E position 4, T position 3, and verifies O/F presence.

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,TOKEN,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it is a popular starting word. It has three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).

 So, our first guess will be: CRANE

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: - (in the word, but wrong position)
 E: - (in the word, but wrong position)

 So, the secret word does not contain C, R, A. But it does contain N and E, but not in the positions they were guessed.
 Since ""crane"" had N at the 4th position and E at the 5th, that means in the secret word:
 - N is not in the 4th position, but it's somewhere else.
 - E is not in the 5th position, but it's somewhere else.

 We also know the secret word does not have C, R, A.

 Now, for the next guess, we should choose a word that:
 1. Does not contain C, R, A (since they are not in the word).
 2. Contains N and E (since they are in the word).
 3. Places N and E in different positions than the first guess (so not N at position 4 or E at position 5).

 Moreover, we want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Considering the feedback, let's think of a word that meets the criteria.

 Options for letters: Since we have removed C, R, A, we are left with other consonants and vowels.

 We know the secret word has N and E. Let's list possible words? That might be too many, but we can choose a word that uses common letters.

 Common consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
 Vowels: We have E (already known) and possibly others, but A is out. So vowels available: E, I, O, U (and sometimes Y).

 We also know that the word is 5 letters.

 Let's try to pick a word that includes N and E, and avoids C, R, A, and places N and E in new positions.

 Since N was in position 4 and E in position 5, we can put them in positions such as:
 N: position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but 5 was E's position? but E was at 5 and now we can try N elsewhere? Actually, we know N is not at 4, but it can be at 5? Similarly E can be at 4?).

 Let me try to form a word.

 Example: We could try ""LENS"" but that's 4 letters. We need 5.

 Possibilities: 
 - Let me try to put E at a different position, say position 3? Then N could be at position 2?

 Word: ""MINES"" -> has I, M, N, E, S. But we don't know if I, M, S are in the word? And note: E at position 5? But in our first guess E was at position 5 and now we are avoiding the same position? Actually, we are allowed to try E at position 5 again? But feedback told us E is not at position 5. So we must place E at positions 1,2,3,4? Similarly N must be placed at positions 1,2,3,5.

 We cannot put E at position 5? So we must use E in positions 1-4? Similarly, N cannot be at position 4? So N can be at positions 1,2,3,5.

 Now, we want to maximize learning other letters. So we can use letters that are common and haven't been tested.

 We also know that we must avoid C, R, A.

 Another idea: Use a word that has both E and N, and three new letters (which aren't C, R, A).

 Possible words: 
 - ""LINES"": has L, I, N, E, S. 
   Positions: N is at 3? We need to assign: 
   Let me define: position 1: L, 2: I, 3: N, 4: E, 5: S.
   But wait: N is at position 3 (which is new) and E at position 4 (also new). This seems acceptable.

 But is ""LINES"" a valid word? Yes.

 Alternatively, ""TENOR"": has T, E, N, O, R -> but R is already ruled out! So we cannot use R.

 Since R is not in the word, we must avoid R. Similarly, A and C are not in the word.

 So ""TENOR"" has R -> that's not allowed.

 Another word: ""MINCE"" -> has C? C is ruled out -> no.

 Word: ""BENCH"" -> has C: disallowed.

 How about ""STONE"": 
 - S, T, O, N, E -> positions: N at 4? But in the first guess, N was at 4 and we must avoid position 4 for N? Actually, we cannot put N at position 4? Because the feedback said N is not at position 4? So in ""STONE"", N is at position 4: that would be the same position? We are not supposed to repeat a known incorrect position? We can't use N at position 4 because we know it's not there.

 So: avoid placing N at position 4.

 ""STONE"" -> N is at position 4 -> not allowed.

 Alternative: ""SETON"" -> but that might not be common? And E is at position 2, N at position 5? That's acceptable.

 But let's think of more common words.

 Word: ""SINEW"": S, I, N, E, W.
 Positions: 
 1. S
 2. I
 3. N
 4. E
 5. W

 Notice: 
 - N is at position 3 (it was at 4 -> now changed to 3 -> new)
 - E is at position 4 (it was at 5 -> now at 4 -> new)

 This avoids the positions we know are incorrect.

 Also, the letters S, I, W haven't been tried.

 So ""SINEW"" seems a good candidate.

 Another common word: ""OPINE"": O, P, I, N, E -> 
 Positions: N at 4? But we cannot have N at position 4? So this is bad.

 Another: ""QUIET"" -> but no N? We must include N and E.

 We must include both N and E.

 Another option: ""DEIGN"": D, E, I, G, N -> 
 Positions: 
 1: D
 2: E (E was previously at 5, now at 2 -> new)
 3: I
 4: G
 5: N (N was at 4, now at 5 -> new)

 This seems acceptable: E is at 2, N at 5.

 But ""DEIGN"" is a word? Yes. Also, it tests D, I, G.

 But note: We have to use valid English words.

 Alternatively, ""BEGIN"": B, E, G, I, N -> 
 Positions: E at 2, N at 5 -> same as above? But avoids A, C, R.

 However, ""BEGIN"" uses B and G? And we haven't tried them.

 Now, comparing ""SINEW"" and ""BEGIN"": 
 ""SINEW"" has S, I, N, E, W -> S and W are new.
 ""BEGIN"" has B, E, G, I, N -> B and G are new.

 They are both fine. Which one gives more common letters? 

 Since we want to cover more common letters, let's look at frequency in English words.

 Common letters: E, T, N, ... but we know E and N are in. Then S is very common. So perhaps ""SINEW"" is better?

 Another possibility: ""OWING"" -> O, W, I, N, G -> missing E? Must have E, so no.

 Similarly, ""FEINT"": F, E, I, N, T -> 
 Positions: E at 2, N at 4? We cannot use N at 4 -> so bad? Actually, N is at 5? ""FEINT"": 
 1: F
 2: E
 3: I
 4: N -> position 4? Not allowed for N? We cannot put N at position 4.

 Let's check: the first guess was ""crane"" -> N at position 4. The secret word has N but not at position 4. So we cannot use that position.

 Therefore, ""FEINT"" would have N at position 4 -> not allowed. So skip.

 Consider ""UNITE"": U, N, I, T, E -> 
 Positions: N at position 2, E at position 5? 
 But wait: in our first guess, E was at position 5? We also cannot have E at position 5? So we cannot put E at 5? And N at 2? 
 Actually, the feedback told us E is not at position 5? So we must avoid E at position 5? 
 Similarly, we must avoid N at position 4? 

 Therefore, E must not be at 5? N must not be at 4? 

 So ""UNITE"": 
 Position 1: U 
 Position 2: N -> new
 Position 3: I
 Position 4: T
 Position 5: E -> but we cannot put E at 5? It's disallowed.

 So ""UNITE"" is not acceptable.

 Therefore, let us use ""BEGIN"": 
 Positions: 
 1: B 
 2: E (previously E at 5, now at 2 -> new)
 3: G
 4: I
 5: N (previously N at 4, now at 5 -> new)

 So ""BEGIN"" can be tried.

 Alternatively, ""SINEW"": 
 1: S
 2: I
 3: N (new)
 4: E (new)
 5: W

 Both are acceptable.

 But note: there is also the possibility that the secret word might have repeated letters? But Wordle words are usually without duplicate letters? But let's assume no duplicates for now.

 I think either ""BEGIN"" or ""SINEW"" would be fine. Let's choose ""BEGIN"" because it places E at 2 and N at 5? Alternatively, perhaps we can choose a word that also uses the letter T? T is a common letter.

 Since T is common, maybe we should include T? But then we have to avoid the known incorrect positions and include E and N.

 Word: ""TENNY""? -> duplicate N? Also, T at 1, E at 2, N at 3 and 4? Not so good.

 How about ""BEINT""? Not a common word.

 Word: ""BENTS"": but that's 5 letters? B, E, N, T, S? 
 Positions: 
 1: B
 2: E -> okay (E was at 5, now at 2: new)
 3: N -> okay (N was at 4, now at 3: new)
 4: T
 5: S

 But it has E at 2 and N at 3? Both are new positions? And includes T? Also, ""BENTS"" is a valid word (meaning: plural of bent).

 But actually, we have to avoid duplicate letters? We don't know if the word has duplicates? But typically, Wordle words do not have duplicates? So we can assume no duplicates? Then ""BENTS"" would be acceptable? However, the word ""BENTS"" is not as common? And we might want a more common word.

 Alternatively, ""STENO"": S, T, E, N, O -> 
 E at 3? 
 Positions: 
 1: S
 2: T
 3: E -> not 5th? acceptable
 4: N -> but 4th position is disallowed? We cannot put N at 4? So bad.

 Oh, so we can't put N at 4. Therefore, ""STENO"" not allowed.

 How about ""STEIN"": S, T, E, I, N -> 
 Positions: 
 1: S
 2: T
 3: E -> ok
 4: I
 5: N -> but wait: N is at 5? And we are allowed? 
 However, E is at 3? Also, N is at 5? Both positions are acceptable? Because previously N was at 4 (disallowed) and E at 5 (disallowed). Now N at 5: that's allowed? Because the issue with E at 5? But N at 5? The feedback did not say that position 5 cannot be occupied by N? It said E was at 5 and it is not at 5? But the secret word might have N at 5? We have no reason to avoid N at 5? Only that N cannot be at 4? Similarly, E cannot be at 5? But N at 5? Okay? So we can try? And E at 3? So:

 ""STEIN"": 
 1: S
 2: T
 3: E -> position 3 is new for E? Previously E was at 5? Now at 3? That's acceptable.
 4: I
 5: N -> position 5: previously E was at 5, but now N? This is acceptable? Because the feedback only told us the letter E is not in position 5? It didn't say anything about other letters? We can put N at 5? So yes? But note: the secret word does not have E at 5? But it could have another letter? So yes? 

 However, ""STEIN"" is a valid word? Yes? 

 But let me double-check: 
 For E: we must avoid position 5? But position 5? In STEIN, E is at position 3? So that is safe? 
 For N: we must avoid position 4? In STEIN? N is at position 5? That is safe? 

 Therefore, we can try ""STEIN"".

 But note: STEIN has T and I? 

 Alternatively, consider ""NEIST""? Not a common word? 

 Actually, ""STEIN"" might be acceptable? 

 Or maybe ""STINE"": which is less common?

 But ""STEIN"" is recognized.

 Now, among the possibilities: 
 ""BEGIN"": uses B, E, G, I, N -> letters: B, G, I?
 ""SINEW"": S, I, N, E, W -> S, I, W?
 ""STEIN"": S, T, E, I, N -> S, T, I?

 Since we haven't tested T? And T is very common? Perhaps ""STEIN"" is the best? And it also uses two of the known letters? 

 So let me choose ""STEIN"".

 Alternatively, we might try to cover the vowels? We know the word has E? And possibly other vowels? But A is ruled out? So maybe O, I, U? 

 STEIN has I? 

 So I think ""STEIN"" is a good choice? 

 But also note: We can't use position 4 for N? And in STEIN, N is at 5? Which is acceptable? 

 Therefore, I will go with ""STEIN"".

 But wait: STEIN: 
 Position 3: E? That's fine? 
 Position 5: N? That's fine? 

 We'll get feedback on each position.

 Alternatively, perhaps we can use a word that places E at a position we haven't tried? E was at 5? Now we have at position 2, 3? 

 Let me choose ""STEIN"" as the next guess.

 So the guess is ""STEIN"".

 We'll then get feedback on S, T, E, I, N.

 But note: we haven't tried S, T, I? And we have E and N at new positions.

 So let's go with that.Based on the feedback from the first guess (""crane""):
- C, R, and A are not in the secret word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

For the second guess:
- Must be a valid 5-letter English word.
- Cannot include C, R, or A.
- Must include N and E (but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively).
- Should introduce new, common letters to gather more information.

The word ""stein"" satisfies these conditions:
- Positions: S (1), T (2), E (3), I (4), N (5).
- Places E at position 3 (avoiding position 5).
- Places N at position 5 (avoiding position 4).
- Tests new common letters: S, T, and I.

This guess maximizes information coverage while respecting the known constraints.

<guess>stein</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: stein -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) E(-) I(x) N(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, A are not in the word at all.
- N is in the word but not in position 4 (where it was guessed).
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (where it was guessed).

Second guess: ""stein"" -> S(x), T(-), E(-), I(x), N(✓)
Meaning:
- S is not in the word at all.
- T is in the word but not in position 2 (where it was guessed).
- E is in the word but not in position 3 (where it was guessed). Also, we already knew E is not in position 5.
- I is not in the word at all.
- N is in the word and exactly in position 5 (since it got a checkmark).

So, summarizing:
- Confirmed letters in the word: N (at position 5), E (somewhere, not at pos 3 or 5), T (somewhere, not at pos 2)
- Known absent letters: C, R, A, S, I
- Position constraints:
    - N must be at position 5 (so we know the last letter is N)
    - E cannot be at position 3 or 5 (so possibilities: 1,2,4)
    - T cannot be at position 2 (so possibilities: 1,3,4)

Now, we know the word has E and T, and N at the end. Also, from ""crane"", we have E and N present.

The word now has the pattern: ? ? ? ? N

We need to determine the other letters. Remember, we have 6 guesses total, and this is our third.

We should choose a word that:
1. Ends with N (so position 5 is fixed as N)
2. Contains E (but not at pos 3 or 5? And not at pos 5 since N is there? Actually, position 5 is taken by N, so E must be in 1,2, or 4?)
   But from the feedback of ""stein"", E is not at pos 3? And from ""crane"", E is not at pos 5? So E can be at positions 1, 2, or 4.
3. Contains T (but not at position 2? So T can be at positions 1, 3, or 4)
4. Avoids letters: C, R, A, S, I.

We also need to consider what other letters might be present.

Since we only have two known present letters (besides N): E and T? But note, there might be more? We had a '-' for E and T? And one checkmark for N? And the others were absent? 

But wait, in the first guess, ""crane"" had only N and E present? So there are at least three known letters: E, T, N? But wait, the second guess ""stein"" introduced T? And T was present? So the word must include T? 

However, note that we have 5 positions? We have N fixed at 5? Then positions 1,2,3,4? We know E and T? E must be at one of 1,2,4? T at one of 1,3,4? And then we have two more letters? 

But from the first guess, we had only two letters: N and E? Then we found T? So the word has: E, T, N? And two unknown letters? 

We must be cautious? We don't know the full set of present letters? We only know: E (from first guess), N (from both) and T (from second guess)? But there might be more? 

Also, note: we haven't found all letters? 

Therefore, for the next guess, we should try to include E and T? And put E in one of positions 1,2,4? And T in one of positions 1,3,4? And avoid using any excluded letters (C, R, A, S, I). 

Moreover, we should choose positions to test possible spots? Also, we want to cover common letters? 

Possibly, we can use E and T? And then fill with other common letters that haven't been tried? 

What letters have been tried? 

First guess: C, R, A, N, E? Then second: S, T, E, I, N? 

So tried letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, I? 

Excluded: C, R, A, S, I? 

Known present: N, E, T? 

N is fixed at 5? 

So the word is: [letter1] [letter2] [letter3] [letter4] N

We know E is one of positions 1,2,4? T is one of positions 1,3,4? And positions 1 and 4 might be taken by either? 

Also, letter2 and the remaining position? 

We need a word that satisfies these? 

We can choose a word that sets E and T? And then two new letters? 

But the pattern? 

Let us list possible placements:

Case 1: E at position 1? Then T can be at 3 or 4? 
Case 2: E at position 2? Then T at 3 or 4? 
Case 3: E at position 4? Then T at 1 or 3? 

We can also try to put E and T together? 

Moreover, we want the rest of the letters? We haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? 

But we want common ones? 

Let me form a word:

Option: Put E at position 1? Then the word: E ? ? ? N

Then T? Cannot be at 2? So must be at 3 or 4? 

Word? E.g., E __ T _ N? Or E __ _ T N?

But what words end with TN? 

With ETN? 

Example: ""EATEN""? But E at 1? But A is excluded? We cannot use A? 

""EATEN"": has A -> disallowed?

Another: ""EAGON""? Not a word? And has G? Also, do we try O? 

Perhaps ""ELTON"": E, L, T, O, N -> 
Positions: 
1: E -> but we haven't tested E at position 1? 
2: L? 
3: T -> but T cannot be at position 3? We don't forbid? Actually, we don't know? Previously T was at 2? So we forbid position 2 for T? But 3 is allowed? 
4: O? 
5: N? 

So ""ELTON""? It's a proper noun? Not valid?

Another word: ""EJECT""? But E at both? And J? Also, not five letters? 

Wait, think of standard words: 
Ending with TN: not many? But we have E at 1 and N at 5? 

Perhaps E at 2? Then the word: _ E ? ? N

T? Cannot be at 2? We have E at 2? So T must be at 1,3,4? 
But if we have E at 2? Then T? How about T at 3? 
Pattern: _ E T _ N? 
For example: ""PEATN""? Not a word? 

""METON"": M, E, T, O, N -> 
Positions: 1:M, 2:E, 3:T, 4:O, 5:N -> but wait: T cannot be at position 2? So we are putting T at 3? That's allowed? 
Similarly, E is at 2, which we haven't tried? We know E must be somewhere? But we don't allow E at 2? Actually, we have no constraint? E cannot be at 3 or 5? But at 2 is allowed? 

So ""METON"": 
M? We haven't tried?
E at 2? Which is acceptable? 
T at 3? 
O? 
N at 5? 

If ""METON"" is a valid word? It is a surname? Not common? 

What about ""GETON"": G, E, T, O, N -> same as above? 

""GETON"": valid? Get on? Not a standard word? 

Perhaps a better pattern? With E at position 4? 

Then: _ ? ? E N? 

And T? Must be at 1 or 3? 

If T at 1? T ? ? E N? 
Example: ""TOKEN""? But O? Also, T not at 2? But we don't forbid? 
But O? 

Actually, ""TOKEN"": T, O, K, E, N? 
Positions: 
1:T -> allowed? (since T can be at 1)
2:O? 
3:K? 
4:E? -> E at 4? This position is acceptable? 
5:N? 

But we don't know O? 

Similarly, ""TOTEM"": T, O, T, E, M? Has duplicate T? Not common? 

But ""TOKEN"" is a valid word? And avoids A, C, R, S, I? 

But also, we haven't tried O, K? 

But note: we are trying to get information? 

However, we also note that T and E? 

But let's be systematic: We have the letter T? And E? And we need two other letters? 

What about trying ""TWEEN""? T, W, E, E, N? Duplicate E? Not generally in Wordle? And violates? 

Another idea: We can use the word ""OFTEN""? 
O, F, T, E, N? 
Positions: 
1: O? We don't know? 
2: F? 
3: T? -> T at position 3? Not forbidden? 
4: E? -> This is acceptable? Because E at 4? 
5: N? 

That pattern: 
We have E at 4? And T at 3? And O and F? 

Is O and F allowed? Yes? Because we haven't excluded them? 

Now, consider the constraints? 
We know E must be in the word? We put it at 4? Which is acceptable? 
T? Must be in the word? We put at 3? And we know T cannot be at 2? So position 3 is allowed? 

So ""OFTEN"" is a valid word? Yes? And it tests O and F? 

But note: position 1 and 2? 

Also, we want to test T? But already confirmed? 

Moreover, we can try to place E at a position that might rule in or out? 

But consider the constraints? 

However, note: we also have to remember that in the first guess, we had N? And now we know N is at 5? 

So OFTEN: 
- O? Unknown? 
- F? 
- T? Confirmed? 
- E? Confirmed? 
- N? Confirmed? 

But the word ""OFTEN"" is valid? 

But wait: we know T is present? We are putting T at position 3? 

Now, is there a conflict? 

Alternatively, we may choose a word that does not use O? Since O is a vowel? But we haven't tested? 

What about ""BETON"": B, E, T, O, N -> 
Positions: 
1: B? 
2: E? 
3: T? 
4: O? 
5: N? 

But E is at position 2? That's acceptable? 
T is at position 3? That's acceptable? 

But note: we have to have distinct letters? 

""BETON"" is a word? Yes? A technical term? 

But OFTEN might be more common? 

Another common word: ""TENON""? 
T, E, N, O, N -> duplicate N? Not possible? Usually? 

Another: ""DETON"": D, E, T, O, N? Valid? Not common? 

Alternatively, we can fix E at position 1? 

Word: E, ?, ?, T, N? 
Or E, ?, T, ?, N? 
For example: ""EDGON""? Not a word? 
Or ""EXOTN""? Not a word? 

Alternatively, E at 4? Then T at 1? 
Word: T, ?, ?, E, N? 
For example: ""TUBEN""? Not a word? 
""THEN"": only 4 letters? 

Common: ""TAKEN""? T, A, K, E, N? But A is excluded? 
""TOKEN"": we considered? 

Or ""WOMEN""? W, O, M, E, N -> E at 4? 
Positions: 
1:W? 
2:O? 
3:M? 
4:E? 
5:N? 
And T? But this word doesn't have T? But we know T is in the word? So we must include T? 

We cannot ignore T? 

Therefore, the guess must include T? 

Similarly, we must include E? 

So in the next guess, we must include T and E? 

So how about ""TENOR""? But R? R is excluded? 

Similarly, ""TEETH"" has duplicate E? Not valid? 

""TEENY"": T, E, E, N, Y? Duplicate E? 

So we need common words? 

Consider: 
- E at 1: ET _ _ N? 
Example: ""ETUUN""? Not a word? 

- E at 2: _ E T _ N? 
Example: ""METAL""? But A? Excluded? 
""METRO""? R excluded? 
""METIC"": C excluded? 
""METHS"": S excluded? 
""METES"" has duplicate E? 

But ""METON"" I thought earlier? Or ""GETON""? 

Perhaps ""VETON""? Not a word? 

Alternatively, E at 4? And T at 1? 
Word: T _ _ E N? 
Examples: 
""TABLE"": A excluded? 
""TOKEN"": O? 
""TAKEN"": A excluded? 
""TILED"": I excluded? 
""TYRED"": R? 
""TIMED"": M, D? 
""TOWED"": O, W, E, D? 
But wait: ""TOWED"": T, O, W, E, D? 
Positions: 
1:T? 
2:O? 
3:W? 
4:E? 
5:D? 
This has T? And E? 
Constraints: 
- E at 4? Accepted? 
- T at 1? Accepted? 
- Letters: T, O, W, E, D? 
Excluded? C, R, A, S, I? We don't use? 
So allowed? 
Is ""TOWED"" a word? Yes: past tense of tow? 

But what about the letter D? 

Similarly, ""BAKED"": has A? Excluded? 

So ""TOWED"" is acceptable? 

Also, ""OFFED"": O, F, F, E, D? Duplicate F? Not common? 

But ""TOWED"" has no duplicates? 

Alternatively, E at 4? And T at 3? 
Word: _ ? T E N? 
Examples: 
""GATEN""? Not word? 
""LOTEN""? Not word? 
""KETEN"": K, E, T, E, N? Duplicate E? 
""WETEN""? Not common? 

Therefore, suitable words include: ""TOKEN"", ""OFTEN"", ""TOWED"", ""BETON"", etc.

Now, which one gives the most coverage? 
- ""OFTEN"": includes O, F, T, E, N? T and E we already know? So testing O and F?
- ""TOKEN"": T, O, K, E, N? Testing O and K?
- ""TOWED"": T, O, W, E, D? Testing O, W, D? 

We want to test letters that haven't been tried? 

Previously tried letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, I? 
So new ones in ""OFTEN"": O, F? 
In ""TOKEN"": O, K? 
In ""TOWED"": O, W, D? 

""TOWED"" tests three new letters? But one of them is a vowel? 

But note: we have only one E? But we are including E? 

But E and T and N are confirmed? So we are only getting information about O, W, D? 

Similarly, ""OFTEN"" tests O and F? 

Perhaps ""OFTEN"" might be more common? Or we can choose one? 

Consider that we might also get position constraints? 

But I think ""OFTEN"" is a good candidate? Because it has common letters? 

Alternatively, we can choose ""OZONE""? O, Z, O, N, E -> duplicate O? Also, no T? 

But we have to include T? 

Another idea: Why not try ""PUTEN""? Not a word? 

I think we must include T. 

So, let me choose ""OFTEN"". 

It meets all constraints? 
- O? not excluded? 
- F? not excluded? 
- T? at position 3? not at 2? acceptable? 
- E? at position 4? acceptable? 
- N? at position 5? fixed? 

And the pattern: O F T E N? So positions: 
1: O 
2: F 
3: T 
4: E 
5: N 

This should be valid? 

We'll then get feedback? 

If there are problems? For example, if O or F are absent? Then we can know? 

But note: there is a possibility that E is actually at position 1? Then putting E at position 4 might be wrong? But we are trying to test? 

If the word is, say, ""TEPID""? But we know I is excluded? 

So let me go with ""OFTEN"". 

We'll get its feedback? 

So our guess is ""often"". 

But wait: the word ""OFTEN"" has E at 4? But we haven't tried E at 1? That's okay? 

If the secret word has E at 1? Then ""OFTEN"" would show E as not? But it is in the word? So we would get '-' for E? And then we know E is not at 4? 

Similarly? 

I think it's acceptable? Of course, a word that has E at 1 and T at 3? Would be? 

For example: E _ T _ N? 
What words? ""ETTIN""? Not common? 
""EMPTN"" not valid? 
So probably rare? 

I think ""OFTEN"" is reasonable.

Alternatively, to explicitly test E at 1? We have to use a word that starts with E? 

But then also includes T? So: E _ ? T N? Not many common words? 

Example: ""ENTT..."" -> but position 5 is N? 

""ENTMT""? Not valid? 

So start with E? Third letter T? And fifth N: E ? T ? N? 

Words: ""EATON"": A excluded? 
""ESTON"": S excluded? 
But nothing? 

Therefore, we choose ""OFTEN"". 

Summary:
- Guess: ""often""
- Pattern: O F T E N
- Tests absent letters: O, F
- Adheres to constraints: E at position 4 (allowed); T at position 3 (allowed, since we only know T cannot be at position 2).

<guess>often</guess>After analyzing the feedback:

1. From ""crane"" (C: absent, R: absent, A: absent, N: present but wrong position, E: present but wrong position):
   - Excluded letters: C, R, A.
   - Confirmed letters: N (must be present, not position 4) and E (must be present, not position 5).

2. From ""stein"" (S: absent, T: present but wrong position, E: present but wrong position, I: absent, N: correct position):
   - Excluded letters: S, I.
   - Confirmed letters: T (present, not position 2) and E (confirmed present again, not position 3).
   - N is locked in position 5.

Constraints:
- Secret word structure: ? ? ? ? N
- E must be in position 1, 2, or 4 (not 3 or 5).
- T must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (not 2).
- Must include E and T (besides N).
- Excluded letters: A, C, I, R, S.

New guess considerations:
- Focus on placing E and T in allowed positions while testing new letters.
- Try ""often"": 
  - Ends with N (position 5).
  - E at position 4 (allowed).
  - T at position 3 (allowed).
  - Introduces O and F (common letters, not excluded).
- This tests E position 4, T position 3, and verifies O/F presence.

This guess maximizes information by targeting E/T placement constraints and exploring new letters.

We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.\n A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.\n Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.\n\n Let\'s choose ""CRANE"" as it is a popular starting word. It has three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).\n\n So, our first guess will be: CRANE\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"": \n C: x (not in the word)\n R: x (not in the word)\n A: x (not in the word)\n N: - (in the word, but wrong position)\n E: - (in the word, but wrong position)\n\n So, the secret word does not contain C, R, A. But it does contain N and E, but not in the positions they were guessed.\n Since ""crane"" had N at the 4th position and E at the 5th, that means in the secret word:\n - N is not in the 4th position, but it\'s somewhere else.\n - E is not in the 5th position, but it\'s somewhere else.\n\n We also know the secret word does not have C, R, A.\n\n Now, for the next guess, we should choose a word that:\n 1. Does not contain C, R, A (since they are not in the word).\n 2. Contains N and E (since they are in the word).\n 3. Places N and E in different positions than the first guess (so not N at position 4 or E at position 5).\n\n Moreover, we want to test other common letters to get more information.\n\n Considering the feedback, let\'s think of a word that meets the criteria.\n\n Options for letters: Since we have removed C, R, A, we are left with other consonants and vowels.\n\n We know the secret word has N and E. Let\'s list possible words? That might be too many, but we can choose a word that uses common letters.\n\n Common consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n Vowels: We have E (already known) and possibly others, but A is out. So vowels available: E, I, O, U (and sometimes Y).\n\n We also know that the word is 5 letters.\n\n Let\'s try to pick a word that includes N and E, and avoids C, R, A, and places N and E in new positions.\n\n Since N was in position 4 and E in position 5, we can put them in positions such as:\n N: position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but 5 was E\'s position? but E was at 5 and now we can try N elsewhere? Actually, we know N is not at 4, but it can be at 5? Similarly E can be at 4?).\n\n Let me try to form a word.\n\n Example: We could try ""LENS"" but that\'s 4 letters. We need 5.\n\n Possibilities: \n - Let me try to put E at a different position, say position 3? Then N could be at position 2?\n\n Word: ""MINES"" -> has I, M, N, E, S. But we don\'t know if I, M, S are in the word? And note: E at position 5? But in our first guess E was at position 5 and now we are avoiding the same position? Actually, we are allowed to try E at position 5 again? But feedback told us E is not at position 5. So we must place E at positions 1,2,3,4? Similarly N must be placed at positions 1,2,3,5.\n\n We cannot put E at position 5? So we must use E in positions 1-4? Similarly, N cannot be at position 4? So N can be at positions 1,2,3,5.\n\n Now, we want to maximize learning other letters. So we can use letters that are common and haven\'t been tested.\n\n We also know that we must avoid C, R, A.\n\n Another idea: Use a word that has both E and N, and three new letters (which aren\'t C, R, A).\n\n Possible words: \n - ""LINES"": has L, I, N, E, S. \n   Positions: N is at 3? We need to assign: \n   Let me define: position 1: L, 2: I, 3: N, 4: E, 5: S.\n   But wait: N is at position 3 (which is new) and E at position 4 (also new). This seems acceptable.\n\n But is ""LINES"" a valid word? Yes.\n\n Alternatively, ""TENOR"": has T, E, N, O, R -> but R is already ruled out! So we cannot use R.\n\n Since R is not in the word, we must avoid R. Similarly, A and C are not in the word.\n\n So ""TENOR"" has R -> that\'s not allowed.\n\n Another word: ""MINCE"" -> has C? C is ruled out -> no.\n\n Word: ""BENCH"" -> has C: disallowed.\n\n How about ""STONE"": \n - S, T, O, N, E -> positions: N at 4? But in the first guess, N was at 4 and we must avoid position 4 for N? Actually, we cannot put N at position 4? Because the feedback said N is not at position 4? So in ""STONE"", N is at position 4: that would be the same position? We are not supposed to repeat a known incorrect position? We can\'t use N at position 4 because we know it\'s not there.\n\n So: avoid placing N at position 4.\n\n ""STONE"" -> N is at position 4 -> not allowed.\n\n Alternative: ""SETON"" -> but that might not be common? And E is at position 2, N at position 5? That\'s acceptable.\n\n But let\'s think of more common words.\n\n Word: ""SINEW"": S, I, N, E, W.\n Positions: \n 1. S\n 2. I\n 3. N\n 4. E\n 5. W\n\n Notice: \n - N is at position 3 (it was at 4 -> now changed to 3 -> new)\n - E is at position 4 (it was at 5 -> now at 4 -> new)\n\n This avoids the positions we know are incorrect.\n\n Also, the letters S, I, W haven\'t been tried.\n\n So ""SINEW"" seems a good candidate.\n\n Another common word: ""OPINE"": O, P, I, N, E -> \n Positions: N at 4? But we cannot have N at position 4? So this is bad.\n\n Another: ""QUIET"" -> but no N? We must include N and E.\n\n We must include both N and E.\n\n Another option: ""DEIGN"": D, E, I, G, N -> \n Positions: \n 1: D\n 2: E (E was previously at 5, now at 2 -> new)\n 3: I\n 4: G\n 5: N (N was at 4, now at 5 -> new)\n\n This seems acceptable: E is at 2, N at 5.\n\n But ""DEIGN"" is a word? Yes. Also, it tests D, I, G.\n\n But note: We have to use valid English words.\n\n Alternatively, ""BEGIN"": B, E, G, I, N -> \n Positions: E at 2, N at 5 -> same as above? But avoids A, C, R.\n\n However, ""BEGIN"" uses B and G? And we haven\'t tried them.\n\n Now, comparing ""SINEW"" and ""BEGIN"": \n ""SINEW"" has S, I, N, E, W -> S and W are new.\n ""BEGIN"" has B, E, G, I, N -> B and G are new.\n\n They are both fine. Which one gives more common letters? \n\n Since we want to cover more common letters, let\'s look at frequency in English words.\n\n Common letters: E, T, N, ... but we know E and N are in. Then S is very common. So perhaps ""SINEW"" is better?\n\n Another possibility: ""OWING"" -> O, W, I, N, G -> missing E? Must have E, so no.\n\n Similarly, ""FEINT"": F, E, I, N, T -> \n Positions: E at 2, N at 4? We cannot use N at 4 -> so bad? Actually, N is at 5? ""FEINT"": \n 1: F\n 2: E\n 3: I\n 4: N -> position 4? Not allowed for N? We cannot put N at position 4.\n\n Let\'s check: the first guess was ""crane"" -> N at position 4. The secret word has N but not at position 4. So we cannot use that position.\n\n Therefore, ""FEINT"" would have N at position 4 -> not allowed. So skip.\n\n Consider ""UNITE"": U, N, I, T, E -> \n Positions: N at position 2, E at position 5? \n But wait: in our first guess, E was at position 5? We also cannot have E at position 5? So we cannot put E at 5? And N at 2? \n Actually, the feedback told us E is not at position 5? So we must avoid E at position 5? \n Similarly, we must avoid N at position 4? \n\n Therefore, E must not be at 5? N must not be at 4? \n\n So ""UNITE"": \n Position 1: U \n Position 2: N -> new\n Position 3: I\n Position 4: T\n Position 5: E -> but we cannot put E at 5? It\'s disallowed.\n\n So ""UNITE"" is not acceptable.\n\n Therefore, let us use ""BEGIN"": \n Positions: \n 1: B \n 2: E (previously E at 5, now at 2 -> new)\n 3: G\n 4: I\n 5: N (previously N at 4, now at 5 -> new)\n\n So ""BEGIN"" can be tried.\n\n Alternatively, ""SINEW"": \n 1: S\n 2: I\n 3: N (new)\n 4: E (new)\n 5: W\n\n Both are acceptable.\n\n But note: there is also the possibility that the secret word might have repeated letters? But Wordle words are usually without duplicate letters? But let\'s assume no duplicates for now.\n\n I think either ""BEGIN"" or ""SINEW"" would be fine. Let\'s choose ""BEGIN"" because it places E at 2 and N at 5? Alternatively, perhaps we can choose a word that also uses the letter T? T is a common letter.\n\n Since T is common, maybe we should include T? But then we have to avoid the known incorrect positions and include E and N.\n\n Word: ""TENNY""? -> duplicate N? Also, T at 1, E at 2, N at 3 and 4? Not so good.\n\n How about ""BEINT""? Not a common word.\n\n Word: ""BENTS"": but that\'s 5 letters? B, E, N, T, S? \n Positions: \n 1: B\n 2: E -> okay (E was at 5, now at 2: new)\n 3: N -> okay (N was at 4, now at 3: new)\n 4: T\n 5: S\n\n But it has E at 2 and N at 3? Both are new positions? And includes T? Also, ""BENTS"" is a valid word (meaning: plural of bent).\n\n But actually, we have to avoid duplicate letters? We don\'t know if the word has duplicates? But typically, Wordle words do not have duplicates? So we can assume no duplicates? Then ""BENTS"" would be acceptable? However, the word ""BENTS"" is not as common? And we might want a more common word.\n\n Alternatively, ""STENO"": S, T, E, N, O -> \n E at 3? \n Positions: \n 1: S\n 2: T\n 3: E -> not 5th? acceptable\n 4: N -> but 4th position is disallowed? We cannot put N at 4? So bad.\n\n Oh, so we can\'t put N at 4. Therefore, ""STENO"" not allowed.\n\n How about ""STEIN"": S, T, E, I, N -> \n Positions: \n 1: S\n 2: T\n 3: E -> ok\n 4: I\n 5: N -> but wait: N is at 5? And we are allowed? \n However, E is at 3? Also, N is at 5? Both positions are acceptable? Because previously N was at 4 (disallowed) and E at 5 (disallowed). Now N at 5: that\'s allowed? Because the issue with E at 5? But N at 5? The feedback did not say that position 5 cannot be occupied by N? It said E was at 5 and it is not at 5? But the secret word might have N at 5? We have no reason to avoid N at 5? Only that N cannot be at 4? Similarly, E cannot be at 5? But N at 5? Okay? So we can try? And E at 3? So:\n\n ""STEIN"": \n 1: S\n 2: T\n 3: E -> position 3 is new for E? Previously E was at 5? Now at 3? That\'s acceptable.\n 4: I\n 5: N -> position 5: previously E was at 5, but now N? This is acceptable? Because the feedback only told us the letter E is not in position 5? It didn\'t say anything about other letters? We can put N at 5? So yes? But note: the secret word does not have E at 5? But it could have another letter? So yes? \n\n However, ""STEIN"" is a valid word? Yes? \n\n But let me double-check: \n For E: we must avoid position 5? But position 5? In STEIN, E is at position 3? So that is safe? \n For N: we must avoid position 4? In STEIN? N is at position 5? That is safe? \n\n Therefore, we can try ""STEIN"".\n\n But note: STEIN has T and I? \n\n Alternatively, consider ""NEIST""? Not a common word? \n\n Actually, ""STEIN"" might be acceptable? \n\n Or maybe ""STINE"": which is less common?\n\n But ""STEIN"" is recognized.\n\n Now, among the possibilities: \n ""BEGIN"": uses B, E, G, I, N -> letters: B, G, I?\n ""SINEW"": S, I, N, E, W -> S, I, W?\n ""STEIN"": S, T, E, I, N -> S, T, I?\n\n Since we haven\'t tested T? And T is very common? Perhaps ""STEIN"" is the best? And it also uses two of the known letters? \n\n So let me choose ""STEIN"".\n\n Alternatively, we might try to cover the vowels? We know the word has E? And possibly other vowels? But A is ruled out? So maybe O, I, U? \n\n STEIN has I? \n\n So I think ""STEIN"" is a good choice? \n\n But also note: We can\'t use position 4 for N? And in STEIN, N is at 5? Which is acceptable? \n\n Therefore, I will go with ""STEIN"".\n\n But wait: STEIN: \n Position 3: E? That\'s fine? \n Position 5: N? That\'s fine? \n\n We\'ll get feedback on each position.\n\n Alternatively, perhaps we can use a word that places E at a position we haven\'t tried? E was at 5? Now we have at position 2, 3? \n\n Let me choose ""STEIN"" as the next guess.\n\n So the guess is ""STEIN"".\n\n We\'ll then get feedback on S, T, E, I, N.\n\n But note: we haven\'t tried S, T, I? And we have E and N at new positions.\n\n So let\'s go with that.Based on the feedback from the first guess (""crane""):\n- C, R, and A are not in the secret word.\n- N is in the word but not in position 4.\n- E is in the word but not in position 5.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Must be a valid 5-letter English word.\n- Cannot include C, R, or A.\n- Must include N and E (but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively).\n- Should introduce new, common letters to gather more information.\n\nThe word ""stein"" satisfies these conditions:\n- Positions: S (1), T (2), E (3), I (4), N (5).\n- Places E at position 3 (avoiding position 5).\n- Places N at position 5 (avoiding position 4).\n- Tests new common letters: S, T, and I.\n\nThis guess maximizes information coverage while respecting the known constraints.\n\n<guess>stein</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: stein -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) E(-) I(x) N(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from two guesses:\n\nFirst guess: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-)\nMeaning:\n- C, R, A are not in the word at all.\n- N is in the word but not in position 4 (where it was guessed).\n- E is in the word but not in position 5 (where it was guessed).\n\nSecond guess: ""stein"" -> S(x), T(-), E(-), I(x), N(✓)\nMeaning:\n- S is not in the word at all.\n- T is in the word but not in position 2 (where it was guessed).\n- E is in the word but not in position 3 (where it was guessed). Also, we already knew E is not in position 5.\n- I is not in the word at all.\n- N is in the word and exactly in position 5 (since it got a checkmark).\n\nSo, summarizing:\n- Confirmed letters in the word: N (at position 5), E (somewhere, not at pos 3 or 5), T (somewhere, not at pos 2)\n- Known absent letters: C, R, A, S, I\n- Position constraints:\n    - N must be at position 5 (so we know the last letter is N)\n    - E cannot be at position 3 or 5 (so possibilities: 1,2,4)\n    - T cannot be at position 2 (so possibilities: 1,3,4)\n\nNow, we know the word has E and T, and N at the end. Also, from ""crane"", we have E and N present.\n\nThe word now has the pattern: ? ? ? ? N\n\nWe need to determine the other letters. Remember, we have 6 guesses total, and this is our third.\n\nWe should choose a word that:\n1. Ends with N (so position 5 is fixed as N)\n2. Contains E (but not at pos 3 or 5? And not at pos 5 since N is there? Actually, position 5 is taken by N, so E must be in 1,2, or 4?)\n   But from the feedback of ""stein"", E is not at pos 3? And from ""crane"", E is not at pos 5? So E can be at positions 1, 2, or 4.\n3. Contains T (but not at position 2? So T can be at positions 1, 3, or 4)\n4. Avoids letters: C, R, A, S, I.\n\nWe also need to consider what other letters might be present.\n\nSince we only have two known present letters (besides N): E and T? But note, there might be more? We had a \'-\' for E and T? And one checkmark for N? And the others were absent? \n\nBut wait, in the first guess, ""crane"" had only N and E present? So there are at least three known letters: E, T, N? But wait, the second guess ""stein"" introduced T? And T was present? So the word must include T? \n\nHowever, note that we have 5 positions? We have N fixed at 5? Then positions 1,2,3,4? We know E and T? E must be at one of 1,2,4? T at one of 1,3,4? And then we have two more letters? \n\nBut from the first guess, we had only two letters: N and E? Then we found T? So the word has: E, T, N? And two unknown letters? \n\nWe must be cautious? We don\'t know the full set of present letters? We only know: E (from first guess), N (from both) and T (from second guess)? But there might be more? \n\nAlso, note: we haven\'t found all letters? \n\nTherefore, for the next guess, we should try to include E and T? And put E in one of positions 1,2,4? And T in one of positions 1,3,4? And avoid using any excluded letters (C, R, A, S, I). \n\nMoreover, we should choose positions to test possible spots? Also, we want to cover common letters? \n\nPossibly, we can use E and T? And then fill with other common letters that haven\'t been tried? \n\nWhat letters have been tried? \n\nFirst guess: C, R, A, N, E? Then second: S, T, E, I, N? \n\nSo tried letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, I? \n\nExcluded: C, R, A, S, I? \n\nKnown present: N, E, T? \n\nN is fixed at 5? \n\nSo the word is: [letter1] [letter2] [letter3] [letter4] N\n\nWe know E is one of positions 1,2,4? T is one of positions 1,3,4? And positions 1 and 4 might be taken by either? \n\nAlso, letter2 and the remaining position? \n\nWe need a word that satisfies these? \n\nWe can choose a word that sets E and T? And then two new letters? \n\nBut the pattern? \n\nLet us list possible placements:\n\nCase 1: E at position 1? Then T can be at 3 or 4? \nCase 2: E at position 2? Then T at 3 or 4? \nCase 3: E at position 4? Then T at 1 or 3? \n\nWe can also try to put E and T together? \n\nMoreover, we want the rest of the letters? We haven\'t tried: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? \n\nBut we want common ones? \n\nLet me form a word:\n\nOption: Put E at position 1? Then the word: E ? ? ? N\n\nThen T? Cannot be at 2? So must be at 3 or 4? \n\nWord? E.g., E __ T _ N? Or E __ _ T N?\n\nBut what words end with TN? \n\nWith ETN? \n\nExample: ""EATEN""? But E at 1? But A is excluded? We cannot use A? \n\n""EATEN"": has A -> disallowed?\n\nAnother: ""EAGON""? Not a word? And has G? Also, do we try O? \n\nPerhaps ""ELTON"": E, L, T, O, N -> \nPositions: \n1: E -> but we haven\'t tested E at position 1? \n2: L? \n3: T -> but T cannot be at position 3? We don\'t forbid? Actually, we don\'t know? Previously T was at 2? So we forbid position 2 for T? But 3 is allowed? \n4: O? \n5: N? \n\nSo ""ELTON""? It\'s a proper noun? Not valid?\n\nAnother word: ""EJECT""? But E at both? And J? Also, not five letters? \n\nWait, think of standard words: \nEnding with TN: not many? But we have E at 1 and N at 5? \n\nPerhaps E at 2? Then the word: _ E ? ? N\n\nT? Cannot be at 2? We have E at 2? So T must be at 1,3,4? \nBut if we have E at 2? Then T? How about T at 3? \nPattern: _ E T _ N? \nFor example: ""PEATN""? Not a word? \n\n""METON"": M, E, T, O, N -> \nPositions: 1:M, 2:E, 3:T, 4:O, 5:N -> but wait: T cannot be at position 2? So we are putting T at 3? That\'s allowed? \nSimilarly, E is at 2, which we haven\'t tried? We know E must be somewhere? But we don\'t allow E at 2? Actually, we have no constraint? E cannot be at 3 or 5? But at 2 is allowed? \n\nSo ""METON"": \nM? We haven\'t tried?\nE at 2? Which is acceptable? \nT at 3? \nO? \nN at 5? \n\nIf ""METON"" is a valid word? It is a surname? Not common? \n\nWhat about ""GETON"": G, E, T, O, N -> same as above? \n\n""GETON"": valid? Get on? Not a standard word? \n\nPerhaps a better pattern? With E at position 4? \n\nThen: _ ? ? E N? \n\nAnd T? Must be at 1 or 3? \n\nIf T at 1? T ? ? E N? \nExample: ""TOKEN""? But O? Also, T not at 2? But we don\'t forbid? \nBut O? \n\nActually, ""TOKEN"": T, O, K, E, N? \nPositions: \n1:T -> allowed? (since T can be at 1)\n2:O? \n3:K? \n4:E? -> E at 4? This position is acceptable? \n5:N? \n\nBut we don\'t know O? \n\nSimilarly, ""TOTEM"": T, O, T, E, M? Has duplicate T? Not common? \n\nBut ""TOKEN"" is a valid word? And avoids A, C, R, S, I? \n\nBut also, we haven\'t tried O, K? \n\nBut note: we are trying to get information? \n\nHowever, we also note that T and E? \n\nBut let\'s be systematic: We have the letter T? And E? And we need two other letters? \n\nWhat about trying ""TWEEN""? T, W, E, E, N? Duplicate E? Not generally in Wordle? And violates? \n\nAnother idea: We can use the word ""OFTEN""? \nO, F, T, E, N? \nPositions: \n1: O? We don\'t know? \n2: F? \n3: T? -> T at position 3? Not forbidden? \n4: E? -> This is acceptable? Because E at 4? \n5: N? \n\nThat pattern: \nWe have E at 4? And T at 3? And O and F? \n\nIs O and F allowed? Yes? Because we haven\'t excluded them? \n\nNow, consider the constraints? \nWe know E must be in the word? We put it at 4? Which is acceptable? \nT? Must be in the word? We put at 3? And we know T cannot be at 2? So position 3 is allowed? \n\nSo ""OFTEN"" is a valid word? Yes? And it tests O and F? \n\nBut note: position 1 and 2? \n\nAlso, we want to test T? But already confirmed? \n\nMoreover, we can try to place E at a position that might rule in or out? \n\nBut consider the constraints? \n\nHowever, note: we also have to remember that in the first guess, we had N? And now we know N is at 5? \n\nSo OFTEN: \n- O? Unknown? \n- F? \n- T? Confirmed? \n- E? Confirmed? \n- N? Confirmed? \n\nBut the word ""OFTEN"" is valid? \n\nBut wait: we know T is present? We are putting T at position 3? \n\nNow, is there a conflict? \n\nAlternatively, we may choose a word that does not use O? Since O is a vowel? But we haven\'t tested? \n\nWhat about ""BETON"": B, E, T, O, N -> \nPositions: \n1: B? \n2: E? \n3: T? \n4: O? \n5: N? \n\nBut E is at position 2? That\'s acceptable? \nT is at position 3? That\'s acceptable? \n\nBut note: we have to have distinct letters? \n\n""BETON"" is a word? Yes? A technical term? \n\nBut OFTEN might be more common? \n\nAnother common word: ""TENON""? \nT, E, N, O, N -> duplicate N? Not possible? Usually? \n\nAnother: ""DETON"": D, E, T, O, N? Valid? Not common? \n\nAlternatively, we can fix E at position 1? \n\nWord: E, ?, ?, T, N? \nOr E, ?, T, ?, N? \nFor example: ""EDGON""? Not a word? \nOr ""EXOTN""? Not a word? \n\nAlternatively, E at 4? Then T at 1? \nWord: T, ?, ?, E, N? \nFor example: ""TUBEN""? Not a word? \n""THEN"": only 4 letters? \n\nCommon: ""TAKEN""? T, A, K, E, N? But A is excluded? \n""TOKEN"": we considered? \n\nOr ""WOMEN""? W, O, M, E, N -> E at 4? \nPositions: \n1:W? \n2:O? \n3:M? \n4:E? \n5:N? \nAnd T? But this word doesn\'t have T? But we know T is in the word? So we must include T? \n\nWe cannot ignore T? \n\nTherefore, the guess must include T? \n\nSimilarly, we must include E? \n\nSo in the next guess, we must include T and E? \n\nSo how about ""TENOR""? But R? R is excluded? \n\nSimilarly, ""TEETH"" has duplicate E? Not valid? \n\n""TEENY"": T, E, E, N, Y? Duplicate E? \n\nSo we need common words? \n\nConsider: \n- E at 1: ET _ _ N? \nExample: ""ETUUN""? Not a word? \n\n- E at 2: _ E T _ N? \nExample: ""METAL""? But A? Excluded? \n""METRO""? R excluded? \n""METIC"": C excluded? \n""METHS"": S excluded? \n""METES"" has duplicate E? \n\nBut ""METON"" I thought earlier? Or ""GETON""? \n\nPerhaps ""VETON""? Not a word? \n\nAlternatively, E at 4? And T at 1? \nWord: T _ _ E N? \nExamples: \n""TABLE"": A excluded? \n""TOKEN"": O? \n""TAKEN"": A excluded? \n""TILED"": I excluded? \n""TYRED"": R? \n""TIMED"": M, D? \n""TOWED"": O, W, E, D? \nBut wait: ""TOWED"": T, O, W, E, D? \nPositions: \n1:T? \n2:O? \n3:W? \n4:E? \n5:D? \nThis has T? And E? \nConstraints: \n- E at 4? Accepted? \n- T at 1? Accepted? \n- Letters: T, O, W, E, D? \nExcluded? C, R, A, S, I? We don\'t use? \nSo allowed? \nIs ""TOWED"" a word? Yes: past tense of tow? \n\nBut what about the letter D? \n\nSimilarly, ""BAKED"": has A? Excluded? \n\nSo ""TOWED"" is acceptable? \n\nAlso, ""OFFED"": O, F, F, E, D? Duplicate F? Not common? \n\nBut ""TOWED"" has no duplicates? \n\nAlternatively, E at 4? And T at 3? \nWord: _ ? T E N? \nExamples: \n""GATEN""? Not word? \n""LOTEN""? Not word? \n""KETEN"": K, E, T, E, N? Duplicate E? \n""WETEN""? Not common? \n\nTherefore, suitable words include: ""TOKEN"", ""OFTEN"", ""TOWED"", ""BETON"", etc.\n\nNow, which one gives the most coverage? \n- ""OFTEN"": includes O, F, T, E, N? T and E we already know? So testing O and F?\n- ""TOKEN"": T, O, K, E, N? Testing O and K?\n- ""TOWED"": T, O, W, E, D? Testing O, W, D? \n\nWe want to test letters that haven\'t been tried? \n\nPreviously tried letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, I? \nSo new ones in ""OFTEN"": O, F? \nIn ""TOKEN"": O, K? \nIn ""TOWED"": O, W, D? \n\n""TOWED"" tests three new letters? But one of them is a vowel? \n\nBut note: we have only one E? But we are including E? \n\nBut E and T and N are confirmed? So we are only getting information about O, W, D? \n\nSimilarly, ""OFTEN"" tests O and F? \n\nPerhaps ""OFTEN"" might be more common? Or we can choose one? \n\nConsider that we might also get position constraints? \n\nBut I think ""OFTEN"" is a good candidate? Because it has common letters? \n\nAlternatively, we can choose ""OZONE""? O, Z, O, N, E -> duplicate O? Also, no T? \n\nBut we have to include T? \n\nAnother idea: Why not try ""PUTEN""? Not a word? \n\nI think we must include T. \n\nSo, let me choose ""OFTEN"". \n\nIt meets all constraints? \n- O? not excluded? \n- F? not excluded? \n- T? at position 3? not at 2? acceptable? \n- E? at position 4? acceptable? \n- N? at position 5? fixed? \n\nAnd the pattern: O F T E N? So positions: \n1: O \n2: F \n3: T \n4: E \n5: N \n\nThis should be valid? \n\nWe\'ll then get feedback? \n\nIf there are problems? For example, if O or F are absent? Then we can know? \n\nBut note: there is a possibility that E is actually at position 1? Then putting E at position 4 might be wrong? But we are trying to test? \n\nIf the word is, say, ""TEPID""? But we know I is excluded? \n\nSo let me go with ""OFTEN"". \n\nWe\'ll get its feedback? \n\nSo our guess is ""often"". \n\nBut wait: the word ""OFTEN"" has E at 4? But we haven\'t tried E at 1? That\'s okay? \n\nIf the secret word has E at 1? Then ""OFTEN"" would show E as not? But it is in the word? So we would get \'-\' for E? And then we know E is not at 4? \n\nSimilarly? \n\nI think it\'s acceptable? Of course, a word that has E at 1 and T at 3? Would be? \n\nFor example: E _ T _ N? \nWhat words? ""ETTIN""? Not common? \n""EMPTN"" not valid? \nSo probably rare? \n\nI think ""OFTEN"" is reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, to explicitly test E at 1? We have to use a word that starts with E? \n\nBut then also includes T? So: E _ ? T N? Not many common words? \n\nExample: ""ENTT..."" -> but position 5 is N? \n\n""ENTMT""? Not valid? \n\nSo start with E? Third letter T? And fifth N: E ? T ? N? \n\nWords: ""EATON"": A excluded? \n""ESTON"": S excluded? \nBut nothing? \n\nTherefore, we choose ""OFTEN"". \n\nSummary:\n- Guess: ""often""\n- Pattern: O F T E N\n- Tests absent letters: O, F\n- Adheres to constraints: E at position 4 (allowed); T at position 3 (allowed, since we only know T cannot be at position 2).\n\n<guess>often</guess>After analyzing the feedback:\n\n1.

We are given feedback from three guesses:

First guess: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, A are not in the word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Second guess: ""stein"" -> S(x), T(-), E(-), I(x), N(✓)
Meaning:
- S and I are not in the word.
- T is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 3.
- N is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

Third guess: ""often"" -> O(-), F(x), T(-), E(✓), N(✓)
Meaning:
- O is in the word but not in position 1 (since we got '-' for O at position 1).
- F is not in the word.
- T is in the word but not in position 3 (where it was guessed).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- N is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So, summarizing:
- Correct positions: 
  - Position 4: E
  - Position 5: N
- Known present letters (but position not fully known): 
  - T: present, but not in position 2 (from ""stein"") and not in position 3 (from ""often"")
  - O: present, but not in position 1 (from ""often"")
- Known absent letters: A, C, F, I, R, S
- Letters that must be in the word: E, N, T, O (and we have two more letters? But we have positions 1,2,3 to fill? But we have E at 4 and N at 5, so positions 1,2,3 are unknown? But we know T and O are present? So the word has at least T, O, E, N? And one more letter? Because 5 letters? So we have 4 letters: T, O, E, N? And one more? 

But note: we have 5 positions: 
Position 1: unknown
Position 2: unknown
Position 3: unknown
Position 4: E
Position 5: N

We know the word contains T and O? And we have three positions (1,2,3) to fill? But we have two letters (T and O) and one more letter? 

So the word is: [letter1] [letter2] [letter3] E N

We know:
- T is in the word? But not at position 2 or 3? So T must be at position 1? Because positions 4 and 5 are E and N? So the only possibility for T is position 1? 
  - Because T cannot be at 2 or 3? And 4 and 5 are taken? So T must be at position 1? 
- O is in the word? But not at position 1? So O must be at position 2 or 3? 

Also, we have one more letter? Let's call it X? So the word is: T [O or X] [O or X] E N? But we have only one O? So the word must be: T O ? E N or T ? O E N? 

But we have to have one more letter? 

So the word is: T _ _ E N? But we have two positions? 

Wait: positions: 
1: must be T? Because T is present and the only position left? 
2: ? 
3: ? 
4: E 
5: N 

But we have O? Which must be at position 2 or 3? 

So the word is: T [O or ?] [O or ?] E N? 

But we have two positions? And we know O is present? So one of position 2 or 3 is O? The other is an unknown letter? 

But we also have to consider that we have only one O? 

Now, what about the unknown letter? 

We have tried letters: 
- From ""crane"": C, R, A, N, E -> excluded: C, R, A; present: N, E
- From ""stein"": S, T, E, I, N -> excluded: S, I; present: T (and confirmed E and N)
- From ""often"": O, F, T, E, N -> excluded: F; present: O (and confirmed E and N, and T again)

So absent letters: A, C, F, I, R, S

Present letters: T, O, E, N? And one more? 

But we have five letters? So the fifth letter must be one we haven't tried? 

We have positions 2 and 3? One is O? The other is an unknown letter? 

So the word is: T (position1) and then at position2 and 3: one is O and the other is a new letter? 

Now, we need to find a 5-letter word that starts with T, ends with EN, and has O in the middle? 

Pattern: T ? ? E N? 

With one of the ? being O? 

And the other being a letter not in {A, C, F, I, R, S}? 

Also, we know that O is not at position 1? But we have T at 1? So that's fine? 

Now, let's list possible words? 

First, if O is at position 2: T O ? E N? 
What words? 
- ""TOKEN"": T O K E N? 
  - But we have K? 
  - And we haven't tried K? 
  - Also, O at 2? 
  - But note: in ""often"", we had O at position 1? And we got '-' meaning O is present but not at 1? So O at 2 is allowed? 
  - But is ""TOKEN"" valid? Yes? 

But wait: we have E at 4? And in ""TOKEN"", E is at 4? So that matches? 

But we also have to check the third letter? 

In ""TOKEN"": 
Position 1: T -> must be T? 
Position 2: O -> O is present? 
Position 3: K -> unknown? 
Position 4: E -> fixed? 
Position 5: N -> fixed? 

But we know that T must be at 1? And O must be at 2 or 3? So if we put O at 2? Then K at 3? 

But we don't know if K is in the word? 

Similarly, if O is at position 3: T ? O E N? 
Example: ""TWOEN""? Not a word? 
""TUBEN""? Not? 
""THOEN""? Not? 
""TROEN""? R excluded? 
""TREEN""? R excluded? 
""TWEEN"": T, W, E, E, N? Duplicate E? Not allowed? 
""TALEN"": A excluded? 
""TOLEN""? Not common? 

Common words: 
- ""TOKEN"" (if O at 2) 
- ""TOWED"" but that doesn't have E at 4? 
- ""TONED"": T, O, N, E, D? 
  But in ""TONED"": 
  Position 1: T 
  Position 2: O 
  Position 3: N? But we have N at 5? And we cannot have duplicate N? Because Wordle words are unique? 
  So no? 

Another: ""TOYEN"": T, O, Y, E, N? 
Valid? A unit of currency? Not common? 

""TOZEN""? Not? 

So perhaps ""TOKEN"" is the most common? 

But we have another possibility: O at position 3? 
Word: T X O E N? 
What X? 
""T A O E N"": A excluded? 
""T B O E N"": ""TBOEN"" not a word? 
""T C O E N"": C excluded? 
""T D O E N"": ""TDOEN"" not? 
""T E O E N"": duplicate E? 
""T F O E N"": F excluded? 
""T G O E N"": ""TGOEN"" not? 
""T H O E N"": ""THOEN"" not? 
""T I O E N"": I excluded? 
""T J O E N"": not? 
""T K O E N"": ""TKOEN"" not? 
""T L O E N"": ""TLOEN"" not? 
""T M O E N"": ""TMOEN"" not? 
""T N O E N"": duplicate N? 
""T O O E N"": duplicate O? 
""T P O E N"": ""TPOEN"" not? 
""T Q O E N"": not? 
""T R O E N"": R excluded? 
""T S O E N"": S excluded? 
""T U O E N"": ""TUOEN"" not? 
""T V O E N"": not? 
""T W O E N"": ""TWOEN"" not? 
""T X O E N"": not? 
""T Y O E N"": ""TYOEN"" not? 
""T Z O E N"": not? 

So no common word with O at position 3? 

Therefore, the only common word is ""TOKEN"", with O at position 2? 

But in ""TOKEN"", we have:
- T at 1: which we think must be T? 
- O at 2: which is allowed? 
- K at 3: we don't know? 
- E at 4: fixed? 
- N at 5: fixed? 

But we know that O must be in the word? And we are putting it at 2? 

Also, we have to check if K is allowed? We haven't tried K? And it's not excluded? 

So ""TOKEN"" is a valid guess? 

But note: we have to confirm that T is at 1? 

From the constraints: 
- T must be in the word? 
- T cannot be at 2 or 3? 
- The only position left is 1? Because 4 and 5 are taken? 
So T must be at 1? 

Similarly, O must be at 2 or 3? But we found that only position 2 is possible? Because no word with O at 3? 

But wait: what about ""TONNE""? 
""TONNE"": T, O, N, N, E? Duplicate N? Not allowed? 

Or ""TOKEN"" is the only common one? 

Another word: ""TOWEL""? But that ends with L? Not EN? 

So I think ""TOKEN"" is the best guess? 

But let me double-check the feedback? 

In the third guess ""often"", we have E at 4 and N at 5? Correct? 
And O at 1? We got '-' meaning O is present but not at 1? 
So O must be at 2 or 3? 

But in the word ""TOKEN"", O is at 2? So that would be acceptable? 

Also, we have T at 1? Which we think is fixed? 

But what if the word has T at 1? And O at 2? Then the third letter? 

We have to have a letter at 3? 

In ""TOKEN"", it's K? 

But we don't know if K is in the word? 

But if we guess ""TOKEN"", and if it's not the word? Then we get feedback? 

But we have only 3 guesses left? 

Alternatively, we can try to guess the word? 

But note: we have the pattern: T O ? E N? 

And we don't know the third letter? 

But we can try to use a word that has a common letter? 

But we have to avoid the excluded letters? 

So the third letter can be: 
- Not A, C, F, I, R, S? 
- And not O? Because we have O at 2? 
- And not T, E, N? 

So we can use: B, D, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? 

But we want a common word? 

""TOKEN"" is common? 

""TOWED"" we considered? But that doesn't have E at 4? 

""TONED"" has duplicate N? 

""TOYED"": T, O, Y, E, D? 
But then E is at 4? So: 
1:T, 2:O, 3:Y, 4:E, 5:D? 
But we need N at 5? So no? 

So only ""TOKEN"" fits? 

Another: ""TOWEL"" is not? 

Therefore, I think the secret word is ""TOKEN""? 

But let me confirm: 
- T at 1: we think must be T? 
- O at 2: because O must be at 2 or 3? and we have no common word with O at 3? 
- K at 3: new letter? 
- E at 4: fixed? 
- N at 5: fixed? 

But we have to check if K is allowed? 

Also, we haven't tried K? 

So we can guess ""TOKEN""? 

But note: we have to be sure? 

What if the word is ""THOEN""? Not a word? 

Or ""TROEN""? R excluded? 

So I think ""TOKEN"" is the only common word? 

Therefore, we guess ""TOKEN"". 

But wait: what about ""TOKEN"" and the feedback? 

In the first guess, ""crane"": 
- E is present? In ""TOKEN"", E is at 4? 
- N is present? In ""TOKEN"", N is at 5? 

In second guess, ""stein"": 
- T is present? In ""TOKEN"", T at 1? 
- E is present? At 4? 
- N at 5? Correct? 

In third guess, ""often"": 
- O is present? In ""TOKEN"", O at 2? 
- E at 4? Correct? 
- N at 5? Correct? 
- T at 1? But in ""often"", T was at 3? And we got '-' for T? Meaning T is not at 3? But in ""TOKEN"", T is at 1? So that's fine? 

So ""TOKEN"" fits all? 

But we have to see if there is any conflict? 

Also, the letter K? We haven't tried? But it's not excluded? 

So I think it's the word? 

Therefore, we guess ""TOKEN"". 

But note: we have to make a guess? 

So let's do it. 

<guess>token</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses, the secret word has been narrowed down significantly:

- **Position 4 is E** (from ""often"" feedback: E(✓)).
- **Position 5 is N** (from ""stein"" feedback: N(✓) and confirmed in ""often"").
- **T is in the word** but cannot be in position 2 (from ""stein"") or position 3 (from ""often""). Since positions 4 and 5 are fixed, T must be in position 1.
- **O is in the word** but cannot be in position 1 (from ""often""). With position 1 now assigned to T, O must be in position 2 or 3.
- **Excluded letters**: A, C, F, I, R, S (from all feedback).
- **Word structure**: T _ _ E N, with O in position 2 or 3, and the remaining position filled by a new letter not excluded.

After evaluating possible words:
- The only common English word fitting this pattern is **TOKEN**:
  - T (position 1, required for T).
  - O (position 2, valid since O cannot be in position 1).
  - K (position 3, new untested letter).
  - E (position 4, fixed).
  - N (position 5, fixed).

This guess adheres to all constraints and tests the unknown position 3 with K, a common consonant.

<guess>token</guess>",token,"We are given feedback from three guesses:

First guess: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, A are not in the word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Second guess: ""stein"" -> S(x), T(-), E(-), I(x), N(✓)
Meaning:
- S and I are not in the word.
- T is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 3.
- N is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

Third guess: ""often"" -> O(-), F(x), T(-), E(✓), N(✓)
Meaning:
- O is in the word but not in position 1 (since we got '-' for O at position 1).
- F is not in the word.
- T is in the word but not in position 3 (where it was guessed).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- N is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So, summarizing:
- Correct positions: 
  - Position 4: E
  - Position 5: N
- Known present letters (but position not fully known): 
  - T: present, but not in position 2 (from ""stein"") and not in position 3 (from ""often"")
  - O: present, but not in position 1 (from ""often"")
- Known absent letters: A, C, F, I, R, S
- Letters that must be in the word: E, N, T, O (and we have two more letters? But we have positions 1,2,3 to fill? But we have E at 4 and N at 5, so positions 1,2,3 are unknown? But we know T and O are present? So the word has at least T, O, E, N? And one more letter? Because 5 letters? So we have 4 letters: T, O, E, N? And one more? 

But note: we have 5 positions: 
Position 1: unknown
Position 2: unknown
Position 3: unknown
Position 4: E
Position 5: N

We know the word contains T and O? And we have three positions (1,2,3) to fill? But we have two letters (T and O) and one more letter? 

So the word is: [letter1] [letter2] [letter3] E N

We know:
- T is in the word? But not at position 2 or 3? So T must be at position 1? Because positions 4 and 5 are E and N? So the only possibility for T is position 1? 
  - Because T cannot be at 2 or 3? And 4 and 5 are taken? So T must be at position 1? 
- O is in the word? But not at position 1? So O must be at position 2 or 3? 

Also, we have one more letter? Let's call it X? So the word is: T [O or X] [O or X] E N? But we have only one O? So the word must be: T O ? E N or T ? O E N? 

But we have to have one more letter? 

So the word is: T _ _ E N? But we have two positions? 

Wait: positions: 
1: must be T? Because T is present and the only position left? 
2: ? 
3: ? 
4: E 
5: N 

But we have O? Which must be at position 2 or 3? 

So the word is: T [O or ?] [O or ?] E N? 

But we have two positions? And we know O is present? So one of position 2 or 3 is O? The other is an unknown letter? 

But we also have to consider that we have only one O? 

Now, what about the unknown letter? 

We have tried letters: 
- From ""crane"": C, R, A, N, E -> excluded: C, R, A; present: N, E
- From ""stein"": S, T, E, I, N -> excluded: S, I; present: T (and confirmed E and N)
- From ""often"": O, F, T, E, N -> excluded: F; present: O (and confirmed E and N, and T again)

So absent letters: A, C, F, I, R, S

Present letters: T, O, E, N? And one more? 

But we have five letters? So the fifth letter must be one we haven't tried? 

We have positions 2 and 3? One is O? The other is an unknown letter? 

So the word is: T (position1) and then at position2 and 3: one is O and the other is a new letter? 

Now, we need to find a 5-letter word that starts with T, ends with EN, and has O in the middle? 

Pattern: T ? ? E N? 

With one of the ? being O? 

And the other being a letter not in {A, C, F, I, R, S}? 

Also, we know that O is not at position 1? But we have T at 1? So that's fine? 

Now, let's list possible words? 

First, if O is at position 2: T O ? E N? 
What words? 
- ""TOKEN"": T O K E N? 
  - But we have K? 
  - And we haven't tried K? 
  - Also, O at 2? 
  - But note: in ""often"", we had O at position 1? And we got '-' meaning O is present but not at 1? So O at 2 is allowed? 
  - But is ""TOKEN"" valid? Yes? 

But wait: we have E at 4? And in ""TOKEN"", E is at 4? So that matches? 

But we also have to check the third letter? 

In ""TOKEN"": 
Position 1: T -> must be T? 
Position 2: O -> O is present? 
Position 3: K -> unknown? 
Position 4: E -> fixed? 
Position 5: N -> fixed? 

But we know that T must be at 1? And O must be at 2 or 3? So if we put O at 2? Then K at 3? 

But we don't know if K is in the word? 

Similarly, if O is at position 3: T ? O E N? 
Example: ""TWOEN""? Not a word? 
""TUBEN""? Not? 
""THOEN""? Not? 
""TROEN""? R excluded? 
""TREEN""? R excluded? 
""TWEEN"": T, W, E, E, N? Duplicate E? Not allowed? 
""TALEN"": A excluded? 
""TOLEN""? Not common? 

Common words: 
- ""TOKEN"" (if O at 2) 
- ""TOWED"" but that doesn't have E at 4? 
- ""TONED"": T, O, N, E, D? 
  But in ""TONED"": 
  Position 1: T 
  Position 2: O 
  Position 3: N? But we have N at 5? And we cannot have duplicate N? Because Wordle words are unique? 
  So no? 

Another: ""TOYEN"": T, O, Y, E, N? 
Valid? A unit of currency? Not common? 

""TOZEN""? Not? 

So perhaps ""TOKEN"" is the most common? 

But we have another possibility: O at position 3? 
Word: T X O E N? 
What X? 
""T A O E N"": A excluded? 
""T B O E N"": ""TBOEN"" not a word? 
""T C O E N"": C excluded? 
""T D O E N"": ""TDOEN"" not? 
""T E O E N"": duplicate E? 
""T F O E N"": F excluded? 
""T G O E N"": ""TGOEN"" not? 
""T H O E N"": ""THOEN"" not? 
""T I O E N"": I excluded? 
""T J O E N"": not? 
""T K O E N"": ""TKOEN"" not? 
""T L O E N"": ""TLOEN"" not? 
""T M O E N"": ""TMOEN"" not? 
""T N O E N"": duplicate N? 
""T O O E N"": duplicate O? 
""T P O E N"": ""TPOEN"" not? 
""T Q O E N"": not? 
""T R O E N"": R excluded? 
""T S O E N"": S excluded? 
""T U O E N"": ""TUOEN"" not? 
""T V O E N"": not? 
""T W O E N"": ""TWOEN"" not? 
""T X O E N"": not? 
""T Y O E N"": ""TYOEN"" not? 
""T Z O E N"": not? 

So no common word with O at position 3? 

Therefore, the only common word is ""TOKEN"", with O at position 2? 

But in ""TOKEN"", we have:
- T at 1: which we think must be T? 
- O at 2: which is allowed? 
- K at 3: we don't know? 
- E at 4: fixed? 
- N at 5: fixed? 

But we know that O must be in the word? And we are putting it at 2? 

Also, we have to check if K is allowed? We haven't tried K? And it's not excluded? 

So ""TOKEN"" is a valid guess? 

But note: we have to confirm that T is at 1? 

From the constraints: 
- T must be in the word? 
- T cannot be at 2 or 3? 
- The only position left is 1? Because 4 and 5 are taken? 
So T must be at 1? 

Similarly, O must be at 2 or 3? But we found that only position 2 is possible? Because no word with O at 3? 

But wait: what about ""TONNE""? 
""TONNE"": T, O, N, N, E? Duplicate N? Not allowed? 

Or ""TOKEN"" is the only common one? 

Another word: ""TOWEL""? But that ends with L? Not EN? 

So I think ""TOKEN"" is the best guess? 

But let me double-check the feedback? 

In the third guess ""often"", we have E at 4 and N at 5? Correct? 
And O at 1? We got '-' meaning O is present but not at 1? 
So O must be at 2 or 3? 

But in the word ""TOKEN"", O is at 2? So that would be acceptable? 

Also, we have T at 1? Which we think is fixed? 

But what if the word has T at 1? And O at 2? Then the third letter? 

We have to have a letter at 3? 

In ""TOKEN"", it's K? 

But we don't know if K is in the word? 

But if we guess ""TOKEN"", and if it's not the word? Then we get feedback? 

But we have only 3 guesses left? 

Alternatively, we can try to guess the word? 

But note: we have the pattern: T O ? E N? 

And we don't know the third letter? 

But we can try to use a word that has a common letter? 

But we have to avoid the excluded letters? 

So the third letter can be: 
- Not A, C, F, I, R, S? 
- And not O? Because we have O at 2? 
- And not T, E, N? 

So we can use: B, D, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? 

But we want a common word? 

""TOKEN"" is common? 

""TOWED"" we considered? But that doesn't have E at 4? 

""TONED"" has duplicate N? 

""TOYED"": T, O, Y, E, D? 
But then E is at 4? So: 
1:T, 2:O, 3:Y, 4:E, 5:D? 
But we need N at 5? So no? 

So only ""TOKEN"" fits? 

Another: ""TOWEL"" is not? 

Therefore, I think the secret word is ""TOKEN""? 

But let me confirm: 
- T at 1: we think must be T? 
- O at 2: because O must be at 2 or 3? and we have no common word with O at 3? 
- K at 3: new letter? 
- E at 4: fixed? 
- N at 5: fixed? 

But we have to check if K is allowed? 

Also, we haven't tried K? 

So we can guess ""TOKEN""? 

But note: we have to be sure? 

What if the word is ""THOEN""? Not a word? 

Or ""TROEN""? R excluded? 

So I think ""TOKEN"" is the only common word? 

Therefore, we guess ""TOKEN"". 

But wait: what about ""TOKEN"" and the feedback? 

In the first guess, ""crane"": 
- E is present? In ""TOKEN"", E is at 4? 
- N is present? In ""TOKEN"", N is at 5? 

In second guess, ""stein"": 
- T is present? In ""TOKEN"", T at 1? 
- E is present? At 4? 
- N at 5? Correct? 

In third guess, ""often"": 
- O is present? In ""TOKEN"", O at 2? 
- E at 4? Correct? 
- N at 5? Correct? 
- T at 1? But in ""often"", T was at 3? And we got '-' for T? Meaning T is not at 3? But in ""TOKEN"", T is at 1? So that's fine? 

So ""TOKEN"" fits all? 

But we have to see if there is any conflict? 

Also, the letter K? We haven't tried? But it's not excluded? 

So I think it's the word? 

Therefore, we guess ""TOKEN"". 

But note: we have to make a guess? 

So let's do it. 

<guess>token</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses, the secret word has been narrowed down significantly:

- **Position 4 is E** (from ""often"" feedback: E(✓)).
- **Position 5 is N** (from ""stein"" feedback: N(✓) and confirmed in ""often"").
- **T is in the word** but cannot be in position 2 (from ""stein"") or position 3 (from ""often""). Since positions 4 and 5 are fixed, T must be in position 1.
- **O is in the word** but cannot be in position 1 (from ""often""). With position 1 now assigned to T, O must be in position 2 or 3.
- **Excluded letters**: A, C, F, I, R, S (from all feedback).
- **Word structure**: T _ _ E N, with O in position 2 or 3, and the remaining position filled by a new letter not excluded.

After evaluating possible words:
- The only common English word fitting this pattern is **TOKEN**:
  - T (position 1, required for T).
  - O (position 2, valid since O cannot be in position 1).
  - K (position 3, new untested letter).
  - E (position 4, fixed).
  - N (position 5, fixed).

This guess adheres to all constraints and tests the unknown position 3 with K, a common consonant.",Guess 4: token -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) O(✓) K(✓) E(✓) N(✓),SUCCESS
