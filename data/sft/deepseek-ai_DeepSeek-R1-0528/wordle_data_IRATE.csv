Hmm, the user wants me to make my first guess in a Wordle game. Since this is the first attempt, I have no prior feedback to work with - I need to choose a strong starting word strategically.

I recall that in Wordle and similar word games, optimal starters typically include common letters and balance vowels and consonants. Letters like S, E, A, R, T appear frequently in English words. My goal is to maximize information gain about the secret word, which means covering multiple common letters and diverse positions.

Considering words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ROATE"" - these cover frequent vowels and consonants. But ""ARISE"" sticks out to me: it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), hitting four out of five most frequent English letters. The vowel-consonant spread is decent too (vowel-consonant-vowel-consonant-vowel).

I should verify it's valid - ""ARISE"" is definitely a common English word meaning to emerge or originate. The positions will efficiently test letter frequency: A at start, R second, I third, S fourth, E end - diverse placements indeed.

This initial guess sacrifices perfect positional frequency for broad coverage - a tradeoff worth making early on. For simplicity and effectiveness, ""ARISE"" seems superior to alternatives like ""ADIEU"" which wastes letters like D/U early on.

Confirmation: this approach follows Wordle conventions where starters like SALET/CRANE dominate, and ""ARISE"" fits that profile. I'll go with it - setting up well for deductions in subsequent guesses.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""arise"":
 A: - (present but wrong position)
 R: ✓ (correct position)
 I: - (present but wrong position)
 S: x (not present)
 E: ✓ (correct position)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word has the letters A, R, I, E (since A, R, I, E are present, and S is absent).
 - R is in the second position (index 1) and E is in the fifth position (index 4).
 - A is in the word but not in the first position (since we had A in first and it was marked as wrong position? Actually, note: the feedback for A is '-' meaning it is in the word but not in the first position. Similarly, I is in the word but not in the third position.

 Let's break down the positions:
 Position 0: A (we now know A is not at position 0, but is in the word)
 Position 1: R (correct, so the secret word has R at position 1)
 Position 2: I (we now know I is in the word but not at position 2)
 Position 3: S (absent, so no S in the word)
 Position 4: E (correct, so the secret word has E at position 4)

 Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ R _ _ E

 And it contains the letters: A, R, I, E (and one more letter we don't know yet, but not S).

 We also know that A and I must be placed in positions 0, 2, or 3 (but not at the positions they were in the first guess). However, note that position 0 is available for A? But we know A is not at position 0? Actually, wait: the feedback for A is '-' meaning it is in the word but not at position 0. So A must be in one of positions 2 or 3 (since position 1 is R and position 4 is E). Similarly, I is not at position 2, so I must be in position 0 or 3.

 But note: the word has 5 letters and we have two letters to place: A and I, and one more unknown letter.

 The constraints:
 - Position 0: cannot be A (because we had A there and it was marked as wrong position) and cannot be R (already at position 1) or E (at position 4). Also, we know I might be here? Or the unknown letter.
 - Position 2: cannot be I (because we had I there and it was marked as wrong position). Also, it cannot be R (position 1) or E (position 4). But A could be here? Or the unknown letter.
 - Position 3: cannot be S (absent) and cannot be R or E. So it can be A, I, or the unknown letter.

 Now, we have two letters that must be placed: A and I. They must go in positions 0, 2, 3? But note: we have three positions (0,2,3) and two letters (A and I) and one more letter (unknown) to place.

 However, we also know that the word has exactly 5 letters and we have accounted for R and E. So the remaining three positions (0,2,3) must be filled by A, I, and one other letter (which we don't know).

 Let's consider the possibilities for A and I:

 For A: it cannot be at position 0 (as per feedback) and cannot be at position 1 (R) or 4 (E). So it must be at position 2 or 3.

 For I: it cannot be at position 2 (as per feedback) and cannot be at position 1 (R) or 4 (E). So it must be at position 0 or 3.

 But note: if A is at position 2, then I can be at position 0 or 3. If A is at position 3, then I can be at position 0 (but not 3 because then two letters at same position? and also we have one more letter to place). Actually, we have three positions to fill: 0,2,3. We have three letters: A, I, and one unknown (let's call it X).

 So the possibilities:

 Option 1:
   Position 0: I
   Position 2: A
   Position 3: X

 Option 2:
   Position 0: I
   Position 2: X
   Position 3: A

 Option 3:
   Position 0: X
   Position 2: A
   Position 3: I

 Option 4:
   Position 0: X
   Position 2: I   -> but wait, I cannot be at position 2 (feedback from first guess) -> so invalid.

 Option 5:
   Position 0: X
   Position 2: ?   -> but if we put I at position 3, then A must go at position 2? But then we have:
   Position 0: X
   Position 2: A
   Position 3: I   -> this is Option 3.

 Option 6:
   Position 0: I
   Position 2: A
   Position 3: X   -> Option 1.

 Option 7:
   Position 0: I
   Position 2: X
   Position 3: A   -> Option 2.

 Option 8: 
   Position 0: A -> invalid because A cannot be at position 0.

 So we have three valid patterns:

 Pattern 1: I R A X E
 Pattern 2: I R X A E
 Pattern 3: X R A I E

 Now, we need to choose a word that fits one of these patterns and also does not contain S (we know S is absent). Also, we must use only letters that are in the word (we know A, R, I, E are present, and one more letter X which is not S and not any of the absent letters we might have encountered? But we only have one guess so far).

 We don't know X, so we can try to pick a word that tests common letters and fits one of these patterns.

 However, note: we have two constraints on the unknown letter X: it must be a letter that is not S and not already known to be absent? But we don't have any other absent information except S.

 We can also consider that the word must be a valid English word.

 Let's think of common words that fit these patterns.

 Pattern 1: I R A X E
   We need a word: I R A ? E
   What could be the fourth letter? Examples: 
     IRAZE? (not a word)
     IRATE -> valid word. But note: we have E at the end? IRATE is I R A T E -> so T is the unknown.

 Pattern 2: I R X A E
   We need: I R ? A E
   Examples: 
     IRADE? (not a word)
     IRATE? -> no, because then A is at position 3? But in IRATE: I R A T E -> A is at position 2, not 3. So not pattern 2.
     We need the A at position 3. So: 
        Position 0: I, position 1: R, position 2: ?, position 3: A, position 4: E.
        Example: IRMAE? (not a word), IRGAE? (not common), IROAE? (not common). 
        Actually, we can try: I R O A E -> IROAE? not a word. 
        Another: I R B A E -> IRBAE? not a word.

 Pattern 3: X R A I E
   We need: ? R A I E
   Examples: 
     GRAIE? (not a word)
     CRAIE? (not a word)
     BRAIE? (not a word)
     TRAIE? (not a word)
     DRAIE? (not a word)
     FRAIE? (not a word) 
     Actually, we have ""BRAIE"" which is not a word. But note: we have ""BRAVE"" but that has V at position 3, not I. 
     How about ""GRAZE""? But we know S is absent? Actually, Z is allowed? But note: we don't have Z in the feedback. However, we are looking for a word with I at position 3? 
     Let me check: 
        Position 0: ? , 1: R, 2: A, 3: I, 4: E -> so the word ends with ""RAIE"". 
        Common words: 
          PRAISE? but that's 6 letters.
          There are not many 5-letter words ending in ""RAIE"". 

     Actually, I can't think of a common word for pattern 3.

 So pattern 1 seems the most promising: IRATE.

 But let's check if IRATE fits the feedback we have? 
   Our first guess was ""arise"": 
        a r i s e -> feedback: A(-), R(✓), I(-), S(x), E(✓)

   Now, if the secret word is ""irate"":
        I R A T E

   How would the feedback for ""arise"" have been?
        A: in ""irate"" but at position 2? In ""arise"" it was at position 0 -> so should be marked as present but wrong position -> matches (-).
        R: at position 1 in both -> matches (✓).
        I: in ""irate"" at position 0? In ""arise"" it was at position 2 -> so should be marked as present but wrong position -> matches (-).
        S: not in ""irate"" -> matches (x).
        E: at position 4 -> matches (✓).

   So IRATE is consistent.

 But note: we are not sure that the word is IRATE. There might be other possibilities.

 However, we have two other patterns that we haven't found common words for. So IRATE is a candidate.

 But we must also consider that there might be other words in pattern 1 with a different X? For example, IRAZE? (not a word). Or IRADE? (not a word). So IRATE is the only common word for pattern 1.

 What about pattern 2? We didn't find a common word. Pattern 3 we didn't find a common word.

 But wait, pattern 3: X R A I E -> what about ""CRAIG""? But that ends with G, not E. Or ""FRAIL""? But that ends with L, not E. So no.

 Alternatively, we might have missed a word in pattern 2? Let me try again: 
   Pattern 2: I R ? A E
   We need a word: I R ? A E -> the third letter (position 2) is unknown, then A at position 3 and E at position 4.

   Examples: 
     IRONE? -> but that would be I R O N E -> but then the A is missing? We need A at position 3? But in IRONE, position 3 is N, not A.
     We need: I R (letter) A E -> so the word is I R _ A E.

   Let me think: 
     IRATE is I R A T E -> that doesn't fit because A is at position 2, not 3.
     I R B A E -> not a word.
     I R C A E -> not a word.
     I R D A E -> not a word.
     I R E A E -> duplicate E? and not a word.
     I R F A E -> not a word.
     I R G A E -> not a word.
     I R H A E -> not a word.
     I R I A E -> duplicate I? and not a word.
     I R K A E -> not a word.
     I R L A E -> not a word.
     I R M A E -> IRMAE? not a word.
     I R N A E -> not a word.
     I R O A E -> IROAE? not a word.
     I R P A E -> not a word.
     I R Q A E -> not a word.
     I R R A E -> duplicate R? and not a word.
     I R S A E -> but S is absent? we know S is not in the word -> so invalid.
     I R T A E -> IRTAE? not a word.
     I R U A E -> not a word.
     I R V A E -> not a word.
     I R W A E -> not a word.
     I R X A E -> not a word.
     I R Y A E -> not a word.
     I R Z A E -> not a word.

 So pattern 2 doesn't yield a common word.

 Therefore, the only common word we have so far is IRATE (pattern 1). 

 But note: there might be other words in pattern 1 with a different letter than T? For example, IRA?E: 
   We have IRA_E -> the fourth letter must be a consonant? 
   IRAVE? -> not a word (but BRAVE is, but that starts with B).
   IRAKE? -> not a word.
   IRAFE? -> not a word.
   So T is the only common one.

 However, we must also consider that the unknown letter might be one that we haven't thought of? But in pattern 1, we have the form: I R A ? E.

 We can also consider pattern 3 again: 
   ? R A I E -> we need a word: _ R A I E. 
   Let me search: 
     BRAIE? -> not a word.
     CRAIE? -> not a word.
     DRAIE? -> not a word.
     FRAIE? -> not a word.
     GRAIE? -> not a word.
     TRAIE? -> not a word.
     WRAIE? -> not a word.

   Actually, there is ""URAei"" but that's not 5 letters? 

   So it seems pattern 3 doesn't have a common word.

 Therefore, the best candidate is ""irate"". But note: we are not forced to guess the candidate. We can also choose a word that helps us distinguish between the patterns.

 However, we have three patterns and we only found one common word (for pattern 1). The other patterns don't have common words? So maybe the secret word is ""irate"".

 But wait, what if the secret word is in pattern 3 and we just don't know the word? We should consider that. Alternatively, we can choose a guess that tests multiple possibilities.

 Let's think of a word that fits pattern 1, 2, or 3? But we don't have a word for pattern 2 and 3. 

 Alternatively, we can design a guess that helps us determine the positions of A and I and the unknown letter.

 We know:
   The word has R at position 1 and E at position 4.
   The word has A and I, and one more letter (X) that is not S.

 We want to test:
   Is A at position 2? (then pattern 1 or 3) 
   Is I at position 0? (then pattern 1 or 2) 
   Or is I at position 3? (then pattern 3) 
   Or is A at position 3? (then pattern 2)

 We can choose a word that has:
   - I at position 0? and A at position 2? -> that would be pattern 1: IRA?E (but we don't know the fourth letter, so we can't form a word without knowing X? but we can choose a word that has I at 0 and A at 2 and then use a common letter for the fourth?).

 But note: we are allowed to use any valid word, even if it includes letters we haven't tried. We just cannot use S.

 Alternatively, we can try to cover more common letters. 

 Let me propose a word that has:
   I at position 0 and A at position 3? -> that would be pattern 2: I R ? A E -> but we don't know the letter at position 2.

 But we can try a word that has I at position 0 and A at position 3? and then a common letter at position 2? For example, ""IRATE"" has A at position 2, not 3. 

 How about ""IRKAE""? Not a word.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't necessarily use only the known letters? Because we are allowed to test new letters.

 We know the word has A, I, R, E and one more letter (X). We don't know X. We can try to include common consonants to test.

 Let me think of a word that fits the known constraints and also tests common letters.

 Constraints: 
   Position 1 must be R, position 4 must be E.
   We cannot use S.

 We are free to choose positions 0, 2, 3.

 But we know the word must contain A and I. So we have to place A and I in the available positions (0,2,3) and one more letter (which we are going to test) in the remaining position.

 We can design a guess that:
   - Places I at position 0 (to test if it is there) and A at position 3 (to test if it is there) and then a common letter (say T) at position 2? -> word: I R T A E -> ""IRTAE"" -> not a valid word.

 How about ""IREAE""? -> not valid.

 Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has the letter T (a common letter) and also places A and I in positions we haven't tried? 

 But note: we have already tried A at 0 and I at 2. Now we want to try A at 3 and I at 0? 

 We can try: ""IXNAE""? not a word.

 This is difficult.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't force the pattern but tests the presence of common letters and also fits the known constraints? 

 We know the word has R at 1 and E at 4. We know it has A and I. We don't know the other letter.

 We can try a word that has:
   Position 0: a common letter we haven't tried (like T, L, N, etc.) 
   Position 2: A (to test if A is at position 2) 
   Position 3: I (to test if I is at position 3) 

 But note: we cannot put I at position 3 and A at position 2? because then we have the pattern: T R A I E -> which is pattern 3? and we don't know if that's valid.

 Example: ""TRAIE"" -> not a word.

 How about ""TRAIN""? but that doesn't end with E.

 We need to end with E. So the word must be: _ R _ _ E.

 We want to test A at position 2 and I at position 3: so the word would be: _ R A I E. 

 We need a valid word of the form: ? R A I E. We couldn't find one. So that pattern might not exist.

 Therefore, the only common word we have is ""IRATE"". 

 So I will guess ""irate"". If it's not the secret word, we'll get feedback that will help us.

 Alternatively, we can guess a word that uses common letters to test the unknown positions. But since we have a candidate that fits, let's go with it.

 Guess: ""irate""

 But note: we are allowed to guess the same word? We haven't guessed it. So it's valid.

 However, if the secret word is not ""irate"", we will get feedback that tells us which letters are correct and which are not, and we can then deduce the pattern.

 So I choose ""irate"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""arise"":
- A is present but not in position 0 (marked -)
- R is correct and in position 1 (marked ✓)
- I is present but not in position 2 (marked -)
- S is absent (marked x)
- E is correct and in position 4 (marked ✓)

The secret word has the following constraints:
- Must contain A, R, I, E (S is excluded)
- R is fixed at position 1, E at position 4
- A cannot be in position 0 or 1, I cannot be in position 1 or 2
- Possible patterns: `I R A ? E`, `I R ? A E`, or `? R A I E`

After evaluating common English words, ""irate"" fits the pattern `I R A ? E` (specifically `I R A T E`). This guess tests:
- I at position 0 (could be correct if pattern 1 is valid)
- A at position 2 (could be correct if pattern 1 or 3 is valid)
- T as a new common letter
- Maintains R at position 1 and E at position 4

This guess will help confirm or refute the patterns while efficiently testing new letters.

<guess>irate</guess>",irate,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""arise"":
 A: - (present but wrong position)
 R: ✓ (correct position)
 I: - (present but wrong position)
 S: x (not present)
 E: ✓ (correct position)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word has the letters A, R, I, E (since A, R, I, E are present, and S is absent).
 - R is in the second position (index 1) and E is in the fifth position (index 4).
 - A is in the word but not in the first position (since we had A in first and it was marked as wrong position? Actually, note: the feedback for A is '-' meaning it is in the word but not in the first position. Similarly, I is in the word but not in the third position.

 Let's break down the positions:
 Position 0: A (we now know A is not at position 0, but is in the word)
 Position 1: R (correct, so the secret word has R at position 1)
 Position 2: I (we now know I is in the word but not at position 2)
 Position 3: S (absent, so no S in the word)
 Position 4: E (correct, so the secret word has E at position 4)

 Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ R _ _ E

 And it contains the letters: A, R, I, E (and one more letter we don't know yet, but not S).

 We also know that A and I must be placed in positions 0, 2, or 3 (but not at the positions they were in the first guess). However, note that position 0 is available for A? But we know A is not at position 0? Actually, wait: the feedback for A is '-' meaning it is in the word but not at position 0. So A must be in one of positions 2 or 3 (since position 1 is R and position 4 is E). Similarly, I is not at position 2, so I must be in position 0 or 3.

 But note: the word has 5 letters and we have two letters to place: A and I, and one more unknown letter.

 The constraints:
 - Position 0: cannot be A (because we had A there and it was marked as wrong position) and cannot be R (already at position 1) or E (at position 4). Also, we know I might be here? Or the unknown letter.
 - Position 2: cannot be I (because we had I there and it was marked as wrong position). Also, it cannot be R (position 1) or E (position 4). But A could be here? Or the unknown letter.
 - Position 3: cannot be S (absent) and cannot be R or E. So it can be A, I, or the unknown letter.

 Now, we have two letters that must be placed: A and I. They must go in positions 0, 2, 3? But note: we have three positions (0,2,3) and two letters (A and I) and one more letter (unknown) to place.

 However, we also know that the word has exactly 5 letters and we have accounted for R and E. So the remaining three positions (0,2,3) must be filled by A, I, and one other letter (which we don't know).

 Let's consider the possibilities for A and I:

 For A: it cannot be at position 0 (as per feedback) and cannot be at position 1 (R) or 4 (E). So it must be at position 2 or 3.

 For I: it cannot be at position 2 (as per feedback) and cannot be at position 1 (R) or 4 (E). So it must be at position 0 or 3.

 But note: if A is at position 2, then I can be at position 0 or 3. If A is at position 3, then I can be at position 0 (but not 3 because then two letters at same position? and also we have one more letter to place). Actually, we have three positions to fill: 0,2,3. We have three letters: A, I, and one unknown (let's call it X).

 So the possibilities:

 Option 1:
   Position 0: I
   Position 2: A
   Position 3: X

 Option 2:
   Position 0: I
   Position 2: X
   Position 3: A

 Option 3:
   Position 0: X
   Position 2: A
   Position 3: I

 Option 4:
   Position 0: X
   Position 2: I   -> but wait, I cannot be at position 2 (feedback from first guess) -> so invalid.

 Option 5:
   Position 0: X
   Position 2: ?   -> but if we put I at position 3, then A must go at position 2? But then we have:
   Position 0: X
   Position 2: A
   Position 3: I   -> this is Option 3.

 Option 6:
   Position 0: I
   Position 2: A
   Position 3: X   -> Option 1.

 Option 7:
   Position 0: I
   Position 2: X
   Position 3: A   -> Option 2.

 Option 8: 
   Position 0: A -> invalid because A cannot be at position 0.

 So we have three valid patterns:

 Pattern 1: I R A X E
 Pattern 2: I R X A E
 Pattern 3: X R A I E

 Now, we need to choose a word that fits one of these patterns and also does not contain S (we know S is absent). Also, we must use only letters that are in the word (we know A, R, I, E are present, and one more letter X which is not S and not any of the absent letters we might have encountered? But we only have one guess so far).

 We don't know X, so we can try to pick a word that tests common letters and fits one of these patterns.

 However, note: we have two constraints on the unknown letter X: it must be a letter that is not S and not already known to be absent? But we don't have any other absent information except S.

 We can also consider that the word must be a valid English word.

 Let's think of common words that fit these patterns.

 Pattern 1: I R A X E
   We need a word: I R A ? E
   What could be the fourth letter? Examples: 
     IRAZE? (not a word)
     IRATE -> valid word. But note: we have E at the end? IRATE is I R A T E -> so T is the unknown.

 Pattern 2: I R X A E
   We need: I R ? A E
   Examples: 
     IRADE? (not a word)
     IRATE? -> no, because then A is at position 3? But in IRATE: I R A T E -> A is at position 2, not 3. So not pattern 2.
     We need the A at position 3. So: 
        Position 0: I, position 1: R, position 2: ?, position 3: A, position 4: E.
        Example: IRMAE? (not a word), IRGAE? (not common), IROAE? (not common). 
        Actually, we can try: I R O A E -> IROAE? not a word. 
        Another: I R B A E -> IRBAE? not a word.

 Pattern 3: X R A I E
   We need: ? R A I E
   Examples: 
     GRAIE? (not a word)
     CRAIE? (not a word)
     BRAIE? (not a word)
     TRAIE? (not a word)
     DRAIE? (not a word)
     FRAIE? (not a word) 
     Actually, we have ""BRAIE"" which is not a word. But note: we have ""BRAVE"" but that has V at position 3, not I. 
     How about ""GRAZE""? But we know S is absent? Actually, Z is allowed? But note: we don't have Z in the feedback. However, we are looking for a word with I at position 3? 
     Let me check: 
        Position 0: ? , 1: R, 2: A, 3: I, 4: E -> so the word ends with ""RAIE"". 
        Common words: 
          PRAISE? but that's 6 letters.
          There are not many 5-letter words ending in ""RAIE"". 

     Actually, I can't think of a common word for pattern 3.

 So pattern 1 seems the most promising: IRATE.

 But let's check if IRATE fits the feedback we have? 
   Our first guess was ""arise"": 
        a r i s e -> feedback: A(-), R(✓), I(-), S(x), E(✓)

   Now, if the secret word is ""irate"":
        I R A T E

   How would the feedback for ""arise"" have been?
        A: in ""irate"" but at position 2? In ""arise"" it was at position 0 -> so should be marked as present but wrong position -> matches (-).
        R: at position 1 in both -> matches (✓).
        I: in ""irate"" at position 0? In ""arise"" it was at position 2 -> so should be marked as present but wrong position -> matches (-).
        S: not in ""irate"" -> matches (x).
        E: at position 4 -> matches (✓).

   So IRATE is consistent.

 But note: we are not sure that the word is IRATE. There might be other possibilities.

 However, we have two other patterns that we haven't found common words for. So IRATE is a candidate.

 But we must also consider that there might be other words in pattern 1 with a different X? For example, IRAZE? (not a word). Or IRADE? (not a word). So IRATE is the only common word for pattern 1.

 What about pattern 2? We didn't find a common word. Pattern 3 we didn't find a common word.

 But wait, pattern 3: X R A I E -> what about ""CRAIG""? But that ends with G, not E. Or ""FRAIL""? But that ends with L, not E. So no.

 Alternatively, we might have missed a word in pattern 2? Let me try again: 
   Pattern 2: I R ? A E
   We need a word: I R ? A E -> the third letter (position 2) is unknown, then A at position 3 and E at position 4.

   Examples: 
     IRONE? -> but that would be I R O N E -> but then the A is missing? We need A at position 3? But in IRONE, position 3 is N, not A.
     We need: I R (letter) A E -> so the word is I R _ A E.

   Let me think: 
     IRATE is I R A T E -> that doesn't fit because A is at position 2, not 3.
     I R B A E -> not a word.
     I R C A E -> not a word.
     I R D A E -> not a word.
     I R E A E -> duplicate E? and not a word.
     I R F A E -> not a word.
     I R G A E -> not a word.
     I R H A E -> not a word.
     I R I A E -> duplicate I? and not a word.
     I R K A E -> not a word.
     I R L A E -> not a word.
     I R M A E -> IRMAE? not a word.
     I R N A E -> not a word.
     I R O A E -> IROAE? not a word.
     I R P A E -> not a word.
     I R Q A E -> not a word.
     I R R A E -> duplicate R? and not a word.
     I R S A E -> but S is absent? we know S is not in the word -> so invalid.
     I R T A E -> IRTAE? not a word.
     I R U A E -> not a word.
     I R V A E -> not a word.
     I R W A E -> not a word.
     I R X A E -> not a word.
     I R Y A E -> not a word.
     I R Z A E -> not a word.

 So pattern 2 doesn't yield a common word.

 Therefore, the only common word we have so far is IRATE (pattern 1). 

 But note: there might be other words in pattern 1 with a different letter than T? For example, IRA?E: 
   We have IRA_E -> the fourth letter must be a consonant? 
   IRAVE? -> not a word (but BRAVE is, but that starts with B).
   IRAKE? -> not a word.
   IRAFE? -> not a word.
   So T is the only common one.

 However, we must also consider that the unknown letter might be one that we haven't thought of? But in pattern 1, we have the form: I R A ? E.

 We can also consider pattern 3 again: 
   ? R A I E -> we need a word: _ R A I E. 
   Let me search: 
     BRAIE? -> not a word.
     CRAIE? -> not a word.
     DRAIE? -> not a word.
     FRAIE? -> not a word.
     GRAIE? -> not a word.
     TRAIE? -> not a word.
     WRAIE? -> not a word.

   Actually, there is ""URAei"" but that's not 5 letters? 

   So it seems pattern 3 doesn't have a common word.

 Therefore, the best candidate is ""irate"". But note: we are not forced to guess the candidate. We can also choose a word that helps us distinguish between the patterns.

 However, we have three patterns and we only found one common word (for pattern 1). The other patterns don't have common words? So maybe the secret word is ""irate"".

 But wait, what if the secret word is in pattern 3 and we just don't know the word? We should consider that. Alternatively, we can choose a guess that tests multiple possibilities.

 Let's think of a word that fits pattern 1, 2, or 3? But we don't have a word for pattern 2 and 3. 

 Alternatively, we can design a guess that helps us determine the positions of A and I and the unknown letter.

 We know:
   The word has R at position 1 and E at position 4.
   The word has A and I, and one more letter (X) that is not S.

 We want to test:
   Is A at position 2? (then pattern 1 or 3) 
   Is I at position 0? (then pattern 1 or 2) 
   Or is I at position 3? (then pattern 3) 
   Or is A at position 3? (then pattern 2)

 We can choose a word that has:
   - I at position 0? and A at position 2? -> that would be pattern 1: IRA?E (but we don't know the fourth letter, so we can't form a word without knowing X? but we can choose a word that has I at 0 and A at 2 and then use a common letter for the fourth?).

 But note: we are allowed to use any valid word, even if it includes letters we haven't tried. We just cannot use S.

 Alternatively, we can try to cover more common letters. 

 Let me propose a word that has:
   I at position 0 and A at position 3? -> that would be pattern 2: I R ? A E -> but we don't know the letter at position 2.

 But we can try a word that has I at position 0 and A at position 3? and then a common letter at position 2? For example, ""IRATE"" has A at position 2, not 3. 

 How about ""IRKAE""? Not a word.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't necessarily use only the known letters? Because we are allowed to test new letters.

 We know the word has A, I, R, E and one more letter (X). We don't know X. We can try to include common consonants to test.

 Let me think of a word that fits the known constraints and also tests common letters.

 Constraints: 
   Position 1 must be R, position 4 must be E.
   We cannot use S.

 We are free to choose positions 0, 2, 3.

 But we know the word must contain A and I. So we have to place A and I in the available positions (0,2,3) and one more letter (which we are going to test) in the remaining position.

 We can design a guess that:
   - Places I at position 0 (to test if it is there) and A at position 3 (to test if it is there) and then a common letter (say T) at position 2? -> word: I R T A E -> ""IRTAE"" -> not a valid word.

 How about ""IREAE""? -> not valid.

 Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has the letter T (a common letter) and also places A and I in positions we haven't tried? 

 But note: we have already tried A at 0 and I at 2. Now we want to try A at 3 and I at 0? 

 We can try: ""IXNAE""? not a word.

 This is difficult.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't force the pattern but tests the presence of common letters and also fits the known constraints? 

 We know the word has R at 1 and E at 4. We know it has A and I. We don't know the other letter.

 We can try a word that has:
   Position 0: a common letter we haven't tried (like T, L, N, etc.) 
   Position 2: A (to test if A is at position 2) 
   Position 3: I (to test if I is at position 3) 

 But note: we cannot put I at position 3 and A at position 2? because then we have the pattern: T R A I E -> which is pattern 3? and we don't know if that's valid.

 Example: ""TRAIE"" -> not a word.

 How about ""TRAIN""? but that doesn't end with E.

 We need to end with E. So the word must be: _ R _ _ E.

 We want to test A at position 2 and I at position 3: so the word would be: _ R A I E. 

 We need a valid word of the form: ? R A I E. We couldn't find one. So that pattern might not exist.

 Therefore, the only common word we have is ""IRATE"". 

 So I will guess ""irate"". If it's not the secret word, we'll get feedback that will help us.

 Alternatively, we can guess a word that uses common letters to test the unknown positions. But since we have a candidate that fits, let's go with it.

 Guess: ""irate""

 But note: we are allowed to guess the same word? We haven't guessed it. So it's valid.

 However, if the secret word is not ""irate"", we will get feedback that tells us which letters are correct and which are not, and we can then deduce the pattern.

 So I choose ""irate"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""arise"":
- A is present but not in position 0 (marked -)
- R is correct and in position 1 (marked ✓)
- I is present but not in position 2 (marked -)
- S is absent (marked x)
- E is correct and in position 4 (marked ✓)

The secret word has the following constraints:
- Must contain A, R, I, E (S is excluded)
- R is fixed at position 1, E at position 4
- A cannot be in position 0 or 1, I cannot be in position 1 or 2
- Possible patterns: `I R A ? E`, `I R ? A E`, or `? R A I E`

After evaluating common English words, ""irate"" fits the pattern `I R A ? E` (specifically `I R A T E`). This guess tests:
- I at position 0 (could be correct if pattern 1 is valid)
- A at position 2 (could be correct if pattern 1 or 3 is valid)
- T as a new common letter
- Maintains R at position 1 and E at position 4

This guess will help confirm or refute the patterns while efficiently testing new letters.",Guess 2: irate -> FEEDBACK: I(✓) R(✓) A(✓) T(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
