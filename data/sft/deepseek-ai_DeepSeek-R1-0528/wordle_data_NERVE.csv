We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback. For the first guess, we want to choose a word that commonly contains vowels and common consonants to maximize the information we get from the feedback.
Common starting words in games like Wordle are words with multiple vowels and common letters. Examples include ""CRATE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ADIEU"", ""STARE"", etc.
Since we don't know the secret word, we should pick a word that uses five distinct letters to cover more ground.

I think ""CRATE"" is a good starting word because:
- It contains two common vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (C, R, T).
- All letters are distinct.

So, for the first guess, I will go with ""CRATE"".

We are now on the second guess. The previous feedback for ""crate"" was:
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: t (x) (not in the word) -> Correction: the feedback shows A(x) meaning A is not present
- T: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the last letter and is correct)

So, from feedback:
- The secret word has an R, but not as the second letter (since in ""crate"", R was in position 2 and it's marked as wrong position).
- The secret word has an E in the fifth position (since E was correct there).
- Letters C, A, T are not in the word at all.

Therefore, we know:
- The word ends with E.
- R is present somewhere but not in the second position. Possible positions for R: 1, 3, or 4 (since 2 is wrong and 5 is E).
- We must avoid using C, A, T in the new guess.

Now, we need to form a five-letter word that ends with E and includes an R (but not in position 2). Also, we want to test other common vowels and consonants to get more information.

Since E is fixed at the end, let's brainstorm words ending with E that have R not in the second position.

Common consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, but excluding C, A, T.

Vowels we haven't checked: O, I, U (since A is out). We also know E is at the end, but there might be other E's? The feedback for E was only for position 5. We don't know if there are other E's, but since position 5 is E, and we have only one correct, we should consider that E might appear twice? But typically, we start without assuming duplicate letters unless feedback suggests.

In the first guess, we had E at the end and it was correct. But note, we don't know if E is present elsewhere because we only had one E. But since A is excluded, we might want to try another vowel.

Possible vowels to test: O, I, U.

We also note that R is present, so we can place R at the beginning or in the middle.

Let me try to think of words with R in position 1, 3, or 4 and E at the end.

Examples:
- If R is at position 1: words like R__ _ E. e.g., RUPEE, but that has two E's? 
- But we must avoid A, C, T.

Better to choose a word that uses new letters to maximize information.

Idea: ""PROSE"" - but P, R, O, S, E. Let's check:
- P is not excluded
- R is included, and we can put R in position 1? In ""prose"", R is at position 2? Oh, no: P (1), R (2), O (3), S (4), E (5). But in this case, R is in the second position. We know from feedback that R is not in position 2? Wait, the feedback said R(-) meaning R is in the word but not in the second position? Correct! So if I put R in position 2 again, it will be wrong.

Therefore, we cannot have R in position 2 for the new guess. So ""prose"" has R in position 2: not allowed.

We need a word where R is not in position 2 and E is at the end.

Alternative: place R in position 1: e.g., ""ROUSE"" - R O U S E. 
- Positions: R(1), O(2), U(3), S(4), E(5)
- But O is in position 2, which we haven't tested. Letter S is also new.

This might be a good choice? But let's confirm: we aren't using C, A, T. R is at position 1, which is good because we know R isn't at position 2, so trying at position 1 is new.

Another option: ""RINSE"" - R I N S E. R at position 1, I at position 2, etc.

We could try to include O to check for that vowel.

But note, we have not checked any O or I yet. So both ""ROUSE"" and ""RINSE"" are candidates.

I think ""ROUSE"" might be better because we include O and U which are vowels we haven't checked.

So, guess: ROUSE.

Reasoning:
- Ends with E: good.
- Has R at position 1 (so not at position 2, which we know is wrong).
- Uses new letters: O, U, S (which haven't been tried).
- S wasn't in the first guess? We had C,R,A,T,E so S is new.

But wait, in the feedback, we know that R is in the word, but we don't know where. By placing it at position 1, we can test if R is at position 1 or not. If it's correct, great; if it's present but wrong position, then we know it must be at position 3 or 4.

Similarly, we are testing O, U, S.

So, ""ROUSE"" seems a good choice.

There's also ""RUBLE"" but B and L are also new? But E is at the end. However, ""ROUSE"" uses common letters.

Another word: ""PRIDE"" but P R I D E: R is at position 2? No, position 2 is R, which is not allowed because we know R is not in position 2 in the secret word? Wait, feedback said R(-) for position 2 meaning that R is in the word but not at position 2. So in a new guess, if we put R at position 2, it will again be marked as '-' since it's present but wrong position? But if R is actually at position 2, it would be marked as correct? But in reality, we know it's not at position 2, so placing at position 2 is wasteful because it will only get '-'.

Therefore, to save positions and get better feedback, it's best to avoid putting R at position 2 again.

So ""PRIDE"" places R in position 2, which is not good.

Avoid R in position 2.

Therefore, ""ROUSE"" is a solid choice.

Let me confirm spelling: ROUSE - it's a valid word meaning to stir or awaken.

So, I will guess ""ROUSE"".

But in the feedback, E was correct, so the word ends with E. We are respecting that.

Also, we are avoiding A, C, T.

Therefore, guess: ROUSE.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crate"":
- C, A, T are **not** in the secret word (indicated by ""x"").
- R is in the secret word but **not** in the second position (indicated by ""-"").
- E is in the secret word and in the **correct** fifth position (indicated by ""✓"").

Therefore:
- The secret word **ends with E**.
- R **must appear** in position 1, 3, or 4 (since position 2 is incorrect).
- New guess should **avoid C, A, T** and include R in an untried position (not position 2).
- Prioritize testing common vowels/consonants not yet ruled out: O, U, S, I, etc.

With this in mind, ""ROUSE"" is a strategic guess:
- Ends with E (respects the correct position).
- Places R in position 1 (tests if R is in position 1).
- Introduces new vowels O and U, and consonant S.
- Avoids C, A, T.

We could try to include O to check for that vowel.

But note, we have not checked any O or I yet. So both ""ROUSE"" and ""RINSE"" are candidates.

I think ""ROUSE"" might be better because we include O and U which are vowels we haven't checked.

So, guess: ROUSE.

Reasoning:
- Ends with E: good.
- Has R at position 1 (so not at position 2, which we know is wrong).
- Uses new letters: O, U, S (which haven't been tried).
- S wasn't in the first guess? We had C,R,A,T,E so S is new.

But wait, in the feedback, we know that R is in the word, but we don't know where. By placing it at position 1, we can test if R is at position 1 or not. If it's correct, great; if it's present but wrong position, then we know it must be at position 3 or 4.

Similarly, we are testing O, U, S.

So, ""ROUSE"" seems a good choice.

There's also ""RUBLE"" but B and L are also new? But E is at the end. However, ""ROUSE"" uses common letters.

Another word: ""PRIDE"" but P R I D E: R is at position 2? No, position 2 is R, which is not allowed because we know R is not in position 2 in the secret word? Wait, feedback said R(-) for position 2 meaning that R is in the word but not at position 2. So in a new guess, if we put R at position 2, it will again be marked as '-' since it's present but wrong position? But if R is actually at position 2, it would be marked as correct? But in reality, we know it's not at position 2, so placing at position 2 is wasteful because it will only get '-'.

Therefore, to save positions and get better feedback, it's best to avoid putting R at position 2 again.

So ""PRIDE"" places R in position 2, which is not good.

Avoid R in position 2.

Therefore, ""ROUSE"" is a solid choice.

Let me confirm spelling: ROUSE - it's a valid word meaning to stir or awaken.

So, I will guess ""ROUSE"".

But in the feedback, E was correct, so the word ends with E. We are respecting that.

Also, we are avoiding A, C, T.

Therefore, guess: ROUSE.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crate"":
- C, A, T are **not** in the secret word (indicated by ""x"").
- R is in the secret word but **not** in the second position (indicated by ""-"").
- E is in the secret word and in the **correct** fifth position (indicated by ""✓"").

Therefore:
- The secret word **ends with E**.
- R **must appear** in position 1, 3, or 4 (since position 2 is incorrect).
- New guess should **avoid C, A, T** and include R in an untried position (not position 2).
- Prioritize testing common vowels/consonants not yet ruled out: O, U, S, I, etc.

With this in mind, ""ROUSE"" is a strategic guess:
- Ends with E (respects the correct position).
- Places R in position 1 (tests if R is in position 1).
- Introduces new vowels O and U, and consonant S.
- Avoids C, A, T.

Let\'s check:\n- P is not excluded\n- R is included, and we can put R in position 1? In ""prose"", R is at position 2? Oh, no: P (1), R (2), O (3), S (4), E (5). But in this case, R is in the second position. We know from feedback that R is not in position 2? Wait, the feedback said R(-) meaning R is in the word but not in the second position? Correct!

We are now on the third guess. Let's analyze the feedback from both guesses.

From Guess 1 (""crate""):
- C: not in the word (x)
- R: in the word but wrong position (-) — so R is present, but not in position 2
- A: not in the word (x)
- T: not in the word (x)
- E: correct and in position 5 (✓)

From Guess 2 (""rouse""):
- R: in the word but wrong position (-) — so R is present, but not in position 1 (since we placed it at position 1 and got '-')
- O: not in the word (x)
- U: not in the word (x)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: correct and in position 5 (✓)

Now, combining the information:

1. The word ends with E (position 5 is E and correct).
2. R is in the word, but it is not in position 1 (from guess 2) and not in position 2 (from guess 1). Therefore, R must be in position 3 or 4 (since position 5 is E, so R cannot be there).
3. The following letters are not in the word: C, A, T, O, U, S.

We also know that from guess 1, we had R in position 2 (wrong) and in guess 2, R in position 1 (wrong). So R must be in position 3 or 4.

Additionally, we have eliminated several common letters: C, A, T, O, U, S.

Now, we need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (position 5)
- Contains R in position 3 or 4
- Does not contain C, A, T, O, U, S
- Uses new letters to get more information

Available letters: We have not used B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we need common ones.

Since R must be in position 3 or 4, let's consider both cases.

First, if R is in position 3: then the word is _ _ R _ E

If R is in position 4: then the word is _ _ _ R E

We need to test other common letters. We haven't tested I, L, N, D, etc.

We also need to avoid the eliminated letters.

Let me think of words that fit.

Option 1: R in position 3: _ _ R _ E

Possible words: 
- BIRDE? Not a word. 
- DIRGE? D I R G E — that's a word (meaning a lament). 
- But we don't know if G is in the word.

Option 2: R in position 4: _ _ _ R E

Possible words:
- LARGE? But A is eliminated, so no.
- MIRRE? Not a word.
- PIER? Only 4 letters.
- We need 5 letters: e.g., ""PUREE"" but U is eliminated.

Another idea: ""WRIE"" is not 5 letters.

Let's list possible words:

For R in position 3: 
- DIRGE: D I R G E
- FIRED? But E is at the end, and we have E at position 5, but if we put E at position 5, then ""FIRED"" has E at 5 and also E at 4? No, ""FIRED"" is F-I-R-E-D, so E is at position 4, not 5. We need E at 5.

So for R in position 3: the pattern is _ _ R _ E

Examples:
- BIRLE? Not common.
- GIRSE? Not a word.
- HIREE? H I R E E — but that has two E's? H-I-R-E-E, so positions: 1:H, 2:I, 3:R, 4:E, 5:E — but position 4 is E and position 5 is E. But we know position 5 is E, but we don't know about position 4. However, ""HIREE"" is a word.

But we have eliminated S, but not H or I.

Similarly, ""DIRGE"" is D-I-R-G-E.

Another: ""WIRED"" but that ends with D, not E.

""VIRED"" not a word.

""JIVED"" but no R.

So let's consider R in position 4: _ _ _ R E

Examples:
- BORNE? But O is eliminated.
- BIRSE? But S is eliminated and also not ending with E? BIRSE is B-I-R-S-E, so E at 5, but S is eliminated.
- PIECE? But E at 5, but we have two E's? P-I-E-C-E, but C is eliminated.
- So we need a word with pattern _ _ _ R E, without C,A,T,O,U,S.

Possible words:
- LIRE? 4 letters.
- MIRE? 4 letters.
- WIRE? 4 letters.
- We need 5 letters: e.g., ""ADORE"" but A and O eliminated.
- ""ELITE"" but no R and E at position 1? E-L-I-T-E, but T eliminated and no R.

Another idea: ""PRIDE"" but we have P-R-I-D-E, but R is at position 2? We know R cannot be at position 2. In ""PRIDE"", R is at position 2, which we must avoid.

We need R at position 3 or 4.

Back to R at position 4: _ _ _ R E

What about ""FJORD""? But ends with D, not E.

""LYRE"" is 4 letters.

""PYRE"" 4 letters.

""TYRE"" 4 letters and T eliminated.

Perhaps ""BRIBE""? B-R-I-B-E, but R is at position 2? We cannot have R at position 2. In ""BRIBE"", R is at position 2, which is forbidden.

We must avoid position 2 for R.

So for R at position 4, the word is _ _ _ R E.

Let me search for words: 
- ""QUIRE"" but Q and U? U is eliminated.
- ""INURE"" but U eliminated.
- ""AWARE"" but A and W? A eliminated.

Perhaps ""EMBER""? E-M-B-E-R — but E at position 1 and 4? And R at position 5? But we need R at position 4? Pattern: position 1: E, 2: M, 3: B, 4: E, 5: R — but we need E at position 5, not R. So no.

We need the last letter to be E.

Another word: ""OGRES"" but O and S eliminated.

""EGRET"" but E at 1, G, R at 3, E at 4, T at 5 — but T eliminated and E at 5 is not, we have E at 5 must be, but here T is at 5.

I'm struggling. Let's think of common words ending with E that have R in position 3 or 4.

Position 3: _ _ R _ E
- Examples: dire, but 4 letters; fire, 4; hire, 4; mire, 4; tire, 4; wire, 4.
5-letter: shire, but S eliminated; spire, S; tired, T eliminated; wired, but ends with D? W-I-R-E-D, so D at 5, not E.

""TRIBE"" but T and R at 2? T eliminated and R at position 2 forbidden.

""GRIME"" G-R-I-M-E — R at position 2, forbidden.

""PRIME"" P-R-I-M-E — R at position 2, forbidden.

""DRIVE"" D-R-I-V-E — R at position 2, forbidden.

It seems many words have R at position 2. But we cannot use that.

So let's focus on R at position 3.

_ _ R _ E

5-letter words:
- BIRLE: not common, but B-I-R-L-E
- CIRCE: C eliminated
- DIRGE: D-I-R-G-E — valid
- FIRED: F-I-R-E-D — ends with D, not E
- HIRED: H-I-R-E-D — ends with D
- LIRNE: not a word
- MIRED: M-I-R-E-D — ends with D
- SIREN: S-I-R-E-N — but S eliminated, and ends with N? S-I-R-E-N, so E at 4, N at 5, not E at 5.
- TIRED: T eliminated
- WIRED: ends with D

So ""DIRGE"" is a candidate: D-I-R-G-E

Similarly, ""VIRGA"" not ending with E.

""JIBE"" 4 letters.

Another word: ""HIREE"" — H-I-R-E-E, which is a word (meaning a person hired). So positions: 1:H, 2:I, 3:R, 4:E, 5:E

This has E at position 4 and 5. We know position 5 is E, but position 4 might be E or not. But in this case, we have E at 4, which is new.

But we can use ""HIREE"".

Similarly, ""DIVVE"" not a word.

""KIRBE"" not a word.

So candidates: ""DIRGE"" and ""HIREE"".

But ""HIREE"" has two E's, which might be less common, but it's valid.

We also have the option of R at position 4.

For R at position 4: _ _ _ R E

Words:
- BORNE: O eliminated
- CORNE: C and O eliminated
- DARRE: not a word, A eliminated
- FERME: not common, F-E-R-M-E? But R at position 3? F(1)E(2)R(3)M(4)E(5) — so R at 3, not 4.
- GARRE: not a word
- HERSE: H-E-R-S-E — but S eliminated, and R at position 3.
- LERNE: not common
- PERVE: not standard
- TERRE: T eliminated
- WERRE: not a word

""AZURE"" but A and U eliminated.

""EMBARK"" not ending with E.

""IMBUE"" no R and U eliminated.

Perhaps ""LYRE"" is 4 letters.

""PYRE"" 4.

""TYRE"" 4.

I think R at position 4 is harder. Let's consider ""OAKER"" not a word.

Another idea: ""LARGE"" but A eliminated.

""MERGE"" M-E-R-G-E — R at position 3, not 4.

""VERGE"" V-E-R-G-E — R at 3.

""DIRGE"" has R at 3.

So for now, let's go with ""DIRGE"" or ""HIREE"".

But in ""HIREE"", we have E at position 4, which might be redundant if the word has only one E, but we don't know.

We need to test new letters.

In ""DIRGE"", we have D, I, G, and E (but E is known).

In ""HIREE"", we have H, I, and E (twice).

We haven't tested I, D, G, H, etc.

Also, we need to avoid the eliminated letters.

Another word: ""BIRSE"" but S eliminated.

""FIRIE"" not a word.

Perhaps ""RIPED"" but ends with D.

I think ""DIRGE"" is a good choice: D-I-R-G-E.

- It has R in position 3, which is a possible position.
- It introduces new letters: D, I, G.
- Ends with E.

We can also consider ""WRIED"" but ends with D.

Or ""TRIED"" T eliminated.

So I think ""DIRGE"" is a reasonable guess.

But let's confirm the pattern: D(1), I(2), R(3), G(4), E(5). So R is at position 3, which is untried.

Similarly, we are testing I at position 2 and G at position 4.

We are not using any eliminated letters.

So, I'll go with ""DIRGE"".

But we have to be careful: if the word has only one E, and we put E at position 4, it might be marked as present or not, but in ""DIRGE"", position 4 is G, not E. Position 4 is G, position 5 is E.

In ""DIRGE"", the E is only at position 5, which is correct, so we don't test for additional E's.

In ""HIREE"", we have E at position 4 and 5, so if position 4 is not E, it might be marked as absent or present but wrong position.

But since we don't know, let's stick with ""DIRGE"".

Another word: ""BRIBE"" but R at position 2 forbidden.

""PRICE"" P-R-I-C-E — R at position 2 forbidden and C eliminated.

So, ""DIRGE"" it is.

But let's see if there's a word with R at position 4.

For example, ""ENDUE"" no R.

""UNDER"" ends with R, not E.

""OLDER"" O eliminated.

""ELDER"" E-L-D-E-R — ends with R, not E.

""UMBER"" U eliminated.

""AMBER"" A eliminated.

I think it's difficult, so ""DIRGE"" is fine.

Perhaps ""RIPEN"" but ends with N.

""GRIPE"" G-R-I-P-E — R at position 2 forbidden.

So, I think we should guess ""DIRGE"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crate"" → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) T(x) E(✓)**  
  - C, A, T are **absent** from the secret word.  
  - R is **present** but not in position 2.  
  - E is **correct** in position 5 (so the secret word ends with E).  

- **Guess 2: ""rouse"" → Feedback: R(-) O(x) U(x) S(x) E(✓)**  
  - R is **present** but not in position 1 (since it was marked ""-"" in position 1).  
  - O, U, S are **absent**.  
  - E is **correct** in position 5 (reconfirmed).  

### Key Deductions:
1. **Fixed Position**: Position 5 must be **E**.  
2. **R Position**: R is in the word but **not in position 1 or 2** (from feedback). Since position 5 is E, R must be in **position 3 or 4**.  
3. **Absent Letters**: C, A, T, O, U, S are eliminated. Avoid using these.  
4. **Strategy for Next Guess**:  
   - Must end with **E** (position 5).  
   - Must include **R in position 3 or 4** (to test its location).  
   - Use new, common letters to maximize information (e.g., I, D, G, L, N).  
   - Avoid repeating positions for R (positions 1 and 2 are invalid for R).  

### Choosing the Next Guess:
After evaluating possible words that fit the constraints (e.g., ending with E, R in position 3 or 4, no eliminated letters), **""dirge""** is a strong candidate:  
- **Structure**: D-I-R-G-E  
  - R is in **position 3** (untried position, testing if R is here).  
  - Ends with E (position 5 correct).  
- **New Letters**: Tests **D, I, G** (common letters not yet tried).  
- **Information Gain**:  
  - If R is marked ""✓"", it confirms position 3. If ""-"", R must be in position 4.  
  - Feedback on D, I, G will reveal if they are present/absent or in the correct positions.  

Other considered words (e.g., ""hiree"") were rejected due to redundancy (e.g., double E) or less common usage. ""Dirge"" is a valid 5-letter word meaning ""a lament for the dead,"" fitting the game's vocabulary.

1. The word ends with E (position 5 is E and correct).
2. R is in the word, but it is not in position 1 (from guess 2) and not in position 2 (from guess 1). Therefore, R must be in position 3 or 4 (since position 5 is E, so R cannot be there).
3. The following letters are not in the word: C, A, T, O, U, S.

We also know that from guess 1, we had R in position 2 (wrong) and in guess 2, R in position 1 (wrong). So R must be in position 3 or 4.

Additionally, we have eliminated several common letters: C, A, T, O, U, S.

Now, we need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (position 5)
- Contains R in position 3 or 4
- Does not contain C, A, T, O, U, S
- Uses new letters to get more information

Available letters: We have not used B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we need common ones.

Since R must be in position 3 or 4, let's consider both cases.

First, if R is in position 3: then the word is _ _ R _ E

If R is in position 4: then the word is _ _ _ R E

We need to test other common letters. We haven't tested I, L, N, D, etc.

We also need to avoid the eliminated letters.

Let me think of words that fit.

Option 1: R in position 3: _ _ R _ E

Possible words: 
- BIRDE? Not a word. 
- DIRGE? D I R G E — that's a word (meaning a lament). 
- But we don't know if G is in the word.

Option 2: R in position 4: _ _ _ R E

Possible words:
- LARGE? But A is eliminated, so no.
- MIRRE? Not a word.
- PIER? Only 4 letters.
- We need 5 letters: e.g., ""PUREE"" but U is eliminated.

Another idea: ""WRIE"" is not 5 letters.

Let's list possible words:

For R in position 3: 
- DIRGE: D I R G E
- FIRED? But E is at the end, and we have E at position 5, but if we put E at position 5, then ""FIRED"" has E at 5 and also E at 4? No, ""FIRED"" is F-I-R-E-D, so E is at position 4, not 5. We need E at 5.

So for R in position 3: the pattern is _ _ R _ E

Examples:
- BIRLE? Not common.
- GIRSE? Not a word.
- HIREE? H I R E E — but that has two E's? H-I-R-E-E, so positions: 1:H, 2:I, 3:R, 4:E, 5:E — but position 4 is E and position 5 is E. But we know position 5 is E, but we don't know about position 4. However, ""HIREE"" is a word.

But we have eliminated S, but not H or I.

Similarly, ""DIRGE"" is D-I-R-G-E.

Another: ""WIRED"" but that ends with D, not E.

""VIRED"" not a word.

""JIVED"" but no R.

So let's consider R in position 4: _ _ _ R E

Examples:
- BORNE? But O is eliminated.
- BIRSE? But S is eliminated and also not ending with E? BIRSE is B-I-R-S-E, so E at 5, but S is eliminated.
- PIECE? But E at 5, but we have two E's? P-I-E-C-E, but C is eliminated.
- So we need a word with pattern _ _ _ R E, without C,A,T,O,U,S.

Possible words:
- LIRE? 4 letters.
- MIRE? 4 letters.
- WIRE? 4 letters.
- We need 5 letters: e.g., ""ADORE"" but A and O eliminated.
- ""ELITE"" but no R and E at position 1? E-L-I-T-E, but T eliminated and no R.

Another idea: ""PRIDE"" but we have P-R-I-D-E, but R is at position 2? We know R cannot be at position 2. In ""PRIDE"", R is at position 2, which we must avoid.

We need R at position 3 or 4.

Back to R at position 4: _ _ _ R E

What about ""FJORD""? But ends with D, not E.

""LYRE"" is 4 letters.

""PYRE"" 4 letters.

""TYRE"" 4 letters and T eliminated.

Perhaps ""BRIBE""? B-R-I-B-E, but R is at position 2? We cannot have R at position 2. In ""BRIBE"", R is at position 2, which is forbidden.

We must avoid position 2 for R.

So for R at position 4, the word is _ _ _ R E.

Let me search for words: 
- ""QUIRE"" but Q and U? U is eliminated.
- ""INURE"" but U eliminated.
- ""AWARE"" but A and W? A eliminated.

Perhaps ""EMBER""? E-M-B-E-R — but E at position 1 and 4? And R at position 5? But we need R at position 4? Pattern: position 1: E, 2: M, 3: B, 4: E, 5: R — but we need E at position 5, not R. So no.

We need the last letter to be E.

Another word: ""OGRES"" but O and S eliminated.

""EGRET"" but E at 1, G, R at 3, E at 4, T at 5 — but T eliminated and E at 5 is not, we have E at 5 must be, but here T is at 5.

I'm struggling. Let's think of common words ending with E that have R in position 3 or 4.

Position 3: _ _ R _ E
- Examples: dire, but 4 letters; fire, 4; hire, 4; mire, 4; tire, 4; wire, 4.
5-letter: shire, but S eliminated; spire, S; tired, T eliminated; wired, but ends with D? W-I-R-E-D, so D at 5, not E.

""TRIBE"" but T and R at 2? T eliminated and R at position 2 forbidden.

""GRIME"" G-R-I-M-E — R at position 2, forbidden.

""PRIME"" P-R-I-M-E — R at position 2, forbidden.

""DRIVE"" D-R-I-V-E — R at position 2, forbidden.

It seems many words have R at position 2. But we cannot use that.

So let's focus on R at position 3.

_ _ R _ E

5-letter words:
- BIRLE: not common, but B-I-R-L-E
- CIRCE: C eliminated
- DIRGE: D-I-R-G-E — valid
- FIRED: F-I-R-E-D — ends with D, not E
- HIRED: H-I-R-E-D — ends with D
- LIRNE: not a word
- MIRED: M-I-R-E-D — ends with D
- SIREN: S-I-R-E-N — but S eliminated, and ends with N? S-I-R-E-N, so E at 4, N at 5, not E at 5.
- TIRED: T eliminated
- WIRED: ends with D

So ""DIRGE"" is a candidate: D-I-R-G-E

Similarly, ""VIRGA"" not ending with E.

""JIBE"" 4 letters.

Another word: ""HIREE"" — H-I-R-E-E, which is a word (meaning a person hired). So positions: 1:H, 2:I, 3:R, 4:E, 5:E

This has E at position 4 and 5. We know position 5 is E, but position 4 might be E or not. But in this case, we have E at 4, which is new.

But we can use ""HIREE"".

Similarly, ""DIVVE"" not a word.

""KIRBE"" not a word.

So candidates: ""DIRGE"" and ""HIREE"".

But ""HIREE"" has two E's, which might be less common, but it's valid.

We also have the option of R at position 4.

For R at position 4: _ _ _ R E

Words:
- BORNE: O eliminated
- CORNE: C and O eliminated
- DARRE: not a word, A eliminated
- FERME: not common, F-E-R-M-E? But R at position 3? F(1)E(2)R(3)M(4)E(5) — so R at 3, not 4.
- GARRE: not a word
- HERSE: H-E-R-S-E — but S eliminated, and R at position 3.
- LERNE: not common
- PERVE: not standard
- TERRE: T eliminated
- WERRE: not a word

""AZURE"" but A and U eliminated.

""EMBARK"" not ending with E.

""IMBUE"" no R and U eliminated.

Perhaps ""LYRE"" is 4 letters.

""PYRE"" 4.

""TYRE"" 4.

I think R at position 4 is harder. Let's consider ""OAKER"" not a word.

Another idea: ""LARGE"" but A eliminated.

""MERGE"" M-E-R-G-E — R at position 3, not 4.

""VERGE"" V-E-R-G-E — R at 3.

""DIRGE"" has R at 3.

So for now, let's go with ""DIRGE"" or ""HIREE"".

But in ""HIREE"", we have E at position 4, which might be redundant if the word has only one E, but we don't know.

We need to test new letters.

In ""DIRGE"", we have D, I, G, and E (but E is known).

In ""HIREE"", we have H, I, and E (twice).

We haven't tested I, D, G, H, etc.

Also, we need to avoid the eliminated letters.

Another word: ""BIRSE"" but S eliminated.

""FIRIE"" not a word.

Perhaps ""RIPED"" but ends with D.

I think ""DIRGE"" is a good choice: D-I-R-G-E.

- It has R in position 3, which is a possible position.
- It introduces new letters: D, I, G.
- Ends with E.

We can also consider ""WRIED"" but ends with D.

Or ""TRIED"" T eliminated.

So I think ""DIRGE"" is a reasonable guess.

But let's confirm the pattern: D(1), I(2), R(3), G(4), E(5). So R is at position 3, which is untried.

Similarly, we are testing I at position 2 and G at position 4.

We are not using any eliminated letters.

So, I'll go with ""DIRGE"".

But we have to be careful: if the word has only one E, and we put E at position 4, it might be marked as present or not, but in ""DIRGE"", position 4 is G, not E. Position 4 is G, position 5 is E.

In ""DIRGE"", the E is only at position 5, which is correct, so we don't test for additional E's.

In ""HIREE"", we have E at position 4 and 5, so if position 4 is not E, it might be marked as absent or present but wrong position.

But since we don't know, let's stick with ""DIRGE"".

Another word: ""BRIBE"" but R at position 2 forbidden.

""PRICE"" P-R-I-C-E — R at position 2 forbidden and C eliminated.

So, ""DIRGE"" it is.

But let's see if there's a word with R at position 4.

For example, ""ENDUE"" no R.

""UNDER"" ends with R, not E.

""OLDER"" O eliminated.

""ELDER"" E-L-D-E-R — ends with R, not E.

""UMBER"" U eliminated.

""AMBER"" A eliminated.

I think it's difficult, so ""DIRGE"" is fine.

Perhaps ""RIPEN"" but ends with N.

""GRIPE"" G-R-I-P-E — R at position 2 forbidden.

So, I think we should guess ""DIRGE"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crate"" → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) T(x) E(✓)**  
  - C, A, T are **absent** from the secret word.  
  - R is **present** but not in position 2.  
  - E is **correct** in position 5 (so the secret word ends with E).  

- **Guess 2: ""rouse"" → Feedback: R(-) O(x) U(x) S(x) E(✓)**  
  - R is **present** but not in position 1 (since it was marked ""-"" in position 1).  
  - O, U, S are **absent**.  
  - E is **correct** in position 5 (reconfirmed).  

### Key Deductions:
1. **Fixed Position**: Position 5 must be **E**.  
2. **R Position**: R is in the word but **not in position 1 or 2** (from feedback). Since position 5 is E, R must be in **position 3 or 4**.  
3. **Absent Letters**: C, A, T, O, U, S are eliminated. Avoid using these.  
4. **Strategy for Next Guess**:  
   - Must end with **E** (position 5).  
   - Must include **R in position 3 or 4** (to test its location).  
   - Use new, common letters to maximize information (e.g., I, D, G, L, N).  
   - Avoid repeating positions for R (positions 1 and 2 are invalid for R).  

### Choosing the Next Guess:
After evaluating possible words that fit the constraints (e.g., ending with E, R in position 3 or 4, no eliminated letters), **""dirge""** is a strong candidate:  
- **Structure**: D-I-R-G-E  
  - R is in **position 3** (untried position, testing if R is here).  
  - Ends with E (position 5 correct).  
- **New Letters**: Tests **D, I, G** (common letters not yet tried).  
- **Information Gain**:  
  - If R is marked ""✓"", it confirms position 3. If ""-"", R must be in position 4.  
  - Feedback on D, I, G will reveal if they are present/absent or in the correct positions.  

Other considered words (e.g., ""hiree"") were rejected due to redundancy (e.g., double E) or less common usage. ""Dirge"" is a valid 5-letter word meaning ""a lament for the dead,"" fitting the game's vocabulary.",Guess 3: dirge -> FEEDBACK: D(x) I(x) R(✓) G(x) E(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,NERVE,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback. For the first guess, we want to choose a word that commonly contains vowels and common consonants to maximize the information we get from the feedback.
Common starting words in games like Wordle are words with multiple vowels and common letters. Examples include ""CRATE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ADIEU"", ""STARE"", etc.
Since we don't know the secret word, we should pick a word that uses five distinct letters to cover more ground.

I think ""CRATE"" is a good starting word because:
- It contains two common vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (C, R, T).
- All letters are distinct.

So, for the first guess, I will go with ""CRATE"".

Let me output the guess accordingly.For the first guess, I'll choose a word that maximizes information gain by covering common vowels and consonants. ""CRATE"" is a strong starting word because it:
- Includes 3 common consonants (C, R, T) and 2 vowels (A, E)
- Has all distinct letters to optimize feedback coverage
- Frequently appears in vocabulary games like Wordle as an effective opener

<guess>crate</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crate -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are now on the second guess. The previous feedback for ""crate"" was:
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: t (x) (not in the word) -> Correction: the feedback shows A(x) meaning A is not present
- T: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the last letter and is correct)

So, from feedback:
- The secret word has an R, but not as the second letter (since in ""crate"", R was in position 2 and it's marked as wrong position).
- The secret word has an E in the fifth position (since E was correct there).
- Letters C, A, T are not in the word at all.

Therefore, we know:
- The word ends with E.
- R is present somewhere but not in the second position. Possible positions for R: 1, 3, or 4 (since 2 is wrong and 5 is E).
- We must avoid using C, A, T in the new guess.

Now, we need to form a five-letter word that ends with E and includes an R (but not in position 2). Also, we want to test other common vowels and consonants to get more information.

Since E is fixed at the end, let's brainstorm words ending with E that have R not in the second position.

Common consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, but excluding C, A, T.

Vowels we haven't checked: O, I, U (since A is out). We also know E is at the end, but there might be other E's? The feedback for E was only for position 5. We don't know if there are other E's, but since position 5 is E, and we have only one correct, we should consider that E might appear twice? But typically, we start without assuming duplicate letters unless feedback suggests.

In the first guess, we had E at the end and it was correct. But note, we don't know if E is present elsewhere because we only had one E. But since A is excluded, we might want to try another vowel.

Possible vowels to test: O, I, U.

We also note that R is present, so we can place R at the beginning or in the middle.

Let me try to think of words with R in position 1, 3, or 4 and E at the end.

Examples:
- If R is at position 1: words like R__ _ E. e.g., RUPEE, but that has two E's? 
- But we must avoid A, C, T.

Better to choose a word that uses new letters to maximize information.

Idea: ""PROSE"" - but P, R, O, S, E. Let's check:
- P is not excluded
- R is included, and we can put R in position 1? In ""prose"", R is at position 2? Oh, no: P (1), R (2), O (3), S (4), E (5). But in this case, R is in the second position. We know from feedback that R is not in position 2? Wait, the feedback said R(-) meaning R is in the word but not in the second position? Correct! So if I put R in position 2 again, it will be wrong.

Therefore, we cannot have R in position 2 for the new guess. So ""prose"" has R in position 2: not allowed.

We need a word where R is not in position 2 and E is at the end.

Alternative: place R in position 1: e.g., ""ROUSE"" - R O U S E. 
- Positions: R(1), O(2), U(3), S(4), E(5)
- But O is in position 2, which we haven't tested. Letter S is also new.

This might be a good choice? But let's confirm: we aren't using C, A, T. R is at position 1, which is good because we know R isn't at position 2, so trying at position 1 is new.

Another option: ""RINSE"" - R I N S E. R at position 1, I at position 2, etc.

We could try to include O to check for that vowel.

But note, we have not checked any O or I yet. So both ""ROUSE"" and ""RINSE"" are candidates.

I think ""ROUSE"" might be better because we include O and U which are vowels we haven't checked.

So, guess: ROUSE.

Reasoning:
- Ends with E: good.
- Has R at position 1 (so not at position 2, which we know is wrong).
- Uses new letters: O, U, S (which haven't been tried).
- S wasn't in the first guess? We had C,R,A,T,E so S is new.

But wait, in the feedback, we know that R is in the word, but we don't know where. By placing it at position 1, we can test if R is at position 1 or not. If it's correct, great; if it's present but wrong position, then we know it must be at position 3 or 4.

Similarly, we are testing O, U, S.

So, ""ROUSE"" seems a good choice.

There's also ""RUBLE"" but B and L are also new? But E is at the end. However, ""ROUSE"" uses common letters.

Another word: ""PRIDE"" but P R I D E: R is at position 2? No, position 2 is R, which is not allowed because we know R is not in position 2 in the secret word? Wait, feedback said R(-) for position 2 meaning that R is in the word but not at position 2. So in a new guess, if we put R at position 2, it will again be marked as '-' since it's present but wrong position? But if R is actually at position 2, it would be marked as correct? But in reality, we know it's not at position 2, so placing at position 2 is wasteful because it will only get '-'.

Therefore, to save positions and get better feedback, it's best to avoid putting R at position 2 again.

So ""PRIDE"" places R in position 2, which is not good.

Avoid R in position 2.

Therefore, ""ROUSE"" is a solid choice.

Let me confirm spelling: ROUSE - it's a valid word meaning to stir or awaken.

So, I will guess ""ROUSE"".

But in the feedback, E was correct, so the word ends with E. We are respecting that.

Also, we are avoiding A, C, T.

Therefore, guess: ROUSE.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crate"":
- C, A, T are **not** in the secret word (indicated by ""x"").
- R is in the secret word but **not** in the second position (indicated by ""-"").
- E is in the secret word and in the **correct** fifth position (indicated by ""✓"").

Therefore:
- The secret word **ends with E**.
- R **must appear** in position 1, 3, or 4 (since position 2 is incorrect).
- New guess should **avoid C, A, T** and include R in an untried position (not position 2).
- Prioritize testing common vowels/consonants not yet ruled out: O, U, S, I, etc.

With this in mind, ""ROUSE"" is a strategic guess:
- Ends with E (respects the correct position).
- Places R in position 1 (tests if R is in position 1).
- Introduces new vowels O and U, and consonant S.
- Avoids C, A, T.

<guess>rouse</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crate -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: rouse -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) U(x) S(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are now on the third guess. Let's analyze the feedback from both guesses.

From Guess 1 (""crate""):
- C: not in the word (x)
- R: in the word but wrong position (-) — so R is present, but not in position 2
- A: not in the word (x)
- T: not in the word (x)
- E: correct and in position 5 (✓)

From Guess 2 (""rouse""):
- R: in the word but wrong position (-) — so R is present, but not in position 1 (since we placed it at position 1 and got '-')
- O: not in the word (x)
- U: not in the word (x)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: correct and in position 5 (✓)

Now, combining the information:

1. The word ends with E (position 5 is E and correct).
2. R is in the word, but it is not in position 1 (from guess 2) and not in position 2 (from guess 1). Therefore, R must be in position 3 or 4 (since position 5 is E, so R cannot be there).
3. The following letters are not in the word: C, A, T, O, U, S.

We also know that from guess 1, we had R in position 2 (wrong) and in guess 2, R in position 1 (wrong). So R must be in position 3 or 4.

Additionally, we have eliminated several common letters: C, A, T, O, U, S.

Now, we need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (position 5)
- Contains R in position 3 or 4
- Does not contain C, A, T, O, U, S
- Uses new letters to get more information

Available letters: We have not used B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we need common ones.

Since R must be in position 3 or 4, let's consider both cases.

First, if R is in position 3: then the word is _ _ R _ E

If R is in position 4: then the word is _ _ _ R E

We need to test other common letters. We haven't tested I, L, N, D, etc.

We also need to avoid the eliminated letters.

Let me think of words that fit.

Option 1: R in position 3: _ _ R _ E

Possible words: 
- BIRDE? Not a word. 
- DIRGE? D I R G E — that's a word (meaning a lament). 
- But we don't know if G is in the word.

Option 2: R in position 4: _ _ _ R E

Possible words:
- LARGE? But A is eliminated, so no.
- MIRRE? Not a word.
- PIER? Only 4 letters.
- We need 5 letters: e.g., ""PUREE"" but U is eliminated.

Another idea: ""WRIE"" is not 5 letters.

Let's list possible words:

For R in position 3: 
- DIRGE: D I R G E
- FIRED? But E is at the end, and we have E at position 5, but if we put E at position 5, then ""FIRED"" has E at 5 and also E at 4? No, ""FIRED"" is F-I-R-E-D, so E is at position 4, not 5. We need E at 5.

So for R in position 3: the pattern is _ _ R _ E

Examples:
- BIRLE? Not common.
- GIRSE? Not a word.
- HIREE? H I R E E — but that has two E's? H-I-R-E-E, so positions: 1:H, 2:I, 3:R, 4:E, 5:E — but position 4 is E and position 5 is E. But we know position 5 is E, but we don't know about position 4. However, ""HIREE"" is a word.

But we have eliminated S, but not H or I.

Similarly, ""DIRGE"" is D-I-R-G-E.

Another: ""WIRED"" but that ends with D, not E.

""VIRED"" not a word.

""JIVED"" but no R.

So let's consider R in position 4: _ _ _ R E

Examples:
- BORNE? But O is eliminated.
- BIRSE? But S is eliminated and also not ending with E? BIRSE is B-I-R-S-E, so E at 5, but S is eliminated.
- PIECE? But E at 5, but we have two E's? P-I-E-C-E, but C is eliminated.
- So we need a word with pattern _ _ _ R E, without C,A,T,O,U,S.

Possible words:
- LIRE? 4 letters.
- MIRE? 4 letters.
- WIRE? 4 letters.
- We need 5 letters: e.g., ""ADORE"" but A and O eliminated.
- ""ELITE"" but no R and E at position 1? E-L-I-T-E, but T eliminated and no R.

Another idea: ""PRIDE"" but we have P-R-I-D-E, but R is at position 2? We know R cannot be at position 2. In ""PRIDE"", R is at position 2, which we must avoid.

We need R at position 3 or 4.

Back to R at position 4: _ _ _ R E

What about ""FJORD""? But ends with D, not E.

""LYRE"" is 4 letters.

""PYRE"" 4 letters.

""TYRE"" 4 letters and T eliminated.

Perhaps ""BRIBE""? B-R-I-B-E, but R is at position 2? We cannot have R at position 2. In ""BRIBE"", R is at position 2, which is forbidden.

We must avoid position 2 for R.

So for R at position 4, the word is _ _ _ R E.

Let me search for words: 
- ""QUIRE"" but Q and U? U is eliminated.
- ""INURE"" but U eliminated.
- ""AWARE"" but A and W? A eliminated.

Perhaps ""EMBER""? E-M-B-E-R — but E at position 1 and 4? And R at position 5? But we need R at position 4? Pattern: position 1: E, 2: M, 3: B, 4: E, 5: R — but we need E at position 5, not R. So no.

We need the last letter to be E.

Another word: ""OGRES"" but O and S eliminated.

""EGRET"" but E at 1, G, R at 3, E at 4, T at 5 — but T eliminated and E at 5 is not, we have E at 5 must be, but here T is at 5.

I'm struggling. Let's think of common words ending with E that have R in position 3 or 4.

Position 3: _ _ R _ E
- Examples: dire, but 4 letters; fire, 4; hire, 4; mire, 4; tire, 4; wire, 4.
5-letter: shire, but S eliminated; spire, S; tired, T eliminated; wired, but ends with D? W-I-R-E-D, so D at 5, not E.

""TRIBE"" but T and R at 2? T eliminated and R at position 2 forbidden.

""GRIME"" G-R-I-M-E — R at position 2, forbidden.

""PRIME"" P-R-I-M-E — R at position 2, forbidden.

""DRIVE"" D-R-I-V-E — R at position 2, forbidden.

It seems many words have R at position 2. But we cannot use that.

So let's focus on R at position 3.

_ _ R _ E

5-letter words:
- BIRLE: not common, but B-I-R-L-E
- CIRCE: C eliminated
- DIRGE: D-I-R-G-E — valid
- FIRED: F-I-R-E-D — ends with D, not E
- HIRED: H-I-R-E-D — ends with D
- LIRNE: not a word
- MIRED: M-I-R-E-D — ends with D
- SIREN: S-I-R-E-N — but S eliminated, and ends with N? S-I-R-E-N, so E at 4, N at 5, not E at 5.
- TIRED: T eliminated
- WIRED: ends with D

So ""DIRGE"" is a candidate: D-I-R-G-E

Similarly, ""VIRGA"" not ending with E.

""JIBE"" 4 letters.

Another word: ""HIREE"" — H-I-R-E-E, which is a word (meaning a person hired). So positions: 1:H, 2:I, 3:R, 4:E, 5:E

This has E at position 4 and 5. We know position 5 is E, but position 4 might be E or not. But in this case, we have E at 4, which is new.

But we can use ""HIREE"".

Similarly, ""DIVVE"" not a word.

""KIRBE"" not a word.

So candidates: ""DIRGE"" and ""HIREE"".

But ""HIREE"" has two E's, which might be less common, but it's valid.

We also have the option of R at position 4.

For R at position 4: _ _ _ R E

Words:
- BORNE: O eliminated
- CORNE: C and O eliminated
- DARRE: not a word, A eliminated
- FERME: not common, F-E-R-M-E? But R at position 3? F(1)E(2)R(3)M(4)E(5) — so R at 3, not 4.
- GARRE: not a word
- HERSE: H-E-R-S-E — but S eliminated, and R at position 3.
- LERNE: not common
- PERVE: not standard
- TERRE: T eliminated
- WERRE: not a word

""AZURE"" but A and U eliminated.

""EMBARK"" not ending with E.

""IMBUE"" no R and U eliminated.

Perhaps ""LYRE"" is 4 letters.

""PYRE"" 4.

""TYRE"" 4.

I think R at position 4 is harder. Let's consider ""OAKER"" not a word.

Another idea: ""LARGE"" but A eliminated.

""MERGE"" M-E-R-G-E — R at position 3, not 4.

""VERGE"" V-E-R-G-E — R at 3.

""DIRGE"" has R at 3.

So for now, let's go with ""DIRGE"" or ""HIREE"".

But in ""HIREE"", we have E at position 4, which might be redundant if the word has only one E, but we don't know.

We need to test new letters.

In ""DIRGE"", we have D, I, G, and E (but E is known).

In ""HIREE"", we have H, I, and E (twice).

We haven't tested I, D, G, H, etc.

Also, we need to avoid the eliminated letters.

Another word: ""BIRSE"" but S eliminated.

""FIRIE"" not a word.

Perhaps ""RIPED"" but ends with D.

I think ""DIRGE"" is a good choice: D-I-R-G-E.

- It has R in position 3, which is a possible position.
- It introduces new letters: D, I, G.
- Ends with E.

We can also consider ""WRIED"" but ends with D.

Or ""TRIED"" T eliminated.

So I think ""DIRGE"" is a reasonable guess.

But let's confirm the pattern: D(1), I(2), R(3), G(4), E(5). So R is at position 3, which is untried.

Similarly, we are testing I at position 2 and G at position 4.

We are not using any eliminated letters.

So, I'll go with ""DIRGE"".

But we have to be careful: if the word has only one E, and we put E at position 4, it might be marked as present or not, but in ""DIRGE"", position 4 is G, not E. Position 4 is G, position 5 is E.

In ""DIRGE"", the E is only at position 5, which is correct, so we don't test for additional E's.

In ""HIREE"", we have E at position 4 and 5, so if position 4 is not E, it might be marked as absent or present but wrong position.

But since we don't know, let's stick with ""DIRGE"".

Another word: ""BRIBE"" but R at position 2 forbidden.

""PRICE"" P-R-I-C-E — R at position 2 forbidden and C eliminated.

So, ""DIRGE"" it is.

But let's see if there's a word with R at position 4.

For example, ""ENDUE"" no R.

""UNDER"" ends with R, not E.

""OLDER"" O eliminated.

""ELDER"" E-L-D-E-R — ends with R, not E.

""UMBER"" U eliminated.

""AMBER"" A eliminated.

I think it's difficult, so ""DIRGE"" is fine.

Perhaps ""RIPEN"" but ends with N.

""GRIPE"" G-R-I-P-E — R at position 2 forbidden.

So, I think we should guess ""DIRGE"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crate"" → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) T(x) E(✓)**  
  - C, A, T are **absent** from the secret word.  
  - R is **present** but not in position 2.  
  - E is **correct** in position 5 (so the secret word ends with E).  

- **Guess 2: ""rouse"" → Feedback: R(-) O(x) U(x) S(x) E(✓)**  
  - R is **present** but not in position 1 (since it was marked ""-"" in position 1).  
  - O, U, S are **absent**.  
  - E is **correct** in position 5 (reconfirmed).  

### Key Deductions:
1. **Fixed Position**: Position 5 must be **E**.  
2. **R Position**: R is in the word but **not in position 1 or 2** (from feedback). Since position 5 is E, R must be in **position 3 or 4**.  
3. **Absent Letters**: C, A, T, O, U, S are eliminated. Avoid using these.  
4. **Strategy for Next Guess**:  
   - Must end with **E** (position 5).  
   - Must include **R in position 3 or 4** (to test its location).  
   - Use new, common letters to maximize information (e.g., I, D, G, L, N).  
   - Avoid repeating positions for R (positions 1 and 2 are invalid for R).  

### Choosing the Next Guess:
After evaluating possible words that fit the constraints (e.g., ending with E, R in position 3 or 4, no eliminated letters), **""dirge""** is a strong candidate:  
- **Structure**: D-I-R-G-E  
  - R is in **position 3** (untried position, testing if R is here).  
  - Ends with E (position 5 correct).  
- **New Letters**: Tests **D, I, G** (common letters not yet tried).  
- **Information Gain**:  
  - If R is marked ""✓"", it confirms position 3. If ""-"", R must be in position 4.  
  - Feedback on D, I, G will reveal if they are present/absent or in the correct positions.  

Other considered words (e.g., ""hiree"") were rejected due to redundancy (e.g., double E) or less common usage. ""Dirge"" is a valid 5-letter word meaning ""a lament for the dead,"" fitting the game's vocabulary.

We have no prior feedback. For the first guess, we want to choose a word that commonly contains vowels and common consonants to maximize the information we get from the feedback.\nCommon starting words in games like Wordle are words with multiple vowels and common letters. Examples include ""CRATE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ADIEU"", ""STARE"", etc.\nSince we don\'t know the secret word, we should pick a word that uses five distinct letters to cover more ground.\n\nI think ""CRATE"" is a good starting word because:\n- It contains two common vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (C, R, T).\n- All letters are distinct.\n\nSo, for the first guess, I will go with ""CRATE"".\n\nLet me output the guess accordingly.For the first guess, I\'ll choose a word that maximizes information gain by covering common vowels and consonants. ""CRATE"" is a strong starting word because it:\n- Includes 3 common consonants (C, R, T) and 2 vowels (A, E)\n- Has all distinct letters to optimize feedback coverage\n- Frequently appears in vocabulary games like Wordle as an effective opener\n\n<guess>crate</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crate -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) T(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are now on the second guess. The previous feedback for ""crate"" was:\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- A: t (x) (not in the word) -> Correction: the feedback shows A(x) meaning A is not present\n- T: x (not in the word)\n- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the last letter and is correct)\n\nSo, from feedback:\n- The secret word has an R, but not as the second letter (since in ""crate"", R was in position 2 and it\'s marked as wrong position).\n- The secret word has an E in the fifth position (since E was correct there).\n- Letters C, A, T are not in the word at all.\n\nTherefore, we know:\n- The word ends with E.\n- R is present somewhere but not in the second position. Possible positions for R: 1, 3, or 4 (since 2 is wrong and 5 is E).\n- We must avoid using C, A, T in the new guess.\n\nNow, we need to form a five-letter word that ends with E and includes an R (but not in position 2). Also, we want to test other common vowels and consonants to get more information.\n\nSince E is fixed at the end, let\'s brainstorm words ending with E that have R not in the second position.\n\nCommon consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, but excluding C, A, T.\n\nVowels we haven\'t checked: O, I, U (since A is out). We also know E is at the end, but there might be other E\'s? The feedback for E was only for position 5. We don\'t know if there are other E\'s, but since position 5 is E, and we have only one correct, we should consider that E might appear twice? But typically, we start without assuming duplicate letters unless feedback suggests.\n\nIn the first guess, we had E at the end and it was correct. But note, we don\'t know if E is present elsewhere because we only had one E. But since A is excluded, we might want to try another vowel.\n\nPossible vowels to test: O, I, U.\n\nWe also note that R is present, so we can place R at the beginning or in the middle.\n\nLet me try to think of words with R in position 1, 3, or 4 and E at the end.\n\nExamples:\n- If R is at position 1: words like R__ _ E. e.g., RUPEE, but that has two E\'s? \n- But we must avoid A, C, T.\n\nBetter to choose a word that uses new letters to maximize information.\n\nIdea: ""PROSE"" - but P, R, O, S, E. Let\'s check:\n- P is not excluded\n- R is included, and we can put R in position 1? In ""prose"", R is at position 2? Oh, no: P (1), R (2), O (3), S (4), E (5). But in this case, R is in the second position. We know from feedback that R is not in position 2? Wait, the feedback said R(-) meaning R is in the word but not in the second position? Correct! So if I put R in position 2 again, it will be wrong.\n\nTherefore, we cannot have R in position 2 for the new guess. So ""prose"" has R in position 2: not allowed.\n\nWe need a word where R is not in position 2 and E is at the end.\n\nAlternative: place R in position 1: e.g., ""ROUSE"" - R O U S E. \n- Positions: R(1), O(2), U(3), S(4), E(5)\n- But O is in position 2, which we haven\'t tested. Letter S is also new.\n\nThis might be a good choice? But let\'s confirm: we aren\'t using C, A, T. R is at position 1, which is good because we know R isn\'t at position 2, so trying at position 1 is new.\n\nAnother option: ""RINSE"" - R I N S E. R at position 1, I at position 2, etc.\n\nWe could try to include O to check for that vowel.\n\nBut note, we have not checked any O or I yet. So both ""ROUSE"" and ""RINSE"" are candidates.\n\nI think ""ROUSE"" might be better because we include O and U which are vowels we haven\'t checked.\n\nSo, guess: ROUSE.\n\nReasoning:\n- Ends with E: good.\n- Has R at position 1 (so not at position 2, which we know is wrong).\n- Uses new letters: O, U, S (which haven\'t been tried).\n- S wasn\'t in the first guess? We had C,R,A,T,E so S is new.\n\nBut wait, in the feedback, we know that R is in the word, but we don\'t know where. By placing it at position 1, we can test if R is at position 1 or not. If it\'s correct, great; if it\'s present but wrong position, then we know it must be at position 3 or 4.\n\nSimilarly, we are testing O, U, S.\n\nSo, ""ROUSE"" seems a good choice.\n\nThere\'s also ""RUBLE"" but B and L are also new? But E is at the end. However, ""ROUSE"" uses common letters.\n\nAnother word: ""PRIDE"" but P R I D E: R is at position 2? No, position 2 is R, which is not allowed because we know R is not in position 2 in the secret word? Wait, feedback said R(-) for position 2 meaning that R is in the word but not at position 2. So in a new guess, if we put R at position 2, it will again be marked as \'-\' since it\'s present but wrong position? But if R is actually at position 2, it would be marked as correct? But in reality, we know it\'s not at position 2, so placing at position 2 is wasteful because it will only get \'-\'.\n\nTherefore, to save positions and get better feedback, it\'s best to avoid putting R at position 2 again.\n\nSo ""PRIDE"" places R in position 2, which is not good.\n\nAvoid R in position 2.\n\nTherefore, ""ROUSE"" is a solid choice.\n\nLet me confirm spelling: ROUSE - it\'s a valid word meaning to stir or awaken.\n\nSo, I will guess ""ROUSE"".\n\nBut in the feedback, E was correct, so the word ends with E. We are respecting that.\n\nAlso, we are avoiding A, C, T.\n\nTherefore, guess: ROUSE.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crate"":\n- C, A, T are **not** in the secret word (indicated by ""x"").\n- R is in the secret word but **not** in the second position (indicated by ""-"").\n- E is in the secret word and in the **correct** fifth position (indicated by ""✓"").\n\nTherefore:\n- The secret word **ends with E**.\n- R **must appear** in position 1, 3, or 4 (since position 2 is incorrect).\n- New guess should **avoid C, A, T** and include R in an untried position (not position 2).\n- Prioritize testing common vowels/consonants not yet ruled out: O, U, S, I, etc.\n\nWith this in mind, ""ROUSE"" is a strategic guess:\n- Ends with E (respects the correct position).\n- Places R in position 1 (tests if R is in position 1).\n- Introduces new vowels O and U, and consonant S.\n- Avoids C, A, T.\n\n<guess>rouse</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crate -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) T(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: rouse -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) U(x) S(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are now on the third guess.

The word ends with E (position 5 is E and correct).\n2. R is in the word, but it is not in position 1 (from guess 2) and not in position 2 (from guess 1). Therefore, R must be in position 3 or 4 (since position 5 is E, so R cannot be there).\n3. The following letters are not in the word: C, A, T, O, U, S.\n\nWe also know that from guess 1, we had R in position 2 (wrong) and in guess 2, R in position 1 (wrong). So R must be in position 3 or 4.\n\nAdditionally, we have eliminated several common letters: C, A, T, O, U, S.\n\nNow, we need to form a 5-letter word that:\n- Ends with E (position 5)\n- Contains R in position 3 or 4\n- Does not contain C, A, T, O, U, S\n- Uses new letters to get more information\n\nAvailable letters: We have not used B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we need common ones.\n\nSince R must be in position 3 or 4, let\'s consider both cases.\n\nFirst, if R is in position 3: then the word is _ _ R _ E\n\nIf R is in position 4: then the word is _ _ _ R E\n\nWe need to test other common letters. We haven\'t tested I, L, N, D, etc.\n\nWe also need to avoid the eliminated letters.\n\nLet me think of words that fit.\n\nOption 1: R in position 3: _ _ R _ E\n\nPossible words: \n- BIRDE? Not a word. \n- DIRGE? D I R G E — that\'s a word (meaning a lament). \n- But we don\'t know if G is in the word.\n\nOption 2: R in position 4: _ _ _ R E\n\nPossible words:\n- LARGE? But A is eliminated, so no.\n- MIRRE? Not a word.\n- PIER? Only 4 letters.\n- We need 5 letters: e.g., ""PUREE"" but U is eliminated.\n\nAnother idea: ""WRIE"" is not 5 letters.\n\nLet\'s list possible words:\n\nFor R in position 3: \n- DIRGE: D I R G E\n- FIRED? But E is at the end, and we have E at position 5, but if we put E at position 5, then ""FIRED"" has E at 5 and also E at 4? No, ""FIRED"" is F-I-R-E-D, so E is at position 4, not 5. We need E at 5.\n\nSo for R in position 3: the pattern is _ _ R _ E\n\nExamples:\n- BIRLE? Not common.\n- GIRSE? Not a word.\n- HIREE? H I R E E — but that has two E\'s? H-I-R-E-E, so positions: 1:H, 2:I, 3:R, 4:E, 5:E — but position 4 is E and position 5 is E. But we know position 5 is E, but we don\'t know about position 4. However, ""HIREE"" is a word.\n\nBut we have eliminated S, but not H or I.\n\nSimilarly, ""DIRGE"" is D-I-R-G-E.\n\nAnother: ""WIRED"" but that ends with D, not E.\n\n""VIRED"" not a word.\n\n""JIVED"" but no R.\n\nSo let\'s consider R in position 4: _ _ _ R E\n\nExamples:\n- BORNE? But O is eliminated.\n- BIRSE? But S is eliminated and also not ending with E? BIRSE is B-I-R-S-E, so E at 5, but S is eliminated.\n- PIECE? But E at 5, but we have two E\'s? P-I-E-C-E, but C is eliminated.\n- So we need a word with pattern _ _ _ R E, without C,A,T,O,U,S.\n\nPossible words:\n- LIRE? 4 letters.\n- MIRE? 4 letters.\n- WIRE? 4 letters.\n- We need 5 letters: e.g., ""ADORE"" but A and O eliminated.\n- ""ELITE"" but no R and E at position 1? E-L-I-T-E, but T eliminated and no R.\n\nAnother idea: ""PRIDE"" but we have P-R-I-D-E, but R is at position 2? We know R cannot be at position 2. In ""PRIDE"", R is at position 2, which we must avoid.\n\nWe need R at position 3 or 4.\n\nBack to R at position 4: _ _ _ R E\n\nWhat about ""FJORD""? But ends with D, not E.\n\n""LYRE"" is 4 letters.\n\n""PYRE"" 4 letters.\n\n""TYRE"" 4 letters and T eliminated.\n\nPerhaps ""BRIBE""? B-R-I-B-E, but R is at position 2? We cannot have R at position 2. In ""BRIBE"", R is at position 2, which is forbidden.\n\nWe must avoid position 2 for R.\n\nSo for R at position 4, the word is _ _ _ R E.\n\nLet me search for words: \n- ""QUIRE"" but Q and U? U is eliminated.\n- ""INURE"" but U eliminated.\n- ""AWARE"" but A and W? A eliminated.\n\nPerhaps ""EMBER""? E-M-B-E-R — but E at position 1 and 4? And R at position 5? But we need R at position 4? Pattern: position 1: E, 2: M, 3: B, 4: E, 5: R — but we need E at position 5, not R. So no.\n\nWe need the last letter to be E.\n\nAnother word: ""OGRES"" but O and S eliminated.\n\n""EGRET"" but E at 1, G, R at 3, E at 4, T at 5 — but T eliminated and E at 5 is not, we have E at 5 must be, but here T is at 5.\n\nI\'m struggling. Let\'s think of common words ending with E that have R in position 3 or 4.\n\nPosition 3: _ _ R _ E\n- Examples: dire, but 4 letters; fire, 4; hire, 4; mire, 4; tire, 4; wire, 4.\n5-letter: shire, but S eliminated; spire, S; tired, T eliminated; wired, but ends with D? W-I-R-E-D, so D at 5, not E.\n\n""TRIBE"" but T and R at 2? T eliminated and R at position 2 forbidden.\n\n""GRIME"" G-R-I-M-E — R at position 2, forbidden.\n\n""PRIME"" P-R-I-M-E — R at position 2, forbidden.\n\n""DRIVE"" D-R-I-V-E — R at position 2, forbidden.\n\nIt seems many words have R at position 2. But we cannot use that.\n\nSo let\'s focus on R at position 3.\n\n_ _ R _ E\n\n5-letter words:\n- BIRLE: not common, but B-I-R-L-E\n- CIRCE: C eliminated\n- DIRGE: D-I-R-G-E — valid\n- FIRED: F-I-R-E-D — ends with D, not E\n- HIRED: H-I-R-E-D — ends with D\n- LIRNE: not a word\n- MIRED: M-I-R-E-D — ends with D\n- SIREN: S-I-R-E-N — but S eliminated, and ends with N? S-I-R-E-N, so E at 4, N at 5, not E at 5.\n- TIRED: T eliminated\n- WIRED: ends with D\n\nSo ""DIRGE"" is a candidate: D-I-R-G-E\n\nSimilarly, ""VIRGA"" not ending with E.\n\n""JIBE"" 4 letters.\n\nAnother word: ""HIREE"" — H-I-R-E-E, which is a word (meaning a person hired). So positions: 1:H, 2:I, 3:R, 4:E, 5:E\n\nThis has E at position 4 and 5. We know position 5 is E, but position 4 might be E or not. But in this case, we have E at 4, which is new.\n\nBut we can use ""HIREE"".\n\nSimilarly, ""DIVVE"" not a word.\n\n""KIRBE"" not a word.\n\nSo candidates: ""DIRGE"" and ""HIREE"".\n\nBut ""HIREE"" has two E\'s, which might be less common, but it\'s valid.\n\nWe also have the option of R at position 4.\n\nFor R at position 4: _ _ _ R E\n\nWords:\n- BORNE: O eliminated\n- CORNE: C and O eliminated\n- DARRE: not a word, A eliminated\n- FERME: not common, F-E-R-M-E? But R at position 3? F(1)E(2)R(3)M(4)E(5) — so R at 3, not 4.\n- GARRE: not a word\n- HERSE: H-E-R-S-E — but S eliminated, and R at position 3.\n- LERNE: not common\n- PERVE: not standard\n- TERRE: T eliminated\n- WERRE: not a word\n\n""AZURE"" but A and U eliminated.\n\n""EMBARK"" not ending with E.\n\n""IMBUE"" no R and U eliminated.\n\nPerhaps ""LYRE"" is 4 letters.\n\n""PYRE"" 4.\n\n""TYRE"" 4.\n\nI think R at position 4 is harder. Let\'s consider ""OAKER"" not a word.\n\nAnother idea: ""LARGE"" but A eliminated.\n\n""MERGE"" M-E-R-G-E — R at position 3, not 4.\n\n""VERGE"" V-E-R-G-E — R at 3.\n\n""DIRGE"" has R at 3.\n\nSo for now, let\'s go with ""DIRGE"" or ""HIREE"".\n\nBut in ""HIREE"", we have E at position 4, which might be redundant if the word has only one E, but we don\'t know.\n\nWe need to test new letters.\n\nIn ""DIRGE"", we have D, I, G, and E (but E is known).\n\nIn ""HIREE"", we have H, I, and E (twice).\n\nWe haven\'t tested I, D, G, H, etc.\n\nAlso, we need to avoid the eliminated letters.\n\nAnother word: ""BIRSE"" but S eliminated.\n\n""FIRIE"" not a word.\n\nPerhaps ""RIPED"" but ends with D.\n\nI think ""DIRGE"" is a good choice: D-I-R-G-E.\n\n- It has R in position 3, which is a possible position.\n- It introduces new letters: D, I, G.\n- Ends with E.\n\nWe can also consider ""WRIED"" but ends with D.\n\nOr ""TRIED"" T eliminated.\n\nSo I think ""DIRGE"" is a reasonable guess.\n\nBut let\'s confirm the pattern: D(1), I(2), R(3), G(4), E(5). So R is at position 3, which is untried.\n\nSimilarly, we are testing I at position 2 and G at position 4.\n\nWe are not using any eliminated letters.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""DIRGE"".\n\nBut we have to be careful: if the word has only one E, and we put E at position 4, it might be marked as present or not, but in ""DIRGE"", position 4 is G, not E. Position 4 is G, position 5 is E.\n\nIn ""DIRGE"", the E is only at position 5, which is correct, so we don\'t test for additional E\'s.\n\nIn ""HIREE"", we have E at position 4 and 5, so if position 4 is not E, it might be marked as absent or present but wrong position.\n\nBut since we don\'t know, let\'s stick with ""DIRGE"".\n\nAnother word: ""BRIBE"" but R at position 2 forbidden.\n\n""PRICE"" P-R-I-C-E — R at position 2 forbidden and C eliminated.\n\nSo, ""DIRGE"" it is.\n\nBut let\'s see if there\'s a word with R at position 4.\n\nFor example, ""ENDUE"" no R.\n\n""UNDER"" ends with R, not E.\n\n""OLDER"" O eliminated.\n\n""ELDER"" E-L-D-E-R — ends with R, not E.\n\n""UMBER"" U eliminated.\n\n""AMBER"" A eliminated.\n\nI think it\'s difficult, so ""DIRGE"" is fine.\n\nPerhaps ""RIPEN"" but ends with N.\n\n""GRIPE"" G-R-I-P-E — R at position 2 forbidden.\n\nSo, I think we should guess ""DIRGE"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n- **Guess 1: ""crate"" → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) T(x) E(✓)**  \n  - C, A, T are **absent** from the secret word.  \n  - R is **present** but not in position 2.  \n  - E is **correct** in position 5 (so the secret word ends with E).  \n\n- **Guess 2: ""rouse"" → Feedback: R(-) O(x) U(x) S(x) E(✓)**  \n  - R is **present** but not in position 1 (since it was marked ""-"" in position 1).  \n  - O, U, S are **absent**.  \n  - E is **correct** in position 5 (reconfirmed).  \n\n### Key Deductions:\n1. **Fixed Position**: Position 5 must be **E**.  \n2. **R Position**: R is in the word but **not in position 1 or 2** (from feedback).

If ""-"", R must be in position 4.  \n  - Feedback on D, I, G will reveal if they are present/absent or in the correct positions.  \n\nOther considered words (e.g., ""hiree"") were rejected due to redundancy (e.g., double E) or less common usage.

We are now on the fourth guess. Let's analyze the feedback from all previous guesses.

### Previous Feedback Summary:

**Guess 1: crate**
- C(x) → C not in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A(x) → A not in the word.
- T(x) → T not in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and correctly placed at position 5.

**Guess 2: rouse**
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 1 (since we placed R at position 1).
- O(x) → O not in the word.
- U(x) → U not in the word.
- S(x) → S not in the word.
- E(✓) → E confirmed at position 5.

**Guess 3: dirge**
- D(x) → D not in the word.
- I(x) → I not in the word.
- R(✓) → R is in the word and correctly placed at position 3. (This is crucial!)
- G(x) → G not in the word.
- E(✓) → E confirmed at position 5.

### Key Deductions:

1. **Confirmed Letters:**
   - **R** is at position 3 (from Guess 3: R(✓) at position 3).
   - **E** is at position 5 (reconfirmed).

2. **Absent Letters:**
   - C, A, T, O, U, S, D, I, G (all marked with ""x"" across guesses).

3. **Word Structure So Far:**
   - Position 3: R (fixed)
   - Position 5: E (fixed)
   - Positions 1, 2, and 4 are unknown but must avoid the absent letters.

   So the current pattern is: _ _ R _ E

4. **Letters Still Available:**
   - Given the absent letters, remaining consonants to try: B, F, H, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
   - Vowels: Only 'Y' remains as a possible vowel (since A, E, I, O, U are either used or eliminated; E is fixed at the end but cannot be used elsewhere? Not necessarily—we don't know if E appears elsewhere). Note:
        - E is fixed at position 5, but it could appear again earlier? However, since we have no feedback about another E, it might not be duplicated. But we can't assume yet.

   Note: E has only been confirmed at position 5, so it might appear elsewhere. However, in the guesses so far, we haven't placed E in other positions (in ""dirge"", E was only at position 5). So we don't have data on other Es.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- We need to fill positions 1, 2, and 4 with letters not yet eliminated.
- Since we have limited guesses left (3 tries remaining), choose a word that tests plausible letters and fits common English patterns.
- Position 4 must be a letter that can precede E (since it's the second-to-last letter). Common letters include L, N, and possibly others.
- Test high-frequency consonants: L, N, H, M, etc.

### Possible Word Candidates:
- Pattern: _ _ R ? E
  - Ending with ""R_E"" is common; the ? can be one of the available letters.

Some examples (avoiding absent letters: D, G, I, etc.):
- **BERET**: B E R E T → But E is at position 2 and 4. However, T is eliminated (from guess 1).
- **FERME**: Not standard English.
- **HER**? Words ending with ""RE"":
- **HERE**: H E R E → But we have four letters? No, ""HERE"" is 4 letters. We need 5-letter words.
- **BERME**: Not common and T?.
- **NERVE**: N E R V E → But V is available? However, E at position 2 and 4? Let's see:
  - N at 1? E at 2? But we haven't confirmed E elsewhere.
- But we must avoid putting E at position 2 if we can? Because we might get misleading feedback. But it's acceptable if we want to test for duplicate E.

Other ideas:
- **PERVE**: Not common.
- **MERLE**: M E R L E → But L is available? This has E at position 2 and 5? Pattern: M(1) E(2) R(3) L(4) E(5). But position 5 is E, which is fixed. Position 2 is E? If we place E at position 2, it might be present or not. However, we know E at 5 is fixed, but we don't know about other E's.
- Similarly, ""BERET"" was invalid because of T.

Another approach: Avoid duplicate E unless necessary. So try words without E in positions 1-2-4.

Possible words:
- **PARKA**: Ends with A, not E.
- **BURLY**: No E ending.
- Focus on words ending with ""..R_E"":
  - Examples: **FARCE** → but C and A eliminated? A and C absent.
  - **LARGE** → A absent.
  - **MARRED** → 6 letters? Wait, 5: M A R R E? M(1) A(2) R(3) R(4) E(5) — ""MARRED"" is 6 letters? No, ""MARRE"" not a word.
- Actually, valid words with pattern _ _ R ? E (where ? is any letter not eliminated):

  Potential letter for position 4: Must be consonant? Or vowel? Position 4 is before E, so it's often a consonant (like L, V, N) or occasionally a vowel?

  Possible words:
  - With position 4 as L: **PEARL?** But ends with L, not E. No, pattern: we need ... E at end? No, the pattern is _ _ R ? E, so position 4 is the fourth letter, then position 5 is E. So for position 4, if we put L, the word must have L at position 4 and E at 5.

  Examples:
  - **CARLE**: But C and A eliminated.
  - **HARLE**: H A R L E → A eliminated.
  - So with L: **PERLE**? Not common; **MERLE** M E R L E → This is valid? But E at position 2 — and let's spell: M-E-R-L-E. So in ""MERLE"", position 1: M, position 2: E, position 3: R, position 4: L, position 5: E.

  But:
  - Position 5: E (correct)
  - Position 3: R (correct)
  - Position 2: E — we don't know if the word has another E. But if we use this, we can test if E is at position 2.

  Similarly, with N: **TERNE** T eliminated; **BERNE** B E R N E → E at position 2? B(1)E(2)R(3)N(4)E(5). But B is available? ""BERNE"" is a proper noun? Maybe, but let's stick to common words.

  Another: **HERON** Ends with N, not E? Wrong pattern.

  How about **VERGE**? But V-E-R-G-E, but G eliminated in guess 3.

  Another: **NERVE**: N E R V E → Positions: 1:N, 2:E, 3:R, 4:V, 5:E.

  This avoids all eliminated letters? Eliminated letters: C,A,T,O,U,S,D,I,G. V is not eliminated, and N is not eliminated.

  So ""NERVE"":
  - N at position 1: new letter
  - E at position 2: tests for E elsewhere
  - R at position 3: fixed and correct
  - V at position 4: new letter
  - E at position 5: fixed

  Feedback potential:
  - If position 2 E is marked ""✓"", we know E is duplicated at position 2.
  - If marked ""-"", E is elsewhere or not duplicated? But if marked ""x"", then no other E.

  Similarly, V at position 4.

  Alternative: **MERGE**? But G eliminated.

  **PERVE** is informal.

  **KERNE**: K E R N E → Similarly, K at position 1, E at 2, R at 3, N at 4, E at 5.

  Available letters? K and N not eliminated.

  But ""KERNE"" might be archaic.

  Another word: **VERSE**? But S eliminated.

  **FERME** not accepted.

After evaluation, **""NERVE""** is a strong candidate:
- Uses common letters N and V (both not tested).
- Tests for E in position 2.
- Respects fixed R at position 3 and E at position 5.

Other options might be less common, so ""NERVE"" is preferred.

But note: We are testing E at position 2. If the word doesn't have E at position 2, we'll get feedback that helps us restrict more.

Alternatively, if we avoid putting E at position 2, we might get clearer consonant feedback. But it’s a trade-off.

Another word without E at position 2: **CURVE**? U eliminated; **BARGE** A eliminated.

**PURSE**? U and S eliminated.

**LYRE**? 4 letters.

Maybe **YIRTH**? Not ending with E.

Consider **MYRRH**? Not E-ending.

Probably not many options without E elsewhere. So guessing ""NERVE"" is reasonable.

### Decision:
Guess ""NERVE"" to cover:
- Testing N and V (new letters).
- Checking if E is duplicated at position 2.

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crate"" feedback (C(x) R(-) A(x) T(x) E(✓))**:  
  - Absent letters: **C, A, T**.  
  - **R** is present (but not in position 2), and **E** is fixed at position 5.  

- **Guess 2: ""rouse"" feedback (R(-) O(x) U(x) S(x) E(✓))**:  
  - Absent letters: **O, U, S**.  
  - **R** is present but not in position 1 (reaffirming it must be in position 3/4).  
  - **E** reconfirmed at position 5.  

- **Guess 3: ""dirge"" feedback (D(x) I(x) R(✓) G(x) E(✓))**:  
  - Absent letters: **D, I, G**.  
  - **R** is fixed at position 3 (major clue!).  
  - **E** reconfirmed at position 5.  

### Key Deductions:
1. **Fixed positions**:  
   - Position 3 = **R**  
   - Position 5 = **E**  
   Secret word pattern: `_ _ R _ E`.  

2. **Eliminated letters (absent)**:  
   **C, A, T, O, U, S, D, I, G** (9 letters).  

3. **Available letters**:  
   Remaining consonants: B, F, H, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
   Vowels: Only **Y** remains (A, I, O, U eliminated; E is fixed at the end but might appear elsewhere).  

4. **Strategy for Guess 4**:  
   - Fill positions 1, 2, and 4 with untested letters to maximize information.  
   - Avoid reused letters (all guesses so far had unique letters).  
   - Prioritize high-frequency letters: **B, H, L, M, N, P**.  
   - Position 4 interfaces with fixed `R_E`, so likely a consonant (e.g., L, N, V).  
   - Test for potential duplicate E (if E appears earlier in the word), though not confirmed.  

### Selected Guess: ""NERVE""
- **Structure**: N E R V E  
  - Position 1: **N** (new, untested).  
  - Position 2: **E** (tests if E appears elsewhere; if marked ""✓"" or ""-"" confirms duplication, if ""x"" rules it out).  
  - Position 3: **R** (fixed correct).  
  - Position 4: **V** (new, untested consonant).  
  - Position 5: **E** (fixed correct).  
- **Why ""NERVE""?**  
  - Uses high-frequency letters (N, V) and tests E duplication.  
  - Fits pattern `_ _ R _ E` and avoids all eliminated letters.  
  - Maximizes feedback: Positions 1, 2, and 4 will clarify the missing letters.

  - **E** reconfirmed at position 5.  

- **Guess 3: ""dirge"" feedback (D(x) I(x) R(✓) G(x) E(✓))**:  
  - Absent letters: **D, I, G**.  
  - **R** is fixed at position 3 (major clue!).  
  - **E** reconfirmed at position 5.  

### Key Deductions:
1. **Fixed positions**:  
   - Position 3 = **R**  
   - Position 5 = **E**  
   Secret word pattern: `_ _ R _ E`.  

2. **Eliminated letters (absent)**:  
   **C, A, T, O, U, S, D, I, G** (9 letters).  

3. **Available letters**:  
   Remaining consonants: B, F, H, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
   Vowels: Only **Y** remains (A, I, O, U eliminated; E is fixed at the end but might appear elsewhere).  

4. **Strategy for Guess 4**:  
   - Fill positions 1, 2, and 4 with untested letters to maximize information.  
   - Avoid reused letters (all guesses so far had unique letters).  
   - Prioritize high-frequency letters: **B, H, L, M, N, P**.  
   - Position 4 interfaces with fixed `R_E`, so likely a consonant (e.g., L, N, V).  
   - Test for potential duplicate E (if E appears earlier in the word), though not confirmed.  

### Selected Guess: ""NERVE""
- **Structure**: N E R V E  
  - Position 1: **N** (new, untested).  
  - Position 2: **E** (tests if E appears elsewhere; if marked ""✓"" or ""-"" confirms duplication, if ""x"" rules it out).  
  - Position 3: **R** (fixed correct).  
  - Position 4: **V** (new, untested consonant).  
  - Position 5: **E** (fixed correct).  
- **Why ""NERVE""?**  
  - Uses high-frequency letters (N, V) and tests E duplication.  
  - Fits pattern `_ _ R _ E` and avoids all eliminated letters.  
  - Maximizes feedback: Positions 1, 2, and 4 will clarify the missing letters.",Guess 4: nerve -> FEEDBACK: N(✓) E(✓) R(✓) V(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
