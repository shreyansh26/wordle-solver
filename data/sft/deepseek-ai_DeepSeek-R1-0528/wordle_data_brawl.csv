We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x -> not in the secret word
 R: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (so the secret word has R in the second position)
 A: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (so A is in the third position)
 N: x -> not in the secret word
 E: x -> not in the secret word

 So we know:
 Position 2: R
 Position 3: A
 The letters C, N, E are not in the word at all.

 The secret word has 5 letters: _ R A _ _

 We don't know the first, fourth, and fifth letters.

 We must avoid using C, N, E.

 We also know that the word contains at least R and A (already fixed in positions 2 and 3).

 Now, we want to guess a word that fits the pattern _ R A _ _ and does not contain C, N, E.

 We also want to test new letters to get more information.

 Let's think of common 5-letter words with R in the second position and A in the third.

 Some examples: 
   GRABS, TRACK, DRAMA, GRAPE, TRADE, BRAVE, etc.

 However, we must avoid letters we know are not in the word: C, N, E.

 In our feedback, E is not in the word, so we avoid E.

 Let's look for words that don't have C, N, E.

 Possible candidates: 
   GRABS: G, R, A, B, S -> pattern: G R A B S. We don't know if G, B, S are in the word.
   TRACK: T, R, A, C, K -> but C is not allowed (we know C is not in the word).
   DRAMA: D, R, A, M, A -> two A's. But we know A is in the word, but does the word have two A's? We don't know. We only know about the third position A. However, we can try DRAMA? But note: the word might have another A.

 But wait, our feedback for ""crane"" told us that A is in the correct position and we don't know about other A's.

 We must also remember that the secret word might have repeated letters? But the feedback symbols don't tell us about multiple occurrences. However, for now, let's avoid assuming duplicates.

 Since we have two fixed letters, we can try a word that uses other common letters not yet tested.

 We have already ruled out C, N, E. So let's try to cover more consonants.

 Let me think of words that match _ R A _ _ without C, N, E.

 Common letters we haven't tested: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want to maximize information, so we pick a word with totally new letters and at the same time may fit.

 We can try ""BRAVE"": B R A V E -> but E is not allowed? Not allowed because E is not in the secret word.

 Another: ""TRADE"" -> T R A D E -> E is not allowed.

 Similarly, ""GRAPE"" -> E is not allowed.

 So avoid words with E.

 Another: ""PARTY"": P R A T Y -> pattern would be P R A T. But wait, the pattern is _ R A _ _ so the fourth and fifth are unknown. So ""PARTY"" would be: P (1), R (2), A (3), T (4), Y (5). 

 But does the secret word have E? We know E is absent, so avoid E.

 Also, we cannot use C, N, E.

 So let's list a few possibilities without E, C, N:

 - BRASH: B R A S H -> letters: B, S, H (and R, A already known)
 - GRASP: G R A S P -> letters: G, S, P
 - DRABS: D R A B S -> but it's not very common, and we are testing for humans.
 - FRATS: F R A T S -> but FRATS might not be common.
 - DRAWL: D R A W L -> W and L.

 However, we don't know if the secret word has any of these. Also, we know that R is fixed at position 2 and A at position 3.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that tests common letters for positions 1,4,5.

 Let me think: 
   Position 1: could be a consonant from B, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, R, S, T, W, etc.
   Position 4: same possibilities (but note: must avoid repeating letters that are already in the word? but we don't know)

 Since we are limited, and we want to test multiple letters, let's try ""PARTY"":

 Why ""PARTY""? 
   - P is a new letter for position 1.
   - T and Y are new for positions 4 and 5.

 But note: we already know A and R, so in the word ""PARTY"", A is in position 3 (which we know is correct) and R in position 2 (correct). We are testing P, T, and Y.

 Also, it doesn't contain C, E, N.

 So let's guess ""PARTY"".

 However, wait: in the word ""PARTY"", the R and A are in the correct positions? 

 Yes: 
   Position 1: P
   Position 2: R (correct)
   Position 3: A (correct)
   Position 4: T
   Position 5: Y

 This fits the pattern.

 But let's confirm: we want to use letters we haven't tried? So far we have only tried: C, R, A, N, E.

 Now we are adding P, T, Y.

 This seems good.

 Alternatively, we can try ""BRAWL"": B R A W L -> same pattern: B in 1, R in 2, A in 3, W in 4, L in 5. Letters: B, W, L.

 Both are valid. But ""PARTY"" might be more common.

 Considering maximizing information, we might choose a word that has high-frequency letters.

 Frequency: 
   P is common, T is very common, Y is less common.
   B is common, W and L are common.

 Another candidate: ""GRAPY"" isn't a word? So not.

 Another common word: ""TRAMP"": T R A M P -> letters T, M, P. Position 1: T, 4: M, 5: P.

 But note: if we use ""TRAMP"", then position 1 is T and position 5 is P.

 We might also consider ""TRAPS"": T R A P S -> positions: T(1), R(2), A(3), P(4), S(5). This tests T, P, and S.

 Since we have only tried 5 letters (C,R,A,N,E) and we are adding three new letters, any of these would be fine.

 Let me choose ""TRAPS"". But wait, we already used R and A? Yes, but they are fixed so we can reuse? Actually, we must reuse them because they are known to be in the word.

 But note: the feedback rules: we are allowed to use letters that are not in the word? But we know R and A are in the word and in specific positions. So we should use R in the second and A in the third.

 The important thing is to test the unknown positions.

 ""PARTY"" and ""TRAPS"" are both good.

 Let's compare:
   ""PARTY"": P, T, Y
   ""TRAPS"": T, P, S

 Which one tests letters with higher frequency? 

 In English, S is more common than Y. Also, T and P are both common.

 So ""TRAPS"" might be better: we test S which is a common consonant.

 Therefore, let's choose ""TRAPS"".

 Now, write the guess.

 Guess: ""TRAPS""

 However, note that when we guess ""TRAPS"", the letters are:
   T (position1), R (position2), A (position3), P (position4), S (position5).

 We hope to get feedback on T, P, and S.

 But note: we already know R and A are correct and present, so we expect:
   Position2: ✓
   Position3: ✓

 The others: we are testing T at position1, P at position4, and S at position5.

 We also know that the secret word does not contain C, N, E.

 So, let's go with ""TRAPS"".

<guess>traps</guess>
</think>
Based on the previous feedback for ""crane"" where:
- C, N, and E are **absent** from the secret word
- R is **correct** in position 2
- A is **correct** in position 3

The secret word pattern is: `_ R A _ _`

For the next guess:
- Must be a 5-letter English word fitting `_ R A _ _`
- Cannot reuse absent letters (C, N, E)
- Prioritize testing new common letters in unknown positions (1, 4, 5)
- ""traps"" (T in position 1, P in position 4, S in position 5) maximizes new high-frequency letters

<guess>traps</guess>",traps,"We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x -> not in the secret word
 R: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (so the secret word has R in the second position)
 A: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (so A is in the third position)
 N: x -> not in the secret word
 E: x -> not in the secret word

 So we know:
 Position 2: R
 Position 3: A
 The letters C, N, E are not in the word at all.

 The secret word has 5 letters: _ R A _ _

 We don't know the first, fourth, and fifth letters.

 We must avoid using C, N, E.

 We also know that the word contains at least R and A (already fixed in positions 2 and 3).

 Now, we want to guess a word that fits the pattern _ R A _ _ and does not contain C, N, E.

 We also want to test new letters to get more information.

 Let's think of common 5-letter words with R in the second position and A in the third.

 Some examples: 
   GRABS, TRACK, DRAMA, GRAPE, TRADE, BRAVE, etc.

 However, we must avoid letters we know are not in the word: C, N, E.

 In our feedback, E is not in the word, so we avoid E.

 Let's look for words that don't have C, N, E.

 Possible candidates: 
   GRABS: G, R, A, B, S -> pattern: G R A B S. We don't know if G, B, S are in the word.
   TRACK: T, R, A, C, K -> but C is not allowed (we know C is not in the word).
   DRAMA: D, R, A, M, A -> two A's. But we know A is in the word, but does the word have two A's? We don't know. We only know about the third position A. However, we can try DRAMA? But note: the word might have another A.

 But wait, our feedback for ""crane"" told us that A is in the correct position and we don't know about other A's.

 We must also remember that the secret word might have repeated letters? But the feedback symbols don't tell us about multiple occurrences. However, for now, let's avoid assuming duplicates.

 Since we have two fixed letters, we can try a word that uses other common letters not yet tested.

 We have already ruled out C, N, E. So let's try to cover more consonants.

 Let me think of words that match _ R A _ _ without C, N, E.

 Common letters we haven't tested: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want to maximize information, so we pick a word with totally new letters and at the same time may fit.

 We can try ""BRAVE"": B R A V E -> but E is not allowed? Not allowed because E is not in the secret word.

 Another: ""TRADE"" -> T R A D E -> E is not allowed.

 Similarly, ""GRAPE"" -> E is not allowed.

 So avoid words with E.

 Another: ""PARTY"": P R A T Y -> pattern would be P R A T. But wait, the pattern is _ R A _ _ so the fourth and fifth are unknown. So ""PARTY"" would be: P (1), R (2), A (3), T (4), Y (5). 

 But does the secret word have E? We know E is absent, so avoid E.

 Also, we cannot use C, N, E.

 So let's list a few possibilities without E, C, N:

 - BRASH: B R A S H -> letters: B, S, H (and R, A already known)
 - GRASP: G R A S P -> letters: G, S, P
 - DRABS: D R A B S -> but it's not very common, and we are testing for humans.
 - FRATS: F R A T S -> but FRATS might not be common.
 - DRAWL: D R A W L -> W and L.

 However, we don't know if the secret word has any of these. Also, we know that R is fixed at position 2 and A at position 3.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that tests common letters for positions 1,4,5.

 Let me think: 
   Position 1: could be a consonant from B, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, R, S, T, W, etc.
   Position 4: same possibilities (but note: must avoid repeating letters that are already in the word? but we don't know)

 Since we are limited, and we want to test multiple letters, let's try ""PARTY"":

 Why ""PARTY""? 
   - P is a new letter for position 1.
   - T and Y are new for positions 4 and 5.

 But note: we already know A and R, so in the word ""PARTY"", A is in position 3 (which we know is correct) and R in position 2 (correct). We are testing P, T, and Y.

 Also, it doesn't contain C, E, N.

 So let's guess ""PARTY"".

 However, wait: in the word ""PARTY"", the R and A are in the correct positions? 

 Yes: 
   Position 1: P
   Position 2: R (correct)
   Position 3: A (correct)
   Position 4: T
   Position 5: Y

 This fits the pattern.

 But let's confirm: we want to use letters we haven't tried? So far we have only tried: C, R, A, N, E.

 Now we are adding P, T, Y.

 This seems good.

 Alternatively, we can try ""BRAWL"": B R A W L -> same pattern: B in 1, R in 2, A in 3, W in 4, L in 5. Letters: B, W, L.

 Both are valid. But ""PARTY"" might be more common.

 Considering maximizing information, we might choose a word that has high-frequency letters.

 Frequency: 
   P is common, T is very common, Y is less common.
   B is common, W and L are common.

 Another candidate: ""GRAPY"" isn't a word? So not.

 Another common word: ""TRAMP"": T R A M P -> letters T, M, P. Position 1: T, 4: M, 5: P.

 But note: if we use ""TRAMP"", then position 1 is T and position 5 is P.

 We might also consider ""TRAPS"": T R A P S -> positions: T(1), R(2), A(3), P(4), S(5). This tests T, P, and S.

 Since we have only tried 5 letters (C,R,A,N,E) and we are adding three new letters, any of these would be fine.

 Let me choose ""TRAPS"". But wait, we already used R and A? Yes, but they are fixed so we can reuse? Actually, we must reuse them because they are known to be in the word.

 But note: the feedback rules: we are allowed to use letters that are not in the word? But we know R and A are in the word and in specific positions. So we should use R in the second and A in the third.

 The important thing is to test the unknown positions.

 ""PARTY"" and ""TRAPS"" are both good.

 Let's compare:
   ""PARTY"": P, T, Y
   ""TRAPS"": T, P, S

 Which one tests letters with higher frequency? 

 In English, S is more common than Y. Also, T and P are both common.

 So ""TRAPS"" might be better: we test S which is a common consonant.

 Therefore, let's choose ""TRAPS"".

 Now, write the guess.

 Guess: ""TRAPS""

 However, note that when we guess ""TRAPS"", the letters are:
   T (position1), R (position2), A (position3), P (position4), S (position5).

 We hope to get feedback on T, P, and S.

 But note: we already know R and A are correct and present, so we expect:
   Position2: ✓
   Position3: ✓

 However, we don't know if the secret word has any of these. Also, we know that R is fixed at position 2 and A at position 3.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that tests common letters for positions 1,4,5.

 Let me think: 
   Position 1: could be a consonant from B, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, R, S, T, W, etc.
   Position 4: same possibilities (but note: must avoid repeating letters that are already in the word? but we don't know)

 Since we are limited, and we want to test multiple letters, let's try ""PARTY"":

 Why ""PARTY""? 
   - P is a new letter for position 1.
   - T and Y are new for positions 4 and 5.

 But note: we already know A and R, so in the word ""PARTY"", A is in position 3 (which we know is correct) and R in position 2 (correct). We are testing P, T, and Y.

 Also, it doesn't contain C, E, N.

 So let's guess ""PARTY"".

 However, wait: in the word ""PARTY"", the R and A are in the correct positions? 

 Yes: 
   Position 1: P
   Position 2: R (correct)
   Position 3: A (correct)
   Position 4: T
   Position 5: Y

 This fits the pattern.

 But let's confirm: we want to use letters we haven't tried? So far we have only tried: C, R, A, N, E.

 Now we are adding P, T, Y.

 This seems good.

 Alternatively, we can try ""BRAWL"": B R A W L -> same pattern: B in 1, R in 2, A in 3, W in 4, L in 5. Letters: B, W, L.

 Both are valid. But ""PARTY"" might be more common.

 Considering maximizing information, we might choose a word that has high-frequency letters.

 Frequency: 
   P is common, T is very common, Y is less common.
   B is common, W and L are common.

 Another candidate: ""GRAPY"" isn't a word? So not.

 Another common word: ""TRAMP"": T R A M P -> letters T, M, P. Position 1: T, 4: M, 5: P.

 But note: if we use ""TRAMP"", then position 1 is T and position 5 is P.

 We might also consider ""TRAPS"": T R A P S -> positions: T(1), R(2), A(3), P(4), S(5). This tests T, P, and S.

 Since we have only tried 5 letters (C,R,A,N,E) and we are adding three new letters, any of these would be fine.

 Let me choose ""TRAPS"". But wait, we already used R and A? Yes, but they are fixed so we can reuse? Actually, we must reuse them because they are known to be in the word.

 But note: the feedback rules: we are allowed to use letters that are not in the word? But we know R and A are in the word and in specific positions. So we should use R in the second and A in the third.

 The important thing is to test the unknown positions.

 ""PARTY"" and ""TRAPS"" are both good.

 Let's compare:
   ""PARTY"": P, T, Y
   ""TRAPS"": T, P, S

 Which one tests letters with higher frequency? 

 In English, S is more common than Y. Also, T and P are both common.

 So ""TRAPS"" might be better: we test S which is a common consonant.

 Therefore, let's choose ""TRAPS"".

 Now, write the guess.

 Guess: ""TRAPS""

 However, note that when we guess ""TRAPS"", the letters are:
   T (position1), R (position2), A (position3), P (position4), S (position5).

 We hope to get feedback on T, P, and S.

 But note: we already know R and A are correct and present, so we expect:
   Position2: ✓
   Position3: ✓

 The others: we are testing T at position1, P at position4, and S at position5.

 We also know that the secret word does not contain C, N, E.

 So, let's go with ""TRAPS"".

<guess>traps</guess>Based on the previous feedback for ""crane"" where:
- C, N, and E are **absent** from the secret word
- R is **correct** in position 2
- A is **correct** in position 3

The secret word pattern is: `_ R A _ _`

For the next guess:
- Must be a 5-letter English word fitting `_ R A _ _`
- Cannot reuse absent letters (C, N, E)
- Prioritize testing new common letters in unknown positions (1, 4, 5)
- ""traps"" (T in position 1, P in position 4, S in position 5) maximizes new high-frequency letters

We are given feedback from two guesses:

First guess: crane -> C(x), R(✓), A(✓), N(x), E(x)
This tells us:
- R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- C, N, E are not in the word at all.

Second guess: traps -> T(x), R(✓), A(✓), P(x), S(x)
So:
- R (position 2) is correct -> already knew.
- A (position 3) is correct -> already knew.
- T, P, S are not in the word.

Therefore, we can update our knowledge:
Secret word: second letter is R, third letter is A. So pattern: _ R A _ _
Additionally, the following letters are ABSENT: C, E, N, T, P, S.

We know the word is of the form: [Letter1] R A [Letter4] [Letter5]

Letter1, Letter4, Letter5 are unknown, but they cannot be any of the absent letters: C, E, N, T, P, S.

We also note that we don't have any other information.

Now, we must guess a new word that fits the pattern and avoids the absent letters.

The word must be _ R A _ _ and use letters from the remaining alphabet excluding C, E, N, T, P, S.

What letters are left?
Alphabet: A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,R,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Remove absent letters: C, E, N, T, P, S -> remove these.

So remaining letters: A, B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note:
- A and R are already in the word, but we don't know if they appear again? Our feedback doesn't tell us about multiple occurrences. However, we know A is at position 3 and R is at position 2. For other positions, we don't know.

We should avoid using any of the absent letters.

Now, let's think of words that fit _ R A _ _

Possible words:

Consider common words:

- BRAWL: B R A W L -> letters: B (new), W (new), L (new). Checks positions: 1=B, 4=W, 5=L.
- DRAWL: D R A W L -> D, W, L.
- GRAVY: G R A V Y -> G, V, Y.
- DRAIN: But N is absent -> invalid.
- FRAUD: F R A U D -> F, U, D. (but D is a letter)
- GRAND: N is absent -> invalid.
- BRAND: N absent -> invalid.

We must avoid any word that has C, E, N, T, P, S.

Also, we might prefer words that use common letters to maximize information.

Possible options:

1. BRAWL: B, R, A, W, L -> tests B, W, L.
2. DRAWL: D, R, A, W, L -> tests D, W, L.
3. GRAVY: G, R, A, V, Y -> tests G, V, Y.
4. FRAUD: F, R, A, U, D -> tests F, U, D.
5. GRAIL: G, R, A, I, L -> tests G, I, L.
6. BRAID: B, R, A, I, D -> tests B, I, D.

Note: We don't know if any of these are the word. We are still guessing.

We want to maximize information: we should choose a word that covers multiple common letters we haven't tried.

We have already tried: C, R, A, N, E, T, P, S.

Now, common letters like B, D, G, L, M, O, U, V, W, etc.

Let's see frequency in English: B is common, D is common, G, L, etc.

But note: we only have 3 new letters to test per guess? Because positions 2 and 3 are fixed.

So any guess will test exactly three new letters (for positions 1,4,5).

We can choose any. Let's pick ""BRAWL"" because it uses B (common), W and L.

Another common word: ""BRAVE""? But E is absent -> invalid.

""GRAM"" -> too short.

""GRAB"": too short.

5-letter words must.

""KRAUT"" -> has T -> invalid.

""FRAIL"": F R A I L -> F, I, L.

But we haven't tried F, I, L.

Similarly, ""BRAIL"" isn't common? Probably not.

Let me check standard Wordle words: we want a valid word.

""BRAWL"" is valid.

Anyway, let me try to think systematically.

We have: 
Letters tested and absent: C, E, N, T, P, S.
Letters tested and present: R (position2), A (position3).

We are missing information about other letters.

We can also note that the word might contain additional A or R? But we don't know.

In the absence of any yellow feedback, each of the absent letters is totally absent.

So our candidate must be from the remaining letters.

How about ""BRAID""?

But we haven't tried I? Let's avoid if possible? We don't know.

Actually, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another word: ""BORAX""? But O is new? But ""BORAX"" is a word: B, O, R, A, X -> but note pattern: B would be position1, then R at position3? But our pattern is _ R A _ _, so position2 must be R and position3 A.

In ""BORAX"": 
  B (1), O (2) -> but O is at position2? Wait, no: the word is B-O-R-A-X? Actually, spelling is B-O-R-A-X -> so positions: 
  1: B
  2: O -> but we require position2 to be R? 
  -> No! The word must have R in position2? So ""BORAX"" does not work because the second letter is O, not R.

Our pattern must have R in the second position and A in the third.

So the word must be: 
  Position1: any letter (from the remaining)
  Position2: R
  Position3: A
  Position4: any letter (remaining)
  Position5: any letter (remaining)

So ""BORAX"" doesn't fit.

Similarly, ""GRAVY"": G, R, A, V, Y -> fits: G(1), R(2), A(3), V(4), Y(5). Valid.

Similarly, ""BRAVO"": B, R, A, V, O -> also valid: B(1), R(2), A(3), V(4), O(5).

But we note that in ""BRAVO"", O is the last letter.

We haven't tested B, V, O.

We might consider between ""BRAWL"" and ""BRAVO"".

Let's choose ""BRAVO"" because it has a vowel (O) which might be important? Or not.

But we are not required, just testing.

Alternatively, ""DRAWL"": D, R, A, W, L -> D(1), W(4), L(5).

All are new.

I think any is acceptable.

Let me pick ""GRAVY"" because it has V and Y, which are less common and might help eliminate if they occur.

But to be systematic, let's note:

We have limited remaining tries, so we want to make a guess that has the potential to be correct, but also informative.

Since we don't know, let's choose a common word.

Common words with the pattern: 
  BRAWL, DRAW, but DRAW is only 4 letters? No, 5 letter: we need 5 letters.

BRAWL, FRAUD, GRAND (but GRAND has N -> invalid), GRAB (4 letters), so BRAWL is acceptable.

Another common word: ""BREAD""? But E is absent -> invalid.

So ""BRAWL"" is a good choice.

But let me see: ""BRAIL"" is a word? According to dictionary, brail is a noun meaning small rope? But maybe not common.

Similarly, ""FLAIR"": F L A I R -> positions are not matching: F(1), L(2) -> but we require R at 2? No: R would be at the end? Not fixed at position2.

We must have R at position2.

So let's go with ""BRAWL"".

But in ""BRAWL"": 
  B - position1
  R - position2 (correct)
  A - position3 (correct)
  W - position4
  L - position5

We test B, W, L.

If this is correct, we win.

If not, we get feedback on B, W, L.

Alternatively, we might consider ""GRAVY"" to test G, V, Y.

But I think ""BRAWL"" is fine.

Another word: ""DRAMA"" -> D R A M A. 
Position1: D, position4: M, position5: A.

So the letters are D, M, and A (again). We already know A is in the word, but we test if there's a second A? Also, we test D and M.

This is also valid. But note: we know A is present already? But if the word has two A's? We don't know.

But ""DRAMA"" has A at position5? And we know A is also at position3? Then we have two A's? Possible.

But we don't know if the absence of other A's? We have not tested A in any other position.

Also, feedback for ""crane"" only told us about one A? Actually, no: the feedback only indicates per letter in the guess. In ""crane"", we had A at position3 which was green. There could be another A elsewhere? We don't know.

Similarly, with ""traps"", we tested S at the end? But S was absent? So we know no other A? No, we tested S at position5? Not A.

So ""DRAMA"" is a valid guess: D(1), R(2), A(3), M(4), A(5). 

Now, if we guess ""DRAMA"", we test whether there is an A at position5? Also we test D and M.

But we have limited information about multiple A's? But the feedback might tell us.

It's acceptable.

Also, note: in terms of letter frequency, we might avoid repeating A? Because we don't know? But it tests D and M.

But compare to ""BRAWL"": tests three distinct new letters? Yes.

With ""DRAMA"", we test D and M and also the possibility of a second A.

I think it's better to avoid repeating letters we know might be there? Because we might get a green and still not know about the fourth letter? Not necessarily. But without information.

Let's calculate: we have only 4 guesses left? We've used 2, so 4 remaining.

I think either is fine.

But I'll choose ""BRAWL"" because it tests three entirely new letters.

So guess: ""BRAWL""

Now, write in the format.

Based on previous feedback:
- Absent letters: C, E, N, T, P, S

For the next guess:
- Must be a valid 5-letter word fitting _ R A _ _ 
- Avoid absent letters (C, E, N, T, P, S)
- ""brawl"" fits the pattern: B at position 1, R at 2, A at 3, W at 4, L at 5

We also note that we don't have any other information.

Now, we must guess a new word that fits the pattern and avoids the absent letters.

The word must be _ R A _ _ and use letters from the remaining alphabet excluding C, E, N, T, P, S.

What letters are left?
Alphabet: A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,R,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Remove absent letters: C, E, N, T, P, S -> remove these.

So remaining letters: A, B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note:
- A and R are already in the word, but we don't know if they appear again? Our feedback doesn't tell us about multiple occurrences. However, we know A is at position 3 and R is at position 2. For other positions, we don't know.

We should avoid using any of the absent letters.

Now, let's think of words that fit _ R A _ _

Possible words:

Consider common words:

We must avoid any word that has C, E, N, T, P, S.

Also, we might prefer words that use common letters to maximize information.

Possible options:

1. BRAWL: B, R, A, W, L -> tests B, W, L.
2. DRAWL: D, R, A, W, L -> tests D, W, L.
3. GRAVY: G, R, A, V, Y -> tests G, V, Y.
4. FRAUD: F, R, A, U, D -> tests F, U, D.
5. GRAIL: G, R, A, I, L -> tests G, I, L.
6. BRAID: B, R, A, I, D -> tests B, I, D.

Note: We don't know if any of these are the word. We are still guessing.

We want to maximize information: we should choose a word that covers multiple common letters we haven't tried.

We have already tried: C, R, A, N, E, T, P, S.

Now, common letters like B, D, G, L, M, O, U, V, W, etc.

Let's see frequency in English: B is common, D is common, G, L, etc.

But note: we only have 3 new letters to test per guess? Because positions 2 and 3 are fixed.

So any guess will test exactly three new letters (for positions 1,4,5).

We can choose any. Let's pick ""BRAWL"" because it uses B (common), W and L.

Another common word: ""BRAVE""? But E is absent -> invalid.

""GRAM"" -> too short.

""GRAB"": too short.

5-letter words must.

""KRAUT"" -> has T -> invalid.

""FRAIL"": F R A I L -> F, I, L.

But we haven't tried F, I, L.

Similarly, ""BRAIL"" isn't common? Probably not.

Let me check standard Wordle words: we want a valid word.

""BRAWL"" is valid.

Anyway, let me try to think systematically.

We have: 
Letters tested and absent: C, E, N, T, P, S.
Letters tested and present: R (position2), A (position3).

We are missing information about other letters.

We can also note that the word might contain additional A or R? But we don't know.

In the absence of any yellow feedback, each of the absent letters is totally absent.

So our candidate must be from the remaining letters.

How about ""BRAID""?

But we haven't tried I? Let's avoid if possible? We don't know.

Actually, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another word: ""BORAX""? But O is new? But ""BORAX"" is a word: B, O, R, A, X -> but note pattern: B would be position1, then R at position3? But our pattern is _ R A _ _, so position2 must be R and position3 A.

In ""BORAX"": 
  B (1), O (2) -> but O is at position2? Wait, no: the word is B-O-R-A-X? Actually, spelling is B-O-R-A-X -> so positions: 
  1: B
  2: O -> but we require position2 to be R? 
  -> No! The word must have R in position2? So ""BORAX"" does not work because the second letter is O, not R.

Our pattern must have R in the second position and A in the third.

So the word must be: 
  Position1: any letter (from the remaining)
  Position2: R
  Position3: A
  Position4: any letter (remaining)
  Position5: any letter (remaining)

So ""BORAX"" doesn't fit.

Similarly, ""GRAVY"": G, R, A, V, Y -> fits: G(1), R(2), A(3), V(4), Y(5). Valid.

Similarly, ""BRAVO"": B, R, A, V, O -> also valid: B(1), R(2), A(3), V(4), O(5).

But we note that in ""BRAVO"", O is the last letter.

We haven't tested B, V, O.

We might consider between ""BRAWL"" and ""BRAVO"".

Let's choose ""BRAVO"" because it has a vowel (O) which might be important? Or not.

But we are not required, just testing.

Alternatively, ""DRAWL"": D, R, A, W, L -> D(1), W(4), L(5).

All are new.

I think any is acceptable.

Let me pick ""GRAVY"" because it has V and Y, which are less common and might help eliminate if they occur.

But to be systematic, let's note:

We have limited remaining tries, so we want to make a guess that has the potential to be correct, but also informative.

Since we don't know, let's choose a common word.

Common words with the pattern: 
  BRAWL, DRAW, but DRAW is only 4 letters? No, 5 letter: we need 5 letters.

BRAWL, FRAUD, GRAND (but GRAND has N -> invalid), GRAB (4 letters), so BRAWL is acceptable.

Another common word: ""BREAD""? But E is absent -> invalid.

So ""BRAWL"" is a good choice.

But let me see: ""BRAIL"" is a word? According to dictionary, brail is a noun meaning small rope? But maybe not common.

Similarly, ""FLAIR"": F L A I R -> positions are not matching: F(1), L(2) -> but we require R at 2? No: R would be at the end? Not fixed at position2.

We must have R at position2.

So let's go with ""BRAWL"".

But in ""BRAWL"": 
  B - position1
  R - position2 (correct)
  A - position3 (correct)
  W - position4
  L - position5

We test B, W, L.

If this is correct, we win.

If not, we get feedback on B, W, L.

Alternatively, we might consider ""GRAVY"" to test G, V, Y.

But I think ""BRAWL"" is fine.

Another word: ""DRAMA"" -> D R A M A. 
Position1: D, position4: M, position5: A.

So the letters are D, M, and A (again). We already know A is in the word, but we test if there's a second A? Also, we test D and M.

This is also valid. But note: we know A is present already? But if the word has two A's? We don't know.

But ""DRAMA"" has A at position5? And we know A is also at position3? Then we have two A's? Possible.

But we don't know if the absence of other A's? We have not tested A in any other position.

Also, feedback for ""crane"" only told us about one A? Actually, no: the feedback only indicates per letter in the guess. In ""crane"", we had A at position3 which was green. There could be another A elsewhere? We don't know.

Similarly, with ""traps"", we tested S at the end? But S was absent? So we know no other A? No, we tested S at position5? Not A.

So ""DRAMA"" is a valid guess: D(1), R(2), A(3), M(4), A(5). 

Now, if we guess ""DRAMA"", we test whether there is an A at position5? Also we test D and M.

But we have limited information about multiple A's? But the feedback might tell us.

It's acceptable.

Also, note: in terms of letter frequency, we might avoid repeating A? Because we don't know? But it tests D and M.

But compare to ""BRAWL"": tests three distinct new letters? Yes.

With ""DRAMA"", we test D and M and also the possibility of a second A.

I think it's better to avoid repeating letters we know might be there? Because we might get a green and still not know about the fourth letter? Not necessarily. But without information.

Let's calculate: we have only 4 guesses left? We've used 2, so 4 remaining.

I think either is fine.

But I'll choose ""BRAWL"" because it tests three entirely new letters.

So guess: ""BRAWL""

Now, write in the format.

<guess>brawl</guess>Based on previous feedback:
- Absent letters: C, E, N, T, P, S
- Correct positions: Position 2 = R, Position 3 = A
- Secret word pattern: _ R A _ _

For the next guess:
- Must be a valid 5-letter word fitting _ R A _ _ 
- Avoid absent letters (C, E, N, T, P, S)
- ""brawl"" fits the pattern: B at position 1, R at 2, A at 3, W at 4, L at 5
- Tests new common letters B, W, L in unknown positions",Guess 3: brawl -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) R(✓) A(✓) W(✓) L(✓),SUCCESS
