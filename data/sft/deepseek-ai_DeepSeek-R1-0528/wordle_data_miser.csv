We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The letters C, A, N are not in the secret word.
 - The letter R is in the word, but not in the second position (since we guessed it in the second position and it was marked as wrong position).
 - The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position.

 Also, note that the secret word must contain R and E, and does not contain C, A, N.

 Since R is in the word but not in position 2, and E is in the word but not in position 5, we can try to form a new guess.

 We have to avoid using C, A, N.

 Let's think of a word that includes R and E, and also uses other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

 We have already used: C, R, A, N, E.

 We can try to use other common consonants and vowels. Common letters include: S, T, L, O, U, D, G, H, I, etc.

 We know R must be in the word, but not at position 2. So R can be at positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: in the feedback, we had R at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So R is in the word but not at position 2.

 Similarly, E is in the word but not at position 5.

 We also know that the word does not have C, A, N.

 Let's try to think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N.

 We can try a word that puts R in a different position and E in a different position.

 For example, we might try to put R at position 1 and E at position 3? Or other positions.

 But note: we don't know the exact positions yet.

 We can also consider that the word might have other common letters.

 Let's try the word ""ROLES"" as a possibility? But wait, we have to avoid A, C, N, and we haven't used O, L, S.

 However, note that in the feedback, we have R and E present. But we must also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? The rules don't say anything about duplicate letters, but typically in Wordle, words can have duplicates. However, the feedback for ""crane"" didn't show any duplicate, so we don't have evidence of duplicates yet.

 But let's check: if we use ""ROLES"":
 - R at position 1: if the secret word has R at position 1, then it would be marked as correct (✓). But in our feedback, R was in the word but not at position 2, so it could be at position 1? Actually, yes, it could be at position 1.

 However, we don't know if R is at position 1 or not. So we can try a word that has R in a position we haven't tried and E in a position we haven't tried.

 Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has as many new letters as possible to get more information.

 Let me think of a word that includes R and E, and uses three new letters.

 Some possibilities: 
 - ""RICES"" -> but C is not allowed (we know C is not in the word) and also we have C in the word which is already known to be absent? So we cannot use C.

 We must avoid C, A, N.

 So let's try: ""ROUTE"", ""RISES"", ""ROBES"", ""RULES"", ""RIPES"", ""ROGUE"", etc.

 But note: we also want to test other common letters. Let's try to include S, T, L, etc.

 Another idea: we can try ""STORE"". But let's check:
 - S: new
 - T: new
 - O: new
 - R: we know it's in the word, but we are putting it at position 4? 
 - E: we know it's in the word, but we are putting it at position 5? But wait, in the first guess, E was at position 5 and was marked as wrong position. So E cannot be at position 5. Therefore, we cannot put E at position 5 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not at position 5. So we should avoid putting E at position 5.

 Therefore, we should avoid putting E at the fifth position and R at the second position.

 So for ""STORE"": 
 - R is at position 4 -> that's a new position for R, so it might be correct or not.
 - E is at position 5 -> but we know E is not at position 5, so it would be marked as present but wrong position again? We don't get new information about E's position? Actually, we would get that E is not at position 5 (which we already know) and we don't learn about other positions.

 So we should try to put E in a different position, say position 2, 3, or 4.

 Similarly, R should be in a position that is not 2. We can try position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Let me try to form a word that has R at position 1 and E at position 3? For example: ""RESTY"" (if we allow Y). But we need to make sure it's a valid word.

 Alternatively, ""RESET"" has duplicate E? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. We should avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.

 How about ""ROBES""? 
 - R at 1, O at 2, B at 3, E at 4, S at 5.
 But note: we are putting E at position 4? That's a new position. And R at position 1? That's a new position.

 However, we have to avoid using letters we know are absent: C, A, N. ""ROBES"" uses R, O, B, E, S. None of these are C, A, N. So it's okay.

 But wait: what if the secret word has O? We don't know. We are testing O and B and S.

 Alternatively, we can try ""RIPEN"" but N is not allowed. So we cannot use N.

 Another word: ""RIPED""? Not a word. ""RIPES"" is a word? Yes, meaning to tear or pull.

 ""RIPES"": 
 - R at 1, I at 2, P at 3, E at 4, S at 5.

 This avoids the forbidden letters and puts R at a new position (1) and E at a new position (4). Also, we test I, P, S.

 But note: in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was present but wrong. So if we put R at position 1, and if the secret word has R at position 1, we'll get a ✓. If not, then we'll get a - (if R is elsewhere) or x (if R is not at 1) but we know R is in the word so it would be - if not at 1.

 Similarly, E at position 4: if the secret word has E at position 4, we get ✓, else we get - (since we know E is in the word).

 However, we are also testing I at position 2 and P at position 3 and S at position 5.

 But wait: we know that the secret word does not have A, C, N. So we are safe.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in the middle? 

 Another common word: ""DRIVE"" -> but D is new, R at position 2? We cannot put R at position 2 because we already know that position 2 is not R. So we should avoid position 2 for R? Actually, we can put R at position 2 again? But we know it's not there, so it would be marked as present but wrong position again? That doesn't give new information. So we should avoid putting R at position 2.

 Therefore, ""DRIVE"" is not good because R is at position 2.

 How about ""DRUPE""? (a kind of fruit) -> R at position 3? and E at position 5? But we know E is not at position 5. So we avoid E at 5.

 Let me think of a word that has E at position 3: for example, ""CRWTH"" is not common and has C. Avoid.

 Another: ""TREES"" -> duplicate E? and E at position 5? Avoid.

 How about ""STREP""? 
 - S at 1, T at 2, R at 3, E at 4, P at 5.
 This puts R at position 3 (new) and E at position 4 (new). And we test S, T, P.

 But note: we are putting R at position 3 and E at position 4. Also, we avoid forbidden letters.

 However, we are using 5 new letters: S, T, R, E, P. But we already know R and E are in the word, so we are testing S, T, P.

 This seems good.

 But wait: we are not using the fact that we can put R at position 1? We might get more information by trying R at position 1.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROUSE"": 
 - R at 1, O at 2, U at 3, S at 4, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is not allowed? We know E is not at 5, so we avoid.

 How about ""ROUSE"" is not good because of E at 5.

 Then let me try ""ROBES"" again: 
 - R at 1, O at 2, B at 3, E at 4, S at 5 -> E at 4? That's good.

 But we are putting E at 4, which is a new position.

 Alternatively, ""RULES"": 
 - R at 1, U at 2, L at 3, E at 4, S at 5 -> same as above, E at 4.

 But we are testing U and L.

 I think ""RULES"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters and we haven't tried U and L.

 However, we might also consider ""ROUTE"": 
 - R at 1, O at 2, U at 3, T at 4, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is not allowed.

 So we avoid.

 Another word: ""RIPES"" (as I thought earlier) or ""RISES"" (but S at 5? and we have two S's? ""RISES"" has two S's? Actually, it's R-I-S-E-S -> so two S's? That might not be ideal because we are testing fewer letters.

 We want to test as many new letters as possible. So words with 5 distinct letters are better.

 ""RIPES"" has distinct letters: R, I, P, E, S.

 So does ""RULES"": R, U, L, E, S.

 Both are good.

 But note: we already know R and E are in the word, so we are testing I, P, S in ""RIPES"" and U, L, S in ""RULES"".

 Since we have limited tries, we want to maximize the chance of hitting the correct letters and also get position information.

 I think I'll go with ""RIPES"" because it uses I and P which are common.

 But let me check: we have to avoid A, C, N. So ""RIPES"" is safe.

 So my second guess: ""RIPES""

 We'll see:
 - If R is at position 1: we get ✓ or - (if not at 1, but we know it's in the word so it would be -)
 - I at position 2: we don't know, so we get feedback.
 - P at position 3: feedback.
 - E at position 4: if E is at 4, we get ✓, else - (because E is in the word)
 - S at position 5: feedback.

 This will give us more information.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't put R at the beginning? But we don't know where R is. We are trying to find the position.

 But we have to try R in a new position. We tried position 2 (in ""crane"") and now we try position 1. We can also try position 3, 4, or 5 in future guesses.

 So I think ""RIPES"" is a good guess.

 Let me write it: R I P E S

 But wait: what if the secret word has R at position 1? Then we get a ✓ and we know the first letter. That would be great.

 If not, then we know R is not at position 1 and we can try other positions.

 So I'll go with ""RIPES"".

After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, A, N** are **not** in the secret word.
- **R** is in the word but **not in position 2**.
- **E** is in the word but **not in position 5**.

For the next guess:
- Avoid **C, A, N** entirely.
- Include **R** and **E**, but place them in new positions (not position 2 for R, not position 5 for E).
- Test new common letters (**I, P, S**) to gather more information.
- Prioritize distinct letters to maximize coverage.

The word **""RIPES""** fits these criteria:
- Places **R** at position 1 (new position, could be correct or reveal another location).
- Places **E** at position 4 (new position, avoids position 5).
- Tests **I** (position 2), **P** (position 3), and **S** (position 5) for the first time.
- Uses no forbidden letters (C, A, N) and no duplicates.

This guess will efficiently narrow down possible positions for R and E while checking three new letters.

 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The letters C, A, N are not in the secret word.
 - The letter R is in the word, but not in the second position (since we guessed it in the second position and it was marked as wrong position).
 - The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position.

 But note: we already know R and E are in the word, so we are testing I, P, S in ""RIPES"" and U, L, S in ""RULES"".

 Since we have limited tries, we want to maximize the chance of hitting the correct letters and also get position information.

 I think I'll go with ""RIPES"" because it uses I and P which are common.

 But let me check: we have to avoid A, C, N. So ""RIPES"" is safe.

 So my second guess: ""RIPES""

 We'll see:
 - If R is at position 1: we get ✓ or - (if not at 1, but we know it's in the word so it would be -)
 - I at position 2: we don't know, so we get feedback.
 - P at position 3: feedback.
 - E at position 4: if E is at 4, we get ✓, else - (because E is in the word)
 - S at position 5: feedback.

 This will give us more information.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't put R at the beginning? But we don't know where R is. We are trying to find the position.

 But we have to try R in a new position. We tried position 2 (in ""crane"") and now we try position 1. We can also try position 3, 4, or 5 in future guesses.

 So I think ""RIPES"" is a good guess.

 Let me write it: R I P E S

 But wait: what if the secret word has R at position 1? Then we get a ✓ and we know the first letter. That would be great.

 If not, then we know R is not at position 1 and we can try other positions.

 So I'll go with ""RIPES"".

<guess>ripes</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, A, N** are **not** in the secret word.
- **R** is in the word but **not in position 2**.
- **E** is in the word but **not in position 5**.

For the next guess:
- Avoid **C, A, N** entirely.
- Include **R** and **E**, but place them in new positions (not position 2 for R, not position 5 for E).
- Test new common letters (**I, P, S**) to gather more information.
- Prioritize distinct letters to maximize coverage.

The word **""RIPES""** fits these criteria:
- Places **R** at position 1 (new position, could be correct or reveal another location).
- Places **E** at position 4 (new position, avoids position 5).
- Tests **I** (position 2), **P** (position 3), and **S** (position 5) for the first time.
- Uses no forbidden letters (C, A, N) and no duplicates.

This guess will efficiently narrow down possible positions for R and E while checking three new letters.",Guess 2: ripes -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(✓) P(x) E(✓) S(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,miser,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The letters C, A, N are not in the secret word.
 - The letter R is in the word, but not in the second position (since we guessed it in the second position and it was marked as wrong position).
 - The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position.

 Also, note that the secret word must contain R and E, and does not contain C, A, N.

 Since R is in the word but not in position 2, and E is in the word but not in position 5, we can try to form a new guess.

 We have to avoid using C, A, N.

 Let's think of a word that includes R and E, and also uses other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

 We have already used: C, R, A, N, E.

 We can try to use other common consonants and vowels. Common letters include: S, T, L, O, U, D, G, H, I, etc.

 We know R must be in the word, but not at position 2. So R can be at positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: in the feedback, we had R at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So R is in the word but not at position 2.

 Similarly, E is in the word but not at position 5.

 We also know that the word does not have C, A, N.

 Let's try to think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N.

 We can try a word that puts R in a different position and E in a different position.

 For example, we might try to put R at position 1 and E at position 3? Or other positions.

 But note: we don't know the exact positions yet.

 We can also consider that the word might have other common letters.

 Let's try the word ""ROLES"" as a possibility? But wait, we have to avoid A, C, N, and we haven't used O, L, S.

 However, note that in the feedback, we have R and E present. But we must also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? The rules don't say anything about duplicate letters, but typically in Wordle, words can have duplicates. However, the feedback for ""crane"" didn't show any duplicate, so we don't have evidence of duplicates yet.

 But let's check: if we use ""ROLES"":
 - R at position 1: if the secret word has R at position 1, then it would be marked as correct (✓). But in our feedback, R was in the word but not at position 2, so it could be at position 1? Actually, yes, it could be at position 1.

 However, we don't know if R is at position 1 or not. So we can try a word that has R in a position we haven't tried and E in a position we haven't tried.

 Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has as many new letters as possible to get more information.

 Let me think of a word that includes R and E, and uses three new letters.

 Some possibilities: 
 - ""RICES"" -> but C is not allowed (we know C is not in the word) and also we have C in the word which is already known to be absent? So we cannot use C.

 We must avoid C, A, N.

 So let's try: ""ROUTE"", ""RISES"", ""ROBES"", ""RULES"", ""RIPES"", ""ROGUE"", etc.

 But note: we also want to test other common letters. Let's try to include S, T, L, etc.

 Another idea: we can try ""STORE"". But let's check:
 - S: new
 - T: new
 - O: new
 - R: we know it's in the word, but we are putting it at position 4? 
 - E: we know it's in the word, but we are putting it at position 5? But wait, in the first guess, E was at position 5 and was marked as wrong position. So E cannot be at position 5. Therefore, we cannot put E at position 5 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not at position 5. So we should avoid putting E at position 5.

 Therefore, we should avoid putting E at the fifth position and R at the second position.

 So for ""STORE"": 
 - R is at position 4 -> that's a new position for R, so it might be correct or not.
 - E is at position 5 -> but we know E is not at position 5, so it would be marked as present but wrong position again? We don't get new information about E's position? Actually, we would get that E is not at position 5 (which we already know) and we don't learn about other positions.

 So we should try to put E in a different position, say position 2, 3, or 4.

 Similarly, R should be in a position that is not 2. We can try position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Let me try to form a word that has R at position 1 and E at position 3? For example: ""RESTY"" (if we allow Y). But we need to make sure it's a valid word.

 Alternatively, ""RESET"" has duplicate E? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. We should avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.

 How about ""ROBES""? 
 - R at 1, O at 2, B at 3, E at 4, S at 5.
 But note: we are putting E at position 4? That's a new position. And R at position 1? That's a new position.

 However, we have to avoid using letters we know are absent: C, A, N. ""ROBES"" uses R, O, B, E, S. None of these are C, A, N. So it's okay.

 But wait: what if the secret word has O? We don't know. We are testing O and B and S.

 Alternatively, we can try ""RIPEN"" but N is not allowed. So we cannot use N.

 Another word: ""RIPED""? Not a word. ""RIPES"" is a word? Yes, meaning to tear or pull.

 ""RIPES"": 
 - R at 1, I at 2, P at 3, E at 4, S at 5.

 This avoids the forbidden letters and puts R at a new position (1) and E at a new position (4). Also, we test I, P, S.

 But note: in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was present but wrong. So if we put R at position 1, and if the secret word has R at position 1, we'll get a ✓. If not, then we'll get a - (if R is elsewhere) or x (if R is not at 1) but we know R is in the word so it would be - if not at 1.

 Similarly, E at position 4: if the secret word has E at position 4, we get ✓, else we get - (since we know E is in the word).

 However, we are also testing I at position 2 and P at position 3 and S at position 5.

 But wait: we know that the secret word does not have A, C, N. So we are safe.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in the middle? 

 Another common word: ""DRIVE"" -> but D is new, R at position 2? We cannot put R at position 2 because we already know that position 2 is not R. So we should avoid position 2 for R? Actually, we can put R at position 2 again? But we know it's not there, so it would be marked as present but wrong position again? That doesn't give new information. So we should avoid putting R at position 2.

 Therefore, ""DRIVE"" is not good because R is at position 2.

 How about ""DRUPE""? (a kind of fruit) -> R at position 3? and E at position 5? But we know E is not at position 5. So we avoid E at 5.

 Let me think of a word that has E at position 3: for example, ""CRWTH"" is not common and has C. Avoid.

 Another: ""TREES"" -> duplicate E? and E at position 5? Avoid.

 How about ""STREP""? 
 - S at 1, T at 2, R at 3, E at 4, P at 5.
 This puts R at position 3 (new) and E at position 4 (new). And we test S, T, P.

 But note: we are putting R at position 3 and E at position 4. Also, we avoid forbidden letters.

 However, we are using 5 new letters: S, T, R, E, P. But we already know R and E are in the word, so we are testing S, T, P.

 This seems good.

 But wait: we are not using the fact that we can put R at position 1? We might get more information by trying R at position 1.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROUSE"": 
 - R at 1, O at 2, U at 3, S at 4, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is not allowed? We know E is not at 5, so we avoid.

 How about ""ROUSE"" is not good because of E at 5.

 Then let me try ""ROBES"" again: 
 - R at 1, O at 2, B at 3, E at 4, S at 5 -> E at 4? That's good.

 But we are putting E at 4, which is a new position.

 Alternatively, ""RULES"": 
 - R at 1, U at 2, L at 3, E at 4, S at 5 -> same as above, E at 4.

 But we are testing U and L.

 I think ""RULES"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters and we haven't tried U and L.

 However, we might also consider ""ROUTE"": 
 - R at 1, O at 2, U at 3, T at 4, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is not allowed.

 So we avoid.

 Another word: ""RIPES"" (as I thought earlier) or ""RISES"" (but S at 5? and we have two S's? ""RISES"" has two S's? Actually, it's R-I-S-E-S -> so two S's? That might not be ideal because we are testing fewer letters.

 We want to test as many new letters as possible. So words with 5 distinct letters are better.

 ""RIPES"" has distinct letters: R, I, P, E, S.

 So does ""RULES"": R, U, L, E, S.

 Both are good.

 But note: we already know R and E are in the word, so we are testing I, P, S in ""RIPES"" and U, L, S in ""RULES"".

 Since we have limited tries, we want to maximize the chance of hitting the correct letters and also get position information.

 I think I'll go with ""RIPES"" because it uses I and P which are common.

 But let me check: we have to avoid A, C, N. So ""RIPES"" is safe.

 So my second guess: ""RIPES""

 We'll see:
 - If R is at position 1: we get ✓ or - (if not at 1, but we know it's in the word so it would be -)
 - I at position 2: we don't know, so we get feedback.
 - P at position 3: feedback.
 - E at position 4: if E is at 4, we get ✓, else - (because E is in the word)
 - S at position 5: feedback.

 This will give us more information.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't put R at the beginning? But we don't know where R is. We are trying to find the position.

 But we have to try R in a new position. We tried position 2 (in ""crane"") and now we try position 1. We can also try position 3, 4, or 5 in future guesses.

 So I think ""RIPES"" is a good guess.

 Let me write it: R I P E S

 But wait: what if the secret word has R at position 1? Then we get a ✓ and we know the first letter. That would be great.

 If not, then we know R is not at position 1 and we can try other positions.

 So I'll go with ""RIPES"".

<guess>ripes</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, A, N** are **not** in the secret word.
- **R** is in the word but **not in position 2**.
- **E** is in the word but **not in position 5**.

For the next guess:
- Avoid **C, A, N** entirely.
- Include **R** and **E**, but place them in new positions (not position 2 for R, not position 5 for E).
- Test new common letters (**I, P, S**) to gather more information.
- Prioritize distinct letters to maximize coverage.

The word **""RIPES""** fits these criteria:

- Tests **I** (position 2), **P** (position 3), and **S** (position 5) for the first time.
- Uses no forbidden letters (C, A, N) and no duplicates.

This guess will efficiently narrow down possible positions for R and E while checking three new letters.

So words with 5 distinct letters are better.\n\n ""RIPES"" has distinct letters: R, I, P, E, S.\n\n So does ""RULES"": R, U, L, E, S.\n\n Both are good.\n\n But note: we already know R and E are in the word, so we are testing I, P, S in ""RIPES"" and U, L, S in ""RULES"".\n\n Since we have limited tries, we want to maximize the chance of hitting the correct letters and also get position information.\n\n I think I\'ll go with ""RIPES"" because it uses I and P which are common.\n\n But let me check: we have to avoid A, C, N. So ""RIPES"" is safe.\n\n So my second guess: ""RIPES""\n\n We\'ll see:\n - If R is at position 1: we get ✓ or - (if not at 1, but we know it\'s in the word so it would be -)\n - I at position 2: we don\'t know, so we get feedback.\n - P at position 3: feedback.\n - E at position 4: if E is at 4, we get ✓, else - (because E is in the word)\n - S at position 5: feedback.\n\n This will give us more information.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t put R at the beginning? But we don\'t know where R is. We are trying to find the position.\n\n But we have to try R in a new position. We tried position 2 (in ""crane"") and now we try position 1. We can also try position 3, 4, or 5 in future guesses.\n\n So I think ""RIPES"" is a good guess.\n\n Let me write it: R I P E S\n\n But wait: what if the secret word has R at position 1? Then we get a ✓ and we know the first letter. That would be great.\n\n If not, then we know R is not at position 1 and we can try other positions.\n\n So I\'ll go with ""RIPES"".\n\n<guess>ripes</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C, A, N** are **not** in the secret word.\n- **R** is in the word but **not in position 2**.\n- **E** is in the word but **not in position 5**.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Avoid **C, A, N** entirely.\n- Include **R** and **E**, but place them in new positions (not position 2 for R, not position 5 for E).\n- Test new common letters (**I, P, S**) to gather more information.\n- Prioritize distinct letters to maximize coverage.\n\nThe word **""RIPES""** fits these criteria:\n- Places **R** at position 1 (new position, could be correct or reveal another location).\n- Places **E** at position 4 (new position, avoids position 5).\n- Tests **I** (position 2), **P** (position 3), and **S** (position 5) for the first time.\n- Uses no forbidden letters (C, A, N) and no duplicates.\n\nThis guess will efficiently narrow down possible positions for R and E while checking three new letters.\n\n<guess>ripes</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: ripes -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(✓) P(x) E(✓) S(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but wrong position)

Second guess: ""ripes""
- R: - (in the word, but wrong position) -> note: in ""ripes"", R is at position 1, so the secret word has R but not at position 1.
- I: ✓ (correct letter and position) -> so position 2 is I.
- P: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct letter and position) -> so position 4 is E.
- S: - (in the word, but wrong position) -> so S is in the word, but not at position 5.

We now know:
- The secret word has: R, I (at position 2), E (at position 4), and S (but not at position 5). Also, from the first guess, we know E is in the word (now confirmed at position 4) and R is in the word (but not at position 1 or 2).
- Letters not in the word: C, A, N, P (and from ""crane"": C, A, N; from ""ripes"": P). Also, from ""crane"", we had E not at 5, which is consistent because now E is at 4.

The current known positions:
- Position 2: I (fixed)
- Position 4: E (fixed)

We also have:
- R is in the word, but not at position 1 (from ""ripes"") and not at position 2 (from ""crane"", and position 2 is I). So R must be at position 3 or 5? Because position 4 is E, so R can be at 3 or 5? Or at position 1? But we just guessed R at position 1 and it was wrong position, so R is not at 1. Similarly, not at 2. So positions available: 3 or 5? But note: positions are 1 to 5. We haven't tried position 3 or 5 for R.

But wait: the word might have more than five letters? No, it's a 5-letter word. So R must be at one of the other positions: 3 or 5? But position 4 is E, so R can be at 3 or 5? Yes.

Also, S is in the word but not at position 5 (from ""ripes"" feedback). So S can be at position 1 or 3? Because positions: 1, 2(I), 3, 4(E), 5. And S cannot be at position 5. Also, we don't know where S is exactly.

We also know that R must be at position 3 or 5, and S must be at position 1 or 3? But if R is at 3 and S at 3, that's impossible. So S can only be at position 1 (if R is at 3 or 5) or at position 3 only if R is not at 3? But R cannot be at S's position. So:

- If R is at position 3, then S must be at position 1 (since position 5 is open but S cannot be at 5? Wait: no, position 5 is available for S? But in the feedback for ""ripes"", S was at position 5 and marked as wrong position? So S cannot be at 5. Therefore, S can only be at position 1 or 3.

But if R is at position 3, then S cannot be at 3 (same position). So then S must be at 1.

If R is at position 5, then S could be at position 1 or 3.

So we have two main cases:

Case 1: R at 3, then S must be at 1.
Case 2: R at 5, then S can be at 1 or 3.

Additionally, we have one more letter to determine: the letter at position 5 in Case 1 is unknown? Or position 3 in Case 2? 

The word structure:
- Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 -> known: 2=I, 4=E.
- Letters: R and S are in the word, and one more letter because we have 5 letters: we have R, I, E, S, and one more unknown letter that hasn't been guessed yet.

We have used: from ""crane"": C,R,A,N,E -> so we know C,A,N are out; from ""ripes"": R,I,P,E,S -> P is out.

So the unknown letter must be a letter that hasn't been guessed: we have guessed letters: C, R, A, N, E, I, P, S.

So we have tried: C, R, A, N, E, I, P, S.

Therefore, the secret word has: R, I, E, S, and one more letter not in {C, A, N, P} and not E,R,I,S (so a new letter).

So the fifth letter is a new letter, say X, that hasn't been guessed.

So the word is: [position1] , I (at 2), [position3], E (at 4), [position5]

And we know:
- The word contains R and S (so either R is at position 3 or 5, and S is at position 1 or 3, but cannot conflict).

Now, let's think about the possibilities:

Option A: Position3 = R, then Position1 must be S (since S cannot be at 5, and 3 is taken by R). Then Position5 must be the other letter, X.

So the word: S, I, R, E, X? But then we have the word as S I R E X? And X is not R or S (but R is at 3) and not E,I. So X is the fifth letter.

But R is at position 3? That would be the third letter. And S at position 1.

But in this case, what about the R feedback in previous guesses? 
- In ""crane"": R was guessed at position 2, which is wrong. And the secret word has R at position 3? Then the feedback for ""crane"" would be for R: marked as present but wrong position? Correct because position 3 is not 2.
- In ""ripes"": R was at position 1 and marked as wrong position? Correct because R is at position 3.

Similarly, S: in ""ripes"" S was at position 5 and marked as wrong position? But in this option, S is at position 1, which is not 5? So that matches.

Now, Option B: Position5 = R, then S can be at position 1 or 3? 
- If S at position 1: then word: S, I, ?, E, R -> with the third position being the unknown letter X?
- If S at position 3: then word: ?, I, S, [E? position4], R -> position1 must be X? But then the word: X, I, S, E, R.

Also, in both subcases, we need to check the feedback.

But we must also consider the S from feedback: S is in the word. So it must be placed.

Now, to choose the next guess, we need to test between these possibilities.

But note: we know position 4 is E and position 2 is I, so we have:

Option A: word = S I R E X? 
Option B1: word = S I X? E R? 
Option B2: word = X I S E R? 

But we also need to find X? 

Actually, we should form a guess that can help differentiate these possibilities.

Moreover, we need to include R and S because we know they are in the word? But we don't have to? Actually, we can use a word that has both? Or we can try to hit the possibilities.

But note: in Option A, R is at position3, so if we guess a word with R at position3, and if it is correct, we get ✓ for R at 3. Similarly, for other positions.

We can try to test a word that puts R at position3 and another at position5? But we cannot do both.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has the S at position1 or position3? 

Let me think of words that fit the known information.

We know the word has the pattern: _ I _ E _ 
With the constraints:
- Position1: either S (in Option A) or other (in Option B, it's either S or X)
- Position3: either R (in Option A) or S or X (in Option B: in B1 position3 is X, not S; in B2 position3 is S)
- Position5: either X (in Option A) or R (in B1 and B2? In B1: R is at5? Option B1: S I X E R -> position5=R; Option B2: X I S E R -> position5=R) 
So in both Option B, position5=R? Because we are putting R at5? So only Option A has R at position3? 

Actually, in Option B: we have R at position5? So in Option A: position3=R, position5=X? In Option B: position5=R and position3 can be either S or X? 

But X is the unknown letter? So:

To summarize:
- Pattern: _ I _ E _
- Must contain R and S? Because we know from feedback that R and S are in the word.

In Option A: position1 = S, position3 = R, position5 = X (unknown)
In Option B1: position1 = S, position3 = X (unknown), position5 = R
In Option B2: position1 = X (unknown), position3 = S, position5 = R

Now, the unknown X must be a letter not in the forbidden list (C, A, N, P) and not E, I, R, S? (because we are using distinct letters? But wait, what if there are duplicates? We don't know. But we haven't encountered duplicates yet, so we assume no duplicates.)

Additionally, the word must be a valid English word.

We can try to form words for these patterns and see which are possible? 

For Option A: pattern: S I R E ? -> possible words? We need words starting with SIRE? 
Common words: 
- SIRED? But that is 5 letters? S-I-R-E-D -> SIRED is a word? Yes, past tense of sire.
- SIRE? But that is 4 letters? So we need 5: SIRED? 
- SIRES? But positions: S at1, I at2, R at3, E at4, S at5? But duplicate S? We don't know if duplicates are allowed? And we had S in feedback from ""ripes"" as present but wrong position? So if we have two S, it's possible? But in ""ripes"", we guessed S at5 and it was marked as wrong position? If the word has S at1 and S at5? Then S would be in the word and at position5? But then if we guessed S at5, it should have been marked as correct? Only if position5 is S? But we were told S is at wrong position? So S cannot be at5. Therefore, if the word has two S's, one at5 would be correct? So we must have S not duplicated? Meaning that S is only at one position? 

Therefore, in Option A, if we have S at1, then S at5 cannot be? So the pattern S I R E ? must have the fifth letter not S? So SIRED is a possibility? Yes, D is not forbidden? D hasn't been guessed. But in ""ripes"" we had E at4, so E is there? And D is new.

Similarly, SIREN? But we know N is not in the word? From first guess? N is out. So SIREN is not possible.

Also, SIR?E? Only SIRED? But what about SIREE? Not a common word? 

But now Option B1: S I X E R? That is, S at1, I at2, X at3, E at4, R at5? This meets the constraints. Words: SIVER? Not a word. SIDER? Not commonly used? Or SIXER? S-I-X-E-R? Sixer is a word? It means a hit in cricket? Ok.

Option B2: X I S E R? Words: WISER? Or MISER? Or RISER? But R is at position5? But we know R is already in the word? But in Option B2, R is at position5? And not duplicated? So WORDS: any 5-letter word ending with SER? With I at2 and E at4? Actually: _ I S E R? 
Common words: MISER, RISER, but R is at position5? And also at position1? If we choose MISER: M-I-S-E-R? But then we have S at position3? That's Option B2? 

Wait: RISER: R-I-S-E-R? Then we have R at position1 and position5? Duplicate R? We don't know if duplicates are allowed? In previous feedback, we haven't ruled out duplicates? 
- But in our feedback for ""ripes"": R was guessed at position1 and marked as wrong position? If the word has R at position5 and does not have R at position1, then it would be marked as wrong position? So that's consistent.
- However, if the word has R at position1 and position5? Then when we guess R at position1, if there is a duplicate R? The feedback might be that the first R is correct? Or it might depend? Actually, in Wordle rules, duplicates are handled by: if a letter is duplicated and you guess it in a position where it exists, it gets ✓. If you guess it more times than it exists, then extras are x. But here, for ""ripes"", if the secret word had R only at position5 (not at1), then R at1 should be marked as -. If it had R at1 and not at5? Then it would be ✓? But we got -, so if there was duplicate R? Then let's say secret word has R at1 and R at5? Then we guess R at1: it would be ✓? So since we got - for R at1 in ""ripes"", it means the secret word has R but not at position1? So there is no R at position1? Therefore, we can have only one R? Or duplicates elsewhere? But we haven't seen duplicates.

So to avoid complications, we will assume no duplicates? Or the word does not have duplicate R? 

Similarly for S: in ""ripes"", S at5 was marked as wrong position? That means the secret word does not have S at position5? So if there is a duplicate S, we still know S is not at5? So we don't care.

Now back to Option B2: pattern X I S E R? Examples: MISER? M is not forbidden? R at5? 
But note: we have R at5? But in Option B2, the letter at position1 is X? And must be a letter that is not C,A,N,P? And hasn't been guessed? And words: MISER, RISER? But RISER: R at1? But we know there is no R at1? Because in ""ripes"" R at1 was marked as wrong position? But if R is at5 and we are considering Option B2, having R at1 is not possible? Because that would require duplicate R? So RISER wouldn't work? Unless duplicate R? But we know from ""ripes"" that position1 is not R? So RISER has R at1? Which would be wrong? So not possible? And also, RISER has R at1 and R at5? Duplicate? So the pattern for Option B2 must be: let's say position1 is a non-R letter? Like MISER: M-I-S-E-R? Then R at5? And M is a new letter? Not guessed before? Similarly, VISER? Not a word? WISER? W-I-S-E-R? But WISER is a word? 

WISER? But then S at position3? And W at1? 

Similarly, for Option B1: pattern S I X E R? Words: SIVER? Not common? SIZER? S-I-Z-E-R? But Z? Not common? SIDER? S-I-D-E-R? SIDER is not common? But we can try.

We need to guess a word that helps us differentiate between these cases? 

We can try to guess a word that has the pattern that fits either Option A or Option B? 

But let's list possible words we can use for the next guess? 

We must meet:
- Position2: I
- Position4: E
- We know R and S are in the word? So we must include them? Or we can omit one? But we are allowed to make any valid word? But to get information, we should include them?

To test between Option A and Option B? 

Let me form a guess that:

Case A: the word should be S I R E X? For example, we can guess ""sired"" to test? But then if we guess ""sired"", and it is the word, we win? If not, then we know Option A is not happening? But we haven't guessed all possibilities? 

But we have many options? 

Alternatively, we can guess a word that puts S at position1 and R at position5? That would force Option B1? For example, guess ""siker""? But let's check.

We can guess a word that uses only allowed letters and tests positions.

We know:

We must test position1: is it S? 
We must test position3: could be R or S or unknown?
We must test position5: could be R or unknown?

So let's form a word that has:

We know position2=I, position4=E? So we set I at2 and E at4? And we choose letters for positions 1,3,5.

To test multiple cases? 

For example, if we guess a word with S at position1 and R at position3? But that is the Option A pattern? Then if correct, we get ✓ for both? But if the word is actually Option B, then we get different feedback.

We can try ""SIREN""? But we know N is out? So invalid.

Alternatively, ""SIRED""? 
Letters: S, I, R, E, D -> and we haven't used D? 

So if we guess ""sired"":
- Pattern: S I R E D
- If the secret word is Option A: S I R E X? Then if X is D, we win? Otherwise, we get feedback that D is not in the word? Or at wrong position? 
But even if X is not D, we have S at1 and R at3? If Option A is true, then S at1 would be ✓? R at3 would be ✓? But E at4? I at2? And D? Would be feedback for D: new letter? It could be ✓ or x.

But if Option B is true? For example, Option B1: the word is S I X E R? So positions: S at1? That would be ✓? I at2✓? But R at3? In Option B1, R is at5? So at position3 would be X? So if we guess R at3, and the secret has no R at3? Then R would be marked as ? Well, we know R is in the word? If the secret word has R at5? Then our guess has R at3? The feedback would be for R: - (since it's in the word but not at3)? And also, we guess position5: D? And the secret has R at5? So D at5 is x? 

Similarly, if Option B2: word is MISER? Then we guess S I R E D? Then position1: S? Secret is M? So x? But wait: secret has S at position3? So S is in the word? Position1: S? So feedback for S: since secret has S, but at position3? And not at1? So marked as -? Position2: I? Secret has I? ✓? Position3: R? Secret has S? So R? We know R is in the secret? But at position5? So R at3 should be marked as present? -? Position4: E, ✓? Position5: D? Secret has R? So x?

But then we will get feedback with ✓ for I and E? - for S and R? And x for D? Which doesn't help us distinguish? 

So let's avoid a direct overlap? 

Alternatively, we can guess a word that has:
- The unknown letter? 
- And tests positions.

We know the secret must have one of:
- Option A: S I R E ?
- Option B1: S I ? E R
- Option B2: ? I S E R

But we have only 4 options? Or one more? 

We can guess a word that doesn't include R or S? To test for the unknown letter? But R and S are required? So we cannot avoid? Or we can avoid? But we know R and S are in the word? But if we exclude them, we might get feedback that R is not at the position? But we already know R and S are in the word? So it's better to include them?

We have to use the known letters: R, S, I, E? Actually I and E are fixed? So the word must have I at2 and E at4? So our guess must have I at2 and E at4? And then we choose 1,3,5 with allowed letters.

We also must include R and S? Because they are in the secret? So should include them? But we are not forced? The guess is not required to have R and S? But if we don't, then we will get feedback that R is missing? But we know R is in the secret? Or no? The feedback may show R as missing? But then we would know we didn't include R? But that doesn't help? So better to include them.

So our guess should include R and S? And have I at2 and E at4?

So pattern: _ I _ E _
With only three spots: 1,3,5 to fill? But we have to include two more letters: R and S? And one of them might fill one spot? But we have three spots? And only need two letters? That implies that one letter will be used in two positions? Or we have duplicate?

But we can choose a letter for the third spot that is new? 

So let's choose letters for position1,3,5.

We need at least R and S to appear in positions 1,3,5 or ... But positions 1,3,5 are the only ones? 

So we have to put R and S somewhere in the three positions? And the third position can be a new letter? 

Now, based on the options:

In Option A: positions: 1=S, 3=R, 5?
In Option B1: positions: 1=S, 3=?, 5=R
In Option B2: positions: 1=?, 3=S, 5=R

For our guess, we assign positions for S and R.

We want to test the positions? So perhaps put S at position1 and R at position3? 

Guess: S I R E X? With X being a new letter? For example, ""sired""? 

But let me see what other options? 

Or we can put S at position1 and R at position5: guess S I ? E R? With the middle letter chosen? For example, with T? ""siter""? Not a word? With D: ""sider""? Not common? With M: ""simer""? Not a word?

Or S at position3 and R at position5: guess ? I S E R? So words: miser, wiser, riser, liser? But riser: R at1? But forbidden because no R at1? So miser, wiser? 

So for the guess, we can try:

Option for our guess: ""sired"" -> S I R E D
- We test: position1=S, position3=R

Or we can try ""miser"" -> M I S E R? Position3=S, position5=R

Or ""wiser"" -> W I S E R

Or if we put S at1 and R at5: we need a word: S I (letter at3) E R? For example, with letter T? ""siter"" not common? With L: ""siler""? Not common? 

Let me list valid English words:

For pattern _ I _ E _:
- With S at1 and R at3: ""sired"" (meaning served as a sire), ""siren"" but N out? ""siree"" not common? 
So ""sired"" is a valid option.

For pattern _ I ? E R? With S at1: 
- With the third letter? Words: ""sider"" not common? ""siker""? Not common? ""siver""? No? 
There may not be common words with S at1 and R at5? 

For pattern _ I S E R: words: ""miser"", ""wiser"", ""riser"" (but R at1 not possible? But ""riser"" has R at1? It's not allowed? So not that? So ""miser"", ""wiser""? 

Also, ""fiser""? Not common.

To choose, we want to test as many new letters as possible? 

Guess ""sired"":
- Uses D as new letter.
- If secret word is Option A? Then S at1? ✓? R at3? ✓? Then we have I and E✓, and D at5? If secret's fifth letter is D? Then all good? If not, then we know it's another letter?
- If secret word is Option B1? Then S at1? ✓? I? ✓? R at3? But secret has R at5? And not at3? So R is in the word? But not at3? So R at3 will be marked as -? Then E✓? D at5? x? So we get S✓, I✓, R(-), E✓, D(x) ? 
- But our third position guess is R? But secret's third position is X? Which is not R? So R? Feedback: because R is in the secret? But not at position3? So it would be marked with -? Yes? 

Also, for Option B2? Secret: X I S E R? Guess: S I R E D? 
Then: position1: S? secret has M? If X is not S? But S is in the secret at position3? So S at1: marked as - (because not at1)? 
Position2: I✓? 
Position3: R? But secret has S at3? So we are guessing R? Which is in the secret? But at position5? So R at3: marked as -? 
Position4: E✓? 
Position5: D? x? 

So feedback: S(-), I✓, R(-), E✓, D(x)

Now, comparing, for Option A: we get 4✓ and one? For Option A with X=D: all✓? For Option A with X not D: then D is x? And other positions would be? Positions 1,2,3,4 should be✓? Because in Option A, position1=S, 2=I, 3=R, 4=E? And position5 is not D? So feedback: S✓, I✓, R✓, E✓, D(x)? 

For Option B1: 
We get: S? position1=S? And secret has S at1? So S✓? I at2✓? R at3? But secret has X at3? So R is at5? So R at3: -? Position4=E✓? Position5=D? But secret has R? So D at5: x? But R is still in the word? So we must see the feedback for R? 

So for case B1: 
- S (position1)✓ because correct.
- I (2)✓
- R (3): present but not at3? Marked as -? 
- E (4)✓? 
- D (5): x? 

So the feedback would be: S(✓) I(✓) R(-) E(✓) D(x)? 

Similarly, Option B2: we get: S at1? Secret has no S at1? But S is in the secret at3? So S at1: marked as -? 
I at2:✓?
R at3? Marked as - because R is not at3? But is in the secret at5? 
E at4:✓? 
D at5: x? 

So same feedback: S(-) I(✓) R(-) E(✓) D(x) 

But in Option A, if X is not D, we get: S(✓) I(✓) R(✓) E(✓) D(x) 

The difference is only in the position of R? 

Specifically, if we guess ""sired"":
- If we get R at position3 as ✓? Then Option A is correct? 
- If we get R at position3 as -? Then Option A is false? Then it's Option B? And the word is that R is not at3? So R must be at5? 

And also, S at1? If we get S at1 as✓? Then it's Option A or Option B1? But in Option B1, S at1 is✓? In Option B2, S at1 is -? 

But in the feedback for Option B1 and B2? For ""sired"", in B1: S at1 is✓ (because Option B1 has S at1)? In B2: S at1 is not the correct letter? So -? 

Therefore, to distinguish:

If we guess ""sired"":
- If S at position1 is ✓ and R at position3 is ✓, then secret word is S I R E D? We win? 
- If S at position1 is ✓ and R at position3 is -, then we know it's Option B1? Because S at1 is✓? So the secret is S I (X) E R? We then know positions: 1=S? 2=I? 4=E? 5=R? And position3? Only missing is position3? Then we can guess the next time? 
- If S at position1 is - and R at position3 is -, then Option B2? Because in B2, S is not at1? And R is not at3? So secret is (X) I S E R? 

Therefore, with one guess, we can distinguish all cases? 

So ""sired"" is a good candidate for the guess. 

But what about non-English words? ""Sired"" is valid: past tense of sire? Or to father offspring? 

We also have the option to guess ""miser"" for example? Let me see if there is a better word? 

But with ""sired"", we have these benefits: 
- It tests S at1? And R at3? 
- It includes all required letters? And uses a new letter D? 
- It covers multiple cases? 

So why not? 

But let's confirm the letters we have used? Avoid multiple? 
We haven't used D? 

So I will go with ""sired"". 

Guess: ""sired"" 

<guess>sired</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

1. **crane** → C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)  
   - Letters **C**, **A**, **N** are **absent**.  
   - **R** and **E** are present but not in positions 2 or 5.  

2. **ripes** → R(-) I(✓) P(x) E(✓) S(-)  
   - **I** is **correct at position 2**.  
   - **E** is **correct at position 4**.  
   - **R** is present (wrong position, not 1).  
   - **S** is present (wrong position, not 5).  
   - **P** is absent.  

### Deductions:
- **Fixed positions**:  
  - Position 2: **I**  
  - Position 4: **E**  
  - Secret word pattern: `_ I _ E _`  
- **Present letters**: **R**, **S** (but not at positions 1 or 5 for R; not at 5 for S).  
- **Absent letters**: **C**, **A**, **N**, **P**.  
- **Possible positions for R**: 3 or 5 (cannot be 1, 2, or 4).  
- **Possible positions for S**: 1 or 3 (cannot be 2, 4, or 5).  
- **Unknown letter**: One new letter (not yet tested) in the remaining position, since duplicates are unlikely given feedback.  

### Plan:
- **Test S at position 1 and R at position 3** with a word that fits `_ I _ E _`.  
- **Key candidates**:  
  - `S I R E _` (e.g., **sired**, if the fifth letter is D).  
  - Alternative patterns (if R is at 5): `S I _ E R` or `_ I S E R`.  
- **Goal**: Differentiate between cases by verifying positions of R and S.  

### Selected Guess: **sired**
- **Reasoning**:  
  - Tests S at position 1 (✓ if correct; ✗/— or x otherwise).  
  - Tests R at position 3 (✓ if correct; — otherwise).  
  - Uses **D** (new letter) to test position 5.  
  - Feedback will resolve ambiguity:
    - If S(✓) and R(✓), secret is **sired** (win).  
    - If S(✓) and R(—), secret likely fits `S I _ E R` (e.g., B1 case).  
    - If S(—) and R(—), secret likely fits `_ I S E R` (e.g., B2 case like **miser**).  
- Avoids forbidden letters **(C, A, N, P)** and reuses known present letters **(R, S)**.  

<guess>sired</guess>",sired,"We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but wrong position)

Second guess: ""ripes""
- R: - (in the word, but wrong position) -> note: in ""ripes"", R is at position 1, so the secret word has R but not at position 1.
- I: ✓ (correct letter and position) -> so position 2 is I.
- P: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct letter and position) -> so position 4 is E.
- S: - (in the word, but wrong position) -> so S is in the word, but not at position 5.

We now know:
- The secret word has: R, I (at position 2), E (at position 4), and S (but not at position 5). Also, from the first guess, we know E is in the word (now confirmed at position 4) and R is in the word (but not at position 1 or 2).
- Letters not in the word: C, A, N, P (and from ""crane"": C, A, N; from ""ripes"": P). Also, from ""crane"", we had E not at 5, which is consistent because now E is at 4.

The current known positions:
- Position 2: I (fixed)
- Position 4: E (fixed)

We also have:
- R is in the word, but not at position 1 (from ""ripes"") and not at position 2 (from ""crane"", and position 2 is I). So R must be at position 3 or 5? Because position 4 is E, so R can be at 3 or 5? Or at position 1? But we just guessed R at position 1 and it was wrong position, so R is not at 1. Similarly, not at 2. So positions available: 3 or 5? But note: positions are 1 to 5. We haven't tried position 3 or 5 for R.

But wait: the word might have more than five letters? No, it's a 5-letter word. So R must be at one of the other positions: 3 or 5? But position 4 is E, so R can be at 3 or 5? Yes.

Also, S is in the word but not at position 5 (from ""ripes"" feedback). So S can be at position 1 or 3? Because positions: 1, 2(I), 3, 4(E), 5. And S cannot be at position 5. Also, we don't know where S is exactly.

We also know that R must be at position 3 or 5, and S must be at position 1 or 3? But if R is at 3 and S at 3, that's impossible. So S can only be at position 1 (if R is at 3 or 5) or at position 3 only if R is not at 3? But R cannot be at S's position. So:

- If R is at position 3, then S must be at position 1 (since position 5 is open but S cannot be at 5? Wait: no, position 5 is available for S? But in the feedback for ""ripes"", S was at position 5 and marked as wrong position? So S cannot be at 5. Therefore, S can only be at position 1 or 3.

But if R is at position 3, then S cannot be at 3 (same position). So then S must be at 1.

If R is at position 5, then S could be at position 1 or 3.

So we have two main cases:

Case 1: R at 3, then S must be at 1.
Case 2: R at 5, then S can be at 1 or 3.

Additionally, we have one more letter to determine: the letter at position 5 in Case 1 is unknown? Or position 3 in Case 2? 

The word structure:
- Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 -> known: 2=I, 4=E.
- Letters: R and S are in the word, and one more letter because we have 5 letters: we have R, I, E, S, and one more unknown letter that hasn't been guessed yet.

We have used: from ""crane"": C,R,A,N,E -> so we know C,A,N are out; from ""ripes"": R,I,P,E,S -> P is out.

So the unknown letter must be a letter that hasn't been guessed: we have guessed letters: C, R, A, N, E, I, P, S.

So we have tried: C, R, A, N, E, I, P, S.

Therefore, the secret word has: R, I, E, S, and one more letter not in {C, A, N, P} and not E,R,I,S (so a new letter).

So the fifth letter is a new letter, say X, that hasn't been guessed.

So the word is: [position1] , I (at 2), [position3], E (at 4), [position5]

And we know:
- The word contains R and S (so either R is at position 3 or 5, and S is at position 1 or 3, but cannot conflict).

Now, let's think about the possibilities:

Option A: Position3 = R, then Position1 must be S (since S cannot be at 5, and 3 is taken by R). Then Position5 must be the other letter, X.

So the word: S, I, R, E, X? But then we have the word as S I R E X? And X is not R or S (but R is at 3) and not E,I. So X is the fifth letter.

But R is at position 3? That would be the third letter. And S at position 1.

But in this case, what about the R feedback in previous guesses? 
- In ""crane"": R was guessed at position 2, which is wrong. And the secret word has R at position 3? Then the feedback for ""crane"" would be for R: marked as present but wrong position? Correct because position 3 is not 2.
- In ""ripes"": R was at position 1 and marked as wrong position? Correct because R is at position 3.

Similarly, S: in ""ripes"" S was at position 5 and marked as wrong position? But in this option, S is at position 1, which is not 5? So that matches.

Now, Option B: Position5 = R, then S can be at position 1 or 3? 
- If S at position 1: then word: S, I, ?, E, R -> with the third position being the unknown letter X?
- If S at position 3: then word: ?, I, S, [E? position4], R -> position1 must be X? But then the word: X, I, S, E, R.

Also, in both subcases, we need to check the feedback.

But we must also consider the S from feedback: S is in the word. So it must be placed.

Now, to choose the next guess, we need to test between these possibilities.

But note: we know position 4 is E and position 2 is I, so we have:

Option A: word = S I R E X? 
Option B1: word = S I X? E R? 
Option B2: word = X I S E R? 

But we also need to find X? 

Actually, we should form a guess that can help differentiate these possibilities.

Moreover, we need to include R and S because we know they are in the word? But we don't have to? Actually, we can use a word that has both? Or we can try to hit the possibilities.

But note: in Option A, R is at position3, so if we guess a word with R at position3, and if it is correct, we get ✓ for R at 3. Similarly, for other positions.

We can try to test a word that puts R at position3 and another at position5? But we cannot do both.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has the S at position1 or position3? 

Let me think of words that fit the known information.

We know the word has the pattern: _ I _ E _ 
With the constraints:
- Position1: either S (in Option A) or other (in Option B, it's either S or X)
- Position3: either R (in Option A) or S or X (in Option B: in B1 position3 is X, not S; in B2 position3 is S)
- Position5: either X (in Option A) or R (in B1 and B2? In B1: R is at5? Option B1: S I X E R -> position5=R; Option B2: X I S E R -> position5=R) 
So in both Option B, position5=R? Because we are putting R at5? So only Option A has R at position3? 

Actually, in Option B: we have R at position5? So in Option A: position3=R, position5=X? In Option B: position5=R and position3 can be either S or X? 

But X is the unknown letter? So:

To summarize:
- Pattern: _ I _ E _
- Must contain R and S? Because we know from feedback that R and S are in the word.

In Option A: position1 = S, position3 = R, position5 = X (unknown)
In Option B1: position1 = S, position3 = X (unknown), position5 = R
In Option B2: position1 = X (unknown), position3 = S, position5 = R

Now, the unknown X must be a letter not in the forbidden list (C, A, N, P) and not E, I, R, S? (because we are using distinct letters? But wait, what if there are duplicates? We don't know. But we haven't encountered duplicates yet, so we assume no duplicates.)

Additionally, the word must be a valid English word.

We can try to form words for these patterns and see which are possible? 

For Option A: pattern: S I R E ? -> possible words? We need words starting with SIRE? 
Common words: 
- SIRED? But that is 5 letters? S-I-R-E-D -> SIRED is a word? Yes, past tense of sire.
- SIRE? But that is 4 letters? So we need 5: SIRED? 
- SIRES? But positions: S at1, I at2, R at3, E at4, S at5? But duplicate S? We don't know if duplicates are allowed? And we had S in feedback from ""ripes"" as present but wrong position? So if we have two S, it's possible? But in ""ripes"", we guessed S at5 and it was marked as wrong position? If the word has S at1 and S at5? Then S would be in the word and at position5? But then if we guessed S at5, it should have been marked as correct? Only if position5 is S? But we were told S is at wrong position? So S cannot be at5. Therefore, if the word has two S's, one at5 would be correct? So we must have S not duplicated? Meaning that S is only at one position? 

Therefore, in Option A, if we have S at1, then S at5 cannot be? So the pattern S I R E ? must have the fifth letter not S? So SIRED is a possibility? Yes, D is not forbidden? D hasn't been guessed. But in ""ripes"" we had E at4, so E is there? And D is new.

Similarly, SIREN? But we know N is not in the word? From first guess? N is out. So SIREN is not possible.

Also, SIR?E? Only SIRED? But what about SIREE? Not a common word? 

But now Option B1: S I X E R? That is, S at1, I at2, X at3, E at4, R at5? This meets the constraints. Words: SIVER? Not a word. SIDER? Not commonly used? Or SIXER? S-I-X-E-R? Sixer is a word? It means a hit in cricket? Ok.

Option B2: X I S E R? Words: WISER? Or MISER? Or RISER? But R is at position5? But we know R is already in the word? But in Option B2, R is at position5? And not duplicated? So WORDS: any 5-letter word ending with SER? With I at2 and E at4? Actually: _ I S E R? 
Common words: MISER, RISER, but R is at position5? And also at position1? If we choose MISER: M-I-S-E-R? But then we have S at position3? That's Option B2? 

Wait: RISER: R-I-S-E-R? Then we have R at position1 and position5? Duplicate R? We don't know if duplicates are allowed? In previous feedback, we haven't ruled out duplicates? 
- But in our feedback for ""ripes"": R was guessed at position1 and marked as wrong position? If the word has R at position5 and does not have R at position1, then it would be marked as wrong position? So that's consistent.
- However, if the word has R at position1 and position5? Then when we guess R at position1, if there is a duplicate R? The feedback might be that the first R is correct? Or it might depend? Actually, in Wordle rules, duplicates are handled by: if a letter is duplicated and you guess it in a position where it exists, it gets ✓. If you guess it more times than it exists, then extras are x. But here, for ""ripes"", if the secret word had R only at position5 (not at1), then R at1 should be marked as -. If it had R at1 and not at5? Then it would be ✓? But we got -, so if there was duplicate R? Then let's say secret word has R at1 and R at5? Then we guess R at1: it would be ✓? So since we got - for R at1 in ""ripes"", it means the secret word has R but not at position1? So there is no R at position1? Therefore, we can have only one R? Or duplicates elsewhere? But we haven't seen duplicates.

So to avoid complications, we will assume no duplicates? Or the word does not have duplicate R? 

Similarly for S: in ""ripes"", S at5 was marked as wrong position? That means the secret word does not have S at position5? So if there is a duplicate S, we still know S is not at5? So we don't care.

Now back to Option B2: pattern X I S E R? Examples: MISER? M is not forbidden? R at5? 
But note: we have R at5? But in Option B2, the letter at position1 is X? And must be a letter that is not C,A,N,P? And hasn't been guessed? And words: MISER, RISER? But RISER: R at1? But we know there is no R at1? Because in ""ripes"" R at1 was marked as wrong position? But if R is at5 and we are considering Option B2, having R at1 is not possible? Because that would require duplicate R? So RISER wouldn't work? Unless duplicate R? But we know from ""ripes"" that position1 is not R? So RISER has R at1? Which would be wrong? So not possible? And also, RISER has R at1 and R at5? Duplicate? So the pattern for Option B2 must be: let's say position1 is a non-R letter? Like MISER: M-I-S-E-R? Then R at5? And M is a new letter? Not guessed before? Similarly, VISER? Not a word? WISER? W-I-S-E-R? But WISER is a word? 

WISER? But then S at position3? And W at1? 

Similarly, for Option B1: pattern S I X E R? Words: SIVER? Not common? SIZER? S-I-Z-E-R? But Z? Not common? SIDER? S-I-D-E-R? SIDER is not common? But we can try.

We need to guess a word that helps us differentiate between these cases? 

We can try to guess a word that has the pattern that fits either Option A or Option B? 

But let's list possible words we can use for the next guess? 

We must meet:
- Position2: I
- Position4: E
- We know R and S are in the word? So we must include them? Or we can omit one? But we are allowed to make any valid word? But to get information, we should include them?

To test between Option A and Option B? 

Let me form a guess that:

Case A: the word should be S I R E X? For example, we can guess ""sired"" to test? But then if we guess ""sired"", and it is the word, we win? If not, then we know Option A is not happening? But we haven't guessed all possibilities? 

But we have many options? 

Alternatively, we can guess a word that puts S at position1 and R at position5? That would force Option B1? For example, guess ""siker""? But let's check.

We can guess a word that uses only allowed letters and tests positions.

We know:

We must test position1: is it S? 
We must test position3: could be R or S or unknown?
We must test position5: could be R or unknown?

So let's form a word that has:

We know position2=I, position4=E? So we set I at2 and E at4? And we choose letters for positions 1,3,5.

To test multiple cases? 

For example, if we guess a word with S at position1 and R at position3? But that is the Option A pattern? Then if correct, we get ✓ for both? But if the word is actually Option B, then we get different feedback.

We can try ""SIREN""? But we know N is out? So invalid.

Alternatively, ""SIRED""? 
Letters: S, I, R, E, D -> and we haven't used D? 

So if we guess ""sired"":
- Pattern: S I R E D
- If the secret word is Option A: S I R E X? Then if X is D, we win? Otherwise, we get feedback that D is not in the word? Or at wrong position? 
But even if X is not D, we have S at1 and R at3? If Option A is true, then S at1 would be ✓? R at3 would be ✓? But E at4? I at2? And D? Would be feedback for D: new letter? It could be ✓ or x.

But if Option B is true? For example, Option B1: the word is S I X E R? So positions: S at1? That would be ✓? I at2✓? But R at3? In Option B1, R is at5? So at position3 would be X? So if we guess R at3, and the secret has no R at3? Then R would be marked as ? Well, we know R is in the word? If the secret word has R at5? Then our guess has R at3? The feedback would be for R: - (since it's in the word but not at3)? And also, we guess position5: D? And the secret has R at5? So D at5 is x? 

Similarly, if Option B2: word is MISER? Then we guess S I R E D? Then position1: S? Secret is M? So x? But wait: secret has S at position3? So S is in the word? Position1: S? So feedback for S: since secret has S, but at position3? And not at1? So marked as -? Position2: I? Secret has I? ✓? Position3: R? Secret has S? So R? We know R is in the secret? But at position5? So R at3 should be marked as present? -? Position4: E, ✓? Position5: D? Secret has R? So x?

But then we will get feedback with ✓ for I and E? - for S and R? And x for D? Which doesn't help us distinguish? 

So let's avoid a direct overlap? 

Alternatively, we can guess a word that has:
- The unknown letter? 
- And tests positions.

We know the secret must have one of:
- Option A: S I R E ?
- Option B1: S I ? E R
- Option B2: ? I S E R

But we have only 4 options? Or one more? 

We can guess a word that doesn't include R or S? To test for the unknown letter? But R and S are required? So we cannot avoid? Or we can avoid? But we know R and S are in the word? But if we exclude them, we might get feedback that R is not at the position? But we already know R and S are in the word? So it's better to include them?

We have to use the known letters: R, S, I, E? Actually I and E are fixed? So the word must have I at2 and E at4? So our guess must have I at2 and E at4? And then we choose 1,3,5 with allowed letters.

We also must include R and S? Because they are in the secret? So should include them? But we are not forced? The guess is not required to have R and S? But if we don't, then we will get feedback that R is missing? But we know R is in the secret? Or no? The feedback may show R as missing? But then we would know we didn't include R? But that doesn't help? So better to include them.

So our guess should include R and S? And have I at2 and E at4?

So pattern: _ I _ E _
With only three spots: 1,3,5 to fill? But we have to include two more letters: R and S? And one of them might fill one spot? But we have three spots? And only need two letters? That implies that one letter will be used in two positions? Or we have duplicate?

But we can choose a letter for the third spot that is new? 

So let's choose letters for position1,3,5.

We need at least R and S to appear in positions 1,3,5 or ... But positions 1,3,5 are the only ones? 

So we have to put R and S somewhere in the three positions? And the third position can be a new letter? 

Now, based on the options:

In Option A: positions: 1=S, 3=R, 5?
In Option B1: positions: 1=S, 3=?, 5=R
In Option B2: positions: 1=?, 3=S, 5=R

For our guess, we assign positions for S and R.

We want to test the positions? So perhaps put S at position1 and R at position3? 

Guess: S I R E X? With X being a new letter? For example, ""sired""? 

But let me see what other options? 

Or we can put S at position1 and R at position5: guess S I ? E R? With the middle letter chosen? For example, with T? ""siter""? Not a word? With D: ""sider""? Not common? With M: ""simer""? Not a word?

Or S at position3 and R at position5: guess ? I S E R? So words: miser, wiser, riser, liser? But riser: R at1? But forbidden because no R at1? So miser, wiser? 

So for the guess, we can try:

Option for our guess: ""sired"" -> S I R E D
- We test: position1=S, position3=R

Or we can try ""miser"" -> M I S E R? Position3=S, position5=R

Or ""wiser"" -> W I S E R

Or if we put S at1 and R at5: we need a word: S I (letter at3) E R? For example, with letter T? ""siter"" not common? With L: ""siler""? Not common? 

Let me list valid English words:

For pattern _ I _ E _:
- With S at1 and R at3: ""sired"" (meaning served as a sire), ""siren"" but N out? ""siree"" not common? 
So ""sired"" is a valid option.

For pattern _ I ? E R? With S at1: 
- With the third letter? Words: ""sider"" not common? ""siker""? Not common? ""siver""? No? 
There may not be common words with S at1 and R at5? 

For pattern _ I S E R: words: ""miser"", ""wiser"", ""riser"" (but R at1 not possible? But ""riser"" has R at1? It's not allowed? So not that? So ""miser"", ""wiser""? 

Also, ""fiser""? Not common.

To choose, we want to test as many new letters as possible? 

Guess ""sired"":
- Uses D as new letter.
- If secret word is Option A? Then S at1? ✓? R at3? ✓? Then we have I and E✓, and D at5? If secret's fifth letter is D? Then all good? If not, then we know it's another letter?
- If secret word is Option B1? Then S at1? ✓? I? ✓? R at3? But secret has R at5? And not at3? So R is in the word? But not at3? So R at3 will be marked as -? Then E✓? D at5? x? So we get S✓, I✓, R(-), E✓, D(x) ? 
- But our third position guess is R? But secret's third position is X? Which is not R? So R? Feedback: because R is in the secret? But not at position3? So it would be marked with -? Yes? 

Also, for Option B2? Secret: X I S E R? Guess: S I R E D? 
Then: position1: S? secret has M? If X is not S? But S is in the secret at position3? So S at1: marked as - (because not at1)? 
Position2: I✓? 
Position3: R? But secret has S at3? So we are guessing R? Which is in the secret? But at position5? So R at3: marked as -? 
Position4: E✓? 
Position5: D? x? 

So feedback: S(-), I✓, R(-), E✓, D(x)

Now, comparing, for Option A: we get 4✓ and one? For Option A with X=D: all✓? For Option A with X not D: then D is x? And other positions would be? Positions 1,2,3,4 should be✓? Because in Option A, position1=S, 2=I, 3=R, 4=E? And position5 is not D? So feedback: S✓, I✓, R✓, E✓, D(x)? 

For Option B1: 
We get: S? position1=S? And secret has S at1? So S✓? I at2✓? R at3? But secret has X at3? So R is at5? So R at3: -? Position4=E✓? Position5=D? But secret has R? So D at5: x? But R is still in the word? So we must see the feedback for R? 

So for case B1: 
- S (position1)✓ because correct.
- I (2)✓
- R (3): present but not at3? Marked as -? 
- E (4)✓? 
- D (5): x? 

So the feedback would be: S(✓) I(✓) R(-) E(✓) D(x)? 

Similarly, Option B2: we get: S at1? Secret has no S at1? But S is in the secret at3? So S at1: marked as -? 
I at2:✓?
R at3? Marked as - because R is not at3? But is in the secret at5? 
E at4:✓? 
D at5: x? 

So same feedback: S(-) I(✓) R(-) E(✓) D(x) 

But in Option A, if X is not D, we get: S(✓) I(✓) R(✓) E(✓) D(x) 

The difference is only in the position of R? 

Specifically, if we guess ""sired"":
- If we get R at position3 as ✓? Then Option A is correct? 
- If we get R at position3 as -? Then Option A is false? Then it's Option B? And the word is that R is not at3? So R must be at5? 

And also, S at1? If we get S at1 as✓? Then it's Option A or Option B1? But in Option B1, S at1 is✓? In Option B2, S at1 is -? 

But in the feedback for Option B1 and B2? For ""sired"", in B1: S at1 is✓ (because Option B1 has S at1)? In B2: S at1 is not the correct letter? So -? 

Therefore, to distinguish:

If we guess ""sired"":
- If S at position1 is ✓ and R at position3 is ✓, then secret word is S I R E D? We win? 
- If S at position1 is ✓ and R at position3 is -, then we know it's Option B1? Because S at1 is✓? So the secret is S I (X) E R? We then know positions: 1=S? 2=I? 4=E? 5=R? And position3? Only missing is position3? Then we can guess the next time? 
- If S at position1 is - and R at position3 is -, then Option B2? Because in B2, S is not at1? And R is not at3? So secret is (X) I S E R? 

Therefore, with one guess, we can distinguish all cases? 

So ""sired"" is a good candidate for the guess. 

But what about non-English words? ""Sired"" is valid: past tense of sire? Or to father offspring? 

We also have the option to guess ""miser"" for example? Let me see if there is a better word? 

But with ""sired"", we have these benefits: 
- It tests S at1? And R at3? 
- It includes all required letters? And uses a new letter D? 
- It covers multiple cases? 

So why not? 

But let's confirm the letters we have used? Avoid multiple? 
We haven't used D? 

So I will go with ""sired"". 

Guess: ""sired"" 

<guess>sired</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

1. **crane** → C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)  
   - Letters **C**, **A**, **N** are **absent**.  
   - **R** and **E** are present but not in positions 2 or 5.  

2. **ripes** → R(-) I(✓) P(x) E(✓) S(-)  
   - **I** is **correct at position 2**.  
   - **E** is **correct at position 4**.  
   - **R** is present (wrong position, not 1).  
   - **S** is present (wrong position, not 5).  
   - **P** is absent.  

### Deductions:
- **Fixed positions**:  
  - Position 2: **I**  
  - Position 4: **E**  
  - Secret word pattern: `_ I _ E _`  
- **Present letters**: **R**, **S** (but not at positions 1 or 5 for R; not at 5 for S).  
- **Absent letters**: **C**, **A**, **N**, **P**.  
- **Possible positions for R**: 3 or 5 (cannot be 1, 2, or 4).  
- **Possible positions for S**: 1 or 3 (cannot be 2, 4, or 5).  
- **Unknown letter**: One new letter (not yet tested) in the remaining position, since duplicates are unlikely given feedback.  

### Plan:
- **Test S at position 1 and R at position 3** with a word that fits `_ I _ E _`.  
- **Key candidates**:  
  - `S I R E _` (e.g., **sired**, if the fifth letter is D).  
  - Alternative patterns (if R is at 5): `S I _ E R` or `_ I S E R`.  
- **Goal**: Differentiate between cases by verifying positions of R and S.  

### Selected Guess: **sired**
- **Reasoning**:  
  - Tests S at position 1 (✓ if correct; ✗/— or x otherwise).  
  - Tests R at position 3 (✓ if correct; — otherwise).  
  - Uses **D** (new letter) to test position 5.  
  - Feedback will resolve ambiguity:
    - If S(✓) and R(✓), secret is **sired** (win).  
    - If S(✓) and R(—), secret likely fits `S I _ E R` (e.g., B1 case).  
    - If S(—) and R(—), secret likely fits `_ I S E R` (e.g., B2 case like **miser**).  
- Avoids forbidden letters **(C, A, N, P)** and reuses known present letters **(R, S)**.",Guess 3: sired -> FEEDBACK: S(-) I(✓) R(-) E(✓) D(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,miser,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The letters C, A, N are not in the secret word.
 - The letter R is in the word, but not in the second position (since we guessed it in the second position and it was marked as wrong position).
 - The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position.

 Also, note that the secret word must contain R and E, and does not contain C, A, N.

 Since R is in the word but not in position 2, and E is in the word but not in position 5, we can try to form a new guess.

 We have to avoid using C, A, N.

 Let's think of a word that includes R and E, and also uses other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

 We have already used: C, R, A, N, E.

 We can try to use other common consonants and vowels. Common letters include: S, T, L, O, U, D, G, H, I, etc.

 We know R must be in the word, but not at position 2. So R can be at positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: in the feedback, we had R at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So R is in the word but not at position 2.

 Similarly, E is in the word but not at position 5.

 We also know that the word does not have C, A, N.

 Let's try to think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N.

 We can try a word that puts R in a different position and E in a different position.

 For example, we might try to put R at position 1 and E at position 3? Or other positions.

 But note: we don't know the exact positions yet.

 We can also consider that the word might have other common letters.

 Let's try the word ""ROLES"" as a possibility? But wait, we have to avoid A, C, N, and we haven't used O, L, S.

 However, note that in the feedback, we have R and E present. But we must also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? The rules don't say anything about duplicate letters, but typically in Wordle, words can have duplicates. However, the feedback for ""crane"" didn't show any duplicate, so we don't have evidence of duplicates yet.

 But let's check: if we use ""ROLES"":
 - R at position 1: if the secret word has R at position 1, then it would be marked as correct (✓). But in our feedback, R was in the word but not at position 2, so it could be at position 1? Actually, yes, it could be at position 1.

 However, we don't know if R is at position 1 or not. So we can try a word that has R in a position we haven't tried and E in a position we haven't tried.

 Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has as many new letters as possible to get more information.

 Let me think of a word that includes R and E, and uses three new letters.

 Some possibilities: 
 - ""RICES"" -> but C is not allowed (we know C is not in the word) and also we have C in the word which is already known to be absent? So we cannot use C.

 We must avoid C, A, N.

 So let's try: ""ROUTE"", ""RISES"", ""ROBES"", ""RULES"", ""RIPES"", ""ROGUE"", etc.

 But note: we also want to test other common letters. Let's try to include S, T, L, etc.

 Another idea: we can try ""STORE"". But let's check:
 - S: new
 - T: new
 - O: new
 - R: we know it's in the word, but we are putting it at position 4? 
 - E: we know it's in the word, but we are putting it at position 5? But wait, in the first guess, E was at position 5 and was marked as wrong position. So E cannot be at position 5. Therefore, we cannot put E at position 5 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not at position 5. So we should avoid putting E at position 5.

 Therefore, we should avoid putting E at the fifth position and R at the second position.

 So for ""STORE"": 
 - R is at position 4 -> that's a new position for R, so it might be correct or not.
 - E is at position 5 -> but we know E is not at position 5, so it would be marked as present but wrong position again? We don't get new information about E's position? Actually, we would get that E is not at position 5 (which we already know) and we don't learn about other positions.

 So we should try to put E in a different position, say position 2, 3, or 4.

 Similarly, R should be in a position that is not 2. We can try position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Let me try to form a word that has R at position 1 and E at position 3? For example: ""RESTY"" (if we allow Y). But we need to make sure it's a valid word.

 Alternatively, ""RESET"" has duplicate E? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. We should avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.

 How about ""ROBES""? 
 - R at 1, O at 2, B at 3, E at 4, S at 5.
 But note: we are putting E at position 4? That's a new position. And R at position 1? That's a new position.

 However, we have to avoid using letters we know are absent: C, A, N. ""ROBES"" uses R, O, B, E, S. None of these are C, A, N. So it's okay.

 But wait: what if the secret word has O? We don't know. We are testing O and B and S.

 Alternatively, we can try ""RIPEN"" but N is not allowed. So we cannot use N.

 Another word: ""RIPED""? Not a word. ""RIPES"" is a word? Yes, meaning to tear or pull.

 ""RIPES"": 
 - R at 1, I at 2, P at 3, E at 4, S at 5.

 This avoids the forbidden letters and puts R at a new position (1) and E at a new position (4). Also, we test I, P, S.

 But note: in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was present but wrong. So if we put R at position 1, and if the secret word has R at position 1, we'll get a ✓. If not, then we'll get a - (if R is elsewhere) or x (if R is not at 1) but we know R is in the word so it would be - if not at 1.

 Similarly, E at position 4: if the secret word has E at position 4, we get ✓, else we get - (since we know E is in the word).

 However, we are also testing I at position 2 and P at position 3 and S at position 5.

 But wait: we know that the secret word does not have A, C, N. So we are safe.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in the middle? 

 Another common word: ""DRIVE"" -> but D is new, R at position 2? We cannot put R at position 2 because we already know that position 2 is not R. So we should avoid position 2 for R? Actually, we can put R at position 2 again? But we know it's not there, so it would be marked as present but wrong position again? That doesn't give new information. So we should avoid putting R at position 2.

 Therefore, ""DRIVE"" is not good because R is at position 2.

 How about ""DRUPE""? (a kind of fruit) -> R at position 3? and E at position 5? But we know E is not at position 5. So we avoid E at 5.

 Let me think of a word that has E at position 3: for example, ""CRWTH"" is not common and has C. Avoid.

 Another: ""TREES"" -> duplicate E? and E at position 5? Avoid.

 How about ""STREP""? 
 - S at 1, T at 2, R at 3, E at 4, P at 5.
 This puts R at position 3 (new) and E at position 4 (new). And we test S, T, P.

 But note: we are putting R at position 3 and E at position 4. Also, we avoid forbidden letters.

 However, we are using 5 new letters: S, T, R, E, P. But we already know R and E are in the word, so we are testing S, T, P.

 This seems good.

 But wait: we are not using the fact that we can put R at position 1? We might get more information by trying R at position 1.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROUSE"": 
 - R at 1, O at 2, U at 3, S at 4, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is not allowed? We know E is not at 5, so we avoid.

 How about ""ROUSE"" is not good because of E at 5.

 Then let me try ""ROBES"" again: 
 - R at 1, O at 2, B at 3, E at 4, S at 5 -> E at 4? That's good.

 But we are putting E at 4, which is a new position.

 Alternatively, ""RULES"": 
 - R at 1, U at 2, L at 3, E at 4, S at 5 -> same as above, E at 4.

 But we are testing U and L.

 I think ""RULES"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters and we haven't tried U and L.

 However, we might also consider ""ROUTE"": 
 - R at 1, O at 2, U at 3, T at 4, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is not allowed.

 So we avoid.

 Another word: ""RIPES"" (as I thought earlier) or ""RISES"" (but S at 5? and we have two S's? ""RISES"" has two S's? Actually, it's R-I-S-E-S -> so two S's? That might not be ideal because we are testing fewer letters.

 We want to test as many new letters as possible. So words with 5 distinct letters are better.

 ""RIPES"" has distinct letters: R, I, P, E, S.

 So does ""RULES"": R, U, L, E, S.

 Both are good.

 But note: we already know R and E are in the word, so we are testing I, P, S in ""RIPES"" and U, L, S in ""RULES"".

 Since we have limited tries, we want to maximize the chance of hitting the correct letters and also get position information.

 I think I'll go with ""RIPES"" because it uses I and P which are common.

 But let me check: we have to avoid A, C, N. So ""RIPES"" is safe.

 So my second guess: ""RIPES""

 We'll see:
 - If R is at position 1: we get ✓ or - (if not at 1, but we know it's in the word so it would be -)
 - I at position 2: we don't know, so we get feedback.
 - P at position 3: feedback.
 - E at position 4: if E is at 4, we get ✓, else - (because E is in the word)
 - S at position 5: feedback.

 This will give us more information.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't put R at the beginning? But we don't know where R is. We are trying to find the position.

 But we have to try R in a new position. We tried position 2 (in ""crane"") and now we try position 1. We can also try position 3, 4, or 5 in future guesses.

 So I think ""RIPES"" is a good guess.

 Let me write it: R I P E S

 But wait: what if the secret word has R at position 1? Then we get a ✓ and we know the first letter. That would be great.

 If not, then we know R is not at position 1 and we can try other positions.

 So I'll go with ""RIPES"".

<guess>ripes</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, A, N** are **not** in the secret word.
- **R** is in the word but **not in position 2**.
- **E** is in the word but **not in position 5**.

For the next guess:
- Avoid **C, A, N** entirely.
- Include **R** and **E**, but place them in new positions (not position 2 for R, not position 5 for E).
- Test new common letters (**I, P, S**) to gather more information.
- Prioritize distinct letters to maximize coverage.

The word **""RIPES""** fits these criteria:
- Places **R** at position 1 (new position, could be correct or reveal another location).
- Places **E** at position 4 (new position, avoids position 5).
- Tests **I** (position 2), **P** (position 3), and **S** (position 5) for the first time.
- Uses no forbidden letters (C, A, N) and no duplicates.

This guess will efficiently narrow down possible positions for R and E while checking three new letters.

<guess>ripes</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: ripes -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(✓) P(x) E(✓) S(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but wrong position)

Second guess: ""ripes""
- R: - (in the word, but wrong position) -> note: in ""ripes"", R is at position 1, so the secret word has R but not at position 1.
- I: ✓ (correct letter and position) -> so position 2 is I.
- P: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct letter and position) -> so position 4 is E.
- S: - (in the word, but wrong position) -> so S is in the word, but not at position 5.

We now know:
- The secret word has: R, I (at position 2), E (at position 4), and S (but not at position 5). Also, from the first guess, we know E is in the word (now confirmed at position 4) and R is in the word (but not at position 1 or 2).
- Letters not in the word: C, A, N, P (and from ""crane"": C, A, N; from ""ripes"": P). Also, from ""crane"", we had E not at 5, which is consistent because now E is at 4.

The current known positions:
- Position 2: I (fixed)
- Position 4: E (fixed)

We also have:
- R is in the word, but not at position 1 (from ""ripes"") and not at position 2 (from ""crane"", and position 2 is I). So R must be at position 3 or 5? Because position 4 is E, so R can be at 3 or 5? Or at position 1? But we just guessed R at position 1 and it was wrong position, so R is not at 1. Similarly, not at 2. So positions available: 3 or 5? But note: positions are 1 to 5. We haven't tried position 3 or 5 for R.

But wait: the word might have more than five letters? No, it's a 5-letter word. So R must be at one of the other positions: 3 or 5? But position 4 is E, so R can be at 3 or 5? Yes.

Also, S is in the word but not at position 5 (from ""ripes"" feedback). So S can be at position 1 or 3? Because positions: 1, 2(I), 3, 4(E), 5. And S cannot be at position 5. Also, we don't know where S is exactly.

We also know that R must be at position 3 or 5, and S must be at position 1 or 3? But if R is at 3 and S at 3, that's impossible. So S can only be at position 1 (if R is at 3 or 5) or at position 3 only if R is not at 3? But R cannot be at S's position. So:

- If R is at position 3, then S must be at position 1 (since position 5 is open but S cannot be at 5? Wait: no, position 5 is available for S? But in the feedback for ""ripes"", S was at position 5 and marked as wrong position? So S cannot be at 5. Therefore, S can only be at position 1 or 3.

But if R is at position 3, then S cannot be at 3 (same position). So then S must be at 1.

If R is at position 5, then S could be at position 1 or 3.

So we have two main cases:

Case 1: R at 3, then S must be at 1.
Case 2: R at 5, then S can be at 1 or 3.

Additionally, we have one more letter to determine: the letter at position 5 in Case 1 is unknown? Or position 3 in Case 2? 

The word structure:
- Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 -> known: 2=I, 4=E.
- Letters: R and S are in the word, and one more letter because we have 5 letters: we have R, I, E, S, and one more unknown letter that hasn't been guessed yet.

We have used: from ""crane"": C,R,A,N,E -> so we know C,A,N are out; from ""ripes"": R,I,P,E,S -> P is out.

So the unknown letter must be a letter that hasn't been guessed: we have guessed letters: C, R, A, N, E, I, P, S.

So we have tried: C, R, A, N, E, I, P, S.

Therefore, the secret word has: R, I, E, S, and one more letter not in {C, A, N, P} and not E,R,I,S (so a new letter).

So the fifth letter is a new letter, say X, that hasn't been guessed.

So the word is: [position1] , I (at 2), [position3], E (at 4), [position5]

And we know:
- The word contains R and S (so either R is at position 3 or 5, and S is at position 1 or 3, but cannot conflict).

Now, let's think about the possibilities:

Option A: Position3 = R, then Position1 must be S (since S cannot be at 5, and 3 is taken by R). Then Position5 must be the other letter, X.

So the word: S, I, R, E, X? But then we have the word as S I R E X? And X is not R or S (but R is at 3) and not E,I. So X is the fifth letter.

But R is at position 3? That would be the third letter. And S at position 1.

But in this case, what about the R feedback in previous guesses? 
- In ""crane"": R was guessed at position 2, which is wrong. And the secret word has R at position 3? Then the feedback for ""crane"" would be for R: marked as present but wrong position? Correct because position 3 is not 2.
- In ""ripes"": R was at position 1 and marked as wrong position? Correct because R is at position 3.

Similarly, S: in ""ripes"" S was at position 5 and marked as wrong position? But in this option, S is at position 1, which is not 5? So that matches.

Now, Option B: Position5 = R, then S can be at position 1 or 3? 
- If S at position 1: then word: S, I, ?, E, R -> with the third position being the unknown letter X?
- If S at position 3: then word: ?, I, S, [E? position4], R -> position1 must be X? But then the word: X, I, S, E, R.

Also, in both subcases, we need to check the feedback.

But we must also consider the S from feedback: S is in the word. So it must be placed.

Now, to choose the next guess, we need to test between these possibilities.

But note: we know position 4 is E and position 2 is I, so we have:

Option A: word = S I R E X? 
Option B1: word = S I X? E R? 
Option B2: word = X I S E R? 

But we also need to find X? 

Actually, we should form a guess that can help differentiate these possibilities.

Moreover, we need to include R and S because we know they are in the word? But we don't have to? Actually, we can use a word that has both? Or we can try to hit the possibilities.

But note: in Option A, R is at position3, so if we guess a word with R at position3, and if it is correct, we get ✓ for R at 3. Similarly, for other positions.

We can try to test a word that puts R at position3 and another at position5? But we cannot do both.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has the S at position1 or position3? 

Let me think of words that fit the known information.

We know the word has the pattern: _ I _ E _ 
With the constraints:
- Position1: either S (in Option A) or other (in Option B, it's either S or X)
- Position3: either R (in Option A) or S or X (in Option B: in B1 position3 is X, not S; in B2 position3 is S)
- Position5: either X (in Option A) or R (in B1 and B2? In B1: R is at5? Option B1: S I X E R -> position5=R; Option B2: X I S E R -> position5=R) 
So in both Option B, position5=R? Because we are putting R at5? So only Option A has R at position3? 

Actually, in Option B: we have R at position5? So in Option A: position3=R, position5=X? In Option B: position5=R and position3 can be either S or X? 

But X is the unknown letter? So:

To summarize:
- Pattern: _ I _ E _
- Must contain R and S? Because we know from feedback that R and S are in the word.

In Option A: position1 = S, position3 = R, position5 = X (unknown)
In Option B1: position1 = S, position3 = X (unknown), position5 = R
In Option B2: position1 = X (unknown), position3 = S, position5 = R

Now, the unknown X must be a letter not in the forbidden list (C, A, N, P) and not E, I, R, S? (because we are using distinct letters? But wait, what if there are duplicates? We don't know. But we haven't encountered duplicates yet, so we assume no duplicates.)

Additionally, the word must be a valid English word.

We can try to form words for these patterns and see which are possible? 

For Option A: pattern: S I R E ? -> possible words? We need words starting with SIRE? 
Common words: 
- SIRED? But that is 5 letters? S-I-R-E-D -> SIRED is a word? Yes, past tense of sire.
- SIRE? But that is 4 letters? So we need 5: SIRED? 
- SIRES? But positions: S at1, I at2, R at3, E at4, S at5? But duplicate S? We don't know if duplicates are allowed? And we had S in feedback from ""ripes"" as present but wrong position? So if we have two S, it's possible? But in ""ripes"", we guessed S at5 and it was marked as wrong position? If the word has S at1 and S at5? Then S would be in the word and at position5? But then if we guessed S at5, it should have been marked as correct? Only if position5 is S? But we were told S is at wrong position? So S cannot be at5. Therefore, if the word has two S's, one at5 would be correct? So we must have S not duplicated? Meaning that S is only at one position? 

Therefore, in Option A, if we have S at1, then S at5 cannot be? So the pattern S I R E ? must have the fifth letter not S? So SIRED is a possibility? Yes, D is not forbidden? D hasn't been guessed. But in ""ripes"" we had E at4, so E is there? And D is new.

Similarly, SIREN? But we know N is not in the word? From first guess? N is out. So SIREN is not possible.

Also, SIR?E? Only SIRED? But what about SIREE? Not a common word? 

But now Option B1: S I X E R? That is, S at1, I at2, X at3, E at4, R at5? This meets the constraints. Words: SIVER? Not a word. SIDER? Not commonly used? Or SIXER? S-I-X-E-R? Sixer is a word? It means a hit in cricket? Ok.

Option B2: X I S E R? Words: WISER? Or MISER? Or RISER? But R is at position5? But we know R is already in the word? But in Option B2, R is at position5? And not duplicated? So WORDS: any 5-letter word ending with SER? With I at2 and E at4? Actually: _ I S E R? 
Common words: MISER, RISER, but R is at position5? And also at position1? If we choose MISER: M-I-S-E-R? But then we have S at position3? That's Option B2? 

Wait: RISER: R-I-S-E-R? Then we have R at position1 and position5? Duplicate R? We don't know if duplicates are allowed? In previous feedback, we haven't ruled out duplicates? 
- But in our feedback for ""ripes"": R was guessed at position1 and marked as wrong position? If the word has R at position5 and does not have R at position1, then it would be marked as wrong position? So that's consistent.
- However, if the word has R at position1 and position5? Then when we guess R at position1, if there is a duplicate R? The feedback might be that the first R is correct? Or it might depend? Actually, in Wordle rules, duplicates are handled by: if a letter is duplicated and you guess it in a position where it exists, it gets ✓. If you guess it more times than it exists, then extras are x. But here, for ""ripes"", if the secret word had R only at position5 (not at1), then R at1 should be marked as -. If it had R at1 and not at5? Then it would be ✓? But we got -, so if there was duplicate R? Then let's say secret word has R at1 and R at5? Then we guess R at1: it would be ✓? So since we got - for R at1 in ""ripes"", it means the secret word has R but not at position1? So there is no R at position1? Therefore, we can have only one R? Or duplicates elsewhere? But we haven't seen duplicates.

So to avoid complications, we will assume no duplicates? Or the word does not have duplicate R? 

Similarly for S: in ""ripes"", S at5 was marked as wrong position? That means the secret word does not have S at position5? So if there is a duplicate S, we still know S is not at5? So we don't care.

Now back to Option B2: pattern X I S E R? Examples: MISER? M is not forbidden? R at5? 
But note: we have R at5? But in Option B2, the letter at position1 is X? And must be a letter that is not C,A,N,P? And hasn't been guessed? And words: MISER, RISER? But RISER: R at1? But we know there is no R at1? Because in ""ripes"" R at1 was marked as wrong position? But if R is at5 and we are considering Option B2, having R at1 is not possible? Because that would require duplicate R? So RISER wouldn't work? Unless duplicate R? But we know from ""ripes"" that position1 is not R? So RISER has R at1? Which would be wrong? So not possible? And also, RISER has R at1 and R at5? Duplicate? So the pattern for Option B2 must be: let's say position1 is a non-R letter? Like MISER: M-I-S-E-R? Then R at5? And M is a new letter? Not guessed before? Similarly, VISER? Not a word? WISER? W-I-S-E-R? But WISER is a word? 

WISER? But then S at position3? And W at1? 

Similarly, for Option B1: pattern S I X E R? Words: SIVER? Not common? SIZER? S-I-Z-E-R? But Z? Not common? SIDER? S-I-D-E-R? SIDER is not common? But we can try.

We need to guess a word that helps us differentiate between these cases? 

We can try to guess a word that has the pattern that fits either Option A or Option B? 

But let's list possible words we can use for the next guess? 

We must meet:
- Position2: I
- Position4: E
- We know R and S are in the word? So we must include them? Or we can omit one? But we are allowed to make any valid word? But to get information, we should include them?

To test between Option A and Option B? 

Let me form a guess that:

Case A: the word should be S I R E X? For example, we can guess ""sired"" to test? But then if we guess ""sired"", and it is the word, we win? If not, then we know Option A is not happening? But we haven't guessed all possibilities? 

But we have many options? 

Alternatively, we can guess a word that puts S at position1 and R at position5? That would force Option B1? For example, guess ""siker""? But let's check.

We can guess a word that uses only allowed letters and tests positions.

We know:

We must test position1: is it S? 
We must test position3: could be R or S or unknown?
We must test position5: could be R or unknown?

So let's form a word that has:

We know position2=I, position4=E? So we set I at2 and E at4? And we choose letters for positions 1,3,5.

To test multiple cases? 

For example, if we guess a word with S at position1 and R at position3? But that is the Option A pattern? Then if correct, we get ✓ for both? But if the word is actually Option B, then we get different feedback.

We can try ""SIREN""? But we know N is out? So invalid.

Alternatively, ""SIRED""? 
Letters: S, I, R, E, D -> and we haven't used D? 

So if we guess ""sired"":
- Pattern: S I R E D
- If the secret word is Option A: S I R E X? Then if X is D, we win? Otherwise, we get feedback that D is not in the word? Or at wrong position? 
But even if X is not D, we have S at1 and R at3? If Option A is true, then S at1 would be ✓? R at3 would be ✓? But E at4? I at2? And D? Would be feedback for D: new letter? It could be ✓ or x.

But if Option B is true? For example, Option B1: the word is S I X E R? So positions: S at1? That would be ✓? I at2✓? But R at3? In Option B1, R is at5? So at position3 would be X? So if we guess R at3, and the secret has no R at3? Then R would be marked as ? Well, we know R is in the word? If the secret word has R at5? Then our guess has R at3? The feedback would be for R: - (since it's in the word but not at3)? And also, we guess position5: D? And the secret has R at5? So D at5 is x? 

Similarly, if Option B2: word is MISER? Then we guess S I R E D? Then position1: S? Secret is M? So x? But wait: secret has S at position3? So S is in the word? Position1: S? So feedback for S: since secret has S, but at position3? And not at1? So marked as -? Position2: I? Secret has I? ✓? Position3: R? Secret has S? So R? We know R is in the secret? But at position5? So R at3 should be marked as present? -? Position4: E, ✓? Position5: D? Secret has R? So x?

But then we will get feedback with ✓ for I and E? - for S and R? And x for D? Which doesn't help us distinguish? 

So let's avoid a direct overlap? 

Alternatively, we can guess a word that has:
- The unknown letter? 
- And tests positions.

We know the secret must have one of:
- Option A: S I R E ?
- Option B1: S I ? E R
- Option B2: ? I S E R

But we have only 4 options? Or one more? 

We can guess a word that doesn't include R or S? To test for the unknown letter? But R and S are required? So we cannot avoid? Or we can avoid? But we know R and S are in the word? But if we exclude them, we might get feedback that R is not at the position? But we already know R and S are in the word? So it's better to include them?

We have to use the known letters: R, S, I, E? Actually I and E are fixed? So the word must have I at2 and E at4? So our guess must have I at2 and E at4? And then we choose 1,3,5 with allowed letters.

We also must include R and S? Because they are in the secret? So should include them? But we are not forced? The guess is not required to have R and S? But if we don't, then we will get feedback that R is missing? But we know R is in the secret? Or no? The feedback may show R as missing? But then we would know we didn't include R? But that doesn't help? So better to include them.

So our guess should include R and S? And have I at2 and E at4?

So pattern: _ I _ E _
With only three spots: 1,3,5 to fill? But we have to include two more letters: R and S? And one of them might fill one spot? But we have three spots? And only need two letters? That implies that one letter will be used in two positions? Or we have duplicate?

But we can choose a letter for the third spot that is new? 

So let's choose letters for position1,3,5.

We need at least R and S to appear in positions 1,3,5 or ... But positions 1,3,5 are the only ones? 

So we have to put R and S somewhere in the three positions? And the third position can be a new letter? 

Now, based on the options:

In Option A: positions: 1=S, 3=R, 5?
In Option B1: positions: 1=S, 3=?, 5=R
In Option B2: positions: 1=?, 3=S, 5=R

For our guess, we assign positions for S and R.

We want to test the positions? So perhaps put S at position1 and R at position3? 

Guess: S I R E X? With X being a new letter? For example, ""sired""? 

But let me see what other options? 

Or we can put S at position1 and R at position5: guess S I ? E R? With the middle letter chosen? For example, with T? ""siter""? Not a word? With D: ""sider""? Not common? With M: ""simer""? Not a word?

Or S at position3 and R at position5: guess ? I S E R? So words: miser, wiser, riser, liser? But riser: R at1? But forbidden because no R at1? So miser, wiser? 

So for the guess, we can try:

Option for our guess: ""sired"" -> S I R E D
- We test: position1=S, position3=R

Or we can try ""miser"" -> M I S E R? Position3=S, position5=R

Or ""wiser"" -> W I S E R

Or if we put S at1 and R at5: we need a word: S I (letter at3) E R? For example, with letter T? ""siter"" not common? With L: ""siler""? Not common? 

Let me list valid English words:

For pattern _ I _ E _:
- With S at1 and R at3: ""sired"" (meaning served as a sire), ""siren"" but N out? ""siree"" not common? 
So ""sired"" is a valid option.

For pattern _ I ? E R? With S at1: 
- With the third letter? Words: ""sider"" not common? ""siker""? Not common? ""siver""? No? 
There may not be common words with S at1 and R at5? 

For pattern _ I S E R: words: ""miser"", ""wiser"", ""riser"" (but R at1 not possible? But ""riser"" has R at1? It's not allowed? So not that? So ""miser"", ""wiser""? 

Also, ""fiser""? Not common.

To choose, we want to test as many new letters as possible? 

Guess ""sired"":
- Uses D as new letter.
- If secret word is Option A? Then S at1? ✓? R at3? ✓? Then we have I and E✓, and D at5? If secret's fifth letter is D? Then all good? If not, then we know it's another letter?
- If secret word is Option B1? Then S at1? ✓? I? ✓? R at3? But secret has R at5? And not at3? So R is in the word? But not at3? So R at3 will be marked as -? Then E✓? D at5? x? So we get S✓, I✓, R(-), E✓, D(x) ? 
- But our third position guess is R? But secret's third position is X? Which is not R? So R? Feedback: because R is in the secret? But not at position3? So it would be marked with -? Yes? 

Also, for Option B2? Secret: X I S E R? Guess: S I R E D? 
Then: position1: S? secret has M? If X is not S? But S is in the secret at position3? So S at1: marked as - (because not at1)? 
Position2: I✓? 
Position3: R? But secret has S at3? So we are guessing R? Which is in the secret? But at position5? So R at3: marked as -? 
Position4: E✓? 
Position5: D? x? 

So feedback: S(-), I✓, R(-), E✓, D(x)

Now, comparing, for Option A: we get 4✓ and one? For Option A with X=D: all✓? For Option A with X not D: then D is x? And other positions would be? Positions 1,2,3,4 should be✓? Because in Option A, position1=S, 2=I, 3=R, 4=E? And position5 is not D? So feedback: S✓, I✓, R✓, E✓, D(x)? 

For Option B1: 
We get: S? position1=S? And secret has S at1? So S✓? I at2✓? R at3? But secret has X at3? So R is at5? So R at3: -? Position4=E✓? Position5=D? But secret has R? So D at5: x? But R is still in the word? So we must see the feedback for R? 

So for case B1: 
- S (position1)✓ because correct.
- I (2)✓
- R (3): present but not at3? Marked as -? 
- E (4)✓? 
- D (5): x? 

So the feedback would be: S(✓) I(✓) R(-) E(✓) D(x)? 

Similarly, Option B2: we get: S at1? Secret has no S at1? But S is in the secret at3? So S at1: marked as -? 
I at2:✓?
R at3? Marked as - because R is not at3? But is in the secret at5? 
E at4:✓? 
D at5: x? 

So same feedback: S(-) I(✓) R(-) E(✓) D(x) 

But in Option A, if X is not D, we get: S(✓) I(✓) R(✓) E(✓) D(x) 

The difference is only in the position of R? 

Specifically, if we guess ""sired"":
- If we get R at position3 as ✓? Then Option A is correct? 
- If we get R at position3 as -? Then Option A is false? Then it's Option B? And the word is that R is not at3? So R must be at5? 

And also, S at1? If we get S at1 as✓? Then it's Option A or Option B1? But in Option B1, S at1 is✓? In Option B2, S at1 is -? 

But in the feedback for Option B1 and B2? For ""sired"", in B1: S at1 is✓ (because Option B1 has S at1)? In B2: S at1 is not the correct letter? So -? 

Therefore, to distinguish:

If we guess ""sired"":
- If S at position1 is ✓ and R at position3 is ✓, then secret word is S I R E D? We win? 
- If S at position1 is ✓ and R at position3 is -, then we know it's Option B1? Because S at1 is✓? So the secret is S I (X) E R? We then know positions: 1=S? 2=I? 4=E? 5=R? And position3? Only missing is position3? Then we can guess the next time? 
- If S at position1 is - and R at position3 is -, then Option B2? Because in B2, S is not at1? And R is not at3? So secret is (X) I S E R? 

Therefore, with one guess, we can distinguish all cases? 

So ""sired"" is a good candidate for the guess. 

But what about non-English words? ""Sired"" is valid: past tense of sire? Or to father offspring? 

We also have the option to guess ""miser"" for example? Let me see if there is a better word? 

But with ""sired"", we have these benefits: 
- It tests S at1? And R at3? 
- It includes all required letters? And uses a new letter D? 
- It covers multiple cases? 

So why not? 

But let's confirm the letters we have used? Avoid multiple? 
We haven't used D? 

So I will go with ""sired"". 

Guess: ""sired"" 

<guess>sired</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

1. **crane** → C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)  
   - Letters **C**, **A**, **N** are **absent**.  
   - **R** and **E** are present but not in positions 2 or 5.  

2. **ripes** → R(-) I(✓) P(x) E(✓) S(-)  
   - **I** is **correct at position 2**.  
   - **E** is **correct at position 4**.  
   - **R** is present (wrong position, not 1).  
   - **S** is present (wrong position, not 5).  
   - **P** is absent.  

### Deductions:
- **Fixed positions**:  
  - Position 2: **I**  
  - Position 4: **E**  
  - Secret word pattern: `_ I _ E _`  
- **Present letters**: **R**, **S** (but not at positions 1 or 5 for R; not at 5 for S).  
- **Absent letters**: **C**, **A**, **N**, **P**.  
- **Possible positions for R**: 3 or 5 (cannot be 1, 2, or 4).  
- **Possible positions for S**: 1 or 3 (cannot be 2, 4, or 5).  
- **Unknown letter**: One new letter (not yet tested) in the remaining position, since duplicates are unlikely given feedback.  

### Plan:
- **Test S at position 1 and R at position 3** with a word that fits `_ I _ E _`.  
- **Key candidates**:  
  - `S I R E _` (e.g., **sired**, if the fifth letter is D).  
  - Alternative patterns (if R is at 5): `S I _ E R` or `_ I S E R`.  
- **Goal**: Differentiate between cases by verifying positions of R and S.  

### Selected Guess: **sired**
- **Reasoning**:  
  - Tests S at position 1 (✓ if correct; ✗/— or x otherwise).  
  - Tests R at position 3 (✓ if correct; — otherwise).  
  - Uses **D** (new letter) to test position 5.  
  - Feedback will resolve ambiguity:
    - If S(✓) and R(✓), secret is **sired** (win).  
    - If S(✓) and R(—), secret likely fits `S I _ E R` (e.g., B1 case).  
    - If S(—) and R(—), secret likely fits `_ I S E R` (e.g., B2 case like **miser**).  
- Avoids forbidden letters **(C, A, N, P)** and reuses known present letters **(R, S)**.

Common letters include: S, T, L, O, U, D, G, H, I, etc.\n\n We know R must be in the word, but not at position 2. So R can be at positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: in the feedback, we had R at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So R is in the word but not at position 2.\n\n Similarly, E is in the word but not at position 5.\n\n We also know that the word does not have C, A, N.\n\n Let\'s try to think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N.\n\n We can try a word that puts R in a different position and E in a different position.\n\n For example, we might try to put R at position 1 and E at position 3? Or other positions.\n\n But note: we don\'t know the exact positions yet.\n\n We can also consider that the word might have other common letters.\n\n Let\'s try the word ""ROLES"" as a possibility? But wait, we have to avoid A, C, N, and we haven\'t used O, L, S.\n\n However, note that in the feedback, we have R and E present. But we must also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? The rules don\'t say anything about duplicate letters, but typically in Wordle, words can have duplicates. However, the feedback for ""crane"" didn\'t show any duplicate, so we don\'t have evidence of duplicates yet.\n\n But let\'s check: if we use ""ROLES"":\n - R at position 1: if the secret word has R at position 1, then it would be marked as correct (✓). But in our feedback, R was in the word but not at position 2, so it could be at position 1? Actually, yes, it could be at position 1.\n\n However, we don\'t know if R is at position 1 or not. So we can try a word that has R in a position we haven\'t tried and E in a position we haven\'t tried.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has as many new letters as possible to get more information.\n\n Let me think of a word that includes R and E, and uses three new letters.\n\n Some possibilities: \n - ""RICES"" -> but C is not allowed (we know C is not in the word) and also we have C in the word which is already known to be absent? So we cannot use C.\n\n We must avoid C, A, N.\n\n So let\'s try: ""ROUTE"", ""RISES"", ""ROBES"", ""RULES"", ""RIPES"", ""ROGUE"", etc.\n\n But note: we also want to test other common letters. Let\'s try to include S, T, L, etc.\n\n Another idea: we can try ""STORE"". But let\'s check:\n - S: new\n - T: new\n - O: new\n - R: we know it\'s in the word, but we are putting it at position 4? \n - E: we know it\'s in the word, but we are putting it at position 5? But wait, in the first guess, E was at position 5 and was marked as wrong position. So E cannot be at position 5. Therefore, we cannot put E at position 5 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it\'s not at position 5. So we should avoid putting E at position 5.\n\n Therefore, we should avoid putting E at the fifth position and R at the second position.\n\n So for ""STORE"": \n - R is at position 4 -> that\'s a new position for R, so it might be correct or not.\n - E is at position 5 -> but we know E is not at position 5, so it would be marked as present but wrong position again? We don\'t get new information about E\'s position? Actually, we would get that E is not at position 5 (which we already know) and we don\'t learn about other positions.\n\n So we should try to put E in a different position, say position 2, 3, or 4.\n\n Similarly, R should be in a position that is not 2. We can try position 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\n Let me try to form a word that has R at position 1 and E at position 3? For example: ""RESTY"" (if we allow Y). But we need to make sure it\'s a valid word.\n\n Alternatively, ""RESET"" has duplicate E? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. We should avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.\n\n How about ""ROBES""? \n - R at 1, O at 2, B at 3, E at 4, S at 5.\n But note: we are putting E at position 4? That\'s a new position. And R at position 1? That\'s a new position.\n\n However, we have to avoid using letters we know are absent: C, A, N. ""ROBES"" uses R, O, B, E, S. None of these are C, A, N. So it\'s okay.\n\n But wait: what if the secret word has O? We don\'t know. We are testing O and B and S.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""RIPEN"" but N is not allowed. So we cannot use N.\n\n Another word: ""RIPED""? Not a word. ""RIPES"" is a word? Yes, meaning to tear or pull.\n\n ""RIPES"": \n - R at 1, I at 2, P at 3, E at 4, S at 5.\n\n This avoids the forbidden letters and puts R at a new position (1) and E at a new position (4). Also, we test I, P, S.\n\n But note: in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was present but wrong. So if we put R at position 1, and if the secret word has R at position 1, we\'ll get a ✓. If not, then we\'ll get a - (if R is elsewhere) or x (if R is not at 1) but we know R is in the word so it would be - if not at 1.\n\n Similarly, E at position 4: if the secret word has E at position 4, we get ✓, else we get - (since we know E is in the word).\n\n However, we are also testing I at position 2 and P at position 3 and S at position 5.\n\n But wait: we know that the secret word does not have A, C, N. So we are safe.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in the middle? \n\n Another common word: ""DRIVE"" -> but D is new, R at position 2? We cannot put R at position 2 because we already know that position 2 is not R. So we should avoid position 2 for R? Actually, we can put R at position 2 again? But we know it\'s not there, so it would be marked as present but wrong position again? That doesn\'t give new information. So we should avoid putting R at position 2.\n\n Therefore, ""DRIVE"" is not good because R is at position 2.\n\n How about ""DRUPE""? (a kind of fruit) -> R at position 3? and E at position 5? But we know E is not at position 5. So we avoid E at 5.\n\n Let me think of a word that has E at position 3: for example, ""CRWTH"" is not common and has C. Avoid.\n\n Another: ""TREES"" -> duplicate E? and E at position 5? Avoid.\n\n How about ""STREP""? \n - S at 1, T at 2, R at 3, E at 4, P at 5.\n This puts R at position 3 (new) and E at position 4 (new). And we test S, T, P.\n\n But note: we are putting R at position 3 and E at position 4. Also, we avoid forbidden letters.\n\n However, we are using 5 new letters: S, T, R, E, P. But we already know R and E are in the word, so we are testing S, T, P.\n\n This seems good.\n\n But wait: we are not using the fact that we can put R at position 1? We might get more information by trying R at position 1.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""ROUSE"": \n - R at 1, O at 2, U at 3, S at 4, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is not allowed? We know E is not at 5, so we avoid.\n\n How about ""ROUSE"" is not good because of E at 5.\n\n Then let me try ""ROBES"" again: \n - R at 1, O at 2, B at 3, E at 4, S at 5 -> E at 4? That\'s good.\n\n But we are putting E at 4, which is a new position.\n\n Alternatively, ""RULES"": \n - R at 1, U at 2, L at 3, E at 4, S at 5 -> same as above, E at 4.\n\n But we are testing U and L.\n\n I think ""RULES"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters and we haven\'t tried U and L.\n\n However, we might also consider ""ROUTE"": \n - R at 1, O at 2, U at 3, T at 4, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is not allowed.\n\n So we avoid.\n\n Another word: ""RIPES"" (as I thought earlier) or ""RISES"" (but S at 5? and we have two S\'s? ""RISES"" has two S\'s? Actually, it\'s R-I-S-E-S -> so two S\'s? That might not be ideal because we are testing fewer letters.\n\n We want to test as many new letters as possible. So words with 5 distinct letters are better.\n\n ""RIPES"" has distinct letters: R, I, P, E, S.\n\n So does ""RULES"": R, U, L, E, S.\n\n Both are good.\n\n But note: we already know R and E are in the word, so we are testing I, P, S in ""RIPES"" and U, L, S in ""RULES"".\n\n Since we have limited tries, we want to maximize the chance of hitting the correct letters and also get position information.\n\n I think I\'ll go with ""RIPES"" because it uses I and P which are common.\n\n But let me check: we have to avoid A, C, N. So ""RIPES"" is safe.\n\n So my second guess: ""RIPES""\n\n We\'ll see:\n - If R is at position 1: we get ✓ or - (if not at 1, but we know it\'s in the word so it would be -)\n - I at position 2: we don\'t know, so we get feedback.\n - P at position 3: feedback.\n - E at position 4: if E is at 4, we get ✓, else - (because E is in the word)\n - S at position 5: feedback.\n\n This will give us more information.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t put R at the beginning? But we don\'t know where R is. We are trying to find the position.\n\n But we have to try R in a new position. We tried position 2 (in ""crane"") and now we try position 1. We can also try position 3, 4, or 5 in future guesses.\n\n So I think ""RIPES"" is a good guess.\n\n Let me write it: R I P E S\n\n But wait: what if the secret word has R at position 1? Then we get a ✓ and we know the first letter. That would be great.\n\n If not, then we know R is not at position 1 and we can try other positions.\n\n So I\'ll go with ""RIPES"".\n\n<guess>ripes</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C, A, N** are **not** in the secret word.\n- **R** is in the word but **not in position 2**.\n- **E** is in the word but **not in position 5**.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Avoid **C, A, N** entirely.\n- Include **R** and **E**, but place them in new positions (not position 2 for R, not position 5 for E).\n- Test new common letters (**I, P, S**) to gather more information.\n- Prioritize distinct letters to maximize coverage.\n\nThe word **""RIPES""** fits these criteria:\n- Places **R** at position 1 (new position, could be correct or reveal another location).\n- Places **E** at position 4 (new position, avoids position 5).\n- Tests **I** (position 2), **P** (position 3), and **S** (position 5) for the first time.\n- Uses no forbidden letters (C, A, N) and no duplicates.\n\nThis guess will efficiently narrow down possible positions for R and E while checking three new letters.\n\n<guess>ripes</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: ripes -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(✓) P(x) E(✓) S(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nFirst guess: ""crane""\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: - (in the word, but wrong position)\n- A: x (not in the word)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: - (in the word, but wrong position)\n\nSecond guess: ""ripes""\n- R: - (in the word, but wrong position) -> note: in ""ripes"", R is at position 1, so the secret word has R but not at position 1.\n- I: ✓ (correct letter and position) -> so position 2 is I.\n- P: x (not in the word)\n- E: ✓ (correct letter and position) -> so position 4 is E.\n- S: - (in the word, but wrong position) -> so S is in the word, but not at position 5.\n\nWe now know:\n- The secret word has: R, I (at position 2), E (at position 4), and S (but not at position 5). Also, from the first guess, we know E is in the word (now confirmed at position 4) and R is in the word (but not at position 1 or 2).\n- Letters not in the word: C, A, N, P (and from ""crane"": C, A, N; from ""ripes"": P). Also, from ""crane"", we had E not at 5, which is consistent because now E is at 4.\n\nThe current known positions:\n- Position 2: I (fixed)\n- Position 4: E (fixed)\n\nWe also have:\n- R is in the word, but not at position 1 (from ""ripes"") and not at position 2 (from ""crane"", and position 2 is I). So R must be at position 3 or 5? Because position 4 is E, so R can be at 3 or 5? Or at position 1? But we just guessed R at position 1 and it was wrong position, so R is not at 1. Similarly, not at 2. So positions available: 3 or 5? But note: positions are 1 to 5. We haven\'t tried position 3 or 5 for R.\n\nBut wait: the word might have more than five letters? No, it\'s a 5-letter word. So R must be at one of the other positions: 3 or 5? But position 4 is E, so R can be at 3 or 5? Yes.\n\nAlso, S is in the word but not at position 5 (from ""ripes"" feedback). So S can be at position 1 or 3? Because positions: 1, 2(I), 3, 4(E), 5. And S cannot be at position 5. Also, we don\'t know where S is exactly.\n\nWe also know that R must be at position 3 or 5, and S must be at position 1 or 3? But if R is at 3 and S at 3, that\'s impossible. So S can only be at position 1 (if R is at 3 or 5) or at position 3 only if R is not at 3? But R cannot be at S\'s position. So:\n\n- If R is at position 3, then S must be at position 1 (since position 5 is open but S cannot be at 5? Wait: no, position 5 is available for S? But in the feedback for ""ripes"", S was at position 5 and marked as wrong position? So S cannot be at 5. Therefore, S can only be at position 1 or 3.\n\nBut if R is at position 3, then S cannot be at 3 (same position). So then S must be at 1.\n\nIf R is at position 5, then S could be at position 1 or 3.\n\nSo we have two main cases:\n\nCase 1: R at 3, then S must be at 1.\nCase 2: R at 5, then S can be at 1 or 3.\n\nAdditionally, we have one more letter to determine: the letter at position 5 in Case 1 is unknown? Or position 3 in Case 2? \n\nThe word structure:\n- Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 -> known: 2=I, 4=E.\n- Letters: R and S are in the word, and one more letter because we have 5 letters: we have R, I, E, S, and one more unknown letter that hasn\'t been guessed yet.\n\nWe have used: from ""crane"": C,R,A,N,E -> so we know C,A,N are out; from ""ripes"": R,I,P,E,S -> P is out.\n\nSo the unknown letter must be a letter that hasn\'t been guessed: we have guessed letters: C, R, A, N, E, I, P, S.\n\nSo we have tried: C, R, A, N, E, I, P, S.\n\nTherefore, the secret word has: R, I, E, S, and one more letter not in {C, A, N, P} and not E,R,I,S (so a new letter).\n\nSo the fifth letter is a new letter, say X, that hasn\'t been guessed.\n\nSo the word is: [position1] , I (at 2), [position3], E (at 4), [position5]\n\nAnd we know:\n- The word contains R and S (so either R is at position 3 or 5, and S is at position 1 or 3, but cannot conflict).\n\nNow, let\'s think about the possibilities:\n\nOption A: Position3 = R, then Position1 must be S (since S cannot be at 5, and 3 is taken by R). Then Position5 must be the other letter, X.\n\nSo the word: S, I, R, E, X? But then we have the word as S I R E X? And X is not R or S (but R is at 3) and not E,I. So X is the fifth letter.\n\nBut R is at position 3? That would be the third letter. And S at position 1.\n\nBut in this case, what about the R feedback in previous guesses? \n- In ""crane"": R was guessed at position 2, which is wrong. And the secret word has R at position 3? Then the feedback for ""crane"" would be for R: marked as present but wrong position? Correct because position 3 is not 2.\n- In ""ripes"": R was at position 1 and marked as wrong position? Correct because R is at position 3.\n\nSimilarly, S: in ""ripes"" S was at position 5 and marked as wrong position? But in this option, S is at position 1, which is not 5? So that matches.\n\nNow, Option B: Position5 = R, then S can be at position 1 or 3? \n- If S at position 1: then word: S, I, ?, E, R -> with the third position being the unknown letter X?\n- If S at position 3: then word: ?, I, S, [E? position4], R -> position1 must be X? But then the word: X, I, S, E, R.\n\nAlso, in both subcases, we need to check the feedback.\n\nBut we must also consider the S from feedback: S is in the word. So it must be placed.\n\nNow, to choose the next guess, we need to test between these possibilities.\n\nBut note: we know position 4 is E and position 2 is I, so we have:\n\nOption A: word = S I R E X? \nOption B1: word = S I X? E R? \nOption B2: word = X I S E R? \n\nBut we also need to find X? \n\nActually, we should form a guess that can help differentiate these possibilities.\n\nMoreover, we need to include R and S because we know they are in the word? But we don\'t have to? Actually, we can use a word that has both? Or we can try to hit the possibilities.\n\nBut note: in Option A, R is at position3, so if we guess a word with R at position3, and if it is correct, we get ✓ for R at 3. Similarly, for other positions.\n\nWe can try to test a word that puts R at position3 and another at position5? But we cannot do both.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to use a word that has the S at position1 or position3? \n\nLet me think of words that fit the known information.\n\nWe know the word has the pattern: _ I _ E _ \nWith the constraints:\n- Position1: either S (in Option A) or other (in Option B, it\'s either S or X)\n- Position3: either R (in Option A) or S or X (in Option B: in B1 position3 is X, not S; in B2 position3 is S)\n- Position5: either X (in Option A) or R (in B1 and B2? In B1: R is at5? Option B1: S I X E R -> position5=R; Option B2: X I S E R -> position5=R) \nSo in both Option B, position5=R? Because we are putting R at5? So only Option A has R at position3? \n\nActually, in Option B: we have R at position5? So in Option A: position3=R, position5=X? In Option B: position5=R and position3 can be either S or X? \n\nBut X is the unknown letter? So:\n\nTo summarize:\n- Pattern: _ I _ E _\n- Must contain R and S? Because we know from feedback that R and S are in the word.\n\nIn Option A: position1 = S, position3 = R, position5 = X (unknown)\nIn Option B1: position1 = S, position3 = X (unknown), position5 = R\nIn Option B2: position1 = X (unknown), position3 = S, position5 = R\n\nNow, the unknown X must be a letter not in the forbidden list (C, A, N, P) and not E, I, R, S? (because we are using distinct letters? But wait, what if there are duplicates? We don\'t know. But we haven\'t encountered duplicates yet, so we assume no duplicates.)\n\nAdditionally, the word must be a valid English word.\n\nWe can try to form words for these patterns and see which are possible? \n\nFor Option A: pattern: S I R E ? -> possible words? We need words starting with SIRE? \nCommon words: \n- SIRED? But that is 5 letters? S-I-R-E-D -> SIRED is a word? Yes, past tense of sire.\n- SIRE? But that is 4 letters? So we need 5: SIRED? \n- SIRES? But positions: S at1, I at2, R at3, E at4, S at5? But duplicate S? We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? And we had S in feedback from ""ripes"" as present but wrong position? So if we have two S, it\'s possible? But in ""ripes"", we guessed S at5 and it was marked as wrong position? If the word has S at1 and S at5? Then S would be in the word and at position5? But then if we guessed S at5, it should have been marked as correct? Only if position5 is S? But we were told S is at wrong position? So S cannot be at5. Therefore, if the word has two S\'s, one at5 would be correct? So we must have S not duplicated? Meaning that S is only at one position? \n\nTherefore, in Option A, if we have S at1, then S at5 cannot be? So the pattern S I R E ? must have the fifth letter not S? So SIRED is a possibility? Yes, D is not forbidden? D hasn\'t been guessed. But in ""ripes"" we had E at4, so E is there? And D is new.\n\nSimilarly, SIREN? But we know N is not in the word? From first guess? N is out. So SIREN is not possible.\n\nAlso, SIR?E? Only SIRED? But what about SIREE? Not a common word? \n\nBut now Option B1: S I X E R? That is, S at1, I at2, X at3, E at4, R at5? This meets the constraints. Words: SIVER? Not a word. SIDER? Not commonly used? Or SIXER? S-I-X-E-R? Sixer is a word? It means a hit in cricket? Ok.\n\nOption B2: X I S E R? Words: WISER? Or MISER? Or RISER? But R is at position5? But we know R is already in the word? But in Option B2, R is at position5? And not duplicated? So WORDS: any 5-letter word ending with SER? With I at2 and E at4? Actually: _ I S E R? \nCommon words: MISER, RISER, but R is at position5? And also at position1? If we choose MISER: M-I-S-E-R? But then we have S at position3? That\'s Option B2? \n\nWait: RISER: R-I-S-E-R? Then we have R at position1 and position5? Duplicate R? We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? In previous feedback, we haven\'t ruled out duplicates? \n- But in our feedback for ""ripes"": R was guessed at position1 and marked as wrong position? If the word has R at position5 and does not have R at position1, then it would be marked as wrong position? So that\'s consistent.\n- However, if the word has R at position1 and position5? Then when we guess R at position1, if there is a duplicate R? The feedback might be that the first R is correct? Or it might depend? Actually, in Wordle rules, duplicates are handled by: if a letter is duplicated and you guess it in a position where it exists, it gets ✓. If you guess it more times than it exists, then extras are x. But here, for ""ripes"", if the secret word had R only at position5 (not at1), then R at1 should be marked as -. If it had R at1 and not at5? Then it would be ✓? But we got -, so if there was duplicate R? Then let\'s say secret word has R at1 and R at5? Then we guess R at1: it would be ✓? So since we got - for R at1 in ""ripes"", it means the secret word has R but not at position1? So there is no R at position1? Therefore, we can have only one R? Or duplicates elsewhere? But we haven\'t seen duplicates.\n\nSo to avoid complications, we will assume no duplicates? Or the word does not have duplicate R? \n\nSimilarly for S: in ""ripes"", S at5 was marked as wrong position? That means the secret word does not have S at position5? So if there is a duplicate S, we still know S is not at5? So we don\'t care.\n\nNow back to Option B2: pattern X I S E R? Examples: MISER? M is not forbidden? R at5? \nBut note: we have R at5? But in Option B2, the letter at position1 is X? And must be a letter that is not C,A,N,P? And hasn\'t been guessed? And words: MISER, RISER? But RISER: R at1? But we know there is no R at1? Because in ""ripes"" R at1 was marked as wrong position? But if R is at5 and we are considering Option B2, having R at1 is not possible? Because that would require duplicate R? So RISER wouldn\'t work? Unless duplicate R? But we know from ""ripes"" that position1 is not R? So RISER has R at1? Which would be wrong? So not possible? And also, RISER has R at1 and R at5? Duplicate? So the pattern for Option B2 must be: let\'s say position1 is a non-R letter? Like MISER: M-I-S-E-R? Then R at5? And M is a new letter? Not guessed before? Similarly, VISER? Not a word? WISER? W-I-S-E-R? But WISER is a word? \n\nWISER? But then S at position3? And W at1? \n\nSimilarly, for Option B1: pattern S I X E R? Words: SIVER? Not common? SIZER? S-I-Z-E-R? But Z? Not common? SIDER? S-I-D-E-R? SIDER is not common? But we can try.\n\nWe need to guess a word that helps us differentiate between these cases? \n\nWe can try to guess a word that has the pattern that fits either Option A or Option B? \n\nBut let\'s list possible words we can use for the next guess? \n\nWe must meet:\n- Position2: I\n- Position4: E\n- We know R and S are in the word? So we must include them? Or we can omit one? But we are allowed to make any valid word? But to get information, we should include them?\n\nTo test between Option A and Option B? \n\nLet me form a guess that:\n\nCase A: the word should be S I R E X? For example, we can guess ""sired"" to test? But then if we guess ""sired"", and it is the word, we win? If not, then we know Option A is not happening? But we haven\'t guessed all possibilities? \n\nBut we have many options? \n\nAlternatively, we can guess a word that puts S at position1 and R at position5? That would force Option B1? For example, guess ""siker""? But let\'s check.\n\nWe can guess a word that uses only allowed letters and tests positions.\n\nWe know:\n\nWe must test position1: is it S? \nWe must test position3: could be R or S or unknown?\nWe must test position5: could be R or unknown?\n\nSo let\'s form a word that has:\n\nWe know position2=I, position4=E? So we set I at2 and E at4? And we choose letters for positions 1,3,5.\n\nTo test multiple cases? \n\nFor example, if we guess a word with S at position1 and R at position3? But that is the Option A pattern? Then if correct, we get ✓ for both? But if the word is actually Option B, then we get different feedback.\n\nWe can try ""SIREN""? But we know N is out? So invalid.\n\nAlternatively, ""SIRED""? \nLetters: S, I, R, E, D -> and we haven\'t used D? \n\nSo if we guess ""sired"":\n- Pattern: S I R E D\n- If the secret word is Option A: S I R E X? Then if X is D, we win? Otherwise, we get feedback that D is not in the word? Or at wrong position? \nBut even if X is not D, we have S at1 and R at3? If Option A is true, then S at1 would be ✓? R at3 would be ✓? But E at4? I at2? And D? Would be feedback for D: new letter? It could be ✓ or x.\n\nBut if Option B is true? For example, Option B1: the word is S I X E R? So positions: S at1? That would be ✓? I at2✓? But R at3? In Option B1, R is at5? So at position3 would be X? So if we guess R at3, and the secret has no R at3? Then R would be marked as ? Well, we know R is in the word? If the secret word has R at5? Then our guess has R at3? The feedback would be for R: - (since it\'s in the word but not at3)? And also, we guess position5: D? And the secret has R at5? So D at5 is x? \n\nSimilarly, if Option B2: word is MISER? Then we guess S I R E D? Then position1: S? Secret is M? So x? But wait: secret has S at position3? So S is in the word? Position1: S? So feedback for S: since secret has S, but at position3? And not at1? So marked as -? Position2: I? Secret has I? ✓? Position3: R? Secret has S? So R? We know R is in the secret? But at position5? So R at3 should be marked as present? -? Position4: E, ✓? Position5: D? Secret has R? So x?\n\nBut then we will get feedback with ✓ for I and E? - for S and R? And x for D? Which doesn\'t help us distinguish? \n\nSo let\'s avoid a direct overlap? \n\nAlternatively, we can guess a word that has:\n- The unknown letter? \n- And tests positions.\n\nWe know the secret must have one of:\n- Option A: S I R E ?\n- Option B1: S I ? E R\n- Option B2: ? I S E R\n\nBut we have only 4 options? Or one more? \n\nWe can guess a word that doesn\'t include R or S? To test for the unknown letter? But R and S are required? So we cannot avoid? Or we can avoid? But we know R and S are in the word? But if we exclude them, we might get feedback that R is not at the position? But we already know R and S are in the word? So it\'s better to include them?\n\nWe have to use the known letters: R, S, I, E? Actually I and E are fixed? So the word must have I at2 and E at4? So our guess must have I at2 and E at4? And then we choose 1,3,5 with allowed letters.\n\nWe also must include R and S? Because they are in the secret? So should include them? But we are not forced? The guess is not required to have R and S? But if we don\'t, then we will get feedback that R is missing? But we know R is in the secret? Or no? The feedback may show R as missing? But then we would know we didn\'t include R? But that doesn\'t help? So better to include them.\n\nSo our guess should include R and S? And have I at2 and E at4?\n\nSo pattern: _ I _ E _\nWith only three spots: 1,3,5 to fill? But we have to include two more letters: R and S? And one of them might fill one spot? But we have three spots? And only need two letters? That implies that one letter will be used in two positions? Or we have duplicate?\n\nBut we can choose a letter for the third spot that is new? \n\nSo let\'s choose letters for position1,3,5.\n\nWe need at least R and S to appear in positions 1,3,5 or ... But positions 1,3,5 are the only ones? \n\nSo we have to put R and S somewhere in the three positions? And the third position can be a new letter? \n\nNow, based on the options:\n\nIn Option A: positions: 1=S, 3=R, 5?\nIn Option B1: positions: 1=S, 3=?, 5=R\nIn Option B2: positions: 1=?, 3=S, 5=R\n\nFor our guess, we assign positions for S and R.\n\nWe want to test the positions? So perhaps put S at position1 and R at position3? \n\nGuess: S I R E X? With X being a new letter? For example, ""sired""? \n\nBut let me see what other options? \n\nOr we can put S at position1 and R at position5: guess S I ? E R? With the middle letter chosen? For example, with T? ""siter""? Not a word? With D: ""sider""? Not common? With M: ""simer""? Not a word?\n\nOr S at position3 and R at position5: guess ? I S E R? So words: miser, wiser, riser, liser? But riser: R at1? But forbidden because no R at1? So miser, wiser? \n\nSo for the guess, we can try:\n\nOption for our guess: ""sired"" -> S I R E D\n- We test: position1=S, position3=R\n\nOr we can try ""miser"" -> M I S E R? Position3=S, position5=R\n\nOr ""wiser"" -> W I S E R\n\nOr if we put S at1 and R at5: we need a word: S I (letter at3) E R? For example, with letter T? ""siter"" not common? With L: ""siler""? Not common? \n\nLet me list valid English words:\n\nFor pattern _ I _ E _:\n- With S at1 and R at3: ""sired"" (meaning served as a sire), ""siren"" but N out? ""siree"" not common? \nSo ""sired"" is a valid option.\n\nFor pattern _ I ? E R? With S at1: \n- With the third letter? Words: ""sider"" not common? ""siker""? Not common? ""siver""? No? \nThere may not be common words with S at1 and R at5? \n\nFor pattern _ I S E R: words: ""miser"", ""wiser"", ""riser"" (but R at1 not possible? But ""riser"" has R at1? It\'s not allowed? So not that? So ""miser"", ""wiser""? \n\nAlso, ""fiser""? Not common.\n\nTo choose, we want to test as many new letters as possible? \n\nGuess ""sired"":\n- Uses D as new letter.\n- If secret word is Option A? Then S at1? ✓? R at3? ✓? Then we have I and E✓, and D at5? If secret\'s fifth letter is D? Then all good? If not, then we know it\'s another letter?\n- If secret word is Option B1? Then S at1? ✓? I? ✓? R at3? But secret has R at5? And not at3? So R is in the word? But not at3? So R at3 will be marked as -? Then E✓? D at5? x? So we get S✓, I✓, R(-), E✓, D(x) ? \n- But our third position guess is R? But secret\'s third position is X? Which is not R? So R? Feedback: because R is in the secret? But not at position3? So it would be marked with -? Yes? \n\nAlso, for Option B2? Secret: X I S E R? Guess: S I R E D? \nThen: position1: S? secret has M? If X is not S? But S is in the secret at position3? So S at1: marked as - (because not at1)? \nPosition2: I✓? \nPosition3: R? But secret has S at3? So we are guessing R? Which is in the secret? But at position5? So R at3: marked as -? \nPosition4: E✓? \nPosition5: D? x? \n\nSo feedback: S(-), I✓, R(-), E✓, D(x)\n\nNow, comparing, for Option A: we get 4✓ and one? For Option A with X=D: all✓? For Option A with X not D: then D is x? And other positions would be? Positions 1,2,3,4 should be✓? Because in Option A, position1=S, 2=I, 3=R, 4=E? And position5 is not D? So feedback: S✓, I✓, R✓, E✓, D(x)? \n\nFor Option B1: \nWe get: S? position1=S? And secret has S at1? So S✓? I at2✓? R at3? But secret has X at3? So R is at5? So R at3: -? Position4=E✓? Position5=D? But secret has R? So D at5: x? But R is still in the word? So we must see the feedback for R? \n\nSo for case B1: \n- S (position1)✓ because correct.\n- I (2)✓\n- R (3): present but not at3? Marked as -? \n- E (4)✓? \n- D (5): x? \n\nSo the feedback would be: S(✓) I(✓) R(-) E(✓) D(x)? \n\nSimilarly, Option B2: we get: S at1? Secret has no S at1? But S is in the secret at3? So S at1: marked as -? \nI at2:✓?\nR at3? Marked as - because R is not at3? But is in the secret at5? \nE at4:✓? \nD at5: x? \n\nSo same feedback: S(-) I(✓) R(-) E(✓) D(x) \n\nBut in Option A, if X is not D, we get: S(✓) I(✓) R(✓) E(✓) D(x) \n\nThe difference is only in the position of R? \n\nSpecifically, if we guess ""sired"":\n- If we get R at position3 as ✓? Then Option A is correct? \n- If we get R at position3 as -? Then Option A is false? Then it\'s Option B? And the word is that R is not at3? So R must be at5? \n\nAnd also, S at1? If we get S at1 as✓? Then it\'s Option A or Option B1? But in Option B1, S at1 is✓? In Option B2, S at1 is -? \n\nBut in the feedback for Option B1 and B2? For ""sired"", in B1: S at1 is✓ (because Option B1 has S at1)? In B2: S at1 is not the correct letter? So -? \n\nTherefore, to distinguish:\n\nIf we guess ""sired"":\n- If S at position1 is ✓ and R at position3 is ✓, then secret word is S I R E D? We win? \n- If S at position1 is ✓ and R at position3 is -, then we know it\'s Option B1? Because S at1 is✓? So the secret is S I (X) E R? We then know positions: 1=S? 2=I? 4=E? 5=R? And position3? Only missing is position3? Then we can guess the next time? \n- If S at position1 is - and R at position3 is -, then Option B2? Because in B2, S is not at1? And R is not at3? So secret is (X) I S E R? \n\nTherefore, with one guess, we can distinguish all cases? \n\nSo ""sired"" is a good candidate for the guess. \n\nBut what about non-English words? ""Sired"" is valid: past tense of sire? Or to father offspring? \n\nWe also have the option to guess ""miser"" for example? Let me see if there is a better word? \n\nBut with ""sired"", we have these benefits: \n- It tests S at1? And R at3? \n- It includes all required letters? And uses a new letter D? \n- It covers multiple cases? \n\nSo why not? \n\nBut let\'s confirm the letters we have used? Avoid multiple? \nWe haven\'t used D? \n\nSo I will go with ""sired"". \n\nGuess: ""sired"" \n\n<guess>sired</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n1. **crane** → C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)  \n   - Letters **C**, **A**, **N** are **absent**.  \n   - **R** and **E** are present but not in positions 2 or 5.  \n\n2. **ripes** → R(-) I(✓) P(x) E(✓) S(-)  \n   - **I** is **correct at position 2**.  \n   - **E** is **correct at position 4**.  \n   - **R** is present (wrong position, not 1).  \n   - **S** is present (wrong position, not 5).  \n   - **P** is absent.  \n\n### Deductions:\n- **Fixed positions**:  \n  - Position 2: **I**  \n  - Position 4: **E**  \n  - Secret word pattern: `_ I _ E _`  \n- **Present letters**: **R**, **S** (but not at positions 1 or 5 for R; not at 5 for S).  \n- **Absent letters**: **C**, **A**, **N**, **P**.  \n- **Possible positions for R**: 3 or 5 (cannot be 1, 2, or 4).  \n- **Possible positions for S**: 1 or 3 (cannot be 2, 4, or 5).  \n- **Unknown letter**: One new letter (not yet tested) in the remaining position, since duplicates are unlikely given feedback.  \n\n### Plan:\n- **Test S at position 1 and R at position 3** with a word that fits `_ I _ E _`.  \n- **Key candidates**:  \n  - `S I R E _` (e.g., **sired**, if the fifth letter is D).  \n  - Alternative patterns (if R is at 5): `S I _ E R` or `_ I S E R`.  \n- **Goal**: Differentiate between cases by verifying positions of R and S.  \n\n### Selected Guess: **sired**\n- **Reasoning**:  \n  - Tests S at position 1 (✓ if correct; ✗/— or x otherwise).  \n  - Tests R at position 3 (✓ if correct; — otherwise).  \n  - Uses **D** (new letter) to test position 5.  \n  - Feedback will resolve ambiguity:\n    - If S(✓) and R(✓), secret is **sired** (win).  \n    - If S(✓) and R(—), secret likely fits `S I _ E R` (e.g., B1 case).  \n    - If S(—) and R(—), secret likely fits `_ I S E R` (e.g., B2 case like **miser**).  \n- Avoids forbidden letters **(C, A, N, P)** and reuses known present letters **(R, S)**.\n\n<guess>sired</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: ripes -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(✓) P(x) E(✓) S(-)\nGuess 3: sired -> FEEDBACK: S(-) I(✓) R(-) E(✓) D(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for three guesses:

1. ""crane"": 
   - C: x (not in the word)
   - R: - (in the word, but wrong position; not position 2)
   - A: x (not in the word)
   - N: x (not in the word)
   - E: - (in the word, but wrong position; not position 5)

2. ""ripes"":
   - R: - (in the word, but not position 1)
   - I: ✓ (correct letter and position; so position 2 is I)
   - P: x (not in the word)
   - E: ✓ (correct letter and position; so position 4 is E)
   - S: - (in the word, but not position 5)

3. ""sired"":
   - S: - (in the word, but wrong position; not position 1)
   - I: ✓ (position 2 correct)
   - R: - (in the word, but wrong position; not position 3)
   - E: ✓ (position 4 correct)
   - D: x (not in the word)

From this, we know:

- The secret word pattern is: _ I _ E _

- Confirmed letters:
  - Position 2: I
  - Position 4: E

- Other letters in the word:
  - R is present but not at positions 1, 2, 3 (from guesses: positions 1,2,3 tried and not correct)
  - S is present but not at positions 1,5 (positions 1 and 5 tried and not correct)

- Absent letters: C, A, N, P, D

Also, since R has been tried at positions 1,2 and 3 and all were wrong position, remaining positions for R are only 5? Because the word must have R somewhere. Similarly, S has been tried at 1 and 5, wrong positions, so S must be at position 3? 

Positions: 1,2,3,4,5
- Position 2 is I (fixed)
- Position 4 is E (fixed)
- Position 1: tried S in ""sired"" -> not S and not correct? Wait: the feedback for S in ""sired"" was at position 1 and marked as ""-"", meaning S is in the word but not at position 1? So S must be at position 3? Because position 2 is I, position 4 is E, and position 5 was tried with S in ""ripes"" and was not correct? So only position 3 left? 

Similarly, R must be at position 5? Because positions 1,2,3 have been tried? Position 2 is I? So not available? And position 4 is E? So R at position 5? 

But wait, we also have one more letter? The word structure: 

- Position 1: ? (not S? But could be other)
- Position 3: ? (must be S? Since S has to go somewhere and only position 3 left? And S is present)
- Position 5: ? (must be R? Because R has to go somewhere? And only position 5 left? Since 1,2,3 tried? But position 2 and 4 are taken? So R at5?)

But then what about position 1? The secret word has 5 letters? So far, we have: I at 2, E at 4, and S must be at 3, R must be at 5? Then position 1 must be a new letter? 

Also, we know: 
- Letters not in the word: C, A, N, P, D (from feedback)
- Used letters: C,R,A,N,E,I,P,S,D (from the three guesses)

So the secret word must be of the form: position1: a new letter (not C,A,N,P,D,R? But R is at5? So position1 cannot be R? Because positions are distinct? Or position1 could be R? But we tried R at1 already? In ""ripes"", R at1 was marked as ""-"", meaning present? But since position1 was wrong? So R is not at1? 

So the secret word is: 
- Position 1: ? (new letter, let's call it X)
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: S? (because S must be at 3? The only untried position? Not at1? Not at5? And not 2 or4? So must be at3? Because there's only position 3 left? 
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: R? (because R not at1,2,3? So must be at5? 

Is that correct? 

But wait, we haven't tried R at position5? But we know R is in the word? So it must be at5? Similarly, S must be at3? 

Then the word is: X I S E R 

Now, we must find X? And X must be a letter not in the absent list? Absent: C,A,N,P,D? And not R? Also, not I or E since at fixed positions? So new letter? 

We haven't used many letters? For example, B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? Some are less common? 

But we need a valid English word? So words ending with ""ISER"": with I at2, S at3, E at4, R at5? 

Common words: 
- MISER: M I S E R? Meaning a person who hoards money?
- WISER: W I S E R? Adjective meaning more wise?
- VISER: Not common? Usually ""visor""? 
- RISER: But R at1? Not possible? And R duplicated? But we know no R at1? 
- Other: TISER? Not a word? LISER? No? 

So possible: MISER, WISER? And others? 

But note: we haven't confirmed S at position3? We inferred it? 

But we should aim to guess such a word? 

So for the guess, we can try one of these? 

But we have to choose? We can try ""miser"" or ""wiser""? 

Based on frequency? M is common? Or W? 

But we can also choose a word that we haven't used letters? 

But we are not sure? So we can use either? 

Also, note: from the feedback for ""sired"":
- S at position1 was '-', meaning S is elsewhere? This means S is at another position? We only have positions: 1 (tried), 2 (I), 3 (available), 4 (E), 5 (tried). So S must be at3? 

Similarly, R at position3 was '-'? Because in ""sired"" R was guessed at3? And the secret word has R at5? So that was '-' meaning it is in the word but not at3? 

Therefore, the secret word must be of the form: X I S E R 

Now, we must guess? We can guess ""wiser"" or ""miser""? Or others? 

But to be safe? Or we can use a word that tests X? 

We have two tries left? 

But we can guess a word that checks? 

For example, guess ""wiser"" or ""miser""? 

If we guess ""miser"":
- Feedback: 
  - M: if secret has M at1? Or other? 
  - Etc? 

Since we are almost sure? 

Let's think? 

Another possibility: what if the word has duplicate letters? For example, we assumed no duplicates? But what about S? Or others? 

But for S: in ""sired"", S at1 was '-', meaning S is in the word but elsewhere? So if there was duplicate S? Then S is present? We don't know about duplicates? But the word is limited? 

We have tried: 
Position5 for S: in ""ripes"", S at5 was '-', meaning present? But not at5? 

So if the secret word had two S's? Then we haven't tried S at3? But we are assuming no duplicates? 

Similarly for R: we know R at1,3 were wrong? But if there were two R's? Then R might be at5? And also elsewhere? But we haven't seen evidence? 

To solve: we'll assume no duplicates? 

So we can guess with certainty? 

But we don't know X? So we try one? 

Alternatively, we can guess a word with a common letter? 

We have two options: 

Possibilities: MISER (M) and WISER (W)? 

Also GISER? Not word? 

HISER? No? 

TISER? No? 

KISER? Not really? 

OISER? No? 

UISER? User? U I S E R? Spelled USER? But pattern must be _ I S E R? So U at1? 

USER: U-S-E-R? The pattern would be U at1, I at2? S at3? E at4? R at5? So USER? Wait, U-S-E-R, not U-I-S-E-R? 

But the word must have I at position2? So that's not USER? 

So MISER? WISER? 

Also, H is possible? HISER? Not a word? 

FISER? No? 

Let me confirm: common words ending ""ISER"": 
- MISER 
- WISER 
- VISER? Not really? 
- LISER? Not common? 

So let's choose ""miser""? 

But we haven't tried M? 

If we guess ""miser"":
- Pattern: M I S E R
- If secret is ""miser"": then all ✓? Win?
- If not? Then we know it's ""wiser""?

We have two guesses left? So we can try? 

But we can also think: is there any other possibility? 

What about if S is not at3? But the only other position is position1? But we tried S at1 and it was '-', meaning present? But not at1? So position3 must be S? 

Similarly, R not at1,2,3? So must be at5? 

So the only unknown is position1? 

Therefore, we can list possibilities? 

The word is [letter] I S E R? With [letter] not in {C, A, N, P, D, R? But R at5 is fixed? So any letter except the absent ones? 

Moreover, the letter must form a valid English word? 

Words: 
- MISER: M I S E R? Valid? 
- WISER: W I S E R? Valid? 
- Also: LISER? Not common? 
- TISER? Not a word? 
- GISER? No? 
- Also, BISER? No? 
- Perhaps RISER? But we know R cannot be at1? And secret has R at5? So if RISER, R at1? And R at5? Douplicate? But we know position1 is not R? So RISER is not possible? 

Also, HUSER? Not fitting? 

We have only a few choices? 

Perhaps ""IS"" is not the pattern? 

Another option: maybe the word has duplicates? What if S is not at3? But we have position3 empty? And S must be at3? 

I think MISER and WISER are the most likely? 

To choose one? We can use a common word? 

M: more common as first letter? 

Or W: less frequent? 

But let's look at feedback: 

We must guess? 

We can also guess ""miser"" and if wrong, then ""wiser"" next? 

We have two tries? 

Let's go with ""miser""? 

So guess: ""miser"" 

But let me double-check? 

We can use a word that uses a common unused consonant? 

Alternatively, we can guess a word that tests multiple options? But we are forced to choose? 

I'll choose ""miser"". 

So guess: MISER 

<guess>miser</guess>? 

But what about ""wiser""? 

Perhaps I should consider: are there any other words? 

For example, with O? OISER? Not common? 

U? UISER -> which is not standard? 

Perhaps we missed a word? 

Yes, let me try? 

Other words: 
- TWIER? Not T I S E R? 
- Only MISER and WISER are common. 

So we choose ""miser"". 

But also, ""wiser"" is a word? 

And we have three tries left? Wait, we are at guess 4? 

Total 6 tries? Guess 4: we can guess one? 

So I'll guess ""miser"".
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

1. **crane**:  
   - `C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)`  
     - Absent: C, A, N  
     - Present: R (not position 2), E (not position 5)  

2. **ripes**:  
   - `R(-) I(✓) P(x) E(✓) S(-)`  
     - Position 2: **I** (fixed)  
     - Position 4: **E** (fixed)  
     - Present: R (not position 1), S (not position 5)  
     - Absent: P  

3. **sired**:  
   - `S(-) I(✓) R(-) E(✓) D(x)`  
     - S not at position 1  
     - R not at position 3  
     - Absent: D  

### Deductions:
- **Pattern**: The secret word is `_ I _ E _` (positions 2 and 4 fixed as **I** and **E**).
- **Present letters**:  
  - **R** must be at position 5 (not positions 1, 2, 3 from feedback).  
  - **S** must be at position 3 (not positions 1, 5 from feedback).  
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, P, D.  
- **Unknown**: Position 1 requires a new letter not yet tested (e.g., B, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, Y, Z).  

### Candidate Words:
- The only logical structure: `[position 1] I S E R`.  
- Common English words fitting this pattern:  
  - **miser** (M at position 1)  
  - **wiser** (W at position 1)  
- Given that **miser** is a highly common word, it is the best next guess to test position 1.  

### Guess Justification:
- If **miser** is correct, feedback will show all ✓.  
- If not, feedback for S at position 3 and R at position 5 will confirm their placements, narrowing position 1 to **W** (**wiser**) or other letters.  
- Uses no prohibited letters (C, A, N, P, D) and leverages fixed positions (I, E).  

<guess>miser</guess>",miser,"We are given feedback for three guesses:

1. ""crane"": 
   - C: x (not in the word)
   - R: - (in the word, but wrong position; not position 2)
   - A: x (not in the word)
   - N: x (not in the word)
   - E: - (in the word, but wrong position; not position 5)

2. ""ripes"":
   - R: - (in the word, but not position 1)
   - I: ✓ (correct letter and position; so position 2 is I)
   - P: x (not in the word)
   - E: ✓ (correct letter and position; so position 4 is E)
   - S: - (in the word, but not position 5)

3. ""sired"":
   - S: - (in the word, but wrong position; not position 1)
   - I: ✓ (position 2 correct)
   - R: - (in the word, but wrong position; not position 3)
   - E: ✓ (position 4 correct)
   - D: x (not in the word)

From this, we know:

- The secret word pattern is: _ I _ E _

- Confirmed letters:
  - Position 2: I
  - Position 4: E

- Other letters in the word:
  - R is present but not at positions 1, 2, 3 (from guesses: positions 1,2,3 tried and not correct)
  - S is present but not at positions 1,5 (positions 1 and 5 tried and not correct)

- Absent letters: C, A, N, P, D

Also, since R has been tried at positions 1,2 and 3 and all were wrong position, remaining positions for R are only 5? Because the word must have R somewhere. Similarly, S has been tried at 1 and 5, wrong positions, so S must be at position 3? 

Positions: 1,2,3,4,5
- Position 2 is I (fixed)
- Position 4 is E (fixed)
- Position 1: tried S in ""sired"" -> not S and not correct? Wait: the feedback for S in ""sired"" was at position 1 and marked as ""-"", meaning S is in the word but not at position 1? So S must be at position 3? Because position 2 is I, position 4 is E, and position 5 was tried with S in ""ripes"" and was not correct? So only position 3 left? 

Similarly, R must be at position 5? Because positions 1,2,3 have been tried? Position 2 is I? So not available? And position 4 is E? So R at position 5? 

But wait, we also have one more letter? The word structure: 

- Position 1: ? (not S? But could be other)
- Position 3: ? (must be S? Since S has to go somewhere and only position 3 left? And S is present)
- Position 5: ? (must be R? Because R has to go somewhere? And only position 5 left? Since 1,2,3 tried? But position 2 and 4 are taken? So R at5?)

But then what about position 1? The secret word has 5 letters? So far, we have: I at 2, E at 4, and S must be at 3, R must be at 5? Then position 1 must be a new letter? 

Also, we know: 
- Letters not in the word: C, A, N, P, D (from feedback)
- Used letters: C,R,A,N,E,I,P,S,D (from the three guesses)

So the secret word must be of the form: position1: a new letter (not C,A,N,P,D,R? But R is at5? So position1 cannot be R? Because positions are distinct? Or position1 could be R? But we tried R at1 already? In ""ripes"", R at1 was marked as ""-"", meaning present? But since position1 was wrong? So R is not at1? 

So the secret word is: 
- Position 1: ? (new letter, let's call it X)
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: S? (because S must be at 3? The only untried position? Not at1? Not at5? And not 2 or4? So must be at3? Because there's only position 3 left? 
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: R? (because R not at1,2,3? So must be at5? 

Is that correct? 

But wait, we haven't tried R at position5? But we know R is in the word? So it must be at5? Similarly, S must be at3? 

Then the word is: X I S E R 

Now, we must find X? And X must be a letter not in the absent list? Absent: C,A,N,P,D? And not R? Also, not I or E since at fixed positions? So new letter? 

We haven't used many letters? For example, B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? Some are less common? 

But we need a valid English word? So words ending with ""ISER"": with I at2, S at3, E at4, R at5? 

Common words: 
- MISER: M I S E R? Meaning a person who hoards money?
- WISER: W I S E R? Adjective meaning more wise?
- VISER: Not common? Usually ""visor""? 
- RISER: But R at1? Not possible? And R duplicated? But we know no R at1? 
- Other: TISER? Not a word? LISER? No? 

So possible: MISER, WISER? And others? 

But note: we haven't confirmed S at position3? We inferred it? 

But we should aim to guess such a word? 

So for the guess, we can try one of these? 

But we have to choose? We can try ""miser"" or ""wiser""? 

Based on frequency? M is common? Or W? 

But we can also choose a word that we haven't used letters? 

But we are not sure? So we can use either? 

Also, note: from the feedback for ""sired"":
- S at position1 was '-', meaning S is elsewhere? This means S is at another position? We only have positions: 1 (tried), 2 (I), 3 (available), 4 (E), 5 (tried). So S must be at3? 

Similarly, R at position3 was '-'? Because in ""sired"" R was guessed at3? And the secret word has R at5? So that was '-' meaning it is in the word but not at3? 

Therefore, the secret word must be of the form: X I S E R 

Now, we must guess? We can guess ""wiser"" or ""miser""? Or others? 

But to be safe? Or we can use a word that tests X? 

We have two tries left? 

But we can guess a word that checks? 

For example, guess ""wiser"" or ""miser""? 

If we guess ""miser"":
- Feedback: 
  - M: if secret has M at1? Or other? 
  - Etc? 

Since we are almost sure? 

Let's think? 

Another possibility: what if the word has duplicate letters? For example, we assumed no duplicates? But what about S? Or others? 

But for S: in ""sired"", S at1 was '-', meaning S is in the word but elsewhere? So if there was duplicate S? Then S is present? We don't know about duplicates? But the word is limited? 

We have tried: 
Position5 for S: in ""ripes"", S at5 was '-', meaning present? But not at5? 

So if the secret word had two S's? Then we haven't tried S at3? But we are assuming no duplicates? 

Similarly for R: we know R at1,3 were wrong? But if there were two R's? Then R might be at5? And also elsewhere? But we haven't seen evidence? 

To solve: we'll assume no duplicates? 

So we can guess with certainty? 

But we don't know X? So we try one? 

Alternatively, we can guess a word with a common letter? 

We have two options: 

Possibilities: MISER (M) and WISER (W)? 

Also GISER? Not word? 

HISER? No? 

TISER? No? 

KISER? Not really? 

OISER? No? 

UISER? User? U I S E R? Spelled USER? But pattern must be _ I S E R? So U at1? 

USER: U-S-E-R? The pattern would be U at1, I at2? S at3? E at4? R at5? So USER? Wait, U-S-E-R, not U-I-S-E-R? 

But the word must have I at position2? So that's not USER? 

So MISER? WISER? 

Also, H is possible? HISER? Not a word? 

FISER? No? 

Let me confirm: common words ending ""ISER"": 
- MISER 
- WISER 
- VISER? Not really? 
- LISER? Not common? 

So let's choose ""miser""? 

But we haven't tried M? 

If we guess ""miser"":
- Pattern: M I S E R
- If secret is ""miser"": then all ✓? Win?
- If not? Then we know it's ""wiser""?

We have two guesses left? So we can try? 

But we can also think: is there any other possibility? 

What about if S is not at3? But the only other position is position1? But we tried S at1 and it was '-', meaning present? But not at1? So position3 must be S? 

Similarly, R not at1,2,3? So must be at5? 

So the only unknown is position1? 

Therefore, we can list possibilities? 

The word is [letter] I S E R? With [letter] not in {C, A, N, P, D, R? But R at5 is fixed? So any letter except the absent ones? 

Moreover, the letter must form a valid English word? 

Words: 
- MISER: M I S E R? Valid? 
- WISER: W I S E R? Valid? 
- Also: LISER? Not common? 
- TISER? Not a word? 
- GISER? No? 
- Also, BISER? No? 
- Perhaps RISER? But we know R cannot be at1? And secret has R at5? So if RISER, R at1? And R at5? Douplicate? But we know position1 is not R? So RISER is not possible? 

Also, HUSER? Not fitting? 

We have only a few choices? 

Perhaps ""IS"" is not the pattern? 

Another option: maybe the word has duplicates? What if S is not at3? But we have position3 empty? And S must be at3? 

I think MISER and WISER are the most likely? 

To choose one? We can use a common word? 

M: more common as first letter? 

Or W: less frequent? 

But let's look at feedback: 

We must guess? 

We can also guess ""miser"" and if wrong, then ""wiser"" next? 

We have two tries? 

Let's go with ""miser""? 

So guess: ""miser"" 

But let me double-check? 

We can use a word that uses a common unused consonant? 

Alternatively, we can guess a word that tests multiple options? But we are forced to choose? 

I'll choose ""miser"". 

So guess: MISER 

<guess>miser</guess>? 

But what about ""wiser""? 

Perhaps I should consider: are there any other words? 

For example, with O? OISER? Not common? 

U? UISER -> which is not standard? 

Perhaps we missed a word? 

Yes, let me try? 

Other words: 
- TWIER? Not T I S E R? 
- Only MISER and WISER are common. 

So we choose ""miser"". 

But also, ""wiser"" is a word? 

And we have three tries left? Wait, we are at guess 4? 

Total 6 tries? Guess 4: we can guess one? 

So I'll guess ""miser"".After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

1. **crane**:  
   - `C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)`  
     - Absent: C, A, N  
     - Present: R (not position 2), E (not position 5)  

2. **ripes**:  
   - `R(-) I(✓) P(x) E(✓) S(-)`  
     - Position 2: **I** (fixed)  
     - Position 4: **E** (fixed)  
     - Present: R (not position 1), S (not position 5)  
     - Absent: P  

3. **sired**:  
   - `S(-) I(✓) R(-) E(✓) D(x)`  
     - S not at position 1  
     - R not at position 3  
     - Absent: D  

### Deductions:
- **Pattern**: The secret word is `_ I _ E _` (positions 2 and 4 fixed as **I** and **E**).
- **Present letters**:  
  - **R** must be at position 5 (not positions 1, 2, 3 from feedback).  
  - **S** must be at position 3 (not positions 1, 5 from feedback).  
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, P, D.  
- **Unknown**: Position 1 requires a new letter not yet tested (e.g., B, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, Y, Z).  

### Candidate Words:
- The only logical structure: `[position 1] I S E R`.  
- Common English words fitting this pattern:  
  - **miser** (M at position 1)  
  - **wiser** (W at position 1)  
- Given that **miser** is a highly common word, it is the best next guess to test position 1.  

### Guess Justification:
- If **miser** is correct, feedback will show all ✓.  
- If not, feedback for S at position 3 and R at position 5 will confirm their placements, narrowing position 1 to **W** (**wiser**) or other letters.  
- Uses no prohibited letters (C, A, N, P, D) and leverages fixed positions (I, E).",Guess 4: miser -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) I(✓) S(✓) E(✓) R(✓),SUCCESS
