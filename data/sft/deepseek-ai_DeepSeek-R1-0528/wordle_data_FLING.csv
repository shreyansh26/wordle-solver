We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess:
 Guess: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)

 This means:
  C is not in the secret word -> x
  R is not in the secret word -> x
  A is not in the secret word -> x
  N is in the word and in the correct position -> ✓ (fourth letter)
  E is not in the secret word -> x

 So, we know:
  1. The fourth letter of the secret word is N.
  2. The letters C, R, A, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, we must avoid using C, R, A, E in our next guess.

 Also, since N is in the fourth position, our next guess must have N in the fourth position.

 Now, we need to choose a word that:
  - Has N as the fourth letter.
  - Contains only letters that are not C, R, A, E (and possibly other excluded letters, but so far only these).
  - Uses other common letters to maximize information.

 Since we have eliminated some vowels (A, E), we have left: vowels -> I, O, U (and sometimes Y).
 Consonants: many left, such as B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We also know that the word does not contain R, so we avoid that.

 Let's think of words that have N in the fourth position.

 Common pattern: _ _ _ N _

 We have to fill in the first, second, third, and fifth positions.

 We should avoid letters that are known to be absent: C, R, A, E.

 Possible words? Let's brainstorm:

  - Using common letters: S, T, L, O, P, etc.

 Examples:
  ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> This has no C,R,A,E and N at the fourth position? 
    Breakdown: 
      Position: 1: P, 2: O, 3: I, 4: N, 5: T
    But wait, our feedback only said N is in the fourth position, but the word ""point"" has N at the fourth? Actually, yes: 
      P (1st), O (2nd), I (3rd), N (4th), T (5th). So that fits.

  Other possibilities:
    ""JOINT"": J, O, I, N, T -> also okay, but J is less common.
    ""MOUNT"": M, O, U, N, T -> avoids the bad letters? M,O,U,N,T: no C,R,A,E -> okay.
    ""COUNT"": But C is excluded -> not allowed, because C is absent in the secret word.

 We must avoid C, so ""count"" is out.

 Other words: ""BLUNT"", ""FLINT"", ""GRANT"" (but G,R,A: R and A are excluded) -> so ""GRANT"" is invalid because of R and A.

 After eliminating, let's consider:

  ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> good.
  ""MOUNT"": M, O, U, N, T -> good.
  ""TOWNS"": T, O, W, N, S -> avoids bad letters? T,O,W,N,S: no C,R,A,E -> good.

 But note: the feedback for ""crane"" showed that N is in the correct position (fourth). So we must have N in the fourth.

 Now, we want to test for other common letters. Since we have eliminated A and E, we can test O and U (vowels) and common consonants like T, S, L, P, etc.

 Considering ""POINT"": 
   It lets us check P, O, I, T (in addition to the known N).

 ""MOUNT"": checks M, O, U, T.

 We might also consider ""MINTS"", but note the feedback only said N is in the fourth letter, and we don't know about duplicates. But the word ""minst"" isn't common? Actually, ""MINTS"": M-I-N-T-S. This has S at the end and T. But note: we are guessing and the word must be valid.

 However, we have to be cautious: we don't know if the word has repeated letters? But since we haven't encountered duplicates yet, we assume a word without duplication for now? Actually, the rules don't prohibit duplicates, but in this case we are guessing a new word without using the letters we know are absent.

 But note: we are limited by the fact that C, R, A, E cannot be in the word. Also, we must have N in the fourth position.

 Let's choose a word that uses letters we haven't tested so that we get more coverage.

 Previously in ""crane"", we tested C,R,A,N,E. Now we avoid those. So we want to use:

   Possible letters: 
     Vowels: I, O, U (and Y)
     Consonants: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,S,T,V,W,X,Y,Z

 However, we don't know about all letters. We tested: C,R,A,E -> absent.

 Now, if we choose ""POINT"", we are testing P, O, I, T (and N we know is in the fourth).

 If we choose ""MOUNT"", we test M, O, U, T.

 Another option: ""SHUNT"" (S,H,U,N,T) -> H and U are new.

 We need to get as many new letters as possible.

 Let's look for words that have many common letters we haven't tried.

 Considering common consonants: S, T, L are very common. We haven't tried S, T, L? 

 In ""crane"", we did T? No: C,R,A,N,E didn't include T.

 So we can try to include S and T and L.

 Example: ""POINT"" has T at the end? Yes.

 Or ""SPOIL"": but fourth letter must be N -> not N? No, wait: S-P-O-I-L -> fourth is I? So not N? Therefore, we must have fourth letter N.

 Another word: ""LUNTS"" -> L-U-N-T-S -> fourth letter is N? Let's see: 
   L (1), U (2), N (3), T (4), S (5) -> that would have N at the third, not fourth? 
   We need: _ _ _ N _ -> so the fourth is N, meaning positions: 
     1st: ?, 2nd: ?, 3rd: ?, 4th: N, 5th: ?

 So we need the fourth letter to be the fourth character: the third character can be any letter.

 Therefore, ""LUNTS"" would be: L-U-N-T? Then it would be L (1), U (2), N (3) -> but we need N at the fourth? So that doesn't fit.

 Actually, the word ""lunts"" is L-U-N-T: but that's five letters? 
   - Actually, it would be: position 1: L, 2: U, 3: N, 4: T, 5: S? 
   Then N is at the third? So not fourth.

 How about ""JOINS""? J-O-I-N-S: 
   Position: J (1), O (2), I (3), N (4), S (5) -> perfect.

 But J is less common, so maybe not the best.

 How about ""COINS""? But C is excluded -> invalid.

 How about ""POINT"": P-O-I-N-T -> P(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> this works.

 How about ""JOINT""? Same as above but J. 

 Another word: ""TAWNY"": T-A-W-N-Y -> but A is excluded -> invalid.

 ""DOWNY"": D-O-W-N-Y -> D(1), O(2), W(3), N(4), Y(5). This avoids excluded letters? 
   D: not excluded? 
   O: okay.
   W: okay.
   N: okay (but already known at fourth).
   Y: okay.

 But wait, we have to avoid A and E? Yes. So ""DOWNY"" is acceptable? 
   However, we know A is excluded, so ""DOWNY"" doesn't have A or the others.

 So ""DOWNY"" is a candidate.

 However, we don't want to use too many rare letters? And we are trying to get information.

 Let me compare:

  Candidate words:

   ""POINT"": letters -> P, O, I, T (and N)
   ""JOINT"": J is rare -> avoid?
   ""DOWNY"": D, O, W, Y -> D and W and Y are not as common? But why not? They are valid.

   Another one: ""TOWN'S"" isn't valid? ""TOWNS"": T-O-W-N-S -> T(1), O(2), W(3), N(4), S(5) -> good.

   ""MINUS"": M-I-N-U-S -> M(1), I(2), N(3), U(4), S(5) -> N is at the third? Not fourth -> invalid.

 So we must have the fourth letter N.

 Another candidate: ""BORNS""? But B-O-R-N-S: R is excluded? We have R in ""crane"" and feedback said R is not in the word -> so cannot use R.

 Therefore, ""BORNS"" is invalid.

 How about ""SONGS""? S-O-N-G-S: the fourth letter is the fourth character: 
   S(1), O(2), N(3) -> wait, then G(4), S(5)? So N is at third? And G at fourth? Not correct.

 We must have the fourth letter being N: the word must be in the form ???N?.

 So ""SONGS"" doesn't have the fourth letter as N? Actually, 
   S -> first
   O -> second
   N -> third? 
   G -> fourth
   S -> fifth

 So we need the N in the fourth? So if we had ""SOGND"" that doesn't make sense.

 Another candidate: ""BUNKS"": B-U-N-K-S -> B(1), U(2), N(3) -> N is third? Then K(4), S(5) -> no.

 ""PUNKS"": same problem: P(1), U(2), N(3), K(4), S(5) -> N at third.

 How about ""PLANK"": P-L-A-N-K -> but A is excluded -> invalid.

 ""BLINK"": B-L-I-N-K -> B(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), K(5) -> good. However, we haven't eliminated B,L,I,K? No, because only C,R,A,E are gone. So valid.

 But note: we don't know if the word has I or not? So ""BLINK"" is a candidate.

 Now, comparing:

   POINT: uses P,O,I,T
   BLINK: uses B,L,I,N,K -> but we already know N? But we are testing B,L,I,K.
   TOWNS: uses T,O,W,N,S

 We want to maximize coverage of new letters.

 Previously used: C, R, A, N, E (but N is known, and the others absent except N).
 So we have used 5 letters: C,R,A,N,E.

 For the next guess, we can include N because we know it's in the word and we are using it in the correct position? But we are also testing other letters.

 Idea: choose a word that uses as many new letters as possible.

 Considering:

   POINT: P, O, I, T -> all new? and N (we know is present, so only feedback on new letters).

   BLINK: B, L, I, K -> and N -> all new? 

   TOWNS: T, O, W, N, S -> T, O, W, S new.

 But note: in BLINK, the letter I is at the third position? We are testing I? That's fine.

 However, we are only on the second guess, so we don't have many constraints.

 I think ""POINT"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters.

 Another candidate: ""SPOIL"" -> but we need fourth letter N? Not possible.

 Let's go with ""POINT"". It has the form: 
   Position 1: P, Position 2: O, Position 3: I, Position 4: N, Position 5: T.

 This fits the pattern.

 So we guess ""POINT"".

<guess>point</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- **C, R, A, E** are **NOT** in the secret word (marked ""x"").  
- **N** is **CORRECTLY** placed in the 4th position (marked ""✓"").  

### Strategy for Second Guess:
- The secret word has **N in the 4th position** and excludes **C, R, A, E**.  
- Choose a word that:  
  - Has **N as the 4th letter**.  
  - Uses common unused letters (e.g., **S, T, L, O, P**, since vowels **I, O, U** are untested).  
  - Avoids **C, R, A, E**.  
- Good candidates: POINT, TOWN, JOINT, BLINK, MOUNT.  
- Selected **""POINT""** because it:  
  - Maximizes new common letters (**P, O, I, T**).  
  - Fits the constraint (N in position 4: P-O-**I-N-T**).  
  - Is a common English word.  

Now guessing ""POINT"" to test new positions and letters.  

<guess>point</guess>",point,"We are given feedback from the first guess:
 Guess: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)

 This means:
  C is not in the secret word -> x
  R is not in the secret word -> x
  A is not in the secret word -> x
  N is in the word and in the correct position -> ✓ (fourth letter)
  E is not in the secret word -> x

 So, we know:
  1. The fourth letter of the secret word is N.
  2. The letters C, R, A, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, we must avoid using C, R, A, E in our next guess.

 Also, since N is in the fourth position, our next guess must have N in the fourth position.

 Now, we need to choose a word that:
  - Has N as the fourth letter.
  - Contains only letters that are not C, R, A, E (and possibly other excluded letters, but so far only these).
  - Uses other common letters to maximize information.

 Since we have eliminated some vowels (A, E), we have left: vowels -> I, O, U (and sometimes Y).
 Consonants: many left, such as B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We also know that the word does not contain R, so we avoid that.

 Let's think of words that have N in the fourth position.

 Common pattern: _ _ _ N _

 We have to fill in the first, second, third, and fifth positions.

 We should avoid letters that are known to be absent: C, R, A, E.

 Possible words? Let's brainstorm:

  - Using common letters: S, T, L, O, P, etc.

 Examples:
  ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> This has no C,R,A,E and N at the fourth position? 
    Breakdown: 
      Position: 1: P, 2: O, 3: I, 4: N, 5: T
    But wait, our feedback only said N is in the fourth position, but the word ""point"" has N at the fourth? Actually, yes: 
      P (1st), O (2nd), I (3rd), N (4th), T (5th). So that fits.

  Other possibilities:
    ""JOINT"": J, O, I, N, T -> also okay, but J is less common.
    ""MOUNT"": M, O, U, N, T -> avoids the bad letters? M,O,U,N,T: no C,R,A,E -> okay.
    ""COUNT"": But C is excluded -> not allowed, because C is absent in the secret word.

 We must avoid C, so ""count"" is out.

 Other words: ""BLUNT"", ""FLINT"", ""GRANT"" (but G,R,A: R and A are excluded) -> so ""GRANT"" is invalid because of R and A.

 After eliminating, let's consider:

  ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> good.
  ""MOUNT"": M, O, U, N, T -> good.
  ""TOWNS"": T, O, W, N, S -> avoids bad letters? T,O,W,N,S: no C,R,A,E -> good.

 But note: the feedback for ""crane"" showed that N is in the correct position (fourth). So we must have N in the fourth.

 Now, we want to test for other common letters. Since we have eliminated A and E, we can test O and U (vowels) and common consonants like T, S, L, P, etc.

 Considering ""POINT"": 
   It lets us check P, O, I, T (in addition to the known N).

 ""MOUNT"": checks M, O, U, T.

 We might also consider ""MINTS"", but note the feedback only said N is in the fourth letter, and we don't know about duplicates. But the word ""minst"" isn't common? Actually, ""MINTS"": M-I-N-T-S. This has S at the end and T. But note: we are guessing and the word must be valid.

 However, we have to be cautious: we don't know if the word has repeated letters? But since we haven't encountered duplicates yet, we assume a word without duplication for now? Actually, the rules don't prohibit duplicates, but in this case we are guessing a new word without using the letters we know are absent.

 But note: we are limited by the fact that C, R, A, E cannot be in the word. Also, we must have N in the fourth position.

 Let's choose a word that uses letters we haven't tested so that we get more coverage.

 Previously in ""crane"", we tested C,R,A,N,E. Now we avoid those. So we want to use:

   Possible letters: 
     Vowels: I, O, U (and Y)
     Consonants: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,S,T,V,W,X,Y,Z

 However, we don't know about all letters. We tested: C,R,A,E -> absent.

 Now, if we choose ""POINT"", we are testing P, O, I, T (and N we know is in the fourth).

 If we choose ""MOUNT"", we test M, O, U, T.

 Another option: ""SHUNT"" (S,H,U,N,T) -> H and U are new.

 We need to get as many new letters as possible.

 Let's look for words that have many common letters we haven't tried.

 Considering common consonants: S, T, L are very common. We haven't tried S, T, L? 

 In ""crane"", we did T? No: C,R,A,N,E didn't include T.

 So we can try to include S and T and L.

 Example: ""POINT"" has T at the end? Yes.

 Or ""SPOIL"": but fourth letter must be N -> not N? No, wait: S-P-O-I-L -> fourth is I? So not N? Therefore, we must have fourth letter N.

 Another word: ""LUNTS"" -> L-U-N-T-S -> fourth letter is N? Let's see: 
   L (1), U (2), N (3), T (4), S (5) -> that would have N at the third, not fourth? 
   We need: _ _ _ N _ -> so the fourth is N, meaning positions: 
     1st: ?, 2nd: ?, 3rd: ?, 4th: N, 5th: ?

 So we need the fourth letter to be the fourth character: the third character can be any letter.

 Therefore, ""LUNTS"" would be: L-U-N-T? Then it would be L (1), U (2), N (3) -> but we need N at the fourth? So that doesn't fit.

 Actually, the word ""lunts"" is L-U-N-T: but that's five letters? 
   - Actually, it would be: position 1: L, 2: U, 3: N, 4: T, 5: S? 
   Then N is at the third? So not fourth.

 How about ""JOINS""? J-O-I-N-S: 
   Position: J (1), O (2), I (3), N (4), S (5) -> perfect.

 But J is less common, so maybe not the best.

 How about ""COINS""? But C is excluded -> invalid.

 How about ""POINT"": P-O-I-N-T -> P(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> this works.

 How about ""JOINT""? Same as above but J. 

 Another word: ""TAWNY"": T-A-W-N-Y -> but A is excluded -> invalid.

 ""DOWNY"": D-O-W-N-Y -> D(1), O(2), W(3), N(4), Y(5). This avoids excluded letters? 
   D: not excluded? 
   O: okay.
   W: okay.
   N: okay (but already known at fourth).
   Y: okay.

 But wait, we have to avoid A and E? Yes. So ""DOWNY"" is acceptable? 
   However, we know A is excluded, so ""DOWNY"" doesn't have A or the others.

 So ""DOWNY"" is a candidate.

 However, we don't want to use too many rare letters? And we are trying to get information.

 Let me compare:

  Candidate words:

   ""POINT"": letters -> P, O, I, T (and N)
   ""JOINT"": J is rare -> avoid?
   ""DOWNY"": D, O, W, Y -> D and W and Y are not as common? But why not? They are valid.

   Another one: ""TOWN'S"" isn't valid? ""TOWNS"": T-O-W-N-S -> T(1), O(2), W(3), N(4), S(5) -> good.

   ""MINUS"": M-I-N-U-S -> M(1), I(2), N(3), U(4), S(5) -> N is at the third? Not fourth -> invalid.

 So we must have the fourth letter N.

 Another candidate: ""BORNS""? But B-O-R-N-S: R is excluded? We have R in ""crane"" and feedback said R is not in the word -> so cannot use R.

 Therefore, ""BORNS"" is invalid.

 How about ""SONGS""? S-O-N-G-S: the fourth letter is the fourth character: 
   S(1), O(2), N(3) -> wait, then G(4), S(5)? So N is at third? And G at fourth? Not correct.

 We must have the fourth letter being N: the word must be in the form ???N?.

 So ""SONGS"" doesn't have the fourth letter as N? Actually, 
   S -> first
   O -> second
   N -> third? 
   G -> fourth
   S -> fifth

 So we need the N in the fourth? So if we had ""SOGND"" that doesn't make sense.

 Another candidate: ""BUNKS"": B-U-N-K-S -> B(1), U(2), N(3) -> N is third? Then K(4), S(5) -> no.

 ""PUNKS"": same problem: P(1), U(2), N(3), K(4), S(5) -> N at third.

 How about ""PLANK"": P-L-A-N-K -> but A is excluded -> invalid.

 ""BLINK"": B-L-I-N-K -> B(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), K(5) -> good. However, we haven't eliminated B,L,I,K? No, because only C,R,A,E are gone. So valid.

 But note: we don't know if the word has I or not? So ""BLINK"" is a candidate.

 Now, comparing:

   POINT: uses P,O,I,T
   BLINK: uses B,L,I,N,K -> but we already know N? But we are testing B,L,I,K.
   TOWNS: uses T,O,W,N,S

 We want to maximize coverage of new letters.

 Previously used: C, R, A, N, E (but N is known, and the others absent except N).
 So we have used 5 letters: C,R,A,N,E.

 For the next guess, we can include N because we know it's in the word and we are using it in the correct position? But we are also testing other letters.

 Idea: choose a word that uses as many new letters as possible.

 Considering:

   POINT: P, O, I, T -> all new? and N (we know is present, so only feedback on new letters).

   BLINK: B, L, I, K -> and N -> all new? 

   TOWNS: T, O, W, N, S -> T, O, W, S new.

 But note: in BLINK, the letter I is at the third position? We are testing I? That's fine.

 However, we are only on the second guess, so we don't have many constraints.

 I think ""POINT"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters.

 Another candidate: ""SPOIL"" -> but we need fourth letter N? Not possible.

 Let's go with ""POINT"". It has the form: 
   Position 1: P, Position 2: O, Position 3: I, Position 4: N, Position 5: T.

 This fits the pattern.

 So we guess ""POINT"".

<guess>point</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- **C, R, A, E** are **NOT** in the secret word (marked ""x"").  
- **N** is **CORRECTLY** placed in the 4th position (marked ""✓"").  

### Strategy for Second Guess:
- The secret word has **N in the 4th position** and excludes **C, R, A, E**.  
- Choose a word that:  
  - Has **N as the 4th letter**.  
  - Uses common unused letters (e.g., **S, T, L, O, P**, since vowels **I, O, U** are untested).  
  - Avoids **C, R, A, E**.  
- Good candidates: POINT, TOWN, JOINT, BLINK, MOUNT.  
- Selected **""POINT""** because it:  
  - Maximizes new common letters (**P, O, I, T**).  
  - Fits the constraint (N in position 4: P-O-**I-N-T**).  
  - Is a common English word.

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,FLING,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess:
 Guess: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)

 This means:
  C is not in the secret word -> x
  R is not in the secret word -> x
  A is not in the secret word -> x
  N is in the word and in the correct position -> ✓ (fourth letter)
  E is not in the secret word -> x

 So, we know:
  1. The fourth letter of the secret word is N.
  2. The letters C, R, A, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, we must avoid using C, R, A, E in our next guess.

 Also, since N is in the fourth position, our next guess must have N in the fourth position.

 Now, we need to choose a word that:
  - Has N as the fourth letter.
  - Contains only letters that are not C, R, A, E (and possibly other excluded letters, but so far only these).
  - Uses other common letters to maximize information.

 Since we have eliminated some vowels (A, E), we have left: vowels -> I, O, U (and sometimes Y).
 Consonants: many left, such as B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We also know that the word does not contain R, so we avoid that.

 Let's think of words that have N in the fourth position.

 Common pattern: _ _ _ N _

 We have to fill in the first, second, third, and fifth positions.

 We should avoid letters that are known to be absent: C, R, A, E.

 Possible words? Let's brainstorm:

  - Using common letters: S, T, L, O, P, etc.

 Examples:
  ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> This has no C,R,A,E and N at the fourth position? 
    Breakdown: 
      Position: 1: P, 2: O, 3: I, 4: N, 5: T
    But wait, our feedback only said N is in the fourth position, but the word ""point"" has N at the fourth? Actually, yes: 
      P (1st), O (2nd), I (3rd), N (4th), T (5th). So that fits.

  Other possibilities:
    ""JOINT"": J, O, I, N, T -> also okay, but J is less common.
    ""MOUNT"": M, O, U, N, T -> avoids the bad letters? M,O,U,N,T: no C,R,A,E -> okay.
    ""COUNT"": But C is excluded -> not allowed, because C is absent in the secret word.

 We must avoid C, so ""count"" is out.

 Other words: ""BLUNT"", ""FLINT"", ""GRANT"" (but G,R,A: R and A are excluded) -> so ""GRANT"" is invalid because of R and A.

 After eliminating, let's consider:

  ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> good.
  ""MOUNT"": M, O, U, N, T -> good.
  ""TOWNS"": T, O, W, N, S -> avoids bad letters? T,O,W,N,S: no C,R,A,E -> good.

 But note: the feedback for ""crane"" showed that N is in the correct position (fourth). So we must have N in the fourth.

 Now, we want to test for other common letters. Since we have eliminated A and E, we can test O and U (vowels) and common consonants like T, S, L, P, etc.

 Considering ""POINT"": 
   It lets us check P, O, I, T (in addition to the known N).

 ""MOUNT"": checks M, O, U, T.

 We might also consider ""MINTS"", but note the feedback only said N is in the fourth letter, and we don't know about duplicates. But the word ""minst"" isn't common? Actually, ""MINTS"": M-I-N-T-S. This has S at the end and T. But note: we are guessing and the word must be valid.

 However, we have to be cautious: we don't know if the word has repeated letters? But since we haven't encountered duplicates yet, we assume a word without duplication for now? Actually, the rules don't prohibit duplicates, but in this case we are guessing a new word without using the letters we know are absent.

 But note: we are limited by the fact that C, R, A, E cannot be in the word. Also, we must have N in the fourth position.

 Let's choose a word that uses letters we haven't tested so that we get more coverage.

 Previously in ""crane"", we tested C,R,A,N,E. Now we avoid those. So we want to use:

   Possible letters: 
     Vowels: I, O, U (and Y)
     Consonants: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,S,T,V,W,X,Y,Z

 However, we don't know about all letters. We tested: C,R,A,E -> absent.

 Now, if we choose ""POINT"", we are testing P, O, I, T (and N we know is in the fourth).

 If we choose ""MOUNT"", we test M, O, U, T.

 Another option: ""SHUNT"" (S,H,U,N,T) -> H and U are new.

 We need to get as many new letters as possible.

 Let's look for words that have many common letters we haven't tried.

 Considering common consonants: S, T, L are very common. We haven't tried S, T, L? 

 In ""crane"", we did T? No: C,R,A,N,E didn't include T.

 So we can try to include S and T and L.

 Example: ""POINT"" has T at the end? Yes.

 Or ""SPOIL"": but fourth letter must be N -> not N? No, wait: S-P-O-I-L -> fourth is I? So not N? Therefore, we must have fourth letter N.

 Another word: ""LUNTS"" -> L-U-N-T-S -> fourth letter is N? Let's see: 
   L (1), U (2), N (3), T (4), S (5) -> that would have N at the third, not fourth? 
   We need: _ _ _ N _ -> so the fourth is N, meaning positions: 
     1st: ?, 2nd: ?, 3rd: ?, 4th: N, 5th: ?

 So we need the fourth letter to be the fourth character: the third character can be any letter.

 Therefore, ""LUNTS"" would be: L-U-N-T? Then it would be L (1), U (2), N (3) -> but we need N at the fourth? So that doesn't fit.

 Actually, the word ""lunts"" is L-U-N-T: but that's five letters? 
   - Actually, it would be: position 1: L, 2: U, 3: N, 4: T, 5: S? 
   Then N is at the third? So not fourth.

 How about ""JOINS""? J-O-I-N-S: 
   Position: J (1), O (2), I (3), N (4), S (5) -> perfect.

 But J is less common, so maybe not the best.

 How about ""COINS""? But C is excluded -> invalid.

 How about ""POINT"": P-O-I-N-T -> P(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> this works.

 How about ""JOINT""? Same as above but J. 

 Another word: ""TAWNY"": T-A-W-N-Y -> but A is excluded -> invalid.

 ""DOWNY"": D-O-W-N-Y -> D(1), O(2), W(3), N(4), Y(5). This avoids excluded letters? 
   D: not excluded? 
   O: okay.
   W: okay.
   N: okay (but already known at fourth).
   Y: okay.

 But wait, we have to avoid A and E? Yes. So ""DOWNY"" is acceptable? 
   However, we know A is excluded, so ""DOWNY"" doesn't have A or the others.

 So ""DOWNY"" is a candidate.

 However, we don't want to use too many rare letters? And we are trying to get information.

 Let me compare:

  Candidate words:

   ""POINT"": letters -> P, O, I, T (and N)
   ""JOINT"": J is rare -> avoid?
   ""DOWNY"": D, O, W, Y -> D and W and Y are not as common? But why not? They are valid.

   Another one: ""TOWN'S"" isn't valid? ""TOWNS"": T-O-W-N-S -> T(1), O(2), W(3), N(4), S(5) -> good.

   ""MINUS"": M-I-N-U-S -> M(1), I(2), N(3), U(4), S(5) -> N is at the third? Not fourth -> invalid.

 So we must have the fourth letter N.

 Another candidate: ""BORNS""? But B-O-R-N-S: R is excluded? We have R in ""crane"" and feedback said R is not in the word -> so cannot use R.

 Therefore, ""BORNS"" is invalid.

 How about ""SONGS""? S-O-N-G-S: the fourth letter is the fourth character: 
   S(1), O(2), N(3) -> wait, then G(4), S(5)? So N is at third? And G at fourth? Not correct.

 We must have the fourth letter being N: the word must be in the form ???N?.

 So ""SONGS"" doesn't have the fourth letter as N? Actually, 
   S -> first
   O -> second
   N -> third? 
   G -> fourth
   S -> fifth

 So we need the N in the fourth? So if we had ""SOGND"" that doesn't make sense.

 Another candidate: ""BUNKS"": B-U-N-K-S -> B(1), U(2), N(3) -> N is third? Then K(4), S(5) -> no.

 ""PUNKS"": same problem: P(1), U(2), N(3), K(4), S(5) -> N at third.

 How about ""PLANK"": P-L-A-N-K -> but A is excluded -> invalid.

 ""BLINK"": B-L-I-N-K -> B(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), K(5) -> good. However, we haven't eliminated B,L,I,K? No, because only C,R,A,E are gone. So valid.

 But note: we don't know if the word has I or not? So ""BLINK"" is a candidate.

 Now, comparing:

   POINT: uses P,O,I,T
   BLINK: uses B,L,I,N,K -> but we already know N? But we are testing B,L,I,K.
   TOWNS: uses T,O,W,N,S

 We want to maximize coverage of new letters.

 Previously used: C, R, A, N, E (but N is known, and the others absent except N).
 So we have used 5 letters: C,R,A,N,E.

 For the next guess, we can include N because we know it's in the word and we are using it in the correct position? But we are also testing other letters.

 Idea: choose a word that uses as many new letters as possible.

 Considering:

   POINT: P, O, I, T -> all new? and N (we know is present, so only feedback on new letters).

   BLINK: B, L, I, K -> and N -> all new? 

   TOWNS: T, O, W, N, S -> T, O, W, S new.

 But note: in BLINK, the letter I is at the third position? We are testing I? That's fine.

 However, we are only on the second guess, so we don't have many constraints.

 I think ""POINT"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters.

 Another candidate: ""SPOIL"" -> but we need fourth letter N? Not possible.

 Let's go with ""POINT"". It has the form: 
   Position 1: P, Position 2: O, Position 3: I, Position 4: N, Position 5: T.

 This fits the pattern.

 So we guess ""POINT"".

We have R in ""crane"" and feedback said R is not in the word -> so cannot use R.\n\n Therefore, ""BORNS"" is invalid.\n\n How about ""SONGS""? S-O-N-G-S: the fourth letter is the fourth character: \n   S(1), O(2), N(3) -> wait, then G(4), S(5)? So N is at third? And G at fourth? Not correct.\n\n We must have the fourth letter being N: the word must be in the form ???N?.\n\n So ""SONGS"" doesn\'t have the fourth letter as N? Actually, \n   S -> first\n   O -> second\n   N -> third? \n   G -> fourth\n   S -> fifth\n\n So we need the N in the fourth? So if we had ""SOGND"" that doesn\'t make sense.\n\n Another candidate: ""BUNKS"": B-U-N-K-S -> B(1), U(2), N(3) -> N is third? Then K(4), S(5) -> no.\n\n ""PUNKS"": same problem: P(1), U(2), N(3), K(4), S(5) -> N at third.\n\n How about ""PLANK"": P-L-A-N-K -> but A is excluded -> invalid.\n\n ""BLINK"": B-L-I-N-K -> B(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), K(5) -> good. However, we haven\'t eliminated B,L,I,K? No, because only C,R,A,E are gone. So valid.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if the word has I or not? So ""BLINK"" is a candidate.\n\n Now, comparing:\n\n   POINT: uses P,O,I,T\n   BLINK: uses B,L,I,N,K -> but we already know N? But we are testing B,L,I,K.\n   TOWNS: uses T,O,W,N,S\n\n We want to maximize coverage of new letters.\n\n Previously used: C, R, A, N, E (but N is known, and the others absent except N).\n So we have used 5 letters: C,R,A,N,E.\n\n For the next guess, we can include N because we know it\'s in the word and we are using it in the correct position? But we are also testing other letters.\n\n Idea: choose a word that uses as many new letters as possible.\n\n Considering:\n\n   POINT: P, O, I, T -> all new? and N (we know is present, so only feedback on new letters).\n\n   BLINK: B, L, I, K -> and N -> all new? \n\n   TOWNS: T, O, W, N, S -> T, O, W, S new.\n\n But note: in BLINK, the letter I is at the third position? We are testing I? That\'s fine.\n\n However, we are only on the second guess, so we don\'t have many constraints.\n\n I think ""POINT"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters.\n\n Another candidate: ""SPOIL"" -> but we need fourth letter N? Not possible.\n\n Let\'s go with ""POINT"". It has the form: \n   Position 1: P, Position 2: O, Position 3: I, Position 4: N, Position 5: T.\n\n This fits the pattern.\n\n So we guess ""POINT"".\n\n<guess>point</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  \n- **C, R, A, E** are **NOT** in the secret word (marked ""x"").  \n- **N** is **CORRECTLY** placed in the 4th position (marked ""✓"").  \n\n### Strategy for Second Guess:\n- The secret word has **N in the 4th position** and excludes **C, R, A, E**.  \n- Choose a word that:  \n  - Has **N as the 4th letter**.  \n  - Uses common unused letters (e.g., **S, T, L, O, P**, since vowels **I, O, U** are untested).  \n  - Avoids **C, R, A, E**.  \n- Good candidates: POINT, TOWN, JOINT, BLINK, MOUNT.  \n- Selected **""POINT""** because it:  \n  - Maximizes new common letters (**P, O, I, T**).  \n  - Fits the constraint (N in position 4: P-O-**I-N-T**).  \n  - Is a common English word.  \n\nNow guessing ""POINT"" to test new positions and letters.\n\n<guess>point</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(✓) N(✓) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
Second guess: ""point"" -> Feedback: P(x) O(x) I(✓) N(✓) T(x)

From this, we know:

1. The secret word has the **fourth letter (position 4) as N**. 
2. The secret word has the **third letter (position 3) as I** (since in ""point"", I is at position 3, and it got a ✓).
3. Letters **C, R, A, E, P, O, T** are **not** in the word (based on both feedbacks).
   - Specifically, absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, O, T.

Therefore, we can summarize:

- Positions:
   - Position 3: I (correct)
   - Position 4: N (correct)
- Absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, O, T

Now, the secret word pattern is: ? ? I N ?

We need to fill in the first, second, and fifth positions with letters that are:
   - not C, R, A, E, P, O, T
   - and must be English letters.

Additionally, since we are constrained by the absent letters, we must choose from the remaining consonants and vowels. Note that vowels left: U, and sometimes Y. Consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note that Y can be used as a vowel or consonant.

Moreover, we must form a valid English word of the form: [letter1][letter2] I N [letter5]

Let's think of possible words:

The pattern: ? ? I N ?

We avoid the absent letters: so the first, second, and fifth positions must not contain C,R,A,E,P,O,T.

Consider common possibilities:

- For the first letter: possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, S, W, etc.
- For the second letter: similar, and consider common combinations.

Examples:

  ""SPI N"" -> but S? Wait, let's look: 
    The word could be: 
    S _ I N _ ? But the second letter cannot be O (absent) or T? Absent. 
    Possibilities: ""SPIN_"" -> but P is absent? So no: P is absent -> cannot use P.

  Instead, let's list words ending with ""IN"" (but note we need fifth letter).

  Common patterns: words like:
    ""BEGIN"": B-E-G-I-N? But position: E would be second? But E is absent -> invalid.
    ""CHAIN"": C present -> invalid, and A absent.
    ""BRING"": B-R-I-N-G -> R absent -> invalid.
    ""BLINK"": B-L-I-N-K -> L at second? But we have feedback that O and T are absent? Not in this. Now, letters: B, L, I, N, K -> I and N are set. Letters B, L, K are new. 
      Check absent: C,R,A,E,P,O,T -> B not absent? L not absent? K not absent? -> valid.
      Pattern: B(1) L(2) I(3) N(4) K(5) -> matches.

    ""S I N K"": S? But we need two letters before I? No: structure is ? ? I N ? -> so three letters: first, second, third=I, fourth=N, fifth=?
    ""S K I N"": would be first=S, second=K, third=I -> but then fourth? Not I? No.

    Actually, the word ""skin"" is S-K-I-N -> only four letters? No, we need five letters: positions are fixed: third is I, fourth is N? 
        Then what about ""SKINN"" (double N)? Not a word.

    So let's think of five-letter words having I in third and N in fourth.

    Other words:
      ""BAKIN"" -> not a word? Actually, ""baking"" is six letters.
      ""BEGIN"" doesn't work because E? 
      ""BLUIN"" -> not a word.
      ""QUINS"" -> Q-U-I-N-S: 
          Position: 1=Q, 2=U, 3=I (matches), 4=N (matches), 5=S -> but is ""quins"" a word? It is an uncommon word? We might avoid uncommon words.

    Another: ""WHINS"" -> W-H-I-N-S: 
        Position: W (1), H (2), I (3), N (4), S (5) -> good? Is it valid? ""whins"" is a word (a type of plant).

    But note: we have H and W, which we haven't tested? And no conflict.

    Other possibilities:
      ""BLIND"": B-L-I-N-D -> D at fifth? But letters: B, L, D -> as long as these are not absent? They are not. So valid.

    But wait, earlier feedback? We don't know about L? So it's okay.

    So we have two strong candidates:
      ""BLINK"": letters B, L, I, N, K -> positions: B(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), K(5)
      ""BLIND"": B(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), D(5)

    But how to choose? We need to test new letters? Also, note that we haven't tested: B, L, K, D, H, W, etc.

    We should also consider the frequency of letters? And if there are other constraints.

    After ""point"", we know that the solution pattern is: ? ? I N ?

    We must avoid the absent letters: C,R,A,E,P,O,T.

    Now, let's list all possible words? Not exhaustive, but we can think:

      Common words:
        ""BLINK""
        ""BLIND""
        ""BRING"" -> R absent -> invalid.
        ""BUILD"" -> U-I? But third letter I? BUILD: B-U-I-L-D -> then positions: B(1), U(2), I(3) -> matches, L(4)? but we need fourth=N -> L is fourth, not N -> no; also the fourth would be L -> but we require N in the fourth -> invalid.
        ""CHINK"": C? absent -> invalid.
        ""FLING"": F-L-I-N-G -> F(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), G(5) -> valid? G not absent? yes? But wait we haven't mentioned F, L, G.
        ""MINIM"" -> M-I-N-I-M: positions: M(1), I(2)? I(3)? ""MINIM"" -> M(1), I(2), N(3), I(4), M(5) -> doesn't match: we need third=I? This has second=I? and third=N? Then it would be I at second, N at third -> doesn't match.

        Actually, let's break down ""FLING"": F-L-I-N-G -> 
          1st: F, 2nd: L, 3rd: I -> yes, 4th: N -> yes, 5th: G -> good? But note ""G"" is allowed.

        So we have ""FLING"" as candidate.

      Another: ""KUZIN"" -> not common.

    Considering frequency and commonality:

      ""BLINK"" is a common word -> valid.

      Also ""BLIND"": common.

      ""FLING"": common.

      ""THYMI"" -> not valid? Not a word.

    However, we must choose one.

    Let me see which one gives more information:

      We want to test letters that are likely? Also, we have only one occurrence of I? But we know the position. And we know N.

      Our goal is to guess the entire word? But we have three positions unknown: first, second, and fifth.

      If we guess ""BLINK"", then:

        If the word is ""BLINK"", we win.
        Otherwise, we get feedback: 
          Which of B, L, K are correct? And the positions? But note, the fifth position might be something else.

      Similarly for ""BLIND"" or ""FLING"".

    Another candidate: ""OWING"" -> O is absent? Avoid O -> invalid.

    Let me think of more: 

      ""SWING"": S-W-I-N-G -> S(1), W(2), I(3), N(4), G(5) -> and O, T? No, we don't include O or T? So S,W,G are not absent -> valid? But wait: we have feedback that O and T are absent? So we are not using O or T -> correct? Yes.

    However, we already have:

        ""BLINK"": B,L,K
        ""BLIND"": B,L,D
        ""FLING"": F,L,G
        ""SWING"": S,W,G

    Also possible: ""BUYIN"" -> B-U-Y-I-N: B(1), U(2), Y(3) -> no: we need third letter I? This would be Y at third? Then I at fourth? -> invalid.

    So words where the third letter is I and fourth is N: so the structure is __ I N _

    Possible fifth letters: 
      We need one more letter at the end? For ""BLINK"", it's K; for ""BLIND"", D; ""FLING"", G; ""SWING"", G; ""WHINS"", S; ""QUINS"", S.

    We haven't tested: B, F, L, W, S, Q, etc.

    How to choose? We might prioritize letters we haven't tested that are common.

    We have already eliminated: A, E, O (vowels) -> so we have I and U (if it exists) and Y? 

    We haven't tested U and Y? So choosing a word with U or Y might give us vowel information.

    For example, ""BUILD"" doesn't fit? Because fourth letter is L, not N.

    ""QUINS"": Q-U-I-N-S -> Q not absent? And U is at position 2? Then position: 
        Q(1), U(2), I(3), N(4), S(5) -> good? And U is a vowel we haven't tested.

    Is ""QUINS"" a word? Yes, it's a variant of quint.

    But Q is rare? And U: it's the only vowel possibility? 

    Alternatively, we can choose a word with common consonants? Like S?

    We are also constrained by the fact that we must avoid the absent letters: C,R,A,E,P,O,T.

    Given we are on the third guess? We have 6 guesses total? So far we are making the third guess.

    Strategy: We want to maximize information? Or solve? Since we have three positions and many letters? A guess that covers more possibilities? 

    However, note: we have two positions open: first, second, fifth? Three letters? And we know third and fourth.

    Maybe we can try a word that uses common letters? And covers several possibilities?

    We list the most common letters we haven't tested? Remaining common consonants: S, L, D, M, B, G.

    We had in the first guess: tested C,R,A,N,E -> absent except N.
    Second guess: P,O,I,N,T -> absent except I,N.

    So letters tested: C,R,A,E,N,P,O,T (8 letters). But we know N and I are present? But I we already fixed? And N fixed? So the unknown letters are from the remaining.

    Total tested (and found absent): C,R,A,E,P,O,T -> 7 absent letters.

    Presents: I and N? And we know I and N are fixed? So the secret word has I and N? And two other letters? No: the secret word has five letters: 
        We only know positions 3 and 4. So the rest three are unknown? But we don't know if there are duplicates? But so far? We haven't seen duplicates.

    We can assume no duplicates? But sometimes words have duplicates? Let's be cautious? 

    Possibilities: the secret word has three letters: let's call them L1, L2, L5? They are distinct and not in the absent list? And not I or N? Because if they were I or N, they would appear again? 

    But wait: I and N are in positions 3 and 4? So they might appear only once? Or not? But we don't know? However, in our previous guesses? No duplicates? 

    We might assume that duplicate letters are not present because we have no feedback about duplicates? But that's not reliable.

    So we have to guess arbitrarily.

    Given the candidates:

      ""BLINK"": uses B, L, K
      ""BLIND"": uses B, L, D
      ""FLING"": F, L, G
      ""SWING"": S, W, G
      ""QUINS"": Q, U, S

    We want to get feedback that can help us? Because if we guess a word and get more ✓, we get closer? Or if we get x, we eliminate more.

    Choosing ""QUINS"" uses rare letters? U and Q? And S? It might be inefficient? Because Q is rare? So if we get all x? Then we know only the fixed positions? 

    Better to use common letters? So ""BLINK"", ""BLIND"", ""FLING"", ""SWING""? 

    How common?

      ""SWING"" has S, W, G? S is very common? W and G are medium? 
      ""FLING"" has F, L, G? F and L are common? 
      ""BLINK"" has B, L, K? L is common.
      ""BLIND"" has B, L, D? L is common.

    We haven't eliminated L? So ""L"" appears in many candidates? Therefore, testing L might be beneficial? 

    But note: if we guess a word with L, and if L is in the word? We get feedback? Otherwise we eliminate L.

    However, we have to guess the entire word? We might guess ""FLING"" or ""BLINK""? 

    Let me see frequency in the English language: E, T, A, O, I, N are already handled? But E,A,O,T absent? Then next: S, H, R (but R absent)? R is gone? So we have S common? 

    Therefore, including S might be good? So ""SWING""?

    But note: we haven't tested S? So we could guess ""SWING"": which uses S, W, I, N, G.

    However, the pattern: ? ? I N ? -> so ""SWING"": S at first? W at second? G at fifth? 

    Now? Do we have to use L? Not necessarily? 

    Consider: there might be words without L? 

    We don't know? 

    We can choose ""SWING"" to test S? Then if S is in the word? We get ✓ at position 1? etc.

    Alternative: we note that there aren't many words matching the pattern? So we might want to guess one of the common words? 

    A better approach: we can pick a word that uses letters that cover the possible words? 

    Since we don't know, we pick a common word? Let's pick ""BLINK"" or ""SWING""? 

    I'll go with ""BLINK"" because it has L? But L is also in other candidate words? 

    However, we haven't tested B, L, K? So we guess ""BLINK"" and see.

    If the word is ""BLINK"", we win? If not, we get feedback:

        First letter: if B is correct? Or in the word? But the first position might be another letter.
        Second letter: L? if present? etc.

    But note: we know position 3=I? Position 4=N? So positions 1 and 2 are what we test? And position 5=K? 

    So let's guess ""BLINK"".

<guess>blink</guess>
</think>  
### Analysis of Feedback:
From previous guesses:  
1. **crane**:  
   - C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x) → **N** is in position 4, and **C, R, A, E** are absent.  
2. **point**:  
   - P(x), O(x), I(✓), N(✓), T(x) → **I** is in position 3, **N** is in position 4, and **P, O, T** are absent.  

### Key Constraints:
- **Fixed positions**:  
  - Position 3: **I**  
  - Position 4: **N**  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, E, P, O, T  
- **Unknown positions**: 1, 2, and 5.  

### Strategy:
- The secret word follows the pattern: `[?][?] I N [?]`  
- Choose a word that:  
  - Fits `[?][?] I N [?]`  
  - Uses only letters **not** in the absent set (C, R, A, E, P, O, T).  
  - Prioritizes common letters and maximizes new information (e.g., testing frequent untested letters like S, L, B).  
- Possible candidates:  
  - **BLINK** (tests B, L, K; valid English word with ""I"" at position 3 and ""N"" at position 4).  
  - **BLIND** (tests B, L, D).  
  - **SWING** (tests S, W, G).  
  - **FLING** (tests F, L, G).  
- **Why BLINK?**  
  - **B**, **L**, **K** are common untested letters.  
  - ""L"" appears in multiple candidates (e.g., BLIND, FLING), so testing it could resolve ambiguity.  
  - ""BLINK"" is a high-frequency word that fits the pattern.  

### Next Guess:
Guess **BLINK** to test key new letters (B, L, K) in positions 1, 2, and 5.

<guess>blink</guess>",blink,"We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
Second guess: ""point"" -> Feedback: P(x) O(x) I(✓) N(✓) T(x)

From this, we know:

1. The secret word has the **fourth letter (position 4) as N**. 
2. The secret word has the **third letter (position 3) as I** (since in ""point"", I is at position 3, and it got a ✓).
3. Letters **C, R, A, E, P, O, T** are **not** in the word (based on both feedbacks).
   - Specifically, absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, O, T.

Therefore, we can summarize:

- Positions:
   - Position 3: I (correct)
   - Position 4: N (correct)
- Absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, O, T

Now, the secret word pattern is: ? ? I N ?

We need to fill in the first, second, and fifth positions with letters that are:
   - not C, R, A, E, P, O, T
   - and must be English letters.

Additionally, since we are constrained by the absent letters, we must choose from the remaining consonants and vowels. Note that vowels left: U, and sometimes Y. Consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note that Y can be used as a vowel or consonant.

Moreover, we must form a valid English word of the form: [letter1][letter2] I N [letter5]

Let's think of possible words:

The pattern: ? ? I N ?

We avoid the absent letters: so the first, second, and fifth positions must not contain C,R,A,E,P,O,T.

Consider common possibilities:

- For the first letter: possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, S, W, etc.
- For the second letter: similar, and consider common combinations.

Examples:

  ""SPI N"" -> but S? Wait, let's look: 
    The word could be: 
    S _ I N _ ? But the second letter cannot be O (absent) or T? Absent. 
    Possibilities: ""SPIN_"" -> but P is absent? So no: P is absent -> cannot use P.

  Instead, let's list words ending with ""IN"" (but note we need fifth letter).

  Common patterns: words like:
    ""BEGIN"": B-E-G-I-N? But position: E would be second? But E is absent -> invalid.
    ""CHAIN"": C present -> invalid, and A absent.
    ""BRING"": B-R-I-N-G -> R absent -> invalid.
    ""BLINK"": B-L-I-N-K -> L at second? But we have feedback that O and T are absent? Not in this. Now, letters: B, L, I, N, K -> I and N are set. Letters B, L, K are new. 
      Check absent: C,R,A,E,P,O,T -> B not absent? L not absent? K not absent? -> valid.
      Pattern: B(1) L(2) I(3) N(4) K(5) -> matches.

    ""S I N K"": S? But we need two letters before I? No: structure is ? ? I N ? -> so three letters: first, second, third=I, fourth=N, fifth=?
    ""S K I N"": would be first=S, second=K, third=I -> but then fourth? Not I? No.

    Actually, the word ""skin"" is S-K-I-N -> only four letters? No, we need five letters: positions are fixed: third is I, fourth is N? 
        Then what about ""SKINN"" (double N)? Not a word.

    So let's think of five-letter words having I in third and N in fourth.

    Other words:
      ""BAKIN"" -> not a word? Actually, ""baking"" is six letters.
      ""BEGIN"" doesn't work because E? 
      ""BLUIN"" -> not a word.
      ""QUINS"" -> Q-U-I-N-S: 
          Position: 1=Q, 2=U, 3=I (matches), 4=N (matches), 5=S -> but is ""quins"" a word? It is an uncommon word? We might avoid uncommon words.

    Another: ""WHINS"" -> W-H-I-N-S: 
        Position: W (1), H (2), I (3), N (4), S (5) -> good? Is it valid? ""whins"" is a word (a type of plant).

    But note: we have H and W, which we haven't tested? And no conflict.

    Other possibilities:
      ""BLIND"": B-L-I-N-D -> D at fifth? But letters: B, L, D -> as long as these are not absent? They are not. So valid.

    But wait, earlier feedback? We don't know about L? So it's okay.

    So we have two strong candidates:
      ""BLINK"": letters B, L, I, N, K -> positions: B(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), K(5)
      ""BLIND"": B(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), D(5)

    But how to choose? We need to test new letters? Also, note that we haven't tested: B, L, K, D, H, W, etc.

    We should also consider the frequency of letters? And if there are other constraints.

    After ""point"", we know that the solution pattern is: ? ? I N ?

    We must avoid the absent letters: C,R,A,E,P,O,T.

    Now, let's list all possible words? Not exhaustive, but we can think:

      Common words:
        ""BLINK""
        ""BLIND""
        ""BRING"" -> R absent -> invalid.
        ""BUILD"" -> U-I? But third letter I? BUILD: B-U-I-L-D -> then positions: B(1), U(2), I(3) -> matches, L(4)? but we need fourth=N -> L is fourth, not N -> no; also the fourth would be L -> but we require N in the fourth -> invalid.
        ""CHINK"": C? absent -> invalid.
        ""FLING"": F-L-I-N-G -> F(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), G(5) -> valid? G not absent? yes? But wait we haven't mentioned F, L, G.
        ""MINIM"" -> M-I-N-I-M: positions: M(1), I(2)? I(3)? ""MINIM"" -> M(1), I(2), N(3), I(4), M(5) -> doesn't match: we need third=I? This has second=I? and third=N? Then it would be I at second, N at third -> doesn't match.

        Actually, let's break down ""FLING"": F-L-I-N-G -> 
          1st: F, 2nd: L, 3rd: I -> yes, 4th: N -> yes, 5th: G -> good? But note ""G"" is allowed.

        So we have ""FLING"" as candidate.

      Another: ""KUZIN"" -> not common.

    Considering frequency and commonality:

      ""BLINK"" is a common word -> valid.

      Also ""BLIND"": common.

      ""FLING"": common.

      ""THYMI"" -> not valid? Not a word.

    However, we must choose one.

    Let me see which one gives more information:

      We want to test letters that are likely? Also, we have only one occurrence of I? But we know the position. And we know N.

      Our goal is to guess the entire word? But we have three positions unknown: first, second, and fifth.

      If we guess ""BLINK"", then:

        If the word is ""BLINK"", we win.
        Otherwise, we get feedback: 
          Which of B, L, K are correct? And the positions? But note, the fifth position might be something else.

      Similarly for ""BLIND"" or ""FLING"".

    Another candidate: ""OWING"" -> O is absent? Avoid O -> invalid.

    Let me think of more: 

      ""SWING"": S-W-I-N-G -> S(1), W(2), I(3), N(4), G(5) -> and O, T? No, we don't include O or T? So S,W,G are not absent -> valid? But wait: we have feedback that O and T are absent? So we are not using O or T -> correct? Yes.

    However, we already have:

        ""BLINK"": B,L,K
        ""BLIND"": B,L,D
        ""FLING"": F,L,G
        ""SWING"": S,W,G

    Also possible: ""BUYIN"" -> B-U-Y-I-N: B(1), U(2), Y(3) -> no: we need third letter I? This would be Y at third? Then I at fourth? -> invalid.

    So words where the third letter is I and fourth is N: so the structure is __ I N _

    Possible fifth letters: 
      We need one more letter at the end? For ""BLINK"", it's K; for ""BLIND"", D; ""FLING"", G; ""SWING"", G; ""WHINS"", S; ""QUINS"", S.

    We haven't tested: B, F, L, W, S, Q, etc.

    How to choose? We might prioritize letters we haven't tested that are common.

    We have already eliminated: A, E, O (vowels) -> so we have I and U (if it exists) and Y? 

    We haven't tested U and Y? So choosing a word with U or Y might give us vowel information.

    For example, ""BUILD"" doesn't fit? Because fourth letter is L, not N.

    ""QUINS"": Q-U-I-N-S -> Q not absent? And U is at position 2? Then position: 
        Q(1), U(2), I(3), N(4), S(5) -> good? And U is a vowel we haven't tested.

    Is ""QUINS"" a word? Yes, it's a variant of quint.

    But Q is rare? And U: it's the only vowel possibility? 

    Alternatively, we can choose a word with common consonants? Like S?

    We are also constrained by the fact that we must avoid the absent letters: C,R,A,E,P,O,T.

    Given we are on the third guess? We have 6 guesses total? So far we are making the third guess.

    Strategy: We want to maximize information? Or solve? Since we have three positions and many letters? A guess that covers more possibilities? 

    However, note: we have two positions open: first, second, fifth? Three letters? And we know third and fourth.

    Maybe we can try a word that uses common letters? And covers several possibilities?

    We list the most common letters we haven't tested? Remaining common consonants: S, L, D, M, B, G.

    We had in the first guess: tested C,R,A,N,E -> absent except N.
    Second guess: P,O,I,N,T -> absent except I,N.

    So letters tested: C,R,A,E,N,P,O,T (8 letters). But we know N and I are present? But I we already fixed? And N fixed? So the unknown letters are from the remaining.

    Total tested (and found absent): C,R,A,E,P,O,T -> 7 absent letters.

    Presents: I and N? And we know I and N are fixed? So the secret word has I and N? And two other letters? No: the secret word has five letters: 
        We only know positions 3 and 4. So the rest three are unknown? But we don't know if there are duplicates? But so far? We haven't seen duplicates.

    We can assume no duplicates? But sometimes words have duplicates? Let's be cautious? 

    Possibilities: the secret word has three letters: let's call them L1, L2, L5? They are distinct and not in the absent list? And not I or N? Because if they were I or N, they would appear again? 

    But wait: I and N are in positions 3 and 4? So they might appear only once? Or not? But we don't know? However, in our previous guesses? No duplicates? 

    We might assume that duplicate letters are not present because we have no feedback about duplicates? But that's not reliable.

    So we have to guess arbitrarily.

    Given the candidates:

      ""BLINK"": uses B, L, K
      ""BLIND"": uses B, L, D
      ""FLING"": F, L, G
      ""SWING"": S, W, G
      ""QUINS"": Q, U, S

    We want to get feedback that can help us? Because if we guess a word and get more ✓, we get closer? Or if we get x, we eliminate more.

    Choosing ""QUINS"" uses rare letters? U and Q? And S? It might be inefficient? Because Q is rare? So if we get all x? Then we know only the fixed positions? 

    Better to use common letters? So ""BLINK"", ""BLIND"", ""FLING"", ""SWING""? 

    How common?

      ""SWING"" has S, W, G? S is very common? W and G are medium? 
      ""FLING"" has F, L, G? F and L are common? 
      ""BLINK"" has B, L, K? L is common.
      ""BLIND"" has B, L, D? L is common.

    We haven't eliminated L? So ""L"" appears in many candidates? Therefore, testing L might be beneficial? 

    But note: if we guess a word with L, and if L is in the word? We get feedback? Otherwise we eliminate L.

    However, we have to guess the entire word? We might guess ""FLING"" or ""BLINK""? 

    Let me see frequency in the English language: E, T, A, O, I, N are already handled? But E,A,O,T absent? Then next: S, H, R (but R absent)? R is gone? So we have S common? 

    Therefore, including S might be good? So ""SWING""?

    But note: we haven't tested S? So we could guess ""SWING"": which uses S, W, I, N, G.

    However, the pattern: ? ? I N ? -> so ""SWING"": S at first? W at second? G at fifth? 

    Now? Do we have to use L? Not necessarily? 

    Consider: there might be words without L? 

    We don't know? 

    We can choose ""SWING"" to test S? Then if S is in the word? We get ✓ at position 1? etc.

    Alternative: we note that there aren't many words matching the pattern? So we might want to guess one of the common words? 

    A better approach: we can pick a word that uses letters that cover the possible words? 

    Since we don't know, we pick a common word? Let's pick ""BLINK"" or ""SWING""? 

    I'll go with ""BLINK"" because it has L? But L is also in other candidate words? 

    However, we haven't tested B, L, K? So we guess ""BLINK"" and see.

    If the word is ""BLINK"", we win? If not, we get feedback:

        First letter: if B is correct? Or in the word? But the first position might be another letter.
        Second letter: L? if present? etc.

    But note: we know position 3=I? Position 4=N? So positions 1 and 2 are what we test? And position 5=K? 

    So let's guess ""BLINK"".

<guess>blink</guess>### Analysis of Feedback:
From previous guesses:  
1. **crane**:  
   - C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x) → **N** is in position 4, and **C, R, A, E** are absent.  
2. **point**:  
   - P(x), O(x), I(✓), N(✓), T(x) → **I** is in position 3, **N** is in position 4, and **P, O, T** are absent.  

### Key Constraints:
- **Fixed positions**:  
  - Position 3: **I**  
  - Position 4: **N**  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, E, P, O, T  
- **Unknown positions**: 1, 2, and 5.  

### Strategy:
- The secret word follows the pattern: `[?][?] I N [?]`  
- Choose a word that:  
  - Fits `[?][?] I N [?]`  
  - Uses only letters **not** in the absent set (C, R, A, E, P, O, T).  
  - Prioritizes common letters and maximizes new information (e.g., testing frequent untested letters like S, L, B).  
- Possible candidates:  
  - **BLINK** (tests B, L, K; valid English word with ""I"" at position 3 and ""N"" at position 4).  
  - **BLIND** (tests B, L, D).  
  - **SWING** (tests S, W, G).  
  - **FLING** (tests F, L, G).  
- **Why BLINK?**  
  - **B**, **L**, **K** are common untested letters.  
  - ""L"" appears in multiple candidates (e.g., BLIND, FLING), so testing it could resolve ambiguity.  
  - ""BLINK"" is a high-frequency word that fits the pattern.  

### Next Guess:
Guess **BLINK** to test key new letters (B, L, K) in positions 1, 2, and 5.",Guess 3: blink -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(✓) I(✓) N(✓) K(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,FLING,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess:
 Guess: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)

 This means:
  C is not in the secret word -> x
  R is not in the secret word -> x
  A is not in the secret word -> x
  N is in the word and in the correct position -> ✓ (fourth letter)
  E is not in the secret word -> x

 So, we know:
  1. The fourth letter of the secret word is N.
  2. The letters C, R, A, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, we must avoid using C, R, A, E in our next guess.

 Also, since N is in the fourth position, our next guess must have N in the fourth position.

 Now, we need to choose a word that:
  - Has N as the fourth letter.
  - Contains only letters that are not C, R, A, E (and possibly other excluded letters, but so far only these).
  - Uses other common letters to maximize information.

 Since we have eliminated some vowels (A, E), we have left: vowels -> I, O, U (and sometimes Y).
 Consonants: many left, such as B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We also know that the word does not contain R, so we avoid that.

 Let's think of words that have N in the fourth position.

 Common pattern: _ _ _ N _

 We have to fill in the first, second, third, and fifth positions.

 We should avoid letters that are known to be absent: C, R, A, E.

 Possible words? Let's brainstorm:

  - Using common letters: S, T, L, O, P, etc.

 Examples:
  ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> This has no C,R,A,E and N at the fourth position? 
    Breakdown: 
      Position: 1: P, 2: O, 3: I, 4: N, 5: T
    But wait, our feedback only said N is in the fourth position, but the word ""point"" has N at the fourth? Actually, yes: 
      P (1st), O (2nd), I (3rd), N (4th), T (5th). So that fits.

  Other possibilities:
    ""JOINT"": J, O, I, N, T -> also okay, but J is less common.
    ""MOUNT"": M, O, U, N, T -> avoids the bad letters? M,O,U,N,T: no C,R,A,E -> okay.
    ""COUNT"": But C is excluded -> not allowed, because C is absent in the secret word.

 We must avoid C, so ""count"" is out.

 Other words: ""BLUNT"", ""FLINT"", ""GRANT"" (but G,R,A: R and A are excluded) -> so ""GRANT"" is invalid because of R and A.

 After eliminating, let's consider:

  ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> good.
  ""MOUNT"": M, O, U, N, T -> good.
  ""TOWNS"": T, O, W, N, S -> avoids bad letters? T,O,W,N,S: no C,R,A,E -> good.

 But note: the feedback for ""crane"" showed that N is in the correct position (fourth). So we must have N in the fourth.

 Now, we want to test for other common letters. Since we have eliminated A and E, we can test O and U (vowels) and common consonants like T, S, L, P, etc.

 Considering ""POINT"": 
   It lets us check P, O, I, T (in addition to the known N).

 ""MOUNT"": checks M, O, U, T.

 We might also consider ""MINTS"", but note the feedback only said N is in the fourth letter, and we don't know about duplicates. But the word ""minst"" isn't common? Actually, ""MINTS"": M-I-N-T-S. This has S at the end and T. But note: we are guessing and the word must be valid.

 However, we have to be cautious: we don't know if the word has repeated letters? But since we haven't encountered duplicates yet, we assume a word without duplication for now? Actually, the rules don't prohibit duplicates, but in this case we are guessing a new word without using the letters we know are absent.

 But note: we are limited by the fact that C, R, A, E cannot be in the word. Also, we must have N in the fourth position.

 Let's choose a word that uses letters we haven't tested so that we get more coverage.

 Previously in ""crane"", we tested C,R,A,N,E. Now we avoid those. So we want to use:

   Possible letters: 
     Vowels: I, O, U (and Y)
     Consonants: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,S,T,V,W,X,Y,Z

 However, we don't know about all letters. We tested: C,R,A,E -> absent.

 Now, if we choose ""POINT"", we are testing P, O, I, T (and N we know is in the fourth).

 If we choose ""MOUNT"", we test M, O, U, T.

 Another option: ""SHUNT"" (S,H,U,N,T) -> H and U are new.

 We need to get as many new letters as possible.

 Let's look for words that have many common letters we haven't tried.

 Considering common consonants: S, T, L are very common. We haven't tried S, T, L? 

 In ""crane"", we did T? No: C,R,A,N,E didn't include T.

 So we can try to include S and T and L.

 Example: ""POINT"" has T at the end? Yes.

 Or ""SPOIL"": but fourth letter must be N -> not N? No, wait: S-P-O-I-L -> fourth is I? So not N? Therefore, we must have fourth letter N.

 Another word: ""LUNTS"" -> L-U-N-T-S -> fourth letter is N? Let's see: 
   L (1), U (2), N (3), T (4), S (5) -> that would have N at the third, not fourth? 
   We need: _ _ _ N _ -> so the fourth is N, meaning positions: 
     1st: ?, 2nd: ?, 3rd: ?, 4th: N, 5th: ?

 So we need the fourth letter to be the fourth character: the third character can be any letter.

 Therefore, ""LUNTS"" would be: L-U-N-T? Then it would be L (1), U (2), N (3) -> but we need N at the fourth? So that doesn't fit.

 Actually, the word ""lunts"" is L-U-N-T: but that's five letters? 
   - Actually, it would be: position 1: L, 2: U, 3: N, 4: T, 5: S? 
   Then N is at the third? So not fourth.

 How about ""JOINS""? J-O-I-N-S: 
   Position: J (1), O (2), I (3), N (4), S (5) -> perfect.

 But J is less common, so maybe not the best.

 How about ""COINS""? But C is excluded -> invalid.

 How about ""POINT"": P-O-I-N-T -> P(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> this works.

 How about ""JOINT""? Same as above but J. 

 Another word: ""TAWNY"": T-A-W-N-Y -> but A is excluded -> invalid.

 ""DOWNY"": D-O-W-N-Y -> D(1), O(2), W(3), N(4), Y(5). This avoids excluded letters? 
   D: not excluded? 
   O: okay.
   W: okay.
   N: okay (but already known at fourth).
   Y: okay.

 But wait, we have to avoid A and E? Yes. So ""DOWNY"" is acceptable? 
   However, we know A is excluded, so ""DOWNY"" doesn't have A or the others.

 So ""DOWNY"" is a candidate.

 However, we don't want to use too many rare letters? And we are trying to get information.

 Let me compare:

  Candidate words:

   ""POINT"": letters -> P, O, I, T (and N)
   ""JOINT"": J is rare -> avoid?
   ""DOWNY"": D, O, W, Y -> D and W and Y are not as common? But why not? They are valid.

   Another one: ""TOWN'S"" isn't valid? ""TOWNS"": T-O-W-N-S -> T(1), O(2), W(3), N(4), S(5) -> good.

   ""MINUS"": M-I-N-U-S -> M(1), I(2), N(3), U(4), S(5) -> N is at the third? Not fourth -> invalid.

 So we must have the fourth letter N.

 Another candidate: ""BORNS""? But B-O-R-N-S: R is excluded? We have R in ""crane"" and feedback said R is not in the word -> so cannot use R.

 Therefore, ""BORNS"" is invalid.

 How about ""SONGS""? S-O-N-G-S: the fourth letter is the fourth character: 
   S(1), O(2), N(3) -> wait, then G(4), S(5)? So N is at third? And G at fourth? Not correct.

 We must have the fourth letter being N: the word must be in the form ???N?.

 So ""SONGS"" doesn't have the fourth letter as N? Actually, 
   S -> first
   O -> second
   N -> third? 
   G -> fourth
   S -> fifth

 So we need the N in the fourth? So if we had ""SOGND"" that doesn't make sense.

 Another candidate: ""BUNKS"": B-U-N-K-S -> B(1), U(2), N(3) -> N is third? Then K(4), S(5) -> no.

 ""PUNKS"": same problem: P(1), U(2), N(3), K(4), S(5) -> N at third.

 How about ""PLANK"": P-L-A-N-K -> but A is excluded -> invalid.

 ""BLINK"": B-L-I-N-K -> B(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), K(5) -> good. However, we haven't eliminated B,L,I,K? No, because only C,R,A,E are gone. So valid.

 But note: we don't know if the word has I or not? So ""BLINK"" is a candidate.

 Now, comparing:

   POINT: uses P,O,I,T
   BLINK: uses B,L,I,N,K -> but we already know N? But we are testing B,L,I,K.
   TOWNS: uses T,O,W,N,S

 We want to maximize coverage of new letters.

 Previously used: C, R, A, N, E (but N is known, and the others absent except N).
 So we have used 5 letters: C,R,A,N,E.

 For the next guess, we can include N because we know it's in the word and we are using it in the correct position? But we are also testing other letters.

 Idea: choose a word that uses as many new letters as possible.

 Considering:

   POINT: P, O, I, T -> all new? and N (we know is present, so only feedback on new letters).

   BLINK: B, L, I, K -> and N -> all new? 

   TOWNS: T, O, W, N, S -> T, O, W, S new.

 But note: in BLINK, the letter I is at the third position? We are testing I? That's fine.

 However, we are only on the second guess, so we don't have many constraints.

 I think ""POINT"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters.

 Another candidate: ""SPOIL"" -> but we need fourth letter N? Not possible.

 Let's go with ""POINT"". It has the form: 
   Position 1: P, Position 2: O, Position 3: I, Position 4: N, Position 5: T.

 This fits the pattern.

 So we guess ""POINT"".

<guess>point</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- **C, R, A, E** are **NOT** in the secret word (marked ""x"").  
- **N** is **CORRECTLY** placed in the 4th position (marked ""✓"").  

### Strategy for Second Guess:
- The secret word has **N in the 4th position** and excludes **C, R, A, E**.  
- Choose a word that:  
  - Has **N as the 4th letter**.  
  - Uses common unused letters (e.g., **S, T, L, O, P**, since vowels **I, O, U** are untested).  
  - Avoids **C, R, A, E**.  
- Good candidates: POINT, TOWN, JOINT, BLINK, MOUNT.  
- Selected **""POINT""** because it:  
  - Maximizes new common letters (**P, O, I, T**).  
  - Fits the constraint (N in position 4: P-O-**I-N-T**).  
  - Is a common English word.  

Now guessing ""POINT"" to test new positions and letters.

<guess>point</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(✓) N(✓) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
Second guess: ""point"" -> Feedback: P(x) O(x) I(✓) N(✓) T(x)

From this, we know:

1. The secret word has the **fourth letter (position 4) as N**. 
2. The secret word has the **third letter (position 3) as I** (since in ""point"", I is at position 3, and it got a ✓).
3. Letters **C, R, A, E, P, O, T** are **not** in the word (based on both feedbacks).
   - Specifically, absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, O, T.

Therefore, we can summarize:

- Positions:
   - Position 3: I (correct)
   - Position 4: N (correct)
- Absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, O, T

Now, the secret word pattern is: ? ? I N ?

We need to fill in the first, second, and fifth positions with letters that are:
   - not C, R, A, E, P, O, T
   - and must be English letters.

Additionally, since we are constrained by the absent letters, we must choose from the remaining consonants and vowels. Note that vowels left: U, and sometimes Y. Consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note that Y can be used as a vowel or consonant.

Moreover, we must form a valid English word of the form: [letter1][letter2] I N [letter5]

Let's think of possible words:

The pattern: ? ? I N ?

We avoid the absent letters: so the first, second, and fifth positions must not contain C,R,A,E,P,O,T.

Consider common possibilities:

- For the first letter: possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, S, W, etc.
- For the second letter: similar, and consider common combinations.

Examples:

  ""SPI N"" -> but S? Wait, let's look: 
    The word could be: 
    S _ I N _ ? But the second letter cannot be O (absent) or T? Absent. 
    Possibilities: ""SPIN_"" -> but P is absent? So no: P is absent -> cannot use P.

  Instead, let's list words ending with ""IN"" (but note we need fifth letter).

  Common patterns: words like:
    ""BEGIN"": B-E-G-I-N? But position: E would be second? But E is absent -> invalid.
    ""CHAIN"": C present -> invalid, and A absent.
    ""BRING"": B-R-I-N-G -> R absent -> invalid.
    ""BLINK"": B-L-I-N-K -> L at second? But we have feedback that O and T are absent? Not in this. Now, letters: B, L, I, N, K -> I and N are set. Letters B, L, K are new. 
      Check absent: C,R,A,E,P,O,T -> B not absent? L not absent? K not absent? -> valid.
      Pattern: B(1) L(2) I(3) N(4) K(5) -> matches.

    ""S I N K"": S? But we need two letters before I? No: structure is ? ? I N ? -> so three letters: first, second, third=I, fourth=N, fifth=?
    ""S K I N"": would be first=S, second=K, third=I -> but then fourth? Not I? No.

    Actually, the word ""skin"" is S-K-I-N -> only four letters? No, we need five letters: positions are fixed: third is I, fourth is N? 
        Then what about ""SKINN"" (double N)? Not a word.

    So let's think of five-letter words having I in third and N in fourth.

    Other words:
      ""BAKIN"" -> not a word? Actually, ""baking"" is six letters.
      ""BEGIN"" doesn't work because E? 
      ""BLUIN"" -> not a word.
      ""QUINS"" -> Q-U-I-N-S: 
          Position: 1=Q, 2=U, 3=I (matches), 4=N (matches), 5=S -> but is ""quins"" a word? It is an uncommon word? We might avoid uncommon words.

    Another: ""WHINS"" -> W-H-I-N-S: 
        Position: W (1), H (2), I (3), N (4), S (5) -> good? Is it valid? ""whins"" is a word (a type of plant).

    But note: we have H and W, which we haven't tested? And no conflict.

    Other possibilities:
      ""BLIND"": B-L-I-N-D -> D at fifth? But letters: B, L, D -> as long as these are not absent? They are not. So valid.

    But wait, earlier feedback? We don't know about L? So it's okay.

    So we have two strong candidates:
      ""BLINK"": letters B, L, I, N, K -> positions: B(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), K(5)
      ""BLIND"": B(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), D(5)

    But how to choose? We need to test new letters? Also, note that we haven't tested: B, L, K, D, H, W, etc.

    We should also consider the frequency of letters? And if there are other constraints.

    After ""point"", we know that the solution pattern is: ? ? I N ?

    We must avoid the absent letters: C,R,A,E,P,O,T.

    Now, let's list all possible words? Not exhaustive, but we can think:

      Common words:
        ""BLINK""
        ""BLIND""
        ""BRING"" -> R absent -> invalid.
        ""BUILD"" -> U-I? But third letter I? BUILD: B-U-I-L-D -> then positions: B(1), U(2), I(3) -> matches, L(4)? but we need fourth=N -> L is fourth, not N -> no; also the fourth would be L -> but we require N in the fourth -> invalid.
        ""CHINK"": C? absent -> invalid.
        ""FLING"": F-L-I-N-G -> F(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), G(5) -> valid? G not absent? yes? But wait we haven't mentioned F, L, G.
        ""MINIM"" -> M-I-N-I-M: positions: M(1), I(2)? I(3)? ""MINIM"" -> M(1), I(2), N(3), I(4), M(5) -> doesn't match: we need third=I? This has second=I? and third=N? Then it would be I at second, N at third -> doesn't match.

        Actually, let's break down ""FLING"": F-L-I-N-G -> 
          1st: F, 2nd: L, 3rd: I -> yes, 4th: N -> yes, 5th: G -> good? But note ""G"" is allowed.

        So we have ""FLING"" as candidate.

      Another: ""KUZIN"" -> not common.

    Considering frequency and commonality:

      ""BLINK"" is a common word -> valid.

      Also ""BLIND"": common.

      ""FLING"": common.

      ""THYMI"" -> not valid? Not a word.

    However, we must choose one.

    Let me see which one gives more information:

      We want to test letters that are likely? Also, we have only one occurrence of I? But we know the position. And we know N.

      Our goal is to guess the entire word? But we have three positions unknown: first, second, and fifth.

      If we guess ""BLINK"", then:

        If the word is ""BLINK"", we win.
        Otherwise, we get feedback: 
          Which of B, L, K are correct? And the positions? But note, the fifth position might be something else.

      Similarly for ""BLIND"" or ""FLING"".

    Another candidate: ""OWING"" -> O is absent? Avoid O -> invalid.

    Let me think of more: 

      ""SWING"": S-W-I-N-G -> S(1), W(2), I(3), N(4), G(5) -> and O, T? No, we don't include O or T? So S,W,G are not absent -> valid? But wait: we have feedback that O and T are absent? So we are not using O or T -> correct? Yes.

    However, we already have:

        ""BLINK"": B,L,K
        ""BLIND"": B,L,D
        ""FLING"": F,L,G
        ""SWING"": S,W,G

    Also possible: ""BUYIN"" -> B-U-Y-I-N: B(1), U(2), Y(3) -> no: we need third letter I? This would be Y at third? Then I at fourth? -> invalid.

    So words where the third letter is I and fourth is N: so the structure is __ I N _

    Possible fifth letters: 
      We need one more letter at the end? For ""BLINK"", it's K; for ""BLIND"", D; ""FLING"", G; ""SWING"", G; ""WHINS"", S; ""QUINS"", S.

    We haven't tested: B, F, L, W, S, Q, etc.

    How to choose? We might prioritize letters we haven't tested that are common.

    We have already eliminated: A, E, O (vowels) -> so we have I and U (if it exists) and Y? 

    We haven't tested U and Y? So choosing a word with U or Y might give us vowel information.

    For example, ""BUILD"" doesn't fit? Because fourth letter is L, not N.

    ""QUINS"": Q-U-I-N-S -> Q not absent? And U is at position 2? Then position: 
        Q(1), U(2), I(3), N(4), S(5) -> good? And U is a vowel we haven't tested.

    Is ""QUINS"" a word? Yes, it's a variant of quint.

    But Q is rare? And U: it's the only vowel possibility? 

    Alternatively, we can choose a word with common consonants? Like S?

    We are also constrained by the fact that we must avoid the absent letters: C,R,A,E,P,O,T.

    Given we are on the third guess? We have 6 guesses total? So far we are making the third guess.

    Strategy: We want to maximize information? Or solve? Since we have three positions and many letters? A guess that covers more possibilities? 

    However, note: we have two positions open: first, second, fifth? Three letters? And we know third and fourth.

    Maybe we can try a word that uses common letters? And covers several possibilities?

    We list the most common letters we haven't tested? Remaining common consonants: S, L, D, M, B, G.

    We had in the first guess: tested C,R,A,N,E -> absent except N.
    Second guess: P,O,I,N,T -> absent except I,N.

    So letters tested: C,R,A,E,N,P,O,T (8 letters). But we know N and I are present? But I we already fixed? And N fixed? So the unknown letters are from the remaining.

    Total tested (and found absent): C,R,A,E,P,O,T -> 7 absent letters.

    Presents: I and N? And we know I and N are fixed? So the secret word has I and N? And two other letters? No: the secret word has five letters: 
        We only know positions 3 and 4. So the rest three are unknown? But we don't know if there are duplicates? But so far? We haven't seen duplicates.

    We can assume no duplicates? But sometimes words have duplicates? Let's be cautious? 

    Possibilities: the secret word has three letters: let's call them L1, L2, L5? They are distinct and not in the absent list? And not I or N? Because if they were I or N, they would appear again? 

    But wait: I and N are in positions 3 and 4? So they might appear only once? Or not? But we don't know? However, in our previous guesses? No duplicates? 

    We might assume that duplicate letters are not present because we have no feedback about duplicates? But that's not reliable.

    So we have to guess arbitrarily.

    Given the candidates:

      ""BLINK"": uses B, L, K
      ""BLIND"": uses B, L, D
      ""FLING"": F, L, G
      ""SWING"": S, W, G
      ""QUINS"": Q, U, S

    We want to get feedback that can help us? Because if we guess a word and get more ✓, we get closer? Or if we get x, we eliminate more.

    Choosing ""QUINS"" uses rare letters? U and Q? And S? It might be inefficient? Because Q is rare? So if we get all x? Then we know only the fixed positions? 

    Better to use common letters? So ""BLINK"", ""BLIND"", ""FLING"", ""SWING""? 

    How common?

      ""SWING"" has S, W, G? S is very common? W and G are medium? 
      ""FLING"" has F, L, G? F and L are common? 
      ""BLINK"" has B, L, K? L is common.
      ""BLIND"" has B, L, D? L is common.

    We haven't eliminated L? So ""L"" appears in many candidates? Therefore, testing L might be beneficial? 

    But note: if we guess a word with L, and if L is in the word? We get feedback? Otherwise we eliminate L.

    However, we have to guess the entire word? We might guess ""FLING"" or ""BLINK""? 

    Let me see frequency in the English language: E, T, A, O, I, N are already handled? But E,A,O,T absent? Then next: S, H, R (but R absent)? R is gone? So we have S common? 

    Therefore, including S might be good? So ""SWING""?

    But note: we haven't tested S? So we could guess ""SWING"": which uses S, W, I, N, G.

    However, the pattern: ? ? I N ? -> so ""SWING"": S at first? W at second? G at fifth? 

    Now? Do we have to use L? Not necessarily? 

    Consider: there might be words without L? 

    We don't know? 

    We can choose ""SWING"" to test S? Then if S is in the word? We get ✓ at position 1? etc.

    Alternative: we note that there aren't many words matching the pattern? So we might want to guess one of the common words? 

    A better approach: we can pick a word that uses letters that cover the possible words? 

    Since we don't know, we pick a common word? Let's pick ""BLINK"" or ""SWING""? 

    I'll go with ""BLINK"" because it has L? But L is also in other candidate words? 

    However, we haven't tested B, L, K? So we guess ""BLINK"" and see.

    If the word is ""BLINK"", we win? If not, we get feedback:

        First letter: if B is correct? Or in the word? But the first position might be another letter.
        Second letter: L? if present? etc.

    But note: we know position 3=I? Position 4=N? So positions 1 and 2 are what we test? And position 5=K? 

    So let's guess ""BLINK"".

<guess>blink</guess>### Analysis of Feedback:
From previous guesses:  
1. **crane**:  
   - C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x) → **N** is in position 4, and **C, R, A, E** are absent.  
2. **point**:  
   - P(x), O(x), I(✓), N(✓), T(x) → **I** is in position 3, **N** is in position 4, and **P, O, T** are absent.  

### Key Constraints:
- **Fixed positions**:  
  - Position 3: **I**  
  - Position 4: **N**  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, E, P, O, T  
- **Unknown positions**: 1, 2, and 5.  

### Strategy:
- The secret word follows the pattern: `[?][?] I N [?]`  
- Choose a word that:  
  - Fits `[?][?] I N [?]`  
  - Uses only letters **not** in the absent set (C, R, A, E, P, O, T).  
  - Prioritizes common letters and maximizes new information (e.g., testing frequent untested letters like S, L, B).  
- Possible candidates:  
  - **BLINK** (tests B, L, K; valid English word with ""I"" at position 3 and ""N"" at position 4).  
  - **BLIND** (tests B, L, D).  
  - **SWING** (tests S, W, G).  
  - **FLING** (tests F, L, G).  
- **Why BLINK?**  
  - **B**, **L**, **K** are common untested letters.  
  - ""L"" appears in multiple candidates (e.g., BLIND, FLING), so testing it could resolve ambiguity.  
  - ""BLINK"" is a high-frequency word that fits the pattern.  

### Next Guess:
Guess **BLINK** to test key new letters (B, L, K) in positions 1, 2, and 5.

Let\'s brainstorm:\n\n  - Using common letters: S, T, L, O, P, etc.\n\n Examples:\n  ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> This has no C,R,A,E and N at the fourth position? \n    Breakdown: \n      Position: 1: P, 2: O, 3: I, 4: N, 5: T\n    But wait, our feedback only said N is in the fourth position, but the word ""point"" has N at the fourth? Actually, yes: \n      P (1st), O (2nd), I (3rd), N (4th), T (5th). So that fits.\n\n  Other possibilities:\n    ""JOINT"": J, O, I, N, T -> also okay, but J is less common.\n    ""MOUNT"": M, O, U, N, T -> avoids the bad letters? M,O,U,N,T: no C,R,A,E -> okay.\n    ""COUNT"": But C is excluded -> not allowed, because C is absent in the secret word.\n\n We must avoid C, so ""count"" is out.\n\n Other words: ""BLUNT"", ""FLINT"", ""GRANT"" (but G,R,A: R and A are excluded) -> so ""GRANT"" is invalid because of R and A.\n\n After eliminating, let\'s consider:\n\n  ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> good.\n  ""MOUNT"": M, O, U, N, T -> good.\n  ""TOWNS"": T, O, W, N, S -> avoids bad letters? T,O,W,N,S: no C,R,A,E -> good.\n\n But note: the feedback for ""crane"" showed that N is in the correct position (fourth). So we must have N in the fourth.\n\n Now, we want to test for other common letters. Since we have eliminated A and E, we can test O and U (vowels) and common consonants like T, S, L, P, etc.\n\n Considering ""POINT"": \n   It lets us check P, O, I, T (in addition to the known N).\n\n ""MOUNT"": checks M, O, U, T.\n\n We might also consider ""MINTS"", but note the feedback only said N is in the fourth letter, and we don\'t know about duplicates. But the word ""minst"" isn\'t common? Actually, ""MINTS"": M-I-N-T-S. This has S at the end and T. But note: we are guessing and the word must be valid.\n\n However, we have to be cautious: we don\'t know if the word has repeated letters? But since we haven\'t encountered duplicates yet, we assume a word without duplication for now? Actually, the rules don\'t prohibit duplicates, but in this case we are guessing a new word without using the letters we know are absent.\n\n But note: we are limited by the fact that C, R, A, E cannot be in the word. Also, we must have N in the fourth position.\n\n Let\'s choose a word that uses letters we haven\'t tested so that we get more coverage.\n\n Previously in ""crane"", we tested C,R,A,N,E. Now we avoid those. So we want to use:\n\n   Possible letters: \n     Vowels: I, O, U (and Y)\n     Consonants: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,S,T,V,W,X,Y,Z\n\n However, we don\'t know about all letters. We tested: C,R,A,E -> absent.\n\n Now, if we choose ""POINT"", we are testing P, O, I, T (and N we know is in the fourth).\n\n If we choose ""MOUNT"", we test M, O, U, T.\n\n Another option: ""SHUNT"" (S,H,U,N,T) -> H and U are new.\n\n We need to get as many new letters as possible.\n\n Let\'s look for words that have many common letters we haven\'t tried.\n\n Considering common consonants: S, T, L are very common. We haven\'t tried S, T, L? \n\n In ""crane"", we did T? No: C,R,A,N,E didn\'t include T.\n\n So we can try to include S and T and L.\n\n Example: ""POINT"" has T at the end? Yes.\n\n Or ""SPOIL"": but fourth letter must be N -> not N? No, wait: S-P-O-I-L -> fourth is I? So not N? Therefore, we must have fourth letter N.\n\n Another word: ""LUNTS"" -> L-U-N-T-S -> fourth letter is N? Let\'s see: \n   L (1), U (2), N (3), T (4), S (5) -> that would have N at the third, not fourth? \n   We need: _ _ _ N _ -> so the fourth is N, meaning positions: \n     1st: ?, 2nd: ?, 3rd: ?, 4th: N, 5th: ?\n\n So we need the fourth letter to be the fourth character: the third character can be any letter.\n\n Therefore, ""LUNTS"" would be: L-U-N-T? Then it would be L (1), U (2), N (3) -> but we need N at the fourth? So that doesn\'t fit.\n\n Actually, the word ""lunts"" is L-U-N-T: but that\'s five letters? \n   - Actually, it would be: position 1: L, 2: U, 3: N, 4: T, 5: S? \n   Then N is at the third? So not fourth.\n\n How about ""JOINS""? J-O-I-N-S: \n   Position: J (1), O (2), I (3), N (4), S (5) -> perfect.\n\n But J is less common, so maybe not the best.\n\n How about ""COINS""? But C is excluded -> invalid.\n\n How about ""POINT"": P-O-I-N-T -> P(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> this works.\n\n How about ""JOINT""? Same as above but J. \n\n Another word: ""TAWNY"": T-A-W-N-Y -> but A is excluded -> invalid.\n\n ""DOWNY"": D-O-W-N-Y -> D(1), O(2), W(3), N(4), Y(5). This avoids excluded letters? \n   D: not excluded? \n   O: okay.\n   W: okay.\n   N: okay (but already known at fourth).\n   Y: okay.\n\n But wait, we have to avoid A and E? Yes. So ""DOWNY"" is acceptable? \n   However, we know A is excluded, so ""DOWNY"" doesn\'t have A or the others.\n\n So ""DOWNY"" is a candidate.\n\n However, we don\'t want to use too many rare letters? And we are trying to get information.\n\n Let me compare:\n\n  Candidate words:\n\n   ""POINT"": letters -> P, O, I, T (and N)\n   ""JOINT"": J is rare -> avoid?\n   ""DOWNY"": D, O, W, Y -> D and W and Y are not as common? But why not? They are valid.\n\n   Another one: ""TOWN\'S"" isn\'t valid? ""TOWNS"": T-O-W-N-S -> T(1), O(2), W(3), N(4), S(5) -> good.\n\n   ""MINUS"": M-I-N-U-S -> M(1), I(2), N(3), U(4), S(5) -> N is at the third? Not fourth -> invalid.\n\n So we must have the fourth letter N.\n\n Another candidate: ""BORNS""? But B-O-R-N-S: R is excluded? We have R in ""crane"" and feedback said R is not in the word -> so cannot use R.\n\n Therefore, ""BORNS"" is invalid.\n\n How about ""SONGS""? S-O-N-G-S: the fourth letter is the fourth character: \n   S(1), O(2), N(3) -> wait, then G(4), S(5)? So N is at third? And G at fourth? Not correct.\n\n We must have the fourth letter being N: the word must be in the form ???N?.\n\n So ""SONGS"" doesn\'t have the fourth letter as N? Actually, \n   S -> first\n   O -> second\n   N -> third? \n   G -> fourth\n   S -> fifth\n\n So we need the N in the fourth? So if we had ""SOGND"" that doesn\'t make sense.\n\n Another candidate: ""BUNKS"": B-U-N-K-S -> B(1), U(2), N(3) -> N is third? Then K(4), S(5) -> no.\n\n ""PUNKS"": same problem: P(1), U(2), N(3), K(4), S(5) -> N at third.\n\n How about ""PLANK"": P-L-A-N-K -> but A is excluded -> invalid.\n\n ""BLINK"": B-L-I-N-K -> B(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), K(5) -> good. However, we haven\'t eliminated B,L,I,K? No, because only C,R,A,E are gone. So valid.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if the word has I or not? So ""BLINK"" is a candidate.\n\n Now, comparing:\n\n   POINT: uses P,O,I,T\n   BLINK: uses B,L,I,N,K -> but we already know N? But we are testing B,L,I,K.\n   TOWNS: uses T,O,W,N,S\n\n We want to maximize coverage of new letters.\n\n Previously used: C, R, A, N, E (but N is known, and the others absent except N).\n So we have used 5 letters: C,R,A,N,E.\n\n For the next guess, we can include N because we know it\'s in the word and we are using it in the correct position? But we are also testing other letters.\n\n Idea: choose a word that uses as many new letters as possible.\n\n Considering:\n\n   POINT: P, O, I, T -> all new? and N (we know is present, so only feedback on new letters).\n\n   BLINK: B, L, I, K -> and N -> all new? \n\n   TOWNS: T, O, W, N, S -> T, O, W, S new.\n\n But note: in BLINK, the letter I is at the third position? We are testing I? That\'s fine.\n\n However, we are only on the second guess, so we don\'t have many constraints.\n\n I think ""POINT"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters.\n\n Another candidate: ""SPOIL"" -> but we need fourth letter N? Not possible.\n\n Let\'s go with ""POINT"". It has the form: \n   Position 1: P, Position 2: O, Position 3: I, Position 4: N, Position 5: T.\n\n This fits the pattern.\n\n So we guess ""POINT"".\n\n<guess>point</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  \n- **C, R, A, E** are **NOT** in the secret word (marked ""x"").  \n- **N** is **CORRECTLY** placed in the 4th position (marked ""✓"").  \n\n### Strategy for Second Guess:\n- The secret word has **N in the 4th position** and excludes **C, R, A, E**.  \n- Choose a word that:  \n  - Has **N as the 4th letter**.  \n  - Uses common unused letters (e.g., **S, T, L, O, P**, since vowels **I, O, U** are untested).  \n  - Avoids **C, R, A, E**.  \n- Good candidates: POINT, TOWN, JOINT, BLINK, MOUNT.  \n- Selected **""POINT""** because it:  \n  - Maximizes new common letters (**P, O, I, T**).  \n  - Fits the constraint (N in position 4: P-O-**I-N-T**).  \n  - Is a common English word.  \n\nNow guessing ""POINT"" to test new positions and letters.\n\n<guess>point</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(✓) N(✓) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nFirst guess: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\nSecond guess: ""point"" -> Feedback: P(x) O(x) I(✓) N(✓) T(x)\n\nFrom this, we know:\n\n1. The secret word has the **fourth letter (position 4) as N**. \n2. The secret word has the **third letter (position 3) as I** (since in ""point"", I is at position 3, and it got a ✓).\n3. Letters **C, R, A, E, P, O, T** are **not** in the word (based on both feedbacks).\n   - Specifically, absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, O, T.\n\nTherefore, we can summarize:\n\n- Positions:\n   - Position 3: I (correct)\n   - Position 4: N (correct)\n- Absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, O, T\n\nNow, the secret word pattern is: ? ? I N ?\n\nWe need to fill in the first, second, and fifth positions with letters that are:\n   - not C, R, A, E, P, O, T\n   - and must be English letters.\n\nAdditionally, since we are constrained by the absent letters, we must choose from the remaining consonants and vowels. Note that vowels left: U, and sometimes Y. Consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut note that Y can be used as a vowel or consonant.\n\nMoreover, we must form a valid English word of the form: [letter1][letter2] I N [letter5]\n\nLet\'s think of possible words:\n\nThe pattern: ? ? I N ?\n\nWe avoid the absent letters: so the first, second, and fifth positions must not contain C,R,A,E,P,O,T.\n\nConsider common possibilities:\n\n- For the first letter: possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, S, W, etc.\n- For the second letter: similar, and consider common combinations.\n\nExamples:\n\n  ""SPI N"" -> but S? Wait, let\'s look: \n    The word could be: \n    S _ I N _ ? But the second letter cannot be O (absent) or T? Absent. \n    Possibilities: ""SPIN_"" -> but P is absent? So no: P is absent -> cannot use P.\n\n  Instead, let\'s list words ending with ""IN"" (but note we need fifth letter).\n\n  Common patterns: words like:\n    ""BEGIN"": B-E-G-I-N? But position: E would be second? But E is absent -> invalid.\n    ""CHAIN"": C present -> invalid, and A absent.\n    ""BRING"": B-R-I-N-G -> R absent -> invalid.\n    ""BLINK"": B-L-I-N-K -> L at second? But we have feedback that O and T are absent? Not in this. Now, letters: B, L, I, N, K -> I and N are set. Letters B, L, K are new. \n      Check absent: C,R,A,E,P,O,T -> B not absent? L not absent? K not absent? -> valid.\n      Pattern: B(1) L(2) I(3) N(4) K(5) -> matches.\n\n    ""S I N K"": S? But we need two letters before I? No: structure is ? ? I N ? -> so three letters: first, second, third=I, fourth=N, fifth=?\n    ""S K I N"": would be first=S, second=K, third=I -> but then fourth? Not I? No.\n\n    Actually, the word ""skin"" is S-K-I-N -> only four letters? No, we need five letters: positions are fixed: third is I, fourth is N? \n        Then what about ""SKINN"" (double N)? Not a word.\n\n    So let\'s think of five-letter words having I in third and N in fourth.\n\n    Other words:\n      ""BAKIN"" -> not a word? Actually, ""baking"" is six letters.\n      ""BEGIN"" doesn\'t work because E? \n      ""BLUIN"" -> not a word.\n      ""QUINS"" -> Q-U-I-N-S: \n          Position: 1=Q, 2=U, 3=I (matches), 4=N (matches), 5=S -> but is ""quins"" a word? It is an uncommon word? We might avoid uncommon words.\n\n    Another: ""WHINS"" -> W-H-I-N-S: \n        Position: W (1), H (2), I (3), N (4), S (5) -> good? Is it valid? ""whins"" is a word (a type of plant).\n\n    But note: we have H and W, which we haven\'t tested? And no conflict.\n\n    Other possibilities:\n      ""BLIND"": B-L-I-N-D -> D at fifth? But letters: B, L, D -> as long as these are not absent? They are not. So valid.\n\n    But wait, earlier feedback? We don\'t know about L? So it\'s okay.\n\n    So we have two strong candidates:\n      ""BLINK"": letters B, L, I, N, K -> positions: B(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), K(5)\n      ""BLIND"": B(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), D(5)\n\n    But how to choose? We need to test new letters? Also, note that we haven\'t tested: B, L, K, D, H, W, etc.\n\n    We should also consider the frequency of letters? And if there are other constraints.\n\n    After ""point"", we know that the solution pattern is: ? ? I N ?\n\n    We must avoid the absent letters: C,R,A,E,P,O,T.\n\n    Now, let\'s list all possible words? Not exhaustive, but we can think:\n\n      Common words:\n        ""BLINK""\n        ""BLIND""\n        ""BRING"" -> R absent -> invalid.\n        ""BUILD"" -> U-I? But third letter I? BUILD: B-U-I-L-D -> then positions: B(1), U(2), I(3) -> matches, L(4)? but we need fourth=N -> L is fourth, not N -> no; also the fourth would be L -> but we require N in the fourth -> invalid.\n        ""CHINK"": C? absent -> invalid.\n        ""FLING"": F-L-I-N-G -> F(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), G(5) -> valid? G not absent? yes? But wait we haven\'t mentioned F, L, G.\n        ""MINIM"" -> M-I-N-I-M: positions: M(1), I(2)? I(3)? ""MINIM"" -> M(1), I(2), N(3), I(4), M(5) -> doesn\'t match: we need third=I? This has second=I? and third=N? Then it would be I at second, N at third -> doesn\'t match.\n\n        Actually, let\'s break down ""FLING"": F-L-I-N-G -> \n          1st: F, 2nd: L, 3rd: I -> yes, 4th: N -> yes, 5th: G -> good? But note ""G"" is allowed.\n\n        So we have ""FLING"" as candidate.\n\n      Another: ""KUZIN"" -> not common.\n\n    Considering frequency and commonality:\n\n      ""BLINK"" is a common word -> valid.\n\n      Also ""BLIND"": common.\n\n      ""FLING"": common.\n\n      ""THYMI"" -> not valid? Not a word.\n\n    However, we must choose one.\n\n    Let me see which one gives more information:\n\n      We want to test letters that are likely? Also, we have only one occurrence of I? But we know the position. And we know N.\n\n      Our goal is to guess the entire word? But we have three positions unknown: first, second, and fifth.\n\n      If we guess ""BLINK"", then:\n\n        If the word is ""BLINK"", we win.\n        Otherwise, we get feedback: \n          Which of B, L, K are correct? And the positions? But note, the fifth position might be something else.\n\n      Similarly for ""BLIND"" or ""FLING"".\n\n    Another candidate: ""OWING"" -> O is absent? Avoid O -> invalid.\n\n    Let me think of more: \n\n      ""SWING"": S-W-I-N-G -> S(1), W(2), I(3), N(4), G(5) -> and O, T? No, we don\'t include O or T? So S,W,G are not absent -> valid? But wait: we have feedback that O and T are absent? So we are not using O or T -> correct? Yes.\n\n    However, we already have:\n\n        ""BLINK"": B,L,K\n        ""BLIND"": B,L,D\n        ""FLING"": F,L,G\n        ""SWING"": S,W,G\n\n    Also possible: ""BUYIN"" -> B-U-Y-I-N: B(1), U(2), Y(3) -> no: we need third letter I? This would be Y at third? Then I at fourth? -> invalid.\n\n    So words where the third letter is I and fourth is N: so the structure is __ I N _\n\n    Possible fifth letters: \n      We need one more letter at the end? For ""BLINK"", it\'s K; for ""BLIND"", D; ""FLING"", G; ""SWING"", G; ""WHINS"", S; ""QUINS"", S.\n\n    We haven\'t tested: B, F, L, W, S, Q, etc.\n\n    How to choose? We might prioritize letters we haven\'t tested that are common.\n\n    We have already eliminated: A, E, O (vowels) -> so we have I and U (if it exists) and Y? \n\n    We haven\'t tested U and Y? So choosing a word with U or Y might give us vowel information.\n\n    For example, ""BUILD"" doesn\'t fit? Because fourth letter is L, not N.\n\n    ""QUINS"": Q-U-I-N-S -> Q not absent? And U is at position 2? Then position: \n        Q(1), U(2), I(3), N(4), S(5) -> good? And U is a vowel we haven\'t tested.\n\n    Is ""QUINS"" a word? Yes, it\'s a variant of quint.\n\n    But Q is rare? And U: it\'s the only vowel possibility? \n\n    Alternatively, we can choose a word with common consonants? Like S?\n\n    We are also constrained by the fact that we must avoid the absent letters: C,R,A,E,P,O,T.\n\n    Given we are on the third guess? We have 6 guesses total? So far we are making the third guess.\n\n    Strategy: We want to maximize information? Or solve? Since we have three positions and many letters? A guess that covers more possibilities? \n\n    However, note: we have two positions open: first, second, fifth? Three letters? And we know third and fourth.\n\n    Maybe we can try a word that uses common letters? And covers several possibilities?\n\n    We list the most common letters we haven\'t tested? Remaining common consonants: S, L, D, M, B, G.\n\n    We had in the first guess: tested C,R,A,N,E -> absent except N.\n    Second guess: P,O,I,N,T -> absent except I,N.\n\n    So letters tested: C,R,A,E,N,P,O,T (8 letters). But we know N and I are present? But I we already fixed? And N fixed? So the unknown letters are from the remaining.\n\n    Total tested (and found absent): C,R,A,E,P,O,T -> 7 absent letters.\n\n    Presents: I and N? And we know I and N are fixed? So the secret word has I and N? And two other letters? No: the secret word has five letters: \n        We only know positions 3 and 4. So the rest three are unknown? But we don\'t know if there are duplicates? But so far? We haven\'t seen duplicates.\n\n    We can assume no duplicates? But sometimes words have duplicates? Let\'s be cautious? \n\n    Possibilities: the secret word has three letters: let\'s call them L1, L2, L5? They are distinct and not in the absent list? And not I or N? Because if they were I or N, they would appear again? \n\n    But wait: I and N are in positions 3 and 4? So they might appear only once? Or not? But we don\'t know? However, in our previous guesses? No duplicates? \n\n    We might assume that duplicate letters are not present because we have no feedback about duplicates? But that\'s not reliable.\n\n    So we have to guess arbitrarily.\n\n    Given the candidates:\n\n      ""BLINK"": uses B, L, K\n      ""BLIND"": uses B, L, D\n      ""FLING"": F, L, G\n      ""SWING"": S, W, G\n      ""QUINS"": Q, U, S\n\n    We want to get feedback that can help us? Because if we guess a word and get more ✓, we get closer? Or if we get x, we eliminate more.\n\n    Choosing ""QUINS"" uses rare letters? U and Q? And S? It might be inefficient? Because Q is rare? So if we get all x? Then we know only the fixed positions? \n\n    Better to use common letters? So ""BLINK"", ""BLIND"", ""FLING"", ""SWING""? \n\n    How common?\n\n      ""SWING"" has S, W, G? S is very common? W and G are medium? \n      ""FLING"" has F, L, G? F and L are common? \n      ""BLINK"" has B, L, K? L is common.\n      ""BLIND"" has B, L, D? L is common.\n\n    We haven\'t eliminated L? So ""L"" appears in many candidates? Therefore, testing L might be beneficial? \n\n    But note: if we guess a word with L, and if L is in the word? We get feedback? Otherwise we eliminate L.\n\n    However, we have to guess the entire word? We might guess ""FLING"" or ""BLINK""? \n\n    Let me see frequency in the English language: E, T, A, O, I, N are already handled? But E,A,O,T absent? Then next: S, H, R (but R absent)? R is gone? So we have S common? \n\n    Therefore, including S might be good? So ""SWING""?\n\n    But note: we haven\'t tested S? So we could guess ""SWING"": which uses S, W, I, N, G.\n\n    However, the pattern: ? ? I N ? -> so ""SWING"": S at first? W at second? G at fifth? \n\n    Now? Do we have to use L? Not necessarily? \n\n    Consider: there might be words without L? \n\n    We don\'t know? \n\n    We can choose ""SWING"" to test S? Then if S is in the word? We get ✓ at position 1? etc.\n\n    Alternative: we note that there aren\'t many words matching the pattern? So we might want to guess one of the common words? \n\n    A better approach: we can pick a word that uses letters that cover the possible words? \n\n    Since we don\'t know, we pick a common word? Let\'s pick ""BLINK"" or ""SWING""? \n\n    I\'ll go with ""BLINK"" because it has L? But L is also in other candidate words? \n\n    However, we haven\'t tested B, L, K? So we guess ""BLINK"" and see.\n\n    If the word is ""BLINK"", we win? If not, we get feedback:\n\n        First letter: if B is correct? Or in the word? But the first position might be another letter.\n        Second letter: L? if present? etc.\n\n    But note: we know position 3=I? Position 4=N? So positions 1 and 2 are what we test? And position 5=K? \n\n    So let\'s guess ""BLINK"".\n\n<guess>blink</guess>### Analysis of Feedback:\nFrom previous guesses:  \n1. **crane**:  \n   - C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x) → **N** is in position 4, and **C, R, A, E** are absent.  \n2. **point**:  \n   - P(x), O(x), I(✓), N(✓), T(x) → **I** is in position 3, **N** is in position 4, and **P, O, T** are absent.  \n\n### Key Constraints:\n- **Fixed positions**:  \n  - Position 3: **I**  \n  - Position 4: **N**  \n- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, E, P, O, T  \n- **Unknown positions**: 1, 2, and 5.  \n\n### Strategy:\n- The secret word follows the pattern: `[?][?] I N [?]`  \n- Choose a word that:  \n  - Fits `[?][?] I N [?]`  \n  - Uses only letters **not** in the absent set (C, R, A, E, P, O, T).  \n  - Prioritizes common letters and maximizes new information (e.g., testing frequent untested letters like S, L, B).  \n- Possible candidates:  \n  - **BLINK** (tests B, L, K; valid English word with ""I"" at position 3 and ""N"" at position 4).  \n  - **BLIND** (tests B, L, D).  \n  - **SWING** (tests S, W, G).  \n  - **FLING** (tests F, L, G).  \n- **Why BLINK?**  \n  - **B**, **L**, **K** are common untested letters.  \n  - ""L"" appears in multiple candidates (e.g., BLIND, FLING), so testing it could resolve ambiguity.  \n  - ""BLINK"" is a high-frequency word that fits the pattern.  \n\n### Next Guess:\nGuess **BLINK** to test key new letters (B, L, K) in positions 1, 2, and 5.\n\n<guess>blink</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(✓) N(✓) T(x)\nGuess 3: blink -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(✓) I(✓) N(✓) K(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

1. ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)
   → N is in the word and in the correct position (4th)
   → C, R, A, E are not in the word

2. ""point"": P(x), O(x), I(✓), N(✓), T(x)
   → I is in the word and in the correct position (3rd), N is correct (4th)
   → P, O, T are not in the word

3. ""blink"": B(x), L(✓), I(✓), N(✓), K(x)
   → L is in the word and in the correct position (2nd), I and N are correct (3rd and 4th)
   → B and K are not in the word

Now we know:
- The secret word has fixed letters: 
    position 2: L (from ""blink"") → So second letter is L
    position 3: I (from ""point"" and confirmed in ""blink"")
    position 4: N (from ""crane"" and confirmed)
- Thus, the pattern is: _ L I N _
- Absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, O, T, B, K (all marked x)

So the word is: ? L I N ?

We need to fill the first and fifth positions.

Constraints:
- The letters must not be any of the absent letters: C,R,A,E,P,O,T,B,K
- They must be English letters that form a valid 5-letter word.

Possible letters for first and fifth positions: 
   Remaining letters: D, F, G, H, J, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: We have to choose letters that form a valid word of the form: X L I N Y (where X and Y are letters from the allowed set).

Now, let's think of common English words matching this pattern:

- ""ALIGN"" → But A is absent → invalid
- ""FLING"" → F is allowed? F not in absent set? 
   F not in {C,R,A,E,P,O,T,B,K}? 
   Pattern: F(1) L(2) I(3) N(4)? Then fifth? We have ""FLING"": F L I N G → fifth is G?
   So ""FLING"": letters F and G? 
   Check absent: F and G not absent → valid. So candidate.

- ""BLIND"" → B is absent (from third guess: B(x)) → invalid
- ""CLING"" → C absent → invalid
- ""ELFIN"" → E absent → invalid
- ""GLINT"" → G and T? But T is absent → invalid (from ""point"": T(x))
- ""SLING"" → S(1) L(2) I(3) N(4) G(5) → valid? S and G not absent? Yes.
- ""SWING"" → S(1) W(2)? But second letter must be L? → invalid because we have L fixed at second? 
   However, ""swing"" is S-W-I-N-G → second is W, but we know second is L? So not matching? 
   So only words that have L as second letter are considered? So ""swing"" does not fix? Because it has W at second? → invalid for this pattern.

But note: our pattern is fixed: ? L I N ?

Therefore, ""swing"" does not fit? Because its second letter is W? So we must have L at second? So ""swing"" becomes S-W-I-N-G → W in second? But we require second to be L? So no match? → not candidate.

Similarly, ""thing"" → T absent and also not L at second? → invalid.

So other possibilities:

- ""FLINT"" → T absent → invalid
- ""OLINT"" → O absent → invalid

Another: ""MINIS"" → but M-I-N? Then we have I at third? But second letter? MINIS: M(1), I(2) → but second is I, not L? → invalid.

Focus: the word must have the second letter L? So ... but ""align"" has A as second? No, align: A-L-I-G-N? 
  Positions: A(1), L(2), I(3), G(4)? No! We need N at fourth? So ""align"" has G at fourth? Not N? → invalid.

""FLINT"" has T at fifth? And T absent? But also FLINT: F-L-I-N-T → but T absent? → invalid.

So let's list words:

  ""FLING"": F-L-I-N-G → F(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), G(5) → valid? Letters: F,G not absent → good.

  ""SLING"": S-L-I-N-G → S(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), G(5) → letters S,G not absent → good.

  ""STING"" → T absent? → invalid.

  ""LYING"" → Y at third? But we have to have I at third? So L(1), Y(2)? Wait: pattern is _ L I N _? So ""LYING"": L(1), Y(2), I(3) -- wait, that fits? Then N(4)? But ""LYING"" doesn't have N? It has L-Y-I-N-G: L(1), Y(2), I(3), N(4), G(5) → yes! 

But wait: ""LYING"": L-Y-I-N-G → matches the pattern: 
   first: Y? No: 
      Position 1: L? That would be L, then position 2: Y? But we require position 2 to be L? → contradiction? 
   Because: we need position 2 to be L? So:
      Position 1: first letter?
      Position 2: L
      Position 3: I
      Position 4: N
      Position 5: fifth?

So in ""LYING"": 
   L is at position 1 (first letter) → and then Y is at position 2? But we require the second letter to be L? So in ""LYING"", position 2 is Y? So it doesn't have L at position 2 → it has L at position 1? Therefore, it does not match? 

But we know the word must have L at position 2? So our pattern: [unknown first] L I N [unknown fifth].

Therefore, words must look like: X L I N Y.

So ""FLING"": 
   F at first: position1
   L at position2 (fixed) → yes
   I at position3 → yes
   N at position4 → yes
   G at fifth → yes

Similarly, ""SLING"": S L I N G → fits.

Also, ""ULNA"" is only four letters? Not five.

Another word: ""CLINK"" → C absent → invalid.

""BLINS"" → B? But B absent → invalid.

Now, what about ""FLIGHT""? Too long? Only five letters.

Another possibility: ""DAVEN"" → D-A-V-E-N → includes A and E? Absent → invalid.

So we have at least two candidates:
  ""FLING"" and ""SLING""

Also, are there more? 

  ""GLINT"": G-L-I-N-T? But T is absent → invalid.
  ""ELAND"": E? absent → invalid.
  ""QUEEN"": Q? and E? → invalid.

Another: ""OLIVE"" → O absent? and doesn't match pattern? Second letter must be L? Does ""OLIVE"" have L at second? O-L-I-V-E → yes? But O is absent? → invalid.

Therefore: FLING and SLING are strong candidates.

But note: we haven't tested F, S, G? But we can choose one? 

We need to pick one to guess? 

We are on the fourth guess? Total guesses are 6? So we can try one? 

But note: if we guess one? And it's incorrect? We eliminate? 

But then we guess the other? We might win with two guesses? But we have three guesses left? 

Alternatively, consider words that use new letters? 

But we don't have much constraints? 

We can also consider: the word could have duplicate letters? But so far: all letters we know (L,I,N) are distinct? So probably the first and fifth are distinct? 

But we don't know? 

Both candidates have the fifth letter G? So if we guess and it becomes ✓? Then we know? 

But actually: 
   ""FLING"" has F at first and G at fifth.
   ""SLING"" has S at first and G at fifth.

So the difference is first letter: F vs S? 

We haven't eliminated F or S? 

So we choose one? 

We want to maximize information? 

Alternatively, we can pick a word that uses a letter not G? For example, if we want to test more letters? But both candidates have G? 

But note: we are forced to use the pattern? So we have to choose a word that matches ? L I N ?

If we choose a word that doesn't have G? Then we test another letter? 

Let me search for words that match ? L I N ?

Other than FLING and SLING? 

Possible:
   ""MLINE"" → M? and E? E is absent → invalid.
   ""ULNAR"" → U-L-N-A-R? But second letter? U-L: L is second? Then position 3: N? But we need I? So U-L-N? Not I → invalid.
   ""ALIGN"" has A (absent).
   ""ELINT"" has E (absent).
   ""FLINT"" has T (absent).
   ""SLINK"" → S-L-I-N-K? But K is absent (from ""blink"": K(x)) → invalid.
   ""SLIMY"" → S-L-I-M-Y? Positions: S(1), L(2), I(3), M(4) → but we need N at fourth → invalid.

Another possibility: ""QUALM"" → but no I? → no.

So really? Only FLING and SLING? 

Wait: but ""SLING"" and ""FLING"" are both valid? 

Now, we can choose one? And then if it fails? We adjust? 

We have two letters to test: at first: F or S? And fifth: G? 

If we guess ""SLING"":

  If correct: win.
  If not: then the word must be ""FLING""?

Because there are no other candidates? Or are there?

What about ""GLIST""? G-L-I-S-T? But T absent → invalid.

""SLICE"" → E? absent → invalid.

So really only two? 

Therefore, we can pick one? 

But we must choose an English word? 

So let me choose ""SLING"" because S is more common? 

But F and S both common? 

Alternatively? We might pick ""FLING""? 

But I'll choose ""SLING"" because I feel like it? 

But then the fifth letter is G? So if we get:

    S(?) L(✓) I(✓) N(✓) G(?)

How about G? It could be ""x"" if not? But in ""FLING"", G is at fifth? So if G is correct? Then only the first matters? 

But note: if we guess ""SLING"" and the word is ""FLING"", then:

   S(x) ? because S is not in the word? So S will get x? and L(✓), I(✓), N(✓), G(✓)? because G is at fifth? But then we get S(x) and G(✓)? 

Therefore, we can deduce the first letter? 

But we don't know the first letter? 

Therefore, we guess ""SLING"": 

   If feedback: 
      S -> ? (it could be ✓ or x or -? But in this case? For ""FLING"": S is not present? So x)
      L -> ✓
      I -> ✓
      N -> ✓
      G -> ✓

   So if the fifth letter is G? Then we get ✓ for G? 

   Then if S is x? Then the word must be ""FLING""? 

   Alternatively, if the fifth letter is something else? Then both words? But we don't have? 

   But wait: we don't have other words? 

Therefore, if we guess ""SLING"" and get:

   - First letter feedback:
          ✓: then win? because S at first? So SLING?
          x: then FLING?

   And fifth: G? ✓? because in both candidates? 

But wait: both ""FLING"" and ""SLING"" have G at fifth? So we expect G to be ✓? 

Therefore, we can guess ""SLING""? And then if S is ✓? win? If S is x? then FLING? 

But we have a problem? What if the fifth letter isn't G? Then we have missed? 

But we thought there were only FLING and SLING? So fifth letter must be G? 

Because we assumed? 

But what else? 

Let me double-check? 

We have pattern: ? L I N ? 

Possible words? We found:
  FLING, SLING

Are there others?

Let's expand:

  Words: 
    - F L I N G 
    - S L I N G 

But what about? 

  ""GUILD"" → G-U-I-L-D → second letter U? not L? no.

  ""BRINS"" → B absent? R absent → invalid.

  ""AHIND"" → A absent? and E? absent → invalid.

  ""YELLN"" → Y-E-L-L-N → E absent and not five letters? 

Wait: we must have five letters? 

Another: perhaps ""WELSH"" → W-E-L-S-H → E absent → invalid.

Or ""ZYLON"" → Z-Y-L-O-N → O absent → invalid.

I think we are safe: only FLING and SLING? 

So we choose ""SLING"" as a guess? 

Then we get: 
   S for the first letter? if it is ✓? then SLING? 
   else? then FLING? 

So we guess ""SLING""

But note: the fifth letter? In both cases? In FLING? G at fifth? so in ""SLING"" guess? G at fifth? So we get ✓ for G? 

Therefore, if S is ✓? we win? 
If S is x? then we know the word has F at first? and then fifth letter G? so we guess FLING next? 

We have three guesses left? Enough.

So let's guess ""SLING""

However, if the word is not either? then we have a problem? But we think it's unlikely? 

But in standard Wordle? We should choose valid words? 

Therefore:

<guess>sling</guess> 

But note: we are guessing a word? So we output SLING? 

But let me confirm: 

   ""SLING"" matches the pattern: S (first), L(second) -> must be L? and then I? N? and then G? 

   And avoids all absent letters? Yes: S, L, I, N, G? and L, I, N are known? So we test S and G? 

Yes.
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:

- **C, R, A, E, P, O, T, B, K** are **absent**.
- **Position 2 is L**, **position 3 is I**, and **position 4 is N**.
- The secret word pattern is: **`[?] L I N [?]`**.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Fixed Positions**:  
   - The second letter must be **L** (from Guess 3: `blink` → L(✓)).  
   - The third letter must be **I** (from Guess 2: `point` → I(✓)).  
   - The fourth letter must be **N** (from Guess 1: `crane` → N(✓)).  

2. **Absent Letters**:  
   - Eliminated letters: **C, R, A, E, P, O, T, B, K**.  
   - Valid letters for positions 1 and 5 are **D, F, G, H, J, M, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.  

3. **Possible Words**:  
   - Words must match the pattern `[?] L I N [?]`.  
   - Common valid English candidates:  
     - **`FLING`** (F at position 1, G at position 5) → Tests **F** and **G**.  
     - **`SLING`** (S at position 1, G at position 5) → Tests **S** and **G**.  
   - Both are high-frequency words fitting the pattern.  

4. **Selection Strategy**:  
   - Prioritize coverage of new letters. **S** is a highly common untested letter (more frequent than F).  
   - Guessing **`SLING`** maximizes information:
     - If **S** is correct (✓), the word is **`SLING`**.  
     - If **S** is absent (x), the word is likely **`FLING`**.  
   - **G** is shared in both candidates, so its feedback (likely ✓) is less diagnostic.  

5. **Final Choice**:  
   - **`SLING`** narrows down the solution efficiently with minimal risk, leveraging common letters.  

### Next Guess:
- Guessing **`SLING`** tests **S** at position 1 and **G** at position 5, while confirming fixed positions (L, I, N).  

<guess>sling</guess>",sling,"We have feedback from three guesses:

1. ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)
   → N is in the word and in the correct position (4th)
   → C, R, A, E are not in the word

2. ""point"": P(x), O(x), I(✓), N(✓), T(x)
   → I is in the word and in the correct position (3rd), N is correct (4th)
   → P, O, T are not in the word

3. ""blink"": B(x), L(✓), I(✓), N(✓), K(x)
   → L is in the word and in the correct position (2nd), I and N are correct (3rd and 4th)
   → B and K are not in the word

Now we know:
- The secret word has fixed letters: 
    position 2: L (from ""blink"") → So second letter is L
    position 3: I (from ""point"" and confirmed in ""blink"")
    position 4: N (from ""crane"" and confirmed)
- Thus, the pattern is: _ L I N _
- Absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, O, T, B, K (all marked x)

So the word is: ? L I N ?

We need to fill the first and fifth positions.

Constraints:
- The letters must not be any of the absent letters: C,R,A,E,P,O,T,B,K
- They must be English letters that form a valid 5-letter word.

Possible letters for first and fifth positions: 
   Remaining letters: D, F, G, H, J, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: We have to choose letters that form a valid word of the form: X L I N Y (where X and Y are letters from the allowed set).

Now, let's think of common English words matching this pattern:

- ""ALIGN"" → But A is absent → invalid
- ""FLING"" → F is allowed? F not in absent set? 
   F not in {C,R,A,E,P,O,T,B,K}? 
   Pattern: F(1) L(2) I(3) N(4)? Then fifth? We have ""FLING"": F L I N G → fifth is G?
   So ""FLING"": letters F and G? 
   Check absent: F and G not absent → valid. So candidate.

- ""BLIND"" → B is absent (from third guess: B(x)) → invalid
- ""CLING"" → C absent → invalid
- ""ELFIN"" → E absent → invalid
- ""GLINT"" → G and T? But T is absent → invalid (from ""point"": T(x))
- ""SLING"" → S(1) L(2) I(3) N(4) G(5) → valid? S and G not absent? Yes.
- ""SWING"" → S(1) W(2)? But second letter must be L? → invalid because we have L fixed at second? 
   However, ""swing"" is S-W-I-N-G → second is W, but we know second is L? So not matching? 
   So only words that have L as second letter are considered? So ""swing"" does not fix? Because it has W at second? → invalid for this pattern.

But note: our pattern is fixed: ? L I N ?

Therefore, ""swing"" does not fit? Because its second letter is W? So we must have L at second? So ""swing"" becomes S-W-I-N-G → W in second? But we require second to be L? So no match? → not candidate.

Similarly, ""thing"" → T absent and also not L at second? → invalid.

So other possibilities:

- ""FLINT"" → T absent → invalid
- ""OLINT"" → O absent → invalid

Another: ""MINIS"" → but M-I-N? Then we have I at third? But second letter? MINIS: M(1), I(2) → but second is I, not L? → invalid.

Focus: the word must have the second letter L? So ... but ""align"" has A as second? No, align: A-L-I-G-N? 
  Positions: A(1), L(2), I(3), G(4)? No! We need N at fourth? So ""align"" has G at fourth? Not N? → invalid.

""FLINT"" has T at fifth? And T absent? But also FLINT: F-L-I-N-T → but T absent? → invalid.

So let's list words:

  ""FLING"": F-L-I-N-G → F(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), G(5) → valid? Letters: F,G not absent → good.

  ""SLING"": S-L-I-N-G → S(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), G(5) → letters S,G not absent → good.

  ""STING"" → T absent? → invalid.

  ""LYING"" → Y at third? But we have to have I at third? So L(1), Y(2)? Wait: pattern is _ L I N _? So ""LYING"": L(1), Y(2), I(3) -- wait, that fits? Then N(4)? But ""LYING"" doesn't have N? It has L-Y-I-N-G: L(1), Y(2), I(3), N(4), G(5) → yes! 

But wait: ""LYING"": L-Y-I-N-G → matches the pattern: 
   first: Y? No: 
      Position 1: L? That would be L, then position 2: Y? But we require position 2 to be L? → contradiction? 
   Because: we need position 2 to be L? So:
      Position 1: first letter?
      Position 2: L
      Position 3: I
      Position 4: N
      Position 5: fifth?

So in ""LYING"": 
   L is at position 1 (first letter) → and then Y is at position 2? But we require the second letter to be L? So in ""LYING"", position 2 is Y? So it doesn't have L at position 2 → it has L at position 1? Therefore, it does not match? 

But we know the word must have L at position 2? So our pattern: [unknown first] L I N [unknown fifth].

Therefore, words must look like: X L I N Y.

So ""FLING"": 
   F at first: position1
   L at position2 (fixed) → yes
   I at position3 → yes
   N at position4 → yes
   G at fifth → yes

Similarly, ""SLING"": S L I N G → fits.

Also, ""ULNA"" is only four letters? Not five.

Another word: ""CLINK"" → C absent → invalid.

""BLINS"" → B? But B absent → invalid.

Now, what about ""FLIGHT""? Too long? Only five letters.

Another possibility: ""DAVEN"" → D-A-V-E-N → includes A and E? Absent → invalid.

So we have at least two candidates:
  ""FLING"" and ""SLING""

Also, are there more? 

  ""GLINT"": G-L-I-N-T? But T is absent → invalid.
  ""ELAND"": E? absent → invalid.
  ""QUEEN"": Q? and E? → invalid.

Another: ""OLIVE"" → O absent? and doesn't match pattern? Second letter must be L? Does ""OLIVE"" have L at second? O-L-I-V-E → yes? But O is absent? → invalid.

Therefore: FLING and SLING are strong candidates.

But note: we haven't tested F, S, G? But we can choose one? 

We need to pick one to guess? 

We are on the fourth guess? Total guesses are 6? So we can try one? 

But note: if we guess one? And it's incorrect? We eliminate? 

But then we guess the other? We might win with two guesses? But we have three guesses left? 

Alternatively, consider words that use new letters? 

But we don't have much constraints? 

We can also consider: the word could have duplicate letters? But so far: all letters we know (L,I,N) are distinct? So probably the first and fifth are distinct? 

But we don't know? 

Both candidates have the fifth letter G? So if we guess and it becomes ✓? Then we know? 

But actually: 
   ""FLING"" has F at first and G at fifth.
   ""SLING"" has S at first and G at fifth.

So the difference is first letter: F vs S? 

We haven't eliminated F or S? 

So we choose one? 

We want to maximize information? 

Alternatively, we can pick a word that uses a letter not G? For example, if we want to test more letters? But both candidates have G? 

But note: we are forced to use the pattern? So we have to choose a word that matches ? L I N ?

If we choose a word that doesn't have G? Then we test another letter? 

Let me search for words that match ? L I N ?

Other than FLING and SLING? 

Possible:
   ""MLINE"" → M? and E? E is absent → invalid.
   ""ULNAR"" → U-L-N-A-R? But second letter? U-L: L is second? Then position 3: N? But we need I? So U-L-N? Not I → invalid.
   ""ALIGN"" has A (absent).
   ""ELINT"" has E (absent).
   ""FLINT"" has T (absent).
   ""SLINK"" → S-L-I-N-K? But K is absent (from ""blink"": K(x)) → invalid.
   ""SLIMY"" → S-L-I-M-Y? Positions: S(1), L(2), I(3), M(4) → but we need N at fourth → invalid.

Another possibility: ""QUALM"" → but no I? → no.

So really? Only FLING and SLING? 

Wait: but ""SLING"" and ""FLING"" are both valid? 

Now, we can choose one? And then if it fails? We adjust? 

We have two letters to test: at first: F or S? And fifth: G? 

If we guess ""SLING"":

  If correct: win.
  If not: then the word must be ""FLING""?

Because there are no other candidates? Or are there?

What about ""GLIST""? G-L-I-S-T? But T absent → invalid.

""SLICE"" → E? absent → invalid.

So really only two? 

Therefore, we can pick one? 

But we must choose an English word? 

So let me choose ""SLING"" because S is more common? 

But F and S both common? 

Alternatively? We might pick ""FLING""? 

But I'll choose ""SLING"" because I feel like it? 

But then the fifth letter is G? So if we get:

    S(?) L(✓) I(✓) N(✓) G(?)

How about G? It could be ""x"" if not? But in ""FLING"", G is at fifth? So if G is correct? Then only the first matters? 

But note: if we guess ""SLING"" and the word is ""FLING"", then:

   S(x) ? because S is not in the word? So S will get x? and L(✓), I(✓), N(✓), G(✓)? because G is at fifth? But then we get S(x) and G(✓)? 

Therefore, we can deduce the first letter? 

But we don't know the first letter? 

Therefore, we guess ""SLING"": 

   If feedback: 
      S -> ? (it could be ✓ or x or -? But in this case? For ""FLING"": S is not present? So x)
      L -> ✓
      I -> ✓
      N -> ✓
      G -> ✓

   So if the fifth letter is G? Then we get ✓ for G? 

   Then if S is x? Then the word must be ""FLING""? 

   Alternatively, if the fifth letter is something else? Then both words? But we don't have? 

   But wait: we don't have other words? 

Therefore, if we guess ""SLING"" and get:

   - First letter feedback:
          ✓: then win? because S at first? So SLING?
          x: then FLING?

   And fifth: G? ✓? because in both candidates? 

But wait: both ""FLING"" and ""SLING"" have G at fifth? So we expect G to be ✓? 

Therefore, we can guess ""SLING""? And then if S is ✓? win? If S is x? then FLING? 

But we have a problem? What if the fifth letter isn't G? Then we have missed? 

But we thought there were only FLING and SLING? So fifth letter must be G? 

Because we assumed? 

But what else? 

Let me double-check? 

We have pattern: ? L I N ? 

Possible words? We found:
  FLING, SLING

Are there others?

Let's expand:

  Words: 
    - F L I N G 
    - S L I N G 

But what about? 

  ""GUILD"" → G-U-I-L-D → second letter U? not L? no.

  ""BRINS"" → B absent? R absent → invalid.

  ""AHIND"" → A absent? and E? absent → invalid.

  ""YELLN"" → Y-E-L-L-N → E absent and not five letters? 

Wait: we must have five letters? 

Another: perhaps ""WELSH"" → W-E-L-S-H → E absent → invalid.

Or ""ZYLON"" → Z-Y-L-O-N → O absent → invalid.

I think we are safe: only FLING and SLING? 

So we choose ""SLING"" as a guess? 

Then we get: 
   S for the first letter? if it is ✓? then SLING? 
   else? then FLING? 

So we guess ""SLING""

But note: the fifth letter? In both cases? In FLING? G at fifth? so in ""SLING"" guess? G at fifth? So we get ✓ for G? 

Therefore, if S is ✓? we win? 
If S is x? then we know the word has F at first? and then fifth letter G? so we guess FLING next? 

We have three guesses left? Enough.

So let's guess ""SLING""

However, if the word is not either? then we have a problem? But we think it's unlikely? 

But in standard Wordle? We should choose valid words? 

Therefore:

<guess>sling</guess> 

But note: we are guessing a word? So we output SLING? 

But let me confirm: 

   ""SLING"" matches the pattern: S (first), L(second) -> must be L? and then I? N? and then G? 

   And avoids all absent letters? Yes: S, L, I, N, G? and L, I, N are known? So we test S and G? 

Yes.Based on the previous feedback:

- **C, R, A, E, P, O, T, B, K** are **absent**.
- **Position 2 is L**, **position 3 is I**, and **position 4 is N**.
- The secret word pattern is: **`[?] L I N [?]`**.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Fixed Positions**:  
   - The second letter must be **L** (from Guess 3: `blink` → L(✓)).  
   - The third letter must be **I** (from Guess 2: `point` → I(✓)).  
   - The fourth letter must be **N** (from Guess 1: `crane` → N(✓)).  

2. **Absent Letters**:  
   - Eliminated letters: **C, R, A, E, P, O, T, B, K**.  
   - Valid letters for positions 1 and 5 are **D, F, G, H, J, M, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.  

3. **Possible Words**:  
   - Words must match the pattern `[?] L I N [?]`.  
   - Common valid English candidates:  
     - **`FLING`** (F at position 1, G at position 5) → Tests **F** and **G**.  
     - **`SLING`** (S at position 1, G at position 5) → Tests **S** and **G**.  
   - Both are high-frequency words fitting the pattern.  

4. **Selection Strategy**:  
   - Prioritize coverage of new letters. **S** is a highly common untested letter (more frequent than F).  
   - Guessing **`SLING`** maximizes information:
     - If **S** is correct (✓), the word is **`SLING`**.  
     - If **S** is absent (x), the word is likely **`FLING`**.  
   - **G** is shared in both candidates, so its feedback (likely ✓) is less diagnostic.  

5. **Final Choice**:  
   - **`SLING`** narrows down the solution efficiently with minimal risk, leveraging common letters.  

### Next Guess:
- Guessing **`SLING`** tests **S** at position 1 and **G** at position 5, while confirming fixed positions (L, I, N).",Guess 4: sling -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(✓) I(✓) N(✓) G(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,5,FLING,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess:
 Guess: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)

 This means:
  C is not in the secret word -> x
  R is not in the secret word -> x
  A is not in the secret word -> x
  N is in the word and in the correct position -> ✓ (fourth letter)
  E is not in the secret word -> x

 So, we know:
  1. The fourth letter of the secret word is N.
  2. The letters C, R, A, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, we must avoid using C, R, A, E in our next guess.

 Also, since N is in the fourth position, our next guess must have N in the fourth position.

 Now, we need to choose a word that:
  - Has N as the fourth letter.
  - Contains only letters that are not C, R, A, E (and possibly other excluded letters, but so far only these).
  - Uses other common letters to maximize information.

 Since we have eliminated some vowels (A, E), we have left: vowels -> I, O, U (and sometimes Y).
 Consonants: many left, such as B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We also know that the word does not contain R, so we avoid that.

 Let's think of words that have N in the fourth position.

 Common pattern: _ _ _ N _

 We have to fill in the first, second, third, and fifth positions.

 We should avoid letters that are known to be absent: C, R, A, E.

 Possible words? Let's brainstorm:

  - Using common letters: S, T, L, O, P, etc.

 Examples:
  ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> This has no C,R,A,E and N at the fourth position? 
    Breakdown: 
      Position: 1: P, 2: O, 3: I, 4: N, 5: T
    But wait, our feedback only said N is in the fourth position, but the word ""point"" has N at the fourth? Actually, yes: 
      P (1st), O (2nd), I (3rd), N (4th), T (5th). So that fits.

  Other possibilities:
    ""JOINT"": J, O, I, N, T -> also okay, but J is less common.
    ""MOUNT"": M, O, U, N, T -> avoids the bad letters? M,O,U,N,T: no C,R,A,E -> okay.
    ""COUNT"": But C is excluded -> not allowed, because C is absent in the secret word.

 We must avoid C, so ""count"" is out.

 Other words: ""BLUNT"", ""FLINT"", ""GRANT"" (but G,R,A: R and A are excluded) -> so ""GRANT"" is invalid because of R and A.

 After eliminating, let's consider:

  ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> good.
  ""MOUNT"": M, O, U, N, T -> good.
  ""TOWNS"": T, O, W, N, S -> avoids bad letters? T,O,W,N,S: no C,R,A,E -> good.

 But note: the feedback for ""crane"" showed that N is in the correct position (fourth). So we must have N in the fourth.

 Now, we want to test for other common letters. Since we have eliminated A and E, we can test O and U (vowels) and common consonants like T, S, L, P, etc.

 Considering ""POINT"": 
   It lets us check P, O, I, T (in addition to the known N).

 ""MOUNT"": checks M, O, U, T.

 We might also consider ""MINTS"", but note the feedback only said N is in the fourth letter, and we don't know about duplicates. But the word ""minst"" isn't common? Actually, ""MINTS"": M-I-N-T-S. This has S at the end and T. But note: we are guessing and the word must be valid.

 However, we have to be cautious: we don't know if the word has repeated letters? But since we haven't encountered duplicates yet, we assume a word without duplication for now? Actually, the rules don't prohibit duplicates, but in this case we are guessing a new word without using the letters we know are absent.

 But note: we are limited by the fact that C, R, A, E cannot be in the word. Also, we must have N in the fourth position.

 Let's choose a word that uses letters we haven't tested so that we get more coverage.

 Previously in ""crane"", we tested C,R,A,N,E. Now we avoid those. So we want to use:

   Possible letters: 
     Vowels: I, O, U (and Y)
     Consonants: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,S,T,V,W,X,Y,Z

 However, we don't know about all letters. We tested: C,R,A,E -> absent.

 Now, if we choose ""POINT"", we are testing P, O, I, T (and N we know is in the fourth).

 If we choose ""MOUNT"", we test M, O, U, T.

 Another option: ""SHUNT"" (S,H,U,N,T) -> H and U are new.

 We need to get as many new letters as possible.

 Let's look for words that have many common letters we haven't tried.

 Considering common consonants: S, T, L are very common. We haven't tried S, T, L? 

 In ""crane"", we did T? No: C,R,A,N,E didn't include T.

 So we can try to include S and T and L.

 Example: ""POINT"" has T at the end? Yes.

 Or ""SPOIL"": but fourth letter must be N -> not N? No, wait: S-P-O-I-L -> fourth is I? So not N? Therefore, we must have fourth letter N.

 Another word: ""LUNTS"" -> L-U-N-T-S -> fourth letter is N? Let's see: 
   L (1), U (2), N (3), T (4), S (5) -> that would have N at the third, not fourth? 
   We need: _ _ _ N _ -> so the fourth is N, meaning positions: 
     1st: ?, 2nd: ?, 3rd: ?, 4th: N, 5th: ?

 So we need the fourth letter to be the fourth character: the third character can be any letter.

 Therefore, ""LUNTS"" would be: L-U-N-T? Then it would be L (1), U (2), N (3) -> but we need N at the fourth? So that doesn't fit.

 Actually, the word ""lunts"" is L-U-N-T: but that's five letters? 
   - Actually, it would be: position 1: L, 2: U, 3: N, 4: T, 5: S? 
   Then N is at the third? So not fourth.

 How about ""JOINS""? J-O-I-N-S: 
   Position: J (1), O (2), I (3), N (4), S (5) -> perfect.

 But J is less common, so maybe not the best.

 How about ""COINS""? But C is excluded -> invalid.

 How about ""POINT"": P-O-I-N-T -> P(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> this works.

 How about ""JOINT""? Same as above but J. 

 Another word: ""TAWNY"": T-A-W-N-Y -> but A is excluded -> invalid.

 ""DOWNY"": D-O-W-N-Y -> D(1), O(2), W(3), N(4), Y(5). This avoids excluded letters? 
   D: not excluded? 
   O: okay.
   W: okay.
   N: okay (but already known at fourth).
   Y: okay.

 But wait, we have to avoid A and E? Yes. So ""DOWNY"" is acceptable? 
   However, we know A is excluded, so ""DOWNY"" doesn't have A or the others.

 So ""DOWNY"" is a candidate.

 However, we don't want to use too many rare letters? And we are trying to get information.

 Let me compare:

  Candidate words:

   ""POINT"": letters -> P, O, I, T (and N)
   ""JOINT"": J is rare -> avoid?
   ""DOWNY"": D, O, W, Y -> D and W and Y are not as common? But why not? They are valid.

   Another one: ""TOWN'S"" isn't valid? ""TOWNS"": T-O-W-N-S -> T(1), O(2), W(3), N(4), S(5) -> good.

   ""MINUS"": M-I-N-U-S -> M(1), I(2), N(3), U(4), S(5) -> N is at the third? Not fourth -> invalid.

 So we must have the fourth letter N.

 Another candidate: ""BORNS""? But B-O-R-N-S: R is excluded? We have R in ""crane"" and feedback said R is not in the word -> so cannot use R.

 Therefore, ""BORNS"" is invalid.

 How about ""SONGS""? S-O-N-G-S: the fourth letter is the fourth character: 
   S(1), O(2), N(3) -> wait, then G(4), S(5)? So N is at third? And G at fourth? Not correct.

 We must have the fourth letter being N: the word must be in the form ???N?.

 So ""SONGS"" doesn't have the fourth letter as N? Actually, 
   S -> first
   O -> second
   N -> third? 
   G -> fourth
   S -> fifth

 So we need the N in the fourth? So if we had ""SOGND"" that doesn't make sense.

 Another candidate: ""BUNKS"": B-U-N-K-S -> B(1), U(2), N(3) -> N is third? Then K(4), S(5) -> no.

 ""PUNKS"": same problem: P(1), U(2), N(3), K(4), S(5) -> N at third.

 How about ""PLANK"": P-L-A-N-K -> but A is excluded -> invalid.

 ""BLINK"": B-L-I-N-K -> B(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), K(5) -> good. However, we haven't eliminated B,L,I,K? No, because only C,R,A,E are gone. So valid.

 But note: we don't know if the word has I or not? So ""BLINK"" is a candidate.

 Now, comparing:

   POINT: uses P,O,I,T
   BLINK: uses B,L,I,N,K -> but we already know N? But we are testing B,L,I,K.
   TOWNS: uses T,O,W,N,S

 We want to maximize coverage of new letters.

 Previously used: C, R, A, N, E (but N is known, and the others absent except N).
 So we have used 5 letters: C,R,A,N,E.

 For the next guess, we can include N because we know it's in the word and we are using it in the correct position? But we are also testing other letters.

 Idea: choose a word that uses as many new letters as possible.

 Considering:

   POINT: P, O, I, T -> all new? and N (we know is present, so only feedback on new letters).

   BLINK: B, L, I, K -> and N -> all new? 

   TOWNS: T, O, W, N, S -> T, O, W, S new.

 But note: in BLINK, the letter I is at the third position? We are testing I? That's fine.

 However, we are only on the second guess, so we don't have many constraints.

 I think ""POINT"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters.

 Another candidate: ""SPOIL"" -> but we need fourth letter N? Not possible.

 Let's go with ""POINT"". It has the form: 
   Position 1: P, Position 2: O, Position 3: I, Position 4: N, Position 5: T.

 This fits the pattern.

 So we guess ""POINT"".

<guess>point</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- **C, R, A, E** are **NOT** in the secret word (marked ""x"").  
- **N** is **CORRECTLY** placed in the 4th position (marked ""✓"").  

### Strategy for Second Guess:
- The secret word has **N in the 4th position** and excludes **C, R, A, E**.  
- Choose a word that:  
  - Has **N as the 4th letter**.  
  - Uses common unused letters (e.g., **S, T, L, O, P**, since vowels **I, O, U** are untested).  
  - Avoids **C, R, A, E**.  
- Good candidates: POINT, TOWN, JOINT, BLINK, MOUNT.  
- Selected **""POINT""** because it:  
  - Maximizes new common letters (**P, O, I, T**).  
  - Fits the constraint (N in position 4: P-O-**I-N-T**).  
  - Is a common English word.  

Now guessing ""POINT"" to test new positions and letters.

<guess>point</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(✓) N(✓) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
Second guess: ""point"" -> Feedback: P(x) O(x) I(✓) N(✓) T(x)

From this, we know:

1. The secret word has the **fourth letter (position 4) as N**. 
2. The secret word has the **third letter (position 3) as I** (since in ""point"", I is at position 3, and it got a ✓).
3. Letters **C, R, A, E, P, O, T** are **not** in the word (based on both feedbacks).
   - Specifically, absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, O, T.

Therefore, we can summarize:

- Positions:
   - Position 3: I (correct)
   - Position 4: N (correct)
- Absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, O, T

Now, the secret word pattern is: ? ? I N ?

We need to fill in the first, second, and fifth positions with letters that are:
   - not C, R, A, E, P, O, T
   - and must be English letters.

Additionally, since we are constrained by the absent letters, we must choose from the remaining consonants and vowels. Note that vowels left: U, and sometimes Y. Consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note that Y can be used as a vowel or consonant.

Moreover, we must form a valid English word of the form: [letter1][letter2] I N [letter5]

Let's think of possible words:

The pattern: ? ? I N ?

We avoid the absent letters: so the first, second, and fifth positions must not contain C,R,A,E,P,O,T.

Consider common possibilities:

- For the first letter: possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, S, W, etc.
- For the second letter: similar, and consider common combinations.

Examples:

  ""SPI N"" -> but S? Wait, let's look: 
    The word could be: 
    S _ I N _ ? But the second letter cannot be O (absent) or T? Absent. 
    Possibilities: ""SPIN_"" -> but P is absent? So no: P is absent -> cannot use P.

  Instead, let's list words ending with ""IN"" (but note we need fifth letter).

  Common patterns: words like:
    ""BEGIN"": B-E-G-I-N? But position: E would be second? But E is absent -> invalid.
    ""CHAIN"": C present -> invalid, and A absent.
    ""BRING"": B-R-I-N-G -> R absent -> invalid.
    ""BLINK"": B-L-I-N-K -> L at second? But we have feedback that O and T are absent? Not in this. Now, letters: B, L, I, N, K -> I and N are set. Letters B, L, K are new. 
      Check absent: C,R,A,E,P,O,T -> B not absent? L not absent? K not absent? -> valid.
      Pattern: B(1) L(2) I(3) N(4) K(5) -> matches.

    ""S I N K"": S? But we need two letters before I? No: structure is ? ? I N ? -> so three letters: first, second, third=I, fourth=N, fifth=?
    ""S K I N"": would be first=S, second=K, third=I -> but then fourth? Not I? No.

    Actually, the word ""skin"" is S-K-I-N -> only four letters? No, we need five letters: positions are fixed: third is I, fourth is N? 
        Then what about ""SKINN"" (double N)? Not a word.

    So let's think of five-letter words having I in third and N in fourth.

    Other words:
      ""BAKIN"" -> not a word? Actually, ""baking"" is six letters.
      ""BEGIN"" doesn't work because E? 
      ""BLUIN"" -> not a word.
      ""QUINS"" -> Q-U-I-N-S: 
          Position: 1=Q, 2=U, 3=I (matches), 4=N (matches), 5=S -> but is ""quins"" a word? It is an uncommon word? We might avoid uncommon words.

    Another: ""WHINS"" -> W-H-I-N-S: 
        Position: W (1), H (2), I (3), N (4), S (5) -> good? Is it valid? ""whins"" is a word (a type of plant).

    But note: we have H and W, which we haven't tested? And no conflict.

    Other possibilities:
      ""BLIND"": B-L-I-N-D -> D at fifth? But letters: B, L, D -> as long as these are not absent? They are not. So valid.

    But wait, earlier feedback? We don't know about L? So it's okay.

    So we have two strong candidates:
      ""BLINK"": letters B, L, I, N, K -> positions: B(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), K(5)
      ""BLIND"": B(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), D(5)

    But how to choose? We need to test new letters? Also, note that we haven't tested: B, L, K, D, H, W, etc.

    We should also consider the frequency of letters? And if there are other constraints.

    After ""point"", we know that the solution pattern is: ? ? I N ?

    We must avoid the absent letters: C,R,A,E,P,O,T.

    Now, let's list all possible words? Not exhaustive, but we can think:

      Common words:
        ""BLINK""
        ""BLIND""
        ""BRING"" -> R absent -> invalid.
        ""BUILD"" -> U-I? But third letter I? BUILD: B-U-I-L-D -> then positions: B(1), U(2), I(3) -> matches, L(4)? but we need fourth=N -> L is fourth, not N -> no; also the fourth would be L -> but we require N in the fourth -> invalid.
        ""CHINK"": C? absent -> invalid.
        ""FLING"": F-L-I-N-G -> F(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), G(5) -> valid? G not absent? yes? But wait we haven't mentioned F, L, G.
        ""MINIM"" -> M-I-N-I-M: positions: M(1), I(2)? I(3)? ""MINIM"" -> M(1), I(2), N(3), I(4), M(5) -> doesn't match: we need third=I? This has second=I? and third=N? Then it would be I at second, N at third -> doesn't match.

        Actually, let's break down ""FLING"": F-L-I-N-G -> 
          1st: F, 2nd: L, 3rd: I -> yes, 4th: N -> yes, 5th: G -> good? But note ""G"" is allowed.

        So we have ""FLING"" as candidate.

      Another: ""KUZIN"" -> not common.

    Considering frequency and commonality:

      ""BLINK"" is a common word -> valid.

      Also ""BLIND"": common.

      ""FLING"": common.

      ""THYMI"" -> not valid? Not a word.

    However, we must choose one.

    Let me see which one gives more information:

      We want to test letters that are likely? Also, we have only one occurrence of I? But we know the position. And we know N.

      Our goal is to guess the entire word? But we have three positions unknown: first, second, and fifth.

      If we guess ""BLINK"", then:

        If the word is ""BLINK"", we win.
        Otherwise, we get feedback: 
          Which of B, L, K are correct? And the positions? But note, the fifth position might be something else.

      Similarly for ""BLIND"" or ""FLING"".

    Another candidate: ""OWING"" -> O is absent? Avoid O -> invalid.

    Let me think of more: 

      ""SWING"": S-W-I-N-G -> S(1), W(2), I(3), N(4), G(5) -> and O, T? No, we don't include O or T? So S,W,G are not absent -> valid? But wait: we have feedback that O and T are absent? So we are not using O or T -> correct? Yes.

    However, we already have:

        ""BLINK"": B,L,K
        ""BLIND"": B,L,D
        ""FLING"": F,L,G
        ""SWING"": S,W,G

    Also possible: ""BUYIN"" -> B-U-Y-I-N: B(1), U(2), Y(3) -> no: we need third letter I? This would be Y at third? Then I at fourth? -> invalid.

    So words where the third letter is I and fourth is N: so the structure is __ I N _

    Possible fifth letters: 
      We need one more letter at the end? For ""BLINK"", it's K; for ""BLIND"", D; ""FLING"", G; ""SWING"", G; ""WHINS"", S; ""QUINS"", S.

    We haven't tested: B, F, L, W, S, Q, etc.

    How to choose? We might prioritize letters we haven't tested that are common.

    We have already eliminated: A, E, O (vowels) -> so we have I and U (if it exists) and Y? 

    We haven't tested U and Y? So choosing a word with U or Y might give us vowel information.

    For example, ""BUILD"" doesn't fit? Because fourth letter is L, not N.

    ""QUINS"": Q-U-I-N-S -> Q not absent? And U is at position 2? Then position: 
        Q(1), U(2), I(3), N(4), S(5) -> good? And U is a vowel we haven't tested.

    Is ""QUINS"" a word? Yes, it's a variant of quint.

    But Q is rare? And U: it's the only vowel possibility? 

    Alternatively, we can choose a word with common consonants? Like S?

    We are also constrained by the fact that we must avoid the absent letters: C,R,A,E,P,O,T.

    Given we are on the third guess? We have 6 guesses total? So far we are making the third guess.

    Strategy: We want to maximize information? Or solve? Since we have three positions and many letters? A guess that covers more possibilities? 

    However, note: we have two positions open: first, second, fifth? Three letters? And we know third and fourth.

    Maybe we can try a word that uses common letters? And covers several possibilities?

    We list the most common letters we haven't tested? Remaining common consonants: S, L, D, M, B, G.

    We had in the first guess: tested C,R,A,N,E -> absent except N.
    Second guess: P,O,I,N,T -> absent except I,N.

    So letters tested: C,R,A,E,N,P,O,T (8 letters). But we know N and I are present? But I we already fixed? And N fixed? So the unknown letters are from the remaining.

    Total tested (and found absent): C,R,A,E,P,O,T -> 7 absent letters.

    Presents: I and N? And we know I and N are fixed? So the secret word has I and N? And two other letters? No: the secret word has five letters: 
        We only know positions 3 and 4. So the rest three are unknown? But we don't know if there are duplicates? But so far? We haven't seen duplicates.

    We can assume no duplicates? But sometimes words have duplicates? Let's be cautious? 

    Possibilities: the secret word has three letters: let's call them L1, L2, L5? They are distinct and not in the absent list? And not I or N? Because if they were I or N, they would appear again? 

    But wait: I and N are in positions 3 and 4? So they might appear only once? Or not? But we don't know? However, in our previous guesses? No duplicates? 

    We might assume that duplicate letters are not present because we have no feedback about duplicates? But that's not reliable.

    So we have to guess arbitrarily.

    Given the candidates:

      ""BLINK"": uses B, L, K
      ""BLIND"": uses B, L, D
      ""FLING"": F, L, G
      ""SWING"": S, W, G
      ""QUINS"": Q, U, S

    We want to get feedback that can help us? Because if we guess a word and get more ✓, we get closer? Or if we get x, we eliminate more.

    Choosing ""QUINS"" uses rare letters? U and Q? And S? It might be inefficient? Because Q is rare? So if we get all x? Then we know only the fixed positions? 

    Better to use common letters? So ""BLINK"", ""BLIND"", ""FLING"", ""SWING""? 

    How common?

      ""SWING"" has S, W, G? S is very common? W and G are medium? 
      ""FLING"" has F, L, G? F and L are common? 
      ""BLINK"" has B, L, K? L is common.
      ""BLIND"" has B, L, D? L is common.

    We haven't eliminated L? So ""L"" appears in many candidates? Therefore, testing L might be beneficial? 

    But note: if we guess a word with L, and if L is in the word? We get feedback? Otherwise we eliminate L.

    However, we have to guess the entire word? We might guess ""FLING"" or ""BLINK""? 

    Let me see frequency in the English language: E, T, A, O, I, N are already handled? But E,A,O,T absent? Then next: S, H, R (but R absent)? R is gone? So we have S common? 

    Therefore, including S might be good? So ""SWING""?

    But note: we haven't tested S? So we could guess ""SWING"": which uses S, W, I, N, G.

    However, the pattern: ? ? I N ? -> so ""SWING"": S at first? W at second? G at fifth? 

    Now? Do we have to use L? Not necessarily? 

    Consider: there might be words without L? 

    We don't know? 

    We can choose ""SWING"" to test S? Then if S is in the word? We get ✓ at position 1? etc.

    Alternative: we note that there aren't many words matching the pattern? So we might want to guess one of the common words? 

    A better approach: we can pick a word that uses letters that cover the possible words? 

    Since we don't know, we pick a common word? Let's pick ""BLINK"" or ""SWING""? 

    I'll go with ""BLINK"" because it has L? But L is also in other candidate words? 

    However, we haven't tested B, L, K? So we guess ""BLINK"" and see.

    If the word is ""BLINK"", we win? If not, we get feedback:

        First letter: if B is correct? Or in the word? But the first position might be another letter.
        Second letter: L? if present? etc.

    But note: we know position 3=I? Position 4=N? So positions 1 and 2 are what we test? And position 5=K? 

    So let's guess ""BLINK"".

<guess>blink</guess>### Analysis of Feedback:
From previous guesses:  
1. **crane**:  
   - C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x) → **N** is in position 4, and **C, R, A, E** are absent.  
2. **point**:  
   - P(x), O(x), I(✓), N(✓), T(x) → **I** is in position 3, **N** is in position 4, and **P, O, T** are absent.  

### Key Constraints:
- **Fixed positions**:  
  - Position 3: **I**  
  - Position 4: **N**  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, E, P, O, T  
- **Unknown positions**: 1, 2, and 5.  

### Strategy:
- The secret word follows the pattern: `[?][?] I N [?]`  
- Choose a word that:  
  - Fits `[?][?] I N [?]`  
  - Uses only letters **not** in the absent set (C, R, A, E, P, O, T).  
  - Prioritizes common letters and maximizes new information (e.g., testing frequent untested letters like S, L, B).  
- Possible candidates:  
  - **BLINK** (tests B, L, K; valid English word with ""I"" at position 3 and ""N"" at position 4).  
  - **BLIND** (tests B, L, D).  
  - **SWING** (tests S, W, G).  
  - **FLING** (tests F, L, G).  
- **Why BLINK?**  
  - **B**, **L**, **K** are common untested letters.  
  - ""L"" appears in multiple candidates (e.g., BLIND, FLING), so testing it could resolve ambiguity.  
  - ""BLINK"" is a high-frequency word that fits the pattern.  

### Next Guess:
Guess **BLINK** to test key new letters (B, L, K) in positions 1, 2, and 5.

<guess>blink</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(✓) N(✓) T(x)
Guess 3: blink -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(✓) I(✓) N(✓) K(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from three guesses:

1. ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)
   → N is in the word and in the correct position (4th)
   → C, R, A, E are not in the word

2. ""point"": P(x), O(x), I(✓), N(✓), T(x)
   → I is in the word and in the correct position (3rd), N is correct (4th)
   → P, O, T are not in the word

3. ""blink"": B(x), L(✓), I(✓), N(✓), K(x)
   → L is in the word and in the correct position (2nd), I and N are correct (3rd and 4th)
   → B and K are not in the word

Now we know:
- The secret word has fixed letters: 
    position 2: L (from ""blink"") → So second letter is L
    position 3: I (from ""point"" and confirmed in ""blink"")
    position 4: N (from ""crane"" and confirmed)
- Thus, the pattern is: _ L I N _
- Absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, O, T, B, K (all marked x)

So the word is: ? L I N ?

We need to fill the first and fifth positions.

Constraints:
- The letters must not be any of the absent letters: C,R,A,E,P,O,T,B,K
- They must be English letters that form a valid 5-letter word.

Possible letters for first and fifth positions: 
   Remaining letters: D, F, G, H, J, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: We have to choose letters that form a valid word of the form: X L I N Y (where X and Y are letters from the allowed set).

Now, let's think of common English words matching this pattern:

- ""ALIGN"" → But A is absent → invalid
- ""FLING"" → F is allowed? F not in absent set? 
   F not in {C,R,A,E,P,O,T,B,K}? 
   Pattern: F(1) L(2) I(3) N(4)? Then fifth? We have ""FLING"": F L I N G → fifth is G?
   So ""FLING"": letters F and G? 
   Check absent: F and G not absent → valid. So candidate.

- ""BLIND"" → B is absent (from third guess: B(x)) → invalid
- ""CLING"" → C absent → invalid
- ""ELFIN"" → E absent → invalid
- ""GLINT"" → G and T? But T is absent → invalid (from ""point"": T(x))
- ""SLING"" → S(1) L(2) I(3) N(4) G(5) → valid? S and G not absent? Yes.
- ""SWING"" → S(1) W(2)? But second letter must be L? → invalid because we have L fixed at second? 
   However, ""swing"" is S-W-I-N-G → second is W, but we know second is L? So not matching? 
   So only words that have L as second letter are considered? So ""swing"" does not fix? Because it has W at second? → invalid for this pattern.

But note: our pattern is fixed: ? L I N ?

Therefore, ""swing"" does not fit? Because its second letter is W? So we must have L at second? So ""swing"" becomes S-W-I-N-G → W in second? But we require second to be L? So no match? → not candidate.

Similarly, ""thing"" → T absent and also not L at second? → invalid.

So other possibilities:

- ""FLINT"" → T absent → invalid
- ""OLINT"" → O absent → invalid

Another: ""MINIS"" → but M-I-N? Then we have I at third? But second letter? MINIS: M(1), I(2) → but second is I, not L? → invalid.

Focus: the word must have the second letter L? So ... but ""align"" has A as second? No, align: A-L-I-G-N? 
  Positions: A(1), L(2), I(3), G(4)? No! We need N at fourth? So ""align"" has G at fourth? Not N? → invalid.

""FLINT"" has T at fifth? And T absent? But also FLINT: F-L-I-N-T → but T absent? → invalid.

So let's list words:

  ""FLING"": F-L-I-N-G → F(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), G(5) → valid? Letters: F,G not absent → good.

  ""SLING"": S-L-I-N-G → S(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), G(5) → letters S,G not absent → good.

  ""STING"" → T absent? → invalid.

  ""LYING"" → Y at third? But we have to have I at third? So L(1), Y(2)? Wait: pattern is _ L I N _? So ""LYING"": L(1), Y(2), I(3) -- wait, that fits? Then N(4)? But ""LYING"" doesn't have N? It has L-Y-I-N-G: L(1), Y(2), I(3), N(4), G(5) → yes! 

But wait: ""LYING"": L-Y-I-N-G → matches the pattern: 
   first: Y? No: 
      Position 1: L? That would be L, then position 2: Y? But we require position 2 to be L? → contradiction? 
   Because: we need position 2 to be L? So:
      Position 1: first letter?
      Position 2: L
      Position 3: I
      Position 4: N
      Position 5: fifth?

So in ""LYING"": 
   L is at position 1 (first letter) → and then Y is at position 2? But we require the second letter to be L? So in ""LYING"", position 2 is Y? So it doesn't have L at position 2 → it has L at position 1? Therefore, it does not match? 

But we know the word must have L at position 2? So our pattern: [unknown first] L I N [unknown fifth].

Therefore, words must look like: X L I N Y.

So ""FLING"": 
   F at first: position1
   L at position2 (fixed) → yes
   I at position3 → yes
   N at position4 → yes
   G at fifth → yes

Similarly, ""SLING"": S L I N G → fits.

Also, ""ULNA"" is only four letters? Not five.

Another word: ""CLINK"" → C absent → invalid.

""BLINS"" → B? But B absent → invalid.

Now, what about ""FLIGHT""? Too long? Only five letters.

Another possibility: ""DAVEN"" → D-A-V-E-N → includes A and E? Absent → invalid.

So we have at least two candidates:
  ""FLING"" and ""SLING""

Also, are there more? 

  ""GLINT"": G-L-I-N-T? But T is absent → invalid.
  ""ELAND"": E? absent → invalid.
  ""QUEEN"": Q? and E? → invalid.

Another: ""OLIVE"" → O absent? and doesn't match pattern? Second letter must be L? Does ""OLIVE"" have L at second? O-L-I-V-E → yes? But O is absent? → invalid.

Therefore: FLING and SLING are strong candidates.

But note: we haven't tested F, S, G? But we can choose one? 

We need to pick one to guess? 

We are on the fourth guess? Total guesses are 6? So we can try one? 

But note: if we guess one? And it's incorrect? We eliminate? 

But then we guess the other? We might win with two guesses? But we have three guesses left? 

Alternatively, consider words that use new letters? 

But we don't have much constraints? 

We can also consider: the word could have duplicate letters? But so far: all letters we know (L,I,N) are distinct? So probably the first and fifth are distinct? 

But we don't know? 

Both candidates have the fifth letter G? So if we guess and it becomes ✓? Then we know? 

But actually: 
   ""FLING"" has F at first and G at fifth.
   ""SLING"" has S at first and G at fifth.

So the difference is first letter: F vs S? 

We haven't eliminated F or S? 

So we choose one? 

We want to maximize information? 

Alternatively, we can pick a word that uses a letter not G? For example, if we want to test more letters? But both candidates have G? 

But note: we are forced to use the pattern? So we have to choose a word that matches ? L I N ?

If we choose a word that doesn't have G? Then we test another letter? 

Let me search for words that match ? L I N ?

Other than FLING and SLING? 

Possible:
   ""MLINE"" → M? and E? E is absent → invalid.
   ""ULNAR"" → U-L-N-A-R? But second letter? U-L: L is second? Then position 3: N? But we need I? So U-L-N? Not I → invalid.
   ""ALIGN"" has A (absent).
   ""ELINT"" has E (absent).
   ""FLINT"" has T (absent).
   ""SLINK"" → S-L-I-N-K? But K is absent (from ""blink"": K(x)) → invalid.
   ""SLIMY"" → S-L-I-M-Y? Positions: S(1), L(2), I(3), M(4) → but we need N at fourth → invalid.

Another possibility: ""QUALM"" → but no I? → no.

So really? Only FLING and SLING? 

Wait: but ""SLING"" and ""FLING"" are both valid? 

Now, we can choose one? And then if it fails? We adjust? 

We have two letters to test: at first: F or S? And fifth: G? 

If we guess ""SLING"":

  If correct: win.
  If not: then the word must be ""FLING""?

Because there are no other candidates? Or are there?

What about ""GLIST""? G-L-I-S-T? But T absent → invalid.

""SLICE"" → E? absent → invalid.

So really only two? 

Therefore, we can pick one? 

But we must choose an English word? 

So let me choose ""SLING"" because S is more common? 

But F and S both common? 

Alternatively? We might pick ""FLING""? 

But I'll choose ""SLING"" because I feel like it? 

But then the fifth letter is G? So if we get:

    S(?) L(✓) I(✓) N(✓) G(?)

How about G? It could be ""x"" if not? But in ""FLING"", G is at fifth? So if G is correct? Then only the first matters? 

But note: if we guess ""SLING"" and the word is ""FLING"", then:

   S(x) ? because S is not in the word? So S will get x? and L(✓), I(✓), N(✓), G(✓)? because G is at fifth? But then we get S(x) and G(✓)? 

Therefore, we can deduce the first letter? 

But we don't know the first letter? 

Therefore, we guess ""SLING"": 

   If feedback: 
      S -> ? (it could be ✓ or x or -? But in this case? For ""FLING"": S is not present? So x)
      L -> ✓
      I -> ✓
      N -> ✓
      G -> ✓

   So if the fifth letter is G? Then we get ✓ for G? 

   Then if S is x? Then the word must be ""FLING""? 

   Alternatively, if the fifth letter is something else? Then both words? But we don't have? 

   But wait: we don't have other words? 

Therefore, if we guess ""SLING"" and get:

   - First letter feedback:
          ✓: then win? because S at first? So SLING?
          x: then FLING?

   And fifth: G? ✓? because in both candidates? 

But wait: both ""FLING"" and ""SLING"" have G at fifth? So we expect G to be ✓? 

Therefore, we can guess ""SLING""? And then if S is ✓? win? If S is x? then FLING? 

But we have a problem? What if the fifth letter isn't G? Then we have missed? 

But we thought there were only FLING and SLING? So fifth letter must be G? 

Because we assumed? 

But what else? 

Let me double-check? 

We have pattern: ? L I N ? 

Possible words? We found:
  FLING, SLING

Are there others?

Let's expand:

  Words: 
    - F L I N G 
    - S L I N G 

But what about? 

  ""GUILD"" → G-U-I-L-D → second letter U? not L? no.

  ""BRINS"" → B absent? R absent → invalid.

  ""AHIND"" → A absent? and E? absent → invalid.

  ""YELLN"" → Y-E-L-L-N → E absent and not five letters? 

Wait: we must have five letters? 

Another: perhaps ""WELSH"" → W-E-L-S-H → E absent → invalid.

Or ""ZYLON"" → Z-Y-L-O-N → O absent → invalid.

I think we are safe: only FLING and SLING? 

So we choose ""SLING"" as a guess? 

Then we get: 
   S for the first letter? if it is ✓? then SLING? 
   else? then FLING? 

So we guess ""SLING""

But note: the fifth letter? In both cases? In FLING? G at fifth? so in ""SLING"" guess? G at fifth? So we get ✓ for G? 

Therefore, if S is ✓? we win? 
If S is x? then we know the word has F at first? and then fifth letter G? so we guess FLING next? 

We have three guesses left? Enough.

So let's guess ""SLING""

However, if the word is not either? then we have a problem? But we think it's unlikely? 

But in standard Wordle? We should choose valid words? 

Therefore:

<guess>sling</guess> 

But note: we are guessing a word? So we output SLING? 

But let me confirm: 

   ""SLING"" matches the pattern: S (first), L(second) -> must be L? and then I? N? and then G? 

   And avoids all absent letters? Yes: S, L, I, N, G? and L, I, N are known? So we test S and G? 

Yes.Based on the previous feedback:

- **C, R, A, E, P, O, T, B, K** are **absent**.
- **Position 2 is L**, **position 3 is I**, and **position 4 is N**.
- The secret word pattern is: **`[?] L I N [?]`**.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Fixed Positions**:  
   - The second letter must be **L** (from Guess 3: `blink` → L(✓)).  
   - The third letter must be **I** (from Guess 2: `point` → I(✓)).  
   - The fourth letter must be **N** (from Guess 1: `crane` → N(✓)).  

2. **Absent Letters**:  
   - Eliminated letters: **C, R, A, E, P, O, T, B, K**.  
   - Valid letters for positions 1 and 5 are **D, F, G, H, J, M, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.  

3. **Possible Words**:  
   - Words must match the pattern `[?] L I N [?]`.  
   - Common valid English candidates:  
     - **`FLING`** (F at position 1, G at position 5) → Tests **F** and **G**.  
     - **`SLING`** (S at position 1, G at position 5) → Tests **S** and **G**.  
   - Both are high-frequency words fitting the pattern.  

4. **Selection Strategy**:  
   - Prioritize coverage of new letters. **S** is a highly common untested letter (more frequent than F).  
   - Guessing **`SLING`** maximizes information:
     - If **S** is correct (✓), the word is **`SLING`**.  
     - If **S** is absent (x), the word is likely **`FLING`**.  
   - **G** is shared in both candidates, so its feedback (likely ✓) is less diagnostic.  

5. **Final Choice**:  
   - **`SLING`** narrows down the solution efficiently with minimal risk, leveraging common letters.  

### Next Guess:
- Guessing **`SLING`** tests **S** at position 1 and **G** at position 5, while confirming fixed positions (L, I, N).

The fourth letter of the secret word is N.\n  2. The letters C, R, A, E are not in the secret word at all.\n\n Therefore, we must avoid using C, R, A, E in our next guess.\n\n Also, since N is in the fourth position, our next guess must have N in the fourth position.\n\n Now, we need to choose a word that:\n  - Has N as the fourth letter.\n  - Contains only letters that are not C, R, A, E (and possibly other excluded letters, but so far only these).\n  - Uses other common letters to maximize information.\n\n Since we have eliminated some vowels (A, E), we have left: vowels -> I, O, U (and sometimes Y).\n Consonants: many left, such as B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n We also know that the word does not contain R, so we avoid that.\n\n Let\'s think of words that have N in the fourth position.\n\n Common pattern: _ _ _ N _\n\n We have to fill in the first, second, third, and fifth positions.\n\n We should avoid letters that are known to be absent: C, R, A, E.\n\n Possible words? Let\'s brainstorm:\n\n  - Using common letters: S, T, L, O, P, etc.\n\n Examples:\n  ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> This has no C,R,A,E and N at the fourth position? \n    Breakdown: \n      Position: 1: P, 2: O, 3: I, 4: N, 5: T\n    But wait, our feedback only said N is in the fourth position, but the word ""point"" has N at the fourth? Actually, yes: \n      P (1st), O (2nd), I (3rd), N (4th), T (5th). So that fits.\n\n  Other possibilities:\n    ""JOINT"": J, O, I, N, T -> also okay, but J is less common.\n    ""MOUNT"": M, O, U, N, T -> avoids the bad letters? M,O,U,N,T: no C,R,A,E -> okay.\n    ""COUNT"": But C is excluded -> not allowed, because C is absent in the secret word.\n\n We must avoid C, so ""count"" is out.\n\n Other words: ""BLUNT"", ""FLINT"", ""GRANT"" (but G,R,A: R and A are excluded) -> so ""GRANT"" is invalid because of R and A.\n\n After eliminating, let\'s consider:\n\n  ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> good.\n  ""MOUNT"": M, O, U, N, T -> good.\n  ""TOWNS"": T, O, W, N, S -> avoids bad letters? T,O,W,N,S: no C,R,A,E -> good.\n\n But note: the feedback for ""crane"" showed that N is in the correct position (fourth). So we must have N in the fourth.\n\n Now, we want to test for other common letters. Since we have eliminated A and E, we can test O and U (vowels) and common consonants like T, S, L, P, etc.\n\n Considering ""POINT"": \n   It lets us check P, O, I, T (in addition to the known N).\n\n ""MOUNT"": checks M, O, U, T.\n\n We might also consider ""MINTS"", but note the feedback only said N is in the fourth letter, and we don\'t know about duplicates. But the word ""minst"" isn\'t common? Actually, ""MINTS"": M-I-N-T-S. This has S at the end and T. But note: we are guessing and the word must be valid.\n\n However, we have to be cautious: we don\'t know if the word has repeated letters? But since we haven\'t encountered duplicates yet, we assume a word without duplication for now? Actually, the rules don\'t prohibit duplicates, but in this case we are guessing a new word without using the letters we know are absent.\n\n But note: we are limited by the fact that C, R, A, E cannot be in the word. Also, we must have N in the fourth position.\n\n Let\'s choose a word that uses letters we haven\'t tested so that we get more coverage.\n\n Previously in ""crane"", we tested C,R,A,N,E. Now we avoid those. So we want to use:\n\n   Possible letters: \n     Vowels: I, O, U (and Y)\n     Consonants: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,S,T,V,W,X,Y,Z\n\n However, we don\'t know about all letters. We tested: C,R,A,E -> absent.\n\n Now, if we choose ""POINT"", we are testing P, O, I, T (and N we know is in the fourth).\n\n If we choose ""MOUNT"", we test M, O, U, T.\n\n Another option: ""SHUNT"" (S,H,U,N,T) -> H and U are new.\n\n We need to get as many new letters as possible.\n\n Let\'s look for words that have many common letters we haven\'t tried.\n\n Considering common consonants: S, T, L are very common. We haven\'t tried S, T, L? \n\n In ""crane"", we did T? No: C,R,A,N,E didn\'t include T.\n\n So we can try to include S and T and L.\n\n Example: ""POINT"" has T at the end? Yes.\n\n Or ""SPOIL"": but fourth letter must be N -> not N? No, wait: S-P-O-I-L -> fourth is I? So not N? Therefore, we must have fourth letter N.\n\n Another word: ""LUNTS"" -> L-U-N-T-S -> fourth letter is N? Let\'s see: \n   L (1), U (2), N (3), T (4), S (5) -> that would have N at the third, not fourth? \n   We need: _ _ _ N _ -> so the fourth is N, meaning positions: \n     1st: ?, 2nd: ?, 3rd: ?, 4th: N, 5th: ?\n\n So we need the fourth letter to be the fourth character: the third character can be any letter.\n\n Therefore, ""LUNTS"" would be: L-U-N-T? Then it would be L (1), U (2), N (3) -> but we need N at the fourth? So that doesn\'t fit.\n\n Actually, the word ""lunts"" is L-U-N-T: but that\'s five letters? \n   - Actually, it would be: position 1: L, 2: U, 3: N, 4: T, 5: S? \n   Then N is at the third? So not fourth.\n\n How about ""JOINS""? J-O-I-N-S: \n   Position: J (1), O (2), I (3), N (4), S (5) -> perfect.\n\n But J is less common, so maybe not the best.\n\n How about ""COINS""? But C is excluded -> invalid.\n\n How about ""POINT"": P-O-I-N-T -> P(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> this works.\n\n How about ""JOINT""? Same as above but J. \n\n Another word: ""TAWNY"": T-A-W-N-Y -> but A is excluded -> invalid.\n\n ""DOWNY"": D-O-W-N-Y -> D(1), O(2), W(3), N(4), Y(5). This avoids excluded letters? \n   D: not excluded? \n   O: okay.\n   W: okay.\n   N: okay (but already known at fourth).\n   Y: okay.\n\n But wait, we have to avoid A and E? Yes. So ""DOWNY"" is acceptable? \n   However, we know A is excluded, so ""DOWNY"" doesn\'t have A or the others.\n\n So ""DOWNY"" is a candidate.\n\n However, we don\'t want to use too many rare letters? And we are trying to get information.\n\n Let me compare:\n\n  Candidate words:\n\n   ""POINT"": letters -> P, O, I, T (and N)\n   ""JOINT"": J is rare -> avoid?\n   ""DOWNY"": D, O, W, Y -> D and W and Y are not as common? But why not? They are valid.\n\n   Another one: ""TOWN\'S"" isn\'t valid? ""TOWNS"": T-O-W-N-S -> T(1), O(2), W(3), N(4), S(5) -> good.\n\n   ""MINUS"": M-I-N-U-S -> M(1), I(2), N(3), U(4), S(5) -> N is at the third? Not fourth -> invalid.\n\n So we must have the fourth letter N.\n\n Another candidate: ""BORNS""? But B-O-R-N-S: R is excluded? We have R in ""crane"" and feedback said R is not in the word -> so cannot use R.\n\n Therefore, ""BORNS"" is invalid.\n\n How about ""SONGS""? S-O-N-G-S: the fourth letter is the fourth character: \n   S(1), O(2), N(3) -> wait, then G(4), S(5)? So N is at third? And G at fourth? Not correct.\n\n We must have the fourth letter being N: the word must be in the form ???N?.\n\n So ""SONGS"" doesn\'t have the fourth letter as N? Actually, \n   S -> first\n   O -> second\n   N -> third? \n   G -> fourth\n   S -> fifth\n\n So we need the N in the fourth? So if we had ""SOGND"" that doesn\'t make sense.\n\n Another candidate: ""BUNKS"": B-U-N-K-S -> B(1), U(2), N(3) -> N is third? Then K(4), S(5) -> no.\n\n ""PUNKS"": same problem: P(1), U(2), N(3), K(4), S(5) -> N at third.\n\n How about ""PLANK"": P-L-A-N-K -> but A is excluded -> invalid.\n\n ""BLINK"": B-L-I-N-K -> B(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), K(5) -> good. However, we haven\'t eliminated B,L,I,K? No, because only C,R,A,E are gone. So valid.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if the word has I or not? So ""BLINK"" is a candidate.\n\n Now, comparing:\n\n   POINT: uses P,O,I,T\n   BLINK: uses B,L,I,N,K -> but we already know N? But we are testing B,L,I,K.\n   TOWNS: uses T,O,W,N,S\n\n We want to maximize coverage of new letters.\n\n Previously used: C, R, A, N, E (but N is known, and the others absent except N).\n So we have used 5 letters: C,R,A,N,E.\n\n For the next guess, we can include N because we know it\'s in the word and we are using it in the correct position? But we are also testing other letters.\n\n Idea: choose a word that uses as many new letters as possible.\n\n Considering:\n\n   POINT: P, O, I, T -> all new? and N (we know is present, so only feedback on new letters).\n\n   BLINK: B, L, I, K -> and N -> all new? \n\n   TOWNS: T, O, W, N, S -> T, O, W, S new.\n\n But note: in BLINK, the letter I is at the third position? We are testing I? That\'s fine.\n\n However, we are only on the second guess, so we don\'t have many constraints.\n\n I think ""POINT"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters.\n\n Another candidate: ""SPOIL"" -> but we need fourth letter N? Not possible.\n\n Let\'s go with ""POINT"". It has the form: \n   Position 1: P, Position 2: O, Position 3: I, Position 4: N, Position 5: T.\n\n This fits the pattern.\n\n So we guess ""POINT"".\n\n<guess>point</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  \n- **C, R, A, E** are **NOT** in the secret word (marked ""x"").  \n- **N** is **CORRECTLY** placed in the 4th position (marked ""✓"").  \n\n### Strategy for Second Guess:\n- The secret word has **N in the 4th position** and excludes **C, R, A, E**.  \n- Choose a word that:  \n  - Has **N as the 4th letter**.  \n  - Uses common unused letters (e.g., **S, T, L, O, P**, since vowels **I, O, U** are untested).  \n  - Avoids **C, R, A, E**.  \n- Good candidates: POINT, TOWN, JOINT, BLINK, MOUNT.  \n- Selected **""POINT""** because it:  \n  - Maximizes new common letters (**P, O, I, T**).  \n  - Fits the constraint (N in position 4: P-O-**I-N-T**).  \n  - Is a common English word.  \n\nNow guessing ""POINT"" to test new positions and letters.\n\n<guess>point</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(✓) N(✓) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nFirst guess: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\nSecond guess: ""point"" -> Feedback: P(x) O(x) I(✓) N(✓) T(x)\n\nFrom this, we know:\n\n1. The secret word has the **fourth letter (position 4) as N**. \n2. The secret word has the **third letter (position 3) as I** (since in ""point"", I is at position 3, and it got a ✓).\n3. Letters **C, R, A, E, P, O, T** are **not** in the word (based on both feedbacks).\n   - Specifically, absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, O, T.\n\nTherefore, we can summarize:\n\n- Positions:\n   - Position 3: I (correct)\n   - Position 4: N (correct)\n- Absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, O, T\n\nNow, the secret word pattern is: ? ? I N ?\n\nWe need to fill in the first, second, and fifth positions with letters that are:\n   - not C, R, A, E, P, O, T\n   - and must be English letters.\n\nAdditionally, since we are constrained by the absent letters, we must choose from the remaining consonants and vowels. Note that vowels left: U, and sometimes Y. Consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut note that Y can be used as a vowel or consonant.\n\nMoreover, we must form a valid English word of the form: [letter1][letter2] I N [letter5]\n\nLet\'s think of possible words:\n\nThe pattern: ? ? I N ?\n\nWe avoid the absent letters: so the first, second, and fifth positions must not contain C,R,A,E,P,O,T.\n\nConsider common possibilities:\n\n- For the first letter: possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, S, W, etc.\n- For the second letter: similar, and consider common combinations.\n\nExamples:\n\n  ""SPI N"" -> but S? Wait, let\'s look: \n    The word could be: \n    S _ I N _ ? But the second letter cannot be O (absent) or T? Absent. \n    Possibilities: ""SPIN_"" -> but P is absent? So no: P is absent -> cannot use P.\n\n  Instead, let\'s list words ending with ""IN"" (but note we need fifth letter).\n\n  Common patterns: words like:\n    ""BEGIN"": B-E-G-I-N? But position: E would be second? But E is absent -> invalid.\n    ""CHAIN"": C present -> invalid, and A absent.\n    ""BRING"": B-R-I-N-G -> R absent -> invalid.\n    ""BLINK"": B-L-I-N-K -> L at second? But we have feedback that O and T are absent? Not in this. Now, letters: B, L, I, N, K -> I and N are set. Letters B, L, K are new. \n      Check absent: C,R,A,E,P,O,T -> B not absent? L not absent? K not absent? -> valid.\n      Pattern: B(1) L(2) I(3) N(4) K(5) -> matches.\n\n    ""S I N K"": S? But we need two letters before I? No: structure is ? ? I N ? -> so three letters: first, second, third=I, fourth=N, fifth=?\n    ""S K I N"": would be first=S, second=K, third=I -> but then fourth? Not I? No.\n\n    Actually, the word ""skin"" is S-K-I-N -> only four letters? No, we need five letters: positions are fixed: third is I, fourth is N? \n        Then what about ""SKINN"" (double N)? Not a word.\n\n    So let\'s think of five-letter words having I in third and N in fourth.\n\n    Other words:\n      ""BAKIN"" -> not a word? Actually, ""baking"" is six letters.\n      ""BEGIN"" doesn\'t work because E? \n      ""BLUIN"" -> not a word.\n      ""QUINS"" -> Q-U-I-N-S: \n          Position: 1=Q, 2=U, 3=I (matches), 4=N (matches), 5=S -> but is ""quins"" a word? It is an uncommon word? We might avoid uncommon words.\n\n    Another: ""WHINS"" -> W-H-I-N-S: \n        Position: W (1), H (2), I (3), N (4), S (5) -> good? Is it valid? ""whins"" is a word (a type of plant).\n\n    But note: we have H and W, which we haven\'t tested? And no conflict.\n\n    Other possibilities:\n      ""BLIND"": B-L-I-N-D -> D at fifth? But letters: B, L, D -> as long as these are not absent? They are not. So valid.\n\n    But wait, earlier feedback? We don\'t know about L? So it\'s okay.\n\n    So we have two strong candidates:\n      ""BLINK"": letters B, L, I, N, K -> positions: B(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), K(5)\n      ""BLIND"": B(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), D(5)\n\n    But how to choose? We need to test new letters? Also, note that we haven\'t tested: B, L, K, D, H, W, etc.\n\n    We should also consider the frequency of letters? And if there are other constraints.\n\n    After ""point"", we know that the solution pattern is: ? ? I N ?\n\n    We must avoid the absent letters: C,R,A,E,P,O,T.\n\n    Now, let\'s list all possible words? Not exhaustive, but we can think:\n\n      Common words:\n        ""BLINK""\n        ""BLIND""\n        ""BRING"" -> R absent -> invalid.\n        ""BUILD"" -> U-I? But third letter I? BUILD: B-U-I-L-D -> then positions: B(1), U(2), I(3) -> matches, L(4)? but we need fourth=N -> L is fourth, not N -> no; also the fourth would be L -> but we require N in the fourth -> invalid.\n        ""CHINK"": C? absent -> invalid.\n        ""FLING"": F-L-I-N-G -> F(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), G(5) -> valid? G not absent? yes? But wait we haven\'t mentioned F, L, G.\n        ""MINIM"" -> M-I-N-I-M: positions: M(1), I(2)? I(3)? ""MINIM"" -> M(1), I(2), N(3), I(4), M(5) -> doesn\'t match: we need third=I? This has second=I? and third=N? Then it would be I at second, N at third -> doesn\'t match.\n\n        Actually, let\'s break down ""FLING"": F-L-I-N-G -> \n          1st: F, 2nd: L, 3rd: I -> yes, 4th: N -> yes, 5th: G -> good? But note ""G"" is allowed.\n\n        So we have ""FLING"" as candidate.\n\n      Another: ""KUZIN"" -> not common.\n\n    Considering frequency and commonality:\n\n      ""BLINK"" is a common word -> valid.\n\n      Also ""BLIND"": common.\n\n      ""FLING"": common.\n\n      ""THYMI"" -> not valid? Not a word.\n\n    However, we must choose one.\n\n    Let me see which one gives more information:\n\n      We want to test letters that are likely? Also, we have only one occurrence of I? But we know the position. And we know N.\n\n      Our goal is to guess the entire word? But we have three positions unknown: first, second, and fifth.\n\n      If we guess ""BLINK"", then:\n\n        If the word is ""BLINK"", we win.\n        Otherwise, we get feedback: \n          Which of B, L, K are correct? And the positions? But note, the fifth position might be something else.\n\n      Similarly for ""BLIND"" or ""FLING"".\n\n    Another candidate: ""OWING"" -> O is absent? Avoid O -> invalid.\n\n    Let me think of more: \n\n      ""SWING"": S-W-I-N-G -> S(1), W(2), I(3), N(4), G(5) -> and O, T? No, we don\'t include O or T? So S,W,G are not absent -> valid? But wait: we have feedback that O and T are absent? So we are not using O or T -> correct? Yes.\n\n    However, we already have:\n\n        ""BLINK"": B,L,K\n        ""BLIND"": B,L,D\n        ""FLING"": F,L,G\n        ""SWING"": S,W,G\n\n    Also possible: ""BUYIN"" -> B-U-Y-I-N: B(1), U(2), Y(3) -> no: we need third letter I? This would be Y at third? Then I at fourth? -> invalid.\n\n    So words where the third letter is I and fourth is N: so the structure is __ I N _\n\n    Possible fifth letters: \n      We need one more letter at the end? For ""BLINK"", it\'s K; for ""BLIND"", D; ""FLING"", G; ""SWING"", G; ""WHINS"", S; ""QUINS"", S.\n\n    We haven\'t tested: B, F, L, W, S, Q, etc.\n\n    How to choose? We might prioritize letters we haven\'t tested that are common.\n\n    We have already eliminated: A, E, O (vowels) -> so we have I and U (if it exists) and Y? \n\n    We haven\'t tested U and Y? So choosing a word with U or Y might give us vowel information.\n\n    For example, ""BUILD"" doesn\'t fit? Because fourth letter is L, not N.\n\n    ""QUINS"": Q-U-I-N-S -> Q not absent? And U is at position 2? Then position: \n        Q(1), U(2), I(3), N(4), S(5) -> good? And U is a vowel we haven\'t tested.\n\n    Is ""QUINS"" a word? Yes, it\'s a variant of quint.\n\n    But Q is rare? And U: it\'s the only vowel possibility? \n\n    Alternatively, we can choose a word with common consonants? Like S?\n\n    We are also constrained by the fact that we must avoid the absent letters: C,R,A,E,P,O,T.\n\n    Given we are on the third guess? We have 6 guesses total? So far we are making the third guess.\n\n    Strategy: We want to maximize information? Or solve? Since we have three positions and many letters? A guess that covers more possibilities? \n\n    However, note: we have two positions open: first, second, fifth? Three letters? And we know third and fourth.\n\n    Maybe we can try a word that uses common letters? And covers several possibilities?\n\n    We list the most common letters we haven\'t tested? Remaining common consonants: S, L, D, M, B, G.\n\n    We had in the first guess: tested C,R,A,N,E -> absent except N.\n    Second guess: P,O,I,N,T -> absent except I,N.\n\n    So letters tested: C,R,A,E,N,P,O,T (8 letters). But we know N and I are present? But I we already fixed? And N fixed? So the unknown letters are from the remaining.\n\n    Total tested (and found absent): C,R,A,E,P,O,T -> 7 absent letters.\n\n    Presents: I and N? And we know I and N are fixed? So the secret word has I and N? And two other letters? No: the secret word has five letters: \n        We only know positions 3 and 4. So the rest three are unknown? But we don\'t know if there are duplicates? But so far? We haven\'t seen duplicates.\n\n    We can assume no duplicates? But sometimes words have duplicates? Let\'s be cautious? \n\n    Possibilities: the secret word has three letters: let\'s call them L1, L2, L5? They are distinct and not in the absent list? And not I or N? Because if they were I or N, they would appear again? \n\n    But wait: I and N are in positions 3 and 4? So they might appear only once? Or not? But we don\'t know? However, in our previous guesses? No duplicates? \n\n    We might assume that duplicate letters are not present because we have no feedback about duplicates? But that\'s not reliable.\n\n    So we have to guess arbitrarily.\n\n    Given the candidates:\n\n      ""BLINK"": uses B, L, K\n      ""BLIND"": uses B, L, D\n      ""FLING"": F, L, G\n      ""SWING"": S, W, G\n      ""QUINS"": Q, U, S\n\n    We want to get feedback that can help us? Because if we guess a word and get more ✓, we get closer? Or if we get x, we eliminate more.\n\n    Choosing ""QUINS"" uses rare letters? U and Q? And S? It might be inefficient? Because Q is rare? So if we get all x? Then we know only the fixed positions? \n\n    Better to use common letters? So ""BLINK"", ""BLIND"", ""FLING"", ""SWING""? \n\n    How common?\n\n      ""SWING"" has S, W, G? S is very common? W and G are medium? \n      ""FLING"" has F, L, G? F and L are common? \n      ""BLINK"" has B, L, K? L is common.\n      ""BLIND"" has B, L, D? L is common.\n\n    We haven\'t eliminated L? So ""L"" appears in many candidates? Therefore, testing L might be beneficial? \n\n    But note: if we guess a word with L, and if L is in the word? We get feedback? Otherwise we eliminate L.\n\n    However, we have to guess the entire word? We might guess ""FLING"" or ""BLINK""? \n\n    Let me see frequency in the English language: E, T, A, O, I, N are already handled? But E,A,O,T absent? Then next: S, H, R (but R absent)? R is gone? So we have S common? \n\n    Therefore, including S might be good? So ""SWING""?\n\n    But note: we haven\'t tested S? So we could guess ""SWING"": which uses S, W, I, N, G.\n\n    However, the pattern: ? ? I N ? -> so ""SWING"": S at first? W at second? G at fifth? \n\n    Now? Do we have to use L? Not necessarily? \n\n    Consider: there might be words without L? \n\n    We don\'t know? \n\n    We can choose ""SWING"" to test S? Then if S is in the word? We get ✓ at position 1? etc.\n\n    Alternative: we note that there aren\'t many words matching the pattern? So we might want to guess one of the common words? \n\n    A better approach: we can pick a word that uses letters that cover the possible words? \n\n    Since we don\'t know, we pick a common word? Let\'s pick ""BLINK"" or ""SWING""? \n\n    I\'ll go with ""BLINK"" because it has L? But L is also in other candidate words? \n\n    However, we haven\'t tested B, L, K? So we guess ""BLINK"" and see.\n\n    If the word is ""BLINK"", we win? If not, we get feedback:\n\n        First letter: if B is correct? Or in the word? But the first position might be another letter.\n        Second letter: L? if present? etc.\n\n    But note: we know position 3=I? Position 4=N? So positions 1 and 2 are what we test? And position 5=K? \n\n    So let\'s guess ""BLINK"".\n\n<guess>blink</guess>### Analysis of Feedback:\nFrom previous guesses:  \n1. **crane**:  \n   - C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x) → **N** is in position 4, and **C, R, A, E** are absent.  \n2. **point**:  \n   - P(x), O(x), I(✓), N(✓), T(x) → **I** is in position 3, **N** is in position 4, and **P, O, T** are absent.  \n\n### Key Constraints:\n- **Fixed positions**:  \n  - Position 3: **I**  \n  - Position 4: **N**  \n- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, E, P, O, T  \n- **Unknown positions**: 1, 2, and 5.  \n\n### Strategy:\n- The secret word follows the pattern: `[?][?] I N [?]`  \n- Choose a word that:  \n  - Fits `[?][?] I N [?]`  \n  - Uses only letters **not** in the absent set (C, R, A, E, P, O, T).  \n  - Prioritizes common letters and maximizes new information (e.g., testing frequent untested letters like S, L, B).  \n- Possible candidates:  \n  - **BLINK** (tests B, L, K; valid English word with ""I"" at position 3 and ""N"" at position 4).  \n  - **BLIND** (tests B, L, D).  \n  - **SWING** (tests S, W, G).  \n  - **FLING** (tests F, L, G).  \n- **Why BLINK?**  \n  - **B**, **L**, **K** are common untested letters.  \n  - ""L"" appears in multiple candidates (e.g., BLIND, FLING), so testing it could resolve ambiguity.  \n  - ""BLINK"" is a high-frequency word that fits the pattern.  \n\n### Next Guess:\nGuess **BLINK** to test key new letters (B, L, K) in positions 1, 2, and 5.\n\n<guess>blink</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(✓) N(✓) T(x)\nGuess 3: blink -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(✓) I(✓) N(✓) K(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\n1.

L I N ?\n\nWe need to fill the first and fifth positions.\n\nConstraints:\n- The letters must not be any of the absent letters: C,R,A,E,P,O,T,B,K\n- They must be English letters that form a valid 5-letter word.\n\nPossible letters for first and fifth positions: \n   Remaining letters: D, F, G, H, J, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nBut note: We have to choose letters that form a valid word of the form: X L I N Y (where X and Y are letters from the allowed set).\n\nNow, let\'s think of common English words matching this pattern:\n\n- ""ALIGN"" → But A is absent → invalid\n- ""FLING"" → F is allowed? F not in absent set? \n   F not in {C,R,A,E,P,O,T,B,K}? \n   Pattern: F(1) L(2) I(3) N(4)? Then fifth? We have ""FLING"": F L I N G → fifth is G?\n   So ""FLING"": letters F and G? \n   Check absent: F and G not absent → valid. So candidate.\n\n- ""BLIND"" → B is absent (from third guess: B(x)) → invalid\n- ""CLING"" → C absent → invalid\n- ""ELFIN"" → E absent → invalid\n- ""GLINT"" → G and T? But T is absent → invalid (from ""point"": T(x))\n- ""SLING"" → S(1) L(2) I(3) N(4) G(5) → valid? S and G not absent? Yes.\n- ""SWING"" → S(1) W(2)? But second letter must be L? → invalid because we have L fixed at second? \n   However, ""swing"" is S-W-I-N-G → second is W, but we know second is L? So not matching? \n   So only words that have L as second letter are considered? So ""swing"" does not fix? Because it has W at second? → invalid for this pattern.\n\nBut note: our pattern is fixed: ? L I N ?\n\nTherefore, ""swing"" does not fit? Because its second letter is W? So we must have L at second? So ""swing"" becomes S-W-I-N-G → W in second? But we require second to be L? So no match? → not candidate.\n\nSimilarly, ""thing"" → T absent and also not L at second? → invalid.\n\nSo other possibilities:\n\n- ""FLINT"" → T absent → invalid\n- ""OLINT"" → O absent → invalid\n\nAnother: ""MINIS"" → but M-I-N? Then we have I at third? But second letter? MINIS: M(1), I(2) → but second is I, not L? → invalid.\n\nFocus: the word must have the second letter L? So ... but ""align"" has A as second? No, align: A-L-I-G-N? \n  Positions: A(1), L(2), I(3), G(4)? No! We need N at fourth? So ""align"" has G at fourth? Not N? → invalid.\n\n""FLINT"" has T at fifth? And T absent? But also FLINT: F-L-I-N-T → but T absent? → invalid.\n\nSo let\'s list words:\n\n  ""FLING"": F-L-I-N-G → F(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), G(5) → valid? Letters: F,G not absent → good.\n\n  ""SLING"": S-L-I-N-G → S(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), G(5) → letters S,G not absent → good.\n\n  ""STING"" → T absent? → invalid.\n\n  ""LYING"" → Y at third? But we have to have I at third? So L(1), Y(2)? Wait: pattern is _ L I N _? So ""LYING"": L(1), Y(2), I(3) -- wait, that fits? Then N(4)? But ""LYING"" doesn\'t have N? It has L-Y-I-N-G: L(1), Y(2), I(3), N(4), G(5) → yes! \n\nBut wait: ""LYING"": L-Y-I-N-G → matches the pattern: \n   first: Y? No: \n      Position 1: L? That would be L, then position 2: Y? But we require position 2 to be L? → contradiction? \n   Because: we need position 2 to be L? So:\n      Position 1: first letter?\n      Position 2: L\n      Position 3: I\n      Position 4: N\n      Position 5: fifth?\n\nSo in ""LYING"": \n   L is at position 1 (first letter) → and then Y is at position 2? But we require the second letter to be L? So in ""LYING"", position 2 is Y? So it doesn\'t have L at position 2 → it has L at position 1? Therefore, it does not match? \n\nBut we know the word must have L at position 2? So our pattern: [unknown first] L I N [unknown fifth].\n\nTherefore, words must look like: X L I N Y.\n\nSo ""FLING"": \n   F at first: position1\n   L at position2 (fixed) → yes\n   I at position3 → yes\n   N at position4 → yes\n   G at fifth → yes\n\nSimilarly, ""SLING"": S L I N G → fits.\n\nAlso, ""ULNA"" is only four letters? Not five.\n\nAnother word: ""CLINK"" → C absent → invalid.\n\n""BLINS"" → B? But B absent → invalid.\n\nNow, what about ""FLIGHT""? Too long? Only five letters.\n\nAnother possibility: ""DAVEN"" → D-A-V-E-N → includes A and E? Absent → invalid.\n\nSo we have at least two candidates:\n  ""FLING"" and ""SLING""\n\nAlso, are there more? \n\n  ""GLINT"": G-L-I-N-T? But T is absent → invalid.\n  ""ELAND"": E? absent → invalid.\n  ""QUEEN"": Q? and E? → invalid.\n\nAnother: ""OLIVE"" → O absent? and doesn\'t match pattern? Second letter must be L? Does ""OLIVE"" have L at second? O-L-I-V-E → yes? But O is absent? → invalid.\n\nTherefore: FLING and SLING are strong candidates.\n\nBut note: we haven\'t tested F, S, G? But we can choose one? \n\nWe need to pick one to guess? \n\nWe are on the fourth guess? Total guesses are 6? So we can try one? \n\nBut note: if we guess one? And it\'s incorrect? We eliminate? \n\nBut then we guess the other? We might win with two guesses? But we have three guesses left? \n\nAlternatively, consider words that use new letters? \n\nBut we don\'t have much constraints? \n\nWe can also consider: the word could have duplicate letters? But so far: all letters we know (L,I,N) are distinct? So probably the first and fifth are distinct? \n\nBut we don\'t know? \n\nBoth candidates have the fifth letter G? So if we guess and it becomes ✓? Then we know? \n\nBut actually: \n   ""FLING"" has F at first and G at fifth.\n   ""SLING"" has S at first and G at fifth.\n\nSo the difference is first letter: F vs S? \n\nWe haven\'t eliminated F or S? \n\nSo we choose one? \n\nWe want to maximize information? \n\nAlternatively, we can pick a word that uses a letter not G? For example, if we want to test more letters? But both candidates have G? \n\nBut note: we are forced to use the pattern? So we have to choose a word that matches ? L I N ?\n\nIf we choose a word that doesn\'t have G? Then we test another letter? \n\nLet me search for words that match ? L I N ?\n\nOther than FLING and SLING? \n\nPossible:\n   ""MLINE"" → M? and E? E is absent → invalid.\n   ""ULNAR"" → U-L-N-A-R? But second letter? U-L: L is second? Then position 3: N? But we need I? So U-L-N? Not I → invalid.\n   ""ALIGN"" has A (absent).\n   ""ELINT"" has E (absent).\n   ""FLINT"" has T (absent).\n   ""SLINK"" → S-L-I-N-K? But K is absent (from ""blink"": K(x)) → invalid.\n   ""SLIMY"" → S-L-I-M-Y? Positions: S(1), L(2), I(3), M(4) → but we need N at fourth → invalid.\n\nAnother possibility: ""QUALM"" → but no I? → no.\n\nSo really? Only FLING and SLING? \n\nWait: but ""SLING"" and ""FLING"" are both valid? \n\nNow, we can choose one? And then if it fails? We adjust? \n\nWe have two letters to test: at first: F or S? And fifth: G? \n\nIf we guess ""SLING"":\n\n  If correct: win.\n  If not: then the word must be ""FLING""?\n\nBecause there are no other candidates? Or are there?\n\nWhat about ""GLIST""? G-L-I-S-T? But T absent → invalid.\n\n""SLICE"" → E? absent → invalid.\n\nSo really only two? \n\nTherefore, we can pick one? \n\nBut we must choose an English word? \n\nSo let me choose ""SLING"" because S is more common? \n\nBut F and S both common? \n\nAlternatively? We might pick ""FLING""? \n\nBut I\'ll choose ""SLING"" because I feel like it? \n\nBut then the fifth letter is G? So if we get:\n\n    S(?) L(✓) I(✓) N(✓) G(?)\n\nHow about G? It could be ""x"" if not? But in ""FLING"", G is at fifth? So if G is correct? Then only the first matters? \n\nBut note: if we guess ""SLING"" and the word is ""FLING"", then:\n\n   S(x) ? because S is not in the word? So S will get x? and L(✓), I(✓), N(✓), G(✓)? because G is at fifth? But then we get S(x) and G(✓)? \n\nTherefore, we can deduce the first letter? \n\nBut we don\'t know the first letter? \n\nTherefore, we guess ""SLING"": \n\n   If feedback: \n      S -> ? (it could be ✓ or x or -? But in this case? For ""FLING"": S is not present? So x)\n      L -> ✓\n      I -> ✓\n      N -> ✓\n      G -> ✓\n\n   So if the fifth letter is G? Then we get ✓ for G? \n\n   Then if S is x? Then the word must be ""FLING""? \n\n   Alternatively, if the fifth letter is something else? Then both words? But we don\'t have? \n\n   But wait: we don\'t have other words? \n\nTherefore, if we guess ""SLING"" and get:\n\n   - First letter feedback:\n          ✓: then win? because S at first? So SLING?\n          x: then FLING?\n\n   And fifth: G? ✓? because in both candidates? \n\nBut wait: both ""FLING"" and ""SLING"" have G at fifth? So we expect G to be ✓? \n\nTherefore, we can guess ""SLING""? And then if S is ✓? win? If S is x? then FLING? \n\nBut we have a problem? What if the fifth letter isn\'t G? Then we have missed? \n\nBut we thought there were only FLING and SLING? So fifth letter must be G? \n\nBecause we assumed? \n\nBut what else? \n\nLet me double-check? \n\nWe have pattern: ? L I N ? \n\nPossible words? We found:\n  FLING, SLING\n\nAre there others?\n\nLet\'s expand:\n\n  Words: \n    - F L I N G \n    - S L I N G \n\nBut what about? \n\n  ""GUILD"" → G-U-I-L-D → second letter U? not L? no.\n\n  ""BRINS"" → B absent? R absent → invalid.\n\n  ""AHIND"" → A absent? and E? absent → invalid.\n\n  ""YELLN"" → Y-E-L-L-N → E absent and not five letters? \n\nWait: we must have five letters? \n\nAnother: perhaps ""WELSH"" → W-E-L-S-H → E absent → invalid.\n\nOr ""ZYLON"" → Z-Y-L-O-N → O absent → invalid.\n\nI think we are safe: only FLING and SLING? \n\nSo we choose ""SLING"" as a guess? \n\nThen we get: \n   S for the first letter? if it is ✓? then SLING? \n   else? then FLING? \n\nSo we guess ""SLING""\n\nBut note: the fifth letter? In both cases? In FLING? G at fifth? so in ""SLING"" guess? G at fifth? So we get ✓ for G? \n\nTherefore, if S is ✓? we win? \nIf S is x? then we know the word has F at first? and then fifth letter G? so we guess FLING next? \n\nWe have three guesses left? Enough.\n\nSo let\'s guess ""SLING""\n\nHowever, if the word is not either? then we have a problem? But we think it\'s unlikely? \n\nBut in standard Wordle? We should choose valid words? \n\nTherefore:\n\n<guess>sling</guess> \n\nBut note: we are guessing a word? So we output SLING? \n\nBut let me confirm: \n\n   ""SLING"" matches the pattern: S (first), L(second) -> must be L? and then I? N? and then G? \n\n   And avoids all absent letters? Yes: S, L, I, N, G? and L, I, N are known? So we test S and G? \n\nYes.Based on the previous feedback:\n\n- **C, R, A, E, P, O, T, B, K** are **absent**.\n- **Position 2 is L**, **position 3 is I**, and **position 4 is N**.\n- The secret word pattern is: **`[?] L I N [?]`**.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Fixed Positions**:  \n   - The second letter must be **L** (from Guess 3: `blink` → L(✓)).  \n   - The third letter must be **I** (from Guess 2: `point` → I(✓)).  \n   - The fourth letter must be **N** (from Guess 1: `crane` → N(✓)).  \n\n2. **Absent Letters**:  \n   - Eliminated letters: **C, R, A, E, P, O, T, B, K**.  \n   - Valid letters for positions 1 and 5 are **D, F, G, H, J, M, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.  \n\n3. **Possible Words**:  \n   - Words must match the pattern `[?] L I N [?]`.  \n   - Common valid English candidates:  \n     - **`FLING`** (F at position 1, G at position 5) → Tests **F** and **G**.  \n     - **`SLING`** (S at position 1, G at position 5) → Tests **S** and **G**.  \n   - Both are high-frequency words fitting the pattern.  \n\n4. **Selection Strategy**:  \n   - Prioritize coverage of new letters. **S** is a highly common untested letter (more frequent than F).  \n   - Guessing **`SLING`** maximizes information:\n     - If **S** is correct (✓), the word is **`SLING`**.  \n     - If **S** is absent (x), the word is likely **`FLING`**.  \n   - **G** is shared in both candidates, so its feedback (likely ✓) is less diagnostic.  \n\n5. **Final Choice**:  \n   - **`SLING`** narrows down the solution efficiently with minimal risk, leveraging common letters.  \n\n### Next Guess:\n- Guessing **`SLING`** tests **S** at position 1 and **G** at position 5, while confirming fixed positions (L, I, N).\n\n<guess>sling</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(✓) N(✓) T(x)\nGuess 3: blink -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(✓) I(✓) N(✓) K(x)\nGuess 4: sling -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(✓) I(✓) N(✓) G(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from four guesses:

1. ""crane"": C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
2. ""point"": P(x) O(x) I(✓) N(✓) T(x)
3. ""blink"": B(x) L(✓) I(✓) N(✓) K(x)
4. ""sling"": S(x) L(✓) I(✓) N(✓) G(✓)

From the feedback:

- **Fixed positions**:
  - Position 3: I (from guess 2 and confirmed in guess 3 and 4)
  - Position 4: N (from guess 1 and confirmed)
  - Position 2: L (from guess 3 and confirmed in guess 4)

- **Additional correct in position**:
  - In guess 4 (""sling""): G is marked as ✓ and is in position 5? 
    But note: in ""sling"", the letters are: 
      S (1), L (2), I (3), N (4), G (5)
    Feedback: S(x) L(✓) I(✓) N(✓) G(✓)
    So G is at position 5 and is correct? Hence, position 5 is G.

Therefore, the secret word has:
  - Position 2: L
  - Position 3: I
  - Position 4: N
  - Position 5: G

And only the first position is unknown.

So the word is: ? L I N G

But we also know from the feedback that:
- S is absent (from guess 4: S(x))
- Also absent: C, R, A, E, P, O, T, B, K (from previous guesses)

Therefore, the absent letters are: C, R, A, E, P, O, T, B, K, S

We need to find a letter for the first position that:
- Is not one of the absent letters: so avoid C,R,A,E,P,O,T,B,K,S
- Forms a valid English word: _ L I N G

Possible letters for the first position? 
  Remaining: D, F, G, H, J, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: G is already used at the end? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? However, in previous feedback? We haven't seen duplicate. Also, G is in position 5? So the first letter can be G? But then the word would be ""GLING""? Not a word? 

So let's find words of the form: ? L I N G

Common words: 
  ""FLING"" -> F-L-I-N-G: F not absent? F is not in the absent list? 
      Absent list: C,R,A,E,P,O,T,B,K,S -> F is not in there? So valid.

  ""SLING"" was guessed? But we got S(x) and then also we know now position5=G? But we guessed ""sling"" and G was correct? But S was absent? So ""sling"" itself is not the secret word? Because we got S(x).

Therefore, F must be the first letter? Since ""FLING"" is the only common word? And F is not absent.

Check if there are others? 
  ""ALING"" -> A absent? invalid
  ""BLING"" -> B? absent -> invalid
  ""CLING"" -> C absent -> invalid
  ""ELING"" -> E? absent -> invalid
  ""GLING"" -> is it a word? Not really? 
  ""HLING"" -> not a word
  ""ILING"" -> I at first? but then the word would be ""ILING""? which isn't standard? 
  ""MLING"" -> not a word
  ""QLING"" -> not a word
  ""ULING"" -> not a word
  ""XLING"" -> not a word
  ""YLING"" -> not a word
  ""ZLING"" -> not a word

Therefore, the only common word is ""FLING"".

So we should guess ""FLING"".

But note: in previous guess ""sling"", we got G(✓) so the fifth letter is certainly G? 

And the pattern ? L I N G? 

Therefore, ""FLING"" must be the word.

So we output ""FLING"".

But let me double-check: 
  F is not in the absent letters? No? So allowed? 
  And we haven't tested F? But we don't need feedback? Because if this guess is correct? We get all ✓? 

Yes.

Thus: we guess ""FLING"".

### Analysis of Feedback:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**:  
  ✔️ N in position 4.  
  ❌ C, R, A, E absent.  
- **Guess 2 (point)**:  
  ✔️ I in position 3, N in position 4.  
  ❌ P, O, T absent.  
- **Guess 3 (blink)**:  
  ✔️ L in position 2, I in position 3, N in position 4.  
  ❌ B, K absent.  
- **Guess 4 (sling)**:  
  ✔️ L in position 2, I in position 3, N in position 4, **G in position 5**.  
  ❌ S absent.  

### Key Conclusions:
1. **Fixed Positions**:  
   - Position 2: **L**  
   - Position 3: **I**  
   - Position 4: **N**  
   - Position 5: **G**.  
2. **Secret Word Pattern**: `[?] L I N G`.  
3. **Absent Letters**: C, R, A, E, P, O, T, B, K, S (12 letters eliminated).  
4. **Remaining Letter for Position 1**: Any letter not in absent set (e.g., D, F, H, M, U, V, W, Y).  

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
- The secret word is **`_ L I N G`**, with only position 1 unknown.  
- The **only common English word** fitting this pattern is **`FLING`**:  
  - F is **not absent** and untested.  
  - Other combinations (e.g., ""HLING"", ""YLING"") are invalid words.  
- If ""FLING"" is incorrect, no other valid words match the pattern, but ""FLING"" is highly probable.  
- Since we have 2 guesses left, ""FLING"" resolves the game:  
  - ✔️ If correct, win.  
  - ❌ If wrong, reassess (unlikely).

  - Position 5: G

And only the first position is unknown.

So the word is: ? L I N G

But we also know from the feedback that:
- S is absent (from guess 4: S(x))
- Also absent: C, R, A, E, P, O, T, B, K (from previous guesses)

Therefore, the absent letters are: C, R, A, E, P, O, T, B, K, S

We need to find a letter for the first position that:
- Is not one of the absent letters: so avoid C,R,A,E,P,O,T,B,K,S
- Forms a valid English word: _ L I N G

Possible letters for the first position? 
  Remaining: D, F, G, H, J, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

So let's find words of the form: ? L I N G

Common words: 
  ""FLING"" -> F-L-I-N-G: F not absent? F is not in the absent list? 
      Absent list: C,R,A,E,P,O,T,B,K,S -> F is not in there? So valid.

  ""SLING"" was guessed? But we got S(x) and then also we know now position5=G? But we guessed ""sling"" and G was correct? But S was absent? So ""sling"" itself is not the secret word? Because we got S(x).

Therefore, F must be the first letter? Since ""FLING"" is the only common word? And F is not absent.

Check if there are others? 
  ""ALING"" -> A absent? invalid

  ""YLING"" -> not a word

Therefore, the only common word is ""FLING"".

So we should guess ""FLING"".

But note: in previous guess ""sling"", we got G(✓) so the fifth letter is certainly G? 

And the pattern ? L I N G? 

Therefore, ""FLING"" must be the word.
