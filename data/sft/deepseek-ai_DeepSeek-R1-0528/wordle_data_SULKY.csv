We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and no repeated letters to maximize information.
 Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.).

 One popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). 
 Another is ""SLATE"". Let me choose ""CRANE"" for this first guess.

 So, my first guess is: CRANE

We are given feedback that for ""crane"": all letters C, R, A, N, E are marked 'x' meaning none of these letters are in the secret word.

This tells us that the secret word does not contain any of the letters: C, R, A, N, E.

Since we have eliminated these letters, we need to choose a new guess that uses different letters.

We should try to cover other common letters. The remaining common letters might include: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, M, etc.

A good starting word for the second guess (without C, R, A, N, E) could be ""SLOTH"" because it has S, L, O, T, H — all common letters. However, let's consider:

Another option is ""TOILS"". But perhaps we can try a word with more common letters.

Let me list available letters: We have eliminated C, R, A, N, E. So available consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z and vowels: I, O, U.

Common vowels left: O, I, U.

Common consonants: S, T, L, D, H, M, P, B, etc.

A popular choice might be ""MOIST"" — but it has M, O, I, S, T. This covers lots of common letters.

Another option is ""BUMPY"" — but Y is less common and we have double letters? Not ideal since we want distinct letters.

We have 6 tries and we want to maximize information. Since the word could start with any of the remaining letters, let's choose a word that uses letters that are still possible.

But note, we must avoid C,R,A,N,E.

I suggest using ""MOIST"" because it has:
M, O, I, S, T — all high frequency letters that we haven't tried.

Alternatively, ""SHOUT"": S, H, O, U, T — covers common letters including vowel U and O.

But ""MOIST"" is a valid word and has two vowels (O, I) and three consonants.

Let me decide on ""MOIST"".

After the first guess ""crane"" with all letters marked as 'x', we know that the secret word contains none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E. Therefore, the new guess should avoid these letters and focus on other common English letters to maximize information gain. 

Common letters not yet tested include S, T, L, O, I, M, H, D, P, and U. A strong second guess would prioritize high-frequency letters and a balanced mix of vowels and consonants. The word ""MOIST"" fits well, as it uses S, T, O, I, and M—all common letters that frequently appear in 5-letter words. 

This guess will help identify:
- Whether any of S, T, O, I, or M are present.
- If present, whether they are in the correct position.

We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). So the secret word has none of these letters.
2. ""moist"" -> M(x), O(x), I(x), S(-), T(x). This means:
   - S is present in the word but not in the correct position (since it's marked with -).
   - M, O, I, T are absent.

From this, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter S, but not in the 4th position (since in ""moist"", S is the 4th letter and it's marked as wrong position).
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, S, T. So the available letters are:
Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels: U (since A, E, I, O are out)

But note: the word must have an S, and S is already known to be present.

Also, the word is 5 letters, and we know S is in it but not in the 4th position.

We need to form a 5-letter word that includes S and avoids the forbidden letters.

Available vowels: only U (since A, E, I, O are eliminated). But note: Y can sometimes act as a vowel. So we have U and Y as possible vowels.

We must include S and it cannot be in the 4th position.

Let's think of words that have S and use the available letters.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, U, Y, etc.

We should try to cover more common letters to get information.

Possible words:
- ""SUSHI"": but has H and I? Wait, I is eliminated (from ""moist"" feedback: I is absent). So I cannot be used.
- ""SHULS"": not a common word.
- ""PULPS"": has P, U, L, P, S. But P is available, and U, L. However, double P? Not ideal for information.

We need to avoid: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T.

So available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. And S must be included.

Since S is present and not in the 4th position, it can be in positions 1,2,3, or 5.

We should try a word that has S in a different position and uses other common letters.

Common letters from the available set: L, U, D, H, P, Y, B, G, K.

Let's try to form a word with S and without the forbidden letters.

Possible words:
- ""SULKS"": but K and S are available? But note: we have two S's? The word ""sulks"" has two S's. But we don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters. However, to maximize information, we should avoid duplicates if possible.

But we have to use S at least once.

Another word: ""PLUSH"" - P, L, U, S, H. This uses P, L, U, S, H. All available letters. And S is in the 4th position? But in ""moist"", S was in the 4th position and we were told it's present but wrong position. So in the secret word, S is not in the 4th position. Therefore, we cannot put S in the 4th position again. So ""plush"" has S in the 4th position, which we know is not correct. So we should avoid that.

We need a word that has S not in the 4th position.

Possible positions for S: 1,2,3,5.

Let's think of words with S in position 1, for example.

- ""SURLY"": but U is available, R is eliminated? R is in the forbidden list (from ""crane"": R is absent). So R cannot be used. ""Surly"" has R -> invalid.

- ""SULKY"": S, U, L, K, Y. All letters available? S (position1), U(2), L(3), K(4), Y(5). This avoids the forbidden letters. And S is in position 1, which is allowed because we don't know if it's correct or not, but we are testing.

But note: we have to make sure it's a valid word. ""Sulky"" is a valid word.

Another option: ""SHYLY"" - but has Y twice and H. But S is in position1. However, double Y? And it might not be the best for information.

Another: ""SKULK"" - S, K, U, L, K. Has K twice? And S in position1.

But ""sulky"" seems good: uses S, U, L, K, Y. All new letters and common enough.

We could also consider S in position 2 or 3 or 5.

For example, words with S in position 2:
- ""USUAL"" - but U, S, U, A, L. A is eliminated (from ""crane""). So invalid.

- ""PSYCH"" - not 5 letters? ""Psych"" is 5? P-S-Y-C-H. But C is eliminated. So invalid.

- ""ASHEN"" - but A and E are eliminated.

Hard to find words with S in position 2 without forbidden letters.

Position 3: 
- ""BUSKS"" - B, U, S, K, S. But has two S's and S in position 3 and 5. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, S in position 3 is new.

But ""busks"" is a word? Yes, but let's see if we can avoid duplicates.

- ""DUSTS"" - D, U, S, T, S. T is eliminated (from ""moist"": T is absent). So invalid.

Position 5: 
- ""FOCUS"" - but F, O, C, U, S. O and C are eliminated.

- ""PIOUS"" - P, I, O, U, S. I and O are eliminated.

So it's challenging. 

Therefore, ""sulky"" seems a reasonable choice: S (position1), U (vowel), L, K, Y. All new letters and S is not in the 4th position.

We might also consider ""shuln"" but that's not a word.

Another word: ""LYMES"" - but E is eliminated.

Or ""PUDGY"" - no S.

We must include S.

Another option: ""BUGS"" - too short.

""BULKS"" - B, U, L, K, S. S in position 5. This is a valid word. And it uses B, U, L, K, S. All available. And S is in position 5, which is different from the 4th.

Similarly, ""SULKS"" - S, U, L, K, S. S in position1 and 5. But duplicate S. We don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters, so it might be acceptable, but to maximize information, it's better to have all distinct letters if possible.

""BULKS"" has distinct letters: B, U, L, K, S. And S is at the end.

So ""bulks"" is a good candidate.

Similarly, ""HULKS"" - H, U, L, K, S. Also distinct.

But we don't know if H is in the word, so we can try.

Between ""sulky"" and ""bulks"", both are valid.

""sulky"" has Y, which is less common, but it's a vowel substitute.

""bulks"" uses B, U, L, K, S.

We might also consider ""PLUMB"" but no S.

Given that, let's choose ""bulks"" because it has S in position 5, which we haven't tested, and it uses common consonants.

But note: we have to avoid the 4th position for S? No, we only know that in the secret word, S is not in the 4th position. But we can put S in any position in our guess to test. However, if we put S in the 4th position again, we already know it's not correct, so it would be a waste of a position. Therefore, we should avoid putting S in the 4th position in our next guess.

In ""bulks"", S is in position 5, so that's fine.

Similarly, in ""sulky"", S is in position 1.

Both are acceptable.

I think ""bulks"" is a good choice because it uses B, U, L, K, S, all distinct and common.

But let's check if there are other words.

""SHULS"" - not common.

""SKULK"" - duplicate K.

So I'll go with ""bulks"".

But we have to make sure it's a valid word. Yes, ""bulks"" is a valid English word.

Therefore, our next guess is ""bulks"".

We can also consider ""hulks"" or ""pulks"", but ""bulks"" is fine.

So guess: bulks

But note: we are trying to find the secret word, and we know it has S, so we are including S.

After this guess, we will get feedback on B, U, L, K, S.

We hope to get more information.

So, the guess is ""bulks"".
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:
- ""crane"" had all letters (C, R, A, N, E) marked as absent (x), so these letters are not in the secret word.
- ""moist"" had M, O, I, and T marked as absent (x), and S marked as present but in the wrong position (-). This means:
  - The secret word contains the letter S, but not in the 4th position.
  - The letters M, O, I, and T are not in the secret word.

Combined, the eliminated letters are: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T. The secret word must include S (not in position 4) and avoid all eliminated letters.

For the next guess:
- The word must include S in a position other than 4 (positions 1, 2, 3, or 5).
- To maximize information, prioritize common unused letters from the available set (B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.) and avoid duplicates.
- ""bulks"" is a valid 5-letter word that fits these criteria:
  - Contains S in position 5 (a new position to test).
  - Uses new common letters: B, U, L, K (all untested).
  - Avoids eliminated letters and positions.

This guess will help identify:
- If B, U, L, or K are present and in what positions.
- If S is confirmed in position 5 or if it moves (providing more positional data).

<guess>bulks</guess>",bulks,"We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). So the secret word has none of these letters.
2. ""moist"" -> M(x), O(x), I(x), S(-), T(x). This means:
   - S is present in the word but not in the correct position (since it's marked with -).
   - M, O, I, T are absent.

From this, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter S, but not in the 4th position (since in ""moist"", S is the 4th letter and it's marked as wrong position).
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, S, T. So the available letters are:
Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels: U (since A, E, I, O are out)

But note: the word must have an S, and S is already known to be present.

Also, the word is 5 letters, and we know S is in it but not in the 4th position.

We need to form a 5-letter word that includes S and avoids the forbidden letters.

Available vowels: only U (since A, E, I, O are eliminated). But note: Y can sometimes act as a vowel. So we have U and Y as possible vowels.

We must include S and it cannot be in the 4th position.

Let's think of words that have S and use the available letters.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, U, Y, etc.

We should try to cover more common letters to get information.

Possible words:
- ""SUSHI"": but has H and I? Wait, I is eliminated (from ""moist"" feedback: I is absent). So I cannot be used.
- ""SHULS"": not a common word.
- ""PULPS"": has P, U, L, P, S. But P is available, and U, L. However, double P? Not ideal for information.

We need to avoid: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T.

So available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. And S must be included.

Since S is present and not in the 4th position, it can be in positions 1,2,3, or 5.

We should try a word that has S in a different position and uses other common letters.

Common letters from the available set: L, U, D, H, P, Y, B, G, K.

Let's try to form a word with S and without the forbidden letters.

Possible words:
- ""SULKS"": but K and S are available? But note: we have two S's? The word ""sulks"" has two S's. But we don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters. However, to maximize information, we should avoid duplicates if possible.

But we have to use S at least once.

Another word: ""PLUSH"" - P, L, U, S, H. This uses P, L, U, S, H. All available letters. And S is in the 4th position? But in ""moist"", S was in the 4th position and we were told it's present but wrong position. So in the secret word, S is not in the 4th position. Therefore, we cannot put S in the 4th position again. So ""plush"" has S in the 4th position, which we know is not correct. So we should avoid that.

We need a word that has S not in the 4th position.

Possible positions for S: 1,2,3,5.

Let's think of words with S in position 1, for example.

- ""SURLY"": but U is available, R is eliminated? R is in the forbidden list (from ""crane"": R is absent). So R cannot be used. ""Surly"" has R -> invalid.

- ""SULKY"": S, U, L, K, Y. All letters available? S (position1), U(2), L(3), K(4), Y(5). This avoids the forbidden letters. And S is in position 1, which is allowed because we don't know if it's correct or not, but we are testing.

But note: we have to make sure it's a valid word. ""Sulky"" is a valid word.

Another option: ""SHYLY"" - but has Y twice and H. But S is in position1. However, double Y? And it might not be the best for information.

Another: ""SKULK"" - S, K, U, L, K. Has K twice? And S in position1.

But ""sulky"" seems good: uses S, U, L, K, Y. All new letters and common enough.

We could also consider S in position 2 or 3 or 5.

For example, words with S in position 2:
- ""USUAL"" - but U, S, U, A, L. A is eliminated (from ""crane""). So invalid.

- ""PSYCH"" - not 5 letters? ""Psych"" is 5? P-S-Y-C-H. But C is eliminated. So invalid.

- ""ASHEN"" - but A and E are eliminated.

Hard to find words with S in position 2 without forbidden letters.

Position 3: 
- ""BUSKS"" - B, U, S, K, S. But has two S's and S in position 3 and 5. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, S in position 3 is new.

But ""busks"" is a word? Yes, but let's see if we can avoid duplicates.

- ""DUSTS"" - D, U, S, T, S. T is eliminated (from ""moist"": T is absent). So invalid.

Position 5: 
- ""FOCUS"" - but F, O, C, U, S. O and C are eliminated.

- ""PIOUS"" - P, I, O, U, S. I and O are eliminated.

So it's challenging. 

Therefore, ""sulky"" seems a reasonable choice: S (position1), U (vowel), L, K, Y. All new letters and S is not in the 4th position.

We might also consider ""shuln"" but that's not a word.

Another word: ""LYMES"" - but E is eliminated.

Or ""PUDGY"" - no S.

We must include S.

Another option: ""BUGS"" - too short.

""BULKS"" - B, U, L, K, S. S in position 5. This is a valid word. And it uses B, U, L, K, S. All available. And S is in position 5, which is different from the 4th.

Similarly, ""SULKS"" - S, U, L, K, S. S in position1 and 5. But duplicate S. We don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters, so it might be acceptable, but to maximize information, it's better to have all distinct letters if possible.

""BULKS"" has distinct letters: B, U, L, K, S. And S is at the end.

So ""bulks"" is a good candidate.

Similarly, ""HULKS"" - H, U, L, K, S. Also distinct.

But we don't know if H is in the word, so we can try.

Between ""sulky"" and ""bulks"", both are valid.

""sulky"" has Y, which is less common, but it's a vowel substitute.

""bulks"" uses B, U, L, K, S.

We might also consider ""PLUMB"" but no S.

Given that, let's choose ""bulks"" because it has S in position 5, which we haven't tested, and it uses common consonants.

But note: we have to avoid the 4th position for S? No, we only know that in the secret word, S is not in the 4th position. But we can put S in any position in our guess to test. However, if we put S in the 4th position again, we already know it's not correct, so it would be a waste of a position. Therefore, we should avoid putting S in the 4th position in our next guess.

In ""bulks"", S is in position 5, so that's fine.

Similarly, in ""sulky"", S is in position 1.

Both are acceptable.

I think ""bulks"" is a good choice because it uses B, U, L, K, S, all distinct and common.

But let's check if there are other words.

""SHULS"" - not common.

""SKULK"" - duplicate K.

So I'll go with ""bulks"".

But we have to make sure it's a valid word. Yes, ""bulks"" is a valid English word.

Therefore, our next guess is ""bulks"".

We can also consider ""hulks"" or ""pulks"", but ""bulks"" is fine.

So guess: bulks

But note: we are trying to find the secret word, and we know it has S, so we are including S.

After this guess, we will get feedback on B, U, L, K, S.

We hope to get more information.

So, the guess is ""bulks"".Based on the previous feedback:
- ""crane"" had all letters (C, R, A, N, E) marked as absent (x), so these letters are not in the secret word.
- ""moist"" had M, O, I, and T marked as absent (x), and S marked as present but in the wrong position (-). This means:
  - The secret word contains the letter S, but not in the 4th position.
  - The letters M, O, I, and T are not in the secret word.

Combined, the eliminated letters are: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T. The secret word must include S (not in position 4) and avoid all eliminated letters.

For the next guess:
- The word must include S in a position other than 4 (positions 1, 2, 3, or 5).
- To maximize information, prioritize common unused letters from the available set (B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.) and avoid duplicates.

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,SULKY,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and no repeated letters to maximize information.
 Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.).

 One popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). 
 Another is ""SLATE"". Let me choose ""CRANE"" for this first guess.

 So, my first guess is: CRANE

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback that for ""crane"": all letters C, R, A, N, E are marked 'x' meaning none of these letters are in the secret word.

This tells us that the secret word does not contain any of the letters: C, R, A, N, E.

Since we have eliminated these letters, we need to choose a new guess that uses different letters.

We should try to cover other common letters. The remaining common letters might include: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, M, etc.

A good starting word for the second guess (without C, R, A, N, E) could be ""SLOTH"" because it has S, L, O, T, H — all common letters. However, let's consider:

Alternative: ""PIOUS"" — but P, I, O, U, S. U is also common.

Another option is ""TOILS"". But perhaps we can try a word with more common letters.

Let me list available letters: We have eliminated C, R, A, N, E. So available consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z and vowels: I, O, U.

Common vowels left: O, I, U.

Common consonants: S, T, L, D, H, M, P, B, etc.

A popular choice might be ""MOIST"" — but it has M, O, I, S, T. This covers lots of common letters.

Another option is ""BUMPY"" — but Y is less common and we have double letters? Not ideal since we want distinct letters.

We have 6 tries and we want to maximize information. Since the word could start with any of the remaining letters, let's choose a word that uses letters that are still possible.

But note, we must avoid C,R,A,N,E.

I suggest using ""MOIST"" because it has:
M, O, I, S, T — all high frequency letters that we haven't tried.

Alternatively, ""SHOUT"": S, H, O, U, T — covers common letters including vowel U and O.

But ""MOIST"" is a valid word and has two vowels (O, I) and three consonants.

Let me decide on ""MOIST"".

Guess: MOIST

We'll see what feedback we get.After the first guess ""crane"" with all letters marked as 'x', we know that the secret word contains none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E. Therefore, the new guess should avoid these letters and focus on other common English letters to maximize information gain. 

Common letters not yet tested include S, T, L, O, I, M, H, D, P, and U. A strong second guess would prioritize high-frequency letters and a balanced mix of vowels and consonants. The word ""MOIST"" fits well, as it uses S, T, O, I, and M—all common letters that frequently appear in 5-letter words. 

This guess will help identify:
- Whether any of S, T, O, I, or M are present.
- If present, whether they are in the correct position.

<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). So the secret word has none of these letters.
2. ""moist"" -> M(x), O(x), I(x), S(-), T(x). This means:
   - S is present in the word but not in the correct position (since it's marked with -).
   - M, O, I, T are absent.

From this, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter S, but not in the 4th position (since in ""moist"", S is the 4th letter and it's marked as wrong position).
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, S, T. So the available letters are:
Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: the word must have an S, and S is already known to be present.

So available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. And S must be included.

Since S is present and not in the 4th position, it can be in positions 1,2,3, or 5.

We should try a word that has S in a different position and uses other common letters.

Common letters from the available set: L, U, D, H, P, Y, B, G, K.

Let's try to form a word with S and without the forbidden letters.

Possible words:
- ""SULKS"": but K and S are available? But note: we have two S's? The word ""sulks"" has two S's. But we don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters. However, to maximize information, we should avoid duplicates if possible.

But we have to use S at least once.

Another word: ""PLUSH"" - P, L, U, S, H. This uses P, L, U, S, H. All available letters. And S is in the 4th position? But in ""moist"", S was in the 4th position and we were told it's present but wrong position. So in the secret word, S is not in the 4th position. Therefore, we cannot put S in the 4th position again. So ""plush"" has S in the 4th position, which we know is not correct. So we should avoid that.

We need a word that has S not in the 4th position.

Possible positions for S: 1,2,3,5.

Let's think of words with S in position 1, for example.

- ""SURLY"": but U is available, R is eliminated? R is in the forbidden list (from ""crane"": R is absent). So R cannot be used. ""Surly"" has R -> invalid.

- ""SULKY"": S, U, L, K, Y. All letters available? S (position1), U(2), L(3), K(4), Y(5). This avoids the forbidden letters. And S is in position 1, which is allowed because we don't know if it's correct or not, but we are testing.

But note: we have to make sure it's a valid word. ""Sulky"" is a valid word.

Another option: ""SHYLY"" - but has Y twice and H. But S is in position1. However, double Y? And it might not be the best for information.

Another: ""SKULK"" - S, K, U, L, K. Has K twice? And S in position1.

But ""sulky"" seems good: uses S, U, L, K, Y. All new letters and common enough.

We could also consider S in position 2 or 3 or 5.

For example, words with S in position 2:
- ""USUAL"" - but U, S, U, A, L. A is eliminated (from ""crane""). So invalid.

- ""PSYCH"" - not 5 letters? ""Psych"" is 5? P-S-Y-C-H. But C is eliminated. So invalid.

- ""ASHEN"" - but A and E are eliminated.

Hard to find words with S in position 2 without forbidden letters.

Position 3: 
- ""BUSKS"" - B, U, S, K, S. But has two S's and S in position 3 and 5. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, S in position 3 is new.

But ""busks"" is a word? Yes, but let's see if we can avoid duplicates.

- ""DUSTS"" - D, U, S, T, S. T is eliminated (from ""moist"": T is absent). So invalid.

Position 5: 
- ""FOCUS"" - but F, O, C, U, S. O and C are eliminated.

- ""PIOUS"" - P, I, O, U, S. I and O are eliminated.

So it's challenging. 

Therefore, ""sulky"" seems a reasonable choice: S (position1), U (vowel), L, K, Y. All new letters and S is not in the 4th position.

We might also consider ""shuln"" but that's not a word.

Another word: ""LYMES"" - but E is eliminated.

Or ""PUDGY"" - no S.

We must include S.

Another option: ""BUGS"" - too short.

""BULKS"" - B, U, L, K, S. S in position 5. This is a valid word. And it uses B, U, L, K, S. All available. And S is in position 5, which is different from the 4th.

Similarly, ""SULKS"" - S, U, L, K, S. S in position1 and 5. But duplicate S. We don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters, so it might be acceptable, but to maximize information, it's better to have all distinct letters if possible.

""BULKS"" has distinct letters: B, U, L, K, S. And S is at the end.

So ""bulks"" is a good candidate.

Similarly, ""HULKS"" - H, U, L, K, S. Also distinct.

But we don't know if H is in the word, so we can try.

Between ""sulky"" and ""bulks"", both are valid.

""sulky"" has Y, which is less common, but it's a vowel substitute.

""bulks"" uses B, U, L, K, S.

We might also consider ""PLUMB"" but no S.

Given that, let's choose ""bulks"" because it has S in position 5, which we haven't tested, and it uses common consonants.

But note: we have to avoid the 4th position for S? No, we only know that in the secret word, S is not in the 4th position. But we can put S in any position in our guess to test. However, if we put S in the 4th position again, we already know it's not correct, so it would be a waste of a position. Therefore, we should avoid putting S in the 4th position in our next guess.

In ""bulks"", S is in position 5, so that's fine.

Similarly, in ""sulky"", S is in position 1.

Both are acceptable.

I think ""bulks"" is a good choice because it uses B, U, L, K, S, all distinct and common.

But let's check if there are other words.

""SHULS"" - not common.

""SKULK"" - duplicate K.

So I'll go with ""bulks"".

But we have to make sure it's a valid word. Yes, ""bulks"" is a valid English word.

Therefore, our next guess is ""bulks"".

We can also consider ""hulks"" or ""pulks"", but ""bulks"" is fine.

So guess: bulks

But note: we are trying to find the secret word, and we know it has S, so we are including S.

After this guess, we will get feedback on B, U, L, K, S.

We hope to get more information.

So, the guess is ""bulks"".Based on the previous feedback:
- ""crane"" had all letters (C, R, A, N, E) marked as absent (x), so these letters are not in the secret word.
- ""moist"" had M, O, I, and T marked as absent (x), and S marked as present but in the wrong position (-). This means:
  - The secret word contains the letter S, but not in the 4th position.
  - The letters M, O, I, and T are not in the secret word.

Combined, the eliminated letters are: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T. The secret word must include S (not in position 4) and avoid all eliminated letters.

For the next guess:
- The word must include S in a position other than 4 (positions 1, 2, 3, or 5).
- To maximize information, prioritize common unused letters from the available set (B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.) and avoid duplicates.
- ""bulks"" is a valid 5-letter word that fits these criteria:
  - Contains S in position 5 (a new position to test).
  - Uses new common letters: B, U, L, K (all untested).
  - Avoids eliminated letters and positions.

This guess will help identify:
- If B, U, L, or K are present and in what positions.
- If S is confirmed in position 5 or if it moves (providing more positional data).

But note: we have two S\'s? The word ""sulks"" has two S\'s. But we don\'t know if the secret word has duplicate letters. However, to maximize information, we should avoid duplicates if possible.\n\nBut we have to use S at least once.\n\nAnother word: ""PLUSH"" - P, L, U, S, H. This uses P, L, U, S, H. All available letters. And S is in the 4th position? But in ""moist"", S was in the 4th position and we were told it\'s present but wrong position. So in the secret word, S is not in the 4th position. Therefore, we cannot put S in the 4th position again. So ""plush"" has S in the 4th position, which we know is not correct. So we should avoid that.\n\nWe need a word that has S not in the 4th position.\n\nPossible positions for S: 1,2,3,5.\n\nLet\'s think of words with S in position 1, for example.\n\n- ""SURLY"": but U is available, R is eliminated? R is in the forbidden list (from ""crane"": R is absent). So R cannot be used. ""Surly"" has R -> invalid.\n\n- ""SULKY"": S, U, L, K, Y. All letters available? S (position1), U(2), L(3), K(4), Y(5). This avoids the forbidden letters. And S is in position 1, which is allowed because we don\'t know if it\'s correct or not, but we are testing.\n\nBut note: we have to make sure it\'s a valid word. ""Sulky"" is a valid word.\n\nAnother option: ""SHYLY"" - but has Y twice and H. But S is in position1. However, double Y? And it might not be the best for information.\n\nAnother: ""SKULK"" - S, K, U, L, K. Has K twice? And S in position1.\n\nBut ""sulky"" seems good: uses S, U, L, K, Y. All new letters and common enough.\n\nWe could also consider S in position 2 or 3 or 5.\n\nFor example, words with S in position 2:\n- ""USUAL"" - but U, S, U, A, L. A is eliminated (from ""crane""). So invalid.\n\n- ""PSYCH"" - not 5 letters? ""Psych"" is 5? P-S-Y-C-H. But C is eliminated. So invalid.\n\n- ""ASHEN"" - but A and E are eliminated.\n\nHard to find words with S in position 2 without forbidden letters.\n\nPosition 3: \n- ""BUSKS"" - B, U, S, K, S. But has two S\'s and S in position 3 and 5. But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, S in position 3 is new.\n\nBut ""busks"" is a word? Yes, but let\'s see if we can avoid duplicates.\n\n- ""DUSTS"" - D, U, S, T, S. T is eliminated (from ""moist"": T is absent). So invalid.\n\nPosition 5: \n- ""FOCUS"" - but F, O, C, U, S. O and C are eliminated.\n\n- ""PIOUS"" - P, I, O, U, S. I and O are eliminated.\n\nSo it\'s challenging. \n\nTherefore, ""sulky"" seems a reasonable choice: S (position1), U (vowel), L, K, Y. All new letters and S is not in the 4th position.\n\nWe might also consider ""shuln"" but that\'s not a word.\n\nAnother word: ""LYMES"" - but E is eliminated.\n\nOr ""PUDGY"" - no S.\n\nWe must include S.\n\nAnother option: ""BUGS"" - too short.\n\n""BULKS"" - B, U, L, K, S. S in position 5. This is a valid word. And it uses B, U, L, K, S. All available. And S is in position 5, which is different from the 4th.\n\nSimilarly, ""SULKS"" - S, U, L, K, S. S in position1 and 5. But duplicate S. We don\'t know if the secret word has duplicate letters, so it might be acceptable, but to maximize information, it\'s better to have all distinct letters if possible.\n\n""BULKS"" has distinct letters: B, U, L, K, S. And S is at the end.\n\nSo ""bulks"" is a good candidate.\n\nSimilarly, ""HULKS"" - H, U, L, K, S. Also distinct.\n\nBut we don\'t know if H is in the word, so we can try.\n\nBetween ""sulky"" and ""bulks"", both are valid.\n\n""sulky"" has Y, which is less common, but it\'s a vowel substitute.\n\n""bulks"" uses B, U, L, K, S.\n\nWe might also consider ""PLUMB"" but no S.\n\nGiven that, let\'s choose ""bulks"" because it has S in position 5, which we haven\'t tested, and it uses common consonants.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the 4th position for S? No, we only know that in the secret word, S is not in the 4th position. But we can put S in any position in our guess to test. However, if we put S in the 4th position again, we already know it\'s not correct, so it would be a waste of a position. Therefore, we should avoid putting S in the 4th position in our next guess.\n\nIn ""bulks"", S is in position 5, so that\'s fine.\n\nSimilarly, in ""sulky"", S is in position 1.\n\nBoth are acceptable.\n\nI think ""bulks"" is a good choice because it uses B, U, L, K, S, all distinct and common.\n\nBut let\'s check if there are other words.\n\n""SHULS"" - not common.\n\n""SKULK"" - duplicate K.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""bulks"".\n\nBut we have to make sure it\'s a valid word. Yes, ""bulks"" is a valid English word.\n\nTherefore, our next guess is ""bulks"".\n\nWe can also consider ""hulks"" or ""pulks"", but ""bulks"" is fine.\n\nSo guess: bulks\n\nBut note: we are trying to find the secret word, and we know it has S, so we are including S.\n\nAfter this guess, we will get feedback on B, U, L, K, S.\n\nWe hope to get more information.\n\nSo, the guess is ""bulks"".Based on the previous feedback:\n- ""crane"" had all letters (C, R, A, N, E) marked as absent (x), so these letters are not in the secret word.\n- ""moist"" had M, O, I, and T marked as absent (x), and S marked as present but in the wrong position (-). This means:\n  - The secret word contains the letter S, but not in the 4th position.\n  - The letters M, O, I, and T are not in the secret word.\n\nCombined, the eliminated letters are: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T. The secret word must include S (not in position 4) and avoid all eliminated letters.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- The word must include S in a position other than 4 (positions 1, 2, 3, or 5).\n- To maximize information, prioritize common unused letters from the available set (B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.) and avoid duplicates.\n- ""bulks"" is a valid 5-letter word that fits these criteria:\n  - Contains S in position 5 (a new position to test).\n  - Uses new common letters: B, U, L, K (all untested).\n  - Avoids eliminated letters and positions.\n\nThis guess will help identify:\n- If B, U, L, or K are present and in what positions.\n- If S is confirmed in position 5 or if it moves (providing more positional data).\n\n<guess>bulks</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(x) S(-) T(x)\nGuess 3: bulks -> FEEDBACK: B(x) U(✓) L(✓) K(✓) S(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback for three guesses:

1. ""crane"" -> all letters absent: no C, R, A, N, E.
2. ""moist"" -> M, O, I, T absent; S present but not in position 4.
3. ""bulks"" -> B absent; U present and in correct position (position 2? Let's note that in ""bulks"": B-U-L-K-S, so U is the second letter, and it's marked correct. Also L and K are correct (positions 3 and 4), but S is present but wrong position (it was in position 5).

In ""bulks"":
- Position 1: B -> x (absent)
  Position 2: U -> ✓ (correct)
  Position 3: L -> ✓ (correct)
  Position 4: K -> ✓ (correct)
  Position 5: S -> - (present but wrong position)

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word has U in position 2, L in position 3, K in position 4.
- S is in the word but not in position 5 (and also not in position 4, from previous feedback).
- We have eliminated: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T, B.

So the secret word structure so far: _ U L K _

We know S is one of the letters but not in position 4 or 5. Therefore, it must be in position 1. Why? Because only position 1 is left. The word is 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5. We have fixed 2,3,4: U,L,K. Position 5 is not S (from feedback of bulks: S in pos5 gets -). Position 4 is fixed as K (so not S). The only position left for S is position 1.

Therefore, the secret word must be S U L K ??? But we know S is not in the word? No, we know S is present but not in pos4 or pos5. Since position 2,3,4 are fixed and not S (position2 is U, etc.), then S must be in position1.

But we need to fill position5. Also, we need to confirm if this is the case.

So possible secret words are of the form: S U L K ?

Constraints:
- The word must contain S (which we are now assuming is in position1).
- The last letter (position5) must be a letter that hasn't been eliminated and is not S (since if S were in position5, it would have been marked correct, but it was marked - meaning it is present but not in that position).

In ""bulks"", S was in position5 and got -, so S is not in position5, which is consistent.

Now, what about position1? We haven't fixed it yet, but we know that S must appear somewhere. The only positions we haven't fixed are 1 and 5. We know position5 is not S. Position1 cannot be one of the eliminated letters. But we also know from the feedback on ""moist"" that S is present and not in pos4, and now from ""bulks"", not in pos5. Since pos2,3,4 are fixed, the only possibility is that S is in position1.

Therefore, let's assume the word is S U L K ?.

But we need to find the last letter.

Eliminated letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,T,B.

We also know the letter in position5 is not S, so it must be one of the remaining letters.

What letters are possible for position5?

Available letters: D, F, G, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z. And any that haven't been tested.

But note, we have tested: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,T,B,S,U,L,K. But U,L,K are in the word and fixed, so they don't affect the remaining position except we know S is also present (and we are putting it in pos1).

So position5: must be a letter that is not eliminated and not used in the word? No, it can be a new letter or even one of the letters we already know? But we know U,L,K,S are already used. The word must have exactly these letters? Not necessarily; we know S,U,L,K are present, but there might be a duplicate? For example, the last letter could be S? But we already know S cannot be in position5, and we think S is in position1, so a duplicate S? But in feedback from bulks, we only have one S marked as -, so if there were two S, we might see it? But in bulks, we had S only in position5, so if there is another S in position1, we would only get one '-' for the S in position5, and no indication for the S in position1 because we didn't guess that.

Wait, in guess 3, we guessed ""bulks"", which has no S in position1. We only guessed S in position5. The word we are thinking is S U L K ?, so if the secret word is S U L K S? Then when we guess ""bulks"", which is B U L K S, the feedback would be: B absent -> x, U correct -> ✓, L correct -> ✓, K correct -> ✓, S: we know S is present, but in ""bulks"" it's in position5. In the secret word, if it's S U L K S, then S is in both position1 and position5. So in our guess, we did not guess S in position1, so we get no credit for that. For position5, we guessed S, and it's present but not necessarily correct? If the secret is S U L K S, then position5 is S, so our guess of S in position5 should be ✓. But the feedback was '-', meaning wrong position. Therefore, the secret word cannot have S in position5. So if there is a duplicate S, our feedback would show two S's? Not necessarily; in the feedback system, it marks each instance. Since we only guessed one S (in position5), and if the secret has two, we would only get one symbol corresponding to that S. But importantly, if S were in position5 in the secret, then our S in position5 would be marked ✓, not '-'. So it's confirmed that S is not in position5.

Therefore, position5 must be a letter that is not S, and not eliminated.

And since we are assuming S is in position1, the word becomes: S U L K ?

What are possible words that start with ""SULK"" and end with one letter, that is not eliminated, and the word must be valid.

Possible words: SULK? -> SULKY is one, but Y is available? Yes.

But let's check: ""SULKY"" ends with Y.

Is there any other? ""SULKS"" would be S U L K S, but then position5 is S, which we just argued is not possible because if we guess ""SULKS"" now, but we haven't. However, from feedback, we know S is not in position5. So ""SULKS"" is invalid.

Other words? Let me think. There aren't many words that start with ""SULK"".

Possible: SULKY or SULKA? But sulka is not common; sulky is common.

But is ""SULKY"" valid? Yes.

We also have ""SULPH""? But P and H are available? But is it a word? ""Sulph"" is not standard; ""sulky"" is better.

Alternatively, ""BULKS"" we tried, but that's not starting with S.

So the only common word I can think of is ""SULKY"".

But let's confirm the letters: position1: S, position2: U, position3: L, position4: K, position5: Y.

We haven't eliminated Y. From the feedback so far, we only have eliminated letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,T,B. So Y is still possible.

Also, in the feedback for ""bulks"", the S was marked as '-' meaning present but wrong position. But if the secret is ""SULKY"", and we guessed ""bulks"" (B U L K S), then S is in the secret in position1, which we didn't guess. So in our guess, we had S in position5. Since position5 is not S in secret (secret position5 is Y), so S is present but not in position5, so '-' is correct. The S in position1 is not accounted for in the guess, which is fine because we didn't guess it in that position.

Therefore, we should guess ""SULKY"".

But we have one more thing: in the first guess, ""moist"" had S in position4 (which we now know is secret position4 is K, so S would be mismatched). And we were told S is present but not in position4, meaning S must be in the word elsewhere. In ""SULKY"", S is in position1, so consistent.

We haven't tested Y, but that's fine.

Therefore, our next guess should be ""SULKY"".

But what about double checking if there are other possibilities? Suppose the secret has S in position1, then position5 must be filled. Are there other possibilities besides ""SULKY""? ""SULKS"" doesn't work because secret must not have S in position5. Let me think: ""SULKA""? Doesn't seem standard. ""SULKA"" might be accepted in some dictionaries, but ""sulky"" is more common.

Another possibility: what if S is not in position1? We deduced S must be in position1 because positions 2,3,4 are fixed and not S, and position5 is not S. So unless there is another position? The word has only five positions. So yes, S must be in position1.

Therefore, the secret word is ""SULKY"" or perhaps ""SULCI"" but C is eliminated? Yes, C is eliminated. ""SULKED""? But it's 6 letters. So ""SULKY"" is a valid 5-letter word.

We can also think: we have U in position2, L in 3, K in 4; S must be somewhere else, so position1 is the only logical place.

Thus, we guess ""SULKY"".

But to be thorough, let's see the feedback: in ""bulks"", we have B(x) U(✓) L(✓) K(✓) S(-). So the last letter cannot be S, and must be one that doesn't conflict.

In ""SULKY"", position5 is Y. We haven't guessed Y before, so it might be Y.

Therefore, the guess is ""SULKY"".
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:
- Guess 1 (""crane""): Eliminated letters C, R, A, N, E (all absent).
- Guess 2 (""moist""): Eliminated letters M, O, I, T (all absent); S is present but not in position 4.
- Guess 3 (""bulks""): Eliminated letter B (absent); Cconfirmed positions: U in position 2, L in position 3, K in position 4; S is present but not in position 5.

### Deductions:
1. **Secret word structure**: Positions 2, 3, and 4 are fixed as U, L, K respectively: `[?] U L K [?]`.
2. **Position 1**: Must contain S. Why? 
   - S is confirmed present in Guess 2 and Guess 3.
   - S cannot be in position 4 (from Guess 2) or position 5 (from Guess 3).
   - Positions 2, 3, and 4 are fixed and not S.
   - Therefore, S must be in position 1.
3. **Position 5**: Must be a valid letter not eliminated and not S.
   - Eliminated letters (C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T, B) cannot be used.
   - Available letters include D, F, G, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
4. **Secret word**: With position 1 as S and positions 2, 3, 4 fixed as U, L, K, the word is `S U L K [?]`. The only common 5-letter word fitting this pattern is **""SULKY""** (meaning gloomy or sullen).
   - Position 5 = Y is untested and not eliminated.
   - Validation: All prior constraints are satisfied:
     - S is in position 1 (new position tested).
     - U, L, K remain fixed in positions 2, 3, 4.
     - Y tests a new high-frequency consonant-vowel hybrid letter.

This guess resolves the word by directly testing the derived structure. If incorrect, it will narrow position 1 or reveal Y's status.

<guess>sulky</guess>",sulky,"We have feedback for three guesses:

1. ""crane"" -> all letters absent: no C, R, A, N, E.
2. ""moist"" -> M, O, I, T absent; S present but not in position 4.
3. ""bulks"" -> B absent; U present and in correct position (position 2? Let's note that in ""bulks"": B-U-L-K-S, so U is the second letter, and it's marked correct. Also L and K are correct (positions 3 and 4), but S is present but wrong position (it was in position 5).

In ""bulks"":
- Position 1: B -> x (absent)
  Position 2: U -> ✓ (correct)
  Position 3: L -> ✓ (correct)
  Position 4: K -> ✓ (correct)
  Position 5: S -> - (present but wrong position)

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word has U in position 2, L in position 3, K in position 4.
- S is in the word but not in position 5 (and also not in position 4, from previous feedback).
- We have eliminated: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T, B.

So the secret word structure so far: _ U L K _

We know S is one of the letters but not in position 4 or 5. Therefore, it must be in position 1. Why? Because only position 1 is left. The word is 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5. We have fixed 2,3,4: U,L,K. Position 5 is not S (from feedback of bulks: S in pos5 gets -). Position 4 is fixed as K (so not S). The only position left for S is position 1.

Therefore, the secret word must be S U L K ??? But we know S is not in the word? No, we know S is present but not in pos4 or pos5. Since position 2,3,4 are fixed and not S (position2 is U, etc.), then S must be in position1.

But we need to fill position5. Also, we need to confirm if this is the case.

So possible secret words are of the form: S U L K ?

Constraints:
- The word must contain S (which we are now assuming is in position1).
- The last letter (position5) must be a letter that hasn't been eliminated and is not S (since if S were in position5, it would have been marked correct, but it was marked - meaning it is present but not in that position).

In ""bulks"", S was in position5 and got -, so S is not in position5, which is consistent.

Now, what about position1? We haven't fixed it yet, but we know that S must appear somewhere. The only positions we haven't fixed are 1 and 5. We know position5 is not S. Position1 cannot be one of the eliminated letters. But we also know from the feedback on ""moist"" that S is present and not in pos4, and now from ""bulks"", not in pos5. Since pos2,3,4 are fixed, the only possibility is that S is in position1.

Therefore, let's assume the word is S U L K ?.

But we need to find the last letter.

Eliminated letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,T,B.

We also know the letter in position5 is not S, so it must be one of the remaining letters.

What letters are possible for position5?

Available letters: D, F, G, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z. And any that haven't been tested.

But note, we have tested: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,T,B,S,U,L,K. But U,L,K are in the word and fixed, so they don't affect the remaining position except we know S is also present (and we are putting it in pos1).

So position5: must be a letter that is not eliminated and not used in the word? No, it can be a new letter or even one of the letters we already know? But we know U,L,K,S are already used. The word must have exactly these letters? Not necessarily; we know S,U,L,K are present, but there might be a duplicate? For example, the last letter could be S? But we already know S cannot be in position5, and we think S is in position1, so a duplicate S? But in feedback from bulks, we only have one S marked as -, so if there were two S, we might see it? But in bulks, we had S only in position5, so if there is another S in position1, we would only get one '-' for the S in position5, and no indication for the S in position1 because we didn't guess that.

Wait, in guess 3, we guessed ""bulks"", which has no S in position1. We only guessed S in position5. The word we are thinking is S U L K ?, so if the secret word is S U L K S? Then when we guess ""bulks"", which is B U L K S, the feedback would be: B absent -> x, U correct -> ✓, L correct -> ✓, K correct -> ✓, S: we know S is present, but in ""bulks"" it's in position5. In the secret word, if it's S U L K S, then S is in both position1 and position5. So in our guess, we did not guess S in position1, so we get no credit for that. For position5, we guessed S, and it's present but not necessarily correct? If the secret is S U L K S, then position5 is S, so our guess of S in position5 should be ✓. But the feedback was '-', meaning wrong position. Therefore, the secret word cannot have S in position5. So if there is a duplicate S, our feedback would show two S's? Not necessarily; in the feedback system, it marks each instance. Since we only guessed one S (in position5), and if the secret has two, we would only get one symbol corresponding to that S. But importantly, if S were in position5 in the secret, then our S in position5 would be marked ✓, not '-'. So it's confirmed that S is not in position5.

Therefore, position5 must be a letter that is not S, and not eliminated.

And since we are assuming S is in position1, the word becomes: S U L K ?

What are possible words that start with ""SULK"" and end with one letter, that is not eliminated, and the word must be valid.

Possible words: SULK? -> SULKY is one, but Y is available? Yes.

But let's check: ""SULKY"" ends with Y.

Is there any other? ""SULKS"" would be S U L K S, but then position5 is S, which we just argued is not possible because if we guess ""SULKS"" now, but we haven't. However, from feedback, we know S is not in position5. So ""SULKS"" is invalid.

Other words? Let me think. There aren't many words that start with ""SULK"".

Possible: SULKY or SULKA? But sulka is not common; sulky is common.

But is ""SULKY"" valid? Yes.

We also have ""SULPH""? But P and H are available? But is it a word? ""Sulph"" is not standard; ""sulky"" is better.

Alternatively, ""BULKS"" we tried, but that's not starting with S.

So the only common word I can think of is ""SULKY"".

But let's confirm the letters: position1: S, position2: U, position3: L, position4: K, position5: Y.

We haven't eliminated Y. From the feedback so far, we only have eliminated letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,T,B. So Y is still possible.

Also, in the feedback for ""bulks"", the S was marked as '-' meaning present but wrong position. But if the secret is ""SULKY"", and we guessed ""bulks"" (B U L K S), then S is in the secret in position1, which we didn't guess. So in our guess, we had S in position5. Since position5 is not S in secret (secret position5 is Y), so S is present but not in position5, so '-' is correct. The S in position1 is not accounted for in the guess, which is fine because we didn't guess it in that position.

Therefore, we should guess ""SULKY"".

But we have one more thing: in the first guess, ""moist"" had S in position4 (which we now know is secret position4 is K, so S would be mismatched). And we were told S is present but not in position4, meaning S must be in the word elsewhere. In ""SULKY"", S is in position1, so consistent.

We haven't tested Y, but that's fine.

Therefore, our next guess should be ""SULKY"".

But what about double checking if there are other possibilities? Suppose the secret has S in position1, then position5 must be filled. Are there other possibilities besides ""SULKY""? ""SULKS"" doesn't work because secret must not have S in position5. Let me think: ""SULKA""? Doesn't seem standard. ""SULKA"" might be accepted in some dictionaries, but ""sulky"" is more common.

Another possibility: what if S is not in position1? We deduced S must be in position1 because positions 2,3,4 are fixed and not S, and position5 is not S. So unless there is another position? The word has only five positions. So yes, S must be in position1.

Therefore, the secret word is ""SULKY"" or perhaps ""SULCI"" but C is eliminated? Yes, C is eliminated. ""SULKED""? But it's 6 letters. So ""SULKY"" is a valid 5-letter word.

We can also think: we have U in position2, L in 3, K in 4; S must be somewhere else, so position1 is the only logical place.

Thus, we guess ""SULKY"".

But to be thorough, let's see the feedback: in ""bulks"", we have B(x) U(✓) L(✓) K(✓) S(-). So the last letter cannot be S, and must be one that doesn't conflict.

In ""SULKY"", position5 is Y. We haven't guessed Y before, so it might be Y.

Therefore, the guess is ""SULKY"".Based on the previous feedback:
- Guess 1 (""crane""): Eliminated letters C, R, A, N, E (all absent).
- Guess 2 (""moist""): Eliminated letters M, O, I, T (all absent); S is present but not in position 4.
- Guess 3 (""bulks""): Eliminated letter B (absent); Cconfirmed positions: U in position 2, L in position 3, K in position 4; S is present but not in position 5.

### Deductions:
1. **Secret word structure**: Positions 2, 3, and 4 are fixed as U, L, K respectively: `[?] U L K [?]`.
2. **Position 1**: Must contain S. Why? 
   - S is confirmed present in Guess 2 and Guess 3.
   - S cannot be in position 4 (from Guess 2) or position 5 (from Guess 3).
   - Positions 2, 3, and 4 are fixed and not S.
   - Therefore, S must be in position 1.
3. **Position 5**: Must be a valid letter not eliminated and not S.
   - Eliminated letters (C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T, B) cannot be used.
   - Available letters include D, F, G, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
4. **Secret word**: With position 1 as S and positions 2, 3, 4 fixed as U, L, K, the word is `S U L K [?]`. The only common 5-letter word fitting this pattern is **""SULKY""** (meaning gloomy or sullen).
   - Position 5 = Y is untested and not eliminated.
   - Validation: All prior constraints are satisfied:
     - S is in position 1 (new position tested).
     - U, L, K remain fixed in positions 2, 3, 4.
     - Y tests a new high-frequency consonant-vowel hybrid letter.

This guess resolves the word by directly testing the derived structure. If incorrect, it will narrow position 1 or reveal Y's status.",Guess 4: sulky -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) U(✓) L(✓) K(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
