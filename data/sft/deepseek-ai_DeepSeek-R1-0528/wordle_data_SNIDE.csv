We are starting the game. Since it's the first guess, I don't have any feedback. I should choose a word that covers a good spread of common letters to maximize information.

A common starting word in games like Wordle is ""CRANE"" because it includes common vowels (A, E) and consonants (C, R, N). Similarly, ""SLATE"" and ""ROATE"" are good starters. Another popular one is ""ADIEU"" which has a lot of vowels, but I'd prefer a balance.

I think ""CRATE"" is a good starter because it has the letters C, R, A, T, E. These are common letters. However, let me think about ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E. That also seems good.

But note: we want to cover vowels and common consonants. The word ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E. That covers two vowels (A and E) and three consonants. Similarly, ""ROAST"" has R, O, A, S, T.

I recall that in Wordle, the ideal first words have a mix of common letters and avoid repetition. Also, we want to avoid rare letters.

After consideration, I'll go with ""CRANE"".

So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: ✓ (correct position)

So, we know:
- The letter E is in the word and is the last letter (position 5).
- The letter N is in the word, but not in the 4th position (since in ""crane"" it was at position 4 and got a minus).
- The letters C, R, and A are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word:
- Must end with E (position 5).
- Contains the letter N, but not at position 4.
- Does not contain C, R, or A.

We need to make a second guess that is a 5-letter word, ending with E? Not necessarily, but we know the last letter is E.

Actually, the feedback says E is in the correct position, so the fifth letter is E.

So the word pattern is: _ _ _ _ E

Also, the word contains N, but not at position 4. So N must be in one of the first three positions? Actually, positions 1, 2, or 3? But note: the word has 5 positions, and N can be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5? But position 5 is E, so N cannot be at position 5. And we know it's not at position 4 (from the feedback). So N must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

But wait: the feedback for N is a minus, meaning it is in the word but not at the position we guessed (which was position 4). So N is in the word, but not at position 4. It could be at position 1, 2, 3, or 5? But position 5 is E, so that's taken. Therefore, N must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

We also know that the word does not contain C, R, A.

We need to choose a word that:
- Ends with E (so last letter is E)
- Includes the letter N in one of the first three positions? Actually, we can put N in any position except 4 and 5? But 5 is E, so positions 1,2,3 are the only possibilities for N? Actually, position 4 is still available? The feedback only said N is not at position 4, but it could be at position 1,2,3, or even 5? But 5 is E, so no. So N must be in position 1,2, or 3.

But note: the word has 5 positions. We know position 5 is E. Position 4 is unknown, but we know N is not at position 4. So N must be at 1,2, or 3.

Additionally, we want to test other common letters to get more information.

We should avoid using C, R, A again because they are not in the word.

We also know that the word has an N and an E (at the end). And we have three other letters to discover.

Let's think of words that end with E and have an N in one of the first three positions, and without C, R, A.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try to use a word that has many of these common letters.

Also, we want to check the position of N. Since we know N is in the word, we can try to put it in a different position to see if we can pin down its location.

But note: we don't know the position of N yet, so we might want to put N in a position we haven't tested (like position 1 or 2) to see if it gets a check or a minus.

In the first guess, N was at position 4 and got a minus, so we know it's not at 4. Now, if we put N at position 1, and it gets a check, then we know it's at position 1. If it gets a minus, then it must be at position 2 or 3.

Similarly, we can try to cover other common letters.

Let me think of words that end with E and have an N.

Possible words: 
- ...N.E: but we need the whole word.

Examples: 
- ""MINCE"" -> but C is not allowed (we know C is not in the word) and also we have A? No, but C is forbidden.
- ""DUNCE"" -> again, C and also D? But C is not allowed.

We must avoid C, R, A.

So, let's think of words without C, R, A, ending with E, and having N.

Some options:
- ""INANE"" -> but has A? A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word). So no.
- ""OUNCE"" -> has C? no, C is not allowed.
- ""SINCE"" -> has C? no.

We need to avoid A, C, R.

Another word: ""PHONE"" -> P, H, O, N, E. 
- This has no C, R, A. 
- It ends with E. 
- N is at position 4? But we know N cannot be at position 4? Because in the first guess, N was at position 4 and it was wrong. So if we put N at position 4 again, it will be wrong again. But we want to test other positions.

In ""PHONE"", N is at position 4. But we already know that N is not at position 4. So if we use ""PHONE"", we are putting N at position 4 again, which we know is incorrect. That would be a waste because we already know that.

We should put N in a position we haven't tried: position 1, 2, or 3.

So let's look for words that have N at position 1, 2, or 3 and end with E.

For example:
- Position 1: N _ _ _ E -> words like ""NOISE"", ""NOBLE"", ""NUDGE"", etc.
  - ""NOISE"": has O, I, S, E. But we don't know about these letters. Also, no C, R, A.
  - ""NOBLE"": has O, B, L, E. But B and L are new. However, note that ""NOBLE"" has B and L, which are common.
- Position 2: _ N _ _ E -> words like ""SNIDE"", ""UNTIE"", ""ONCIE"" (not a word), ""INLET"", etc.
  - ""INLET"": has I, N, L, E, T. No C, R, A.
- Position 3: _ _ N _ E -> words like ""URINE"", ""PRONE"" (but P and R? R is not allowed), ""TRINE"", etc.

But we must avoid R? Yes, because we know R is not in the word.

So for position 3: 
- ""URINE"": U, R, I, N, E -> has R? R is not allowed. So no.
- ""PRONE"": P, R, O, N, E -> has R? not allowed.
- ""TRINE"": T, R, I, N, E -> has R? not allowed.

So position 3 might be harder? Let me think of words without R.

For example: ""ALINE"" -> but has A? not allowed. 
""OPINE"": O, P, I, N, E -> no A, C, R. This is good. N is at position 4? In ""OPINE"", the letters are O-P-I-N-E, so N is at position 4. But we don't want to put N at position 4 again because we know it's not there.

We want N at position 1, 2, or 3? But in ""OPINE"", N is at position 4, which we know is wrong. So we avoid.

So let's focus on position 1 and 2.

Position 1: N _ _ _ E
- ""NOISE"": N, O, I, S, E -> no A, C, R. Good.
- ""NOBLE"": N, O, B, L, E -> no A, C, R. Good.
- ""NUDGE"": N, U, D, G, E -> no A, C, R. Good.

Position 2: _ N _ _ E
- ""UNTIE"": U, N, T, I, E -> no A, C, R. Good.
- ""INLET"": I, N, L, E, T -> but E is at the end? ""INLET"" is I-N-L-E-T, so the last letter is T, not E. So not ending with E? Wait, we need the last letter to be E.

So for position 2, we need the word to end with E. So the pattern is _ N _ _ E.

Examples:
- ""SNIDE"": S, N, I, D, E -> ends with E, and N at position 2. No A, C, R.
- ""UNTIE"": U, N, T, I, E -> but the last letter is E? U-N-T-I-E -> yes, ends with E. But the positions: U (1), N (2), T (3), I (4), E (5). So N is at position 2. Good.
- ""ONCET"" is not a word.

So options: ""NOISE"", ""NOBLE"", ""NUDGE"", ""SNIDE"", ""UNTIE"".

We also want to cover as many new common letters as possible to get more information.

Common letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U... but we know A and R are out, and we have E and N already.

So we can try to include T, O, I, S, H, D, L, U, etc.

Let's evaluate the options:

- ""NOISE"": letters N, O, I, S, E. We know E is at the end and we are testing O, I, S. Also, N is at position 1. If we get a check for N, then we know it's at position 1. If not, then we know it must be at position 2 or 3 (since we know it's not at 4).

- ""NOBLE"": N, O, B, L, E. Testing O, B, L.

- ""NUDGE"": N, U, D, G, E. Testing U, D, G.

- ""SNIDE"": S, N, I, D, E. N is at position 2. Testing S, I, D.

- ""UNTIE"": U, N, T, I, E. N at position 2. Testing U, T, I.

We want to maximize the information. Since we know E is fixed at the end, we are testing the other four positions.

Also, we know that N is in the word, so we are trying to find its position.

I think ""SNIDE"" is a good candidate because it has S, I, D which are common, and N is at position 2 (a new position). Similarly, ""UNTIE"" has U, T, I.

But note: in ""SNIDE"", we have S at position 1, N at 2, I at 3, D at 4, E at 5.

We know that position 4 in the first guess had N and it was wrong. Now we are putting D at position 4? That's fine.

Similarly, in ""UNTIE"", we have U at 1, N at 2, T at 3, I at 4, E at 5.

We can also consider ""MINCE"" but it has C? not allowed.

Another word: ""LINED"" -> but ends with D, not E. So no.

I think ""SNIDE"" is a valid word and covers good letters.

But let me check if ""SNIDE"" is acceptable. Yes, it means derogatory or mocking.

Another option: ""SHINE"" -> S, H, I, N, E. But N is at position 4? In ""SHINE"": S(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), E(5). But we know N is not at position 4, so we would get a minus for N again. We want to avoid that because we already know it's not at 4. So we should not put N at position 4.

Therefore, ""SHINE"" is not good because it puts N at position 4.

Similarly, ""PHONE"" is not good.

So back to ""SNIDE"": it puts N at position 2, which is a new position.

We can also consider ""NOISE"": N at position 1.

I think both are good. Let me pick one.

Alternatively, we can use a word that doesn't have N? But we know N is in the word, so we should use it to get its position. But we are not required to use N? Actually, we can, but it's better to use it to get more information about its position.

If we don't use N, then we might not get information about its position. But we can use other letters.

But since we have limited tries, it's better to use the known letter N to try to pin down its position.

So I think we should include N in the guess.

Therefore, I'll choose between ""NOISE"" and ""SNIDE"".

In ""NOISE"": 
- If N is at position 1, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and then we know it must be at position 2 or 3 (since we know it's not at 4 and 5 is E).

In ""SNIDE"":
- If N is at position 2, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and then it must be at position 1 or 3.

Both are good. But note that in ""NOISE"", we are also testing O, I, S. In ""SNIDE"", we are testing S, I, D.

The letter S is common. Also, we haven't tested S before.

I think ""SNIDE"" is a good choice because it tests S at the beginning and D at the end (position 4). Also, I at position 3.

But we have to avoid using letters we know are not in the word. We don't know about S, I, D yet.

Another word: ""UNITE"" -> U, N, I, T, E. N at position 2. This is similar to ""UNTIE"", but ""UNTIE"" has T at position 3 and I at 4, while ""UNITE"" has I at 3 and T at 4.

But both are valid.

I think I'll go with ""SNIDE"" because it has a good mix.

So my second guess: ""SNIDE""

But let me confirm: S-N-I-D-E.

We are hoping to get feedback that might reveal the position of N and also test S, I, D.

If we get a check for N, then we know it's at position 2. If not, then it must be at 1 or 3.

Also, we test S, I, D.

So, I think that's a good guess.

Therefore, the next guess is ""snide"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and A are not in the word (x).
- N is in the word but not in position 4 (-).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th, ✓).

Key insights:
- The secret word ends with E (position 5).
- N is present but not in position 4, so it must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- The word contains no C, R, or A.
- The goal is to test new common letters (e.g., S, I, D) and narrow down N's position.

For the second guess, ""snide"" is chosen because:
- It ends with E (matching position 5).
- It places N in position 2 (a new, untested position to check if N is there).
- It includes new common letters: S (position 1), I (position 3), and D (position 4).
- It avoids C, R, and A (known absent letters).

This guess will provide feedback on:
- Whether N is at position 2 (✓ or -).
- Whether S, I, or D are in the word and their positions.

<guess>snide</guess>",snide,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: ✓ (correct position)

So, we know:
- The letter E is in the word and is the last letter (position 5).
- The letter N is in the word, but not in the 4th position (since in ""crane"" it was at position 4 and got a minus).
- The letters C, R, and A are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word:

Similarly, we can try to cover other common letters.

Another word: ""PHONE"" -> P, H, O, N, E.

- It ends with E. 
- N is at position 4? But we know N cannot be at position 4? Because in the first guess, N was at position 4 and it was wrong. So if we put N at position 4 again, it will be wrong again. But we want to test other positions.

In ""PHONE"", N is at position 4. But we already know that N is not at position 4. So if we use ""PHONE"", we are putting N at position 4 again, which we know is incorrect. That would be a waste because we already know that.

We should put N in a position we haven't tried: position 1, 2, or 3.

So let's look for words that have N at position 1, 2, or 3 and end with E.

For example:
- Position 1: N _ _ _ E -> words like ""NOISE"", ""NOBLE"", ""NUDGE"", etc.
  - ""NOISE"": has O, I, S, E. But we don't know about these letters. Also, no C, R, A.
  - ""NOBLE"": has O, B, L, E. But B and L are new. However, note that ""NOBLE"" has B and L, which are common.
- Position 2: _ N _ _ E -> words like ""SNIDE"", ""UNTIE"", ""ONCIE"" (not a word), ""INLET"", etc.
  - ""INLET"": has I, N, L, E, T. No C, R, A.
- Position 3: _ _ N _ E -> words like ""URINE"", ""PRONE"" (but P and R? R is not allowed), ""TRINE"", etc.

But we must avoid R? Yes, because we know R is not in the word.

So for position 3: 
- ""URINE"": U, R, I, N, E -> has R? R is not allowed. So no.
- ""PRONE"": P, R, O, N, E -> has R? not allowed.
- ""TRINE"": T, R, I, N, E -> has R? not allowed.

So position 3 might be harder? Let me think of words without R.

For example: ""ALINE"" -> but has A? not allowed. 
""OPINE"": O, P, I, N, E -> no A, C, R. This is good. N is at position 4? In ""OPINE"", the letters are O-P-I-N-E, so N is at position 4. But we don't want to put N at position 4 again because we know it's not there.

We want N at position 1, 2, or 3? But in ""OPINE"", N is at position 4, which we know is wrong. So we avoid.

So let's focus on position 1 and 2.

Position 1: N _ _ _ E
- ""NOISE"": N, O, I, S, E -> no A, C, R. Good.
- ""NOBLE"": N, O, B, L, E -> no A, C, R. Good.
- ""NUDGE"": N, U, D, G, E -> no A, C, R. Good.

Position 2: _ N _ _ E
- ""UNTIE"": U, N, T, I, E -> no A, C, R. Good.
- ""INLET"": I, N, L, E, T -> but E is at the end? ""INLET"" is I-N-L-E-T, so the last letter is T, not E. So not ending with E? Wait, we need the last letter to be E.

So for position 2, we need the word to end with E. So the pattern is _ N _ _ E.

Examples:
- ""SNIDE"": S, N, I, D, E -> ends with E, and N at position 2. No A, C, R.
- ""UNTIE"": U, N, T, I, E -> but the last letter is E? U-N-T-I-E -> yes, ends with E. But the positions: U (1), N (2), T (3), I (4), E (5). So N is at position 2. Good.
- ""ONCET"" is not a word.

So options: ""NOISE"", ""NOBLE"", ""NUDGE"", ""SNIDE"", ""UNTIE"".

We also want to cover as many new common letters as possible to get more information.

Common letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U... but we know A and R are out, and we have E and N already.

So we can try to include T, O, I, S, H, D, L, U, etc.

Let's evaluate the options:

- ""NOISE"": letters N, O, I, S, E. We know E is at the end and we are testing O, I, S. Also, N is at position 1. If we get a check for N, then we know it's at position 1. If not, then we know it must be at position 2 or 3 (since we know it's not at 4).

- ""NOBLE"": N, O, B, L, E. Testing O, B, L.

- ""NUDGE"": N, U, D, G, E. Testing U, D, G.

- ""SNIDE"": S, N, I, D, E. N is at position 2. Testing S, I, D.

- ""UNTIE"": U, N, T, I, E. N at position 2. Testing U, T, I.

We want to maximize the information. Since we know E is fixed at the end, we are testing the other four positions.

Also, we know that N is in the word, so we are trying to find its position.

I think ""SNIDE"" is a good candidate because it has S, I, D which are common, and N is at position 2 (a new position). Similarly, ""UNTIE"" has U, T, I.

But note: in ""SNIDE"", we have S at position 1, N at 2, I at 3, D at 4, E at 5.

We know that position 4 in the first guess had N and it was wrong. Now we are putting D at position 4? That's fine.

Similarly, in ""UNTIE"", we have U at 1, N at 2, T at 3, I at 4, E at 5.

We can also consider ""MINCE"" but it has C? not allowed.

Another word: ""LINED"" -> but ends with D, not E. So no.

I think ""SNIDE"" is a valid word and covers good letters.

But let me check if ""SNIDE"" is acceptable. Yes, it means derogatory or mocking.

Another option: ""SHINE"" -> S, H, I, N, E. But N is at position 4? In ""SHINE"": S(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), E(5). But we know N is not at position 4, so we would get a minus for N again. We want to avoid that because we already know it's not at 4. So we should not put N at position 4.

Therefore, ""SHINE"" is not good because it puts N at position 4.

Similarly, ""PHONE"" is not good.

So back to ""SNIDE"": it puts N at position 2, which is a new position.

We can also consider ""NOISE"": N at position 1.

I think both are good. Let me pick one.

Alternatively, we can use a word that doesn't have N? But we know N is in the word, so we should use it to get its position. But we are not required to use N? Actually, we can, but it's better to use it to get more information about its position.

If we don't use N, then we might not get information about its position. But we can use other letters.

But since we have limited tries, it's better to use the known letter N to try to pin down its position.

So I think we should include N in the guess.

Therefore, I'll choose between ""NOISE"" and ""SNIDE"".

In ""NOISE"": 
- If N is at position 1, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and then we know it must be at position 2 or 3 (since we know it's not at 4 and 5 is E).

In ""SNIDE"":
- If N is at position 2, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and then it must be at position 1 or 3.

Both are good. But note that in ""NOISE"", we are also testing O, I, S. In ""SNIDE"", we are testing S, I, D.

The letter S is common. Also, we haven't tested S before.

I think ""SNIDE"" is a good choice because it tests S at the beginning and D at the end (position 4). Also, I at position 3.

But we have to avoid using letters we know are not in the word. We don't know about S, I, D yet.

Another word: ""UNITE"" -> U, N, I, T, E. N at position 2. This is similar to ""UNTIE"", but ""UNTIE"" has T at position 3 and I at 4, while ""UNITE"" has I at 3 and T at 4.

But both are valid.

I think I'll go with ""SNIDE"" because it has a good mix.

So my second guess: ""SNIDE""

But let me confirm: S-N-I-D-E.

We are hoping to get feedback that might reveal the position of N and also test S, I, D.

If we get a check for N, then we know it's at position 2. If not, then it must be at 1 or 3.

Also, we test S, I, D.

So, I think that's a good guess.

Therefore, the next guess is ""snide"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and A are not in the word (x).
- N is in the word but not in position 4 (-).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th, ✓).

Key insights:
- The secret word ends with E (position 5).
- N is present but not in position 4, so it must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- The word contains no C, R, or A.
- The goal is to test new common letters (e.g., S, I, D) and narrow down N's position.

For the second guess, ""snide"" is chosen because:
- It ends with E (matching position 5).
- It places N in position 2 (a new, untested position to check if N is there).
- It includes new common letters: S (position 1), I (position 3), and D (position 4).
- It avoids C, R, and A (known absent letters).

This guess will provide feedback on:
- Whether N is at position 2 (✓ or -).
- Whether S, I, or D are in the word and their positions.",Guess 2: snide -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) N(✓) I(✓) D(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
