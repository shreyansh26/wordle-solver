We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the secret word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the secret word)
 N: - (in the word but wrong position)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R, N, and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R is not in position 2, N is not in position 4, and E is not in position 5.
 - The letters C and A are not in the secret word at all.

 We also know that the secret word is 5 letters long.

 We need to make a second guess that:
   - Does not use C or A (since they are absent)
   - Includes R, N, E (but in different positions than in ""crane"")
   - We might also want to include other common letters to test.

 Since R, N, and E are in the word, we can try to place them in new positions.

 In ""crane"", the positions were:
   C (1), R (2), A (3), N (4), E (5)

 So for the next guess, we must avoid:
   - Putting R at position 2
   - Putting N at position 4
   - Putting E at position 5

 Also, we cannot use C or A.

 Let's think of words that have R, N, E and two other letters (which we don't know yet) and that place R, N, E in new positions.

 We can also consider that the word might have repeated letters? But typically in Wordle, words can have repeated letters, but it's less common. Since the feedback didn't indicate any duplicate, we assume no duplicates for now.

 We have three known letters: R, N, E. We need two more letters.

 We can try to use a word that has R, N, E and two new common consonants or vowels.

 Common consonants: T, S, L, etc.

 Let's try to form a word.

 Possibilities:

 We know R cannot be at position 2. So R can be at 1, 3, 4, or 5.
 Similarly, N cannot be at 4, so N can be at 1,2,3,5.
 E cannot be at 5, so E can be at 1,2,3,4.

 We also want to test new letters. Let's try to include 'T' and 'S' for example.

 Example words:

 - ""RENTS"": 
   R at position 1 (which is new for R, since previously R was at 2 -> now 1 is different)
   E at position 2 (previously E was at 5 -> now 2 is different)
   N at position 3 (previously N was at 4 -> now 3 is different)
   T and S are new.

 But note: we don't know if T and S are in the word. This is a way to test.

 Alternatively, ""ROTED"" is not a word. We need valid words.

 Another idea: ""INERT"" -> but we cannot use A and C, but I is allowed? However, we don't know about I. But note: we have to avoid A and C, but other vowels are possible.

 However, we have to be cautious: the word must be valid.

 Let me think of words that have R, N, E and two other letters.

 Some options:

 - ""RENEW"" -> but E is repeated? We don't know if repetition is allowed. Also, E is at position 2 and 4? But we know E is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. However, the feedback for the first guess only showed one E as present, but if there were two, it would have shown two minuses? Actually, the feedback only marks each letter that is present. If a letter is repeated and one is in the correct position, it would show a check for that one and a minus for the other? But in our case, we only had one E and it was marked as minus. So the word might have one E or more? We don't know.

 But to keep it simple, let's avoid duplicates for now.

 Another word: ""ROBIN"" -> but we don't have E? We must include E because we know it's in the word. So we need R, N, and E.

 How about ""DRIVE""? But we don't have N? We must include N because we know it's in the word.

 We must include R, N, and E.

 Let me try: ""RINSE"" -> 
   R at 1 (new position, previously 2 -> so allowed)
   I at 2 (new letter)
   N at 3 (previously at 4, now 3 -> allowed)
   S at 4 (new letter)
   E at 5 -> but wait, in the first guess E was at 5 and we got a minus meaning E is in the word but not at 5. So we cannot put E at 5 again? Actually, we can, but if we put E at 5 and the secret word has E at 5, then we would get a check. But the feedback said E is not at 5, so if we put E at 5 again, we know it will be wrong? Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at 5 again, it will still be wrong. So we should avoid putting E at 5.

 Therefore, in ""RINSE"", E is at 5 -> which is the same position as before. We know that position is wrong, so we should avoid that.

 We need a word that has E not at 5.

 How about ""RENEW""? But that has two E's. And the second E is at 5? So we have E at 2 and 5. We know E is not at 5, so the E at 5 would be wrong, but the E at 2 might be correct? But we don't know. Also, we are using two E's.

 Alternatively, ""URINE"" -> 
   U at 1 (new)
   R at 2 -> but wait, in the first guess R was at 2 and we got a minus meaning R is not at 2. So we cannot put R at 2 again? Actually, we can, but we know it's not at 2 so it will be minus again. We want to try R in a new position.

 So we should avoid putting R at 2, N at 4, and E at 5.

 Let me try to find a word that has:
   R at 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2)
   N at 1,2,3,5 (but not 4)
   E at 1,2,3,4 (but not 5)

 And the word must be 5 letters and not contain C or A.

 Example: ""RODEO"" -> no N and E? Not good.

 Another: ""HORDE"" -> 
   H at 1
   O at 2
   R at 3 -> allowed (since R was at 2, now 3 is new)
   D at 4
   E at 5 -> not allowed (because E cannot be at 5)

 So we avoid E at 5.

 How about ""HORNE""? Not a word.

 ""RENAL"" -> but A is not allowed? We know A is not in the word, so we cannot use A.

 ""RENAL"" has A -> invalid.

 ""REIGN"" -> 
   R at 1 -> allowed (not position 2)
   E at 2 -> allowed (not position 5)
   I at 3
   G at 4
   N at 5 -> allowed (not position 4)

 This seems good: 
   Positions: R(1), E(2), I(3), G(4), N(5)

 We are testing R at 1, E at 2, and N at 5. Also, we are introducing I and G.

 So let's go with ""REIGN"".

 But note: we are not using the fact that in the first word, we had R at 2 and now we are putting R at 1. Similarly, E was at 5 and now at 2, and N was at 4 and now at 5.

 This is a valid guess.

 Alternatively, we could try ""ROUTE"" -> but E at 5 is not allowed.

 Another option: ""SERIF"" -> 
   S at 1
   E at 2 -> allowed
   R at 3 -> allowed (not 2)
   I at 4
   F at 5

 But we are missing N? We must include N because we know it's in the word. So we cannot leave out N.

 Therefore, we must have R, N, and E in the guess.

 So ""REIGN"" is a valid word that includes R, N, E and avoids the forbidden positions.

 Let me check if ""REIGN"" is a valid English word: yes, it means to rule.

 So I will guess ""REIGN"".

 However, note that we are also trying to test new letters. We are testing I and G, which we haven't tried before.

 We might also consider ""NERDY"" -> 
   N at 1 -> allowed (not 4)
   E at 2 -> allowed (not 5)
   R at 3 -> allowed (not 2)
   D at 4
   Y at 5

 But we don't know about D and Y. And ""NERDY"" is a word.

 But we have to choose one. Let me compare:

 ""REIGN"" and ""NERDY""

 Both are valid. But ""REIGN"" uses G and I, while ""NERDY"" uses D and Y.

 We might want to use more common letters. G is more common than Y? And D is common.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ENTER"" -> 
   E at 1 -> allowed (not 5)
   N at 2 -> allowed (not 4)
   T at 3
   E at 4 -> but wait, we are repeating E? We don't know if the word has two E's. Also, we are putting E at 1 and 4. The feedback for the first guess only showed one E, but that doesn't mean there isn't two. However, we are using two E's and we only know one is present. This might be inefficient.

 So I think ""REIGN"" is a good choice.

 Let me see if there's a word that uses more common letters. For example, including T or S.

 How about ""RENTS"": 
   R at 1 -> allowed
   E at 2 -> allowed
   N at 3 -> allowed (previously at 4, now 3 is new)
   T at 4 -> but wait, N was at 4 in the first guess and we got a minus meaning N is not at 4. But now we are putting T at 4? That's fine. And S at 5.

 But E is at 2 and we are not repeating. Also, we are including T and S, which are common.

 However, we have to avoid putting E at 5? We are not. But note: we are putting N at 3 and E at 2, which are new positions.

 But what about the letter S? We don't know if it's in the word.

 Also, in ""RENTS"", we have R, E, N, T, S. That's five distinct letters? Yes.

 And the positions: 
   R:1 (new), E:2 (new), N:3 (new), T:4, S:5.

 We are testing T and S, which are common.

 But note: we are not using the fact that we know E is in the word? We are using E, so that's good.

 However, we are putting E at 2. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 Also, we are putting N at 3, which is a new position.

 But wait: in the first guess, we had R at 2 and now we are putting R at 1. That's good.

 So ""RENTS"" is also a good candidate.

 Which one to choose? 

 We want to maximize information. ""RENTS"" uses T and S, which are very common. ""REIGN"" uses I and G, which are less common.

 So ""RENTS"" might be better.

 But note: we are putting E at 2 and we don't know if that's correct. Also, we are putting N at 3 and T at 4 and S at 5.

 Alternatively, we can try ""STERN"": 
   S at 1
   T at 2
   E at 3 -> allowed (not 5)
   R at 4 -> allowed (not 2)
   N at 5 -> allowed (not 4)

 This also includes R, N, E and uses S and T.

 And the positions are all new for R, N, E.

 So ""STERN"" is another option.

 Let me compare:

 ""RENTS"": R1, E2, N3, T4, S5
 ""STERN"": S1, T2, E3, R4, N5

 Both are valid.

 But note: in ""STERN"", we are putting R at 4 and N at 5. We haven't tried these positions.

 Also, we are testing S and T in both.

 I think ""STERN"" might be slightly better because it places R and N in positions we haven't tested at all (4 and 5) and E in 3.

 But we are also testing S at 1 and T at 2.

 Alternatively, we can choose ""ROUSE"" -> but E at 5 is not allowed.

 After consideration, I think ""STERN"" is a good choice.

 However, we must avoid using A and C, and both ""RENTS"" and ""STERN"" are safe.

 I'll go with ""STERN"" because it uses common letters and tests new positions.

 But note: we have to make sure we don't use any forbidden letters. We know the secret word does not contain C or A. ""STERN"" has S, T, E, R, N -> no C or A. Good.

 So let's choose ""STERN"".

 Alternatively, we can choose ""RENEW"" but that has two E's and we don't know if that's necessary. Also, E at 5 is not allowed? Actually, ""RENEW"" has E at 2 and 5. We know E is not at 5, so the E at 5 would be a waste? But if the word has two E's, then we might get a minus for the E at 5. But we don't know. So it's better to avoid duplicates for now.

 Therefore, I choose ""STERN"".

 But wait, in the first guess, we had R at 2 and we got a minus. Now in ""STERN"", we are putting R at 4. Similarly, E was at 5 and now at 3, and N was at 4 and now at 5. So we are testing new positions.

 So the second guess: ""STERN""

 Let me write it: S T E R N

 But note: the word is ""stern"".

 We'll see the feedback.

 However, note: the feedback for the first guess had R, N, and E as present. So we are including them.

 So I'll go with ""STERN"".
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C and A are absent (x), so they can be excluded from future guesses.
- R, N, and E are present (-) but in incorrect positions. Specifically:
  - R cannot be in position 2.
  - N cannot be in position 4.
  - E cannot be in position 5.

For the second guess, I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Includes R, N, and E (since they are confirmed present).
2. Avoids C and A (confirmed absent).
3. Places R, N, and E in new positions (not 2, 4, and 5 respectively).
4. Tests new common letters (like S and T) for maximum information.

The word ""stern"" fits all criteria:
- Contains R (position 4), N (position 5), and E (position 3) — all in new positions.
- Uses S and T (common letters not yet tested).
- Avoids C and A.
- Is a valid English word.

This guess will help narrow down the positions of R, N, E and test S and T efficiently.

<guess>stern</guess>",stern,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the secret word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the secret word)

 - The secret word contains the letters R, N, and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".

 But note: we are not using the fact that in the first word, we had R at 2 and now we are putting R at 1. Similarly, E was at 5 and now at 2, and N was at 4 and now at 5.

 This is a valid guess.

 Alternatively, we could try ""ROUTE"" -> but E at 5 is not allowed.

 Another option: ""SERIF"" -> 
   S at 1
   E at 2 -> allowed
   R at 3 -> allowed (not 2)
   I at 4
   F at 5

 But we are missing N? We must include N because we know it's in the word. So we cannot leave out N.

 Therefore, we must have R, N, and E in the guess.

 So ""REIGN"" is a valid word that includes R, N, E and avoids the forbidden positions.

 Let me check if ""REIGN"" is a valid English word: yes, it means to rule.

 So I will guess ""REIGN"".

 However, note that we are also trying to test new letters. We are testing I and G, which we haven't tried before.

 We might also consider ""NERDY"" -> 
   N at 1 -> allowed (not 4)
   E at 2 -> allowed (not 5)
   R at 3 -> allowed (not 2)
   D at 4
   Y at 5

 But we don't know about D and Y. And ""NERDY"" is a word.

 But we have to choose one. Let me compare:

 ""REIGN"" and ""NERDY""

 Both are valid. But ""REIGN"" uses G and I, while ""NERDY"" uses D and Y.

 We might want to use more common letters. G is more common than Y? And D is common.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ENTER"" -> 
   E at 1 -> allowed (not 5)
   N at 2 -> allowed (not 4)
   T at 3
   E at 4 -> but wait, we are repeating E? We don't know if the word has two E's. Also, we are putting E at 1 and 4. The feedback for the first guess only showed one E, but that doesn't mean there isn't two. However, we are using two E's and we only know one is present. This might be inefficient.

 So I think ""REIGN"" is a good choice.

 Let me see if there's a word that uses more common letters. For example, including T or S.

 How about ""RENTS"": 
   R at 1 -> allowed
   E at 2 -> allowed
   N at 3 -> allowed (previously at 4, now 3 is new)
   T at 4 -> but wait, N was at 4 in the first guess and we got a minus meaning N is not at 4. But now we are putting T at 4? That's fine. And S at 5.

 But E is at 2 and we are not repeating. Also, we are including T and S, which are common.

 However, we have to avoid putting E at 5? We are not. But note: we are putting N at 3 and E at 2, which are new positions.

 But what about the letter S? We don't know if it's in the word.

 Also, in ""RENTS"", we have R, E, N, T, S. That's five distinct letters? Yes.

 And the positions: 
   R:1 (new), E:2 (new), N:3 (new), T:4, S:5.

 We are testing T and S, which are common.

 But note: we are not using the fact that we know E is in the word? We are using E, so that's good.

 However, we are putting E at 2. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 Also, we are putting N at 3, which is a new position.

 But wait: in the first guess, we had R at 2 and now we are putting R at 1. That's good.

 So ""RENTS"" is also a good candidate.

 Which one to choose? 

 We want to maximize information. ""RENTS"" uses T and S, which are very common. ""REIGN"" uses I and G, which are less common.

 So ""RENTS"" might be better.

 But note: we are putting E at 2 and we don't know if that's correct. Also, we are putting N at 3 and T at 4 and S at 5.

 Alternatively, we can try ""STERN"": 
   S at 1
   T at 2
   E at 3 -> allowed (not 5)
   R at 4 -> allowed (not 2)
   N at 5 -> allowed (not 4)

 This also includes R, N, E and uses S and T.

 And the positions are all new for R, N, E.

 So ""STERN"" is another option.

 Let me compare:

 ""RENTS"": R1, E2, N3, T4, S5
 ""STERN"": S1, T2, E3, R4, N5

 Both are valid.

 But note: in ""STERN"", we are putting R at 4 and N at 5. We haven't tried these positions.

 Also, we are testing S and T in both.

 I think ""STERN"" might be slightly better because it places R and N in positions we haven't tested at all (4 and 5) and E in 3.

 But we are also testing S at 1 and T at 2.

 Alternatively, we can choose ""ROUSE"" -> but E at 5 is not allowed.

 After consideration, I think ""STERN"" is a good choice.

 However, we must avoid using A and C, and both ""RENTS"" and ""STERN"" are safe.

 I'll go with ""STERN"" because it uses common letters and tests new positions.

 But note: we have to make sure we don't use any forbidden letters. We know the secret word does not contain C or A. ""STERN"" has S, T, E, R, N -> no C or A. Good.

 So let's choose ""STERN"".

 Alternatively, we can choose ""RENEW"" but that has two E's and we don't know if that's necessary. Also, E at 5 is not allowed? Actually, ""RENEW"" has E at 2 and 5. We know E is not at 5, so the E at 5 would be a waste? But if the word has two E's, then we might get a minus for the E at 5. But we don't know. So it's better to avoid duplicates for now.

 Therefore, I choose ""STERN"".

 But wait, in the first guess, we had R at 2 and we got a minus. Now in ""STERN"", we are putting R at 4. Similarly, E was at 5 and now at 3, and N was at 4 and now at 5. So we are testing new positions.

 So the second guess: ""STERN""

 Let me write it: S T E R N

 But note: the word is ""stern"".

 We'll see the feedback.

 However, note: the feedback for the first guess had R, N, and E as present. So we are including them.

 So I'll go with ""STERN"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C and A are absent (x), so they can be excluded from future guesses.
- R, N, and E are present (-) but in incorrect positions. Specifically:
  - R cannot be in position 2.
  - N cannot be in position 4.
  - E cannot be in position 5.

For the second guess, I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Includes R, N, and E (since they are confirmed present).
2. Avoids C and A (confirmed absent).
3. Places R, N, and E in new positions (not 2, 4, and 5 respectively).
4. Tests new common letters (like S and T) for maximum information.

The word ""stern"" fits all criteria:
- Contains R (position 4), N (position 5), and E (position 3) — all in new positions.
- Uses S and T (common letters not yet tested).
- Avoids C and A.
- Is a valid English word.

This guess will help narrow down the positions of R, N, E and test S and T efficiently.",Guess 2: stern -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) E(-) R(-) N(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,NEWER,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 I will choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 Let's go with ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E. These are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the secret word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the secret word)
 N: - (in the word but wrong position)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R, N, and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R is not in position 2, N is not in position 4, and E is not in position 5.
 - The letters C and A are not in the secret word at all.

 We also know that the secret word is 5 letters long.

 We need to make a second guess that:
   - Does not use C or A (since they are absent)
   - Includes R, N, E (but in different positions than in ""crane"")
   - We might also want to include other common letters to test.

 Since R, N, and E are in the word, we can try to place them in new positions.

 In ""crane"", the positions were:
   C (1), R (2), A (3), N (4), E (5)

 So for the next guess, we must avoid:
   - Putting R at position 2
   - Putting N at position 4
   - Putting E at position 5

 Also, we cannot use C or A.

 Let's think of words that have R, N, E and two other letters (which we don't know yet) and that place R, N, E in new positions.

 We can also consider that the word might have repeated letters? But typically in Wordle, words can have repeated letters, but it's less common. Since the feedback didn't indicate any duplicate, we assume no duplicates for now.

 We have three known letters: R, N, E. We need two more letters.

 We can try to use a word that has R, N, E and two new common consonants or vowels.

 Common consonants: T, S, L, etc.

 Let's try to form a word.

 Possibilities:

 We know R cannot be at position 2. So R can be at 1, 3, 4, or 5.
 Similarly, N cannot be at 4, so N can be at 1,2,3,5.
 E cannot be at 5, so E can be at 1,2,3,4.

 We also want to test new letters. Let's try to include 'T' and 'S' for example.

 Example words:

 - ""RENTS"": 
   R at position 1 (which is new for R, since previously R was at 2 -> now 1 is different)
   E at position 2 (previously E was at 5 -> now 2 is different)
   N at position 3 (previously N was at 4 -> now 3 is different)
   T and S are new.

 But note: we don't know if T and S are in the word. This is a way to test.

 Alternatively, ""ROTED"" is not a word. We need valid words.

 Another idea: ""INERT"" -> but we cannot use A and C, but I is allowed? However, we don't know about I. But note: we have to avoid A and C, but other vowels are possible.

 However, we have to be cautious: the word must be valid.

 Let me think of words that have R, N, E and two other letters.

 Some options:

 - ""RENEW"" -> but E is repeated? We don't know if repetition is allowed. Also, E is at position 2 and 4? But we know E is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. However, the feedback for the first guess only showed one E as present, but if there were two, it would have shown two minuses? Actually, the feedback only marks each letter that is present. If a letter is repeated and one is in the correct position, it would show a check for that one and a minus for the other? But in our case, we only had one E and it was marked as minus. So the word might have one E or more? We don't know.

 But to keep it simple, let's avoid duplicates for now.

 Another word: ""ROBIN"" -> but we don't have E? We must include E because we know it's in the word. So we need R, N, and E.

 How about ""DRIVE""? But we don't have N? We must include N because we know it's in the word.

 We must include R, N, and E.

 Let me try: ""RINSE"" -> 
   R at 1 (new position, previously 2 -> so allowed)
   I at 2 (new letter)
   N at 3 (previously at 4, now 3 -> allowed)
   S at 4 (new letter)
   E at 5 -> but wait, in the first guess E was at 5 and we got a minus meaning E is in the word but not at 5. So we cannot put E at 5 again? Actually, we can, but if we put E at 5 and the secret word has E at 5, then we would get a check. But the feedback said E is not at 5, so if we put E at 5 again, we know it will be wrong? Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at 5 again, it will still be wrong. So we should avoid putting E at 5.

 Therefore, in ""RINSE"", E is at 5 -> which is the same position as before. We know that position is wrong, so we should avoid that.

 We need a word that has E not at 5.

 How about ""RENEW""? But that has two E's. And the second E is at 5? So we have E at 2 and 5. We know E is not at 5, so the E at 5 would be wrong, but the E at 2 might be correct? But we don't know. Also, we are using two E's.

 Alternatively, ""URINE"" -> 
   U at 1 (new)
   R at 2 -> but wait, in the first guess R was at 2 and we got a minus meaning R is not at 2. So we cannot put R at 2 again? Actually, we can, but we know it's not at 2 so it will be minus again. We want to try R in a new position.

 So we should avoid putting R at 2, N at 4, and E at 5.

 Let me try to find a word that has:
   R at 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2)
   N at 1,2,3,5 (but not 4)
   E at 1,2,3,4 (but not 5)

 And the word must be 5 letters and not contain C or A.

 Example: ""RODEO"" -> no N and E? Not good.

 Another: ""HORDE"" -> 
   H at 1
   O at 2
   R at 3 -> allowed (since R was at 2, now 3 is new)
   D at 4
   E at 5 -> not allowed (because E cannot be at 5)

 So we avoid E at 5.

 How about ""HORNE""? Not a word.

 ""RENAL"" -> but A is not allowed? We know A is not in the word, so we cannot use A.

 ""RENAL"" has A -> invalid.

 ""REIGN"" -> 
   R at 1 -> allowed (not position 2)
   E at 2 -> allowed (not position 5)
   I at 3
   G at 4
   N at 5 -> allowed (not position 4)

 This seems good: 
   Positions: R(1), E(2), I(3), G(4), N(5)

 We are testing R at 1, E at 2, and N at 5. Also, we are introducing I and G.

 So let's go with ""REIGN"".

 But note: we are not using the fact that in the first word, we had R at 2 and now we are putting R at 1. Similarly, E was at 5 and now at 2, and N was at 4 and now at 5.

 This is a valid guess.

 Alternatively, we could try ""ROUTE"" -> but E at 5 is not allowed.

 Another option: ""SERIF"" -> 
   S at 1
   E at 2 -> allowed
   R at 3 -> allowed (not 2)
   I at 4
   F at 5

 But we are missing N? We must include N because we know it's in the word. So we cannot leave out N.

 Therefore, we must have R, N, and E in the guess.

 So ""REIGN"" is a valid word that includes R, N, E and avoids the forbidden positions.

 Let me check if ""REIGN"" is a valid English word: yes, it means to rule.

 So I will guess ""REIGN"".

 However, note that we are also trying to test new letters. We are testing I and G, which we haven't tried before.

 We might also consider ""NERDY"" -> 
   N at 1 -> allowed (not 4)
   E at 2 -> allowed (not 5)
   R at 3 -> allowed (not 2)
   D at 4
   Y at 5

 But we don't know about D and Y. And ""NERDY"" is a word.

 But we have to choose one. Let me compare:

 ""REIGN"" and ""NERDY""

 Both are valid. But ""REIGN"" uses G and I, while ""NERDY"" uses D and Y.

 We might want to use more common letters. G is more common than Y? And D is common.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ENTER"" -> 
   E at 1 -> allowed (not 5)
   N at 2 -> allowed (not 4)
   T at 3
   E at 4 -> but wait, we are repeating E? We don't know if the word has two E's. Also, we are putting E at 1 and 4. The feedback for the first guess only showed one E, but that doesn't mean there isn't two. However, we are using two E's and we only know one is present. This might be inefficient.

 So I think ""REIGN"" is a good choice.

 Let me see if there's a word that uses more common letters. For example, including T or S.

 How about ""RENTS"": 
   R at 1 -> allowed
   E at 2 -> allowed
   N at 3 -> allowed (previously at 4, now 3 is new)
   T at 4 -> but wait, N was at 4 in the first guess and we got a minus meaning N is not at 4. But now we are putting T at 4? That's fine. And S at 5.

 But E is at 2 and we are not repeating. Also, we are including T and S, which are common.

 However, we have to avoid putting E at 5? We are not. But note: we are putting N at 3 and E at 2, which are new positions.

 But what about the letter S? We don't know if it's in the word.

 Also, in ""RENTS"", we have R, E, N, T, S. That's five distinct letters? Yes.

 And the positions: 
   R:1 (new), E:2 (new), N:3 (new), T:4, S:5.

 We are testing T and S, which are common.

 But note: we are not using the fact that we know E is in the word? We are using E, so that's good.

 However, we are putting E at 2. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 Also, we are putting N at 3, which is a new position.

 But wait: in the first guess, we had R at 2 and now we are putting R at 1. That's good.

 So ""RENTS"" is also a good candidate.

 Which one to choose? 

 We want to maximize information. ""RENTS"" uses T and S, which are very common. ""REIGN"" uses I and G, which are less common.

 So ""RENTS"" might be better.

 But note: we are putting E at 2 and we don't know if that's correct. Also, we are putting N at 3 and T at 4 and S at 5.

 Alternatively, we can try ""STERN"": 
   S at 1
   T at 2
   E at 3 -> allowed (not 5)
   R at 4 -> allowed (not 2)
   N at 5 -> allowed (not 4)

 This also includes R, N, E and uses S and T.

 And the positions are all new for R, N, E.

 So ""STERN"" is another option.

 Let me compare:

 ""RENTS"": R1, E2, N3, T4, S5
 ""STERN"": S1, T2, E3, R4, N5

 Both are valid.

 But note: in ""STERN"", we are putting R at 4 and N at 5. We haven't tried these positions.

 Also, we are testing S and T in both.

 I think ""STERN"" might be slightly better because it places R and N in positions we haven't tested at all (4 and 5) and E in 3.

 But we are also testing S at 1 and T at 2.

 Alternatively, we can choose ""ROUSE"" -> but E at 5 is not allowed.

 After consideration, I think ""STERN"" is a good choice.

 However, we must avoid using A and C, and both ""RENTS"" and ""STERN"" are safe.

 I'll go with ""STERN"" because it uses common letters and tests new positions.

 But note: we have to make sure we don't use any forbidden letters. We know the secret word does not contain C or A. ""STERN"" has S, T, E, R, N -> no C or A. Good.

 So let's choose ""STERN"".

 Alternatively, we can choose ""RENEW"" but that has two E's and we don't know if that's necessary. Also, E at 5 is not allowed? Actually, ""RENEW"" has E at 2 and 5. We know E is not at 5, so the E at 5 would be a waste? But if the word has two E's, then we might get a minus for the E at 5. But we don't know. So it's better to avoid duplicates for now.

 Therefore, I choose ""STERN"".

 But wait, in the first guess, we had R at 2 and we got a minus. Now in ""STERN"", we are putting R at 4. Similarly, E was at 5 and now at 3, and N was at 4 and now at 5. So we are testing new positions.

 So the second guess: ""STERN""

 Let me write it: S T E R N

 But note: the word is ""stern"".

 We'll see the feedback.

 However, note: the feedback for the first guess had R, N, and E as present. So we are including them.

 So I'll go with ""STERN"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C and A are absent (x), so they can be excluded from future guesses.
- R, N, and E are present (-) but in incorrect positions. Specifically:
  - R cannot be in position 2.
  - N cannot be in position 4.
  - E cannot be in position 5.

For the second guess, I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Includes R, N, and E (since they are confirmed present).
2. Avoids C and A (confirmed absent).
3. Places R, N, and E in new positions (not 2, 4, and 5 respectively).

This is a way to test.\n\n Alternatively, ""ROTED"" is not a word. We need valid words.\n\n Another idea: ""INERT"" -> but we cannot use A and C, but I is allowed? However, we don\'t know about I. But note: we have to avoid A and C, but other vowels are possible.\n\n However, we have to be cautious: the word must be valid.\n\n Let me think of words that have R, N, E and two other letters.\n\n Some options:\n\n - ""RENEW"" -> but E is repeated? We don\'t know if repetition is allowed. Also, E is at position 2 and 4? But we know E is in the word, but we don\'t know if it appears twice. However, the feedback for the first guess only showed one E as present, but if there were two, it would have shown two minuses? Actually, the feedback only marks each letter that is present. If a letter is repeated and one is in the correct position, it would show a check for that one and a minus for the other? But in our case, we only had one E and it was marked as minus. So the word might have one E or more? We don\'t know.\n\n But to keep it simple, let\'s avoid duplicates for now.\n\n Another word: ""ROBIN"" -> but we don\'t have E? We must include E because we know it\'s in the word. So we need R, N, and E.\n\n How about ""DRIVE""? But we don\'t have N? We must include N because we know it\'s in the word.\n\n We must include R, N, and E.\n\n Let me try: ""RINSE"" -> \n   R at 1 (new position, previously 2 -> so allowed)\n   I at 2 (new letter)\n   N at 3 (previously at 4, now 3 -> allowed)\n   S at 4 (new letter)\n   E at 5 -> but wait, in the first guess E was at 5 and we got a minus meaning E is in the word but not at 5. So we cannot put E at 5 again? Actually, we can, but if we put E at 5 and the secret word has E at 5, then we would get a check. But the feedback said E is not at 5, so if we put E at 5 again, we know it will be wrong? Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at 5 again, it will still be wrong. So we should avoid putting E at 5.\n\n Therefore, in ""RINSE"", E is at 5 -> which is the same position as before. We know that position is wrong, so we should avoid that.\n\n We need a word that has E not at 5.\n\n How about ""RENEW""? But that has two E\'s. And the second E is at 5? So we have E at 2 and 5. We know E is not at 5, so the E at 5 would be wrong, but the E at 2 might be correct? But we don\'t know. Also, we are using two E\'s.\n\n Alternatively, ""URINE"" -> \n   U at 1 (new)\n   R at 2 -> but wait, in the first guess R was at 2 and we got a minus meaning R is not at 2. So we cannot put R at 2 again? Actually, we can, but we know it\'s not at 2 so it will be minus again. We want to try R in a new position.\n\n So we should avoid putting R at 2, N at 4, and E at 5.\n\n Let me try to find a word that has:\n   R at 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2)\n   N at 1,2,3,5 (but not 4)\n   E at 1,2,3,4 (but not 5)\n\n And the word must be 5 letters and not contain C or A.\n\n Example: ""RODEO"" -> no N and E? Not good.\n\n Another: ""HORDE"" -> \n   H at 1\n   O at 2\n   R at 3 -> allowed (since R was at 2, now 3 is new)\n   D at 4\n   E at 5 -> not allowed (because E cannot be at 5)\n\n So we avoid E at 5.\n\n How about ""HORNE""? Not a word.\n\n ""RENAL"" -> but A is not allowed? We know A is not in the word, so we cannot use A.\n\n ""RENAL"" has A -> invalid.\n\n ""REIGN"" -> \n   R at 1 -> allowed (not position 2)\n   E at 2 -> allowed (not position 5)\n   I at 3\n   G at 4\n   N at 5 -> allowed (not position 4)\n\n This seems good: \n   Positions: R(1), E(2), I(3), G(4), N(5)\n\n We are testing R at 1, E at 2, and N at 5. Also, we are introducing I and G.\n\n So let\'s go with ""REIGN"".\n\n But note: we are not using the fact that in the first word, we had R at 2 and now we are putting R at 1. Similarly, E was at 5 and now at 2, and N was at 4 and now at 5.\n\n This is a valid guess.\n\n Alternatively, we could try ""ROUTE"" -> but E at 5 is not allowed.\n\n Another option: ""SERIF"" -> \n   S at 1\n   E at 2 -> allowed\n   R at 3 -> allowed (not 2)\n   I at 4\n   F at 5\n\n But we are missing N? We must include N because we know it\'s in the word. So we cannot leave out N.\n\n Therefore, we must have R, N, and E in the guess.\n\n So ""REIGN"" is a valid word that includes R, N, E and avoids the forbidden positions.\n\n Let me check if ""REIGN"" is a valid English word: yes, it means to rule.\n\n So I will guess ""REIGN"".\n\n However, note that we are also trying to test new letters. We are testing I and G, which we haven\'t tried before.\n\n We might also consider ""NERDY"" -> \n   N at 1 -> allowed (not 4)\n   E at 2 -> allowed (not 5)\n   R at 3 -> allowed (not 2)\n   D at 4\n   Y at 5\n\n But we don\'t know about D and Y. And ""NERDY"" is a word.\n\n But we have to choose one. Let me compare:\n\n ""REIGN"" and ""NERDY""\n\n Both are valid. But ""REIGN"" uses G and I, while ""NERDY"" uses D and Y.\n\n We might want to use more common letters. G is more common than Y? And D is common.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""ENTER"" -> \n   E at 1 -> allowed (not 5)\n   N at 2 -> allowed (not 4)\n   T at 3\n   E at 4 -> but wait, we are repeating E? We don\'t know if the word has two E\'s. Also, we are putting E at 1 and 4. The feedback for the first guess only showed one E, but that doesn\'t mean there isn\'t two. However, we are using two E\'s and we only know one is present. This might be inefficient.\n\n So I think ""REIGN"" is a good choice.\n\n Let me see if there\'s a word that uses more common letters. For example, including T or S.\n\n How about ""RENTS"": \n   R at 1 -> allowed\n   E at 2 -> allowed\n   N at 3 -> allowed (previously at 4, now 3 is new)\n   T at 4 -> but wait, N was at 4 in the first guess and we got a minus meaning N is not at 4. But now we are putting T at 4? That\'s fine. And S at 5.\n\n But E is at 2 and we are not repeating. Also, we are including T and S, which are common.\n\n However, we have to avoid putting E at 5? We are not. But note: we are putting N at 3 and E at 2, which are new positions.\n\n But what about the letter S? We don\'t know if it\'s in the word.\n\n Also, in ""RENTS"", we have R, E, N, T, S. That\'s five distinct letters? Yes.\n\n And the positions: \n   R:1 (new), E:2 (new), N:3 (new), T:4, S:5.\n\n We are testing T and S, which are common.\n\n But note: we are not using the fact that we know E is in the word? We are using E, so that\'s good.\n\n However, we are putting E at 2. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing.\n\n Also, we are putting N at 3, which is a new position.\n\n But wait: in the first guess, we had R at 2 and now we are putting R at 1. That\'s good.\n\n So ""RENTS"" is also a good candidate.\n\n Which one to choose? \n\n We want to maximize information. ""RENTS"" uses T and S, which are very common. ""REIGN"" uses I and G, which are less common.\n\n So ""RENTS"" might be better.\n\n But note: we are putting E at 2 and we don\'t know if that\'s correct. Also, we are putting N at 3 and T at 4 and S at 5.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""STERN"": \n   S at 1\n   T at 2\n   E at 3 -> allowed (not 5)\n   R at 4 -> allowed (not 2)\n   N at 5 -> allowed (not 4)\n\n This also includes R, N, E and uses S and T.\n\n And the positions are all new for R, N, E.\n\n So ""STERN"" is another option.\n\n Let me compare:\n\n ""RENTS"": R1, E2, N3, T4, S5\n ""STERN"": S1, T2, E3, R4, N5\n\n Both are valid.\n\n But note: in ""STERN"", we are putting R at 4 and N at 5. We haven\'t tried these positions.\n\n Also, we are testing S and T in both.\n\n I think ""STERN"" might be slightly better because it places R and N in positions we haven\'t tested at all (4 and 5) and E in 3.\n\n But we are also testing S at 1 and T at 2.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose ""ROUSE"" -> but E at 5 is not allowed.\n\n After consideration, I think ""STERN"" is a good choice.\n\n However, we must avoid using A and C, and both ""RENTS"" and ""STERN"" are safe.\n\n I\'ll go with ""STERN"" because it uses common letters and tests new positions.\n\n But note: we have to make sure we don\'t use any forbidden letters. We know the secret word does not contain C or A. ""STERN"" has S, T, E, R, N -> no C or A. Good.\n\n So let\'s choose ""STERN"".\n\n Alternatively, we can choose ""RENEW"" but that has two E\'s and we don\'t know if that\'s necessary. Also, E at 5 is not allowed? Actually, ""RENEW"" has E at 2 and 5. We know E is not at 5, so the E at 5 would be a waste? But if the word has two E\'s, then we might get a minus for the E at 5. But we don\'t know. So it\'s better to avoid duplicates for now.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""STERN"".\n\n But wait, in the first guess, we had R at 2 and we got a minus. Now in ""STERN"", we are putting R at 4. Similarly, E was at 5 and now at 3, and N was at 4 and now at 5. So we are testing new positions.\n\n So the second guess: ""STERN""\n\n Let me write it: S T E R N\n\n But note: the word is ""stern"".\n\n We\'ll see the feedback.\n\n However, note: the feedback for the first guess had R, N, and E as present. So we are including them.\n\n So I\'ll go with ""STERN"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C and A are absent (x), so they can be excluded from future guesses.\n- R, N, and E are present (-) but in incorrect positions. Specifically:\n  - R cannot be in position 2.\n  - N cannot be in position 4.\n  - E cannot be in position 5.\n\nFor the second guess, I need a 5-letter word that:\n1. Includes R, N, and E (since they are confirmed present).\n2. Avoids C and A (confirmed absent).\n3. Places R, N, and E in new positions (not 2, 4, and 5 respectively).\n4. Tests new common letters (like S and T) for maximum information.\n\nThe word ""stern"" fits all criteria:\n- Contains R (position 4), N (position 5), and E (position 3) — all in new positions.\n- Uses S and T (common letters not yet tested).\n- Avoids C and A.\n- Is a valid English word.\n\nThis guess will help narrow down the positions of R, N, E and test S and T efficiently.\n\n<guess>stern</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: stern -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) E(-) R(-) N(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: - (in word, wrong position)
  A: x (not in word)
  N: - (in word, wrong position)
  E: - (in word, wrong position)

From this, we know:
- The secret word contains R, N, E (each at least once).
- It does not contain C or A.
- R is not at position 2.
- N is not at position 4.
- E is not at position 5.

Guess 2: ""stern""
  S: x (not in word)
  T: x (not in word)
  E: - (in word, wrong position)
  R: - (in word, wrong position)
  N: - (in word, wrong position)

From this, we know:
- The secret word does not contain S or T.
- E is in the word but not at position 3 (since ""stern"" has E at position 3 and it got a minus).
- R is in the word but not at position 4 (since ""stern"" has R at position 4 and it got a minus).
- N is in the word but not at position 5 (since ""stern"" has N at position 5 and it got a minus).

We also know that E is not at position 5 (from guess1) and not at position 3 (from guess2). Similarly, R is not at position 2 (guess1) and not at position 4 (guess2). N is not at position 4 (guess1) and not at position 5 (guess2).

So summary:

Letters in the word: R, N, E (definitely at least once each)
Letters not in the word: C, A, S, T

We need to include R, N, E and two new letters.

Position constraints:

For R:
Cannot be at: 2 (from ""crane"") and 4 (from ""stern"")
So possible positions: 1, 3, 5

For N:
Cannot be at: 4 (from ""crane"") and 5 (from ""stern"")
So possible positions: 1, 2, 3

For E:
Cannot be at: 5 (from ""crane"") and 3 (from ""stern"")
So possible positions: 1, 2, 4

We have used up two guesses and have four left.

We need to choose a word that:
- Contains R, N, E
- Does not contain C, A, S, T
- Places R, N, E in positions that are still possible according to the constraints.

Also, we must introduce two new letters to test.

We have already tested: C, R, A, N, E, S, T (7 letters). So the remaining letters are many, but we need common ones.

We can use letters like: L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with R, N, E and two others.

We need to form a valid word.

We also have to consider the positions: R must be at 1,3,5; N at 1,2,3; E at 1,2,4.

We can try to fix the positions and look for words.

For example, let R be at position 3 (one of the options). Then what?

Possible word structures.

Let me think of words containing R, N, E.

Since E has only three possible positions (1,2,4), and R has three (1,3,5), and N has three (1,2,3), we need overlap.

We cannot have repeated letters? We don't know, but in the feedback so far, there has been no indication of duplicates. So we assume no duplicates for now.

So let E be at position 4. Then we have positions 1,2,3,5 to place R and N (and two other letters).

But E at 4: then positions:
1: ?
2: ?
3: ?
5: ?

N must be at 1,2,3 (since it cannot be at 4 or 5). Similarly, R must be at 1,3,5.

If E is at 4, then position 4 is taken by E.

Then for N: can be at 1,2,3.

For R: can be at 1,3,5.

But if R is at 3, and E at 4, then the word might be ? ? R E ?

But N must be in one of 1,2,3.

For example, if N at 1: then word: N ? R E ?

If N at 2: word: ? N R E ?

If N at 3: but R might also be at 3? But we assume distinct, so they can't both be at 3. So if E is at 4, position 3 must be either R or N? But we have to assign.

Actually, position 3 can be R or one of the new letters, and similarly.

But let's look for actual words.

Try E at position 4.

Possible words:

- ENDER: but has E at 2? And E at 5? We have E at 4, but also E at 2 and 5? That's multiple E's? But let's see structure.

We need E only once? We don't know.

But try: words like ""RENEW"" has E at 2 and 5 -> not good because E cannot be at 5.

Other words: How about ""LINER""? But we don't know if L and I are in the word.

""LINER"": 
Position 1: L
Position 2: I
Position 3: N
Position 4: E
Position 5: R

Check constraints:
R: at 5 -> allowed (since R can be at 1,3,5)
N: at 3 -> allowed (N can be at 1,2,3)
E: at 4 -> allowed (E can be at 1,2,4)

Also, L and I are new letters (not tested yet).

Also, no C,A,S,T -> good.

Is ""LINER"" a word? Yes, meaning an ocean liner or a person who lines.

So this is a valid guess.

But note: we have N at position 3 and E at 4. In ""crane"", N was at 4 (which is not allowed, but now N at 3) and E was at 5 (not allowed, but now E at 4).

Also, R was at 2 in ""crane"" (not allowed) and now R at 5.

So this word satisfies all position constraints.

We can have other options.

For example, with E at position 4, R at 5, and N at 1: then word structure: N ? ? E R

What words fit? e.g., ""NUDER""? Not a word. ""NEWER"" has two E's? E at 4, but E at 2? And E at 4? And E cannot be at 5? But ""NEWER"" has E at 2 and 5? Not good.

With E at position 4, R at 5, and N at 2: word: ? N ? E R -> e.g., ""INNER"" has two N's? Not good. Or ""MINER"": M at 1, I at 2? Then N at 3? But we need N at 2? ""MINER"" is M I N E R -> positions: N at 3, E at 4, R at 5. So N at 3 (allowed), E at 4 (allowed), R at 5 (allowed). Then the second letter is I? So word: M I N E R.

""M"" and ""I"" are new letters.

""MINER"" is a word.

Similarly, we could have ""LINER"" as above.

Another option: E at position 4, R at 3, and N somewhere? But R at 3: so positions 1,2 have letters? Then E at 4, then 5.

N can be at 1 or 2.

If N at 1: word: N ? R E ? -> e.g., ""NARES"" but has A -> invalid. ""NORES"" but O? And we don't have A, but O? Also, ""NORES"" is not common? Actually, ""N"" something ""R"" ""E"" S -> but S is invalid? We know S is not in the word.

We cannot use S.

So perhaps not.

With E at other positions.

For example, E at position 1: allowed? E can be at 1,2,4.

Then if E at 1, then word must be E ? ? ? ?

Then R must be at 3 or 5? Or at 1? But 1 is E, so R cannot be at 1. So R at 3 or 5.

N must be at 1? But 1 is E, so cannot have N at 1? So N must be at 2 or 3.

But position 1 is E.

So E at 1.

Possible: word E _ _ _ _

For N: can be position 2 or 3.

For R: can be position 3 or 5.

If N at 2: and R at 3: then E at 1, N at 2, R at 3 -> then positions 4 and 5 are new letters.

Word: E N R ? ? 

What words? ""ENROL"" but has O and L? But O is allowed? But the word has E at 1, N at 2, R at 3, O at 4, L at 5.

But N at 2: allowed? Yes.

R at 3: allowed? Yes (R cannot be at 2 or 4, but 3 is okay).

But we have O and L.

Is this a word? ""ENROL"" -> yes.

But note: we don't know if O and L are in the word.

Similarly, we could have other words.

But let's compare with ""MINER"" or ""LINER"".

Another structure: E at position 2.

Then word: ? E ? ? ?

E at position 2: allowed.

Then R possible positions: 1,3,5 (since cannot be 2 or 4? Wait, R cannot be at 2, but E is at 2? So no problem. R can be at 1,3,5)

N possible positions: 1,2,3? But 2 is E, so N can only be at 1 or 3.

So if E at 2:

Then N at 1 or 3.

R at 1,3,5? But if N at 1, then R can be at 3 or 5? Not at 1.

If N at 1: then R at 3 or 5.

Then word: N E ? ? R  or N E ? R ?  (if R at 3 or 5)

For example: N E R ? ? -> but R at 3? And E at 2.

Word: ""NERDY"" but we know D and Y? But also, we know S and T are invalid? S and T are out, but D and Y we don't know.

""Nerdy"" has positions: N1, E2, R3, D4, Y5.

Constraints: N at 1: allowed (N positions:1,2,3)
E at 2: allowed? Yes (since E must not be at 3 or 5? E cannot be at 3? From ""stern"", E at 3 got minus? And cannot be at 5 from ""crane"". But position 2 is new? Yes, so allowed.

But note: E was at 5 in ""crane"" and not at 3 in ""stern"", so position 2 is indeed available.

Similarly, R at 3: allowed? R cannot be at 2 or 4? 3 is allowed? Yes.

So ""NERDY"" is possible: letters N, E, R, D, Y -> no C,A,S,T -> valid.

But is Y a common letter? Not very, but possible.

Alternatively, N E and then position 3 and 4,5.

Examples: N E S S T -> but S and T are invalid.

Not possible.

Another: N E W E R -> two E's? and E not at 5? But position 5 is R? Actually, ""newer"" has E at 2 and 5? But E cannot be at 5? So if we guess ""NEWER"", E at 5 would be wrong.

But we have E at position 5 again? We should avoid since we know E is not at 5.

Therefore, ""NERDY"" or ""MINER"" or ""LINER"" or ""ENROL"".

We need to pick one.

Also, we must maximize information. So we want to test common unused letters.

Unused letters so far: all except C,A,S,T,R,N,E (and the ones used in guesses, but only c,a,n,e,r,s,t).

So guess1: c,r,a,n,e -> letters tested: C,R,A,N,E
guess2: s,t,e,r,n -> letters tested: S,T,E,R,N

So tested: A, C, E, N, R, S, T.

So unused: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want common letters: e.g., L, I, O, D, U, M, P, etc.

We can calculate frequency, but roughly.

For now, I think ""LINER"" is a good choice because it uses L and I, which are common vowels and consonants.

Similarly, ""MINER"" uses M and I.

""NERDY"" uses D and Y.

""ENROL"" uses O and L.

""LINER"" uses L and I.

We can choose ""LINER"" or ""MINER"".

Let me pick ""MINER"" because M is a common consonant.

""MINER"" structure:
Position 1: M
Position 2: I
Position 3: N
Position 4: E
Position 5: R

Constraints:
E at 4: allowed (E possible positions 1,2,4)
N at 3: allowed (N possible positions 1,2,3)
R at 5: allowed (R possible positions 1,3,5)

And M and I are new.

We haven't tested M or I.

Thus, a good guess.

We could also do ""LINER"" with L at 1 and I at 2.

But both are valid.

I think ""MINER"" is slightly better? Or not sure.

Another word: ""DINER"" -> 
Position 1: D
Position 2: I
Position 3: N
Position 4: E
Position 5: R? 

But E at 4: allowed? Yes.
N at 3: allowed? Yes.
R at 5: allowed? Yes.

And D and I are new.

Also valid.

But ""miner"" is more common? 

Since we have to choose, I'll go with ""miner"".

But note: we don't know if M is in the word. We are testing it.

If M is absent, we get an 'x' for M, which is useful.

Similarly, for I.

So I think ""MINER"" is a reasonable guess.

After research, I found that ""miner"" is an appropriate word to use.

So the third guess: ""MINER""

In the response format, we output the guess.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: R, N, and E are present but in incorrect positions (R not in position 2, N not in position 4, E not in position 5). C and A are absent.
- **Guess 2 (stern)**: E, R, and N are present but in incorrect positions (E not in position 3, R not in position 4, N not in position 5). S and T are absent.

Key deductions:
- The secret word contains R, N, and E (each at least once), and excludes C, A, S, T.
- Position constraints:
  - R can only be in positions 1, 3, or 5 (not 2 or 4).
  - N can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (not 4 or 5).
  - E can only be in positions 1, 2, or 4 (not 3 or 5).
- The word must be 5 letters, using only untested letters besides R, N, E (e.g., avoiding C, A, S, T).

For this guess, ""MINER"" is selected because:
- It includes R, N, E (required).
- It avoids forbidden letters (C, A, S, T).
- It places R, N, E in valid positions based on constraints:
  - R at position 5 (allowed).
  - N at position 3 (allowed).
  - E at position 4 (allowed).
- It introduces two new common letters (M and I) for testing.

- N is not at position 4.
- E is not at position 5.

Guess 2: ""stern""
  S: x (not in word)
  T: x (not in word)
  E: - (in word, wrong position)
  R: - (in word, wrong position)
  N: - (in word, wrong position)

From this, we know:
- The secret word does not contain S or T.
- E is in the word but not at position 3 (since ""stern"" has E at position 3 and it got a minus).
- R is in the word but not at position 4 (since ""stern"" has R at position 4 and it got a minus).
- N is in the word but not at position 5 (since ""stern"" has N at position 5 and it got a minus).

We also know that E is not at position 5 (from guess1) and not at position 3 (from guess2). Similarly, R is not at position 2 (guess1) and not at position 4 (guess2). N is not at position 4 (guess1) and not at position 5 (guess2).

So summary:

Letters in the word: R, N, E (definitely at least once each)
Letters not in the word: C, A, S, T

We need to include R, N, E and two new letters.

Position constraints:

For R:
Cannot be at: 2 (from ""crane"") and 4 (from ""stern"")
So possible positions: 1, 3, 5

For N:
Cannot be at: 4 (from ""crane"") and 5 (from ""stern"")
So possible positions: 1, 2, 3

For E:
Cannot be at: 5 (from ""crane"") and 3 (from ""stern"")
So possible positions: 1, 2, 4

We have used up two guesses and have four left.

We need to choose a word that:
- Contains R, N, E
- Does not contain C, A, S, T
- Places R, N, E in positions that are still possible according to the constraints.

Also, we must introduce two new letters to test.

We have already tested: C, R, A, N, E, S, T (7 letters). So the remaining letters are many, but we need common ones.

We can use letters like: L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with R, N, E and two others.

We need to form a valid word.

We also have to consider the positions: R must be at 1,3,5; N at 1,2,3; E at 1,2,4.

We can try to fix the positions and look for words.

For example, let R be at position 3 (one of the options). Then what?

Possible word structures.

Let me think of words containing R, N, E.

Since E has only three possible positions (1,2,4), and R has three (1,3,5), and N has three (1,2,3), we need overlap.

We cannot have repeated letters? We don't know, but in the feedback so far, there has been no indication of duplicates. So we assume no duplicates for now.

So let E be at position 4. Then we have positions 1,2,3,5 to place R and N (and two other letters).

But E at 4: then positions:
1: ?
2: ?
3: ?
5: ?

N must be at 1,2,3 (since it cannot be at 4 or 5). Similarly, R must be at 1,3,5.

If E is at 4, then position 4 is taken by E.

Then for N: can be at 1,2,3.

For R: can be at 1,3,5.

But if R is at 3, and E at 4, then the word might be ? ? R E ?

But N must be in one of 1,2,3.

For example, if N at 1: then word: N ? R E ?

If N at 2: word: ? N R E ?

If N at 3: but R might also be at 3? But we assume distinct, so they can't both be at 3. So if E is at 4, position 3 must be either R or N? But we have to assign.

Actually, position 3 can be R or one of the new letters, and similarly.

But let's look for actual words.

Try E at position 4.

Possible words:

- ENDER: but has E at 2? And E at 5? We have E at 4, but also E at 2 and 5? That's multiple E's? But let's see structure.

We need E only once? We don't know.

But try: words like ""RENEW"" has E at 2 and 5 -> not good because E cannot be at 5.

Other words: How about ""LINER""? But we don't know if L and I are in the word.

""LINER"": 
Position 1: L
Position 2: I
Position 3: N
Position 4: E
Position 5: R

Check constraints:
R: at 5 -> allowed (since R can be at 1,3,5)
N: at 3 -> allowed (N can be at 1,2,3)
E: at 4 -> allowed (E can be at 1,2,4)

Also, L and I are new letters (not tested yet).

Also, no C,A,S,T -> good.

Is ""LINER"" a word? Yes, meaning an ocean liner or a person who lines.

So this is a valid guess.

But note: we have N at position 3 and E at 4. In ""crane"", N was at 4 (which is not allowed, but now N at 3) and E was at 5 (not allowed, but now E at 4).

Also, R was at 2 in ""crane"" (not allowed) and now R at 5.

So this word satisfies all position constraints.

We can have other options.

For example, with E at position 4, R at 5, and N at 1: then word structure: N ? ? E R

What words fit? e.g., ""NUDER""? Not a word. ""NEWER"" has two E's? E at 4, but E at 2? And E at 4? And E cannot be at 5? But ""NEWER"" has E at 2 and 5? Not good.

With E at position 4, R at 5, and N at 2: word: ? N ? E R -> e.g., ""INNER"" has two N's? Not good. Or ""MINER"": M at 1, I at 2? Then N at 3? But we need N at 2? ""MINER"" is M I N E R -> positions: N at 3, E at 4, R at 5. So N at 3 (allowed), E at 4 (allowed), R at 5 (allowed). Then the second letter is I? So word: M I N E R.

""M"" and ""I"" are new letters.

""MINER"" is a word.

Similarly, we could have ""LINER"" as above.

Another option: E at position 4, R at 3, and N somewhere? But R at 3: so positions 1,2 have letters? Then E at 4, then 5.

N can be at 1 or 2.

If N at 1: word: N ? R E ? -> e.g., ""NARES"" but has A -> invalid. ""NORES"" but O? And we don't have A, but O? Also, ""NORES"" is not common? Actually, ""N"" something ""R"" ""E"" S -> but S is invalid? We know S is not in the word.

We cannot use S.

So perhaps not.

With E at other positions.

For example, E at position 1: allowed? E can be at 1,2,4.

Then if E at 1, then word must be E ? ? ? ?

Then R must be at 3 or 5? Or at 1? But 1 is E, so R cannot be at 1. So R at 3 or 5.

N must be at 1? But 1 is E, so cannot have N at 1? So N must be at 2 or 3.

But position 1 is E.

So E at 1.

Possible: word E _ _ _ _

For N: can be position 2 or 3.

For R: can be position 3 or 5.

If N at 2: and R at 3: then E at 1, N at 2, R at 3 -> then positions 4 and 5 are new letters.

Word: E N R ? ? 

What words? ""ENROL"" but has O and L? But O is allowed? But the word has E at 1, N at 2, R at 3, O at 4, L at 5.

But N at 2: allowed? Yes.

R at 3: allowed? Yes (R cannot be at 2 or 4, but 3 is okay).

But we have O and L.

Is this a word? ""ENROL"" -> yes.

But note: we don't know if O and L are in the word.

Similarly, we could have other words.

But let's compare with ""MINER"" or ""LINER"".

Another structure: E at position 2.

Then word: ? E ? ? ?

E at position 2: allowed.

Then R possible positions: 1,3,5 (since cannot be 2 or 4? Wait, R cannot be at 2, but E is at 2? So no problem. R can be at 1,3,5)

N possible positions: 1,2,3? But 2 is E, so N can only be at 1 or 3.

So if E at 2:

Then N at 1 or 3.

R at 1,3,5? But if N at 1, then R can be at 3 or 5? Not at 1.

If N at 1: then R at 3 or 5.

Then word: N E ? ? R  or N E ? R ?  (if R at 3 or 5)

For example: N E R ? ? -> but R at 3? And E at 2.

Word: ""NERDY"" but we know D and Y? But also, we know S and T are invalid? S and T are out, but D and Y we don't know.

""Nerdy"" has positions: N1, E2, R3, D4, Y5.

Constraints: N at 1: allowed (N positions:1,2,3)
E at 2: allowed? Yes (since E must not be at 3 or 5? E cannot be at 3? From ""stern"", E at 3 got minus? And cannot be at 5 from ""crane"". But position 2 is new? Yes, so allowed.

But note: E was at 5 in ""crane"" and not at 3 in ""stern"", so position 2 is indeed available.

Similarly, R at 3: allowed? R cannot be at 2 or 4? 3 is allowed? Yes.

So ""NERDY"" is possible: letters N, E, R, D, Y -> no C,A,S,T -> valid.

But is Y a common letter? Not very, but possible.

Alternatively, N E and then position 3 and 4,5.

Examples: N E S S T -> but S and T are invalid.

Not possible.

Another: N E W E R -> two E's? and E not at 5? But position 5 is R? Actually, ""newer"" has E at 2 and 5? But E cannot be at 5? So if we guess ""NEWER"", E at 5 would be wrong.

But we have E at position 5 again? We should avoid since we know E is not at 5.

Therefore, ""NERDY"" or ""MINER"" or ""LINER"" or ""ENROL"".

We need to pick one.

Also, we must maximize information. So we want to test common unused letters.

Unused letters so far: all except C,A,S,T,R,N,E (and the ones used in guesses, but only c,a,n,e,r,s,t).

So guess1: c,r,a,n,e -> letters tested: C,R,A,N,E
guess2: s,t,e,r,n -> letters tested: S,T,E,R,N

So tested: A, C, E, N, R, S, T.

So unused: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want common letters: e.g., L, I, O, D, U, M, P, etc.

We can calculate frequency, but roughly.

For now, I think ""LINER"" is a good choice because it uses L and I, which are common vowels and consonants.

Similarly, ""MINER"" uses M and I.

""NERDY"" uses D and Y.

""ENROL"" uses O and L.

""LINER"" uses L and I.

We can choose ""LINER"" or ""MINER"".

Let me pick ""MINER"" because M is a common consonant.

""MINER"" structure:
Position 1: M
Position 2: I
Position 3: N
Position 4: E
Position 5: R

Constraints:
E at 4: allowed (E possible positions 1,2,4)
N at 3: allowed (N possible positions 1,2,3)
R at 5: allowed (R possible positions 1,3,5)

And M and I are new.

We haven't tested M or I.

Thus, a good guess.

We could also do ""LINER"" with L at 1 and I at 2.

But both are valid.

I think ""MINER"" is slightly better? Or not sure.

Another word: ""DINER"" -> 
Position 1: D
Position 2: I
Position 3: N
Position 4: E
Position 5: R? 

But E at 4: allowed? Yes.
N at 3: allowed? Yes.
R at 5: allowed? Yes.

And D and I are new.

Also valid.

But ""miner"" is more common? 

Since we have to choose, I'll go with ""miner"".

But note: we don't know if M is in the word. We are testing it.

If M is absent, we get an 'x' for M, which is useful.

Similarly, for I.

So I think ""MINER"" is a reasonable guess.

After research, I found that ""miner"" is an appropriate word to use.

So the third guess: ""MINER""

In the response format, we output the guess.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: R, N, and E are present but in incorrect positions (R not in position 2, N not in position 4, E not in position 5). C and A are absent.
- **Guess 2 (stern)**: E, R, and N are present but in incorrect positions (E not in position 3, R not in position 4, N not in position 5). S and T are absent.

Key deductions:
- The secret word contains R, N, and E (each at least once), and excludes C, A, S, T.
- Position constraints:
  - R can only be in positions 1, 3, or 5 (not 2 or 4).
  - N can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (not 4 or 5).
  - E can only be in positions 1, 2, or 4 (not 3 or 5).
- The word must be 5 letters, using only untested letters besides R, N, E (e.g., avoiding C, A, S, T).

For this guess, ""MINER"" is selected because:
- It includes R, N, E (required).
- It avoids forbidden letters (C, A, S, T).
- It places R, N, E in valid positions based on constraints:
  - R at position 5 (allowed).
  - N at position 3 (allowed).
  - E at position 4 (allowed).
- It introduces two new common letters (M and I) for testing.",Guess 3: miner -> FEEDBACK: M(x) I(x) N(-) E(✓) R(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,NEWER,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 I will choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 Let's go with ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E. These are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the secret word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the secret word)
 N: - (in the word but wrong position)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R, N, and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R is not in position 2, N is not in position 4, and E is not in position 5.
 - The letters C and A are not in the secret word at all.

 We also know that the secret word is 5 letters long.

 We need to make a second guess that:
   - Does not use C or A (since they are absent)
   - Includes R, N, E (but in different positions than in ""crane"")
   - We might also want to include other common letters to test.

 Since R, N, and E are in the word, we can try to place them in new positions.

 In ""crane"", the positions were:
   C (1), R (2), A (3), N (4), E (5)

 So for the next guess, we must avoid:
   - Putting R at position 2
   - Putting N at position 4
   - Putting E at position 5

 Also, we cannot use C or A.

 Let's think of words that have R, N, E and two other letters (which we don't know yet) and that place R, N, E in new positions.

 We can also consider that the word might have repeated letters? But typically in Wordle, words can have repeated letters, but it's less common. Since the feedback didn't indicate any duplicate, we assume no duplicates for now.

 We have three known letters: R, N, E. We need two more letters.

 We can try to use a word that has R, N, E and two new common consonants or vowels.

 Common consonants: T, S, L, etc.

 Let's try to form a word.

 Possibilities:

 We know R cannot be at position 2. So R can be at 1, 3, 4, or 5.
 Similarly, N cannot be at 4, so N can be at 1,2,3,5.
 E cannot be at 5, so E can be at 1,2,3,4.

 We also want to test new letters. Let's try to include 'T' and 'S' for example.

 Example words:

 - ""RENTS"": 
   R at position 1 (which is new for R, since previously R was at 2 -> now 1 is different)
   E at position 2 (previously E was at 5 -> now 2 is different)
   N at position 3 (previously N was at 4 -> now 3 is different)
   T and S are new.

 But note: we don't know if T and S are in the word. This is a way to test.

 Alternatively, ""ROTED"" is not a word. We need valid words.

 Another idea: ""INERT"" -> but we cannot use A and C, but I is allowed? However, we don't know about I. But note: we have to avoid A and C, but other vowels are possible.

 However, we have to be cautious: the word must be valid.

 Let me think of words that have R, N, E and two other letters.

 Some options:

 - ""RENEW"" -> but E is repeated? We don't know if repetition is allowed. Also, E is at position 2 and 4? But we know E is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. However, the feedback for the first guess only showed one E as present, but if there were two, it would have shown two minuses? Actually, the feedback only marks each letter that is present. If a letter is repeated and one is in the correct position, it would show a check for that one and a minus for the other? But in our case, we only had one E and it was marked as minus. So the word might have one E or more? We don't know.

 But to keep it simple, let's avoid duplicates for now.

 Another word: ""ROBIN"" -> but we don't have E? We must include E because we know it's in the word. So we need R, N, and E.

 How about ""DRIVE""? But we don't have N? We must include N because we know it's in the word.

 We must include R, N, and E.

 Let me try: ""RINSE"" -> 
   R at 1 (new position, previously 2 -> so allowed)
   I at 2 (new letter)
   N at 3 (previously at 4, now 3 -> allowed)
   S at 4 (new letter)
   E at 5 -> but wait, in the first guess E was at 5 and we got a minus meaning E is in the word but not at 5. So we cannot put E at 5 again? Actually, we can, but if we put E at 5 and the secret word has E at 5, then we would get a check. But the feedback said E is not at 5, so if we put E at 5 again, we know it will be wrong? Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at 5 again, it will still be wrong. So we should avoid putting E at 5.

 Therefore, in ""RINSE"", E is at 5 -> which is the same position as before. We know that position is wrong, so we should avoid that.

 We need a word that has E not at 5.

 How about ""RENEW""? But that has two E's. And the second E is at 5? So we have E at 2 and 5. We know E is not at 5, so the E at 5 would be wrong, but the E at 2 might be correct? But we don't know. Also, we are using two E's.

 Alternatively, ""URINE"" -> 
   U at 1 (new)
   R at 2 -> but wait, in the first guess R was at 2 and we got a minus meaning R is not at 2. So we cannot put R at 2 again? Actually, we can, but we know it's not at 2 so it will be minus again. We want to try R in a new position.

 So we should avoid putting R at 2, N at 4, and E at 5.

 Let me try to find a word that has:
   R at 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2)
   N at 1,2,3,5 (but not 4)
   E at 1,2,3,4 (but not 5)

 And the word must be 5 letters and not contain C or A.

 Example: ""RODEO"" -> no N and E? Not good.

 Another: ""HORDE"" -> 
   H at 1
   O at 2
   R at 3 -> allowed (since R was at 2, now 3 is new)
   D at 4
   E at 5 -> not allowed (because E cannot be at 5)

 So we avoid E at 5.

 How about ""HORNE""? Not a word.

 ""RENAL"" -> but A is not allowed? We know A is not in the word, so we cannot use A.

 ""RENAL"" has A -> invalid.

 ""REIGN"" -> 
   R at 1 -> allowed (not position 2)
   E at 2 -> allowed (not position 5)
   I at 3
   G at 4
   N at 5 -> allowed (not position 4)

 This seems good: 
   Positions: R(1), E(2), I(3), G(4), N(5)

 We are testing R at 1, E at 2, and N at 5. Also, we are introducing I and G.

 So let's go with ""REIGN"".

 But note: we are not using the fact that in the first word, we had R at 2 and now we are putting R at 1. Similarly, E was at 5 and now at 2, and N was at 4 and now at 5.

 This is a valid guess.

 Alternatively, we could try ""ROUTE"" -> but E at 5 is not allowed.

 Another option: ""SERIF"" -> 
   S at 1
   E at 2 -> allowed
   R at 3 -> allowed (not 2)
   I at 4
   F at 5

 But we are missing N? We must include N because we know it's in the word. So we cannot leave out N.

 Therefore, we must have R, N, and E in the guess.

 So ""REIGN"" is a valid word that includes R, N, E and avoids the forbidden positions.

 Let me check if ""REIGN"" is a valid English word: yes, it means to rule.

 So I will guess ""REIGN"".

 However, note that we are also trying to test new letters. We are testing I and G, which we haven't tried before.

 We might also consider ""NERDY"" -> 
   N at 1 -> allowed (not 4)
   E at 2 -> allowed (not 5)
   R at 3 -> allowed (not 2)
   D at 4
   Y at 5

 But we don't know about D and Y. And ""NERDY"" is a word.

 But we have to choose one. Let me compare:

 ""REIGN"" and ""NERDY""

 Both are valid. But ""REIGN"" uses G and I, while ""NERDY"" uses D and Y.

 We might want to use more common letters. G is more common than Y? And D is common.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ENTER"" -> 
   E at 1 -> allowed (not 5)
   N at 2 -> allowed (not 4)
   T at 3
   E at 4 -> but wait, we are repeating E? We don't know if the word has two E's. Also, we are putting E at 1 and 4. The feedback for the first guess only showed one E, but that doesn't mean there isn't two. However, we are using two E's and we only know one is present. This might be inefficient.

 So I think ""REIGN"" is a good choice.

 Let me see if there's a word that uses more common letters. For example, including T or S.

 How about ""RENTS"": 
   R at 1 -> allowed
   E at 2 -> allowed
   N at 3 -> allowed (previously at 4, now 3 is new)
   T at 4 -> but wait, N was at 4 in the first guess and we got a minus meaning N is not at 4. But now we are putting T at 4? That's fine. And S at 5.

 But E is at 2 and we are not repeating. Also, we are including T and S, which are common.

 However, we have to avoid putting E at 5? We are not. But note: we are putting N at 3 and E at 2, which are new positions.

 But what about the letter S? We don't know if it's in the word.

 Also, in ""RENTS"", we have R, E, N, T, S. That's five distinct letters? Yes.

 And the positions: 
   R:1 (new), E:2 (new), N:3 (new), T:4, S:5.

 We are testing T and S, which are common.

 But note: we are not using the fact that we know E is in the word? We are using E, so that's good.

 However, we are putting E at 2. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 Also, we are putting N at 3, which is a new position.

 But wait: in the first guess, we had R at 2 and now we are putting R at 1. That's good.

 So ""RENTS"" is also a good candidate.

 Which one to choose? 

 We want to maximize information. ""RENTS"" uses T and S, which are very common. ""REIGN"" uses I and G, which are less common.

 So ""RENTS"" might be better.

 But note: we are putting E at 2 and we don't know if that's correct. Also, we are putting N at 3 and T at 4 and S at 5.

 Alternatively, we can try ""STERN"": 
   S at 1
   T at 2
   E at 3 -> allowed (not 5)
   R at 4 -> allowed (not 2)
   N at 5 -> allowed (not 4)

 This also includes R, N, E and uses S and T.

 And the positions are all new for R, N, E.

 So ""STERN"" is another option.

 Let me compare:

 ""RENTS"": R1, E2, N3, T4, S5
 ""STERN"": S1, T2, E3, R4, N5

 Both are valid.

 But note: in ""STERN"", we are putting R at 4 and N at 5. We haven't tried these positions.

 Also, we are testing S and T in both.

 I think ""STERN"" might be slightly better because it places R and N in positions we haven't tested at all (4 and 5) and E in 3.

 But we are also testing S at 1 and T at 2.

 Alternatively, we can choose ""ROUSE"" -> but E at 5 is not allowed.

 After consideration, I think ""STERN"" is a good choice.

 However, we must avoid using A and C, and both ""RENTS"" and ""STERN"" are safe.

 I'll go with ""STERN"" because it uses common letters and tests new positions.

 But note: we have to make sure we don't use any forbidden letters. We know the secret word does not contain C or A. ""STERN"" has S, T, E, R, N -> no C or A. Good.

 So let's choose ""STERN"".

 Alternatively, we can choose ""RENEW"" but that has two E's and we don't know if that's necessary. Also, E at 5 is not allowed? Actually, ""RENEW"" has E at 2 and 5. We know E is not at 5, so the E at 5 would be a waste? But if the word has two E's, then we might get a minus for the E at 5. But we don't know. So it's better to avoid duplicates for now.

 Therefore, I choose ""STERN"".

 But wait, in the first guess, we had R at 2 and we got a minus. Now in ""STERN"", we are putting R at 4. Similarly, E was at 5 and now at 3, and N was at 4 and now at 5. So we are testing new positions.

 So the second guess: ""STERN""

 Let me write it: S T E R N

 But note: the word is ""stern"".

 We'll see the feedback.

 However, note: the feedback for the first guess had R, N, and E as present. So we are including them.

 So I'll go with ""STERN"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C and A are absent (x), so they can be excluded from future guesses.
- R, N, and E are present (-) but in incorrect positions. Specifically:
  - R cannot be in position 2.
  - N cannot be in position 4.
  - E cannot be in position 5.

For the second guess, I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Includes R, N, and E (since they are confirmed present).
2. Avoids C and A (confirmed absent).
3. Places R, N, and E in new positions (not 2, 4, and 5 respectively).
4. Tests new common letters (like S and T) for maximum information.

The word ""stern"" fits all criteria:
- Contains R (position 4), N (position 5), and E (position 3) — all in new positions.
- Uses S and T (common letters not yet tested).
- Avoids C and A.
- Is a valid English word.

This guess will help narrow down the positions of R, N, E and test S and T efficiently.

<guess>stern</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: stern -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) E(-) R(-) N(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: - (in word, wrong position)
  A: x (not in word)
  N: - (in word, wrong position)
  E: - (in word, wrong position)

From this, we know:
- The secret word contains R, N, E (each at least once).
- It does not contain C or A.
- R is not at position 2.
- N is not at position 4.
- E is not at position 5.

Guess 2: ""stern""
  S: x (not in word)
  T: x (not in word)
  E: - (in word, wrong position)
  R: - (in word, wrong position)
  N: - (in word, wrong position)

From this, we know:
- The secret word does not contain S or T.
- E is in the word but not at position 3 (since ""stern"" has E at position 3 and it got a minus).
- R is in the word but not at position 4 (since ""stern"" has R at position 4 and it got a minus).
- N is in the word but not at position 5 (since ""stern"" has N at position 5 and it got a minus).

We also know that E is not at position 5 (from guess1) and not at position 3 (from guess2). Similarly, R is not at position 2 (guess1) and not at position 4 (guess2). N is not at position 4 (guess1) and not at position 5 (guess2).

So summary:

Letters in the word: R, N, E (definitely at least once each)
Letters not in the word: C, A, S, T

We need to include R, N, E and two new letters.

Position constraints:

For R:
Cannot be at: 2 (from ""crane"") and 4 (from ""stern"")
So possible positions: 1, 3, 5

For N:
Cannot be at: 4 (from ""crane"") and 5 (from ""stern"")
So possible positions: 1, 2, 3

For E:
Cannot be at: 5 (from ""crane"") and 3 (from ""stern"")
So possible positions: 1, 2, 4

We have used up two guesses and have four left.

We need to choose a word that:
- Contains R, N, E
- Does not contain C, A, S, T
- Places R, N, E in positions that are still possible according to the constraints.

Also, we must introduce two new letters to test.

We have already tested: C, R, A, N, E, S, T (7 letters). So the remaining letters are many, but we need common ones.

We can use letters like: L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with R, N, E and two others.

We need to form a valid word.

We also have to consider the positions: R must be at 1,3,5; N at 1,2,3; E at 1,2,4.

We can try to fix the positions and look for words.

For example, let R be at position 3 (one of the options). Then what?

Possible word structures.

Let me think of words containing R, N, E.

Since E has only three possible positions (1,2,4), and R has three (1,3,5), and N has three (1,2,3), we need overlap.

We cannot have repeated letters? We don't know, but in the feedback so far, there has been no indication of duplicates. So we assume no duplicates for now.

So let E be at position 4. Then we have positions 1,2,3,5 to place R and N (and two other letters).

But E at 4: then positions:
1: ?
2: ?
3: ?
5: ?

N must be at 1,2,3 (since it cannot be at 4 or 5). Similarly, R must be at 1,3,5.

If E is at 4, then position 4 is taken by E.

Then for N: can be at 1,2,3.

For R: can be at 1,3,5.

But if R is at 3, and E at 4, then the word might be ? ? R E ?

But N must be in one of 1,2,3.

For example, if N at 1: then word: N ? R E ?

If N at 2: word: ? N R E ?

If N at 3: but R might also be at 3? But we assume distinct, so they can't both be at 3. So if E is at 4, position 3 must be either R or N? But we have to assign.

Actually, position 3 can be R or one of the new letters, and similarly.

But let's look for actual words.

Try E at position 4.

Possible words:

- ENDER: but has E at 2? And E at 5? We have E at 4, but also E at 2 and 5? That's multiple E's? But let's see structure.

We need E only once? We don't know.

But try: words like ""RENEW"" has E at 2 and 5 -> not good because E cannot be at 5.

Other words: How about ""LINER""? But we don't know if L and I are in the word.

""LINER"": 
Position 1: L
Position 2: I
Position 3: N
Position 4: E
Position 5: R

Check constraints:
R: at 5 -> allowed (since R can be at 1,3,5)
N: at 3 -> allowed (N can be at 1,2,3)
E: at 4 -> allowed (E can be at 1,2,4)

Also, L and I are new letters (not tested yet).

Also, no C,A,S,T -> good.

Is ""LINER"" a word? Yes, meaning an ocean liner or a person who lines.

So this is a valid guess.

But note: we have N at position 3 and E at 4. In ""crane"", N was at 4 (which is not allowed, but now N at 3) and E was at 5 (not allowed, but now E at 4).

Also, R was at 2 in ""crane"" (not allowed) and now R at 5.

So this word satisfies all position constraints.

We can have other options.

For example, with E at position 4, R at 5, and N at 1: then word structure: N ? ? E R

What words fit? e.g., ""NUDER""? Not a word. ""NEWER"" has two E's? E at 4, but E at 2? And E at 4? And E cannot be at 5? But ""NEWER"" has E at 2 and 5? Not good.

With E at position 4, R at 5, and N at 2: word: ? N ? E R -> e.g., ""INNER"" has two N's? Not good. Or ""MINER"": M at 1, I at 2? Then N at 3? But we need N at 2? ""MINER"" is M I N E R -> positions: N at 3, E at 4, R at 5. So N at 3 (allowed), E at 4 (allowed), R at 5 (allowed). Then the second letter is I? So word: M I N E R.

""M"" and ""I"" are new letters.

""MINER"" is a word.

Similarly, we could have ""LINER"" as above.

Another option: E at position 4, R at 3, and N somewhere? But R at 3: so positions 1,2 have letters? Then E at 4, then 5.

N can be at 1 or 2.

If N at 1: word: N ? R E ? -> e.g., ""NARES"" but has A -> invalid. ""NORES"" but O? And we don't have A, but O? Also, ""NORES"" is not common? Actually, ""N"" something ""R"" ""E"" S -> but S is invalid? We know S is not in the word.

We cannot use S.

So perhaps not.

With E at other positions.

For example, E at position 1: allowed? E can be at 1,2,4.

Then if E at 1, then word must be E ? ? ? ?

Then R must be at 3 or 5? Or at 1? But 1 is E, so R cannot be at 1. So R at 3 or 5.

N must be at 1? But 1 is E, so cannot have N at 1? So N must be at 2 or 3.

But position 1 is E.

So E at 1.

Possible: word E _ _ _ _

For N: can be position 2 or 3.

For R: can be position 3 or 5.

If N at 2: and R at 3: then E at 1, N at 2, R at 3 -> then positions 4 and 5 are new letters.

Word: E N R ? ? 

What words? ""ENROL"" but has O and L? But O is allowed? But the word has E at 1, N at 2, R at 3, O at 4, L at 5.

But N at 2: allowed? Yes.

R at 3: allowed? Yes (R cannot be at 2 or 4, but 3 is okay).

But we have O and L.

Is this a word? ""ENROL"" -> yes.

But note: we don't know if O and L are in the word.

Similarly, we could have other words.

But let's compare with ""MINER"" or ""LINER"".

Another structure: E at position 2.

Then word: ? E ? ? ?

E at position 2: allowed.

Then R possible positions: 1,3,5 (since cannot be 2 or 4? Wait, R cannot be at 2, but E is at 2? So no problem. R can be at 1,3,5)

N possible positions: 1,2,3? But 2 is E, so N can only be at 1 or 3.

So if E at 2:

Then N at 1 or 3.

R at 1,3,5? But if N at 1, then R can be at 3 or 5? Not at 1.

If N at 1: then R at 3 or 5.

Then word: N E ? ? R  or N E ? R ?  (if R at 3 or 5)

For example: N E R ? ? -> but R at 3? And E at 2.

Word: ""NERDY"" but we know D and Y? But also, we know S and T are invalid? S and T are out, but D and Y we don't know.

""Nerdy"" has positions: N1, E2, R3, D4, Y5.

Constraints: N at 1: allowed (N positions:1,2,3)
E at 2: allowed? Yes (since E must not be at 3 or 5? E cannot be at 3? From ""stern"", E at 3 got minus? And cannot be at 5 from ""crane"". But position 2 is new? Yes, so allowed.

But note: E was at 5 in ""crane"" and not at 3 in ""stern"", so position 2 is indeed available.

Similarly, R at 3: allowed? R cannot be at 2 or 4? 3 is allowed? Yes.

So ""NERDY"" is possible: letters N, E, R, D, Y -> no C,A,S,T -> valid.

But is Y a common letter? Not very, but possible.

Alternatively, N E and then position 3 and 4,5.

Examples: N E S S T -> but S and T are invalid.

Not possible.

Another: N E W E R -> two E's? and E not at 5? But position 5 is R? Actually, ""newer"" has E at 2 and 5? But E cannot be at 5? So if we guess ""NEWER"", E at 5 would be wrong.

But we have E at position 5 again? We should avoid since we know E is not at 5.

Therefore, ""NERDY"" or ""MINER"" or ""LINER"" or ""ENROL"".

We need to pick one.

Also, we must maximize information. So we want to test common unused letters.

Unused letters so far: all except C,A,S,T,R,N,E (and the ones used in guesses, but only c,a,n,e,r,s,t).

So guess1: c,r,a,n,e -> letters tested: C,R,A,N,E
guess2: s,t,e,r,n -> letters tested: S,T,E,R,N

So tested: A, C, E, N, R, S, T.

So unused: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want common letters: e.g., L, I, O, D, U, M, P, etc.

We can calculate frequency, but roughly.

For now, I think ""LINER"" is a good choice because it uses L and I, which are common vowels and consonants.

Similarly, ""MINER"" uses M and I.

""NERDY"" uses D and Y.

""ENROL"" uses O and L.

""LINER"" uses L and I.

We can choose ""LINER"" or ""MINER"".

Let me pick ""MINER"" because M is a common consonant.

""MINER"" structure:
Position 1: M
Position 2: I
Position 3: N
Position 4: E
Position 5: R

Constraints:
E at 4: allowed (E possible positions 1,2,4)
N at 3: allowed (N possible positions 1,2,3)
R at 5: allowed (R possible positions 1,3,5)

And M and I are new.

We haven't tested M or I.

Thus, a good guess.

We could also do ""LINER"" with L at 1 and I at 2.

But both are valid.

I think ""MINER"" is slightly better? Or not sure.

Another word: ""DINER"" -> 
Position 1: D
Position 2: I
Position 3: N
Position 4: E
Position 5: R? 

But E at 4: allowed? Yes.
N at 3: allowed? Yes.
R at 5: allowed? Yes.

And D and I are new.

Also valid.

But ""miner"" is more common? 

Since we have to choose, I'll go with ""miner"".

But note: we don't know if M is in the word. We are testing it.

If M is absent, we get an 'x' for M, which is useful.

Similarly, for I.

So I think ""MINER"" is a reasonable guess.

After research, I found that ""miner"" is an appropriate word to use.

So the third guess: ""MINER""

In the response format, we output the guess.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: R, N, and E are present but in incorrect positions (R not in position 2, N not in position 4, E not in position 5). C and A are absent.
- **Guess 2 (stern)**: E, R, and N are present but in incorrect positions (E not in position 3, R not in position 4, N not in position 5). S and T are absent.

Key deductions:
- The secret word contains R, N, and E (each at least once), and excludes C, A, S, T.
- Position constraints:
  - R can only be in positions 1, 3, or 5 (not 2 or 4).
  - N can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (not 4 or 5).
  - E can only be in positions 1, 2, or 4 (not 3 or 5).
- The word must be 5 letters, using only untested letters besides R, N, E (e.g., avoiding C, A, S, T).

For this guess, ""MINER"" is selected because:
- It includes R, N, E (required).
- It avoids forbidden letters (C, A, S, T).
- It places R, N, E in valid positions based on constraints:
  - R at position 5 (allowed).
  - N at position 3 (allowed).
  - E at position 4 (allowed).
- It introduces two new common letters (M and I) for testing.

If a letter is repeated and one is in the correct position, it would show a check for that one and a minus for the other? But in our case, we only had one E and it was marked as minus. So the word might have one E or more? We don\'t know.\n\n But to keep it simple, let\'s avoid duplicates for now.\n\n Another word: ""ROBIN"" -> but we don\'t have E?

So we cannot put E at 5 again? Actually, we can, but if we put E at 5 and the secret word has E at 5, then we would get a check. But the feedback said E is not at 5, so if we put E at 5 again, we know it will be wrong? Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at 5 again, it will still be wrong. So we should avoid putting E at 5.\n\n Therefore, in ""RINSE"", E is at 5 -> which is the same position as before. We know that position is wrong, so we should avoid that.\n\n We need a word that has E not at 5.\n\n How about ""RENEW""? But that has two E\'s. And the second E is at 5? So we have E at 2 and 5. We know E is not at 5, so the E at 5 would be wrong, but the E at 2 might be correct? But we don\'t know. Also, we are using two E\'s.\n\n Alternatively, ""URINE"" -> \n   U at 1 (new)\n   R at 2 -> but wait, in the first guess R was at 2 and we got a minus meaning R is not at 2. So we cannot put R at 2 again? Actually, we can, but we know it\'s not at 2 so it will be minus again. We want to try R in a new position.\n\n So we should avoid putting R at 2, N at 4, and E at 5.\n\n Let me try to find a word that has:\n   R at 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2)\n   N at 1,2,3,5 (but not 4)\n   E at 1,2,3,4 (but not 5)\n\n And the word must be 5 letters and not contain C or A.\n\n Example: ""RODEO"" -> no N and E? Not good.\n\n Another: ""HORDE"" -> \n   H at 1\n   O at 2\n   R at 3 -> allowed (since R was at 2, now 3 is new)\n   D at 4\n   E at 5 -> not allowed (because E cannot be at 5)\n\n So we avoid E at 5.\n\n How about ""HORNE""? Not a word.\n\n ""RENAL"" -> but A is not allowed? We know A is not in the word, so we cannot use A.\n\n ""RENAL"" has A -> invalid.\n\n ""REIGN"" -> \n   R at 1 -> allowed (not position 2)\n   E at 2 -> allowed (not position 5)\n   I at 3\n   G at 4\n   N at 5 -> allowed (not position 4)\n\n This seems good: \n   Positions: R(1), E(2), I(3), G(4), N(5)\n\n We are testing R at 1, E at 2, and N at 5. Also, we are introducing I and G.\n\n So let\'s go with ""REIGN"".\n\n But note: we are not using the fact that in the first word, we had R at 2 and now we are putting R at 1. Similarly, E was at 5 and now at 2, and N was at 4 and now at 5.\n\n This is a valid guess.\n\n Alternatively, we could try ""ROUTE"" -> but E at 5 is not allowed.\n\n Another option: ""SERIF"" -> \n   S at 1\n   E at 2 -> allowed\n   R at 3 -> allowed (not 2)\n   I at 4\n   F at 5\n\n But we are missing N? We must include N because we know it\'s in the word. So we cannot leave out N.\n\n Therefore, we must have R, N, and E in the guess.\n\n So ""REIGN"" is a valid word that includes R, N, E and avoids the forbidden positions.\n\n Let me check if ""REIGN"" is a valid English word: yes, it means to rule.\n\n So I will guess ""REIGN"".\n\n However, note that we are also trying to test new letters. We are testing I and G, which we haven\'t tried before.\n\n We might also consider ""NERDY"" -> \n   N at 1 -> allowed (not 4)\n   E at 2 -> allowed (not 5)\n   R at 3 -> allowed (not 2)\n   D at 4\n   Y at 5\n\n But we don\'t know about D and Y. And ""NERDY"" is a word.\n\n But we have to choose one. Let me compare:\n\n ""REIGN"" and ""NERDY""\n\n Both are valid. But ""REIGN"" uses G and I, while ""NERDY"" uses D and Y.\n\n We might want to use more common letters. G is more common than Y? And D is common.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""ENTER"" -> \n   E at 1 -> allowed (not 5)\n   N at 2 -> allowed (not 4)\n   T at 3\n   E at 4 -> but wait, we are repeating E? We don\'t know if the word has two E\'s. Also, we are putting E at 1 and 4. The feedback for the first guess only showed one E, but that doesn\'t mean there isn\'t two. However, we are using two E\'s and we only know one is present. This might be inefficient.\n\n So I think ""REIGN"" is a good choice.\n\n Let me see if there\'s a word that uses more common letters. For example, including T or S.\n\n How about ""RENTS"": \n   R at 1 -> allowed\n   E at 2 -> allowed\n   N at 3 -> allowed (previously at 4, now 3 is new)\n   T at 4 -> but wait, N was at 4 in the first guess and we got a minus meaning N is not at 4. But now we are putting T at 4? That\'s fine. And S at 5.\n\n But E is at 2 and we are not repeating. Also, we are including T and S, which are common.\n\n However, we have to avoid putting E at 5? We are not. But note: we are putting N at 3 and E at 2, which are new positions.\n\n But what about the letter S? We don\'t know if it\'s in the word.\n\n Also, in ""RENTS"", we have R, E, N, T, S. That\'s five distinct letters? Yes.\n\n And the positions: \n   R:1 (new), E:2 (new), N:3 (new), T:4, S:5.\n\n We are testing T and S, which are common.\n\n But note: we are not using the fact that we know E is in the word? We are using E, so that\'s good.\n\n However, we are putting E at 2. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing.\n\n Also, we are putting N at 3, which is a new position.\n\n But wait: in the first guess, we had R at 2 and now we are putting R at 1. That\'s good.\n\n So ""RENTS"" is also a good candidate.\n\n Which one to choose? \n\n We want to maximize information. ""RENTS"" uses T and S, which are very common. ""REIGN"" uses I and G, which are less common.\n\n So ""RENTS"" might be better.\n\n But note: we are putting E at 2 and we don\'t know if that\'s correct. Also, we are putting N at 3 and T at 4 and S at 5.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""STERN"": \n   S at 1\n   T at 2\n   E at 3 -> allowed (not 5)\n   R at 4 -> allowed (not 2)\n   N at 5 -> allowed (not 4)\n\n This also includes R, N, E and uses S and T.\n\n And the positions are all new for R, N, E.\n\n So ""STERN"" is another option.\n\n Let me compare:\n\n ""RENTS"": R1, E2, N3, T4, S5\n ""STERN"": S1, T2, E3, R4, N5\n\n Both are valid.\n\n But note: in ""STERN"", we are putting R at 4 and N at 5. We haven\'t tried these positions.\n\n Also, we are testing S and T in both.\n\n I think ""STERN"" might be slightly better because it places R and N in positions we haven\'t tested at all (4 and 5) and E in 3.\n\n But we are also testing S at 1 and T at 2.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose ""ROUSE"" -> but E at 5 is not allowed.\n\n After consideration, I think ""STERN"" is a good choice.\n\n However, we must avoid using A and C, and both ""RENTS"" and ""STERN"" are safe.\n\n I\'ll go with ""STERN"" because it uses common letters and tests new positions.\n\n But note: we have to make sure we don\'t use any forbidden letters. We know the secret word does not contain C or A. ""STERN"" has S, T, E, R, N -> no C or A. Good.\n\n So let\'s choose ""STERN"".\n\n Alternatively, we can choose ""RENEW"" but that has two E\'s and we don\'t know if that\'s necessary. Also, E at 5 is not allowed? Actually, ""RENEW"" has E at 2 and 5. We know E is not at 5, so the E at 5 would be a waste? But if the word has two E\'s, then we might get a minus for the E at 5. But we don\'t know. So it\'s better to avoid duplicates for now.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""STERN"".\n\n But wait, in the first guess, we had R at 2 and we got a minus. Now in ""STERN"", we are putting R at 4. Similarly, E was at 5 and now at 3, and N was at 4 and now at 5. So we are testing new positions.\n\n So the second guess: ""STERN""\n\n Let me write it: S T E R N\n\n But note: the word is ""stern"".\n\n We\'ll see the feedback.\n\n However, note: the feedback for the first guess had R, N, and E as present. So we are including them.\n\n So I\'ll go with ""STERN"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C and A are absent (x), so they can be excluded from future guesses.\n- R, N, and E are present (-) but in incorrect positions. Specifically:\n  - R cannot be in position 2.\n  - N cannot be in position 4.\n  - E cannot be in position 5.\n\nFor the second guess, I need a 5-letter word that:\n1. Includes R, N, and E (since they are confirmed present).\n2. Avoids C and A (confirmed absent).\n3. Places R, N, and E in new positions (not 2, 4, and 5 respectively).\n4. Tests new common letters (like S and T) for maximum information.\n\nThe word ""stern"" fits all criteria:\n- Contains R (position 4), N (position 5), and E (position 3) — all in new positions.\n- Uses S and T (common letters not yet tested).\n- Avoids C and A.\n- Is a valid English word.\n\nThis guess will help narrow down the positions of R, N, E and test S and T efficiently.\n\n<guess>stern</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: stern -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) E(-) R(-) N(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n  C: x (not in the word)\n  R: - (in word, wrong position)\n  A: x (not in word)\n  N: - (in word, wrong position)\n  E: - (in word, wrong position)\n\nFrom this, we know:\n- The secret word contains R, N, E (each at least once).\n- It does not contain C or A.\n- R is not at position 2.\n- N is not at position 4.\n- E is not at position 5.\n\nGuess 2: ""stern""\n  S: x (not in word)\n  T: x (not in word)\n  E: - (in word, wrong position)\n  R: - (in word, wrong position)\n  N: - (in word, wrong position)\n\nFrom this, we know:\n- The secret word does not contain S or T.\n- E is in the word but not at position 3 (since ""stern"" has E at position 3 and it got a minus).\n- R is in the word but not at position 4 (since ""stern"" has R at position 4 and it got a minus).\n- N is in the word but not at position 5 (since ""stern"" has N at position 5 and it got a minus).\n\nWe also know that E is not at position 5 (from guess1) and not at position 3 (from guess2). Similarly, R is not at position 2 (guess1) and not at position 4 (guess2). N is not at position 4 (guess1) and not at position 5 (guess2).\n\nSo summary:\n\nLetters in the word: R, N, E (definitely at least once each)\nLetters not in the word: C, A, S, T\n\nWe need to include R, N, E and two new letters.\n\nPosition constraints:\n\nFor R:\nCannot be at: 2 (from ""crane"") and 4 (from ""stern"")\nSo possible positions: 1, 3, 5\n\nFor N:\nCannot be at: 4 (from ""crane"") and 5 (from ""stern"")\nSo possible positions: 1, 2, 3\n\nFor E:\nCannot be at: 5 (from ""crane"") and 3 (from ""stern"")\nSo possible positions: 1, 2, 4\n\nWe have used up two guesses and have four left.\n\nWe need to choose a word that:\n- Contains R, N, E\n- Does not contain C, A, S, T\n- Places R, N, E in positions that are still possible according to the constraints.\n\nAlso, we must introduce two new letters to test.\n\nWe have already tested: C, R, A, N, E, S, T (7 letters). So the remaining letters are many, but we need common ones.\n\nWe can use letters like: L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.\n\nWe need a 5-letter word with R, N, E and two others.\n\nWe need to form a valid word.\n\nWe also have to consider the positions: R must be at 1,3,5; N at 1,2,3; E at 1,2,4.\n\nWe can try to fix the positions and look for words.\n\nFor example, let R be at position 3 (one of the options). Then what?\n\nPossible word structures.\n\nLet me think of words containing R, N, E.\n\nSince E has only three possible positions (1,2,4), and R has three (1,3,5), and N has three (1,2,3), we need overlap.\n\nWe cannot have repeated letters? We don\'t know, but in the feedback so far, there has been no indication of duplicates. So we assume no duplicates for now.\n\nSo let E be at position 4. Then we have positions 1,2,3,5 to place R and N (and two other letters).\n\nBut E at 4: then positions:\n1: ?\n2: ?\n3: ?\n5: ?\n\nN must be at 1,2,3 (since it cannot be at 4 or 5). Similarly, R must be at 1,3,5.\n\nIf E is at 4, then position 4 is taken by E.\n\nThen for N: can be at 1,2,3.\n\nFor R: can be at 1,3,5.\n\nBut if R is at 3, and E at 4, then the word might be ? ? R E ?\n\nBut N must be in one of 1,2,3.\n\nFor example, if N at 1: then word: N ? R E ?\n\nIf N at 2: word: ? N R E ?\n\nIf N at 3: but R might also be at 3? But we assume distinct, so they can\'t both be at 3. So if E is at 4, position 3 must be either R or N? But we have to assign.\n\nActually, position 3 can be R or one of the new letters, and similarly.\n\nBut let\'s look for actual words.\n\nTry E at position 4.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ENDER: but has E at 2? And E at 5? We have E at 4, but also E at 2 and 5? That\'s multiple E\'s? But let\'s see structure.\n\nWe need E only once? We don\'t know.\n\nBut try: words like ""RENEW"" has E at 2 and 5 -> not good because E cannot be at 5.\n\nOther words: How about ""LINER""? But we don\'t know if L and I are in the word.\n\n""LINER"": \nPosition 1: L\nPosition 2: I\nPosition 3: N\nPosition 4: E\nPosition 5: R\n\nCheck constraints:\nR: at 5 -> allowed (since R can be at 1,3,5)\nN: at 3 -> allowed (N can be at 1,2,3)\nE: at 4 -> allowed (E can be at 1,2,4)\n\nAlso, L and I are new letters (not tested yet).\n\nAlso, no C,A,S,T -> good.\n\nIs ""LINER"" a word? Yes, meaning an ocean liner or a person who lines.\n\nSo this is a valid guess.\n\nBut note: we have N at position 3 and E at 4. In ""crane"", N was at 4 (which is not allowed, but now N at 3) and E was at 5 (not allowed, but now E at 4).\n\nAlso, R was at 2 in ""crane"" (not allowed) and now R at 5.\n\nSo this word satisfies all position constraints.\n\nWe can have other options.\n\nFor example, with E at position 4, R at 5, and N at 1: then word structure: N ? ? E R\n\nWhat words fit? e.g., ""NUDER""? Not a word. ""NEWER"" has two E\'s? E at 4, but E at 2? And E at 4? And E cannot be at 5? But ""NEWER"" has E at 2 and 5? Not good.\n\nWith E at position 4, R at 5, and N at 2: word: ? N ? E R -> e.g., ""INNER"" has two N\'s? Not good. Or ""MINER"": M at 1, I at 2? Then N at 3? But we need N at 2? ""MINER"" is M I N E R -> positions: N at 3, E at 4, R at 5. So N at 3 (allowed), E at 4 (allowed), R at 5 (allowed). Then the second letter is I? So word: M I N E R.\n\n""M"" and ""I"" are new letters.\n\n""MINER"" is a word.\n\nSimilarly, we could have ""LINER"" as above.\n\nAnother option: E at position 4, R at 3, and N somewhere? But R at 3: so positions 1,2 have letters? Then E at 4, then 5.\n\nN can be at 1 or 2.\n\nIf N at 1: word: N ? R E ? -> e.g., ""NARES"" but has A -> invalid. ""NORES"" but O? And we don\'t have A, but O? Also, ""NORES"" is not common? Actually, ""N"" something ""R"" ""E"" S -> but S is invalid? We know S is not in the word.\n\nWe cannot use S.\n\nSo perhaps not.\n\nWith E at other positions.\n\nFor example, E at position 1: allowed? E can be at 1,2,4.\n\nThen if E at 1, then word must be E ? ? ? ?\n\nThen R must be at 3 or 5? Or at 1? But 1 is E, so R cannot be at 1. So R at 3 or 5.\n\nN must be at 1? But 1 is E, so cannot have N at 1? So N must be at 2 or 3.\n\nBut position 1 is E.\n\nSo E at 1.\n\nPossible: word E _ _ _ _\n\nFor N: can be position 2 or 3.\n\nFor R: can be position 3 or 5.\n\nIf N at 2: and R at 3: then E at 1, N at 2, R at 3 -> then positions 4 and 5 are new letters.\n\nWord: E N R ? ? \n\nWhat words? ""ENROL"" but has O and L? But O is allowed? But the word has E at 1, N at 2, R at 3, O at 4, L at 5.\n\nBut N at 2: allowed? Yes.\n\nR at 3: allowed? Yes (R cannot be at 2 or 4, but 3 is okay).\n\nBut we have O and L.\n\nIs this a word? ""ENROL"" -> yes.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if O and L are in the word.\n\nSimilarly, we could have other words.\n\nBut let\'s compare with ""MINER"" or ""LINER"".\n\nAnother structure: E at position 2.\n\nThen word: ? E ? ? ?\n\nE at position 2: allowed.\n\nThen R possible positions: 1,3,5 (since cannot be 2 or 4? Wait, R cannot be at 2, but E is at 2? So no problem. R can be at 1,3,5)\n\nN possible positions: 1,2,3? But 2 is E, so N can only be at 1 or 3.\n\nSo if E at 2:\n\nThen N at 1 or 3.\n\nR at 1,3,5? But if N at 1, then R can be at 3 or 5? Not at 1.\n\nIf N at 1: then R at 3 or 5.\n\nThen word: N E ? ? R  or N E ? R ?  (if R at 3 or 5)\n\nFor example: N E R ? ? -> but R at 3? And E at 2.\n\nWord: ""NERDY"" but we know D and Y? But also, we know S and T are invalid? S and T are out, but D and Y we don\'t know.\n\n""Nerdy"" has positions: N1, E2, R3, D4, Y5.\n\nConstraints: N at 1: allowed (N positions:1,2,3)\nE at 2: allowed? Yes (since E must not be at 3 or 5? E cannot be at 3? From ""stern"", E at 3 got minus? And cannot be at 5 from ""crane"". But position 2 is new? Yes, so allowed.\n\nBut note: E was at 5 in ""crane"" and not at 3 in ""stern"", so position 2 is indeed available.\n\nSimilarly, R at 3: allowed? R cannot be at 2 or 4? 3 is allowed? Yes.\n\nSo ""NERDY"" is possible: letters N, E, R, D, Y -> no C,A,S,T -> valid.\n\nBut is Y a common letter? Not very, but possible.\n\nAlternatively, N E and then position 3 and 4,5.\n\nExamples: N E S S T -> but S and T are invalid.\n\nNot possible.\n\nAnother: N E W E R -> two E\'s? and E not at 5? But position 5 is R? Actually, ""newer"" has E at 2 and 5? But E cannot be at 5? So if we guess ""NEWER"", E at 5 would be wrong.\n\nBut we have E at position 5 again? We should avoid since we know E is not at 5.\n\nTherefore, ""NERDY"" or ""MINER"" or ""LINER"" or ""ENROL"".\n\nWe need to pick one.\n\nAlso, we must maximize information. So we want to test common unused letters.\n\nUnused letters so far: all except C,A,S,T,R,N,E (and the ones used in guesses, but only c,a,n,e,r,s,t).\n\nSo guess1: c,r,a,n,e -> letters tested: C,R,A,N,E\nguess2: s,t,e,r,n -> letters tested: S,T,E,R,N\n\nSo tested: A, C, E, N, R, S, T.\n\nSo unused: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe want common letters: e.g., L, I, O, D, U, M, P, etc.\n\nWe can calculate frequency, but roughly.\n\nFor now, I think ""LINER"" is a good choice because it uses L and I, which are common vowels and consonants.\n\nSimilarly, ""MINER"" uses M and I.\n\n""NERDY"" uses D and Y.\n\n""ENROL"" uses O and L.\n\n""LINER"" uses L and I.\n\nWe can choose ""LINER"" or ""MINER"".\n\nLet me pick ""MINER"" because M is a common consonant.\n\n""MINER"" structure:\nPosition 1: M\nPosition 2: I\nPosition 3: N\nPosition 4: E\nPosition 5: R\n\nConstraints:\nE at 4: allowed (E possible positions 1,2,4)\nN at 3: allowed (N possible positions 1,2,3)\nR at 5: allowed (R possible positions 1,3,5)\n\nAnd M and I are new.\n\nWe haven\'t tested M or I.\n\nThus, a good guess.\n\nWe could also do ""LINER"" with L at 1 and I at 2.\n\nBut both are valid.\n\nI think ""MINER"" is slightly better? Or not sure.\n\nAnother word: ""DINER"" -> \nPosition 1: D\nPosition 2: I\nPosition 3: N\nPosition 4: E\nPosition 5: R? \n\nBut E at 4: allowed? Yes.\nN at 3: allowed? Yes.\nR at 5: allowed? Yes.\n\nAnd D and I are new.\n\nAlso valid.\n\nBut ""miner"" is more common? \n\nSince we have to choose, I\'ll go with ""miner"".\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if M is in the word. We are testing it.\n\nIf M is absent, we get an \'x\' for M, which is useful.\n\nSimilarly, for I.\n\nSo I think ""MINER"" is a reasonable guess.\n\nAfter research, I found that ""miner"" is an appropriate word to use.\n\nSo the third guess: ""MINER""\n\nIn the response format, we output the guess.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **Guess 1 (crane)**: R, N, and E are present but in incorrect positions (R not in position 2, N not in position 4, E not in position 5). C and A are absent.\n- **Guess 2 (stern)**: E, R, and N are present but in incorrect positions (E not in position 3, R not in position 4, N not in position 5). S and T are absent.\n\nKey deductions:\n- The secret word contains R, N, and E (each at least once), and excludes C, A, S, T.\n- Position constraints:\n  - R can only be in positions 1, 3, or 5 (not 2 or 4).\n  - N can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (not 4 or 5).\n  - E can only be in positions 1, 2, or 4 (not 3 or 5).\n- The word must be 5 letters, using only untested letters besides R, N, E (e.g., avoiding C, A, S, T).\n\nFor this guess, ""MINER"" is selected because:\n- It includes R, N, E (required).\n- It avoids forbidden letters (C, A, S, T).\n- It places R, N, E in valid positions based on constraints:\n  - R at position 5 (allowed).\n  - N at position 3 (allowed).\n  - E at position 4 (allowed).\n- It introduces two new common letters (M and I) for testing.\n\n<guess>miner</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: stern -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) E(-) R(-) N(-)\nGuess 3: miner -> FEEDBACK: M(x) I(x) N(-) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from the third guess ""miner"":
 M: x (not in the word)
 I: x (not in the word)
 N: - (in the word but wrong position)
 E: ✓ (correct position)
 R: ✓ (correct position)

 So, from ""miner"":
 - E is in the word and in the correct position: position 4.
 - R is in the word and in the correct position: position 5.
 - N is in the word but not in position 3 (since we got a minus for N at position 3).
 - M and I are not in the word.

 Also, from previous guesses, we know:
 - The secret word contains R, N, E (which we already knew) and now we know E is at position 4 and R is at position 5.
 - We also know that N is not at position 3 (from this guess) and not at position 4 (from guess1) and not at position 5 (from guess2). But position 5 is R, so that's consistent. Also, from guess1, N was not at 4, and now we know E is at 4, so that's good.

 Now, the secret word has:
   Position 4: E
   Position 5: R

 And N is in the word but not at position 3, and not at 4 or 5 (which are taken). So N must be at position 1 or 2.

 Also, we know from guess1 that R was not at position 2 (which we already knew, and now R is at 5, so that's fine) and from guess2 that R was not at 4 (and now we have R at 5, so also fine).

 We also know that E is at 4, so it cannot be at 1 or 2 (but we already knew E was not at 5, and now we know it's at 4).

 Now, the word structure is: _ _ _ E R

 We know N is at either position 1 or 2.

 We also have two more letters to fill: the first and second positions (if N is at 1, then position 2 is another letter; if N is at 2, then position 1 is another letter). And position 3 is still unknown, but we know it's not N (because in ""miner"" we had N at 3 and it was wrong) and not E or R (since they are at 4 and 5).

 Also, we know the word does not contain: C, A, S, T, M, I.

 We need to find a word that fits: _ _ _ E R, with N in position 1 or 2, and the other two positions (the remaining one and position 3) are filled with letters that are not C, A, S, T, M, I.

 We also know that the word must contain N (which we are placing at 1 or 2) and the other two letters.

 Let's consider the possibilities:

 Case 1: N at position 1
   Word: N _ _ E R
   Then position 2 and 3 are two other letters.

 Case 2: N at position 2
   Word: _ N _ E R
   Then position 1 and 3 are two other letters.

 We need to find valid English words that fit one of these patterns and use only letters not excluded.

 Excluded letters: A, C, I, M, S, T.

 We can use: B, D, E (but E is already placed), F, G, H, J, K, L, N (but we are using it), O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 But note: we have to use two more distinct letters? We don't know if there are duplicates, but so far no duplicates have been indicated.

 We can try to list possible words.

 First, case 1: N at 1 -> N _ _ E R

 Possible words:
   N U D E R -> ""NUDER"" (not a word)
   N A G E R -> but A is excluded -> invalid
   N O G E R -> ""NOGER"" (not a word)
   N U K E R -> ""NUKER"" (a word, meaning one that nukes)
   N I K E R -> but I is excluded -> invalid
   N O K E R -> ""NOKER"" (not a word)
   N O V E R -> ""NOVER"" (not a word)
   N E V E R -> but E at position 2? And we have E at 4. But ""NEVER"" has two E's? And E at position 2: but we don't know if E is duplicated? However, in the first guess, we had E and it was marked as present (but not at 5) and now we have E at 4. If there is another E, it might be possible. But in ""NEVER"", we have E at 2 and 4. So if we guess ""NEVER"", then:
        Position 1: N -> but we are considering N at 1, which is allowed? But we know N is not at 3, but we don't know about position 1. However, in this case, we are putting N at 1 and E at 2 and 4, and R at 5.

        But we have to check the feedback: 
          In ""miner"", we had E at 4 correct, so if there is an E at 2, that would be a new E? But the feedback for ""miner"" didn't show an extra E? Actually, in ""miner"", we had only one E (at position 4) and it was correct. The feedback for E was a check, meaning that E is at 4. The other letters: M, I, N, R. The N was present but wrong position, and R was correct. There was no indication of a second E? But if the word had two E's, then in ""miner"" we only tested one E (at 4) and it was correct, so the other E (if at 2) would not have been tested. So it's possible.

        However, we are not sure. But let's see if ""NEVER"" is a valid word? Yes.

        But we have to check the constraints for N: in ""NEVER"", N is at 1 -> allowed (since N can be at 1 or 2). 
        Also, E at 2: but we know E can be at 1,2,4? And we have E at 4 already. But the feedback from guess1 and guess2 didn't rule out E at 2? 
          - In guess1, E was at 5 and got minus -> so E is not at 5, but 2 is different.
          - In guess2, E was at 3 and got minus -> so E is not at 3, but 2 is different.
          So E at 2 is allowed.

        However, we have two E's? The secret word might have two E's? We don't know.

        But note: in the first guess ""crane"", we had one E and it was marked as present (minus) meaning there is at least one E. Now we have E at 4 (correct) and if we put E at 2, that would be a second E? But we don't know if the word has two E's.

        We can try ""NEVER"", but we are not forced to. We can avoid duplicates if possible.

        But let's see other words.

   Other words: ""NAKER"" -> not a word, and A is excluded.
   ""NAB E R"" -> A excluded.

   How about ""NUDER""? Not a word.

   ""NUKER"": N at 1, U at 2, K at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> valid word? Yes, meaning one that nukes.

   And U and K are not excluded.

   So ""NUKER"" is a possibility.

   Also, ""NONER"" -> not a word.

   ""NOYER"" -> not a word.

   ""NOHOW"" -> not ending with ER.

   So ""NUKER"" is one.

 Case 2: N at position 2 -> _ N _ E R

 Possible words:
   B N E E R -> ""BNEER"" not a word.
   D N E E R -> ""DNEER"" not a word.
   F N E E R -> not a word.
   G N E E R -> ""GNEER"" not a word.
   H N E E R -> not a word.
   J N E E R -> not a word.
   K N E E R -> not a word.
   L N E E R -> not a word.
   O N E E R -> ""ONEER"" not a word.
   P N E E R -> not a word.
   Q N E E R -> not a word.
   U N E E R -> not a word.
   V N E E R -> not a word.
   W N E E R -> not a word.
   X N E E R -> not a word.
   Y N E E R -> not a word.
   Z N E E R -> not a word.

   What about ""ONCER""? But C is excluded.

   How about ""UNDER""? 
        U at 1, N at 2, D at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> ""UNDER""
        This is a valid word.

        Constraints: 
          N at 2: allowed (N can be at 1,2,3 -> 2 is allowed)
          E at 4: correct (we know)
          R at 5: correct (we know)
          U and D are new letters.

        And no excluded letters.

        So ""UNDER"" is a valid word.

   Also, ""UNGER"": U at 1, N at 2, G at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> ""UNGER"" is a surname? But it's a valid word? Actually, it might be accepted as a proper noun, but in Wordle, common words are used. ""UNGER"" is not common. 

   ""UNPER""? Not a word.

   ""UNMET""? But ends with T? T is excluded.

   ""UNZIP""? But Z and P, but ends with P? We need ER at the end.

   So ""UNDER"" is a common word.

   Also, ""OWNER"": O at 1, W at 2, N at 3? But we need N at 2? ""OWNER"" has N at 3? So not.

   ""INNER"": I is excluded and N at 2? ""INNER"" has I at 1, N at 2, N at 3? Duplicate N? And I is excluded.

   ""HONER"": H at 1, O at 2, N at 3? But we need N at 2? So not.

   So the main candidates are:
        Case 1: ""NUKER"" (N at 1)
        Case 2: ""UNDER"" (N at 2)

 We have two possibilities.

 We need to choose one.

 We can also consider if there are other words.

 Another word for case 1: ""NAZER""? Not a word.

 For case 2: ""UNGER"" might be accepted? But ""UNDER"" is better.

 Also, ""ONERY"" -> but not ending with ER.

 So between ""NUKER"" and ""UNDER"", which one to choose?

 We know that in the word, we have E at 4 and R at 5, and N at either 1 or 2.

 We also know that in the first guess, we had N at 4 (which is now E) and it was present but wrong position. In the second guess, N at 5 (which is now R) and it was present but wrong position. In the third guess, N at 3 and it was present but wrong position.

 So N has been tried at positions 3,4,5 and all were wrong. So it must be at 1 or 2.

 Now, we can choose a word that tests one of these.

 But note: we have only two possibilities? Actually, no, because the other letters matter.

 However, we can choose a word that will help us distinguish.

 But we have two candidates: ""NUKER"" and ""UNDER"". They are both possible.

 We can also think of other words? For example, ""FJORD"" but doesn't end with ER.

 We must end with ER.

 Another word: ""OUNCE"" but not ending with ER.

 So let's list all possible words:

 For pattern _ _ _ E R:

 With N at 1: 
   N _ _ E R -> we have ""NUKER"" (and maybe others? ""NAKER"" not a word, ""NIXER"" has I, ""NOYER"" not, ""NUBER"" not, ""NUDER"" not, ""NUMER"" not, ""NURSE"" has S -> invalid, ""NUTTY"" not, etc.) So only ""NUKER"" seems common.

 With N at 2:
   _ N _ E R -> we have ""UNDER"", and also ""ANGER"" but A excluded, ""INKER"" I excluded, ""ONCER"" C excluded, ""OWNER"" has N at 3? No, ""OWNER"" is O W N E R -> N at 3, not 2. 
   ""HONEY"" not ending with ER.

   ""JNANA"" not.

   So only ""UNDER"" is common.

   Also, ""UNLED"" not ending with ER.

   ""UNMET"" has T.

   So ""UNDER"" is the main candidate for N at 2.

   Another: ""UNWED"" not.

   ""UNZIP"" not.

   So we have two candidates: ""NUKER"" and ""UNDER"".

 We can choose one to guess. Since we have two possibilities, we can pick one arbitrarily, but we have to make a guess.

 Alternatively, we can think of a word that tests both possibilities? But we have to fill the entire word.

 We can guess ""NUKER"" and if it's not, then ""UNDER"" must be the word.

 But we have to use one guess.

 Let's see the frequency: ""UNDER"" is more common than ""NUKER"". So perhaps ""UNDER"" is more likely.

 But we don't know.

 We can also consider that in ""miner"", we had N at 3 and it was present but wrong. If the word were ""NUKER"", then N is at 1, which is a new position. Similarly, for ""UNDER"", N is at 2.

 We have no information about position 1 or 2 for N.

 So we can choose ""UNDER"" because it's a more common word.

 But note: we have to avoid excluded letters. Both are safe.

 I'll go with ""UNDER"".

 But wait: in ""UNDER"", we have U at 1 and D at 3. We haven't tested U or D.

 Similarly, in ""NUKER"", we have U at 2 and K at 3.

 We are testing new letters in both.

 But ""UNDER"" is a very common word.

 So the fourth guess: ""UNDER""

 If it's not, then we try ""NUKER"" next.

 But we have two guesses left? We are at guess 4, and we have 6 tries.

 So we can do that.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that tests the presence of U? But we are forced to use one of these patterns.

 I think ""UNDER"" is a good guess.

 So let's go with ""UNDER"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: R, N, E are present (but misplaced); C and A are absent.
- **Guess 2 (stern)**: E, R, N are present (but misplaced); S and T are absent.
- **Guess 3 (miner)**: 
  - E (position 4) and R (position 5) are correct (✓).
  - N is present but misplaced (-), so it cannot be in position 3.
  - M and I are absent (x).

### Key Deductions:
1. **Fixed positions**: 
   - Position 4 must be **E**.
   - Position 5 must be **R**.
   - The word ends with **ER**.
2. **N constraints**: 
   - N is in the word but cannot be in positions 3, 4 (from Guess 1), or 5 (from Guess 2). Thus, N must be in position **1 or 2**.
3. **Absent letters**: C, A, S, T, M, I (cannot appear in the word).
4. **Word structure**: `_ _ _ E R` (with N in position 1 or 2).

### Analysis for Next Guess:
- The secret word must be 5 letters, ending with ""ER"", with N at position 1 or 2, and no excluded letters.
- Possible candidates:
  - **N at position 1**: Words like **NUKER** (N _ _ E R). However, ""NUKER"" is uncommon.
  - **N at position 2**: Words like **UNDER** (_ N _ E R), which is a common word and fits all constraints.
- **UNDER** is chosen because:
  - It places N in position 2 (valid, as N cannot be in 3/4/5).
  - It uses new letters (U, D) to test their presence.
  - It adheres to all feedback and excluded letters.

<guess>under</guess>",under,"We have feedback from the third guess ""miner"":
 M: x (not in the word)
 I: x (not in the word)
 N: - (in the word but wrong position)
 E: ✓ (correct position)
 R: ✓ (correct position)

 So, from ""miner"":
 - E is in the word and in the correct position: position 4.
 - R is in the word and in the correct position: position 5.
 - N is in the word but not in position 3 (since we got a minus for N at position 3).
 - M and I are not in the word.

 Also, from previous guesses, we know:
 - The secret word contains R, N, E (which we already knew) and now we know E is at position 4 and R is at position 5.
 - We also know that N is not at position 3 (from this guess) and not at position 4 (from guess1) and not at position 5 (from guess2). But position 5 is R, so that's consistent. Also, from guess1, N was not at 4, and now we know E is at 4, so that's good.

 Now, the secret word has:
   Position 4: E
   Position 5: R

 And N is in the word but not at position 3, and not at 4 or 5 (which are taken). So N must be at position 1 or 2.

 Also, we know from guess1 that R was not at position 2 (which we already knew, and now R is at 5, so that's fine) and from guess2 that R was not at 4 (and now we have R at 5, so also fine).

 We also know that E is at 4, so it cannot be at 1 or 2 (but we already knew E was not at 5, and now we know it's at 4).

 Now, the word structure is: _ _ _ E R

 We know N is at either position 1 or 2.

 We also have two more letters to fill: the first and second positions (if N is at 1, then position 2 is another letter; if N is at 2, then position 1 is another letter). And position 3 is still unknown, but we know it's not N (because in ""miner"" we had N at 3 and it was wrong) and not E or R (since they are at 4 and 5).

 Also, we know the word does not contain: C, A, S, T, M, I.

 We need to find a word that fits: _ _ _ E R, with N in position 1 or 2, and the other two positions (the remaining one and position 3) are filled with letters that are not C, A, S, T, M, I.

 We also know that the word must contain N (which we are placing at 1 or 2) and the other two letters.

 Let's consider the possibilities:

 Case 1: N at position 1
   Word: N _ _ E R
   Then position 2 and 3 are two other letters.

 Case 2: N at position 2
   Word: _ N _ E R
   Then position 1 and 3 are two other letters.

 We need to find valid English words that fit one of these patterns and use only letters not excluded.

 Excluded letters: A, C, I, M, S, T.

 We can use: B, D, E (but E is already placed), F, G, H, J, K, L, N (but we are using it), O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 But note: we have to use two more distinct letters? We don't know if there are duplicates, but so far no duplicates have been indicated.

 We can try to list possible words.

 First, case 1: N at 1 -> N _ _ E R

 Possible words:
   N U D E R -> ""NUDER"" (not a word)
   N A G E R -> but A is excluded -> invalid
   N O G E R -> ""NOGER"" (not a word)
   N U K E R -> ""NUKER"" (a word, meaning one that nukes)
   N I K E R -> but I is excluded -> invalid
   N O K E R -> ""NOKER"" (not a word)
   N O V E R -> ""NOVER"" (not a word)
   N E V E R -> but E at position 2? And we have E at 4. But ""NEVER"" has two E's? And E at position 2: but we don't know if E is duplicated? However, in the first guess, we had E and it was marked as present (but not at 5) and now we have E at 4. If there is another E, it might be possible. But in ""NEVER"", we have E at 2 and 4. So if we guess ""NEVER"", then:
        Position 1: N -> but we are considering N at 1, which is allowed? But we know N is not at 3, but we don't know about position 1. However, in this case, we are putting N at 1 and E at 2 and 4, and R at 5.

        But we have to check the feedback: 
          In ""miner"", we had E at 4 correct, so if there is an E at 2, that would be a new E? But the feedback for ""miner"" didn't show an extra E? Actually, in ""miner"", we had only one E (at position 4) and it was correct. The feedback for E was a check, meaning that E is at 4. The other letters: M, I, N, R. The N was present but wrong position, and R was correct. There was no indication of a second E? But if the word had two E's, then in ""miner"" we only tested one E (at 4) and it was correct, so the other E (if at 2) would not have been tested. So it's possible.

        However, we are not sure. But let's see if ""NEVER"" is a valid word? Yes.

        But we have to check the constraints for N: in ""NEVER"", N is at 1 -> allowed (since N can be at 1 or 2). 
        Also, E at 2: but we know E can be at 1,2,4? And we have E at 4 already. But the feedback from guess1 and guess2 didn't rule out E at 2? 
          - In guess1, E was at 5 and got minus -> so E is not at 5, but 2 is different.
          - In guess2, E was at 3 and got minus -> so E is not at 3, but 2 is different.
          So E at 2 is allowed.

        However, we have two E's? The secret word might have two E's? We don't know.

        But note: in the first guess ""crane"", we had one E and it was marked as present (minus) meaning there is at least one E. Now we have E at 4 (correct) and if we put E at 2, that would be a second E? But we don't know if the word has two E's.

        We can try ""NEVER"", but we are not forced to. We can avoid duplicates if possible.

        But let's see other words.

   Other words: ""NAKER"" -> not a word, and A is excluded.
   ""NAB E R"" -> A excluded.

   How about ""NUDER""? Not a word.

   ""NUKER"": N at 1, U at 2, K at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> valid word? Yes, meaning one that nukes.

   And U and K are not excluded.

   So ""NUKER"" is a possibility.

   Also, ""NONER"" -> not a word.

   ""NOYER"" -> not a word.

   ""NOHOW"" -> not ending with ER.

   So ""NUKER"" is one.

 Case 2: N at position 2 -> _ N _ E R

 Possible words:
   B N E E R -> ""BNEER"" not a word.
   D N E E R -> ""DNEER"" not a word.
   F N E E R -> not a word.
   G N E E R -> ""GNEER"" not a word.
   H N E E R -> not a word.
   J N E E R -> not a word.
   K N E E R -> not a word.
   L N E E R -> not a word.
   O N E E R -> ""ONEER"" not a word.
   P N E E R -> not a word.
   Q N E E R -> not a word.
   U N E E R -> not a word.
   V N E E R -> not a word.
   W N E E R -> not a word.
   X N E E R -> not a word.
   Y N E E R -> not a word.
   Z N E E R -> not a word.

   What about ""ONCER""? But C is excluded.

   How about ""UNDER""? 
        U at 1, N at 2, D at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> ""UNDER""
        This is a valid word.

        Constraints: 
          N at 2: allowed (N can be at 1,2,3 -> 2 is allowed)
          E at 4: correct (we know)
          R at 5: correct (we know)
          U and D are new letters.

        And no excluded letters.

        So ""UNDER"" is a valid word.

   Also, ""UNGER"": U at 1, N at 2, G at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> ""UNGER"" is a surname? But it's a valid word? Actually, it might be accepted as a proper noun, but in Wordle, common words are used. ""UNGER"" is not common. 

   ""UNPER""? Not a word.

   ""UNMET""? But ends with T? T is excluded.

   ""UNZIP""? But Z and P, but ends with P? We need ER at the end.

   So ""UNDER"" is a common word.

   Also, ""OWNER"": O at 1, W at 2, N at 3? But we need N at 2? ""OWNER"" has N at 3? So not.

   ""INNER"": I is excluded and N at 2? ""INNER"" has I at 1, N at 2, N at 3? Duplicate N? And I is excluded.

   ""HONER"": H at 1, O at 2, N at 3? But we need N at 2? So not.

   So the main candidates are:
        Case 1: ""NUKER"" (N at 1)
        Case 2: ""UNDER"" (N at 2)

 We have two possibilities.

 We need to choose one.

 We can also consider if there are other words.

 Another word for case 1: ""NAZER""? Not a word.

 For case 2: ""UNGER"" might be accepted? But ""UNDER"" is better.

 Also, ""ONERY"" -> but not ending with ER.

 So between ""NUKER"" and ""UNDER"", which one to choose?

 We know that in the word, we have E at 4 and R at 5, and N at either 1 or 2.

 We also know that in the first guess, we had N at 4 (which is now E) and it was present but wrong position. In the second guess, N at 5 (which is now R) and it was present but wrong position. In the third guess, N at 3 and it was present but wrong position.

 So N has been tried at positions 3,4,5 and all were wrong. So it must be at 1 or 2.

 Now, we can choose a word that tests one of these.

 But note: we have only two possibilities? Actually, no, because the other letters matter.

 However, we can choose a word that will help us distinguish.

 But we have two candidates: ""NUKER"" and ""UNDER"". They are both possible.

 We can also think of other words? For example, ""FJORD"" but doesn't end with ER.

 We must end with ER.

 Another word: ""OUNCE"" but not ending with ER.

 So let's list all possible words:

 For pattern _ _ _ E R:

 With N at 1: 
   N _ _ E R -> we have ""NUKER"" (and maybe others? ""NAKER"" not a word, ""NIXER"" has I, ""NOYER"" not, ""NUBER"" not, ""NUDER"" not, ""NUMER"" not, ""NURSE"" has S -> invalid, ""NUTTY"" not, etc.) So only ""NUKER"" seems common.

 With N at 2:
   _ N _ E R -> we have ""UNDER"", and also ""ANGER"" but A excluded, ""INKER"" I excluded, ""ONCER"" C excluded, ""OWNER"" has N at 3? No, ""OWNER"" is O W N E R -> N at 3, not 2. 
   ""HONEY"" not ending with ER.

   ""JNANA"" not.

   So only ""UNDER"" is common.

   Also, ""UNLED"" not ending with ER.

   ""UNMET"" has T.

   So ""UNDER"" is the main candidate for N at 2.

   Another: ""UNWED"" not.

   ""UNZIP"" not.

   So we have two candidates: ""NUKER"" and ""UNDER"".

 We can choose one to guess. Since we have two possibilities, we can pick one arbitrarily, but we have to make a guess.

 Alternatively, we can think of a word that tests both possibilities? But we have to fill the entire word.

 We can guess ""NUKER"" and if it's not, then ""UNDER"" must be the word.

 But we have to use one guess.

 Let's see the frequency: ""UNDER"" is more common than ""NUKER"". So perhaps ""UNDER"" is more likely.

 But we don't know.

 We can also consider that in ""miner"", we had N at 3 and it was present but wrong. If the word were ""NUKER"", then N is at 1, which is a new position. Similarly, for ""UNDER"", N is at 2.

 We have no information about position 1 or 2 for N.

 So we can choose ""UNDER"" because it's a more common word.

 But note: we have to avoid excluded letters. Both are safe.

 I'll go with ""UNDER"".

 But wait: in ""UNDER"", we have U at 1 and D at 3. We haven't tested U or D.

 Similarly, in ""NUKER"", we have U at 2 and K at 3.

 We are testing new letters in both.

 But ""UNDER"" is a very common word.

 So the fourth guess: ""UNDER""

 If it's not, then we try ""NUKER"" next.

 But we have two guesses left? We are at guess 4, and we have 6 tries.

 So we can do that.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that tests the presence of U? But we are forced to use one of these patterns.

 I think ""UNDER"" is a good guess.

 So let's go with ""UNDER"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: R, N, E are present (but misplaced); C and A are absent.
- **Guess 2 (stern)**: E, R, N are present (but misplaced); S and T are absent.
- **Guess 3 (miner)**: 
  - E (position 4) and R (position 5) are correct (✓).
  - N is present but misplaced (-), so it cannot be in position 3.
  - M and I are absent (x).

### Key Deductions:
1. **Fixed positions**: 
   - Position 4 must be **E**.
   - Position 5 must be **R**.
   - The word ends with **ER**.
2. **N constraints**: 
   - N is in the word but cannot be in positions 3, 4 (from Guess 1), or 5 (from Guess 2). Thus, N must be in position **1 or 2**.
3. **Absent letters**: C, A, S, T, M, I (cannot appear in the word).
4. **Word structure**: `_ _ _ E R` (with N in position 1 or 2).

### Analysis for Next Guess:
- The secret word must be 5 letters, ending with ""ER"", with N at position 1 or 2, and no excluded letters.
- Possible candidates:
  - **N at position 1**: Words like **NUKER** (N _ _ E R). However, ""NUKER"" is uncommon.
  - **N at position 2**: Words like **UNDER** (_ N _ E R), which is a common word and fits all constraints.
- **UNDER** is chosen because:
  - It places N in position 2 (valid, as N cannot be in 3/4/5).
  - It uses new letters (U, D) to test their presence.
  - It adheres to all feedback and excluded letters.",Guess 4: under -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) D(x) E(✓) R(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,5,NEWER,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 I will choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 Let's go with ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E. These are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the secret word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the secret word)
 N: - (in the word but wrong position)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R, N, and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R is not in position 2, N is not in position 4, and E is not in position 5.
 - The letters C and A are not in the secret word at all.

 We also know that the secret word is 5 letters long.

 We need to make a second guess that:
   - Does not use C or A (since they are absent)
   - Includes R, N, E (but in different positions than in ""crane"")
   - We might also want to include other common letters to test.

 Since R, N, and E are in the word, we can try to place them in new positions.

 In ""crane"", the positions were:
   C (1), R (2), A (3), N (4), E (5)

 So for the next guess, we must avoid:
   - Putting R at position 2
   - Putting N at position 4
   - Putting E at position 5

 Also, we cannot use C or A.

 Let's think of words that have R, N, E and two other letters (which we don't know yet) and that place R, N, E in new positions.

 We can also consider that the word might have repeated letters? But typically in Wordle, words can have repeated letters, but it's less common. Since the feedback didn't indicate any duplicate, we assume no duplicates for now.

 We have three known letters: R, N, E. We need two more letters.

 We can try to use a word that has R, N, E and two new common consonants or vowels.

 Common consonants: T, S, L, etc.

 Let's try to form a word.

 Possibilities:

 We know R cannot be at position 2. So R can be at 1, 3, 4, or 5.
 Similarly, N cannot be at 4, so N can be at 1,2,3,5.
 E cannot be at 5, so E can be at 1,2,3,4.

 We also want to test new letters. Let's try to include 'T' and 'S' for example.

 Example words:

 - ""RENTS"": 
   R at position 1 (which is new for R, since previously R was at 2 -> now 1 is different)
   E at position 2 (previously E was at 5 -> now 2 is different)
   N at position 3 (previously N was at 4 -> now 3 is different)
   T and S are new.

 But note: we don't know if T and S are in the word. This is a way to test.

 Alternatively, ""ROTED"" is not a word. We need valid words.

 Another idea: ""INERT"" -> but we cannot use A and C, but I is allowed? However, we don't know about I. But note: we have to avoid A and C, but other vowels are possible.

 However, we have to be cautious: the word must be valid.

 Let me think of words that have R, N, E and two other letters.

 Some options:

 - ""RENEW"" -> but E is repeated? We don't know if repetition is allowed. Also, E is at position 2 and 4? But we know E is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. However, the feedback for the first guess only showed one E as present, but if there were two, it would have shown two minuses? Actually, the feedback only marks each letter that is present. If a letter is repeated and one is in the correct position, it would show a check for that one and a minus for the other? But in our case, we only had one E and it was marked as minus. So the word might have one E or more? We don't know.

 But to keep it simple, let's avoid duplicates for now.

 Another word: ""ROBIN"" -> but we don't have E? We must include E because we know it's in the word. So we need R, N, and E.

 How about ""DRIVE""? But we don't have N? We must include N because we know it's in the word.

 We must include R, N, and E.

 Let me try: ""RINSE"" -> 
   R at 1 (new position, previously 2 -> so allowed)
   I at 2 (new letter)
   N at 3 (previously at 4, now 3 -> allowed)
   S at 4 (new letter)
   E at 5 -> but wait, in the first guess E was at 5 and we got a minus meaning E is in the word but not at 5. So we cannot put E at 5 again? Actually, we can, but if we put E at 5 and the secret word has E at 5, then we would get a check. But the feedback said E is not at 5, so if we put E at 5 again, we know it will be wrong? Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at 5 again, it will still be wrong. So we should avoid putting E at 5.

 Therefore, in ""RINSE"", E is at 5 -> which is the same position as before. We know that position is wrong, so we should avoid that.

 We need a word that has E not at 5.

 How about ""RENEW""? But that has two E's. And the second E is at 5? So we have E at 2 and 5. We know E is not at 5, so the E at 5 would be wrong, but the E at 2 might be correct? But we don't know. Also, we are using two E's.

 Alternatively, ""URINE"" -> 
   U at 1 (new)
   R at 2 -> but wait, in the first guess R was at 2 and we got a minus meaning R is not at 2. So we cannot put R at 2 again? Actually, we can, but we know it's not at 2 so it will be minus again. We want to try R in a new position.

 So we should avoid putting R at 2, N at 4, and E at 5.

 Let me try to find a word that has:
   R at 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2)
   N at 1,2,3,5 (but not 4)
   E at 1,2,3,4 (but not 5)

 And the word must be 5 letters and not contain C or A.

 Example: ""RODEO"" -> no N and E? Not good.

 Another: ""HORDE"" -> 
   H at 1
   O at 2
   R at 3 -> allowed (since R was at 2, now 3 is new)
   D at 4
   E at 5 -> not allowed (because E cannot be at 5)

 So we avoid E at 5.

 How about ""HORNE""? Not a word.

 ""RENAL"" -> but A is not allowed? We know A is not in the word, so we cannot use A.

 ""RENAL"" has A -> invalid.

 ""REIGN"" -> 
   R at 1 -> allowed (not position 2)
   E at 2 -> allowed (not position 5)
   I at 3
   G at 4
   N at 5 -> allowed (not position 4)

 This seems good: 
   Positions: R(1), E(2), I(3), G(4), N(5)

 We are testing R at 1, E at 2, and N at 5. Also, we are introducing I and G.

 So let's go with ""REIGN"".

 But note: we are not using the fact that in the first word, we had R at 2 and now we are putting R at 1. Similarly, E was at 5 and now at 2, and N was at 4 and now at 5.

 This is a valid guess.

 Alternatively, we could try ""ROUTE"" -> but E at 5 is not allowed.

 Another option: ""SERIF"" -> 
   S at 1
   E at 2 -> allowed
   R at 3 -> allowed (not 2)
   I at 4
   F at 5

 But we are missing N? We must include N because we know it's in the word. So we cannot leave out N.

 Therefore, we must have R, N, and E in the guess.

 So ""REIGN"" is a valid word that includes R, N, E and avoids the forbidden positions.

 Let me check if ""REIGN"" is a valid English word: yes, it means to rule.

 So I will guess ""REIGN"".

 However, note that we are also trying to test new letters. We are testing I and G, which we haven't tried before.

 We might also consider ""NERDY"" -> 
   N at 1 -> allowed (not 4)
   E at 2 -> allowed (not 5)
   R at 3 -> allowed (not 2)
   D at 4
   Y at 5

 But we don't know about D and Y. And ""NERDY"" is a word.

 But we have to choose one. Let me compare:

 ""REIGN"" and ""NERDY""

 Both are valid. But ""REIGN"" uses G and I, while ""NERDY"" uses D and Y.

 We might want to use more common letters. G is more common than Y? And D is common.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ENTER"" -> 
   E at 1 -> allowed (not 5)
   N at 2 -> allowed (not 4)
   T at 3
   E at 4 -> but wait, we are repeating E? We don't know if the word has two E's. Also, we are putting E at 1 and 4. The feedback for the first guess only showed one E, but that doesn't mean there isn't two. However, we are using two E's and we only know one is present. This might be inefficient.

 So I think ""REIGN"" is a good choice.

 Let me see if there's a word that uses more common letters. For example, including T or S.

 How about ""RENTS"": 
   R at 1 -> allowed
   E at 2 -> allowed
   N at 3 -> allowed (previously at 4, now 3 is new)
   T at 4 -> but wait, N was at 4 in the first guess and we got a minus meaning N is not at 4. But now we are putting T at 4? That's fine. And S at 5.

 But E is at 2 and we are not repeating. Also, we are including T and S, which are common.

 However, we have to avoid putting E at 5? We are not. But note: we are putting N at 3 and E at 2, which are new positions.

 But what about the letter S? We don't know if it's in the word.

 Also, in ""RENTS"", we have R, E, N, T, S. That's five distinct letters? Yes.

 And the positions: 
   R:1 (new), E:2 (new), N:3 (new), T:4, S:5.

 We are testing T and S, which are common.

 But note: we are not using the fact that we know E is in the word? We are using E, so that's good.

 However, we are putting E at 2. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 Also, we are putting N at 3, which is a new position.

 But wait: in the first guess, we had R at 2 and now we are putting R at 1. That's good.

 So ""RENTS"" is also a good candidate.

 Which one to choose? 

 We want to maximize information. ""RENTS"" uses T and S, which are very common. ""REIGN"" uses I and G, which are less common.

 So ""RENTS"" might be better.

 But note: we are putting E at 2 and we don't know if that's correct. Also, we are putting N at 3 and T at 4 and S at 5.

 Alternatively, we can try ""STERN"": 
   S at 1
   T at 2
   E at 3 -> allowed (not 5)
   R at 4 -> allowed (not 2)
   N at 5 -> allowed (not 4)

 This also includes R, N, E and uses S and T.

 And the positions are all new for R, N, E.

 So ""STERN"" is another option.

 Let me compare:

 ""RENTS"": R1, E2, N3, T4, S5
 ""STERN"": S1, T2, E3, R4, N5

 Both are valid.

 But note: in ""STERN"", we are putting R at 4 and N at 5. We haven't tried these positions.

 Also, we are testing S and T in both.

 I think ""STERN"" might be slightly better because it places R and N in positions we haven't tested at all (4 and 5) and E in 3.

 But we are also testing S at 1 and T at 2.

 Alternatively, we can choose ""ROUSE"" -> but E at 5 is not allowed.

 After consideration, I think ""STERN"" is a good choice.

 However, we must avoid using A and C, and both ""RENTS"" and ""STERN"" are safe.

 I'll go with ""STERN"" because it uses common letters and tests new positions.

 But note: we have to make sure we don't use any forbidden letters. We know the secret word does not contain C or A. ""STERN"" has S, T, E, R, N -> no C or A. Good.

 So let's choose ""STERN"".

 Alternatively, we can choose ""RENEW"" but that has two E's and we don't know if that's necessary. Also, E at 5 is not allowed? Actually, ""RENEW"" has E at 2 and 5. We know E is not at 5, so the E at 5 would be a waste? But if the word has two E's, then we might get a minus for the E at 5. But we don't know. So it's better to avoid duplicates for now.

 Therefore, I choose ""STERN"".

 But wait, in the first guess, we had R at 2 and we got a minus. Now in ""STERN"", we are putting R at 4. Similarly, E was at 5 and now at 3, and N was at 4 and now at 5. So we are testing new positions.

 So the second guess: ""STERN""

 Let me write it: S T E R N

 But note: the word is ""stern"".

 We'll see the feedback.

 However, note: the feedback for the first guess had R, N, and E as present. So we are including them.

 So I'll go with ""STERN"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C and A are absent (x), so they can be excluded from future guesses.
- R, N, and E are present (-) but in incorrect positions. Specifically:
  - R cannot be in position 2.
  - N cannot be in position 4.
  - E cannot be in position 5.

For the second guess, I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Includes R, N, and E (since they are confirmed present).
2. Avoids C and A (confirmed absent).
3. Places R, N, and E in new positions (not 2, 4, and 5 respectively).
4. Tests new common letters (like S and T) for maximum information.

The word ""stern"" fits all criteria:
- Contains R (position 4), N (position 5), and E (position 3) — all in new positions.
- Uses S and T (common letters not yet tested).
- Avoids C and A.
- Is a valid English word.

This guess will help narrow down the positions of R, N, E and test S and T efficiently.

<guess>stern</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: stern -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) E(-) R(-) N(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: - (in word, wrong position)
  A: x (not in word)
  N: - (in word, wrong position)
  E: - (in word, wrong position)

From this, we know:
- The secret word contains R, N, E (each at least once).
- It does not contain C or A.
- R is not at position 2.
- N is not at position 4.
- E is not at position 5.

Guess 2: ""stern""
  S: x (not in word)
  T: x (not in word)
  E: - (in word, wrong position)
  R: - (in word, wrong position)
  N: - (in word, wrong position)

From this, we know:
- The secret word does not contain S or T.
- E is in the word but not at position 3 (since ""stern"" has E at position 3 and it got a minus).
- R is in the word but not at position 4 (since ""stern"" has R at position 4 and it got a minus).
- N is in the word but not at position 5 (since ""stern"" has N at position 5 and it got a minus).

We also know that E is not at position 5 (from guess1) and not at position 3 (from guess2). Similarly, R is not at position 2 (guess1) and not at position 4 (guess2). N is not at position 4 (guess1) and not at position 5 (guess2).

So summary:

Letters in the word: R, N, E (definitely at least once each)
Letters not in the word: C, A, S, T

We need to include R, N, E and two new letters.

Position constraints:

For R:
Cannot be at: 2 (from ""crane"") and 4 (from ""stern"")
So possible positions: 1, 3, 5

For N:
Cannot be at: 4 (from ""crane"") and 5 (from ""stern"")
So possible positions: 1, 2, 3

For E:
Cannot be at: 5 (from ""crane"") and 3 (from ""stern"")
So possible positions: 1, 2, 4

We have used up two guesses and have four left.

We need to choose a word that:
- Contains R, N, E
- Does not contain C, A, S, T
- Places R, N, E in positions that are still possible according to the constraints.

Also, we must introduce two new letters to test.

We have already tested: C, R, A, N, E, S, T (7 letters). So the remaining letters are many, but we need common ones.

We can use letters like: L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with R, N, E and two others.

We need to form a valid word.

We also have to consider the positions: R must be at 1,3,5; N at 1,2,3; E at 1,2,4.

We can try to fix the positions and look for words.

For example, let R be at position 3 (one of the options). Then what?

Possible word structures.

Let me think of words containing R, N, E.

Since E has only three possible positions (1,2,4), and R has three (1,3,5), and N has three (1,2,3), we need overlap.

We cannot have repeated letters? We don't know, but in the feedback so far, there has been no indication of duplicates. So we assume no duplicates for now.

So let E be at position 4. Then we have positions 1,2,3,5 to place R and N (and two other letters).

But E at 4: then positions:
1: ?
2: ?
3: ?
5: ?

N must be at 1,2,3 (since it cannot be at 4 or 5). Similarly, R must be at 1,3,5.

If E is at 4, then position 4 is taken by E.

Then for N: can be at 1,2,3.

For R: can be at 1,3,5.

But if R is at 3, and E at 4, then the word might be ? ? R E ?

But N must be in one of 1,2,3.

For example, if N at 1: then word: N ? R E ?

If N at 2: word: ? N R E ?

If N at 3: but R might also be at 3? But we assume distinct, so they can't both be at 3. So if E is at 4, position 3 must be either R or N? But we have to assign.

Actually, position 3 can be R or one of the new letters, and similarly.

But let's look for actual words.

Try E at position 4.

Possible words:

- ENDER: but has E at 2? And E at 5? We have E at 4, but also E at 2 and 5? That's multiple E's? But let's see structure.

We need E only once? We don't know.

But try: words like ""RENEW"" has E at 2 and 5 -> not good because E cannot be at 5.

Other words: How about ""LINER""? But we don't know if L and I are in the word.

""LINER"": 
Position 1: L
Position 2: I
Position 3: N
Position 4: E
Position 5: R

Check constraints:
R: at 5 -> allowed (since R can be at 1,3,5)
N: at 3 -> allowed (N can be at 1,2,3)
E: at 4 -> allowed (E can be at 1,2,4)

Also, L and I are new letters (not tested yet).

Also, no C,A,S,T -> good.

Is ""LINER"" a word? Yes, meaning an ocean liner or a person who lines.

So this is a valid guess.

But note: we have N at position 3 and E at 4. In ""crane"", N was at 4 (which is not allowed, but now N at 3) and E was at 5 (not allowed, but now E at 4).

Also, R was at 2 in ""crane"" (not allowed) and now R at 5.

So this word satisfies all position constraints.

We can have other options.

For example, with E at position 4, R at 5, and N at 1: then word structure: N ? ? E R

What words fit? e.g., ""NUDER""? Not a word. ""NEWER"" has two E's? E at 4, but E at 2? And E at 4? And E cannot be at 5? But ""NEWER"" has E at 2 and 5? Not good.

With E at position 4, R at 5, and N at 2: word: ? N ? E R -> e.g., ""INNER"" has two N's? Not good. Or ""MINER"": M at 1, I at 2? Then N at 3? But we need N at 2? ""MINER"" is M I N E R -> positions: N at 3, E at 4, R at 5. So N at 3 (allowed), E at 4 (allowed), R at 5 (allowed). Then the second letter is I? So word: M I N E R.

""M"" and ""I"" are new letters.

""MINER"" is a word.

Similarly, we could have ""LINER"" as above.

Another option: E at position 4, R at 3, and N somewhere? But R at 3: so positions 1,2 have letters? Then E at 4, then 5.

N can be at 1 or 2.

If N at 1: word: N ? R E ? -> e.g., ""NARES"" but has A -> invalid. ""NORES"" but O? And we don't have A, but O? Also, ""NORES"" is not common? Actually, ""N"" something ""R"" ""E"" S -> but S is invalid? We know S is not in the word.

We cannot use S.

So perhaps not.

With E at other positions.

For example, E at position 1: allowed? E can be at 1,2,4.

Then if E at 1, then word must be E ? ? ? ?

Then R must be at 3 or 5? Or at 1? But 1 is E, so R cannot be at 1. So R at 3 or 5.

N must be at 1? But 1 is E, so cannot have N at 1? So N must be at 2 or 3.

But position 1 is E.

So E at 1.

Possible: word E _ _ _ _

For N: can be position 2 or 3.

For R: can be position 3 or 5.

If N at 2: and R at 3: then E at 1, N at 2, R at 3 -> then positions 4 and 5 are new letters.

Word: E N R ? ? 

What words? ""ENROL"" but has O and L? But O is allowed? But the word has E at 1, N at 2, R at 3, O at 4, L at 5.

But N at 2: allowed? Yes.

R at 3: allowed? Yes (R cannot be at 2 or 4, but 3 is okay).

But we have O and L.

Is this a word? ""ENROL"" -> yes.

But note: we don't know if O and L are in the word.

Similarly, we could have other words.

But let's compare with ""MINER"" or ""LINER"".

Another structure: E at position 2.

Then word: ? E ? ? ?

E at position 2: allowed.

Then R possible positions: 1,3,5 (since cannot be 2 or 4? Wait, R cannot be at 2, but E is at 2? So no problem. R can be at 1,3,5)

N possible positions: 1,2,3? But 2 is E, so N can only be at 1 or 3.

So if E at 2:

Then N at 1 or 3.

R at 1,3,5? But if N at 1, then R can be at 3 or 5? Not at 1.

If N at 1: then R at 3 or 5.

Then word: N E ? ? R  or N E ? R ?  (if R at 3 or 5)

For example: N E R ? ? -> but R at 3? And E at 2.

Word: ""NERDY"" but we know D and Y? But also, we know S and T are invalid? S and T are out, but D and Y we don't know.

""Nerdy"" has positions: N1, E2, R3, D4, Y5.

Constraints: N at 1: allowed (N positions:1,2,3)
E at 2: allowed? Yes (since E must not be at 3 or 5? E cannot be at 3? From ""stern"", E at 3 got minus? And cannot be at 5 from ""crane"". But position 2 is new? Yes, so allowed.

But note: E was at 5 in ""crane"" and not at 3 in ""stern"", so position 2 is indeed available.

Similarly, R at 3: allowed? R cannot be at 2 or 4? 3 is allowed? Yes.

So ""NERDY"" is possible: letters N, E, R, D, Y -> no C,A,S,T -> valid.

But is Y a common letter? Not very, but possible.

Alternatively, N E and then position 3 and 4,5.

Examples: N E S S T -> but S and T are invalid.

Not possible.

Another: N E W E R -> two E's? and E not at 5? But position 5 is R? Actually, ""newer"" has E at 2 and 5? But E cannot be at 5? So if we guess ""NEWER"", E at 5 would be wrong.

But we have E at position 5 again? We should avoid since we know E is not at 5.

Therefore, ""NERDY"" or ""MINER"" or ""LINER"" or ""ENROL"".

We need to pick one.

Also, we must maximize information. So we want to test common unused letters.

Unused letters so far: all except C,A,S,T,R,N,E (and the ones used in guesses, but only c,a,n,e,r,s,t).

So guess1: c,r,a,n,e -> letters tested: C,R,A,N,E
guess2: s,t,e,r,n -> letters tested: S,T,E,R,N

So tested: A, C, E, N, R, S, T.

So unused: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want common letters: e.g., L, I, O, D, U, M, P, etc.

We can calculate frequency, but roughly.

For now, I think ""LINER"" is a good choice because it uses L and I, which are common vowels and consonants.

Similarly, ""MINER"" uses M and I.

""NERDY"" uses D and Y.

""ENROL"" uses O and L.

""LINER"" uses L and I.

We can choose ""LINER"" or ""MINER"".

Let me pick ""MINER"" because M is a common consonant.

""MINER"" structure:
Position 1: M
Position 2: I
Position 3: N
Position 4: E
Position 5: R

Constraints:
E at 4: allowed (E possible positions 1,2,4)
N at 3: allowed (N possible positions 1,2,3)
R at 5: allowed (R possible positions 1,3,5)

And M and I are new.

We haven't tested M or I.

Thus, a good guess.

We could also do ""LINER"" with L at 1 and I at 2.

But both are valid.

I think ""MINER"" is slightly better? Or not sure.

Another word: ""DINER"" -> 
Position 1: D
Position 2: I
Position 3: N
Position 4: E
Position 5: R? 

But E at 4: allowed? Yes.
N at 3: allowed? Yes.
R at 5: allowed? Yes.

And D and I are new.

Also valid.

But ""miner"" is more common? 

Since we have to choose, I'll go with ""miner"".

But note: we don't know if M is in the word. We are testing it.

If M is absent, we get an 'x' for M, which is useful.

Similarly, for I.

So I think ""MINER"" is a reasonable guess.

After research, I found that ""miner"" is an appropriate word to use.

So the third guess: ""MINER""

In the response format, we output the guess.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: R, N, and E are present but in incorrect positions (R not in position 2, N not in position 4, E not in position 5). C and A are absent.
- **Guess 2 (stern)**: E, R, and N are present but in incorrect positions (E not in position 3, R not in position 4, N not in position 5). S and T are absent.

Key deductions:
- The secret word contains R, N, and E (each at least once), and excludes C, A, S, T.
- Position constraints:
  - R can only be in positions 1, 3, or 5 (not 2 or 4).
  - N can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (not 4 or 5).
  - E can only be in positions 1, 2, or 4 (not 3 or 5).
- The word must be 5 letters, using only untested letters besides R, N, E (e.g., avoiding C, A, S, T).

For this guess, ""MINER"" is selected because:
- It includes R, N, E (required).
- It avoids forbidden letters (C, A, S, T).
- It places R, N, E in valid positions based on constraints:
  - R at position 5 (allowed).
  - N at position 3 (allowed).
  - E at position 4 (allowed).
- It introduces two new common letters (M and I) for testing.

Guess 3: miner -> FEEDBACK: M(x) I(x) N(-) E(✓) R(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the third guess ""miner"":
 M: x (not in the word)
 I: x (not in the word)
 N: - (in the word but wrong position)
 E: ✓ (correct position)
 R: ✓ (correct position)

 So, from ""miner"":
 - E is in the word and in the correct position: position 4.
 - R is in the word and in the correct position: position 5.
 - N is in the word but not in position 3 (since we got a minus for N at position 3).
 - M and I are not in the word.

 Also, from previous guesses, we know:
 - The secret word contains R, N, E (which we already knew) and now we know E is at position 4 and R is at position 5.
 - We also know that N is not at position 3 (from this guess) and not at position 4 (from guess1) and not at position 5 (from guess2). But position 5 is R, so that's consistent. Also, from guess1, N was not at 4, and now we know E is at 4, so that's good.

 Now, the secret word has:
   Position 4: E
   Position 5: R

 And N is in the word but not at position 3, and not at 4 or 5 (which are taken). So N must be at position 1 or 2.

 Also, we know from guess1 that R was not at position 2 (which we already knew, and now R is at 5, so that's fine) and from guess2 that R was not at 4 (and now we have R at 5, so also fine).

 We also know that E is at 4, so it cannot be at 1 or 2 (but we already knew E was not at 5, and now we know it's at 4).

 Now, the word structure is: _ _ _ E R

 We know N is at either position 1 or 2.

 We also have two more letters to fill: the first and second positions (if N is at 1, then position 2 is another letter; if N is at 2, then position 1 is another letter). And position 3 is still unknown, but we know it's not N (because in ""miner"" we had N at 3 and it was wrong) and not E or R (since they are at 4 and 5).

 Also, we know the word does not contain: C, A, S, T, M, I.

 We need to find a word that fits: _ _ _ E R, with N in position 1 or 2, and the other two positions (the remaining one and position 3) are filled with letters that are not C, A, S, T, M, I.

 We also know that the word must contain N (which we are placing at 1 or 2) and the other two letters.

 Let's consider the possibilities:

 Case 1: N at position 1
   Word: N _ _ E R
   Then position 2 and 3 are two other letters.

 Case 2: N at position 2
   Word: _ N _ E R
   Then position 1 and 3 are two other letters.

 We need to find valid English words that fit one of these patterns and use only letters not excluded.

 Excluded letters: A, C, I, M, S, T.

 We can use: B, D, E (but E is already placed), F, G, H, J, K, L, N (but we are using it), O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 But note: we have to use two more distinct letters? We don't know if there are duplicates, but so far no duplicates have been indicated.

 We can try to list possible words.

 First, case 1: N at 1 -> N _ _ E R

 Possible words:
   N U D E R -> ""NUDER"" (not a word)
   N A G E R -> but A is excluded -> invalid
   N O G E R -> ""NOGER"" (not a word)
   N U K E R -> ""NUKER"" (a word, meaning one that nukes)
   N I K E R -> but I is excluded -> invalid
   N O K E R -> ""NOKER"" (not a word)
   N O V E R -> ""NOVER"" (not a word)
   N E V E R -> but E at position 2? And we have E at 4. But ""NEVER"" has two E's? And E at position 2: but we don't know if E is duplicated? However, in the first guess, we had E and it was marked as present (but not at 5) and now we have E at 4. If there is another E, it might be possible. But in ""NEVER"", we have E at 2 and 4. So if we guess ""NEVER"", then:
        Position 1: N -> but we are considering N at 1, which is allowed? But we know N is not at 3, but we don't know about position 1. However, in this case, we are putting N at 1 and E at 2 and 4, and R at 5.

        But we have to check the feedback: 
          In ""miner"", we had E at 4 correct, so if there is an E at 2, that would be a new E? But the feedback for ""miner"" didn't show an extra E? Actually, in ""miner"", we had only one E (at position 4) and it was correct. The feedback for E was a check, meaning that E is at 4. The other letters: M, I, N, R. The N was present but wrong position, and R was correct. There was no indication of a second E? But if the word had two E's, then in ""miner"" we only tested one E (at 4) and it was correct, so the other E (if at 2) would not have been tested. So it's possible.

        However, we are not sure. But let's see if ""NEVER"" is a valid word? Yes.

        But we have to check the constraints for N: in ""NEVER"", N is at 1 -> allowed (since N can be at 1 or 2). 
        Also, E at 2: but we know E can be at 1,2,4? And we have E at 4 already. But the feedback from guess1 and guess2 didn't rule out E at 2? 
          - In guess1, E was at 5 and got minus -> so E is not at 5, but 2 is different.
          - In guess2, E was at 3 and got minus -> so E is not at 3, but 2 is different.
          So E at 2 is allowed.

        However, we have two E's? The secret word might have two E's? We don't know.

        But note: in the first guess ""crane"", we had one E and it was marked as present (minus) meaning there is at least one E. Now we have E at 4 (correct) and if we put E at 2, that would be a second E? But we don't know if the word has two E's.

        We can try ""NEVER"", but we are not forced to. We can avoid duplicates if possible.

        But let's see other words.

   Other words: ""NAKER"" -> not a word, and A is excluded.
   ""NAB E R"" -> A excluded.

   How about ""NUDER""? Not a word.

   ""NUKER"": N at 1, U at 2, K at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> valid word? Yes, meaning one that nukes.

   And U and K are not excluded.

   So ""NUKER"" is a possibility.

   Also, ""NONER"" -> not a word.

   ""NOYER"" -> not a word.

   ""NOHOW"" -> not ending with ER.

   So ""NUKER"" is one.

 Case 2: N at position 2 -> _ N _ E R

 Possible words:
   B N E E R -> ""BNEER"" not a word.
   D N E E R -> ""DNEER"" not a word.
   F N E E R -> not a word.
   G N E E R -> ""GNEER"" not a word.
   H N E E R -> not a word.
   J N E E R -> not a word.
   K N E E R -> not a word.
   L N E E R -> not a word.
   O N E E R -> ""ONEER"" not a word.
   P N E E R -> not a word.
   Q N E E R -> not a word.
   U N E E R -> not a word.
   V N E E R -> not a word.
   W N E E R -> not a word.
   X N E E R -> not a word.
   Y N E E R -> not a word.
   Z N E E R -> not a word.

   What about ""ONCER""? But C is excluded.

   How about ""UNDER""? 
        U at 1, N at 2, D at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> ""UNDER""
        This is a valid word.

        Constraints: 
          N at 2: allowed (N can be at 1,2,3 -> 2 is allowed)
          E at 4: correct (we know)
          R at 5: correct (we know)
          U and D are new letters.

        And no excluded letters.

        So ""UNDER"" is a valid word.

   Also, ""UNGER"": U at 1, N at 2, G at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> ""UNGER"" is a surname? But it's a valid word? Actually, it might be accepted as a proper noun, but in Wordle, common words are used. ""UNGER"" is not common. 

   ""UNPER""? Not a word.

   ""UNMET""? But ends with T? T is excluded.

   ""UNZIP""? But Z and P, but ends with P? We need ER at the end.

   So ""UNDER"" is a common word.

   Also, ""OWNER"": O at 1, W at 2, N at 3? But we need N at 2? ""OWNER"" has N at 3? So not.

   ""INNER"": I is excluded and N at 2? ""INNER"" has I at 1, N at 2, N at 3? Duplicate N? And I is excluded.

   ""HONER"": H at 1, O at 2, N at 3? But we need N at 2? So not.

   So the main candidates are:
        Case 1: ""NUKER"" (N at 1)
        Case 2: ""UNDER"" (N at 2)

 We have two possibilities.

 We need to choose one.

 We can also consider if there are other words.

 Another word for case 1: ""NAZER""? Not a word.

 For case 2: ""UNGER"" might be accepted? But ""UNDER"" is better.

 Also, ""ONERY"" -> but not ending with ER.

 So between ""NUKER"" and ""UNDER"", which one to choose?

 We know that in the word, we have E at 4 and R at 5, and N at either 1 or 2.

 We also know that in the first guess, we had N at 4 (which is now E) and it was present but wrong position. In the second guess, N at 5 (which is now R) and it was present but wrong position. In the third guess, N at 3 and it was present but wrong position.

 So N has been tried at positions 3,4,5 and all were wrong. So it must be at 1 or 2.

 Now, we can choose a word that tests one of these.

 But note: we have only two possibilities? Actually, no, because the other letters matter.

 However, we can choose a word that will help us distinguish.

 But we have two candidates: ""NUKER"" and ""UNDER"". They are both possible.

 We can also think of other words? For example, ""FJORD"" but doesn't end with ER.

 We must end with ER.

 Another word: ""OUNCE"" but not ending with ER.

 So let's list all possible words:

 For pattern _ _ _ E R:

 With N at 1: 
   N _ _ E R -> we have ""NUKER"" (and maybe others? ""NAKER"" not a word, ""NIXER"" has I, ""NOYER"" not, ""NUBER"" not, ""NUDER"" not, ""NUMER"" not, ""NURSE"" has S -> invalid, ""NUTTY"" not, etc.) So only ""NUKER"" seems common.

 With N at 2:
   _ N _ E R -> we have ""UNDER"", and also ""ANGER"" but A excluded, ""INKER"" I excluded, ""ONCER"" C excluded, ""OWNER"" has N at 3? No, ""OWNER"" is O W N E R -> N at 3, not 2. 
   ""HONEY"" not ending with ER.

   ""JNANA"" not.

   So only ""UNDER"" is common.

   Also, ""UNLED"" not ending with ER.

   ""UNMET"" has T.

   So ""UNDER"" is the main candidate for N at 2.

   Another: ""UNWED"" not.

   ""UNZIP"" not.

   So we have two candidates: ""NUKER"" and ""UNDER"".

 We can choose one to guess. Since we have two possibilities, we can pick one arbitrarily, but we have to make a guess.

 Alternatively, we can think of a word that tests both possibilities? But we have to fill the entire word.

 We can guess ""NUKER"" and if it's not, then ""UNDER"" must be the word.

 But we have to use one guess.

 Let's see the frequency: ""UNDER"" is more common than ""NUKER"". So perhaps ""UNDER"" is more likely.

 But we don't know.

 We can also consider that in ""miner"", we had N at 3 and it was present but wrong. If the word were ""NUKER"", then N is at 1, which is a new position. Similarly, for ""UNDER"", N is at 2.

 We have no information about position 1 or 2 for N.

 So we can choose ""UNDER"" because it's a more common word.

 But note: we have to avoid excluded letters. Both are safe.

 I'll go with ""UNDER"".

 But wait: in ""UNDER"", we have U at 1 and D at 3. We haven't tested U or D.

 Similarly, in ""NUKER"", we have U at 2 and K at 3.

 We are testing new letters in both.

 But ""UNDER"" is a very common word.

 So the fourth guess: ""UNDER""

 If it's not, then we try ""NUKER"" next.

 But we have two guesses left? We are at guess 4, and we have 6 tries.

 So we can do that.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that tests the presence of U? But we are forced to use one of these patterns.

 I think ""UNDER"" is a good guess.

 So let's go with ""UNDER"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: R, N, E are present (but misplaced); C and A are absent.
- **Guess 2 (stern)**: E, R, N are present (but misplaced); S and T are absent.
- **Guess 3 (miner)**: 
  - E (position 4) and R (position 5) are correct (✓).
  - N is present but misplaced (-), so it cannot be in position 3.
  - M and I are absent (x).

### Key Deductions:
1. **Fixed positions**: 
   - Position 4 must be **E**.
   - Position 5 must be **R**.
   - The word ends with **ER**.
2. **N constraints**: 
   - N is in the word but cannot be in positions 3, 4 (from Guess 1), or 5 (from Guess 2). Thus, N must be in position **1 or 2**.
3. **Absent letters**: C, A, S, T, M, I (cannot appear in the word).
4. **Word structure**: `_ _ _ E R` (with N in position 1 or 2).

### Analysis for Next Guess:
- The secret word must be 5 letters, ending with ""ER"", with N at position 1 or 2, and no excluded letters.
- Possible candidates:
  - **N at position 1**: Words like **NUKER** (N _ _ E R). However, ""NUKER"" is uncommon.
  - **N at position 2**: Words like **UNDER** (_ N _ E R), which is a common word and fits all constraints.
- **UNDER** is chosen because:
  - It places N in position 2 (valid, as N cannot be in 3/4/5).
  - It uses new letters (U, D) to test their presence.
  - It adheres to all feedback and excluded letters.

But typically in Wordle, words can have repeated letters, but it\'s less common. Since the feedback didn\'t indicate any duplicate, we assume no duplicates for now.\n\n We have three known letters: R, N, E. We need two more letters.\n\n We can try to use a word that has R, N, E and two new common consonants or vowels.\n\n Common consonants: T, S, L, etc.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word.\n\n Possibilities:\n\n We know R cannot be at position 2. So R can be at 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n Similarly, N cannot be at 4, so N can be at 1,2,3,5.\n E cannot be at 5, so E can be at 1,2,3,4.\n\n We also want to test new letters. Let\'s try to include \'T\' and \'S\' for example.\n\n Example words:\n\n - ""RENTS"": \n   R at position 1 (which is new for R, since previously R was at 2 -> now 1 is different)\n   E at position 2 (previously E was at 5 -> now 2 is different)\n   N at position 3 (previously N was at 4 -> now 3 is different)\n   T and S are new.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if T and S are in the word. This is a way to test.\n\n Alternatively, ""ROTED"" is not a word. We need valid words.\n\n Another idea: ""INERT"" -> but we cannot use A and C, but I is allowed? However, we don\'t know about I. But note: we have to avoid A and C, but other vowels are possible.\n\n However, we have to be cautious: the word must be valid.\n\n Let me think of words that have R, N, E and two other letters.\n\n Some options:\n\n - ""RENEW"" -> but E is repeated? We don\'t know if repetition is allowed. Also, E is at position 2 and 4? But we know E is in the word, but we don\'t know if it appears twice. However, the feedback for the first guess only showed one E as present, but if there were two, it would have shown two minuses? Actually, the feedback only marks each letter that is present. If a letter is repeated and one is in the correct position, it would show a check for that one and a minus for the other? But in our case, we only had one E and it was marked as minus. So the word might have one E or more? We don\'t know.\n\n But to keep it simple, let\'s avoid duplicates for now.\n\n Another word: ""ROBIN"" -> but we don\'t have E? We must include E because we know it\'s in the word. So we need R, N, and E.\n\n How about ""DRIVE""? But we don\'t have N? We must include N because we know it\'s in the word.\n\n We must include R, N, and E.\n\n Let me try: ""RINSE"" -> \n   R at 1 (new position, previously 2 -> so allowed)\n   I at 2 (new letter)\n   N at 3 (previously at 4, now 3 -> allowed)\n   S at 4 (new letter)\n   E at 5 -> but wait, in the first guess E was at 5 and we got a minus meaning E is in the word but not at 5. So we cannot put E at 5 again? Actually, we can, but if we put E at 5 and the secret word has E at 5, then we would get a check. But the feedback said E is not at 5, so if we put E at 5 again, we know it will be wrong? Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at 5 again, it will still be wrong. So we should avoid putting E at 5.\n\n Therefore, in ""RINSE"", E is at 5 -> which is the same position as before. We know that position is wrong, so we should avoid that.\n\n We need a word that has E not at 5.\n\n How about ""RENEW""? But that has two E\'s. And the second E is at 5? So we have E at 2 and 5. We know E is not at 5, so the E at 5 would be wrong, but the E at 2 might be correct? But we don\'t know. Also, we are using two E\'s.\n\n Alternatively, ""URINE"" -> \n   U at 1 (new)\n   R at 2 -> but wait, in the first guess R was at 2 and we got a minus meaning R is not at 2. So we cannot put R at 2 again? Actually, we can, but we know it\'s not at 2 so it will be minus again. We want to try R in a new position.\n\n So we should avoid putting R at 2, N at 4, and E at 5.\n\n Let me try to find a word that has:\n   R at 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2)\n   N at 1,2,3,5 (but not 4)\n   E at 1,2,3,4 (but not 5)\n\n And the word must be 5 letters and not contain C or A.\n\n Example: ""RODEO"" -> no N and E? Not good.\n\n Another: ""HORDE"" -> \n   H at 1\n   O at 2\n   R at 3 -> allowed (since R was at 2, now 3 is new)\n   D at 4\n   E at 5 -> not allowed (because E cannot be at 5)\n\n So we avoid E at 5.\n\n How about ""HORNE""? Not a word.\n\n ""RENAL"" -> but A is not allowed? We know A is not in the word, so we cannot use A.\n\n ""RENAL"" has A -> invalid.\n\n ""REIGN"" -> \n   R at 1 -> allowed (not position 2)\n   E at 2 -> allowed (not position 5)\n   I at 3\n   G at 4\n   N at 5 -> allowed (not position 4)\n\n This seems good: \n   Positions: R(1), E(2), I(3), G(4), N(5)\n\n We are testing R at 1, E at 2, and N at 5. Also, we are introducing I and G.\n\n So let\'s go with ""REIGN"".\n\n But note: we are not using the fact that in the first word, we had R at 2 and now we are putting R at 1. Similarly, E was at 5 and now at 2, and N was at 4 and now at 5.\n\n This is a valid guess.\n\n Alternatively, we could try ""ROUTE"" -> but E at 5 is not allowed.\n\n Another option: ""SERIF"" -> \n   S at 1\n   E at 2 -> allowed\n   R at 3 -> allowed (not 2)\n   I at 4\n   F at 5\n\n But we are missing N? We must include N because we know it\'s in the word. So we cannot leave out N.\n\n Therefore, we must have R, N, and E in the guess.\n\n So ""REIGN"" is a valid word that includes R, N, E and avoids the forbidden positions.\n\n Let me check if ""REIGN"" is a valid English word: yes, it means to rule.\n\n So I will guess ""REIGN"".\n\n However, note that we are also trying to test new letters. We are testing I and G, which we haven\'t tried before.\n\n We might also consider ""NERDY"" -> \n   N at 1 -> allowed (not 4)\n   E at 2 -> allowed (not 5)\n   R at 3 -> allowed (not 2)\n   D at 4\n   Y at 5\n\n But we don\'t know about D and Y. And ""NERDY"" is a word.\n\n But we have to choose one. Let me compare:\n\n ""REIGN"" and ""NERDY""\n\n Both are valid. But ""REIGN"" uses G and I, while ""NERDY"" uses D and Y.\n\n We might want to use more common letters. G is more common than Y? And D is common.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""ENTER"" -> \n   E at 1 -> allowed (not 5)\n   N at 2 -> allowed (not 4)\n   T at 3\n   E at 4 -> but wait, we are repeating E? We don\'t know if the word has two E\'s. Also, we are putting E at 1 and 4. The feedback for the first guess only showed one E, but that doesn\'t mean there isn\'t two. However, we are using two E\'s and we only know one is present. This might be inefficient.\n\n So I think ""REIGN"" is a good choice.\n\n Let me see if there\'s a word that uses more common letters. For example, including T or S.\n\n How about ""RENTS"": \n   R at 1 -> allowed\n   E at 2 -> allowed\n   N at 3 -> allowed (previously at 4, now 3 is new)\n   T at 4 -> but wait, N was at 4 in the first guess and we got a minus meaning N is not at 4. But now we are putting T at 4? That\'s fine. And S at 5.\n\n But E is at 2 and we are not repeating. Also, we are including T and S, which are common.\n\n However, we have to avoid putting E at 5? We are not. But note: we are putting N at 3 and E at 2, which are new positions.\n\n But what about the letter S? We don\'t know if it\'s in the word.\n\n Also, in ""RENTS"", we have R, E, N, T, S. That\'s five distinct letters? Yes.\n\n And the positions: \n   R:1 (new), E:2 (new), N:3 (new), T:4, S:5.\n\n We are testing T and S, which are common.\n\n But note: we are not using the fact that we know E is in the word? We are using E, so that\'s good.\n\n However, we are putting E at 2. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing.\n\n Also, we are putting N at 3, which is a new position.\n\n But wait: in the first guess, we had R at 2 and now we are putting R at 1. That\'s good.\n\n So ""RENTS"" is also a good candidate.\n\n Which one to choose? \n\n We want to maximize information. ""RENTS"" uses T and S, which are very common. ""REIGN"" uses I and G, which are less common.\n\n So ""RENTS"" might be better.\n\n But note: we are putting E at 2 and we don\'t know if that\'s correct. Also, we are putting N at 3 and T at 4 and S at 5.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""STERN"": \n   S at 1\n   T at 2\n   E at 3 -> allowed (not 5)\n   R at 4 -> allowed (not 2)\n   N at 5 -> allowed (not 4)\n\n This also includes R, N, E and uses S and T.\n\n And the positions are all new for R, N, E.\n\n So ""STERN"" is another option.\n\n Let me compare:\n\n ""RENTS"": R1, E2, N3, T4, S5\n ""STERN"": S1, T2, E3, R4, N5\n\n Both are valid.\n\n But note: in ""STERN"", we are putting R at 4 and N at 5. We haven\'t tried these positions.\n\n Also, we are testing S and T in both.\n\n I think ""STERN"" might be slightly better because it places R and N in positions we haven\'t tested at all (4 and 5) and E in 3.\n\n But we are also testing S at 1 and T at 2.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose ""ROUSE"" -> but E at 5 is not allowed.\n\n After consideration, I think ""STERN"" is a good choice.\n\n However, we must avoid using A and C, and both ""RENTS"" and ""STERN"" are safe.\n\n I\'ll go with ""STERN"" because it uses common letters and tests new positions.\n\n But note: we have to make sure we don\'t use any forbidden letters. We know the secret word does not contain C or A. ""STERN"" has S, T, E, R, N -> no C or A. Good.\n\n So let\'s choose ""STERN"".\n\n Alternatively, we can choose ""RENEW"" but that has two E\'s and we don\'t know if that\'s necessary. Also, E at 5 is not allowed? Actually, ""RENEW"" has E at 2 and 5. We know E is not at 5, so the E at 5 would be a waste? But if the word has two E\'s, then we might get a minus for the E at 5. But we don\'t know. So it\'s better to avoid duplicates for now.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""STERN"".\n\n But wait, in the first guess, we had R at 2 and we got a minus. Now in ""STERN"", we are putting R at 4. Similarly, E was at 5 and now at 3, and N was at 4 and now at 5. So we are testing new positions.\n\n So the second guess: ""STERN""\n\n Let me write it: S T E R N\n\n But note: the word is ""stern"".\n\n We\'ll see the feedback.\n\n However, note: the feedback for the first guess had R, N, and E as present. So we are including them.\n\n So I\'ll go with ""STERN"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C and A are absent (x), so they can be excluded from future guesses.\n- R, N, and E are present (-) but in incorrect positions. Specifically:\n  - R cannot be in position 2.\n  - N cannot be in position 4.\n  - E cannot be in position 5.\n\nFor the second guess, I need a 5-letter word that:\n1. Includes R, N, and E (since they are confirmed present).\n2. Avoids C and A (confirmed absent).\n3. Places R, N, and E in new positions (not 2, 4, and 5 respectively).\n4. Tests new common letters (like S and T) for maximum information.\n\nThe word ""stern"" fits all criteria:\n- Contains R (position 4), N (position 5), and E (position 3) — all in new positions.\n- Uses S and T (common letters not yet tested).\n- Avoids C and A.\n- Is a valid English word.\n\nThis guess will help narrow down the positions of R, N, E and test S and T efficiently.\n\n<guess>stern</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: stern -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) E(-) R(-) N(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n  C: x (not in the word)\n  R: - (in word, wrong position)\n  A: x (not in word)\n  N: - (in word, wrong position)\n  E: - (in word, wrong position)\n\nFrom this, we know:\n- The secret word contains R, N, E (each at least once).\n- It does not contain C or A.\n- R is not at position 2.\n- N is not at position 4.\n- E is not at position 5.\n\nGuess 2: ""stern""\n  S: x (not in word)\n  T: x (not in word)\n  E: - (in word, wrong position)\n  R: - (in word, wrong position)\n  N: - (in word, wrong position)\n\nFrom this, we know:\n- The secret word does not contain S or T.\n- E is in the word but not at position 3 (since ""stern"" has E at position 3 and it got a minus).\n- R is in the word but not at position 4 (since ""stern"" has R at position 4 and it got a minus).\n- N is in the word but not at position 5 (since ""stern"" has N at position 5 and it got a minus).\n\nWe also know that E is not at position 5 (from guess1) and not at position 3 (from guess2). Similarly, R is not at position 2 (guess1) and not at position 4 (guess2). N is not at position 4 (guess1) and not at position 5 (guess2).\n\nSo summary:\n\nLetters in the word: R, N, E (definitely at least once each)\nLetters not in the word: C, A, S, T\n\nWe need to include R, N, E and two new letters.\n\nPosition constraints:\n\nFor R:\nCannot be at: 2 (from ""crane"") and 4 (from ""stern"")\nSo possible positions: 1, 3, 5\n\nFor N:\nCannot be at: 4 (from ""crane"") and 5 (from ""stern"")\nSo possible positions: 1, 2, 3\n\nFor E:\nCannot be at: 5 (from ""crane"") and 3 (from ""stern"")\nSo possible positions: 1, 2, 4\n\nWe have used up two guesses and have four left.\n\nWe need to choose a word that:\n- Contains R, N, E\n- Does not contain C, A, S, T\n- Places R, N, E in positions that are still possible according to the constraints.\n\nAlso, we must introduce two new letters to test.\n\nWe have already tested: C, R, A, N, E, S, T (7 letters). So the remaining letters are many, but we need common ones.\n\nWe can use letters like: L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.\n\nWe need a 5-letter word with R, N, E and two others.\n\nWe need to form a valid word.\n\nWe also have to consider the positions: R must be at 1,3,5; N at 1,2,3; E at 1,2,4.\n\nWe can try to fix the positions and look for words.\n\nFor example, let R be at position 3 (one of the options). Then what?\n\nPossible word structures.\n\nLet me think of words containing R, N, E.\n\nSince E has only three possible positions (1,2,4), and R has three (1,3,5), and N has three (1,2,3), we need overlap.\n\nWe cannot have repeated letters? We don\'t know, but in the feedback so far, there has been no indication of duplicates. So we assume no duplicates for now.\n\nSo let E be at position 4. Then we have positions 1,2,3,5 to place R and N (and two other letters).\n\nBut E at 4: then positions:\n1: ?\n2: ?\n3: ?\n5: ?\n\nN must be at 1,2,3 (since it cannot be at 4 or 5). Similarly, R must be at 1,3,5.\n\nIf E is at 4, then position 4 is taken by E.\n\nThen for N: can be at 1,2,3.\n\nFor R: can be at 1,3,5.\n\nBut if R is at 3, and E at 4, then the word might be ? ? R E ?\n\nBut N must be in one of 1,2,3.\n\nFor example, if N at 1: then word: N ? R E ?\n\nIf N at 2: word: ? N R E ?\n\nIf N at 3: but R might also be at 3? But we assume distinct, so they can\'t both be at 3. So if E is at 4, position 3 must be either R or N? But we have to assign.\n\nActually, position 3 can be R or one of the new letters, and similarly.\n\nBut let\'s look for actual words.\n\nTry E at position 4.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ENDER: but has E at 2? And E at 5? We have E at 4, but also E at 2 and 5? That\'s multiple E\'s? But let\'s see structure.\n\nWe need E only once? We don\'t know.\n\nBut try: words like ""RENEW"" has E at 2 and 5 -> not good because E cannot be at 5.\n\nOther words: How about ""LINER""? But we don\'t know if L and I are in the word.\n\n""LINER"": \nPosition 1: L\nPosition 2: I\nPosition 3: N\nPosition 4: E\nPosition 5: R\n\nCheck constraints:\nR: at 5 -> allowed (since R can be at 1,3,5)\nN: at 3 -> allowed (N can be at 1,2,3)\nE: at 4 -> allowed (E can be at 1,2,4)\n\nAlso, L and I are new letters (not tested yet).\n\nAlso, no C,A,S,T -> good.\n\nIs ""LINER"" a word? Yes, meaning an ocean liner or a person who lines.\n\nSo this is a valid guess.\n\nBut note: we have N at position 3 and E at 4. In ""crane"", N was at 4 (which is not allowed, but now N at 3) and E was at 5 (not allowed, but now E at 4).\n\nAlso, R was at 2 in ""crane"" (not allowed) and now R at 5.\n\nSo this word satisfies all position constraints.\n\nWe can have other options.\n\nFor example, with E at position 4, R at 5, and N at 1: then word structure: N ? ? E R\n\nWhat words fit? e.g., ""NUDER""? Not a word. ""NEWER"" has two E\'s? E at 4, but E at 2? And E at 4? And E cannot be at 5? But ""NEWER"" has E at 2 and 5? Not good.\n\nWith E at position 4, R at 5, and N at 2: word: ? N ? E R -> e.g., ""INNER"" has two N\'s? Not good. Or ""MINER"": M at 1, I at 2? Then N at 3? But we need N at 2? ""MINER"" is M I N E R -> positions: N at 3, E at 4, R at 5. So N at 3 (allowed), E at 4 (allowed), R at 5 (allowed). Then the second letter is I? So word: M I N E R.\n\n""M"" and ""I"" are new letters.\n\n""MINER"" is a word.\n\nSimilarly, we could have ""LINER"" as above.\n\nAnother option: E at position 4, R at 3, and N somewhere? But R at 3: so positions 1,2 have letters? Then E at 4, then 5.\n\nN can be at 1 or 2.\n\nIf N at 1: word: N ? R E ? -> e.g., ""NARES"" but has A -> invalid. ""NORES"" but O? And we don\'t have A, but O? Also, ""NORES"" is not common? Actually, ""N"" something ""R"" ""E"" S -> but S is invalid? We know S is not in the word.\n\nWe cannot use S.\n\nSo perhaps not.\n\nWith E at other positions.\n\nFor example, E at position 1: allowed? E can be at 1,2,4.\n\nThen if E at 1, then word must be E ? ? ? ?\n\nThen R must be at 3 or 5? Or at 1? But 1 is E, so R cannot be at 1. So R at 3 or 5.\n\nN must be at 1? But 1 is E, so cannot have N at 1? So N must be at 2 or 3.\n\nBut position 1 is E.\n\nSo E at 1.\n\nPossible: word E _ _ _ _\n\nFor N: can be position 2 or 3.\n\nFor R: can be position 3 or 5.\n\nIf N at 2: and R at 3: then E at 1, N at 2, R at 3 -> then positions 4 and 5 are new letters.\n\nWord: E N R ? ? \n\nWhat words? ""ENROL"" but has O and L? But O is allowed? But the word has E at 1, N at 2, R at 3, O at 4, L at 5.\n\nBut N at 2: allowed? Yes.\n\nR at 3: allowed? Yes (R cannot be at 2 or 4, but 3 is okay).\n\nBut we have O and L.\n\nIs this a word? ""ENROL"" -> yes.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if O and L are in the word.\n\nSimilarly, we could have other words.\n\nBut let\'s compare with ""MINER"" or ""LINER"".\n\nAnother structure: E at position 2.\n\nThen word: ? E ? ? ?\n\nE at position 2: allowed.\n\nThen R possible positions: 1,3,5 (since cannot be 2 or 4? Wait, R cannot be at 2, but E is at 2? So no problem. R can be at 1,3,5)\n\nN possible positions: 1,2,3? But 2 is E, so N can only be at 1 or 3.\n\nSo if E at 2:\n\nThen N at 1 or 3.\n\nR at 1,3,5? But if N at 1, then R can be at 3 or 5? Not at 1.\n\nIf N at 1: then R at 3 or 5.\n\nThen word: N E ? ? R  or N E ? R ?  (if R at 3 or 5)\n\nFor example: N E R ? ? -> but R at 3? And E at 2.\n\nWord: ""NERDY"" but we know D and Y? But also, we know S and T are invalid? S and T are out, but D and Y we don\'t know.\n\n""Nerdy"" has positions: N1, E2, R3, D4, Y5.\n\nConstraints: N at 1: allowed (N positions:1,2,3)\nE at 2: allowed? Yes (since E must not be at 3 or 5? E cannot be at 3? From ""stern"", E at 3 got minus? And cannot be at 5 from ""crane"". But position 2 is new? Yes, so allowed.\n\nBut note: E was at 5 in ""crane"" and not at 3 in ""stern"", so position 2 is indeed available.\n\nSimilarly, R at 3: allowed? R cannot be at 2 or 4? 3 is allowed? Yes.\n\nSo ""NERDY"" is possible: letters N, E, R, D, Y -> no C,A,S,T -> valid.\n\nBut is Y a common letter? Not very, but possible.\n\nAlternatively, N E and then position 3 and 4,5.\n\nExamples: N E S S T -> but S and T are invalid.\n\nNot possible.\n\nAnother: N E W E R -> two E\'s? and E not at 5? But position 5 is R? Actually, ""newer"" has E at 2 and 5? But E cannot be at 5? So if we guess ""NEWER"", E at 5 would be wrong.\n\nBut we have E at position 5 again? We should avoid since we know E is not at 5.\n\nTherefore, ""NERDY"" or ""MINER"" or ""LINER"" or ""ENROL"".\n\nWe need to pick one.\n\nAlso, we must maximize information. So we want to test common unused letters.\n\nUnused letters so far: all except C,A,S,T,R,N,E (and the ones used in guesses, but only c,a,n,e,r,s,t).\n\nSo guess1: c,r,a,n,e -> letters tested: C,R,A,N,E\nguess2: s,t,e,r,n -> letters tested: S,T,E,R,N\n\nSo tested: A, C, E, N, R, S, T.\n\nSo unused: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe want common letters: e.g., L, I, O, D, U, M, P, etc.\n\nWe can calculate frequency, but roughly.\n\nFor now, I think ""LINER"" is a good choice because it uses L and I, which are common vowels and consonants.\n\nSimilarly, ""MINER"" uses M and I.\n\n""NERDY"" uses D and Y.\n\n""ENROL"" uses O and L.\n\n""LINER"" uses L and I.\n\nWe can choose ""LINER"" or ""MINER"".\n\nLet me pick ""MINER"" because M is a common consonant.\n\n""MINER"" structure:\nPosition 1: M\nPosition 2: I\nPosition 3: N\nPosition 4: E\nPosition 5: R\n\nConstraints:\nE at 4: allowed (E possible positions 1,2,4)\nN at 3: allowed (N possible positions 1,2,3)\nR at 5: allowed (R possible positions 1,3,5)\n\nAnd M and I are new.\n\nWe haven\'t tested M or I.\n\nThus, a good guess.\n\nWe could also do ""LINER"" with L at 1 and I at 2.\n\nBut both are valid.\n\nI think ""MINER"" is slightly better? Or not sure.\n\nAnother word: ""DINER"" -> \nPosition 1: D\nPosition 2: I\nPosition 3: N\nPosition 4: E\nPosition 5: R? \n\nBut E at 4: allowed? Yes.\nN at 3: allowed? Yes.\nR at 5: allowed? Yes.\n\nAnd D and I are new.\n\nAlso valid.\n\nBut ""miner"" is more common? \n\nSince we have to choose, I\'ll go with ""miner"".\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if M is in the word. We are testing it.\n\nIf M is absent, we get an \'x\' for M, which is useful.\n\nSimilarly, for I.\n\nSo I think ""MINER"" is a reasonable guess.\n\nAfter research, I found that ""miner"" is an appropriate word to use.\n\nSo the third guess: ""MINER""\n\nIn the response format, we output the guess.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **Guess 1 (crane)**: R, N, and E are present but in incorrect positions (R not in position 2, N not in position 4, E not in position 5). C and A are absent.\n- **Guess 2 (stern)**: E, R, and N are present but in incorrect positions (E not in position 3, R not in position 4, N not in position 5). S and T are absent.\n\nKey deductions:\n- The secret word contains R, N, and E (each at least once), and excludes C, A, S, T.\n- Position constraints:\n  - R can only be in positions 1, 3, or 5 (not 2 or 4).\n  - N can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (not 4 or 5).\n  - E can only be in positions 1, 2, or 4 (not 3 or 5).\n- The word must be 5 letters, using only untested letters besides R, N, E (e.g., avoiding C, A, S, T).\n\nFor this guess, ""MINER"" is selected because:\n- It includes R, N, E (required).\n- It avoids forbidden letters (C, A, S, T).\n- It places R, N, E in valid positions based on constraints:\n  - R at position 5 (allowed).\n  - N at position 3 (allowed).\n  - E at position 4 (allowed).\n- It introduces two new common letters (M and I) for testing.\n\n<guess>miner</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: stern -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) E(-) R(-) N(-)\nGuess 3: miner -> FEEDBACK: M(x) I(x) N(-) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from the third guess ""miner"":\n M: x (not in the word)\n I: x (not in the word)\n N: - (in the word but wrong position)\n E: ✓ (correct position)\n R: ✓ (correct position)\n\n So, from ""miner"":\n - E is in the word and in the correct position: position 4.\n - R is in the word and in the correct position: position 5.\n - N is in the word but not in position 3 (since we got a minus for N at position 3).\n - M and I are not in the word.\n\n Also, from previous guesses, we know:\n - The secret word contains R, N, E (which we already knew) and now we know E is at position 4 and R is at position 5.\n - We also know that N is not at position 3 (from this guess) and not at position 4 (from guess1) and not at position 5 (from guess2). But position 5 is R, so that\'s consistent. Also, from guess1, N was not at 4, and now we know E is at 4, so that\'s good.\n\n Now, the secret word has:\n   Position 4: E\n   Position 5: R\n\n And N is in the word but not at position 3, and not at 4 or 5 (which are taken). So N must be at position 1 or 2.\n\n Also, we know from guess1 that R was not at position 2 (which we already knew, and now R is at 5, so that\'s fine) and from guess2 that R was not at 4 (and now we have R at 5, so also fine).\n\n We also know that E is at 4, so it cannot be at 1 or 2 (but we already knew E was not at 5, and now we know it\'s at 4).\n\n Now, the word structure is: _ _ _ E R\n\n We know N is at either position 1 or 2.\n\n We also have two more letters to fill: the first and second positions (if N is at 1, then position 2 is another letter; if N is at 2, then position 1 is another letter). And position 3 is still unknown, but we know it\'s not N (because in ""miner"" we had N at 3 and it was wrong) and not E or R (since they are at 4 and 5).\n\n Also, we know the word does not contain: C, A, S, T, M, I.\n\n We need to find a word that fits: _ _ _ E R, with N in position 1 or 2, and the other two positions (the remaining one and position 3) are filled with letters that are not C, A, S, T, M, I.\n\n We also know that the word must contain N (which we are placing at 1 or 2) and the other two letters.\n\n Let\'s consider the possibilities:\n\n Case 1: N at position 1\n   Word: N _ _ E R\n   Then position 2 and 3 are two other letters.\n\n Case 2: N at position 2\n   Word: _ N _ E R\n   Then position 1 and 3 are two other letters.\n\n We need to find valid English words that fit one of these patterns and use only letters not excluded.\n\n Excluded letters: A, C, I, M, S, T.\n\n We can use: B, D, E (but E is already placed), F, G, H, J, K, L, N (but we are using it), O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n But note: we have to use two more distinct letters? We don\'t know if there are duplicates, but so far no duplicates have been indicated.\n\n We can try to list possible words.\n\n First, case 1: N at 1 -> N _ _ E R\n\n Possible words:\n   N U D E R -> ""NUDER"" (not a word)\n   N A G E R -> but A is excluded -> invalid\n   N O G E R -> ""NOGER"" (not a word)\n   N U K E R -> ""NUKER"" (a word, meaning one that nukes)\n   N I K E R -> but I is excluded -> invalid\n   N O K E R -> ""NOKER"" (not a word)\n   N O V E R -> ""NOVER"" (not a word)\n   N E V E R -> but E at position 2? And we have E at 4. But ""NEVER"" has two E\'s? And E at position 2: but we don\'t know if E is duplicated? However, in the first guess, we had E and it was marked as present (but not at 5) and now we have E at 4. If there is another E, it might be possible. But in ""NEVER"", we have E at 2 and 4. So if we guess ""NEVER"", then:\n        Position 1: N -> but we are considering N at 1, which is allowed? But we know N is not at 3, but we don\'t know about position 1. However, in this case, we are putting N at 1 and E at 2 and 4, and R at 5.\n\n        But we have to check the feedback: \n          In ""miner"", we had E at 4 correct, so if there is an E at 2, that would be a new E? But the feedback for ""miner"" didn\'t show an extra E? Actually, in ""miner"", we had only one E (at position 4) and it was correct. The feedback for E was a check, meaning that E is at 4. The other letters: M, I, N, R. The N was present but wrong position, and R was correct. There was no indication of a second E? But if the word had two E\'s, then in ""miner"" we only tested one E (at 4) and it was correct, so the other E (if at 2) would not have been tested. So it\'s possible.\n\n        However, we are not sure. But let\'s see if ""NEVER"" is a valid word? Yes.\n\n        But we have to check the constraints for N: in ""NEVER"", N is at 1 -> allowed (since N can be at 1 or 2). \n        Also, E at 2: but we know E can be at 1,2,4? And we have E at 4 already. But the feedback from guess1 and guess2 didn\'t rule out E at 2? \n          - In guess1, E was at 5 and got minus -> so E is not at 5, but 2 is different.\n          - In guess2, E was at 3 and got minus -> so E is not at 3, but 2 is different.\n          So E at 2 is allowed.\n\n        However, we have two E\'s? The secret word might have two E\'s? We don\'t know.\n\n        But note: in the first guess ""crane"", we had one E and it was marked as present (minus) meaning there is at least one E. Now we have E at 4 (correct) and if we put E at 2, that would be a second E? But we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s.\n\n        We can try ""NEVER"", but we are not forced to. We can avoid duplicates if possible.\n\n        But let\'s see other words.\n\n   Other words: ""NAKER"" -> not a word, and A is excluded.\n   ""NAB E R"" -> A excluded.\n\n   How about ""NUDER""? Not a word.\n\n   ""NUKER"": N at 1, U at 2, K at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> valid word? Yes, meaning one that nukes.\n\n   And U and K are not excluded.\n\n   So ""NUKER"" is a possibility.\n\n   Also, ""NONER"" -> not a word.\n\n   ""NOYER"" -> not a word.\n\n   ""NOHOW"" -> not ending with ER.\n\n   So ""NUKER"" is one.\n\n Case 2: N at position 2 -> _ N _ E R\n\n Possible words:\n   B N E E R -> ""BNEER"" not a word.\n   D N E E R -> ""DNEER"" not a word.\n   F N E E R -> not a word.\n   G N E E R -> ""GNEER"" not a word.\n   H N E E R -> not a word.\n   J N E E R -> not a word.\n   K N E E R -> not a word.\n   L N E E R -> not a word.\n   O N E E R -> ""ONEER"" not a word.\n   P N E E R -> not a word.\n   Q N E E R -> not a word.\n   U N E E R -> not a word.\n   V N E E R -> not a word.\n   W N E E R -> not a word.\n   X N E E R -> not a word.\n   Y N E E R -> not a word.\n   Z N E E R -> not a word.\n\n   What about ""ONCER""? But C is excluded.\n\n   How about ""UNDER""? \n        U at 1, N at 2, D at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> ""UNDER""\n        This is a valid word.\n\n        Constraints: \n          N at 2: allowed (N can be at 1,2,3 -> 2 is allowed)\n          E at 4: correct (we know)\n          R at 5: correct (we know)\n          U and D are new letters.\n\n        And no excluded letters.\n\n        So ""UNDER"" is a valid word.\n\n   Also, ""UNGER"": U at 1, N at 2, G at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> ""UNGER"" is a surname? But it\'s a valid word? Actually, it might be accepted as a proper noun, but in Wordle, common words are used. ""UNGER"" is not common. \n\n   ""UNPER""? Not a word.\n\n   ""UNMET""? But ends with T? T is excluded.\n\n   ""UNZIP""? But Z and P, but ends with P? We need ER at the end.\n\n   So ""UNDER"" is a common word.\n\n   Also, ""OWNER"": O at 1, W at 2, N at 3? But we need N at 2? ""OWNER"" has N at 3? So not.\n\n   ""INNER"": I is excluded and N at 2? ""INNER"" has I at 1, N at 2, N at 3? Duplicate N? And I is excluded.\n\n   ""HONER"": H at 1, O at 2, N at 3? But we need N at 2? So not.\n\n   So the main candidates are:\n        Case 1: ""NUKER"" (N at 1)\n        Case 2: ""UNDER"" (N at 2)\n\n We have two possibilities.\n\n We need to choose one.\n\n We can also consider if there are other words.\n\n Another word for case 1: ""NAZER""? Not a word.\n\n For case 2: ""UNGER"" might be accepted? But ""UNDER"" is better.\n\n Also, ""ONERY"" -> but not ending with ER.\n\n So between ""NUKER"" and ""UNDER"", which one to choose?\n\n We know that in the word, we have E at 4 and R at 5, and N at either 1 or 2.\n\n We also know that in the first guess, we had N at 4 (which is now E) and it was present but wrong position. In the second guess, N at 5 (which is now R) and it was present but wrong position. In the third guess, N at 3 and it was present but wrong position.\n\n So N has been tried at positions 3,4,5 and all were wrong. So it must be at 1 or 2.\n\n Now, we can choose a word that tests one of these.\n\n But note: we have only two possibilities? Actually, no, because the other letters matter.\n\n However, we can choose a word that will help us distinguish.\n\n But we have two candidates: ""NUKER"" and ""UNDER"". They are both possible.\n\n We can also think of other words? For example, ""FJORD"" but doesn\'t end with ER.\n\n We must end with ER.\n\n Another word: ""OUNCE"" but not ending with ER.\n\n So let\'s list all possible words:\n\n For pattern _ _ _ E R:\n\n With N at 1: \n   N _ _ E R -> we have ""NUKER"" (and maybe others? ""NAKER"" not a word, ""NIXER"" has I, ""NOYER"" not, ""NUBER"" not, ""NUDER"" not, ""NUMER"" not, ""NURSE"" has S -> invalid, ""NUTTY"" not, etc.) So only ""NUKER"" seems common.\n\n With N at 2:\n   _ N _ E R -> we have ""UNDER"", and also ""ANGER"" but A excluded, ""INKER"" I excluded, ""ONCER"" C excluded, ""OWNER"" has N at 3? No, ""OWNER"" is O W N E R -> N at 3, not 2. \n   ""HONEY"" not ending with ER.\n\n   ""JNANA"" not.\n\n   So only ""UNDER"" is common.\n\n   Also, ""UNLED"" not ending with ER.\n\n   ""UNMET"" has T.\n\n   So ""UNDER"" is the main candidate for N at 2.\n\n   Another: ""UNWED"" not.\n\n   ""UNZIP"" not.\n\n   So we have two candidates: ""NUKER"" and ""UNDER"".\n\n We can choose one to guess. Since we have two possibilities, we can pick one arbitrarily, but we have to make a guess.\n\n Alternatively, we can think of a word that tests both possibilities? But we have to fill the entire word.\n\n We can guess ""NUKER"" and if it\'s not, then ""UNDER"" must be the word.\n\n But we have to use one guess.\n\n Let\'s see the frequency: ""UNDER"" is more common than ""NUKER"". So perhaps ""UNDER"" is more likely.\n\n But we don\'t know.\n\n We can also consider that in ""miner"", we had N at 3 and it was present but wrong. If the word were ""NUKER"", then N is at 1, which is a new position. Similarly, for ""UNDER"", N is at 2.\n\n We have no information about position 1 or 2 for N.\n\n So we can choose ""UNDER"" because it\'s a more common word.\n\n But note: we have to avoid excluded letters. Both are safe.\n\n I\'ll go with ""UNDER"".\n\n But wait: in ""UNDER"", we have U at 1 and D at 3. We haven\'t tested U or D.\n\n Similarly, in ""NUKER"", we have U at 2 and K at 3.\n\n We are testing new letters in both.\n\n But ""UNDER"" is a very common word.\n\n So the fourth guess: ""UNDER""\n\n If it\'s not, then we try ""NUKER"" next.\n\n But we have two guesses left? We are at guess 4, and we have 6 tries.\n\n So we can do that.\n\n Alternatively, we could try a word that tests the presence of U? But we are forced to use one of these patterns.\n\n I think ""UNDER"" is a good guess.\n\n So let\'s go with ""UNDER"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (crane)**: R, N, E are present (but misplaced); C and A are absent.\n- **Guess 2 (stern)**: E, R, N are present (but misplaced); S and T are absent.\n- **Guess 3 (miner)**: \n  - E (position 4) and R (position 5) are correct (✓).\n  - N is present but misplaced (-), so it cannot be in position 3.\n  - M and I are absent (x).\n\n### Key Deductions:\n1. **Fixed positions**: \n   - Position 4 must be **E**.\n   - Position 5 must be **R**.\n   - The word ends with **ER**.\n2. **N constraints**: \n   - N is in the word but cannot be in positions 3, 4 (from Guess 1), or 5 (from Guess 2). Thus, N must be in position **1 or 2**.\n3. **Absent letters**: C, A, S, T, M, I (cannot appear in the word).\n4. **Word structure**: `_ _ _ E R` (with N in position 1 or 2).\n\n### Analysis for Next Guess:\n- The secret word must be 5 letters, ending with ""ER"", with N at position 1 or 2, and no excluded letters.\n- Possible candidates:\n  - **N at position 1**: Words like **NUKER** (N _ _ E R). However, ""NUKER"" is uncommon.\n  - **N at position 2**: Words like **UNDER** (_ N _ E R), which is a common word and fits all constraints.\n- **UNDER** is chosen because:\n  - It places N in position 2 (valid, as N cannot be in 3/4/5).\n  - It uses new letters (U, D) to test their presence.\n  - It adheres to all feedback and excluded letters.\n\n<guess>under</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: stern -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) E(-) R(-) N(-)\nGuess 3: miner -> FEEDBACK: M(x) I(x) N(-) E(✓) R(✓)\nGuess 4: under -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) D(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for Guess 4: ""under"" -> U(x) N(-) D(x) E(✓) R(✓)

From this:
- U is absent (x) → The secret word contains no U.
- N is present but not in position 2 (-) → So N is in the word, but not at position 2.
- D is absent (x) → The secret word contains no D.
- E and R are in the correct positions (✓) → Position 4 is E and position 5 is R.

Previous feedback helps us consolidate information:

From Guess 3 (""miner""):
- E is at position 4 (✓)
- R is at position 5 (✓)
- N is present but not at position 3 (-)
- M and I are absent (x)

From Guess 1 (""crane""):
- N is present but not at position 4 (-) → We already know E is at position 4, so consistent.
- E is present but not at position 5 (-) → We have E at 4 and R at 5, so position 5 is R, not E.

From Guess 2 (""stern""):
- N is present but not at position 5 (-) → Consistent since position 5 is R.

So, summarizing:
1. Positions 4 and 5 are fixed: E and R.
2. N must be in the word, but cannot be at:
   - Position 3 (from ""miner"")
   - Position 4 (from ""crane"" → fixed as E)
   - Position 5 (from ""stern"" → fixed as R)
   - Position 2 (from ""under"")
   So N must be at position 1 (the only position left).

We also know the absent letters: A, C, I, M, S, T, U, D.

Thus, the secret word has structure:
N _ _ E R

Now, we know the word starts with N, ends with ER, and we need the second and third letters.

We must be careful:
- The word is N ? ? E R
- The third character (position 3) cannot be N (since N is at position 1, and duplicates? We have no evidence of duplicates, but we should consider if necessary. However, the feedback has never indicated duplicates, so we assume distinct letters except when forced).

But note: we have not had any duplicate marks. Especially in the feedback for ""under"", we have only one N mark (as misplaced at position 2) and no indication of multiple N's. Similarly in previous guesses. So likely, only one N.

Therefore: positions 2 and 3 are two distinct letters that are not N, and are not any of the absent letters: A, C, D, I, M, S, T, U.

But note: E and R are already placed? So they are taken? So we need letters that are not E, R, N? Because each letter appears once? We are not forced, but without duplication signs, we assume distinct.

Therefore, we need two distinct, unused letters for positions 2 and 3.

Excluded letters so far: A, C, D, I, M, S, T, U.

Also, from guesses, we have tested: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, E, R, N (from first two guesses), M, I, N, E, R (guess 3), U, N, D, E, R (guess 4). So the letters we know are absent are: A, C, D, I, M, S, T, U.

We can use: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a word: N ? ? E R

Possible words?

Let's think of English words: N ? ? E R

- ""N**O**W E R"" -> ""NOWER"" not common; not valid?
- ""N**E**E R"" → E at position 2? But we have E at 4? And ""NEER"" is not a standalone word? It's poetic for ""never"". Not typically accepted.
- ""N**I**C E R"" → I and C excluded? C is absent, I absent → invalid.
- ""N**A**Z E R"" → A is absent → invalid.
- ""N**O**B E R"" → ""NOBER"" not a word.
- ""N**O**K E R"" → not common.
- ""N**O**V E R"" → ""NOVER"" not a word.
- ""N**U**G E R"" → U is absent → invalid.
- ""N**O**G E R"" → Not a word.
- ""N**O**Y E R"" → ""NOYER"" not common.
- ""N**L**? Weird.

Common words:

- ""N A G E R"" → A excluded.
- ""N I C E R"" → excluded.
- What about ""N E W E R"" → ""NEWER"" → has two E's? And E at 2 and 4? 
  - If we try ""NEWER"": 
    - Positions: N1, E2, W3, E4, R5
    - We already know E at 4 is correct. Now E at 2: that would be a second E? 
    - Is a second E possible? We haven't explicitly ruled it out. The feedback for ""miner"" had only one E (at 4) marked correct. We didn't test position 2 with E? 
    - So it's possible? 
    - But then: the E at position 2 would be a new E? But in ""under"" we didn't test position 2 with E? It was N at position 2.

  However, in ""under"" guess, we had U at 1 (absent), N at 2 (present but wrong → so N is not at 2, but if E was at 2, then we haven't tested that? Actually, in ""under"" we did not test E at position 2? We had U at 1, N at 2, D at 3, E at 4, R at 5. The feedback for position 2 was N (which got a minus), meaning that N is present but not at 2. It doesn't say anything about E? But position 2 was occupied by N, not E.

  So the secret word having E at 2 is possible? Only if E is duplicated. Because E at 2 is not at 4? We know E at 4 is correct. 

  To avoid complexity, perhaps assume no duplicates? Since we haven't seen any.

  But let me see: previous guesses tested only one E? In ""crane"", E was at 5; in ""stern"", E at 3; in ""miner"", E at 4 (correct); in ""under"", E at 4 (correct). So position 2 has never been tested? And we don't know if E is duplicated? 

  However, given that only position 1 remains for N, we must consider words with N at 1 and any letters at 2 and 3.

  ""NEWER"" is a valid word? Yes.

  But we have ""E"" twice? We don't know? We can test.

  Another option: ""NUKER"" but U is excluded → we learned U is absent in guess 4.

  ""NUKER"" is invalid because U is absent.

  Similarly, ""NUDER"" has D and U? Both absent? Invalid.

  Now, ""NEWER"": N1, E2, W3, E4, R5.

  Constraints: 
  - N at 1: allowed? Yes (since N must be at 1 or 2? Now we know N must be at 1 because position 2 is ruled out by guess 4? Yes: from guess 4, N cannot be at 2, and positions 3,4,5 are out? So N must be at position 1. So that's fine.
  - E at 4: correct? We know that's fixed.
  - R at 5: fixed.
  - At position 2: E? Would that be a duplicate E? We don't know? 
  - But the word ""NEWER"" is common? Yes.

  However, we have E at position 2? That is, the secret word would have E at 2 and 4? But we only knew about one E? But it's possible.

  Also, included letter W? We haven't tested W.

  But let's check against feedback: 

  We know the secret word has E at 4 and R at 5. In guessing ""NEWER"", we would test:

    Position 1: N → if N is at 1, it will be correct? We suspect N is at 1? 
    Position 2: E → is E present? But we already have E at 4? So if there is another E, it would show as minus or check? 
    Actually, in ""NEWER"", we have E at 2 and E at 4. The E at 4 would show as check? The E at 2? We haven't placed E at 2 before? 

  But in the feedback rules: 
    ✓: letter in correct position
    -: letter in word but not this position
    x: letter not in word

  If we guess ""NEWER"" and the secret word has only one E (at position 4), then:
    Position 1: N? If N is at 1, check? 
    Position 2: E? But the secret word does not have E at 2? And if no duplicate, then this E is not present? So it would be x? 

  But we think the secret word has N at 1? Then position 1 N is ✓, position 4 E ✓, position 5 R ✓? Position 2 E? If the word has no other E, then E at 2 would be x? Position 3 W: if not in the word, x.

  But we are almost sure that N is at 1? 

  Alternatively, the word could be ""NONER""? But not a word? 

  Another possibility: ""NOYER""? Not a word? 

Common words: ""NEWER"" or ""NEVER""?

  ""NEVER"": N1, E2, V3, E4, R5.

  That seems a very common word.

  With V? We haven't tested V.

  Now, we can choose ""NEVER"".

  Why? Because it uses V? 

  But note: we have 6 tries? This is guess 5? We have to get it.

  We are certain about positions 1,4,5? Only position 1 is not 100% confirmed? We deduced N must be at 1? 

  How sure? 

  From all constraints: 
    N must be in the word. 
    Tried at positions: 2 (under: no), 3 (miner: no), 4 (crane: no), 5 (stern: no). Only position 1 left? 

  So positions 5 and 4 are taken? Position 3 cannot have N because miner feedback: N was at 3 and got a minus? Position 2 cannot have N because under feedback: N at 2 and got minus? 

  So absolute: N must be at position 1.

  Therefore, the word is N _ _ E R.

  So we don't need to hope for ""NEWER"" with duplicate E? That was just an example.

  Now, for the second and third positions: two distinct letters from the available set. 

  We need to list possible words.

  N _ _ E R

  Possibilities:

  - With second letter O: 
      ""N_O_ER"": ""NO?ER"" -> ""NOVER"", ""NOBER"", ""NOGER"" → all not words? 
      ""NONER"" → not common? 
      ""NOW ER"" → not words.

  - With second letter L:
      ""NL?ER"" → ""NLYER"" no? ""NILER"" has I → invalid.

  - With second letter K:
      ""N K ? E R"": ""NKE"" -> ""NACKER"" too long? 
      ""N K E E R"" → ""NKEER"" not a word? 
      But also ""NUKER"" invalid? 

  Common words: 

  - ""NEVER"": N E V E R → duplicate E? 
  - ""NICER"": but I and C excluded → no.
  - ""NAKER"": not a word? and A excluded.

  Another word: ""N O B L E R""? Too long.

  How about ""N O P E R"" → ""NOPER"" not a word? 

  Another idea: ""N I G E R"" → I excluded.

  What about ""NYMPH"" not ending ER.

  We must have ER ending.

  Valid words: 

  - ""NEWER"": N E W E R → but duplicate E? 
  - ""NEVER"": yes, common word? 
  - ""NONER"": rarely used? 
  - ""NOXER""? no.

  I found ""NOBBY"" not ER.

  Perhaps ""JEWER"" not? 

  Another: ""H E W E R"" not starting with N.

  We need 5 letters: starting with N, ending with ER.

  Common words: 
    - ""NAKER"" → no. 
    - ""NARKY"" no? 

  ""NEVER"" is acceptable? Or ""BONER"" not.

  So let me try ""NEVER"": 
    Positions: 1: N, 2: E, 3: V, 4: E, 5: R.

  Constraints for E: we know E can be at 1,2,4? From previous? From Guess 1: E not position 5? Guess 2: E not position 3? But now E at position 2? That's a new position? So allowed? 

  But we have E at position 2 and position 4? We previously had only one E confirmed? 

  We can guess ""NEVER"" and see? 

  But we have to form it.

  Alternatively, ""NIXER"" has I→ excluded.

  ""NUDER""→ D excluded.

  ""NOYER""→ not common.

  ""NOKER""→ not common.

  ""N WER""? Not.

  So ""NEVER"" seems the most common? 

  But let me confirm: ""NEWER"" is another option? Also common? 

  But ""NEWER"" has two E's? 

  So possible words: ""NEVER"", ""NEWER"", ""NO?ER"" (if any), but minimal choice.

  To be safe, let's choose ""NEVER"".

  Why? Because even if there are two E's, it was not ruled out? 

  Also, V is a new letter? We haven't tested V.

  In guess 4 we tested U (absent), D (absent), so we try V now.

  If V is in the word, we get feedback? 

  So guess ""NEVER"". 

  Alternatively, we could try a word like ""N W E R"" but with two letters? 

  Since the word is ""N _ _ E R"", and we are at guess 5? We have only two positions unknown? 

  Perhaps optimize by using more common letters? 

  For example, we can try a word with common unused letters? Like O, L, etc.

  But in ""NEVER"", we use E again at position 2? But that is also a test for duplicate E.

  But we have nothing else? 

  Given the time, I choose ""NEVER"".

  So the guess is ""NEVER""

  Feedback will reveal if E is duplicated? 

  If the word is ""NEVER"", we get: 
    Position1: N (if at 1, should be ✓)
    Position2: E? Could be ✓, - or x? 
        If the secret word has E only at 4, then E at 2 would be x? 
        But we suspect some words have E at 2? 
    Position3: V? 
    Positions4 and 5: E and R: ✓

  Or if the word is ""NEWER"", same thing.

  But let's not give up: another word? ""NOTER""? N O T E R? But T is excluded → from guess 2, T is absent? 

  So T cannot be used.

  Therefore, no ""NOTER"". 

  ""LOSER"" → doesn't start with N.

  The only common one left is ""NEVER"".

  So I'll guess ""NEVER"". 

  But note: we have 6 guesses? And this is guess 5? We have one more if wrong.

  But we might be able to do better.

  Wait: ""NEVER"" has E at position 2? That position was not tested before? 

  Perhaps try ""NOVER"" or ""NOBER"" → not words? 

  What about ""N I G H T"" → not ER.

  After research, ""NEVER"" is a valid option? 

  Another: ""NE PER"" → not.

  So reluctantly, ""NEVER"". 

  Or ""NEWER""? Both are valid.

  But ""NEWER"" uses W? 

  They are similar.

  But here is the problem: we don't know how many E's? 

  Since we are forced to, let me pick ""NEVER"" because it's more common.

  So guessed word: ""NEVER""

  But note: we haven't tested position 2? We have tried position 2 only with letters: in ""crane"" position 2 was R? Then ""miner"" had M (absent) at 2? ""under"" had N at 2 (which was misplaced)? 

  So position 2 has been tested with R (miner had not at 2? We didn't test specifically position 2? Not by letter but with those letters? 

  Actually, we know that whatever letter is at position 2, we haven't tested that possible letter being present or absent? 

  So guessing is inevitable? 

  Therefore, I'll proceed.

  But logically, what are the possible words? The only common word with structure N _ _ E R and no excluded letters is ""NEVER"" or ""NEWER""? 

  Yes.

  So this is the guess.

<guess>never</guess> 
</think>
Based on all previous feedback:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Fixed Positions**:
   - Positions 4 (E) and 5 (R) are confirmed correct (✓ from Guess 3 and 4).

2. **N must be at Position 1**:
   - N is present but rules out:
     - Position 2 (Guess 4: `under` → N(-)).
     - Position 3 (Guess 3: `miner` → N(-)).
     - Position 4 (Guess 1: `crane` → N(-)).
     - Position 5 (Guess 2: `stern` → N(-)).
   - Only position 1 remains ⇒ **N must be at position 1**.

3. **Word Structure**:
   - Secret word is **N _ _ E R**.
   - Position 3 is not N (no duplicates indicated).
   - Positions 2 and 3 require distinct letters not excluded.

4. **Absent Letters**:
   - C, A, S, T (from early guesses).
   - M, I (Guess 3).
   - U, D (Guess 4).
   - Letters available: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

5. **Possible Words**:
   - Common candidates fitting `N _ _ E R` include **NEWER** (N,E,W,E,R) or **NEVER** (N,E,V,E,R), despite duplicated E (not explicitly ruled out).
   - Given exclusão lists, **NEVER** is selected as the most common valid word. It tests:
     - N at position 1 (✓ expected).
     - E at position 2 (new test; potential duplicate).
     - V at position 3 (new letter).
     - E/R at 4/5 (✓ confirmed).

<guess>never</guess>",never,"We are given feedback for Guess 4: ""under"" -> U(x) N(-) D(x) E(✓) R(✓)

From this:
- U is absent (x) → The secret word contains no U.
- N is present but not in position 2 (-) → So N is in the word, but not at position 2.
- D is absent (x) → The secret word contains no D.
- E and R are in the correct positions (✓) → Position 4 is E and position 5 is R.

Previous feedback helps us consolidate information:

From Guess 3 (""miner""):
- E is at position 4 (✓)
- R is at position 5 (✓)
- N is present but not at position 3 (-)
- M and I are absent (x)

From Guess 1 (""crane""):
- N is present but not at position 4 (-) → We already know E is at position 4, so consistent.
- E is present but not at position 5 (-) → We have E at 4 and R at 5, so position 5 is R, not E.

From Guess 2 (""stern""):
- N is present but not at position 5 (-) → Consistent since position 5 is R.

So, summarizing:
1. Positions 4 and 5 are fixed: E and R.
2. N must be in the word, but cannot be at:
   - Position 3 (from ""miner"")
   - Position 4 (from ""crane"" → fixed as E)
   - Position 5 (from ""stern"" → fixed as R)
   - Position 2 (from ""under"")
   So N must be at position 1 (the only position left).

We also know the absent letters: A, C, I, M, S, T, U, D.

Thus, the secret word has structure:
N _ _ E R

Now, we know the word starts with N, ends with ER, and we need the second and third letters.

We must be careful:
- The word is N ? ? E R
- The third character (position 3) cannot be N (since N is at position 1, and duplicates? We have no evidence of duplicates, but we should consider if necessary. However, the feedback has never indicated duplicates, so we assume distinct letters except when forced).

But note: we have not had any duplicate marks. Especially in the feedback for ""under"", we have only one N mark (as misplaced at position 2) and no indication of multiple N's. Similarly in previous guesses. So likely, only one N.

Therefore: positions 2 and 3 are two distinct letters that are not N, and are not any of the absent letters: A, C, D, I, M, S, T, U.

But note: E and R are already placed? So they are taken? So we need letters that are not E, R, N? Because each letter appears once? We are not forced, but without duplication signs, we assume distinct.

Therefore, we need two distinct, unused letters for positions 2 and 3.

Excluded letters so far: A, C, D, I, M, S, T, U.

Also, from guesses, we have tested: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, E, R, N (from first two guesses), M, I, N, E, R (guess 3), U, N, D, E, R (guess 4). So the letters we know are absent are: A, C, D, I, M, S, T, U.

We can use: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a word: N ? ? E R

Possible words?

Let's think of English words: N ? ? E R

- ""N**O**W E R"" -> ""NOWER"" not common; not valid?
- ""N**E**E R"" → E at position 2? But we have E at 4? And ""NEER"" is not a standalone word? It's poetic for ""never"". Not typically accepted.
- ""N**I**C E R"" → I and C excluded? C is absent, I absent → invalid.
- ""N**A**Z E R"" → A is absent → invalid.
- ""N**O**B E R"" → ""NOBER"" not a word.
- ""N**O**K E R"" → not common.
- ""N**O**V E R"" → ""NOVER"" not a word.
- ""N**U**G E R"" → U is absent → invalid.
- ""N**O**G E R"" → Not a word.
- ""N**O**Y E R"" → ""NOYER"" not common.
- ""N**L**? Weird.

Common words:

- ""N A G E R"" → A excluded.
- ""N I C E R"" → excluded.
- What about ""N E W E R"" → ""NEWER"" → has two E's? And E at 2 and 4? 
  - If we try ""NEWER"": 
    - Positions: N1, E2, W3, E4, R5
    - We already know E at 4 is correct. Now E at 2: that would be a second E? 
    - Is a second E possible? We haven't explicitly ruled it out. The feedback for ""miner"" had only one E (at 4) marked correct. We didn't test position 2 with E? 
    - So it's possible? 
    - But then: the E at position 2 would be a new E? But in ""under"" we didn't test position 2 with E? It was N at position 2.

  However, in ""under"" guess, we had U at 1 (absent), N at 2 (present but wrong → so N is not at 2, but if E was at 2, then we haven't tested that? Actually, in ""under"" we did not test E at position 2? We had U at 1, N at 2, D at 3, E at 4, R at 5. The feedback for position 2 was N (which got a minus), meaning that N is present but not at 2. It doesn't say anything about E? But position 2 was occupied by N, not E.

  So the secret word having E at 2 is possible? Only if E is duplicated. Because E at 2 is not at 4? We know E at 4 is correct. 

  To avoid complexity, perhaps assume no duplicates? Since we haven't seen any.

  But let me see: previous guesses tested only one E? In ""crane"", E was at 5; in ""stern"", E at 3; in ""miner"", E at 4 (correct); in ""under"", E at 4 (correct). So position 2 has never been tested? And we don't know if E is duplicated? 

  However, given that only position 1 remains for N, we must consider words with N at 1 and any letters at 2 and 3.

  ""NEWER"" is a valid word? Yes.

  But we have ""E"" twice? We don't know? We can test.

  Another option: ""NUKER"" but U is excluded → we learned U is absent in guess 4.

  ""NUKER"" is invalid because U is absent.

  Similarly, ""NUDER"" has D and U? Both absent? Invalid.

  Now, ""NEWER"": N1, E2, W3, E4, R5.

  Constraints: 
  - N at 1: allowed? Yes (since N must be at 1 or 2? Now we know N must be at 1 because position 2 is ruled out by guess 4? Yes: from guess 4, N cannot be at 2, and positions 3,4,5 are out? So N must be at position 1. So that's fine.
  - E at 4: correct? We know that's fixed.
  - R at 5: fixed.
  - At position 2: E? Would that be a duplicate E? We don't know? 
  - But the word ""NEWER"" is common? Yes.

  However, we have E at position 2? That is, the secret word would have E at 2 and 4? But we only knew about one E? But it's possible.

  Also, included letter W? We haven't tested W.

  But let's check against feedback: 

  We know the secret word has E at 4 and R at 5. In guessing ""NEWER"", we would test:

    Position 1: N → if N is at 1, it will be correct? We suspect N is at 1? 
    Position 2: E → is E present? But we already have E at 4? So if there is another E, it would show as minus or check? 
    Actually, in ""NEWER"", we have E at 2 and E at 4. The E at 4 would show as check? The E at 2? We haven't placed E at 2 before? 

  But in the feedback rules: 
    ✓: letter in correct position
    -: letter in word but not this position
    x: letter not in word

  If we guess ""NEWER"" and the secret word has only one E (at position 4), then:
    Position 1: N? If N is at 1, check? 
    Position 2: E? But the secret word does not have E at 2? And if no duplicate, then this E is not present? So it would be x? 

  But we think the secret word has N at 1? Then position 1 N is ✓, position 4 E ✓, position 5 R ✓? Position 2 E? If the word has no other E, then E at 2 would be x? Position 3 W: if not in the word, x.

  But we are almost sure that N is at 1? 

  Alternatively, the word could be ""NONER""? But not a word? 

  Another possibility: ""NOYER""? Not a word? 

Common words: ""NEWER"" or ""NEVER""?

  ""NEVER"": N1, E2, V3, E4, R5.

  That seems a very common word.

  With V? We haven't tested V.

  Now, we can choose ""NEVER"".

  Why? Because it uses V? 

  But note: we have 6 tries? This is guess 5? We have to get it.

  We are certain about positions 1,4,5? Only position 1 is not 100% confirmed? We deduced N must be at 1? 

  How sure? 

  From all constraints: 
    N must be in the word. 
    Tried at positions: 2 (under: no), 3 (miner: no), 4 (crane: no), 5 (stern: no). Only position 1 left? 

  So positions 5 and 4 are taken? Position 3 cannot have N because miner feedback: N was at 3 and got a minus? Position 2 cannot have N because under feedback: N at 2 and got minus? 

  So absolute: N must be at position 1.

  Therefore, the word is N _ _ E R.

  So we don't need to hope for ""NEWER"" with duplicate E? That was just an example.

  Now, for the second and third positions: two distinct letters from the available set. 

  We need to list possible words.

  N _ _ E R

  Possibilities:

  - With second letter O: 
      ""N_O_ER"": ""NO?ER"" -> ""NOVER"", ""NOBER"", ""NOGER"" → all not words? 
      ""NONER"" → not common? 
      ""NOW ER"" → not words.

  - With second letter L:
      ""NL?ER"" → ""NLYER"" no? ""NILER"" has I → invalid.

  - With second letter K:
      ""N K ? E R"": ""NKE"" -> ""NACKER"" too long? 
      ""N K E E R"" → ""NKEER"" not a word? 
      But also ""NUKER"" invalid? 

  Common words: 

  - ""NEVER"": N E V E R → duplicate E? 
  - ""NICER"": but I and C excluded → no.
  - ""NAKER"": not a word? and A excluded.

  Another word: ""N O B L E R""? Too long.

  How about ""N O P E R"" → ""NOPER"" not a word? 

  Another idea: ""N I G E R"" → I excluded.

  What about ""NYMPH"" not ending ER.

  We must have ER ending.

  Valid words: 

  - ""NEWER"": N E W E R → but duplicate E? 
  - ""NEVER"": yes, common word? 
  - ""NONER"": rarely used? 
  - ""NOXER""? no.

  I found ""NOBBY"" not ER.

  Perhaps ""JEWER"" not? 

  Another: ""H E W E R"" not starting with N.

  We need 5 letters: starting with N, ending with ER.

  Common words: 
    - ""NAKER"" → no. 
    - ""NARKY"" no? 

  ""NEVER"" is acceptable? Or ""BONER"" not.

  So let me try ""NEVER"": 
    Positions: 1: N, 2: E, 3: V, 4: E, 5: R.

  Constraints for E: we know E can be at 1,2,4? From previous? From Guess 1: E not position 5? Guess 2: E not position 3? But now E at position 2? That's a new position? So allowed? 

  But we have E at position 2 and position 4? We previously had only one E confirmed? 

  We can guess ""NEVER"" and see? 

  But we have to form it.

  Alternatively, ""NIXER"" has I→ excluded.

  ""NUDER""→ D excluded.

  ""NOYER""→ not common.

  ""NOKER""→ not common.

  ""N WER""? Not.

  So ""NEVER"" seems the most common? 

  But let me confirm: ""NEWER"" is another option? Also common? 

  But ""NEWER"" has two E's? 

  So possible words: ""NEVER"", ""NEWER"", ""NO?ER"" (if any), but minimal choice.

  To be safe, let's choose ""NEVER"".

  Why? Because even if there are two E's, it was not ruled out? 

  Also, V is a new letter? We haven't tested V.

  In guess 4 we tested U (absent), D (absent), so we try V now.

  If V is in the word, we get feedback? 

  So guess ""NEVER"". 

  Alternatively, we could try a word like ""N W E R"" but with two letters? 

  Since the word is ""N _ _ E R"", and we are at guess 5? We have only two positions unknown? 

  Perhaps optimize by using more common letters? 

  For example, we can try a word with common unused letters? Like O, L, etc.

  But in ""NEVER"", we use E again at position 2? But that is also a test for duplicate E.

  But we have nothing else? 

  Given the time, I choose ""NEVER"".

  So the guess is ""NEVER""

  Feedback will reveal if E is duplicated? 

  If the word is ""NEVER"", we get: 
    Position1: N (if at 1, should be ✓)
    Position2: E? Could be ✓, - or x? 
        If the secret word has E only at 4, then E at 2 would be x? 
        But we suspect some words have E at 2? 
    Position3: V? 
    Positions4 and 5: E and R: ✓

  Or if the word is ""NEWER"", same thing.

  But let's not give up: another word? ""NOTER""? N O T E R? But T is excluded → from guess 2, T is absent? 

  So T cannot be used.

  Therefore, no ""NOTER"". 

  ""LOSER"" → doesn't start with N.

  The only common one left is ""NEVER"".

  So I'll guess ""NEVER"". 

  But note: we have 6 guesses? And this is guess 5? We have one more if wrong.

  But we might be able to do better.

  Wait: ""NEVER"" has E at position 2? That position was not tested before? 

  Perhaps try ""NOVER"" or ""NOBER"" → not words? 

  What about ""N I G H T"" → not ER.

  After research, ""NEVER"" is a valid option? 

  Another: ""NE PER"" → not.

  So reluctantly, ""NEVER"". 

  Or ""NEWER""? Both are valid.

  But ""NEWER"" uses W? 

  They are similar.

  But here is the problem: we don't know how many E's? 

  Since we are forced to, let me pick ""NEVER"" because it's more common.

  So guessed word: ""NEVER""

  But note: we haven't tested position 2? We have tried position 2 only with letters: in ""crane"" position 2 was R? Then ""miner"" had M (absent) at 2? ""under"" had N at 2 (which was misplaced)? 

  So position 2 has been tested with R (miner had not at 2? We didn't test specifically position 2? Not by letter but with those letters? 

  Actually, we know that whatever letter is at position 2, we haven't tested that possible letter being present or absent? 

  So guessing is inevitable? 

  Therefore, I'll proceed.

  But logically, what are the possible words? The only common word with structure N _ _ E R and no excluded letters is ""NEVER"" or ""NEWER""? 

  Yes.

  So this is the guess.

<guess>never</guess>Based on all previous feedback:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Fixed Positions**:
   - Positions 4 (E) and 5 (R) are confirmed correct (✓ from Guess 3 and 4).

2. **N must be at Position 1**:
   - N is present but rules out:
     - Position 2 (Guess 4: `under` → N(-)).
     - Position 3 (Guess 3: `miner` → N(-)).
     - Position 4 (Guess 1: `crane` → N(-)).
     - Position 5 (Guess 2: `stern` → N(-)).
   - Only position 1 remains ⇒ **N must be at position 1**.

3. **Word Structure**:
   - Secret word is **N _ _ E R**.
   - Position 3 is not N (no duplicates indicated).
   - Positions 2 and 3 require distinct letters not excluded.

4. **Absent Letters**:
   - C, A, S, T (from early guesses).
   - M, I (Guess 3).
   - U, D (Guess 4).
   - Letters available: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

5. **Possible Words**:
   - Common candidates fitting `N _ _ E R` include **NEWER** (N,E,W,E,R) or **NEVER** (N,E,V,E,R), despite duplicated E (not explicitly ruled out).
   - Given exclusão lists, **NEVER** is selected as the most common valid word. It tests:
     - N at position 1 (✓ expected).
     - E at position 2 (new test; potential duplicate).
     - V at position 3 (new letter).
     - E/R at 4/5 (✓ confirmed).",Guess 5: never -> FEEDBACK: N(✓) E(✓) V(x) E(✓) R(✓),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 I will choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 Let's go with ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E. These are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the secret word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the secret word)
 N: - (in the word but wrong position)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R, N, and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R is not in position 2, N is not in position 4, and E is not in position 5.
 - The letters C and A are not in the secret word at all.

 We also know that the secret word is 5 letters long.

 We need to make a second guess that:
   - Does not use C or A (since they are absent)
   - Includes R, N, E (but in different positions than in ""crane"")
   - We might also want to include other common letters to test.

 Since R, N, and E are in the word, we can try to place them in new positions.

 In ""crane"", the positions were:
   C (1), R (2), A (3), N (4), E (5)

 So for the next guess, we must avoid:
   - Putting R at position 2
   - Putting N at position 4
   - Putting E at position 5

 Also, we cannot use C or A.

 Let's think of words that have R, N, E and two other letters (which we don't know yet) and that place R, N, E in new positions.

 We can also consider that the word might have repeated letters? But typically in Wordle, words can have repeated letters, but it's less common. Since the feedback didn't indicate any duplicate, we assume no duplicates for now.

 We have three known letters: R, N, E. We need two more letters.

 We can try to use a word that has R, N, E and two new common consonants or vowels.

 Common consonants: T, S, L, etc.

 Let's try to form a word.

 Possibilities:

 We know R cannot be at position 2. So R can be at 1, 3, 4, or 5.
 Similarly, N cannot be at 4, so N can be at 1,2,3,5.
 E cannot be at 5, so E can be at 1,2,3,4.

 We also want to test new letters. Let's try to include 'T' and 'S' for example.

 Example words:

 - ""RENTS"": 
   R at position 1 (which is new for R, since previously R was at 2 -> now 1 is different)
   E at position 2 (previously E was at 5 -> now 2 is different)
   N at position 3 (previously N was at 4 -> now 3 is different)
   T and S are new.

 But note: we don't know if T and S are in the word. This is a way to test.

 Alternatively, ""ROTED"" is not a word. We need valid words.

 Another idea: ""INERT"" -> but we cannot use A and C, but I is allowed? However, we don't know about I. But note: we have to avoid A and C, but other vowels are possible.

 However, we have to be cautious: the word must be valid.

 Let me think of words that have R, N, E and two other letters.

 Some options:

 - ""RENEW"" -> but E is repeated? We don't know if repetition is allowed. Also, E is at position 2 and 4? But we know E is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. However, the feedback for the first guess only showed one E as present, but if there were two, it would have shown two minuses? Actually, the feedback only marks each letter that is present. If a letter is repeated and one is in the correct position, it would show a check for that one and a minus for the other? But in our case, we only had one E and it was marked as minus. So the word might have one E or more? We don't know.

 But to keep it simple, let's avoid duplicates for now.

 Another word: ""ROBIN"" -> but we don't have E? We must include E because we know it's in the word. So we need R, N, and E.

 How about ""DRIVE""? But we don't have N? We must include N because we know it's in the word.

 We must include R, N, and E.

 Let me try: ""RINSE"" -> 
   R at 1 (new position, previously 2 -> so allowed)
   I at 2 (new letter)
   N at 3 (previously at 4, now 3 -> allowed)
   S at 4 (new letter)
   E at 5 -> but wait, in the first guess E was at 5 and we got a minus meaning E is in the word but not at 5. So we cannot put E at 5 again? Actually, we can, but if we put E at 5 and the secret word has E at 5, then we would get a check. But the feedback said E is not at 5, so if we put E at 5 again, we know it will be wrong? Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at 5 again, it will still be wrong. So we should avoid putting E at 5.

 Therefore, in ""RINSE"", E is at 5 -> which is the same position as before. We know that position is wrong, so we should avoid that.

 We need a word that has E not at 5.

 How about ""RENEW""? But that has two E's. And the second E is at 5? So we have E at 2 and 5. We know E is not at 5, so the E at 5 would be wrong, but the E at 2 might be correct? But we don't know. Also, we are using two E's.

 Alternatively, ""URINE"" -> 
   U at 1 (new)
   R at 2 -> but wait, in the first guess R was at 2 and we got a minus meaning R is not at 2. So we cannot put R at 2 again? Actually, we can, but we know it's not at 2 so it will be minus again. We want to try R in a new position.

 So we should avoid putting R at 2, N at 4, and E at 5.

 Let me try to find a word that has:
   R at 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2)
   N at 1,2,3,5 (but not 4)
   E at 1,2,3,4 (but not 5)

 And the word must be 5 letters and not contain C or A.

 Example: ""RODEO"" -> no N and E? Not good.

 Another: ""HORDE"" -> 
   H at 1
   O at 2
   R at 3 -> allowed (since R was at 2, now 3 is new)
   D at 4
   E at 5 -> not allowed (because E cannot be at 5)

 So we avoid E at 5.

 How about ""HORNE""? Not a word.

 ""RENAL"" -> but A is not allowed? We know A is not in the word, so we cannot use A.

 ""RENAL"" has A -> invalid.

 ""REIGN"" -> 
   R at 1 -> allowed (not position 2)
   E at 2 -> allowed (not position 5)
   I at 3
   G at 4
   N at 5 -> allowed (not position 4)

 This seems good: 
   Positions: R(1), E(2), I(3), G(4), N(5)

 We are testing R at 1, E at 2, and N at 5. Also, we are introducing I and G.

 So let's go with ""REIGN"".

 But note: we are not using the fact that in the first word, we had R at 2 and now we are putting R at 1. Similarly, E was at 5 and now at 2, and N was at 4 and now at 5.

 This is a valid guess.

 Alternatively, we could try ""ROUTE"" -> but E at 5 is not allowed.

 Another option: ""SERIF"" -> 
   S at 1
   E at 2 -> allowed
   R at 3 -> allowed (not 2)
   I at 4
   F at 5

 But we are missing N? We must include N because we know it's in the word. So we cannot leave out N.

 Therefore, we must have R, N, and E in the guess.

 So ""REIGN"" is a valid word that includes R, N, E and avoids the forbidden positions.

 Let me check if ""REIGN"" is a valid English word: yes, it means to rule.

 So I will guess ""REIGN"".

 However, note that we are also trying to test new letters. We are testing I and G, which we haven't tried before.

 We might also consider ""NERDY"" -> 
   N at 1 -> allowed (not 4)
   E at 2 -> allowed (not 5)
   R at 3 -> allowed (not 2)
   D at 4
   Y at 5

 But we don't know about D and Y. And ""NERDY"" is a word.

 But we have to choose one. Let me compare:

 ""REIGN"" and ""NERDY""

 Both are valid. But ""REIGN"" uses G and I, while ""NERDY"" uses D and Y.

 We might want to use more common letters. G is more common than Y? And D is common.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ENTER"" -> 
   E at 1 -> allowed (not 5)
   N at 2 -> allowed (not 4)
   T at 3
   E at 4 -> but wait, we are repeating E? We don't know if the word has two E's. Also, we are putting E at 1 and 4. The feedback for the first guess only showed one E, but that doesn't mean there isn't two. However, we are using two E's and we only know one is present. This might be inefficient.

 So I think ""REIGN"" is a good choice.

 Let me see if there's a word that uses more common letters. For example, including T or S.

 How about ""RENTS"": 
   R at 1 -> allowed
   E at 2 -> allowed
   N at 3 -> allowed (previously at 4, now 3 is new)
   T at 4 -> but wait, N was at 4 in the first guess and we got a minus meaning N is not at 4. But now we are putting T at 4? That's fine. And S at 5.

 But E is at 2 and we are not repeating. Also, we are including T and S, which are common.

 However, we have to avoid putting E at 5? We are not. But note: we are putting N at 3 and E at 2, which are new positions.

 But what about the letter S? We don't know if it's in the word.

 Also, in ""RENTS"", we have R, E, N, T, S. That's five distinct letters? Yes.

 And the positions: 
   R:1 (new), E:2 (new), N:3 (new), T:4, S:5.

 We are testing T and S, which are common.

 But note: we are not using the fact that we know E is in the word? We are using E, so that's good.

 However, we are putting E at 2. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 Also, we are putting N at 3, which is a new position.

 But wait: in the first guess, we had R at 2 and now we are putting R at 1. That's good.

 So ""RENTS"" is also a good candidate.

 Which one to choose? 

 We want to maximize information. ""RENTS"" uses T and S, which are very common. ""REIGN"" uses I and G, which are less common.

 So ""RENTS"" might be better.

 But note: we are putting E at 2 and we don't know if that's correct. Also, we are putting N at 3 and T at 4 and S at 5.

 Alternatively, we can try ""STERN"": 
   S at 1
   T at 2
   E at 3 -> allowed (not 5)
   R at 4 -> allowed (not 2)
   N at 5 -> allowed (not 4)

 This also includes R, N, E and uses S and T.

 And the positions are all new for R, N, E.

 So ""STERN"" is another option.

 Let me compare:

 ""RENTS"": R1, E2, N3, T4, S5
 ""STERN"": S1, T2, E3, R4, N5

 Both are valid.

 But note: in ""STERN"", we are putting R at 4 and N at 5. We haven't tried these positions.

 Also, we are testing S and T in both.

 I think ""STERN"" might be slightly better because it places R and N in positions we haven't tested at all (4 and 5) and E in 3.

 But we are also testing S at 1 and T at 2.

 Alternatively, we can choose ""ROUSE"" -> but E at 5 is not allowed.

 After consideration, I think ""STERN"" is a good choice.

 However, we must avoid using A and C, and both ""RENTS"" and ""STERN"" are safe.

 I'll go with ""STERN"" because it uses common letters and tests new positions.

 But note: we have to make sure we don't use any forbidden letters. We know the secret word does not contain C or A. ""STERN"" has S, T, E, R, N -> no C or A. Good.

 So let's choose ""STERN"".

 Alternatively, we can choose ""RENEW"" but that has two E's and we don't know if that's necessary. Also, E at 5 is not allowed? Actually, ""RENEW"" has E at 2 and 5. We know E is not at 5, so the E at 5 would be a waste? But if the word has two E's, then we might get a minus for the E at 5. But we don't know. So it's better to avoid duplicates for now.

 Therefore, I choose ""STERN"".

 But wait, in the first guess, we had R at 2 and we got a minus. Now in ""STERN"", we are putting R at 4. Similarly, E was at 5 and now at 3, and N was at 4 and now at 5. So we are testing new positions.

 So the second guess: ""STERN""

 Let me write it: S T E R N

 But note: the word is ""stern"".

 We'll see the feedback.

 However, note: the feedback for the first guess had R, N, and E as present. So we are including them.

 So I'll go with ""STERN"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C and A are absent (x), so they can be excluded from future guesses.
- R, N, and E are present (-) but in incorrect positions. Specifically:
  - R cannot be in position 2.
  - N cannot be in position 4.
  - E cannot be in position 5.

For the second guess, I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Includes R, N, and E (since they are confirmed present).
2. Avoids C and A (confirmed absent).
3. Places R, N, and E in new positions (not 2, 4, and 5 respectively).
4. Tests new common letters (like S and T) for maximum information.

The word ""stern"" fits all criteria:
- Contains R (position 4), N (position 5), and E (position 3) — all in new positions.
- Uses S and T (common letters not yet tested).
- Avoids C and A.
- Is a valid English word.

This guess will help narrow down the positions of R, N, E and test S and T efficiently.

<guess>stern</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: stern -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) E(-) R(-) N(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: - (in word, wrong position)
  A: x (not in word)
  N: - (in word, wrong position)
  E: - (in word, wrong position)

From this, we know:
- The secret word contains R, N, E (each at least once).
- It does not contain C or A.
- R is not at position 2.
- N is not at position 4.
- E is not at position 5.

Guess 2: ""stern""
  S: x (not in word)
  T: x (not in word)
  E: - (in word, wrong position)
  R: - (in word, wrong position)
  N: - (in word, wrong position)

From this, we know:
- The secret word does not contain S or T.
- E is in the word but not at position 3 (since ""stern"" has E at position 3 and it got a minus).
- R is in the word but not at position 4 (since ""stern"" has R at position 4 and it got a minus).
- N is in the word but not at position 5 (since ""stern"" has N at position 5 and it got a minus).

We also know that E is not at position 5 (from guess1) and not at position 3 (from guess2). Similarly, R is not at position 2 (guess1) and not at position 4 (guess2). N is not at position 4 (guess1) and not at position 5 (guess2).

So summary:

Letters in the word: R, N, E (definitely at least once each)
Letters not in the word: C, A, S, T

We need to include R, N, E and two new letters.

Position constraints:

For R:
Cannot be at: 2 (from ""crane"") and 4 (from ""stern"")
So possible positions: 1, 3, 5

For N:
Cannot be at: 4 (from ""crane"") and 5 (from ""stern"")
So possible positions: 1, 2, 3

For E:
Cannot be at: 5 (from ""crane"") and 3 (from ""stern"")
So possible positions: 1, 2, 4

We have used up two guesses and have four left.

We need to choose a word that:
- Contains R, N, E
- Does not contain C, A, S, T
- Places R, N, E in positions that are still possible according to the constraints.

Also, we must introduce two new letters to test.

We have already tested: C, R, A, N, E, S, T (7 letters). So the remaining letters are many, but we need common ones.

We can use letters like: L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with R, N, E and two others.

We need to form a valid word.

We also have to consider the positions: R must be at 1,3,5; N at 1,2,3; E at 1,2,4.

We can try to fix the positions and look for words.

For example, let R be at position 3 (one of the options). Then what?

Possible word structures.

Let me think of words containing R, N, E.

Since E has only three possible positions (1,2,4), and R has three (1,3,5), and N has three (1,2,3), we need overlap.

We cannot have repeated letters? We don't know, but in the feedback so far, there has been no indication of duplicates. So we assume no duplicates for now.

So let E be at position 4. Then we have positions 1,2,3,5 to place R and N (and two other letters).

But E at 4: then positions:
1: ?
2: ?
3: ?
5: ?

N must be at 1,2,3 (since it cannot be at 4 or 5). Similarly, R must be at 1,3,5.

If E is at 4, then position 4 is taken by E.

Then for N: can be at 1,2,3.

For R: can be at 1,3,5.

But if R is at 3, and E at 4, then the word might be ? ? R E ?

But N must be in one of 1,2,3.

For example, if N at 1: then word: N ? R E ?

If N at 2: word: ? N R E ?

If N at 3: but R might also be at 3? But we assume distinct, so they can't both be at 3. So if E is at 4, position 3 must be either R or N? But we have to assign.

Actually, position 3 can be R or one of the new letters, and similarly.

But let's look for actual words.

Try E at position 4.

Possible words:

- ENDER: but has E at 2? And E at 5? We have E at 4, but also E at 2 and 5? That's multiple E's? But let's see structure.

We need E only once? We don't know.

But try: words like ""RENEW"" has E at 2 and 5 -> not good because E cannot be at 5.

Other words: How about ""LINER""? But we don't know if L and I are in the word.

""LINER"": 
Position 1: L
Position 2: I
Position 3: N
Position 4: E
Position 5: R

Check constraints:
R: at 5 -> allowed (since R can be at 1,3,5)
N: at 3 -> allowed (N can be at 1,2,3)
E: at 4 -> allowed (E can be at 1,2,4)

Also, L and I are new letters (not tested yet).

Also, no C,A,S,T -> good.

Is ""LINER"" a word? Yes, meaning an ocean liner or a person who lines.

So this is a valid guess.

But note: we have N at position 3 and E at 4. In ""crane"", N was at 4 (which is not allowed, but now N at 3) and E was at 5 (not allowed, but now E at 4).

Also, R was at 2 in ""crane"" (not allowed) and now R at 5.

So this word satisfies all position constraints.

We can have other options.

For example, with E at position 4, R at 5, and N at 1: then word structure: N ? ? E R

What words fit? e.g., ""NUDER""? Not a word. ""NEWER"" has two E's? E at 4, but E at 2? And E at 4? And E cannot be at 5? But ""NEWER"" has E at 2 and 5? Not good.

With E at position 4, R at 5, and N at 2: word: ? N ? E R -> e.g., ""INNER"" has two N's? Not good. Or ""MINER"": M at 1, I at 2? Then N at 3? But we need N at 2? ""MINER"" is M I N E R -> positions: N at 3, E at 4, R at 5. So N at 3 (allowed), E at 4 (allowed), R at 5 (allowed). Then the second letter is I? So word: M I N E R.

""M"" and ""I"" are new letters.

""MINER"" is a word.

Similarly, we could have ""LINER"" as above.

Another option: E at position 4, R at 3, and N somewhere? But R at 3: so positions 1,2 have letters? Then E at 4, then 5.

N can be at 1 or 2.

If N at 1: word: N ? R E ? -> e.g., ""NARES"" but has A -> invalid. ""NORES"" but O? And we don't have A, but O? Also, ""NORES"" is not common? Actually, ""N"" something ""R"" ""E"" S -> but S is invalid? We know S is not in the word.

We cannot use S.

So perhaps not.

With E at other positions.

For example, E at position 1: allowed? E can be at 1,2,4.

Then if E at 1, then word must be E ? ? ? ?

Then R must be at 3 or 5? Or at 1? But 1 is E, so R cannot be at 1. So R at 3 or 5.

N must be at 1? But 1 is E, so cannot have N at 1? So N must be at 2 or 3.

But position 1 is E.

So E at 1.

Possible: word E _ _ _ _

For N: can be position 2 or 3.

For R: can be position 3 or 5.

If N at 2: and R at 3: then E at 1, N at 2, R at 3 -> then positions 4 and 5 are new letters.

Word: E N R ? ? 

What words? ""ENROL"" but has O and L? But O is allowed? But the word has E at 1, N at 2, R at 3, O at 4, L at 5.

But N at 2: allowed? Yes.

R at 3: allowed? Yes (R cannot be at 2 or 4, but 3 is okay).

But we have O and L.

Is this a word? ""ENROL"" -> yes.

But note: we don't know if O and L are in the word.

Similarly, we could have other words.

But let's compare with ""MINER"" or ""LINER"".

Another structure: E at position 2.

Then word: ? E ? ? ?

E at position 2: allowed.

Then R possible positions: 1,3,5 (since cannot be 2 or 4? Wait, R cannot be at 2, but E is at 2? So no problem. R can be at 1,3,5)

N possible positions: 1,2,3? But 2 is E, so N can only be at 1 or 3.

So if E at 2:

Then N at 1 or 3.

R at 1,3,5? But if N at 1, then R can be at 3 or 5? Not at 1.

If N at 1: then R at 3 or 5.

Then word: N E ? ? R  or N E ? R ?  (if R at 3 or 5)

For example: N E R ? ? -> but R at 3? And E at 2.

Word: ""NERDY"" but we know D and Y? But also, we know S and T are invalid? S and T are out, but D and Y we don't know.

""Nerdy"" has positions: N1, E2, R3, D4, Y5.

Constraints: N at 1: allowed (N positions:1,2,3)
E at 2: allowed? Yes (since E must not be at 3 or 5? E cannot be at 3? From ""stern"", E at 3 got minus? And cannot be at 5 from ""crane"". But position 2 is new? Yes, so allowed.

But note: E was at 5 in ""crane"" and not at 3 in ""stern"", so position 2 is indeed available.

Similarly, R at 3: allowed? R cannot be at 2 or 4? 3 is allowed? Yes.

So ""NERDY"" is possible: letters N, E, R, D, Y -> no C,A,S,T -> valid.

But is Y a common letter? Not very, but possible.

Alternatively, N E and then position 3 and 4,5.

Examples: N E S S T -> but S and T are invalid.

Not possible.

Another: N E W E R -> two E's? and E not at 5? But position 5 is R? Actually, ""newer"" has E at 2 and 5? But E cannot be at 5? So if we guess ""NEWER"", E at 5 would be wrong.

But we have E at position 5 again? We should avoid since we know E is not at 5.

Therefore, ""NERDY"" or ""MINER"" or ""LINER"" or ""ENROL"".

We need to pick one.

Also, we must maximize information. So we want to test common unused letters.

Unused letters so far: all except C,A,S,T,R,N,E (and the ones used in guesses, but only c,a,n,e,r,s,t).

So guess1: c,r,a,n,e -> letters tested: C,R,A,N,E
guess2: s,t,e,r,n -> letters tested: S,T,E,R,N

So tested: A, C, E, N, R, S, T.

So unused: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want common letters: e.g., L, I, O, D, U, M, P, etc.

We can calculate frequency, but roughly.

For now, I think ""LINER"" is a good choice because it uses L and I, which are common vowels and consonants.

Similarly, ""MINER"" uses M and I.

""NERDY"" uses D and Y.

""ENROL"" uses O and L.

""LINER"" uses L and I.

We can choose ""LINER"" or ""MINER"".

Let me pick ""MINER"" because M is a common consonant.

""MINER"" structure:
Position 1: M
Position 2: I
Position 3: N
Position 4: E
Position 5: R

Constraints:
E at 4: allowed (E possible positions 1,2,4)
N at 3: allowed (N possible positions 1,2,3)
R at 5: allowed (R possible positions 1,3,5)

And M and I are new.

We haven't tested M or I.

Thus, a good guess.

We could also do ""LINER"" with L at 1 and I at 2.

But both are valid.

I think ""MINER"" is slightly better? Or not sure.

Another word: ""DINER"" -> 
Position 1: D
Position 2: I
Position 3: N
Position 4: E
Position 5: R? 

But E at 4: allowed? Yes.
N at 3: allowed? Yes.
R at 5: allowed? Yes.

And D and I are new.

Also valid.

But ""miner"" is more common? 

Since we have to choose, I'll go with ""miner"".

But note: we don't know if M is in the word. We are testing it.

If M is absent, we get an 'x' for M, which is useful.

Similarly, for I.

So I think ""MINER"" is a reasonable guess.

After research, I found that ""miner"" is an appropriate word to use.

So the third guess: ""MINER""

In the response format, we output the guess.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: R, N, and E are present but in incorrect positions (R not in position 2, N not in position 4, E not in position 5). C and A are absent.
- **Guess 2 (stern)**: E, R, and N are present but in incorrect positions (E not in position 3, R not in position 4, N not in position 5). S and T are absent.

Key deductions:
- The secret word contains R, N, and E (each at least once), and excludes C, A, S, T.
- Position constraints:
  - R can only be in positions 1, 3, or 5 (not 2 or 4).
  - N can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (not 4 or 5).
  - E can only be in positions 1, 2, or 4 (not 3 or 5).
- The word must be 5 letters, using only untested letters besides R, N, E (e.g., avoiding C, A, S, T).

For this guess, ""MINER"" is selected because:
- It includes R, N, E (required).
- It avoids forbidden letters (C, A, S, T).
- It places R, N, E in valid positions based on constraints:
  - R at position 5 (allowed).
  - N at position 3 (allowed).
  - E at position 4 (allowed).
- It introduces two new common letters (M and I) for testing.

<guess>miner</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: stern -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) E(-) R(-) N(-)
Guess 3: miner -> FEEDBACK: M(x) I(x) N(-) E(✓) R(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the third guess ""miner"":
 M: x (not in the word)
 I: x (not in the word)
 N: - (in the word but wrong position)
 E: ✓ (correct position)
 R: ✓ (correct position)

 So, from ""miner"":
 - E is in the word and in the correct position: position 4.
 - R is in the word and in the correct position: position 5.
 - N is in the word but not in position 3 (since we got a minus for N at position 3).
 - M and I are not in the word.

 Also, from previous guesses, we know:
 - The secret word contains R, N, E (which we already knew) and now we know E is at position 4 and R is at position 5.
 - We also know that N is not at position 3 (from this guess) and not at position 4 (from guess1) and not at position 5 (from guess2). But position 5 is R, so that's consistent. Also, from guess1, N was not at 4, and now we know E is at 4, so that's good.

 Now, the secret word has:
   Position 4: E
   Position 5: R

 And N is in the word but not at position 3, and not at 4 or 5 (which are taken). So N must be at position 1 or 2.

 Also, we know from guess1 that R was not at position 2 (which we already knew, and now R is at 5, so that's fine) and from guess2 that R was not at 4 (and now we have R at 5, so also fine).

 We also know that E is at 4, so it cannot be at 1 or 2 (but we already knew E was not at 5, and now we know it's at 4).

 Now, the word structure is: _ _ _ E R

 We know N is at either position 1 or 2.

 We also have two more letters to fill: the first and second positions (if N is at 1, then position 2 is another letter; if N is at 2, then position 1 is another letter). And position 3 is still unknown, but we know it's not N (because in ""miner"" we had N at 3 and it was wrong) and not E or R (since they are at 4 and 5).

 Also, we know the word does not contain: C, A, S, T, M, I.

 We need to find a word that fits: _ _ _ E R, with N in position 1 or 2, and the other two positions (the remaining one and position 3) are filled with letters that are not C, A, S, T, M, I.

 We also know that the word must contain N (which we are placing at 1 or 2) and the other two letters.

 Let's consider the possibilities:

 Case 1: N at position 1
   Word: N _ _ E R
   Then position 2 and 3 are two other letters.

 Case 2: N at position 2
   Word: _ N _ E R
   Then position 1 and 3 are two other letters.

 We need to find valid English words that fit one of these patterns and use only letters not excluded.

 Excluded letters: A, C, I, M, S, T.

 We can use: B, D, E (but E is already placed), F, G, H, J, K, L, N (but we are using it), O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 But note: we have to use two more distinct letters? We don't know if there are duplicates, but so far no duplicates have been indicated.

 We can try to list possible words.

 First, case 1: N at 1 -> N _ _ E R

 Possible words:
   N U D E R -> ""NUDER"" (not a word)
   N A G E R -> but A is excluded -> invalid
   N O G E R -> ""NOGER"" (not a word)
   N U K E R -> ""NUKER"" (a word, meaning one that nukes)
   N I K E R -> but I is excluded -> invalid
   N O K E R -> ""NOKER"" (not a word)
   N O V E R -> ""NOVER"" (not a word)
   N E V E R -> but E at position 2? And we have E at 4. But ""NEVER"" has two E's? And E at position 2: but we don't know if E is duplicated? However, in the first guess, we had E and it was marked as present (but not at 5) and now we have E at 4. If there is another E, it might be possible. But in ""NEVER"", we have E at 2 and 4. So if we guess ""NEVER"", then:
        Position 1: N -> but we are considering N at 1, which is allowed? But we know N is not at 3, but we don't know about position 1. However, in this case, we are putting N at 1 and E at 2 and 4, and R at 5.

        But we have to check the feedback: 
          In ""miner"", we had E at 4 correct, so if there is an E at 2, that would be a new E? But the feedback for ""miner"" didn't show an extra E? Actually, in ""miner"", we had only one E (at position 4) and it was correct. The feedback for E was a check, meaning that E is at 4. The other letters: M, I, N, R. The N was present but wrong position, and R was correct. There was no indication of a second E? But if the word had two E's, then in ""miner"" we only tested one E (at 4) and it was correct, so the other E (if at 2) would not have been tested. So it's possible.

        However, we are not sure. But let's see if ""NEVER"" is a valid word? Yes.

        But we have to check the constraints for N: in ""NEVER"", N is at 1 -> allowed (since N can be at 1 or 2). 
        Also, E at 2: but we know E can be at 1,2,4? And we have E at 4 already. But the feedback from guess1 and guess2 didn't rule out E at 2? 
          - In guess1, E was at 5 and got minus -> so E is not at 5, but 2 is different.
          - In guess2, E was at 3 and got minus -> so E is not at 3, but 2 is different.
          So E at 2 is allowed.

        However, we have two E's? The secret word might have two E's? We don't know.

        But note: in the first guess ""crane"", we had one E and it was marked as present (minus) meaning there is at least one E. Now we have E at 4 (correct) and if we put E at 2, that would be a second E? But we don't know if the word has two E's.

        We can try ""NEVER"", but we are not forced to. We can avoid duplicates if possible.

        But let's see other words.

   Other words: ""NAKER"" -> not a word, and A is excluded.
   ""NAB E R"" -> A excluded.

   How about ""NUDER""? Not a word.

   ""NUKER"": N at 1, U at 2, K at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> valid word? Yes, meaning one that nukes.

   And U and K are not excluded.

   So ""NUKER"" is a possibility.

   Also, ""NONER"" -> not a word.

   ""NOYER"" -> not a word.

   ""NOHOW"" -> not ending with ER.

   So ""NUKER"" is one.

 Case 2: N at position 2 -> _ N _ E R

 Possible words:
   B N E E R -> ""BNEER"" not a word.
   D N E E R -> ""DNEER"" not a word.
   F N E E R -> not a word.
   G N E E R -> ""GNEER"" not a word.
   H N E E R -> not a word.
   J N E E R -> not a word.
   K N E E R -> not a word.
   L N E E R -> not a word.
   O N E E R -> ""ONEER"" not a word.
   P N E E R -> not a word.
   Q N E E R -> not a word.
   U N E E R -> not a word.
   V N E E R -> not a word.
   W N E E R -> not a word.
   X N E E R -> not a word.
   Y N E E R -> not a word.
   Z N E E R -> not a word.

   What about ""ONCER""? But C is excluded.

   How about ""UNDER""? 
        U at 1, N at 2, D at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> ""UNDER""
        This is a valid word.

        Constraints: 
          N at 2: allowed (N can be at 1,2,3 -> 2 is allowed)
          E at 4: correct (we know)
          R at 5: correct (we know)
          U and D are new letters.

        And no excluded letters.

        So ""UNDER"" is a valid word.

   Also, ""UNGER"": U at 1, N at 2, G at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> ""UNGER"" is a surname? But it's a valid word? Actually, it might be accepted as a proper noun, but in Wordle, common words are used. ""UNGER"" is not common. 

   ""UNPER""? Not a word.

   ""UNMET""? But ends with T? T is excluded.

   ""UNZIP""? But Z and P, but ends with P? We need ER at the end.

   So ""UNDER"" is a common word.

   Also, ""OWNER"": O at 1, W at 2, N at 3? But we need N at 2? ""OWNER"" has N at 3? So not.

   ""INNER"": I is excluded and N at 2? ""INNER"" has I at 1, N at 2, N at 3? Duplicate N? And I is excluded.

   ""HONER"": H at 1, O at 2, N at 3? But we need N at 2? So not.

   So the main candidates are:
        Case 1: ""NUKER"" (N at 1)
        Case 2: ""UNDER"" (N at 2)

 We have two possibilities.

 We need to choose one.

 We can also consider if there are other words.

 Another word for case 1: ""NAZER""? Not a word.

 For case 2: ""UNGER"" might be accepted? But ""UNDER"" is better.

 Also, ""ONERY"" -> but not ending with ER.

 So between ""NUKER"" and ""UNDER"", which one to choose?

 We know that in the word, we have E at 4 and R at 5, and N at either 1 or 2.

 We also know that in the first guess, we had N at 4 (which is now E) and it was present but wrong position. In the second guess, N at 5 (which is now R) and it was present but wrong position. In the third guess, N at 3 and it was present but wrong position.

 So N has been tried at positions 3,4,5 and all were wrong. So it must be at 1 or 2.

 Now, we can choose a word that tests one of these.

 But note: we have only two possibilities? Actually, no, because the other letters matter.

 However, we can choose a word that will help us distinguish.

 But we have two candidates: ""NUKER"" and ""UNDER"". They are both possible.

 We can also think of other words? For example, ""FJORD"" but doesn't end with ER.

 We must end with ER.

 Another word: ""OUNCE"" but not ending with ER.

 So let's list all possible words:

 For pattern _ _ _ E R:

 With N at 1: 
   N _ _ E R -> we have ""NUKER"" (and maybe others? ""NAKER"" not a word, ""NIXER"" has I, ""NOYER"" not, ""NUBER"" not, ""NUDER"" not, ""NUMER"" not, ""NURSE"" has S -> invalid, ""NUTTY"" not, etc.) So only ""NUKER"" seems common.

 With N at 2:
   _ N _ E R -> we have ""UNDER"", and also ""ANGER"" but A excluded, ""INKER"" I excluded, ""ONCER"" C excluded, ""OWNER"" has N at 3? No, ""OWNER"" is O W N E R -> N at 3, not 2. 
   ""HONEY"" not ending with ER.

   ""JNANA"" not.

   So only ""UNDER"" is common.

   Also, ""UNLED"" not ending with ER.

   ""UNMET"" has T.

   So ""UNDER"" is the main candidate for N at 2.

   Another: ""UNWED"" not.

   ""UNZIP"" not.

   So we have two candidates: ""NUKER"" and ""UNDER"".

 We can choose one to guess. Since we have two possibilities, we can pick one arbitrarily, but we have to make a guess.

 Alternatively, we can think of a word that tests both possibilities? But we have to fill the entire word.

 We can guess ""NUKER"" and if it's not, then ""UNDER"" must be the word.

 But we have to use one guess.

 Let's see the frequency: ""UNDER"" is more common than ""NUKER"". So perhaps ""UNDER"" is more likely.

 But we don't know.

 We can also consider that in ""miner"", we had N at 3 and it was present but wrong. If the word were ""NUKER"", then N is at 1, which is a new position. Similarly, for ""UNDER"", N is at 2.

 We have no information about position 1 or 2 for N.

 So we can choose ""UNDER"" because it's a more common word.

 But note: we have to avoid excluded letters. Both are safe.

 I'll go with ""UNDER"".

 But wait: in ""UNDER"", we have U at 1 and D at 3. We haven't tested U or D.

 Similarly, in ""NUKER"", we have U at 2 and K at 3.

 We are testing new letters in both.

 But ""UNDER"" is a very common word.

 So the fourth guess: ""UNDER""

 If it's not, then we try ""NUKER"" next.

 But we have two guesses left? We are at guess 4, and we have 6 tries.

 So we can do that.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that tests the presence of U? But we are forced to use one of these patterns.

 I think ""UNDER"" is a good guess.

 So let's go with ""UNDER"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: R, N, E are present (but misplaced); C and A are absent.
- **Guess 2 (stern)**: E, R, N are present (but misplaced); S and T are absent.
- **Guess 3 (miner)**: 
  - E (position 4) and R (position 5) are correct (✓).
  - N is present but misplaced (-), so it cannot be in position 3.
  - M and I are absent (x).

### Key Deductions:
1. **Fixed positions**: 
   - Position 4 must be **E**.
   - Position 5 must be **R**.
   - The word ends with **ER**.
2. **N constraints**: 
   - N is in the word but cannot be in positions 3, 4 (from Guess 1), or 5 (from Guess 2). Thus, N must be in position **1 or 2**.
3. **Absent letters**: C, A, S, T, M, I (cannot appear in the word).
4. **Word structure**: `_ _ _ E R` (with N in position 1 or 2).

### Analysis for Next Guess:
- The secret word must be 5 letters, ending with ""ER"", with N at position 1 or 2, and no excluded letters.
- Possible candidates:
  - **N at position 1**: Words like **NUKER** (N _ _ E R). However, ""NUKER"" is uncommon.
  - **N at position 2**: Words like **UNDER** (_ N _ E R), which is a common word and fits all constraints.
- **UNDER** is chosen because:
  - It places N in position 2 (valid, as N cannot be in 3/4/5).
  - It uses new letters (U, D) to test their presence.
  - It adheres to all feedback and excluded letters.

<guess>under</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: stern -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) E(-) R(-) N(-)
Guess 3: miner -> FEEDBACK: M(x) I(x) N(-) E(✓) R(✓)
Guess 4: under -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) D(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for Guess 4: ""under"" -> U(x) N(-) D(x) E(✓) R(✓)

From this:
- U is absent (x) → The secret word contains no U.
- N is present but not in position 2 (-) → So N is in the word, but not at position 2.
- D is absent (x) → The secret word contains no D.
- E and R are in the correct positions (✓) → Position 4 is E and position 5 is R.

Previous feedback helps us consolidate information:

From Guess 3 (""miner""):
- E is at position 4 (✓)
- R is at position 5 (✓)
- N is present but not at position 3 (-)
- M and I are absent (x)

From Guess 1 (""crane""):
- N is present but not at position 4 (-) → We already know E is at position 4, so consistent.
- E is present but not at position 5 (-) → We have E at 4 and R at 5, so position 5 is R, not E.

From Guess 2 (""stern""):
- N is present but not at position 5 (-) → Consistent since position 5 is R.

So, summarizing:
1. Positions 4 and 5 are fixed: E and R.
2. N must be in the word, but cannot be at:
   - Position 3 (from ""miner"")
   - Position 4 (from ""crane"" → fixed as E)
   - Position 5 (from ""stern"" → fixed as R)
   - Position 2 (from ""under"")
   So N must be at position 1 (the only position left).

We also know the absent letters: A, C, I, M, S, T, U, D.

Thus, the secret word has structure:
N _ _ E R

Now, we know the word starts with N, ends with ER, and we need the second and third letters.

We must be careful:
- The word is N ? ? E R
- The third character (position 3) cannot be N (since N is at position 1, and duplicates? We have no evidence of duplicates, but we should consider if necessary. However, the feedback has never indicated duplicates, so we assume distinct letters except when forced).

But note: we have not had any duplicate marks. Especially in the feedback for ""under"", we have only one N mark (as misplaced at position 2) and no indication of multiple N's. Similarly in previous guesses. So likely, only one N.

Therefore: positions 2 and 3 are two distinct letters that are not N, and are not any of the absent letters: A, C, D, I, M, S, T, U.

But note: E and R are already placed? So they are taken? So we need letters that are not E, R, N? Because each letter appears once? We are not forced, but without duplication signs, we assume distinct.

Therefore, we need two distinct, unused letters for positions 2 and 3.

Excluded letters so far: A, C, D, I, M, S, T, U.

Also, from guesses, we have tested: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, E, R, N (from first two guesses), M, I, N, E, R (guess 3), U, N, D, E, R (guess 4). So the letters we know are absent are: A, C, D, I, M, S, T, U.

We can use: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a word: N ? ? E R

Possible words?

Let's think of English words: N ? ? E R

- ""N**O**W E R"" -> ""NOWER"" not common; not valid?
- ""N**E**E R"" → E at position 2? But we have E at 4? And ""NEER"" is not a standalone word? It's poetic for ""never"". Not typically accepted.
- ""N**I**C E R"" → I and C excluded? C is absent, I absent → invalid.
- ""N**A**Z E R"" → A is absent → invalid.
- ""N**O**B E R"" → ""NOBER"" not a word.
- ""N**O**K E R"" → not common.
- ""N**O**V E R"" → ""NOVER"" not a word.
- ""N**U**G E R"" → U is absent → invalid.
- ""N**O**G E R"" → Not a word.
- ""N**O**Y E R"" → ""NOYER"" not common.
- ""N**L**? Weird.

Common words:

- ""N A G E R"" → A excluded.
- ""N I C E R"" → excluded.
- What about ""N E W E R"" → ""NEWER"" → has two E's? And E at 2 and 4? 
  - If we try ""NEWER"": 
    - Positions: N1, E2, W3, E4, R5
    - We already know E at 4 is correct. Now E at 2: that would be a second E? 
    - Is a second E possible? We haven't explicitly ruled it out. The feedback for ""miner"" had only one E (at 4) marked correct. We didn't test position 2 with E? 
    - So it's possible? 
    - But then: the E at position 2 would be a new E? But in ""under"" we didn't test position 2 with E? It was N at position 2.

  However, in ""under"" guess, we had U at 1 (absent), N at 2 (present but wrong → so N is not at 2, but if E was at 2, then we haven't tested that? Actually, in ""under"" we did not test E at position 2? We had U at 1, N at 2, D at 3, E at 4, R at 5. The feedback for position 2 was N (which got a minus), meaning that N is present but not at 2. It doesn't say anything about E? But position 2 was occupied by N, not E.

  So the secret word having E at 2 is possible? Only if E is duplicated. Because E at 2 is not at 4? We know E at 4 is correct. 

  To avoid complexity, perhaps assume no duplicates? Since we haven't seen any.

  But let me see: previous guesses tested only one E? In ""crane"", E was at 5; in ""stern"", E at 3; in ""miner"", E at 4 (correct); in ""under"", E at 4 (correct). So position 2 has never been tested? And we don't know if E is duplicated? 

  However, given that only position 1 remains for N, we must consider words with N at 1 and any letters at 2 and 3.

  ""NEWER"" is a valid word? Yes.

  But we have ""E"" twice? We don't know? We can test.

  Another option: ""NUKER"" but U is excluded → we learned U is absent in guess 4.

  ""NUKER"" is invalid because U is absent.

  Similarly, ""NUDER"" has D and U? Both absent? Invalid.

  Now, ""NEWER"": N1, E2, W3, E4, R5.

  Constraints: 
  - N at 1: allowed? Yes (since N must be at 1 or 2? Now we know N must be at 1 because position 2 is ruled out by guess 4? Yes: from guess 4, N cannot be at 2, and positions 3,4,5 are out? So N must be at position 1. So that's fine.
  - E at 4: correct? We know that's fixed.
  - R at 5: fixed.
  - At position 2: E? Would that be a duplicate E? We don't know? 
  - But the word ""NEWER"" is common? Yes.

  However, we have E at position 2? That is, the secret word would have E at 2 and 4? But we only knew about one E? But it's possible.

  Also, included letter W? We haven't tested W.

  But let's check against feedback: 

  We know the secret word has E at 4 and R at 5. In guessing ""NEWER"", we would test:

    Position 1: N → if N is at 1, it will be correct? We suspect N is at 1? 
    Position 2: E → is E present? But we already have E at 4? So if there is another E, it would show as minus or check? 
    Actually, in ""NEWER"", we have E at 2 and E at 4. The E at 4 would show as check? The E at 2? We haven't placed E at 2 before? 

  But in the feedback rules: 
    ✓: letter in correct position
    -: letter in word but not this position
    x: letter not in word

  If we guess ""NEWER"" and the secret word has only one E (at position 4), then:
    Position 1: N? If N is at 1, check? 
    Position 2: E? But the secret word does not have E at 2? And if no duplicate, then this E is not present? So it would be x? 

  But we think the secret word has N at 1? Then position 1 N is ✓, position 4 E ✓, position 5 R ✓? Position 2 E? If the word has no other E, then E at 2 would be x? Position 3 W: if not in the word, x.

  But we are almost sure that N is at 1? 

  Alternatively, the word could be ""NONER""? But not a word? 

  Another possibility: ""NOYER""? Not a word? 

Common words: ""NEWER"" or ""NEVER""?

  ""NEVER"": N1, E2, V3, E4, R5.

  That seems a very common word.

  With V? We haven't tested V.

  Now, we can choose ""NEVER"".

  Why? Because it uses V? 

  But note: we have 6 tries? This is guess 5? We have to get it.

  We are certain about positions 1,4,5? Only position 1 is not 100% confirmed? We deduced N must be at 1? 

  How sure? 

  From all constraints: 
    N must be in the word. 
    Tried at positions: 2 (under: no), 3 (miner: no), 4 (crane: no), 5 (stern: no). Only position 1 left? 

  So positions 5 and 4 are taken? Position 3 cannot have N because miner feedback: N was at 3 and got a minus? Position 2 cannot have N because under feedback: N at 2 and got minus? 

  So absolute: N must be at position 1.

  Therefore, the word is N _ _ E R.

  So we don't need to hope for ""NEWER"" with duplicate E? That was just an example.

  Now, for the second and third positions: two distinct letters from the available set. 

  We need to list possible words.

  N _ _ E R

  Possibilities:

  - With second letter O: 
      ""N_O_ER"": ""NO?ER"" -> ""NOVER"", ""NOBER"", ""NOGER"" → all not words? 
      ""NONER"" → not common? 
      ""NOW ER"" → not words.

  - With second letter L:
      ""NL?ER"" → ""NLYER"" no? ""NILER"" has I → invalid.

  - With second letter K:
      ""N K ? E R"": ""NKE"" -> ""NACKER"" too long? 
      ""N K E E R"" → ""NKEER"" not a word? 
      But also ""NUKER"" invalid? 

  Common words: 

  - ""NEVER"": N E V E R → duplicate E? 
  - ""NICER"": but I and C excluded → no.
  - ""NAKER"": not a word? and A excluded.

  Another word: ""N O B L E R""? Too long.

  How about ""N O P E R"" → ""NOPER"" not a word? 

  Another idea: ""N I G E R"" → I excluded.

  What about ""NYMPH"" not ending ER.

  We must have ER ending.

  Valid words: 

  - ""NEWER"": N E W E R → but duplicate E? 
  - ""NEVER"": yes, common word? 
  - ""NONER"": rarely used? 
  - ""NOXER""? no.

  I found ""NOBBY"" not ER.

  Perhaps ""JEWER"" not? 

  Another: ""H E W E R"" not starting with N.

  We need 5 letters: starting with N, ending with ER.

  Common words: 
    - ""NAKER"" → no. 
    - ""NARKY"" no? 

  ""NEVER"" is acceptable? Or ""BONER"" not.

  So let me try ""NEVER"": 
    Positions: 1: N, 2: E, 3: V, 4: E, 5: R.

  Constraints for E: we know E can be at 1,2,4? From previous? From Guess 1: E not position 5? Guess 2: E not position 3? But now E at position 2? That's a new position? So allowed? 

  But we have E at position 2 and position 4? We previously had only one E confirmed? 

  We can guess ""NEVER"" and see? 

  But we have to form it.

  Alternatively, ""NIXER"" has I→ excluded.

  ""NUDER""→ D excluded.

  ""NOYER""→ not common.

  ""NOKER""→ not common.

  ""N WER""? Not.

  So ""NEVER"" seems the most common? 

  But let me confirm: ""NEWER"" is another option? Also common? 

  But ""NEWER"" has two E's? 

  So possible words: ""NEVER"", ""NEWER"", ""NO?ER"" (if any), but minimal choice.

  To be safe, let's choose ""NEVER"".

  Why? Because even if there are two E's, it was not ruled out? 

  Also, V is a new letter? We haven't tested V.

  In guess 4 we tested U (absent), D (absent), so we try V now.

  If V is in the word, we get feedback? 

  So guess ""NEVER"". 

  Alternatively, we could try a word like ""N W E R"" but with two letters? 

  Since the word is ""N _ _ E R"", and we are at guess 5? We have only two positions unknown? 

  Perhaps optimize by using more common letters? 

  For example, we can try a word with common unused letters? Like O, L, etc.

  But in ""NEVER"", we use E again at position 2? But that is also a test for duplicate E.

  But we have nothing else? 

  Given the time, I choose ""NEVER"".

  So the guess is ""NEVER""

  Feedback will reveal if E is duplicated? 

  If the word is ""NEVER"", we get: 
    Position1: N (if at 1, should be ✓)
    Position2: E? Could be ✓, - or x? 
        If the secret word has E only at 4, then E at 2 would be x? 
        But we suspect some words have E at 2? 
    Position3: V? 
    Positions4 and 5: E and R: ✓

  Or if the word is ""NEWER"", same thing.

  But let's not give up: another word? ""NOTER""? N O T E R? But T is excluded → from guess 2, T is absent? 

  So T cannot be used.

  Therefore, no ""NOTER"". 

  ""LOSER"" → doesn't start with N.

  The only common one left is ""NEVER"".

  So I'll guess ""NEVER"". 

  But note: we have 6 guesses? And this is guess 5? We have one more if wrong.

  But we might be able to do better.

  Wait: ""NEVER"" has E at position 2? That position was not tested before? 

  Perhaps try ""NOVER"" or ""NOBER"" → not words? 

  What about ""N I G H T"" → not ER.

  After research, ""NEVER"" is a valid option? 

  Another: ""NE PER"" → not.

  So reluctantly, ""NEVER"". 

  Or ""NEWER""? Both are valid.

  But ""NEWER"" uses W? 

  They are similar.

  But here is the problem: we don't know how many E's? 

  Since we are forced to, let me pick ""NEVER"" because it's more common.

  So guessed word: ""NEVER""

  But note: we haven't tested position 2? We have tried position 2 only with letters: in ""crane"" position 2 was R? Then ""miner"" had M (absent) at 2? ""under"" had N at 2 (which was misplaced)? 

  So position 2 has been tested with R (miner had not at 2? We didn't test specifically position 2? Not by letter but with those letters? 

  Actually, we know that whatever letter is at position 2, we haven't tested that possible letter being present or absent? 

  So guessing is inevitable? 

  Therefore, I'll proceed.

  But logically, what are the possible words? The only common word with structure N _ _ E R and no excluded letters is ""NEVER"" or ""NEWER""? 

  Yes.

  So this is the guess.

<guess>never</guess>Based on all previous feedback:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Fixed Positions**:
   - Positions 4 (E) and 5 (R) are confirmed correct (✓ from Guess 3 and 4).

2. **N must be at Position 1**:
   - N is present but rules out:
     - Position 2 (Guess 4: `under` → N(-)).
     - Position 3 (Guess 3: `miner` → N(-)).
     - Position 4 (Guess 1: `crane` → N(-)).
     - Position 5 (Guess 2: `stern` → N(-)).
   - Only position 1 remains ⇒ **N must be at position 1**.

3. **Word Structure**:
   - Secret word is **N _ _ E R**.
   - Position 3 is not N (no duplicates indicated).
   - Positions 2 and 3 require distinct letters not excluded.

4. **Absent Letters**:
   - C, A, S, T (from early guesses).
   - M, I (Guess 3).
   - U, D (Guess 4).
   - Letters available: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

5. **Possible Words**:
   - Common candidates fitting `N _ _ E R` include **NEWER** (N,E,W,E,R) or **NEVER** (N,E,V,E,R), despite duplicated E (not explicitly ruled out).
   - Given exclusão lists, **NEVER** is selected as the most common valid word. It tests:
     - N at position 1 (✓ expected).
     - E at position 2 (new test; potential duplicate).
     - V at position 3 (new letter).
     - E/R at 4/5 (✓ confirmed).

These are common letters.\n\n So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":\n C: x (not in the secret word)\n R: - (in the word but wrong position)\n A: x (not in the secret word)\n N: - (in the word but wrong position)\n E: - (in the word but wrong position)\n\n So, we know:\n - The secret word contains the letters R, N, and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".\n   Specifically, R is not in position 2, N is not in position 4, and E is not in position 5.\n - The letters C and A are not in the secret word at all.\n\n We also know that the secret word is 5 letters long.\n\n We need to make a second guess that:\n   - Does not use C or A (since they are absent)\n   - Includes R, N, E (but in different positions than in ""crane"")\n   - We might also want to include other common letters to test.\n\n Since R, N, and E are in the word, we can try to place them in new positions.\n\n In ""crane"", the positions were:\n   C (1), R (2), A (3), N (4), E (5)\n\n So for the next guess, we must avoid:\n   - Putting R at position 2\n   - Putting N at position 4\n   - Putting E at position 5\n\n Also, we cannot use C or A.\n\n Let\'s think of words that have R, N, E and two other letters (which we don\'t know yet) and that place R, N, E in new positions.\n\n We can also consider that the word might have repeated letters? But typically in Wordle, words can have repeated letters, but it\'s less common. Since the feedback didn\'t indicate any duplicate, we assume no duplicates for now.\n\n We have three known letters: R, N, E. We need two more letters.\n\n We can try to use a word that has R, N, E and two new common consonants or vowels.\n\n Common consonants: T, S, L, etc.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word.\n\n Possibilities:\n\n We know R cannot be at position 2. So R can be at 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n Similarly, N cannot be at 4, so N can be at 1,2,3,5.\n E cannot be at 5, so E can be at 1,2,3,4.\n\n We also want to test new letters. Let\'s try to include \'T\' and \'S\' for example.\n\n Example words:\n\n - ""RENTS"": \n   R at position 1 (which is new for R, since previously R was at 2 -> now 1 is different)\n   E at position 2 (previously E was at 5 -> now 2 is different)\n   N at position 3 (previously N was at 4 -> now 3 is different)\n   T and S are new.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if T and S are in the word. This is a way to test.\n\n Alternatively, ""ROTED"" is not a word. We need valid words.\n\n Another idea: ""INERT"" -> but we cannot use A and C, but I is allowed? However, we don\'t know about I. But note: we have to avoid A and C, but other vowels are possible.\n\n However, we have to be cautious: the word must be valid.\n\n Let me think of words that have R, N, E and two other letters.\n\n Some options:\n\n - ""RENEW"" -> but E is repeated? We don\'t know if repetition is allowed. Also, E is at position 2 and 4? But we know E is in the word, but we don\'t know if it appears twice. However, the feedback for the first guess only showed one E as present, but if there were two, it would have shown two minuses? Actually, the feedback only marks each letter that is present. If a letter is repeated and one is in the correct position, it would show a check for that one and a minus for the other? But in our case, we only had one E and it was marked as minus. So the word might have one E or more? We don\'t know.\n\n But to keep it simple, let\'s avoid duplicates for now.\n\n Another word: ""ROBIN"" -> but we don\'t have E? We must include E because we know it\'s in the word. So we need R, N, and E.\n\n How about ""DRIVE""? But we don\'t have N? We must include N because we know it\'s in the word.\n\n We must include R, N, and E.\n\n Let me try: ""RINSE"" -> \n   R at 1 (new position, previously 2 -> so allowed)\n   I at 2 (new letter)\n   N at 3 (previously at 4, now 3 -> allowed)\n   S at 4 (new letter)\n   E at 5 -> but wait, in the first guess E was at 5 and we got a minus meaning E is in the word but not at 5. So we cannot put E at 5 again? Actually, we can, but if we put E at 5 and the secret word has E at 5, then we would get a check. But the feedback said E is not at 5, so if we put E at 5 again, we know it will be wrong? Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at 5 again, it will still be wrong. So we should avoid putting E at 5.\n\n Therefore, in ""RINSE"", E is at 5 -> which is the same position as before. We know that position is wrong, so we should avoid that.\n\n We need a word that has E not at 5.\n\n How about ""RENEW""? But that has two E\'s. And the second E is at 5? So we have E at 2 and 5. We know E is not at 5, so the E at 5 would be wrong, but the E at 2 might be correct? But we don\'t know. Also, we are using two E\'s.\n\n Alternatively, ""URINE"" -> \n   U at 1 (new)\n   R at 2 -> but wait, in the first guess R was at 2 and we got a minus meaning R is not at 2. So we cannot put R at 2 again? Actually, we can, but we know it\'s not at 2 so it will be minus again. We want to try R in a new position.\n\n So we should avoid putting R at 2, N at 4, and E at 5.\n\n Let me try to find a word that has:\n   R at 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2)\n   N at 1,2,3,5 (but not 4)\n   E at 1,2,3,4 (but not 5)\n\n And the word must be 5 letters and not contain C or A.\n\n Example: ""RODEO"" -> no N and E? Not good.\n\n Another: ""HORDE"" -> \n   H at 1\n   O at 2\n   R at 3 -> allowed (since R was at 2, now 3 is new)\n   D at 4\n   E at 5 -> not allowed (because E cannot be at 5)\n\n So we avoid E at 5.\n\n How about ""HORNE""? Not a word.\n\n ""RENAL"" -> but A is not allowed? We know A is not in the word, so we cannot use A.\n\n ""RENAL"" has A -> invalid.\n\n ""REIGN"" -> \n   R at 1 -> allowed (not position 2)\n   E at 2 -> allowed (not position 5)\n   I at 3\n   G at 4\n   N at 5 -> allowed (not position 4)\n\n This seems good: \n   Positions: R(1), E(2), I(3), G(4), N(5)\n\n We are testing R at 1, E at 2, and N at 5. Also, we are introducing I and G.\n\n So let\'s go with ""REIGN"".\n\n But note: we are not using the fact that in the first word, we had R at 2 and now we are putting R at 1. Similarly, E was at 5 and now at 2, and N was at 4 and now at 5.\n\n This is a valid guess.\n\n Alternatively, we could try ""ROUTE"" -> but E at 5 is not allowed.\n\n Another option: ""SERIF"" -> \n   S at 1\n   E at 2 -> allowed\n   R at 3 -> allowed (not 2)\n   I at 4\n   F at 5\n\n But we are missing N? We must include N because we know it\'s in the word. So we cannot leave out N.\n\n Therefore, we must have R, N, and E in the guess.\n\n So ""REIGN"" is a valid word that includes R, N, E and avoids the forbidden positions.\n\n Let me check if ""REIGN"" is a valid English word: yes, it means to rule.\n\n So I will guess ""REIGN"".\n\n However, note that we are also trying to test new letters. We are testing I and G, which we haven\'t tried before.\n\n We might also consider ""NERDY"" -> \n   N at 1 -> allowed (not 4)\n   E at 2 -> allowed (not 5)\n   R at 3 -> allowed (not 2)\n   D at 4\n   Y at 5\n\n But we don\'t know about D and Y. And ""NERDY"" is a word.\n\n But we have to choose one. Let me compare:\n\n ""REIGN"" and ""NERDY""\n\n Both are valid. But ""REIGN"" uses G and I, while ""NERDY"" uses D and Y.\n\n We might want to use more common letters. G is more common than Y? And D is common.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""ENTER"" -> \n   E at 1 -> allowed (not 5)\n   N at 2 -> allowed (not 4)\n   T at 3\n   E at 4 -> but wait, we are repeating E? We don\'t know if the word has two E\'s. Also, we are putting E at 1 and 4. The feedback for the first guess only showed one E, but that doesn\'t mean there isn\'t two. However, we are using two E\'s and we only know one is present. This might be inefficient.\n\n So I think ""REIGN"" is a good choice.\n\n Let me see if there\'s a word that uses more common letters. For example, including T or S.\n\n How about ""RENTS"": \n   R at 1 -> allowed\n   E at 2 -> allowed\n   N at 3 -> allowed (previously at 4, now 3 is new)\n   T at 4 -> but wait, N was at 4 in the first guess and we got a minus meaning N is not at 4. But now we are putting T at 4? That\'s fine. And S at 5.\n\n But E is at 2 and we are not repeating. Also, we are including T and S, which are common.\n\n However, we have to avoid putting E at 5? We are not. But note: we are putting N at 3 and E at 2, which are new positions.\n\n But what about the letter S? We don\'t know if it\'s in the word.\n\n Also, in ""RENTS"", we have R, E, N, T, S. That\'s five distinct letters? Yes.\n\n And the positions: \n   R:1 (new), E:2 (new), N:3 (new), T:4, S:5.\n\n We are testing T and S, which are common.\n\n But note: we are not using the fact that we know E is in the word? We are using E, so that\'s good.\n\n However, we are putting E at 2. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing.\n\n Also, we are putting N at 3, which is a new position.\n\n But wait: in the first guess, we had R at 2 and now we are putting R at 1. That\'s good.\n\n So ""RENTS"" is also a good candidate.\n\n Which one to choose? \n\n We want to maximize information. ""RENTS"" uses T and S, which are very common. ""REIGN"" uses I and G, which are less common.\n\n So ""RENTS"" might be better.\n\n But note: we are putting E at 2 and we don\'t know if that\'s correct. Also, we are putting N at 3 and T at 4 and S at 5.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""STERN"": \n   S at 1\n   T at 2\n   E at 3 -> allowed (not 5)\n   R at 4 -> allowed (not 2)\n   N at 5 -> allowed (not 4)\n\n This also includes R, N, E and uses S and T.\n\n And the positions are all new for R, N, E.\n\n So ""STERN"" is another option.\n\n Let me compare:\n\n ""RENTS"": R1, E2, N3, T4, S5\n ""STERN"": S1, T2, E3, R4, N5\n\n Both are valid.\n\n But note: in ""STERN"", we are putting R at 4 and N at 5. We haven\'t tried these positions.\n\n Also, we are testing S and T in both.\n\n I think ""STERN"" might be slightly better because it places R and N in positions we haven\'t tested at all (4 and 5) and E in 3.\n\n But we are also testing S at 1 and T at 2.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose ""ROUSE"" -> but E at 5 is not allowed.\n\n After consideration, I think ""STERN"" is a good choice.\n\n However, we must avoid using A and C, and both ""RENTS"" and ""STERN"" are safe.\n\n I\'ll go with ""STERN"" because it uses common letters and tests new positions.\n\n But note: we have to make sure we don\'t use any forbidden letters. We know the secret word does not contain C or A. ""STERN"" has S, T, E, R, N -> no C or A. Good.\n\n So let\'s choose ""STERN"".\n\n Alternatively, we can choose ""RENEW"" but that has two E\'s and we don\'t know if that\'s necessary. Also, E at 5 is not allowed? Actually, ""RENEW"" has E at 2 and 5. We know E is not at 5, so the E at 5 would be a waste? But if the word has two E\'s, then we might get a minus for the E at 5. But we don\'t know. So it\'s better to avoid duplicates for now.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""STERN"".\n\n But wait, in the first guess, we had R at 2 and we got a minus. Now in ""STERN"", we are putting R at 4. Similarly, E was at 5 and now at 3, and N was at 4 and now at 5. So we are testing new positions.\n\n So the second guess: ""STERN""\n\n Let me write it: S T E R N\n\n But note: the word is ""stern"".\n\n We\'ll see the feedback.\n\n However, note: the feedback for the first guess had R, N, and E as present. So we are including them.\n\n So I\'ll go with ""STERN"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C and A are absent (x), so they can be excluded from future guesses.\n- R, N, and E are present (-) but in incorrect positions. Specifically:\n  - R cannot be in position 2.\n  - N cannot be in position 4.\n  - E cannot be in position 5.\n\nFor the second guess, I need a 5-letter word that:\n1. Includes R, N, and E (since they are confirmed present).\n2. Avoids C and A (confirmed absent).\n3. Places R, N, and E in new positions (not 2, 4, and 5 respectively).\n4. Tests new common letters (like S and T) for maximum information.\n\nThe word ""stern"" fits all criteria:\n- Contains R (position 4), N (position 5), and E (position 3) — all in new positions.\n- Uses S and T (common letters not yet tested).\n- Avoids C and A.\n- Is a valid English word.\n\nThis guess will help narrow down the positions of R, N, E and test S and T efficiently.\n\n<guess>stern</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: stern -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) E(-) R(-) N(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n  C: x (not in the word)\n  R: - (in word, wrong position)\n  A: x (not in word)\n  N: - (in word, wrong position)\n  E: - (in word, wrong position)\n\nFrom this, we know:\n- The secret word contains R, N, E (each at least once).\n- It does not contain C or A.\n- R is not at position 2.\n- N is not at position 4.\n- E is not at position 5.\n\nGuess 2: ""stern""\n  S: x (not in word)\n  T: x (not in word)\n  E: - (in word, wrong position)\n  R: - (in word, wrong position)\n  N: - (in word, wrong position)\n\nFrom this, we know:\n- The secret word does not contain S or T.\n- E is in the word but not at position 3 (since ""stern"" has E at position 3 and it got a minus).\n- R is in the word but not at position 4 (since ""stern"" has R at position 4 and it got a minus).\n- N is in the word but not at position 5 (since ""stern"" has N at position 5 and it got a minus).\n\nWe also know that E is not at position 5 (from guess1) and not at position 3 (from guess2). Similarly, R is not at position 2 (guess1) and not at position 4 (guess2). N is not at position 4 (guess1) and not at position 5 (guess2).\n\nSo summary:\n\nLetters in the word: R, N, E (definitely at least once each)\nLetters not in the word: C, A, S, T\n\nWe need to include R, N, E and two new letters.\n\nPosition constraints:\n\nFor R:\nCannot be at: 2 (from ""crane"") and 4 (from ""stern"")\nSo possible positions: 1, 3, 5\n\nFor N:\nCannot be at: 4 (from ""crane"") and 5 (from ""stern"")\nSo possible positions: 1, 2, 3\n\nFor E:\nCannot be at: 5 (from ""crane"") and 3 (from ""stern"")\nSo possible positions: 1, 2, 4\n\nWe have used up two guesses and have four left.\n\nWe need to choose a word that:\n- Contains R, N, E\n- Does not contain C, A, S, T\n- Places R, N, E in positions that are still possible according to the constraints.\n\nAlso, we must introduce two new letters to test.\n\nWe have already tested: C, R, A, N, E, S, T (7 letters). So the remaining letters are many, but we need common ones.\n\nWe can use letters like: L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.\n\nWe need a 5-letter word with R, N, E and two others.\n\nWe need to form a valid word.\n\nWe also have to consider the positions: R must be at 1,3,5; N at 1,2,3; E at 1,2,4.\n\nWe can try to fix the positions and look for words.\n\nFor example, let R be at position 3 (one of the options). Then what?\n\nPossible word structures.\n\nLet me think of words containing R, N, E.\n\nSince E has only three possible positions (1,2,4), and R has three (1,3,5), and N has three (1,2,3), we need overlap.\n\nWe cannot have repeated letters? We don\'t know, but in the feedback so far, there has been no indication of duplicates. So we assume no duplicates for now.\n\nSo let E be at position 4. Then we have positions 1,2,3,5 to place R and N (and two other letters).\n\nBut E at 4: then positions:\n1: ?\n2: ?\n3: ?\n5: ?\n\nN must be at 1,2,3 (since it cannot be at 4 or 5). Similarly, R must be at 1,3,5.\n\nIf E is at 4, then position 4 is taken by E.\n\nThen for N: can be at 1,2,3.\n\nFor R: can be at 1,3,5.\n\nBut if R is at 3, and E at 4, then the word might be ? ? R E ?\n\nBut N must be in one of 1,2,3.\n\nFor example, if N at 1: then word: N ? R E ?\n\nIf N at 2: word: ? N R E ?\n\nIf N at 3: but R might also be at 3? But we assume distinct, so they can\'t both be at 3. So if E is at 4, position 3 must be either R or N? But we have to assign.\n\nActually, position 3 can be R or one of the new letters, and similarly.\n\nBut let\'s look for actual words.\n\nTry E at position 4.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ENDER: but has E at 2? And E at 5? We have E at 4, but also E at 2 and 5? That\'s multiple E\'s? But let\'s see structure.\n\nWe need E only once? We don\'t know.\n\nBut try: words like ""RENEW"" has E at 2 and 5 -> not good because E cannot be at 5.\n\nOther words: How about ""LINER""? But we don\'t know if L and I are in the word.\n\n""LINER"": \nPosition 1: L\nPosition 2: I\nPosition 3: N\nPosition 4: E\nPosition 5: R\n\nCheck constraints:\nR: at 5 -> allowed (since R can be at 1,3,5)\nN: at 3 -> allowed (N can be at 1,2,3)\nE: at 4 -> allowed (E can be at 1,2,4)\n\nAlso, L and I are new letters (not tested yet).\n\nAlso, no C,A,S,T -> good.\n\nIs ""LINER"" a word? Yes, meaning an ocean liner or a person who lines.\n\nSo this is a valid guess.\n\nBut note: we have N at position 3 and E at 4. In ""crane"", N was at 4 (which is not allowed, but now N at 3) and E was at 5 (not allowed, but now E at 4).\n\nAlso, R was at 2 in ""crane"" (not allowed) and now R at 5.\n\nSo this word satisfies all position constraints.\n\nWe can have other options.\n\nFor example, with E at position 4, R at 5, and N at 1: then word structure: N ? ? E R\n\nWhat words fit? e.g., ""NUDER""? Not a word. ""NEWER"" has two E\'s? E at 4, but E at 2? And E at 4? And E cannot be at 5? But ""NEWER"" has E at 2 and 5? Not good.\n\nWith E at position 4, R at 5, and N at 2: word: ? N ? E R -> e.g., ""INNER"" has two N\'s? Not good. Or ""MINER"": M at 1, I at 2? Then N at 3? But we need N at 2? ""MINER"" is M I N E R -> positions: N at 3, E at 4, R at 5. So N at 3 (allowed), E at 4 (allowed), R at 5 (allowed). Then the second letter is I? So word: M I N E R.\n\n""M"" and ""I"" are new letters.\n\n""MINER"" is a word.\n\nSimilarly, we could have ""LINER"" as above.\n\nAnother option: E at position 4, R at 3, and N somewhere? But R at 3: so positions 1,2 have letters? Then E at 4, then 5.\n\nN can be at 1 or 2.\n\nIf N at 1: word: N ? R E ? -> e.g., ""NARES"" but has A -> invalid. ""NORES"" but O? And we don\'t have A, but O? Also, ""NORES"" is not common? Actually, ""N"" something ""R"" ""E"" S -> but S is invalid? We know S is not in the word.\n\nWe cannot use S.\n\nSo perhaps not.\n\nWith E at other positions.\n\nFor example, E at position 1: allowed? E can be at 1,2,4.\n\nThen if E at 1, then word must be E ? ? ? ?\n\nThen R must be at 3 or 5? Or at 1? But 1 is E, so R cannot be at 1. So R at 3 or 5.\n\nN must be at 1? But 1 is E, so cannot have N at 1? So N must be at 2 or 3.\n\nBut position 1 is E.\n\nSo E at 1.\n\nPossible: word E _ _ _ _\n\nFor N: can be position 2 or 3.\n\nFor R: can be position 3 or 5.\n\nIf N at 2: and R at 3: then E at 1, N at 2, R at 3 -> then positions 4 and 5 are new letters.\n\nWord: E N R ? ? \n\nWhat words? ""ENROL"" but has O and L? But O is allowed? But the word has E at 1, N at 2, R at 3, O at 4, L at 5.\n\nBut N at 2: allowed? Yes.\n\nR at 3: allowed? Yes (R cannot be at 2 or 4, but 3 is okay).\n\nBut we have O and L.\n\nIs this a word? ""ENROL"" -> yes.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if O and L are in the word.\n\nSimilarly, we could have other words.\n\nBut let\'s compare with ""MINER"" or ""LINER"".\n\nAnother structure: E at position 2.\n\nThen word: ? E ? ? ?\n\nE at position 2: allowed.\n\nThen R possible positions: 1,3,5 (since cannot be 2 or 4? Wait, R cannot be at 2, but E is at 2? So no problem. R can be at 1,3,5)\n\nN possible positions: 1,2,3? But 2 is E, so N can only be at 1 or 3.\n\nSo if E at 2:\n\nThen N at 1 or 3.\n\nR at 1,3,5? But if N at 1, then R can be at 3 or 5? Not at 1.\n\nIf N at 1: then R at 3 or 5.\n\nThen word: N E ? ? R  or N E ? R ?  (if R at 3 or 5)\n\nFor example: N E R ? ? -> but R at 3? And E at 2.\n\nWord: ""NERDY"" but we know D and Y? But also, we know S and T are invalid? S and T are out, but D and Y we don\'t know.\n\n""Nerdy"" has positions: N1, E2, R3, D4, Y5.\n\nConstraints: N at 1: allowed (N positions:1,2,3)\nE at 2: allowed? Yes (since E must not be at 3 or 5? E cannot be at 3? From ""stern"", E at 3 got minus? And cannot be at 5 from ""crane"". But position 2 is new? Yes, so allowed.\n\nBut note: E was at 5 in ""crane"" and not at 3 in ""stern"", so position 2 is indeed available.\n\nSimilarly, R at 3: allowed? R cannot be at 2 or 4? 3 is allowed? Yes.\n\nSo ""NERDY"" is possible: letters N, E, R, D, Y -> no C,A,S,T -> valid.\n\nBut is Y a common letter? Not very, but possible.\n\nAlternatively, N E and then position 3 and 4,5.\n\nExamples: N E S S T -> but S and T are invalid.\n\nNot possible.\n\nAnother: N E W E R -> two E\'s? and E not at 5? But position 5 is R? Actually, ""newer"" has E at 2 and 5? But E cannot be at 5? So if we guess ""NEWER"", E at 5 would be wrong.\n\nBut we have E at position 5 again? We should avoid since we know E is not at 5.\n\nTherefore, ""NERDY"" or ""MINER"" or ""LINER"" or ""ENROL"".\n\nWe need to pick one.\n\nAlso, we must maximize information. So we want to test common unused letters.\n\nUnused letters so far: all except C,A,S,T,R,N,E (and the ones used in guesses, but only c,a,n,e,r,s,t).\n\nSo guess1: c,r,a,n,e -> letters tested: C,R,A,N,E\nguess2: s,t,e,r,n -> letters tested: S,T,E,R,N\n\nSo tested: A, C, E, N, R, S, T.\n\nSo unused: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe want common letters: e.g., L, I, O, D, U, M, P, etc.\n\nWe can calculate frequency, but roughly.\n\nFor now, I think ""LINER"" is a good choice because it uses L and I, which are common vowels and consonants.\n\nSimilarly, ""MINER"" uses M and I.\n\n""NERDY"" uses D and Y.\n\n""ENROL"" uses O and L.\n\n""LINER"" uses L and I.\n\nWe can choose ""LINER"" or ""MINER"".\n\nLet me pick ""MINER"" because M is a common consonant.\n\n""MINER"" structure:\nPosition 1: M\nPosition 2: I\nPosition 3: N\nPosition 4: E\nPosition 5: R\n\nConstraints:\nE at 4: allowed (E possible positions 1,2,4)\nN at 3: allowed (N possible positions 1,2,3)\nR at 5: allowed (R possible positions 1,3,5)\n\nAnd M and I are new.\n\nWe haven\'t tested M or I.\n\nThus, a good guess.\n\nWe could also do ""LINER"" with L at 1 and I at 2.\n\nBut both are valid.\n\nI think ""MINER"" is slightly better? Or not sure.\n\nAnother word: ""DINER"" -> \nPosition 1: D\nPosition 2: I\nPosition 3: N\nPosition 4: E\nPosition 5: R? \n\nBut E at 4: allowed? Yes.\nN at 3: allowed? Yes.\nR at 5: allowed? Yes.\n\nAnd D and I are new.\n\nAlso valid.\n\nBut ""miner"" is more common? \n\nSince we have to choose, I\'ll go with ""miner"".\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if M is in the word. We are testing it.\n\nIf M is absent, we get an \'x\' for M, which is useful.\n\nSimilarly, for I.\n\nSo I think ""MINER"" is a reasonable guess.\n\nAfter research, I found that ""miner"" is an appropriate word to use.\n\nSo the third guess: ""MINER""\n\nIn the response format, we output the guess.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **Guess 1 (crane)**: R, N, and E are present but in incorrect positions (R not in position 2, N not in position 4, E not in position 5). C and A are absent.\n- **Guess 2 (stern)**: E, R, and N are present but in incorrect positions (E not in position 3, R not in position 4, N not in position 5). S and T are absent.\n\nKey deductions:\n- The secret word contains R, N, and E (each at least once), and excludes C, A, S, T.\n- Position constraints:\n  - R can only be in positions 1, 3, or 5 (not 2 or 4).\n  - N can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (not 4 or 5).\n  - E can only be in positions 1, 2, or 4 (not 3 or 5).\n- The word must be 5 letters, using only untested letters besides R, N, E (e.g., avoiding C, A, S, T).\n\nFor this guess, ""MINER"" is selected because:\n- It includes R, N, E (required).\n- It avoids forbidden letters (C, A, S, T).\n- It places R, N, E in valid positions based on constraints:\n  - R at position 5 (allowed).\n  - N at position 3 (allowed).\n  - E at position 4 (allowed).\n- It introduces two new common letters (M and I) for testing.\n\n<guess>miner</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: stern -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) E(-) R(-) N(-)\nGuess 3: miner -> FEEDBACK: M(x) I(x) N(-) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from the third guess ""miner"":\n M: x (not in the word)\n I: x (not in the word)\n N: - (in the word but wrong position)\n E: ✓ (correct position)\n R: ✓ (correct position)\n\n So, from ""miner"":\n - E is in the word and in the correct position: position 4.\n - R is in the word and in the correct position: position 5.\n - N is in the word but not in position 3 (since we got a minus for N at position 3).\n - M and I are not in the word.\n\n Also, from previous guesses, we know:\n - The secret word contains R, N, E (which we already knew) and now we know E is at position 4 and R is at position 5.\n - We also know that N is not at position 3 (from this guess) and not at position 4 (from guess1) and not at position 5 (from guess2). But position 5 is R, so that\'s consistent. Also, from guess1, N was not at 4, and now we know E is at 4, so that\'s good.\n\n Now, the secret word has:\n   Position 4: E\n   Position 5: R\n\n And N is in the word but not at position 3, and not at 4 or 5 (which are taken). So N must be at position 1 or 2.\n\n Also, we know from guess1 that R was not at position 2 (which we already knew, and now R is at 5, so that\'s fine) and from guess2 that R was not at 4 (and now we have R at 5, so also fine).\n\n We also know that E is at 4, so it cannot be at 1 or 2 (but we already knew E was not at 5, and now we know it\'s at 4).\n\n Now, the word structure is: _ _ _ E R\n\n We know N is at either position 1 or 2.\n\n We also have two more letters to fill: the first and second positions (if N is at 1, then position 2 is another letter; if N is at 2, then position 1 is another letter). And position 3 is still unknown, but we know it\'s not N (because in ""miner"" we had N at 3 and it was wrong) and not E or R (since they are at 4 and 5).\n\n Also, we know the word does not contain: C, A, S, T, M, I.\n\n We need to find a word that fits: _ _ _ E R, with N in position 1 or 2, and the other two positions (the remaining one and position 3) are filled with letters that are not C, A, S, T, M, I.\n\n We also know that the word must contain N (which we are placing at 1 or 2) and the other two letters.\n\n Let\'s consider the possibilities:\n\n Case 1: N at position 1\n   Word: N _ _ E R\n   Then position 2 and 3 are two other letters.\n\n Case 2: N at position 2\n   Word: _ N _ E R\n   Then position 1 and 3 are two other letters.\n\n We need to find valid English words that fit one of these patterns and use only letters not excluded.\n\n Excluded letters: A, C, I, M, S, T.\n\n We can use: B, D, E (but E is already placed), F, G, H, J, K, L, N (but we are using it), O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n But note: we have to use two more distinct letters? We don\'t know if there are duplicates, but so far no duplicates have been indicated.\n\n We can try to list possible words.\n\n First, case 1: N at 1 -> N _ _ E R\n\n Possible words:\n   N U D E R -> ""NUDER"" (not a word)\n   N A G E R -> but A is excluded -> invalid\n   N O G E R -> ""NOGER"" (not a word)\n   N U K E R -> ""NUKER"" (a word, meaning one that nukes)\n   N I K E R -> but I is excluded -> invalid\n   N O K E R -> ""NOKER"" (not a word)\n   N O V E R -> ""NOVER"" (not a word)\n   N E V E R -> but E at position 2? And we have E at 4. But ""NEVER"" has two E\'s? And E at position 2: but we don\'t know if E is duplicated? However, in the first guess, we had E and it was marked as present (but not at 5) and now we have E at 4. If there is another E, it might be possible. But in ""NEVER"", we have E at 2 and 4. So if we guess ""NEVER"", then:\n        Position 1: N -> but we are considering N at 1, which is allowed? But we know N is not at 3, but we don\'t know about position 1. However, in this case, we are putting N at 1 and E at 2 and 4, and R at 5.\n\n        But we have to check the feedback: \n          In ""miner"", we had E at 4 correct, so if there is an E at 2, that would be a new E? But the feedback for ""miner"" didn\'t show an extra E? Actually, in ""miner"", we had only one E (at position 4) and it was correct. The feedback for E was a check, meaning that E is at 4. The other letters: M, I, N, R. The N was present but wrong position, and R was correct. There was no indication of a second E? But if the word had two E\'s, then in ""miner"" we only tested one E (at 4) and it was correct, so the other E (if at 2) would not have been tested. So it\'s possible.\n\n        However, we are not sure. But let\'s see if ""NEVER"" is a valid word? Yes.\n\n        But we have to check the constraints for N: in ""NEVER"", N is at 1 -> allowed (since N can be at 1 or 2). \n        Also, E at 2: but we know E can be at 1,2,4? And we have E at 4 already. But the feedback from guess1 and guess2 didn\'t rule out E at 2? \n          - In guess1, E was at 5 and got minus -> so E is not at 5, but 2 is different.\n          - In guess2, E was at 3 and got minus -> so E is not at 3, but 2 is different.\n          So E at 2 is allowed.\n\n        However, we have two E\'s? The secret word might have two E\'s? We don\'t know.\n\n        But note: in the first guess ""crane"", we had one E and it was marked as present (minus) meaning there is at least one E. Now we have E at 4 (correct) and if we put E at 2, that would be a second E? But we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s.\n\n        We can try ""NEVER"", but we are not forced to. We can avoid duplicates if possible.\n\n        But let\'s see other words.\n\n   Other words: ""NAKER"" -> not a word, and A is excluded.\n   ""NAB E R"" -> A excluded.\n\n   How about ""NUDER""? Not a word.\n\n   ""NUKER"": N at 1, U at 2, K at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> valid word? Yes, meaning one that nukes.\n\n   And U and K are not excluded.\n\n   So ""NUKER"" is a possibility.\n\n   Also, ""NONER"" -> not a word.\n\n   ""NOYER"" -> not a word.\n\n   ""NOHOW"" -> not ending with ER.\n\n   So ""NUKER"" is one.\n\n Case 2: N at position 2 -> _ N _ E R\n\n Possible words:\n   B N E E R -> ""BNEER"" not a word.\n   D N E E R -> ""DNEER"" not a word.\n   F N E E R -> not a word.\n   G N E E R -> ""GNEER"" not a word.\n   H N E E R -> not a word.\n   J N E E R -> not a word.\n   K N E E R -> not a word.\n   L N E E R -> not a word.\n   O N E E R -> ""ONEER"" not a word.\n   P N E E R -> not a word.\n   Q N E E R -> not a word.\n   U N E E R -> not a word.\n   V N E E R -> not a word.\n   W N E E R -> not a word.\n   X N E E R -> not a word.\n   Y N E E R -> not a word.\n   Z N E E R -> not a word.\n\n   What about ""ONCER""? But C is excluded.\n\n   How about ""UNDER""? \n        U at 1, N at 2, D at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> ""UNDER""\n        This is a valid word.\n\n        Constraints: \n          N at 2: allowed (N can be at 1,2,3 -> 2 is allowed)\n          E at 4: correct (we know)\n          R at 5: correct (we know)\n          U and D are new letters.\n\n        And no excluded letters.\n\n        So ""UNDER"" is a valid word.\n\n   Also, ""UNGER"": U at 1, N at 2, G at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> ""UNGER"" is a surname? But it\'s a valid word? Actually, it might be accepted as a proper noun, but in Wordle, common words are used. ""UNGER"" is not common. \n\n   ""UNPER""? Not a word.\n\n   ""UNMET""? But ends with T? T is excluded.\n\n   ""UNZIP""? But Z and P, but ends with P? We need ER at the end.\n\n   So ""UNDER"" is a common word.\n\n   Also, ""OWNER"": O at 1, W at 2, N at 3? But we need N at 2? ""OWNER"" has N at 3? So not.\n\n   ""INNER"": I is excluded and N at 2? ""INNER"" has I at 1, N at 2, N at 3? Duplicate N? And I is excluded.\n\n   ""HONER"": H at 1, O at 2, N at 3? But we need N at 2? So not.\n\n   So the main candidates are:\n        Case 1: ""NUKER"" (N at 1)\n        Case 2: ""UNDER"" (N at 2)\n\n We have two possibilities.\n\n We need to choose one.\n\n We can also consider if there are other words.\n\n Another word for case 1: ""NAZER""? Not a word.\n\n For case 2: ""UNGER"" might be accepted? But ""UNDER"" is better.\n\n Also, ""ONERY"" -> but not ending with ER.\n\n So between ""NUKER"" and ""UNDER"", which one to choose?\n\n We know that in the word, we have E at 4 and R at 5, and N at either 1 or 2.\n\n We also know that in the first guess, we had N at 4 (which is now E) and it was present but wrong position. In the second guess, N at 5 (which is now R) and it was present but wrong position. In the third guess, N at 3 and it was present but wrong position.\n\n So N has been tried at positions 3,4,5 and all were wrong. So it must be at 1 or 2.\n\n Now, we can choose a word that tests one of these.\n\n But note: we have only two possibilities? Actually, no, because the other letters matter.\n\n However, we can choose a word that will help us distinguish.\n\n But we have two candidates: ""NUKER"" and ""UNDER"". They are both possible.\n\n We can also think of other words? For example, ""FJORD"" but doesn\'t end with ER.\n\n We must end with ER.\n\n Another word: ""OUNCE"" but not ending with ER.\n\n So let\'s list all possible words:\n\n For pattern _ _ _ E R:\n\n With N at 1: \n   N _ _ E R -> we have ""NUKER"" (and maybe others? ""NAKER"" not a word, ""NIXER"" has I, ""NOYER"" not, ""NUBER"" not, ""NUDER"" not, ""NUMER"" not, ""NURSE"" has S -> invalid, ""NUTTY"" not, etc.) So only ""NUKER"" seems common.\n\n With N at 2:\n   _ N _ E R -> we have ""UNDER"", and also ""ANGER"" but A excluded, ""INKER"" I excluded, ""ONCER"" C excluded, ""OWNER"" has N at 3? No, ""OWNER"" is O W N E R -> N at 3, not 2. \n   ""HONEY"" not ending with ER.\n\n   ""JNANA"" not.\n\n   So only ""UNDER"" is common.\n\n   Also, ""UNLED"" not ending with ER.\n\n   ""UNMET"" has T.\n\n   So ""UNDER"" is the main candidate for N at 2.\n\n   Another: ""UNWED"" not.\n\n   ""UNZIP"" not.\n\n   So we have two candidates: ""NUKER"" and ""UNDER"".\n\n We can choose one to guess. Since we have two possibilities, we can pick one arbitrarily, but we have to make a guess.\n\n Alternatively, we can think of a word that tests both possibilities? But we have to fill the entire word.\n\n We can guess ""NUKER"" and if it\'s not, then ""UNDER"" must be the word.\n\n But we have to use one guess.\n\n Let\'s see the frequency: ""UNDER"" is more common than ""NUKER"". So perhaps ""UNDER"" is more likely.\n\n But we don\'t know.\n\n We can also consider that in ""miner"", we had N at 3 and it was present but wrong. If the word were ""NUKER"", then N is at 1, which is a new position. Similarly, for ""UNDER"", N is at 2.\n\n We have no information about position 1 or 2 for N.\n\n So we can choose ""UNDER"" because it\'s a more common word.\n\n But note: we have to avoid excluded letters. Both are safe.\n\n I\'ll go with ""UNDER"".\n\n But wait: in ""UNDER"", we have U at 1 and D at 3. We haven\'t tested U or D.\n\n Similarly, in ""NUKER"", we have U at 2 and K at 3.\n\n We are testing new letters in both.\n\n But ""UNDER"" is a very common word.\n\n So the fourth guess: ""UNDER""\n\n If it\'s not, then we try ""NUKER"" next.\n\n But we have two guesses left? We are at guess 4, and we have 6 tries.\n\n So we can do that.\n\n Alternatively, we could try a word that tests the presence of U? But we are forced to use one of these patterns.\n\n I think ""UNDER"" is a good guess.\n\n So let\'s go with ""UNDER"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (crane)**: R, N, E are present (but misplaced); C and A are absent.\n- **Guess 2 (stern)**: E, R, N are present (but misplaced); S and T are absent.\n- **Guess 3 (miner)**: \n  - E (position 4) and R (position 5) are correct (✓).\n  - N is present but misplaced (-), so it cannot be in position 3.\n  - M and I are absent (x).\n\n### Key Deductions:\n1. **Fixed positions**: \n   - Position 4 must be **E**.\n   - Position 5 must be **R**.\n   - The word ends with **ER**.\n2. **N constraints**: \n   - N is in the word but cannot be in positions 3, 4 (from Guess 1), or 5 (from Guess 2). Thus, N must be in position **1 or 2**.\n3. **Absent letters**: C, A, S, T, M, I (cannot appear in the word).\n4. **Word structure**: `_ _ _ E R` (with N in position 1 or 2).\n\n### Analysis for Next Guess:\n- The secret word must be 5 letters, ending with ""ER"", with N at position 1 or 2, and no excluded letters.\n- Possible candidates:\n  - **N at position 1**: Words like **NUKER** (N _ _ E R). However, ""NUKER"" is uncommon.\n  - **N at position 2**: Words like **UNDER** (_ N _ E R), which is a common word and fits all constraints.\n- **UNDER** is chosen because:\n  - It places N in position 2 (valid, as N cannot be in 3/4/5).\n  - It uses new letters (U, D) to test their presence.\n  - It adheres to all feedback and excluded letters.\n\n<guess>under</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: stern -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) E(-) R(-) N(-)\nGuess 3: miner -> FEEDBACK: M(x) I(x) N(-) E(✓) R(✓)\nGuess 4: under -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) D(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for Guess 4: ""under"" -> U(x) N(-) D(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n\nFrom this:\n- U is absent (x) → The secret word contains no U.\n- N is present but not in position 2 (-) → So N is in the word, but not at position 2.\n- D is absent (x) → The secret word contains no D.\n- E and R are in the correct positions (✓) → Position 4 is E and position 5 is R.\n\nPrevious feedback helps us consolidate information:\n\nFrom Guess 3 (""miner""):\n- E is at position 4 (✓)\n- R is at position 5 (✓)\n- N is present but not at position 3 (-)\n- M and I are absent (x)\n\nFrom Guess 1 (""crane""):\n- N is present but not at position 4 (-) → We already know E is at position 4, so consistent.\n- E is present but not at position 5 (-) → We have E at 4 and R at 5, so position 5 is R, not E.\n\nFrom Guess 2 (""stern""):\n- N is present but not at position 5 (-) → Consistent since position 5 is R.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n1. Positions 4 and 5 are fixed: E and R.\n2. N must be in the word, but cannot be at:\n   - Position 3 (from ""miner"")\n   - Position 4 (from ""crane"" → fixed as E)\n   - Position 5 (from ""stern"" → fixed as R)\n   - Position 2 (from ""under"")\n   So N must be at position 1 (the only position left).\n\nWe also know the absent letters: A, C, I, M, S, T, U, D.\n\nThus, the secret word has structure:\nN _ _ E R\n\nNow, we know the word starts with N, ends with ER, and we need the second and third letters.\n\nWe must be careful:\n- The word is N ? ? E R\n- The third character (position 3) cannot be N (since N is at position 1, and duplicates? We have no evidence of duplicates, but we should consider if necessary. However, the feedback has never indicated duplicates, so we assume distinct letters except when forced).\n\nBut note: we have not had any duplicate marks. Especially in the feedback for ""under"", we have only one N mark (as misplaced at position 2) and no indication of multiple N\'s. Similarly in previous guesses. So likely, only one N.\n\nTherefore: positions 2 and 3 are two distinct letters that are not N, and are not any of the absent letters: A, C, D, I, M, S, T, U.\n\nBut note: E and R are already placed? So they are taken? So we need letters that are not E, R, N? Because each letter appears once? We are not forced, but without duplication signs, we assume distinct.\n\nTherefore, we need two distinct, unused letters for positions 2 and 3.\n\nExcluded letters so far: A, C, D, I, M, S, T, U.\n\nAlso, from guesses, we have tested: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, E, R, N (from first two guesses), M, I, N, E, R (guess 3), U, N, D, E, R (guess 4). So the letters we know are absent are: A, C, D, I, M, S, T, U.\n\nWe can use: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe need to form a word: N ? ? E R\n\nPossible words?\n\nLet\'s think of English words: N ? ? E R\n\n- ""N**O**W E R"" -> ""NOWER"" not common; not valid?\n- ""N**E**E R"" → E at position 2? But we have E at 4? And ""NEER"" is not a standalone word? It\'s poetic for ""never"". Not typically accepted.\n- ""N**I**C E R"" → I and C excluded? C is absent, I absent → invalid.\n- ""N**A**Z E R"" → A is absent → invalid.\n- ""N**O**B E R"" → ""NOBER"" not a word.\n- ""N**O**K E R"" → not common.\n- ""N**O**V E R"" → ""NOVER"" not a word.\n- ""N**U**G E R"" → U is absent → invalid.\n- ""N**O**G E R"" → Not a word.\n- ""N**O**Y E R"" → ""NOYER"" not common.\n- ""N**L**? Weird.\n\nCommon words:\n\n- ""N A G E R"" → A excluded.\n- ""N I C E R"" → excluded.\n- What about ""N E W E R"" → ""NEWER"" → has two E\'s? And E at 2 and 4? \n  - If we try ""NEWER"": \n    - Positions: N1, E2, W3, E4, R5\n    - We already know E at 4 is correct. Now E at 2: that would be a second E? \n    - Is a second E possible? We haven\'t explicitly ruled it out. The feedback for ""miner"" had only one E (at 4) marked correct. We didn\'t test position 2 with E? \n    - So it\'s possible? \n    - But then: the E at position 2 would be a new E? But in ""under"" we didn\'t test position 2 with E? It was N at position 2.\n\n  However, in ""under"" guess, we had U at 1 (absent), N at 2 (present but wrong → so N is not at 2, but if E was at 2, then we haven\'t tested that? Actually, in ""under"" we did not test E at position 2? We had U at 1, N at 2, D at 3, E at 4, R at 5. The feedback for position 2 was N (which got a minus), meaning that N is present but not at 2. It doesn\'t say anything about E? But position 2 was occupied by N, not E.\n\n  So the secret word having E at 2 is possible? Only if E is duplicated. Because E at 2 is not at 4? We know E at 4 is correct. \n\n  To avoid complexity, perhaps assume no duplicates? Since we haven\'t seen any.\n\n  But let me see: previous guesses tested only one E? In ""crane"", E was at 5; in ""stern"", E at 3; in ""miner"", E at 4 (correct); in ""under"", E at 4 (correct). So position 2 has never been tested? And we don\'t know if E is duplicated? \n\n  However, given that only position 1 remains for N, we must consider words with N at 1 and any letters at 2 and 3.\n\n  ""NEWER"" is a valid word? Yes.\n\n  But we have ""E"" twice? We don\'t know? We can test.\n\n  Another option: ""NUKER"" but U is excluded → we learned U is absent in guess 4.\n\n  ""NUKER"" is invalid because U is absent.\n\n  Similarly, ""NUDER"" has D and U? Both absent? Invalid.\n\n  Now, ""NEWER"": N1, E2, W3, E4, R5.\n\n  Constraints: \n  - N at 1: allowed? Yes (since N must be at 1 or 2? Now we know N must be at 1 because position 2 is ruled out by guess 4? Yes: from guess 4, N cannot be at 2, and positions 3,4,5 are out? So N must be at position 1. So that\'s fine.\n  - E at 4: correct? We know that\'s fixed.\n  - R at 5: fixed.\n  - At position 2: E? Would that be a duplicate E? We don\'t know? \n  - But the word ""NEWER"" is common? Yes.\n\n  However, we have E at position 2? That is, the secret word would have E at 2 and 4? But we only knew about one E? But it\'s possible.\n\n  Also, included letter W? We haven\'t tested W.\n\n  But let\'s check against feedback: \n\n  We know the secret word has E at 4 and R at 5. In guessing ""NEWER"", we would test:\n\n    Position 1: N → if N is at 1, it will be correct? We suspect N is at 1? \n    Position 2: E → is E present? But we already have E at 4? So if there is another E, it would show as minus or check? \n    Actually, in ""NEWER"", we have E at 2 and E at 4. The E at 4 would show as check? The E at 2? We haven\'t placed E at 2 before? \n\n  But in the feedback rules: \n    ✓: letter in correct position\n    -: letter in word but not this position\n    x: letter not in word\n\n  If we guess ""NEWER"" and the secret word has only one E (at position 4), then:\n    Position 1: N? If N is at 1, check? \n    Position 2: E? But the secret word does not have E at 2? And if no duplicate, then this E is not present? So it would be x? \n\n  But we think the secret word has N at 1? Then position 1 N is ✓, position 4 E ✓, position 5 R ✓? Position 2 E? If the word has no other E, then E at 2 would be x? Position 3 W: if not in the word, x.\n\n  But we are almost sure that N is at 1? \n\n  Alternatively, the word could be ""NONER""? But not a word? \n\n  Another possibility: ""NOYER""? Not a word? \n\nCommon words: ""NEWER"" or ""NEVER""?\n\n  ""NEVER"": N1, E2, V3, E4, R5.\n\n  That seems a very common word.\n\n  With V? We haven\'t tested V.\n\n  Now, we can choose ""NEVER"".\n\n  Why? Because it uses V? \n\n  But note: we have 6 tries? This is guess 5? We have to get it.\n\n  We are certain about positions 1,4,5? Only position 1 is not 100% confirmed? We deduced N must be at 1? \n\n  How sure? \n\n  From all constraints: \n    N must be in the word. \n    Tried at positions: 2 (under: no), 3 (miner: no), 4 (crane: no), 5 (stern: no). Only position 1 left? \n\n  So positions 5 and 4 are taken? Position 3 cannot have N because miner feedback: N was at 3 and got a minus? Position 2 cannot have N because under feedback: N at 2 and got minus? \n\n  So absolute: N must be at position 1.\n\n  Therefore, the word is N _ _ E R.\n\n  So we don\'t need to hope for ""NEWER"" with duplicate E? That was just an example.\n\n  Now, for the second and third positions: two distinct letters from the available set. \n\n  We need to list possible words.\n\n  N _ _ E R\n\n  Possibilities:\n\n  - With second letter O: \n      ""N_O_ER"": ""NO?ER"" -> ""NOVER"", ""NOBER"", ""NOGER"" → all not words? \n      ""NONER"" → not common? \n      ""NOW ER"" → not words.\n\n  - With second letter L:\n      ""NL?ER"" → ""NLYER"" no? ""NILER"" has I → invalid.\n\n  - With second letter K:\n      ""N K ? E R"": ""NKE"" -> ""NACKER"" too long? \n      ""N K E E R"" → ""NKEER"" not a word? \n      But also ""NUKER"" invalid? \n\n  Common words: \n\n  - ""NEVER"": N E V E R → duplicate E? \n  - ""NICER"": but I and C excluded → no.\n  - ""NAKER"": not a word? and A excluded.\n\n  Another word: ""N O B L E R""? Too long.\n\n  How about ""N O P E R"" → ""NOPER"" not a word? \n\n  Another idea: ""N I G E R"" → I excluded.\n\n  What about ""NYMPH"" not ending ER.\n\n  We must have ER ending.\n\n  Valid words: \n\n  - ""NEWER"": N E W E R → but duplicate E? \n  - ""NEVER"": yes, common word? \n  - ""NONER"": rarely used? \n  - ""NOXER""? no.\n\n  I found ""NOBBY"" not ER.\n\n  Perhaps ""JEWER"" not? \n\n  Another: ""H E W E R"" not starting with N.\n\n  We need 5 letters: starting with N, ending with ER.\n\n  Common words: \n    - ""NAKER"" → no. \n    - ""NARKY"" no? \n\n  ""NEVER"" is acceptable? Or ""BONER"" not.\n\n  So let me try ""NEVER"": \n    Positions: 1: N, 2: E, 3: V, 4: E, 5: R.\n\n  Constraints for E: we know E can be at 1,2,4? From previous? From Guess 1: E not position 5? Guess 2: E not position 3? But now E at position 2? That\'s a new position? So allowed? \n\n  But we have E at position 2 and position 4? We previously had only one E confirmed? \n\n  We can guess ""NEVER"" and see? \n\n  But we have to form it.\n\n  Alternatively, ""NIXER"" has I→ excluded.\n\n  ""NUDER""→ D excluded.\n\n  ""NOYER""→ not common.\n\n  ""NOKER""→ not common.\n\n  ""N WER""? Not.\n\n  So ""NEVER"" seems the most common? \n\n  But let me confirm: ""NEWER"" is another option? Also common? \n\n  But ""NEWER"" has two E\'s? \n\n  So possible words: ""NEVER"", ""NEWER"", ""NO?ER"" (if any), but minimal choice.\n\n  To be safe, let\'s choose ""NEVER"".\n\n  Why? Because even if there are two E\'s, it was not ruled out? \n\n  Also, V is a new letter? We haven\'t tested V.\n\n  In guess 4 we tested U (absent), D (absent), so we try V now.\n\n  If V is in the word, we get feedback? \n\n  So guess ""NEVER"". \n\n  Alternatively, we could try a word like ""N W E R"" but with two letters? \n\n  Since the word is ""N _ _ E R"", and we are at guess 5? We have only two positions unknown? \n\n  Perhaps optimize by using more common letters? \n\n  For example, we can try a word with common unused letters? Like O, L, etc.\n\n  But in ""NEVER"", we use E again at position 2? But that is also a test for duplicate E.\n\n  But we have nothing else? \n\n  Given the time, I choose ""NEVER"".\n\n  So the guess is ""NEVER""\n\n  Feedback will reveal if E is duplicated? \n\n  If the word is ""NEVER"", we get: \n    Position1: N (if at 1, should be ✓)\n    Position2: E? Could be ✓, - or x? \n        If the secret word has E only at 4, then E at 2 would be x? \n        But we suspect some words have E at 2? \n    Position3: V? \n    Positions4 and 5: E and R: ✓\n\n  Or if the word is ""NEWER"", same thing.\n\n  But let\'s not give up: another word? ""NOTER""? N O T E R? But T is excluded → from guess 2, T is absent? \n\n  So T cannot be used.\n\n  Therefore, no ""NOTER"". \n\n  ""LOSER"" → doesn\'t start with N.\n\n  The only common one left is ""NEVER"".\n\n  So I\'ll guess ""NEVER"". \n\n  But note: we have 6 guesses? And this is guess 5? We have one more if wrong.\n\n  But we might be able to do better.\n\n  Wait: ""NEVER"" has E at position 2? That position was not tested before? \n\n  Perhaps try ""NOVER"" or ""NOBER"" → not words? \n\n  What about ""N I G H T"" → not ER.\n\n  After research, ""NEVER"" is a valid option? \n\n  Another: ""NE PER"" → not.\n\n  So reluctantly, ""NEVER"". \n\n  Or ""NEWER""? Both are valid.\n\n  But ""NEWER"" uses W? \n\n  They are similar.\n\n  But here is the problem: we don\'t know how many E\'s? \n\n  Since we are forced to, let me pick ""NEVER"" because it\'s more common.\n\n  So guessed word: ""NEVER""\n\n  But note: we haven\'t tested position 2? We have tried position 2 only with letters: in ""crane"" position 2 was R? Then ""miner"" had M (absent) at 2? ""under"" had N at 2 (which was misplaced)? \n\n  So position 2 has been tested with R (miner had not at 2? We didn\'t test specifically position 2? Not by letter but with those letters? \n\n  Actually, we know that whatever letter is at position 2, we haven\'t tested that possible letter being present or absent? \n\n  So guessing is inevitable? \n\n  Therefore, I\'ll proceed.\n\n  But logically, what are the possible words? The only common word with structure N _ _ E R and no excluded letters is ""NEVER"" or ""NEWER""? \n\n  Yes.\n\n  So this is the guess.\n\n<guess>never</guess>Based on all previous feedback:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n1. **Fixed Positions**:\n   - Positions 4 (E) and 5 (R) are confirmed correct (✓ from Guess 3 and 4).\n\n2. **N must be at Position 1**:\n   - N is present but rules out:\n     - Position 2 (Guess 4: `under` → N(-)).\n     - Position 3 (Guess 3: `miner` → N(-)).\n     - Position 4 (Guess 1: `crane` → N(-)).\n     - Position 5 (Guess 2: `stern` → N(-)).\n   - Only position 1 remains ⇒ **N must be at position 1**.\n\n3. **Word Structure**:\n   - Secret word is **N _ _ E R**.\n   - Position 3 is not N (no duplicates indicated).\n   - Positions 2 and 3 require distinct letters not excluded.\n\n4. **Absent Letters**:\n   - C, A, S, T (from early guesses).\n   - M, I (Guess 3).\n   - U, D (Guess 4).\n   - Letters available: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n5. **Possible Words**:\n   - Common candidates fitting `N _ _ E R` include **NEWER** (N,E,W,E,R) or **NEVER** (N,E,V,E,R), despite duplicated E (not explicitly ruled out).\n   - Given exclusão lists, **NEVER** is selected as the most common valid word.

We have feedback for Guess 5: ""never"" -> N(✓) E(✓) V(x) E(✓) R(✓)

This means:
- N at position 1 is correct (✓)
- E at position 2 is correct (✓)  [Note: This is the second E in the word? But we have two E's in ""never""]
- V at position 3 is absent (x)
- E at position 4 is correct (✓) [but we already knew that]
- R at position 5 is correct (✓) [known]

So the secret word has:
  Position 1: N
  Position 2: E
  Position 3: ? (not V, and not any other excluded letter)
  Position 4: E
  Position 5: R

But note: we have two E's in the guess, and the feedback shows:
  The first E (at position 2) is correct (✓)
  The second E (at position 4) is correct (✓)
  And the V at 3 is absent.

However, the secret word must have an E at position 2 and an E at position 4? But we already knew about position 4. The new information is that position 2 is also E.

But wait: the secret word has two E's? Because we have E at 2 and E at 4? And both are marked as correct? So the secret word has at least two E's? 

But in the feedback for ""never"", we have:
  Position 1: N (✓) -> correct
  Position 2: E (✓) -> correct
  Position 3: V (x) -> not in word
  Position 4: E (✓) -> correct
  Position 5: R (✓) -> correct

So the secret word is: N E ? E R, and the missing letter at position 3 is not V, and must be a letter that is not excluded.

We also know that the secret word does not contain: A, C, D, I, M, S, T, U, V (from this guess).

So the missing letter at position 3 must be one of: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z.

But we need to form a valid English word.

What words are there? ""NE?ER""

Common words:
  ""NEVER"" -> but we just guessed it, and V is absent? So not.
  ""NEWER"" -> W at position 3? 
  ""NEATER"" -> too long? 
  ""NEEER"" -> not a word.

5-letter words: 
  ""NEVER"" (ruled out by V absent)
  ""NEWER"" (with W) -> valid word? Yes, meaning more new.

Also, ""NEG ER"" -> ""NEGER""? Not acceptable? 
  ""NE PER"" -> ""NEPER""? A unit in physics? Valid? Yes.

But let's list:

- ""NEWER"": N E W E R
- ""NEPER"": N E P E R
- ""NEVER"": ruled out
- ""NELE""? not.

So possible: ""NEWER"" and ""NEPER"".

But we have to check if they are valid and not excluded.

For ""NEWER"": 
  Position 3: W -> not excluded? We haven't tested W? So it's possible.

For ""NEPER"": 
  Position 3: P -> not excluded? Also possible.

We also have ""JEWER""? Not.

""HEWER""? Not starting with NE.

So two candidates: ""NEWER"" and ""NEPER"".

We have one guess left? We are at guess 6? Or guess 5 was the fifth? We have one more.

But we have to choose one.

We can try ""NEWER"" because it's more common? Or ""NEPER"" is less common.

But we have to pick.

Alternatively, we can see which one fits the previous feedback? 

But we have no information about position 3? 

We can choose ""NEWER"" to test W? 

But we have only one guess? We must be correct.

Since we have two possibilities, we can choose the more common one.

""NEWER"" is more common than ""NEPER"".

So I'll go with ""NEWER"".

But note: in ""never"", we had V at 3 and it was absent? So if we guess ""NEWER"", we have W at 3? 

If the word is ""NEWER"", then we get all correct? 

If it is ""NEPER"", then we get P at 3? 

But we don't know.

We can also consider: in the first guess ""crane"", we had no information about position 3? 

But we have to decide.

Perhaps we missed a word? 

Another word: ""NEVEL""? Not ending with ER.

""NEEM""? Not.

So only two.

I think ""NEWER"" is a better choice.

So the sixth guess: ""NEWER""

But note: the secret word might be ""NEVER"" but we know V is absent? So it cannot be.

Therefore, the only other common word is ""NEWER"".

So we guess ""NEWER"".

### Analysis of Feedback for Guess 5 (""never""):
- **N(✓)**: Position 1 is **N** (correct).
- **E(✓)**: Position 2 is **E** (correct).  
  **→ New info:** The secret word has **E at position 2** (previously unknown).
- **V(x)**: **V** is absent from the word.
- **E(✓)**: Position 4 is **E** (already known).
- **R(✓)**: Position 5 is **R** (already known).

### Deductions:
1. **Secret word structure**: **N E _ E R**  
   - Only position 3 is unknown.
2. **Absent letters** (total): A, C, D, I, M, S, T, U, V.  
3. **Position 3 constraints**:  
   - Must be a letter **not excluded** (i.e., from: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z).  
   - Must form a valid English word with ""NE_ER"".  

### Possible Words:
- **NEWER** (N E W E R): ""W"" is untested and fits constraints.  
- **NEPER** (N E P E R): ""P"" is untested and fits constraints.  
- Other options (e.g., ""NEVER"") are invalid (V is absent).  

### Strategy:
- **NEWER** is selected because:  
  - It is a common word.  
  - Tests ""W"" (high-value letter for information).  
  - If incorrect, ""NEPER"" would be the only other candidate.
