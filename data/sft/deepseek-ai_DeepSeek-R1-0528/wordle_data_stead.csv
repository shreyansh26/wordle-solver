We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters A and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"". 
   Specifically, A was in position 3 and E in position 5 of ""crane"", so in the secret word, A is not at position 3 and E is not at position 5.
 - The letters C, R, and N are not in the word at all.

 We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
 - Includes A and E (since they are present in the secret word) but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively.
 - Does not include C, R, or N.

 Also, we have 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.

 Let's think of a word that uses common letters and avoids C, R, N.

 We know the word has A and E. We can try to place A and E in new positions.

 Since A was in position 3 and now must be elsewhere, we can try A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
 Similarly, E was in position 5 and now must be elsewhere, so we can try E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 However, we also want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Common consonants (besides C, R, N which are out) are: S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.

 Let's try to form a word that includes A and E, and also some of these common consonants.

 We also note that we have two letters that are present (A and E) and three that are absent (C, R, N). So we have 3 new letters to test.

 Possible strategy: use a word that has A and E in new positions and three new letters.

 Example: 
   Position 1: new letter (say S)
   Position 2: A (since A was not at 3, we try 2)
   Position 3: new letter (say T)
   Position 4: new letter (say L)
   Position 5: E (but wait, E was at position 5 in the first guess and was marked as present but wrong position? Actually, the feedback for E was '-' meaning it is in the word but not at position 5. So we cannot put E at position 5 again? Actually, we can, because the feedback only said it's not at position 5, but it might be at position 5 in a different word? No, the same word? The secret word is fixed. The feedback for the first guess: E was at position 5 and was marked as '-' meaning that in the secret word, E is present but not at position 5. Therefore, in the next guess, we should avoid putting E at position 5. Similarly, A should not be at position 3.

 However, note: the feedback does not prevent us from putting E at position 5 again? But that would be a waste because we know it's not there. So we should put E in a different position.

 But wait: the feedback says that E is in the word but not at position 5. So we must put E in one of positions 1,2,3,4.

 Similarly, A must be in one of positions 1,2,4,5 (but note: in the first guess, A was at position 3, so we avoid 3).

 However, we have two letters A and E to place. We must also include them.

 Let me try to form a word:

 Option: ""SALET"" is a common word in word games, but let's check:
   S at 1, A at 2, L at 3, E at 4, T at 5.

 But note: we must avoid putting A at position 3? Actually, in this word, A is at position 2, which is allowed. And E is at position 4, which is not 5 so allowed.

 However, we also know that the secret word does not have C, R, N. So ""SALET"" uses S, A, L, E, T. None of C, R, N. So it's okay.

 But wait: what about the letter L? We don't know if L is in the word. Similarly, S and T.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has the letter E in a different position and A in a different position, and also tests other vowels? But we know the word has A and E, so we don't need to test other vowels necessarily.

 However, we don't know if there are more letters. We only know two letters so far.

 Another idea: we can try to use a word that has both A and E and also includes other common letters that we haven't tested, such as S, T, L, D, etc.

 Let me list some words that have A and E and avoid C, R, N:

 - slate: S, L, A, T, E -> positions: A at 3? But we must avoid A at position 3? Because in the first guess, A was at position 3 and was marked as present but wrong position. So in the secret word, A is not at position 3. Therefore, in ""slate"", if we put A at position 3, that would be the same position as before? And we know it's not there. So we should avoid that.

 How about ""steal"": 
   S, T, E, A, L -> 
   position 1: S
   position 2: T
   position 3: E (this is a new position for E, since E was at 5 before)
   position 4: A (this is a new position for A, since A was at 3 before)
   position 5: L

 This seems good: 
   E is at 3 (not 5) and A is at 4 (not 3). 

 But note: we are not sure if E can be at 3? The feedback only said E is in the word but not at 5. It could be at 3.

 Similarly, A is at 4, which is not 3.

 Also, the word ""steal"" uses S, T, E, A, L. We haven't ruled out S, T, L.

 Another option: ""least"" -> 
   L, E, A, S, T -> 
   E at 2 (not 5) and A at 3 -> but wait, we cannot put A at 3 because we know A is not at position 3 in the secret word. So ""least"" is invalid for A at position 3.

 How about ""tales"":
   T, A, L, E, S -> 
   A at 2 (okay, not 3) and E at 4 (okay, not 5).

 So ""tales"" is acceptable.

 But note: we want to maximize information. We have two known letters (A and E) and we are testing three new ones (T, L, S). 

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't repeat the positions of A and E and also uses common letters.

 Another common word: ""adieu"" but that has D, I, U and we don't know about them, but also it has A and E. However, we have two vowels already and we might get less information about consonants.

 Since we have two vowels (A and E) already, we might focus on consonants.

 I think ""steal"" or ""tales"" are good.

 But let me check: in ""steal"", we have:
   S, T, E, A, L

 We are testing S, T, L and also confirming A and E in new positions.

 However, note that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

 I'll go with ""steal"".

 But wait: the feedback for the first guess had A and E as present. So the word must have at least one A and one E.

 In ""steal"", we have one A and one E.

 So, let's guess ""steal"".

 However, note: we must make sure that ""steal"" is a valid word. Yes, it is.

 Therefore, my next guess is ""steal"".

<guess>steal</guess>

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, N** are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **A** is in the word but **not in position 3** (marked ""-"").
- **E** is in the word but **not in position 5** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** and **E** (since they are in the secret word), but **A cannot be in position 3** and **E cannot be in position 5**.
- Must **avoid C, R, N** entirely.
- Aim to test new common letters (e.g., **S, T, L**) to gather more information.

The word **""STEAL""** fits these criteria:
- Places **A in position 4** (new position, avoiding 3).
- Places **E in position 3** (new position, avoiding 5).
- Tests new letters: **S, T, L**.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, N).

This maximizes information while adhering to the feedback.

 But wait: what about the letter L? We don't know if L is in the word. Similarly, S and T.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has the letter E in a different position and A in a different position, and also tests other vowels? But we know the word has A and E, so we don't need to test other vowels necessarily.

 However, we don't know if there are more letters. We only know two letters so far.

 Another idea: we can try to use a word that has both A and E and also includes other common letters that we haven't tested, such as S, T, L, D, etc.

 Let me list some words that have A and E and avoid C, R, N:

 - slate: S, L, A, T, E -> positions: A at 3? But we must avoid A at position 3? Because in the first guess, A was at position 3 and was marked as present but wrong position. So in the secret word, A is not at position 3. Therefore, in ""slate"", if we put A at position 3, that would be the same position as before? And we know it's not there. So we should avoid that.

 How about ""steal"": 
   S, T, E, A, L -> 
   position 1: S
   position 2: T
   position 3: E (this is a new position for E, since E was at 5 before)
   position 4: A (this is a new position for A, since A was at 3 before)
   position 5: L

 This seems good: 
   E is at 3 (not 5) and A is at 4 (not 3). 

 But note: we are not sure if E can be at 3? The feedback only said E is in the word but not at 5. It could be at 3.

 Similarly, A is at 4, which is not 3.

 Also, the word ""steal"" uses S, T, E, A, L. We haven't ruled out S, T, L.

 Another option: ""least"" -> 
   L, E, A, S, T -> 
   E at 2 (not 5) and A at 3 -> but wait, we cannot put A at 3 because we know A is not at position 3 in the secret word. So ""least"" is invalid for A at position 3.

 How about ""tales"":
   T, A, L, E, S -> 
   A at 2 (okay, not 3) and E at 4 (okay, not 5).

 So ""tales"" is acceptable.

 But note: we want to maximize information. We have two known letters (A and E) and we are testing three new ones (T, L, S). 

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't repeat the positions of A and E and also uses common letters.

 Another common word: ""adieu"" but that has D, I, U and we don't know about them, but also it has A and E. However, we have two vowels already and we might get less information about consonants.

 Since we have two vowels (A and E) already, we might focus on consonants.

 I think ""steal"" or ""tales"" are good.

 But let me check: in ""steal"", we have:
   S, T, E, A, L

 We are testing S, T, L and also confirming A and E in new positions.

 However, note that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

 I'll go with ""steal"".

 But wait: the feedback for the first guess had A and E as present. So the word must have at least one A and one E.

 In ""steal"", we have one A and one E.

 So, let's guess ""steal"".

 However, note: we must make sure that ""steal"" is a valid word. Yes, it is.

 Therefore, my next guess is ""steal"".

<guess>steal</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, N** are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **A** is in the word but **not in position 3** (marked ""-"").
- **E** is in the word but **not in position 5** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** and **E** (since they are in the secret word), but **A cannot be in position 3** and **E cannot be in position 5**.
- Must **avoid C, R, N** entirely.
- Aim to test new common letters (e.g., **S, T, L**) to gather more information.

The word **""STEAL""** fits these criteria:
- Places **A in position 4** (new position, avoiding 3).
- Places **E in position 3** (new position, avoiding 5).
- Tests new letters: **S, T, L**.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, N).

This maximizes information while adhering to the feedback.

We are given feedback for two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
   - This means: C, R, N are not in the word at all.
   - A is in the word but not at position 3.
   - E is in the word but not at position 5.

2. ""steal"" -> S(✓) T(✓) E(✓) A(✓) L(x)
   - This means: S is correct at position 1, T is correct at position 2, E is correct at position 3, A is correct at position 4, and L is not in the word.

From guess 2, we know:
- The secret word has S at position 1, T at position 2, E at position 3, and A at position 4.
- So the secret word so far is: S, T, E, A, ?

Additionally, L is not in the word (marked x).

Also, from guess 1, we know:
- C, R, N are not in the word.
- And we already used E and A, and now we know their positions.

So the secret word is: [S][T][E][A][?]

We need to find the last letter.

The last letter must be a letter that is not C, R, N (from guess1) and not L (from guess2). Also, it must form a valid English word.

We must avoid: C, R, N, L.

What are possible letters for the last position?

The word is ""STEA?"" and must be a valid 5-letter word.

Let's think of words that start with ""STEA"":

- steak (K is a possible letter)
- steam (M is a possible letter)
- steal (but we guessed steal and L is not in the word, and also we have L marked x so it cannot be steal)
- stead (D is a possible letter)
- steak (K) is another

But note: our secret word cannot have the last letter as L because we already got L as x.

Also, from guess1, we know E is in the word but not at position 5? It was at position 5 in ""crane"", but now we have it at position 3. So that's consistent.

The letters we have ruled out: C, R, N, L.

Also, note that in guess1 we had A at position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. Now we have A at position 4 and it's correct. This is consistent because the position changed.

Similarly, E was at position 5 in guess1 and now at position 3.

So the last letter must be a consonant (since it's the last letter of a word) and must form a word.

Possible words:

- steak (with K)
- steam (with M)
- stead (with D)

Are there others? Probably not common ones.

Now, we need to guess one. Since we have 6 tries and we are on guess 3, we can try to guess one of these.

But note: we don't have any feedback on other letters. We need to confirm.

Since we already have four letters correctly placed, we just need to find the last letter.

We can try ""steak"" because K is a common letter.

But we must avoid letters that are already ruled out: K is not in the ruled out list (which is C, R, N, L). So K is okay.

Similarly, M and D are okay.

We might try ""steak"" as a guess.

But note: we are allowed to make multiple guesses? We have 6 tries.

Alternatively, we could make a guess that tests several possibilities? But that might be inefficient because we have so many letters fixed.

Let me think: We have the pattern STEA_. We have to put a letter in the last spot.

We can try one of the possibilities.

But note: we have no information about K, M, or D. So we just need to choose one.

Let me prioritize by common words.

""Steak"" and ""steam"" are both very common. ""Stead"" is less common.

So between ""steak"" and ""steam"", I'll pick ""steak"" because I'm thinking of food. But that's arbitrary.

Alternatively, we can look for which one avoids repeating letters? But all letters are already in the word? The word will have S, T, E, A, and one more. We don't think there are duplicates because we haven't seen any duplicate feedback.

In guess2, we had S,T,E,A,L and only L was absent, so no duplicates.

Similarly in guess1, no duplicates.

So probably no duplicate letters.

So let's try ""steak"".

If ""steak"" is correct, we win. If not, then we know it is either ""steam"" or ""stead"", and we can try next.

But note: we have only 6 tries and we are on guess 3, so we can risk.

Let's guess ""steak"".

So the guess is ""steak"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: Letters **C, R, N** are not in the secret word. Letters **A** and **E** are in the word but not in positions 3 or 5, respectively.
- **Guess 2 (""steal"")**: Letters **S, T, E, A** are correct and in positions 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Letter **L** is not in the word.

### Deductions:
- The secret word starts with **""STEA""** (positions 1-4 confirmed).
- The last letter (position 5) is unknown and must form a valid English word.
- The last letter cannot be **L** (ruled out by ""steal"") or **C, R, N** (ruled out by ""crane"").

### Possible Words:
The last letter must complete a 5-letter word starting with ""STEA"". Common options include:
- **steak** (with K)
- **steam** (with M)
- **stead** (with D)

### Thought Process for Next Guess:
- With four letters confirmed, the goal is to test the last unknown letter.
- ""steak"" is a common word and tests the letter **K**. This maximizes efficiency since we might solve in one guess.
- If incorrect, we eliminate **K** and narrow to other candidates (e.g., ""steam"" or ""stead"") for subsequent guesses.

   - This means: C, R, N are not in the word at all.

   - E is in the word but not at position 5.

2. ""steal"" -> S(✓) T(✓) E(✓) A(✓) L(x)
   - This means: S is correct at position 1, T is correct at position 2, E is correct at position 3, A is correct at position 4, and L is not in the word.

From guess 2, we know:
- The secret word has S at position 1, T at position 2, E at position 3, and A at position 4.
- So the secret word so far is: S, T, E, A, ?

Additionally, L is not in the word (marked x).

Also, from guess 1, we know:
- C, R, N are not in the word.
- And we already used E and A, and now we know their positions.

So the secret word is: [S][T][E][A][?]

We need to find the last letter.

The last letter must be a letter that is not C, R, N (from guess1) and not L (from guess2). Also, it must form a valid English word.

We must avoid: C, R, N, L.

What are possible letters for the last position?

The word is ""STEA?"" and must be a valid 5-letter word.

Let's think of words that start with ""STEA"":

- steak (K is a possible letter)
- steam (M is a possible letter)
- steal (but we guessed steal and L is not in the word, and also we have L marked x so it cannot be steal)
- stead (D is a possible letter)
- steak (K) is another

But note: our secret word cannot have the last letter as L because we already got L as x.

Also, from guess1, we know E is in the word but not at position 5? It was at position 5 in ""crane"", but now we have it at position 3. So that's consistent.

The letters we have ruled out: C, R, N, L.

Also, note that in guess1 we had A at position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. Now we have A at position 4 and it's correct. This is consistent because the position changed.

Similarly, E was at position 5 in guess1 and now at position 3.

So the last letter must be a consonant (since it's the last letter of a word) and must form a word.

Possible words:

- steak (with K)
- steam (with M)
- stead (with D)

Are there others? Probably not common ones.

Now, we need to guess one. Since we have 6 tries and we are on guess 3, we can try to guess one of these.

But note: we don't have any feedback on other letters. We need to confirm.

Since we already have four letters correctly placed, we just need to find the last letter.

We can try ""steak"" because K is a common letter.

But we must avoid letters that are already ruled out: K is not in the ruled out list (which is C, R, N, L). So K is okay.

Similarly, M and D are okay.

We might try ""steak"" as a guess.

So probably no duplicate letters.

So let's try ""steak"".

 - The secret word contains the letters A and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"". 
   Specifically, A was in position 3 and E in position 5 of ""crane"", so in the secret word, A is not at position 3 and E is not at position 5.
 - The letters C, R, and N are not in the word at all.

 We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
 - Includes A and E (since they are present in the secret word) but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively.
 - Does not include C, R, or N.

 Also, we have 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.

 Let's think of a word that uses common letters and avoids C, R, N.

 We know the word has A and E. We can try to place A and E in new positions.

 Since A was in position 3 and now must be elsewhere, we can try A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
 Similarly, E was in position 5 and now must be elsewhere, so we can try E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 However, we also want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Common consonants (besides C, R, N which are out) are: S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.

 Let's try to form a word that includes A and E, and also some of these common consonants.

 We also note that we have two letters that are present (A and E) and three that are absent (C, R, N). So we have 3 new letters to test.

 Possible strategy: use a word that has A and E in new positions and three new letters.

 Example: 
   Position 1: new letter (say S)
   Position 2: A (since A was not at 3, we try 2)
   Position 3: new letter (say T)
   Position 4: new letter (say L)
   Position 5: E (but wait, E was at position 5 in the first guess and was marked as present but wrong position? Actually, the feedback for E was '-' meaning it is in the word but not at position 5. So we cannot put E at position 5 again? Actually, we can, because the feedback only said it's not at position 5, but it might be at position 5 in a different word? No, the same word? The secret word is fixed. The feedback for the first guess: E was at position 5 and was marked as '-' meaning that in the secret word, E is present but not at position 5. Therefore, in the next guess, we should avoid putting E at position 5. Similarly, A should not be at position 3.

 However, note: the feedback does not prevent us from putting E at position 5 again? But that would be a waste because we know it's not there. So we should put E in a different position.

 But wait: the feedback says that E is in the word but not at position 5. So we must put E in one of positions 1,2,3,4.

 Similarly, A must be in one of positions 1,2,4,5 (but note: in the first guess, A was at position 3, so we avoid 3).

 However, we have two letters A and E to place. We must also include them.

 Let me try to form a word:

 Option: ""SALET"" is a common word in word games, but let's check:
   S at 1, A at 2, L at 3, E at 4, T at 5.

 But note: we must avoid putting A at position 3? Actually, in this word, A is at position 2, which is allowed. And E is at position 4, which is not 5 so allowed.

 However, we also know that the secret word does not have C, R, N. So ""SALET"" uses S, A, L, E, T. None of C, R, N. So it's okay.

 But wait: what about the letter L? We don't know if L is in the word. Similarly, S and T.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has the letter E in a different position and A in a different position, and also tests other vowels? But we know the word has A and E, so we don't need to test other vowels necessarily.

 However, we don't know if there are more letters. We only know two letters so far.

 Another idea: we can try to use a word that has both A and E and also includes other common letters that we haven't tested, such as S, T, L, D, etc.

 Let me list some words that have A and E and avoid C, R, N:

 - slate: S, L, A, T, E -> positions: A at 3? But we must avoid A at position 3? Because in the first guess, A was at position 3 and was marked as present but wrong position. So in the secret word, A is not at position 3. Therefore, in ""slate"", if we put A at position 3, that would be the same position as before? And we know it's not there. So we should avoid that.

 How about ""steal"": 
   S, T, E, A, L -> 
   position 1: S
   position 2: T
   position 3: E (this is a new position for E, since E was at 5 before)
   position 4: A (this is a new position for A, since A was at 3 before)
   position 5: L

 This seems good: 
   E is at 3 (not 5) and A is at 4 (not 3). 

 But note: we are not sure if E can be at 3? The feedback only said E is in the word but not at 5. It could be at 3.

 Similarly, A is at 4, which is not 3.

 Also, the word ""steal"" uses S, T, E, A, L. We haven't ruled out S, T, L.

 Another option: ""least"" -> 
   L, E, A, S, T -> 
   E at 2 (not 5) and A at 3 -> but wait, we cannot put A at 3 because we know A is not at position 3 in the secret word. So ""least"" is invalid for A at position 3.

 How about ""tales"":
   T, A, L, E, S -> 
   A at 2 (okay, not 3) and E at 4 (okay, not 5).

 So ""tales"" is acceptable.

 But note: we want to maximize information. We have two known letters (A and E) and we are testing three new ones (T, L, S). 

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't repeat the positions of A and E and also uses common letters.

 Another common word: ""adieu"" but that has D, I, U and we don't know about them, but also it has A and E. However, we have two vowels already and we might get less information about consonants.

 Since we have two vowels (A and E) already, we might focus on consonants.

 I think ""steal"" or ""tales"" are good.

 But let me check: in ""steal"", we have:
   S, T, E, A, L

 We are testing S, T, L and also confirming A and E in new positions.

 However, note that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

 I'll go with ""steal"".

 But wait: the feedback for the first guess had A and E as present. So the word must have at least one A and one E.

 In ""steal"", we have one A and one E.

 So, let's guess ""steal"".

 However, note: we must make sure that ""steal"" is a valid word. Yes, it is.

 Therefore, my next guess is ""steal"".

<guess>steal</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, N** are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **A** is in the word but **not in position 3** (marked ""-"").
- **E** is in the word but **not in position 5** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** and **E** (since they are in the secret word), but **A cannot be in position 3** and **E cannot be in position 5**.
- Must **avoid C, R, N** entirely.
- Aim to test new common letters (e.g., **S, T, L**) to gather more information.

The word **""STEAL""** fits these criteria:
- Places **A in position 4** (new position, avoiding 3).
- Places **E in position 3** (new position, avoiding 5).
- Tests new letters: **S, T, L**.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, N).

This maximizes information while adhering to the feedback.

<guess>steal</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: steal -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) E(✓) A(✓) L(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
   - This means: C, R, N are not in the word at all.
   - A is in the word but not at position 3.
   - E is in the word but not at position 5.

2. ""steal"" -> S(✓) T(✓) E(✓) A(✓) L(x)
   - This means: S is correct at position 1, T is correct at position 2, E is correct at position 3, A is correct at position 4, and L is not in the word.

From guess 2, we know:
- The secret word has S at position 1, T at position 2, E at position 3, and A at position 4.
- So the secret word so far is: S, T, E, A, ?

Additionally, L is not in the word (marked x).

Also, from guess 1, we know:
- C, R, N are not in the word.
- And we already used E and A, and now we know their positions.

So the secret word is: [S][T][E][A][?]

We need to find the last letter.

The last letter must be a letter that is not C, R, N (from guess1) and not L (from guess2). Also, it must form a valid English word.

We must avoid: C, R, N, L.

What are possible letters for the last position?

The word is ""STEA?"" and must be a valid 5-letter word.

Let's think of words that start with ""STEA"":

- steak (K is a possible letter)
- steam (M is a possible letter)
- steal (but we guessed steal and L is not in the word, and also we have L marked x so it cannot be steal)
- stead (D is a possible letter)
- steak (K) is another

But note: our secret word cannot have the last letter as L because we already got L as x.

Also, from guess1, we know E is in the word but not at position 5? It was at position 5 in ""crane"", but now we have it at position 3. So that's consistent.

The letters we have ruled out: C, R, N, L.

Also, note that in guess1 we had A at position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. Now we have A at position 4 and it's correct. This is consistent because the position changed.

Similarly, E was at position 5 in guess1 and now at position 3.

So the last letter must be a consonant (since it's the last letter of a word) and must form a word.

Possible words:

- steak (with K)
- steam (with M)
- stead (with D)

Are there others? Probably not common ones.

Now, we need to guess one. Since we have 6 tries and we are on guess 3, we can try to guess one of these.

But note: we don't have any feedback on other letters. We need to confirm.

Since we already have four letters correctly placed, we just need to find the last letter.

We can try ""steak"" because K is a common letter.

But we must avoid letters that are already ruled out: K is not in the ruled out list (which is C, R, N, L). So K is okay.

Similarly, M and D are okay.

We might try ""steak"" as a guess.

But note: we are allowed to make multiple guesses? We have 6 tries.

Alternatively, we could make a guess that tests several possibilities? But that might be inefficient because we have so many letters fixed.

Let me think: We have the pattern STEA_. We have to put a letter in the last spot.

We can try one of the possibilities.

But note: we have no information about K, M, or D. So we just need to choose one.

Let me prioritize by common words.

""Steak"" and ""steam"" are both very common. ""Stead"" is less common.

So between ""steak"" and ""steam"", I'll pick ""steak"" because I'm thinking of food. But that's arbitrary.

Alternatively, we can look for which one avoids repeating letters? But all letters are already in the word? The word will have S, T, E, A, and one more. We don't think there are duplicates because we haven't seen any duplicate feedback.

In guess2, we had S,T,E,A,L and only L was absent, so no duplicates.

Similarly in guess1, no duplicates.

So probably no duplicate letters.

So let's try ""steak"".

If ""steak"" is correct, we win. If not, then we know it is either ""steam"" or ""stead"", and we can try next.

But note: we have only 6 tries and we are on guess 3, so we can risk.

Let's guess ""steak"".

So the guess is ""steak"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: Letters **C, R, N** are not in the secret word. Letters **A** and **E** are in the word but not in positions 3 or 5, respectively.
- **Guess 2 (""steal"")**: Letters **S, T, E, A** are correct and in positions 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Letter **L** is not in the word.

### Deductions:
- The secret word starts with **""STEA""** (positions 1-4 confirmed).
- The last letter (position 5) is unknown and must form a valid English word.
- The last letter cannot be **L** (ruled out by ""steal"") or **C, R, N** (ruled out by ""crane"").

### Possible Words:
The last letter must complete a 5-letter word starting with ""STEA"". Common options include:
- **steak** (with K)
- **steam** (with M)
- **stead** (with D)

### Thought Process for Next Guess:
- With four letters confirmed, the goal is to test the last unknown letter.
- ""steak"" is a common word and tests the letter **K**. This maximizes efficiency since we might solve in one guess.
- If incorrect, we eliminate **K** and narrow to other candidates (e.g., ""steam"" or ""stead"") for subsequent guesses.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters A and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"". 
   Specifically, A was in position 3 and E in position 5 of ""crane"", so in the secret word, A is not at position 3 and E is not at position 5.
 - The letters C, R, and N are not in the word at all.

 We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
 - Includes A and E (since they are present in the secret word) but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively.
 - Does not include C, R, or N.

 Also, we have 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.

 Let's think of a word that uses common letters and avoids C, R, N.

 We know the word has A and E. We can try to place A and E in new positions.

 Since A was in position 3 and now must be elsewhere, we can try A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
 Similarly, E was in position 5 and now must be elsewhere, so we can try E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 However, we also want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Common consonants (besides C, R, N which are out) are: S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.

 Let's try to form a word that includes A and E, and also some of these common consonants.

 We also note that we have two letters that are present (A and E) and three that are absent (C, R, N). So we have 3 new letters to test.

 Possible strategy: use a word that has A and E in new positions and three new letters.

 Example: 
   Position 1: new letter (say S)
   Position 2: A (since A was not at 3, we try 2)
   Position 3: new letter (say T)
   Position 4: new letter (say L)
   Position 5: E (but wait, E was at position 5 in the first guess and was marked as present but wrong position? Actually, the feedback for E was '-' meaning it is in the word but not at position 5. So we cannot put E at position 5 again? Actually, we can, because the feedback only said it's not at position 5, but it might be at position 5 in a different word? No, the same word? The secret word is fixed. The feedback for the first guess: E was at position 5 and was marked as '-' meaning that in the secret word, E is present but not at position 5. Therefore, in the next guess, we should avoid putting E at position 5. Similarly, A should not be at position 3.

 However, note: the feedback does not prevent us from putting E at position 5 again? But that would be a waste because we know it's not there. So we should put E in a different position.

 But wait: the feedback says that E is in the word but not at position 5. So we must put E in one of positions 1,2,3,4.

 Similarly, A must be in one of positions 1,2,4,5 (but note: in the first guess, A was at position 3, so we avoid 3).

 However, we have two letters A and E to place. We must also include them.

 Let me try to form a word:

 Option: ""SALET"" is a common word in word games, but let's check:
   S at 1, A at 2, L at 3, E at 4, T at 5.

 But note: we must avoid putting A at position 3? Actually, in this word, A is at position 2, which is allowed. And E is at position 4, which is not 5 so allowed.

 However, we also know that the secret word does not have C, R, N. So ""SALET"" uses S, A, L, E, T. None of C, R, N. So it's okay.

 But wait: what about the letter L? We don't know if L is in the word. Similarly, S and T.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has the letter E in a different position and A in a different position, and also tests other vowels? But we know the word has A and E, so we don't need to test other vowels necessarily.

 However, we don't know if there are more letters. We only know two letters so far.

 Another idea: we can try to use a word that has both A and E and also includes other common letters that we haven't tested, such as S, T, L, D, etc.

 Let me list some words that have A and E and avoid C, R, N:

 - slate: S, L, A, T, E -> positions: A at 3? But we must avoid A at position 3? Because in the first guess, A was at position 3 and was marked as present but wrong position. So in the secret word, A is not at position 3. Therefore, in ""slate"", if we put A at position 3, that would be the same position as before? And we know it's not there. So we should avoid that.

 How about ""steal"": 
   S, T, E, A, L -> 
   position 1: S
   position 2: T
   position 3: E (this is a new position for E, since E was at 5 before)
   position 4: A (this is a new position for A, since A was at 3 before)
   position 5: L

 This seems good: 
   E is at 3 (not 5) and A is at 4 (not 3). 

 But note: we are not sure if E can be at 3? The feedback only said E is in the word but not at 5. It could be at 3.

 Similarly, A is at 4, which is not 3.

 Also, the word ""steal"" uses S, T, E, A, L. We haven't ruled out S, T, L.

 Another option: ""least"" -> 
   L, E, A, S, T -> 
   E at 2 (not 5) and A at 3 -> but wait, we cannot put A at 3 because we know A is not at position 3 in the secret word. So ""least"" is invalid for A at position 3.

 How about ""tales"":
   T, A, L, E, S -> 
   A at 2 (okay, not 3) and E at 4 (okay, not 5).

 So ""tales"" is acceptable.

 But note: we want to maximize information. We have two known letters (A and E) and we are testing three new ones (T, L, S). 

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't repeat the positions of A and E and also uses common letters.

 Another common word: ""adieu"" but that has D, I, U and we don't know about them, but also it has A and E. However, we have two vowels already and we might get less information about consonants.

 Since we have two vowels (A and E) already, we might focus on consonants.

 I think ""steal"" or ""tales"" are good.

 But let me check: in ""steal"", we have:
   S, T, E, A, L

 We are testing S, T, L and also confirming A and E in new positions.

 However, note that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

 I'll go with ""steal"".

 But wait: the feedback for the first guess had A and E as present. So the word must have at least one A and one E.

 In ""steal"", we have one A and one E.

 So, let's guess ""steal"".

 However, note: we must make sure that ""steal"" is a valid word. Yes, it is.

 Therefore, my next guess is ""steal"".

<guess>steal</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, N** are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **A** is in the word but **not in position 3** (marked ""-"").
- **E** is in the word but **not in position 5** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** and **E** (since they are in the secret word), but **A cannot be in position 3** and **E cannot be in position 5**.
- Must **avoid C, R, N** entirely.
- Aim to test new common letters (e.g., **S, T, L**) to gather more information.

The word **""STEAL""** fits these criteria:
- Places **A in position 4** (new position, avoiding 3).
- Places **E in position 3** (new position, avoiding 5).
- Tests new letters: **S, T, L**.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, N).

This maximizes information while adhering to the feedback.

<guess>steal</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: steal -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) E(✓) A(✓) L(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
   - This means: C, R, N are not in the word at all.
   - A is in the word but not at position 3.
   - E is in the word but not at position 5.

2. ""steal"" -> S(✓) T(✓) E(✓) A(✓) L(x)
   - This means: S is correct at position 1, T is correct at position 2, E is correct at position 3, A is correct at position 4, and L is not in the word.

From guess 2, we know:
- The secret word has S at position 1, T at position 2, E at position 3, and A at position 4.
- So the secret word so far is: S, T, E, A, ?

Additionally, L is not in the word (marked x).

Also, from guess 1, we know:
- C, R, N are not in the word.
- And we already used E and A, and now we know their positions.

So the secret word is: [S][T][E][A][?]

We need to find the last letter.

The last letter must be a letter that is not C, R, N (from guess1) and not L (from guess2). Also, it must form a valid English word.

We must avoid: C, R, N, L.

What are possible letters for the last position?

The word is ""STEA?"" and must be a valid 5-letter word.

Let's think of words that start with ""STEA"":

- steak (K is a possible letter)
- steam (M is a possible letter)
- steal (but we guessed steal and L is not in the word, and also we have L marked x so it cannot be steal)
- stead (D is a possible letter)
- steak (K) is another

But note: our secret word cannot have the last letter as L because we already got L as x.

Also, from guess1, we know E is in the word but not at position 5? It was at position 5 in ""crane"", but now we have it at position 3. So that's consistent.

The letters we have ruled out: C, R, N, L.

Also, note that in guess1 we had A at position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. Now we have A at position 4 and it's correct. This is consistent because the position changed.

Similarly, E was at position 5 in guess1 and now at position 3.

So the last letter must be a consonant (since it's the last letter of a word) and must form a word.

Possible words:

- steak (with K)
- steam (with M)
- stead (with D)

Are there others? Probably not common ones.

Now, we need to guess one. Since we have 6 tries and we are on guess 3, we can try to guess one of these.

But note: we don't have any feedback on other letters. We need to confirm.

Since we already have four letters correctly placed, we just need to find the last letter.

We can try ""steak"" because K is a common letter.

But we must avoid letters that are already ruled out: K is not in the ruled out list (which is C, R, N, L). So K is okay.

Similarly, M and D are okay.

We might try ""steak"" as a guess.

But note: we are allowed to make multiple guesses? We have 6 tries.

Alternatively, we could make a guess that tests several possibilities? But that might be inefficient because we have so many letters fixed.

Let me think: We have the pattern STEA_. We have to put a letter in the last spot.

We can try one of the possibilities.

But note: we have no information about K, M, or D. So we just need to choose one.

Let me prioritize by common words.

""Steak"" and ""steam"" are both very common. ""Stead"" is less common.

So between ""steak"" and ""steam"", I'll pick ""steak"" because I'm thinking of food. But that's arbitrary.

Alternatively, we can look for which one avoids repeating letters? But all letters are already in the word? The word will have S, T, E, A, and one more. We don't think there are duplicates because we haven't seen any duplicate feedback.

In guess2, we had S,T,E,A,L and only L was absent, so no duplicates.

Similarly in guess1, no duplicates.

So probably no duplicate letters.

So let's try ""steak"".

If ""steak"" is correct, we win. If not, then we know it is either ""steam"" or ""stead"", and we can try next.

But note: we have only 6 tries and we are on guess 3, so we can risk.

Let's guess ""steak"".

So the guess is ""steak"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: Letters **C, R, N** are not in the secret word. Letters **A** and **E** are in the word but not in positions 3 or 5, respectively.
- **Guess 2 (""steal"")**: Letters **S, T, E, A** are correct and in positions 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Letter **L** is not in the word.

### Deductions:
- The secret word starts with **""STEA""** (positions 1-4 confirmed).
- The last letter (position 5) is unknown and must form a valid English word.
- The last letter cannot be **L** (ruled out by ""steal"") or **C, R, N** (ruled out by ""crane"").

### Possible Words:
The last letter must complete a 5-letter word starting with ""STEA"". Common options include:
- **steak** (with K)
- **steam** (with M)
- **stead** (with D)

### Thought Process for Next Guess:
- With four letters confirmed, the goal is to test the last unknown letter.
- ""steak"" is a common word and tests the letter **K**. This maximizes efficiency since we might solve in one guess.
- If incorrect, we eliminate **K** and narrow to other candidates (e.g., ""steam"" or ""stead"") for subsequent guesses.

  - Positions 1–4 are **S, T, E, A**.
  - Position 5 is **unknown**.
- Eliminated letters: **C, R, N, L, K** (all marked ""x"").
- Position 5 **cannot be** C, R, N, L, or K.
- Valid candidates for position 5 must form a real English word. Possible options:
  - **steam** (M)  
  - **stead** (D)  
  - Others like ""stear"" (R eliminated) or ""stean"" (N eliminated) are invalid.

### Next Guess Strategy:
- Goal: Test the most common candidate for position 5.
- **""steam""** tests **M**—a high-frequency letter not yet tested.  
- If incorrect, **""stead""** can be guessed next (final candidate).

We can try to place A and E in new positions.\n\n Since A was in position 3 and now must be elsewhere, we can try A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n Similarly, E was in position 5 and now must be elsewhere, so we can try E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n However, we also want to test other common letters to get more information.\n\n Common consonants (besides C, R, N which are out) are: S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word that includes A and E, and also some of these common consonants.\n\n We also note that we have two letters that are present (A and E) and three that are absent (C, R, N). So we have 3 new letters to test.\n\n Possible strategy: use a word that has A and E in new positions and three new letters.\n\n Example: \n   Position 1: new letter (say S)\n   Position 2: A (since A was not at 3, we try 2)\n   Position 3: new letter (say T)\n   Position 4: new letter (say L)\n   Position 5: E (but wait, E was at position 5 in the first guess and was marked as present but wrong position? Actually, the feedback for E was \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not at position 5. So we cannot put E at position 5 again? Actually, we can, because the feedback only said it\'s not at position 5, but it might be at position 5 in a different word? No, the same word? The secret word is fixed. The feedback for the first guess: E was at position 5 and was marked as \'-\' meaning that in the secret word, E is present but not at position 5. Therefore, in the next guess, we should avoid putting E at position 5. Similarly, A should not be at position 3.\n\n However, note: the feedback does not prevent us from putting E at position 5 again? But that would be a waste because we know it\'s not there. So we should put E in a different position.\n\n But wait: the feedback says that E is in the word but not at position 5. So we must put E in one of positions 1,2,3,4.\n\n Similarly, A must be in one of positions 1,2,4,5 (but note: in the first guess, A was at position 3, so we avoid 3).\n\n However, we have two letters A and E to place. We must also include them.\n\n Let me try to form a word:\n\n Option: ""SALET"" is a common word in word games, but let\'s check:\n   S at 1, A at 2, L at 3, E at 4, T at 5.\n\n But note: we must avoid putting A at position 3? Actually, in this word, A is at position 2, which is allowed. And E is at position 4, which is not 5 so allowed.\n\n However, we also know that the secret word does not have C, R, N. So ""SALET"" uses S, A, L, E, T. None of C, R, N. So it\'s okay.\n\n But wait: what about the letter L? We don\'t know if L is in the word. Similarly, S and T.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has the letter E in a different position and A in a different position, and also tests other vowels? But we know the word has A and E, so we don\'t need to test other vowels necessarily.\n\n However, we don\'t know if there are more letters. We only know two letters so far.\n\n Another idea: we can try to use a word that has both A and E and also includes other common letters that we haven\'t tested, such as S, T, L, D, etc.\n\n Let me list some words that have A and E and avoid C, R, N:\n\n - slate: S, L, A, T, E -> positions: A at 3? But we must avoid A at position 3? Because in the first guess, A was at position 3 and was marked as present but wrong position. So in the secret word, A is not at position 3. Therefore, in ""slate"", if we put A at position 3, that would be the same position as before? And we know it\'s not there. So we should avoid that.\n\n How about ""steal"": \n   S, T, E, A, L -> \n   position 1: S\n   position 2: T\n   position 3: E (this is a new position for E, since E was at 5 before)\n   position 4: A (this is a new position for A, since A was at 3 before)\n   position 5: L\n\n This seems good: \n   E is at 3 (not 5) and A is at 4 (not 3). \n\n But note: we are not sure if E can be at 3? The feedback only said E is in the word but not at 5. It could be at 3.\n\n Similarly, A is at 4, which is not 3.\n\n Also, the word ""steal"" uses S, T, E, A, L. We haven\'t ruled out S, T, L.\n\n Another option: ""least"" -> \n   L, E, A, S, T -> \n   E at 2 (not 5) and A at 3 -> but wait, we cannot put A at 3 because we know A is not at position 3 in the secret word. So ""least"" is invalid for A at position 3.\n\n How about ""tales"":\n   T, A, L, E, S -> \n   A at 2 (okay, not 3) and E at 4 (okay, not 5).\n\n So ""tales"" is acceptable.\n\n But note: we want to maximize information. We have two known letters (A and E) and we are testing three new ones (T, L, S). \n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t repeat the positions of A and E and also uses common letters.\n\n Another common word: ""adieu"" but that has D, I, U and we don\'t know about them, but also it has A and E. However, we have two vowels already and we might get less information about consonants.\n\n Since we have two vowels (A and E) already, we might focus on consonants.\n\n I think ""steal"" or ""tales"" are good.\n\n But let me check: in ""steal"", we have:\n   S, T, E, A, L\n\n We are testing S, T, L and also confirming A and E in new positions.\n\n However, note that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have any indication of duplicates so far.\n\n I\'ll go with ""steal"".\n\n But wait: the feedback for the first guess had A and E as present. So the word must have at least one A and one E.\n\n In ""steal"", we have one A and one E.\n\n So, let\'s guess ""steal"".\n\n However, note: we must make sure that ""steal"" is a valid word. Yes, it is.\n\n Therefore, my next guess is ""steal"".\n\n<guess>steal</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C, R, N** are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- **A** is in the word but **not in position 3** (marked ""-"").\n- **E** is in the word but **not in position 5** (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **A** and **E** (since they are in the secret word), but **A cannot be in position 3** and **E cannot be in position 5**.\n- Must **avoid C, R, N** entirely.\n- Aim to test new common letters (e.g., **S, T, L**) to gather more information.\n\nThe word **""STEAL""** fits these criteria:\n- Places **A in position 4** (new position, avoiding 3).\n- Places **E in position 3** (new position, avoiding 5).\n- Tests new letters: **S, T, L**.\n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, N).\n\nThis maximizes information while adhering to the feedback.\n\n<guess>steal</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: steal -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) E(✓) A(✓) L(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n1.

It was at position 5 in ""crane"", but now we have it at position 3. So that\'s consistent.\n\nThe letters we have ruled out: C, R, N, L.\n\nAlso, note that in guess1 we had A at position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. Now we have A at position 4 and it\'s correct. This is consistent because the position changed.\n\nSimilarly, E was at position 5 in guess1 and now at position 3.\n\nSo the last letter must be a consonant (since it\'s the last letter of a word) and must form a word.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- steak (with K)\n- steam (with M)\n- stead (with D)\n\nAre there others? Probably not common ones.\n\nNow, we need to guess one. Since we have 6 tries and we are on guess 3, we can try to guess one of these.\n\nBut note: we don\'t have any feedback on other letters. We need to confirm.\n\nSince we already have four letters correctly placed, we just need to find the last letter.\n\nWe can try ""steak"" because K is a common letter.\n\nBut we must avoid letters that are already ruled out: K is not in the ruled out list (which is C, R, N, L). So K is okay.\n\nSimilarly, M and D are okay.\n\nWe might try ""steak"" as a guess.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to make multiple guesses? We have 6 tries.\n\nAlternatively, we could make a guess that tests several possibilities? But that might be inefficient because we have so many letters fixed.\n\nLet me think: We have the pattern STEA_. We have to put a letter in the last spot.\n\nWe can try one of the possibilities.\n\nBut note: we have no information about K, M, or D. So we just need to choose one.\n\nLet me prioritize by common words.\n\n""Steak"" and ""steam"" are both very common. ""Stead"" is less common.\n\nSo between ""steak"" and ""steam"", I\'ll pick ""steak"" because I\'m thinking of food. But that\'s arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, we can look for which one avoids repeating letters? But all letters are already in the word? The word will have S, T, E, A, and one more. We don\'t think there are duplicates because we haven\'t seen any duplicate feedback.\n\nIn guess2, we had S,T,E,A,L and only L was absent, so no duplicates.\n\nSimilarly in guess1, no duplicates.\n\nSo probably no duplicate letters.\n\nSo let\'s try ""steak"".\n\nIf ""steak"" is correct, we win. If not, then we know it is either ""steam"" or ""stead"", and we can try next.\n\nBut note: we have only 6 tries and we are on guess 3, so we can risk.\n\nLet\'s guess ""steak"".\n\nSo the guess is ""steak"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: Letters **C, R, N** are not in the secret word. Letters **A** and **E** are in the word but not in positions 3 or 5, respectively.\n- **Guess 2 (""steal"")**: Letters **S, T, E, A** are correct and in positions 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.

  - S, T, E, A are in the correct positions (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th).

Guess 4: ""steam"" → S(✓), T(✓), E(✓), A(✓), M(x)

- stead (D) remains.

Less common words:
- ""stear"" (but R is out, from guess1)
- ""stean"" (N is out)

So the only common word left is ""stead"".

But let me confirm: is ""stead"" a valid word? Yes, meaning a place or position.

Therefore, the secret word must be ""STEAD"".

We have one more candidate: ""steal"" is out because L is not in the word. Similarly, others are out.

So we should guess ""stead"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**:  
  - **C, R, N** → not in the word (x).  
  - **A** → in word but wrong position (not position 3) (-).  
  - **E** → in word but wrong position (not position 5) (-).  
- **Guess 2 (""steal"")**:  
  - **S, T, E, A** → correct positions (✓) (positions 1–4 confirmed).  
  - **L** → not in the word (x).  
- **Guess 3 (""steak"")**:  
  - **S, T, E, A** → correct positions (✓) (reaffirmed).  
  - **K** → not in the word (x).  
- **Guess 4 (""steam"")**:  
  - **S, T, E, A** → correct positions (✓) (reaffirmed).  
  - **M** → not in the word (x).  

### Key Deductions:
- The secret word is **S T E A _** (positions 1–4 are fixed).  
- Position 5 must be a letter that:  
  - Forms a valid English word.  
  - Is **not C, R, N** (from Guess 1).  
  - Is **not L, K, or M** (from Guesses 2–4).  
- Eliminated letters for position 5: **C, R, N, L, K, M**.  

### Remaining Possibilities:
- **""stead""** (with **D**) is the **only common English word** fitting the pattern and constraints:  
  - ""STEAD"" is valid (meaning ""a place or location"").  
  - **D** has not been tested yet and is not eliminated.  
- Other theoretical options (e.g., ""stear"", ""stean"") are invalid (use eliminated letters R/N).  

### Next Guess:
- **""stead""** is the definitive candidate. If correct, it solves the puzzle.

  - **E** → in word but wrong position (not position 5) (-).  
- **Guess 2 (""steal"")**:  
  - **S, T, E, A** → correct positions (✓) (positions 1–4 confirmed).  
  - **L** → not in the word (x).  
- **Guess 3 (""steak"")**:  
  - **S, T, E, A** → correct positions (✓) (reaffirmed).  
  - **K** → not in the word (x).  
- **Guess 4 (""steam"")**:  
  - **S, T, E, A** → correct positions (✓) (reaffirmed).  
  - **M** → not in the word (x).  

### Key Deductions:
- The secret word is **S T E A _** (positions 1–4 are fixed).  
- Position 5 must be a letter that:  
  - Forms a valid English word.  
  - Is **not C, R, N** (from Guess 1).  
  - Is **not L, K, or M** (from Guesses 2–4).  
- Eliminated letters for position 5: **C, R, N, L, K, M**.  

### Remaining Possibilities:
- **""stead""** (with **D**) is the **only common English word** fitting the pattern and constraints:  
  - ""STEAD"" is valid (meaning ""a place or location"").  
  - **D** has not been tested yet and is not eliminated.  
- Other theoretical options (e.g., ""stear"", ""stean"") are invalid (use eliminated letters R/N).  

### Next Guess:
- **""stead""** is the definitive candidate. If correct, it solves the puzzle.",Guess 5: stead -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) E(✓) A(✓) D(✓),SUCCESS
