We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" as it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). Also, it doesn't repeat letters.

 So, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": all letters are marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, we must avoid using any of these letters in our next guess.

 Since none of the letters in ""crane"" are in the secret word, we need to choose a word that uses entirely different letters.

 We should pick a word that uses other common letters to maximize the chance of hitting some in the secret word.

 Common letters in English 5-letter words (excluding C, R, A, N, E) might include: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, H, G, B, etc.

 A good second guess might be ""SLOTH"" or ""PIOUS"", but let's think of a word that uses as many common letters as possible without repeating and without using the excluded letters.

 Another popular starting word is ""SLATE"", but it uses A and E which are excluded. So we cannot use that.

 We can try ""MOIST"" or ""BUILD"", but let's list some words without C, R, A, N, E.

 Possible words: 
   - ""SLIMY"": uses S, L, I, M, Y -> but Y is less common at the end.
   - ""PLUMB"": but B is at the end and it's not very common, and also has a silent B.
   - ""LIGHT"": uses L, I, G, H, T -> common letters.

 However, we want to cover more common letters. Let's consider:

   - ""TOILS"": uses T, O, I, L, S -> all common.

 But we can do better. How about ""OUIJA""? That's not common and has a J which is rare.

 Another idea: ""PIOUS"" uses P, I, O, U, S. But U is less common.

 Alternatively, ""SHIFT"": uses S, H, I, F, T. F is somewhat common.

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Let me think of a word that uses T, O, S, L, I. But we can't use all in one word because it's 5 letters.

 The word ""SLIPT"" is not common. ""SPILT"" is a word: S, P, I, L, T.

 However, we can use ""SPLIT"": S, P, L, I, T. That's a good word.

 But wait, we have to avoid the letters C, R, A, N, E. ""SPLIT"" does not contain any of these.

 So, I choose ""SPLIT"" as the next guess.

After the first guess ""crane"" received all ""x"" feedback, we know the secret word contains none of the letters: C, R, A, N, or E. For the next guess, we need a word that uses entirely new letters to maximize information. Common English letters not yet tested include S, T, L, I, P, O, U, M, D, G, B, H, Y, etc. 

A strong second guess should:
- Use high-frequency letters to increase hit probability
- Avoid repeating excluded letters (C, R, A, N, E)
- Cover new vowel/consonant combinations

""**PIOUS**"" fits well:
- Contains P, I, O, U, S – all common letters not previously used
- Tests two vowels (I, O, U) and three consonants
- Is a valid 5-letter word

This choice efficiently probes new letter combinations while adhering to the feedback constraints.

We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters wrong: C, R, A, N, E are not in the secret word.
2. ""split"" -> all letters wrong: S, P, L, I, T are not in the secret word.

So now we know that the secret word does not contain any of these letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, L, I, T.

We need to choose a new word that avoids all these letters and uses new letters.

Available letters: We've excluded 10 letters. The English alphabet has 26 letters, so we have 16 letters left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should choose a word that uses common letters from these remaining ones to maximize the chance of hitting the secret word.

Common letters among the remaining: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, U, V, W, Y. Letters like J, Q, X, Z are less common.

We aim for a word that uses as many common letters as possible without repeating and without using excluded letters.

Some possible words:

- ""MOUND"" but we excluded D? Let's check: D is still available.
  Actually, we haven't excluded D. Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,L,I,T. So D is available.

Potential words:
- ""MOLDY"" but L is excluded and O is available? Wait, we excluded L? Yes, from ""split"", L is excluded. So cannot use L.

Let's list available letters again: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, let's think of words using these letters.

Common combinations: 
- Words like ""FUDGY"" but F, U, D, G, Y? But we need valid 5-letter words.
- ""GOUGE"" uses G, O, U, G, E? But E is excluded. So no.
- ""HUMOR"" but H, U, M, O, R? But R is excluded? R was excluded from ""crane"", so cannot use R.

We have to be cautious.

Another idea: ""BUGGY"" but has double G? And Y. But let's think of words without repeated letters.

Better: ""MOUND"" - M, O, U, N, D? But N is excluded? From ""crane"", N is excluded. So no.

We need to avoid: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,L,I,T.

So word? How about ""JUMBO""? J, U, M, B, O. All available? 
- J is less common, but available.
- U: available
- M: available
- B: available
- O: available

But ""JUMBO"" is a valid word? Yes, it means large, like in jumbo jet.

Another possibility: ""FUDGY"" has D, G, Y, and F, U. But D, F, G are available? Yes.

But let's see common letters: We want to cover vowels too? O and U are vowels available.

A better choice might be a word with O and U, plus consonants like B, D, F, G, H, K, M.

Try ""FOUGH"" or ""MIGHT""? But we don't have G,H. How about ""HUMOR""? H, U, M, O, R? But R is excluded.

Cannot use R.

What about ""BOUGH"": B, O, U, G, H. All letters available? 
- B: yes
- O: yes
- U: yes
- G: yes
- H: yes
And ""BOUGH"" is a word meaning a tree branch.

Another: ""DOUGH"" D, O, U, G, H? D is available, so yes.

But we might want more common consonants? How common is D? Pretty common.

But note: Both ""JUMBO"" and ""BOUGH"" use common letters. ""JUMBO"" has M and B, which are good.

Alternatively, ""MUCKY""? M, U, C, K, Y? C is excluded? Yes, C is from ""crane"", excluded. So no.

""BUGGY"" has G and Y, but repeated G? Not ideal.

Best option: ""JUMBO"" uses J,U,M,B,O. While J is less common, the others are good. But perhaps we can avoid J.

Let me try to find a word without J.

""WOUND"" but W, O, U, N, D? N is excluded? From ""crane"", N is excluded. So no.

""YOUTH""? Y, O, U, T, H? T is excluded? From ""split"", T is excluded. So no.

""CHILD"" but C and H? C excluded. No.

We need to stick to letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Consider ""FOAMY""? F, O, A, M, Y? A is excluded. No.

""FOGGY""? F, O, G, G, Y? Repeated G? Not great.

""MOUTH""? M, O, U, T, H? T excluded? Yes, from ""split"". So no.

""VOUCH""? V, O, U, C, H? C excluded? Yes.

""QUOTH""? Q, U, O, T, H? T excluded? Yes.

So perhaps ""JUMBO"" is acceptable? But J is rare. Alternatively, ""BODYWORK"" not 5 letters.

Another word: ""GUMBO"" G, U, M, B, O? But ""GUMBO"" is a word?! Let me check: Yes, gumbo is a stew. And letters: G,U,M,B,O. All available? 
- G: yes
- U: yes
- M: yes
- B: yes
- O: yes

Perfect! And it avoids J, which is less common.

So ""GUMBO"" is better than ""JUMBO"" because it uses G instead of J.

Therefore, I choose ""GUMBO"".

We might get hits on some of these letters.

After two guesses with all letters incorrect, the excluded letters are: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, L, I, T. The secret word must consist of letters from the remaining 16: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. 

For the third guess, ""gumbo"" is chosen because:
- It uses common letters G, U, M, B, O (avoiding rare letters like J, Q, X, Z).
- It tests new vowels (O, U) and consonants (G, M, B).
- It maximizes information potential by covering high-frequency combinations.

<guess>gumbo</guess>",gumbo,"We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters wrong: C, R, A, N, E are not in the secret word.
2. ""split"" -> all letters wrong: S, P, L, I, T are not in the secret word.

So now we know that the secret word does not contain any of these letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, L, I, T.

We need to choose a new word that avoids all these letters and uses new letters.

Available letters: We've excluded 10 letters. The English alphabet has 26 letters, so we have 16 letters left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should choose a word that uses common letters from these remaining ones to maximize the chance of hitting the secret word.

Common letters among the remaining: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, U, V, W, Y. Letters like J, Q, X, Z are less common.

We aim for a word that uses as many common letters as possible without repeating and without using excluded letters.

Some possible words:

- ""MOUND"" but we excluded D? Let's check: D is still available.
  Actually, we haven't excluded D. Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,L,I,T. So D is available.

Potential words:
- ""MOLDY"" but L is excluded and O is available? Wait, we excluded L? Yes, from ""split"", L is excluded. So cannot use L.

Let's list available letters again: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, let's think of words using these letters.

Common combinations: 
- Words like ""FUDGY"" but F, U, D, G, Y? But we need valid 5-letter words.
- ""GOUGE"" uses G, O, U, G, E? But E is excluded. So no.
- ""HUMOR"" but H, U, M, O, R? But R is excluded? R was excluded from ""crane"", so cannot use R.

We have to be cautious.

Another idea: ""BUGGY"" but has double G? And Y. But let's think of words without repeated letters.

Better: ""MOUND"" - M, O, U, N, D? But N is excluded? From ""crane"", N is excluded. So no.

We need to avoid: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,L,I,T.

So word? How about ""JUMBO""? J, U, M, B, O. All available? 
- J is less common, but available.
- U: available
- M: available
- B: available
- O: available

But ""JUMBO"" is a valid word? Yes, it means large, like in jumbo jet.

Another possibility: ""FUDGY"" has D, G, Y, and F, U. But D, F, G are available? Yes.

But let's see common letters: We want to cover vowels too? O and U are vowels available.

A better choice might be a word with O and U, plus consonants like B, D, F, G, H, K, M.

Try ""FOUGH"" or ""MIGHT""? But we don't have G,H. How about ""HUMOR""? H, U, M, O, R? But R is excluded.

Cannot use R.

What about ""BOUGH"": B, O, U, G, H. All letters available? 
- B: yes
- O: yes
- U: yes
- G: yes
- H: yes
And ""BOUGH"" is a word meaning a tree branch.

Another: ""DOUGH"" D, O, U, G, H? D is available, so yes.

But we might want more common consonants? How common is D? Pretty common.

But note: Both ""JUMBO"" and ""BOUGH"" use common letters. ""JUMBO"" has M and B, which are good.

Alternatively, ""MUCKY""? M, U, C, K, Y? C is excluded? Yes, C is from ""crane"", excluded. So no.

""BUGGY"" has G and Y, but repeated G? Not ideal.

Best option: ""JUMBO"" uses J,U,M,B,O. While J is less common, the others are good. But perhaps we can avoid J.

Let me try to find a word without J.

""WOUND"" but W, O, U, N, D? N is excluded? From ""crane"", N is excluded. So no.

""YOUTH""? Y, O, U, T, H? T is excluded? From ""split"", T is excluded. So no.

""CHILD"" but C and H? C excluded. No.

We need to stick to letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Consider ""FOAMY""? F, O, A, M, Y? A is excluded. No.

""FOGGY""? F, O, G, G, Y? Repeated G? Not great.

""MOUTH""? M, O, U, T, H? T excluded? Yes, from ""split"". So no.

""VOUCH""? V, O, U, C, H? C excluded? Yes.

""QUOTH""? Q, U, O, T, H? T excluded? Yes.

So perhaps ""JUMBO"" is acceptable? But J is rare. Alternatively, ""BODYWORK"" not 5 letters.

Another word: ""GUMBO"" G, U, M, B, O? But ""GUMBO"" is a word?! Let me check: Yes, gumbo is a stew. And letters: G,U,M,B,O. All available? 
- G: yes
- U: yes
- M: yes
- B: yes
- O: yes

Perfect! And it avoids J, which is less common.

So ""GUMBO"" is better than ""JUMBO"" because it uses G instead of J.

Therefore, I choose ""GUMBO"".

We might get hits on some of these letters.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" as it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). Also, it doesn't repeat letters.

 So, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": all letters are marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, we must avoid using any of these letters in our next guess.

 Since none of the letters in ""crane"" are in the secret word, we need to choose a word that uses entirely different letters.

 We should pick a word that uses other common letters to maximize the chance of hitting some in the secret word.

 Common letters in English 5-letter words (excluding C, R, A, N, E) might include: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, H, G, B, etc.

 A good second guess might be ""SLOTH"" or ""PIOUS"", but let's think of a word that uses as many common letters as possible without repeating and without using the excluded letters.

 Another popular starting word is ""SLATE"", but it uses A and E which are excluded. So we cannot use that.

 We can try ""MOIST"" or ""BUILD"", but let's list some words without C, R, A, N, E.

 Possible words: 
   - ""SLIMY"": uses S, L, I, M, Y -> but Y is less common at the end.
   - ""PLUMB"": but B is at the end and it's not very common, and also has a silent B.
   - ""LIGHT"": uses L, I, G, H, T -> common letters.

 However, we want to cover more common letters. Let's consider:

   - ""TOILS"": uses T, O, I, L, S -> all common.

 But we can do better. How about ""OUIJA""? That's not common and has a J which is rare.

 Another idea: ""PIOUS"" uses P, I, O, U, S. But U is less common.

 Alternatively, ""SHIFT"": uses S, H, I, F, T. F is somewhat common.

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Let me think of a word that uses T, O, S, L, I. But we can't use all in one word because it's 5 letters.

 The word ""SLIPT"" is not common. ""SPILT"" is a word: S, P, I, L, T.

 However, we can use ""SPLIT"": S, P, L, I, T. That's a good word.

 But wait, we have to avoid the letters C, R, A, N, E. ""SPLIT"" does not contain any of these.

 So, I choose ""SPLIT"" as the next guess.

<guess>split</guess>After the first guess ""crane"" received all ""x"" feedback, we know the secret word contains none of the letters: C, R, A, N, or E. For the next guess, we need a word that uses entirely new letters to maximize information. Common English letters not yet tested include S, T, L, I, P, O, U, M, D, G, B, H, Y, etc. 

A strong second guess should:
- Use high-frequency letters to increase hit probability
- Avoid repeating excluded letters (C, R, A, N, E)
- Cover new vowel/consonant combinations

""**PIOUS**"" fits well:
- Contains P, I, O, U, S – all common letters not previously used
- Tests two vowels (I, O, U) and three consonants
- Is a valid 5-letter word

This choice efficiently probes new letter combinations while adhering to the feedback constraints.

<guess>split</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

So now we know that the secret word does not contain any of these letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, L, I, T.

We need to choose a new word that avoids all these letters and uses new letters.

Available letters: We've excluded 10 letters. The English alphabet has 26 letters, so we have 16 letters left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should choose a word that uses common letters from these remaining ones to maximize the chance of hitting the secret word.

Common letters among the remaining: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, U, V, W, Y. Letters like J, Q, X, Z are less common.

Let's list available letters again: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, let's think of words using these letters.

Common combinations: 
- Words like ""FUDGY"" but F, U, D, G, Y? But we need valid 5-letter words.
- ""GOUGE"" uses G, O, U, G, E? But E is excluded. So no.
- ""HUMOR"" but H, U, M, O, R? But R is excluded? R was excluded from ""crane"", so cannot use R.

We have to be cautious.

Another idea: ""BUGGY"" but has double G? And Y. But let's think of words without repeated letters.

Better: ""MOUND"" - M, O, U, N, D? But N is excluded? From ""crane"", N is excluded. So no.

We need to avoid: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,L,I,T.

So word? How about ""JUMBO""? J, U, M, B, O. All available? 
- J is less common, but available.
- U: available
- M: available
- B: available
- O: available

But ""JUMBO"" is a valid word? Yes, it means large, like in jumbo jet.

Another possibility: ""FUDGY"" has D, G, Y, and F, U. But D, F, G are available? Yes.

But let's see common letters: We want to cover vowels too? O and U are vowels available.

- G: yes
- H: yes
And ""BOUGH"" is a word meaning a tree branch.

Another: ""DOUGH"" D, O, U, G, H? D is available, so yes.

But we might want more common consonants? How common is D? Pretty common.

But note: Both ""JUMBO"" and ""BOUGH"" use common letters. ""JUMBO"" has M and B, which are good.

Alternatively, ""MUCKY""? M, U, C, K, Y? C is excluded? Yes, C is from ""crane"", excluded. So no.

""BUGGY"" has G and Y, but repeated G? Not ideal.

Best option: ""JUMBO"" uses J,U,M,B,O. While J is less common, the others are good. But perhaps we can avoid J.

""WOUND"" but W, O, U, N, D? N is excluded? From ""crane"", N is excluded. So no.

""YOUTH""? Y, O, U, T, H? T is excluded? From ""split"", T is excluded. So no.

""CHILD"" but C and H? C excluded. No.

We need to stick to letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Consider ""FOAMY""? F, O, A, M, Y? A is excluded. No.

""FOGGY""? F, O, G, G, Y? Repeated G? Not great.

""MOUTH""? M, O, U, T, H? T excluded? Yes, from ""split"". So no.

""VOUCH""? V, O, U, C, H? C excluded? Yes.

""QUOTH""? Q, U, O, T, H? T excluded? Yes.

So perhaps ""JUMBO"" is acceptable? But J is rare. Alternatively, ""BODYWORK"" not 5 letters.

Another word: ""GUMBO"" G, U, M, B, O? But ""GUMBO"" is a word?! Let me check: Yes, gumbo is a stew. And letters: G,U,M,B,O. All available? 
- G: yes
- U: yes
- M: yes
- B: yes
- O: yes

Perfect! And it avoids J, which is less common.

So ""GUMBO"" is better than ""JUMBO"" because it uses G instead of J.

Therefore, I choose ""GUMBO"".

We might get hits on some of these letters.

The secret word must consist of letters from the remaining 16: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. \n\nFor the third guess, ""gumbo"" is chosen because:\n- It uses common letters G, U, M, B, O (avoiding rare letters like J, Q, X, Z).\n- It tests new vowels (O, U) and consonants (G, M, B).\n- It maximizes information potential by covering high-frequency combinations.\n\n<guess>gumbo</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: split -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) L(x) I(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: gumbo -> FEEDBACK: G(x) U(x) M(x) B(x) O(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters wrong: excluded C, R, A, N, E.
2. ""split"" -> all letters wrong: excluded S, P, L, I, T.
3. ""gumbo"" -> feedback: G(x), U(x), M(x), B(x), O(-)

So, O is present in the secret word but not at the last position (since in ""gumbo"", O is the fifth letter, and it's marked as '-', meaning present but wrong position).

Now, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter O, but not as the fifth letter.
- Excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,L,I,T,G,U,M,B.
- Since O is in the word, we must keep O in our next guess, but not at the end.

We need to consider the available letters: the English alphabet without excluded letters.

Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,L,I,T,G,U,M,B -> 14 letters excluded.

Available: D, F, H, J, K, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (12 letters). But note: O is included and must be used.

But O is included and must be present in the word, and we know O is not the last letter.

Now, we have 12 available letters: D, F, H, J, K, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a 5-letter word using these letters, and it must include O (but not at position 5).

Since O is the only vowel left? Wait, we have U excluded? Yes, U is excluded from ""gumbo"". So no other vowels? Unless we consider Y as vowel.

Available vowels: O and Y (if Y can be used as vowel), and sometimes W? But typically, we need vowels. So O is confirmed, then Y might be used as vowel.

But with such constrained letters, finding a word might be challenging.

List of possible words:

We have 12 letters: D,F,H,J,K,O,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Possible words that include O and are 5 letters:

- ""JOKED"": but E is excluded? E is from ""crane"", excluded. So no.

- ""FOXED"": but F,O,X,E,D? E excluded? Yes, cannot use E. Also, we haven't excluded D? D is still available? In the available list I have D.

Remember we excluded: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,L,I,T,G,U,M,B.

So D, F, H, J, K, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z are available.

But ""FOXED"" uses F,O,X,E,D? E is excluded? Yes, E is excluded. So invalid.

- ""HOOKY"": H,O,O,K,Y? But repeated O? And not a big issue, but we should avoid repeats if possible? However, it's allowed. Let me check: ""HOOKY"" is a word (meaning truant). But note, O is repeated, but that's okay.

In ""HOOKY"", O is at positions 2 and 3. We know O is not at the 5th position, which is okay since the last letter of ""HOOKY"" is Y.

But the feedback from ""gumbo"" only told us that O is in the word but not at 5th position. It doesn't tell us how many times O appears. It could appear multiple times.

But in our guess, we want to test new letters.

Which letters have not been excluded? From the 12 available.

Now, ""HOOKY"" uses H, O, O, K, Y. So letters: H,O,K,Y (and O repeated). We are testing H,K,Y, and O (again).

But O is for position, so that might be okay.

Another idea: ""FJORD""? F,J,O,R,D? But R is excluded? R is from ""crane"", excluded. So no.

""VODKA"": V,O,D,K,A? A is excluded? From ""crane"", A is excluded. So no.

""WOKEN"": W,O,K,E,N? E and N excluded? Both excluded. No.

""YOUTH"": Y,O,U,T,H? U and T excluded? Yes, from previous. U from ""gumbo"", T from ""split"".

So ""YOUTH"" uses U and T which are excluded? Invalid.

""WHOOP"": W,H,O,O,P? P excluded? From ""split"", P is excluded. So no.

""KOJOU""? ""KOJOU"" not common.

What about ""JOWLY"": J,O,W,L,Y? L excluded? From ""split"", L is excluded. So no.

""YOWED"": Y,O,W,E,D? E excluded? Yes.

""OZZY""? Only 4 letters.

This is difficult. Let me think of words with O and available consonants.

How about ""DOXIV""? Not a word.

""HOMME""? Not English, and has M, which is excluded? M excluded from ""gumbo"". Wait, M is excluded? Yes.

Another idea: ""DOZHY""? Not a word.

Perhaps we must use Y as vowel.

Consider: ""JOLLY""? But L excluded? L from ""split"" excluded.

So how about ""JO"" with something? Not.

""FOYER"": F,O,Y,E,R? E and R excluded? Both excluded. No.

This is hard. Maybe ""BOXED"": but E excluded? ""BOXED"" has E? No, ""BOXED"": B,O,X,E,D? But B is excluded from ""gumbo"", and E is excluded. Double exclusion.

But let's list words from available letters: D,F,H,J,K,O,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Possible words:
- ""HOYDEN"": but 6 letters? We need 5 letters.

5 letter words:

- ""DORKY""? D,O,R,K,Y? R excluded? Yes.

- ""FORKY""? F,O,R,K,Y? R excluded.

- ""HOKEY"": H,O,K,E,Y? E excluded? Yes.

- ""JOKEY"": J,O,K,E,Y? E excluded.

- ""KHOTY""? Not word.

- ""VOZHD""? Not word.

- ""WOOZY"": W,O,O,Z,Y? Has double O? But allowed. Let me check if it's valid: ""WOOZY"" is a word (meaning dizzy). Letters: W, O, O, Z, Y.

Available? W: yes, O: yes, Z: yes, Y: yes. And does not use any excluded letters? Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,L,I,T,G,U,M,B. None of W,O,Z,Y in excluded? Correct.

So ""WOOZY"" is a candidate.

But note: O is at positions 2 and 3? And not at 5? The last letter is Y, so O is not at position 5? Correct. We know O must be present, so we include it. The word ends with Y.

Now, this tests W, O, O, Z, Y. So new letters: W, Z, Y. And we know O is tested again? But we are also testing positions.

Another possibility? ""DOBBY""? But B and D? But B is excluded? From ""gumbo"", B is excluded. And ""DOBBY"" has B? No, ""DOBBY"" uses B, which is excluded.

How about ""DOOZY""? Similar? ""DOOZY"" has Z? Let me check: ""DOOZY"" is a word. Letters: D, O, O, Z, Y? Available: D, O, Z, Y? Yes. We can use D.

But compared to ""WOOZY"", both are possible? ""DOOZY"" uses D instead of W.

Which letters are more common? In English, D is more common than W? So testing D is good? But W is also common.

Another option? ""FOODY""? F,O,O,D,Y? But F, O, D, Y available? Yes. Is ""FOODY"" a word? It might be informal? Or food-related? Probably accepted.

But ""WOOZY"" seems standard.

Alternatively, ""ZOBO"": only 4 letters.

""OOZED"": O,O,Z,E,D? E excluded? Yes.

So ""WOOZY"" or ""DOOZY"".

Let me check ""DOOZY"": it is a valid word meaning something excellent. And ""WOOZY"" meaning dizzy.

Both fine.

But note: in ""gumbo"", O was in position 5 and found not to be there? Now in ""WOOZY"", we put O at positions 2 and 3, not 1 or 4 or 5? Position 5 is Y, so okay.

But we might want to test different positions? For example, put O at the beginning? But we don't know.

In ""WOOZY"", O is at positions 2 and 3? That might be okay.

Another word: ""JOCKY""? J,O,C,K,Y? C excluded? Yes.

Not.

""ZOWIE"": Z,O,W,I,E? I and E excluded? Yes.

No.

So perhaps ""WOOZY"" is fine.

But we have Q available? ""OQUET""? Not a word.

""TOQUE""? T excluded? Yes.

So best bet is ""WOOZY"" or ""DOOZY"".

I think ""WOOZY"" is a reasonable choice.

But let's think: we might want to avoid double letters? But Wordle allows double letters, and the feedback will tell.

Note: we have to include O, and from available letters, it's hard.

Another word: ""BOXTY""? B and T excluded? B excluded, T excluded.

""HYDRO""? H,Y,D,R,O? R excluded.

No.

Therefore, I think ""WOOZY"" is acceptable.

So I choose ""WOOZY"".

We have to remember that the word must contain O, so ""WOOZY"" has O.

If we guess ""WOOZY"", and if O is in the word, it will show as '-' for O if in wrong position, or '✓' if correct.

But in this case, we know O is in the word, but we don't know positions.

The goal is to get more information.

Alternatively, we can try ""HOOKY""? But H,O,O,K,Y? K and Y available? Yes. ""HOOKY"" is valid.

But ""HOOKY"" uses H,K,Y, while ""WOOZY"" uses W,Z,Y? So different.

Both test letters we haven't tried.

But W and Z versus H and K? H and K are more common? Actually, W, H, K, Y, Z: all are not very high frequency but we have limited choices.

I think ""HOOKY"" might be better because it doesn't have Z, which is less common? But Z is possible.

Or we can choose ""HOOKY"" to preserve letters like D,Z for later.

But I think it's fine.

Let's go with ""WOOZY"" for now.

But note: we only have 12 available letters, and we must use O. So testing multiple O's is okay if the word has repeats.

So guess: ""WOOZY""

After analyzing the feedback:
- **Guess 1 (""crane""):** All letters incorrect → C, R, A, N, E excluded.
- **Guess 2 (""split""):** All letters incorrect → S, P, L, I, T excluded.
- **Guess 3 (""gumbo""):** G, U, M, B incorrect → excluded. O present but in wrong position → O must appear in the secret word, but not at the fifth position.

**Excluded letters (14 total):** C, R, A, N, E, S, P, L, I, T, G, U, M, B.  
**Available letters (12 total):** D, F, H, J, K, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
**Key constraint:** O must be in the word (not at position 5).

For the next guess:
- Must include O to verify its position.
- Avoid excluded letters; prioritize common consonants like D, F, H, K, W, Y, and Z where possible.
- Words are scarce due to limited vowel options (O is the only common vowel available; Y may act as a vowel).
- ""WOOZY"" (meaning dizzy) is valid:
  - Contains O (required) and avoids position 5.
  - Tests new letters: W, Z, Y.
  - Double O is acceptable—can reveal if O appears multiple times in the secret word.
  - Other options like ""DOOZY"" or ""HOOKY"" were considered, but ""WOOZY"" balances letter coverage and commonality.

This guess maximizes positional information for O and probes several high-likelihood consonants.

<guess>woozy</guess>",woozy,"We have feedback from three guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters wrong: excluded C, R, A, N, E.
2. ""split"" -> all letters wrong: excluded S, P, L, I, T.

So, O is present in the secret word but not at the last position (since in ""gumbo"", O is the fifth letter, and it's marked as '-', meaning present but wrong position).

Now, we know:

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

 We should pick a word that uses other common letters to maximize the chance of hitting some in the secret word.

 Common letters in English 5-letter words (excluding C, R, A, N, E) might include: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, H, G, B, etc.

 A good second guess might be ""SLOTH"" or ""PIOUS"", but let's think of a word that uses as many common letters as possible without repeating and without using the excluded letters.

 Another popular starting word is ""SLATE"", but it uses A and E which are excluded. So we cannot use that.

 We can try ""MOIST"" or ""BUILD"", but let's list some words without C, R, A, N, E.

 Possible words: 
   - ""SLIMY"": uses S, L, I, M, Y -> but Y is less common at the end.
   - ""PLUMB"": but B is at the end and it's not very common, and also has a silent B.
   - ""LIGHT"": uses L, I, G, H, T -> common letters.

 However, we want to cover more common letters. Let's consider:

   - ""TOILS"": uses T, O, I, L, S -> all common.

 But we can do better. How about ""OUIJA""? That's not common and has a J which is rare.

 Another idea: ""PIOUS"" uses P, I, O, U, S. But U is less common.

 Alternatively, ""SHIFT"": uses S, H, I, F, T. F is somewhat common.

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Let me think of a word that uses T, O, S, L, I. But we can't use all in one word because it's 5 letters.

 The word ""SLIPT"" is not common. ""SPILT"" is a word: S, P, I, L, T.

 However, we can use ""SPLIT"": S, P, L, I, T. That's a good word.

 But wait, we have to avoid the letters C, R, A, N, E. ""SPLIT"" does not contain any of these.

 So, I choose ""SPLIT"" as the next guess.

<guess>split</guess>After the first guess ""crane"" received all ""x"" feedback, we know the secret word contains none of the letters: C, R, A, N, or E. For the next guess, we need a word that uses entirely new letters to maximize information. Common English letters not yet tested include S, T, L, I, P, O, U, M, D, G, B, H, Y, etc. 

A strong second guess should:
- Use high-frequency letters to increase hit probability
- Avoid repeating excluded letters (C, R, A, N, E)
- Cover new vowel/consonant combinations

""**PIOUS**"" fits well:
- Contains P, I, O, U, S – all common letters not previously used
- Tests two vowels (I, O, U) and three consonants
- Is a valid 5-letter word

This choice efficiently probes new letter combinations while adhering to the feedback constraints.

<guess>split</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: split -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) L(x) I(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters wrong: C, R, A, N, E are not in the secret word.
2. ""split"" -> all letters wrong: S, P, L, I, T are not in the secret word.

So now we know that the secret word does not contain any of these letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, L, I, T.

We need to choose a new word that avoids all these letters and uses new letters.

Available letters: We've excluded 10 letters. The English alphabet has 26 letters, so we have 16 letters left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should choose a word that uses common letters from these remaining ones to maximize the chance of hitting the secret word.

Common letters among the remaining: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, U, V, W, Y. Letters like J, Q, X, Z are less common.

We aim for a word that uses as many common letters as possible without repeating and without using excluded letters.

Some possible words:

- ""MOUND"" but we excluded D? Let's check: D is still available.
  Actually, we haven't excluded D. Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,L,I,T. So D is available.

Potential words:
- ""MOLDY"" but L is excluded and O is available? Wait, we excluded L? Yes, from ""split"", L is excluded. So cannot use L.

Let's list available letters again: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, let's think of words using these letters.

Common combinations: 
- Words like ""FUDGY"" but F, U, D, G, Y? But we need valid 5-letter words.
- ""GOUGE"" uses G, O, U, G, E? But E is excluded. So no.
- ""HUMOR"" but H, U, M, O, R? But R is excluded? R was excluded from ""crane"", so cannot use R.

We have to be cautious.

Another idea: ""BUGGY"" but has double G? And Y. But let's think of words without repeated letters.

Better: ""MOUND"" - M, O, U, N, D? But N is excluded? From ""crane"", N is excluded. So no.

We need to avoid: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,L,I,T.

So word? How about ""JUMBO""? J, U, M, B, O. All available? 
- J is less common, but available.
- U: available
- M: available
- B: available
- O: available

But ""JUMBO"" is a valid word? Yes, it means large, like in jumbo jet.

Another possibility: ""FUDGY"" has D, G, Y, and F, U. But D, F, G are available? Yes.

But let's see common letters: We want to cover vowels too? O and U are vowels available.

A better choice might be a word with O and U, plus consonants like B, D, F, G, H, K, M.

Try ""FOUGH"" or ""MIGHT""? But we don't have G,H. How about ""HUMOR""? H, U, M, O, R? But R is excluded.

Cannot use R.

What about ""BOUGH"": B, O, U, G, H. All letters available? 
- B: yes
- O: yes
- U: yes
- G: yes
- H: yes
And ""BOUGH"" is a word meaning a tree branch.

Another: ""DOUGH"" D, O, U, G, H? D is available, so yes.

But we might want more common consonants? How common is D? Pretty common.

But note: Both ""JUMBO"" and ""BOUGH"" use common letters. ""JUMBO"" has M and B, which are good.

Alternatively, ""MUCKY""? M, U, C, K, Y? C is excluded? Yes, C is from ""crane"", excluded. So no.

""BUGGY"" has G and Y, but repeated G? Not ideal.

Best option: ""JUMBO"" uses J,U,M,B,O. While J is less common, the others are good. But perhaps we can avoid J.

Let me try to find a word without J.

""WOUND"" but W, O, U, N, D? N is excluded? From ""crane"", N is excluded. So no.

""YOUTH""? Y, O, U, T, H? T is excluded? From ""split"", T is excluded. So no.

""CHILD"" but C and H? C excluded. No.

We need to stick to letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Consider ""FOAMY""? F, O, A, M, Y? A is excluded. No.

""FOGGY""? F, O, G, G, Y? Repeated G? Not great.

""MOUTH""? M, O, U, T, H? T excluded? Yes, from ""split"". So no.

""VOUCH""? V, O, U, C, H? C excluded? Yes.

""QUOTH""? Q, U, O, T, H? T excluded? Yes.

So perhaps ""JUMBO"" is acceptable? But J is rare. Alternatively, ""BODYWORK"" not 5 letters.

Another word: ""GUMBO"" G, U, M, B, O? But ""GUMBO"" is a word?! Let me check: Yes, gumbo is a stew. And letters: G,U,M,B,O. All available? 
- G: yes
- U: yes
- M: yes
- B: yes
- O: yes

Perfect! And it avoids J, which is less common.

So ""GUMBO"" is better than ""JUMBO"" because it uses G instead of J.

Therefore, I choose ""GUMBO"".

We might get hits on some of these letters.

<guess>gumbo</guess>After two guesses with all letters incorrect, the excluded letters are: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, L, I, T. The secret word must consist of letters from the remaining 16: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. 

For the third guess, ""gumbo"" is chosen because:
- It uses common letters G, U, M, B, O (avoiding rare letters like J, Q, X, Z).
- It tests new vowels (O, U) and consonants (G, M, B).
- It maximizes information potential by covering high-frequency combinations.

<guess>gumbo</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: split -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) L(x) I(x) T(x)
Guess 3: gumbo -> FEEDBACK: G(x) U(x) M(x) B(x) O(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from three guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters wrong: excluded C, R, A, N, E.
2. ""split"" -> all letters wrong: excluded S, P, L, I, T.
3. ""gumbo"" -> feedback: G(x), U(x), M(x), B(x), O(-)

So, O is present in the secret word but not at the last position (since in ""gumbo"", O is the fifth letter, and it's marked as '-', meaning present but wrong position).

Now, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter O, but not as the fifth letter.
- Excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,L,I,T,G,U,M,B.
- Since O is in the word, we must keep O in our next guess, but not at the end.

We need to consider the available letters: the English alphabet without excluded letters.

Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,L,I,T,G,U,M,B -> 14 letters excluded.

Available: D, F, H, J, K, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (12 letters). But note: O is included and must be used.

But O is included and must be present in the word, and we know O is not the last letter.

Now, we have 12 available letters: D, F, H, J, K, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a 5-letter word using these letters, and it must include O (but not at position 5).

Since O is the only vowel left? Wait, we have U excluded? Yes, U is excluded from ""gumbo"". So no other vowels? Unless we consider Y as vowel.

Available vowels: O and Y (if Y can be used as vowel), and sometimes W? But typically, we need vowels. So O is confirmed, then Y might be used as vowel.

But with such constrained letters, finding a word might be challenging.

List of possible words:

We have 12 letters: D,F,H,J,K,O,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Possible words that include O and are 5 letters:

- ""JOKED"": but E is excluded? E is from ""crane"", excluded. So no.

- ""FOXED"": but F,O,X,E,D? E excluded? Yes, cannot use E. Also, we haven't excluded D? D is still available? In the available list I have D.

Remember we excluded: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,L,I,T,G,U,M,B.

So D, F, H, J, K, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z are available.

But ""FOXED"" uses F,O,X,E,D? E is excluded? Yes, E is excluded. So invalid.

- ""HOOKY"": H,O,O,K,Y? But repeated O? And not a big issue, but we should avoid repeats if possible? However, it's allowed. Let me check: ""HOOKY"" is a word (meaning truant). But note, O is repeated, but that's okay.

In ""HOOKY"", O is at positions 2 and 3. We know O is not at the 5th position, which is okay since the last letter of ""HOOKY"" is Y.

But the feedback from ""gumbo"" only told us that O is in the word but not at 5th position. It doesn't tell us how many times O appears. It could appear multiple times.

But in our guess, we want to test new letters.

Which letters have not been excluded? From the 12 available.

Now, ""HOOKY"" uses H, O, O, K, Y. So letters: H,O,K,Y (and O repeated). We are testing H,K,Y, and O (again).

But O is for position, so that might be okay.

Another idea: ""FJORD""? F,J,O,R,D? But R is excluded? R is from ""crane"", excluded. So no.

""VODKA"": V,O,D,K,A? A is excluded? From ""crane"", A is excluded. So no.

""WOKEN"": W,O,K,E,N? E and N excluded? Both excluded. No.

""YOUTH"": Y,O,U,T,H? U and T excluded? Yes, from previous. U from ""gumbo"", T from ""split"".

So ""YOUTH"" uses U and T which are excluded? Invalid.

""WHOOP"": W,H,O,O,P? P excluded? From ""split"", P is excluded. So no.

""KOJOU""? ""KOJOU"" not common.

What about ""JOWLY"": J,O,W,L,Y? L excluded? From ""split"", L is excluded. So no.

""YOWED"": Y,O,W,E,D? E excluded? Yes.

""OZZY""? Only 4 letters.

This is difficult. Let me think of words with O and available consonants.

How about ""DOXIV""? Not a word.

""HOMME""? Not English, and has M, which is excluded? M excluded from ""gumbo"". Wait, M is excluded? Yes.

Another idea: ""DOZHY""? Not a word.

Perhaps we must use Y as vowel.

Consider: ""JOLLY""? But L excluded? L from ""split"" excluded.

So how about ""JO"" with something? Not.

""FOYER"": F,O,Y,E,R? E and R excluded? Both excluded. No.

This is hard. Maybe ""BOXED"": but E excluded? ""BOXED"" has E? No, ""BOXED"": B,O,X,E,D? But B is excluded from ""gumbo"", and E is excluded. Double exclusion.

But let's list words from available letters: D,F,H,J,K,O,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Possible words:
- ""HOYDEN"": but 6 letters? We need 5 letters.

5 letter words:

- ""DORKY""? D,O,R,K,Y? R excluded? Yes.

- ""FORKY""? F,O,R,K,Y? R excluded.

- ""HOKEY"": H,O,K,E,Y? E excluded? Yes.

- ""JOKEY"": J,O,K,E,Y? E excluded.

- ""KHOTY""? Not word.

- ""VOZHD""? Not word.

- ""WOOZY"": W,O,O,Z,Y? Has double O? But allowed. Let me check if it's valid: ""WOOZY"" is a word (meaning dizzy). Letters: W, O, O, Z, Y.

Available? W: yes, O: yes, Z: yes, Y: yes. And does not use any excluded letters? Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,L,I,T,G,U,M,B. None of W,O,Z,Y in excluded? Correct.

So ""WOOZY"" is a candidate.

But note: O is at positions 2 and 3? And not at 5? The last letter is Y, so O is not at position 5? Correct. We know O must be present, so we include it. The word ends with Y.

Now, this tests W, O, O, Z, Y. So new letters: W, Z, Y. And we know O is tested again? But we are also testing positions.

Another possibility? ""DOBBY""? But B and D? But B is excluded? From ""gumbo"", B is excluded. And ""DOBBY"" has B? No, ""DOBBY"" uses B, which is excluded.

How about ""DOOZY""? Similar? ""DOOZY"" has Z? Let me check: ""DOOZY"" is a word. Letters: D, O, O, Z, Y? Available: D, O, Z, Y? Yes. We can use D.

But compared to ""WOOZY"", both are possible? ""DOOZY"" uses D instead of W.

Which letters are more common? In English, D is more common than W? So testing D is good? But W is also common.

Another option? ""FOODY""? F,O,O,D,Y? But F, O, D, Y available? Yes. Is ""FOODY"" a word? It might be informal? Or food-related? Probably accepted.

But ""WOOZY"" seems standard.

Alternatively, ""ZOBO"": only 4 letters.

""OOZED"": O,O,Z,E,D? E excluded? Yes.

So ""WOOZY"" or ""DOOZY"".

Let me check ""DOOZY"": it is a valid word meaning something excellent. And ""WOOZY"" meaning dizzy.

Both fine.

But note: in ""gumbo"", O was in position 5 and found not to be there? Now in ""WOOZY"", we put O at positions 2 and 3, not 1 or 4 or 5? Position 5 is Y, so okay.

But we might want to test different positions? For example, put O at the beginning? But we don't know.

In ""WOOZY"", O is at positions 2 and 3? That might be okay.

Another word: ""JOCKY""? J,O,C,K,Y? C excluded? Yes.

Not.

""ZOWIE"": Z,O,W,I,E? I and E excluded? Yes.

No.

So perhaps ""WOOZY"" is fine.

But we have Q available? ""OQUET""? Not a word.

""TOQUE""? T excluded? Yes.

So best bet is ""WOOZY"" or ""DOOZY"".

I think ""WOOZY"" is a reasonable choice.

But let's think: we might want to avoid double letters? But Wordle allows double letters, and the feedback will tell.

Note: we have to include O, and from available letters, it's hard.

Another word: ""BOXTY""? B and T excluded? B excluded, T excluded.

""HYDRO""? H,Y,D,R,O? R excluded.

No.

Therefore, I think ""WOOZY"" is acceptable.

So I choose ""WOOZY"".

We have to remember that the word must contain O, so ""WOOZY"" has O.

If we guess ""WOOZY"", and if O is in the word, it will show as '-' for O if in wrong position, or '✓' if correct.

But in this case, we know O is in the word, but we don't know positions.

The goal is to get more information.

Alternatively, we can try ""HOOKY""? But H,O,O,K,Y? K and Y available? Yes. ""HOOKY"" is valid.

But ""HOOKY"" uses H,K,Y, while ""WOOZY"" uses W,Z,Y? So different.

Both test letters we haven't tried.

But W and Z versus H and K? H and K are more common? Actually, W, H, K, Y, Z: all are not very high frequency but we have limited choices.

I think ""HOOKY"" might be better because it doesn't have Z, which is less common? But Z is possible.

Or we can choose ""HOOKY"" to preserve letters like D,Z for later.

But I think it's fine.

Let's go with ""WOOZY"" for now.

But note: we only have 12 available letters, and we must use O. So testing multiple O's is okay if the word has repeats.

So guess: ""WOOZY""

<guess>woozy</guess>After analyzing the feedback:
- **Guess 1 (""crane""):** All letters incorrect → C, R, A, N, E excluded.
- **Guess 2 (""split""):** All letters incorrect → S, P, L, I, T excluded.
- **Guess 3 (""gumbo""):** G, U, M, B incorrect → excluded. O present but in wrong position → O must appear in the secret word, but not at the fifth position.

**Excluded letters (14 total):** C, R, A, N, E, S, P, L, I, T, G, U, M, B.  
**Available letters (12 total):** D, F, H, J, K, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
**Key constraint:** O must be in the word (not at position 5).

For the next guess:
- Must include O to verify its position.
- Avoid excluded letters; prioritize common consonants like D, F, H, K, W, Y, and Z where possible.
- Words are scarce due to limited vowel options (O is the only common vowel available; Y may act as a vowel).
- ""WOOZY"" (meaning dizzy) is valid:
  - Contains O (required) and avoids position 5.
  - Tests new letters: W, Z, Y.
  - Double O is acceptable—can reveal if O appears multiple times in the secret word.
  - Other options like ""DOOZY"" or ""HOOKY"" were considered, but ""WOOZY"" balances letter coverage and commonality.

This guess maximizes positional information for O and probes several high-likelihood consonants.

But we need valid 5-letter words.\n- ""GOUGE"" uses G, O, U, G, E? But E is excluded. So no.\n- ""HUMOR"" but H, U, M, O, R? But R is excluded? R was excluded from ""crane"", so cannot use R.\n\nWe have to be cautious.\n\nAnother idea: ""BUGGY"" but has double G? And Y. But let\'s think of words without repeated letters.\n\nBetter: ""MOUND"" - M, O, U, N, D? But N is excluded? From ""crane"", N is excluded. So no.\n\nWe need to avoid: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,L,I,T.\n\nSo word? How about ""JUMBO""? J, U, M, B, O. All available? \n- J is less common, but available.\n- U: available\n- M: available\n- B: available\n- O: available\n\nBut ""JUMBO"" is a valid word? Yes, it means large, like in jumbo jet.\n\nAnother possibility: ""FUDGY"" has D, G, Y, and F, U. But D, F, G are available? Yes.\n\nBut let\'s see common letters: We want to cover vowels too? O and U are vowels available.\n\nA better choice might be a word with O and U, plus consonants like B, D, F, G, H, K, M.\n\nTry ""FOUGH"" or ""MIGHT""? But we don\'t have G,H. How about ""HUMOR""? H, U, M, O, R? But R is excluded.\n\nCannot use R.\n\nWhat about ""BOUGH"": B, O, U, G, H. All letters available? \n- B: yes\n- O: yes\n- U: yes\n- G: yes\n- H: yes\nAnd ""BOUGH"" is a word meaning a tree branch.\n\nAnother: ""DOUGH"" D, O, U, G, H? D is available, so yes.\n\nBut we might want more common consonants? How common is D? Pretty common.\n\nBut note: Both ""JUMBO"" and ""BOUGH"" use common letters. ""JUMBO"" has M and B, which are good.\n\nAlternatively, ""MUCKY""? M, U, C, K, Y? C is excluded? Yes, C is from ""crane"", excluded. So no.\n\n""BUGGY"" has G and Y, but repeated G? Not ideal.\n\nBest option: ""JUMBO"" uses J,U,M,B,O. While J is less common, the others are good. But perhaps we can avoid J.\n\nLet me try to find a word without J.\n\n""WOUND"" but W, O, U, N, D? N is excluded? From ""crane"", N is excluded. So no.\n\n""YOUTH""? Y, O, U, T, H? T is excluded? From ""split"", T is excluded. So no.\n\n""CHILD"" but C and H? C excluded. No.\n\nWe need to stick to letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nConsider ""FOAMY""? F, O, A, M, Y? A is excluded. No.\n\n""FOGGY""? F, O, G, G, Y? Repeated G? Not great.\n\n""MOUTH""? M, O, U, T, H? T excluded? Yes, from ""split"". So no.\n\n""VOUCH""? V, O, U, C, H? C excluded? Yes.\n\n""QUOTH""? Q, U, O, T, H? T excluded? Yes.\n\nSo perhaps ""JUMBO"" is acceptable? But J is rare. Alternatively, ""BODYWORK"" not 5 letters.\n\nAnother word: ""GUMBO"" G, U, M, B, O? But ""GUMBO"" is a word?! Let me check: Yes, gumbo is a stew. And letters: G,U,M,B,O. All available? \n- G: yes\n- U: yes\n- M: yes\n- B: yes\n- O: yes\n\nPerfect! And it avoids J, which is less common.\n\nSo ""GUMBO"" is better than ""JUMBO"" because it uses G instead of J.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""GUMBO"".\n\nWe might get hits on some of these letters.\n\n<guess>gumbo</guess>After two guesses with all letters incorrect, the excluded letters are: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, L, I, T. The secret word must consist of letters from the remaining 16: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. \n\nFor the third guess, ""gumbo"" is chosen because:\n- It uses common letters G, U, M, B, O (avoiding rare letters like J, Q, X, Z).\n- It tests new vowels (O, U) and consonants (G, M, B).\n- It maximizes information potential by covering high-frequency combinations.\n\n<guess>gumbo</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: split -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) L(x) I(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: gumbo -> FEEDBACK: G(x) U(x) M(x) B(x) O(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n1.

""gumbo"" -> feedback: G(x), U(x), M(x), B(x), O(-)\n\nSo, O is present in the secret word but not at the last position (since in ""gumbo"", O is the fifth letter, and it\'s marked as \'-\', meaning present but wrong position).\n\nNow, we know:\n- The secret word contains the letter O, but not as the fifth letter.\n- Excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,L,I,T,G,U,M,B.\n- Since O is in the word, we must keep O in our next guess, but not at the end.\n\nWe need to consider the available letters: the English alphabet without excluded letters.\n\nExcluded: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,L,I,T,G,U,M,B -> 14 letters excluded.\n\nAvailable: D, F, H, J, K, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (12 letters). But note: O is included and must be used.\n\nBut O is included and must be present in the word, and we know O is not the last letter.\n\nNow, we have 12 available letters: D, F, H, J, K, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word using these letters, and it must include O (but not at position 5).\n\nSince O is the only vowel left? Wait, we have U excluded? Yes, U is excluded from ""gumbo"". So no other vowels? Unless we consider Y as vowel.\n\nAvailable vowels: O and Y (if Y can be used as vowel), and sometimes W? But typically, we need vowels. So O is confirmed, then Y might be used as vowel.\n\nBut with such constrained letters, finding a word might be challenging.\n\nList of possible words:\n\nWe have 12 letters: D,F,H,J,K,O,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nPossible words that include O and are 5 letters:\n\n- ""JOKED"": but E is excluded? E is from ""crane"", excluded. So no.\n\n- ""FOXED"": but F,O,X,E,D? E excluded? Yes, cannot use E. Also, we haven\'t excluded D? D is still available? In the available list I have D.\n\nRemember we excluded: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,L,I,T,G,U,M,B.\n\nSo D, F, H, J, K, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z are available.\n\nBut ""FOXED"" uses F,O,X,E,D? E is excluded? Yes, E is excluded. So invalid.\n\n- ""HOOKY"": H,O,O,K,Y? But repeated O? And not a big issue, but we should avoid repeats if possible? However, it\'s allowed. Let me check: ""HOOKY"" is a word (meaning truant). But note, O is repeated, but that\'s okay.\n\nIn ""HOOKY"", O is at positions 2 and 3. We know O is not at the 5th position, which is okay since the last letter of ""HOOKY"" is Y.\n\nBut the feedback from ""gumbo"" only told us that O is in the word but not at 5th position. It doesn\'t tell us how many times O appears. It could appear multiple times.\n\nBut in our guess, we want to test new letters.\n\nWhich letters have not been excluded? From the 12 available.\n\nNow, ""HOOKY"" uses H, O, O, K, Y. So letters: H,O,K,Y (and O repeated). We are testing H,K,Y, and O (again).\n\nBut O is for position, so that might be okay.\n\nAnother idea: ""FJORD""? F,J,O,R,D? But R is excluded? R is from ""crane"", excluded. So no.\n\n""VODKA"": V,O,D,K,A? A is excluded? From ""crane"", A is excluded. So no.\n\n""WOKEN"": W,O,K,E,N? E and N excluded? Both excluded. No.\n\n""YOUTH"": Y,O,U,T,H? U and T excluded? Yes, from previous. U from ""gumbo"", T from ""split"".\n\nSo ""YOUTH"" uses U and T which are excluded? Invalid.\n\n""WHOOP"": W,H,O,O,P? P excluded? From ""split"", P is excluded. So no.\n\n""KOJOU""? ""KOJOU"" not common.\n\nWhat about ""JOWLY"": J,O,W,L,Y? L excluded? From ""split"", L is excluded. So no.\n\n""YOWED"": Y,O,W,E,D? E excluded? Yes.\n\n""OZZY""? Only 4 letters.\n\nThis is difficult. Let me think of words with O and available consonants.\n\nHow about ""DOXIV""? Not a word.\n\n""HOMME""? Not English, and has M, which is excluded? M excluded from ""gumbo"". Wait, M is excluded? Yes.\n\nAnother idea: ""DOZHY""? Not a word.\n\nPerhaps we must use Y as vowel.\n\nConsider: ""JOLLY""? But L excluded? L from ""split"" excluded.\n\nSo how about ""JO"" with something? Not.\n\n""FOYER"": F,O,Y,E,R? E and R excluded? Both excluded. No.\n\nThis is hard. Maybe ""BOXED"": but E excluded? ""BOXED"" has E? No, ""BOXED"": B,O,X,E,D? But B is excluded from ""gumbo"", and E is excluded. Double exclusion.\n\nBut let\'s list words from available letters: D,F,H,J,K,O,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""HOYDEN"": but 6 letters? We need 5 letters.\n\n5 letter words:\n\n- ""DORKY""? D,O,R,K,Y? R excluded? Yes.\n\n- ""FORKY""? F,O,R,K,Y? R excluded.\n\n- ""HOKEY"": H,O,K,E,Y? E excluded? Yes.\n\n- ""JOKEY"": J,O,K,E,Y? E excluded.\n\n- ""KHOTY""? Not word.\n\n- ""VOZHD""? Not word.\n\n- ""WOOZY"": W,O,O,Z,Y? Has double O? But allowed. Let me check if it\'s valid: ""WOOZY"" is a word (meaning dizzy). Letters: W, O, O, Z, Y.\n\nAvailable? W: yes, O: yes, Z: yes, Y: yes. And does not use any excluded letters? Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,L,I,T,G,U,M,B. None of W,O,Z,Y in excluded? Correct.\n\nSo ""WOOZY"" is a candidate.\n\nBut note: O is at positions 2 and 3? And not at 5? The last letter is Y, so O is not at position 5? Correct. We know O must be present, so we include it. The word ends with Y.\n\nNow, this tests W, O, O, Z, Y. So new letters: W, Z, Y. And we know O is tested again? But we are also testing positions.\n\nAnother possibility? ""DOBBY""? But B and D? But B is excluded? From ""gumbo"", B is excluded. And ""DOBBY"" has B? No, ""DOBBY"" uses B, which is excluded.\n\nHow about ""DOOZY""? Similar? ""DOOZY"" has Z? Let me check: ""DOOZY"" is a word. Letters: D, O, O, Z, Y? Available: D, O, Z, Y? Yes. We can use D.\n\nBut compared to ""WOOZY"", both are possible? ""DOOZY"" uses D instead of W.\n\nWhich letters are more common? In English, D is more common than W? So testing D is good? But W is also common.\n\nAnother option? ""FOODY""? F,O,O,D,Y? But F, O, D, Y available? Yes. Is ""FOODY"" a word? It might be informal? Or food-related? Probably accepted.\n\nBut ""WOOZY"" seems standard.\n\nAlternatively, ""ZOBO"": only 4 letters.\n\n""OOZED"": O,O,Z,E,D? E excluded? Yes.\n\nSo ""WOOZY"" or ""DOOZY"".\n\nLet me check ""DOOZY"": it is a valid word meaning something excellent. And ""WOOZY"" meaning dizzy.\n\nBoth fine.\n\nBut note: in ""gumbo"", O was in position 5 and found not to be there? Now in ""WOOZY"", we put O at positions 2 and 3, not 1 or 4 or 5? Position 5 is Y, so okay.\n\nBut we might want to test different positions? For example, put O at the beginning? But we don\'t know.\n\nIn ""WOOZY"", O is at positions 2 and 3? That might be okay.\n\nAnother word: ""JOCKY""? J,O,C,K,Y? C excluded? Yes.\n\nNot.\n\n""ZOWIE"": Z,O,W,I,E? I and E excluded? Yes.\n\nNo.\n\nSo perhaps ""WOOZY"" is fine.\n\nBut we have Q available? ""OQUET""? Not a word.\n\n""TOQUE""? T excluded? Yes.\n\nSo best bet is ""WOOZY"" or ""DOOZY"".\n\nI think ""WOOZY"" is a reasonable choice.\n\nBut let\'s think: we might want to avoid double letters? But Wordle allows double letters, and the feedback will tell.\n\nNote: we have to include O, and from available letters, it\'s hard.\n\nAnother word: ""BOXTY""? B and T excluded? B excluded, T excluded.\n\n""HYDRO""? H,Y,D,R,O? R excluded.\n\nNo.\n\nTherefore, I think ""WOOZY"" is acceptable.\n\nSo I choose ""WOOZY"".\n\nWe have to remember that the word must contain O, so ""WOOZY"" has O.\n\nIf we guess ""WOOZY"", and if O is in the word, it will show as \'-\' for O if in wrong position, or \'✓\' if correct.\n\nBut in this case, we know O is in the word, but we don\'t know positions.\n\nThe goal is to get more information.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""HOOKY""? But H,O,O,K,Y? K and Y available? Yes. ""HOOKY"" is valid.\n\nBut ""HOOKY"" uses H,K,Y, while ""WOOZY"" uses W,Z,Y? So different.\n\nBoth test letters we haven\'t tried.\n\nBut W and Z versus H and K? H and K are more common? Actually, W, H, K, Y, Z: all are not very high frequency but we have limited choices.\n\nI think ""HOOKY"" might be better because it doesn\'t have Z, which is less common? But Z is possible.\n\nOr we can choose ""HOOKY"" to preserve letters like D,Z for later.\n\nBut I think it\'s fine.\n\nLet\'s go with ""WOOZY"" for now.\n\nBut note: we only have 12 available letters, and we must use O. So testing multiple O\'s is okay if the word has repeats.\n\nSo guess: ""WOOZY""\n\n<guess>woozy</guess>After analyzing the feedback:\n- **Guess 1 (""crane""):** All letters incorrect → C, R, A, N, E excluded.\n- **Guess 2 (""split""):** All letters incorrect → S, P, L, I, T excluded.\n- **Guess 3 (""gumbo""):** G, U, M, B incorrect → excluded.

We have feedback from four guesses:
1. ""crane"": All x → excluded C, R, A, N, E.
2. ""split"": All x → excluded S, P, L, I, T.
3. ""gumbo"": G(x), U(x), M(x), B(x), O(-) → O is in word but not at position 5; exclude G,U,M,B.
4. ""woozy"": W(-), O(✓), O(-), Z(x), Y(✓)

Feedback for ""woozy"":
- W(-): W is in word but not at position 1.
- First O(✓): O is at position 2 (correct).
- Second O(-): Since we already know O is at position 2, and the second O is at position 3, marked '-', which means there's another O in the word? Or it could be the same O?
  But note: in Wordle, if you guess a letter multiple times, and the word has only one instance, the feedback will mark one as correct or misplaced and the others as wrong if they exceed the count.

But here, the secret word must have at least two O's? Because the first O is marked ✓ (so position 2 is O), and the second O is marked '-' (meaning it's in the word but not at position 3). So if there were only one O, the second O would be marked 'x'. But since it's marked '-', there must be at least one more O in the secret word at a different position.

So, secret word has at least two O's. And from feedback:
- Position 2 is O (from O(✓)).
- There's another O somewhere else, but not at position 3 (since the second O is '-' and not at position 3).

Also:
- Y(✓): Y is at position 5 (correct).
- W(-): W is in the word but not at position 1.
- Z(x): Z is not in the word → exclude Z.

Moreover, Y must be at the end? Because Y(✓) at position 5? Wait: in ""woozy"", Y is at position 5? And marked ✓? So yes, position 5 is Y.

Therefore, we know:
- Position 2 is O.
- Position 5 is Y.
- At least one more O in the word (positions unknown).
- W is in the word but not at position 1.

And the full secret word pattern: _ O _ _ Y

Now, from exclusion, we have excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,L,I,T,G,U,M,B,Z.

Available letters: D,F,H,J,K,O,Q,V,W,X, and note O is already present twice? Wait, but we can use O again? However, we also have W.

Since we have W in the word but not position 1?

Now, the secret word must have:
- At least two O's: one fixed at position 2.
- W somewhere not at 1? Positions available: 1,3,4? But not 2 and 5? Position 2 is O, position 5 is Y. So positions 1,3,4 are open.

We also know that the word must have not at position 1? So W can be at 3 or 4.

And the remaining letters: we have two positions to fill (1,3,4) but three positions? Actually, positions: 1, 3, 4.

But we have at least one more O to place? And possibly W, plus another letter? Since we have three positions.

Structure: Letter1, O (position 2), Letter3, Letter4, Y (position 5).

And the word must contain at least two O's? Position 2 is one O, so positions 1,3, or 4 must have at least one O.

Also, W is in the word? But W can be at position 3 or 4? But W could also be at position 1? But wait: in ""woozy"" feedback, W is marked '-' meaning present but not at 1? So since it's position 1 in our guess was wrong, meaning W cannot be at position 1? So W must be at position 3 or 4.

Therefore:
- Position 1: cannot be W? But must be one of remaining letters? Not W? And not excluded.

Available letters: D,F,H,J,K,O,Q,V,W,X (and O,W are confirmed to be in).

But we also have at least one more O and W in the positions, so we need to use letters including O and W for positions 1,3,4? But position 1 cannot be W? So position 1 must be one of D,F,H,J,K,O,Q,V,X (but Q,V,X are less likely).

Now, we have to form a word with pattern _ O _ _ Y

With letters: We know O at 2, Y at 5, and we need at least one more O? And W in the word at 3 or 4.

But let's list the mandatory letters: O (at least two), Y (at position 5), W (somewhere).

Available letters: D,F,H,J,K,O,Q,V,W,X (since Z excluded).

And excluded: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,L,I,T,G,U,M,B,Z.

Now, possible words that fit the pattern? We'll guess the next word to uncover.

But we also note: in ""woozy"", the second O at position 3 was marked '-' meaning present but wrong position? Since we know position 3 is not O? So that O might be correctly at 2? But we already have that? Or? Wait, no: the word has two O's. The O at position 2 is ✓, meaning correct. The O at position 3 is in the word but wrong position? But if the word has only two O's, then position 3 is wrong? But since position 2 is already taken? Then the other O must be elsewhere? So positions: 1 or 4? So position 1 or 4 has an O.

Therefore, let's summarize:

Secret word structure:
Positions: 
1: ? 
2: O (fixed)
3: ? 
4: ? 
5: Y (fixed)

And the word contains:
+ At least one O at positions 1 or 4.
+ W at positions 3 or 4 (but not position 1).
+ Also, from ""gumbo"", O was present but not at 5, now we know O at 2? And possibly others.

Since O is at 2 and we have another O, so two O's? Unless more? But at least two.

Now, we need to guess a word that fits and tests possible letters.

Possible candidates:

Options for position 1: Cannot be W? And must be from available letters? And if position 1 is O? Then we have O at 1 and 2? But that's allowed.

Similarly, if position 4 is O.

But let's think of English words of form: ? O ? ? Y

With available letters: D,F,H,J,K,O,Q,V,W,X

And we must include W? And at least one more O? So in positions 1,3,4 we have the letters? With one being O? And W? And the other also?

Given the constraints:

Case 1: Position 1 is O.
Then word: O O ? ? Y
But then position 2 is O? So ""OO"" at beginning? And we need one more letter? Positions: 3 and 4? Must have W? And possibly another letter? But we have only two positions, so W must be one, and the other letter.

But words like ""OOWY""? Not English.

""OOLOGY""? Too long? 5 letters: O O L O G Y? But L excluded? So cannot.

""OOZ"" something? But OOZED? E excluded? And we already excluded.

""OOZLY"" not word.

So probably position 1 is not O? Then let's assume position 1 is not O? Then position 4 must be O? Because the second O must be somewhere? Since positions 2 and 5 fixed? So at position 4?

Then pattern: ? O _ O Y

And we must place W at position 3? Then: ? O W O Y

But what can position 1 be? Possible English words? Like ""DOW OY""? No.

""COW OY""? C excluded.

""HOW OY""? H O W O Y? ""HOWOY""? Not word.

""JOW OY""? J O W O Y? ""JOWOY""? Not word.

""VOWOY""? Not word.

""WOWOY""? W O W O Y? But then W at position 3, and let's check: H O W O Y? But no.

Another word? ""KOW TOW""? Not 5.

Perhaps ""DOX OY""? But Z excluded? Etc.

Maybe position 4 is O? And position 3 is W? Then we need position 1: ? O W O Y

Possible? With available letters: D,F,H,J,K,Q,V,X? But Q,V,X unlikely.

How about ""H O W O Y"" -> ""HOWOY""? Not valid.

""B O W O Y""? B excluded? B from gumbo excluded.

Another idea: perhaps the other O is at position 1? But we thought ""OO"" is hard? Maybe ""O O W Y something""? Not.

Perhaps the word has only two O's? But we need to place the second O.

Position 4 is O? But then W must be somewhere? If position 4 is O? Then position 1 and 3 available? And W must be at 3 or 4? But position 4 is O, so W at 3? So ? O W O Y

Now, position 1 can be: say H? ""HOW OY""? Not word.

D? ""DOW OY""? No.

F? ""FOW OY""? ""FOWOY""? No.

J? ""JOWOY""? No.

K? ""KOWOY""? No.

V? ""VOWOY""? No.

W? But position 1 cannot be W? From feedback: W not at 1.

Q? Not.

X? ""XOWOY""? Probably not.

So ? O W O Y: no valid word.

Then, perhaps position 1 is O? Then pattern O O _ _ Y

And then we need to fill positions 3 and 4? Must include W? And not O? Because we have two O's already? But could there be three O's? Possible? But if position 3 or 4 is O, that's fine? But we have to test.

From feedback of ""woozy"", the second O at position 3 was '-', meaning it's in the word but not at 3? So it could mean at position 4? Then in secret word, O at 2,4? Or at 1? But if position 1 is O? Then we have position 1 O, position 2 O, and we need another O at 4? Then three O's? Possible.

So structure: O O _ O Y? Then position 3 must be a letter? And W is in the word? So could be at position 3? Then ""O O W O Y""

But is ""OOWOY"" a word? Unlikely. Or any words?

Another possibility: position 3 could be something else? But let's list words: ""BOO K Y""? But B excluded, K not used? Etc.

Perhaps the word is ""JOLLY""? But L excluded.

Or ""WOOLY""? W,O,O,L,Y? But L excluded. No?

Perhaps positions: if position 1 is O, position 2 O, then position 3? say H, and position 4? Y? But position 5 is Y, so position 4 Y would be redundant? But "" O O H Y Y""? But only 5 letters? Positions: 1 O, 2 O, 3 H, 4 something, 5 Y? Oh, not two Y's? So position 4 can be another letter.

Candidates for position 3 and 4: must include W? But not necessarily? We must have W in the word? At position 3 or 4? And also position 4 could be O? Or not.

But we know from feedback that the secret word contains W? And the other O somewhere.

Let's assume the secret word has O at 2, Y at 5, and O at 1 or 4, and W at 3 or 4 (if not occupied by O).

But position 4 can be W or O? Or the other letter.

But from available letters, if position 1 is O, then positions 3 and 4: one must be W? But W must be in there? And the other could be O or another letter.

So possibilities:

If position 1 is O, then:
- Position 3: not O? Since in ""woozy"", position 3 O was marked '-' meaning not at 3? So position 3 cannot be O? For the secret word, position 3 is not O? Because if it were O, then in ""woozy"", guessing O at position 3 would be correct? But it was marked as '-', meaning present but wrong position? Which means that position 3 is not O in the secret word.

Therefore, the other O cannot be at position 3? So it must be at position 1 or 4.

Similarly, position 3 cannot be O? And position 5 is Y? So only positions 1 or 4 for the other O.

Now, we have position 1: if O, then we need position 4 to be not O? Or can be? But we have only two O's? Or more? But at least one more O.

But if position 1 is O, position 2 is O, position 5 Y, position 4 O would be three O's? Possible.

But positions: key is position 3 and 4: one of them must be W? And position 3 cannot be O? So if position 4 is O? Then position 3 must be W? Then ""O O W O Y""

But what is that? ""O O W O Y"" -> not a standard word.

Or position 1 is not O? Then position 4 must be O? And then position 1 must be something else? Available letter: D,F,H,J,K,Q,V,X? F,H,K possible? And position 3: must be W? Because W must be at 3 or 4? Position 4 is O, so W at position 3? Then pattern: ? O W O Y

And position 1: let's try. For example, ""H O W O Y"" -> ""HOW OY"" not word. ""D O W O Y"" -> ""DOW OY"" not. ""F O W O Y"" -> ""FOW OY"" not. ""J O W O Y"" -> ""JOW OY"" not. Etc.

So the only possibility is that position 1 is O? But then ""O O _ O Y""

But position 3 and4: position 3 cannot be O? We established earlier? So position 4 must be O? Then position 3 must be W? So ""O O W O Y"" which is not a word.

Contradiction? What's wrong?

Perhaps we misinterpreted the feedback. Let me double-check.

In guess 4: ""woozy"" -> W O O Z Y
Feedback: W(-), O(✓), O(-), Z(x), Y(✓)

So:
- W at position 1: '-' -> W is in the word but not at position 1.
- First O at position 2: '✓' -> letter and position correct.
- Second O at position 3: '-' -> this O is in the word but not at position 3. So the secret word has at least two O's? Or if only two, the other O is not at position 3? But since position 2 is already O, the other O must be at position 1 or 4 or 5? But position 5 is Y? Fixed? So position 1 or 4 must be O.

But as above.

Yet, ""bookworm"" is 8 letters.

Another idea: perhaps the secret word has only two O's? At position 2 and, say, position 4? Then in ""woozy"", the second O at position 3 is correct? But the feedback is '-' for position 3, meaning not correct position? So position 3 cannot be O? So secret word position 3 is not O.

So for position 3 in the secret word, it is not O? And not W? But W is in the word? So position 3 or 4 must be W? And position 1 or 4 must be O.

But position 4 cannot be both W and O? So it must be one or the other? Or the word has three letters: O, W, and another, to fill positions 1,3,4.

Available letters: D,F,H,J,K,O,Q,V,W,X.

But O and W are used.

Now, let's list possible words fitting pattern ? O ? ? Y

With letters for position 1,3,4 from available, including O and W.

Since the secret word has O at 2, Y at 5, and for the second O, it must be at 1 or 4.

Similarly, W must be at 3 or 4.

But position 4 cannot be both O and W? Unless it's OW or something? No, one letter per position.

So possible scenarios:

1. Position 1: O
   Then we need position 4 to be not O? or O? But if position 4 is O, then position 3 must be W? But ""O O W O Y"" not word.

   If position 1 is O, and position 4 is not O, then position 4 must be something else, and position 3 must be W? But we have no O in position 4? But we need another O? If position 1 is O, that's the second O? Then no need for position 4 to be O? But if only two O's, yes. So position 1 is O (second O), position 2 O, position 3 W, position 4 another letter, say H, position 5 Y? ""O O W H Y"" -> ""oowhy""? Not a word.

2. Position 1 is not O, so position 4 must be O.
   Then position 3 cannot be O? Position 3 must be W? Because W must be at 3 or 4? Position 4 is O, so W at 3? Then ""? O W O Y""
   Position 1 must be available letter: D,F,H,J,K,Q,V,X.

   Possible words: 
   - ""DOW OY"" not
   - ""FOW OY"" not
   - etc. as before.

So only possibility left is that the secret word has three O's!? Then position 1,2,4 are O? But position 3 must be W? Then ""O O W O Y"" -> ""oo o"" something.

But what English word is ""O O W O Y""? None.

Perhaps position 1 is W? But wait, we have feedback that W is '-' at position 1? So W cannot be at position 1? So it cannot be.

Another clue: in ""gumbo"", we had O at position 5 in guess, but secret word only at . position not 5? Now we have O at 2? So that's covered.

Perhaps the feedback for the O in ""woozy"" position 3 is '-' because the secret word has O at position 4, for example, and we only have two O's? Then the '-' at position 3 means that there is an O at some other position? But position 2 is already one O? So position 4 must be O? Then in secret word, positions: 2 and 4 are O.

Then structure: position 1: ? , position 2: O, position 3: ? , position 4: O, position 5: Y.

And W is in the word? Position 1 cannot be W? So position  must be W? Or position 3 must be W.

So if position 3 is W? Then ""? O W O Y""

If position 1 is letter, and position 3 is W? Then ""? O W O Y""

Possible words: if position 1 is ""H"", ""HOW OY"" not.

But maybe ""THYMY""? Not.

Perhaps "" JOWL Y""? But not 5 letters.

Another idea: ""rowlock"" not.

Perhaps we missed a word: ""HO  to something.

Let's search: 5-letter words ending in OY? Like ""coyer""? E excluded. ""employ"" E and excluded letters.

With available letters: ? O ? O Y

Position 1: D,F,H,J,K,Q,V,X

Position 3: must be a letter? And if we put W at position 3, then ""HOWOY"" not.

Other options for position 3: could be other letters, but we must have W in the word? So position 1 or 3 or 4 must be W? But position 4 is O? So position 1 or 3? But position 1 cannot be W? So position 3 must be W.

So required: position 3 must be W.

Then we have ""X O W O Y"" for position X at 1 with X in {D,F,H,J,K,Q,V,X}

None form valid words? For example, ""dow oy"" not.

Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that there might be three O's? Or the feedback is misinterpreted.

Perhaps the '-' for the second O in ""woozy"" does not mean an additional O? But in standard Wordle rules, it should.

But let's assume that the secret word is ""woo y"" with something.

Another possibility: the feedback means that for the second O, it is not position, but it is O and there is one more O somewhere else? But we have to place it.

Perhaps position 1 is 'W' but what? But feedback said W at position 1 is '-' so not there.

Let's think of available letters. Maybe ""DOWKY""? K excluded? But K is available.

But ""DOWKY"" is not common? Or ""JOCKY"" C excluded.

Perhaps ""DOWNY"": O,W,N,Y? But N excluded from ""crane"", so no.

""TOWNY"": T and N excluded.

 etc.

Let's list all possible 5-letter words with pattern ?O??Y, using available letters: D,Fet al.

For example, ""FOY "" no.

""HOY "" with double letter? ""HOYXY"" not.

Perhaps ""JOWAR"": J O W A R? But A and R excluded? No.

""DOVKY"" not word.

""VOWEL"": V O W E L? E and L excluded? No.

So no common words.

Perhaps it's ""goxes"" no.

Another idea: perhaps Y is not only at 5? In secret word, position 5 is Y, but other positions? But doesn't help.

Or we have not used Q? ""QOPHY"" not word.

Perhaps the word is ""oxyge"". not 5.

I think there's a mistake.

Perhaps in ""woozy"", the W at position 1 is '-' so W is in the word but not 1, and the O at position 2 is '✓' so O at 2, O at position 3 is '-' so there must be another O not at 3, and at position 4 we have Z which is x, so not, and Y at 5 is '✓' so Y at 5.

So secret word must have O at 2, Y at 5, W somewhere not 1, and at least one more O not at 3.

The only positions left are 1 or 4.

If position 4 is O, then the word is ? O ? O Y

With ? at 1 and ? at 3.

W is one of them, and not at 1? So W at position 3? Then ? O W O Y

But what can position 1 be? Let's try D: ""DOWOY"" - may be accepted as ""dow oy"" not, but perhaps ""dhow""? Not.

Perhaps ""KHOW"" not.

""SHOWY"": S,H,O,W,Y? But S and H? S excluded? From ""split"", S excluded? Yes. And position 2 O? But ""SHOWY"" has O at position 3? Not position 2.

Not.

Perhaps the word is ""ROWDY"": R,O,W,D,Y? R excluded? Yes.

No.

""GONGS"" not.

I think we have to consider that the available letters include H, and ""H O W O Y"" might be a typo, or we accept ""HOW OY"" as informal? But not.

Perhaps ""BOOZY"": but B excluded.

Or ""MOODY"": M and O excluded? M from gumbo excluded.

No.

Another thought: in ""gumbo"", O was at position 5, and marked '-', so secret word has O not at 5, but position 5 is now Y? Fixed.

Perhaps try a guess like ""dowly"" but L excluded.

I found a word: ""DOUBT"" but B and U excluded.

Not.

Perhaps ""FOX Y"" with different spelling? No.

With available letters, let's try ""WHOXY"" not.

Perhaps the secret word is ""WO AL Y"" no.

I think we need to guess a word that guesses the missing letters.

From pattern, we can guess:

For example, assume position 4 is O? Then pattern ? O ? O Y

Position 1: say H
Position 3: W -> ""H O W O Y"" not word.

Then try position 3: say D ? ""H O D O Y"" -> ""hod oy"" not.

Or position 1 F, position 3 D: ""F O D O Y"" -> ""fod oy"" not.

 Or ""J O K O Y"" -> ""jokoy"" not a word.

Or ""K O W O Y"" -> ""kow oy"" not.

 so perhaps position 4 is not O? Then position 1 must be O? Then pattern O O ? ? Y

Position 3: cannot be O? available letters for position 3: say W? So O O W ? Y

Position 4: must be a letter? say D: ""O O W D Y"" -> ""oowdy"" not word.

H: ""oowhy"" not.

K: ""oowky"" not.

So no.

Perhaps position 4 is O? O O ? O Y? Then position 3: a letter? say W: ""O O W O Y"" same as before.

 not.

I think there might be a word like ""woozy"" but with different? Or our earlier conclusion is correct? But no word.

Perhaps the feedback for the second O in ""woozy"" might be because the secret word has only one O? But then position 3 O should be 'x' if only one O? But it was '-', so at least two O's.

Yes.

Unless the secret word is ""woozy"" itself? But feedback was W(-), O(✓), O(-), Z(x), Y(✓) so secret word has O at 2 and Y at 5, but not Z, and W in the word but not at 1, and another O at different position? But ""woozy"" has O at position 2 and 3? But feedback says at position 3 O is '-', so if secret is ""woozy"", position 3 O would be '✓'? But it's not? So not ""woozy"".

For example, if secret is ""FOYER"", but many excluded.

No, secret word is unknown.

Perhaps positions: the secret word has O at position 4? For example, ""DOG OY"" not.

""JOG Y"" not.

Let's give up and guess a word that fits the pattern with available letters and includes W and O.

For example, guess ""HOWDY"" but D and Y? But feedback has Y at 5? But ""HOWDY"" has Y? ""HOWDY"" is H O W D Y? So position 2 O, position 5 Y, and W at position 3? Position 4 D.

But is ""HOWDY"" a word? Yes, meaning a greeting.

But what about the O count? In ""HOWDY"", only one O? At position 2? But we think there are two O's? In ""woozy"" feedback, the second O was '-', which would mean that there is another O in the secret word? But in ""HOWDY"" only one O, so for guess ""woozy"", if secret is ""HOWDY"", then:

- W at p1: secret word has W? Yes, at p3? So feedback should be '-' for W? Correct.
- First O at p2: secret has O at p2? Yes, so '✓' correct.
- Second O at p3: secret has no O at p3? And only one O? So should be 'x' because only one O and it's at p2? But in feedback it was '-', which would be wrong if only one O.

So if secret is ""HOWDY"", then for the second O in ""woozy"", since secret has only one O, it should be 'x'. But we got '-', so not.

Therefore, secret word must have at least two O's.

 similarly, if secret has two O's, then in ""woozy"", O at p3 is not present? Then it should be 'x' unless there are two O's and one is at p2, the other not at p3, so '-' means it is present elsewhere.

Back to square one.

Perhaps position 4 is O, and position p1 is a letter, and position p3 is not W? But what? Then let's assume the secret word does not have to have W? But from feedback in ""woozy"", W is '-' at p1, so must be in the word? Yes.

So we must have W somewhere.

So for position p3, must be W? As earlier. and position p4 O, and position p1? and no word.

Perhaps we overlooked a letter. Available letters include F,H,J,K, etc.

Make a guess like ""HO W O Y"" with position 1 H, position 2 O, position 3 W, position 4 O, position 5 Y: ""HOWOY"" or ""H O W O Y"".

If we guess it, feedback will tell.

But we risk.

Otherwise, we have only a few letters left.

List of available: D,F,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X,O,Y (but O and Y used)

For guess, we can try ""H O W O Y"" as ""howoy"", though it may not be valid, or choose.

Another word: ""DOFFY"" but F double? ""DoOff Y""? Not.

""YOWED"" E excluded.

Perhaps ""WOOFY"" W,O,O,F,Y? But position 1 W? But feedback from ""woozy"" W not at p1? So if we guess ""WOOFY"", position 1 W, but secret word W cannot be at 1, so if we guess W at 1, it will be marked '-' or 'x'? If secret W not at 1, then 'x' if not in word? But ' ' since present would be '-'.

But 'WOOFY' has O,O,F,W,Y? Pattern: position 2 and 3 are O? It would then have O at 2 and 3, but we need position 2 O fixed? Yes. Position 5 Y fixed. But then O at 3? But in previous feedback, position 3 O was marked '-' in ""woozy"", which means secret position 3 is not O? But in ""WOOFY"", if we guess, position 3 is O, which might be correct or not.

So to test, guess ""WOOFY"".

Position 1: W, position 2: O, position 3: O, position 4: F, position 5: Y.

But from available letters, F is available? Yes.

So <guess>woofy</guess>

Or better, guess ""HOWDY"" even though it might not have the O's.

But let's calculate the feedback.

For position 1: if secret W not at 1, then '-' if W present, or 'x' if not.

But it might be.

But to be systematic, we have few options.

Another common word? I recall ""roomy"" but R and M excluded.

So ""woofy"" is a word? Yes, meaning rich in wool or something.

And it has two O's? And W at 1, position fixed.

But position 1 is W? Which is not allowed? Because from feedback, W cannot be at position 1? But in guess, we can guess anything? The feedback will tell.

So for ""woofy"":

- Position 1 W: if secret W not at 1, then '-' (since W present elsewhere)
- Position 2 O: '✓' (since secret position 2 is O)
- Position 3 O: if secret position 3 is not O, and secret has only two O's at 2 and say 4, then '-' for position 3 O? Because O is present but not at 3.

Then position 4 F: we don't know.
Position 5 Y: '✓'

So it might give information.

So I'll go with ""WOOFY"".

<guess>woofy</guess> 

After all, we have to guess.

Or better, ""HOWDY"" with only one O, but if secret has two O's, it may be wrong, but we can guess.

But let's do ""WOOFY"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses and the constraints deduced, the analysis is as follows:

### Deductions from Feedback:
1. **Excluded Letters**: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, L, I, T, G, U, M, B, Z (from all ""x"" feedback).
2. **Confirmed Letters and Positions**: 
   - O is at position 2 (from Guess 4: ""woozy"" → O(✓)).
   - Y is at position 5 (from Guess 4: ""woozy"" → Y(✓)).
3. **Letters in Word but Wrong Position**: 
   - W is present in the word but not at position 1 (from Guess 4: ""woozy"" → W(-)).
   - The second O (from ""woozy"") is present but not at position 3. Combined with O(✓) at position 2, this confirms at least two O's in the word, with the second O not at position 3 (implying it could be at position 1 or 4).
4. **Remaining Available Letters**: D, F, H, J, K, O, Q, V, W, X.
5. **Word Pattern**: The secret word must be of the form _ O _ _ Y, with positions 1, 3, and 4 unknown, but must include W and at least one more O.

### Step-By-Step Reasoning:
- **Pattern Constraints**: The word must have the pattern ? O ? ? Y, with O at position 2 and Y at position 5. Positions 1, 3, and 4 must be filled using available letters, including W and at least one more O.
- **Letter Constraints**: Position 1 cannot be W (from W(-)), and position 3 cannot be O (from O(-) in Guess 4).
- **Combination Challenges**: Available letters are limited (~10), and common words are scarce due to the pattern and repeated O's. Possible candidates include:
  - ""HOWDY"": Tests H, O, W, D, Y. However, it has only one O, conflicting with the requirement for at least two O's.
  - ""WOOFY"": Tests W, O, O, F, Y. It fits the pattern (W at position 1—which must be misplaced per feedback), two O's (position 2 fixed, position 3 to test), and Y at position 5. This could reveal:
    - If W is in the word but not position 1, feedback will be W(-).
    - If the secret word has an additional O at position 3 or elsewhere, it will appear in feedback.
- **Why ""WOOFY""?**: Despite W at position 1 potentially being invalid per feedback, guessing ""WOOFY"" leverages:
  - **Position 4**: Tests F, a new common letter.
  - **Information Gain**: Confirms W (position or presence), the letter at position 4 (F), and resolves the second O location.
  - **Balanced Letters**: Uses high-frequency available consonants (W, F) and probes for the second O position.

### Decision:
- ""WOOFY"" is valid English (meaning wool-like) and respects the constraints. It is chosen to gather critical information on W, the second O, and position 4, with available letters.

<guess>woofy</guess>",woofy,"We have feedback from four guesses:
1. ""crane"": All x → excluded C, R, A, N, E.
2. ""split"": All x → excluded S, P, L, I, T.
3. ""gumbo"": G(x), U(x), M(x), B(x), O(-) → O is in word but not at position 5; exclude G,U,M,B.
4. ""woozy"": W(-), O(✓), O(-), Z(x), Y(✓)

Feedback for ""woozy"":
- W(-): W is in word but not at position 1.
- First O(✓): O is at position 2 (correct).
- Second O(-): Since we already know O is at position 2, and the second O is at position 3, marked '-', which means there's another O in the word? Or it could be the same O?
  But note: in Wordle, if you guess a letter multiple times, and the word has only one instance, the feedback will mark one as correct or misplaced and the others as wrong if they exceed the count.

But here, the secret word must have at least two O's? Because the first O is marked ✓ (so position 2 is O), and the second O is marked '-' (meaning it's in the word but not at position 3). So if there were only one O, the second O would be marked 'x'. But since it's marked '-', there must be at least one more O in the secret word at a different position.

So, secret word has at least two O's. And from feedback:
- Position 2 is O (from O(✓)).
- There's another O somewhere else, but not at position 3 (since the second O is '-' and not at position 3).

Also:
- Y(✓): Y is at position 5 (correct).
- W(-): W is in the word but not at position 1.
- Z(x): Z is not in the word → exclude Z.

Moreover, Y must be at the end? Because Y(✓) at position 5? Wait: in ""woozy"", Y is at position 5? And marked ✓? So yes, position 5 is Y.

Therefore, we know:
- Position 2 is O.
- Position 5 is Y.
- At least one more O in the word (positions unknown).
- W is in the word but not at position 1.

And the full secret word pattern: _ O _ _ Y

Now, from exclusion, we have excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,L,I,T,G,U,M,B,Z.

Available letters: D,F,H,J,K,O,Q,V,W,X, and note O is already present twice? Wait, but we can use O again? However, we also have W.

Since we have W in the word but not position 1?

Now, the secret word must have:
- At least two O's: one fixed at position 2.
- W somewhere not at 1? Positions available: 1,3,4? But not 2 and 5? Position 2 is O, position 5 is Y. So positions 1,3,4 are open.

We also know that the word must have not at position 1? So W can be at 3 or 4.

And the remaining letters: we have two positions to fill (1,3,4) but three positions? Actually, positions: 1, 3, 4.

But we have at least one more O to place? And possibly W, plus another letter? Since we have three positions.

Structure: Letter1, O (position 2), Letter3, Letter4, Y (position 5).

And the word must contain at least two O's? Position 2 is one O, so positions 1,3, or 4 must have at least one O.

Also, W is in the word? But W can be at position 3 or 4? But W could also be at position 1? But wait: in ""woozy"" feedback, W is marked '-' meaning present but not at 1? So since it's position 1 in our guess was wrong, meaning W cannot be at position 1? So W must be at position 3 or 4.

Therefore:
- Position 1: cannot be W? But must be one of remaining letters? Not W? And not excluded.

Available letters: D,F,H,J,K,O,Q,V,W,X (and O,W are confirmed to be in).

But we also have at least one more O and W in the positions, so we need to use letters including O and W for positions 1,3,4? But position 1 cannot be W? So position 1 must be one of D,F,H,J,K,O,Q,V,X (but Q,V,X are less likely).

Now, we have to form a word with pattern _ O _ _ Y

With letters: We know O at 2, Y at 5, and we need at least one more O? And W in the word at 3 or 4.

But let's list the mandatory letters: O (at least two), Y (at position 5), W (somewhere).

Available letters: D,F,H,J,K,O,Q,V,W,X (since Z excluded).

And excluded: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,L,I,T,G,U,M,B,Z.

Now, possible words that fit the pattern? We'll guess the next word to uncover.

But we also note: in ""woozy"", the second O at position 3 was marked '-' meaning present but wrong position? Since we know position 3 is not O? So that O might be correctly at 2? But we already have that? Or? Wait, no: the word has two O's. The O at position 2 is ✓, meaning correct. The O at position 3 is in the word but wrong position? But if the word has only two O's, then position 3 is wrong? But since position 2 is already taken? Then the other O must be elsewhere? So positions: 1 or 4? So position 1 or 4 has an O.

Therefore, let's summarize:

Secret word structure:
Positions: 
1: ? 
2: O (fixed)
3: ? 
4: ? 
5: Y (fixed)

And the word contains:
+ At least one O at positions 1 or 4.
+ W at positions 3 or 4 (but not position 1).
+ Also, from ""gumbo"", O was present but not at 5, now we know O at 2? And possibly others.

Since O is at 2 and we have another O, so two O's? Unless more? But at least two.

Now, we need to guess a word that fits and tests possible letters.

Possible candidates:

Options for position 1: Cannot be W? And must be from available letters? And if position 1 is O? Then we have O at 1 and 2? But that's allowed.

Similarly, if position 4 is O.

But let's think of English words of form: ? O ? ? Y

With available letters: D,F,H,J,K,O,Q,V,W,X

And we must include W? And at least one more O? So in positions 1,3,4 we have the letters? With one being O? And W? And the other also?

Given the constraints:

Case 1: Position 1 is O.
Then word: O O ? ? Y
But then position 2 is O? So ""OO"" at beginning? And we need one more letter? Positions: 3 and 4? Must have W? And possibly another letter? But we have only two positions, so W must be one, and the other letter.

But words like ""OOWY""? Not English.

""OOLOGY""? Too long? 5 letters: O O L O G Y? But L excluded? So cannot.

""OOZ"" something? But OOZED? E excluded? And we already excluded.

""OOZLY"" not word.

So probably position 1 is not O? Then let's assume position 1 is not O? Then position 4 must be O? Because the second O must be somewhere? Since positions 2 and 5 fixed? So at position 4?

Then pattern: ? O _ O Y

And we must place W at position 3? Then: ? O W O Y

But what can position 1 be? Possible English words? Like ""DOW OY""? No.

""COW OY""? C excluded.

""HOW OY""? H O W O Y? ""HOWOY""? Not word.

""JOW OY""? J O W O Y? ""JOWOY""? Not word.

""VOWOY""? Not word.

""WOWOY""? W O W O Y? But then W at position 3, and let's check: H O W O Y? But no.

Another word? ""KOW TOW""? Not 5.

Perhaps ""DOX OY""? But Z excluded? Etc.

Maybe position 4 is O? And position 3 is W? Then we need position 1: ? O W O Y

Possible? With available letters: D,F,H,J,K,Q,V,X? But Q,V,X unlikely.

How about ""H O W O Y"" -> ""HOWOY""? Not valid.

""B O W O Y""? B excluded? B from gumbo excluded.

Another idea: perhaps the other O is at position 1? But we thought ""OO"" is hard? Maybe ""O O W Y something""? Not.

Perhaps the word has only two O's? But we need to place the second O.

Position 4 is O? But then W must be somewhere? If position 4 is O? Then position 1 and 3 available? And W must be at 3 or 4? But position 4 is O, so W at 3? So ? O W O Y

Now, position 1 can be: say H? ""HOW OY""? Not word.

D? ""DOW OY""? No.

F? ""FOW OY""? ""FOWOY""? No.

J? ""JOWOY""? No.

K? ""KOWOY""? No.

V? ""VOWOY""? No.

W? But position 1 cannot be W? From feedback: W not at 1.

Q? Not.

X? ""XOWOY""? Probably not.

So ? O W O Y: no valid word.

Then, perhaps position 1 is O? Then pattern O O _ _ Y

And then we need to fill positions 3 and 4? Must include W? And not O? Because we have two O's already? But could there be three O's? Possible? But if position 3 or 4 is O, that's fine? But we have to test.

From feedback of ""woozy"", the second O at position 3 was '-', meaning it's in the word but not at 3? So it could mean at position 4? Then in secret word, O at 2,4? Or at 1? But if position 1 is O? Then we have position 1 O, position 2 O, and we need another O at 4? Then three O's? Possible.

So structure: O O _ O Y? Then position 3 must be a letter? And W is in the word? So could be at position 3? Then ""O O W O Y""

But is ""OOWOY"" a word? Unlikely. Or any words?

Another possibility: position 3 could be something else? But let's list words: ""BOO K Y""? But B excluded, K not used? Etc.

Perhaps the word is ""JOLLY""? But L excluded.

Or ""WOOLY""? W,O,O,L,Y? But L excluded. No?

Perhaps positions: if position 1 is O, position 2 O, then position 3? say H, and position 4? Y? But position 5 is Y, so position 4 Y would be redundant? But "" O O H Y Y""? But only 5 letters? Positions: 1 O, 2 O, 3 H, 4 something, 5 Y? Oh, not two Y's? So position 4 can be another letter.

Candidates for position 3 and 4: must include W? But not necessarily? We must have W in the word? At position 3 or 4? And also position 4 could be O? Or not.

But we know from feedback that the secret word contains W? And the other O somewhere.

Let's assume the secret word has O at 2, Y at 5, and O at 1 or 4, and W at 3 or 4 (if not occupied by O).

But position 4 can be W or O? Or the other letter.

But from available letters, if position 1 is O, then positions 3 and 4: one must be W? But W must be in there? And the other could be O or another letter.

So possibilities:

If position 1 is O, then:
- Position 3: not O? Since in ""woozy"", position 3 O was marked '-' meaning not at 3? So position 3 cannot be O? For the secret word, position 3 is not O? Because if it were O, then in ""woozy"", guessing O at position 3 would be correct? But it was marked as '-', meaning present but wrong position? Which means that position 3 is not O in the secret word.

Therefore, the other O cannot be at position 3? So it must be at position 1 or 4.

Similarly, position 3 cannot be O? And position 5 is Y? So only positions 1 or 4 for the other O.

Now, we have position 1: if O, then we need position 4 to be not O? Or can be? But we have only two O's? Or more? But at least one more O.

But if position 1 is O, position 2 is O, position 5 Y, position 4 O would be three O's? Possible.

But positions: key is position 3 and 4: one of them must be W? And position 3 cannot be O? So if position 4 is O? Then position 3 must be W? Then ""O O W O Y""

But what is that? ""O O W O Y"" -> not a standard word.

Or position 1 is not O? Then position 4 must be O? And then position 1 must be something else? Available letter: D,F,H,J,K,Q,V,X? F,H,K possible? And position 3: must be W? Because W must be at 3 or 4? Position 4 is O, so W at position 3? Then pattern: ? O W O Y

And position 1: let's try. For example, ""H O W O Y"" -> ""HOW OY"" not word. ""D O W O Y"" -> ""DOW OY"" not. ""F O W O Y"" -> ""FOW OY"" not. ""J O W O Y"" -> ""JOW OY"" not. Etc.

So the only possibility is that position 1 is O? But then ""O O _ O Y""

But position 3 and4: position 3 cannot be O? We established earlier? So position 4 must be O? Then position 3 must be W? So ""O O W O Y"" which is not a word.

Contradiction? What's wrong?

Perhaps we misinterpreted the feedback. Let me double-check.

In guess 4: ""woozy"" -> W O O Z Y
Feedback: W(-), O(✓), O(-), Z(x), Y(✓)

So:
- W at position 1: '-' -> W is in the word but not at position 1.
- First O at position 2: '✓' -> letter and position correct.
- Second O at position 3: '-' -> this O is in the word but not at position 3. So the secret word has at least two O's? Or if only two, the other O is not at position 3? But since position 2 is already O, the other O must be at position 1 or 4 or 5? But position 5 is Y? Fixed? So position 1 or 4 must be O.

But as above.

Yet, ""bookworm"" is 8 letters.

Another idea: perhaps the secret word has only two O's? At position 2 and, say, position 4? Then in ""woozy"", the second O at position 3 is correct? But the feedback is '-' for position 3, meaning not correct position? So position 3 cannot be O? So secret word position 3 is not O.

So for position 3 in the secret word, it is not O? And not W? But W is in the word? So position 3 or 4 must be W? And position 1 or 4 must be O.

But position 4 cannot be both W and O? So it must be one or the other? Or the word has three letters: O, W, and another, to fill positions 1,3,4.

Available letters: D,F,H,J,K,O,Q,V,W,X.

But O and W are used.

Now, let's list possible words fitting pattern ? O ? ? Y

With letters for position 1,3,4 from available, including O and W.

Since the secret word has O at 2, Y at 5, and for the second O, it must be at 1 or 4.

Similarly, W must be at 3 or 4.

But position 4 cannot be both O and W? Unless it's OW or something? No, one letter per position.

So possible scenarios:

1. Position 1: O
   Then we need position 4 to be not O? or O? But if position 4 is O, then position 3 must be W? But ""O O W O Y"" not word.

   If position 1 is O, and position 4 is not O, then position 4 must be something else, and position 3 must be W? But we have no O in position 4? But we need another O? If position 1 is O, that's the second O? Then no need for position 4 to be O? But if only two O's, yes. So position 1 is O (second O), position 2 O, position 3 W, position 4 another letter, say H, position 5 Y? ""O O W H Y"" -> ""oowhy""? Not a word.

2. Position 1 is not O, so position 4 must be O.
   Then position 3 cannot be O? Position 3 must be W? Because W must be at 3 or 4? Position 4 is O, so W at 3? Then ""? O W O Y""
   Position 1 must be available letter: D,F,H,J,K,Q,V,X.

   Possible words: 
   - ""DOW OY"" not
   - ""FOW OY"" not
   - etc. as before.

So only possibility left is that the secret word has three O's!? Then position 1,2,4 are O? But position 3 must be W? Then ""O O W O Y"" -> ""oo o"" something.

But what English word is ""O O W O Y""? None.

Perhaps position 1 is W? But wait, we have feedback that W is '-' at position 1? So W cannot be at position 1? So it cannot be.

Another clue: in ""gumbo"", we had O at position 5 in guess, but secret word only at . position not 5? Now we have O at 2? So that's covered.

Perhaps the feedback for the O in ""woozy"" position 3 is '-' because the secret word has O at position 4, for example, and we only have two O's? Then the '-' at position 3 means that there is an O at some other position? But position 2 is already one O? So position 4 must be O? Then in secret word, positions: 2 and 4 are O.

Then structure: position 1: ? , position 2: O, position 3: ? , position 4: O, position 5: Y.

And W is in the word? Position 1 cannot be W? So position  must be W? Or position 3 must be W.

So if position 3 is W? Then ""? O W O Y""

If position 1 is letter, and position 3 is W? Then ""? O W O Y""

Possible words: if position 1 is ""H"", ""HOW OY"" not.

But maybe ""THYMY""? Not.

Perhaps "" JOWL Y""? But not 5 letters.

Another idea: ""rowlock"" not.

Perhaps we missed a word: ""HO  to something.

Let's search: 5-letter words ending in OY? Like ""coyer""? E excluded. ""employ"" E and excluded letters.

With available letters: ? O ? O Y

Position 1: D,F,H,J,K,Q,V,X

Position 3: must be a letter? And if we put W at position 3, then ""HOWOY"" not.

Other options for position 3: could be other letters, but we must have W in the word? So position 1 or 3 or 4 must be W? But position 4 is O? So position 1 or 3? But position 1 cannot be W? So position 3 must be W.

So required: position 3 must be W.

Then we have ""X O W O Y"" for position X at 1 with X in {D,F,H,J,K,Q,V,X}

None form valid words? For example, ""dow oy"" not.

Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that there might be three O's? Or the feedback is misinterpreted.

Perhaps the '-' for the second O in ""woozy"" does not mean an additional O? But in standard Wordle rules, it should.

But let's assume that the secret word is ""woo y"" with something.

Another possibility: the feedback means that for the second O, it is not position, but it is O and there is one more O somewhere else? But we have to place it.

Perhaps position 1 is 'W' but what? But feedback said W at position 1 is '-' so not there.

Let's think of available letters. Maybe ""DOWKY""? K excluded? But K is available.

But ""DOWKY"" is not common? Or ""JOCKY"" C excluded.

Perhaps ""DOWNY"": O,W,N,Y? But N excluded from ""crane"", so no.

""TOWNY"": T and N excluded.

 etc.

Let's list all possible 5-letter words with pattern ?O??Y, using available letters: D,Fet al.

For example, ""FOY "" no.

""HOY "" with double letter? ""HOYXY"" not.

Perhaps ""JOWAR"": J O W A R? But A and R excluded? No.

""DOVKY"" not word.

""VOWEL"": V O W E L? E and L excluded? No.

So no common words.

Perhaps it's ""goxes"" no.

Another idea: perhaps Y is not only at 5? In secret word, position 5 is Y, but other positions? But doesn't help.

Or we have not used Q? ""QOPHY"" not word.

Perhaps the word is ""oxyge"". not 5.

I think there's a mistake.

Perhaps in ""woozy"", the W at position 1 is '-' so W is in the word but not 1, and the O at position 2 is '✓' so O at 2, O at position 3 is '-' so there must be another O not at 3, and at position 4 we have Z which is x, so not, and Y at 5 is '✓' so Y at 5.

So secret word must have O at 2, Y at 5, W somewhere not 1, and at least one more O not at 3.

The only positions left are 1 or 4.

If position 4 is O, then the word is ? O ? O Y

With ? at 1 and ? at 3.

W is one of them, and not at 1? So W at position 3? Then ? O W O Y

But what can position 1 be? Let's try D: ""DOWOY"" - may be accepted as ""dow oy"" not, but perhaps ""dhow""? Not.

Perhaps ""KHOW"" not.

""SHOWY"": S,H,O,W,Y? But S and H? S excluded? From ""split"", S excluded? Yes. And position 2 O? But ""SHOWY"" has O at position 3? Not position 2.

Not.

Perhaps the word is ""ROWDY"": R,O,W,D,Y? R excluded? Yes.

No.

""GONGS"" not.

I think we have to consider that the available letters include H, and ""H O W O Y"" might be a typo, or we accept ""HOW OY"" as informal? But not.

Perhaps ""BOOZY"": but B excluded.

Or ""MOODY"": M and O excluded? M from gumbo excluded.

No.

Another thought: in ""gumbo"", O was at position 5, and marked '-', so secret word has O not at 5, but position 5 is now Y? Fixed.

Perhaps try a guess like ""dowly"" but L excluded.

I found a word: ""DOUBT"" but B and U excluded.

Not.

Perhaps ""FOX Y"" with different spelling? No.

With available letters, let's try ""WHOXY"" not.

Perhaps the secret word is ""WO AL Y"" no.

I think we need to guess a word that guesses the missing letters.

From pattern, we can guess:

For example, assume position 4 is O? Then pattern ? O ? O Y

Position 1: say H
Position 3: W -> ""H O W O Y"" not word.

Then try position 3: say D ? ""H O D O Y"" -> ""hod oy"" not.

Or position 1 F, position 3 D: ""F O D O Y"" -> ""fod oy"" not.

 Or ""J O K O Y"" -> ""jokoy"" not a word.

Or ""K O W O Y"" -> ""kow oy"" not.

 so perhaps position 4 is not O? Then position 1 must be O? Then pattern O O ? ? Y

Position 3: cannot be O? available letters for position 3: say W? So O O W ? Y

Position 4: must be a letter? say D: ""O O W D Y"" -> ""oowdy"" not word.

H: ""oowhy"" not.

K: ""oowky"" not.

So no.

Perhaps position 4 is O? O O ? O Y? Then position 3: a letter? say W: ""O O W O Y"" same as before.

 not.

I think there might be a word like ""woozy"" but with different? Or our earlier conclusion is correct? But no word.

Perhaps the feedback for the second O in ""woozy"" might be because the secret word has only one O? But then position 3 O should be 'x' if only one O? But it was '-', so at least two O's.

Yes.

Unless the secret word is ""woozy"" itself? But feedback was W(-), O(✓), O(-), Z(x), Y(✓) so secret word has O at 2 and Y at 5, but not Z, and W in the word but not at 1, and another O at different position? But ""woozy"" has O at position 2 and 3? But feedback says at position 3 O is '-', so if secret is ""woozy"", position 3 O would be '✓'? But it's not? So not ""woozy"".

For example, if secret is ""FOYER"", but many excluded.

No, secret word is unknown.

Perhaps positions: the secret word has O at position 4? For example, ""DOG OY"" not.

""JOG Y"" not.

Let's give up and guess a word that fits the pattern with available letters and includes W and O.

For example, guess ""HOWDY"" but D and Y? But feedback has Y at 5? But ""HOWDY"" has Y? ""HOWDY"" is H O W D Y? So position 2 O, position 5 Y, and W at position 3? Position 4 D.

But is ""HOWDY"" a word? Yes, meaning a greeting.

But what about the O count? In ""HOWDY"", only one O? At position 2? But we think there are two O's? In ""woozy"" feedback, the second O was '-', which would mean that there is another O in the secret word? But in ""HOWDY"" only one O, so for guess ""woozy"", if secret is ""HOWDY"", then:

- W at p1: secret word has W? Yes, at p3? So feedback should be '-' for W? Correct.
- First O at p2: secret has O at p2? Yes, so '✓' correct.
- Second O at p3: secret has no O at p3? And only one O? So should be 'x' because only one O and it's at p2? But in feedback it was '-', which would be wrong if only one O.

So if secret is ""HOWDY"", then for the second O in ""woozy"", since secret has only one O, it should be 'x'. But we got '-', so not.

Therefore, secret word must have at least two O's.

 similarly, if secret has two O's, then in ""woozy"", O at p3 is not present? Then it should be 'x' unless there are two O's and one is at p2, the other not at p3, so '-' means it is present elsewhere.

Back to square one.

Perhaps position 4 is O, and position p1 is a letter, and position p3 is not W? But what? Then let's assume the secret word does not have to have W? But from feedback in ""woozy"", W is '-' at p1, so must be in the word? Yes.

So we must have W somewhere.

So for position p3, must be W? As earlier. and position p4 O, and position p1? and no word.

Perhaps we overlooked a letter. Available letters include F,H,J,K, etc.

Make a guess like ""HO W O Y"" with position 1 H, position 2 O, position 3 W, position 4 O, position 5 Y: ""HOWOY"" or ""H O W O Y"".

If we guess it, feedback will tell.

But we risk.

Otherwise, we have only a few letters left.

List of available: D,F,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X,O,Y (but O and Y used)

For guess, we can try ""H O W O Y"" as ""howoy"", though it may not be valid, or choose.

Another word: ""DOFFY"" but F double? ""DoOff Y""? Not.

""YOWED"" E excluded.

Perhaps ""WOOFY"" W,O,O,F,Y? But position 1 W? But feedback from ""woozy"" W not at p1? So if we guess ""WOOFY"", position 1 W, but secret word W cannot be at 1, so if we guess W at 1, it will be marked '-' or 'x'? If secret W not at 1, then 'x' if not in word? But ' ' since present would be '-'.

But 'WOOFY' has O,O,F,W,Y? Pattern: position 2 and 3 are O? It would then have O at 2 and 3, but we need position 2 O fixed? Yes. Position 5 Y fixed. But then O at 3? But in previous feedback, position 3 O was marked '-' in ""woozy"", which means secret position 3 is not O? But in ""WOOFY"", if we guess, position 3 is O, which might be correct or not.

So to test, guess ""WOOFY"".

Position 1: W, position 2: O, position 3: O, position 4: F, position 5: Y.

But from available letters, F is available? Yes.

So <guess>woofy</guess>

Or better, guess ""HOWDY"" even though it might not have the O's.

But let's calculate the feedback.

For position 1: if secret W not at 1, then '-' if W present, or 'x' if not.

But it might be.

But to be systematic, we have few options.

Another common word? I recall ""roomy"" but R and M excluded.

So ""woofy"" is a word? Yes, meaning rich in wool or something.

And it has two O's? And W at 1, position fixed.

But position 1 is W? Which is not allowed? Because from feedback, W cannot be at position 1? But in guess, we can guess anything? The feedback will tell.

So for ""woofy"":

- Position 1 W: if secret W not at 1, then '-' (since W present elsewhere)
- Position 2 O: '✓' (since secret position 2 is O)
- Position 3 O: if secret position 3 is not O, and secret has only two O's at 2 and say 4, then '-' for position 3 O? Because O is present but not at 3.

Then position 4 F: we don't know.
Position 5 Y: '✓'

So it might give information.

So I'll go with ""WOOFY"".

<guess>woofy</guess> 

After all, we have to guess.

Or better, ""HOWDY"" with only one O, but if secret has two O's, it may be wrong, but we can guess.

But let's do ""WOOFY"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses and the constraints deduced, the analysis is as follows:

### Deductions from Feedback:
1. **Excluded Letters**: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, L, I, T, G, U, M, B, Z (from all ""x"" feedback).
2. **Confirmed Letters and Positions**: 
   - O is at position 2 (from Guess 4: ""woozy"" → O(✓)).
   - Y is at position 5 (from Guess 4: ""woozy"" → Y(✓)).
3. **Letters in Word but Wrong Position**: 
   - W is present in the word but not at position 1 (from Guess 4: ""woozy"" → W(-)).
   - The second O (from ""woozy"") is present but not at position 3. Combined with O(✓) at position 2, this confirms at least two O's in the word, with the second O not at position 3 (implying it could be at position 1 or 4).
4. **Remaining Available Letters**: D, F, H, J, K, O, Q, V, W, X.
5. **Word Pattern**: The secret word must be of the form _ O _ _ Y, with positions 1, 3, and 4 unknown, but must include W and at least one more O.

### Step-By-Step Reasoning:
- **Pattern Constraints**: The word must have the pattern ? O ? ? Y, with O at position 2 and Y at position 5. Positions 1, 3, and 4 must be filled using available letters, including W and at least one more O.
- **Letter Constraints**: Position 1 cannot be W (from W(-)), and position 3 cannot be O (from O(-) in Guess 4).
- **Combination Challenges**: Available letters are limited (~10), and common words are scarce due to the pattern and repeated O's. Possible candidates include:
  - ""HOWDY"": Tests H, O, W, D, Y. However, it has only one O, conflicting with the requirement for at least two O's.
  - ""WOOFY"": Tests W, O, O, F, Y. It fits the pattern (W at position 1—which must be misplaced per feedback), two O's (position 2 fixed, position 3 to test), and Y at position 5. This could reveal:
    - If W is in the word but not position 1, feedback will be W(-).
    - If the secret word has an additional O at position 3 or elsewhere, it will appear in feedback.
- **Why ""WOOFY""?**: Despite W at position 1 potentially being invalid per feedback, guessing ""WOOFY"" leverages:
  - **Position 4**: Tests F, a new common letter.
  - **Information Gain**: Confirms W (position or presence), the letter at position 4 (F), and resolves the second O location.
  - **Balanced Letters**: Uses high-frequency available consonants (W, F) and probes for the second O position.

### Decision:
- ""WOOFY"" is valid English (meaning wool-like) and respects the constraints. It is chosen to gather critical information on W, the second O, and position 4, with available letters.",Guess 5: woofy -> FEEDBACK: W(-) O(✓) O(-) F(x) Y(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,6,HOWDY,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" as it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). Also, it doesn't repeat letters.

 So, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": all letters are marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, we must avoid using any of these letters in our next guess.

 Since none of the letters in ""crane"" are in the secret word, we need to choose a word that uses entirely different letters.

 We should pick a word that uses other common letters to maximize the chance of hitting some in the secret word.

 Common letters in English 5-letter words (excluding C, R, A, N, E) might include: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, H, G, B, etc.

 A good second guess might be ""SLOTH"" or ""PIOUS"", but let's think of a word that uses as many common letters as possible without repeating and without using the excluded letters.

 Another popular starting word is ""SLATE"", but it uses A and E which are excluded. So we cannot use that.

 We can try ""MOIST"" or ""BUILD"", but let's list some words without C, R, A, N, E.

 Possible words: 
   - ""SLIMY"": uses S, L, I, M, Y -> but Y is less common at the end.
   - ""PLUMB"": but B is at the end and it's not very common, and also has a silent B.
   - ""LIGHT"": uses L, I, G, H, T -> common letters.

 However, we want to cover more common letters. Let's consider:

   - ""TOILS"": uses T, O, I, L, S -> all common.

 But we can do better. How about ""OUIJA""? That's not common and has a J which is rare.

 Another idea: ""PIOUS"" uses P, I, O, U, S. But U is less common.

 Alternatively, ""SHIFT"": uses S, H, I, F, T. F is somewhat common.

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Let me think of a word that uses T, O, S, L, I. But we can't use all in one word because it's 5 letters.

 The word ""SLIPT"" is not common. ""SPILT"" is a word: S, P, I, L, T.

 However, we can use ""SPLIT"": S, P, L, I, T. That's a good word.

 But wait, we have to avoid the letters C, R, A, N, E. ""SPLIT"" does not contain any of these.

 So, I choose ""SPLIT"" as the next guess.

<guess>split</guess>After the first guess ""crane"" received all ""x"" feedback, we know the secret word contains none of the letters: C, R, A, N, or E. For the next guess, we need a word that uses entirely new letters to maximize information. Common English letters not yet tested include S, T, L, I, P, O, U, M, D, G, B, H, Y, etc. 

A strong second guess should:
- Use high-frequency letters to increase hit probability
- Avoid repeating excluded letters (C, R, A, N, E)
- Cover new vowel/consonant combinations

""**PIOUS**"" fits well:
- Contains P, I, O, U, S – all common letters not previously used
- Tests two vowels (I, O, U) and three consonants
- Is a valid 5-letter word

This choice efficiently probes new letter combinations while adhering to the feedback constraints.

<guess>split</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: split -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) L(x) I(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters wrong: C, R, A, N, E are not in the secret word.
2. ""split"" -> all letters wrong: S, P, L, I, T are not in the secret word.

So now we know that the secret word does not contain any of these letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, L, I, T.

We need to choose a new word that avoids all these letters and uses new letters.

Available letters: We've excluded 10 letters. The English alphabet has 26 letters, so we have 16 letters left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should choose a word that uses common letters from these remaining ones to maximize the chance of hitting the secret word.

Common letters among the remaining: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, U, V, W, Y. Letters like J, Q, X, Z are less common.

We aim for a word that uses as many common letters as possible without repeating and without using excluded letters.

Some possible words:

- ""MOUND"" but we excluded D? Let's check: D is still available.
  Actually, we haven't excluded D. Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,L,I,T. So D is available.

Potential words:
- ""MOLDY"" but L is excluded and O is available? Wait, we excluded L? Yes, from ""split"", L is excluded. So cannot use L.

Let's list available letters again: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, let's think of words using these letters.

Common combinations: 
- Words like ""FUDGY"" but F, U, D, G, Y? But we need valid 5-letter words.
- ""GOUGE"" uses G, O, U, G, E? But E is excluded. So no.
- ""HUMOR"" but H, U, M, O, R? But R is excluded? R was excluded from ""crane"", so cannot use R.

We have to be cautious.

Another idea: ""BUGGY"" but has double G? And Y. But let's think of words without repeated letters.

Better: ""MOUND"" - M, O, U, N, D? But N is excluded? From ""crane"", N is excluded. So no.

We need to avoid: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,L,I,T.

So word? How about ""JUMBO""? J, U, M, B, O. All available? 
- J is less common, but available.
- U: available
- M: available
- B: available
- O: available

But ""JUMBO"" is a valid word? Yes, it means large, like in jumbo jet.

Another possibility: ""FUDGY"" has D, G, Y, and F, U. But D, F, G are available? Yes.

But let's see common letters: We want to cover vowels too? O and U are vowels available.

A better choice might be a word with O and U, plus consonants like B, D, F, G, H, K, M.

Try ""FOUGH"" or ""MIGHT""? But we don't have G,H. How about ""HUMOR""? H, U, M, O, R? But R is excluded.

Cannot use R.

What about ""BOUGH"": B, O, U, G, H. All letters available? 
- B: yes
- O: yes
- U: yes
- G: yes
- H: yes
And ""BOUGH"" is a word meaning a tree branch.

Another: ""DOUGH"" D, O, U, G, H? D is available, so yes.

But we might want more common consonants? How common is D? Pretty common.

But note: Both ""JUMBO"" and ""BOUGH"" use common letters. ""JUMBO"" has M and B, which are good.

Alternatively, ""MUCKY""? M, U, C, K, Y? C is excluded? Yes, C is from ""crane"", excluded. So no.

""BUGGY"" has G and Y, but repeated G? Not ideal.

Best option: ""JUMBO"" uses J,U,M,B,O. While J is less common, the others are good. But perhaps we can avoid J.

Let me try to find a word without J.

""WOUND"" but W, O, U, N, D? N is excluded? From ""crane"", N is excluded. So no.

""YOUTH""? Y, O, U, T, H? T is excluded? From ""split"", T is excluded. So no.

""CHILD"" but C and H? C excluded. No.

We need to stick to letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Consider ""FOAMY""? F, O, A, M, Y? A is excluded. No.

""FOGGY""? F, O, G, G, Y? Repeated G? Not great.

""MOUTH""? M, O, U, T, H? T excluded? Yes, from ""split"". So no.

""VOUCH""? V, O, U, C, H? C excluded? Yes.

""QUOTH""? Q, U, O, T, H? T excluded? Yes.

So perhaps ""JUMBO"" is acceptable? But J is rare. Alternatively, ""BODYWORK"" not 5 letters.

Another word: ""GUMBO"" G, U, M, B, O? But ""GUMBO"" is a word?! Let me check: Yes, gumbo is a stew. And letters: G,U,M,B,O. All available? 
- G: yes
- U: yes
- M: yes
- B: yes
- O: yes

Perfect! And it avoids J, which is less common.

So ""GUMBO"" is better than ""JUMBO"" because it uses G instead of J.

Therefore, I choose ""GUMBO"".

We might get hits on some of these letters.

<guess>gumbo</guess>After two guesses with all letters incorrect, the excluded letters are: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, L, I, T. The secret word must consist of letters from the remaining 16: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. 

For the third guess, ""gumbo"" is chosen because:
- It uses common letters G, U, M, B, O (avoiding rare letters like J, Q, X, Z).
- It tests new vowels (O, U) and consonants (G, M, B).
- It maximizes information potential by covering high-frequency combinations.

<guess>gumbo</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: split -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) L(x) I(x) T(x)
Guess 3: gumbo -> FEEDBACK: G(x) U(x) M(x) B(x) O(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from three guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters wrong: excluded C, R, A, N, E.
2. ""split"" -> all letters wrong: excluded S, P, L, I, T.
3. ""gumbo"" -> feedback: G(x), U(x), M(x), B(x), O(-)

So, O is present in the secret word but not at the last position (since in ""gumbo"", O is the fifth letter, and it's marked as '-', meaning present but wrong position).

Now, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter O, but not as the fifth letter.
- Excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,L,I,T,G,U,M,B.
- Since O is in the word, we must keep O in our next guess, but not at the end.

We need to consider the available letters: the English alphabet without excluded letters.

Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,L,I,T,G,U,M,B -> 14 letters excluded.

Available: D, F, H, J, K, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (12 letters). But note: O is included and must be used.

But O is included and must be present in the word, and we know O is not the last letter.

Now, we have 12 available letters: D, F, H, J, K, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a 5-letter word using these letters, and it must include O (but not at position 5).

Since O is the only vowel left? Wait, we have U excluded? Yes, U is excluded from ""gumbo"". So no other vowels? Unless we consider Y as vowel.

Available vowels: O and Y (if Y can be used as vowel), and sometimes W? But typically, we need vowels. So O is confirmed, then Y might be used as vowel.

But with such constrained letters, finding a word might be challenging.

List of possible words:

We have 12 letters: D,F,H,J,K,O,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Possible words that include O and are 5 letters:

- ""JOKED"": but E is excluded? E is from ""crane"", excluded. So no.

- ""FOXED"": but F,O,X,E,D? E excluded? Yes, cannot use E. Also, we haven't excluded D? D is still available? In the available list I have D.

Remember we excluded: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,L,I,T,G,U,M,B.

So D, F, H, J, K, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z are available.

But ""FOXED"" uses F,O,X,E,D? E is excluded? Yes, E is excluded. So invalid.

- ""HOOKY"": H,O,O,K,Y? But repeated O? And not a big issue, but we should avoid repeats if possible? However, it's allowed. Let me check: ""HOOKY"" is a word (meaning truant). But note, O is repeated, but that's okay.

In ""HOOKY"", O is at positions 2 and 3. We know O is not at the 5th position, which is okay since the last letter of ""HOOKY"" is Y.

But the feedback from ""gumbo"" only told us that O is in the word but not at 5th position. It doesn't tell us how many times O appears. It could appear multiple times.

But in our guess, we want to test new letters.

Which letters have not been excluded? From the 12 available.

Now, ""HOOKY"" uses H, O, O, K, Y. So letters: H,O,K,Y (and O repeated). We are testing H,K,Y, and O (again).

But O is for position, so that might be okay.

Another idea: ""FJORD""? F,J,O,R,D? But R is excluded? R is from ""crane"", excluded. So no.

""VODKA"": V,O,D,K,A? A is excluded? From ""crane"", A is excluded. So no.

""WOKEN"": W,O,K,E,N? E and N excluded? Both excluded. No.

""YOUTH"": Y,O,U,T,H? U and T excluded? Yes, from previous. U from ""gumbo"", T from ""split"".

So ""YOUTH"" uses U and T which are excluded? Invalid.

""WHOOP"": W,H,O,O,P? P excluded? From ""split"", P is excluded. So no.

""KOJOU""? ""KOJOU"" not common.

What about ""JOWLY"": J,O,W,L,Y? L excluded? From ""split"", L is excluded. So no.

""YOWED"": Y,O,W,E,D? E excluded? Yes.

""OZZY""? Only 4 letters.

This is difficult. Let me think of words with O and available consonants.

How about ""DOXIV""? Not a word.

""HOMME""? Not English, and has M, which is excluded? M excluded from ""gumbo"". Wait, M is excluded? Yes.

Another idea: ""DOZHY""? Not a word.

Perhaps we must use Y as vowel.

Consider: ""JOLLY""? But L excluded? L from ""split"" excluded.

So how about ""JO"" with something? Not.

""FOYER"": F,O,Y,E,R? E and R excluded? Both excluded. No.

This is hard. Maybe ""BOXED"": but E excluded? ""BOXED"" has E? No, ""BOXED"": B,O,X,E,D? But B is excluded from ""gumbo"", and E is excluded. Double exclusion.

But let's list words from available letters: D,F,H,J,K,O,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Possible words:
- ""HOYDEN"": but 6 letters? We need 5 letters.

5 letter words:

- ""DORKY""? D,O,R,K,Y? R excluded? Yes.

- ""FORKY""? F,O,R,K,Y? R excluded.

- ""HOKEY"": H,O,K,E,Y? E excluded? Yes.

- ""JOKEY"": J,O,K,E,Y? E excluded.

- ""KHOTY""? Not word.

- ""VOZHD""? Not word.

- ""WOOZY"": W,O,O,Z,Y? Has double O? But allowed. Let me check if it's valid: ""WOOZY"" is a word (meaning dizzy). Letters: W, O, O, Z, Y.

Available? W: yes, O: yes, Z: yes, Y: yes. And does not use any excluded letters? Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,L,I,T,G,U,M,B. None of W,O,Z,Y in excluded? Correct.

So ""WOOZY"" is a candidate.

But note: O is at positions 2 and 3? And not at 5? The last letter is Y, so O is not at position 5? Correct. We know O must be present, so we include it. The word ends with Y.

Now, this tests W, O, O, Z, Y. So new letters: W, Z, Y. And we know O is tested again? But we are also testing positions.

Another possibility? ""DOBBY""? But B and D? But B is excluded? From ""gumbo"", B is excluded. And ""DOBBY"" has B? No, ""DOBBY"" uses B, which is excluded.

How about ""DOOZY""? Similar? ""DOOZY"" has Z? Let me check: ""DOOZY"" is a word. Letters: D, O, O, Z, Y? Available: D, O, Z, Y? Yes. We can use D.

But compared to ""WOOZY"", both are possible? ""DOOZY"" uses D instead of W.

Which letters are more common? In English, D is more common than W? So testing D is good? But W is also common.

Another option? ""FOODY""? F,O,O,D,Y? But F, O, D, Y available? Yes. Is ""FOODY"" a word? It might be informal? Or food-related? Probably accepted.

But ""WOOZY"" seems standard.

Alternatively, ""ZOBO"": only 4 letters.

""OOZED"": O,O,Z,E,D? E excluded? Yes.

So ""WOOZY"" or ""DOOZY"".

Let me check ""DOOZY"": it is a valid word meaning something excellent. And ""WOOZY"" meaning dizzy.

Both fine.

But note: in ""gumbo"", O was in position 5 and found not to be there? Now in ""WOOZY"", we put O at positions 2 and 3, not 1 or 4 or 5? Position 5 is Y, so okay.

But we might want to test different positions? For example, put O at the beginning? But we don't know.

In ""WOOZY"", O is at positions 2 and 3? That might be okay.

Another word: ""JOCKY""? J,O,C,K,Y? C excluded? Yes.

Not.

""ZOWIE"": Z,O,W,I,E? I and E excluded? Yes.

No.

So perhaps ""WOOZY"" is fine.

But we have Q available? ""OQUET""? Not a word.

""TOQUE""? T excluded? Yes.

So best bet is ""WOOZY"" or ""DOOZY"".

I think ""WOOZY"" is a reasonable choice.

But let's think: we might want to avoid double letters? But Wordle allows double letters, and the feedback will tell.

Note: we have to include O, and from available letters, it's hard.

Another word: ""BOXTY""? B and T excluded? B excluded, T excluded.

""HYDRO""? H,Y,D,R,O? R excluded.

No.

Therefore, I think ""WOOZY"" is acceptable.

So I choose ""WOOZY"".

We have to remember that the word must contain O, so ""WOOZY"" has O.

If we guess ""WOOZY"", and if O is in the word, it will show as '-' for O if in wrong position, or '✓' if correct.

But in this case, we know O is in the word, but we don't know positions.

The goal is to get more information.

Alternatively, we can try ""HOOKY""? But H,O,O,K,Y? K and Y available? Yes. ""HOOKY"" is valid.

But ""HOOKY"" uses H,K,Y, while ""WOOZY"" uses W,Z,Y? So different.

Both test letters we haven't tried.

But W and Z versus H and K? H and K are more common? Actually, W, H, K, Y, Z: all are not very high frequency but we have limited choices.

I think ""HOOKY"" might be better because it doesn't have Z, which is less common? But Z is possible.

Or we can choose ""HOOKY"" to preserve letters like D,Z for later.

But I think it's fine.

Let's go with ""WOOZY"" for now.

But note: we only have 12 available letters, and we must use O. So testing multiple O's is okay if the word has repeats.

So guess: ""WOOZY""

<guess>woozy</guess>After analyzing the feedback:
- **Guess 1 (""crane""):** All letters incorrect → C, R, A, N, E excluded.
- **Guess 2 (""split""):** All letters incorrect → S, P, L, I, T excluded.
- **Guess 3 (""gumbo""):** G, U, M, B incorrect → excluded. O present but in wrong position → O must appear in the secret word, but not at the fifth position.

**Excluded letters (14 total):** C, R, A, N, E, S, P, L, I, T, G, U, M, B.  
**Available letters (12 total):** D, F, H, J, K, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
**Key constraint:** O must be in the word (not at position 5).

For the next guess:
- Must include O to verify its position.
- Avoid excluded letters; prioritize common consonants like D, F, H, K, W, Y, and Z where possible.
- Words are scarce due to limited vowel options (O is the only common vowel available; Y may act as a vowel).
- ""WOOZY"" (meaning dizzy) is valid:
  - Contains O (required) and avoids position 5.
  - Tests new letters: W, Z, Y.
  - Double O is acceptable—can reveal if O appears multiple times in the secret word.
  - Other options like ""DOOZY"" or ""HOOKY"" were considered, but ""WOOZY"" balances letter coverage and commonality.

This guess maximizes positional information for O and probes several high-likelihood consonants.

<guess>woozy</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: split -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) L(x) I(x) T(x)
Guess 3: gumbo -> FEEDBACK: G(x) U(x) M(x) B(x) O(-)
Guess 4: woozy -> FEEDBACK: W(-) O(✓) O(-) Z(x) Y(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from four guesses:
1. ""crane"": All x → excluded C, R, A, N, E.
2. ""split"": All x → excluded S, P, L, I, T.
3. ""gumbo"": G(x), U(x), M(x), B(x), O(-) → O is in word but not at position 5; exclude G,U,M,B.
4. ""woozy"": W(-), O(✓), O(-), Z(x), Y(✓)

Feedback for ""woozy"":
- W(-): W is in word but not at position 1.
- First O(✓): O is at position 2 (correct).
- Second O(-): Since we already know O is at position 2, and the second O is at position 3, marked '-', which means there's another O in the word? Or it could be the same O?
  But note: in Wordle, if you guess a letter multiple times, and the word has only one instance, the feedback will mark one as correct or misplaced and the others as wrong if they exceed the count.

But here, the secret word must have at least two O's? Because the first O is marked ✓ (so position 2 is O), and the second O is marked '-' (meaning it's in the word but not at position 3). So if there were only one O, the second O would be marked 'x'. But since it's marked '-', there must be at least one more O in the secret word at a different position.

So, secret word has at least two O's. And from feedback:
- Position 2 is O (from O(✓)).
- There's another O somewhere else, but not at position 3 (since the second O is '-' and not at position 3).

Also:
- Y(✓): Y is at position 5 (correct).
- W(-): W is in the word but not at position 1.
- Z(x): Z is not in the word → exclude Z.

Moreover, Y must be at the end? Because Y(✓) at position 5? Wait: in ""woozy"", Y is at position 5? And marked ✓? So yes, position 5 is Y.

Therefore, we know:
- Position 2 is O.
- Position 5 is Y.
- At least one more O in the word (positions unknown).
- W is in the word but not at position 1.

And the full secret word pattern: _ O _ _ Y

Now, from exclusion, we have excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,L,I,T,G,U,M,B,Z.

Available letters: D,F,H,J,K,O,Q,V,W,X, and note O is already present twice? Wait, but we can use O again? However, we also have W.

Since we have W in the word but not position 1?

Now, the secret word must have:
- At least two O's: one fixed at position 2.
- W somewhere not at 1? Positions available: 1,3,4? But not 2 and 5? Position 2 is O, position 5 is Y. So positions 1,3,4 are open.

We also know that the word must have not at position 1? So W can be at 3 or 4.

And the remaining letters: we have two positions to fill (1,3,4) but three positions? Actually, positions: 1, 3, 4.

But we have at least one more O to place? And possibly W, plus another letter? Since we have three positions.

Structure: Letter1, O (position 2), Letter3, Letter4, Y (position 5).

And the word must contain at least two O's? Position 2 is one O, so positions 1,3, or 4 must have at least one O.

Also, W is in the word? But W can be at position 3 or 4? But W could also be at position 1? But wait: in ""woozy"" feedback, W is marked '-' meaning present but not at 1? So since it's position 1 in our guess was wrong, meaning W cannot be at position 1? So W must be at position 3 or 4.

Therefore:
- Position 1: cannot be W? But must be one of remaining letters? Not W? And not excluded.

Available letters: D,F,H,J,K,O,Q,V,W,X (and O,W are confirmed to be in).

But we also have at least one more O and W in the positions, so we need to use letters including O and W for positions 1,3,4? But position 1 cannot be W? So position 1 must be one of D,F,H,J,K,O,Q,V,X (but Q,V,X are less likely).

Now, we have to form a word with pattern _ O _ _ Y

With letters: We know O at 2, Y at 5, and we need at least one more O? And W in the word at 3 or 4.

But let's list the mandatory letters: O (at least two), Y (at position 5), W (somewhere).

Available letters: D,F,H,J,K,O,Q,V,W,X (since Z excluded).

And excluded: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,L,I,T,G,U,M,B,Z.

Now, possible words that fit the pattern? We'll guess the next word to uncover.

But we also note: in ""woozy"", the second O at position 3 was marked '-' meaning present but wrong position? Since we know position 3 is not O? So that O might be correctly at 2? But we already have that? Or? Wait, no: the word has two O's. The O at position 2 is ✓, meaning correct. The O at position 3 is in the word but wrong position? But if the word has only two O's, then position 3 is wrong? But since position 2 is already taken? Then the other O must be elsewhere? So positions: 1 or 4? So position 1 or 4 has an O.

Therefore, let's summarize:

Secret word structure:
Positions: 
1: ? 
2: O (fixed)
3: ? 
4: ? 
5: Y (fixed)

And the word contains:
+ At least one O at positions 1 or 4.
+ W at positions 3 or 4 (but not position 1).
+ Also, from ""gumbo"", O was present but not at 5, now we know O at 2? And possibly others.

Since O is at 2 and we have another O, so two O's? Unless more? But at least two.

Now, we need to guess a word that fits and tests possible letters.

Possible candidates:

Options for position 1: Cannot be W? And must be from available letters? And if position 1 is O? Then we have O at 1 and 2? But that's allowed.

Similarly, if position 4 is O.

But let's think of English words of form: ? O ? ? Y

With available letters: D,F,H,J,K,O,Q,V,W,X

And we must include W? And at least one more O? So in positions 1,3,4 we have the letters? With one being O? And W? And the other also?

Given the constraints:

Case 1: Position 1 is O.
Then word: O O ? ? Y
But then position 2 is O? So ""OO"" at beginning? And we need one more letter? Positions: 3 and 4? Must have W? And possibly another letter? But we have only two positions, so W must be one, and the other letter.

But words like ""OOWY""? Not English.

""OOLOGY""? Too long? 5 letters: O O L O G Y? But L excluded? So cannot.

""OOZ"" something? But OOZED? E excluded? And we already excluded.

""OOZLY"" not word.

So probably position 1 is not O? Then let's assume position 1 is not O? Then position 4 must be O? Because the second O must be somewhere? Since positions 2 and 5 fixed? So at position 4?

Then pattern: ? O _ O Y

And we must place W at position 3? Then: ? O W O Y

But what can position 1 be? Possible English words? Like ""DOW OY""? No.

""COW OY""? C excluded.

""HOW OY""? H O W O Y? ""HOWOY""? Not word.

""JOW OY""? J O W O Y? ""JOWOY""? Not word.

""VOWOY""? Not word.

""WOWOY""? W O W O Y? But then W at position 3, and let's check: H O W O Y? But no.

Another word? ""KOW TOW""? Not 5.

Perhaps ""DOX OY""? But Z excluded? Etc.

Maybe position 4 is O? And position 3 is W? Then we need position 1: ? O W O Y

Possible? With available letters: D,F,H,J,K,Q,V,X? But Q,V,X unlikely.

How about ""H O W O Y"" -> ""HOWOY""? Not valid.

""B O W O Y""? B excluded? B from gumbo excluded.

Another idea: perhaps the other O is at position 1? But we thought ""OO"" is hard? Maybe ""O O W Y something""? Not.

Perhaps the word has only two O's? But we need to place the second O.

Position 4 is O? But then W must be somewhere? If position 4 is O? Then position 1 and 3 available? And W must be at 3 or 4? But position 4 is O, so W at 3? So ? O W O Y

Now, position 1 can be: say H? ""HOW OY""? Not word.

D? ""DOW OY""? No.

F? ""FOW OY""? ""FOWOY""? No.

J? ""JOWOY""? No.

K? ""KOWOY""? No.

V? ""VOWOY""? No.

W? But position 1 cannot be W? From feedback: W not at 1.

Q? Not.

X? ""XOWOY""? Probably not.

So ? O W O Y: no valid word.

Then, perhaps position 1 is O? Then pattern O O _ _ Y

And then we need to fill positions 3 and 4? Must include W? And not O? Because we have two O's already? But could there be three O's? Possible? But if position 3 or 4 is O, that's fine? But we have to test.

From feedback of ""woozy"", the second O at position 3 was '-', meaning it's in the word but not at 3? So it could mean at position 4? Then in secret word, O at 2,4? Or at 1? But if position 1 is O? Then we have position 1 O, position 2 O, and we need another O at 4? Then three O's? Possible.

So structure: O O _ O Y? Then position 3 must be a letter? And W is in the word? So could be at position 3? Then ""O O W O Y""

But is ""OOWOY"" a word? Unlikely. Or any words?

Another possibility: position 3 could be something else? But let's list words: ""BOO K Y""? But B excluded, K not used? Etc.

Perhaps the word is ""JOLLY""? But L excluded.

Or ""WOOLY""? W,O,O,L,Y? But L excluded. No?

Perhaps positions: if position 1 is O, position 2 O, then position 3? say H, and position 4? Y? But position 5 is Y, so position 4 Y would be redundant? But "" O O H Y Y""? But only 5 letters? Positions: 1 O, 2 O, 3 H, 4 something, 5 Y? Oh, not two Y's? So position 4 can be another letter.

Candidates for position 3 and 4: must include W? But not necessarily? We must have W in the word? At position 3 or 4? And also position 4 could be O? Or not.

But we know from feedback that the secret word contains W? And the other O somewhere.

Let's assume the secret word has O at 2, Y at 5, and O at 1 or 4, and W at 3 or 4 (if not occupied by O).

But position 4 can be W or O? Or the other letter.

But from available letters, if position 1 is O, then positions 3 and 4: one must be W? But W must be in there? And the other could be O or another letter.

So possibilities:

If position 1 is O, then:
- Position 3: not O? Since in ""woozy"", position 3 O was marked '-' meaning not at 3? So position 3 cannot be O? For the secret word, position 3 is not O? Because if it were O, then in ""woozy"", guessing O at position 3 would be correct? But it was marked as '-', meaning present but wrong position? Which means that position 3 is not O in the secret word.

Therefore, the other O cannot be at position 3? So it must be at position 1 or 4.

Similarly, position 3 cannot be O? And position 5 is Y? So only positions 1 or 4 for the other O.

Now, we have position 1: if O, then we need position 4 to be not O? Or can be? But we have only two O's? Or more? But at least one more O.

But if position 1 is O, position 2 is O, position 5 Y, position 4 O would be three O's? Possible.

But positions: key is position 3 and 4: one of them must be W? And position 3 cannot be O? So if position 4 is O? Then position 3 must be W? Then ""O O W O Y""

But what is that? ""O O W O Y"" -> not a standard word.

Or position 1 is not O? Then position 4 must be O? And then position 1 must be something else? Available letter: D,F,H,J,K,Q,V,X? F,H,K possible? And position 3: must be W? Because W must be at 3 or 4? Position 4 is O, so W at position 3? Then pattern: ? O W O Y

And position 1: let's try. For example, ""H O W O Y"" -> ""HOW OY"" not word. ""D O W O Y"" -> ""DOW OY"" not. ""F O W O Y"" -> ""FOW OY"" not. ""J O W O Y"" -> ""JOW OY"" not. Etc.

So the only possibility is that position 1 is O? But then ""O O _ O Y""

But position 3 and4: position 3 cannot be O? We established earlier? So position 4 must be O? Then position 3 must be W? So ""O O W O Y"" which is not a word.

Contradiction? What's wrong?

Perhaps we misinterpreted the feedback. Let me double-check.

In guess 4: ""woozy"" -> W O O Z Y
Feedback: W(-), O(✓), O(-), Z(x), Y(✓)

So:
- W at position 1: '-' -> W is in the word but not at position 1.
- First O at position 2: '✓' -> letter and position correct.
- Second O at position 3: '-' -> this O is in the word but not at position 3. So the secret word has at least two O's? Or if only two, the other O is not at position 3? But since position 2 is already O, the other O must be at position 1 or 4 or 5? But position 5 is Y? Fixed? So position 1 or 4 must be O.

But as above.

Yet, ""bookworm"" is 8 letters.

Another idea: perhaps the secret word has only two O's? At position 2 and, say, position 4? Then in ""woozy"", the second O at position 3 is correct? But the feedback is '-' for position 3, meaning not correct position? So position 3 cannot be O? So secret word position 3 is not O.

So for position 3 in the secret word, it is not O? And not W? But W is in the word? So position 3 or 4 must be W? And position 1 or 4 must be O.

But position 4 cannot be both W and O? So it must be one or the other? Or the word has three letters: O, W, and another, to fill positions 1,3,4.

Available letters: D,F,H,J,K,O,Q,V,W,X.

But O and W are used.

Now, let's list possible words fitting pattern ? O ? ? Y

With letters for position 1,3,4 from available, including O and W.

Since the secret word has O at 2, Y at 5, and for the second O, it must be at 1 or 4.

Similarly, W must be at 3 or 4.

But position 4 cannot be both O and W? Unless it's OW or something? No, one letter per position.

So possible scenarios:

1. Position 1: O
   Then we need position 4 to be not O? or O? But if position 4 is O, then position 3 must be W? But ""O O W O Y"" not word.

   If position 1 is O, and position 4 is not O, then position 4 must be something else, and position 3 must be W? But we have no O in position 4? But we need another O? If position 1 is O, that's the second O? Then no need for position 4 to be O? But if only two O's, yes. So position 1 is O (second O), position 2 O, position 3 W, position 4 another letter, say H, position 5 Y? ""O O W H Y"" -> ""oowhy""? Not a word.

2. Position 1 is not O, so position 4 must be O.
   Then position 3 cannot be O? Position 3 must be W? Because W must be at 3 or 4? Position 4 is O, so W at 3? Then ""? O W O Y""
   Position 1 must be available letter: D,F,H,J,K,Q,V,X.

   Possible words: 
   - ""DOW OY"" not
   - ""FOW OY"" not
   - etc. as before.

So only possibility left is that the secret word has three O's!? Then position 1,2,4 are O? But position 3 must be W? Then ""O O W O Y"" -> ""oo o"" something.

But what English word is ""O O W O Y""? None.

Perhaps position 1 is W? But wait, we have feedback that W is '-' at position 1? So W cannot be at position 1? So it cannot be.

Another clue: in ""gumbo"", we had O at position 5 in guess, but secret word only at . position not 5? Now we have O at 2? So that's covered.

Perhaps the feedback for the O in ""woozy"" position 3 is '-' because the secret word has O at position 4, for example, and we only have two O's? Then the '-' at position 3 means that there is an O at some other position? But position 2 is already one O? So position 4 must be O? Then in secret word, positions: 2 and 4 are O.

Then structure: position 1: ? , position 2: O, position 3: ? , position 4: O, position 5: Y.

And W is in the word? Position 1 cannot be W? So position  must be W? Or position 3 must be W.

So if position 3 is W? Then ""? O W O Y""

If position 1 is letter, and position 3 is W? Then ""? O W O Y""

Possible words: if position 1 is ""H"", ""HOW OY"" not.

But maybe ""THYMY""? Not.

Perhaps "" JOWL Y""? But not 5 letters.

Another idea: ""rowlock"" not.

Perhaps we missed a word: ""HO  to something.

Let's search: 5-letter words ending in OY? Like ""coyer""? E excluded. ""employ"" E and excluded letters.

With available letters: ? O ? O Y

Position 1: D,F,H,J,K,Q,V,X

Position 3: must be a letter? And if we put W at position 3, then ""HOWOY"" not.

Other options for position 3: could be other letters, but we must have W in the word? So position 1 or 3 or 4 must be W? But position 4 is O? So position 1 or 3? But position 1 cannot be W? So position 3 must be W.

So required: position 3 must be W.

Then we have ""X O W O Y"" for position X at 1 with X in {D,F,H,J,K,Q,V,X}

None form valid words? For example, ""dow oy"" not.

Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that there might be three O's? Or the feedback is misinterpreted.

Perhaps the '-' for the second O in ""woozy"" does not mean an additional O? But in standard Wordle rules, it should.

But let's assume that the secret word is ""woo y"" with something.

Another possibility: the feedback means that for the second O, it is not position, but it is O and there is one more O somewhere else? But we have to place it.

Perhaps position 1 is 'W' but what? But feedback said W at position 1 is '-' so not there.

Let's think of available letters. Maybe ""DOWKY""? K excluded? But K is available.

But ""DOWKY"" is not common? Or ""JOCKY"" C excluded.

Perhaps ""DOWNY"": O,W,N,Y? But N excluded from ""crane"", so no.

""TOWNY"": T and N excluded.

 etc.

Let's list all possible 5-letter words with pattern ?O??Y, using available letters: D,Fet al.

For example, ""FOY "" no.

""HOY "" with double letter? ""HOYXY"" not.

Perhaps ""JOWAR"": J O W A R? But A and R excluded? No.

""DOVKY"" not word.

""VOWEL"": V O W E L? E and L excluded? No.

So no common words.

Perhaps it's ""goxes"" no.

Another idea: perhaps Y is not only at 5? In secret word, position 5 is Y, but other positions? But doesn't help.

Or we have not used Q? ""QOPHY"" not word.

Perhaps the word is ""oxyge"". not 5.

I think there's a mistake.

Perhaps in ""woozy"", the W at position 1 is '-' so W is in the word but not 1, and the O at position 2 is '✓' so O at 2, O at position 3 is '-' so there must be another O not at 3, and at position 4 we have Z which is x, so not, and Y at 5 is '✓' so Y at 5.

So secret word must have O at 2, Y at 5, W somewhere not 1, and at least one more O not at 3.

The only positions left are 1 or 4.

If position 4 is O, then the word is ? O ? O Y

With ? at 1 and ? at 3.

W is one of them, and not at 1? So W at position 3? Then ? O W O Y

But what can position 1 be? Let's try D: ""DOWOY"" - may be accepted as ""dow oy"" not, but perhaps ""dhow""? Not.

Perhaps ""KHOW"" not.

""SHOWY"": S,H,O,W,Y? But S and H? S excluded? From ""split"", S excluded? Yes. And position 2 O? But ""SHOWY"" has O at position 3? Not position 2.

Not.

Perhaps the word is ""ROWDY"": R,O,W,D,Y? R excluded? Yes.

No.

""GONGS"" not.

I think we have to consider that the available letters include H, and ""H O W O Y"" might be a typo, or we accept ""HOW OY"" as informal? But not.

Perhaps ""BOOZY"": but B excluded.

Or ""MOODY"": M and O excluded? M from gumbo excluded.

No.

Another thought: in ""gumbo"", O was at position 5, and marked '-', so secret word has O not at 5, but position 5 is now Y? Fixed.

Perhaps try a guess like ""dowly"" but L excluded.

I found a word: ""DOUBT"" but B and U excluded.

Not.

Perhaps ""FOX Y"" with different spelling? No.

With available letters, let's try ""WHOXY"" not.

Perhaps the secret word is ""WO AL Y"" no.

I think we need to guess a word that guesses the missing letters.

From pattern, we can guess:

For example, assume position 4 is O? Then pattern ? O ? O Y

Position 1: say H
Position 3: W -> ""H O W O Y"" not word.

Then try position 3: say D ? ""H O D O Y"" -> ""hod oy"" not.

Or position 1 F, position 3 D: ""F O D O Y"" -> ""fod oy"" not.

 Or ""J O K O Y"" -> ""jokoy"" not a word.

Or ""K O W O Y"" -> ""kow oy"" not.

 so perhaps position 4 is not O? Then position 1 must be O? Then pattern O O ? ? Y

Position 3: cannot be O? available letters for position 3: say W? So O O W ? Y

Position 4: must be a letter? say D: ""O O W D Y"" -> ""oowdy"" not word.

H: ""oowhy"" not.

K: ""oowky"" not.

So no.

Perhaps position 4 is O? O O ? O Y? Then position 3: a letter? say W: ""O O W O Y"" same as before.

 not.

I think there might be a word like ""woozy"" but with different? Or our earlier conclusion is correct? But no word.

Perhaps the feedback for the second O in ""woozy"" might be because the secret word has only one O? But then position 3 O should be 'x' if only one O? But it was '-', so at least two O's.

Yes.

Unless the secret word is ""woozy"" itself? But feedback was W(-), O(✓), O(-), Z(x), Y(✓) so secret word has O at 2 and Y at 5, but not Z, and W in the word but not at 1, and another O at different position? But ""woozy"" has O at position 2 and 3? But feedback says at position 3 O is '-', so if secret is ""woozy"", position 3 O would be '✓'? But it's not? So not ""woozy"".

For example, if secret is ""FOYER"", but many excluded.

No, secret word is unknown.

Perhaps positions: the secret word has O at position 4? For example, ""DOG OY"" not.

""JOG Y"" not.

Let's give up and guess a word that fits the pattern with available letters and includes W and O.

For example, guess ""HOWDY"" but D and Y? But feedback has Y at 5? But ""HOWDY"" has Y? ""HOWDY"" is H O W D Y? So position 2 O, position 5 Y, and W at position 3? Position 4 D.

But is ""HOWDY"" a word? Yes, meaning a greeting.

But what about the O count? In ""HOWDY"", only one O? At position 2? But we think there are two O's? In ""woozy"" feedback, the second O was '-', which would mean that there is another O in the secret word? But in ""HOWDY"" only one O, so for guess ""woozy"", if secret is ""HOWDY"", then:

- W at p1: secret word has W? Yes, at p3? So feedback should be '-' for W? Correct.
- First O at p2: secret has O at p2? Yes, so '✓' correct.
- Second O at p3: secret has no O at p3? And only one O? So should be 'x' because only one O and it's at p2? But in feedback it was '-', which would be wrong if only one O.

So if secret is ""HOWDY"", then for the second O in ""woozy"", since secret has only one O, it should be 'x'. But we got '-', so not.

Therefore, secret word must have at least two O's.

 similarly, if secret has two O's, then in ""woozy"", O at p3 is not present? Then it should be 'x' unless there are two O's and one is at p2, the other not at p3, so '-' means it is present elsewhere.

Back to square one.

Perhaps position 4 is O, and position p1 is a letter, and position p3 is not W? But what? Then let's assume the secret word does not have to have W? But from feedback in ""woozy"", W is '-' at p1, so must be in the word? Yes.

So we must have W somewhere.

So for position p3, must be W? As earlier. and position p4 O, and position p1? and no word.

Perhaps we overlooked a letter. Available letters include F,H,J,K, etc.

Make a guess like ""HO W O Y"" with position 1 H, position 2 O, position 3 W, position 4 O, position 5 Y: ""HOWOY"" or ""H O W O Y"".

If we guess it, feedback will tell.

But we risk.

Otherwise, we have only a few letters left.

List of available: D,F,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X,O,Y (but O and Y used)

For guess, we can try ""H O W O Y"" as ""howoy"", though it may not be valid, or choose.

Another word: ""DOFFY"" but F double? ""DoOff Y""? Not.

""YOWED"" E excluded.

Perhaps ""WOOFY"" W,O,O,F,Y? But position 1 W? But feedback from ""woozy"" W not at p1? So if we guess ""WOOFY"", position 1 W, but secret word W cannot be at 1, so if we guess W at 1, it will be marked '-' or 'x'? If secret W not at 1, then 'x' if not in word? But ' ' since present would be '-'.

But 'WOOFY' has O,O,F,W,Y? Pattern: position 2 and 3 are O? It would then have O at 2 and 3, but we need position 2 O fixed? Yes. Position 5 Y fixed. But then O at 3? But in previous feedback, position 3 O was marked '-' in ""woozy"", which means secret position 3 is not O? But in ""WOOFY"", if we guess, position 3 is O, which might be correct or not.

So to test, guess ""WOOFY"".

Position 1: W, position 2: O, position 3: O, position 4: F, position 5: Y.

But from available letters, F is available? Yes.

So <guess>woofy</guess>

Or better, guess ""HOWDY"" even though it might not have the O's.

But let's calculate the feedback.

For position 1: if secret W not at 1, then '-' if W present, or 'x' if not.

But it might be.

But to be systematic, we have few options.

Another common word? I recall ""roomy"" but R and M excluded.

So ""woofy"" is a word? Yes, meaning rich in wool or something.

And it has two O's? And W at 1, position fixed.

But position 1 is W? Which is not allowed? Because from feedback, W cannot be at position 1? But in guess, we can guess anything? The feedback will tell.

So for ""woofy"":

- Position 1 W: if secret W not at 1, then '-' (since W present elsewhere)
- Position 2 O: '✓' (since secret position 2 is O)
- Position 3 O: if secret position 3 is not O, and secret has only two O's at 2 and say 4, then '-' for position 3 O? Because O is present but not at 3.

Then position 4 F: we don't know.
Position 5 Y: '✓'

So it might give information.

So I'll go with ""WOOFY"".

<guess>woofy</guess> 

After all, we have to guess.

Or better, ""HOWDY"" with only one O, but if secret has two O's, it may be wrong, but we can guess.

But let's do ""WOOFY"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses and the constraints deduced, the analysis is as follows:

### Deductions from Feedback:
1. **Excluded Letters**: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, L, I, T, G, U, M, B, Z (from all ""x"" feedback).
2. **Confirmed Letters and Positions**: 
   - O is at position 2 (from Guess 4: ""woozy"" → O(✓)).
   - Y is at position 5 (from Guess 4: ""woozy"" → Y(✓)).
3. **Letters in Word but Wrong Position**: 
   - W is present in the word but not at position 1 (from Guess 4: ""woozy"" → W(-)).
   - The second O (from ""woozy"") is present but not at position 3. Combined with O(✓) at position 2, this confirms at least two O's in the word, with the second O not at position 3 (implying it could be at position 1 or 4).
4. **Remaining Available Letters**: D, F, H, J, K, O, Q, V, W, X.
5. **Word Pattern**: The secret word must be of the form _ O _ _ Y, with positions 1, 3, and 4 unknown, but must include W and at least one more O.

### Step-By-Step Reasoning:
- **Pattern Constraints**: The word must have the pattern ? O ? ? Y, with O at position 2 and Y at position 5. Positions 1, 3, and 4 must be filled using available letters, including W and at least one more O.
- **Letter Constraints**: Position 1 cannot be W (from W(-)), and position 3 cannot be O (from O(-) in Guess 4).
- **Combination Challenges**: Available letters are limited (~10), and common words are scarce due to the pattern and repeated O's. Possible candidates include:
  - ""HOWDY"": Tests H, O, W, D, Y. However, it has only one O, conflicting with the requirement for at least two O's.
  - ""WOOFY"": Tests W, O, O, F, Y. It fits the pattern (W at position 1—which must be misplaced per feedback), two O's (position 2 fixed, position 3 to test), and Y at position 5. This could reveal:
    - If W is in the word but not position 1, feedback will be W(-).
    - If the secret word has an additional O at position 3 or elsewhere, it will appear in feedback.
- **Why ""WOOFY""?**: Despite W at position 1 potentially being invalid per feedback, guessing ""WOOFY"" leverages:
  - **Position 4**: Tests F, a new common letter.
  - **Information Gain**: Confirms W (position or presence), the letter at position 4 (F), and resolves the second O location.
  - **Balanced Letters**: Uses high-frequency available consonants (W, F) and probes for the second O position.

### Decision:
- ""WOOFY"" is valid English (meaning wool-like) and respects the constraints. It is chosen to gather critical information on W, the second O, and position 4, with available letters.

""crane"" -> all letters wrong: C, R, A, N, E are not in the secret word.\n2.

The English alphabet has 26 letters, so we have 16 letters left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe should choose a word that uses common letters from these remaining ones to maximize the chance of hitting the secret word.\n\nCommon letters among the remaining: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, U, V, W, Y. Letters like J, Q, X, Z are less common.\n\nWe aim for a word that uses as many common letters as possible without repeating and without using excluded letters.\n\nSome possible words:\n\n- ""MOUND"" but we excluded D? Let\'s check: D is still available.\n  Actually, we haven\'t excluded D. Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,L,I,T. So D is available.\n\nPotential words:\n- ""MOLDY"" but L is excluded and O is available? Wait, we excluded L? Yes, from ""split"", L is excluded. So cannot use L.\n\nLet\'s list available letters again: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nNow, let\'s think of words using these letters.\n\nCommon combinations: \n- Words like ""FUDGY"" but F, U, D, G, Y? But we need valid 5-letter words.\n- ""GOUGE"" uses G, O, U, G, E? But E is excluded. So no.\n- ""HUMOR"" but H, U, M, O, R? But R is excluded? R was excluded from ""crane"", so cannot use R.\n\nWe have to be cautious.\n\nAnother idea: ""BUGGY"" but has double G? And Y. But let\'s think of words without repeated letters.\n\nBetter: ""MOUND"" - M, O, U, N, D? But N is excluded? From ""crane"", N is excluded. So no.\n\nWe need to avoid: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,L,I,T.\n\nSo word? How about ""JUMBO""? J, U, M, B, O. All available? \n- J is less common, but available.\n- U: available\n- M: available\n- B: available\n- O: available\n\nBut ""JUMBO"" is a valid word? Yes, it means large, like in jumbo jet.\n\nAnother possibility: ""FUDGY"" has D, G, Y, and F, U. But D, F, G are available? Yes.\n\nBut let\'s see common letters: We want to cover vowels too? O and U are vowels available.\n\nA better choice might be a word with O and U, plus consonants like B, D, F, G, H, K, M.\n\nTry ""FOUGH"" or ""MIGHT""? But we don\'t have G,H. How about ""HUMOR""? H, U, M, O, R? But R is excluded.\n\nCannot use R.\n\nWhat about ""BOUGH"": B, O, U, G, H. All letters available? \n- B: yes\n- O: yes\n- U: yes\n- G: yes\n- H: yes\nAnd ""BOUGH"" is a word meaning a tree branch.\n\nAnother: ""DOUGH"" D, O, U, G, H? D is available, so yes.\n\nBut we might want more common consonants? How common is D? Pretty common.\n\nBut note: Both ""JUMBO"" and ""BOUGH"" use common letters. ""JUMBO"" has M and B, which are good.\n\nAlternatively, ""MUCKY""? M, U, C, K, Y? C is excluded? Yes, C is from ""crane"", excluded. So no.\n\n""BUGGY"" has G and Y, but repeated G? Not ideal.\n\nBest option: ""JUMBO"" uses J,U,M,B,O. While J is less common, the others are good. But perhaps we can avoid J.\n\nLet me try to find a word without J.\n\n""WOUND"" but W, O, U, N, D? N is excluded? From ""crane"", N is excluded. So no.\n\n""YOUTH""? Y, O, U, T, H? T is excluded? From ""split"", T is excluded. So no.\n\n""CHILD"" but C and H? C excluded. No.\n\nWe need to stick to letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nConsider ""FOAMY""? F, O, A, M, Y? A is excluded. No.\n\n""FOGGY""? F, O, G, G, Y? Repeated G? Not great.\n\n""MOUTH""? M, O, U, T, H? T excluded? Yes, from ""split"". So no.\n\n""VOUCH""? V, O, U, C, H? C excluded? Yes.\n\n""QUOTH""? Q, U, O, T, H? T excluded? Yes.\n\nSo perhaps ""JUMBO"" is acceptable? But J is rare. Alternatively, ""BODYWORK"" not 5 letters.\n\nAnother word: ""GUMBO"" G, U, M, B, O? But ""GUMBO"" is a word?! Let me check: Yes, gumbo is a stew. And letters: G,U,M,B,O. All available? \n- G: yes\n- U: yes\n- M: yes\n- B: yes\n- O: yes\n\nPerfect! And it avoids J, which is less common.\n\nSo ""GUMBO"" is better than ""JUMBO"" because it uses G instead of J.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""GUMBO"".\n\nWe might get hits on some of these letters.\n\n<guess>gumbo</guess>After two guesses with all letters incorrect, the excluded letters are: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, L, I, T. The secret word must consist of letters from the remaining 16: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. \n\nFor the third guess, ""gumbo"" is chosen because:\n- It uses common letters G, U, M, B, O (avoiding rare letters like J, Q, X, Z).\n- It tests new vowels (O, U) and consonants (G, M, B).\n- It maximizes information potential by covering high-frequency combinations.\n\n<guess>gumbo</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: split -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) L(x) I(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: gumbo -> FEEDBACK: G(x) U(x) M(x) B(x) O(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n1.

But note: O is included and must be used.\n\nBut O is included and must be present in the word, and we know O is not the last letter.\n\nNow, we have 12 available letters: D, F, H, J, K, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word using these letters, and it must include O (but not at position 5).\n\nSince O is the only vowel left? Wait, we have U excluded? Yes, U is excluded from ""gumbo"". So no other vowels? Unless we consider Y as vowel.\n\nAvailable vowels: O and Y (if Y can be used as vowel), and sometimes W? But typically, we need vowels. So O is confirmed, then Y might be used as vowel.\n\nBut with such constrained letters, finding a word might be challenging.\n\nList of possible words:\n\nWe have 12 letters: D,F,H,J,K,O,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nPossible words that include O and are 5 letters:\n\n- ""JOKED"": but E is excluded? E is from ""crane"", excluded. So no.\n\n- ""FOXED"": but F,O,X,E,D? E excluded? Yes, cannot use E. Also, we haven\'t excluded D? D is still available? In the available list I have D.\n\nRemember we excluded: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,L,I,T,G,U,M,B.\n\nSo D, F, H, J, K, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z are available.\n\nBut ""FOXED"" uses F,O,X,E,D? E is excluded? Yes, E is excluded. So invalid.\n\n- ""HOOKY"": H,O,O,K,Y? But repeated O? And not a big issue, but we should avoid repeats if possible? However, it\'s allowed. Let me check: ""HOOKY"" is a word (meaning truant). But note, O is repeated, but that\'s okay.\n\nIn ""HOOKY"", O is at positions 2 and 3. We know O is not at the 5th position, which is okay since the last letter of ""HOOKY"" is Y.\n\nBut the feedback from ""gumbo"" only told us that O is in the word but not at 5th position. It doesn\'t tell us how many times O appears. It could appear multiple times.\n\nBut in our guess, we want to test new letters.\n\nWhich letters have not been excluded? From the 12 available.\n\nNow, ""HOOKY"" uses H, O, O, K, Y. So letters: H,O,K,Y (and O repeated). We are testing H,K,Y, and O (again).\n\nBut O is for position, so that might be okay.\n\nAnother idea: ""FJORD""? F,J,O,R,D? But R is excluded? R is from ""crane"", excluded. So no.\n\n""VODKA"": V,O,D,K,A? A is excluded? From ""crane"", A is excluded. So no.\n\n""WOKEN"": W,O,K,E,N? E and N excluded? Both excluded. No.\n\n""YOUTH"": Y,O,U,T,H? U and T excluded? Yes, from previous. U from ""gumbo"", T from ""split"".\n\nSo ""YOUTH"" uses U and T which are excluded? Invalid.\n\n""WHOOP"": W,H,O,O,P? P excluded? From ""split"", P is excluded. So no.\n\n""KOJOU""? ""KOJOU"" not common.\n\nWhat about ""JOWLY"": J,O,W,L,Y? L excluded? From ""split"", L is excluded. So no.\n\n""YOWED"": Y,O,W,E,D? E excluded? Yes.\n\n""OZZY""? Only 4 letters.\n\nThis is difficult. Let me think of words with O and available consonants.\n\nHow about ""DOXIV""? Not a word.\n\n""HOMME""? Not English, and has M, which is excluded? M excluded from ""gumbo"". Wait, M is excluded? Yes.\n\nAnother idea: ""DOZHY""? Not a word.\n\nPerhaps we must use Y as vowel.\n\nConsider: ""JOLLY""? But L excluded? L from ""split"" excluded.\n\nSo how about ""JO"" with something? Not.\n\n""FOYER"": F,O,Y,E,R? E and R excluded? Both excluded. No.\n\nThis is hard. Maybe ""BOXED"": but E excluded? ""BOXED"" has E? No, ""BOXED"": B,O,X,E,D? But B is excluded from ""gumbo"", and E is excluded. Double exclusion.\n\nBut let\'s list words from available letters: D,F,H,J,K,O,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""HOYDEN"": but 6 letters? We need 5 letters.\n\n5 letter words:\n\n- ""DORKY""? D,O,R,K,Y? R excluded? Yes.\n\n- ""FORKY""? F,O,R,K,Y? R excluded.\n\n- ""HOKEY"": H,O,K,E,Y? E excluded? Yes.\n\n- ""JOKEY"": J,O,K,E,Y? E excluded.\n\n- ""KHOTY""? Not word.\n\n- ""VOZHD""? Not word.\n\n- ""WOOZY"": W,O,O,Z,Y? Has double O? But allowed. Let me check if it\'s valid: ""WOOZY"" is a word (meaning dizzy). Letters: W, O, O, Z, Y.\n\nAvailable? W: yes, O: yes, Z: yes, Y: yes. And does not use any excluded letters? Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,L,I,T,G,U,M,B. None of W,O,Z,Y in excluded? Correct.\n\nSo ""WOOZY"" is a candidate.\n\nBut note: O is at positions 2 and 3? And not at 5? The last letter is Y, so O is not at position 5? Correct. We know O must be present, so we include it. The word ends with Y.\n\nNow, this tests W, O, O, Z, Y. So new letters: W, Z, Y. And we know O is tested again? But we are also testing positions.\n\nAnother possibility? ""DOBBY""? But B and D? But B is excluded? From ""gumbo"", B is excluded. And ""DOBBY"" has B? No, ""DOBBY"" uses B, which is excluded.\n\nHow about ""DOOZY""? Similar? ""DOOZY"" has Z? Let me check: ""DOOZY"" is a word. Letters: D, O, O, Z, Y? Available: D, O, Z, Y? Yes. We can use D.\n\nBut compared to ""WOOZY"", both are possible? ""DOOZY"" uses D instead of W.\n\nWhich letters are more common? In English, D is more common than W? So testing D is good? But W is also common.\n\nAnother option? ""FOODY""? F,O,O,D,Y? But F, O, D, Y available? Yes. Is ""FOODY"" a word? It might be informal? Or food-related? Probably accepted.\n\nBut ""WOOZY"" seems standard.\n\nAlternatively, ""ZOBO"": only 4 letters.\n\n""OOZED"": O,O,Z,E,D? E excluded? Yes.\n\nSo ""WOOZY"" or ""DOOZY"".\n\nLet me check ""DOOZY"": it is a valid word meaning something excellent. And ""WOOZY"" meaning dizzy.\n\nBoth fine.\n\nBut note: in ""gumbo"", O was in position 5 and found not to be there? Now in ""WOOZY"", we put O at positions 2 and 3, not 1 or 4 or 5? Position 5 is Y, so okay.\n\nBut we might want to test different positions? For example, put O at the beginning? But we don\'t know.\n\nIn ""WOOZY"", O is at positions 2 and 3? That might be okay.\n\nAnother word: ""JOCKY""? J,O,C,K,Y? C excluded? Yes.\n\nNot.\n\n""ZOWIE"": Z,O,W,I,E? I and E excluded? Yes.\n\nNo.\n\nSo perhaps ""WOOZY"" is fine.\n\nBut we have Q available? ""OQUET""? Not a word.\n\n""TOQUE""? T excluded? Yes.\n\nSo best bet is ""WOOZY"" or ""DOOZY"".\n\nI think ""WOOZY"" is a reasonable choice.\n\nBut let\'s think: we might want to avoid double letters? But Wordle allows double letters, and the feedback will tell.\n\nNote: we have to include O, and from available letters, it\'s hard.\n\nAnother word: ""BOXTY""? B and T excluded? B excluded, T excluded.\n\n""HYDRO""? H,Y,D,R,O? R excluded.\n\nNo.\n\nTherefore, I think ""WOOZY"" is acceptable.\n\nSo I choose ""WOOZY"".\n\nWe have to remember that the word must contain O, so ""WOOZY"" has O.\n\nIf we guess ""WOOZY"", and if O is in the word, it will show as \'-\' for O if in wrong position, or \'✓\' if correct.\n\nBut in this case, we know O is in the word, but we don\'t know positions.\n\nThe goal is to get more information.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""HOOKY""? But H,O,O,K,Y? K and Y available? Yes. ""HOOKY"" is valid.\n\nBut ""HOOKY"" uses H,K,Y, while ""WOOZY"" uses W,Z,Y? So different.\n\nBoth test letters we haven\'t tried.\n\nBut W and Z versus H and K? H and K are more common? Actually, W, H, K, Y, Z: all are not very high frequency but we have limited choices.\n\nI think ""HOOKY"" might be better because it doesn\'t have Z, which is less common? But Z is possible.\n\nOr we can choose ""HOOKY"" to preserve letters like D,Z for later.\n\nBut I think it\'s fine.\n\nLet\'s go with ""WOOZY"" for now.\n\nBut note: we only have 12 available letters, and we must use O. So testing multiple O\'s is okay if the word has repeats.\n\nSo guess: ""WOOZY""\n\n<guess>woozy</guess>After analyzing the feedback:\n- **Guess 1 (""crane""):** All letters incorrect → C, R, A, N, E excluded.\n- **Guess 2 (""split""):** All letters incorrect → S, P, L, I, T excluded.\n- **Guess 3 (""gumbo""):** G, U, M, B incorrect → excluded.

Or it could be the same O?\n  But note: in Wordle, if you guess a letter multiple times, and the word has only one instance, the feedback will mark one as correct or misplaced and the others as wrong if they exceed the count.\n\nBut here, the secret word must have at least two O\'s? Because the first O is marked ✓ (so position 2 is O), and the second O is marked \'-\' (meaning it\'s in the word but not at position 3). So if there were only one O, the second O would be marked \'x\'. But since it\'s marked \'-\', there must be at least one more O in the secret word at a different position.\n\nSo, secret word has at least two O\'s. And from feedback:\n- Position 2 is O (from O(✓)).\n- There\'s another O somewhere else, but not at position 3 (since the second O is \'-\' and not at position 3).\n\nAlso:\n- Y(✓): Y is at position 5 (correct).\n- W(-): W is in the word but not at position 1.\n- Z(x): Z is not in the word → exclude Z.\n\nMoreover, Y must be at the end?

Wait, but we can use O again? However, we also have W.\n\nSince we have W in the word but not position 1?\n\nNow, the secret word must have:\n- At least two O\'s: one fixed at position 2.\n- W somewhere not at 1? Positions available: 1,3,4? But not 2 and 5? Position 2 is O, position 5 is Y. So positions 1,3,4 are open.\n\nWe also know that the word must have not at position 1? So W can be at 3 or 4.\n\nAnd the remaining letters: we have two positions to fill (1,3,4) but three positions? Actually, positions: 1, 3, 4.\n\nBut we have at least one more O to place? And possibly W, plus another letter? Since we have three positions.\n\nStructure: Letter1, O (position 2), Letter3, Letter4, Y (position 5).\n\nAnd the word must contain at least two O\'s? Position 2 is one O, so positions 1,3, or 4 must have at least one O.\n\nAlso, W is in the word? But W can be at position 3 or 4? But W could also be at position 1? But wait: in ""woozy"" feedback, W is marked \'-\' meaning present but not at 1? So since it\'s position 1 in our guess was wrong, meaning W cannot be at position 1? So W must be at position 3 or 4.\n\nTherefore:\n- Position 1: cannot be W? But must be one of remaining letters? Not W? And not excluded.\n\nAvailable letters: D,F,H,J,K,O,Q,V,W,X (and O,W are confirmed to be in).\n\nBut we also have at least one more O and W in the positions, so we need to use letters including O and W for positions 1,3,4? But position 1 cannot be W? So position 1 must be one of D,F,H,J,K,O,Q,V,X (but Q,V,X are less likely).\n\nNow, we have to form a word with pattern _ O _ _ Y\n\nWith letters: We know O at 2, Y at 5, and we need at least one more O? And W in the word at 3 or 4.\n\nBut let\'s list the mandatory letters: O (at least two), Y (at position 5), W (somewhere).\n\nAvailable letters: D,F,H,J,K,O,Q,V,W,X (since Z excluded).\n\nAnd excluded: C,R,A,N,E,S,P,L,I,T,G,U,M,B,Z.\n\nNow, possible words that fit the pattern? We\'ll guess the next word to uncover.\n\nBut we also note: in ""woozy"", the second O at position 3 was marked \'-\' meaning present but wrong position? Since we know position 3 is not O? So that O might be correctly at 2? But we already have that? Or? Wait, no: the word has two O\'s. The O at position 2 is ✓, meaning correct. The O at position 3 is in the word but wrong position? But if the word has only two O\'s, then position 3 is wrong? But since position 2 is already taken? Then the other O must be elsewhere? So positions: 1 or 4? So position 1 or 4 has an O.\n\nTherefore, let\'s summarize:\n\nSecret word structure:\nPositions: \n1: ? \n2: O (fixed)\n3: ? \n4: ? \n5: Y (fixed)\n\nAnd the word contains:\n+ At least one O at positions 1 or 4.\n+ W at positions 3 or 4 (but not position 1).\n+ Also, from ""gumbo"", O was present but not at 5, now we know O at 2? And possibly others.\n\nSince O is at 2 and we have another O, so two O\'s? Unless more? But at least two.\n\nNow, we need to guess a word that fits and tests possible letters.\n\nPossible candidates:\n\nOptions for position 1: Cannot be W? And must be from available letters? And if position 1 is O? Then we have O at 1 and 2? But that\'s allowed.\n\nSimilarly, if position 4 is O.\n\nBut let\'s think of English words of form: ? O ? ? Y\n\nWith available letters: D,F,H,J,K,O,Q,V,W,X\n\nAnd we must include W? And at least one more O? So in positions 1,3,4 we have the letters? With one being O? And W? And the other also?\n\nGiven the constraints:\n\nCase 1: Position 1 is O.\nThen word: O O ? ? Y\nBut then position 2 is O? So ""OO"" at beginning? And we need one more letter? Positions: 3 and 4? Must have W? And possibly another letter? But we have only two positions, so W must be one, and the other letter.\n\nBut words like ""OOWY""? Not English.\n\n""OOLOGY""? Too long? 5 letters: O O L O G Y? But L excluded? So cannot.\n\n""OOZ"" something? But OOZED? E excluded? And we already excluded.\n\n""OOZLY"" not word.\n\nSo probably position 1 is not O? Then let\'s assume position 1 is not O? Then position 4 must be O? Because the second O must be somewhere? Since positions 2 and 5 fixed? So at position 4?\n\nThen pattern: ? O _ O Y\n\nAnd we must place W at position 3? Then: ? O W O Y\n\nBut what can position 1 be? Possible English words? Like ""DOW OY""? No.\n\n""COW OY""? C excluded.\n\n""HOW OY""? H O W O Y? ""HOWOY""? Not word.\n\n""JOW OY""? J O W O Y? ""JOWOY""? Not word.\n\n""VOWOY""? Not word.\n\n""WOWOY""? W O W O Y? But then W at position 3, and let\'s check: H O W O Y? But no.\n\nAnother word? ""KOW TOW""? Not 5.\n\nPerhaps ""DOX OY""? But Z excluded? Etc.\n\nMaybe position 4 is O? And position 3 is W? Then we need position 1: ? O W O Y\n\nPossible? With available letters: D,F,H,J,K,Q,V,X? But Q,V,X unlikely.\n\nHow about ""H O W O Y"" -> ""HOWOY""? Not valid.\n\n""B O W O Y""? B excluded? B from gumbo excluded.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the other O is at position 1? But we thought ""OO"" is hard? Maybe ""O O W Y something""? Not.\n\nPerhaps the word has only two O\'s? But we need to place the second O.\n\nPosition 4 is O? But then W must be somewhere? If position 4 is O? Then position 1 and 3 available? And W must be at 3 or 4? But position 4 is O, so W at 3? So ? O W O Y\n\nNow, position 1 can be: say H? ""HOW OY""? Not word.\n\nD? ""DOW OY""? No.\n\nF? ""FOW OY""? ""FOWOY""? No.\n\nJ? ""JOWOY""? No.\n\nK? ""KOWOY""? No.\n\nV? ""VOWOY""? No.\n\nW? But position 1 cannot be W? From feedback: W not at 1.\n\nQ? Not.\n\nX? ""XOWOY""? Probably not.\n\nSo ? O W O Y: no valid word.\n\nThen, perhaps position 1 is O? Then pattern O O _ _ Y\n\nAnd then we need to fill positions 3 and 4? Must include W? And not O? Because we have two O\'s already? But could there be three O\'s? Possible? But if position 3 or 4 is O, that\'s fine? But we have to test.\n\nFrom feedback of ""woozy"", the second O at position 3 was \'-\', meaning it\'s in the word but not at 3? So it could mean at position 4? Then in secret word, O at 2,4? Or at 1? But if position 1 is O? Then we have position 1 O, position 2 O, and we need another O at 4? Then three O\'s? Possible.\n\nSo structure: O O _ O Y? Then position 3 must be a letter? And W is in the word? So could be at position 3? Then ""O O W O Y""\n\nBut is ""OOWOY"" a word? Unlikely. Or any words?\n\nAnother possibility: position 3 could be something else? But let\'s list words: ""BOO K Y""? But B excluded, K not used? Etc.\n\nPerhaps the word is ""JOLLY""? But L excluded.\n\nOr ""WOOLY""? W,O,O,L,Y? But L excluded. No?\n\nPerhaps positions: if position 1 is O, position 2 O, then position 3? say H, and position 4? Y? But position 5 is Y, so position 4 Y would be redundant? But "" O O H Y Y""? But only 5 letters? Positions: 1 O, 2 O, 3 H, 4 something, 5 Y? Oh, not two Y\'s? So position 4 can be another letter.\n\nCandidates for position 3 and 4: must include W? But not necessarily? We must have W in the word? At position 3 or 4? And also position 4 could be O? Or not.\n\nBut we know from feedback that the secret word contains W? And the other O somewhere.\n\nLet\'s assume the secret word has O at 2, Y at 5, and O at 1 or 4, and W at 3 or 4 (if not occupied by O).\n\nBut position 4 can be W or O? Or the other letter.\n\nBut from available letters, if position 1 is O, then positions 3 and 4: one must be W? But W must be in there? And the other could be O or another letter.\n\nSo possibilities:\n\nIf position 1 is O, then:\n- Position 3: not O? Since in ""woozy"", position 3 O was marked \'-\' meaning not at 3? So position 3 cannot be O? For the secret word, position 3 is not O? Because if it were O, then in ""woozy"", guessing O at position 3 would be correct? But it was marked as \'-\', meaning present but wrong position? Which means that position 3 is not O in the secret word.\n\nTherefore, the other O cannot be at position 3? So it must be at position 1 or 4.\n\nSimilarly, position 3 cannot be O? And position 5 is Y? So only positions 1 or 4 for the other O.\n\nNow, we have position 1: if O, then we need position 4 to be not O? Or can be? But we have only two O\'s? Or more? But at least one more O.\n\nBut if position 1 is O, position 2 is O, position 5 Y, position 4 O would be three O\'s? Possible.\n\nBut positions: key is position 3 and 4: one of them must be W? And position 3 cannot be O? So if position 4 is O? Then position 3 must be W? Then ""O O W O Y""\n\nBut what is that? ""O O W O Y"" -> not a standard word.\n\nOr position 1 is not O? Then position 4 must be O? And then position 1 must be something else? Available letter: D,F,H,J,K,Q,V,X? F,H,K possible? And position 3: must be W? Because W must be at 3 or 4? Position 4 is O, so W at position 3? Then pattern: ? O W O Y\n\nAnd position 1: let\'s try. For example, ""H O W O Y"" -> ""HOW OY"" not word. ""D O W O Y"" -> ""DOW OY"" not. ""F O W O Y"" -> ""FOW OY"" not. ""J O W O Y"" -> ""JOW OY"" not. Etc.\n\nSo the only possibility is that position 1 is O? But then ""O O _ O Y""\n\nBut position 3 and4: position 3 cannot be O? We established earlier? So position 4 must be O? Then position 3 must be W? So ""O O W O Y"" which is not a word.\n\nContradiction? What\'s wrong?\n\nPerhaps we misinterpreted the feedback. Let me double-check.\n\nIn guess 4: ""woozy"" -> W O O Z Y\nFeedback: W(-), O(✓), O(-), Z(x), Y(✓)\n\nSo:\n- W at position 1: \'-\' -> W is in the word but not at position 1.\n- First O at position 2: \'✓\' -> letter and position correct.\n- Second O at position 3: \'-\' -> this O is in the word but not at position 3. So the secret word has at least two O\'s? Or if only two, the other O is not at position 3? But since position 2 is already O, the other O must be at position 1 or 4 or 5? But position 5 is Y? Fixed? So position 1 or 4 must be O.\n\nBut as above.\n\nYet, ""bookworm"" is 8 letters.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the secret word has only two O\'s? At position 2 and, say, position 4? Then in ""woozy"", the second O at position 3 is correct? But the feedback is \'-\' for position 3, meaning not correct position? So position 3 cannot be O? So secret word position 3 is not O.\n\nSo for position 3 in the secret word, it is not O? And not W? But W is in the word? So position 3 or 4 must be W? And position 1 or 4 must be O.\n\nBut position 4 cannot be both W and O? So it must be one or the other? Or the word has three letters: O, W, and another, to fill positions 1,3,4.\n\nAvailable letters: D,F,H,J,K,O,Q,V,W,X.\n\nBut O and W are used.\n\nNow, let\'s list possible words fitting pattern ? O ? ? Y\n\nWith letters for position 1,3,4 from available, including O and W.\n\nSince the secret word has O at 2, Y at 5, and for the second O, it must be at 1 or 4.\n\nSimilarly, W must be at 3 or 4.\n\nBut position 4 cannot be both O and W? Unless it\'s OW or something? No, one letter per position.\n\nSo possible scenarios:\n\n1. Position 1: O\n   Then we need position 4 to be not O? or O? But if position 4 is O, then position 3 must be W? But ""O O W O Y"" not word.\n\n   If position 1 is O, and position 4 is not O, then position 4 must be something else, and position 3 must be W? But we have no O in position 4? But we need another O? If position 1 is O, that\'s the second O? Then no need for position 4 to be O? But if only two O\'s, yes. So position 1 is O (second O), position 2 O, position 3 W, position 4 another letter, say H, position 5 Y? ""O O W H Y"" -> ""oowhy""? Not a word.\n\n2. Position 1 is not O, so position 4 must be O.\n   Then position 3 cannot be O? Position 3 must be W? Because W must be at 3 or 4? Position 4 is O, so W at 3? Then ""? O W O Y""\n   Position 1 must be available letter: D,F,H,J,K,Q,V,X.\n\n   Possible words: \n   - ""DOW OY"" not\n   - ""FOW OY"" not\n   - etc. as before.\n\nSo only possibility left is that the secret word has three O\'s!? Then position 1,2,4 are O? But position 3 must be W? Then ""O O W O Y"" -> ""oo o"" something.\n\nBut what English word is ""O O W O Y""? None.\n\nPerhaps position 1 is W? But wait, we have feedback that W is \'-\' at position 1? So W cannot be at position 1? So it cannot be.\n\nAnother clue: in ""gumbo"", we had O at position 5 in guess, but secret word only at . position not 5? Now we have O at 2? So that\'s covered.\n\nPerhaps the feedback for the O in ""woozy"" position 3 is \'-\' because the secret word has O at position 4, for example, and we only have two O\'s? Then the \'-\' at position 3 means that there is an O at some other position? But position 2 is already one O? So position 4 must be O? Then in secret word, positions: 2 and 4 are O.\n\nThen structure: position 1: ? , position 2: O, position 3: ? , position 4: O, position 5: Y.\n\nAnd W is in the word? Position 1 cannot be W? So position  must be W? Or position 3 must be W.\n\nSo if position 3 is W? Then ""? O W O Y""\n\nIf position 1 is letter, and position 3 is W? Then ""? O W O Y""\n\nPossible words: if position 1 is ""H"", ""HOW OY"" not.\n\nBut maybe ""THYMY""? Not.\n\nPerhaps "" JOWL Y""? But not 5 letters.\n\nAnother idea: ""rowlock"" not.\n\nPerhaps we missed a word: ""HO  to something.\n\nLet\'s search: 5-letter words ending in OY? Like ""coyer""? E excluded. ""employ"" E and excluded letters.\n\nWith available letters: ? O ? O Y\n\nPosition 1: D,F,H,J,K,Q,V,X\n\nPosition 3: must be a letter? And if we put W at position 3, then ""HOWOY"" not.\n\nOther options for position 3: could be other letters, but we must have W in the word? So position 1 or 3 or 4 must be W? But position 4 is O? So position 1 or 3? But position 1 cannot be W? So position 3 must be W.\n\nSo required: position 3 must be W.\n\nThen we have ""X O W O Y"" for position X at 1 with X in {D,F,H,J,K,Q,V,X}\n\nNone form valid words? For example, ""dow oy"" not.\n\nTherefore, the only logical conclusion is that there might be three O\'s? Or the feedback is misinterpreted.\n\nPerhaps the \'-\' for the second O in ""woozy"" does not mean an additional O? But in standard Wordle rules, it should.\n\nBut let\'s assume that the secret word is ""woo y"" with something.\n\nAnother possibility: the feedback means that for the second O, it is not position, but it is O and there is one more O somewhere else? But we have to place it.\n\nPerhaps position 1 is \'W\' but what? But feedback said W at position 1 is \'-\' so not there.\n\nLet\'s think of available letters. Maybe ""DOWKY""? K excluded? But K is available.\n\nBut ""DOWKY"" is not common? Or ""JOCKY"" C excluded.\n\nPerhaps ""DOWNY"": O,W,N,Y? But N excluded from ""crane"", so no.\n\n""TOWNY"": T and N excluded.\n\n etc.\n\nLet\'s list all possible 5-letter words with pattern ?O??Y, using available letters: D,Fet al.\n\nFor example, ""FOY "" no.\n\n""HOY "" with double letter? ""HOYXY"" not.\n\nPerhaps ""JOWAR"": J O W A R? But A and R excluded? No.\n\n""DOVKY"" not word.\n\n""VOWEL"": V O W E L? E and L excluded? No.\n\nSo no common words.\n\nPerhaps it\'s ""goxes"" no.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps Y is not only at 5? In secret word, position 5 is Y, but other positions? But doesn\'t help.\n\nOr we have not used Q? ""QOPHY"" not word.\n\nPerhaps the word is ""oxyge"". not 5.\n\nI think there\'s a mistake.\n\nPerhaps in ""woozy"", the W at position 1 is \'-\' so W is in the word but not 1, and the O at position 2 is \'✓\' so O at 2, O at position 3 is \'-\' so there must be another O not at 3, and at position 4 we have Z which is x, so not, and Y at 5 is \'✓\' so Y at 5.\n\nSo secret word must have O at 2, Y at 5, W somewhere not 1, and at least one more O not at 3.\n\nThe only positions left are 1 or 4.\n\nIf position 4 is O, then the word is ? O ? O Y\n\nWith ? at 1 and ? at 3.\n\nW is one of them, and not at 1? So W at position 3? Then ? O W O Y\n\nBut what can position 1 be? Let\'s try D: ""DOWOY"" - may be accepted as ""dow oy"" not, but perhaps ""dhow""? Not.\n\nPerhaps ""KHOW"" not.\n\n""SHOWY"": S,H,O,W,Y? But S and H? S excluded? From ""split"", S excluded? Yes. And position 2 O? But ""SHOWY"" has O at position 3? Not position 2.\n\nNot.\n\nPerhaps the word is ""ROWDY"": R,O,W,D,Y? R excluded? Yes.\n\nNo.\n\n""GONGS"" not.\n\nI think we have to consider that the available letters include H, and ""H O W O Y"" might be a typo, or we accept ""HOW OY"" as informal? But not.\n\nPerhaps ""BOOZY"": but B excluded.\n\nOr ""MOODY"": M and O excluded? M from gumbo excluded.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother thought: in ""gumbo"", O was at position 5, and marked \'-\', so secret word has O not at 5, but position 5 is now Y? Fixed.\n\nPerhaps try a guess like ""dowly"" but L excluded.\n\nI found a word: ""DOUBT"" but B and U excluded.\n\nNot.\n\nPerhaps ""FOX Y"" with different spelling? No.\n\nWith available letters, let\'s try ""WHOXY"" not.\n\nPerhaps the secret word is ""WO AL Y"" no.\n\nI think we need to guess a word that guesses the missing letters.\n\nFrom pattern, we can guess:\n\nFor example, assume position 4 is O? Then pattern ? O ? O Y\n\nPosition 1: say H\nPosition 3: W -> ""H O W O Y"" not word.\n\nThen try position 3: say D ? ""H O D O Y"" -> ""hod oy"" not.\n\nOr position 1 F, position 3 D: ""F O D O Y"" -> ""fod oy"" not.\n\n Or ""J O K O Y"" -> ""jokoy"" not a word.\n\nOr ""K O W O Y"" -> ""kow oy"" not.\n\n so perhaps position 4 is not O? Then position 1 must be O? Then pattern O O ? ? Y\n\nPosition 3: cannot be O? available letters for position 3: say W? So O O W ? Y\n\nPosition 4: must be a letter? say D: ""O O W D Y"" -> ""oowdy"" not word.\n\nH: ""oowhy"" not.\n\nK: ""oowky"" not.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps position 4 is O? O O ? O Y? Then position 3: a letter? say W: ""O O W O Y"" same as before.\n\n not.\n\nI think there might be a word like ""woozy"" but with different? Or our earlier conclusion is correct? But no word.\n\nPerhaps the feedback for the second O in ""woozy"" might be because the secret word has only one O? But then position 3 O should be \'x\' if only one O? But it was \'-\', so at least two O\'s.\n\nYes.\n\nUnless the secret word is ""woozy"" itself? But feedback was W(-), O(✓), O(-), Z(x), Y(✓) so secret word has O at 2 and Y at 5, but not Z, and W in the word but not at 1, and another O at different position? But ""woozy"" has O at position 2 and 3? But feedback says at position 3 O is \'-\', so if secret is ""woozy"", position 3 O would be \'✓\'? But it\'s not? So not ""woozy"".\n\nFor example, if secret is ""FOYER"", but many excluded.\n\nNo, secret word is unknown.\n\nPerhaps positions: the secret word has O at position 4? For example, ""DOG OY"" not.\n\n""JOG Y"" not.\n\nLet\'s give up and guess a word that fits the pattern with available letters and includes W and O.\n\nFor example, guess ""HOWDY"" but D and Y? But feedback has Y at 5? But ""HOWDY"" has Y? ""HOWDY"" is H O W D Y? So position 2 O, position 5 Y, and W at position 3? Position 4 D.\n\nBut is ""HOWDY"" a word? Yes, meaning a greeting.\n\nBut what about the O count? In ""HOWDY"", only one O? At position 2? But we think there are two O\'s? In ""woozy"" feedback, the second O was \'-\', which would mean that there is another O in the secret word? But in ""HOWDY"" only one O, so for guess ""woozy"", if secret is ""HOWDY"", then:\n\n- W at p1: secret word has W? Yes, at p3? So feedback should be \'-\' for W? Correct.\n- First O at p2: secret has O at p2? Yes, so \'✓\' correct.\n- Second O at p3: secret has no O at p3? And only one O? So should be \'x\' because only one O and it\'s at p2? But in feedback it was \'-\', which would be wrong if only one O.\n\nSo if secret is ""HOWDY"", then for the second O in ""woozy"", since secret has only one O, it should be \'x\'. But we got \'-\', so not.\n\nTherefore, secret word must have at least two O\'s.\n\n similarly, if secret has two O\'s, then in ""woozy"", O at p3 is not present? Then it should be \'x\' unless there are two O\'s and one is at p2, the other not at p3, so \'-\' means it is present elsewhere.\n\nBack to square one.\n\nPerhaps position 4 is O, and position p1 is a letter, and position p3 is not W? But what? Then let\'s assume the secret word does not have to have W? But from feedback in ""woozy"", W is \'-\' at p1, so must be in the word? Yes.\n\nSo we must have W somewhere.\n\nSo for position p3, must be W? As earlier. and position p4 O, and position p1? and no word.\n\nPerhaps we overlooked a letter. Available letters include F,H,J,K, etc.\n\nMake a guess like ""HO W O Y"" with position 1 H, position 2 O, position 3 W, position 4 O, position 5 Y: ""HOWOY"" or ""H O W O Y"".\n\nIf we guess it, feedback will tell.\n\nBut we risk.\n\nOtherwise, we have only a few letters left.\n\nList of available: D,F,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X,O,Y (but O and Y used)\n\nFor guess, we can try ""H O W O Y"" as ""howoy"", though it may not be valid, or choose.\n\nAnother word: ""DOFFY"" but F double? ""DoOff Y""? Not.\n\n""YOWED"" E excluded.\n\nPerhaps ""WOOFY"" W,O,O,F,Y? But position 1 W? But feedback from ""woozy"" W not at p1? So if we guess ""WOOFY"", position 1 W, but secret word W cannot be at 1, so if we guess W at 1, it will be marked \'-\' or \'x\'? If secret W not at 1, then \'x\' if not in word? But \' \' since present would be \'-\'.\n\nBut \'WOOFY\' has O,O,F,W,Y? Pattern: position 2 and 3 are O? It would then have O at 2 and 3, but we need position 2 O fixed? Yes. Position 5 Y fixed. But then O at 3? But in previous feedback, position 3 O was marked \'-\' in ""woozy"", which means secret position 3 is not O? But in ""WOOFY"", if we guess, position 3 is O, which might be correct or not.\n\nSo to test, guess ""WOOFY"".\n\nPosition 1: W, position 2: O, position 3: O, position 4: F, position 5: Y.\n\nBut from available letters, F is available? Yes.\n\nSo <guess>woofy</guess>\n\nOr better, guess ""HOWDY"" even though it might not have the O\'s.\n\nBut let\'s calculate the feedback.\n\nFor position 1: if secret W not at 1, then \'-\' if W present, or \'x\' if not.\n\nBut it might be.\n\nBut to be systematic, we have few options.\n\nAnother common word? I recall ""roomy"" but R and M excluded.\n\nSo ""woofy"" is a word? Yes, meaning rich in wool or something.\n\nAnd it has two O\'s? And W at 1, position fixed.\n\nBut position 1 is W? Which is not allowed? Because from feedback, W cannot be at position 1? But in guess, we can guess anything? The feedback will tell.\n\nSo for ""woofy"":\n\n- Position 1 W: if secret W not at 1, then \'-\' (since W present elsewhere)\n- Position 2 O: \'✓\' (since secret position 2 is O)\n- Position 3 O: if secret position 3 is not O, and secret has only two O\'s at 2 and say 4, then \'-\' for position 3 O? Because O is present but not at 3.\n\nThen position 4 F: we don\'t know.\nPosition 5 Y: \'✓\'\n\nSo it might give information.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""WOOFY"".\n\n<guess>woofy</guess> \n\nAfter all, we have to guess.\n\nOr better, ""HOWDY"" with only one O, but if secret has two O\'s, it may be wrong, but we can guess.\n\nBut let\'s do ""WOOFY"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses and the constraints deduced, the analysis is as follows:\n\n### Deductions from Feedback:\n1. **Excluded Letters**: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, L, I, T, G, U, M, B, Z (from all ""x"" feedback).\n2. **Confirmed Letters and Positions**: \n   - O is at position 2 (from Guess 4: ""woozy"" → O(✓)).\n   - Y is at position 5 (from Guess 4: ""woozy"" → Y(✓)).\n3. **Letters in Word but Wrong Position**: \n   - W is present in the word but not at position 1 (from Guess 4: ""woozy"" → W(-)).\n   - The second O (from ""woozy"") is present but not at position 3. Combined with O(✓) at position 2, this confirms at least two O\'s in the word, with the second O not at position 3 (implying it could be at position 1 or 4).\n4. **Remaining Available Letters**: D, F, H, J, K, O, Q, V, W, X.\n5. **Word Pattern**: The secret word must be of the form _ O _ _ Y, with positions 1, 3, and 4 unknown, but must include W and at least one more O.\n\n### Step-By-Step Reasoning:\n- **Pattern Constraints**: The word must have the pattern ? O ? ? Y, with O at position 2 and Y at position 5. Positions 1, 3, and 4 must be filled using available letters, including W and at least one more O.\n- **Letter Constraints**: Position 1 cannot be W (from W(-)), and position 3 cannot be O (from O(-) in Guess 4).\n- **Combination Challenges**: Available letters are limited (~10), and common words are scarce due to the pattern and repeated O\'s. Possible candidates include:\n  - ""HOWDY"": Tests H, O, W, D, Y. However, it has only one O, conflicting with the requirement for at least two O\'s.\n  - ""WOOFY"": Tests W, O, O, F, Y. It fits the pattern (W at position 1—which must be misplaced per feedback), two O\'s (position 2 fixed, position 3 to test), and Y at position 5. This could reveal:\n    - If W is in the word but not position 1, feedback will be W(-).\n    - If the secret word has an additional O at position 3 or elsewhere, it will appear in feedback.\n- **Why ""WOOFY""?**: Despite W at position 1 potentially being invalid per feedback, guessing ""WOOFY"" leverages:\n  - **Position 4**: Tests F, a new common letter.\n  - **Information Gain**: Confirms W (position or presence), the letter at position 4 (F), and resolves the second O location.\n  - **Balanced Letters**: Uses high-frequency available consonants (W, F) and probes for the second O position.\n\n### Decision:\n- ""WOOFY"" is valid English (meaning wool-like) and respects the constraints. It is chosen to gather critical information on W, the second O, and position 4, with available letters.\n\n<guess>woofy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: split -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) L(x) I(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: gumbo -> FEEDBACK: G(x) U(x) M(x) B(x) O(-)\nGuess 4: woozy -> FEEDBACK: W(-) O(✓) O(-) Z(x) Y(✓)\nGuess 5: woofy -> FEEDBACK: W(-) O(✓) O(-) F(x) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from the fifth guess ""woofy"":
- W(-): W is in the word but not at position 1.
- First O(✓): O is correct and in position 2.
- Second O(-): O is in the word but not at position 3.
- F(x): F is not in the word.
- Y(✓): Y is correct and in position 5.

From this, we can update our information:

1. **Excluded Letters**: Adding F to the exclusion list. Now excluded: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, L, I, T, G, U, M, B, Z, F.
2. **Confirmed Letters and Positions**:
   - Position 2: O
   - Position 5: Y
3. **Letters in Word but Wrong Position**:
   - W is present but not at position 1.
   - There is at least one more O (since the second O in ""woofy"" at position 3 is marked as present but wrong position, and we already have one O at position 2). This means the secret word has at least two O's, and the second O is not at position 3.
4. **Remaining Available Letters**: D, H, J, K, O, Q, V, W, X. (Note: O and W are confirmed present, so they are available but we know they are in the word.)

**Word Pattern**: The secret word is of the form _ O _ _ Y, with positions 1, 3, and 4 to be filled.

Constraints:
- Position 1: Cannot be W (from W(-) in guess 4 and 5), and must be one of the available letters.
- Position 3: Cannot be O (from O(-) in guess 4 and 5), and must be one of the available letters. Also, since W is present and not at position 1, it could be at position 3 or 4.
- Position 4: Must be one of the available letters. It could be O or W or another letter, but note that we have at least two O's, so one of position 1 or 4 must be O (since position 3 cannot be O).

Given that there are at least two O's and position 2 is one, the other O must be at position 1 or 4.

Also, W is present and not at position 1, so it must be at position 3 or 4.

Now, the available letters for positions 1, 3, 4 are: D, H, J, K, O, Q, V, W, X. But O and W are already in the word, so we can use them again if needed.

We need to form a word that fits the pattern and includes:
- O at position 2 and another O at position 1 or 4.
- W at position 3 or 4.

But position 4 might be O or W, but not both unless the word has three O's or two W's? We don't have evidence of three O's or two W's, but it's possible.

Given the limited letters, let's consider possibilities:

Case 1: Position 1 is O.
Then the word is O O _ _ Y.
Position 3: Cannot be O, so it must be a different letter. Also, W must be at position 3 or 4. If position 3 is W, then position 4 must be a letter. If position 3 is not W, then position 4 must be W.
But we have available letters: D, H, J, K, Q, V, X (since O and W are used, but we can use them if needed? Position 4 could be O? But if position 1 is O, we already have two O's, so position 4 doesn't have to be O. But we have the second O at position 1, so position 4 can be something else.

But from feedback, we know there is at least one more O? In this case, with O at 1 and 2, that's two O's, so the third position cannot be O, and position 4 can be any available letter including W.

But we need to include W. So:
- If position 3 is W, then position 4 can be, say, D, H, etc.
- If position 4 is W, then position 3 can be D, H, etc.

But what words are possible?
- O O W _ Y: Then position 4 must be a letter. Available: D, H, J, K, Q, V, X. Possible words: ""OOWDY""? Not a word. ""OOWHY""? Not. ""OOWKY""? Not. No common words.

- O O _ W Y: Then position 3 must be a letter. ""OOHWY""? Not. ""OODWY""? Not. Also not words.

Case 2: Position 4 is O.
Then the word is _ O _ O Y.
Position 1: Cannot be W, so it must be one of D, H, J, K, Q, V, X.
Position 3: Cannot be O, and must be a letter. Also, W must be at position 3 or 4? But position 4 is O, so W must be at position 3? Because W is present and not at 1, so position 3 must be W.

Then the word is ? O W O Y.

Now, position 1 must be one of D, H, J, K, Q, V, X.

Possible words:
- H O W O Y: ""HOWOY"" - not a standard word.
- D O W O Y: ""DOWOY"" - not a word.
- J O W O Y: ""JOWOY"" - not a word.
- K O W O Y: ""KOWOY"" - not a word.
- V O W O Y: ""VOWOY"" - not a word.
- X O W O Y: ""XOWOY"" - not a word.

No valid English words.

Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the secret word has three O's: at position 2, and two more at positions 1 and 4? Or position 1 and 3? But position 3 cannot be O (from feedback), so positions 1 and 4 must be O? Then we have O at 1,2,4? And position 3 must be W? Then ""O O W O Y"".

But ""OOWOY"" is not a word.

Perhaps position 4 is not O, but we have three O's with position 1 and 4? But position 1 O, position 2 O, position 4 O, and position 3 W: ""O O W O Y"" same as above.

Not a word.

So what's wrong? Perhaps we missed that in ""woofy"", the second O at position 3 is marked as '-' which means there is another O in the word not at position 3. But if the secret word has O at position 4, for example, then in ""woofy"", position 3 O should be marked as '-' because there is an O at position 4? But in ""woofy"", position 4 is F, which is not O.

But in the secret word, if it has O at position 4, then for ""woofy"" guess:
- Position 3: O is guessed, but secret has no O at 3, but has O at 4, so it should be marked as '-' (present but wrong position).

Similarly, in ""woozy"", position 3 O was marked '-' which could be for the same reason.

But we still need a word of the form ? O ? O Y with position 3 being W? But no word.

Perhaps position 1 is not O, position 4 is not O, but there is an O at position 3? But feedback says position 3 cannot be O? From both ""woozy"" and ""woofy"", the O at position 3 is marked as not correct position, so secret position 3 is not O.

So position 3 is not O.

Therefore, the only positions for the second O are 1 or 4.

But we can't find a word, so perhaps we need to consider that the secret word has W at position 4 and O at position 1, for example.

Let's list all possible words that fit the pattern and available letters.

Available letters: D, H, J, K, O, Q, V, W, X.

Pattern: [D,H,J,K,O,Q,V,W,X] O [D,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X] [D,H,J,K,O,Q,V,W,X] Y

But with constraints:
- The word must contain at least two O's (so either position 1 is O or position 4 is O or both).
- The word must contain W, and W cannot be at position 1.

So possible candidates:

If position 1 is O, then the word is O O [not O] [letter] Y, and must contain W. So W must be at position 3 or 4.

- Position 3: W, then position 4: D, H, J, K, Q, V, X. No common words: O O W D Y, etc.

- Position 4: W, then position 3: D, H, J, K, Q, V, X. O O [letter] W Y. Possible? ""OOHWY"" not, ""OODWY"" not.

If position 4 is O, then the word is [letter] O [not O] O Y, and must contain W. Since position 1 cannot be W, W must be at position 3. So [letter] O W O Y.

Position 1: D, H, J, K, Q, V, X.

No common words.

Perhaps ""JOWLY"" but L excluded.

Or ""HOWDY"" but only one O.

Another idea: perhaps the secret word is ""Kooky"" but K and Y, but O at 2 and 3? But position 3 cannot be O? And K is available.

""K O O K Y"" but position 3 O would be incorrect if secret position 3 is not O.

But in this case, if secret is ""K O O K Y"", then for ""woofy"" guess:
- Position 3 O: secret has O at 3, so should be '✓', but it was '-', so not.

So secret position 3 is not O.

Perhaps the word is ""DOX OY"" not.

I think we have to consider that the available letters include Q, and ""QOPHY"" not a word.

Or ""VODKY"" not.

Perhaps ""WO J O Y"" not.

Let's try to guess a word that has O at position 1 and W at position 4, for example.

Guess ""O O D W Y"" but not a word.

Or ""H O W D Y"" but only one O.

But we need two O's.

Another possibility: the secret word has O at position 4, and position 1 is H, position 3 is W: ""H O W O Y"" – even if not common, it might be accepted? But unlikely.

Perhaps we missed a letter. Available letters include Y, but Y is at position 5, so not used elsewhere.

Or we can use double letters.

Let's look for words ending with OY: like ""boy"", ""coy"", etc., but with 5 letters.

""ABBEY"" not OY.

""COPY"" not 5.

""DOILY"" not OY.

""GOLLY"" not.

""JOLLY"" L excluded.

""LOBBY"" L and B excluded.

""NOBLY"" excluded.

""POLLY"" excluded.

""ROWDY"" excluded.

""TOWNY"" excluded.

""WOWED"" E excluded.

""BOXED"" excluded.

So no.

Perhaps ""DOOZY"" but Z excluded.

I think we have to guess ""HOWDY"" even though it has only one O, to test.

Or ""WHOOP"" P excluded.

Let's try ""DOW OY"" not.

Perhaps the word is ""DOXEY"" not.

I found a word: ""DOX OY"" no.

Another: ""FOYER"" excluded.

Perhaps ""GOYIM"" G and I excluded.

No.

So for the guess, we can try ""HOWDY"" to check if there is only one O? But feedback suggests two O's.

From guess 4 ""woozy"": O at position 3 is '-' so there is another O besides position 2.

Similarly in guess 5 ""woofy"": O at position 3 is '-' so there is another O besides position 2.

So definitely at least two O's.

Therefore, we must have a word with two O's, one at position 2, and the other at position 1 or 4.

And position 3 is not O.

And W is in the word, not at 1, so at 3 or 4.

And position 4 might be O or W.

But no common words, so perhaps ""O O W O Y"" is not, but let's assume it's ""ow oy"" something.

Perhaps the secret word is ""woozy"" but we had feedback that Z is x, so not.

Or ""boozy"" B excluded.

I think we have to guess a word like ""O O D W Y"" but not, so for the sake of guessing, let's try ""HOWDY"" to see if the feedback changes.

But it's risky.

Perhaps ""JOWAR"" not.

Let's list all 5-letter words ending with Y and with O at position 2.

For example, ""BOOTY"" B and T excluded.

""FOOTY"" F and T excluded? F is available? In guess 5, F is x, so F excluded.

F is excluded.

In guess 5, F(x), so F is not in the word.

So available letters: D, H, J, K, O, Q, V, W, X.

Words: ""DOWDY"" D,O,W,D,Y? Double D? ""DOWDY"" is a word, meaning not stylish.

But ""DOWDY"": positions:
- Position 1: D
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: W
- Position 4: D
- Position 5: Y

But we have position 2 O, position 5 Y, and position 3 W? And position 4 D.

But what about the O's? ""DOWDY"" has only one O? At position 2.

But we need two O's? So if secret is ""DOWDY"", then for ""woofy"" guess:
- Position 3 O: secret has no O at 3, and only one O, so it should be 'x', but it was '-', which would be incorrect.

So not.

""JOWLY"" L excluded.

""LOWLY"" L excluded.

""MOLLY"" excluded.

""NOBLY"" excluded.

""POWAY"" not word.

""ROW DY"" not.

""TOWNY"" excluded.

""VODKA"" not ending with Y.

""WODGY"" G excluded.

""YOWES"" E excluded.

So no common words.

Perhaps ""KOHEN"" not ending with Y.

I think there's a mistake in the feedback interpretation.

Another possibility: in ""woofy"", the second O at position 3 is marked as '-' which means that there is an O in the word but not at position 3. But if the secret word has O at position 2 and position 4, for example, then it should be '-', but we need a word like ""H O ? O Y"" with ? being a letter.

But ""H O D O Y"" not word.

Or ""D O K O Y"" not.

Perhaps ""O O Z E Y"" not.

I think we have to guess ""HOWDY"" to test the O count.

Or guess ""DOX OY"" not.

Let's try to include W and O in position 4.

Guess ""D O W O Y"" as ""dowoy"", though not valid.

But for the game, we can guess a word like ""dowly"" but L excluded.

So available letters for position 1: D,H,J,K,Q,V,X

Position 3: D,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X (cannot O)

Position 4: D,H,J,K,O,Q,V,W,X

And must have at least one of position 1 or 4 as O, and W in position 3 or 4.

So for example, if position 1 is D, position 3 is W, position 4 is O: ""D O W O Y"" ""dowoy"" not a word.

If position 1 is H, position 3 is W, position 4 is O: ""H O W O Y"" ""howoy"" not.

If position 1 is O, position 3 is W, position 4 is H: ""O O W H Y"" ""oowhy"" not.

 etc.

No.

Perhaps position 4 is W and position 1 is O: ""O O D W Y"" ""oodwy"" not.

I think we have to choose a word that uses the available letters and fits as much as possible.

For example, ""JOKED"" E excluded.

Or ""WOVEN"" E and N excluded.

So for the next guess, let's try ""HOWDY"" to see if it's accepted and to test the O count.

If we guess ""HOWDY"", which is H O W D Y:

- Position 2 O: '✓' (correct)
- Position 5 Y: '✓' (correct)
- Position 1 H: if H is in the word, feedback will tell.
- Position 3 W: if W is in the word, feedback will tell. But we know W is in the word, so it should be '-' or '✓' if at position 3.
- Position 4 D: if D is in the word.

But if ""HOWDY"" has only one O, then the feedback for position 3 O in previous guesses should have been 'x' for ""woofy"" and ""woozy"", but it was '-', so it's inconsistent.

Therefore, ""HOWDY"" cannot be the word.

Similarly, any word with only one O is invalid.

So we must have two O's.

Perhaps the secret word has O at position 1 and position 2, and position 4 is a letter, and position 3 is W, but no word.

Or perhaps the secret word is ""woo y"" with a different spelling.

I recall that ""wox oy"" not.

Perhaps ""box h"" not.

I think for the sake of the game, we can guess ""JOWLY"" but L excluded.

Let's give up and guess ""HOWDY"" to force feedback.

But let's think of a word like ""DOUGH"" but G and U excluded.

No.

Another idea: perhaps the feedback for ""gumbo"" O(-) means O is in the word but not at position 5, which we know, but it doesn't specify how many.

Similarly, in ""woozy"" and ""woofy"", the O at position 3 is '-' which means there is an O in the word not at position 3, but it could be the same O at position 2? But in Wordle, if a letter is correct at one position, and you guess it at another position, it will show as '-' for the second occurrence if it's present elsewhere.

For example, if the secret word has only one O at position 2, and you guess ""woozy"" with O at position 2 and 3, then position 2 O is '✓', and position 3 O should be 'x' because there is no second O. But in our feedback, it was '-', which means there is a second O in the secret word.

Similarly for ""woofy"".

So definitely two O's.

Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that the secret word has O at position 2 and position 4, and position 3 is W, and position 1 is a letter that makes a word, even if uncommon.

For example, ""H O W O Y"" might be considered, but it's not standard.

Perhaps in the context, we can use ""dow oy"" as ""dowoy"", but not.

I found a word: ""dow y"" not.

Perhaps ""yow"" not 5 letters.

So for the guess, I will choose ""HOWDY"" to test, even though it may not have two O's, but it's a common word, and the feedback will clarify.

Or ""JOLLY"" but excluded.

So <guess>howdy</guess>

But let's do it.
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from all previous guesses, the following is deduced:

- **Excluded Letters**: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, L, I, T, G, U, M, B, Z, F (all marked ""x"" in feedback).
- **Confirmed Letters and Positions**:
  - Position 2: O (from ""woozy"" and ""woofy"" feedback).
  - Position 5: Y (from ""woozy"" and ""woofy"" feedback).
- **Letters in Word but Wrong Position**:
  - W is present but not at position 1 (from ""woozy"" and ""woofy"" feedback).
  - There is at least one additional O in the word, not at position 3 (from ""woozy"" and ""woofy"" feedback, where the second O was marked ""-"").
- **Word Pattern**: The secret word is of the form `_ O _ _ Y`.
- **Available Letters**: D, H, J, K, O, Q, V, W, X (O and W are confirmed present but not fully positioned).

### Key Constraints:
- Position 1: Cannot be W (per feedback) and must be one of the available letters (D, H, J, K, Q, V, X, or O).
- Position 3: Cannot be O (per feedback) and must be one of the available letters (D, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X).
- Position 4: Must be one of the available letters (D, H, J, K, O, Q, V, W, X) and likely contains the second O or W.
- The word must contain at least two O's (positions 2 and one other) and W (not at position 1).

### Reasoning for the Next Guess:
- Given the constraints, the only feasible pattern is `? O ? ? Y` with the second O at position 1 or 4, and W at position 3 or 4.
- Common words are scarce due to the limited letter pool and pattern. After evaluating options:
  - `HOWDY` (H O W D Y) is a valid word that tests:
    - Position 1: H (new letter, could be present or absent).
    - Position 3: W (tests if W is at position 3; if present, feedback will confirm or deny).
    - Position 4: D (new letter, could be present or absent).
    - It also challenges the O-count: if `HOWDY` is correct, it would imply only one O (contradicting prior feedback), but this guess will clarify if the secret word has exactly one O or if our deduction of two O's is correct.
- If `HOWDY` is incorrect, feedback on H, W, and D will provide critical information to resolve the word in the next guess.

<guess>howdy</guess>",howdy,"We have the feedback from the fifth guess ""woofy"":
- W(-): W is in the word but not at position 1.
- First O(✓): O is correct and in position 2.
- Second O(-): O is in the word but not at position 3.
- F(x): F is not in the word.
- Y(✓): Y is correct and in position 5.

From this, we can update our information:

1. **Excluded Letters**: Adding F to the exclusion list. Now excluded: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, L, I, T, G, U, M, B, Z, F.
2. **Confirmed Letters and Positions**:
   - Position 2: O
   - Position 5: Y
3. **Letters in Word but Wrong Position**:
   - W is present but not at position 1.
   - There is at least one more O (since the second O in ""woofy"" at position 3 is marked as present but wrong position, and we already have one O at position 2). This means the secret word has at least two O's, and the second O is not at position 3.
4. **Remaining Available Letters**: D, H, J, K, O, Q, V, W, X. (Note: O and W are confirmed present, so they are available but we know they are in the word.)

**Word Pattern**: The secret word is of the form _ O _ _ Y, with positions 1, 3, and 4 to be filled.

Constraints:
- Position 1: Cannot be W (from W(-) in guess 4 and 5), and must be one of the available letters.
- Position 3: Cannot be O (from O(-) in guess 4 and 5), and must be one of the available letters. Also, since W is present and not at position 1, it could be at position 3 or 4.
- Position 4: Must be one of the available letters. It could be O or W or another letter, but note that we have at least two O's, so one of position 1 or 4 must be O (since position 3 cannot be O).

Given that there are at least two O's and position 2 is one, the other O must be at position 1 or 4.

Also, W is present and not at position 1, so it must be at position 3 or 4.

Now, the available letters for positions 1, 3, 4 are: D, H, J, K, O, Q, V, W, X. But O and W are already in the word, so we can use them again if needed.

We need to form a word that fits the pattern and includes:
- O at position 2 and another O at position 1 or 4.
- W at position 3 or 4.

But position 4 might be O or W, but not both unless the word has three O's or two W's? We don't have evidence of three O's or two W's, but it's possible.

Given the limited letters, let's consider possibilities:

Case 1: Position 1 is O.
Then the word is O O _ _ Y.
Position 3: Cannot be O, so it must be a different letter. Also, W must be at position 3 or 4. If position 3 is W, then position 4 must be a letter. If position 3 is not W, then position 4 must be W.
But we have available letters: D, H, J, K, Q, V, X (since O and W are used, but we can use them if needed? Position 4 could be O? But if position 1 is O, we already have two O's, so position 4 doesn't have to be O. But we have the second O at position 1, so position 4 can be something else.

But from feedback, we know there is at least one more O? In this case, with O at 1 and 2, that's two O's, so the third position cannot be O, and position 4 can be any available letter including W.

But we need to include W. So:
- If position 3 is W, then position 4 can be, say, D, H, etc.
- If position 4 is W, then position 3 can be D, H, etc.

But what words are possible?
- O O W _ Y: Then position 4 must be a letter. Available: D, H, J, K, Q, V, X. Possible words: ""OOWDY""? Not a word. ""OOWHY""? Not. ""OOWKY""? Not. No common words.

- O O _ W Y: Then position 3 must be a letter. ""OOHWY""? Not. ""OODWY""? Not. Also not words.

Case 2: Position 4 is O.
Then the word is _ O _ O Y.
Position 1: Cannot be W, so it must be one of D, H, J, K, Q, V, X.
Position 3: Cannot be O, and must be a letter. Also, W must be at position 3 or 4? But position 4 is O, so W must be at position 3? Because W is present and not at 1, so position 3 must be W.

Then the word is ? O W O Y.

Now, position 1 must be one of D, H, J, K, Q, V, X.

Possible words:
- H O W O Y: ""HOWOY"" - not a standard word.
- D O W O Y: ""DOWOY"" - not a word.
- J O W O Y: ""JOWOY"" - not a word.
- K O W O Y: ""KOWOY"" - not a word.
- V O W O Y: ""VOWOY"" - not a word.
- X O W O Y: ""XOWOY"" - not a word.

No valid English words.

Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the secret word has three O's: at position 2, and two more at positions 1 and 4? Or position 1 and 3? But position 3 cannot be O (from feedback), so positions 1 and 4 must be O? Then we have O at 1,2,4? And position 3 must be W? Then ""O O W O Y"".

But ""OOWOY"" is not a word.

Perhaps position 4 is not O, but we have three O's with position 1 and 4? But position 1 O, position 2 O, position 4 O, and position 3 W: ""O O W O Y"" same as above.

Not a word.

So what's wrong? Perhaps we missed that in ""woofy"", the second O at position 3 is marked as '-' which means there is another O in the word not at position 3. But if the secret word has O at position 4, for example, then in ""woofy"", position 3 O should be marked as '-' because there is an O at position 4? But in ""woofy"", position 4 is F, which is not O.

But in the secret word, if it has O at position 4, then for ""woofy"" guess:
- Position 3: O is guessed, but secret has no O at 3, but has O at 4, so it should be marked as '-' (present but wrong position).

Similarly, in ""woozy"", position 3 O was marked '-' which could be for the same reason.

But we still need a word of the form ? O ? O Y with position 3 being W? But no word.

Perhaps position 1 is not O, position 4 is not O, but there is an O at position 3? But feedback says position 3 cannot be O? From both ""woozy"" and ""woofy"", the O at position 3 is marked as not correct position, so secret position 3 is not O.

So position 3 is not O.

Therefore, the only positions for the second O are 1 or 4.

But we can't find a word, so perhaps we need to consider that the secret word has W at position 4 and O at position 1, for example.

Let's list all possible words that fit the pattern and available letters.

Available letters: D, H, J, K, O, Q, V, W, X.

Pattern: [D,H,J,K,O,Q,V,W,X] O [D,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X] [D,H,J,K,O,Q,V,W,X] Y

But with constraints:
- The word must contain at least two O's (so either position 1 is O or position 4 is O or both).
- The word must contain W, and W cannot be at position 1.

So possible candidates:

If position 1 is O, then the word is O O [not O] [letter] Y, and must contain W. So W must be at position 3 or 4.

- Position 3: W, then position 4: D, H, J, K, Q, V, X. No common words: O O W D Y, etc.

- Position 4: W, then position 3: D, H, J, K, Q, V, X. O O [letter] W Y. Possible? ""OOHWY"" not, ""OODWY"" not.

If position 4 is O, then the word is [letter] O [not O] O Y, and must contain W. Since position 1 cannot be W, W must be at position 3. So [letter] O W O Y.

Position 1: D, H, J, K, Q, V, X.

No common words.

Perhaps ""JOWLY"" but L excluded.

Or ""HOWDY"" but only one O.

Another idea: perhaps the secret word is ""Kooky"" but K and Y, but O at 2 and 3? But position 3 cannot be O? And K is available.

""K O O K Y"" but position 3 O would be incorrect if secret position 3 is not O.

But in this case, if secret is ""K O O K Y"", then for ""woofy"" guess:
- Position 3 O: secret has O at 3, so should be '✓', but it was '-', so not.

So secret position 3 is not O.

Perhaps the word is ""DOX OY"" not.

I think we have to consider that the available letters include Q, and ""QOPHY"" not a word.

Or ""VODKY"" not.

Perhaps ""WO J O Y"" not.

Let's try to guess a word that has O at position 1 and W at position 4, for example.

Guess ""O O D W Y"" but not a word.

Or ""H O W D Y"" but only one O.

But we need two O's.

Another possibility: the secret word has O at position 4, and position 1 is H, position 3 is W: ""H O W O Y"" – even if not common, it might be accepted? But unlikely.

Perhaps we missed a letter. Available letters include Y, but Y is at position 5, so not used elsewhere.

Or we can use double letters.

Let's look for words ending with OY: like ""boy"", ""coy"", etc., but with 5 letters.

""ABBEY"" not OY.

""COPY"" not 5.

""DOILY"" not OY.

""GOLLY"" not.

""JOLLY"" L excluded.

""LOBBY"" L and B excluded.

""NOBLY"" excluded.

""POLLY"" excluded.

""ROWDY"" excluded.

""TOWNY"" excluded.

""WOWED"" E excluded.

""BOXED"" excluded.

So no.

Perhaps ""DOOZY"" but Z excluded.

I think we have to guess ""HOWDY"" even though it has only one O, to test.

Or ""WHOOP"" P excluded.

Let's try ""DOW OY"" not.

Perhaps the word is ""DOXEY"" not.

I found a word: ""DOX OY"" no.

Another: ""FOYER"" excluded.

Perhaps ""GOYIM"" G and I excluded.

No.

So for the guess, we can try ""HOWDY"" to check if there is only one O? But feedback suggests two O's.

From guess 4 ""woozy"": O at position 3 is '-' so there is another O besides position 2.

Similarly in guess 5 ""woofy"": O at position 3 is '-' so there is another O besides position 2.

So definitely at least two O's.

Therefore, we must have a word with two O's, one at position 2, and the other at position 1 or 4.

And position 3 is not O.

And W is in the word, not at 1, so at 3 or 4.

And position 4 might be O or W.

But no common words, so perhaps ""O O W O Y"" is not, but let's assume it's ""ow oy"" something.

Perhaps the secret word is ""woozy"" but we had feedback that Z is x, so not.

Or ""boozy"" B excluded.

I think we have to guess a word like ""O O D W Y"" but not, so for the sake of guessing, let's try ""HOWDY"" to see if the feedback changes.

But it's risky.

Perhaps ""JOWAR"" not.

Let's list all 5-letter words ending with Y and with O at position 2.

For example, ""BOOTY"" B and T excluded.

""FOOTY"" F and T excluded? F is available? In guess 5, F is x, so F excluded.

F is excluded.

In guess 5, F(x), so F is not in the word.

So available letters: D, H, J, K, O, Q, V, W, X.

Words: ""DOWDY"" D,O,W,D,Y? Double D? ""DOWDY"" is a word, meaning not stylish.

But ""DOWDY"": positions:
- Position 1: D
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: W
- Position 4: D
- Position 5: Y

But we have position 2 O, position 5 Y, and position 3 W? And position 4 D.

But what about the O's? ""DOWDY"" has only one O? At position 2.

But we need two O's? So if secret is ""DOWDY"", then for ""woofy"" guess:
- Position 3 O: secret has no O at 3, and only one O, so it should be 'x', but it was '-', which would be incorrect.

So not.

""JOWLY"" L excluded.

""LOWLY"" L excluded.

""MOLLY"" excluded.

""NOBLY"" excluded.

""POWAY"" not word.

""ROW DY"" not.

""TOWNY"" excluded.

""VODKA"" not ending with Y.

""WODGY"" G excluded.

""YOWES"" E excluded.

So no common words.

Perhaps ""KOHEN"" not ending with Y.

I think there's a mistake in the feedback interpretation.

Another possibility: in ""woofy"", the second O at position 3 is marked as '-' which means that there is an O in the word but not at position 3. But if the secret word has O at position 2 and position 4, for example, then it should be '-', but we need a word like ""H O ? O Y"" with ? being a letter.

But ""H O D O Y"" not word.

Or ""D O K O Y"" not.

Perhaps ""O O Z E Y"" not.

I think we have to guess ""HOWDY"" to test the O count.

Or guess ""DOX OY"" not.

Let's try to include W and O in position 4.

Guess ""D O W O Y"" as ""dowoy"", though not valid.

But for the game, we can guess a word like ""dowly"" but L excluded.

So available letters for position 1: D,H,J,K,Q,V,X

Position 3: D,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X (cannot O)

Position 4: D,H,J,K,O,Q,V,W,X

And must have at least one of position 1 or 4 as O, and W in position 3 or 4.

So for example, if position 1 is D, position 3 is W, position 4 is O: ""D O W O Y"" ""dowoy"" not a word.

If position 1 is H, position 3 is W, position 4 is O: ""H O W O Y"" ""howoy"" not.

If position 1 is O, position 3 is W, position 4 is H: ""O O W H Y"" ""oowhy"" not.

 etc.

No.

Perhaps position 4 is W and position 1 is O: ""O O D W Y"" ""oodwy"" not.

I think we have to choose a word that uses the available letters and fits as much as possible.

For example, ""JOKED"" E excluded.

Or ""WOVEN"" E and N excluded.

So for the next guess, let's try ""HOWDY"" to see if it's accepted and to test the O count.

If we guess ""HOWDY"", which is H O W D Y:

- Position 2 O: '✓' (correct)
- Position 5 Y: '✓' (correct)
- Position 1 H: if H is in the word, feedback will tell.
- Position 3 W: if W is in the word, feedback will tell. But we know W is in the word, so it should be '-' or '✓' if at position 3.
- Position 4 D: if D is in the word.

But if ""HOWDY"" has only one O, then the feedback for position 3 O in previous guesses should have been 'x' for ""woofy"" and ""woozy"", but it was '-', so it's inconsistent.

Therefore, ""HOWDY"" cannot be the word.

Similarly, any word with only one O is invalid.

So we must have two O's.

Perhaps the secret word has O at position 1 and position 2, and position 4 is a letter, and position 3 is W, but no word.

Or perhaps the secret word is ""woo y"" with a different spelling.

I recall that ""wox oy"" not.

Perhaps ""box h"" not.

I think for the sake of the game, we can guess ""JOWLY"" but L excluded.

Let's give up and guess ""HOWDY"" to force feedback.

But let's think of a word like ""DOUGH"" but G and U excluded.

No.

Another idea: perhaps the feedback for ""gumbo"" O(-) means O is in the word but not at position 5, which we know, but it doesn't specify how many.

Similarly, in ""woozy"" and ""woofy"", the O at position 3 is '-' which means there is an O in the word not at position 3, but it could be the same O at position 2? But in Wordle, if a letter is correct at one position, and you guess it at another position, it will show as '-' for the second occurrence if it's present elsewhere.

For example, if the secret word has only one O at position 2, and you guess ""woozy"" with O at position 2 and 3, then position 2 O is '✓', and position 3 O should be 'x' because there is no second O. But in our feedback, it was '-', which means there is a second O in the secret word.

Similarly for ""woofy"".

So definitely two O's.

Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that the secret word has O at position 2 and position 4, and position 3 is W, and position 1 is a letter that makes a word, even if uncommon.

For example, ""H O W O Y"" might be considered, but it's not standard.

Perhaps in the context, we can use ""dow oy"" as ""dowoy"", but not.

I found a word: ""dow y"" not.

Perhaps ""yow"" not 5 letters.

So for the guess, I will choose ""HOWDY"" to test, even though it may not have two O's, but it's a common word, and the feedback will clarify.

Or ""JOLLY"" but excluded.

So <guess>howdy</guess>

But let's do it.After analyzing the feedback from all previous guesses, the following is deduced:

- **Excluded Letters**: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, L, I, T, G, U, M, B, Z, F (all marked ""x"" in feedback).
- **Confirmed Letters and Positions**:
  - Position 2: O (from ""woozy"" and ""woofy"" feedback).
  - Position 5: Y (from ""woozy"" and ""woofy"" feedback).
- **Letters in Word but Wrong Position**:
  - W is present but not at position 1 (from ""woozy"" and ""woofy"" feedback).
  - There is at least one additional O in the word, not at position 3 (from ""woozy"" and ""woofy"" feedback, where the second O was marked ""-"").
- **Word Pattern**: The secret word is of the form `_ O _ _ Y`.
- **Available Letters**: D, H, J, K, O, Q, V, W, X (O and W are confirmed present but not fully positioned).

### Key Constraints:
- Position 1: Cannot be W (per feedback) and must be one of the available letters (D, H, J, K, Q, V, X, or O).
- Position 3: Cannot be O (per feedback) and must be one of the available letters (D, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X).
- Position 4: Must be one of the available letters (D, H, J, K, O, Q, V, W, X) and likely contains the second O or W.
- The word must contain at least two O's (positions 2 and one other) and W (not at position 1).

### Reasoning for the Next Guess:
- Given the constraints, the only feasible pattern is `? O ? ? Y` with the second O at position 1 or 4, and W at position 3 or 4.
- Common words are scarce due to the limited letter pool and pattern. After evaluating options:
  - `HOWDY` (H O W D Y) is a valid word that tests:
    - Position 1: H (new letter, could be present or absent).
    - Position 3: W (tests if W is at position 3; if present, feedback will confirm or deny).
    - Position 4: D (new letter, could be present or absent).
    - It also challenges the O-count: if `HOWDY` is correct, it would imply only one O (contradicting prior feedback), but this guess will clarify if the secret word has exactly one O or if our deduction of two O's is correct.
- If `HOWDY` is incorrect, feedback on H, W, and D will provide critical information to resolve the word in the next guess.",Guess 6: howdy -> FEEDBACK: H(✓) O(✓) W(✓) D(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
