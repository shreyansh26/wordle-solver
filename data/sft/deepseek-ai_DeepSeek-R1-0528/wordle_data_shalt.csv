We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 - C: x (not in the word)
 - R: x (not in the word)
 - A: ✓ (correct position, so A is the second letter of the secret word? Because in ""crane"", A is the third letter? Wait, let me index:

 ""c r a n e"" -> positions: 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E

 Feedback:
   C(x) -> letter C is not in the word
   R(x) -> letter R is not in the word
   A(✓) -> letter A is in the word and in the correct position (so the third letter is A)
   N(x) -> N is not in the word
   E(x) -> E is not in the word

 So we know:
   The third letter of the secret word is A.
   The word contains 'A' but does NOT contain C, R, N, E.

 We must avoid letters: C, R, N, E.

 Since we know the third letter is A, we can focus on words that have A as the third letter and avoid the excluded letters.

 Also, we don't have any other information about the word. So we guess another word that might test some common letters.

 We should try to cover more common consonants and vowels. Since we know A is fixed at position 3, we can look for a word that has A in the third position and uses new letters.

 Common letters to try: T, S, L, P, H, D, O, I, etc.

 Let's form a word with the pattern: _ _ A _ _

 We want to avoid C, R, N, E.

 Example words: 
   ""palsy"" -> but we don't know if we want to use Y? Maybe try more common ones.
   ""salts"" -> duplicate letter S? We want as many new letters as possible.
   ""fault"" -> F and U? Not bad.

 However, we don't have any other constraints. So let's pick one that uses common letters.

 How about ""PLANT""? But we know N is excluded (from feedback: N(x)), so no.

 Some words with A in the third position:
   ""balmy"" -> B,A,L,M,Y -> avoids C,R,N,E. But Y is less common.
   ""halt"" -> too short.
   ""malls"" -> duplicate L and not 5 letters? ""malls"" is 5 letters: M,A,L,L,S -> but duplicate L. Better avoid duplicates for now.

 Alternatively, we can consider words that have A in the third position without using excluded letters.

 Possibilities: 
   ""DAILY"" -> D,A,I,L,Y -> avoids C,R,N,E. Let's check: D is common, I and L are common.
   ""HASTY"" -> H,A,S,T,Y -> common letters? H,A,S,T,Y. But we are using Y again.

 Maybe ""PASTA""? But we know A is already in the third position, but in ""PASTA"": P,A,S,T,A -> the third letter is S? Wait:
   P A S T A -> positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:S, 4:T, 5:A -> but we need third letter to be A? So no.

 We must have A as the third letter.

 So pattern: _ _ A _ _

 Let me think: 
   ""table"" -> T,A,B,L,E -> but E is excluded? feedback said E(x). So no E.
   ""basil"" -> B,A,S,I,L -> this has A as the second letter? No: B(1), A(2), so no.

 Words with A in third position:
   ""stain"" -> S,T,A,I,N -> but N is excluded? Yes, feedback N(x). Avoid.
   ""train"" -> T,R,A,I,N -> but R and N excluded? Avoid.
   ""plaid"" -> P,L,A,I,D -> avoids excluded letters? R not in excluded? R is excluded? Feedback: R(x) -> so R is excluded, but P,L,A,I,D: no C,R,N,E? Yes, avoids them.

 So ""plaid"" is a candidate: P, L, A, I, D.

 But note: the word does not have R, so that's okay.

 Another candidate: ""flail"" -> F,L,A,I,L -> duplicate L? And L appears twice. Not ideal.

 How about ""soapy"" -> S,O,A,P,Y -> O is a vowel, but pattern: S(1),O(2),A(3) -> yes? Then P(4), Y(5). Avoids excluded letters.

 Another: ""whack"" -> W,H,A,C,K -> but C is excluded? Yes, C is excluded (from feedback: C(x)). So no.

 Another: ""thank"" -> T,H,A,N,K -> includes N and H? N is excluded.

 Let's list: 
   We need a word: _ _ A _ _ 
   with letters that are not in [C, R, N, E]

 Some words:
   ""valid"" -> V,A,L,I,D -> but A is second? V(1),A(2),L(3) -> not A at third.
   ""faint"" -> F,A,I,N,T -> excludes? N is excluded -> no.

 Another one: ""salad"" -> S,A,L,A,D -> has A at second and fourth? S(1),A(2),L(3),A(4),D(5) -> so third letter L? No, third is L.

 We need third letter A: so the word is like: first letter ?, second letter ?, third letter A, fourth letter ?, fifth letter ?.

 So pattern: [letter1][letter2]A[letter4][letter5]

 And letter1, letter2, letter4, letter5 cannot be C, R, N, E, and also not A? Wait, A is already known, but can it appear again? The feedback for A was only one and correct. But that doesn't mean there can't be another A? However, we don't have information. So it might appear again? But we don't want to assume duplicates.

 For maximum information, we guess new letters and avoid duplicates if possible.

 So let's try a word with distinct letters that we haven't tried yet, and avoid excluded ones.

 Possible letters: we've used C,R,A,N,E so exclude those. Then new letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

 We need five distinct letters and A at position 3.

 Let me try: 
   Letter1: T (high frequency)
   Letter2: O (high frequency vowel)
   Then A at position 3.
   Letter4: P (common consonant)
   Letter5: S (common letter)

 So word: T O A P S -> ""topas""? That's not a word? Maybe ""tapis""? But that means tapestry? Not common.

 Alternatively: ""toast"" -> T,O,A,S,T -> duplicate T? And S? But we have T twice? Also, we have A at third? T(1),O(2),A(3),S(4),T(5) -> duplicate T? And checks: T,O,A,S,T -> avoids C,R,N,E? Yes? But duplicate T? Since it's valid word? Yes, ""toast"" is a valid word.

 However, feedback for duplicates: but we don't know if secret word has duplicate. So it's okay to guess duplicates? But if we avoid, we might get more information.

 Alternatively: ""pilot"" -> P,I,L,O,T -> but third letter L? Not A.

 How about ""koala"" -> K,O,A,L,A -> third letter A? Yes: K,O,A,L,A -> but duplicates A? And avoids excluded? Yes, letters: K,O,A,L,A -> excludes C,R,N,E? Yes. But duplicate A? We are not sure.

 Alternatively: ""modal"" -> M,O,D,A,L -> again A at fourth? M,O,D,A,L: positions: 1:M,2:O,3:D,4:A,5:L -> not at third.

 We need the third letter to be A.

 How about ""sofas"" -> S,O,F,A,S -> third letter F? Not A.

 Another: ""cabal""? But C is excluded.

 One that comes to mind: ""AWAIT"" -> A,W,A,I,T -> first letter A? And third letter A? But we don't know if A is at first? Anyway, pattern: 1:A, 2:W, 3:A, 4:I, 5:T -> but third is A? Yes. But we have A at first as well? And we haven't tested A in first position? Actually, we know from first guess that A is at third? But that doesn't mean A cannot be elsewhere. However, we want to test new positions? Also, we haven't used W, I, T.

 But we know the word has A at third? We don't know about other As? So it's okay.

 However, ""await"" uses two A's? Also, first letter A? We don't know if it's in the word elsewhere? But it might be, and we already have the third letter, so we could use a word without duplicates? Let's try to find without duplicates.

 How about ""basal""? B,A,S,A,L -> duplicates A? Not ideal.

 Another: ""fatal"" -> F,A,T,A,L -> duplicates.

 Perhaps it's hard? Let me try ""koala""? But duplicates? Or ""oasis"" -> third letter A? O(1),A(2),S(3) -> no.

 What about ""habit""? H,A,B,I,T -> third letter B? Not A.

 ""panic"" -> P,A,N,I,C -> but N and C excluded? No.

 Another word: ""patio"" -> P,A,T,I,O -> third letter T? Not A.

 I found: ""manor"" -> M,A,N,O,R -> but R and N excluded? R(x) and N(x) -> avoid.

 ""papas"" -> duplicates P and A? and third letter P? Not A.

 ""salad"" -> S,A,L,A,D -> duplicate A? and third letter L? Not A.

 Wait, I think I recall: ""staid"" -> S,T,A,I,D -> third letter A? Yes: S(1),T(2),A(3),I(4),D(5). And avoids excluded letters? Excluded: C,R,N,E -> letters in ""staid"": S,T,A,I,D -> none of these are in the excluded list.

 So ""staid"" is a valid word? And S,T,I,D are new.

 Also, we don't have duplicates? So we guess ""staid""?

 Sometimes ""staid"" is used.

 Alternatively: ""plain"" -> P,L,A,I,N -> includes N? Excluded? N is excluded? Yes, from feedback -> avoid.

 Another: ""quail"" -> Q,U,A,I,L -> third letter A? Yes. Letters: Q,U,A,I,L -> avoids C,R,N,E? Yes. And distinct? Yes.

 But Q is less common? Maybe not.

 How about ""spail""? Not word? Valid?

 Instead, let me search for a word that ends with ""aky"": ""janky""? Not.

 Another: ""baked"" -> B,A,K,E,D -> E excluded? Avoid.

 So ""staid"" seems acceptable.

 But note: we have A at third? Yes. And letters S,T,I,D are not excluded? Correct.

 Therefore, a good guess is ""staid"".

 But let's double-check: S(1), T(2), A(3), I(4), D(5). Yes.

 And excludes: C,R,N,E? Yes.

 So I will guess ""staid"".

 However, wait: in the first guess ""crane"", we had R and that was at position 2? And we were told R is not in the word. So R is excluded? Yes. Also N and E are excluded.

 So ""staid"" has D? We haven't tested D? And S,T? Yes.

 This might be a good choice.

 Alternatively, if we want more vowels? We have I as a vowel? Also, we can try ""oasis"" but can't because third letter is S.

 How about ""adios""? A(1),D(2),I(3),O(4),S(5) -> third letter I? Not A.

 Another word: ""stair"" -> S,T,A,I,R -> includes R? Excluded? R is excluded? Yes, avoid.

 So ""staid"" is acceptable.

 Therefore, second guess: ""staid""

<guess>staid</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **Feedback**: C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(x)
- **Key insights**:
  - The third letter of the secret word is **A**.
  - Letters **C, R, N,** and **E** are **not** in the secret word.
- **New guess strategy**:
  - Focus on words with **A in the third position** (pattern: `_ _ A _ _`).
  - Avoid reused letters (C, R, N, E) and use new, common letters to maximize information.
  - Prioritize distinct letters over duplicates to test more possibilities.
  - Valid candidates: ""staid"" (S, T, A, I, D), which fits the pattern, uses unused common letters, and avoids excluded characters.

This guess will help test new consonants (S, T, D) and the vowel (I).

<guess>staid</guess>",staid,"We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 - C: x (not in the word)
 - R: x (not in the word)
 - A: ✓ (correct position, so A is the second letter of the secret word? Because in ""crane"", A is the third letter? Wait, let me index:

 Feedback:
   C(x) -> letter C is not in the word

   A(✓) -> letter A is in the word and in the correct position (so the third letter is A)

 So we know:
   The third letter of the secret word is A.
   The word contains 'A' but does NOT contain C, R, N, E.

 We must avoid letters: C, R, N, E.

 Since we know the third letter is A, we can focus on words that have A as the third letter and avoid the excluded letters.

 Maybe ""PASTA""? But we know A is already in the third position, but in ""PASTA"": P,A,S,T,A -> the third letter is S? Wait:
   P A S T A -> positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:S, 4:T, 5:A -> but we need third letter to be A? So no.

 We must have A as the third letter.

 So pattern: _ _ A _ _

 Let me think: 
   ""table"" -> T,A,B,L,E -> but E is excluded? feedback said E(x). So no E.
   ""basil"" -> B,A,S,I,L -> this has A as the second letter? No: B(1), A(2), so no.

 Another: ""thank"" -> T,H,A,N,K -> includes N and H? N is excluded.

 Let's list: 
   We need a word: _ _ A _ _ 
   with letters that are not in [C, R, N, E]

 Some words:
   ""valid"" -> V,A,L,I,D -> but A is second? V(1),A(2),L(3) -> not A at third.

 Another one: ""salad"" -> S,A,L,A,D -> has A at second and fourth? S(1),A(2),L(3),A(4),D(5) -> so third letter L? No, third is L.

 We need third letter A: so the word is like: first letter ?, second letter ?, third letter A, fourth letter ?, fifth letter ?.

 So pattern: [letter1][letter2]A[letter4][letter5]

 And letter1, letter2, letter4, letter5 cannot be C, R, N, E, and also not A? Wait, A is already known, but can it appear again? The feedback for A was only one and correct. But that doesn't mean there can't be another A? However, we don't have information. So it might appear again? But we don't want to assume duplicates.

 For maximum information, we guess new letters and avoid duplicates if possible.

 Possible letters: we've used C,R,A,N,E so exclude those. Then new letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

 We need five distinct letters and A at position 3.

 Let me try: 
   Letter1: T (high frequency)
   Letter2: O (high frequency vowel)
   Then A at position 3.
   Letter4: P (common consonant)
   Letter5: S (common letter)

 So word: T O A P S -> ""topas""? That's not a word? Maybe ""tapis""? But that means tapestry? Not common.

 Alternatively: ""toast"" -> T,O,A,S,T -> duplicate T? And S? But we have T twice? Also, we have A at third? T(1),O(2),A(3),S(4),T(5) -> duplicate T? And checks: T,O,A,S,T -> avoids C,R,N,E? Yes? But duplicate T? Since it's valid word? Yes, ""toast"" is a valid word.

 However, feedback for duplicates: but we don't know if secret word has duplicate. So it's okay to guess duplicates? But if we avoid, we might get more information.

 Alternatively: ""pilot"" -> P,I,L,O,T -> but third letter L? Not A.

 How about ""koala"" -> K,O,A,L,A -> third letter A? Yes: K,O,A,L,A -> but duplicates A? And avoids excluded? Yes, letters: K,O,A,L,A -> excludes C,R,N,E? Yes. But duplicate A? We are not sure.

 Alternatively: ""modal"" -> M,O,D,A,L -> again A at fourth? M,O,D,A,L: positions: 1:M,2:O,3:D,4:A,5:L -> not at third.

 We need the third letter to be A.

 How about ""sofas"" -> S,O,F,A,S -> third letter F? Not A.

 Another: ""cabal""? But C is excluded.

 One that comes to mind: ""AWAIT"" -> A,W,A,I,T -> first letter A? And third letter A? But we don't know if A is at first? Anyway, pattern: 1:A, 2:W, 3:A, 4:I, 5:T -> but third is A? Yes.

 Another word: ""patio"" -> P,A,T,I,O -> third letter T? Not A.

 I found: ""manor"" -> M,A,N,O,R -> but R and N excluded? R(x) and N(x) -> avoid.

 ""papas"" -> duplicates P and A? and third letter P? Not A.

 ""salad"" -> S,A,L,A,D -> duplicate A? and third letter L? Not A.

 Wait, I think I recall: ""staid"" -> S,T,A,I,D -> third letter A? Yes: S(1),T(2),A(3),I(4),D(5). And avoids excluded letters? Excluded: C,R,N,E -> letters in ""staid"": S,T,A,I,D -> none of these are in the excluded list.

 So ""staid"" is a valid word? And S,T,I,D are new.

 Also, we don't have duplicates? So we guess ""staid""?

 Sometimes ""staid"" is used.

 Alternatively: ""plain"" -> P,L,A,I,N -> includes N? Excluded? N is excluded? Yes, from feedback -> avoid.

 Another: ""quail"" -> Q,U,A,I,L -> third letter A? Yes. Letters: Q,U,A,I,L -> avoids C,R,N,E? Yes. And distinct? Yes.

 But Q is less common? Maybe not.

 How about ""spail""? Not word? Valid?

 Instead, let me search for a word that ends with ""aky"": ""janky""? Not.

 Another: ""baked"" -> B,A,K,E,D -> E excluded? Avoid.

 So ""staid"" seems acceptable.

 But note: we have A at third? Yes. And letters S,T,I,D are not excluded? Correct.

 Therefore, a good guess is ""staid"".

 But let's double-check: S(1), T(2), A(3), I(4), D(5). Yes.

 And excludes: C,R,N,E? Yes.

 So I will guess ""staid"".

 However, wait: in the first guess ""crane"", we had R and that was at position 2? And we were told R is not in the word. So R is excluded? Yes. Also N and E are excluded.

 So ""staid"" has D? We haven't tested D? And S,T? Yes.

 This might be a good choice.

 Alternatively, if we want more vowels? We have I as a vowel? Also, we can try ""oasis"" but can't because third letter is S.

 How about ""adios""? A(1),D(2),I(3),O(4),S(5) -> third letter I? Not A.

 Another word: ""stair"" -> S,T,A,I,R -> includes R? Excluded? R is excluded? Yes, avoid.

 So ""staid"" is acceptable.

 Therefore, second guess: ""staid""

<guess>staid</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **Feedback**: C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(x)
- **Key insights**:
  - The third letter of the secret word is **A**.
  - Letters **C, R, N,** and **E** are **not** in the secret word.
- **New guess strategy**:
  - Focus on words with **A in the third position** (pattern: `_ _ A _ _`).
  - Avoid reused letters (C, R, N, E) and use new, common letters to maximize information.
  - Prioritize distinct letters over duplicates to test more possibilities.
  - Valid candidates: ""staid"" (S, T, A, I, D), which fits the pattern, uses unused common letters, and avoids excluded characters.

This guess will help test new consonants (S, T, D) and the vowel (I).",Guess 2: staid -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(-) A(✓) I(x) D(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,shalt,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E which are common and cover vowels and consonants.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 - C: x (not in the word)
 - R: x (not in the word)
 - A: ✓ (correct position, so A is the second letter of the secret word? Because in ""crane"", A is the third letter? Wait, let me index:

 ""c r a n e"" -> positions: 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E

 Feedback:
   C(x) -> letter C is not in the word
   R(x) -> letter R is not in the word
   A(✓) -> letter A is in the word and in the correct position (so the third letter is A)
   N(x) -> N is not in the word
   E(x) -> E is not in the word

 So we know:
   The third letter of the secret word is A.
   The word contains 'A' but does NOT contain C, R, N, E.

 We must avoid letters: C, R, N, E.

 Since we know the third letter is A, we can focus on words that have A as the third letter and avoid the excluded letters.

 Also, we don't have any other information about the word. So we guess another word that might test some common letters.

 We should try to cover more common consonants and vowels. Since we know A is fixed at position 3, we can look for a word that has A in the third position and uses new letters.

 Common letters to try: T, S, L, P, H, D, O, I, etc.

 Let's form a word with the pattern: _ _ A _ _

 We want to avoid C, R, N, E.

 Example words: 
   ""palsy"" -> but we don't know if we want to use Y? Maybe try more common ones.
   ""salts"" -> duplicate letter S? We want as many new letters as possible.
   ""fault"" -> F and U? Not bad.

 However, we don't have any other constraints. So let's pick one that uses common letters.

 How about ""PLANT""? But we know N is excluded (from feedback: N(x)), so no.

 Some words with A in the third position:
   ""balmy"" -> B,A,L,M,Y -> avoids C,R,N,E. But Y is less common.
   ""halt"" -> too short.
   ""malls"" -> duplicate L and not 5 letters? ""malls"" is 5 letters: M,A,L,L,S -> but duplicate L. Better avoid duplicates for now.

 Alternatively, we can consider words that have A in the third position without using excluded letters.

 Possibilities: 
   ""DAILY"" -> D,A,I,L,Y -> avoids C,R,N,E. Let's check: D is common, I and L are common.
   ""HASTY"" -> H,A,S,T,Y -> common letters? H,A,S,T,Y. But we are using Y again.

 Maybe ""PASTA""? But we know A is already in the third position, but in ""PASTA"": P,A,S,T,A -> the third letter is S? Wait:
   P A S T A -> positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:S, 4:T, 5:A -> but we need third letter to be A? So no.

 We must have A as the third letter.

 So pattern: _ _ A _ _

 Let me think: 
   ""table"" -> T,A,B,L,E -> but E is excluded? feedback said E(x). So no E.
   ""basil"" -> B,A,S,I,L -> this has A as the second letter? No: B(1), A(2), so no.

 Words with A in third position:
   ""stain"" -> S,T,A,I,N -> but N is excluded? Yes, feedback N(x). Avoid.
   ""train"" -> T,R,A,I,N -> but R and N excluded? Avoid.
   ""plaid"" -> P,L,A,I,D -> avoids excluded letters? R not in excluded? R is excluded? Feedback: R(x) -> so R is excluded, but P,L,A,I,D: no C,R,N,E? Yes, avoids them.

 So ""plaid"" is a candidate: P, L, A, I, D.

 But note: the word does not have R, so that's okay.

 Another candidate: ""flail"" -> F,L,A,I,L -> duplicate L? And L appears twice. Not ideal.

 How about ""soapy"" -> S,O,A,P,Y -> O is a vowel, but pattern: S(1),O(2),A(3) -> yes? Then P(4), Y(5). Avoids excluded letters.

 Another: ""whack"" -> W,H,A,C,K -> but C is excluded? Yes, C is excluded (from feedback: C(x)). So no.

 Another: ""thank"" -> T,H,A,N,K -> includes N and H? N is excluded.

 Let's list: 
   We need a word: _ _ A _ _ 
   with letters that are not in [C, R, N, E]

 Some words:
   ""valid"" -> V,A,L,I,D -> but A is second? V(1),A(2),L(3) -> not A at third.
   ""faint"" -> F,A,I,N,T -> excludes? N is excluded -> no.

 Another one: ""salad"" -> S,A,L,A,D -> has A at second and fourth? S(1),A(2),L(3),A(4),D(5) -> so third letter L? No, third is L.

 We need third letter A: so the word is like: first letter ?, second letter ?, third letter A, fourth letter ?, fifth letter ?.

 So pattern: [letter1][letter2]A[letter4][letter5]

 And letter1, letter2, letter4, letter5 cannot be C, R, N, E, and also not A? Wait, A is already known, but can it appear again? The feedback for A was only one and correct. But that doesn't mean there can't be another A? However, we don't have information. So it might appear again? But we don't want to assume duplicates.

 For maximum information, we guess new letters and avoid duplicates if possible.

 So let's try a word with distinct letters that we haven't tried yet, and avoid excluded ones.

 Possible letters: we've used C,R,A,N,E so exclude those. Then new letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

 We need five distinct letters and A at position 3.

 Let me try: 
   Letter1: T (high frequency)
   Letter2: O (high frequency vowel)
   Then A at position 3.
   Letter4: P (common consonant)
   Letter5: S (common letter)

 So word: T O A P S -> ""topas""? That's not a word? Maybe ""tapis""? But that means tapestry? Not common.

 Alternatively: ""toast"" -> T,O,A,S,T -> duplicate T? And S? But we have T twice? Also, we have A at third? T(1),O(2),A(3),S(4),T(5) -> duplicate T? And checks: T,O,A,S,T -> avoids C,R,N,E? Yes? But duplicate T? Since it's valid word? Yes, ""toast"" is a valid word.

 However, feedback for duplicates: but we don't know if secret word has duplicate. So it's okay to guess duplicates? But if we avoid, we might get more information.

 Alternatively: ""pilot"" -> P,I,L,O,T -> but third letter L? Not A.

 How about ""koala"" -> K,O,A,L,A -> third letter A? Yes: K,O,A,L,A -> but duplicates A? And avoids excluded? Yes, letters: K,O,A,L,A -> excludes C,R,N,E? Yes. But duplicate A? We are not sure.

 Alternatively: ""modal"" -> M,O,D,A,L -> again A at fourth? M,O,D,A,L: positions: 1:M,2:O,3:D,4:A,5:L -> not at third.

 We need the third letter to be A.

 How about ""sofas"" -> S,O,F,A,S -> third letter F? Not A.

 Another: ""cabal""? But C is excluded.

 One that comes to mind: ""AWAIT"" -> A,W,A,I,T -> first letter A? And third letter A? But we don't know if A is at first? Anyway, pattern: 1:A, 2:W, 3:A, 4:I, 5:T -> but third is A? Yes. But we have A at first as well? And we haven't tested A in first position? Actually, we know from first guess that A is at third? But that doesn't mean A cannot be elsewhere. However, we want to test new positions? Also, we haven't used W, I, T.

 But we know the word has A at third? We don't know about other As? So it's okay.

 However, ""await"" uses two A's? Also, first letter A? We don't know if it's in the word elsewhere? But it might be, and we already have the third letter, so we could use a word without duplicates? Let's try to find without duplicates.

 How about ""basal""? B,A,S,A,L -> duplicates A? Not ideal.

 Another: ""fatal"" -> F,A,T,A,L -> duplicates.

 Perhaps it's hard? Let me try ""koala""? But duplicates? Or ""oasis"" -> third letter A? O(1),A(2),S(3) -> no.

 What about ""habit""? H,A,B,I,T -> third letter B? Not A.

 ""panic"" -> P,A,N,I,C -> but N and C excluded? No.

 Another word: ""patio"" -> P,A,T,I,O -> third letter T? Not A.

 I found: ""manor"" -> M,A,N,O,R -> but R and N excluded? R(x) and N(x) -> avoid.

 ""papas"" -> duplicates P and A? and third letter P? Not A.

 ""salad"" -> S,A,L,A,D -> duplicate A? and third letter L? Not A.

 Wait, I think I recall: ""staid"" -> S,T,A,I,D -> third letter A? Yes: S(1),T(2),A(3),I(4),D(5). And avoids excluded letters? Excluded: C,R,N,E -> letters in ""staid"": S,T,A,I,D -> none of these are in the excluded list.

 So ""staid"" is a valid word? And S,T,I,D are new.

 Also, we don't have duplicates? So we guess ""staid""?

 Sometimes ""staid"" is used.

 Alternatively: ""plain"" -> P,L,A,I,N -> includes N? Excluded? N is excluded? Yes, from feedback -> avoid.

 Another: ""quail"" -> Q,U,A,I,L -> third letter A? Yes. Letters: Q,U,A,I,L -> avoids C,R,N,E? Yes. And distinct? Yes.

 But Q is less common? Maybe not.

 How about ""spail""? Not word? Valid?

 Instead, let me search for a word that ends with ""aky"": ""janky""? Not.

 Another: ""baked"" -> B,A,K,E,D -> E excluded? Avoid.

 So ""staid"" seems acceptable.

 But note: we have A at third? Yes. And letters S,T,I,D are not excluded? Correct.

 Therefore, a good guess is ""staid"".

 But let's double-check: S(1), T(2), A(3), I(4), D(5). Yes.

 And excludes: C,R,N,E? Yes.

 So I will guess ""staid"".

 However, wait: in the first guess ""crane"", we had R and that was at position 2? And we were told R is not in the word. So R is excluded? Yes. Also N and E are excluded.

 So ""staid"" has D? We haven't tested D? And S,T? Yes.

 This might be a good choice.

 Alternatively, if we want more vowels? We have I as a vowel? Also, we can try ""oasis"" but can't because third letter is S.

 How about ""adios""? A(1),D(2),I(3),O(4),S(5) -> third letter I? Not A.

 Another word: ""stair"" -> S,T,A,I,R -> includes R? Excluded? R is excluded? Yes, avoid.

 So ""staid"" is acceptable.

 Therefore, second guess: ""staid""

So it\'s okay.\n\n However, ""await"" uses two A\'s? Also, first letter A? We don\'t know if it\'s in the word elsewhere? But it might be, and we already have the third letter, so we could use a word without duplicates? Let\'s try to find without duplicates.\n\n How about ""basal""? B,A,S,A,L -> duplicates A? Not ideal.\n\n Another: ""fatal"" -> F,A,T,A,L -> duplicates.\n\n Perhaps it\'s hard? Let me try ""koala""? But duplicates? Or ""oasis"" -> third letter A? O(1),A(2),S(3) -> no.\n\n What about ""habit""? H,A,B,I,T -> third letter B? Not A.\n\n ""panic"" -> P,A,N,I,C -> but N and C excluded? No.\n\n Another word: ""patio"" -> P,A,T,I,O -> third letter T? Not A.\n\n I found: ""manor"" -> M,A,N,O,R -> but R and N excluded? R(x) and N(x) -> avoid.\n\n ""papas"" -> duplicates P and A? and third letter P? Not A.\n\n ""salad"" -> S,A,L,A,D -> duplicate A? and third letter L? Not A.\n\n Wait, I think I recall: ""staid"" -> S,T,A,I,D -> third letter A? Yes: S(1),T(2),A(3),I(4),D(5). And avoids excluded letters? Excluded: C,R,N,E -> letters in ""staid"": S,T,A,I,D -> none of these are in the excluded list.\n\n So ""staid"" is a valid word? And S,T,I,D are new.\n\n Also, we don\'t have duplicates? So we guess ""staid""?\n\n Sometimes ""staid"" is used.\n\n Alternatively: ""plain"" -> P,L,A,I,N -> includes N? Excluded? N is excluded? Yes, from feedback -> avoid.\n\n Another: ""quail"" -> Q,U,A,I,L -> third letter A? Yes. Letters: Q,U,A,I,L -> avoids C,R,N,E? Yes. And distinct? Yes.\n\n But Q is less common? Maybe not.\n\n How about ""spail""? Not word? Valid?\n\n Instead, let me search for a word that ends with ""aky"": ""janky""? Not.\n\n Another: ""baked"" -> B,A,K,E,D -> E excluded? Avoid.\n\n So ""staid"" seems acceptable.\n\n But note: we have A at third? Yes. And letters S,T,I,D are not excluded? Correct.\n\n Therefore, a good guess is ""staid"".\n\n But let\'s double-check: S(1), T(2), A(3), I(4), D(5). Yes.\n\n And excludes: C,R,N,E? Yes.\n\n So I will guess ""staid"".\n\n However, wait: in the first guess ""crane"", we had R and that was at position 2? And we were told R is not in the word. So R is excluded? Yes. Also N and E are excluded.\n\n So ""staid"" has D? We haven\'t tested D? And S,T? Yes.\n\n This might be a good choice.\n\n Alternatively, if we want more vowels? We have I as a vowel? Also, we can try ""oasis"" but can\'t because third letter is S.\n\n How about ""adios""? A(1),D(2),I(3),O(4),S(5) -> third letter I? Not A.\n\n Another word: ""stair"" -> S,T,A,I,R -> includes R? Excluded? R is excluded? Yes, avoid.\n\n So ""staid"" is acceptable.\n\n Therefore, second guess: ""staid""\n\n<guess>staid</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **Feedback**: C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(x)\n- **Key insights**:\n  - The third letter of the secret word is **A**.\n  - Letters **C, R, N,** and **E** are **not** in the secret word.\n- **New guess strategy**:\n  - Focus on words with **A in the third position** (pattern: `_ _ A _ _`).\n  - Avoid reused letters (C, R, N, E) and use new, common letters to maximize information.\n  - Prioritize distinct letters over duplicates to test more possibilities.\n  - Valid candidates: ""staid"" (S, T, A, I, D), which fits the pattern, uses unused common letters, and avoids excluded characters.\n\nThis guess will help test new consonants (S, T, D) and the vowel (I).\n\n<guess>staid</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: staid -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(-) A(✓) I(x) D(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback from the second guess ""staid"":
 - S: ✓ (correct position, so first letter is S)
 - T: - (in the word but wrong position)
 - A: ✓ (correct position, third letter is A, which we already knew)
 - I: x (not in the word)
 - D: x (not in the word)

 So now we know:
   The secret word starts with S and has A as the third letter: S _ A _ _
   The letter T is in the word, but not in the second position (since we got a '-' for T in position 2).
   Letters I and D are not in the word.

 Also, from the first guess, we know that C, R, N, E are not in the word.

 So total excluded letters: C, R, N, E, I, D.

 We have to use the fact that T is in the word but not in the second position. So T must be in the fourth or fifth position.

 Pattern: S _ A _ _

 And the word contains T (in position 4 or 5) and does not contain: C, R, N, E, I, D.

 We also have the letters we haven't tried: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We need to form a word that fits: S _ A T _  or S _ A _ T

 But note: the second position is open and must be filled with a letter that is not excluded and not T (because T is not in second position). Also, the last position (if T is in fourth, then fifth is open; if T in fifth, then fourth is open).

 Let's consider the two cases:

 Case 1: T is in the fourth position -> pattern: S _ A T _
   Then the second letter must be one of the available letters (not excluded and not T) and the fifth letter must be one of the available letters.

 Case 2: T is in the fifth position -> pattern: S _ A _ T
   Similarly, second and fourth positions to fill.

 We also want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Since we have limited guesses, we can try to cover multiple possibilities.

 However, note that we have only 4 guesses left (since we've used 2). We need to be efficient.

 Let's list possible words:

 For case 1: S _ A T _
   The second letter: can be B, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but must form a word)
   The fifth letter: similarly.

 Example words:
   ""swath"" -> S,W,A,T,H -> second letter W, fifth H -> avoids excluded? Yes. But we haven't tested W and H.
   ""scats"" -> but C excluded? Yes, avoid.
   ""seats"" -> E excluded? Avoid.
   ""slats"" -> L? and then T and S? But S is already at first? And T at fourth? But ""slats"" has two S? and two T? Also, L is new. But we have to avoid duplicates? Not necessarily, but we don't know if the word has duplicates. However, we are trying to get information.

   But note: we already know S is at first and A at third, and T at fourth? Then the word would be S L A T S? That's ""slats"", which is a word? But we have two S? and we know S is at first, so the last S would be a duplicate? But we don't know if duplicate S is allowed? Actually, the feedback for ""staid"" had S at first and it was correct, but that doesn't tell us about duplicates? However, we are guessing.

   But we have to avoid excluded letters: ""slats"" has S, L, A, T, S -> letters: S, L, A, T. We know A and T are in the word? But we don't know about L? And we haven't excluded L? So it's okay? But we are using S twice? We might get less information? Because if we get a duplicate S, we don't know if it's in the word twice? But we are trying to solve.

   Alternatively, we can avoid duplicates? Let's try to find without duplicates.

   ""swath"": S, W, A, T, H -> all distinct? Yes. And avoids excluded? Yes.

   ""splat"": S, P, L, A, T -> but T is at fifth? In ""splat"": S(1), P(2), L(3), A(4), T(5) -> but we need A at third? So no, in this word A is at fourth? So not matching pattern.

   For pattern S _ A T _:
     ""swath"": S(1), W(2), A(3), T(4), H(5) -> perfect.

   ""shaft"": S(1), H(2), A(3), F(4), T(5) -> but then T is at fifth? Wait, no: fourth is F? So T is at fifth? Then that would be case 2? 

   So for case 1 (T at fourth): 
        ""swath"" is one.

   ""scatt"" -> not a word? and C excluded.

   ""skate"": S(1), K(2), A(3), T(4), E(5) -> but E is excluded? Avoid.

   ""slate"": S(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5) -> E excluded? Avoid.

   ""sooty"": S(1), O(2), O(3) -> but we need A at third? So no.

   ""spats"": S(1), P(2), A(3), T(4), S(5) -> duplicate S? But we can use? But we are testing? And P is new.

   But we have ""swath"" as a candidate.

 Case 2: T at fifth: pattern S _ A _ T
   Then the second and fourth positions to fill.

   Example:
     ""soapt"": not a word? 
     ""saint"": S(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> but we need A at third? And I and N are excluded? Avoid.
     ""sault"": S(1), A(2), U(3), L(4), T(5) -> but A is at second? Not third.
     ""salty"": S(1), A(2), L(3), T(4), Y(5) -> but A at second? Not third.

   We need A at third? So the pattern is S _ A _ T -> so second letter is ?, third A, fourth ?, fifth T.

   ""seat"" -> too short.

   ""sabot"": S(1), A(2), B(3), O(4), T(5) -> A at second? Not third.

   How about ""scant"": S(1), C(2), A(3), N(4), T(5) -> but C and N excluded? Avoid.

   ""shaft"": S(1), H(2), A(3), F(4), T(5) -> but T is at fifth? So pattern: S H A F T -> which is ""shaft"". And avoids excluded? Letters: S, H, A, F, T -> no C,R,N,E,I,D? Yes. So ""shaft"" is a candidate? But wait, in ""shaft"", T is at fifth? So it fits case 2? But we also have case 1 candidate ""swath"".

   However, note: in ""shaft"", the T is at fifth? But we have a candidate for case 1: ""swath"" (T at fourth) and case 2: ""shaft"" (T at fifth). But we don't know which one? We need to choose a guess that can help us distinguish.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests both possibilities? But we have to fix the pattern.

   But note: we know T is in the word and not in second position? So it must be in fourth or fifth? We can try to cover both? But we have to choose one word.

   However, we can choose a word that has T in a position we haven't tested? But we only have positions 4 and 5 left? And we know it's not in 2? So it must be in 4 or 5? So we can try to guess a word that has T in one of these? But we don't know which? So we have to pick one? Or we can pick a word that doesn't have T in the second position? But we already know T is in the word? So we don't need to test T again? We just need to find its position.

   But we have two candidates: ""swath"" (T in fourth) and ""shaft"" (T in fifth). They are different.

   How about we choose a word that has T in the fourth position? Then if it's correct, we get T in fourth? Or if not, then T must be in fifth? But we have only one guess to test? Actually, we have 4 guesses left? But we are making the third guess.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses more new letters? And that might help us narrow down.

   Let me see: we have to fill the second position and either the fourth or fifth? But we don't know which? So we can try to use a word that has T in the fourth? Then if we get T in the correct position? Then we know? Or if we get T in the wrong position? Then it must be in fifth? But we already know T is in the word? So if we put T in fourth and it's correct? Then we get a check? If we put T in fourth and it's not correct? Then we get a minus? But we already have a minus for T in second? So if we put T in fourth and it's not correct, then we get a minus? Then we know T must be in fifth? So that's one way.

   But we can also choose a word that doesn't have T? But we know T is in the word? So we must include T? Because we are trying to find its position? And we have to use the known letters? Actually, we are not forced? But if we don't include T, then we might not get information about T's position? And we have to guess the entire word? So it's better to include T? Because we know it's in the word? So we can try to place it.

   So let's try ""swath"": 
        Pattern: S _ A T _ -> we are putting T in fourth? 
        If we get feedback: 
          If T is actually in fourth? Then we get T(✓) for fourth? 
          If T is in fifth? Then we get T(-) for fourth? because it's in the word but wrong position? Then we know it must be in fifth? 

   Also, we get information about the other letters: W and H? 

   Similarly, if we choose ""shaft"": 
        Pattern: S _ A _ T -> T in fifth?
        Then if T is in fifth? we get T(✓) for fifth? 
        If T is in fourth? we get T(-) for fifth? but wait, if T is in fourth and we put it in fifth? then we get a minus? and we know it's in fourth? 

   So both are good? But we have to choose one.

   Also, we have to consider that the second letter is unknown? In ""swath"", we are using W in second? In ""shaft"", we are using H in second? 

   We can also consider other words? 

   For case 1 (T in fourth): 
        Other words: 
          ""swath"" (as above)
          ""swats"" -> S,W,A,T,S -> duplicate S? But we know S is at first? So if the word has two S? But we don't know? And we are testing? But we get less information? 
          ""spats"" -> S,P,A,T,S -> duplicate S? 
          ""skate"" -> but E excluded? 
          ""slate"" -> E excluded? 
          ""smalt"" -> S,M,A,L,T -> distinct? Yes. And avoids excluded? M and L are new? So ""smalt"" is a word? It means a type of glass? 

   For case 2 (T in fifth): 
        ""shaft"" (as above)
        ""scatt"" -> not a word? 
        ""splat"" -> but T is at fifth? and A at fourth? So not? 
        ""sweat"" -> S,W,E,A,T -> but E excluded? 
        ""sight"" -> S,I,G,H,T -> but I excluded? 
        ""sought"" -> too long? 
        ""sault"" -> but A at second? 
        ""softa"" -> S,O,F,T,A -> but A at fifth? and T at fourth? So not? 

   Another: ""shalt"" -> S,H,A,L,T -> but T is at fifth? So pattern: S H A L T -> which is ""shalt"". And avoids excluded? Letters: S,H,A,L,T -> no C,R,N,E,I,D? Yes. So ""shalt"" is a candidate for case 2? 

   But in ""shalt"": 
        S(1), H(2), A(3), L(4), T(5) -> so T is at fifth? 

   So we have:
        Case 1: ""swath"", ""smalt""
        Case 2: ""shaft"", ""shalt""

   We can choose one that uses more common letters? Or that tests more new letters? 

   We have to test the second letter? And also the last letter? 

   Let's compare:
        ""swath"": tests W and H? 
        ""smalt"": tests M and L? 
        ""shaft"": tests H and F? 
        ""shalt"": tests H and L? 

   We have two candidates with H? 

   Also, note that in ""shaft"" and ""shalt"", we are using H in the second position? So if we get feedback that H is in the word? Then we know? 

   But we don't know if H is in the word? 

   Similarly, for W, M, L, F? 

   We want to maximize information? 

   How about we choose a word that has letters that are common? 

   Common consonants: T, S, L, D, N, M, ... but D and N excluded? So L, M, H, F, etc.

   Let's choose ""swath"" because it uses two new letters (W and H) and we get to test T in fourth? 

   Or ""shaft"" because it uses H and F? 

   But we have to decide? 

   Alternatively, we can avoid using H in two different positions? 

   Since we don't have much information about the second letter, we can try a word that uses a vowel in the second position? Because we have only one vowel so far (A)? And we excluded E and I? So remaining vowels: O, U, and sometimes Y? 

   For case 1: S _ A T _ 
        We can try: ""sooty"" -> but third letter O? Not A? 
        ""south"" -> S,O,U,T,H -> but third letter U? Not A? 
        ""sowth"" -> not a word? 

   For case 2: S _ A _ T
        ""south"" -> S,O,U,T,H -> but T is at fourth? and H at fifth? So pattern: S O A U T? -> no, because we need A at third? So ""south"" is S(1),O(2),U(3),T(4),H(5) -> third is U? Not A? 

   ""soapy"" -> S,O,A,P,Y -> but then T is not included? We must include T? Because we know T is in the word? 

   So we have to include T? 

   Therefore, we go back to the candidates: ""swath"", ""smalt"", ""shaft"", ""shalt"".

   I think ""swath"" is a good choice? Because it uses common letters? 

   But let's check frequency: 
        W is less common? 
        H is common? 

   Alternatively, ""shaft"" is a common word? 

   How about ""shalt""? It's a word? 

   We can choose ""shaft"" because it's a common word? 

   But note: in ""shaft"", we are putting T at fifth? And we don't know if T is at fourth or fifth? 

   We can also consider: we have to avoid the excluded letters? 

   Let me choose ""shaft"" as the guess? 

   But wait: in ""shaft"", the second letter is H? And we don't know if H is in the word? 

   Similarly, in ""swath"", second letter is W? 

   We can also consider: we have the letter T to place? 

   Since we have two cases, we can choose a word that doesn't commit to one? But we have to? 

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has T in a position that is not second? But we don't know? 

   I think we have to choose one? 

   Let's go with ""shaft"" because it's a common word? 

   But note: if we choose ""shaft"", and if T is actually in fourth? Then we will get T in fifth as a minus? And then we know T is in fourth? 

   Similarly, if we choose ""swath"", and if T is in fifth? Then we get T in fourth as a minus? 

   So both are acceptable? 

   But we also get information about the other letters? 

   I'll choose ""shaft"" because it uses H and F? which are common? 

   So guess: ""shaft""

   But let's write it: S H A F T

   However, we must check: 
        First letter S: we know it's correct? So we expect a check? 
        Second letter H: we don't know? 
        Third letter A: correct? 
        Fourth letter F: we don't know? 
        Fifth letter T: we don't know? 

   We might get feedback that tells us about H, F, and T? 

   But we know T is in the word? So if we put T at fifth and it's not there? Then we get a minus? Meaning T is in the word but not at fifth? Then it must be at fourth? 

   So we can deduce? 

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has T in a position that we haven't tried? But we only have positions 4 and 5? 

   So I think it's okay? 

   But wait: what if the word has two T's? Then we might have T in both fourth and fifth? But we don't know? But that's rare? 

   We'll go with ""shaft"".

   However, let me see if there's a word that tests more letters? 

   Another candidate: ""swath"" tests W and H? 

   But we have to choose? 

   I'll go with ""shaft"".

   But note: we have excluded I and D? And we are using F? 

   So guess: ""shaft""

<guess>shaft</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

1. **First Guess: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)**  
   - **A** is in the word and **correctly placed at position 3**.  
   - **C, R, N, E** are **not** in the word.  

2. **Second Guess: ""staid"" → Feedback: S(✓) T(-) A(✓) I(x) D(x)**  
   - **S** is in the word and **correctly placed at position 1**.  
   - **T** is in the word but **wrong position** (cannot be at position 2).  
   - **A** is **confirmed at position 3** (redundant but consistent).  
   - **I** and **D** are **not** in the word.  

### Key Insights:
- **Secret word pattern**: `S _ A _ _` (S at start, A at position 3).  
- **Confirmed letters in word**: **S, A, T** (T is present but not at position 2).  
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, N, E, I, D.  
- **T's position**: Must be at **position 4 or 5** (since it can't be at 2).  
- **Available letters**: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

### Strategy for Third Guess:
- Prioritize words fitting `S _ A _ _` with **T in position 4 or 5**.  
- Test new high-frequency consonants (e.g., **H, F, L, M**) to maximize information.  
- Avoid excluded letters and reuse known letters (S, A, T) strategically.  
- **Optimal candidate**: **""shaft""** (S H A F T).  
  - Tests **T at position 5** (if wrong, T must be at position 4).  
  - Tests new letters **H** (position 2) and **F** (position 4).  
  - Uses distinct letters to cover more ground.  

<guess>shaft</guess>",shaft,"We are given feedback from the second guess ""staid"":
 - S: ✓ (correct position, so first letter is S)
 - T: - (in the word but wrong position)
 - A: ✓ (correct position, third letter is A, which we already knew)
 - I: x (not in the word)
 - D: x (not in the word)

 So now we know:
   The secret word starts with S and has A as the third letter: S _ A _ _
   The letter T is in the word, but not in the second position (since we got a '-' for T in position 2).
   Letters I and D are not in the word.

 Also, from the first guess, we know that C, R, N, E are not in the word.

 So total excluded letters: C, R, N, E, I, D.

 We have to use the fact that T is in the word but not in the second position. So T must be in the fourth or fifth position.

 Pattern: S _ A _ _

 And the word contains T (in position 4 or 5) and does not contain: C, R, N, E, I, D.

 We also have the letters we haven't tried: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We need to form a word that fits: S _ A T _  or S _ A _ T

 But note: the second position is open and must be filled with a letter that is not excluded and not T (because T is not in second position). Also, the last position (if T is in fourth, then fifth is open; if T in fifth, then fourth is open).

 Let's consider the two cases:

 Case 1: T is in the fourth position -> pattern: S _ A T _
   Then the second letter must be one of the available letters (not excluded and not T) and the fifth letter must be one of the available letters.

 Case 2: T is in the fifth position -> pattern: S _ A _ T
   Similarly, second and fourth positions to fill.

 We also want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Since we have limited guesses, we can try to cover multiple possibilities.

 However, note that we have only 4 guesses left (since we've used 2). We need to be efficient.

 Let's list possible words:

 For case 1: S _ A T _
   The second letter: can be B, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but must form a word)
   The fifth letter: similarly.

 Example words:
   ""swath"" -> S,W,A,T,H -> second letter W, fifth H -> avoids excluded? Yes. But we haven't tested W and H.
   ""scats"" -> but C excluded? Yes, avoid.
   ""seats"" -> E excluded? Avoid.
   ""slats"" -> L? and then T and S? But S is already at first? And T at fourth? But ""slats"" has two S? and two T? Also, L is new. But we have to avoid duplicates? Not necessarily, but we don't know if the word has duplicates. However, we are trying to get information.

   But note: we already know S is at first and A at third, and T at fourth? Then the word would be S L A T S? That's ""slats"", which is a word? But we have two S? and we know S is at first, so the last S would be a duplicate? But we don't know if duplicate S is allowed? Actually, the feedback for ""staid"" had S at first and it was correct, but that doesn't tell us about duplicates? However, we are guessing.

   But we have to avoid excluded letters: ""slats"" has S, L, A, T, S -> letters: S, L, A, T. We know A and T are in the word? But we don't know about L? And we haven't excluded L? So it's okay? But we are using S twice? We might get less information? Because if we get a duplicate S, we don't know if it's in the word twice? But we are trying to solve.

   Alternatively, we can avoid duplicates? Let's try to find without duplicates.

   ""swath"": S, W, A, T, H -> all distinct? Yes. And avoids excluded? Yes.

   ""splat"": S, P, L, A, T -> but T is at fifth? In ""splat"": S(1), P(2), L(3), A(4), T(5) -> but we need A at third? So no, in this word A is at fourth? So not matching pattern.

   For pattern S _ A T _:
     ""swath"": S(1), W(2), A(3), T(4), H(5) -> perfect.

   ""shaft"": S(1), H(2), A(3), F(4), T(5) -> but then T is at fifth? Wait, no: fourth is F? So T is at fifth? Then that would be case 2? 

   So for case 1 (T at fourth): 
        ""swath"" is one.

   ""scatt"" -> not a word? and C excluded.

   ""skate"": S(1), K(2), A(3), T(4), E(5) -> but E is excluded? Avoid.

   ""slate"": S(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5) -> E excluded? Avoid.

   ""sooty"": S(1), O(2), O(3) -> but we need A at third? So no.

   ""spats"": S(1), P(2), A(3), T(4), S(5) -> duplicate S? But we can use? But we are testing? And P is new.

   But we have ""swath"" as a candidate.

 Case 2: T at fifth: pattern S _ A _ T
   Then the second and fourth positions to fill.

   Example:
     ""soapt"": not a word? 
     ""saint"": S(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> but we need A at third? And I and N are excluded? Avoid.
     ""sault"": S(1), A(2), U(3), L(4), T(5) -> but A is at second? Not third.
     ""salty"": S(1), A(2), L(3), T(4), Y(5) -> but A at second? Not third.

   We need A at third? So the pattern is S _ A _ T -> so second letter is ?, third A, fourth ?, fifth T.

   ""seat"" -> too short.

   ""sabot"": S(1), A(2), B(3), O(4), T(5) -> A at second? Not third.

   How about ""scant"": S(1), C(2), A(3), N(4), T(5) -> but C and N excluded? Avoid.

   ""shaft"": S(1), H(2), A(3), F(4), T(5) -> but T is at fifth? So pattern: S H A F T -> which is ""shaft"". And avoids excluded? Letters: S, H, A, F, T -> no C,R,N,E,I,D? Yes. So ""shaft"" is a candidate? But wait, in ""shaft"", T is at fifth? So it fits case 2? But we also have case 1 candidate ""swath"".

   However, note: in ""shaft"", the T is at fifth? But we have a candidate for case 1: ""swath"" (T at fourth) and case 2: ""shaft"" (T at fifth). But we don't know which one? We need to choose a guess that can help us distinguish.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests both possibilities? But we have to fix the pattern.

   But note: we know T is in the word and not in second position? So it must be in fourth or fifth? We can try to cover both? But we have to choose one word.

   However, we can choose a word that has T in a position we haven't tested? But we only have positions 4 and 5 left? And we know it's not in 2? So it must be in 4 or 5? So we can try to guess a word that has T in one of these? But we don't know which? So we have to pick one? Or we can pick a word that doesn't have T in the second position? But we already know T is in the word? So we don't need to test T again? We just need to find its position.

   But we have two candidates: ""swath"" (T in fourth) and ""shaft"" (T in fifth). They are different.

   How about we choose a word that has T in the fourth position? Then if it's correct, we get T in fourth? Or if not, then T must be in fifth? But we have only one guess to test? Actually, we have 4 guesses left? But we are making the third guess.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses more new letters? And that might help us narrow down.

   Let me see: we have to fill the second position and either the fourth or fifth? But we don't know which? So we can try to use a word that has T in the fourth? Then if we get T in the correct position? Then we know? Or if we get T in the wrong position? Then it must be in fifth? But we already know T is in the word? So if we put T in fourth and it's correct? Then we get a check? If we put T in fourth and it's not correct? Then we get a minus? But we already have a minus for T in second? So if we put T in fourth and it's not correct, then we get a minus? Then we know T must be in fifth? So that's one way.

   But we can also choose a word that doesn't have T? But we know T is in the word? So we must include T? Because we are trying to find its position? And we have to use the known letters? Actually, we are not forced? But if we don't include T, then we might not get information about T's position? And we have to guess the entire word? So it's better to include T? Because we know it's in the word? So we can try to place it.

   So let's try ""swath"": 
        Pattern: S _ A T _ -> we are putting T in fourth? 
        If we get feedback: 
          If T is actually in fourth? Then we get T(✓) for fourth? 
          If T is in fifth? Then we get T(-) for fourth? because it's in the word but wrong position? Then we know it must be in fifth? 

   Also, we get information about the other letters: W and H? 

   Similarly, if we choose ""shaft"": 
        Pattern: S _ A _ T -> T in fifth?
        Then if T is in fifth? we get T(✓) for fifth? 
        If T is in fourth? we get T(-) for fifth? but wait, if T is in fourth and we put it in fifth? then we get a minus? and we know it's in fourth? 

   So both are good? But we have to choose one.

   Also, we have to consider that the second letter is unknown? In ""swath"", we are using W in second? In ""shaft"", we are using H in second? 

   We can also consider other words? 

   For case 1 (T in fourth): 
        Other words: 
          ""swath"" (as above)
          ""swats"" -> S,W,A,T,S -> duplicate S? But we know S is at first? So if the word has two S? But we don't know? And we are testing? But we get less information? 
          ""spats"" -> S,P,A,T,S -> duplicate S? 
          ""skate"" -> but E excluded? 
          ""slate"" -> E excluded? 
          ""smalt"" -> S,M,A,L,T -> distinct? Yes. And avoids excluded? M and L are new? So ""smalt"" is a word? It means a type of glass? 

   For case 2 (T in fifth): 
        ""shaft"" (as above)
        ""scatt"" -> not a word? 
        ""splat"" -> but T is at fifth? and A at fourth? So not? 
        ""sweat"" -> S,W,E,A,T -> but E excluded? 
        ""sight"" -> S,I,G,H,T -> but I excluded? 
        ""sought"" -> too long? 
        ""sault"" -> but A at second? 
        ""softa"" -> S,O,F,T,A -> but A at fifth? and T at fourth? So not? 

   Another: ""shalt"" -> S,H,A,L,T -> but T is at fifth? So pattern: S H A L T -> which is ""shalt"". And avoids excluded? Letters: S,H,A,L,T -> no C,R,N,E,I,D? Yes. So ""shalt"" is a candidate for case 2? 

   But in ""shalt"": 
        S(1), H(2), A(3), L(4), T(5) -> so T is at fifth? 

   So we have:
        Case 1: ""swath"", ""smalt""
        Case 2: ""shaft"", ""shalt""

   We can choose one that uses more common letters? Or that tests more new letters? 

   We have to test the second letter? And also the last letter? 

   Let's compare:
        ""swath"": tests W and H? 
        ""smalt"": tests M and L? 
        ""shaft"": tests H and F? 
        ""shalt"": tests H and L? 

   We have two candidates with H? 

   Also, note that in ""shaft"" and ""shalt"", we are using H in the second position? So if we get feedback that H is in the word? Then we know? 

   But we don't know if H is in the word? 

   Similarly, for W, M, L, F? 

   We want to maximize information? 

   How about we choose a word that has letters that are common? 

   Common consonants: T, S, L, D, N, M, ... but D and N excluded? So L, M, H, F, etc.

   Let's choose ""swath"" because it uses two new letters (W and H) and we get to test T in fourth? 

   Or ""shaft"" because it uses H and F? 

   But we have to decide? 

   Alternatively, we can avoid using H in two different positions? 

   Since we don't have much information about the second letter, we can try a word that uses a vowel in the second position? Because we have only one vowel so far (A)? And we excluded E and I? So remaining vowels: O, U, and sometimes Y? 

   For case 1: S _ A T _ 
        We can try: ""sooty"" -> but third letter O? Not A? 
        ""south"" -> S,O,U,T,H -> but third letter U? Not A? 
        ""sowth"" -> not a word? 

   For case 2: S _ A _ T
        ""south"" -> S,O,U,T,H -> but T is at fourth? and H at fifth? So pattern: S O A U T? -> no, because we need A at third? So ""south"" is S(1),O(2),U(3),T(4),H(5) -> third is U? Not A? 

   ""soapy"" -> S,O,A,P,Y -> but then T is not included? We must include T? Because we know T is in the word? 

   So we have to include T? 

   Therefore, we go back to the candidates: ""swath"", ""smalt"", ""shaft"", ""shalt"".

   I think ""swath"" is a good choice? Because it uses common letters? 

   But let's check frequency: 
        W is less common? 
        H is common? 

   Alternatively, ""shaft"" is a common word? 

   How about ""shalt""? It's a word? 

   We can choose ""shaft"" because it's a common word? 

   But note: in ""shaft"", we are putting T at fifth? And we don't know if T is at fourth or fifth? 

   We can also consider: we have to avoid the excluded letters? 

   Let me choose ""shaft"" as the guess? 

   But wait: in ""shaft"", the second letter is H? And we don't know if H is in the word? 

   Similarly, in ""swath"", second letter is W? 

   We can also consider: we have the letter T to place? 

   Since we have two cases, we can choose a word that doesn't commit to one? But we have to? 

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has T in a position that is not second? But we don't know? 

   I think we have to choose one? 

   Let's go with ""shaft"" because it's a common word? 

   But note: if we choose ""shaft"", and if T is actually in fourth? Then we will get T in fifth as a minus? And then we know T is in fourth? 

   Similarly, if we choose ""swath"", and if T is in fifth? Then we get T in fourth as a minus? 

   So both are acceptable? 

   But we also get information about the other letters? 

   I'll choose ""shaft"" because it uses H and F? which are common? 

   So guess: ""shaft""

   But let's write it: S H A F T

   However, we must check: 
        First letter S: we know it's correct? So we expect a check? 
        Second letter H: we don't know? 
        Third letter A: correct? 
        Fourth letter F: we don't know? 
        Fifth letter T: we don't know? 

   We might get feedback that tells us about H, F, and T? 

   But we know T is in the word? So if we put T at fifth and it's not there? Then we get a minus? Meaning T is in the word but not at fifth? Then it must be at fourth? 

   So we can deduce? 

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has T in a position that we haven't tried? But we only have positions 4 and 5? 

   So I think it's okay? 

   But wait: what if the word has two T's? Then we might have T in both fourth and fifth? But we don't know? But that's rare? 

   We'll go with ""shaft"".

   However, let me see if there's a word that tests more letters? 

   Another candidate: ""swath"" tests W and H? 

   But we have to choose? 

   I'll go with ""shaft"".

   But note: we have excluded I and D? And we are using F? 

   So guess: ""shaft""

<guess>shaft</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

1. **First Guess: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)**  
   - **A** is in the word and **correctly placed at position 3**.  
   - **C, R, N, E** are **not** in the word.  

2. **Second Guess: ""staid"" → Feedback: S(✓) T(-) A(✓) I(x) D(x)**  
   - **S** is in the word and **correctly placed at position 1**.  
   - **T** is in the word but **wrong position** (cannot be at position 2).  
   - **A** is **confirmed at position 3** (redundant but consistent).  
   - **I** and **D** are **not** in the word.  

### Key Insights:
- **Secret word pattern**: `S _ A _ _` (S at start, A at position 3).  
- **Confirmed letters in word**: **S, A, T** (T is present but not at position 2).  
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, N, E, I, D.  
- **T's position**: Must be at **position 4 or 5** (since it can't be at 2).  
- **Available letters**: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

### Strategy for Third Guess:
- Prioritize words fitting `S _ A _ _` with **T in position 4 or 5**.  
- Test new high-frequency consonants (e.g., **H, F, L, M**) to maximize information.  
- Avoid excluded letters and reuse known letters (S, A, T) strategically.  
- **Optimal candidate**: **""shaft""** (S H A F T).  
  - Tests **T at position 5** (if wrong, T must be at position 4).  
  - Tests new letters **H** (position 2) and **F** (position 4).  
  - Uses distinct letters to cover more ground.",Guess 3: shaft -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(✓) A(✓) F(x) T(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,shalt,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E which are common and cover vowels and consonants.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 - C: x (not in the word)
 - R: x (not in the word)
 - A: ✓ (correct position, so A is the second letter of the secret word? Because in ""crane"", A is the third letter? Wait, let me index:

 ""c r a n e"" -> positions: 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E

 Feedback:
   C(x) -> letter C is not in the word
   R(x) -> letter R is not in the word
   A(✓) -> letter A is in the word and in the correct position (so the third letter is A)
   N(x) -> N is not in the word
   E(x) -> E is not in the word

 So we know:
   The third letter of the secret word is A.
   The word contains 'A' but does NOT contain C, R, N, E.

 We must avoid letters: C, R, N, E.

 Since we know the third letter is A, we can focus on words that have A as the third letter and avoid the excluded letters.

 Also, we don't have any other information about the word. So we guess another word that might test some common letters.

 We should try to cover more common consonants and vowels. Since we know A is fixed at position 3, we can look for a word that has A in the third position and uses new letters.

 Common letters to try: T, S, L, P, H, D, O, I, etc.

 Let's form a word with the pattern: _ _ A _ _

 We want to avoid C, R, N, E.

 Example words: 
   ""palsy"" -> but we don't know if we want to use Y? Maybe try more common ones.
   ""salts"" -> duplicate letter S? We want as many new letters as possible.
   ""fault"" -> F and U? Not bad.

 However, we don't have any other constraints. So let's pick one that uses common letters.

 How about ""PLANT""? But we know N is excluded (from feedback: N(x)), so no.

 Some words with A in the third position:
   ""balmy"" -> B,A,L,M,Y -> avoids C,R,N,E. But Y is less common.
   ""halt"" -> too short.
   ""malls"" -> duplicate L and not 5 letters? ""malls"" is 5 letters: M,A,L,L,S -> but duplicate L. Better avoid duplicates for now.

 Alternatively, we can consider words that have A in the third position without using excluded letters.

 Possibilities: 
   ""DAILY"" -> D,A,I,L,Y -> avoids C,R,N,E. Let's check: D is common, I and L are common.
   ""HASTY"" -> H,A,S,T,Y -> common letters? H,A,S,T,Y. But we are using Y again.

 Maybe ""PASTA""? But we know A is already in the third position, but in ""PASTA"": P,A,S,T,A -> the third letter is S? Wait:
   P A S T A -> positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:S, 4:T, 5:A -> but we need third letter to be A? So no.

 We must have A as the third letter.

 So pattern: _ _ A _ _

 Let me think: 
   ""table"" -> T,A,B,L,E -> but E is excluded? feedback said E(x). So no E.
   ""basil"" -> B,A,S,I,L -> this has A as the second letter? No: B(1), A(2), so no.

 Words with A in third position:
   ""stain"" -> S,T,A,I,N -> but N is excluded? Yes, feedback N(x). Avoid.
   ""train"" -> T,R,A,I,N -> but R and N excluded? Avoid.
   ""plaid"" -> P,L,A,I,D -> avoids excluded letters? R not in excluded? R is excluded? Feedback: R(x) -> so R is excluded, but P,L,A,I,D: no C,R,N,E? Yes, avoids them.

 So ""plaid"" is a candidate: P, L, A, I, D.

 But note: the word does not have R, so that's okay.

 Another candidate: ""flail"" -> F,L,A,I,L -> duplicate L? And L appears twice. Not ideal.

 How about ""soapy"" -> S,O,A,P,Y -> O is a vowel, but pattern: S(1),O(2),A(3) -> yes? Then P(4), Y(5). Avoids excluded letters.

 Another: ""whack"" -> W,H,A,C,K -> but C is excluded? Yes, C is excluded (from feedback: C(x)). So no.

 Another: ""thank"" -> T,H,A,N,K -> includes N and H? N is excluded.

 Let's list: 
   We need a word: _ _ A _ _ 
   with letters that are not in [C, R, N, E]

 Some words:
   ""valid"" -> V,A,L,I,D -> but A is second? V(1),A(2),L(3) -> not A at third.
   ""faint"" -> F,A,I,N,T -> excludes? N is excluded -> no.

 Another one: ""salad"" -> S,A,L,A,D -> has A at second and fourth? S(1),A(2),L(3),A(4),D(5) -> so third letter L? No, third is L.

 We need third letter A: so the word is like: first letter ?, second letter ?, third letter A, fourth letter ?, fifth letter ?.

 So pattern: [letter1][letter2]A[letter4][letter5]

 And letter1, letter2, letter4, letter5 cannot be C, R, N, E, and also not A? Wait, A is already known, but can it appear again? The feedback for A was only one and correct. But that doesn't mean there can't be another A? However, we don't have information. So it might appear again? But we don't want to assume duplicates.

 For maximum information, we guess new letters and avoid duplicates if possible.

 So let's try a word with distinct letters that we haven't tried yet, and avoid excluded ones.

 Possible letters: we've used C,R,A,N,E so exclude those. Then new letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

 We need five distinct letters and A at position 3.

 Let me try: 
   Letter1: T (high frequency)
   Letter2: O (high frequency vowel)
   Then A at position 3.
   Letter4: P (common consonant)
   Letter5: S (common letter)

 So word: T O A P S -> ""topas""? That's not a word? Maybe ""tapis""? But that means tapestry? Not common.

 Alternatively: ""toast"" -> T,O,A,S,T -> duplicate T? And S? But we have T twice? Also, we have A at third? T(1),O(2),A(3),S(4),T(5) -> duplicate T? And checks: T,O,A,S,T -> avoids C,R,N,E? Yes? But duplicate T? Since it's valid word? Yes, ""toast"" is a valid word.

 However, feedback for duplicates: but we don't know if secret word has duplicate. So it's okay to guess duplicates? But if we avoid, we might get more information.

 Alternatively: ""pilot"" -> P,I,L,O,T -> but third letter L? Not A.

 How about ""koala"" -> K,O,A,L,A -> third letter A? Yes: K,O,A,L,A -> but duplicates A? And avoids excluded? Yes, letters: K,O,A,L,A -> excludes C,R,N,E? Yes. But duplicate A? We are not sure.

 Alternatively: ""modal"" -> M,O,D,A,L -> again A at fourth? M,O,D,A,L: positions: 1:M,2:O,3:D,4:A,5:L -> not at third.

 We need the third letter to be A.

 How about ""sofas"" -> S,O,F,A,S -> third letter F? Not A.

 Another: ""cabal""? But C is excluded.

 One that comes to mind: ""AWAIT"" -> A,W,A,I,T -> first letter A? And third letter A? But we don't know if A is at first? Anyway, pattern: 1:A, 2:W, 3:A, 4:I, 5:T -> but third is A? Yes. But we have A at first as well? And we haven't tested A in first position? Actually, we know from first guess that A is at third? But that doesn't mean A cannot be elsewhere. However, we want to test new positions? Also, we haven't used W, I, T.

 But we know the word has A at third? We don't know about other As? So it's okay.

 However, ""await"" uses two A's? Also, first letter A? We don't know if it's in the word elsewhere? But it might be, and we already have the third letter, so we could use a word without duplicates? Let's try to find without duplicates.

 How about ""basal""? B,A,S,A,L -> duplicates A? Not ideal.

 Another: ""fatal"" -> F,A,T,A,L -> duplicates.

 Perhaps it's hard? Let me try ""koala""? But duplicates? Or ""oasis"" -> third letter A? O(1),A(2),S(3) -> no.

 What about ""habit""? H,A,B,I,T -> third letter B? Not A.

 ""panic"" -> P,A,N,I,C -> but N and C excluded? No.

 Another word: ""patio"" -> P,A,T,I,O -> third letter T? Not A.

 I found: ""manor"" -> M,A,N,O,R -> but R and N excluded? R(x) and N(x) -> avoid.

 ""papas"" -> duplicates P and A? and third letter P? Not A.

 ""salad"" -> S,A,L,A,D -> duplicate A? and third letter L? Not A.

 Wait, I think I recall: ""staid"" -> S,T,A,I,D -> third letter A? Yes: S(1),T(2),A(3),I(4),D(5). And avoids excluded letters? Excluded: C,R,N,E -> letters in ""staid"": S,T,A,I,D -> none of these are in the excluded list.

 So ""staid"" is a valid word? And S,T,I,D are new.

 Also, we don't have duplicates? So we guess ""staid""?

 Sometimes ""staid"" is used.

 Alternatively: ""plain"" -> P,L,A,I,N -> includes N? Excluded? N is excluded? Yes, from feedback -> avoid.

 Another: ""quail"" -> Q,U,A,I,L -> third letter A? Yes. Letters: Q,U,A,I,L -> avoids C,R,N,E? Yes. And distinct? Yes.

 But Q is less common? Maybe not.

 How about ""spail""? Not word? Valid?

 Instead, let me search for a word that ends with ""aky"": ""janky""? Not.

 Another: ""baked"" -> B,A,K,E,D -> E excluded? Avoid.

 So ""staid"" seems acceptable.

 But note: we have A at third? Yes. And letters S,T,I,D are not excluded? Correct.

 Therefore, a good guess is ""staid"".

 But let's double-check: S(1), T(2), A(3), I(4), D(5). Yes.

 And excludes: C,R,N,E? Yes.

 So I will guess ""staid"".

 However, wait: in the first guess ""crane"", we had R and that was at position 2? And we were told R is not in the word. So R is excluded? Yes. Also N and E are excluded.

 So ""staid"" has D? We haven't tested D? And S,T? Yes.

 This might be a good choice.

 Alternatively, if we want more vowels? We have I as a vowel? Also, we can try ""oasis"" but can't because third letter is S.

 How about ""adios""? A(1),D(2),I(3),O(4),S(5) -> third letter I? Not A.

 Another word: ""stair"" -> S,T,A,I,R -> includes R? Excluded? R is excluded? Yes, avoid.

 So ""staid"" is acceptable.

 Therefore, second guess: ""staid""

<guess>staid</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **Feedback**: C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(x)
- **Key insights**:
  - The third letter of the secret word is **A**.
  - Letters **C, R, N,** and **E** are **not** in the secret word.
- **New guess strategy**:
  - Focus on words with **A in the third position** (pattern: `_ _ A _ _`).
  - Avoid reused letters (C, R, N, E) and use new, common letters to maximize information.
  - Prioritize distinct letters over duplicates to test more possibilities.
  - Valid candidates: ""staid"" (S, T, A, I, D), which fits the pattern, uses unused common letters, and avoids excluded characters.

This guess will help test new consonants (S, T, D) and the vowel (I).

<guess>staid</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: staid -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(-) A(✓) I(x) D(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the second guess ""staid"":
 - S: ✓ (correct position, so first letter is S)
 - T: - (in the word but wrong position)
 - A: ✓ (correct position, third letter is A, which we already knew)
 - I: x (not in the word)
 - D: x (not in the word)

 So now we know:
   The secret word starts with S and has A as the third letter: S _ A _ _
   The letter T is in the word, but not in the second position (since we got a '-' for T in position 2).
   Letters I and D are not in the word.

 Also, from the first guess, we know that C, R, N, E are not in the word.

 So total excluded letters: C, R, N, E, I, D.

 We have to use the fact that T is in the word but not in the second position. So T must be in the fourth or fifth position.

 Pattern: S _ A _ _

 And the word contains T (in position 4 or 5) and does not contain: C, R, N, E, I, D.

 We also have the letters we haven't tried: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We need to form a word that fits: S _ A T _  or S _ A _ T

 But note: the second position is open and must be filled with a letter that is not excluded and not T (because T is not in second position). Also, the last position (if T is in fourth, then fifth is open; if T in fifth, then fourth is open).

 Let's consider the two cases:

 Case 1: T is in the fourth position -> pattern: S _ A T _
   Then the second letter must be one of the available letters (not excluded and not T) and the fifth letter must be one of the available letters.

 Case 2: T is in the fifth position -> pattern: S _ A _ T
   Similarly, second and fourth positions to fill.

 We also want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Since we have limited guesses, we can try to cover multiple possibilities.

 However, note that we have only 4 guesses left (since we've used 2). We need to be efficient.

 Let's list possible words:

 For case 1: S _ A T _
   The second letter: can be B, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but must form a word)
   The fifth letter: similarly.

 Example words:
   ""swath"" -> S,W,A,T,H -> second letter W, fifth H -> avoids excluded? Yes. But we haven't tested W and H.
   ""scats"" -> but C excluded? Yes, avoid.
   ""seats"" -> E excluded? Avoid.
   ""slats"" -> L? and then T and S? But S is already at first? And T at fourth? But ""slats"" has two S? and two T? Also, L is new. But we have to avoid duplicates? Not necessarily, but we don't know if the word has duplicates. However, we are trying to get information.

   But note: we already know S is at first and A at third, and T at fourth? Then the word would be S L A T S? That's ""slats"", which is a word? But we have two S? and we know S is at first, so the last S would be a duplicate? But we don't know if duplicate S is allowed? Actually, the feedback for ""staid"" had S at first and it was correct, but that doesn't tell us about duplicates? However, we are guessing.

   But we have to avoid excluded letters: ""slats"" has S, L, A, T, S -> letters: S, L, A, T. We know A and T are in the word? But we don't know about L? And we haven't excluded L? So it's okay? But we are using S twice? We might get less information? Because if we get a duplicate S, we don't know if it's in the word twice? But we are trying to solve.

   Alternatively, we can avoid duplicates? Let's try to find without duplicates.

   ""swath"": S, W, A, T, H -> all distinct? Yes. And avoids excluded? Yes.

   ""splat"": S, P, L, A, T -> but T is at fifth? In ""splat"": S(1), P(2), L(3), A(4), T(5) -> but we need A at third? So no, in this word A is at fourth? So not matching pattern.

   For pattern S _ A T _:
     ""swath"": S(1), W(2), A(3), T(4), H(5) -> perfect.

   ""shaft"": S(1), H(2), A(3), F(4), T(5) -> but then T is at fifth? Wait, no: fourth is F? So T is at fifth? Then that would be case 2? 

   So for case 1 (T at fourth): 
        ""swath"" is one.

   ""scatt"" -> not a word? and C excluded.

   ""skate"": S(1), K(2), A(3), T(4), E(5) -> but E is excluded? Avoid.

   ""slate"": S(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5) -> E excluded? Avoid.

   ""sooty"": S(1), O(2), O(3) -> but we need A at third? So no.

   ""spats"": S(1), P(2), A(3), T(4), S(5) -> duplicate S? But we can use? But we are testing? And P is new.

   But we have ""swath"" as a candidate.

 Case 2: T at fifth: pattern S _ A _ T
   Then the second and fourth positions to fill.

   Example:
     ""soapt"": not a word? 
     ""saint"": S(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> but we need A at third? And I and N are excluded? Avoid.
     ""sault"": S(1), A(2), U(3), L(4), T(5) -> but A is at second? Not third.
     ""salty"": S(1), A(2), L(3), T(4), Y(5) -> but A at second? Not third.

   We need A at third? So the pattern is S _ A _ T -> so second letter is ?, third A, fourth ?, fifth T.

   ""seat"" -> too short.

   ""sabot"": S(1), A(2), B(3), O(4), T(5) -> A at second? Not third.

   How about ""scant"": S(1), C(2), A(3), N(4), T(5) -> but C and N excluded? Avoid.

   ""shaft"": S(1), H(2), A(3), F(4), T(5) -> but T is at fifth? So pattern: S H A F T -> which is ""shaft"". And avoids excluded? Letters: S, H, A, F, T -> no C,R,N,E,I,D? Yes. So ""shaft"" is a candidate? But wait, in ""shaft"", T is at fifth? So it fits case 2? But we also have case 1 candidate ""swath"".

   However, note: in ""shaft"", the T is at fifth? But we have a candidate for case 1: ""swath"" (T at fourth) and case 2: ""shaft"" (T at fifth). But we don't know which one? We need to choose a guess that can help us distinguish.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests both possibilities? But we have to fix the pattern.

   But note: we know T is in the word and not in second position? So it must be in fourth or fifth? We can try to cover both? But we have to choose one word.

   However, we can choose a word that has T in a position we haven't tested? But we only have positions 4 and 5 left? And we know it's not in 2? So it must be in 4 or 5? So we can try to guess a word that has T in one of these? But we don't know which? So we have to pick one? Or we can pick a word that doesn't have T in the second position? But we already know T is in the word? So we don't need to test T again? We just need to find its position.

   But we have two candidates: ""swath"" (T in fourth) and ""shaft"" (T in fifth). They are different.

   How about we choose a word that has T in the fourth position? Then if it's correct, we get T in fourth? Or if not, then T must be in fifth? But we have only one guess to test? Actually, we have 4 guesses left? But we are making the third guess.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses more new letters? And that might help us narrow down.

   Let me see: we have to fill the second position and either the fourth or fifth? But we don't know which? So we can try to use a word that has T in the fourth? Then if we get T in the correct position? Then we know? Or if we get T in the wrong position? Then it must be in fifth? But we already know T is in the word? So if we put T in fourth and it's correct? Then we get a check? If we put T in fourth and it's not correct? Then we get a minus? But we already have a minus for T in second? So if we put T in fourth and it's not correct, then we get a minus? Then we know T must be in fifth? So that's one way.

   But we can also choose a word that doesn't have T? But we know T is in the word? So we must include T? Because we are trying to find its position? And we have to use the known letters? Actually, we are not forced? But if we don't include T, then we might not get information about T's position? And we have to guess the entire word? So it's better to include T? Because we know it's in the word? So we can try to place it.

   So let's try ""swath"": 
        Pattern: S _ A T _ -> we are putting T in fourth? 
        If we get feedback: 
          If T is actually in fourth? Then we get T(✓) for fourth? 
          If T is in fifth? Then we get T(-) for fourth? because it's in the word but wrong position? Then we know it must be in fifth? 

   Also, we get information about the other letters: W and H? 

   Similarly, if we choose ""shaft"": 
        Pattern: S _ A _ T -> T in fifth?
        Then if T is in fifth? we get T(✓) for fifth? 
        If T is in fourth? we get T(-) for fifth? but wait, if T is in fourth and we put it in fifth? then we get a minus? and we know it's in fourth? 

   So both are good? But we have to choose one.

   Also, we have to consider that the second letter is unknown? In ""swath"", we are using W in second? In ""shaft"", we are using H in second? 

   We can also consider other words? 

   For case 1 (T in fourth): 
        Other words: 
          ""swath"" (as above)
          ""swats"" -> S,W,A,T,S -> duplicate S? But we know S is at first? So if the word has two S? But we don't know? And we are testing? But we get less information? 
          ""spats"" -> S,P,A,T,S -> duplicate S? 
          ""skate"" -> but E excluded? 
          ""slate"" -> E excluded? 
          ""smalt"" -> S,M,A,L,T -> distinct? Yes. And avoids excluded? M and L are new? So ""smalt"" is a word? It means a type of glass? 

   For case 2 (T in fifth): 
        ""shaft"" (as above)
        ""scatt"" -> not a word? 
        ""splat"" -> but T is at fifth? and A at fourth? So not? 
        ""sweat"" -> S,W,E,A,T -> but E excluded? 
        ""sight"" -> S,I,G,H,T -> but I excluded? 
        ""sought"" -> too long? 
        ""sault"" -> but A at second? 
        ""softa"" -> S,O,F,T,A -> but A at fifth? and T at fourth? So not? 

   Another: ""shalt"" -> S,H,A,L,T -> but T is at fifth? So pattern: S H A L T -> which is ""shalt"". And avoids excluded? Letters: S,H,A,L,T -> no C,R,N,E,I,D? Yes. So ""shalt"" is a candidate for case 2? 

   But in ""shalt"": 
        S(1), H(2), A(3), L(4), T(5) -> so T is at fifth? 

   So we have:
        Case 1: ""swath"", ""smalt""
        Case 2: ""shaft"", ""shalt""

   We can choose one that uses more common letters? Or that tests more new letters? 

   We have to test the second letter? And also the last letter? 

   Let's compare:
        ""swath"": tests W and H? 
        ""smalt"": tests M and L? 
        ""shaft"": tests H and F? 
        ""shalt"": tests H and L? 

   We have two candidates with H? 

   Also, note that in ""shaft"" and ""shalt"", we are using H in the second position? So if we get feedback that H is in the word? Then we know? 

   But we don't know if H is in the word? 

   Similarly, for W, M, L, F? 

   We want to maximize information? 

   How about we choose a word that has letters that are common? 

   Common consonants: T, S, L, D, N, M, ... but D and N excluded? So L, M, H, F, etc.

   Let's choose ""swath"" because it uses two new letters (W and H) and we get to test T in fourth? 

   Or ""shaft"" because it uses H and F? 

   But we have to decide? 

   Alternatively, we can avoid using H in two different positions? 

   Since we don't have much information about the second letter, we can try a word that uses a vowel in the second position? Because we have only one vowel so far (A)? And we excluded E and I? So remaining vowels: O, U, and sometimes Y? 

   For case 1: S _ A T _ 
        We can try: ""sooty"" -> but third letter O? Not A? 
        ""south"" -> S,O,U,T,H -> but third letter U? Not A? 
        ""sowth"" -> not a word? 

   For case 2: S _ A _ T
        ""south"" -> S,O,U,T,H -> but T is at fourth? and H at fifth? So pattern: S O A U T? -> no, because we need A at third? So ""south"" is S(1),O(2),U(3),T(4),H(5) -> third is U? Not A? 

   ""soapy"" -> S,O,A,P,Y -> but then T is not included? We must include T? Because we know T is in the word? 

   So we have to include T? 

   Therefore, we go back to the candidates: ""swath"", ""smalt"", ""shaft"", ""shalt"".

   I think ""swath"" is a good choice? Because it uses common letters? 

   But let's check frequency: 
        W is less common? 
        H is common? 

   Alternatively, ""shaft"" is a common word? 

   How about ""shalt""? It's a word? 

   We can choose ""shaft"" because it's a common word? 

   But note: in ""shaft"", we are putting T at fifth? And we don't know if T is at fourth or fifth? 

   We can also consider: we have to avoid the excluded letters? 

   Let me choose ""shaft"" as the guess? 

   But wait: in ""shaft"", the second letter is H? And we don't know if H is in the word? 

   Similarly, in ""swath"", second letter is W? 

   We can also consider: we have the letter T to place? 

   Since we have two cases, we can choose a word that doesn't commit to one? But we have to? 

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has T in a position that is not second? But we don't know? 

   I think we have to choose one? 

   Let's go with ""shaft"" because it's a common word? 

   But note: if we choose ""shaft"", and if T is actually in fourth? Then we will get T in fifth as a minus? And then we know T is in fourth? 

   Similarly, if we choose ""swath"", and if T is in fifth? Then we get T in fourth as a minus? 

   So both are acceptable? 

   But we also get information about the other letters? 

   I'll choose ""shaft"" because it uses H and F? which are common? 

   So guess: ""shaft""

   But let's write it: S H A F T

   However, we must check: 
        First letter S: we know it's correct? So we expect a check? 
        Second letter H: we don't know? 
        Third letter A: correct? 
        Fourth letter F: we don't know? 
        Fifth letter T: we don't know? 

   We might get feedback that tells us about H, F, and T? 

   But we know T is in the word? So if we put T at fifth and it's not there? Then we get a minus? Meaning T is in the word but not at fifth? Then it must be at fourth? 

   So we can deduce? 

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has T in a position that we haven't tried? But we only have positions 4 and 5? 

   So I think it's okay? 

   But wait: what if the word has two T's? Then we might have T in both fourth and fifth? But we don't know? But that's rare? 

   We'll go with ""shaft"".

   However, let me see if there's a word that tests more letters? 

   Another candidate: ""swath"" tests W and H? 

   But we have to choose? 

   I'll go with ""shaft"".

   But note: we have excluded I and D? And we are using F? 

   So guess: ""shaft""

<guess>shaft</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

1. **First Guess: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)**  
   - **A** is in the word and **correctly placed at position 3**.  
   - **C, R, N, E** are **not** in the word.  

2. **Second Guess: ""staid"" → Feedback: S(✓) T(-) A(✓) I(x) D(x)**  
   - **S** is in the word and **correctly placed at position 1**.  
   - **T** is in the word but **wrong position** (cannot be at position 2).  
   - **A** is **confirmed at position 3** (redundant but consistent).  
   - **I** and **D** are **not** in the word.  

### Key Insights:
- **Secret word pattern**: `S _ A _ _` (S at start, A at position 3).  
- **Confirmed letters in word**: **S, A, T** (T is present but not at position 2).  
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, N, E, I, D.  
- **T's position**: Must be at **position 4 or 5** (since it can't be at 2).  
- **Available letters**: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

### Strategy for Third Guess:
- Prioritize words fitting `S _ A _ _` with **T in position 4 or 5**.  
- Test new high-frequency consonants (e.g., **H, F, L, M**) to maximize information.  
- Avoid excluded letters and reuse known letters (S, A, T) strategically.  
- **Optimal candidate**: **""shaft""** (S H A F T).  
  - Tests **T at position 5** (if wrong, T must be at position 4).  
  - Tests new letters **H** (position 2) and **F** (position 4).  
  - Uses distinct letters to cover more ground.

Avoid.\n   ""train"" -> T,R,A,I,N -> but R and N excluded? Avoid.\n   ""plaid"" -> P,L,A,I,D -> avoids excluded letters? R not in excluded? R is excluded? Feedback: R(x) -> so R is excluded, but P,L,A,I,D: no C,R,N,E? Yes, avoids them.\n\n So ""plaid"" is a candidate: P, L, A, I, D.\n\n But note: the word does not have R, so that\'s okay.\n\n Another candidate: ""flail"" -> F,L,A,I,L -> duplicate L? And L appears twice. Not ideal.\n\n How about ""soapy"" -> S,O,A,P,Y -> O is a vowel, but pattern: S(1),O(2),A(3) -> yes? Then P(4), Y(5). Avoids excluded letters.\n\n Another: ""whack"" -> W,H,A,C,K -> but C is excluded? Yes, C is excluded (from feedback: C(x)). So no.\n\n Another: ""thank"" -> T,H,A,N,K -> includes N and H? N is excluded.\n\n Let\'s list: \n   We need a word: _ _ A _ _ \n   with letters that are not in [C, R, N, E]\n\n Some words:\n   ""valid"" -> V,A,L,I,D -> but A is second? V(1),A(2),L(3) -> not A at third.\n   ""faint"" -> F,A,I,N,T -> excludes? N is excluded -> no.\n\n Another one: ""salad"" -> S,A,L,A,D -> has A at second and fourth? S(1),A(2),L(3),A(4),D(5) -> so third letter L? No, third is L.\n\n We need third letter A: so the word is like: first letter ?, second letter ?, third letter A, fourth letter ?, fifth letter ?.\n\n So pattern: [letter1][letter2]A[letter4][letter5]\n\n And letter1, letter2, letter4, letter5 cannot be C, R, N, E, and also not A? Wait, A is already known, but can it appear again? The feedback for A was only one and correct. But that doesn\'t mean there can\'t be another A? However, we don\'t have information. So it might appear again? But we don\'t want to assume duplicates.\n\n For maximum information, we guess new letters and avoid duplicates if possible.\n\n So let\'s try a word with distinct letters that we haven\'t tried yet, and avoid excluded ones.\n\n Possible letters: we\'ve used C,R,A,N,E so exclude those. Then new letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\n We need five distinct letters and A at position 3.\n\n Let me try: \n   Letter1: T (high frequency)\n   Letter2: O (high frequency vowel)\n   Then A at position 3.\n   Letter4: P (common consonant)\n   Letter5: S (common letter)\n\n So word: T O A P S -> ""topas""? That\'s not a word? Maybe ""tapis""? But that means tapestry? Not common.\n\n Alternatively: ""toast"" -> T,O,A,S,T -> duplicate T? And S? But we have T twice? Also, we have A at third? T(1),O(2),A(3),S(4),T(5) -> duplicate T? And checks: T,O,A,S,T -> avoids C,R,N,E? Yes? But duplicate T? Since it\'s valid word? Yes, ""toast"" is a valid word.\n\n However, feedback for duplicates: but we don\'t know if secret word has duplicate. So it\'s okay to guess duplicates? But if we avoid, we might get more information.\n\n Alternatively: ""pilot"" -> P,I,L,O,T -> but third letter L? Not A.\n\n How about ""koala"" -> K,O,A,L,A -> third letter A? Yes: K,O,A,L,A -> but duplicates A? And avoids excluded? Yes, letters: K,O,A,L,A -> excludes C,R,N,E? Yes. But duplicate A? We are not sure.\n\n Alternatively: ""modal"" -> M,O,D,A,L -> again A at fourth? M,O,D,A,L: positions: 1:M,2:O,3:D,4:A,5:L -> not at third.\n\n We need the third letter to be A.\n\n How about ""sofas"" -> S,O,F,A,S -> third letter F? Not A.\n\n Another: ""cabal""? But C is excluded.\n\n One that comes to mind: ""AWAIT"" -> A,W,A,I,T -> first letter A? And third letter A? But we don\'t know if A is at first? Anyway, pattern: 1:A, 2:W, 3:A, 4:I, 5:T -> but third is A? Yes. But we have A at first as well? And we haven\'t tested A in first position? Actually, we know from first guess that A is at third? But that doesn\'t mean A cannot be elsewhere. However, we want to test new positions? Also, we haven\'t used W, I, T.\n\n But we know the word has A at third? We don\'t know about other As? So it\'s okay.\n\n However, ""await"" uses two A\'s? Also, first letter A? We don\'t know if it\'s in the word elsewhere? But it might be, and we already have the third letter, so we could use a word without duplicates? Let\'s try to find without duplicates.\n\n How about ""basal""? B,A,S,A,L -> duplicates A? Not ideal.\n\n Another: ""fatal"" -> F,A,T,A,L -> duplicates.\n\n Perhaps it\'s hard? Let me try ""koala""? But duplicates? Or ""oasis"" -> third letter A? O(1),A(2),S(3) -> no.\n\n What about ""habit""? H,A,B,I,T -> third letter B? Not A.\n\n ""panic"" -> P,A,N,I,C -> but N and C excluded? No.\n\n Another word: ""patio"" -> P,A,T,I,O -> third letter T? Not A.\n\n I found: ""manor"" -> M,A,N,O,R -> but R and N excluded? R(x) and N(x) -> avoid.\n\n ""papas"" -> duplicates P and A? and third letter P? Not A.\n\n ""salad"" -> S,A,L,A,D -> duplicate A? and third letter L? Not A.\n\n Wait, I think I recall: ""staid"" -> S,T,A,I,D -> third letter A? Yes: S(1),T(2),A(3),I(4),D(5). And avoids excluded letters? Excluded: C,R,N,E -> letters in ""staid"": S,T,A,I,D -> none of these are in the excluded list.\n\n So ""staid"" is a valid word? And S,T,I,D are new.\n\n Also, we don\'t have duplicates? So we guess ""staid""?\n\n Sometimes ""staid"" is used.\n\n Alternatively: ""plain"" -> P,L,A,I,N -> includes N? Excluded? N is excluded? Yes, from feedback -> avoid.\n\n Another: ""quail"" -> Q,U,A,I,L -> third letter A? Yes. Letters: Q,U,A,I,L -> avoids C,R,N,E? Yes. And distinct? Yes.\n\n But Q is less common? Maybe not.\n\n How about ""spail""? Not word? Valid?\n\n Instead, let me search for a word that ends with ""aky"": ""janky""? Not.\n\n Another: ""baked"" -> B,A,K,E,D -> E excluded? Avoid.\n\n So ""staid"" seems acceptable.\n\n But note: we have A at third? Yes. And letters S,T,I,D are not excluded? Correct.\n\n Therefore, a good guess is ""staid"".\n\n But let\'s double-check: S(1), T(2), A(3), I(4), D(5). Yes.\n\n And excludes: C,R,N,E? Yes.\n\n So I will guess ""staid"".\n\n However, wait: in the first guess ""crane"", we had R and that was at position 2? And we were told R is not in the word. So R is excluded? Yes. Also N and E are excluded.\n\n So ""staid"" has D? We haven\'t tested D? And S,T? Yes.\n\n This might be a good choice.\n\n Alternatively, if we want more vowels? We have I as a vowel? Also, we can try ""oasis"" but can\'t because third letter is S.\n\n How about ""adios""? A(1),D(2),I(3),O(4),S(5) -> third letter I? Not A.\n\n Another word: ""stair"" -> S,T,A,I,R -> includes R? Excluded? R is excluded? Yes, avoid.\n\n So ""staid"" is acceptable.\n\n Therefore, second guess: ""staid""\n\n<guess>staid</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **Feedback**: C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(x)\n- **Key insights**:\n  - The third letter of the secret word is **A**.\n  - Letters **C, R, N,** and **E** are **not** in the secret word.\n- **New guess strategy**:\n  - Focus on words with **A in the third position** (pattern: `_ _ A _ _`).\n  - Avoid reused letters (C, R, N, E) and use new, common letters to maximize information.\n  - Prioritize distinct letters over duplicates to test more possibilities.\n  - Valid candidates: ""staid"" (S, T, A, I, D), which fits the pattern, uses unused common letters, and avoids excluded characters.\n\nThis guess will help test new consonants (S, T, D) and the vowel (I).\n\n<guess>staid</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: staid -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(-) A(✓) I(x) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from the second guess ""staid"":\n - S: ✓ (correct position, so first letter is S)\n - T: - (in the word but wrong position)\n - A: ✓ (correct position, third letter is A, which we already knew)\n - I: x (not in the word)\n - D: x (not in the word)\n\n So now we know:\n   The secret word starts with S and has A as the third letter: S _ A _ _\n   The letter T is in the word, but not in the second position (since we got a \'-\' for T in position 2).\n   Letters I and D are not in the word.\n\n Also, from the first guess, we know that C, R, N, E are not in the word.\n\n So total excluded letters: C, R, N, E, I, D.\n\n We have to use the fact that T is in the word but not in the second position. So T must be in the fourth or fifth position.\n\n Pattern: S _ A _ _\n\n And the word contains T (in position 4 or 5) and does not contain: C, R, N, E, I, D.\n\n We also have the letters we haven\'t tried: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n We need to form a word that fits: S _ A T _  or S _ A _ T\n\n But note: the second position is open and must be filled with a letter that is not excluded and not T (because T is not in second position). Also, the last position (if T is in fourth, then fifth is open; if T in fifth, then fourth is open).\n\n Let\'s consider the two cases:\n\n Case 1: T is in the fourth position -> pattern: S _ A T _\n   Then the second letter must be one of the available letters (not excluded and not T) and the fifth letter must be one of the available letters.\n\n Case 2: T is in the fifth position -> pattern: S _ A _ T\n   Similarly, second and fourth positions to fill.\n\n We also want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\n Since we have limited guesses, we can try to cover multiple possibilities.\n\n However, note that we have only 4 guesses left (since we\'ve used 2). We need to be efficient.\n\n Let\'s list possible words:\n\n For case 1: S _ A T _\n   The second letter: can be B, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but must form a word)\n   The fifth letter: similarly.\n\n Example words:\n   ""swath"" -> S,W,A,T,H -> second letter W, fifth H -> avoids excluded? Yes. But we haven\'t tested W and H.\n   ""scats"" -> but C excluded? Yes, avoid.\n   ""seats"" -> E excluded? Avoid.\n   ""slats"" -> L? and then T and S? But S is already at first? And T at fourth? But ""slats"" has two S? and two T? Also, L is new. But we have to avoid duplicates? Not necessarily, but we don\'t know if the word has duplicates. However, we are trying to get information.\n\n   But note: we already know S is at first and A at third, and T at fourth? Then the word would be S L A T S? That\'s ""slats"", which is a word? But we have two S? and we know S is at first, so the last S would be a duplicate? But we don\'t know if duplicate S is allowed? Actually, the feedback for ""staid"" had S at first and it was correct, but that doesn\'t tell us about duplicates? However, we are guessing.\n\n   But we have to avoid excluded letters: ""slats"" has S, L, A, T, S -> letters: S, L, A, T. We know A and T are in the word? But we don\'t know about L? And we haven\'t excluded L? So it\'s okay? But we are using S twice? We might get less information? Because if we get a duplicate S, we don\'t know if it\'s in the word twice? But we are trying to solve.\n\n   Alternatively, we can avoid duplicates? Let\'s try to find without duplicates.\n\n   ""swath"": S, W, A, T, H -> all distinct? Yes. And avoids excluded? Yes.\n\n   ""splat"": S, P, L, A, T -> but T is at fifth? In ""splat"": S(1), P(2), L(3), A(4), T(5) -> but we need A at third? So no, in this word A is at fourth? So not matching pattern.\n\n   For pattern S _ A T _:\n     ""swath"": S(1), W(2), A(3), T(4), H(5) -> perfect.\n\n   ""shaft"": S(1), H(2), A(3), F(4), T(5) -> but then T is at fifth? Wait, no: fourth is F? So T is at fifth? Then that would be case 2? \n\n   So for case 1 (T at fourth): \n        ""swath"" is one.\n\n   ""scatt"" -> not a word? and C excluded.\n\n   ""skate"": S(1), K(2), A(3), T(4), E(5) -> but E is excluded? Avoid.\n\n   ""slate"": S(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5) -> E excluded? Avoid.\n\n   ""sooty"": S(1), O(2), O(3) -> but we need A at third? So no.\n\n   ""spats"": S(1), P(2), A(3), T(4), S(5) -> duplicate S? But we can use? But we are testing? And P is new.\n\n   But we have ""swath"" as a candidate.\n\n Case 2: T at fifth: pattern S _ A _ T\n   Then the second and fourth positions to fill.\n\n   Example:\n     ""soapt"": not a word? \n     ""saint"": S(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> but we need A at third? And I and N are excluded? Avoid.\n     ""sault"": S(1), A(2), U(3), L(4), T(5) -> but A is at second? Not third.\n     ""salty"": S(1), A(2), L(3), T(4), Y(5) -> but A at second? Not third.\n\n   We need A at third? So the pattern is S _ A _ T -> so second letter is ?, third A, fourth ?, fifth T.\n\n   ""seat"" -> too short.\n\n   ""sabot"": S(1), A(2), B(3), O(4), T(5) -> A at second? Not third.\n\n   How about ""scant"": S(1), C(2), A(3), N(4), T(5) -> but C and N excluded? Avoid.\n\n   ""shaft"": S(1), H(2), A(3), F(4), T(5) -> but T is at fifth? So pattern: S H A F T -> which is ""shaft"". And avoids excluded? Letters: S, H, A, F, T -> no C,R,N,E,I,D? Yes. So ""shaft"" is a candidate? But wait, in ""shaft"", T is at fifth? So it fits case 2? But we also have case 1 candidate ""swath"".\n\n   However, note: in ""shaft"", the T is at fifth? But we have a candidate for case 1: ""swath"" (T at fourth) and case 2: ""shaft"" (T at fifth). But we don\'t know which one? We need to choose a guess that can help us distinguish.\n\n   Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests both possibilities? But we have to fix the pattern.\n\n   But note: we know T is in the word and not in second position? So it must be in fourth or fifth? We can try to cover both? But we have to choose one word.\n\n   However, we can choose a word that has T in a position we haven\'t tested? But we only have positions 4 and 5 left? And we know it\'s not in 2? So it must be in 4 or 5? So we can try to guess a word that has T in one of these? But we don\'t know which? So we have to pick one? Or we can pick a word that doesn\'t have T in the second position? But we already know T is in the word? So we don\'t need to test T again? We just need to find its position.\n\n   But we have two candidates: ""swath"" (T in fourth) and ""shaft"" (T in fifth). They are different.\n\n   How about we choose a word that has T in the fourth position? Then if it\'s correct, we get T in fourth? Or if not, then T must be in fifth? But we have only one guess to test? Actually, we have 4 guesses left? But we are making the third guess.\n\n   Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses more new letters? And that might help us narrow down.\n\n   Let me see: we have to fill the second position and either the fourth or fifth? But we don\'t know which? So we can try to use a word that has T in the fourth? Then if we get T in the correct position? Then we know? Or if we get T in the wrong position? Then it must be in fifth? But we already know T is in the word? So if we put T in fourth and it\'s correct? Then we get a check? If we put T in fourth and it\'s not correct? Then we get a minus? But we already have a minus for T in second? So if we put T in fourth and it\'s not correct, then we get a minus? Then we know T must be in fifth? So that\'s one way.\n\n   But we can also choose a word that doesn\'t have T? But we know T is in the word? So we must include T? Because we are trying to find its position? And we have to use the known letters? Actually, we are not forced? But if we don\'t include T, then we might not get information about T\'s position? And we have to guess the entire word? So it\'s better to include T? Because we know it\'s in the word? So we can try to place it.\n\n   So let\'s try ""swath"": \n        Pattern: S _ A T _ -> we are putting T in fourth? \n        If we get feedback: \n          If T is actually in fourth? Then we get T(✓) for fourth? \n          If T is in fifth? Then we get T(-) for fourth? because it\'s in the word but wrong position? Then we know it must be in fifth? \n\n   Also, we get information about the other letters: W and H? \n\n   Similarly, if we choose ""shaft"": \n        Pattern: S _ A _ T -> T in fifth?\n        Then if T is in fifth? we get T(✓) for fifth? \n        If T is in fourth? we get T(-) for fifth? but wait, if T is in fourth and we put it in fifth? then we get a minus? and we know it\'s in fourth? \n\n   So both are good? But we have to choose one.\n\n   Also, we have to consider that the second letter is unknown? In ""swath"", we are using W in second? In ""shaft"", we are using H in second? \n\n   We can also consider other words? \n\n   For case 1 (T in fourth): \n        Other words: \n          ""swath"" (as above)\n          ""swats"" -> S,W,A,T,S -> duplicate S? But we know S is at first? So if the word has two S? But we don\'t know? And we are testing? But we get less information? \n          ""spats"" -> S,P,A,T,S -> duplicate S? \n          ""skate"" -> but E excluded? \n          ""slate"" -> E excluded? \n          ""smalt"" -> S,M,A,L,T -> distinct? Yes. And avoids excluded? M and L are new? So ""smalt"" is a word? It means a type of glass? \n\n   For case 2 (T in fifth): \n        ""shaft"" (as above)\n        ""scatt"" -> not a word? \n        ""splat"" -> but T is at fifth? and A at fourth? So not? \n        ""sweat"" -> S,W,E,A,T -> but E excluded? \n        ""sight"" -> S,I,G,H,T -> but I excluded? \n        ""sought"" -> too long? \n        ""sault"" -> but A at second? \n        ""softa"" -> S,O,F,T,A -> but A at fifth? and T at fourth? So not? \n\n   Another: ""shalt"" -> S,H,A,L,T -> but T is at fifth? So pattern: S H A L T -> which is ""shalt"". And avoids excluded? Letters: S,H,A,L,T -> no C,R,N,E,I,D? Yes. So ""shalt"" is a candidate for case 2? \n\n   But in ""shalt"": \n        S(1), H(2), A(3), L(4), T(5) -> so T is at fifth? \n\n   So we have:\n        Case 1: ""swath"", ""smalt""\n        Case 2: ""shaft"", ""shalt""\n\n   We can choose one that uses more common letters? Or that tests more new letters? \n\n   We have to test the second letter? And also the last letter? \n\n   Let\'s compare:\n        ""swath"": tests W and H? \n        ""smalt"": tests M and L? \n        ""shaft"": tests H and F? \n        ""shalt"": tests H and L? \n\n   We have two candidates with H? \n\n   Also, note that in ""shaft"" and ""shalt"", we are using H in the second position? So if we get feedback that H is in the word? Then we know? \n\n   But we don\'t know if H is in the word? \n\n   Similarly, for W, M, L, F? \n\n   We want to maximize information? \n\n   How about we choose a word that has letters that are common? \n\n   Common consonants: T, S, L, D, N, M, ... but D and N excluded? So L, M, H, F, etc.\n\n   Let\'s choose ""swath"" because it uses two new letters (W and H) and we get to test T in fourth? \n\n   Or ""shaft"" because it uses H and F? \n\n   But we have to decide? \n\n   Alternatively, we can avoid using H in two different positions? \n\n   Since we don\'t have much information about the second letter, we can try a word that uses a vowel in the second position? Because we have only one vowel so far (A)? And we excluded E and I? So remaining vowels: O, U, and sometimes Y? \n\n   For case 1: S _ A T _ \n        We can try: ""sooty"" -> but third letter O? Not A? \n        ""south"" -> S,O,U,T,H -> but third letter U? Not A? \n        ""sowth"" -> not a word? \n\n   For case 2: S _ A _ T\n        ""south"" -> S,O,U,T,H -> but T is at fourth? and H at fifth? So pattern: S O A U T? -> no, because we need A at third? So ""south"" is S(1),O(2),U(3),T(4),H(5) -> third is U? Not A? \n\n   ""soapy"" -> S,O,A,P,Y -> but then T is not included? We must include T? Because we know T is in the word? \n\n   So we have to include T? \n\n   Therefore, we go back to the candidates: ""swath"", ""smalt"", ""shaft"", ""shalt"".\n\n   I think ""swath"" is a good choice? Because it uses common letters? \n\n   But let\'s check frequency: \n        W is less common? \n        H is common? \n\n   Alternatively, ""shaft"" is a common word? \n\n   How about ""shalt""? It\'s a word? \n\n   We can choose ""shaft"" because it\'s a common word? \n\n   But note: in ""shaft"", we are putting T at fifth? And we don\'t know if T is at fourth or fifth? \n\n   We can also consider: we have to avoid the excluded letters? \n\n   Let me choose ""shaft"" as the guess? \n\n   But wait: in ""shaft"", the second letter is H? And we don\'t know if H is in the word? \n\n   Similarly, in ""swath"", second letter is W? \n\n   We can also consider: we have the letter T to place? \n\n   Since we have two cases, we can choose a word that doesn\'t commit to one? But we have to? \n\n   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has T in a position that is not second? But we don\'t know? \n\n   I think we have to choose one? \n\n   Let\'s go with ""shaft"" because it\'s a common word? \n\n   But note: if we choose ""shaft"", and if T is actually in fourth? Then we will get T in fifth as a minus? And then we know T is in fourth? \n\n   Similarly, if we choose ""swath"", and if T is in fifth? Then we get T in fourth as a minus? \n\n   So both are acceptable? \n\n   But we also get information about the other letters? \n\n   I\'ll choose ""shaft"" because it uses H and F? which are common? \n\n   So guess: ""shaft""\n\n   But let\'s write it: S H A F T\n\n   However, we must check: \n        First letter S: we know it\'s correct? So we expect a check? \n        Second letter H: we don\'t know? \n        Third letter A: correct? \n        Fourth letter F: we don\'t know? \n        Fifth letter T: we don\'t know? \n\n   We might get feedback that tells us about H, F, and T? \n\n   But we know T is in the word? So if we put T at fifth and it\'s not there? Then we get a minus? Meaning T is in the word but not at fifth? Then it must be at fourth? \n\n   So we can deduce? \n\n   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has T in a position that we haven\'t tried?

We have the feedback from Guess 3: ""shaft"" -> S(✓) H(✓) A(✓) F(x) T(✓)
 This means:
   S is correct at position 1 -> confirmed (we already knew S at 1 from Guess 2)
   H is correct at position 2 -> so the second letter is H? Previously we didn't know that? 
   A is correct at position 3 -> confirmed
   F is not in the word -> so F is excluded
   T is correct at position 5? Wait, in ""shaft"", T is at position 5? And it got a check? So T is at position 5? 

 So now we know the secret word is: S H A _ T

 Why? Because:
   Position 1: S
   Position 2: H
   Position 3: A
   Position 4: missing? We have to fill
   Position 5: T

 And we know F is excluded? So no F.

 Also, recall previous exclusions: from Guess1: C, R, N, E excluded; from Guess2: I, D excluded; and now F excluded.

 So total excluded: C, R, N, E, I, D, F.

 The only letter missing is the fourth letter? And it must be a letter that hasn't been excluded? 

 We also know the letter must be from the remaining available letters? 

 Available letters: B, G, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly others not used?).

 We must pick one? But wait, we have only one position to fill? And we have 6 tries? We can guess? 

 But note: we have to form a valid 5-letter word: S H A _ T.

 So we need to find a letter that fits in the fourth position to form a word? 

 What words have the pattern S H A _ T?

 Common words: 
   ""shalt"" -> S H A L T -> L at fourth? But ""shalt"" is a word? 
   ""shant"" -> not standard? 
   ""shart"" -> vulgar? not ideal? 
   ""shaft"" we already guessed? 

 Valid English words: 
   ""shalt"": meaning ""shall"" in archaic English? 
   ""shant"": not common? 
   ""shakt"": not common? 
   ""shast"": not? 

 How about ""shale""? But it ends with E? We need T at the end? 

 Alternatively, ""sharp""? But ends with P? Not T? 

 Actually, we need the word to end with T and be S H A _ T.

 So possible words: 
   ""shalt"" as above? 
   ""shart"" is slang? 
   ""shaft"" we guessed? But we guessed ""shaft"" and found F is not in the word? So we know it's not ""shaft""? 

 What other possibilities? 

 Also, ""shakt""? Not common? 

 Another: ""shant"" -> it might be a variant? 

 But let's look for common words? 

 Perhaps I missed? 

 How about ""shaot""? No? 

 Another: ""shaht""? No? 

 We might have to consider ""shalt"" as the only reasonable option? 

 But note: we excluded F? So if we try ""shalt"", we are using L? 

 But L is not excluded? So we can try? 

 But wait, we don't know if L is in the word? 

 Since we have only one letter missing? And we have several possibilities? But we have to guess? And we have 3 guesses left? 

 However, we can list possible letters? For the fourth letter? 

 The letter must be such that S H A letter T forms a valid English word? 

 Known valid words:
   ""shalt"": used in old English? 
   ""shant"": abbreviation for ""shall not"" or a variant? 
   ""shaht""? Not a word? 

 Also, ""shart"" is a word? But informal? 

 Can we consider other words? 

 Another: ""sheat"" -> but not S H A? It would be S H E A T? 

 No? 

 How about ""shalt"" remains the best option? 

 But let's check the feedback? In the second guess ""staid"", we had T at position 2? And it was a minus? Meaning T is in the word but not at position 2? Now we found T at position 5? So that's consistent? 

 Also, we are not forbidden to reuse letters? But we don't have to? 

 How about ""shalm""? But not ends with T? 

 I think ""shalt"" is a valid guess? 

 But note: we haven't tried L? And L might be the missing letter? 

 Alternatively, we can try ""shakt"" or others? But they aren't valid? 

 So let's try ""shalt"".

 But wait: in the third guess we guessed ""shaft"" and got:
   S(✓) H(✓) A(✓) F(x) T(✓)
   This means: 
      S correct (1), H correct (2), A correct (3), F not in word, T correct? But wait: in ""shaft"", T is the fifth letter? So if we got a check for T? That means T is at position 5? So the word ends with T? 

 Therefore, the only missing letter is the fourth? 

 And we need a letter that, when placed in the fourth, forms a word? 

 Words: 
   ""shalt"" -> S H A L T
   ""shant"" -> S H A N T -> but N is excluded? From first guess? N(x). So cannot be.
   ""shart"" -> S H A R T -> R excluded? From first guess? R(x). So no.
   ""shaft"" -> already tried? and F excluded? 

 So the only common word left? is ""shalt""? 

 Therefore, we must guess ""shalt""? 

 But is there any other? 

 How about ""shatt""? Not a word? 

 ""shayt""? No? 

 ""shawt""? No? 

 Therefore, the word must be ""shalt""? 

 And L is not excluded? 

 So we guess ""shalt"".

 But we have to make sure? 

 Alternatively, it could be a less common word? But the game says ""valid English word""? So ""shalt"" should be acceptable? 

 We'll go with ""shalt"".
