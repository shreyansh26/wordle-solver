First, I need to make my first guess for the 5-letter word game. Since I have no prior feedback (it's the first guess), I should choose a word that maximizes the information I can get. That means picking a word with common letters and a good mix of vowels and consonants to cover possibilities.

Ideal first guesses in word games like Wordle often include words that use frequent letters. For example, words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ROAST"" are popular because they contain common letters.

Let me think about common letters in English words. According to letter frequency, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. So, I should include several of these in my guess.

I need a 5-letter word that uses different letters to avoid redundancy. For instance, ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E – all high-frequency letters. Similarly, ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E.

Another good one is ""ADIEU"" because it has three vowels (A, I, E, U – but U is less common), but it might not be optimal. Better to have a balance.

Since this is the first guess, I should aim for a word that's likely to be actual answers but also informative. But I don't know the secret word, so I just need a good starter.

I recall that ""SALET"" or ""CRATE"" are often recommended. Let's pick ""CRANE"" as a solid choice.

Now, for the response format: I need to think step by step, but since this is the first guess, there's nothing to deduce yet. So my reasoning is straightforward.

Later guesses will use feedback to refine.

So for now, I'll go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess.

Finally, I need to output my thought process within <thinking> tags, then the guess in <guess> tags.

Let me outline:

<thinking>
Since this is the first guess, I have no prior information. I should choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the chances of getting useful feedback. Letters like A, E, R, S, T, N, L, etc. are frequently used in English words. After considering options, ""CRANE"" is a good choice because it has C, R, A, N, E – all high-frequency letters. This will help identify which positions might be correct and which letters are in the word more efficiently.
</thinking>

Then:

<guess> crane </guess>

In the game rules, it says to use uppercase or lowercase? The example uses uppercase like ""STORM"", but in response, it might not matter. I'll use lowercase for consistency, but the problem doesn't specify. In the feedback example, it's uppercase, but for my output, I can do lowercase.

To match, perhaps I should use uppercase like the example. Let me check: ""Secret Word: BRISK"" and ""Guess 1: STORM"" are uppercase. So I should use uppercase for my guess.

Similarly, in my response, I'll use uppercase.

So, <guess> CRANE </guess>

But in the response format, it says ""guessed-word"" so it could be lowercase. However, to be consistent with the problem statement, I'll use uppercase.

Actually, in the response format: ""return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>."" It says ""guessed-word"" which might imply the word itself, not the case. But to avoid confusion, I'll use uppercase as in the examples.

Final decision: output CRANE in uppercase.

<thinking>
Since this is the first guess with no prior feedback, I need to select a word that maximizes information gain. I should choose a word with high-frequency letters in English to increase the likelihood of hitting correct letters, vowels, or consonants. Based on common averages, letters like A, E, R, S, T, N, L, and C appear frequently in 5-letter words. After considering options like ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", and ""CRATE"", I chose ""CRANE"" because it contains five distinct high-frequency letters (C, R, A, N, E), which is optimal for covering vowel and consonant possibilities. This will help me interpret the feedback efficiently for subsequent guesses.

That means picking a word with common letters and a good mix of vowels and consonants to cover possibilities.\n\nIdeal first guesses in word games like Wordle often include words that use frequent letters. For example, words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ROAST"" are popular because they contain common letters.\n\nLet me think about common letters in English words. According to letter frequency, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. So, I should include several of these in my guess.\n\nI need a 5-letter word that uses different letters to avoid redundancy. For instance, ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E – all high-frequency letters.

Hmm, the user just gave me feedback on my first guess of ""CRANE"". The feedback is C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(-). This means:

- C is not in the secret word at all
- R is not in the secret word 
- A is correct and in the right position (position 3)
- N is not in the word
- E is in the word but not in position 4

Since A is correct at position 3, the secret word has A as its third letter. E is present but not in fourth position. So E must be either in position 1,2 or 5.

Now C,R,N are eliminated - they can't be in the word. 

For my next guess, I need to:
- Keep A in position 3
- Include E but not in position 4
- Avoid C,R,N
- Use other common letters to test possibilities

The word has to be 5 letters. With A fixed at position 3, and E somewhere else.

Possible positions for E: 1,2,5. Not 3 (occupied by A) or 4 (wrong position per feedback).

Common English words fitting this:
- Must have _ _ A _ _ structure
- Contains E not at end if position 4? No, E cannot be in position 4

Brainstorm words: 
- Like ""BEADS"" - B,E,A,D,S. Has E in position 2? 
- Or ""LEAST"" - L,E,A,S,T. Position 2
- Or ""OCEAN"" but N is invalid (was x)
Avoid N

Better options:
- ""STEAD"" - S,T,E,A,D? Positions: S1,T2,E3? But position 3 is A, conflict
Must have E not in position 4 and A in 3.

So: position 1,2,5 can have E? Examples:
- ""MEALY"" - M1,E2,A3,L4,Y5. But E position 2? Feedback said E in word but not position 4 - position 2 should be ok.
Problem: letters must match.

Other words: 
- ""SPEAK"" - S1,P2,E3? But E cannot be in position 3 because that's A's position? Positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:E? Feedback says A is ✓ in position 3, so third letter must be A, so ""SPEAK"" has E in position 3? No: S-P-E-A-K? Positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:E, 4:A, 5:K - so position 3 is E? But we need A at position 3. Not matching.

We need _ _ A _ _ with A fixed at position 3.

And E must be in 1,2,4,5 but cannot be in 4 per feedback? Feedback: E(-) meaning wrong position, so E is not 5? Wait, in guess ""CRANE"" E was position 5, and it's marked ""-"" meaning present but wrong position? Exactly: in ""CRANE"", positions: C1,R2,A3,N4,E5. Feedback C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(-). So E is at position 5 and it's not correct position, so E could be elsewhere.

E cannot be in position 5? No: ""-"" means it's in the word but not in that position, so E is in the word but not position 5? Or could it be that position 5 is wrong, but E might be elsewhere?

Feedback symbol: ""-"" means letter is in word but wrong position.

For E: in position 5, but it's not correct position, meaning E might be in position 1,2,3,4? But position 3 is A, so E cannot be position 3. Position 4 we know from guess A is position 3, N in position 4? But N is not present.

Secret word: position 3 is A. Position 4 cannot be E because E is present and not at position 5? But position 4 could potentially have E?

Let's clarify: E is marked as ""-"" from position 5, meaning E is in the word but not position 5. So in secret word, E is at some other position: 1,2,3, or 4. But position 3 is taken by A, so E cannot be position 3. Position 4 is not occupied? Secret position 4 could be E? But E could be in position 1,2 or 4.

Forbidden: position 5 for E? Effectively, E must be in positions 1,2, or 4 of the secret word.

But in ""CRANE"", position 4 is N, and N is absent. So secret position 4 is unknown.

So E must be at position 1,2, or 4.

In next guess, I should try to cover multiple possibilities.

Also, C,R,N are excluded.

Good letters to try: S,T,L,O,D,I,B etc.

Words fitting _ _ A _ _ :

- With E in position 1: e.g., ""EAGLE"" but E in 1, A in 3? Positions: E1,A2,G3,L4,E5? Not A at 3?

Better:  _ _ A _ _ position: let positions be P1, P2, P3=A, P4, P5.

E can be P1, P2, or P4.

Possibilities:

If E at P1: words like E?A??
- ""ELAND"" but L and D? And N invalid? N is excluded.
Avoid N, C, R.

""ELAPS""? Not word.

""EVADE"" - E1,V2,A3,D4,E5? But D4, E5? But E at P5 is possible? But E is also at P1? In ""EVADE"", E is P1 and P5, which might be confusing, but secret may have E only once? Not specified, words can have duplicate letters, but Wordle usually no duplicates? Game rules not specified, assume words can have duplicates? Typically Wordle allows duplicates, but feedback might be tricky.

Check rules: ""each letter in your guess"" but no mention of duplicate letters. So possible.

But to simplify, assume distinct letters first? Not sure.

In feedback, for duplicates, it's handled specially.

But since previous guess ""CRANE"" all distinct letters, and no feedback indicating duplicates, I'll assume distinct letters for simplicity.

So secret word has distinct letters? Or not. Feedback doesn't show any, so probably safe to assume distinct for now.

Letters must be distinct except if word allows.

""EVADE"" has two E's.

Messy.

Simpler: try for common words.

Options:
- E as P1: words like ""ELATE"" - E1,L2,A3,T4,E5? Positions: E? No, ""ELATE"" E-L-A-T-E P1,L2,A3,T4,E5. So P3=A, P4=T can be anything.

But N invalid? ""ELATE"" has E,L,A,T,E - T in P4.

Feedback was E marked ""-"" for position 5 in ""CRANE"", but in ""ELATE"", E at P5? But E could be correct if present elsewhere.

I should pick a word with E in a new position and test P4 possibilities.

Since E must be at position 1,2, or 4, and not 5.

In next guess, put E at position 1 or 2 or 4 to see.

Also, include other common letters.

For example, put E at position 2: word format _ E A _ _
- Like ""LEAST"" - L,E,A,S,T? P1:L, P2:E, P3:A, P4:S, P5:T. This has E at P2.

""LEAST"" letters L,E,A,S,T. But A is already confirmed, so testing S,T,L.

C,R,N not included.

If E at P4: word like ? ? A E ? But positions P3=A, P4=E, so ? ? A E ? - like ""CHASE"" but C invalid? ""SHADE"" S,H,A,D,E? P1:S, P2:H, P3:A, P4:D, P5:E - E at P5? But E cannot be P5? No, this has E at P5.

""PLACE"" P invalid? P,L,A,C,E? C invalid.

""GRACE"" G,R,A,C,E? R and C invalid.

Hard to find with E at P4.

Better to try E at position 2.

""LEAST"" seems solid: common word, letters L,S,T are good testers.

""STEAL"" - S,T,E,A,L? Positions S1,T2,E3? P3 must be A, but here P3=E? No: S-T-E-A-L -> P1:S,P2:T,P3:E? But P3 must be A for secret, so conflict.

""PLEAT"" P,L,E,A,T? P1:P,P2:L,P3:E,P4:A? But P3 must be A? No, P4=A? Wrong position.

Words with P3=A: ""BEATS"" B,E,A,T,S? P1:B,P2:E,P3:A,P4:T,P5:S. E at position 2.

Similarly, ""YEARN"" but P2:E,P3:A, but Y and R,N? R and N invalid.

Avoid R,N,C.

So ""BEATS"" or ""MEALS"" M,E,A,L,S? P2:E.

""BEATS"" seems fine: B,E,A,T,S.

But E at P2? Yes.

""MEANS"" M,E,A,N,S? But N invalid.

""LEAPS"" L,E,A,P,S? P invalid? P is ok.

""HEADS"" H,E,A,D,S? D ok.

Now, choose between e.g. ""LEAST"", ""BEATS"", etc.

""LEAST"" has L,E,A,S,T - all good letters except A already known.

Perhaps ""SLATE"" S,L,A,T,E? But E at P5? Cannot have E at P5 per previous feedback? P5:E marked ""-"" meaning E not at P5, but it's in word, so in secret, E is not P5, so for guess, I can put E elsewhere.

In ""SLATE"", positions: S1,L2,A3,T4,E5? So E at P5 again? But feedback said E is not at P5, secret E is elsewhere, so guessing E at P5 again might not be helpful; better to put E at a different position to test.

In next guess, I should put E not at position 5, and preferably at position 1,2 or 4 to confirm where it is.

For example, put E at position 1: like ""EAGER"" but R invalid? ""EARLY"" E,A,R,L,Y? But A at P2? Not P3; P3 must be A.

Hard.

""EATER"" E,A,T,E,R? Duplicate E and R invalid.

""ELATE"" E,l,a,t,e? duplicate E.

""EDEMA"" not common.

Perhaps ""SUAVE"" S,U,A,V,E? P1:S,P2:U,P3:A,P4:V,P5:E? But E at P5? Same problem.

Put E at position 4.

Word like ? ? A E ?

For example, ""PLANE"" but N invalid? P,L,A,N,E? N.

""GRADE"" G,R,A,D,E? R invalid.

""SHALE"" S,H,A,L,E? P1:S,P2:H,P3:A,P4:L,P P5:E? E at P5 again.

Positions: to have E at P4, word P1, P2, P3=A, P4=E, P5=?

For example, ""SAWED"" S,A,W,E,D? But P2:H? No: S1,A2? Position conflict: P3 must be A, so P1 and P2 are sth else, P3=A, P4=E, P5=?

""AISLE"" A,I,S,L,E? But P1:A, P2:I, but P3=S? Not A.

""CAUSE"" C1,A2,U3,S4,E5? P3 not A.

Words like ""CHASE"" C,H,A,S,E? P1:C (invalid), P2:H, P3:A? Almost: C-H-A-S-E P1:C,P2:H,P3:A,P4:S,P5:E? P4=S, P5=E.

But E at P5? Same as before.

Difficult to find 5-letter word with P3=A and P4=E, and distinct letters.

Example: ""IRATE"" I,R,A,T,E? P1:I, P2:R (invalid), P3:A? P4:T, P5:E? E at P5.

""STAGE"" S,T,A,G,E? P1:S,P2:T,P3:A,P4:G,P5:E? E at P5.

Always E at end? Not necessarily.

""BASED"" B,A,S,E,D? But P3 not A: P1:B,P2:A,P3:S? Conflict.

Only if word has A at position 3, E at position 4: ""CHAFE"" C,H,A,F,E? P1:C,P2:H,P3:A,P4:F,P5:E? E at P5.

I think for common words, E at P4 requires P5 not E, but ending.

Perhaps ""ARISE"" but P3=I? No.

Give up on P4 for now.

So to test E position, put E at position 2 in next guess.

Choose a word like ""LEAST"": L,E,A,S,T.

Positions: L1,E2,A3,S4,T5

Here, E at position 2, which is possible per feedback.

Also, S and T are good letters to test.

If feedback shows E not at position 2, then E must be at position 1 or 4.

Similarly, other letters can give clues.

Another option: ""STEAD"" - but positions S1,T2,E3,A4,D5? But P3 must be A? Position conflict: P3=E not A.

Not good.

Or ""BEAST"" B,E,A,S,T? P1:B,P2:E,P3:A,P4:S,P5:T. Same as ""BEATS"" but different order.

""BEATS"" P4:T,P5:S vs ""BEAST"" P4:S,P5:T? Actually ""BEATS"" is word? Yes, ""beats"".

Both fine.

I'll go with ""LEAST"".

Letters: L,E,A,S,T - covers several consonants.

And A is at its correct position.

Now for output.
</think>
Based on the feedback from Guess 1 (""CRANE""):  
- C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(-)  

This indicates:  
1. A is correct and in position 3 (since it's marked ✓).  
2. E is in the secret word but not in position 5 (since E is marked -).  
3. C, R, and N are not in the secret word (all marked x).  

Constraints for the next guess:  
- Position 3 must be A.  
- E must be in the word but not position 5, so it must appear in positions 1, 2, or 4.  
- Avoid C, R, and N.  

To maximize information, I should:  
- Keep A in position 3 (required).  
- Test E in a new position to pinpoint its location—ideally position 2 or 4, as position 5 is invalid. Position 1 was less tested in the previous guess.  
- Include other high-frequency letters not yet tested (like S, T, L, D) to cover more possibilities.  

Good candidate words:  
- ""LEAST"": Tests E in position 2, with S and T as new consonants. Fits letter constraints (no C, R, N).  
- ""BEATS"": Also tests E in position 2, but B is less common than L.  
- ""STAND"": Avoided due to N (ineligible).  

I chose ""LEAST"" (L1, E2, A3, S4, T5):  
- Efficiently tests potential E positions while using common letters.  
- If E is misplaced here, it narrows E to position 1 or 4.  
- Tests S and T for presence/position.

<thinking>
Feedback Analysis:
- Secret has A in position 3: confirmed ✓ from previous guess.
5. E is in the word but not in position 5: must be in position 1, 2, or 4 of the secret word.
- Letters C, R, N are absent from the secret word.
Next Guess Strategy:
- Position 3 must be A.
- E should be placed in a new plausible position (2) to reduce uncertainty (not retesting position 5).
- Avoid using C, R, or N.
- Include new high-frequency consonants like S, T, L to gather more letter clues.
Selected ""LEAST"" because:
  - Positions: L1, E2, A3, S4, T5.
  - Tests E at position 2 (possible based on feedback).
  - Adds common letters S and T to check for presence.
  - Word avoids invalid letters and fits common words list.
</thinking>

<guess>LEAST</guess>",LEAST,"Hmm, the user just gave me feedback on my first guess of ""CRANE"". The feedback is C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(-). This means:

- C is not in the secret word at all
- R is not in the secret word 
- A is correct and in the right position (position 3)
- N is not in the word
- E is in the word but not in position 4

Since A is correct at position 3, the secret word has A as its third letter. E is present but not in fourth position. So E must be either in position 1,2 or 5.

Now C,R,N are eliminated - they can't be in the word. 

For my next guess, I need to:
- Keep A in position 3
- Include E but not in position 4
- Avoid C,R,N
- Use other common letters to test possibilities

The word has to be 5 letters. With A fixed at position 3, and E somewhere else.

Possible positions for E: 1,2,5. Not 3 (occupied by A) or 4 (wrong position per feedback).

Common English words fitting this:
- Must have _ _ A _ _ structure
- Contains E not at end if position 4? No, E cannot be in position 4

So: position 1,2,5 can have E? Examples:
- ""MEALY"" - M1,E2,A3,L4,Y5. But E position 2? Feedback said E in word but not position 4 - position 2 should be ok.
Problem: letters must match.

Other words: 
- ""SPEAK"" - S1,P2,E3? But E cannot be in position 3 because that's A's position? Positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:E? Feedback says A is ✓ in position 3, so third letter must be A, so ""SPEAK"" has E in position 3? No: S-P-E-A-K? Positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:E, 4:A, 5:K - so position 3 is E? But we need A at position 3. Not matching.

We need _ _ A _ _ with A fixed at position 3.

And E must be in 1,2,4,5 but cannot be in 4 per feedback? Feedback: E(-) meaning wrong position, so E is not 5? Wait, in guess ""CRANE"" E was position 5, and it's marked ""-"" meaning present but wrong position? Exactly: in ""CRANE"", positions: C1,R2,A3,N4,E5. Feedback C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(-). So E is at position 5 and it's not correct position, so E could be elsewhere.

E cannot be in position 5? No: ""-"" means it's in the word but not in that position, so E is in the word but not position 5? Or could it be that position 5 is wrong, but E might be elsewhere?

Feedback symbol: ""-"" means letter is in word but wrong position.

For E: in position 5, but it's not correct position, meaning E might be in position 1,2,3,4? But position 3 is A, so E cannot be position 3. Position 4 we know from guess A is position 3, N in position 4? But N is not present.

Secret word: position 3 is A. Position 4 cannot be E because E is present and not at position 5? But position 4 could potentially have E?

Let's clarify: E is marked as ""-"" from position 5, meaning E is in the word but not position 5. So in secret word, E is at some other position: 1,2,3, or 4. But position 3 is taken by A, so E cannot be position 3. Position 4 is not occupied? Secret position 4 could be E? But E could be in position 1,2 or 4.

Forbidden: position 5 for E? Effectively, E must be in positions 1,2, or 4 of the secret word.

But in ""CRANE"", position 4 is N, and N is absent. So secret position 4 is unknown.

So E must be at position 1,2, or 4.

In next guess, I should try to cover multiple possibilities.

Also, C,R,N are excluded.

Good letters to try: S,T,L,O,D,I,B etc.

Words fitting _ _ A _ _ :

- With E in position 1: e.g., ""EAGLE"" but E in 1, A in 3? Positions: E1,A2,G3,L4,E5? Not A at 3?

Better:  _ _ A _ _ position: let positions be P1, P2, P3=A, P4, P5.

E can be P1, P2, or P4.

Possibilities:

If E at P1: words like E?A??
- ""ELAND"" but L and D? And N invalid? N is excluded.
Avoid N, C, R.

""ELAPS""? Not word.

""EVADE"" - E1,V2,A3,D4,E5? But D4, E5? But E at P5 is possible? But E is also at P1? In ""EVADE"", E is P1 and P5, which might be confusing, but secret may have E only once? Not specified, words can have duplicate letters, but Wordle usually no duplicates? Game rules not specified, assume words can have duplicates? Typically Wordle allows duplicates, but feedback might be tricky.

Check rules: ""each letter in your guess"" but no mention of duplicate letters. So possible.

But to simplify, assume distinct letters first? Not sure.

In feedback, for duplicates, it's handled specially.

But since previous guess ""CRANE"" all distinct letters, and no feedback indicating duplicates, I'll assume distinct letters for simplicity.

So secret word has distinct letters? Or not. Feedback doesn't show any, so probably safe to assume distinct for now.

Letters must be distinct except if word allows.

""EVADE"" has two E's.

Messy.

Simpler: try for common words.

Options:
- E as P1: words like ""ELATE"" - E1,L2,A3,T4,E5? Positions: E? No, ""ELATE"" E-L-A-T-E P1,L2,A3,T4,E5. So P3=A, P4=T can be anything.

But N invalid? ""ELATE"" has E,L,A,T,E - T in P4.

Feedback was E marked ""-"" for position 5 in ""CRANE"", but in ""ELATE"", E at P5? But E could be correct if present elsewhere.

I should pick a word with E in a new position and test P4 possibilities.

Since E must be at position 1,2, or 4, and not 5.

In next guess, put E at position 1 or 2 or 4 to see.

Also, include other common letters.

For example, put E at position 2: word format _ E A _ _
- Like ""LEAST"" - L,E,A,S,T? P1:L, P2:E, P3:A, P4:S, P5:T. This has E at P2.

""LEAST"" letters L,E,A,S,T. But A is already confirmed, so testing S,T,L.

C,R,N not included.

If E at P4: word like ? ? A E ? But positions P3=A, P4=E, so ? ? A E ? - like ""CHASE"" but C invalid? ""SHADE"" S,H,A,D,E? P1:S, P2:H, P3:A, P4:D, P5:E - E at P5? But E cannot be P5? No, this has E at P5.

""PLACE"" P invalid? P,L,A,C,E? C invalid.

""GRACE"" G,R,A,C,E? R and C invalid.

Hard to find with E at P4.

Better to try E at position 2.

""LEAST"" seems solid: common word, letters L,S,T are good testers.

""STEAL"" - S,T,E,A,L? Positions S1,T2,E3? P3 must be A, but here P3=E? No: S-T-E-A-L -> P1:S,P2:T,P3:E? But P3 must be A for secret, so conflict.

""PLEAT"" P,L,E,A,T? P1:P,P2:L,P3:E,P4:A? But P3 must be A? No, P4=A? Wrong position.

Words with P3=A: ""BEATS"" B,E,A,T,S? P1:B,P2:E,P3:A,P4:T,P5:S. E at position 2.

Similarly, ""YEARN"" but P2:E,P3:A, but Y and R,N? R and N invalid.

Avoid R,N,C.

So ""BEATS"" or ""MEALS"" M,E,A,L,S? P2:E.

""BEATS"" seems fine: B,E,A,T,S.

But E at P2? Yes.

""MEANS"" M,E,A,N,S? But N invalid.

""LEAPS"" L,E,A,P,S? P invalid? P is ok.

""HEADS"" H,E,A,D,S? D ok.

Now, choose between e.g. ""LEAST"", ""BEATS"", etc.

""LEAST"" has L,E,A,S,T - all good letters except A already known.

Perhaps ""SLATE"" S,L,A,T,E? But E at P5? Cannot have E at P5 per previous feedback? P5:E marked ""-"" meaning E not at P5, but it's in word, so in secret, E is not P5, so for guess, I can put E elsewhere.

In ""SLATE"", positions: S1,L2,A3,T4,E5? So E at P5 again? But feedback said E is not at P5, secret E is elsewhere, so guessing E at P5 again might not be helpful; better to put E at a different position to test.

In next guess, I should put E not at position 5, and preferably at position 1,2 or 4 to confirm where it is.

For example, put E at position 1: like ""EAGER"" but R invalid? ""EARLY"" E,A,R,L,Y? But A at P2? Not P3; P3 must be A.

Hard.

""EATER"" E,A,T,E,R? Duplicate E and R invalid.

""ELATE"" E,l,a,t,e? duplicate E.

""EDEMA"" not common.

Perhaps ""SUAVE"" S,U,A,V,E? P1:S,P2:U,P3:A,P4:V,P5:E? But E at P5? Same problem.

Put E at position 4.

Word like ? ? A E ?

For example, ""PLANE"" but N invalid? P,L,A,N,E? N.

""GRADE"" G,R,A,D,E? R invalid.

""SHALE"" S,H,A,L,E? P1:S,P2:H,P3:A,P4:L,P P5:E? E at P5 again.

Positions: to have E at P4, word P1, P2, P3=A, P4=E, P5=?

For example, ""SAWED"" S,A,W,E,D? But P2:H? No: S1,A2? Position conflict: P3 must be A, so P1 and P2 are sth else, P3=A, P4=E, P5=?

""AISLE"" A,I,S,L,E? But P1:A, P2:I, but P3=S? Not A.

""CAUSE"" C1,A2,U3,S4,E5? P3 not A.

Words like ""CHASE"" C,H,A,S,E? P1:C (invalid), P2:H, P3:A? Almost: C-H-A-S-E P1:C,P2:H,P3:A,P4:S,P5:E? P4=S, P5=E.

But E at P5? Same as before.

Difficult to find 5-letter word with P3=A and P4=E, and distinct letters.

Example: ""IRATE"" I,R,A,T,E? P1:I, P2:R (invalid), P3:A? P4:T, P5:E? E at P5.

""STAGE"" S,T,A,G,E? P1:S,P2:T,P3:A,P4:G,P5:E? E at P5.

Always E at end? Not necessarily.

""BASED"" B,A,S,E,D? But P3 not A: P1:B,P2:A,P3:S? Conflict.

Only if word has A at position 3, E at position 4: ""CHAFE"" C,H,A,F,E? P1:C,P2:H,P3:A,P4:F,P5:E? E at P5.

I think for common words, E at P4 requires P5 not E, but ending.

Perhaps ""ARISE"" but P3=I? No.

Give up on P4 for now.

So to test E position, put E at position 2 in next guess.

Choose a word like ""LEAST"": L,E,A,S,T.

Positions: L1,E2,A3,S4,T5

Here, E at position 2, which is possible per feedback.

Also, S and T are good letters to test.

If feedback shows E not at position 2, then E must be at position 1 or 4.

Similarly, other letters can give clues.

Another option: ""STEAD"" - but positions S1,T2,E3,A4,D5? But P3 must be A? Position conflict: P3=E not A.

Not good.

Or ""BEAST"" B,E,A,S,T? P1:B,P2:E,P3:A,P4:S,P5:T. Same as ""BEATS"" but different order.

""BEATS"" P4:T,P5:S vs ""BEAST"" P4:S,P5:T? Actually ""BEATS"" is word? Yes, ""beats"".

Both fine.

I'll go with ""LEAST"".

Letters: L,E,A,S,T - covers several consonants.

And A is at its correct position.

Now for output.Based on the feedback from Guess 1 (""CRANE""):  
- C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(-)  

This indicates:  
1. A is correct and in position 3 (since it's marked ✓).  
2. E is in the secret word but not in position 5 (since E is marked -).  
3. C, R, and N are not in the secret word (all marked x).  

Constraints for the next guess:  
- Position 3 must be A.  
- E must be in the word but not position 5, so it must appear in positions 1, 2, or 4.  
- Avoid C, R, and N.  

To maximize information, I should:  
- Keep A in position 3 (required).  
- Test E in a new position to pinpoint its location—ideally position 2 or 4, as position 5 is invalid. Position 1 was less tested in the previous guess.  
- Include other high-frequency letters not yet tested (like S, T, L, D) to cover more possibilities.  

Good candidate words:  
- ""LEAST"": Tests E in position 2, with S and T as new consonants. Fits letter constraints (no C, R, N).  
- ""BEATS"": Also tests E in position 2, but B is less common than L.  
- ""STAND"": Avoided due to N (ineligible).  

I chose ""LEAST"" (L1, E2, A3, S4, T5):  
- Efficiently tests potential E positions while using common letters.  
- If E is misplaced here, it narrows E to position 1 or 4.  
- Tests S and T for presence/position.

<thinking>
Feedback Analysis:
- Secret has A in position 3: confirmed ✓ from previous guess.
5. E is in the word but not in position 5: must be in position 1, 2, or 4 of the secret word.
- Letters C, R, N are absent from the secret word.
Next Guess Strategy:
- Position 3 must be A.
- E should be placed in a new plausible position (2) to reduce uncertainty (not retesting position 5).
- Avoid using C, R, or N.
- Include new high-frequency consonants like S, T, L to gather more letter clues.
Selected ""LEAST"" because:
  - Positions: L1, E2, A3, S4, T5.
  - Tests E at position 2 (possible based on feedback).
  - Adds common letters S and T to check for presence.
  - Word avoids invalid letters and fits common words list.

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,HEATH,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>First, I need to make my first guess for the 5-letter word game. Since I have no prior feedback (it's the first guess), I should choose a word that maximizes the information I can get. That means picking a word with common letters and a good mix of vowels and consonants to cover possibilities.

Ideal first guesses in word games like Wordle often include words that use frequent letters. For example, words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ROAST"" are popular because they contain common letters.

Let me think about common letters in English words. According to letter frequency, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. So, I should include several of these in my guess.

I need a 5-letter word that uses different letters to avoid redundancy. For instance, ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E – all high-frequency letters. Similarly, ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E.

Another good one is ""ADIEU"" because it has three vowels (A, I, E, U – but U is less common), but it might not be optimal. Better to have a balance.

Since this is the first guess, I should aim for a word that's likely to be actual answers but also informative. But I don't know the secret word, so I just need a good starter.

I recall that ""SALET"" or ""CRATE"" are often recommended. Let's pick ""CRANE"" as a solid choice.

Now, for the response format: I need to think step by step, but since this is the first guess, there's nothing to deduce yet. So my reasoning is straightforward.

Later guesses will use feedback to refine.

So for now, I'll go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess.

Finally, I need to output my thought process within <thinking> tags, then the guess in <guess> tags.

Let me outline:

<thinking>
Since this is the first guess, I have no prior information. I should choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the chances of getting useful feedback. Letters like A, E, R, S, T, N, L, etc. are frequently used in English words. After considering options, ""CRANE"" is a good choice because it has C, R, A, N, E – all high-frequency letters. This will help identify which positions might be correct and which letters are in the word more efficiently.
</thinking>

Then:

<guess> crane </guess>

In the game rules, it says to use uppercase or lowercase? The example uses uppercase like ""STORM"", but in response, it might not matter. I'll use lowercase for consistency, but the problem doesn't specify. In the feedback example, it's uppercase, but for my output, I can do lowercase.

To match, perhaps I should use uppercase like the example. Let me check: ""Secret Word: BRISK"" and ""Guess 1: STORM"" are uppercase. So I should use uppercase for my guess.

Similarly, in my response, I'll use uppercase.

So, <guess> CRANE </guess>

But in the response format, it says ""guessed-word"" so it could be lowercase. However, to be consistent with the problem statement, I'll use uppercase.

Actually, in the response format: ""return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>."" It says ""guessed-word"" which might imply the word itself, not the case. But to avoid confusion, I'll use uppercase as in the examples.

Final decision: output CRANE in uppercase.<thinking>
Since this is the first guess with no prior feedback, I need to select a word that maximizes information gain. I should choose a word with high-frequency letters in English to increase the likelihood of hitting correct letters, vowels, or consonants. Based on common averages, letters like A, E, R, S, T, N, L, and C appear frequently in 5-letter words. After considering options like ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", and ""CRATE"", I chose ""CRANE"" because it contains five distinct high-frequency letters (C, R, A, N, E), which is optimal for covering vowel and consonant possibilities. This will help me interpret the feedback efficiently for subsequent guesses.

Guess 2: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>Hmm, the user just gave me feedback on my first guess of ""CRANE"". The feedback is C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(-). This means:

- C is not in the secret word at all
- R is not in the secret word 
- A is correct and in the right position (position 3)
- N is not in the word
- E is in the word but not in position 4

Since A is correct at position 3, the secret word has A as its third letter. E is present but not in fourth position. So E must be either in position 1,2 or 5.

Now C,R,N are eliminated - they can't be in the word. 

For my next guess, I need to:
- Keep A in position 3
- Include E but not in position 4
- Avoid C,R,N
- Use other common letters to test possibilities

The word has to be 5 letters. With A fixed at position 3, and E somewhere else.

Possible positions for E: 1,2,5. Not 3 (occupied by A) or 4 (wrong position per feedback).

Common English words fitting this:
- Must have _ _ A _ _ structure
- Contains E not at end if position 4? No, E cannot be in position 4

Brainstorm words: 
- Like ""BEADS"" - B,E,A,D,S. Has E in position 2? 
- Or ""LEAST"" - L,E,A,S,T. Position 2
- Or ""OCEAN"" but N is invalid (was x)
Avoid N

Better options:
- ""STEAD"" - S,T,E,A,D? Positions: S1,T2,E3? But position 3 is A, conflict
Must have E not in position 4 and A in 3.

So: position 1,2,5 can have E? Examples:
- ""MEALY"" - M1,E2,A3,L4,Y5. But E position 2? Feedback said E in word but not position 4 - position 2 should be ok.
Problem: letters must match.

Other words: 
- ""SPEAK"" - S1,P2,E3? But E cannot be in position 3 because that's A's position? Positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:E? Feedback says A is ✓ in position 3, so third letter must be A, so ""SPEAK"" has E in position 3? No: S-P-E-A-K? Positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:E, 4:A, 5:K - so position 3 is E? But we need A at position 3. Not matching.

We need _ _ A _ _ with A fixed at position 3.

And E must be in 1,2,4,5 but cannot be in 4 per feedback? Feedback: E(-) meaning wrong position, so E is not 5? Wait, in guess ""CRANE"" E was position 5, and it's marked ""-"" meaning present but wrong position? Exactly: in ""CRANE"", positions: C1,R2,A3,N4,E5. Feedback C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(-). So E is at position 5 and it's not correct position, so E could be elsewhere.

E cannot be in position 5? No: ""-"" means it's in the word but not in that position, so E is in the word but not position 5? Or could it be that position 5 is wrong, but E might be elsewhere?

Feedback symbol: ""-"" means letter is in word but wrong position.

For E: in position 5, but it's not correct position, meaning E might be in position 1,2,3,4? But position 3 is A, so E cannot be position 3. Position 4 we know from guess A is position 3, N in position 4? But N is not present.

Secret word: position 3 is A. Position 4 cannot be E because E is present and not at position 5? But position 4 could potentially have E?

Let's clarify: E is marked as ""-"" from position 5, meaning E is in the word but not position 5. So in secret word, E is at some other position: 1,2,3, or 4. But position 3 is taken by A, so E cannot be position 3. Position 4 is not occupied? Secret position 4 could be E? But E could be in position 1,2 or 4.

Forbidden: position 5 for E? Effectively, E must be in positions 1,2, or 4 of the secret word.

But in ""CRANE"", position 4 is N, and N is absent. So secret position 4 is unknown.

So E must be at position 1,2, or 4.

In next guess, I should try to cover multiple possibilities.

Also, C,R,N are excluded.

Good letters to try: S,T,L,O,D,I,B etc.

Words fitting _ _ A _ _ :

- With E in position 1: e.g., ""EAGLE"" but E in 1, A in 3? Positions: E1,A2,G3,L4,E5? Not A at 3?

Better:  _ _ A _ _ position: let positions be P1, P2, P3=A, P4, P5.

E can be P1, P2, or P4.

Possibilities:

If E at P1: words like E?A??
- ""ELAND"" but L and D? And N invalid? N is excluded.
Avoid N, C, R.

""ELAPS""? Not word.

""EVADE"" - E1,V2,A3,D4,E5? But D4, E5? But E at P5 is possible? But E is also at P1? In ""EVADE"", E is P1 and P5, which might be confusing, but secret may have E only once? Not specified, words can have duplicate letters, but Wordle usually no duplicates? Game rules not specified, assume words can have duplicates? Typically Wordle allows duplicates, but feedback might be tricky.

Check rules: ""each letter in your guess"" but no mention of duplicate letters. So possible.

But to simplify, assume distinct letters first? Not sure.

In feedback, for duplicates, it's handled specially.

But since previous guess ""CRANE"" all distinct letters, and no feedback indicating duplicates, I'll assume distinct letters for simplicity.

So secret word has distinct letters? Or not. Feedback doesn't show any, so probably safe to assume distinct for now.

Letters must be distinct except if word allows.

""EVADE"" has two E's.

Messy.

Simpler: try for common words.

Options:
- E as P1: words like ""ELATE"" - E1,L2,A3,T4,E5? Positions: E? No, ""ELATE"" E-L-A-T-E P1,L2,A3,T4,E5. So P3=A, P4=T can be anything.

But N invalid? ""ELATE"" has E,L,A,T,E - T in P4.

Feedback was E marked ""-"" for position 5 in ""CRANE"", but in ""ELATE"", E at P5? But E could be correct if present elsewhere.

I should pick a word with E in a new position and test P4 possibilities.

Since E must be at position 1,2, or 4, and not 5.

In next guess, put E at position 1 or 2 or 4 to see.

Also, include other common letters.

For example, put E at position 2: word format _ E A _ _
- Like ""LEAST"" - L,E,A,S,T? P1:L, P2:E, P3:A, P4:S, P5:T. This has E at P2.

""LEAST"" letters L,E,A,S,T. But A is already confirmed, so testing S,T,L.

C,R,N not included.

If E at P4: word like ? ? A E ? But positions P3=A, P4=E, so ? ? A E ? - like ""CHASE"" but C invalid? ""SHADE"" S,H,A,D,E? P1:S, P2:H, P3:A, P4:D, P5:E - E at P5? But E cannot be P5? No, this has E at P5.

""PLACE"" P invalid? P,L,A,C,E? C invalid.

""GRACE"" G,R,A,C,E? R and C invalid.

Hard to find with E at P4.

Better to try E at position 2.

""LEAST"" seems solid: common word, letters L,S,T are good testers.

""STEAL"" - S,T,E,A,L? Positions S1,T2,E3? P3 must be A, but here P3=E? No: S-T-E-A-L -> P1:S,P2:T,P3:E? But P3 must be A for secret, so conflict.

""PLEAT"" P,L,E,A,T? P1:P,P2:L,P3:E,P4:A? But P3 must be A? No, P4=A? Wrong position.

Words with P3=A: ""BEATS"" B,E,A,T,S? P1:B,P2:E,P3:A,P4:T,P5:S. E at position 2.

Similarly, ""YEARN"" but P2:E,P3:A, but Y and R,N? R and N invalid.

Avoid R,N,C.

So ""BEATS"" or ""MEALS"" M,E,A,L,S? P2:E.

""BEATS"" seems fine: B,E,A,T,S.

But E at P2? Yes.

""MEANS"" M,E,A,N,S? But N invalid.

""LEAPS"" L,E,A,P,S? P invalid? P is ok.

""HEADS"" H,E,A,D,S? D ok.

Now, choose between e.g. ""LEAST"", ""BEATS"", etc.

""LEAST"" has L,E,A,S,T - all good letters except A already known.

Perhaps ""SLATE"" S,L,A,T,E? But E at P5? Cannot have E at P5 per previous feedback? P5:E marked ""-"" meaning E not at P5, but it's in word, so in secret, E is not P5, so for guess, I can put E elsewhere.

In ""SLATE"", positions: S1,L2,A3,T4,E5? So E at P5 again? But feedback said E is not at P5, secret E is elsewhere, so guessing E at P5 again might not be helpful; better to put E at a different position to test.

In next guess, I should put E not at position 5, and preferably at position 1,2 or 4 to confirm where it is.

For example, put E at position 1: like ""EAGER"" but R invalid? ""EARLY"" E,A,R,L,Y? But A at P2? Not P3; P3 must be A.

Hard.

""EATER"" E,A,T,E,R? Duplicate E and R invalid.

""ELATE"" E,l,a,t,e? duplicate E.

""EDEMA"" not common.

Perhaps ""SUAVE"" S,U,A,V,E? P1:S,P2:U,P3:A,P4:V,P5:E? But E at P5? Same problem.

Put E at position 4.

Word like ? ? A E ?

For example, ""PLANE"" but N invalid? P,L,A,N,E? N.

""GRADE"" G,R,A,D,E? R invalid.

""SHALE"" S,H,A,L,E? P1:S,P2:H,P3:A,P4:L,P P5:E? E at P5 again.

Positions: to have E at P4, word P1, P2, P3=A, P4=E, P5=?

For example, ""SAWED"" S,A,W,E,D? But P2:H? No: S1,A2? Position conflict: P3 must be A, so P1 and P2 are sth else, P3=A, P4=E, P5=?

""AISLE"" A,I,S,L,E? But P1:A, P2:I, but P3=S? Not A.

""CAUSE"" C1,A2,U3,S4,E5? P3 not A.

Words like ""CHASE"" C,H,A,S,E? P1:C (invalid), P2:H, P3:A? Almost: C-H-A-S-E P1:C,P2:H,P3:A,P4:S,P5:E? P4=S, P5=E.

But E at P5? Same as before.

Difficult to find 5-letter word with P3=A and P4=E, and distinct letters.

Example: ""IRATE"" I,R,A,T,E? P1:I, P2:R (invalid), P3:A? P4:T, P5:E? E at P5.

""STAGE"" S,T,A,G,E? P1:S,P2:T,P3:A,P4:G,P5:E? E at P5.

Always E at end? Not necessarily.

""BASED"" B,A,S,E,D? But P3 not A: P1:B,P2:A,P3:S? Conflict.

Only if word has A at position 3, E at position 4: ""CHAFE"" C,H,A,F,E? P1:C,P2:H,P3:A,P4:F,P5:E? E at P5.

I think for common words, E at P4 requires P5 not E, but ending.

Perhaps ""ARISE"" but P3=I? No.

Give up on P4 for now.

So to test E position, put E at position 2 in next guess.

Choose a word like ""LEAST"": L,E,A,S,T.

Positions: L1,E2,A3,S4,T5

Here, E at position 2, which is possible per feedback.

Also, S and T are good letters to test.

If feedback shows E not at position 2, then E must be at position 1 or 4.

Similarly, other letters can give clues.

Another option: ""STEAD"" - but positions S1,T2,E3,A4,D5? But P3 must be A? Position conflict: P3=E not A.

Not good.

Or ""BEAST"" B,E,A,S,T? P1:B,P2:E,P3:A,P4:S,P5:T. Same as ""BEATS"" but different order.

""BEATS"" P4:T,P5:S vs ""BEAST"" P4:S,P5:T? Actually ""BEATS"" is word? Yes, ""beats"".

Both fine.

I'll go with ""LEAST"".

Letters: L,E,A,S,T - covers several consonants.

And A is at its correct position.

Now for output.Based on the feedback from Guess 1 (""CRANE""):  
- C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(-)  

This indicates:  
1. A is correct and in position 3 (since it's marked ✓).  
2. E is in the secret word but not in position 5 (since E is marked -).  
3. C, R, and N are not in the secret word (all marked x).  

Constraints for the next guess:  
- Position 3 must be A.  
- E must be in the word but not position 5, so it must appear in positions 1, 2, or 4.  
- Avoid C, R, and N.  

To maximize information, I should:  
- Keep A in position 3 (required).  
- Test E in a new position to pinpoint its location—ideally position 2 or 4, as position 5 is invalid. Position 1 was less tested in the previous guess.  
- Include other high-frequency letters not yet tested (like S, T, L, D) to cover more possibilities.  

Good candidate words:  
- ""LEAST"": Tests E in position 2, with S and T as new consonants. Fits letter constraints (no C, R, N).  
- ""BEATS"": Also tests E in position 2, but B is less common than L.  
- ""STAND"": Avoided due to N (ineligible).  

I chose ""LEAST"" (L1, E2, A3, S4, T5):  
- Efficiently tests potential E positions while using common letters.  
- If E is misplaced here, it narrows E to position 1 or 4.  
- Tests S and T for presence/position.

<thinking>
Feedback Analysis:
- Secret has A in position 3: confirmed ✓ from previous guess.
5. E is in the word but not in position 5: must be in position 1, 2, or 4 of the secret word.
- Letters C, R, N are absent from the secret word.
Next Guess Strategy:
- Position 3 must be A.
- E should be placed in a new plausible position (2) to reduce uncertainty (not retesting position 5).
- Avoid using C, R, or N.
- Include new high-frequency consonants like S, T, L to gather more letter clues.
Selected ""LEAST"" because:
  - Positions: L1, E2, A3, S4, T5.
  - Tests E at position 2 (possible based on feedback).
  - Adds common letters S and T to check for presence.
  - Word avoids invalid letters and fits common words list.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: tags.

Let me outline:

<thinking>
Since this is the first guess, I have no prior information. I should choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the chances of getting useful feedback. Letters like A, E, R, S, T, N, L, etc. are frequently used in English words. After considering options, ""CRANE"" is a good choice because it has C, R, A, N, E – all high-frequency letters. This will help identify which positions might be correct and which letters are in the word more efficiently.

Since I have no prior feedback (it\'s the first guess), I should choose a word that maximizes the information I can get. That means picking a word with common letters and a good mix of vowels and consonants to cover possibilities.\n\nIdeal first guesses in word games like Wordle often include words that use frequent letters. For example, words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ROAST"" are popular because they contain common letters.\n\nLet me think about common letters in English words. According to letter frequency, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. So, I should include several of these in my guess.\n\nI need a 5-letter word that uses different letters to avoid redundancy. For instance, ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E – all high-frequency letters. Similarly, ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E.\n\nAnother good one is ""ADIEU"" because it has three vowels (A, I, E, U – but U is less common), but it might not be optimal. Better to have a balance.\n\nSince this is the first guess, I should aim for a word that\'s likely to be actual answers but also informative. But I don\'t know the secret word, so I just need a good starter.\n\nI recall that ""SALET"" or ""CRATE"" are often recommended. Let\'s pick ""CRANE"" as a solid choice.\n\nNow, for the response format: I need to think step by step, but since this is the first guess, there\'s nothing to deduce yet. So my reasoning is straightforward.\n\nLater guesses will use feedback to refine.\n\nSo for now, I\'ll go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess.\n\nFinally, I need to output my thought process within <thinking> tags, then the guess in <guess> tags.\n\nLet me outline:\n\n<thinking>\nSince this is the first guess, I have no prior information.

The example uses uppercase like ""STORM"", but in response, it might not matter. I\'ll use lowercase for consistency, but the problem doesn\'t specify. In the feedback example, it\'s uppercase, but for my output, I can do lowercase.\n\nTo match, perhaps I should use uppercase like the example. Let me check: ""Secret Word: BRISK"" and ""Guess 1: STORM"" are uppercase. So I should use uppercase for my guess.\n\nSimilarly, in my response, I\'ll use uppercase.\n\nSo, <guess> CRANE </guess>\n\nBut in the response format, it says ""guessed-word"" so it could be lowercase. However, to be consistent with the problem statement, I\'ll use uppercase.\n\nActually, in the response format: ""return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>."" It says ""guessed-word"" which might imply the word itself, not the case. But to avoid confusion, I\'ll use uppercase as in the examples.\n\nFinal decision: output CRANE in uppercase.<thinking>\nSince this is the first guess with no prior feedback, I need to select a word that maximizes information gain.

E is present but not in fourth position.

But E cannot be in position 3 because that\'s A\'s position? Positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:E? Feedback says A is ✓ in position 3, so third letter must be A, so ""SPEAK"" has E in position 3? No: S-P-E-A-K? Positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:E, 4:A, 5:K - so position 3 is E? But we need A at position 3. Not matching.\n\nWe need _ _ A _ _ with A fixed at position 3.\n\nAnd E must be in 1,2,4,5 but cannot be in 4 per feedback? Feedback: E(-) meaning wrong position, so E is not 5? Wait, in guess ""CRANE"" E was position 5, and it\'s marked ""-"" meaning present but wrong position? Exactly: in ""CRANE"", positions: C1,R2,A3,N4,E5. Feedback C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(-). So E is at position 5 and it\'s not correct position, so E could be elsewhere.\n\nE cannot be in position 5? No: ""-"" means it\'s in the word but not in that position, so E is in the word but not position 5? Or could it be that position 5 is wrong, but E might be elsewhere?\n\nFeedback symbol: ""-"" means letter is in word but wrong position.\n\nFor E: in position 5, but it\'s not correct position, meaning E might be in position 1,2,3,4? But position 3 is A, so E cannot be position 3. Position 4 we know from guess A is position 3, N in position 4? But N is not present.\n\nSecret word: position 3 is A. Position 4 cannot be E because E is present and not at position 5? But position 4 could potentially have E?\n\nLet\'s clarify: E is marked as ""-"" from position 5, meaning E is in the word but not position 5. So in secret word, E is at some other position: 1,2,3, or 4. But position 3 is taken by A, so E cannot be position 3. Position 4 is not occupied? Secret position 4 could be E? But E could be in position 1,2 or 4.\n\nForbidden: position 5 for E? Effectively, E must be in positions 1,2, or 4 of the secret word.\n\nBut in ""CRANE"", position 4 is N, and N is absent. So secret position 4 is unknown.\n\nSo E must be at position 1,2, or 4.\n\nIn next guess, I should try to cover multiple possibilities.\n\nAlso, C,R,N are excluded.\n\nGood letters to try: S,T,L,O,D,I,B etc.\n\nWords fitting _ _ A _ _ :\n\n- With E in position 1: e.g., ""EAGLE"" but E in 1, A in 3? Positions: E1,A2,G3,L4,E5? Not A at 3?\n\nBetter:  _ _ A _ _ position: let positions be P1, P2, P3=A, P4, P5.\n\nE can be P1, P2, or P4.\n\nPossibilities:\n\nIf E at P1: words like E?A??\n- ""ELAND"" but L and D? And N invalid? N is excluded.\nAvoid N, C, R.\n\n""ELAPS""? Not word.\n\n""EVADE"" - E1,V2,A3,D4,E5? But D4, E5? But E at P5 is possible? But E is also at P1? In ""EVADE"", E is P1 and P5, which might be confusing, but secret may have E only once? Not specified, words can have duplicate letters, but Wordle usually no duplicates? Game rules not specified, assume words can have duplicates? Typically Wordle allows duplicates, but feedback might be tricky.\n\nCheck rules: ""each letter in your guess"" but no mention of duplicate letters. So possible.\n\nBut to simplify, assume distinct letters first? Not sure.\n\nIn feedback, for duplicates, it\'s handled specially.\n\nBut since previous guess ""CRANE"" all distinct letters, and no feedback indicating duplicates, I\'ll assume distinct letters for simplicity.\n\nSo secret word has distinct letters? Or not. Feedback doesn\'t show any, so probably safe to assume distinct for now.\n\nLetters must be distinct except if word allows.\n\n""EVADE"" has two E\'s.\n\nMessy.\n\nSimpler: try for common words.\n\nOptions:\n- E as P1: words like ""ELATE"" - E1,L2,A3,T4,E5? Positions: E? No, ""ELATE"" E-L-A-T-E P1,L2,A3,T4,E5. So P3=A, P4=T can be anything.\n\nBut N invalid? ""ELATE"" has E,L,A,T,E - T in P4.\n\nFeedback was E marked ""-"" for position 5 in ""CRANE"", but in ""ELATE"", E at P5?

P3 must be A, but here P3=E? No: S-T-E-A-L -> P1:S,P2:T,P3:E? But P3 must be A for secret, so conflict.\n\n""PLEAT"" P,L,E,A,T? P1:P,P2:L,P3:E,P4:A? But P3 must be A? No, P4=A? Wrong position.\n\nWords with P3=A: ""BEATS"" B,E,A,T,S? P1:B,P2:E,P3:A,P4:T,P5:S. E at position 2.\n\nSimilarly, ""YEARN"" but P2:E,P3:A, but Y and R,N? R and N invalid.\n\nAvoid R,N,C.\n\nSo ""BEATS"" or ""MEALS"" M,E,A,L,S? P2:E.\n\n""BEATS"" seems fine: B,E,A,T,S.\n\nBut E at P2? Yes.\n\n""MEANS"" M,E,A,N,S? But N invalid.\n\n""LEAPS"" L,E,A,P,S? P invalid? P is ok.\n\n""HEADS"" H,E,A,D,S? D ok.\n\nNow, choose between e.g. ""LEAST"", ""BEATS"", etc.\n\n""LEAST"" has L,E,A,S,T - all good letters except A already known.\n\nPerhaps ""SLATE"" S,L,A,T,E? But E at P5? Cannot have E at P5 per previous feedback? P5:E marked ""-"" meaning E not at P5, but it\'s in word, so in secret, E is not P5, so for guess, I can put E elsewhere.\n\nIn ""SLATE"", positions: S1,L2,A3,T4,E5? So E at P5 again? But feedback said E is not at P5, secret E is elsewhere, so guessing E at P5 again might not be helpful; better to put E at a different position to test.\n\nIn next guess, I should put E not at position 5, and preferably at position 1,2 or 4 to confirm where it is.\n\nFor example, put E at position 1: like ""EAGER"" but R invalid?

Position 1 was less tested in the previous guess.  \n- Include other high-frequency letters not yet tested (like S, T, L, D) to cover more possibilities.  \n\nGood candidate words:  \n- ""LEAST"": Tests E in position 2, with S and T as new consonants.

I should choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the chances of getting useful feedback. Letters like A, E, R, S, T, N, L, etc. are frequently used in English words.

This will help identify which positions might be correct and which letters are in the word more efficiently.\n</thinking>\n\nThen:\n\n<guess> crane -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.\nGuess 2: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 3: LEAST -> FEEDBACK: L(x) E(✓) A(✓) S(x) T(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two previous guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)
Meaning:
- A is correct and in position 3.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.
- C, R, N are not in the word.

Guess 2: LEAST -> L(x) E(✓) A(✓) S(x) T(-)
Meaning:
- E is correct and in position 2 (since it's marked ✓ for position 2 in LEAST).
- A is correct and in position 3 (as before, and confirmed again).
- T is in the word but not in position 5 (marked - for position 5).
- L and S are not in the word.

Now, combining the feedback:

1. Position 2 is E (from LEAST feedback: E(✓)).
2. Position 3 is A (confirmed in both).
3. E is in position 2, which satisfies the previous hint that E is in the word and not in position 5.
4. T is in the word but not in position 5. Since position 2 is E and position 3 is A, T must be in position 1 or 4 (since position 5 is not allowed for T per feedback).
5. Letters not in the word: C, R, N, L, S (from both guesses).

Also, from CRANE, E was not in position 5, but now we know it's in position 2.

Current knowns:
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: A
- T is present, but not in position 5 -> so must be in 1 or 4.

The secret word pattern: _ E A _ _

We need to fill positions 1, 4, and 5.

Constraints:
- Position 1: can be T or another letter (but T might be here or in 4)
- Position 4: can be T or another letter
- Position 5: must be a letter not T (since T is not in 5) and not E (since E is in 2) and not A (in 3), and not the excluded letters.

Excluded letters: C, R, N, L, S.

T is present, so it must be in position 1 or 4.

We need to find a word that fits: ? E A ? ?

With T in position 1 or 4, and the last letter (position 5) is something else.

Also, the word must be 5 letters, English, and not use C, R, N, L, S.

Possible letters for position 1: if not T, then other consonants or vowels, but must be valid.

Since T is present and not in 5, and positions 2 and 3 are taken, T must be in 1 or 4.

Let's think of common words with pattern _ E A _ _

Options:

- If T in position 1: T E A _ _
  - Examples: ""TEARY"" but R is excluded -> invalid.
  - ""TEACH"" but C and H? C excluded, H possible? C is excluded, so no.
  - ""TEAMS"" but S excluded.
  - ""TEATS"" not common, and duplicate T? But T is only once? Not sure.
  - ""TEADE"" not a word.

- If T in position 4: _ E A T _
  - Examples: ""HEATH"" H,E,A,T,H? But duplicate H? Not necessarily, but ""HEATH"" is word, but position 5: H.
  - ""DEATH"" D,E,A,T,H? D and H possible.
  - ""NEATH"" but N excluded.
  - ""WEARY"" W,E,A,R,Y? R excluded.
  - ""PEATY"" not common.

From above, ""DEATH"" seems possible: D,E,A,T,H.

Letters: D, E, A, T, H.

Check against exclusions: C, R, N, L, S are excluded, but D and H are not excluded, so they are possible.

T is in position 4, which is allowed (since T not in 5, and here it's in 4).

Position 5 is H.

Another option: ""BEATS"" but we already used in previous? No, we used LEAST, but BEATS has S? S is excluded.

""MEATS"" S excluded.

""HEATS"" S excluded.

""YEATS"" proper noun? Not common.

""OCTET"" but pattern not match.

Another word: ""PEACE"" but C excluded and E at end? Pattern: P,E,A,C,E? C excluded and positions: P1,E2,A3,C4,E5? But E at 5? But we know E is at 2, so position 5 cannot be E? Actually, secret has E at 2, so position 5 is different.

But in ""PEACE"", C is excluded.

Not good.

""BEADY"" B,E,A,D,Y? Pattern B1,E2,A3,D4,Y5. T is not present? But we know T must be in the word.

From feedback, T is present (from LEAST, T(-) so T is in the word).

So any guess must include T.

In ""DEATH"", we have T at position 4.

Another word: ""DEALT"" but L excluded? L is excluded from LEAST feedback (L(x)).

LEAST had L at position 1, marked x, so L not in word.

Similarly, S not in word.

So ""DEALT"" has L, which is excluded.

Invalid.

""HEART"" H,E,A,R,T? R excluded.

Invalid.

""TEACH"" C excluded.

So back to ""DEATH"": D,E,A,T,H.

Positions: D1, E2, A3, T4, H5.

T is at position 4, which is fine (not 5).

H is at position 5.

We need to confirm if D and H are possible.

Since we have no information on D and H, it's a good test.

Another possibility: T in position 1.

But earlier options were limited.

""TEACH"" invalid.

""TEASE"" S excluded.

""TREAD"" R excluded.

""TEAKS"" not common, and S? S excluded.

""TEADE"" not word.

So ""DEATH"" seems a strong candidate.

But let's see if there are other words.

""MEATY"" M,E,A,T,Y? Pattern M1,E2,A3,T4,Y5. T at position 4, Y at 5.

M and Y not excluded.

Similarly, ""BEATY"" not common, usually ""beaty"" not standard.

""PEATY"" not common.

""WHEAT"" W,H,E,A,T? But positions: W1,H2,E3? But position 3 must be A, so W1,H2,E3,A4,T5? Not matching pattern; we need position 2=E, 3=A.

In ""WHEAT"", it's W-H-E-A-T, so P1=W, P2=H, P3=E, P4=A, P5=T? But we need P2=E and P3=A, so not matching.

Only words with P2=E and P3=A.

So ""DEATH"" and ""MEATY"" are options.

""MEATY"" is a word (adjective meaning of or like meat).

But ""DEATH"" is more common.

Also, ""HEAVE"" but V, and pattern H1,E2,A3? P3 not A, it's H1,E2,A3? ""HEAVE"" is H-E-A-V-E, so P1=H, P2=E, P3=A, P4=V, P5=E? But E at P5? And duplicate E? But secret has E at P2, so P5 cannot be E? Actually, it could be, but in feedback from CRANE, E was not at P5, but now we know E is at P2, so P5 can be different.

But in ""HEAVE"", P5 is E, which is the same letter, but position 5: if secret has only one E, then P5 cannot be E because E is at P2. But we don't know if secret has duplicate letters.

In previous feedback, no indication of duplicates, but possible.

To avoid complexity, assume no duplicates for now.

In CRANE, all distinct, and LEAST all distinct except A and T? L,E,A,S,T all distinct.

Similarly, secret might have distinct letters.

So assume distinct letters: secret has E at position 2, so no other E.

Therefore, position 5 cannot be E.

Similarly, in ""HEAVE"", P5=E, which would be invalid if secret has distinct letters.

Similarly, ""DEATH"" has distinct letters: D,E,A,T,H.

""MEATY"" M,E,A,T,Y distinct.

So both fine.

But ""MEATY"" is less common.

Another word: ""PEACH"" C excluded.

""BEACH"" C excluded.

""LEACH"" L and C excluded.

""REACH"" R excluded.

So ""DEATH"" is a good choice.

Perhaps ""WEALD"" but L excluded and pattern? W,E,A,L,D? L excluded.

No.

So I think ""DEATH"" is a reasonable guess.

In this guess, we have:
- Position 1: D (new)
- Position 2: E (correct, known)
- Position 3: A (correct, known)
- Position 4: T (we know T is present, testing position 4)
- Position 5: H (new)

If T is not in position 4, then it must be in position 1, but we don't have a candidate with T in position 1 that fits.

But we'll see from feedback.

Perhaps there is a word with T in position 1 and other letters.

For example, ""TEARY"" R excluded.

""TEACH"" C excluded.

""TEAMS"" S excluded.

""TEETH"" duplicate E.

Not possible with current constraints.

Therefore, T must be in position 4, so ""DEATH"" or similar.

So I'll go with ""DEATH"".

<thinking>
Consolidated Feedback:
- Position 2: E (confirmed correct)
- Position 3: A (confirmed correct)
- T is present but not in position 5 (so must be in position 1 or 4)
- Excluded letters: C, R, N, L, S

Secret word pattern: _ E A _ _

Since T must be in position 1 or 4, but words with T in position 1 are scarce due to exclusions (e.g., ""TEACH"" invalid), T is likely in position 4. Thus, pattern becomes _ E A T _

Possible words: ""DEATH"" (D1, E2, A3, T4, H5) or ""MEATY"" (M1, E2, A3, T4, Y5). ""DEATH"" is more common and uses high-frequency letters.

Chosen ""DEATH"" to test:
- D in position 1 (new)
- T in position 4 (to confirm if T is here)
- H in position 5 (new)
- If incorrect, it will help narrow down T's position and other letters.
</thinking>

<guess>DEATH</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C(absent), R(absent), A(correct position), N(absent), E(present but wrong position).  
  - This reveals:  
    - A is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 3.  
    - E is in the secret word but not at position 5.  
    - C, R, and N are absent from the secret word.  

- **Guess 2 (LEAST)**: L(absent), E(correct position), A(correct position), S(absent), T(present but wrong position).  
  - This reveals:  
    - E is correctly placed at position 2 (confirming it cannot be at position 1, 4, or 5).  
    - A is confirmed at position 3.  
    - T is in the secret word but not at position 5.  
    - L and S are absent from the secret word.  

### Key Insights:
- **Fixed positions**: Position 2 must be **E**, and position 3 must be **A**. The secret word pattern is: `_ E A _ _`.  
- **T's position**: T is present but not at position 5, so it must be at position 1 or 4.  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, L, and S are excluded.  
- **Unknown positions**: Positions 1, 4, and 5 need to be solved, with T occupying either position 1 or 4.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Test **T at position 4** (since T-in-position-1 options are limited by exclusions, e.g., ""TEACH"" is invalid due to C).  
- Use new high-frequency letters for positions 1 and 5 (e.g., D, H, M, Y) to maximize information.  
- **""DEATH""** fits perfectly:  
  - D (position 1), E (position 2, correct), A (position 3, correct), T (position 4, testing T's placement), H (position 5).  
  - It avoids all excluded letters and tests T in a plausible position.  
- If T is not at position 4, feedback will force T to position 1 in future guesses.  

<thinking>
- Position 2 is E (fixed).
- Position 3 is A (fixed).
- T must be in position 1 or 4 (since it can't be in 5).
- Excluded letters: C, R, N, L, S.
- ""DEATH"" tests T at position 4 and introduces D and H, which are common and untested.
- If T is correctly placed at position 4, we solve for positions 1 and 5. If not, T must be at position 1.
</thinking>

<guess>DEATH</guess>",DEATH,"We have feedback from two previous guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)
Meaning:
- A is correct and in position 3.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.
- C, R, N are not in the word.

Guess 2: LEAST -> L(x) E(✓) A(✓) S(x) T(-)
Meaning:
- E is correct and in position 2 (since it's marked ✓ for position 2 in LEAST).
- A is correct and in position 3 (as before, and confirmed again).
- T is in the word but not in position 5 (marked - for position 5).
- L and S are not in the word.

Now, combining the feedback:

1. Position 2 is E (from LEAST feedback: E(✓)).
2. Position 3 is A (confirmed in both).
3. E is in position 2, which satisfies the previous hint that E is in the word and not in position 5.
4. T is in the word but not in position 5. Since position 2 is E and position 3 is A, T must be in position 1 or 4 (since position 5 is not allowed for T per feedback).
5. Letters not in the word: C, R, N, L, S (from both guesses).

Also, from CRANE, E was not in position 5, but now we know it's in position 2.

Current knowns:
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: A
- T is present, but not in position 5 -> so must be in 1 or 4.

The secret word pattern: _ E A _ _

We need to fill positions 1, 4, and 5.

Constraints:
- Position 1: can be T or another letter (but T might be here or in 4)
- Position 4: can be T or another letter
- Position 5: must be a letter not T (since T is not in 5) and not E (since E is in 2) and not A (in 3), and not the excluded letters.

Excluded letters: C, R, N, L, S.

T is present, so it must be in position 1 or 4.

We need to find a word that fits: ? E A ? ?

With T in position 1 or 4, and the last letter (position 5) is something else.

Also, the word must be 5 letters, English, and not use C, R, N, L, S.

Possible letters for position 1: if not T, then other consonants or vowels, but must be valid.

Since T is present and not in 5, and positions 2 and 3 are taken, T must be in 1 or 4.

Let's think of common words with pattern _ E A _ _

Options:

- If T in position 1: T E A _ _
  - Examples: ""TEARY"" but R is excluded -> invalid.
  - ""TEACH"" but C and H? C excluded, H possible? C is excluded, so no.
  - ""TEAMS"" but S excluded.
  - ""TEATS"" not common, and duplicate T? But T is only once? Not sure.
  - ""TEADE"" not a word.

- If T in position 4: _ E A T _
  - Examples: ""HEATH"" H,E,A,T,H? But duplicate H? Not necessarily, but ""HEATH"" is word, but position 5: H.
  - ""DEATH"" D,E,A,T,H? D and H possible.
  - ""NEATH"" but N excluded.
  - ""WEARY"" W,E,A,R,Y? R excluded.
  - ""PEATY"" not common.

From above, ""DEATH"" seems possible: D,E,A,T,H.

Letters: D, E, A, T, H.

Check against exclusions: C, R, N, L, S are excluded, but D and H are not excluded, so they are possible.

T is in position 4, which is allowed (since T not in 5, and here it's in 4).

Position 5 is H.

Another option: ""BEATS"" but we already used in previous? No, we used LEAST, but BEATS has S? S is excluded.

""MEATS"" S excluded.

""HEATS"" S excluded.

""YEATS"" proper noun? Not common.

""OCTET"" but pattern not match.

Another word: ""PEACE"" but C excluded and E at end? Pattern: P,E,A,C,E? C excluded and positions: P1,E2,A3,C4,E5? But E at 5? But we know E is at 2, so position 5 cannot be E? Actually, secret has E at 2, so position 5 is different.

But in ""PEACE"", C is excluded.

Not good.

""BEADY"" B,E,A,D,Y? Pattern B1,E2,A3,D4,Y5. T is not present? But we know T must be in the word.

From feedback, T is present (from LEAST, T(-) so T is in the word).

So any guess must include T.

In ""DEATH"", we have T at position 4.

Another word: ""DEALT"" but L excluded? L is excluded from LEAST feedback (L(x)).

LEAST had L at position 1, marked x, so L not in word.

Similarly, S not in word.

So ""DEALT"" has L, which is excluded.

Invalid.

""HEART"" H,E,A,R,T? R excluded.

Invalid.

""TEACH"" C excluded.

So back to ""DEATH"": D,E,A,T,H.

Positions: D1, E2, A3, T4, H5.

T is at position 4, which is fine (not 5).

H is at position 5.

We need to confirm if D and H are possible.

Since we have no information on D and H, it's a good test.

Another possibility: T in position 1.

But earlier options were limited.

""TEACH"" invalid.

""TEASE"" S excluded.

""TREAD"" R excluded.

""TEAKS"" not common, and S? S excluded.

""TEADE"" not word.

So ""DEATH"" seems a strong candidate.

But let's see if there are other words.

""MEATY"" M,E,A,T,Y? Pattern M1,E2,A3,T4,Y5. T at position 4, Y at 5.

M and Y not excluded.

Similarly, ""BEATY"" not common, usually ""beaty"" not standard.

""PEATY"" not common.

""WHEAT"" W,H,E,A,T? But positions: W1,H2,E3? But position 3 must be A, so W1,H2,E3,A4,T5? Not matching pattern; we need position 2=E, 3=A.

In ""WHEAT"", it's W-H-E-A-T, so P1=W, P2=H, P3=E, P4=A, P5=T? But we need P2=E and P3=A, so not matching.

Only words with P2=E and P3=A.

So ""DEATH"" and ""MEATY"" are options.

""MEATY"" is a word (adjective meaning of or like meat).

But ""DEATH"" is more common.

Also, ""HEAVE"" but V, and pattern H1,E2,A3? P3 not A, it's H1,E2,A3? ""HEAVE"" is H-E-A-V-E, so P1=H, P2=E, P3=A, P4=V, P5=E? But E at P5? And duplicate E? But secret has E at P2, so P5 cannot be E? Actually, it could be, but in feedback from CRANE, E was not at P5, but now we know E is at P2, so P5 can be different.

But in ""HEAVE"", P5 is E, which is the same letter, but position 5: if secret has only one E, then P5 cannot be E because E is at P2. But we don't know if secret has duplicate letters.

In previous feedback, no indication of duplicates, but possible.

To avoid complexity, assume no duplicates for now.

In CRANE, all distinct, and LEAST all distinct except A and T? L,E,A,S,T all distinct.

Similarly, secret might have distinct letters.

So assume distinct letters: secret has E at position 2, so no other E.

Therefore, position 5 cannot be E.

Similarly, in ""HEAVE"", P5=E, which would be invalid if secret has distinct letters.

Similarly, ""DEATH"" has distinct letters: D,E,A,T,H.

""MEATY"" M,E,A,T,Y distinct.

So both fine.

But ""MEATY"" is less common.

Another word: ""PEACH"" C excluded.

""BEACH"" C excluded.

""LEACH"" L and C excluded.

""REACH"" R excluded.

So ""DEATH"" is a good choice.

Perhaps ""WEALD"" but L excluded and pattern? W,E,A,L,D? L excluded.

No.

So I think ""DEATH"" is a reasonable guess.

In this guess, we have:
- Position 1: D (new)
- Position 2: E (correct, known)
- Position 3: A (correct, known)
- Position 4: T (we know T is present, testing position 4)
- Position 5: H (new)

If T is not in position 4, then it must be in position 1, but we don't have a candidate with T in position 1 that fits.

But we'll see from feedback.

Perhaps there is a word with T in position 1 and other letters.

For example, ""TEARY"" R excluded.

""TEACH"" C excluded.

""TEAMS"" S excluded.

""TEETH"" duplicate E.

Not possible with current constraints.

Therefore, T must be in position 4, so ""DEATH"" or similar.

So I'll go with ""DEATH"".

<thinking>
Consolidated Feedback:
- Position 2: E (confirmed correct)
- Position 3: A (confirmed correct)
- T is present but not in position 5 (so must be in position 1 or 4)
- Excluded letters: C, R, N, L, S

Secret word pattern: _ E A _ _

Since T must be in position 1 or 4, but words with T in position 1 are scarce due to exclusions (e.g., ""TEACH"" invalid), T is likely in position 4. Thus, pattern becomes _ E A T _

Possible words: ""DEATH"" (D1, E2, A3, T4, H5) or ""MEATY"" (M1, E2, A3, T4, Y5). ""DEATH"" is more common and uses high-frequency letters.

Chosen ""DEATH"" to test:
- D in position 1 (new)
- T in position 4 (to confirm if T is here)
- H in position 5 (new)
- If incorrect, it will help narrow down T's position and other letters.
</thinking>

<guess>DEATH</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C(absent), R(absent), A(correct position), N(absent), E(present but wrong position).  
  - This reveals:  
    - A is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 3.  
    - E is in the secret word but not at position 5.  
    - C, R, and N are absent from the secret word.  

- **Guess 2 (LEAST)**: L(absent), E(correct position), A(correct position), S(absent), T(present but wrong position).  
  - This reveals:  
    - E is correctly placed at position 2 (confirming it cannot be at position 1, 4, or 5).  
    - A is confirmed at position 3.  
    - T is in the secret word but not at position 5.  
    - L and S are absent from the secret word.  

### Key Insights:
- **Fixed positions**: Position 2 must be **E**, and position 3 must be **A**. The secret word pattern is: `_ E A _ _`.  
- **T's position**: T is present but not at position 5, so it must be at position 1 or 4.  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, L, and S are excluded.  
- **Unknown positions**: Positions 1, 4, and 5 need to be solved, with T occupying either position 1 or 4.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Test **T at position 4** (since T-in-position-1 options are limited by exclusions, e.g., ""TEACH"" is invalid due to C).  
- Use new high-frequency letters for positions 1 and 5 (e.g., D, H, M, Y) to maximize information.  
- **""DEATH""** fits perfectly:  
  - D (position 1), E (position 2, correct), A (position 3, correct), T (position 4, testing T's placement), H (position 5).  
  - It avoids all excluded letters and tests T in a plausible position.  
- If T is not at position 4, feedback will force T to position 1 in future guesses.  

<thinking>
- Position 2 is E (fixed).
- Position 3 is A (fixed).
- T must be in position 1 or 4 (since it can't be in 5).
- Excluded letters: C, R, N, L, S.
- ""DEATH"" tests T at position 4 and introduces D and H, which are common and untested.
- If T is correctly placed at position 4, we solve for positions 1 and 5. If not, T must be at position 1.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>First, I need to make my first guess for the 5-letter word game. Since I have no prior feedback (it's the first guess), I should choose a word that maximizes the information I can get. That means picking a word with common letters and a good mix of vowels and consonants to cover possibilities.

Ideal first guesses in word games like Wordle often include words that use frequent letters. For example, words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ROAST"" are popular because they contain common letters.

Let me think about common letters in English words. According to letter frequency, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. So, I should include several of these in my guess.

I need a 5-letter word that uses different letters to avoid redundancy. For instance, ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E – all high-frequency letters. Similarly, ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E.

Another good one is ""ADIEU"" because it has three vowels (A, I, E, U – but U is less common), but it might not be optimal. Better to have a balance.

Since this is the first guess, I should aim for a word that's likely to be actual answers but also informative. But I don't know the secret word, so I just need a good starter.

I recall that ""SALET"" or ""CRATE"" are often recommended. Let's pick ""CRANE"" as a solid choice.

Now, for the response format: I need to think step by step, but since this is the first guess, there's nothing to deduce yet. So my reasoning is straightforward.

Later guesses will use feedback to refine.

So for now, I'll go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess.

Finally, I need to output my thought process within <thinking> tags, then the guess in <guess> tags.

Let me outline:

<thinking>
Since this is the first guess, I have no prior information. I should choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the chances of getting useful feedback. Letters like A, E, R, S, T, N, L, etc. are frequently used in English words. After considering options, ""CRANE"" is a good choice because it has C, R, A, N, E – all high-frequency letters. This will help identify which positions might be correct and which letters are in the word more efficiently.
</thinking>

Then:

<guess> crane </guess>

In the game rules, it says to use uppercase or lowercase? The example uses uppercase like ""STORM"", but in response, it might not matter. I'll use lowercase for consistency, but the problem doesn't specify. In the feedback example, it's uppercase, but for my output, I can do lowercase.

To match, perhaps I should use uppercase like the example. Let me check: ""Secret Word: BRISK"" and ""Guess 1: STORM"" are uppercase. So I should use uppercase for my guess.

Similarly, in my response, I'll use uppercase.

So, <guess> CRANE </guess>

But in the response format, it says ""guessed-word"" so it could be lowercase. However, to be consistent with the problem statement, I'll use uppercase.

Actually, in the response format: ""return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>."" It says ""guessed-word"" which might imply the word itself, not the case. But to avoid confusion, I'll use uppercase as in the examples.

Final decision: output CRANE in uppercase.<thinking>
Since this is the first guess with no prior feedback, I need to select a word that maximizes information gain. I should choose a word with high-frequency letters in English to increase the likelihood of hitting correct letters, vowels, or consonants. Based on common averages, letters like A, E, R, S, T, N, L, and C appear frequently in 5-letter words. After considering options like ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", and ""CRATE"", I chose ""CRANE"" because it contains five distinct high-frequency letters (C, R, A, N, E), which is optimal for covering vowel and consonant possibilities. This will help me interpret the feedback efficiently for subsequent guesses.

Guess 2: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>Hmm, the user just gave me feedback on my first guess of ""CRANE"". The feedback is C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(-). This means:

- C is not in the secret word at all
- R is not in the secret word 
- A is correct and in the right position (position 3)
- N is not in the word
- E is in the word but not in position 4

Since A is correct at position 3, the secret word has A as its third letter. E is present but not in fourth position. So E must be either in position 1,2 or 5.

Now C,R,N are eliminated - they can't be in the word. 

For my next guess, I need to:
- Keep A in position 3
- Include E but not in position 4
- Avoid C,R,N
- Use other common letters to test possibilities

The word has to be 5 letters. With A fixed at position 3, and E somewhere else.

Possible positions for E: 1,2,5. Not 3 (occupied by A) or 4 (wrong position per feedback).

Common English words fitting this:
- Must have _ _ A _ _ structure
- Contains E not at end if position 4? No, E cannot be in position 4

Brainstorm words: 
- Like ""BEADS"" - B,E,A,D,S. Has E in position 2? 
- Or ""LEAST"" - L,E,A,S,T. Position 2
- Or ""OCEAN"" but N is invalid (was x)
Avoid N

Better options:
- ""STEAD"" - S,T,E,A,D? Positions: S1,T2,E3? But position 3 is A, conflict
Must have E not in position 4 and A in 3.

So: position 1,2,5 can have E? Examples:
- ""MEALY"" - M1,E2,A3,L4,Y5. But E position 2? Feedback said E in word but not position 4 - position 2 should be ok.
Problem: letters must match.

Other words: 
- ""SPEAK"" - S1,P2,E3? But E cannot be in position 3 because that's A's position? Positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:E? Feedback says A is ✓ in position 3, so third letter must be A, so ""SPEAK"" has E in position 3? No: S-P-E-A-K? Positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:E, 4:A, 5:K - so position 3 is E? But we need A at position 3. Not matching.

We need _ _ A _ _ with A fixed at position 3.

And E must be in 1,2,4,5 but cannot be in 4 per feedback? Feedback: E(-) meaning wrong position, so E is not 5? Wait, in guess ""CRANE"" E was position 5, and it's marked ""-"" meaning present but wrong position? Exactly: in ""CRANE"", positions: C1,R2,A3,N4,E5. Feedback C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(-). So E is at position 5 and it's not correct position, so E could be elsewhere.

E cannot be in position 5? No: ""-"" means it's in the word but not in that position, so E is in the word but not position 5? Or could it be that position 5 is wrong, but E might be elsewhere?

Feedback symbol: ""-"" means letter is in word but wrong position.

For E: in position 5, but it's not correct position, meaning E might be in position 1,2,3,4? But position 3 is A, so E cannot be position 3. Position 4 we know from guess A is position 3, N in position 4? But N is not present.

Secret word: position 3 is A. Position 4 cannot be E because E is present and not at position 5? But position 4 could potentially have E?

Let's clarify: E is marked as ""-"" from position 5, meaning E is in the word but not position 5. So in secret word, E is at some other position: 1,2,3, or 4. But position 3 is taken by A, so E cannot be position 3. Position 4 is not occupied? Secret position 4 could be E? But E could be in position 1,2 or 4.

Forbidden: position 5 for E? Effectively, E must be in positions 1,2, or 4 of the secret word.

But in ""CRANE"", position 4 is N, and N is absent. So secret position 4 is unknown.

So E must be at position 1,2, or 4.

In next guess, I should try to cover multiple possibilities.

Also, C,R,N are excluded.

Good letters to try: S,T,L,O,D,I,B etc.

Words fitting _ _ A _ _ :

- With E in position 1: e.g., ""EAGLE"" but E in 1, A in 3? Positions: E1,A2,G3,L4,E5? Not A at 3?

Better:  _ _ A _ _ position: let positions be P1, P2, P3=A, P4, P5.

E can be P1, P2, or P4.

Possibilities:

If E at P1: words like E?A??
- ""ELAND"" but L and D? And N invalid? N is excluded.
Avoid N, C, R.

""ELAPS""? Not word.

""EVADE"" - E1,V2,A3,D4,E5? But D4, E5? But E at P5 is possible? But E is also at P1? In ""EVADE"", E is P1 and P5, which might be confusing, but secret may have E only once? Not specified, words can have duplicate letters, but Wordle usually no duplicates? Game rules not specified, assume words can have duplicates? Typically Wordle allows duplicates, but feedback might be tricky.

Check rules: ""each letter in your guess"" but no mention of duplicate letters. So possible.

But to simplify, assume distinct letters first? Not sure.

In feedback, for duplicates, it's handled specially.

But since previous guess ""CRANE"" all distinct letters, and no feedback indicating duplicates, I'll assume distinct letters for simplicity.

So secret word has distinct letters? Or not. Feedback doesn't show any, so probably safe to assume distinct for now.

Letters must be distinct except if word allows.

""EVADE"" has two E's.

Messy.

Simpler: try for common words.

Options:
- E as P1: words like ""ELATE"" - E1,L2,A3,T4,E5? Positions: E? No, ""ELATE"" E-L-A-T-E P1,L2,A3,T4,E5. So P3=A, P4=T can be anything.

But N invalid? ""ELATE"" has E,L,A,T,E - T in P4.

Feedback was E marked ""-"" for position 5 in ""CRANE"", but in ""ELATE"", E at P5? But E could be correct if present elsewhere.

I should pick a word with E in a new position and test P4 possibilities.

Since E must be at position 1,2, or 4, and not 5.

In next guess, put E at position 1 or 2 or 4 to see.

Also, include other common letters.

For example, put E at position 2: word format _ E A _ _
- Like ""LEAST"" - L,E,A,S,T? P1:L, P2:E, P3:A, P4:S, P5:T. This has E at P2.

""LEAST"" letters L,E,A,S,T. But A is already confirmed, so testing S,T,L.

C,R,N not included.

If E at P4: word like ? ? A E ? But positions P3=A, P4=E, so ? ? A E ? - like ""CHASE"" but C invalid? ""SHADE"" S,H,A,D,E? P1:S, P2:H, P3:A, P4:D, P5:E - E at P5? But E cannot be P5? No, this has E at P5.

""PLACE"" P invalid? P,L,A,C,E? C invalid.

""GRACE"" G,R,A,C,E? R and C invalid.

Hard to find with E at P4.

Better to try E at position 2.

""LEAST"" seems solid: common word, letters L,S,T are good testers.

""STEAL"" - S,T,E,A,L? Positions S1,T2,E3? P3 must be A, but here P3=E? No: S-T-E-A-L -> P1:S,P2:T,P3:E? But P3 must be A for secret, so conflict.

""PLEAT"" P,L,E,A,T? P1:P,P2:L,P3:E,P4:A? But P3 must be A? No, P4=A? Wrong position.

Words with P3=A: ""BEATS"" B,E,A,T,S? P1:B,P2:E,P3:A,P4:T,P5:S. E at position 2.

Similarly, ""YEARN"" but P2:E,P3:A, but Y and R,N? R and N invalid.

Avoid R,N,C.

So ""BEATS"" or ""MEALS"" M,E,A,L,S? P2:E.

""BEATS"" seems fine: B,E,A,T,S.

But E at P2? Yes.

""MEANS"" M,E,A,N,S? But N invalid.

""LEAPS"" L,E,A,P,S? P invalid? P is ok.

""HEADS"" H,E,A,D,S? D ok.

Now, choose between e.g. ""LEAST"", ""BEATS"", etc.

""LEAST"" has L,E,A,S,T - all good letters except A already known.

Perhaps ""SLATE"" S,L,A,T,E? But E at P5? Cannot have E at P5 per previous feedback? P5:E marked ""-"" meaning E not at P5, but it's in word, so in secret, E is not P5, so for guess, I can put E elsewhere.

In ""SLATE"", positions: S1,L2,A3,T4,E5? So E at P5 again? But feedback said E is not at P5, secret E is elsewhere, so guessing E at P5 again might not be helpful; better to put E at a different position to test.

In next guess, I should put E not at position 5, and preferably at position 1,2 or 4 to confirm where it is.

For example, put E at position 1: like ""EAGER"" but R invalid? ""EARLY"" E,A,R,L,Y? But A at P2? Not P3; P3 must be A.

Hard.

""EATER"" E,A,T,E,R? Duplicate E and R invalid.

""ELATE"" E,l,a,t,e? duplicate E.

""EDEMA"" not common.

Perhaps ""SUAVE"" S,U,A,V,E? P1:S,P2:U,P3:A,P4:V,P5:E? But E at P5? Same problem.

Put E at position 4.

Word like ? ? A E ?

For example, ""PLANE"" but N invalid? P,L,A,N,E? N.

""GRADE"" G,R,A,D,E? R invalid.

""SHALE"" S,H,A,L,E? P1:S,P2:H,P3:A,P4:L,P P5:E? E at P5 again.

Positions: to have E at P4, word P1, P2, P3=A, P4=E, P5=?

For example, ""SAWED"" S,A,W,E,D? But P2:H? No: S1,A2? Position conflict: P3 must be A, so P1 and P2 are sth else, P3=A, P4=E, P5=?

""AISLE"" A,I,S,L,E? But P1:A, P2:I, but P3=S? Not A.

""CAUSE"" C1,A2,U3,S4,E5? P3 not A.

Words like ""CHASE"" C,H,A,S,E? P1:C (invalid), P2:H, P3:A? Almost: C-H-A-S-E P1:C,P2:H,P3:A,P4:S,P5:E? P4=S, P5=E.

But E at P5? Same as before.

Difficult to find 5-letter word with P3=A and P4=E, and distinct letters.

Example: ""IRATE"" I,R,A,T,E? P1:I, P2:R (invalid), P3:A? P4:T, P5:E? E at P5.

""STAGE"" S,T,A,G,E? P1:S,P2:T,P3:A,P4:G,P5:E? E at P5.

Always E at end? Not necessarily.

""BASED"" B,A,S,E,D? But P3 not A: P1:B,P2:A,P3:S? Conflict.

Only if word has A at position 3, E at position 4: ""CHAFE"" C,H,A,F,E? P1:C,P2:H,P3:A,P4:F,P5:E? E at P5.

I think for common words, E at P4 requires P5 not E, but ending.

Perhaps ""ARISE"" but P3=I? No.

Give up on P4 for now.

So to test E position, put E at position 2 in next guess.

Choose a word like ""LEAST"": L,E,A,S,T.

Positions: L1,E2,A3,S4,T5

Here, E at position 2, which is possible per feedback.

Also, S and T are good letters to test.

If feedback shows E not at position 2, then E must be at position 1 or 4.

Similarly, other letters can give clues.

Another option: ""STEAD"" - but positions S1,T2,E3,A4,D5? But P3 must be A? Position conflict: P3=E not A.

Not good.

Or ""BEAST"" B,E,A,S,T? P1:B,P2:E,P3:A,P4:S,P5:T. Same as ""BEATS"" but different order.

""BEATS"" P4:T,P5:S vs ""BEAST"" P4:S,P5:T? Actually ""BEATS"" is word? Yes, ""beats"".

Both fine.

I'll go with ""LEAST"".

Letters: L,E,A,S,T - covers several consonants.

And A is at its correct position.

Now for output.Based on the feedback from Guess 1 (""CRANE""):  
- C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(-)  

This indicates:  
1. A is correct and in position 3 (since it's marked ✓).  
2. E is in the secret word but not in position 5 (since E is marked -).  
3. C, R, and N are not in the secret word (all marked x).  

Constraints for the next guess:  
- Position 3 must be A.  
- E must be in the word but not position 5, so it must appear in positions 1, 2, or 4.  
- Avoid C, R, and N.  

To maximize information, I should:  
- Keep A in position 3 (required).  
- Test E in a new position to pinpoint its location—ideally position 2 or 4, as position 5 is invalid. Position 1 was less tested in the previous guess.  
- Include other high-frequency letters not yet tested (like S, T, L, D) to cover more possibilities.  

Good candidate words:  
- ""LEAST"": Tests E in position 2, with S and T as new consonants. Fits letter constraints (no C, R, N).  
- ""BEATS"": Also tests E in position 2, but B is less common than L.  
- ""STAND"": Avoided due to N (ineligible).  

I chose ""LEAST"" (L1, E2, A3, S4, T5):  
- Efficiently tests potential E positions while using common letters.  
- If E is misplaced here, it narrows E to position 1 or 4.  
- Tests S and T for presence/position.

<thinking>
Feedback Analysis:
- Secret has A in position 3: confirmed ✓ from previous guess.
5. E is in the word but not in position 5: must be in position 1, 2, or 4 of the secret word.
- Letters C, R, N are absent from the secret word.
Next Guess Strategy:
- Position 3 must be A.
- E should be placed in a new plausible position (2) to reduce uncertainty (not retesting position 5).
- Avoid using C, R, or N.
- Include new high-frequency consonants like S, T, L to gather more letter clues.
Selected ""LEAST"" because:
  - Positions: L1, E2, A3, S4, T5.
  - Tests E at position 2 (possible based on feedback).
  - Adds common letters S and T to check for presence.
  - Word avoids invalid letters and fits common words list.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: tags.

Let me outline:

<thinking>
Since this is the first guess, I have no prior information. I should choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the chances of getting useful feedback. Letters like A, E, R, S, T, N, L, etc. are frequently used in English words. After considering options, ""CRANE"" is a good choice because it has C, R, A, N, E – all high-frequency letters. This will help identify which positions might be correct and which letters are in the word more efficiently.
</thinking>

Then:

<guess> crane -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
Guess 2: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)
Guess 3: LEAST -> FEEDBACK: L(x) E(✓) A(✓) S(x) T(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two previous guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)
Meaning:
- A is correct and in position 3.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.
- C, R, N are not in the word.

Guess 2: LEAST -> L(x) E(✓) A(✓) S(x) T(-)
Meaning:
- E is correct and in position 2 (since it's marked ✓ for position 2 in LEAST).
- A is correct and in position 3 (as before, and confirmed again).
- T is in the word but not in position 5 (marked - for position 5).
- L and S are not in the word.

Now, combining the feedback:

1. Position 2 is E (from LEAST feedback: E(✓)).
2. Position 3 is A (confirmed in both).
3. E is in position 2, which satisfies the previous hint that E is in the word and not in position 5.
4. T is in the word but not in position 5. Since position 2 is E and position 3 is A, T must be in position 1 or 4 (since position 5 is not allowed for T per feedback).
5. Letters not in the word: C, R, N, L, S (from both guesses).

Also, from CRANE, E was not in position 5, but now we know it's in position 2.

Current knowns:
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: A
- T is present, but not in position 5 -> so must be in 1 or 4.

The secret word pattern: _ E A _ _

We need to fill positions 1, 4, and 5.

Constraints:
- Position 1: can be T or another letter (but T might be here or in 4)
- Position 4: can be T or another letter
- Position 5: must be a letter not T (since T is not in 5) and not E (since E is in 2) and not A (in 3), and not the excluded letters.

Excluded letters: C, R, N, L, S.

T is present, so it must be in position 1 or 4.

We need to find a word that fits: ? E A ? ?

With T in position 1 or 4, and the last letter (position 5) is something else.

Also, the word must be 5 letters, English, and not use C, R, N, L, S.

Possible letters for position 1: if not T, then other consonants or vowels, but must be valid.

Since T is present and not in 5, and positions 2 and 3 are taken, T must be in 1 or 4.

Let's think of common words with pattern _ E A _ _

Options:

- If T in position 1: T E A _ _
  - Examples: ""TEARY"" but R is excluded -> invalid.
  - ""TEACH"" but C and H? C excluded, H possible? C is excluded, so no.
  - ""TEAMS"" but S excluded.
  - ""TEATS"" not common, and duplicate T? But T is only once? Not sure.
  - ""TEADE"" not a word.

- If T in position 4: _ E A T _
  - Examples: ""HEATH"" H,E,A,T,H? But duplicate H? Not necessarily, but ""HEATH"" is word, but position 5: H.
  - ""DEATH"" D,E,A,T,H? D and H possible.
  - ""NEATH"" but N excluded.
  - ""WEARY"" W,E,A,R,Y? R excluded.
  - ""PEATY"" not common.

From above, ""DEATH"" seems possible: D,E,A,T,H.

Letters: D, E, A, T, H.

Check against exclusions: C, R, N, L, S are excluded, but D and H are not excluded, so they are possible.

T is in position 4, which is allowed (since T not in 5, and here it's in 4).

Position 5 is H.

Another option: ""BEATS"" but we already used in previous? No, we used LEAST, but BEATS has S? S is excluded.

""MEATS"" S excluded.

""HEATS"" S excluded.

""YEATS"" proper noun? Not common.

""OCTET"" but pattern not match.

Another word: ""PEACE"" but C excluded and E at end? Pattern: P,E,A,C,E? C excluded and positions: P1,E2,A3,C4,E5? But E at 5? But we know E is at 2, so position 5 cannot be E? Actually, secret has E at 2, so position 5 is different.

But in ""PEACE"", C is excluded.

Not good.

""BEADY"" B,E,A,D,Y? Pattern B1,E2,A3,D4,Y5. T is not present? But we know T must be in the word.

From feedback, T is present (from LEAST, T(-) so T is in the word).

So any guess must include T.

In ""DEATH"", we have T at position 4.

Another word: ""DEALT"" but L excluded? L is excluded from LEAST feedback (L(x)).

LEAST had L at position 1, marked x, so L not in word.

Similarly, S not in word.

So ""DEALT"" has L, which is excluded.

Invalid.

""HEART"" H,E,A,R,T? R excluded.

Invalid.

""TEACH"" C excluded.

So back to ""DEATH"": D,E,A,T,H.

Positions: D1, E2, A3, T4, H5.

T is at position 4, which is fine (not 5).

H is at position 5.

We need to confirm if D and H are possible.

Since we have no information on D and H, it's a good test.

Another possibility: T in position 1.

But earlier options were limited.

""TEACH"" invalid.

""TEASE"" S excluded.

""TREAD"" R excluded.

""TEAKS"" not common, and S? S excluded.

""TEADE"" not word.

So ""DEATH"" seems a strong candidate.

But let's see if there are other words.

""MEATY"" M,E,A,T,Y? Pattern M1,E2,A3,T4,Y5. T at position 4, Y at 5.

M and Y not excluded.

Similarly, ""BEATY"" not common, usually ""beaty"" not standard.

""PEATY"" not common.

""WHEAT"" W,H,E,A,T? But positions: W1,H2,E3? But position 3 must be A, so W1,H2,E3,A4,T5? Not matching pattern; we need position 2=E, 3=A.

In ""WHEAT"", it's W-H-E-A-T, so P1=W, P2=H, P3=E, P4=A, P5=T? But we need P2=E and P3=A, so not matching.

Only words with P2=E and P3=A.

So ""DEATH"" and ""MEATY"" are options.

""MEATY"" is a word (adjective meaning of or like meat).

But ""DEATH"" is more common.

Also, ""HEAVE"" but V, and pattern H1,E2,A3? P3 not A, it's H1,E2,A3? ""HEAVE"" is H-E-A-V-E, so P1=H, P2=E, P3=A, P4=V, P5=E? But E at P5? And duplicate E? But secret has E at P2, so P5 cannot be E? Actually, it could be, but in feedback from CRANE, E was not at P5, but now we know E is at P2, so P5 can be different.

But in ""HEAVE"", P5 is E, which is the same letter, but position 5: if secret has only one E, then P5 cannot be E because E is at P2. But we don't know if secret has duplicate letters.

In previous feedback, no indication of duplicates, but possible.

To avoid complexity, assume no duplicates for now.

In CRANE, all distinct, and LEAST all distinct except A and T? L,E,A,S,T all distinct.

Similarly, secret might have distinct letters.

So assume distinct letters: secret has E at position 2, so no other E.

Therefore, position 5 cannot be E.

Similarly, in ""HEAVE"", P5=E, which would be invalid if secret has distinct letters.

Similarly, ""DEATH"" has distinct letters: D,E,A,T,H.

""MEATY"" M,E,A,T,Y distinct.

So both fine.

But ""MEATY"" is less common.

Another word: ""PEACH"" C excluded.

""BEACH"" C excluded.

""LEACH"" L and C excluded.

""REACH"" R excluded.

So ""DEATH"" is a good choice.

Perhaps ""WEALD"" but L excluded and pattern? W,E,A,L,D? L excluded.

No.

So I think ""DEATH"" is a reasonable guess.

In this guess, we have:
- Position 1: D (new)
- Position 2: E (correct, known)
- Position 3: A (correct, known)
- Position 4: T (we know T is present, testing position 4)
- Position 5: H (new)

If T is not in position 4, then it must be in position 1, but we don't have a candidate with T in position 1 that fits.

But we'll see from feedback.

Perhaps there is a word with T in position 1 and other letters.

For example, ""TEARY"" R excluded.

""TEACH"" C excluded.

""TEAMS"" S excluded.

""TEETH"" duplicate E.

Not possible with current constraints.

Therefore, T must be in position 4, so ""DEATH"" or similar.

So I'll go with ""DEATH"".

<thinking>
Consolidated Feedback:
- Position 2: E (confirmed correct)
- Position 3: A (confirmed correct)
- T is present but not in position 5 (so must be in position 1 or 4)
- Excluded letters: C, R, N, L, S

Secret word pattern: _ E A _ _

Since T must be in position 1 or 4, but words with T in position 1 are scarce due to exclusions (e.g., ""TEACH"" invalid), T is likely in position 4. Thus, pattern becomes _ E A T _

Possible words: ""DEATH"" (D1, E2, A3, T4, H5) or ""MEATY"" (M1, E2, A3, T4, Y5). ""DEATH"" is more common and uses high-frequency letters.

Chosen ""DEATH"" to test:
- D in position 1 (new)
- T in position 4 (to confirm if T is here)
- H in position 5 (new)
- If incorrect, it will help narrow down T's position and other letters.
</thinking>

<guess>DEATH</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C(absent), R(absent), A(correct position), N(absent), E(present but wrong position).  
  - This reveals:  
    - A is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 3.  
    - E is in the secret word but not at position 5.  
    - C, R, and N are absent from the secret word.  

- **Guess 2 (LEAST)**: L(absent), E(correct position), A(correct position), S(absent), T(present but wrong position).  
  - This reveals:  
    - E is correctly placed at position 2 (confirming it cannot be at position 1, 4, or 5).  
    - A is confirmed at position 3.  
    - T is in the secret word but not at position 5.  
    - L and S are absent from the secret word.  

### Key Insights:
- **Fixed positions**: Position 2 must be **E**, and position 3 must be **A**. The secret word pattern is: `_ E A _ _`.  
- **T's position**: T is present but not at position 5, so it must be at position 1 or 4.  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, L, and S are excluded.  
- **Unknown positions**: Positions 1, 4, and 5 need to be solved, with T occupying either position 1 or 4.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Test **T at position 4** (since T-in-position-1 options are limited by exclusions, e.g., ""TEACH"" is invalid due to C).  
- Use new high-frequency letters for positions 1 and 5 (e.g., D, H, M, Y) to maximize information.  
- **""DEATH""** fits perfectly:  
  - D (position 1), E (position 2, correct), A (position 3, correct), T (position 4, testing T's placement), H (position 5).  
  - It avoids all excluded letters and tests T in a plausible position.  
- If T is not at position 4, feedback will force T to position 1 in future guesses.  

<thinking>
- Position 2 is E (fixed).
- Position 3 is A (fixed).
- T must be in position 1 or 4 (since it can't be in 5).
- Excluded letters: C, R, N, L, S.
- ""DEATH"" tests T at position 4 and introduces D and H, which are common and untested.
- If T is correctly placed at position 4, we solve for positions 1 and 5. If not, T must be at position 1.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: tags.

Let me outline:

<thinking>
Since this is the first guess, I have no prior information. I should choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the chances of getting useful feedback. Letters like A, E, R, S, T, N, L, etc. are frequently used in English words. After considering options, ""CRANE"" is a good choice because it has C, R, A, N, E – all high-frequency letters. This will help identify which positions might be correct and which letters are in the word more efficiently.

Since I have no prior feedback (it\'s the first guess), I should choose a word that maximizes the information I can get. That means picking a word with common letters and a good mix of vowels and consonants to cover possibilities.\n\nIdeal first guesses in word games like Wordle often include words that use frequent letters. For example, words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ROAST"" are popular because they contain common letters.\n\nLet me think about common letters in English words. According to letter frequency, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. So, I should include several of these in my guess.\n\nI need a 5-letter word that uses different letters to avoid redundancy. For instance, ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E – all high-frequency letters. Similarly, ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E.\n\nAnother good one is ""ADIEU"" because it has three vowels (A, I, E, U – but U is less common), but it might not be optimal. Better to have a balance.\n\nSince this is the first guess, I should aim for a word that\'s likely to be actual answers but also informative. But I don\'t know the secret word, so I just need a good starter.\n\nI recall that ""SALET"" or ""CRATE"" are often recommended.

Positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:E, 4:A, 5:K - so position 3 is E? But we need A at position 3.

Position 4 cannot be E because E is present and not at position 5? But position 4 could potentially have E?\n\nLet\'s clarify: E is marked as ""-"" from position 5, meaning E is in the word but not position 5. So in secret word, E is at some other position: 1,2,3, or 4. But position 3 is taken by A, so E cannot be position 3. Position 4 is not occupied? Secret position 4 could be E? But E could be in position 1,2 or 4.\n\nForbidden: position 5 for E? Effectively, E must be in positions 1,2, or 4 of the secret word.\n\nBut in ""CRANE"", position 4 is N, and N is absent.

In ""EVADE"", E is P1 and P5, which might be confusing, but secret may have E only once? Not specified, words can have duplicate letters, but Wordle usually no duplicates? Game rules not specified, assume words can have duplicates? Typically Wordle allows duplicates, but feedback might be tricky.\n\nCheck rules: ""each letter in your guess"" but no mention of duplicate letters. So possible.\n\nBut to simplify, assume distinct letters first? Not sure.\n\nIn feedback, for duplicates, it\'s handled specially.\n\nBut since previous guess ""CRANE"" all distinct letters, and no feedback indicating duplicates, I\'ll assume distinct letters for simplicity.\n\nSo secret word has distinct letters? Or not. Feedback doesn\'t show any, so probably safe to assume distinct for now.\n\nLetters must be distinct except if word allows.\n\n""EVADE"" has two E\'s.\n\nMessy.\n\nSimpler: try for common words.\n\nOptions:\n- E as P1: words like ""ELATE"" - E1,L2,A3,T4,E5?

But E could be correct if present elsewhere.\n\nI should pick a word with E in a new position and test P4 possibilities.\n\nSince E must be at position 1,2, or 4, and not 5.\n\nIn next guess, put E at position 1 or 2 or 4 to see.\n\nAlso, include other common letters.\n\nFor example, put E at position 2: word format _ E A _ _\n- Like ""LEAST"" - L,E,A,S,T? P1:L, P2:E, P3:A, P4:S, P5:T. This has E at P2.\n\n""LEAST"" letters L,E,A,S,T. But A is already confirmed, so testing S,T,L.\n\nC,R,N not included.\n\nIf E at P4: word like ? ? A E ? But positions P3=A, P4=E, so ? ? A E ? - like ""CHASE"" but C invalid? ""SHADE"" S,H,A,D,E? P1:S, P2:H, P3:A, P4:D, P5:E - E at P5? But E cannot be P5? No, this has E at P5.\n\n""PLACE"" P invalid?

C, R, and N are not in the secret word (all marked x).  \n\nConstraints for the next guess:  \n- Position 3 must be A.  \n- E must be in the word but not position 5, so it must appear in positions 1, 2, or 4.  \n- Avoid C, R, and N.  \n\nTo maximize information, I should:  \n- Keep A in position 3 (required).  \n- Test E in a new position to pinpoint its location—ideally position 2 or 4, as position 5 is invalid. Position 1 was less tested in the previous guess.  \n- Include other high-frequency letters not yet tested (like S, T, L, D) to cover more possibilities.  \n\nGood candidate words:  \n- ""LEAST"": Tests E in position 2, with S and T as new consonants. Fits letter constraints (no C, R, N).  \n- ""BEATS"": Also tests E in position 2, but B is less common than L.  \n- ""STAND"": Avoided due to N (ineligible).  \n\nI chose ""LEAST"" (L1, E2, A3, S4, T5):  \n- Efficiently tests potential E positions while using common letters.  \n- If E is misplaced here, it narrows E to position 1 or 4.  \n- Tests S and T for presence/position.\n\n<thinking>\nFeedback Analysis:\n- Secret has A in position 3: confirmed ✓ from previous guess.\n5.

Actually, it could be, but in feedback from CRANE, E was not at P5, but now we know E is at P2, so P5 can be different.\n\nBut in ""HEAVE"", P5 is E, which is the same letter, but position 5: if secret has only one E, then P5 cannot be E because E is at P2. But we don\'t know if secret has duplicate letters.\n\nIn previous feedback, no indication of duplicates, but possible.\n\nTo avoid complexity, assume no duplicates for now.\n\nIn CRANE, all distinct, and LEAST all distinct except A and T? L,E,A,S,T all distinct.\n\nSimilarly, secret might have distinct letters.\n\nSo assume distinct letters: secret has E at position 2, so no other E.\n\nTherefore, position 5 cannot be E.\n\nSimilarly, in ""HEAVE"", P5=E, which would be invalid if secret has distinct letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""DEATH"" has distinct letters: D,E,A,T,H.\n\n""MEATY"" M,E,A,T,Y distinct.\n\nSo both fine.\n\nBut ""MEATY"" is less common.\n\nAnother word: ""PEACH"" C excluded.\n\n""BEACH"" C excluded.\n\n""LEACH"" L and C excluded.\n\n""REACH"" R excluded.\n\nSo ""DEATH"" is a good choice.\n\nPerhaps ""WEALD"" but L excluded and pattern?

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)
Meaning:
- A is correct and in position 3.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.
- C, R, N are not in the word.

Guess 2: LEAST -> L(x) E(✓) A(✓) S(x) T(-)
Meaning:
- E is correct and in position 2 (so position 2 is E).
- A is correct and in position 3 (confirmed).
- T is in the word but not in position 5.
- L and S are not in the word.

Guess 3: DEATH -> D(x) E(✓) A(✓) T(✓) H(✓)
Meaning:
- E is correct in position 2 (already known).
- A is correct in position 3 (known).
- T is correct in position 4 (so position 4 is T).
- H is correct in position 5 (so position 5 is H).
- D is not in the word.

Now, combining all feedback:

- Position 2: E (fixed)
- Position 3: A (fixed)
- Position 4: T (fixed)
- Position 5: H (fixed)
- Position 1: Unknown, but we know it cannot be D, C, R, N, L, S (from previous exclusions).

Also, from the first guess, E was not in position 5 (but now we know position 5 is H, so that's consistent). T was not in position 5 (now we know it's in position 4).

The secret word is now: ? E A T H

We only need to find the first letter.

Excluded letters: C, R, N, L, S, D (from the x's in the feedback).

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

Possible letters for position 1: any letter not excluded and not already in the word (assuming no duplicates, as there's no indication of duplicates so far).

The word has E, A, T, H. So position 1 cannot be any of these? Not necessarily, but since they are already placed, and no feedback suggests duplicates, we assume distinct letters.

So position 1 must be a letter not in {E, A, T, H} and not in the excluded set {C, R, N, L, S, D}.

Common letters left: B, F, G, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word ending with ""EATH"" but with the first letter not excluded.

Common words: 
- ""HEATH"" but H is already at position 5? ""HEATH"" would be H,E,A,T,H? But that has H at position 1 and 5, duplicate. But in our pattern, position 1 is unknown, position 5 is H. So if position 1 is H, then duplicate H? But feedback hasn't indicated duplicates, so maybe not.

In previous guesses, all letters were distinct, so likely secret has distinct letters.

Therefore, position 1 cannot be H (since H is at 5), cannot be E (at 2), A (at 3), T (at 4).

So must be a different letter.

Words like ""NEATH"" but N is excluded.

""LEATH"" not a word.

""YEATH"" not a word.

""MEATH"" not common, but ""meath"" is not standard.

Common word: ""WREATH"" but W,R,E,A,T,H? 6 letters? No, 6 letters.

5-letter words ending with EATH: 

- ""HEATH"" (but duplicate H if position 5 is H? Our pattern is ?EATH, so if we put H at position 1, it would be H E A T H, which is ""HEATH"", but then position 1 is H and position 5 is H, so duplicate. But in feedback, for DEATH, H was marked correct at position 5, but if the secret is ""HEATH"", then in DEATH, D was absent (which is correct, since ""HEATH"" has no D), and E,A,T,H all correct? But in DEATH, we have D1 (absent), E2 (correct), A3 (correct), T4 (correct), H5 (correct). So for ""HEATH"", the feedback would be: D(x) because D not in word, E(✓), A(✓), T(✓), H(✓). But position 1 of secret is H, which is not in DEATH? DEATH has D at position 1, which is absent, but secret has H at position 1. So in the feedback for DEATH, position 1 is D, which is absent, so it doesn't reveal anything about H.

But in the secret word ""HEATH"", it has H at position 1 and 5. But in the feedback for DEATH, we only have H at position 5 marked correct, but position 1 is D (absent). So it doesn't tell us about the first letter.

However, in the word ""HEATH"", the letter H appears twice. In Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback can be tricky. For example, if the secret has two H's, and you guess one H in the correct position and one missing, it might show both. But in this case, for DEATH: 
- D: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓)
- A: correct position (✓)
- T: correct position (✓)
- H: correct position (✓) for position 5.

But the secret has an extra H at position 1. Since DEATH has only one H (at position 5), and it's marked correct, the feedback doesn't indicate that there is another H. In standard Wordle rules, if the secret has duplicate letters, and you guess a letter once, it will only show the feedback for the one you guessed, and if it's in the correct position, it gets ✓, and it doesn't tell you about the duplicate if not guessed. But if you guess a letter once and it's present, it might be marked for one occurrence, but if there is a duplicate, it might not be reflected.

To avoid confusion, and since previous guesses didn't have duplicates, I'll assume the secret has distinct letters.

Therefore, position 1 cannot be H, E, A, T.

So we need a letter for position 1 that is not in {E,A,T,H} and not in {C,R,N,L,S,D}.

Possible letters: B, F, G, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Now, what words fit ?EATH.

Common 5-letter words ending with EATH: 
- ""HEATH"" (but duplicate H, so if distinct, not allowed)
- ""NEATH"" (N excluded)
- ""LEATH"" (not a word)
- ""MEATH"" (not a common word, usually part of ""meat"" or place name)
- ""YEATH"" (not a word)
- ""PEATH"" (not a word)

Perhaps ""BREATH"" is 6 letters.

I think ""EATH"" is not a common ending for 5-letter words with distinct letters.

Another idea: perhaps the word is ""DEATH"" but D was absent, so not.

Or ""HEATH"" with duplicate.

But let's check the feedback again.

In guess 3: DEATH -> D(x) E(✓) A(✓) T(✓) H(✓)

This means that the secret word has E, A, T, H in positions 2,3,4,5, and D is not in the word.

So the secret is ? E A T H, with the first letter not D and not any excluded.

But what words are there?

""Wreath"" is 6 letters.

""Beneath"" longer.

Perhaps ""cheth"" is not 5.

I think I missed a common word: ""HEATH"" is 5 letters: H-E-A-T-H.

But duplicate H.

In Wordle, duplicates are allowed, but in this case, for the feedback of DEATH: the secret ""HEATH"" has two H's. When guessing DEATH, which has one H at position 5, that H is correct (✓), and the first H in secret is not guessed, so it doesn't affect the feedback. The feedback would be D(x) (since not in secret), E(✓), A(✓), T(✓), H(✓). So it matches the feedback we have.

Therefore, ""HEATH"" is a possibility.

But in ""HEATH"", position 1 is H, which is the same as position 5. But is that allowed? Yes, Wordle allows duplicate letters.

In the first guess, CRANE had all distinct, but secret might have duplicates.

In the second guess, LEAST had distinct, but secret might have duplicates.

So ""HEATH"" is possible.

Another word: ""NEATH"" but N is excluded.

""LEATH"" not a word.

""KEATH"" not a word.

""MEATH"" not common.

""PEATH"" not word.

So the only common word is ""HEATH"".

But in ""HEATH"", the first letter is H, which is the same as position 5.

But in our pattern, position 5 is H, so position 1 being H would be duplicate.

But it's possible.

Are there other words?

What about ""TEATH"" not word.

Another possibility: perhaps the word is ""BEATH"" not common.

Or ""WEATH"" not word.

I think ""HEATH"" is the only common word.

But let's confirm the feedback.

If secret is ""HEATH"":

- Guess 1: CRANE -> C (x, not in), R (x), A (✓ position 3), N (x), E (- , present but not position 5; in secret, E is position 2, so correct, but in CRANE it was position 2? CRANE: C1,R2,A3,N4,E5. Feedback: A(✓) for position 3, E(-) for position 5 meaning E is in word but not at 5. In secret, E is at position 2, so it should be marked as present but wrong position? But in the feedback, for CRANE, E was at position 5 and marked ""-"", which is correct because E is at position 2 in secret, not 5.

- Guess 2: LEAST -> L1 (x, not in), E2 (✓, correct position), A3 (✓), S4 (x, not in), T5 (-, present but not position 5; in secret, T is at position 4, so it should be present but not position 5? In LEAST, T is at position 5, and in secret T is at position 4, so T is present but not at position 5, so ""-"" is correct.

- Guess 3: DEATH -> D1 (x, not in secret), E2 (✓), A3 (✓), T4 (✓, correct position), H5 (✓, correct position). In secret ""HEATH"", position 1 is H, which is not D, so D absent is correct. E2, A3, T4, H5 all match.

So it fits.

But in ""HEATH"", position 1 is H, which is the same as position 5. But since the feedback doesn't show any issue, it's possible.

Is there a word with different first letter?

Another word: ""sheath"" is 6 letters.

""wreath"" 6 letters.

""beneath"" 7.

So for 5 letters, ""HEATH"" seems the only common word.

But let's see if there are others.

""meath"" is sometimes used, but not common.

""yeath"" no.

So I think ""HEATH"" is the answer.

But in the game, we need to guess it.

Since we have four positions fixed, and only position 1 unknown, but with constraints.

In guess 4, we have D(x), so position 1 is not D.

And excluded letters.

But for position 1, it must be a letter that with E,A,T,H forms a word.

So ""HEATH"" is the word.

Perhaps ""PEATY"" but that's different pattern.

No.

So I'll guess ""HEATH"".

But in ""HEATH"", position 1 is H, which is the same as position 5. But it's acceptable.

To confirm, let's see if there is a word with a different letter.

Another word: ""BEATH"" is not a standard English word.

""GEATH"" no.

""KEATH"" no.

So ""HEATH"" is the only possibility.

Therefore, the next guess is ""HEATH"".

But we already have four letters fixed, so this should be the solution.

In the feedback for guess 4, we have D(x) E(✓) A(✓) T(✓) H(✓), which means only position 1 is wrong, and the rest are correct. So the secret must be ?EATH with ? not D and not excluded, and ""HEATH"" fits.

So I'll go with that.

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
1. **Guess 1 (CRANE)**:  
   - C (x): Absent from the secret word.  
   - R (x): Absent.  
   - A (✓): Correct and in position 3.  
   - N (x): Absent.  
   - E (-): Present in the word but not in position 5.  

2. **Guess 2 (LEAST)**:  
   - L (x): Absent.  
   - E (✓): Correct and in position 2 (confirms E is fixed at position 2).  
   - A (✓): Correct and in position 3 (reaffirmed).  
   - S (x): Absent.  
   - T (-): Present in the word but not in position 5.  

3. **Guess 3 (DEATH)**:  
   - D (x): Absent.  
   - E (✓): Correct and in position 2 (fixed).  
   - A (✓): Correct and in position 3 (fixed).  
   - T (✓): Correct and in position 4 (now fixed).  
   - H (✓): Correct and in position 5 (now fixed).  

### Key Insights:
- **Fixed positions**:  
  - Position 2: E  
  - Position 3: A  
  - Position 4: T  
  - Position 5: H  
- **Secret word pattern**: `[unknown] E A T H` (only position 1 is unsolved).  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, L, S, D (cannot appear in position 1).  
- **Constraints for position 1**:  
  - Must be a letter not in `{E, A, T, H}` (assuming distinct letters, as no duplicates were indicated in feedback).  
  - Must form a valid English word with ""EATH"".  
  - Common possibilities (e.g., B, F, G, M, P, W, Y) were considered, but only ""H"" forms a valid word (""HEATH"").  

### Reasoning for the Next Guess:
- The secret word must end with ""EATH"", and position 1 must be a letter that completes a valid 5-letter word.  
- ""HEATH"" (meaning a type of shrubland) is the only common English word fitting the pattern `_ E A T H`.  
- While ""HEATH"" has a duplicate ""H"" (position 1 and 5), this is allowed in Wordle rules, and the feedback from Guess 3 (DEATH) is consistent with ""HEATH"":  
  - D (x): Absent (correct, as ""HEATH"" has no D).  
  - E, A, T, H (✓): All in correct positions.  
- Other words like ""NEATH"" (invalid due to N) or ""MEATH"" (uncommon) were rejected based on exclusions or rarity.  

<thinking>
- Position 1 must be H to form ""HEATH"", as it is the only feasible word given constraints.
- This guess resolves the unknown position while adhering to feedback.
</thinking>

<guess>HEATH</guess>",HEATH,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)
Meaning:
- A is correct and in position 3.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.
- C, R, N are not in the word.

Guess 2: LEAST -> L(x) E(✓) A(✓) S(x) T(-)
Meaning:
- E is correct and in position 2 (so position 2 is E).
- A is correct and in position 3 (confirmed).
- T is in the word but not in position 5.
- L and S are not in the word.

Guess 3: DEATH -> D(x) E(✓) A(✓) T(✓) H(✓)
Meaning:
- E is correct in position 2 (already known).
- A is correct in position 3 (known).
- T is correct in position 4 (so position 4 is T).
- H is correct in position 5 (so position 5 is H).
- D is not in the word.

Now, combining all feedback:

- Position 2: E (fixed)
- Position 3: A (fixed)
- Position 4: T (fixed)
- Position 5: H (fixed)
- Position 1: Unknown, but we know it cannot be D, C, R, N, L, S (from previous exclusions).

Also, from the first guess, E was not in position 5 (but now we know position 5 is H, so that's consistent). T was not in position 5 (now we know it's in position 4).

The secret word is now: ? E A T H

We only need to find the first letter.

Excluded letters: C, R, N, L, S, D (from the x's in the feedback).

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

Possible letters for position 1: any letter not excluded and not already in the word (assuming no duplicates, as there's no indication of duplicates so far).

The word has E, A, T, H. So position 1 cannot be any of these? Not necessarily, but since they are already placed, and no feedback suggests duplicates, we assume distinct letters.

So position 1 must be a letter not in {E, A, T, H} and not in the excluded set {C, R, N, L, S, D}.

Common letters left: B, F, G, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word ending with ""EATH"" but with the first letter not excluded.

Common words: 
- ""HEATH"" but H is already at position 5? ""HEATH"" would be H,E,A,T,H? But that has H at position 1 and 5, duplicate. But in our pattern, position 1 is unknown, position 5 is H. So if position 1 is H, then duplicate H? But feedback hasn't indicated duplicates, so maybe not.

In previous guesses, all letters were distinct, so likely secret has distinct letters.

Therefore, position 1 cannot be H (since H is at 5), cannot be E (at 2), A (at 3), T (at 4).

So must be a different letter.

Words like ""NEATH"" but N is excluded.

""LEATH"" not a word.

""YEATH"" not a word.

""MEATH"" not common, but ""meath"" is not standard.

Common word: ""WREATH"" but W,R,E,A,T,H? 6 letters? No, 6 letters.

5-letter words ending with EATH: 

- ""HEATH"" (but duplicate H if position 5 is H? Our pattern is ?EATH, so if we put H at position 1, it would be H E A T H, which is ""HEATH"", but then position 1 is H and position 5 is H, so duplicate. But in feedback, for DEATH, H was marked correct at position 5, but if the secret is ""HEATH"", then in DEATH, D was absent (which is correct, since ""HEATH"" has no D), and E,A,T,H all correct? But in DEATH, we have D1 (absent), E2 (correct), A3 (correct), T4 (correct), H5 (correct). So for ""HEATH"", the feedback would be: D(x) because D not in word, E(✓), A(✓), T(✓), H(✓). But position 1 of secret is H, which is not in DEATH? DEATH has D at position 1, which is absent, but secret has H at position 1. So in the feedback for DEATH, position 1 is D, which is absent, so it doesn't reveal anything about H.

But in the secret word ""HEATH"", it has H at position 1 and 5. But in the feedback for DEATH, we only have H at position 5 marked correct, but position 1 is D (absent). So it doesn't tell us about the first letter.

However, in the word ""HEATH"", the letter H appears twice. In Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback can be tricky. For example, if the secret has two H's, and you guess one H in the correct position and one missing, it might show both. But in this case, for DEATH: 
- D: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓)
- A: correct position (✓)
- T: correct position (✓)
- H: correct position (✓) for position 5.

But the secret has an extra H at position 1. Since DEATH has only one H (at position 5), and it's marked correct, the feedback doesn't indicate that there is another H. In standard Wordle rules, if the secret has duplicate letters, and you guess a letter once, it will only show the feedback for the one you guessed, and if it's in the correct position, it gets ✓, and it doesn't tell you about the duplicate if not guessed. But if you guess a letter once and it's present, it might be marked for one occurrence, but if there is a duplicate, it might not be reflected.

To avoid confusion, and since previous guesses didn't have duplicates, I'll assume the secret has distinct letters.

Therefore, position 1 cannot be H, E, A, T.

So we need a letter for position 1 that is not in {E,A,T,H} and not in {C,R,N,L,S,D}.

Possible letters: B, F, G, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Now, what words fit ?EATH.

Common 5-letter words ending with EATH: 
- ""HEATH"" (but duplicate H, so if distinct, not allowed)
- ""NEATH"" (N excluded)
- ""LEATH"" (not a word)
- ""MEATH"" (not a common word, usually part of ""meat"" or place name)
- ""YEATH"" (not a word)
- ""PEATH"" (not a word)

Perhaps ""BREATH"" is 6 letters.

I think ""EATH"" is not a common ending for 5-letter words with distinct letters.

Another idea: perhaps the word is ""DEATH"" but D was absent, so not.

Or ""HEATH"" with duplicate.

But let's check the feedback again.

In guess 3: DEATH -> D(x) E(✓) A(✓) T(✓) H(✓)

This means that the secret word has E, A, T, H in positions 2,3,4,5, and D is not in the word.

So the secret is ? E A T H, with the first letter not D and not any excluded.

But what words are there?

""Wreath"" is 6 letters.

""Beneath"" longer.

Perhaps ""cheth"" is not 5.

I think I missed a common word: ""HEATH"" is 5 letters: H-E-A-T-H.

But duplicate H.

In Wordle, duplicates are allowed, but in this case, for the feedback of DEATH: the secret ""HEATH"" has two H's. When guessing DEATH, which has one H at position 5, that H is correct (✓), and the first H in secret is not guessed, so it doesn't affect the feedback. The feedback would be D(x) (since not in secret), E(✓), A(✓), T(✓), H(✓). So it matches the feedback we have.

Therefore, ""HEATH"" is a possibility.

But in ""HEATH"", position 1 is H, which is the same as position 5. But is that allowed? Yes, Wordle allows duplicate letters.

In the first guess, CRANE had all distinct, but secret might have duplicates.

In the second guess, LEAST had distinct, but secret might have duplicates.

So ""HEATH"" is possible.

Another word: ""NEATH"" but N is excluded.

""LEATH"" not a word.

""KEATH"" not a word.

""MEATH"" not common.

""PEATH"" not word.

So the only common word is ""HEATH"".

But in ""HEATH"", the first letter is H, which is the same as position 5.

But in our pattern, position 5 is H, so position 1 being H would be duplicate.

But it's possible.

Are there other words?

What about ""TEATH"" not word.

Another possibility: perhaps the word is ""BEATH"" not common.

Or ""WEATH"" not word.

I think ""HEATH"" is the only common word.

But let's confirm the feedback.

If secret is ""HEATH"":

- Guess 1: CRANE -> C (x, not in), R (x), A (✓ position 3), N (x), E (- , present but not position 5; in secret, E is position 2, so correct, but in CRANE it was position 2? CRANE: C1,R2,A3,N4,E5. Feedback: A(✓) for position 3, E(-) for position 5 meaning E is in word but not at 5. In secret, E is at position 2, so it should be marked as present but wrong position? But in the feedback, for CRANE, E was at position 5 and marked ""-"", which is correct because E is at position 2 in secret, not 5.

- Guess 2: LEAST -> L1 (x, not in), E2 (✓, correct position), A3 (✓), S4 (x, not in), T5 (-, present but not position 5; in secret, T is at position 4, so it should be present but not position 5? In LEAST, T is at position 5, and in secret T is at position 4, so T is present but not at position 5, so ""-"" is correct.

- Guess 3: DEATH -> D1 (x, not in secret), E2 (✓), A3 (✓), T4 (✓, correct position), H5 (✓, correct position). In secret ""HEATH"", position 1 is H, which is not D, so D absent is correct. E2, A3, T4, H5 all match.

So it fits.

But in ""HEATH"", position 1 is H, which is the same as position 5. But since the feedback doesn't show any issue, it's possible.

Is there a word with different first letter?

Another word: ""sheath"" is 6 letters.

""wreath"" 6 letters.

""beneath"" 7.

So for 5 letters, ""HEATH"" seems the only common word.

But let's see if there are others.

""meath"" is sometimes used, but not common.

""yeath"" no.

So I think ""HEATH"" is the answer.

But in the game, we need to guess it.

Since we have four positions fixed, and only position 1 unknown, but with constraints.

In guess 4, we have D(x), so position 1 is not D.

And excluded letters.

But for position 1, it must be a letter that with E,A,T,H forms a word.

So ""HEATH"" is the word.

Perhaps ""PEATY"" but that's different pattern.

No.

So I'll guess ""HEATH"".

But in ""HEATH"", position 1 is H, which is the same as position 5. But it's acceptable.

To confirm, let's see if there is a word with a different letter.

Another word: ""BEATH"" is not a standard English word.

""GEATH"" no.

""KEATH"" no.

So ""HEATH"" is the only possibility.

Therefore, the next guess is ""HEATH"".

But we already have four letters fixed, so this should be the solution.

In the feedback for guess 4, we have D(x) E(✓) A(✓) T(✓) H(✓), which means only position 1 is wrong, and the rest are correct. So the secret must be ?EATH with ? not D and not excluded, and ""HEATH"" fits.

So I'll go with that.### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
