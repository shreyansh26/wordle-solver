We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R was in position 2 and E in position 5 of ""crane"", so in the secret word:
     R is not at position 2.
     E is not at position 5.

 - The letters C, A, N are not in the word at all.

 We also know the secret word is 5 letters.

 Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
   - Does not contain C, A, N (since they are absent).
   - Includes R and E (since they are present) but in different positions than in the first guess.
   - We might also want to include other common letters to test.

 Let's think about the positions:
   In ""crane"", the positions are:
     1: C (absent)
     2: R (present but wrong position) -> so R must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? Actually, no: we know it's not at 2, but it could be at 1,3,4,5? However, note that in the feedback, we have a '-' for R meaning it is in the word but not at position 2. Similarly, E is not at position 5.

 But note: the feedback doesn't tell us that R cannot be at position 1,3,4,5? Actually, it can be at any position except 2. Similarly, E can be at any position except 5.

 However, we must also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But the rules don't specify, so we assume no duplicates unless feedback suggests otherwise. But in this feedback, we don't have any duplicates.

 Now, for the second guess, we want to try to place R and E in new positions and also test new letters.

 We know the word has R and E. Let's try to think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N.

 Also, we want to cover more common letters. Common consonants besides R: T, L, S, etc. Common vowels: we have E, and we know A is absent, so other vowels: O, I, U? But we have E already.

 Let's try to form a word:

 We know:
   Position 1: cannot be C (absent) and we don't know about others. But we can try to put R at position 1? Or E? Or a new letter.

 Since R is in the word and not at position 2, let's try putting R at position 1. And E is not at position 5, so let's put E at position 4? Or 3? We have to choose.

 Also, we need to avoid positions that we know are wrong for R and E? Actually, we only know that R is not at 2 and E is not at 5. So:

   For R: allowed positions: 1, 3, 4, 5.
   For E: allowed positions: 1, 2, 3, 4.

 We can try to put R at position 1 and E at position 3? Or position 4? 

 Let's think of words that start with R and have E in the middle.

 Example: ""REBEL"" -> but that has E at position 2 and 4? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have to avoid A and C and N.

 But note: we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. The rules don't forbid it, but we haven't seen any feedback suggesting duplicates. So we should avoid assuming duplicates until necessary.

 Alternatively, let's try a word that has R at position 1 and E at position 4? 

 Example: ""ROUTE"" -> but we don't know if O and U and T are in the word? Also, we have E at position 5? But wait, in ""ROUTE"", E is at position 5, which we know is not allowed for E (because in the first guess E was at position 5 and got a '-', meaning E is in the word but not at position 5). So we cannot put E at position 5.

 So we need E at positions 1,2,3, or 4.

 Let me try: ""RESTY"" -> R at 1, E at 2, S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5. But we don't know if S, T, Y are in the word? And we are testing new letters.

 However, note that in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and now we are putting R at position 1. That's allowed because the feedback only said R is not at position 2.

 Similarly, E was at position 5 and now we put it at position 2.

 But wait: what if the word has two R's? We don't know. But we can try.

 Alternatively, we can avoid putting R at position 1 and try a different position? But we have to test.

 Another idea: we know the word has R and E. We can try to put R at position 3 and E at position 1? For example: ""PERKY"" -> P, E, R, K, Y.

 But we don't know if P, K, Y are in the word? And we are avoiding C, A, N.

 However, we have to test new letters.

 Let me list some words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N:

   - R at position 1: 
        R E _ _ _ -> e.g., ""RESET"" (but duplicate E? and we don't know if duplicates are allowed) -> but we don't want to assume duplicates. Also, we have to avoid A and C and N.
        ""REBUS"" -> R E B U S -> but E is at position 2? and we don't know about B, U, S.

   - R at position 3:
        _ _ R E _ -> e.g., ""BORED"" -> but O is new? and D is new. Also, E is at position 4? which is allowed.

   - R at position 4:
        _ _ _ R E -> but E is at position 5? which is not allowed. So we cannot put E at 5. So if we put R at 4, then E must be at 1,2,3? but then we have two positions to fill? 

        Example: _ _ _ R _ and then put E at 1: ""E _ _ R _"", e.g., ""EVERY"" -> but duplicate E? and we don't know.

   - R at position 5: 
        _ _ _ _ R, and E at one of 1,2,3,4. Example: ""LATER"" -> but L, T, E, R -> but E is at position 4? and R at 5. But we have to avoid A? ""LATER"" has A which is absent! So we cannot use A.

        Without A: ""TIGER"" -> T I G E R -> E at position 4? and R at 5. But we don't know about T, I, G.

 Considering the above, let's try to choose a word that:

   - Contains R and E (since we know they are in the word).
   - Avoids C, A, N (absent letters).
   - Puts R in a new position (not position 2) and E in a new position (not position 5).
   - Uses common letters to maximize information.

 One candidate: ""ROGUE"" -> R at 1, O, G, U, E at 5? -> but E at 5 is not allowed. So skip.

 Another: ""RIPER"" -> duplicate R? and we don't know. Also, E at position 5? not allowed.

 How about ""ROBES""? -> R at 1, O, B, E at 4, S at 5. 
   E is at position 4 (allowed) and R at 1 (allowed). 
   Letters: R, O, B, E, S. We avoid C, A, N.

 But note: we don't know if O, B, S are in the word? This is a good test.

 Alternatively, ""RESTY"": R at 1, E at 2, S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5. 
   E is at position 2 (allowed) and R at 1 (allowed). 
   We test S, T, Y.

 Another common word: ""TRIED"" -> T, R, I, E, D. 
   R is at position 2? But wait, we know R is in the word but not at position 2. So we cannot put R at position 2 again? 
   Actually, we can put R at position 2? But the feedback told us that in the first guess R was at position 2 and that was wrong. So in the secret word, R is not at position 2. Therefore, in our new guess, if we put R at position 2, then we know it will be marked as '-' again? Because the secret word does not have R at position 2. But we already know that. So it's a waste of a position? 

   We want to test R in a new position to see if we can get a '✓'. So it's better to put R in a position we haven't tried and that is allowed (1,3,4,5). Similarly for E.

 In ""TRIED"", R is at position 2? That would be the same as the first guess? And we know it's not at 2. So we avoid that.

 How about ""DRIVE""? -> D, R, I, V, E. 
   R is at position 2? Again, same problem.

 We need to avoid position 2 for R.

 Let me try: ""PRICE"" -> but C is absent? We cannot use C.

 Without C: ""PRIDE"" -> P, R, I, D, E. 
   R is at position 2? Again, position 2 for R is not allowed? We know R is not at position 2 in the secret word. So if we put R at position 2, we will get a '-' again. But we are trying to find the correct position. So we should avoid position 2 for R.

 How about ""PERIL""? -> P, E, R, I, L. 
   R is at position 3 (which is allowed) and E at position 2 (which is allowed for E? yes, because E was only forbidden at position 5). 
   Letters: P, E, R, I, L. We avoid C, A, N.

 This seems good.

 Another candidate: ""BERYL"" -> B, E, R, Y, L. 
   E at position 2, R at position 3. 
   But we don't know about B, Y, L.

 However, note: we have already used E at position 2? But that's okay because we are testing.

 But wait: in the first guess, we had E at position 5 and got a '-'. Now we are putting E at position 2. If the secret word has E at position 2, we'll get a '✓'. If not, we'll get a '-'. Similarly for R at position 3.

 I think ""PERIL"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and tests new positions.

 Alternatively, ""ROUSE"": R at 1, O, U, S, E at 5? -> E at 5 is not allowed.

 How about ""ROLES"": R at 1, O, L, E at 4, S at 5? 
   E is at position 4? That's allowed. 
   So: R(1), O(2), L(3), E(4), S(5). 

 This is also a candidate.

 But note: we have to avoid using the same letter in the same position if we know it's wrong? We don't have any other constraints.

 Let me compare:

   ""PERIL"": tests positions: 
        P at 1 (new)
        E at 2 (new for E, since E was at 5 before)
        R at 3 (new for R, since R was at 2 before)
        I at 4 (new)
        L at 5 (new)

   ""ROLES"": 
        R at 1 (new for R)
        O at 2 (new)
        L at 3 (new)
        E at 4 (new for E, since E was at 5 before)
        S at 5 (new)

 Both are valid. But we want to cover more common consonants. The letters in ""PERIL"": P, E, R, I, L. Common letters: E, R, L, I, P.
 The letters in ""ROLES"": R, O, L, E, S. Common letters: R, O, L, E, S.

 Since S and O are very common, maybe ""ROLES"" is better? But we also have L and E in both.

 However, we already know R and E are in the word, so we are confirming their positions. The other letters (O, L, S) are common and we haven't tested them.

 I think ""ROLES"" is a good choice.

 But wait: what if the secret word has E at position 4? Then we get a '✓' for E. Similarly, if R is at position 1, we get a '✓'. 

 Alternatively, we might get '-' for R and E if they are in the word but not at these positions.

 Let's go with ""ROLES"".

 However, note: we are not forced to use R and E? Actually, we must use them because we know they are in the word? But the rules don't require that we use known letters? But if we don't use them, we won't get information about their positions. So it's better to use them.

 So I decide: ""ROLES""

 But let me check: is ""ROLES"" a valid word? Yes.

 Therefore, second guess: ""ROLES""

<guess>roles</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and N are **absent** (marked ""x"").
- R is **present** but not in position 2 (marked ""-"").
- E is **present** but not in position 5 (marked ""-"").

For the second guess:
- Must include **R** and **E** (since they are in the secret word).
- Avoid C, A, and N.
- Place R in a new position (not 2): options are 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- Place E in a new position (not 5): options are 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- Test new common letters (like S, O, L) to gather more information.

Chose **""ROLES""** because:
- R is at position 1 (new position for R).
- E is at position 4 (new position for E).
- Tests new letters: O, L, S (common consonants).
- Avoids C, A, N.

<guess>roles</guess>",roles,"We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R was in position 2 and E in position 5 of ""crane"", so in the secret word:
     R is not at position 2.
     E is not at position 5.

 - The letters C, A, N are not in the word at all.

 We also know the secret word is 5 letters.

 Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
   - Does not contain C, A, N (since they are absent).
   - Includes R and E (since they are present) but in different positions than in the first guess.
   - We might also want to include other common letters to test.

 Let's think about the positions:
   In ""crane"", the positions are:
     1: C (absent)
     2: R (present but wrong position) -> so R must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? Actually, no: we know it's not at 2, but it could be at 1,3,4,5? However, note that in the feedback, we have a '-' for R meaning it is in the word but not at position 2. Similarly, E is not at position 5.

 But note: the feedback doesn't tell us that R cannot be at position 1,3,4,5? Actually, it can be at any position except 2. Similarly, E can be at any position except 5.

 However, we must also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But the rules don't specify, so we assume no duplicates unless feedback suggests otherwise. But in this feedback, we don't have any duplicates.

 Now, for the second guess, we want to try to place R and E in new positions and also test new letters.

 We know the word has R and E. Let's try to think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N.

 Also, we want to cover more common letters. Common consonants besides R: T, L, S, etc. Common vowels: we have E, and we know A is absent, so other vowels: O, I, U? But we have E already.

 Let's try to form a word:

 We know:
   Position 1: cannot be C (absent) and we don't know about others. But we can try to put R at position 1? Or E? Or a new letter.

 Since R is in the word and not at position 2, let's try putting R at position 1. And E is not at position 5, so let's put E at position 4? Or 3? We have to choose.

 Also, we need to avoid positions that we know are wrong for R and E? Actually, we only know that R is not at 2 and E is not at 5. So:

   For R: allowed positions: 1, 3, 4, 5.
   For E: allowed positions: 1, 2, 3, 4.

 We can try to put R at position 1 and E at position 3? Or position 4? 

 Let's think of words that start with R and have E in the middle.

 Example: ""REBEL"" -> but that has E at position 2 and 4? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have to avoid A and C and N.

 But note: we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. The rules don't forbid it, but we haven't seen any feedback suggesting duplicates. So we should avoid assuming duplicates until necessary.

 Alternatively, let's try a word that has R at position 1 and E at position 4? 

 Example: ""ROUTE"" -> but we don't know if O and U and T are in the word? Also, we have E at position 5? But wait, in ""ROUTE"", E is at position 5, which we know is not allowed for E (because in the first guess E was at position 5 and got a '-', meaning E is in the word but not at position 5). So we cannot put E at position 5.

 So we need E at positions 1,2,3, or 4.

 Let me try: ""RESTY"" -> R at 1, E at 2, S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5. But we don't know if S, T, Y are in the word? And we are testing new letters.

 However, note that in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and now we are putting R at position 1. That's allowed because the feedback only said R is not at position 2.

 Similarly, E was at position 5 and now we put it at position 2.

 But wait: what if the word has two R's? We don't know. But we can try.

 Alternatively, we can avoid putting R at position 1 and try a different position? But we have to test.

 Another idea: we know the word has R and E. We can try to put R at position 3 and E at position 1? For example: ""PERKY"" -> P, E, R, K, Y.

 But we don't know if P, K, Y are in the word? And we are avoiding C, A, N.

 However, we have to test new letters.

 Let me list some words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N:

   - R at position 3:
        _ _ R E _ -> e.g., ""BORED"" -> but O is new? and D is new. Also, E is at position 4? which is allowed.

   - R at position 4:
        _ _ _ R E -> but E is at position 5? which is not allowed. So we cannot put E at 5. So if we put R at 4, then E must be at 1,2,3? but then we have two positions to fill? 

        Example: _ _ _ R _ and then put E at 1: ""E _ _ R _"", e.g., ""EVERY"" -> but duplicate E? and we don't know.

   - R at position 5: 
        _ _ _ _ R, and E at one of 1,2,3,4. Example: ""LATER"" -> but L, T, E, R -> but E is at position 4? and R at 5. But we have to avoid A? ""LATER"" has A which is absent! So we cannot use A.

        Without A: ""TIGER"" -> T I G E R -> E at position 4? and R at 5. But we don't know about T, I, G.

 Considering the above, let's try to choose a word that:

   - Contains R and E (since we know they are in the word).

 But note: we don't know if O, B, S are in the word? This is a good test.

 Alternatively, ""RESTY"": R at 1, E at 2, S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5. 
   E is at position 2 (allowed) and R at 1 (allowed). 
   We test S, T, Y.

 Another common word: ""TRIED"" -> T, R, I, E, D. 
   R is at position 2? But wait, we know R is in the word but not at position 2. So we cannot put R at position 2 again? 
   Actually, we can put R at position 2? But the feedback told us that in the first guess R was at position 2 and that was wrong. So in the secret word, R is not at position 2. Therefore, in our new guess, if we put R at position 2, then we know it will be marked as '-' again? Because the secret word does not have R at position 2. But we already know that. So it's a waste of a position? 

   We want to test R in a new position to see if we can get a '✓'. So it's better to put R in a position we haven't tried and that is allowed (1,3,4,5). Similarly for E.

 In ""TRIED"", R is at position 2? That would be the same as the first guess? And we know it's not at 2. So we avoid that.

 How about ""DRIVE""? -> D, R, I, V, E. 
   R is at position 2? Again, same problem.

 We need to avoid position 2 for R.

 Let me try: ""PRICE"" -> but C is absent? We cannot use C.

 Without C: ""PRIDE"" -> P, R, I, D, E. 
   R is at position 2? Again, position 2 for R is not allowed? We know R is not at position 2 in the secret word. So if we put R at position 2, we will get a '-' again. But we are trying to find the correct position. So we should avoid position 2 for R.

 How about ""PERIL""? -> P, E, R, I, L. 
   R is at position 3 (which is allowed) and E at position 2 (which is allowed for E? yes, because E was only forbidden at position 5). 
   Letters: P, E, R, I, L. We avoid C, A, N.

 This seems good.

 Another candidate: ""BERYL"" -> B, E, R, Y, L. 
   E at position 2, R at position 3. 
   But we don't know about B, Y, L.

 However, note: we have already used E at position 2? But that's okay because we are testing.

 But wait: in the first guess, we had E at position 5 and got a '-'. Now we are putting E at position 2. If the secret word has E at position 2, we'll get a '✓'. If not, we'll get a '-'. Similarly for R at position 3.

 I think ""PERIL"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and tests new positions.

 Alternatively, ""ROUSE"": R at 1, O, U, S, E at 5? -> E at 5 is not allowed.

 How about ""ROLES"": R at 1, O, L, E at 4, S at 5? 
   E is at position 4? That's allowed. 
   So: R(1), O(2), L(3), E(4), S(5). 

 This is also a candidate.

 But note: we have to avoid using the same letter in the same position if we know it's wrong? We don't have any other constraints.

 Let me compare:

   ""PERIL"": tests positions: 
        P at 1 (new)
        E at 2 (new for E, since E was at 5 before)
        R at 3 (new for R, since R was at 2 before)
        I at 4 (new)
        L at 5 (new)

   ""ROLES"": 
        R at 1 (new for R)
        O at 2 (new)
        L at 3 (new)
        E at 4 (new for E, since E was at 5 before)
        S at 5 (new)

 Both are valid. But we want to cover more common consonants. The letters in ""PERIL"": P, E, R, I, L. Common letters: E, R, L, I, P.
 The letters in ""ROLES"": R, O, L, E, S. Common letters: R, O, L, E, S.

 Since S and O are very common, maybe ""ROLES"" is better? But we also have L and E in both.

 However, we already know R and E are in the word, so we are confirming their positions. The other letters (O, L, S) are common and we haven't tested them.

 I think ""ROLES"" is a good choice.

 But wait: what if the secret word has E at position 4? Then we get a '✓' for E. Similarly, if R is at position 1, we get a '✓'. 

 Alternatively, we might get '-' for R and E if they are in the word but not at these positions.

 Let's go with ""ROLES"".

 However, note: we are not forced to use R and E? Actually, we must use them because we know they are in the word? But the rules don't require that we use known letters? But if we don't use them, we won't get information about their positions. So it's better to use them.

 So I decide: ""ROLES""

 But let me check: is ""ROLES"" a valid word? Yes.

 Therefore, second guess: ""ROLES""

<guess>roles</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and N are **absent** (marked ""x"").
- R is **present** but not in position 2 (marked ""-"").
- E is **present** but not in position 5 (marked ""-"").

For the second guess:
- Must include **R** and **E** (since they are in the secret word).
- Avoid C, A, and N.
- Place R in a new position (not 2): options are 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- Place E in a new position (not 5): options are 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- Test new common letters (like S, O, L) to gather more information.

Chose **""ROLES""** because:
- R is at position 1 (new position for R).
- E is at position 4 (new position for E).
- Tests new letters: O, L, S (common consonants).
- Avoids C, A, N.",Guess 2: roles -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) L(-) E(✓) S(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,FLYER,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R was in position 2 and E in position 5 of ""crane"", so in the secret word:
     R is not at position 2.
     E is not at position 5.

 - The letters C, A, N are not in the word at all.

 We also know the secret word is 5 letters.

 Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
   - Does not contain C, A, N (since they are absent).
   - Includes R and E (since they are present) but in different positions than in the first guess.
   - We might also want to include other common letters to test.

 Let's think about the positions:
   In ""crane"", the positions are:
     1: C (absent)
     2: R (present but wrong position) -> so R must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? Actually, no: we know it's not at 2, but it could be at 1,3,4,5? However, note that in the feedback, we have a '-' for R meaning it is in the word but not at position 2. Similarly, E is not at position 5.

 But note: the feedback doesn't tell us that R cannot be at position 1,3,4,5? Actually, it can be at any position except 2. Similarly, E can be at any position except 5.

 However, we must also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But the rules don't specify, so we assume no duplicates unless feedback suggests otherwise. But in this feedback, we don't have any duplicates.

 Now, for the second guess, we want to try to place R and E in new positions and also test new letters.

 We know the word has R and E. Let's try to think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N.

 Also, we want to cover more common letters. Common consonants besides R: T, L, S, etc. Common vowels: we have E, and we know A is absent, so other vowels: O, I, U? But we have E already.

 Let's try to form a word:

 We know:
   Position 1: cannot be C (absent) and we don't know about others. But we can try to put R at position 1? Or E? Or a new letter.

 Since R is in the word and not at position 2, let's try putting R at position 1. And E is not at position 5, so let's put E at position 4? Or 3? We have to choose.

 Also, we need to avoid positions that we know are wrong for R and E? Actually, we only know that R is not at 2 and E is not at 5. So:

   For R: allowed positions: 1, 3, 4, 5.
   For E: allowed positions: 1, 2, 3, 4.

 We can try to put R at position 1 and E at position 3? Or position 4? 

 Let's think of words that start with R and have E in the middle.

 Example: ""REBEL"" -> but that has E at position 2 and 4? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have to avoid A and C and N.

 But note: we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. The rules don't forbid it, but we haven't seen any feedback suggesting duplicates. So we should avoid assuming duplicates until necessary.

 Alternatively, let's try a word that has R at position 1 and E at position 4? 

 Example: ""ROUTE"" -> but we don't know if O and U and T are in the word? Also, we have E at position 5? But wait, in ""ROUTE"", E is at position 5, which we know is not allowed for E (because in the first guess E was at position 5 and got a '-', meaning E is in the word but not at position 5). So we cannot put E at position 5.

 So we need E at positions 1,2,3, or 4.

 Let me try: ""RESTY"" -> R at 1, E at 2, S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5. But we don't know if S, T, Y are in the word? And we are testing new letters.

 However, note that in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and now we are putting R at position 1. That's allowed because the feedback only said R is not at position 2.

 Similarly, E was at position 5 and now we put it at position 2.

 But wait: what if the word has two R's? We don't know. But we can try.

 Alternatively, we can avoid putting R at position 1 and try a different position? But we have to test.

 Another idea: we know the word has R and E. We can try to put R at position 3 and E at position 1? For example: ""PERKY"" -> P, E, R, K, Y.

 But we don't know if P, K, Y are in the word? And we are avoiding C, A, N.

 However, we have to test new letters.

 Let me list some words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N:

   - R at position 1: 
        R E _ _ _ -> e.g., ""RESET"" (but duplicate E? and we don't know if duplicates are allowed) -> but we don't want to assume duplicates. Also, we have to avoid A and C and N.
        ""REBUS"" -> R E B U S -> but E is at position 2? and we don't know about B, U, S.

   - R at position 3:
        _ _ R E _ -> e.g., ""BORED"" -> but O is new? and D is new. Also, E is at position 4? which is allowed.

   - R at position 4:
        _ _ _ R E -> but E is at position 5? which is not allowed. So we cannot put E at 5. So if we put R at 4, then E must be at 1,2,3? but then we have two positions to fill? 

        Example: _ _ _ R _ and then put E at 1: ""E _ _ R _"", e.g., ""EVERY"" -> but duplicate E? and we don't know.

   - R at position 5: 
        _ _ _ _ R, and E at one of 1,2,3,4. Example: ""LATER"" -> but L, T, E, R -> but E is at position 4? and R at 5. But we have to avoid A? ""LATER"" has A which is absent! So we cannot use A.

        Without A: ""TIGER"" -> T I G E R -> E at position 4? and R at 5. But we don't know about T, I, G.

 Considering the above, let's try to choose a word that:

   - Contains R and E (since we know they are in the word).
   - Avoids C, A, N (absent letters).
   - Puts R in a new position (not position 2) and E in a new position (not position 5).
   - Uses common letters to maximize information.

 One candidate: ""ROGUE"" -> R at 1, O, G, U, E at 5? -> but E at 5 is not allowed. So skip.

 Another: ""RIPER"" -> duplicate R? and we don't know. Also, E at position 5? not allowed.

 How about ""ROBES""? -> R at 1, O, B, E at 4, S at 5. 
   E is at position 4 (allowed) and R at 1 (allowed). 
   Letters: R, O, B, E, S. We avoid C, A, N.

 But note: we don't know if O, B, S are in the word? This is a good test.

 Alternatively, ""RESTY"": R at 1, E at 2, S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5. 
   E is at position 2 (allowed) and R at 1 (allowed). 
   We test S, T, Y.

 Another common word: ""TRIED"" -> T, R, I, E, D. 
   R is at position 2? But wait, we know R is in the word but not at position 2. So we cannot put R at position 2 again? 
   Actually, we can put R at position 2? But the feedback told us that in the first guess R was at position 2 and that was wrong. So in the secret word, R is not at position 2. Therefore, in our new guess, if we put R at position 2, then we know it will be marked as '-' again? Because the secret word does not have R at position 2. But we already know that. So it's a waste of a position? 

   We want to test R in a new position to see if we can get a '✓'. So it's better to put R in a position we haven't tried and that is allowed (1,3,4,5). Similarly for E.

 In ""TRIED"", R is at position 2? That would be the same as the first guess? And we know it's not at 2. So we avoid that.

 How about ""DRIVE""? -> D, R, I, V, E. 
   R is at position 2? Again, same problem.

 We need to avoid position 2 for R.

 Let me try: ""PRICE"" -> but C is absent? We cannot use C.

 Without C: ""PRIDE"" -> P, R, I, D, E. 
   R is at position 2? Again, position 2 for R is not allowed? We know R is not at position 2 in the secret word. So if we put R at position 2, we will get a '-' again. But we are trying to find the correct position. So we should avoid position 2 for R.

 How about ""PERIL""? -> P, E, R, I, L. 
   R is at position 3 (which is allowed) and E at position 2 (which is allowed for E? yes, because E was only forbidden at position 5). 
   Letters: P, E, R, I, L. We avoid C, A, N.

 This seems good.

 Another candidate: ""BERYL"" -> B, E, R, Y, L. 
   E at position 2, R at position 3. 
   But we don't know about B, Y, L.

 However, note: we have already used E at position 2? But that's okay because we are testing.

 But wait: in the first guess, we had E at position 5 and got a '-'. Now we are putting E at position 2. If the secret word has E at position 2, we'll get a '✓'. If not, we'll get a '-'. Similarly for R at position 3.

 I think ""PERIL"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and tests new positions.

 Alternatively, ""ROUSE"": R at 1, O, U, S, E at 5? -> E at 5 is not allowed.

 How about ""ROLES"": R at 1, O, L, E at 4, S at 5? 
   E is at position 4? That's allowed. 
   So: R(1), O(2), L(3), E(4), S(5). 

 This is also a candidate.

 But note: we have to avoid using the same letter in the same position if we know it's wrong? We don't have any other constraints.

 Let me compare:

   ""PERIL"": tests positions: 
        P at 1 (new)
        E at 2 (new for E, since E was at 5 before)
        R at 3 (new for R, since R was at 2 before)
        I at 4 (new)
        L at 5 (new)

   ""ROLES"": 
        R at 1 (new for R)
        O at 2 (new)
        L at 3 (new)
        E at 4 (new for E, since E was at 5 before)
        S at 5 (new)

 Both are valid. But we want to cover more common consonants. The letters in ""PERIL"": P, E, R, I, L. Common letters: E, R, L, I, P.
 The letters in ""ROLES"": R, O, L, E, S. Common letters: R, O, L, E, S.

 Since S and O are very common, maybe ""ROLES"" is better? But we also have L and E in both.

 However, we already know R and E are in the word, so we are confirming their positions. The other letters (O, L, S) are common and we haven't tested them.

 I think ""ROLES"" is a good choice.

 But wait: what if the secret word has E at position 4? Then we get a '✓' for E. Similarly, if R is at position 1, we get a '✓'. 

 Alternatively, we might get '-' for R and E if they are in the word but not at these positions.

 Let's go with ""ROLES"".

 However, note: we are not forced to use R and E? Actually, we must use them because we know they are in the word? But the rules don't require that we use known letters? But if we don't use them, we won't get information about their positions. So it's better to use them.

 So I decide: ""ROLES""

 But let me check: is ""ROLES"" a valid word? Yes.

 Therefore, second guess: ""ROLES""

<guess>roles</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and N are **absent** (marked ""x"").
- R is **present** but not in position 2 (marked ""-"").
- E is **present** but not in position 5 (marked ""-"").

For the second guess:
- Must include **R** and **E** (since they are in the secret word).
- Avoid C, A, and N.
- Place R in a new position (not 2): options are 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- Place E in a new position (not 5): options are 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- Test new common letters (like S, O, L) to gather more information.

Chose **""ROLES""** because:
- R is at position 1 (new position for R).
- E is at position 4 (new position for E).
- Tests new letters: O, L, S (common consonants).
- Avoids C, A, N.

Also, we have to avoid A and C and N.\n        ""REBUS"" -> R E B U S -> but E is at position 2? and we don\'t know about B, U, S.\n\n   - R at position 3:\n        _ _ R E _ -> e.g., ""BORED"" -> but O is new? and D is new. Also, E is at position 4? which is allowed.\n\n   - R at position 4:\n        _ _ _ R E -> but E is at position 5? which is not allowed. So we cannot put E at 5. So if we put R at 4, then E must be at 1,2,3? but then we have two positions to fill? \n\n        Example: _ _ _ R _ and then put E at 1: ""E _ _ R _"", e.g., ""EVERY"" -> but duplicate E? and we don\'t know.\n\n   - R at position 5: \n        _ _ _ _ R, and E at one of 1,2,3,4. Example: ""LATER"" -> but L, T, E, R -> but E is at position 4? and R at 5. But we have to avoid A? ""LATER"" has A which is absent! So we cannot use A.\n\n        Without A: ""TIGER"" -> T I G E R -> E at position 4? and R at 5. But we don\'t know about T, I, G.\n\n Considering the above, let\'s try to choose a word that:\n\n   - Contains R and E (since we know they are in the word).\n   - Avoids C, A, N (absent letters).\n   - Puts R in a new position (not position 2) and E in a new position (not position 5).\n   - Uses common letters to maximize information.\n\n One candidate: ""ROGUE"" -> R at 1, O, G, U, E at 5? -> but E at 5 is not allowed. So skip.\n\n Another: ""RIPER"" -> duplicate R? and we don\'t know. Also, E at position 5? not allowed.\n\n How about ""ROBES""? -> R at 1, O, B, E at 4, S at 5. \n   E is at position 4 (allowed) and R at 1 (allowed). \n   Letters: R, O, B, E, S. We avoid C, A, N.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if O, B, S are in the word? This is a good test.\n\n Alternatively, ""RESTY"": R at 1, E at 2, S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5. \n   E is at position 2 (allowed) and R at 1 (allowed). \n   We test S, T, Y.\n\n Another common word: ""TRIED"" -> T, R, I, E, D. \n   R is at position 2? But wait, we know R is in the word but not at position 2. So we cannot put R at position 2 again? \n   Actually, we can put R at position 2? But the feedback told us that in the first guess R was at position 2 and that was wrong. So in the secret word, R is not at position 2. Therefore, in our new guess, if we put R at position 2, then we know it will be marked as \'-\' again? Because the secret word does not have R at position 2. But we already know that. So it\'s a waste of a position? \n\n   We want to test R in a new position to see if we can get a \'✓\'. So it\'s better to put R in a position we haven\'t tried and that is allowed (1,3,4,5). Similarly for E.\n\n In ""TRIED"", R is at position 2? That would be the same as the first guess? And we know it\'s not at 2. So we avoid that.\n\n How about ""DRIVE""? -> D, R, I, V, E. \n   R is at position 2? Again, same problem.\n\n We need to avoid position 2 for R.\n\n Let me try: ""PRICE"" -> but C is absent? We cannot use C.\n\n Without C: ""PRIDE"" -> P, R, I, D, E. \n   R is at position 2? Again, position 2 for R is not allowed? We know R is not at position 2 in the secret word. So if we put R at position 2, we will get a \'-\' again. But we are trying to find the correct position. So we should avoid position 2 for R.\n\n How about ""PERIL""? -> P, E, R, I, L. \n   R is at position 3 (which is allowed) and E at position 2 (which is allowed for E? yes, because E was only forbidden at position 5). \n   Letters: P, E, R, I, L. We avoid C, A, N.\n\n This seems good.\n\n Another candidate: ""BERYL"" -> B, E, R, Y, L. \n   E at position 2, R at position 3. \n   But we don\'t know about B, Y, L.\n\n However, note: we have already used E at position 2? But that\'s okay because we are testing.\n\n But wait: in the first guess, we had E at position 5 and got a \'-\'. Now we are putting E at position 2. If the secret word has E at position 2, we\'ll get a \'✓\'. If not, we\'ll get a \'-\'. Similarly for R at position 3.\n\n I think ""PERIL"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and tests new positions.\n\n Alternatively, ""ROUSE"": R at 1, O, U, S, E at 5? -> E at 5 is not allowed.\n\n How about ""ROLES"": R at 1, O, L, E at 4, S at 5? \n   E is at position 4? That\'s allowed. \n   So: R(1), O(2), L(3), E(4), S(5). \n\n This is also a candidate.\n\n But note: we have to avoid using the same letter in the same position if we know it\'s wrong? We don\'t have any other constraints.\n\n Let me compare:\n\n   ""PERIL"": tests positions: \n        P at 1 (new)\n        E at 2 (new for E, since E was at 5 before)\n        R at 3 (new for R, since R was at 2 before)\n        I at 4 (new)\n        L at 5 (new)\n\n   ""ROLES"": \n        R at 1 (new for R)\n        O at 2 (new)\n        L at 3 (new)\n        E at 4 (new for E, since E was at 5 before)\n        S at 5 (new)\n\n Both are valid. But we want to cover more common consonants. The letters in ""PERIL"": P, E, R, I, L. Common letters: E, R, L, I, P.\n The letters in ""ROLES"": R, O, L, E, S. Common letters: R, O, L, E, S.\n\n Since S and O are very common, maybe ""ROLES"" is better? But we also have L and E in both.\n\n However, we already know R and E are in the word, so we are confirming their positions. The other letters (O, L, S) are common and we haven\'t tested them.\n\n I think ""ROLES"" is a good choice.\n\n But wait: what if the secret word has E at position 4? Then we get a \'✓\' for E. Similarly, if R is at position 1, we get a \'✓\'. \n\n Alternatively, we might get \'-\' for R and E if they are in the word but not at these positions.\n\n Let\'s go with ""ROLES"".\n\n However, note: we are not forced to use R and E? Actually, we must use them because we know they are in the word? But the rules don\'t require that we use known letters? But if we don\'t use them, we won\'t get information about their positions. So it\'s better to use them.\n\n So I decide: ""ROLES""\n\n But let me check: is ""ROLES"" a valid word? Yes.\n\n Therefore, second guess: ""ROLES""\n\n<guess>roles</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, A, and N are **absent** (marked ""x"").\n- R is **present** but not in position 2 (marked ""-"").\n- E is **present** but not in position 5 (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Must include **R** and **E** (since they are in the secret word).\n- Avoid C, A, and N.\n- Place R in a new position (not 2): options are 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n- Place E in a new position (not 5): options are 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n- Test new common letters (like S, O, L) to gather more information.\n\nChose **""ROLES""** because:\n- R is at position 1 (new position for R).\n- E is at position 4 (new position for E).\n- Tests new letters: O, L, S (common consonants).\n- Avoids C, A, N.\n\n<guess>roles</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: roles -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) L(-) E(✓) S(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
  Meaning:
    - C, A, N are absent.
    - R is present (but not in position 2).
    - E is present (but not in position 5).

Guess 2: roles -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) L(-) E(✓) S(x)
  Meaning:
    - R is present but not in position 1 (because we put R at position 1 and got ""-"" meaning wrong position).
    - O is absent (since ""x"").
    - L is present but not in position 3 (because we put L at position 3 and got ""-"").
    - E is in the word and in the correct position (position 4) because ""✓"".
    - S is absent (since ""x"").

So from both guesses, we now know:

Absent letters: C, A, N, O, S
Present letters: R, E, L
  - E is fixed at position 4 (since we have E(✓) at position 4 in ""roles"").

Also, from Guess 1: E is present but not at position 5 -> but now we know E is at position 4, so that's consistent.

Positions we know:
  - E must be at position 4: so the word is _ _ _ E _

Constraints on R:
  - From Guess 1: R is not at position 2.
  - From Guess 2: R is not at position 1.

So R must be at position 3 or 5? (since position 2 and 1 are ruled out). The positions are 1,2,3,4,5. But position 4 is E, so R cannot be at position 4. Therefore, R must be at position 3 or 5.

Similarly, L is present but not at position 3 (from Guess 2). So L must be at position 1, 2, or 5? But note: if R is at position 5, then L can be at 1 or 2? Or vice versa.

We also have the present letters: R, E, L. And we know E is at 4.

Now, the word has 5 letters, so there are two more letters we don't know? But we only know 3 present letters? Actually, the word must have two more letters that we haven't discovered because the absent letters are C,A,N,O,S.

But note: we don't know if there are duplicates? We haven't encountered any duplicate feedback so far. The feedback for each letter is independent, and we haven't seen a letter appear twice in feedback? Actually, we only have one instance of R and one of E and one of L. So probably no duplicates.

So the secret word has 5 distinct letters: three we know (R, E, L) and two more that are not among the absent letters (C,A,N,O,S). 

The English alphabet has 26 letters. The absent letters are C,A,N,O,S. So the remaining possible letters are: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,M,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

We also know R is at position 3 or 5, and L is at position 1,2, or 5? But note: if R is at position 5, then position 5 is taken by R, so L cannot be at 5. Similarly, if R is at position 3, then L can be at 1,2,5? But position 5 is available.

So let's break it down.

Case 1: R at position 3, then L must be at 1,2, or 5? But we know L is not at position 3 (from ""roles"" feedback), which is already taken by R? But in this case, position 3 is R so L isn't there, which is consistent. So L can be at 1,2, or 5? However, we must assign L to one of these.

Case 2: R at position 5, then L can be at position 1 or 2? Because position 5 is taken by R, and position 3 is not L (from feedback) and position 4 is E.

Now, we need to form a 5-letter word that fits:

The pattern: _ _ _ E _  and we know:
  - E at 4.
  - R either at 3 or 5.
  - L at one of the remaining positions: if R at 3 then L at 1,2,5? But if R is at 3, then position 3 is R, so L must be at 1,2, or 5. But if we put L at 5, then position 5 is L? Then R would be at 3? That's fine.

Alternatively, if R is at 5, then position 5 is R, and L must be at 1 or 2.

So possible scenarios:

Scenario A: R at position 3, L at position 1: pattern: L _ R E _
Scenario B: R at position 3, L at position 2: pattern: _ L R E _
Scenario C: R at position 3, L at position 5: pattern: _ _ R E L
Scenario D: R at position 5, L at position 1: pattern: L _ _ E R
Scenario E: R at position 5, L at position 2: pattern: _ L _ E R

Now, we need to fill in the other positions with letters that are not absent (so not C, A, N, O, S) and not R,E,L (since we assume no duplicates?).

We should choose a word that tests as many of these possibilities as possible? But we have to pick one word.

Alternatively, we can try to find a word that fits one of these patterns and uses common letters.

Let's try to form words for each pattern:

Pattern A: L _ R E _
  We need a letter for position 2 and position 5.
  Example: LIBRE? but I and B? But we don't know if I or B is in the word? But LIBRE is a word? Yes, meaning free.

Pattern B: _ L R E _
  Example: BLARE? But B,L,A,R,E -> but A is absent? so invalid. 
  Another: FLARE? F,L,A,R,E -> A absent? Also invalid.
  Without A: GLARE? G,L,A,R,E -> A absent? Same.
  FLIER? FLIER is F,L,I,E,R -> positions: F at 1, L at 2, I at 3? But we need R at 3? But here I is at 3 and R at 5? That doesn't match because pattern must have R at 3: so pattern B: first letter unknown, then L at 2, R at 3, E at 4, then last letter.
  So: positions: 1: ?, 2: L, 3: R, 4: E, 5: ?
  Example words: 
      ULREE? not a word.
      PLIER? P,L,I,E,R -> but that would be P at 1, L at 2, I at 3? But we require R at 3? So if we have L at 2 and R at 3, then word must be ?LRE?
      PLRE? not 5 letters.
      ALERT? but A is absent.
      Let me think: ""ELVER"" -> E L V E R? But L at 2? And R at 5? And we have two E's? Not matching pattern B? 
      Another: ""BLUER"" -> B L U E R -> but that has U at 3? Not R at 3? 
      Actually, ""R"" is required at position 3? So ?LRE? 
      Words: 
        ""FLIER"" doesn't work because it has I at 3, not R.
        ""PLIER"" has I at 3? Not R.
        ""ALERT"" has A (absent) and E at position 2? Not L at 2? 
      I can't find a common word for pattern B? 

Pattern C: _ _ R E L
  Example: ""MOREL"" -> but M,O,R,E,L -> O is absent? So invalid.
          ""BAREL"" -> B,A,R,E,L -> A absent? invalid.
          ""QUREL"" -> not a word.
          ""TAREL"" -> T,A,R,E,L -> A absent? invalid.
          ""FIREL"" -> F,I,R,E,L -> which is F at 1, I at 2, R at 3, E at 4, L at 5. That matches? And letters: F,I,R,E,L. Absent letters? F and I are not absent? So ""FIREL"" is not a word? 
          ""Beryl"" is B,E,R,Y,L -> but that has E at position 2? Not position 4? And we have E fixed at position 4.

      For pattern C: positions 1 and 2 unknown, then R at 3, E at 4, L at 5. So ? ? R E L.
      Words: 
          ""CAREL"" -> C is absent? invalid.
          ""MIRREL"" -> not 5 letters.
          ""SOREL"" -> S,O,R,E,L -> O and S are absent? invalid.
          ""HAREL"" -> H,A,R,E,L -> A absent? invalid.
      I don't find an obvious word for pattern C? Maybe not common.

Pattern D: L _ _ E R
  Example: ""LIGER"" -> L,I,G,E,R -> which is L at 1, I at 2, G at 3, E at 4, R at 5. That fits.
  Another: ""LOWER"" -> L,O,W,E,R -> but O is absent? invalid.
  ""LUBER"" -> not a word? 
  ""LIBER"" -> L,I,B,E,R -> that's a word? It exists? meaning free? Yes, LIBER.

Pattern E: _ L _ E R
  Example: ""BLUER"" -> B,L,U,E,R -> but U at position 3? And R at 5? So pattern: B, L, U, E, R -> position 1: B, 2: L, 3: U, 4: E, 5: R. That's pattern E? Yes.
  Another: ""PLIER""? P,L,I,E,R -> but I at 3? same.

But note: pattern D and E are similar? Pattern D has L at 1, pattern E has L at 2.

So we have:
  Pattern A: L _ R E _ -> e.g., LIBRE? But LIBRE has L at 1, I at 2, R at 3, E at 4? And the last position? LIBRE is 5 letters? L-I-B-R-E? That’s positions: L at 1, I at 2, B at 3, R at 4? Actually, that doesn't fit because we require R at 3? 

  Correction: For pattern A: L at 1, then letter at 2, then R at 3, E at 4, then letter at 5.
      LIBRE: L (1), I (2), B (3), R (4)? -> doesn't work because R is at position 4? But we need R at 3? 
      Actually, if we define the pattern: positions: 1: L, 2: ?, 3: R, 4: E, 5: ?.
      Example: ""LIBER""? L,I,B,E,R -> that has R at position 5? Not at 3? 
      To have R at 3: ""LURE?"" -> L,U,R,E? That's only 4 letters? 
      ""LURED"" -> L, U, R, E, D -> positions: L at 1, U at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5. That fits? And D is not absent? 

  So ""LURED"" is a word? Yes.

  Pattern A: L, U, R, E, D -> word ""LURED"".

Pattern D: L,I,G,E,R -> ""LIGER"" is a word? Yes, meaning a cross between lion and tiger? But also ""TIGER"" might be? But TIGER has T at ? T,I,G,E,R -> which is pattern E? 

But we cannot use A, O, S, N, C.

So possible words we identified:
  Pattern A: ""LURED"" -> L,U,R,E,D
  Pattern D: ""LIBER"" -> L,I,B,E,R   [but note: R at position 5?] -> pattern: L at 1, I at 2, B at 3, E at 4, R at 5. But we have E at 4? Correct. And R at 5? And L at 1? This is pattern D: L _ _ E R -> so _ in position 2 and 3: so I and B? Then for pattern D: we have L, ?, ?, E, R -> positions: 1:L, 2:?, 3:?, 4:E, 5:R.

Actually, pattern D: L _ _ E R -> two letters in the middle.

Similarly, pattern E: _ L _ E R -> one letter at start and one in the middle.

So ""LIBER"" is pattern D: L at 1, I at 2, B at 3, E at 4, R at 5? Then yes? That's L (1), I (2), B (3), E (4), R (5). So matches pattern D.

But note: pattern D requires L at 1 and R at 5? Exactly.

Similarly, pattern A: ""LURED"" -> L at 1, U at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5? So in pattern A we have R at 3? So that is scenario A: R at 3, L at 1? Yes.

But we also have pattern E: ""BLUER"" -> B,L,U,E,R -> but U is at 3? And L at 2? So it matches pattern E? But we have R at 5? And E at 4? So _ L _ E R: B at 1, L at 2, U at 3, E at 4, R at 5? So exactly.

But now we have: 
  Scenario A: LURED (if it is valid)
  Scenario D: LIBER, LURER (but duplicate R? we don't know? and LURER may not be a word? Probably not) -> LIGER?
  Scenario E: BLUER, FLIER, PLIER? But FLIER and PLIER have I at 3? And they end with R? PLIER has P, L, I, E, R? Yes? That's pattern E: P at 1, L at 2, I at 3, E at 4, R at 5.

Now, with the feedback we don't have duplicates? So we can assume no duplicates? 

We need to choose a third guess that helps us differentiate the scenarios.

But note: we know E is at 4? And R is at 3 or 5? And L is at 1, 2, or 5? But depending on R.

We can try to choose a word that covers some of these possibilities and tests common letters.

However, we know from the present letters: R, E, L and E fixed at 4. And we need to find two more letters? 

We can try to pick a word that includes L and R? And E? And tests positions? But we have to choose one.

But note: we also have constraints:

  - R cannot be at position 1 or 2 (from past feedback). 
  - L cannot be at position 3 (from Guess 2).

And we know E is at 4.

So let's try to find a word that fits the pattern that might be the solution? Or one that gives us more information.

But we don't have enough constraints to pin down the word? We have five possible patterns? 

Alternatively, we might guess a word that tests one of the possibilities? For example, if we guess ""LURED"", that would tell us if the pattern A is correct.

But maybe we should choose a word that doesn't depend on the unknown letters? But we have to.

The known present letters are R, E, L? And two more are unknown? So if we guess a word that includes R, E, L and two new letters that we don't know? We can test them.

But we should avoid absent letters: C, A, N, O, S.

So let me propose a word that tests the position of R, L and includes E at 4? And two new letters.

Since E must be at 4, we can try to fix that.

The word must be * * E * ? With E at position 4.

And it must contain R and L? And avoid absent letters.

So structure: position 4: E, and positions 1,2,3,5: to be filled? With two of them being R and L? And the other two new letters? But we don't have to assign both R and L? Actually, we must because they are in the word.

We also know:
  R cannot be at 1 or 2? -> so R must be at 3 or 5? because position 1 and 2 are forbidden for R? And position 4 is E.

  Similarly, L cannot be at 3? -> so L must be at 1, 2, or 5? but if R is at 5, then L can be at 1 or 2? and if R is at 3, then L at 1,2,5? 

So we can consider:

Option 1: Put R at position 3? 
  Then word: _ _ R E _ ? And L must be at 1, 2, or 5? But we also need two more letters? 
  Let’s pick common letters? For positions 1 and 2: we can pick common consonants or vowels? For position 5: one letter.

  We need to choose a word that has L at either 1, 2, or 5 and R at 3.

  Example: word with L at 1: pattern L _ R E ? 
      L? R E ? -> letters: L at 1, R at 3, E at 4, and positions 2 and 5: two new letters.
      Example: ""LURED"" (as before): L,U,R,E,D -> but U and D? 
      Or ""LIBER"" wouldn't work because R is at 4? Or ""LIBER"" has R at 5, not at 3? 

  Actually, ""LIBER"" has R at 5? Can we find a word like L? R E ?? 
      ""LAREE"" -> A absent? invalid.
      ""LIRE?"" not 5 letters.
      ""LURED"" is one.

Option 2: Put R at position 5?
  Then word: _ _ _ E R? And L must be at 1 or 2? Because it cannot be at 3? And 4 is E, and 5 is R? So L must be at 1 or 2.

  Example: 
      If L at 1: L ? ? E R -> e.g., ""LIBER"": L,I,B,E,R -> which is pattern D.
      If L at 2: ? L ? E R -> e.g., ""BLUER"" (if not absent letters) but U is acceptable? Or ""PLIER"": P,L,I,E,R? Or ""ALERT"" with A absent? Not.

But in our case, ""BLUER"" has letter B,L,U,E,R? B and U are not absent? So okay? And ""PLIER"" has P,L,I,E,R.

To maximize new letters, I am considering trying ""LURED"". 

But first, suppose we guess ""LURED"":
  That covers:
    L at 1? So if L is at 1? And R at 3? And E at 4? 
  The word is L,U,R,E,D.

This would be matching scenario A: R at position 3, L at position 1? 

If it is the secret word, we win? But we are on the third guess.

If not, we get feedback? 

Alternatively, if we want to test both R positions, we can try a word that has R at 5? and L at 1? But E at 4? For example, ""LIBER"" (but we have to make sure the other letters are not absent?).

But note: we have two possible groupings:

We can split the possibilities by choosing a word that forces differentiation.

Or, we can try to find a word that fits one of the scenarios and uses common letters? 

Maybe ""TRIBE"" but T,R,I,B,E -> and T,R,I,B,E at: T at 1, R at 2? But R cannot be at 2? so we must avoid.

Another idea: we know E is at 4? Let's choose a word that puts L and R in permitted positions and tests new common letters? For example, include T.

What is common? Let's try: Pattern: _ _ _ E R? And put L at 2? Then it becomes: ? L ? E R.

And choose common letters: B and I? That would be ""BLIER""? B,L,I,E,R? Is that a word? Blier means more blue? Not common? ""PLIER"" is more common.

Or ""S?"" but S is absent.

How about ""GLUER""? G and U? But that's pattern? G,L,U,E,R -> which is _ L _ E R? So L at 2, U at 3? And R at 5? E at 4? So if we guess ""GLUER""? Or ""G"" may be okay? Then the word is G,L,U,E,R.

But let me check: absent letters are C,A,O,N,S? So G, U are okay.

But I don't know if ""GLUER"" is common? Also, what about ""TILER""? T,I,L,E,R -> T at 1, I at 2, L at 3? But L at 3? We know L cannot be at position 3? Because in ""roles"", L was at position 3 and we got '-', meaning L is in the word but not at position 3? So we cannot put L at 3.

So we must avoid L at 3? In ""TILER"", L is at 3? Which is not allowed? Because feedback said L in ""roles"" at position 3 got '-', so it cannot be at 3 in the secret word.

Similarly, we must avoid L at 3? So any guess we make, if we put L at 3? It would be marked as '-', which we already know? So we should avoid wasting a position? Unless we want to confirm.

But we already know it? So it's redundant.

So back to our options:

I will choose to guess ""LURED"" to test pattern A? because it has L at 1, R at 3, E at 4? And tests U and D? Both new letters? 

If it's not the word, we get feedback: 

  If ""LURED"" is the secret we win.

  Otherwise:
  We might get:
      L: ✓ or -? If L is at position 1? Then we get ✓? 
      U: if U is in the word? We get - or x? 
      R: we put at 3? So if R is at position 3? Then ✓? We know R is either at 3 or 5? 
      E: ✓ because position 4.
      D: ...

But if the feedback shows:
  If L is not at position 1? But then we get '-', meaning L is in the word but not at 1? 

Similarly, if R is not at position 3? We get '-'? But we know R must be at 3 or 5? If not at 3, then it must be at 5.

And U and D would tell us.

But we have only 6 guesses? So we can be strategic.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that has E at 4? And doesn't commit to a particular scenario? But still tests L at 1 or 2? 

For example, put L at 1? and not fix R at 3? Because R could be at 5? Then if L is at 1? We get ✓ for L? 

But the word should have R at either 3 or 5? Let's try to guess a word that has L at 1? E at 4? And R at 5? For example, ""LIBER""?

If we guess ""LIBER"":

  Pattern: L at 1, R at 5? E at 4? Then if the secret word fits pattern D? However, if the secret word is ""LURED"", then ""LIBER"" would be: 
      L: ✓ (because both at 1)
      I: we don't know? 
      B: absent? 
      E: ✓ at 4.
      R: at 5? But in ""LURED"", R is at 3? So R at 5 in ""LIBER"" may be marked as 'x' if the secret word is ""LURED""? But no: R is in the word? And in ""LURED"", R is at 3, so in ""LIBER"", R at 5 would be present but not at 5, so '-', meaning the secret word has R but not at 5? That would tell us that R is not at 5? So then it must be at 3.

Then we know R is at 3? And L at 1? So pattern A? Then next guess ""LURED"".

But that uses two guesses.

But if we guess ""LURED"" now, and if it's correct, we win in three? If not, we still have information.

I think let's go with ""LURED"" for the third guess.

So the guessed word: ""lured""

But in uppercase? The rules say ""5-letter English word"" and previous guesses are in lowercase? So lowercase.

<guess>lured</guess>

Let me confirm: ""LURED"" has L at 1, U at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5? And positions: 
  L at 1 -> we don't know if L is at 1? 
  U at 2 -> new
  R at 3 -> we are testing if R is at 3?
  E at 4 -> known correct
  D at 5 -> new

This guess will give us feedback on L's position (if it is at 1? or not) and R's position (if at 3? or not) and also tell us about U and D.

If we get:
  L(?), U(?), R(?), E(✓), D(?)

And compare to the known present letters? 

So it's a good test.
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

- **C, A, N, O, S** are **absent** (marked ""x"").
- **E** is **correctly placed at position 4** (marked ""✓"" in ""roles"").
- **R** is **present** but not at position 1 or 2.
- **L** is **present** but not at position 3.

Deductions:
- E must be at position 4 (secret word pattern: \_ \_ \_ E \_).
- R must be at position 3 or 5 (since positions 1 and 2 are ruled out).
- L must be at position 1, 2, or 5 (since position 3 is ruled out).
- The secret word contains exactly 5 distinct letters (no duplicates indicated in feedback).
- Absent letters (C, A, N, O, S) must be excluded.

For the third guess, **""LURED""** is chosen because:
- Fits letter/position constraints: E at position 4.
- Tests R at position 3 and L at position 1.
- Uses new common letters (U, D) to gather additional information.
- Optimizes potential to confirm R and L positions while adhering to rules.

<guess>lured</guess>",lured,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
  Meaning:
    - C, A, N are absent.
    - R is present (but not in position 2).
    - E is present (but not in position 5).

Guess 2: roles -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) L(-) E(✓) S(x)
  Meaning:
    - R is present but not in position 1 (because we put R at position 1 and got ""-"" meaning wrong position).
    - O is absent (since ""x"").
    - L is present but not in position 3 (because we put L at position 3 and got ""-"").
    - E is in the word and in the correct position (position 4) because ""✓"".
    - S is absent (since ""x"").

So from both guesses, we now know:

Absent letters: C, A, N, O, S
Present letters: R, E, L
  - E is fixed at position 4 (since we have E(✓) at position 4 in ""roles"").

Also, from Guess 1: E is present but not at position 5 -> but now we know E is at position 4, so that's consistent.

Positions we know:
  - E must be at position 4: so the word is _ _ _ E _

Constraints on R:
  - From Guess 1: R is not at position 2.
  - From Guess 2: R is not at position 1.

So R must be at position 3 or 5? (since position 2 and 1 are ruled out). The positions are 1,2,3,4,5. But position 4 is E, so R cannot be at position 4. Therefore, R must be at position 3 or 5.

Similarly, L is present but not at position 3 (from Guess 2). So L must be at position 1, 2, or 5? But note: if R is at position 5, then L can be at 1 or 2? Or vice versa.

We also have the present letters: R, E, L. And we know E is at 4.

Now, the word has 5 letters, so there are two more letters we don't know? But we only know 3 present letters? Actually, the word must have two more letters that we haven't discovered because the absent letters are C,A,N,O,S.

But note: we don't know if there are duplicates? We haven't encountered any duplicate feedback so far. The feedback for each letter is independent, and we haven't seen a letter appear twice in feedback? Actually, we only have one instance of R and one of E and one of L. So probably no duplicates.

So the secret word has 5 distinct letters: three we know (R, E, L) and two more that are not among the absent letters (C,A,N,O,S). 

The English alphabet has 26 letters. The absent letters are C,A,N,O,S. So the remaining possible letters are: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,M,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

We also know R is at position 3 or 5, and L is at position 1,2, or 5? But note: if R is at position 5, then position 5 is taken by R, so L cannot be at 5. Similarly, if R is at position 3, then L can be at 1,2,5? But position 5 is available.

So let's break it down.

Case 1: R at position 3, then L must be at 1,2, or 5? But we know L is not at position 3 (from ""roles"" feedback), which is already taken by R? But in this case, position 3 is R so L isn't there, which is consistent. So L can be at 1,2, or 5? However, we must assign L to one of these.

Case 2: R at position 5, then L can be at position 1 or 2? Because position 5 is taken by R, and position 3 is not L (from feedback) and position 4 is E.

Now, we need to form a 5-letter word that fits:

The pattern: _ _ _ E _  and we know:
  - E at 4.
  - R either at 3 or 5.
  - L at one of the remaining positions: if R at 3 then L at 1,2,5? But if R is at 3, then position 3 is R, so L must be at 1,2, or 5. But if we put L at 5, then position 5 is L? Then R would be at 3? That's fine.

Alternatively, if R is at 5, then position 5 is R, and L must be at 1 or 2.

So possible scenarios:

Scenario A: R at position 3, L at position 1: pattern: L _ R E _
Scenario B: R at position 3, L at position 2: pattern: _ L R E _
Scenario C: R at position 3, L at position 5: pattern: _ _ R E L
Scenario D: R at position 5, L at position 1: pattern: L _ _ E R
Scenario E: R at position 5, L at position 2: pattern: _ L _ E R

Now, we need to fill in the other positions with letters that are not absent (so not C, A, N, O, S) and not R,E,L (since we assume no duplicates?).

We should choose a word that tests as many of these possibilities as possible? But we have to pick one word.

Alternatively, we can try to find a word that fits one of these patterns and uses common letters.

Let's try to form words for each pattern:

Pattern A: L _ R E _
  We need a letter for position 2 and position 5.
  Example: LIBRE? but I and B? But we don't know if I or B is in the word? But LIBRE is a word? Yes, meaning free.

Pattern B: _ L R E _
  Example: BLARE? But B,L,A,R,E -> but A is absent? so invalid. 
  Another: FLARE? F,L,A,R,E -> A absent? Also invalid.
  Without A: GLARE? G,L,A,R,E -> A absent? Same.
  FLIER? FLIER is F,L,I,E,R -> positions: F at 1, L at 2, I at 3? But we need R at 3? But here I is at 3 and R at 5? That doesn't match because pattern must have R at 3: so pattern B: first letter unknown, then L at 2, R at 3, E at 4, then last letter.
  So: positions: 1: ?, 2: L, 3: R, 4: E, 5: ?
  Example words: 
      ULREE? not a word.
      PLIER? P,L,I,E,R -> but that would be P at 1, L at 2, I at 3? But we require R at 3? So if we have L at 2 and R at 3, then word must be ?LRE?
      PLRE? not 5 letters.
      ALERT? but A is absent.
      Let me think: ""ELVER"" -> E L V E R? But L at 2? And R at 5? And we have two E's? Not matching pattern B? 
      Another: ""BLUER"" -> B L U E R -> but that has U at 3? Not R at 3? 
      Actually, ""R"" is required at position 3? So ?LRE? 
      Words: 
        ""FLIER"" doesn't work because it has I at 3, not R.
        ""PLIER"" has I at 3? Not R.
        ""ALERT"" has A (absent) and E at position 2? Not L at 2? 
      I can't find a common word for pattern B? 

Pattern C: _ _ R E L
  Example: ""MOREL"" -> but M,O,R,E,L -> O is absent? So invalid.
          ""BAREL"" -> B,A,R,E,L -> A absent? invalid.
          ""QUREL"" -> not a word.
          ""TAREL"" -> T,A,R,E,L -> A absent? invalid.
          ""FIREL"" -> F,I,R,E,L -> which is F at 1, I at 2, R at 3, E at 4, L at 5. That matches? And letters: F,I,R,E,L. Absent letters? F and I are not absent? So ""FIREL"" is not a word? 
          ""Beryl"" is B,E,R,Y,L -> but that has E at position 2? Not position 4? And we have E fixed at position 4.

      For pattern C: positions 1 and 2 unknown, then R at 3, E at 4, L at 5. So ? ? R E L.
      Words: 
          ""CAREL"" -> C is absent? invalid.
          ""MIRREL"" -> not 5 letters.
          ""SOREL"" -> S,O,R,E,L -> O and S are absent? invalid.
          ""HAREL"" -> H,A,R,E,L -> A absent? invalid.
      I don't find an obvious word for pattern C? Maybe not common.

Pattern D: L _ _ E R
  Example: ""LIGER"" -> L,I,G,E,R -> which is L at 1, I at 2, G at 3, E at 4, R at 5. That fits.
  Another: ""LOWER"" -> L,O,W,E,R -> but O is absent? invalid.
  ""LUBER"" -> not a word? 
  ""LIBER"" -> L,I,B,E,R -> that's a word? It exists? meaning free? Yes, LIBER.

Pattern E: _ L _ E R
  Example: ""BLUER"" -> B,L,U,E,R -> but U at position 3? And R at 5? So pattern: B, L, U, E, R -> position 1: B, 2: L, 3: U, 4: E, 5: R. That's pattern E? Yes.
  Another: ""PLIER""? P,L,I,E,R -> but I at 3? same.

But note: pattern D and E are similar? Pattern D has L at 1, pattern E has L at 2.

So we have:
  Pattern A: L _ R E _ -> e.g., LIBRE? But LIBRE has L at 1, I at 2, R at 3, E at 4? And the last position? LIBRE is 5 letters? L-I-B-R-E? That’s positions: L at 1, I at 2, B at 3, R at 4? Actually, that doesn't fit because we require R at 3? 

  Correction: For pattern A: L at 1, then letter at 2, then R at 3, E at 4, then letter at 5.
      LIBRE: L (1), I (2), B (3), R (4)? -> doesn't work because R is at position 4? But we need R at 3? 
      Actually, if we define the pattern: positions: 1: L, 2: ?, 3: R, 4: E, 5: ?.
      Example: ""LIBER""? L,I,B,E,R -> that has R at position 5? Not at 3? 
      To have R at 3: ""LURE?"" -> L,U,R,E? That's only 4 letters? 
      ""LURED"" -> L, U, R, E, D -> positions: L at 1, U at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5. That fits? And D is not absent? 

  So ""LURED"" is a word? Yes.

  Pattern A: L, U, R, E, D -> word ""LURED"".

Pattern D: L,I,G,E,R -> ""LIGER"" is a word? Yes, meaning a cross between lion and tiger? But also ""TIGER"" might be? But TIGER has T at ? T,I,G,E,R -> which is pattern E? 

But we cannot use A, O, S, N, C.

So possible words we identified:
  Pattern A: ""LURED"" -> L,U,R,E,D
  Pattern D: ""LIBER"" -> L,I,B,E,R   [but note: R at position 5?] -> pattern: L at 1, I at 2, B at 3, E at 4, R at 5. But we have E at 4? Correct. And R at 5? And L at 1? This is pattern D: L _ _ E R -> so _ in position 2 and 3: so I and B? Then for pattern D: we have L, ?, ?, E, R -> positions: 1:L, 2:?, 3:?, 4:E, 5:R.

Actually, pattern D: L _ _ E R -> two letters in the middle.

Similarly, pattern E: _ L _ E R -> one letter at start and one in the middle.

So ""LIBER"" is pattern D: L at 1, I at 2, B at 3, E at 4, R at 5? Then yes? That's L (1), I (2), B (3), E (4), R (5). So matches pattern D.

But note: pattern D requires L at 1 and R at 5? Exactly.

Similarly, pattern A: ""LURED"" -> L at 1, U at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5? So in pattern A we have R at 3? So that is scenario A: R at 3, L at 1? Yes.

But we also have pattern E: ""BLUER"" -> B,L,U,E,R -> but U is at 3? And L at 2? So it matches pattern E? But we have R at 5? And E at 4? So _ L _ E R: B at 1, L at 2, U at 3, E at 4, R at 5? So exactly.

But now we have: 
  Scenario A: LURED (if it is valid)
  Scenario D: LIBER, LURER (but duplicate R? we don't know? and LURER may not be a word? Probably not) -> LIGER?
  Scenario E: BLUER, FLIER, PLIER? But FLIER and PLIER have I at 3? And they end with R? PLIER has P, L, I, E, R? Yes? That's pattern E: P at 1, L at 2, I at 3, E at 4, R at 5.

Now, with the feedback we don't have duplicates? So we can assume no duplicates? 

We need to choose a third guess that helps us differentiate the scenarios.

But note: we know E is at 4? And R is at 3 or 5? And L is at 1, 2, or 5? But depending on R.

We can try to choose a word that covers some of these possibilities and tests common letters.

However, we know from the present letters: R, E, L and E fixed at 4. And we need to find two more letters? 

We can try to pick a word that includes L and R? And E? And tests positions? But we have to choose one.

But note: we also have constraints:

  - R cannot be at position 1 or 2 (from past feedback). 
  - L cannot be at position 3 (from Guess 2).

And we know E is at 4.

So let's try to find a word that fits the pattern that might be the solution? Or one that gives us more information.

But we don't have enough constraints to pin down the word? We have five possible patterns? 

Alternatively, we might guess a word that tests one of the possibilities? For example, if we guess ""LURED"", that would tell us if the pattern A is correct.

But maybe we should choose a word that doesn't depend on the unknown letters? But we have to.

The known present letters are R, E, L? And two more are unknown? So if we guess a word that includes R, E, L and two new letters that we don't know? We can test them.

But we should avoid absent letters: C, A, N, O, S.

So let me propose a word that tests the position of R, L and includes E at 4? And two new letters.

Since E must be at 4, we can try to fix that.

The word must be * * E * ? With E at position 4.

And it must contain R and L? And avoid absent letters.

So structure: position 4: E, and positions 1,2,3,5: to be filled? With two of them being R and L? And the other two new letters? But we don't have to assign both R and L? Actually, we must because they are in the word.

We also know:
  R cannot be at 1 or 2? -> so R must be at 3 or 5? because position 1 and 2 are forbidden for R? And position 4 is E.

  Similarly, L cannot be at 3? -> so L must be at 1, 2, or 5? but if R is at 5, then L can be at 1 or 2? and if R is at 3, then L at 1,2,5? 

So we can consider:

Option 1: Put R at position 3? 
  Then word: _ _ R E _ ? And L must be at 1, 2, or 5? But we also need two more letters? 
  Let’s pick common letters? For positions 1 and 2: we can pick common consonants or vowels? For position 5: one letter.

  We need to choose a word that has L at either 1, 2, or 5 and R at 3.

  Example: word with L at 1: pattern L _ R E ? 
      L? R E ? -> letters: L at 1, R at 3, E at 4, and positions 2 and 5: two new letters.
      Example: ""LURED"" (as before): L,U,R,E,D -> but U and D? 
      Or ""LIBER"" wouldn't work because R is at 4? Or ""LIBER"" has R at 5, not at 3? 

  Actually, ""LIBER"" has R at 5? Can we find a word like L? R E ?? 
      ""LAREE"" -> A absent? invalid.
      ""LIRE?"" not 5 letters.
      ""LURED"" is one.

Option 2: Put R at position 5?
  Then word: _ _ _ E R? And L must be at 1 or 2? Because it cannot be at 3? And 4 is E, and 5 is R? So L must be at 1 or 2.

  Example: 
      If L at 1: L ? ? E R -> e.g., ""LIBER"": L,I,B,E,R -> which is pattern D.
      If L at 2: ? L ? E R -> e.g., ""BLUER"" (if not absent letters) but U is acceptable? Or ""PLIER"": P,L,I,E,R? Or ""ALERT"" with A absent? Not.

But in our case, ""BLUER"" has letter B,L,U,E,R? B and U are not absent? So okay? And ""PLIER"" has P,L,I,E,R.

To maximize new letters, I am considering trying ""LURED"". 

But first, suppose we guess ""LURED"":
  That covers:
    L at 1? So if L is at 1? And R at 3? And E at 4? 
  The word is L,U,R,E,D.

This would be matching scenario A: R at position 3, L at position 1? 

If it is the secret word, we win? But we are on the third guess.

If not, we get feedback? 

Alternatively, if we want to test both R positions, we can try a word that has R at 5? and L at 1? But E at 4? For example, ""LIBER"" (but we have to make sure the other letters are not absent?).

But note: we have two possible groupings:

We can split the possibilities by choosing a word that forces differentiation.

Or, we can try to find a word that fits one of the scenarios and uses common letters? 

Maybe ""TRIBE"" but T,R,I,B,E -> and T,R,I,B,E at: T at 1, R at 2? But R cannot be at 2? so we must avoid.

Another idea: we know E is at 4? Let's choose a word that puts L and R in permitted positions and tests new common letters? For example, include T.

What is common? Let's try: Pattern: _ _ _ E R? And put L at 2? Then it becomes: ? L ? E R.

And choose common letters: B and I? That would be ""BLIER""? B,L,I,E,R? Is that a word? Blier means more blue? Not common? ""PLIER"" is more common.

Or ""S?"" but S is absent.

How about ""GLUER""? G and U? But that's pattern? G,L,U,E,R -> which is _ L _ E R? So L at 2, U at 3? And R at 5? E at 4? So if we guess ""GLUER""? Or ""G"" may be okay? Then the word is G,L,U,E,R.

But let me check: absent letters are C,A,O,N,S? So G, U are okay.

But I don't know if ""GLUER"" is common? Also, what about ""TILER""? T,I,L,E,R -> T at 1, I at 2, L at 3? But L at 3? We know L cannot be at position 3? Because in ""roles"", L was at position 3 and we got '-', meaning L is in the word but not at position 3? So we cannot put L at 3.

So we must avoid L at 3? In ""TILER"", L is at 3? Which is not allowed? Because feedback said L in ""roles"" at position 3 got '-', so it cannot be at 3 in the secret word.

Similarly, we must avoid L at 3? So any guess we make, if we put L at 3? It would be marked as '-', which we already know? So we should avoid wasting a position? Unless we want to confirm.

But we already know it? So it's redundant.

So back to our options:

I will choose to guess ""LURED"" to test pattern A? because it has L at 1, R at 3, E at 4? And tests U and D? Both new letters? 

If it's not the word, we get feedback: 

  If ""LURED"" is the secret we win.

  Otherwise:
  We might get:
      L: ✓ or -? If L is at position 1? Then we get ✓? 
      U: if U is in the word? We get - or x? 
      R: we put at 3? So if R is at position 3? Then ✓? We know R is either at 3 or 5? 
      E: ✓ because position 4.
      D: ...

But if the feedback shows:
  If L is not at position 1? But then we get '-', meaning L is in the word but not at 1? 

Similarly, if R is not at position 3? We get '-'? But we know R must be at 3 or 5? If not at 3, then it must be at 5.

And U and D would tell us.

But we have only 6 guesses? So we can be strategic.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that has E at 4? And doesn't commit to a particular scenario? But still tests L at 1 or 2? 

For example, put L at 1? and not fix R at 3? Because R could be at 5? Then if L is at 1? We get ✓ for L? 

But the word should have R at either 3 or 5? Let's try to guess a word that has L at 1? E at 4? And R at 5? For example, ""LIBER""?

If we guess ""LIBER"":

  Pattern: L at 1, R at 5? E at 4? Then if the secret word fits pattern D? However, if the secret word is ""LURED"", then ""LIBER"" would be: 
      L: ✓ (because both at 1)
      I: we don't know? 
      B: absent? 
      E: ✓ at 4.
      R: at 5? But in ""LURED"", R is at 3? So R at 5 in ""LIBER"" may be marked as 'x' if the secret word is ""LURED""? But no: R is in the word? And in ""LURED"", R is at 3, so in ""LIBER"", R at 5 would be present but not at 5, so '-', meaning the secret word has R but not at 5? That would tell us that R is not at 5? So then it must be at 3.

Then we know R is at 3? And L at 1? So pattern A? Then next guess ""LURED"".

But that uses two guesses.

But if we guess ""LURED"" now, and if it's correct, we win in three? If not, we still have information.

I think let's go with ""LURED"" for the third guess.

So the guessed word: ""lured""

But in uppercase? The rules say ""5-letter English word"" and previous guesses are in lowercase? So lowercase.

<guess>lured</guess>

Let me confirm: ""LURED"" has L at 1, U at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5? And positions: 
  L at 1 -> we don't know if L is at 1? 
  U at 2 -> new
  R at 3 -> we are testing if R is at 3?
  E at 4 -> known correct
  D at 5 -> new

This guess will give us feedback on L's position (if it is at 1? or not) and R's position (if at 3? or not) and also tell us about U and D.

If we get:
  L(?), U(?), R(?), E(✓), D(?)

And compare to the known present letters? 

So it's a good test.After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

- **C, A, N, O, S** are **absent** (marked ""x"").
- **E** is **correctly placed at position 4** (marked ""✓"" in ""roles"").
- **R** is **present** but not at position 1 or 2.
- **L** is **present** but not at position 3.

Deductions:
- E must be at position 4 (secret word pattern: \_ \_ \_ E \_).
- R must be at position 3 or 5 (since positions 1 and 2 are ruled out).
- L must be at position 1, 2, or 5 (since position 3 is ruled out).
- The secret word contains exactly 5 distinct letters (no duplicates indicated in feedback).
- Absent letters (C, A, N, O, S) must be excluded.

For the third guess, **""LURED""** is chosen because:
- Fits letter/position constraints: E at position 4.
- Tests R at position 3 and L at position 1.
- Uses new common letters (U, D) to gather additional information.
- Optimizes potential to confirm R and L positions while adhering to rules.",Guess 3: lured -> FEEDBACK: L(-) U(x) R(-) E(✓) D(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,FLYER,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R was in position 2 and E in position 5 of ""crane"", so in the secret word:
     R is not at position 2.
     E is not at position 5.

 - The letters C, A, N are not in the word at all.

 We also know the secret word is 5 letters.

 Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
   - Does not contain C, A, N (since they are absent).
   - Includes R and E (since they are present) but in different positions than in the first guess.
   - We might also want to include other common letters to test.

 Let's think about the positions:
   In ""crane"", the positions are:
     1: C (absent)
     2: R (present but wrong position) -> so R must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? Actually, no: we know it's not at 2, but it could be at 1,3,4,5? However, note that in the feedback, we have a '-' for R meaning it is in the word but not at position 2. Similarly, E is not at position 5.

 But note: the feedback doesn't tell us that R cannot be at position 1,3,4,5? Actually, it can be at any position except 2. Similarly, E can be at any position except 5.

 However, we must also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But the rules don't specify, so we assume no duplicates unless feedback suggests otherwise. But in this feedback, we don't have any duplicates.

 Now, for the second guess, we want to try to place R and E in new positions and also test new letters.

 We know the word has R and E. Let's try to think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N.

 Also, we want to cover more common letters. Common consonants besides R: T, L, S, etc. Common vowels: we have E, and we know A is absent, so other vowels: O, I, U? But we have E already.

 Let's try to form a word:

 We know:
   Position 1: cannot be C (absent) and we don't know about others. But we can try to put R at position 1? Or E? Or a new letter.

 Since R is in the word and not at position 2, let's try putting R at position 1. And E is not at position 5, so let's put E at position 4? Or 3? We have to choose.

 Also, we need to avoid positions that we know are wrong for R and E? Actually, we only know that R is not at 2 and E is not at 5. So:

   For R: allowed positions: 1, 3, 4, 5.
   For E: allowed positions: 1, 2, 3, 4.

 We can try to put R at position 1 and E at position 3? Or position 4? 

 Let's think of words that start with R and have E in the middle.

 Example: ""REBEL"" -> but that has E at position 2 and 4? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have to avoid A and C and N.

 But note: we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. The rules don't forbid it, but we haven't seen any feedback suggesting duplicates. So we should avoid assuming duplicates until necessary.

 Alternatively, let's try a word that has R at position 1 and E at position 4? 

 Example: ""ROUTE"" -> but we don't know if O and U and T are in the word? Also, we have E at position 5? But wait, in ""ROUTE"", E is at position 5, which we know is not allowed for E (because in the first guess E was at position 5 and got a '-', meaning E is in the word but not at position 5). So we cannot put E at position 5.

 So we need E at positions 1,2,3, or 4.

 Let me try: ""RESTY"" -> R at 1, E at 2, S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5. But we don't know if S, T, Y are in the word? And we are testing new letters.

 However, note that in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and now we are putting R at position 1. That's allowed because the feedback only said R is not at position 2.

 Similarly, E was at position 5 and now we put it at position 2.

 But wait: what if the word has two R's? We don't know. But we can try.

 Alternatively, we can avoid putting R at position 1 and try a different position? But we have to test.

 Another idea: we know the word has R and E. We can try to put R at position 3 and E at position 1? For example: ""PERKY"" -> P, E, R, K, Y.

 But we don't know if P, K, Y are in the word? And we are avoiding C, A, N.

 However, we have to test new letters.

 Let me list some words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N:

   - R at position 1: 
        R E _ _ _ -> e.g., ""RESET"" (but duplicate E? and we don't know if duplicates are allowed) -> but we don't want to assume duplicates. Also, we have to avoid A and C and N.
        ""REBUS"" -> R E B U S -> but E is at position 2? and we don't know about B, U, S.

   - R at position 3:
        _ _ R E _ -> e.g., ""BORED"" -> but O is new? and D is new. Also, E is at position 4? which is allowed.

   - R at position 4:
        _ _ _ R E -> but E is at position 5? which is not allowed. So we cannot put E at 5. So if we put R at 4, then E must be at 1,2,3? but then we have two positions to fill? 

        Example: _ _ _ R _ and then put E at 1: ""E _ _ R _"", e.g., ""EVERY"" -> but duplicate E? and we don't know.

   - R at position 5: 
        _ _ _ _ R, and E at one of 1,2,3,4. Example: ""LATER"" -> but L, T, E, R -> but E is at position 4? and R at 5. But we have to avoid A? ""LATER"" has A which is absent! So we cannot use A.

        Without A: ""TIGER"" -> T I G E R -> E at position 4? and R at 5. But we don't know about T, I, G.

 Considering the above, let's try to choose a word that:

   - Contains R and E (since we know they are in the word).
   - Avoids C, A, N (absent letters).
   - Puts R in a new position (not position 2) and E in a new position (not position 5).
   - Uses common letters to maximize information.

 One candidate: ""ROGUE"" -> R at 1, O, G, U, E at 5? -> but E at 5 is not allowed. So skip.

 Another: ""RIPER"" -> duplicate R? and we don't know. Also, E at position 5? not allowed.

 How about ""ROBES""? -> R at 1, O, B, E at 4, S at 5. 
   E is at position 4 (allowed) and R at 1 (allowed). 
   Letters: R, O, B, E, S. We avoid C, A, N.

 But note: we don't know if O, B, S are in the word? This is a good test.

 Alternatively, ""RESTY"": R at 1, E at 2, S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5. 
   E is at position 2 (allowed) and R at 1 (allowed). 
   We test S, T, Y.

 Another common word: ""TRIED"" -> T, R, I, E, D. 
   R is at position 2? But wait, we know R is in the word but not at position 2. So we cannot put R at position 2 again? 
   Actually, we can put R at position 2? But the feedback told us that in the first guess R was at position 2 and that was wrong. So in the secret word, R is not at position 2. Therefore, in our new guess, if we put R at position 2, then we know it will be marked as '-' again? Because the secret word does not have R at position 2. But we already know that. So it's a waste of a position? 

   We want to test R in a new position to see if we can get a '✓'. So it's better to put R in a position we haven't tried and that is allowed (1,3,4,5). Similarly for E.

 In ""TRIED"", R is at position 2? That would be the same as the first guess? And we know it's not at 2. So we avoid that.

 How about ""DRIVE""? -> D, R, I, V, E. 
   R is at position 2? Again, same problem.

 We need to avoid position 2 for R.

 Let me try: ""PRICE"" -> but C is absent? We cannot use C.

 Without C: ""PRIDE"" -> P, R, I, D, E. 
   R is at position 2? Again, position 2 for R is not allowed? We know R is not at position 2 in the secret word. So if we put R at position 2, we will get a '-' again. But we are trying to find the correct position. So we should avoid position 2 for R.

 How about ""PERIL""? -> P, E, R, I, L. 
   R is at position 3 (which is allowed) and E at position 2 (which is allowed for E? yes, because E was only forbidden at position 5). 
   Letters: P, E, R, I, L. We avoid C, A, N.

 This seems good.

 Another candidate: ""BERYL"" -> B, E, R, Y, L. 
   E at position 2, R at position 3. 
   But we don't know about B, Y, L.

 However, note: we have already used E at position 2? But that's okay because we are testing.

 But wait: in the first guess, we had E at position 5 and got a '-'. Now we are putting E at position 2. If the secret word has E at position 2, we'll get a '✓'. If not, we'll get a '-'. Similarly for R at position 3.

 I think ""PERIL"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and tests new positions.

 Alternatively, ""ROUSE"": R at 1, O, U, S, E at 5? -> E at 5 is not allowed.

 How about ""ROLES"": R at 1, O, L, E at 4, S at 5? 
   E is at position 4? That's allowed. 
   So: R(1), O(2), L(3), E(4), S(5). 

 This is also a candidate.

 But note: we have to avoid using the same letter in the same position if we know it's wrong? We don't have any other constraints.

 Let me compare:

   ""PERIL"": tests positions: 
        P at 1 (new)
        E at 2 (new for E, since E was at 5 before)
        R at 3 (new for R, since R was at 2 before)
        I at 4 (new)
        L at 5 (new)

   ""ROLES"": 
        R at 1 (new for R)
        O at 2 (new)
        L at 3 (new)
        E at 4 (new for E, since E was at 5 before)
        S at 5 (new)

 Both are valid. But we want to cover more common consonants. The letters in ""PERIL"": P, E, R, I, L. Common letters: E, R, L, I, P.
 The letters in ""ROLES"": R, O, L, E, S. Common letters: R, O, L, E, S.

 Since S and O are very common, maybe ""ROLES"" is better? But we also have L and E in both.

 However, we already know R and E are in the word, so we are confirming their positions. The other letters (O, L, S) are common and we haven't tested them.

 I think ""ROLES"" is a good choice.

 But wait: what if the secret word has E at position 4? Then we get a '✓' for E. Similarly, if R is at position 1, we get a '✓'. 

 Alternatively, we might get '-' for R and E if they are in the word but not at these positions.

 Let's go with ""ROLES"".

 However, note: we are not forced to use R and E? Actually, we must use them because we know they are in the word? But the rules don't require that we use known letters? But if we don't use them, we won't get information about their positions. So it's better to use them.

 So I decide: ""ROLES""

 But let me check: is ""ROLES"" a valid word? Yes.

 Therefore, second guess: ""ROLES""

<guess>roles</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and N are **absent** (marked ""x"").
- R is **present** but not in position 2 (marked ""-"").
- E is **present** but not in position 5 (marked ""-"").

For the second guess:
- Must include **R** and **E** (since they are in the secret word).
- Avoid C, A, and N.
- Place R in a new position (not 2): options are 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- Place E in a new position (not 5): options are 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- Test new common letters (like S, O, L) to gather more information.

Chose **""ROLES""** because:
- R is at position 1 (new position for R).
- E is at position 4 (new position for E).
- Tests new letters: O, L, S (common consonants).
- Avoids C, A, N.

<guess>roles</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: roles -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) L(-) E(✓) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
  Meaning:
    - C, A, N are absent.
    - R is present (but not in position 2).
    - E is present (but not in position 5).

Guess 2: roles -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) L(-) E(✓) S(x)
  Meaning:
    - R is present but not in position 1 (because we put R at position 1 and got ""-"" meaning wrong position).
    - O is absent (since ""x"").
    - L is present but not in position 3 (because we put L at position 3 and got ""-"").
    - E is in the word and in the correct position (position 4) because ""✓"".
    - S is absent (since ""x"").

So from both guesses, we now know:

Absent letters: C, A, N, O, S
Present letters: R, E, L
  - E is fixed at position 4 (since we have E(✓) at position 4 in ""roles"").

Also, from Guess 1: E is present but not at position 5 -> but now we know E is at position 4, so that's consistent.

Positions we know:
  - E must be at position 4: so the word is _ _ _ E _

Constraints on R:
  - From Guess 1: R is not at position 2.
  - From Guess 2: R is not at position 1.

So R must be at position 3 or 5? (since position 2 and 1 are ruled out). The positions are 1,2,3,4,5. But position 4 is E, so R cannot be at position 4. Therefore, R must be at position 3 or 5.

Similarly, L is present but not at position 3 (from Guess 2). So L must be at position 1, 2, or 5? But note: if R is at position 5, then L can be at 1 or 2? Or vice versa.

We also have the present letters: R, E, L. And we know E is at 4.

Now, the word has 5 letters, so there are two more letters we don't know? But we only know 3 present letters? Actually, the word must have two more letters that we haven't discovered because the absent letters are C,A,N,O,S.

But note: we don't know if there are duplicates? We haven't encountered any duplicate feedback so far. The feedback for each letter is independent, and we haven't seen a letter appear twice in feedback? Actually, we only have one instance of R and one of E and one of L. So probably no duplicates.

So the secret word has 5 distinct letters: three we know (R, E, L) and two more that are not among the absent letters (C,A,N,O,S). 

The English alphabet has 26 letters. The absent letters are C,A,N,O,S. So the remaining possible letters are: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,M,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

We also know R is at position 3 or 5, and L is at position 1,2, or 5? But note: if R is at position 5, then position 5 is taken by R, so L cannot be at 5. Similarly, if R is at position 3, then L can be at 1,2,5? But position 5 is available.

So let's break it down.

Case 1: R at position 3, then L must be at 1,2, or 5? But we know L is not at position 3 (from ""roles"" feedback), which is already taken by R? But in this case, position 3 is R so L isn't there, which is consistent. So L can be at 1,2, or 5? However, we must assign L to one of these.

Case 2: R at position 5, then L can be at position 1 or 2? Because position 5 is taken by R, and position 3 is not L (from feedback) and position 4 is E.

Now, we need to form a 5-letter word that fits:

The pattern: _ _ _ E _  and we know:
  - E at 4.
  - R either at 3 or 5.
  - L at one of the remaining positions: if R at 3 then L at 1,2,5? But if R is at 3, then position 3 is R, so L must be at 1,2, or 5. But if we put L at 5, then position 5 is L? Then R would be at 3? That's fine.

Alternatively, if R is at 5, then position 5 is R, and L must be at 1 or 2.

So possible scenarios:

Scenario A: R at position 3, L at position 1: pattern: L _ R E _
Scenario B: R at position 3, L at position 2: pattern: _ L R E _
Scenario C: R at position 3, L at position 5: pattern: _ _ R E L
Scenario D: R at position 5, L at position 1: pattern: L _ _ E R
Scenario E: R at position 5, L at position 2: pattern: _ L _ E R

Now, we need to fill in the other positions with letters that are not absent (so not C, A, N, O, S) and not R,E,L (since we assume no duplicates?).

We should choose a word that tests as many of these possibilities as possible? But we have to pick one word.

Alternatively, we can try to find a word that fits one of these patterns and uses common letters.

Let's try to form words for each pattern:

Pattern A: L _ R E _
  We need a letter for position 2 and position 5.
  Example: LIBRE? but I and B? But we don't know if I or B is in the word? But LIBRE is a word? Yes, meaning free.

Pattern B: _ L R E _
  Example: BLARE? But B,L,A,R,E -> but A is absent? so invalid. 
  Another: FLARE? F,L,A,R,E -> A absent? Also invalid.
  Without A: GLARE? G,L,A,R,E -> A absent? Same.
  FLIER? FLIER is F,L,I,E,R -> positions: F at 1, L at 2, I at 3? But we need R at 3? But here I is at 3 and R at 5? That doesn't match because pattern must have R at 3: so pattern B: first letter unknown, then L at 2, R at 3, E at 4, then last letter.
  So: positions: 1: ?, 2: L, 3: R, 4: E, 5: ?
  Example words: 
      ULREE? not a word.
      PLIER? P,L,I,E,R -> but that would be P at 1, L at 2, I at 3? But we require R at 3? So if we have L at 2 and R at 3, then word must be ?LRE?
      PLRE? not 5 letters.
      ALERT? but A is absent.
      Let me think: ""ELVER"" -> E L V E R? But L at 2? And R at 5? And we have two E's? Not matching pattern B? 
      Another: ""BLUER"" -> B L U E R -> but that has U at 3? Not R at 3? 
      Actually, ""R"" is required at position 3? So ?LRE? 
      Words: 
        ""FLIER"" doesn't work because it has I at 3, not R.
        ""PLIER"" has I at 3? Not R.
        ""ALERT"" has A (absent) and E at position 2? Not L at 2? 
      I can't find a common word for pattern B? 

Pattern C: _ _ R E L
  Example: ""MOREL"" -> but M,O,R,E,L -> O is absent? So invalid.
          ""BAREL"" -> B,A,R,E,L -> A absent? invalid.
          ""QUREL"" -> not a word.
          ""TAREL"" -> T,A,R,E,L -> A absent? invalid.
          ""FIREL"" -> F,I,R,E,L -> which is F at 1, I at 2, R at 3, E at 4, L at 5. That matches? And letters: F,I,R,E,L. Absent letters? F and I are not absent? So ""FIREL"" is not a word? 
          ""Beryl"" is B,E,R,Y,L -> but that has E at position 2? Not position 4? And we have E fixed at position 4.

      For pattern C: positions 1 and 2 unknown, then R at 3, E at 4, L at 5. So ? ? R E L.
      Words: 
          ""CAREL"" -> C is absent? invalid.
          ""MIRREL"" -> not 5 letters.
          ""SOREL"" -> S,O,R,E,L -> O and S are absent? invalid.
          ""HAREL"" -> H,A,R,E,L -> A absent? invalid.
      I don't find an obvious word for pattern C? Maybe not common.

Pattern D: L _ _ E R
  Example: ""LIGER"" -> L,I,G,E,R -> which is L at 1, I at 2, G at 3, E at 4, R at 5. That fits.
  Another: ""LOWER"" -> L,O,W,E,R -> but O is absent? invalid.
  ""LUBER"" -> not a word? 
  ""LIBER"" -> L,I,B,E,R -> that's a word? It exists? meaning free? Yes, LIBER.

Pattern E: _ L _ E R
  Example: ""BLUER"" -> B,L,U,E,R -> but U at position 3? And R at 5? So pattern: B, L, U, E, R -> position 1: B, 2: L, 3: U, 4: E, 5: R. That's pattern E? Yes.
  Another: ""PLIER""? P,L,I,E,R -> but I at 3? same.

But note: pattern D and E are similar? Pattern D has L at 1, pattern E has L at 2.

So we have:
  Pattern A: L _ R E _ -> e.g., LIBRE? But LIBRE has L at 1, I at 2, R at 3, E at 4? And the last position? LIBRE is 5 letters? L-I-B-R-E? That’s positions: L at 1, I at 2, B at 3, R at 4? Actually, that doesn't fit because we require R at 3? 

  Correction: For pattern A: L at 1, then letter at 2, then R at 3, E at 4, then letter at 5.
      LIBRE: L (1), I (2), B (3), R (4)? -> doesn't work because R is at position 4? But we need R at 3? 
      Actually, if we define the pattern: positions: 1: L, 2: ?, 3: R, 4: E, 5: ?.
      Example: ""LIBER""? L,I,B,E,R -> that has R at position 5? Not at 3? 
      To have R at 3: ""LURE?"" -> L,U,R,E? That's only 4 letters? 
      ""LURED"" -> L, U, R, E, D -> positions: L at 1, U at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5. That fits? And D is not absent? 

  So ""LURED"" is a word? Yes.

  Pattern A: L, U, R, E, D -> word ""LURED"".

Pattern D: L,I,G,E,R -> ""LIGER"" is a word? Yes, meaning a cross between lion and tiger? But also ""TIGER"" might be? But TIGER has T at ? T,I,G,E,R -> which is pattern E? 

But we cannot use A, O, S, N, C.

So possible words we identified:
  Pattern A: ""LURED"" -> L,U,R,E,D
  Pattern D: ""LIBER"" -> L,I,B,E,R   [but note: R at position 5?] -> pattern: L at 1, I at 2, B at 3, E at 4, R at 5. But we have E at 4? Correct. And R at 5? And L at 1? This is pattern D: L _ _ E R -> so _ in position 2 and 3: so I and B? Then for pattern D: we have L, ?, ?, E, R -> positions: 1:L, 2:?, 3:?, 4:E, 5:R.

Actually, pattern D: L _ _ E R -> two letters in the middle.

Similarly, pattern E: _ L _ E R -> one letter at start and one in the middle.

So ""LIBER"" is pattern D: L at 1, I at 2, B at 3, E at 4, R at 5? Then yes? That's L (1), I (2), B (3), E (4), R (5). So matches pattern D.

But note: pattern D requires L at 1 and R at 5? Exactly.

Similarly, pattern A: ""LURED"" -> L at 1, U at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5? So in pattern A we have R at 3? So that is scenario A: R at 3, L at 1? Yes.

But we also have pattern E: ""BLUER"" -> B,L,U,E,R -> but U is at 3? And L at 2? So it matches pattern E? But we have R at 5? And E at 4? So _ L _ E R: B at 1, L at 2, U at 3, E at 4, R at 5? So exactly.

But now we have: 
  Scenario A: LURED (if it is valid)
  Scenario D: LIBER, LURER (but duplicate R? we don't know? and LURER may not be a word? Probably not) -> LIGER?
  Scenario E: BLUER, FLIER, PLIER? But FLIER and PLIER have I at 3? And they end with R? PLIER has P, L, I, E, R? Yes? That's pattern E: P at 1, L at 2, I at 3, E at 4, R at 5.

Now, with the feedback we don't have duplicates? So we can assume no duplicates? 

We need to choose a third guess that helps us differentiate the scenarios.

But note: we know E is at 4? And R is at 3 or 5? And L is at 1, 2, or 5? But depending on R.

We can try to choose a word that covers some of these possibilities and tests common letters.

However, we know from the present letters: R, E, L and E fixed at 4. And we need to find two more letters? 

We can try to pick a word that includes L and R? And E? And tests positions? But we have to choose one.

But note: we also have constraints:

  - R cannot be at position 1 or 2 (from past feedback). 
  - L cannot be at position 3 (from Guess 2).

And we know E is at 4.

So let's try to find a word that fits the pattern that might be the solution? Or one that gives us more information.

But we don't have enough constraints to pin down the word? We have five possible patterns? 

Alternatively, we might guess a word that tests one of the possibilities? For example, if we guess ""LURED"", that would tell us if the pattern A is correct.

But maybe we should choose a word that doesn't depend on the unknown letters? But we have to.

The known present letters are R, E, L? And two more are unknown? So if we guess a word that includes R, E, L and two new letters that we don't know? We can test them.

But we should avoid absent letters: C, A, N, O, S.

So let me propose a word that tests the position of R, L and includes E at 4? And two new letters.

Since E must be at 4, we can try to fix that.

The word must be * * E * ? With E at position 4.

And it must contain R and L? And avoid absent letters.

So structure: position 4: E, and positions 1,2,3,5: to be filled? With two of them being R and L? And the other two new letters? But we don't have to assign both R and L? Actually, we must because they are in the word.

We also know:
  R cannot be at 1 or 2? -> so R must be at 3 or 5? because position 1 and 2 are forbidden for R? And position 4 is E.

  Similarly, L cannot be at 3? -> so L must be at 1, 2, or 5? but if R is at 5, then L can be at 1 or 2? and if R is at 3, then L at 1,2,5? 

So we can consider:

Option 1: Put R at position 3? 
  Then word: _ _ R E _ ? And L must be at 1, 2, or 5? But we also need two more letters? 
  Let’s pick common letters? For positions 1 and 2: we can pick common consonants or vowels? For position 5: one letter.

  We need to choose a word that has L at either 1, 2, or 5 and R at 3.

  Example: word with L at 1: pattern L _ R E ? 
      L? R E ? -> letters: L at 1, R at 3, E at 4, and positions 2 and 5: two new letters.
      Example: ""LURED"" (as before): L,U,R,E,D -> but U and D? 
      Or ""LIBER"" wouldn't work because R is at 4? Or ""LIBER"" has R at 5, not at 3? 

  Actually, ""LIBER"" has R at 5? Can we find a word like L? R E ?? 
      ""LAREE"" -> A absent? invalid.
      ""LIRE?"" not 5 letters.
      ""LURED"" is one.

Option 2: Put R at position 5?
  Then word: _ _ _ E R? And L must be at 1 or 2? Because it cannot be at 3? And 4 is E, and 5 is R? So L must be at 1 or 2.

  Example: 
      If L at 1: L ? ? E R -> e.g., ""LIBER"": L,I,B,E,R -> which is pattern D.
      If L at 2: ? L ? E R -> e.g., ""BLUER"" (if not absent letters) but U is acceptable? Or ""PLIER"": P,L,I,E,R? Or ""ALERT"" with A absent? Not.

But in our case, ""BLUER"" has letter B,L,U,E,R? B and U are not absent? So okay? And ""PLIER"" has P,L,I,E,R.

To maximize new letters, I am considering trying ""LURED"". 

But first, suppose we guess ""LURED"":
  That covers:
    L at 1? So if L is at 1? And R at 3? And E at 4? 
  The word is L,U,R,E,D.

This would be matching scenario A: R at position 3, L at position 1? 

If it is the secret word, we win? But we are on the third guess.

If not, we get feedback? 

Alternatively, if we want to test both R positions, we can try a word that has R at 5? and L at 1? But E at 4? For example, ""LIBER"" (but we have to make sure the other letters are not absent?).

But note: we have two possible groupings:

We can split the possibilities by choosing a word that forces differentiation.

Or, we can try to find a word that fits one of the scenarios and uses common letters? 

Maybe ""TRIBE"" but T,R,I,B,E -> and T,R,I,B,E at: T at 1, R at 2? But R cannot be at 2? so we must avoid.

Another idea: we know E is at 4? Let's choose a word that puts L and R in permitted positions and tests new common letters? For example, include T.

What is common? Let's try: Pattern: _ _ _ E R? And put L at 2? Then it becomes: ? L ? E R.

And choose common letters: B and I? That would be ""BLIER""? B,L,I,E,R? Is that a word? Blier means more blue? Not common? ""PLIER"" is more common.

Or ""S?"" but S is absent.

How about ""GLUER""? G and U? But that's pattern? G,L,U,E,R -> which is _ L _ E R? So L at 2, U at 3? And R at 5? E at 4? So if we guess ""GLUER""? Or ""G"" may be okay? Then the word is G,L,U,E,R.

But let me check: absent letters are C,A,O,N,S? So G, U are okay.

But I don't know if ""GLUER"" is common? Also, what about ""TILER""? T,I,L,E,R -> T at 1, I at 2, L at 3? But L at 3? We know L cannot be at position 3? Because in ""roles"", L was at position 3 and we got '-', meaning L is in the word but not at position 3? So we cannot put L at 3.

So we must avoid L at 3? In ""TILER"", L is at 3? Which is not allowed? Because feedback said L in ""roles"" at position 3 got '-', so it cannot be at 3 in the secret word.

Similarly, we must avoid L at 3? So any guess we make, if we put L at 3? It would be marked as '-', which we already know? So we should avoid wasting a position? Unless we want to confirm.

But we already know it? So it's redundant.

So back to our options:

I will choose to guess ""LURED"" to test pattern A? because it has L at 1, R at 3, E at 4? And tests U and D? Both new letters? 

If it's not the word, we get feedback: 

  If ""LURED"" is the secret we win.

  Otherwise:
  We might get:
      L: ✓ or -? If L is at position 1? Then we get ✓? 
      U: if U is in the word? We get - or x? 
      R: we put at 3? So if R is at position 3? Then ✓? We know R is either at 3 or 5? 
      E: ✓ because position 4.
      D: ...

But if the feedback shows:
  If L is not at position 1? But then we get '-', meaning L is in the word but not at 1? 

Similarly, if R is not at position 3? We get '-'? But we know R must be at 3 or 5? If not at 3, then it must be at 5.

And U and D would tell us.

But we have only 6 guesses? So we can be strategic.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that has E at 4? And doesn't commit to a particular scenario? But still tests L at 1 or 2? 

For example, put L at 1? and not fix R at 3? Because R could be at 5? Then if L is at 1? We get ✓ for L? 

But the word should have R at either 3 or 5? Let's try to guess a word that has L at 1? E at 4? And R at 5? For example, ""LIBER""?

If we guess ""LIBER"":

  Pattern: L at 1, R at 5? E at 4? Then if the secret word fits pattern D? However, if the secret word is ""LURED"", then ""LIBER"" would be: 
      L: ✓ (because both at 1)
      I: we don't know? 
      B: absent? 
      E: ✓ at 4.
      R: at 5? But in ""LURED"", R is at 3? So R at 5 in ""LIBER"" may be marked as 'x' if the secret word is ""LURED""? But no: R is in the word? And in ""LURED"", R is at 3, so in ""LIBER"", R at 5 would be present but not at 5, so '-', meaning the secret word has R but not at 5? That would tell us that R is not at 5? So then it must be at 3.

Then we know R is at 3? And L at 1? So pattern A? Then next guess ""LURED"".

But that uses two guesses.

But if we guess ""LURED"" now, and if it's correct, we win in three? If not, we still have information.

I think let's go with ""LURED"" for the third guess.

So the guessed word: ""lured""

But in uppercase? The rules say ""5-letter English word"" and previous guesses are in lowercase? So lowercase.

<guess>lured</guess>

Let me confirm: ""LURED"" has L at 1, U at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5? And positions: 
  L at 1 -> we don't know if L is at 1? 
  U at 2 -> new
  R at 3 -> we are testing if R is at 3?
  E at 4 -> known correct
  D at 5 -> new

This guess will give us feedback on L's position (if it is at 1? or not) and R's position (if at 3? or not) and also tell us about U and D.

If we get:
  L(?), U(?), R(?), E(✓), D(?)

And compare to the known present letters? 

So it's a good test.After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

- **C, A, N, O, S** are **absent** (marked ""x"").
- **E** is **correctly placed at position 4** (marked ""✓"" in ""roles"").
- **R** is **present** but not at position 1 or 2.
- **L** is **present** but not at position 3.

Deductions:
- E must be at position 4 (secret word pattern: \_ \_ \_ E \_).
- R must be at position 3 or 5 (since positions 1 and 2 are ruled out).
- L must be at position 1, 2, or 5 (since position 3 is ruled out).
- The secret word contains exactly 5 distinct letters (no duplicates indicated in feedback).
- Absent letters (C, A, N, O, S) must be excluded.

For the third guess, **""LURED""** is chosen because:
- Fits letter/position constraints: E at position 4.
- Tests R at position 3 and L at position 1.
- Uses new common letters (U, D) to gather additional information.
- Optimizes potential to confirm R and L positions while adhering to rules.

But the rules don\'t specify, so we assume no duplicates unless feedback suggests otherwise. But in this feedback, we don\'t have any duplicates.\n\n Now, for the second guess, we want to try to place R and E in new positions and also test new letters.\n\n We know the word has R and E. Let\'s try to think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N.\n\n Also, we want to cover more common letters. Common consonants besides R: T, L, S, etc. Common vowels: we have E, and we know A is absent, so other vowels: O, I, U? But we have E already.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word:\n\n We know:\n   Position 1: cannot be C (absent) and we don\'t know about others. But we can try to put R at position 1? Or E? Or a new letter.\n\n Since R is in the word and not at position 2, let\'s try putting R at position 1. And E is not at position 5, so let\'s put E at position 4? Or 3? We have to choose.\n\n Also, we need to avoid positions that we know are wrong for R and E? Actually, we only know that R is not at 2 and E is not at 5. So:\n\n   For R: allowed positions: 1, 3, 4, 5.\n   For E: allowed positions: 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\n We can try to put R at position 1 and E at position 3? Or position 4? \n\n Let\'s think of words that start with R and have E in the middle.\n\n Example: ""REBEL"" -> but that has E at position 2 and 4? And we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have to avoid A and C and N.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters. The rules don\'t forbid it, but we haven\'t seen any feedback suggesting duplicates. So we should avoid assuming duplicates until necessary.\n\n Alternatively, let\'s try a word that has R at position 1 and E at position 4? \n\n Example: ""ROUTE"" -> but we don\'t know if O and U and T are in the word? Also, we have E at position 5? But wait, in ""ROUTE"", E is at position 5, which we know is not allowed for E (because in the first guess E was at position 5 and got a \'-\', meaning E is in the word but not at position 5). So we cannot put E at position 5.\n\n So we need E at positions 1,2,3, or 4.\n\n Let me try: ""RESTY"" -> R at 1, E at 2, S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5. But we don\'t know if S, T, Y are in the word? And we are testing new letters.\n\n However, note that in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and now we are putting R at position 1. That\'s allowed because the feedback only said R is not at position 2.\n\n Similarly, E was at position 5 and now we put it at position 2.\n\n But wait: what if the word has two R\'s? We don\'t know. But we can try.\n\n Alternatively, we can avoid putting R at position 1 and try a different position? But we have to test.\n\n Another idea: we know the word has R and E. We can try to put R at position 3 and E at position 1? For example: ""PERKY"" -> P, E, R, K, Y.\n\n But we don\'t know if P, K, Y are in the word? And we are avoiding C, A, N.\n\n However, we have to test new letters.\n\n Let me list some words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N:\n\n   - R at position 1: \n        R E _ _ _ -> e.g., ""RESET"" (but duplicate E? and we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed) -> but we don\'t want to assume duplicates. Also, we have to avoid A and C and N.\n        ""REBUS"" -> R E B U S -> but E is at position 2? and we don\'t know about B, U, S.\n\n   - R at position 3:\n        _ _ R E _ -> e.g., ""BORED"" -> but O is new? and D is new. Also, E is at position 4? which is allowed.\n\n   - R at position 4:\n        _ _ _ R E -> but E is at position 5? which is not allowed. So we cannot put E at 5. So if we put R at 4, then E must be at 1,2,3? but then we have two positions to fill? \n\n        Example: _ _ _ R _ and then put E at 1: ""E _ _ R _"", e.g., ""EVERY"" -> but duplicate E? and we don\'t know.\n\n   - R at position 5: \n        _ _ _ _ R, and E at one of 1,2,3,4. Example: ""LATER"" -> but L, T, E, R -> but E is at position 4? and R at 5. But we have to avoid A? ""LATER"" has A which is absent! So we cannot use A.\n\n        Without A: ""TIGER"" -> T I G E R -> E at position 4? and R at 5. But we don\'t know about T, I, G.\n\n Considering the above, let\'s try to choose a word that:\n\n   - Contains R and E (since we know they are in the word).\n   - Avoids C, A, N (absent letters).\n   - Puts R in a new position (not position 2) and E in a new position (not position 5).\n   - Uses common letters to maximize information.\n\n One candidate: ""ROGUE"" -> R at 1, O, G, U, E at 5? -> but E at 5 is not allowed. So skip.\n\n Another: ""RIPER"" -> duplicate R? and we don\'t know. Also, E at position 5? not allowed.\n\n How about ""ROBES""? -> R at 1, O, B, E at 4, S at 5. \n   E is at position 4 (allowed) and R at 1 (allowed). \n   Letters: R, O, B, E, S. We avoid C, A, N.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if O, B, S are in the word? This is a good test.\n\n Alternatively, ""RESTY"": R at 1, E at 2, S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5. \n   E is at position 2 (allowed) and R at 1 (allowed). \n   We test S, T, Y.\n\n Another common word: ""TRIED"" -> T, R, I, E, D. \n   R is at position 2? But wait, we know R is in the word but not at position 2. So we cannot put R at position 2 again? \n   Actually, we can put R at position 2? But the feedback told us that in the first guess R was at position 2 and that was wrong. So in the secret word, R is not at position 2. Therefore, in our new guess, if we put R at position 2, then we know it will be marked as \'-\' again? Because the secret word does not have R at position 2. But we already know that. So it\'s a waste of a position? \n\n   We want to test R in a new position to see if we can get a \'✓\'. So it\'s better to put R in a position we haven\'t tried and that is allowed (1,3,4,5). Similarly for E.\n\n In ""TRIED"", R is at position 2? That would be the same as the first guess? And we know it\'s not at 2. So we avoid that.\n\n How about ""DRIVE""? -> D, R, I, V, E. \n   R is at position 2? Again, same problem.\n\n We need to avoid position 2 for R.\n\n Let me try: ""PRICE"" -> but C is absent? We cannot use C.\n\n Without C: ""PRIDE"" -> P, R, I, D, E. \n   R is at position 2? Again, position 2 for R is not allowed? We know R is not at position 2 in the secret word. So if we put R at position 2, we will get a \'-\' again. But we are trying to find the correct position. So we should avoid position 2 for R.\n\n How about ""PERIL""? -> P, E, R, I, L. \n   R is at position 3 (which is allowed) and E at position 2 (which is allowed for E? yes, because E was only forbidden at position 5). \n   Letters: P, E, R, I, L. We avoid C, A, N.\n\n This seems good.\n\n Another candidate: ""BERYL"" -> B, E, R, Y, L. \n   E at position 2, R at position 3. \n   But we don\'t know about B, Y, L.\n\n However, note: we have already used E at position 2? But that\'s okay because we are testing.\n\n But wait: in the first guess, we had E at position 5 and got a \'-\'. Now we are putting E at position 2. If the secret word has E at position 2, we\'ll get a \'✓\'. If not, we\'ll get a \'-\'. Similarly for R at position 3.\n\n I think ""PERIL"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and tests new positions.\n\n Alternatively, ""ROUSE"": R at 1, O, U, S, E at 5? -> E at 5 is not allowed.\n\n How about ""ROLES"": R at 1, O, L, E at 4, S at 5? \n   E is at position 4? That\'s allowed. \n   So: R(1), O(2), L(3), E(4), S(5). \n\n This is also a candidate.\n\n But note: we have to avoid using the same letter in the same position if we know it\'s wrong? We don\'t have any other constraints.\n\n Let me compare:\n\n   ""PERIL"": tests positions: \n        P at 1 (new)\n        E at 2 (new for E, since E was at 5 before)\n        R at 3 (new for R, since R was at 2 before)\n        I at 4 (new)\n        L at 5 (new)\n\n   ""ROLES"": \n        R at 1 (new for R)\n        O at 2 (new)\n        L at 3 (new)\n        E at 4 (new for E, since E was at 5 before)\n        S at 5 (new)\n\n Both are valid. But we want to cover more common consonants. The letters in ""PERIL"": P, E, R, I, L. Common letters: E, R, L, I, P.\n The letters in ""ROLES"": R, O, L, E, S. Common letters: R, O, L, E, S.\n\n Since S and O are very common, maybe ""ROLES"" is better? But we also have L and E in both.\n\n However, we already know R and E are in the word, so we are confirming their positions. The other letters (O, L, S) are common and we haven\'t tested them.\n\n I think ""ROLES"" is a good choice.\n\n But wait: what if the secret word has E at position 4? Then we get a \'✓\' for E. Similarly, if R is at position 1, we get a \'✓\'. \n\n Alternatively, we might get \'-\' for R and E if they are in the word but not at these positions.\n\n Let\'s go with ""ROLES"".\n\n However, note: we are not forced to use R and E? Actually, we must use them because we know they are in the word? But the rules don\'t require that we use known letters? But if we don\'t use them, we won\'t get information about their positions. So it\'s better to use them.\n\n So I decide: ""ROLES""\n\n But let me check: is ""ROLES"" a valid word? Yes.\n\n Therefore, second guess: ""ROLES""\n\n<guess>roles</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, A, and N are **absent** (marked ""x"").\n- R is **present** but not in position 2 (marked ""-"").\n- E is **present** but not in position 5 (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Must include **R** and **E** (since they are in the secret word).\n- Avoid C, A, and N.\n- Place R in a new position (not 2): options are 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n- Place E in a new position (not 5): options are 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n- Test new common letters (like S, O, L) to gather more information.\n\nChose **""ROLES""** because:\n- R is at position 1 (new position for R).\n- E is at position 4 (new position for E).\n- Tests new letters: O, L, S (common consonants).\n- Avoids C, A, N.\n\n<guess>roles</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: roles -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) L(-) E(✓) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\n  Meaning:\n    - C, A, N are absent.\n    - R is present (but not in position 2).\n    - E is present (but not in position 5).\n\nGuess 2: roles -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) L(-) E(✓) S(x)\n  Meaning:\n    - R is present but not in position 1 (because we put R at position 1 and got ""-"" meaning wrong position).\n    - O is absent (since ""x"").\n    - L is present but not in position 3 (because we put L at position 3 and got ""-"").\n    - E is in the word and in the correct position (position 4) because ""✓"".\n    - S is absent (since ""x"").\n\nSo from both guesses, we now know:\n\nAbsent letters: C, A, N, O, S\nPresent letters: R, E, L\n  - E is fixed at position 4 (since we have E(✓) at position 4 in ""roles"").\n\nAlso, from Guess 1: E is present but not at position 5 -> but now we know E is at position 4, so that\'s consistent.\n\nPositions we know:\n  - E must be at position 4: so the word is _ _ _ E _\n\nConstraints on R:\n  - From Guess 1: R is not at position 2.\n  - From Guess 2: R is not at position 1.\n\nSo R must be at position 3 or 5? (since position 2 and 1 are ruled out). The positions are 1,2,3,4,5. But position 4 is E, so R cannot be at position 4. Therefore, R must be at position 3 or 5.\n\nSimilarly, L is present but not at position 3 (from Guess 2). So L must be at position 1, 2, or 5? But note: if R is at position 5, then L can be at 1 or 2? Or vice versa.\n\nWe also have the present letters: R, E, L. And we know E is at 4.\n\nNow, the word has 5 letters, so there are two more letters we don\'t know? But we only know 3 present letters? Actually, the word must have two more letters that we haven\'t discovered because the absent letters are C,A,N,O,S.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if there are duplicates? We haven\'t encountered any duplicate feedback so far. The feedback for each letter is independent, and we haven\'t seen a letter appear twice in feedback? Actually, we only have one instance of R and one of E and one of L. So probably no duplicates.\n\nSo the secret word has 5 distinct letters: three we know (R, E, L) and two more that are not among the absent letters (C,A,N,O,S). \n\nThe English alphabet has 26 letters. The absent letters are C,A,N,O,S. So the remaining possible letters are: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,M,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nWe also know R is at position 3 or 5, and L is at position 1,2, or 5? But note: if R is at position 5, then position 5 is taken by R, so L cannot be at 5. Similarly, if R is at position 3, then L can be at 1,2,5? But position 5 is available.\n\nSo let\'s break it down.\n\nCase 1: R at position 3, then L must be at 1,2, or 5? But we know L is not at position 3 (from ""roles"" feedback), which is already taken by R? But in this case, position 3 is R so L isn\'t there, which is consistent. So L can be at 1,2, or 5? However, we must assign L to one of these.\n\nCase 2: R at position 5, then L can be at position 1 or 2? Because position 5 is taken by R, and position 3 is not L (from feedback) and position 4 is E.\n\nNow, we need to form a 5-letter word that fits:\n\nThe pattern: _ _ _ E _  and we know:\n  - E at 4.\n  - R either at 3 or 5.\n  - L at one of the remaining positions: if R at 3 then L at 1,2,5? But if R is at 3, then position 3 is R, so L must be at 1,2, or 5. But if we put L at 5, then position 5 is L? Then R would be at 3? That\'s fine.\n\nAlternatively, if R is at 5, then position 5 is R, and L must be at 1 or 2.\n\nSo possible scenarios:\n\nScenario A: R at position 3, L at position 1: pattern: L _ R E _\nScenario B: R at position 3, L at position 2: pattern: _ L R E _\nScenario C: R at position 3, L at position 5: pattern: _ _ R E L\nScenario D: R at position 5, L at position 1: pattern: L _ _ E R\nScenario E: R at position 5, L at position 2: pattern: _ L _ E R\n\nNow, we need to fill in the other positions with letters that are not absent (so not C, A, N, O, S) and not R,E,L (since we assume no duplicates?).\n\nWe should choose a word that tests as many of these possibilities as possible? But we have to pick one word.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to find a word that fits one of these patterns and uses common letters.\n\nLet\'s try to form words for each pattern:\n\nPattern A: L _ R E _\n  We need a letter for position 2 and position 5.\n  Example: LIBRE? but I and B? But we don\'t know if I or B is in the word? But LIBRE is a word? Yes, meaning free.\n\nPattern B: _ L R E _\n  Example: BLARE? But B,L,A,R,E -> but A is absent? so invalid. \n  Another: FLARE? F,L,A,R,E -> A absent? Also invalid.\n  Without A: GLARE? G,L,A,R,E -> A absent? Same.\n  FLIER? FLIER is F,L,I,E,R -> positions: F at 1, L at 2, I at 3? But we need R at 3? But here I is at 3 and R at 5? That doesn\'t match because pattern must have R at 3: so pattern B: first letter unknown, then L at 2, R at 3, E at 4, then last letter.\n  So: positions: 1: ?, 2: L, 3: R, 4: E, 5: ?\n  Example words: \n      ULREE? not a word.\n      PLIER? P,L,I,E,R -> but that would be P at 1, L at 2, I at 3? But we require R at 3? So if we have L at 2 and R at 3, then word must be ?LRE?\n      PLRE? not 5 letters.\n      ALERT? but A is absent.\n      Let me think: ""ELVER"" -> E L V E R? But L at 2? And R at 5? And we have two E\'s? Not matching pattern B? \n      Another: ""BLUER"" -> B L U E R -> but that has U at 3? Not R at 3? \n      Actually, ""R"" is required at position 3? So ?LRE? \n      Words: \n        ""FLIER"" doesn\'t work because it has I at 3, not R.\n        ""PLIER"" has I at 3? Not R.\n        ""ALERT"" has A (absent) and E at position 2? Not L at 2? \n      I can\'t find a common word for pattern B? \n\nPattern C: _ _ R E L\n  Example: ""MOREL"" -> but M,O,R,E,L -> O is absent? So invalid.\n          ""BAREL"" -> B,A,R,E,L -> A absent? invalid.\n          ""QUREL"" -> not a word.\n          ""TAREL"" -> T,A,R,E,L -> A absent? invalid.\n          ""FIREL"" -> F,I,R,E,L -> which is F at 1, I at 2, R at 3, E at 4, L at 5. That matches? And letters: F,I,R,E,L. Absent letters? F and I are not absent? So ""FIREL"" is not a word? \n          ""Beryl"" is B,E,R,Y,L -> but that has E at position 2? Not position 4? And we have E fixed at position 4.\n\n      For pattern C: positions 1 and 2 unknown, then R at 3, E at 4, L at 5. So ? ? R E L.\n      Words: \n          ""CAREL"" -> C is absent? invalid.\n          ""MIRREL"" -> not 5 letters.\n          ""SOREL"" -> S,O,R,E,L -> O and S are absent? invalid.\n          ""HAREL"" -> H,A,R,E,L -> A absent? invalid.\n      I don\'t find an obvious word for pattern C? Maybe not common.\n\nPattern D: L _ _ E R\n  Example: ""LIGER"" -> L,I,G,E,R -> which is L at 1, I at 2, G at 3, E at 4, R at 5. That fits.\n  Another: ""LOWER"" -> L,O,W,E,R -> but O is absent? invalid.\n  ""LUBER"" -> not a word? \n  ""LIBER"" -> L,I,B,E,R -> that\'s a word? It exists? meaning free? Yes, LIBER.\n\nPattern E: _ L _ E R\n  Example: ""BLUER"" -> B,L,U,E,R -> but U at position 3? And R at 5? So pattern: B, L, U, E, R -> position 1: B, 2: L, 3: U, 4: E, 5: R. That\'s pattern E? Yes.\n  Another: ""PLIER""? P,L,I,E,R -> but I at 3? same.\n\nBut note: pattern D and E are similar? Pattern D has L at 1, pattern E has L at 2.\n\nSo we have:\n  Pattern A: L _ R E _ -> e.g., LIBRE? But LIBRE has L at 1, I at 2, R at 3, E at 4? And the last position? LIBRE is 5 letters? L-I-B-R-E? That’s positions: L at 1, I at 2, B at 3, R at 4? Actually, that doesn\'t fit because we require R at 3? \n\n  Correction: For pattern A: L at 1, then letter at 2, then R at 3, E at 4, then letter at 5.\n      LIBRE: L (1), I (2), B (3), R (4)? -> doesn\'t work because R is at position 4? But we need R at 3? \n      Actually, if we define the pattern: positions: 1: L, 2: ?, 3: R, 4: E, 5: ?.\n      Example: ""LIBER""? L,I,B,E,R -> that has R at position 5? Not at 3? \n      To have R at 3: ""LURE?"" -> L,U,R,E? That\'s only 4 letters? \n      ""LURED"" -> L, U, R, E, D -> positions: L at 1, U at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5. That fits? And D is not absent? \n\n  So ""LURED"" is a word? Yes.\n\n  Pattern A: L, U, R, E, D -> word ""LURED"".\n\nPattern D: L,I,G,E,R -> ""LIGER"" is a word? Yes, meaning a cross between lion and tiger? But also ""TIGER"" might be? But TIGER has T at ? T,I,G,E,R -> which is pattern E? \n\nBut we cannot use A, O, S, N, C.\n\nSo possible words we identified:\n  Pattern A: ""LURED"" -> L,U,R,E,D\n  Pattern D: ""LIBER"" -> L,I,B,E,R   [but note: R at position 5?] -> pattern: L at 1, I at 2, B at 3, E at 4, R at 5. But we have E at 4? Correct. And R at 5? And L at 1? This is pattern D: L _ _ E R -> so _ in position 2 and 3: so I and B? Then for pattern D: we have L, ?, ?, E, R -> positions: 1:L, 2:?, 3:?, 4:E, 5:R.\n\nActually, pattern D: L _ _ E R -> two letters in the middle.\n\nSimilarly, pattern E: _ L _ E R -> one letter at start and one in the middle.\n\nSo ""LIBER"" is pattern D: L at 1, I at 2, B at 3, E at 4, R at 5? Then yes? That\'s L (1), I (2), B (3), E (4), R (5). So matches pattern D.\n\nBut note: pattern D requires L at 1 and R at 5? Exactly.\n\nSimilarly, pattern A: ""LURED"" -> L at 1, U at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5? So in pattern A we have R at 3? So that is scenario A: R at 3, L at 1? Yes.\n\nBut we also have pattern E: ""BLUER"" -> B,L,U,E,R -> but U is at 3? And L at 2? So it matches pattern E? But we have R at 5? And E at 4? So _ L _ E R: B at 1, L at 2, U at 3, E at 4, R at 5? So exactly.\n\nBut now we have: \n  Scenario A: LURED (if it is valid)\n  Scenario D: LIBER, LURER (but duplicate R? we don\'t know? and LURER may not be a word? Probably not) -> LIGER?\n  Scenario E: BLUER, FLIER, PLIER? But FLIER and PLIER have I at 3? And they end with R? PLIER has P, L, I, E, R? Yes? That\'s pattern E: P at 1, L at 2, I at 3, E at 4, R at 5.\n\nNow, with the feedback we don\'t have duplicates? So we can assume no duplicates? \n\nWe need to choose a third guess that helps us differentiate the scenarios.\n\nBut note: we know E is at 4? And R is at 3 or 5? And L is at 1, 2, or 5? But depending on R.\n\nWe can try to choose a word that covers some of these possibilities and tests common letters.\n\nHowever, we know from the present letters: R, E, L and E fixed at 4. And we need to find two more letters? \n\nWe can try to pick a word that includes L and R? And E? And tests positions? But we have to choose one.\n\nBut note: we also have constraints:\n\n  - R cannot be at position 1 or 2 (from past feedback). \n  - L cannot be at position 3 (from Guess 2).\n\nAnd we know E is at 4.\n\nSo let\'s try to find a word that fits the pattern that might be the solution? Or one that gives us more information.\n\nBut we don\'t have enough constraints to pin down the word? We have five possible patterns? \n\nAlternatively, we might guess a word that tests one of the possibilities? For example, if we guess ""LURED"", that would tell us if the pattern A is correct.\n\nBut maybe we should choose a word that doesn\'t depend on the unknown letters? But we have to.\n\nThe known present letters are R, E, L? And two more are unknown? So if we guess a word that includes R, E, L and two new letters that we don\'t know? We can test them.\n\nBut we should avoid absent letters: C, A, N, O, S.\n\nSo let me propose a word that tests the position of R, L and includes E at 4? And two new letters.\n\nSince E must be at 4, we can try to fix that.\n\nThe word must be * * E * ? With E at position 4.\n\nAnd it must contain R and L? And avoid absent letters.\n\nSo structure: position 4: E, and positions 1,2,3,5: to be filled? With two of them being R and L? And the other two new letters? But we don\'t have to assign both R and L? Actually, we must because they are in the word.\n\nWe also know:\n  R cannot be at 1 or 2? -> so R must be at 3 or 5? because position 1 and 2 are forbidden for R? And position 4 is E.\n\n  Similarly, L cannot be at 3? -> so L must be at 1, 2, or 5? but if R is at 5, then L can be at 1 or 2? and if R is at 3, then L at 1,2,5? \n\nSo we can consider:\n\nOption 1: Put R at position 3? \n  Then word: _ _ R E _ ? And L must be at 1, 2, or 5? But we also need two more letters? \n  Let’s pick common letters? For positions 1 and 2: we can pick common consonants or vowels? For position 5: one letter.\n\n  We need to choose a word that has L at either 1, 2, or 5 and R at 3.\n\n  Example: word with L at 1: pattern L _ R E ? \n      L? R E ? -> letters: L at 1, R at 3, E at 4, and positions 2 and 5: two new letters.\n      Example: ""LURED"" (as before): L,U,R,E,D -> but U and D? \n      Or ""LIBER"" wouldn\'t work because R is at 4? Or ""LIBER"" has R at 5, not at 3? \n\n  Actually, ""LIBER"" has R at 5? Can we find a word like L? R E ?? \n      ""LAREE"" -> A absent? invalid.\n      ""LIRE?"" not 5 letters.\n      ""LURED"" is one.\n\nOption 2: Put R at position 5?\n  Then word: _ _ _ E R? And L must be at 1 or 2? Because it cannot be at 3? And 4 is E, and 5 is R? So L must be at 1 or 2.\n\n  Example: \n      If L at 1: L ? ? E R -> e.g., ""LIBER"": L,I,B,E,R -> which is pattern D.\n      If L at 2: ? L ? E R -> e.g., ""BLUER"" (if not absent letters) but U is acceptable? Or ""PLIER"": P,L,I,E,R? Or ""ALERT"" with A absent? Not.\n\nBut in our case, ""BLUER"" has letter B,L,U,E,R? B and U are not absent? So okay? And ""PLIER"" has P,L,I,E,R.\n\nTo maximize new letters, I am considering trying ""LURED"". \n\nBut first, suppose we guess ""LURED"":\n  That covers:\n    L at 1? So if L is at 1? And R at 3? And E at 4? \n  The word is L,U,R,E,D.\n\nThis would be matching scenario A: R at position 3, L at position 1? \n\nIf it is the secret word, we win? But we are on the third guess.\n\nIf not, we get feedback? \n\nAlternatively, if we want to test both R positions, we can try a word that has R at 5? and L at 1? But E at 4? For example, ""LIBER"" (but we have to make sure the other letters are not absent?).\n\nBut note: we have two possible groupings:\n\nWe can split the possibilities by choosing a word that forces differentiation.\n\nOr, we can try to find a word that fits one of the scenarios and uses common letters? \n\nMaybe ""TRIBE"" but T,R,I,B,E -> and T,R,I,B,E at: T at 1, R at 2? But R cannot be at 2? so we must avoid.\n\nAnother idea: we know E is at 4? Let\'s choose a word that puts L and R in permitted positions and tests new common letters? For example, include T.\n\nWhat is common? Let\'s try: Pattern: _ _ _ E R? And put L at 2? Then it becomes: ? L ? E R.\n\nAnd choose common letters: B and I? That would be ""BLIER""? B,L,I,E,R? Is that a word? Blier means more blue? Not common? ""PLIER"" is more common.\n\nOr ""S?"" but S is absent.\n\nHow about ""GLUER""? G and U? But that\'s pattern? G,L,U,E,R -> which is _ L _ E R? So L at 2, U at 3? And R at 5? E at 4? So if we guess ""GLUER""? Or ""G"" may be okay? Then the word is G,L,U,E,R.\n\nBut let me check: absent letters are C,A,O,N,S? So G, U are okay.\n\nBut I don\'t know if ""GLUER"" is common? Also, what about ""TILER""? T,I,L,E,R -> T at 1, I at 2, L at 3? But L at 3? We know L cannot be at position 3? Because in ""roles"", L was at position 3 and we got \'-\', meaning L is in the word but not at position 3? So we cannot put L at 3.\n\nSo we must avoid L at 3? In ""TILER"", L is at 3? Which is not allowed? Because feedback said L in ""roles"" at position 3 got \'-\', so it cannot be at 3 in the secret word.\n\nSimilarly, we must avoid L at 3? So any guess we make, if we put L at 3? It would be marked as \'-\', which we already know? So we should avoid wasting a position? Unless we want to confirm.\n\nBut we already know it? So it\'s redundant.\n\nSo back to our options:\n\nI will choose to guess ""LURED"" to test pattern A? because it has L at 1, R at 3, E at 4? And tests U and D? Both new letters? \n\nIf it\'s not the word, we get feedback: \n\n  If ""LURED"" is the secret we win.\n\n  Otherwise:\n  We might get:\n      L: ✓ or -? If L is at position 1? Then we get ✓? \n      U: if U is in the word? We get - or x? \n      R: we put at 3? So if R is at position 3? Then ✓? We know R is either at 3 or 5? \n      E: ✓ because position 4.\n      D: ...\n\nBut if the feedback shows:\n  If L is not at position 1? But then we get \'-\', meaning L is in the word but not at 1? \n\nSimilarly, if R is not at position 3? We get \'-\'? But we know R must be at 3 or 5? If not at 3, then it must be at 5.\n\nAnd U and D would tell us.\n\nBut we have only 6 guesses? So we can be strategic.\n\nAlternatively, we can guess a word that has E at 4? And doesn\'t commit to a particular scenario? But still tests L at 1 or 2? \n\nFor example, put L at 1? and not fix R at 3? Because R could be at 5? Then if L is at 1? We get ✓ for L? \n\nBut the word should have R at either 3 or 5? Let\'s try to guess a word that has L at 1? E at 4? And R at 5? For example, ""LIBER""?\n\nIf we guess ""LIBER"":\n\n  Pattern: L at 1, R at 5? E at 4? Then if the secret word fits pattern D? However, if the secret word is ""LURED"", then ""LIBER"" would be: \n      L: ✓ (because both at 1)\n      I: we don\'t know? \n      B: absent? \n      E: ✓ at 4.\n      R: at 5? But in ""LURED"", R is at 3? So R at 5 in ""LIBER"" may be marked as \'x\' if the secret word is ""LURED""? But no: R is in the word? And in ""LURED"", R is at 3, so in ""LIBER"", R at 5 would be present but not at 5, so \'-\', meaning the secret word has R but not at 5? That would tell us that R is not at 5? So then it must be at 3.\n\nThen we know R is at 3? And L at 1? So pattern A? Then next guess ""LURED"".\n\nBut that uses two guesses.\n\nBut if we guess ""LURED"" now, and if it\'s correct, we win in three?

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
  Absent: C, A, N
  Present: R, E (R not at position 2, E not at position 5)

Guess 2: roles -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) L(-) E(✓) S(x)
  Absent: O, S   (so total absent: C, A, N, O, S)
  Present: R, L (R not at position 1, L not at position 3)
  E is correct at position 4.

Guess 3: lured -> FEEDBACK: L(-) U(x) R(-) E(✓) D(x)
  Absent: U, D   (total absent: C,A,N,O,S,U,D)
  Present: L, R -> L is not at position 1? And R not at position 3?
    Specifically: 
      L at position 1: '-', meaning L is in the word but not at position 1.
      U: absent
      R at position 3: '-', meaning R is in the word but not at position 3.
      E: correct at position 4.
      D: absent.

So now we have:

- E is fixed at position 4: _ _ _ E _
- Present letters: R, E, L
- E is at 4, so the other letters are R and L and two more? We know R, E, L are in the word? And we have five letters? But three known? So we must have five distinct letters? So two more letters that are not absent.

Total absent: C, A, N, O, S, U, D. That leaves a lot: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Constraints:

From the feedback:
  - R is present but not at positions 1 (from roles), 2 (from crane), and 3 (from lured). Therefore, R must be at position 5? Because positions 1,2,3 are ruled out, and 4 is E? So only position 5 remains.
  That means R is at position 5: so the word ends with R. Pattern: _ _ _ E R.

Similarly, for L:
  - Not at position 3 (from roles) and not at position 1 (from lured). So L must be at position 2? Because positions 1 and 3 are ruled out? And position 4 is E? Position 5 is R? So L must be at position 2? The only possibility left? But we have positions 1,2,3,4,5? Position 4 is E, position 5 is R? So L can be at position 2? Or what about position 3? But position 3 was ruled out only by Guess 2? But if L is at 3? Then in Guess 2 we put L at 3 and got '-', meaning L is present but not at position 3? That constraint applies to the secret word? So L cannot be at 3? Therefore, L must be at position 2? Because positions 1 and 3 are forbidden? And positions 4 and 5 are taken? So only position 2 is left? 

Therefore, L must be at position 2? So the pattern is: _ L _ E R.

The secret word has:
  Position 1: unknown (but not absent letters, and not R, E, L? because we assume distinct)
  Position 2: L
  Position 3: unknown
  Position 4: E
  Position 5: R

We know the letter at position 1 and position 3 must be from the remaining letters? And not absent? So not C,A,N,O,S,U,D? Also, they must be letters that form a valid word.

The word pattern: ? L ? E R

We need to fill positions 1 and 3 with two letters that are not in the absent list? And form a word.

Possible words? For example:
  ""BLUER"" -> but U is absent? and D? No, U is absent? So skip? BLUER has U? But U is absent? So we cannot use U? And BLUER has U? So invalid.
  ""FLIER"" -> F, L, I, E, R -> positions: F at 1, L at 2, I at 3, E at 4, R at 5? So it fits the pattern? And letters: F,L,I,E,R? F and I are not absent? So possible.
  ""PLIER"" -> P,L,I,E,R -> same.
  ""GLIER"" -> G,L,I,E,R? Is that a word? Meaning to squint? Probably archaic? But let's accept.
  ""ALI?R"" but A is absent? 
  ""H?"" for position 1? For example: ""HLI?R""? Not English? 

Common words: 
  ""FLIER"": a bird or something that flies? Valid.
  ""PLIER"": a tool? Valid.

Also, ""TRIER"" -> but T at 1, R at 3? But R cannot be at 3? Because we have position 3 as unknown? But in this case, R would be at 3? But we know R is at position 5? So we cannot have two R? Because we assumed distinct? And the feedback doesn't suggest duplicates? So we should avoid? Unless we see evidence of duplicate letters? But we haven't? So for now, assume distinct? Then ""TRIER"" would have two R? so invalid? Because the first R would be at position 3? and second at 5? But the secret word has only one R? Actually, feedback didn't say anything about duplicates? But we haven't encountered duplicate? 

But to avoid confusion, let's stick to distinct letters? And since we haven't seen any duplicate during feedback? We assume no duplicate? So in ""TRIER"", there would be two R? which violates? So skip.

Similarly, ""SKIER"" -> S is absent? Skip.

So the probable words are: ""FLIER"", ""PLIER"", ""GLIER"", and maybe others with other letters.

We now have to make a fourth guess? We can guess one of these? Since we have a fixed pattern.

But we need to include? We know L at 2? E at 4? R at 5? And position 1 and 3 to be filled? 

For the fourth guess, we can try ""flier""? or ""plier""? 

Let's choose a common one: ""flier"" and ""plier"" are common? We can choose ""plier"" because it has P? which may be less common? Or choose ""flier"" for F?

But we have to choose: let's try ""flier"".

Alternatively, we can try a word that includes more new letters? But we have to fit the pattern? However, we might also consider that the word could be ""something else"" that fits the pattern? We must choose a valid English word.

We don't have much information on the remaining letters? So we can guess a word that uses common letters for positions 1 and 3? For example, F and I? Or P and I? Etc.

To narrow down, we can try ""flier"" or just guess ""plier"". 

I will choose ""flier"" for the fourth guess.

But note: the word ""flier"" fits the pattern: F at 1, L at 2, I at 3, E at 4, R at 5? Exactly the pattern.

Similarly, ""plier"" also fits.

But we want to make a guess? We can pick one? 

Alternatively, if we guess ""flier"", we might win? Or get new information? So let's try.

Therefore, guess ""flier"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from all guesses:

- **Absent Letters (x):** C, A, N, O, S, U, D  
- **Position Constraints:**  
  - **E** is **fixed at position 4** (confirmed by Guess 2 and 3).
  - **R** is present but **not at positions 1, 2, or 3** (ruled out by Guess 2 and 3). Thus, R must be at position 5.
  - **L** is present but **not at positions 1 or 3** (ruled out by Guess 2 and 3). Since positions 4–5 are taken, L must be at position 2.
- **Secret Word Pattern:** \_ L \_ E R  
- **Remaining Letters:** Must fill positions 1 and 3 with valid English letters not in the absent list (e.g., B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z).

**Deductions:**  
The secret word is a 5-letter word matching the pattern \_ L \_ E R. Common words fitting this pattern include **FLIER** (meaning ""one who flies""), **PLIER** (meaning ""a tool""), **GLIER** (archaic for ""squinting""), etc.  

**Strategy for Guess 4:**  
Test **""FLIER""** because:  
- It fits the deduced pattern (F at position 1, L at 2, I at 3, E at 4, R at 5).  
- Uses common letters (F, I) to maximize discovery of new information.  
- If incorrect, feedback (e.g., F or I marked ""x"" or ""-"") will reveal the missing letters and narrow options further.  

<guess>flier</guess>",flier,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
  Absent: C, A, N
  Present: R, E (R not at position 2, E not at position 5)

Guess 2: roles -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) L(-) E(✓) S(x)
  Absent: O, S   (so total absent: C, A, N, O, S)
  Present: R, L (R not at position 1, L not at position 3)
  E is correct at position 4.

Guess 3: lured -> FEEDBACK: L(-) U(x) R(-) E(✓) D(x)
  Absent: U, D   (total absent: C,A,N,O,S,U,D)
  Present: L, R -> L is not at position 1? And R not at position 3?
    Specifically: 
      L at position 1: '-', meaning L is in the word but not at position 1.
      U: absent
      R at position 3: '-', meaning R is in the word but not at position 3.
      E: correct at position 4.
      D: absent.

So now we have:

- E is fixed at position 4: _ _ _ E _
- Present letters: R, E, L
- E is at 4, so the other letters are R and L and two more? We know R, E, L are in the word? And we have five letters? But three known? So we must have five distinct letters? So two more letters that are not absent.

Total absent: C, A, N, O, S, U, D. That leaves a lot: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Constraints:

From the feedback:
  - R is present but not at positions 1 (from roles), 2 (from crane), and 3 (from lured). Therefore, R must be at position 5? Because positions 1,2,3 are ruled out, and 4 is E? So only position 5 remains.
  That means R is at position 5: so the word ends with R. Pattern: _ _ _ E R.

Similarly, for L:
  - Not at position 3 (from roles) and not at position 1 (from lured). So L must be at position 2? Because positions 1 and 3 are ruled out? And position 4 is E? Position 5 is R? So L must be at position 2? The only possibility left? But we have positions 1,2,3,4,5? Position 4 is E, position 5 is R? So L can be at position 2? Or what about position 3? But position 3 was ruled out only by Guess 2? But if L is at 3? Then in Guess 2 we put L at 3 and got '-', meaning L is present but not at position 3? That constraint applies to the secret word? So L cannot be at 3? Therefore, L must be at position 2? Because positions 1 and 3 are forbidden? And positions 4 and 5 are taken? So only position 2 is left? 

Therefore, L must be at position 2? So the pattern is: _ L _ E R.

The secret word has:
  Position 1: unknown (but not absent letters, and not R, E, L? because we assume distinct)
  Position 2: L
  Position 3: unknown
  Position 4: E
  Position 5: R

We know the letter at position 1 and position 3 must be from the remaining letters? And not absent? So not C,A,N,O,S,U,D? Also, they must be letters that form a valid word.

The word pattern: ? L ? E R

We need to fill positions 1 and 3 with two letters that are not in the absent list? And form a word.

Possible words? For example:
  ""BLUER"" -> but U is absent? and D? No, U is absent? So skip? BLUER has U? But U is absent? So we cannot use U? And BLUER has U? So invalid.
  ""FLIER"" -> F, L, I, E, R -> positions: F at 1, L at 2, I at 3, E at 4, R at 5? So it fits the pattern? And letters: F,L,I,E,R? F and I are not absent? So possible.
  ""PLIER"" -> P,L,I,E,R -> same.
  ""GLIER"" -> G,L,I,E,R? Is that a word? Meaning to squint? Probably archaic? But let's accept.
  ""ALI?R"" but A is absent? 
  ""H?"" for position 1? For example: ""HLI?R""? Not English? 

Common words: 
  ""FLIER"": a bird or something that flies? Valid.
  ""PLIER"": a tool? Valid.

Also, ""TRIER"" -> but T at 1, R at 3? But R cannot be at 3? Because we have position 3 as unknown? But in this case, R would be at 3? But we know R is at position 5? So we cannot have two R? Because we assumed distinct? And the feedback doesn't suggest duplicates? So we should avoid? Unless we see evidence of duplicate letters? But we haven't? So for now, assume distinct?

Similarly, ""SKIER"" -> S is absent? Skip.

So the probable words are: ""FLIER"", ""PLIER"", ""GLIER"", and maybe others with other letters.

We now have to make a fourth guess? We can guess one of these? Since we have a fixed pattern.

But we need to include? We know L at 2? E at 4? R at 5? And position 1 and 3 to be filled? 

For the fourth guess, we can try ""flier""? or ""plier""? 

Let's choose a common one: ""flier"" and ""plier"" are common? We can choose ""plier"" because it has P? which may be less common? Or choose ""flier"" for F?

But we have to choose: let's try ""flier"".

Alternatively, we can try a word that includes more new letters? But we have to fit the pattern? However, we might also consider that the word could be ""something else"" that fits the pattern? We must choose a valid English word.

We don't have much information on the remaining letters? So we can guess a word that uses common letters for positions 1 and 3? For example, F and I? Or P and I? Etc.

To narrow down, we can try ""flier"" or just guess ""plier"". 

I will choose ""flier"" for the fourth guess.

But note: the word ""flier"" fits the pattern: F at 1, L at 2, I at 3, E at 4, R at 5? Exactly the pattern.

Similarly, ""plier"" also fits.

But we want to make a guess? We can pick one? 

Alternatively, if we guess ""flier"", we might win? Or get new information? So let's try.

Therefore, guess ""flier"".Based on the feedback from all guesses:

- **Absent Letters (x):** C, A, N, O, S, U, D  
- **Position Constraints:**  
  - **E** is **fixed at position 4** (confirmed by Guess 2 and 3).

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,5,FLYER,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R was in position 2 and E in position 5 of ""crane"", so in the secret word:
     R is not at position 2.
     E is not at position 5.

 - The letters C, A, N are not in the word at all.

 We also know the secret word is 5 letters.

 Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
   - Does not contain C, A, N (since they are absent).
   - Includes R and E (since they are present) but in different positions than in the first guess.
   - We might also want to include other common letters to test.

 Let's think about the positions:
   In ""crane"", the positions are:
     1: C (absent)
     2: R (present but wrong position) -> so R must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? Actually, no: we know it's not at 2, but it could be at 1,3,4,5? However, note that in the feedback, we have a '-' for R meaning it is in the word but not at position 2. Similarly, E is not at position 5.

 But note: the feedback doesn't tell us that R cannot be at position 1,3,4,5? Actually, it can be at any position except 2. Similarly, E can be at any position except 5.

 However, we must also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But the rules don't specify, so we assume no duplicates unless feedback suggests otherwise. But in this feedback, we don't have any duplicates.

 Now, for the second guess, we want to try to place R and E in new positions and also test new letters.

 We know the word has R and E. Let's try to think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N.

 Also, we want to cover more common letters. Common consonants besides R: T, L, S, etc. Common vowels: we have E, and we know A is absent, so other vowels: O, I, U? But we have E already.

 Let's try to form a word:

 We know:
   Position 1: cannot be C (absent) and we don't know about others. But we can try to put R at position 1? Or E? Or a new letter.

 Since R is in the word and not at position 2, let's try putting R at position 1. And E is not at position 5, so let's put E at position 4? Or 3? We have to choose.

 Also, we need to avoid positions that we know are wrong for R and E? Actually, we only know that R is not at 2 and E is not at 5. So:

   For R: allowed positions: 1, 3, 4, 5.
   For E: allowed positions: 1, 2, 3, 4.

 We can try to put R at position 1 and E at position 3? Or position 4? 

 Let's think of words that start with R and have E in the middle.

 Example: ""REBEL"" -> but that has E at position 2 and 4? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have to avoid A and C and N.

 But note: we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. The rules don't forbid it, but we haven't seen any feedback suggesting duplicates. So we should avoid assuming duplicates until necessary.

 Alternatively, let's try a word that has R at position 1 and E at position 4? 

 Example: ""ROUTE"" -> but we don't know if O and U and T are in the word? Also, we have E at position 5? But wait, in ""ROUTE"", E is at position 5, which we know is not allowed for E (because in the first guess E was at position 5 and got a '-', meaning E is in the word but not at position 5). So we cannot put E at position 5.

 So we need E at positions 1,2,3, or 4.

 Let me try: ""RESTY"" -> R at 1, E at 2, S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5. But we don't know if S, T, Y are in the word? And we are testing new letters.

 However, note that in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and now we are putting R at position 1. That's allowed because the feedback only said R is not at position 2.

 Similarly, E was at position 5 and now we put it at position 2.

 But wait: what if the word has two R's? We don't know. But we can try.

 Alternatively, we can avoid putting R at position 1 and try a different position? But we have to test.

 Another idea: we know the word has R and E. We can try to put R at position 3 and E at position 1? For example: ""PERKY"" -> P, E, R, K, Y.

 But we don't know if P, K, Y are in the word? And we are avoiding C, A, N.

 However, we have to test new letters.

 Let me list some words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N:

   - R at position 1: 
        R E _ _ _ -> e.g., ""RESET"" (but duplicate E? and we don't know if duplicates are allowed) -> but we don't want to assume duplicates. Also, we have to avoid A and C and N.
        ""REBUS"" -> R E B U S -> but E is at position 2? and we don't know about B, U, S.

   - R at position 3:
        _ _ R E _ -> e.g., ""BORED"" -> but O is new? and D is new. Also, E is at position 4? which is allowed.

   - R at position 4:
        _ _ _ R E -> but E is at position 5? which is not allowed. So we cannot put E at 5. So if we put R at 4, then E must be at 1,2,3? but then we have two positions to fill? 

        Example: _ _ _ R _ and then put E at 1: ""E _ _ R _"", e.g., ""EVERY"" -> but duplicate E? and we don't know.

   - R at position 5: 
        _ _ _ _ R, and E at one of 1,2,3,4. Example: ""LATER"" -> but L, T, E, R -> but E is at position 4? and R at 5. But we have to avoid A? ""LATER"" has A which is absent! So we cannot use A.

        Without A: ""TIGER"" -> T I G E R -> E at position 4? and R at 5. But we don't know about T, I, G.

 Considering the above, let's try to choose a word that:

   - Contains R and E (since we know they are in the word).
   - Avoids C, A, N (absent letters).
   - Puts R in a new position (not position 2) and E in a new position (not position 5).
   - Uses common letters to maximize information.

 One candidate: ""ROGUE"" -> R at 1, O, G, U, E at 5? -> but E at 5 is not allowed. So skip.

 Another: ""RIPER"" -> duplicate R? and we don't know. Also, E at position 5? not allowed.

 How about ""ROBES""? -> R at 1, O, B, E at 4, S at 5. 
   E is at position 4 (allowed) and R at 1 (allowed). 
   Letters: R, O, B, E, S. We avoid C, A, N.

 But note: we don't know if O, B, S are in the word? This is a good test.

 Alternatively, ""RESTY"": R at 1, E at 2, S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5. 
   E is at position 2 (allowed) and R at 1 (allowed). 
   We test S, T, Y.

 Another common word: ""TRIED"" -> T, R, I, E, D. 
   R is at position 2? But wait, we know R is in the word but not at position 2. So we cannot put R at position 2 again? 
   Actually, we can put R at position 2? But the feedback told us that in the first guess R was at position 2 and that was wrong. So in the secret word, R is not at position 2. Therefore, in our new guess, if we put R at position 2, then we know it will be marked as '-' again? Because the secret word does not have R at position 2. But we already know that. So it's a waste of a position? 

   We want to test R in a new position to see if we can get a '✓'. So it's better to put R in a position we haven't tried and that is allowed (1,3,4,5). Similarly for E.

 In ""TRIED"", R is at position 2? That would be the same as the first guess? And we know it's not at 2. So we avoid that.

 How about ""DRIVE""? -> D, R, I, V, E. 
   R is at position 2? Again, same problem.

 We need to avoid position 2 for R.

 Let me try: ""PRICE"" -> but C is absent? We cannot use C.

 Without C: ""PRIDE"" -> P, R, I, D, E. 
   R is at position 2? Again, position 2 for R is not allowed? We know R is not at position 2 in the secret word. So if we put R at position 2, we will get a '-' again. But we are trying to find the correct position. So we should avoid position 2 for R.

 How about ""PERIL""? -> P, E, R, I, L. 
   R is at position 3 (which is allowed) and E at position 2 (which is allowed for E? yes, because E was only forbidden at position 5). 
   Letters: P, E, R, I, L. We avoid C, A, N.

 This seems good.

 Another candidate: ""BERYL"" -> B, E, R, Y, L. 
   E at position 2, R at position 3. 
   But we don't know about B, Y, L.

 However, note: we have already used E at position 2? But that's okay because we are testing.

 But wait: in the first guess, we had E at position 5 and got a '-'. Now we are putting E at position 2. If the secret word has E at position 2, we'll get a '✓'. If not, we'll get a '-'. Similarly for R at position 3.

 I think ""PERIL"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and tests new positions.

 Alternatively, ""ROUSE"": R at 1, O, U, S, E at 5? -> E at 5 is not allowed.

 How about ""ROLES"": R at 1, O, L, E at 4, S at 5? 
   E is at position 4? That's allowed. 
   So: R(1), O(2), L(3), E(4), S(5). 

 This is also a candidate.

 But note: we have to avoid using the same letter in the same position if we know it's wrong? We don't have any other constraints.

 Let me compare:

   ""PERIL"": tests positions: 
        P at 1 (new)
        E at 2 (new for E, since E was at 5 before)
        R at 3 (new for R, since R was at 2 before)
        I at 4 (new)
        L at 5 (new)

   ""ROLES"": 
        R at 1 (new for R)
        O at 2 (new)
        L at 3 (new)
        E at 4 (new for E, since E was at 5 before)
        S at 5 (new)

 Both are valid. But we want to cover more common consonants. The letters in ""PERIL"": P, E, R, I, L. Common letters: E, R, L, I, P.
 The letters in ""ROLES"": R, O, L, E, S. Common letters: R, O, L, E, S.

 Since S and O are very common, maybe ""ROLES"" is better? But we also have L and E in both.

 However, we already know R and E are in the word, so we are confirming their positions. The other letters (O, L, S) are common and we haven't tested them.

 I think ""ROLES"" is a good choice.

 But wait: what if the secret word has E at position 4? Then we get a '✓' for E. Similarly, if R is at position 1, we get a '✓'. 

 Alternatively, we might get '-' for R and E if they are in the word but not at these positions.

 Let's go with ""ROLES"".

 However, note: we are not forced to use R and E? Actually, we must use them because we know they are in the word? But the rules don't require that we use known letters? But if we don't use them, we won't get information about their positions. So it's better to use them.

 So I decide: ""ROLES""

 But let me check: is ""ROLES"" a valid word? Yes.

 Therefore, second guess: ""ROLES""

<guess>roles</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and N are **absent** (marked ""x"").
- R is **present** but not in position 2 (marked ""-"").
- E is **present** but not in position 5 (marked ""-"").

For the second guess:
- Must include **R** and **E** (since they are in the secret word).
- Avoid C, A, and N.
- Place R in a new position (not 2): options are 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- Place E in a new position (not 5): options are 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- Test new common letters (like S, O, L) to gather more information.

Chose **""ROLES""** because:
- R is at position 1 (new position for R).
- E is at position 4 (new position for E).
- Tests new letters: O, L, S (common consonants).
- Avoids C, A, N.

<guess>roles</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: roles -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) L(-) E(✓) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
  Meaning:
    - C, A, N are absent.
    - R is present (but not in position 2).
    - E is present (but not in position 5).

Guess 2: roles -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) L(-) E(✓) S(x)
  Meaning:
    - R is present but not in position 1 (because we put R at position 1 and got ""-"" meaning wrong position).
    - O is absent (since ""x"").
    - L is present but not in position 3 (because we put L at position 3 and got ""-"").
    - E is in the word and in the correct position (position 4) because ""✓"".
    - S is absent (since ""x"").

So from both guesses, we now know:

Absent letters: C, A, N, O, S
Present letters: R, E, L
  - E is fixed at position 4 (since we have E(✓) at position 4 in ""roles"").

Also, from Guess 1: E is present but not at position 5 -> but now we know E is at position 4, so that's consistent.

Positions we know:
  - E must be at position 4: so the word is _ _ _ E _

Constraints on R:
  - From Guess 1: R is not at position 2.
  - From Guess 2: R is not at position 1.

So R must be at position 3 or 5? (since position 2 and 1 are ruled out). The positions are 1,2,3,4,5. But position 4 is E, so R cannot be at position 4. Therefore, R must be at position 3 or 5.

Similarly, L is present but not at position 3 (from Guess 2). So L must be at position 1, 2, or 5? But note: if R is at position 5, then L can be at 1 or 2? Or vice versa.

We also have the present letters: R, E, L. And we know E is at 4.

Now, the word has 5 letters, so there are two more letters we don't know? But we only know 3 present letters? Actually, the word must have two more letters that we haven't discovered because the absent letters are C,A,N,O,S.

But note: we don't know if there are duplicates? We haven't encountered any duplicate feedback so far. The feedback for each letter is independent, and we haven't seen a letter appear twice in feedback? Actually, we only have one instance of R and one of E and one of L. So probably no duplicates.

So the secret word has 5 distinct letters: three we know (R, E, L) and two more that are not among the absent letters (C,A,N,O,S). 

The English alphabet has 26 letters. The absent letters are C,A,N,O,S. So the remaining possible letters are: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,M,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

We also know R is at position 3 or 5, and L is at position 1,2, or 5? But note: if R is at position 5, then position 5 is taken by R, so L cannot be at 5. Similarly, if R is at position 3, then L can be at 1,2,5? But position 5 is available.

So let's break it down.

Case 1: R at position 3, then L must be at 1,2, or 5? But we know L is not at position 3 (from ""roles"" feedback), which is already taken by R? But in this case, position 3 is R so L isn't there, which is consistent. So L can be at 1,2, or 5? However, we must assign L to one of these.

Case 2: R at position 5, then L can be at position 1 or 2? Because position 5 is taken by R, and position 3 is not L (from feedback) and position 4 is E.

Now, we need to form a 5-letter word that fits:

The pattern: _ _ _ E _  and we know:
  - E at 4.
  - R either at 3 or 5.
  - L at one of the remaining positions: if R at 3 then L at 1,2,5? But if R is at 3, then position 3 is R, so L must be at 1,2, or 5. But if we put L at 5, then position 5 is L? Then R would be at 3? That's fine.

Alternatively, if R is at 5, then position 5 is R, and L must be at 1 or 2.

So possible scenarios:

Scenario A: R at position 3, L at position 1: pattern: L _ R E _
Scenario B: R at position 3, L at position 2: pattern: _ L R E _
Scenario C: R at position 3, L at position 5: pattern: _ _ R E L
Scenario D: R at position 5, L at position 1: pattern: L _ _ E R
Scenario E: R at position 5, L at position 2: pattern: _ L _ E R

Now, we need to fill in the other positions with letters that are not absent (so not C, A, N, O, S) and not R,E,L (since we assume no duplicates?).

We should choose a word that tests as many of these possibilities as possible? But we have to pick one word.

Alternatively, we can try to find a word that fits one of these patterns and uses common letters.

Let's try to form words for each pattern:

Pattern A: L _ R E _
  We need a letter for position 2 and position 5.
  Example: LIBRE? but I and B? But we don't know if I or B is in the word? But LIBRE is a word? Yes, meaning free.

Pattern B: _ L R E _
  Example: BLARE? But B,L,A,R,E -> but A is absent? so invalid. 
  Another: FLARE? F,L,A,R,E -> A absent? Also invalid.
  Without A: GLARE? G,L,A,R,E -> A absent? Same.
  FLIER? FLIER is F,L,I,E,R -> positions: F at 1, L at 2, I at 3? But we need R at 3? But here I is at 3 and R at 5? That doesn't match because pattern must have R at 3: so pattern B: first letter unknown, then L at 2, R at 3, E at 4, then last letter.
  So: positions: 1: ?, 2: L, 3: R, 4: E, 5: ?
  Example words: 
      ULREE? not a word.
      PLIER? P,L,I,E,R -> but that would be P at 1, L at 2, I at 3? But we require R at 3? So if we have L at 2 and R at 3, then word must be ?LRE?
      PLRE? not 5 letters.
      ALERT? but A is absent.
      Let me think: ""ELVER"" -> E L V E R? But L at 2? And R at 5? And we have two E's? Not matching pattern B? 
      Another: ""BLUER"" -> B L U E R -> but that has U at 3? Not R at 3? 
      Actually, ""R"" is required at position 3? So ?LRE? 
      Words: 
        ""FLIER"" doesn't work because it has I at 3, not R.
        ""PLIER"" has I at 3? Not R.
        ""ALERT"" has A (absent) and E at position 2? Not L at 2? 
      I can't find a common word for pattern B? 

Pattern C: _ _ R E L
  Example: ""MOREL"" -> but M,O,R,E,L -> O is absent? So invalid.
          ""BAREL"" -> B,A,R,E,L -> A absent? invalid.
          ""QUREL"" -> not a word.
          ""TAREL"" -> T,A,R,E,L -> A absent? invalid.
          ""FIREL"" -> F,I,R,E,L -> which is F at 1, I at 2, R at 3, E at 4, L at 5. That matches? And letters: F,I,R,E,L. Absent letters? F and I are not absent? So ""FIREL"" is not a word? 
          ""Beryl"" is B,E,R,Y,L -> but that has E at position 2? Not position 4? And we have E fixed at position 4.

      For pattern C: positions 1 and 2 unknown, then R at 3, E at 4, L at 5. So ? ? R E L.
      Words: 
          ""CAREL"" -> C is absent? invalid.
          ""MIRREL"" -> not 5 letters.
          ""SOREL"" -> S,O,R,E,L -> O and S are absent? invalid.
          ""HAREL"" -> H,A,R,E,L -> A absent? invalid.
      I don't find an obvious word for pattern C? Maybe not common.

Pattern D: L _ _ E R
  Example: ""LIGER"" -> L,I,G,E,R -> which is L at 1, I at 2, G at 3, E at 4, R at 5. That fits.
  Another: ""LOWER"" -> L,O,W,E,R -> but O is absent? invalid.
  ""LUBER"" -> not a word? 
  ""LIBER"" -> L,I,B,E,R -> that's a word? It exists? meaning free? Yes, LIBER.

Pattern E: _ L _ E R
  Example: ""BLUER"" -> B,L,U,E,R -> but U at position 3? And R at 5? So pattern: B, L, U, E, R -> position 1: B, 2: L, 3: U, 4: E, 5: R. That's pattern E? Yes.
  Another: ""PLIER""? P,L,I,E,R -> but I at 3? same.

But note: pattern D and E are similar? Pattern D has L at 1, pattern E has L at 2.

So we have:
  Pattern A: L _ R E _ -> e.g., LIBRE? But LIBRE has L at 1, I at 2, R at 3, E at 4? And the last position? LIBRE is 5 letters? L-I-B-R-E? That’s positions: L at 1, I at 2, B at 3, R at 4? Actually, that doesn't fit because we require R at 3? 

  Correction: For pattern A: L at 1, then letter at 2, then R at 3, E at 4, then letter at 5.
      LIBRE: L (1), I (2), B (3), R (4)? -> doesn't work because R is at position 4? But we need R at 3? 
      Actually, if we define the pattern: positions: 1: L, 2: ?, 3: R, 4: E, 5: ?.
      Example: ""LIBER""? L,I,B,E,R -> that has R at position 5? Not at 3? 
      To have R at 3: ""LURE?"" -> L,U,R,E? That's only 4 letters? 
      ""LURED"" -> L, U, R, E, D -> positions: L at 1, U at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5. That fits? And D is not absent? 

  So ""LURED"" is a word? Yes.

  Pattern A: L, U, R, E, D -> word ""LURED"".

Pattern D: L,I,G,E,R -> ""LIGER"" is a word? Yes, meaning a cross between lion and tiger? But also ""TIGER"" might be? But TIGER has T at ? T,I,G,E,R -> which is pattern E? 

But we cannot use A, O, S, N, C.

So possible words we identified:
  Pattern A: ""LURED"" -> L,U,R,E,D
  Pattern D: ""LIBER"" -> L,I,B,E,R   [but note: R at position 5?] -> pattern: L at 1, I at 2, B at 3, E at 4, R at 5. But we have E at 4? Correct. And R at 5? And L at 1? This is pattern D: L _ _ E R -> so _ in position 2 and 3: so I and B? Then for pattern D: we have L, ?, ?, E, R -> positions: 1:L, 2:?, 3:?, 4:E, 5:R.

Actually, pattern D: L _ _ E R -> two letters in the middle.

Similarly, pattern E: _ L _ E R -> one letter at start and one in the middle.

So ""LIBER"" is pattern D: L at 1, I at 2, B at 3, E at 4, R at 5? Then yes? That's L (1), I (2), B (3), E (4), R (5). So matches pattern D.

But note: pattern D requires L at 1 and R at 5? Exactly.

Similarly, pattern A: ""LURED"" -> L at 1, U at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5? So in pattern A we have R at 3? So that is scenario A: R at 3, L at 1? Yes.

But we also have pattern E: ""BLUER"" -> B,L,U,E,R -> but U is at 3? And L at 2? So it matches pattern E? But we have R at 5? And E at 4? So _ L _ E R: B at 1, L at 2, U at 3, E at 4, R at 5? So exactly.

But now we have: 
  Scenario A: LURED (if it is valid)
  Scenario D: LIBER, LURER (but duplicate R? we don't know? and LURER may not be a word? Probably not) -> LIGER?
  Scenario E: BLUER, FLIER, PLIER? But FLIER and PLIER have I at 3? And they end with R? PLIER has P, L, I, E, R? Yes? That's pattern E: P at 1, L at 2, I at 3, E at 4, R at 5.

Now, with the feedback we don't have duplicates? So we can assume no duplicates? 

We need to choose a third guess that helps us differentiate the scenarios.

But note: we know E is at 4? And R is at 3 or 5? And L is at 1, 2, or 5? But depending on R.

We can try to choose a word that covers some of these possibilities and tests common letters.

However, we know from the present letters: R, E, L and E fixed at 4. And we need to find two more letters? 

We can try to pick a word that includes L and R? And E? And tests positions? But we have to choose one.

But note: we also have constraints:

  - R cannot be at position 1 or 2 (from past feedback). 
  - L cannot be at position 3 (from Guess 2).

And we know E is at 4.

So let's try to find a word that fits the pattern that might be the solution? Or one that gives us more information.

But we don't have enough constraints to pin down the word? We have five possible patterns? 

Alternatively, we might guess a word that tests one of the possibilities? For example, if we guess ""LURED"", that would tell us if the pattern A is correct.

But maybe we should choose a word that doesn't depend on the unknown letters? But we have to.

The known present letters are R, E, L? And two more are unknown? So if we guess a word that includes R, E, L and two new letters that we don't know? We can test them.

But we should avoid absent letters: C, A, N, O, S.

So let me propose a word that tests the position of R, L and includes E at 4? And two new letters.

Since E must be at 4, we can try to fix that.

The word must be * * E * ? With E at position 4.

And it must contain R and L? And avoid absent letters.

So structure: position 4: E, and positions 1,2,3,5: to be filled? With two of them being R and L? And the other two new letters? But we don't have to assign both R and L? Actually, we must because they are in the word.

We also know:
  R cannot be at 1 or 2? -> so R must be at 3 or 5? because position 1 and 2 are forbidden for R? And position 4 is E.

  Similarly, L cannot be at 3? -> so L must be at 1, 2, or 5? but if R is at 5, then L can be at 1 or 2? and if R is at 3, then L at 1,2,5? 

So we can consider:

Option 1: Put R at position 3? 
  Then word: _ _ R E _ ? And L must be at 1, 2, or 5? But we also need two more letters? 
  Let’s pick common letters? For positions 1 and 2: we can pick common consonants or vowels? For position 5: one letter.

  We need to choose a word that has L at either 1, 2, or 5 and R at 3.

  Example: word with L at 1: pattern L _ R E ? 
      L? R E ? -> letters: L at 1, R at 3, E at 4, and positions 2 and 5: two new letters.
      Example: ""LURED"" (as before): L,U,R,E,D -> but U and D? 
      Or ""LIBER"" wouldn't work because R is at 4? Or ""LIBER"" has R at 5, not at 3? 

  Actually, ""LIBER"" has R at 5? Can we find a word like L? R E ?? 
      ""LAREE"" -> A absent? invalid.
      ""LIRE?"" not 5 letters.
      ""LURED"" is one.

Option 2: Put R at position 5?
  Then word: _ _ _ E R? And L must be at 1 or 2? Because it cannot be at 3? And 4 is E, and 5 is R? So L must be at 1 or 2.

  Example: 
      If L at 1: L ? ? E R -> e.g., ""LIBER"": L,I,B,E,R -> which is pattern D.
      If L at 2: ? L ? E R -> e.g., ""BLUER"" (if not absent letters) but U is acceptable? Or ""PLIER"": P,L,I,E,R? Or ""ALERT"" with A absent? Not.

But in our case, ""BLUER"" has letter B,L,U,E,R? B and U are not absent? So okay? And ""PLIER"" has P,L,I,E,R.

To maximize new letters, I am considering trying ""LURED"". 

But first, suppose we guess ""LURED"":
  That covers:
    L at 1? So if L is at 1? And R at 3? And E at 4? 
  The word is L,U,R,E,D.

This would be matching scenario A: R at position 3, L at position 1? 

If it is the secret word, we win? But we are on the third guess.

If not, we get feedback? 

Alternatively, if we want to test both R positions, we can try a word that has R at 5? and L at 1? But E at 4? For example, ""LIBER"" (but we have to make sure the other letters are not absent?).

But note: we have two possible groupings:

We can split the possibilities by choosing a word that forces differentiation.

Or, we can try to find a word that fits one of the scenarios and uses common letters? 

Maybe ""TRIBE"" but T,R,I,B,E -> and T,R,I,B,E at: T at 1, R at 2? But R cannot be at 2? so we must avoid.

Another idea: we know E is at 4? Let's choose a word that puts L and R in permitted positions and tests new common letters? For example, include T.

What is common? Let's try: Pattern: _ _ _ E R? And put L at 2? Then it becomes: ? L ? E R.

And choose common letters: B and I? That would be ""BLIER""? B,L,I,E,R? Is that a word? Blier means more blue? Not common? ""PLIER"" is more common.

Or ""S?"" but S is absent.

How about ""GLUER""? G and U? But that's pattern? G,L,U,E,R -> which is _ L _ E R? So L at 2, U at 3? And R at 5? E at 4? So if we guess ""GLUER""? Or ""G"" may be okay? Then the word is G,L,U,E,R.

But let me check: absent letters are C,A,O,N,S? So G, U are okay.

But I don't know if ""GLUER"" is common? Also, what about ""TILER""? T,I,L,E,R -> T at 1, I at 2, L at 3? But L at 3? We know L cannot be at position 3? Because in ""roles"", L was at position 3 and we got '-', meaning L is in the word but not at position 3? So we cannot put L at 3.

So we must avoid L at 3? In ""TILER"", L is at 3? Which is not allowed? Because feedback said L in ""roles"" at position 3 got '-', so it cannot be at 3 in the secret word.

Similarly, we must avoid L at 3? So any guess we make, if we put L at 3? It would be marked as '-', which we already know? So we should avoid wasting a position? Unless we want to confirm.

But we already know it? So it's redundant.

So back to our options:

I will choose to guess ""LURED"" to test pattern A? because it has L at 1, R at 3, E at 4? And tests U and D? Both new letters? 

If it's not the word, we get feedback: 

  If ""LURED"" is the secret we win.

  Otherwise:
  We might get:
      L: ✓ or -? If L is at position 1? Then we get ✓? 
      U: if U is in the word? We get - or x? 
      R: we put at 3? So if R is at position 3? Then ✓? We know R is either at 3 or 5? 
      E: ✓ because position 4.
      D: ...

But if the feedback shows:
  If L is not at position 1? But then we get '-', meaning L is in the word but not at 1? 

Similarly, if R is not at position 3? We get '-'? But we know R must be at 3 or 5? If not at 3, then it must be at 5.

And U and D would tell us.

But we have only 6 guesses? So we can be strategic.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that has E at 4? And doesn't commit to a particular scenario? But still tests L at 1 or 2? 

For example, put L at 1? and not fix R at 3? Because R could be at 5? Then if L is at 1? We get ✓ for L? 

But the word should have R at either 3 or 5? Let's try to guess a word that has L at 1? E at 4? And R at 5? For example, ""LIBER""?

If we guess ""LIBER"":

  Pattern: L at 1, R at 5? E at 4? Then if the secret word fits pattern D? However, if the secret word is ""LURED"", then ""LIBER"" would be: 
      L: ✓ (because both at 1)
      I: we don't know? 
      B: absent? 
      E: ✓ at 4.
      R: at 5? But in ""LURED"", R is at 3? So R at 5 in ""LIBER"" may be marked as 'x' if the secret word is ""LURED""? But no: R is in the word? And in ""LURED"", R is at 3, so in ""LIBER"", R at 5 would be present but not at 5, so '-', meaning the secret word has R but not at 5? That would tell us that R is not at 5? So then it must be at 3.

Then we know R is at 3? And L at 1? So pattern A? Then next guess ""LURED"".

But that uses two guesses.

But if we guess ""LURED"" now, and if it's correct, we win in three? If not, we still have information.

I think let's go with ""LURED"" for the third guess.

So the guessed word: ""lured""

But in uppercase? The rules say ""5-letter English word"" and previous guesses are in lowercase? So lowercase.

<guess>lured</guess>

Let me confirm: ""LURED"" has L at 1, U at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5? And positions: 
  L at 1 -> we don't know if L is at 1? 
  U at 2 -> new
  R at 3 -> we are testing if R is at 3?
  E at 4 -> known correct
  D at 5 -> new

This guess will give us feedback on L's position (if it is at 1? or not) and R's position (if at 3? or not) and also tell us about U and D.

If we get:
  L(?), U(?), R(?), E(✓), D(?)

And compare to the known present letters? 

So it's a good test.After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

- **C, A, N, O, S** are **absent** (marked ""x"").
- **E** is **correctly placed at position 4** (marked ""✓"" in ""roles"").
- **R** is **present** but not at position 1 or 2.
- **L** is **present** but not at position 3.

Deductions:
- E must be at position 4 (secret word pattern: \_ \_ \_ E \_).
- R must be at position 3 or 5 (since positions 1 and 2 are ruled out).
- L must be at position 1, 2, or 5 (since position 3 is ruled out).
- The secret word contains exactly 5 distinct letters (no duplicates indicated in feedback).
- Absent letters (C, A, N, O, S) must be excluded.

For the third guess, **""LURED""** is chosen because:
- Fits letter/position constraints: E at position 4.
- Tests R at position 3 and L at position 1.
- Uses new common letters (U, D) to gather additional information.
- Optimizes potential to confirm R and L positions while adhering to rules.

<guess>lured</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: roles -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) L(-) E(✓) S(x)
Guess 3: lured -> FEEDBACK: L(-) U(x) R(-) E(✓) D(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
  Absent: C, A, N
  Present: R, E (R not at position 2, E not at position 5)

Guess 2: roles -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) L(-) E(✓) S(x)
  Absent: O, S   (so total absent: C, A, N, O, S)
  Present: R, L (R not at position 1, L not at position 3)
  E is correct at position 4.

Guess 3: lured -> FEEDBACK: L(-) U(x) R(-) E(✓) D(x)
  Absent: U, D   (total absent: C,A,N,O,S,U,D)
  Present: L, R -> L is not at position 1? And R not at position 3?
    Specifically: 
      L at position 1: '-', meaning L is in the word but not at position 1.
      U: absent
      R at position 3: '-', meaning R is in the word but not at position 3.
      E: correct at position 4.
      D: absent.

So now we have:

- E is fixed at position 4: _ _ _ E _
- Present letters: R, E, L
- E is at 4, so the other letters are R and L and two more? We know R, E, L are in the word? And we have five letters? But three known? So we must have five distinct letters? So two more letters that are not absent.

Total absent: C, A, N, O, S, U, D. That leaves a lot: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Constraints:

From the feedback:
  - R is present but not at positions 1 (from roles), 2 (from crane), and 3 (from lured). Therefore, R must be at position 5? Because positions 1,2,3 are ruled out, and 4 is E? So only position 5 remains.
  That means R is at position 5: so the word ends with R. Pattern: _ _ _ E R.

Similarly, for L:
  - Not at position 3 (from roles) and not at position 1 (from lured). So L must be at position 2? Because positions 1 and 3 are ruled out? And position 4 is E? Position 5 is R? So L must be at position 2? The only possibility left? But we have positions 1,2,3,4,5? Position 4 is E, position 5 is R? So L can be at position 2? Or what about position 3? But position 3 was ruled out only by Guess 2? But if L is at 3? Then in Guess 2 we put L at 3 and got '-', meaning L is present but not at position 3? That constraint applies to the secret word? So L cannot be at 3? Therefore, L must be at position 2? Because positions 1 and 3 are forbidden? And positions 4 and 5 are taken? So only position 2 is left? 

Therefore, L must be at position 2? So the pattern is: _ L _ E R.

The secret word has:
  Position 1: unknown (but not absent letters, and not R, E, L? because we assume distinct)
  Position 2: L
  Position 3: unknown
  Position 4: E
  Position 5: R

We know the letter at position 1 and position 3 must be from the remaining letters? And not absent? So not C,A,N,O,S,U,D? Also, they must be letters that form a valid word.

The word pattern: ? L ? E R

We need to fill positions 1 and 3 with two letters that are not in the absent list? And form a word.

Possible words? For example:
  ""BLUER"" -> but U is absent? and D? No, U is absent? So skip? BLUER has U? But U is absent? So we cannot use U? And BLUER has U? So invalid.
  ""FLIER"" -> F, L, I, E, R -> positions: F at 1, L at 2, I at 3, E at 4, R at 5? So it fits the pattern? And letters: F,L,I,E,R? F and I are not absent? So possible.
  ""PLIER"" -> P,L,I,E,R -> same.
  ""GLIER"" -> G,L,I,E,R? Is that a word? Meaning to squint? Probably archaic? But let's accept.
  ""ALI?R"" but A is absent? 
  ""H?"" for position 1? For example: ""HLI?R""? Not English? 

Common words: 
  ""FLIER"": a bird or something that flies? Valid.
  ""PLIER"": a tool? Valid.

Also, ""TRIER"" -> but T at 1, R at 3? But R cannot be at 3? Because we have position 3 as unknown? But in this case, R would be at 3? But we know R is at position 5? So we cannot have two R? Because we assumed distinct? And the feedback doesn't suggest duplicates? So we should avoid? Unless we see evidence of duplicate letters? But we haven't? So for now, assume distinct? Then ""TRIER"" would have two R? so invalid? Because the first R would be at position 3? and second at 5? But the secret word has only one R? Actually, feedback didn't say anything about duplicates? But we haven't encountered duplicate? 

But to avoid confusion, let's stick to distinct letters? And since we haven't seen any duplicate during feedback? We assume no duplicate? So in ""TRIER"", there would be two R? which violates? So skip.

Similarly, ""SKIER"" -> S is absent? Skip.

So the probable words are: ""FLIER"", ""PLIER"", ""GLIER"", and maybe others with other letters.

We now have to make a fourth guess? We can guess one of these? Since we have a fixed pattern.

But we need to include? We know L at 2? E at 4? R at 5? And position 1 and 3 to be filled? 

For the fourth guess, we can try ""flier""? or ""plier""? 

Let's choose a common one: ""flier"" and ""plier"" are common? We can choose ""plier"" because it has P? which may be less common? Or choose ""flier"" for F?

But we have to choose: let's try ""flier"".

Alternatively, we can try a word that includes more new letters? But we have to fit the pattern? However, we might also consider that the word could be ""something else"" that fits the pattern? We must choose a valid English word.

We don't have much information on the remaining letters? So we can guess a word that uses common letters for positions 1 and 3? For example, F and I? Or P and I? Etc.

To narrow down, we can try ""flier"" or just guess ""plier"". 

I will choose ""flier"" for the fourth guess.

But note: the word ""flier"" fits the pattern: F at 1, L at 2, I at 3, E at 4, R at 5? Exactly the pattern.

Similarly, ""plier"" also fits.

But we want to make a guess? We can pick one? 

Alternatively, if we guess ""flier"", we might win? Or get new information? So let's try.

Therefore, guess ""flier"".Based on the feedback from all guesses:

- **Absent Letters (x):** C, A, N, O, S, U, D  
- **Position Constraints:**  
  - **E** is **fixed at position 4** (confirmed by Guess 2 and 3).
  - **R** is present but **not at positions 1, 2, or 3** (ruled out by Guess 2 and 3). Thus, R must be at position 5.
  - **L** is present but **not at positions 1 or 3** (ruled out by Guess 2 and 3). Since positions 4–5 are taken, L must be at position 2.
- **Secret Word Pattern:** \_ L \_ E R  
- **Remaining Letters:** Must fill positions 1 and 3 with valid English letters not in the absent list (e.g., B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z).

**Deductions:**  
The secret word is a 5-letter word matching the pattern \_ L \_ E R. Common words fitting this pattern include **FLIER** (meaning ""one who flies""), **PLIER** (meaning ""a tool""), **GLIER** (archaic for ""squinting""), etc.  

**Strategy for Guess 4:**  
Test **""FLIER""** because:  
- It fits the deduced pattern (F at position 1, L at 2, I at 3, E at 4, R at 5).  
- Uses common letters (F, I) to maximize discovery of new information.  
- If incorrect, feedback (e.g., F or I marked ""x"" or ""-"") will reveal the missing letters and narrow options further.

Similarly, E can be at any position except 5.\n\n However, we must also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But the rules don\'t specify, so we assume no duplicates unless feedback suggests otherwise. But in this feedback, we don\'t have any duplicates.\n\n Now, for the second guess, we want to try to place R and E in new positions and also test new letters.\n\n We know the word has R and E. Let\'s try to think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N.\n\n Also, we want to cover more common letters. Common consonants besides R: T, L, S, etc. Common vowels: we have E, and we know A is absent, so other vowels: O, I, U? But we have E already.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word:\n\n We know:\n   Position 1: cannot be C (absent) and we don\'t know about others. But we can try to put R at position 1? Or E? Or a new letter.\n\n Since R is in the word and not at position 2, let\'s try putting R at position 1. And E is not at position 5, so let\'s put E at position 4? Or 3? We have to choose.\n\n Also, we need to avoid positions that we know are wrong for R and E? Actually, we only know that R is not at 2 and E is not at 5. So:\n\n   For R: allowed positions: 1, 3, 4, 5.\n   For E: allowed positions: 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\n We can try to put R at position 1 and E at position 3? Or position 4? \n\n Let\'s think of words that start with R and have E in the middle.\n\n Example: ""REBEL"" -> but that has E at position 2 and 4? And we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have to avoid A and C and N.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters. The rules don\'t forbid it, but we haven\'t seen any feedback suggesting duplicates. So we should avoid assuming duplicates until necessary.\n\n Alternatively, let\'s try a word that has R at position 1 and E at position 4? \n\n Example: ""ROUTE"" -> but we don\'t know if O and U and T are in the word? Also, we have E at position 5? But wait, in ""ROUTE"", E is at position 5, which we know is not allowed for E (because in the first guess E was at position 5 and got a \'-\', meaning E is in the word but not at position 5). So we cannot put E at position 5.\n\n So we need E at positions 1,2,3, or 4.\n\n Let me try: ""RESTY"" -> R at 1, E at 2, S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5. But we don\'t know if S, T, Y are in the word? And we are testing new letters.\n\n However, note that in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and now we are putting R at position 1. That\'s allowed because the feedback only said R is not at position 2.\n\n Similarly, E was at position 5 and now we put it at position 2.\n\n But wait: what if the word has two R\'s? We don\'t know. But we can try.\n\n Alternatively, we can avoid putting R at position 1 and try a different position? But we have to test.\n\n Another idea: we know the word has R and E. We can try to put R at position 3 and E at position 1? For example: ""PERKY"" -> P, E, R, K, Y.\n\n But we don\'t know if P, K, Y are in the word? And we are avoiding C, A, N.\n\n However, we have to test new letters.\n\n Let me list some words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N:\n\n   - R at position 1: \n        R E _ _ _ -> e.g., ""RESET"" (but duplicate E? and we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed) -> but we don\'t want to assume duplicates. Also, we have to avoid A and C and N.\n        ""REBUS"" -> R E B U S -> but E is at position 2? and we don\'t know about B, U, S.\n\n   - R at position 3:\n        _ _ R E _ -> e.g., ""BORED"" -> but O is new? and D is new. Also, E is at position 4? which is allowed.\n\n   - R at position 4:\n        _ _ _ R E -> but E is at position 5? which is not allowed. So we cannot put E at 5. So if we put R at 4, then E must be at 1,2,3? but then we have two positions to fill? \n\n        Example: _ _ _ R _ and then put E at 1: ""E _ _ R _"", e.g., ""EVERY"" -> but duplicate E? and we don\'t know.\n\n   - R at position 5: \n        _ _ _ _ R, and E at one of 1,2,3,4. Example: ""LATER"" -> but L, T, E, R -> but E is at position 4? and R at 5. But we have to avoid A? ""LATER"" has A which is absent! So we cannot use A.\n\n        Without A: ""TIGER"" -> T I G E R -> E at position 4? and R at 5. But we don\'t know about T, I, G.\n\n Considering the above, let\'s try to choose a word that:\n\n   - Contains R and E (since we know they are in the word).\n   - Avoids C, A, N (absent letters).\n   - Puts R in a new position (not position 2) and E in a new position (not position 5).\n   - Uses common letters to maximize information.\n\n One candidate: ""ROGUE"" -> R at 1, O, G, U, E at 5? -> but E at 5 is not allowed. So skip.\n\n Another: ""RIPER"" -> duplicate R? and we don\'t know. Also, E at position 5? not allowed.\n\n How about ""ROBES""? -> R at 1, O, B, E at 4, S at 5. \n   E is at position 4 (allowed) and R at 1 (allowed). \n   Letters: R, O, B, E, S. We avoid C, A, N.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if O, B, S are in the word? This is a good test.\n\n Alternatively, ""RESTY"": R at 1, E at 2, S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5. \n   E is at position 2 (allowed) and R at 1 (allowed). \n   We test S, T, Y.\n\n Another common word: ""TRIED"" -> T, R, I, E, D. \n   R is at position 2? But wait, we know R is in the word but not at position 2. So we cannot put R at position 2 again? \n   Actually, we can put R at position 2? But the feedback told us that in the first guess R was at position 2 and that was wrong. So in the secret word, R is not at position 2. Therefore, in our new guess, if we put R at position 2, then we know it will be marked as \'-\' again? Because the secret word does not have R at position 2. But we already know that. So it\'s a waste of a position? \n\n   We want to test R in a new position to see if we can get a \'✓\'. So it\'s better to put R in a position we haven\'t tried and that is allowed (1,3,4,5). Similarly for E.\n\n In ""TRIED"", R is at position 2? That would be the same as the first guess? And we know it\'s not at 2. So we avoid that.\n\n How about ""DRIVE""? -> D, R, I, V, E. \n   R is at position 2? Again, same problem.\n\n We need to avoid position 2 for R.\n\n Let me try: ""PRICE"" -> but C is absent? We cannot use C.\n\n Without C: ""PRIDE"" -> P, R, I, D, E. \n   R is at position 2? Again, position 2 for R is not allowed? We know R is not at position 2 in the secret word. So if we put R at position 2, we will get a \'-\' again. But we are trying to find the correct position. So we should avoid position 2 for R.\n\n How about ""PERIL""? -> P, E, R, I, L. \n   R is at position 3 (which is allowed) and E at position 2 (which is allowed for E? yes, because E was only forbidden at position 5). \n   Letters: P, E, R, I, L. We avoid C, A, N.\n\n This seems good.\n\n Another candidate: ""BERYL"" -> B, E, R, Y, L. \n   E at position 2, R at position 3. \n   But we don\'t know about B, Y, L.\n\n However, note: we have already used E at position 2? But that\'s okay because we are testing.\n\n But wait: in the first guess, we had E at position 5 and got a \'-\'. Now we are putting E at position 2. If the secret word has E at position 2, we\'ll get a \'✓\'. If not, we\'ll get a \'-\'. Similarly for R at position 3.\n\n I think ""PERIL"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and tests new positions.\n\n Alternatively, ""ROUSE"": R at 1, O, U, S, E at 5? -> E at 5 is not allowed.\n\n How about ""ROLES"": R at 1, O, L, E at 4, S at 5? \n   E is at position 4? That\'s allowed. \n   So: R(1), O(2), L(3), E(4), S(5). \n\n This is also a candidate.\n\n But note: we have to avoid using the same letter in the same position if we know it\'s wrong? We don\'t have any other constraints.\n\n Let me compare:\n\n   ""PERIL"": tests positions: \n        P at 1 (new)\n        E at 2 (new for E, since E was at 5 before)\n        R at 3 (new for R, since R was at 2 before)\n        I at 4 (new)\n        L at 5 (new)\n\n   ""ROLES"": \n        R at 1 (new for R)\n        O at 2 (new)\n        L at 3 (new)\n        E at 4 (new for E, since E was at 5 before)\n        S at 5 (new)\n\n Both are valid. But we want to cover more common consonants. The letters in ""PERIL"": P, E, R, I, L. Common letters: E, R, L, I, P.\n The letters in ""ROLES"": R, O, L, E, S. Common letters: R, O, L, E, S.\n\n Since S and O are very common, maybe ""ROLES"" is better? But we also have L and E in both.\n\n However, we already know R and E are in the word, so we are confirming their positions. The other letters (O, L, S) are common and we haven\'t tested them.\n\n I think ""ROLES"" is a good choice.\n\n But wait: what if the secret word has E at position 4? Then we get a \'✓\' for E. Similarly, if R is at position 1, we get a \'✓\'. \n\n Alternatively, we might get \'-\' for R and E if they are in the word but not at these positions.\n\n Let\'s go with ""ROLES"".\n\n However, note: we are not forced to use R and E? Actually, we must use them because we know they are in the word? But the rules don\'t require that we use known letters? But if we don\'t use them, we won\'t get information about their positions. So it\'s better to use them.\n\n So I decide: ""ROLES""\n\n But let me check: is ""ROLES"" a valid word? Yes.\n\n Therefore, second guess: ""ROLES""\n\n<guess>roles</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, A, and N are **absent** (marked ""x"").\n- R is **present** but not in position 2 (marked ""-"").\n- E is **present** but not in position 5 (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Must include **R** and **E** (since they are in the secret word).\n- Avoid C, A, and N.\n- Place R in a new position (not 2): options are 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n- Place E in a new position (not 5): options are 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n- Test new common letters (like S, O, L) to gather more information.\n\nChose **""ROLES""** because:\n- R is at position 1 (new position for R).\n- E is at position 4 (new position for E).\n- Tests new letters: O, L, S (common consonants).\n- Avoids C, A, N.\n\n<guess>roles</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: roles -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) L(-) E(✓) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\n  Meaning:\n    - C, A, N are absent.\n    - R is present (but not in position 2).\n    - E is present (but not in position 5).\n\nGuess 2: roles -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) L(-) E(✓) S(x)\n  Meaning:\n    - R is present but not in position 1 (because we put R at position 1 and got ""-"" meaning wrong position).\n    - O is absent (since ""x"").\n    - L is present but not in position 3 (because we put L at position 3 and got ""-"").\n    - E is in the word and in the correct position (position 4) because ""✓"".\n    - S is absent (since ""x"").\n\nSo from both guesses, we now know:\n\nAbsent letters: C, A, N, O, S\nPresent letters: R, E, L\n  - E is fixed at position 4 (since we have E(✓) at position 4 in ""roles"").\n\nAlso, from Guess 1: E is present but not at position 5 -> but now we know E is at position 4, so that\'s consistent.\n\nPositions we know:\n  - E must be at position 4: so the word is _ _ _ E _\n\nConstraints on R:\n  - From Guess 1: R is not at position 2.\n  - From Guess 2: R is not at position 1.\n\nSo R must be at position 3 or 5? (since position 2 and 1 are ruled out). The positions are 1,2,3,4,5. But position 4 is E, so R cannot be at position 4. Therefore, R must be at position 3 or 5.\n\nSimilarly, L is present but not at position 3 (from Guess 2). So L must be at position 1, 2, or 5? But note: if R is at position 5, then L can be at 1 or 2? Or vice versa.\n\nWe also have the present letters: R, E, L. And we know E is at 4.\n\nNow, the word has 5 letters, so there are two more letters we don\'t know? But we only know 3 present letters? Actually, the word must have two more letters that we haven\'t discovered because the absent letters are C,A,N,O,S.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if there are duplicates? We haven\'t encountered any duplicate feedback so far. The feedback for each letter is independent, and we haven\'t seen a letter appear twice in feedback? Actually, we only have one instance of R and one of E and one of L. So probably no duplicates.\n\nSo the secret word has 5 distinct letters: three we know (R, E, L) and two more that are not among the absent letters (C,A,N,O,S). \n\nThe English alphabet has 26 letters. The absent letters are C,A,N,O,S. So the remaining possible letters are: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,M,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nWe also know R is at position 3 or 5, and L is at position 1,2, or 5? But note: if R is at position 5, then position 5 is taken by R, so L cannot be at 5. Similarly, if R is at position 3, then L can be at 1,2,5? But position 5 is available.\n\nSo let\'s break it down.\n\nCase 1: R at position 3, then L must be at 1,2, or 5? But we know L is not at position 3 (from ""roles"" feedback), which is already taken by R? But in this case, position 3 is R so L isn\'t there, which is consistent. So L can be at 1,2, or 5? However, we must assign L to one of these.\n\nCase 2: R at position 5, then L can be at position 1 or 2? Because position 5 is taken by R, and position 3 is not L (from feedback) and position 4 is E.\n\nNow, we need to form a 5-letter word that fits:\n\nThe pattern: _ _ _ E _  and we know:\n  - E at 4.\n  - R either at 3 or 5.\n  - L at one of the remaining positions: if R at 3 then L at 1,2,5? But if R is at 3, then position 3 is R, so L must be at 1,2, or 5. But if we put L at 5, then position 5 is L? Then R would be at 3? That\'s fine.\n\nAlternatively, if R is at 5, then position 5 is R, and L must be at 1 or 2.\n\nSo possible scenarios:\n\nScenario A: R at position 3, L at position 1: pattern: L _ R E _\nScenario B: R at position 3, L at position 2: pattern: _ L R E _\nScenario C: R at position 3, L at position 5: pattern: _ _ R E L\nScenario D: R at position 5, L at position 1: pattern: L _ _ E R\nScenario E: R at position 5, L at position 2: pattern: _ L _ E R\n\nNow, we need to fill in the other positions with letters that are not absent (so not C, A, N, O, S) and not R,E,L (since we assume no duplicates?).\n\nWe should choose a word that tests as many of these possibilities as possible? But we have to pick one word.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to find a word that fits one of these patterns and uses common letters.\n\nLet\'s try to form words for each pattern:\n\nPattern A: L _ R E _\n  We need a letter for position 2 and position 5.\n  Example: LIBRE? but I and B? But we don\'t know if I or B is in the word? But LIBRE is a word? Yes, meaning free.\n\nPattern B: _ L R E _\n  Example: BLARE? But B,L,A,R,E -> but A is absent? so invalid. \n  Another: FLARE? F,L,A,R,E -> A absent? Also invalid.\n  Without A: GLARE? G,L,A,R,E -> A absent? Same.\n  FLIER? FLIER is F,L,I,E,R -> positions: F at 1, L at 2, I at 3? But we need R at 3? But here I is at 3 and R at 5? That doesn\'t match because pattern must have R at 3: so pattern B: first letter unknown, then L at 2, R at 3, E at 4, then last letter.\n  So: positions: 1: ?, 2: L, 3: R, 4: E, 5: ?\n  Example words: \n      ULREE? not a word.\n      PLIER? P,L,I,E,R -> but that would be P at 1, L at 2, I at 3? But we require R at 3? So if we have L at 2 and R at 3, then word must be ?LRE?\n      PLRE? not 5 letters.\n      ALERT? but A is absent.\n      Let me think: ""ELVER"" -> E L V E R? But L at 2? And R at 5? And we have two E\'s? Not matching pattern B? \n      Another: ""BLUER"" -> B L U E R -> but that has U at 3? Not R at 3? \n      Actually, ""R"" is required at position 3? So ?LRE? \n      Words: \n        ""FLIER"" doesn\'t work because it has I at 3, not R.\n        ""PLIER"" has I at 3? Not R.\n        ""ALERT"" has A (absent) and E at position 2? Not L at 2? \n      I can\'t find a common word for pattern B? \n\nPattern C: _ _ R E L\n  Example: ""MOREL"" -> but M,O,R,E,L -> O is absent? So invalid.\n          ""BAREL"" -> B,A,R,E,L -> A absent? invalid.\n          ""QUREL"" -> not a word.\n          ""TAREL"" -> T,A,R,E,L -> A absent? invalid.\n          ""FIREL"" -> F,I,R,E,L -> which is F at 1, I at 2, R at 3, E at 4, L at 5. That matches? And letters: F,I,R,E,L. Absent letters? F and I are not absent? So ""FIREL"" is not a word? \n          ""Beryl"" is B,E,R,Y,L -> but that has E at position 2? Not position 4? And we have E fixed at position 4.\n\n      For pattern C: positions 1 and 2 unknown, then R at 3, E at 4, L at 5. So ? ? R E L.\n      Words: \n          ""CAREL"" -> C is absent? invalid.\n          ""MIRREL"" -> not 5 letters.\n          ""SOREL"" -> S,O,R,E,L -> O and S are absent? invalid.\n          ""HAREL"" -> H,A,R,E,L -> A absent? invalid.\n      I don\'t find an obvious word for pattern C? Maybe not common.\n\nPattern D: L _ _ E R\n  Example: ""LIGER"" -> L,I,G,E,R -> which is L at 1, I at 2, G at 3, E at 4, R at 5. That fits.\n  Another: ""LOWER"" -> L,O,W,E,R -> but O is absent? invalid.\n  ""LUBER"" -> not a word? \n  ""LIBER"" -> L,I,B,E,R -> that\'s a word? It exists? meaning free? Yes, LIBER.\n\nPattern E: _ L _ E R\n  Example: ""BLUER"" -> B,L,U,E,R -> but U at position 3? And R at 5? So pattern: B, L, U, E, R -> position 1: B, 2: L, 3: U, 4: E, 5: R. That\'s pattern E? Yes.\n  Another: ""PLIER""? P,L,I,E,R -> but I at 3? same.\n\nBut note: pattern D and E are similar? Pattern D has L at 1, pattern E has L at 2.\n\nSo we have:\n  Pattern A: L _ R E _ -> e.g., LIBRE? But LIBRE has L at 1, I at 2, R at 3, E at 4? And the last position? LIBRE is 5 letters? L-I-B-R-E? That’s positions: L at 1, I at 2, B at 3, R at 4? Actually, that doesn\'t fit because we require R at 3? \n\n  Correction: For pattern A: L at 1, then letter at 2, then R at 3, E at 4, then letter at 5.\n      LIBRE: L (1), I (2), B (3), R (4)? -> doesn\'t work because R is at position 4? But we need R at 3? \n      Actually, if we define the pattern: positions: 1: L, 2: ?, 3: R, 4: E, 5: ?.\n      Example: ""LIBER""? L,I,B,E,R -> that has R at position 5? Not at 3? \n      To have R at 3: ""LURE?"" -> L,U,R,E? That\'s only 4 letters? \n      ""LURED"" -> L, U, R, E, D -> positions: L at 1, U at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5. That fits? And D is not absent? \n\n  So ""LURED"" is a word? Yes.\n\n  Pattern A: L, U, R, E, D -> word ""LURED"".\n\nPattern D: L,I,G,E,R -> ""LIGER"" is a word? Yes, meaning a cross between lion and tiger? But also ""TIGER"" might be? But TIGER has T at ? T,I,G,E,R -> which is pattern E? \n\nBut we cannot use A, O, S, N, C.\n\nSo possible words we identified:\n  Pattern A: ""LURED"" -> L,U,R,E,D\n  Pattern D: ""LIBER"" -> L,I,B,E,R   [but note: R at position 5?] -> pattern: L at 1, I at 2, B at 3, E at 4, R at 5. But we have E at 4? Correct. And R at 5? And L at 1? This is pattern D: L _ _ E R -> so _ in position 2 and 3: so I and B? Then for pattern D: we have L, ?, ?, E, R -> positions: 1:L, 2:?, 3:?, 4:E, 5:R.\n\nActually, pattern D: L _ _ E R -> two letters in the middle.\n\nSimilarly, pattern E: _ L _ E R -> one letter at start and one in the middle.\n\nSo ""LIBER"" is pattern D: L at 1, I at 2, B at 3, E at 4, R at 5? Then yes? That\'s L (1), I (2), B (3), E (4), R (5). So matches pattern D.\n\nBut note: pattern D requires L at 1 and R at 5? Exactly.\n\nSimilarly, pattern A: ""LURED"" -> L at 1, U at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5? So in pattern A we have R at 3? So that is scenario A: R at 3, L at 1? Yes.\n\nBut we also have pattern E: ""BLUER"" -> B,L,U,E,R -> but U is at 3? And L at 2? So it matches pattern E? But we have R at 5? And E at 4? So _ L _ E R: B at 1, L at 2, U at 3, E at 4, R at 5? So exactly.\n\nBut now we have: \n  Scenario A: LURED (if it is valid)\n  Scenario D: LIBER, LURER (but duplicate R? we don\'t know? and LURER may not be a word? Probably not) -> LIGER?\n  Scenario E: BLUER, FLIER, PLIER? But FLIER and PLIER have I at 3? And they end with R? PLIER has P, L, I, E, R? Yes? That\'s pattern E: P at 1, L at 2, I at 3, E at 4, R at 5.\n\nNow, with the feedback we don\'t have duplicates? So we can assume no duplicates? \n\nWe need to choose a third guess that helps us differentiate the scenarios.\n\nBut note: we know E is at 4? And R is at 3 or 5? And L is at 1, 2, or 5? But depending on R.\n\nWe can try to choose a word that covers some of these possibilities and tests common letters.\n\nHowever, we know from the present letters: R, E, L and E fixed at 4. And we need to find two more letters? \n\nWe can try to pick a word that includes L and R? And E? And tests positions? But we have to choose one.\n\nBut note: we also have constraints:\n\n  - R cannot be at position 1 or 2 (from past feedback). \n  - L cannot be at position 3 (from Guess 2).\n\nAnd we know E is at 4.\n\nSo let\'s try to find a word that fits the pattern that might be the solution? Or one that gives us more information.\n\nBut we don\'t have enough constraints to pin down the word? We have five possible patterns? \n\nAlternatively, we might guess a word that tests one of the possibilities? For example, if we guess ""LURED"", that would tell us if the pattern A is correct.\n\nBut maybe we should choose a word that doesn\'t depend on the unknown letters? But we have to.\n\nThe known present letters are R, E, L? And two more are unknown? So if we guess a word that includes R, E, L and two new letters that we don\'t know? We can test them.\n\nBut we should avoid absent letters: C, A, N, O, S.\n\nSo let me propose a word that tests the position of R, L and includes E at 4? And two new letters.\n\nSince E must be at 4, we can try to fix that.\n\nThe word must be * * E * ? With E at position 4.\n\nAnd it must contain R and L? And avoid absent letters.\n\nSo structure: position 4: E, and positions 1,2,3,5: to be filled? With two of them being R and L? And the other two new letters? But we don\'t have to assign both R and L? Actually, we must because they are in the word.\n\nWe also know:\n  R cannot be at 1 or 2? -> so R must be at 3 or 5? because position 1 and 2 are forbidden for R? And position 4 is E.\n\n  Similarly, L cannot be at 3? -> so L must be at 1, 2, or 5? but if R is at 5, then L can be at 1 or 2? and if R is at 3, then L at 1,2,5? \n\nSo we can consider:\n\nOption 1: Put R at position 3? \n  Then word: _ _ R E _ ? And L must be at 1, 2, or 5? But we also need two more letters? \n  Let’s pick common letters? For positions 1 and 2: we can pick common consonants or vowels? For position 5: one letter.\n\n  We need to choose a word that has L at either 1, 2, or 5 and R at 3.\n\n  Example: word with L at 1: pattern L _ R E ? \n      L? R E ? -> letters: L at 1, R at 3, E at 4, and positions 2 and 5: two new letters.\n      Example: ""LURED"" (as before): L,U,R,E,D -> but U and D? \n      Or ""LIBER"" wouldn\'t work because R is at 4? Or ""LIBER"" has R at 5, not at 3? \n\n  Actually, ""LIBER"" has R at 5? Can we find a word like L? R E ?? \n      ""LAREE"" -> A absent? invalid.\n      ""LIRE?"" not 5 letters.\n      ""LURED"" is one.\n\nOption 2: Put R at position 5?\n  Then word: _ _ _ E R? And L must be at 1 or 2? Because it cannot be at 3? And 4 is E, and 5 is R? So L must be at 1 or 2.\n\n  Example: \n      If L at 1: L ? ? E R -> e.g., ""LIBER"": L,I,B,E,R -> which is pattern D.\n      If L at 2: ? L ? E R -> e.g., ""BLUER"" (if not absent letters) but U is acceptable? Or ""PLIER"": P,L,I,E,R? Or ""ALERT"" with A absent? Not.\n\nBut in our case, ""BLUER"" has letter B,L,U,E,R? B and U are not absent? So okay? And ""PLIER"" has P,L,I,E,R.\n\nTo maximize new letters, I am considering trying ""LURED"". \n\nBut first, suppose we guess ""LURED"":\n  That covers:\n    L at 1? So if L is at 1? And R at 3? And E at 4? \n  The word is L,U,R,E,D.\n\nThis would be matching scenario A: R at position 3, L at position 1? \n\nIf it is the secret word, we win? But we are on the third guess.\n\nIf not, we get feedback? \n\nAlternatively, if we want to test both R positions, we can try a word that has R at 5? and L at 1? But E at 4? For example, ""LIBER"" (but we have to make sure the other letters are not absent?).\n\nBut note: we have two possible groupings:\n\nWe can split the possibilities by choosing a word that forces differentiation.\n\nOr, we can try to find a word that fits one of the scenarios and uses common letters? \n\nMaybe ""TRIBE"" but T,R,I,B,E -> and T,R,I,B,E at: T at 1, R at 2? But R cannot be at 2? so we must avoid.\n\nAnother idea: we know E is at 4? Let\'s choose a word that puts L and R in permitted positions and tests new common letters? For example, include T.\n\nWhat is common? Let\'s try: Pattern: _ _ _ E R? And put L at 2? Then it becomes: ? L ? E R.\n\nAnd choose common letters: B and I? That would be ""BLIER""? B,L,I,E,R? Is that a word? Blier means more blue? Not common? ""PLIER"" is more common.\n\nOr ""S?"" but S is absent.\n\nHow about ""GLUER""? G and U? But that\'s pattern? G,L,U,E,R -> which is _ L _ E R? So L at 2, U at 3? And R at 5? E at 4? So if we guess ""GLUER""? Or ""G"" may be okay? Then the word is G,L,U,E,R.\n\nBut let me check: absent letters are C,A,O,N,S? So G, U are okay.\n\nBut I don\'t know if ""GLUER"" is common? Also, what about ""TILER""? T,I,L,E,R -> T at 1, I at 2, L at 3? But L at 3? We know L cannot be at position 3? Because in ""roles"", L was at position 3 and we got \'-\', meaning L is in the word but not at position 3? So we cannot put L at 3.\n\nSo we must avoid L at 3? In ""TILER"", L is at 3? Which is not allowed? Because feedback said L in ""roles"" at position 3 got \'-\', so it cannot be at 3 in the secret word.\n\nSimilarly, we must avoid L at 3? So any guess we make, if we put L at 3? It would be marked as \'-\', which we already know? So we should avoid wasting a position? Unless we want to confirm.\n\nBut we already know it? So it\'s redundant.\n\nSo back to our options:\n\nI will choose to guess ""LURED"" to test pattern A? because it has L at 1, R at 3, E at 4? And tests U and D? Both new letters? \n\nIf it\'s not the word, we get feedback: \n\n  If ""LURED"" is the secret we win.\n\n  Otherwise:\n  We might get:\n      L: ✓ or -? If L is at position 1? Then we get ✓? \n      U: if U is in the word? We get - or x? \n      R: we put at 3? So if R is at position 3? Then ✓? We know R is either at 3 or 5? \n      E: ✓ because position 4.\n      D: ...\n\nBut if the feedback shows:\n  If L is not at position 1? But then we get \'-\', meaning L is in the word but not at 1? \n\nSimilarly, if R is not at position 3? We get \'-\'? But we know R must be at 3 or 5? If not at 3, then it must be at 5.\n\nAnd U and D would tell us.\n\nBut we have only 6 guesses? So we can be strategic.\n\nAlternatively, we can guess a word that has E at 4? And doesn\'t commit to a particular scenario? But still tests L at 1 or 2? \n\nFor example, put L at 1? and not fix R at 3? Because R could be at 5? Then if L is at 1? We get ✓ for L? \n\nBut the word should have R at either 3 or 5? Let\'s try to guess a word that has L at 1? E at 4? And R at 5? For example, ""LIBER""?\n\nIf we guess ""LIBER"":\n\n  Pattern: L at 1, R at 5? E at 4? Then if the secret word fits pattern D? However, if the secret word is ""LURED"", then ""LIBER"" would be: \n      L: ✓ (because both at 1)\n      I: we don\'t know? \n      B: absent? \n      E: ✓ at 4.\n      R: at 5? But in ""LURED"", R is at 3? So R at 5 in ""LIBER"" may be marked as \'x\' if the secret word is ""LURED""? But no: R is in the word? And in ""LURED"", R is at 3, so in ""LIBER"", R at 5 would be present but not at 5, so \'-\', meaning the secret word has R but not at 5? That would tell us that R is not at 5? So then it must be at 3.\n\nThen we know R is at 3? And L at 1? So pattern A? Then next guess ""LURED"".\n\nBut that uses two guesses.\n\nBut if we guess ""LURED"" now, and if it\'s correct, we win in three? If not, we still have information.\n\nI think let\'s go with ""LURED"" for the third guess.\n\nSo the guessed word: ""lured""\n\nBut in uppercase? The rules say ""5-letter English word"" and previous guesses are in lowercase? So lowercase.\n\n<guess>lured</guess>\n\nLet me confirm: ""LURED"" has L at 1, U at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5? And positions: \n  L at 1 -> we don\'t know if L is at 1? \n  U at 2 -> new\n  R at 3 -> we are testing if R is at 3?\n  E at 4 -> known correct\n  D at 5 -> new\n\nThis guess will give us feedback on L\'s position (if it is at 1? or not) and R\'s position (if at 3? or not) and also tell us about U and D.\n\nIf we get:\n  L(?), U(?), R(?), E(✓), D(?)\n\nAnd compare to the known present letters? \n\nSo it\'s a good test.After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **C, A, N, O, S** are **absent** (marked ""x"").\n- **E** is **correctly placed at position 4** (marked ""✓"" in ""roles"").\n- **R** is **present** but not at position 1 or 2.\n- **L** is **present** but not at position 3.\n\nDeductions:\n- E must be at position 4 (secret word pattern: \\_ \\_ \\_ E \\_).\n- R must be at position 3 or 5 (since positions 1 and 2 are ruled out).\n- L must be at position 1, 2, or 5 (since position 3 is ruled out).\n- The secret word contains exactly 5 distinct letters (no duplicates indicated in feedback).\n- Absent letters (C, A, N, O, S) must be excluded.\n\nFor the third guess, **""LURED""** is chosen because:\n- Fits letter/position constraints: E at position 4.\n- Tests R at position 3 and L at position 1.\n- Uses new common letters (U, D) to gather additional information.\n- Optimizes potential to confirm R and L positions while adhering to rules.\n\n<guess>lured</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: roles -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) L(-) E(✓) S(x)\nGuess 3: lured -> FEEDBACK: L(-) U(x) R(-) E(✓) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\n  Absent: C, A, N\n  Present: R, E (R not at position 2, E not at position 5)\n\nGuess 2: roles -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) L(-) E(✓) S(x)\n  Absent: O, S   (so total absent: C, A, N, O, S)\n  Present: R, L (R not at position 1, L not at position 3)\n  E is correct at position 4.\n\nGuess 3: lured -> FEEDBACK: L(-) U(x) R(-) E(✓) D(x)\n  Absent: U, D   (total absent: C,A,N,O,S,U,D)\n  Present: L, R -> L is not at position 1?

We know R, E, L are in the word? And we have five letters? But three known? So we must have five distinct letters? So two more letters that are not absent.\n\nTotal absent: C, A, N, O, S, U, D. That leaves a lot: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nConstraints:\n\nFrom the feedback:\n  - R is present but not at positions 1 (from roles), 2 (from crane), and 3 (from lured). Therefore, R must be at position 5? Because positions 1,2,3 are ruled out, and 4 is E? So only position 5 remains.\n  That means R is at position 5: so the word ends with R. Pattern: _ _ _ E R.\n\nSimilarly, for L:\n  - Not at position 3 (from roles) and not at position 1 (from lured). So L must be at position 2? Because positions 1 and 3 are ruled out? And position 4 is E? Position 5 is R? So L must be at position 2? The only possibility left? But we have positions 1,2,3,4,5? Position 4 is E, position 5 is R? So L can be at position 2? Or what about position 3? But position 3 was ruled out only by Guess 2? But if L is at 3? Then in Guess 2 we put L at 3 and got \'-\', meaning L is present but not at position 3? That constraint applies to the secret word? So L cannot be at 3? Therefore, L must be at position 2? Because positions 1 and 3 are forbidden? And positions 4 and 5 are taken? So only position 2 is left? \n\nTherefore, L must be at position 2? So the pattern is: _ L _ E R.\n\nThe secret word has:\n  Position 1: unknown (but not absent letters, and not R, E, L? because we assume distinct)\n  Position 2: L\n  Position 3: unknown\n  Position 4: E\n  Position 5: R\n\nWe know the letter at position 1 and position 3 must be from the remaining letters? And not absent? So not C,A,N,O,S,U,D? Also, they must be letters that form a valid word.\n\nThe word pattern: ? L ? E R\n\nWe need to fill positions 1 and 3 with two letters that are not in the absent list? And form a word.\n\nPossible words? For example:\n  ""BLUER"" -> but U is absent? and D? No, U is absent? So skip? BLUER has U? But U is absent? So we cannot use U? And BLUER has U? So invalid.\n  ""FLIER"" -> F, L, I, E, R -> positions: F at 1, L at 2, I at 3, E at 4, R at 5? So it fits the pattern? And letters: F,L,I,E,R? F and I are not absent? So possible.\n  ""PLIER"" -> P,L,I,E,R -> same.\n  ""GLIER"" -> G,L,I,E,R? Is that a word? Meaning to squint? Probably archaic? But let\'s accept.\n  ""ALI?R"" but A is absent? \n  ""H?"" for position 1? For example: ""HLI?R""? Not English? \n\nCommon words: \n  ""FLIER"": a bird or something that flies? Valid.\n  ""PLIER"": a tool? Valid.\n\nAlso, ""TRIER"" -> but T at 1, R at 3? But R cannot be at 3? Because we have position 3 as unknown? But in this case, R would be at 3? But we know R is at position 5? So we cannot have two R? Because we assumed distinct? And the feedback doesn\'t suggest duplicates? So we should avoid? Unless we see evidence of duplicate letters? But we haven\'t? So for now, assume distinct? Then ""TRIER"" would have two R? so invalid? Because the first R would be at position 3? and second at 5? But the secret word has only one R? Actually, feedback didn\'t say anything about duplicates? But we haven\'t encountered duplicate? \n\nBut to avoid confusion, let\'s stick to distinct letters? And since we haven\'t seen any duplicate during feedback? We assume no duplicate? So in ""TRIER"", there would be two R? which violates? So skip.\n\nSimilarly, ""SKIER"" -> S is absent? Skip.\n\nSo the probable words are: ""FLIER"", ""PLIER"", ""GLIER"", and maybe others with other letters.\n\nWe now have to make a fourth guess? We can guess one of these? Since we have a fixed pattern.\n\nBut we need to include? We know L at 2? E at 4? R at 5? And position 1 and 3 to be filled? \n\nFor the fourth guess, we can try ""flier""? or ""plier""? \n\nLet\'s choose a common one: ""flier"" and ""plier"" are common? We can choose ""plier"" because it has P? which may be less common? Or choose ""flier"" for F?\n\nBut we have to choose: let\'s try ""flier"".\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that includes more new letters? But we have to fit the pattern? However, we might also consider that the word could be ""something else"" that fits the pattern? We must choose a valid English word.\n\nWe don\'t have much information on the remaining letters? So we can guess a word that uses common letters for positions 1 and 3? For example, F and I? Or P and I? Etc.\n\nTo narrow down, we can try ""flier"" or just guess ""plier"". \n\nI will choose ""flier"" for the fourth guess.\n\nBut note: the word ""flier"" fits the pattern: F at 1, L at 2, I at 3, E at 4, R at 5? Exactly the pattern.\n\nSimilarly, ""plier"" also fits.\n\nBut we want to make a guess? We can pick one? \n\nAlternatively, if we guess ""flier"", we might win? Or get new information? So let\'s try.\n\nTherefore, guess ""flier"".Based on the feedback from all guesses:\n\n- **Absent Letters (x):** C, A, N, O, S, U, D  \n- **Position Constraints:**  \n  - **E** is **fixed at position 4** (confirmed by Guess 2 and 3).\n  - **R** is present but **not at positions 1, 2, or 3** (ruled out by Guess 2 and 3). Thus, R must be at position 5.\n  - **L** is present but **not at positions 1 or 3** (ruled out by Guess 2 and 3). Since positions 4–5 are taken, L must be at position 2.\n- **Secret Word Pattern:** \\_ L \\_ E R  \n- **Remaining Letters:** Must fill positions 1 and 3 with valid English letters not in the absent list (e.g., B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z).\n\n**Deductions:**  \nThe secret word is a 5-letter word matching the pattern \\_ L \\_ E R. Common words fitting this pattern include **FLIER** (meaning ""one who flies""), **PLIER** (meaning ""a tool""), **GLIER** (archaic for ""squinting""), etc.  \n\n**Strategy for Guess 4:**  \nTest **""FLIER""** because:  \n- It fits the deduced pattern (F at position 1, L at 2, I at 3, E at 4, R at 5).  \n- Uses common letters (F, I) to maximize discovery of new information.  \n- If incorrect, feedback (e.g., F or I marked ""x"" or ""-"") will reveal the missing letters and narrow options further.\n\n<guess>flier</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: roles -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) L(-) E(✓) S(x)\nGuess 3: lured -> FEEDBACK: L(-) U(x) R(-) E(✓) D(x)\nGuess 4: flier -> FEEDBACK: F(✓) L(✓) I(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from the fourth guess ""flier"":
  F(✓) L(✓) I(x) E(✓) R(✓)

This means:
  F is correct at position 1.
  L is correct at position 2.
  I is absent (x) from the word.
  E is correct at position 4.
  R is correct at position 5.

So the secret word is: F L _ E R

We know the third letter is missing, and we know that I is absent. Also, from previous feedback, we have a list of absent letters: C, A, N, O, S, U, D, I (newly added).

The secret word is F L ? E R, and the missing letter must be a letter that is not in the absent list and not F, L, E, R (since we assume distinct letters? But we don't have evidence of duplicates, so we assume distinct).

Absent letters: C, A, N, O, S, U, D, I.

So the remaining possible letters: B, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to find a 5-letter word of the form F L ? E R, where ? is one of the remaining letters.

What are the possibilities? We can list common words:

  FLYER: F, L, Y, E, R -> Y is not absent? So possible.
  FLEER: F, L, E, E, R -> but duplicate E? And we have E at position 4? But if we put E at position 3? Then it would be F, L, E, E, R? But that has two E's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But in the feedback, we haven't seen duplicates? Also, the pattern requires the third letter to be different? Because we have E at 4? So if we put E at 3? Then we have two E's? But the feedback for E in previous guesses was only one E? So probably not? Also, ""FLEER"" is a word? But it has two E's? So if the secret word has two E's, then in previous guesses, when we had E at 5 (in crane) and E at 4 (in roles) we might have gotten feedback for both? But in ""crane"", E was at 5 and we got '-' meaning there is an E but not at 5? And in ""roles"", E was at 4 and we got '✓'? That doesn't tell us about a second E? But if there were two E's, then in ""crane"" we would have gotten one E present? But we only had one E in ""crane"", so we only got one '-' for E? Similarly, in ""roles"", we had one E and got one '✓'? So it doesn't rule out a second E? 

But in our current pattern, we have F L ? E R? If we put E at position 3? Then the word is F L E E R? That's ""fleer""? Meaning to laugh mockingly? But we have two E's? 

However, in the feedback for ""flier"", we have I at position 3 marked as absent? So if the secret word had E at position 3? Then in ""flier"", we put I at 3? Which is not E? So we would get an 'x' for I? But that doesn't tell us about E? 

But we don't know if there is an E at position 3? We only know that E is at position 4? 

But we have to consider: if the secret word has two E's? Then in the first guess ""crane"", we had one E at position 5? And we got '-' meaning there is an E but not at 5? That could be either the E at 3 or the E at 4? But we don't know? 

Similarly, in ""roles"", we had E at 4 and got '✓'? So that E at 4 is correct? 

Now, if there is an E at 3? Then in ""flier"", we put I at 3? Which is not E? So we get 'x' for I? And we don't get any feedback for E at 3? Because we didn't put an E at 3? 

So we cannot rule out that the third letter is E? 

But we have to check if ""fleer"" is a valid word? Yes? 

But also, we have other possibilities? Like ""flyer"", ""flier"" is not because I is absent? We guessed ""flier"" and I was absent? So the secret word is not ""flier"".

Other words: 
  ""FLYER"": F, L, Y, E, R -> Y is not absent? So possible.
  ""FLEER"": F, L, E, E, R -> but two E's? 
  ""FLUER"" -> but U is absent? 
  ""FLAMER"" -> too long? 
  ""FLAER"" -> not a word? 
  ""FLOWER"" -> O is absent? and 6 letters? 
  ""FLUKER"" -> U absent? 
  ""FLABBER"" -> too long? 

So the common ones are ""flyer"" and ""fleer"".

But we have to choose one? 

We can also consider: 
  ""FLTER"" -> not a word? 
  ""FLNER"" -> not? 
  ""FLBER"" -> not? 

So probably ""flyer"" or ""fleer"".

Now, we need to guess? We have two options? We can guess one? 

But note: in the feedback for the first guess ""crane"", we had E at position 5? And we got '-' meaning there is an E but not at 5? If the secret word is ""fleer"", which has E at position 3 and 4? Then in ""crane"", we only got one '-' for E? But there are two E's? How does the feedback work for duplicate letters? 

In Wordle, if there is a duplicate letter in the guess, and the secret word has one occurrence, then the feedback will show one occurrence as present or correct? And the other as absent? But if the secret word has two, then both would be marked? 

But in ""crane"", we only have one E? So we only got one '-'? That doesn't tell us about the second E? 

Similarly, in ""roles"", we have one E at position 4? And we got '✓'? That doesn't tell us about the E at 3? 

In ""flier"", we didn't have an E at position 3? So we didn't test it? 

So we don't know? 

But we can look at the feedback for ""lured"": we had E at position 4? And we got '✓'? But again, no E at position 3? 

So we have to test? 

We can guess ""flyer"" first? Because it doesn't have duplicate E? 

But if we guess ""flyer"", and if it's not, then we know it must be ""fleer""? 

We have only one guess left? Because we are on the fifth guess? 

We have made 4 guesses? So we have two more? But the game has 6 guesses? 

But we can try ""flyer"" for the fifth guess? 

If it's correct, we win? If not, then we know it's ""fleer"" for the sixth guess? 

But we might get feedback that helps? 

Alternatively, we can try to think of other words? But I think ""flyer"" and ""fleer"" are the only common ones? 

Another word: ""FLIER"" is not because I is absent? 

""FLYER"" is a common word? 

So let's guess ""flyer"". 

But note: in ""flyer"", the third letter is Y? Which is not absent? 

So we guess ""flyer"". 

If the feedback for ""flyer"" is: 
  F: ✓ (position 1)
  L: ✓ (position 2)
  Y: ? 
  E: ✓ (position 4)
  R: ✓ (position 5)

If Y is present and at position 3? Then we get ✓ for Y? And we win? 

If Y is absent? Then we get 'x' for Y? Then the word must be ""fleer""? 

But if Y is absent? Then we know the third letter is not Y? And we have to use the last guess for ""fleer""? 

But we have only one guess left after that? 

But we can do that? 

Alternatively, we can guess a word that tests the third letter? But we have to fill the pattern? 

But we don't know the third letter? 

We can guess a word that has many possible letters? But we have to have the known letters fixed? 

For example, we know F, L, E, R are fixed? So we must have F at 1, L at 2, E at 4, R at 5? And the third letter is unknown? 

So we cannot change the known positions? 

Therefore, we must guess a word of the form F L ? E R? 

So we have to choose a letter for the third position? 

We can choose ""flyer"" to test Y? 

Or ""fleer"" to test E? 

But we don't know? 

Since we have two possibilities, we can choose one? 

I think ""flyer"" is more common? So let's try that. 

Therefore, fifth guess: ""flyer""

### Analysis of Feedback and Deductions

From the feedback for **Guess 4: flier**:
- **F(✓)**: Correct at position 1.
- **L(✓)**: Correct at position 2.
- **I(x)**: Absent from the word.
- **E(✓)**: Correct at position 4.
- **R(✓)**: Correct at position 5.

**Key insights**:
1. The secret word pattern is **F L _ E R** (positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 are confirmed).
2. **I is absent**, adding to the absent list: **C, A, N, O, S, U, D, I**.
3. The missing letter (position 3) must be:
   - A valid English letter not in the absent list (possible: **B, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z**).
   - Forms a real 5-letter word with ""F L _ E R"".

**Possible words**:
- **FLYER** (common word, e.g., ""a bird or pilot"").
- **FLEER** (less common, meaning ""to laugh mockingly"", but has duplicate E; possible if the word contains two E's).
- Other options (e.g., ""FLGER"", ""FLVER"") are invalid English words.

**Strategy for Guess 5**:
- Test **""FLYER""** because:
  - It uses a common letter (**Y**) for position 3.
  - If correct, we solve the puzzle.
  - If incorrect, feedback on **Y** will confirm if it is absent (narrowing to **FLEER** for the final guess).

<guess>flyer</guess>",flyer,"We have feedback from the fourth guess ""flier"":
  F(✓) L(✓) I(x) E(✓) R(✓)

This means:
  F is correct at position 1.
  L is correct at position 2.
  I is absent (x) from the word.
  E is correct at position 4.
  R is correct at position 5.

So the secret word is: F L _ E R

We know the third letter is missing, and we know that I is absent. Also, from previous feedback, we have a list of absent letters: C, A, N, O, S, U, D, I (newly added).

The secret word is F L ? E R, and the missing letter must be a letter that is not in the absent list and not F, L, E, R (since we assume distinct letters? But we don't have evidence of duplicates, so we assume distinct).

Absent letters: C, A, N, O, S, U, D, I.

So the remaining possible letters: B, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to find a 5-letter word of the form F L ? E R, where ? is one of the remaining letters.

What are the possibilities? We can list common words:

  FLYER: F, L, Y, E, R -> Y is not absent? So possible.
  FLEER: F, L, E, E, R -> but duplicate E? And we have E at position 4? But if we put E at position 3? Then it would be F, L, E, E, R? But that has two E's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But in the feedback, we haven't seen duplicates? Also, the pattern requires the third letter to be different? Because we have E at 4? So if we put E at 3? Then we have two E's? But the feedback for E in previous guesses was only one E? So probably not? Also, ""FLEER"" is a word? But it has two E's? So if the secret word has two E's, then in previous guesses, when we had E at 5 (in crane) and E at 4 (in roles) we might have gotten feedback for both? But in ""crane"", E was at 5 and we got '-' meaning there is an E but not at 5? And in ""roles"", E was at 4 and we got '✓'? That doesn't tell us about a second E? But if there were two E's, then in ""crane"" we would have gotten one E present? But we only had one E in ""crane"", so we only got one '-' for E? Similarly, in ""roles"", we had one E and got one '✓'? So it doesn't rule out a second E? 

But in our current pattern, we have F L ? E R? If we put E at position 3? Then the word is F L E E R? That's ""fleer""? Meaning to laugh mockingly? But we have two E's? 

However, in the feedback for ""flier"", we have I at position 3 marked as absent? So if the secret word had E at position 3? Then in ""flier"", we put I at 3? Which is not E? So we would get an 'x' for I? But that doesn't tell us about E? 

But we don't know if there is an E at position 3? We only know that E is at position 4? 

But we have to consider: if the secret word has two E's? Then in the first guess ""crane"", we had one E at position 5? And we got '-' meaning there is an E but not at 5? That could be either the E at 3 or the E at 4? But we don't know? 

Similarly, in ""roles"", we had E at 4 and got '✓'? So that E at 4 is correct? 

Now, if there is an E at 3? Then in ""flier"", we put I at 3? Which is not E? So we get 'x' for I? And we don't get any feedback for E at 3? Because we didn't put an E at 3? 

So we cannot rule out that the third letter is E? 

But we have to check if ""fleer"" is a valid word? Yes? 

But also, we have other possibilities? Like ""flyer"", ""flier"" is not because I is absent? We guessed ""flier"" and I was absent? So the secret word is not ""flier"".

Other words: 
  ""FLYER"": F, L, Y, E, R -> Y is not absent? So possible.
  ""FLEER"": F, L, E, E, R -> but two E's? 
  ""FLUER"" -> but U is absent? 
  ""FLAMER"" -> too long? 
  ""FLAER"" -> not a word? 
  ""FLOWER"" -> O is absent? and 6 letters? 
  ""FLUKER"" -> U absent? 
  ""FLABBER"" -> too long? 

So the common ones are ""flyer"" and ""fleer"".

But we have to choose one? 

We can also consider: 
  ""FLTER"" -> not a word? 
  ""FLNER"" -> not? 
  ""FLBER"" -> not? 

So probably ""flyer"" or ""fleer"".

Now, we need to guess? We have two options? We can guess one? 

But note: in the feedback for the first guess ""crane"", we had E at position 5? And we got '-' meaning there is an E but not at 5? If the secret word is ""fleer"", which has E at position 3 and 4? Then in ""crane"", we only got one '-' for E? But there are two E's? How does the feedback work for duplicate letters? 

In Wordle, if there is a duplicate letter in the guess, and the secret word has one occurrence, then the feedback will show one occurrence as present or correct? And the other as absent? But if the secret word has two, then both would be marked? 

But in ""crane"", we only have one E? So we only got one '-'? That doesn't tell us about the second E? 

Similarly, in ""roles"", we have one E at position 4? And we got '✓'? That doesn't tell us about the E at 3? 

In ""flier"", we didn't have an E at position 3? So we didn't test it? 

So we don't know? 

But we can look at the feedback for ""lured"": we had E at position 4? And we got '✓'? But again, no E at position 3? 

So we have to test? 

We can guess ""flyer"" first? Because it doesn't have duplicate E? 

But if we guess ""flyer"", and if it's not, then we know it must be ""fleer""? 

We have only one guess left? Because we are on the fifth guess? 

We have made 4 guesses? So we have two more? But the game has 6 guesses? 

But we can try ""flyer"" for the fifth guess? 

If it's correct, we win? If not, then we know it's ""fleer"" for the sixth guess? 

But we might get feedback that helps? 

Alternatively, we can try to think of other words? But I think ""flyer"" and ""fleer"" are the only common ones? 

Another word: ""FLIER"" is not because I is absent? 

""FLYER"" is a common word? 

So let's guess ""flyer"". 

But note: in ""flyer"", the third letter is Y? Which is not absent? 

So we guess ""flyer"". 

If the feedback for ""flyer"" is: 
  F: ✓ (position 1)
  L: ✓ (position 2)
  Y: ? 
  E: ✓ (position 4)
  R: ✓ (position 5)

If Y is present and at position 3? Then we get ✓ for Y? And we win? 

If Y is absent? Then we get 'x' for Y? Then the word must be ""fleer""? 

But if Y is absent? Then we know the third letter is not Y? And we have to use the last guess for ""fleer""? 

But we have only one guess left after that? 

But we can do that? 

Alternatively, we can guess a word that tests the third letter? But we have to fill the pattern? 

But we don't know the third letter? 

We can guess a word that has many possible letters? But we have to have the known letters fixed? 

For example, we know F, L, E, R are fixed? So we must have F at 1, L at 2, E at 4, R at 5? And the third letter is unknown? 

So we cannot change the known positions? 

Therefore, we must guess a word of the form F L ? E R? 

So we have to choose a letter for the third position? 

We can choose ""flyer"" to test Y? 

Or ""fleer"" to test E? 

But we don't know? 

Since we have two possibilities, we can choose one? 

I think ""flyer"" is more common? So let's try that. 

Therefore, fifth guess: ""flyer"" 

<guess>flyer</guess>### Analysis of Feedback and Deductions

From the feedback for **Guess 4: flier**:
- **F(✓)**: Correct at position 1.
- **L(✓)**: Correct at position 2.
- **I(x)**: Absent from the word.
- **E(✓)**: Correct at position 4.
- **R(✓)**: Correct at position 5.

**Key insights**:
1. The secret word pattern is **F L _ E R** (positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 are confirmed).
2. **I is absent**, adding to the absent list: **C, A, N, O, S, U, D, I**.
3. The missing letter (position 3) must be:
   - A valid English letter not in the absent list (possible: **B, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z**).
   - Forms a real 5-letter word with ""F L _ E R"".

**Possible words**:
- **FLYER** (common word, e.g., ""a bird or pilot"").
- **FLEER** (less common, meaning ""to laugh mockingly"", but has duplicate E; possible if the word contains two E's).
- Other options (e.g., ""FLGER"", ""FLVER"") are invalid English words.

**Strategy for Guess 5**:
- Test **""FLYER""** because:
  - It uses a common letter (**Y**) for position 3.
  - If correct, we solve the puzzle.
  - If incorrect, feedback on **Y** will confirm if it is absent (narrowing to **FLEER** for the final guess).",Guess 5: flyer -> FEEDBACK: F(✓) L(✓) Y(✓) E(✓) R(✓),SUCCESS
