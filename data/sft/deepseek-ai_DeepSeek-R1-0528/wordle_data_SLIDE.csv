We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the last letter of the secret word)

Therefore, the secret word ends with E and does not contain C, R, A, or N.

Since E is in the 5th position, we know the word ends with E.

We need to make a second guess. We should avoid using the letters C, R, A, N (since they are not in the word) and we know E is in the word and must be in the last position.

We also note that the word does not have any of the letters C, R, A, N. So we must choose a word that:
- Has E in the 5th position (because we know it's correct there)
- Uses other letters that are common and not in the set {C, R, A, N}

We can consider words that end with E and use other vowels and common consonants.

Possible letters to use: We have 26 letters minus C, R, A, N, and we know E is fixed at the end.

We have 4 positions to fill (positions 1 to 4) and we must avoid C, R, A, N.

We also want to test new letters to get more information.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we also know that the word must be a valid English word.

Good candidates: We can try a word that has a lot of common consonants and vowels that we haven't tested.

Let's think of words ending with E that don't contain C, R, A, N.

Examples: 
- ""SLATE"" -> but S, L, T are new, but we know A is not in the word? Wait, feedback said A is not in the word, so we cannot use A. Similarly, we cannot use C, R, N.

So we must avoid A, C, R, N.

Let's try to think of words ending in E without A, C, R, N.

Some ideas:
- ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> but O and L are new, and we avoid A, C, R, N. So this is acceptable.
- ""SPIKE"": S, P, I, K, E -> also acceptable.
- ""STYLE"": S, T, Y, L, E -> acceptable.

But we also want to cover vowels. We haven't tested O, I, U, etc.

Since we know the last letter is E, we can focus on the first four.

We might also consider that the word has E and we know it's at the end, so we can test other vowels in the first four positions.

Let me list a few words that end with E and don't have A, C, R, N:
- ""BIKE"" -> but that's 4 letters, we need 5. So 5-letter words.
- ""BIBLE"" -> has B, I, B, L, E -> but B repeats? We don't know if repetition is allowed, but the secret word might have repeated letters? However, the feedback doesn't indicate that, so we avoid repetition for now to maximize information.

Actually, the rules don't say the word can't have repeated letters, but in the example, there were no repeats. So it's possible, but for a second guess, we might avoid repeats.

Let me think of words without repeated letters and without A, C, R, N, and ending with E.

Some options:
1. ""STOLE"" -> letters: S, T, O, L, E
2. ""SPIKE"" -> S, P, I, K, E
3. ""STYLE"" -> S, T, Y, L, E
4. ""PHONE"" -> P, H, O, N, E -> but N is not allowed? Feedback said N is not in the word, so we cannot use N. So ""PHONE"" is invalid because of N.
5. ""MOUSE"" -> M, O, U, S, E -> U is a vowel we haven't tested.

We can also consider ""HOUSE"", but H, O, U, S, E.

But let's choose one that tests more common letters.

I think ""STOLE"" is a good candidate because it has S, T, O, L which are common.

Alternatively, ""SPIKE"" tests P, I, K which are also common.

But note: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to test.

Another idea: since we know E is at the end, we can try to test other common vowels in the first positions.

For example, we haven't tested I, O, U.

We can try a word that has I and O and other new consonants.

But we have to avoid A, C, R, N.

Let me try to find a word that has I and O and ends with E, without A, C, R, N.

Example: ""VOICE"" -> V, O, I, C, E -> but C is not allowed (we know C is not in the word). So invalid.

""POISE"" -> P, O, I, S, E -> this works: no A, C, R, N.

Similarly, ""NOISE"" -> but N is not allowed.

So ""POISE"" is acceptable: P, O, I, S, E.

We can also consider ""QUITE"" -> Q, U, I, T, E -> but Q is less common, and we might not want to use it.

Another one: ""MOIST"" -> but doesn't end with E? We need E at the end.

So we must have E at the end.

Therefore, ""POISE"" is a good candidate: it tests P, O, I, S, and E (which we know is at the end).

But note: in ""POISE"", the E is at the end, so that's fixed.

Alternatively, we can try ""HOUSE"": H, O, U, S, E -> tests H, O, U, S.

I think both are good.

But let's see which one covers more common letters.

We have to consider that the secret word might have S, T, L, etc.

I think ""STOLE"" is a solid choice because it tests S, T, O, L.

We can also consider ""SLIME"": S, L, I, M, E -> tests M and I.

But let's go with ""STOLE"" for now.

However, note that in the first guess, we had E at the end, and now we are putting E at the end again, which is fine because we know it's correct.

But we are not getting new information about E, but that's okay because we are using that known position to test other letters.

So I will go with ""STOLE"".

But let me check if ""STOLE"" is a valid word: yes, it means to take something without permission.

Alternatively, we can use ""SPILE"" but that might be less common.

I think ""STOLE"" is better.

But wait, we have the letter O. We don't know if O is in the word.

Another candidate: ""SUITE"" -> S, U, I, T, E -> tests U and I.

But I think ""STOLE"" is fine.

We can also consider ""SHIRE"" but that has R? We know R is not in the word (from first feedback: R was x). So we cannot use R.

Therefore, we must avoid R.

So ""STOLE"" does not have R, so it's okay.

Similarly, ""POISE"" is also okay.

I think I'll go with ""POISE"" because it tests three vowels: O and I, and also P and S.

But ""POISE"" has O, I, and S.

Alternatively, ""HOUSE"" has O, U, and S.

But U is less common than I? Not necessarily.

We can choose either.

Let me pick ""POISE"" because it has two new vowels (O and I) and two consonants (P and S).

So second guess: ""POISE""

But note: in ""POISE"", the E is at the end, which we know is correct.

So we are testing the first four letters: P, O, I, S.

If we get feedback, we can know about these letters.

Therefore, I will guess ""POISE"".

But let me confirm: the word is ""POISE"", which is a valid English word meaning composure.

Yes.

So the guess is ""POISE"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and N are not in the secret word (all marked as ""x"").
- E is in the secret word and in the correct position (5th letter, marked as ""✓"").

Therefore, the secret word ends with ""E"" and does not contain C, R, A, or N. For the second guess:
- The word must end with ""E"" to confirm or build on the known position.
- Avoid using C, R, A, or N to focus on new letters.
- Prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, O, I, P, L) to maximize information gain.

A strong second guess is ""POISE"" because:
- It ends with ""E"", leveraging the known correct position.
- It tests new common letters: P, O, I, S.
- It avoids C, R, A, and N.
- As a valid English word, it provides broad coverage of vowels (O, I) and consonants (P, S).

This guess will help identify if any of P, O, I, or S are in the word and their positions, narrowing down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Actually, the rules don't say the word can't have repeated letters, but in the example, there were no repeats. So it's possible, but for a second guess, we might avoid repeats.

Let me think of words without repeated letters and without A, C, R, N, and ending with E.

Some options:
1. ""STOLE"" -> letters: S, T, O, L, E
2. ""SPIKE"" -> S, P, I, K, E
3. ""STYLE"" -> S, T, Y, L, E
4. ""PHONE"" -> P, H, O, N, E -> but N is not allowed? Feedback said N is not in the word, so we cannot use N. So ""PHONE"" is invalid because of N.
5. ""MOUSE"" -> M, O, U, S, E -> U is a vowel we haven't tested.

We can also consider ""HOUSE"", but H, O, U, S, E.

But let's choose one that tests more common letters.

I think ""STOLE"" is a good candidate because it has S, T, O, L which are common.

Alternatively, ""SPIKE"" tests P, I, K which are also common.

But note: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to test.

Another idea: since we know E is at the end, we can try to test other common vowels in the first positions.

For example, we haven't tested I, O, U.

We can try a word that has I and O and other new consonants.

But we have to avoid A, C, R, N.

Let me try to find a word that has I and O and ends with E, without A, C, R, N.

Example: ""VOICE"" -> V, O, I, C, E -> but C is not allowed (we know C is not in the word). So invalid.

""POISE"" -> P, O, I, S, E -> this works: no A, C, R, N.

Similarly, ""NOISE"" -> but N is not allowed.

So ""POISE"" is acceptable: P, O, I, S, E.

We can also consider ""QUITE"" -> Q, U, I, T, E -> but Q is less common, and we might not want to use it.

Another one: ""MOIST"" -> but doesn't end with E? We need E at the end.

So we must have E at the end.

Therefore, ""POISE"" is a good candidate: it tests P, O, I, S, and E (which we know is at the end).

But note: in ""POISE"", the E is at the end, so that's fixed.

Alternatively, we can try ""HOUSE"": H, O, U, S, E -> tests H, O, U, S.

I think both are good.

But let's see which one covers more common letters.

We have to consider that the secret word might have S, T, L, etc.

I think ""STOLE"" is a solid choice because it tests S, T, O, L.

We can also consider ""SLIME"": S, L, I, M, E -> tests M and I.

But let's go with ""STOLE"" for now.

However, note that in the first guess, we had E at the end, and now we are putting E at the end again, which is fine because we know it's correct.

But we are not getting new information about E, but that's okay because we are using that known position to test other letters.

So I will go with ""STOLE"".

But let me check if ""STOLE"" is a valid word: yes, it means to take something without permission.

Alternatively, we can use ""SPILE"" but that might be less common.

I think ""STOLE"" is better.

But wait, we have the letter O. We don't know if O is in the word.

Another candidate: ""SUITE"" -> S, U, I, T, E -> tests U and I.

But I think ""STOLE"" is fine.

We can also consider ""SHIRE"" but that has R? We know R is not in the word (from first feedback: R was x). So we cannot use R.

Therefore, we must avoid R.

So ""STOLE"" does not have R, so it's okay.

Similarly, ""POISE"" is also okay.

I think I'll go with ""POISE"" because it tests three vowels: O and I, and also P and S.

But ""POISE"" has O, I, and S.

Alternatively, ""HOUSE"" has O, U, and S.

But U is less common than I? Not necessarily.

We can choose either.

Let me pick ""POISE"" because it has two new vowels (O and I) and two consonants (P and S).

So second guess: ""POISE""

But note: in ""POISE"", the E is at the end, which we know is correct.

So we are testing the first four letters: P, O, I, S.

If we get feedback, we can know about these letters.

Therefore, I will guess ""POISE"".

But let me confirm: the word is ""POISE"", which is a valid English word meaning composure.

Yes.

So the guess is ""POISE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and N are not in the secret word (all marked as ""x"").
- E is in the secret word and in the correct position (5th letter, marked as ""✓"").

Therefore, the secret word ends with ""E"" and does not contain C, R, A, or N. For the second guess:
- The word must end with ""E"" to confirm or build on the known position.
- Avoid using C, R, A, or N to focus on new letters.
- Prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, O, I, P, L) to maximize information gain.

A strong second guess is ""POISE"" because:
- It ends with ""E"", leveraging the known correct position.
- It tests new common letters: P, O, I, S.
- It avoids C, R, A, and N.
- As a valid English word, it provides broad coverage of vowels (O, I) and consonants (P, S).

This guess will help identify if any of P, O, I, or S are in the word and their positions, narrowing down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

We are given:
- For ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓) → so E is in the word and in the correct position (5th), and C, R, A, N are not in the word.
- For ""poise"": P(x), O(x), I(✓), S(-), E(✓) → 
  - I(✓) means I is in the word and in the correct position, which is the 3rd letter (since ""poise"" is P-O-I-S-E).
  - S(-) means S is in the word but in the wrong position. Since our guess had S in the 4th position, the actual word has S somewhere else.
  - P(x) and O(x) mean P and O are not in the word.
  - E(✓) confirms E is still in the 5th position.

So, we know:
- The secret word has 5 letters: _ _ _ _ E
- The 3rd letter is I → so pattern: _ _ I _ E
- The word contains S, but not in the 4th position (because in ""poise"", S was in 4th and got ""-"" meaning it's present but wrong spot). So S must be in position 1, 2, or possibly 5? But position 5 is E, so S is in 1st or 2nd.
- Letters not in the word: C, R, A, N, P, O (from both guesses).
- Also, we have used: C,R,A,N,E,P,O,I,S. So avoided letters: C, R, A, N, P, O.

Now, we need to guess a word that fits:
- Must have pattern: _ _ I _ E
- Must contain S, and S must be in either position 1 or 2 (since it can't be in 3rd which is I or 4th which was wrong in guess2, or 5th which is E). So S is in 1st or 2nd.
- We know the word has I (3rd) and E (5th) and S (somewhere).

Also, we must avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, N, P, O.

Let's summarize the known:
- Position 3: I
- Position 5: E
- S is in the word, and must be in position 1 or 2.

Now, for the word: positions:
1: must be S or some other letter (but S must appear, so if not at 1, then at 2)
2: if S is not at 1, then must be at 2.

But note, S might be at position 1 and then we can have another letter at 2, or vice versa.

Let's think of possible words that have the form _ _ I _ E, contain S, and avoid C,R,A,N,P,O.

We need to choose a word that uses new letters to test, because we only know a few letters so far.

We know S, I, E are in the word, and I and E are fixed.

The missing letters are for positions 1, 2, and 4.

Position 4 is the only one without any info except it can't be S (because if S were in position 4, guess2 would have shown it as correct? But in guess2, S was in position 4 and got ""-"", meaning it's not fixed there).

So we are free to choose letters for positions 1, 2, 4, with constraints:
- The word must have S in position 1 or 2.
- The remaining positions (1 or 2 and 4) can be any other letters from the alphabet except C, R, A, N, P, O.
- And the word must be valid English.

We also have only 4 tries left (since we are on guess 3).

Let's list some possible words that fit: _ _ I _ E

And contain S.

Case 1: S at position 1 → words starting with ""SI?E"" → S X I Y E, where X and Y are letters not in the bad set.

Case 2: S at position 2 → words like X S I Y E.

Then, we must avoid C,R,A,N,P,O.

We also haven't tested many letters: for example, we have used C,R,A,N,E,P,O,I,S. So available: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

But we must form a valid word.

Let's brainstorm examples:

Case 1: S at position 1 → ""S""? I _ E
Examples:
- ""SMILE"" → S M I L E → positions: S(1), M(2), I(3), L(4), E(5). But L is new and M is new. And avoids bad letters.
- ""SHINE"" → S H I N E → but N is bad? We know N is not in the word (from first guess: N(x)). And also, in ""SHINE"", N is at position 4, but N is forbidden. So invalid.
- ""SKITE""? Not common.
- ""SPITE"" → but P is bad? P was used and got x, so P not in word → invalid.
So ""SMILE"" is a candidate.

Case 2: S at position 2 → _ S I _ E
Examples:
- ""USILE"" not valid.
- ""ASIDE"" → but A is bad → invalid.
- ""FSIZE"" not word.
- ""MSIZE"" not word.
- ""TWISE"" not common.
- ""SWIPE"" → S W I P E → but P is bad → invalid.
- ""SUITE"" → S U I T E → but here S is at position 2? Wait: positions: 1:? Let me see: if S at position 2, then it's X S I Y E.

For ""SUITE"": would be U S I T E? But ""suite"" is S-U-I-T-E? Oh, no, ""suite"" starts with S. Wait, if S is at position 2, then the word must be like X S I Y E.

""AXIS"" ends with S? We need E at the end.

Possible words: 
- ""ELSIE""? But that's E at start → word ""ELSIE"" is E-L-S-I-E → positions: E(1), L(2), S(3), I(4), E(5). But wait, we need I at position 3 and E at 5? Here E is at 1 and 5, I at 4? Not matching pattern.

Actually, we have pattern: position 3 must be I, 5 must be E.

So for S at pos2: _ S I _ E

Examples:
- ""USINE"" not valid.
- ""TOWIE"" not word? 
- ""BASIE?"" B A S I E → but A is bad → invalid.

Another word: ""SHIRE"" → S H I R E → but R is bad → invalid.

""WHITE"" → W H I T E → but does not have S? We must have S in the word → ""WHITE"" has no S.

We need the word to contain S.

So for position 2 being S: words like X S I Y E.

Valid English words: 
- ""ASSIE"" not proper.
- ""ESSIE""? Not common.
- ""dassie"" → D A S S I E → too long? But 5 letter: DASSIE is 6? 

Actually, 5-letter examples I can think of: 
- ""TSINE"" not common.
- ""PSION"" doesn't end with E.

Perhaps ""TASTE"" → T A S T E → but A is bad and pattern: position 3? We need I at pos3? ""TASTE"" has S at pos3? Not matching.

Wait, we must have I at position 3 → so the word must be: letter1, letter2, I, letter4, E.

And letter2 must be S? So: ? S I ? E

Known words: 
- ""USIAE"" not word.
- ""MASTI"" ends with I? No.

How about ""POSIE""? But O and P are bad? Wait, we have ""poise"" already.

Another one: ""DEVIE""? Not valid.

Perhaps I cannot find any word where S is at position 2? Maybe it's not common.

In English, common words ending with ""IE"" have S at the beginning? Let me think.

With pattern: _ _ I _ E, and S in the word at 1 or 2.

If S is at 2: then the form is ? S I ? E

Examples of valid words:
- ""ASSISI"" too long.
- ""CIVIE"" doesn't have S.
- ""COSIE"" O is bad.

Perhaps ""BUSBY"" doesn't end with E.

It might be that S at position 2 is rare. 

So possibly S is at position 1.

Therefore, let's focus on S at position 1: S ? I ? E

Examples:
- ""SMILE"": S M I L E
- ""SLITE"" (not common) → S L I T E
- ""SAICE"" but A is bad → invalid.
- ""SUITE"": S U I T E → but then the pattern: S U I T E → but we have I at position 3 and E at position 5, good. And S at position 1.

""SUITE"" is S, U, I, T, E → which has U and T.

But in ""poise"", we had S at position 4 and got ""-"", meaning S is in the word but not at 4. In ""SUITE"", S is at 1, so that's okay.

But note: in ""SUITE"", we have T at position 4. And U at position 2.

We haven't tested U or T.

So ""SUITE"" is a candidate.

Also, ""SHITE"" is vulgar and we should avoid? Not appropriate.

Also, ""SKITE"" may not be well known.

So good candidates: ""SMILE"" and ""SUITE"".

We also have: ""QUITE"" → Q U I T E, but Q is less common.

But ""SUITE"" and ""SMILE"" are good.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test more letters.

In ""SMILE"", we test M and L.
In ""SUITE"", we test U and T.

We haven't tested either set.

But note: we know position 4 in the secret word is open. We need to guess a word that will narrow down the possibilities.

If we guess ""SMILE"", we will test M in position 2 and L in position 4.

If we guess ""SUITE"", we test U in position 2 and T in position 4.

Both seem acceptable.

But note: ""poise"" had S in the 4th position and we got S(-), meaning S is not at 4. If we guess ""SUITE"", S is at 1, so if S is indeed at 1 in the secret word, we would get S(✓) if it's correct? Wait, but we don't know if S is at 1 or 2.

Actually, ""SUITE"" has S at 1, so if the secret word has S at 1, we will see S(✓) in the feedback for position 1.

Similarly, if we guess ""SMILE"" and S is at 1, we get S(✓).

But note, regardless, we are testing S at position 1 explicitly.

If we get S(✓), then we know S is at position 1.

If we get S(-), that would mean S is in the word but not at 1? But that cannot be because if S is not at 1, then it must be at 2 (since positions 3,4,5 are either I,4th unknown, E).

But if S is at 2, and we put it at 1, then we get S(-) meaning it's in the word but wrong position, so S must be at position 2.

Therefore, by guessing a word that has S at position 1, we can determine whether S is at 1 or 2.

We need to do this because we don't know S's position.

Therefore, we should design our next guess to have S at position 1 to test position 1.

Because in the wild, S could be in 1 or 2.

So picking a word with S at position 1 will tell us:

- If S(✓), then position 1 is S.
- If S(-), then position 1 must be something else, and S must be at position 2.

Therefore, we should choose a word that has S at position 1 and other new letters.

For example: ""SUITE"" or ""SMILE"".

Both are valid.

Let us choose ""SUITE"" because it uses U and T, which are common consonants and vowels, respectively.

""SUITE"": S at 1, U at 2, I at 3, T at 4, E at 5.

We know I (3) and E (5) will be ✓, so we get info on U and T.

If ""SUITE"" is the word, we win.

Otherwise, feedback will tell us about U and T.

We might also consider ""SHINE"", but N is bad → invalid.

So ""SUITE"" seems good.

But let me confirm: in ""SUITE"", position 4 is T, which we don't know.

And we avoid bad letters: C,R,A,N,P,O.

Yes, U and T are not forbidden.

Similarly, ""SMILE"" has M and L.

But why ""SUITE"" over ""SMILE""? Not a strong reason. Both would work.

But note: position 4 in the secret word might be T or not, etc.

I think ""SUITE"" is a common word.

So I will go with ""SUITE"".

Therefore, third guess: ""SUITE""

In the response, we will return that.
</think>
Based on the feedback:
- **First guess ""crane""**: E is confirmed in the correct 5th position (✓), and C, R, A, N are absent (x).
- **Second guess ""poise""**: I is confirmed in the correct 3rd position (✓), E is confirmed again in the 5th position (✓), S is present but not in the 4th position (-), and P and O are absent (x). 

### Key deductions:
- **Pattern**: The secret word must match the pattern `_  _  I  _  E`.
- **S position**: Since S is in the word but not in position 4 (from ""poise"" feedback), and positions 3 (I) and 5 (E) are fixed, S must be in position 1 or 2.
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N (from ""crane""), P, O (from ""poise"") are not in the word. Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- **Strategy**: Focus on:
  - Testing the position of S (i.e., is it in position 1 or 2?).
  - Using new, common letters to gain more information.
  - Avoiding the known absent letters.

### Optimal next guess: ""SUITE""
- **Why ""SUITE""?**
  - **Pattern match**: SUITE → S (pos1), U (pos2), I (pos3), T (pos4), E (pos5). This fits `_ _ I _ E`, with I and E in their confirmed positions.
  - **Tests S position**: By placing S in position 1, the feedback will pinpoint S's location:
    - If S is ✓, S is in position 1.
    - If S is -, S must be in position 2 (since it cannot be in position 3, 4, or 5).
  - **U and T**: Tests new letters (U and T) that are common vowels/consonants and haven't been tried yet.
  - **Avoids absent letters**: No C, R, A, N, P, or O.
  - **Word validity**: ""SUITE"" is a valid 5-letter English word (meaning a set of rooms or a musical composition).

### Expected outcomes:
- The feedback will clarify:
  - The exact position of S.
  - Whether U and T are present and their positions.
- This narrows possibilities efficiently for the next guess.

<guess>suite</guess>",suite,"We are given:
- For ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓) → so E is in the word and in the correct position (5th), and C, R, A, N are not in the word.
- For ""poise"": P(x), O(x), I(✓), S(-), E(✓) → 
  - I(✓) means I is in the word and in the correct position, which is the 3rd letter (since ""poise"" is P-O-I-S-E).
  - S(-) means S is in the word but in the wrong position. Since our guess had S in the 4th position, the actual word has S somewhere else.
  - P(x) and O(x) mean P and O are not in the word.
  - E(✓) confirms E is still in the 5th position.

So, we know:
- The secret word has 5 letters: _ _ _ _ E
- The 3rd letter is I → so pattern: _ _ I _ E
- The word contains S, but not in the 4th position (because in ""poise"", S was in 4th and got ""-"" meaning it's present but wrong spot). So S must be in position 1, 2, or possibly 5? But position 5 is E, so S is in 1st or 2nd.
- Letters not in the word: C, R, A, N, P, O (from both guesses).
- Also, we have used: C,R,A,N,E,P,O,I,S. So avoided letters: C, R, A, N, P, O.

Now, we need to guess a word that fits:
- Must have pattern: _ _ I _ E
- Must contain S, and S must be in either position 1 or 2 (since it can't be in 3rd which is I or 4th which was wrong in guess2, or 5th which is E). So S is in 1st or 2nd.
- We know the word has I (3rd) and E (5th) and S (somewhere).

Also, we must avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, N, P, O.

Let's summarize the known:
- Position 3: I
- Position 5: E
- S is in the word, and must be in position 1 or 2.

Now, for the word: positions:
1: must be S or some other letter (but S must appear, so if not at 1, then at 2)
2: if S is not at 1, then must be at 2.

But note, S might be at position 1 and then we can have another letter at 2, or vice versa.

Let's think of possible words that have the form _ _ I _ E, contain S, and avoid C,R,A,N,P,O.

We need to choose a word that uses new letters to test, because we only know a few letters so far.

We know S, I, E are in the word, and I and E are fixed.

The missing letters are for positions 1, 2, and 4.

Position 4 is the only one without any info except it can't be S (because if S were in position 4, guess2 would have shown it as correct? But in guess2, S was in position 4 and got ""-"", meaning it's not fixed there).

So we are free to choose letters for positions 1, 2, 4, with constraints:
- The word must have S in position 1 or 2.
- The remaining positions (1 or 2 and 4) can be any other letters from the alphabet except C, R, A, N, P, O.
- And the word must be valid English.

We also have only 4 tries left (since we are on guess 3).

Let's list some possible words that fit: _ _ I _ E

And contain S.

Case 1: S at position 1 → words starting with ""SI?E"" → S X I Y E, where X and Y are letters not in the bad set.

Case 2: S at position 2 → words like X S I Y E.

Then, we must avoid C,R,A,N,P,O.

We also haven't tested many letters: for example, we have used C,R,A,N,E,P,O,I,S. So available: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

But we must form a valid word.

Let's brainstorm examples:

Case 1: S at position 1 → ""S""? I _ E
Examples:
- ""SMILE"" → S M I L E → positions: S(1), M(2), I(3), L(4), E(5). But L is new and M is new. And avoids bad letters.
- ""SHINE"" → S H I N E → but N is bad? We know N is not in the word (from first guess: N(x)). And also, in ""SHINE"", N is at position 4, but N is forbidden. So invalid.
- ""SKITE""? Not common.
- ""SPITE"" → but P is bad? P was used and got x, so P not in word → invalid.
So ""SMILE"" is a candidate.

Case 2: S at position 2 → _ S I _ E
Examples:
- ""USILE"" not valid.
- ""ASIDE"" → but A is bad → invalid.
- ""FSIZE"" not word.
- ""MSIZE"" not word.
- ""TWISE"" not common.
- ""SWIPE"" → S W I P E → but P is bad → invalid.
- ""SUITE"" → S U I T E → but here S is at position 2? Wait: positions: 1:? Let me see: if S at position 2, then it's X S I Y E.

For ""SUITE"": would be U S I T E? But ""suite"" is S-U-I-T-E? Oh, no, ""suite"" starts with S. Wait, if S is at position 2, then the word must be like X S I Y E.

""AXIS"" ends with S? We need E at the end.

Possible words: 
- ""ELSIE""? But that's E at start → word ""ELSIE"" is E-L-S-I-E → positions: E(1), L(2), S(3), I(4), E(5). But wait, we need I at position 3 and E at 5? Here E is at 1 and 5, I at 4? Not matching pattern.

Actually, we have pattern: position 3 must be I, 5 must be E.

So for S at pos2: _ S I _ E

Examples:
- ""USINE"" not valid.
- ""TOWIE"" not word? 
- ""BASIE?"" B A S I E → but A is bad → invalid.

Another word: ""SHIRE"" → S H I R E → but R is bad → invalid.

""WHITE"" → W H I T E → but does not have S? We must have S in the word → ""WHITE"" has no S.

We need the word to contain S.

So for position 2 being S: words like X S I Y E.

Valid English words: 
- ""ASSIE"" not proper.
- ""ESSIE""? Not common.
- ""dassie"" → D A S S I E → too long? But 5 letter: DASSIE is 6? 

Actually, 5-letter examples I can think of: 
- ""TSINE"" not common.
- ""PSION"" doesn't end with E.

Perhaps ""TASTE"" → T A S T E → but A is bad and pattern: position 3? We need I at pos3? ""TASTE"" has S at pos3? Not matching.

Wait, we must have I at position 3 → so the word must be: letter1, letter2, I, letter4, E.

And letter2 must be S? So: ? S I ? E

Known words: 
- ""USIAE"" not word.
- ""MASTI"" ends with I? No.

How about ""POSIE""? But O and P are bad? Wait, we have ""poise"" already.

Another one: ""DEVIE""? Not valid.

Perhaps I cannot find any word where S is at position 2? Maybe it's not common.

In English, common words ending with ""IE"" have S at the beginning? Let me think.

With pattern: _ _ I _ E, and S in the word at 1 or 2.

If S is at 2: then the form is ? S I ? E

Examples of valid words:
- ""ASSISI"" too long.
- ""CIVIE"" doesn't have S.
- ""COSIE"" O is bad.

Perhaps ""BUSBY"" doesn't end with E.

It might be that S at position 2 is rare. 

So possibly S is at position 1.

Therefore, let's focus on S at position 1: S ? I ? E

Examples:
- ""SMILE"": S M I L E
- ""SLITE"" (not common) → S L I T E
- ""SAICE"" but A is bad → invalid.
- ""SUITE"": S U I T E → but then the pattern: S U I T E → but we have I at position 3 and E at position 5, good. And S at position 1.

""SUITE"" is S, U, I, T, E → which has U and T.

But in ""poise"", we had S at position 4 and got ""-"", meaning S is in the word but not at 4. In ""SUITE"", S is at 1, so that's okay.

But note: in ""SUITE"", we have T at position 4. And U at position 2.

We haven't tested U or T.

So ""SUITE"" is a candidate.

Also, ""SHITE"" is vulgar and we should avoid? Not appropriate.

Also, ""SKITE"" may not be well known.

So good candidates: ""SMILE"" and ""SUITE"".

We also have: ""QUITE"" → Q U I T E, but Q is less common.

But ""SUITE"" and ""SMILE"" are good.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test more letters.

In ""SMILE"", we test M and L.
In ""SUITE"", we test U and T.

We haven't tested either set.

But note: we know position 4 in the secret word is open. We need to guess a word that will narrow down the possibilities.

If we guess ""SMILE"", we will test M in position 2 and L in position 4.

If we guess ""SUITE"", we test U in position 2 and T in position 4.

Both seem acceptable.

But note: ""poise"" had S in the 4th position and we got S(-), meaning S is not at 4. If we guess ""SUITE"", S is at 1, so if S is indeed at 1 in the secret word, we would get S(✓) if it's correct? Wait, but we don't know if S is at 1 or 2.

Actually, ""SUITE"" has S at 1, so if the secret word has S at 1, we will see S(✓) in the feedback for position 1.

Similarly, if we guess ""SMILE"" and S is at 1, we get S(✓).

But note, regardless, we are testing S at position 1 explicitly.

If we get S(✓), then we know S is at position 1.

If we get S(-), that would mean S is in the word but not at 1? But that cannot be because if S is not at 1, then it must be at 2 (since positions 3,4,5 are either I,4th unknown, E).

But if S is at 2, and we put it at 1, then we get S(-) meaning it's in the word but wrong position, so S must be at position 2.

Therefore, by guessing a word that has S at position 1, we can determine whether S is at 1 or 2.

We need to do this because we don't know S's position.

Therefore, we should design our next guess to have S at position 1 to test position 1.

Because in the wild, S could be in 1 or 2.

So picking a word with S at position 1 will tell us:

- If S(✓), then position 1 is S.
- If S(-), then position 1 must be something else, and S must be at position 2.

Therefore, we should choose a word that has S at position 1 and other new letters.

For example: ""SUITE"" or ""SMILE"".

Both are valid.

Let us choose ""SUITE"" because it uses U and T, which are common consonants and vowels, respectively.

""SUITE"": S at 1, U at 2, I at 3, T at 4, E at 5.

We know I (3) and E (5) will be ✓, so we get info on U and T.

If ""SUITE"" is the word, we win.

Otherwise, feedback will tell us about U and T.

We might also consider ""SHINE"", but N is bad → invalid.

So ""SUITE"" seems good.

But let me confirm: in ""SUITE"", position 4 is T, which we don't know.

And we avoid bad letters: C,R,A,N,P,O.

Yes, U and T are not forbidden.

Similarly, ""SMILE"" has M and L.

But why ""SUITE"" over ""SMILE""? Not a strong reason. Both would work.

But note: position 4 in the secret word might be T or not, etc.

I think ""SUITE"" is a common word.

So I will go with ""SUITE"".

Therefore, third guess: ""SUITE""

In the response, we will return that.Based on the feedback:
- **First guess ""crane""**: E is confirmed in the correct 5th position (✓), and C, R, A, N are absent (x).
- **Second guess ""poise""**: I is confirmed in the correct 3rd position (✓), E is confirmed again in the 5th position (✓), S is present but not in the 4th position (-), and P and O are absent (x). 

### Key deductions:
- **Pattern**: The secret word must match the pattern `_  _  I  _  E`.
- **S position**: Since S is in the word but not in position 4 (from ""poise"" feedback), and positions 3 (I) and 5 (E) are fixed, S must be in position 1 or 2.
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N (from ""crane""), P, O (from ""poise"") are not in the word. Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- **Strategy**: Focus on:
  - Testing the position of S (i.e., is it in position 1 or 2?).
  - Using new, common letters to gain more information.
  - Avoiding the known absent letters.

### Optimal next guess: ""SUITE""

  - **Pattern match**: SUITE → S (pos1), U (pos2), I (pos3), T (pos4), E (pos5). This fits `_ _ I _ E`, with I and E in their confirmed positions.

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,SLIDE,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all are distinct.

 So, our first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the last letter of the secret word)

Therefore, the secret word ends with E and does not contain C, R, A, or N.

Since E is in the 5th position, we know the word ends with E.

We need to make a second guess. We should avoid using the letters C, R, A, N (since they are not in the word) and we know E is in the word and must be in the last position.

We also note that the word does not have any of the letters C, R, A, N. So we must choose a word that:
- Has E in the 5th position (because we know it's correct there)
- Uses other letters that are common and not in the set {C, R, A, N}

We can consider words that end with E and use other vowels and common consonants.

Possible letters to use: We have 26 letters minus C, R, A, N, and we know E is fixed at the end.

We have 4 positions to fill (positions 1 to 4) and we must avoid C, R, A, N.

We also want to test new letters to get more information.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we also know that the word must be a valid English word.

Good candidates: We can try a word that has a lot of common consonants and vowels that we haven't tested.

Let's think of words ending with E that don't contain C, R, A, N.

Examples: 
- ""SLATE"" -> but S, L, T are new, but we know A is not in the word? Wait, feedback said A is not in the word, so we cannot use A. Similarly, we cannot use C, R, N.

So we must avoid A, C, R, N.

Let's try to think of words ending in E without A, C, R, N.

Some ideas:
- ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> but O and L are new, and we avoid A, C, R, N. So this is acceptable.
- ""SPIKE"": S, P, I, K, E -> also acceptable.
- ""STYLE"": S, T, Y, L, E -> acceptable.

But we also want to cover vowels. We haven't tested O, I, U, etc.

Since we know the last letter is E, we can focus on the first four.

We might also consider that the word has E and we know it's at the end, so we can test other vowels in the first four positions.

Let me list a few words that end with E and don't have A, C, R, N:
- ""BIKE"" -> but that's 4 letters, we need 5. So 5-letter words.
- ""BIBLE"" -> has B, I, B, L, E -> but B repeats? We don't know if repetition is allowed, but the secret word might have repeated letters? However, the feedback doesn't indicate that, so we avoid repetition for now to maximize information.

Actually, the rules don't say the word can't have repeated letters, but in the example, there were no repeats. So it's possible, but for a second guess, we might avoid repeats.

Let me think of words without repeated letters and without A, C, R, N, and ending with E.

Some options:
1. ""STOLE"" -> letters: S, T, O, L, E
2. ""SPIKE"" -> S, P, I, K, E
3. ""STYLE"" -> S, T, Y, L, E
4. ""PHONE"" -> P, H, O, N, E -> but N is not allowed? Feedback said N is not in the word, so we cannot use N. So ""PHONE"" is invalid because of N.
5. ""MOUSE"" -> M, O, U, S, E -> U is a vowel we haven't tested.

We can also consider ""HOUSE"", but H, O, U, S, E.

But let's choose one that tests more common letters.

I think ""STOLE"" is a good candidate because it has S, T, O, L which are common.

Alternatively, ""SPIKE"" tests P, I, K which are also common.

But note: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to test.

Another idea: since we know E is at the end, we can try to test other common vowels in the first positions.

For example, we haven't tested I, O, U.

We can try a word that has I and O and other new consonants.

But we have to avoid A, C, R, N.

Let me try to find a word that has I and O and ends with E, without A, C, R, N.

Example: ""VOICE"" -> V, O, I, C, E -> but C is not allowed (we know C is not in the word). So invalid.

""POISE"" -> P, O, I, S, E -> this works: no A, C, R, N.

Similarly, ""NOISE"" -> but N is not allowed.

So ""POISE"" is acceptable: P, O, I, S, E.

We can also consider ""QUITE"" -> Q, U, I, T, E -> but Q is less common, and we might not want to use it.

Another one: ""MOIST"" -> but doesn't end with E? We need E at the end.

So we must have E at the end.

Therefore, ""POISE"" is a good candidate: it tests P, O, I, S, and E (which we know is at the end).

But note: in ""POISE"", the E is at the end, so that's fixed.

Alternatively, we can try ""HOUSE"": H, O, U, S, E -> tests H, O, U, S.

I think both are good.

But let's see which one covers more common letters.

We have to consider that the secret word might have S, T, L, etc.

I think ""STOLE"" is a solid choice because it tests S, T, O, L.

We can also consider ""SLIME"": S, L, I, M, E -> tests M and I.

But let's go with ""STOLE"" for now.

However, note that in the first guess, we had E at the end, and now we are putting E at the end again, which is fine because we know it's correct.

But we are not getting new information about E, but that's okay because we are using that known position to test other letters.

So I will go with ""STOLE"".

But let me check if ""STOLE"" is a valid word: yes, it means to take something without permission.

Alternatively, we can use ""SPILE"" but that might be less common.

I think ""STOLE"" is better.

But wait, we have the letter O. We don't know if O is in the word.

Another candidate: ""SUITE"" -> S, U, I, T, E -> tests U and I.

But I think ""STOLE"" is fine.

We can also consider ""SHIRE"" but that has R? We know R is not in the word (from first feedback: R was x). So we cannot use R.

Therefore, we must avoid R.

So ""STOLE"" does not have R, so it's okay.

Similarly, ""POISE"" is also okay.

I think I'll go with ""POISE"" because it tests three vowels: O and I, and also P and S.

But ""POISE"" has O, I, and S.

Alternatively, ""HOUSE"" has O, U, and S.

But U is less common than I? Not necessarily.

We can choose either.

Let me pick ""POISE"" because it has two new vowels (O and I) and two consonants (P and S).

So second guess: ""POISE""

But note: in ""POISE"", the E is at the end, which we know is correct.

So we are testing the first four letters: P, O, I, S.

If we get feedback, we can know about these letters.

Therefore, I will guess ""POISE"".

But let me confirm: the word is ""POISE"", which is a valid English word meaning composure.

Yes.

So the guess is ""POISE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and N are not in the secret word (all marked as ""x"").
- E is in the secret word and in the correct position (5th letter, marked as ""✓"").

Therefore, the secret word ends with ""E"" and does not contain C, R, A, or N. For the second guess:
- The word must end with ""E"" to confirm or build on the known position.
- Avoid using C, R, A, or N to focus on new letters.
- Prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, O, I, P, L) to maximize information gain.

A strong second guess is ""POISE"" because:
- It ends with ""E"", leveraging the known correct position.
- It tests new common letters: P, O, I, S.
- It avoids C, R, A, and N.
- As a valid English word, it provides broad coverage of vowels (O, I) and consonants (P, S).

This guess will help identify if any of P, O, I, or S are in the word and their positions, narrowing down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

<guess>poise</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: poise -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(✓) S(-) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given:
- For ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓) → so E is in the word and in the correct position (5th), and C, R, A, N are not in the word.
- For ""poise"": P(x), O(x), I(✓), S(-), E(✓) → 
  - I(✓) means I is in the word and in the correct position, which is the 3rd letter (since ""poise"" is P-O-I-S-E).
  - S(-) means S is in the word but in the wrong position. Since our guess had S in the 4th position, the actual word has S somewhere else.
  - P(x) and O(x) mean P and O are not in the word.
  - E(✓) confirms E is still in the 5th position.

So, we know:
- The secret word has 5 letters: _ _ _ _ E
- The 3rd letter is I → so pattern: _ _ I _ E
- The word contains S, but not in the 4th position (because in ""poise"", S was in 4th and got ""-"" meaning it's present but wrong spot). So S must be in position 1, 2, or possibly 5? But position 5 is E, so S is in 1st or 2nd.
- Letters not in the word: C, R, A, N, P, O (from both guesses).
- Also, we have used: C,R,A,N,E,P,O,I,S. So avoided letters: C, R, A, N, P, O.

Now, we need to guess a word that fits:
- Must have pattern: _ _ I _ E
- Must contain S, and S must be in either position 1 or 2 (since it can't be in 3rd which is I or 4th which was wrong in guess2, or 5th which is E). So S is in 1st or 2nd.
- We know the word has I (3rd) and E (5th) and S (somewhere).

Also, we must avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, N, P, O.

Let's summarize the known:
- Position 3: I
- Position 5: E
- S is in the word, and must be in position 1 or 2.

Now, for the word: positions:
1: must be S or some other letter (but S must appear, so if not at 1, then at 2)
2: if S is not at 1, then must be at 2.

But note, S might be at position 1 and then we can have another letter at 2, or vice versa.

Let's think of possible words that have the form _ _ I _ E, contain S, and avoid C,R,A,N,P,O.

We need to choose a word that uses new letters to test, because we only know a few letters so far.

We know S, I, E are in the word, and I and E are fixed.

The missing letters are for positions 1, 2, and 4.

Position 4 is the only one without any info except it can't be S (because if S were in position 4, guess2 would have shown it as correct? But in guess2, S was in position 4 and got ""-"", meaning it's not fixed there).

So we are free to choose letters for positions 1, 2, 4, with constraints:
- The word must have S in position 1 or 2.
- The remaining positions (1 or 2 and 4) can be any other letters from the alphabet except C, R, A, N, P, O.
- And the word must be valid English.

We also have only 4 tries left (since we are on guess 3).

Let's list some possible words that fit: _ _ I _ E

And contain S.

Case 1: S at position 1 → words starting with ""SI?E"" → S X I Y E, where X and Y are letters not in the bad set.

Case 2: S at position 2 → words like X S I Y E.

Then, we must avoid C,R,A,N,P,O.

We also haven't tested many letters: for example, we have used C,R,A,N,E,P,O,I,S. So available: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

But we must form a valid word.

Let's brainstorm examples:

Case 1: S at position 1 → ""S""? I _ E
Examples:
- ""SMILE"" → S M I L E → positions: S(1), M(2), I(3), L(4), E(5). But L is new and M is new. And avoids bad letters.
- ""SHINE"" → S H I N E → but N is bad? We know N is not in the word (from first guess: N(x)). And also, in ""SHINE"", N is at position 4, but N is forbidden. So invalid.
- ""SKITE""? Not common.
- ""SPITE"" → but P is bad? P was used and got x, so P not in word → invalid.
So ""SMILE"" is a candidate.

Case 2: S at position 2 → _ S I _ E
Examples:
- ""USILE"" not valid.
- ""ASIDE"" → but A is bad → invalid.
- ""FSIZE"" not word.
- ""MSIZE"" not word.
- ""TWISE"" not common.
- ""SWIPE"" → S W I P E → but P is bad → invalid.
- ""SUITE"" → S U I T E → but here S is at position 2? Wait: positions: 1:? Let me see: if S at position 2, then it's X S I Y E.

For ""SUITE"": would be U S I T E? But ""suite"" is S-U-I-T-E? Oh, no, ""suite"" starts with S. Wait, if S is at position 2, then the word must be like X S I Y E.

""AXIS"" ends with S? We need E at the end.

Possible words: 
- ""ELSIE""? But that's E at start → word ""ELSIE"" is E-L-S-I-E → positions: E(1), L(2), S(3), I(4), E(5). But wait, we need I at position 3 and E at 5? Here E is at 1 and 5, I at 4? Not matching pattern.

Actually, we have pattern: position 3 must be I, 5 must be E.

So for S at pos2: _ S I _ E

Examples:
- ""USINE"" not valid.
- ""TOWIE"" not word? 
- ""BASIE?"" B A S I E → but A is bad → invalid.

Another word: ""SHIRE"" → S H I R E → but R is bad → invalid.

""WHITE"" → W H I T E → but does not have S? We must have S in the word → ""WHITE"" has no S.

We need the word to contain S.

So for position 2 being S: words like X S I Y E.

Valid English words: 
- ""ASSIE"" not proper.
- ""ESSIE""? Not common.
- ""dassie"" → D A S S I E → too long? But 5 letter: DASSIE is 6? 

Actually, 5-letter examples I can think of: 
- ""TSINE"" not common.
- ""PSION"" doesn't end with E.

Perhaps ""TASTE"" → T A S T E → but A is bad and pattern: position 3? We need I at pos3? ""TASTE"" has S at pos3? Not matching.

Wait, we must have I at position 3 → so the word must be: letter1, letter2, I, letter4, E.

And letter2 must be S? So: ? S I ? E

Known words: 
- ""USIAE"" not word.
- ""MASTI"" ends with I? No.

How about ""POSIE""? But O and P are bad? Wait, we have ""poise"" already.

Another one: ""DEVIE""? Not valid.

Perhaps I cannot find any word where S is at position 2? Maybe it's not common.

In English, common words ending with ""IE"" have S at the beginning? Let me think.

With pattern: _ _ I _ E, and S in the word at 1 or 2.

If S is at 2: then the form is ? S I ? E

Examples of valid words:
- ""ASSISI"" too long.
- ""CIVIE"" doesn't have S.
- ""COSIE"" O is bad.

Perhaps ""BUSBY"" doesn't end with E.

It might be that S at position 2 is rare. 

So possibly S is at position 1.

Therefore, let's focus on S at position 1: S ? I ? E

Examples:
- ""SMILE"": S M I L E
- ""SLITE"" (not common) → S L I T E
- ""SAICE"" but A is bad → invalid.
- ""SUITE"": S U I T E → but then the pattern: S U I T E → but we have I at position 3 and E at position 5, good. And S at position 1.

""SUITE"" is S, U, I, T, E → which has U and T.

But in ""poise"", we had S at position 4 and got ""-"", meaning S is in the word but not at 4. In ""SUITE"", S is at 1, so that's okay.

But note: in ""SUITE"", we have T at position 4. And U at position 2.

We haven't tested U or T.

So ""SUITE"" is a candidate.

Also, ""SHITE"" is vulgar and we should avoid? Not appropriate.

Also, ""SKITE"" may not be well known.

So good candidates: ""SMILE"" and ""SUITE"".

We also have: ""QUITE"" → Q U I T E, but Q is less common.

But ""SUITE"" and ""SMILE"" are good.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test more letters.

In ""SMILE"", we test M and L.
In ""SUITE"", we test U and T.

We haven't tested either set.

But note: we know position 4 in the secret word is open. We need to guess a word that will narrow down the possibilities.

If we guess ""SMILE"", we will test M in position 2 and L in position 4.

If we guess ""SUITE"", we test U in position 2 and T in position 4.

Both seem acceptable.

But note: ""poise"" had S in the 4th position and we got S(-), meaning S is not at 4. If we guess ""SUITE"", S is at 1, so if S is indeed at 1 in the secret word, we would get S(✓) if it's correct? Wait, but we don't know if S is at 1 or 2.

Actually, ""SUITE"" has S at 1, so if the secret word has S at 1, we will see S(✓) in the feedback for position 1.

Similarly, if we guess ""SMILE"" and S is at 1, we get S(✓).

But note, regardless, we are testing S at position 1 explicitly.

If we get S(✓), then we know S is at position 1.

If we get S(-), that would mean S is in the word but not at 1? But that cannot be because if S is not at 1, then it must be at 2 (since positions 3,4,5 are either I,4th unknown, E).

But if S is at 2, and we put it at 1, then we get S(-) meaning it's in the word but wrong position, so S must be at position 2.

Therefore, by guessing a word that has S at position 1, we can determine whether S is at 1 or 2.

We need to do this because we don't know S's position.

Therefore, we should design our next guess to have S at position 1 to test position 1.

Because in the wild, S could be in 1 or 2.

So picking a word with S at position 1 will tell us:

- If S(✓), then position 1 is S.
- If S(-), then position 1 must be something else, and S must be at position 2.

Therefore, we should choose a word that has S at position 1 and other new letters.

For example: ""SUITE"" or ""SMILE"".

Both are valid.

Let us choose ""SUITE"" because it uses U and T, which are common consonants and vowels, respectively.

""SUITE"": S at 1, U at 2, I at 3, T at 4, E at 5.

We know I (3) and E (5) will be ✓, so we get info on U and T.

If ""SUITE"" is the word, we win.

Otherwise, feedback will tell us about U and T.

We might also consider ""SHINE"", but N is bad → invalid.

So ""SUITE"" seems good.

But let me confirm: in ""SUITE"", position 4 is T, which we don't know.

And we avoid bad letters: C,R,A,N,P,O.

Yes, U and T are not forbidden.

Similarly, ""SMILE"" has M and L.

But why ""SUITE"" over ""SMILE""? Not a strong reason. Both would work.

But note: position 4 in the secret word might be T or not, etc.

I think ""SUITE"" is a common word.

So I will go with ""SUITE"".

Therefore, third guess: ""SUITE""

In the response, we will return that.Based on the feedback:
- **First guess ""crane""**: E is confirmed in the correct 5th position (✓), and C, R, A, N are absent (x).
- **Second guess ""poise""**: I is confirmed in the correct 3rd position (✓), E is confirmed again in the 5th position (✓), S is present but not in the 4th position (-), and P and O are absent (x). 

### Key deductions:
- **Pattern**: The secret word must match the pattern `_  _  I  _  E`.
- **S position**: Since S is in the word but not in position 4 (from ""poise"" feedback), and positions 3 (I) and 5 (E) are fixed, S must be in position 1 or 2.
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N (from ""crane""), P, O (from ""poise"") are not in the word. Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- **Strategy**: Focus on:
  - Testing the position of S (i.e., is it in position 1 or 2?).
  - Using new, common letters to gain more information.
  - Avoiding the known absent letters.

### Optimal next guess: ""SUITE""
- **Why ""SUITE""?**
  - **Pattern match**: SUITE → S (pos1), U (pos2), I (pos3), T (pos4), E (pos5). This fits `_ _ I _ E`, with I and E in their confirmed positions.
  - **Tests S position**: By placing S in position 1, the feedback will pinpoint S's location:
    - If S is ✓, S is in position 1.
    - If S is -, S must be in position 2 (since it cannot be in position 3, 4, or 5).
  - **U and T**: Tests new letters (U and T) that are common vowels/consonants and haven't been tried yet.
  - **Avoids absent letters**: No C, R, A, N, P, or O.
  - **Word validity**: ""SUITE"" is a valid 5-letter English word (meaning a set of rooms or a musical composition).

### Expected outcomes:
- The feedback will clarify:
  - The exact position of S.
  - Whether U and T are present and their positions.
- This narrows possibilities efficiently for the next guess.

""STOLE"" -> letters: S, T, O, L, E\n2. ""SPIKE"" -> S, P, I, K, E\n3. ""STYLE"" -> S, T, Y, L, E\n4. ""PHONE"" -> P, H, O, N, E -> but N is not allowed?

So invalid.\n\n""POISE"" -> P, O, I, S, E -> this works: no A, C, R, N.\n\nSimilarly, ""NOISE"" -> but N is not allowed.\n\nSo ""POISE"" is acceptable: P, O, I, S, E.\n\nWe can also consider ""QUITE"" -> Q, U, I, T, E -> but Q is less common, and we might not want to use it.\n\nAnother one: ""MOIST"" -> but doesn\'t end with E? We need E at the end.\n\nSo we must have E at the end.\n\nTherefore, ""POISE"" is a good candidate: it tests P, O, I, S, and E (which we know is at the end).\n\nBut note: in ""POISE"", the E is at the end, so that\'s fixed.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""HOUSE"": H, O, U, S, E -> tests H, O, U, S.\n\nI think both are good.\n\nBut let\'s see which one covers more common letters.\n\nWe have to consider that the secret word might have S, T, L, etc.\n\nI think ""STOLE"" is a solid choice because it tests S, T, O, L.\n\nWe can also consider ""SLIME"": S, L, I, M, E -> tests M and I.\n\nBut let\'s go with ""STOLE"" for now.\n\nHowever, note that in the first guess, we had E at the end, and now we are putting E at the end again, which is fine because we know it\'s correct.\n\nBut we are not getting new information about E, but that\'s okay because we are using that known position to test other letters.\n\nSo I will go with ""STOLE"".\n\nBut let me check if ""STOLE"" is a valid word: yes, it means to take something without permission.\n\nAlternatively, we can use ""SPILE"" but that might be less common.\n\nI think ""STOLE"" is better.\n\nBut wait, we have the letter O. We don\'t know if O is in the word.\n\nAnother candidate: ""SUITE"" -> S, U, I, T, E -> tests U and I.\n\nBut I think ""STOLE"" is fine.\n\nWe can also consider ""SHIRE"" but that has R? We know R is not in the word (from first feedback: R was x). So we cannot use R.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid R.\n\nSo ""STOLE"" does not have R, so it\'s okay.\n\nSimilarly, ""POISE"" is also okay.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""POISE"" because it tests three vowels: O and I, and also P and S.\n\nBut ""POISE"" has O, I, and S.\n\nAlternatively, ""HOUSE"" has O, U, and S.\n\nBut U is less common than I? Not necessarily.\n\nWe can choose either.\n\nLet me pick ""POISE"" because it has two new vowels (O and I) and two consonants (P and S).\n\nSo second guess: ""POISE""\n\nBut note: in ""POISE"", the E is at the end, which we know is correct.\n\nSo we are testing the first four letters: P, O, I, S.\n\nIf we get feedback, we can know about these letters.\n\nTherefore, I will guess ""POISE"".\n\nBut let me confirm: the word is ""POISE"", which is a valid English word meaning composure.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the guess is ""POISE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, A, and N are not in the secret word (all marked as ""x"").\n- E is in the secret word and in the correct position (5th letter, marked as ""✓"").\n\nTherefore, the secret word ends with ""E"" and does not contain C, R, A, or N. For the second guess:\n- The word must end with ""E"" to confirm or build on the known position.\n- Avoid using C, R, A, or N to focus on new letters.\n- Prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, O, I, P, L) to maximize information gain.\n\nA strong second guess is ""POISE"" because:\n- It ends with ""E"", leveraging the known correct position.\n- It tests new common letters: P, O, I, S.\n- It avoids C, R, A, and N.\n- As a valid English word, it provides broad coverage of vowels (O, I) and consonants (P, S).\n\nThis guess will help identify if any of P, O, I, or S are in the word and their positions, narrowing down possibilities for subsequent guesses.\n\n<guess>poise</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: poise -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(✓) S(-) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given:\n- For ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓) → so E is in the word and in the correct position (5th), and C, R, A, N are not in the word.\n- For ""poise"": P(x), O(x), I(✓), S(-), E(✓) → \n  - I(✓) means I is in the word and in the correct position, which is the 3rd letter (since ""poise"" is P-O-I-S-E).\n  - S(-) means S is in the word but in the wrong position.

We know N is not in the word (from first guess: N(x)). And also, in ""SHINE"", N is at position 4, but N is forbidden. So invalid.\n- ""SKITE""? Not common.\n- ""SPITE"" → but P is bad? P was used and got x, so P not in word → invalid.\nSo ""SMILE"" is a candidate.\n\nCase 2: S at position 2 → _ S I _ E\nExamples:\n- ""USILE"" not valid.\n- ""ASIDE"" → but A is bad → invalid.\n- ""FSIZE"" not word.\n- ""MSIZE"" not word.\n- ""TWISE"" not common.\n- ""SWIPE"" → S W I P E → but P is bad → invalid.\n- ""SUITE"" → S U I T E → but here S is at position 2? Wait: positions: 1:? Let me see: if S at position 2, then it\'s X S I Y E.\n\nFor ""SUITE"": would be U S I T E? But ""suite"" is S-U-I-T-E? Oh, no, ""suite"" starts with S. Wait, if S is at position 2, then the word must be like X S I Y E.\n\n""AXIS"" ends with S? We need E at the end.\n\nPossible words: \n- ""ELSIE""? But that\'s E at start → word ""ELSIE"" is E-L-S-I-E → positions: E(1), L(2), S(3), I(4), E(5). But wait, we need I at position 3 and E at 5? Here E is at 1 and 5, I at 4? Not matching pattern.\n\nActually, we have pattern: position 3 must be I, 5 must be E.\n\nSo for S at pos2: _ S I _ E\n\nExamples:\n- ""USINE"" not valid.\n- ""TOWIE"" not word? \n- ""BASIE?"" B A S I E → but A is bad → invalid.\n\nAnother word: ""SHIRE"" → S H I R E → but R is bad → invalid.\n\n""WHITE"" → W H I T E → but does not have S? We must have S in the word → ""WHITE"" has no S.\n\nWe need the word to contain S.\n\nSo for position 2 being S: words like X S I Y E.\n\nValid English words: \n- ""ASSIE"" not proper.\n- ""ESSIE""? Not common.\n- ""dassie"" → D A S S I E → too long? But 5 letter: DASSIE is 6? \n\nActually, 5-letter examples I can think of: \n- ""TSINE"" not common.\n- ""PSION"" doesn\'t end with E.\n\nPerhaps ""TASTE"" → T A S T E → but A is bad and pattern: position 3? We need I at pos3? ""TASTE"" has S at pos3? Not matching.\n\nWait, we must have I at position 3 → so the word must be: letter1, letter2, I, letter4, E.\n\nAnd letter2 must be S? So: ? S I ? E\n\nKnown words: \n- ""USIAE"" not word.\n- ""MASTI"" ends with I? No.\n\nHow about ""POSIE""? But O and P are bad? Wait, we have ""poise"" already.\n\nAnother one: ""DEVIE""? Not valid.\n\nPerhaps I cannot find any word where S is at position 2? Maybe it\'s not common.\n\nIn English, common words ending with ""IE"" have S at the beginning? Let me think.\n\nWith pattern: _ _ I _ E, and S in the word at 1 or 2.\n\nIf S is at 2: then the form is ? S I ? E\n\nExamples of valid words:\n- ""ASSISI"" too long.\n- ""CIVIE"" doesn\'t have S.\n- ""COSIE"" O is bad.\n\nPerhaps ""BUSBY"" doesn\'t end with E.\n\nIt might be that S at position 2 is rare. \n\nSo possibly S is at position 1.\n\nTherefore, let\'s focus on S at position 1: S ? I ? E\n\nExamples:\n- ""SMILE"": S M I L E\n- ""SLITE"" (not common) → S L I T E\n- ""SAICE"" but A is bad → invalid.\n- ""SUITE"": S U I T E → but then the pattern: S U I T E → but we have I at position 3 and E at position 5, good. And S at position 1.\n\n""SUITE"" is S, U, I, T, E → which has U and T.\n\nBut in ""poise"", we had S at position 4 and got ""-"", meaning S is in the word but not at 4. In ""SUITE"", S is at 1, so that\'s okay.\n\nBut note: in ""SUITE"", we have T at position 4. And U at position 2.\n\nWe haven\'t tested U or T.\n\nSo ""SUITE"" is a candidate.\n\nAlso, ""SHITE"" is vulgar and we should avoid? Not appropriate.\n\nAlso, ""SKITE"" may not be well known.\n\nSo good candidates: ""SMILE"" and ""SUITE"".\n\nWe also have: ""QUITE"" → Q U I T E, but Q is less common.\n\nBut ""SUITE"" and ""SMILE"" are good.\n\nNow, which one to choose? We want to test more letters.\n\nIn ""SMILE"", we test M and L.\nIn ""SUITE"", we test U and T.\n\nWe haven\'t tested either set.\n\nBut note: we know position 4 in the secret word is open. We need to guess a word that will narrow down the possibilities.\n\nIf we guess ""SMILE"", we will test M in position 2 and L in position 4.\n\nIf we guess ""SUITE"", we test U in position 2 and T in position 4.\n\nBoth seem acceptable.\n\nBut note: ""poise"" had S in the 4th position and we got S(-), meaning S is not at 4. If we guess ""SUITE"", S is at 1, so if S is indeed at 1 in the secret word, we would get S(✓) if it\'s correct? Wait, but we don\'t know if S is at 1 or 2.\n\nActually, ""SUITE"" has S at 1, so if the secret word has S at 1, we will see S(✓) in the feedback for position 1.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess ""SMILE"" and S is at 1, we get S(✓).\n\nBut note, regardless, we are testing S at position 1 explicitly.\n\nIf we get S(✓), then we know S is at position 1.\n\nIf we get S(-), that would mean S is in the word but not at 1? But that cannot be because if S is not at 1, then it must be at 2 (since positions 3,4,5 are either I,4th unknown, E).\n\nBut if S is at 2, and we put it at 1, then we get S(-) meaning it\'s in the word but wrong position, so S must be at position 2.\n\nTherefore, by guessing a word that has S at position 1, we can determine whether S is at 1 or 2.\n\nWe need to do this because we don\'t know S\'s position.\n\nTherefore, we should design our next guess to have S at position 1 to test position 1.\n\nBecause in the wild, S could be in 1 or 2.\n\nSo picking a word with S at position 1 will tell us:\n\n- If S(✓), then position 1 is S.\n- If S(-), then position 1 must be something else, and S must be at position 2.\n\nTherefore, we should choose a word that has S at position 1 and other new letters.\n\nFor example: ""SUITE"" or ""SMILE"".\n\nBoth are valid.\n\nLet us choose ""SUITE"" because it uses U and T, which are common consonants and vowels, respectively.\n\n""SUITE"": S at 1, U at 2, I at 3, T at 4, E at 5.\n\nWe know I (3) and E (5) will be ✓, so we get info on U and T.\n\nIf ""SUITE"" is the word, we win.\n\nOtherwise, feedback will tell us about U and T.\n\nWe might also consider ""SHINE"", but N is bad → invalid.\n\nSo ""SUITE"" seems good.\n\nBut let me confirm: in ""SUITE"", position 4 is T, which we don\'t know.\n\nAnd we avoid bad letters: C,R,A,N,P,O.\n\nYes, U and T are not forbidden.\n\nSimilarly, ""SMILE"" has M and L.\n\nBut why ""SUITE"" over ""SMILE""? Not a strong reason. Both would work.\n\nBut note: position 4 in the secret word might be T or not, etc.\n\nI think ""SUITE"" is a common word.\n\nSo I will go with ""SUITE"".\n\nTherefore, third guess: ""SUITE""\n\nIn the response, we will return that.Based on the feedback:\n- **First guess ""crane""**: E is confirmed in the correct 5th position (✓), and C, R, A, N are absent (x).\n- **Second guess ""poise""**: I is confirmed in the correct 3rd position (✓), E is confirmed again in the 5th position (✓), S is present but not in the 4th position (-), and P and O are absent (x). \n\n### Key deductions:\n- **Pattern**: The secret word must match the pattern `_  _  I  _  E`.\n- **S position**: Since S is in the word but not in position 4 (from ""poise"" feedback), and positions 3 (I) and 5 (E) are fixed, S must be in position 1 or 2.\n- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N (from ""crane""), P, O (from ""poise"") are not in the word. Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n- **Strategy**: Focus on:\n  - Testing the position of S (i.e., is it in position 1 or 2?).\n  - Using new, common letters to gain more information.\n  - Avoiding the known absent letters.\n\n### Optimal next guess: ""SUITE""\n- **Why ""SUITE""?**\n  - **Pattern match**: SUITE → S (pos1), U (pos2), I (pos3), T (pos4), E (pos5). This fits `_ _ I _ E`, with I and E in their confirmed positions.\n  - **Tests S position**: By placing S in position 1, the feedback will pinpoint S\'s location:\n    - If S is ✓, S is in position 1.\n    - If S is -, S must be in position 2 (since it cannot be in position 3, 4, or 5).\n  - **U and T**: Tests new letters (U and T) that are common vowels/consonants and haven\'t been tried yet.\n  - **Avoids absent letters**: No C, R, A, N, P, or O.\n  - **Word validity**: ""SUITE"" is a valid 5-letter English word (meaning a set of rooms or a musical composition).\n\n### Expected outcomes:\n- The feedback will clarify:\n  - The exact position of S.\n  - Whether U and T are present and their positions.\n- This narrows possibilities efficiently for the next guess.\n\n<guess>suite</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: poise -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(✓) S(-) E(✓)\nGuess 3: suite -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) U(x) I(✓) T(x) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given the following feedback:

Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).
- C, R, A, N are not in the word.

Guess 2: poise -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(✓) S(-) E(✓)
- I is in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter). 
- E is in the correct position (5th letter).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (guessed in 4th, so it cannot be in 4th).
- P and O are not in the word.

Guess 3: suite -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) U(x) I(✓) T(x) E(✓)
- S is in the word and in the correct position (1st letter).
- U is not in the word.
- I is in the correct position (3rd letter).
- T is not in the word.
- E is in the correct position (5th letter).

From this, we know the secret word has the pattern: S _ I _ E 
- The first letter is S, third is I, fifth is E.
- The word does not contain: C, R, A, N, P, O, U, T (from absent letters in guesses).
- S is in position 1, so the previous feedback from ""poise"" that S is present but not in position 4 is consistent.

We are missing letters in positions 2 and 4.

Let's list the absent letters: C, R, A, N, P, O, U, T.

So, available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Since the word is S _ I _ E, we know:
- Position 2: must be one of the available letters.
- Position 4: must be one of the available letters.

The word must be a valid English word.

Possible words: We need to find 5-letter words starting with S, third letter I, fifth letter E, and the second and fourth letters from the available set.

Common words that fit:
- SHIRE: But R is absent (from guess1) and E is the last letter. Also, H might be possible? But R is forbidden -> invalid.
- SLICE: But L and C? C is absent -> invalid.
- SHINE: H and N? N absent -> invalid.
- SMILE: M and L -> both available? Let's check: M not absent, L not absent, and E at end. So ""smile"" is S M I L E -> positions: S(1), M(2), I(3), L(4), E(5). Available letters include M and L.

Is ""smile"" a valid word? Yes.

Other options:
- SPITE: P absent -> invalid.
- SLIME: S L I M E -> L and M are available. So ""slime"".
- SHITE: vulgar, avoid? Also H might be tested.
- SMILE and SLIME are both possible.

But are there more?
- SHIVE: H and V -> possible? ""shive"" means a thin slice or a splinter. But let's see pattern: S H I V E -> H in position 2, V in position 4.
- SKIVE: S K I V E -> K and V.
- STILE: T absent -> invalid (T not allowed).
- SWIVE: S W I V E -> W and V.

But we have missed one: We already know U is absent, so we can use others.

To maximize information, we want to test letters that are common and haven't been tried.

We haven't used H, L, M, K, etc.

Since we have a pattern, we can guess a word that might be the solution.

Given we know S,I,E and missing only two letters.

We have 4 tries left? Actually, we are at guess 3, so we have 3 more guesses after this.

We can try ""smile"" to test M and L.

If ""smile"" is correct, we win. Otherwise, we get feedback.

Similarly, we can try ""slice"", but C absent -> not possible.

Let me list all possible words with pattern S?I?E and no forbidden letters.

Allowable letters for position 2 and 4: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common words:
- SMILE: M and L -> S M I L E
- SLIME: L and M -> S L I M E
- SHINE: H and N -> N absent -> invalid
- SHIRE: H and R -> R absent -> invalid
- SKIVE: K and V -> S K I V E
- SHIVE: H and V -> S H I V E
- SPINE: P absent -> invalid
- SUITE: already guessed? But U absent -> not the word.

Also: ""SMIKE"" not common? 
- ""SHITE"" not appropriate.

Another: ""SWIPE"": P and W -> P absent -> invalid.

""SNIDE"": N absent -> invalid.

""SPIKE"": P absent -> invalid.

""STIME"" not common.

So plausible common words: SMILE, SLIME, SKIVE, SHIVE, etc.

To choose between them, we can guess a word that uses common letters.

We can also consider ""SMILE"" because it is common.

We might also use a word that tests H, etc.

But let me note: in our history, we haven't tested M, L, H, V, etc.

Therefore, ""SMILE"" would test M and L: 
- Position 2: M
- Position 4: L

If correct, we win.

If not, we get feedback.

Similarly, if we guess ""SHIVE"", we test H and V.

Which is better? We don't know.

But M and L are very common, so ""SMILE"" is a good choice.

Alternatively, we can avoid repeating letters? But SMILE has distinct letters.

But note: the secret word might have repeated letters? Possible, but we have no indication so far.

But in this case, positions 2 and 4 are different letters.

Now, if we guess ""SMILE"" and it's wrong, the feedback will tell us:
- If M is correct, absent, or wrong spot? Since M is at position 2.
- Similarly for L at position 4.

But we don't know if either is in the word.

Another candidate: ""SHIMY"" doesn't end with E? Not.

So, I think ""SMILE"" is the way to go.

We can also consider ""SWIPE"" but P absent -> invalid.

So, our third guess was ""SUITE"", and now fourth guess I propose ""SMILE"".

But note: if the secret word were ""smile"", we would have known that S is in the word from guess2, but guess2 had S in position 4 which is its wrong spot? No, the word has S at position 1, so in guess2, S was in position 4 and got ""-"" meaning that it is present but not at position 4, which is consistent.

Also, in the secret word, the S at position 1 would have been detected.

So, no conflict.

Therefore, I choose ""SMILE"" for the fourth guess.

So the word is ""SMILE"".
</think>
Based on the feedback:
- **Pattern locked**: The secret word is confirmed as `S _ I _ E` (S in position 1, I in position 3, E in position 5).
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N (from guess 1), P, O (from guess 2), U, T (from guess 3). So absent: C, R, A, N, P, O, U, T.
- **Present letters**: S (position 1), I (position 3), E (position 5), and S is already placed.  
- **Unknown positions**: Letter 2 and letter 4 must be from the remaining available letters (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z).

### Strategy for next guess:
- Focus on testing **common letters** for positions 2 and 4 (e.g., H, L, M, D, G) to narrow down possibilities.
- Avoid repeating known absent letters or confirmed letter positions.  
- Prioritize words with high-likelihood letters (e.g., L, M, H) to maximize information gain.  

### Optimal guess: ""SMILE""
- **Why ""SMILE""?**
  - Tests ""M"" in position 2 and ""L"" in position 4—both common, untested letters.
  - Fits the pattern `S _ I _ E` (S✓, M?, I✓, L?, E✓).
  - If correct, solves the puzzle. If incorrect, feedback will reveal:
    - Whether M or L is present/absent.
    - Whether M is correctly placed (position 2) or L is correctly placed (position 4).
  - Uses no absent letters (M and L are available).

Alternatives like ""SHINE"" (invalid due to absent N) or ""SLICE"" (invalid due to absent C) were rejected. ""SMILE"" is a valid common word.

<guess>smile</guess>",smile,"We are given the following feedback:

Guess 2: poise -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(✓) S(-) E(✓)

- S is in position 1, so the previous feedback from ""poise"" that S is present but not in position 4 is consistent.

We are missing letters in positions 2 and 4.

Let's list the absent letters: C, R, A, N, P, O, U, T.

So, available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Is ""smile"" a valid word? Yes.

Other options:
- SPITE: P absent -> invalid.

- SHITE: vulgar, avoid? Also H might be tested.
- SMILE and SLIME are both possible.

But are there more?
- SHIVE: H and V -> possible? ""shive"" means a thin slice or a splinter. But let's see pattern: S H I V E -> H in position 2, V in position 4.
- SKIVE: S K I V E -> K and V.
- STILE: T absent -> invalid (T not allowed).
- SWIVE: S W I V E -> W and V.

But we have missed one: We already know U is absent, so we can use others.

To maximize information, we want to test letters that are common and haven't been tried.

We haven't used H, L, M, K, etc.

If ""smile"" is correct, we win. Otherwise, we get feedback.

Similarly, we can try ""slice"", but C absent -> not possible.

Let me list all possible words with pattern S?I?E and no forbidden letters.

Allowable letters for position 2 and 4: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common words:

- ""SHITE"" not appropriate.

Another: ""SWIPE"": P and W -> P absent -> invalid.

""SNIDE"": N absent -> invalid.

""SPIKE"": P absent -> invalid.

""STIME"" not common.

So plausible common words: SMILE, SLIME, SKIVE, SHIVE, etc.

To choose between them, we can guess a word that uses common letters.

We can also consider ""SMILE"" because it is common.

We might also use a word that tests H, etc.

Another candidate: ""SHIMY"" doesn't end with E? Not.

So, I think ""SMILE"" is the way to go.

We can also consider ""SWIPE"" but P absent -> invalid.

So, our third guess was ""SUITE"", and now fourth guess I propose ""SMILE"".

But note: if the secret word were ""smile"", we would have known that S is in the word from guess2, but guess2 had S in position 4 which is its wrong spot? No, the word has S at position 1, so in guess2, S was in position 4 and got ""-"" meaning that it is present but not at position 4, which is consistent.

Also, in the secret word, the S at position 1 would have been detected.

So, no conflict.

Therefore, I choose ""SMILE"" for the fourth guess.

So the word is ""SMILE"".Based on the feedback:
- **Pattern locked**: The secret word is confirmed as `S _ I _ E` (S in position 1, I in position 3, E in position 5).
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N (from guess 1), P, O (from guess 2), U, T (from guess 3). So absent: C, R, A, N, P, O, U, T.

 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all are distinct.

 So, our first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the last letter of the secret word)

Therefore, the secret word ends with E and does not contain C, R, A, or N.

Since E is in the 5th position, we know the word ends with E.

We need to make a second guess. We should avoid using the letters C, R, A, N (since they are not in the word) and we know E is in the word and must be in the last position.

We also note that the word does not have any of the letters C, R, A, N. So we must choose a word that:
- Has E in the 5th position (because we know it's correct there)
- Uses other letters that are common and not in the set {C, R, A, N}

We can consider words that end with E and use other vowels and common consonants.

Possible letters to use: We have 26 letters minus C, R, A, N, and we know E is fixed at the end.

We have 4 positions to fill (positions 1 to 4) and we must avoid C, R, A, N.

We also want to test new letters to get more information.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we also know that the word must be a valid English word.

Good candidates: We can try a word that has a lot of common consonants and vowels that we haven't tested.

Let's think of words ending with E that don't contain C, R, A, N.

Examples: 
- ""SLATE"" -> but S, L, T are new, but we know A is not in the word? Wait, feedback said A is not in the word, so we cannot use A. Similarly, we cannot use C, R, N.

So we must avoid A, C, R, N.

Let's try to think of words ending in E without A, C, R, N.

Some ideas:
- ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> but O and L are new, and we avoid A, C, R, N. So this is acceptable.
- ""SPIKE"": S, P, I, K, E -> also acceptable.
- ""STYLE"": S, T, Y, L, E -> acceptable.

But we also want to cover vowels. We haven't tested O, I, U, etc.

Since we know the last letter is E, we can focus on the first four.

We might also consider that the word has E and we know it's at the end, so we can test other vowels in the first four positions.

Let me list a few words that end with E and don't have A, C, R, N:
- ""BIKE"" -> but that's 4 letters, we need 5. So 5-letter words.
- ""BIBLE"" -> has B, I, B, L, E -> but B repeats? We don't know if repetition is allowed, but the secret word might have repeated letters? However, the feedback doesn't indicate that, so we avoid repetition for now to maximize information.

Actually, the rules don't say the word can't have repeated letters, but in the example, there were no repeats. So it's possible, but for a second guess, we might avoid repeats.

Let me think of words without repeated letters and without A, C, R, N, and ending with E.

Some options:
1. ""STOLE"" -> letters: S, T, O, L, E
2. ""SPIKE"" -> S, P, I, K, E
3. ""STYLE"" -> S, T, Y, L, E
4. ""PHONE"" -> P, H, O, N, E -> but N is not allowed? Feedback said N is not in the word, so we cannot use N. So ""PHONE"" is invalid because of N.
5. ""MOUSE"" -> M, O, U, S, E -> U is a vowel we haven't tested.

We can also consider ""HOUSE"", but H, O, U, S, E.

But let's choose one that tests more common letters.

I think ""STOLE"" is a good candidate because it has S, T, O, L which are common.

Alternatively, ""SPIKE"" tests P, I, K which are also common.

But note: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to test.

Another idea: since we know E is at the end, we can try to test other common vowels in the first positions.

For example, we haven't tested I, O, U.

We can try a word that has I and O and other new consonants.

But we have to avoid A, C, R, N.

Let me try to find a word that has I and O and ends with E, without A, C, R, N.

Example: ""VOICE"" -> V, O, I, C, E -> but C is not allowed (we know C is not in the word). So invalid.

""POISE"" -> P, O, I, S, E -> this works: no A, C, R, N.

Similarly, ""NOISE"" -> but N is not allowed.

So ""POISE"" is acceptable: P, O, I, S, E.

We can also consider ""QUITE"" -> Q, U, I, T, E -> but Q is less common, and we might not want to use it.

Another one: ""MOIST"" -> but doesn't end with E? We need E at the end.

So we must have E at the end.

Therefore, ""POISE"" is a good candidate: it tests P, O, I, S, and E (which we know is at the end).

But note: in ""POISE"", the E is at the end, so that's fixed.

Alternatively, we can try ""HOUSE"": H, O, U, S, E -> tests H, O, U, S.

I think both are good.

But let's see which one covers more common letters.

We have to consider that the secret word might have S, T, L, etc.

I think ""STOLE"" is a solid choice because it tests S, T, O, L.

We can also consider ""SLIME"": S, L, I, M, E -> tests M and I.

But let's go with ""STOLE"" for now.

However, note that in the first guess, we had E at the end, and now we are putting E at the end again, which is fine because we know it's correct.

But we are not getting new information about E, but that's okay because we are using that known position to test other letters.

So I will go with ""STOLE"".

But let me check if ""STOLE"" is a valid word: yes, it means to take something without permission.

Alternatively, we can use ""SPILE"" but that might be less common.

I think ""STOLE"" is better.

But wait, we have the letter O. We don't know if O is in the word.

Another candidate: ""SUITE"" -> S, U, I, T, E -> tests U and I.

But I think ""STOLE"" is fine.

We can also consider ""SHIRE"" but that has R? We know R is not in the word (from first feedback: R was x). So we cannot use R.

Therefore, we must avoid R.

So ""STOLE"" does not have R, so it's okay.

Similarly, ""POISE"" is also okay.

I think I'll go with ""POISE"" because it tests three vowels: O and I, and also P and S.

But ""POISE"" has O, I, and S.

Alternatively, ""HOUSE"" has O, U, and S.

But U is less common than I? Not necessarily.

We can choose either.

Let me pick ""POISE"" because it has two new vowels (O and I) and two consonants (P and S).

So second guess: ""POISE""

But note: in ""POISE"", the E is at the end, which we know is correct.

So we are testing the first four letters: P, O, I, S.

If we get feedback, we can know about these letters.

Therefore, I will guess ""POISE"".

But let me confirm: the word is ""POISE"", which is a valid English word meaning composure.

Yes.

So the guess is ""POISE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and N are not in the secret word (all marked as ""x"").
- E is in the secret word and in the correct position (5th letter, marked as ""✓"").

Therefore, the secret word ends with ""E"" and does not contain C, R, A, or N. For the second guess:
- The word must end with ""E"" to confirm or build on the known position.
- Avoid using C, R, A, or N to focus on new letters.
- Prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, O, I, P, L) to maximize information gain.

A strong second guess is ""POISE"" because:
- It ends with ""E"", leveraging the known correct position.
- It tests new common letters: P, O, I, S.
- It avoids C, R, A, and N.
- As a valid English word, it provides broad coverage of vowels (O, I) and consonants (P, S).

This guess will help identify if any of P, O, I, or S are in the word and their positions, narrowing down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

<guess>poise</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: poise -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(✓) S(-) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given:
- For ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓) → so E is in the word and in the correct position (5th), and C, R, A, N are not in the word.
- For ""poise"": P(x), O(x), I(✓), S(-), E(✓) → 
  - I(✓) means I is in the word and in the correct position, which is the 3rd letter (since ""poise"" is P-O-I-S-E).
  - S(-) means S is in the word but in the wrong position. Since our guess had S in the 4th position, the actual word has S somewhere else.
  - P(x) and O(x) mean P and O are not in the word.
  - E(✓) confirms E is still in the 5th position.

So, we know:
- The secret word has 5 letters: _ _ _ _ E
- The 3rd letter is I → so pattern: _ _ I _ E
- The word contains S, but not in the 4th position (because in ""poise"", S was in 4th and got ""-"" meaning it's present but wrong spot). So S must be in position 1, 2, or possibly 5? But position 5 is E, so S is in 1st or 2nd.
- Letters not in the word: C, R, A, N, P, O (from both guesses).
- Also, we have used: C,R,A,N,E,P,O,I,S. So avoided letters: C, R, A, N, P, O.

Now, we need to guess a word that fits:
- Must have pattern: _ _ I _ E
- Must contain S, and S must be in either position 1 or 2 (since it can't be in 3rd which is I or 4th which was wrong in guess2, or 5th which is E). So S is in 1st or 2nd.
- We know the word has I (3rd) and E (5th) and S (somewhere).

Also, we must avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, N, P, O.

Let's summarize the known:
- Position 3: I
- Position 5: E
- S is in the word, and must be in position 1 or 2.

Now, for the word: positions:
1: must be S or some other letter (but S must appear, so if not at 1, then at 2)
2: if S is not at 1, then must be at 2.

But note, S might be at position 1 and then we can have another letter at 2, or vice versa.

Let's think of possible words that have the form _ _ I _ E, contain S, and avoid C,R,A,N,P,O.

We need to choose a word that uses new letters to test, because we only know a few letters so far.

We know S, I, E are in the word, and I and E are fixed.

The missing letters are for positions 1, 2, and 4.

Position 4 is the only one without any info except it can't be S (because if S were in position 4, guess2 would have shown it as correct? But in guess2, S was in position 4 and got ""-"", meaning it's not fixed there).

So we are free to choose letters for positions 1, 2, 4, with constraints:
- The word must have S in position 1 or 2.
- The remaining positions (1 or 2 and 4) can be any other letters from the alphabet except C, R, A, N, P, O.
- And the word must be valid English.

We also have only 4 tries left (since we are on guess 3).

Let's list some possible words that fit: _ _ I _ E

And contain S.

Case 1: S at position 1 → words starting with ""SI?E"" → S X I Y E, where X and Y are letters not in the bad set.

Case 2: S at position 2 → words like X S I Y E.

Then, we must avoid C,R,A,N,P,O.

We also haven't tested many letters: for example, we have used C,R,A,N,E,P,O,I,S. So available: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

But we must form a valid word.

Let's brainstorm examples:

Case 1: S at position 1 → ""S""? I _ E
Examples:
- ""SMILE"" → S M I L E → positions: S(1), M(2), I(3), L(4), E(5). But L is new and M is new. And avoids bad letters.
- ""SHINE"" → S H I N E → but N is bad? We know N is not in the word (from first guess: N(x)). And also, in ""SHINE"", N is at position 4, but N is forbidden. So invalid.
- ""SKITE""? Not common.
- ""SPITE"" → but P is bad? P was used and got x, so P not in word → invalid.
So ""SMILE"" is a candidate.

Case 2: S at position 2 → _ S I _ E
Examples:
- ""USILE"" not valid.
- ""ASIDE"" → but A is bad → invalid.
- ""FSIZE"" not word.
- ""MSIZE"" not word.
- ""TWISE"" not common.
- ""SWIPE"" → S W I P E → but P is bad → invalid.
- ""SUITE"" → S U I T E → but here S is at position 2? Wait: positions: 1:? Let me see: if S at position 2, then it's X S I Y E.

For ""SUITE"": would be U S I T E? But ""suite"" is S-U-I-T-E? Oh, no, ""suite"" starts with S. Wait, if S is at position 2, then the word must be like X S I Y E.

""AXIS"" ends with S? We need E at the end.

Possible words: 
- ""ELSIE""? But that's E at start → word ""ELSIE"" is E-L-S-I-E → positions: E(1), L(2), S(3), I(4), E(5). But wait, we need I at position 3 and E at 5? Here E is at 1 and 5, I at 4? Not matching pattern.

Actually, we have pattern: position 3 must be I, 5 must be E.

So for S at pos2: _ S I _ E

Examples:
- ""USINE"" not valid.
- ""TOWIE"" not word? 
- ""BASIE?"" B A S I E → but A is bad → invalid.

Another word: ""SHIRE"" → S H I R E → but R is bad → invalid.

""WHITE"" → W H I T E → but does not have S? We must have S in the word → ""WHITE"" has no S.

We need the word to contain S.

So for position 2 being S: words like X S I Y E.

Valid English words: 
- ""ASSIE"" not proper.
- ""ESSIE""? Not common.
- ""dassie"" → D A S S I E → too long? But 5 letter: DASSIE is 6? 

Actually, 5-letter examples I can think of: 
- ""TSINE"" not common.
- ""PSION"" doesn't end with E.

Perhaps ""TASTE"" → T A S T E → but A is bad and pattern: position 3? We need I at pos3? ""TASTE"" has S at pos3? Not matching.

Wait, we must have I at position 3 → so the word must be: letter1, letter2, I, letter4, E.

And letter2 must be S? So: ? S I ? E

Known words: 
- ""USIAE"" not word.
- ""MASTI"" ends with I? No.

How about ""POSIE""? But O and P are bad? Wait, we have ""poise"" already.

Another one: ""DEVIE""? Not valid.

Perhaps I cannot find any word where S is at position 2? Maybe it's not common.

In English, common words ending with ""IE"" have S at the beginning? Let me think.

With pattern: _ _ I _ E, and S in the word at 1 or 2.

If S is at 2: then the form is ? S I ? E

Examples of valid words:
- ""ASSISI"" too long.
- ""CIVIE"" doesn't have S.
- ""COSIE"" O is bad.

Perhaps ""BUSBY"" doesn't end with E.

It might be that S at position 2 is rare. 

So possibly S is at position 1.

Therefore, let's focus on S at position 1: S ? I ? E

Examples:
- ""SMILE"": S M I L E
- ""SLITE"" (not common) → S L I T E
- ""SAICE"" but A is bad → invalid.
- ""SUITE"": S U I T E → but then the pattern: S U I T E → but we have I at position 3 and E at position 5, good. And S at position 1.

""SUITE"" is S, U, I, T, E → which has U and T.

But in ""poise"", we had S at position 4 and got ""-"", meaning S is in the word but not at 4. In ""SUITE"", S is at 1, so that's okay.

But note: in ""SUITE"", we have T at position 4. And U at position 2.

We haven't tested U or T.

So ""SUITE"" is a candidate.

Also, ""SHITE"" is vulgar and we should avoid? Not appropriate.

Also, ""SKITE"" may not be well known.

So good candidates: ""SMILE"" and ""SUITE"".

We also have: ""QUITE"" → Q U I T E, but Q is less common.

But ""SUITE"" and ""SMILE"" are good.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test more letters.

In ""SMILE"", we test M and L.
In ""SUITE"", we test U and T.

We haven't tested either set.

But note: we know position 4 in the secret word is open. We need to guess a word that will narrow down the possibilities.

If we guess ""SMILE"", we will test M in position 2 and L in position 4.

If we guess ""SUITE"", we test U in position 2 and T in position 4.

Both seem acceptable.

But note: ""poise"" had S in the 4th position and we got S(-), meaning S is not at 4. If we guess ""SUITE"", S is at 1, so if S is indeed at 1 in the secret word, we would get S(✓) if it's correct? Wait, but we don't know if S is at 1 or 2.

Actually, ""SUITE"" has S at 1, so if the secret word has S at 1, we will see S(✓) in the feedback for position 1.

Similarly, if we guess ""SMILE"" and S is at 1, we get S(✓).

But note, regardless, we are testing S at position 1 explicitly.

If we get S(✓), then we know S is at position 1.

If we get S(-), that would mean S is in the word but not at 1? But that cannot be because if S is not at 1, then it must be at 2 (since positions 3,4,5 are either I,4th unknown, E).

But if S is at 2, and we put it at 1, then we get S(-) meaning it's in the word but wrong position, so S must be at position 2.

Therefore, by guessing a word that has S at position 1, we can determine whether S is at 1 or 2.

We need to do this because we don't know S's position.

Therefore, we should design our next guess to have S at position 1 to test position 1.

Because in the wild, S could be in 1 or 2.

So picking a word with S at position 1 will tell us:

- If S(✓), then position 1 is S.
- If S(-), then position 1 must be something else, and S must be at position 2.

Therefore, we should choose a word that has S at position 1 and other new letters.

For example: ""SUITE"" or ""SMILE"".

Both are valid.

Let us choose ""SUITE"" because it uses U and T, which are common consonants and vowels, respectively.

""SUITE"": S at 1, U at 2, I at 3, T at 4, E at 5.

We know I (3) and E (5) will be ✓, so we get info on U and T.

If ""SUITE"" is the word, we win.

Otherwise, feedback will tell us about U and T.

We might also consider ""SHINE"", but N is bad → invalid.

So ""SUITE"" seems good.

But let me confirm: in ""SUITE"", position 4 is T, which we don't know.

And we avoid bad letters: C,R,A,N,P,O.

Yes, U and T are not forbidden.

Similarly, ""SMILE"" has M and L.

But why ""SUITE"" over ""SMILE""? Not a strong reason. Both would work.

But note: position 4 in the secret word might be T or not, etc.

I think ""SUITE"" is a common word.

So I will go with ""SUITE"".

Therefore, third guess: ""SUITE""

In the response, we will return that.Based on the feedback:
- **First guess ""crane""**: E is confirmed in the correct 5th position (✓), and C, R, A, N are absent (x).
- **Second guess ""poise""**: I is confirmed in the correct 3rd position (✓), E is confirmed again in the 5th position (✓), S is present but not in the 4th position (-), and P and O are absent (x). 

### Key deductions:
- **Pattern**: The secret word must match the pattern `_  _  I  _  E`.
- **S position**: Since S is in the word but not in position 4 (from ""poise"" feedback), and positions 3 (I) and 5 (E) are fixed, S must be in position 1 or 2.
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N (from ""crane""), P, O (from ""poise"") are not in the word. Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- **Strategy**: Focus on:
  - Testing the position of S (i.e., is it in position 1 or 2?).
  - Using new, common letters to gain more information.
  - Avoiding the known absent letters.

### Optimal next guess: ""SUITE""
- **Why ""SUITE""?**
  - **Pattern match**: SUITE → S (pos1), U (pos2), I (pos3), T (pos4), E (pos5). This fits `_ _ I _ E`, with I and E in their confirmed positions.
  - **Tests S position**: By placing S in position 1, the feedback will pinpoint S's location:
    - If S is ✓, S is in position 1.
    - If S is -, S must be in position 2 (since it cannot be in position 3, 4, or 5).
  - **U and T**: Tests new letters (U and T) that are common vowels/consonants and haven't been tried yet.
  - **Avoids absent letters**: No C, R, A, N, P, or O.
  - **Word validity**: ""SUITE"" is a valid 5-letter English word (meaning a set of rooms or a musical composition).

### Expected outcomes:
- The feedback will clarify:
  - The exact position of S.
  - Whether U and T are present and their positions.
- This narrows possibilities efficiently for the next guess.

<guess>suite</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: poise -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(✓) S(-) E(✓)
Guess 3: suite -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) U(x) I(✓) T(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given the following feedback:

Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).
- C, R, A, N are not in the word.

Guess 2: poise -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(✓) S(-) E(✓)
- I is in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter). 
- E is in the correct position (5th letter).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (guessed in 4th, so it cannot be in 4th).
- P and O are not in the word.

Guess 3: suite -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) U(x) I(✓) T(x) E(✓)
- S is in the word and in the correct position (1st letter).
- U is not in the word.
- I is in the correct position (3rd letter).
- T is not in the word.
- E is in the correct position (5th letter).

From this, we know the secret word has the pattern: S _ I _ E 
- The first letter is S, third is I, fifth is E.
- The word does not contain: C, R, A, N, P, O, U, T (from absent letters in guesses).
- S is in position 1, so the previous feedback from ""poise"" that S is present but not in position 4 is consistent.

We are missing letters in positions 2 and 4.

Let's list the absent letters: C, R, A, N, P, O, U, T.

So, available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Since the word is S _ I _ E, we know:
- Position 2: must be one of the available letters.
- Position 4: must be one of the available letters.

The word must be a valid English word.

Possible words: We need to find 5-letter words starting with S, third letter I, fifth letter E, and the second and fourth letters from the available set.

Common words that fit:
- SHIRE: But R is absent (from guess1) and E is the last letter. Also, H might be possible? But R is forbidden -> invalid.
- SLICE: But L and C? C is absent -> invalid.
- SHINE: H and N? N absent -> invalid.
- SMILE: M and L -> both available? Let's check: M not absent, L not absent, and E at end. So ""smile"" is S M I L E -> positions: S(1), M(2), I(3), L(4), E(5). Available letters include M and L.

Is ""smile"" a valid word? Yes.

Other options:
- SPITE: P absent -> invalid.
- SLIME: S L I M E -> L and M are available. So ""slime"".
- SHITE: vulgar, avoid? Also H might be tested.
- SMILE and SLIME are both possible.

But are there more?
- SHIVE: H and V -> possible? ""shive"" means a thin slice or a splinter. But let's see pattern: S H I V E -> H in position 2, V in position 4.
- SKIVE: S K I V E -> K and V.
- STILE: T absent -> invalid (T not allowed).
- SWIVE: S W I V E -> W and V.

But we have missed one: We already know U is absent, so we can use others.

To maximize information, we want to test letters that are common and haven't been tried.

We haven't used H, L, M, K, etc.

Since we have a pattern, we can guess a word that might be the solution.

Given we know S,I,E and missing only two letters.

We have 4 tries left? Actually, we are at guess 3, so we have 3 more guesses after this.

We can try ""smile"" to test M and L.

If ""smile"" is correct, we win. Otherwise, we get feedback.

Similarly, we can try ""slice"", but C absent -> not possible.

Let me list all possible words with pattern S?I?E and no forbidden letters.

Allowable letters for position 2 and 4: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common words:
- SMILE: M and L -> S M I L E
- SLIME: L and M -> S L I M E
- SHINE: H and N -> N absent -> invalid
- SHIRE: H and R -> R absent -> invalid
- SKIVE: K and V -> S K I V E
- SHIVE: H and V -> S H I V E
- SPINE: P absent -> invalid
- SUITE: already guessed? But U absent -> not the word.

Also: ""SMIKE"" not common? 
- ""SHITE"" not appropriate.

Another: ""SWIPE"": P and W -> P absent -> invalid.

""SNIDE"": N absent -> invalid.

""SPIKE"": P absent -> invalid.

""STIME"" not common.

So plausible common words: SMILE, SLIME, SKIVE, SHIVE, etc.

To choose between them, we can guess a word that uses common letters.

We can also consider ""SMILE"" because it is common.

We might also use a word that tests H, etc.

But let me note: in our history, we haven't tested M, L, H, V, etc.

Therefore, ""SMILE"" would test M and L: 
- Position 2: M
- Position 4: L

If correct, we win.

If not, we get feedback.

Similarly, if we guess ""SHIVE"", we test H and V.

Which is better? We don't know.

But M and L are very common, so ""SMILE"" is a good choice.

Alternatively, we can avoid repeating letters? But SMILE has distinct letters.

But note: the secret word might have repeated letters? Possible, but we have no indication so far.

But in this case, positions 2 and 4 are different letters.

Now, if we guess ""SMILE"" and it's wrong, the feedback will tell us:
- If M is correct, absent, or wrong spot? Since M is at position 2.
- Similarly for L at position 4.

But we don't know if either is in the word.

Another candidate: ""SHIMY"" doesn't end with E? Not.

So, I think ""SMILE"" is the way to go.

We can also consider ""SWIPE"" but P absent -> invalid.

So, our third guess was ""SUITE"", and now fourth guess I propose ""SMILE"".

But note: if the secret word were ""smile"", we would have known that S is in the word from guess2, but guess2 had S in position 4 which is its wrong spot? No, the word has S at position 1, so in guess2, S was in position 4 and got ""-"" meaning that it is present but not at position 4, which is consistent.

Also, in the secret word, the S at position 1 would have been detected.

So, no conflict.

Therefore, I choose ""SMILE"" for the fourth guess.

So the word is ""SMILE"".Based on the feedback:
- **Pattern locked**: The secret word is confirmed as `S _ I _ E` (S in position 1, I in position 3, E in position 5).
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N (from guess 1), P, O (from guess 2), U, T (from guess 3). So absent: C, R, A, N, P, O, U, T.
- **Present letters**: S (position 1), I (position 3), E (position 5), and S is already placed.  
- **Unknown positions**: Letter 2 and letter 4 must be from the remaining available letters (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z).

### Strategy for next guess:
- Focus on testing **common letters** for positions 2 and 4 (e.g., H, L, M, D, G) to narrow down possibilities.
- Avoid repeating known absent letters or confirmed letter positions.  
- Prioritize words with high-likelihood letters (e.g., L, M, H) to maximize information gain.  

### Optimal guess: ""SMILE""
- **Why ""SMILE""?**
  - Tests ""M"" in position 2 and ""L"" in position 4—both common, untested letters.
  - Fits the pattern `S _ I _ E` (S✓, M?, I✓, L?, E✓).
  - If correct, solves the puzzle. If incorrect, feedback will reveal:
    - Whether M or L is present/absent.
    - Whether M is correctly placed (position 2) or L is correctly placed (position 4).
  - Uses no absent letters (M and L are available).

Alternatives like ""SHINE"" (invalid due to absent N) or ""SLICE"" (invalid due to absent C) were rejected. ""SMILE"" is a valid common word.

We should avoid using the letters C, R, A, N (since they are not in the word) and we know E is in the word and must be in the last position.\n\nWe also note that the word does not have any of the letters C, R, A, N. So we must choose a word that:\n- Has E in the 5th position (because we know it\'s correct there)\n- Uses other letters that are common and not in the set {C, R, A, N}\n\nWe can consider words that end with E and use other vowels and common consonants.\n\nPossible letters to use: We have 26 letters minus C, R, A, N, and we know E is fixed at the end.\n\nWe have 4 positions to fill (positions 1 to 4) and we must avoid C, R, A, N.\n\nWe also want to test new letters to get more information.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we also know that the word must be a valid English word.\n\nGood candidates: We can try a word that has a lot of common consonants and vowels that we haven\'t tested.\n\nLet\'s think of words ending with E that don\'t contain C, R, A, N.\n\nExamples: \n- ""SLATE"" -> but S, L, T are new, but we know A is not in the word? Wait, feedback said A is not in the word, so we cannot use A. Similarly, we cannot use C, R, N.\n\nSo we must avoid A, C, R, N.\n\nLet\'s try to think of words ending in E without A, C, R, N.\n\nSome ideas:\n- ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> but O and L are new, and we avoid A, C, R, N. So this is acceptable.\n- ""SPIKE"": S, P, I, K, E -> also acceptable.\n- ""STYLE"": S, T, Y, L, E -> acceptable.\n\nBut we also want to cover vowels. We haven\'t tested O, I, U, etc.\n\nSince we know the last letter is E, we can focus on the first four.\n\nWe might also consider that the word has E and we know it\'s at the end, so we can test other vowels in the first four positions.\n\nLet me list a few words that end with E and don\'t have A, C, R, N:\n- ""BIKE"" -> but that\'s 4 letters, we need 5. So 5-letter words.\n- ""BIBLE"" -> has B, I, B, L, E -> but B repeats? We don\'t know if repetition is allowed, but the secret word might have repeated letters? However, the feedback doesn\'t indicate that, so we avoid repetition for now to maximize information.\n\nActually, the rules don\'t say the word can\'t have repeated letters, but in the example, there were no repeats. So it\'s possible, but for a second guess, we might avoid repeats.\n\nLet me think of words without repeated letters and without A, C, R, N, and ending with E.\n\nSome options:\n1. ""STOLE"" -> letters: S, T, O, L, E\n2. ""SPIKE"" -> S, P, I, K, E\n3. ""STYLE"" -> S, T, Y, L, E\n4. ""PHONE"" -> P, H, O, N, E -> but N is not allowed? Feedback said N is not in the word, so we cannot use N. So ""PHONE"" is invalid because of N.\n5. ""MOUSE"" -> M, O, U, S, E -> U is a vowel we haven\'t tested.\n\nWe can also consider ""HOUSE"", but H, O, U, S, E.\n\nBut let\'s choose one that tests more common letters.\n\nI think ""STOLE"" is a good candidate because it has S, T, O, L which are common.\n\nAlternatively, ""SPIKE"" tests P, I, K which are also common.\n\nBut note: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to test.\n\nAnother idea: since we know E is at the end, we can try to test other common vowels in the first positions.\n\nFor example, we haven\'t tested I, O, U.\n\nWe can try a word that has I and O and other new consonants.\n\nBut we have to avoid A, C, R, N.\n\nLet me try to find a word that has I and O and ends with E, without A, C, R, N.\n\nExample: ""VOICE"" -> V, O, I, C, E -> but C is not allowed (we know C is not in the word). So invalid.\n\n""POISE"" -> P, O, I, S, E -> this works: no A, C, R, N.\n\nSimilarly, ""NOISE"" -> but N is not allowed.\n\nSo ""POISE"" is acceptable: P, O, I, S, E.\n\nWe can also consider ""QUITE"" -> Q, U, I, T, E -> but Q is less common, and we might not want to use it.\n\nAnother one: ""MOIST"" -> but doesn\'t end with E? We need E at the end.\n\nSo we must have E at the end.\n\nTherefore, ""POISE"" is a good candidate: it tests P, O, I, S, and E (which we know is at the end).\n\nBut note: in ""POISE"", the E is at the end, so that\'s fixed.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""HOUSE"": H, O, U, S, E -> tests H, O, U, S.\n\nI think both are good.\n\nBut let\'s see which one covers more common letters.\n\nWe have to consider that the secret word might have S, T, L, etc.\n\nI think ""STOLE"" is a solid choice because it tests S, T, O, L.\n\nWe can also consider ""SLIME"": S, L, I, M, E -> tests M and I.\n\nBut let\'s go with ""STOLE"" for now.\n\nHowever, note that in the first guess, we had E at the end, and now we are putting E at the end again, which is fine because we know it\'s correct.\n\nBut we are not getting new information about E, but that\'s okay because we are using that known position to test other letters.\n\nSo I will go with ""STOLE"".\n\nBut let me check if ""STOLE"" is a valid word: yes, it means to take something without permission.\n\nAlternatively, we can use ""SPILE"" but that might be less common.\n\nI think ""STOLE"" is better.\n\nBut wait, we have the letter O. We don\'t know if O is in the word.\n\nAnother candidate: ""SUITE"" -> S, U, I, T, E -> tests U and I.\n\nBut I think ""STOLE"" is fine.\n\nWe can also consider ""SHIRE"" but that has R? We know R is not in the word (from first feedback: R was x). So we cannot use R.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid R.\n\nSo ""STOLE"" does not have R, so it\'s okay.\n\nSimilarly, ""POISE"" is also okay.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""POISE"" because it tests three vowels: O and I, and also P and S.\n\nBut ""POISE"" has O, I, and S.\n\nAlternatively, ""HOUSE"" has O, U, and S.\n\nBut U is less common than I? Not necessarily.\n\nWe can choose either.\n\nLet me pick ""POISE"" because it has two new vowels (O and I) and two consonants (P and S).\n\nSo second guess: ""POISE""\n\nBut note: in ""POISE"", the E is at the end, which we know is correct.\n\nSo we are testing the first four letters: P, O, I, S.\n\nIf we get feedback, we can know about these letters.\n\nTherefore, I will guess ""POISE"".\n\nBut let me confirm: the word is ""POISE"", which is a valid English word meaning composure.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the guess is ""POISE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, A, and N are not in the secret word (all marked as ""x"").\n- E is in the secret word and in the correct position (5th letter, marked as ""✓"").\n\nTherefore, the secret word ends with ""E"" and does not contain C, R, A, or N. For the second guess:\n- The word must end with ""E"" to confirm or build on the known position.\n- Avoid using C, R, A, or N to focus on new letters.\n- Prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, O, I, P, L) to maximize information gain.\n\nA strong second guess is ""POISE"" because:\n- It ends with ""E"", leveraging the known correct position.\n- It tests new common letters: P, O, I, S.\n- It avoids C, R, A, and N.\n- As a valid English word, it provides broad coverage of vowels (O, I) and consonants (P, S).\n\nThis guess will help identify if any of P, O, I, or S are in the word and their positions, narrowing down possibilities for subsequent guesses.\n\n<guess>poise</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: poise -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(✓) S(-) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given:\n- For ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓) → so E is in the word and in the correct position (5th), and C, R, A, N are not in the word.\n- For ""poise"": P(x), O(x), I(✓), S(-), E(✓) → \n  - I(✓) means I is in the word and in the correct position, which is the 3rd letter (since ""poise"" is P-O-I-S-E).\n  - S(-) means S is in the word but in the wrong position. Since our guess had S in the 4th position, the actual word has S somewhere else.\n  - P(x) and O(x) mean P and O are not in the word.\n  - E(✓) confirms E is still in the 5th position.\n\nSo, we know:\n- The secret word has 5 letters: _ _ _ _ E\n- The 3rd letter is I → so pattern: _ _ I _ E\n- The word contains S, but not in the 4th position (because in ""poise"", S was in 4th and got ""-"" meaning it\'s present but wrong spot). So S must be in position 1, 2, or possibly 5? But position 5 is E, so S is in 1st or 2nd.\n- Letters not in the word: C, R, A, N, P, O (from both guesses).\n- Also, we have used: C,R,A,N,E,P,O,I,S. So avoided letters: C, R, A, N, P, O.\n\nNow, we need to guess a word that fits:\n- Must have pattern: _ _ I _ E\n- Must contain S, and S must be in either position 1 or 2 (since it can\'t be in 3rd which is I or 4th which was wrong in guess2, or 5th which is E). So S is in 1st or 2nd.\n- We know the word has I (3rd) and E (5th) and S (somewhere).\n\nAlso, we must avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, N, P, O.\n\nLet\'s summarize the known:\n- Position 3: I\n- Position 5: E\n- S is in the word, and must be in position 1 or 2.\n\nNow, for the word: positions:\n1: must be S or some other letter (but S must appear, so if not at 1, then at 2)\n2: if S is not at 1, then must be at 2.\n\nBut note, S might be at position 1 and then we can have another letter at 2, or vice versa.\n\nLet\'s think of possible words that have the form _ _ I _ E, contain S, and avoid C,R,A,N,P,O.\n\nWe need to choose a word that uses new letters to test, because we only know a few letters so far.\n\nWe know S, I, E are in the word, and I and E are fixed.\n\nThe missing letters are for positions 1, 2, and 4.\n\nPosition 4 is the only one without any info except it can\'t be S (because if S were in position 4, guess2 would have shown it as correct? But in guess2, S was in position 4 and got ""-"", meaning it\'s not fixed there).\n\nSo we are free to choose letters for positions 1, 2, 4, with constraints:\n- The word must have S in position 1 or 2.\n- The remaining positions (1 or 2 and 4) can be any other letters from the alphabet except C, R, A, N, P, O.\n- And the word must be valid English.\n\nWe also have only 4 tries left (since we are on guess 3).\n\nLet\'s list some possible words that fit: _ _ I _ E\n\nAnd contain S.\n\nCase 1: S at position 1 → words starting with ""SI?E"" → S X I Y E, where X and Y are letters not in the bad set.\n\nCase 2: S at position 2 → words like X S I Y E.\n\nThen, we must avoid C,R,A,N,P,O.\n\nWe also haven\'t tested many letters: for example, we have used C,R,A,N,E,P,O,I,S. So available: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nBut we must form a valid word.\n\nLet\'s brainstorm examples:\n\nCase 1: S at position 1 → ""S""? I _ E\nExamples:\n- ""SMILE"" → S M I L E → positions: S(1), M(2), I(3), L(4), E(5). But L is new and M is new. And avoids bad letters.\n- ""SHINE"" → S H I N E → but N is bad? We know N is not in the word (from first guess: N(x)). And also, in ""SHINE"", N is at position 4, but N is forbidden. So invalid.\n- ""SKITE""? Not common.\n- ""SPITE"" → but P is bad? P was used and got x, so P not in word → invalid.\nSo ""SMILE"" is a candidate.\n\nCase 2: S at position 2 → _ S I _ E\nExamples:\n- ""USILE"" not valid.\n- ""ASIDE"" → but A is bad → invalid.\n- ""FSIZE"" not word.\n- ""MSIZE"" not word.\n- ""TWISE"" not common.\n- ""SWIPE"" → S W I P E → but P is bad → invalid.\n- ""SUITE"" → S U I T E → but here S is at position 2? Wait: positions: 1:? Let me see: if S at position 2, then it\'s X S I Y E.\n\nFor ""SUITE"": would be U S I T E? But ""suite"" is S-U-I-T-E? Oh, no, ""suite"" starts with S. Wait, if S is at position 2, then the word must be like X S I Y E.\n\n""AXIS"" ends with S? We need E at the end.\n\nPossible words: \n- ""ELSIE""? But that\'s E at start → word ""ELSIE"" is E-L-S-I-E → positions: E(1), L(2), S(3), I(4), E(5). But wait, we need I at position 3 and E at 5? Here E is at 1 and 5, I at 4? Not matching pattern.\n\nActually, we have pattern: position 3 must be I, 5 must be E.\n\nSo for S at pos2: _ S I _ E\n\nExamples:\n- ""USINE"" not valid.\n- ""TOWIE"" not word? \n- ""BASIE?"" B A S I E → but A is bad → invalid.\n\nAnother word: ""SHIRE"" → S H I R E → but R is bad → invalid.\n\n""WHITE"" → W H I T E → but does not have S? We must have S in the word → ""WHITE"" has no S.\n\nWe need the word to contain S.\n\nSo for position 2 being S: words like X S I Y E.\n\nValid English words: \n- ""ASSIE"" not proper.\n- ""ESSIE""? Not common.\n- ""dassie"" → D A S S I E → too long? But 5 letter: DASSIE is 6? \n\nActually, 5-letter examples I can think of: \n- ""TSINE"" not common.\n- ""PSION"" doesn\'t end with E.\n\nPerhaps ""TASTE"" → T A S T E → but A is bad and pattern: position 3? We need I at pos3? ""TASTE"" has S at pos3? Not matching.\n\nWait, we must have I at position 3 → so the word must be: letter1, letter2, I, letter4, E.\n\nAnd letter2 must be S? So: ? S I ? E\n\nKnown words: \n- ""USIAE"" not word.\n- ""MASTI"" ends with I? No.\n\nHow about ""POSIE""? But O and P are bad? Wait, we have ""poise"" already.\n\nAnother one: ""DEVIE""? Not valid.\n\nPerhaps I cannot find any word where S is at position 2? Maybe it\'s not common.\n\nIn English, common words ending with ""IE"" have S at the beginning? Let me think.\n\nWith pattern: _ _ I _ E, and S in the word at 1 or 2.\n\nIf S is at 2: then the form is ? S I ? E\n\nExamples of valid words:\n- ""ASSISI"" too long.\n- ""CIVIE"" doesn\'t have S.\n- ""COSIE"" O is bad.\n\nPerhaps ""BUSBY"" doesn\'t end with E.\n\nIt might be that S at position 2 is rare. \n\nSo possibly S is at position 1.\n\nTherefore, let\'s focus on S at position 1: S ? I ? E\n\nExamples:\n- ""SMILE"": S M I L E\n- ""SLITE"" (not common) → S L I T E\n- ""SAICE"" but A is bad → invalid.\n- ""SUITE"": S U I T E → but then the pattern: S U I T E → but we have I at position 3 and E at position 5, good. And S at position 1.\n\n""SUITE"" is S, U, I, T, E → which has U and T.\n\nBut in ""poise"", we had S at position 4 and got ""-"", meaning S is in the word but not at 4. In ""SUITE"", S is at 1, so that\'s okay.\n\nBut note: in ""SUITE"", we have T at position 4. And U at position 2.\n\nWe haven\'t tested U or T.\n\nSo ""SUITE"" is a candidate.\n\nAlso, ""SHITE"" is vulgar and we should avoid? Not appropriate.\n\nAlso, ""SKITE"" may not be well known.\n\nSo good candidates: ""SMILE"" and ""SUITE"".\n\nWe also have: ""QUITE"" → Q U I T E, but Q is less common.\n\nBut ""SUITE"" and ""SMILE"" are good.\n\nNow, which one to choose? We want to test more letters.\n\nIn ""SMILE"", we test M and L.\nIn ""SUITE"", we test U and T.\n\nWe haven\'t tested either set.\n\nBut note: we know position 4 in the secret word is open. We need to guess a word that will narrow down the possibilities.\n\nIf we guess ""SMILE"", we will test M in position 2 and L in position 4.\n\nIf we guess ""SUITE"", we test U in position 2 and T in position 4.\n\nBoth seem acceptable.\n\nBut note: ""poise"" had S in the 4th position and we got S(-), meaning S is not at 4. If we guess ""SUITE"", S is at 1, so if S is indeed at 1 in the secret word, we would get S(✓) if it\'s correct? Wait, but we don\'t know if S is at 1 or 2.\n\nActually, ""SUITE"" has S at 1, so if the secret word has S at 1, we will see S(✓) in the feedback for position 1.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess ""SMILE"" and S is at 1, we get S(✓).\n\nBut note, regardless, we are testing S at position 1 explicitly.\n\nIf we get S(✓), then we know S is at position 1.\n\nIf we get S(-), that would mean S is in the word but not at 1? But that cannot be because if S is not at 1, then it must be at 2 (since positions 3,4,5 are either I,4th unknown, E).\n\nBut if S is at 2, and we put it at 1, then we get S(-) meaning it\'s in the word but wrong position, so S must be at position 2.\n\nTherefore, by guessing a word that has S at position 1, we can determine whether S is at 1 or 2.\n\nWe need to do this because we don\'t know S\'s position.\n\nTherefore, we should design our next guess to have S at position 1 to test position 1.\n\nBecause in the wild, S could be in 1 or 2.\n\nSo picking a word with S at position 1 will tell us:\n\n- If S(✓), then position 1 is S.\n- If S(-), then position 1 must be something else, and S must be at position 2.\n\nTherefore, we should choose a word that has S at position 1 and other new letters.\n\nFor example: ""SUITE"" or ""SMILE"".\n\nBoth are valid.\n\nLet us choose ""SUITE"" because it uses U and T, which are common consonants and vowels, respectively.\n\n""SUITE"": S at 1, U at 2, I at 3, T at 4, E at 5.\n\nWe know I (3) and E (5) will be ✓, so we get info on U and T.\n\nIf ""SUITE"" is the word, we win.\n\nOtherwise, feedback will tell us about U and T.\n\nWe might also consider ""SHINE"", but N is bad → invalid.\n\nSo ""SUITE"" seems good.\n\nBut let me confirm: in ""SUITE"", position 4 is T, which we don\'t know.\n\nAnd we avoid bad letters: C,R,A,N,P,O.\n\nYes, U and T are not forbidden.\n\nSimilarly, ""SMILE"" has M and L.\n\nBut why ""SUITE"" over ""SMILE""?

This fits `_ _ I _ E`, with I and E in their confirmed positions.\n  - **Tests S position**: By placing S in position 1, the feedback will pinpoint S\'s location:\n    - If S is ✓, S is in position 1.\n    - If S is -, S must be in position 2 (since it cannot be in position 3, 4, or 5).\n  - **U and T**: Tests new letters (U and T) that are common vowels/consonants and haven\'t been tried yet.\n  - **Avoids absent letters**: No C, R, A, N, P, or O.\n  - **Word validity**: ""SUITE"" is a valid 5-letter English word (meaning a set of rooms or a musical composition).\n\n### Expected outcomes:\n- The feedback will clarify:\n  - The exact position of S.\n  - Whether U and T are present and their positions.\n- This narrows possibilities efficiently for the next guess.\n\n<guess>suite</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: poise -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(✓) S(-) E(✓)\nGuess 3: suite -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) U(x) I(✓) T(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given the following feedback:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\n- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).\n- C, R, A, N are not in the word.\n\nGuess 2: poise -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(✓) S(-) E(✓)\n- I is in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter). \n- E is in the correct position (5th letter).\n- S is in the word but in the wrong position (guessed in 4th, so it cannot be in 4th).\n- P and O are not in the word.\n\nGuess 3: suite -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) U(x) I(✓) T(x) E(✓)\n- S is in the word and in the correct position (1st letter).\n- U is not in the word.\n- I is in the correct position (3rd letter).\n- T is not in the word.\n- E is in the correct position (5th letter).\n\nFrom this, we know the secret word has the pattern: S _ I _ E \n- The first letter is S, third is I, fifth is E.\n- The word does not contain: C, R, A, N, P, O, U, T (from absent letters in guesses).\n- S is in position 1, so the previous feedback from ""poise"" that S is present but not in position 4 is consistent.\n\nWe are missing letters in positions 2 and 4.\n\nLet\'s list the absent letters: C, R, A, N, P, O, U, T.\n\nSo, available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nSince the word is S _ I _ E, we know:\n- Position 2: must be one of the available letters.\n- Position 4: must be one of the available letters.\n\nThe word must be a valid English word.\n\nPossible words: We need to find 5-letter words starting with S, third letter I, fifth letter E, and the second and fourth letters from the available set.\n\nCommon words that fit:\n- SHIRE: But R is absent (from guess1) and E is the last letter.

We don\'t know.\n\nBut M and L are very common, so ""SMILE"" is a good choice.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid repeating letters? But SMILE has distinct letters.\n\nBut note: the secret word might have repeated letters? Possible, but we have no indication so far.\n\nBut in this case, positions 2 and 4 are different letters.\n\nNow, if we guess ""SMILE"" and it\'s wrong, the feedback will tell us:\n- If M is correct, absent, or wrong spot? Since M is at position 2.\n- Similarly for L at position 4.\n\nBut we don\'t know if either is in the word.\n\nAnother candidate: ""SHIMY"" doesn\'t end with E? Not.\n\nSo, I think ""SMILE"" is the way to go.\n\nWe can also consider ""SWIPE"" but P absent -> invalid.\n\nSo, our third guess was ""SUITE"", and now fourth guess I propose ""SMILE"".\n\nBut note: if the secret word were ""smile"", we would have known that S is in the word from guess2, but guess2 had S in position 4 which is its wrong spot? No, the word has S at position 1, so in guess2, S was in position 4 and got ""-"" meaning that it is present but not at position 4, which is consistent.\n\nAlso, in the secret word, the S at position 1 would have been detected.\n\nSo, no conflict.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""SMILE"" for the fourth guess.\n\nSo the word is ""SMILE"".Based on the feedback:\n- **Pattern locked**: The secret word is confirmed as `S _ I _ E` (S in position 1, I in position 3, E in position 5).\n- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N (from guess 1), P, O (from guess 2), U, T (from guess 3). So absent: C, R, A, N, P, O, U, T.\n- **Present letters**: S (position 1), I (position 3), E (position 5), and S is already placed.  \n- **Unknown positions**: Letter 2 and letter 4 must be from the remaining available letters (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z).\n\n### Strategy for next guess:\n- Focus on testing **common letters** for positions 2 and 4 (e.g., H, L, M, D, G) to narrow down possibilities.\n- Avoid repeating known absent letters or confirmed letter positions.  \n- Prioritize words with high-likelihood letters (e.g., L, M, H) to maximize information gain.  \n\n### Optimal guess: ""SMILE""\n- **Why ""SMILE""?**\n  - Tests ""M"" in position 2 and ""L"" in position 4—both common, untested letters.\n  - Fits the pattern `S _ I _ E` (S✓, M?, I✓, L?, E✓).\n  - If correct, solves the puzzle. If incorrect, feedback will reveal:\n    - Whether M or L is present/absent.\n    - Whether M is correctly placed (position 2) or L is correctly placed (position 4).\n  - Uses no absent letters (M and L are available).\n\nAlternatives like ""SHINE"" (invalid due to absent N) or ""SLICE"" (invalid due to absent C) were rejected.

We are given the feedback for the fourth guess ""smile"":
- S(✓): Correct position (1st letter)
- M(x): M is not in the word
- I(✓): Correct position (3rd letter)
- L(-): L is in the word but in the wrong position (since it was guessed in position 4, but it's not there)
- E(✓): Correct position (5th letter)

So, from this, we know:
- The word is S _ I _ E
- M is not in the word (so we can eliminate M)
- L is in the word, but not in position 4. Since the word is S _ I _ E, the only positions for L are 2 or ... but position 1 is S, 3 is I, 5 is E, so L must be in position 2? Because position 4 is the only other possibility? Wait, no: the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. We know:
  - Position 1: S
  - Position 3: I
  - Position 5: E
  - Position 2 and 4 are unknown.

But L is in the word and not in position 4 (because we put it there and got ""-"", meaning it's present but not in that position). Therefore, L must be in position 2? Because that's the only position left? But wait, we have two positions: 2 and 4. We know L is not in 4, so it must be in position 2.

But is that necessarily true? The word has five letters, and we know three of them: S, I, E at 1,3,5. The other two positions are 2 and 4. We have L in the word, and it's not at position 4, so it must be at position 2.

Therefore, the word must be: S L I ? E? But wait, we have L at position 2? But we don't know that for sure yet. We know L is in the word and not at position 4, and the only other available position is 2 (since 1,3,5 are taken by S,I,E). So yes, L must be at position 2.

But let me confirm: the word has exactly five letters. We know S at 1, I at 3, E at 5. The remaining positions are 2 and 4. We know the word contains L, and it cannot be at position 4 (because we tried and it was wrong position). Therefore, it must be at position 2.

So, the word is: S L I ? E

But we don't know the letter at position 4.

Also, we have feedback that M is not in the word.

Now, we also have the list of absent letters from previous guesses: C, R, A, N, P, O, U, T, and now M.

So absent letters: C, R, A, N, P, O, U, T, M.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to find a word that is S L I ? E, with the ? being one of the available letters.

So the pattern is ""SLI?E"".

Now, what are possible words?

Common words:
- ""SLICE"": but C is absent -> invalid.
- ""SLIME"": but M is absent -> invalid (we just learned M is absent).
- ""SLIDE"": D is available? Let's check: D is not in the absent list -> available. So ""SLIDE"" is S L I D E.
- ""SLIPE"": P is absent -> invalid.
- ""SLIVE"": not common? But let's see: S L I V E -> V is available.
- ""SLIKE"": not common.
- ""SLIDE"" and ""SLIVE"" are possibilities.

Also, ""SLIDE"" is a common word.

Another one: ""SLATE"" -> but A and T are absent -> invalid.

""SLIDE"" seems the most common.

But let me list all possible:

- B: ""SLIBE""? Not a word.
- D: ""SLIDE"" -> valid.
- F: ""SLIFE""? Not common.
- G: ""SLIGE""? Not common.
- H: ""SLIHE""? Not a word.
- J: ""SLIJE""? No.
- K: ""SLIKE""? Not common.
- Q: ""SLIQE""? No.
- V: ""SLIVE""? Not common, but it might be a word (archaic for to slip or slide).
- W: ""SLIWE""? No.
- X: ""SLIXE""? No.
- Y: ""SLIYE""? No.
- Z: ""SLIZE""? Not common.

So the only common word is ""SLIDE"".

Therefore, the secret word is likely ""SLIDE"".

But we have to confirm: is ""SLIVE"" a word? It might be, but ""SLIDE"" is more common.

In the context of Wordle, we should go with the most common word.

Moreover, we have not used D yet, and it's available.

So we can guess ""SLIDE"" for the fifth guess.

But note: we have to make sure that L is at position 2. We deduced that L must be at position 2 because it's in the word and not at 4, and the only other position is 2.

But is it possible that the word has two L's? For example, could it be ""S L I L E""? But that would be ""SLILE"", which is not a word. And also, in our guess ""smile"", we had L at position 4 and got L(-), meaning L is present but not at 4. If the word had L at position 2 and another L at position 4, then when we put L at position 4, it should have been correct? But we got ""-"", meaning it's not at 4. So if there were two L's, one at 2 and one at 4, then when we put L at 4, it should be correct. But we got ""-"", which means that L is not at position 4, so there cannot be an L at position 4. Therefore, the word has exactly one L, and it must be at position 2.

Therefore, the word is ""S L I ? E"", and the only common word is ""SLIDE"".

So we should guess ""SLIDE"".

But to be thorough, let's see if there are other words.

""SLIPE"" is invalid because P is absent.

""SLIME"" is invalid because M is absent.

""SLIDE"" is the only common word.

Therefore, fifth guess: ""SLIDE""

We expect it to be correct.

Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, the secret word pattern is confirmed as **S _ I _ E**, with the following constraints:

### Key Insights:
1. **Fixed Positions**:
   - Position 1: **S** (✓ from guess 3 and 4).
   - Position 3: **I** (✓ from guess 2, 3, and 4).
   - Position 5: **E** (✓ from all guesses).
2. **Position 2**:
   - **L must be here** because:
     - L is in the word (L(-) in guess 4, meaning it is present but not in position 4).
     - The only possible positions for L are 2 or 4 (since positions 1, 3, and 5 are fixed).
     - L cannot be in position 4 (as confirmed by guess 4 feedback), so it must be in position 2.
3. **Position 4**:
   - Unknown letter, but must be one of the remaining available letters (see below).
4. **Absent Letters** (from all feedback):
   - C, R, A, N (guess 1), P, O (guess 2), U, T (guess 3), M (guess 4).  
   - **Available letters for position 4**: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
5. **Word Constraints**:
   - The word must be **S L I ? E** (since L is fixed at position 2).
   - Only common English words are valid.

### Analysis for Position 4:
- The only common English word fitting **S L I ? E** is **SLIDE** (D is available and not excluded).
- Other theoretical combinations (e.g., SLIKE, SLIVE, SLIFE) are not valid/common words.
- **SLIDE** is a high-probability solution given the constraints.

### Next Guess: ""SLIDE""
- Tests the deduced pattern **S L I D E**.
- If correct, it solves the puzzle. If incorrect, feedback will:
  - Confirm if D is present/absent.
  - Reveal if L is correctly placed at position 2 (expected ✓).
  - Provide new information to isolate the solution in the next guess (though unlikely, as ""SLIDE"" is the only common word).

<guess>slide</guess>",slide,"We are given the feedback for the fourth guess ""smile"":
- S(✓): Correct position (1st letter)
- M(x): M is not in the word
- I(✓): Correct position (3rd letter)
- L(-): L is in the word but in the wrong position (since it was guessed in position 4, but it's not there)
- E(✓): Correct position (5th letter)

- M is not in the word (so we can eliminate M)
- L is in the word, but not in position 4. Since the word is S _ I _ E, the only positions for L are 2 or ... but position 1 is S, 3 is I, 5 is E, so L must be in position 2? Because position 4 is the only other possibility? Wait, no: the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. We know:

  - Position 3: I
  - Position 5: E
  - Position 2 and 4 are unknown.

But L is in the word and not in position 4 (because we put it there and got ""-"", meaning it's present but not in that position). Therefore, L must be in position 2?

So, the word is: S L I ? E

But we don't know the letter at position 4.

Also, we have feedback that M is not in the word.

Now, we also have the list of absent letters from previous guesses: C, R, A, N, P, O, U, T, and now M.

So absent letters: C, R, A, N, P, O, U, T, M.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to find a word that is S L I ? E, with the ? being one of the available letters.

So the pattern is ""SLI?E"".

Now, what are possible words?

Common words:
- ""SLICE"": but C is absent -> invalid.

- ""SLIVE"": not common? But let's see: S L I V E -> V is available.
- ""SLIKE"": not common.
- ""SLIDE"" and ""SLIVE"" are possibilities.

Also, ""SLIDE"" is a common word.

Another one: ""SLATE"" -> but A and T are absent -> invalid.

""SLIDE"" seems the most common.

But let me list all possible:

- B: ""SLIBE""? Not a word.
- D: ""SLIDE"" -> valid.
- F: ""SLIFE""? Not common.
- G: ""SLIGE""? Not common.
- H: ""SLIHE""? Not a word.

- W: ""SLIWE""? No.

Therefore, the secret word is likely ""SLIDE"".

But we have to confirm: is ""SLIVE"" a word? It might be, but ""SLIDE"" is more common.

In the context of Wordle, we should go with the most common word.

Moreover, we have not used D yet, and it's available.

So we can guess ""SLIDE"" for the fifth guess.

But note: we have to make sure that L is at position 2. We deduced that L must be at position 2 because it's in the word and not at 4, and the only other position is 2.

But is it possible that the word has two L's? For example, could it be ""S L I L E""? But that would be ""SLILE"", which is not a word.
