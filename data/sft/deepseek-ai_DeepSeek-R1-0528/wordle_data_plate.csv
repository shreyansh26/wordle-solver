We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me think about the properties:
 - We want to cover as many common letters as possible.
 - The word should have 5 distinct letters to maximize information.

 Some common letters in English 5-letter words: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, etc.

 I recall that ""ROATE"" is a word (meaning a roll of money or something) and is often used by Wordle bots because it has common letters.
 However, let me check if ""ROATE"" is valid? Actually, I think ""ROATE"" might not be very common. Alternatively, ""CRANE"" is a good one.

 Another popular one is ""SLATE"". It has S, L, A, T, E. All common letters.

 Let me choose ""SLATE"" as the first guess. It has two vowels (A and E) and three consonants (S, L, T), which are all common.

 So, my first guess: SLATE

 But note: the problem says the word must be a valid 5-letter English word. ""SLATE"" is valid.

 Therefore, I will go with ""SLATE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""slate"":
 S(x) means 'S' is not in the secret word.
 L(✓) means 'L' is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
 A(✓) means 'A' is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
 T(✓) means 'T' is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
 E(✓) means 'E' is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

 So, from the feedback, we know:
 - The secret word has the letters L, A, T, E in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 respectively.
 - The letter S is not in the word.

 Therefore, the secret word is of the form: _ L A T E

 Now, we need to find a word that fits: [letter1] L A T E

 Known constraints:
 - The word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.
 - The first letter cannot be S (since S is not in the word).

 We have 6 tries, and this is the second guess.

 Our goal is to figure out the first letter.

 However, note: from the feedback, we only have one letter missing (the first one), and the rest are fixed: L in position 2, A in 3, T in 4, E in 5.

 So we need a word of the form: ? L A T E

 Let's think of common letters for the first position.

 Possible words: 
   plate, slate (but S is not allowed), late is 4 letters? So we need 5 letters.

 Some possibilities:
 - plate: P L A T E
 - flute: F L U T E -> but U and T? Wait, our fixed positions: L at 2, A at 3? In flute, the third letter is U, not A. So flute doesn't have A at position 3.
 - The word must have 'A' at position 3.

 Therefore, the word must be: [c] L A T E

 Let me find words that end with ""LATE"":
   plate: P L A T E -> valid
   elate: E L A T E -> but E is already at the end? Wait, elate: E at position 1? That might be allowed? But note, we don't know if E can appear twice? The feedback for E was a check only at position 5. It doesn't prevent E from being elsewhere? However, the feedback for E(✓) means that at position 5 there is E. But the word might have an E elsewhere? However, in the feedback, we didn't get any other E marked, but since only one E was guessed and it was correct, it doesn't say anything about duplicates.

 But let me consider the feedback: the secret word might have duplicate letters? But the feedback notation doesn't explicitly show duplicates? Actually, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback will reflect that. But in this case, we didn't have any duplicate in the guess.

 However, our guess ""slate"" had one S, one L, one A, one T, one E.

 The feedback said S is absent, L present and correct, A present and correct, T present and correct, E present and correct.

 Therefore, the secret word must have L,A,T,E in positions 2,3,4,5 and one more letter at position 1, and that letter is not S.

 Important: the secret word might have duplicate letters? But note that we have 5 distinct letters in the guess. However, if the secret word had duplicates, then if the duplicate letter was one that we guessed, it would have been marked. For instance, if the secret word had two L's, then in our guess the L at position 2 would be correct, but if there was another L elsewhere, we didn't guess it so we wouldn't know.

 However, for now, since we have L,A,T,E fixed, and one unknown at position 1, and the word is 5 letters, the secret word has exactly those 4 letters and one more.

 Therefore, the word must be: [new letter] L A T E

 We need a word that fits: _ L A T E.

 Some possibilities:
 - plate: P L A T E
 - elate: E L A T E -> but E is already at the end? That would mean the word has two E's? But feedback didn't show any duplication? However, in the feedback we only guessed one E and it was correct. If the secret word is ""elate"", then it has E at position 1 and position 5. But in our guess, we only had E at position 5. So the feedback for E only tells us that position 5 is E. It doesn't say anything about position 1.

 So we must consider both possibilities: the word might have an E at position 1? But note that we were told E(✓) at position 5, so if we guess ""elate"", we would then get feedback on position 1 E? But we don't know it yet.

 However, we are making the second guess. We can try to use a word that helps us determine the first letter.

 But actually, we can narrow it down: the first letter can be any letter except S (which was ruled out) and must form a valid word.

 Let me list common words ending in LATE:
   plate, slate (but S is invalid), elate, blate (rare), plate is the most common.

 Also: there are words like flate (not common, and actually not a valid English word?).
 Only about 12 words end with LATE: https://www.wordhippo.com/what-is/words-ending-with/late.html

 Among them: 
   elate, plate, slate, dilate (but that's 6 letters, wait no: dilate is 6 letters? D-I-L-A-T-E -> 6? Wait no, 6 letters? Actually, dilate is D-I-L-A-T-E -> D at 1, I at 2, L at 3? Wait, no: positions:
   D(1), I(2), L(3), A(4), T(5), E(6) -> 6 letters? Actually, dilate is 6 letters. 

 5-letter words: 
   elate, laten (but we have T at position 4? Laten: L-A-T-E-N -> not matching because position 2 is A? But we require L at position 2?).
   Actually, we must have the pattern: [x] L A T E.

 Searching for words: 
   plate: P L A T E -> valid
   elate: E L A T E -> valid? And then the word has two E's? 
   but also: blate (archaic for bashful), but rare.
   and: clate (not a word)
   and: llate (not a word)

 Also: late is 4 letters? So the pattern is fixed: ?LATE

 The most common words: plate, elate.

 But note: elate has E at the beginning and at the end. The feedback from the first guess doesn't rule out E at the beginning because we only had one E at the end.

 However, we did get E(✓) only at position 5. That doesn't tell us about E elsewhere? Actually, if the word had E at position 1, then in our first guess we did not have a letter E at position 1, so we wouldn't have marked it? The feedback only marks the letters that we guessed.

 Therefore, we don't know about E at other positions? But in fact, we didn't guess a letter at position 1? We guessed S at position 1. So the position 1 was incorrect and it was S. But if there had been an E at position 1, we wouldn't know because we didn't guess E for position 1? 

 However, the feedback for the first guess does not indicate the presence of E at position 1? Why? Because we didn't guess E at position 1. We only have E at position 5. So we only know about E at position 5.

 Therefore, the secret word might have additional E's? But the feedback system: if the secret word had an E at position 1 and we didn't guess it, then it wouldn't show any mark for position 1? No, the feedback marks only the letters we guessed. For E, we guessed only at position 5 and it was correct. So we don't know about E at other positions.

 Therefore, we must consider words that are of the form [letter] L A T E, and [letter] can be any letter that forms a word, except S. So both plate and elate are possible.

 How can we figure out the first letter?

 We can choose a word that has the first letter being a common letter? But note, we only have one position to figure out. So we can guess a word that includes other letters to test? However, we are constrained: the positions 2,3,4,5 are fixed! So we cannot change them? 

 Actually, we know that positions 2,3,4,5 are fixed to L,A,T,E. So the only unknown is position 1. Therefore, we can try a word that has the pattern: ? L A T E. 

 Since we have only one unknown, we can guess one of the possibilities. If we guess ""plate"", then:
   if it's plate, then we win.
   if it's not plate, then we get feedback that P is not present? Then the next guess would be ""elate"". 

 But note: we are allowed 6 tries. So we can guess:

   Guess 2: plate
        if the word is plate: we win.
        if feedback: P(x) L(✓) A(✓) T(✓) E(✓) -> then we know the first letter is not P, and it must be E? Then we guess elate.

   Alternatively, we can guess ""elate"" now? Similarly.

 Let me see: if we guess ""elate"" now:

        if the secret is elate: then E(✓) L(✓) A(✓) T(✓) E(✓) -> we win.

        if the secret is plate: then E(x) L(✓) A(✓) T(✓) E(✓) -> because the first E is not in the word? But wait, plate has no E at the beginning? Then the first letter would be E(x) meaning not present? Actually, plate has P at position 1. So E is not in the word? Then the feedback would be: E(x) L(✓) A(✓) T(✓) E(✓) -> but wait, we have two E's in the guess? 

 Important: the guess ""elate"" has two E's: one at position 1 and one at position 5.

 Now, the secret word: plate -> has E only at position 5.

 How does feedback handle duplicate letters?

 Typically, in Wordle rules:
   For duplicate letters, they are treated independently. But also, the feedback can be tricky.

 Example: 
   Secret: PLATE
   Guess: ELATE

   Position 1: E -> it is not in the secret at all? Because the secret has one E and it's at position 5? Then the E at position 1 should be marked as 'x'?
   Position 5: E -> correct.

   But what about the single E in the secret? It is already accounted for by the E at position 5? Then the E at position 1 should be absent? So we would get: E(x) L(✓) A(✓) T(✓) E(✓). 

 However, note: there is only one E in the secret. So the position 1 E is not present? Hence marked x.

 Alternatively, if the secret was ELATE (two E's) and we guess ELATE, then both E's would be correct.

 But in our case, for the secret we don't know if it has one E or two.

 But from the first guess, we only know that there is at least one E (at position 5) and it doesn't say anything about additional E's.

 So, when we guess ""elate"", we could get:
   First letter feedback: 
        if the secret begins with E: then ✓
        else: x

 Since we know that position 5 is E and correct, the first letter being E might be x if there is no additional E? Or if the secret has two E's? 

 Therefore, to maximize information? But we are constrained: we have to fill the pattern.

 Alternatively, note that we can also use a word that is not exactly fitting the pattern? However, the pattern is fixed: positions 2,3,4,5 must be L,A,T,E. So we cannot change them? Then we have to only change the first letter? 

 So we have no choice but to try one of the possibilities? Since the pattern is fixed.

 How many possibilities? There are two major ones: plate and elate. Others are rare:

   Words ending in ""LATE"": 
   - plate (most common)
   - elate (also common)
   - blate (rare, archaic)
   - I think that's it? And slate is out because S is excluded.

 So we have two strong candidates: plate and elate.

 Since we are only on the second guess, we can try one. If it fails, we know the next.

 Let's choose the more common one: plate.

 But note: if we guess plate and it's wrong, we still have 4 guesses left? Then we can try elate.

 Alternatively, we can use a guess that contains more new letters? But we are constrained by the pattern: we must have L in position 2, A in 3, T in 4, E in 5? So we cannot change them? How to introduce more letters? 

 Actually, we are allowed to guess any word? Even if it doesn't use the known letters? But that wouldn't help. Because we know positions 2,3,4,5 are fixed? We can try to confirm the fixed positions? But we know they are fixed? The feedback gave them as correct. So they are correct? We don't need to change them? 

 Therefore, the best strategy is to try one of the possibilities. Let's choose ""plate"". 

 If we guess ""plate"", what happens?
   Case 1: Secret word is plate -> win.
   Case 2: Secret word is elate -> then:
        P(?) L(✓) A(✓) T(✓) E(✓) -> but P would be x? Then we know the first letter must be E? So then next guess elate.

   Case 3: Secret word is blate? Then: P(x) L(✓) A(✓) T(✓) E(✓) -> same as case 2? Then we know first letter is not P and we try other letters.

 But note: blate is rare? And plate is more common.

 Also, there's ""laten""? But not 5 letters in the pattern? It's L-A-T-E-N? Pattern: 5 letters: so ?LATE. Then blate? 

 Therefore, I think ""plate"" is a good guess.

 Let me make the guess: plate

 But remember: the word must be valid. ""plate"" is a valid English word.

<guess>plate</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""slate"":
- S is not in the word (x).
- L, A, T, and E are in the word and in the correct positions (✓ at positions 2, 3, 4, and 5 respectively).

This means the secret word follows the pattern: _ L A T E, where the first letter is unknown (but cannot be S). The goal is to determine the first letter.

Considering common English words fitting this pattern:
- ""plate"" is a strong candidate, as P is a common starting letter.
- Alternatively, ""elate"" could be possible, but ""plate"" appears more frequently and is prioritized due to likelihood.

Guessing ""plate"" tests the first letter directly:
- If correct, the game is won.
- If incorrect, the feedback will reveal that the first letter is not P, narrowing down to other possibilities like ""elate"" or rare options (e.g., ""blate"").

This guess maximizes efficiency, as it focuses on the only unknown position while confirming fixed letters.

<guess>plate</guess>",plate,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""slate"":
 S(x) means 'S' is not in the secret word.
 L(✓) means 'L' is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
 A(✓) means 'A' is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
 T(✓) means 'T' is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
 E(✓) means 'E' is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

 So, from the feedback, we know:
 - The secret word has the letters L, A, T, E in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 respectively.
 - The letter S is not in the word.

 Therefore, the secret word is of the form: _ L A T E

 Now, we need to find a word that fits: [letter1] L A T E

 Known constraints:
 - The word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.
 - The first letter cannot be S (since S is not in the word).

 We have 6 tries, and this is the second guess.

 Our goal is to figure out the first letter.

 However, note: from the feedback, we only have one letter missing (the first one), and the rest are fixed: L in position 2, A in 3, T in 4, E in 5.

 So we need a word of the form: ? L A T E

 Let's think of common letters for the first position.

 Possible words: 
   plate, slate (but S is not allowed), late is 4 letters? So we need 5 letters.

 Some possibilities:
 - plate: P L A T E
 - flute: F L U T E -> but U and T? Wait, our fixed positions: L at 2, A at 3? In flute, the third letter is U, not A. So flute doesn't have A at position 3.
 - The word must have 'A' at position 3.

 Therefore, the word must be: [c] L A T E

 Let me find words that end with ""LATE"":
   plate: P L A T E -> valid
   elate: E L A T E -> but E is already at the end? Wait, elate: E at position 1? That might be allowed? But note, we don't know if E can appear twice? The feedback for E was a check only at position 5. It doesn't prevent E from being elsewhere? However, the feedback for E(✓) means that at position 5 there is E. But the word might have an E elsewhere? However, in the feedback, we didn't get any other E marked, but since only one E was guessed and it was correct, it doesn't say anything about duplicates.

 But let me consider the feedback: the secret word might have duplicate letters? But the feedback notation doesn't explicitly show duplicates? Actually, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback will reflect that. But in this case, we didn't have any duplicate in the guess.

 However, our guess ""slate"" had one S, one L, one A, one T, one E.

 The feedback said S is absent, L present and correct, A present and correct, T present and correct, E present and correct.

 Therefore, the secret word must have L,A,T,E in positions 2,3,4,5 and one more letter at position 1, and that letter is not S.

 Important: the secret word might have duplicate letters? But note that we have 5 distinct letters in the guess. However, if the secret word had duplicates, then if the duplicate letter was one that we guessed, it would have been marked. For instance, if the secret word had two L's, then in our guess the L at position 2 would be correct, but if there was another L elsewhere, we didn't guess it so we wouldn't know.

 Some possibilities:

 - elate: E L A T E -> but E is already at the end? That would mean the word has two E's? But feedback didn't show any duplication? However, in the feedback we only guessed one E and it was correct. If the secret word is ""elate"", then it has E at position 1 and position 5. But in our guess, we only had E at position 5. So the feedback for E only tells us that position 5 is E. It doesn't say anything about position 1.

 So we must consider both possibilities: the word might have an E at position 1? But note that we were told E(✓) at position 5, so if we guess ""elate"", we would then get feedback on position 1 E? But we don't know it yet.

 However, we are making the second guess. We can try to use a word that helps us determine the first letter.

   plate, slate (but S is invalid), elate, blate (rare), plate is the most common.

 Also: there are words like flate (not common, and actually not a valid English word?).
 Only about 12 words end with LATE: https://www.wordhippo.com/what-is/words-ending-with/late.html

 Among them: 
   elate, plate, slate, dilate (but that's 6 letters, wait no: dilate is 6 letters? D-I-L-A-T-E -> 6? Wait no, 6 letters? Actually, dilate is D-I-L-A-T-E -> D at 1, I at 2, L at 3? Wait, no: positions:
   D(1), I(2), L(3), A(4), T(5), E(6) -> 6 letters? Actually, dilate is 6 letters. 

 5-letter words: 
   elate, laten (but we have T at position 4? Laten: L-A-T-E-N -> not matching because position 2 is A? But we require L at position 2?).
   Actually, we must have the pattern: [x] L A T E.

 Searching for words: 
   plate: P L A T E -> valid
   elate: E L A T E -> valid? And then the word has two E's? 
   but also: blate (archaic for bashful), but rare.
   and: clate (not a word)
   and: llate (not a word)

 Also: late is 4 letters? So the pattern is fixed: ?LATE

 The most common words: plate, elate.

 But note: elate has E at the beginning and at the end. The feedback from the first guess doesn't rule out E at the beginning because we only had one E at the end.

 However, we did get E(✓) only at position 5. That doesn't tell us about E elsewhere? Actually, if the word had E at position 1, then in our first guess we did not have a letter E at position 1, so we wouldn't have marked it? The feedback only marks the letters that we guessed.

 Therefore, we don't know about E at other positions? But in fact, we didn't guess a letter at position 1? We guessed S at position 1. So the position 1 was incorrect and it was S. But if there had been an E at position 1, we wouldn't know because we didn't guess E for position 1? 

 However, the feedback for the first guess does not indicate the presence of E at position 1? Why? Because we didn't guess E at position 1. We only have E at position 5. So we only know about E at position 5.

 Therefore, the secret word might have additional E's? But the feedback system: if the secret word had an E at position 1 and we didn't guess it, then it wouldn't show any mark for position 1? No, the feedback marks only the letters we guessed. For E, we guessed only at position 5 and it was correct. So we don't know about E at other positions.

 Therefore, we must consider words that are of the form [letter] L A T E, and [letter] can be any letter that forms a word, except S. So both plate and elate are possible.

 How can we figure out the first letter?

 We can choose a word that has the first letter being a common letter? But note, we only have one position to figure out. So we can guess a word that includes other letters to test? However, we are constrained: the positions 2,3,4,5 are fixed! So we cannot change them? 

 Actually, we know that positions 2,3,4,5 are fixed to L,A,T,E. So the only unknown is position 1. Therefore, we can try a word that has the pattern: ? L A T E. 

 Since we have only one unknown, we can guess one of the possibilities. If we guess ""plate"", then:
   if it's plate, then we win.
   if it's not plate, then we get feedback that P is not present? Then the next guess would be ""elate"". 

 But note: we are allowed 6 tries. So we can guess:

   Guess 2: plate
        if the word is plate: we win.
        if feedback: P(x) L(✓) A(✓) T(✓) E(✓) -> then we know the first letter is not P, and it must be E? Then we guess elate.

   Alternatively, we can guess ""elate"" now? Similarly.

 Let me see: if we guess ""elate"" now:

        if the secret is elate: then E(✓) L(✓) A(✓) T(✓) E(✓) -> we win.

        if the secret is plate: then E(x) L(✓) A(✓) T(✓) E(✓) -> because the first E is not in the word? But wait, plate has no E at the beginning? Then the first letter would be E(x) meaning not present? Actually, plate has P at position 1. So E is not in the word? Then the feedback would be: E(x) L(✓) A(✓) T(✓) E(✓) -> but wait, we have two E's in the guess? 

 Important: the guess ""elate"" has two E's: one at position 1 and one at position 5.

 Now, the secret word: plate -> has E only at position 5.

 How does feedback handle duplicate letters?

 Typically, in Wordle rules:
   For duplicate letters, they are treated independently. But also, the feedback can be tricky.

 Example: 
   Secret: PLATE
   Guess: ELATE

   Position 1: E -> it is not in the secret at all? Because the secret has one E and it's at position 5? Then the E at position 1 should be marked as 'x'?
   Position 5: E -> correct.

   But what about the single E in the secret? It is already accounted for by the E at position 5? Then the E at position 1 should be absent? So we would get: E(x) L(✓) A(✓) T(✓) E(✓). 

 However, note: there is only one E in the secret. So the position 1 E is not present? Hence marked x.

 Alternatively, if the secret was ELATE (two E's) and we guess ELATE, then both E's would be correct.

 But in our case, for the secret we don't know if it has one E or two.

 But from the first guess, we only know that there is at least one E (at position 5) and it doesn't say anything about additional E's.

 So, when we guess ""elate"", we could get:
   First letter feedback: 
        if the secret begins with E: then ✓
        else: x

 Since we know that position 5 is E and correct, the first letter being E might be x if there is no additional E? Or if the secret has two E's? 

 Therefore, to maximize information? But we are constrained: we have to fill the pattern.

 Alternatively, note that we can also use a word that is not exactly fitting the pattern? However, the pattern is fixed: positions 2,3,4,5 must be L,A,T,E. So we cannot change them? Then we have to only change the first letter? 

 So we have no choice but to try one of the possibilities? Since the pattern is fixed.

 How many possibilities? There are two major ones: plate and elate. Others are rare:

   Words ending in ""LATE"": 
   - plate (most common)
   - elate (also common)
   - blate (rare, archaic)
   - I think that's it? And slate is out because S is excluded.

 So we have two strong candidates: plate and elate.

 Since we are only on the second guess, we can try one. If it fails, we know the next.

 Let's choose the more common one: plate.

 But note: if we guess plate and it's wrong, we still have 4 guesses left? Then we can try elate.

 Alternatively, we can use a guess that contains more new letters? But we are constrained by the pattern: we must have L in position 2, A in 3, T in 4, E in 5? So we cannot change them? How to introduce more letters? 

 Actually, we are allowed to guess any word? Even if it doesn't use the known letters? But that wouldn't help. Because we know positions 2,3,4,5 are fixed? We can try to confirm the fixed positions? But we know they are fixed? The feedback gave them as correct. So they are correct? We don't need to change them? 

 Therefore, the best strategy is to try one of the possibilities. Let's choose ""plate"". 

 If we guess ""plate"", what happens?
   Case 1: Secret word is plate -> win.
   Case 2: Secret word is elate -> then:
        P(?) L(✓) A(✓) T(✓) E(✓) -> but P would be x? Then we know the first letter must be E? So then next guess elate.

   Case 3: Secret word is blate? Then: P(x) L(✓) A(✓) T(✓) E(✓) -> same as case 2? Then we know first letter is not P and we try other letters.

 But note: blate is rare? And plate is more common.

 Also, there's ""laten""? But not 5 letters in the pattern? It's L-A-T-E-N? Pattern: 5 letters: so ?LATE. Then blate? 

 Therefore, I think ""plate"" is a good guess.

 Let me make the guess: plate

 But remember: the word must be valid. ""plate"" is a valid English word.

<guess>plate</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""slate"":
- S is not in the word (x).
- L, A, T, and E are in the word and in the correct positions (✓ at positions 2, 3, 4, and 5 respectively).

This means the secret word follows the pattern: _ L A T E, where the first letter is unknown (but cannot be S). The goal is to determine the first letter.

Considering common English words fitting this pattern:
- ""plate"" is a strong candidate, as P is a common starting letter.
- Alternatively, ""elate"" could be possible, but ""plate"" appears more frequently and is prioritized due to likelihood.

Guessing ""plate"" tests the first letter directly:
- If correct, the game is won.
- If incorrect, the feedback will reveal that the first letter is not P, narrowing down to other possibilities like ""elate"" or rare options (e.g., ""blate"").

This guess maximizes efficiency, as it focuses on the only unknown position while confirming fixed letters.",Guess 2: plate -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) L(✓) A(✓) T(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
