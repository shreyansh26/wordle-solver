We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the last letter and in the 5th position)

 Therefore, we know:
 - The word ends with E (5th letter is E).
 - The letter A is in the word but not in the 2nd position (since we guessed A in the 2nd position and it was marked as wrong position).
 - The letters C, R, and N are not in the word.

 Since the word has an A and an E, and we know the E is at the end, we can try to form a new guess.

 Important: We must avoid using C, R, N (since they are not in the word) and we know A is present but not in the 2nd position.

 We have 6 tries, so we can use this information to make a second guess.

 We also know the word is 5 letters and the last letter is E.

 Let's think of words that end with E and contain A (but not in the second position) and without C, R, N.

 We can also try to include other common letters to test.

 Since A is in the word but not in position 2, it could be in position 1, 3, 4? But note: we have the 5th as E, so A cannot be in 5th.

 Possibilities for A: positions 1, 3, or 4.

 We also don't know the other letters. We should try to cover more common consonants.

 Let's avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, N.

 Common consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We also know that the word has at least two vowels? Not necessarily, but we have A and E.

 We can try a word that has A in a different position and also tests other common letters.

 Example: We can try to put A in the first position? But note, we don't know if A is in the first. Alternatively, we can put A in the third or fourth.

 Let's try to use a word that has A in the 3rd position and also includes other common letters.

 But note: we also want to test for other vowels? We already have E, and we know the word has A. The word might have more vowels? Or not.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in the 4th position? 

 However, we must remember that we have only 5 positions and the last is E.

 Let me think of words ending with E and containing A (not in the 2nd) and without C, R, N.

 Some possibilities: 
 - ...A.E -> but the A would be in the 4th? Then the word would be ? ? ? A E. But we don't know the first three.

 We can try to use a word that has A in the 1st position? For example: A _ _ _ E. But we don't know the middle.

 But note: we have to avoid C, R, N.

 Let me list some words that fit:
 - ABASE: ends with E, has A in first and fourth? But we don't know if A is repeated? The feedback for the first guess only showed one A, but there could be more? We don't know.

 However, in our first guess, we had A in the second position and it was marked as present but wrong. The word might have only one A? Or more? We don't know.

 But note: the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates unless we guess duplicates. So we have to be cautious.

 Since we are limited by the absent letters (C, R, N) and the known present letters (A, E) and the position of E (5th), we can try:

 Let's try the word ""SAUTE"". 
 - S: test a common letter
 - A: in the second position? But wait, we know A is not in the second position? Actually, no: the feedback said A was in the word but not in the second position. So we should avoid putting A in the second position again.

 Therefore, in our new guess, we should put A in a different position: either 1, 3, or 4.

 But note: we also want to test other letters.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in the first position: e.g., ""ADOBE"" -> but that has O and B and D. However, we don't know if O is present? Also, note that we have to avoid R and C and N? ""ADOBE"" has no R, C, N. But we have to check: A (1st), D (2nd), O (3rd), B (4th), E (5th). 

 But wait, we know that the 5th is E, so that's fixed. So we can try:

 However, we also have the constraint that A is present and not in the 2nd. Putting A in the 1st is acceptable.

 But let me see: if we try ""ADOBE"", then:
 - A: if the word has A in the first, then it would be marked as correct? But if not, then it might be marked as present or absent.

 However, we don't know if the word has A in the first. We only know that A is in the word and not in the second.

 Alternatively, we can try to put A in the 3rd or 4th.

 Another idea: we can try to use a word that has A in the 4th position? For example: ""PLATE"" -> but we have to avoid R? Wait, ""PLATE"" has T and L and P, but also note: we don't know if T, L, P are present. However, we must avoid R? But ""PLATE"" doesn't have R? Actually, it doesn't. But we also must avoid C and N? ""PLATE"" has no C, R, N.

 But wait: we have to consider the feedback for the first guess: we had A in the second position and it was marked as present but wrong. So if we put A in the 4th in ""PLATE"", that would be a new position.

 However, note that ""PLATE"" has the E at the end, which is correct. And the A is in the 4th? Actually, in ""PLATE"": 
 P L A T E -> A is in the 3rd position, not 4th.

 Let me break down ""PLATE"":
 Position 1: P
 Position 2: L
 Position 3: A
 Position 4: T
 Position 5: E

 So A is in the 3rd.

 That's acceptable because we haven't tried A in the 3rd.

 But note: we also have to test other letters. We want to maximize information.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in the 1st and also tests other common letters? 

 Let me think of words that end with E and have A in the 1st, without C, R, N:
 - ABASE: A B A S E -> but has two A's? We don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we are using A twice, which might not be efficient for testing new letters.
 - AGATE: A G A T E -> again two A's.
 - ALATE: A L A T E -> two A's.

 How about words with A in the 1st and without repeating A?
 - ABLE: only 4 letters? Not 5.
 - AWAKE: A W A K E -> two A's.
 - AZURE: A Z U R E -> but R is not allowed (we know R is absent).

 We must avoid R.

 How about ""AFIRE""? But has R -> not allowed.

 How about ""AMUSE"": A M U S E -> no R, C, N. And only one A? Actually, it has A and then U, S, E.

 So ""AMUSE"": 
 A (1st), M (2nd), U (3rd), S (4th), E (5th)

 This tests:
 - A in the first position: if it's correct, we get a check. If not, but if the word has A and it's in the first, then it would be correct? Actually, if the word has A in the first, then we get a check. If the word has A but not in the first, then we get a dash? But we know A is in the word, so if we put A in the first and it's not the correct position, then we get a dash? But we also know that the word has A and it's not in the second. So if we put it in the first, we might get either check or dash.

 Alternatively, we can try to put A in the 3rd or 4th to see if it's there.

 Since we don't have much information, we can try to cover more common consonants.

 Another common starting approach is to use a word that has the known letters (A and E) and then test other common consonants (like T, L, S, etc.) without the forbidden letters.

 Let me try to form a word that has:
 - E at the end (fixed)
 - A in a new position (not 2nd) and not the 5th (which is E) so either 1, 3, or 4.
 - and includes T, L, S, or other common letters.

 Example: ""SLATE"" -> S L A T E
 - S: test S
 - L: test L
 - A: in the 3rd position (which we haven't tried)
 - T: test T
 - E: at the end (correct)

 But note: we must avoid R, C, N? ""SLATE"" has no R, C, N.

 However, we already tried the letter A in the second position and it was present but wrong. Now we are trying A in the third. This is a good test.

 Alternatively, we can try ""PLATE"" (as I thought earlier) which is similar: P L A T E.

 But which one? Both are valid. Let's choose one that has more common letters.

 We haven't tested S, L, T, P, etc.

 Since we want to test as many new letters as possible, we can choose a word that doesn't repeat the letters we already know are absent.

 We know C, R, N are absent. So we can use any other letters.

 I think ""SLATE"" is a good choice because it has S, L, T which are very common.

 But note: we also have the E at the end, which we know is correct. So we are testing the first four letters.

 However, we must be cautious: if the word has duplicate letters, we might get unexpected feedback. But we don't have any duplicate in ""SLATE"".

 So let's go with ""SLATE"".

 But wait: what if the word has A in the first position? Then by putting A in the third, we might not get the A in the first. But that's okay because we are testing.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in the first and also tests other letters? But we don't have a good candidate without R, C, N and without repeating A.

 I think ""SLATE"" is a reasonable second guess.

 Let me write it: S L A T E

 But note: the word is 5 letters, so ""SLATE"" is 5 letters.

 However, we must make sure that we are not using any forbidden letters: no C, R, N. ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E -> no C, R, N. Good.

 So I will guess ""SLATE"".

 But wait: we have the feedback that in the first guess, the letter E was in the correct position (5th). So in ""SLATE"", we are putting E at the 5th, which is correct. That will be a check.

 The other positions: 
 - S at 1st: we don't know if it's present or not.
 - L at 2nd: same.
 - A at 3rd: we know A is in the word, but we don't know if it's in the 3rd.
 - T at 4th: we don't know.

 This guess will help us locate A and also test S, L, T.

 Therefore, I choose ""SLATE"".

 However, note: we have to consider that the word might have the letter A in the 4th? Then we are not testing the 4th with A. But we are testing T in the 4th. If we get feedback that A is still not in the 3rd, then we know it must be in the 1st or 4th? But we are testing the 3rd. If the A is in the 4th, then in this guess the A would be in the 3rd and marked as absent? No, wait: the feedback for A would be: if the word has A and it's in the 4th, then when we put A in the 3rd, it would be marked as present but wrong (dash). Because the A is in the word but not in the 3rd.

 So we can still get information.

 Alternatively, if we get a dash for A, then we know A is not in the 3rd, so it must be in the 1st or 4th.

 And if we get a check for A, then we know it's in the 3rd.

 So it's a good test.

 Therefore, I will go with ""SLATE"".

 But note: we have to avoid using the same letter in the same position if we know it's wrong? We don't have that for A because we only tried position 2 and now we are trying 3.

 So, second guess: ""SLATE""

<guess>slate</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, N** are absent (marked ""x"").
- **A** is present but not in the 2nd position (marked ""-"").
- **E** is correct and in the 5th position (marked ""✓"").

For the second guess:
- The word must end with **E** (5th letter).
- **A** must be included but not in the 2nd position (so positions 1, 3, or 4 are candidates).
- Avoid **C, R, N** entirely.
- Test new common consonants (e.g., **S, L, T**) to gather more information.

The word **""SLATE""** fits these criteria:
- Ends with **E** (correct position).
- Places **A** in the 3rd position (a new position to test).
- Uses **S, L, T** (common letters not yet tested).
- Excludes forbidden letters (C, R, N).

This guess will help identify the position of **A** and test **S, L, T** efficiently.

 R: x (not in the word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)

 We know C, R, N are absent. So we can use any other letters.

 I think ""SLATE"" is a good choice because it has S, L, T which are very common.

 But note: we also have the E at the end, which we know is correct. So we are testing the first four letters.

 However, we must be cautious: if the word has duplicate letters, we might get unexpected feedback. But we don't have any duplicate in ""SLATE"".

 So let's go with ""SLATE"".

 But wait: what if the word has A in the first position? Then by putting A in the third, we might not get the A in the first. But that's okay because we are testing.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in the first and also tests other letters? But we don't have a good candidate without R, C, N and without repeating A.

 I think ""SLATE"" is a reasonable second guess.

 Let me write it: S L A T E

 But note: the word is 5 letters, so ""SLATE"" is 5 letters.

 However, we must make sure that we are not using any forbidden letters: no C, R, N. ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E -> no C, R, N. Good.

 So I will guess ""SLATE"".

 But wait: we have the feedback that in the first guess, the letter E was in the correct position (5th). So in ""SLATE"", we are putting E at the 5th, which is correct. That will be a check.

 The other positions: 
 - S at 1st: we don't know if it's present or not.
 - L at 2nd: same.
 - A at 3rd: we know A is in the word, but we don't know if it's in the 3rd.
 - T at 4th: we don't know.

 This guess will help us locate A and also test S, L, T.

 Therefore, I choose ""SLATE"".

 However, note: we have to consider that the word might have the letter A in the 4th? Then we are not testing the 4th with A. But we are testing T in the 4th. If we get feedback that A is still not in the 3rd, then we know it must be in the 1st or 4th? But we are testing the 3rd. If the A is in the 4th, then in this guess the A would be in the 3rd and marked as absent? No, wait: the feedback for A would be: if the word has A and it's in the 4th, then when we put A in the 3rd, it would be marked as present but wrong (dash). Because the A is in the word but not in the 3rd.

 So we can still get information.

 Alternatively, if we get a dash for A, then we know A is not in the 3rd, so it must be in the 1st or 4th.

 And if we get a check for A, then we know it's in the 3rd.

 So it's a good test.

 Therefore, I will go with ""SLATE"".

 But note: we have to avoid using the same letter in the same position if we know it's wrong? We don't have that for A because we only tried position 2 and now we are trying 3.

 So, second guess: ""SLATE""

<guess>slate</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, N** are absent (marked ""x"").
- **A** is present but not in the 2nd position (marked ""-"").
- **E** is correct and in the 5th position (marked ""✓"").

For the second guess:
- The word must end with **E** (5th letter).
- **A** must be included but not in the 2nd position (so positions 1, 3, or 4 are candidates).
- Avoid **C, R, N** entirely.
- Test new common consonants (e.g., **S, L, T**) to gather more information.

The word **""SLATE""** fits these criteria:
- Ends with **E** (correct position).
- Places **A** in the 3rd position (a new position to test).
- Uses **S, L, T** (common letters not yet tested).
- Excludes forbidden letters (C, R, N).

This guess will help identify the position of **A** and test **S, L, T** efficiently.",Guess 2: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,FABLE,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the last letter and in the 5th position)

 Therefore, we know:
 - The word ends with E (5th letter is E).
 - The letter A is in the word but not in the 2nd position (since we guessed A in the 2nd position and it was marked as wrong position).
 - The letters C, R, and N are not in the word.

 Since the word has an A and an E, and we know the E is at the end, we can try to form a new guess.

 Important: We must avoid using C, R, N (since they are not in the word) and we know A is present but not in the 2nd position.

 We have 6 tries, so we can use this information to make a second guess.

 We also know the word is 5 letters and the last letter is E.

 Let's think of words that end with E and contain A (but not in the second position) and without C, R, N.

 We can also try to include other common letters to test.

 Since A is in the word but not in position 2, it could be in position 1, 3, 4? But note: we have the 5th as E, so A cannot be in 5th.

 Possibilities for A: positions 1, 3, or 4.

 We also don't know the other letters. We should try to cover more common consonants.

 Let's avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, N.

 Common consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We also know that the word has at least two vowels? Not necessarily, but we have A and E.

 We can try a word that has A in a different position and also tests other common letters.

 Example: We can try to put A in the first position? But note, we don't know if A is in the first. Alternatively, we can put A in the third or fourth.

 Let's try to use a word that has A in the 3rd position and also includes other common letters.

 But note: we also want to test for other vowels? We already have E, and we know the word has A. The word might have more vowels? Or not.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in the 4th position? 

 However, we must remember that we have only 5 positions and the last is E.

 Let me think of words ending with E and containing A (not in the 2nd) and without C, R, N.

 Some possibilities: 
 - ...A.E -> but the A would be in the 4th? Then the word would be ? ? ? A E. But we don't know the first three.

 We can try to use a word that has A in the 1st position? For example: A _ _ _ E. But we don't know the middle.

 But note: we have to avoid C, R, N.

 Let me list some words that fit:
 - ABASE: ends with E, has A in first and fourth? But we don't know if A is repeated? The feedback for the first guess only showed one A, but there could be more? We don't know.

 However, in our first guess, we had A in the second position and it was marked as present but wrong. The word might have only one A? Or more? We don't know.

 But note: the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates unless we guess duplicates. So we have to be cautious.

 Since we are limited by the absent letters (C, R, N) and the known present letters (A, E) and the position of E (5th), we can try:

 Let's try the word ""SAUTE"". 
 - S: test a common letter
 - A: in the second position? But wait, we know A is not in the second position? Actually, no: the feedback said A was in the word but not in the second position. So we should avoid putting A in the second position again.

 Therefore, in our new guess, we should put A in a different position: either 1, 3, or 4.

 But note: we also want to test other letters.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in the first position: e.g., ""ADOBE"" -> but that has O and B and D. However, we don't know if O is present? Also, note that we have to avoid R and C and N? ""ADOBE"" has no R, C, N. But we have to check: A (1st), D (2nd), O (3rd), B (4th), E (5th). 

 But wait, we know that the 5th is E, so that's fixed. So we can try:

 However, we also have the constraint that A is present and not in the 2nd. Putting A in the 1st is acceptable.

 But let me see: if we try ""ADOBE"", then:
 - A: if the word has A in the first, then it would be marked as correct? But if not, then it might be marked as present or absent.

 However, we don't know if the word has A in the first. We only know that A is in the word and not in the second.

 Alternatively, we can try to put A in the 3rd or 4th.

 Another idea: we can try to use a word that has A in the 4th position? For example: ""PLATE"" -> but we have to avoid R? Wait, ""PLATE"" has T and L and P, but also note: we don't know if T, L, P are present. However, we must avoid R? But ""PLATE"" doesn't have R? Actually, it doesn't. But we also must avoid C and N? ""PLATE"" has no C, R, N.

 But wait: we have to consider the feedback for the first guess: we had A in the second position and it was marked as present but wrong. So if we put A in the 4th in ""PLATE"", that would be a new position.

 However, note that ""PLATE"" has the E at the end, which is correct. And the A is in the 4th? Actually, in ""PLATE"": 
 P L A T E -> A is in the 3rd position, not 4th.

 Let me break down ""PLATE"":
 Position 1: P
 Position 2: L
 Position 3: A
 Position 4: T
 Position 5: E

 So A is in the 3rd.

 That's acceptable because we haven't tried A in the 3rd.

 But note: we also have to test other letters. We want to maximize information.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in the 1st and also tests other common letters? 

 Let me think of words that end with E and have A in the 1st, without C, R, N:
 - ABASE: A B A S E -> but has two A's? We don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we are using A twice, which might not be efficient for testing new letters.
 - AGATE: A G A T E -> again two A's.
 - ALATE: A L A T E -> two A's.

 How about words with A in the 1st and without repeating A?
 - ABLE: only 4 letters? Not 5.
 - AWAKE: A W A K E -> two A's.
 - AZURE: A Z U R E -> but R is not allowed (we know R is absent).

 We must avoid R.

 How about ""AFIRE""? But has R -> not allowed.

 How about ""AMUSE"": A M U S E -> no R, C, N. And only one A? Actually, it has A and then U, S, E.

 So ""AMUSE"": 
 A (1st), M (2nd), U (3rd), S (4th), E (5th)

 This tests:
 - A in the first position: if it's correct, we get a check. If not, but if the word has A and it's in the first, then it would be correct? Actually, if the word has A in the first, then we get a check. If the word has A but not in the first, then we get a dash? But we know A is in the word, so if we put A in the first and it's not the correct position, then we get a dash? But we also know that the word has A and it's not in the second. So if we put it in the first, we might get either check or dash.

 Alternatively, we can try to put A in the 3rd or 4th to see if it's there.

 Since we don't have much information, we can try to cover more common consonants.

 Another common starting approach is to use a word that has the known letters (A and E) and then test other common consonants (like T, L, S, etc.) without the forbidden letters.

 Let me try to form a word that has:
 - E at the end (fixed)
 - A in a new position (not 2nd) and not the 5th (which is E) so either 1, 3, or 4.
 - and includes T, L, S, or other common letters.

 Example: ""SLATE"" -> S L A T E
 - S: test S
 - L: test L
 - A: in the 3rd position (which we haven't tried)
 - T: test T
 - E: at the end (correct)

 But note: we must avoid R, C, N? ""SLATE"" has no R, C, N.

 However, we already tried the letter A in the second position and it was present but wrong. Now we are trying A in the third. This is a good test.

 Alternatively, we can try ""PLATE"" (as I thought earlier) which is similar: P L A T E.

 But which one? Both are valid. Let's choose one that has more common letters.

 We haven't tested S, L, T, P, etc.

 Since we want to test as many new letters as possible, we can choose a word that doesn't repeat the letters we already know are absent.

 We know C, R, N are absent. So we can use any other letters.

 I think ""SLATE"" is a good choice because it has S, L, T which are very common.

 But note: we also have the E at the end, which we know is correct. So we are testing the first four letters.

 However, we must be cautious: if the word has duplicate letters, we might get unexpected feedback. But we don't have any duplicate in ""SLATE"".

 So let's go with ""SLATE"".

 But wait: what if the word has A in the first position? Then by putting A in the third, we might not get the A in the first. But that's okay because we are testing.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in the first and also tests other letters? But we don't have a good candidate without R, C, N and without repeating A.

 I think ""SLATE"" is a reasonable second guess.

 Let me write it: S L A T E

 But note: the word is 5 letters, so ""SLATE"" is 5 letters.

 However, we must make sure that we are not using any forbidden letters: no C, R, N. ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E -> no C, R, N. Good.

 So I will guess ""SLATE"".

 But wait: we have the feedback that in the first guess, the letter E was in the correct position (5th). So in ""SLATE"", we are putting E at the 5th, which is correct. That will be a check.

 The other positions: 
 - S at 1st: we don't know if it's present or not.
 - L at 2nd: same.
 - A at 3rd: we know A is in the word, but we don't know if it's in the 3rd.
 - T at 4th: we don't know.

 This guess will help us locate A and also test S, L, T.

 Therefore, I choose ""SLATE"".

 However, note: we have to consider that the word might have the letter A in the 4th? Then we are not testing the 4th with A. But we are testing T in the 4th. If we get feedback that A is still not in the 3rd, then we know it must be in the 1st or 4th? But we are testing the 3rd. If the A is in the 4th, then in this guess the A would be in the 3rd and marked as absent? No, wait: the feedback for A would be: if the word has A and it's in the 4th, then when we put A in the 3rd, it would be marked as present but wrong (dash). Because the A is in the word but not in the 3rd.

 And if we get a check for A, then we know it's in the 3rd.

 So it's a good test.

 Therefore, I will go with ""SLATE"".

 But note: we have to avoid using the same letter in the same position if we know it's wrong? We don't have that for A because we only tried position 2 and now we are trying 3.

 So, second guess: ""SLATE""

<guess>slate</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":

So if we put it in the first, we might get either check or dash.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to put A in the 3rd or 4th to see if it\'s there.\n\n Since we don\'t have much information, we can try to cover more common consonants.\n\n Another common starting approach is to use a word that has the known letters (A and E) and then test other common consonants (like T, L, S, etc.) without the forbidden letters.\n\n Let me try to form a word that has:\n - E at the end (fixed)\n - A in a new position (not 2nd) and not the 5th (which is E) so either 1, 3, or 4.\n - and includes T, L, S, or other common letters.\n\n Example: ""SLATE"" -> S L A T E\n - S: test S\n - L: test L\n - A: in the 3rd position (which we haven\'t tried)\n - T: test T\n - E: at the end (correct)\n\n But note: we must avoid R, C, N? ""SLATE"" has no R, C, N.\n\n However, we already tried the letter A in the second position and it was present but wrong. Now we are trying A in the third. This is a good test.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""PLATE"" (as I thought earlier) which is similar: P L A T E.\n\n But which one? Both are valid. Let\'s choose one that has more common letters.\n\n We haven\'t tested S, L, T, P, etc.\n\n Since we want to test as many new letters as possible, we can choose a word that doesn\'t repeat the letters we already know are absent.\n\n We know C, R, N are absent. So we can use any other letters.\n\n I think ""SLATE"" is a good choice because it has S, L, T which are very common.\n\n But note: we also have the E at the end, which we know is correct. So we are testing the first four letters.\n\n However, we must be cautious: if the word has duplicate letters, we might get unexpected feedback. But we don\'t have any duplicate in ""SLATE"".\n\n So let\'s go with ""SLATE"".\n\n But wait: what if the word has A in the first position? Then by putting A in the third, we might not get the A in the first. But that\'s okay because we are testing.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in the first and also tests other letters? But we don\'t have a good candidate without R, C, N and without repeating A.\n\n I think ""SLATE"" is a reasonable second guess.\n\n Let me write it: S L A T E\n\n But note: the word is 5 letters, so ""SLATE"" is 5 letters.\n\n However, we must make sure that we are not using any forbidden letters: no C, R, N. ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E -> no C, R, N. Good.\n\n So I will guess ""SLATE"".\n\n But wait: we have the feedback that in the first guess, the letter E was in the correct position (5th). So in ""SLATE"", we are putting E at the 5th, which is correct. That will be a check.\n\n The other positions: \n - S at 1st: we don\'t know if it\'s present or not.\n - L at 2nd: same.\n - A at 3rd: we know A is in the word, but we don\'t know if it\'s in the 3rd.\n - T at 4th: we don\'t know.\n\n This guess will help us locate A and also test S, L, T.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""SLATE"".\n\n However, note: we have to consider that the word might have the letter A in the 4th? Then we are not testing the 4th with A. But we are testing T in the 4th. If we get feedback that A is still not in the 3rd, then we know it must be in the 1st or 4th? But we are testing the 3rd. If the A is in the 4th, then in this guess the A would be in the 3rd and marked as absent? No, wait: the feedback for A would be: if the word has A and it\'s in the 4th, then when we put A in the 3rd, it would be marked as present but wrong (dash). Because the A is in the word but not in the 3rd.\n\n So we can still get information.\n\n Alternatively, if we get a dash for A, then we know A is not in the 3rd, so it must be in the 1st or 4th.\n\n And if we get a check for A, then we know it\'s in the 3rd.\n\n So it\'s a good test.\n\n Therefore, I will go with ""SLATE"".\n\n But note: we have to avoid using the same letter in the same position if we know it\'s wrong? We don\'t have that for A because we only tried position 2 and now we are trying 3.\n\n So, second guess: ""SLATE""\n\n<guess>slate</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C, R, N** are absent (marked ""x"").\n- **A** is present but not in the 2nd position (marked ""-"").\n- **E** is correct and in the 5th position (marked ""✓"").\n\nFor the second guess:\n- The word must end with **E** (5th letter).\n- **A** must be included but not in the 2nd position (so positions 1, 3, or 4 are candidates).\n- Avoid **C, R, N** entirely.\n- Test new common consonants (e.g., **S, L, T**) to gather more information.\n\nThe word **""SLATE""** fits these criteria:\n- Ends with **E** (correct position).\n- Places **A** in the 3rd position (a new position to test).\n- Uses **S, L, T** (common letters not yet tested).\n- Excludes forbidden letters (C, R, N).\n\nThis guess will help identify the position of **A** and test **S, L, T** efficiently.\n\n<guess>slate</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position, and specifically not in position 2)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct, in position 5)

Guess 2: ""slate""
- S: x (not in the word)
- L: - (in the word but wrong position; since it was in position 2, it's not there)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position; now we know it's not in position 2 or 3)
- T: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct, in position 5)

So, from both guesses, we know:

1. The word ends with E (position 5 is E).
2. The letter A is in the word, but not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 3 (from second guess). Since the word has 5 letters and position 5 is E, A must be in position 1 or 4.
3. The letter L is in the word, but not in position 2 (where we placed it in the second guess).
4. The following letters are absent: C, R, N, S, T.

We also have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, L, T. So we know A, E, L are present, and C, R, N, S, T are absent.

Now, we need to form a new guess that:
- Ends with E (position 5).
- Includes A in either position 1 or 4 (since it must be in one of these).
- Includes L, but not in position 2 (and we haven't tried L in other positions yet).
- Avoids C, R, N, S, T.

Additionally, we should try to test other common letters to uncover the remaining letters.

Since A can be in position 1 or 4, we can design a guess that tests one of these possibilities.

Let's consider the possibilities for A:

Option 1: A in position 1.
Then the word is A _ _ _ E.

Option 2: A in position 4.
Then the word is _ _ _ A E.

We also know L is present and not in position 2. So L could be in position 1, 3, or 4? But if A is in position 1, then L cannot be in 1 (unless it's the same letter, but they are different). Similarly, if A is in position 4, then L cannot be in 4. Also, we haven't tried L in position 1, 3, or 4.

We should also consider that there might be other letters we haven't tested. We have used 8 letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, L, T. The alphabet has 26, so many left.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to choose a word that fits the constraints and tests new letters.

Let's try to form a word for each case to test:

First, if we assume A is in position 1, then we have A _ _ _ E. We need to fill the middle three positions. We know L is in the word, so one of the middle three must be L (but not position 2, so position 3 or 4? But position 4 is the third blank? Let me index:

Position 1: A
Position 2: ? (cannot be L, because we tried L in position 2 and it was wrong, and also not A because we know A is not in position 2)
Position 3: ?
Position 4: ?
Position 5: E

But note: we also know that L is in the word and not in position 2. So L must be in position 3 or 4? But position 4 is the fourth character. Also, we have to avoid S, T, C, R, N.

Possible words: 
- A _ L _ E -> but we need to fill position 2 and 4. And we know L is in position 3? Then we have A ? L ? E. But we don't know if L is in position 3.

Alternatively, we can try to put L in position 3 to test it.

But we don't have to fix the position of A in this guess. We can choose a word that tests A in position 4, for example.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in position 4 and L in a new position (like position 1 or 3) to test both.

Let me think of words that end with E, have A in position 4, and L in the word (but not position 2), and avoid C, R, N, S, T.

For example: 
- _ _ _ A E, and the word must contain L.

Some words: 
- ""BLARE"" -> but has R (absent) and we avoid R.
- ""FLAME"" -> F L A M E: but L is in position 2? We know L is not in position 2, so we cannot put L in position 2. Also, we are testing A in position 3? No, in ""FLAME"", A is in position 3? Let's see: F(1), L(2), A(3), M(4), E(5). But we want A in position 4? Then this is not.

We need A in position 4: so the fourth letter is A.

Example: ""OVALE""? Not a word. 
""LOCAE""? Not common.

How about ""GLAZE"": G L A Z E -> A is in position 3, not 4.

We need the fourth letter to be A: so pattern: _ _ _ A E.

Words: 
- ""PULSE"" -> but has S (absent) and U, L, but L is in position 2? P(1), U(2), L(3), S(4), E(5) -> no, A is not present.

We need a word that has A in the fourth position and E at the end, and also contains L (somewhere not position 2).

For example: 
- ""VIALE"": V I A L E -> A is in position 3, not 4.
- ""DANCE"": has C and N, absent.
- ""FABLE"": F A B L E -> A is in position 2, but we know A is not in position 2? And also, we are avoiding? F(1), A(2), B(3), L(4), E(5). But we know A is not in position 2, so this is invalid because we are putting A in position 2? We cannot put A in position 2 because we know it's not there.

We must not put A in position 2 or 3 (from feedback). So in the new guess, we can put A in position 1 or 4.

Similarly, we must not put L in position 2.

So for a word with A in position 4: _ _ _ A E, and L must be in position 1 or 3 (since position 2 is forbidden for L, and position 4 is A, so L cannot be there).

So possibilities:
- L in position 1: L _ _ A E
- L in position 3: _ _ L A E

Now, let's find words that fit:

Option 1: L in position 1: L _ _ A E
- We need to fill position 2 and 3, avoiding C, R, N, S, T, and also the letter in position 2 cannot be L (but L is already in 1) and cannot be A (but A is in 4). Also, the word must be valid.

Possible words: 
- ""LEAVE"": L E A V E -> but E is in position 2? And we have E at the end, but the word has two E's? Also, A is in position 3, not 4. We need A in position 4. So not.
- ""LOAVE"": not a common word? And A is in position 3? L O A V E -> A in 3.
- ""LAMAE"": not a word.

It's hard to find a word with A in position 4 and starting with L.

Option 2: L in position 3: _ _ L A E
- So pattern: ? ? L A E

We need to fill positions 1 and 2, avoiding C, R, N, S, T, and the letters must be from the remaining alphabet.

Possible words:
- ""BLAZE"": B L A Z E -> but L is in position 2? We have L in position 2, which we know is wrong. We cannot put L in position 2. In this pattern, we are putting L in position 3, so position 2 is a different letter.

In the pattern _ _ L A E, position 2 is the second letter, and we are not putting L there. We are putting L in position 3.

So:
Position 1: ?
Position 2: ? (cannot be L, and cannot be A because A is not in position 2, and also avoid C, R, N, S, T)
Position 3: L
Position 4: A
Position 5: E

Now, what words fit this pattern? And are valid English words.

Examples:
- ""ABLE"": only 4 letters.
- We need 5 letters: so ""??LAE""

Possible words:
- ""GLAZE"": G L A Z E -> but here L is in position 2, not 3. We need L in position 3. So not.
- ""PLACE"": P L A C E -> L in position 2, and C is absent. Not.
- ""FLAME"": F L A M E -> L in position 2. Not.

How about ""ILIAC""? I L I A C -> but C is absent, and also pattern is I(1), L(2), I(3), A(4), C(5) -> but we need E at the end? No, we need E at the end.

We need the word to end with E.

So: _ _ L A E

Words: 
- ""Kylae""? Not a word.
- ""ULNAE"": U L N A E -> but L is in position 2 (forbidden) and N is absent.
- ""ELVAE"": E L V A E -> L in position 2? E(1), L(2), V(3), A(4), E(5). But we cannot have L in position 2.

It's difficult to find a word with L in position 3 and A in position 4 and E at the end.

Alternatively, we can try the other case: A in position 1.

So pattern: A _ _ _ E

And L is in the word, not in position 2, so in position 3 or 4.

Also, avoid C, R, N, S, T.

So:
- If L in position 3: A _ L _ E
- If L in position 4: A _ _ L E

Now, let's find words.

First, A _ L _ E:
- We need to fill position 2 and 4, avoiding forbidden letters.

Position 2: cannot be L (already in 3), cannot be A (duplicate? but we don't know if A is duplicated, but we have A in 1, so position 2 is different). Also avoid C, R, N, S, T.

Position 4: similarly.

Possible words:
- ""APPLE"": A P P L E -> but L is in position 4, not 3. We are looking for L in position 3? In ""APPLE"": A(1), P(2), P(3), L(4), E(5). So L is in position 4.

We need L in position 3 for this subcase.

So A _ L _ E, with L in position 3.

Examples:
- ""AMBLE"": A M B L E -> L is in position 4? A(1), M(2), B(3), L(4), E(5). Not position 3.
- ""ADDLE"": A D D L E -> L in position 4.
- ""AGILE"": A G I L E -> L in position 4.

I'm having trouble finding a word with L in position 3.

How about ""AXILE"": A X I L E -> L in position 4.

""ANILE"": has N, absent.

""ALIKE"": A L I K E -> L in position 2, which is forbidden.

Perhaps ""AISLE"": A I S L E -> but S is absent, and L is in position 4.

It seems hard to find a word with L in position 3.

Now, the other subcase: A _ _ L E, with L in position 4.

Pattern: A ? ? L E

We need to fill position 2 and 3, avoiding C, R, N, S, T.

Examples:
- ""APPLE"": A P P L E -> positions: A(1), P(2), P(3), L(4), E(5). This works, and P is not forbidden.
- ""AMPLE"": A M P L E -> M and P.
- ""ABLED"": but ends with D, not E? ""ABLE"" is 4 letters. ""ABLED"" is 5 but ends with D.
- ""ADDLE"": A D D L E -> D is allowed.
- ""ADOBE"": A D O B E -> but no L? We need L in position 4? This has B in position 4, not L.

We need L in position 4.

So words like: APPLE, AMPLE, ADDLE, AISLE (but S is absent), AGILE (G and I), etc.

But we must avoid S, so ""AISLE"" is out.

""ANKLE"": has N and K? N is absent.

""AXLE"": only 4 letters.

So possible words: APPLE, AMPLE, ADDLE.

But we also have to consider that we haven't tested many letters. We can use one of these to test.

However, we also know that L is in the word, and in this case, we are putting L in position 4. If it's correct, good. If not, then L must be in position 1 or 3? But we are assuming A is in position 1, so position 1 is taken, so L must be in position 3? But we couldn't find a word with L in position 3.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 4 and L in position 1 or 3, but we had difficulty finding words.

Another idea: perhaps the word has duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence yet.

We have only 6 tries, so we need to make progress.

Let's list the letters we know are in the word: A, E, L.

And we know E is at the end.

A is in position 1 or 4.

L is in the word, not in position 2, and not in the position of A.

Also, we have two positions left (if A is in 1, then positions 2,3,4 but one is L and two others; similarly if A is in 4, then positions 1,2,3 with one being L and two others).

But we have to fill the blanks with letters not in the absent list: absent are C, R, N, S, T.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try to guess a word that has A in position 1 and L in position 4, like ""APPLE"" or ""AMPLE"", but let's see what they test.

""APPLE"": 
- A in position 1: if correct, then we get a check. If not, then A is not in 1, so it must be in 4.
- L in position 4: if correct, then we get a check. If not, then L is not in 4, so it must be in 3 (since not in 2).
- Also, it tests P in position 2 and 3? But if we get feedback that P is absent, then we know P is not in the word.

Similarly, ""AMPLE"" tests M and P.

But we don't know if P or M are in the word.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't assume A's position but tests it explicitly.

For example, we can put A in position 4 in this guess to see if it's there. If we get a dash or check for A, we know.

Similarly for L, we can put it in a new position.

Let's try to put A in position 4 and L in position 1.

So pattern: L _ _ A E

We need to fill position 2 and 3.

Avoid C, R, N, S, T.

What words? ""LAMAE"" not a word. ""Lavae""? L A V A E -> A in position 2 and 4, but we know A is not in position 2, so we cannot put A in position 2. So position 2 cannot be A.

So L _ _ A E, position 2 must not be A and not L (already in 1).

Examples:
- ""LUCRE"": has R and C, absent.
- ""LAPSE"": has S and P, but S is absent.
- ""LARGE"": has R, absent.
- ""LATHE"": has T and H, but T is absent.
- ""LOAVE"": not common, and O and V? L O A V E -> but A is in position 3, not 4.

We need A in position 4.

""LILAE"": not a word.

""LIBRA"": no E.

It's very hard.

Perhaps ""LOAVE"" is sometimes accepted? But let's not use it.

Another idea: put A in position 1 and L in position 3, even though it's hard to find a word. What about ""AGLET""? But ends with T, absent, and T is out.

""AGLEY"": A G L E Y -> but only 5 letters? A(1), G(2), L(3), E(4), Y(5). But we need E at position 5, so this has E in position 4, not 5.

We need the fifth letter to be E.

So for A in position 1 and L in position 3: A _ L _ E

Fill position 2 and 4.

Position 2: avoid A, L, and absent letters.
Position 4: avoid absent letters.

Words:
- ""AISLE"": A I S L E -> but S is absent, and L is in position 4, not 3.
- ""AMBLE"": A M B L E -> L in position 4.
- ""ANKLE"": has N.
- ""APPLE"": L in position 4.
- ""AXILE"": L in position 4.

I found ""ADZHE"": not a word.

Perhaps ""ABLE L"" is not working.

Let's try a different approach. We know L is in the word and not in position 2, so let's put L in position 1 or 3 or 4.

We also know A is in 1 or 4.

So to test both, we can put A in position 4 and L in position 3.

Pattern: _ _ L A E

We need to fill position 1 and 2.

Avoid C, R, N, S, T.

What words? 
- ""BULAE"": B U L A E -> positions: B(1), U(2), L(3), A(4), E(5). This seems possible? But is ""BULAE"" a word? I think ""bula"" is not English. ""Bulla"" is but that's two L's.

""Bulla"" is 5 letters: B U L L A, not ending with E.

""FLAE"" not 5.

""PLUAE"" not word.

"" value"" but V A L U E, not the pattern.

Perhaps ""ILIAC"" without E.

I think we need to use a word that has A in position 1 and L in position 4, as we have examples like ""APPLE"", ""AMPLE"", ""ADDLE"".

Let's choose ""AMPLE"" because it has M and P, common letters.

So guess: ""AMPLE""

- A in position 1: will tell us if A is in 1 or not.
- M in position 2: new letter.
- P in position 3: new letter.
- L in position 4: will tell us if L is in 4 or not.
- E in position 5: correct.

If A is in position 1, we get a check; if not, we get a dash (but we know A is in the word, so if not in 1, then it must be in 4).

Similarly for L: if in position 4, check; if not, then L must be in position 3 (since not in 2).

Also, we test M and P.

So it's informative.

Therefore, I will guess ""AMPLE"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRANE**  
  - C (x): Not in the word.  
  - R (x): Not in the word.  
  - A (-): In the word but wrong position (not position 2).  
  - N (x): Not in the word.  
  - E (✓): Correct and in position 5.  

- **Guess 2: SLATE**  
  - S (x): Not in the word.  
  - L (-): In the word but wrong position (not position 2).  
  - A (-): In the word but wrong position (not position 3).  
  - T (x): Not in the word.  
  - E (✓): Correct and in position 5.  

### Key Insights
1. **E is fixed in position 5**.
2. **A is present** but not in positions 2 or 3. Since position 5 is E, A must be in position 1 or 4.
3. **L is present** but not in position 2.
4. **Absent letters**: C, R, N, S, T (cannot be used).
5. **Remaining letters to test**: Focus on common consonants/vowels not yet tried (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

### Strategy for Guess 3
- Test **A in position 1** and **L in position 4** to resolve their positions:
  - If A is in position 1, it will get ✓ (correct) or - (wrong position, confirming A must be in position 4).
  - If L is in position 4, it will get ✓ (correct) or - (wrong position, confirming L must be in position 3).
- Include new common letters (**M and P**) to gather more information.
- Avoid absent letters (C, R, N, S, T).

The word **""AMPLE""** fits perfectly:
- A in position 1 (tests if A is in position 1).
- M in position 2 (new letter test).
- P in position 3 (new letter test).
- L in position 4 (tests if L is in position 4).
- E in position 5 (fixed).

This guess efficiently narrows down the positions of A and L while testing two new common consonants (M and P).

<guess>ample</guess>",ample,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position, and specifically not in position 2)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct, in position 5)

Guess 2: ""slate""
- S: x (not in the word)
- L: - (in the word but wrong position; since it was in position 2, it's not there)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position; now we know it's not in position 2 or 3)
- T: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct, in position 5)

So, from both guesses, we know:

1. The word ends with E (position 5 is E).
2. The letter A is in the word, but not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 3 (from second guess). Since the word has 5 letters and position 5 is E, A must be in position 1 or 4.
3. The letter L is in the word, but not in position 2 (where we placed it in the second guess).
4. The following letters are absent: C, R, N, S, T.

We also have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, L, T. So we know A, E, L are present, and C, R, N, S, T are absent.

Now, we need to form a new guess that:
- Ends with E (position 5).
- Includes A in either position 1 or 4 (since it must be in one of these).
- Includes L, but not in position 2 (and we haven't tried L in other positions yet).
- Avoids C, R, N, S, T.

Additionally, we should try to test other common letters to uncover the remaining letters.

Since A can be in position 1 or 4, we can design a guess that tests one of these possibilities.

Let's consider the possibilities for A:

Option 1: A in position 1.
Then the word is A _ _ _ E.

Option 2: A in position 4.
Then the word is _ _ _ A E.

We also know L is present and not in position 2. So L could be in position 1, 3, or 4? But if A is in position 1, then L cannot be in 1 (unless it's the same letter, but they are different). Similarly, if A is in position 4, then L cannot be in 4. Also, we haven't tried L in position 1, 3, or 4.

We should also consider that there might be other letters we haven't tested. We have used 8 letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, L, T. The alphabet has 26, so many left.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to choose a word that fits the constraints and tests new letters.

Let's try to form a word for each case to test:

First, if we assume A is in position 1, then we have A _ _ _ E. We need to fill the middle three positions. We know L is in the word, so one of the middle three must be L (but not position 2, so position 3 or 4? But position 4 is the third blank? Let me index:

Position 1: A
Position 2: ? (cannot be L, because we tried L in position 2 and it was wrong, and also not A because we know A is not in position 2)
Position 3: ?
Position 4: ?
Position 5: E

But note: we also know that L is in the word and not in position 2. So L must be in position 3 or 4? But position 4 is the fourth character. Also, we have to avoid S, T, C, R, N.

Possible words: 
- A _ L _ E -> but we need to fill position 2 and 4. And we know L is in position 3? Then we have A ? L ? E. But we don't know if L is in position 3.

Alternatively, we can try to put L in position 3 to test it.

But we don't have to fix the position of A in this guess. We can choose a word that tests A in position 4, for example.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in position 4 and L in a new position (like position 1 or 3) to test both.

Let me think of words that end with E, have A in position 4, and L in the word (but not position 2), and avoid C, R, N, S, T.

For example: 
- _ _ _ A E, and the word must contain L.

Some words: 
- ""BLARE"" -> but has R (absent) and we avoid R.
- ""FLAME"" -> F L A M E: but L is in position 2? We know L is not in position 2, so we cannot put L in position 2. Also, we are testing A in position 3? No, in ""FLAME"", A is in position 3? Let's see: F(1), L(2), A(3), M(4), E(5). But we want A in position 4? Then this is not.

We need A in position 4: so the fourth letter is A.

Example: ""OVALE""? Not a word. 
""LOCAE""? Not common.

How about ""GLAZE"": G L A Z E -> A is in position 3, not 4.

We need the fourth letter to be A: so pattern: _ _ _ A E.

Words: 
- ""PULSE"" -> but has S (absent) and U, L, but L is in position 2? P(1), U(2), L(3), S(4), E(5) -> no, A is not present.

We need a word that has A in the fourth position and E at the end, and also contains L (somewhere not position 2).

For example: 
- ""VIALE"": V I A L E -> A is in position 3, not 4.
- ""DANCE"": has C and N, absent.
- ""FABLE"": F A B L E -> A is in position 2, but we know A is not in position 2? And also, we are avoiding? F(1), A(2), B(3), L(4), E(5). But we know A is not in position 2, so this is invalid because we are putting A in position 2? We cannot put A in position 2 because we know it's not there.

We must not put A in position 2 or 3 (from feedback). So in the new guess, we can put A in position 1 or 4.

Similarly, we must not put L in position 2.

So for a word with A in position 4: _ _ _ A E, and L must be in position 1 or 3 (since position 2 is forbidden for L, and position 4 is A, so L cannot be there).

So possibilities:
- L in position 1: L _ _ A E
- L in position 3: _ _ L A E

Now, let's find words that fit:

Option 1: L in position 1: L _ _ A E
- We need to fill position 2 and 3, avoiding C, R, N, S, T, and also the letter in position 2 cannot be L (but L is already in 1) and cannot be A (but A is in 4). Also, the word must be valid.

Possible words: 
- ""LEAVE"": L E A V E -> but E is in position 2? And we have E at the end, but the word has two E's? Also, A is in position 3, not 4. We need A in position 4. So not.
- ""LOAVE"": not a common word? And A is in position 3? L O A V E -> A in 3.
- ""LAMAE"": not a word.

It's hard to find a word with A in position 4 and starting with L.

Option 2: L in position 3: _ _ L A E
- So pattern: ? ? L A E

We need to fill positions 1 and 2, avoiding C, R, N, S, T, and the letters must be from the remaining alphabet.

Possible words:
- ""BLAZE"": B L A Z E -> but L is in position 2? We have L in position 2, which we know is wrong. We cannot put L in position 2. In this pattern, we are putting L in position 3, so position 2 is a different letter.

In the pattern _ _ L A E, position 2 is the second letter, and we are not putting L there. We are putting L in position 3.

So:
Position 1: ?
Position 2: ? (cannot be L, and cannot be A because A is not in position 2, and also avoid C, R, N, S, T)
Position 3: L
Position 4: A
Position 5: E

Now, what words fit this pattern? And are valid English words.

Examples:
- ""ABLE"": only 4 letters.
- We need 5 letters: so ""??LAE""

Possible words:
- ""GLAZE"": G L A Z E -> but here L is in position 2, not 3. We need L in position 3. So not.
- ""PLACE"": P L A C E -> L in position 2, and C is absent. Not.
- ""FLAME"": F L A M E -> L in position 2. Not.

How about ""ILIAC""? I L I A C -> but C is absent, and also pattern is I(1), L(2), I(3), A(4), C(5) -> but we need E at the end? No, we need E at the end.

We need the word to end with E.

So: _ _ L A E

Words: 
- ""Kylae""? Not a word.
- ""ULNAE"": U L N A E -> but L is in position 2 (forbidden) and N is absent.
- ""ELVAE"": E L V A E -> L in position 2? E(1), L(2), V(3), A(4), E(5). But we cannot have L in position 2.

It's difficult to find a word with L in position 3 and A in position 4 and E at the end.

Alternatively, we can try the other case: A in position 1.

So pattern: A _ _ _ E

And L is in the word, not in position 2, so in position 3 or 4.

Also, avoid C, R, N, S, T.

So:
- If L in position 3: A _ L _ E
- If L in position 4: A _ _ L E

Now, let's find words.

First, A _ L _ E:
- We need to fill position 2 and 4, avoiding forbidden letters.

Position 2: cannot be L (already in 3), cannot be A (duplicate? but we don't know if A is duplicated, but we have A in 1, so position 2 is different). Also avoid C, R, N, S, T.

Position 4: similarly.

Possible words:
- ""APPLE"": A P P L E -> but L is in position 4, not 3. We are looking for L in position 3? In ""APPLE"": A(1), P(2), P(3), L(4), E(5). So L is in position 4.

We need L in position 3 for this subcase.

So A _ L _ E, with L in position 3.

Examples:
- ""AMBLE"": A M B L E -> L is in position 4? A(1), M(2), B(3), L(4), E(5). Not position 3.
- ""ADDLE"": A D D L E -> L in position 4.
- ""AGILE"": A G I L E -> L in position 4.

I'm having trouble finding a word with L in position 3.

How about ""AXILE"": A X I L E -> L in position 4.

""ANILE"": has N, absent.

""ALIKE"": A L I K E -> L in position 2, which is forbidden.

Perhaps ""AISLE"": A I S L E -> but S is absent, and L is in position 4.

It seems hard to find a word with L in position 3.

Now, the other subcase: A _ _ L E, with L in position 4.

Pattern: A ? ? L E

We need to fill position 2 and 3, avoiding C, R, N, S, T.

Examples:
- ""APPLE"": A P P L E -> positions: A(1), P(2), P(3), L(4), E(5). This works, and P is not forbidden.
- ""AMPLE"": A M P L E -> M and P.
- ""ABLED"": but ends with D, not E? ""ABLE"" is 4 letters. ""ABLED"" is 5 but ends with D.
- ""ADDLE"": A D D L E -> D is allowed.
- ""ADOBE"": A D O B E -> but no L? We need L in position 4? This has B in position 4, not L.

We need L in position 4.

So words like: APPLE, AMPLE, ADDLE, AISLE (but S is absent), AGILE (G and I), etc.

But we must avoid S, so ""AISLE"" is out.

""ANKLE"": has N and K? N is absent.

""AXLE"": only 4 letters.

So possible words: APPLE, AMPLE, ADDLE.

But we also have to consider that we haven't tested many letters. We can use one of these to test.

However, we also know that L is in the word, and in this case, we are putting L in position 4. If it's correct, good. If not, then L must be in position 1 or 3? But we are assuming A is in position 1, so position 1 is taken, so L must be in position 3? But we couldn't find a word with L in position 3.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 4 and L in position 1 or 3, but we had difficulty finding words.

Another idea: perhaps the word has duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence yet.

We have only 6 tries, so we need to make progress.

Let's list the letters we know are in the word: A, E, L.

And we know E is at the end.

A is in position 1 or 4.

L is in the word, not in position 2, and not in the position of A.

Also, we have two positions left (if A is in 1, then positions 2,3,4 but one is L and two others; similarly if A is in 4, then positions 1,2,3 with one being L and two others).

But we have to fill the blanks with letters not in the absent list: absent are C, R, N, S, T.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try to guess a word that has A in position 1 and L in position 4, like ""APPLE"" or ""AMPLE"", but let's see what they test.

""APPLE"": 
- A in position 1: if correct, then we get a check. If not, then A is not in 1, so it must be in 4.
- L in position 4: if correct, then we get a check. If not, then L is not in 4, so it must be in 3 (since not in 2).
- Also, it tests P in position 2 and 3? But if we get feedback that P is absent, then we know P is not in the word.

Similarly, ""AMPLE"" tests M and P.

But we don't know if P or M are in the word.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't assume A's position but tests it explicitly.

For example, we can put A in position 4 in this guess to see if it's there. If we get a dash or check for A, we know.

Similarly for L, we can put it in a new position.

Let's try to put A in position 4 and L in position 1.

So pattern: L _ _ A E

We need to fill position 2 and 3.

Avoid C, R, N, S, T.

What words? ""LAMAE"" not a word. ""Lavae""? L A V A E -> A in position 2 and 4, but we know A is not in position 2, so we cannot put A in position 2. So position 2 cannot be A.

So L _ _ A E, position 2 must not be A and not L (already in 1).

Examples:
- ""LUCRE"": has R and C, absent.
- ""LAPSE"": has S and P, but S is absent.
- ""LARGE"": has R, absent.
- ""LATHE"": has T and H, but T is absent.
- ""LOAVE"": not common, and O and V? L O A V E -> but A is in position 3, not 4.

We need A in position 4.

""LILAE"": not a word.

""LIBRA"": no E.

It's very hard.

Perhaps ""LOAVE"" is sometimes accepted? But let's not use it.

Another idea: put A in position 1 and L in position 3, even though it's hard to find a word. What about ""AGLET""? But ends with T, absent, and T is out.

""AGLEY"": A G L E Y -> but only 5 letters? A(1), G(2), L(3), E(4), Y(5). But we need E at position 5, so this has E in position 4, not 5.

We need the fifth letter to be E.

So for A in position 1 and L in position 3: A _ L _ E

Fill position 2 and 4.

Position 2: avoid A, L, and absent letters.
Position 4: avoid absent letters.

Words:
- ""AISLE"": A I S L E -> but S is absent, and L is in position 4, not 3.
- ""AMBLE"": A M B L E -> L in position 4.
- ""ANKLE"": has N.
- ""APPLE"": L in position 4.
- ""AXILE"": L in position 4.

I found ""ADZHE"": not a word.

Perhaps ""ABLE L"" is not working.

Let's try a different approach. We know L is in the word and not in position 2, so let's put L in position 1 or 3 or 4.

We also know A is in 1 or 4.

So to test both, we can put A in position 4 and L in position 3.

Pattern: _ _ L A E

We need to fill position 1 and 2.

Avoid C, R, N, S, T.

What words? 
- ""BULAE"": B U L A E -> positions: B(1), U(2), L(3), A(4), E(5). This seems possible? But is ""BULAE"" a word? I think ""bula"" is not English. ""Bulla"" is but that's two L's.

""Bulla"" is 5 letters: B U L L A, not ending with E.

""FLAE"" not 5.

""PLUAE"" not word.

"" value"" but V A L U E, not the pattern.

Perhaps ""ILIAC"" without E.

I think we need to use a word that has A in position 1 and L in position 4, as we have examples like ""APPLE"", ""AMPLE"", ""ADDLE"".

Let's choose ""AMPLE"" because it has M and P, common letters.

So guess: ""AMPLE""

- A in position 1: will tell us if A is in 1 or not.
- M in position 2: new letter.
- P in position 3: new letter.
- L in position 4: will tell us if L is in 4 or not.
- E in position 5: correct.

If A is in position 1, we get a check; if not, we get a dash (but we know A is in the word, so if not in 1, then it must be in 4).

Similarly for L: if in position 4, check; if not, then L must be in position 3 (since not in 2).

Also, we test M and P.

So it's informative.

Therefore, I will guess ""AMPLE"".

<guess>ample</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRANE**  
  - C (x): Not in the word.  
  - R (x): Not in the word.  
  - A (-): In the word but wrong position (not position 2).  
  - N (x): Not in the word.  
  - E (✓): Correct and in position 5.  

- **Guess 2: SLATE**  
  - S (x): Not in the word.  
  - L (-): In the word but wrong position (not position 2).  
  - A (-): In the word but wrong position (not position 3).  
  - T (x): Not in the word.  
  - E (✓): Correct and in position 5.  

### Key Insights
1. **E is fixed in position 5**.
2. **A is present** but not in positions 2 or 3. Since position 5 is E, A must be in position 1 or 4.
3. **L is present** but not in position 2.
4. **Absent letters**: C, R, N, S, T (cannot be used).
5. **Remaining letters to test**: Focus on common consonants/vowels not yet tried (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

### Strategy for Guess 3
- Test **A in position 1** and **L in position 4** to resolve their positions:
  - If A is in position 1, it will get ✓ (correct) or - (wrong position, confirming A must be in position 4).
  - If L is in position 4, it will get ✓ (correct) or - (wrong position, confirming L must be in position 3).
- Include new common letters (**M and P**) to gather more information.
- Avoid absent letters (C, R, N, S, T).

The word **""AMPLE""** fits perfectly:
- A in position 1 (tests if A is in position 1).
- M in position 2 (new letter test).
- P in position 3 (new letter test).
- L in position 4 (tests if L is in position 4).
- E in position 5 (fixed).

This guess efficiently narrows down the positions of A and L while testing two new common consonants (M and P).",Guess 3: ample -> FEEDBACK: A(-) M(x) P(x) L(✓) E(✓),FAIL

 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the last letter and in the 5th position)

 Therefore, we know:
 - The word ends with E (5th letter is E).
 - The letter A is in the word but not in the 2nd position (since we guessed A in the 2nd position and it was marked as wrong position).
 - The letters C, R, and N are not in the word.

 Since the word has an A and an E, and we know the E is at the end, we can try to form a new guess.

 Important: We must avoid using C, R, N (since they are not in the word) and we know A is present but not in the 2nd position.

 We have 6 tries, so we can use this information to make a second guess.

 We also know the word is 5 letters and the last letter is E.

 Let's think of words that end with E and contain A (but not in the second position) and without C, R, N.

 We can also try to include other common letters to test.

 Since A is in the word but not in position 2, it could be in position 1, 3, 4? But note: we have the 5th as E, so A cannot be in 5th.

 Possibilities for A: positions 1, 3, or 4.

 We also don't know the other letters. We should try to cover more common consonants.

 Let's avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, N.

 Common consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We also know that the word has at least two vowels? Not necessarily, but we have A and E.

 We can try a word that has A in a different position and also tests other common letters.

 Example: We can try to put A in the first position? But note, we don't know if A is in the first. Alternatively, we can put A in the third or fourth.

 Let's try to use a word that has A in the 3rd position and also includes other common letters.

 But note: we also want to test for other vowels? We already have E, and we know the word has A. The word might have more vowels? Or not.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in the 4th position? 

 However, we must remember that we have only 5 positions and the last is E.

 Let me think of words ending with E and containing A (not in the 2nd) and without C, R, N.

 Some possibilities: 
 - ...A.E -> but the A would be in the 4th? Then the word would be ? ? ? A E. But we don't know the first three.

 We can try to use a word that has A in the 1st position? For example: A _ _ _ E. But we don't know the middle.

 But note: we have to avoid C, R, N.

 Let me list some words that fit:
 - ABASE: ends with E, has A in first and fourth? But we don't know if A is repeated? The feedback for the first guess only showed one A, but there could be more? We don't know.

 However, in our first guess, we had A in the second position and it was marked as present but wrong. The word might have only one A? Or more? We don't know.

 But note: the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates unless we guess duplicates. So we have to be cautious.

 Since we are limited by the absent letters (C, R, N) and the known present letters (A, E) and the position of E (5th), we can try:

 Let's try the word ""SAUTE"". 
 - S: test a common letter
 - A: in the second position? But wait, we know A is not in the second position? Actually, no: the feedback said A was in the word but not in the second position. So we should avoid putting A in the second position again.

 Therefore, in our new guess, we should put A in a different position: either 1, 3, or 4.

 But note: we also want to test other letters.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in the first position: e.g., ""ADOBE"" -> but that has O and B and D. However, we don't know if O is present? Also, note that we have to avoid R and C and N? ""ADOBE"" has no R, C, N. But we have to check: A (1st), D (2nd), O (3rd), B (4th), E (5th). 

 But wait, we know that the 5th is E, so that's fixed. So we can try:

 However, we also have the constraint that A is present and not in the 2nd. Putting A in the 1st is acceptable.

 But let me see: if we try ""ADOBE"", then:
 - A: if the word has A in the first, then it would be marked as correct? But if not, then it might be marked as present or absent.

 However, we don't know if the word has A in the first. We only know that A is in the word and not in the second.

 Alternatively, we can try to put A in the 3rd or 4th.

 Another idea: we can try to use a word that has A in the 4th position? For example: ""PLATE"" -> but we have to avoid R? Wait, ""PLATE"" has T and L and P, but also note: we don't know if T, L, P are present. However, we must avoid R? But ""PLATE"" doesn't have R? Actually, it doesn't. But we also must avoid C and N? ""PLATE"" has no C, R, N.

 But wait: we have to consider the feedback for the first guess: we had A in the second position and it was marked as present but wrong. So if we put A in the 4th in ""PLATE"", that would be a new position.

 However, note that ""PLATE"" has the E at the end, which is correct. And the A is in the 4th? Actually, in ""PLATE"": 
 P L A T E -> A is in the 3rd position, not 4th.

 Let me break down ""PLATE"":
 Position 1: P
 Position 2: L
 Position 3: A
 Position 4: T
 Position 5: E

 So A is in the 3rd.

 That's acceptable because we haven't tried A in the 3rd.

 But note: we also have to test other letters. We want to maximize information.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in the 1st and also tests other common letters? 

 Let me think of words that end with E and have A in the 1st, without C, R, N:
 - ABASE: A B A S E -> but has two A's? We don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we are using A twice, which might not be efficient for testing new letters.
 - AGATE: A G A T E -> again two A's.
 - ALATE: A L A T E -> two A's.

 How about words with A in the 1st and without repeating A?
 - ABLE: only 4 letters? Not 5.
 - AWAKE: A W A K E -> two A's.
 - AZURE: A Z U R E -> but R is not allowed (we know R is absent).

 We must avoid R.

 How about ""AFIRE""? But has R -> not allowed.

 How about ""AMUSE"": A M U S E -> no R, C, N. And only one A? Actually, it has A and then U, S, E.

 So ""AMUSE"": 
 A (1st), M (2nd), U (3rd), S (4th), E (5th)

 This tests:
 - A in the first position: if it's correct, we get a check. If not, but if the word has A and it's in the first, then it would be correct? Actually, if the word has A in the first, then we get a check. If the word has A but not in the first, then we get a dash? But we know A is in the word, so if we put A in the first and it's not the correct position, then we get a dash? But we also know that the word has A and it's not in the second. So if we put it in the first, we might get either check or dash.

 Alternatively, we can try to put A in the 3rd or 4th to see if it's there.

 Since we don't have much information, we can try to cover more common consonants.

 Another common starting approach is to use a word that has the known letters (A and E) and then test other common consonants (like T, L, S, etc.) without the forbidden letters.

 Let me try to form a word that has:
 - E at the end (fixed)
 - A in a new position (not 2nd) and not the 5th (which is E) so either 1, 3, or 4.
 - and includes T, L, S, or other common letters.

 Example: ""SLATE"" -> S L A T E
 - S: test S
 - L: test L
 - A: in the 3rd position (which we haven't tried)
 - T: test T
 - E: at the end (correct)

 But note: we must avoid R, C, N? ""SLATE"" has no R, C, N.

 However, we already tried the letter A in the second position and it was present but wrong. Now we are trying A in the third. This is a good test.

 Alternatively, we can try ""PLATE"" (as I thought earlier) which is similar: P L A T E.

 But which one? Both are valid. Let's choose one that has more common letters.

 We haven't tested S, L, T, P, etc.

 Since we want to test as many new letters as possible, we can choose a word that doesn't repeat the letters we already know are absent.

 We know C, R, N are absent. So we can use any other letters.

 I think ""SLATE"" is a good choice because it has S, L, T which are very common.

 But note: we also have the E at the end, which we know is correct. So we are testing the first four letters.

 However, we must be cautious: if the word has duplicate letters, we might get unexpected feedback. But we don't have any duplicate in ""SLATE"".

 So let's go with ""SLATE"".

 But wait: what if the word has A in the first position? Then by putting A in the third, we might not get the A in the first. But that's okay because we are testing.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in the first and also tests other letters? But we don't have a good candidate without R, C, N and without repeating A.

 I think ""SLATE"" is a reasonable second guess.

 Let me write it: S L A T E

 But note: the word is 5 letters, so ""SLATE"" is 5 letters.

 However, we must make sure that we are not using any forbidden letters: no C, R, N. ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E -> no C, R, N. Good.

 So I will guess ""SLATE"".

 But wait: we have the feedback that in the first guess, the letter E was in the correct position (5th). So in ""SLATE"", we are putting E at the 5th, which is correct. That will be a check.

 The other positions: 
 - S at 1st: we don't know if it's present or not.
 - L at 2nd: same.
 - A at 3rd: we know A is in the word, but we don't know if it's in the 3rd.
 - T at 4th: we don't know.

 This guess will help us locate A and also test S, L, T.

 Therefore, I choose ""SLATE"".

 However, note: we have to consider that the word might have the letter A in the 4th? Then we are not testing the 4th with A. But we are testing T in the 4th. If we get feedback that A is still not in the 3rd, then we know it must be in the 1st or 4th? But we are testing the 3rd. If the A is in the 4th, then in this guess the A would be in the 3rd and marked as absent? No, wait: the feedback for A would be: if the word has A and it's in the 4th, then when we put A in the 3rd, it would be marked as present but wrong (dash). Because the A is in the word but not in the 3rd.

 So we can still get information.

 Alternatively, if we get a dash for A, then we know A is not in the 3rd, so it must be in the 1st or 4th.

 And if we get a check for A, then we know it's in the 3rd.

 So it's a good test.

 Therefore, I will go with ""SLATE"".

 But note: we have to avoid using the same letter in the same position if we know it's wrong? We don't have that for A because we only tried position 2 and now we are trying 3.

 So, second guess: ""SLATE""

<guess>slate</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, N** are absent (marked ""x"").
- **A** is present but not in the 2nd position (marked ""-"").
- **E** is correct and in the 5th position (marked ""✓"").

For the second guess:
- The word must end with **E** (5th letter).
- **A** must be included but not in the 2nd position (so positions 1, 3, or 4 are candidates).
- Avoid **C, R, N** entirely.
- Test new common consonants (e.g., **S, L, T**) to gather more information.

The word **""SLATE""** fits these criteria:
- Ends with **E** (correct position).
- Places **A** in the 3rd position (a new position to test).
- Uses **S, L, T** (common letters not yet tested).
- Excludes forbidden letters (C, R, N).

This guess will help identify the position of **A** and test **S, L, T** efficiently.

<guess>slate</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position, and specifically not in position 2)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct, in position 5)

Guess 2: ""slate""
- S: x (not in the word)
- L: - (in the word but wrong position; since it was in position 2, it's not there)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position; now we know it's not in position 2 or 3)
- T: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct, in position 5)

So, from both guesses, we know:

1. The word ends with E (position 5 is E).
2. The letter A is in the word, but not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 3 (from second guess). Since the word has 5 letters and position 5 is E, A must be in position 1 or 4.
3. The letter L is in the word, but not in position 2 (where we placed it in the second guess).
4. The following letters are absent: C, R, N, S, T.

We also have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, L, T. So we know A, E, L are present, and C, R, N, S, T are absent.

Now, we need to form a new guess that:
- Ends with E (position 5).
- Includes A in either position 1 or 4 (since it must be in one of these).
- Includes L, but not in position 2 (and we haven't tried L in other positions yet).
- Avoids C, R, N, S, T.

Additionally, we should try to test other common letters to uncover the remaining letters.

Since A can be in position 1 or 4, we can design a guess that tests one of these possibilities.

Let's consider the possibilities for A:

Option 1: A in position 1.
Then the word is A _ _ _ E.

Option 2: A in position 4.
Then the word is _ _ _ A E.

We also know L is present and not in position 2. So L could be in position 1, 3, or 4? But if A is in position 1, then L cannot be in 1 (unless it's the same letter, but they are different). Similarly, if A is in position 4, then L cannot be in 4. Also, we haven't tried L in position 1, 3, or 4.

We should also consider that there might be other letters we haven't tested. We have used 8 letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, L, T. The alphabet has 26, so many left.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to choose a word that fits the constraints and tests new letters.

Let's try to form a word for each case to test:

First, if we assume A is in position 1, then we have A _ _ _ E. We need to fill the middle three positions. We know L is in the word, so one of the middle three must be L (but not position 2, so position 3 or 4? But position 4 is the third blank? Let me index:

Position 1: A
Position 2: ? (cannot be L, because we tried L in position 2 and it was wrong, and also not A because we know A is not in position 2)
Position 3: ?
Position 4: ?
Position 5: E

But note: we also know that L is in the word and not in position 2. So L must be in position 3 or 4? But position 4 is the fourth character. Also, we have to avoid S, T, C, R, N.

Possible words: 
- A _ L _ E -> but we need to fill position 2 and 4. And we know L is in position 3? Then we have A ? L ? E. But we don't know if L is in position 3.

Alternatively, we can try to put L in position 3 to test it.

But we don't have to fix the position of A in this guess. We can choose a word that tests A in position 4, for example.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in position 4 and L in a new position (like position 1 or 3) to test both.

Let me think of words that end with E, have A in position 4, and L in the word (but not position 2), and avoid C, R, N, S, T.

For example: 
- _ _ _ A E, and the word must contain L.

Some words: 
- ""BLARE"" -> but has R (absent) and we avoid R.
- ""FLAME"" -> F L A M E: but L is in position 2? We know L is not in position 2, so we cannot put L in position 2. Also, we are testing A in position 3? No, in ""FLAME"", A is in position 3? Let's see: F(1), L(2), A(3), M(4), E(5). But we want A in position 4? Then this is not.

We need A in position 4: so the fourth letter is A.

Example: ""OVALE""? Not a word. 
""LOCAE""? Not common.

How about ""GLAZE"": G L A Z E -> A is in position 3, not 4.

We need the fourth letter to be A: so pattern: _ _ _ A E.

Words: 
- ""PULSE"" -> but has S (absent) and U, L, but L is in position 2? P(1), U(2), L(3), S(4), E(5) -> no, A is not present.

We need a word that has A in the fourth position and E at the end, and also contains L (somewhere not position 2).

For example: 
- ""VIALE"": V I A L E -> A is in position 3, not 4.
- ""DANCE"": has C and N, absent.
- ""FABLE"": F A B L E -> A is in position 2, but we know A is not in position 2? And also, we are avoiding? F(1), A(2), B(3), L(4), E(5). But we know A is not in position 2, so this is invalid because we are putting A in position 2? We cannot put A in position 2 because we know it's not there.

We must not put A in position 2 or 3 (from feedback). So in the new guess, we can put A in position 1 or 4.

Similarly, we must not put L in position 2.

So for a word with A in position 4: _ _ _ A E, and L must be in position 1 or 3 (since position 2 is forbidden for L, and position 4 is A, so L cannot be there).

So possibilities:
- L in position 1: L _ _ A E
- L in position 3: _ _ L A E

Now, let's find words that fit:

Option 1: L in position 1: L _ _ A E
- We need to fill position 2 and 3, avoiding C, R, N, S, T, and also the letter in position 2 cannot be L (but L is already in 1) and cannot be A (but A is in 4). Also, the word must be valid.

Possible words: 
- ""LEAVE"": L E A V E -> but E is in position 2? And we have E at the end, but the word has two E's? Also, A is in position 3, not 4. We need A in position 4. So not.
- ""LOAVE"": not a common word? And A is in position 3? L O A V E -> A in 3.
- ""LAMAE"": not a word.

It's hard to find a word with A in position 4 and starting with L.

Option 2: L in position 3: _ _ L A E
- So pattern: ? ? L A E

We need to fill positions 1 and 2, avoiding C, R, N, S, T, and the letters must be from the remaining alphabet.

Possible words:
- ""BLAZE"": B L A Z E -> but L is in position 2? We have L in position 2, which we know is wrong. We cannot put L in position 2. In this pattern, we are putting L in position 3, so position 2 is a different letter.

In the pattern _ _ L A E, position 2 is the second letter, and we are not putting L there. We are putting L in position 3.

So:
Position 1: ?
Position 2: ? (cannot be L, and cannot be A because A is not in position 2, and also avoid C, R, N, S, T)
Position 3: L
Position 4: A
Position 5: E

Now, what words fit this pattern? And are valid English words.

Examples:
- ""ABLE"": only 4 letters.
- We need 5 letters: so ""??LAE""

Possible words:
- ""GLAZE"": G L A Z E -> but here L is in position 2, not 3. We need L in position 3. So not.
- ""PLACE"": P L A C E -> L in position 2, and C is absent. Not.
- ""FLAME"": F L A M E -> L in position 2. Not.

How about ""ILIAC""? I L I A C -> but C is absent, and also pattern is I(1), L(2), I(3), A(4), C(5) -> but we need E at the end? No, we need E at the end.

We need the word to end with E.

So: _ _ L A E

Words: 
- ""Kylae""? Not a word.
- ""ULNAE"": U L N A E -> but L is in position 2 (forbidden) and N is absent.
- ""ELVAE"": E L V A E -> L in position 2? E(1), L(2), V(3), A(4), E(5). But we cannot have L in position 2.

It's difficult to find a word with L in position 3 and A in position 4 and E at the end.

Alternatively, we can try the other case: A in position 1.

So pattern: A _ _ _ E

And L is in the word, not in position 2, so in position 3 or 4.

Also, avoid C, R, N, S, T.

So:
- If L in position 3: A _ L _ E
- If L in position 4: A _ _ L E

Now, let's find words.

First, A _ L _ E:
- We need to fill position 2 and 4, avoiding forbidden letters.

Position 2: cannot be L (already in 3), cannot be A (duplicate? but we don't know if A is duplicated, but we have A in 1, so position 2 is different). Also avoid C, R, N, S, T.

Position 4: similarly.

Possible words:
- ""APPLE"": A P P L E -> but L is in position 4, not 3. We are looking for L in position 3? In ""APPLE"": A(1), P(2), P(3), L(4), E(5). So L is in position 4.

We need L in position 3 for this subcase.

So A _ L _ E, with L in position 3.

Examples:
- ""AMBLE"": A M B L E -> L is in position 4? A(1), M(2), B(3), L(4), E(5). Not position 3.
- ""ADDLE"": A D D L E -> L in position 4.
- ""AGILE"": A G I L E -> L in position 4.

I'm having trouble finding a word with L in position 3.

How about ""AXILE"": A X I L E -> L in position 4.

""ANILE"": has N, absent.

""ALIKE"": A L I K E -> L in position 2, which is forbidden.

Perhaps ""AISLE"": A I S L E -> but S is absent, and L is in position 4.

It seems hard to find a word with L in position 3.

Now, the other subcase: A _ _ L E, with L in position 4.

Pattern: A ? ? L E

We need to fill position 2 and 3, avoiding C, R, N, S, T.

Examples:
- ""APPLE"": A P P L E -> positions: A(1), P(2), P(3), L(4), E(5). This works, and P is not forbidden.
- ""AMPLE"": A M P L E -> M and P.
- ""ABLED"": but ends with D, not E? ""ABLE"" is 4 letters. ""ABLED"" is 5 but ends with D.
- ""ADDLE"": A D D L E -> D is allowed.
- ""ADOBE"": A D O B E -> but no L? We need L in position 4? This has B in position 4, not L.

We need L in position 4.

So words like: APPLE, AMPLE, ADDLE, AISLE (but S is absent), AGILE (G and I), etc.

But we must avoid S, so ""AISLE"" is out.

""ANKLE"": has N and K? N is absent.

""AXLE"": only 4 letters.

So possible words: APPLE, AMPLE, ADDLE.

But we also have to consider that we haven't tested many letters. We can use one of these to test.

However, we also know that L is in the word, and in this case, we are putting L in position 4. If it's correct, good. If not, then L must be in position 1 or 3? But we are assuming A is in position 1, so position 1 is taken, so L must be in position 3? But we couldn't find a word with L in position 3.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 4 and L in position 1 or 3, but we had difficulty finding words.

Another idea: perhaps the word has duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence yet.

We have only 6 tries, so we need to make progress.

Let's list the letters we know are in the word: A, E, L.

And we know E is at the end.

A is in position 1 or 4.

L is in the word, not in position 2, and not in the position of A.

Also, we have two positions left (if A is in 1, then positions 2,3,4 but one is L and two others; similarly if A is in 4, then positions 1,2,3 with one being L and two others).

But we have to fill the blanks with letters not in the absent list: absent are C, R, N, S, T.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try to guess a word that has A in position 1 and L in position 4, like ""APPLE"" or ""AMPLE"", but let's see what they test.

""APPLE"": 
- A in position 1: if correct, then we get a check. If not, then A is not in 1, so it must be in 4.
- L in position 4: if correct, then we get a check. If not, then L is not in 4, so it must be in 3 (since not in 2).
- Also, it tests P in position 2 and 3? But if we get feedback that P is absent, then we know P is not in the word.

Similarly, ""AMPLE"" tests M and P.

But we don't know if P or M are in the word.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't assume A's position but tests it explicitly.

For example, we can put A in position 4 in this guess to see if it's there. If we get a dash or check for A, we know.

Similarly for L, we can put it in a new position.

Let's try to put A in position 4 and L in position 1.

So pattern: L _ _ A E

We need to fill position 2 and 3.

Avoid C, R, N, S, T.

What words? ""LAMAE"" not a word. ""Lavae""? L A V A E -> A in position 2 and 4, but we know A is not in position 2, so we cannot put A in position 2. So position 2 cannot be A.

So L _ _ A E, position 2 must not be A and not L (already in 1).

Examples:
- ""LUCRE"": has R and C, absent.
- ""LAPSE"": has S and P, but S is absent.
- ""LARGE"": has R, absent.
- ""LATHE"": has T and H, but T is absent.
- ""LOAVE"": not common, and O and V? L O A V E -> but A is in position 3, not 4.

We need A in position 4.

""LILAE"": not a word.

""LIBRA"": no E.

It's very hard.

Perhaps ""LOAVE"" is sometimes accepted? But let's not use it.

Another idea: put A in position 1 and L in position 3, even though it's hard to find a word. What about ""AGLET""? But ends with T, absent, and T is out.

""AGLEY"": A G L E Y -> but only 5 letters? A(1), G(2), L(3), E(4), Y(5). But we need E at position 5, so this has E in position 4, not 5.

We need the fifth letter to be E.

So for A in position 1 and L in position 3: A _ L _ E

Fill position 2 and 4.

Position 2: avoid A, L, and absent letters.
Position 4: avoid absent letters.

Words:
- ""AISLE"": A I S L E -> but S is absent, and L is in position 4, not 3.
- ""AMBLE"": A M B L E -> L in position 4.
- ""ANKLE"": has N.
- ""APPLE"": L in position 4.
- ""AXILE"": L in position 4.

I found ""ADZHE"": not a word.

Perhaps ""ABLE L"" is not working.

Let's try a different approach. We know L is in the word and not in position 2, so let's put L in position 1 or 3 or 4.

We also know A is in 1 or 4.

So to test both, we can put A in position 4 and L in position 3.

Pattern: _ _ L A E

We need to fill position 1 and 2.

Avoid C, R, N, S, T.

What words? 
- ""BULAE"": B U L A E -> positions: B(1), U(2), L(3), A(4), E(5). This seems possible? But is ""BULAE"" a word? I think ""bula"" is not English. ""Bulla"" is but that's two L's.

""Bulla"" is 5 letters: B U L L A, not ending with E.

""FLAE"" not 5.

""PLUAE"" not word.

"" value"" but V A L U E, not the pattern.

Perhaps ""ILIAC"" without E.

I think we need to use a word that has A in position 1 and L in position 4, as we have examples like ""APPLE"", ""AMPLE"", ""ADDLE"".

Let's choose ""AMPLE"" because it has M and P, common letters.

So guess: ""AMPLE""

- A in position 1: will tell us if A is in 1 or not.
- M in position 2: new letter.
- P in position 3: new letter.
- L in position 4: will tell us if L is in 4 or not.
- E in position 5: correct.

If A is in position 1, we get a check; if not, we get a dash (but we know A is in the word, so if not in 1, then it must be in 4).

Similarly for L: if in position 4, check; if not, then L must be in position 3 (since not in 2).

Also, we test M and P.

So it's informative.

Therefore, I will guess ""AMPLE"".

<guess>ample</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRANE**  
  - C (x): Not in the word.  
  - R (x): Not in the word.  
  - A (-): In the word but wrong position (not position 2).  
  - N (x): Not in the word.  
  - E (✓): Correct and in position 5.  

- **Guess 2: SLATE**  
  - S (x): Not in the word.  
  - L (-): In the word but wrong position (not position 2).  
  - A (-): In the word but wrong position (not position 3).  
  - T (x): Not in the word.  
  - E (✓): Correct and in position 5.  

### Key Insights
1. **E is fixed in position 5**.
2. **A is present** but not in positions 2 or 3. Since position 5 is E, A must be in position 1 or 4.
3. **L is present** but not in position 2.
4. **Absent letters**: C, R, N, S, T (cannot be used).
5. **Remaining letters to test**: Focus on common consonants/vowels not yet tried (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

### Strategy for Guess 3
- Test **A in position 1** and **L in position 4** to resolve their positions:
  - If A is in position 1, it will get ✓ (correct) or - (wrong position, confirming A must be in position 4).
  - If L is in position 4, it will get ✓ (correct) or - (wrong position, confirming L must be in position 3).
- Include new common letters (**M and P**) to gather more information.
- Avoid absent letters (C, R, N, S, T).

The word **""AMPLE""** fits perfectly:
- A in position 1 (tests if A is in position 1).
- M in position 2 (new letter test).
- P in position 3 (new letter test).
- L in position 4 (tests if L is in position 4).
- E in position 5 (fixed).

This guess efficiently narrows down the positions of A and L while testing two new common consonants (M and P).

We should try to cover more common consonants.\n\n Let\'s avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, N.\n\n Common consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n We also know that the word has at least two vowels? Not necessarily, but we have A and E.\n\n We can try a word that has A in a different position and also tests other common letters.\n\n Example: We can try to put A in the first position? But note, we don\'t know if A is in the first. Alternatively, we can put A in the third or fourth.\n\n Let\'s try to use a word that has A in the 3rd position and also includes other common letters.\n\n But note: we also want to test for other vowels? We already have E, and we know the word has A. The word might have more vowels? Or not.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in the 4th position? \n\n However, we must remember that we have only 5 positions and the last is E.\n\n Let me think of words ending with E and containing A (not in the 2nd) and without C, R, N.\n\n Some possibilities: \n - ...A.E -> but the A would be in the 4th? Then the word would be ? ? ? A E. But we don\'t know the first three.\n\n We can try to use a word that has A in the 1st position? For example: A _ _ _ E. But we don\'t know the middle.\n\n But note: we have to avoid C, R, N.\n\n Let me list some words that fit:\n - ABASE: ends with E, has A in first and fourth? But we don\'t know if A is repeated? The feedback for the first guess only showed one A, but there could be more? We don\'t know.\n\n However, in our first guess, we had A in the second position and it was marked as present but wrong. The word might have only one A? Or more? We don\'t know.\n\n But note: the feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicates unless we guess duplicates. So we have to be cautious.\n\n Since we are limited by the absent letters (C, R, N) and the known present letters (A, E) and the position of E (5th), we can try:\n\n Let\'s try the word ""SAUTE"". \n - S: test a common letter\n - A: in the second position? But wait, we know A is not in the second position? Actually, no: the feedback said A was in the word but not in the second position. So we should avoid putting A in the second position again.\n\n Therefore, in our new guess, we should put A in a different position: either 1, 3, or 4.\n\n But note: we also want to test other letters.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in the first position: e.g., ""ADOBE"" -> but that has O and B and D. However, we don\'t know if O is present? Also, note that we have to avoid R and C and N? ""ADOBE"" has no R, C, N. But we have to check: A (1st), D (2nd), O (3rd), B (4th), E (5th). \n\n But wait, we know that the 5th is E, so that\'s fixed. So we can try:\n\n However, we also have the constraint that A is present and not in the 2nd. Putting A in the 1st is acceptable.\n\n But let me see: if we try ""ADOBE"", then:\n - A: if the word has A in the first, then it would be marked as correct? But if not, then it might be marked as present or absent.\n\n However, we don\'t know if the word has A in the first. We only know that A is in the word and not in the second.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to put A in the 3rd or 4th.\n\n Another idea: we can try to use a word that has A in the 4th position? For example: ""PLATE"" -> but we have to avoid R? Wait, ""PLATE"" has T and L and P, but also note: we don\'t know if T, L, P are present. However, we must avoid R? But ""PLATE"" doesn\'t have R? Actually, it doesn\'t. But we also must avoid C and N? ""PLATE"" has no C, R, N.\n\n But wait: we have to consider the feedback for the first guess: we had A in the second position and it was marked as present but wrong. So if we put A in the 4th in ""PLATE"", that would be a new position.\n\n However, note that ""PLATE"" has the E at the end, which is correct. And the A is in the 4th? Actually, in ""PLATE"": \n P L A T E -> A is in the 3rd position, not 4th.\n\n Let me break down ""PLATE"":\n Position 1: P\n Position 2: L\n Position 3: A\n Position 4: T\n Position 5: E\n\n So A is in the 3rd.\n\n That\'s acceptable because we haven\'t tried A in the 3rd.\n\n But note: we also have to test other letters. We want to maximize information.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in the 1st and also tests other common letters? \n\n Let me think of words that end with E and have A in the 1st, without C, R, N:\n - ABASE: A B A S E -> but has two A\'s? We don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. Also, we are using A twice, which might not be efficient for testing new letters.\n - AGATE: A G A T E -> again two A\'s.\n - ALATE: A L A T E -> two A\'s.\n\n How about words with A in the 1st and without repeating A?\n - ABLE: only 4 letters? Not 5.\n - AWAKE: A W A K E -> two A\'s.\n - AZURE: A Z U R E -> but R is not allowed (we know R is absent).\n\n We must avoid R.\n\n How about ""AFIRE""? But has R -> not allowed.\n\n How about ""AMUSE"": A M U S E -> no R, C, N. And only one A? Actually, it has A and then U, S, E.\n\n So ""AMUSE"": \n A (1st), M (2nd), U (3rd), S (4th), E (5th)\n\n This tests:\n - A in the first position: if it\'s correct, we get a check. If not, but if the word has A and it\'s in the first, then it would be correct? Actually, if the word has A in the first, then we get a check. If the word has A but not in the first, then we get a dash? But we know A is in the word, so if we put A in the first and it\'s not the correct position, then we get a dash? But we also know that the word has A and it\'s not in the second. So if we put it in the first, we might get either check or dash.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to put A in the 3rd or 4th to see if it\'s there.\n\n Since we don\'t have much information, we can try to cover more common consonants.\n\n Another common starting approach is to use a word that has the known letters (A and E) and then test other common consonants (like T, L, S, etc.) without the forbidden letters.\n\n Let me try to form a word that has:\n - E at the end (fixed)\n - A in a new position (not 2nd) and not the 5th (which is E) so either 1, 3, or 4.\n - and includes T, L, S, or other common letters.\n\n Example: ""SLATE"" -> S L A T E\n - S: test S\n - L: test L\n - A: in the 3rd position (which we haven\'t tried)\n - T: test T\n - E: at the end (correct)\n\n But note: we must avoid R, C, N? ""SLATE"" has no R, C, N.\n\n However, we already tried the letter A in the second position and it was present but wrong. Now we are trying A in the third. This is a good test.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""PLATE"" (as I thought earlier) which is similar: P L A T E.\n\n But which one? Both are valid. Let\'s choose one that has more common letters.\n\n We haven\'t tested S, L, T, P, etc.\n\n Since we want to test as many new letters as possible, we can choose a word that doesn\'t repeat the letters we already know are absent.\n\n We know C, R, N are absent. So we can use any other letters.\n\n I think ""SLATE"" is a good choice because it has S, L, T which are very common.\n\n But note: we also have the E at the end, which we know is correct. So we are testing the first four letters.\n\n However, we must be cautious: if the word has duplicate letters, we might get unexpected feedback. But we don\'t have any duplicate in ""SLATE"".\n\n So let\'s go with ""SLATE"".\n\n But wait: what if the word has A in the first position? Then by putting A in the third, we might not get the A in the first. But that\'s okay because we are testing.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in the first and also tests other letters? But we don\'t have a good candidate without R, C, N and without repeating A.\n\n I think ""SLATE"" is a reasonable second guess.\n\n Let me write it: S L A T E\n\n But note: the word is 5 letters, so ""SLATE"" is 5 letters.\n\n However, we must make sure that we are not using any forbidden letters: no C, R, N. ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E -> no C, R, N. Good.\n\n So I will guess ""SLATE"".\n\n But wait: we have the feedback that in the first guess, the letter E was in the correct position (5th). So in ""SLATE"", we are putting E at the 5th, which is correct. That will be a check.\n\n The other positions: \n - S at 1st: we don\'t know if it\'s present or not.\n - L at 2nd: same.\n - A at 3rd: we know A is in the word, but we don\'t know if it\'s in the 3rd.\n - T at 4th: we don\'t know.\n\n This guess will help us locate A and also test S, L, T.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""SLATE"".\n\n However, note: we have to consider that the word might have the letter A in the 4th? Then we are not testing the 4th with A. But we are testing T in the 4th. If we get feedback that A is still not in the 3rd, then we know it must be in the 1st or 4th? But we are testing the 3rd. If the A is in the 4th, then in this guess the A would be in the 3rd and marked as absent? No, wait: the feedback for A would be: if the word has A and it\'s in the 4th, then when we put A in the 3rd, it would be marked as present but wrong (dash). Because the A is in the word but not in the 3rd.\n\n So we can still get information.\n\n Alternatively, if we get a dash for A, then we know A is not in the 3rd, so it must be in the 1st or 4th.\n\n And if we get a check for A, then we know it\'s in the 3rd.\n\n So it\'s a good test.\n\n Therefore, I will go with ""SLATE"".\n\n But note: we have to avoid using the same letter in the same position if we know it\'s wrong? We don\'t have that for A because we only tried position 2 and now we are trying 3.\n\n So, second guess: ""SLATE""\n\n<guess>slate</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C, R, N** are absent (marked ""x"").\n- **A** is present but not in the 2nd position (marked ""-"").\n- **E** is correct and in the 5th position (marked ""✓"").\n\nFor the second guess:\n- The word must end with **E** (5th letter).\n- **A** must be included but not in the 2nd position (so positions 1, 3, or 4 are candidates).\n- Avoid **C, R, N** entirely.\n- Test new common consonants (e.g., **S, L, T**) to gather more information.\n\nThe word **""SLATE""** fits these criteria:\n- Ends with **E** (correct position).\n- Places **A** in the 3rd position (a new position to test).\n- Uses **S, L, T** (common letters not yet tested).\n- Excludes forbidden letters (C, R, N).\n\nThis guess will help identify the position of **A** and test **S, L, T** efficiently.\n\n<guess>slate</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: - (in the word but wrong position, and specifically not in position 2)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: ✓ (correct, in position 5)\n\nGuess 2: ""slate""\n- S: x (not in the word)\n- L: - (in the word but wrong position; since it was in position 2, it\'s not there)\n- A: - (in the word but wrong position; now we know it\'s not in position 2 or 3)\n- T: x (not in the word)\n- E: ✓ (correct, in position 5)\n\nSo, from both guesses, we know:\n\n1. The word ends with E (position 5 is E).\n2. The letter A is in the word, but not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 3 (from second guess). Since the word has 5 letters and position 5 is E, A must be in position 1 or 4.\n3. The letter L is in the word, but not in position 2 (where we placed it in the second guess).\n4. The following letters are absent: C, R, N, S, T.\n\nWe also have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, L, T. So we know A, E, L are present, and C, R, N, S, T are absent.\n\nNow, we need to form a new guess that:\n- Ends with E (position 5).\n- Includes A in either position 1 or 4 (since it must be in one of these).\n- Includes L, but not in position 2 (and we haven\'t tried L in other positions yet).\n- Avoids C, R, N, S, T.\n\nAdditionally, we should try to test other common letters to uncover the remaining letters.\n\nSince A can be in position 1 or 4, we can design a guess that tests one of these possibilities.\n\nLet\'s consider the possibilities for A:\n\nOption 1: A in position 1.\nThen the word is A _ _ _ E.\n\nOption 2: A in position 4.\nThen the word is _ _ _ A E.\n\nWe also know L is present and not in position 2. So L could be in position 1, 3, or 4? But if A is in position 1, then L cannot be in 1 (unless it\'s the same letter, but they are different). Similarly, if A is in position 4, then L cannot be in 4. Also, we haven\'t tried L in position 1, 3, or 4.\n\nWe should also consider that there might be other letters we haven\'t tested. We have used 8 letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, L, T. The alphabet has 26, so many left.\n\nCommon letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe need to choose a word that fits the constraints and tests new letters.\n\nLet\'s try to form a word for each case to test:\n\nFirst, if we assume A is in position 1, then we have A _ _ _ E. We need to fill the middle three positions. We know L is in the word, so one of the middle three must be L (but not position 2, so position 3 or 4? But position 4 is the third blank? Let me index:\n\nPosition 1: A\nPosition 2: ? (cannot be L, because we tried L in position 2 and it was wrong, and also not A because we know A is not in position 2)\nPosition 3: ?\nPosition 4: ?\nPosition 5: E\n\nBut note: we also know that L is in the word and not in position 2. So L must be in position 3 or 4? But position 4 is the fourth character. Also, we have to avoid S, T, C, R, N.\n\nPossible words: \n- A _ L _ E -> but we need to fill position 2 and 4. And we know L is in position 3? Then we have A ? L ? E. But we don\'t know if L is in position 3.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to put L in position 3 to test it.\n\nBut we don\'t have to fix the position of A in this guess. We can choose a word that tests A in position 4, for example.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has A in position 4 and L in a new position (like position 1 or 3) to test both.\n\nLet me think of words that end with E, have A in position 4, and L in the word (but not position 2), and avoid C, R, N, S, T.\n\nFor example: \n- _ _ _ A E, and the word must contain L.\n\nSome words: \n- ""BLARE"" -> but has R (absent) and we avoid R.\n- ""FLAME"" -> F L A M E: but L is in position 2? We know L is not in position 2, so we cannot put L in position 2. Also, we are testing A in position 3? No, in ""FLAME"", A is in position 3? Let\'s see: F(1), L(2), A(3), M(4), E(5). But we want A in position 4? Then this is not.\n\nWe need A in position 4: so the fourth letter is A.\n\nExample: ""OVALE""? Not a word. \n""LOCAE""? Not common.\n\nHow about ""GLAZE"": G L A Z E -> A is in position 3, not 4.\n\nWe need the fourth letter to be A: so pattern: _ _ _ A E.\n\nWords: \n- ""PULSE"" -> but has S (absent) and U, L, but L is in position 2? P(1), U(2), L(3), S(4), E(5) -> no, A is not present.\n\nWe need a word that has A in the fourth position and E at the end, and also contains L (somewhere not position 2).\n\nFor example: \n- ""VIALE"": V I A L E -> A is in position 3, not 4.\n- ""DANCE"": has C and N, absent.\n- ""FABLE"": F A B L E -> A is in position 2, but we know A is not in position 2? And also, we are avoiding? F(1), A(2), B(3), L(4), E(5). But we know A is not in position 2, so this is invalid because we are putting A in position 2? We cannot put A in position 2 because we know it\'s not there.\n\nWe must not put A in position 2 or 3 (from feedback). So in the new guess, we can put A in position 1 or 4.\n\nSimilarly, we must not put L in position 2.\n\nSo for a word with A in position 4: _ _ _ A E, and L must be in position 1 or 3 (since position 2 is forbidden for L, and position 4 is A, so L cannot be there).\n\nSo possibilities:\n- L in position 1: L _ _ A E\n- L in position 3: _ _ L A E\n\nNow, let\'s find words that fit:\n\nOption 1: L in position 1: L _ _ A E\n- We need to fill position 2 and 3, avoiding C, R, N, S, T, and also the letter in position 2 cannot be L (but L is already in 1) and cannot be A (but A is in 4). Also, the word must be valid.\n\nPossible words: \n- ""LEAVE"": L E A V E -> but E is in position 2? And we have E at the end, but the word has two E\'s? Also, A is in position 3, not 4. We need A in position 4. So not.\n- ""LOAVE"": not a common word? And A is in position 3? L O A V E -> A in 3.\n- ""LAMAE"": not a word.\n\nIt\'s hard to find a word with A in position 4 and starting with L.\n\nOption 2: L in position 3: _ _ L A E\n- So pattern: ? ? L A E\n\nWe need to fill positions 1 and 2, avoiding C, R, N, S, T, and the letters must be from the remaining alphabet.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""BLAZE"": B L A Z E -> but L is in position 2? We have L in position 2, which we know is wrong. We cannot put L in position 2. In this pattern, we are putting L in position 3, so position 2 is a different letter.\n\nIn the pattern _ _ L A E, position 2 is the second letter, and we are not putting L there. We are putting L in position 3.\n\nSo:\nPosition 1: ?\nPosition 2: ? (cannot be L, and cannot be A because A is not in position 2, and also avoid C, R, N, S, T)\nPosition 3: L\nPosition 4: A\nPosition 5: E\n\nNow, what words fit this pattern? And are valid English words.\n\nExamples:\n- ""ABLE"": only 4 letters.\n- We need 5 letters: so ""??LAE""\n\nPossible words:\n- ""GLAZE"": G L A Z E -> but here L is in position 2, not 3. We need L in position 3. So not.\n- ""PLACE"": P L A C E -> L in position 2, and C is absent. Not.\n- ""FLAME"": F L A M E -> L in position 2. Not.\n\nHow about ""ILIAC""? I L I A C -> but C is absent, and also pattern is I(1), L(2), I(3), A(4), C(5) -> but we need E at the end? No, we need E at the end.\n\nWe need the word to end with E.\n\nSo: _ _ L A E\n\nWords: \n- ""Kylae""? Not a word.\n- ""ULNAE"": U L N A E -> but L is in position 2 (forbidden) and N is absent.\n- ""ELVAE"": E L V A E -> L in position 2? E(1), L(2), V(3), A(4), E(5). But we cannot have L in position 2.\n\nIt\'s difficult to find a word with L in position 3 and A in position 4 and E at the end.\n\nAlternatively, we can try the other case: A in position 1.\n\nSo pattern: A _ _ _ E\n\nAnd L is in the word, not in position 2, so in position 3 or 4.\n\nAlso, avoid C, R, N, S, T.\n\nSo:\n- If L in position 3: A _ L _ E\n- If L in position 4: A _ _ L E\n\nNow, let\'s find words.\n\nFirst, A _ L _ E:\n- We need to fill position 2 and 4, avoiding forbidden letters.\n\nPosition 2: cannot be L (already in 3), cannot be A (duplicate? but we don\'t know if A is duplicated, but we have A in 1, so position 2 is different). Also avoid C, R, N, S, T.\n\nPosition 4: similarly.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""APPLE"": A P P L E -> but L is in position 4, not 3. We are looking for L in position 3? In ""APPLE"": A(1), P(2), P(3), L(4), E(5). So L is in position 4.\n\nWe need L in position 3 for this subcase.\n\nSo A _ L _ E, with L in position 3.\n\nExamples:\n- ""AMBLE"": A M B L E -> L is in position 4? A(1), M(2), B(3), L(4), E(5). Not position 3.\n- ""ADDLE"": A D D L E -> L in position 4.\n- ""AGILE"": A G I L E -> L in position 4.\n\nI\'m having trouble finding a word with L in position 3.\n\nHow about ""AXILE"": A X I L E -> L in position 4.\n\n""ANILE"": has N, absent.\n\n""ALIKE"": A L I K E -> L in position 2, which is forbidden.\n\nPerhaps ""AISLE"": A I S L E -> but S is absent, and L is in position 4.\n\nIt seems hard to find a word with L in position 3.\n\nNow, the other subcase: A _ _ L E, with L in position 4.\n\nPattern: A ? ? L E\n\nWe need to fill position 2 and 3, avoiding C, R, N, S, T.\n\nExamples:\n- ""APPLE"": A P P L E -> positions: A(1), P(2), P(3), L(4), E(5). This works, and P is not forbidden.\n- ""AMPLE"": A M P L E -> M and P.\n- ""ABLED"": but ends with D, not E? ""ABLE"" is 4 letters. ""ABLED"" is 5 but ends with D.\n- ""ADDLE"": A D D L E -> D is allowed.\n- ""ADOBE"": A D O B E -> but no L? We need L in position 4? This has B in position 4, not L.\n\nWe need L in position 4.\n\nSo words like: APPLE, AMPLE, ADDLE, AISLE (but S is absent), AGILE (G and I), etc.\n\nBut we must avoid S, so ""AISLE"" is out.\n\n""ANKLE"": has N and K? N is absent.\n\n""AXLE"": only 4 letters.\n\nSo possible words: APPLE, AMPLE, ADDLE.\n\nBut we also have to consider that we haven\'t tested many letters. We can use one of these to test.\n\nHowever, we also know that L is in the word, and in this case, we are putting L in position 4. If it\'s correct, good. If not, then L must be in position 1 or 3? But we are assuming A is in position 1, so position 1 is taken, so L must be in position 3? But we couldn\'t find a word with L in position 3.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 4 and L in position 1 or 3, but we had difficulty finding words.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the word has duplicate letters? But we don\'t have evidence yet.\n\nWe have only 6 tries, so we need to make progress.\n\nLet\'s list the letters we know are in the word: A, E, L.\n\nAnd we know E is at the end.\n\nA is in position 1 or 4.\n\nL is in the word, not in position 2, and not in the position of A.\n\nAlso, we have two positions left (if A is in 1, then positions 2,3,4 but one is L and two others; similarly if A is in 4, then positions 1,2,3 with one being L and two others).\n\nBut we have to fill the blanks with letters not in the absent list: absent are C, R, N, S, T.\n\nCommon letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe can try to guess a word that has A in position 1 and L in position 4, like ""APPLE"" or ""AMPLE"", but let\'s see what they test.\n\n""APPLE"": \n- A in position 1: if correct, then we get a check. If not, then A is not in 1, so it must be in 4.\n- L in position 4: if correct, then we get a check. If not, then L is not in 4, so it must be in 3 (since not in 2).\n- Also, it tests P in position 2 and 3? But if we get feedback that P is absent, then we know P is not in the word.\n\nSimilarly, ""AMPLE"" tests M and P.\n\nBut we don\'t know if P or M are in the word.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t assume A\'s position but tests it explicitly.\n\nFor example, we can put A in position 4 in this guess to see if it\'s there. If we get a dash or check for A, we know.\n\nSimilarly for L, we can put it in a new position.\n\nLet\'s try to put A in position 4 and L in position 1.\n\nSo pattern: L _ _ A E\n\nWe need to fill position 2 and 3.\n\nAvoid C, R, N, S, T.\n\nWhat words? ""LAMAE"" not a word. ""Lavae""? L A V A E -> A in position 2 and 4, but we know A is not in position 2, so we cannot put A in position 2. So position 2 cannot be A.\n\nSo L _ _ A E, position 2 must not be A and not L (already in 1).\n\nExamples:\n- ""LUCRE"": has R and C, absent.\n- ""LAPSE"": has S and P, but S is absent.\n- ""LARGE"": has R, absent.\n- ""LATHE"": has T and H, but T is absent.\n- ""LOAVE"": not common, and O and V? L O A V E -> but A is in position 3, not 4.\n\nWe need A in position 4.\n\n""LILAE"": not a word.\n\n""LIBRA"": no E.\n\nIt\'s very hard.\n\nPerhaps ""LOAVE"" is sometimes accepted? But let\'s not use it.\n\nAnother idea: put A in position 1 and L in position 3, even though it\'s hard to find a word. What about ""AGLET""? But ends with T, absent, and T is out.\n\n""AGLEY"": A G L E Y -> but only 5 letters? A(1), G(2), L(3), E(4), Y(5). But we need E at position 5, so this has E in position 4, not 5.\n\nWe need the fifth letter to be E.\n\nSo for A in position 1 and L in position 3: A _ L _ E\n\nFill position 2 and 4.\n\nPosition 2: avoid A, L, and absent letters.\nPosition 4: avoid absent letters.\n\nWords:\n- ""AISLE"": A I S L E -> but S is absent, and L is in position 4, not 3.\n- ""AMBLE"": A M B L E -> L in position 4.\n- ""ANKLE"": has N.\n- ""APPLE"": L in position 4.\n- ""AXILE"": L in position 4.\n\nI found ""ADZHE"": not a word.\n\nPerhaps ""ABLE L"" is not working.\n\nLet\'s try a different approach. We know L is in the word and not in position 2, so let\'s put L in position 1 or 3 or 4.\n\nWe also know A is in 1 or 4.\n\nSo to test both, we can put A in position 4 and L in position 3.\n\nPattern: _ _ L A E\n\nWe need to fill position 1 and 2.\n\nAvoid C, R, N, S, T.\n\nWhat words? \n- ""BULAE"": B U L A E -> positions: B(1), U(2), L(3), A(4), E(5). This seems possible? But is ""BULAE"" a word? I think ""bula"" is not English. ""Bulla"" is but that\'s two L\'s.\n\n""Bulla"" is 5 letters: B U L L A, not ending with E.\n\n""FLAE"" not 5.\n\n""PLUAE"" not word.\n\n"" value"" but V A L U E, not the pattern.\n\nPerhaps ""ILIAC"" without E.\n\nI think we need to use a word that has A in position 1 and L in position 4, as we have examples like ""APPLE"", ""AMPLE"", ""ADDLE"".\n\nLet\'s choose ""AMPLE"" because it has M and P, common letters.\n\nSo guess: ""AMPLE""\n\n- A in position 1: will tell us if A is in 1 or not.\n- M in position 2: new letter.\n- P in position 3: new letter.\n- L in position 4: will tell us if L is in 4 or not.\n- E in position 5: correct.\n\nIf A is in position 1, we get a check; if not, we get a dash (but we know A is in the word, so if not in 1, then it must be in 4).\n\nSimilarly for L: if in position 4, check; if not, then L must be in position 3 (since not in 2).\n\nAlso, we test M and P.\n\nSo it\'s informative.\n\nTherefore, I will guess ""AMPLE"".\n\n<guess>ample</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback\n\nFrom the feedback:\n- **Guess 1: CRANE**  \n  - C (x): Not in the word.  \n  - R (x): Not in the word.  \n  - A (-): In the word but wrong position (not position 2).  \n  - N (x): Not in the word.  \n  - E (✓): Correct and in position 5.  \n\n- **Guess 2: SLATE**  \n  - S (x): Not in the word.  \n  - L (-): In the word but wrong position (not position 2).  \n  - A (-): In the word but wrong position (not position 3).  \n  - T (x): Not in the word.  \n  - E (✓): Correct and in position 5.  \n\n### Key Insights\n1. **E is fixed in position 5**.\n2. **A is present** but not in positions 2 or 3.

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (absent)
- R: x (absent)
- A: - (present, but not in position 2)
- N: x (absent)
- E: ✓ (correct, position 5)

Guess 2: ""slate""
- S: x (absent)
- L: - (present, but not in position 2)
- A: - (present, but not in position 3)
- T: x (absent)
- E: ✓ (correct, position 5)

Guess 3: ""ample""
- A: - (present, but not in position 1)
- M: x (absent)
- P: x (absent)
- L: ✓ (correct, position 4) -> so L is in position 4
- E: ✓ (correct, position 5)

Conclusions so far:

1. E is fixed in position 5.
2. L is fixed in position 4 (since we got a check in ""ample"" at position 4).
3. A is present in the word, but it is not in position 2 (from ""crane""), not in position 3 (from ""slate""), and not in position 1 (from ""ample""). Therefore, the only position left for A is position 1? But wait, the word has positions: 1,2,3,4,5. We know:
   - Position 4 is L, position 5 is E.
   - A is not in 1,2, or 3. So the only possibility is position? But position 4 is L, and position 5 is E, so A cannot be in position 4 or 5? Contradiction?

Wait, let's list the positions:

Position 1: ? 
Position 2: ?
Position 3: ?
Position 4: L (from guess 3)
Position 5: E (fixed)

A must be in the word but cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3. The only positions left are 4 and 5, but position 4 is L and position 5 is E, neither is A. So we have a conflict.

Unless the word has duplicate letters? We haven't considered that. Maybe the word has two A's?

Because in the feedback for ""crane"", A was present (but not in 2), ""slate"" A was present (but not in 3), ""ample"" A was present (but not in 1). So A is definitely in the word. But if the word has L in position 4 and E in position 5, and no A in positions 1,2,3, then A must be in position 4? But position 4 is L, so if A is also in position 4, that would require A and L to be the same, which they are not. Therefore, the word must have an additional occurrence of A? That is, the word contains at least two A's? 

But in guess 3, we only put A in position 1. But the word has another A somewhere else. Because if there was only one A, and it's not in 1,2,3, and not in 4 (which is L) and not in 5 (E), then it wouldn't be in the word, but it is.

So the word must have at least two A's. One in an undetected position and one that we've been missing.

But we put A in three positions: 2,3,1 and got dashes, meaning that in none of these positions is the correct A. But if there is another A somewhere, where else can it be? The only positions are 1,2,3,4,5.

Position 4 is L and position 5 is E, so they cannot be A. Therefore, one of the positions 1-3 must have the A? But we got dashes in all three guesses, meaning that the A is not in those positions we guessed. But we haven't tested the possibility that the word has an A in a position we haven't guessed, but there are no more positions.

Wait, I think I have it: the A must be in position 4? But we have L in position 4, and we got a check for L in position 4. That means position 4 is L, not A. And E in position 5. So the A must be in one of positions 1,2,3. But we have guesses:

- In ""crane"", we put A in position 2: got dash -> A is not in position 2.
- In ""slate"", we put A in position 3: got dash -> A is not in position 3.
- In ""ample"", we put A in position 1: got dash -> A is not in position 1.

So how can there be an A? The only way is if the word has an additional A in another position, but all positions are covered. For example, if the word has A in position 4, but we know position 4 is L, so it can't be.

This seems impossible unless one of our inferences is wrong.

But the feedback shows A is present in all three guesses. For guess 3: A(-), meaning A is in the word but not in position 1.

So A must be somewhere else. But we know positions: 1,2,3,4,5. 4 is L, 5 is E. So the only remaining positions are 1,2,3. But we've ruled out 1,2,3? 

Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that the word has two A's: one in a position we haven't guessed yet? No, we've guessed all positions.

Alternatively, in one of the guesses, the dash for A could correspond to the correct position but we misinterpreted? But no, the dashes mean ""in the word but wrong position"".

The only possibility left is that the word has an A in position 4? But we have L in position 4. How can both be true?

Ah, I see: in guess 3, ""ample"": we have A in position 1 (dash), M in 2 (absent), P in 3 (absent), L in 4 (check), E in 5 (check). So the word is: ? ? ? L E

And we know A is not in position 1. 

But what if the word has an A that is not in position 1? It must be in 2 or 3 or 4 or 5. But 4 is L and 5 is E, so not A. And we know from guess 1 that if A is in position 2, it would have been marked as present but wrong in ""crane"" (which it was, dash in position 2). Similarly for position 3 in ""slate"". So we know it's not in those positions.

So the only remaining possibility: the word has two A's? And the A that is present in the feedback must be a second A.

For example, the word might be like ""LAPSE"" but that has S and we know S is absent. Or ""eaten"" but ends with N? N is absent.

We must assume there is a duplicate A.

In guess 3, we only used one A, but the word has two A's: perhaps in position 3 or 2? But we have rules them out?

Let's rethink with the possibility of two A's.

From guess 1: ""crane"" - A in position 2: dash. This means the word has an A (could be one of possibly multiple), but not in position 2. And it could have another A in an unknown position.

Similarly, Guess 2: ""slate"" - A in position 3: dash. This means that there is an A not in position 3. Could be the same A as in guess 1 or a different one.

Guess 3: ""ample"" - A in position 1: dash. So not in position 1.

But the word has at least one A, which is not in 1,2,3.

But if there is a second A, it could be in any position, including 4 or 5? But position 4 is L and position 5 is E, so not.

Therefore, if there is an A in the word, it must be in position 2 or 3? But the dashes said it's not in the position we guessed, but there could be a duplicate A in the same or different position.

But the dash only tells us that the letter is in the word but not in that position. It doesn't preclude that there is also the same letter in the correct position if we had guessed it multiple times, but we only guessed one A per word.

For example, if the word has two A's, say one in position 2 and one in position 4. But in guess 1, we put A in position 2: then if the word has A in position 2, it would have been marked as correct! But it was marked as dash, so position 2 is not A. Similarly for others.

But if the word has an A in position 4 and one in position 1, for example. In guess 3, we put A in position 1: if the word has A in position 1, it would be a check, but it was a dash, so not in 1. If the word has an A in position 4, then in guess 3, since we didn't put A in position 4, the feedback for A might not reflect the position 4 A correctly? Let me recall the rules for duplicates.

Typically in Wordle, if there are duplicate letters, it can be a bit tricky. The feedback only considers one occurrence per target letter. So if you guess a letter with one occurrence, and the target has two, then:
- If you guess one in the correct position, you get a check for that position.
- If you guess one in the wrong position, you get a dash.
- The second occurrence in the target might not get any feedback if you didn't guess it.

In guess 3: ""ample"" = A,M,P,L,E
If the target word has an A in position 4, but position 4 is filled with L in our guess. So we guess L at position 4, and if there is an A at position 4, it should but we don't have that because we put L there.

If the word is ""LARGE"" but R is absent.

There's an example: suppose the word is ""LEAVE"". But E is at position 5, and L is at position 4? ""LEAVE"" is L,E,A,V,E: positions 1=L,2=E,3=A,4=V,5=E. But we have L in position 4 in our feedback? Not matching.

Let's list the known fixed letters: position 4 is L, position 5 is E.

So the word must be _ _ _ L E

And it has at least one A.

From guess 1, when we put A in position 2 (in ""crane""), we got a dash, meaning A is in the word but not in position 2. Therefore, A is in position 1 or 3? But from guess 2 and 3, we got dashes for A in position 3 and 1.

So if the word has only one A, we have a contradiction.

Therefore, the word must have two A's: one in position 1,2, or3 and the other in a position we haven't ruled out? But we've ruled out all positions.

Unless we consider that in a position where we have a dash, it doesn't mean there isn't also the same letter in the correct position; it just means that the specific occurrence we guessed is not correct.

But for position 1: in guess 3, we guessed A in position 1 and got a dash. That means that there is an A in the word but not at position 1. Similarly for position 2 in guess 1 and position 3 in guess 2.

So for the word to have an A in position 1, it must be that when we guess position 1 with A, we get a check. But we got a dash, so position 1 is not A.

Similarly, position 2 is not A, position 3 is not A.

But then A must be in position 4 or 5. But position 4 is L, position 5 is E, so they are not A.

We must conclude that feedback is for a different occurrence.

For instance, suppose the word is ""e.g., KARMA"" but doesn't end with E.

We need to assume that the word has an A in a position we haven't guessed. But we have! We guessed all positions in aggregate.

Position 4 and 5 are set to L and E, but if the word has an A in position 4, then how come in guess 3, we got L for position 4 check? That would only happen if position 4 is L, not A.

Position 5 is E.

So the only hope is that the word has two A's: one in position 1,2, or3 and the other in position 4 or5 but position 4 and5 are fixed to L and E, so not.

Unless position 4 is A and L is in a different position? But we have a check for L in position 4 in guess 3.

I think the only way is to accept that the word has an A in one of positions 1-3, but our dashes are because there might be a second A that is in the correct position, but we haven't guessed that position with A.

But we have guessed each position with A at least once.

Perhaps for guess 3, the feedback for A(dash) means that there is another A in the word not in position 1, but it could be in position 2,3,4,5.

But position 4 is L, so not A; position 5 is E, so not.

So in guess 3, the dash for A could only come from an A in position 2 or 3.

But in guess 1, when we put A in position 2, we got a dash, which doesn't prevent the word from having an A in position 3, for example.

In guess 2, when we put A in position 3, we got a dash.

So it's possible that there is an A in position 2 and another in position 3, and when we put A in position 2, we get a dash for that specific A, but the A in position 3 might not be acknowledged because we didn't guess it there? But in guess 1, we had A in position 2, and the word has A in position 2 and 3. Then the feedback would have: position 2 would be dash or check? If the word has A in position 2, and we guess A in position 2, it should be a check. But it was a dash, so position 2 is not A.

Similarly, position 3 is not A in guess 2.

So we go back to square one.

Perhaps there's a mistake in the assumed positions.

Let's output what we know:
- The word is in the form: [letter1] [letter2] [letter3] L E

Now, from guess 1: ""crane"" was C R A N E -> feedback A(dash) for position 3? No, ""crane"" has A in position 3? Let's index ""crane"":
C(1), R(2), A(3), N(4), E(5)

Feedback for A: dash, and it was position 3.

Similarly, ""slate"": S(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5) -> A dash, position 3? No, in ""slate"", A is in position 3? ""slate"": S1, L2, A3, T4, E5.

But in guess 2, we have A in position 3, and feedback dash, so A not in position 3.

But in guess 1, ""crane"": positions C1, R2, A3, N4, E5. Feedback A in position 3: dash. So A not in position 3.

And in guess 3, ""ample"": A1, M2, P3, L4, E5. Feedback A in position 1: dash, so A not in position 1.

Also, from guess 2: L in position 2, feedback dash for L, so L not in position 2.

But we have since learned that L is in position 4.

So for letter 2: we haven't discovered it yet.

Possible locations for A: position 2. because position 1,3 are ruled out, position 4 and5 are taken.

Position 2 is still unknown.

In guess 1, we had R in position 2, which was absent. In guess 2, we had L in position 2, which was dash (meaning L is in the word but not there). In guess 3, we had M in position 2, absent.

So position 2 could be A? But we have never put A in position 2 after the first guess? In guess 1, we put A in position 3, not in position 2. Guess 1: position 2 was R, which was absent. We haven't tested A in position 2 since the first guess? In guess 1, position 2 was R, not A.

Oh! This is key. In guess 1, ""crane"", we put A in position 3. We didn't put A in position 2 in any guess after that. In guess 2, we put A in position 3, in guess 3 in position 1.

So we have never tested position 2 with A. Therefore, it is possible that A is in position 2.

In the first guess, when we put R in position 2 and got 'x', that means R is absent, not that position 2 cannot be A.

We tested position 2 with R in guess 1 (absent), with L in guess 2 (dash, L is present but not there), and with M in guess 3 (absent). We haven't put A in position 2.

So it is possible that position 2 is A.

But in guess 2, when we put L in position 2, we got a dash for L, meaning L is in the word but not in position 2. That doesn't say anything about A.

So for A, it could be in position 2.

Let's check the feedback for A. In all three guesses, we got a dash for A, but that only means that the A we guessed is not in the correct position, but there could be another A that is in the correct position which we haven't guessed.

For example, if the word has A in position 2, and in guess 1 we put A in position 3 (so then we got a dash for position 3 A because it's not in position 3 but there is an A in position 2).

Similarly, in guess 2, we put A in position 3, and there is an A in position 2, so dash because it's not correct position for that instance.

In guess 3, we put A in position 1, and there is an A in position 2, so dash for position 1.

Moreover, position 2 hasn't been tested with A.

Therefore, it is possible that A is in position 2.

Let's assume that.

So the word is: [letter1] A [letter3] L E

Now, we know from previous feedback that the word contains A and L and E, and we know not C, R, N, S, T, M, P.

Also, for Guess 2: ""slate"" had L in position 2, which was dash. But if the word has L in position 4, so that's fine.

We need to find letter1 and letter3, which are neither A nor L nor E, and not in the absent list.

Absent letters: C,R,N,S,T,M,P

So letters available: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Now, what words fit this pattern: ? A ? L E

Examples:
- ""BAYLE"" not word.
- ""HABLE"" not common? Have ""gable"", but G is allowed? ""GABLE"": G A B L E
- ""TABLE"": T is absent, not allowed.
- ""BAYLE"" not.
- ""KABUL"" ends with L, but not E.

With E at the end: ""cable"" has C, absent.
 ""fable"": F A B L E
 ""gable"": G A B L E
 ""sable"": S is absent.
 ""label"": L in position 1, but we have A in position 2, and position 3 would be B, position 4 L, so ""label"" is L A B E L? 5 letters: L A B E L? ""label"" is L-A-B-E-L, so positions 1=L,2=A,3=B,4=E,5=L. But we need position 4 to be L and 5 to be E.

Our word is ? A ? L E, so position 4 and 5 are L and E.

For ""gable"": G(1) A(2) B(3) L(4) E(5) -- this fits.

Similarly, ""fable"" : F(1) A(2) B(3) L(4) E(5)

Now, we need to check against feedback.

In guess 1: ""crane"" - C R A N E -> feedback for position 3=A: dash. If the word is ""fable"", then A is in position 2. When we guess position 3 with A, it should be a dash because the correct A is in position 2. So it matches.

In guess 2: ""slate"" - S L A T E -> positions: S1, L2, A3, T4, E5. Feedback: S absent (correct), L dash (because our word has L in position 4, not 2), A dash (because A is in position 2, not 3), T absent (correct), E correct.

In guess 3: ""ample"" - A1, M2, P3, L4, E5. Feedback: A dash (because A is in position 2, not 1), M absent, P absent, L correct, E correct.

So ""fable"" and ""gable"" are candidates, with ' Fable ' using F and B, ' Gable ' using G and B.

Both B, F, G are not in the absent list.

Now, we need to choose one or test.

We can guess either, but we have few tries left.

Perhaps guess ""fable"" or ""gable"".

But there could be other words.

 like ""nable"" not a word.

""TABLE"" has T, absent.

""KABEL"" may not be common.

 So mainly ""fable"" and ""gable"".

We can also test with a word that has new letters.

But we only have two positions: letter1 and letter3.

The next guess should be to discriminate between possible words.

But first, we can guess one of them.

Or use a guess that tests multiple possibilities.

For example, use a word that has B in position 3 to confirm.

But we don't have many options.

Since both ""fable"" and ""gable"" have B in position 3, if we can confirm B is in the word, then either could be it.

But we have no information about B.

Conversely, if we want to test letter1, we can use a guess that has different letters.

But the only other letters in position 1 for such words are like ""cable"" (C absent), ""sable"" (S absent), so only ""fable"" and ""gable"" and perhaps ""hable"" not word.

Or ""DABLE"" not common, ""ABLE' is 4.

So only ""fable"" and ""gable"".

We can guess one.

 or use a word that  2 to test for G or F.

But with our known pattern, it's hard to find a guess that tests letter1 and letter3.

We are sure that position 2 is A, position 4 is L, position 5 is E.

We only need positions 1 and 3.

In our guess, for positions 1 and 3, we can put any letters but avoid absent letters and using the present letters in incorrect positions? We know A and L and E are present, but they are fixed except for positions 1 and 3.

For the guess, we need to use a valid word.

We can guess ""fable"" with F in position 1 and B in position 3.

If the word is ""fable"", it should be all correct.

If not, then it might be ""gable"".

So let's guess ""fable"".

Or ""gable"" similarly.

To be systematic, we can choose ""fable"" first.

But let's see the remaining absent letters include F and G? We haven't tested them, so they might be present or not.

By guessing ""fable"", if we get feedback that F and B are correct, it is the word. If not, then we know F is not in position 1 or B not in position 3, and we can try ""gable"" next.

Since we have 3 tries left (guess 4,5,6 out of 6), we can do that.

So I'll guess ""fable"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRANE**  
  - C (x): Absent.  
  - R (x): Absent.  
  - A (-): In the word, but not in position 3.  
  - N (x): Absent.  
  - E (✓): Correct in position 5.  
- **Guess 2: SLATE**  
  - S (x): Absent.

### Key Insights
1. **Fixed positions**:  
   - Position 4 is **L** (from Guess 3).  
   - Position 5 is **E** (consistent in all guesses).  
2. **A is present**:  
   - Ruled out of positions 1, 2 (inferred from feedback), and 3.  
   - Only position 2 is untested for A. Must be in position 2 (as positions 1, 3, 4 (L), and 5 (E) are invalid).  
3. **Absent letters**: C, R, N, S, T, M, P (cannot be used).  
4. **Word structure**: The word is `[LETTER1] A [LETTER3] L E`.  
   - `LETTER1` and `LETTER3` must be from the remaining letters (not absent).  
5. **Candidate words**:  
   - **FABLE**: F (position 1), A (position 2), B (position 3), L (position 4), E (position 5).  
   - **GABLE**: G (position 1), A (position 2), B (position 3), L (position 4), E (position 5).  
   - Both fit the pattern and avoid absent letters.  

### Strategy for Guess 4
- **Resolve ambiguity**: Test **FABLE** to verify the pattern and letters.  
  - If correct, all positions will be marked with ✓.  
  - If incorrect, feedback will confirm F or B presence/position, and **GABLE** becomes the next candidate.  
- Maximizes information: Tests untested letters F and B in positions 1 and 3, leveraging the A and L/E fixation.  

<guess>fable</guess>",fable,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (absent)
- R: x (absent)
- A: - (present, but not in position 2)
- N: x (absent)
- E: ✓ (correct, position 5)

Guess 2: ""slate""
- S: x (absent)
- L: - (present, but not in position 2)
- A: - (present, but not in position 3)
- T: x (absent)
- E: ✓ (correct, position 5)

Guess 3: ""ample""
- A: - (present, but not in position 1)
- M: x (absent)
- P: x (absent)
- L: ✓ (correct, position 4) -> so L is in position 4
- E: ✓ (correct, position 5)

Conclusions so far:

1. E is fixed in position 5.
2. L is fixed in position 4 (since we got a check in ""ample"" at position 4).
3. A is present in the word, but it is not in position 2 (from ""crane""), not in position 3 (from ""slate""), and not in position 1 (from ""ample""). Therefore, the only position left for A is position 1? But wait, the word has positions: 1,2,3,4,5. We know:
   - Position 4 is L, position 5 is E.
   - A is not in 1,2, or 3. So the only possibility is position? But position 4 is L, and position 5 is E, so A cannot be in position 4 or 5? Contradiction?

Wait, let's list the positions:

Position 1: ? 
Position 2: ?
Position 3: ?
Position 4: L (from guess 3)
Position 5: E (fixed)

A must be in the word but cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3. The only positions left are 4 and 5, but position 4 is L and position 5 is E, neither is A. So we have a conflict.

Unless the word has duplicate letters? We haven't considered that. Maybe the word has two A's?

Because in the feedback for ""crane"", A was present (but not in 2), ""slate"" A was present (but not in 3), ""ample"" A was present (but not in 1). So A is definitely in the word. But if the word has L in position 4 and E in position 5, and no A in positions 1,2,3, then A must be in position 4? But position 4 is L, so if A is also in position 4, that would require A and L to be the same, which they are not. Therefore, the word must have an additional occurrence of A? That is, the word contains at least two A's? 

But in guess 3, we only put A in position 1. But the word has another A somewhere else. Because if there was only one A, and it's not in 1,2,3, and not in 4 (which is L) and not in 5 (E), then it wouldn't be in the word, but it is.

So the word must have at least two A's. One in an undetected position and one that we've been missing.

But we put A in three positions: 2,3,1 and got dashes, meaning that in none of these positions is the correct A. But if there is another A somewhere, where else can it be? The only positions are 1,2,3,4,5.

Position 4 is L and position 5 is E, so they cannot be A. Therefore, one of the positions 1-3 must have the A? But we got dashes in all three guesses, meaning that the A is not in those positions we guessed. But we haven't tested the possibility that the word has an A in a position we haven't guessed, but there are no more positions.

Wait, I think I have it: the A must be in position 4? But we have L in position 4, and we got a check for L in position 4. That means position 4 is L, not A. And E in position 5. So the A must be in one of positions 1,2,3. But we have guesses:

- In ""crane"", we put A in position 2: got dash -> A is not in position 2.
- In ""slate"", we put A in position 3: got dash -> A is not in position 3.
- In ""ample"", we put A in position 1: got dash -> A is not in position 1.

So how can there be an A? The only way is if the word has an additional A in another position, but all positions are covered. For example, if the word has A in position 4, but we know position 4 is L, so it can't be.

This seems impossible unless one of our inferences is wrong.

But the feedback shows A is present in all three guesses. For guess 3: A(-), meaning A is in the word but not in position 1.

So A must be somewhere else. But we know positions: 1,2,3,4,5. 4 is L, 5 is E. So the only remaining positions are 1,2,3. But we've ruled out 1,2,3? 

Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that the word has two A's: one in a position we haven't guessed yet? No, we've guessed all positions.

Alternatively, in one of the guesses, the dash for A could correspond to the correct position but we misinterpreted? But no, the dashes mean ""in the word but wrong position"".

The only possibility left is that the word has an A in position 4? But we have L in position 4. How can both be true?

Ah, I see: in guess 3, ""ample"": we have A in position 1 (dash), M in 2 (absent), P in 3 (absent), L in 4 (check), E in 5 (check). So the word is: ? ? ? L E

And we know A is not in position 1. 

But what if the word has an A that is not in position 1? It must be in 2 or 3 or 4 or 5. But 4 is L and 5 is E, so not A. And we know from guess 1 that if A is in position 2, it would have been marked as present but wrong in ""crane"" (which it was, dash in position 2). Similarly for position 3 in ""slate"". So we know it's not in those positions.

So the only remaining possibility: the word has two A's? And the A that is present in the feedback must be a second A.

For example, the word might be like ""LAPSE"" but that has S and we know S is absent. Or ""eaten"" but ends with N? N is absent.

We must assume there is a duplicate A.

In guess 3, we only used one A, but the word has two A's: perhaps in position 3 or 2? But we have rules them out?

Let's rethink with the possibility of two A's.

From guess 1: ""crane"" - A in position 2: dash. This means the word has an A (could be one of possibly multiple), but not in position 2. And it could have another A in an unknown position.

Similarly, Guess 2: ""slate"" - A in position 3: dash. This means that there is an A not in position 3. Could be the same A as in guess 1 or a different one.

Guess 3: ""ample"" - A in position 1: dash. So not in position 1.

But the word has at least one A, which is not in 1,2,3.

But if there is a second A, it could be in any position, including 4 or 5? But position 4 is L and position 5 is E, so not.

Therefore, if there is an A in the word, it must be in position 2 or 3? But the dashes said it's not in the position we guessed, but there could be a duplicate A in the same or different position.

But the dash only tells us that the letter is in the word but not in that position. It doesn't preclude that there is also the same letter in the correct position if we had guessed it multiple times, but we only guessed one A per word.

For example, if the word has two A's, say one in position 2 and one in position 4. But in guess 1, we put A in position 2: then if the word has A in position 2, it would have been marked as correct! But it was marked as dash, so position 2 is not A. Similarly for others.

But if the word has an A in position 4 and one in position 1, for example. In guess 3, we put A in position 1: if the word has A in position 1, it would be a check, but it was a dash, so not in 1. If the word has an A in position 4, then in guess 3, since we didn't put A in position 4, the feedback for A might not reflect the position 4 A correctly? Let me recall the rules for duplicates.

Typically in Wordle, if there are duplicate letters, it can be a bit tricky. The feedback only considers one occurrence per target letter. So if you guess a letter with one occurrence, and the target has two, then:
- If you guess one in the correct position, you get a check for that position.
- If you guess one in the wrong position, you get a dash.
- The second occurrence in the target might not get any feedback if you didn't guess it.

In guess 3: ""ample"" = A,M,P,L,E
If the target word has an A in position 4, but position 4 is filled with L in our guess. So we guess L at position 4, and if there is an A at position 4, it should but we don't have that because we put L there.

If the word is ""LARGE"" but R is absent.

There's an example: suppose the word is ""LEAVE"". But E is at position 5, and L is at position 4? ""LEAVE"" is L,E,A,V,E: positions 1=L,2=E,3=A,4=V,5=E. But we have L in position 4 in our feedback? Not matching.

Let's list the known fixed letters: position 4 is L, position 5 is E.

So the word must be _ _ _ L E

And it has at least one A.

From guess 1, when we put A in position 2 (in ""crane""), we got a dash, meaning A is in the word but not in position 2. Therefore, A is in position 1 or 3? But from guess 2 and 3, we got dashes for A in position 3 and 1.

So if the word has only one A, we have a contradiction.

Therefore, the word must have two A's: one in position 1,2, or3 and the other in a position we haven't ruled out? But we've ruled out all positions.

Unless we consider that in a position where we have a dash, it doesn't mean there isn't also the same letter in the correct position; it just means that the specific occurrence we guessed is not correct.

But for position 1: in guess 3, we guessed A in position 1 and got a dash. That means that there is an A in the word but not at position 1. Similarly for position 2 in guess 1 and position 3 in guess 2.

So for the word to have an A in position 1, it must be that when we guess position 1 with A, we get a check. But we got a dash, so position 1 is not A.

Similarly, position 2 is not A, position 3 is not A.

But then A must be in position 4 or 5. But position 4 is L, position 5 is E, so they are not A.

We must conclude that feedback is for a different occurrence.

For instance, suppose the word is ""e.g., KARMA"" but doesn't end with E.

We need to assume that the word has an A in a position we haven't guessed. But we have! We guessed all positions in aggregate.

Position 4 and 5 are set to L and E, but if the word has an A in position 4, then how come in guess 3, we got L for position 4 check? That would only happen if position 4 is L, not A.

Position 5 is E.

So the only hope is that the word has two A's: one in position 1,2, or3 and the other in position 4 or5 but position 4 and5 are fixed to L and E, so not.

Unless position 4 is A and L is in a different position? But we have a check for L in position 4 in guess 3.

I think the only way is to accept that the word has an A in one of positions 1-3, but our dashes are because there might be a second A that is in the correct position, but we haven't guessed that position with A.

But we have guessed each position with A at least once.

Perhaps for guess 3, the feedback for A(dash) means that there is another A in the word not in position 1, but it could be in position 2,3,4,5.

But position 4 is L, so not A; position 5 is E, so not.

So in guess 3, the dash for A could only come from an A in position 2 or 3.

But in guess 1, when we put A in position 2, we got a dash, which doesn't prevent the word from having an A in position 3, for example.

In guess 2, when we put A in position 3, we got a dash.

So it's possible that there is an A in position 2 and another in position 3, and when we put A in position 2, we get a dash for that specific A, but the A in position 3 might not be acknowledged because we didn't guess it there? But in guess 1, we had A in position 2, and the word has A in position 2 and 3. Then the feedback would have: position 2 would be dash or check? If the word has A in position 2, and we guess A in position 2, it should be a check. But it was a dash, so position 2 is not A.

Similarly, position 3 is not A in guess 2.

So we go back to square one.

Perhaps there's a mistake in the assumed positions.

Let's output what we know:
- The word is in the form: [letter1] [letter2] [letter3] L E

Now, from guess 1: ""crane"" was C R A N E -> feedback A(dash) for position 3? No, ""crane"" has A in position 3? Let's index ""crane"":
C(1), R(2), A(3), N(4), E(5)

Feedback for A: dash, and it was position 3.

Similarly, ""slate"": S(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5) -> A dash, position 3? No, in ""slate"", A is in position 3? ""slate"": S1, L2, A3, T4, E5.

But in guess 2, we have A in position 3, and feedback dash, so A not in position 3.

But in guess 1, ""crane"": positions C1, R2, A3, N4, E5. Feedback A in position 3: dash. So A not in position 3.

And in guess 3, ""ample"": A1, M2, P3, L4, E5. Feedback A in position 1: dash, so A not in position 1.

Also, from guess 2: L in position 2, feedback dash for L, so L not in position 2.

But we have since learned that L is in position 4.

So for letter 2: we haven't discovered it yet.

Possible locations for A: position 2. because position 1,3 are ruled out, position 4 and5 are taken.

Position 2 is still unknown.

In guess 1, we had R in position 2, which was absent. In guess 2, we had L in position 2, which was dash (meaning L is in the word but not there). In guess 3, we had M in position 2, absent.

So position 2 could be A? But we have never put A in position 2 after the first guess? In guess 1, we put A in position 3, not in position 2. Guess 1: position 2 was R, which was absent. We haven't tested A in position 2 since the first guess? In guess 1, position 2 was R, not A.

Oh! This is key. In guess 1, ""crane"", we put A in position 3. We didn't put A in position 2 in any guess after that. In guess 2, we put A in position 3, in guess 3 in position 1.

So we have never tested position 2 with A. Therefore, it is possible that A is in position 2.

In the first guess, when we put R in position 2 and got 'x', that means R is absent, not that position 2 cannot be A.

We tested position 2 with R in guess 1 (absent), with L in guess 2 (dash, L is present but not there), and with M in guess 3 (absent). We haven't put A in position 2.

So it is possible that position 2 is A.

But in guess 2, when we put L in position 2, we got a dash for L, meaning L is in the word but not in position 2. That doesn't say anything about A.

So for A, it could be in position 2.

Let's check the feedback for A. In all three guesses, we got a dash for A, but that only means that the A we guessed is not in the correct position, but there could be another A that is in the correct position which we haven't guessed.

For example, if the word has A in position 2, and in guess 1 we put A in position 3 (so then we got a dash for position 3 A because it's not in position 3 but there is an A in position 2).

Similarly, in guess 2, we put A in position 3, and there is an A in position 2, so dash because it's not correct position for that instance.

In guess 3, we put A in position 1, and there is an A in position 2, so dash for position 1.

Moreover, position 2 hasn't been tested with A.

Therefore, it is possible that A is in position 2.

Let's assume that.

So the word is: [letter1] A [letter3] L E

Now, we know from previous feedback that the word contains A and L and E, and we know not C, R, N, S, T, M, P.

Also, for Guess 2: ""slate"" had L in position 2, which was dash. But if the word has L in position 4, so that's fine.

We need to find letter1 and letter3, which are neither A nor L nor E, and not in the absent list.

Absent letters: C,R,N,S,T,M,P

So letters available: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Now, what words fit this pattern: ? A ? L E

Examples:
- ""BAYLE"" not word.
- ""HABLE"" not common? Have ""gable"", but G is allowed? ""GABLE"": G A B L E
- ""TABLE"": T is absent, not allowed.
- ""BAYLE"" not.
- ""KABUL"" ends with L, but not E.

With E at the end: ""cable"" has C, absent.
 ""fable"": F A B L E
 ""gable"": G A B L E
 ""sable"": S is absent.
 ""label"": L in position 1, but we have A in position 2, and position 3 would be B, position 4 L, so ""label"" is L A B E L? 5 letters: L A B E L? ""label"" is L-A-B-E-L, so positions 1=L,2=A,3=B,4=E,5=L. But we need position 4 to be L and 5 to be E.

Our word is ? A ? L E, so position 4 and 5 are L and E.

For ""gable"": G(1) A(2) B(3) L(4) E(5) -- this fits.

Similarly, ""fable"" : F(1) A(2) B(3) L(4) E(5)

Now, we need to check against feedback.

In guess 1: ""crane"" - C R A N E -> feedback for position 3=A: dash. If the word is ""fable"", then A is in position 2. When we guess position 3 with A, it should be a dash because the correct A is in position 2. So it matches.

In guess 2: ""slate"" - S L A T E -> positions: S1, L2, A3, T4, E5. Feedback: S absent (correct), L dash (because our word has L in position 4, not 2), A dash (because A is in position 2, not 3), T absent (correct), E correct.

In guess 3: ""ample"" - A1, M2, P3, L4, E5. Feedback: A dash (because A is in position 2, not 1), M absent, P absent, L correct, E correct.

So ""fable"" and ""gable"" are candidates, with ' Fable ' using F and B, ' Gable ' using G and B.

Both B, F, G are not in the absent list.

Now, we need to choose one or test.

We can guess either, but we have few tries left.

Perhaps guess ""fable"" or ""gable"".

But there could be other words.

 like ""nable"" not a word.

""TABLE"" has T, absent.

""KABEL"" may not be common.

 So mainly ""fable"" and ""gable"".

We can also test with a word that has new letters.

But we only have two positions: letter1 and letter3.

The next guess should be to discriminate between possible words.

But first, we can guess one of them.

Or use a guess that tests multiple possibilities.

For example, use a word that has B in position 3 to confirm.

But we don't have many options.

Since both ""fable"" and ""gable"" have B in position 3, if we can confirm B is in the word, then either could be it.

But we have no information about B.

Conversely, if we want to test letter1, we can use a guess that has different letters.

But the only other letters in position 1 for such words are like ""cable"" (C absent), ""sable"" (S absent), so only ""fable"" and ""gable"" and perhaps ""hable"" not word.

Or ""DABLE"" not common, ""ABLE' is 4.

So only ""fable"" and ""gable"".

We can guess one.

 or use a word that  2 to test for G or F.

But with our known pattern, it's hard to find a guess that tests letter1 and letter3.

We are sure that position 2 is A, position 4 is L, position 5 is E.

We only need positions 1 and 3.

In our guess, for positions 1 and 3, we can put any letters but avoid absent letters and using the present letters in incorrect positions? We know A and L and E are present, but they are fixed except for positions 1 and 3.

For the guess, we need to use a valid word.

We can guess ""fable"" with F in position 1 and B in position 3.

If the word is ""fable"", it should be all correct.

If not, then it might be ""gable"".

So let's guess ""fable"".

Or ""gable"" similarly.

To be systematic, we can choose ""fable"" first.

But let's see the remaining absent letters include F and G? We haven't tested them, so they might be present or not.

By guessing ""fable"", if we get feedback that F and B are correct, it is the word. If not, then we know F is not in position 1 or B not in position 3, and we can try ""gable"" next.

Since we have 3 tries left (guess 4,5,6 out of 6), we can do that.

So I'll guess ""fable"".

### Key Insights
1. **Fixed positions**:  
   - Position 4 is **L** (from Guess 3).  
   - Position 5 is **E** (consistent in all guesses).  
2. **A is present**:  
   - Ruled out of positions 1, 2 (inferred from feedback), and 3.  
   - Only position 2 is untested for A. Must be in position 2 (as positions 1, 3, 4 (L), and 5 (E) are invalid).  
3. **Absent letters**: C, R, N, S, T, M, P (cannot be used).  
4. **Word structure**: The word is `[LETTER1] A [LETTER3] L E`.  
   - `LETTER1` and `LETTER3` must be from the remaining letters (not absent).  
5. **Candidate words**:  
   - **FABLE**: F (position 1), A (position 2), B (position 3), L (position 4), E (position 5).  
   - **GABLE**: G (position 1), A (position 2), B (position 3), L (position 4), E (position 5).
