We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we should choose a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the secret word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the secret word)
- N: x (not in the secret word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"". 
  Specifically, R is not the second letter, and E is not the fifth letter.
- The letters C, A, and N are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word must include R and E, and exclude C, A, N.

We have 6 tries, and this is our second guess.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain C, A, or N.
- Contains R and E (since they are present in the word, but we know they are not in the positions we tried).
- We also want to test new letters to get more information.

Since R and E are in the word, we should try to place them in different positions than the first guess.

In ""crane"", R was in position 2 and E in position 5. So in the new guess, we should avoid putting R in position 2 and E in position 5.

We also know that the word does not have C, A, N.

Let's think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N.

Common letters we haven't tried: we can try to include other vowels and common consonants.

We have 3 more letters to choose (since we must include R and E, and we have 5 positions). We should avoid repeating the absent letters.

Possible words: 
- We can try words that have R and E, and use other common letters like T, S, L, O, I, D, etc.

Let's consider the positions:
- We know R is not at position 2, so we can try R in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- We know E is not at position 5, so we can try E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

But note: we don't know if R and E are the only letters we have so far. There might be more.

We should try to cover as many new positions and letters as possible.

One strategy is to try a word that has R and E in different positions and includes other common letters.

For example, let's try the word ""ROLES"":
- R in position 1 (which is a new position for R, since previously it was in position 2 and now we avoid that)
- E in position 4 (previously it was in position 5, so this is a new position)

But wait, we must check if ""ROLES"" is valid. It is a valid English word.

However, note that we have not tested the letter O, L, S.

But let's see: we are avoiding C, A, N, so that's good.

Alternatively, we could try ""TRIED"":
- T, R, I, E, D
- R is in position 2? But wait, in the first guess R was in position 2 and we got a '-' meaning it is in the word but not in that position. So we cannot put R in position 2 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we already know it's not there. However, the feedback for position 2 in the first guess was for the letter R and we know it's not there. So if we put R in position 2 again, we would get a '-' again, which doesn't give new information about the position. So it's better to try R in a new position.

In ""TRIED"", R is in position 2 again. That might not be optimal.

Another word: ""STREP"" - but it has 5 letters? S-T-R-E-P. But we don't know if P is in the word. Also, we have S and T which are new.

But note: we have to avoid A, C, N. ""STREP"" doesn't have those.

However, we have E in position 4 (which is new) and R in position 3 (new position). Also, we get to test S, T, P.

But ""STREP"" might not be a very common word. We can choose a more common word.

Another idea: ""ROUSE"" - R at position 1, E at position 5? But wait, in the first guess E was at position 5 and we got a '-' meaning E is in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at position 5 again, we would get a '-' again. So we should avoid putting E at position 5.

Therefore, in ""ROUSE"", E is at position 5 again -> not good.

Let's try ""REBEL"": 
- R at position 1, E at position 2 and 4. But we have two E's? The secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know. But we can try. However, we have B and L as new letters. But note: we have E at position 2 and 4. We know E is in the word but not at position 5, but we don't know about position 2 and 4. However, we are using two E's which might be overkill if the word has only one E.

Alternatively, ""DRIVE"": 
- D, R, I, V, E
- R at position 2? We want to avoid position 2 for R? Actually, we can try a different position. In ""DRIVE"", R is at position 2 again -> not ideal.

We need a word with R not in position 2 and E not in position 5.

Let me think of words that have R and E, with R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 and E in position 1,2,3,4.

For example:
- Position 1: R, then we need E in one of 2,3,4 and then other letters.
- Words: ""RESET"" -> but has E twice and T. Also, E at position 2 and 5? But we cannot have E at position 5. So avoid.

""RODEO"" -> but has O and D, but no E? Wait, we need E.

""RIPER"" -> has duplicate R and E, and ends with R? But 5 letters: R-I-P-E-R. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have P and I.

But let's avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.

Another word: ""RIVET"" -> R at 1, E at 4? Then I, V, T. 
- R in position 1 (new)
- E in position 4 (new, since previously it was in 5)
- Letters: R, I, V, E, T -> all new except R and E.

This seems good. We test I, V, T.

But is ""RIVET"" a valid word? Yes.

Alternatively, ""ROVER"": 
- R at 1, E at 4? But then O, V, R. And R at the end? But we have two R's? We don't know if the word has two R's. Also, we are repeating R in position 1 and 5? But we already know R is in the word, so having two R's might not be efficient.

So ""RIVET"" seems better.

Another option: ""RISER"" -> again duplicate R and E.

Or ""RIDER"" -> duplicate R.

We want to avoid duplicates if possible.

Another word: ""ROBES"" -> R at 1, E at 5? But we cannot put E at 5 because we know it's not there. So avoid.

""RICES"" -> but has C? We know C is not in the word. So we cannot use C.

We must avoid C, A, N.

So ""RIVET"" is acceptable: R, I, V, E, T.

We can also consider ""TIGER"": 
- T at 1, I at 2, G at 3, E at 4, R at 5.
- R is at position 5 (new) and E at position 4 (new). 
- We test T, I, G, and we already know R and E are in the word.

But we don't know if G is in the word. Also, we avoid C, A, N.

""TIGER"" is a common word.

Alternatively, ""POWER"": 
- P, O, W, E, R -> E at 4, R at 5. 
- But we are putting R at 5 and E at 4. 
- We test P, O, W.

But we have to see if we can get more coverage.

Another word: ""LOSER"" -> L, O, S, E, R. 
- E at position 4? But then R at position 5. 
- We test L, O, S.

But note: we have E at 4 and R at 5. We know E is not at 5, but we don't know about 4. Similarly, R is not at 2, but we don't know about 5.

So ""LOSER"" is an option.

But let's compare:

We want to maximize the number of new letters and positions.

In ""RIVET"": we test R (in position 1, which is new), I (new), V (new), E (in position 4, new), T (new). 
- We are using R and E, and testing three new letters: I, V, T.

In ""TIGER"": T (new), I (new), G (new), E (position 4, new), R (position 5, new). 
- Similarly, three new letters: T, I, G.

In ""LOSER"": L (new), O (new), S (new), E (position 4, new), R (position 5, new). 
- Three new letters: L, O, S.

All are valid.

But note: we have not tested S, T, L, O, etc. So any of these are fine.

I think ""TIGER"" is a good choice because it has common letters.

But let me check if there's a word that uses more common letters.

Another word: ""STORE"" -> S, T, O, R, E. 
- R at position 4? and E at position 5? But we know E is not at position 5. So we cannot use E at 5.

So avoid.

""STIRE"" is not a word.

""ROUTE"" -> R at 1, E at 5? Avoid.

""RESTY"" -> R at 1, E at 2, S, T, Y. 
- E at position 2? We don't know if E can be at 2. 
- But we avoid A, C, N. 
- We test S, T, Y.

But Y is less common.

I think ""TIGER"" or ""RIVET"" are good.

I'll go with ""TIGER"" because it's a very common word.

So the second guess: ""TIGER""

But let's write it: T-I-G-E-R.

Positions:
- T: position 1
- I: position 2
- G: position 3
- E: position 4
- R: position 5

We are avoiding the known bad positions: R is not at position 2 (we are putting it at 5) and E is not at 5 (we are putting it at 4). So that's good.

We are also testing three new letters: T, I, G.

So we can get more information.

Therefore, the second guess is ""tiger"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and N are **not** in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- R and E **are** in the secret word but in the wrong positions (marked with ""-""). Specifically, R is not in position 2, and E is not in position 5.

For the second guess:
- The word must include R and E (since they are confirmed present), but avoid placing R in position 2 or E in position 5.
- It must exclude C, A, and N (since they are absent).
- To maximize new information, I chose a word with common unused letters (T, I, G) and positioned R and E in new locations (R at position 5, E at position 4).
- ""TIGER"" is a valid 5-letter word that meets these criteria and tests new letters.

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,LEMUR,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we should choose a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the secret word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the secret word)
- N: x (not in the secret word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"". 
  Specifically, R is not the second letter, and E is not the fifth letter.
- The letters C, A, and N are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word must include R and E, and exclude C, A, N.

We have 6 tries, and this is our second guess.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain C, A, or N.
- Contains R and E (since they are present in the word, but we know they are not in the positions we tried).
- We also want to test new letters to get more information.

Since R and E are in the word, we should try to place them in different positions than the first guess.

In ""crane"", R was in position 2 and E in position 5. So in the new guess, we should avoid putting R in position 2 and E in position 5.

We also know that the word does not have C, A, N.

Let's think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N.

Common letters we haven't tried: we can try to include other vowels and common consonants.

We have 3 more letters to choose (since we must include R and E, and we have 5 positions). We should avoid repeating the absent letters.

Possible words: 
- We can try words that have R and E, and use other common letters like T, S, L, O, I, D, etc.

Let's consider the positions:
- We know R is not at position 2, so we can try R in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- We know E is not at position 5, so we can try E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

But note: we don't know if R and E are the only letters we have so far. There might be more.

We should try to cover as many new positions and letters as possible.

One strategy is to try a word that has R and E in different positions and includes other common letters.

For example, let's try the word ""ROLES"":
- R in position 1 (which is a new position for R, since previously it was in position 2 and now we avoid that)
- E in position 4 (previously it was in position 5, so this is a new position)

But wait, we must check if ""ROLES"" is valid. It is a valid English word.

However, note that we have not tested the letter O, L, S.

But let's see: we are avoiding C, A, N, so that's good.

Alternatively, we could try ""TRIED"":
- T, R, I, E, D
- R is in position 2? But wait, in the first guess R was in position 2 and we got a '-' meaning it is in the word but not in that position. So we cannot put R in position 2 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we already know it's not there. However, the feedback for position 2 in the first guess was for the letter R and we know it's not there. So if we put R in position 2 again, we would get a '-' again, which doesn't give new information about the position. So it's better to try R in a new position.

In ""TRIED"", R is in position 2 again. That might not be optimal.

Another word: ""STREP"" - but it has 5 letters? S-T-R-E-P. But we don't know if P is in the word. Also, we have S and T which are new.

But note: we have to avoid A, C, N. ""STREP"" doesn't have those.

However, we have E in position 4 (which is new) and R in position 3 (new position). Also, we get to test S, T, P.

But ""STREP"" might not be a very common word. We can choose a more common word.

Another idea: ""ROUSE"" - R at position 1, E at position 5? But wait, in the first guess E was at position 5 and we got a '-' meaning E is in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at position 5 again, we would get a '-' again. So we should avoid putting E at position 5.

Therefore, in ""ROUSE"", E is at position 5 again -> not good.

Let's try ""REBEL"": 
- R at position 1, E at position 2 and 4. But we have two E's? The secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know. But we can try. However, we have B and L as new letters. But note: we have E at position 2 and 4. We know E is in the word but not at position 5, but we don't know about position 2 and 4. However, we are using two E's which might be overkill if the word has only one E.

Alternatively, ""DRIVE"": 
- D, R, I, V, E
- R at position 2? We want to avoid position 2 for R? Actually, we can try a different position. In ""DRIVE"", R is at position 2 again -> not ideal.

We need a word with R not in position 2 and E not in position 5.

Let me think of words that have R and E, with R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 and E in position 1,2,3,4.

For example:
- Position 1: R, then we need E in one of 2,3,4 and then other letters.
- Words: ""RESET"" -> but has E twice and T. Also, E at position 2 and 5? But we cannot have E at position 5. So avoid.

""RODEO"" -> but has O and D, but no E? Wait, we need E.

""RIPER"" -> has duplicate R and E, and ends with R? But 5 letters: R-I-P-E-R. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have P and I.

But let's avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.

Another word: ""RIVET"" -> R at 1, E at 4? Then I, V, T. 
- R in position 1 (new)
- E in position 4 (new, since previously it was in 5)
- Letters: R, I, V, E, T -> all new except R and E.

This seems good. We test I, V, T.

But is ""RIVET"" a valid word? Yes.

Alternatively, ""ROVER"": 
- R at 1, E at 4? But then O, V, R. And R at the end? But we have two R's? We don't know if the word has two R's. Also, we are repeating R in position 1 and 5? But we already know R is in the word, so having two R's might not be efficient.

So ""RIVET"" seems better.

Another option: ""RISER"" -> again duplicate R and E.

Or ""RIDER"" -> duplicate R.

We want to avoid duplicates if possible.

Another word: ""ROBES"" -> R at 1, E at 5? But we cannot put E at 5 because we know it's not there. So avoid.

""RICES"" -> but has C? We know C is not in the word. So we cannot use C.

We must avoid C, A, N.

So ""RIVET"" is acceptable: R, I, V, E, T.

We can also consider ""TIGER"": 
- T at 1, I at 2, G at 3, E at 4, R at 5.
- R is at position 5 (new) and E at position 4 (new). 
- We test T, I, G, and we already know R and E are in the word.

But we don't know if G is in the word. Also, we avoid C, A, N.

""TIGER"" is a common word.

Alternatively, ""POWER"": 
- P, O, W, E, R -> E at 4, R at 5. 
- But we are putting R at 5 and E at 4. 
- We test P, O, W.

But we have to see if we can get more coverage.

Another word: ""LOSER"" -> L, O, S, E, R. 
- E at position 4? But then R at position 5. 
- We test L, O, S.

But note: we have E at 4 and R at 5. We know E is not at 5, but we don't know about 4. Similarly, R is not at 2, but we don't know about 5.

So ""LOSER"" is an option.

But let's compare:

We want to maximize the number of new letters and positions.

In ""RIVET"": we test R (in position 1, which is new), I (new), V (new), E (in position 4, new), T (new). 
- We are using R and E, and testing three new letters: I, V, T.

In ""TIGER"": T (new), I (new), G (new), E (position 4, new), R (position 5, new). 
- Similarly, three new letters: T, I, G.

In ""LOSER"": L (new), O (new), S (new), E (position 4, new), R (position 5, new). 
- Three new letters: L, O, S.

All are valid.

But note: we have not tested S, T, L, O, etc. So any of these are fine.

I think ""TIGER"" is a good choice because it has common letters.

But let me check if there's a word that uses more common letters.

Another word: ""STORE"" -> S, T, O, R, E. 
- R at position 4? and E at position 5? But we know E is not at position 5. So we cannot use E at 5.

So avoid.

""STIRE"" is not a word.

""ROUTE"" -> R at 1, E at 5? Avoid.

""RESTY"" -> R at 1, E at 2, S, T, Y. 
- E at position 2? We don't know if E can be at 2. 
- But we avoid A, C, N. 
- We test S, T, Y.

But Y is less common.

I think ""TIGER"" or ""RIVET"" are good.

I'll go with ""TIGER"" because it's a very common word.

So the second guess: ""TIGER""

But let's write it: T-I-G-E-R.

Positions:
- T: position 1
- I: position 2
- G: position 3
- E: position 4
- R: position 5

We are avoiding the known bad positions: R is not at position 2 (we are putting it at 5) and E is not at 5 (we are putting it at 4). So that's good.

We are also testing three new letters: T, I, G.

So we can get more information.

Therefore, the second guess is ""tiger"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and N are **not** in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- R and E **are** in the secret word but in the wrong positions (marked with ""-""). Specifically, R is not in position 2, and E is not in position 5.

For the second guess:
- The word must include R and E (since they are confirmed present), but avoid placing R in position 2 or E in position 5.
- It must exclude C, A, and N (since they are absent).
- To maximize new information, I chose a word with common unused letters (T, I, G) and positioned R and E in new locations (R at position 5, E at position 4).
- ""TIGER"" is a valid 5-letter word that meets these criteria and tests new letters.

We have feedback from two guesses:

1. From ""crane"":
   - C: absent (x)
   - R: present but wrong position (-) → so R is in the word, not at position 2
   - A: absent (x)
   - N: absent (x)
   - E: present but wrong position (-) → so E is in the word, not at position 5

2. From ""tiger"":
   - T: absent (x)
   - I: absent (x)
   - G: absent (x)
   - E: present but wrong position (-) → E is in the word, but not at position 4 (since we put it at position 4 and got '-')
   - R: correct (✓) → so R is at position 5 (since in ""tiger"", R is at position 5)

Combining the feedback:

- Confirmed letters:
  - R is in the word and is at position 5 (from guess 2: R✓).
  - E is in the word but not at position 4 or 5 (from guess 1: E not at 5; from guess 2: E not at 4).

- Absent letters: C, A, N, T, I, G (from both guesses).

- Therefore, we know:
  - Position 5 is R.
  - E is present but not in position 4 or 5, so it must be in one of the positions 1, 2, or 3.

- Also, we have eliminated letters: C, A, N, T, I, G.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Has E in position 1, 2, or 3.
- Has R at position 5.
- Does not contain any of: C, A, N, T, I, G.

We also want to test other positions and new letters.

Since E can be in positions 1, 2, or 3, we should try to place E in a new position that we haven't tested yet. We have only tested E in positions 5 (from ""crane"") and 4 (from ""tiger""). So positions 1, 2, 3 are untested for E.

We should consider common letters that haven't been eliminated. So available letters: all except C, A, N, T, I, G.

Common consonants left: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Common vowels left: E, O, U (but E is already used, and O, U are available)

We know E is in the word, so we must include it.

Let's think of words that end with R (position 5) and contain E.

Possible structures:

- E at position 1: E _ _ _ R
- E at position 2: _ E _ _ R
- E at position 3: _ _ E _ R

We need to fill the blanks with letters not in the absent set.

Also, we have not tested positions 1, 2, 3, and 4 (except we know position 4 in the second guess had E which is not there, but we don't know about other letters in position 4).

We should introduce new common letters to gather more information.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, L, O, U, B, D, etc.

Let's consider possibilities:

- If E is at position 1: ""E _ _ _ R"". Words like ""EAGER"" but A and G are absent → no. ""ELDER"" → E,L,D,E? No, 5 letters: E,L,D,E,R? But duplicate E? ""ELDER"" has two E's? Let's check: E,L,D,E,R? That would be E at 1 and 4? But we cannot have E at position 4? We know E is not at position 4 from the second guess. So if E is at position 4, it would be incorrect.

But note: ""ELDER"" has E at position 1 and 5? But position 5 is R, so not E. So ""ELDER"": E (position 1), L (2), D (3), E (4), R (5). But in the second guess, we learned that E is not at position 4. So we cannot have a word with E at position 4. Therefore, if we consider ""ELDER"", E at position 4 would be invalid.

So any word that would have E at position 4 is eliminated.

Therefore, E can only be at positions 1, 2, or 3.

Similarly, we must not have any letter that has been eliminated.

Now, let's try to come up with a valid third guess.

Option with E at position 1: 
  - Words: ""EMBER"", but M is new, B is new, but ""EMBER"": E,M,B,E,R → again E at position 1 and 4? Position 4 is E? But we cannot have E at 4. And also, duplicate E? But even if, position 4 E is forbidden. So ""EMBER"" has E at 4 → invalid.

""EVERY"" → E at 1 and 3? And Y. But let's spell: E,V,E,R,Y → positions: E at 1, V at 2, E at 3? Then R at 4? But we need R at 5. ""EVERY"" ends with Y? So positions: 1:E, 2:V, 3:E, 4:R? But we need position 5 R? So no. We need position 5 to be R.

So the word must end with R.

Examples: 
- ""E at 1"": ""EARLY"" → but A is absent. ""EARLY"" has A? E,A,R,L,Y → R is at position 3? But we need R at 5. So no.

""ENDU""? No.

Actually, few words with E at 1 and ending with R without A or other eliminated letters.

Let's try E at position 2: ""_ E _ _ R""

Examples: 
- ""LEPER"" → L,E,P,E,R → but E at position 4? We cannot have E at position 4 because we know E is not there. So invalid.

""BEFOG""? Invalid word.

""JESUS""? Not 5 ending with R.

""DEBAR"" → D,E,B,A,R → but A is absent.

""DEMUR"" → D,E,M,U,R → no A, no eliminated letters? U is allowed. So ""DEMUR"": 
  Positions: 1:D, 2:E, 3:M, 4:U, 5:R

But we have E at position 2? And we test D, M, U. And we avoid eliminated letters.

Is ""DEMUR"" a valid word? Yes, meaning to show reluctance.

But E is at position 2, which is an untested position.

Similarly, ""LEMUR"" → L,E,M,U,R → E at 2, ending with R? L,E,M,U,R → positions: 1:L, 2:E, 3:M, 4:U, 5:R → and E at 2.

""LEMUR"" is a common word (an animal).

Now, letters: L, E, M, U, R.

We haven't tested L, M, U.

Also, E at position 2, which is new.

But note: we must avoid placing E in position 4, which is safe here.

Another option: E at position 3: ""_ _ E _ R""

Examples: ""BOXER"" → B,O,X,E,R? But positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:X, but then E at 4? We cannot have E at 4. We need E at position 3, so the word should be ... ""a b E c R"" meaning: position 1: ?, 2: ?, 3: E, 4: ?, 5: R.

For example: ""HOVER"" → H,O,V,E,R → E at position 4? Not allowed because E cannot be at position 4. So we need a word without E at 4.

So: position 3 is E, then position 4 is some letter, position 5 is R.

We must choose a word where position 4 is not E? But we are placing E only at position 3? Then position 4 is another letter.

Example: ""USER"" → but that's 4 letters? ""QUEER"" → Q,U,E,E,R → has E at 3 and 4? Not allowed because E at 4 is forbidden.

""RUPEE"" → but R is at 1? And E at 4 and 5? But we need R at 5. And E at 4 is forbidden.

""PUREE"" → P,U,R,E,E → R at position 3? Then E at 4 and 5? But we need R at 5 and E at 4 is forbidden.

Proper word: ""FILER"" → F,I,L,E,R → I is eliminated? I is absent (from guess 2). 

""LONER"" → L,O,N,E,R → N is eliminated? Yes, absent.

""POWER"" → P,O,W,E,R → E at position 4? Forbidden.

""SUPER"" → S,U,P,E,R → E at position 4? Forbidden.

""BOXER"" is B,O,X,E,R → E at 4? Forbidden.

""MAKER"" → M,A,K,E,R → A eliminated.

So it seems harder for E at position 3 without having E elsewhere or using eliminated letters.

Another idea: ""FEWER"" → F,E,W,E,R → E at position 2 and 4? But E at 4 is forbidden.

Therefore, E at position 2 might be easier.

So let's focus on E at position 2: words like _ E _ _ R.

Possible words:
- ""LEMUR"": L,E,M,U,R → letters L, M, U are new.
- ""DEMUR"": D,E,M,U,R → same as above but with D instead of L.

We could also try ""SERER"" not familiar.

""LEVER"" → L,E,V,E,R → E in position 2 and 4? E at position 4 is forbidden.

""WEIRD"" → ends with D, not R.

""BERRY"" → B,E,R,R,Y → R at position 3 and 4? But we already have R at position 5? This word has three R's? And position 3 is R? But we don't know if duplicate R is allowed. Also, we need to test.

But in ""BERRY"": 
  - Position 1: B
  - Position 2: E
  - Position 3: R → but R is at position 5? We already know R is at position 5, so if we put R at position 3 and it's also at 5, that might be possible if the word has multiple R's? But the feedback didn't indicate multiple R's? Actually, we don't know.

But note: we haven't tested the letter R in position 3 yet. However, since we know R is at position 5, if we put R at position 3 and it is not in the word twice, we would get an 'x' or '-'? Actually, if the word has only one R, then at position 3 we might get 'x' if the R isn't elsewhere, but we know there is an R at position 5 so position 3 R might get '-' if there is another R? But it's messy.

To avoid complexity, perhaps we should avoid using extra R's.

Therefore, ""LEMUR"" and ""DEMUR"" are good candidates because they don't have duplicate E or R, and E is only at position 2.

Between ""LEMUR"" and ""DEMUR"", which is better? Both test three new letters.

We might choose the one that uses more common consonants.

L and S are very common, but in ""DEMUR"" we have D and M.

""LEMUR"" is an animal, ""DEMUR"" is a verb. Both are valid.

We could also try ""SEVER"" but S,E,V,E,R → E at position 2 and 4? Forbidden.

Or ""BEVER"" not a word.

Another word: ""FEZER"" not a word.

So I think ""LEMUR"" is a good choice.

Alternatively, to test S, we could try something else.

Another possibility: ""LEVEL"" but not ending with R.

Or ""REBEL"" but R at 1? And E at 2? Then B, E, L → E at 2 and 4? Forbidden.

What about ""WELSH""? No R.

Let me list some words ending with R that have E in position 2 and avoid E at position 4 and eliminated letters.

- ""LEMUR"": L, E, M, U, R
- ""DEMUR"": D, E, M, U, R
- ""LEGER"": L, E, G, E, R → G is eliminated? Yes, from guess 2: G is absent. So we cannot use G.
- ""BEVER"" not standard.
- ""METER"" → M,E,T,E,R → T is absent? And E at position 4? Forbidden.
- ""HEWER"": H,E,W,E,R → E at 2 and 4? Invalid.
- ""SEDER"" → S,E,D,E,R → E at 2 and 4? Invalid.

So only a few. ""LEMUR"" and ""DEMUR"" are the main ones.

Another: ""LEPER"" → L,E,P,E,R → E at position 4? Yes → invalid.

""LEVER"" → same issue.

So I think ""LEMUR"" is a solid choice.

Therefore, for the third guess, I'll choose ""LEMUR"".

It tests L, M, U (all new) and places E at position 2 (a position we haven't tested for E).

If E is actually at position 2, then we get E(✓) and more information.

If not, then we learn E is not at position 2 and we can focus on position 1 or 3.

Also, position 5 is R, so we are confirming that.

Therefore, the guess is ""LEMUR"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, T, I, G (from ""crane"" and ""tiger"" feedback). These letters cannot be in the secret word.
- **Present letters and positions**:
  - R is confirmed at position 5 (✓ from ""tiger"").
  - E is present but not at positions 4 or 5 (from ""tiger"" and ""crane"" feedback). So E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

For the new guess:
- The word must include E (in position 1, 2, or 3) and R at position 5.
- It must exclude C, A, N, T, I, G.
- To maximize new information, I chose a word with E in an untested position (position 2) and introduced new common letters (L, M, U) to test their presence and positions.
- ""LEMUR"" is a valid, common English word that fits these criteria:
  - E at position 2 (new position to test).
  - R at position 5 (confirmed).
  - New letters: L (position 1), M (position 3), U (position 4).

This guess will help determine the validity and positions of L, M, U and confirm/refute E's position.

<guess>lemur</guess>",lemur,"We have feedback from two guesses:

1. From ""crane"":
   - C: absent (x)
   - R: present but wrong position (-) → so R is in the word, not at position 2
   - A: absent (x)
   - N: absent (x)
   - E: present but wrong position (-) → so E is in the word, not at position 5

2. From ""tiger"":
   - T: absent (x)
   - I: absent (x)
   - G: absent (x)
   - E: present but wrong position (-) → E is in the word, but not at position 4 (since we put it at position 4 and got '-')
   - R: correct (✓) → so R is at position 5 (since in ""tiger"", R is at position 5)

Combining the feedback:

- Confirmed letters:
  - R is in the word and is at position 5 (from guess 2: R✓).
  - E is in the word but not at position 4 or 5 (from guess 1: E not at 5; from guess 2: E not at 4).

- Absent letters: C, A, N, T, I, G (from both guesses).

- Therefore, we know:
  - Position 5 is R.
  - E is present but not in position 4 or 5, so it must be in one of the positions 1, 2, or 3.

- Also, we have eliminated letters: C, A, N, T, I, G.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Has E in position 1, 2, or 3.
- Has R at position 5.
- Does not contain any of: C, A, N, T, I, G.

We also want to test other positions and new letters.

Since E can be in positions 1, 2, or 3, we should try to place E in a new position that we haven't tested yet. We have only tested E in positions 5 (from ""crane"") and 4 (from ""tiger""). So positions 1, 2, 3 are untested for E.

We should consider common letters that haven't been eliminated. So available letters: all except C, A, N, T, I, G.

Common consonants left: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Common vowels left: E, O, U (but E is already used, and O, U are available)

We know E is in the word, so we must include it.

Let's think of words that end with R (position 5) and contain E.

Possible structures:

- E at position 1: E _ _ _ R
- E at position 2: _ E _ _ R
- E at position 3: _ _ E _ R

We need to fill the blanks with letters not in the absent set.

Also, we have not tested positions 1, 2, 3, and 4 (except we know position 4 in the second guess had E which is not there, but we don't know about other letters in position 4).

We should introduce new common letters to gather more information.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, L, O, U, B, D, etc.

Let's consider possibilities:

- If E is at position 1: ""E _ _ _ R"". Words like ""EAGER"" but A and G are absent → no. ""ELDER"" → E,L,D,E? No, 5 letters: E,L,D,E,R? But duplicate E? ""ELDER"" has two E's? Let's check: E,L,D,E,R? That would be E at 1 and 4? But we cannot have E at position 4? We know E is not at position 4 from the second guess. So if E is at position 4, it would be incorrect.

But note: ""ELDER"" has E at position 1 and 5? But position 5 is R, so not E. So ""ELDER"": E (position 1), L (2), D (3), E (4), R (5). But in the second guess, we learned that E is not at position 4. So we cannot have a word with E at position 4. Therefore, if we consider ""ELDER"", E at position 4 would be invalid.

So any word that would have E at position 4 is eliminated.

Therefore, E can only be at positions 1, 2, or 3.

Similarly, we must not have any letter that has been eliminated.

Now, let's try to come up with a valid third guess.

Option with E at position 1: 
  - Words: ""EMBER"", but M is new, B is new, but ""EMBER"": E,M,B,E,R → again E at position 1 and 4? Position 4 is E? But we cannot have E at 4. And also, duplicate E? But even if, position 4 E is forbidden. So ""EMBER"" has E at 4 → invalid.

""EVERY"" → E at 1 and 3? And Y. But let's spell: E,V,E,R,Y → positions: E at 1, V at 2, E at 3? Then R at 4? But we need R at 5. ""EVERY"" ends with Y? So positions: 1:E, 2:V, 3:E, 4:R? But we need position 5 R? So no. We need position 5 to be R.

So the word must end with R.

Examples: 
- ""E at 1"": ""EARLY"" → but A is absent. ""EARLY"" has A? E,A,R,L,Y → R is at position 3? But we need R at 5. So no.

""ENDU""? No.

Actually, few words with E at 1 and ending with R without A or other eliminated letters.

Let's try E at position 2: ""_ E _ _ R""

Examples: 
- ""LEPER"" → L,E,P,E,R → but E at position 4? We cannot have E at position 4 because we know E is not there. So invalid.

""BEFOG""? Invalid word.

""JESUS""? Not 5 ending with R.

""DEBAR"" → D,E,B,A,R → but A is absent.

""DEMUR"" → D,E,M,U,R → no A, no eliminated letters? U is allowed. So ""DEMUR"": 
  Positions: 1:D, 2:E, 3:M, 4:U, 5:R

But we have E at position 2? And we test D, M, U. And we avoid eliminated letters.

Is ""DEMUR"" a valid word? Yes, meaning to show reluctance.

But E is at position 2, which is an untested position.

Similarly, ""LEMUR"" → L,E,M,U,R → E at 2, ending with R? L,E,M,U,R → positions: 1:L, 2:E, 3:M, 4:U, 5:R → and E at 2.

""LEMUR"" is a common word (an animal).

Now, letters: L, E, M, U, R.

We haven't tested L, M, U.

Also, E at position 2, which is new.

But note: we must avoid placing E in position 4, which is safe here.

Another option: E at position 3: ""_ _ E _ R""

Examples: ""BOXER"" → B,O,X,E,R? But positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:X, but then E at 4? We cannot have E at 4. We need E at position 3, so the word should be ... ""a b E c R"" meaning: position 1: ?, 2: ?, 3: E, 4: ?, 5: R.

For example: ""HOVER"" → H,O,V,E,R → E at position 4? Not allowed because E cannot be at position 4. So we need a word without E at 4.

So: position 3 is E, then position 4 is some letter, position 5 is R.

""PUREE"" → P,U,R,E,E → R at position 3? Then E at 4 and 5? But we need R at 5 and E at 4 is forbidden.

Proper word: ""FILER"" → F,I,L,E,R → I is eliminated? I is absent (from guess 2). 

""LONER"" → L,O,N,E,R → N is eliminated? Yes, absent.

""POWER"" → P,O,W,E,R → E at position 4? Forbidden.

""SUPER"" → S,U,P,E,R → E at position 4? Forbidden.

""BOXER"" is B,O,X,E,R → E at 4? Forbidden.

""MAKER"" → M,A,K,E,R → A eliminated.

So it seems harder for E at position 3 without having E elsewhere or using eliminated letters.

Another idea: ""FEWER"" → F,E,W,E,R → E at position 2 and 4? But E at 4 is forbidden.

Therefore, E at position 2 might be easier.

So let's focus on E at position 2: words like _ E _ _ R.

Possible words:

- ""LEMUR"": L, E, M, U, R
- ""DEMUR"": D, E, M, U, R
- ""LEGER"": L, E, G, E, R → G is eliminated? Yes, from guess 2: G is absent. So we cannot use G.
