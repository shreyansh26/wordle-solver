We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to make an initial guess.
A good starting word typically has a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U
Common consonants: R, S, T, N, L, etc.

I recall that words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", ""RAISE"" are often recommended as starting words because they contain common letters.

Let me choose ""RAISE"" as the first guess: 
R, A, I, S, E

But note: the example in the rules used ""STORM"", ""BRAVE"", etc. So any valid 5-letter word is acceptable.

Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is a word that is sometimes used (meaning a rotation or variation of rate) but it's not very common. I think we should stick with common words.

Another popular choice is ""CRATE"".

I'll go with ""CRATE"": C, R, A, T, E.

Why?
- It has three common vowels: A, E, and one common consonant: R, T, C.

Let's verify ""CRATE"" is a valid word: Yes, meaning a container.

Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also good: S, L, A, T, E.

But I think ""CRATE"" is fine.

We are starting fresh. Since the first guess CRATE resulted in all letters incorrect (all 'x'), that means none of the letters C, R, A, T, or E are in the secret word.
Therefore, the secret word must be composed of letters from the remaining alphabet, excluding C, R, A, T, E.

We need to choose a new five-letter word that does not contain any of these letters: C, R, A, T, E.

Let's think of common vowels and consonants we haven't used. Vowels left: O, I, U (since A and E are excluded). Consonants: many left like S, L, N, B, D, etc.

A good starting word should cover common letters that haven't been tried. After eliminating C,R,A,T,E, frequent letters include O, I, S, L, N.

For example, ""OIL"" is common but we need five letters. How about ""SOLID""? Let's check: 
S, O, L, I, D. None of these are in the forbidden set.

But we want maximum information. Another option: ""LOINS"" but let's stick with common words.

Alternatively, ""POINT"" has P,O,I,N,T but T is used? Wait, T is excluded because first guess had T and it was not in the word. So avoid T.

Similarly avoid C,R,A,T,E.

So for ""SOLID"": 
S, O, L, I, D — none forbidden.

But is there a word with more common letters? How about using U? Words like ""SOULS"" or ""LOUSE"", but let's think.

Another popular second guess after eliminating some vowels might be something like ""PIOUS"", but let's see.

Since we know A, E, R, T are absent, which are very common, we must focus on other vowels: O, I, U.

I think ""OUIJA"" is not common and has repeated letters? We want distinct letters if possible.

""SOLID"" seems reasonable: consonants S,L,D and vowels O,I.

Other possibilities: ""MOUND"", ""BOUND"" — but let's avoid B and D if we can? We don't know yet.

Actually, we need a word with only letters not in {C,R,A,T,E}.

Available letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Common letters left: S, O, L, I, N, etc.

A word like ""SLING"": S,L,I,N,G — but G is less common.

Or ""SPOIL"": S,P,O,I,L.

But P is less common than others? Let's aim for high frequency letters.

According to letter frequency in English, after removing C,R,A,T,E, the most common remaining letters are O,I,S,L,N.

So a word that uses O,I,S,L,N would be good. But can we form a five-letter word using these? Yes, ""LIONS"" — L,I,O,N,S.

""LIONS"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""NOILS"" is not common, but ""LOINS"" is — same as LIONS but LOINS is a word.

Either is fine. Let's use ""LOINS"": L,O,I,N,S.

But ""S"" is included, and we have O,I,N,L,S.

Another option: ""SOILY"" is not a word? How about ""SOULS"" but U and S repeated? Better to avoid repeats.

""PINOT"" is a wine word, but T is excluded? T is excluded.

So ""LOINS"": 
L, O, I, N, S — all distinct and not forbidden.

Similarly, ""OILNS"" isn't a word. ""LINOS"" might not be common.

I think ""LOINS"" is acceptable.

Alternatives: 
""MOIST"": M,O,I,S,T but T is excluded? Yes, T is in the forbidden set? First guess had T and it was not in the word, so avoid T.

Similarly, ""FOIST"" has F and T — avoid T.

So ""LOINS"" seems good.

Another word: ""SOUND"" — S,O,U,N,D — U and D are available.

But D and U are not as common as S,O,I,N,L.

Since S,L,I are frequent, and O,N too, ""LOINS"" covers L,O,I,N,S — that's five of the top remaining.

Perhaps ""SPOON"" but repeats O and we avoid repeat letters in early guesses to get more info.

But ""LOINS"" has no repeats.

We could consider ""POUND"" or ""MOUND"" but let's see.

I think ""LOINS"" is a valid and good choice.

But let me confirm: is ""LOINS"" a valid Scrabble word? Yes, it means the lower part of the abdomen.

To be safe, another common word: ""NOISY"" — N,O,I,S,Y — Y is available? Yes, and it's common enough.

But Y is a semivowel, and in word games, it can be useful.

Similarly, ""SHINY"" — S,H,I,N,Y — but H is less common.

Since we have all letters wrong in first guess, we want to cover new ground.

I think ""LOINS"" or ""NOISY"" — both are fine.

But ""LOINS"" has L instead of Y. L is more common than Y.

Letter frequency in English words: after removing C,R,A,T,E, the most common are:
O, I, N, S, L, D, U, M, P, H, etc.

So L is more common than Y.

But both guesses are acceptable.

Let's pick ""LOINS"".

So the next guess will be ""LOINS"".

But we must make sure the word is valid. I believe ""LOINS"" is acceptable.

To be safer, I can choose ""PILOT"" but T is excluded? First feedback: T(x) in CRATE, so T is not in the word, avoid.

""OILED"" has D and E? E is excluded.

So yes, ""LOINS"" is good.

Therefore, my guess is LOINS.

Returning in the format: <guess>LOINS</guess>
</think>
After the feedback from the first guess ""CRATE"", where all letters (C, R, A, T, E) were marked as absent (x), it means none of these letters appear in the secret word. Therefore, the secret word must consist of letters from the remaining alphabet, excluding C, R, A, T, E.

To maximize information gain:
- The new guess should avoid using any of the excluded letters: C, R, A, T, E.
- It should include common letters that haven't been tried yet. After removing C, R, A, T, E, the most frequently occurring letters in English words are O, I, S, L, N, D, U, M, P, etc.
- To cover a broad range of possibilities, words with high-frequency letters and no repeats are preferred for early guesses.
- Possible words considered: 
  - ""LOINS"" (valid word; uses L, O, I, N, S—covering 5 high-frequency letters without duplicates).
  - ""SOLID"" (valid word; uses S, O, L, I, D—D has a moderate frequency).
  - ""SOUND"" (valid word; uses S, O, U, N, D—includes U, which is less common).
  - ""POUND"" (valid word; P, O, U, N, D—includes P and U, which are less frequent).
- ""LOINS"" was selected because it contains O, I, S, N, L—all appearing in the top 7 of the remaining letter frequencies—and has no repeated letters, offering efficient coverage of new possibilities.

This guess will provide feedback to narrow down the word pool significantly.

Available letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Common letters left: S, O, L, I, N, etc.

A word like ""SLING"": S,L,I,N,G — but G is less common.

Or ""SPOIL"": S,P,O,I,L.

But P is less common than others? Let's aim for high frequency letters.

According to letter frequency in English, after removing C,R,A,T,E, the most common remaining letters are O,I,S,L,N.

So a word that uses O,I,S,L,N would be good. But can we form a five-letter word using these? Yes, ""LIONS"" — L,I,O,N,S.

""LIONS"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""NOILS"" is not common, but ""LOINS"" is — same as LIONS but LOINS is a word.

Either is fine. Let's use ""LOINS"": L,O,I,N,S.

But ""S"" is included, and we have O,I,N,L,S.

Another option: ""SOILY"" is not a word? How about ""SOULS"" but U and S repeated? Better to avoid repeats.

""PINOT"" is a wine word, but T is excluded? T is excluded.

So ""LOINS"": 
L, O, I, N, S — all distinct and not forbidden.

Similarly, ""OILNS"" isn't a word. ""LINOS"" might not be common.

I think ""LOINS"" is acceptable.

Alternatives: 
""MOIST"": M,O,I,S,T but T is excluded? Yes, T is in the forbidden set? First guess had T and it was not in the word, so avoid T.

Similarly, ""FOIST"" has F and T — avoid T.

So ""LOINS"" seems good.

Another word: ""SOUND"" — S,O,U,N,D — U and D are available.

But D and U are not as common as S,O,I,N,L.

Since S,L,I are frequent, and O,N too, ""LOINS"" covers L,O,I,N,S — that's five of the top remaining.

Perhaps ""SPOON"" but repeats O and we avoid repeat letters in early guesses to get more info.

But ""LOINS"" has no repeats.

We could consider ""POUND"" or ""MOUND"" but let's see.

I think ""LOINS"" is a valid and good choice.

But let me confirm: is ""LOINS"" a valid Scrabble word? Yes, it means the lower part of the abdomen.

To be safe, another common word: ""NOISY"" — N,O,I,S,Y — Y is available? Yes, and it's common enough.

But Y is a semivowel, and in word games, it can be useful.

Similarly, ""SHINY"" — S,H,I,N,Y — but H is less common.

Since we have all letters wrong in first guess, we want to cover new ground.

I think ""LOINS"" or ""NOISY"" — both are fine.

But ""LOINS"" has L instead of Y. L is more common than Y.

Letter frequency in English words: after removing C,R,A,T,E, the most common are:
O, I, N, S, L, D, U, M, P, H, etc.

So L is more common than Y.

But both guesses are acceptable.

Let's pick ""LOINS"".

So the next guess will be ""LOINS"".

But we must make sure the word is valid. I believe ""LOINS"" is acceptable.

To be safer, I can choose ""PILOT"" but T is excluded? First feedback: T(x) in CRATE, so T is not in the word, avoid.

""OILED"" has D and E? E is excluded.

So yes, ""LOINS"" is good.

Therefore, my guess is LOINS.

Returning in the format: <guess>LOINS</guess>After the feedback from the first guess ""CRATE"", where all letters (C, R, A, T, E) were marked as absent (x), it means none of these letters appear in the secret word. Therefore, the secret word must consist of letters from the remaining alphabet, excluding C, R, A, T, E.

To maximize information gain:
- The new guess should avoid using any of the excluded letters: C, R, A, T, E.
- It should include common letters that haven't been tried yet. After removing C, R, A, T, E, the most frequently occurring letters in English words are O, I, S, L, N, D, U, M, P, etc.
- To cover a broad range of possibilities, words with high-frequency letters and no repeats are preferred for early guesses.
- Possible words considered: 
  - ""LOINS"" (valid word; uses L, O, I, N, S—covering 5 high-frequency letters without duplicates).
  - ""SOLID"" (valid word; uses S, O, L, I, D—D has a moderate frequency).
  - ""SOUND"" (valid word; uses S, O, U, N, D—includes U, which is less common).
  - ""POUND"" (valid word; P, O, U, N, D—includes P and U, which are less frequent).
- ""LOINS"" was selected because it contains O, I, S, N, L—all appearing in the top 7 of the remaining letter frequencies—and has no repeated letters, offering efficient coverage of new possibilities.

This guess will provide feedback to narrow down the word pool significantly.

We have feedback from two guesses:
1. CRATE: all letters (C, R, A, T, E) are absent (x) from the secret word. So the secret word contains none of these.
2. LOINS: 
   - L is correct and in the correct position (✓) -> so the first letter of the secret word is L.
   - O is absent (x) -> not in the word at all.
   - I is present but in the wrong position (-) -> so I is in the word, but not the third letter.
   - N is absent (x) -> not in the word.
   - S is absent (x) -> not in the word.

From this, we know:
- The secret word starts with L.
- It contains the letter I, but not in the third position (since in LOINS, I was the third letter and it's wrong position, meaning it must be elsewhere).
- The letters O, N, S are not in the word. Also, from the first guess, C, R, A, T, E are not in the word.

So, total excluded letters: C, R, A, T, E, O, N, S.

We also know the word must have an I in one of the positions: 2, 4, or 5 (since position 1 is L and position 3 is not I).

Now, we need to make a new guess that:
- Starts with L (since first letter is fixed as L).
- Contains the letter I in one of the positions 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).
- Does not contain any of the excluded letters: C, R, A, T, E, O, N, S.

Available letters: from the alphabet, remove excluded: 
Excluded: A, C, E, O, R, T, N, S. 
So available: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: L is fixed at position 1, and I must appear once (since it's present, but we don't know if it appears more than once? The feedback doesn't specify, but typically we assume it appears at least once. Since it was marked present, at least one I is in the word).

We must form a 5-letter word that starts with L, has an I in position 2, 4, or 5, and uses only the available letters.

Let's think of words that start with L and have an I.

Possible positions for I:
- Position 2: e.g., L I _ _ _
- Position 4: e.g., L _ _ I _
- Position 5: e.g., L _ _ _ I

We also need to avoid O, N, S, and the others.

Let's try to list possible words:

Option 1: I in position 2: LI _ _ _
We need three more letters from available set: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (and I is already used, but it can be used again? The feedback doesn't say anything about multiple I's, so it's possible. But since we have limited tries, we might avoid duplicates to get more info).

But we know the word has at least one I, so if we put I in position 2, that might be the only I, or there might be more. However, to maximize information, we should try to use new letters.

Similarly for other positions.

Given the constraints, let's think of common words.

First, with I in position 2: LI _ _ _
Common words: LIGHT, LIMIT, LILAC, but LILAC has A (excluded) and C (excluded). LIMIT has T (excluded) and M and I again. LIGHT: G,H,T — T is excluded. So not good.

Other words: LIVID: L,I,V,I,D — but V and D are available, but has two I's? And we don't know if the word has two I's. But let's see: LIVID uses V,I,D. But we have I in position 2 and 4? The word is L-I-V-I-D. But we need to avoid excluded letters. V and D are available. However, we have two I's. But the feedback only said I is present, not how many. So it could be multiple.

But we also have to consider that in the previous guess, when we had I in position 3, it was marked present but wrong position. That doesn't tell us about multiplicity.

So LIVID: L, I, V, I, D — positions: 1:L (fixed), 2:I, 3:V, 4:I, 5:D.

But we don't know if the secret word has two I's. Also, we are using V and D which are new.

But let's see if there are better options.

Another word: LIPID — L,I,P,I,D — again two I's and P,D.

But P and D are available.

But we might want to avoid repeats to test more letters.

Option: I in position 4: L _ _ I _
We need to fill positions 2,3,5.

For example: words like ""ALIBI"" but A is excluded. ""VALID"" but V,A — A excluded.

With available letters: L _ _ I _

Possible: LUMBI? Not a word. LUCID? L,U,C,I,D — but C is excluded.

C is excluded from first guess.

Another: LUPIN? L,U,P,I,N — but N is excluded (from LOINS feedback, N is absent).

So not.

How about LUDIC? L,U,D,I,C — C excluded.

Not easy.

Option: I in position 5: L _ _ _ I
For example: ""LAPSI"" not a word. ""LURGI"" not a word. ""LARDI"" not a word.

Common words: ""LANAI"" but A and N excluded. ""LOTTI"" but O and T excluded.

Perhaps we need to consider words with I in position 2 or 4.

Another idea: what about ""LIKED""? L,I,K,E,D — but E is excluded.

""LIFED"" not a word.

""LIVED"" has E.

""LIGHT"" has T.

""LIMBO"": L,I,M,B,O — O is excluded.

""LIMBA"" — A excluded.

""LIMBY"" — is that a word? Not common.

Perhaps we should consider words with I in position 4.

For example: ""LYTIC"" but T and C excluded.

""LYCRA"" — C,R,A excluded.

Not working.

What about ""LUCRE"" but C,R,E excluded.

We need to use available letters.

Available: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

And we must have I in the word, not at position 3.

Since position 1 is L, and I must be at 2,4, or 5.

Let me try to list possible words:

- With I at 2: 
  - LID: but we need 5 letters. So words starting with LI.
  - LIBRA: but R and A excluded.
  - LIBBY: not common, and B repeated? L,I,B,B,Y — but B is available, Y available. But is it valid? LIBBY is a proper noun, might not be accepted. Avoid.
  - LIGER: L,I,G,E,R — E and R excluded.
  - LIKEN: L,I,K,E,N — E and N excluded.
  - LILAC: L,I,L,A,C — A and C excluded, and L repeated? But we have L at start, and again? The word is L-I-L-A-C, so position 3 is L. But we don't know if L is repeated? The feedback for LOINS had L correct at position 1, but that doesn't say anything about other positions. However, in LOINS, we had L at 1 and no other L, so if the secret word had another L, it might have been marked? But in LOINS, we had only one L, so if the secret word has two L's, the feedback would show one correct (position 1) and the other as present if in wrong position? But in this case, we don't have that.

Actually, in LOINS, we guessed L at position 1 and it was correct. If the secret word had another L, say at position 4, then when we guessed LOINS, position 4 was S (which was absent), so the second L would not have been guessed. So we don't know if there are multiple L's.

But to be safe, we might avoid assuming multiple L's for now.

Back to words: 
- LILTS: L,I,L,T,S — T and S excluded, and L repeated.
- LIMED: L,I,M,E,D — E excluded.
- LIMPS: L,I,M,P,S — S excluded.
- LINED: L,I,N,E,D — N and E excluded.
- LIPID: L,I,P,I,D — P and D available, but I repeated. Word is valid (a type of fat). So LIPID: positions 1:L, 2:I, 3:P, 4:I, 5:D.

This uses P and D, which are new.

But we have I at position 2 and 4. We know I is present, but we don't know if it's one or two. So it's acceptable.

Another word: LIVID: L,I,V,I,D — similar, with V and D.

V is less common than P? But both are possible.

But let's see other positions.

I in position 4: L _ _ I _
For example:
- MAULI? Not common.
- BAILI? Not word.
- HELIO? Not starting with L.

Words like: ""ALIBI"" not starting with L.

""LUCID"" but C excluded.

""LURID"": L,U,R,I,D — R excluded.

""LEVIN"" but E and N excluded.

Not many common words.

I in position 5: L _ _ _ I
For example:
- AALII: not starting with L.
- BANLI: not word.
- GENII: not starting with L.

Common words: ""YOGLI"" not word. ""YOGI"" is 4 letters.

""RABBI"" not starting with L.

""LAGNI"" not word.

""LOTHI"" — L,O,T,H,I — O and T excluded.

""LYMPI"" not word.

So it seems difficult to find words with I at the end.

Perhaps ""LITH"" is 4 letters.

Another idea: what about ""LIKUD""? Not common.

Given the difficulty, let's consider words with I at position 2 or 4.

We have ""LIPID"" and ""LIVID"" as candidates.

But let's see if there is a word with I at position 4.

For example: ""LUDIC"" but C excluded.

""LUMBI"" not word.

""LUVVI"" not word.

""LYTIC"" T and C excluded.

Perhaps ""LYMPH"" but no I, and H is available, but we must include I.

""LYMPH"" is L,Y,M,P,H — no I.

We must include I because we know it's in the word.

Another word: ""LABIA"" but A excluded.

Perhaps we should use a word that has I at position 4, like ""OBIIT"" not starting with L.

I think we have to go with I at position 2 or 5.

Position 5: ""TAXI"" is 4 letters. ""LURGI"" not word.

""LINGI"" not word.

""LONGI"" has O and N excluded.

Perhaps ""LAPPI"" not word.

Let's try ""LIPID"" or ""LIVID"".

But there is another word: ""LININ"" has N excluded.

""LIVID"" seems a valid choice: L,I,V,I,D.

But it has two I's. However, we can use it.

""LIPID"" also has two I's.

To avoid repeats, is there a word with only one I?

For example, with I at position 2: L I _ _ _

We need three letters from available, not I.

For instance: LIGHT has T excluded.

LIKED has E excluded.

LIMBO has O excluded.

LINK has N and K, but N excluded.

What about LIDAR? L,I,D,A,R — A and R excluded.

LIGER has E and R.

LIVER has E and R.

LIVID and LIPID are the only ones I can think of without excluded letters.

Another word: ""LIBEL"" has E and L repeated? L,I,B,E,L — E excluded and L repeated.

""LIBRA"" excluded.

""LICIT"" has C and T excluded.

""LIGAN"" has A and N.

""LIMBY"" — not standard.

""LIMEY"" has E and Y — E excluded.

""LINDY"" has N and D,Y — N excluded.

""LIPPY"" has P and Y, but Y is available, and no excluded? L,I,P,P,Y — but P repeated? The word is L-I-P-P-Y, so positions: 1:L, 2:I, 3:P, 4:P, 5:Y. But we have P repeated, which might not be ideal for information, but it's a valid word (meaning talkative).

But we have I at position 2, and P and Y.

Compared to LIPID, which has P and D.

LIPPY has P repeated, so we only get info on P once, and Y.

LIVID has V and D.

V is less common than P or D, so we might prefer to test V.

But let's see frequency: P is more common than V.

But we have to choose.

Another word: ""LIVED"" has E.

""LIVEN"" has E and N.

""LIVID"" seems the best so far.

But what about ""LIKUD""? Not common.

Or ""LIVOR"" has R and O excluded.

Perhaps ""LIPIN"" has N excluded.

I think we have to go with LIPID or LIVID.

But let's consider I at position 4.

For example, ""PUBLIC"" not starting with L and C excluded.

""MEDIA"" not starting with L.

What about ""VALID"" but V,A — A excluded.

""SOLID"" not starting with L and S excluded.

Another idea: ""FLUID"" but F,L,U,I,D — but we start with L, so not.

We need to start with L.

Perhaps ""LLOYD"" but L repeated, and O excluded.

I think it's hard.

What about ""LYCEE"" C and E excluded.

Perhaps we can try a word like ""LUMBI"" not word.

Or ""LUBRA"" has U,B,R,A — R and A excluded.

Not.

So let's go with ""LIVID"": L, I, V, I, D.

But we have I at position 2 and 4. We know I is in the word, but we don't know if it's one or two. By guessing two I's, if the secret word has only one I, then one of the I's will be marked as absent? But the feedback will tell us.

For example, if the secret word has only one I, then in LIVID, the I in position 2 might be correct or wrong, and the I in position 4 might be absent.

But it might be messy.

To avoid confusion, we can try to find a word with only one I.

For example, with I at position 2: L I _ _ _

With letters not excluded: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

So: L I B _ _ -> LIB? 5 letters: LIBER has E and R, excluded. LIBRA excluded. LIBBY? Not common.

L I D _ _ : LIDAR excluded.

L I F _ _ : LIFER has E and R. LIFTY not word.

L I G _ _ : LIGER excluded. LIGHT excluded.

L I H _ _ : not common, like LIHUE? Proper.

L I J _ _ : no.

L I K _ _ : LIKE? 4 letters. LIKED excluded. LIKEN excluded. LIKIN? Not common.

L I M _ _ : LIMBO excluded. LIMBY? LIMBA excluded. LIMBI? Not common.

L I P _ _ : LIPID, LIPPY, etc.

L I Q _ _ : LIQUE? Not 5 letters. LIQUI? Not.

L I T _ _ : LITAI? Not common. LITAS? S excluded.

L I V _ _ : LIVED excluded. LIVEN excluded. LIVID, which has two I's.

L I Z _ _ : LIZAR? Not. LIZZY? L,I,Z,Z,Y — Z and Y available. LIZZY is a word (informal for Elizabeth). So LIZZY: L,I,Z,Z,Y.

But Z is not very common, and Z repeated.

Not ideal.

With I at position 4: L _ _ I _

For example: L U B I _ : LUBIN? Not common. LUBRA excluded.

L U D I _ : LUDIC excluded.

L U K I _ : not word.

L U M I _ : LUMIN? N excluded.

L U P I _ : LUPIN excluded.

L U V I _ : not word.

L Y M I _ : not word.

L Y P I _ : not word.

With I at position 5: L _ _ _ I

L B D I? Not.

L D U I? Not.

Common: L A P S I? Excluded letters.

L E G I? E excluded.

L O G I? O excluded.

L U M P I: LUMPI? Not common. LUMPY is a word, but no I. LUMPI with I at end? Not.

L I P P I? Not.

I think we have to accept a word with two I's or with less common letters.

Another possibility: ""LIKIN"" - L,I,K,I,N but N excluded.

""LILIED"" is 6 letters.

Perhaps ""LIMPI"" not word.

Let's consider ""LIPID"" or ""LIVID"".

Or ""LIPPY"".

But ""LIPPY"" has P repeated, which is not good for information.

So between LIPID and LIVID, both have two I's, but LIPID has P and D, LIVID has V and D.

P is more common than V, so LIPID might be better to test P.

LIPID: L,I,P,I,D

Positions: 1:L (should be correct), 2:I (we don't know if correct or not), 3:P, 4:I, 5:D.

If the secret word has I at position 2, then position 2 will be correct. If not, it might be present or absent.

But it's acceptable.

Similarly, we can use ""LIMIT"" but T excluded.

I think we should go with ""LIPID"".

But let's see if there's a word with I at position 4 and no repeats.

For example, ""LEVIS"" but E and S excluded.

""LOVAT"" O and T excluded.

""LUCID"" C excluded.

""LURID"" R excluded.

""LYTIC"" T and C.

Not.

""LYCRA"" C,R,A.

No.

So I think ""LIPID"" is a reasonable guess.

Another word: ""LIVED"" but E excluded.

Or ""LIVER"" E and R.

No.

""LIFER"" E and R.

So I'll go with ""LIPID"".

But in ""LIPID"", we have I at position 2 and 4. If the secret word has only one I, then one of these will be marked as absent, which will tell us that there is only one I.

If both are present, then there are at least two I's.

So it's informative.

Similarly for position.

So let's choose ""LIPID"".

<guess>LIPID</guess>

But let's double-check the feedback: in LOINS, I was at position 3 and marked present but wrong position. So in the secret word, I is not at position 3, but it is at position 1,2,4, or 5? Position 1 is L, so not 1. So I is at 2,4, or 5.

In LIPID, we have I at 2 and 4, so we cover two possibilities.

If the secret word has I at position 2, then in LIPID, position 2 I will be correct, and position 4 I might be correct or not.

If I is at position 4, then position 4 I will be correct, and position 2 might be wrong.

If I is at position 5, then both position 2 and 4 I might be wrong, but one of them might be marked present if there is another I? But if the word has only one I, then only one of the I's in the guess can be present.

But it might be a bit confusing, but we can interpret the feedback.

To simplify, we could guess a word with I only at position 5.

For example, ""LURVI"" not word.

""LUVVI"" not word.

""LYTTA"" no I.

I think it's not possible to find a common word with I only at position 5.

So ""LIPID"" is fine.

Another word: ""LININ"" has N excluded.

""LITAI"" has T and A.

No.

So I'll go with LIPID.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRATE** → All letters (C, R, A, T, E) are absent (x). This means the secret word contains none of these letters.
- **Guess 2: LOINS** → 
  - L is correct and in the correct position (✓), so the first letter of the secret word is **L**.
  - O is absent (x), so O is not in the word.
  - I is present but in the wrong position (-), so I is in the word but not at position 3.
  - N and S are absent (x), so neither is in the word.

### Key Inferences:
- The secret word starts with **L**.
- The word contains the letter **I**, but not in position 3. Since position 1 is L, I must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
- Excluded letters (not in the word): **C, R, A, T, E, O, N, S**.
- Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. (L is fixed at position 1, and I must appear once, but may appear multiple times.)

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- The guess must start with **L** (position 1).
- It must include **I** in position 2, 4, or 5 to test its correct location.
- Avoid all excluded letters.
- Prioritize common letters to maximize information (e.g., D, P, V, M, U).
- Consider words with no repeated letters to test more new letters, but this is challenging given constraints.

After evaluating possible words (e.g., LIPID, LIVID, LIPPY), **LIPID** is chosen because:
- It starts with L (position 1).
- It includes I in positions 2 and 4 (testing two possible locations for I at once).
- It uses new letters P and D (high-frequency consonants) to gather more information.
- It avoids all excluded letters.
- If the secret word has only one I, the feedback will clarify which position is correct (or if I is duplicated).

<guess>LIPID</guess>",LIPID,"We have feedback from two guesses:
1. CRATE: all letters (C, R, A, T, E) are absent (x) from the secret word. So the secret word contains none of these.
2. LOINS: 
   - L is correct and in the correct position (✓) -> so the first letter of the secret word is L.
   - O is absent (x) -> not in the word at all.
   - I is present but in the wrong position (-) -> so I is in the word, but not the third letter.
   - N is absent (x) -> not in the word.
   - S is absent (x) -> not in the word.

From this, we know:
- The secret word starts with L.
- It contains the letter I, but not in the third position (since in LOINS, I was the third letter and it's wrong position, meaning it must be elsewhere).
- The letters O, N, S are not in the word. Also, from the first guess, C, R, A, T, E are not in the word.

So, total excluded letters: C, R, A, T, E, O, N, S.

We also know the word must have an I in one of the positions: 2, 4, or 5 (since position 1 is L and position 3 is not I).

Now, we need to make a new guess that:
- Starts with L (since first letter is fixed as L).
- Contains the letter I in one of the positions 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).
- Does not contain any of the excluded letters: C, R, A, T, E, O, N, S.

Available letters: from the alphabet, remove excluded: 
Excluded: A, C, E, O, R, T, N, S. 
So available: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: L is fixed at position 1, and I must appear once (since it's present, but we don't know if it appears more than once? The feedback doesn't specify, but typically we assume it appears at least once. Since it was marked present, at least one I is in the word).

We must form a 5-letter word that starts with L, has an I in position 2, 4, or 5, and uses only the available letters.

Let's think of words that start with L and have an I.

Possible positions for I:
- Position 2: e.g., L I _ _ _
- Position 4: e.g., L _ _ I _
- Position 5: e.g., L _ _ _ I

We also need to avoid O, N, S, and the others.

Let's try to list possible words:

Option 1: I in position 2: LI _ _ _
We need three more letters from available set: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (and I is already used, but it can be used again? The feedback doesn't say anything about multiple I's, so it's possible. But since we have limited tries, we might avoid duplicates to get more info).

But we know the word has at least one I, so if we put I in position 2, that might be the only I, or there might be more. However, to maximize information, we should try to use new letters.

Similarly for other positions.

Given the constraints, let's think of common words.

First, with I in position 2: LI _ _ _
Common words: LIGHT, LIMIT, LILAC, but LILAC has A (excluded) and C (excluded). LIMIT has T (excluded) and M and I again. LIGHT: G,H,T — T is excluded. So not good.

Other words: LIVID: L,I,V,I,D — but V and D are available, but has two I's? And we don't know if the word has two I's. But let's see: LIVID uses V,I,D. But we have I in position 2 and 4? The word is L-I-V-I-D. But we need to avoid excluded letters. V and D are available. However, we have two I's. But the feedback only said I is present, not how many. So it could be multiple.

But we also have to consider that in the previous guess, when we had I in position 3, it was marked present but wrong position. That doesn't tell us about multiplicity.

So LIVID: L, I, V, I, D — positions: 1:L (fixed), 2:I, 3:V, 4:I, 5:D.

But we don't know if the secret word has two I's. Also, we are using V and D which are new.

But let's see if there are better options.

Another word: LIPID — L,I,P,I,D — again two I's and P,D.

But P and D are available.

But we might want to avoid repeats to test more letters.

Option: I in position 4: L _ _ I _
We need to fill positions 2,3,5.

For example: words like ""ALIBI"" but A is excluded. ""VALID"" but V,A — A excluded.

With available letters: L _ _ I _

Possible: LUMBI? Not a word. LUCID? L,U,C,I,D — but C is excluded.

C is excluded from first guess.

Another: LUPIN? L,U,P,I,N — but N is excluded (from LOINS feedback, N is absent).

So not.

How about LUDIC? L,U,D,I,C — C excluded.

Not easy.

Option: I in position 5: L _ _ _ I
For example: ""LAPSI"" not a word. ""LURGI"" not a word. ""LARDI"" not a word.

Common words: ""LANAI"" but A and N excluded. ""LOTTI"" but O and T excluded.

Perhaps we need to consider words with I in position 2 or 4.

Another idea: what about ""LIKED""? L,I,K,E,D — but E is excluded.

""LIFED"" not a word.

""LIVED"" has E.

""LIGHT"" has T.

""LIMBO"": L,I,M,B,O — O is excluded.

""LIMBA"" — A excluded.

""LIMBY"" — is that a word? Not common.

Perhaps we should consider words with I in position 4.

For example: ""LYTIC"" but T and C excluded.

""LYCRA"" — C,R,A excluded.

Not working.

What about ""LUCRE"" but C,R,E excluded.

We need to use available letters.

Available: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

And we must have I in the word, not at position 3.

Since position 1 is L, and I must be at 2,4, or 5.

Let me try to list possible words:

- With I at 2: 
  - LID: but we need 5 letters. So words starting with LI.
  - LIBRA: but R and A excluded.
  - LIBBY: not common, and B repeated? L,I,B,B,Y — but B is available, Y available. But is it valid? LIBBY is a proper noun, might not be accepted. Avoid.
  - LIGER: L,I,G,E,R — E and R excluded.
  - LIKEN: L,I,K,E,N — E and N excluded.
  - LILAC: L,I,L,A,C — A and C excluded, and L repeated? But we have L at start, and again? The word is L-I-L-A-C, so position 3 is L. But we don't know if L is repeated? The feedback for LOINS had L correct at position 1, but that doesn't say anything about other positions. However, in LOINS, we had L at 1 and no other L, so if the secret word had another L, it might have been marked? But in LOINS, we had only one L, so if the secret word has two L's, the feedback would show one correct (position 1) and the other as present if in wrong position? But in this case, we don't have that.

Actually, in LOINS, we guessed L at position 1 and it was correct. If the secret word had another L, say at position 4, then when we guessed LOINS, position 4 was S (which was absent), so the second L would not have been guessed. So we don't know if there are multiple L's.

But to be safe, we might avoid assuming multiple L's for now.

Back to words: 
- LILTS: L,I,L,T,S — T and S excluded, and L repeated.
- LIMED: L,I,M,E,D — E excluded.
- LIMPS: L,I,M,P,S — S excluded.
- LINED: L,I,N,E,D — N and E excluded.
- LIPID: L,I,P,I,D — P and D available, but I repeated. Word is valid (a type of fat). So LIPID: positions 1:L, 2:I, 3:P, 4:I, 5:D.

This uses P and D, which are new.

But we have I at position 2 and 4. We know I is present, but we don't know if it's one or two. So it's acceptable.

Another word: LIVID: L,I,V,I,D — similar, with V and D.

V is less common than P? But both are possible.

But let's see other positions.

I in position 4: L _ _ I _
For example:
- MAULI? Not common.
- BAILI? Not word.
- HELIO? Not starting with L.

Words like: ""ALIBI"" not starting with L.

""LUCID"" but C excluded.

""LURID"": L,U,R,I,D — R excluded.

""LEVIN"" but E and N excluded.

Not many common words.

I in position 5: L _ _ _ I
For example:
- AALII: not starting with L.
- BANLI: not word.
- GENII: not starting with L.

Common words: ""YOGLI"" not word. ""YOGI"" is 4 letters.

""RABBI"" not starting with L.

""LAGNI"" not word.

""LOTHI"" — L,O,T,H,I — O and T excluded.

""LYMPI"" not word.

So it seems difficult to find words with I at the end.

Perhaps ""LITH"" is 4 letters.

Another idea: what about ""LIKUD""? Not common.

Given the difficulty, let's consider words with I at position 2 or 4.

We have ""LIPID"" and ""LIVID"" as candidates.

But let's see if there is a word with I at position 4.

For example: ""LUDIC"" but C excluded.

""LUMBI"" not word.

""LUVVI"" not word.

""LYTIC"" T and C excluded.

Perhaps ""LYMPH"" but no I, and H is available, but we must include I.

""LYMPH"" is L,Y,M,P,H — no I.

We must include I because we know it's in the word.

Another word: ""LABIA"" but A excluded.

Perhaps we should use a word that has I at position 4, like ""OBIIT"" not starting with L.

I think we have to go with I at position 2 or 5.

Position 5: ""TAXI"" is 4 letters. ""LURGI"" not word.

""LINGI"" not word.

""LONGI"" has O and N excluded.

Perhaps ""LAPPI"" not word.

Let's try ""LIPID"" or ""LIVID"".

But there is another word: ""LININ"" has N excluded.

""LIVID"" seems a valid choice: L,I,V,I,D.

But it has two I's. However, we can use it.

""LIPID"" also has two I's.

To avoid repeats, is there a word with only one I?

For example, with I at position 2: L I _ _ _

We need three letters from available, not I.

For instance: LIGHT has T excluded.

LIKED has E excluded.

LIMBO has O excluded.

LINK has N and K, but N excluded.

What about LIDAR? L,I,D,A,R — A and R excluded.

LIGER has E and R.

LIVER has E and R.

LIVID and LIPID are the only ones I can think of without excluded letters.

Another word: ""LIBEL"" has E and L repeated? L,I,B,E,L — E excluded and L repeated.

""LIBRA"" excluded.

""LICIT"" has C and T excluded.

""LIGAN"" has A and N.

""LIMBY"" — not standard.

""LIMEY"" has E and Y — E excluded.

""LINDY"" has N and D,Y — N excluded.

""LIPPY"" has P and Y, but Y is available, and no excluded? L,I,P,P,Y — but P repeated? The word is L-I-P-P-Y, so positions: 1:L, 2:I, 3:P, 4:P, 5:Y. But we have P repeated, which might not be ideal for information, but it's a valid word (meaning talkative).

But we have I at position 2, and P and Y.

Compared to LIPID, which has P and D.

LIPPY has P repeated, so we only get info on P once, and Y.

LIVID has V and D.

V is less common than P or D, so we might prefer to test V.

But let's see frequency: P is more common than V.

But we have to choose.

Another word: ""LIVED"" has E.

""LIVEN"" has E and N.

""LIVID"" seems the best so far.

But what about ""LIKUD""? Not common.

Or ""LIVOR"" has R and O excluded.

Perhaps ""LIPIN"" has N excluded.

I think we have to go with LIPID or LIVID.

But let's consider I at position 4.

For example, ""PUBLIC"" not starting with L and C excluded.

""MEDIA"" not starting with L.

What about ""VALID"" but V,A — A excluded.

""SOLID"" not starting with L and S excluded.

Another idea: ""FLUID"" but F,L,U,I,D — but we start with L, so not.

We need to start with L.

Perhaps ""LLOYD"" but L repeated, and O excluded.

I think it's hard.

What about ""LYCEE"" C and E excluded.

Perhaps we can try a word like ""LUMBI"" not word.

Or ""LUBRA"" has U,B,R,A — R and A excluded.

Not.

So let's go with ""LIVID"": L, I, V, I, D.

But we have I at position 2 and 4. We know I is in the word, but we don't know if it's one or two. By guessing two I's, if the secret word has only one I, then one of the I's will be marked as absent? But the feedback will tell us.

For example, if the secret word has only one I, then in LIVID, the I in position 2 might be correct or wrong, and the I in position 4 might be absent.

But it might be messy.

To avoid confusion, we can try to find a word with only one I.

For example, with I at position 2: L I _ _ _

With letters not excluded: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

So: L I B _ _ -> LIB? 5 letters: LIBER has E and R, excluded. LIBRA excluded. LIBBY? Not common.

L I D _ _ : LIDAR excluded.

L I F _ _ : LIFER has E and R. LIFTY not word.

L I G _ _ : LIGER excluded. LIGHT excluded.

L I H _ _ : not common, like LIHUE? Proper.

L I J _ _ : no.

L I K _ _ : LIKE? 4 letters. LIKED excluded. LIKEN excluded. LIKIN? Not common.

L I M _ _ : LIMBO excluded. LIMBY? LIMBA excluded. LIMBI? Not common.

L I P _ _ : LIPID, LIPPY, etc.

L I Q _ _ : LIQUE? Not 5 letters. LIQUI? Not.

L I T _ _ : LITAI? Not common. LITAS? S excluded.

L I V _ _ : LIVED excluded. LIVEN excluded. LIVID, which has two I's.

L I Z _ _ : LIZAR? Not. LIZZY? L,I,Z,Z,Y — Z and Y available. LIZZY is a word (informal for Elizabeth). So LIZZY: L,I,Z,Z,Y.

But Z is not very common, and Z repeated.

Not ideal.

With I at position 4: L _ _ I _

For example: L U B I _ : LUBIN? Not common. LUBRA excluded.

L U D I _ : LUDIC excluded.

L U K I _ : not word.

L U M I _ : LUMIN? N excluded.

L U P I _ : LUPIN excluded.

L U V I _ : not word.

L Y M I _ : not word.

L Y P I _ : not word.

With I at position 5: L _ _ _ I

L B D I? Not.

L D U I? Not.

Common: L A P S I? Excluded letters.

L E G I? E excluded.

L O G I? O excluded.

L U M P I: LUMPI? Not common. LUMPY is a word, but no I. LUMPI with I at end? Not.

L I P P I? Not.

I think we have to accept a word with two I's or with less common letters.

Another possibility: ""LIKIN"" - L,I,K,I,N but N excluded.

""LILIED"" is 6 letters.

Perhaps ""LIMPI"" not word.

Let's consider ""LIPID"" or ""LIVID"".

Or ""LIPPY"".

But ""LIPPY"" has P repeated, which is not good for information.

So between LIPID and LIVID, both have two I's, but LIPID has P and D, LIVID has V and D.

P is more common than V, so LIPID might be better to test P.

LIPID: L,I,P,I,D

Positions: 1:L (should be correct), 2:I (we don't know if correct or not), 3:P, 4:I, 5:D.

If the secret word has I at position 2, then position 2 will be correct. If not, it might be present or absent.

But it's acceptable.

Similarly, we can use ""LIMIT"" but T excluded.

I think we should go with ""LIPID"".

But let's see if there's a word with I at position 4 and no repeats.

For example, ""LEVIS"" but E and S excluded.

""LOVAT"" O and T excluded.

""LUCID"" C excluded.

""LURID"" R excluded.

""LYTIC"" T and C.

Not.

""LYCRA"" C,R,A.

No.

So I think ""LIPID"" is a reasonable guess.

Another word: ""LIVED"" but E excluded.

Or ""LIVER"" E and R.

No.

""LIFER"" E and R.

So I'll go with ""LIPID"".

But in ""LIPID"", we have I at position 2 and 4. If the secret word has only one I, then one of these will be marked as absent, which will tell us that there is only one I.

If both are present, then there are at least two I's.

So it's informative.

Similarly for position.

So let's choose ""LIPID"".

<guess>LIPID</guess>

But let's double-check the feedback: in LOINS, I was at position 3 and marked present but wrong position. So in the secret word, I is not at position 3, but it is at position 1,2,4, or 5? Position 1 is L, so not 1. So I is at 2,4, or 5.

In LIPID, we have I at 2 and 4, so we cover two possibilities.

If the secret word has I at position 2, then in LIPID, position 2 I will be correct, and position 4 I might be correct or not.

If I is at position 4, then position 4 I will be correct, and position 2 might be wrong.

If I is at position 5, then both position 2 and 4 I might be wrong, but one of them might be marked present if there is another I? But if the word has only one I, then only one of the I's in the guess can be present.

But it might be a bit confusing, but we can interpret the feedback.

To simplify, we could guess a word with I only at position 5.

For example, ""LURVI"" not word.

""LUVVI"" not word.

""LYTTA"" no I.

I think it's not possible to find a common word with I only at position 5.

So ""LIPID"" is fine.

Another word: ""LININ"" has N excluded.

""LITAI"" has T and A.

No.

So I'll go with LIPID.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRATE** → All letters (C, R, A, T, E) are absent (x). This means the secret word contains none of these letters.
- **Guess 2: LOINS** → 
  - L is correct and in the correct position (✓), so the first letter of the secret word is **L**.
  - O is absent (x), so O is not in the word.
  - I is present but in the wrong position (-), so I is in the word but not at position 3.
  - N and S are absent (x), so neither is in the word.

### Key Inferences:
- The secret word starts with **L**.
- The word contains the letter **I**, but not in position 3. Since position 1 is L, I must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
- Excluded letters (not in the word): **C, R, A, T, E, O, N, S**.
- Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. (L is fixed at position 1, and I must appear once, but may appear multiple times.)

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- The guess must start with **L** (position 1).
- It must include **I** in position 2, 4, or 5 to test its correct location.
- Avoid all excluded letters.
- Prioritize common letters to maximize information (e.g., D, P, V, M, U).
- Consider words with no repeated letters to test more new letters, but this is challenging given constraints.

After evaluating possible words (e.g., LIPID, LIVID, LIPPY), **LIPID** is chosen because:
- It starts with L (position 1).
- It includes I in positions 2 and 4 (testing two possible locations for I at once).
- It uses new letters P and D (high-frequency consonants) to gather more information.
- It avoids all excluded letters.
- If the secret word has only one I, the feedback will clarify which position is correct (or if I is duplicated).",Guess 3: LIPID -> FEEDBACK: L(✓) I(✓) P(✓) I(✓) D(✓),SUCCESS
