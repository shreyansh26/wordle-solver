We are making the first guess. Since there's no prior feedback, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain.
 A common starting word in such games is one with diverse letters and common vowels to test multiple letters at once.
 Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROATE"", or ""ADIEU"" are often used. Let's choose ""SLATE"" as it has common letters and vowels.

I need to make my first guess in the Wordle game. Since this is the first attempt, I have no prior feedback to go on. My goal is to choose a word that maximizes information gain—ideally covering common vowels and consonants to test their presence and positions.

A strong starting word typically includes:
- Multiple vowels (like A, E, I, O)
- Common consonants (like S, T, R)
- Avoids repeating letters to test more unique characters

One popular and effective starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (C, R, N). However, I could also consider words like ""SLATE"" or ""ROATE"". After evaluating, ""CRANE"" provides good coverage:
- It starts with a common consonant ""C"".
- Includes two vowels (A and E) in different positions.
- Uses high-frequency letters like R and N.

This choice will help me gather feedback on many frequent letters in English, allowing me to narrow down possibilities quickly for subsequent guesses.

We have feedback from the first guess: C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(-)
 This means:
 - R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, since ""CRANE"" is C R A N E -> positions 1 to 5).
 - E is in the word but not in the last position (since in ""CRANE"" E is at position 5, so the E must be in the word but in a different position).
 - C, A, and N are not in the word at all.

 Since R is correct at position 2, the secret word must have the form: _ R _ _ _

 We know E is present but not at the end (position 5). So E must be in one of the positions 1, 3, or 4? But wait: the word has only 5 positions.

 However, note that in ""CRANE"" E was guessed at position 5, but the feedback says it's present but not correct position. So E must be in the word somewhere else: positions 1, 3, or 4? But actually, the rules don't specify which position it is in, only that it is not in position 5 and that it exists elsewhere.

 But we must also remember: the word must be 5 letters, so E must be in one of the positions 1, 3, or 4? However, position 2 is taken by R. So E can be in position 1, 3, or 4.

 Also, we know that C, A, and N are not in the word.

 Now for the next guess, we want to test possible positions for E and also include other common letters to maximize information.

 We have to avoid using C, A, and N since they are not in the word.

 Since E is present but not at the end, let's think of words that have R in the second position and E somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.

 Example words: 
   Position 1: E R ... -> e.g., ERASE, ERECT, etc. but we cannot use A (and also E at start? we'll see)
   Position 3: _ R E _ _ -> e.g., TREND (but N is not allowed), BREDE (not common) ... 
   Position 4: _ R _ E _ -> e.g., TIRED (but T is unknown), etc.

 But note: we must also avoid C, A, N.

 Let's try to list common letters that we haven't tested yet: such as T, S, L, D, etc.

 Ideas:
 We know we must have E in the word (but not at position 5) and R at position 2.

 We also know that the word doesn't contain C, A, N.

 So, let's think of a word with:
   Position 2: R
   E in any of positions 1, 3, or 4.
   And using new letters like T, S, O, I, D, L, etc. to test more letters.

 Since we don't know where E is exactly, it might be beneficial to put E in a position we haven't tried before. In the first guess, E was at position 5 (which is wrong). So possible positions for E are 1, 3, or 4.

 However, note: we cannot put E at position 2 because that's R.

 One strategy is to try E in a new position and include more high-frequency consonants.

 Consider the word ""RETRY"": 
   R E T R Y -> but R is repeated? And we cannot repeat R unnecessarily? Also, the word must be 5 distinct letters? No, the rules don't prohibit repeats, but we don't know if the secret word has duplicates.

 However, our feedback for CRANE had R once and it was marked correct. So the secret word has at least one R. But it might have more? We don't know.

 But to avoid complexity, initially, let's assume no duplicates until we have evidence.

 So preferably, choose a word without repeated letters.

 Let's consider:

 - Position 1: E -> then word: E R ? ? ?
   Examples: ERGOT (but G and O are new), but we can't use A. So ERGOT? Or EROSE (but O and S)? 

 - Position 3: ? R E ? ? 
   Examples: BREDE (not common), TREND (has N which is out), FREET (not common), AREES (has A, not allowed). So how about ""PREEN""? But P and R and E: PREEN has double E? And E at position 4? PREEN: P R E E N -> but we cannot use N. And double E? Also not distinct.

 Alternatively, how about ""TREAD""? But it has A which is excluded.

 This is tricky.

 - Position 4: ? R ? E ? 
   Examples: TRICE (but C is excluded), BRIDE (has B and D? and I), BROKE (has B and O and K), etc.

 Since we also want to test other letters, let me try to pick a word that uses new consonants and includes E in a new position.

 Also note: we haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 But we must not use C, A, N.

 Let's choose a word that:
   Has R at position 2.
   Has E in a position that is not 5 (so we try position 3 or 4 or 1).
   Uses letters we haven't tried: e.g., T, O, S, L, etc.

 After brainstorming, one good candidate is ""TRIBE"":
   T R I B E -> 
   Position 1: T -> new
   Position 2: R -> correct (we know this must be R so it will be correct again?)
   Position 3: I -> new
   Position 4: B -> new
   Position 5: E -> we know E is present but not in position 5, but if we put E at position 5 again, we'll get a '-'? But wait: we know E is somewhere else, so if in the secret word E is not at position 5, we'll get 'x' for the E at position 5? But that would tell us E is not at 5 again? Actually, we already know it's not at 5 because first feedback E(-) meant the E at position 5 is wrong.

 However, note: the secret word might have two E's? But we don't know. So let me reexamine: the feedback for E was a '-' meaning that there is an E in the word but not at position 5. That does not preclude the word having another E at position 5? Actually, if the secret word had an E at position 5 and also an E elsewhere, then our guess E at position 5 would have been ✓? Because the rule: if the letter in the right position gets ✓, even if duplicates. So if the secret word had two E's and we guess one E at position 5 and that's the correct E at position 5, we'd get ✓. But if we guess E at position 5 and the E at position 5 is correct, even if there's another E, we get ✓ for that position.

 However, in our case we got E(-) meaning the E at position 5 is not correct? So the secret word does not have an E at position 5? But it does have E elsewhere? So E is definitely present and not at 5? And since the secret word has only one E? Or multiple? We don't know.

 Given that, it's safe to choose a word without E at position 5? But we can't put E at position 5 because the feedback already told us it's not there? So we must avoid E at position 5? Yes, because it's incorrect.

 Therefore, in the next guess, we should avoid putting E at position 5? Actually, we could put E at position 5? But we know it's not there, so it would be an incorrect position? Which we already know? So it wouldn't give new information? Better to put E in a new position.

 Therefore, TRIBE: E is at position 5? We should avoid that. So maybe move E to another position.

 Alternative word: ""BERET""? 
   B E R E T -> positions: 
   1: B
   2: E -> but we know position 2 is R? So we cannot change position 2? Because we already know R is fixed at position 2? So position 2 must be R? Because we got ✓ for R in position 2.

 Therefore, position 2 must be R. So any guess must have R at position 2.

 So in TRIBE if I want to avoid E at 5, I can modify it? But TRIBE has E at 5? So bad.

 How about ""TRIED"": 
   T R I E D -> 
   E is at position 4? And position 5 is D? So avoid E at 5.

 T R I E D:
   Position 1: T
   Position 2: R (correct, fixed)
   Position 3: I
   Position 4: E -> we want to test E in position 4? That's new because in first guess E was at 5? So testing position 4 is good? And D at 5.

 Another candidate: ""PRICE""? But C is excluded? So not allowed? Because we know C is not in the word.

 Another: ""FRIES""? 
   F R I E S -> E at 4, S at 5? And we can test F, I, S.

 Also: ""GRILL""? No E? But we must include E because we know the secret word has E? Otherwise we don't? Wait: we know E is present (from the '-' feedback).

 Therefore, if we don't include E in the guess, we risk missing information? Actually, we can use a word without E? Then we can test other letters? But the feedback will tell us about the letters we guess? But if we don't include E, then we don't get information about E's position? However, we already know E is in the word? But we don't know where? So to find E's position quickly, it's better to include E in the guess? And put it in a new position.

 Therefore, ""TRIED"" or ""FRIES"" or ""BRIDE""?

 But note: BRIDE has B and I and D? And E? And we haven't tested B? And also, we might be able to test multiple possibilities.

 However, we must not use C, A, N.

 Let's choose ""TRIED"": 
   T R I E D
   Positions: 
     1: T -> test T
     3: I -> test I
     4: E -> test E at 4? We know E is in the word and not at 5? So position 4 is a candidate? Also, position 1? And 3? So testing E in 4 might reveal something.
     5: D -> test D

 But note: the secret word has E? And we don't know if it has T, I, D? So it's safe.

 Another word: ""SHIRE""? H is not tested? But has E at the end? Wait, SHIRE: S H I R E -> position 4 is R? But we need R at position 2? And we have R at position 4? So if we put SHIRE:
   Position 1: S
   Position 2: H? But we must have R at position 2? So that's invalid? Because for position 2 we must put R? Because we know it's correct? So we need to guess a word with R at position 2? Meaning the second letter must be R? So all guesses must have R at the second letter? Otherwise, we will get an 'x' for that? But we already know it's R? And we don't want to change it? Actually, we can change it? But if we put something else at position 2, it would be wrong? Then we waste that slot? But we might gain information about other letters? However, it's better to keep R fixed because if we change it, then the feedback for position 2 will be 'x'? Which we already know it's R? So we avoid changing? So we keep R at position 2.

 Therefore, for ""TRIED"":
   Position 2: R -> must be R? So we know it will be ✓? Then we can use the guess to test the other positions? 

 Similarly for ""FRIES"": F R I E S -> same structure? F at 1, R at 2, I at 3, E at 4, S at 5.

 So between TRIED and FRIES:
   TRIED tests T, I, E (in position 4), D
   FRIES tests F, I, E (in position 4), S

 We need more common letters? T is more common than F? So TRIED might be better? Or S is even more common? But S is also tested in FRIES.

 Alternatively, how about ""PRIDE""? But P, R, I, D, E? And P, R, I, D? And R at position 2? And E at 5? Problem: E at 5? We avoid that? So no.

 How about ""TREES""? But has two E's? And E at position 4? And also E at 5? So position 4: E; position 5: S? But E at 5? We shouldn't put E at 5? So TREES has E at 5? So no.

 Another: ""TROVE""? T R O V E -> E at 5? Avoid.

 ""TRITE""? T R I T E? But E at 5? And repeated T? Avoid.

 ""TRICE"" -> C excluded.

 After some thought, a good word without E at 5 and with R at 2: ""SPREE"" but E at 5? Again in 5? No.

 ""SHREW"": S H R E W? Wait, SHREW: positions 1=S, 2=H (but we need R at 2) -> no? Because the second letter must be R? So the word must be in the form ? R ? ? ? 

 The word must have R as the second letter. So SHREW has H at position 2? That's not R? So it doesn't work? Because we know position 2 is R? So if we guess S H R E W, then position 2 is H? Then we would get an x for H? That's bad? Because we already know position 2 should be R? And we also are testing S, H, E, W? 

 But we want to maximize information? If we put position 2 as H, then we might get:
   Position 2: x (meaning H is not in word? Or we might get '-'? But currently, we don't know about H? So it's a waste? Because we know position 2 should be R? So if we put something else, we get an 'x'? Which tells us nothing about other positions? Because if we get an 'x', we don't know if that letter is present? Or not? Actually, the feedback for that letter will be:
   If we put H at position 2 and the secret word doesn't have H? Then it's 'x'. Or if it has H but not in position 2? Then it's '-'. 

 But we also have R to consider? Because we must have R? And we know R is at position 2? So if we put H at position 2, then we don't put R? And then R will go? Or where? Actually, the word SHREW does not have R? Because SHREW: S H R E W? So R is in position 3? Then position 3: R? Then we might get R at position 3? But since the secret word has R at position 2? That's important? So SHREW has R at position 3? And we know the secret word has R at position 2? So when we guess SHREW:

   Position 2: H -> if H is not in the word? Likely 'x'.
   Position 3: R -> which is in the word? But is it the same R? Or another? The secret word has at least one R at position 2? So if there's another R? Then it might be present? But we don't know if there are duplicates. So we might get R at position 3 marked as '-'? Because it is present but not at the correct position? Actually, the secret word has the R at position 2? Then the R in our guess at position 3 would be a duplicate? And marked '-'? Because the R at position 2 of the secret is already accounted for? And the R at position 3 isn't matched? So it might show '-'? But that's only if there is a second R? But we don't know? 

 This could confuse? Better to keep R fixed at position 2? Because we know that slot is correct? And we can focus on testing other letters? So I think the standard strategy is to keep the ✓ letters in the same position? Then move the '-' letters to new positions? And avoid using letters that are eliminated (C, A, N).

 So I'll choose a word that:
   Has R at position 2? Fixed.
   Has E somewhere? But not at 5? So positions: 1, 3, or 4? And we can avoid position 5? And also, we can avoid putting E at 5? Because we know it's not there? 

 Given that, I choose ""TRIED"": 
   T at position 1? Which might be new? 
   I at position 3? New? 
   E at position 4? To test if E is at position 4? 
   D at position 5? New.

 But wait: in the first guess, E was at position 5? We got '-' meaning E is in the word but not at 5? So E might be at 4? Then we put E at position 4? So we test that possibility? And if it's ✓? Then we know? If we get a '-'? Then E is either at 1 or 3? Then next time we try position 1 or 3? 

 So it's a good idea? 

 Also, include T and D? Common letters? And I? 

 Alternatively, ""SPREE"" -> S P R E E? But E at 5? Bad? So no? 

 Another option: ""BRUTE"": 
   B R U T E -> E at 5? Bad.

 ""DRIVE""? D R I V E -> E at 5? Bad.

 I think ""TRIED"" is a good guess? 

 But note: what if E is at position 3? Then we put E at position 4? We might not find out? 

 How about putting E at position 1? Then we have E at the beginning? 

 So words: ""ERUPT"": E R U P T -> 
   Positions:
     E at 1? 
     R at 2? (fixed)
     U at 3? 
     P at 4? 
     T at 5?

 That tests E at position 1? Which is a candidate? And U and P? Not common? 

 But let's count: 
   Previous feedback excluded C, A, N? 
   Now we're testing E at 1? And T? And U? and P? 

 Alternatively, ""STREP"": S T R E P -> 
   S at 1? 
   T at 2? But no? We must have R at 2? So position 2 is R? So ""ST"" would be: S at 1? And then R at 2? Then the rest? But STR..? like ""STREW"" or ""STRAW""? But cannot use A? Because A is excluded? STREW: S T R E W? 
   Positions: 1:S, 2:T? -> wait, no! That would have T at position 2? But we need R at position 2? So ""STREW"" has R at position 3? No? 
   Actually, S T R: S at pos1, T at pos2, R at pos3? So that doesn't fix position 2? 

 How about ""SERUM""? S E R U M: 
   Positions: 
     1: S
     2: E -> but fail? Because position 2 must be R? So it should be: 
        ""SERUM"": 
          1: S
          2: E? -> that's not R? So we cannot do that? 

 To have R at position 2? We must have the word: ? R ? ? ? 

 So for ""STREW"": 
   It is S at 1, T at 2, R at 3, E at 4, W at 5 -> which does not place R at 2? 

 We need a word like _ R _ _ _ ? 
   First letter: (S, T, E, etc.)
   Third: (E, I, etc.)
   Fourth: (E? Or not)
   Fifth: (consonant? D, S, T, etc.)

 Given the constraints, ""TRIED"" seems okay? Or ""BRINE""? But we cannot use N? Because N is excluded? 

 Another word: ""BRIDE"": 
   B R I D E -> 
   Positions:
     1: B
     2: R (fixed)
     3: I
     4: D
     5: E? -> E at 5? But we know E is not at 5? So placing E at 5 again would get 'x' or '-'? Actually, we already know it will be 'x' because the secret E is not at 5? Or if the secret has E at 5? But our earlier feedback showed E at 5 was incorrect? So it cannot be at 5? Therefore, we shouldn't waste E at position 5? 

 Therefore, avoid BRIDE? Also, because E at 5 is known to be wrong? 

 How about ""BRIDL""? Not a word? 

 Let me stick to ""TRIED"": 

   T R I E D

 This tests:
   T? at position 1: could be ✓, -, or x?
   I? at position 3: could be ...?
   E? at position 4: if it's ✓ then we know E is at 4? If '-' then it's present in another position? Or x? But wait, we know E is present? So cannot be x? Actually: feedback for E at position 4: 
      If the secret word has E at that position? ✓? 
      If not? Then '-' because E is in the word? So it would be '-'? Because E is present? But in the wrong position? Unless E is already correctly placed elsewhere? But we haven't identified any E? 

   D? at position 5: could appear? Could not?

 This is my best option? 

 Another word: ""GRILL""? But without E? But we must have E? So we might not test the letter E? And the secret word has E? Then we would not get the E at 5? But we already know? So putting a guess without E? Then we might get? 
   For example? If we guess GRILL? We'll get feedback for each letter? And for E? We know E is present? So we don't need to include E in every guess? No? Because the feedback will tell us which letters we guessed are present? And we'll eventually include E? But to narrow down E's position? It's faster to include it? 

 Since we have 6 guesses? And first one done? Using TRIED? 

 Final decision: ""TRIED"" is a valid word? It's in the dictionary? And it fits? 

 So I'll go with TRIED.

 Therefore, next guess: TRIED
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, A, N are not in the word (marked 'x').
- R is correct and in position 2 (marked '✓').
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (marked '-').

The secret word has R in position 2 and E somewhere else (positions 1, 3, or 4). For the second guess:
- Keep R fixed in position 2.
- Test E in position 4 to check if it's correct there.
- Introduce new common letters: T (position 1), I (position 3), and D (position 5) to maximize information.

<thinking>
The word ""TRIED"" meets all criteria:
1. Second letter is R (fixed ✓ position).
2. E is placed in position 4 to test its correct placement.
3. Avoids eliminated letters C, A, N.
4. Tests new letters T, I, D at unexamined positions.
</thinking>

<guess>TRIED</guess>",TRIED,"We have feedback from the first guess: C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(-)
 This means:
 - R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, since ""CRANE"" is C R A N E -> positions 1 to 5).
 - E is in the word but not in the last position (since in ""CRANE"" E is at position 5, so the E must be in the word but in a different position).
 - C, A, and N are not in the word at all.

 Since R is correct at position 2, the secret word must have the form: _ R _ _ _

 We know E is present but not at the end (position 5). So E must be in one of the positions 1, 3, or 4? But wait: the word has only 5 positions.

 However, note that in ""CRANE"" E was guessed at position 5, but the feedback says it's present but not correct position. So E must be in the word somewhere else: positions 1, 3, or 4? But actually, the rules don't specify which position it is in, only that it is not in position 5 and that it exists elsewhere.

 But we must also remember: the word must be 5 letters, so E must be in one of the positions 1, 3, or 4? However, position 2 is taken by R. So E can be in position 1, 3, or 4.

 Also, we know that C, A, and N are not in the word.

 Now for the next guess, we want to test possible positions for E and also include other common letters to maximize information.

 We have to avoid using C, A, and N since they are not in the word.

 Since E is present but not at the end, let's think of words that have R in the second position and E somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.

 Example words: 
   Position 1: E R ... -> e.g., ERASE, ERECT, etc. but we cannot use A (and also E at start? we'll see)
   Position 3: _ R E _ _ -> e.g., TREND (but N is not allowed), BREDE (not common) ... 
   Position 4: _ R _ E _ -> e.g., TIRED (but T is unknown), etc.

 But note: we must also avoid C, A, N.

 Let's try to list common letters that we haven't tested yet: such as T, S, L, D, etc.

 Ideas:
 We know we must have E in the word (but not at position 5) and R at position 2.

 We also know that the word doesn't contain C, A, N.

 So, let's think of a word with:
   Position 2: R
   E in any of positions 1, 3, or 4.
   And using new letters like T, S, O, I, D, L, etc. to test more letters.

 Since we don't know where E is exactly, it might be beneficial to put E in a position we haven't tried before. In the first guess, E was at position 5 (which is wrong). So possible positions for E are 1, 3, or 4.

 However, note: we cannot put E at position 2 because that's R.

 One strategy is to try E in a new position and include more high-frequency consonants.

 Consider the word ""RETRY"": 
   R E T R Y -> but R is repeated? And we cannot repeat R unnecessarily? Also, the word must be 5 distinct letters? No, the rules don't prohibit repeats, but we don't know if the secret word has duplicates.

 However, our feedback for CRANE had R once and it was marked correct. So the secret word has at least one R. But it might have more? We don't know.

 But to avoid complexity, initially, let's assume no duplicates until we have evidence.

 So preferably, choose a word without repeated letters.

 Let's consider:

 - Position 1: E -> then word: E R ? ? ?
   Examples: ERGOT (but G and O are new), but we can't use A. So ERGOT? Or EROSE (but O and S)? 

 - Position 3: ? R E ? ? 
   Examples: BREDE (not common), TREND (has N which is out), FREET (not common), AREES (has A, not allowed). So how about ""PREEN""? But P and R and E: PREEN has double E? And E at position 4? PREEN: P R E E N -> but we cannot use N. And double E? Also not distinct.

 Alternatively, how about ""TREAD""? But it has A which is excluded.

 This is tricky.

 - Position 4: ? R ? E ? 
   Examples: TRICE (but C is excluded), BRIDE (has B and D? and I), BROKE (has B and O and K), etc.

 Since we also want to test other letters, let me try to pick a word that uses new consonants and includes E in a new position.

 Also note: we haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 But we must not use C, A, N.

 Let's choose a word that:
   Has R at position 2.
   Has E in a position that is not 5 (so we try position 3 or 4 or 1).
   Uses letters we haven't tried: e.g., T, O, S, L, etc.

 After brainstorming, one good candidate is ""TRIBE"":
   T R I B E -> 
   Position 1: T -> new
   Position 2: R -> correct (we know this must be R so it will be correct again?)
   Position 3: I -> new
   Position 4: B -> new
   Position 5: E -> we know E is present but not in position 5, but if we put E at position 5 again, we'll get a '-'? But wait: we know E is somewhere else, so if in the secret word E is not at position 5, we'll get 'x' for the E at position 5? But that would tell us E is not at 5 again? Actually, we already know it's not at 5 because first feedback E(-) meant the E at position 5 is wrong.

 However, note: the secret word might have two E's? But we don't know. So let me reexamine: the feedback for E was a '-' meaning that there is an E in the word but not at position 5. That does not preclude the word having another E at position 5? Actually, if the secret word had an E at position 5 and also an E elsewhere, then our guess E at position 5 would have been ✓? Because the rule: if the letter in the right position gets ✓, even if duplicates. So if the secret word had two E's and we guess one E at position 5 and that's the correct E at position 5, we'd get ✓. But if we guess E at position 5 and the E at position 5 is correct, even if there's another E, we get ✓ for that position.

 However, in our case we got E(-) meaning the E at position 5 is not correct? So the secret word does not have an E at position 5? But it does have E elsewhere? So E is definitely present and not at 5? And since the secret word has only one E? Or multiple? We don't know.

 Given that, it's safe to choose a word without E at position 5? But we can't put E at position 5 because the feedback already told us it's not there? So we must avoid E at position 5? Yes, because it's incorrect.

 Therefore, in the next guess, we should avoid putting E at position 5? Actually, we could put E at position 5? But we know it's not there, so it would be an incorrect position? Which we already know? So it wouldn't give new information? Better to put E in a new position.

 Therefore, TRIBE: E is at position 5? We should avoid that. So maybe move E to another position.

 Alternative word: ""BERET""? 
   B E R E T -> positions: 
   1: B
   2: E -> but we know position 2 is R? So we cannot change position 2? Because we already know R is fixed at position 2? So position 2 must be R? Because we got ✓ for R in position 2.

 Therefore, position 2 must be R. So any guess must have R at position 2.

 So in TRIBE if I want to avoid E at 5, I can modify it? But TRIBE has E at 5? So bad.

 How about ""TRIED"": 
   T R I E D -> 
   E is at position 4? And position 5 is D? So avoid E at 5.

 T R I E D:
   Position 1: T
   Position 2: R (correct, fixed)
   Position 3: I
   Position 4: E -> we want to test E in position 4? That's new because in first guess E was at 5? So testing position 4 is good? And D at 5.

 Another candidate: ""PRICE""? But C is excluded? So not allowed? Because we know C is not in the word.

 Another: ""FRIES""? 
   F R I E S -> E at 4, S at 5? And we can test F, I, S.

 Also: ""GRILL""? No E? But we must include E because we know the secret word has E? Otherwise we don't? Wait: we know E is present (from the '-' feedback).

 Therefore, if we don't include E in the guess, we risk missing information? Actually, we can use a word without E? Then we can test other letters? But the feedback will tell us about the letters we guess? But if we don't include E, then we don't get information about E's position? However, we already know E is in the word? But we don't know where? So to find E's position quickly, it's better to include E in the guess? And put it in a new position.

 Therefore, ""TRIED"" or ""FRIES"" or ""BRIDE""?

 But note: BRIDE has B and I and D? And E? And we haven't tested B? And also, we might be able to test multiple possibilities.

 However, we must not use C, A, N.

 Let's choose ""TRIED"": 
   T R I E D
   Positions: 
     1: T -> test T
     3: I -> test I
     4: E -> test E at 4? We know E is in the word and not at 5? So position 4 is a candidate? Also, position 1? And 3? So testing E in 4 might reveal something.
     5: D -> test D

 But note: the secret word has E? And we don't know if it has T, I, D? So it's safe.

 Another word: ""SHIRE""? H is not tested? But has E at the end? Wait, SHIRE: S H I R E -> position 4 is R? But we need R at position 2? And we have R at position 4? So if we put SHIRE:
   Position 1: S
   Position 2: H? But we must have R at position 2? So that's invalid? Because for position 2 we must put R? Because we know it's correct? So we need to guess a word with R at position 2? Meaning the second letter must be R? So all guesses must have R at the second letter? Otherwise, we will get an 'x' for that? But we already know it's R? And we don't want to change it? Actually, we can change it? But if we put something else at position 2, it would be wrong? Then we waste that slot? But we might gain information about other letters? However, it's better to keep R fixed because if we change it, then the feedback for position 2 will be 'x'? Which we already know it's R? So we avoid changing? So we keep R at position 2.

 Therefore, for ""TRIED"":
   Position 2: R -> must be R? So we know it will be ✓? Then we can use the guess to test the other positions? 

 Similarly for ""FRIES"": F R I E S -> same structure? F at 1, R at 2, I at 3, E at 4, S at 5.

 So between TRIED and FRIES:
   TRIED tests T, I, E (in position 4), D
   FRIES tests F, I, E (in position 4), S

 We need more common letters? T is more common than F? So TRIED might be better? Or S is even more common? But S is also tested in FRIES.

 Alternatively, how about ""PRIDE""? But P, R, I, D, E? And P, R, I, D? And R at position 2? And E at 5? Problem: E at 5? We avoid that? So no.

 How about ""TREES""? But has two E's? And E at position 4? And also E at 5? So position 4: E; position 5: S? But E at 5? We shouldn't put E at 5? So TREES has E at 5? So no.

 Another: ""TROVE""? T R O V E -> E at 5? Avoid.

 ""TRITE""? T R I T E? But E at 5? And repeated T? Avoid.

 ""TRICE"" -> C excluded.

 After some thought, a good word without E at 5 and with R at 2: ""SPREE"" but E at 5? Again in 5? No.

 ""SHREW"": S H R E W? Wait, SHREW: positions 1=S, 2=H (but we need R at 2) -> no? Because the second letter must be R? So the word must be in the form ? R ? ? ? 

 The word must have R as the second letter. So SHREW has H at position 2? That's not R? So it doesn't work? Because we know position 2 is R? So if we guess S H R E W, then position 2 is H? Then we would get an x for H? That's bad? Because we already know position 2 should be R? And we also are testing S, H, E, W? 

 But we want to maximize information? If we put position 2 as H, then we might get:
   Position 2: x (meaning H is not in word? Or we might get '-'? But currently, we don't know about H? So it's a waste? Because we know position 2 should be R? So if we put something else, we get an 'x'? Which tells us nothing about other positions? Because if we get an 'x', we don't know if that letter is present? Or not? Actually, the feedback for that letter will be:
   If we put H at position 2 and the secret word doesn't have H? Then it's 'x'. Or if it has H but not in position 2? Then it's '-'. 

 But we also have R to consider? Because we must have R? And we know R is at position 2? So if we put H at position 2, then we don't put R? And then R will go? Or where? Actually, the word SHREW does not have R? Because SHREW: S H R E W? So R is in position 3? Then position 3: R? Then we might get R at position 3? But since the secret word has R at position 2? That's important? So SHREW has R at position 3? And we know the secret word has R at position 2? So when we guess SHREW:

   Position 2: H -> if H is not in the word? Likely 'x'.
   Position 3: R -> which is in the word? But is it the same R? Or another? The secret word has at least one R at position 2? So if there's another R? Then it might be present? But we don't know if there are duplicates. So we might get R at position 3 marked as '-'? Because it is present but not at the correct position? Actually, the secret word has the R at position 2? Then the R in our guess at position 3 would be a duplicate? And marked '-'? Because the R at position 2 of the secret is already accounted for? And the R at position 3 isn't matched? So it might show '-'? But that's only if there is a second R? But we don't know? 

 This could confuse? Better to keep R fixed at position 2? Because we know that slot is correct? And we can focus on testing other letters? So I think the standard strategy is to keep the ✓ letters in the same position? Then move the '-' letters to new positions? And avoid using letters that are eliminated (C, A, N).

 So I'll choose a word that:
   Has R at position 2? Fixed.
   Has E somewhere? But not at 5? So positions: 1, 3, or 4? And we can avoid position 5? And also, we can avoid putting E at 5? Because we know it's not there? 

 Given that, I choose ""TRIED"": 
   T at position 1? Which might be new? 
   I at position 3? New? 
   E at position 4? To test if E is at position 4? 
   D at position 5? New.

 But wait: in the first guess, E was at position 5? We got '-' meaning E is in the word but not at 5? So E might be at 4? Then we put E at position 4? So we test that possibility? And if it's ✓? Then we know? If we get a '-'? Then E is either at 1 or 3? Then next time we try position 1 or 3? 

 So it's a good idea? 

 Also, include T and D? Common letters? And I? 

 Alternatively, ""SPREE"" -> S P R E E? But E at 5? Bad? So no? 

 Another option: ""BRUTE"": 
   B R U T E -> E at 5? Bad.

 ""DRIVE""? D R I V E -> E at 5? Bad.

 I think ""TRIED"" is a good guess? 

 But note: what if E is at position 3? Then we put E at position 4? We might not find out? 

 How about putting E at position 1? Then we have E at the beginning? 

 So words: ""ERUPT"": E R U P T -> 
   Positions:
     E at 1? 
     R at 2? (fixed)
     U at 3? 
     P at 4? 
     T at 5?

 That tests E at position 1? Which is a candidate? And U and P? Not common? 

 But let's count: 
   Previous feedback excluded C, A, N? 
   Now we're testing E at 1? And T? And U? and P? 

 Alternatively, ""STREP"": S T R E P -> 
   S at 1? 
   T at 2? But no? We must have R at 2? So position 2 is R? So ""ST"" would be: S at 1? And then R at 2? Then the rest? But STR..? like ""STREW"" or ""STRAW""? But cannot use A? Because A is excluded? STREW: S T R E W? 
   Positions: 1:S, 2:T? -> wait, no! That would have T at position 2? But we need R at position 2? So ""STREW"" has R at position 3? No? 
   Actually, S T R: S at pos1, T at pos2, R at pos3? So that doesn't fix position 2? 

 How about ""SERUM""? S E R U M: 
   Positions: 
     1: S
     2: E -> but fail? Because position 2 must be R? So it should be: 
        ""SERUM"": 
          1: S
          2: E? -> that's not R? So we cannot do that? 

 To have R at position 2? We must have the word: ? R ? ? ? 

 So for ""STREW"": 
   It is S at 1, T at 2, R at 3, E at 4, W at 5 -> which does not place R at 2? 

 We need a word like _ R _ _ _ ? 
   First letter: (S, T, E, etc.)
   Third: (E, I, etc.)
   Fourth: (E? Or not)
   Fifth: (consonant? D, S, T, etc.)

 Given the constraints, ""TRIED"" seems okay? Or ""BRINE""? But we cannot use N? Because N is excluded? 

 Another word: ""BRIDE"": 
   B R I D E -> 
   Positions:
     1: B
     2: R (fixed)
     3: I
     4: D
     5: E? -> E at 5? But we know E is not at 5? So placing E at 5 again would get 'x' or '-'? Actually, we already know it will be 'x' because the secret E is not at 5? Or if the secret has E at 5? But our earlier feedback showed E at 5 was incorrect? So it cannot be at 5? Therefore, we shouldn't waste E at position 5? 

 Therefore, avoid BRIDE? Also, because E at 5 is known to be wrong? 

 How about ""BRIDL""? Not a word? 

 Let me stick to ""TRIED"": 

   T R I E D

 This tests:
   T? at position 1: could be ✓, -, or x?
   I? at position 3: could be ...?
   E? at position 4: if it's ✓ then we know E is at 4? If '-' then it's present in another position? Or x? But wait, we know E is present? So cannot be x? Actually: feedback for E at position 4: 
      If the secret word has E at that position? ✓? 
      If not? Then '-' because E is in the word? So it would be '-'? Because E is present? But in the wrong position? Unless E is already correctly placed elsewhere? But we haven't identified any E? 

   D? at position 5: could appear? Could not?

 This is my best option? 

 Another word: ""GRILL""? But without E? But we must have E? So we might not test the letter E? And the secret word has E? Then we would not get the E at 5? But we already know? So putting a guess without E? Then we might get? 
   For example? If we guess GRILL? We'll get feedback for each letter? And for E? We know E is present? So we don't need to include E in every guess? No? Because the feedback will tell us which letters we guessed are present? And we'll eventually include E? But to narrow down E's position? It's faster to include it? 

 Since we have 6 guesses? And first one done? Using TRIED? 

 Final decision: ""TRIED"" is a valid word? It's in the dictionary? And it fits? 

 So I'll go with TRIED.

 Therefore, next guess: TRIEDBased on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, A, N are not in the word (marked 'x').
- R is correct and in position 2 (marked '✓').
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (marked '-').

The secret word has R in position 2 and E somewhere else (positions 1, 3, or 4). For the second guess:
- Keep R fixed in position 2.
- Test E in position 4 to check if it's correct there.
- Introduce new common letters: T (position 1), I (position 3), and D (position 5) to maximize information.

<thinking>
The word ""TRIED"" meets all criteria:
1. Second letter is R (fixed ✓ position).
2. E is placed in position 4 to test its correct placement.
3. Avoids eliminated letters C, A, N.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since there's no prior feedback, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain.
 A common starting word in such games is one with diverse letters and common vowels to test multiple letters at once.
 Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROATE"", or ""ADIEU"" are often used. Let's choose ""SLATE"" as it has common letters and vowels.<thinking>
I need to make my first guess in the Wordle game. Since this is the first attempt, I have no prior feedback to go on. My goal is to choose a word that maximizes information gain—ideally covering common vowels and consonants to test their presence and positions.

A strong starting word typically includes:
- Multiple vowels (like A, E, I, O)
- Common consonants (like S, T, R)
- Avoids repeating letters to test more unique characters

One popular and effective starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (C, R, N). However, I could also consider words like ""SLATE"" or ""ROATE"". After evaluating, ""CRANE"" provides good coverage:
- It starts with a common consonant ""C"".
- Includes two vowels (A and E) in different positions.
- Uses high-frequency letters like R and N.

This choice will help me gather feedback on many frequent letters in English, allowing me to narrow down possibilities quickly for subsequent guesses.
</thinking>

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess: C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(-)
 This means:
 - R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, since ""CRANE"" is C R A N E -> positions 1 to 5).
 - E is in the word but not in the last position (since in ""CRANE"" E is at position 5, so the E must be in the word but in a different position).
 - C, A, and N are not in the word at all.

 Since R is correct at position 2, the secret word must have the form: _ R _ _ _

 We know E is present but not at the end (position 5). So E must be in one of the positions 1, 3, or 4? But wait: the word has only 5 positions.

 However, note that in ""CRANE"" E was guessed at position 5, but the feedback says it's present but not correct position. So E must be in the word somewhere else: positions 1, 3, or 4? But actually, the rules don't specify which position it is in, only that it is not in position 5 and that it exists elsewhere.

 But we must also remember: the word must be 5 letters, so E must be in one of the positions 1, 3, or 4? However, position 2 is taken by R. So E can be in position 1, 3, or 4.

 Also, we know that C, A, and N are not in the word.

 Now for the next guess, we want to test possible positions for E and also include other common letters to maximize information.

 We have to avoid using C, A, and N since they are not in the word.

 Since E is present but not at the end, let's think of words that have R in the second position and E somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.

 Example words: 
   Position 1: E R ... -> e.g., ERASE, ERECT, etc. but we cannot use A (and also E at start? we'll see)
   Position 3: _ R E _ _ -> e.g., TREND (but N is not allowed), BREDE (not common) ... 
   Position 4: _ R _ E _ -> e.g., TIRED (but T is unknown), etc.

 But note: we must also avoid C, A, N.

 Let's try to list common letters that we haven't tested yet: such as T, S, L, D, etc.

 Ideas:
 We know we must have E in the word (but not at position 5) and R at position 2.

 We also know that the word doesn't contain C, A, N.

 So, let's think of a word with:
   Position 2: R
   E in any of positions 1, 3, or 4.
   And using new letters like T, S, O, I, D, L, etc. to test more letters.

 Since we don't know where E is exactly, it might be beneficial to put E in a position we haven't tried before. In the first guess, E was at position 5 (which is wrong). So possible positions for E are 1, 3, or 4.

 However, note: we cannot put E at position 2 because that's R.

 One strategy is to try E in a new position and include more high-frequency consonants.

 Consider the word ""RETRY"": 
   R E T R Y -> but R is repeated? And we cannot repeat R unnecessarily? Also, the word must be 5 distinct letters? No, the rules don't prohibit repeats, but we don't know if the secret word has duplicates.

 However, our feedback for CRANE had R once and it was marked correct. So the secret word has at least one R. But it might have more? We don't know.

 But to avoid complexity, initially, let's assume no duplicates until we have evidence.

 So preferably, choose a word without repeated letters.

 Let's consider:

 - Position 1: E -> then word: E R ? ? ?
   Examples: ERGOT (but G and O are new), but we can't use A. So ERGOT? Or EROSE (but O and S)? 

 - Position 3: ? R E ? ? 
   Examples: BREDE (not common), TREND (has N which is out), FREET (not common), AREES (has A, not allowed). So how about ""PREEN""? But P and R and E: PREEN has double E? And E at position 4? PREEN: P R E E N -> but we cannot use N. And double E? Also not distinct.

 Alternatively, how about ""TREAD""? But it has A which is excluded.

 This is tricky.

 - Position 4: ? R ? E ? 
   Examples: TRICE (but C is excluded), BRIDE (has B and D? and I), BROKE (has B and O and K), etc.

 Since we also want to test other letters, let me try to pick a word that uses new consonants and includes E in a new position.

 Also note: we haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 But we must not use C, A, N.

 Let's choose a word that:
   Has R at position 2.
   Has E in a position that is not 5 (so we try position 3 or 4 or 1).
   Uses letters we haven't tried: e.g., T, O, S, L, etc.

 After brainstorming, one good candidate is ""TRIBE"":
   T R I B E -> 
   Position 1: T -> new
   Position 2: R -> correct (we know this must be R so it will be correct again?)
   Position 3: I -> new
   Position 4: B -> new
   Position 5: E -> we know E is present but not in position 5, but if we put E at position 5 again, we'll get a '-'? But wait: we know E is somewhere else, so if in the secret word E is not at position 5, we'll get 'x' for the E at position 5? But that would tell us E is not at 5 again? Actually, we already know it's not at 5 because first feedback E(-) meant the E at position 5 is wrong.

 However, note: the secret word might have two E's? But we don't know. So let me reexamine: the feedback for E was a '-' meaning that there is an E in the word but not at position 5. That does not preclude the word having another E at position 5? Actually, if the secret word had an E at position 5 and also an E elsewhere, then our guess E at position 5 would have been ✓? Because the rule: if the letter in the right position gets ✓, even if duplicates. So if the secret word had two E's and we guess one E at position 5 and that's the correct E at position 5, we'd get ✓. But if we guess E at position 5 and the E at position 5 is correct, even if there's another E, we get ✓ for that position.

 However, in our case we got E(-) meaning the E at position 5 is not correct? So the secret word does not have an E at position 5? But it does have E elsewhere? So E is definitely present and not at 5? And since the secret word has only one E? Or multiple? We don't know.

 Given that, it's safe to choose a word without E at position 5? But we can't put E at position 5 because the feedback already told us it's not there? So we must avoid E at position 5? Yes, because it's incorrect.

 Therefore, in the next guess, we should avoid putting E at position 5? Actually, we could put E at position 5? But we know it's not there, so it would be an incorrect position? Which we already know? So it wouldn't give new information? Better to put E in a new position.

 Therefore, TRIBE: E is at position 5? We should avoid that. So maybe move E to another position.

 Alternative word: ""BERET""? 
   B E R E T -> positions: 
   1: B
   2: E -> but we know position 2 is R? So we cannot change position 2? Because we already know R is fixed at position 2? So position 2 must be R? Because we got ✓ for R in position 2.

 Therefore, position 2 must be R. So any guess must have R at position 2.

 So in TRIBE if I want to avoid E at 5, I can modify it? But TRIBE has E at 5? So bad.

 How about ""TRIED"": 
   T R I E D -> 
   E is at position 4? And position 5 is D? So avoid E at 5.

 T R I E D:
   Position 1: T
   Position 2: R (correct, fixed)
   Position 3: I
   Position 4: E -> we want to test E in position 4? That's new because in first guess E was at 5? So testing position 4 is good? And D at 5.

 Another candidate: ""PRICE""? But C is excluded? So not allowed? Because we know C is not in the word.

 Another: ""FRIES""? 
   F R I E S -> E at 4, S at 5? And we can test F, I, S.

 Also: ""GRILL""? No E? But we must include E because we know the secret word has E? Otherwise we don't? Wait: we know E is present (from the '-' feedback).

 Therefore, if we don't include E in the guess, we risk missing information? Actually, we can use a word without E? Then we can test other letters? But the feedback will tell us about the letters we guess? But if we don't include E, then we don't get information about E's position? However, we already know E is in the word? But we don't know where? So to find E's position quickly, it's better to include E in the guess? And put it in a new position.

 Therefore, ""TRIED"" or ""FRIES"" or ""BRIDE""?

 But note: BRIDE has B and I and D? And E? And we haven't tested B? And also, we might be able to test multiple possibilities.

 However, we must not use C, A, N.

 Let's choose ""TRIED"": 
   T R I E D
   Positions: 
     1: T -> test T
     3: I -> test I
     4: E -> test E at 4? We know E is in the word and not at 5? So position 4 is a candidate? Also, position 1? And 3? So testing E in 4 might reveal something.
     5: D -> test D

 But note: the secret word has E? And we don't know if it has T, I, D? So it's safe.

 Another word: ""SHIRE""? H is not tested? But has E at the end? Wait, SHIRE: S H I R E -> position 4 is R? But we need R at position 2? And we have R at position 4? So if we put SHIRE:
   Position 1: S
   Position 2: H? But we must have R at position 2? So that's invalid? Because for position 2 we must put R? Because we know it's correct? So we need to guess a word with R at position 2? Meaning the second letter must be R? So all guesses must have R at the second letter? Otherwise, we will get an 'x' for that? But we already know it's R? And we don't want to change it? Actually, we can change it? But if we put something else at position 2, it would be wrong? Then we waste that slot? But we might gain information about other letters? However, it's better to keep R fixed because if we change it, then the feedback for position 2 will be 'x'? Which we already know it's R? So we avoid changing? So we keep R at position 2.

 Therefore, for ""TRIED"":
   Position 2: R -> must be R? So we know it will be ✓? Then we can use the guess to test the other positions? 

 Similarly for ""FRIES"": F R I E S -> same structure? F at 1, R at 2, I at 3, E at 4, S at 5.

 So between TRIED and FRIES:
   TRIED tests T, I, E (in position 4), D
   FRIES tests F, I, E (in position 4), S

 We need more common letters? T is more common than F? So TRIED might be better? Or S is even more common? But S is also tested in FRIES.

 Alternatively, how about ""PRIDE""? But P, R, I, D, E? And P, R, I, D? And R at position 2? And E at 5? Problem: E at 5? We avoid that? So no.

 How about ""TREES""? But has two E's? And E at position 4? And also E at 5? So position 4: E; position 5: S? But E at 5? We shouldn't put E at 5? So TREES has E at 5? So no.

 Another: ""TROVE""? T R O V E -> E at 5? Avoid.

 ""TRITE""? T R I T E? But E at 5? And repeated T? Avoid.

 ""TRICE"" -> C excluded.

 After some thought, a good word without E at 5 and with R at 2: ""SPREE"" but E at 5? Again in 5? No.

 ""SHREW"": S H R E W? Wait, SHREW: positions 1=S, 2=H (but we need R at 2) -> no? Because the second letter must be R? So the word must be in the form ? R ? ? ? 

 The word must have R as the second letter. So SHREW has H at position 2? That's not R? So it doesn't work? Because we know position 2 is R? So if we guess S H R E W, then position 2 is H? Then we would get an x for H? That's bad? Because we already know position 2 should be R? And we also are testing S, H, E, W? 

 But we want to maximize information? If we put position 2 as H, then we might get:
   Position 2: x (meaning H is not in word? Or we might get '-'? But currently, we don't know about H? So it's a waste? Because we know position 2 should be R? So if we put something else, we get an 'x'? Which tells us nothing about other positions? Because if we get an 'x', we don't know if that letter is present? Or not? Actually, the feedback for that letter will be:
   If we put H at position 2 and the secret word doesn't have H? Then it's 'x'. Or if it has H but not in position 2? Then it's '-'. 

 But we also have R to consider? Because we must have R? And we know R is at position 2? So if we put H at position 2, then we don't put R? And then R will go? Or where? Actually, the word SHREW does not have R? Because SHREW: S H R E W? So R is in position 3? Then position 3: R? Then we might get R at position 3? But since the secret word has R at position 2? That's important? So SHREW has R at position 3? And we know the secret word has R at position 2? So when we guess SHREW:

   Position 2: H -> if H is not in the word? Likely 'x'.
   Position 3: R -> which is in the word? But is it the same R? Or another? The secret word has at least one R at position 2? So if there's another R? Then it might be present? But we don't know if there are duplicates. So we might get R at position 3 marked as '-'? Because it is present but not at the correct position? Actually, the secret word has the R at position 2? Then the R in our guess at position 3 would be a duplicate? And marked '-'? Because the R at position 2 of the secret is already accounted for? And the R at position 3 isn't matched? So it might show '-'? But that's only if there is a second R? But we don't know? 

 This could confuse? Better to keep R fixed at position 2? Because we know that slot is correct? And we can focus on testing other letters? So I think the standard strategy is to keep the ✓ letters in the same position? Then move the '-' letters to new positions? And avoid using letters that are eliminated (C, A, N).

 So I'll choose a word that:
   Has R at position 2? Fixed.
   Has E somewhere? But not at 5? So positions: 1, 3, or 4? And we can avoid position 5? And also, we can avoid putting E at 5? Because we know it's not there? 

 Given that, I choose ""TRIED"": 
   T at position 1? Which might be new? 
   I at position 3? New? 
   E at position 4? To test if E is at position 4? 
   D at position 5? New.

 But wait: in the first guess, E was at position 5? We got '-' meaning E is in the word but not at 5? So E might be at 4? Then we put E at position 4? So we test that possibility? And if it's ✓? Then we know? If we get a '-'? Then E is either at 1 or 3? Then next time we try position 1 or 3? 

 So it's a good idea? 

 Also, include T and D? Common letters? And I? 

 Alternatively, ""SPREE"" -> S P R E E? But E at 5? Bad? So no? 

 Another option: ""BRUTE"": 
   B R U T E -> E at 5? Bad.

 ""DRIVE""? D R I V E -> E at 5? Bad.

 I think ""TRIED"" is a good guess? 

 But note: what if E is at position 3? Then we put E at position 4? We might not find out? 

 How about putting E at position 1? Then we have E at the beginning? 

 So words: ""ERUPT"": E R U P T -> 
   Positions:
     E at 1? 
     R at 2? (fixed)
     U at 3? 
     P at 4? 
     T at 5?

 That tests E at position 1? Which is a candidate? And U and P? Not common? 

 But let's count: 
   Previous feedback excluded C, A, N? 
   Now we're testing E at 1? And T? And U? and P? 

 Alternatively, ""STREP"": S T R E P -> 
   S at 1? 
   T at 2? But no? We must have R at 2? So position 2 is R? So ""ST"" would be: S at 1? And then R at 2? Then the rest? But STR..? like ""STREW"" or ""STRAW""? But cannot use A? Because A is excluded? STREW: S T R E W? 
   Positions: 1:S, 2:T? -> wait, no! That would have T at position 2? But we need R at position 2? So ""STREW"" has R at position 3? No? 
   Actually, S T R: S at pos1, T at pos2, R at pos3? So that doesn't fix position 2? 

 How about ""SERUM""? S E R U M: 
   Positions: 
     1: S
     2: E -> but fail? Because position 2 must be R? So it should be: 
        ""SERUM"": 
          1: S
          2: E? -> that's not R? So we cannot do that? 

 To have R at position 2? We must have the word: ? R ? ? ? 

 So for ""STREW"": 
   It is S at 1, T at 2, R at 3, E at 4, W at 5 -> which does not place R at 2? 

 We need a word like _ R _ _ _ ? 
   First letter: (S, T, E, etc.)
   Third: (E, I, etc.)
   Fourth: (E? Or not)
   Fifth: (consonant? D, S, T, etc.)

 Given the constraints, ""TRIED"" seems okay? Or ""BRINE""? But we cannot use N? Because N is excluded? 

 Another word: ""BRIDE"": 
   B R I D E -> 
   Positions:
     1: B
     2: R (fixed)
     3: I
     4: D
     5: E? -> E at 5? But we know E is not at 5? So placing E at 5 again would get 'x' or '-'? Actually, we already know it will be 'x' because the secret E is not at 5? Or if the secret has E at 5? But our earlier feedback showed E at 5 was incorrect? So it cannot be at 5? Therefore, we shouldn't waste E at position 5? 

 Therefore, avoid BRIDE? Also, because E at 5 is known to be wrong? 

 How about ""BRIDL""? Not a word? 

 Let me stick to ""TRIED"": 

   T R I E D

 This tests:
   T? at position 1: could be ✓, -, or x?
   I? at position 3: could be ...?
   E? at position 4: if it's ✓ then we know E is at 4? If '-' then it's present in another position? Or x? But wait, we know E is present? So cannot be x? Actually: feedback for E at position 4: 
      If the secret word has E at that position? ✓? 
      If not? Then '-' because E is in the word? So it would be '-'? Because E is present? But in the wrong position? Unless E is already correctly placed elsewhere? But we haven't identified any E? 

   D? at position 5: could appear? Could not?

 This is my best option? 

 Another word: ""GRILL""? But without E? But we must have E? So we might not test the letter E? And the secret word has E? Then we would not get the E at 5? But we already know? So putting a guess without E? Then we might get? 
   For example? If we guess GRILL? We'll get feedback for each letter? And for E? We know E is present? So we don't need to include E in every guess? No? Because the feedback will tell us which letters we guessed are present? And we'll eventually include E? But to narrow down E's position? It's faster to include it? 

 Since we have 6 guesses? And first one done? Using TRIED? 

 Final decision: ""TRIED"" is a valid word? It's in the dictionary? And it fits? 

 So I'll go with TRIED.

 Therefore, next guess: TRIEDBased on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, A, N are not in the word (marked 'x').
- R is correct and in position 2 (marked '✓').
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (marked '-').

The secret word has R in position 2 and E somewhere else (positions 1, 3, or 4). For the second guess:
- Keep R fixed in position 2.
- Test E in position 4 to check if it's correct there.
- Introduce new common letters: T (position 1), I (position 3), and D (position 5) to maximize information.

<thinking>
The word ""TRIED"" meets all criteria:
1. Second letter is R (fixed ✓ position).
2. E is placed in position 4 to test its correct placement.
3. Avoids eliminated letters C, A, N.
4. Tests new letters T, I, D at unexamined positions.

E ? \n   Examples: TRICE (but C is excluded), BRIDE (has B and D? and I), BROKE (has B and O and K), etc.\n\n Since we also want to test other letters, let me try to pick a word that uses new consonants and includes E in a new position.\n\n Also note: we haven\'t tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n But we must not use C, A, N.\n\n Let\'s choose a word that:\n   Has R at position 2.\n   Has E in a position that is not 5 (so we try position 3 or 4 or 1).\n   Uses letters we haven\'t tried: e.g., T, O, S, L, etc.\n\n After brainstorming, one good candidate is ""TRIBE"":\n   T R I B E -> \n   Position 1: T -> new\n   Position 2: R -> correct (we know this must be R so it will be correct again?)\n   Position 3: I -> new\n   Position 4: B -> new\n   Position 5: E -> we know E is present but not in position 5, but if we put E at position 5 again, we\'ll get a \'-\'? But wait: we know E is somewhere else, so if in the secret word E is not at position 5, we\'ll get \'x\' for the E at position 5? But that would tell us E is not at 5 again? Actually, we already know it\'s not at 5 because first feedback E(-) meant the E at position 5 is wrong.\n\n However, note: the secret word might have two E\'s? But we don\'t know. So let me reexamine: the feedback for E was a \'-\' meaning that there is an E in the word but not at position 5. That does not preclude the word having another E at position 5? Actually, if the secret word had an E at position 5 and also an E elsewhere, then our guess E at position 5 would have been ✓? Because the rule: if the letter in the right position gets ✓, even if duplicates. So if the secret word had two E\'s and we guess one E at position 5 and that\'s the correct E at position 5, we\'d get ✓. But if we guess E at position 5 and the E at position 5 is correct, even if there\'s another E, we get ✓ for that position.\n\n However, in our case we got E(-) meaning the E at position 5 is not correct? So the secret word does not have an E at position 5? But it does have E elsewhere? So E is definitely present and not at 5? And since the secret word has only one E? Or multiple? We don\'t know.\n\n Given that, it\'s safe to choose a word without E at position 5? But we can\'t put E at position 5 because the feedback already told us it\'s not there? So we must avoid E at position 5? Yes, because it\'s incorrect.\n\n Therefore, in the next guess, we should avoid putting E at position 5? Actually, we could put E at position 5? But we know it\'s not there, so it would be an incorrect position? Which we already know? So it wouldn\'t give new information? Better to put E in a new position.\n\n Therefore, TRIBE: E is at position 5? We should avoid that. So maybe move E to another position.\n\n Alternative word: ""BERET""? \n   B E R E T -> positions: \n   1: B\n   2: E -> but we know position 2 is R? So we cannot change position 2? Because we already know R is fixed at position 2? So position 2 must be R? Because we got ✓ for R in position 2.\n\n Therefore, position 2 must be R. So any guess must have R at position 2.\n\n So in TRIBE if I want to avoid E at 5, I can modify it? But TRIBE has E at 5? So bad.\n\n How about ""TRIED"": \n   T R I E D -> \n   E is at position 4? And position 5 is D? So avoid E at 5.\n\n T R I E D:\n   Position 1: T\n   Position 2: R (correct, fixed)\n   Position 3: I\n   Position 4: E -> we want to test E in position 4? That\'s new because in first guess E was at 5? So testing position 4 is good? And D at 5.\n\n Another candidate: ""PRICE""? But C is excluded? So not allowed? Because we know C is not in the word.\n\n Another: ""FRIES""? \n   F R I E S -> E at 4, S at 5? And we can test F, I, S.\n\n Also: ""GRILL""? No E? But we must include E because we know the secret word has E? Otherwise we don\'t? Wait: we know E is present (from the \'-\' feedback).\n\n Therefore, if we don\'t include E in the guess, we risk missing information? Actually, we can use a word without E? Then we can test other letters? But the feedback will tell us about the letters we guess? But if we don\'t include E, then we don\'t get information about E\'s position? However, we already know E is in the word? But we don\'t know where? So to find E\'s position quickly, it\'s better to include E in the guess? And put it in a new position.\n\n Therefore, ""TRIED"" or ""FRIES"" or ""BRIDE""?\n\n But note: BRIDE has B and I and D? And E? And we haven\'t tested B? And also, we might be able to test multiple possibilities.\n\n However, we must not use C, A, N.\n\n Let\'s choose ""TRIED"": \n   T R I E D\n   Positions: \n     1: T -> test T\n     3: I -> test I\n     4: E -> test E at 4? We know E is in the word and not at 5? So position 4 is a candidate? Also, position 1? And 3? So testing E in 4 might reveal something.\n     5: D -> test D\n\n But note: the secret word has E? And we don\'t know if it has T, I, D? So it\'s safe.\n\n Another word: ""SHIRE""? H is not tested? But has E at the end? Wait, SHIRE: S H I R E -> position 4 is R? But we need R at position 2? And we have R at position 4? So if we put SHIRE:\n   Position 1: S\n   Position 2: H? But we must have R at position 2? So that\'s invalid? Because for position 2 we must put R? Because we know it\'s correct? So we need to guess a word with R at position 2? Meaning the second letter must be R? So all guesses must have R at the second letter? Otherwise, we will get an \'x\' for that? But we already know it\'s R? And we don\'t want to change it? Actually, we can change it? But if we put something else at position 2, it would be wrong? Then we waste that slot? But we might gain information about other letters? However, it\'s better to keep R fixed because if we change it, then the feedback for position 2 will be \'x\'? Which we already know it\'s R? So we avoid changing? So we keep R at position 2.\n\n Therefore, for ""TRIED"":\n   Position 2: R -> must be R? So we know it will be ✓? Then we can use the guess to test the other positions? \n\n Similarly for ""FRIES"": F R I E S -> same structure? F at 1, R at 2, I at 3, E at 4, S at 5.\n\n So between TRIED and FRIES:\n   TRIED tests T, I, E (in position 4), D\n   FRIES tests F, I, E (in position 4), S\n\n We need more common letters? T is more common than F? So TRIED might be better? Or S is even more common? But S is also tested in FRIES.\n\n Alternatively, how about ""PRIDE""? But P, R, I, D, E? And P, R, I, D? And R at position 2? And E at 5? Problem: E at 5? We avoid that? So no.\n\n How about ""TREES""? But has two E\'s? And E at position 4? And also E at 5? So position 4: E; position 5: S? But E at 5? We shouldn\'t put E at 5? So TREES has E at 5? So no.\n\n Another: ""TROVE""? T R O V E -> E at 5? Avoid.\n\n ""TRITE""? T R I T E? But E at 5? And repeated T? Avoid.\n\n ""TRICE"" -> C excluded.\n\n After some thought, a good word without E at 5 and with R at 2: ""SPREE"" but E at 5? Again in 5? No.\n\n ""SHREW"": S H R E W? Wait, SHREW: positions 1=S, 2=H (but we need R at 2) -> no? Because the second letter must be R? So the word must be in the form ? R ? ? ? \n\n The word must have R as the second letter. So SHREW has H at position 2? That\'s not R? So it doesn\'t work? Because we know position 2 is R? So if we guess S H R E W, then position 2 is H? Then we would get an x for H? That\'s bad? Because we already know position 2 should be R? And we also are testing S, H, E, W? \n\n But we want to maximize information? If we put position 2 as H, then we might get:\n   Position 2: x (meaning H is not in word? Or we might get \'-\'? But currently, we don\'t know about H? So it\'s a waste? Because we know position 2 should be R? So if we put something else, we get an \'x\'? Which tells us nothing about other positions? Because if we get an \'x\', we don\'t know if that letter is present? Or not? Actually, the feedback for that letter will be:\n   If we put H at position 2 and the secret word doesn\'t have H? Then it\'s \'x\'. Or if it has H but not in position 2? Then it\'s \'-\'. \n\n But we also have R to consider? Because we must have R? And we know R is at position 2? So if we put H at position 2, then we don\'t put R? And then R will go? Or where? Actually, the word SHREW does not have R? Because SHREW: S H R E W? So R is in position 3? Then position 3: R? Then we might get R at position 3? But since the secret word has R at position 2? That\'s important? So SHREW has R at position 3? And we know the secret word has R at position 2? So when we guess SHREW:\n\n   Position 2: H -> if H is not in the word? Likely \'x\'.\n   Position 3: R -> which is in the word? But is it the same R? Or another? The secret word has at least one R at position 2? So if there\'s another R? Then it might be present? But we don\'t know if there are duplicates. So we might get R at position 3 marked as \'-\'? Because it is present but not at the correct position? Actually, the secret word has the R at position 2? Then the R in our guess at position 3 would be a duplicate? And marked \'-\'? Because the R at position 2 of the secret is already accounted for? And the R at position 3 isn\'t matched? So it might show \'-\'? But that\'s only if there is a second R? But we don\'t know? \n\n This could confuse? Better to keep R fixed at position 2? Because we know that slot is correct? And we can focus on testing other letters? So I think the standard strategy is to keep the ✓ letters in the same position? Then move the \'-\' letters to new positions? And avoid using letters that are eliminated (C, A, N).\n\n So I\'ll choose a word that:\n   Has R at position 2? Fixed.\n   Has E somewhere? But not at 5? So positions: 1, 3, or 4? And we can avoid position 5? And also, we can avoid putting E at 5? Because we know it\'s not there? \n\n Given that, I choose ""TRIED"": \n   T at position 1? Which might be new? \n   I at position 3? New? \n   E at position 4? To test if E is at position 4? \n   D at position 5? New.\n\n But wait: in the first guess, E was at position 5? We got \'-\' meaning E is in the word but not at 5? So E might be at 4? Then we put E at position 4? So we test that possibility? And if it\'s ✓? Then we know? If we get a \'-\'? Then E is either at 1 or 3? Then next time we try position 1 or 3? \n\n So it\'s a good idea? \n\n Also, include T and D? Common letters? And I? \n\n Alternatively, ""SPREE"" -> S P R E E? But E at 5? Bad? So no? \n\n Another option: ""BRUTE"": \n   B R U T E -> E at 5? Bad.\n\n ""DRIVE""? D R I V E -> E at 5? Bad.\n\n I think ""TRIED"" is a good guess? \n\n But note: what if E is at position 3? Then we put E at position 4? We might not find out? \n\n How about putting E at position 1? Then we have E at the beginning? \n\n So words: ""ERUPT"": E R U P T -> \n   Positions:\n     E at 1? \n     R at 2? (fixed)\n     U at 3? \n     P at 4? \n     T at 5?\n\n That tests E at position 1? Which is a candidate? And U and P? Not common? \n\n But let\'s count: \n   Previous feedback excluded C, A, N? \n   Now we\'re testing E at 1? And T? And U? and P? \n\n Alternatively, ""STREP"": S T R E P -> \n   S at 1? \n   T at 2? But no? We must have R at 2? So position 2 is R? So ""ST"" would be: S at 1? And then R at 2? Then the rest? But STR..? like ""STREW"" or ""STRAW""? But cannot use A? Because A is excluded? STREW: S T R E W? \n   Positions: 1:S, 2:T? -> wait, no! That would have T at position 2? But we need R at position 2? So ""STREW"" has R at position 3? No? \n   Actually, S T R: S at pos1, T at pos2, R at pos3? So that doesn\'t fix position 2? \n\n How about ""SERUM""? S E R U M: \n   Positions: \n     1: S\n     2: E -> but fail? Because position 2 must be R? So it should be: \n        ""SERUM"": \n          1: S\n          2: E? -> that\'s not R? So we cannot do that? \n\n To have R at position 2? We must have the word: ? R ? ? ? \n\n So for ""STREW"": \n   It is S at 1, T at 2, R at 3, E at 4, W at 5 -> which does not place R at 2? \n\n We need a word like _ R _ _ _ ? \n   First letter: (S, T, E, etc.)\n   Third: (E, I, etc.)\n   Fourth: (E? Or not)\n   Fifth: (consonant? D, S, T, etc.)\n\n Given the constraints, ""TRIED"" seems okay? Or ""BRINE""? But we cannot use N? Because N is excluded? \n\n Another word: ""BRIDE"": \n   B R I D E -> \n   Positions:\n     1: B\n     2: R (fixed)\n     3: I\n     4: D\n     5: E? -> E at 5? But we know E is not at 5? So placing E at 5 again would get \'x\' or \'-\'? Actually, we already know it will be \'x\' because the secret E is not at 5? Or if the secret has E at 5? But our earlier feedback showed E at 5 was incorrect? So it cannot be at 5? Therefore, we shouldn\'t waste E at position 5? \n\n Therefore, avoid BRIDE? Also, because E at 5 is known to be wrong? \n\n How about ""BRIDL""? Not a word? \n\n Let me stick to ""TRIED"": \n\n   T R I E D\n\n This tests:\n   T? at position 1: could be ✓, -, or x?\n   I? at position 3: could be ...?\n   E? at position 4: if it\'s ✓ then we know E is at 4? If \'-\' then it\'s present in another position? Or x? But wait, we know E is present? So cannot be x? Actually: feedback for E at position 4: \n      If the secret word has E at that position? ✓? \n      If not? Then \'-\' because E is in the word? So it would be \'-\'? Because E is present? But in the wrong position? Unless E is already correctly placed elsewhere? But we haven\'t identified any E? \n\n   D? at position 5: could appear? Could not?\n\n This is my best option? \n\n Another word: ""GRILL""? But without E? But we must have E? So we might not test the letter E? And the secret word has E? Then we would not get the E at 5? But we already know? So putting a guess without E? Then we might get? \n   For example? If we guess GRILL? We\'ll get feedback for each letter? And for E? We know E is present? So we don\'t need to include E in every guess? No? Because the feedback will tell us which letters we guessed are present? And we\'ll eventually include E? But to narrow down E\'s position? It\'s faster to include it? \n\n Since we have 6 guesses? And first one done? Using TRIED? \n\n Final decision: ""TRIED"" is a valid word? It\'s in the dictionary? And it fits? \n\n So I\'ll go with TRIED.\n\n Therefore, next guess: TRIEDBased on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- C, A, N are not in the word (marked \'x\').\n- R is correct and in position 2 (marked \'✓\').\n- E is in the word but not in position 5 (marked \'-\').\n\nThe secret word has R in position 2 and E somewhere else (positions 1, 3, or 4). For the second guess:\n- Keep R fixed in position 2.\n- Test E in position 4 to check if it\'s correct there.\n- Introduce new common letters: T (position 1), I (position 3), and D (position 5) to maximize information.\n\n<thinking>\nThe word ""TRIED"" meets all criteria:\n1. Second letter is R (fixed ✓ position).\n2. E is placed in position 4 to test its correct placement.\n3. Avoids eliminated letters C, A, N.\n4. Tests new letters T, I, D at unexamined positions.\n</thinking>\n\n<guess>TRIED</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: TRIED -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) I(x) E(✓) D(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have new feedback from Guess 2: TRIED -> T(x), R(✓), I(x), E(✓), D(✓)

Interpretation:
- T is not in the word (x)
- R is correct and remains in position 2 (✓) — we already knew this
- I is not in the word (x)
- E is correct in position 4 (✓) — this is new information
- D is correct in position 5 (✓) — also new

Therefore, we now know:
- Secret word has R in position 2, E in position 4, D in position 5 → format: _ R _ E D
- Excluded letters: C, A, N, T, I (from both guesses)
- Known present letter from before: E (now placed)
- No other known present letters left? Wait, E was already known and now firmly placed.

So the secret word pattern is: _ R _ E D

We need to fill the first and third positions.

Excluded letters: C, A, N, T, I (so avoid these)
Known letters: R, E, D are fixed in positions 2,4,5.

Remaining possibilities: The first and third positions can be any letter except the excluded ones. We should consider common letters that haven't been tested yet.

Remaining untested letters (from English alphabet): B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

For maximum information gain, we want to test common letters in positions 1 and 3.

Common consonants to test: S, L, B, G, P, etc.

We also have to consider that the entire word must be a valid English word matching _ R _ E D

Possible words: 
Examples: 
- BRUED? Not a word.
- GRUED? Not common.
- BROAD? But O and A: A is excluded? And A is already excluded? Also positions: B R O A D? But we need E in position 4? D in 5? BROAD has O in 3 and A in 4? Conflict.

Actual English words fitting _ R _ E D pattern:
- BREED? But has E in position 3? BREED: B R E E D → pattern _ R _ E D: position 3 is E? Not _ R _ E D? BREED is B R E E D → pos1=B, pos2=R, pos3=E, pos4=E, pos5=D? But in our pattern, position 3 is unknown and position 4 is E? So BREED has E in pos3 and E in pos4? But we have E fixed in pos4? So pos3 can be anything except E? Actually, the pattern is: 
   pos1: ?, 
   pos2: R (fixed), 
   pos3: ? (needs a letter, could be E? but the secret pattern has pos4 E? So if pos3 is E? Then we have E at pos3 and E at pos4? Duplicate E? Possible? But the word must be valid? Also, BREED does have E at pos3? So how does it match? Pattern: _ R _ E D: BREED: pos3 is E? So we write: B R E E D → so in our pattern, we have: pos1:B, pos2:R, pos3:E, pos4:E, pos5:D? But our pattern requires pos4 to be E? Which it is? And pos5=D? Correct? But we are missing: in our pattern, pos3 is the third letter? Which is E? So yes? BREED fits? But now: we have E in pos3? How does that reconcile? 

Wait: our feedback from guess 1 (CRANE) indicated E was present but not in pos5? And now we know E is also in pos4? But BREED has E in both positions? Then why wasn't E in CRANE giving more information? Actually, in CRANE we guessed E at pos5? But BREED has E at pos3 and pos4? So when we guessed E at pos5? That E was missing? Or present? We got '- ' for E? Meaning E is present elsewhere? Actually, BREED has E at pos3 and pos4? So when we guessed E at pos5? It wasn't present? So we got '-'? Meaning there is an E in the word? And that's correct? So it's consistent? 

But now: pattern _ R _ E D? So BREED: _ R (pos3) E D? Pos3 must be the third letter? But in BREED: pos1=B, pos2=R, pos3=E, pos4=E, pos5=D? So the pattern _ R X E D? Where X is E? So the word is B R E E D? Fits? 

Other words: 
- FREED? F R E E D? Similar? 
- GREED: G R E E D?
- KREED? Not common? 
- BREAD? But E in position? BREAD: B R E A D? But A is exposed? And we have E in pos3? and A in pos4? But we need E in pos4? So not matching? 

Actually, words ending with ""EED"" are common? So: BREED, FREED, GREED? But all have E in position 3? And also E in position 4? So the pattern holds: _ R E E D?

Wait, no: our pattern for secret word: 
   pos1: ?
   pos2: R (fixed)
   pos3: ? 
   pos4: E (fixed)
   pos5: D (fixed)

So with examples? 
   BREED: B R E E D → so pos3 is E? Which is different from the E at pos4? So if we have BREED? Then the word would be: 
      pos1: B
      pos2: R
      pos3: E
      pos4: E
      pos5: D

So pattern _ R _ E D? Where the third slot is E? 

So the pattern is: _ R ? E D? And we know the fourth slot is E? Therefore, the word must be (letter) R (letter) E D

Now, if the third letter is E? Then that would be a word? And the first letter must be consonant? Like in BREED? 

Similarly: FLIED? But L and I? I is excluded? FI? But FLIED: F L I E D? Has I? And also? Not _ R pattern? 

What other words? 
- SHOED? S H O E D? But second letter is H? Not R?
- Not matching? 

More: 
- BORED? B O R E D? Second letter O? Not R?
- STREW? S T R E W? Pattern? S T R E W → pos1=S, pos2=T? Not R? 

We must have R at pos2? So words? 

Common ones: BREED, FREED, GREED? Also PLEED? Not common? 

Others: 
- CRED? Only 4 letters? 
- BRED? Not 5 letters? 

Also, other words: 
- BUZZED? But Z? and U? And pattern? B U Z Z E D? Too long? 
But 5-letter: _ R _ E D? 

How about ""ARROWED""? Too long?
Focus: only 5-letter.

List:
- BREED: valid? B R E E D
- FREED: F R E E D
- GREED: G R E E D
- SHREW: no? S H R E W? Pattern? S H R E W? Second letter H? So not?
- BROOD? No D? 

Also, TREAD? But A excluded? 

WRONG: W R O N G? Pattern: W R O N G? Then E and D? But we must have E at pos4 and D at pos5? Here: pos4=N? pos5=G? So not matching? 

Another: ""FRIED"": F R I E D? But I? We know I is excluded? So not? 

Therefore, with E at pos4 and D at pos5? And R at pos2? The only possibilities are words having double E? Like in positions 3 and 4? So BREED, FREED, GREED? And KREED? And PLEED? Not common? 

Also, ""BOWED"": B O W E D? Pattern? B O W E D? Second letter O? Not R? 

""PRUDE"": P R U D E? Pattern? P R U D E? Then pos4=D? But we need E at pos4? D at pos5? Here: pos4=D? pos5=E? So not matching? 

Therefore, the likely candidates are BREED, FREED, GREED? And possibly more? But common? 

Now, in our previous feedback? Also, exclude T and I? 

But BREED, FREED, GREED don't have T or I? 

However, we haven't tested: 
In BREED: letters B and E? But E was already known? 
Similarly? 

But we need to confirm which one? 

For the third guess? We can use this opportunity to test common letters? But we know the word must be one of these... BREED, FREED, GREED? So how do we distinguish? 

We also have other letters? 

Pattern: ? R ? E D? Actually, ? R E E D? Because the third letter? For BREED is E? So it must be E? So the pattern is actually: ? R E E D? 

Therefore, the secret word ends with ""REED"": but starts with B, F, G? etc? 

So the word must be [B,F,G] R E E D? 

But are there others? 
- KREED? K R E E D? 
- TREED? T R E E D? But T is excluded? So not?
- PREED? Not common? 
- DREED? Not common?
- MREED? Not common?
- SREED? Not common?

Therefore, among BREED, FREED, GREED? 

But how to distinguish?

We have exhausted 2 guesses? And now we know:
- Known letters: R, E (double?), D? 
- Known positions: 2=R, 4=E, 5=D? And third position E?
- But also? The triple E? BREED has E at pos3 and E at pos4? 

We haven't guessed any letters? For the first letter? 

But we can guess a word that has either B, F, or G? 

Since we have limited? attempts? We can guess one? 

But let's maximize information? Since we know the pattern is ? R E E D? And the first letter must be one of the consonants? 

We can guess ""BREED""? Then if it's correct? We win? Or if not? Then we know? 

But the feedback would tell us which letters? 

Since we know the positions? We can guess any? 

But we also can guess a different word? That tests more letters? However, the pattern forces the word to have E in pos3? And R pos2? E pos4? D pos5? So the only uncertainty is the first letter? And it must be a consonant that is not excluded? 

Excluded letters: C, A, N, T, I? But BREED, FREED, GREED don't have these? 

We don't know? About B, F, G? Etc? 

So? it cost? 

But we have 4 more guesses? So we can guess one? 

Alternatively, we can guess a word that tests multiple possibilities? But difficult? 

For example, if we guess ""FLAME""? But would not fit the pattern? 

We must guess only valid words? And we must guess a word that matches the pattern? Because we know R? pos2?, E? pos4?, D? pos5? So we must guess a word? That has: 
   pos2: R? 
   pos4: E? 
   pos5: D? 
   and pos3: to be determined? And pos1: to be determined? 

But we believe pos3 is E? So we can guess words? 

But to avoid? Why not? 

For instance, we could guess ""GREET""? But GREET: G R E E T? Then pos5=T? Not D? So no? 

We must have D at pos5? So the pattern forces the ending EED? 

So guess: B R E E D? 

But? F R E E D? 

Or? G R E E D? 

To test? 

But we can guess ""B"" for the first position? But that won't work? 

How about guessing ""BEERS""? But BEERS: B E E R S? Pattern? pos2=E? Not R? 

We cannot change the known positions? 

So? we have to choose:

Option 1: Guess BREED? If correct? End. If incorrect? Then the word must be FREED or GREED? Then guess FREED next? etc. 

Option 2: Guess a word that contains multiple of B, F, G? But not possible? Because the word must fit the pattern? And also? we must include the E at pos4? and R at pos2? So if we guess a word that tests? 

Example: guess ""BREDE""? Not common? 

Guess ""FOREWORD""? Too long? 

I think the only possibilities are BREED, FREED, GREED? So we must choose one? 

Perhaps ""BREED"" is more common? 

But note: we haven't tested B, F, G? So we can't tell? 

We can guess ""OGEE""? Not 5 letters? 

Perhaps use a word that has F at the start? And G? And S? or something? But it must fit? 

Wait? What about ""PROBE""? But pattern? P R O B E? Then pos4=B? not E? etc. 

Not fitting? 

Therefore, we have to guess one of BREED, FREED, GREED? 

Since the word ""FREED"" might be common? But GREED too? 

Alternatively, we can guess ""FREED""? 

But let's think? 

We know the secret word has E at pos3? And we haven't guessed it? Actually, in guess1: CRANE? pos3=A? Which is excluded? And guess2: TRIED? pos3=I? excluded? So E at pos3? was never tested? But we inferred? 

If E is at pos3? Then why did we not get feedback? For E in the first guess? 

In the first guess? We had A at pos3? and E at pos5? and E was '-'? Meaning E is present? but not at pos5? And A was absent? So E was the only one? But at pos3? Then the secret has E at pos3? So when we guessed CRANE? The secret might be BREED? Then:
   C: absent (x)
   R: at pos2? correct? (✓)
   A: absent? (x)
   N: absent? (x)
   E: present? But not at pos5? So in BREED? E is at pos3 and pos4? But we guessed E at pos5? So in the secret? There is E at pos3 and pos4? Therefore, the E at pos5? comparison? At pos5? Secret has D? So E is not at pos5? And E is present at pos3 and/or pos4? So we got '-'? 

Similarly? In guess2: TRIED? Guess: T R I E D?
   T: absent? (x)
   R: correct? pos2? (✓)
   I: absent? (x)
   E: at pos4? and secret has E at pos4? So ✓? 
   D: at pos5? secret D? ✓? 

So both ✓? 

Therefore, the secret word has E? at both pos3 and pos4? So double E? 

Therefore, confirmed pattern: _ R E E D? 

Possible: B, F, G, K? etc? But from common? BREED, FREED, GREED? 

We have to choose one? 

But let's guess? ""GREED"" - it's a common word? 

But we can also guess a word that uses a letter to cover multiple possibilities? But impossible? 

So I'll choose? ""BREED"" for the next guess? 

But wait: we haven't tested B? But if we guess BREED? We'll know? 

Similarly? 

Since we have three choices? And one guess might hit? 

But perhaps we can use the next guess? To test without locking? Not? Because we must guess a word that matches the pattern? Or can we? 

For instance? we can guess ""BLEND"" first? But? letters: B L E N D? but N excluded? and L? 

But also? pattern? ? R ? E D? we must have R at pos2? So we can't guess BLEND? Because pos2 must be R? 

Therefore? we cannot guess words without R? at pos2? 

Therefore? the word must follow: ? R ? E D? And we think? the third is E? 

So we must guess one of them? 

Let's guess? ""FREED"" 
</think>
Based on the feedback:
- **T(x)**: T is not in the word.
- **R(✓)**: R is confirmed at position 2.
- **I(x)**: I is not in the word.
- **E(✓)**: E is confirmed at position 4.
- **D(✓)**: D is confirmed at position 5.

The secret word pattern is: _ R _ E D  
- Position 2: R (fixed)  
- Position 4: E (fixed)  
- Position 5: D (fixed)  
- Positions 1 and 3 are unknown.  

Eliminated letters: C, A, N (from Guess 1) and T, I (from this feedback).  

Given the pattern _ R _ E D, common English words are:
- **BREED**, **FREED**, **GREED** (position 3 must be E, forming a double-E).  
- Other possibilities (like KREED) are less common.  

The first letter could be B, F, G, etc. To maximize information:
- Testing high-frequency consonants for position 1 (B, F, G) is ideal.  
- ""FREED"" tests F (untested letter) while also checking positions for E and D.

<thinking>
The word ""FREED"" fits the pattern and covers a new, common consonant (F). If incorrect, it will provide information to distinguish between BREED/GREED.  
</thinking>

<guess>FREED</guess>",FREED,"We have new feedback from Guess 2: TRIED -> T(x), R(✓), I(x), E(✓), D(✓)

Interpretation:
- T is not in the word (x)
- R is correct and remains in position 2 (✓) — we already knew this
- I is not in the word (x)
- E is correct in position 4 (✓) — this is new information
- D is correct in position 5 (✓) — also new

Therefore, we now know:
- Secret word has R in position 2, E in position 4, D in position 5 → format: _ R _ E D
- Excluded letters: C, A, N, T, I (from both guesses)
- Known present letter from before: E (now placed)
- No other known present letters left? Wait, E was already known and now firmly placed.

So the secret word pattern is: _ R _ E D

We need to fill the first and third positions.

Excluded letters: C, A, N, T, I (so avoid these)
Known letters: R, E, D are fixed in positions 2,4,5.

Remaining possibilities: The first and third positions can be any letter except the excluded ones. We should consider common letters that haven't been tested yet.

Remaining untested letters (from English alphabet): B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

For maximum information gain, we want to test common letters in positions 1 and 3.

Common consonants to test: S, L, B, G, P, etc.

We also have to consider that the entire word must be a valid English word matching _ R _ E D

Possible words: 
Examples: 
- BRUED? Not a word.
- GRUED? Not common.
- BROAD? But O and A: A is excluded? And A is already excluded? Also positions: B R O A D? But we need E in position 4? D in 5? BROAD has O in 3 and A in 4? Conflict.

Actual English words fitting _ R _ E D pattern:
- BREED? But has E in position 3? BREED: B R E E D → pattern _ R _ E D: position 3 is E? Not _ R _ E D? BREED is B R E E D → pos1=B, pos2=R, pos3=E, pos4=E, pos5=D? But in our pattern, position 3 is unknown and position 4 is E? So BREED has E in pos3 and E in pos4? But we have E fixed in pos4? So pos3 can be anything except E? Actually, the pattern is: 
   pos1: ?, 
   pos2: R (fixed), 
   pos3: ? (needs a letter, could be E? but the secret pattern has pos4 E? So if pos3 is E? Then we have E at pos3 and E at pos4? Duplicate E? Possible? But the word must be valid? Also, BREED does have E at pos3? So how does it match? Pattern: _ R _ E D: BREED: pos3 is E? So we write: B R E E D → so in our pattern, we have: pos1:B, pos2:R, pos3:E, pos4:E, pos5:D? But our pattern requires pos4 to be E? Which it is? And pos5=D? Correct? But we are missing: in our pattern, pos3 is the third letter? Which is E? So yes? BREED fits? But now: we have E in pos3? How does that reconcile? 

Wait: our feedback from guess 1 (CRANE) indicated E was present but not in pos5? And now we know E is also in pos4? But BREED has E in both positions? Then why wasn't E in CRANE giving more information? Actually, in CRANE we guessed E at pos5? But BREED has E at pos3 and pos4? So when we guessed E at pos5? That E was missing? Or present? We got '- ' for E? Meaning E is present elsewhere? Actually, BREED has E at pos3 and pos4? So when we guessed E at pos5? It wasn't present? So we got '-'? Meaning there is an E in the word? And that's correct? So it's consistent? 

But now: pattern _ R _ E D? So BREED: _ R (pos3) E D? Pos3 must be the third letter? But in BREED: pos1=B, pos2=R, pos3=E, pos4=E, pos5=D? So the pattern _ R X E D? Where X is E? So the word is B R E E D? Fits? 

Other words: 
- FREED? F R E E D? Similar? 
- GREED: G R E E D?
- KREED? Not common? 
- BREAD? But E in position? BREAD: B R E A D? But A is exposed? And we have E in pos3? and A in pos4? But we need E in pos4? So not matching? 

Actually, words ending with ""EED"" are common? So: BREED, FREED, GREED? But all have E in position 3? And also E in position 4? So the pattern holds: _ R E E D?

Wait, no: our pattern for secret word: 
   pos1: ?
   pos2: R (fixed)
   pos3: ? 
   pos4: E (fixed)
   pos5: D (fixed)

So with examples? 
   BREED: B R E E D → so pos3 is E? Which is different from the E at pos4? So if we have BREED? Then the word would be: 
      pos1: B
      pos2: R
      pos3: E
      pos4: E
      pos5: D

So pattern _ R _ E D? Where the third slot is E? 

So the pattern is: _ R ? E D? And we know the fourth slot is E? Therefore, the word must be (letter) R (letter) E D

Now, if the third letter is E? Then that would be a word? And the first letter must be consonant? Like in BREED? 

Similarly: FLIED? But L and I? I is excluded? FI? But FLIED: F L I E D? Has I? And also? Not _ R pattern? 

What other words? 
- SHOED? S H O E D? But second letter is H? Not R?
- Not matching? 

More: 
- BORED? B O R E D? Second letter O? Not R?
- STREW? S T R E W? Pattern? S T R E W → pos1=S, pos2=T? Not R? 

We must have R at pos2? So words? 

Common ones: BREED, FREED, GREED? Also PLEED? Not common? 

Others: 
- CRED? Only 4 letters? 
- BRED? Not 5 letters? 

Also, other words: 
- BUZZED? But Z? and U? And pattern? B U Z Z E D? Too long? 
But 5-letter: _ R _ E D? 

How about ""ARROWED""? Too long?
Focus: only 5-letter.

List:
- BREED: valid? B R E E D
- FREED: F R E E D
- GREED: G R E E D
- SHREW: no? S H R E W? Pattern? S H R E W? Second letter H? So not?
- BROOD? No D? 

Also, TREAD? But A excluded? 

WRONG: W R O N G? Pattern: W R O N G? Then E and D? But we must have E at pos4 and D at pos5? Here: pos4=N? pos5=G? So not matching? 

Another: ""FRIED"": F R I E D? But I? We know I is excluded? So not? 

Therefore, with E at pos4 and D at pos5? And R at pos2? The only possibilities are words having double E? Like in positions 3 and 4? So BREED, FREED, GREED? And KREED? And PLEED? Not common? 

Also, ""BOWED"": B O W E D? Pattern? B O W E D? Second letter O? Not R? 

""PRUDE"": P R U D E? Pattern? P R U D E? Then pos4=D? But we need E at pos4? D at pos5? Here: pos4=D? pos5=E? So not matching? 

Therefore, the likely candidates are BREED, FREED, GREED? And possibly more? But common? 

Now, in our previous feedback? Also, exclude T and I? 

But BREED, FREED, GREED don't have T or I? 

However, we haven't tested: 
In BREED: letters B and E? But E was already known? 
Similarly? 

But we need to confirm which one? 

For the third guess? We can use this opportunity to test common letters? But we know the word must be one of these... BREED, FREED, GREED? So how do we distinguish? 

We also have other letters? 

Pattern: ? R ? E D? Actually, ? R E E D? Because the third letter? For BREED is E? So it must be E? So the pattern is actually: ? R E E D? 

Therefore, the secret word ends with ""REED"": but starts with B, F, G? etc? 

So the word must be [B,F,G] R E E D? 

But are there others? 
- KREED? K R E E D? 
- TREED? T R E E D? But T is excluded? So not?
- PREED? Not common? 
- DREED? Not common?
- MREED? Not common?
- SREED? Not common?

Therefore, among BREED, FREED, GREED? 

But how to distinguish?

We have exhausted 2 guesses? And now we know:
- Known letters: R, E (double?), D? 
- Known positions: 2=R, 4=E, 5=D? And third position E?
- But also? The triple E? BREED has E at pos3 and E at pos4? 

We haven't guessed any letters? For the first letter? 

But we can guess a word that has either B, F, or G? 

Since we have limited? attempts? We can guess one? 

But let's maximize information? Since we know the pattern is ? R E E D? And the first letter must be one of the consonants? 

We can guess ""BREED""? Then if it's correct? We win? Or if not? Then we know? 

But the feedback would tell us which letters? 

Since we know the positions? We can guess any? 

But we also can guess a different word? That tests more letters? However, the pattern forces the word to have E in pos3? And R pos2? E pos4? D pos5? So the only uncertainty is the first letter? And it must be a consonant that is not excluded? 

Excluded letters: C, A, N, T, I? But BREED, FREED, GREED don't have these? 

We don't know? About B, F, G? Etc? 

So? it cost? 

But we have 4 more guesses? So we can guess one? 

Alternatively, we can guess a word that tests multiple possibilities? But difficult? 

For example, if we guess ""FLAME""? But would not fit the pattern? 

We must guess only valid words? And we must guess a word that matches the pattern? Because we know R? pos2?, E? pos4?, D? pos5? So we must guess a word? That has: 
   pos2: R? 
   pos4: E? 
   pos5: D? 
   and pos3: to be determined? And pos1: to be determined? 

But we believe pos3 is E? So we can guess words? 

But to avoid? Why not? 

For instance, we could guess ""GREET""? But GREET: G R E E T? Then pos5=T? Not D? So no? 

We must have D at pos5? So the pattern forces the ending EED? 

So guess: B R E E D? 

But? F R E E D? 

Or? G R E E D? 

To test? 

But we can guess ""B"" for the first position? But that won't work? 

How about guessing ""BEERS""? But BEERS: B E E R S? Pattern? pos2=E? Not R? 

We cannot change the known positions? 

So? we have to choose:

Option 1: Guess BREED? If correct? End. If incorrect? Then the word must be FREED or GREED? Then guess FREED next? etc. 

Option 2: Guess a word that contains multiple of B, F, G? But not possible? Because the word must fit the pattern? And also? we must include the E at pos4? and R at pos2? So if we guess a word that tests? 

Example: guess ""BREDE""? Not common? 

Guess ""FOREWORD""? Too long? 

I think the only possibilities are BREED, FREED, GREED? So we must choose one? 

Perhaps ""BREED"" is more common? 

But note: we haven't tested B, F, G? So we can't tell? 

We can guess ""OGEE""? Not 5 letters? 

Perhaps use a word that has F at the start? And G? And S? or something? But it must fit? 

Wait? What about ""PROBE""? But pattern? P R O B E? Then pos4=B? not E? etc. 

Not fitting? 

Therefore, we have to guess one of BREED, FREED, GREED? 

Since the word ""FREED"" might be common? But GREED too? 

Alternatively, we can guess ""FREED""? 

But let's think? 

We know the secret word has E at pos3? And we haven't guessed it? Actually, in guess1: CRANE? pos3=A? Which is excluded? And guess2: TRIED? pos3=I? excluded? So E at pos3? was never tested? But we inferred? 

If E is at pos3? Then why did we not get feedback? For E in the first guess? 

In the first guess? We had A at pos3? and E at pos5? and E was '-'? Meaning E is present? but not at pos5? And A was absent? So E was the only one? But at pos3? Then the secret has E at pos3? So when we guessed CRANE? The secret might be BREED? Then:
   C: absent (x)
   R: at pos2? correct? (✓)
   A: absent? (x)
   N: absent? (x)
   E: present? But not at pos5? So in BREED? E is at pos3 and pos4? But we guessed E at pos5? So in the secret? There is E at pos3 and pos4? Therefore, the E at pos5? comparison? At pos5? Secret has D? So E is not at pos5? And E is present at pos3 and/or pos4? So we got '-'? 

Similarly? In guess2: TRIED? Guess: T R I E D?
   T: absent? (x)
   R: correct? pos2? (✓)
   I: absent? (x)
   E: at pos4? and secret has E at pos4? So ✓? 
   D: at pos5? secret D? ✓? 

So both ✓? 

Therefore, the secret word has E? at both pos3 and pos4? So double E? 

Therefore, confirmed pattern: _ R E E D? 

Possible: B, F, G, K? etc? But from common? BREED, FREED, GREED? 

We have to choose one? 

But let's guess? ""GREED"" - it's a common word? 

But we can also guess a word that uses a letter to cover multiple possibilities? But impossible? 

So I'll choose? ""BREED"" for the next guess? 

But wait: we haven't tested B? But if we guess BREED? We'll know? 

Similarly? 

Since we have three choices? And one guess might hit? 

But perhaps we can use the next guess? To test without locking? Not? Because we must guess a word that matches the pattern? Or can we? 

For instance? we can guess ""BLEND"" first? But? letters: B L E N D? but N excluded? and L? 

But also? pattern? ? R ? E D? we must have R at pos2? So we can't guess BLEND? Because pos2 must be R? 

Therefore? we cannot guess words without R? at pos2? 

Therefore? the word must follow: ? R ? E D? And we think? the third is E? 

So we must guess one of them? 

Let's guess? ""FREED""Based on the feedback:
- **T(x)**: T is not in the word.
- **R(✓)**: R is confirmed at position 2.
- **I(x)**: I is not in the word.
- **E(✓)**: E is confirmed at position 4.
- **D(✓)**: D is confirmed at position 5.

The secret word pattern is: _ R _ E D  
- Position 2: R (fixed)  
- Position 4: E (fixed)  
- Position 5: D (fixed)  
- Positions 1 and 3 are unknown.  

Eliminated letters: C, A, N (from Guess 1) and T, I (from this feedback).  

Given the pattern _ R _ E D, common English words are:
- **BREED**, **FREED**, **GREED** (position 3 must be E, forming a double-E).  
- Other possibilities (like KREED) are less common.  

The first letter could be B, F, G, etc. To maximize information:
- Testing high-frequency consonants for position 1 (B, F, G) is ideal.  
- ""FREED"" tests F (untested letter) while also checking positions for E and D.

<thinking>
The word ""FREED"" fits the pattern and covers a new, common consonant (F). If incorrect, it will provide information to distinguish between BREED/GREED.
