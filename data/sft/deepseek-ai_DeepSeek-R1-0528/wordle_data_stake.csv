We are starting the game. We have to make our first guess. 
 Since we have no prior feedback, we want to choose a word that can give us a lot of information.
 Common starting words include those with many vowels and common consonants to maximize the chance of hitting letters in the secret word.

 Some popular starting words are:
   - CRANE
   - SLATE
   - TRACE
   - SALET
   - ROATE

 Let me choose a word that is commonly used: ""CRANE"". It has three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).

 But note: we are allowed only 5-letter words. ""CRANE"" is valid.

 Alternatively, another good word is ""ROATE"". However, ""CRANE"" is very common.

 Since this is the first guess, we'll pick ""CRANE"".

 Remember: after this guess we will get feedback and then adjust accordingly.

 So, our first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: ✓ (correct position, so the 3rd letter is A)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: ✓ (correct position, so the 5th letter is E)

Therefore, we know:
  The secret word has the form: _ _ A _ E
  The letters C, R, and N are not in the word.

We must avoid using C, R, and N in our next guesses.

We also know that the word contains A (in the 3rd position) and E (in the 5th position).

For the next guess, we want to try to find the other three letters (positions 1, 2, and 4) while avoiding the eliminated letters.

We can consider common letters that are still possible. Since we have two fixed letters, we can try to use a word that has:
  - First letter: not C, R, N, and preferably a common consonant.
  - Second letter: not C, R, N, and also common.
  - Fourth letter: not C, R, N, and common.

We also want to maximize the information by including new letters that we haven't tried yet.

Let's list some possible words that fit the pattern _ _ A _ E and avoid C, R, N.

Some words that come to mind:
  - SHALE: S H A L E -> but note we have A in 3rd and E in 5th, so S H A L E -> positions: 1:S, 2:H, 4:L -> but we don't know if L is in the word.
  - SHADE: S H A D E -> 1:S, 2:H, 4:D
  - SHAPE: S H A P E -> 1:S, 2:H, 4:P
  - STALE: S T A L E -> 1:S, 2:T, 4:L -> but T is new, and we haven't eliminated T.

However, note that in the first guess we only eliminated C, R, N. So S, H, D, P, L, T, etc. are all still possible.

But we must also consider that the word might have repeated letters? However, since we don't have any indication of duplicates yet, we can assume no duplicates for now.

We also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let me think of words that use common letters and avoid C, R, N.

Another idea: since we have two vowels already (A and E), the other letters are likely consonants. So we can try to use common consonants: S, T, L, P, D, M, etc.

Possible words:
  - SHAME: S H A M E -> 1:S, 2:H, 4:M
  - STAGE: S T A G E -> 1:S, 2:T, 4:G
  - SLATE: S L A T E -> 1:S, 2:L, 4:T -> but note that we have T in the 4th position? Actually, in SLATE: S L A T E -> so the 4th letter is T. But we also have T in the 2nd position? No, wait: positions: 1:S, 2:L, 3:A, 4:T, 5:E -> so that's valid.

However, we must avoid using letters that we know are not in the word. We don't know about S, L, T, etc. yet.

But note: we have two fixed positions (3rd: A, 5th: E). So we can try a word that has different letters in positions 1,2,4.

We want to maximize the chance of getting more feedback. So we can choose a word that has letters that are common and that we haven't tested.

Let me list some words that fit the pattern _ _ A _ E and do not contain C, R, N:

  - SHADE: S, H, D
  - SHALE: S, H, L
  - SHAME: S, H, M
  - SHAPE: S, H, P
  - STAGE: S, T, G
  - STALE: S, T, L
  - STAKE: S, T, K
  - STAVE: S, T, V
  - SUAVE: S, U, V -> but U is a vowel, and we already have two vowels? It's okay, but maybe less common.

We also have:
  - BLAME: B, L, M -> but note: B is a new letter, and we avoid R? We don't have R in BLAME. But we have to avoid R? Actually, we know R is not in the word, so we cannot use R. BLAME does not contain R, so it's okay.

But note: we have two fixed letters (A and E) and we know the word must be 5 letters. So we can generate a list.

However, we must also consider that the word might have the same letter twice? But without evidence, we assume no duplicates.

I think a good next guess would be one that uses common letters and tests positions 1,2,4.

Let's choose ""SLATE"": because it has S, L, T which are common, and we can get feedback on these.

But wait: in the first guess, we had A and E correct. In ""SLATE"", we have:
  - S: new
  - L: new
  - A: already correct (so we expect a check for A in position 3)
  - T: new
  - E: already correct (so we expect a check for E in position 5)

So the feedback will tell us about S, L, T.

Alternatively, we can choose ""SHADE"" to test S, H, D.

But I think ""SLATE"" is a very common word and covers three common consonants.

However, note that we have already eliminated R, so if we use ""SLATE"", we are testing S, L, T.

But what if the word is ""SHADE""? Then by guessing ""SLATE"", we might not get as much information about the exact letters? Actually, we will get:

  If the secret word is ""SHADE"":
    S: in the word? In ""SHADE"", S is the first letter. But in ""SLATE"", S is the first letter -> so if the secret word has S in the first position, we get a check. Otherwise, if it's in a different position, we get a dash. If not, we get an x.

But we don't know the secret word.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have A and E? Actually, we know A and E are in the word, but we already have them in the correct positions. So we can reuse them? Actually, we must, because we have to form a valid 5-letter word.

But note: we are allowed to reuse letters that we know are in the word? Yes, but we already know A and E are in the word and in the correct positions. So we can use them to form the word.

So I think ""SLATE"" is a good choice.

But let me check: is ""SLATE"" a valid word? Yes.

So we'll go with ""SLATE"".

But wait: what about the possibility that the word has a double letter? We don't have any indication, so we can ignore for now.

Therefore, our next guess is ""SLATE"".

However, we must avoid using letters that we know are not in the word. We don't know about S, L, T, etc. yet.

But note: we have two fixed positions (3rd: A, 5th: E). So we can try a word that has different letters in positions 1,2,4.

We want to maximize the chance of getting more feedback. So we can choose a word that has letters that are common and that we haven't tested.

Let me list some words that fit the pattern _ _ A _ E and do not contain C, R, N:

  - SHADE: S, H, D
  - SHALE: S, H, L
  - SHAME: S, H, M
  - SHAPE: S, H, P
  - STAGE: S, T, G
  - STALE: S, T, L
  - STAKE: S, T, K
  - STAVE: S, T, V
  - SUAVE: S, U, V -> but U is a vowel, and we already have two vowels? It's okay, but maybe less common.

We also have:
  - BLAME: B, L, M -> but note: B is a new letter, and we avoid R? We don't have R in BLAME. But we have to avoid R? Actually, we know R is not in the word, so we cannot use R. BLAME does not contain R, so it's okay.

But note: we have two fixed letters (A and E) and we know the word must be 5 letters. So we can generate a list.

However, we must also consider that the word might have the same letter twice? But without evidence, we assume no duplicates.

I think a good next guess would be one that uses common letters and tests positions 1,2,4.

Let's choose ""SLATE"": because it has S, L, T which are common, and we can get feedback on these.

But wait: in the first guess, we had A and E correct. In ""SLATE"", we have:
  - S: new
  - L: new
  - A: already correct (so we expect a check for A in position 3)
  - T: new
  - E: already correct (so we expect a check for E in position 5)

So the feedback will tell us about S, L, T.

Alternatively, we can choose ""SHADE"" to test S, H, D.

But I think ""SLATE"" is a very common word and covers three common consonants.

However, note that we have already eliminated R, so if we use ""SLATE"", we are testing S, L, T.

But what if the word is ""SHADE""? Then by guessing ""SLATE"", we might not get as much information about the exact letters? Actually, we will get:

  If the secret word is ""SHADE"":
    S: in the word? In ""SHADE"", S is the first letter. But in ""SLATE"", S is the first letter -> so if the secret word has S in the first position, we get a check. Otherwise, if it's in a different position, we get a dash. If not, we get an x.

But we don't know the secret word.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have A and E? Actually, we know A and E are in the word, but we already have them in the correct positions. So we can reuse them? Actually, we must, because we have to form a valid 5-letter word.

But note: we are allowed to reuse letters that we know are in the word? Yes, but we already know A and E are in the word and in the correct positions. So we can use them to form the word.

So I think ""SLATE"" is a good choice.

But let me check: is ""SLATE"" a valid word? Yes.

So we'll go with ""SLATE"".

But wait: what about the possibility that the word has a double letter? We don't have any indication, so we can ignore for now.

Therefore, our next guess is ""SLATE"".

<guess>slate</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, N** are not in the word (marked ""x"").
- **A** is correct and in the 3rd position (marked ""✓"").
- **E** is correct and in the 5th position (marked ""✓"").

This means the secret word has the pattern: `_ _ A _ E`, and it **excludes C, R, N**. 

For the next guess:
- I need to test new letters to uncover the missing positions (1, 2, and 4).
- I chose **""slate""** because:
  - It fits the pattern `_ _ A _ E` (3rd letter A, 5th letter E).
  - It uses common consonants (**S, L, T**) that haven't been tested yet.
  - It avoids the eliminated letters (C, R, N).
  - This maximizes information gain by testing three new letters in key positions.

If ""slate"" is correct, great! If not, the feedback will reveal which of S, L, or T are in the word and their positions.

We are given feedback from the previous guess ""slate"":
  S: ✓ (so the first letter of the secret word is S)
  L: x (L is not in the word)
  A: ✓ (already known, third letter is A)
  T: - (T is in the word but not in the fourth position; so T is present elsewhere)
  E: ✓ (already known, fifth letter is E)

Therefore, we know:
  The secret word is S _ A _ E
  The first letter is S, third is A, fifth is E.
  Letters L is not in the word.
  T is in the word, but not in the fourth position. Since positions 1,3,5 are fixed (S, A, E), T must be in position 2 or 4. But the feedback shows that T was in the fourth position of our guess and got a dash, meaning it's present but not there. Wait, let me interpret:

In ""slate"", we placed T in the fourth position and got a dash (-), meaning that T is in the word but not in the fourth position. Therefore, T must be in position 2 (since position 1 is S, 3 is A, 5 is E). So the only possibility is that the second letter is T? Not necessarily, because the word might have T in the second position, but note we haven't fixed position 2 yet.

Actually, the secret word has T, but not in position 4. Since our guess had T in position 4 and it was wrong, T must be in position 2 (the only remaining spot) or if the word has two T's? But we don't know that.

But note: our first guess ""crane"" had T? No, ""crane"" had C, R, A, N, E. And R and N are not in the word, so no T in the first guess.

Therefore, T is a new letter and must be in the word. The possible positions for T are 2 or 4. But from the feedback of ""slate"", T was placed in position 4 and we got a dash, meaning that position 4 is not T, so T must be in position 2.

Therefore, now we know the secret word is S T A _ E? Or is that necessarily?

Let me explain: the dash (-) for T means that T is in the word but not in the position we guessed. We guessed T in position 4. Therefore, T cannot be in position 4, but it must be in the word. The only other unknown position is position 2 (since 1,3,5 are fixed). Therefore, we can conclude that the second letter must be T.

Therefore, the word is S T A _ E.

Now, we need to find the fourth letter. We know the word is S T A _ E.

We also know from previous feedback:
  Excluded letters: C, R, N, L (from the first and second guesses).
    - First guess: C, R, N are out.
    - Second guess: L is out (marked x).

So we must avoid C, R, N, L.

What letters could the fourth letter be? We have to avoid these and any other letters we might have tested? Only S, T, A, E are known to be in the word, but S, T, A, E are fixed in their positions.

Now, for the fourth letter, we can choose any letter that hasn't been excluded and forms a valid English word.

We need a word of the form S T A ? E.

Let me think of words with that pattern:
  - STAGE: S T A G E
  - STARE: but R is excluded (from first guess: R is x), so it can't be STARE.
  - STALE: but L is excluded (second guess: L is x), so not STALE.
  - STAKE: S T A K E
  - STAVE: S T A V E
  - STATE: S T A T E -> but T is repeated? And we haven't seen a double letter yet. But we don't know if doubles are allowed. However, note we have T already in position 2. In STATE, the fourth letter is T, so that would be two T's? But we must consider.

But we must avoid R and L. Also, N and C are out.

So possible words: STAGE, STAKE, STAVE, STATE, etc.

We haven't tested G, K, V, etc.

We also need to consider that we have no clues about the fourth letter. So we want to guess a word that might be it, or at least test new letters.

But note: if we guess a word, we are making a guess for the entire word. So we can guess one of these words.

We have 6 tries total, and we're on guess 3.

So we can guess, say, ""STAGE"". Why not ""STAKE"" or ""STAVE""?

But let's consider what we have tested:

Known in word: S, T (we inferred), A, E.

Known not in word: C, R, N, L.

We haven't tested many other letters.

But note: in STA? E, the fourth letter is the only missing part.

So we can list possible letters for the fourth spot.

Possible letters that are not excluded: A to Z except C, R, N, L. But also, excluding letters that cannot form words? We must form a valid word.

Let me list some words with S T A _ E:

  - STAGE: G
  - STAKE: K
  - STAVE: V
  - STATE: T (double T)
  - STANE: but N is excluded, so not STANE.
  - STAPE: P? Is ""STAPE"" a word? I think not common; not common in everyday use. Perhaps not valid.
  - STARE: R excluded.
  - STALE: L excluded.

Other possibilities: 
  - STAGE, STAKE, STAVE, STATE are the common ones.

We have to choose one of these. But we don't know which one.

We can still get information if we guess a word that has a new letter? But since we're guessing the entire word, if we guess correctly we win, else we get feedback on the fourth letter.

But note: we are not required to maximize information in this guess because we are almost there. We have four letters known: S, T, A, E are known, and only one letter missing? Actually, we don't have T confirmed by direct evidence? But we inferred by logic.

Wait, let me double-check the feedback:

Feedback of ""slate"": 
  S was first -> correct, so first letter is S.
  L was second -> not in word.
  A was third -> correct.
  T was fourth -> present but not in fourth position? Since T must be in the word and not in fourth, and the only open position is second? So second must be T? Unless there is another position? Only positions 2 and 4 were unknown, but position 4 we tried T and it was present but not there, so it must be in position 2? And we didn't have T in any other position? So yes, position 2 must be T.

Therefore, the word must be S T A ? E.

So we can guess STAGE, for example.

But we want to make sure we don't waste a guess? There are limited tries.

We can choose one that tests a letter we haven't tried? But all letters except the fixed ones are new? Actually, in STAGE, G is new. So if it's not correct, we learn that G is or isn't in the word? But if we guess STAGE and the fourth letter is not G, then the feedback will show:

  If the fourth letter is not G, then:
    We get: S(✓), T(✓), A(✓), G(if it's not the correct letter: might be x if not in word, or dash if in word but wrong position? But the word only has five letters, so G can only be in fourth? Actually, the feedback will tell us about G.

But note: since we know the word is S T A _ E, we can also consider not knowing the fourth letter, so we can guess a word that uses a new letter for the fourth position.

Alternatively, we can guess ""STATE"". Why? Because we know T is in the word, so we can test if there's a double T? But note, we have T in position 2, and then we put T in position 4. If the secret word does not have T in position 4, we get a dash for T? Or if there's no T repeated, then it would be marked as not present? But we already know T is in the word? Actually, if there is no second T, then putting T in position 4 would be marked as dash? No, because if we put a letter that is in the word but not in that position, we get a dash. So even if the word has only one T, and we put a T in a wrong position (like the fourth when the T is actually in the second), we get a dash for the extra T? Only the first occurrence? Actually, Wordle's rule: it would mark the extra T as x? No, because only one T exists. However, the rules of this game state: ""dash"" means the letter is in the word but in the wrong position.

In ""STATE"" if the word is STAGE: 
  S: ✓ (position 1)
  T: ✓ (position 2) -> because the T is in the word? But we placed T in position 2? Yes, and it's correct. So for the T in position 2, we get ✓.
  A: ✓ (position 3)
  T: we placed a second T in position 4. The actual word STAGE has no T in any other position? Only one T (in position 2). Therefore, the fourth T should be marked x? Because T is already used? Or since the T was already used in position 2, the second T would be considered absent? 

According to the game rules: each feedback is per letter, considering whether that specific letter is present and not accounted for? But the standard Wordle rules: after accounting for the correct positions, you then mark letters in wrong positions for the remaining ones? So for STATE vs STAGE:
  Position 1: S matches -> ✓
  Position 2: T matches -> ✓ (so we've used one T from the actual word)
  Position 3: A matches -> ✓
  Position 4: T in guess, but the actual word STAGE has no T left? So T would be x.
  Position 5: E matches -> ✓

So feedback would be: S(✓) T(✓) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)

Therefore, we learn that T is not repeated? But we already know? So that wouldn't help?

I think it's better to avoid guessing STATE? Because it uses T again, wasting a guess? We can choose a word with a new letter.

Therefore, we can guess STAGE, which gives:
  If the secret word is STAGE, we win.
  If not, for example, if the word is STAKE, we get:
     S(✓) T(✓) A(✓) G(x) E(✓) -> and then we know G is not in the word? Actually, G is shown as x because it's not in the word? Then we can try STAKE next? But that uses K.

Similarly, STAVE would give similar.

We have 6 guesses, so we can try one by one? But we might be smarter.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that is not of the pattern but contains multiple possibilities? But no, because we already know the pattern is S T A _ E.

So we must guess S T A ? E.

We can choose one that uses a letter not yet tested? For example, STAKE? But we don't care because we're identifying the letter? Actually, when we guess a word that completes the pattern, we either win or we get a miss on the fourth letter? So we learn whether that particular letter is correct.

But we can only learn about that specific letter? Yes.

So we'll guess ""STAGE"" because it's a common word.

But let me check: STAKE, STAGE, STAVE and STATE are options.

Since we have no information, we might choose arbitrarily? Or we can choose one that tests a common letter.

But commonality: G and K are common? It's hard to tell.

Alternatively, we can notice that in our second guess we had T in the fourth position? No, we used T in the fourth position? But we learned T is not there? So we know T must be the second letter? But we didn't confirm the second letter? How? 

Wait: we didn't test the second letter directly? In the second guess ""slate"", we placed L in the second position? And we got L(x). So we don't know what the second letter is? We inferred that T must be in position 2 because it wasn't in position 4? But T is present in the word? And positions 1,3,5 are known? And position 4 would have been the other place? Therefore, the second letter must be T? Or could there be a double letter? For example, if the word has T in the second and fourth? But we placed T in the fourth and got a dash? That means T is present but not in the fourth position? So it could be only in the second position? If it were in both, then we should have gotten at least a dash for the fourth? But wait: when we put T in the fourth, if there is a T in the fourth in the actual word, we would get a check? We got a dash? Meaning it's present but not there? So if there were two T's, and one is already in the second? But the dash only says that T is present? And then if we had an extra T? Then the dash wouldn't necessarily tell us about duplication? Actually, in the rules, the feedback doesn't indicate duplicates specifically? But it marks each letter individually? 

Therefore, we must consider that T might appear twice? But then, if the secret word had two T's, and we put a T in the fourth position? Even if there is a T in the fourth position, we would have gotten ✓, but we got dash? So no, that implies there is no T in the fourth position? So there is exactly one T? And it must be in position 2? 

Therefore, our inference that the word is S T A ? E is sound.

So we proceed to guess the word by filling the fourth position.

We can choose ""STAGE"" because:
  It uses G, which we haven't seen before? We haven't tested G? Yes.
  And ""STAGE"" is a common word.

Therefore, we guess ""STAGE"".

If it's wrong, we'll get feedback: 
  If the secret word is STAKE, we get: 
    S(✓), T(✓), A(✓), G(x), E(✓) -> meaning G is not in the word? Then we know to try STAKE?
  Similarly, STAVE would be S(✓) T(✓) A(✓) G(x) E(✓) -> then we learn the fourth letter should be K or V? But we only have one more guess? No, we are on guess 3? So we have 4,5,6 left.

So we have room.

Alternatively, there is another word: STANE? N is excluded? So not.

We can also list: 
  STAMPE? Not 5 letters? No.

So STAGE, STAKE, STAVE, STATE (which has two T's) are candidates? But STATE has two T's, and we already know T is in position 2? So if we guess STATE, and the word actually has T in position 4? We already ruled it out? Because the feedback told us T is not in position 4? So the fourth letter cannot be T? Therefore, STATE is not possible? Because if we put T in position 4, we get a dash? But we already know that T is not in position 4? So STATE would have T in both positions? And then for position 4, we'd have T -> dash or something? Actually, in STATE, the fourth letter T would be marked as: since the actual word does not have T in position 4? In our case, we know the word has exactly one T in position 2? So STATE cannot be the secret word? Because STATE has two T's? But we don't know if the secret word has two T's? 

Actually, we know:
  The secret word has at least one T? But possibly more? But the feedback on ""slate"": the T we put in position 4 got a dash? Meaning that T is in the word? But since we've used only one T? And the actual word has at least one T? And that T is not in position 4? Therefore, the T could be in position 2? Or if there is a duplicate T? Then we don't know? But wait, we didn't test position 2? So logically: T must be in position 2? Because there is no other position for it? Positions 1,3,5 are S, A, E? So only position 2? Unless the word has two T's? Then T could be in position 2 and position 4? But we have evidence: when we put T in position 4? We got a dash? That means the secret word has T? But it isn't in position 4? And then we conclude it must be in position 2? But if the word had T in both, then the T we put in position 4 would be a dash? Because it is present but in the wrong position (i.e., position 2)? So yes, we can have a secret word with two T's? But only in positions 2 and 4? But when we put T in position 4, we got a dash? That is consistent with the T actually being in position 2? And not in position 4? But if the T were also in position 4? Then we would have gotten a check for T in position 4? Which we did not? So no, the secret word doesn't have T in position 4? Therefore, if there is a T in position 2, and we didn't test position 2? We don't have direct evidence? But we know T must be in the word? And position 2 is the only place left? So unless there is a duplicate T? But that duplicate would appear elsewhere? Only position 4? Which we already ruled out? Therefore, the second letter must be T? So there is exactly one T? And it is in position 2.

Therefore, the word is S T A ? E.

To confirm: positions 1: S, 2: T, 3: A, 4: ?, 5: E.

And we need the fourth letter which is not C, R, N, L.

So we'll guess ""STAGE"".

<guess>stage</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback:
- **Guess 1: crane**: C❌, R❌, A✅ (3rd position), N❌, E✅ (5th position).  
  → Pattern: `_ _ A _ E`  
  → Excluded: C, R, N  
- **Guess 2: slate**: S✅ (1st position), L❌, A✅ (3rd position), T➖ (not in 4th position), E✅ (5th position).  
  → Pattern: `S _ A _ E` (1st letter confirmed as S)  
  → T is *in* the word but not in the 4th position.  
  → Excluded (new): L  
  → **Inference**: The secret word is `S T A _ E` because:  
    - T must be in the word but not in position 4 (from ➖ feedback on T in ""slate"").  
    - Positions 1, 3, and 5 are fixed (S, A, E), leaving position 2 as the only possible spot for T.  
    - Thus, **position 2 must be T** (exactly one T).  

### Summary of known information:
- **Secret pattern**: `S T A _ E`  
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, N, L  
- **Valid positions**:  
  - ✅ 1st: S  
  - ✅ 2nd: T (inferred logically)  
  - ✅ 3rd: A  
  - ❓ 4th: Unknown letter (not C, R, N, L)  
  - ✅ 5th: E  

### Possible words:
Given `S T A _ E`, common English words include:  
- **STAGE** (4th: G)  
- **STAKE** (4th: K)  
- **STAVE** (4th: V)  
- ~~STATE~~ (4th: T, but T can only appear once based on inference) → Invalid.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test a valid word that fits `S T A _ E` to solve for the missing 4th letter.
- Prioritize common letters (e.g., G, K, V) not yet tested.  
- **STAGE** is chosen because:  
  - Uses **G** (new, untested letter).  
  - Common word, maximizing solve chance.  

If correct, the game ends. If incorrect, the feedback on G will reveal if it belongs in the word (e.g., ➖ or x), narrowing the final letter quickly.  

<guess>stage</guess>",stage,"We are given feedback from the previous guess ""slate"":
  S: ✓ (so the first letter of the secret word is S)
  L: x (L is not in the word)
  A: ✓ (already known, third letter is A)
  T: - (T is in the word but not in the fourth position; so T is present elsewhere)
  E: ✓ (already known, fifth letter is E)

Therefore, we know:
  The secret word is S _ A _ E
  The first letter is S, third is A, fifth is E.
  Letters L is not in the word.
  T is in the word, but not in the fourth position. Since positions 1,3,5 are fixed (S, A, E), T must be in position 2 or 4. But the feedback shows that T was in the fourth position of our guess and got a dash, meaning it's present but not there. Wait, let me interpret:

In ""slate"", we placed T in the fourth position and got a dash (-), meaning that T is in the word but not in the fourth position. Therefore, T must be in position 2 (since position 1 is S, 3 is A, 5 is E). So the only possibility is that the second letter is T? Not necessarily, because the word might have T in the second position, but note we haven't fixed position 2 yet.

Actually, the secret word has T, but not in position 4. Since our guess had T in position 4 and it was wrong, T must be in position 2 (the only remaining spot) or if the word has two T's? But we don't know that.

But note: our first guess ""crane"" had T? No, ""crane"" had C, R, A, N, E. And R and N are not in the word, so no T in the first guess.

Therefore, T is a new letter and must be in the word. The possible positions for T are 2 or 4. But from the feedback of ""slate"", T was placed in position 4 and we got a dash, meaning that position 4 is not T, so T must be in position 2.

Therefore, now we know the secret word is S T A _ E? Or is that necessarily?

Let me explain: the dash (-) for T means that T is in the word but not in the position we guessed. We guessed T in position 4. Therefore, T cannot be in position 4, but it must be in the word. The only other unknown position is position 2 (since 1,3,5 are fixed). Therefore, we can conclude that the second letter must be T.

Therefore, the word is S T A _ E.

Now, we need to find the fourth letter. We know the word is S T A _ E.

We also know from previous feedback:
  Excluded letters: C, R, N, L (from the first and second guesses).
    - First guess: C, R, N are out.
    - Second guess: L is out (marked x).

So we must avoid C, R, N, L.

What letters could the fourth letter be? We have to avoid these and any other letters we might have tested? Only S, T, A, E are known to be in the word, but S, T, A, E are fixed in their positions.

Now, for the fourth letter, we can choose any letter that hasn't been excluded and forms a valid English word.

We need a word of the form S T A ? E.

Let me think of words with that pattern:
  - STAGE: S T A G E
  - STARE: but R is excluded (from first guess: R is x), so it can't be STARE.
  - STALE: but L is excluded (second guess: L is x), so not STALE.
  - STAKE: S T A K E
  - STAVE: S T A V E
  - STATE: S T A T E -> but T is repeated? And we haven't seen a double letter yet. But we don't know if doubles are allowed. However, note we have T already in position 2. In STATE, the fourth letter is T, so that would be two T's? But we must consider.

But we must avoid R and L. Also, N and C are out.

So possible words: STAGE, STAKE, STAVE, STATE, etc.

We haven't tested G, K, V, etc.

We also need to consider that we have no clues about the fourth letter. So we want to guess a word that might be it, or at least test new letters.

But note: if we guess a word, we are making a guess for the entire word. So we can guess one of these words.

We have 6 tries total, and we're on guess 3.

So we can guess, say, ""STAGE"". Why not ""STAKE"" or ""STAVE""?

But let's consider what we have tested:

Known in word: S, T (we inferred), A, E.

Known not in word: C, R, N, L.

We haven't tested many other letters.

But note: in STA? E, the fourth letter is the only missing part.

So we can list possible letters for the fourth spot.

Possible letters that are not excluded: A to Z except C, R, N, L. But also, excluding letters that cannot form words? We must form a valid word.

Let me list some words with S T A _ E:

  - STAGE: G
  - STAKE: K
  - STAVE: V
  - STATE: T (double T)
  - STANE: but N is excluded, so not STANE.
  - STAPE: P? Is ""STAPE"" a word? I think not common; not common in everyday use. Perhaps not valid.
  - STARE: R excluded.
  - STALE: L excluded.

Other possibilities: 
  - STAGE, STAKE, STAVE, STATE are the common ones.

We have to choose one of these. But we don't know which one.

We can still get information if we guess a word that has a new letter? But since we're guessing the entire word, if we guess correctly we win, else we get feedback on the fourth letter.

But note: we are not required to maximize information in this guess because we are almost there. We have four letters known: S, T, A, E are known, and only one letter missing? Actually, we don't have T confirmed by direct evidence? But we inferred by logic.

Wait, let me double-check the feedback:

Feedback of ""slate"": 
  S was first -> correct, so first letter is S.
  L was second -> not in word.
  A was third -> correct.
  T was fourth -> present but not in fourth position? Since T must be in the word and not in fourth, and the only open position is second? So second must be T? Unless there is another position? Only positions 2 and 4 were unknown, but position 4 we tried T and it was present but not there, so it must be in position 2? And we didn't have T in any other position? So yes, position 2 must be T.

Therefore, the word must be S T A ? E.

So we can guess STAGE, for example.

But we want to make sure we don't waste a guess? There are limited tries.

We can choose one that tests a letter we haven't tried? But all letters except the fixed ones are new? Actually, in STAGE, G is new. So if it's not correct, we learn that G is or isn't in the word? But if we guess STAGE and the fourth letter is not G, then the feedback will show:

  If the fourth letter is not G, then:
    We get: S(✓), T(✓), A(✓), G(if it's not the correct letter: might be x if not in word, or dash if in word but wrong position? But the word only has five letters, so G can only be in fourth? Actually, the feedback will tell us about G.

But note: since we know the word is S T A _ E, we can also consider not knowing the fourth letter, so we can guess a word that uses a new letter for the fourth position.

Alternatively, we can guess ""STATE"". Why? Because we know T is in the word, so we can test if there's a double T? But note, we have T in position 2, and then we put T in position 4. If the secret word does not have T in position 4, we get a dash for T? Or if there's no T repeated, then it would be marked as not present? But we already know T is in the word? Actually, if there is no second T, then putting T in position 4 would be marked as dash? No, because if we put a letter that is in the word but not in that position, we get a dash. So even if the word has only one T, and we put a T in a wrong position (like the fourth when the T is actually in the second), we get a dash for the extra T? Only the first occurrence? Actually, Wordle's rule: it would mark the extra T as x? No, because only one T exists. However, the rules of this game state: ""dash"" means the letter is in the word but in the wrong position.

In ""STATE"" if the word is STAGE: 
  S: ✓ (position 1)
  T: ✓ (position 2) -> because the T is in the word? But we placed T in position 2? Yes, and it's correct. So for the T in position 2, we get ✓.
  A: ✓ (position 3)
  T: we placed a second T in position 4. The actual word STAGE has no T in any other position? Only one T (in position 2). Therefore, the fourth T should be marked x? Because T is already used? Or since the T was already used in position 2, the second T would be considered absent? 

According to the game rules: each feedback is per letter, considering whether that specific letter is present and not accounted for? But the standard Wordle rules: after accounting for the correct positions, you then mark letters in wrong positions for the remaining ones? So for STATE vs STAGE:
  Position 1: S matches -> ✓
  Position 2: T matches -> ✓ (so we've used one T from the actual word)
  Position 3: A matches -> ✓
  Position 4: T in guess, but the actual word STAGE has no T left? So T would be x.
  Position 5: E matches -> ✓

So feedback would be: S(✓) T(✓) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)

Therefore, we learn that T is not repeated? But we already know? So that wouldn't help?

I think it's better to avoid guessing STATE? Because it uses T again, wasting a guess? We can choose a word with a new letter.

Therefore, we can guess STAGE, which gives:
  If the secret word is STAGE, we win.
  If not, for example, if the word is STAKE, we get:
     S(✓) T(✓) A(✓) G(x) E(✓) -> and then we know G is not in the word? Actually, G is shown as x because it's not in the word? Then we can try STAKE next? But that uses K.

Similarly, STAVE would give similar.

We have 6 guesses, so we can try one by one? But we might be smarter.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that is not of the pattern but contains multiple possibilities? But no, because we already know the pattern is S T A _ E.

So we must guess S T A ? E.

We can choose one that uses a letter not yet tested? For example, STAKE? But we don't care because we're identifying the letter? Actually, when we guess a word that completes the pattern, we either win or we get a miss on the fourth letter? So we learn whether that particular letter is correct.

But we can only learn about that specific letter? Yes.

So we'll guess ""STAGE"" because it's a common word.

But let me check: STAKE, STAGE, STAVE and STATE are options.

Since we have no information, we might choose arbitrarily? Or we can choose one that tests a common letter.

But commonality: G and K are common? It's hard to tell.

Alternatively, we can notice that in our second guess we had T in the fourth position? No, we used T in the fourth position? But we learned T is not there? So we know T must be the second letter? But we didn't confirm the second letter? How? 

Wait: we didn't test the second letter directly? In the second guess ""slate"", we placed L in the second position? And we got L(x). So we don't know what the second letter is? We inferred that T must be in position 2 because it wasn't in position 4? But T is present in the word? And positions 1,3,5 are known? And position 4 would have been the other place? Therefore, the second letter must be T? Or could there be a double letter? For example, if the word has T in the second and fourth? But we placed T in the fourth and got a dash? That means T is present but not in the fourth position? So it could be only in the second position? If it were in both, then we should have gotten at least a dash for the fourth? But wait: when we put T in the fourth, if there is a T in the fourth in the actual word, we would get a check? We got a dash? Meaning it's present but not there? So if there were two T's, and one is already in the second? But the dash only says that T is present? And then if we had an extra T? Then the dash wouldn't necessarily tell us about duplication? Actually, in the rules, the feedback doesn't indicate duplicates specifically? But it marks each letter individually? 

Therefore, we must consider that T might appear twice? But then, if the secret word had two T's, and we put a T in the fourth position? Even if there is a T in the fourth position, we would have gotten ✓, but we got dash? So no, that implies there is no T in the fourth position? So there is exactly one T? And it must be in position 2? 

Therefore, our inference that the word is S T A ? E is sound.

So we proceed to guess the word by filling the fourth position.

We can choose ""STAGE"" because:
  It uses G, which we haven't seen before? We haven't tested G? Yes.
  And ""STAGE"" is a common word.

Therefore, we guess ""STAGE"".

If it's wrong, we'll get feedback: 
  If the secret word is STAKE, we get: 
    S(✓), T(✓), A(✓), G(x), E(✓) -> meaning G is not in the word? Then we know to try STAKE?
  Similarly, STAVE would be S(✓) T(✓) A(✓) G(x) E(✓) -> then we learn the fourth letter should be K or V? But we only have one more guess? No, we are on guess 3? So we have 4,5,6 left.

So we have room.

Alternatively, there is another word: STANE? N is excluded? So not.

We can also list: 
  STAMPE? Not 5 letters? No.

So STAGE, STAKE, STAVE, STATE (which has two T's) are candidates? But STATE has two T's, and we already know T is in position 2? So if we guess STATE, and the word actually has T in position 4? We already ruled it out? Because the feedback told us T is not in position 4? So the fourth letter cannot be T? Therefore, STATE is not possible? Because if we put T in position 4, we get a dash? But we already know that T is not in position 4? So STATE would have T in both positions? And then for position 4, we'd have T -> dash or something? Actually, in STATE, the fourth letter T would be marked as: since the actual word does not have T in position 4? In our case, we know the word has exactly one T in position 2? So STATE cannot be the secret word? Because STATE has two T's? But we don't know if the secret word has two T's? 

Actually, we know:
  The secret word has at least one T? But possibly more? But the feedback on ""slate"": the T we put in position 4 got a dash? Meaning that T is in the word? But since we've used only one T? And the actual word has at least one T? And that T is not in position 4? Therefore, the T could be in position 2? Or if there is a duplicate T? Then we don't know? But wait, we didn't test position 2? So logically: T must be in position 2? Because there is no other position for it? Positions 1,3,5 are S, A, E? So only position 2? Unless the word has two T's? Then T could be in position 2 and position 4? But we have evidence: when we put T in position 4? We got a dash? That means the secret word has T? But it isn't in position 4? And then we conclude it must be in position 2? But if the word had T in both, then the T we put in position 4 would be a dash? Because it is present but in the wrong position (i.e., position 2)? So yes, we can have a secret word with two T's? But only in positions 2 and 4? But when we put T in position 4, we got a dash? That is consistent with the T actually being in position 2? And not in position 4? But if the T were also in position 4? Then we would have gotten a check for T in position 4? Which we did not? So no, the secret word doesn't have T in position 4? Therefore, if there is a T in position 2, and we didn't test position 2? We don't have direct evidence? But we know T must be in the word? And position 2 is the only place left? So unless there is a duplicate T? But that duplicate would appear elsewhere? Only position 4? Which we already ruled out? Therefore, the second letter must be T? So there is exactly one T? And it is in position 2.

Therefore, the word is S T A ? E.

To confirm: positions 1: S, 2: T, 3: A, 4: ?, 5: E.

And we need the fourth letter which is not C, R, N, L.

So we'll guess ""STAGE"".

<guess>stage</guess>Based on the feedback:
- **Guess 1: crane**: C❌, R❌, A✅ (3rd position), N❌, E✅ (5th position).  
  → Pattern: `_ _ A _ E`  
  → Excluded: C, R, N  
- **Guess 2: slate**: S✅ (1st position), L❌, A✅ (3rd position), T➖ (not in 4th position), E✅ (5th position).  
  → Pattern: `S _ A _ E` (1st letter confirmed as S)  
  → T is *in* the word but not in the 4th position.  
  → Excluded (new): L  
  → **Inference**: The secret word is `S T A _ E` because:  
    - T must be in the word but not in position 4 (from ➖ feedback on T in ""slate"").  
    - Positions 1, 3, and 5 are fixed (S, A, E), leaving position 2 as the only possible spot for T.  
    - Thus, **position 2 must be T** (exactly one T).  

### Summary of known information:
- **Secret pattern**: `S T A _ E`  
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, N, L  
- **Valid positions**:  
  - ✅ 1st: S  
  - ✅ 2nd: T (inferred logically)  
  - ✅ 3rd: A  
  - ❓ 4th: Unknown letter (not C, R, N, L)  
  - ✅ 5th: E  

### Possible words:
Given `S T A _ E`, common English words include:  
- **STAGE** (4th: G)  
- **STAKE** (4th: K)  
- **STAVE** (4th: V)  
- ~~STATE~~ (4th: T, but T can only appear once based on inference) → Invalid.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test a valid word that fits `S T A _ E` to solve for the missing 4th letter.
- Prioritize common letters (e.g., G, K, V) not yet tested.  
- **STAGE** is chosen because:  
  - Uses **G** (new, untested letter).  
  - Common word, maximizing solve chance.  

If correct, the game ends. If incorrect, the feedback on G will reveal if it belongs in the word (e.g., ➖ or x), narrowing the final letter quickly.",Guess 3: stage -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) A(✓) G(x) E(✓),FAIL

- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have to make our first guess. 
 Since we have no prior feedback, we want to choose a word that can give us a lot of information.
 Common starting words include those with many vowels and common consonants to maximize the chance of hitting letters in the secret word.

 Some popular starting words are:
   - CRANE
   - SLATE
   - TRACE
   - SALET
   - ROATE

 Let me choose a word that is commonly used: ""CRANE"". It has three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).

 But note: we are allowed only 5-letter words. ""CRANE"" is valid.

 Alternatively, another good word is ""ROATE"". However, ""CRANE"" is very common.

 Since this is the first guess, we'll pick ""CRANE"".

 Remember: after this guess we will get feedback and then adjust accordingly.

 So, our first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: ✓ (correct position, so the 3rd letter is A)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: ✓ (correct position, so the 5th letter is E)

Therefore, we know:
  The secret word has the form: _ _ A _ E
  The letters C, R, and N are not in the word.

We must avoid using C, R, and N in our next guesses.

We also know that the word contains A (in the 3rd position) and E (in the 5th position).

For the next guess, we want to try to find the other three letters (positions 1, 2, and 4) while avoiding the eliminated letters.

We can consider common letters that are still possible. Since we have two fixed letters, we can try to use a word that has:
  - First letter: not C, R, N, and preferably a common consonant.
  - Second letter: not C, R, N, and also common.
  - Fourth letter: not C, R, N, and common.

We also want to maximize the information by including new letters that we haven't tried yet.

Let's list some possible words that fit the pattern _ _ A _ E and avoid C, R, N.

Some words that come to mind:
  - SHALE: S H A L E -> but note we have A in 3rd and E in 5th, so S H A L E -> positions: 1:S, 2:H, 4:L -> but we don't know if L is in the word.
  - SHADE: S H A D E -> 1:S, 2:H, 4:D
  - SHAPE: S H A P E -> 1:S, 2:H, 4:P
  - STALE: S T A L E -> 1:S, 2:T, 4:L -> but T is new, and we haven't eliminated T.

However, note that in the first guess we only eliminated C, R, N. So S, H, D, P, L, T, etc. are all still possible.

But we must also consider that the word might have repeated letters? However, since we don't have any indication of duplicates yet, we can assume no duplicates for now.

We also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let me think of words that use common letters and avoid C, R, N.

Another idea: since we have two vowels already (A and E), the other letters are likely consonants. So we can try to use common consonants: S, T, L, P, D, M, etc.

Possible words:
  - SHAME: S H A M E -> 1:S, 2:H, 4:M
  - STAGE: S T A G E -> 1:S, 2:T, 4:G
  - SLATE: S L A T E -> 1:S, 2:L, 4:T -> but note that we have T in the 4th position? Actually, in SLATE: S L A T E -> so the 4th letter is T. But we also have T in the 2nd position? No, wait: positions: 1:S, 2:L, 3:A, 4:T, 5:E -> so that's valid.

However, we must avoid using letters that we know are not in the word. We don't know about S, L, T, etc. yet.

But note: we have two fixed positions (3rd: A, 5th: E). So we can try a word that has different letters in positions 1,2,4.

We want to maximize the chance of getting more feedback. So we can choose a word that has letters that are common and that we haven't tested.

Let me list some words that fit the pattern _ _ A _ E and do not contain C, R, N:

  - SHADE: S, H, D
  - SHALE: S, H, L
  - SHAME: S, H, M
  - SHAPE: S, H, P
  - STAGE: S, T, G
  - STALE: S, T, L
  - STAKE: S, T, K
  - STAVE: S, T, V
  - SUAVE: S, U, V -> but U is a vowel, and we already have two vowels? It's okay, but maybe less common.

We also have:
  - BLAME: B, L, M -> but note: B is a new letter, and we avoid R? We don't have R in BLAME. But we have to avoid R? Actually, we know R is not in the word, so we cannot use R. BLAME does not contain R, so it's okay.

But note: we have two fixed letters (A and E) and we know the word must be 5 letters. So we can generate a list.

However, we must also consider that the word might have the same letter twice? But without evidence, we assume no duplicates.

I think a good next guess would be one that uses common letters and tests positions 1,2,4.

Let's choose ""SLATE"": because it has S, L, T which are common, and we can get feedback on these.

But wait: in the first guess, we had A and E correct. In ""SLATE"", we have:
  - S: new
  - L: new
  - A: already correct (so we expect a check for A in position 3)
  - T: new
  - E: already correct (so we expect a check for E in position 5)

So the feedback will tell us about S, L, T.

Alternatively, we can choose ""SHADE"" to test S, H, D.

But I think ""SLATE"" is a very common word and covers three common consonants.

However, note that we have already eliminated R, so if we use ""SLATE"", we are testing S, L, T.

But what if the word is ""SHADE""? Then by guessing ""SLATE"", we might not get as much information about the exact letters? Actually, we will get:

  If the secret word is ""SHADE"":
    S: in the word? In ""SHADE"", S is the first letter. But in ""SLATE"", S is the first letter -> so if the secret word has S in the first position, we get a check. Otherwise, if it's in a different position, we get a dash. If not, we get an x.

But we don't know the secret word.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have A and E? Actually, we know A and E are in the word, but we already have them in the correct positions. So we can reuse them? Actually, we must, because we have to form a valid 5-letter word.

But note: we are allowed to reuse letters that we know are in the word? Yes, but we already know A and E are in the word and in the correct positions. So we can use them to form the word.

So I think ""SLATE"" is a good choice.

But let me check: is ""SLATE"" a valid word? Yes.

So we'll go with ""SLATE"".

But wait: what about the possibility that the word has a double letter? We don't have any indication, so we can ignore for now.

Therefore, our next guess is ""SLATE"".

<guess>slate</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, N** are not in the word (marked ""x"").
- **A** is correct and in the 3rd position (marked ""✓"").
- **E** is correct and in the 5th position (marked ""✓"").

This means the secret word has the pattern: `_ _ A _ E`, and it **excludes C, R, N**. 

For the next guess:
- I need to test new letters to uncover the missing positions (1, 2, and 4).
- I chose **""slate""** because:
  - It fits the pattern `_ _ A _ E` (3rd letter A, 5th letter E).
  - It uses common consonants (**S, L, T**) that haven't been tested yet.
  - It avoids the eliminated letters (C, R, N).
  - This maximizes information gain by testing three new letters in key positions.

If ""slate"" is correct, great! If not, the feedback will reveal which of S, L, or T are in the word and their positions.

<guess>slate</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(-) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the previous guess ""slate"":
  S: ✓ (so the first letter of the secret word is S)
  L: x (L is not in the word)
  A: ✓ (already known, third letter is A)
  T: - (T is in the word but not in the fourth position; so T is present elsewhere)
  E: ✓ (already known, fifth letter is E)

Therefore, we know:
  The secret word is S _ A _ E
  The first letter is S, third is A, fifth is E.
  Letters L is not in the word.
  T is in the word, but not in the fourth position. Since positions 1,3,5 are fixed (S, A, E), T must be in position 2 or 4. But the feedback shows that T was in the fourth position of our guess and got a dash, meaning it's present but not there. Wait, let me interpret:

In ""slate"", we placed T in the fourth position and got a dash (-), meaning that T is in the word but not in the fourth position. Therefore, T must be in position 2 (since position 1 is S, 3 is A, 5 is E). So the only possibility is that the second letter is T? Not necessarily, because the word might have T in the second position, but note we haven't fixed position 2 yet.

Actually, the secret word has T, but not in position 4. Since our guess had T in position 4 and it was wrong, T must be in position 2 (the only remaining spot) or if the word has two T's? But we don't know that.

But note: our first guess ""crane"" had T? No, ""crane"" had C, R, A, N, E. And R and N are not in the word, so no T in the first guess.

Therefore, T is a new letter and must be in the word. The possible positions for T are 2 or 4. But from the feedback of ""slate"", T was placed in position 4 and we got a dash, meaning that position 4 is not T, so T must be in position 2.

Therefore, now we know the secret word is S T A _ E? Or is that necessarily?

Let me explain: the dash (-) for T means that T is in the word but not in the position we guessed. We guessed T in position 4. Therefore, T cannot be in position 4, but it must be in the word. The only other unknown position is position 2 (since 1,3,5 are fixed). Therefore, we can conclude that the second letter must be T.

Therefore, the word is S T A _ E.

Now, we need to find the fourth letter. We know the word is S T A _ E.

We also know from previous feedback:
  Excluded letters: C, R, N, L (from the first and second guesses).
    - First guess: C, R, N are out.
    - Second guess: L is out (marked x).

So we must avoid C, R, N, L.

What letters could the fourth letter be? We have to avoid these and any other letters we might have tested? Only S, T, A, E are known to be in the word, but S, T, A, E are fixed in their positions.

Now, for the fourth letter, we can choose any letter that hasn't been excluded and forms a valid English word.

We need a word of the form S T A ? E.

Let me think of words with that pattern:
  - STAGE: S T A G E
  - STARE: but R is excluded (from first guess: R is x), so it can't be STARE.
  - STALE: but L is excluded (second guess: L is x), so not STALE.
  - STAKE: S T A K E
  - STAVE: S T A V E
  - STATE: S T A T E -> but T is repeated? And we haven't seen a double letter yet. But we don't know if doubles are allowed. However, note we have T already in position 2. In STATE, the fourth letter is T, so that would be two T's? But we must consider.

But we must avoid R and L. Also, N and C are out.

So possible words: STAGE, STAKE, STAVE, STATE, etc.

We haven't tested G, K, V, etc.

We also need to consider that we have no clues about the fourth letter. So we want to guess a word that might be it, or at least test new letters.

But note: if we guess a word, we are making a guess for the entire word. So we can guess one of these words.

We have 6 tries total, and we're on guess 3.

So we can guess, say, ""STAGE"". Why not ""STAKE"" or ""STAVE""?

But let's consider what we have tested:

Known in word: S, T (we inferred), A, E.

Known not in word: C, R, N, L.

We haven't tested many other letters.

But note: in STA? E, the fourth letter is the only missing part.

So we can list possible letters for the fourth spot.

Possible letters that are not excluded: A to Z except C, R, N, L. But also, excluding letters that cannot form words? We must form a valid word.

Let me list some words with S T A _ E:

  - STAGE: G
  - STAKE: K
  - STAVE: V
  - STATE: T (double T)
  - STANE: but N is excluded, so not STANE.
  - STAPE: P? Is ""STAPE"" a word? I think not common; not common in everyday use. Perhaps not valid.
  - STARE: R excluded.
  - STALE: L excluded.

Other possibilities: 
  - STAGE, STAKE, STAVE, STATE are the common ones.

We have to choose one of these. But we don't know which one.

We can still get information if we guess a word that has a new letter? But since we're guessing the entire word, if we guess correctly we win, else we get feedback on the fourth letter.

But note: we are not required to maximize information in this guess because we are almost there. We have four letters known: S, T, A, E are known, and only one letter missing? Actually, we don't have T confirmed by direct evidence? But we inferred by logic.

Wait, let me double-check the feedback:

Feedback of ""slate"": 
  S was first -> correct, so first letter is S.
  L was second -> not in word.
  A was third -> correct.
  T was fourth -> present but not in fourth position? Since T must be in the word and not in fourth, and the only open position is second? So second must be T? Unless there is another position? Only positions 2 and 4 were unknown, but position 4 we tried T and it was present but not there, so it must be in position 2? And we didn't have T in any other position? So yes, position 2 must be T.

Therefore, the word must be S T A ? E.

So we can guess STAGE, for example.

But we want to make sure we don't waste a guess? There are limited tries.

We can choose one that tests a letter we haven't tried? But all letters except the fixed ones are new? Actually, in STAGE, G is new. So if it's not correct, we learn that G is or isn't in the word? But if we guess STAGE and the fourth letter is not G, then the feedback will show:

  If the fourth letter is not G, then:
    We get: S(✓), T(✓), A(✓), G(if it's not the correct letter: might be x if not in word, or dash if in word but wrong position? But the word only has five letters, so G can only be in fourth? Actually, the feedback will tell us about G.

But note: since we know the word is S T A _ E, we can also consider not knowing the fourth letter, so we can guess a word that uses a new letter for the fourth position.

Alternatively, we can guess ""STATE"". Why? Because we know T is in the word, so we can test if there's a double T? But note, we have T in position 2, and then we put T in position 4. If the secret word does not have T in position 4, we get a dash for T? Or if there's no T repeated, then it would be marked as not present? But we already know T is in the word? Actually, if there is no second T, then putting T in position 4 would be marked as dash? No, because if we put a letter that is in the word but not in that position, we get a dash. So even if the word has only one T, and we put a T in a wrong position (like the fourth when the T is actually in the second), we get a dash for the extra T? Only the first occurrence? Actually, Wordle's rule: it would mark the extra T as x? No, because only one T exists. However, the rules of this game state: ""dash"" means the letter is in the word but in the wrong position.

In ""STATE"" if the word is STAGE: 
  S: ✓ (position 1)
  T: ✓ (position 2) -> because the T is in the word? But we placed T in position 2? Yes, and it's correct. So for the T in position 2, we get ✓.
  A: ✓ (position 3)
  T: we placed a second T in position 4. The actual word STAGE has no T in any other position? Only one T (in position 2). Therefore, the fourth T should be marked x? Because T is already used? Or since the T was already used in position 2, the second T would be considered absent? 

According to the game rules: each feedback is per letter, considering whether that specific letter is present and not accounted for? But the standard Wordle rules: after accounting for the correct positions, you then mark letters in wrong positions for the remaining ones? So for STATE vs STAGE:
  Position 1: S matches -> ✓
  Position 2: T matches -> ✓ (so we've used one T from the actual word)
  Position 3: A matches -> ✓
  Position 4: T in guess, but the actual word STAGE has no T left? So T would be x.
  Position 5: E matches -> ✓

So feedback would be: S(✓) T(✓) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)

Therefore, we learn that T is not repeated? But we already know? So that wouldn't help?

I think it's better to avoid guessing STATE? Because it uses T again, wasting a guess? We can choose a word with a new letter.

Therefore, we can guess STAGE, which gives:
  If the secret word is STAGE, we win.
  If not, for example, if the word is STAKE, we get:
     S(✓) T(✓) A(✓) G(x) E(✓) -> and then we know G is not in the word? Actually, G is shown as x because it's not in the word? Then we can try STAKE next? But that uses K.

Similarly, STAVE would give similar.

We have 6 guesses, so we can try one by one? But we might be smarter.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that is not of the pattern but contains multiple possibilities? But no, because we already know the pattern is S T A _ E.

So we must guess S T A ? E.

We can choose one that uses a letter not yet tested? For example, STAKE? But we don't care because we're identifying the letter? Actually, when we guess a word that completes the pattern, we either win or we get a miss on the fourth letter? So we learn whether that particular letter is correct.

But we can only learn about that specific letter? Yes.

So we'll guess ""STAGE"" because it's a common word.

But let me check: STAKE, STAGE, STAVE and STATE are options.

Since we have no information, we might choose arbitrarily? Or we can choose one that tests a common letter.

But commonality: G and K are common? It's hard to tell.

Alternatively, we can notice that in our second guess we had T in the fourth position? No, we used T in the fourth position? But we learned T is not there? So we know T must be the second letter? But we didn't confirm the second letter? How? 

Wait: we didn't test the second letter directly? In the second guess ""slate"", we placed L in the second position? And we got L(x). So we don't know what the second letter is? We inferred that T must be in position 2 because it wasn't in position 4? But T is present in the word? And positions 1,3,5 are known? And position 4 would have been the other place? Therefore, the second letter must be T? Or could there be a double letter? For example, if the word has T in the second and fourth? But we placed T in the fourth and got a dash? That means T is present but not in the fourth position? So it could be only in the second position? If it were in both, then we should have gotten at least a dash for the fourth? But wait: when we put T in the fourth, if there is a T in the fourth in the actual word, we would get a check? We got a dash? Meaning it's present but not there? So if there were two T's, and one is already in the second? But the dash only says that T is present? And then if we had an extra T? Then the dash wouldn't necessarily tell us about duplication? Actually, in the rules, the feedback doesn't indicate duplicates specifically? But it marks each letter individually? 

Therefore, we must consider that T might appear twice? But then, if the secret word had two T's, and we put a T in the fourth position? Even if there is a T in the fourth position, we would have gotten ✓, but we got dash? So no, that implies there is no T in the fourth position? So there is exactly one T? And it must be in position 2? 

Therefore, our inference that the word is S T A ? E is sound.

So we proceed to guess the word by filling the fourth position.

We can choose ""STAGE"" because:
  It uses G, which we haven't seen before? We haven't tested G? Yes.
  And ""STAGE"" is a common word.

Therefore, we guess ""STAGE"".

If it's wrong, we'll get feedback: 
  If the secret word is STAKE, we get: 
    S(✓), T(✓), A(✓), G(x), E(✓) -> meaning G is not in the word? Then we know to try STAKE?
  Similarly, STAVE would be S(✓) T(✓) A(✓) G(x) E(✓) -> then we learn the fourth letter should be K or V? But we only have one more guess? No, we are on guess 3? So we have 4,5,6 left.

So we have room.

Alternatively, there is another word: STANE? N is excluded? So not.

We can also list: 
  STAMPE? Not 5 letters? No.

So STAGE, STAKE, STAVE, STATE (which has two T's) are candidates? But STATE has two T's, and we already know T is in position 2? So if we guess STATE, and the word actually has T in position 4? We already ruled it out? Because the feedback told us T is not in position 4? So the fourth letter cannot be T? Therefore, STATE is not possible? Because if we put T in position 4, we get a dash? But we already know that T is not in position 4? So STATE would have T in both positions? And then for position 4, we'd have T -> dash or something? Actually, in STATE, the fourth letter T would be marked as: since the actual word does not have T in position 4? In our case, we know the word has exactly one T in position 2? So STATE cannot be the secret word? Because STATE has two T's? But we don't know if the secret word has two T's? 

Actually, we know:
  The secret word has at least one T? But possibly more? But the feedback on ""slate"": the T we put in position 4 got a dash? Meaning that T is in the word? But since we've used only one T? And the actual word has at least one T? And that T is not in position 4? Therefore, the T could be in position 2? Or if there is a duplicate T? Then we don't know? But wait, we didn't test position 2? So logically: T must be in position 2? Because there is no other position for it? Positions 1,3,5 are S, A, E? So only position 2? Unless the word has two T's? Then T could be in position 2 and position 4? But we have evidence: when we put T in position 4? We got a dash? That means the secret word has T? But it isn't in position 4? And then we conclude it must be in position 2? But if the word had T in both, then the T we put in position 4 would be a dash? Because it is present but in the wrong position (i.e., position 2)? So yes, we can have a secret word with two T's? But only in positions 2 and 4? But when we put T in position 4, we got a dash? That is consistent with the T actually being in position 2? And not in position 4? But if the T were also in position 4? Then we would have gotten a check for T in position 4? Which we did not? So no, the secret word doesn't have T in position 4? Therefore, if there is a T in position 2, and we didn't test position 2? We don't have direct evidence? But we know T must be in the word? And position 2 is the only place left? So unless there is a duplicate T? But that duplicate would appear elsewhere? Only position 4? Which we already ruled out? Therefore, the second letter must be T? So there is exactly one T? And it is in position 2.

Therefore, the word is S T A ? E.

To confirm: positions 1: S, 2: T, 3: A, 4: ?, 5: E.

And we need the fourth letter which is not C, R, N, L.

So we'll guess ""STAGE"".

<guess>stage</guess>Based on the feedback:
- **Guess 1: crane**: C❌, R❌, A✅ (3rd position), N❌, E✅ (5th position).  
  → Pattern: `_ _ A _ E`  
  → Excluded: C, R, N  
- **Guess 2: slate**: S✅ (1st position), L❌, A✅ (3rd position), T➖ (not in 4th position), E✅ (5th position).  
  → Pattern: `S _ A _ E` (1st letter confirmed as S)  
  → T is *in* the word but not in the 4th position.  
  → Excluded (new): L  
  → **Inference**: The secret word is `S T A _ E` because:  
    - T must be in the word but not in position 4 (from ➖ feedback on T in ""slate"").  
    - Positions 1, 3, and 5 are fixed (S, A, E), leaving position 2 as the only possible spot for T.  
    - Thus, **position 2 must be T** (exactly one T).  

### Summary of known information:
- **Secret pattern**: `S T A _ E`  
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, N, L  
- **Valid positions**:  
  - ✅ 1st: S  
  - ✅ 2nd: T (inferred logically)  
  - ✅ 3rd: A  
  - ❓ 4th: Unknown letter (not C, R, N, L)  
  - ✅ 5th: E  

### Possible words:
Given `S T A _ E`, common English words include:  
- **STAGE** (4th: G)  
- **STAKE** (4th: K)  
- **STAVE** (4th: V)  
- ~~STATE~~ (4th: T, but T can only appear once based on inference) → Invalid.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test a valid word that fits `S T A _ E` to solve for the missing 4th letter.
- Prioritize common letters (e.g., G, K, V) not yet tested.  
- **STAGE** is chosen because:  
  - Uses **G** (new, untested letter).  
  - Common word, maximizing solve chance.  

If correct, the game ends. If incorrect, the feedback on G will reveal if it belongs in the word (e.g., ➖ or x), narrowing the final letter quickly.

No, wait: positions: 1:S, 2:L, 3:A, 4:T, 5:E -> so that\'s valid.\n\nHowever, we must avoid using letters that we know are not in the word. We don\'t know about S, L, T, etc. yet.\n\nBut note: we have two fixed positions (3rd: A, 5th: E). So we can try a word that has different letters in positions 1,2,4.\n\nWe want to maximize the chance of getting more feedback. So we can choose a word that has letters that are common and that we haven\'t tested.\n\nLet me list some words that fit the pattern _ _ A _ E and do not contain C, R, N:\n\n  - SHADE: S, H, D\n  - SHALE: S, H, L\n  - SHAME: S, H, M\n  - SHAPE: S, H, P\n  - STAGE: S, T, G\n  - STALE: S, T, L\n  - STAKE: S, T, K\n  - STAVE: S, T, V\n  - SUAVE: S, U, V -> but U is a vowel, and we already have two vowels? It\'s okay, but maybe less common.\n\nWe also have:\n  - BLAME: B, L, M -> but note: B is a new letter, and we avoid R? We don\'t have R in BLAME. But we have to avoid R? Actually, we know R is not in the word, so we cannot use R. BLAME does not contain R, so it\'s okay.\n\nBut note: we have two fixed letters (A and E) and we know the word must be 5 letters. So we can generate a list.\n\nHowever, we must also consider that the word might have the same letter twice? But without evidence, we assume no duplicates.\n\nI think a good next guess would be one that uses common letters and tests positions 1,2,4.\n\nLet\'s choose ""SLATE"": because it has S, L, T which are common, and we can get feedback on these.\n\nBut wait: in the first guess, we had A and E correct. In ""SLATE"", we have:\n  - S: new\n  - L: new\n  - A: already correct (so we expect a check for A in position 3)\n  - T: new\n  - E: already correct (so we expect a check for E in position 5)\n\nSo the feedback will tell us about S, L, T.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose ""SHADE"" to test S, H, D.\n\nBut I think ""SLATE"" is a very common word and covers three common consonants.\n\nHowever, note that we have already eliminated R, so if we use ""SLATE"", we are testing S, L, T.\n\nBut what if the word is ""SHADE""? Then by guessing ""SLATE"", we might not get as much information about the exact letters? Actually, we will get:\n\n  If the secret word is ""SHADE"":\n    S: in the word? In ""SHADE"", S is the first letter. But in ""SLATE"", S is the first letter -> so if the secret word has S in the first position, we get a check. Otherwise, if it\'s in a different position, we get a dash. If not, we get an x.\n\nBut we don\'t know the secret word.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t have A and E? Actually, we know A and E are in the word, but we already have them in the correct positions. So we can reuse them? Actually, we must, because we have to form a valid 5-letter word.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to reuse letters that we know are in the word? Yes, but we already know A and E are in the word and in the correct positions. So we can use them to form the word.\n\nSo I think ""SLATE"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me check: is ""SLATE"" a valid word? Yes.\n\nSo we\'ll go with ""SLATE"".\n\nBut wait: what about the possibility that the word has a double letter? We don\'t have any indication, so we can ignore for now.\n\nTherefore, our next guess is ""SLATE"".\n\n<guess>slate</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C, R, N** are not in the word (marked ""x"").\n- **A** is correct and in the 3rd position (marked ""✓"").\n- **E** is correct and in the 5th position (marked ""✓"").\n\nThis means the secret word has the pattern: `_ _ A _ E`, and it **excludes C, R, N**. \n\nFor the next guess:\n- I need to test new letters to uncover the missing positions (1, 2, and 4).\n- I chose **""slate""** because:\n  - It fits the pattern `_ _ A _ E` (3rd letter A, 5th letter E).\n  - It uses common consonants (**S, L, T**) that haven\'t been tested yet.\n  - It avoids the eliminated letters (C, R, N).\n  - This maximizes information gain by testing three new letters in key positions.\n\nIf ""slate"" is correct, great! If not, the feedback will reveal which of S, L, or T are in the word and their positions.\n\n<guess>slate</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(-) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from the previous guess ""slate"":\n  S: ✓ (so the first letter of the secret word is S)\n  L: x (L is not in the word)\n  A: ✓ (already known, third letter is A)\n  T: - (T is in the word but not in the fourth position; so T is present elsewhere)\n  E: ✓ (already known, fifth letter is E)\n\nTherefore, we know:\n  The secret word is S _ A _ E\n  The first letter is S, third is A, fifth is E.\n  Letters L is not in the word.\n  T is in the word, but not in the fourth position. Since positions 1,3,5 are fixed (S, A, E), T must be in position 2 or 4. But the feedback shows that T was in the fourth position of our guess and got a dash, meaning it\'s present but not there. Wait, let me interpret:\n\nIn ""slate"", we placed T in the fourth position and got a dash (-), meaning that T is in the word but not in the fourth position. Therefore, T must be in position 2 (since position 1 is S, 3 is A, 5 is E). So the only possibility is that the second letter is T? Not necessarily, because the word might have T in the second position, but note we haven\'t fixed position 2 yet.\n\nActually, the secret word has T, but not in position 4. Since our guess had T in position 4 and it was wrong, T must be in position 2 (the only remaining spot) or if the word has two T\'s? But we don\'t know that.\n\nBut note: our first guess ""crane"" had T? No, ""crane"" had C, R, A, N, E. And R and N are not in the word, so no T in the first guess.\n\nTherefore, T is a new letter and must be in the word. The possible positions for T are 2 or 4. But from the feedback of ""slate"", T was placed in position 4 and we got a dash, meaning that position 4 is not T, so T must be in position 2.\n\nTherefore, now we know the secret word is S T A _ E? Or is that necessarily?\n\nLet me explain: the dash (-) for T means that T is in the word but not in the position we guessed. We guessed T in position 4. Therefore, T cannot be in position 4, but it must be in the word. The only other unknown position is position 2 (since 1,3,5 are fixed). Therefore, we can conclude that the second letter must be T.\n\nTherefore, the word is S T A _ E.\n\nNow, we need to find the fourth letter. We know the word is S T A _ E.\n\nWe also know from previous feedback:\n  Excluded letters: C, R, N, L (from the first and second guesses).\n    - First guess: C, R, N are out.\n    - Second guess: L is out (marked x).\n\nSo we must avoid C, R, N, L.\n\nWhat letters could the fourth letter be? We have to avoid these and any other letters we might have tested? Only S, T, A, E are known to be in the word, but S, T, A, E are fixed in their positions.\n\nNow, for the fourth letter, we can choose any letter that hasn\'t been excluded and forms a valid English word.\n\nWe need a word of the form S T A ? E.\n\nLet me think of words with that pattern:\n  - STAGE: S T A G E\n  - STARE: but R is excluded (from first guess: R is x), so it can\'t be STARE.\n  - STALE: but L is excluded (second guess: L is x), so not STALE.\n  - STAKE: S T A K E\n  - STAVE: S T A V E\n  - STATE: S T A T E -> but T is repeated? And we haven\'t seen a double letter yet. But we don\'t know if doubles are allowed. However, note we have T already in position 2. In STATE, the fourth letter is T, so that would be two T\'s? But we must consider.\n\nBut we must avoid R and L. Also, N and C are out.\n\nSo possible words: STAGE, STAKE, STAVE, STATE, etc.\n\nWe haven\'t tested G, K, V, etc.\n\nWe also need to consider that we have no clues about the fourth letter. So we want to guess a word that might be it, or at least test new letters.\n\nBut note: if we guess a word, we are making a guess for the entire word. So we can guess one of these words.\n\nWe have 6 tries total, and we\'re on guess 3.\n\nSo we can guess, say, ""STAGE"". Why not ""STAKE"" or ""STAVE""?\n\nBut let\'s consider what we have tested:\n\nKnown in word: S, T (we inferred), A, E.\n\nKnown not in word: C, R, N, L.\n\nWe haven\'t tested many other letters.\n\nBut note: in STA? E, the fourth letter is the only missing part.\n\nSo we can list possible letters for the fourth spot.\n\nPossible letters that are not excluded: A to Z except C, R, N, L. But also, excluding letters that cannot form words? We must form a valid word.\n\nLet me list some words with S T A _ E:\n\n  - STAGE: G\n  - STAKE: K\n  - STAVE: V\n  - STATE: T (double T)\n  - STANE: but N is excluded, so not STANE.\n  - STAPE: P? Is ""STAPE"" a word? I think not common; not common in everyday use. Perhaps not valid.\n  - STARE: R excluded.\n  - STALE: L excluded.\n\nOther possibilities: \n  - STAGE, STAKE, STAVE, STATE are the common ones.\n\nWe have to choose one of these. But we don\'t know which one.\n\nWe can still get information if we guess a word that has a new letter? But since we\'re guessing the entire word, if we guess correctly we win, else we get feedback on the fourth letter.\n\nBut note: we are not required to maximize information in this guess because we are almost there. We have four letters known: S, T, A, E are known, and only one letter missing? Actually, we don\'t have T confirmed by direct evidence? But we inferred by logic.\n\nWait, let me double-check the feedback:\n\nFeedback of ""slate"": \n  S was first -> correct, so first letter is S.\n  L was second -> not in word.\n  A was third -> correct.\n  T was fourth -> present but not in fourth position? Since T must be in the word and not in fourth, and the only open position is second? So second must be T? Unless there is another position? Only positions 2 and 4 were unknown, but position 4 we tried T and it was present but not there, so it must be in position 2? And we didn\'t have T in any other position? So yes, position 2 must be T.\n\nTherefore, the word must be S T A ? E.\n\nSo we can guess STAGE, for example.\n\nBut we want to make sure we don\'t waste a guess? There are limited tries.\n\nWe can choose one that tests a letter we haven\'t tried? But all letters except the fixed ones are new? Actually, in STAGE, G is new. So if it\'s not correct, we learn that G is or isn\'t in the word? But if we guess STAGE and the fourth letter is not G, then the feedback will show:\n\n  If the fourth letter is not G, then:\n    We get: S(✓), T(✓), A(✓), G(if it\'s not the correct letter: might be x if not in word, or dash if in word but wrong position? But the word only has five letters, so G can only be in fourth? Actually, the feedback will tell us about G.\n\nBut note: since we know the word is S T A _ E, we can also consider not knowing the fourth letter, so we can guess a word that uses a new letter for the fourth position.\n\nAlternatively, we can guess ""STATE"". Why? Because we know T is in the word, so we can test if there\'s a double T? But note, we have T in position 2, and then we put T in position 4. If the secret word does not have T in position 4, we get a dash for T? Or if there\'s no T repeated, then it would be marked as not present? But we already know T is in the word? Actually, if there is no second T, then putting T in position 4 would be marked as dash? No, because if we put a letter that is in the word but not in that position, we get a dash. So even if the word has only one T, and we put a T in a wrong position (like the fourth when the T is actually in the second), we get a dash for the extra T? Only the first occurrence? Actually, Wordle\'s rule: it would mark the extra T as x? No, because only one T exists. However, the rules of this game state: ""dash"" means the letter is in the word but in the wrong position.\n\nIn ""STATE"" if the word is STAGE: \n  S: ✓ (position 1)\n  T: ✓ (position 2) -> because the T is in the word? But we placed T in position 2? Yes, and it\'s correct. So for the T in position 2, we get ✓.\n  A: ✓ (position 3)\n  T: we placed a second T in position 4. The actual word STAGE has no T in any other position? Only one T (in position 2). Therefore, the fourth T should be marked x? Because T is already used? Or since the T was already used in position 2, the second T would be considered absent? \n\nAccording to the game rules: each feedback is per letter, considering whether that specific letter is present and not accounted for? But the standard Wordle rules: after accounting for the correct positions, you then mark letters in wrong positions for the remaining ones? So for STATE vs STAGE:\n  Position 1: S matches -> ✓\n  Position 2: T matches -> ✓ (so we\'ve used one T from the actual word)\n  Position 3: A matches -> ✓\n  Position 4: T in guess, but the actual word STAGE has no T left? So T would be x.\n  Position 5: E matches -> ✓\n\nSo feedback would be: S(✓) T(✓) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)\n\nTherefore, we learn that T is not repeated? But we already know? So that wouldn\'t help?\n\nI think it\'s better to avoid guessing STATE? Because it uses T again, wasting a guess? We can choose a word with a new letter.\n\nTherefore, we can guess STAGE, which gives:\n  If the secret word is STAGE, we win.\n  If not, for example, if the word is STAKE, we get:\n     S(✓) T(✓) A(✓) G(x) E(✓) -> and then we know G is not in the word? Actually, G is shown as x because it\'s not in the word? Then we can try STAKE next? But that uses K.\n\nSimilarly, STAVE would give similar.\n\nWe have 6 guesses, so we can try one by one? But we might be smarter.\n\nAlternatively, we can guess a word that is not of the pattern but contains multiple possibilities? But no, because we already know the pattern is S T A _ E.\n\nSo we must guess S T A ? E.\n\nWe can choose one that uses a letter not yet tested? For example, STAKE? But we don\'t care because we\'re identifying the letter? Actually, when we guess a word that completes the pattern, we either win or we get a miss on the fourth letter? So we learn whether that particular letter is correct.\n\nBut we can only learn about that specific letter? Yes.\n\nSo we\'ll guess ""STAGE"" because it\'s a common word.\n\nBut let me check: STAKE, STAGE, STAVE and STATE are options.\n\nSince we have no information, we might choose arbitrarily? Or we can choose one that tests a common letter.\n\nBut commonality: G and K are common? It\'s hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, we can notice that in our second guess we had T in the fourth position? No, we used T in the fourth position? But we learned T is not there? So we know T must be the second letter? But we didn\'t confirm the second letter? How? \n\nWait: we didn\'t test the second letter directly? In the second guess ""slate"", we placed L in the second position? And we got L(x). So we don\'t know what the second letter is? We inferred that T must be in position 2 because it wasn\'t in position 4? But T is present in the word? And positions 1,3,5 are known? And position 4 would have been the other place? Therefore, the second letter must be T? Or could there be a double letter? For example, if the word has T in the second and fourth? But we placed T in the fourth and got a dash? That means T is present but not in the fourth position? So it could be only in the second position? If it were in both, then we should have gotten at least a dash for the fourth? But wait: when we put T in the fourth, if there is a T in the fourth in the actual word, we would get a check? We got a dash? Meaning it\'s present but not there? So if there were two T\'s, and one is already in the second? But the dash only says that T is present? And then if we had an extra T? Then the dash wouldn\'t necessarily tell us about duplication? Actually, in the rules, the feedback doesn\'t indicate duplicates specifically? But it marks each letter individually? \n\nTherefore, we must consider that T might appear twice? But then, if the secret word had two T\'s, and we put a T in the fourth position? Even if there is a T in the fourth position, we would have gotten ✓, but we got dash? So no, that implies there is no T in the fourth position? So there is exactly one T? And it must be in position 2? \n\nTherefore, our inference that the word is S T A ? E is sound.\n\nSo we proceed to guess the word by filling the fourth position.\n\nWe can choose ""STAGE"" because:\n  It uses G, which we haven\'t seen before? We haven\'t tested G? Yes.\n  And ""STAGE"" is a common word.\n\nTherefore, we guess ""STAGE"".\n\nIf it\'s wrong, we\'ll get feedback: \n  If the secret word is STAKE, we get: \n    S(✓), T(✓), A(✓), G(x), E(✓) -> meaning G is not in the word? Then we know to try STAKE?\n  Similarly, STAVE would be S(✓) T(✓) A(✓) G(x) E(✓) -> then we learn the fourth letter should be K or V? But we only have one more guess? No, we are on guess 3? So we have 4,5,6 left.\n\nSo we have room.\n\nAlternatively, there is another word: STANE? N is excluded? So not.\n\nWe can also list: \n  STAMPE? Not 5 letters? No.\n\nSo STAGE, STAKE, STAVE, STATE (which has two T\'s) are candidates? But STATE has two T\'s, and we already know T is in position 2? So if we guess STATE, and the word actually has T in position 4? We already ruled it out? Because the feedback told us T is not in position 4? So the fourth letter cannot be T? Therefore, STATE is not possible? Because if we put T in position 4, we get a dash? But we already know that T is not in position 4? So STATE would have T in both positions? And then for position 4, we\'d have T -> dash or something? Actually, in STATE, the fourth letter T would be marked as: since the actual word does not have T in position 4? In our case, we know the word has exactly one T in position 2? So STATE cannot be the secret word? Because STATE has two T\'s? But we don\'t know if the secret word has two T\'s? \n\nActually, we know:\n  The secret word has at least one T? But possibly more? But the feedback on ""slate"": the T we put in position 4 got a dash? Meaning that T is in the word? But since we\'ve used only one T? And the actual word has at least one T? And that T is not in position 4? Therefore, the T could be in position 2? Or if there is a duplicate T? Then we don\'t know? But wait, we didn\'t test position 2? So logically: T must be in position 2? Because there is no other position for it? Positions 1,3,5 are S, A, E? So only position 2? Unless the word has two T\'s? Then T could be in position 2 and position 4? But we have evidence: when we put T in position 4? We got a dash? That means the secret word has T? But it isn\'t in position 4? And then we conclude it must be in position 2? But if the word had T in both, then the T we put in position 4 would be a dash? Because it is present but in the wrong position (i.e., position 2)? So yes, we can have a secret word with two T\'s? But only in positions 2 and 4? But when we put T in position 4, we got a dash? That is consistent with the T actually being in position 2? And not in position 4? But if the T were also in position 4? Then we would have gotten a check for T in position 4? Which we did not? So no, the secret word doesn\'t have T in position 4? Therefore, if there is a T in position 2, and we didn\'t test position 2? We don\'t have direct evidence? But we know T must be in the word? And position 2 is the only place left? So unless there is a duplicate T? But that duplicate would appear elsewhere? Only position 4? Which we already ruled out? Therefore, the second letter must be T? So there is exactly one T? And it is in position 2.\n\nTherefore, the word is S T A ? E.\n\nTo confirm: positions 1: S, 2: T, 3: A, 4: ?, 5: E.\n\nAnd we need the fourth letter which is not C, R, N, L.\n\nSo we\'ll guess ""STAGE"".\n\n<guess>stage</guess>Based on the feedback:\n- **Guess 1: crane**: C❌, R❌, A✅ (3rd position), N❌, E✅ (5th position).  \n  → Pattern: `_ _ A _ E`  \n  → Excluded: C, R, N  \n- **Guess 2: slate**: S✅ (1st position), L❌, A✅ (3rd position), T➖ (not in 4th position), E✅ (5th position).  \n  → Pattern: `S _ A _ E` (1st letter confirmed as S)  \n  → T is *in* the word but not in the 4th position.  \n  → Excluded (new): L  \n  → **Inference**: The secret word is `S T A _ E` because:  \n    - T must be in the word but not in position 4 (from ➖ feedback on T in ""slate"").  \n    - Positions 1, 3, and 5 are fixed (S, A, E), leaving position 2 as the only possible spot for T.  \n    - Thus, **position 2 must be T** (exactly one T).  \n\n### Summary of known information:\n- **Secret pattern**: `S T A _ E`  \n- **Excluded letters**: C, R, N, L  \n- **Valid positions**:  \n  - ✅ 1st: S  \n  - ✅ 2nd: T (inferred logically)  \n  - ✅ 3rd: A  \n  - ❓ 4th: Unknown letter (not C, R, N, L)  \n  - ✅ 5th: E  \n\n### Possible words:\nGiven `S T A _ E`, common English words include:  \n- **STAGE** (4th: G)  \n- **STAKE** (4th: K)  \n- **STAVE** (4th: V)  \n- ~~STATE~~ (4th: T, but T can only appear once based on inference) → Invalid.  \n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- Test a valid word that fits `S T A _ E` to solve for the missing 4th letter.\n- Prioritize common letters (e.g., G, K, V) not yet tested.  \n- **STAGE** is chosen because:  \n  - Uses **G** (new, untested letter).  \n  - Common word, maximizing solve chance.  \n\nIf correct, the game ends.

  - Excluded: L  
- **Guess 3 (stage)**:  
  - S✅, T✅ (confirms position 2), A✅, E✅ → Pattern: `S T A _ E`  
  - G❌ → Excluded: G  

### Current Knowledge:
- **Secret pattern**: `S T A _ E`  
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, N, L, G  
- **4th position candidates**: Must be a valid English letter (not excluded) that forms a real word.  
  - Common options: **K** (STAKE), **V** (STAVE)  

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Test **STAKE** (4th: K):  
  - If correct, game ends.  
  - If incorrect, feedback on K will confirm if it’s in the word (➖) or absent (❌), leaving **STAVE** as the only common solution.",Guess 4: stake -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) A(✓) K(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
