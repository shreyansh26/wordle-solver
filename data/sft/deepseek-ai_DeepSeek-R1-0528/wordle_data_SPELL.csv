We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has common letters: we want at least two vowels and some frequent consonants.
 The word ""ROAST"" is a good candidate because:
   - It contains 'R', 'O', 'A', 'S', 'T' — all common letters.
   - It has two vowels ('O' and 'A') and three consonants.

 Alternatively, we can consider ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"". But let's go with ""ROAST"" for now.

 However, note that the example in the rules used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", so we might avoid repeating those.

 Another popular choice is ""ADIEU"" because it has many vowels, but it has only one common consonant. We want to maximize information.

 I think ""CRANE"" is a very good starting word because:
   - It has three consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).
   - The letters C, R, A, N, E are all fairly common.

 But let me check: the word ""CRANE"" is valid.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also a strong starter.

 Since we are at the first guess, any of these is fine. I'll go with ""CRANE"".

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".
</think>
I need to make the first guess in this Wordle-like game. Since there's no prior feedback, I should choose a starting word that maximizes information gain. A good starter typically includes common vowels and consonants to cover frequent letters in 5-letter words. 

I'll select ""CRANE"" because:
- It contains three vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (C, R, N)
- The letters C, R, A, N, E appear frequently in English words
- It avoids repeating letters, allowing broader coverage
- It's a balanced word that often reveals useful positional clues

This choice should help narrow down possibilities efficiently based on the feedback symbols (✓, -, x) I receive.

We are on the second guess. Previous feedback for ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-). 
 This means:
  - 'E' is in the secret word but not in the fifth position (since it got ""-"", meaning it's present but in the wrong position).
  - C, R, A, N are NOT in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter 'E' but not in the last position. Also, the word does not contain C, R, A, or N.

 Since we have eliminated C, R, A, N, we must avoid using them.

 The letter 'E' must be in one of the first four positions? Actually, no: the feedback ""-"" for E just means it is in the word but not in the 5th position. It could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 Our next guess should include the letter 'E' (since we know it is in the word) and avoid C, R, A, N.

 We should also try to cover other common letters to get more information.

 Common letters in 5-letter words (excluding C,R,A,N): E, S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.

 Since we have only one known letter 'E', let's try to choose a word that has 'E' and other common letters not tried yet.

 Possibilities: words like ""SPITE"", ""TIMES"", ""STOLE"", ""HOUSE"", etc. But note: we must avoid the letters C, R, A, N.

 Important: the word must have 'E', and we should place 'E' in a position that is not the fifth (since we know it's not at the end). But also, since we don't know the position of E yet, we can try putting it in a different position than last time.

 In ""crane"", E was in position 5. So in the next guess, we can try E in positions 1,2,3, or 4.

 Let's consider a word with E in the middle or beginning to try to locate its position.

 Example: ""SPITE"" has E at the end? No, that's position 5 again. But we know E is not at position 5? Actually, no: the feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5, so we cannot put E at position 5 in our next guess? Actually, we can, but it would be a wasted opportunity because we already know it's not there. Alternatively, we can try to put E in a new position to test.

 However, note that the feedback symbol for E was ""-"" meaning that E is present but not in position 5. So if we put E in another position and we get ✓, then we know it's correct. If we get ""-"" again, then we know that position is also wrong. If we get ""x"" when putting E in another position? That would be impossible because we know E is in the word.

 So we definitely want to include E, but not in position 5.

 Let's pick a word that has E in position 1,2,3, or 4 and uses other common letters.

 Some candidate words:
 - ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> E in position 5? No, we want to avoid position 5. Also, position 5 is bad because we already know E is not there.
   Actually, in ""STOLE"", E is in position 5. So we avoid that.

 - ""HOUSE"": E in position 5 -> avoid.

 - ""TIMES"": E in position 5 -> avoid.

 - ""STEEP"": E in position 5 -> avoid.

 - ""THIEF"": E in position 4 -> this is good (positions: 1-T, 2-H, 3-I, 4-E, 5-F). But note: we must avoid C,R,A,N. THIEF: T, H, I, E, F. None of C,R,A,N. So it's acceptable.

 However, is ""THIEF"" a valid word? Yes.

 But let's think: another word might be ""QUITE"", but it has E at the end? No, ""QUITE"" -> Q-U-I-T-E, so E is at position 5.

 Alternatively, ""FIELD"": F-I-E-L-D -> E at position 3. So that's acceptable. But let's check letters: F, I, E, L, D. Avoids C,R,A,N.

 Another option: ""BELOW"": B-E-L-O-W -> E at position 2. Avoids C,R,A,N.

 But we want to maximize the number of new common letters. Let's consider frequency.

 After vowels, common consonants: S, T, L, D, M, etc.

 Considering words with E and without C,R,A,N:

 Possible words: 
   ""BONES"" -> but N is eliminated? We know N is not in the word. Feedback was N(x) so no. So we cannot use N either.
   Similarly, we cannot use C,R,A,N.

 So we must avoid C,R,A,N in the new word.

 List of available letters: 
   We know E is in the word, and we don't know 4 other letters. We must choose from the remaining alphabet without C,R,A,N.

 We can try to use S, T, L, O, I, D, H, etc.

 Let me try to find a word that has E and common letters, and avoid C,R,A,N and also avoid other less common letters.

 One example: ""STOLE"" is invalid because it has E at the end? And also we can't use that because of position? We can't use E at the end? Actually we can, but it would be bad strategy because we already know E isn't there. So we avoid position 5 for E.

 ""STEEL"" -> E at positions 3 and 4? Actually:

   Position: S(1), T(2), E(3), E(4), L(5) -> but L(5) is okay? But E in position 3 and 4. However, the word has two E's? We don't know if the word has duplicate E. But that is a possibility.

 But note: in the first guess ""crane"", E got a ""-"", meaning the word has at least one E. It might have more.

 But let me think: the word ""STEEL"" has E in position 3 and 4. But we know E is not at position 5? Position 5 is L. 

 However, we want to test E in a different position? So we can try E at position 1, for instance? How about ""ELBOW""? But O in position 4? And W at the end? Actually, ""ELBOW"": E at position 1.

 But we need a 5-letter word: ""ELBOW"" is 5 letters.

 But let's consider: 
   ""ELBOW"": E, L, B, O, W -> no C,R,A,N. We don't know if L, B, O, W are in the word? But we can try.

 However, we can also try to cover more frequent letters: T and S are very common.

 How about ""STYLE"": S, T, Y, L, E -> E is at position 5? No, position 5: E -> that's the same issue.

 How about ""LOPES"": O, E -> but E at position 5? 
   ""SPIEL"": S, P, I, E, L -> E at position 4? This works.

 Is ""SPIEL"" valid? Yes, it's a word meaning a long or important game in sports (or a form of gambling).

 Alternative: ""POISE"": P, O, I, S, E -> E at position 5 -> avoid.

 Another: ""OWLET"": O, W, L, E, T -> E at position 4 -> acceptable.

 But note: in the first guess, all positions except E were wrong. So the word does not have C, R, A, N.

 We have to make a guess that includes E and avoids C, R, A, N.

 After some thought, let me pick ""THIEF"": T, H, I, E, F -> E at position 4.

 Why ""THIEF""? 
   - It has E in position 4 (testing a new position)
   - It uses T, H, I, F: all common letters.

 Alternatively, we could choose ""SLEEP"": S, L, E, E, P -> E in positions 3 and 4? That's two E's? We don't know if duplicate letters are allowed? The rules don't say duplicates are forbidden, but the secret word might have duplicates? Actually, Wordle sometimes has duplicate letters? The rules didn't specify.

 Given our feedback: only one E was shown in the first guess? But we don't know if there are duplicates. The feedback for ""crane"" showed E as present but wrong position. That doesn't rule out duplicates.

 In ""THIEF"", we are testing E at position 4. Also, we are testing T, H, I, F.

 Alternatively, we can choose ""SHINE"": S, H, I, N, E -> but wait, we cannot use N? Because N was eliminated? In the first feedback, N was marked ""x"", meaning no N in the word. So we cannot use N.

 Therefore, ""SHINE"" is invalid.

 Similarly, ""THINE"" has N -> invalid.

 So ""THIEF"" seems good.

 Another candidate: ""MOVIE"": M, O, V, I, E -> E at position 5 -> avoid.

 ""PIXIE"": P, I, X, I, E -> E at position 5? avoid.

 ""DOGES"": D, O, G, E, S -> E at position 4? This works. Letters: D, O, G, E, S -> no C,R,A,N.

 But G is less common? Maybe we can do better.

 Let's pick ""STOLE"" if we put E in position 5? But that would be bad because we know E is not at position 5. So we avoid that.

 Another: ""STEEL"" has E in positions 3 and 4? And S and T? But S and T are common. Then let me consider ""STEEL"". But that would use two E's? It's acceptable? And we already avoided C,R,A,N? Yes.

 But I prefer a word without duplicates if possible? Because duplicates are less common? And we can get more information if we try five distinct letters? But THIEF doesn't have duplicates? Yes, THIEF is distinct.

 Alternatively, ""SLEEK"" -> E at positions 3 and 4? But then we are testing E in two positions? 

 Considering efficiency, I think ""THIEF"" is a good choice.

 Another word: ""OILED"": O, I, L, E, D -> E at position 4. Avoids C,R,A,N. Distinct letters.

 Or ""FIELD"": F, I, E, L, D -> E at position 3.

 Why FIELD? E at position 3.

 However, in the first word ""crane"", E was at position 5 and that was wrong. Now putting E at position 3? We are testing in a different position.

 Actually, we don't know where E is, so any position (1-4) is possible.

 I think we'll go with ""THIEF"".

 Steps:
   We include E and put it at position 4.
   We avoid C,R,A,N.
   We choose T, H, I, F: common letters.

 Let me check: T is very common, H common, I common vowel, F less common but acceptable.

 If I'm concerned about F, we might choose a word with L or S? But ""THIEF"" has S? No, it has T, H, I, E, F.

 Another word: ""WHITE"": W, H, I, T, E -> E at position 5 -> avoid.

 ""SHITE"" -> invalid? Or vulgar? Avoid. 

 ""POSSE"" -> E at the end? Avoid.

 ""BREAD"" -> has R and A? Eliminated.

 So ""THIEF"" is acceptable.

 Therefore, my second guess is ""THIEF"". 

 Important: the response format must be <guess>thief</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- ✓: None (no correct positions)
- -: E (present but not in position 5)
- x: C, R, A, N (not in the word at all)

Key deductions:
1. The secret word contains ""E"" but not in the last position (positions 1–4 possible).
2. Letters C, R, A, N are eliminated entirely.
3. The next guess must:
   - Include ""E"" in positions 1–4.
   - Avoid C, R, A, N.
   - Use new common letters to maximize information (e.g., S, T, L, O, I, D).

Selected guess: **""thief""**  
- Places ""E"" in position 4 (testing a new position).
- Uses common letters: T, H, I, F (all untested).
- Valid 5-letter word avoiding eliminated letters.

<guess>thief</guess>",thief,"We are on the second guess. Previous feedback for ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-). 
 This means:
  - 'E' is in the secret word but not in the fifth position (since it got ""-"", meaning it's present but in the wrong position).
  - C, R, A, N are NOT in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter 'E' but not in the last position. Also, the word does not contain C, R, A, or N.

 Since we have eliminated C, R, A, N, we must avoid using them.

 The letter 'E' must be in one of the first four positions? Actually, no: the feedback ""-"" for E just means it is in the word but not in the 5th position. It could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 In ""crane"", E was in position 5. So in the next guess, we can try E in positions 1,2,3, or 4.

 Let's consider a word with E in the middle or beginning to try to locate its position.

 Example: ""SPITE"" has E at the end? No, that's position 5 again. But we know E is not at position 5? Actually, no: the feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5, so we cannot put E at position 5 in our next guess? Actually, we can, but it would be a wasted opportunity because we already know it's not there. Alternatively, we can try to put E in a new position to test.

 However, note that the feedback symbol for E was ""-"" meaning that E is present but not in position 5. So if we put E in another position and we get ✓, then we know it's correct. If we get ""-"" again, then we know that position is also wrong. If we get ""x"" when putting E in another position? That would be impossible because we know E is in the word.

 So we definitely want to include E, but not in position 5.

 Let's pick a word that has E in position 1,2,3, or 4 and uses other common letters.

 Some candidate words:
 - ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> E in position 5? No, we want to avoid position 5. Also, position 5 is bad because we already know E is not there.
   Actually, in ""STOLE"", E is in position 5. So we avoid that.

 - ""HOUSE"": E in position 5 -> avoid.

 - ""TIMES"": E in position 5 -> avoid.

 - ""STEEP"": E in position 5 -> avoid.

 - ""THIEF"": E in position 4 -> this is good (positions: 1-T, 2-H, 3-I, 4-E, 5-F). But note: we must avoid C,R,A,N. THIEF: T, H, I, E, F. None of C,R,A,N. So it's acceptable.

 However, is ""THIEF"" a valid word? Yes.

 But let's think: another word might be ""QUITE"", but it has E at the end? No, ""QUITE"" -> Q-U-I-T-E, so E is at position 5.

 Alternatively, ""FIELD"": F-I-E-L-D -> E at position 3. So that's acceptable. But let's check letters: F, I, E, L, D. Avoids C,R,A,N.

 Another option: ""BELOW"": B-E-L-O-W -> E at position 2. Avoids C,R,A,N.

 But we want to maximize the number of new common letters. Let's consider frequency.

 After vowels, common consonants: S, T, L, D, M, etc.

 Considering words with E and without C,R,A,N:

 Possible words: 
   ""BONES"" -> but N is eliminated? We know N is not in the word. Feedback was N(x) so no. So we cannot use N either.
   Similarly, we cannot use C,R,A,N.

 So we must avoid C,R,A,N in the new word.

   We know E is in the word, and we don't know 4 other letters. We must choose from the remaining alphabet without C,R,A,N.

 We can try to use S, T, L, O, I, D, H, etc.

 Let me try to find a word that has E and common letters, and avoid C,R,A,N and also avoid other less common letters.

 One example: ""STOLE"" is invalid because it has E at the end? And also we can't use that because of position? We can't use E at the end? Actually we can, but it would be bad strategy because we already know E isn't there. So we avoid position 5 for E.

 ""STEEL"" -> E at positions 3 and 4? Actually:

   Position: S(1), T(2), E(3), E(4), L(5) -> but L(5) is okay? But E in position 3 and 4. However, the word has two E's? We don't know if the word has duplicate E. But that is a possibility.

 But note: in the first guess ""crane"", E got a ""-"", meaning the word has at least one E. It might have more.

 But let me think: the word ""STEEL"" has E in position 3 and 4. But we know E is not at position 5? Position 5 is L. 

 However, we want to test E in a different position? So we can try E at position 1, for instance? How about ""ELBOW""? But O in position 4? And W at the end? Actually, ""ELBOW"": E at position 1.

 But we need a 5-letter word: ""ELBOW"" is 5 letters.

 But let's consider: 
   ""ELBOW"": E, L, B, O, W -> no C,R,A,N. We don't know if L, B, O, W are in the word? But we can try.

 However, we can also try to cover more frequent letters: T and S are very common.

 How about ""STYLE"": S, T, Y, L, E -> E is at position 5? No, position 5: E -> that's the same issue.

 How about ""LOPES"": O, E -> but E at position 5? 
   ""SPIEL"": S, P, I, E, L -> E at position 4? This works.

 Is ""SPIEL"" valid? Yes, it's a word meaning a long or important game in sports (or a form of gambling).

 Alternative: ""POISE"": P, O, I, S, E -> E at position 5 -> avoid.

 Another: ""OWLET"": O, W, L, E, T -> E at position 4 -> acceptable.

 But note: in the first guess, all positions except E were wrong. So the word does not have C, R, A, N.

 We have to make a guess that includes E and avoids C, R, A, N.

 After some thought, let me pick ""THIEF"": T, H, I, E, F -> E at position 4.

 Why ""THIEF""? 
   - It has E in position 4 (testing a new position)
   - It uses T, H, I, F: all common letters.

 Alternatively, we could choose ""SLEEP"": S, L, E, E, P -> E in positions 3 and 4? That's two E's? We don't know if duplicate letters are allowed? The rules don't say duplicates are forbidden, but the secret word might have duplicates? Actually, Wordle sometimes has duplicate letters? The rules didn't specify.

 Given our feedback: only one E was shown in the first guess? But we don't know if there are duplicates. The feedback for ""crane"" showed E as present but wrong position. That doesn't rule out duplicates.

 In ""THIEF"", we are testing E at position 4. Also, we are testing T, H, I, F.

 Alternatively, we can choose ""SHINE"": S, H, I, N, E -> but wait, we cannot use N? Because N was eliminated? In the first feedback, N was marked ""x"", meaning no N in the word. So we cannot use N.

 Therefore, ""SHINE"" is invalid.

 Similarly, ""THINE"" has N -> invalid.

 So ""THIEF"" seems good.

 Another candidate: ""MOVIE"": M, O, V, I, E -> E at position 5 -> avoid.

 ""PIXIE"": P, I, X, I, E -> E at position 5? avoid.

 ""DOGES"": D, O, G, E, S -> E at position 4? This works. Letters: D, O, G, E, S -> no C,R,A,N.

 But G is less common? Maybe we can do better.

 Let's pick ""STOLE"" if we put E in position 5? But that would be bad because we know E is not at position 5. So we avoid that.

 Another: ""STEEL"" has E in positions 3 and 4? And S and T? But S and T are common. Then let me consider ""STEEL"". But that would use two E's? It's acceptable? And we already avoided C,R,A,N? Yes.

 But I prefer a word without duplicates if possible? Because duplicates are less common? And we can get more information if we try five distinct letters? But THIEF doesn't have duplicates? Yes, THIEF is distinct.

 Alternatively, ""SLEEK"" -> E at positions 3 and 4? But then we are testing E in two positions? 

 Considering efficiency, I think ""THIEF"" is a good choice.

 Another word: ""OILED"": O, I, L, E, D -> E at position 4. Avoids C,R,A,N. Distinct letters.

 Or ""FIELD"": F, I, E, L, D -> E at position 3.

 Why FIELD? E at position 3.

 However, in the first word ""crane"", E was at position 5 and that was wrong. Now putting E at position 3? We are testing in a different position.

 Actually, we don't know where E is, so any position (1-4) is possible.

 I think we'll go with ""THIEF"".

 Steps:
   We include E and put it at position 4.
   We avoid C,R,A,N.
   We choose T, H, I, F: common letters.

 Let me check: T is very common, H common, I common vowel, F less common but acceptable.

 If I'm concerned about F, we might choose a word with L or S? But ""THIEF"" has S? No, it has T, H, I, E, F.

 Another word: ""WHITE"": W, H, I, T, E -> E at position 5 -> avoid.

 ""SHITE"" -> invalid? Or vulgar? Avoid. 

 ""POSSE"" -> E at the end? Avoid.

 ""BREAD"" -> has R and A? Eliminated.

 So ""THIEF"" is acceptable.

 Therefore, my second guess is ""THIEF"". 

 Important: the response format must be <guess>thief</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- ✓: None (no correct positions)
- -: E (present but not in position 5)
- x: C, R, A, N (not in the word at all)

Key deductions:
1. The secret word contains ""E"" but not in the last position (positions 1–4 possible).
2. Letters C, R, A, N are eliminated entirely.
3. The next guess must:
   - Include ""E"" in positions 1–4.
   - Avoid C, R, A, N.
   - Use new common letters to maximize information (e.g., S, T, L, O, I, D).

Selected guess: **""thief""**

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has common letters: we want at least two vowels and some frequent consonants.
 The word ""ROAST"" is a good candidate because:
   - It contains 'R', 'O', 'A', 'S', 'T' — all common letters.
   - It has two vowels ('O' and 'A') and three consonants.

 Alternatively, we can consider ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"". But let's go with ""ROAST"" for now.

 However, note that the example in the rules used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", so we might avoid repeating those.

 Another popular choice is ""ADIEU"" because it has many vowels, but it has only one common consonant. We want to maximize information.

 I think ""CRANE"" is a very good starting word because:
   - It has three consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).
   - The letters C, R, A, N, E are all fairly common.

 But let me check: the word ""CRANE"" is valid.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also a strong starter.

 Since we are at the first guess, any of these is fine. I'll go with ""CRANE"".

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".I need to make the first guess in this Wordle-like game. Since there's no prior feedback, I should choose a starting word that maximizes information gain. A good starter typically includes common vowels and consonants to cover frequent letters in 5-letter words. 

I'll select ""CRANE"" because:
- It contains three vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (C, R, N)
- The letters C, R, A, N, E appear frequently in English words
- It avoids repeating letters, allowing broader coverage
- It's a balanced word that often reveals useful positional clues

This choice should help narrow down possibilities efficiently based on the feedback symbols (✓, -, x) I receive.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are on the second guess. Previous feedback for ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-). 
 This means:
  - 'E' is in the secret word but not in the fifth position (since it got ""-"", meaning it's present but in the wrong position).
  - C, R, A, N are NOT in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter 'E' but not in the last position. Also, the word does not contain C, R, A, or N.

 Since we have eliminated C, R, A, N, we must avoid using them.

 The letter 'E' must be in one of the first four positions? Actually, no: the feedback ""-"" for E just means it is in the word but not in the 5th position. It could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 Our next guess should include the letter 'E' (since we know it is in the word) and avoid C, R, A, N.

 We should also try to cover other common letters to get more information.

 Common letters in 5-letter words (excluding C,R,A,N): E, S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.

 Since we have only one known letter 'E', let's try to choose a word that has 'E' and other common letters not tried yet.

 Possibilities: words like ""SPITE"", ""TIMES"", ""STOLE"", ""HOUSE"", etc. But note: we must avoid the letters C, R, A, N.

 Important: the word must have 'E', and we should place 'E' in a position that is not the fifth (since we know it's not at the end). But also, since we don't know the position of E yet, we can try putting it in a different position than last time.

 In ""crane"", E was in position 5. So in the next guess, we can try E in positions 1,2,3, or 4.

 Let's consider a word with E in the middle or beginning to try to locate its position.

 Example: ""SPITE"" has E at the end? No, that's position 5 again. But we know E is not at position 5? Actually, no: the feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5, so we cannot put E at position 5 in our next guess? Actually, we can, but it would be a wasted opportunity because we already know it's not there. Alternatively, we can try to put E in a new position to test.

 However, note that the feedback symbol for E was ""-"" meaning that E is present but not in position 5. So if we put E in another position and we get ✓, then we know it's correct. If we get ""-"" again, then we know that position is also wrong. If we get ""x"" when putting E in another position? That would be impossible because we know E is in the word.

 So we definitely want to include E, but not in position 5.

 Let's pick a word that has E in position 1,2,3, or 4 and uses other common letters.

 Some candidate words:
 - ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> E in position 5? No, we want to avoid position 5. Also, position 5 is bad because we already know E is not there.
   Actually, in ""STOLE"", E is in position 5. So we avoid that.

 - ""HOUSE"": E in position 5 -> avoid.

 - ""TIMES"": E in position 5 -> avoid.

 - ""STEEP"": E in position 5 -> avoid.

 - ""THIEF"": E in position 4 -> this is good (positions: 1-T, 2-H, 3-I, 4-E, 5-F). But note: we must avoid C,R,A,N. THIEF: T, H, I, E, F. None of C,R,A,N. So it's acceptable.

 However, is ""THIEF"" a valid word? Yes.

 But let's think: another word might be ""QUITE"", but it has E at the end? No, ""QUITE"" -> Q-U-I-T-E, so E is at position 5.

 Alternatively, ""FIELD"": F-I-E-L-D -> E at position 3. So that's acceptable. But let's check letters: F, I, E, L, D. Avoids C,R,A,N.

 Another option: ""BELOW"": B-E-L-O-W -> E at position 2. Avoids C,R,A,N.

 But we want to maximize the number of new common letters. Let's consider frequency.

 After vowels, common consonants: S, T, L, D, M, etc.

 Considering words with E and without C,R,A,N:

 Possible words: 
   ""BONES"" -> but N is eliminated? We know N is not in the word. Feedback was N(x) so no. So we cannot use N either.
   Similarly, we cannot use C,R,A,N.

 So we must avoid C,R,A,N in the new word.

 List of available letters: 
   We know E is in the word, and we don't know 4 other letters. We must choose from the remaining alphabet without C,R,A,N.

 We can try to use S, T, L, O, I, D, H, etc.

 Let me try to find a word that has E and common letters, and avoid C,R,A,N and also avoid other less common letters.

 One example: ""STOLE"" is invalid because it has E at the end? And also we can't use that because of position? We can't use E at the end? Actually we can, but it would be bad strategy because we already know E isn't there. So we avoid position 5 for E.

 ""STEEL"" -> E at positions 3 and 4? Actually:

   Position: S(1), T(2), E(3), E(4), L(5) -> but L(5) is okay? But E in position 3 and 4. However, the word has two E's? We don't know if the word has duplicate E. But that is a possibility.

 But note: in the first guess ""crane"", E got a ""-"", meaning the word has at least one E. It might have more.

 But let me think: the word ""STEEL"" has E in position 3 and 4. But we know E is not at position 5? Position 5 is L. 

 However, we want to test E in a different position? So we can try E at position 1, for instance? How about ""ELBOW""? But O in position 4? And W at the end? Actually, ""ELBOW"": E at position 1.

 But we need a 5-letter word: ""ELBOW"" is 5 letters.

 But let's consider: 
   ""ELBOW"": E, L, B, O, W -> no C,R,A,N. We don't know if L, B, O, W are in the word? But we can try.

 However, we can also try to cover more frequent letters: T and S are very common.

 How about ""STYLE"": S, T, Y, L, E -> E is at position 5? No, position 5: E -> that's the same issue.

 How about ""LOPES"": O, E -> but E at position 5? 
   ""SPIEL"": S, P, I, E, L -> E at position 4? This works.

 Is ""SPIEL"" valid? Yes, it's a word meaning a long or important game in sports (or a form of gambling).

But note: we must avoid C,R,A,N. THIEF: T, H, I, E, F. None of C,R,A,N. So it\'s acceptable.\n\n However, is ""THIEF"" a valid word? Yes.\n\n But let\'s think: another word might be ""QUITE"", but it has E at the end? No, ""QUITE"" -> Q-U-I-T-E, so E is at position 5.\n\n Alternatively, ""FIELD"": F-I-E-L-D -> E at position 3. So that\'s acceptable. But let\'s check letters: F, I, E, L, D. Avoids C,R,A,N.\n\n Another option: ""BELOW"": B-E-L-O-W -> E at position 2. Avoids C,R,A,N.\n\n But we want to maximize the number of new common letters. Let\'s consider frequency.\n\n After vowels, common consonants: S, T, L, D, M, etc.\n\n Considering words with E and without C,R,A,N:\n\n Possible words: \n   ""BONES"" -> but N is eliminated? We know N is not in the word. Feedback was N(x) so no. So we cannot use N either.\n   Similarly, we cannot use C,R,A,N.\n\n So we must avoid C,R,A,N in the new word.\n\n List of available letters: \n   We know E is in the word, and we don\'t know 4 other letters. We must choose from the remaining alphabet without C,R,A,N.\n\n We can try to use S, T, L, O, I, D, H, etc.\n\n Let me try to find a word that has E and common letters, and avoid C,R,A,N and also avoid other less common letters.\n\n One example: ""STOLE"" is invalid because it has E at the end? And also we can\'t use that because of position? We can\'t use E at the end? Actually we can, but it would be bad strategy because we already know E isn\'t there. So we avoid position 5 for E.\n\n ""STEEL"" -> E at positions 3 and 4? Actually:\n\n   Position: S(1), T(2), E(3), E(4), L(5) -> but L(5) is okay? But E in position 3 and 4. However, the word has two E\'s? We don\'t know if the word has duplicate E. But that is a possibility.\n\n But note: in the first guess ""crane"", E got a ""-"", meaning the word has at least one E. It might have more.\n\n But let me think: the word ""STEEL"" has E in position 3 and 4. But we know E is not at position 5? Position 5 is L. \n\n However, we want to test E in a different position? So we can try E at position 1, for instance? How about ""ELBOW""? But O in position 4? And W at the end? Actually, ""ELBOW"": E at position 1.\n\n But we need a 5-letter word: ""ELBOW"" is 5 letters.\n\n But let\'s consider: \n   ""ELBOW"": E, L, B, O, W -> no C,R,A,N. We don\'t know if L, B, O, W are in the word? But we can try.\n\n However, we can also try to cover more frequent letters: T and S are very common.\n\n How about ""STYLE"": S, T, Y, L, E -> E is at position 5? No, position 5: E -> that\'s the same issue.\n\n How about ""LOPES"": O, E -> but E at position 5? \n   ""SPIEL"": S, P, I, E, L -> E at position 4? This works.\n\n Is ""SPIEL"" valid? Yes, it\'s a word meaning a long or important game in sports (or a form of gambling).\n\n Alternative: ""POISE"": P, O, I, S, E -> E at position 5 -> avoid.\n\n Another: ""OWLET"": O, W, L, E, T -> E at position 4 -> acceptable.\n\n But note: in the first guess, all positions except E were wrong. So the word does not have C, R, A, N.\n\n We have to make a guess that includes E and avoids C, R, A, N.\n\n After some thought, let me pick ""THIEF"": T, H, I, E, F -> E at position 4.\n\n Why ""THIEF""? \n   - It has E in position 4 (testing a new position)\n   - It uses T, H, I, F: all common letters.\n\n Alternatively, we could choose ""SLEEP"": S, L, E, E, P -> E in positions 3 and 4? That\'s two E\'s? We don\'t know if duplicate letters are allowed? The rules don\'t say duplicates are forbidden, but the secret word might have duplicates? Actually, Wordle sometimes has duplicate letters? The rules didn\'t specify.\n\n Given our feedback: only one E was shown in the first guess? But we don\'t know if there are duplicates. The feedback for ""crane"" showed E as present but wrong position. That doesn\'t rule out duplicates.\n\n In ""THIEF"", we are testing E at position 4. Also, we are testing T, H, I, F.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose ""SHINE"": S, H, I, N, E -> but wait, we cannot use N? Because N was eliminated? In the first feedback, N was marked ""x"", meaning no N in the word. So we cannot use N.\n\n Therefore, ""SHINE"" is invalid.\n\n Similarly, ""THINE"" has N -> invalid.\n\n So ""THIEF"" seems good.\n\n Another candidate: ""MOVIE"": M, O, V, I, E -> E at position 5 -> avoid.\n\n ""PIXIE"": P, I, X, I, E -> E at position 5? avoid.\n\n ""DOGES"": D, O, G, E, S -> E at position 4? This works. Letters: D, O, G, E, S -> no C,R,A,N.\n\n But G is less common? Maybe we can do better.\n\n Let\'s pick ""STOLE"" if we put E in position 5? But that would be bad because we know E is not at position 5. So we avoid that.\n\n Another: ""STEEL"" has E in positions 3 and 4? And S and T? But S and T are common. Then let me consider ""STEEL"". But that would use two E\'s? It\'s acceptable? And we already avoided C,R,A,N? Yes.\n\n But I prefer a word without duplicates if possible? Because duplicates are less common? And we can get more information if we try five distinct letters? But THIEF doesn\'t have duplicates? Yes, THIEF is distinct.\n\n Alternatively, ""SLEEK"" -> E at positions 3 and 4? But then we are testing E in two positions? \n\n Considering efficiency, I think ""THIEF"" is a good choice.\n\n Another word: ""OILED"": O, I, L, E, D -> E at position 4. Avoids C,R,A,N. Distinct letters.\n\n Or ""FIELD"": F, I, E, L, D -> E at position 3.\n\n Why FIELD? E at position 3.\n\n However, in the first word ""crane"", E was at position 5 and that was wrong. Now putting E at position 3? We are testing in a different position.\n\n Actually, we don\'t know where E is, so any position (1-4) is possible.\n\n I think we\'ll go with ""THIEF"".\n\n Steps:\n   We include E and put it at position 4.\n   We avoid C,R,A,N.\n   We choose T, H, I, F: common letters.\n\n Let me check: T is very common, H common, I common vowel, F less common but acceptable.\n\n If I\'m concerned about F, we might choose a word with L or S? But ""THIEF"" has S? No, it has T, H, I, E, F.\n\n Another word: ""WHITE"": W, H, I, T, E -> E at position 5 -> avoid.\n\n ""SHITE"" -> invalid? Or vulgar? Avoid. \n\n ""POSSE"" -> E at the end? Avoid.\n\n ""BREAD"" -> has R and A? Eliminated.\n\n So ""THIEF"" is acceptable.\n\n Therefore, my second guess is ""THIEF"". \n\n Important: the response format must be <guess>thief</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- ✓: None (no correct positions)\n- -: E (present but not in position 5)\n- x: C, R, A, N (not in the word at all)\n\nKey deductions:\n1. The secret word contains ""E"" but not in the last position (positions 1–4 possible).\n2. Letters C, R, A, N are eliminated entirely.\n3. The next guess must:\n   - Include ""E"" in positions 1–4.\n   - Avoid C, R, A, N.\n   - Use new common letters to maximize information (e.g., S, T, L, O, I, D).\n\nSelected guess: **""thief""**  \n- Places ""E"" in position 4 (testing a new position).\n- Uses common letters: T, H, I, F (all untested).\n- Valid 5-letter word avoiding eliminated letters.\n\n<guess>thief</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: thief -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) I(x) E(-) F(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are on the third guess. Previous feedback:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: thief -> T(x) H(x) I(x) E(-) F(x)

Analysis:
From guess 1:
- E is in the word but not in position 5.
- C, R, A, N are not in the word.

From guess 2:
- E is again marked as '-' meaning it is in the word but not in position 4 (since in ""thief"", E was at position 4). 
- T, H, I, F are not in the word.

So, combining:
- Letters eliminated: C, R, A, N, T, H, I, F
- The word contains E, but we know it's not in position 4 (from guess 2) and not in position 5 (from guess 1).

Therefore, E must be in one of the first three positions: 1, 2, or 3.

Now, what letters do we know are in the word? Only E so far. But we have eliminated many letters.

Also, we know the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, T, H, I, F.

We need to think of a new word that:
- Includes E in position 1, 2, or 3 (since positions 4 and 5 are invalid for E).
- Avoids the eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, T, H, I, F.
- Uses common remaining letters.

What letters remain? The alphabet minus the eliminated ones.

Eliminated letters: A, C, F, H, I, N, R, T. That's 8 letters.

Remaining letters: B, D, G, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common letters among these: S, O, L, D, U, M, P, etc.

We need to find a 5-letter word with E in position 1, 2, or 3, and using the remaining letters.

Also, since E is possibly in position 1,2, or 3, we might want to test multiple positions? But we can only place E in one position per guess.

Let's think: we can try to put E in position 1 to test if it's there? Or in position 2? Or 3?

Moreover, we need to cover as many new common letters as possible.

Let me list possible words:

- Position 1: E ...
  Words: E.g., ""EOSIN"" - but O is okay? But ""EOSIN"" isn't common. 
  ""ELOPS""? Not common.
  More common: ""EPOXY""? Has P, O, X, Y -> but X and Y are less common? 
  ""EBOOK""? Not 5 letters.

  Better: ""SPELT"" - but T is eliminated? T is in eliminated list.

  Avoiding T, etc.

  How about ""EDGES""? E in pos1, but then D,G,E,S -> but E repeated? And G is okay? 
  But note: ""EDGES"" has two E's? First E and last E? But last E: position 5? But we know E is not in pos5? We know E is in the word but not in pos5? So if we use E in pos5, it will be marked wrong? But our goal is to find the word, not avoid known wrong positions? Actually, we shouldn't waste positions.

  Alternatively, ""EUPES""? Not a word.

  Let me think of better words: ""EMBUS""? Not common.

  Perhaps position 2 might be better?

- Position 2: ... E ...

  Words: ""LEMES""? Not good.
    ""BEVEL""? B,E,V,E,L -> two E's? And V? 
    ""LEVEL""? Also two E's and L? But L is okay? And V? 
    ""LEGES""? Not common.

  Common words: 
    ""BELOW"": B,E,L,O,W -> E in pos2 -> avoids eliminated letters. And B,L,O,W are new.
    ""DELVE"": D,E,L,V,E -> two E's? V is okay? But V is less common? 
    ""HELPS""? H eliminated? No, H is eliminated? H is in eliminated list? Yes.

  Without eliminated? ""BELOW"" seems good: letters B,E,L,O,W -> none of the eliminated? 
    Eliminated: A,C,F,H,I,N,R,T -> so B,L,O,W are okay.

- Position 3: ... E ...
  Words: ""MODEM""? M,O,D,E,M -> two M's? And E in pos4? Wait, M-O-D-E-M: positions 1-M, 2-O, 3-D, 4-E, 5-M? Then E in pos4? But we already know E is not in pos4? So that's bad? But in this word, E is at 4? We should avoid putting E in pos4 because we know it's not there.

  Correct word: we need E in pos3? So something like: _ _ E _ _

  Example: ""OWEES""? Not common.
    ""STEEL"" -> S,T,E,E,L -> but T is eliminated? And E at pos3 and pos4? And T is bad? Eliminated?
    ""BLEED"" -> B,L,E,E,D -> E at pos3 and pos4? But we know E cannot be at pos4? So in ""BLEED"", if we put E at pos3 and pos4, then pos4 will be wrong? And also L,B,D are new? 
    But we are allowed to test, but note: if the word does not have duplicate E, then having E at pos3 might help? But we don't know?

  Actually, ""BELOW"" seems like a good candidate because it uses common letters: B,L,O,W and E at position 2.

  Also, ""MOVED"": M,O,V,E,D -> E in pos4? Avoid because pos4 is bad for E? We know E is not in pos4? So putting E in pos4 would definitely get marked as '-'? Since we know E is present? But the feedback would show E as '-', which we already know? So that is redundant? Worse, we lose the chance to test a new position.

  Therefore, choosing a word with E in an untested position? We have tested E at pos5 and pos4? So untested: pos1,2,3.

  We've tested: pos5 (guess1) and pos4 (guess2) -> both were wrong? So we should test E at pos1,2, or 3? 

  Let me prioritize common words: 
    ""BELOW"": E in pos2 -> position we haven't tested? So if E is at pos2, we might get ✓ for E? If not, and we got '-', then we know E can't be at pos2? Or if we put E at pos2 and we get -, that would be bad because we expect E to be at pos2? Actually, no: the '-' means it's in the word but not in that position? Which we already know? So we expect that unless pos2 is correct.

  Actually, if we put E in pos2 and the word has E at pos2? Then we get ✓? Else, if it has E at pos1, pos3, etc., we get '-'? So yes, testing E at pos2 will tell us if it is in pos2? Or not? If not, then E must be in pos1 or pos3? Since we know pos4 and pos5 are wrong.

  Therefore, ""BELOW"" is a good candidate? And it has B, L, O, W? All new letters? And common? 

  Common letters? L and O are common? B and W less so? But acceptable.

  Another option: ""SELFS""? Not valid? S,E,L,F,S -> F eliminated? Oh, F is eliminated? From guess2: F(x) -> so F is out.

  Similarly, ""SELES""? Maybe? S,E,L,E,S -> two S and two E? E in pos2? And S? But S is okay? But then we have duplicate? 

  How about ""SOLVE""? S,O,L,V,E -> E in pos5? Avoid pos5? 

  ""POSSE""? P,O,S,S,E -> E in pos5? Avoid.

  ""BESOM""? B,E,S,O,M -> E in pos2? Same as BELOW? And letters S,O,M? More common? 

  ""BESOM""? That's a word? BESOM: a broom made of twigs. So valid? Alternatively, ""BLEBS""? Not common? 

  But ""BELOW"" is more common? 

  Also, ""BELOW"": word meaning underneath.

  So let me pick ""BELOW""? 

  Another candidate: ""DEMES""? Not common? 

  Perhaps ""LEMONS""? Not 5 letters? 

  How about ""OGLED""? O,G,L,E,D -> E in pos4? We know E not in pos4? So avoid? 

  Therefore, let me go with ""BELOW"".

  We'll use ""BELOW"": 
    Position1: B
    Position2: E
    Position3: L
    Position4: O
    Position5: W

  We are testing:
    E at position2? If it becomes ✓, then we know E is at 2? Else, if '-'? Then we know E is not at 2? But we already know E is present? So if '-' we know E is at 1 or 3? 
    Also, we test B, L, O, W? 

  Now, the response: after this, we'll get feedback? 

  So our third guess: BELOW.

  But note: we are not using S? But S is a very common letter. Maybe we could use a word with S? 

  Is there a word with E in position1, 2, or 3 and S? And without eliminated letters?

  For example: 
    Position1: E and then S? E.g., ""EOSIN"" invalid? 
    Position2: ...E... with S? ""DESKS"" -> D,E,S,K,S -> but K and S? Or ""MESAS""? M,E,S,A,S -> A eliminated? A is eliminated? 
    ""YESES"" -> Y,E,S,E,S? 
    Position3: ...E... with S? ""BLESS"" -> B,L,E,S,S? E in pos3? And B,L,E,S? Avoids eliminated? No H,I,F? But S? 

  ""BLESS"": B,L,E,S,S -> letters: B,L,E,S? Then S at the end? And S repeated? But acceptable? 
  But E is in pos3? Which is untested? 

  Compare ""BLESS"" vs ""BELOW""? 
    ""BLESS"": E at pos3, and includes S? Which is common? 
    ""BELOW"": E at pos2? Which is also untested? 

  Since S is common? We might prefer ""BLESS""? 

  How about ""BLUES""? B,L,U,E,S -> E in pos4? But we know E is not in pos4? So avoid? 

  ""BOLES""? B,O,L,E,S -> E in pos4? Again bad? 

  ""BOXES""? B,O,X,E,S -> E in pos4? Same? 

  ""BUSES""? B,U,S,E,S -> E in pos4? Again? 

  ""BASES""? A eliminated? 

  So to have S and E not at the ends? 
    ""SUEDE""? S,U,E,D,E -> E at pos3 and pos5? But pos5 is bad? So duplicate E? 
    But in ""SUEDE"": positions: S1, U2, E3, D4, E5? E is in pos3 and pos5? But we know E not in pos5? So if we guess ""SUEDE"", E at pos5 will be marked incorrectly? But that doesn't help? And we already know? 

  Alternatively, ""SETUP""? S,E,T,U,P -> E in pos2? But T eliminated? 

  With S and E? Position2: perhaps ""LESBO"" invalid? Better skip.

  ""MESSY""? M,E,S,S,Y -> E in pos2? But then S? 

  Actually, ""MESSY"" -> M,E,S,S,Y -> no eliminated letters? Eliminated: A,C,F,H,I,N,R,T? So M,E,S,S,Y -> M, S, Y are okay? And E in pos2? 

  But ""MESSY"" has two S? That might be good? But common? 

  Another: ""JESSY""? Uncommon? 

  But to maximize S? How about ""PRESS""? P,R,E,S,S -> R eliminated? 

  ""DRESS""? D,R,E,S,S -> R eliminated? 

  ""GLESS""? Not word? 

  Therefore, perhaps ""BELOW"" is better? Or ""BLESS""? But ""BLESS"" has E in pos3? 

  Let me try ""BLESS"": B,L,E,S,S -> positions: 1-B, 2-L, 3-E, 4-S, 5-S? Then E is in pos3? Which we haven't tested? 

  Now, ""BLESS"" vs ""BELOW"": which one?

  Both are valid? But ""BLESS"" includes S? And S is more common? 

  Also, ""BLESS"" tests E in pos3? Which is untested? And S? 

  So I think ""BLESS"" might be slightly better? Because S might be in the word? 

  Alternatively, we can consider ""POSED""? P,O,S,E,D -> E in pos4? Avoid.

  Therefore, I choose ""BLESS"".

  But wait: ""BLESS"" has two S? At positions 4 and 5? That might be a problem? But if the secret word has S? It will show accordingly? 

  Actually, I change my mind: ""BLESS"" has double S? Which might be redundant? Since we are trying to get new information? Two S might give feedback for S? But it's the same letter? So will the feedback show for both S? 

  According to the rules: each letter gets a symbol? So if the word has one S and we guess two? Then one S might be marked and the other not? 

  Example: suppose the word has S only once? Then one S might be marked and the other 'x'? 

  This can be messy? 

  Perhaps ""BLED"" isn't 5? 

  How about ""BLUE""? Not 5 letters? 

  Therefore, I think ""BELOW"" is safer? Because it doesn't repeat letters? So we test five distinct letters? 

  ""BELOW"": distinct letters: B,E,L,O,W -> all distinct? Yes.

  Whereas ""BLESS"" has B,L,E,S,S -> letters are B,L,E,S so only four unique? 

  For information gain, distinct letters are better? 

  So let me choose ""BELOW"".

  But wait: another word with E in position1? For example, ""EDGED""? D,G,E,D -> duplicate D and E? Avoid? 

  ""ELD"" not 5.

  ""EBOOK"" not 5.

  ""EMPTY""? M,P,T,Y -> E at pos1? But P,T,Y? T eliminated? T is out? 

  ""EPOXY"": E,P,O,X,Y -> distinct letters? X and Y are uncommon? But acceptable? 

  Compared to ""BELOW"": 
    BELOW: B,E,L,O,W
    EPOXY: E,P,O,X,Y

  Clearly BELOW uses more common letters? So I choose BELOW.

  Thus: third guess: BELOW

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
**Guess 1: CRANE → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)**  
- ✗ **C, R, A, N**: None of these letters are in the secret word.  
- ➖ **E**: The letter ""E"" is present in the secret word but **not in position 5**.  

**Guess 2: THIEF → Feedback: T(x) H(x) I(x) E(-) F**:  
- ✗ **T, H, I, F**: None of these letters are in the secret word.  
- ➖ **E**: ""E"" is present but **not in position 4**.  

### Key Deductions:
1. **Eliminated Letters**:  
   - Absent: **C, R, A, N, T, H, I, F** (8 letters total).  
   - Valid letters remaining: **B, D, G, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.  

2. **Status of ""E""**:  
   - ""E"" **is** in the secret word.  
   - It cannot be in position 4 or 5 (positions tested in Guesses 1–2).  
   - Therefore, ""E"" **must be in position 1, 2, or 3**.  

3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:  
   - Prioritize words with ""E"" in **untested positions (1, 2, or 3)**.  
   - Use **common remaining letters** to maximize information (e.g., **S, O, L, D, U, M, P**).  
   - Avoid eliminated letters and redundant positions for ""E"".  
   - Given the feedback, a word with ""E"" in position 2 is optimal to test that position succinctly.  

### Selected Guess: **BELOW**  
- **Structure**:  
  - **B**: Position 1 (new letter).  
  - **E**: Position 2 (tests untested position).  
  - **L**: Position 3 (common consonant).  
  - **O**: Position 4 (common vowel).  
  - **W**: Position 5 (new letter).  
- **Advantages**:  
  - Tests ""E"" in position 2 (new position).  
  - Uses 4 new common letters (**B, L, O, W**).  
  - Avoids eliminated letters and emphasizes untested high-frequency consonants/vowels.  
- **Potential Scenarios**:  
  - If ""E"" is in position 2 → ✓ for E (reveals correct position).  
  - If ""E"" is in position 1/3 → ➖ for E (narrows position to 1 or 3).  
  - Feedback on **B, L, O, W** will reveal new information about their presence/positions.  

Proceeding with **BELOW** as the third guess to systematically narrow down possibilities.  
<guess>below</guess>",below,"We are on the third guess. Previous feedback:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: thief -> T(x) H(x) I(x) E(-) F(x)

Analysis:
From guess 1:
- E is in the word but not in position 5.
- C, R, A, N are not in the word.

From guess 2:
- E is again marked as '-' meaning it is in the word but not in position 4 (since in ""thief"", E was at position 4). 
- T, H, I, F are not in the word.

So, combining:
- Letters eliminated: C, R, A, N, T, H, I, F
- The word contains E, but we know it's not in position 4 (from guess 2) and not in position 5 (from guess 1).

Therefore, E must be in one of the first three positions: 1, 2, or 3.

Now, what letters do we know are in the word? Only E so far. But we have eliminated many letters.

Also, we know the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, T, H, I, F.

We need to think of a new word that:
- Includes E in position 1, 2, or 3 (since positions 4 and 5 are invalid for E).
- Avoids the eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, T, H, I, F.
- Uses common remaining letters.

What letters remain? The alphabet minus the eliminated ones.

Eliminated letters: A, C, F, H, I, N, R, T. That's 8 letters.

Remaining letters: B, D, G, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common letters among these: S, O, L, D, U, M, P, etc.

We need to find a 5-letter word with E in position 1, 2, or 3, and using the remaining letters.

Also, since E is possibly in position 1,2, or 3, we might want to test multiple positions? But we can only place E in one position per guess.

Let's think: we can try to put E in position 1 to test if it's there? Or in position 2? Or 3?

Moreover, we need to cover as many new common letters as possible.

Let me list possible words:

- Position 1: E ...
  Words: E.g., ""EOSIN"" - but O is okay? But ""EOSIN"" isn't common. 
  ""ELOPS""? Not common.
  More common: ""EPOXY""? Has P, O, X, Y -> but X and Y are less common? 
  ""EBOOK""? Not 5 letters.

  Better: ""SPELT"" - but T is eliminated? T is in eliminated list.

  Avoiding T, etc.

  How about ""EDGES""? E in pos1, but then D,G,E,S -> but E repeated? And G is okay? 
  But note: ""EDGES"" has two E's? First E and last E? But last E: position 5? But we know E is not in pos5? We know E is in the word but not in pos5? So if we use E in pos5, it will be marked wrong? But our goal is to find the word, not avoid known wrong positions? Actually, we shouldn't waste positions.

  Alternatively, ""EUPES""? Not a word.

  Let me think of better words: ""EMBUS""? Not common.

  Perhaps position 2 might be better?

- Position 2: ... E ...

  Words: ""LEMES""? Not good.
    ""BEVEL""? B,E,V,E,L -> two E's? And V? 
    ""LEVEL""? Also two E's and L? But L is okay? And V? 
    ""LEGES""? Not common.

  Common words: 
    ""BELOW"": B,E,L,O,W -> E in pos2 -> avoids eliminated letters. And B,L,O,W are new.
    ""DELVE"": D,E,L,V,E -> two E's? V is okay? But V is less common? 
    ""HELPS""? H eliminated? No, H is eliminated? H is in eliminated list? Yes.

  Without eliminated? ""BELOW"" seems good: letters B,E,L,O,W -> none of the eliminated? 
    Eliminated: A,C,F,H,I,N,R,T -> so B,L,O,W are okay.

- Position 3: ... E ...
  Words: ""MODEM""? M,O,D,E,M -> two M's? And E in pos4? Wait, M-O-D-E-M: positions 1-M, 2-O, 3-D, 4-E, 5-M? Then E in pos4? But we already know E is not in pos4? So that's bad? But in this word, E is at 4? We should avoid putting E in pos4 because we know it's not there.

  Correct word: we need E in pos3? So something like: _ _ E _ _

  Example: ""OWEES""? Not common.
    ""STEEL"" -> S,T,E,E,L -> but T is eliminated? And E at pos3 and pos4? And T is bad? Eliminated?
    ""BLEED"" -> B,L,E,E,D -> E at pos3 and pos4? But we know E cannot be at pos4? So in ""BLEED"", if we put E at pos3 and pos4, then pos4 will be wrong? And also L,B,D are new? 
    But we are allowed to test, but note: if the word does not have duplicate E, then having E at pos3 might help? But we don't know?

  Actually, ""BELOW"" seems like a good candidate because it uses common letters: B,L,O,W and E at position 2.

  Also, ""MOVED"": M,O,V,E,D -> E in pos4? Avoid because pos4 is bad for E? We know E is not in pos4? So putting E in pos4 would definitely get marked as '-'? Since we know E is present? But the feedback would show E as '-', which we already know? So that is redundant? Worse, we lose the chance to test a new position.

  Therefore, choosing a word with E in an untested position? We have tested E at pos5 and pos4? So untested: pos1,2,3.

  We've tested: pos5 (guess1) and pos4 (guess2) -> both were wrong? So we should test E at pos1,2, or 3? 

  Let me prioritize common words: 
    ""BELOW"": E in pos2 -> position we haven't tested? So if E is at pos2, we might get ✓ for E? If not, and we got '-', then we know E can't be at pos2? Or if we put E at pos2 and we get -, that would be bad because we expect E to be at pos2? Actually, no: the '-' means it's in the word but not in that position? Which we already know? So we expect that unless pos2 is correct.

  Actually, if we put E in pos2 and the word has E at pos2? Then we get ✓? Else, if it has E at pos1, pos3, etc., we get '-'? So yes, testing E at pos2 will tell us if it is in pos2? Or not? If not, then E must be in pos1 or pos3? Since we know pos4 and pos5 are wrong.

  Therefore, ""BELOW"" is a good candidate? And it has B, L, O, W? All new letters? And common? 

  Common letters? L and O are common? B and W less so? But acceptable.

  Another option: ""SELFS""? Not valid? S,E,L,F,S -> F eliminated? Oh, F is eliminated? From guess2: F(x) -> so F is out.

  Similarly, ""SELES""? Maybe? S,E,L,E,S -> two S and two E? E in pos2? And S? But S is okay? But then we have duplicate? 

  How about ""SOLVE""? S,O,L,V,E -> E in pos5? Avoid pos5? 

  ""POSSE""? P,O,S,S,E -> E in pos5? Avoid.

  ""BESOM""? B,E,S,O,M -> E in pos2? Same as BELOW? And letters S,O,M? More common? 

  ""BESOM""? That's a word? BESOM: a broom made of twigs. So valid? Alternatively, ""BLEBS""? Not common? 

  But ""BELOW"" is more common? 

  Also, ""BELOW"": word meaning underneath.

  So let me pick ""BELOW""? 

  Another candidate: ""DEMES""? Not common? 

  Perhaps ""LEMONS""? Not 5 letters? 

  How about ""OGLED""? O,G,L,E,D -> E in pos4? We know E not in pos4? So avoid? 

  Therefore, let me go with ""BELOW"".

  We'll use ""BELOW"": 
    Position1: B
    Position2: E
    Position3: L
    Position4: O
    Position5: W

  We are testing:
    E at position2? If it becomes ✓, then we know E is at 2? Else, if '-'? Then we know E is not at 2? But we already know E is present? So if '-' we know E is at 1 or 3? 
    Also, we test B, L, O, W? 

  Now, the response: after this, we'll get feedback? 

  So our third guess: BELOW.

  But note: we are not using S? But S is a very common letter. Maybe we could use a word with S? 

  Is there a word with E in position1, 2, or 3 and S? And without eliminated letters?

  For example: 
    Position1: E and then S? E.g., ""EOSIN"" invalid? 
    Position2: ...E... with S? ""DESKS"" -> D,E,S,K,S -> but K and S? Or ""MESAS""? M,E,S,A,S -> A eliminated? A is eliminated? 
    ""YESES"" -> Y,E,S,E,S? 
    Position3: ...E... with S? ""BLESS"" -> B,L,E,S,S? E in pos3? And B,L,E,S? Avoids eliminated? No H,I,F? But S? 

  ""BLESS"": B,L,E,S,S -> letters: B,L,E,S? Then S at the end? And S repeated? But acceptable? 
  But E is in pos3? Which is untested? 

  Compare ""BLESS"" vs ""BELOW""? 
    ""BLESS"": E at pos3, and includes S? Which is common? 
    ""BELOW"": E at pos2? Which is also untested? 

  Since S is common? We might prefer ""BLESS""? 

  How about ""BLUES""? B,L,U,E,S -> E in pos4? But we know E is not in pos4? So avoid? 

  ""BOLES""? B,O,L,E,S -> E in pos4? Again bad? 

  ""BOXES""? B,O,X,E,S -> E in pos4? Same? 

  ""BUSES""? B,U,S,E,S -> E in pos4? Again? 

  ""BASES""? A eliminated? 

  So to have S and E not at the ends? 
    ""SUEDE""? S,U,E,D,E -> E at pos3 and pos5? But pos5 is bad? So duplicate E? 
    But in ""SUEDE"": positions: S1, U2, E3, D4, E5? E is in pos3 and pos5? But we know E not in pos5? So if we guess ""SUEDE"", E at pos5 will be marked incorrectly? But that doesn't help? And we already know? 

  Alternatively, ""SETUP""? S,E,T,U,P -> E in pos2? But T eliminated? 

  With S and E? Position2: perhaps ""LESBO"" invalid? Better skip.

  ""MESSY""? M,E,S,S,Y -> E in pos2? But then S? 

  Actually, ""MESSY"" -> M,E,S,S,Y -> no eliminated letters? Eliminated: A,C,F,H,I,N,R,T? So M,E,S,S,Y -> M, S, Y are okay? And E in pos2? 

  But ""MESSY"" has two S? That might be good? But common? 

  Another: ""JESSY""? Uncommon? 

  But to maximize S? How about ""PRESS""? P,R,E,S,S -> R eliminated? 

  ""DRESS""? D,R,E,S,S -> R eliminated? 

  ""GLESS""? Not word? 

  Therefore, perhaps ""BELOW"" is better? Or ""BLESS""? But ""BLESS"" has E in pos3? 

  Let me try ""BLESS"": B,L,E,S,S -> positions: 1-B, 2-L, 3-E, 4-S, 5-S? Then E is in pos3? Which we haven't tested? 

  Now, ""BLESS"" vs ""BELOW"": which one?

  Both are valid? But ""BLESS"" includes S? And S is more common? 

  Also, ""BLESS"" tests E in pos3? Which is untested? And S? 

  So I think ""BLESS"" might be slightly better? Because S might be in the word? 

  Alternatively, we can consider ""POSED""? P,O,S,E,D -> E in pos4? Avoid.

  Therefore, I choose ""BLESS"".

  But wait: ""BLESS"" has two S? At positions 4 and 5? That might be a problem? But if the secret word has S? It will show accordingly? 

  Actually, I change my mind: ""BLESS"" has double S? Which might be redundant? Since we are trying to get new information? Two S might give feedback for S? But it's the same letter? So will the feedback show for both S? 

  According to the rules: each letter gets a symbol? So if the word has one S and we guess two? Then one S might be marked and the other not? 

  Example: suppose the word has S only once? Then one S might be marked and the other 'x'? 

  This can be messy? 

  Perhaps ""BLED"" isn't 5? 

  How about ""BLUE""? Not 5 letters? 

  Therefore, I think ""BELOW"" is safer? Because it doesn't repeat letters? So we test five distinct letters? 

  ""BELOW"": distinct letters: B,E,L,O,W -> all distinct? Yes.

  Whereas ""BLESS"" has B,L,E,S,S -> letters are B,L,E,S so only four unique? 

  For information gain, distinct letters are better? 

  So let me choose ""BELOW"".

  But wait: another word with E in position1? For example, ""EDGED""? D,G,E,D -> duplicate D and E? Avoid? 

  ""ELD"" not 5.

  ""EBOOK"" not 5.

  ""EMPTY""? M,P,T,Y -> E at pos1? But P,T,Y? T eliminated? T is out? 

  ""EPOXY"": E,P,O,X,Y -> distinct letters? X and Y are uncommon? But acceptable? 

  Compared to ""BELOW"": 
    BELOW: B,E,L,O,W
    EPOXY: E,P,O,X,Y

  Clearly BELOW uses more common letters? So I choose BELOW.

  Thus: third guess: BELOW

  Format: <guess>below</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
**Guess 1: CRANE → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)**  
- ✗ **C, R, A, N**: None of these letters are in the secret word.  
- ➖ **E**: The letter ""E"" is present in the secret word but **not in position 5**.  

**Guess 2: THIEF → Feedback: T(x) H(x) I(x) E(-) F**:  
- ✗ **T, H, I, F**: None of these letters are in the secret word.  
- ➖ **E**: ""E"" is present but **not in position 4**.  

### Key Deductions:
1. **Eliminated Letters**:  
   - Absent: **C, R, A, N, T, H, I, F** (8 letters total).  
   - Valid letters remaining: **B, D, G, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.  

2. **Status of ""E""**:  
   - ""E"" **is** in the secret word.  
   - It cannot be in position 4 or 5 (positions tested in Guesses 1–2).  
   - Therefore, ""E"" **must be in position 1, 2, or 3**.  

3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:  
   - Prioritize words with ""E"" in **untested positions (1, 2, or 3)**.  
   - Use **common remaining letters** to maximize information (e.g., **S, O, L, D, U, M, P**).  
   - Avoid eliminated letters and redundant positions for ""E"".  
   - Given the feedback, a word with ""E"" in position 2 is optimal to test that position succinctly.  

### Selected Guess: **BELOW**  
- **Structure**:  
  - **B**: Position 1 (new letter).  
  - **E**: Position 2 (tests untested position).  
  - **L**: Position 3 (common consonant).  
  - **O**: Position 4 (common vowel).  
  - **W**: Position 5 (new letter).  
- **Advantages**:  
  - Tests ""E"" in position 2 (new position).  
  - Uses 4 new common letters (**B, L, O, W**).  
  - Avoids eliminated letters and emphasizes untested high-frequency consonants/vowels.  
- **Potential Scenarios**:  
  - If ""E"" is in position 2 → ✓ for E (reveals correct position).  
  - If ""E"" is in position 1/3 → ➖ for E (narrows position to 1 or 3).  
  - Feedback on **B, L, O, W** will reveal new information about their presence/positions.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has common letters: we want at least two vowels and some frequent consonants.
 The word ""ROAST"" is a good candidate because:
   - It contains 'R', 'O', 'A', 'S', 'T' — all common letters.
   - It has two vowels ('O' and 'A') and three consonants.

 Alternatively, we can consider ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"". But let's go with ""ROAST"" for now.

 However, note that the example in the rules used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", so we might avoid repeating those.

 Another popular choice is ""ADIEU"" because it has many vowels, but it has only one common consonant. We want to maximize information.

 I think ""CRANE"" is a very good starting word because:
   - It has three consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).
   - The letters C, R, A, N, E are all fairly common.

 But let me check: the word ""CRANE"" is valid.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also a strong starter.

 Since we are at the first guess, any of these is fine. I'll go with ""CRANE"".

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".I need to make the first guess in this Wordle-like game. Since there's no prior feedback, I should choose a starting word that maximizes information gain. A good starter typically includes common vowels and consonants to cover frequent letters in 5-letter words. 

I'll select ""CRANE"" because:
- It contains three vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (C, R, N)
- The letters C, R, A, N, E appear frequently in English words
- It avoids repeating letters, allowing broader coverage
- It's a balanced word that often reveals useful positional clues

This choice should help narrow down possibilities efficiently based on the feedback symbols (✓, -, x) I receive.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are on the second guess. Previous feedback for ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-). 
 This means:
  - 'E' is in the secret word but not in the fifth position (since it got ""-"", meaning it's present but in the wrong position).
  - C, R, A, N are NOT in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter 'E' but not in the last position. Also, the word does not contain C, R, A, or N.

 Since we have eliminated C, R, A, N, we must avoid using them.

 The letter 'E' must be in one of the first four positions? Actually, no: the feedback ""-"" for E just means it is in the word but not in the 5th position. It could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 Our next guess should include the letter 'E' (since we know it is in the word) and avoid C, R, A, N.

 We should also try to cover other common letters to get more information.

 Common letters in 5-letter words (excluding C,R,A,N): E, S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.

 Since we have only one known letter 'E', let's try to choose a word that has 'E' and other common letters not tried yet.

 Possibilities: words like ""SPITE"", ""TIMES"", ""STOLE"", ""HOUSE"", etc. But note: we must avoid the letters C, R, A, N.

 Important: the word must have 'E', and we should place 'E' in a position that is not the fifth (since we know it's not at the end). But also, since we don't know the position of E yet, we can try putting it in a different position than last time.

 In ""crane"", E was in position 5. So in the next guess, we can try E in positions 1,2,3, or 4.

 Let's consider a word with E in the middle or beginning to try to locate its position.

 Example: ""SPITE"" has E at the end? No, that's position 5 again. But we know E is not at position 5? Actually, no: the feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5, so we cannot put E at position 5 in our next guess? Actually, we can, but it would be a wasted opportunity because we already know it's not there. Alternatively, we can try to put E in a new position to test.

 However, note that the feedback symbol for E was ""-"" meaning that E is present but not in position 5. So if we put E in another position and we get ✓, then we know it's correct. If we get ""-"" again, then we know that position is also wrong. If we get ""x"" when putting E in another position? That would be impossible because we know E is in the word.

 So we definitely want to include E, but not in position 5.

 Let's pick a word that has E in position 1,2,3, or 4 and uses other common letters.

 Some candidate words:
 - ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> E in position 5? No, we want to avoid position 5. Also, position 5 is bad because we already know E is not there.
   Actually, in ""STOLE"", E is in position 5. So we avoid that.

 - ""HOUSE"": E in position 5 -> avoid.

 - ""TIMES"": E in position 5 -> avoid.

 - ""STEEP"": E in position 5 -> avoid.

 - ""THIEF"": E in position 4 -> this is good (positions: 1-T, 2-H, 3-I, 4-E, 5-F). But note: we must avoid C,R,A,N. THIEF: T, H, I, E, F. None of C,R,A,N. So it's acceptable.

 However, is ""THIEF"" a valid word? Yes.

 But let's think: another word might be ""QUITE"", but it has E at the end? No, ""QUITE"" -> Q-U-I-T-E, so E is at position 5.

 Alternatively, ""FIELD"": F-I-E-L-D -> E at position 3. So that's acceptable. But let's check letters: F, I, E, L, D. Avoids C,R,A,N.

 Another option: ""BELOW"": B-E-L-O-W -> E at position 2. Avoids C,R,A,N.

 But we want to maximize the number of new common letters. Let's consider frequency.

 After vowels, common consonants: S, T, L, D, M, etc.

 Considering words with E and without C,R,A,N:

 Possible words: 
   ""BONES"" -> but N is eliminated? We know N is not in the word. Feedback was N(x) so no. So we cannot use N either.
   Similarly, we cannot use C,R,A,N.

 So we must avoid C,R,A,N in the new word.

 List of available letters: 
   We know E is in the word, and we don't know 4 other letters. We must choose from the remaining alphabet without C,R,A,N.

 We can try to use S, T, L, O, I, D, H, etc.

 Let me try to find a word that has E and common letters, and avoid C,R,A,N and also avoid other less common letters.

 One example: ""STOLE"" is invalid because it has E at the end? And also we can't use that because of position? We can't use E at the end? Actually we can, but it would be bad strategy because we already know E isn't there. So we avoid position 5 for E.

 ""STEEL"" -> E at positions 3 and 4? Actually:

   Position: S(1), T(2), E(3), E(4), L(5) -> but L(5) is okay? But E in position 3 and 4. However, the word has two E's? We don't know if the word has duplicate E. But that is a possibility.

 But note: in the first guess ""crane"", E got a ""-"", meaning the word has at least one E. It might have more.

 But let me think: the word ""STEEL"" has E in position 3 and 4. But we know E is not at position 5? Position 5 is L. 

 However, we want to test E in a different position? So we can try E at position 1, for instance? How about ""ELBOW""? But O in position 4? And W at the end? Actually, ""ELBOW"": E at position 1.

 But we need a 5-letter word: ""ELBOW"" is 5 letters.

 But let's consider: 
   ""ELBOW"": E, L, B, O, W -> no C,R,A,N. We don't know if L, B, O, W are in the word? But we can try.

 However, we can also try to cover more frequent letters: T and S are very common.

 How about ""STYLE"": S, T, Y, L, E -> E is at position 5? No, position 5: E -> that's the same issue.

 How about ""LOPES"": O, E -> but E at position 5? 
   ""SPIEL"": S, P, I, E, L -> E at position 4? This works.

 Is ""SPIEL"" valid? Yes, it's a word meaning a long or important game in sports (or a form of gambling).

 Alternative: ""POISE"": P, O, I, S, E -> E at position 5 -> avoid.

 Another: ""OWLET"": O, W, L, E, T -> E at position 4 -> acceptable.

 But note: in the first guess, all positions except E were wrong. So the word does not have C, R, A, N.

 We have to make a guess that includes E and avoids C, R, A, N.

 After some thought, let me pick ""THIEF"": T, H, I, E, F -> E at position 4.

 Why ""THIEF""? 
   - It has E in position 4 (testing a new position)
   - It uses T, H, I, F: all common letters.

 Alternatively, we could choose ""SLEEP"": S, L, E, E, P -> E in positions 3 and 4? That's two E's? We don't know if duplicate letters are allowed? The rules don't say duplicates are forbidden, but the secret word might have duplicates? Actually, Wordle sometimes has duplicate letters? The rules didn't specify.

 Given our feedback: only one E was shown in the first guess? But we don't know if there are duplicates. The feedback for ""crane"" showed E as present but wrong position. That doesn't rule out duplicates.

 In ""THIEF"", we are testing E at position 4. Also, we are testing T, H, I, F.

 Alternatively, we can choose ""SHINE"": S, H, I, N, E -> but wait, we cannot use N? Because N was eliminated? In the first feedback, N was marked ""x"", meaning no N in the word. So we cannot use N.

 Therefore, ""SHINE"" is invalid.

 Similarly, ""THINE"" has N -> invalid.

 So ""THIEF"" seems good.

 Another candidate: ""MOVIE"": M, O, V, I, E -> E at position 5 -> avoid.

 ""PIXIE"": P, I, X, I, E -> E at position 5? avoid.

 ""DOGES"": D, O, G, E, S -> E at position 4? This works. Letters: D, O, G, E, S -> no C,R,A,N.

 But G is less common? Maybe we can do better.

 Let's pick ""STOLE"" if we put E in position 5? But that would be bad because we know E is not at position 5. So we avoid that.

 Another: ""STEEL"" has E in positions 3 and 4? And S and T? But S and T are common. Then let me consider ""STEEL"". But that would use two E's? It's acceptable? And we already avoided C,R,A,N? Yes.

 But I prefer a word without duplicates if possible? Because duplicates are less common? And we can get more information if we try five distinct letters? But THIEF doesn't have duplicates? Yes, THIEF is distinct.

 Alternatively, ""SLEEK"" -> E at positions 3 and 4? But then we are testing E in two positions? 

 Considering efficiency, I think ""THIEF"" is a good choice.

 Another word: ""OILED"": O, I, L, E, D -> E at position 4. Avoids C,R,A,N. Distinct letters.

 Or ""FIELD"": F, I, E, L, D -> E at position 3.

 Why FIELD? E at position 3.

 However, in the first word ""crane"", E was at position 5 and that was wrong. Now putting E at position 3? We are testing in a different position.

 Actually, we don't know where E is, so any position (1-4) is possible.

 I think we'll go with ""THIEF"".

 Steps:
   We include E and put it at position 4.
   We avoid C,R,A,N.
   We choose T, H, I, F: common letters.

 Let me check: T is very common, H common, I common vowel, F less common but acceptable.

 If I'm concerned about F, we might choose a word with L or S? But ""THIEF"" has S? No, it has T, H, I, E, F.

 Another word: ""WHITE"": W, H, I, T, E -> E at position 5 -> avoid.

 ""SHITE"" -> invalid? Or vulgar? Avoid. 

 ""POSSE"" -> E at the end? Avoid.

 ""BREAD"" -> has R and A? Eliminated.

 So ""THIEF"" is acceptable.

 Therefore, my second guess is ""THIEF"". 

 Important: the response format must be <guess>thief</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- ✓: None (no correct positions)
- -: E (present but not in position 5)
- x: C, R, A, N (not in the word at all)

Key deductions:
1. The secret word contains ""E"" but not in the last position (positions 1–4 possible).
2. Letters C, R, A, N are eliminated entirely.
3. The next guess must:
   - Include ""E"" in positions 1–4.
   - Avoid C, R, A, N.
   - Use new common letters to maximize information (e.g., S, T, L, O, I, D).

Selected guess: **""thief""**  
- Places ""E"" in position 4 (testing a new position).
- Uses common letters: T, H, I, F (all untested).
- Valid 5-letter word avoiding eliminated letters.

<guess>thief</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: thief -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) I(x) E(-) F(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are on the third guess. Previous feedback:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: thief -> T(x) H(x) I(x) E(-) F(x)

Analysis:
From guess 1:
- E is in the word but not in position 5.
- C, R, A, N are not in the word.

From guess 2:
- E is again marked as '-' meaning it is in the word but not in position 4 (since in ""thief"", E was at position 4). 
- T, H, I, F are not in the word.

So, combining:
- Letters eliminated: C, R, A, N, T, H, I, F
- The word contains E, but we know it's not in position 4 (from guess 2) and not in position 5 (from guess 1).

Therefore, E must be in one of the first three positions: 1, 2, or 3.

Now, what letters do we know are in the word? Only E so far. But we have eliminated many letters.

Also, we know the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, T, H, I, F.

We need to think of a new word that:
- Includes E in position 1, 2, or 3 (since positions 4 and 5 are invalid for E).
- Avoids the eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, T, H, I, F.
- Uses common remaining letters.

What letters remain? The alphabet minus the eliminated ones.

Eliminated letters: A, C, F, H, I, N, R, T. That's 8 letters.

Remaining letters: B, D, G, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common letters among these: S, O, L, D, U, M, P, etc.

We need to find a 5-letter word with E in position 1, 2, or 3, and using the remaining letters.

Also, since E is possibly in position 1,2, or 3, we might want to test multiple positions? But we can only place E in one position per guess.

Let's think: we can try to put E in position 1 to test if it's there? Or in position 2? Or 3?

Moreover, we need to cover as many new common letters as possible.

Let me list possible words:

- Position 1: E ...
  Words: E.g., ""EOSIN"" - but O is okay? But ""EOSIN"" isn't common. 
  ""ELOPS""? Not common.
  More common: ""EPOXY""? Has P, O, X, Y -> but X and Y are less common? 
  ""EBOOK""? Not 5 letters.

  Better: ""SPELT"" - but T is eliminated? T is in eliminated list.

  Avoiding T, etc.

  How about ""EDGES""? E in pos1, but then D,G,E,S -> but E repeated? And G is okay? 
  But note: ""EDGES"" has two E's? First E and last E? But last E: position 5? But we know E is not in pos5? We know E is in the word but not in pos5? So if we use E in pos5, it will be marked wrong? But our goal is to find the word, not avoid known wrong positions? Actually, we shouldn't waste positions.

  Alternatively, ""EUPES""? Not a word.

  Let me think of better words: ""EMBUS""? Not common.

  Perhaps position 2 might be better?

- Position 2: ... E ...

  Words: ""LEMES""? Not good.
    ""BEVEL""? B,E,V,E,L -> two E's? And V? 
    ""LEVEL""? Also two E's and L? But L is okay? And V? 
    ""LEGES""? Not common.

  Common words: 
    ""BELOW"": B,E,L,O,W -> E in pos2 -> avoids eliminated letters. And B,L,O,W are new.
    ""DELVE"": D,E,L,V,E -> two E's? V is okay? But V is less common? 
    ""HELPS""? H eliminated? No, H is eliminated? H is in eliminated list? Yes.

  Without eliminated? ""BELOW"" seems good: letters B,E,L,O,W -> none of the eliminated? 
    Eliminated: A,C,F,H,I,N,R,T -> so B,L,O,W are okay.

- Position 3: ... E ...
  Words: ""MODEM""? M,O,D,E,M -> two M's? And E in pos4? Wait, M-O-D-E-M: positions 1-M, 2-O, 3-D, 4-E, 5-M? Then E in pos4? But we already know E is not in pos4? So that's bad? But in this word, E is at 4? We should avoid putting E in pos4 because we know it's not there.

  Correct word: we need E in pos3? So something like: _ _ E _ _

  Example: ""OWEES""? Not common.
    ""STEEL"" -> S,T,E,E,L -> but T is eliminated? And E at pos3 and pos4? And T is bad? Eliminated?
    ""BLEED"" -> B,L,E,E,D -> E at pos3 and pos4? But we know E cannot be at pos4? So in ""BLEED"", if we put E at pos3 and pos4, then pos4 will be wrong? And also L,B,D are new? 
    But we are allowed to test, but note: if the word does not have duplicate E, then having E at pos3 might help? But we don't know?

  Actually, ""BELOW"" seems like a good candidate because it uses common letters: B,L,O,W and E at position 2.

  Also, ""MOVED"": M,O,V,E,D -> E in pos4? Avoid because pos4 is bad for E? We know E is not in pos4? So putting E in pos4 would definitely get marked as '-'? Since we know E is present? But the feedback would show E as '-', which we already know? So that is redundant? Worse, we lose the chance to test a new position.

  Therefore, choosing a word with E in an untested position? We have tested E at pos5 and pos4? So untested: pos1,2,3.

  We've tested: pos5 (guess1) and pos4 (guess2) -> both were wrong? So we should test E at pos1,2, or 3? 

  Let me prioritize common words: 
    ""BELOW"": E in pos2 -> position we haven't tested? So if E is at pos2, we might get ✓ for E? If not, and we got '-', then we know E can't be at pos2? Or if we put E at pos2 and we get -, that would be bad because we expect E to be at pos2? Actually, no: the '-' means it's in the word but not in that position? Which we already know? So we expect that unless pos2 is correct.

  Actually, if we put E in pos2 and the word has E at pos2? Then we get ✓? Else, if it has E at pos1, pos3, etc., we get '-'? So yes, testing E at pos2 will tell us if it is in pos2? Or not? If not, then E must be in pos1 or pos3? Since we know pos4 and pos5 are wrong.

  Therefore, ""BELOW"" is a good candidate? And it has B, L, O, W? All new letters? And common? 

  Common letters? L and O are common? B and W less so? But acceptable.

  Another option: ""SELFS""? Not valid? S,E,L,F,S -> F eliminated? Oh, F is eliminated? From guess2: F(x) -> so F is out.

  Similarly, ""SELES""? Maybe? S,E,L,E,S -> two S and two E? E in pos2? And S? But S is okay? But then we have duplicate? 

  How about ""SOLVE""? S,O,L,V,E -> E in pos5? Avoid pos5? 

  ""POSSE""? P,O,S,S,E -> E in pos5? Avoid.

  ""BESOM""? B,E,S,O,M -> E in pos2? Same as BELOW? And letters S,O,M? More common? 

  ""BESOM""? That's a word? BESOM: a broom made of twigs. So valid? Alternatively, ""BLEBS""? Not common? 

  But ""BELOW"" is more common? 

  Also, ""BELOW"": word meaning underneath.

  So let me pick ""BELOW""? 

  Another candidate: ""DEMES""? Not common? 

  Perhaps ""LEMONS""? Not 5 letters? 

  How about ""OGLED""? O,G,L,E,D -> E in pos4? We know E not in pos4? So avoid? 

  Therefore, let me go with ""BELOW"".

  We'll use ""BELOW"": 
    Position1: B
    Position2: E
    Position3: L
    Position4: O
    Position5: W

  We are testing:
    E at position2? If it becomes ✓, then we know E is at 2? Else, if '-'? Then we know E is not at 2? But we already know E is present? So if '-' we know E is at 1 or 3? 
    Also, we test B, L, O, W? 

  Now, the response: after this, we'll get feedback? 

  So our third guess: BELOW.

  But note: we are not using S? But S is a very common letter. Maybe we could use a word with S? 

  Is there a word with E in position1, 2, or 3 and S? And without eliminated letters?

  For example: 
    Position1: E and then S? E.g., ""EOSIN"" invalid? 
    Position2: ...E... with S? ""DESKS"" -> D,E,S,K,S -> but K and S? Or ""MESAS""? M,E,S,A,S -> A eliminated? A is eliminated? 
    ""YESES"" -> Y,E,S,E,S? 
    Position3: ...E... with S? ""BLESS"" -> B,L,E,S,S? E in pos3? And B,L,E,S? Avoids eliminated? No H,I,F? But S? 

  ""BLESS"": B,L,E,S,S -> letters: B,L,E,S? Then S at the end? And S repeated? But acceptable? 
  But E is in pos3? Which is untested? 

  Compare ""BLESS"" vs ""BELOW""? 
    ""BLESS"": E at pos3, and includes S? Which is common? 
    ""BELOW"": E at pos2? Which is also untested? 

  Since S is common? We might prefer ""BLESS""? 

  How about ""BLUES""? B,L,U,E,S -> E in pos4? But we know E is not in pos4? So avoid? 

  ""BOLES""? B,O,L,E,S -> E in pos4? Again bad? 

  ""BOXES""? B,O,X,E,S -> E in pos4? Same? 

  ""BUSES""? B,U,S,E,S -> E in pos4? Again? 

  ""BASES""? A eliminated? 

  So to have S and E not at the ends? 
    ""SUEDE""? S,U,E,D,E -> E at pos3 and pos5? But pos5 is bad? So duplicate E? 
    But in ""SUEDE"": positions: S1, U2, E3, D4, E5? E is in pos3 and pos5? But we know E not in pos5? So if we guess ""SUEDE"", E at pos5 will be marked incorrectly? But that doesn't help? And we already know? 

  Alternatively, ""SETUP""? S,E,T,U,P -> E in pos2? But T eliminated? 

  With S and E? Position2: perhaps ""LESBO"" invalid? Better skip.

  ""MESSY""? M,E,S,S,Y -> E in pos2? But then S? 

  Actually, ""MESSY"" -> M,E,S,S,Y -> no eliminated letters? Eliminated: A,C,F,H,I,N,R,T? So M,E,S,S,Y -> M, S, Y are okay? And E in pos2? 

  But ""MESSY"" has two S? That might be good? But common? 

  Another: ""JESSY""? Uncommon? 

  But to maximize S? How about ""PRESS""? P,R,E,S,S -> R eliminated? 

  ""DRESS""? D,R,E,S,S -> R eliminated? 

  ""GLESS""? Not word? 

  Therefore, perhaps ""BELOW"" is better? Or ""BLESS""? But ""BLESS"" has E in pos3? 

  Let me try ""BLESS"": B,L,E,S,S -> positions: 1-B, 2-L, 3-E, 4-S, 5-S? Then E is in pos3? Which we haven't tested? 

  Now, ""BLESS"" vs ""BELOW"": which one?

  Both are valid? But ""BLESS"" includes S? And S is more common? 

  Also, ""BLESS"" tests E in pos3? Which is untested? And S? 

  So I think ""BLESS"" might be slightly better? Because S might be in the word? 

  Alternatively, we can consider ""POSED""? P,O,S,E,D -> E in pos4? Avoid.

  Therefore, I choose ""BLESS"".

  But wait: ""BLESS"" has two S? At positions 4 and 5? That might be a problem? But if the secret word has S? It will show accordingly? 

  Actually, I change my mind: ""BLESS"" has double S? Which might be redundant? Since we are trying to get new information? Two S might give feedback for S? But it's the same letter? So will the feedback show for both S? 

  According to the rules: each letter gets a symbol? So if the word has one S and we guess two? Then one S might be marked and the other not? 

  Example: suppose the word has S only once? Then one S might be marked and the other 'x'? 

  This can be messy? 

  Perhaps ""BLED"" isn't 5? 

  How about ""BLUE""? Not 5 letters? 

  Therefore, I think ""BELOW"" is safer? Because it doesn't repeat letters? So we test five distinct letters? 

  ""BELOW"": distinct letters: B,E,L,O,W -> all distinct? Yes.

  Whereas ""BLESS"" has B,L,E,S,S -> letters are B,L,E,S so only four unique? 

  For information gain, distinct letters are better? 

  So let me choose ""BELOW"".

  But wait: another word with E in position1? For example, ""EDGED""? D,G,E,D -> duplicate D and E? Avoid? 

  ""ELD"" not 5.

  ""EBOOK"" not 5.

  ""EMPTY""? M,P,T,Y -> E at pos1? But P,T,Y? T eliminated? T is out? 

  ""EPOXY"": E,P,O,X,Y -> distinct letters? X and Y are uncommon? But acceptable? 

  Compared to ""BELOW"": 
    BELOW: B,E,L,O,W
    EPOXY: E,P,O,X,Y

  Clearly BELOW uses more common letters? So I choose BELOW.

  Thus: third guess: BELOW

  Format: <guess>below</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
**Guess 1: CRANE → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)**  
- ✗ **C, R, A, N**: None of these letters are in the secret word.  
- ➖ **E**: The letter ""E"" is present in the secret word but **not in position 5**.  

**Guess 2: THIEF → Feedback: T(x) H(x) I(x) E(-) F**:  
- ✗ **T, H, I, F**: None of these letters are in the secret word.  
- ➖ **E**: ""E"" is present but **not in position 4**.  

### Key Deductions:
1. **Eliminated Letters**:  
   - Absent: **C, R, A, N, T, H, I, F** (8 letters total).  
   - Valid letters remaining: **B, D, G, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.  

2. **Status of ""E""**:  
   - ""E"" **is** in the secret word.  
   - It cannot be in position 4 or 5 (positions tested in Guesses 1–2).  
   - Therefore, ""E"" **must be in position 1, 2, or 3**.  

3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:  
   - Prioritize words with ""E"" in **untested positions (1, 2, or 3)**.  
   - Use **common remaining letters** to maximize information (e.g., **S, O, L, D, U, M, P**).  
   - Avoid eliminated letters and redundant positions for ""E"".  
   - Given the feedback, a word with ""E"" in position 2 is optimal to test that position succinctly.  

### Selected Guess: **BELOW**  
- **Structure**:  
  - **B**: Position 1 (new letter).  
  - **E**: Position 2 (tests untested position).  
  - **L**: Position 3 (common consonant).  
  - **O**: Position 4 (common vowel).  
  - **W**: Position 5 (new letter).  
- **Advantages**:  
  - Tests ""E"" in position 2 (new position).  
  - Uses 4 new common letters (**B, L, O, W**).  
  - Avoids eliminated letters and emphasizes untested high-frequency consonants/vowels.  
- **Potential Scenarios**:  
  - If ""E"" is in position 2 → ✓ for E (reveals correct position).  
  - If ""E"" is in position 1/3 → ➖ for E (narrows position to 1 or 3).  
  - Feedback on **B, L, O, W** will reveal new information about their presence/positions.  

Proceeding with **BELOW** as the third guess to systematically narrow down possibilities.

It might have more.\n\n But let me think: the word ""STEEL"" has E in position 3 and 4. But we know E is not at position 5? Position 5 is L. \n\n However, we want to test E in a different position? So we can try E at position 1, for instance? How about ""ELBOW""? But O in position 4? And W at the end? Actually, ""ELBOW"": E at position 1.\n\n But we need a 5-letter word: ""ELBOW"" is 5 letters.\n\n But let\'s consider: \n   ""ELBOW"": E, L, B, O, W -> no C,R,A,N. We don\'t know if L, B, O, W are in the word? But we can try.\n\n However, we can also try to cover more frequent letters: T and S are very common.\n\n How about ""STYLE"": S, T, Y, L, E -> E is at position 5? No, position 5: E -> that\'s the same issue.\n\n How about ""LOPES"": O, E -> but E at position 5? \n   ""SPIEL"": S, P, I, E, L -> E at position 4? This works.\n\n Is ""SPIEL"" valid? Yes, it\'s a word meaning a long or important game in sports (or a form of gambling).\n\n Alternative: ""POISE"": P, O, I, S, E -> E at position 5 -> avoid.\n\n Another: ""OWLET"": O, W, L, E, T -> E at position 4 -> acceptable.\n\n But note: in the first guess, all positions except E were wrong. So the word does not have C, R, A, N.\n\n We have to make a guess that includes E and avoids C, R, A, N.\n\n After some thought, let me pick ""THIEF"": T, H, I, E, F -> E at position 4.\n\n Why ""THIEF""? \n   - It has E in position 4 (testing a new position)\n   - It uses T, H, I, F: all common letters.\n\n Alternatively, we could choose ""SLEEP"": S, L, E, E, P -> E in positions 3 and 4? That\'s two E\'s? We don\'t know if duplicate letters are allowed? The rules don\'t say duplicates are forbidden, but the secret word might have duplicates? Actually, Wordle sometimes has duplicate letters? The rules didn\'t specify.\n\n Given our feedback: only one E was shown in the first guess? But we don\'t know if there are duplicates. The feedback for ""crane"" showed E as present but wrong position. That doesn\'t rule out duplicates.\n\n In ""THIEF"", we are testing E at position 4. Also, we are testing T, H, I, F.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose ""SHINE"": S, H, I, N, E -> but wait, we cannot use N? Because N was eliminated? In the first feedback, N was marked ""x"", meaning no N in the word. So we cannot use N.\n\n Therefore, ""SHINE"" is invalid.\n\n Similarly, ""THINE"" has N -> invalid.\n\n So ""THIEF"" seems good.\n\n Another candidate: ""MOVIE"": M, O, V, I, E -> E at position 5 -> avoid.\n\n ""PIXIE"": P, I, X, I, E -> E at position 5? avoid.\n\n ""DOGES"": D, O, G, E, S -> E at position 4? This works. Letters: D, O, G, E, S -> no C,R,A,N.\n\n But G is less common? Maybe we can do better.\n\n Let\'s pick ""STOLE"" if we put E in position 5? But that would be bad because we know E is not at position 5. So we avoid that.\n\n Another: ""STEEL"" has E in positions 3 and 4? And S and T? But S and T are common. Then let me consider ""STEEL"". But that would use two E\'s? It\'s acceptable? And we already avoided C,R,A,N? Yes.\n\n But I prefer a word without duplicates if possible? Because duplicates are less common? And we can get more information if we try five distinct letters? But THIEF doesn\'t have duplicates? Yes, THIEF is distinct.\n\n Alternatively, ""SLEEK"" -> E at positions 3 and 4? But then we are testing E in two positions? \n\n Considering efficiency, I think ""THIEF"" is a good choice.\n\n Another word: ""OILED"": O, I, L, E, D -> E at position 4. Avoids C,R,A,N. Distinct letters.\n\n Or ""FIELD"": F, I, E, L, D -> E at position 3.\n\n Why FIELD? E at position 3.\n\n However, in the first word ""crane"", E was at position 5 and that was wrong. Now putting E at position 3? We are testing in a different position.\n\n Actually, we don\'t know where E is, so any position (1-4) is possible.\n\n I think we\'ll go with ""THIEF"".\n\n Steps:\n   We include E and put it at position 4.\n   We avoid C,R,A,N.\n   We choose T, H, I, F: common letters.\n\n Let me check: T is very common, H common, I common vowel, F less common but acceptable.\n\n If I\'m concerned about F, we might choose a word with L or S? But ""THIEF"" has S? No, it has T, H, I, E, F.\n\n Another word: ""WHITE"": W, H, I, T, E -> E at position 5 -> avoid.\n\n ""SHITE"" -> invalid? Or vulgar? Avoid. \n\n ""POSSE"" -> E at the end? Avoid.\n\n ""BREAD"" -> has R and A? Eliminated.\n\n So ""THIEF"" is acceptable.\n\n Therefore, my second guess is ""THIEF"". \n\n Important: the response format must be <guess>thief</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- ✓: None (no correct positions)\n- -: E (present but not in position 5)\n- x: C, R, A, N (not in the word at all)\n\nKey deductions:\n1. The secret word contains ""E"" but not in the last position (positions 1–4 possible).\n2. Letters C, R, A, N are eliminated entirely.\n3. The next guess must:\n   - Include ""E"" in positions 1–4.\n   - Avoid C, R, A, N.\n   - Use new common letters to maximize information (e.g., S, T, L, O, I, D).\n\nSelected guess: **""thief""**  \n- Places ""E"" in position 4 (testing a new position).\n- Uses common letters: T, H, I, F (all untested).\n- Valid 5-letter word avoiding eliminated letters.\n\n<guess>thief</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: thief -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) I(x) E(-) F(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are on the third guess.

Only E so far. But we have eliminated many letters.\n\nAlso, we know the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, T, H, I, F.\n\nWe need to think of a new word that:\n- Includes E in position 1, 2, or 3 (since positions 4 and 5 are invalid for E).\n- Avoids the eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, T, H, I, F.\n- Uses common remaining letters.\n\nWhat letters remain? The alphabet minus the eliminated ones.\n\nEliminated letters: A, C, F, H, I, N, R, T. That\'s 8 letters.\n\nRemaining letters: B, D, G, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nCommon letters among these: S, O, L, D, U, M, P, etc.\n\nWe need to find a 5-letter word with E in position 1, 2, or 3, and using the remaining letters.\n\nAlso, since E is possibly in position 1,2, or 3, we might want to test multiple positions? But we can only place E in one position per guess.\n\nLet\'s think: we can try to put E in position 1 to test if it\'s there? Or in position 2? Or 3?\n\nMoreover, we need to cover as many new common letters as possible.\n\nLet me list possible words:\n\n- Position 1: E ...\n  Words: E.g., ""EOSIN"" - but O is okay? But ""EOSIN"" isn\'t common. \n  ""ELOPS""? Not common.\n  More common: ""EPOXY""? Has P, O, X, Y -> but X and Y are less common? \n  ""EBOOK""? Not 5 letters.\n\n  Better: ""SPELT"" - but T is eliminated? T is in eliminated list.\n\n  Avoiding T, etc.\n\n  How about ""EDGES""? E in pos1, but then D,G,E,S -> but E repeated? And G is okay? \n  But note: ""EDGES"" has two E\'s? First E and last E? But last E: position 5? But we know E is not in pos5? We know E is in the word but not in pos5? So if we use E in pos5, it will be marked wrong? But our goal is to find the word, not avoid known wrong positions? Actually, we shouldn\'t waste positions.\n\n  Alternatively, ""EUPES""? Not a word.\n\n  Let me think of better words: ""EMBUS""? Not common.\n\n  Perhaps position 2 might be better?\n\n- Position 2: ... E ...\n\n  Words: ""LEMES""? Not good.\n    ""BEVEL""? B,E,V,E,L -> two E\'s? And V? \n    ""LEVEL""? Also two E\'s and L? But L is okay? And V? \n    ""LEGES""? Not common.\n\n  Common words: \n    ""BELOW"": B,E,L,O,W -> E in pos2 -> avoids eliminated letters. And B,L,O,W are new.\n    ""DELVE"": D,E,L,V,E -> two E\'s? V is okay? But V is less common? \n    ""HELPS""? H eliminated? No, H is eliminated? H is in eliminated list? Yes.\n\n  Without eliminated? ""BELOW"" seems good: letters B,E,L,O,W -> none of the eliminated? \n    Eliminated: A,C,F,H,I,N,R,T -> so B,L,O,W are okay.\n\n- Position 3: ... E ...\n  Words: ""MODEM""? M,O,D,E,M -> two M\'s? And E in pos4? Wait, M-O-D-E-M: positions 1-M, 2-O, 3-D, 4-E, 5-M? Then E in pos4? But we already know E is not in pos4? So that\'s bad? But in this word, E is at 4? We should avoid putting E in pos4 because we know it\'s not there.\n\n  Correct word: we need E in pos3? So something like: _ _ E _ _\n\n  Example: ""OWEES""? Not common.\n    ""STEEL"" -> S,T,E,E,L -> but T is eliminated? And E at pos3 and pos4? And T is bad? Eliminated?\n    ""BLEED"" -> B,L,E,E,D -> E at pos3 and pos4? But we know E cannot be at pos4? So in ""BLEED"", if we put E at pos3 and pos4, then pos4 will be wrong? And also L,B,D are new? \n    But we are allowed to test, but note: if the word does not have duplicate E, then having E at pos3 might help? But we don\'t know?\n\n  Actually, ""BELOW"" seems like a good candidate because it uses common letters: B,L,O,W and E at position 2.\n\n  Also, ""MOVED"": M,O,V,E,D -> E in pos4? Avoid because pos4 is bad for E? We know E is not in pos4? So putting E in pos4 would definitely get marked as \'-\'? Since we know E is present? But the feedback would show E as \'-\', which we already know? So that is redundant? Worse, we lose the chance to test a new position.\n\n  Therefore, choosing a word with E in an untested position? We have tested E at pos5 and pos4? So untested: pos1,2,3.\n\n  We\'ve tested: pos5 (guess1) and pos4 (guess2) -> both were wrong? So we should test E at pos1,2, or 3? \n\n  Let me prioritize common words: \n    ""BELOW"": E in pos2 -> position we haven\'t tested? So if E is at pos2, we might get ✓ for E? If not, and we got \'-\', then we know E can\'t be at pos2? Or if we put E at pos2 and we get -, that would be bad because we expect E to be at pos2? Actually, no: the \'-\' means it\'s in the word but not in that position? Which we already know? So we expect that unless pos2 is correct.\n\n  Actually, if we put E in pos2 and the word has E at pos2? Then we get ✓? Else, if it has E at pos1, pos3, etc., we get \'-\'? So yes, testing E at pos2 will tell us if it is in pos2? Or not? If not, then E must be in pos1 or pos3? Since we know pos4 and pos5 are wrong.\n\n  Therefore, ""BELOW"" is a good candidate? And it has B, L, O, W? All new letters? And common? \n\n  Common letters? L and O are common? B and W less so? But acceptable.\n\n  Another option: ""SELFS""? Not valid? S,E,L,F,S -> F eliminated? Oh, F is eliminated? From guess2: F(x) -> so F is out.\n\n  Similarly, ""SELES""? Maybe? S,E,L,E,S -> two S and two E? E in pos2? And S? But S is okay? But then we have duplicate? \n\n  How about ""SOLVE""? S,O,L,V,E -> E in pos5? Avoid pos5? \n\n  ""POSSE""? P,O,S,S,E -> E in pos5? Avoid.\n\n  ""BESOM""? B,E,S,O,M -> E in pos2? Same as BELOW? And letters S,O,M? More common? \n\n  ""BESOM""? That\'s a word? BESOM: a broom made of twigs. So valid? Alternatively, ""BLEBS""? Not common? \n\n  But ""BELOW"" is more common? \n\n  Also, ""BELOW"": word meaning underneath.\n\n  So let me pick ""BELOW""? \n\n  Another candidate: ""DEMES""? Not common? \n\n  Perhaps ""LEMONS""? Not 5 letters? \n\n  How about ""OGLED""? O,G,L,E,D -> E in pos4? We know E not in pos4? So avoid? \n\n  Therefore, let me go with ""BELOW"".\n\n  We\'ll use ""BELOW"": \n    Position1: B\n    Position2: E\n    Position3: L\n    Position4: O\n    Position5: W\n\n  We are testing:\n    E at position2? If it becomes ✓, then we know E is at 2? Else, if \'-\'? Then we know E is not at 2? But we already know E is present? So if \'-\' we know E is at 1 or 3? \n    Also, we test B, L, O, W? \n\n  Now, the response: after this, we\'ll get feedback? \n\n  So our third guess: BELOW.\n\n  But note: we are not using S? But S is a very common letter. Maybe we could use a word with S? \n\n  Is there a word with E in position1, 2, or 3 and S? And without eliminated letters?\n\n  For example: \n    Position1: E and then S? E.g., ""EOSIN"" invalid? \n    Position2: ...E... with S? ""DESKS"" -> D,E,S,K,S -> but K and S? Or ""MESAS""? M,E,S,A,S -> A eliminated? A is eliminated? \n    ""YESES"" -> Y,E,S,E,S? \n    Position3: ...E... with S? ""BLESS"" -> B,L,E,S,S? E in pos3? And B,L,E,S? Avoids eliminated? No H,I,F? But S? \n\n  ""BLESS"": B,L,E,S,S -> letters: B,L,E,S? Then S at the end? And S repeated? But acceptable? \n  But E is in pos3? Which is untested? \n\n  Compare ""BLESS"" vs ""BELOW""? \n    ""BLESS"": E at pos3, and includes S? Which is common? \n    ""BELOW"": E at pos2? Which is also untested? \n\n  Since S is common? We might prefer ""BLESS""? \n\n  How about ""BLUES""? B,L,U,E,S -> E in pos4? But we know E is not in pos4? So avoid? \n\n  ""BOLES""? B,O,L,E,S -> E in pos4? Again bad? \n\n  ""BOXES""? B,O,X,E,S -> E in pos4? Same? \n\n  ""BUSES""? B,U,S,E,S -> E in pos4? Again? \n\n  ""BASES""? A eliminated? \n\n  So to have S and E not at the ends? \n    ""SUEDE""? S,U,E,D,E -> E at pos3 and pos5? But pos5 is bad? So duplicate E? \n    But in ""SUEDE"": positions: S1, U2, E3, D4, E5? E is in pos3 and pos5? But we know E not in pos5? So if we guess ""SUEDE"", E at pos5 will be marked incorrectly? But that doesn\'t help? And we already know? \n\n  Alternatively, ""SETUP""? S,E,T,U,P -> E in pos2? But T eliminated? \n\n  With S and E? Position2: perhaps ""LESBO"" invalid? Better skip.\n\n  ""MESSY""? M,E,S,S,Y -> E in pos2? But then S? \n\n  Actually, ""MESSY"" -> M,E,S,S,Y -> no eliminated letters? Eliminated: A,C,F,H,I,N,R,T? So M,E,S,S,Y -> M, S, Y are okay? And E in pos2? \n\n  But ""MESSY"" has two S? That might be good? But common? \n\n  Another: ""JESSY""? Uncommon? \n\n  But to maximize S? How about ""PRESS""? P,R,E,S,S -> R eliminated? \n\n  ""DRESS""? D,R,E,S,S -> R eliminated? \n\n  ""GLESS""? Not word? \n\n  Therefore, perhaps ""BELOW"" is better? Or ""BLESS""? But ""BLESS"" has E in pos3? \n\n  Let me try ""BLESS"": B,L,E,S,S -> positions: 1-B, 2-L, 3-E, 4-S, 5-S? Then E is in pos3? Which we haven\'t tested? \n\n  Now, ""BLESS"" vs ""BELOW"": which one?\n\n  Both are valid? But ""BLESS"" includes S? And S is more common? \n\n  Also, ""BLESS"" tests E in pos3? Which is untested? And S? \n\n  So I think ""BLESS"" might be slightly better? Because S might be in the word? \n\n  Alternatively, we can consider ""POSED""? P,O,S,E,D -> E in pos4? Avoid.\n\n  Therefore, I choose ""BLESS"".\n\n  But wait: ""BLESS"" has two S? At positions 4 and 5? That might be a problem? But if the secret word has S? It will show accordingly? \n\n  Actually, I change my mind: ""BLESS"" has double S? Which might be redundant? Since we are trying to get new information? Two S might give feedback for S? But it\'s the same letter? So will the feedback show for both S? \n\n  According to the rules: each letter gets a symbol? So if the word has one S and we guess two? Then one S might be marked and the other not? \n\n  Example: suppose the word has S only once? Then one S might be marked and the other \'x\'? \n\n  This can be messy? \n\n  Perhaps ""BLED"" isn\'t 5? \n\n  How about ""BLUE""? Not 5 letters? \n\n  Therefore, I think ""BELOW"" is safer? Because it doesn\'t repeat letters? So we test five distinct letters? \n\n  ""BELOW"": distinct letters: B,E,L,O,W -> all distinct? Yes.\n\n  Whereas ""BLESS"" has B,L,E,S,S -> letters are B,L,E,S so only four unique? \n\n  For information gain, distinct letters are better? \n\n  So let me choose ""BELOW"".\n\n  But wait: another word with E in position1? For example, ""EDGED""? D,G,E,D -> duplicate D and E? Avoid? \n\n  ""ELD"" not 5.\n\n  ""EBOOK"" not 5.\n\n  ""EMPTY""? M,P,T,Y -> E at pos1? But P,T,Y? T eliminated? T is out? \n\n  ""EPOXY"": E,P,O,X,Y -> distinct letters? X and Y are uncommon? But acceptable? \n\n  Compared to ""BELOW"": \n    BELOW: B,E,L,O,W\n    EPOXY: E,P,O,X,Y\n\n  Clearly BELOW uses more common letters? So I choose BELOW.\n\n  Thus: third guess: BELOW\n\n  Format: <guess>below</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n**Guess 1: CRANE → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)**  \n- ✗ **C, R, A, N**: None of these letters are in the secret word.  \n- ➖ **E**: The letter ""E"" is present in the secret word but **not in position 5**.  \n\n**Guess 2: THIEF → Feedback: T(x) H(x) I(x) E(-) F**:  \n- ✗ **T, H, I, F**: None of these letters are in the secret word.  \n- ➖ **E**: ""E"" is present but **not in position 4**.  \n\n### Key Deductions:\n1. **Eliminated Letters**:  \n   - Absent: **C, R, A, N, T, H, I, F** (8 letters total).  \n   - Valid letters remaining: **B, D, G, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.  \n\n2. **Status of ""E""**:  \n   - ""E"" **is** in the secret word.  \n   - It cannot be in position 4 or 5 (positions tested in Guesses 1–2).  \n   - Therefore, ""E"" **must be in position 1, 2, or 3**.  \n\n3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:  \n   - Prioritize words with ""E"" in **untested positions (1, 2, or 3)**.  \n   - Use **common remaining letters** to maximize information (e.g., **S, O, L, D, U, M, P**).  \n   - Avoid eliminated letters and redundant positions for ""E"".  \n   - Given the feedback, a word with ""E"" in position 2 is optimal to test that position succinctly.  \n\n### Selected Guess: **BELOW**  \n- **Structure**:  \n  - **B**: Position 1 (new letter).  \n  - **E**: Position 2 (tests untested position).  \n  - **L**: Position 3 (common consonant).  \n  - **O**: Position 4 (common vowel).  \n  - **W**: Position 5 (new letter).  \n- **Advantages**:  \n  - Tests ""E"" in position 2 (new position).  \n  - Uses 4 new common letters (**B, L, O, W**).  \n  - Avoids eliminated letters and emphasizes untested high-frequency consonants/vowels.  \n- **Potential Scenarios**:  \n  - If ""E"" is in position 2 → ✓ for E (reveals correct position).  \n  - If ""E"" is in position 1/3 → ➖ for E (narrows position to 1 or 3).  \n  - Feedback on **B, L, O, W** will reveal new information about their presence/positions.  \n\nProceeding with **BELOW** as the third guess to systematically narrow down possibilities.\n\n<guess>below</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: thief -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) I(x) E(-) F(x)\nGuess 3: below -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(-) L(-) O(x) W(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are on the fourth guess. Previous feedback:

Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: thief -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) I(x) E(-) F(x)
Guess 3: below -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(-) L(-) O(x) W(x)

From guess 3 ""below"": 
- B(x) -> B is not in the word.
- E(-) -> E is in the word but not in position 2 (since E is at pos2 in ""below"").
- L(-) -> L is in the word but not in position 3 (since L is at pos3 in ""below"").
- O(x) -> O is not in the word.
- W(x) -> W is not in the word.

So, summarizing knowns:

From all feedback:

Eliminated letters (marked x in any guess): 
  Guess1: C, R, A, N
  Guess2: T, H, I, F
  Guess3: B, O, W
  Total eliminated: C, R, A, N, T, H, I, F, B, O, W

Also from Guess3: L is in the word (because L got ""-""), but not in position 3.

From Guess1: E is in the word, not pos5.
From Guess2: E is in the word, not pos4.
From Guess3: E is in the word, not pos2.

So E must be in position 1 or 3? Let's see:

Positions E cannot be:
- Guess1: not pos5 (E was at pos5)
- Guess2: not pos4 (E was at pos4)
- Guess3: not pos2 (E was at pos2)

Therefore, E must be in position 1 or 3? Because positions 2,4,5 are excluded? There are only 5 positions.

Also, we know L is in the word, and not in position 3 (from guess3).

What else? We have two known letters: E and L? And we know E is in pos1 or 3? And L is in pos1,2,4, or5? But not pos3.

Let me list what we know:

Present letters (marked '-' at least once):
- E: present, not in pos2,4,5 -> so must be in pos1 or3.
- L: present, not in pos3.

We also have other letters in the word? We don't know? We haven't found them yet.

Now, what letters are available? We need to pick from the remaining alphabet without eliminated letters.

Eliminated: A,B,C,F,H,I,N,O,R,T,W -> also add from guess3: B,O,W? Which are already listed.

List of eliminated letters: 
  A, B, C, F, H, I, N, O, R, T, W

And we have used: in guesses, we have also used E,L and others? But we don't know all present?

The remaining letters: D, G, J, K, M, P, Q, S, U, V, X, Y, Z

Common letters: D, G, M, P, S, U, V, Y

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Must include E (in pos1 or3) and L (not in pos3? and in some position).
- And three other letters from the available set.

Moreover, the word must place E at position 1 or 3? Because those are the only possibilities? 

Two cases:

Case A: E at position 1
Then the word: E _ _ _ _

But L must be in the word? And L cannot be at pos3? So L must be at pos2,4, or5.

Case B: E at position 3
Then the word: _ _ E _ _

But L must be in the word? And L cannot be at pos3? But if E is at pos3, then L cannot be at pos3 anyway? So L would be at pos1,2,4,5.

But note: if E is at pos3, that would conflict? No? Because E at pos3 and L cannot be at pos3? So that's fine? 

However, we have L present? So regardless.

Now, which case should we test? We need to design a guess that helps us distinguish.

Perhaps we can design a word that works in both cases? Or pick one?

Given we have limited tries (this is the fourth guess), we should aim to confirm the position of E? 

How? If we guess a word with E at position 1:
  If we get E(✓) for position1, then we know E is at1? And if we get E(-) then we know E is at position3? So we can test.

Similarly, if we guess E at position3: 
  If we get E(✓) then at pos3? If E(-) then E must be at pos1.

Therefore, whatever guess we make, if we put E at one of the possible positions, the feedback will tell us? 

So let's pick a word that places E at position1? Or position3? And includes L? And uses other common letters.

Also, since L is present? We haven't confirmed its position? So we need to place L in a position that is still possible? And if we get feedback, we can learn about L.

But L cannot be at pos3? So avoid pos3 for L? 

Now, available letters: D,G,J,K,M,P,Q,S,U,V,X,Y,Z

Common: D,S,M,P,G,U,V

We need to pick E and L? And three others? 

Also, the word must be valid.

Try E at position1? 

Possible words: 
  E _ _ L _ -> but not necessarily? We can put L wherever? As long as not pos3.

Example: ""EDGED""? Not? Double E? And G,D? But D? But eliminated? No D is available? But ""EDGED"" has two D? And E at1 and L? Doesn't have L? 

Must include L? Yes? Because we know L is present? 

So the word must have E and L? 

So for position1: E and then include L.

Possible: E, L, and three letters from available? 

How about ""ELMSY""? Not word? 

""ELM"" is 3? 

""ELUDE"": E,U,D,E -> but E repeated? Also U,D? 
  ELUDE: E(1),L(2),U(3),D(4),E(5) -> but E at5? We know E cannot be at5? So ""ELUDE"" has E at1 and5? But we know E is not at5? So if we guess ""ELUDE"", then pos5 E will be wrong? 

Avoid? 

""ELOPS""? Not common? 

Another: ""ELOGE""? Not word? 

But wait: we must avoid O? O eliminated? Yes? So we can't use O? 

How about ""ELDER"": E,L,D,E,R -> but R eliminated? 

""EMPTY"": E,M,P,T,Y -> T eliminated? 

""ELVES"": E,L,V,E,S -> E repeated? And S? But E at pos1 and pos4? But we know E not at pos4 (previous)? So put E at pos4? Will be known wrong? 

Alternatively, E at pos3? Words: _ _ E _ _

With L included? And avoiding pos3 for L? But E at pos3? So L elsewhere? 

How about ""PLACE"": P,L,A,C,E -> A and C eliminated? 

""FLIES"": F,L,I,E,S -> F and I eliminated? 

""GLUEY"": G,L,U,E,Y -> L at pos2? E at pos4? But we know E not at pos4? 

Then ""SLED"" not 5? 

""MOVED"": M,O,V,E,D -> O eliminated? 

Therefore, let me think of words with E at pos1? 

""ELVES"" is not word? Actually, ""ELVES"" is valid? E1, L2, V3, E4, S5? But E at4 is bad? Because we know E not at pos4? So S5? 

But we know E must be at1 or3? So putting E at1? In ""ELVES"", E is at1? And E at4? Position4? That's not allowed? We know E not at4? So if the word has E at1 and4, we are putting E at4? Which should be incorrect? 

We could avoid redundant E? We don't know if the word has duplicate E? But to prevent waste, avoid putting E in positions we already know are wrong? 

Ideal: a word with E at position1? And L at another position (2,4,5)? And other letters? 

Possible words: 
  ""ELMSY"" invalid?
  ""ELD"" not 5? 

  ""ELMUD""? Not word? 

Better: ""ELSH"" not? 

With S? ""ELSIN""? E,L,S,I,N -> I and N eliminated? 

Therefore, perhaps E at pos3? 

Try position3: E? 

Possible word: _ _ E _ _

With L: place L at pos1,2,4,5? But avoid pos3? 

And other letters? 

Example: ""PLEDE""? P,L,E,D,E -> but D and E? And E at pos3 and5? pos5 bad? 

""GLEDE""? G,L,E,D,E -> same? 

""SLESE""? Not word? 

""STEEL""? S,T,E,E,L -> T eliminated? 

""SKEEP""? Not common? 

Another: ""QUELL""? Q,U,E,L,L -> E at pos3? Yes? Positions: Q1, U2, E3, L4, L5? 

But L at pos4 and5? And U? 

Also, Q is less common? 

But it has E at pos3? And L at pos4 and5? 

But can we use Q? 

Alternatively, ""GUESS""? G,U,E,S,S -> E at pos3? Positions: G1,U2,E3,S4,S5? But no L? We did not include L? 

We must include L? Yes? Because we need to test L? But we can't? Actually, we have L present? But if we don't include L? Then feedback would show that? But we know L is in the word? So if we guess without L, we get L missing? But we already know L is present? So it would be better to include L? 

We need to cover L? So all guesses must include L? Until we have it located? 

Similarly for E? 

So yes? 

So for E at pos3, word must have L? 

Possible words: 
  ""ALLEY"" -> A eliminated? 
  ""BLEED"" -> B eliminated? 
  ""CLEEK"" -> C eliminated? 
  ""DLEEK"" not word? 
  ""FLEET"" -> F eliminated? 
  ""GLEED""? G,L,E,E,D -> E repeated? But E at pos3? Also D? 
    GLEED is valid? An alternative spelling of GLEE? But usually 4? 
  ""HELIO"" -> H eliminated? 
  ""ILEAC"" -> I eliminated? 

So hard? 

How about ""LUPES""? L,U,P,E,S -> E at pos4? Bad? 

""LUEMS""? Not word? 

Another: ""MELD"" not 5? Meld is 4? 

But ""MELDY"" not word? 

""PELFS"" not? 

""QUELS"" -> Q,U,E,L,S? L at pos4? E at pos3? 

Position: Q1,U2,E3,L4,S5? 

Letters: Q,U,E,L,S? Avoids eliminated? Eliminated? A,B,C,F,H,I,N,O,R,T,W? So Q,U,E,L,S are okay? 

But Q is rare? But we need a word? 

So ""QUELS"" is valid? Meaning of quel? 

But better? S something? 

How about ""SLEEK""? S,L,E,E,K -> E at pos3? And L at pos2? E repeated? 

Positions: S1,L2,E3,E4,K5? But E at pos4? Which is wrong? But we put E at pos4? We know E not at pos4? So that would be bad? 

Similarly, ""SLYPE"" -> S,L,Y,P,E? E? at pos5? Bad? 

Therefore, we can choose ""QUELS"".

But I think E at pos1 might be better? Because more words? 

Let's try E at pos1? 

Possible: ""ELD"" not 5? 

""ELM"" not 5? 

""ELKSY"" not? 

""ELPSY"" not? 

""JELAB"" not? 

""KELTS""? K,E,L,T,S -> T eliminated? 

""LEMEL"" L,E,M,E,L -> but L and E and M? Positions: L1,E2,M3,E4,L5? 
  But note: L is at pos1 and5? And E at pos2? But we know E not at pos2? From below? Guess3 showed E at pos2? Got '-'? Meaning not at pos2? So if we guess with E at pos2? We'll get '-' again? 

But we are placing L at pos1 and5? And E at pos2? 

But E at pos2? We already know it is not there? Because of previous feedback? So the E at pos2 will be marked as '-', which we know? So it doesn't help? 

Similarly, if we put E at pos1? Then that might be good? But at pos2? Bad? 

For a word with E at pos1? And no other E? 

Example: ""EDGES""? E at1 and E at4? Bad? 

""ELANS"" -> A and N eliminated? 

""EMBUS""? E1,M2,B3,U4,S5? But B eliminated? 

""EMMET""? E at1 and E at4? Bad? 

""ENOKI"" -> N and O? N eliminated? 

Therefore, perhaps we have to use less common letters? 

""EPHOD"" -> E1,P2,H3,O4,D5? But H and O eliminated? 

""EPACT"" -> A and T? Eliminated? 

""ERUVS"" -> R eliminated? 

""ESKAR"" -> A eliminated? 

""EXULS"" not? 

""EYASS"" not? 

Then ""ELVEN"": E1,L2,V3,E4,N5? N eliminated? and E at4? Bad? 

But N eliminated? So no? 

""ELVIS"": E1,L2,V3,I4,S5? But I eliminated? 

""EKING"": E1,K2,I3,N4,G5? I and N eliminated? 

""EMYDES"" not 5? 

Therefore, perhaps E at pos3 is unavoidable? We might need to guess a word with E at pos3? And L at pos1,2,4 or5? 

Ideal: ""SMELL"": S1, M2, E3, L4, L5 -> letters S,M,E,L? And L repeated? But M and S are common? 

But ""SMELL""? Valid? And avoids eliminated letters? 

Letters: S,M,E,L,L? Eliminated letters: none of these are eliminated? 
  Eliminated: A,B,C,F,H,I,N,O,R,T,W? So S,M,E,L are okay? 

Also, E at pos3? Which we haven't tested? 

L positions: pos4 and5? And L cannot be at pos3? Which is fine. 

We don't know if L can be at 4 or5? 

But this guess? 

If we guess ""SMELL"", then:
  If E at pos3: then E gets ✓? 
  And L is present? But L is at pos4 and5? If the word has one L, then one L might be marked correctly? 

But since we know L is present? The feedback will show it. 

Alternatively, ""MELKS""? M1,E2,L3,K4,S5 -> L is at pos3? But we know L cannot be at pos3! From guess3: L got '-' meaning it is in the word but not at pos3? So if we put L at pos3? We will get '-' at least? For L at pos3? 

So in ""MELKS"", E at pos2? Which we already know not? We also know E not at pos2? 

Therefore, avoid: 

"" Also, L at pos3? Not allowed.

So how about ""SLEDS""? S,L,E,D,S -> L at pos2? E at pos3? D and S? But D? 
  Positions: S1,L2,E3,D4,S5? 
  E at pos3? L at pos2? Avoiding L at pos3? 

But we have S? And D? 

But in ""SLEDS"", it ends with S5? 

Valid word? ""SLEDS"" is plural of sled? 

Yes? 

And avoid eliminated letters? 

Letters: S,L,E,D,S -> S and E, D? 

Eliminated: none of these? 

But S repeated? 

Alternatively, with only one S? ""SLED"" not 5? 

Or ""SLEDE"" archaic? 

But ""SLEDS"" is acceptable? 

Another option: ""GLED"" not 5? 

So far, ""SLEDS"" and ""SLED"": but ""SLEDS"" is 5? 

Or ""BUMS  not? 

""SET ""not?

""SLED"" plus S? 

But I will choose ""SLEDS"" but it has two S? But that might be okay? We will see the feedback? 

Also, ""SMELL"" might be a better choice? Because it has M? But ""SMELL"" has L at pos4 and5? And E at pos3? 

And letters S and M? Common? 

Whereas ""SLEDS"" has S at1 and5? And D? 

But ""SMELL"" has E at pos3? Which is good? And L at4 and5? 

But feedback: for L, since it is at two positions, and the word might have one or two L? But we know L is present? 

After reconsideration, let's go with ""SMELT"". But ""SMELT"" has T? T eliminated? 

No? 

How about ""SPELL"". S1,P2,E3,L4,L5? P is available? ""SPELL"": S,P,E,L? 

This seems good? 

""SPELL"": 
  S at1, P at2, E at3, L at4, L at5?

E at3? P2? S1? L4,L5? 

And avoids eliminated letters? 

Yes? Letters: S,P,E,L? 

And E at position3? L at4 and5? 

So this works? 

But L cannot be at pos3? What about in ""SPELL"", no L at pos3? 

Also, E at3? 

So guess: SPELL

But in ""SPELL"", L is repeated? But we can still guess it? 

I think this is valid? 

""SPELL"" is a valid English word? 

Yes? 

So let's use ""SPELL"" as the fourth guess.

So our fourth guess: SPELL

Format: <guess>spell</guess> 

But let's recap:
  E at position3? If E is in the word at pos3, we get ✓? If not, we get '-'? Then E must be at pos1? 

  Also, L at pos4 and5? But feedback will show how L matches? 

We might waste a position because of duplicate L? But it's okay? 

Alternatively, is there a word with E at pos3 and L without duplication? 

For example, ""SOLVS""? No? 

""ULZEN"" not word? 

Therefore, ""SPELL"" is acceptable.

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
**Guess 1: CRANE → FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)**  
- ✗ C, R, A, N: Eliminated.  
- ➖ E: Present, but not in position 5.

**Guess 2: THIEF → FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) I(x) E(-) F(x)**  
- ✗ T, H, I, F: Eliminated.  
- ➖ E: Present, but not in position 4.

**Guess 3: BELOW → FEEDBACK: B(x) E(-) L(-) O(x) W(x)**  
- ✗ B, O, W: Eliminated.  
- ➖ E: Present, but not in position 2.  
- ➖ L: Present, but not in position 3.

### Key Deductions:
1. **Eliminated Letters**: A, B, C, F, H, I, N, O, R, T, W.  
   - Remaining valid letters: **D, G, J, K, M, P, Q, S, U, V, X, Y, Z**.

2. **Definitive Presence**:  
   - **E**: Must be in the word. Positions 2, 4, and 5 are invalid (tested). **Only positions 1 or 3 are possible**.  
   - **L**: Must be in the word. Position 3 is invalid (tested). Possible positions: 1, 2, 4, or 5.

3. **Strategy for Guess 4**:  
   - Prioritize placing **E in position 3** to test this untested position.  
     - If E is ✓, position 3 is correct.  
     - If E is ➖, E must be in position 1.  
   - **Position L away from position 3** (confirmed invalid). Placed in position 4/5.  
   - Use **common remaining letters** (S, P, D, U, M) for coverage.  
   - The word **SPELL** is chosen:  
     - E at position 3 (tests untested slot).  
     - L at position 4/5 (tests possible positions with redundancy).  
     - S and P are high-frequency letters.  
     - Avoids all eliminated letters.  

### Selected Guess: **SPELL**  
- **Structure**:  
  - Position 1: **S** (common)  
  - Position 2: **P** (common)  
  - Position 3: **E** (critical test for position)  
  - Position 4: **L** (presence confirmed, tests position)  
  - Position 5: **L** (redundant placement; reveals if L repeats or clarifies position)  

<guess>spell</guess>",spell,"We are on the fourth guess. Previous feedback:

Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: thief -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) I(x) E(-) F(x)
Guess 3: below -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(-) L(-) O(x) W(x)

From guess 3 ""below"": 
- B(x) -> B is not in the word.
- E(-) -> E is in the word but not in position 2 (since E is at pos2 in ""below"").
- L(-) -> L is in the word but not in position 3 (since L is at pos3 in ""below"").
- O(x) -> O is not in the word.
- W(x) -> W is not in the word.

So, summarizing knowns:

From all feedback:

Eliminated letters (marked x in any guess): 
  Guess1: C, R, A, N
  Guess2: T, H, I, F
  Guess3: B, O, W
  Total eliminated: C, R, A, N, T, H, I, F, B, O, W

Also from Guess3: L is in the word (because L got ""-""), but not in position 3.

From Guess1: E is in the word, not pos5.
From Guess2: E is in the word, not pos4.
From Guess3: E is in the word, not pos2.

So E must be in position 1 or 3? Let's see:

Positions E cannot be:
- Guess1: not pos5 (E was at pos5)
- Guess2: not pos4 (E was at pos4)
- Guess3: not pos2 (E was at pos2)

Therefore, E must be in position 1 or 3? Because positions 2,4,5 are excluded? There are only 5 positions.

Also, we know L is in the word, and not in position 3 (from guess3).

What else? We have two known letters: E and L? And we know E is in pos1 or 3? And L is in pos1,2,4, or5? But not pos3.

Let me list what we know:

Present letters (marked '-' at least once):
- E: present, not in pos2,4,5 -> so must be in pos1 or3.
- L: present, not in pos3.

We also have other letters in the word? We don't know? We haven't found them yet.

Now, what letters are available? We need to pick from the remaining alphabet without eliminated letters.

Eliminated: A,B,C,F,H,I,N,O,R,T,W -> also add from guess3: B,O,W? Which are already listed.

List of eliminated letters: 
  A, B, C, F, H, I, N, O, R, T, W

And we have used: in guesses, we have also used E,L and others? But we don't know all present?

The remaining letters: D, G, J, K, M, P, Q, S, U, V, X, Y, Z

Common letters: D, G, M, P, S, U, V, Y

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Must include E (in pos1 or3) and L (not in pos3? and in some position).
- And three other letters from the available set.

Moreover, the word must place E at position 1 or 3? Because those are the only possibilities? 

Two cases:

Case A: E at position 1
Then the word: E _ _ _ _

But L must be in the word? And L cannot be at pos3? So L must be at pos2,4, or5.

Case B: E at position 3
Then the word: _ _ E _ _

But L must be in the word? And L cannot be at pos3? But if E is at pos3, then L cannot be at pos3 anyway? So L would be at pos1,2,4,5.

But note: if E is at pos3, that would conflict? No? Because E at pos3 and L cannot be at pos3? So that's fine? 

However, we have L present? So regardless.

Now, which case should we test? We need to design a guess that helps us distinguish.

Perhaps we can design a word that works in both cases? Or pick one?

Given we have limited tries (this is the fourth guess), we should aim to confirm the position of E? 

How? If we guess a word with E at position 1:
  If we get E(✓) for position1, then we know E is at1? And if we get E(-) then we know E is at position3? So we can test.

Similarly, if we guess E at position3: 
  If we get E(✓) then at pos3? If E(-) then E must be at pos1.

Therefore, whatever guess we make, if we put E at one of the possible positions, the feedback will tell us? 

So let's pick a word that places E at position1? Or position3? And includes L? And uses other common letters.

Also, since L is present? We haven't confirmed its position? So we need to place L in a position that is still possible? And if we get feedback, we can learn about L.

But L cannot be at pos3? So avoid pos3 for L? 

Now, available letters: D,G,J,K,M,P,Q,S,U,V,X,Y,Z

Common: D,S,M,P,G,U,V

We need to pick E and L? And three others? 

Also, the word must be valid.

Try E at position1? 

Possible words: 
  E _ _ L _ -> but not necessarily? We can put L wherever? As long as not pos3.

Example: ""EDGED""? Not? Double E? And G,D? But D? But eliminated? No D is available? But ""EDGED"" has two D? And E at1 and L? Doesn't have L? 

Must include L? Yes? Because we know L is present? 

So the word must have E and L? 

So for position1: E and then include L.

Possible: E, L, and three letters from available? 

How about ""ELMSY""? Not word? 

""ELM"" is 3? 

""ELUDE"": E,U,D,E -> but E repeated? Also U,D? 
  ELUDE: E(1),L(2),U(3),D(4),E(5) -> but E at5? We know E cannot be at5? So ""ELUDE"" has E at1 and5? But we know E is not at5? So if we guess ""ELUDE"", then pos5 E will be wrong? 

Avoid? 

""ELOPS""? Not common? 

Another: ""ELOGE""? Not word? 

But wait: we must avoid O? O eliminated? Yes? So we can't use O? 

How about ""ELDER"": E,L,D,E,R -> but R eliminated? 

""EMPTY"": E,M,P,T,Y -> T eliminated? 

""ELVES"": E,L,V,E,S -> E repeated? And S? But E at pos1 and pos4? But we know E not at pos4 (previous)? So put E at pos4? Will be known wrong? 

Alternatively, E at pos3? Words: _ _ E _ _

With L included? And avoiding pos3 for L? But E at pos3? So L elsewhere? 

How about ""PLACE"": P,L,A,C,E -> A and C eliminated? 

""FLIES"": F,L,I,E,S -> F and I eliminated? 

""GLUEY"": G,L,U,E,Y -> L at pos2? E at pos4? But we know E not at pos4? 

Then ""SLED"" not 5? 

""MOVED"": M,O,V,E,D -> O eliminated? 

Therefore, let me think of words with E at pos1? 

""ELVES"" is not word? Actually, ""ELVES"" is valid? E1, L2, V3, E4, S5? But E at4 is bad? Because we know E not at pos4? So S5? 

But we know E must be at1 or3? So putting E at1? In ""ELVES"", E is at1? And E at4? Position4? That's not allowed? We know E not at4? So if the word has E at1 and4, we are putting E at4? Which should be incorrect? 

We could avoid redundant E? We don't know if the word has duplicate E? But to prevent waste, avoid putting E in positions we already know are wrong? 

Ideal: a word with E at position1? And L at another position (2,4,5)? And other letters? 

Possible words: 
  ""ELMSY"" invalid?
  ""ELD"" not 5? 

  ""ELMUD""? Not word? 

Better: ""ELSH"" not? 

With S? ""ELSIN""? E,L,S,I,N -> I and N eliminated? 

Therefore, perhaps E at pos3? 

Try position3: E? 

Possible word: _ _ E _ _

With L: place L at pos1,2,4,5? But avoid pos3? 

And other letters? 

Example: ""PLEDE""? P,L,E,D,E -> but D and E? And E at pos3 and5? pos5 bad? 

""GLEDE""? G,L,E,D,E -> same? 

""SLESE""? Not word? 

""STEEL""? S,T,E,E,L -> T eliminated? 

""SKEEP""? Not common? 

Another: ""QUELL""? Q,U,E,L,L -> E at pos3? Yes? Positions: Q1, U2, E3, L4, L5? 

But L at pos4 and5? And U? 

Also, Q is less common? 

But it has E at pos3? And L at pos4 and5? 

But can we use Q? 

Alternatively, ""GUESS""? G,U,E,S,S -> E at pos3? Positions: G1,U2,E3,S4,S5? But no L? We did not include L? 

We must include L? Yes? Because we need to test L? But we can't? Actually, we have L present? But if we don't include L? Then feedback would show that? But we know L is in the word? So if we guess without L, we get L missing? But we already know L is present? So it would be better to include L? 

We need to cover L? So all guesses must include L? Until we have it located? 

Similarly for E? 

So yes? 

So for E at pos3, word must have L? 

Possible words: 
  ""ALLEY"" -> A eliminated? 
  ""BLEED"" -> B eliminated? 
  ""CLEEK"" -> C eliminated? 
  ""DLEEK"" not word? 
  ""FLEET"" -> F eliminated? 
  ""GLEED""? G,L,E,E,D -> E repeated? But E at pos3? Also D? 
    GLEED is valid? An alternative spelling of GLEE? But usually 4? 
  ""HELIO"" -> H eliminated? 
  ""ILEAC"" -> I eliminated? 

So hard? 

How about ""LUPES""? L,U,P,E,S -> E at pos4? Bad? 

""LUEMS""? Not word? 

Another: ""MELD"" not 5? Meld is 4? 

But ""MELDY"" not word? 

""PELFS"" not? 

""QUELS"" -> Q,U,E,L,S? L at pos4? E at pos3? 

Position: Q1,U2,E3,L4,S5? 

Letters: Q,U,E,L,S? Avoids eliminated? Eliminated? A,B,C,F,H,I,N,O,R,T,W? So Q,U,E,L,S are okay? 

But Q is rare? But we need a word? 

So ""QUELS"" is valid? Meaning of quel? 

But better? S something? 

How about ""SLEEK""? S,L,E,E,K -> E at pos3? And L at pos2? E repeated? 

Positions: S1,L2,E3,E4,K5? But E at pos4? Which is wrong? But we put E at pos4? We know E not at pos4? So that would be bad? 

Similarly, ""SLYPE"" -> S,L,Y,P,E? E? at pos5? Bad? 

Therefore, we can choose ""QUELS"".

But I think E at pos1 might be better? Because more words? 

Let's try E at pos1? 

Possible: ""ELD"" not 5? 

""ELM"" not 5? 

""ELKSY"" not? 

""ELPSY"" not? 

""JELAB"" not? 

""KELTS""? K,E,L,T,S -> T eliminated? 

""LEMEL"" L,E,M,E,L -> but L and E and M? Positions: L1,E2,M3,E4,L5? 
  But note: L is at pos1 and5? And E at pos2? But we know E not at pos2? From below? Guess3 showed E at pos2? Got '-'? Meaning not at pos2? So if we guess with E at pos2? We'll get '-' again? 

But we are placing L at pos1 and5? And E at pos2? 

But E at pos2? We already know it is not there? Because of previous feedback? So the E at pos2 will be marked as '-', which we know? So it doesn't help? 

Similarly, if we put E at pos1? Then that might be good? But at pos2? Bad? 

For a word with E at pos1? And no other E? 

Example: ""EDGES""? E at1 and E at4? Bad? 

""ELANS"" -> A and N eliminated? 

""EMBUS""? E1,M2,B3,U4,S5? But B eliminated? 

""EMMET""? E at1 and E at4? Bad? 

""ENOKI"" -> N and O? N eliminated? 

Therefore, perhaps we have to use less common letters? 

""EPHOD"" -> E1,P2,H3,O4,D5? But H and O eliminated? 

""EPACT"" -> A and T? Eliminated? 

""ERUVS"" -> R eliminated? 

""ESKAR"" -> A eliminated? 

""EXULS"" not? 

""EYASS"" not? 

Then ""ELVEN"": E1,L2,V3,E4,N5? N eliminated? and E at4? Bad? 

But N eliminated? So no? 

""ELVIS"": E1,L2,V3,I4,S5? But I eliminated? 

""EKING"": E1,K2,I3,N4,G5? I and N eliminated? 

""EMYDES"" not 5? 

Therefore, perhaps E at pos3 is unavoidable? We might need to guess a word with E at pos3? And L at pos1,2,4 or5? 

Ideal: ""SMELL"": S1, M2, E3, L4, L5 -> letters S,M,E,L? And L repeated? But M and S are common? 

But ""SMELL""? Valid? And avoids eliminated letters? 

Letters: S,M,E,L,L? Eliminated letters: none of these are eliminated? 
  Eliminated: A,B,C,F,H,I,N,O,R,T,W? So S,M,E,L are okay? 

Also, E at pos3? Which we haven't tested? 

L positions: pos4 and5? And L cannot be at pos3? Which is fine. 

We don't know if L can be at 4 or5? 

But this guess? 

If we guess ""SMELL"", then:
  If E at pos3: then E gets ✓? 
  And L is present? But L is at pos4 and5? If the word has one L, then one L might be marked correctly? 

But since we know L is present? The feedback will show it. 

Alternatively, ""MELKS""? M1,E2,L3,K4,S5 -> L is at pos3? But we know L cannot be at pos3! From guess3: L got '-' meaning it is in the word but not at pos3? So if we put L at pos3? We will get '-' at least? For L at pos3? 

So in ""MELKS"", E at pos2? Which we already know not? We also know E not at pos2? 

Therefore, avoid: 

"" Also, L at pos3? Not allowed.

So how about ""SLEDS""? S,L,E,D,S -> L at pos2? E at pos3? D and S? But D? 
  Positions: S1,L2,E3,D4,S5? 
  E at pos3? L at pos2? Avoiding L at pos3? 

But we have S? And D? 

But in ""SLEDS"", it ends with S5? 

Valid word? ""SLEDS"" is plural of sled? 

Yes? 

And avoid eliminated letters? 

Letters: S,L,E,D,S -> S and E, D? 

Eliminated: none of these? 

But S repeated? 

Alternatively, with only one S? ""SLED"" not 5? 

Or ""SLEDE"" archaic? 

But ""SLEDS"" is acceptable? 

Another option: ""GLED"" not 5? 

So far, ""SLEDS"" and ""SLED"": but ""SLEDS"" is 5? 

Or ""BUMS  not? 

""SET ""not?

""SLED"" plus S? 

But I will choose ""SLEDS"" but it has two S? But that might be okay? We will see the feedback? 

Also, ""SMELL"" might be a better choice? Because it has M? But ""SMELL"" has L at pos4 and5? And E at pos3? 

And letters S and M? Common? 

Whereas ""SLEDS"" has S at1 and5? And D? 

But ""SMELL"" has E at pos3? Which is good? And L at4 and5? 

But feedback: for L, since it is at two positions, and the word might have one or two L? But we know L is present? 

After reconsideration, let's go with ""SMELT"". But ""SMELT"" has T? T eliminated? 

No? 

How about ""SPELL"". S1,P2,E3,L4,L5? P is available? ""SPELL"": S,P,E,L? 

This seems good? 

""SPELL"": 
  S at1, P at2, E at3, L at4, L at5?

E at3? P2? S1? L4,L5? 

And avoids eliminated letters? 

Yes? Letters: S,P,E,L? 

And E at position3? L at4 and5? 

So this works? 

But L cannot be at pos3? What about in ""SPELL"", no L at pos3? 

Also, E at3? 

So guess: SPELL

But in ""SPELL"", L is repeated? But we can still guess it? 

I think this is valid? 

""SPELL"" is a valid English word? 

Yes? 

So let's use ""SPELL"" as the fourth guess.

So our fourth guess: SPELL

Format: <guess>spell</guess> 

But let's recap:
  E at position3? If E is in the word at pos3, we get ✓? If not, we get '-'? Then E must be at pos1? 

  Also, L at pos4 and5? But feedback will show how L matches? 

We might waste a position because of duplicate L? But it's okay? 

Alternatively, is there a word with E at pos3 and L without duplication? 

For example, ""SOLVS""? No? 

""ULZEN"" not word? 

Therefore, ""SPELL"" is acceptable.### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
**Guess 1: CRANE → FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)**  
- ✗ C, R, A, N: Eliminated.  
- ➖ E: Present, but not in position 5.

**Guess 2: THIEF → FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) I(x) E(-) F(x)**  
- ✗ T, H, I, F: Eliminated.  
- ➖ E: Present, but not in position 4.

**Guess 3: BELOW → FEEDBACK: B(x) E(-) L(-) O(x) W(x)**  
- ✗ B, O, W: Eliminated.  
- ➖ E: Present, but not in position 2.  
- ➖ L: Present, but not in position 3.

### Key Deductions:
1. **Eliminated Letters**: A, B, C, F, H, I, N, O, R, T, W.  
   - Remaining valid letters: **D, G, J, K, M, P, Q, S, U, V, X, Y, Z**.

2. **Definitive Presence**:  
   - **E**: Must be in the word. Positions 2, 4, and 5 are invalid (tested). **Only positions 1 or 3 are possible**.  
   - **L**: Must be in the word. Position 3 is invalid (tested). Possible positions: 1, 2, 4, or 5.

3. **Strategy for Guess 4**:  
   - Prioritize placing **E in position 3** to test this untested position.  
     - If E is ✓, position 3 is correct.  
     - If E is ➖, E must be in position 1.  
   - **Position L away from position 3** (confirmed invalid). Placed in position 4/5.  
   - Use **common remaining letters** (S, P, D, U, M) for coverage.  
   - The word **SPELL** is chosen:  
     - E at position 3 (tests untested slot).  
     - L at position 4/5 (tests possible positions with redundancy).  
     - S and P are high-frequency letters.  
     - Avoids all eliminated letters.  

### Selected Guess: **SPELL**  
- **Structure**:  
  - Position 1: **S** (common)  
  - Position 2: **P** (common)  
  - Position 3: **E** (critical test for position)  
  - Position 4: **L** (presence confirmed, tests position)  
  - Position 5: **L** (redundant placement; reveals if L repeats or clarifies position)",Guess 4: spell -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(✓) E(✓) L(✓) L(✓),SUCCESS
