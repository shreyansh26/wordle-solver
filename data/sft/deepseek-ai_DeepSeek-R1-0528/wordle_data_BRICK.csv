We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 I will choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 Let's go with ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E. These are common letters.

We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: ""-"" meaning C is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R: ""✓"" meaning R is in the word and in the correct position (so R is the second letter).
- A: ""x"" meaning A is not in the word.
- N: ""x"" meaning N is not in the word.
- E: ""x"" meaning E is not in the word.

So, we know:
- The second letter is R.
- The letter C is in the word, but not as the first letter (since we got C in first position but it's marked wrong position). Since C is present but not in position 1, it must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- The letters A, N, E are not in the word at all.

Also, we know the secret word is 5 letters and must have R in the second position and C somewhere else.

We can think of possible words:
- The word pattern is: _ R _ _ _
- With C in one of the positions 3,4,5, but not 1 because we already tried C in first and it was wrong.

But note: since A, N, E are out, we avoid those letters.

We also note that we have only 6 tries, so we want to make a guess that can reveal more information.

Since we know R is fixed at position 2 and C is in the word but not at position 1 (and not at 2 because R is there), let's list possible letters:

For the first position: it cannot be A, N, E (from the x's). Also, it cannot be R (since R is second) and not C (because we already ruled C in first as wrong). So let's think of common consonants without A, E.

Possible candidates for first letter: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we must ensure that C is in the word and in positions 3,4, or 5.

Also, the word cannot contain A, N, E at any positions.

So, let's try to find a word that has:
- Second letter R
- Contains the letter C (but not at first position)
- Does not contain A, N, E
- We want to include other common letters that we haven't tested to get more feedback.

For example, we could try a word with these constraints and include other vowels or consonants that are common. Since E and A are out, the vowels must be from I, O, U.

But note: English words without A and E are less common, but possible.

Also, we don't know about the positions after R.

We should try a word that has C in a different position. For example, in position 3, 4, or 5.

Let me think of words matching the pattern _ R _ _ _

Some words that come to mind:
- BRICK? But note A, N, E are out so B is possible. Also, contains I and K? But we have to check if it avoids A,N,E.
- BRICK: B is new, R is fixed second, I, C, K. This word has no A, no N, no E. It might be a candidate.

But wait, we just have feedback for CRANE: first letter was C and we got - meaning C is present but not in first. In BRICK, C is at position 4? Let me spell: B-R-I-C-K. So R at second, C at fourth? Then positions: 1:B, 2:R, 3:I, 4:C, 5:K.

But we don't know if I, C, K are valid. Let's think of another: DRUMS? But D is a candidate? D-R-U-M-S? But no E,A,N? But does it have C? No, so we cannot use DRUMS because we need to have C in the word? Actually, wait: the feedback said C is in the word, so we must include C in the guess? Actually, no: we don't have to, but we know C is in the secret word, so if we don't include C, we might get an x and then we know? But the rules: we must include C because it's present? Or no: we can guess words without C, but that might not be efficient because we already know C is in the word.

In Wordle, we can guess any word, even if it doesn't include known letters? But strategically, we might want to include known letters to confirm their positions.

Actually, we know C is present and must be in positions 3,4, or 5. So if we guess a word that doesn't have C, we risk wasting a guess? Because we know the word has C.

So I think we should include C in the guess to pin down its position.

Therefore, our next guess should include:
- R at the second position.
- C in one of the positions 3,4, or 5 (but not first, and we know first is not C).
- Avoid letters A, N, E.

Also, we can try to introduce new common letters to get more feedback.

Let me recall: CRANE had C(-), so C is not at position 1, but present. And R(✓) at position 2.

So positions we know: 
Position 1: unknown (but not A,C,N,E? Actually, we know A,N,E are absent so first letter cannot be A,N,E. Also, C is present but not at position 1, so first letter is one of the other letters? But let's list forbidden letters: A, N, E are absent from the entire word. So no A, no N, no E anywhere.

Meaning: the secret word contains R (at position 2) and C (somewhere not 1 or 2? Actually position 2 is R, so C not at 1 and not at 2? Wait: could C be at position 2? But position 2 is R, so C cannot be at position 2? Because R is there? Actually, no: R is fixed at position 2? Actually, we have R(✓) so R is at position 2. But if C were at position 2? That's impossible since only one letter per position.

So C must be at position 3,4, or 5.

Similarly, the letter at position 2 is R, so nothing else.

For our next guess structure: position 1: some letter (not A,N,E,C), position 2: R, position 3: some letter (could be C?), position 4: some letter (could be C?), position 5: some letter (could be C?).

But we want to include C to test its position.

So let's choose a word with:
Position 1: new letter, say S? (common)
Position 2: R
Position 3: new letter, say T? (common)
Position 4: C (to test if C is at position 4)
Position 5: H? So ""STRCH"" - wait, not a word.

Common words: we can try ""SCRUM""? But SCRUM: S C R U M? But wait, position 2 would be C? Then R at position 3? But we need R at position 2? So ""SCRUM"" has positions: 1:S, 2:C -> but we need position 2 to be R? So that doesn't work.

We need the second letter to be R? So pattern: ?R? 

So words: BR, CR, DR, FR, etc. But we know C cannot be at first? And we avoid A,N,E? And include C somewhere.

List words that start with? and second letter R? So B? BR? For example: BRICK, BRUSH, CRUMB? But CRUMB: C R ... so first letter C? But we already know first letter isn't C? Because in CRANE, we had C in first and it was ""-"" meaning it exists but wrong position? So we must have C not at first? Then words starting with C? For example: ""C?R? ""? But that would put R at third? Because second is the second letter? Example: CAR => C A R. But R is third? So we need pattern: [first: not C] then second: R? 

So first letter can't be C? Because we tried C at first and it was wrong position? But also, A is absent so no word like CAR.

Possibilities: 
- BR? words: BRICK? B R I C K -> has C at position 4? And avoids A,N,E? Yes.
- OR? words: ORBIT? O R B I T -> has no C? But we must include C? So we cannot? Because C is in the word? So if we guess ORBIT, we know C exists? But if we get an x for C? But we already know C is present? Actually we don't need to include known letters? But we can? It's strategic.

But if we don't include C, we might not learn its position? So I think it's better to include C to pin down.

So words: 
- Starting with B: BRICK? B R I C K -> positions: 1:B, 2:R, 3:I, 4:C, 5:K? Avoids A,N,E? Yes.
- Starting with D: DRUCE? Not a word? or DICE? but R at second? DICE: D I C E -> no R? Oh wait, must have R at second? So D? Then R? So DR? DRICE? Not valid. DRIVE? D R I V E -> but E is present? And we know E is absent? Because E was x in CRANE? So no E? 

So DRIVE has E? So invalid.

What about TRICK? T R I C K -> avoids A,N,E? T,R,I,C,K. Seems valid? With C at position 4? And positions: 1:T, 2:R, 3:I, 4:C, 5:K.

But we don't know if T,I,K are good? We can try.

Other words: PRICK? P R I C K -> P,R,I,C,K? Same structure.

But also, C could be in position 3? For example: BR? ""BR"" with C at third: but third letter? Like BRACE? But A and E? Eliminated? So no BRACE.

Or C at fifth: BRING -> but N is absent? So no.

Or BROKE -> E present? No.

So BRICK and TRICK are candidates? But BRICK: B R I C K? Valid word? And TRICK: T R I C K, valid.

Perhaps FR? FRICK? Not common? Maybe FRISK? But S? and K? FR? FRISK: F R I S K? Then C? Missing? We need to include C? So FRISK doesn't have C? So that wouldn't test C? Because we know C must be in? So FRISK without C? Then if we guess FRISK, we would expect an x for C? But we already know C is present? So that wastes the opportunity to test C? We want to pin down C? So we should include it.

Therefore, guessing a word that has C in position 3,4, or 5 but with R at position 2.

Let me list:
- Position 3: we can put C? So ? R C ... then two more letters? Example: TRUCK? T R U C K -> U? And avoids A,N,E? Yes? T,R,U,C,K? Then ""TRUCK"" might be good? Position 3 is U? No: TRUCK: T R U C K -> positions: 1:T, 2:R, 3:U, 4:C, 5:K? So C is at 4.

But also, there could be words with C at position 5: ? R ? ? C? Like BR? something? BRUSC? Not valid? BRO? BROOC? Not valid? So not many? How about TRACT? But T R A C T -> A present? And A is forbidden? So no.

So C at position 3: ?R C? So letters: position 1: ?, 2:R, 3:C? Then position 4 and 5: other letters? Example: FRACT? Not valid without A? PRICE? But P R I C E -> E? Forbidden? So not. TRICE? T R I C E -> E forbidden? So TRICK? But C at 4? Actually TRICK: T R I C K -> C at position 4.

There seems to be a lack of words with C at position 3? Because ?R C? That's like ARC? But then two letters? Actually, words like CR? but first letter cannot be C? So starting with other? Like FORCE? Not? Not R at second? FORCE has O as first? Then R as third? Not? So we need words with pattern: [first][R second][C third]? Example: ""D R C? ?"" Not really? How about TRACE? But E and A? Eliminated? TRACE: T R A C E -> A and E? Eliminated? So no.

Perhaps we must put C at position 4 or 5? And I think TRICK is a good candidate? Or BRICK? Or PRICK? Or CRICK? CRICK: C R ... -> but C R? First letter C? Then second R? Then position: then I C K? So C R I C K? Two C? But that could be? But we have C? And R? But in CR? first letter C? But we cannot? Because we tried CRANE and C in first was wrong position? So C cannot be first? So CRICK? C R? So first letter C? Then R? Then I? So position: C at position 1 and also position 5? But we know C is present? But position 1 C was marked as present but wrong position? That would mean the secret word has C but not at position 1? So CRICK: if the secret word is CRICK? Then guess CRANE? First C: present but wrong position? Actually in CRICK? Position of C? First and fifth? Then when we guess CRANE? CRANE: C is first? Secret has C at first? Then why was it marked ""-"" meaning C is present but not in position 1? That would be a conflict? Actually, in Wordle, if duplicate letters? Then feedback: if secret is CRICK and guess CRANE? Then first C: secret has C at position 1 and other positions? But since CRICK has C at position 1, then C in guess position 1 would be correct? Then ✓? But if secret is TRICK? Then CRANE: C in the guess at first? Secret has T? No? So then C not in secret? But wait, secret TRICK? Then no C? Then first C would be x? But earlier secret BRISK? Which has C? Let me review our first example? Actually, in the example provided: It had BRISK and STORM: S(-) meaning S is in the word? But BRISK has S? Position? S is at position 4? Then STORM has S first? So they gave - meaning S present but not at first. So duplicate letters? But actually, if secret has duplicate letters? Then the feedback: for each guess letter? But in our case, we don't know if duplicate? But in CRANE feedback: C was marked as -? Meaning at least one C is present? But not at position 1? Then it could be present elsewhere? Including multiple times? 

But for CRICK? It has C at first? But then when we guess CRANE? We have C at first? Then it should be ✓? Because it matches? So we couldn't have C at first? Therefore, words starting with C are not possible? Because we already ruled C at first? So we avoid first letter C? And C must be at positions 3,4, or 5? Only one position? Unless duplicate? But we don't know? But possible? So CRICK? Not possible? Because CRICK start with C? But our first guess CRANE had C at first? And it was wrong? So no? So CRICK is not allowed? Because it starts with C? Similarly, we cannot guess words starting with C? Because position 1 C was incorrect.

So back? Then our choices: 
- TRICK: T R I C K? Valid? Avoids A,N,E? Yes.
- BRICK: B R I C K? Valid? Avoids A,N,E? Yes.
- PRICK: P R I C K? Same.
- CL? R? But not pattern? R must be second? So no?

Also, we note that TRICK includes I and K? And we haven't tested these letters? So guessing TRICK or BRICK would tell us about I and K? And also pin down the position of C? Because in TRICK, C is at position 4? If it is present? But we know C is present? We'll see if C at 4 is correct? Or not.

Other words: C at 4? How about WORC? Not WORC? But words like BORC? No? So TRICK seems good.

Also, we haven't tested many other letters? So guessing TRICK uses T, I, K? Which are common letters? We can get feedback on them.

Alternatively, we could omit C? To test other positions? But that seems wasteful? Since we need to place C? So I think including C is better? Let's go with TRICK? Or BRICK? Or PRICK? 

Since TRICK starts with T? T is a common letter? And BRICK with B? Also common? But T is more common? Actually, T is more common? So TRICK? Or STICK? But STICK: S T I C K? Then positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:I, 4:C, 5:K? But we need position 2 to be R? Here it's T? So not? Doesn't match? Because we must have R at second.

So STR? STRICK? Not common? We must stick to ?R pattern? So TRICK seems good? Let me confirm: T R I C K? Valid word? Yes? Meaning a deceitful act? 

Similarly, BRICK? Or PRICK? Also valid? We can choose any?

I think it doesn't matter much? Let's go with TRICK? To test T and K.

Also, note that C is at 4? If the secret word has C at 4? Then we get ✓ for C? Else - or x? But we know it's present? So if at 4 is wrong? Then it should be - meaning present but wrong position? Or if not at 4? But it must be in 3 or 5? Since 1 and 2 are taken? But we have position 3? Is it possible?

In TRICK? Position 3 is I? Position 4 is C? Position 5 is K? So if C is actually at position 3? Then for TRICK? Position 4 C? Would be reported? As ""-"" for C? Then we know C is not at 4? But at 3 or 5? Similarly, if C is at 5? Then position 4 C? Would be not present? But we'd see it as x? But since we know C is present? It might be ""-"" somewhere else? Or x? Actually, if we have C at position 4 in guess? But secret has C at position 5? Then the first C at 4? Secret has C at 5? Then guess letter C at 4: not in the word at position 4? But the word has C at position 5? So it should be marked as ""-"" (wrong position) because it is in the word but not position 4? Unless there is another C? That's how Wordle handles?

But in our case, we don't know? But standard Wordle rules: each guessed letter is checked against the secret word? If it matches position? ✓? Else if there is the same letter elsewhere? -? Otherwise? x? And if duplicate? It only matches each occurrence once? So it might be a bit tricky? But we'll see.

So I think TRICK is a reasonable guess.

Therefore, next guess: TRICK

In code: so response should be <guess>trick</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is in the word but not in position 1 (marked as ""-"").
- R is correct and in position 2 (marked as ""✓"").
- A, N, and E are not in the word (marked as ""x"").

Key deductions:
1. The secret word has R as the second letter.
2. C is present in the word, but must be in position 3, 4, or 5 (since it is not in 1 or 2).
3. The letters A, N, and E are completely absent.
4. The first letter is unknown but cannot be C (due to feedback), A, N, or E.

For the next guess:
- The word must start with a letter that isn't excluded, include R in position 2, contain C in positions 3-5, and avoid A, N, E.
- ""TRICK"" (T R I C K) fits these requirements:
  - T is a common consonant not yet tested.
  - Positions: T (new letter), R (verified), I (new vowel), C (known but misplaced in previous guess), K (new consonant).
- This guess helps test C's position and potentially reveal more letters.

<guess>trick</guess>",trick,"We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: ""-"" meaning C is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R: ""✓"" meaning R is in the word and in the correct position (so R is the second letter).
- A: ""x"" meaning A is not in the word.
- N: ""x"" meaning N is not in the word.
- E: ""x"" meaning E is not in the word.

So, we know:
- The second letter is R.
- The letter C is in the word, but not as the first letter (since we got C in first position but it's marked wrong position). Since C is present but not in position 1, it must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- The letters A, N, E are not in the word at all.

Also, we know the secret word is 5 letters and must have R in the second position and C somewhere else.

We can think of possible words:
- The word pattern is: _ R _ _ _
- With C in one of the positions 3,4,5, but not 1 because we already tried C in first and it was wrong.

But note: since A, N, E are out, we avoid those letters.

We also note that we have only 6 tries, so we want to make a guess that can reveal more information.

Since we know R is fixed at position 2 and C is in the word but not at position 1 (and not at 2 because R is there), let's list possible letters:

For the first position: it cannot be A, N, E (from the x's). Also, it cannot be R (since R is second) and not C (because we already ruled C in first as wrong). So let's think of common consonants without A, E.

Possible candidates for first letter: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we must ensure that C is in the word and in positions 3,4, or 5.

Also, the word cannot contain A, N, E at any positions.

So, let's try to find a word that has:
- Second letter R
- Contains the letter C (but not at first position)
- Does not contain A, N, E
- We want to include other common letters that we haven't tested to get more feedback.

For example, we could try a word with these constraints and include other vowels or consonants that are common. Since E and A are out, the vowels must be from I, O, U.

But note: English words without A and E are less common, but possible.

Also, we don't know about the positions after R.

We should try a word that has C in a different position. For example, in position 3, 4, or 5.

Let me think of words matching the pattern _ R _ _ _

Some words that come to mind:
- BRICK? But note A, N, E are out so B is possible. Also, contains I and K? But we have to check if it avoids A,N,E.
- BRICK: B is new, R is fixed second, I, C, K. This word has no A, no N, no E. It might be a candidate.

But wait, we just have feedback for CRANE: first letter was C and we got - meaning C is present but not in first. In BRICK, C is at position 4? Let me spell: B-R-I-C-K. So R at second, C at fourth? Then positions: 1:B, 2:R, 3:I, 4:C, 5:K.

But we don't know if I, C, K are valid. Let's think of another: DRUMS? But D is a candidate? D-R-U-M-S? But no E,A,N? But does it have C? No, so we cannot use DRUMS because we need to have C in the word? Actually, wait: the feedback said C is in the word, so we must include C in the guess? Actually, no: we don't have to, but we know C is in the secret word, so if we don't include C, we might get an x and then we know? But the rules: we must include C because it's present? Or no: we can guess words without C, but that might not be efficient because we already know C is in the word.

In Wordle, we can guess any word, even if it doesn't include known letters? But strategically, we might want to include known letters to confirm their positions.

Actually, we know C is present and must be in positions 3,4, or 5. So if we guess a word that doesn't have C, we risk wasting a guess? Because we know the word has C.

So I think we should include C in the guess to pin down its position.

Therefore, our next guess should include:
- R at the second position.
- C in one of the positions 3,4, or 5 (but not first, and we know first is not C).
- Avoid letters A, N, E.

Also, we can try to introduce new common letters to get more feedback.

Let me recall: CRANE had C(-), so C is not at position 1, but present. And R(✓) at position 2.

So positions we know: 
Position 1: unknown (but not A,C,N,E? Actually, we know A,N,E are absent so first letter cannot be A,N,E. Also, C is present but not at position 1, so first letter is one of the other letters? But let's list forbidden letters: A, N, E are absent from the entire word. So no A, no N, no E anywhere.

Meaning: the secret word contains R (at position 2) and C (somewhere not 1 or 2? Actually position 2 is R, so C not at 1 and not at 2? Wait: could C be at position 2? But position 2 is R, so C cannot be at position 2? Because R is there? Actually, no: R is fixed at position 2? Actually, we have R(✓) so R is at position 2. But if C were at position 2? That's impossible since only one letter per position.

So C must be at position 3,4, or 5.

Similarly, the letter at position 2 is R, so nothing else.

For our next guess structure: position 1: some letter (not A,N,E,C), position 2: R, position 3: some letter (could be C?), position 4: some letter (could be C?), position 5: some letter (could be C?).

But we want to include C to test its position.

So let's choose a word with:
Position 1: new letter, say S? (common)
Position 2: R
Position 3: new letter, say T? (common)
Position 4: C (to test if C is at position 4)
Position 5: H? So ""STRCH"" - wait, not a word.

Common words: we can try ""SCRUM""? But SCRUM: S C R U M? But wait, position 2 would be C? Then R at position 3? But we need R at position 2? So ""SCRUM"" has positions: 1:S, 2:C -> but we need position 2 to be R? So that doesn't work.

We need the second letter to be R? So pattern: ?R? 

So words: BR, CR, DR, FR, etc. But we know C cannot be at first? And we avoid A,N,E? And include C somewhere.

List words that start with? and second letter R? So B? BR? For example: BRICK, BRUSH, CRUMB? But CRUMB: C R ... so first letter C? But we already know first letter isn't C? Because in CRANE, we had C in first and it was ""-"" meaning it exists but wrong position? So we must have C not at first? Then words starting with C? For example: ""C?R? ""? But that would put R at third? Because second is the second letter? Example: CAR => C A R. But R is third? So we need pattern: [first: not C] then second: R? 

So first letter can't be C? Because we tried C at first and it was wrong position? But also, A is absent so no word like CAR.

Possibilities: 
- BR? words: BRICK? B R I C K -> has C at position 4? And avoids A,N,E? Yes.
- OR? words: ORBIT? O R B I T -> has no C? But we must include C? So we cannot? Because C is in the word? So if we guess ORBIT, we know C exists? But if we get an x for C? But we already know C is present? Actually we don't need to include known letters? But we can? It's strategic.

But if we don't include C, we might not learn its position? So I think it's better to include C to pin down.

So words: 
- Starting with B: BRICK? B R I C K -> positions: 1:B, 2:R, 3:I, 4:C, 5:K? Avoids A,N,E? Yes.
- Starting with D: DRUCE? Not a word? or DICE? but R at second? DICE: D I C E -> no R? Oh wait, must have R at second? So D? Then R? So DR? DRICE? Not valid. DRIVE? D R I V E -> but E is present? And we know E is absent? Because E was x in CRANE? So no E? 

So DRIVE has E? So invalid.

What about TRICK? T R I C K -> avoids A,N,E? T,R,I,C,K. Seems valid? With C at position 4? And positions: 1:T, 2:R, 3:I, 4:C, 5:K.

But we don't know if T,I,K are good? We can try.

Other words: PRICK? P R I C K -> P,R,I,C,K? Same structure.

But also, C could be in position 3? For example: BR? ""BR"" with C at third: but third letter? Like BRACE? But A and E? Eliminated? So no BRACE.

Or C at fifth: BRING -> but N is absent? So no.

Or BROKE -> E present? No.

So BRICK and TRICK are candidates? But BRICK: B R I C K? Valid word? And TRICK: T R I C K, valid.

Perhaps FR? FRICK? Not common? Maybe FRISK? But S? and K? FR? FRISK: F R I S K? Then C? Missing? We need to include C? So FRISK doesn't have C? So that wouldn't test C? Because we know C must be in? So FRISK without C? Then if we guess FRISK, we would expect an x for C? But we already know C is present? So that wastes the opportunity to test C? We want to pin down C? So we should include it.

Therefore, guessing a word that has C in position 3,4, or 5 but with R at position 2.

Let me list:
- Position 3: we can put C? So ? R C ... then two more letters? Example: TRUCK? T R U C K -> U? And avoids A,N,E? Yes? T,R,U,C,K? Then ""TRUCK"" might be good? Position 3 is U? No: TRUCK: T R U C K -> positions: 1:T, 2:R, 3:U, 4:C, 5:K? So C is at 4.

But also, there could be words with C at position 5: ? R ? ? C? Like BR? something? BRUSC? Not valid? BRO? BROOC? Not valid? So not many? How about TRACT? But T R A C T -> A present? And A is forbidden? So no.

So C at position 3: ?R C? So letters: position 1: ?, 2:R, 3:C? Then position 4 and 5: other letters? Example: FRACT? Not valid without A? PRICE? But P R I C E -> E? Forbidden? So not. TRICE? T R I C E -> E forbidden? So TRICK? But C at 4? Actually TRICK: T R I C K -> C at position 4.

There seems to be a lack of words with C at position 3? Because ?R C? That's like ARC? But then two letters? Actually, words like CR? but first letter cannot be C? So starting with other? Like FORCE? Not? Not R at second? FORCE has O as first? Then R as third? Not? So we need words with pattern: [first][R second][C third]? Example: ""D R C? ?"" Not really? How about TRACE? But E and A? Eliminated? TRACE: T R A C E -> A and E? Eliminated? So no.

Perhaps we must put C at position 4 or 5? And I think TRICK is a good candidate? Or BRICK? Or PRICK? Or CRICK? CRICK: C R ... -> but C R? First letter C? Then second R? Then position: then I C K? So C R I C K? Two C? But that could be? But we have C? And R? But in CR? first letter C? But we cannot? Because we tried CRANE and C in first was wrong position? So C cannot be first? So CRICK? C R? So first letter C? Then R? Then I? So position: C at position 1 and also position 5? But we know C is present? But position 1 C was marked as present but wrong position? That would mean the secret word has C but not at position 1? So CRICK: if the secret word is CRICK? Then guess CRANE? First C: present but wrong position? Actually in CRICK? Position of C? First and fifth? Then when we guess CRANE? CRANE: C is first? Secret has C at first? Then why was it marked ""-"" meaning C is present but not in position 1? That would be a conflict? Actually, in Wordle, if duplicate letters? Then feedback: if secret is CRICK and guess CRANE? Then first C: secret has C at position 1 and other positions? But since CRICK has C at position 1, then C in guess position 1 would be correct? Then ✓? But if secret is TRICK? Then CRANE: C in the guess at first? Secret has T? No? So then C not in secret? But wait, secret TRICK? Then no C? Then first C would be x? But earlier secret BRISK? Which has C? Let me review our first example? Actually, in the example provided: It had BRISK and STORM: S(-) meaning S is in the word? But BRISK has S? Position? S is at position 4? Then STORM has S first? So they gave - meaning S present but not at first. So duplicate letters? But actually, if secret has duplicate letters? Then the feedback: for each guess letter? But in our case, we don't know if duplicate? But in CRANE feedback: C was marked as -? Meaning at least one C is present? But not at position 1? Then it could be present elsewhere? Including multiple times? 

But for CRICK? It has C at first? But then when we guess CRANE? We have C at first? Then it should be ✓? Because it matches? So we couldn't have C at first? Therefore, words starting with C are not possible? Because we already ruled C at first? So we avoid first letter C? And C must be at positions 3,4, or 5? Only one position? Unless duplicate? But we don't know? But possible? So CRICK? Not possible? Because CRICK start with C? But our first guess CRANE had C at first? And it was wrong? So no? So CRICK is not allowed? Because it starts with C? Similarly, we cannot guess words starting with C? Because position 1 C was incorrect.

So back? Then our choices: 
- TRICK: T R I C K? Valid? Avoids A,N,E? Yes.
- BRICK: B R I C K? Valid? Avoids A,N,E? Yes.
- PRICK: P R I C K? Same.
- CL? R? But not pattern? R must be second? So no?

Also, we note that TRICK includes I and K? And we haven't tested these letters? So guessing TRICK or BRICK would tell us about I and K? And also pin down the position of C? Because in TRICK, C is at position 4? If it is present? But we know C is present? We'll see if C at 4 is correct? Or not.

Other words: C at 4? How about WORC? Not WORC? But words like BORC? No? So TRICK seems good.

Also, we haven't tested many other letters? So guessing TRICK uses T, I, K? Which are common letters? We can get feedback on them.

Alternatively, we could omit C? To test other positions? But that seems wasteful? Since we need to place C? So I think including C is better? Let's go with TRICK? Or BRICK? Or PRICK? 

Since TRICK starts with T? T is a common letter? And BRICK with B? Also common? But T is more common? Actually, T is more common? So TRICK? Or STICK? But STICK: S T I C K? Then positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:I, 4:C, 5:K? But we need position 2 to be R? Here it's T? So not? Doesn't match? Because we must have R at second.

So STR? STRICK? Not common? We must stick to ?R pattern? So TRICK seems good? Let me confirm: T R I C K? Valid word? Yes? Meaning a deceitful act? 

Similarly, BRICK? Or PRICK? Also valid? We can choose any?

I think it doesn't matter much? Let's go with TRICK? To test T and K.

Also, note that C is at 4? If the secret word has C at 4? Then we get ✓ for C? Else - or x? But we know it's present? So if at 4 is wrong? Then it should be - meaning present but wrong position? Or if not at 4? But it must be in 3 or 5? Since 1 and 2 are taken? But we have position 3? Is it possible?

In TRICK? Position 3 is I? Position 4 is C? Position 5 is K? So if C is actually at position 3? Then for TRICK? Position 4 C? Would be reported? As ""-"" for C? Then we know C is not at 4? But at 3 or 5? Similarly, if C is at 5? Then position 4 C? Would be not present? But we'd see it as x? But since we know C is present? It might be ""-"" somewhere else? Or x? Actually, if we have C at position 4 in guess? But secret has C at position 5? Then the first C at 4? Secret has C at 5? Then guess letter C at 4: not in the word at position 4? But the word has C at position 5? So it should be marked as ""-"" (wrong position) because it is in the word but not position 4? Unless there is another C? That's how Wordle handles?

But in our case, we don't know? But standard Wordle rules: each guessed letter is checked against the secret word? If it matches position? ✓? Else if there is the same letter elsewhere? -? Otherwise? x? And if duplicate? It only matches each occurrence once? So it might be a bit tricky? But we'll see.

So I think TRICK is a reasonable guess.

Therefore, next guess: TRICK

In code: so response should be <guess>trick</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is in the word but not in position 1 (marked as ""-"").
- R is correct and in position 2 (marked as ""✓"").
- A, N, and E are not in the word (marked as ""x"").

Key deductions:
1. The secret word has R as the second letter.
2. C is present in the word, but must be in position 3, 4, or 5 (since it is not in 1 or 2).
3. The letters A, N, and E are completely absent.
4. The first letter is unknown but cannot be C (due to feedback), A, N, or E.

For the next guess:
- The word must start with a letter that isn't excluded, include R in position 2, contain C in positions 3-5, and avoid A, N, E.
- ""TRICK"" (T R I C K) fits these requirements:
  - T is a common consonant not yet tested.
  - Positions: T (new letter), R (verified), I (new vowel), C (known but misplaced in previous guess), K (new consonant).
- This guess helps test C's position and potentially reveal more letters.",Guess 2: trick -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) I(✓) C(✓) K(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,BRICK,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 I will choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 Let's go with ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E. These are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: ""-"" meaning C is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R: ""✓"" meaning R is in the word and in the correct position (so R is the second letter).
- A: ""x"" meaning A is not in the word.
- N: ""x"" meaning N is not in the word.
- E: ""x"" meaning E is not in the word.

So, we know:
- The second letter is R.
- The letter C is in the word, but not as the first letter (since we got C in first position but it's marked wrong position). Since C is present but not in position 1, it must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- The letters A, N, E are not in the word at all.

Also, we know the secret word is 5 letters and must have R in the second position and C somewhere else.

We can think of possible words:
- The word pattern is: _ R _ _ _
- With C in one of the positions 3,4,5, but not 1 because we already tried C in first and it was wrong.

But note: since A, N, E are out, we avoid those letters.

We also note that we have only 6 tries, so we want to make a guess that can reveal more information.

Since we know R is fixed at position 2 and C is in the word but not at position 1 (and not at 2 because R is there), let's list possible letters:

For the first position: it cannot be A, N, E (from the x's). Also, it cannot be R (since R is second) and not C (because we already ruled C in first as wrong). So let's think of common consonants without A, E.

Possible candidates for first letter: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we must ensure that C is in the word and in positions 3,4, or 5.

Also, the word cannot contain A, N, E at any positions.

So, let's try to find a word that has:
- Second letter R
- Contains the letter C (but not at first position)
- Does not contain A, N, E
- We want to include other common letters that we haven't tested to get more feedback.

For example, we could try a word with these constraints and include other vowels or consonants that are common. Since E and A are out, the vowels must be from I, O, U.

But note: English words without A and E are less common, but possible.

Also, we don't know about the positions after R.

We should try a word that has C in a different position. For example, in position 3, 4, or 5.

Let me think of words matching the pattern _ R _ _ _

Some words that come to mind:
- BRICK? But note A, N, E are out so B is possible. Also, contains I and K? But we have to check if it avoids A,N,E.
- BRICK: B is new, R is fixed second, I, C, K. This word has no A, no N, no E. It might be a candidate.

But wait, we just have feedback for CRANE: first letter was C and we got - meaning C is present but not in first. In BRICK, C is at position 4? Let me spell: B-R-I-C-K. So R at second, C at fourth? Then positions: 1:B, 2:R, 3:I, 4:C, 5:K.

But we don't know if I, C, K are valid. Let's think of another: DRUMS? But D is a candidate? D-R-U-M-S? But no E,A,N? But does it have C? No, so we cannot use DRUMS because we need to have C in the word? Actually, wait: the feedback said C is in the word, so we must include C in the guess? Actually, no: we don't have to, but we know C is in the secret word, so if we don't include C, we might get an x and then we know? But the rules: we must include C because it's present? Or no: we can guess words without C, but that might not be efficient because we already know C is in the word.

In Wordle, we can guess any word, even if it doesn't include known letters? But strategically, we might want to include known letters to confirm their positions.

Actually, we know C is present and must be in positions 3,4, or 5. So if we guess a word that doesn't have C, we risk wasting a guess? Because we know the word has C.

So I think we should include C in the guess to pin down its position.

Therefore, our next guess should include:
- R at the second position.
- C in one of the positions 3,4, or 5 (but not first, and we know first is not C).
- Avoid letters A, N, E.

Also, we can try to introduce new common letters to get more feedback.

Let me recall: CRANE had C(-), so C is not at position 1, but present. And R(✓) at position 2.

So positions we know: 
Position 1: unknown (but not A,C,N,E? Actually, we know A,N,E are absent so first letter cannot be A,N,E. Also, C is present but not at position 1, so first letter is one of the other letters? But let's list forbidden letters: A, N, E are absent from the entire word. So no A, no N, no E anywhere.

Meaning: the secret word contains R (at position 2) and C (somewhere not 1 or 2? Actually position 2 is R, so C not at 1 and not at 2? Wait: could C be at position 2? But position 2 is R, so C cannot be at position 2? Because R is there? Actually, no: R is fixed at position 2? Actually, we have R(✓) so R is at position 2. But if C were at position 2? That's impossible since only one letter per position.

So C must be at position 3,4, or 5.

Similarly, the letter at position 2 is R, so nothing else.

For our next guess structure: position 1: some letter (not A,N,E,C), position 2: R, position 3: some letter (could be C?), position 4: some letter (could be C?), position 5: some letter (could be C?).

But we want to include C to test its position.

So let's choose a word with:
Position 1: new letter, say S? (common)
Position 2: R
Position 3: new letter, say T? (common)
Position 4: C (to test if C is at position 4)
Position 5: H? So ""STRCH"" - wait, not a word.

Common words: we can try ""SCRUM""? But SCRUM: S C R U M? But wait, position 2 would be C? Then R at position 3? But we need R at position 2? So ""SCRUM"" has positions: 1:S, 2:C -> but we need position 2 to be R? So that doesn't work.

We need the second letter to be R? So pattern: ?R? 

So words: BR, CR, DR, FR, etc. But we know C cannot be at first? And we avoid A,N,E? And include C somewhere.

List words that start with? and second letter R? So B? BR? For example: BRICK, BRUSH, CRUMB? But CRUMB: C R ... so first letter C? But we already know first letter isn't C? Because in CRANE, we had C in first and it was ""-"" meaning it exists but wrong position? So we must have C not at first? Then words starting with C? For example: ""C?R? ""? But that would put R at third? Because second is the second letter? Example: CAR => C A R. But R is third? So we need pattern: [first: not C] then second: R? 

So first letter can't be C? Because we tried C at first and it was wrong position? But also, A is absent so no word like CAR.

Possibilities: 
- BR? words: BRICK? B R I C K -> has C at position 4? And avoids A,N,E? Yes.
- OR? words: ORBIT? O R B I T -> has no C? But we must include C? So we cannot? Because C is in the word? So if we guess ORBIT, we know C exists? But if we get an x for C? But we already know C is present? Actually we don't need to include known letters? But we can? It's strategic.

But if we don't include C, we might not learn its position? So I think it's better to include C to pin down.

So words: 
- Starting with B: BRICK? B R I C K -> positions: 1:B, 2:R, 3:I, 4:C, 5:K? Avoids A,N,E? Yes.
- Starting with D: DRUCE? Not a word? or DICE? but R at second? DICE: D I C E -> no R? Oh wait, must have R at second? So D? Then R? So DR? DRICE? Not valid. DRIVE? D R I V E -> but E is present? And we know E is absent? Because E was x in CRANE? So no E? 

So DRIVE has E? So invalid.

What about TRICK? T R I C K -> avoids A,N,E? T,R,I,C,K. Seems valid? With C at position 4? And positions: 1:T, 2:R, 3:I, 4:C, 5:K.

But we don't know if T,I,K are good? We can try.

Other words: PRICK? P R I C K -> P,R,I,C,K? Same structure.

But also, C could be in position 3? For example: BR? ""BR"" with C at third: but third letter? Like BRACE? But A and E? Eliminated? So no BRACE.

Or C at fifth: BRING -> but N is absent? So no.

Or BROKE -> E present? No.

So BRICK and TRICK are candidates? But BRICK: B R I C K? Valid word? And TRICK: T R I C K, valid.

Perhaps FR? FRICK? Not common? Maybe FRISK? But S? and K? FR? FRISK: F R I S K? Then C? Missing? We need to include C? So FRISK doesn't have C? So that wouldn't test C? Because we know C must be in? So FRISK without C? Then if we guess FRISK, we would expect an x for C? But we already know C is present? So that wastes the opportunity to test C? We want to pin down C? So we should include it.

Therefore, guessing a word that has C in position 3,4, or 5 but with R at position 2.

Let me list:
- Position 3: we can put C? So ? R C ... then two more letters? Example: TRUCK? T R U C K -> U? And avoids A,N,E? Yes? T,R,U,C,K? Then ""TRUCK"" might be good? Position 3 is U? No: TRUCK: T R U C K -> positions: 1:T, 2:R, 3:U, 4:C, 5:K? So C is at 4.

But also, there could be words with C at position 5: ? R ? ? C? Like BR? something? BRUSC? Not valid? BRO? BROOC? Not valid? So not many? How about TRACT? But T R A C T -> A present? And A is forbidden? So no.

So C at position 3: ?R C? So letters: position 1: ?, 2:R, 3:C? Then position 4 and 5: other letters? Example: FRACT? Not valid without A? PRICE? But P R I C E -> E? Forbidden? So not. TRICE? T R I C E -> E forbidden? So TRICK? But C at 4? Actually TRICK: T R I C K -> C at position 4.

There seems to be a lack of words with C at position 3? Because ?R C? That's like ARC? But then two letters? Actually, words like CR? but first letter cannot be C? So starting with other? Like FORCE? Not? Not R at second? FORCE has O as first? Then R as third? Not? So we need words with pattern: [first][R second][C third]? Example: ""D R C? ?"" Not really? How about TRACE? But E and A? Eliminated? TRACE: T R A C E -> A and E? Eliminated? So no.

Perhaps we must put C at position 4 or 5? And I think TRICK is a good candidate? Or BRICK? Or PRICK? Or CRICK? CRICK: C R ... -> but C R? First letter C? Then second R? Then position: then I C K? So C R I C K? Two C? But that could be? But we have C? And R? But in CR? first letter C? But we cannot? Because we tried CRANE and C in first was wrong position? So C cannot be first? So CRICK? C R? So first letter C? Then R? Then I? So position: C at position 1 and also position 5? But we know C is present? But position 1 C was marked as present but wrong position? That would mean the secret word has C but not at position 1? So CRICK: if the secret word is CRICK? Then guess CRANE? First C: present but wrong position? Actually in CRICK? Position of C? First and fifth? Then when we guess CRANE? CRANE: C is first? Secret has C at first? Then why was it marked ""-"" meaning C is present but not in position 1? That would be a conflict? Actually, in Wordle, if duplicate letters? Then feedback: if secret is CRICK and guess CRANE? Then first C: secret has C at position 1 and other positions? But since CRICK has C at position 1, then C in guess position 1 would be correct? Then ✓? But if secret is TRICK? Then CRANE: C in the guess at first? Secret has T? No? So then C not in secret? But wait, secret TRICK? Then no C? Then first C would be x? But earlier secret BRISK? Which has C? Let me review our first example? Actually, in the example provided: It had BRISK and STORM: S(-) meaning S is in the word? But BRISK has S? Position? S is at position 4? Then STORM has S first? So they gave - meaning S present but not at first. So duplicate letters? But actually, if secret has duplicate letters? Then the feedback: for each guess letter? But in our case, we don't know if duplicate? But in CRANE feedback: C was marked as -? Meaning at least one C is present? But not at position 1? Then it could be present elsewhere? Including multiple times? 

But for CRICK? It has C at first? But then when we guess CRANE? We have C at first? Then it should be ✓? Because it matches? So we couldn't have C at first? Therefore, words starting with C are not possible? Because we already ruled C at first? So we avoid first letter C? And C must be at positions 3,4, or 5? Only one position? Unless duplicate? But we don't know? But possible? So CRICK? Not possible? Because CRICK start with C? But our first guess CRANE had C at first? And it was wrong? So no? So CRICK is not allowed? Because it starts with C? Similarly, we cannot guess words starting with C? Because position 1 C was incorrect.

So back? Then our choices: 
- TRICK: T R I C K? Valid? Avoids A,N,E? Yes.
- BRICK: B R I C K? Valid? Avoids A,N,E? Yes.
- PRICK: P R I C K? Same.
- CL? R? But not pattern? R must be second? So no?

Also, we note that TRICK includes I and K? And we haven't tested these letters? So guessing TRICK or BRICK would tell us about I and K? And also pin down the position of C? Because in TRICK, C is at position 4? If it is present? But we know C is present? We'll see if C at 4 is correct? Or not.

Other words: C at 4? How about WORC? Not WORC? But words like BORC? No? So TRICK seems good.

Also, we haven't tested many other letters? So guessing TRICK uses T, I, K? Which are common letters? We can get feedback on them.

Alternatively, we could omit C? To test other positions? But that seems wasteful? Since we need to place C? So I think including C is better? Let's go with TRICK? Or BRICK? Or PRICK? 

Since TRICK starts with T? T is a common letter? And BRICK with B? Also common? But T is more common? Actually, T is more common? So TRICK? Or STICK? But STICK: S T I C K? Then positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:I, 4:C, 5:K? But we need position 2 to be R? Here it's T? So not? Doesn't match? Because we must have R at second.

So STR? STRICK? Not common? We must stick to ?R pattern? So TRICK seems good? Let me confirm: T R I C K? Valid word? Yes? Meaning a deceitful act? 

Similarly, BRICK? Or PRICK? Also valid? We can choose any?

I think it doesn't matter much? Let's go with TRICK? To test T and K.

Also, note that C is at 4? If the secret word has C at 4? Then we get ✓ for C? Else - or x? But we know it's present? So if at 4 is wrong? Then it should be - meaning present but wrong position? Or if not at 4? But it must be in 3 or 5? Since 1 and 2 are taken? But we have position 3? Is it possible?

In TRICK? Position 3 is I? Position 4 is C? Position 5 is K? So if C is actually at position 3? Then for TRICK? Position 4 C? Would be reported? As ""-"" for C? Then we know C is not at 4? But at 3 or 5? Similarly, if C is at 5? Then position 4 C? Would be not present? But we'd see it as x? But since we know C is present? It might be ""-"" somewhere else? Or x? Actually, if we have C at position 4 in guess? But secret has C at position 5? Then the first C at 4? Secret has C at 5? Then guess letter C at 4: not in the word at position 4? But the word has C at position 5? So it should be marked as ""-"" (wrong position) because it is in the word but not position 4? Unless there is another C? That's how Wordle handles?

But in our case, we don't know? But standard Wordle rules: each guessed letter is checked against the secret word? If it matches position? ✓? Else if there is the same letter elsewhere? -? Otherwise? x? And if duplicate? It only matches each occurrence once? So it might be a bit tricky? But we'll see.

So I think TRICK is a reasonable guess.

Therefore, next guess: TRICK

In code: so response should be <guess>trick</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is in the word but not in position 1 (marked as ""-"").
- R is correct and in position 2 (marked as ""✓"").
- A, N, and E are not in the word (marked as ""x"").

Key deductions:
1. The secret word has R as the second letter.
2. C is present in the word, but must be in position 3, 4, or 5 (since it is not in 1 or 2).
3. The letters A, N, and E are completely absent.
4. The first letter is unknown but cannot be C (due to feedback), A, N, or E.

For the next guess:
- The word must start with a letter that isn't excluded, include R in position 2, contain C in positions 3-5, and avoid A, N, E.
- ""TRICK"" (T R I C K) fits these requirements:
  - T is a common consonant not yet tested.
  - Positions: T (new letter), R (verified), I (new vowel), C (known but misplaced in previous guess), K (new consonant).
- This guess helps test C's position and potentially reveal more letters.

Since C is present but not in position 1, it must be in position 3, 4, or 5.\n- The letters A, N, E are not in the word at all.\n\nAlso, we know the secret word is 5 letters and must have R in the second position and C somewhere else.\n\nWe can think of possible words:\n- The word pattern is: _ R _ _ _\n- With C in one of the positions 3,4,5, but not 1 because we already tried C in first and it was wrong.\n\nBut note: since A, N, E are out, we avoid those letters.\n\nWe also note that we have only 6 tries, so we want to make a guess that can reveal more information.\n\nSince we know R is fixed at position 2 and C is in the word but not at position 1 (and not at 2 because R is there), let\'s list possible letters:\n\nFor the first position: it cannot be A, N, E (from the x\'s). Also, it cannot be R (since R is second) and not C (because we already ruled C in first as wrong). So let\'s think of common consonants without A, E.\n\nPossible candidates for first letter: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we must ensure that C is in the word and in positions 3,4, or 5.\n\nAlso, the word cannot contain A, N, E at any positions.\n\nSo, let\'s try to find a word that has:\n- Second letter R\n- Contains the letter C (but not at first position)\n- Does not contain A, N, E\n- We want to include other common letters that we haven\'t tested to get more feedback.\n\nFor example, we could try a word with these constraints and include other vowels or consonants that are common. Since E and A are out, the vowels must be from I, O, U.\n\nBut note: English words without A and E are less common, but possible.\n\nAlso, we don\'t know about the positions after R.\n\nWe should try a word that has C in a different position. For example, in position 3, 4, or 5.\n\nLet me think of words matching the pattern _ R _ _ _\n\nSome words that come to mind:\n- BRICK? But note A, N, E are out so B is possible. Also, contains I and K? But we have to check if it avoids A,N,E.\n- BRICK: B is new, R is fixed second, I, C, K. This word has no A, no N, no E. It might be a candidate.\n\nBut wait, we just have feedback for CRANE: first letter was C and we got - meaning C is present but not in first. In BRICK, C is at position 4? Let me spell: B-R-I-C-K. So R at second, C at fourth? Then positions: 1:B, 2:R, 3:I, 4:C, 5:K.\n\nBut we don\'t know if I, C, K are valid. Let\'s think of another: DRUMS? But D is a candidate? D-R-U-M-S? But no E,A,N? But does it have C? No, so we cannot use DRUMS because we need to have C in the word? Actually, wait: the feedback said C is in the word, so we must include C in the guess? Actually, no: we don\'t have to, but we know C is in the secret word, so if we don\'t include C, we might get an x and then we know? But the rules: we must include C because it\'s present? Or no: we can guess words without C, but that might not be efficient because we already know C is in the word.\n\nIn Wordle, we can guess any word, even if it doesn\'t include known letters? But strategically, we might want to include known letters to confirm their positions.\n\nActually, we know C is present and must be in positions 3,4, or 5. So if we guess a word that doesn\'t have C, we risk wasting a guess? Because we know the word has C.\n\nSo I think we should include C in the guess to pin down its position.\n\nTherefore, our next guess should include:\n- R at the second position.\n- C in one of the positions 3,4, or 5 (but not first, and we know first is not C).\n- Avoid letters A, N, E.\n\nAlso, we can try to introduce new common letters to get more feedback.\n\nLet me recall: CRANE had C(-), so C is not at position 1, but present. And R(✓) at position 2.\n\nSo positions we know: \nPosition 1: unknown (but not A,C,N,E? Actually, we know A,N,E are absent so first letter cannot be A,N,E. Also, C is present but not at position 1, so first letter is one of the other letters? But let\'s list forbidden letters: A, N, E are absent from the entire word. So no A, no N, no E anywhere.\n\nMeaning: the secret word contains R (at position 2) and C (somewhere not 1 or 2? Actually position 2 is R, so C not at 1 and not at 2? Wait: could C be at position 2? But position 2 is R, so C cannot be at position 2? Because R is there? Actually, no: R is fixed at position 2? Actually, we have R(✓) so R is at position 2. But if C were at position 2? That\'s impossible since only one letter per position.\n\nSo C must be at position 3,4, or 5.\n\nSimilarly, the letter at position 2 is R, so nothing else.\n\nFor our next guess structure: position 1: some letter (not A,N,E,C), position 2: R, position 3: some letter (could be C?), position 4: some letter (could be C?), position 5: some letter (could be C?).\n\nBut we want to include C to test its position.\n\nSo let\'s choose a word with:\nPosition 1: new letter, say S? (common)\nPosition 2: R\nPosition 3: new letter, say T? (common)\nPosition 4: C (to test if C is at position 4)\nPosition 5: H? So ""STRCH"" - wait, not a word.\n\nCommon words: we can try ""SCRUM""? But SCRUM: S C R U M? But wait, position 2 would be C? Then R at position 3? But we need R at position 2? So ""SCRUM"" has positions: 1:S, 2:C -> but we need position 2 to be R? So that doesn\'t work.\n\nWe need the second letter to be R? So pattern: ?R? \n\nSo words: BR, CR, DR, FR, etc. But we know C cannot be at first? And we avoid A,N,E? And include C somewhere.\n\nList words that start with? and second letter R? So B? BR? For example: BRICK, BRUSH, CRUMB? But CRUMB: C R ... so first letter C? But we already know first letter isn\'t C? Because in CRANE, we had C in first and it was ""-"" meaning it exists but wrong position? So we must have C not at first? Then words starting with C? For example: ""C?R? ""? But that would put R at third? Because second is the second letter? Example: CAR => C A R. But R is third? So we need pattern: [first: not C] then second: R? \n\nSo first letter can\'t be C? Because we tried C at first and it was wrong position? But also, A is absent so no word like CAR.\n\nPossibilities: \n- BR? words: BRICK? B R I C K -> has C at position 4? And avoids A,N,E? Yes.\n- OR? words: ORBIT? O R B I T -> has no C? But we must include C? So we cannot? Because C is in the word? So if we guess ORBIT, we know C exists? But if we get an x for C? But we already know C is present? Actually we don\'t need to include known letters? But we can? It\'s strategic.\n\nBut if we don\'t include C, we might not learn its position? So I think it\'s better to include C to pin down.\n\nSo words: \n- Starting with B: BRICK? B R I C K -> positions: 1:B, 2:R, 3:I, 4:C, 5:K? Avoids A,N,E? Yes.\n- Starting with D: DRUCE? Not a word? or DICE? but R at second? DICE: D I C E -> no R? Oh wait, must have R at second? So D? Then R? So DR? DRICE? Not valid. DRIVE? D R I V E -> but E is present? And we know E is absent? Because E was x in CRANE? So no E? \n\nSo DRIVE has E? So invalid.\n\nWhat about TRICK? T R I C K -> avoids A,N,E? T,R,I,C,K. Seems valid? With C at position 4? And positions: 1:T, 2:R, 3:I, 4:C, 5:K.\n\nBut we don\'t know if T,I,K are good? We can try.\n\nOther words: PRICK? P R I C K -> P,R,I,C,K? Same structure.\n\nBut also, C could be in position 3? For example: BR? ""BR"" with C at third: but third letter? Like BRACE? But A and E? Eliminated? So no BRACE.\n\nOr C at fifth: BRING -> but N is absent? So no.\n\nOr BROKE -> E present? No.\n\nSo BRICK and TRICK are candidates? But BRICK: B R I C K? Valid word? And TRICK: T R I C K, valid.\n\nPerhaps FR? FRICK? Not common? Maybe FRISK? But S? and K? FR? FRISK: F R I S K? Then C? Missing? We need to include C? So FRISK doesn\'t have C? So that wouldn\'t test C? Because we know C must be in? So FRISK without C? Then if we guess FRISK, we would expect an x for C? But we already know C is present? So that wastes the opportunity to test C? We want to pin down C? So we should include it.\n\nTherefore, guessing a word that has C in position 3,4, or 5 but with R at position 2.\n\nLet me list:\n- Position 3: we can put C? So ? R C ... then two more letters? Example: TRUCK? T R U C K -> U? And avoids A,N,E? Yes? T,R,U,C,K? Then ""TRUCK"" might be good? Position 3 is U? No: TRUCK: T R U C K -> positions: 1:T, 2:R, 3:U, 4:C, 5:K? So C is at 4.\n\nBut also, there could be words with C at position 5: ? R ? ? C? Like BR? something? BRUSC? Not valid? BRO? BROOC? Not valid? So not many? How about TRACT? But T R A C T -> A present? And A is forbidden? So no.\n\nSo C at position 3: ?R C? So letters: position 1: ?, 2:R, 3:C? Then position 4 and 5: other letters? Example: FRACT? Not valid without A? PRICE? But P R I C E -> E? Forbidden? So not. TRICE? T R I C E -> E forbidden? So TRICK? But C at 4? Actually TRICK: T R I C K -> C at position 4.\n\nThere seems to be a lack of words with C at position 3? Because ?R C? That\'s like ARC? But then two letters? Actually, words like CR? but first letter cannot be C? So starting with other? Like FORCE? Not? Not R at second? FORCE has O as first? Then R as third? Not? So we need words with pattern: [first][R second][C third]? Example: ""D R C? ?"" Not really? How about TRACE? But E and A? Eliminated? TRACE: T R A C E -> A and E? Eliminated? So no.\n\nPerhaps we must put C at position 4 or 5? And I think TRICK is a good candidate? Or BRICK? Or PRICK? Or CRICK? CRICK: C R ... -> but C R? First letter C? Then second R? Then position: then I C K? So C R I C K? Two C? But that could be? But we have C? And R? But in CR? first letter C? But we cannot? Because we tried CRANE and C in first was wrong position? So C cannot be first? So CRICK? C R? So first letter C? Then R? Then I? So position: C at position 1 and also position 5? But we know C is present? But position 1 C was marked as present but wrong position? That would mean the secret word has C but not at position 1? So CRICK: if the secret word is CRICK? Then guess CRANE? First C: present but wrong position? Actually in CRICK? Position of C? First and fifth? Then when we guess CRANE? CRANE: C is first? Secret has C at first? Then why was it marked ""-"" meaning C is present but not in position 1? That would be a conflict? Actually, in Wordle, if duplicate letters? Then feedback: if secret is CRICK and guess CRANE? Then first C: secret has C at position 1 and other positions? But since CRICK has C at position 1, then C in guess position 1 would be correct? Then ✓? But if secret is TRICK? Then CRANE: C in the guess at first? Secret has T? No? So then C not in secret? But wait, secret TRICK? Then no C? Then first C would be x? But earlier secret BRISK? Which has C? Let me review our first example? Actually, in the example provided: It had BRISK and STORM: S(-) meaning S is in the word? But BRISK has S? Position? S is at position 4? Then STORM has S first? So they gave - meaning S present but not at first. So duplicate letters? But actually, if secret has duplicate letters? Then the feedback: for each guess letter? But in our case, we don\'t know if duplicate? But in CRANE feedback: C was marked as -? Meaning at least one C is present? But not at position 1? Then it could be present elsewhere? Including multiple times? \n\nBut for CRICK? It has C at first? But then when we guess CRANE? We have C at first? Then it should be ✓? Because it matches? So we couldn\'t have C at first? Therefore, words starting with C are not possible? Because we already ruled C at first? So we avoid first letter C? And C must be at positions 3,4, or 5? Only one position? Unless duplicate? But we don\'t know? But possible? So CRICK? Not possible? Because CRICK start with C? But our first guess CRANE had C at first? And it was wrong? So no? So CRICK is not allowed? Because it starts with C? Similarly, we cannot guess words starting with C? Because position 1 C was incorrect.\n\nSo back? Then our choices: \n- TRICK: T R I C K? Valid? Avoids A,N,E? Yes.\n- BRICK: B R I C K? Valid? Avoids A,N,E? Yes.\n- PRICK: P R I C K? Same.\n- CL? R? But not pattern? R must be second? So no?\n\nAlso, we note that TRICK includes I and K? And we haven\'t tested these letters? So guessing TRICK or BRICK would tell us about I and K? And also pin down the position of C? Because in TRICK, C is at position 4? If it is present? But we know C is present? We\'ll see if C at 4 is correct? Or not.\n\nOther words: C at 4? How about WORC? Not WORC? But words like BORC? No?

But we need position 2 to be R? Here it\'s T? So not? Doesn\'t match? Because we must have R at second.\n\nSo STR? STRICK? Not common? We must stick to ?R pattern? So TRICK seems good?

Then it should be - meaning present but wrong position? Or if not at 4? But it must be in 3 or 5? Since 1 and 2 are taken? But we have position 3? Is it possible?\n\nIn TRICK? Position 3 is I? Position 4 is C? Position 5 is K? So if C is actually at position 3? Then for TRICK? Position 4 C? Would be reported? As ""-"" for C? Then we know C is not at 4? But at 3 or 5? Similarly, if C is at 5? Then position 4 C? Would be not present? But we\'d see it as x? But since we know C is present? It might be ""-"" somewhere else? Or x? Actually, if we have C at position 4 in guess? But secret has C at position 5? Then the first C at 4? Secret has C at 5? Then guess letter C at 4: not in the word at position 4? But the word has C at position 5? So it should be marked as ""-"" (wrong position) because it is in the word but not position 4? Unless there is another C? That\'s how Wordle handles?\n\nBut in our case, we don\'t know? But standard Wordle rules: each guessed letter is checked against the secret word? If it matches position? ✓?

- Position 3: I (fixed)
- Position 4: C (fixed)
- Position 5: K (fixed)
- T is not in the word.

Also, from guess 1, we know A, N, E are not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word must be: _ R I C K

We only need to find the first letter.

Constraints for the first letter:
- It cannot be T (from guess 2: T(x))
- It cannot be A, N, E (from guess 1)
- It cannot be R, I, C, K because those are already in the word and in their positions? Actually, it could be one of them if duplicated? But let's see.

However, from guess 2, we have I, C, K all marked as correct in their positions. That means the secret word has I at position 3, C at 4, K at 5. But what about the first letter? It must be a letter that is not T, A, N, E, and also not conflicting with the existing letters? But the existing letters are R, I, C, K. Could the first letter be one of these? For example, could it be R? But R is already at position 2? If the first letter is R, then the word would be R R I C K? But that has two R's? Is that possible?

In the feedback from guess 1: when we guessed ""crane"", C was marked as present but wrong position. If the secret word were ""RRICK"", then in ""crane"", the first letter C is not in the secret? Because secret has R at first? So C would be marked as absent? But it was marked as present? So that's a contradiction? Therefore, the secret word cannot have R at first? Similarly, if we consider I, C, or K at first? But they are already in the word? Let's check.

Specifically, for the first letter:
- If it were I, then the word would be I R I C K. Then in guess 1 ""crane"", the letter C is at position 1. The secret has I at position 1, so C is not at position 1? But does the secret have a C? Yes, at position 4. So in ""crane"", C at position 1 should be marked as present but wrong position? Which it was. But also, the secret has I at position 1 and 3? But in ""crane"", we don't have I? So that might be possible? Similarly for C: if first letter is C, then secret is C R I C K. Then in ""crane"", C at position 1: secret has C at position 1? So it should be correct? But in feedback, it was marked as ""-"" meaning present but wrong position? Not correct? So if C is at position 1, it should be ✓? But it was not, it was ""-"", so C cannot be at position 1. Similarly, for K: if first letter is K, secret is K R I C K. Then in ""crane"", C at position 1: secret has no C at position 1? But has C at position 4? So C at position 1 in guess should be marked as present but wrong position? Which it was. So that could be possible? But we also have to consider the feedback from guess 2.

In guess 2: ""trick"" -> T(x) R(✓) I(✓) C(✓) K(✓). If the secret is ""KRICK"", then ""trick"" has T at first? Secret has K at first? So T is not in the word? Marked x? Correct. R at 2: ✓, I at 3: ✓, C at 4: ✓, K at 5: ✓. But what about the K at first in secret? In ""trick"", we don't have a K at first? We have K at fifth? So the K at fifth is correctly marked? But the secret has two K's? One at first and one at fifth? Then in ""trick"", we only have one K? At fifth? So the K at fifth is matched? But the first K in secret is not covered? So it should not affect? The feedback for ""trick"" would still be T(x) R(✓) I(✓) C(✓) K(✓) because the K at fifth is correct? And the first K in secret is not guessed? So it doesn't cause an extra mark? So it could be.

Similarly, for I: if secret is ""IRICK"", then in ""trick"": T(x) at first? Secret has I? So T not present? Correct. R(✓), I(✓) at position 3? But secret has I at position 1 and 3? In ""trick"", we have I at position 3? So that I is matched? The I at position 1 in secret is not covered? So no issue? But in ""trick"", we don't have a letter at position 1 that is I? So it should be fine? But we need to check the first guess.

First guess ""crane"": if secret is ""IRICK"", then C at position 1: secret has I at 1? Not C? But secret has C at position 4? So C is present? So marked as ""-"" for position 1? Which matches. A, N, E absent? Yes.

But is ""IRICK"" a word? I don't think so? Common words: let's think of valid words ending with ""RICK"".

Common words: BRICK, PRICK, TRICK, but we already guessed TRICK? And T is out? So not TRICK.

Other: FRICK? Not standard? Or CRICK? But C at first? We ruled out? Because in ""crane"", C at first should be correct if secret starts with C? But it was not.

So possible first letters: must be a letter that is not T, A, N, E, and not C (because if C were first, it should have been correct in ""crane"" but was not), and not R? Because if R were first, then in ""crane"", C at first: secret has R at first? So C not present? But it was marked present? Contradiction.

Let me formalize:

- If the secret word has X at position 1, then in guess ""crane"":
  - If X is C, then position 1 should be ✓, but it was ""-"", so X ≠ C.
  - If X is not C, but C is in the word (at position 4, say), then C at position 1 in guess should be marked as ""-"" (present but wrong position), which it was.
  - But if X is R, then secret has R at position 1 and position 2? Then in ""crane"", C at position 1: secret has no C? Because positions: R at 1, R at 2, I at 3, C at 4, K at 5? So no C? But we have C at position 4? So C is present? But in ""crane"", C at position 1: since secret has no C at position 1, but has C at 4, it should be marked as ""-"". But also, if secret has no C at all? But we know it has C? From the feedback? So if secret is ""RRICK"", it has no C? But feedback from ""crane"" said C is present? Contradiction. Therefore, secret cannot be ""RRICK"" because it has no C? ""RRICK"" has no C? R,R,I,C,K? It has C at position 4? Oh, ""RRICK"" would be R,R,I,C,K? So it has C? Then in ""crane"", C at position 1: secret has R at position 1? So C not at 1? But C is at 4? So it should be marked as present? Which it was. But the issue is: in ""crane"", we have C at 1, and secret has C at 4? So C is present? Marked as ""-"" for position 1? Correct. But what about the letter R? In ""crane"", R is at position 2? Secret has R at position 2? So ✓. But secret also has R at position 1? In ""crane"", we don't have R at position 1? So no feedback for that? So it could be? But is ""RRICK"" a valid word? I don't think so? Not a common English word.

Similarly, for K: if secret is ""KRICK"", then in ""crane"": C at position 1: secret has K at 1? Not C? But C at 4? So C present? Marked as ""-"" for position 1? Correct. R at 2: ✓. A,N,E absent? Yes.

But ""KRICK"" is not a word? Common words: BRICK, PRICK, FRICK? Or CRICK? But CRICK starts with C? Which we ruled out.

What about BRICK? B is not excluded? In guess 1, we didn't test B? And in guess 2, we didn't test B? So B is possible? Similarly, P? F? Etc.

So possible words: BRICK, PRICK, or perhaps WRICK? Not common? Or GRICK? Not.

Standard English words: BRICK and PRICK are common.

Also, could be FRICK? But less common? Or DRICK? No.

So likely BRICK or PRICK.

But we need to distinguish? We have only one letter to guess? The first letter.

We know T is out? A,N,E out? C cannot be first? R cannot be first? Because if R first, then secret ""RRICK"" is not a word? Similarly, I first: ""IRICK"" not a word? K first: ""KRICK"" not a word? So only possibilities are B, P, or maybe other? Like S? But SRICK? Not a word? Or W? WRICK? Not common? D? DRICK? No.

So probably BRICK or PRICK.

But we have no information about B or P? So we need to guess one? We have 4 guesses left? But we can guess one of them? Or we can make a guess that includes both? But we only have one position to fill? So we must guess either BRICK or PRICK? Or we can guess a word that has B or P? But we need to fill the first position? And we know positions 2-5 are fixed? So the word must be ?RICK? With ? being B or P? Or other? But other letters? Like F? FRICK? But is it valid? In some contexts? But let's assume standard Wordle dictionary.

To be safe, we can guess BRICK? Since it's common? Or PRICK? But PRICK might be sensitive? But in Wordle, it is accepted? I think.

But we have to choose one? We can guess BRICK? Then if wrong, we know it's PRICK? But we have more guesses? So we can.

But let's see if we can get more information? But we don't have other positions? The word is fixed except first letter? So we must guess the first letter.

Possible first letters: B, P, F, W? But only B and P are common.

Let me list all possible: 
- B: BRICK
- P: PRICK
- F: FRICK (if accepted, meaning a surname or something)
- C: but C is ruled out? CRICK? But C at first? Ruled out? Because in ""crane"", C at first should be correct? But it was not? So no.
- Also, H: HRICK? No.
- S: SRICK? No.
- W: WRICK? Not common? But in some dialects? Not standard.

So probably BRICK or PRICK.

We can guess BRICK? If it's correct, we win? If not, then it must be PRICK? Or FRICK? But FRICK is less likely.

In Wordle, common words are used? So likely BRICK or PRICK.

Since we have no information, we can choose arbitrarily? Or based on frequency? B is more common than P? But in this context, both are possible.

But note: in guess 1, we had C at first? And it was wrong? But we don't know about B or P.

So I think we should guess BRICK? Because it's a common word.

If we guess BRICK and it's wrong, then we know it's PRICK? And we can guess that next.

But we have 4 guesses left? So it's safe.

Therefore, next guess: BRICK

But let's confirm the feedback we would get? If secret is BRICK, then guess BRICK: all ✓? Win.

If secret is PRICK, then guess BRICK: B at first? Secret has P? So B not in word? Marked x? Then R(✓), I(✓), C(✓), K(✓)? So we get B(x) and others correct? Then we know first letter is not B? So it must be P? Then next guess PRICK.

Similarly, if secret is FRICK? Then BRICK: B(x) R(✓) I(✓) C(✓) K(✓)? Same? Then we might need to try P? Then F? But FRICK might not be in the word list? So probably not.

So I think BRICK is a good guess.

Therefore, we guess ""brick"".

In code: <guess>brick</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(-) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)**  
  This indicates:
  - C is in the word but not in position 1.
  - R is in the word and correctly placed at position 2.
  - A, N, and E are not in the word.

- **Guess 2: ""trick"" → T(x) R(✓) I(✓) C(✓) K(✓)**  
  This indicates:
  - T is not in the word.
  - R is confirmed at position 2.
  - I is in the word and correctly placed at position 3.
  - C is in the word and correctly placed at position 4.
  - K is in the word and correctly placed at position 5.

### Deductions:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ R I C K` (positions 2–5 are fixed as R, I, C, K).
- The first letter must be determined, and it cannot be:
  - T (from Guess 2 feedback).
  - A, N, or E (from Guess 1 feedback).
  - C (if C were in position 1, it would have been marked as correct in Guess 1, but it was only present and misplaced).
  - R, I, or K (since they are already correctly placed in positions 2, 3, and 5, and duplicates are unlikely based on common English words; e.g., ""RRICK"" or ""KRICK"" are not valid words).
- Possible first letters are B, P, or F (based on common 5-letter words ending in ""RICK""), but F is less common (e.g., ""FRICK"" is not standard). Thus, the most likely candidates are B or P, giving ""BRICK"" or ""PRICK"".

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Guess ""BRICK"" to test B as the first letter:
  - If correct, the game is won.
  - If incorrect (B marked as absent), the first letter must be P (""PRICK""), and we can guess that next.
- With 4 guesses remaining, this is efficient and leverages common word knowledge.

<guess>brick</guess>",brick,"We have feedback from two guesses:
