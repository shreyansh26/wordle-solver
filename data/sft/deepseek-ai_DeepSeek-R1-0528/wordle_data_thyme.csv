We are starting the game. Since it's the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. 
A good starting word often has common letters and a variety of distinct letters to get more feedback.

Some popular starting words in Wordle are words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRAIN"", ""ROAST"", etc., because they contain common vowels and consonants.

I'll choose a word that has three common vowels and two common consonants to cover a lot of ground.

Let me choose: ""CRANE""

It has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' – a good mix of vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N). 

So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

I need to make the first guess in the Wordle game. Since I have no prior information, I'll choose a word that maximizes the potential information gain. A good starting word typically:
- Uses common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants
- Has no repeating letters
- Covers a diverse set of frequent English letters (e.g., R, S, T, N, L)

One word that fits these criteria and is often recommended in Wordle strategies is ""CRANE"". It contains:

We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"": 
C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)

This means:
- E is in the secret word and is in the correct position (at the end, since E is the 5th letter).
- C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.

So, we know:
- The secret word ends with E (5th letter is E).
- The letters C, R, A, N are absent.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: _ _ _ _ E

We must avoid using C, R, A, N in our next guess.

Now, we need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (to confirm or get more information about the position of E, but we already know it's at the end, so we can use E at the end to test other letters).
- Does not contain C, R, A, N.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Since E is fixed at the end, we can focus on the first four letters.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, B, etc.

We should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

A good candidate might be a word that has multiple common consonants and vowels that we haven't tested.

Let's consider words ending with E and without C, R, A, N.

Some options:
- ""SLATE"": but S, L, T are new, but A is already known to be absent (from feedback: A(x)), so we cannot use A. Similarly, we cannot use C, R, A, N.

So, we must avoid A. Therefore, ""SLATE"" is invalid because it has A.

Another option: ""SPIKE"" - has S, P, I, K, and ends with E. But we don't know if P, I, K are in the word. Also, it avoids the forbidden letters.

But we might want to include more common vowels. We haven't tested O, U, I, etc.

Another common word: ""STOLE"" - ends with E, and has S, T, O, L. All new letters.

But we must check if it's valid: no C, R, A, N. Yes.

Alternatively, ""SPIKE"" is also good.

But note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize information. ""STOLE"" covers S, T, O, L, and E (which we know). Similarly, ""SPIKE"" covers S, P, I, K, E.

Which one is better? Both are good, but ""STOLE"" has two vowels (O and E) and two common consonants (S, T, L). ""SPIKE"" has I (vowel) and P, K (less common than T and L?).

In terms of letter frequency in English, S and T are very common, then L, O. P and K are less common.

So, ""STOLE"" might be better because it uses more common letters.

But we must also consider that we are trying to find the word, and we know the last letter is E. So, we can try to get information about the first four positions.

Another candidate: ""SHINE"" - has S, H, I, N. But N is forbidden (we had N(x) in the first feedback). So, we cannot use N.

Similarly, ""SUITE"" - has S, U, I, T, E. No forbidden letters? Let's check: no C, R, A, N. So, that's valid.

""SUITE"" has S, U, I, T, E. That's four new letters: S, U, I, T.

But we already know E is at the end, so we are testing the first four with S, U, I, T.

Alternatively, ""STOLE"" has S, T, O, L, E.

I think both are good. Let me choose ""STOLE"" because it has O which is a common vowel.

But note: we have not tested I and U, which are also common vowels. However, we can test them in subsequent guesses.

Since we have limited tries, we should try to cover as many common letters as possible.

Another word: ""HOUSE"" - has H, O, U, S, E. But we already know E is at the end, so we are testing H, O, U, S. And it avoids C, R, A, N.

""HOUSE"" is a valid word.

But ""STOLE"" and ""HOUSE"" both have four new letters. ""STOLE"" has S, T, O, L. ""HOUSE"" has H, O, U, S.

S is common to both. T is more common than H and U? T is very common, H and U are less common.

But we need to test vowels: we haven't tested O, U, I. So, ""HOUSE"" tests two vowels (O and U) and one consonant (H) and S.

""STOLE"" tests one vowel (O) and three consonants (S, T, L).

Since we know the word has an E, and we don't know about other vowels, it might be good to test multiple vowels.

But the secret word might have only one vowel (E) and the rest consonants? But that's rare for 5-letter words. Typically, there are at least two vowels.

In our first guess, we had A and E, but A is absent. So, the secret word has E and at least one more vowel.

Therefore, testing two vowels in one guess might be efficient.

So, ""HOUSE"" tests O and U, which are two vowels we haven't tried.

Alternatively, ""SUITE"" tests U and I.

I think ""SUITE"" is a good option because it has U and I (two vowels) and S and T (two very common consonants).

So, let me go with ""SUITE"".

But wait, ""SUITE"" is S-U-I-T-E. The positions: S at 1, U at 2, I at 3, T at 4, E at 5.

We know E is correct at position 5, so we are testing the first four.

Another candidate: ""POISE"" - P, O, I, S, E. But P and O are new, but we avoid forbidden letters. However, we might prefer more common letters.

I think ""SUITE"" is a solid choice.

But let's check the frequency: S, T, I, U are all common.

I'll go with ""SUITE"".

Alternatively, to cover more common consonants, ""SLIME"" - but L, I, M, but we have S and E. But we don't know about M. However, we cannot use ""SLIME"" because it has M? But M is not forbidden. But we have to avoid C, R, A, N. ""SLIME"" has S, L, I, M, E. That's valid.

But ""SLIME"" has I and M, while ""SUITE"" has U, I, T. T is more common than M.

So, I think ""SUITE"" is better.

But note: we have E at the end, so we don't need to test E again? Actually, we can use E at the end to confirm, but we already know it's there, so it's fine.

I'll choose ""SUITE"".

But let me see if there's a word that uses more of the most common letters. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... but we know A and N are out, so T, O, I, S are good.

A word with T, O, I, S and E? But we have only five letters. ""TOISE"" is not a word. ""STOIC"" has C which is forbidden.

So, ""SUITE"" seems good.

Another word: ""STILE"" - S, T, I, L, E. That has L instead of U. L is a common consonant. But we are missing testing U. However, U is less common than I and O? But we need to test both eventually.

But with ""STILE"", we get S, T, I, L, E. That's four new letters: S, T, I, L.

Similarly, ""SUITE"" gives S, U, I, T, E.

I think both are acceptable. I'll go with ""STILE"" because it avoids the less common U and tests L which is common.

But we have to decide.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has double letters? But that might not be efficient for information.

I think I'll go with ""STOLE"" as I initially thought because it has O (a common vowel) and S, T, L (common consonants).

So, let's choose ""STOLE"".

But ""STOLE"" has O, which is a vowel we haven't tested, and it's common.

So, my next guess: ""STOLE""

But let me confirm: S at 1, T at 2, O at 3, L at 4, E at 5.

We know E is correct at 5, so we are testing positions 1-4 with S, T, O, L.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

So, I'll go with that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"" (C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)), we know:
- The secret word ends with ""E"" (5th letter is E).
- The letters C, R, A, and N are not in the secret word at all.

For the next guess:
- The word must end with ""E"" to leverage the known correct position.
- It should avoid the letters C, R, A, and N.
- To maximize information gain, the guess should include new, common English letters (e.g., S, T, O, L, I) to test their presence and positions.

A strong candidate is ""STOLE"":
- Ends with ""E"", confirming the 5th position.
- Uses new common letters: S, T, O, L (all untested and frequent in English).
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N).

This guess will provide feedback on the first four positions and help narrow down possible letters for the secret word.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. Since it's the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. 
A good starting word often has common letters and a variety of distinct letters to get more feedback.

Some popular starting words in Wordle are words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRAIN"", ""ROAST"", etc., because they contain common vowels and consonants.

I'll choose a word that has three common vowels and two common consonants to cover a lot of ground.

Let me choose: ""CRANE""

It has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' – a good mix of vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N). 

So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".I need to make the first guess in the Wordle game. Since I have no prior information, I'll choose a word that maximizes the potential information gain. A good starting word typically:
- Uses common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants
- Has no repeating letters
- Covers a diverse set of frequent English letters (e.g., R, S, T, N, L)

One word that fits these criteria and is often recommended in Wordle strategies is ""CRANE"". It contains:
- Two vowels (A and E)
- Common consonants (C, R, N)
- Five distinct letters

This will help me get feedback on commonly used letters and their positions efficiently.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"": 
C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)

This means:
- E is in the secret word and is in the correct position (at the end, since E is the 5th letter).
- C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.

So, we know:
- The secret word ends with E (5th letter is E).
- The letters C, R, A, N are absent.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: _ _ _ _ E

We must avoid using C, R, A, N in our next guess.

Now, we need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (to confirm or get more information about the position of E, but we already know it's at the end, so we can use E at the end to test other letters).
- Does not contain C, R, A, N.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Since E is fixed at the end, we can focus on the first four letters.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, B, etc.

We should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

A good candidate might be a word that has multiple common consonants and vowels that we haven't tested.

Let's consider words ending with E and without C, R, A, N.

Some options:
- ""SLATE"": but S, L, T are new, but A is already known to be absent (from feedback: A(x)), so we cannot use A. Similarly, we cannot use C, R, A, N.

So, we must avoid A. Therefore, ""SLATE"" is invalid because it has A.

Another option: ""SPIKE"" - has S, P, I, K, and ends with E. But we don't know if P, I, K are in the word. Also, it avoids the forbidden letters.

But we might want to include more common vowels. We haven't tested O, U, I, etc.

Another common word: ""STOLE"" - ends with E, and has S, T, O, L. All new letters.

But we must check if it's valid: no C, R, A, N. Yes.

Alternatively, ""SPIKE"" is also good.

But note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize information. ""STOLE"" covers S, T, O, L, and E (which we know). Similarly, ""SPIKE"" covers S, P, I, K, E.

Which one is better? Both are good, but ""STOLE"" has two vowels (O and E) and two common consonants (S, T, L). ""SPIKE"" has I (vowel) and P, K (less common than T and L?).

In terms of letter frequency in English, S and T are very common, then L, O. P and K are less common.

So, ""STOLE"" might be better because it uses more common letters.

But we must also consider that we are trying to find the word, and we know the last letter is E. So, we can try to get information about the first four positions.

Another candidate: ""SHINE"" - has S, H, I, N. But N is forbidden (we had N(x) in the first feedback). So, we cannot use N.

Similarly, ""SUITE"" - has S, U, I, T, E. No forbidden letters? Let's check: no C, R, A, N. So, that's valid.

""SUITE"" has S, U, I, T, E. That's four new letters: S, U, I, T.

But we already know E is at the end, so we are testing the first four with S, U, I, T.

Alternatively, ""STOLE"" has S, T, O, L, E.

I think both are good. Let me choose ""STOLE"" because it has O which is a common vowel.

But note: we have not tested I and U, which are also common vowels. However, we can test them in subsequent guesses.

Since we have limited tries, we should try to cover as many common letters as possible.

Another word: ""HOUSE"" - has H, O, U, S, E. But we already know E is at the end, so we are testing H, O, U, S. And it avoids C, R, A, N.

""HOUSE"" is a valid word.

But ""STOLE"" and ""HOUSE"" both have four new letters. ""STOLE"" has S, T, O, L. ""HOUSE"" has H, O, U, S.

S is common to both. T is more common than H and U? T is very common, H and U are less common.

But we need to test vowels: we haven't tested O, U, I. So, ""HOUSE"" tests two vowels (O and U) and one consonant (H) and S.

""STOLE"" tests one vowel (O) and three consonants (S, T, L).

Since we know the word has an E, and we don't know about other vowels, it might be good to test multiple vowels.

But the secret word might have only one vowel (E) and the rest consonants? But that's rare for 5-letter words. Typically, there are at least two vowels.

In our first guess, we had A and E, but A is absent. So, the secret word has E and at least one more vowel.

Therefore, testing two vowels in one guess might be efficient.

So, ""HOUSE"" tests O and U, which are two vowels we haven't tried.

Alternatively, ""SUITE"" tests U and I.

I think ""SUITE"" is a good option because it has U and I (two vowels) and S and T (two very common consonants).

So, let me go with ""SUITE"".

But wait, ""SUITE"" is S-U-I-T-E. The positions: S at 1, U at 2, I at 3, T at 4, E at 5.

We know E is correct at position 5, so we are testing the first four.

Another candidate: ""POISE"" - P, O, I, S, E. But P and O are new, but we avoid forbidden letters. However, we might prefer more common letters.

I think ""SUITE"" is a solid choice.

But let's check the frequency: S, T, I, U are all common.

I'll go with ""SUITE"".

Alternatively, to cover more common consonants, ""SLIME"" - but L, I, M, but we have S and E. But we don't know about M. However, we cannot use ""SLIME"" because it has M? But M is not forbidden. But we have to avoid C, R, A, N. ""SLIME"" has S, L, I, M, E. That's valid.

But ""SLIME"" has I and M, while ""SUITE"" has U, I, T. T is more common than M.

So, I think ""SUITE"" is better.

But note: we have E at the end, so we don't need to test E again? Actually, we can use E at the end to confirm, but we already know it's there, so it's fine.

I'll choose ""SUITE"".

But let me see if there's a word that uses more of the most common letters. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... but we know A and N are out, so T, O, I, S are good.

A word with T, O, I, S and E? But we have only five letters. ""TOISE"" is not a word. ""STOIC"" has C which is forbidden.

So, ""SUITE"" seems good.

Another word: ""STILE"" - S, T, I, L, E. That has L instead of U. L is a common consonant. But we are missing testing U. However, U is less common than I and O? But we need to test both eventually.

But with ""STILE"", we get S, T, I, L, E. That's four new letters: S, T, I, L.

Similarly, ""SUITE"" gives S, U, I, T, E.

I think both are acceptable. I'll go with ""STILE"" because it avoids the less common U and tests L which is common.

But we have to decide.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has double letters? But that might not be efficient for information.

I think I'll go with ""STOLE"" as I initially thought because it has O (a common vowel) and S, T, L (common consonants).

So, let's choose ""STOLE"".

But ""STOLE"" has O, which is a vowel we haven't tested, and it's common.

So, my next guess: ""STOLE""

But let me confirm: S at 1, T at 2, O at 3, L at 4, E at 5.

We know E is correct at 5, so we are testing positions 1-4 with S, T, O, L.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

So, I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"" (C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)), we know:
- The secret word ends with ""E"" (5th letter is E).
- The letters C, R, A, and N are not in the secret word at all.

For the next guess:
- The word must end with ""E"" to leverage the known correct position.
- It should avoid the letters C, R, A, and N.
- To maximize information gain, the guess should include new, common English letters (e.g., S, T, O, L, I) to test their presence and positions.

A strong candidate is ""STOLE"":
- Ends with ""E"", confirming the 5th position.
- Uses new common letters: S, T, O, L (all untested and frequent in English).
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N).

This guess will provide feedback on the first four positions and help narrow down possible letters for the secret word.

We have feedback from two guesses:

1. First guess ""CRANE"": 
   - C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
   - This tells us:
     - E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).
     - C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

2. Second guess ""STOLE"":
   - S(x), T(-), O(x), L(x), E(✓)
   - E(✓) confirms E is still correctly placed at the end.
   - T(-) means T is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
   - S(x), O(x), L(x) mean S, O, L are not in the word at all.

So now we know:
- The secret word ends with E (position 5 is E).
- T is in the word, but not in position 2.
- Letters that are absent: C, R, A, N, S, O, L.

We also know from the first round that only E is present and correct.

Since T is present but not in position 2, and the 5th position is E, we can deduce T must be in one of the first four positions but not position 2. However, positions 1, 3, or 4 are possible for T.

The word structure so far: _ _ _ _ E

We need to guess a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (to keep position 5 confirmed).
- Does not contain the absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, O, L.
- Must include T (since it's present) but not in position 2.
- Tests new common letters to get more information.

List of letters still unknown (not absent and not confirmed except E):
From absent letters: We know these are out: C, R, A, N, S, O, L.
From present letters: Only T and E are known to be in the word. And E is fixed at end.

Other letters we haven't tested:
Common letters include: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Since we have limited guesses, we should test frequently used letters.

The word must have T somewhere (positions 1, 3, or 4) and E at end.

We should avoid putting T in position 2 again since we know it's wrong there.

Possible positions for T: 1, 3, or 4.

We need to choose a word that tests letters efficiently.

Since T could be in multiple positions, we might try to place T in a different position and test other new letters.

A good candidate word might be one that places T in position 1 or 3 or 4 and adds new common letters.

Let me list some words that end in E and contain T, but not C,R,A,N,S,O,L.

Using common letters: I, U, M, P, D, etc.

Examples:
- ""TABLE"": but A is absent (from guess1), so A not allowed.
- ""TIMES"": S is absent (from guess2), not allowed.
- ""TUBE"": only 4 letters, not 5.
- ""TRUCE"": has R and C, which are absent. Not valid.
- ""THOSE"": O and S are absent? O is absent (from guess2), yes O(x), S(x). So not allowed.
- ""PRIDE"": P,R,I,D,E – R is absent. Out.
- So we need to avoid R, C, A, N, S, O, L.

Try words with T and E, and three other new letters.

Options:
- ""TITHE"": but has T twice? And H, I, E, but length: T,I,T,H,E – positions: T at 1 and 3? But we need 5 distinct? The game allows repeated letters? Actually, Wordle allows repeated letters, but in this case, secret word might have repeats? But feedback doesn't mark duplicates specially? Based on rules: if a letter is repeated, the feedback might handle it as per standard Wordle rules. But in the rules given, it's not specified, so we assume standard behavior.

However, since we have no indication of duplicates so far, and to maximize information, we might prefer a word with all distinct letters.

But no restriction in rules, so possible.

But for now, let's try to avoid repeats.

""TIMED"": M,E,D – but T,I,M,E,D – letters: T, I, M, E, D. E at end? We need the word to end with E.

""TIMED"" ends with D? No, it is T,I,M,E,D – position 5 is D, not E. We need to end with E.

So words ending with E.

""SUITE"": but S and U? S is absent, so no.

We need starting words.

Examples of words: 
- ""PIECE"": has E twice? P,I,E,C,E – and C is absent. Out.
- ""MILE"": not 5 letters.
- ""THINE"": H,I,N,E – N is absent. Out.
- ""WHITE"": W,H,I,T,E – letters: W,H,I,T,E. Ends with E. Avoids forbidden letters: C,R,A,N,S,O,L are not present? S,O,L are forbidden? S from guess2 is absent, O absent, L absent.

So ""WHITE"": W,H,I,T,E
- Positions: W at 1, H at 2, I at 3, T at 4, E at 5.

We know T is in the word, so having it at position 4 is good. We can see if it's correct or misplaced.

Also tests W, H, I.

Common letters: W,H,I.

Another option: ""QUITE"": Q,U,I,T,E – same positions: Q,U,I,T,E.

Q is less common, so might not be ideal.

""EXIST"": has S and X? S is absent.

""OFFER"": no E at end.

""TOUCH"": no E.

Focus on words ending in E.

List: 
- ""THIEF"": T,H,I,E,F – but ends with F? T,H,I,E,F – position 5 is F, not E. We need the word to have E at position 5.

""ABIDE"": has A, and B,I,D,E – but A is absent.

""GLIDE"": has G,L,I,D,E – but L is absent (L(x) in guess2).

""PRIME"": P,R,I,M,E – R is absent.

""DWINE"": not common, D,W,I,N,E – N is absent.

So, ""WHITE"" seems possible.

""PHONE"": has O and N? O absent, N absent.

""SHIRE"": has S and R? Both absent.

Another word: ""WRITE"": W,R,I,T,E – R is absent, so invalid.

""UNTIE"": U,N,T,I,E – N absent.

""QUOTE"": O absent.

""EVITE"": E at start, not end? E,V,I,T,E – has E at start and end, but position 5 is E, so that's fine. Letters: E,V,I,T,E. So E repeated.

But in feedback, for secret word BRISk in example, no issue with repeats? But let's assume it's valid.

""EVITE"" might not be common; ""EVITE"" means to avoid? Less common.

""THYME"": T,H,Y,M,E – ends with E. Letters: T,H,Y,M,E. Not common letters, but possible.

Better to use common vowels: I,U.

""GUISE"": G,U,I,S,E – S absent.

""BIOME"": B,I,O,M,E – O absent.

So, hard to find words with common letters avoiding the absents.

""WHITE"" is acceptable: W,H,I,T,E.

But W and H are not very common, so might not yield much.

""DIODE"": D,I,O,D,E – O absent and repeated D? Not good.

Another: ""FIGHT"": no E.

""JUDGE"": no E.

""FENCE"": F,E,N,C,E – N and C absent.

Perhaps ""CHIME"": C and H? C absent.

Back to ""EVITE"": E,V,I,T,E – but E at position 1 and 5. We know position 5 is E, so we don't need to test E again? But we can. Actually, using E at position 1 could give information if E is elsewhere? But we think E is only at end? Secret word might have multiple E's? Possible.

Similarly, T we know is present once, but might be more.

But to avoid complexity, perhaps assume no duplicates for now.

But let's calculate: the feedback for repeated letters. In Wordle, if a letter is repeated in guess and secret has it once, only one may be marked. But rules here don't specify, but assume standard: feedback marks each letter only as it corresponds to positions.

For example, secret BRISK, guess S T O R M: S(-) because S is in word but wrong position, etc, no indication on duplicates handling.

But to play safe, avoid repeats if possible.

So, ""WHITE"" seems good.

Another word: ""TICKE"" - not a word.

""TIMED"" not ends with E.

Perhaps ""THREE"": T,H,R,E,E – R absent and E repeated.

Out.

""TWINE"": T,W,I,N,E – N absent.

""PRICE"": P,R,I,C,E – R and C absent.

So, ""WHITE"" is one of our best bets.

Use ""KIITE"" - not a word.

Another common word: ""BITE"" - only 4 letters.

""UNITE"": U,N,I,T,E – N absent.

But we haven't tried U and I.

""QUITE"": Q,U,I,T,E – Q is rare, but U and I are common vowels. But Q might be wasted if not present.

However, Q and U are tested, but Q is infrequent.

Perhaps ""WHITE"" or ""EVITE"", but ""EVITE"" is obscure.

Another word: ""PETITE"" - too long.

5 letters: HYPHE - not common.

Better to go with ""WHITE"".

Or ""THIEF"" doesn't end in E.

""MINED"" ends in D, not E.

Let's think differently. Since E is at end, and T must be in 1,3, or 4, consider words with T at different positions.

Position 1: T _ _ _ E
Position 4: _ _ _ T E
Position 3: _ _ T _ E

Also, must include new letters.

With T at position 4: words ending with ""TE"", like ""WRITE"", but R absent. ""LITE"" too short. ""SITE"" S absent. ""MITE"" M,I,T,E – but only 4 letters if not specified? ""SMITE"" has S absent.

""ELITE"": E,L,I,T,E – L absent and E repeated.

""QUOTE"": O absent.

So few options.

With T at position 3: _ _ T _ E
Like ""CUTE"" too short. ""EXUTE"" not a word. ""PATTY"" no E. ""BITTY"" no E.
Possible words: ""MITRE"" M,I,T,R,E – R absent.
""FITRE"" not word.
""TITER"" has R.

Not good.

With T at position 1: T _ _ _ E
Examples: ""TABLE"" A absent.
""TIMED"" ends with D.
""TRACE"" R and C absent.
""TRIBE"" R absent.
""TIDES"" S and D? S absent.
""TIGER"" R absent.

""THYME"" as before: T,H,Y,M,E
""THYME"" is a word, letters: T,H,Y,M,E. No forbidden letters. H, Y, M are new.
But Y is less common.

""THYME"" is a valid English word.

Another: ""TIFFE"" not common.

""WHITE"" is T _ _ _ E but with T at 4? ""WHITE"" is W,H,I,T,E so position 4 is T.

In ""WHITE"", T is at position 4, which is new position to test.

Similarly, ""UNTIE"" but has N absent.

So, among the options, ""WHITE"" and ""THYME"" are candidates.

I think ""WHITE"" is better because it has I, a common vowel, whereas ""THYME"" has Y which is less common.

So, let's go with ""WHITE"".

Guessing ""WHITE"":
- W at position 1: new
- H at position 2: new
- I at position 3: new
- T at position 4: we know T is in the word, testing if at position 4
- E at position 5: confirmed already

So it tests W, H, I, and T at position 4.

If T is at position 4, it will show correct or misplaced.

Also, if any of W, H, I are in the word, we get feedback.

But there are other positions for T: position 1 or 3 are also possible.

But for now, ""WHITE"" seems reasonable.

To cover position 1, we could use a word with T at 1, like ""TIMED"" but doesn't end with E.

What about ""TWIRE"" not a word.

""THEME"": T,H,E,M,E – E repeated and E at position 3? T at 1, H at 2, E at 3, M at 4, E at 5. E at position 3 and 5. But we know E is at 5, so E at position 3 would be additional? Possible. Letters: T,H,E,M,E – so E and M. But we test E at 3, which may be present or not.

But feedback from second guess must be considered: E is only at position 5, so if we put E elsewhere, it might be marked as absent if not in the secret except at 5.

In ""THEME"", for position 1: T, position 2: H, position 3: E, position 4: M, position 5: E.

We know position 3 could be E or not? Secret might have E only at 5 or at other positions too.

But from available information, not necessarily duplicate E.

In ""THEME"", if secret has only one E at position 5, then the E at position 3 might be absent or marked wrong position? Since E is in the word but position is wrong.

But let's see feedback rules: if letter in word wrong position: marked as ""-""

If letter not in word: marked ""x""

If letter is in word and correct position: ""✓""

For ""THEME"", at position 5: E is known to be correct, so it would be ""✓"" 
At position 3: E could be ""-"" if secret has E at 5 but not at 3, and no other E? Secret has only one E? Or two? We don't know.

If secret has only one E at position 5, then E at position 3 should be marked ""x"" because it's not in the word elsewhere? Actually, feedback would mark E at 3 as not present if no other E positions.

Standard Wordle rule for duplicate letters: the feedback indicates presence based on oCcurrences. For example, if secret has one E and guess has two E's, one in wrong position and one correct, the correct position gets ""✓"", the other E may be marked as not present if not in other positions? Or if one is correct, the additional is not present if secret has only one.

Yes, typically: the correct position is prioritized, then for remaining, indicate presence for wrong position.

But the rules here don't specify, but we should assume standard Wordle behavior.

To avoid confusion, it might be better to use a word without repeating letters.

Therefore, ""WHITE"" is better: all different letters.

So, I choose ""WHITE"".
</think>
**Step-by-step reasoning:**

- From **Guess 1: CRANE → FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)**  
  - **E is in the secret word and correctly positioned at the end (5th letter)**.  
  - **C, R, A, N are absent from the secret word**.  
  - Therefore, the secret word ends with E and does not contain C, R, A, or N.  

- From **Guess 2: STOLE → FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) O(x) L(x) E(✓)**  
  - **E(✓) is reconfirmed at position 5** (no change).  
  - **T(-) means T is in the secret word but not in position 2**.  
  - **S, O, L are absent** (added to the list of forbidden letters).  
  - Since T is present but misplaced in position 2, it must be in position 1, 3, or 4 of the secret word.  
  - Absent letters now are: **C, R, A, N, S, O, L**.  

**Summary of known information:**  
- The secret word has the format: `_ _ _ _ E`.  
- T is present but incorrectly positioned at 2, so it must be at position 1, 3, or 4.  
- Letters confirmed absent: **C, R, A, N, S, O, L**.  
- Available common letters to test (not yet tried): **B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, Y**, etc.  
- E at position 5 is fixed and known; do not need to retest it unnecessarily.  

**Strategy for next guess:**  
- Choose a word ending with **E** to leverage the known correct position.  
- Include **T** in a position not yet tested (position 1, 3, or 4—avoiding position 2).  
- Prioritize testing new high-frequency letters to maximize information gain: e.g., **I** (vowel) and **H**, **M**, **P** (common consonants).  
- Ensure the word contains no absent letters (C, R, A, N, S, O, L).  
- Avoid repeating letters to increase information efficiency (no duplicates).  

**Candidate word: WHITE**  
- **W** (new consonant) at position 1.  
- **H** (new consonant) at position 2 (testing if T was misplaced here; H could be present).  
- **I** (new vowel) at position 3 (valuable to test vowels).  
- **T** (known present) at position 4 (testing if T is correctly placed here).  
- **E** at position 5 (fixed, known correct).  
- **Fits all criteria**: Ends with E; includes T in an untested position (4); avoids forbidden letters; tests new common letters (W, H, I).  

This guess will provide feedback on the presence/position of T at position 4 and introduce three new letters, helping narrow down possibilities significantly.  

<guess>WHITE</guess>",WHITE,"We have feedback from two guesses:

1. First guess ""CRANE"": 
   - C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
   - This tells us:
     - E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).
     - C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

2. Second guess ""STOLE"":
   - S(x), T(-), O(x), L(x), E(✓)
   - E(✓) confirms E is still correctly placed at the end.
   - T(-) means T is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
   - S(x), O(x), L(x) mean S, O, L are not in the word at all.

So now we know:
- The secret word ends with E (position 5 is E).
- T is in the word, but not in position 2.
- Letters that are absent: C, R, A, N, S, O, L.

We also know from the first round that only E is present and correct.

Since T is present but not in position 2, and the 5th position is E, we can deduce T must be in one of the first four positions but not position 2. However, positions 1, 3, or 4 are possible for T.

The word structure so far: _ _ _ _ E

We need to guess a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (to keep position 5 confirmed).
- Does not contain the absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, O, L.
- Must include T (since it's present) but not in position 2.
- Tests new common letters to get more information.

List of letters still unknown (not absent and not confirmed except E):
From absent letters: We know these are out: C, R, A, N, S, O, L.
From present letters: Only T and E are known to be in the word. And E is fixed at end.

Other letters we haven't tested:
Common letters include: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Since we have limited guesses, we should test frequently used letters.

The word must have T somewhere (positions 1, 3, or 4) and E at end.

We should avoid putting T in position 2 again since we know it's wrong there.

Possible positions for T: 1, 3, or 4.

We need to choose a word that tests letters efficiently.

Since T could be in multiple positions, we might try to place T in a different position and test other new letters.

A good candidate word might be one that places T in position 1 or 3 or 4 and adds new common letters.

Let me list some words that end in E and contain T, but not C,R,A,N,S,O,L.

Using common letters: I, U, M, P, D, etc.

Examples:
- ""TABLE"": but A is absent (from guess1), so A not allowed.
- ""TIMES"": S is absent (from guess2), not allowed.
- ""TUBE"": only 4 letters, not 5.
- ""TRUCE"": has R and C, which are absent. Not valid.
- ""THOSE"": O and S are absent? O is absent (from guess2), yes O(x), S(x). So not allowed.
- ""PRIDE"": P,R,I,D,E – R is absent. Out.
- So we need to avoid R, C, A, N, S, O, L.

Try words with T and E, and three other new letters.

Options:
- ""TITHE"": but has T twice? And H, I, E, but length: T,I,T,H,E – positions: T at 1 and 3? But we need 5 distinct? The game allows repeated letters? Actually, Wordle allows repeated letters, but in this case, secret word might have repeats? But feedback doesn't mark duplicates specially? Based on rules: if a letter is repeated, the feedback might handle it as per standard Wordle rules. But in the rules given, it's not specified, so we assume standard behavior.

However, since we have no indication of duplicates so far, and to maximize information, we might prefer a word with all distinct letters.

But no restriction in rules, so possible.

But for now, let's try to avoid repeats.

""TIMED"": M,E,D – but T,I,M,E,D – letters: T, I, M, E, D. E at end? We need the word to end with E.

""TIMED"" ends with D? No, it is T,I,M,E,D – position 5 is D, not E. We need to end with E.

So words ending with E.

""SUITE"": but S and U? S is absent, so no.

We need starting words.

Examples of words: 
- ""PIECE"": has E twice? P,I,E,C,E – and C is absent. Out.
- ""MILE"": not 5 letters.
- ""THINE"": H,I,N,E – N is absent. Out.
- ""WHITE"": W,H,I,T,E – letters: W,H,I,T,E. Ends with E. Avoids forbidden letters: C,R,A,N,S,O,L are not present? S,O,L are forbidden? S from guess2 is absent, O absent, L absent.

So ""WHITE"": W,H,I,T,E
- Positions: W at 1, H at 2, I at 3, T at 4, E at 5.

We know T is in the word, so having it at position 4 is good. We can see if it's correct or misplaced.

Also tests W, H, I.

Common letters: W,H,I.

Another option: ""QUITE"": Q,U,I,T,E – same positions: Q,U,I,T,E.

Q is less common, so might not be ideal.

""EXIST"": has S and X? S is absent.

""OFFER"": no E at end.

""TOUCH"": no E.

Focus on words ending in E.

List: 
- ""THIEF"": T,H,I,E,F – but ends with F? T,H,I,E,F – position 5 is F, not E. We need the word to have E at position 5.

""ABIDE"": has A, and B,I,D,E – but A is absent.

""GLIDE"": has G,L,I,D,E – but L is absent (L(x) in guess2).

""PRIME"": P,R,I,M,E – R is absent.

""DWINE"": not common, D,W,I,N,E – N is absent.

So, ""WHITE"" seems possible.

""PHONE"": has O and N? O absent, N absent.

""SHIRE"": has S and R? Both absent.

Another word: ""WRITE"": W,R,I,T,E – R is absent, so invalid.

""UNTIE"": U,N,T,I,E – N absent.

""QUOTE"": O absent.

""EVITE"": E at start, not end? E,V,I,T,E – has E at start and end, but position 5 is E, so that's fine. Letters: E,V,I,T,E. So E repeated.

But in feedback, for secret word BRISk in example, no issue with repeats? But let's assume it's valid.

""EVITE"" might not be common; ""EVITE"" means to avoid? Less common.

""THYME"": T,H,Y,M,E – ends with E. Letters: T,H,Y,M,E. Not common letters, but possible.

Better to use common vowels: I,U.

""GUISE"": G,U,I,S,E – S absent.

""BIOME"": B,I,O,M,E – O absent.

So, hard to find words with common letters avoiding the absents.

""WHITE"" is acceptable: W,H,I,T,E.

But W and H are not very common, so might not yield much.

""DIODE"": D,I,O,D,E – O absent and repeated D? Not good.

Another: ""FIGHT"": no E.

""JUDGE"": no E.

""FENCE"": F,E,N,C,E – N and C absent.

Perhaps ""CHIME"": C and H? C absent.

Back to ""EVITE"": E,V,I,T,E – but E at position 1 and 5. We know position 5 is E, so we don't need to test E again? But we can. Actually, using E at position 1 could give information if E is elsewhere? But we think E is only at end? Secret word might have multiple E's? Possible.

Similarly, T we know is present once, but might be more.

But to avoid complexity, perhaps assume no duplicates for now.

But let's calculate: the feedback for repeated letters. In Wordle, if a letter is repeated in guess and secret has it once, only one may be marked. But rules here don't specify, but assume standard: feedback marks each letter only as it corresponds to positions.

For example, secret BRISK, guess S T O R M: S(-) because S is in word but wrong position, etc, no indication on duplicates handling.

But to play safe, avoid repeats if possible.

So, ""WHITE"" seems good.

Another word: ""TICKE"" - not a word.

""TIMED"" not ends with E.

Perhaps ""THREE"": T,H,R,E,E – R absent and E repeated.

Out.

""TWINE"": T,W,I,N,E – N absent.

""PRICE"": P,R,I,C,E – R and C absent.

So, ""WHITE"" is one of our best bets.

Use ""KIITE"" - not a word.

Another common word: ""BITE"" - only 4 letters.

""UNITE"": U,N,I,T,E – N absent.

But we haven't tried U and I.

""QUITE"": Q,U,I,T,E – Q is rare, but U and I are common vowels. But Q might be wasted if not present.

However, Q and U are tested, but Q is infrequent.

Perhaps ""WHITE"" or ""EVITE"", but ""EVITE"" is obscure.

Another word: ""PETITE"" - too long.

5 letters: HYPHE - not common.

Better to go with ""WHITE"".

Or ""THIEF"" doesn't end in E.

""MINED"" ends in D, not E.

Let's think differently. Since E is at end, and T must be in 1,3, or 4, consider words with T at different positions.

Position 1: T _ _ _ E
Position 4: _ _ _ T E
Position 3: _ _ T _ E

Also, must include new letters.

With T at position 4: words ending with ""TE"", like ""WRITE"", but R absent. ""LITE"" too short. ""SITE"" S absent. ""MITE"" M,I,T,E – but only 4 letters if not specified? ""SMITE"" has S absent.

""ELITE"": E,L,I,T,E – L absent and E repeated.

""QUOTE"": O absent.

So few options.

With T at position 3: _ _ T _ E
Like ""CUTE"" too short. ""EXUTE"" not a word. ""PATTY"" no E. ""BITTY"" no E.
Possible words: ""MITRE"" M,I,T,R,E – R absent.
""FITRE"" not word.
""TITER"" has R.

Not good.

With T at position 1: T _ _ _ E
Examples: ""TABLE"" A absent.
""TIMED"" ends with D.
""TRACE"" R and C absent.
""TRIBE"" R absent.
""TIDES"" S and D? S absent.
""TIGER"" R absent.

""THYME"" as before: T,H,Y,M,E
""THYME"" is a word, letters: T,H,Y,M,E. No forbidden letters. H, Y, M are new.
But Y is less common.

""THYME"" is a valid English word.

Another: ""TIFFE"" not common.

""WHITE"" is T _ _ _ E but with T at 4? ""WHITE"" is W,H,I,T,E so position 4 is T.

In ""WHITE"", T is at position 4, which is new position to test.

Similarly, ""UNTIE"" but has N absent.

So, among the options, ""WHITE"" and ""THYME"" are candidates.

I think ""WHITE"" is better because it has I, a common vowel, whereas ""THYME"" has Y which is less common.

So, let's go with ""WHITE"".

Guessing ""WHITE"":
- W at position 1: new
- H at position 2: new
- I at position 3: new
- T at position 4: we know T is in the word, testing if at position 4
- E at position 5: confirmed already

So it tests W, H, I, and T at position 4.

If T is at position 4, it will show correct or misplaced.

Also, if any of W, H, I are in the word, we get feedback.

But there are other positions for T: position 1 or 3 are also possible.

But for now, ""WHITE"" seems reasonable.

To cover position 1, we could use a word with T at 1, like ""TIMED"" but doesn't end with E.

What about ""TWIRE"" not a word.

""THEME"": T,H,E,M,E – E repeated and E at position 3? T at 1, H at 2, E at 3, M at 4, E at 5. E at position 3 and 5. But we know E is at 5, so E at position 3 would be additional? Possible. Letters: T,H,E,M,E – so E and M. But we test E at 3, which may be present or not.

But feedback from second guess must be considered: E is only at position 5, so if we put E elsewhere, it might be marked as absent if not in the secret except at 5.

In ""THEME"", for position 1: T, position 2: H, position 3: E, position 4: M, position 5: E.

We know position 3 could be E or not? Secret might have E only at 5 or at other positions too.

But from available information, not necessarily duplicate E.

In ""THEME"", if secret has only one E at position 5, then the E at position 3 might be absent or marked wrong position? Since E is in the word but position is wrong.

But let's see feedback rules: if letter in word wrong position: marked as ""-""

If letter not in word: marked ""x""

If letter is in word and correct position: ""✓""

For ""THEME"", at position 5: E is known to be correct, so it would be ""✓"" 
At position 3: E could be ""-"" if secret has E at 5 but not at 3, and no other E? Secret has only one E? Or two? We don't know.

If secret has only one E at position 5, then E at position 3 should be marked ""x"" because it's not in the word elsewhere? Actually, feedback would mark E at 3 as not present if no other E positions.

Standard Wordle rule for duplicate letters: the feedback indicates presence based on oCcurrences. For example, if secret has one E and guess has two E's, one in wrong position and one correct, the correct position gets ""✓"", the other E may be marked as not present if not in other positions? Or if one is correct, the additional is not present if secret has only one.

Yes, typically: the correct position is prioritized, then for remaining, indicate presence for wrong position.

But the rules here don't specify, but we should assume standard Wordle behavior.

To avoid confusion, it might be better to use a word without repeating letters.

Therefore, ""WHITE"" is better: all different letters.

So, I choose ""WHITE"".**Step-by-step reasoning:**

- From **Guess 1: CRANE → FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)**  
  - **E is in the secret word and correctly positioned at the end (5th letter)**.

  - Therefore, the secret word ends with E and does not contain C, R, A, or N.  

- From **Guess 2: STOLE → FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) O(x) L(x) E(✓)**  
  - **E(✓) is reconfirmed at position 5** (no change).  
  - **T(-) means T is in the secret word but not in position 2**.  
  - **S, O, L are absent** (added to the list of forbidden letters).  
  - Since T is present but misplaced in position 2, it must be in position 1, 3, or 4 of the secret word.  
  - Absent letters now are: **C, R, A, N, S, O, L**.  

**Summary of known information:**  
- The secret word has the format: `_ _ _ _ E`.  
- T is present but incorrectly positioned at 2, so it must be at position 1, 3, or 4.  
- Letters confirmed absent: **C, R, A, N, S, O, L**.

- Ensure the word contains no absent letters (C, R, A, N, S, O, L).  
- Avoid repeating letters to increase information efficiency (no duplicates).  

**Candidate word: WHITE**

- **E** at position 5 (fixed, known correct).  
- **Fits all criteria**: Ends with E; includes T in an untested position (4); avoids forbidden letters; tests new common letters (W, H, I).

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,thyme,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. Since it's the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. 
A good starting word often has common letters and a variety of distinct letters to get more feedback.

Some popular starting words in Wordle are words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRAIN"", ""ROAST"", etc., because they contain common vowels and consonants.

I'll choose a word that has three common vowels and two common consonants to cover a lot of ground.

Let me choose: ""CRANE""

It has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' – a good mix of vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N). 

So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".I need to make the first guess in the Wordle game. Since I have no prior information, I'll choose a word that maximizes the potential information gain. A good starting word typically:
- Uses common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants
- Has no repeating letters
- Covers a diverse set of frequent English letters (e.g., R, S, T, N, L)

One word that fits these criteria and is often recommended in Wordle strategies is ""CRANE"". It contains:
- Two vowels (A and E)
- Common consonants (C, R, N)
- Five distinct letters

This will help me get feedback on commonly used letters and their positions efficiently.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"": 
C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)

This means:
- E is in the secret word and is in the correct position (at the end, since E is the 5th letter).
- C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.

So, we know:
- The secret word ends with E (5th letter is E).
- The letters C, R, A, N are absent.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: _ _ _ _ E

We must avoid using C, R, A, N in our next guess.

Now, we need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (to confirm or get more information about the position of E, but we already know it's at the end, so we can use E at the end to test other letters).
- Does not contain C, R, A, N.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Since E is fixed at the end, we can focus on the first four letters.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, B, etc.

We should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

A good candidate might be a word that has multiple common consonants and vowels that we haven't tested.

Let's consider words ending with E and without C, R, A, N.

Some options:
- ""SLATE"": but S, L, T are new, but A is already known to be absent (from feedback: A(x)), so we cannot use A. Similarly, we cannot use C, R, A, N.

So, we must avoid A. Therefore, ""SLATE"" is invalid because it has A.

Another option: ""SPIKE"" - has S, P, I, K, and ends with E. But we don't know if P, I, K are in the word. Also, it avoids the forbidden letters.

But we might want to include more common vowels. We haven't tested O, U, I, etc.

Another common word: ""STOLE"" - ends with E, and has S, T, O, L. All new letters.

But we must check if it's valid: no C, R, A, N. Yes.

Alternatively, ""SPIKE"" is also good.

But note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize information. ""STOLE"" covers S, T, O, L, and E (which we know). Similarly, ""SPIKE"" covers S, P, I, K, E.

Which one is better? Both are good, but ""STOLE"" has two vowels (O and E) and two common consonants (S, T, L). ""SPIKE"" has I (vowel) and P, K (less common than T and L?).

In terms of letter frequency in English, S and T are very common, then L, O. P and K are less common.

So, ""STOLE"" might be better because it uses more common letters.

But we must also consider that we are trying to find the word, and we know the last letter is E. So, we can try to get information about the first four positions.

Another candidate: ""SHINE"" - has S, H, I, N. But N is forbidden (we had N(x) in the first feedback). So, we cannot use N.

Similarly, ""SUITE"" - has S, U, I, T, E. No forbidden letters? Let's check: no C, R, A, N. So, that's valid.

""SUITE"" has S, U, I, T, E. That's four new letters: S, U, I, T.

But we already know E is at the end, so we are testing the first four with S, U, I, T.

Alternatively, ""STOLE"" has S, T, O, L, E.

I think both are good. Let me choose ""STOLE"" because it has O which is a common vowel.

But note: we have not tested I and U, which are also common vowels. However, we can test them in subsequent guesses.

Since we have limited tries, we should try to cover as many common letters as possible.

Another word: ""HOUSE"" - has H, O, U, S, E. But we already know E is at the end, so we are testing H, O, U, S. And it avoids C, R, A, N.

""HOUSE"" is a valid word.

But ""STOLE"" and ""HOUSE"" both have four new letters. ""STOLE"" has S, T, O, L. ""HOUSE"" has H, O, U, S.

S is common to both. T is more common than H and U? T is very common, H and U are less common.

But we need to test vowels: we haven't tested O, U, I. So, ""HOUSE"" tests two vowels (O and U) and one consonant (H) and S.

""STOLE"" tests one vowel (O) and three consonants (S, T, L).

Since we know the word has an E, and we don't know about other vowels, it might be good to test multiple vowels.

But the secret word might have only one vowel (E) and the rest consonants? But that's rare for 5-letter words. Typically, there are at least two vowels.

In our first guess, we had A and E, but A is absent. So, the secret word has E and at least one more vowel.

Therefore, testing two vowels in one guess might be efficient.

So, ""HOUSE"" tests O and U, which are two vowels we haven't tried.

Alternatively, ""SUITE"" tests U and I.

I think ""SUITE"" is a good option because it has U and I (two vowels) and S and T (two very common consonants).

So, let me go with ""SUITE"".

But wait, ""SUITE"" is S-U-I-T-E. The positions: S at 1, U at 2, I at 3, T at 4, E at 5.

We know E is correct at position 5, so we are testing the first four.

Another candidate: ""POISE"" - P, O, I, S, E. But P and O are new, but we avoid forbidden letters. However, we might prefer more common letters.

I think ""SUITE"" is a solid choice.

But let's check the frequency: S, T, I, U are all common.

I'll go with ""SUITE"".

Alternatively, to cover more common consonants, ""SLIME"" - but L, I, M, but we have S and E. But we don't know about M. However, we cannot use ""SLIME"" because it has M? But M is not forbidden. But we have to avoid C, R, A, N. ""SLIME"" has S, L, I, M, E. That's valid.

But ""SLIME"" has I and M, while ""SUITE"" has U, I, T. T is more common than M.

So, I think ""SUITE"" is better.

But note: we have E at the end, so we don't need to test E again? Actually, we can use E at the end to confirm, but we already know it's there, so it's fine.

I'll choose ""SUITE"".

But let me see if there's a word that uses more of the most common letters. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... but we know A and N are out, so T, O, I, S are good.

A word with T, O, I, S and E? But we have only five letters. ""TOISE"" is not a word. ""STOIC"" has C which is forbidden.

So, ""SUITE"" seems good.

Another word: ""STILE"" - S, T, I, L, E. That has L instead of U. L is a common consonant. But we are missing testing U. However, U is less common than I and O? But we need to test both eventually.

But with ""STILE"", we get S, T, I, L, E. That's four new letters: S, T, I, L.

Similarly, ""SUITE"" gives S, U, I, T, E.

I think both are acceptable. I'll go with ""STILE"" because it avoids the less common U and tests L which is common.

But we have to decide.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has double letters? But that might not be efficient for information.

I think I'll go with ""STOLE"" as I initially thought because it has O (a common vowel) and S, T, L (common consonants).

So, let's choose ""STOLE"".

But ""STOLE"" has O, which is a vowel we haven't tested, and it's common.

So, my next guess: ""STOLE""

But let me confirm: S at 1, T at 2, O at 3, L at 4, E at 5.

We know E is correct at 5, so we are testing positions 1-4 with S, T, O, L.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

So, I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"" (C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)), we know:
- The secret word ends with ""E"" (5th letter is E).
- The letters C, R, A, and N are not in the secret word at all.

For the next guess:
- The word must end with ""E"" to leverage the known correct position.
- It should avoid the letters C, R, A, and N.
- To maximize information gain, the guess should include new, common English letters (e.g., S, T, O, L, I) to test their presence and positions.

A strong candidate is ""STOLE"":
- Ends with ""E"", confirming the 5th position.
- Uses new common letters: S, T, O, L (all untested and frequent in English).
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N).

This guess will provide feedback on the first four positions and help narrow down possible letters for the secret word.

<guess>STOLE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: STOLE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) O(x) L(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

1. First guess ""CRANE"": 
   - C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
   - This tells us:
     - E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).
     - C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

2. Second guess ""STOLE"":
   - S(x), T(-), O(x), L(x), E(✓)
   - E(✓) confirms E is still correctly placed at the end.
   - T(-) means T is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
   - S(x), O(x), L(x) mean S, O, L are not in the word at all.

So now we know:
- The secret word ends with E (position 5 is E).
- T is in the word, but not in position 2.
- Letters that are absent: C, R, A, N, S, O, L.

We also know from the first round that only E is present and correct.

Since T is present but not in position 2, and the 5th position is E, we can deduce T must be in one of the first four positions but not position 2. However, positions 1, 3, or 4 are possible for T.

The word structure so far: _ _ _ _ E

We need to guess a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (to keep position 5 confirmed).
- Does not contain the absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, O, L.
- Must include T (since it's present) but not in position 2.
- Tests new common letters to get more information.

List of letters still unknown (not absent and not confirmed except E):
From absent letters: We know these are out: C, R, A, N, S, O, L.
From present letters: Only T and E are known to be in the word. And E is fixed at end.

Other letters we haven't tested:
Common letters include: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Since we have limited guesses, we should test frequently used letters.

The word must have T somewhere (positions 1, 3, or 4) and E at end.

We should avoid putting T in position 2 again since we know it's wrong there.

Possible positions for T: 1, 3, or 4.

We need to choose a word that tests letters efficiently.

Since T could be in multiple positions, we might try to place T in a different position and test other new letters.

A good candidate word might be one that places T in position 1 or 3 or 4 and adds new common letters.

Let me list some words that end in E and contain T, but not C,R,A,N,S,O,L.

Using common letters: I, U, M, P, D, etc.

Examples:
- ""TABLE"": but A is absent (from guess1), so A not allowed.
- ""TIMES"": S is absent (from guess2), not allowed.
- ""TUBE"": only 4 letters, not 5.
- ""TRUCE"": has R and C, which are absent. Not valid.
- ""THOSE"": O and S are absent? O is absent (from guess2), yes O(x), S(x). So not allowed.
- ""PRIDE"": P,R,I,D,E – R is absent. Out.
- So we need to avoid R, C, A, N, S, O, L.

Try words with T and E, and three other new letters.

Options:
- ""TITHE"": but has T twice? And H, I, E, but length: T,I,T,H,E – positions: T at 1 and 3? But we need 5 distinct? The game allows repeated letters? Actually, Wordle allows repeated letters, but in this case, secret word might have repeats? But feedback doesn't mark duplicates specially? Based on rules: if a letter is repeated, the feedback might handle it as per standard Wordle rules. But in the rules given, it's not specified, so we assume standard behavior.

However, since we have no indication of duplicates so far, and to maximize information, we might prefer a word with all distinct letters.

But no restriction in rules, so possible.

But for now, let's try to avoid repeats.

""TIMED"": M,E,D – but T,I,M,E,D – letters: T, I, M, E, D. E at end? We need the word to end with E.

""TIMED"" ends with D? No, it is T,I,M,E,D – position 5 is D, not E. We need to end with E.

So words ending with E.

""SUITE"": but S and U? S is absent, so no.

We need starting words.

Examples of words: 
- ""PIECE"": has E twice? P,I,E,C,E – and C is absent. Out.
- ""MILE"": not 5 letters.
- ""THINE"": H,I,N,E – N is absent. Out.
- ""WHITE"": W,H,I,T,E – letters: W,H,I,T,E. Ends with E. Avoids forbidden letters: C,R,A,N,S,O,L are not present? S,O,L are forbidden? S from guess2 is absent, O absent, L absent.

So ""WHITE"": W,H,I,T,E
- Positions: W at 1, H at 2, I at 3, T at 4, E at 5.

We know T is in the word, so having it at position 4 is good. We can see if it's correct or misplaced.

Also tests W, H, I.

Common letters: W,H,I.

Another option: ""QUITE"": Q,U,I,T,E – same positions: Q,U,I,T,E.

Q is less common, so might not be ideal.

""EXIST"": has S and X? S is absent.

""OFFER"": no E at end.

""TOUCH"": no E.

Focus on words ending in E.

List: 
- ""THIEF"": T,H,I,E,F – but ends with F? T,H,I,E,F – position 5 is F, not E. We need the word to have E at position 5.

""ABIDE"": has A, and B,I,D,E – but A is absent.

""GLIDE"": has G,L,I,D,E – but L is absent (L(x) in guess2).

""PRIME"": P,R,I,M,E – R is absent.

""DWINE"": not common, D,W,I,N,E – N is absent.

So, ""WHITE"" seems possible.

""PHONE"": has O and N? O absent, N absent.

""SHIRE"": has S and R? Both absent.

Another word: ""WRITE"": W,R,I,T,E – R is absent, so invalid.

""UNTIE"": U,N,T,I,E – N absent.

""QUOTE"": O absent.

""EVITE"": E at start, not end? E,V,I,T,E – has E at start and end, but position 5 is E, so that's fine. Letters: E,V,I,T,E. So E repeated.

But in feedback, for secret word BRISk in example, no issue with repeats? But let's assume it's valid.

""EVITE"" might not be common; ""EVITE"" means to avoid? Less common.

""THYME"": T,H,Y,M,E – ends with E. Letters: T,H,Y,M,E. Not common letters, but possible.

Better to use common vowels: I,U.

""GUISE"": G,U,I,S,E – S absent.

""BIOME"": B,I,O,M,E – O absent.

So, hard to find words with common letters avoiding the absents.

""WHITE"" is acceptable: W,H,I,T,E.

But W and H are not very common, so might not yield much.

""DIODE"": D,I,O,D,E – O absent and repeated D? Not good.

Another: ""FIGHT"": no E.

""JUDGE"": no E.

""FENCE"": F,E,N,C,E – N and C absent.

Perhaps ""CHIME"": C and H? C absent.

Back to ""EVITE"": E,V,I,T,E – but E at position 1 and 5. We know position 5 is E, so we don't need to test E again? But we can. Actually, using E at position 1 could give information if E is elsewhere? But we think E is only at end? Secret word might have multiple E's? Possible.

Similarly, T we know is present once, but might be more.

But to avoid complexity, perhaps assume no duplicates for now.

But let's calculate: the feedback for repeated letters. In Wordle, if a letter is repeated in guess and secret has it once, only one may be marked. But rules here don't specify, but assume standard: feedback marks each letter only as it corresponds to positions.

For example, secret BRISK, guess S T O R M: S(-) because S is in word but wrong position, etc, no indication on duplicates handling.

But to play safe, avoid repeats if possible.

So, ""WHITE"" seems good.

Another word: ""TICKE"" - not a word.

""TIMED"" not ends with E.

Perhaps ""THREE"": T,H,R,E,E – R absent and E repeated.

Out.

""TWINE"": T,W,I,N,E – N absent.

""PRICE"": P,R,I,C,E – R and C absent.

So, ""WHITE"" is one of our best bets.

Use ""KIITE"" - not a word.

Another common word: ""BITE"" - only 4 letters.

""UNITE"": U,N,I,T,E – N absent.

But we haven't tried U and I.

""QUITE"": Q,U,I,T,E – Q is rare, but U and I are common vowels. But Q might be wasted if not present.

However, Q and U are tested, but Q is infrequent.

Perhaps ""WHITE"" or ""EVITE"", but ""EVITE"" is obscure.

Another word: ""PETITE"" - too long.

5 letters: HYPHE - not common.

Better to go with ""WHITE"".

Or ""THIEF"" doesn't end in E.

""MINED"" ends in D, not E.

Let's think differently. Since E is at end, and T must be in 1,3, or 4, consider words with T at different positions.

Position 1: T _ _ _ E
Position 4: _ _ _ T E
Position 3: _ _ T _ E

Also, must include new letters.

With T at position 4: words ending with ""TE"", like ""WRITE"", but R absent. ""LITE"" too short. ""SITE"" S absent. ""MITE"" M,I,T,E – but only 4 letters if not specified? ""SMITE"" has S absent.

""ELITE"": E,L,I,T,E – L absent and E repeated.

""QUOTE"": O absent.

So few options.

With T at position 3: _ _ T _ E
Like ""CUTE"" too short. ""EXUTE"" not a word. ""PATTY"" no E. ""BITTY"" no E.
Possible words: ""MITRE"" M,I,T,R,E – R absent.
""FITRE"" not word.
""TITER"" has R.

Not good.

With T at position 1: T _ _ _ E
Examples: ""TABLE"" A absent.
""TIMED"" ends with D.
""TRACE"" R and C absent.
""TRIBE"" R absent.
""TIDES"" S and D? S absent.
""TIGER"" R absent.

""THYME"" as before: T,H,Y,M,E
""THYME"" is a word, letters: T,H,Y,M,E. No forbidden letters. H, Y, M are new.
But Y is less common.

""THYME"" is a valid English word.

Another: ""TIFFE"" not common.

""WHITE"" is T _ _ _ E but with T at 4? ""WHITE"" is W,H,I,T,E so position 4 is T.

In ""WHITE"", T is at position 4, which is new position to test.

Similarly, ""UNTIE"" but has N absent.

So, among the options, ""WHITE"" and ""THYME"" are candidates.

I think ""WHITE"" is better because it has I, a common vowel, whereas ""THYME"" has Y which is less common.

So, let's go with ""WHITE"".

Guessing ""WHITE"":
- W at position 1: new
- H at position 2: new
- I at position 3: new
- T at position 4: we know T is in the word, testing if at position 4
- E at position 5: confirmed already

So it tests W, H, I, and T at position 4.

If T is at position 4, it will show correct or misplaced.

Also, if any of W, H, I are in the word, we get feedback.

But there are other positions for T: position 1 or 3 are also possible.

But for now, ""WHITE"" seems reasonable.

To cover position 1, we could use a word with T at 1, like ""TIMED"" but doesn't end with E.

What about ""TWIRE"" not a word.

""THEME"": T,H,E,M,E – E repeated and E at position 3? T at 1, H at 2, E at 3, M at 4, E at 5. E at position 3 and 5. But we know E is at 5, so E at position 3 would be additional? Possible. Letters: T,H,E,M,E – so E and M. But we test E at 3, which may be present or not.

But feedback from second guess must be considered: E is only at position 5, so if we put E elsewhere, it might be marked as absent if not in the secret except at 5.

In ""THEME"", for position 1: T, position 2: H, position 3: E, position 4: M, position 5: E.

We know position 3 could be E or not? Secret might have E only at 5 or at other positions too.

But from available information, not necessarily duplicate E.

In ""THEME"", if secret has only one E at position 5, then the E at position 3 might be absent or marked wrong position? Since E is in the word but position is wrong.

But let's see feedback rules: if letter in word wrong position: marked as ""-""

If letter not in word: marked ""x""

If letter is in word and correct position: ""✓""

For ""THEME"", at position 5: E is known to be correct, so it would be ""✓"" 
At position 3: E could be ""-"" if secret has E at 5 but not at 3, and no other E? Secret has only one E? Or two? We don't know.

If secret has only one E at position 5, then E at position 3 should be marked ""x"" because it's not in the word elsewhere? Actually, feedback would mark E at 3 as not present if no other E positions.

Standard Wordle rule for duplicate letters: the feedback indicates presence based on oCcurrences. For example, if secret has one E and guess has two E's, one in wrong position and one correct, the correct position gets ""✓"", the other E may be marked as not present if not in other positions? Or if one is correct, the additional is not present if secret has only one.

Yes, typically: the correct position is prioritized, then for remaining, indicate presence for wrong position.

But the rules here don't specify, but we should assume standard Wordle behavior.

To avoid confusion, it might be better to use a word without repeating letters.

Therefore, ""WHITE"" is better: all different letters.

So, I choose ""WHITE"".**Step-by-step reasoning:**

- From **Guess 1: CRANE → FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)**  
  - **E is in the secret word and correctly positioned at the end (5th letter)**.  
  - **C, R, A, N are absent from the secret word**.  
  - Therefore, the secret word ends with E and does not contain C, R, A, or N.  

- From **Guess 2: STOLE → FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) O(x) L(x) E(✓)**  
  - **E(✓) is reconfirmed at position 5** (no change).  
  - **T(-) means T is in the secret word but not in position 2**.  
  - **S, O, L are absent** (added to the list of forbidden letters).  
  - Since T is present but misplaced in position 2, it must be in position 1, 3, or 4 of the secret word.  
  - Absent letters now are: **C, R, A, N, S, O, L**.  

**Summary of known information:**  
- The secret word has the format: `_ _ _ _ E`.  
- T is present but incorrectly positioned at 2, so it must be at position 1, 3, or 4.  
- Letters confirmed absent: **C, R, A, N, S, O, L**.  
- Available common letters to test (not yet tried): **B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, Y**, etc.  
- E at position 5 is fixed and known; do not need to retest it unnecessarily.  

**Strategy for next guess:**  
- Choose a word ending with **E** to leverage the known correct position.  
- Include **T** in a position not yet tested (position 1, 3, or 4—avoiding position 2).  
- Prioritize testing new high-frequency letters to maximize information gain: e.g., **I** (vowel) and **H**, **M**, **P** (common consonants).  
- Ensure the word contains no absent letters (C, R, A, N, S, O, L).  
- Avoid repeating letters to increase information efficiency (no duplicates).  

**Candidate word: WHITE**  
- **W** (new consonant) at position 1.  
- **H** (new consonant) at position 2 (testing if T was misplaced here; H could be present).  
- **I** (new vowel) at position 3 (valuable to test vowels).  
- **T** (known present) at position 4 (testing if T is correctly placed here).  
- **E** at position 5 (fixed, known correct).  
- **Fits all criteria**: Ends with E; includes T in an untested position (4); avoids forbidden letters; tests new common letters (W, H, I).  

This guess will provide feedback on the presence/position of T at position 4 and introduce three new letters, helping narrow down possibilities significantly.

Since it\'s the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. \nA good starting word often has common letters and a variety of distinct letters to get more feedback.\n\nSome popular starting words in Wordle are words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRAIN"", ""ROAST"", etc., because they contain common vowels and consonants.\n\nI\'ll choose a word that has three common vowels and two common consonants to cover a lot of ground.\n\nLet me choose: ""CRANE""\n\nIt has \'C\', \'R\', \'A\', \'N\', \'E\' – a good mix of vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N). \n\nSo, my first guess is ""CRANE"".I need to make the first guess in the Wordle game. Since I have no prior information, I\'ll choose a word that maximizes the potential information gain. A good starting word typically:\n- Uses common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants\n- Has no repeating letters\n- Covers a diverse set of frequent English letters (e.g., R, S, T, N, L)\n\nOne word that fits these criteria and is often recommended in Wordle strategies is ""CRANE"". It contains:\n- Two vowels (A and E)\n- Common consonants (C, R, N)\n- Five distinct letters\n\nThis will help me get feedback on commonly used letters and their positions efficiently.\n\n<guess>CRANE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"": \nC(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\n\nThis means:\n- E is in the secret word and is in the correct position (at the end, since E is the 5th letter).\n- C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.\n\nSo, we know:\n- The secret word ends with E (5th letter is E).\n- The letters C, R, A, N are absent.\n\nTherefore, the secret word is of the form: _ _ _ _ E\n\nWe must avoid using C, R, A, N in our next guess.\n\nNow, we need to choose a new 5-letter word that:\n- Ends with E (to confirm or get more information about the position of E, but we already know it\'s at the end, so we can use E at the end to test other letters).\n- Does not contain C, R, A, N.\n- Uses other common letters to maximize information.\n\nSince E is fixed at the end, we can focus on the first four letters.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, B, etc.\n\nWe should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.\n\nA good candidate might be a word that has multiple common consonants and vowels that we haven\'t tested.\n\nLet\'s consider words ending with E and without C, R, A, N.\n\nSome options:\n- ""SLATE"": but S, L, T are new, but A is already known to be absent (from feedback: A(x)), so we cannot use A. Similarly, we cannot use C, R, A, N.\n\nSo, we must avoid A. Therefore, ""SLATE"" is invalid because it has A.\n\nAnother option: ""SPIKE"" - has S, P, I, K, and ends with E. But we don\'t know if P, I, K are in the word. Also, it avoids the forbidden letters.\n\nBut we might want to include more common vowels. We haven\'t tested O, U, I, etc.\n\nAnother common word: ""STOLE"" - ends with E, and has S, T, O, L. All new letters.\n\nBut we must check if it\'s valid: no C, R, A, N. Yes.\n\nAlternatively, ""SPIKE"" is also good.\n\nBut note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize information. ""STOLE"" covers S, T, O, L, and E (which we know). Similarly, ""SPIKE"" covers S, P, I, K, E.\n\nWhich one is better? Both are good, but ""STOLE"" has two vowels (O and E) and two common consonants (S, T, L). ""SPIKE"" has I (vowel) and P, K (less common than T and L?).\n\nIn terms of letter frequency in English, S and T are very common, then L, O. P and K are less common.\n\nSo, ""STOLE"" might be better because it uses more common letters.\n\nBut we must also consider that we are trying to find the word, and we know the last letter is E. So, we can try to get information about the first four positions.\n\nAnother candidate: ""SHINE"" - has S, H, I, N. But N is forbidden (we had N(x) in the first feedback). So, we cannot use N.\n\nSimilarly, ""SUITE"" - has S, U, I, T, E. No forbidden letters? Let\'s check: no C, R, A, N. So, that\'s valid.\n\n""SUITE"" has S, U, I, T, E. That\'s four new letters: S, U, I, T.\n\nBut we already know E is at the end, so we are testing the first four with S, U, I, T.\n\nAlternatively, ""STOLE"" has S, T, O, L, E.\n\nI think both are good. Let me choose ""STOLE"" because it has O which is a common vowel.\n\nBut note: we have not tested I and U, which are also common vowels. However, we can test them in subsequent guesses.\n\nSince we have limited tries, we should try to cover as many common letters as possible.\n\nAnother word: ""HOUSE"" - has H, O, U, S, E. But we already know E is at the end, so we are testing H, O, U, S. And it avoids C, R, A, N.\n\n""HOUSE"" is a valid word.\n\nBut ""STOLE"" and ""HOUSE"" both have four new letters. ""STOLE"" has S, T, O, L. ""HOUSE"" has H, O, U, S.\n\nS is common to both. T is more common than H and U? T is very common, H and U are less common.\n\nBut we need to test vowels: we haven\'t tested O, U, I. So, ""HOUSE"" tests two vowels (O and U) and one consonant (H) and S.\n\n""STOLE"" tests one vowel (O) and three consonants (S, T, L).\n\nSince we know the word has an E, and we don\'t know about other vowels, it might be good to test multiple vowels.\n\nBut the secret word might have only one vowel (E) and the rest consonants? But that\'s rare for 5-letter words. Typically, there are at least two vowels.\n\nIn our first guess, we had A and E, but A is absent. So, the secret word has E and at least one more vowel.\n\nTherefore, testing two vowels in one guess might be efficient.\n\nSo, ""HOUSE"" tests O and U, which are two vowels we haven\'t tried.\n\nAlternatively, ""SUITE"" tests U and I.\n\nI think ""SUITE"" is a good option because it has U and I (two vowels) and S and T (two very common consonants).\n\nSo, let me go with ""SUITE"".\n\nBut wait, ""SUITE"" is S-U-I-T-E. The positions: S at 1, U at 2, I at 3, T at 4, E at 5.\n\nWe know E is correct at position 5, so we are testing the first four.\n\nAnother candidate: ""POISE"" - P, O, I, S, E. But P and O are new, but we avoid forbidden letters. However, we might prefer more common letters.\n\nI think ""SUITE"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut let\'s check the frequency: S, T, I, U are all common.\n\nI\'ll go with ""SUITE"".\n\nAlternatively, to cover more common consonants, ""SLIME"" - but L, I, M, but we have S and E. But we don\'t know about M. However, we cannot use ""SLIME"" because it has M? But M is not forbidden. But we have to avoid C, R, A, N. ""SLIME"" has S, L, I, M, E. That\'s valid.\n\nBut ""SLIME"" has I and M, while ""SUITE"" has U, I, T. T is more common than M.\n\nSo, I think ""SUITE"" is better.\n\nBut note: we have E at the end, so we don\'t need to test E again? Actually, we can use E at the end to confirm, but we already know it\'s there, so it\'s fine.\n\nI\'ll choose ""SUITE"".\n\nBut let me see if there\'s a word that uses more of the most common letters. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... but we know A and N are out, so T, O, I, S are good.\n\nA word with T, O, I, S and E? But we have only five letters. ""TOISE"" is not a word. ""STOIC"" has C which is forbidden.\n\nSo, ""SUITE"" seems good.\n\nAnother word: ""STILE"" - S, T, I, L, E. That has L instead of U. L is a common consonant. But we are missing testing U. However, U is less common than I and O? But we need to test both eventually.\n\nBut with ""STILE"", we get S, T, I, L, E. That\'s four new letters: S, T, I, L.\n\nSimilarly, ""SUITE"" gives S, U, I, T, E.\n\nI think both are acceptable. I\'ll go with ""STILE"" because it avoids the less common U and tests L which is common.\n\nBut we have to decide.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has double letters? But that might not be efficient for information.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""STOLE"" as I initially thought because it has O (a common vowel) and S, T, L (common consonants).\n\nSo, let\'s choose ""STOLE"".\n\nBut ""STOLE"" has O, which is a vowel we haven\'t tested, and it\'s common.\n\nSo, my next guess: ""STOLE""\n\nBut let me confirm: S at 1, T at 2, O at 3, L at 4, E at 5.\n\nWe know E is correct at 5, so we are testing positions 1-4 with S, T, O, L.\n\nIf we get feedback, we can narrow down.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with that.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"" (C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)), we know:\n- The secret word ends with ""E"" (5th letter is E).\n- The letters C, R, A, and N are not in the secret word at all.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- The word must end with ""E"" to leverage the known correct position.\n- It should avoid the letters C, R, A, and N.\n- To maximize information gain, the guess should include new, common English letters (e.g., S, T, O, L, I) to test their presence and positions.\n\nA strong candidate is ""STOLE"":\n- Ends with ""E"", confirming the 5th position.\n- Uses new common letters: S, T, O, L (all untested and frequent in English).\n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N).\n\nThis guess will provide feedback on the first four positions and help narrow down possible letters for the secret word.\n\n<guess>STOLE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: STOLE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) O(x) L(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\n1. First guess ""CRANE"": \n   - C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)\n   - This tells us:\n     - E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).\n     - C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.\n\n2. Second guess ""STOLE"":\n   - S(x), T(-), O(x), L(x), E(✓)\n   - E(✓) confirms E is still correctly placed at the end.\n   - T(-) means T is in the word but not in the 2nd position.\n   - S(x), O(x), L(x) mean S, O, L are not in the word at all.\n\nSo now we know:\n- The secret word ends with E (position 5 is E).\n- T is in the word, but not in position 2.\n- Letters that are absent: C, R, A, N, S, O, L.\n\nWe also know from the first round that only E is present and correct.\n\nSince T is present but not in position 2, and the 5th position is E, we can deduce T must be in one of the first four positions but not position 2. However, positions 1, 3, or 4 are possible for T.\n\nThe word structure so far: _ _ _ _ E\n\nWe need to guess a new 5-letter word that:\n- Ends with E (to keep position 5 confirmed).\n- Does not contain the absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, O, L.\n- Must include T (since it\'s present) but not in position 2.\n- Tests new common letters to get more information.\n\nList of letters still unknown (not absent and not confirmed except E):\nFrom absent letters: We know these are out: C, R, A, N, S, O, L.\nFrom present letters: Only T and E are known to be in the word. And E is fixed at end.\n\nOther letters we haven\'t tested:\nCommon letters include: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nSince we have limited guesses, we should test frequently used letters.\n\nThe word must have T somewhere (positions 1, 3, or 4) and E at end.\n\nWe should avoid putting T in position 2 again since we know it\'s wrong there.\n\nPossible positions for T: 1, 3, or 4.\n\nWe need to choose a word that tests letters efficiently.\n\nSince T could be in multiple positions, we might try to place T in a different position and test other new letters.\n\nA good candidate word might be one that places T in position 1 or 3 or 4 and adds new common letters.\n\nLet me list some words that end in E and contain T, but not C,R,A,N,S,O,L.\n\nUsing common letters: I, U, M, P, D, etc.\n\nExamples:\n- ""TABLE"": but A is absent (from guess1), so A not allowed.\n- ""TIMES"": S is absent (from guess2), not allowed.\n- ""TUBE"": only 4 letters, not 5.\n- ""TRUCE"": has R and C, which are absent. Not valid.\n- ""THOSE"": O and S are absent? O is absent (from guess2), yes O(x), S(x). So not allowed.\n- ""PRIDE"": P,R,I,D,E – R is absent. Out.\n- So we need to avoid R, C, A, N, S, O, L.\n\nTry words with T and E, and three other new letters.\n\nOptions:\n- ""TITHE"": but has T twice? And H, I, E, but length: T,I,T,H,E – positions: T at 1 and 3? But we need 5 distinct? The game allows repeated letters? Actually, Wordle allows repeated letters, but in this case, secret word might have repeats? But feedback doesn\'t mark duplicates specially? Based on rules: if a letter is repeated, the feedback might handle it as per standard Wordle rules. But in the rules given, it\'s not specified, so we assume standard behavior.\n\nHowever, since we have no indication of duplicates so far, and to maximize information, we might prefer a word with all distinct letters.\n\nBut no restriction in rules, so possible.\n\nBut for now, let\'s try to avoid repeats.\n\n""TIMED"": M,E,D – but T,I,M,E,D – letters: T, I, M, E, D. E at end? We need the word to end with E.\n\n""TIMED"" ends with D? No, it is T,I,M,E,D – position 5 is D, not E. We need to end with E.\n\nSo words ending with E.\n\n""SUITE"": but S and U? S is absent, so no.\n\nWe need starting words.\n\nExamples of words: \n- ""PIECE"": has E twice? P,I,E,C,E – and C is absent. Out.\n- ""MILE"": not 5 letters.\n- ""THINE"": H,I,N,E – N is absent. Out.\n- ""WHITE"": W,H,I,T,E – letters: W,H,I,T,E. Ends with E. Avoids forbidden letters: C,R,A,N,S,O,L are not present? S,O,L are forbidden? S from guess2 is absent, O absent, L absent.\n\nSo ""WHITE"": W,H,I,T,E\n- Positions: W at 1, H at 2, I at 3, T at 4, E at 5.\n\nWe know T is in the word, so having it at position 4 is good. We can see if it\'s correct or misplaced.\n\nAlso tests W, H, I.\n\nCommon letters: W,H,I.\n\nAnother option: ""QUITE"": Q,U,I,T,E – same positions: Q,U,I,T,E.\n\nQ is less common, so might not be ideal.\n\n""EXIST"": has S and X? S is absent.\n\n""OFFER"": no E at end.\n\n""TOUCH"": no E.\n\nFocus on words ending in E.\n\nList: \n- ""THIEF"": T,H,I,E,F – but ends with F? T,H,I,E,F – position 5 is F, not E. We need the word to have E at position 5.\n\n""ABIDE"": has A, and B,I,D,E – but A is absent.\n\n""GLIDE"": has G,L,I,D,E – but L is absent (L(x) in guess2).\n\n""PRIME"": P,R,I,M,E – R is absent.\n\n""DWINE"": not common, D,W,I,N,E – N is absent.\n\nSo, ""WHITE"" seems possible.\n\n""PHONE"": has O and N? O absent, N absent.\n\n""SHIRE"": has S and R? Both absent.\n\nAnother word: ""WRITE"": W,R,I,T,E – R is absent, so invalid.\n\n""UNTIE"": U,N,T,I,E – N absent.\n\n""QUOTE"": O absent.\n\n""EVITE"": E at start, not end? E,V,I,T,E – has E at start and end, but position 5 is E, so that\'s fine. Letters: E,V,I,T,E. So E repeated.\n\nBut in feedback, for secret word BRISk in example, no issue with repeats? But let\'s assume it\'s valid.\n\n""EVITE"" might not be common; ""EVITE"" means to avoid? Less common.\n\n""THYME"": T,H,Y,M,E – ends with E. Letters: T,H,Y,M,E. Not common letters, but possible.\n\nBetter to use common vowels: I,U.\n\n""GUISE"": G,U,I,S,E – S absent.\n\n""BIOME"": B,I,O,M,E – O absent.\n\nSo, hard to find words with common letters avoiding the absents.\n\n""WHITE"" is acceptable: W,H,I,T,E.\n\nBut W and H are not very common, so might not yield much.\n\n""DIODE"": D,I,O,D,E – O absent and repeated D? Not good.\n\nAnother: ""FIGHT"": no E.\n\n""JUDGE"": no E.\n\n""FENCE"": F,E,N,C,E – N and C absent.\n\nPerhaps ""CHIME"": C and H? C absent.\n\nBack to ""EVITE"": E,V,I,T,E – but E at position 1 and 5. We know position 5 is E, so we don\'t need to test E again? But we can. Actually, using E at position 1 could give information if E is elsewhere? But we think E is only at end? Secret word might have multiple E\'s? Possible.\n\nSimilarly, T we know is present once, but might be more.\n\nBut to avoid complexity, perhaps assume no duplicates for now.\n\nBut let\'s calculate: the feedback for repeated letters. In Wordle, if a letter is repeated in guess and secret has it once, only one may be marked. But rules here don\'t specify, but assume standard: feedback marks each letter only as it corresponds to positions.\n\nFor example, secret BRISK, guess S T O R M: S(-) because S is in word but wrong position, etc, no indication on duplicates handling.\n\nBut to play safe, avoid repeats if possible.\n\nSo, ""WHITE"" seems good.\n\nAnother word: ""TICKE"" - not a word.\n\n""TIMED"" not ends with E.\n\nPerhaps ""THREE"": T,H,R,E,E – R absent and E repeated.\n\nOut.\n\n""TWINE"": T,W,I,N,E – N absent.\n\n""PRICE"": P,R,I,C,E – R and C absent.\n\nSo, ""WHITE"" is one of our best bets.\n\nUse ""KIITE"" - not a word.\n\nAnother common word: ""BITE"" - only 4 letters.\n\n""UNITE"": U,N,I,T,E – N absent.\n\nBut we haven\'t tried U and I.\n\n""QUITE"": Q,U,I,T,E – Q is rare, but U and I are common vowels. But Q might be wasted if not present.\n\nHowever, Q and U are tested, but Q is infrequent.\n\nPerhaps ""WHITE"" or ""EVITE"", but ""EVITE"" is obscure.\n\nAnother word: ""PETITE"" - too long.\n\n5 letters: HYPHE - not common.\n\nBetter to go with ""WHITE"".\n\nOr ""THIEF"" doesn\'t end in E.\n\n""MINED"" ends in D, not E.\n\nLet\'s think differently. Since E is at end, and T must be in 1,3, or 4, consider words with T at different positions.\n\nPosition 1: T _ _ _ E\nPosition 4: _ _ _ T E\nPosition 3: _ _ T _ E\n\nAlso, must include new letters.\n\nWith T at position 4: words ending with ""TE"", like ""WRITE"", but R absent. ""LITE"" too short. ""SITE"" S absent. ""MITE"" M,I,T,E – but only 4 letters if not specified? ""SMITE"" has S absent.\n\n""ELITE"": E,L,I,T,E – L absent and E repeated.\n\n""QUOTE"": O absent.\n\nSo few options.\n\nWith T at position 3: _ _ T _ E\nLike ""CUTE"" too short. ""EXUTE"" not a word. ""PATTY"" no E. ""BITTY"" no E.\nPossible words: ""MITRE"" M,I,T,R,E – R absent.\n""FITRE"" not word.\n""TITER"" has R.\n\nNot good.\n\nWith T at position 1: T _ _ _ E\nExamples: ""TABLE"" A absent.\n""TIMED"" ends with D.\n""TRACE"" R and C absent.\n""TRIBE"" R absent.\n""TIDES"" S and D? S absent.\n""TIGER"" R absent.\n\n""THYME"" as before: T,H,Y,M,E\n""THYME"" is a word, letters: T,H,Y,M,E. No forbidden letters. H, Y, M are new.\nBut Y is less common.\n\n""THYME"" is a valid English word.\n\nAnother: ""TIFFE"" not common.\n\n""WHITE"" is T _ _ _ E but with T at 4? ""WHITE"" is W,H,I,T,E so position 4 is T.\n\nIn ""WHITE"", T is at position 4, which is new position to test.\n\nSimilarly, ""UNTIE"" but has N absent.\n\nSo, among the options, ""WHITE"" and ""THYME"" are candidates.\n\nI think ""WHITE"" is better because it has I, a common vowel, whereas ""THYME"" has Y which is less common.\n\nSo, let\'s go with ""WHITE"".\n\nGuessing ""WHITE"":\n- W at position 1: new\n- H at position 2: new\n- I at position 3: new\n- T at position 4: we know T is in the word, testing if at position 4\n- E at position 5: confirmed already\n\nSo it tests W, H, I, and T at position 4.\n\nIf T is at position 4, it will show correct or misplaced.\n\nAlso, if any of W, H, I are in the word, we get feedback.\n\nBut there are other positions for T: position 1 or 3 are also possible.\n\nBut for now, ""WHITE"" seems reasonable.\n\nTo cover position 1, we could use a word with T at 1, like ""TIMED"" but doesn\'t end with E.\n\nWhat about ""TWIRE"" not a word.\n\n""THEME"": T,H,E,M,E – E repeated and E at position 3? T at 1, H at 2, E at 3, M at 4, E at 5. E at position 3 and 5. But we know E is at 5, so E at position 3 would be additional? Possible. Letters: T,H,E,M,E – so E and M. But we test E at 3, which may be present or not.\n\nBut feedback from second guess must be considered: E is only at position 5, so if we put E elsewhere, it might be marked as absent if not in the secret except at 5.\n\nIn ""THEME"", for position 1: T, position 2: H, position 3: E, position 4: M, position 5: E.\n\nWe know position 3 could be E or not? Secret might have E only at 5 or at other positions too.\n\nBut from available information, not necessarily duplicate E.\n\nIn ""THEME"", if secret has only one E at position 5, then the E at position 3 might be absent or marked wrong position? Since E is in the word but position is wrong.\n\nBut let\'s see feedback rules: if letter in word wrong position: marked as ""-""\n\nIf letter not in word: marked ""x""\n\nIf letter is in word and correct position: ""✓""\n\nFor ""THEME"", at position 5: E is known to be correct, so it would be ""✓"" \nAt position 3: E could be ""-"" if secret has E at 5 but not at 3, and no other E? Secret has only one E? Or two? We don\'t know.\n\nIf secret has only one E at position 5, then E at position 3 should be marked ""x"" because it\'s not in the word elsewhere? Actually, feedback would mark E at 3 as not present if no other E positions.\n\nStandard Wordle rule for duplicate letters: the feedback indicates presence based on oCcurrences. For example, if secret has one E and guess has two E\'s, one in wrong position and one correct, the correct position gets ""✓"", the other E may be marked as not present if not in other positions? Or if one is correct, the additional is not present if secret has only one.\n\nYes, typically: the correct position is prioritized, then for remaining, indicate presence for wrong position.\n\nBut the rules here don\'t specify, but we should assume standard Wordle behavior.\n\nTo avoid confusion, it might be better to use a word without repeating letters.\n\nTherefore, ""WHITE"" is better: all different letters.\n\nSo, I choose ""WHITE"".**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n- From **Guess 1: CRANE → FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)**  \n  - **E is in the secret word and correctly positioned at the end (5th letter)**.  \n  - **C, R, A, N are absent from the secret word**.  \n  - Therefore, the secret word ends with E and does not contain C, R, A, or N.  \n\n- From **Guess 2: STOLE → FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) O(x) L(x) E(✓)**  \n  - **E(✓) is reconfirmed at position 5** (no change).  \n  - **T(-) means T is in the secret word but not in position 2**.  \n  - **S, O, L are absent** (added to the list of forbidden letters).  \n  - Since T is present but misplaced in position 2, it must be in position 1, 3, or 4 of the secret word.  \n  - Absent letters now are: **C, R, A, N, S, O, L**.  \n\n**Summary of known information:**  \n- The secret word has the format: `_ _ _ _ E`.  \n- T is present but incorrectly positioned at 2, so it must be at position 1, 3, or 4.  \n- Letters confirmed absent: **C, R, A, N, S, O, L**.  \n- Available common letters to test (not yet tried): **B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, Y**, etc.  \n- E at position 5 is fixed and known; do not need to retest it unnecessarily.  \n\n**Strategy for next guess:**  \n- Choose a word ending with **E** to leverage the known correct position.  \n- Include **T** in a position not yet tested (position 1, 3, or 4—avoiding position 2).  \n- Prioritize testing new high-frequency letters to maximize information gain: e.g., **I** (vowel) and **H**, **M**, **P** (common consonants).  \n- Ensure the word contains no absent letters (C, R, A, N, S, O, L).  \n- Avoid repeating letters to increase information efficiency (no duplicates).  \n\n**Candidate word: WHITE**  \n- **W** (new consonant) at position 1.  \n- **H** (new consonant) at position 2 (testing if T was misplaced here; H could be present).  \n- **I** (new vowel) at position 3 (valuable to test vowels).  \n- **T** (known present) at position 4 (testing if T is correctly placed here).  \n- **E** at position 5 (fixed, known correct).  \n- **Fits all criteria**: Ends with E; includes T in an untested position (4); avoids forbidden letters; tests new common letters (W, H, I).  \n\nThis guess will provide feedback on the presence/position of T at position 4 and introduce three new letters, helping narrow down possibilities significantly.\n\n<guess>WHITE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: STOLE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) O(x) L(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: WHITE -> FEEDBACK: W(x) H(✓) I(x) T(-) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the following feedback from previous guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
- This means E is in the word and in the correct position (5th). C, R, A, N are not in the word.

Guess 2: STOLE -> S(x) T(-) O(x) L(x) E(✓)
- E is confirmed at position 5. T is in the word but not in position 2. S, O, L are not in the word.

Guess 3: WHITE -> W(x) H(✓) I(x) T(-) E(✓)
- H is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, since H was the second letter in WHITE). 
- E is confirmed again at position 5.
- T is in the word but not in position 4 (since T was at position 4 in WHITE and got T(-)).
- W and I are not in the word.

So, summarizing:
- Correct positions: 
  - Position 2: H (from WHITE feedback H(✓))
  - Position 5: E (from all three guesses)
- Present but misplaced: T is in the word, but not at position 2 (from STOLE) and not at position 4 (from WHITE). Therefore, T must be at position 1 or 3.
- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, O, L, W, I (from all feedbacks: C,R,A,N from guess1; S,O,L from guess2; W,I from guess3)

The word structure is:
Position 1: unknown, but could be T
Position 2: H (fixed)
Position 3: unknown, but could be T
Position 4: unknown
Position 5: E (fixed)

We know T is in the word and must be at position 1 or 3.

We need to avoid using the absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, O, L, W, I.

Available letters: We have not tested many letters. Common letters left: B, D, F, G, K, M, P, U, V, Y, and possibly others.

Since position 2 and 5 are fixed, we need to find a word of the form: _ H _ _ E

And T must be at position 1 or 3.

We can consider two cases: T at 1 or T at 3.

But we need to test which one it is.

We also need to fill position 4 and the other position (1 or 3) with new letters.

To maximize information, we should choose a word that tests T at one of the positions and introduces new common letters.

Let's list possible words that fit the pattern and avoid absent letters.

First, if T is at position 1: T H _ _ E
The word must have T at 1, H at 2, E at 5, and two other letters not in the absent list.

Position 4 must be filled with a letter that is not absent.

Similarly, position 3 must be filled.

Possible words: 
- THYME: T H Y M E
  - Y and M are new, not tested.
- THESE: but S is absent, so no.
- THOSE: O and S absent.
- THINE: N and I absent (I is absent from guess3).
- THUMB: ends with B, not E? T H U M B, no E at end.

THYME seems a candidate.

If T is at position 3: then the word is _ H T _ E
Position 1 is unknown, position 4 is unknown.

Examples:
- AHTEE: not a word.
- MHTEE: not a word.
- Words like LHTEE: no.
- Actual words: UHTEE? Not a word.
- Perhaps ""BHTEE"" no.

Common words: 
- AHEAD: but A absent and ends with D.
- INSTE: not a word.
- We need words ending with E.

""CHUTE"": but C absent and U, T, E. But C is absent, and position 2 is H? CHUTE is C H U T E, so position 1 is C (absent), position 2 is H, position 3 is U, position 4 is T, position 5 is E. But C is absent, so invalid.

""SHUTE"": S absent.

""PHOTO"": no E.

Perhaps ""WHITE"" we already tried, but T was at 4.

Another word: ""THEME"", but E at position 3? T H E M E, but position 3 is E, but we have position 5 E, and E might be repeated? But in feedback, we have E at 5 correct, but E at 3 might be marked if present or not. But we don't know if secret has two E's.

But in THEME, position 1 is T, position 2 H, position 3 E, position 4 M, position 5 E.

But we have absent letters? T is present, H is present, E is present, M is new. But we have to avoid I, which is not in THEME.

But THEME has E at position 3 and 5. We know position 5 E is correct. If secret has only one E, then position 3 E would be marked as absent? Or if secret has two E's, it might be marked as present but wrong position? But we don't know.

Moreover, from previous feedback, we have no indication of multiple E's, but it's possible.

But to avoid complexity, let's not use repeated letters if possible.

Back to the pattern.

We have two cases for T: position 1 or 3.

We need to test which one.

We can choose a word that has T at position 1 to test that case, and also test new letters.

For example, ""THYME"": T H Y M E

This has T at 1, H at 2, Y at 3, M at 4, E at 5.

If we guess this and T is actually at position 1, then we might get T(✓) or if not, then T must be at 3.

But if we guess ""THYME"" and T is at position 1, then position 1 would be correct, and we get information about Y and M.

If T is not at 1, then T at position 1 would be marked as absent? But we know T is in the word, so if T is not at 1, it must be at 3, and position 1 would be a new letter, which might be absent or present.

But in ""THYME"", if T is at position 3 in secret, then in guess, T at position 1 would be marked as absent (since it's not in the word at position 1, and T is present but at another position, but the feedback for position 1 would be x if the letter is not T, and T is elsewhere, so it would be marked as - for T? No.

Let's clarify feedback rules.

In Wordle, for a given position, if the letter is correct, it's ✓. If the letter is in the word but wrong position, it's -. If not in the word, it's x.

For ""THYME"" guess:

- Position 1: T. If secret has T at position 1, then ✓. If secret has T at position 3, then T at position 1 is not correct, but T is in the word, so it should be marked as - (wrong position). But the - is for the letter, not the position. So if T is in the word but not at position 1, it would be marked as - for position 1.

Similarly, if T is not in the word at all, it would be x, but we know T is in the word, so it must be - if not at position 1.

In this case, since we know T is in the word, if we put T at position 1 and it's not correct, it will be marked as -.

Similarly, if we put T at position 3, and it's correct, it would be ✓, or if not, - or x.

But in our case, for ""THYME"", we have T at position 1.

If secret has T at position 1: then T(✓) at position 1, and we get feedback on Y and M.

If secret has T at position 3: then T at position 1 would be marked as - (since T is in the word but wrong position), and then we know T is at position 3, and we get feedback on Y and M.

In either case, we will know where T is.

Also, we test Y and M.

Y is a vowel-like letter, M is a common consonant.

Another option: ""THUMB"" but doesn't end with E.

""THYME"" is a valid word.

We could test T at position 3 with a different word.

For example, ""MHTEE"" not a word.

""CHUTE"" invalid.

""PHONE"" O absent.

Perhaps ""SHADE"" S and A absent.

So ""THYME"" seems a good choice.

But we have position 4 to fill, and in ""THYME"" it's M.

Another word: ""THERE"" but E at position 3 and 5, and R absent.

Not good.

""THESE"" S absent.

""THINE"" N and I absent.

So ""THYME"" is acceptable.

But let's see if there is a word with more common letters.

""THUMB"" no E.

""THEFT"" F and T, but ends with T, not E.

""THREW"" R absent and ends with W.

Not.

So, I think ""THYME"" is a reasonable guess.

But we have to consider that position 4 might be a letter we can test.

Since we have limited guesses, we need to make progress.

Another idea: since T is at 1 or 3, and we have to fill position 4, we can choose a word that has a common letter at position 4 and T at one of the positions.

But ""THYME"" does that.

Perhaps ""CHIME"" C absent.

I think we should go with ""THYME"".

But let's confirm the feedback from guess3: WHITE had H at position 2 correct, so position 2 is H.

In ""THYME"", position 2 is H, so it should be correct.

Similarly, position 5 E correct.

So, guess: THYME

If we get feedback, we can determine T's position.

Also, we test Y and M.

If Y or M are in the word, we get feedback.

If not, they are absent.

So, I think it's a good guess.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses, here's a step-by-step analysis to inform the next guess:

### Key Information from Feedback:
1. **Guess 1: CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)**  
   - **E** is in the secret word and correctly positioned at **position 5**.  
   - **C, R, A, N** are absent from the secret word.  

2. **Guess 2: STOLE → S(x) T(-) O(x) L(x) E(✓)**  
   - **E** is reconfirmed at **position 5**.  
   - **T** is in the secret word but **not at position 2**.  
   - **S, O, L** are absent.  

3. **Guess 3: WHITE → W(x) H(✓) I(x) T(-) E(✓)**  
   - **H** is in the secret word and correctly positioned at **position 2**.  
   - **E** is reconfirmed at **position 5**.  
   - **T** is in the secret word but **not at position 4** (since it was guessed at position 4 and marked as ""-"").  
   - **W and I** are absent.  

### Deductions:
- **Fixed positions**:  
  - Position 2: **H** (from WHITE feedback).  
  - Position 5: **E** (consistent across all guesses).  
- **T's position**: T is present but misplaced in both Guess 2 (position 2) and Guess 3 (position 4). Therefore, T must be at **position 1 or 3** (the only remaining positions).  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, S, O, L, W, I (cannot be used).  
- **Word structure**: The secret word is of the form `_ H _ _ E`, with T at position 1 or 3.  
- **Available letters**: Focus on untested common letters like B, D, F, G, K, M, P, U, V, Y.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Test T's position**: Since T must be at position 1 or 3, the next guess should place T at one of these positions to resolve the ambiguity. Position 1 is chosen for this guess to directly test if T is the starting letter.  
- **Maximize information gain**: Include new high-frequency letters (e.g., M, Y) to test their presence and positions.  
- **Avoid absent letters**: Ensure no C, R, A, N, S, O, L, W, I are used.  
- **Word selection**: ""THYME"" fits all criteria:  
  - Starts with T (testing position 1).  
  - H at position 2 (known correct, so it will reconfirm).  
  - Y at position 3 (new vowel-like letter).  
  - M at position 4 (new common consonant).  
  - E at position 5 (known correct).  
  - No absent letters and all letters distinct.  

If T is at position 1, this guess may confirm it. If not, T must be at position 3 (and feedback will show T as ""-"" at position 1). Feedback on Y and M will also help narrow possibilities for positions 3 and 4.

<guess>THYME</guess>",THYME,"We have the following feedback from previous guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
- This means E is in the word and in the correct position (5th). C, R, A, N are not in the word.

Guess 2: STOLE -> S(x) T(-) O(x) L(x) E(✓)
- E is confirmed at position 5. T is in the word but not in position 2. S, O, L are not in the word.

Guess 3: WHITE -> W(x) H(✓) I(x) T(-) E(✓)
- H is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, since H was the second letter in WHITE). 
- E is confirmed again at position 5.
- T is in the word but not in position 4 (since T was at position 4 in WHITE and got T(-)).
- W and I are not in the word.

So, summarizing:
- Correct positions: 
  - Position 2: H (from WHITE feedback H(✓))
  - Position 5: E (from all three guesses)
- Present but misplaced: T is in the word, but not at position 2 (from STOLE) and not at position 4 (from WHITE). Therefore, T must be at position 1 or 3.
- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, O, L, W, I (from all feedbacks: C,R,A,N from guess1; S,O,L from guess2; W,I from guess3)

The word structure is:
Position 1: unknown, but could be T
Position 2: H (fixed)
Position 3: unknown, but could be T
Position 4: unknown
Position 5: E (fixed)

We know T is in the word and must be at position 1 or 3.

We need to avoid using the absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, O, L, W, I.

Available letters: We have not tested many letters. Common letters left: B, D, F, G, K, M, P, U, V, Y, and possibly others.

Since position 2 and 5 are fixed, we need to find a word of the form: _ H _ _ E

And T must be at position 1 or 3.

We can consider two cases: T at 1 or T at 3.

But we need to test which one it is.

We also need to fill position 4 and the other position (1 or 3) with new letters.

To maximize information, we should choose a word that tests T at one of the positions and introduces new common letters.

Let's list possible words that fit the pattern and avoid absent letters.

First, if T is at position 1: T H _ _ E
The word must have T at 1, H at 2, E at 5, and two other letters not in the absent list.

Position 4 must be filled with a letter that is not absent.

Similarly, position 3 must be filled.

Possible words: 
- THYME: T H Y M E
  - Y and M are new, not tested.
- THESE: but S is absent, so no.
- THOSE: O and S absent.
- THINE: N and I absent (I is absent from guess3).
- THUMB: ends with B, not E? T H U M B, no E at end.

THYME seems a candidate.

If T is at position 3: then the word is _ H T _ E
Position 1 is unknown, position 4 is unknown.

Examples:
- AHTEE: not a word.
- MHTEE: not a word.
- Words like LHTEE: no.
- Actual words: UHTEE? Not a word.
- Perhaps ""BHTEE"" no.

Common words: 
- AHEAD: but A absent and ends with D.
- INSTE: not a word.
- We need words ending with E.

""CHUTE"": but C absent and U, T, E. But C is absent, and position 2 is H? CHUTE is C H U T E, so position 1 is C (absent), position 2 is H, position 3 is U, position 4 is T, position 5 is E. But C is absent, so invalid.

""SHUTE"": S absent.

""PHOTO"": no E.

Perhaps ""WHITE"" we already tried, but T was at 4.

Another word: ""THEME"", but E at position 3? T H E M E, but position 3 is E, but we have position 5 E, and E might be repeated? But in feedback, we have E at 5 correct, but E at 3 might be marked if present or not. But we don't know if secret has two E's.

But in THEME, position 1 is T, position 2 H, position 3 E, position 4 M, position 5 E.

But we have absent letters? T is present, H is present, E is present, M is new. But we have to avoid I, which is not in THEME.

But THEME has E at position 3 and 5. We know position 5 E is correct. If secret has only one E, then position 3 E would be marked as absent? Or if secret has two E's, it might be marked as present but wrong position? But we don't know.

Moreover, from previous feedback, we have no indication of multiple E's, but it's possible.

But to avoid complexity, let's not use repeated letters if possible.

Back to the pattern.

We have two cases for T: position 1 or 3.

We need to test which one.

We can choose a word that has T at position 1 to test that case, and also test new letters.

For example, ""THYME"": T H Y M E

This has T at 1, H at 2, Y at 3, M at 4, E at 5.

If we guess this and T is actually at position 1, then we might get T(✓) or if not, then T must be at 3.

But if we guess ""THYME"" and T is at position 1, then position 1 would be correct, and we get information about Y and M.

If T is not at 1, then T at position 1 would be marked as absent? But we know T is in the word, so if T is not at 1, it must be at 3, and position 1 would be a new letter, which might be absent or present.

But in ""THYME"", if T is at position 3 in secret, then in guess, T at position 1 would be marked as absent (since it's not in the word at position 1, and T is present but at another position, but the feedback for position 1 would be x if the letter is not T, and T is elsewhere, so it would be marked as - for T? No.

Let's clarify feedback rules.

In Wordle, for a given position, if the letter is correct, it's ✓. If the letter is in the word but wrong position, it's -. If not in the word, it's x.

For ""THYME"" guess:

- Position 1: T. If secret has T at position 1, then ✓. If secret has T at position 3, then T at position 1 is not correct, but T is in the word, so it should be marked as - (wrong position). But the - is for the letter, not the position. So if T is in the word but not at position 1, it would be marked as - for position 1.

Similarly, if T is not in the word at all, it would be x, but we know T is in the word, so it must be - if not at position 1.

In this case, since we know T is in the word, if we put T at position 1 and it's not correct, it will be marked as -.

Similarly, if we put T at position 3, and it's correct, it would be ✓, or if not, - or x.

But in our case, for ""THYME"", we have T at position 1.

If secret has T at position 1: then T(✓) at position 1, and we get feedback on Y and M.

If secret has T at position 3: then T at position 1 would be marked as - (since T is in the word but wrong position), and then we know T is at position 3, and we get feedback on Y and M.

In either case, we will know where T is.

Also, we test Y and M.

Y is a vowel-like letter, M is a common consonant.

Another option: ""THUMB"" but doesn't end with E.

""THYME"" is a valid word.

We could test T at position 3 with a different word.

For example, ""MHTEE"" not a word.

""CHUTE"" invalid.

""PHONE"" O absent.

Perhaps ""SHADE"" S and A absent.

So ""THYME"" seems a good choice.

But we have position 4 to fill, and in ""THYME"" it's M.

Another word: ""THERE"" but E at position 3 and 5, and R absent.

Not good.

""THESE"" S absent.

""THINE"" N and I absent.

So ""THYME"" is acceptable.

But let's see if there is a word with more common letters.

""THUMB"" no E.

""THEFT"" F and T, but ends with T, not E.

""THREW"" R absent and ends with W.

Not.

So, I think ""THYME"" is a reasonable guess.

But we have to consider that position 4 might be a letter we can test.

Since we have limited guesses, we need to make progress.

Another idea: since T is at 1 or 3, and we have to fill position 4, we can choose a word that has a common letter at position 4 and T at one of the positions.

But ""THYME"" does that.

Perhaps ""CHIME"" C absent.

I think we should go with ""THYME"".

But let's confirm the feedback from guess3: WHITE had H at position 2 correct, so position 2 is H.

In ""THYME"", position 2 is H, so it should be correct.

Similarly, position 5 E correct.

So, guess: THYME

If we get feedback, we can determine T's position.

Also, we test Y and M.

If Y or M are in the word, we get feedback.

If not, they are absent.

So, I think it's a good guess.Based on the feedback from previous guesses, here's a step-by-step analysis to inform the next guess:

### Key Information from Feedback:
1. **Guess 1: CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)**  
   - **E** is in the secret word and correctly positioned at **position 5**.  
   - **C, R, A, N** are absent from the secret word.  

2. **Guess 2: STOLE → S(x) T(-) O(x) L(x) E(✓)**  
   - **E** is reconfirmed at **position 5**.  
   - **T** is in the secret word but **not at position 2**.  
   - **S, O, L** are absent.  

3. **Guess 3: WHITE → W(x) H(✓) I(x) T(-) E(✓)**  
   - **H** is in the secret word and correctly positioned at **position 2**.  
   - **E** is reconfirmed at **position 5**.  
   - **T** is in the secret word but **not at position 4** (since it was guessed at position 4 and marked as ""-"").  
   - **W and I** are absent.  

### Deductions:
- **Fixed positions**:  
  - Position 2: **H** (from WHITE feedback).  
  - Position 5: **E** (consistent across all guesses).  
- **T's position**: T is present but misplaced in both Guess 2 (position 2) and Guess 3 (position 4). Therefore, T must be at **position 1 or 3** (the only remaining positions).  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, S, O, L, W, I (cannot be used).  
- **Word structure**: The secret word is of the form `_ H _ _ E`, with T at position 1 or 3.  
- **Available letters**: Focus on untested common letters like B, D, F, G, K, M, P, U, V, Y.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Test T's position**: Since T must be at position 1 or 3, the next guess should place T at one of these positions to resolve the ambiguity. Position 1 is chosen for this guess to directly test if T is the starting letter.  
- **Maximize information gain**: Include new high-frequency letters (e.g., M, Y) to test their presence and positions.

  - Y at position 3 (new vowel-like letter).  
  - M at position 4 (new common consonant).  
  - E at position 5 (known correct).  
  - No absent letters and all letters distinct.  

If T is at position 1, this guess may confirm it. If not, T must be at position 3 (and feedback will show T as ""-"" at position 1). Feedback on Y and M will also help narrow possibilities for positions 3 and 4.",Guess 4: THYME -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) H(✓) Y(✓) M(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
