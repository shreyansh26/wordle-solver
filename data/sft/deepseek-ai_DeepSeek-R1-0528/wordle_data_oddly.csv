We are starting the game. Since it's the first guess, I don't have any prior information.
 I should choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained.

 Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N).
 A popular starting word is ""SLATE"" because it contains common letters and two vowels.

 However, note that the feedback symbols:
   ✓: correct letter and position
   -: letter in word but wrong position
   x: letter not in word

 Let me choose ""RAISE"" because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). 
 Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is another good candidate but might be less common.

 But let's go with ""RAISE"".

We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""raise"" had all letters incorrect: R, A, I, S, E are not in the word.
2. ""mount"" had: M(x), O(-), U(x), N(x), T(x). This means:
   - O is in the word but in the wrong position.
   - M, U, N, T are not in the word.

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter O, but not in the second position (since ""mount"" had O in the second position and got ""-"" meaning present but misplaced).
- The word does not contain: R, A, I, S, E, M, U, N, T.

Now, we need to guess a new word that:
- Includes O (but not in the second position).
- Uses other common letters not yet eliminated.

Eliminated letters: R, A, I, S, E, M, U, N, T.

Available common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We know O must be in the word, so we can try a word with O placed in a different position: 1st, 3rd, 4th, or 5th.

We also want to test other common consonants.

Possible positions for O: let's avoid position 2 (since in ""mount"" it was at position 2 and was wrong). We can try position 1,  for example.

A word like ""lobby"" - but has double B? Also, we are limited to 5 distinct letters? Not necessarily, but for maximum information, we might prefer distinct letters.

Let's list common letters not eliminated: L, C, D, G, H, K, P, B, etc.

Some word ideas:
- ""POLKA"": has P, O, L, K, A - but A is eliminated (from first guess). Cannot use A.
- ""COULD"": has C, O, U, L, D - but U is eliminated (from second guess, U is x). 
- Must avoid eliminated letters: U is out.

Words without eliminated letters: no R, A, I, S, E, M, U, N, T.

So, for O, let's try position 1: Words starting with O? But O is present and we know it's not in position 2, but it could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Another idea: ""CLOAK"" - but has A (eliminated) and K.

Cannot use A. 

Word: ""COLOR"" - but has double O and R (eliminated). Not allowed.

Word: ""FLOOD"" - has F, L, O, O, D. Valid word? Double O. But we can use repeated letters, but ideally we want as many new letters as possible.

Let's try ""GLOBE"": G, L, O, B, E - but E is eliminated (from first guess). 

E is eliminated.

Avoid E.

Word: ""BLOOD"" - has B, L, O, O, D. Double O.

Or ""BLOC"": too short? Must be 5 letters.

Five-letter words: 

- ""BLOCK"": B, L, O, C, K - letters: B, L, O, C, K. None eliminated? Check: B not eliminated, L not, O is in the word but position might change, C not, K not.

But O is at position 3? We know O is in the word so we can try ""BLOCK"" to test B, L, C, K and confirm O? However, we already know O is present, so we don't need to confirm O per se, but we need to find its position.

We need to place O in a position that is not position 2.

In ""BLOCK"", O is in position 3.

So that could be a candidate.

Other options:

- ""PROOF"": has P, R, O, O, F - R is eliminated (x from first guess). So cannot use R.

Similarly, avoid eliminated letters.

Another: ""WHOOP"": W, H, O, O, P - has double O, but W, H, P not tested.

We don't know frequency of W and H, but we can try.

But let's go with ""BLOCK"": letters B, L, O, C, K.

Benefits:
- Avoids all eliminated letters: R,A,I,S,E,M,U,N,T.
- Uses common new consonants: B, L, C, K.
- Places O in position 3, which is different from previous.

We hope to get feedback on these letters.

Alternatively, ""POOCH"" or ""CHOMP"" - but CHOMP has M, which is eliminated? M is eliminated (from ""mount"" feedback, M is x). So no.

Must not use eliminated letters.

So ""BLOCK"" is a valid option.

Another candidate: ""FLOCK"" - F, L, O, C, K. F is new.

But ""BLOCK"" and ""FLOCK"" are similar.

Another: ""COULD"" is invalid because of U (eliminated).

""GLOVE"" has E and G? GLOVE: G, L, O, V, E. E is eliminated and V is new? Eliminated letters: E is out.

So E not allowed.

""BOXED"" has E and X? BOXED: B, O, X, E, D. E is out.

Not good.

""JOKED"" has J and E: E is out.

So perhaps ""BLOCK"" is good.

We might also consider other positions for O.

Perhaps O is in position 1? Word like ""OTHER"": but O, T, H, E, R. T and E and R are eliminated.

Cannot.

""OLIVE"": has O, L, I, V, E. I and E are eliminated.

So difficult.

Another word: ""CHOMP"" - but M is eliminated? Yes, from second guess.

""CHOPS"": C, H, O, P, S. S is eliminated? From first guess, S is x. So S is out.

Therefore, ""BLOCK"" seems solid: B, L, O, C, K.

We can use ""BLOCK"".

But let's confirm: positions:
- B at 1
- L at 2
- O at 3
- C at 4
- K at 5

We know O cannot be at position 2? Actually, no: in ""mount"", O was at position 2 and got ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not at that position. So O could be at any position except 2? Or maybe it could be at position 2? 

No: the feedback for O was ""-"", which means it is in the word but not in position 2. So we must avoid position 2 for O. In ""BLOCK"", O is at position 3, which is fine.

So ""BLOCK"" is acceptable.

We could try O at position 4 or 5.

For example, ""PLODS"": P, L, O, D, S - S eliminated.

Not good.

""VODKA"": V, O, D, K, A - A eliminated.

Not.

So ""BLOCK"" is a reasonable choice.

We are trying to maximize new letters: with ""BLOCK"", we test B, L, C, K (and O we know is present).

Good.

Based on the feedback:
- **Guess 1: raise → R(x), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(x)**: So R, A, I, S, E are **not** in the secret word.
- **Guess 2: mount → M(x), O(-), U(x), N(x), T(x)**: 
  - O is in the word but **not in position 2**.
  - M, U, N, T are **not** in the word.

**Key insights**:
- The secret word contains **O**, but it cannot be in position 2.
- Eliminated letters: R, A, I, S, E, M, U, N, T (total 10 excluded).
- Remaining letters to prioritize: Common consonants like B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, V, W, Y, etc.

**Strategy for next guess**:
- Must include **O**, but avoid position 2. Testing O in position 3 (to explore a new position).
- Avoid eliminated letters: Focus on letters like B, L, C, K (common and untested).
- **BLOCK** is a strong candidate:
  - 4 new letters: B, L, C, K—all high-frequency consonants.
  - Places O in position 3 (avoiding the forbidden position 2).
  - Valid English word.
- Benefits: Maximizes coverage of new letters while confirming O's position.

<guess>block</guess>",block,"We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""raise"" had all letters incorrect: R, A, I, S, E are not in the word.
2. ""mount"" had: M(x), O(-), U(x), N(x), T(x). This means:
   - O is in the word but in the wrong position.
   - M, U, N, T are not in the word.

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter O, but not in the second position (since ""mount"" had O in the second position and got ""-"" meaning present but misplaced).
- The word does not contain: R, A, I, S, E, M, U, N, T.

Now, we need to guess a new word that:
- Includes O (but not in the second position).
- Uses other common letters not yet eliminated.

Eliminated letters: R, A, I, S, E, M, U, N, T.

Available common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We know O must be in the word, so we can try a word with O placed in a different position: 1st, 3rd, 4th, or 5th.

We also want to test other common consonants.

Possible positions for O: let's avoid position 2 (since in ""mount"" it was at position 2 and was wrong). We can try position 1,  for example.

A word like ""lobby"" - but has double B? Also, we are limited to 5 distinct letters? Not necessarily, but for maximum information, we might prefer distinct letters.

Let's list common letters not eliminated: L, C, D, G, H, K, P, B, etc.

Some word ideas:
- ""POLKA"": has P, O, L, K, A - but A is eliminated (from first guess). Cannot use A.
- ""COULD"": has C, O, U, L, D - but U is eliminated (from second guess, U is x). 
- Must avoid eliminated letters: U is out.

Words without eliminated letters: no R, A, I, S, E, M, U, N, T.

So, for O, let's try position 1: Words starting with O? But O is present and we know it's not in position 2, but it could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Another idea: ""CLOAK"" - but has A (eliminated) and K.

Cannot use A. 

Word: ""COLOR"" - but has double O and R (eliminated). Not allowed.

Word: ""FLOOD"" - has F, L, O, O, D. Valid word? Double O. But we can use repeated letters, but ideally we want as many new letters as possible.

Let's try ""GLOBE"": G, L, O, B, E - but E is eliminated (from first guess). 

E is eliminated.

Avoid E.

Word: ""BLOOD"" - has B, L, O, O, D. Double O.

Or ""BLOC"": too short? Must be 5 letters.

Five-letter words: 

- ""BLOCK"": B, L, O, C, K - letters: B, L, O, C, K. None eliminated? Check: B not eliminated, L not, O is in the word but position might change, C not, K not.

But O is at position 3? We know O is in the word so we can try ""BLOCK"" to test B, L, C, K and confirm O? However, we already know O is present, so we don't need to confirm O per se, but we need to find its position.

We need to place O in a position that is not position 2.

In ""BLOCK"", O is in position 3.

So that could be a candidate.

Other options:

- ""PROOF"": has P, R, O, O, F - R is eliminated (x from first guess). So cannot use R.

Similarly, avoid eliminated letters.

Another: ""WHOOP"": W, H, O, O, P - has double O, but W, H, P not tested.

We don't know frequency of W and H, but we can try.

But let's go with ""BLOCK"": letters B, L, O, C, K.

Benefits:
- Avoids all eliminated letters: R,A,I,S,E,M,U,N,T.
- Uses common new consonants: B, L, C, K.
- Places O in position 3, which is different from previous.

We hope to get feedback on these letters.

Alternatively, ""POOCH"" or ""CHOMP"" - but CHOMP has M, which is eliminated? M is eliminated (from ""mount"" feedback, M is x). So no.

Must not use eliminated letters.

So ""BLOCK"" is a valid option.

Another candidate: ""FLOCK"" - F, L, O, C, K. F is new.

But ""BLOCK"" and ""FLOCK"" are similar.

Another: ""COULD"" is invalid because of U (eliminated).

""GLOVE"" has E and G? GLOVE: G, L, O, V, E. E is eliminated and V is new? Eliminated letters: E is out.

So E not allowed.

""BOXED"" has E and X? BOXED: B, O, X, E, D. E is out.

Not good.

""JOKED"" has J and E: E is out.

So perhaps ""BLOCK"" is good.

We might also consider other positions for O.

Perhaps O is in position 1? Word like ""OTHER"": but O, T, H, E, R. T and E and R are eliminated.

Cannot.

""OLIVE"": has O, L, I, V, E. I and E are eliminated.

So difficult.

Another word: ""CHOMP"" - but M is eliminated? Yes, from second guess.

""CHOPS"": C, H, O, P, S. S is eliminated? From first guess, S is x. So S is out.

Therefore, ""BLOCK"" seems solid: B, L, O, C, K.

We can use ""BLOCK"".

But let's confirm: positions:
- B at 1
- L at 2
- O at 3
- C at 4
- K at 5

We know O cannot be at position 2? Actually, no: in ""mount"", O was at position 2 and got ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not at that position. So O could be at any position except 2? Or maybe it could be at position 2? 

No: the feedback for O was ""-"", which means it is in the word but not in position 2. So we must avoid position 2 for O. In ""BLOCK"", O is at position 3, which is fine.

So ""BLOCK"" is acceptable.

We could try O at position 4 or 5.

For example, ""PLODS"": P, L, O, D, S - S eliminated.

Not good.

""VODKA"": V, O, D, K, A - A eliminated.

Not.

So ""BLOCK"" is a reasonable choice.

We are trying to maximize new letters: with ""BLOCK"", we test B, L, C, K (and O we know is present).

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,oddly,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. Since it's the first guess, I don't have any prior information.
 I should choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained.

 Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N).
 A popular starting word is ""SLATE"" because it contains common letters and two vowels.

 However, note that the feedback symbols:
   ✓: correct letter and position
   -: letter in word but wrong position
   x: letter not in word

 Let me choose ""RAISE"" because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). 
 Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is another good candidate but might be less common.

 But let's go with ""RAISE"".

 Format: <guess> raise </guess>I am starting the Wordle game with no prior information. For the first guess, I want to maximize the information gained by using a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""RAISE"" is a strong opener because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which covers frequent letters in English 5-letter words. This will help reveal positional hints and presence/absence of letters efficiently.

<guess>raise</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We received feedback for the first guess ""raise"": R(x), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(x)
 This means none of the letters R, A, I, S, E are in the secret word.

 Since we have eliminated these common letters, we need to pick a new word that avoids these letters and uses other common letters.

 Remaining common letters include: T, N, O, U, L, C, D, M, P, H, G, B, K, etc.

 We should aim to cover as many new common letters as possible in one guess.

 Let me think of a word that uses five of the most common remaining letters without using R, A, I, S, E.

 Common remaining letters: T, N, O, L, C, D, U, M, P, H, G, B, K.

 Some good options:
  - ""CLOUT"": uses C, L, O, U, T
  - ""MOUNT"": uses M, O, U, N, T
  - ""POUND"": uses P, O, U, N, D

 Considering frequency:
  T, N, O, L are very common.

 I'll go with ""MOUNT"": letters M, O, U, N, T.

 This word covers four vowels (O, U) and one consonant (M, N, T) but O and U are vowels. Actually, N and T are consonants. 

 It's a valid word and avoids the previously eliminated letters.

 Alternatively, ""TOUCH"" uses T, O, U, C, H but that's 5 distinct letters.

 Another option: ""BOUND"" - B, O, U, N, D.

 However, ""MOUNT"" seems fine.

 Let's choose ""mount"".Based on the feedback from the first guess:
- All letters in ""raise"" (R, A, I, S, E) are **absent** in the secret word (all marked ""x"").

I need a new guess that:
1. Completely excludes R, A, I, S, E.
2. Uses new common English letters to maximize information (e.g., consonants like T, N, L, C, and vowels like O, U).

Strong candidate words:
- **TONYC**: Combines high-frequency letters (T, O, N) but ""C"" less common.
- **MOUNT**: Uses M, O, U, N, T—covers four new vowels/consonants.
- **YOUNG**: Includes Y, O, U, N, G—good vowel coverage.

Best choice: **MOUNT**
- Tests M, O, U, N, T.
- Avoids all previously eliminated letters (R, A, I, S, E).

But let's go with ""BLOCK"": letters B, L, O, C, K.

Benefits:
- Avoids all eliminated letters: R,A,I,S,E,M,U,N,T.
- Uses common new consonants: B, L, C, K.

We hope to get feedback on these letters.

M is eliminated (from ""mount"" feedback, M is x). So no.\n\nMust not use eliminated letters.\n\nSo ""BLOCK"" is a valid option.\n\nAnother candidate: ""FLOCK"" - F, L, O, C, K. F is new.\n\nBut ""BLOCK"" and ""FLOCK"" are similar.\n\nAnother: ""COULD"" is invalid because of U (eliminated).\n\n""GLOVE"" has E and G? GLOVE: G, L, O, V, E. E is eliminated and V is new?

I and E are eliminated.\n\nSo difficult.\n\nAnother word: ""CHOMP"" - but M is eliminated? Yes, from second guess.\n\n""CHOPS"": C, H, O, P, S. S is eliminated? From first guess, S is x. So S is out.\n\nTherefore, ""BLOCK"" seems solid: B, L, O, C, K.\n\nWe can use ""BLOCK"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm: positions:\n- B at 1\n- L at 2\n- O at 3\n- C at 4\n- K at 5\n\nWe know O cannot be at position 2? Actually, no: in ""mount"", O was at position 2 and got ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not at that position. So O could be at any position except 2? Or maybe it could be at position 2? \n\nNo: the feedback for O was ""-"", which means it is in the word but not in position 2. So we must avoid position 2 for O. In ""BLOCK"", O is at position 3, which is fine.\n\nSo ""BLOCK"" is acceptable.\n\nWe could try O at position 4 or 5.\n\nFor example, ""PLODS"": P, L, O, D, S - S eliminated.\n\nNot good.\n\n""VODKA"": V, O, D, K, A - A eliminated.\n\nNot.\n\nSo ""BLOCK"" is a reasonable choice.\n\nWe are trying to maximize new letters: with ""BLOCK"", we test B, L, C, K (and O we know is present).\n\nGood.Based on the feedback:\n- **Guess 1: raise → R(x), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(x)**: So R, A, I, S, E are **not** in the secret word.\n- **Guess 2: mount → M(x), O(-), U(x), N(x), T(x)**: \n  - O is in the word but **not in position 2**.\n  - M, U, N, T are **not** in the word.\n\n**Key insights**:\n- The secret word contains **O**, but it cannot be in position 2.\n- Eliminated letters: R, A, I, S, E, M, U, N, T (total 10 excluded).\n- Remaining letters to prioritize: Common consonants like B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, V, W, Y, etc.\n\n**Strategy for next guess**:\n- Must include **O**, but avoid position 2.

We have feedback from three guesses:
1. ""raise"": R, A, I, S, E → all absent.
2. ""mount"": M, O, U, N, T → only O is present but in wrong position (position 2). Others absent.
3. ""block"": B, L, O, C, K → 
   - B: absent (x)
   - L: present but wrong position (-) — since L was in position 2 and it's present.
   - O: present but wrong position (-) — O was in position 3, so O is in the word but not at 2 or 3? We had from guess2 that O is not at position 2, now also not at position 3.
   - C: absent (x)
   - K: absent (x)

So, known information:
- Letters in the word: O and L. But O was already known from guess2, now we also know L is present.
- Letters absent: R, A, I, S, E, M, U, N, T, B, C, K (from the three guesses).
- Positions:
  - O cannot be in position 2 (from guess2) or position 3 (from guess3).
  - L cannot be in position 2 (because guess3 has L in position2 and got a dash, meaning it is in the word but not there).

Therefore, the secret word contains O and L, but not at positions 2 (for O) or 2 (for L). The positions that O and L can be are 1, 4, or 5.

Also, since L is present and we haven't tested it before, and O we know is present.

We have two letters confirmed: L and O.

Now, the word must have three more letters, none of which are from the eliminated set: R, A, I, S, E, M, U, N, T, B, C, K.

Eliminated letters: 12 letters so far.

Remaining available letters: D, F, G, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, we need to form a 5-letter word with L and O and three other letters from the above available set. Also, the positions of L and O must be considered.

Constraints on positions:
- O: cannot be at position 2 or 3 → so O must be at 1, 4, or 5.
- L: cannot be at position 2 (from guess3) → so L must be at 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note that the word has five positions, and L can be in 1,3,4,5. However, we don't have constraints on other positions.

We don't know if L can be at position 1 or not? We haven't tested L at position 1. Similarly for O.

Possible placements:

We need to guess a word that has L and O in allowed positions and uses new letters.

Common letters among the available: D, F, G, H, P, Q, V, W, Y.

Let's try to list words that include L, O and three of these letters.

Possible positions:
- Let's assume O at position 1? Then the word starts with O.
  - But known: O is in the word but not at 2 or 3. Position 1 possible.
- Or O at position 4.
- Or O at position 5.

Similarly for L: can be at 1, 3, 4, 5.

Given that we have two known letters, we can construct words. Also, we might get more information by testing new letters.

We'll focus on words that have distinct new letters to maximize information.

Aim for a word that:
- Contains L and O (both must be placed in positions that are not forbidden for each).
- Uses three new letters from {D, F, G, H, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z}.

Possible words:

Option: O at position 1. Then word starts with O. Example words:
- ""OILED"": but I and E are eliminated → invalid.
- ""OLDEN"": O, L, D, E, N → E and N are eliminated → invalid.
- ""OLIVE"": O, L, I, V, E → I and E eliminated → invalid.

We must avoid eliminated letters.

So words starting with O: 
- ""OAKUM"": but A and U are eliminated → invalid.

Another: ""OPERA"": O, P, E, R, A → E, R, A eliminated → no.

Need a word starting with O that doesn't use eliminated letters and has L? Not that L might be elsewhere.

Wait: consider words with O and L and no eliminated letters.

Available letters: D, F, G, H, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Example words:
- ""GLOOP"": G, L, O, O, P → double O? Not sure if allowed. But the word must be valid. ""gloop"" is informal but might be allowed.

We can also consider O at position 4:
- e.g., ___, L, ?, O, ? 

But L must not be at 2? So we can have L in positions 1,3,4,5.

Or O at position 5: ...O.

Perhaps ""VODKA"": but V, O, D, K, A — K and A eliminated → no.

""DOILY"": D, O, I, L, Y → I eliminated.

Another: ""POLYP"": P, O, L, Y, P? Has double P? Valid medical term? P,O,L,Y,P — and Y is available? Yes. But word: ""polyp"" is 5-letter? But letters: P,O,L,Y,P. So two P's? We have to accept repeated letters if necessary.

But ideally, to test more letters, distinct is better.

Another word: ""FOGLE"": F, O, G, L, E → E eliminated → not.

""LOUGH"": L, O, U, G, H → U eliminated? Yes, from guess2.

Not.

""PLOUGH"": too long? 6 letters.

5-letter words that include L and O and three from {D,F,G,H,P,Q,V,W,Y}:

How about ""LOWLY"" — L, O, W, L, Y → has double L? And W, Y. But Y is available.

But we might waste letters? Not efficient.

Another: ""HOLLY"" — H, O, L, L, Y → double L? But not distinct letters.

To maximize information, we should prefer distinct letters. So pick words with 5 distinct letters as possible.

But we have to include L and O, so we'll only test three new ones? Actually, in any word we test now, at minimum we have L and O, plus three others.

But repeated letters are acceptable if the word requires them? The rules don't forbid it, but to get more information, distinct letters are better.

We haven't tested D, F, G, H, P, Q, V, W, etc.

So attempt:

Word: ""GOLPH"" — is that a word? Not standard. There might be few options.

Another: ""FOLLY"" — F,O,L,L,Y → doubles L? But L is already known, so that doesn't help much? We know L is in the word, but if we duplicate it and one gets ✓ or -, that might tell us about count? But Wordle doesn't indicate count? Wait, the game does not indicate if there are multiple letters? Actually, let me recall: each letter is checked independently. But the feedback doesn't explicitly show duplicates.

For example, if we guess two L's and the word has one L, then one L gets correct status, and the other might be absent? Actually, the rules: each letter is given a symbol independently? So if the word has one L and we guess two L's, and one of them is in the exact spot, that one gets ✓ and the other might get x? Or? 

Example: secret word: WHALE. Guess: SHELL -> S: -, H: ✓, E: ✓, L: -, L: x? Because the second L is not in the word? So the feedback marks duplicates appropriately.

So in our case, if we have a word with two L's, we might get two - or? It's permissible, but for maximizing new letters, distinct is better.

But let's try to find a word with L, O and three distinct new letters from available.

Possible: ""LOVHY"" — not a word.

""POLKA"" — P, O, L, K, A? K and A eliminated.

""DOGLY"" — not standard.

There are fewer options. Let's list common words:

- ""DOLLY"": D, O, L, L, Y → double L? But D and Y are new. And O and L known. So we test D and Y? But L repeated.
- ""HOPED"": H, O, P, E, D → E eliminated → invalid.
- ""WOULD"": W, O, U, L, D → U eliminated → invalid.
- ""FLOCK"": but in guess3 we used BLOCK? FLOCK has F? F,L,O,C,K. C and K are eliminated? From guess3, C and K are absent? So cannot use F,C,K? Wait: eliminated letters include C and K.

Eliminated letters: R, A, I, S, E, M, U, N, T, B, C, K. So C and K out.

We can use F? We didn't use F.

Another word: ""FOXED"": F, O, X, E, D → E eliminated → not.
""DOZED"": D, O, Z, E, D → E out.
""LOGIC"": L, O, G, I, C → I and C eliminated.

It's challenging.

Perhaps L and O together at the end? Or beginning.

Alternative: O at position 4? Or L at position 3?

Consider ""WOLDY"" — not common.

Another: ""HOWFF"" — unfamiliar.

We can try ""PLOY"" — too short.

Five-letter word: ""OPING"" — not a word; it's ""oping"" missing the letter.

Perhaps ""OCCUR"" — O,C,C,U,R — eliminated letters C, U, R -> out.

We need to consult word list.

Common choices: 
- ""POOH"" — 4 letters? No.

How about ""HYPOD"" — hypodermic? Not standard.

But acceptable words? We can use ""LOWED"" but E eliminated.

Perhaps I missed some available letters: available are D, F, G, H, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Word: ""HOWDY"" — H, O, W, D, Y → no L? But we must have L in the word! Requirement: the word must contain L.

So we cannot avoid L.

So the word must have L as well.

So let's look for words with L, O in them and three other available letters.

Another idea: ""GLORY"" → G, L, O, R, Y. But R is eliminated → invalid.

""POLAR"": P, O, L, A, R → A and R eliminated → no.

""VOLEY"": V, O, L, E, Y → E eliminated.

Not.

""DAMP"" — too short.

Perhaps ""FOWL"": but 4 letters? 

We need to use a word with L and an possible O? But O is required.

Another: ""YOWL"": 4 letters.

5-letter: ""YOUTH""→ no L.

""PILOT""→ P, I, L, O, T → I eliminated, T eliminated → invalid.

""HELIO"" → H, E, L, I, O → E and I eliminated.

""BIFFO"" → B, I, F, F, O → B and I eliminated → no.

This is hard. We might have to use a word that has repeated letters or uncommon letters.

But let's try ""FJOLD""→ not a common word.

I found: ""GLOOP""→ informally a sticky substance? Acceptable? Or ""GLOPY""? Similar issue.

""PLOID"": ploid is not common? Not valid.

Acceptable: ""OLOGY"" → O, L, O, G, Y → double O? And no third new letter? Using G and Y? But O repeated? We know O and L? Then we would test G and Y.

But O at position 1 and 3? In ""OLOGY"", O at 1 and 3. But since we have two O's, the feedback might be: if the word has one O, the O at position 1 might be ✓ or - and position 3 might be x? Not sure.

We can try ""PODGY"" → P, O, D, G, Y → no L? Without L. We cannot submit a word without L because L is confirmed present.

We know L must be in the word, so we need it.

So how about ""DOLLY"" — D, O, L, L, Y.

In ""DOLLY"", we have L at position 3 and 4? We can place L in position 3 or 4? But position 2 is disallowed for L? In this word, L is at 3 and 4.

The feedback: for L in position 3 and position 4, one could be correct if the secret word has L at one of these positions? With duplicates, not sure.

We might lose information? But D and Y are new.

Alternatively, ""GOLLY"": G, O, L, L, Y → similar to ""DOLLY"".

Or ""POLYP"": P, O, L, Y, P → double P? With L and O.

But ""polyp"" is a valid word.

We can use that: P, O, L, Y, P.

O at position 2? But O cannot be at position 2? We have to avoid O at position 2. In ""POLYP"", O is at position 2? Letters: P (1), O (2), L (3), Y (4), P (5)? O is at position 2? We cannot have O at position 2!

The feedback from guess2: O was at position 2 and got -, meaning it cannot be at position 2. So we cannot place O at position 2 again. In ""OLYP"", O is at position 2? So the spelling of ""polyp"" is: 1: P, 2: O, 3: L, 4: Y, 5: P.

So O at position 2 — not allowed! We must avoid position 2 for O.

So ""polyp"" is invalid because O is at position 2.

Similarly, ""DOLLY"" has O at position 2? ""DOLLY"": D(1), O(2), L(3), L(4), Y(5) — O at 2, not allowed.

We must place O only at positions 1, 4, or 5.

Similarly for L: we will avoid position 2.

So words without O at 2 and without L at 2 are required.

For example, O at position 1: words starting with O.

Word with O at 1 and L in it? Possible placements: L at 3,4,5? Since position 2 might be occupied by a different letter.

Examples:

- ""OXLIP"": O, X, L, I, P → I eliminated; also, L at position 3.
- But I is out.

""OFLET"" — not common.

""OODLE"": O, O, D, L, E → double O, and E eliminated → invalid.

""OPAHS"": O, P, A, H, S → A, S eliminated → invalid.

O at position 4: the fourth letter is O.

For example, ""- - - O -""

We need to include L at one of positions 1,3,4,5 but not 4 if there is O? Word at position 4 is O, so L can be elsewhere.

For example, ""FLODO"" not standard.

""BLOOD"": B eliminated → no.

""GWY O"" not.

O at position 5: last letter O.

Word ending with O: e.g., ""- - - - O""

And include L at positions 1, 3, or 4 (since position 5 is O, so L cannot be there).

For example, ""HELLO"": H, E, L, L, O → E eliminated → no.

""JELLO"": J, E, L, L, O → E eliminated → no.

""CELLO"": C, E, L, L, O → C, E eliminated → no.

""VOLVO"": V, O, L, V, O → has O twice at positions 2 and 5? Position 2: O? Not allowed? O at position 2: not allowed! So cannot.

""GYPPO"": G, Y, P, P, O → no L.

""RADIO"": R, A, D, I, O → all eliminated except D? But R,A,I eliminated → invalid.

""CALLO"": C, A, L, L, O → C and A eliminated → no.

""DADO"": too short.

5-letters: ""GUIRO"": G, U, I, R, O → U, I, R eliminated → no.

""WOOSH"": W, O, O, S, H → O at position 2? Not allowed, and S eliminated → no.

""PYGMY"": P, Y, G, M, Y → M eliminated; no L or O.

This is tough. Let's consider O at position 4 and L at position 5? For example, a word: ? ? ? O L ?

Position 5 would be L? Words ending with OL? Like ""CAROL"": C, A, R, O, L → eliminated.

Or ""VIDEO"": V, I, D, E, O → E, I eliminated.

""MODEM"": M, O, D, E, M → M and E eliminated.

 Not working.

Perhaps O at position 1 and L at position 4?

Example: ""O F L something""? For example, ""OFLIP"" not valid.

""ODDLY"": O, D, D, L, Y → letters: O, D, L, Y — and double D? So D is repeated? Position: O(1), D(2), D(3), L(4), Y(5).

Now, O is at position 1 — permitted; L is at position 4 — permitted? We have to avoid L at position 2? Here L is at position 4, so OK.

And eliminated letters: we have D, L, Y — D and Y are new? Is D eliminated? No, because we only eliminated R,A,I,S,E,M,U,N,T,B,C,K. So D is available.

Similarly, Y is available.

But the word has a double D? Yes, ""oddly"" is a valid word.

Benefits: 
- Tests O at position 1.
- Tests L at position 4.
- Tests new letters: D and Y (for first time).
- Avoids eliminated letters? No eliminated letters in this word? O is known, D and Y are new, L is known? So we will get feedback on D and Y.

But D appears twice? Feedback for each D.

This might work.

Another option is ""LOVAT"" or something? Not common.

""OVULE"" -> U, E eliminated.

""ODDLY"" seems acceptable.

If not, ""OILY "" — but I and space.

So let's go with ""ODDLY"": O, D, D, L, Y.

But previously we tried to avoid double letters? But ""ODDLY"" is a common word.

Letters: O at 1, D at 2, D at 3, L at 4, Y at 5.

Feedback will show:
- If O at 1 is correct? or if not.
- D at 2 and D at 3 — the secret word may or may not have D.

We will get information about D and Y.

Since we are stuck with options, we'll choose this.

Another possibility: ""GOOLD"" — not common.

So finally, we guess ""ODDLY"".

After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

1. **Absent Letters**: R, A, I, S, E, M, U, N, T, B, C, K (all ✘ from previous guesses).
2. **Present Letters**:
   - **O**: Confirmed in the word but *not* at position 2 (from ""mount"") or position 3 (from ""block"").
   - **L**: Confirmed in the word but *not* at position 2 (from ""block"").
3. **Valid Positions**:
   - O must be at positions 1, 4, or 5.
   - L must be at positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (excluding position 2).
4. **Remaining Letters**: Available consonants/vowels to test: D, F, G, H, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

**Constraints for the New Guess**:
- Must include both **O** and **L**.
- Avoid positions forbidden for O (2, 3) and L (2).
- Use only untested letters (no R, A, I, S, E, M, U, N, T, B, C, K) to maximize new information.

**Strategically Selected Word: ""ODDLY""**
- **L and O Placement**: O at position 1 (new test position), L at position 4 (allowed position).
- **Tested New Letters**: D (positions 2 and 3 - testing if present/correct frequency) and Y (position 5).
- **Word Validation**: ""ODDLY"" is a valid English word (adverb meaning unusually or remarkably).
- **Risk**: Double D may reduce information gain vs. distinct letters, but available word options are limited. This tests D/Y and positions of O/L efficiently.

If ""ODDLY"" feedback confirms D/Y presence, it will narrow down the remaining possibilities significantly.

<guess>oddly</guess>",oddly,"We have feedback from three guesses:
1. ""raise"": R, A, I, S, E → all absent.
2. ""mount"": M, O, U, N, T → only O is present but in wrong position (position 2). Others absent.
3. ""block"": B, L, O, C, K → 
   - B: absent (x)
   - L: present but wrong position (-) — since L was in position 2 and it's present.
   - O: present but wrong position (-) — O was in position 3, so O is in the word but not at 2 or 3? We had from guess2 that O is not at position 2, now also not at position 3.
   - C: absent (x)
   - K: absent (x)

So, known information:
- Letters in the word: O and L. But O was already known from guess2, now we also know L is present.
- Letters absent: R, A, I, S, E, M, U, N, T, B, C, K (from the three guesses).
- Positions:
  - O cannot be in position 2 (from guess2) or position 3 (from guess3).
  - L cannot be in position 2 (because guess3 has L in position2 and got a dash, meaning it is in the word but not there).

Therefore, the secret word contains O and L, but not at positions 2 (for O) or 2 (for L). The positions that O and L can be are 1, 4, or 5.

Also, since L is present and we haven't tested it before, and O we know is present.

We have two letters confirmed: L and O.

Now, the word must have three more letters, none of which are from the eliminated set: R, A, I, S, E, M, U, N, T, B, C, K.

Eliminated letters: 12 letters so far.

Remaining available letters: D, F, G, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, we need to form a 5-letter word with L and O and three other letters from the above available set. Also, the positions of L and O must be considered.

Constraints on positions:
- O: cannot be at position 2 or 3 → so O must be at 1, 4, or 5.
- L: cannot be at position 2 (from guess3) → so L must be at 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note that the word has five positions, and L can be in 1,3,4,5. However, we don't have constraints on other positions.

We don't know if L can be at position 1 or not? We haven't tested L at position 1. Similarly for O.

Possible placements:

We need to guess a word that has L and O in allowed positions and uses new letters.

Common letters among the available: D, F, G, H, P, Q, V, W, Y.

Let's try to list words that include L, O and three of these letters.

Possible positions:
- Let's assume O at position 1? Then the word starts with O.
  - But known: O is in the word but not at 2 or 3. Position 1 possible.
- Or O at position 4.
- Or O at position 5.

Similarly for L: can be at 1, 3, 4, 5.

Given that we have two known letters, we can construct words. Also, we might get more information by testing new letters.

We'll focus on words that have distinct new letters to maximize information.

Aim for a word that:
- Contains L and O (both must be placed in positions that are not forbidden for each).
- Uses three new letters from {D, F, G, H, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z}.

Possible words:

Option: O at position 1. Then word starts with O. Example words:
- ""OILED"": but I and E are eliminated → invalid.
- ""OLDEN"": O, L, D, E, N → E and N are eliminated → invalid.
- ""OLIVE"": O, L, I, V, E → I and E eliminated → invalid.

We must avoid eliminated letters.

So words starting with O: 
- ""OAKUM"": but A and U are eliminated → invalid.

Another: ""OPERA"": O, P, E, R, A → E, R, A eliminated → no.

Need a word starting with O that doesn't use eliminated letters and has L? Not that L might be elsewhere.

Wait: consider words with O and L and no eliminated letters.

Available letters: D, F, G, H, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Example words:
- ""GLOOP"": G, L, O, O, P → double O? Not sure if allowed. But the word must be valid. ""gloop"" is informal but might be allowed.

We can also consider O at position 4:
- e.g., ___, L, ?, O, ? 

But L must not be at 2? So we can have L in positions 1,3,4,5.

Or O at position 5: ...O.

Perhaps ""VODKA"": but V, O, D, K, A — K and A eliminated → no.

""DOILY"": D, O, I, L, Y → I eliminated.

Another: ""POLYP"": P, O, L, Y, P? Has double P? Valid medical term? P,O,L,Y,P — and Y is available? Yes. But word: ""polyp"" is 5-letter? But letters: P,O,L,Y,P. So two P's? We have to accept repeated letters if necessary.

But ideally, to test more letters, distinct is better.

Another word: ""FOGLE"": F, O, G, L, E → E eliminated → not.

""LOUGH"": L, O, U, G, H → U eliminated? Yes, from guess2.

Not.

""PLOUGH"": too long? 6 letters.

5-letter words that include L and O and three from {D,F,G,H,P,Q,V,W,Y}:

How about ""LOWLY"" — L, O, W, L, Y → has double L? And W, Y. But Y is available.

But we might waste letters? Not efficient.

Another: ""HOLLY"" — H, O, L, L, Y → double L? But not distinct letters.

To maximize information, we should prefer distinct letters. So pick words with 5 distinct letters as possible.

But we have to include L and O, so we'll only test three new ones? Actually, in any word we test now, at minimum we have L and O, plus three others.

But repeated letters are acceptable if the word requires them? The rules don't forbid it, but to get more information, distinct letters are better.

We haven't tested D, F, G, H, P, Q, V, W, etc.

So attempt:

Word: ""GOLPH"" — is that a word? Not standard. There might be few options.

Another: ""FOLLY"" — F,O,L,L,Y → doubles L? But L is already known, so that doesn't help much? We know L is in the word, but if we duplicate it and one gets ✓ or -, that might tell us about count? But Wordle doesn't indicate count? Wait, the game does not indicate if there are multiple letters? Actually, let me recall: each letter is checked independently. But the feedback doesn't explicitly show duplicates.

For example, if we guess two L's and the word has one L, then one L gets correct status, and the other might be absent? Actually, the rules: each letter is given a symbol independently? So if the word has one L and we guess two L's, and one of them is in the exact spot, that one gets ✓ and the other might get x? Or? 

Example: secret word: WHALE. Guess: SHELL -> S: -, H: ✓, E: ✓, L: -, L: x? Because the second L is not in the word? So the feedback marks duplicates appropriately.

So in our case, if we have a word with two L's, we might get two - or? It's permissible, but for maximizing new letters, distinct is better.

But let's try to find a word with L, O and three distinct new letters from available.

Possible: ""LOVHY"" — not a word.

""POLKA"" — P, O, L, K, A? K and A eliminated.

""DOGLY"" — not standard.

There are fewer options. Let's list common words:

- ""DOLLY"": D, O, L, L, Y → double L? But D and Y are new. And O and L known. So we test D and Y? But L repeated.
- ""HOPED"": H, O, P, E, D → E eliminated → invalid.
- ""WOULD"": W, O, U, L, D → U eliminated → invalid.
- ""FLOCK"": but in guess3 we used BLOCK? FLOCK has F? F,L,O,C,K. C and K are eliminated? From guess3, C and K are absent? So cannot use F,C,K? Wait: eliminated letters include C and K.

Eliminated letters: R, A, I, S, E, M, U, N, T, B, C, K. So C and K out.

We can use F? We didn't use F.

Another word: ""FOXED"": F, O, X, E, D → E eliminated → not.
""DOZED"": D, O, Z, E, D → E out.
""LOGIC"": L, O, G, I, C → I and C eliminated.

It's challenging.

Perhaps L and O together at the end? Or beginning.

Alternative: O at position 4? Or L at position 3?

Consider ""WOLDY"" — not common.

Another: ""HOWFF"" — unfamiliar.

We can try ""PLOY"" — too short.

Five-letter word: ""OPING"" — not a word; it's ""oping"" missing the letter.

Perhaps ""OCCUR"" — O,C,C,U,R — eliminated letters C, U, R -> out.

We need to consult word list.

Common choices: 
- ""POOH"" — 4 letters? No.

How about ""HYPOD"" — hypodermic? Not standard.

But acceptable words? We can use ""LOWED"" but E eliminated.

Perhaps I missed some available letters: available are D, F, G, H, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Word: ""HOWDY"" — H, O, W, D, Y → no L? But we must have L in the word! Requirement: the word must contain L.

So we cannot avoid L.

So the word must have L as well.

So let's look for words with L, O in them and three other available letters.

Another idea: ""GLORY"" → G, L, O, R, Y. But R is eliminated → invalid.

""POLAR"": P, O, L, A, R → A and R eliminated → no.

""VOLEY"": V, O, L, E, Y → E eliminated.

Not.

""DAMP"" — too short.

Perhaps ""FOWL"": but 4 letters? 

We need to use a word with L and an possible O? But O is required.

Another: ""YOWL"": 4 letters.

5-letter: ""YOUTH""→ no L.

""PILOT""→ P, I, L, O, T → I eliminated, T eliminated → invalid.

""HELIO"" → H, E, L, I, O → E and I eliminated.

""BIFFO"" → B, I, F, F, O → B and I eliminated → no.

This is hard. We might have to use a word that has repeated letters or uncommon letters.

But let's try ""FJOLD""→ not a common word.

I found: ""GLOOP""→ informally a sticky substance? Acceptable? Or ""GLOPY""? Similar issue.

""PLOID"": ploid is not common? Not valid.

Acceptable: ""OLOGY"" → O, L, O, G, Y → double O? And no third new letter? Using G and Y? But O repeated? We know O and L? Then we would test G and Y.

But O at position 1 and 3? In ""OLOGY"", O at 1 and 3. But since we have two O's, the feedback might be: if the word has one O, the O at position 1 might be ✓ or - and position 3 might be x? Not sure.

We can try ""PODGY"" → P, O, D, G, Y → no L? Without L. We cannot submit a word without L because L is confirmed present.

We know L must be in the word, so we need it.

So how about ""DOLLY"" — D, O, L, L, Y.

In ""DOLLY"", we have L at position 3 and 4? We can place L in position 3 or 4? But position 2 is disallowed for L? In this word, L is at 3 and 4.

The feedback: for L in position 3 and position 4, one could be correct if the secret word has L at one of these positions? With duplicates, not sure.

We might lose information? But D and Y are new.

Alternatively, ""GOLLY"": G, O, L, L, Y → similar to ""DOLLY"".

Or ""POLYP"": P, O, L, Y, P → double P? With L and O.

But ""polyp"" is a valid word.

We can use that: P, O, L, Y, P.

O at position 2? But O cannot be at position 2? We have to avoid O at position 2. In ""POLYP"", O is at position 2? Letters: P (1), O (2), L (3), Y (4), P (5)? O is at position 2? We cannot have O at position 2!

The feedback from guess2: O was at position 2 and got -, meaning it cannot be at position 2. So we cannot place O at position 2 again. In ""OLYP"", O is at position 2? So the spelling of ""polyp"" is: 1: P, 2: O, 3: L, 4: Y, 5: P.

So O at position 2 — not allowed! We must avoid position 2 for O.

So ""polyp"" is invalid because O is at position 2.

Similarly, ""DOLLY"" has O at position 2? ""DOLLY"": D(1), O(2), L(3), L(4), Y(5) — O at 2, not allowed.

We must place O only at positions 1, 4, or 5.

Similarly for L: we will avoid position 2.

So words without O at 2 and without L at 2 are required.

For example, O at position 1: words starting with O.

Word with O at 1 and L in it? Possible placements: L at 3,4,5? Since position 2 might be occupied by a different letter.

Examples:

- ""OXLIP"": O, X, L, I, P → I eliminated; also, L at position 3.
- But I is out.

""OFLET"" — not common.

""OODLE"": O, O, D, L, E → double O, and E eliminated → invalid.

""OPAHS"": O, P, A, H, S → A, S eliminated → invalid.

O at position 4: the fourth letter is O.

For example, ""- - - O -""

We need to include L at one of positions 1,3,4,5 but not 4 if there is O? Word at position 4 is O, so L can be elsewhere.

For example, ""FLODO"" not standard.

""BLOOD"": B eliminated → no.

""GWY O"" not.

O at position 5: last letter O.

Word ending with O: e.g., ""- - - - O""

And include L at positions 1, 3, or 4 (since position 5 is O, so L cannot be there).

For example, ""HELLO"": H, E, L, L, O → E eliminated → no.

""JELLO"": J, E, L, L, O → E eliminated → no.

""CELLO"": C, E, L, L, O → C, E eliminated → no.

""VOLVO"": V, O, L, V, O → has O twice at positions 2 and 5? Position 2: O? Not allowed? O at position 2: not allowed! So cannot.

""GYPPO"": G, Y, P, P, O → no L.

""RADIO"": R, A, D, I, O → all eliminated except D? But R,A,I eliminated → invalid.

""CALLO"": C, A, L, L, O → C and A eliminated → no.

""DADO"": too short.

5-letters: ""GUIRO"": G, U, I, R, O → U, I, R eliminated → no.

""WOOSH"": W, O, O, S, H → O at position 2? Not allowed, and S eliminated → no.

""PYGMY"": P, Y, G, M, Y → M eliminated; no L or O.

This is tough. Let's consider O at position 4 and L at position 5? For example, a word: ? ? ? O L ?

Position 5 would be L? Words ending with OL? Like ""CAROL"": C, A, R, O, L → eliminated.

Or ""VIDEO"": V, I, D, E, O → E, I eliminated.

""MODEM"": M, O, D, E, M → M and E eliminated.

 Not working.

Perhaps O at position 1 and L at position 4?

Example: ""O F L something""? For example, ""OFLIP"" not valid.

""ODDLY"": O, D, D, L, Y → letters: O, D, L, Y — and double D? So D is repeated? Position: O(1), D(2), D(3), L(4), Y(5).

Now, O is at position 1 — permitted; L is at position 4 — permitted? We have to avoid L at position 2? Here L is at position 4, so OK.

And eliminated letters: we have D, L, Y — D and Y are new? Is D eliminated? No, because we only eliminated R,A,I,S,E,M,U,N,T,B,C,K. So D is available.

Similarly, Y is available.

But the word has a double D? Yes, ""oddly"" is a valid word.

Benefits: 
- Tests O at position 1.
- Tests L at position 4.
- Tests new letters: D and Y (for first time).
- Avoids eliminated letters? No eliminated letters in this word? O is known, D and Y are new, L is known? So we will get feedback on D and Y.

But D appears twice? Feedback for each D.

This might work.

Another option is ""LOVAT"" or something? Not common.

""OVULE"" -> U, E eliminated.

""ODDLY"" seems acceptable.

If not, ""OILY "" — but I and space.

So let's go with ""ODDLY"": O, D, D, L, Y.

But previously we tried to avoid double letters? But ""ODDLY"" is a common word.

Letters: O at 1, D at 2, D at 3, L at 4, Y at 5.

Feedback will show:
- If O at 1 is correct? or if not.
- D at 2 and D at 3 — the secret word may or may not have D.

We will get information about D and Y.

Since we are stuck with options, we'll choose this.

Another possibility: ""GOOLD"" — not common.

So finally, we guess ""ODDLY"".After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

**Known Information Summary:**
1. **Absent Letters**: R, A, I, S, E, M, U, N, T, B, C, K (all ✘ from previous guesses).
2. **Present Letters**:
   - **O**: Confirmed in the word but *not* at position 2 (from ""mount"") or position 3 (from ""block"").
   - **L**: Confirmed in the word but *not* at position 2 (from ""block"").
3. **Valid Positions**:
   - O must be at positions 1, 4, or 5.
   - L must be at positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (excluding position 2).
4. **Remaining Letters**: Available consonants/vowels to test: D, F, G, H, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

**Constraints for the New Guess**:
- Must include both **O** and **L**.
- Avoid positions forbidden for O (2, 3) and L (2).
- Use only untested letters (no R, A, I, S, E, M, U, N, T, B, C, K) to maximize new information.

**Strategically Selected Word: ""ODDLY""**

- **Word Validation**: ""ODDLY"" is a valid English word (adverb meaning unusually or remarkably).
- **Risk**: Double D may reduce information gain vs. distinct letters, but available word options are limited. This tests D/Y and positions of O/L efficiently.

If ""ODDLY"" feedback confirms D/Y presence, it will narrow down the remaining possibilities significantly.",Guess 4: oddly -> FEEDBACK: O(✓) D(✓) D(✓) L(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
