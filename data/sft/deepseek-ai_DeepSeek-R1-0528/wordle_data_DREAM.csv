We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we should choose a word that maximizes the information we can get. 
Common starting words in Wordle often include letters that are frequent in English and cover multiple common vowels and consonants.

I will choose a starting word that has five distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.

One popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has three common consonants (C, R, N) and one common vowel (A, E). However, let me consider alternatives. Another good word is ""SLATE"" or ""ROATE"". 

I decide to use ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E. 

So my first guess will be: CRANE

But note: the problem example used ""STORM"", ""BRAVE"", ""BRISK"", but that's just an example.

Therefore:
<guess> crane </guess>
</think>
I'm starting with a common initial guess that includes frequent vowels and consonants to maximize early feedback. The word ""CRANE"" contains common letters (C, R, A, N, E) that appear in many English words. This helps test multiple letter positions simultaneously, making the feedback efficient for narrowing down possibilities in subsequent guesses.

We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the secret word)
- R: ✓ (correct letter in correct position, so the second letter is R)
- A: - (letter A is in the word but not in the second position? Actually, A is the third letter in ""crane"", but the feedback says ""-"", meaning A is in the word but not in that position. So A is present elsewhere.)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (letter E is in the word but not in the fifth position)

We know:
- The secret word has the letter R as the second letter (because we have a ✓ on R at position 2).
- The secret word also contains A and E, but not in the positions we guessed (A not at position 3, E not at position 5).
- The letters C and N are not in the word at all.

Since R is fixed at position 2, and A and E are present but not in position 3 and 5 respectively, we must choose a new word that:
- Has R at position 2.
- Includes A and E (but not at position 3 or 5? Note: the positions we now avoid for A are position 3 and for E position 5, but they could be in other positions).
- Does not include C or N.

Additionally, we want to test other letters to cover more possibilities.

Let me think of words that have R as the second letter and contain A and E.

Possible positions for A: since it isn't at position 3, it could be at position 1, 4, or 5? But note, we don't know that A isn't at position 1, 4, or 5 from this feedback. Similarly, E isn't at position 5, so it could be at position 1, 2 (but 2 is R so no), 3, or 4.

Therefore, A and E must appear in positions 1,4,5? But position 2 is R. The word has positions 1,2,3,4,5.

Letter positions:
Position 1: unknown, but cannot be C or N, and since R is at 2, the first letter can be anything else except C and N (and must include A or E? Actually, the word must contain both A and E somewhere).

So:
- Position 2 = R (fixed)
- The word contains A and E, but:
    - A cannot be at position 3 (from the feedback of ""crane"", since A was at pos 3 and got ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not at this position)
    - E cannot be at position 5 (from ""crane"", E at pos 5 got ""-"")

Therefore, A must be in positions 1, 4, or 5? But position 5 was E in the previous guess? Actually, we can use A and E in other spots.

Possible spots for A: 1, 4, 5? (but 5 might be occupied by something else). Similarly, E must be in 1,3,4? (cannot be in 2 or 5? But 2 is R and E was at 5 and got ""-"", so E is not at 5 but might be at 1,3,4).

Also, remember that the secret word might have more letters than A and E? But at least A and E are present.

Now, we must avoid C and N.

Ideal next guess: include A and E in positions we haven't ruled out, and introduce new letters to test.

Let me try to think of words with R as the second letter, containing A and E, avoiding C and N.

For example:
- Position 1: can be a vowel or consonant? We have to put a letter that isn't C or N. Ideally, we test other common consonants too.

List some possibilities:
- The word starts with a letter? Options: beginning with A? Then the word would be A R ... 
Examples: ARISE? But we have E present, and in ""arise"", E is at the end? But in our feedback, E cannot be at position 5? Wait, so if we use ""arise"", E would be at position 5? That was ruled out because in ""crane"" it was at 5 and got ""-"" meaning E is in the word but not at position 5.

Therefore, we cannot put E at position 5 in our next guess? Actually, we can, but from the feedback we know that in the secret word, E isn't at position 5? So we don't want to put E at 5 in our guess? Actually, we need to try other positions for E.

Similarly, we know A is not at position 3? So we should not put A at position 3 again? Correct.

So we need:
- A not at position 3
- E not at position 5

In ""crane"", A was at 3 and got ""-"", E at 5 got ""-"".

So for our new guess:
- Position 2 must be R: _ R _ _ _
- Must include A and E, but:
    - A: not at position 3? Actually, we can put A at position 1,4, or 5? But position 5 might be used for the E we cannot put there? So let's avoid redundancies.

Also, note that we have only two letters confirmed: one fixed (R at 2) and two floating (A and E).

So the pattern is: [letter, R, ?, ?, ?] and the word must contain A and E.

We can try to put:
- A at position 1: so A R ? ? ? 
- Then E can be at position 3,4? Or position 5? But E cannot be at position 5? Actually, we know that E is not at position 5 in the secret word? So we should avoid putting E at 5? Actually, we can put E at 5 to test? But if we put E at 5, the feedback will be ""-"" again if the secret word does have E but not at 5? But we already know E is in the word? So we don't need to retest E? But we don't know exactly where E is? So we need to test E in other positions.

Ideally, we should test E in a new position where it hasn't been tested? In ""crane"", E was tested only at position 5 and got ""-"". So we should try E in positions 1,3, or 4? Similarly, A was tested only at position 3? So we should try A in positions 1,4, or 5.

But note: we also want to learn about other letters? So we should use a word that introduces new letters besides the ones we know? Since C and N are ruled out, and R,A,E are in, we need two other letters?

The word has five letters? We know: one letter R (at position 2), and two letters A and E, and we need to cover two more unknown positions? Plus, we don't know if there are duplicates? But generally, assume no duplicates? Unless feedback suggests otherwise? But we haven't seen duplicates so far.

So the secret word must have five distinct letters? Not necessarily? But it could have duplicates? However, in Wordle sometimes words have repeated letters? But let's assume we don't know? But for strategy, we usually assume distinct until proven otherwise? But here we have to be careful? Actually, the feedback we got: for ""crane"" we have one ✓, two - , and two x? So if letters repeated? We don't know? But since C and N are out, and A and E are present? And R is fixed? We should pick a word that introduces two new letters? But also includes A and E and R at 2? Obviously.

How about a word that starts with a vowel or consonant? Let me brainstorm:

Examples:
- Starting with A: A R _ _ _
  - Must include E? Possible words: ARETE? But T might be new? And E at position 4? But also has two E? Moreover, E at position 5? We shouldn't put E at 5? In ""ARETE"": positions: A, R, E, T, E? But E at position 3 and 5? 
    - But we know E is not at position 5? So that would cause one E to be at 5? Not good? Also, the feedback ""-"" for E in position 5 might not show duplicates? Actually, the game handle duplicates? But in our case, we need to consider.

But let me think of simple words: 
- ARISE? But as I thought, in ARISE, E is at position 5? We know E is not at 5? So avoid words ending in E? Or try words with E elsewhere? So E must be in 1,3,4?

Similarly, A must avoid position 3? So in a 5-letter word with R at 2:

Position 1: A? Then A R ... and then E? At position 3? That might be okay? Or position 4? 

Example word: ARISE? But E at 5? No? 
- How about A R E S ??? No word?
- Alternatively, words with A at 1 and E at 4: A R ? E ? 
For example: ARMED? But D is new? And M? But in ARM?ED: check letters: A, R, M, E, D? But we have M? Is that okay?

Remember: N and C are out? So we can include other letters.

Also, we know E cannot be at 5? So with ARMED: A R M E D? E is at position 4? Which is acceptable? And A is at 1, which is a new position? And E at 4? New position? So let's see:

ARMED: with positions 1: A, 2: R, 3: M, 4: E, 5: D

But A was previously at position 3? Now we try at position 1? And E was at position 5? Now we try at position 4? 

But we need to test the unknown? Also, M and D are new letters? So we can get feedback on M and D? And A at 1, E at 4? And R fixed at 2? So this seems reasonable? 

However, note: we don't know if A is at position 1? We are testing it? Similarly, we don't know about E at 4? It might be correct? Or wrong? 

Another option: put E at position 1? So E R _ _ _ ...? Then A at? Position 4 or 5? But E is at position 1? 

For example: EXPERT? But E at position 1? And X? But we don't know? But EXPERT has E at 1? Then R at 2? But position 2 is R? So E R ...? Words? Like: E R R O R? But repeated R? Or E R A S E? But A at position 4? But we have A and E?

ERASE: E, R, A, S, E? Has E at position 1 and 5? But we know E is not at position 5? So avoid? Then ER? Another word: ER? Like ERASE? Or ERUPT? But U? But in ERUPT: E R U P T? Has U,P,T? And no A? But wait, we must include A? Because A is in the secret word? So we must include A in our guess? Otherwise, we won't get feedback about A?

Important: since we know A is in the word? We must include it? Similarly, E is in? So we must include both? That's crucial? Because we don't know where A and E are? So to get positional feedback? We have to include them?

Therefore, our next guess must contain A, E, and R at position 2? And avoid C and N? And introduce two new letters? And also place A and E in positions that are allowed? Meaning, A not at 3? E not at 5? And we test them in new spots?

So words: 
- With E at 1? And A at 4? For example: E R A T A? But duplicate A? Let me think of words: something like E R R A? No? 
- E R? Words: ERASE? But E at 1? A at 3? But A must avoid position 3? Because in ""crane"" A was at 3 and got ""-"" meaning not? So we should not put A at 3? So ERASE: positions: E at 1? R at 2? A at 3? Then S? E at 5? But E at 5? We know E cannot be at 5? And A at 3? We know A isn't at 3? So ERASE is not suitable? Because putting A at 3 which we know is wrong? And E at 5 which is also wrong? 

So maybe avoid?

Then let's think of putting A at position 1? And E at position 4? Like AR?E?: ARM?E? So ARED? Not a word? ARENA? But has N? Which we know is out? So no? ARENA has N? Excluded? 

AROSE: or ARISE? But ARISE: A, R, I, S, E? Then E at position 5? Which is forbidden? 

AROSE? O? And E? AROSE: A, R, O, S, E? Again E at 5? 

How about A R M E? But need a letter? ARM?E? Words: ARM?E? Like ARMED? Or ARMOR? But no E? And duplicate R? 

So ARMED: A, R, M, E, D? This is valid? 
- Positions: 
  1: A (testing A at first position)
  2: R (fixed and correct)
  3: M (new letter? Testing)
  4: E (testing E at 4? since we know E isn't at 5? Position 4 is new? Previously tested position 5? 
  5: D (new letter)

This should work? 

But another idea: put E at position 1 and A at position 4? For example: E R A? A? But E R A? Words: ERA?S? No? Or E R O? But doesn't include A? 

Possible word: EGRET? But E at 1 and? G,R,E,T? Duplicate E? And E at 5? Which is forbidden? So not? 

Another: EXALT? But X, A,L,T? EXALT: E, X, A, L, T? But position 2 is X? But we need position 2 to be R? 

So words with E at 1 and R at 2: ERUPT, ERASE, ERROR? But ERROR has duplicate R? And doesn't include A? 

So maybe no words of that form? 

Then how about A at position 4 and E at position 3? But we know A cannot be at position 3? E at position 3? As in ""crane"" E was at 5? So position 3 is untested? So can we? 

Word with A at 4 and E at 3? Pattern: _ R E A _? And must have E? At position 3? And A at 4? Then last letter? 

Possible word: O R E A L?? No? Like OR? But we need a word. R E A L? But position 1? Start with? FOR? Five letters: For example, OREAD? O R E A D? But then E at position 3? And A at position 4? Then D at 5? 

OREAD? Is that a word? Or? Maybe? OREAD? Actually, Oread is a mountain nymph in Greek mythology? So accept in Wordle? Probably? 

But OREAD: O, R, E, A, D? Now, O is a vowel? But it includes O? 

But we don't know? 

Alternatively, TR?E?A? But T R E A D? But E at position 3? And A at 4? Then D? TREAD? 

TREAD? T, R, E, A, D? 
Then positions: 
  1: T
  2: R (fixed)
  3: E
  4: A
  5: D

This includes A and E? And R at 2? 
Now, A was tested at position 3? Now we test at position 4? And E was tested at position 5? Now we test at position 3? 

But in ""crane"", A was at position 3? Got ""-"", meaning A is in the secret word but not at position 3? So we test position 4? Similarly, E was at position 5? Got ""-"", so not at 5? We are testing position 3? 

Also, we avoid C and N? So T,R,E,A,D? Is TREAD a valid word? Yes? 

Now, compared to ARMED? Both use different letters? 

I think TREAD or ARMED should be okay? 

But let me check: in TREAD? Letters T,R,E,A,D? 

But note: we also want to cover common letters? 

ARMED: A,R,M,E,D? 

Now, both introduce M and D? vs T,R,E,A,D? Wait? TREAD has T? 

Perhaps it's arbitrary? 

Another common word? Or? 

But we have only limited guesses? 

Actually, I think either is fine? Let me pick one? 

But note: in ARMED? We have A at position 1? Is that likely? The previous feedback? 

Also, we have E at position 4? 

In TREAD? T at position 1? Then E at position 3? And A at position 4? 

Now, we don't know? 

Perhaps ARMED is better? Because? In the feedback of ""crane"", we had R at position 2 correct? And A at 3? Wrong position? So A must be elsewhere? Position 1? Or 4? or 5? Similarly E must be elsewhere? 

Some Wordle solvers use algorithmically chosen? But for now? 

I will go with ARMED? Because it tests A at position 1? Which might be common? 

But let me see? Alternatively? We can try BAR?E? But we don't know? 

Other? 

For example: HEART? But H? E,A,R,T? But R is at position 3? But we need R at position 2? So? Let's rule out? 

Another word: PAR?E? Like? PARED? But E at 5? Not allowed? 

So ARMED? Seems okay? 

Or? EVADE? But E at 1? Then V? Then A at 3? But we know A not at 3? So avoid? 

So I think ARMED is a good candidate? 

Then let me choose ARMED? 

But note: the word ARMED means equipped with weapons? 

Yes? 

So? 

So guess: ""armed""

Now? But we don't violate any rules? 

Summary: 
- Avoided placing A at position 3? (here A at 1? And E at 4? Not 5?) 
- Avoided letters C and N? 
- Included R at position 2? 
- Included A and E? 
- Introduced M and D? 

So? 

But note: in ARMED? The E is at position 4? Previously in ""crane"", E was at position 5? So we test a new position? 

Similarly, A? At position 1? Previously at 3? 

Okay? 

Therefore, our guess is ""armed"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
- C: not in the word (x) 
- R: correct letter and position (✓)  
- A: in the word but wrong position (-)  
- N: not in the word (x)  
- E: in the word but wrong position (-)

Key insights:
- The second letter is definitely R (✓ confirmed).
- A and E are present somewhere in the word, but not in positions 3 (from ""crane"") and 5 (from ""crane""), respectively.
- C and N are absent.
- The word must include A and E, with R fixed at position 2.

For the new guess:
- Position 2 must remain R.
- A must be placed in a new position (not 3) to test its location—position 1 is chosen here.
- E must be placed in a new position (not 5) to test its location—position 4 is chosen here.
- Avoid C and N, and introduce new common consonants to gather more information (M and D in this case).
- The word ""armed"" fits these criteria:  
  - Pattern: A (position 1), R (position 2), M (new), E (position 4), D (new)  
  - Tests A at position 1 and E at position 4.

<guess>armed</guess>",armed,"We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the secret word)
- R: ✓ (correct letter in correct position, so the second letter is R)
- A: - (letter A is in the word but not in the second position? Actually, A is the third letter in ""crane"", but the feedback says ""-"", meaning A is in the word but not in that position. So A is present elsewhere.)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (letter E is in the word but not in the fifth position)

We know:
- The secret word has the letter R as the second letter (because we have a ✓ on R at position 2).
- The secret word also contains A and E, but not in the positions we guessed (A not at position 3, E not at position 5).
- The letters C and N are not in the word at all.

Since R is fixed at position 2, and A and E are present but not in position 3 and 5 respectively, we must choose a new word that:
- Has R at position 2.
- Includes A and E (but not at position 3 or 5? Note: the positions we now avoid for A are position 3 and for E position 5, but they could be in other positions).
- Does not include C or N.

Additionally, we want to test other letters to cover more possibilities.

Let me think of words that have R as the second letter and contain A and E.

Possible positions for A: since it isn't at position 3, it could be at position 1, 4, or 5? But note, we don't know that A isn't at position 1, 4, or 5 from this feedback. Similarly, E isn't at position 5, so it could be at position 1, 2 (but 2 is R so no), 3, or 4.

Therefore, A and E must appear in positions 1,4,5? But position 2 is R. The word has positions 1,2,3,4,5.

Letter positions:
Position 1: unknown, but cannot be C or N, and since R is at 2, the first letter can be anything else except C and N (and must include A or E? Actually, the word must contain both A and E somewhere).

So:
- Position 2 = R (fixed)
- The word contains A and E, but:
    - A cannot be at position 3 (from the feedback of ""crane"", since A was at pos 3 and got ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not at this position)
    - E cannot be at position 5 (from ""crane"", E at pos 5 got ""-"")

Therefore, A must be in positions 1, 4, or 5? But position 5 was E in the previous guess? Actually, we can use A and E in other spots.

Possible spots for A: 1, 4, 5? (but 5 might be occupied by something else). Similarly, E must be in 1,3,4? (cannot be in 2 or 5? But 2 is R and E was at 5 and got ""-"", so E is not at 5 but might be at 1,3,4).

Also, remember that the secret word might have more letters than A and E? But at least A and E are present.

Now, we must avoid C and N.

Ideal next guess: include A and E in positions we haven't ruled out, and introduce new letters to test.

Let me try to think of words with R as the second letter, containing A and E, avoiding C and N.

For example:
- Position 1: can be a vowel or consonant? We have to put a letter that isn't C or N. Ideally, we test other common consonants too.

List some possibilities:
- The word starts with a letter? Options: beginning with A? Then the word would be A R ... 
Examples: ARISE? But we have E present, and in ""arise"", E is at the end? But in our feedback, E cannot be at position 5? Wait, so if we use ""arise"", E would be at position 5? That was ruled out because in ""crane"" it was at 5 and got ""-"" meaning E is in the word but not at position 5.

Therefore, we cannot put E at position 5 in our next guess? Actually, we can, but from the feedback we know that in the secret word, E isn't at position 5? So we don't want to put E at 5 in our guess? Actually, we need to try other positions for E.

Similarly, we know A is not at position 3? So we should not put A at position 3 again? Correct.

So we need:
- A not at position 3
- E not at position 5

In ""crane"", A was at 3 and got ""-"", E at 5 got ""-"".

So for our new guess:
- Position 2 must be R: _ R _ _ _
- Must include A and E, but:
    - A: not at position 3? Actually, we can put A at position 1,4, or 5? But position 5 might be used for the E we cannot put there? So let's avoid redundancies.

Also, note that we have only two letters confirmed: one fixed (R at 2) and two floating (A and E).

So the pattern is: [letter, R, ?, ?, ?] and the word must contain A and E.

We can try to put:
- A at position 1: so A R ? ? ? 
- Then E can be at position 3,4? Or position 5? But E cannot be at position 5? Actually, we know that E is not at position 5 in the secret word? So we should avoid putting E at 5? Actually, we can put E at 5 to test? But if we put E at 5, the feedback will be ""-"" again if the secret word does have E but not at 5? But we already know E is in the word? So we don't need to retest E? But we don't know exactly where E is? So we need to test E in other positions.

Ideally, we should test E in a new position where it hasn't been tested? In ""crane"", E was tested only at position 5 and got ""-"". So we should try E in positions 1,3, or 4? Similarly, A was tested only at position 3? So we should try A in positions 1,4, or 5.

But note: we also want to learn about other letters? So we should use a word that introduces new letters besides the ones we know? Since C and N are ruled out, and R,A,E are in, we need two other letters?

The word has five letters? We know: one letter R (at position 2), and two letters A and E, and we need to cover two more unknown positions? Plus, we don't know if there are duplicates? But generally, assume no duplicates? Unless feedback suggests otherwise? But we haven't seen duplicates so far.

So the secret word must have five distinct letters? Not necessarily? But it could have duplicates? However, in Wordle sometimes words have repeated letters? But let's assume we don't know? But for strategy, we usually assume distinct until proven otherwise? But here we have to be careful? Actually, the feedback we got: for ""crane"" we have one ✓, two - , and two x? So if letters repeated? We don't know? But since C and N are out, and A and E are present? And R is fixed? We should pick a word that introduces two new letters? But also includes A and E and R at 2? Obviously.

How about a word that starts with a vowel or consonant? Let me brainstorm:

Examples:
- Starting with A: A R _ _ _
  - Must include E? Possible words: ARETE? But T might be new? And E at position 4? But also has two E? Moreover, E at position 5? We shouldn't put E at 5? In ""ARETE"": positions: A, R, E, T, E? But E at position 3 and 5? 
    - But we know E is not at position 5? So that would cause one E to be at 5? Not good? Also, the feedback ""-"" for E in position 5 might not show duplicates? Actually, the game handle duplicates? But in our case, we need to consider.

But let me think of simple words: 
- ARISE? But as I thought, in ARISE, E is at position 5? We know E is not at 5? So avoid words ending in E? Or try words with E elsewhere? So E must be in 1,3,4?

Similarly, A must avoid position 3? So in a 5-letter word with R at 2:

Position 1: A? Then A R ... and then E? At position 3? That might be okay? Or position 4? 

Example word: ARISE? But E at 5? No? 
- How about A R E S ??? No word?
- Alternatively, words with A at 1 and E at 4: A R ? E ? 
For example: ARMED? But D is new? And M? But in ARM?ED: check letters: A, R, M, E, D? But we have M? Is that okay?

Remember: N and C are out? So we can include other letters.

Also, we know E cannot be at 5? So with ARMED: A R M E D? E is at position 4? Which is acceptable? And A is at 1, which is a new position? And E at 4? New position? So let's see:

ARMED: with positions 1: A, 2: R, 3: M, 4: E, 5: D

But A was previously at position 3? Now we try at position 1? And E was at position 5? Now we try at position 4? 

But we need to test the unknown? Also, M and D are new letters? So we can get feedback on M and D? And A at 1, E at 4? And R fixed at 2? So this seems reasonable? 

However, note: we don't know if A is at position 1? We are testing it? Similarly, we don't know about E at 4? It might be correct? Or wrong? 

Another option: put E at position 1? So E R _ _ _ ...? Then A at? Position 4 or 5? But E is at position 1? 

For example: EXPERT? But E at position 1? And X? But we don't know? But EXPERT has E at 1? Then R at 2? But position 2 is R? So E R ...? Words? Like: E R R O R? But repeated R? Or E R A S E? But A at position 4? But we have A and E?

ERASE: E, R, A, S, E? Has E at position 1 and 5? But we know E is not at position 5? So avoid? Then ER? Another word: ER? Like ERASE? Or ERUPT? But U? But in ERUPT: E R U P T? Has U,P,T? And no A? But wait, we must include A? Because A is in the secret word? So we must include A in our guess? Otherwise, we won't get feedback about A?

Important: since we know A is in the word? We must include it? Similarly, E is in? So we must include both? That's crucial? Because we don't know where A and E are? So to get positional feedback? We have to include them?

Therefore, our next guess must contain A, E, and R at position 2? And avoid C and N? And introduce two new letters? And also place A and E in positions that are allowed? Meaning, A not at 3? E not at 5? And we test them in new spots?

So words: 
- With E at 1? And A at 4? For example: E R A T A? But duplicate A? Let me think of words: something like E R R A? No? 
- E R? Words: ERASE? But E at 1? A at 3? But A must avoid position 3? Because in ""crane"" A was at 3 and got ""-"" meaning not? So we should not put A at 3? So ERASE: positions: E at 1? R at 2? A at 3? Then S? E at 5? But E at 5? We know E cannot be at 5? And A at 3? We know A isn't at 3? So ERASE is not suitable? Because putting A at 3 which we know is wrong? And E at 5 which is also wrong? 

So maybe avoid?

Then let's think of putting A at position 1? And E at position 4? Like AR?E?: ARM?E? So ARED? Not a word? ARENA? But has N? Which we know is out? So no? ARENA has N? Excluded? 

AROSE: or ARISE? But ARISE: A, R, I, S, E? Then E at position 5? Which is forbidden? 

AROSE? O? And E? AROSE: A, R, O, S, E? Again E at 5? 

How about A R M E? But need a letter? ARM?E? Words: ARM?E? Like ARMED? Or ARMOR? But no E? And duplicate R? 

So ARMED: A, R, M, E, D? This is valid? 
- Positions: 
  1: A (testing A at first position)
  2: R (fixed and correct)
  3: M (new letter? Testing)
  4: E (testing E at 4? since we know E isn't at 5? Position 4 is new? Previously tested position 5? 
  5: D (new letter)

This should work? 

But another idea: put E at position 1 and A at position 4? For example: E R A? A? But E R A? Words: ERA?S? No? Or E R O? But doesn't include A? 

Possible word: EGRET? But E at 1 and? G,R,E,T? Duplicate E? And E at 5? Which is forbidden? So not? 

Another: EXALT? But X, A,L,T? EXALT: E, X, A, L, T? But position 2 is X? But we need position 2 to be R? 

So words with E at 1 and R at 2: ERUPT, ERASE, ERROR? But ERROR has duplicate R? And doesn't include A? 

So maybe no words of that form? 

Then how about A at position 4 and E at position 3? But we know A cannot be at position 3? E at position 3? As in ""crane"" E was at 5? So position 3 is untested? So can we? 

Word with A at 4 and E at 3? Pattern: _ R E A _? And must have E? At position 3? And A at 4? Then last letter? 

Possible word: O R E A L?? No? Like OR? But we need a word. R E A L? But position 1? Start with? FOR? Five letters: For example, OREAD? O R E A D? But then E at position 3? And A at position 4? Then D at 5? 

OREAD? Is that a word? Or? Maybe? OREAD? Actually, Oread is a mountain nymph in Greek mythology? So accept in Wordle? Probably? 

But OREAD: O, R, E, A, D? Now, O is a vowel? But it includes O? 

But we don't know? 

Alternatively, TR?E?A? But T R E A D? But E at position 3? And A at 4? Then D? TREAD? 

TREAD? T, R, E, A, D? 
Then positions: 
  1: T
  2: R (fixed)
  3: E
  4: A
  5: D

This includes A and E? And R at 2? 
Now, A was tested at position 3? Now we test at position 4? And E was tested at position 5? Now we test at position 3? 

But in ""crane"", A was at position 3? Got ""-"", meaning A is in the secret word but not at position 3? So we test position 4? Similarly, E was at position 5? Got ""-"", so not at 5? We are testing position 3? 

Also, we avoid C and N? So T,R,E,A,D? Is TREAD a valid word? Yes? 

Now, compared to ARMED? Both use different letters? 

I think TREAD or ARMED should be okay? 

But let me check: in TREAD? Letters T,R,E,A,D? 

But note: we also want to cover common letters? 

ARMED: A,R,M,E,D? 

Now, both introduce M and D? vs T,R,E,A,D? Wait? TREAD has T? 

Perhaps it's arbitrary? 

Another common word? Or? 

But we have only limited guesses? 

Actually, I think either is fine? Let me pick one? 

But note: in ARMED? We have A at position 1? Is that likely? The previous feedback? 

Also, we have E at position 4? 

In TREAD? T at position 1? Then E at position 3? And A at position 4? 

Now, we don't know? 

Perhaps ARMED is better? Because? In the feedback of ""crane"", we had R at position 2 correct? And A at 3? Wrong position? So A must be elsewhere? Position 1? Or 4? or 5? Similarly E must be elsewhere? 

Some Wordle solvers use algorithmically chosen? But for now? 

I will go with ARMED? Because it tests A at position 1? Which might be common? 

But let me see? Alternatively? We can try BAR?E? But we don't know? 

Other? 

For example: HEART? But H? E,A,R,T? But R is at position 3? But we need R at position 2? So? Let's rule out? 

Another word: PAR?E? Like? PARED? But E at 5? Not allowed? 

So ARMED? Seems okay? 

Or? EVADE? But E at 1? Then V? Then A at 3? But we know A not at 3? So avoid? 

So I think ARMED is a good candidate? 

Then let me choose ARMED? 

But note: the word ARMED means equipped with weapons? 

Yes? 

So? 

So guess: ""armed""

Now? But we don't violate any rules? 

Summary: 
- Avoided placing A at position 3? (here A at 1? And E at 4? Not 5?) 
- Avoided letters C and N? 
- Included R at position 2? 
- Included A and E? 
- Introduced M and D? 

So? 

But note: in ARMED? The E is at position 4? Previously in ""crane"", E was at position 5? So we test a new position? 

Similarly, A? At position 1? Previously at 3? 

Okay? 

Therefore, our guess is ""armed"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
- C: not in the word (x) 
- R: correct letter and position (✓)  
- A: in the word but wrong position (-)  
- N: not in the word (x)  
- E: in the word but wrong position (-)

Key insights:
- The second letter is definitely R (✓ confirmed).
- A and E are present somewhere in the word, but not in positions 3 (from ""crane"") and 5 (from ""crane""), respectively.
- C and N are absent.
- The word must include A and E, with R fixed at position 2.

For the new guess:
- Position 2 must remain R.
- A must be placed in a new position (not 3) to test its location—position 1 is chosen here.
- E must be placed in a new position (not 5) to test its location—position 4 is chosen here.
- Avoid C and N, and introduce new common consonants to gather more information (M and D in this case).
- The word ""armed"" fits these criteria:  
  - Pattern: A (position 1), R (position 2), M (new), E (position 4), D (new)  
  - Tests A at position 1 and E at position 4.",Guess 2: armed -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(✓) M(-) E(-) D(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,DREAM,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we should choose a word that maximizes the information we can get. 
Common starting words in Wordle often include letters that are frequent in English and cover multiple common vowels and consonants.

I will choose a starting word that has five distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.

One popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has three common consonants (C, R, N) and one common vowel (A, E). However, let me consider alternatives. Another good word is ""SLATE"" or ""ROATE"". 

I decide to use ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E. 

So my first guess will be: CRANE

But note: the problem example used ""STORM"", ""BRAVE"", ""BRISK"", but that's just an example.

Therefore:
<guess> crane </guess>I'm starting with a common initial guess that includes frequent vowels and consonants to maximize early feedback. The word ""CRANE"" contains common letters (C, R, A, N, E) that appear in many English words. This helps test multiple letter positions simultaneously, making the feedback efficient for narrowing down possibilities in subsequent guesses.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the secret word)
- R: ✓ (correct letter in correct position, so the second letter is R)
- A: - (letter A is in the word but not in the second position? Actually, A is the third letter in ""crane"", but the feedback says ""-"", meaning A is in the word but not in that position. So A is present elsewhere.)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (letter E is in the word but not in the fifth position)

We know:
- The secret word has the letter R as the second letter (because we have a ✓ on R at position 2).
- The secret word also contains A and E, but not in the positions we guessed (A not at position 3, E not at position 5).
- The letters C and N are not in the word at all.

Since R is fixed at position 2, and A and E are present but not in position 3 and 5 respectively, we must choose a new word that:
- Has R at position 2.
- Includes A and E (but not at position 3 or 5? Note: the positions we now avoid for A are position 3 and for E position 5, but they could be in other positions).
- Does not include C or N.

Additionally, we want to test other letters to cover more possibilities.

Let me think of words that have R as the second letter and contain A and E.

Possible positions for A: since it isn't at position 3, it could be at position 1, 4, or 5? But note, we don't know that A isn't at position 1, 4, or 5 from this feedback. Similarly, E isn't at position 5, so it could be at position 1, 2 (but 2 is R so no), 3, or 4.

Therefore, A and E must appear in positions 1,4,5? But position 2 is R. The word has positions 1,2,3,4,5.

Letter positions:
Position 1: unknown, but cannot be C or N, and since R is at 2, the first letter can be anything else except C and N (and must include A or E? Actually, the word must contain both A and E somewhere).

So:
- Position 2 = R (fixed)
- The word contains A and E, but:
    - A cannot be at position 3 (from the feedback of ""crane"", since A was at pos 3 and got ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not at this position)
    - E cannot be at position 5 (from ""crane"", E at pos 5 got ""-"")

Therefore, A must be in positions 1, 4, or 5? But position 5 was E in the previous guess? Actually, we can use A and E in other spots.

Possible spots for A: 1, 4, 5? (but 5 might be occupied by something else). Similarly, E must be in 1,3,4? (cannot be in 2 or 5? But 2 is R and E was at 5 and got ""-"", so E is not at 5 but might be at 1,3,4).

Also, remember that the secret word might have more letters than A and E? But at least A and E are present.

Now, we must avoid C and N.

Ideal next guess: include A and E in positions we haven't ruled out, and introduce new letters to test.

Let me try to think of words with R as the second letter, containing A and E, avoiding C and N.

For example:
- Position 1: can be a vowel or consonant? We have to put a letter that isn't C or N. Ideally, we test other common consonants too.

List some possibilities:
- The word starts with a letter? Options: beginning with A? Then the word would be A R ... 
Examples: ARISE? But we have E present, and in ""arise"", E is at the end? But in our feedback, E cannot be at position 5? Wait, so if we use ""arise"", E would be at position 5? That was ruled out because in ""crane"" it was at 5 and got ""-"" meaning E is in the word but not at position 5.

Therefore, we cannot put E at position 5 in our next guess? Actually, we can, but from the feedback we know that in the secret word, E isn't at position 5? So we don't want to put E at 5 in our guess? Actually, we need to try other positions for E.

Similarly, we know A is not at position 3? So we should not put A at position 3 again? Correct.

So we need:
- A not at position 3
- E not at position 5

In ""crane"", A was at 3 and got ""-"", E at 5 got ""-"".

So for our new guess:
- Position 2 must be R: _ R _ _ _
- Must include A and E, but:
    - A: not at position 3? Actually, we can put A at position 1,4, or 5? But position 5 might be used for the E we cannot put there? So let's avoid redundancies.

Also, note that we have only two letters confirmed: one fixed (R at 2) and two floating (A and E).

So the pattern is: [letter, R, ?, ?, ?] and the word must contain A and E.

We can try to put:
- A at position 1: so A R ? ? ? 
- Then E can be at position 3,4? Or position 5? But E cannot be at position 5? Actually, we know that E is not at position 5 in the secret word? So we should avoid putting E at 5? Actually, we can put E at 5 to test? But if we put E at 5, the feedback will be ""-"" again if the secret word does have E but not at 5? But we already know E is in the word? So we don't need to retest E? But we don't know exactly where E is? So we need to test E in other positions.

Ideally, we should test E in a new position where it hasn't been tested? In ""crane"", E was tested only at position 5 and got ""-"". So we should try E in positions 1,3, or 4? Similarly, A was tested only at position 3? So we should try A in positions 1,4, or 5.

But note: we also want to learn about other letters? So we should use a word that introduces new letters besides the ones we know? Since C and N are ruled out, and R,A,E are in, we need two other letters?

The word has five letters? We know: one letter R (at position 2), and two letters A and E, and we need to cover two more unknown positions? Plus, we don't know if there are duplicates? But generally, assume no duplicates? Unless feedback suggests otherwise? But we haven't seen duplicates so far.

So the secret word must have five distinct letters? Not necessarily? But it could have duplicates? However, in Wordle sometimes words have repeated letters? But let's assume we don't know? But for strategy, we usually assume distinct until proven otherwise? But here we have to be careful? Actually, the feedback we got: for ""crane"" we have one ✓, two - , and two x? So if letters repeated? We don't know? But since C and N are out, and A and E are present? And R is fixed? We should pick a word that introduces two new letters? But also includes A and E and R at 2? Obviously.

How about a word that starts with a vowel or consonant? Let me brainstorm:

Examples:
- Starting with A: A R _ _ _
  - Must include E? Possible words: ARETE? But T might be new? And E at position 4? But also has two E? Moreover, E at position 5? We shouldn't put E at 5? In ""ARETE"": positions: A, R, E, T, E? But E at position 3 and 5? 
    - But we know E is not at position 5? So that would cause one E to be at 5? Not good? Also, the feedback ""-"" for E in position 5 might not show duplicates? Actually, the game handle duplicates? But in our case, we need to consider.

But let me think of simple words: 
- ARISE? But as I thought, in ARISE, E is at position 5? We know E is not at 5? So avoid words ending in E? Or try words with E elsewhere? So E must be in 1,3,4?

Similarly, A must avoid position 3? So in a 5-letter word with R at 2:

Position 1: A? Then A R ... and then E? At position 3? That might be okay? Or position 4? 

Example word: ARISE? But E at 5? No? 
- How about A R E S ??? No word?
- Alternatively, words with A at 1 and E at 4: A R ? E ? 
For example: ARMED? But D is new? And M? But in ARM?ED: check letters: A, R, M, E, D? But we have M? Is that okay?

Remember: N and C are out? So we can include other letters.

Also, we know E cannot be at 5? So with ARMED: A R M E D? E is at position 4? Which is acceptable? And A is at 1, which is a new position? And E at 4? New position? So let's see:

ARMED: with positions 1: A, 2: R, 3: M, 4: E, 5: D

But A was previously at position 3? Now we try at position 1? And E was at position 5? Now we try at position 4? 

But we need to test the unknown? Also, M and D are new letters? So we can get feedback on M and D? And A at 1, E at 4? And R fixed at 2? So this seems reasonable? 

However, note: we don't know if A is at position 1? We are testing it? Similarly, we don't know about E at 4? It might be correct? Or wrong? 

Another option: put E at position 1? So E R _ _ _ ...? Then A at? Position 4 or 5? But E is at position 1? 

For example: EXPERT? But E at position 1? And X? But we don't know? But EXPERT has E at 1? Then R at 2? But position 2 is R? So E R ...? Words? Like: E R R O R? But repeated R? Or E R A S E? But A at position 4? But we have A and E?

ERASE: E, R, A, S, E? Has E at position 1 and 5? But we know E is not at position 5? So avoid? Then ER? Another word: ER? Like ERASE? Or ERUPT? But U? But in ERUPT: E R U P T? Has U,P,T? And no A? But wait, we must include A? Because A is in the secret word? So we must include A in our guess? Otherwise, we won't get feedback about A?

Important: since we know A is in the word? We must include it? Similarly, E is in? So we must include both? That's crucial? Because we don't know where A and E are? So to get positional feedback? We have to include them?

Therefore, our next guess must contain A, E, and R at position 2? And avoid C and N? And introduce two new letters? And also place A and E in positions that are allowed? Meaning, A not at 3? E not at 5? And we test them in new spots?

So words: 
- With E at 1? And A at 4? For example: E R A T A? But duplicate A? Let me think of words: something like E R R A? No? 
- E R? Words: ERASE? But E at 1? A at 3? But A must avoid position 3? Because in ""crane"" A was at 3 and got ""-"" meaning not? So we should not put A at 3? So ERASE: positions: E at 1? R at 2? A at 3? Then S? E at 5? But E at 5? We know E cannot be at 5? And A at 3? We know A isn't at 3? So ERASE is not suitable? Because putting A at 3 which we know is wrong? And E at 5 which is also wrong? 

So maybe avoid?

Then let's think of putting A at position 1? And E at position 4? Like AR?E?: ARM?E? So ARED? Not a word? ARENA? But has N? Which we know is out? So no? ARENA has N? Excluded? 

AROSE: or ARISE? But ARISE: A, R, I, S, E? Then E at position 5? Which is forbidden? 

AROSE? O? And E? AROSE: A, R, O, S, E? Again E at 5? 

How about A R M E? But need a letter? ARM?E? Words: ARM?E? Like ARMED? Or ARMOR? But no E? And duplicate R? 

So ARMED: A, R, M, E, D? This is valid? 
- Positions: 
  1: A (testing A at first position)
  2: R (fixed and correct)
  3: M (new letter? Testing)
  4: E (testing E at 4? since we know E isn't at 5? Position 4 is new? Previously tested position 5? 
  5: D (new letter)

This should work? 

But another idea: put E at position 1 and A at position 4? For example: E R A? A? But E R A? Words: ERA?S? No? Or E R O? But doesn't include A? 

Possible word: EGRET? But E at 1 and? G,R,E,T? Duplicate E? And E at 5? Which is forbidden? So not? 

Another: EXALT? But X, A,L,T? EXALT: E, X, A, L, T? But position 2 is X? But we need position 2 to be R? 

So words with E at 1 and R at 2: ERUPT, ERASE, ERROR? But ERROR has duplicate R? And doesn't include A? 

So maybe no words of that form? 

Then how about A at position 4 and E at position 3? But we know A cannot be at position 3? E at position 3? As in ""crane"" E was at 5? So position 3 is untested? So can we? 

Word with A at 4 and E at 3? Pattern: _ R E A _? And must have E? At position 3? And A at 4? Then last letter? 

Possible word: O R E A L?? No? Like OR? But we need a word. R E A L? But position 1? Start with? FOR? Five letters: For example, OREAD? O R E A D? But then E at position 3? And A at position 4? Then D at 5? 

OREAD? Is that a word? Or? Maybe? OREAD? Actually, Oread is a mountain nymph in Greek mythology? So accept in Wordle? Probably? 

But OREAD: O, R, E, A, D? Now, O is a vowel? But it includes O? 

But we don't know? 

Alternatively, TR?E?A? But T R E A D? But E at position 3? And A at 4? Then D? TREAD? 

TREAD? T, R, E, A, D? 
Then positions: 
  1: T
  2: R (fixed)
  3: E
  4: A
  5: D

This includes A and E? And R at 2? 
Now, A was tested at position 3? Now we test at position 4? And E was tested at position 5? Now we test at position 3? 

But in ""crane"", A was at position 3? Got ""-"", meaning A is in the secret word but not at position 3? So we test position 4? Similarly, E was at position 5? Got ""-"", so not at 5? We are testing position 3? 

Also, we avoid C and N? So T,R,E,A,D? Is TREAD a valid word? Yes? 

Now, compared to ARMED? Both use different letters? 

I think TREAD or ARMED should be okay? 

But let me check: in TREAD? Letters T,R,E,A,D? 

But note: we also want to cover common letters? 

ARMED: A,R,M,E,D? 

Now, both introduce M and D? vs T,R,E,A,D? Wait? TREAD has T? 

Perhaps it's arbitrary? 

Another common word? Or? 

But we have only limited guesses? 

Actually, I think either is fine? Let me pick one? 

But note: in ARMED? We have A at position 1? Is that likely? The previous feedback? 

Also, we have E at position 4? 

In TREAD? T at position 1? Then E at position 3? And A at position 4? 

Now, we don't know? 

Perhaps ARMED is better? Because? In the feedback of ""crane"", we had R at position 2 correct? And A at 3? Wrong position? So A must be elsewhere? Position 1? Or 4? or 5? Similarly E must be elsewhere? 

Some Wordle solvers use algorithmically chosen? But for now? 

I will go with ARMED? Because it tests A at position 1? Which might be common? 

But let me see? Alternatively? We can try BAR?E? But we don't know? 

Other? 

For example: HEART? But H? E,A,R,T? But R is at position 3? But we need R at position 2? So? Let's rule out? 

Another word: PAR?E? Like? PARED? But E at 5? Not allowed? 

So ARMED? Seems okay? 

Or? EVADE? But E at 1? Then V? Then A at 3? But we know A not at 3? So avoid? 

So I think ARMED is a good candidate? 

Then let me choose ARMED? 

But note: the word ARMED means equipped with weapons? 

Yes? 

So? 

So guess: ""armed""

Now? But we don't violate any rules? 

Summary: 
- Avoided placing A at position 3? (here A at 1? And E at 4? Not 5?) 
- Avoided letters C and N? 
- Included R at position 2? 
- Included A and E? 
- Introduced M and D? 

So? 

But note: in ARMED? The E is at position 4? Previously in ""crane"", E was at position 5? So we test a new position? 

Similarly, A? At position 1? Previously at 3? 

Okay? 

Therefore, our guess is ""armed"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
- C: not in the word (x) 
- R: correct letter and position (✓)  
- A: in the word but wrong position (-)  
- N: not in the word (x)  
- E: in the word but wrong position (-)

Key insights:
- The second letter is definitely R (✓ confirmed).
- A and E are present somewhere in the word, but not in positions 3 (from ""crane"") and 5 (from ""crane""), respectively.
- C and N are absent.
- The word must include A and E, with R fixed at position 2.

For the new guess:
- Position 2 must remain R.
- A must be placed in a new position (not 3) to test its location—position 1 is chosen here.
- E must be placed in a new position (not 5) to test its location—position 4 is chosen here.
- Avoid C and N, and introduce new common consonants to gather more information (M and D in this case).
- The word ""armed"" fits these criteria:  
  - Pattern: A (position 1), R (position 2), M (new), E (position 4), D (new)  
  - Tests A at position 1 and E at position 4.

Since we have no prior information, we should choose a word that maximizes the information we can get. \nCommon starting words in Wordle often include letters that are frequent in English and cover multiple common vowels and consonants.\n\nI will choose a starting word that has five distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.\n\nOne popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has three common consonants (C, R, N) and one common vowel (A, E). However, let me consider alternatives. Another good word is ""SLATE"" or ""ROATE"". \n\nI decide to use ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E. \n\nSo my first guess will be: CRANE\n\nBut note: the problem example used ""STORM"", ""BRAVE"", ""BRISK"", but that\'s just an example.\n\nTherefore:\n<guess> crane </guess>I\'m starting with a common initial guess that includes frequent vowels and consonants to maximize early feedback.

This helps test multiple letter positions simultaneously, making the feedback efficient for narrowing down possibilities in subsequent guesses.\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"":\n- C: x (not in the secret word)\n- R: ✓ (correct letter in correct position, so the second letter is R)\n- A: - (letter A is in the word but not in the second position? Actually, A is the third letter in ""crane"", but the feedback says ""-"", meaning A is in the word but not in that position. So A is present elsewhere.)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: - (letter E is in the word but not in the fifth position)\n\nWe know:\n- The secret word has the letter R as the second letter (because we have a ✓ on R at position 2).\n- The secret word also contains A and E, but not in the positions we guessed (A not at position 3, E not at position 5).\n- The letters C and N are not in the word at all.\n\nSince R is fixed at position 2, and A and E are present but not in position 3 and 5 respectively, we must choose a new word that:\n- Has R at position 2.\n- Includes A and E (but not at position 3 or 5? Note: the positions we now avoid for A are position 3 and for E position 5, but they could be in other positions).\n- Does not include C or N.\n\nAdditionally, we want to test other letters to cover more possibilities.\n\nLet me think of words that have R as the second letter and contain A and E.\n\nPossible positions for A: since it isn\'t at position 3, it could be at position 1, 4, or 5? But note, we don\'t know that A isn\'t at position 1, 4, or 5 from this feedback. Similarly, E isn\'t at position 5, so it could be at position 1, 2 (but 2 is R so no), 3, or 4.\n\nTherefore, A and E must appear in positions 1,4,5? But position 2 is R. The word has positions 1,2,3,4,5.\n\nLetter positions:\nPosition 1: unknown, but cannot be C or N, and since R is at 2, the first letter can be anything else except C and N (and must include A or E? Actually, the word must contain both A and E somewhere).\n\nSo:\n- Position 2 = R (fixed)\n- The word contains A and E, but:\n    - A cannot be at position 3 (from the feedback of ""crane"", since A was at pos 3 and got ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not at this position)\n    - E cannot be at position 5 (from ""crane"", E at pos 5 got ""-"")\n\nTherefore, A must be in positions 1, 4, or 5? But position 5 was E in the previous guess? Actually, we can use A and E in other spots.\n\nPossible spots for A: 1, 4, 5? (but 5 might be occupied by something else). Similarly, E must be in 1,3,4? (cannot be in 2 or 5? But 2 is R and E was at 5 and got ""-"", so E is not at 5 but might be at 1,3,4).\n\nAlso, remember that the secret word might have more letters than A and E? But at least A and E are present.\n\nNow, we must avoid C and N.\n\nIdeal next guess: include A and E in positions we haven\'t ruled out, and introduce new letters to test.\n\nLet me try to think of words with R as the second letter, containing A and E, avoiding C and N.\n\nFor example:\n- Position 1: can be a vowel or consonant? We have to put a letter that isn\'t C or N. Ideally, we test other common consonants too.\n\nList some possibilities:\n- The word starts with a letter? Options: beginning with A? Then the word would be A R ... \nExamples: ARISE? But we have E present, and in ""arise"", E is at the end? But in our feedback, E cannot be at position 5? Wait, so if we use ""arise"", E would be at position 5? That was ruled out because in ""crane"" it was at 5 and got ""-"" meaning E is in the word but not at position 5.\n\nTherefore, we cannot put E at position 5 in our next guess? Actually, we can, but from the feedback we know that in the secret word, E isn\'t at position 5? So we don\'t want to put E at 5 in our guess? Actually, we need to try other positions for E.\n\nSimilarly, we know A is not at position 3? So we should not put A at position 3 again? Correct.\n\nSo we need:\n- A not at position 3\n- E not at position 5\n\nIn ""crane"", A was at 3 and got ""-"", E at 5 got ""-"".\n\nSo for our new guess:\n- Position 2 must be R: _ R _ _ _\n- Must include A and E, but:\n    - A: not at position 3? Actually, we can put A at position 1,4, or 5? But position 5 might be used for the E we cannot put there? So let\'s avoid redundancies.\n\nAlso, note that we have only two letters confirmed: one fixed (R at 2) and two floating (A and E).\n\nSo the pattern is: [letter, R, ?, ?, ?] and the word must contain A and E.\n\nWe can try to put:\n- A at position 1: so A R ? ? ? \n- Then E can be at position 3,4? Or position 5? But E cannot be at position 5? Actually, we know that E is not at position 5 in the secret word? So we should avoid putting E at 5? Actually, we can put E at 5 to test? But if we put E at 5, the feedback will be ""-"" again if the secret word does have E but not at 5? But we already know E is in the word? So we don\'t need to retest E? But we don\'t know exactly where E is? So we need to test E in other positions.\n\nIdeally, we should test E in a new position where it hasn\'t been tested? In ""crane"", E was tested only at position 5 and got ""-"". So we should try E in positions 1,3, or 4? Similarly, A was tested only at position 3? So we should try A in positions 1,4, or 5.\n\nBut note: we also want to learn about other letters? So we should use a word that introduces new letters besides the ones we know? Since C and N are ruled out, and R,A,E are in, we need two other letters?\n\nThe word has five letters? We know: one letter R (at position 2), and two letters A and E, and we need to cover two more unknown positions? Plus, we don\'t know if there are duplicates? But generally, assume no duplicates? Unless feedback suggests otherwise? But we haven\'t seen duplicates so far.\n\nSo the secret word must have five distinct letters? Not necessarily? But it could have duplicates? However, in Wordle sometimes words have repeated letters? But let\'s assume we don\'t know? But for strategy, we usually assume distinct until proven otherwise? But here we have to be careful? Actually, the feedback we got: for ""crane"" we have one ✓, two - , and two x? So if letters repeated? We don\'t know? But since C and N are out, and A and E are present? And R is fixed? We should pick a word that introduces two new letters? But also includes A and E and R at 2? Obviously.\n\nHow about a word that starts with a vowel or consonant? Let me brainstorm:\n\nExamples:\n- Starting with A: A R _ _ _\n  - Must include E? Possible words: ARETE? But T might be new? And E at position 4? But also has two E? Moreover, E at position 5? We shouldn\'t put E at 5? In ""ARETE"": positions: A, R, E, T, E? But E at position 3 and 5? \n    - But we know E is not at position 5? So that would cause one E to be at 5? Not good? Also, the feedback ""-"" for E in position 5 might not show duplicates? Actually, the game handle duplicates? But in our case, we need to consider.\n\nBut let me think of simple words: \n- ARISE? But as I thought, in ARISE, E is at position 5? We know E is not at 5? So avoid words ending in E? Or try words with E elsewhere? So E must be in 1,3,4?\n\nSimilarly, A must avoid position 3? So in a 5-letter word with R at 2:\n\nPosition 1: A? Then A R ... and then E? At position 3? That might be okay? Or position 4? \n\nExample word: ARISE? But E at 5? No? \n- How about A R E S ??? No word?\n- Alternatively, words with A at 1 and E at 4: A R ? E ? \nFor example: ARMED? But D is new? And M? But in ARM?ED: check letters: A, R, M, E, D? But we have M? Is that okay?\n\nRemember: N and C are out? So we can include other letters.\n\nAlso, we know E cannot be at 5? So with ARMED: A R M E D? E is at position 4? Which is acceptable? And A is at 1, which is a new position? And E at 4? New position? So let\'s see:\n\nARMED: with positions 1: A, 2: R, 3: M, 4: E, 5: D\n\nBut A was previously at position 3? Now we try at position 1? And E was at position 5? Now we try at position 4? \n\nBut we need to test the unknown? Also, M and D are new letters? So we can get feedback on M and D? And A at 1, E at 4? And R fixed at 2? So this seems reasonable? \n\nHowever, note: we don\'t know if A is at position 1? We are testing it? Similarly, we don\'t know about E at 4? It might be correct? Or wrong? \n\nAnother option: put E at position 1? So E R _ _ _ ...? Then A at? Position 4 or 5? But E is at position 1? \n\nFor example: EXPERT? But E at position 1? And X? But we don\'t know? But EXPERT has E at 1? Then R at 2? But position 2 is R? So E R ...? Words? Like: E R R O R? But repeated R? Or E R A S E? But A at position 4? But we have A and E?\n\nERASE: E, R, A, S, E? Has E at position 1 and 5? But we know E is not at position 5? So avoid? Then ER? Another word: ER? Like ERASE? Or ERUPT? But U? But in ERUPT: E R U P T? Has U,P,T? And no A? But wait, we must include A? Because A is in the secret word? So we must include A in our guess? Otherwise, we won\'t get feedback about A?\n\nImportant: since we know A is in the word? We must include it? Similarly, E is in? So we must include both? That\'s crucial? Because we don\'t know where A and E are? So to get positional feedback? We have to include them?\n\nTherefore, our next guess must contain A, E, and R at position 2? And avoid C and N? And introduce two new letters? And also place A and E in positions that are allowed? Meaning, A not at 3? E not at 5? And we test them in new spots?\n\nSo words: \n- With E at 1? And A at 4? For example: E R A T A? But duplicate A? Let me think of words: something like E R R A? No? \n- E R? Words: ERASE? But E at 1? A at 3? But A must avoid position 3? Because in ""crane"" A was at 3 and got ""-"" meaning not? So we should not put A at 3? So ERASE: positions: E at 1? R at 2? A at 3? Then S? E at 5? But E at 5? We know E cannot be at 5? And A at 3? We know A isn\'t at 3? So ERASE is not suitable? Because putting A at 3 which we know is wrong? And E at 5 which is also wrong? \n\nSo maybe avoid?\n\nThen let\'s think of putting A at position 1? And E at position 4? Like AR?E?: ARM?E? So ARED? Not a word? ARENA? But has N? Which we know is out? So no? ARENA has N? Excluded? \n\nAROSE: or ARISE? But ARISE: A, R, I, S, E? Then E at position 5? Which is forbidden? \n\nAROSE? O? And E? AROSE: A, R, O, S, E? Again E at 5? \n\nHow about A R M E? But need a letter? ARM?E? Words: ARM?E? Like ARMED? Or ARMOR? But no E? And duplicate R? \n\nSo ARMED: A, R, M, E, D? This is valid? \n- Positions: \n  1: A (testing A at first position)\n  2: R (fixed and correct)\n  3: M (new letter? Testing)\n  4: E (testing E at 4? since we know E isn\'t at 5? Position 4 is new?

We are given feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane"" -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Meaning:
- C and N are not in the secret word.
- R is in the correct position (position 2).
- A and E are in the secret word but not in positions 3 and 5 (as per ""crane""), respectively.

Second guess: ""armed"" -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(✓) M(-) E(-) D(-)
Meaning:
- R is again confirmed at position 2 (✓).
- A is in the word (since '-' means present but wrong position), but not at position 1 (because we got '-' for A at position 1).
- Similarly, M, E, and D are all present in the secret word (each gets '-') but not in the positions we guessed: M not at position 3, E not at position 4, D not at position 5.

Important deductions:
From guess 1:
  - A is not at position 3, E is not at position 5.

From guess 2:
  - A is not at position 1 (tried and got '-'). So A must be at position 4 or 5? But we have five positions: 1,2,3,4,5.
  - Position 2 is R, so A must be in position 4 or 5? Why? Because positions: 
    - Position 1: A was tried and not correct? Also, we know A cannot be at 3 (from first guess) and now not at 1? So only positions 4 and 5 left? 
But wait: positions: 1,2,3,4,5? Position 2 is taken by R? And A cannot be at position 3? And now we tried A at position 1? Got '-'? So A must be at position 4 or 5?

Similarly for E:
  - From first guess: E not at position 5? But from second guess: we tried E at position 4? Got '-'? Meaning E is present? But not at position 4? So E cannot be at position 4? And we know from first guess that E cannot be at position 5? So where can E be? Positions: 1,3? But positions: 1,2,3,4,5? We have:
      - Position 2 is R? So E can only be at position 1 or 3? 

Also we have M and D? Which must be present? And not at positions 3 and 5? But we tried M at position 3? Got '-'? So M is not at position 3? Similarly, D tried at position 5? Got '-'? So D not at position 5? 

Moreover, M and D? Since they got '-'? They are in the word? But they could be anywhere else? 

Also? We have A? And E? And the secret word has five letters? We know: R (position 2)? And also A, E, M, D? And no duplicates? We have five distinct letters? Because we haven't had any duplicate feedback? So the secret word must be composed of: R, A, E, M, D? 

But are they all distinct? We have five letters: from feedback: we have A, E, R, M, D? All present? And we have five positions? Therefore, the secret word must contain exactly these five letters: A, E, R, M, D? With R fixed at position 2? 

Now? Positions: Let's list:

Position 1: ? 
Position 2: R (fixed)
Position 3: ?
Position 4: ?
Position 5: ?

Constraints:
- A: cannot be at position 1 (from second guess)? Cannot be at position 3 (from first guess)? So A must be at position 4 or 5?
- E: cannot be at position 4 (from second guess)? Cannot be at position 5 (from first guess)? So E must be at position 1 or 3?
- M: tried at position 3? Got '-'? Meaning M is not at position 3? So M can be at positions 1,4,5? But note? We have other constraints?
- D: tried at position 5? Got '-'? Meaning D is not at position 5? So D can be at positions 1,3,4?

But note: we have to assign the letters to positions? Without conflict?

Also? We may consider? From the feedback? Each '-' means the letter is present but in the wrong position?

So we must assign:

- Position 1: must be E? Or M or D? But E can be at 1 or 3? Similarly? 
- Position 3: must be E? Or M or D? But M cannot be at position 3? From the second feedback? So position 3? Cannot be M? Also position 3? We tried A and got '-' in first guess? So A is also not at position 3? So position 3? Can be E or D? 

Similarly? Position 4? Can be A, M, D? But E cannot be? Position 5? Can be A or M? But D cannot? And E cannot? 

Let me tabulate:

Letters: A, E, M, D? And R fixed?

Positions available:
1: can be E, M, D? (since A is not allowed here? And R is fixed? So E, M, D? But E can be there? M can? D can? But note? We must place E at 1 or 3? So position 1 can be E? Or also M or D? But not A? 

Similarly position 3: can be E or D? Because M cannot be? And A cannot be? 

Position 4: can be A, M, D? 
Position 5: can be A, M? (because D cannot? E cannot? )

But we must assign letters? Without overlapping? 

Consider:

Case: position 1? If we put E? That is possible? Then position 3? Must then be D? (since E is at 1? So position 3: can be D? Only? Because E cannot be at two places? And M cannot be at 3? A cannot? So position 3? Must be D? Then? Position 4 and 5? Must be A and M? 

So? Word: E, R, D, A, M? Or E, R, D, M, A? 

But? Position 4? Could be A or M? And position 5: Could be A or M? 

Check constraints for E: at position 1? Which is allowed? Because E cannot be at 4 or 5? And we tried E at positions? First guess position 5? Second guess position 4? Both wrong? So position 1? We didn't test? So it might be? 

Now? If position 1 is E? Position 2 is R? Position 3 is D? Then position 4 and 5: A and M? 

But? We must avoid? Position? For A? We tried A at positions 1? (wrong)? At position 3? (wrong)? So? A must be at position 4 or 5? So possible? 

Similarly? M? We tried M at position 3? (wrong)? So? If we put M at position 4 or 5? That would be fine? 

But D? In this case? Position 3 is D? We tried D at position 5? (wrong)? So position 3 is allowed? 

So possible words: 
- ERDAM? Is ""ERDAM"" a word? No? 
- What about ER and DAM? Like? E, R, D, A, M -> ""dread"" backwards? But not a word? 
- Or E, R, D, M, A? ""erm...?"" ER?DMA? 

Not English? 

Alternatively? Position 3 is D? Then position 4: A? Position 5: M? -> ERDAM? Not word? 
Or position 4: M? Position 5: A? -> ERDMA? Not word? 

So? That doesn't work? 

Suppose instead? Position 1 is not E? Then position 1 could be M or D? 

But E must be at position 3? (if not at 1) 

Set E at position 3? Then? 

Position 1: can be M or D? 

Because A cannot? And E is at 3? 

Position 3: E? Then? 

Now? M must be somewhere? Cannot be position 3? (tried? But we are putting E? That's okay? M can be? Position 4 or 5? Or position 1? 

Similarly? D? Can be position 1? 4? 

And A? Position 4 or 5? 

Now? Constraints:

Position 1: M? or D? 
Position 3: E? 
Position 4: can be A, M, D? 
Position 5: A or M? 

Also? We know? Position 2: R? 

Case 1: position 1 is M? 
Then word: M, R, E, ?, ? 

Then position 4 and 5? Must be A and D? 
But D cannot be at position 5? So D must be at position 4? Then A at position 5? 
So M R E D A? ""MREDA""? Is that a word? No? 

If position 5? Cannot be D? So? Then? Position 4 must be A? Then position 5 must be? But we have only A and D? Then? Position 4: A? Position 5: D? But D cannot be at position 5? Because we tried D at position 5? And got '-'? Meaning it is in the word? But not at position 5? So D cannot be at position 5? Therefore? Position 5 cannot be D? So position 5 must be A? Then position 4? D? But that puts D at position 4? And A at position 5? 

So? ""MR E D A""? Wait? M, R, E, D, A? ""mared""? Mared? Not common? But? Mared is a word? According to dictionary? It means cried? Like mar with suffix? Uncommon? 

Alternatively: position 1? Instead of M? Place D? 

So? Position 1: D? Then word: D, R, E, ?, ? 

Then position 4 and 5: must be A and M? 
Position 5? Cannot be D? Which is not? A or M? So we put? Position 4: A? Position 5: M? -> D R E A M? ""DREAM"" 
Or position 4: M? Position 5: A? -> D R E M A? ""Drema""? Not a word? 

So ""dream"" is a word: D, R, E, A, M? 

Now? Check constraints:

Position 1: D? We tried D at position 5? So testing at position 1? 
Position 3: E? We know E was tried at position 5? Got '-'? Then tried at position 4? Got '-'? So testing at position 3? 
Position 4: A? We tried A at positions 1 and 3? Failed? Then testing at position 4? 
Position 5: M? We tried M at position 3? Failed? So testing at position 5? 

Does that satisfy?

Letter constraints:
- A? Position 4? Which is different than position 3 and 1 we tried? 
- E? Position 3? Different than position 4 and 5 we tried? 
- M? Position 5? Previously at position 3? Wrong? 
- D? Position 1? Previously at position 5? Wrong? 
- R? At position 2? Correct? 

Now? The word ""dream""? 

But let me confirm? 

Also? We have no other constraints? 

Moreover? Are there other possibilities? We have E must be at position 3? If not? Then? Position 1 was E? Didn't form word? 

So? Only candidate? ""dream""? 

Therefore? I guess ""dream"". 

But? What about the other assignment? With E at position 1? We didn't find a word? So? 

Hence? Let's propose? 

In the feedback? We have five letters: A, E, M, D? And R? So must? 

Therefore? New guess should be ""dream"". 

But? We could guess other words? But? We have limited tries? 

But? We found a valid word? 

So? 

Answer: dream? 

But? What if? We didn't have dream? 

Alternatively: another word? Wait? E must be at position 1 or 3? 

If E at position 3? Then? Another possibility? Position 1? Not M? But D? And then position 4? A? Position 5? M: ""dream"" 

Or position 4? M? Position 5? A?: not a word? 

So? 

Therefore? I think dream is the only common word? 

So? I'll go with dream. 

But? Check?

### Previous Feedback Analysis:
- **Guess 1: crane → C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(-)**  
  - R is in the correct position (position 2).  
  - A and E are in the word but not at positions 3 and 5, respectively.  
  - C and N are absent.  

- **Guess 2: armed → A(-) R(✓) M(-) E(-) D(-)**  
  - R remains confirmed at position 2 (✓).  
  - A is present but not at position 1 (new information from this guess).  
  - M, E, and D are present but not at positions 3, 4, or 5, respectively.  
  - E is confirmed absent at position 4 (new information).  

### Key Deductions:
1. **Confirmed Letters**: A, E, M, D, and R (position 2) are in the secret word.  
2. **Position Constraints**:  
   - A: Cannot be at positions 1 (from ""armed""), 3 (from ""crane""), so must be at position 4 or 5.  
   - E: Cannot be at positions 4 (from ""armed""), 5 (from ""crane""), so must be at position 1 or 3.  
   - M: Cannot be at position 3 (from ""armed""), so must be at 1, 4, or 5.  
   - D: Cannot be at position 5 (from ""armed""), so must be at 1, 3, or 4.  
   - R: Fixed at position 2.  
3. **Letter Pool**: The secret word consists of exactly A, E, M, D, and R (5 distinct letters).  

### Word Construction:
- E must be at position 1 or 3:  
  - If E is at position 3:  
    - Position 1 must be M or D (since A is ruled out).  
    - Position 4 must be A or M/D (to avoid conflicts).  
    - Position 5 must be A or M (D is ruled out).  
    - Possible words:  
      - **DREAM**: D at 1, R at 2, E at 3, A at 4, M at 5.  
        - Checks:  
          - A at 4 (valid, avoids positions 1/3).  
          - E at 3 (valid, avoids 4/5).  
          - M at 5 (valid, avoids position 3).  
          - D at 1 (valid, avoids position 5).  
        - ""Dream"" is a valid English word.  
      - Other combinations (e.g., M R E A D → ""mread,"" not a word) are invalid.  
  - If E is at position 1:  
    - Position 3 must be D (only option left), and positions 4/5 must be A/M.  
    - No valid English words formed (e.g., ERDAM, ERDMA).  
- **Conclusion**: ""dream"" is the only viable solution fitting all constraints.  

### Next Guess:
- **Purpose**: Test ""dream"" to resolve the puzzle based on the above logic.  
- Expected feedback patterns will confirm or refine the solution in subsequent guesses.

   - M: Cannot be at position 3 (from ""armed""), so must be at 1, 4, or 5.  
   - D: Cannot be at position 5 (from ""armed""), so must be at 1, 3, or 4.  
   - R: Fixed at position 2.  
3. **Letter Pool**: The secret word consists of exactly A, E, M, D, and R (5 distinct letters).  

### Word Construction:
- E must be at position 1 or 3:  
  - If E is at position 3:  
    - Position 1 must be M or D (since A is ruled out).  
    - Position 4 must be A or M/D (to avoid conflicts).  
    - Position 5 must be A or M (D is ruled out).  
    - Possible words:  
      - **DREAM**: D at 1, R at 2, E at 3, A at 4, M at 5.  
        - Checks:  
          - A at 4 (valid, avoids positions 1/3).  
          - E at 3 (valid, avoids 4/5).  
          - M at 5 (valid, avoids position 3).  
          - D at 1 (valid, avoids position 5).  
        - ""Dream"" is a valid English word.  
      - Other combinations (e.g., M R E A D → ""mread,"" not a word) are invalid.  
  - If E is at position 1:  
    - Position 3 must be D (only option left), and positions 4/5 must be A/M.  
    - No valid English words formed (e.g., ERDAM, ERDMA).  
- **Conclusion**: ""dream"" is the only viable solution fitting all constraints.  

### Next Guess:
- **Purpose**: Test ""dream"" to resolve the puzzle based on the above logic.  
- Expected feedback patterns will confirm or refine the solution in subsequent guesses.",Guess 3: dream -> FEEDBACK: D(✓) R(✓) E(✓) A(✓) M(✓),SUCCESS
