We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and no repeating letters to maximize information.
 Common letters in 5-letter words: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.

 I recall that words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ROAST"", ""RAISE"" are often recommended.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common and distinct.

We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" → C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(✓), E(x)
 This means:
   - R is in the word and in the correct position (2nd letter).
   - N is in the word and in the correct position (4th letter).
   - C, A, E are not in the word at all.

 So the secret word has:
   - 2nd letter: R
   - 4th letter: N
   - Does not contain C, A, E

 Also, note that the word must be 5 letters.

 We know:
   Position 1: ? (but cannot be C, and we know A and E are also out)
   Position 2: R
   Position 3: ?
   Position 4: N
   Position 5: ? (cannot be E, and also not A or C)

 Now, we need to guess a word that fits constraints and helps us find other letters.

 We should avoid using C, A, E in any position.

 Common letters to try: Let's include other vowels (if any) such as I, O, U, and other common consonants.

 We know the word has R in position 2 and N in position 4.

 Possible patterns: _ R _ N _

 Let me think of words that fit this pattern without C, A, E.

 Example words: 
   IRONY, IRONS, URINE, BRINK, etc.

 However, we must also consider that the first guess had A in position 3 which was wrong and not in the word, so position 3 is not A.

 Since our goal is to gain maximum information, we can try a word that has letters we haven't tried yet.

 Letters we know: R and N are in the word (with positions known). We eliminated C, A, E.

 So, let's include some other common letters: B, D, I, O, P, T, S, L, etc.

 We can try a word like ""PRINT"": 
   P at position 1, R at 2, I at 3, N at 4, T at 5.

 But check: we haven't used I, T, P before. This would test P, I, T.

 However, note the feedback for ""crane"": the A was at position 3 and it was absent, so we know position 3 is not A and also not any of the other absent letters? Actually, we only know that the letter in position 3 in ""crane"" was A, and since A is not in the word at all, we can rule out A entirely.

 Also, note that the word does not have A, so positions 1,3,5 cannot be A.

 Let's think about ""print"": 
   Pattern: P R I N T.
   We know position 2 is R (correct) and position 4 is N (correct). So if ""print"" is the word, we would get: P(?), I(?), T(?).

 But we are testing new letters.

 Alternatively, we could try ""bring"": 
   B R I N G -> but note ""g"" is a new letter? And we have B, I, G to test.

 However, we must make sure that the word does not contain A, E, or C.

 Another idea: we have two letters fixed: R in 2 and N in 4. We can try to use common letters in positions 1, 3, 5 that aren't A, E, C.

 Let's list possible words:
   BRINY, BRINK, BRINY, BRING (but we don't know if G is present), TRIPN? Wait, TRIPN isn't a word.

 Common words: 
   URINE: U R I N E -> but E is excluded? We know E is not in the word, so we cannot use E. So URINE has an E -> not allowed.

   ORNIS - not a word.

   Consider: 
      Position 1: can be B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, R (but R is used in position2? Not necessarily, but we avoid reuse? The rules don't say anything about repeated letters? Actually, feedback rules: if a letter appears more than once, then feedback might be tricky.

   But note: in ""crane"", we had distinct letters so we don't know if the secret word has duplicates. So we must consider duplicates possible.

   However, since we know R is present only once? Actually, we don't know. The feedback for R: we had R in position2 and it was correct, but if there were another R, we would see it? 

   In the feedback: R was only marked for position2? And we didn't have another R? So if there was another R, then we didn't test it. Therefore, the secret word might have duplicate letters. But with ""crane"" we only had one R.

   Since we are early in the game, let's avoid duplicating letters for now to maximize new information.

   So, for the second guess, let's choose a word that:
      - Has R in position 2 and N in position 4 (so that we confirm and build on known positions).
      - Uses letters we haven't tried: so exclude C, A, E.
      - Does not reuse R and N elsewhere? Because we don't know if duplicates exist? But actually, we are placing R and N in the known positions. For other positions, we can use new letters.

   However, if we reuse a letter that we know is in the word (like R or N) in a different position, the feedback might show ""-"" meaning it's in the wrong position. Which is useful information.

   But since R is already known to be in position 2, if we put it again in position 1, then:
        If the secret word has only one R, then position1 would be marked wrong (if we put R) because the R is fixed at position2? Actually, the feedback marks each occurrence independently? 

   Let me recall: In Wordle rules, if a letter appears once in the word and you guess two, then one can be marked and the other might be x? Specifically: 
      - If a letter is in the word exactly once and you guess it twice: one instance might be correctly placed, then the other is not present, so gets an x? 

   For example: secret is ROBOT, and you guess ROOMY: first O is ✓ (in position2) and second O is x because secret has only one O? 

   But in our case, we are not sure if duplicates exist. So let's avoid duplicating R and N for now? Because we don't know.

   Alternatively, we can test: we can put a letter we already know in a new position? For example, put an N again? But we know N is in position4, so if we put N again in position1, then if N is duplicated, we will get ""-"" for position1, else x.

   But for a second guess, we might want to test entirely new letters to get more information about other letters.

   Let's proceed to choose a word with:
        Position1: new letter
        Position3: new letter
        Position5: new letter

   And we know positions 2 and 4: R and N.

   Example: PRINT
        P (new), R (known), I (new), N (known), T (new)

   This tests P, I, T. If T is in the word, we get T(-) if it's in the word but not at position5? Or ✓ if it is.

   Alternatively, consider ""ORIGN"" - invalid word.

   Another word: ""DRINK"" -> D R I N K -> tests D, I, K.

   But note: we don't know if D, I, K are in the word.

   Also, note: ""crane"" had A at position3 and it was absent? Then we avoid that? So position3 cannot be A? We already know A is absent.

   Let me check common words: 
      PRINT, DRINK, BRING (but G might be new), BRINK, TRINK? Not valid.

   Valid: PRINT, DRINK, BRINE (but E is excluded -> so discard BRINE), BRINK, BRINY.

   Since E is excluded, using BRINE is bad.

   Let me choose ""BRINK"": 
      B R I N K

   Reasons:
      - B, I, K are new letters.
      - We have R at 2, N at 4.

   Alternatively, I could choose ""PRINT"" or ""DRINK"". I'll go with ""drink"" because D is a common consonant.

   But ""drink"" has D at start, R at 2, I at 3, N at 4, K at 5.

   Let's see: D, I, K are new. 

   Also, note: we are testing position3: I. If the secret word has an I, but not at position3? Then we get ""-"", and so on.

   Another option: ""horny"" -> H R O N Y? But position4 is N? Correct? And we avoid E/C/A? But ""horny"" is a word? Maybe, but let's stick to common ones.

   Since we are in a programming context, perhaps common words are better. I'll pick ""drink"".

   Guess: drink

   But wait: in the first guess we had N at position4 and it was correct. We are putting N at position4 again? Then we expect ✓. Also we are testing the other positions.

   Or consider ""wring"": W R I N G -> G is new? This also tests W, I, G.

   However, W is less common? I think ""drink"" is fine.

   Let me choose ""print"" to test P, I, T.

   I'll go with PRINT.

   Let me confirm: ""print"" is a valid word.

   So, our second guess: PRINT

   We hope to get feedback on P, I, T.

   Pattern: P R I N T

   We know: R(✓ at position2), N(✓ at position4) - so we expect at least two ✓s.

   Feedback will tell us:
      Position1: P → if ✓, then P is present and in position1? Otherwise, if P is present but not at position1? Then -, else x.
      Position3: I → similarly?
      Position5: T → similarly?

   So that will give information on P, I, T.

   We also note: the secret word does not have A, C, E.

   So, let's guess ""print"".
</think>
After the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- R is confirmed in the correct position (position 2).
- N is confirmed in the correct position (position 4).
- C, A, and E are confirmed absent from the secret word.

For the second guess:
- The word must include R at position 2 and N at position 4.
- It should avoid C, A, and E entirely.
- We prioritize maximizing information by testing new common letters (e.g., P, I, T) in unfamiliar positions.

The word ""print"" fits these criteria:
- Positions: P (1), R (2), I (3), N (4), T (5).
- Tests P, I, and T as they haven't been tried before.
- Builds on known positions R (2) and N (4) which are expected to be correct again.
- Avoids eliminated letters C, A, E.

<guess>print</guess>",print,"We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" → C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(✓), E(x)
 This means:
   - R is in the word and in the correct position (2nd letter).

   - C, A, E are not in the word at all.

 So the secret word has:
   - 2nd letter: R
   - 4th letter: N
   - Does not contain C, A, E

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and no repeating letters to maximize information.
 Common letters in 5-letter words: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.

 I recall that words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ROAST"", ""RAISE"" are often recommended.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common and distinct.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" → C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(✓), E(x)
 This means:
   - R is in the word and in the correct position (2nd letter).
   - N is in the word and in the correct position (4th letter).
   - C, A, E are not in the word at all.

 So the secret word has:
   - 2nd letter: R
   - 4th letter: N
   - Does not contain C, A, E

 Also, note that the word must be 5 letters.

 We know:
   Position 1: ? (but cannot be C, and we know A and E are also out)
   Position 2: R
   Position 3: ?
   Position 4: N
   Position 5: ? (cannot be E, and also not A or C)

 Now, we need to guess a word that fits constraints and helps us find other letters.

 We should avoid using C, A, E in any position.

 Common letters to try: Let's include other vowels (if any) such as I, O, U, and other common consonants.

 We know the word has R in position 2 and N in position 4.

 Possible patterns: _ R _ N _

 Let me think of words that fit this pattern without C, A, E.

 Example words: 
   IRONY, IRONS, URINE, BRINK, etc.

 However, we must also consider that the first guess had A in position 3 which was wrong and not in the word, so position 3 is not A.

 Since our goal is to gain maximum information, we can try a word that has letters we haven't tried yet.

 Letters we know: R and N are in the word (with positions known). We eliminated C, A, E.

 So, let's include some other common letters: B, D, I, O, P, T, S, L, etc.

 We can try a word like ""PRINT"": 
   P at position 1, R at 2, I at 3, N at 4, T at 5.

 But check: we haven't used I, T, P before. This would test P, I, T.

 However, note the feedback for ""crane"": the A was at position 3 and it was absent, so we know position 3 is not A and also not any of the other absent letters? Actually, we only know that the letter in position 3 in ""crane"" was A, and since A is not in the word at all, we can rule out A entirely.

 Also, note that the word does not have A, so positions 1,3,5 cannot be A.

 Let's think about ""print"": 
   Pattern: P R I N T.
   We know position 2 is R (correct) and position 4 is N (correct). So if ""print"" is the word, we would get: P(?), I(?), T(?).

 But we are testing new letters.

 Alternatively, we could try ""bring"": 
   B R I N G -> but note ""g"" is a new letter? And we have B, I, G to test.

 However, we must make sure that the word does not contain A, E, or C.

 Another idea: we have two letters fixed: R in 2 and N in 4. We can try to use common letters in positions 1, 3, 5 that aren't A, E, C.

 Let's list possible words:
   BRINY, BRINK, BRINY, BRING (but we don't know if G is present), TRIPN? Wait, TRIPN isn't a word.

 Common words: 
   URINE: U R I N E -> but E is excluded? We know E is not in the word, so we cannot use E. So URINE has an E -> not allowed.

   ORNIS - not a word.

   Consider: 
      Position 1: can be B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, R (but R is used in position2? Not necessarily, but we avoid reuse? The rules don't say anything about repeated letters? Actually, feedback rules: if a letter appears more than once, then feedback might be tricky.

   But note: in ""crane"", we had distinct letters so we don't know if the secret word has duplicates. So we must consider duplicates possible.

   However, since we know R is present only once? Actually, we don't know. The feedback for R: we had R in position2 and it was correct, but if there were another R, we would see it? 

   In the feedback: R was only marked for position2? And we didn't have another R? So if there was another R, then we didn't test it. Therefore, the secret word might have duplicate letters. But with ""crane"" we only had one R.

   Since we are early in the game, let's avoid duplicating letters for now to maximize new information.

   So, for the second guess, let's choose a word that:
      - Has R in position 2 and N in position 4 (so that we confirm and build on known positions).
      - Uses letters we haven't tried: so exclude C, A, E.
      - Does not reuse R and N elsewhere? Because we don't know if duplicates exist? But actually, we are placing R and N in the known positions. For other positions, we can use new letters.

   However, if we reuse a letter that we know is in the word (like R or N) in a different position, the feedback might show ""-"" meaning it's in the wrong position. Which is useful information.

   But since R is already known to be in position 2, if we put it again in position 1, then:
        If the secret word has only one R, then position1 would be marked wrong (if we put R) because the R is fixed at position2? Actually, the feedback marks each occurrence independently? 

   Let me recall: In Wordle rules, if a letter appears once in the word and you guess two, then one can be marked and the other might be x? Specifically: 
      - If a letter is in the word exactly once and you guess it twice: one instance might be correctly placed, then the other is not present, so gets an x? 

   For example: secret is ROBOT, and you guess ROOMY: first O is ✓ (in position2) and second O is x because secret has only one O? 

   But in our case, we are not sure if duplicates exist. So let's avoid duplicating R and N for now? Because we don't know.

   Alternatively, we can test: we can put a letter we already know in a new position? For example, put an N again? But we know N is in position4, so if we put N again in position1, then if N is duplicated, we will get ""-"" for position1, else x.

   But for a second guess, we might want to test entirely new letters to get more information about other letters.

   Let's proceed to choose a word with:
        Position1: new letter
        Position3: new letter
        Position5: new letter

   And we know positions 2 and 4: R and N.

   Example: PRINT
        P (new), R (known), I (new), N (known), T (new)

   This tests P, I, T. If T is in the word, we get T(-) if it's in the word but not at position5? Or ✓ if it is.

   Alternatively, consider ""ORIGN"" - invalid word.

   Another word: ""DRINK"" -> D R I N K -> tests D, I, K.

   But note: we don't know if D, I, K are in the word.

   Also, note: ""crane"" had A at position3 and it was absent? Then we avoid that? So position3 cannot be A? We already know A is absent.

   Let me check common words: 
      PRINT, DRINK, BRING (but G might be new), BRINK, TRINK? Not valid.

   Valid: PRINT, DRINK, BRINE (but E is excluded -> so discard BRINE), BRINK, BRINY.

   Since E is excluded, using BRINE is bad.

   Let me choose ""BRINK"": 
      B R I N K

   Reasons:
      - B, I, K are new letters.
      - We have R at 2, N at 4.

   Alternatively, I could choose ""PRINT"" or ""DRINK"". I'll go with ""drink"" because D is a common consonant.

   But ""drink"" has D at start, R at 2, I at 3, N at 4, K at 5.

   Let's see: D, I, K are new. 

   Also, note: we are testing position3: I. If the secret word has an I, but not at position3? Then we get ""-"", and so on.

   Another option: ""horny"" -> H R O N Y? But position4 is N? Correct? And we avoid E/C/A? But ""horny"" is a word? Maybe, but let's stick to common ones.

   Since we are in a programming context, perhaps common words are better. I'll pick ""drink"".

   Guess: drink

   But wait: in the first guess we had N at position4 and it was correct. We are putting N at position4 again? Then we expect ✓. Also we are testing the other positions.

   Or consider ""wring"": W R I N G -> G is new? This also tests W, I, G.

   However, W is less common? I think ""drink"" is fine.

   Let me choose ""print"" to test P, I, T.

   I'll go with PRINT.

   Let me confirm: ""print"" is a valid word.

   So, our second guess: PRINT

   We hope to get feedback on P, I, T.

   Pattern: P R I N T

   We know: R(✓ at position2), N(✓ at position4) - so we expect at least two ✓s.

   Feedback will tell us:
      Position1: P → if ✓, then P is present and in position1? Otherwise, if P is present but not at position1? Then -, else x.
      Position3: I → similarly?
      Position5: T → similarly?

   So that will give information on P, I, T.

   We also note: the secret word does not have A, C, E.

   So, let's guess ""print"".After the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- R is confirmed in the correct position (position 2).
- N is confirmed in the correct position (position 4).
- C, A, and E are confirmed absent from the secret word.

For the second guess:
- The word must include R at position 2 and N at position 4.
- It should avoid C, A, and E entirely.
- We prioritize maximizing information by testing new common letters (e.g., P, I, T) in unfamiliar positions.

The word ""print"" fits these criteria:
- Positions: P (1), R (2), I (3), N (4), T (5).
- Tests P, I, and T as they haven't been tried before.
- Builds on known positions R (2) and N (4) which are expected to be correct again.
- Avoids eliminated letters C, A, E.

We have feedback from two guesses:

**First Guess: crane**
- C(x) -> C is not in the word
- R(✓) -> R is in the word and in position 2
- A(x) -> A is not in the word
- N(✓) -> N is in the word and in position 4
- E(x) -> E is not in the word

So from guess 1, we know:
- The word has R in position 2 and N in position 4.
- The letters C, A, E are not in the word.

**Second Guess: print**
- P(x) -> P is not in the word
- R(✓) -> R is in position 2 (we already knew this)
- I(-) -> I is in the word but NOT in position 3
- N(✓) -> N is in position 4 (we already knew this)
- T(x) -> T is not in the word

New information:
- I is in the word, but not at position 3.
- P and T are not in the word.

So now, we know:
- Letters in the word: R (position 2), N (position 4), and I (somewhere except position 3).
- Letters NOT in the word: C, A, E, P, T.

The secret word pattern: _ R _ N _
- Position 1: unknown, cannot be C,A,E,P,T (or the other eliminated letters)
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: unknown, cannot be I (because we have I(-) at position 3) and cannot be C,A,E,P,T
- Position 4: N
- Position 5: unknown, cannot be C,A,E,P,T

I is present in the word but not at position 3. Therefore, I can be at position 1, 5, or maybe even position 3? Wait, no: the feedback for I is that it is in the word but not at position 3 (marked as ""-""), so it cannot be at position 3. So position 3 is definitely not I.

Possible positions for I: 1 or 5? But note the pattern is _ R _ N _, so positions 1, 3, 5 are available (but 3 is excluded for I). Also, note that position 3 can be some letter that hasn't been tried? And similarly for 1 and 5.

We must form a word that:
- Has R at position 2, N at position 4.
- Contains the letter I (but not at position 3).
- Does not contain C, A, E, P, T.

We have used letters: C,R,A,N,E in first guess and P,R,I,N,T in second. So we have not tested: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,O,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. But Q,X,Z are less common.

Common letters we might try: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,O,S,U,W,Y.

We must form a valid word with pattern _ R _ N _ 

Also, we know I appears somewhere, but not in position 3. So the I must be at position 1 or 5? Because position 2 and 4 are R and N and fixed. But if we consider duplicate letters? We don't know, but perhaps avoid duplicates for now.

So, the word must have I either at position 1 or position 5.

Possible words:
- Option 1: Position 1: I -> pattern I R _ N _
  - Then position 3 and 5 need to be filled. But note: position 3 cannot be I (already placed at pos1) and we avoid duplicates? If the word has two I's, that would be okay? But for efficiency, let's assume no duplicates until proven otherwise.
  - Words: IRON? -> wait, IRON is four letters? No, IRONS? But IRONS has S at the end? IRONS is 5 letters? I-R-O-N-S.
  - Consider: IRONS -> I R O N S -> but this has O at position 3? Yes.
  - Another possibility: IRK? -> too short. I R I N something? Two I's: if allowed? But not efficient? We haven't been forced to consider duplicates.

- Option 2: Position 5: I -> pattern _ R _ N I
  - Then: words like ?? R? N I -> examples: CAR?N?I -> no A/C. URN?I? -> URN is three letters? What about BRINY? B R I N Y -> but that has I in position 3? But we cannot have I in position 3? Here we put I at position 5? So pattern _ R _ N I -> example: C R A N I -> but A and C are excluded. 
  - Words: URN?I isn't a 5-letter word? Examples: ORDNI? Not a word. GU?NI? Not valid? 
  - Known words: HOR?I -> H O R N I -> but HORN? HORNS? HORNS has S? No: HORNS has N at position 4? Pattern must have N at position 4? H O R N S -> but we need the fifth letter to be I? Then it would be HORNI? Not valid. 
  - Alternative: G R O N I -> isn't a word. 
  - More: B R O N I -> BROWN? No, BROWN is B R O W N? Pattern B R O W N -> which is 5 letters? But W in position 4? Wrong? We require N at position 4. 

Wait, let me think differently: common words ending in I? 

Actually, the pattern must be: 
  position1: ? (letter not C,A,E,P,T)
  position2: R
  position3: ? (not I, and not C,A,E,P,T)
  position4: N
  position5: I? -> then what words? 

Words ending with NI: 
  SUN?I? Not SUNNI? SUNNI is a word? It means... but let's check: S U N N I -> wait, that's 5? S U N I? Not 5 letters? SUNNI? SUNN?I? Perhaps: 
UNION? But U N I O N -> pattern doesn't match? We require position2=R? Not R? Doesn't match.

Let me list possible words with the pattern _ R _ N _ and containing I.

First, if I is at position 1: words starting with IR?N? -> examples: 
  IRONY: I R O N Y -> positions: I(1), R(2), O(3), N(4), Y(5). 
  Check: O and Y are not excluded? And I at position1? Then position3 is O? We haven't tested O? And position5 is Y? 
  Also, IRONS? I R O N S -> O at position3? S at position5? 
  But we cannot have I at position3? That is satisfied.

Second, if I is at position 5: words ending with ...N?I? That would be ...N I? But we need R?N?I? Pattern: _ R _ N I -> positions: pos1: ?, pos3: ?. 
  Words: 
      UR?NI -> are there words? U R B N I? URBAN? No. 
      OR?NI -> ORGAN? -> O R G A N? A excluded? And N is position5? But pattern must N at4? ORGAN is O R G A N -> positions: O(1), R(2), G(3), A(4) -> but we require N at position4? So no? 
      Must have N at position4? So the pattern ? R ? N I? 
      Examples: GRENI? -> not a valid word? 
      DRUNI? Not valid? 
      BRAND? But A excluded? 
  Actually, I cannot recall any common 5-letter word ending in NI? So maybe low probability? 

Given that, it seems more likely that I is at position 1? But wait, what about position 3? We know position3 cannot be I? But what if we put I at position1? Then the word becomes IRON? something? 

But wait, there might be words with I at a different position? For example, if the word has two letters? But we haven't eliminated the possibility? 

Alternatively, note that the feedback for ""print"" has I(-) meaning I is in the word but not at position3? It does not say where it is? It could be anywhere else? So including position1 or 5? Also note: position2 is R? Position4 is N? So the other spots: 1,3,5? But position3 cannot be I? Therefore, I must be at position1 or position5? 

But if we cannot find a word with I at position5? Then we look at position1? 

So let's consider IRONY: 
  I R O N Y -> 
  Suppose the secret word is IRONY? 
  Then feedback for ""print"": 
      P vs I? -> P is absent? ✓ we got x -> correct? 
      R vs R? ✓
      I vs O? -> I is present? Because the word has I at position1? Then it should give I(-) for print? Because position3 of ""print"" had I? But the actual I is at position1? So we get ""-"" for I? Which matches? 
      N vs N? ✓
      T vs Y? -> T is absent? ✓ we got x.

So it matches feedback? But maybe it's the word? So we could guess it? 

But we need to test? 

Alternative: BRIN? -> BRINE? But E excluded? BRINY? B R I N Y -> but then I is at position3? That would be problem? Position3 cannot be I? Because we have I(-) at position3? So BRINY would be: B R I N Y -> I at position3? Then if BRINY is the word, then we should have feedback for ""print"" at position3: I vs secret? Position3: I vs I? Then it should be ✓? But we got I(-) which means wrong position? So contradiction? 

Therefore, BRINY is impossible? Because it would put I at position3? 

Similarly, any word with I at position3 would have given I(✓) in ""print""? But we didn't? So no word has I at position3? 

Therefore, I must be at position1 or position5? 

We saw IRONY? What about IRONS? 
  IRONS: I R O N S -> contains I at position1? 

If we guess IRONS? Then:
  We are testing O and S? 

But maybe we want to test the possibility of I at position1? Or what if we want to test for position5? 

But note: we also need to fill position3? Position3 must be a letter that hasn't been eliminated? 

We have eliminated: C,A,E,P,T? And we know the word has I? Then? 

Possible words:
  If I at 1: 
      IRONY: I R O N Y -> O and Y are untested?
      IRONS: I R O N S -> O and S? 
      I R I N * -> but then two I? If allowed? Example: IRING? Not valid? IRINS? Not sure? 

  If I at 5: 
      ? R ? N I -> 
      FR?NI? Like FRENI? Not valid? 
      GR?NI? GRUNI? Not valid.
      DR?NI? Not common? 
      Only a few: 
      UR in the beginning? Urban not matching? 
      Maybe WR?NI? WRING? WRING? W R I N G -> but W R I N G? Then I is in position3? That would be a problem? Pattern: W R I N G -> position3=I? Then same as BRINY? 

Actually, WR?NI? If we require position5=I? Then WRING becomes W R I N I? But that has I at position3? And 5? Then if we guess ""print""? We will have I at position3? But that would give I(✓) if the secret has I at position3? But we have I(-) so position3 is not I? So WRING? It has I at position3? So invalid? 

Therefore, words that have I at position3 cannot be? 

But what about words with I at position1? 

Other words? 
  IR?N? with new letters: IRISH? 5 letters? I R I S H -> but pattern? Position4:N? No? IRISH is I R I S H -> position4 is S? Then not matching? We require position4=N? 

  Only words that match _ R _ N _ and have N at position4? 

So words like: ? R ? N ? 

Common words: 
  BRAWN? But A excluded? 
  BROWN? O at position3? Position4 is W? No? BROWN is B R O W N -> positions: B(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5)? But we require N at position4? Then no? 
  CROWN? C excluded? 
  GROUP? No N? 
  GRAND? A excluded? 
  GRO?N? GROAN? No, A excluded? 

Given the constraints? Let me think of words: 
  IRONY: I R O N Y -> fits? 
  DRO?N? No? 

Another word: URINE? But U R I N E -> E? Excluded? Not allowed? 

FORUM? Doesn't have N? 
BRING? B R I N G -> I is at position3? Forbidden? 

HORNY? H R O N Y -> positions: H(1), R(2), O(3), N(4), Y(5)? Then I? Where is the I? We need to have I? But HORNY doesn't have I? But the word has I? Because we got feedback at guess2: I(-) meaning I is in the word? But HORNY has no I? So it cannot be? 

So only words with I? And pattern? 

Therefore? Either:
  The word must have I at position1? Then we have words like: 
      IRONY (using O and Y)
      IRONS (using O and S)

Or? At position5? And I cannot recall? So maybe position1 is more likely? 

So? We can choose between IRONY and IRONS? But note: we don't know if O is in the word? 

We could make a guess that tests O at position3? Because both IRONY and IRONS have O at position3? 

But if we guess IRONY? Then if O is correct? And Y? Or if we guess IRONS? 

But we can get information? 

Alternatively? Maybe we guess a word that tests multiple possibilities? 

But with only 6 tries? 

Also? Since position3 is crucial? We can choose a word that tests a new letter at position3? 

Remember? Position3 cannot be I? And can not be C,A,E,P,T? 

We have not tested: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,O,S,U,W,Y? etc? 

We guess? 
  Position1: B? Or? 
  Position3: O? 

But we know I must be somewhere? 

We have two main possibilities: I at position1 or position5? 

Case 1: I at position1? Then the word starts with I? Pattern: I R ? N ? 

Case 2: I at position5? Pattern: ? R ? N I? 

We don't have enough information to distinguish? So let's test the letter O at position3? 

For example? Guess a word like: GRO?N? GROAN? But A excluded?

We need a word that has:
  Position2=R, Position4=N? But if I at position1? Then we cannot? 

Alternatively? Design a guess to test I at position1? 

Let me try: if we guess ""irony""? Then:
  If irony is the word? We win? 
  Otherwise? The feedback tells us:

But if we guess IRONY? Then? 

Or we could guess a word that has I? But not necessarily at position1? But we have to put I somewhere? 

But note? The word has R?N? And I? 

So? Let me choose to test position1 for I? 

Specifically? We can guess IRONY.

If IRONY is the word? Then we solve it? 

If not? We might get feedback? For example, if I is in the word? Then we might know? 

But? Suppose we guess IRONY? And it is not the word? Then feedback might be:

If the secret word has I at position1? Then we get I(✓)? And if O at position3? Then O(?) and Y(?) etc.? 

Alternatively? We could try a word that has I at position5? But? We don't know one? 

So? Either? There is no word with I at position5? Or we haven't found it? 

But? Maybe? DRUNK? But K? And no I? 

I think for now? We focus on words that start with I? 

Also? Consider the possibility that position1 is I? Then position3 and position5 are open? 

We saw IRONY and IRONS? 

What about other words? 

IRK? Not long enough? 

I R B N? Not found? 

A valid word list? 

In the context? Perhaps? Also: BRI? but with I at end? Not pattern? 

Another thought: the word could be GRIND? G R I N D? But then I at position3? That is disallowed? Because ""print"" had I at position3? and got marked as '-'? Then if it were at position3? It should be marked correctly? But we got wrong position? So? No? 

Therefore? We focus on I at position1? 

Now? Which to choose: IRONY or IRONS? 

We have used: C,R,A,N,E,P,R,I,N,T? 

In IRONY? We test O and Y? 

In IRONS? We test O and S? 

S is more common? 

We might want to test? 

But? Maybe? We guess IRONS? Because S might be common? 

But? Alternatively: since we don't know? 

I choose: IRONY? For the guess? Because it tests O and Y? And if not the answer? We get feedback about O and Y? 

But if we guess IRONY? And the word is IRONS? Then we will have:

Feedback for IRONY? 

Suppose secret? IRONS? Then:
  I vs I? ✓
  R vs R? ✓
  O vs O? But position3: O vs O? Then ✓? Because we got ✓? 
  Then? Then N vs N? ✓? 
  Y vs S? If Y? Then? Not present? So? 

But wait? Secret? IRONS? Guess? IRONY? 

Position1: I=✓? 
Position2: R=✓? 
Position3: O=✓? Because secret? O is at position3? 
Position4: N=✓? 
Position5: Y? Secret? S? So? S? Y is not in the word? So? Y(x)? 

But we do not know? We get feedback? 

Similarly? If we guess IRONY? And the secret is another word? 

But? What? Other words? 

What about: CRON? Not valid? 

So? Since IRONY and IRONS are both possible? And they are very similar? 

Alternatively? We might test? But? We don't have a guess that covers both? 

Because IRONY uses Y? And IRONS uses S? 

We might choose: ""ironB""? Not? 

So? I choose? To guess IRONY? 

So? Let's guess ""IRONY"".

And if it's not? We have feedback? 

But note? If IRONY is guessed? And it's not the word? Then:
- If I? ✓? Then? We know I is at position1? 
- Or? If I? is not? But then? How? But if I(-)? Then I is at position5? 

Similarly? O and Y? 

But? Then? We? Will? Be? Able? To? Deduce? 

But? Considering we have 6 tries? Let? Us? Guess? 

I? Will? Guess? 

The? Word? 

IRONY? 

So? 

But? Maybe? 

After? Feedback? 

We? Can? Then? Adjust? 

So? 

Feedback? 

For? ""irony""? 

Expected? 

But? We? Must? Provide? 

So? 

Guess: IRONY? 

But? Alternatively, let's consider: the word might have I at position5? But rare? 

For efficiency? Perhaps? We can test a letter that covers both possibilities? 

For example? Guess a word? Not necessarily? With the pattern? 

But then? We don't? Have the correct positions? 

We must guess a valid word? And may not include correctly placed letters? 

For example? Guess? ""MOIST""? But M,O,I,S,T? 

Then? But T is excluded? Because T is not in the word (from guess2: T(x))? So guess MOIST would reintroduce T? No? Invalid? 

We can guess only words without T? 

And without C,A,E,P,T? 

Then? 

But it must be valid? 

For example? ""GUILD""? Then? Has U,I,L,D? 

But pattern: we have R and N fixed? So? 

But GUILD? G U I L D? 

If? The? Secret? Is? ? R ? N ?? 

Then? Feedback? G u i l d? 

Then? 

But? We don't know? 

But? We? Have? 

This? Is? Less? Efficient? 

So? Sticking to words with R at position2 and N at position4 might be better? 

Therefore? Let's? 

Guess: IRONY? 

So? 

<guess>irony</guess>
</think>
Based on previous feedback:
- From ""crane"": R (position 2) and N (position 4) are confirmed. Letters C, A, E are absent.
- From ""print"": I is present but not in position 3. Letters P and T are absent.  
The secret word pattern is `_ R _ N _`, with I appearing elsewhere (position 1 or 5). Eliminated letters: C, A, E, P, T.

Possible words:  
- Since I cannot be in position 3 and must appear, it likely occupies position 1 or 5.
- ""IRONY"" fits the pattern: I (position 1), R (2), O (3), N (4), Y (5). It tests new letters O and Y while confirming R, N, and I positioning.

If ""IRONY"" is incorrect, its feedback will clarify:  
- Whether I is in position 1 (via ✓ or -)  
- New information on O and Y  

<guess>irony</guess>",irony,"We have feedback from two guesses:

**First Guess: crane**
- C(x) -> C is not in the word
- R(✓) -> R is in the word and in position 2
- A(x) -> A is not in the word
- N(✓) -> N is in the word and in position 4
- E(x) -> E is not in the word

So from guess 1, we know:
- The word has R in position 2 and N in position 4.
- The letters C, A, E are not in the word.

**Second Guess: print**
- P(x) -> P is not in the word
- R(✓) -> R is in position 2 (we already knew this)
- I(-) -> I is in the word but NOT in position 3
- N(✓) -> N is in position 4 (we already knew this)
- T(x) -> T is not in the word

New information:
- I is in the word, but not at position 3.
- P and T are not in the word.

So now, we know:
- Letters in the word: R (position 2), N (position 4), and I (somewhere except position 3).
- Letters NOT in the word: C, A, E, P, T.

The secret word pattern: _ R _ N _
- Position 1: unknown, cannot be C,A,E,P,T (or the other eliminated letters)
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: unknown, cannot be I (because we have I(-) at position 3) and cannot be C,A,E,P,T
- Position 4: N
- Position 5: unknown, cannot be C,A,E,P,T

I is present in the word but not at position 3. Therefore, I can be at position 1, 5, or maybe even position 3? Wait, no: the feedback for I is that it is in the word but not at position 3 (marked as ""-""), so it cannot be at position 3. So position 3 is definitely not I.

Possible positions for I: 1 or 5? But note the pattern is _ R _ N _, so positions 1, 3, 5 are available (but 3 is excluded for I). Also, note that position 3 can be some letter that hasn't been tried? And similarly for 1 and 5.

We must form a word that:
- Has R at position 2, N at position 4.
- Contains the letter I (but not at position 3).
- Does not contain C, A, E, P, T.

We have used letters: C,R,A,N,E in first guess and P,R,I,N,T in second. So we have not tested: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,O,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. But Q,X,Z are less common.

Common letters we might try: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,O,S,U,W,Y.

We must form a valid word with pattern _ R _ N _ 

Also, we know I appears somewhere, but not in position 3. So the I must be at position 1 or 5? Because position 2 and 4 are R and N and fixed. But if we consider duplicate letters? We don't know, but perhaps avoid duplicates for now.

So, the word must have I either at position 1 or position 5.

Possible words:
- Option 1: Position 1: I -> pattern I R _ N _
  - Then position 3 and 5 need to be filled. But note: position 3 cannot be I (already placed at pos1) and we avoid duplicates? If the word has two I's, that would be okay? But for efficiency, let's assume no duplicates until proven otherwise.
  - Words: IRON? -> wait, IRON is four letters? No, IRONS? But IRONS has S at the end? IRONS is 5 letters? I-R-O-N-S.
  - Consider: IRONS -> I R O N S -> but this has O at position 3? Yes.
  - Another possibility: IRK? -> too short. I R I N something? Two I's: if allowed? But not efficient? We haven't been forced to consider duplicates.

- Option 2: Position 5: I -> pattern _ R _ N I
  - Then: words like ?? R? N I -> examples: CAR?N?I -> no A/C. URN?I? -> URN is three letters? What about BRINY? B R I N Y -> but that has I in position 3? But we cannot have I in position 3? Here we put I at position 5? So pattern _ R _ N I -> example: C R A N I -> but A and C are excluded. 
  - Words: URN?I isn't a 5-letter word? Examples: ORDNI? Not a word. GU?NI? Not valid? 
  - Known words: HOR?I -> H O R N I -> but HORN? HORNS? HORNS has S? No: HORNS has N at position 4? Pattern must have N at position 4? H O R N S -> but we need the fifth letter to be I? Then it would be HORNI? Not valid. 
  - Alternative: G R O N I -> isn't a word. 
  - More: B R O N I -> BROWN? No, BROWN is B R O W N? Pattern B R O W N -> which is 5 letters? But W in position 4? Wrong? We require N at position 4. 

Wait, let me think differently: common words ending in I? 

Actually, the pattern must be: 
  position1: ? (letter not C,A,E,P,T)
  position2: R
  position3: ? (not I, and not C,A,E,P,T)
  position4: N
  position5: I? -> then what words? 

Words ending with NI: 
  SUN?I? Not SUNNI? SUNNI is a word? It means... but let's check: S U N N I -> wait, that's 5? S U N I? Not 5 letters? SUNNI? SUNN?I? Perhaps: 
UNION? But U N I O N -> pattern doesn't match? We require position2=R? Not R? Doesn't match.

Let me list possible words with the pattern _ R _ N _ and containing I.

First, if I is at position 1: words starting with IR?N? -> examples: 
  IRONY: I R O N Y -> positions: I(1), R(2), O(3), N(4), Y(5). 
  Check: O and Y are not excluded? And I at position1? Then position3 is O? We haven't tested O? And position5 is Y? 
  Also, IRONS? I R O N S -> O at position3? S at position5? 
  But we cannot have I at position3? That is satisfied.

Second, if I is at position 5: words ending with ...N?I? That would be ...N I? But we need R?N?I? Pattern: _ R _ N I -> positions: pos1: ?, pos3: ?. 
  Words: 
      UR?NI -> are there words? U R B N I? URBAN? No. 
      OR?NI -> ORGAN? -> O R G A N? A excluded? And N is position5? But pattern must N at4? ORGAN is O R G A N -> positions: O(1), R(2), G(3), A(4) -> but we require N at position4? So no? 
      Must have N at position4? So the pattern ? R ? N I? 
      Examples: GRENI? -> not a valid word? 
      DRUNI? Not valid? 
      BRAND? But A excluded? 
  Actually, I cannot recall any common 5-letter word ending in NI? So maybe low probability? 

Given that, it seems more likely that I is at position 1? But wait, what about position 3? We know position3 cannot be I? But what if we put I at position1? Then the word becomes IRON? something? 

But wait, there might be words with I at a different position? For example, if the word has two letters? But we haven't eliminated the possibility? 

Alternatively, note that the feedback for ""print"" has I(-) meaning I is in the word but not at position3? It does not say where it is? It could be anywhere else? So including position1 or 5? Also note: position2 is R? Position4 is N? So the other spots: 1,3,5? But position3 cannot be I? Therefore, I must be at position1 or position5? 

But if we cannot find a word with I at position5? Then we look at position1? 

So let's consider IRONY: 
  I R O N Y -> 
  Suppose the secret word is IRONY? 
  Then feedback for ""print"": 
      P vs I? -> P is absent? ✓ we got x -> correct? 
      R vs R? ✓
      I vs O? -> I is present? Because the word has I at position1? Then it should give I(-) for print? Because position3 of ""print"" had I? But the actual I is at position1? So we get ""-"" for I? Which matches? 
      N vs N? ✓
      T vs Y? -> T is absent? ✓ we got x.

So it matches feedback? But maybe it's the word? So we could guess it? 

But we need to test? 

Alternative: BRIN? -> BRINE? But E excluded? BRINY? B R I N Y -> but then I is at position3? That would be problem? Position3 cannot be I? Because we have I(-) at position3? So BRINY would be: B R I N Y -> I at position3? Then if BRINY is the word, then we should have feedback for ""print"" at position3: I vs secret? Position3: I vs I? Then it should be ✓? But we got I(-) which means wrong position? So contradiction? 

Therefore, BRINY is impossible? Because it would put I at position3? 

Similarly, any word with I at position3 would have given I(✓) in ""print""? But we didn't? So no word has I at position3? 

Therefore, I must be at position1 or position5? 

We saw IRONY? What about IRONS? 
  IRONS: I R O N S -> contains I at position1? 

If we guess IRONS? Then:
  We are testing O and S? 

But maybe we want to test the possibility of I at position1? Or what if we want to test for position5? 

But note: we also need to fill position3? Position3 must be a letter that hasn't been eliminated? 

We have eliminated: C,A,E,P,T? And we know the word has I? Then? 

Possible words:
  If I at 1: 
      IRONY: I R O N Y -> O and Y are untested?
      IRONS: I R O N S -> O and S? 
      I R I N * -> but then two I? If allowed? Example: IRING? Not valid? IRINS? Not sure? 

  If I at 5: 
      ? R ? N I -> 
      FR?NI? Like FRENI? Not valid? 
      GR?NI? GRUNI? Not valid.
      DR?NI? Not common? 
      Only a few: 
      UR in the beginning? Urban not matching? 
      Maybe WR?NI? WRING? WRING? W R I N G -> but W R I N G? Then I is in position3? That would be a problem? Pattern: W R I N G -> position3=I? Then same as BRINY? 

Actually, WR?NI? If we require position5=I? Then WRING becomes W R I N I? But that has I at position3? And 5? Then if we guess ""print""? We will have I at position3? But that would give I(✓) if the secret has I at position3? But we have I(-) so position3 is not I? So WRING? It has I at position3? So invalid? 

Therefore, words that have I at position3 cannot be? 

But what about words with I at position1? 

Other words? 
  IR?N? with new letters: IRISH? 5 letters? I R I S H -> but pattern? Position4:N? No? IRISH is I R I S H -> position4 is S? Then not matching? We require position4=N? 

  Only words that match _ R _ N _ and have N at position4? 

So words like: ? R ? N ? 

Common words: 
  BRAWN? But A excluded? 
  BROWN? O at position3? Position4 is W? No? BROWN is B R O W N -> positions: B(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5)? But we require N at position4? Then no? 
  CROWN? C excluded? 
  GROUP? No N? 
  GRAND? A excluded? 
  GRO?N? GROAN? No, A excluded? 

Given the constraints? Let me think of words: 
  IRONY: I R O N Y -> fits? 
  DRO?N? No? 

Another word: URINE? But U R I N E -> E? Excluded? Not allowed? 

FORUM? Doesn't have N? 
BRING? B R I N G -> I is at position3? Forbidden? 

HORNY? H R O N Y -> positions: H(1), R(2), O(3), N(4), Y(5)? Then I? Where is the I? We need to have I? But HORNY doesn't have I? But the word has I? Because we got feedback at guess2: I(-) meaning I is in the word? But HORNY has no I? So it cannot be? 

So only words with I? And pattern? 

Therefore? Either:
  The word must have I at position1? Then we have words like: 
      IRONY (using O and Y)
      IRONS (using O and S)

Or? At position5? And I cannot recall? So maybe position1 is more likely? 

So? We can choose between IRONY and IRONS? But note: we don't know if O is in the word? 

We could make a guess that tests O at position3? Because both IRONY and IRONS have O at position3? 

But if we guess IRONY? Then if O is correct? And Y? Or if we guess IRONS? 

But we can get information? 

Alternatively? Maybe we guess a word that tests multiple possibilities? 

But with only 6 tries? 

Also? Since position3 is crucial? We can choose a word that tests a new letter at position3? 

Remember? Position3 cannot be I? And can not be C,A,E,P,T? 

We have not tested: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,O,S,U,W,Y? etc? 

We guess? 
  Position1: B? Or? 
  Position3: O? 

But we know I must be somewhere? 

We have two main possibilities: I at position1 or position5? 

Case 1: I at position1? Then the word starts with I? Pattern: I R ? N ? 

Case 2: I at position5? Pattern: ? R ? N I? 

We don't have enough information to distinguish? So let's test the letter O at position3? 

For example? Guess a word like: GRO?N? GROAN? But A excluded?

We need a word that has:
  Position2=R, Position4=N? But if I at position1? Then we cannot? 

Alternatively? Design a guess to test I at position1? 

Let me try: if we guess ""irony""? Then:
  If irony is the word? We win? 
  Otherwise? The feedback tells us:

But if we guess IRONY? Then? 

Or we could guess a word that has I? But not necessarily at position1? But we have to put I somewhere? 

But note? The word has R?N? And I? 

So? Let me choose to test position1 for I? 

Specifically? We can guess IRONY.

If IRONY is the word? Then we solve it? 

If not? We might get feedback? For example, if I is in the word? Then we might know? 

But? Suppose we guess IRONY? And it is not the word? Then feedback might be:

If the secret word has I at position1? Then we get I(✓)? And if O at position3? Then O(?) and Y(?) etc.? 

Alternatively? We could try a word that has I at position5? But? We don't know one? 

So? Either? There is no word with I at position5? Or we haven't found it? 

But? Maybe? DRUNK? But K? And no I? 

I think for now? We focus on words that start with I? 

Also? Consider the possibility that position1 is I? Then position3 and position5 are open? 

We saw IRONY and IRONS? 

What about other words? 

IRK? Not long enough? 

I R B N? Not found? 

A valid word list? 

In the context? Perhaps? Also: BRI? but with I at end? Not pattern? 

Another thought: the word could be GRIND? G R I N D? But then I at position3? That is disallowed? Because ""print"" had I at position3? and got marked as '-'? Then if it were at position3? It should be marked correctly? But we got wrong position? So? No? 

Therefore? We focus on I at position1? 

Now? Which to choose: IRONY or IRONS? 

We have used: C,R,A,N,E,P,R,I,N,T? 

In IRONY? We test O and Y? 

In IRONS? We test O and S? 

S is more common? 

We might want to test? 

But? Maybe? We guess IRONS? Because S might be common? 

But? Alternatively: since we don't know? 

I choose: IRONY? For the guess? Because it tests O and Y? And if not the answer? We get feedback about O and Y? 

But if we guess IRONY? And the word is IRONS? Then we will have:

Feedback for IRONY? 

Suppose secret? IRONS? Then:
  I vs I? ✓
  R vs R? ✓
  O vs O? But position3: O vs O? Then ✓? Because we got ✓? 
  Then? Then N vs N? ✓? 
  Y vs S? If Y? Then? Not present? So? 

But wait? Secret? IRONS? Guess? IRONY? 

Position1: I=✓? 
Position2: R=✓? 
Position3: O=✓? Because secret? O is at position3? 
Position4: N=✓? 
Position5: Y? Secret? S? So? S? Y is not in the word? So? Y(x)? 

But we do not know? We get feedback? 

Similarly? If we guess IRONY? And the secret is another word? 

But? What? Other words? 

What about: CRON? Not valid? 

So? Since IRONY and IRONS are both possible? And they are very similar? 

Alternatively? We might test? But? We don't have a guess that covers both? 

Because IRONY uses Y? And IRONS uses S? 

We might choose: ""ironB""? Not? 

So? I choose? To guess IRONY? 

So? Let's guess ""IRONY"".

And if it's not? We have feedback? 

But note? If IRONY is guessed? And it's not the word? Then:
- If I? ✓? Then? We know I is at position1? 
- Or? If I? is not? But then? How? But if I(-)? Then I is at position5? 

Similarly? O and Y? 

But? Then? We? Will? Be? Able? To? Deduce? 

But? Considering we have 6 tries? Let? Us? Guess? 

I? Will? Guess? 

The? Word? 

IRONY? 

So? 

But? Maybe? 

After? Feedback? 

We? Can? Then? Adjust? 

So? 

Feedback? 

For? ""irony""? 

Expected? 

But? We? Must? Provide? 

So? 

Guess: IRONY? 

But? Alternatively, let's consider: the word might have I at position5? But rare? 

For efficiency? Perhaps? We can test a letter that covers both possibilities? 

For example? Guess a word? Not necessarily? With the pattern? 

But then? We don't? Have the correct positions? 

We must guess a valid word? And may not include correctly placed letters? 

For example? Guess? ""MOIST""? But M,O,I,S,T? 

Then? But T is excluded? Because T is not in the word (from guess2: T(x))? So guess MOIST would reintroduce T? No? Invalid? 

We can guess only words without T? 

And without C,A,E,P,T? 

Then? 

But it must be valid? 

For example? ""GUILD""? Then? Has U,I,L,D? 

But pattern: we have R and N fixed? So? 

But GUILD? G U I L D? 

If? The? Secret? Is? ? R ? N ?? 

Then? Feedback? G u i l d? 

Then? 

But? We don't know? 

But? We? Have? 

This? Is? Less? Efficient? 

So? Sticking to words with R at position2 and N at position4 might be better? 

Therefore? Let's? 

Guess: IRONY? 

So? 

<guess>irony</guess>Based on previous feedback:
- From ""crane"": R (position 2) and N (position 4) are confirmed. Letters C, A, E are absent.
- From ""print"": I is present but not in position 3. Letters P and T are absent.  
The secret word pattern is `_ R _ N _`, with I appearing elsewhere (position 1 or 5). Eliminated letters: C, A, E, P, T.

Possible words:  
- Since I cannot be in position 3 and must appear, it likely occupies position 1 or 5.
- ""IRONY"" fits the pattern: I (position 1), R (2), O (3), N (4), Y (5). It tests new letters O and Y while confirming R, N, and I positioning.

If ""IRONY"" is incorrect, its feedback will clarify:  
- Whether I is in position 1 (via ✓ or -)  
- New information on O and Y",Guess 3: irony -> FEEDBACK: I(✓) R(✓) O(✓) N(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
