We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: ✓ (correct position, so N is the 4th letter)
 E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the 5th letter)

 Therefore, we know:
 - The 4th letter is N.
 - The 5th letter is E.
 - The letters C, R, A are not in the word at all.

 Since the word is 5 letters and we know the last two are ""N"" and ""E"", the word ends with ""NE"".

 We also know that C, R, A are absent. So we must avoid these letters.

 For the next guess, we need to:
 1. Have a 5-letter word ending with ""NE"" (since positions 4 and 5 are fixed as N and E).
 2. Avoid using C, R, A.

 However, note that the feedback for the first guess only told us about the letters in ""crane"". We don't know about the first three letters.

 We can consider common words ending with ""NE"". Some examples: 
   alone, shine, stone, phone, plane, etc.

 But we must avoid C, R, A. So:
 - ""alone"" has A (which is absent) -> invalid.
 - ""plane"" has A and also P and L which we don't know about.

 But note: the word must not contain A, so we cannot use words with A.

 Also, we know that the first three letters are not known and we have to avoid C, R, A.

 Let's think of words ending in ""NE"" without A, C, R.

 Some possibilities:
   phone -> P, H, O, N, E -> but we don't know if P, H, O are in the word.
   stone -> S, T, O, N, E -> avoid A, C, R -> valid.
   shine -> S, H, I, N, E -> valid.
   thine -> T, H, I, N, E -> valid.
   spine -> S, P, I, N, E -> valid.

 We want to maximize information. We should try to cover common letters that we haven't tested yet.

 In the first guess, we tested: C, R, A, N, E. We know N and E are in and in the correct positions, and C, R, A are out.

 So we haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We should choose a word that uses as many of the common unused letters as possible.

 Common letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. But we already know A and R are out, and we have N and E.

 So next common: T, O, I, S, H, D, L, U.

 We can try to include T, O, I, S, H, etc.

 Let's try to form a word with the pattern __ N E (last two fixed) and the first three being new letters.

 We can choose ""stone"": S, T, O, N, E -> tests S, T, O (all new) and we know N and E are fixed.

 But note: the word might have duplicate letters? We don't know, but we can avoid duplicates to test more.

 Alternatively, ""shine"": S, H, I, N, E -> tests S, H, I.

 Another: ""phone"": P, H, O, N, E -> tests P, H, O.

 We don't have any information about the first three letters, so we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 However, note that the word might have the same letter multiple times? But we don't have any indication of that yet.

 Since we have two positions fixed, we are only guessing the first three. We can choose a word that uses three new common letters.

 Let's choose ""stone"" because it uses S, T, O which are common.

 But wait: we must ensure that the word is valid and doesn't use any of the absent letters (C, R, A). ""stone"" is valid.

 Alternatively, we could choose ""shine"" to test S, H, I.

 How about ""spine""? It tests S, P, I.

 We want to cover the most common letters. The frequency order in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. 
 Since A and R are out, the next are T, O, I, S, H.

 So ""stone"" covers T, O, and S (and we get S and T which are very common).

 But note: we are also testing the positions. We are putting S at position 1, T at 2, O at 3.

 However, we don't know if the word has these letters. We are trying to get information.

 Another candidate: ""thine"" (if we consider it common enough) -> T, H, I.

 But ""thine"" is less common.

 We can also consider ""tune"", but that's 4 letters? No, we need 5: T U N E -> that's 4. So we need 5: ""tunes"" but that ends with S, not NE? 
 We need the last two to be NE. So we must have the 4th as N and 5th as E.

 So the word must be of the form ??? N E.

 Therefore, we choose ""stone"": S T O N E.

 But note: we are not forced to have the first three letters as the only ones we test. We can also test letters that might appear in the first three but we don't know.

 However, we are going to get feedback on each position.

 Let's go with ""stone"".

 But wait: what if the word is ""phone""? We don't know. We are just trying to get more information.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn't have the fixed N and E in the same positions? 
 But the feedback told us that in ""crane"", N and E were in the correct positions. So they must be in the 4th and 5th.

 Therefore, we must have a word that has N at position 4 and E at position 5.

 So we choose ""stone"".

 However, note: the word might have more than one N or E? But we don't know. We only know that there is an N at position 4 and an E at position 5.

 We are going to guess ""stone"".

 But let me check: 
   stone: S (position1), T (2), O (3), N (4), E (5)

 We are testing S, T, O in the first three positions and confirming the last two.

 If we get feedback:
   If S is in the word and in the correct position, we get a check.
   If S is in the word but wrong position, we get a dash.
   If S is not in the word, we get an x.

 Same for T and O.

 This will give us information about the first three letters.

 So, we'll go with ""stone"".

<guess>stone</guess>

After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- ""N"" is correct and in position 4 (✓)
- ""E"" is correct and in position 5 (✓)
- ""C"", ""R"", and ""A"" are absent (x)

This means:
1. The 4th letter is **N** and the 5th letter is **E** (so the word ends with **NE**).
2. The letters **C, R, A** are *not* in the word.
3. The first three letters are unknown but must exclude C, R, A.

For the next guess:
- I need a 5-letter word ending with **NE**.
- It should avoid C, R, A entirely.
- To maximize new information, I'll prioritize common unused letters (e.g., S, T, O, I, H) in positions 1–3.

A strong candidate is **STONE**:
- Tests **S, T, O** (high-frequency letters not yet probed).
- Confirms the fixed **N** (position 4) and **E** (position 5).
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A).

This guess will efficiently narrow down possibilities for the first three letters.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn't have the fixed N and E in the same positions? 
 But the feedback told us that in ""crane"", N and E were in the correct positions. So they must be in the 4th and 5th.

 Therefore, we must have a word that has N at position 4 and E at position 5.

 So we choose ""stone"".

 However, note: the word might have more than one N or E? But we don't know. We only know that there is an N at position 4 and an E at position 5.

 We are going to guess ""stone"".

 But let me check: 
   stone: S (position1), T (2), O (3), N (4), E (5)

 We are testing S, T, O in the first three positions and confirming the last two.

 If we get feedback:
   If S is in the word and in the correct position, we get a check.
   If S is in the word but wrong position, we get a dash.
   If S is not in the word, we get an x.

 Same for T and O.

 This will give us information about the first three letters.

 So, we'll go with ""stone"".

<guess>stone</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- ""N"" is correct and in position 4 (✓)
- ""E"" is correct and in position 5 (✓)
- ""C"", ""R"", and ""A"" are absent (x)

This means:
1. The 4th letter is **N** and the 5th letter is **E** (so the word ends with **NE**).
2. The letters **C, R, A** are *not* in the word.
3. The first three letters are unknown but must exclude C, R, A.

For the next guess:
- I need a 5-letter word ending with **NE**.
- It should avoid C, R, A entirely.
- To maximize new information, I'll prioritize common unused letters (e.g., S, T, O, I, H) in positions 1–3.

A strong candidate is **STONE**:
- Tests **S, T, O** (high-frequency letters not yet probed).
- Confirms the fixed **N** (position 4) and **E** (position 5).
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A).

This guess will efficiently narrow down possibilities for the first three letters.

We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(✓)
  - This means:
      - The 4th letter is N (correct position).
      - The 5th letter is E (correct position).
      - C, R, A are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: ""stone"" -> S(x) T(x) O(-) N(✓) E(✓)
  - Interpretation:
      - S is not in the word (x).
      - T is not in the word (x).
      - O is in the word but in the wrong position (-). So O is present, but not at position 3.
      - N and E are correct and in position (as we already knew).

So now we know:
  - The word ends with ""NE"" (positions 4 and 5).
  - The word contains the letter O, but not at position 3 (and not at 4 or 5, so it must be in one of the first two positions? But wait, positions 1, 2, or 3? However, we tried O at position 3 and it was wrong, so O is in the word but not at 3. Since positions 4 and 5 are fixed as N and E, O must be in position 1 or 2.
  - Absent letters: C, R, A, S, T.

Therefore, the word has the form: _ _ _ N E, and the third position is not O (but we now know O is in the word, so it must be in position 1 or 2).

Also, we have eliminated: A, C, R, S, T.

We need to find a word that:
  - Has 5 letters, ends with ""NE""
  - Contains the letter O (which must be in position 1 or 2)
  - Does not contain A, C, R, S, T.

Let's think of possible words.

The first three letters are unknown, but we know one of them must be O (at position 1 or 2). The other two letters must be from the remaining alphabet excluding A, C, R, S, T.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: O is already in the word, so we have to use it in position 1 or 2.

We can consider two cases: O in position 1 or O in position 2.

Case 1: O at position 1 -> word: O _ _ N E
Case 2: O at position 2 -> word: _ O _ N E

We need to fill the remaining positions with letters from the available set.

We also want to maximize information for the next guess, so we should try to use as many new common letters as possible.

But note: we are limited by the fact that we must have a valid word.

Let's list some possibilities:

For Case 1 (O _ _ N E):
  - Common words: 
      ""OPINE"" -> but P and I are new. However, we must check if it's valid: O, P, I, N, E. 
        - We haven't eliminated P or I. 
        - But note: we have to avoid A, C, R, S, T. So ""OPINE"" is acceptable? 
        - However, we don't know if P and I are in the word. But we are trying to guess.

But wait, we are not forced to have the O in the first position? We know O is in the word and not at position 3, so it must be at 1 or 2. We don't know which, so we might want to test both possibilities? But we can only guess one word.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has O in one of the first two positions and tests other new letters.

We also note that we have two unknown positions (if we fix O at 1, then positions 2 and 3 are unknown; if O is at 2, then positions 1 and 3 are unknown). But we don't know which case.

We can design a guess that helps us determine the position of O and also tests other letters.

But note: we have to have the last two as N and E.

So the guess must end with NE.

We can try a word that has O in position 1 and two new letters in 2 and 3, or O in position 2 and two new letters in 1 and 3.

However, we don't know which one is correct. So we should choose a word that has O in one of the first two positions and then uses two new common letters.

But we must avoid the absent letters: A, C, R, S, T.

Let me try to think of words ending in NE that have O in the first two positions and don't contain A, C, R, S, T.

Possibilities:
  - O in position 1: 
      ""OPINE"" (O, P, I, N, E) -> tests P and I.
      ""OWING"" -> but that ends with G? No, we need NE. 
      ""OZONE"" -> but O is repeated? And we have Z. Also, we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But the feedback hasn't shown duplicates. However, the word might have duplicates. But ""ozone"" has two O's and two E's? But we have E at the end, so if we use ""ozone"", it would be O Z O N E. But we don't know if the word has two O's. Also, we are avoiding S, T, etc. but Z is new.

  - O in position 2:
      ""BONEY"" -> B O N E Y? But we need the 4th to be N and 5th E, so that would be B O ? N E -> so the word must be 5 letters: the third letter would be the one before N. So ""BONEY"" is B O N E Y -> that's not ending with NE. We need the last two to be NE, so the word must be ? ? ? N E. So the third letter is the one at position 3, then N at 4, E at 5.

  - Correct pattern: _ _ _ N E.

  For O in position 2: the word is _ O _ N E.

  Examples: 
      ""DOZEN"" -> D O Z E N -> but that ends with EN, not NE? We need NE. So the 4th must be N and 5th E. ""DOZEN"" is D O Z E N -> positions: 1:D, 2:O, 3:Z, 4:E, 5:N -> that doesn't match because we need 4th to be N and 5th E.

  We must have the 4th as N and 5th as E. So the word must be: [1] [2] [3] N E.

  Therefore, for O in position 2: the word is [1] O [3] N E.

  Examples: 
      ""HONEY"" -> H O N E Y -> but that's H O N E Y -> positions: 1:H, 2:O, 3:N, 4:E, 5:Y -> but we need the 4th to be N and 5th E? No, that doesn't work.

  We need the 4th to be N and 5th E. So the word must be: 
      position 1: ?
      position 2: O
      position 3: ? 
      position 4: N
      position 5: E

  So the word is ? O ? N E.

  What words are there? 
      ""BONNE"" -> but that's not common, and has double N? 
      ""CONNE"" -> but C is absent.
      ""DONNE"" -> D O N N E -> but that has two N's? And we know N is at position 4, so the third letter is N? Then the word would be D O N N E -> but that's 5 letters: D, O, N, N, E. 
      However, we don't know if duplicates are allowed. But note: in the first guess, we had N at position 4 and it was correct, and in the second guess we had N at position 4 and it was correct again. But that doesn't tell us if there is another N.

  But we are avoiding C, R, A, S, T. So ""DONNE"" is a surname? Not common. 

  More common: ""TONNE"" -> but T is absent.

  ""PONCE"" -> C is absent and also doesn't end with NE.

  It's tricky. Let me think of more words: 
      ""HORDE"" -> but that ends with DE, not NE.

  Actually, we need the last two to be NE. So let's list words ending with NE that have O in the second position.

  I can think of: 
      ""PHONE"" -> P H O N E -> but that's P H O N E -> positions: 1:P, 2:H, 3:O, 4:N, 5:E -> but we need O at position 2? Here O is at position 3. So that doesn't fit.

  We need O at position 2. So the word must be: [letter] O [letter] N E.

  Examples: 
      ""BOINE"" - not a word.
      ""COINE"" - not a word.
      ""DOINE"" - not a word.
      ""FOINE"" - not standard.
      ""GOINE"" - not a word.
      ""HOINE"" - no.
      ""JOINE"" - archaic?
      ""LOINE"" - no.
      ""MOINE"" - not common.
      ""NOISE"" - but that ends with SE, not NE? And we need NE. Also, S is absent.

  This is difficult. Maybe I should consider O in the first position.

  For O in position 1: O _ _ N E.

  Words: 
      ""OPINE"" - meaning: to express an opinion. This is a valid word. Letters: O, P, I, N, E. 
      ""OLIVE"" - but that ends with VE, not NE.
      ""OZONE"" - O Z O N E -> but that has two O's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, the 4th is N and 5th E? O Z O N E -> positions: 1:O, 2:Z, 3:O, 4:N, 5:E -> so that would be O Z O N E. But we have O at position 1 and 3. We know O is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. However, we haven't been told about duplicates. But note: in the feedback for ""stone"", we had O at position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That doesn't tell us if there is another O.

  But we are trying to form a guess. We can use ""OPINE"".

  Alternatively, ""OUNCE"" -> O U N C E -> but C is absent, and also the 4th letter is C? We need 4th to be N. So that doesn't work.

  Another: ""OWING"" -> doesn't end with NE.

  So ""OPINE"" seems a good candidate.

  But note: we also have the possibility that O is in position 2. We haven't found a common word for that? 

  What about ""MOVIE""? -> ends with IE, not NE.

  Or ""DOZEN"" -> doesn't fit.

  Another idea: ""JOLNE"" - not a word.

  Maybe ""ROGNE"" - not English.

  So perhaps the word has O in position 1? Then ""OPINE"" is a good candidate.

  But we must also consider that we might not have thought of a word with O in position 2.

  Let me search my memory: 
      ""BONIE"" - archaic spelling of ""bonny"", but not standard and doesn't end with NE? It would be B O N I E -> but that's B O N I E -> positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:N, 4:I, 5:E -> but we need the 4th to be N and 5th E. So that doesn't work.

  ""CONNE"" - invalid because of C.

  ""DONNE"" - as above, D O N N E -> that would be: 1:D, 2:O, 3:N, 4:N, 5:E. But then we have N at position 3 and 4. We know that position 4 is N, so if the word has two N's, that's possible. But is ""DONNE"" a word? It's a proper name, but in Wordle, common words are used. 

  However, we are avoiding common words? We need a valid word.

  Another: ""HONEY"" doesn't fit.

  ""TONNE"" has T which is absent.

  So maybe there are no common words with O in position 2? Then the O must be in position 1.

  Therefore, we can assume O is in position 1 and guess ""OPINE"".

  But note: we are not sure. We must design a guess that can test the position of O.

  Alternatively, we can choose a word that has O in position 2 and uses only available letters, even if it's less common? But we don't know.

  However, we have to make a guess. Let's choose ""OPINE"" because it's a common word and tests two new letters (P and I) and has O in position 1.

  But wait: what if the word has O in position 2? Then by guessing ""OPINE"", we put O in position 1 and it would be marked as absent? But we know O is in the word, so if we put it in position 1 and it's actually in position 2, then we would get a dash (present but wrong position) for O.

  So by guessing ""OPINE"", we can get information about the position of O.

  Specifically:
      If O is in position 1, then we get a check for O at position 1.
      If O is in position 2, then we get a dash for O at position 1 (because it's present but in the wrong position) and then we know it must be in position 2.

  Also, we test P and I.

  So that's good.

  But note: we are also testing the third letter as I. If the word has I at position 3, we get a check; if I is in the word but elsewhere, we get a dash; if not, we get an x.

  So we'll go with ""OPINE"".

  However, we must avoid the absent letters: A, C, R, S, T. ""OPINE"" has O, P, I, N, E -> no A, C, R, S, T. So it's valid.

  Therefore, we guess ""OPINE"".

But wait, what about the possibility of O in position 2? We are testing O in position 1. If we get a dash for O, then we know it's in position 2. Then we can look for words with O in position 2 and the last two NE.

But we are not sure if such a word exists? But if it doesn't, then O must be in position 1.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has O in position 2? But we couldn't find a common one. So let's stick with ""OPINE"".

Another candidate: ""OUNCE"" is invalid because of C.

""OLIVE"" doesn't end with NE.

So ""OPINE"" it is.

But note: we are also testing the letter I at position 3. If the word has I, then we get information about that.

We could choose a word that has O in position 1 and then two very common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.

But we are already using P and I.

Another word: ""OAKEN"" -> but A is absent, and also it's O A K E N -> that's O A K E N -> positions: 1:O, 2:A, 3:K, 4:E, 5:N -> but we need 4th to be N and 5th E? That doesn't match. Also, A is absent.

So I think ""OPINE"" is a good choice.

Therefore, we guess ""OPINE"".

But let me double-check the feedback we have:

We know:
  - The word: _ _ _ N E
  - Contains O (not at position 3, so at 1 or 2)
  - Absent: A, C, R, S, T

So the word is one of:
  O ? ? N E   (with the third letter not O, but we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But we haven't seen any duplicate yet, so we assume no duplicate until we see evidence? But we can't assume that.)

But in ""OPINE"", we are putting O at 1, and then P at 2, I at 3.

If the word has O at position 2, then in ""OPINE"" we have O at 1 (which is wrong) and then we have P at 2 and I at 3. The feedback will tell us if P and I are in the word.

So we get information regardless.

We'll go with ""OPINE"".

<guess>opine</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: N(✓) and E(✓) are confirmed in positions 4 and 5, while C, R, A are absent.
- **Guess 2 (STONE)**: N(✓) and E(✓) are reconfirmed in positions 4 and 5, O(-) is present but not in position 3, and S/T are absent.

### Key Insights:
1. The word ends with **NE** (positions 4 and 5 are fixed).
2. **O is in the word** but not in position 3 (so it must be in position 1 or 2).
3. **Absent letters**: A, C, R, S, T (cannot be used).
4. The first three positions are unknown, but one of them must be O (position 1 or 2).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Test **O in position 1** (since position 3 is ruled out, and position 2 is still possible but untested).
- Use new high-frequency letters (e.g., P, I) for positions 2 and 3 to maximize information.
- Avoid absent letters (A, C, R, S, T).

### Chosen Guess: **OPINE**
- **O**: Tests position 1 (if correct, we get ✓; if misplaced, O must be in position 2).
- **P and I**: New common letters tested in positions 2 and 3.
- **NE**: Confirms fixed positions 4 and 5.
- **Valid word**: No absent letters, and fits the pattern.

This guess efficiently narrows down the location of O while probing new letters.

<guess>opine</guess>",opine,"We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(✓)
  - This means:
      - The 4th letter is N (correct position).
      - The 5th letter is E (correct position).
      - C, R, A are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: ""stone"" -> S(x) T(x) O(-) N(✓) E(✓)
  - Interpretation:
      - S is not in the word (x).
      - T is not in the word (x).
      - O is in the word but in the wrong position (-). So O is present, but not at position 3.
      - N and E are correct and in position (as we already knew).

So now we know:
  - The word ends with ""NE"" (positions 4 and 5).
  - The word contains the letter O, but not at position 3 (and not at 4 or 5, so it must be in one of the first two positions? But wait, positions 1, 2, or 3? However, we tried O at position 3 and it was wrong, so O is in the word but not at 3. Since positions 4 and 5 are fixed as N and E, O must be in position 1 or 2.
  - Absent letters: C, R, A, S, T.

Therefore, the word has the form: _ _ _ N E, and the third position is not O (but we now know O is in the word, so it must be in position 1 or 2).

Also, we have eliminated: A, C, R, S, T.

We need to find a word that:
  - Has 5 letters, ends with ""NE""
  - Contains the letter O (which must be in position 1 or 2)
  - Does not contain A, C, R, S, T.

Let's think of possible words.

The first three letters are unknown, but we know one of them must be O (at position 1 or 2). The other two letters must be from the remaining alphabet excluding A, C, R, S, T.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: O is already in the word, so we have to use it in position 1 or 2.

We can consider two cases: O in position 1 or O in position 2.

Case 1: O at position 1 -> word: O _ _ N E
Case 2: O at position 2 -> word: _ O _ N E

We need to fill the remaining positions with letters from the available set.

We also want to maximize information for the next guess, so we should try to use as many new common letters as possible.

But note: we are limited by the fact that we must have a valid word.

Let's list some possibilities:

For Case 1 (O _ _ N E):
  - Common words: 
      ""OPINE"" -> but P and I are new. However, we must check if it's valid: O, P, I, N, E. 
        - We haven't eliminated P or I. 
        - But note: we have to avoid A, C, R, S, T. So ""OPINE"" is acceptable? 
        - However, we don't know if P and I are in the word. But we are trying to guess.

But wait, we are not forced to have the O in the first position? We know O is in the word and not at position 3, so it must be at 1 or 2. We don't know which, so we might want to test both possibilities? But we can only guess one word.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has O in one of the first two positions and tests other new letters.

We also note that we have two unknown positions (if we fix O at 1, then positions 2 and 3 are unknown; if O is at 2, then positions 1 and 3 are unknown). But we don't know which case.

We can design a guess that helps us determine the position of O and also tests other letters.

But note: we have to have the last two as N and E.

So the guess must end with NE.

We can try a word that has O in position 1 and two new letters in 2 and 3, or O in position 2 and two new letters in 1 and 3.

However, we don't know which one is correct. So we should choose a word that has O in one of the first two positions and then uses two new common letters.

But we must avoid the absent letters: A, C, R, S, T.

Let me try to think of words ending in NE that have O in the first two positions and don't contain A, C, R, S, T.

Possibilities:
  - O in position 1: 
      ""OPINE"" (O, P, I, N, E) -> tests P and I.
      ""OWING"" -> but that ends with G? No, we need NE. 
      ""OZONE"" -> but O is repeated? And we have Z. Also, we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But the feedback hasn't shown duplicates. However, the word might have duplicates. But ""ozone"" has two O's and two E's? But we have E at the end, so if we use ""ozone"", it would be O Z O N E. But we don't know if the word has two O's. Also, we are avoiding S, T, etc. but Z is new.

  - O in position 2:
      ""BONEY"" -> B O N E Y? But we need the 4th to be N and 5th E, so that would be B O ? N E -> so the word must be 5 letters: the third letter would be the one before N. So ""BONEY"" is B O N E Y -> that's not ending with NE. We need the last two to be NE, so the word must be ? ? ? N E. So the third letter is the one at position 3, then N at 4, E at 5.

  - Correct pattern: _ _ _ N E.

  For O in position 2: the word is _ O _ N E.

  Examples: 
      ""DOZEN"" -> D O Z E N -> but that ends with EN, not NE? We need NE. So the 4th must be N and 5th E. ""DOZEN"" is D O Z E N -> positions: 1:D, 2:O, 3:Z, 4:E, 5:N -> that doesn't match because we need 4th to be N and 5th E.

  We must have the 4th as N and 5th as E. So the word must be: [1] [2] [3] N E.

  Therefore, for O in position 2: the word is [1] O [3] N E.

  Examples: 
      ""HONEY"" -> H O N E Y -> but that's H O N E Y -> positions: 1:H, 2:O, 3:N, 4:E, 5:Y -> but we need the 4th to be N and 5th E? No, that doesn't work.

  We need the 4th to be N and 5th E. So the word must be: 
      position 1: ?
      position 2: O
      position 3: ? 
      position 4: N
      position 5: E

  So the word is ? O ? N E.

  What words are there? 
      ""BONNE"" -> but that's not common, and has double N? 
      ""CONNE"" -> but C is absent.
      ""DONNE"" -> D O N N E -> but that has two N's? And we know N is at position 4, so the third letter is N? Then the word would be D O N N E -> but that's 5 letters: D, O, N, N, E. 
      However, we don't know if duplicates are allowed. But note: in the first guess, we had N at position 4 and it was correct, and in the second guess we had N at position 4 and it was correct again. But that doesn't tell us if there is another N.

  But we are avoiding C, R, A, S, T. So ""DONNE"" is a surname? Not common. 

  More common: ""TONNE"" -> but T is absent.

  ""PONCE"" -> C is absent and also doesn't end with NE.

  It's tricky. Let me think of more words: 
      ""HORDE"" -> but that ends with DE, not NE.

  Actually, we need the last two to be NE. So let's list words ending with NE that have O in the second position.

  I can think of: 
      ""PHONE"" -> P H O N E -> but that's P H O N E -> positions: 1:P, 2:H, 3:O, 4:N, 5:E -> but we need O at position 2? Here O is at position 3. So that doesn't fit.

  We need O at position 2. So the word must be: [letter] O [letter] N E.

  Examples: 
      ""BOINE"" - not a word.
      ""COINE"" - not a word.
      ""DOINE"" - not a word.
      ""FOINE"" - not standard.
      ""GOINE"" - not a word.
      ""HOINE"" - no.
      ""JOINE"" - archaic?
      ""LOINE"" - no.
      ""MOINE"" - not common.
      ""NOISE"" - but that ends with SE, not NE? And we need NE. Also, S is absent.

  This is difficult. Maybe I should consider O in the first position.

  For O in position 1: O _ _ N E.

  Words: 
      ""OPINE"" - meaning: to express an opinion. This is a valid word. Letters: O, P, I, N, E. 
      ""OLIVE"" - but that ends with VE, not NE.
      ""OZONE"" - O Z O N E -> but that has two O's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, the 4th is N and 5th E? O Z O N E -> positions: 1:O, 2:Z, 3:O, 4:N, 5:E -> so that would be O Z O N E. But we have O at position 1 and 3. We know O is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. However, we haven't been told about duplicates. But note: in the feedback for ""stone"", we had O at position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That doesn't tell us if there is another O.

  But we are trying to form a guess. We can use ""OPINE"".

  Alternatively, ""OUNCE"" -> O U N C E -> but C is absent, and also the 4th letter is C? We need 4th to be N. So that doesn't work.

  Another: ""OWING"" -> doesn't end with NE.

  So ""OPINE"" seems a good candidate.

  But note: we also have the possibility that O is in position 2. We haven't found a common word for that? 

  What about ""MOVIE""? -> ends with IE, not NE.

  Or ""DOZEN"" -> doesn't fit.

  Another idea: ""JOLNE"" - not a word.

  Maybe ""ROGNE"" - not English.

  So perhaps the word has O in position 1? Then ""OPINE"" is a good candidate.

  But we must also consider that we might not have thought of a word with O in position 2.

  Let me search my memory: 
      ""BONIE"" - archaic spelling of ""bonny"", but not standard and doesn't end with NE? It would be B O N I E -> but that's B O N I E -> positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:N, 4:I, 5:E -> but we need the 4th to be N and 5th E. So that doesn't work.

  ""CONNE"" - invalid because of C.

  ""DONNE"" - as above, D O N N E -> that would be: 1:D, 2:O, 3:N, 4:N, 5:E. But then we have N at position 3 and 4. We know that position 4 is N, so if the word has two N's, that's possible. But is ""DONNE"" a word? It's a proper name, but in Wordle, common words are used. 

  However, we are avoiding common words? We need a valid word.

  Another: ""HONEY"" doesn't fit.

  ""TONNE"" has T which is absent.

  So maybe there are no common words with O in position 2? Then the O must be in position 1.

  Therefore, we can assume O is in position 1 and guess ""OPINE"".

  But note: we are not sure. We must design a guess that can test the position of O.

  Alternatively, we can choose a word that has O in position 2 and uses only available letters, even if it's less common? But we don't know.

  However, we have to make a guess. Let's choose ""OPINE"" because it's a common word and tests two new letters (P and I) and has O in position 1.

  But wait: what if the word has O in position 2? Then by guessing ""OPINE"", we put O in position 1 and it would be marked as absent? But we know O is in the word, so if we put it in position 1 and it's actually in position 2, then we would get a dash (present but wrong position) for O.

  So by guessing ""OPINE"", we can get information about the position of O.

  Specifically:
      If O is in position 1, then we get a check for O at position 1.
      If O is in position 2, then we get a dash for O at position 1 (because it's present but in the wrong position) and then we know it must be in position 2.

  Also, we test P and I.

  So that's good.

  But note: we are also testing the third letter as I. If the word has I at position 3, we get a check; if I is in the word but elsewhere, we get a dash; if not, we get an x.

  So we'll go with ""OPINE"".

  However, we must avoid the absent letters: A, C, R, S, T. ""OPINE"" has O, P, I, N, E -> no A, C, R, S, T. So it's valid.

  Therefore, we guess ""OPINE"".

But wait, what about the possibility of O in position 2? We are testing O in position 1. If we get a dash for O, then we know it's in position 2. Then we can look for words with O in position 2 and the last two NE.

But we are not sure if such a word exists? But if it doesn't, then O must be in position 1.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has O in position 2? But we couldn't find a common one. So let's stick with ""OPINE"".

Another candidate: ""OUNCE"" is invalid because of C.

""OLIVE"" doesn't end with NE.

So ""OPINE"" it is.

But note: we are also testing the letter I at position 3. If the word has I, then we get information about that.

We could choose a word that has O in position 1 and then two very common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.

But we are already using P and I.

Another word: ""OAKEN"" -> but A is absent, and also it's O A K E N -> that's O A K E N -> positions: 1:O, 2:A, 3:K, 4:E, 5:N -> but we need 4th to be N and 5th E? That doesn't match. Also, A is absent.

So I think ""OPINE"" is a good choice.

Therefore, we guess ""OPINE"".

But let me double-check the feedback we have:

We know:
  - The word: _ _ _ N E
  - Contains O (not at position 3, so at 1 or 2)
  - Absent: A, C, R, S, T

So the word is one of:
  O ? ? N E   (with the third letter not O, but we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But we haven't seen any duplicate yet, so we assume no duplicate until we see evidence? But we can't assume that.)

But in ""OPINE"", we are putting O at 1, and then P at 2, I at 3.

If the word has O at position 2, then in ""OPINE"" we have O at 1 (which is wrong) and then we have P at 2 and I at 3. The feedback will tell us if P and I are in the word.

So we get information regardless.

We'll go with ""OPINE"".

<guess>opine</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: N(✓) and E(✓) are confirmed in positions 4 and 5, while C, R, A are absent.
- **Guess 2 (STONE)**: N(✓) and E(✓) are reconfirmed in positions 4 and 5, O(-) is present but not in position 3, and S/T are absent.

### Key Insights:
1. The word ends with **NE** (positions 4 and 5 are fixed).
2. **O is in the word** but not in position 3 (so it must be in position 1 or 2).
3. **Absent letters**: A, C, R, S, T (cannot be used).
4. The first three positions are unknown, but one of them must be O (position 1 or 2).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Test **O in position 1** (since position 3 is ruled out, and position 2 is still possible but untested).
- Use new high-frequency letters (e.g., P, I) for positions 2 and 3 to maximize information.
- Avoid absent letters (A, C, R, S, T).

### Chosen Guess: **OPINE**
- **O**: Tests position 1 (if correct, we get ✓; if misplaced, O must be in position 2).
- **P and I**: New common letters tested in positions 2 and 3.
- **NE**: Confirms fixed positions 4 and 5.
- **Valid word**: No absent letters, and fits the pattern.

This guess efficiently narrows down the location of O while probing new letters.",Guess 3: opine -> FEEDBACK: O(✓) P(✓) I(✓) N(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
