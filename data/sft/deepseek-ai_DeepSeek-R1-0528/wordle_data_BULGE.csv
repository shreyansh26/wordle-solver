Alright, let's start this Wordle game. As the first guess, I need to choose a 5-letter English word. Since there are no prior clues, I should pick a word that uses common letters to maximize the information I get from the feedback.

Common vowels in English are A, E, I, O, U. For consonants, letters like R, S, T, L, N are frequent. A word that includes several of these might help reveal more about the secret word.

I recall that ""CRANE"" is often recommended as a good starting word because it contains common letters: C, R, A, N, E. Among these, A and E are vowels, and R and N are common consonants. Also, C is fairly common. This should provide useful feedback.

Alternative choices could be ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", or ""STARE"". However, ""CRANE"" seems solid. It has a good mix of vowels and consonants, and it doesn't repeat letters, which is efficient for gathering information.

So, I'll go with ""CRANE"" as the first guess.

We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"": C(x R(x A(x N(x E(✓)
 This means:
   C is not in the secret word.
   R is not in the secret word.
   A is not in the secret word.
   N is not in the secret word.
   E is in the secret word but the position is not known (the feedback shows a checkmark for E, which actually means E is in the word and in the correct position? Wait, let me clarify the feedback symbols).

 But note: The example feedback uses:
   ✓ for correct letter in correct position.
   - for correct letter in wrong position.
   x for not in the word.

 In the given feedback for ""crane"": 
   C(x) -> C not in word
   R(x) -> R not in word
   A(x) -> A not in word
   N(x) -> N not in word
   E(✓) -> E is in the word and in the correct position.

 So the secret word has E as the 5th letter? Because in ""crane"", the E is the last letter. So the secret word ends with E.

 Therefore, we know:
   The secret word must be of the form: ???E?
   Actually, the positions: the word has 5 letters. In ""crane"", the E is the 5th letter. So the secret word has E in the 5th position.

 Also, we know that C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

 So the secret word has the last letter E, and does not contain C, R, A, N.

 Now, we need to make a second guess.

 We must choose a 5-letter word that:
   - Ends with E? Not necessarily, but we can use the E in the 5th position again? Actually, we can put E in different positions to check if it appears elsewhere? But wait, the feedback for E was a checkmark meaning it's in the correct position (the fifth). So we know for sure the fifth letter is E.

 Actually, let me read the rules again: 
   ✓: letter in the word and in the CORRECT position.

 So the E is confirmed in the fifth position. Therefore, in our next guess, we might not need to change the E, but we can use that fifth slot as E.

 But note: we are allowed to put E in other positions? However, if we put E in the fifth position again, we know it will be a check. If we put E in another position, then we can check if there are multiple E's? But note the previous feedback: only the fifth position was marked. However, since the word has only one E? Not necessarily, but we only got one check. But if there were another E, and it wasn't in the position we guessed (the first guess had E only at the end) then we couldn't tell. Actually, the feedback shows for each letter independently.

 However, we also know that the feedback doesn't account for multiple occurrences? Typically in Wordle, if the word has two E's, and you guess one E in the correct position and another E in a wrong position (or a different E in a wrong position) then you would get a check for the correct one and a minus for the other? Or if the word has two E's and you guess two E's, then both would get marked appropriately.

 But in our case, the first guess only had one E. So we don't know if there are multiple E's.

 For now, we know that the fifth letter is E, and that C, R, A, N are absent.

 So the secret word is: [letter1][letter2][letter3][letter4]E

 And the letters C, R, A, N are not present.

 We should choose a word that:
   - Has E at the end? Actually, we can choose any word, but to get more information, we might want to put E at the end to confirm it again? Actually, we don't need to confirm it because it's already known to be in position 5. So we can focus on the other positions.

 However, if we choose a word that doesn't have E at the end, then the fifth letter would be different and we would get an x for that fifth letter? But we know the fifth letter must be E. Therefore, we must keep E at the fifth position? Actually, no. We can test a word that does not have E at the end, but then the feedback would show that the fifth letter of the guess is compared to E? And if it's not E, we'd get an x for that letter. But we are sure that the fifth letter is E so it would waste an opportunity to learn about other positions.

 Therefore, for the second guess, I think it's wise to keep the known letter E at the fifth position. So the guess must be of the form: ???E

 Moreover, we need to avoid letters C, R, A, N.

 We are trying to discover letters that are present and their positions.

 Common letters that are not C, R, A, N: we have many. We can use common letters like S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

 A good candidate might be ""SLATE"", but note: A and T are in ""SLATE"" but:
   - A was already ruled out: in the first guess, A was given x, so A is not in the word. Therefore, we cannot use A.
   Similarly, R and N are out.

 So we must choose a word that:
   - Has E at the end.
   - Uses other common letters that are not C, R, A, N.

 Examples: 
   ""SPIKE"": has S, P, I, K, E? But E is at the end? And avoid A, R, N, C? Yes.
   However, we don't know about S, P, I, K.

 But note: the word ""SLATE"" is not good because it contains A (ruled out) and T? T isn't ruled out yet? Actually, in the first guess we didn't test T.

 However, we know A is not in the word. So we must avoid A.

 Another example: ""STOLE"": has S, T, O, L, E. E at the end. It avoids C, R, A, N? Yes, no A, R, N, C.

 But what about letters we haven't tested? We haven't tested S, T, O, L. So if we use ""STOLE"", we test four new letters.

 Another candidate: ""HOUSE"": has H, O, U, S, E. Again, avoids the forbidden letters.

 However, we might prefer words with more common vowels? The secret word has only one vowel revealed (E) and we don't have any vowels yet because A was excluded. The vowels we have left are: I, O, U? Also, Y might be a vowel.

 But note: the secret word must have vowels. So we can try to include other vowels to test.

 Alternatively, we might consider ""POISE"": P, O, I, S, E? But that has O and I.

 Another common starting word for second guesses is ""PIOUS"", but note we need E at the end.

 Actually, we need a word ending in E. So we can build one.

 Possibilities: 
   words ending with E: many.

 Let me think of a word that uses common letters and ends with E: 
   ""TIMES"": T, I, M, E, S? Ends with E? Actually, ""TIMES"" = T,I,M,E,S -> last letter E? Yes. But note: the fifth letter is E, so the fifth position is E. Therefore, in ""TIMES"", the E is in the fifth position? Yes: T (1), I (2), M (3), E (4)? Wait, no: 
   T-I-M-E-S? That's 5 letters: 
      position1: T
      position2: I
      position3: M
      position4: E -> but wait, that's only 4 letters? Actually ""TIMES"" is spelled T-I-M-E-S? Actually, it's 5: T, I, M, E, S? 
   But in the word ""TIMES"", the fourth letter is E and the fifth letter is S? So that doesn't end with E.

 Correction: I made a mistake. The word ""TIMES"" does not end in E? It ends in S. Words ending in E: 
   ""OPINE"": O, P, I, N, E -> but note: N was ruled out. So we cannot use N.

 We must avoid N.

 Let me think: 
   ""TOWEL"": T, O, W, E, L -> but that has E at the fourth letter? And the fifth is L? No. 
   We need the fifth letter to be E. So the word must be in the pattern: [letter][letter][letter][letter]E.

 Examples: 
   ""STOVE"": S, T, O, V, E -> ends with E. 
   ""HIVE"": but that's only 4 letters? So we need 5-letters: ""SHIVE"", ""STIVE"", etc. but let me think common words.

 Common words: 
   ""LOUSE"": L, O, U, S, E -> ends with E? Yes. And avoids C, R, A, N? Yes. It tests L, O, U, S.
   ""MOUSE"": M, O, U, S, E -> same thing.

 But note: O and U are vowels. 

 Alternatively, ""SUITE"": S, U, I, T, E -> ends with E? Yes. And tests S, U, I, T.

 I think ""SUITE"" is a good choice because it has three vowels (if we count U and I) and S and T are common.

 However, is ""SUITE"" a valid word? Yes.

 Let me check: SUITE is a 5-letter word meaning a set of rooms, etc.

 We haven't tested: S, U, I, T. So this guess will give us feedback for these four and then the last (E) we know is already correct.

 But note: we know the fifth position will be E, so we'll get a ✓ for E regardless? And we focus on the others.

 We can also consider ""PIXIE"" but has X which is less common? And ends with E? Actually, ""PIXIE"" ends with E but it has P, I, X, I, E -> but it repeats I? Not ideal because we want to test multiple distinct letters.

 Therefore, I'll go with ""SUITE"".

 But let's think about the possibility of having the same letter appear multiple times? The feedback might give us clues. However, in ""SUITE"", all letters are distinct.

 So second guess: SUITE

 Expected pattern: [letter][letter][letter][letter]E -> the guess is S, U, I, T, E.

 We'll get feedback on S, U, I, T and for E we know will be ✓.

 But note: what if the word has another E? We don't know. But for now, we'll see.

 Alternatively, we could use ""LIGHT"" but does not end with E? Then we would get an incorrect fifth letter? Which we avoid because we know the fifth is E. So we must keep E at the end.

 Therefore, the guess is ""SUITE"".

<guess>suite</guess>
</think>
After reviewing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and N are absent (all marked ""x"")
- E is present and in the correct position (5th letter, marked ""✓"")

Given this:
1. The secret word ends with ""E"" (format: ???E).
2. Letters C, R, A, and N are eliminated.
3. The second guess should retain ""E"" in the 5th position to confirm we understand the pattern and test new common letters.
4. New letters should avoid eliminated letters and focus on high-frequency consonants.

A strong second guess is **""SUITE""**:
- Position: S, U, I, T, E  
- Tests new letters: S, U, I, T  
- Retains ""E"" in 5th position  
- Avoids forbidden letters (C/R/A/N)  
- Uses common vowels (U, I) and consonants (S, T)  

This maximizes feedback potential for remaining positions.

 Expected pattern: [letter][letter][letter][letter]E -> the guess is S, U, I, T, E.

 We'll get feedback on S, U, I, T and for E we know will be ✓.

 But note: what if the word has another E? We don't know. But for now, we'll see.

 Alternatively, we could use ""LIGHT"" but does not end with E? Then we would get an incorrect fifth letter? Which we avoid because we know the fifth is E. So we must keep E at the end.

 Therefore, the guess is ""SUITE"".

<guess>suite</guess>After reviewing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and N are absent (all marked ""x"")
- E is present and in the correct position (5th letter, marked ""✓"")

Given this:
1. The secret word ends with ""E"" (format: ???E).
2. Letters C, R, A, and N are eliminated.
3. The second guess should retain ""E"" in the 5th position to confirm we understand the pattern and test new common letters.
4. New letters should avoid eliminated letters and focus on high-frequency consonants.

A strong second guess is **""SUITE""**:
- Position: S, U, I, T, E  
- Tests new letters: S, U, I, T  
- Retains ""E"" in 5th position  
- Avoids forbidden letters (C/R/A/N)  
- Uses common vowels (U, I) and consonants (S, T)

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>Alright, let's start this Wordle game. As the first guess, I need to choose a 5-letter English word. Since there are no prior clues, I should pick a word that uses common letters to maximize the information I get from the feedback.

Common vowels in English are A, E, I, O, U. For consonants, letters like R, S, T, L, N are frequent. A word that includes several of these might help reveal more about the secret word.

I recall that ""CRANE"" is often recommended as a good starting word because it contains common letters: C, R, A, N, E. Among these, A and E are vowels, and R and N are common consonants. Also, C is fairly common. This should provide useful feedback.

Alternative choices could be ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", or ""STARE"". However, ""CRANE"" seems solid. It has a good mix of vowels and consonants, and it doesn't repeat letters, which is efficient for gathering information.

So, I'll go with ""CRANE"" as the first guess.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"": C(x R(x A(x N(x E(✓)
 This means:
   C is not in the secret word.
   R is not in the secret word.
   A is not in the secret word.
   N is not in the secret word.
   E is in the secret word but the position is not known (the feedback shows a checkmark for E, which actually means E is in the word and in the correct position? Wait, let me clarify the feedback symbols).

 But note: The example feedback uses:
   ✓ for correct letter in correct position.
   - for correct letter in wrong position.
   x for not in the word.

 In the given feedback for ""crane"": 
   C(x) -> C not in word
   R(x) -> R not in word
   A(x) -> A not in word
   N(x) -> N not in word
   E(✓) -> E is in the word and in the correct position.

 So the secret word has E as the 5th letter? Because in ""crane"", the E is the last letter. So the secret word ends with E.

 Therefore, we know:
   The secret word must be of the form: ???E?
   Actually, the positions: the word has 5 letters. In ""crane"", the E is the 5th letter. So the secret word has E in the 5th position.

 Also, we know that C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

 So the secret word has the last letter E, and does not contain C, R, A, N.

 Now, we need to make a second guess.

 We must choose a 5-letter word that:
   - Ends with E? Not necessarily, but we can use the E in the 5th position again? Actually, we can put E in different positions to check if it appears elsewhere? But wait, the feedback for E was a checkmark meaning it's in the correct position (the fifth). So we know for sure the fifth letter is E.

 Actually, let me read the rules again: 
   ✓: letter in the word and in the CORRECT position.

 So the E is confirmed in the fifth position. Therefore, in our next guess, we might not need to change the E, but we can use that fifth slot as E.

 But note: we are allowed to put E in other positions? However, if we put E in the fifth position again, we know it will be a check. If we put E in another position, then we can check if there are multiple E's? But note the previous feedback: only the fifth position was marked. However, since the word has only one E? Not necessarily, but we only got one check. But if there were another E, and it wasn't in the position we guessed (the first guess had E only at the end) then we couldn't tell. Actually, the feedback shows for each letter independently.

 However, we also know that the feedback doesn't account for multiple occurrences? Typically in Wordle, if the word has two E's, and you guess one E in the correct position and another E in a wrong position (or a different E in a wrong position) then you would get a check for the correct one and a minus for the other? Or if the word has two E's and you guess two E's, then both would get marked appropriately.

 But in our case, the first guess only had one E. So we don't know if there are multiple E's.

 For now, we know that the fifth letter is E, and that C, R, A, N are absent.

 So the secret word is: [letter1][letter2][letter3][letter4]E

 And the letters C, R, A, N are not present.

 We should choose a word that:
   - Has E at the end? Actually, we can choose any word, but to get more information, we might want to put E at the end to confirm it again? Actually, we don't need to confirm it because it's already known to be in position 5. So we can focus on the other positions.

 However, if we choose a word that doesn't have E at the end, then the fifth letter would be different and we would get an x for that fifth letter? But we know the fifth letter must be E. Therefore, we must keep E at the fifth position? Actually, no. We can test a word that does not have E at the end, but then the feedback would show that the fifth letter of the guess is compared to E? And if it's not E, we'd get an x for that letter. But we are sure that the fifth letter is E so it would waste an opportunity to learn about other positions.

 Therefore, for the second guess, I think it's wise to keep the known letter E at the fifth position. So the guess must be of the form: ???E

 Moreover, we need to avoid letters C, R, A, N.

 We are trying to discover letters that are present and their positions.

 Common letters that are not C, R, A, N: we have many. We can use common letters like S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

 A good candidate might be ""SLATE"", but note: A and T are in ""SLATE"" but:
   - A was already ruled out: in the first guess, A was given x, so A is not in the word. Therefore, we cannot use A.
   Similarly, R and N are out.

 So we must choose a word that:
   - Has E at the end.
   - Uses other common letters that are not C, R, A, N.

 Examples: 
   ""SPIKE"": has S, P, I, K, E? But E is at the end? And avoid A, R, N, C? Yes.
   However, we don't know about S, P, I, K.

 But note: the word ""SLATE"" is not good because it contains A (ruled out) and T? T isn't ruled out yet? Actually, in the first guess we didn't test T.

 However, we know A is not in the word. So we must avoid A.

 Another example: ""STOLE"": has S, T, O, L, E. E at the end. It avoids C, R, A, N? Yes, no A, R, N, C.

 But what about letters we haven't tested? We haven't tested S, T, O, L. So if we use ""STOLE"", we test four new letters.

 Another candidate: ""HOUSE"": has H, O, U, S, E. Again, avoids the forbidden letters.

 However, we might prefer words with more common vowels? The secret word has only one vowel revealed (E) and we don't have any vowels yet because A was excluded. The vowels we have left are: I, O, U? Also, Y might be a vowel.

 But note: the secret word must have vowels. So we can try to include other vowels to test.

 Alternatively, we might consider ""POISE"": P, O, I, S, E? But that has O and I.

 Another common starting word for second guesses is ""PIOUS"", but note we need E at the end.

 Actually, we need a word ending in E. So we can build one.

 Possibilities: 
   words ending with E: many.

 Let me think of a word that uses common letters and ends with E: 
   ""TIMES"": T, I, M, E, S? Ends with E? Actually, ""TIMES"" = T,I,M,E,S -> last letter E? Yes. But note: the fifth letter is E, so the fifth position is E. Therefore, in ""TIMES"", the E is in the fifth position? Yes: T (1), I (2), M (3), E (4)? Wait, no: 
   T-I-M-E-S? That's 5 letters: 
      position1: T
      position2: I
      position3: M
      position4: E -> but wait, that's only 4 letters? Actually ""TIMES"" is spelled T-I-M-E-S? Actually, it's 5: T, I, M, E, S? 
   But in the word ""TIMES"", the fourth letter is E and the fifth letter is S? So that doesn't end with E.

 Correction: I made a mistake. The word ""TIMES"" does not end in E? It ends in S. Words ending in E: 
   ""OPINE"": O, P, I, N, E -> but note: N was ruled out. So we cannot use N.

 We must avoid N.

 Let me think: 
   ""TOWEL"": T, O, W, E, L -> but that has E at the fourth letter? And the fifth is L? No. 
   We need the fifth letter to be E. So the word must be in the pattern: [letter][letter][letter][letter]E.

 Examples: 
   ""STOVE"": S, T, O, V, E -> ends with E. 
   ""HIVE"": but that's only 4 letters? So we need 5-letters: ""SHIVE"", ""STIVE"", etc. but let me think common words.

 Common words: 
   ""LOUSE"": L, O, U, S, E -> ends with E? Yes. And avoids C, R, A, N? Yes. It tests L, O, U, S.
   ""MOUSE"": M, O, U, S, E -> same thing.

 But note: O and U are vowels. 

 Alternatively, ""SUITE"": S, U, I, T, E -> ends with E? Yes. And tests S, U, I, T.

 I think ""SUITE"" is a good choice because it has three vowels (if we count U and I) and S and T are common.

 However, is ""SUITE"" a valid word? Yes.

 Let me check: SUITE is a 5-letter word meaning a set of rooms, etc.

 We haven't tested: S, U, I, T. So this guess will give us feedback for these four and then the last (E) we know is already correct.

 But note: we know the fifth position will be E, so we'll get a ✓ for E regardless? And we focus on the others.

 We can also consider ""PIXIE"" but has X which is less common? And ends with E? Actually, ""PIXIE"" ends with E but it has P, I, X, I, E -> but it repeats I? Not ideal because we want to test multiple distinct letters.

 Therefore, I'll go with ""SUITE"".

 But let's think about the possibility of having the same letter appear multiple times? The feedback might give us clues. However, in ""SUITE"", all letters are distinct.

 So second guess: SUITE

 Expected pattern: [letter][letter][letter][letter]E -> the guess is S, U, I, T, E.

 We'll get feedback on S, U, I, T and for E we know will be ✓.

 But note: what if the word has another E? We don't know. But for now, we'll see.

 Alternatively, we could use ""LIGHT"" but does not end with E? Then we would get an incorrect fifth letter? Which we avoid because we know the fifth is E. So we must keep E at the end.

 Therefore, the guess is ""SUITE"".

<guess>suite</guess>After reviewing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and N are absent (all marked ""x"")
- E is present and in the correct position (5th letter, marked ""✓"")

Given this:
1. The secret word ends with ""E"" (format: ???E).
2. Letters C, R, A, and N are eliminated.
3. The second guess should retain ""E"" in the 5th position to confirm we understand the pattern and test new common letters.
4. New letters should avoid eliminated letters and focus on high-frequency consonants.

A strong second guess is **""SUITE""**:
- Position: S, U, I, T, E  
- Tests new letters: S, U, I, T  
- Retains ""E"" in 5th position  
- Avoids forbidden letters (C/R/A/N)  
- Uses common vowels (U, I) and consonants (S, T)  

This maximizes feedback potential for remaining positions.

- N is not in the word.
- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).

So the secret word has E as the 5th letter, and does not contain C, R, A, N.

Guess 2: suite -> Feedback: S(x) U(✓) I(x) T(x) E(✓)
Meaning:
- S is not in the word.
- U is in the word and in the correct position (which is the 2nd position because in ""suite"", U is the 2nd letter).
- I is not in the word.
- T is not in the word.
- E is in the correct position (5th letter, which we already knew).

Therefore, the U is in the 2nd position and is part of the word.

So now we know:
- The secret word is of the form: _ U _ _ E
- The 2nd letter is U, and the 5th letter is E.
- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, I, T (and also C, R, A, N, S, I, T are confirmed not in the word).

Moreover, since U is in the 2nd position and E in the 5th, we have: [letter1] U [letter3] [letter4] E

We need to find such a 5-letter word.

Available letters: We have eliminated C,R,A,N,S,I,T. Common letters left might include O, L, D, P, M, G, H, B, etc.

Potential words: We must form words that fit the pattern _ U _ _ E.

Let's think of possibilities:
- Words ending with E, with U as the 2nd letter? And avoiding the forbidden letters.

Examples:
- ""PLUME"": P L U M E -> fits _ U _ _ E? Positions: P, L, U, M, E? Actually, if the pattern is letter1, U, letter3, letter4, E then for ""PLUME"": 
    Position1: P
    Position2: L -> but we have U in position2? Wait, no: ""PLUME"" is P-L-U-M-E, so:
        Pos1: P
        Pos2: L
        Pos3: U -> which is not position2. So it doesn't match our pattern.

We need the second letter to be U. So the pattern is:
Pos1: any letter (not C,R,A,N,S,I,T)
Pos2: U
Pos3: any letter (not C,R,A,N,S,I,T)
Pos4: any letter (not C,R,A,N,S,I,T)
Pos5: E

Now, let me think of words that have U as second letter and end in E.

Common words:
- ""QUOTE"": Q U O T E -> 
    This avoids C,R,A,N,S,I,T? But note: Q is not in the forbidden list? Also O and T: T is forbidden? Previously in the second guess feedback, T was marked x? So T is absent. Thus we cannot use T. Therefore, ""QUOTE"" has T -> invalid.

- ""ROUSE"": R U O S E -> but R is forbidden (first feedback) and S is forbidden? So not allowed.

- ""MOUSE"": M U O S E -> S is forbidden? From guess2 we have S(x) -> so S is not in the word? Thus we cannot use S.

Other words:
- ""DOUSE"": D U O S E -> S is forbidden? Same problem.

What about: ""JOULE""? J U O L E -> 
    Letters: J, U, O, L, E. 
    J is not forbidden? O, L are also not forbidden? So possible? And T,S not used.

But is ""JOULE"" a common word? It might be acceptable.

But let me look for more common ones.

Another: ""COUDE"" -> but C is forbidden? Not allowed.

""LOUIE"": L U I E? I is forbidden -> guess2 feedback: I(x) -> so I is absent? Thus we cannot use I.

Therefore, avoid I.

""GOUGE"": G U U G E -> repeated U? But the pattern would be? It's G-O-U-G-E? Wait, no: ""GOUGE"" is G-O-U-G-E, so:
   Pos1: G
   Pos2: O -> not U? So no.

We need exactly U in position2.

Another possibility: ""PUBES""? But that word might be sensitive? And contains P,U,B,E,S -> S is forbidden.

""PUDGE"": P U D G E -> 
    Letters: P, U, D, G, E.
    Check forbidden letters: P, D, G are not forbidden? Also doesn't use C,R,A,N,S,I,T? 
    So it fits the pattern: P (pos1), U (pos2), D (pos3), G (pos4), E (pos5).
    Is ""PUDGE"" a valid word? It means a short person, but accepted in Wordle? Probably.

But let me think of other options.

""BULGE"": B U L G E -> 
   Pos1: B
   Pos2: U
   Pos3: L
   Pos4: G
   Pos5: E
   Letters: B, U, L, G, E -> none forbidden? So also a candidate.

Similarly, ""FUDGE"": F U D G E -> 
   F, U, D, G, E -> forbidden? Only F is new? Allowed.

But note: in our forbidden list, we also have the letters C,R,A,N,S,I,T. None of these appear in BULGE or FUDGE or PUDGE.

But also possible: ""DUNGE"" -> wait, D U N G E? Wait, N is forbidden? No, in guess1: N(x) -> so N is absent? Therefore ""DUNGE"" is no good.

Alternatively, ""HUMOR"": Doesn't end in E? We need E at the end.

Another: ""MUSED"": M U S E D? S is forbidden? So invalid.

How common is ""PUDGE""? Maybe we should choose a more common word.

Other words: ""PUREE"": P U R E E -> but R is forbidden? Yes, R(x) in guess1? So R cannot be used? Therefore ""PUREE"" is invalid.

""JUMBO"": Doesn't end in E? No.

Perhaps ""BUDGE"": B U D G E -> same as FUDGE but with B.

Wait, is ""BUDGE"" a word? Yes, meaning to move. Similarly ""FUDGE"" is common.

Also, ""PULSE"": P U L S E -> S is forbidden? Not allowed.

""VOULU"": Doesn't end in E.

The available words I can think of are: BULGE, FUDGE, PUDGE.

Perhaps ""FUGUE"": F U G U E? Wait, ""FUGUE"" is F-U-G-U-E? That has two U's. Pattern: letter1=F, U at position2? Good. Then position3=G, position4=U? Wait, then position5=E? 
But it has U again at position4? And the secret word might have U only once? Or multiple? We don't know.

The feedback for guess2: U is present and in position2? But if we use ""FUGUE"", we test U again at position4? That might be useful? Since the secret word might have U only once? Or twice?

However, note our pattern: we know U is in position2? If the secret word had a U in position4, then when we guessed ""suite"" (with U only at position2) we would have seen one U marked with ✓. But if there were another U, we didn't guess it so we didn't get feedback? So it's possible? Therefore we must consider.

But to keep it simple, I'll pick one.

But note: we only have one U? We don't know. But in the feedback, the ✓ for U means that U at that position is correct? And if there were another U, we wouldn't know.

Therefore, for the next guess, we can test a word that has U only in position2? Or even in position2 and try to cover other possibilities? We can also avoid U in other positions to see if the word has U only once? But it's tricky.

However, we are required to guess a valid English word? And we are constrained by the pattern: _ U _ _ E? And the forbidden letters.

I think BULGE, FUDGE, PUDGE are valid. Let me choose ""BULGE"" or ""FUDGE"".

But note: in ""BULGE"": B,U,L,G,E? Letter L? We haven't tested L? Similarly in ""FUDGE"": F,D,G?

We need to test more letters? Actually, since we have to start narrowing, we can pick one.

Consider that we have 4 more guesses? So we can choose a word that matches the pattern? Or we can choose a word that tests more letters? But since the pattern is fixed (positions 2 and 5) and letters in positions 1,3,4 must be from the remaining set? We can choose a word that uses common remaining letters? Even if we guess correctly, if we get the word? But if not we learn.

But let me think about remaining letters to test? We might want to maximize information.

Common letters left: perhaps L, D, M, O, P, G.

For example: ""PLUME"" does not fit because U is not at position2.

Another idea: ""UMBRA"" but doesn't end in E? And has A? A is forbidden? Also no E.

Back to the pattern: _ U _ _ E? So we need 5-letter words with U at second and E at last.

Perhaps ""GULAG""? Ends with G? Not E.

""LUCRE"": L U C R E? But C and R are forbidden? So not allowed.

So ""BULGE"", ""FUDGE"", and ""PUDGE"" are among the few.

Another word: ""HUMOR"" doesn't end in E? How about ""HUMAN""? Ends with N? And N is forbidden? Also doesn't end in E.

""PURGE"": P U R G E? R is forbidden? So invalid.

""DELUXE"": D E L U X E -> 6 letters? Or ""LUXE"" is 4? So not 5.

Therefore, our choices are limited? 

Now, let me check which letters we haven't tested? We might test letters that are common? To eliminate possibilities? Even if we guess a word in the pattern, if it's not correct, we get feedback that helps us narrow the letters.

For example, if I choose ""BULGE"":
    Pos1: B
    Pos2: U (we know U is correct position? So ✓ already)
    Pos3: L
    Pos4: G
    Pos5: E (✓)

Therefore, we'll see feedback for L and G? And also B? Which we haven't tested before.

Similarly, for ""FUDGE"": testing F, D, G.

Now, which common letters should we test? We may choose a word to test letters? But since we are constrained? Alternatively, we can choose a word that has letters we can test? 

But note: We have eliminated more letters? So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z ...? 

Perhaps L and G are common? Similarly D and F? 

But I think ""BULGE"" is a reasonable option? Similarly ""FUDGE"".

I choose ""FUDGE""? Or to test more vowels? We haven't tested O? So a word like ...? But for pattern _ U _ _ E, we might need vowels? But position3 and position4 are arbitrary? They could be consonants? 

There is ""POUCE""? Doesn't end in E? Or ""JOUSE""? Has S? Forbidden? 

Another word: ""GOUJE?"" Not a word? Or ""MOULE""? But ends in E? ""MOULE"": M U O L E? 
   Pattern: M at pos1, U pos2, O at pos3, L at pos4, E at pos5? So that fits? And avoids forbidden? 
   Letters: M, O, L, E? Not forbidden? And E we know? Also U? 
   So ""MOULE""? Is it valid? Meaning: a mould? Or a French term? But English dictionaries? Might be accepted.

Also ""POULE""? P O U L E? But U is at position3? Not position2? 

No: pattern requires U at position2? So ""MOULE"" is M-O-U-L-E? 
   Actually, ""MOULE"": 
      Position1: M
      Position2: O -> not U? So no.

Spelling: M O U L E? Then U is at position3? So it doesn't fit.

The only common words I find are ""FUDGE"" and ""BULGE"".

Therefore, I choose ""FUDGE""? Or ""BUDGE""? ""BUDGE"" is also valid? B U D G E? Same.

Perhaps ""DUDGE""? Not common? Or ""JUDGE"": J U D G E? 
   J at pos1, U at pos2, D at pos3, G at pos4, E at pos5? 
   Letters: J, U, D, G, E? Not forbidden? And J is available? So ""JUDGE"" is a common word? 

Now decided: We can use ""JUDGE"" or ""FUDGE"". 

I think ""JUDGE"" includes J? Which is less common? So perhaps ""FUDGE"" is better? But we want to test possible letters? 

Since we don't know? We'll learn from the feedback.

Another candidate: ""POOVE""? Not ending in E? 

So I'll go with ""FUDGE"".

But note: if the word is ""FUDGE"", we win? If not, we get feedback on F, D, G? Which is helpful.

Similarly, if we choose ""BULGE"", we test B, L, G.

Perhaps choose one? Let's say ""FUDGE"".

After ""suite"" feedback: 
   positions: 
      1: S(x) -> so we know position1 must be a letter not tested? Now we know position1 is not S? And we are going to test F at position1? 

So second guess: ""suite"" was S,U,I,T,E? 
   Position1: S -> x? so incorrect and not present? But we already know S is absent? So we don't need to test that?

Actually, we know S is absent? So we can use F? Because if we use F? And if the secret word has F at position1? Then we'll get ✓? Or not? But if it doesn't, we'll get x? 

Similarly for B? Etc.

Therefore, I think either word is acceptable? 

I will choose ""BULGE"" because it uses L? Which is common? Maybe more common than D and F? 

But let me see frequency: L is very common? F and D are also common? 

Yes, L is more common than F and D? 

Alternatively, ""DOUSE""? No, S is present? Forbidden? 

Therefore, I decide: ""BULGE""

<guess>bulge</guess>
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:
- From ""crane"": E is in the 5th position (✓), and C, R, A, N are absent (x).
- From ""suite"": U is in the 2nd position (✓), and S, I, T are absent (x). E is confirmed in the 5th position again (✓).

### Key Insights:
1. **Pattern**: The secret word must follow the pattern `_ U _ _ E`.
2. **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, S, I, T cannot appear in the word.
3. **Constraints**: The word must be a valid 5-letter English word ending with E, with U in the 2nd position, and excluding the above letters.

### Thought Process:
- **Available letters**: Common remaining consonants (like B, D, G, L, M, P) and vowels (O) are candidates for positions 1, 3, and 4.
- **Possible words**: Words fitting `_ U _ _ E` include:  
  - BULGE (B, U, L, G, E)  
  - FUDGE (F, U, D, G, E)  
  - PUDGE (P, U, D, G, E)  
  - JUDGE (J, U, D, G, E)  
- **Strategy**: Choose ""BULGE"" to test common letters:  
  - B (new, untested) in position 1.  
  - L (new, untested) in position 3.  
  - G (new, untested) in position 4.  
  - U and E positions are already confirmed.  
This guess maximizes feedback on new, high-frequency letters (especially L, which is top-10 in English) while adhering to the pattern.

<guess>bulge</guess>",bulge,"We have received feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Meaning:
- C is not in the word.
- R is not in the word.
- A is not in the word.
- N is not in the word.
- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).

So the secret word has E as the 5th letter, and does not contain C, R, A, N.

Guess 2: suite -> Feedback: S(x) U(✓) I(x) T(x) E(✓)
Meaning:
- S is not in the word.
- U is in the word and in the correct position (which is the 2nd position because in ""suite"", U is the 2nd letter).
- I is not in the word.
- T is not in the word.
- E is in the correct position (5th letter, which we already knew).

Therefore, the U is in the 2nd position and is part of the word.

So now we know:
- The secret word is of the form: _ U _ _ E
- The 2nd letter is U, and the 5th letter is E.
- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, I, T (and also C, R, A, N, S, I, T are confirmed not in the word).

Moreover, since U is in the 2nd position and E in the 5th, we have: [letter1] U [letter3] [letter4] E

We need to find such a 5-letter word.

Available letters: We have eliminated C,R,A,N,S,I,T. Common letters left might include O, L, D, P, M, G, H, B, etc.

Potential words: We must form words that fit the pattern _ U _ _ E.

Let's think of possibilities:
- Words ending with E, with U as the 2nd letter? And avoiding the forbidden letters.

Examples:
- ""PLUME"": P L U M E -> fits _ U _ _ E? Positions: P, L, U, M, E? Actually, if the pattern is letter1, U, letter3, letter4, E then for ""PLUME"": 
    Position1: P
    Position2: L -> but we have U in position2? Wait, no: ""PLUME"" is P-L-U-M-E, so:
        Pos1: P
        Pos2: L
        Pos3: U -> which is not position2. So it doesn't match our pattern.

We need the second letter to be U. So the pattern is:
Pos1: any letter (not C,R,A,N,S,I,T)
Pos2: U
Pos3: any letter (not C,R,A,N,S,I,T)
Pos4: any letter (not C,R,A,N,S,I,T)
Pos5: E

Now, let me think of words that have U as second letter and end in E.

Common words:
- ""QUOTE"": Q U O T E -> 
    This avoids C,R,A,N,S,I,T? But note: Q is not in the forbidden list? Also O and T: T is forbidden? Previously in the second guess feedback, T was marked x? So T is absent. Thus we cannot use T. Therefore, ""QUOTE"" has T -> invalid.

- ""ROUSE"": R U O S E -> but R is forbidden (first feedback) and S is forbidden? So not allowed.

- ""MOUSE"": M U O S E -> S is forbidden? From guess2 we have S(x) -> so S is not in the word? Thus we cannot use S.

Other words:
- ""DOUSE"": D U O S E -> S is forbidden? Same problem.

What about: ""JOULE""? J U O L E -> 
    Letters: J, U, O, L, E. 
    J is not forbidden? O, L are also not forbidden? So possible? And T,S not used.

But is ""JOULE"" a common word? It might be acceptable.

But let me look for more common ones.

Another: ""COUDE"" -> but C is forbidden? Not allowed.

""LOUIE"": L U I E? I is forbidden -> guess2 feedback: I(x) -> so I is absent? Thus we cannot use I.

Therefore, avoid I.

""GOUGE"": G U U G E -> repeated U? But the pattern would be? It's G-O-U-G-E? Wait, no: ""GOUGE"" is G-O-U-G-E, so:
   Pos1: G
   Pos2: O -> not U? So no.

We need exactly U in position2.

Another possibility: ""PUBES""? But that word might be sensitive? And contains P,U,B,E,S -> S is forbidden.

""PUDGE"": P U D G E -> 
    Letters: P, U, D, G, E.
    Check forbidden letters: P, D, G are not forbidden? Also doesn't use C,R,A,N,S,I,T? 
    So it fits the pattern: P (pos1), U (pos2), D (pos3), G (pos4), E (pos5).
    Is ""PUDGE"" a valid word? It means a short person, but accepted in Wordle? Probably.

But let me think of other options.

""BULGE"": B U L G E -> 
   Pos1: B
   Pos2: U
   Pos3: L
   Pos4: G
   Pos5: E
   Letters: B, U, L, G, E -> none forbidden? So also a candidate.

Similarly, ""FUDGE"": F U D G E -> 
   F, U, D, G, E -> forbidden? Only F is new? Allowed.

But note: in our forbidden list, we also have the letters C,R,A,N,S,I,T. None of these appear in BULGE or FUDGE or PUDGE.

But also possible: ""DUNGE"" -> wait, D U N G E? Wait, N is forbidden? No, in guess1: N(x) -> so N is absent? Therefore ""DUNGE"" is no good.

Alternatively, ""HUMOR"": Doesn't end in E? We need E at the end.

Another: ""MUSED"": M U S E D? S is forbidden? So invalid.

How common is ""PUDGE""? Maybe we should choose a more common word.

Other words: ""PUREE"": P U R E E -> but R is forbidden? Yes, R(x) in guess1? So R cannot be used? Therefore ""PUREE"" is invalid.

""JUMBO"": Doesn't end in E? No.

Perhaps ""BUDGE"": B U D G E -> same as FUDGE but with B.

Wait, is ""BUDGE"" a word? Yes, meaning to move. Similarly ""FUDGE"" is common.

Also, ""PULSE"": P U L S E -> S is forbidden? Not allowed.

""VOULU"": Doesn't end in E.

The available words I can think of are: BULGE, FUDGE, PUDGE.

Perhaps ""FUGUE"": F U G U E? Wait, ""FUGUE"" is F-U-G-U-E? That has two U's. Pattern: letter1=F, U at position2? Good. Then position3=G, position4=U? Wait, then position5=E? 
But it has U again at position4? And the secret word might have U only once? Or multiple? We don't know.

The feedback for guess2: U is present and in position2? But if we use ""FUGUE"", we test U again at position4? That might be useful? Since the secret word might have U only once? Or twice?

However, note our pattern: we know U is in position2? If the secret word had a U in position4, then when we guessed ""suite"" (with U only at position2) we would have seen one U marked with ✓. But if there were another U, we didn't guess it so we didn't get feedback? So it's possible? Therefore we must consider.

But to keep it simple, I'll pick one.

But note: we only have one U? We don't know. But in the feedback, the ✓ for U means that U at that position is correct? And if there were another U, we wouldn't know.

Therefore, for the next guess, we can test a word that has U only in position2? Or even in position2 and try to cover other possibilities? We can also avoid U in other positions to see if the word has U only once? But it's tricky.

However, we are required to guess a valid English word? And we are constrained by the pattern: _ U _ _ E? And the forbidden letters.

I think BULGE, FUDGE, PUDGE are valid. Let me choose ""BULGE"" or ""FUDGE"".

But note: in ""BULGE"": B,U,L,G,E? Letter L? We haven't tested L? Similarly in ""FUDGE"": F,D,G?

We need to test more letters? Actually, since we have to start narrowing, we can pick one.

Consider that we have 4 more guesses? So we can choose a word that matches the pattern? Or we can choose a word that tests more letters? But since the pattern is fixed (positions 2 and 5) and letters in positions 1,3,4 must be from the remaining set? We can choose a word that uses common remaining letters? Even if we guess correctly, if we get the word? But if not we learn.

But let me think about remaining letters to test? We might want to maximize information.

Common letters left: perhaps L, D, M, O, P, G.

For example: ""PLUME"" does not fit because U is not at position2.

Another idea: ""UMBRA"" but doesn't end in E? And has A? A is forbidden? Also no E.

Back to the pattern: _ U _ _ E? So we need 5-letter words with U at second and E at last.

Perhaps ""GULAG""? Ends with G? Not E.

""LUCRE"": L U C R E? But C and R are forbidden? So not allowed.

So ""BULGE"", ""FUDGE"", and ""PUDGE"" are among the few.

Another word: ""HUMOR"" doesn't end in E? How about ""HUMAN""? Ends with N? And N is forbidden? Also doesn't end in E.

""PURGE"": P U R G E? R is forbidden? So invalid.

""DELUXE"": D E L U X E -> 6 letters? Or ""LUXE"" is 4? So not 5.

Therefore, our choices are limited? 

Now, let me check which letters we haven't tested? We might test letters that are common? To eliminate possibilities? Even if we guess a word in the pattern, if it's not correct, we get feedback that helps us narrow the letters.

For example, if I choose ""BULGE"":
    Pos1: B
    Pos2: U (we know U is correct position? So ✓ already)
    Pos3: L
    Pos4: G
    Pos5: E (✓)

Therefore, we'll see feedback for L and G? And also B? Which we haven't tested before.

Similarly, for ""FUDGE"": testing F, D, G.

Now, which common letters should we test? We may choose a word to test letters? But since we are constrained? Alternatively, we can choose a word that has letters we can test? 

But note: We have eliminated more letters? So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z ...? 

Perhaps L and G are common? Similarly D and F? 

But I think ""BULGE"" is a reasonable option? Similarly ""FUDGE"".

I choose ""FUDGE""? Or to test more vowels? We haven't tested O? So a word like ...? But for pattern _ U _ _ E, we might need vowels? But position3 and position4 are arbitrary? They could be consonants? 

There is ""POUCE""? Doesn't end in E? Or ""JOUSE""? Has S? Forbidden? 

Another word: ""GOUJE?"" Not a word? Or ""MOULE""? But ends in E? ""MOULE"": M U O L E? 
   Pattern: M at pos1, U pos2, O at pos3, L at pos4, E at pos5? So that fits? And avoids forbidden? 
   Letters: M, O, L, E? Not forbidden? And E we know? Also U? 
   So ""MOULE""? Is it valid? Meaning: a mould? Or a French term? But English dictionaries? Might be accepted.

Also ""POULE""? P O U L E? But U is at position3? Not position2? 

No: pattern requires U at position2? So ""MOULE"" is M-O-U-L-E? 
   Actually, ""MOULE"": 
      Position1: M
      Position2: O -> not U? So no.

Spelling: M O U L E? Then U is at position3? So it doesn't fit.

The only common words I find are ""FUDGE"" and ""BULGE"".

Therefore, I choose ""FUDGE""? Or ""BUDGE""? ""BUDGE"" is also valid? B U D G E? Same.

Perhaps ""DUDGE""? Not common? Or ""JUDGE"": J U D G E? 
   J at pos1, U at pos2, D at pos3, G at pos4, E at pos5? 
   Letters: J, U, D, G, E? Not forbidden? And J is available? So ""JUDGE"" is a common word? 

Now decided: We can use ""JUDGE"" or ""FUDGE"". 

I think ""JUDGE"" includes J? Which is less common? So perhaps ""FUDGE"" is better? But we want to test possible letters? 

Since we don't know? We'll learn from the feedback.

Another candidate: ""POOVE""? Not ending in E? 

So I'll go with ""FUDGE"".

But note: if the word is ""FUDGE"", we win? If not, we get feedback on F, D, G? Which is helpful.

Similarly, if we choose ""BULGE"", we test B, L, G.

Perhaps choose one? Let's say ""FUDGE"".

After ""suite"" feedback: 
   positions: 
      1: S(x) -> so we know position1 must be a letter not tested? Now we know position1 is not S? And we are going to test F at position1? 

So second guess: ""suite"" was S,U,I,T,E? 
   Position1: S -> x? so incorrect and not present? But we already know S is absent? So we don't need to test that?

Actually, we know S is absent? So we can use F? Because if we use F? And if the secret word has F at position1? Then we'll get ✓? Or not? But if it doesn't, we'll get x? 

Similarly for B? Etc.

Therefore, I think either word is acceptable? 

I will choose ""BULGE"" because it uses L? Which is common? Maybe more common than D and F? 

But let me see frequency: L is very common? F and D are also common? 

Yes, L is more common than F and D? 

Alternatively, ""DOUSE""? No, S is present? Forbidden? 

Therefore, I decide: ""BULGE""

<guess>bulge</guess>Based on the previous feedback:
- From ""crane"": E is in the 5th position (✓), and C, R, A, N are absent (x).
- From ""suite"": U is in the 2nd position (✓), and S, I, T are absent (x). E is confirmed in the 5th position again (✓).

### Key Insights:
1. **Pattern**: The secret word must follow the pattern `_ U _ _ E`.
2. **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, S, I, T cannot appear in the word.
3. **Constraints**: The word must be a valid 5-letter English word ending with E, with U in the 2nd position, and excluding the above letters.

### Thought Process:
- **Available letters**: Common remaining consonants (like B, D, G, L, M, P) and vowels (O) are candidates for positions 1, 3, and 4.
- **Possible words**: Words fitting `_ U _ _ E` include:  
  - BULGE (B, U, L, G, E)  
  - FUDGE (F, U, D, G, E)  
  - PUDGE (P, U, D, G, E)  
  - JUDGE (J, U, D, G, E)  
- **Strategy**: Choose ""BULGE"" to test common letters:  
  - B (new, untested) in position 1.  
  - L (new, untested) in position 3.  
  - G (new, untested) in position 4.  
  - U and E positions are already confirmed.  
This guess maximizes feedback on new, high-frequency letters (especially L, which is top-10 in English) while adhering to the pattern.",Guess 3: bulge -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) U(✓) L(✓) G(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
