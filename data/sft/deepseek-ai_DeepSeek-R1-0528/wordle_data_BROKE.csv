We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback. We need to make an initial guess.
 Since the goal is to maximize information, we should choose a word that has common letters and a balanced set of vowels and consonants.
 Popular starting words in Wordle often include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose the word ""SLATE"". It has 5 distinct letters, including common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (S, L, T).

 However, note that the game rules require a valid 5-letter English word.

 Therefore, I will start with ""SLATE"".

I need to make my first guess in the Wordle game. Since there's no prior feedback, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain. The best initial guesses typically:
- Use common letters from the English language
- Include a mix of vowels and consonants
- Avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities

Good starter words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ROAST"" work well. I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it:
- Contains three common consonants (C, R, N)
- Includes two important vowels (A, E)
- Has all unique letters
- Covers frequent letter positions (like R often in position 2)

This will provide useful feedback markers for narrowing down the secret word.

We are given feedback on our first guess ""SLATE"":
- S: x (not in the word)
- L: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- T: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position, which is the 5th position)

So, we know:
1. The secret word ends with E (since E is in position 5 and correct).
2. The letters S, L, A, T are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, we must avoid using S, L, A, T in our next guess.

Since E is fixed at the end, we need to guess the first four letters.

Our next guess should:
- Have E as the last letter (5th position).
- Not contain S, L, A, T.
- Be a valid English word.

We also want to gain as much information as possible about the other letters. So we should try to include common letters that we haven't tested yet.

Common consonants we haven't used: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Common vowels: We know E is in the word (at the end). Other vowels: I, O, U (since A is out).

But note: E is the only vowel we have confirmed, but there might be others.

Given the constraints, let's think of words ending with E.

Some common words ending with E: 
- ...E, such as ""TABLE"" but T and A are out, so not.
We need words without S,L,A,T.

Examples:
- ""BRINE"" (B,R,I,N,E) - but we have E at the end.
- ""PRICE"" (P,R,I,C,E) - same.
- ""CRIME"" (C,R,I,M,E) - same.

But note: in the first guess, we didn't test R, I, C, etc. Let's choose a word that uses new letters.

Possible words ending with E and without forbidden letters:
- BRINE: B,R,I,N,E
- PRONE: P,R,O,N,E
- CRONE: C,R,O,N,E
- DRONE: D,R,O,N,E
- GRIME: G,R,I,M,E
- PRICE? P,R,I,C,E

We also note that since E is confirmed at the end, we can focus on the first four letters.

We haven't tested R, I, N, etc. Let's pick a word that uses common letters and multiple new ones.

I think ""BRINE"" is a good candidate: 
- B, R, I, N are all new letters, so we can test them.
- It ends with E.

Alternatively, ""CRIME"": C,R,I,M,E.

But note: we must be cautious because we have only one E and we know it's at the end, so we shouldn't put E elsewhere? The feedback says E is at the end, but it doesn't say that there isn't another E. However, since we used only one E and it was at the end and correct, we don't know if the word has more E's. But typically, we assume no duplicates until feedback suggests otherwise.

However, in our next guess, we can only have E at the end to avoid confusion? Actually, we can put E elsewhere if we suspect a double E, but since none of the other vowels were in the word (from first guess: A was not present, and we didn't test others), and E was only at the end, it's safer to assume no double E for now.

So, let's avoid having another E.

Therefore, words ending with E: BRINE, CRIME, PRONE, etc.

Let me consider ""BRINE"": 
- Positions: B in 1, R in 2, I in 3, N in 4, E in 5.

If we use ""BRINE"", we test B, R, I, N, and confirm E at the end.

Another option: ""PRICE"" (P,R,I,C,E) — C is a common letter.

Or ""PRIME"" (P,R,I,M,E).

Since we have limited tries, we need to cover more common letters.

The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, ... but T and A are out. So, O, I, N are good.

So ""PRONE"" has O and N.

I think I'll go with ""PRONE"": P,R,O,N,E.

Why?
- P, R, O, N are all new letters.
- It ends with E.
- Common letters: R, O, N are very common.

This will give us information about four new letters.

Let me verify: is ""PRONE"" a valid word? Yes.

So, next guess: PRONE.

We'll return: <guess>PRONE</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""SLATE"": 
- S, L, A, T are **not** in the secret word (all marked ""x"").
- E is in the word and **correctly positioned at the end** (5th letter).

This means:
- The secret word ends with E.
- The secret word does NOT contain S, L, A, or T.
- The first four letters of the secret word are unknown, but must be from the remaining alphabet (excluding S, L, A, T).

For the second guess:
- It must end with E to confirm or add information about the 5th position.
- It should avoid S, L, A, T entirely.
- It should use new, high-frequency letters to maximize information gain (e.g., common consonants like R, N, P, or vowels like O, I).

A strong choice is **PRONE**:
- Ends with E, aligning with the known 5th-position E.
- Tests new common letters: P, R, O, N (all not used in the first guess).
- Valid 5-letter English word.

This guess efficiently explores frequent letters and builds on the known E position.

- It should use new, high-frequency letters to maximize information gain (e.g., common consonants like R, N, P, or vowels like O, I).

A strong choice is **PRONE**:
- Ends with E, aligning with the known 5th-position E.
- Tests new common letters: P, R, O, N (all not used in the first guess).
- Valid 5-letter English word.

This guess efficiently explores frequent letters and builds on the known E position.

The feedback says E is at the end, but it doesn\'t say that there isn\'t another E. However, since we used only one E and it was at the end and correct, we don\'t know if the word has more E\'s. But typically, we assume no duplicates until feedback suggests otherwise.\n\nHowever, in our next guess, we can only have E at the end to avoid confusion? Actually, we can put E elsewhere if we suspect a double E, but since none of the other vowels were in the word (from first guess: A was not present, and we didn\'t test others), and E was only at the end, it\'s safer to assume no double E for now.\n\nSo, let\'s avoid having another E.\n\nTherefore, words ending with E: BRINE, CRIME, PRONE, etc.\n\nLet me consider ""BRINE"": \n- Positions: B in 1, R in 2, I in 3, N in 4, E in 5.\n\nIf we use ""BRINE"", we test B, R, I, N, and confirm E at the end.\n\nAnother option: ""PRICE"" (P,R,I,C,E) — C is a common letter.\n\nOr ""PRIME"" (P,R,I,M,E).\n\nSince we have limited tries, we need to cover more common letters.\n\nThe most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, ... but T and A are out.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: SLATE -> S(x), L(x), A(x), T(x), E(✓)
This means:
- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th).
- S, L, A, T are not in the word.

Guess 2: PRONE -> P(x), R(✓), O(✓), N(x), E(✓)
This means:
- R and O are in the word and in the correct positions? Let's see the feedback: R(✓) and O(✓) mean they are correct and in the right positions. Also E(✓) is again correct in position 5.
- P and N are not in the word.

But note: the feedback for PRONE: 
  P (position 1): x -> not in word
  R (position 2): ✓ -> correct and in position 2
  O (position 3): ✓ -> correct and in position 3
  N (position 4): x -> not in word
  E (position 5): ✓ -> correct and in position 5

So, we know:
- The secret word has the following pattern: _ R O _ E
- The letters that are not in the word: S, L, A, T, P, N (from both guesses)

We also know that the word must be of the form: [letter1] R O [letter4] E

And we know that letter1 and letter4 cannot be S, L, A, T, P, N.

Moreover, we have used the letters: S, L, A, T, E, P, R, O, N (from the two guesses). But R, O, E are in the word, so we don't need to avoid them? Actually, we can reuse them if necessary, but since they are already known, it's better to test new letters.

But note: the word has only 5 letters, and we already know 3 of them: positions 2,3,5 are R, O, E. So we only need to find the first and fourth letters.

We must avoid the letters that are not in the word: S, L, A, T, P, N.

Available letters: all letters except S, L, A, T, P, N and the ones we know are in the word (R, O, E). But R, O, E are already placed, so for the missing positions, we can use any letter not excluded, but note that the word might have duplicate letters? However, we have no evidence of duplicates so far, so we assume no duplicates until contradicted.

Therefore, for position 1 and 4, we need to choose from the remaining alphabet, excluding: S, L, A, T, P, N, and also excluding R, O, E (because they are already in the word and we assume no duplicates?).

But wait: the feedback doesn't tell us if there are duplicates. For example, the word could have two R's? But in our first guess, we had only one R (in PRONE) and it was in position 2. We don't know if there is another R. Similarly for O and E. However, since we have no indication of duplicates, and to be efficient, we can assume no duplicates for now.

So, we assume the secret word has distinct letters. Therefore, for position 1 and 4, we must choose letters that are not in {S, L, A, T, P, N, R, O, E}.

Now, what are the common letters left? Let's list the alphabet:

A to Z, excluding: A, E, L, N, O, P, R, S, T.

So excluded: A, E, L, N, O, P, R, S, T.

Available: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a word of the form: [letter1] R O [letter4] E

We need to find a valid English word that fits: _ R O _ E, with the two blanks being two distinct letters from the available set.

Common words that fit this pattern? Let's think:

- PROSE? But P and S are excluded.
- ROUTE? R is already used, and we are assuming no duplicates? Also, R is in position 1? But our pattern is _ R O _ E, so the first letter is not R. ROUTE has R in position 1, which would be a duplicate? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, in ROUTE, the R is in position 1, but we have R in position 2, so that would be two R's? We don't have evidence against duplicates, but let's avoid for now.

We should consider words without duplicates from the excluded set.

Possible words:

- GROVE: G is available, V is available? Pattern: G R O V E -> but then the fourth letter is V. Is that a word? Yes, GROVE. But we have to check if G and V are available: yes, they are in the available set.

But wait, in GROVE, the fourth letter is V, so the word is G R O V E. That fits the pattern.

But we have to check if we have excluded any of these: G, R, O, V, E. R, O, E are already known to be in the word, but we are using them again? In the pattern, we know positions 2,3,5 are fixed as R, O, E. So in GROVE, we have:
  position1: G
  position2: R (matches)
  position3: O (matches)
  position4: V
  position5: E (matches)

So it fits. And G and V are not excluded.

But we haven't tested G and V yet, so we don't know if they are in the word. This guess would test G and V.

Another possibility: BROME? But B is available, M is available. BROME is a word? Actually, BROME is not a common word. Brome is a type of grass, but let's stick to common words.

GROVE is a common word.

Other options: 
- FROZE: F and Z are available. FROZE: F R O Z E -> fits. But Z is less common.
- CROME? Not a word.
- DROVE: D and V. D is available. DROVE is a common word.

So DROVE: D R O V E.

We have two options: GROVE and DROVE.

Which one to choose? We want to maximize information. But note, we are only missing two letters, and we are testing two new letters in either case.

But we have to consider that if we guess one of these, and it's not the word, we get feedback on the two new letters.

However, we have only 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We might get it right.

But let's see: we know the word is ?R O ? E, and we have two possibilities? Actually, there are more.

We should list possible words to see how many there are.

Possible words with pattern _ R O _ E, using letters from available set and no duplicates (and avoiding the excluded letters).

Available letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common words:

- BROKE: B R O K E -> B and K are available. BROKE is a word.
- CHOKE: C H O K E -> but O is already in position 3, and we are using O again? In CHOKE, O is in position 3, which is correct, but we are assuming no duplicate O? But we don't know. However, in CHOKE, the pattern is C H O K E, which is _ R O _ E? No, because position 2 is H, not R. So it doesn't fit the pattern.

Our pattern requires position 2 to be R and position 3 to be O. So the word must have R in second and O in third.

So:

- BROKE: B R O K E -> yes, fits: B in 1, R in 2, O in 3, K in 4, E in 5.
- DROVE: D R O V E -> D in 1, R in 2, O in 3, V in 4, E in 5.
- GROVE: G R O V E -> G in 1, R in 2, O in 3, V in 4, E in 5.
- FROZE: F R O Z E -> F in 1, R in 2, O in 3, Z in 4, E in 5.
- TROVE: T is excluded, so no.
- PROBE: P is excluded.
- CROWD: C R O W D -> but then E is not at the end? No, it must end with E. CROWD ends with D.
- CROME: not a word.
- GROPE: G R O P E -> but P is excluded.
- WROTE: W R O T E -> T is excluded.
- BRIDE: B R I D E -> but position 3 is I, not O. Doesn't fit.

So the common words that fit the pattern and use available letters are: BROKE, DROVE, GROVE, FROZE.

Also, maybe: 
- PROVE: P is excluded.
- TRODE: T excluded.
- GROPE: P excluded.
- CHORE: C H O R E -> but position 2 is H, not R. Doesn't fit.

Another one: 
- IRONE? Not a word.
- KRONE: K R O N E -> but N is excluded (from guess2: N is not in the word). So no.
- PRONE: we already guessed, and N is not in the word.

So the candidates are: BROKE, DROVE, GROVE, FROZE.

We have four possibilities. We need to choose one to guess.

We are on the third guess. We can try one of these.

But note: we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? For example, could the word be ""BROOD""? But it doesn't end with E, and we know it ends with E. Or ""ROUSE"", but S is excluded and pattern doesn't match.

So we focus on the four.

To choose among BROKE, DROVE, GROVE, FROZE, we can pick one that uses more common letters or that might help eliminate others.

But since we are guessing the word, if we guess one and it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on the new letters.

For example, if we guess BROKE and it's wrong, we know that B and K are not in the word, then the word must be one of DROVE, GROVE, FROZE. Then we can guess accordingly.

Similarly for others.

But to maximize the chance of being right, we might choose the most common word. Or to get more information, but we are only testing two new letters.

Since we have to pick one, let's choose BROKE because it uses B and K, which are common.

But DROVE and GROVE are also common.

Another idea: we can choose a word that uses letters that appear in multiple candidates? But the candidates don't share the same letters for position1 and 4.

For example:
- BROKE: B, K
- DROVE: D, V
- GROVE: G, V
- FROZE: F, Z

Note that V appears in DROVE and GROVE. So if we guess a word that has V, we can check if V is in the word.

But we are constrained by the pattern. We cannot change the known positions.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that is not one of the candidates but tests more letters? But we know three positions, so we must have the pattern _ R O _ E. If we guess a word that doesn't fit, we might get less information? Actually, we must guess a valid word, and it must have R in position2, O in position3, E in position5. So we cannot change those.

Therefore, we have to guess a word of the form [new1] R O [new2] E.

So we must choose new1 and new2 from the available letters.

We can choose a word that uses letters that are in multiple candidates? But the candidates have distinct pairs.

We can choose a word that uses a letter that is in the candidate set, but we are going to guess one of them.

I think the best is to guess one of the candidates. Let's pick the most common one.

According to word frequency, DROVE and GROVE are more common than BROKE and FROZE? But BROKE is also common.

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters.

I'll go with DROVE because it's a very common word.

But let's see: if we guess DROVE and it's wrong, we know D and V are not in the word, then the word must be BROKE or FROZE (since GROVE also has V, so if V is not in the word, then GROVE is out). Then we can guess BROKE next, and if wrong, then FROZE.

Similarly, if we guess GROVE and it's wrong, then if V is not in the word, then DROVE is also out, so only BROKE and FROZE remain.

But if we guess BROKE and it's wrong, then we know B and K are not in, so then DROVE, GROVE, FROZE remain. Then we can guess a word that tests V? But we can't because we have to fill the pattern. We could guess GROVE, for example, to test V and G.

But we are limited by the pattern.

Alternatively, we can think of a word that uses a letter that is not in any candidate? But that might not be efficient.

For example, we could guess ""FRISE"" but that doesn't fit the pattern (must be _ R O _ E, so position3 must be O).

We must have O in position3.

So I think we have to guess one of the candidates.

I'll choose BROKE because it uses B and K, which are not in the other candidates (except FROZE has different letters).

So let's guess BROKE.

But note: in BROKE, the fourth letter is K. Is that acceptable? Yes.

So the guess is BROKE.

But let me confirm the feedback we might get.

If the word is DROVE, then for BROKE: 
- B: not in word -> x
- R: correct position -> ✓
- O: correct position -> ✓
- K: not in word (since DROVE has D, R, O, V, E) -> x
- E: correct -> ✓

So we get: B(x) R(✓) O(✓) K(x) E(✓)

Then we know the word is not BROKE, and B and K are not in the word. Then the word must be DROVE, GROVE, or FROZE. But we know the first letter must be one that we haven't tried, and the fourth letter must be V or Z. But we don't know which. Then we can guess DROVE next. If DROVE is correct, we win. If not, then we know D is not in, so it must be GROVE or FROZE. Then we have to guess again.

But we have only 6 tries, so we can do that.

Alternatively, if we guess DROVE and it's correct, we win. If not, we know D and V: if D is not in, then the word must be BROKE or FROZE (if V is not in, then GROVE is out). But if we guess DROVE and get feedback that D is not in and V is not in, then we know the word is BROKE or FROZE? But BROKE has K, and FROZE has Z. Then we can guess a word that distinguishes them? But we have to use the pattern.

For example, if we guess DROVE and it's wrong, and we get D(x) R(✓) O(✓) V(?) E(✓). If V is also x, then the word must be BROKE or FROZE. Then we can guess BROKE: if it's not, then it must be FROZE.

But we have two more guesses after the third.

But to save guesses, we might want to choose a word that covers more possibilities.

Another idea: we can guess a word that uses a letter that is in one candidate but not others? But we are constrained.

For example, if we guess a word with V, like GROVE, then if V is in the word, it must be DROVE or GROVE (and we see the position). If V is not, then it must be BROKE or FROZE.

Similarly, if we guess FROZE, we test Z.

But FROZE is less common.

I think the most efficient is to guess a word that has V, because V is in two candidates (DROVE and GROVE). So if V is in the word, we narrow to DROVE and GROVE. If not, to BROKE and FROZE.

So let's guess a word that has V in the fourth position? That would be either DROVE or GROVE. But we don't know the first letter.

We can guess GROVE, for example.

If we guess GROVE:
- If correct, we win.
- If not, and if V is in the word (but in the wrong position? but in GROVE, V is in position4, and if the word is DROVE, then V is in position4, so it should be correct? No, because if the word is DROVE, then position4 is V, so in GROVE, position4 is V, so it would be correct? But the first letter is different.

If the word is DROVE, and we guess GROVE:
- G: not in word -> x
- R: correct -> ✓
- O: correct -> ✓
- V: correct (because in DROVE, V is in position4) -> ✓
- E: correct -> ✓

So we get G(x) R(✓) O(✓) V(✓) E(✓). Then we know the word is ? R O V E, and the first letter is not G, and not any of the excluded. Then we know it must be DROVE (since D is the only common one left? But what about other words? We listed DROVE and GROVE, but if G is not, then DROVE. Are there others? Like TROVE? T is excluded. So only DROVE.

Similarly, if the word is BROKE, and we guess GROVE:
- G: not in BROKE -> x
- R: ✓
- O: ✓
- V: not in BROKE -> x
- E: ✓

So we get G(x) R(✓) O(✓) V(x) E(✓). Then we know the word is ? R O ? E, and G and V are not in, so it must be BROKE or FROZE. Then we can guess BROKE next.

Similarly, if the word is FROZE, we get the same: G(x) R(✓) O(✓) V(x) E(✓), and then we know it's BROKE or FROZE.

So by guessing GROVE, we can distinguish:

- If we get V(✓), then the word is DROVE (since G is not in, and V is in position4, so it must be DROVE).
- If we get V(x), then the word is either BROKE or FROZE.

Then we can guess BROKE next: if correct, win; if not, then FROZE.

This seems efficient.

We could also guess DROVE and get similar information.

But let's choose GROVE.

So I'll go with GROVE.

But note: we are on the third guess. We have three more guesses after this (guesses 4,5,6). So we have room.

Therefore, I will guess ""GROVE"".

But let me confirm: is GROVE a valid word? Yes.

So the guess is GROVE.

In the response, we output: <guess>GROVE</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: SLATE** → S(x), L(x), A(x), T(x), E(✓)  
  This means:  
  - E is in the secret word and correctly positioned at the 5th letter.  
  - S, L, A, T are not in the secret word.  

- **Guess 2: PRONE** → P(x), R(✓), O(✓), N(x), E(✓)  
  This means:  
  - R is in the secret word and correctly positioned at the 2nd letter.  
  - O is in the secret word and correctly positioned at the 3rd letter.  
  - E is confirmed again at the 5th letter.  
  - P and N are not in the secret word.  

### Deductions:
- The secret word has the fixed pattern: `_ R O _ E` (where the 2nd letter is R, 3rd is O, and 5th is E).  
- Excluded letters (not in the word): **S, L, A, T, P, N** (from both guesses).  
- Known letters in the word: **R, O, E** (with fixed positions).  
- Remaining unknown positions: **1st and 4th letters**.  
- Available letters (not excluded and not yet confirmed): **B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.  
- Since no duplicate letters have been indicated, we assume the secret word has distinct letters for now.  

### Strategy for the next guess:
- The guess must fit the pattern `_ R O _ E` to test the unknown 1st and 4th positions.  
- Use new, high-frequency letters from the available set to maximize information.  
- Common candidate words matching the pattern and available letters include:  
  - **BROKE** (tests B and K)  
  - **DROVE** (tests D and V)  
  - **GROVE** (tests G and V)  
  - **FROZE** (tests F and Z)  
- **GROVE** is chosen because:  
  - It tests **G** and **V**, which are common letters.  
  - **V** appears in multiple candidates (DROVE and GROVE), so feedback on V will help narrow down possibilities:  
    - If V is correct (✓), the word is likely **DROVE** (since G would be incorrect).  
    - If V is absent (x), the word is likely **BROKE** or **FROZE**.  
  - This provides efficient information for future guesses if GROVE is incorrect.  

<guess>GROVE</guess>",GROVE,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: SLATE -> S(x), L(x), A(x), T(x), E(✓)
This means:
- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th).
- S, L, A, T are not in the word.

Guess 2: PRONE -> P(x), R(✓), O(✓), N(x), E(✓)
This means:
- R and O are in the word and in the correct positions? Let's see the feedback: R(✓) and O(✓) mean they are correct and in the right positions. Also E(✓) is again correct in position 5.
- P and N are not in the word.

But note: the feedback for PRONE: 
  P (position 1): x -> not in word
  R (position 2): ✓ -> correct and in position 2
  O (position 3): ✓ -> correct and in position 3
  N (position 4): x -> not in word
  E (position 5): ✓ -> correct and in position 5

So, we know:
- The secret word has the following pattern: _ R O _ E
- The letters that are not in the word: S, L, A, T, P, N (from both guesses)

We also know that the word must be of the form: [letter1] R O [letter4] E

And we know that letter1 and letter4 cannot be S, L, A, T, P, N.

Moreover, we have used the letters: S, L, A, T, E, P, R, O, N (from the two guesses). But R, O, E are in the word, so we don't need to avoid them? Actually, we can reuse them if necessary, but since they are already known, it's better to test new letters.

But note: the word has only 5 letters, and we already know 3 of them: positions 2,3,5 are R, O, E. So we only need to find the first and fourth letters.

We must avoid the letters that are not in the word: S, L, A, T, P, N.

Available letters: all letters except S, L, A, T, P, N and the ones we know are in the word (R, O, E). But R, O, E are already placed, so for the missing positions, we can use any letter not excluded, but note that the word might have duplicate letters? However, we have no evidence of duplicates so far, so we assume no duplicates until contradicted.

Therefore, for position 1 and 4, we need to choose from the remaining alphabet, excluding: S, L, A, T, P, N, and also excluding R, O, E (because they are already in the word and we assume no duplicates?).

But wait: the feedback doesn't tell us if there are duplicates. For example, the word could have two R's? But in our first guess, we had only one R (in PRONE) and it was in position 2. We don't know if there is another R. Similarly for O and E. However, since we have no indication of duplicates, and to be efficient, we can assume no duplicates for now.

So, we assume the secret word has distinct letters. Therefore, for position 1 and 4, we must choose letters that are not in {S, L, A, T, P, N, R, O, E}.

Now, what are the common letters left? Let's list the alphabet:

A to Z, excluding: A, E, L, N, O, P, R, S, T.

So excluded: A, E, L, N, O, P, R, S, T.

Available: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a word of the form: [letter1] R O [letter4] E

We need to find a valid English word that fits: _ R O _ E, with the two blanks being two distinct letters from the available set.

Common words that fit this pattern? Let's think:

- PROSE? But P and S are excluded.
- ROUTE? R is already used, and we are assuming no duplicates? Also, R is in position 1? But our pattern is _ R O _ E, so the first letter is not R. ROUTE has R in position 1, which would be a duplicate? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, in ROUTE, the R is in position 1, but we have R in position 2, so that would be two R's? We don't have evidence against duplicates, but let's avoid for now.

We should consider words without duplicates from the excluded set.

Possible words:

- GROVE: G is available, V is available? Pattern: G R O V E -> but then the fourth letter is V. Is that a word? Yes, GROVE. But we have to check if G and V are available: yes, they are in the available set.

But wait, in GROVE, the fourth letter is V, so the word is G R O V E. That fits the pattern.

But we have to check if we have excluded any of these: G, R, O, V, E. R, O, E are already known to be in the word, but we are using them again? In the pattern, we know positions 2,3,5 are fixed as R, O, E. So in GROVE, we have:
  position1: G
  position2: R (matches)
  position3: O (matches)
  position4: V
  position5: E (matches)

So it fits. And G and V are not excluded.

But we haven't tested G and V yet, so we don't know if they are in the word. This guess would test G and V.

Another possibility: BROME? But B is available, M is available. BROME is a word? Actually, BROME is not a common word. Brome is a type of grass, but let's stick to common words.

GROVE is a common word.

Other options: 
- FROZE: F and Z are available. FROZE: F R O Z E -> fits. But Z is less common.
- CROME? Not a word.
- DROVE: D and V. D is available. DROVE is a common word.

So DROVE: D R O V E.

We have two options: GROVE and DROVE.

Which one to choose? We want to maximize information. But note, we are only missing two letters, and we are testing two new letters in either case.

But we have to consider that if we guess one of these, and it's not the word, we get feedback on the two new letters.

However, we have only 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We might get it right.

But let's see: we know the word is ?R O ? E, and we have two possibilities? Actually, there are more.

We should list possible words to see how many there are.

Possible words with pattern _ R O _ E, using letters from available set and no duplicates (and avoiding the excluded letters).

Available letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common words:

- BROKE: B R O K E -> B and K are available. BROKE is a word.
- CHOKE: C H O K E -> but O is already in position 3, and we are using O again? In CHOKE, O is in position 3, which is correct, but we are assuming no duplicate O? But we don't know. However, in CHOKE, the pattern is C H O K E, which is _ R O _ E? No, because position 2 is H, not R. So it doesn't fit the pattern.

Our pattern requires position 2 to be R and position 3 to be O. So the word must have R in second and O in third.

So:

- BROKE: B R O K E -> yes, fits: B in 1, R in 2, O in 3, K in 4, E in 5.
- DROVE: D R O V E -> D in 1, R in 2, O in 3, V in 4, E in 5.
- GROVE: G R O V E -> G in 1, R in 2, O in 3, V in 4, E in 5.
- FROZE: F R O Z E -> F in 1, R in 2, O in 3, Z in 4, E in 5.
- TROVE: T is excluded, so no.
- PROBE: P is excluded.
- CROWD: C R O W D -> but then E is not at the end? No, it must end with E. CROWD ends with D.
- CROME: not a word.
- GROPE: G R O P E -> but P is excluded.
- WROTE: W R O T E -> T is excluded.
- BRIDE: B R I D E -> but position 3 is I, not O. Doesn't fit.

So the common words that fit the pattern and use available letters are: BROKE, DROVE, GROVE, FROZE.

Also, maybe: 
- PROVE: P is excluded.
- TRODE: T excluded.
- GROPE: P excluded.
- CHORE: C H O R E -> but position 2 is H, not R. Doesn't fit.

Another one: 
- IRONE? Not a word.
- KRONE: K R O N E -> but N is excluded (from guess2: N is not in the word). So no.
- PRONE: we already guessed, and N is not in the word.

So the candidates are: BROKE, DROVE, GROVE, FROZE.

We have four possibilities. We need to choose one to guess.

We are on the third guess. We can try one of these.

But note: we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? For example, could the word be ""BROOD""? But it doesn't end with E, and we know it ends with E. Or ""ROUSE"", but S is excluded and pattern doesn't match.

So we focus on the four.

To choose among BROKE, DROVE, GROVE, FROZE, we can pick one that uses more common letters or that might help eliminate others.

But since we are guessing the word, if we guess one and it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on the new letters.

For example, if we guess BROKE and it's wrong, we know that B and K are not in the word, then the word must be one of DROVE, GROVE, FROZE. Then we can guess accordingly.

Similarly for others.

But to maximize the chance of being right, we might choose the most common word. Or to get more information, but we are only testing two new letters.

Since we have to pick one, let's choose BROKE because it uses B and K, which are common.

But DROVE and GROVE are also common.

Another idea: we can choose a word that uses letters that appear in multiple candidates? But the candidates don't share the same letters for position1 and 4.

For example:
- BROKE: B, K
- DROVE: D, V
- GROVE: G, V
- FROZE: F, Z

Note that V appears in DROVE and GROVE. So if we guess a word that has V, we can check if V is in the word.

But we are constrained by the pattern. We cannot change the known positions.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that is not one of the candidates but tests more letters? But we know three positions, so we must have the pattern _ R O _ E. If we guess a word that doesn't fit, we might get less information? Actually, we must guess a valid word, and it must have R in position2, O in position3, E in position5. So we cannot change those.

Therefore, we have to guess a word of the form [new1] R O [new2] E.

So we must choose new1 and new2 from the available letters.

We can choose a word that uses letters that are in multiple candidates? But the candidates have distinct pairs.

We can choose a word that uses a letter that is in the candidate set, but we are going to guess one of them.

I think the best is to guess one of the candidates. Let's pick the most common one.

According to word frequency, DROVE and GROVE are more common than BROKE and FROZE? But BROKE is also common.

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters.

I'll go with DROVE because it's a very common word.

But let's see: if we guess DROVE and it's wrong, we know D and V are not in the word, then the word must be BROKE or FROZE (since GROVE also has V, so if V is not in the word, then GROVE is out). Then we can guess BROKE next, and if wrong, then FROZE.

Similarly, if we guess GROVE and it's wrong, then if V is not in the word, then DROVE is also out, so only BROKE and FROZE remain.

But if we guess BROKE and it's wrong, then we know B and K are not in, so then DROVE, GROVE, FROZE remain. Then we can guess a word that tests V? But we can't because we have to fill the pattern. We could guess GROVE, for example, to test V and G.

But we are limited by the pattern.

Alternatively, we can think of a word that uses a letter that is not in any candidate? But that might not be efficient.

For example, we could guess ""FRISE"" but that doesn't fit the pattern (must be _ R O _ E, so position3 must be O).

We must have O in position3.

So I think we have to guess one of the candidates.

I'll choose BROKE because it uses B and K, which are not in the other candidates (except FROZE has different letters).

So let's guess BROKE.

But note: in BROKE, the fourth letter is K. Is that acceptable? Yes.

So the guess is BROKE.

But let me confirm the feedback we might get.

If the word is DROVE, then for BROKE: 
- B: not in word -> x
- R: correct position -> ✓
- O: correct position -> ✓
- K: not in word (since DROVE has D, R, O, V, E) -> x
- E: correct -> ✓

So we get: B(x) R(✓) O(✓) K(x) E(✓)

Then we know the word is not BROKE, and B and K are not in the word. Then the word must be DROVE, GROVE, or FROZE. But we know the first letter must be one that we haven't tried, and the fourth letter must be V or Z. But we don't know which. Then we can guess DROVE next. If DROVE is correct, we win. If not, then we know D is not in, so it must be GROVE or FROZE. Then we have to guess again.

But we have only 6 tries, so we can do that.

Alternatively, if we guess DROVE and it's correct, we win. If not, we know D and V: if D is not in, then the word must be BROKE or FROZE (if V is not in, then GROVE is out). But if we guess DROVE and get feedback that D is not in and V is not in, then we know the word is BROKE or FROZE? But BROKE has K, and FROZE has Z. Then we can guess a word that distinguishes them? But we have to use the pattern.

For example, if we guess DROVE and it's wrong, and we get D(x) R(✓) O(✓) V(?) E(✓). If V is also x, then the word must be BROKE or FROZE. Then we can guess BROKE: if it's not, then it must be FROZE.

But we have two more guesses after the third.

But to save guesses, we might want to choose a word that covers more possibilities.

Another idea: we can guess a word that uses a letter that is in one candidate but not others? But we are constrained.

For example, if we guess a word with V, like GROVE, then if V is in the word, it must be DROVE or GROVE (and we see the position). If V is not, then it must be BROKE or FROZE.

Similarly, if we guess FROZE, we test Z.

But FROZE is less common.

I think the most efficient is to guess a word that has V, because V is in two candidates (DROVE and GROVE). So if V is in the word, we narrow to DROVE and GROVE. If not, to BROKE and FROZE.

So let's guess a word that has V in the fourth position? That would be either DROVE or GROVE. But we don't know the first letter.

We can guess GROVE, for example.

If we guess GROVE:
- If correct, we win.
- If not, and if V is in the word (but in the wrong position? but in GROVE, V is in position4, and if the word is DROVE, then V is in position4, so it should be correct? No, because if the word is DROVE, then position4 is V, so in GROVE, position4 is V, so it would be correct? But the first letter is different.

If the word is DROVE, and we guess GROVE:
- G: not in word -> x
- R: correct -> ✓
- O: correct -> ✓
- V: correct (because in DROVE, V is in position4) -> ✓
- E: correct -> ✓

So we get G(x) R(✓) O(✓) V(✓) E(✓). Then we know the word is ? R O V E, and the first letter is not G, and not any of the excluded. Then we know it must be DROVE (since D is the only common one left? But what about other words? We listed DROVE and GROVE, but if G is not, then DROVE. Are there others? Like TROVE? T is excluded. So only DROVE.

Similarly, if the word is BROKE, and we guess GROVE:
- G: not in BROKE -> x
- R: ✓
- O: ✓
- V: not in BROKE -> x
- E: ✓

So we get G(x) R(✓) O(✓) V(x) E(✓). Then we know the word is ? R O ? E, and G and V are not in, so it must be BROKE or FROZE. Then we can guess BROKE next.

Similarly, if the word is FROZE, we get the same: G(x) R(✓) O(✓) V(x) E(✓), and then we know it's BROKE or FROZE.

So by guessing GROVE, we can distinguish:

- If we get V(✓), then the word is DROVE (since G is not in, and V is in position4, so it must be DROVE).
- If we get V(x), then the word is either BROKE or FROZE.

Then we can guess BROKE next: if correct, win; if not, then FROZE.

This seems efficient.

We could also guess DROVE and get similar information.

But let's choose GROVE.

So I'll go with GROVE.

But note: we are on the third guess. We have three more guesses after this (guesses 4,5,6). So we have room.

Therefore, I will guess ""GROVE"".

But let me confirm: is GROVE a valid word? Yes.

So the guess is GROVE.

In the response, we output: <guess>GROVE</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: SLATE** → S(x), L(x), A(x), T(x), E(✓)  
  This means:  
  - E is in the secret word and correctly positioned at the 5th letter.  
  - S, L, A, T are not in the secret word.  

- **Guess 2: PRONE** → P(x), R(✓), O(✓), N(x), E(✓)  
  This means:  
  - R is in the secret word and correctly positioned at the 2nd letter.  
  - O is in the secret word and correctly positioned at the 3rd letter.  
  - E is confirmed again at the 5th letter.  
  - P and N are not in the secret word.  

### Deductions:
- The secret word has the fixed pattern: `_ R O _ E` (where the 2nd letter is R, 3rd is O, and 5th is E).  
- Excluded letters (not in the word): **S, L, A, T, P, N** (from both guesses).  
- Known letters in the word: **R, O, E** (with fixed positions).  
- Remaining unknown positions: **1st and 4th letters**.  
- Available letters (not excluded and not yet confirmed): **B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.  
- Since no duplicate letters have been indicated, we assume the secret word has distinct letters for now.  

### Strategy for the next guess:
- The guess must fit the pattern `_ R O _ E` to test the unknown 1st and 4th positions.  
- Use new, high-frequency letters from the available set to maximize information.  
- Common candidate words matching the pattern and available letters include:  
  - **BROKE** (tests B and K)  
  - **DROVE** (tests D and V)  
  - **GROVE** (tests G and V)  
  - **FROZE** (tests F and Z)  
- **GROVE** is chosen because:  
  - It tests **G** and **V**, which are common letters.  
  - **V** appears in multiple candidates (DROVE and GROVE), so feedback on V will help narrow down possibilities:  
    - If V is correct (✓), the word is likely **DROVE** (since G would be incorrect).  
    - If V is absent (x), the word is likely **BROKE** or **FROZE**.  
  - This provides efficient information for future guesses if GROVE is incorrect.",Guess 3: GROVE -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(✓) O(✓) V(x) E(✓),FAIL

- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback. We need to make an initial guess.
 Since the goal is to maximize information, we should choose a word that has common letters and a balanced set of vowels and consonants.
 Popular starting words in Wordle often include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose the word ""SLATE"". It has 5 distinct letters, including common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (S, L, T).

 However, note that the game rules require a valid 5-letter English word.

 Therefore, I will start with ""SLATE"".

 But note: the problem says to return in the format: <guess>SLATE</guess>.I need to make my first guess in the Wordle game. Since there's no prior feedback, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain. The best initial guesses typically:
- Use common letters from the English language
- Include a mix of vowels and consonants
- Avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities

Good starter words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ROAST"" work well. I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it:
- Contains three common consonants (C, R, N)
- Includes two important vowels (A, E)
- Has all unique letters
- Covers frequent letter positions (like R often in position 2)

This will provide useful feedback markers for narrowing down the secret word.

<guess>SLATE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on our first guess ""SLATE"":
- S: x (not in the word)
- L: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- T: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position, which is the 5th position)

So, we know:
1. The secret word ends with E (since E is in position 5 and correct).
2. The letters S, L, A, T are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, we must avoid using S, L, A, T in our next guess.

Since E is fixed at the end, we need to guess the first four letters.

Our next guess should:
- Have E as the last letter (5th position).
- Not contain S, L, A, T.
- Be a valid English word.

We also want to gain as much information as possible about the other letters. So we should try to include common letters that we haven't tested yet.

Common consonants we haven't used: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Common vowels: We know E is in the word (at the end). Other vowels: I, O, U (since A is out).

But note: E is the only vowel we have confirmed, but there might be others.

Given the constraints, let's think of words ending with E.

Some common words ending with E: 
- ...E, such as ""TABLE"" but T and A are out, so not.
We need words without S,L,A,T.

Examples:
- ""BRINE"" (B,R,I,N,E) - but we have E at the end.
- ""PRICE"" (P,R,I,C,E) - same.
- ""CRIME"" (C,R,I,M,E) - same.

But note: in the first guess, we didn't test R, I, C, etc. Let's choose a word that uses new letters.

Possible words ending with E and without forbidden letters:
- BRINE: B,R,I,N,E
- PRONE: P,R,O,N,E
- CRONE: C,R,O,N,E
- DRONE: D,R,O,N,E
- GRIME: G,R,I,M,E
- PRICE? P,R,I,C,E

We also note that since E is confirmed at the end, we can focus on the first four letters.

We haven't tested R, I, N, etc. Let's pick a word that uses common letters and multiple new ones.

I think ""BRINE"" is a good candidate: 
- B, R, I, N are all new letters, so we can test them.
- It ends with E.

Alternatively, ""CRIME"": C,R,I,M,E.

But note: we must be cautious because we have only one E and we know it's at the end, so we shouldn't put E elsewhere? The feedback says E is at the end, but it doesn't say that there isn't another E. However, since we used only one E and it was at the end and correct, we don't know if the word has more E's. But typically, we assume no duplicates until feedback suggests otherwise.

However, in our next guess, we can only have E at the end to avoid confusion? Actually, we can put E elsewhere if we suspect a double E, but since none of the other vowels were in the word (from first guess: A was not present, and we didn't test others), and E was only at the end, it's safer to assume no double E for now.

So, let's avoid having another E.

Therefore, words ending with E: BRINE, CRIME, PRONE, etc.

Let me consider ""BRINE"": 
- Positions: B in 1, R in 2, I in 3, N in 4, E in 5.

If we use ""BRINE"", we test B, R, I, N, and confirm E at the end.

Another option: ""PRICE"" (P,R,I,C,E) — C is a common letter.

Or ""PRIME"" (P,R,I,M,E).

Since we have limited tries, we need to cover more common letters.

The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, ... but T and A are out. So, O, I, N are good.

So ""PRONE"" has O and N.

I think I'll go with ""PRONE"": P,R,O,N,E.

Why?
- P, R, O, N are all new letters.
- It ends with E.
- Common letters: R, O, N are very common.

This will give us information about four new letters.

Let me verify: is ""PRONE"" a valid word? Yes.

So, next guess: PRONE.

We'll return: <guess>PRONE</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""SLATE"": 
- S, L, A, T are **not** in the secret word (all marked ""x"").
- E is in the word and **correctly positioned at the end** (5th letter).

This means:
- The secret word ends with E.
- The secret word does NOT contain S, L, A, or T.
- The first four letters of the secret word are unknown, but must be from the remaining alphabet (excluding S, L, A, T).

For the second guess:
- It must end with E to confirm or add information about the 5th position.
- It should avoid S, L, A, T entirely.
- It should use new, high-frequency letters to maximize information gain (e.g., common consonants like R, N, P, or vowels like O, I).

A strong choice is **PRONE**:
- Ends with E, aligning with the known 5th-position E.
- Tests new common letters: P, R, O, N (all not used in the first guess).
- Valid 5-letter English word.

This guess efficiently explores frequent letters and builds on the known E position.

  E (position 5): ✓ -> correct and in position 5

So, we know:
- The secret word has the following pattern: _ R O _ E
- The letters that are not in the word: S, L, A, T, P, N (from both guesses)

We also know that the word must be of the form: [letter1] R O [letter4] E

And we know that letter1 and letter4 cannot be S, L, A, T, P, N.

Moreover, we have used the letters: S, L, A, T, E, P, R, O, N (from the two guesses). But R, O, E are in the word, so we don't need to avoid them? Actually, we can reuse them if necessary, but since they are already known, it's better to test new letters.

But note: the word has only 5 letters, and we already know 3 of them: positions 2,3,5 are R, O, E. So we only need to find the first and fourth letters.

We must avoid the letters that are not in the word: S, L, A, T, P, N.

Available letters: all letters except S, L, A, T, P, N and the ones we know are in the word (R, O, E). But R, O, E are already placed, so for the missing positions, we can use any letter not excluded, but note that the word might have duplicate letters? However, we have no evidence of duplicates so far, so we assume no duplicates until contradicted.

Therefore, for position 1 and 4, we need to choose from the remaining alphabet, excluding: S, L, A, T, P, N, and also excluding R, O, E (because they are already in the word and we assume no duplicates?).

But wait: the feedback doesn't tell us if there are duplicates. For example, the word could have two R's? But in our first guess, we had only one R (in PRONE) and it was in position 2. We don't know if there is another R. Similarly for O and E. However, since we have no indication of duplicates, and to be efficient, we can assume no duplicates for now.

So, we assume the secret word has distinct letters. Therefore, for position 1 and 4, we must choose letters that are not in {S, L, A, T, P, N, R, O, E}.

Now, what are the common letters left? Let's list the alphabet:

A to Z, excluding: A, E, L, N, O, P, R, S, T.

So excluded: A, E, L, N, O, P, R, S, T.

Available: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a word of the form: [letter1] R O [letter4] E

We need to find a valid English word that fits: _ R O _ E, with the two blanks being two distinct letters from the available set.

Common words that fit this pattern? Let's think:

- PROSE? But P and S are excluded.
- ROUTE? R is already used, and we are assuming no duplicates? Also, R is in position 1? But our pattern is _ R O _ E, so the first letter is not R. ROUTE has R in position 1, which would be a duplicate? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, in ROUTE, the R is in position 1, but we have R in position 2, so that would be two R's? We don't have evidence against duplicates, but let's avoid for now.

We should consider words without duplicates from the excluded set.

Possible words:

- GROVE: G is available, V is available? Pattern: G R O V E -> but then the fourth letter is V. Is that a word? Yes, GROVE. But we have to check if G and V are available: yes, they are in the available set.

But wait, in GROVE, the fourth letter is V, so the word is G R O V E. That fits the pattern.

But we have to check if we have excluded any of these: G, R, O, V, E. R, O, E are already known to be in the word, but we are using them again? In the pattern, we know positions 2,3,5 are fixed as R, O, E. So in GROVE, we have:
  position1: G
  position2: R (matches)
  position3: O (matches)
  position4: V
  position5: E (matches)

So it fits. And G and V are not excluded.

But we haven't tested G and V yet, so we don't know if they are in the word. This guess would test G and V.

Another possibility: BROME? But B is available, M is available. BROME is a word? Actually, BROME is not a common word. Brome is a type of grass, but let's stick to common words.

GROVE is a common word.

Other options: 
- FROZE: F and Z are available. FROZE: F R O Z E -> fits. But Z is less common.
- CROME? Not a word.
- DROVE: D and V. D is available. DROVE is a common word.

So DROVE: D R O V E.

We have two options: GROVE and DROVE.

Which one to choose? We want to maximize information. But note, we are only missing two letters, and we are testing two new letters in either case.

But we have to consider that if we guess one of these, and it's not the word, we get feedback on the two new letters.

However, we have only 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We might get it right.

But let's see: we know the word is ?R O ? E, and we have two possibilities? Actually, there are more.

We should list possible words to see how many there are.

Possible words with pattern _ R O _ E, using letters from available set and no duplicates (and avoiding the excluded letters).

Available letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common words:

- BROKE: B R O K E -> B and K are available. BROKE is a word.
- CHOKE: C H O K E -> but O is already in position 3, and we are using O again? In CHOKE, O is in position 3, which is correct, but we are assuming no duplicate O? But we don't know. However, in CHOKE, the pattern is C H O K E, which is _ R O _ E? No, because position 2 is H, not R. So it doesn't fit the pattern.

Our pattern requires position 2 to be R and position 3 to be O. So the word must have R in second and O in third.

So:

- BROKE: B R O K E -> yes, fits: B in 1, R in 2, O in 3, K in 4, E in 5.
- DROVE: D R O V E -> D in 1, R in 2, O in 3, V in 4, E in 5.
- GROVE: G R O V E -> G in 1, R in 2, O in 3, V in 4, E in 5.
- FROZE: F R O Z E -> F in 1, R in 2, O in 3, Z in 4, E in 5.
- TROVE: T is excluded, so no.
- PROBE: P is excluded.
- CROWD: C R O W D -> but then E is not at the end? No, it must end with E. CROWD ends with D.
- CROME: not a word.
- GROPE: G R O P E -> but P is excluded.
- WROTE: W R O T E -> T is excluded.
- BRIDE: B R I D E -> but position 3 is I, not O. Doesn't fit.

So the common words that fit the pattern and use available letters are: BROKE, DROVE, GROVE, FROZE.

Also, maybe: 
- PROVE: P is excluded.
- TRODE: T excluded.
- GROPE: P excluded.
- CHORE: C H O R E -> but position 2 is H, not R. Doesn't fit.

Another one: 
- IRONE? Not a word.
- KRONE: K R O N E -> but N is excluded (from guess2: N is not in the word). So no.
- PRONE: we already guessed, and N is not in the word.

So the candidates are: BROKE, DROVE, GROVE, FROZE.

We have four possibilities. We need to choose one to guess.

We are on the third guess. We can try one of these.

But note: we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? For example, could the word be ""BROOD""? But it doesn't end with E, and we know it ends with E. Or ""ROUSE"", but S is excluded and pattern doesn't match.

So we focus on the four.

To choose among BROKE, DROVE, GROVE, FROZE, we can pick one that uses more common letters or that might help eliminate others.

But since we are guessing the word, if we guess one and it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on the new letters.

For example, if we guess BROKE and it's wrong, we know that B and K are not in the word, then the word must be one of DROVE, GROVE, FROZE. Then we can guess accordingly.

Similarly for others.

But to maximize the chance of being right, we might choose the most common word. Or to get more information, but we are only testing two new letters.

Since we have to pick one, let's choose BROKE because it uses B and K, which are common.

But DROVE and GROVE are also common.

Another idea: we can choose a word that uses letters that appear in multiple candidates? But the candidates don't share the same letters for position1 and 4.

For example:
- BROKE: B, K
- DROVE: D, V
- GROVE: G, V
- FROZE: F, Z

Note that V appears in DROVE and GROVE. So if we guess a word that has V, we can check if V is in the word.

But we are constrained by the pattern. We cannot change the known positions.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that is not one of the candidates but tests more letters? But we know three positions, so we must have the pattern _ R O _ E. If we guess a word that doesn't fit, we might get less information? Actually, we must guess a valid word, and it must have R in position2, O in position3, E in position5. So we cannot change those.

Therefore, we have to guess a word of the form [new1] R O [new2] E.

So we must choose new1 and new2 from the available letters.

We can choose a word that uses letters that are in multiple candidates? But the candidates have distinct pairs.

We can choose a word that uses a letter that is in the candidate set, but we are going to guess one of them.

I think the best is to guess one of the candidates. Let's pick the most common one.

According to word frequency, DROVE and GROVE are more common than BROKE and FROZE? But BROKE is also common.

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters.

I'll go with DROVE because it's a very common word.

But let's see: if we guess DROVE and it's wrong, we know D and V are not in the word, then the word must be BROKE or FROZE (since GROVE also has V, so if V is not in the word, then GROVE is out). Then we can guess BROKE next, and if wrong, then FROZE.

Similarly, if we guess GROVE and it's wrong, then if V is not in the word, then DROVE is also out, so only BROKE and FROZE remain.

But if we guess BROKE and it's wrong, then we know B and K are not in, so then DROVE, GROVE, FROZE remain. Then we can guess a word that tests V? But we can't because we have to fill the pattern. We could guess GROVE, for example, to test V and G.

But we are limited by the pattern.

Alternatively, we can think of a word that uses a letter that is not in any candidate? But that might not be efficient.

For example, we could guess ""FRISE"" but that doesn't fit the pattern (must be _ R O _ E, so position3 must be O).

We must have O in position3.

So I think we have to guess one of the candidates.

I'll choose BROKE because it uses B and K, which are not in the other candidates (except FROZE has different letters).

So let's guess BROKE.

But note: in BROKE, the fourth letter is K. Is that acceptable? Yes.

So the guess is BROKE.

But let me confirm the feedback we might get.

If the word is DROVE, then for BROKE: 
- B: not in word -> x
- R: correct position -> ✓
- O: correct position -> ✓
- K: not in word (since DROVE has D, R, O, V, E) -> x
- E: correct -> ✓

So we get: B(x) R(✓) O(✓) K(x) E(✓)

Then we know the word is not BROKE, and B and K are not in the word. Then the word must be DROVE, GROVE, or FROZE. But we know the first letter must be one that we haven't tried, and the fourth letter must be V or Z. But we don't know which. Then we can guess DROVE next. If DROVE is correct, we win. If not, then we know D is not in, so it must be GROVE or FROZE. Then we have to guess again.

But we have only 6 tries, so we can do that.

Alternatively, if we guess DROVE and it's correct, we win. If not, we know D and V: if D is not in, then the word must be BROKE or FROZE (if V is not in, then GROVE is out). But if we guess DROVE and get feedback that D is not in and V is not in, then we know the word is BROKE or FROZE? But BROKE has K, and FROZE has Z. Then we can guess a word that distinguishes them? But we have to use the pattern.

For example, if we guess DROVE and it's wrong, and we get D(x) R(✓) O(✓) V(?) E(✓). If V is also x, then the word must be BROKE or FROZE. Then we can guess BROKE: if it's not, then it must be FROZE.

But we have two more guesses after the third.

But to save guesses, we might want to choose a word that covers more possibilities.

Another idea: we can guess a word that uses a letter that is in one candidate but not others? But we are constrained.

For example, if we guess a word with V, like GROVE, then if V is in the word, it must be DROVE or GROVE (and we see the position). If V is not, then it must be BROKE or FROZE.

Similarly, if we guess FROZE, we test Z.

But FROZE is less common.

I think the most efficient is to guess a word that has V, because V is in two candidates (DROVE and GROVE). So if V is in the word, we narrow to DROVE and GROVE. If not, to BROKE and FROZE.

So let's guess a word that has V in the fourth position? That would be either DROVE or GROVE. But we don't know the first letter.

We can guess GROVE, for example.

If we guess GROVE:
- If correct, we win.
- If not, and if V is in the word (but in the wrong position? but in GROVE, V is in position4, and if the word is DROVE, then V is in position4, so it should be correct? No, because if the word is DROVE, then position4 is V, so in GROVE, position4 is V, so it would be correct? But the first letter is different.

If the word is DROVE, and we guess GROVE:
- G: not in word -> x
- R: correct -> ✓
- O: correct -> ✓
- V: correct (because in DROVE, V is in position4) -> ✓
- E: correct -> ✓

So we get G(x) R(✓) O(✓) V(✓) E(✓). Then we know the word is ? R O V E, and the first letter is not G, and not any of the excluded. Then we know it must be DROVE (since D is the only common one left? But what about other words? We listed DROVE and GROVE, but if G is not, then DROVE. Are there others? Like TROVE? T is excluded. So only DROVE.

Similarly, if the word is BROKE, and we guess GROVE:
- G: not in BROKE -> x
- R: ✓
- O: ✓
- V: not in BROKE -> x
- E: ✓

So we get G(x) R(✓) O(✓) V(x) E(✓). Then we know the word is ? R O ? E, and G and V are not in, so it must be BROKE or FROZE. Then we can guess BROKE next.

Similarly, if the word is FROZE, we get the same: G(x) R(✓) O(✓) V(x) E(✓), and then we know it's BROKE or FROZE.

So by guessing GROVE, we can distinguish:

- If we get V(✓), then the word is DROVE (since G is not in, and V is in position4, so it must be DROVE).
- If we get V(x), then the word is either BROKE or FROZE.

Then we can guess BROKE next: if correct, win; if not, then FROZE.

This seems efficient.

We could also guess DROVE and get similar information.

But let's choose GROVE.

So I'll go with GROVE.

But note: we are on the third guess. We have three more guesses after this (guesses 4,5,6). So we have room.

Therefore, I will guess ""GROVE"".

But let me confirm: is GROVE a valid word? Yes.

So the guess is GROVE.

In the response, we output: <guess>GROVE</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: SLATE** → S(x), L(x), A(x), T(x), E(✓)  
  This means:  
  - E is in the secret word and correctly positioned at the 5th letter.  
  - S, L, A, T are not in the secret word.  

- **Guess 2: PRONE** → P(x), R(✓), O(✓), N(x), E(✓)  
  This means:  
  - R is in the secret word and correctly positioned at the 2nd letter.  
  - O is in the secret word and correctly positioned at the 3rd letter.  
  - E is confirmed again at the 5th letter.  
  - P and N are not in the secret word.  

### Deductions:
- The secret word has the fixed pattern: `_ R O _ E` (where the 2nd letter is R, 3rd is O, and 5th is E).  
- Excluded letters (not in the word): **S, L, A, T, P, N** (from both guesses).  
- Known letters in the word: **R, O, E** (with fixed positions).  
- Remaining unknown positions: **1st and 4th letters**.  
- Available letters (not excluded and not yet confirmed): **B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.  
- Since no duplicate letters have been indicated, we assume the secret word has distinct letters for now.  

### Strategy for the next guess:
- The guess must fit the pattern `_ R O _ E` to test the unknown 1st and 4th positions.  
- Use new, high-frequency letters from the available set to maximize information.  
- Common candidate words matching the pattern and available letters include:  
  - **BROKE** (tests B and K)  
  - **DROVE** (tests D and V)  
  - **GROVE** (tests G and V)  
  - **FROZE** (tests F and Z)  
- **GROVE** is chosen because:  
  - It tests **G** and **V**, which are common letters.  
  - **V** appears in multiple candidates (DROVE and GROVE), so feedback on V will help narrow down possibilities:  
    - If V is correct (✓), the word is likely **DROVE** (since G would be incorrect).  
    - If V is absent (x), the word is likely **BROKE** or **FROZE**.  
  - This provides efficient information for future guesses if GROVE is incorrect.

The feedback says E is at the end, but it doesn\'t say that there isn\'t another E. However, since we used only one E and it was at the end and correct, we don\'t know if the word has more E\'s.

Also E(✓) is again correct in position 5.\n- P and N are not in the word.\n\nBut note: the feedback for PRONE: \n  P (position 1): x -> not in word\n  R (position 2): ✓ -> correct and in position 2\n  O (position 3): ✓ -> correct and in position 3\n  N (position 4): x -> not in word\n  E (position 5): ✓ -> correct and in position 5\n\nSo, we know:\n- The secret word has the following pattern: _ R O _ E\n- The letters that are not in the word: S, L, A, T, P, N (from both guesses)\n\nWe also know that the word must be of the form: [letter1] R O [letter4] E\n\nAnd we know that letter1 and letter4 cannot be S, L, A, T, P, N.\n\nMoreover, we have used the letters: S, L, A, T, E, P, R, O, N (from the two guesses). But R, O, E are in the word, so we don\'t need to avoid them? Actually, we can reuse them if necessary, but since they are already known, it\'s better to test new letters.\n\nBut note: the word has only 5 letters, and we already know 3 of them: positions 2,3,5 are R, O, E. So we only need to find the first and fourth letters.\n\nWe must avoid the letters that are not in the word: S, L, A, T, P, N.\n\nAvailable letters: all letters except S, L, A, T, P, N and the ones we know are in the word (R, O, E). But R, O, E are already placed, so for the missing positions, we can use any letter not excluded, but note that the word might have duplicate letters? However, we have no evidence of duplicates so far, so we assume no duplicates until contradicted.\n\nTherefore, for position 1 and 4, we need to choose from the remaining alphabet, excluding: S, L, A, T, P, N, and also excluding R, O, E (because they are already in the word and we assume no duplicates?).\n\nBut wait: the feedback doesn\'t tell us if there are duplicates. For example, the word could have two R\'s? But in our first guess, we had only one R (in PRONE) and it was in position 2. We don\'t know if there is another R. Similarly for O and E. However, since we have no indication of duplicates, and to be efficient, we can assume no duplicates for now.\n\nSo, we assume the secret word has distinct letters. Therefore, for position 1 and 4, we must choose letters that are not in {S, L, A, T, P, N, R, O, E}.\n\nNow, what are the common letters left? Let\'s list the alphabet:\n\nA to Z, excluding: A, E, L, N, O, P, R, S, T.\n\nSo excluded: A, E, L, N, O, P, R, S, T.\n\nAvailable: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe need to form a word of the form: [letter1] R O [letter4] E\n\nWe need to find a valid English word that fits: _ R O _ E, with the two blanks being two distinct letters from the available set.\n\nCommon words that fit this pattern? Let\'s think:\n\n- PROSE? But P and S are excluded.\n- ROUTE? R is already used, and we are assuming no duplicates? Also, R is in position 1? But our pattern is _ R O _ E, so the first letter is not R. ROUTE has R in position 1, which would be a duplicate? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. However, in ROUTE, the R is in position 1, but we have R in position 2, so that would be two R\'s? We don\'t have evidence against duplicates, but let\'s avoid for now.\n\nWe should consider words without duplicates from the excluded set.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- GROVE: G is available, V is available? Pattern: G R O V E -> but then the fourth letter is V. Is that a word? Yes, GROVE. But we have to check if G and V are available: yes, they are in the available set.\n\nBut wait, in GROVE, the fourth letter is V, so the word is G R O V E. That fits the pattern.\n\nBut we have to check if we have excluded any of these: G, R, O, V, E. R, O, E are already known to be in the word, but we are using them again? In the pattern, we know positions 2,3,5 are fixed as R, O, E. So in GROVE, we have:\n  position1: G\n  position2: R (matches)\n  position3: O (matches)\n  position4: V\n  position5: E (matches)\n\nSo it fits. And G and V are not excluded.\n\nBut we haven\'t tested G and V yet, so we don\'t know if they are in the word. This guess would test G and V.\n\nAnother possibility: BROME? But B is available, M is available. BROME is a word? Actually, BROME is not a common word. Brome is a type of grass, but let\'s stick to common words.\n\nGROVE is a common word.\n\nOther options: \n- FROZE: F and Z are available. FROZE: F R O Z E -> fits. But Z is less common.\n- CROME? Not a word.\n- DROVE: D and V. D is available. DROVE is a common word.\n\nSo DROVE: D R O V E.\n\nWe have two options: GROVE and DROVE.\n\nWhich one to choose? We want to maximize information. But note, we are only missing two letters, and we are testing two new letters in either case.\n\nBut we have to consider that if we guess one of these, and it\'s not the word, we get feedback on the two new letters.\n\nHowever, we have only 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We might get it right.\n\nBut let\'s see: we know the word is ?R O ? E, and we have two possibilities? Actually, there are more.\n\nWe should list possible words to see how many there are.\n\nPossible words with pattern _ R O _ E, using letters from available set and no duplicates (and avoiding the excluded letters).\n\nAvailable letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nCommon words:\n\n- BROKE: B R O K E -> B and K are available. BROKE is a word.\n- CHOKE: C H O K E -> but O is already in position 3, and we are using O again? In CHOKE, O is in position 3, which is correct, but we are assuming no duplicate O? But we don\'t know. However, in CHOKE, the pattern is C H O K E, which is _ R O _ E? No, because position 2 is H, not R. So it doesn\'t fit the pattern.\n\nOur pattern requires position 2 to be R and position 3 to be O. So the word must have R in second and O in third.\n\nSo:\n\n- BROKE: B R O K E -> yes, fits: B in 1, R in 2, O in 3, K in 4, E in 5.\n- DROVE: D R O V E -> D in 1, R in 2, O in 3, V in 4, E in 5.\n- GROVE: G R O V E -> G in 1, R in 2, O in 3, V in 4, E in 5.\n- FROZE: F R O Z E -> F in 1, R in 2, O in 3, Z in 4, E in 5.\n- TROVE: T is excluded, so no.\n- PROBE: P is excluded.\n- CROWD: C R O W D -> but then E is not at the end? No, it must end with E. CROWD ends with D.\n- CROME: not a word.\n- GROPE: G R O P E -> but P is excluded.\n- WROTE: W R O T E -> T is excluded.\n- BRIDE: B R I D E -> but position 3 is I, not O. Doesn\'t fit.\n\nSo the common words that fit the pattern and use available letters are: BROKE, DROVE, GROVE, FROZE.\n\nAlso, maybe: \n- PROVE: P is excluded.\n- TRODE: T excluded.\n- GROPE: P excluded.\n- CHORE: C H O R E -> but position 2 is H, not R. Doesn\'t fit.\n\nAnother one: \n- IRONE? Not a word.\n- KRONE: K R O N E -> but N is excluded (from guess2: N is not in the word). So no.\n- PRONE: we already guessed, and N is not in the word.\n\nSo the candidates are: BROKE, DROVE, GROVE, FROZE.\n\nWe have four possibilities. We need to choose one to guess.\n\nWe are on the third guess. We can try one of these.\n\nBut note: we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? For example, could the word be ""BROOD""? But it doesn\'t end with E, and we know it ends with E. Or ""ROUSE"", but S is excluded and pattern doesn\'t match.\n\nSo we focus on the four.\n\nTo choose among BROKE, DROVE, GROVE, FROZE, we can pick one that uses more common letters or that might help eliminate others.\n\nBut since we are guessing the word, if we guess one and it\'s correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on the new letters.\n\nFor example, if we guess BROKE and it\'s wrong, we know that B and K are not in the word, then the word must be one of DROVE, GROVE, FROZE. Then we can guess accordingly.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut to maximize the chance of being right, we might choose the most common word. Or to get more information, but we are only testing two new letters.\n\nSince we have to pick one, let\'s choose BROKE because it uses B and K, which are common.\n\nBut DROVE and GROVE are also common.\n\nAnother idea: we can choose a word that uses letters that appear in multiple candidates? But the candidates don\'t share the same letters for position1 and 4.\n\nFor example:\n- BROKE: B, K\n- DROVE: D, V\n- GROVE: G, V\n- FROZE: F, Z\n\nNote that V appears in DROVE and GROVE. So if we guess a word that has V, we can check if V is in the word.\n\nBut we are constrained by the pattern. We cannot change the known positions.\n\nAlternatively, we could guess a word that is not one of the candidates but tests more letters? But we know three positions, so we must have the pattern _ R O _ E. If we guess a word that doesn\'t fit, we might get less information? Actually, we must guess a valid word, and it must have R in position2, O in position3, E in position5. So we cannot change those.\n\nTherefore, we have to guess a word of the form [new1] R O [new2] E.\n\nSo we must choose new1 and new2 from the available letters.\n\nWe can choose a word that uses letters that are in multiple candidates? But the candidates have distinct pairs.\n\nWe can choose a word that uses a letter that is in the candidate set, but we are going to guess one of them.\n\nI think the best is to guess one of the candidates. Let\'s pick the most common one.\n\nAccording to word frequency, DROVE and GROVE are more common than BROKE and FROZE? But BROKE is also common.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the excluded letters.\n\nI\'ll go with DROVE because it\'s a very common word.\n\nBut let\'s see: if we guess DROVE and it\'s wrong, we know D and V are not in the word, then the word must be BROKE or FROZE (since GROVE also has V, so if V is not in the word, then GROVE is out). Then we can guess BROKE next, and if wrong, then FROZE.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess GROVE and it\'s wrong, then if V is not in the word, then DROVE is also out, so only BROKE and FROZE remain.\n\nBut if we guess BROKE and it\'s wrong, then we know B and K are not in, so then DROVE, GROVE, FROZE remain. Then we can guess a word that tests V? But we can\'t because we have to fill the pattern. We could guess GROVE, for example, to test V and G.\n\nBut we are limited by the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of a word that uses a letter that is not in any candidate? But that might not be efficient.\n\nFor example, we could guess ""FRISE"" but that doesn\'t fit the pattern (must be _ R O _ E, so position3 must be O).\n\nWe must have O in position3.\n\nSo I think we have to guess one of the candidates.\n\nI\'ll choose BROKE because it uses B and K, which are not in the other candidates (except FROZE has different letters).\n\nSo let\'s guess BROKE.\n\nBut note: in BROKE, the fourth letter is K. Is that acceptable? Yes.\n\nSo the guess is BROKE.\n\nBut let me confirm the feedback we might get.\n\nIf the word is DROVE, then for BROKE: \n- B: not in word -> x\n- R: correct position -> ✓\n- O: correct position -> ✓\n- K: not in word (since DROVE has D, R, O, V, E) -> x\n- E: correct -> ✓\n\nSo we get: B(x) R(✓) O(✓) K(x) E(✓)\n\nThen we know the word is not BROKE, and B and K are not in the word. Then the word must be DROVE, GROVE, or FROZE. But we know the first letter must be one that we haven\'t tried, and the fourth letter must be V or Z. But we don\'t know which. Then we can guess DROVE next. If DROVE is correct, we win. If not, then we know D is not in, so it must be GROVE or FROZE. Then we have to guess again.\n\nBut we have only 6 tries, so we can do that.\n\nAlternatively, if we guess DROVE and it\'s correct, we win. If not, we know D and V: if D is not in, then the word must be BROKE or FROZE (if V is not in, then GROVE is out). But if we guess DROVE and get feedback that D is not in and V is not in, then we know the word is BROKE or FROZE? But BROKE has K, and FROZE has Z. Then we can guess a word that distinguishes them? But we have to use the pattern.\n\nFor example, if we guess DROVE and it\'s wrong, and we get D(x) R(✓) O(✓) V(?) E(✓). If V is also x, then the word must be BROKE or FROZE. Then we can guess BROKE: if it\'s not, then it must be FROZE.\n\nBut we have two more guesses after the third.\n\nBut to save guesses, we might want to choose a word that covers more possibilities.\n\nAnother idea: we can guess a word that uses a letter that is in one candidate but not others? But we are constrained.\n\nFor example, if we guess a word with V, like GROVE, then if V is in the word, it must be DROVE or GROVE (and we see the position). If V is not, then it must be BROKE or FROZE.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess FROZE, we test Z.\n\nBut FROZE is less common.\n\nI think the most efficient is to guess a word that has V, because V is in two candidates (DROVE and GROVE). So if V is in the word, we narrow to DROVE and GROVE. If not, to BROKE and FROZE.\n\nSo let\'s guess a word that has V in the fourth position? That would be either DROVE or GROVE. But we don\'t know the first letter.\n\nWe can guess GROVE, for example.\n\nIf we guess GROVE:\n- If correct, we win.\n- If not, and if V is in the word (but in the wrong position? but in GROVE, V is in position4, and if the word is DROVE, then V is in position4, so it should be correct? No, because if the word is DROVE, then position4 is V, so in GROVE, position4 is V, so it would be correct? But the first letter is different.\n\nIf the word is DROVE, and we guess GROVE:\n- G: not in word -> x\n- R: correct -> ✓\n- O: correct -> ✓\n- V: correct (because in DROVE, V is in position4) -> ✓\n- E: correct -> ✓\n\nSo we get G(x) R(✓) O(✓) V(✓) E(✓). Then we know the word is ? R O V E, and the first letter is not G, and not any of the excluded. Then we know it must be DROVE (since D is the only common one left? But what about other words? We listed DROVE and GROVE, but if G is not, then DROVE. Are there others? Like TROVE? T is excluded. So only DROVE.\n\nSimilarly, if the word is BROKE, and we guess GROVE:\n- G: not in BROKE -> x\n- R: ✓\n- O: ✓\n- V: not in BROKE -> x\n- E: ✓\n\nSo we get G(x) R(✓) O(✓) V(x) E(✓). Then we know the word is ? R O ? E, and G and V are not in, so it must be BROKE or FROZE. Then we can guess BROKE next.\n\nSimilarly, if the word is FROZE, we get the same: G(x) R(✓) O(✓) V(x) E(✓), and then we know it\'s BROKE or FROZE.\n\nSo by guessing GROVE, we can distinguish:\n\n- If we get V(✓), then the word is DROVE (since G is not in, and V is in position4, so it must be DROVE).\n- If we get V(x), then the word is either BROKE or FROZE.\n\nThen we can guess BROKE next: if correct, win; if not, then FROZE.\n\nThis seems efficient.\n\nWe could also guess DROVE and get similar information.\n\nBut let\'s choose GROVE.\n\nSo I\'ll go with GROVE.\n\nBut note: we are on the third guess. We have three more guesses after this (guesses 4,5,6). So we have room.\n\nTherefore, I will guess ""GROVE"".\n\nBut let me confirm: is GROVE a valid word? Yes.\n\nSo the guess is GROVE.\n\nIn the response, we output: <guess>GROVE</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: SLATE** → S(x), L(x), A(x), T(x), E(✓)  \n  This means:  \n  - E is in the secret word and correctly positioned at the 5th letter.  \n  - S, L, A, T are not in the secret word.  \n\n- **Guess 2: PRONE** → P(x), R(✓), O(✓), N(x), E(✓)  \n  This means:  \n  - R is in the secret word and correctly positioned at the 2nd letter.  \n  - O is in the secret word and correctly positioned at the 3rd letter.  \n  - E is confirmed again at the 5th letter.  \n  - P and N are not in the secret word.  \n\n### Deductions:\n- The secret word has the fixed pattern: `_ R O _ E` (where the 2nd letter is R, 3rd is O, and 5th is E).  \n- Excluded letters (not in the word): **S, L, A, T, P, N** (from both guesses).  \n- Known letters in the word: **R, O, E** (with fixed positions).  \n- Remaining unknown positions: **1st and 4th letters**.  \n- Available letters (not excluded and not yet confirmed): **B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.  \n- Since no duplicate letters have been indicated, we assume the secret word has distinct letters for now.  \n\n### Strategy for the next guess:\n- The guess must fit the pattern `_ R O _ E` to test the unknown 1st and 4th positions.  \n- Use new, high-frequency letters from the available set to maximize information.  \n- Common candidate words matching the pattern and available letters include:  \n  - **BROKE** (tests B and K)  \n  - **DROVE** (tests D and V)  \n  - **GROVE** (tests G and V)  \n  - **FROZE** (tests F and Z)  \n- **GROVE** is chosen because:  \n  - It tests **G** and **V**, which are common letters.  \n  - **V** appears in multiple candidates (DROVE and GROVE), so feedback on V will help narrow down possibilities:  \n    - If V is correct (✓), the word is likely **DROVE** (since G would be incorrect).  \n    - If V is absent (x), the word is likely **BROKE** or **FROZE**.  \n  - This provides efficient information for future guesses if GROVE is incorrect.\n\n<guess>GROVE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: PRONE -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(✓) O(✓) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: GROVE -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(✓) O(✓) V(x) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: SLATE -> S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: PRONE -> P(x) R(✓) O(✓) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: GROVE -> G(x) R(✓) O(✓) V(x) E(✓)

From this, we know:
- E is in position 5 and correct (from all guesses).
- R is in position 2 and correct (since in both guess2 and guess3).
- O is in position 3 and correct (same as above).
- The following letters are NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, P, N, G, V (all marked with 'x' in feedback).

Additionally, the pattern of the word is: [unknown1] R O [unknown2] E

The exclusions mean the unknown1 and unknown2 positions must be filled with letters not in {S, L, A, T, P, N, G, V} and also not R, O, E (assuming no duplicates, as we have no evidence of duplicates). So excluded letters: A, E, G, L, N, O, P, R, S, T, V.

Available letters: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, we need to find a word of the form ? R O ? E using the available letters.

Possible words include:
- BROKE: B and K are available.
- FROZE: F and Z are available.
- Other possibilities: We had BROKE and FROZE before, but also consider if there are others.

Since GROVE was guessed and V is not in the word, DROVE is out (because it has V). Similarly, GROVE itself is out because G is not in the word.

So the remaining candidates from before are BROKE and FROZE.

But are there others?
- CROME? Not a valid word.
- PROLE? P is excluded.
- WRITE? T is excluded and doesn't end with E.
- BRINE? But N is excluded.

How about:
- CROKE? Not a word.
- FROME? Not a word.
- WROKE? Not common, and W is available.

Another possible word: ""BROME"" – but we tried BROME? Earlier we thought not common, and also N? Wait, BROME: B R O M E? M is available. And BROME is a valid word (a type of grass). But N is excluded? BROME has M, not N. Spell: B-R-O-M-E.

Position: B R O M E -> so first letter B, fourth letter M. Pattern ? R O ? E matches. And M is not excluded.

Also, ""CRORE""? But C R O R E – duplicates R? And pattern would be C R O R E, which has R in position 4 too? Not matching the pattern ? R O ? E (it has O in position 3, R in 4, but we need a letter in position 4 that is not R). And letter2 is R, but letter4 is R again.

We have B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z for position1 and position4.

So BROKE: B and K.
FROZE: F and Z.
BROME: B and M.

Also, DROME? D and M. DROME is an abbreviation or less common? Not familiar.

Or CHORE? But O is position 3, and pattern requires position 3 to be O, but CHORE: C H O R E -> position2 is H, not R. So no.

WRITE: doesn't have O in position3 and T excluded.

So common candidates: BROKE, FROZE, BROME.

We could have ""TRODE"" but T is excluded.

""IRONE""? Not standard.

So we have three candidates: BROKE (B,R,O,K,E), FROZE (F,R,O,Z,E), BROME (B,R,O,M,E).

Now, note that in our previous guess GROVE, we got V(x), so V is not in the word, which confirms DROVE and GROVE are invalid.

Now, we need to guess one of these or a new word.

But we are constrained to the pattern ? R O ? E.

To choose among BROKE, FROZE, BROME, we might pick one that covers common letters.

B appears in two of these (BROKE and BROME), so if we guess a word with B, we get information about B.

Similarly, we could guess BROME to test B and M.

If we guess BROKE:
- If correct, we win.
- If not, we know B and K are not in the word? But wait: if BROKE is not correct, then because we know R,O,E are fixed, only position1 and 4 are wrong. So if we get feedback that B and K are not present (x), then the word must be FROZE (since BROME would have B, so if B is x, then BROME is also invalid). Then FROZE would be left.

Similarly, if we guess BROME and it's wrong:
- If B and M are not present? Then FROZE must be the word.

If we guess FROZE and it's wrong, then BROKE or BROME is correct.

So to minimize worst-case, we can choose any.

But let's guess BROKE, as it is a very common word.

After that, if wrong, we can guess FROZE, and if wrong again, BROME? But we have only two guesses left after this? Third was this guess? No, we are making the fourth guess.

Let's count:
Guess 1: SLATE
Guess 2: PRONE
Guess 3: GROVE
Now we are on Guess 4.

We have two more guesses (5 and 6) if needed.

So if we guess BROKE and it's incorrect, we get feedback:
- B(x), R(✓), O(✓), K(x), E(✓) if the word is FROZE or BROME? Wait, if the word is FROZE, then BROKE:
  Position1: B → not in FROZE → x
  Position2: R → matched → ✓
  Position3: O → matched → ✓
  Position4: K → not in FROZE → x
  Position5: E → matched → ✓
Then we know B and K are not in the word, so BROME cannot be (BROME has B) so FROZE must be the word.

Similarly, if the word is BROME, and we guess BROKE:
- B: correct? In BROME, B is in position1 → but in BROKE, it's also position1. Since they match, it would be ✓? Or is BROME has B at position1, so in BROKE, B is in position1 and correct → ✓
But K is at position4? In BROME, position4 is M, so K is not present → x

So for BROKE when the real word is BROME:
B(✓) R(✓) O(✓) K(x) E(✓) → because K is not in BROME.

Then we know K is not in, but B is in? But we already have B at position1.

So we know the word is BROME because position4 was K, but it's wrong, so it must be M.

Even without guessing, if we get B(✓) and K(x), and we know the pattern, we can infer BROME.

Similarly, if we get all ✓, it's BROKE.

So if we guess BROKE:
- If it's correct: win.
- If not, and we get B(✓), K(x): then BROME is the word.
- If we get B(x), K(x): then FROZE is the word (since no other candidates).

We don't even need to guess further? With the feedback, we will know which one it is.

Similarly, if we guess BROME and it's wrong, we can deduce similarly.

So BROKE is a good guess.

Therefore, I will guess BROKE.

Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: SLATE** → E(✓) is confirmed at position 5, and S(x), L(x), A(x), T(x) are excluded.
- **Guess 2: PRONE** → R(✓) at position 2, O(✓) at position 3, E(✓) at position 5 confirmed. P(x) and N(x) are excluded.
- **Guess 3: GROVE** → R(✓), O(✓), E(✓) reconfirm positions 2, 3, and 5. G(x) and V(x) are excluded.

### Deductions:
- The secret word must match the pattern: `[letter1] R O [letter4] E` (fixed positions: 2=R, 3=O, 5=E).
- **Excluded letters**: S, L, A, T, P, N, G, V (all marked ""x"").
- **Available letters** (not excluded or confirmed): B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.
- With no duplicate letters indicated, assume the word has distinct letters.

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Must test `? R O ? E` using the available letters.
- Common valid words remaining are **BROKE** (tests B and K), **BROME** (tests B and M), and **FROZE** (tests F and Z).
- Prioritize **BROKE**:  
  - Tests **B** and **K**, which are high-frequency letters.  
  - Feedback will immediately identify the word:  
    - If BROKE is correct, solve.  
    - If B(✓) and K(x) → word is **BROME**.  
    - If B(x) and K(x) → word is **FROZE**.  
- This maximizes information with one guess, leveraging the fixed R, O, E positions.

<guess>BROKE</guess>",BROKE,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: SLATE -> S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: PRONE -> P(x) R(✓) O(✓) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: GROVE -> G(x) R(✓) O(✓) V(x) E(✓)

From this, we know:
- E is in position 5 and correct (from all guesses).
- R is in position 2 and correct (since in both guess2 and guess3).
- O is in position 3 and correct (same as above).
- The following letters are NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, P, N, G, V (all marked with 'x' in feedback).

Additionally, the pattern of the word is: [unknown1] R O [unknown2] E

The exclusions mean the unknown1 and unknown2 positions must be filled with letters not in {S, L, A, T, P, N, G, V} and also not R, O, E (assuming no duplicates, as we have no evidence of duplicates). So excluded letters: A, E, G, L, N, O, P, R, S, T, V.

Available letters: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, we need to find a word of the form ? R O ? E using the available letters.

Possible words include:
- BROKE: B and K are available.
- FROZE: F and Z are available.
- Other possibilities: We had BROKE and FROZE before, but also consider if there are others.

Since GROVE was guessed and V is not in the word, DROVE is out (because it has V). Similarly, GROVE itself is out because G is not in the word.

So the remaining candidates from before are BROKE and FROZE.

But are there others?
- CROME? Not a valid word.
- PROLE? P is excluded.
- WRITE? T is excluded and doesn't end with E.
- BRINE? But N is excluded.

How about:
- CROKE? Not a word.
- FROME? Not a word.
- WROKE? Not common, and W is available.

Another possible word: ""BROME"" – but we tried BROME? Earlier we thought not common, and also N? Wait, BROME: B R O M E? M is available. And BROME is a valid word (a type of grass). But N is excluded? BROME has M, not N. Spell: B-R-O-M-E.

Position: B R O M E -> so first letter B, fourth letter M. Pattern ? R O ? E matches. And M is not excluded.

Also, ""CRORE""? But C R O R E – duplicates R? And pattern would be C R O R E, which has R in position 4 too? Not matching the pattern ? R O ? E (it has O in position 3, R in 4, but we need a letter in position 4 that is not R). And letter2 is R, but letter4 is R again.

We have B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z for position1 and position4.

So BROKE: B and K.
FROZE: F and Z.
BROME: B and M.

Also, DROME? D and M. DROME is an abbreviation or less common? Not familiar.

Or CHORE? But O is position 3, and pattern requires position 3 to be O, but CHORE: C H O R E -> position2 is H, not R. So no.

WRITE: doesn't have O in position3 and T excluded.

So common candidates: BROKE, FROZE, BROME.

We could have ""TRODE"" but T is excluded.

""IRONE""? Not standard.

So we have three candidates: BROKE (B,R,O,K,E), FROZE (F,R,O,Z,E), BROME (B,R,O,M,E).

Now, note that in our previous guess GROVE, we got V(x), so V is not in the word, which confirms DROVE and GROVE are invalid.

Now, we need to guess one of these or a new word.

But we are constrained to the pattern ? R O ? E.

To choose among BROKE, FROZE, BROME, we might pick one that covers common letters.

B appears in two of these (BROKE and BROME), so if we guess a word with B, we get information about B.

Similarly, we could guess BROME to test B and M.

If we guess BROKE:
- If correct, we win.
- If not, we know B and K are not in the word? But wait: if BROKE is not correct, then because we know R,O,E are fixed, only position1 and 4 are wrong. So if we get feedback that B and K are not present (x), then the word must be FROZE (since BROME would have B, so if B is x, then BROME is also invalid). Then FROZE would be left.

Similarly, if we guess BROME and it's wrong:
- If B and M are not present? Then FROZE must be the word.

If we guess FROZE and it's wrong, then BROKE or BROME is correct.

So to minimize worst-case, we can choose any.

But let's guess BROKE, as it is a very common word.

After that, if wrong, we can guess FROZE, and if wrong again, BROME? But we have only two guesses left after this? Third was this guess? No, we are making the fourth guess.

Let's count:
Guess 1: SLATE
Guess 2: PRONE
Guess 3: GROVE
Now we are on Guess 4.

We have two more guesses (5 and 6) if needed.

So if we guess BROKE and it's incorrect, we get feedback:
- B(x), R(✓), O(✓), K(x), E(✓) if the word is FROZE or BROME? Wait, if the word is FROZE, then BROKE:
  Position1: B → not in FROZE → x
  Position2: R → matched → ✓
  Position3: O → matched → ✓
  Position4: K → not in FROZE → x
  Position5: E → matched → ✓
Then we know B and K are not in the word, so BROME cannot be (BROME has B) so FROZE must be the word.

Similarly, if the word is BROME, and we guess BROKE:
- B: correct? In BROME, B is in position1 → but in BROKE, it's also position1. Since they match, it would be ✓? Or is BROME has B at position1, so in BROKE, B is in position1 and correct → ✓
But K is at position4? In BROME, position4 is M, so K is not present → x

So for BROKE when the real word is BROME:
B(✓) R(✓) O(✓) K(x) E(✓) → because K is not in BROME.

Then we know K is not in, but B is in? But we already have B at position1.

So we know the word is BROME because position4 was K, but it's wrong, so it must be M.

Even without guessing, if we get B(✓) and K(x), and we know the pattern, we can infer BROME.

Similarly, if we get all ✓, it's BROKE.

So if we guess BROKE:
- If it's correct: win.
- If not, and we get B(✓), K(x): then BROME is the word.
- If we get B(x), K(x): then FROZE is the word (since no other candidates).

We don't even need to guess further? With the feedback, we will know which one it is.

Similarly, if we guess BROME and it's wrong, we can deduce similarly.

So BROKE is a good guess.

Therefore, I will guess BROKE.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 3: GROVE** → R(✓), O(✓), E(✓) reconfirm positions 2, 3, and 5. G(x) and V(x) are excluded.
