We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically uses common letters and has no repeating letters to maximize information.

 Common letters in 5-letter English words: according to frequency analysis, letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C are common.

 We also want to cover multiple common letters and avoid repeats.

 One popular starting word is ""CRANE"", which covers C, R, A, N, E — all common letters.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"", ""CRATE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" for our first guess.

 However, note that the example in the instructions used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"". We don't have any constraints so we can choose any valid word.

 Another consideration: we might want to include at least two vowels. ""CRANE"" has A and E.

 I think ""CRANE"" is a solid choice.

 So, my first guess: CRANE
</think>
After analyzing common strategies for the first guess in Wordle, I've considered the importance of using a word that includes frequent letters and diverse vowels to maximize information. The word ""CRANE"" is an optimal choice because:
- It contains common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E)
- All letters are unique, ensuring broader coverage
- It avoids repeating letters from common frequency patterns (E, A, R being top letters)

This starting word provides a solid foundation for narrowing down possibilities based on the feedback.

We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x -> not in the word
 R: - -> in the word but wrong position
 A: x -> not in the word
 N: x -> not in the word
 E: - -> in the word but wrong position

 Therefore, we know:
   - The secret word contains R and E, but they are not in the positions as in ""crane"". 
        In ""crane"", R was in position 2 and E was in position 5, so in the secret word, R cannot be in position 2 and E cannot be in position 5.
   - The letters C, A, N are not in the word at all.

 We must choose a new 5-letter word that includes R and E (at least) and does not include C, A, N.

 Also, we need to consider the positions. Since R was in position 2 in the guess but is not in that position in the secret, we must avoid putting R in position 2 again. Similarly, E is not in position 5.

 Let's think of words that have R and E, but without C, A, N.

 Some common letters: we also want to test other common letters to get more information.

 The secret word has R and E, so let's try to put R in a different position and E in a different position.

 Positions: 1,2,3,4,5

 We know R cannot be in position 2. So R can be in 1,3,4, or 5? But wait: the feedback only tells us that in the secret word, R is not in position 2. It could be elsewhere.

 Similarly, E cannot be in position 5. So E can be in 1,2,3, or 4.

 We don't have any correct position yet.

 Let's think of words that include R and E and avoid C,A,N.

 Some ideas: 
   words like ""ROUTE"", ""PRIDE"", ""BRUTE"", ""GRIEF"", but note:

   - ""ROUTE"": contains T and U. Also, R is in position 1, E in position 5 -> but E cannot be in position 5? Wait, the feedback said E is in the word but not in position 5. So if we put E in position 5, that's invalid? Actually, no: the feedback only said it's not in position 5 in the secret word, so we shouldn't put E in position 5 in a guess? Not exactly. We can put E in position 5 again? But it would be wasteful because we know it's not there. So to test other positions, we should put E in a different position.

 We should avoid repeating the known incorrect positions for R (position 2) and E (position 5). So in our next guess, we can try R in positions 1,3,4 and E in positions 1,2,3,4.

 Also, we must avoid letters C, A, N.

 Let me try to think of a word that uses other common letters: perhaps S, T, L, I, O, etc.

 One word that comes to mind: ""STORE""
   S: new letter
   T: new letter
   O: new letter
   R: known to be in the word, we put it in position 4? 
   E: known to be in the word, we put it in position 5? -> but wait, we know E is not in position 5 in the secret word. However, in our guess putting E in position 5 is allowed? But if we do that and get E( - ) again, we'll know E is also not in position 5? We already know that! So it's redundant.

 Actually, we know E is not in position 5. So we shouldn't put E in position 5 because if we do, we'll get ""-"" again and learn nothing new about E? So better to try E in a new position.

 Similarly for R: avoid position 2.

 So avoid:
   R in position 2
   E in position 5

 Also, note: we don't know if there are duplicate letters? The rules don't say, so I assume no duplicates? Actually, Wordle can have duplicates? But typically we avoid unless we know? Actually, the rules say ""each letter"", so duplicates might be possible? But let's assume no duplicates until we have evidence? Or we can consider both? Since no feedback about duplicates, we'll assume the secret word has all unique letters? The example didn't have duplicates.

 I think we'll stick with unique letters.

 So let's try to use a word that has R and E in new positions and also tests three new letters.

 How about: ""PRIME""
   P: new
   R: in position 2 -> wait, we must avoid position 2 for R? Because in the secret word R is not in position 2? But in our guess, placing R in position 2 is allowed? However, if we put R in position 2, then the feedback would be ""-"" (since R is in the word but not in that position) and we already know that. So it's better to try R in a new position to see if we can get a ""✓"".

 Since R could be in other positions (1,3,4), we should try one of those.

 Similarly for E: cannot be in position 5? So avoid position 5 for E.

 So let's not put R in position 2 and not put E in position 5.

 Consider ""PRIME"":
   P in pos1
   R in pos2 -> we avoid R in pos2? We shouldn't be putting R in pos2 because we know it's not there? So no learning? But note: we might get feedback that R is not in pos2? But we already know that. So better to put R in a position we haven't tested.

 Let me think of words with R and E in new positions.

 How about ""RULER"": but has duplicate R? Avoid for now.

 How about ""ROUSE"": 
   R at pos1 -> good, not position 2
   O at pos2
   U at pos3
   S at pos4
   E at pos5 -> but we know E is not in position 5, so we can move E to a different position? 

 Alternatively, ""RISEN"": but A and N are not allowed? We have N forbidden? ""RISEN"" has N -> not allowed.

 How about ""TRIBE""? 
   T at pos1
   R at pos2? -> again, we must avoid R in pos2? 

 How about ""ROGUE""? 
   R: pos1 -> good
   O: pos2
   G: pos3
   U: pos4
   E: pos5 -> but E in pos5? Not allowed? We are going to get that it's not there? So avoid.

 How about ""RADIO""? -> but A is forbidden? No, avoid.

 How about ""PARTY""? -> has A? not allowed.

 Another idea: ""REPLY""
   R in pos1 -> new position (not pos2)
   E in pos2 -> new for E (previously was in pos5, now pos2)
   P, L, Y: new letters

 This seems good.

 But we must avoid forbidden letters: no C, A, N -> ""REPLY"" has R, E, P, L, Y -> none of these are forbidden? And we have R and E.

 So ""REPLY"" has:
   R in position 1 (previously position 2) -> we'll see if it's correct?
   E in position 2 (previously position 5) -> testing a new position for E.
   Then P,L,Y are new.

 This is a valid word.

 Alternatively, ""POISE"" -> has E? But we put E in pos5? Not good.

 ""DRIVE"": D? D is new? R in position 2? avoid R in position 2 -> D in pos1, R in pos2 -> R in pos2 again? not efficient.

 ""INERT"": avoids forbidden? I,N,E,R,T? I and N: N is forbidden? So no.

 ""QUERY"": has Q? Q is uncommon? Maybe.

 But let's stick with ""REPLY"": 

   If the secret word has R in position 1, then we get R(✓). If not, then we'll get R(-) meaning it's elsewhere?
   Similarly, E in position 2: if correct, we get E(✓), else (-).

  This gives us information.

 But note: we know R is in the word and not in position 2. Now putting R in position 1 might be good because it's a new position? Similarly for E.

 So I think ""REPLY"" is a good guess.

 Another possibility: ""PUREE""? Duplicate E? Not good.

 Or ""WIDER"": letter W? but we might test a common letter? Actually, ""REPLY"" uses common letters: R, E, P, L, Y.

 Let me check if ""REPLY"" is a valid word: yes.

 So I choose ""REPLY"".

### Reasoning for Next Guess

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- **C**, **A**, **N** are **NOT** in the secret word (marked `x`).
- **R** and **E** are in the word but in the **WRONG positions** (marked `-`). Specifically:  
  - R cannot be in position 2.  
  - E cannot be in position 5.

#### Constraints for the next guess:
1. Must include:
   - **R** (anywhere except position 2).
   - **E** (anywhere except position 5).
2. Must **exclude** letters **C**, **A**, **N**.
3. Should prioritize new common letters to gather more information (e.g., S, T, L, I, O, P, Y).

#### Strategy:
- Place **R** in a new untested position (e.g., position 1, 3, or 4) to potentially identify its location.
- Place **E** in a new untested position (e.g., position 1, 2, 3, or 4) to narrow down its location.
- Test other frequent letters to maximize coverage of uneliminated alphabet.

#### Selected word: **REPLY**
- Breakdown:
  - **R** in position 1 (tests a new position for R, avoiding position 2).
  - **E** in position 2 (tests a new position for E, avoiding position 5).
  - **P**, **L**, **Y** are new high-frequency letters not yet tested.
- Validity:
  - Avoids forbidden letters (C, A, N).
  - Contains required letters (R and E).
  - Positions adhere to feedback constraints.

This guess efficiently leverages previous feedback to probe new positions and letters, helping isolate the secret word.

<guess>reply</guess>",reply,"We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x -> not in the word

We can put E in position 5 again? But it would be wasteful because we know it's not there. So to test other positions, we should put E in a different position.

 We should avoid repeating the known incorrect positions for R (position 2) and E (position 5). So in our next guess, we can try R in positions 1,3,4 and E in positions 1,2,3,4.

 Also, we must avoid letters C, A, N.

 Let me try to think of a word that uses other common letters: perhaps S, T, L, I, O, etc.

 One word that comes to mind: ""STORE""
   S: new letter
   T: new letter
   O: new letter

 Similarly for R: avoid position 2.

 So avoid:
   R in position 2
   E in position 5

 Also, note: we don't know if there are duplicate letters? The rules don't say, so I assume no duplicates? Actually, Wordle can have duplicates? But typically we avoid unless we know? Actually, the rules say ""each letter"", so duplicates might be possible? But let's assume no duplicates until we have evidence? Or we can consider both?

 How about ""ROGUE""? 
   R: pos1 -> good
   O: pos2

   U: pos4
   E: pos5 -> but E in pos5? Not allowed? We are going to get that it's not there? So avoid.

 How about ""RADIO""? -> but A is forbidden? No, avoid.

 How about ""PARTY""? -> has A? not allowed.

 Another idea: ""REPLY""
   R in pos1 -> new position (not pos2)
   E in pos2 -> new for E (previously was in pos5, now pos2)

 But we must avoid forbidden letters: no C, A, N -> ""REPLY"" has R, E, P, L, Y -> none of these are forbidden? And we have R and E.

 So ""REPLY"" has:
   R in position 1 (previously position 2) -> we'll see if it's correct?
   E in position 2 (previously position 5) -> testing a new position for E.
   Then P,L,Y are new.

 This is a valid word.

 Alternatively, ""POISE"" -> has E? But we put E in pos5? Not good.

 ""DRIVE"": D? D is new? R in position 2? avoid R in position 2 -> D in pos1, R in pos2 -> R in pos2 again? not efficient.

 ""INERT"": avoids forbidden? I,N,E,R,T? I and N: N is forbidden? So no.

 ""QUERY"": has Q? Q is uncommon? Maybe.

 But let's stick with ""REPLY"": 

   If the secret word has R in position 1, then we get R(✓). If not, then we'll get R(-) meaning it's elsewhere?

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically uses common letters and has no repeating letters to maximize information.

 Common letters in 5-letter English words: according to frequency analysis, letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C are common.

 We also want to cover multiple common letters and avoid repeats.

 One popular starting word is ""CRANE"", which covers C, R, A, N, E — all common letters.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"", ""CRATE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" for our first guess.

 However, note that the example in the instructions used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"". We don't have any constraints so we can choose any valid word.

 Another consideration: we might want to include at least two vowels. ""CRANE"" has A and E.

 I think ""CRANE"" is a solid choice.

 So, my first guess: CRANEAfter analyzing common strategies for the first guess in Wordle, I've considered the importance of using a word that includes frequent letters and diverse vowels to maximize information. The word ""CRANE"" is an optimal choice because:
- It contains common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E)
- All letters are unique, ensuring broader coverage
- It avoids repeating letters from common frequency patterns (E, A, R being top letters)

This starting word provides a solid foundation for narrowing down possibilities based on the feedback.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x -> not in the word
 R: - -> in the word but wrong position
 A: x -> not in the word
 N: x -> not in the word
 E: - -> in the word but wrong position

 Therefore, we know:
   - The secret word contains R and E, but they are not in the positions as in ""crane"". 
        In ""crane"", R was in position 2 and E was in position 5, so in the secret word, R cannot be in position 2 and E cannot be in position 5.
   - The letters C, A, N are not in the word at all.

 We must choose a new 5-letter word that includes R and E (at least) and does not include C, A, N.

 Also, we need to consider the positions. Since R was in position 2 in the guess but is not in that position in the secret, we must avoid putting R in position 2 again. Similarly, E is not in position 5.

 Let's think of words that have R and E, but without C, A, N.

 Some common letters: we also want to test other common letters to get more information.

 The secret word has R and E, so let's try to put R in a different position and E in a different position.

 Positions: 1,2,3,4,5

 We know R cannot be in position 2. So R can be in 1,3,4, or 5? But wait: the feedback only tells us that in the secret word, R is not in position 2. It could be elsewhere.

 Similarly, E cannot be in position 5. So E can be in 1,2,3, or 4.

 We don't have any correct position yet.

 Let's think of words that include R and E and avoid C,A,N.

 Some ideas: 
   words like ""ROUTE"", ""PRIDE"", ""BRUTE"", ""GRIEF"", but note:

   - ""ROUTE"": contains T and U. Also, R is in position 1, E in position 5 -> but E cannot be in position 5? Wait, the feedback said E is in the word but not in position 5. So if we put E in position 5, that's invalid? Actually, no: the feedback only said it's not in position 5 in the secret word, so we shouldn't put E in position 5 in a guess? Not exactly. We can put E in position 5 again? But it would be wasteful because we know it's not there. So to test other positions, we should put E in a different position.

 We should avoid repeating the known incorrect positions for R (position 2) and E (position 5). So in our next guess, we can try R in positions 1,3,4 and E in positions 1,2,3,4.

 Also, we must avoid letters C, A, N.

 Let me try to think of a word that uses other common letters: perhaps S, T, L, I, O, etc.

 One word that comes to mind: ""STORE""
   S: new letter
   T: new letter
   O: new letter
   R: known to be in the word, we put it in position 4? 
   E: known to be in the word, we put it in position 5? -> but wait, we know E is not in position 5 in the secret word. However, in our guess putting E in position 5 is allowed? But if we do that and get E( - ) again, we'll know E is also not in position 5? We already know that! So it's redundant.

 Actually, we know E is not in position 5. So we shouldn't put E in position 5 because if we do, we'll get ""-"" again and learn nothing new about E? So better to try E in a new position.

 Similarly for R: avoid position 2.

 So avoid:
   R in position 2
   E in position 5

 Also, note: we don't know if there are duplicate letters? The rules don't say, so I assume no duplicates? Actually, Wordle can have duplicates? But typically we avoid unless we know? Actually, the rules say ""each letter"", so duplicates might be possible? But let's assume no duplicates until we have evidence? Or we can consider both? Since no feedback about duplicates, we'll assume the secret word has all unique letters? The example didn't have duplicates.

 I think we'll stick with unique letters.

 So let's try to use a word that has R and E in new positions and also tests three new letters.

 How about: ""PRIME""
   P: new
   R: in position 2 -> wait, we must avoid position 2 for R? Because in the secret word R is not in position 2? But in our guess, placing R in position 2 is allowed? However, if we put R in position 2, then the feedback would be ""-"" (since R is in the word but not in that position) and we already know that. So it's better to try R in a new position to see if we can get a ""✓"".

 Since R could be in other positions (1,3,4), we should try one of those.

 Similarly for E: cannot be in position 5? So avoid position 5 for E.

 So let's not put R in position 2 and not put E in position 5.

 Consider ""PRIME"":
   P in pos1
   R in pos2 -> we avoid R in pos2? We shouldn't be putting R in pos2 because we know it's not there? So no learning? But note: we might get feedback that R is not in pos2? But we already know that. So better to put R in a position we haven't tested.

 Let me think of words with R and E in new positions.

 How about ""RULER"": but has duplicate R? Avoid for now.

 How about ""ROUSE"": 
   R at pos1 -> good, not position 2
   O at pos2
   U at pos3
   S at pos4
   E at pos5 -> but we know E is not in position 5, so we can move E to a different position? 

 Alternatively, ""RISEN"": but A and N are not allowed? We have N forbidden? ""RISEN"" has N -> not allowed.

 How about ""TRIBE""? 
   T at pos1
   R at pos2? -> again, we must avoid R in pos2? 

 How about ""ROGUE""? 
   R: pos1 -> good
   O: pos2
   G: pos3
   U: pos4
   E: pos5 -> but E in pos5? Not allowed? We are going to get that it's not there? So avoid.

 How about ""RADIO""? -> but A is forbidden? No, avoid.

 How about ""PARTY""? -> has A? not allowed.

 Another idea: ""REPLY""
   R in pos1 -> new position (not pos2)
   E in pos2 -> new for E (previously was in pos5, now pos2)
   P, L, Y: new letters

 This seems good.

 But we must avoid forbidden letters: no C, A, N -> ""REPLY"" has R, E, P, L, Y -> none of these are forbidden? And we have R and E.

 So ""REPLY"" has:
   R in position 1 (previously position 2) -> we'll see if it's correct?
   E in position 2 (previously position 5) -> testing a new position for E.
   Then P,L,Y are new.

 This is a valid word.

 Alternatively, ""POISE"" -> has E? But we put E in pos5? Not good.

 ""DRIVE"": D? D is new? R in position 2? avoid R in position 2 -> D in pos1, R in pos2 -> R in pos2 again? not efficient.

 ""INERT"": avoids forbidden? I,N,E,R,T? I and N: N is forbidden? So no.

 ""QUERY"": has Q? Q is uncommon? Maybe.

 But let's stick with ""REPLY"": 

   If the secret word has R in position 1, then we get R(✓). If not, then we'll get R(-) meaning it's elsewhere?
   Similarly, E in position 2: if correct, we get E(✓), else (-).

  This gives us information.

 But note: we know R is in the word and not in position 2. Now putting R in position 1 might be good because it's a new position? Similarly for E.

 So I think ""REPLY"" is a good guess.

 Another possibility: ""PUREE""? Duplicate E? Not good.

 Or ""WIDER"": letter W? but we might test a common letter? Actually, ""REPLY"" uses common letters: R, E, P, L, Y.

 Let me check if ""REPLY"" is a valid word: yes.

 So I choose ""REPLY"".

<guess>reply</guess>### Reasoning for Next Guess

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- **C**, **A**, **N** are **NOT** in the secret word (marked `x`).
- **R** and **E** are in the word but in the **WRONG positions** (marked `-`). Specifically:  
  - R cannot be in position 2.  
  - E cannot be in position 5.

#### Constraints for the next guess:
1. Must include:
   - **R** (anywhere except position 2).
   - **E** (anywhere except position 5).
2. Must **exclude** letters **C**, **A**, **N**.
3. Should prioritize new common letters to gather more information (e.g., S, T, L, I, O, P, Y).

#### Strategy:
- Place **R** in a new untested position (e.g., position 1, 3, or 4) to potentially identify its location.
- Place **E** in a new untested position (e.g., position 1, 2, 3, or 4) to narrow down its location.
- Test other frequent letters to maximize coverage of uneliminated alphabet.

#### Selected word: **REPLY**
- Breakdown:
  - **R** in position 1 (tests a new position for R, avoiding position 2).
  - **E** in position 2 (tests a new position for E, avoiding position 5).
  - **P**, **L**, **Y** are new high-frequency letters not yet tested.
- Validity:
  - Avoids forbidden letters (C, A, N).
  - Contains required letters (R and E).
  - Positions adhere to feedback constraints.

This guess efficiently leverages previous feedback to probe new positions and letters, helping isolate the secret word.

We have two rounds of feedback:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: - (in word, wrong position)
  A: x (not in word)
  N: x (not in word)
  E: - (in word, wrong position)

Guess 2: ""reply""
  R: - (in word, wrong position) -> so R is in the word but not in position 1 (from reply) and not in position 2 (from crane)
  E: - (in word, wrong position) -> so E is in the word but not in position 2 (from reply) and not in position 5 (from crane)
  P: x (not in word)
  L: x (not in word)
  Y: x (not in word)

So now we know:
- The secret word contains R and E, and does not contain C, A, N, P, L, Y.
- R cannot be in positions 1 or 2.
- E cannot be in positions 2 or 5.

Since the word is 5 letters, R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

We also know that the word does not have: C, A, N, P, L, Y.

We need to think of a word that includes R and E (and no forbidden letters) and places R in one of {3,4,5} and E in one of {1,3,4}. Also, we want to test new common letters to get more information.

Common letters left: S, T, O, I, D, H, U, M, B, G, etc.

We should avoid repeating positions for R and E that we know are wrong? Actually, we are forced to put R in 3,4,5 and E in 1,3,4. But note: if we put R and E in the same position? That's not possible because they are different letters. Also, we don't know if they can be in the same position? But positions are for different letters.

We can try to put R and E in positions we haven't tried and also test other letters.

Let's list possible positions for R: 3,4,5
For E: 1,3,4

But note: if we put E in position 3 and R in position 3, that's impossible? No, because they are in the same position? But one position can only have one letter. So we cannot put both E and R in position 3 in the same guess? Actually, in a word, each position has one letter. So in our guess, we can only put one letter per position.

So we have to assign R to one of 3,4,5 and E to one of 1,3,4, but they cannot be in the same position. So if we assign E to 3, then R cannot be in 3? So R must be in 4 or 5. Similarly, if we assign R to 3, then E cannot be in 3? So E must be in 1 or 4.

We want to maximize information. So we should try to cover new positions and new letters.

Let me think of words that have R and E and avoid the forbidden letters.

Forbidden letters: C, A, N, P, L, Y.

Possible words: 
  We can try words like ""TIGER"", but let's check:
    T in pos1, I in pos2, G in pos3, E in pos4, R in pos5.
    This uses T, I, G, E, R.

  Check positions for E and R:
    E is in position 4 -> which is allowed (since E can be in 1,3,4 and 4 is allowed, and not 2 or 5)
    R is in position 5 -> which is allowed (R can be in 3,4,5, and 5 is allowed, and not 1 or 2)

  Also, we test T, I, G.

  But is ""TIGER"" a valid word? Yes.

  However, we don't know if the secret word has G or I? But that's the point: we are testing new letters.

Another possibility: ""TIMER"" -> but M is new? But ""TIMER"" has M? And E and R: E in pos4, R in pos5? Same as above? But we also test M? Actually, ""TIMER"" is T,I,M,E,R.

But we have two options. We can also consider ""RIVER"": but R in position 1? Not allowed? Because we know R is not in position 1? So we cannot put R in position 1? We must avoid position 1 for R? Because from ""reply"", R in position 1 got a ""-"", meaning it's in the word but not in position 1? So we must not put R in position 1 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient? Because we know it's not there? So we avoid.

Similarly, we avoid R in position 2 and E in position 2 and 5.

So ""TIGER"" has R in position 5 and E in position 4? That's good.

Another word: ""BORED"" -> B,O,R,E,D. 
  R in position 3? (B:1, O:2, R:3, E:4, D:5) 
  But E is in position 4? and R in position 3? 
  Also, we test B, O, D.

But we have to avoid forbidden letters? B,O,D are not forbidden? So that's okay.

But note: in ""BORED"", E is in position 4? and R in position 3? 
  We know E can be in 1,3,4? So 4 is okay? 
  R can be in 3,4,5? So 3 is okay.

But we also have to consider that we are testing O and B and D.

Another word: ""SERUM"" -> S,E,R,U,M. 
  But E is in position 2? We know E cannot be in position 2? Because from ""reply"", E in position 2 got a ""-"", meaning it's in the word but not in position 2? So we should avoid putting E in position 2? Because we already know it's not there? So we avoid.

Similarly, we avoid positions that we know are wrong for E and R.

So for E, avoid positions 2 and 5? So only 1,3,4? 
For R, avoid 1 and 2? So only 3,4,5.

So in ""SERUM"", E is in position 2? That's not allowed? So we skip.

How about ""RESIN""? But N is forbidden? So no.

""DRIVE"": D,R,I,V,E -> R in position 2? Avoid? R cannot be in position 2? So skip.

""OWLER""? But L is forbidden? Skip.

""QUEER""? Duplicate E? And Q? But also, E in position 3 and 5? But position 5 is forbidden for E? And we have duplicate? Not ideal? Also, Q is uncommon.

So let's stick with ""TIGER"" or ""BORED"".

But we have to choose one.

Another idea: ""TUNER""? But U and N? N is forbidden? Skip.

""RODEO""? But O and D? And A? No, ""RODEO"" has A? No, R,O,D,E,O? Duplicate O? And E in position 4? But R in position 1? Avoid R in position 1? So skip.

""GRIME""? G,R,I,M,E -> R in position 2? Avoid? Skip.

""BRIDE""? B,R,I,D,E -> R in position 2? Avoid? Skip.

""WROTE""? W,R,O,T,E -> R in position 2? Avoid? Skip.

""CRWTH""? Not a common word? And has C? Forbidden? Skip.

So back to ""TIGER"" and ""BORED"".

We can also consider ""HOMER""? H,O,M,E,R -> E in position 4, R in position 5? That's good? And we test H,O,M.

But ""HOMER"" is a valid word.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test as many new common letters as possible.

Common letters: S, T, O, I, D, H, M, etc.

In ""TIGER"": T, I, G, E, R -> tests T, I, G.
In ""BORED"": B, O, R, E, D -> tests B, O, D.
In ""HOMER"": H, O, M, E, R -> tests H, O, M.

We don't know which are more common? But in English, T, O, I, D are more common than G, B, H? 

But we have to consider that we have limited guesses. We have 3 more guesses? Actually, we have 4 left? We used 2, so 4 left? But we want to solve in as few as possible.

Another idea: ""TOWER""? But W? And E in position 5? Avoid? Skip.

""RIDER""? R in position 1? Avoid? And duplicate R? Skip.

""FRIED""? F,R,I,E,D -> R in position 2? Avoid? Skip.

So I think ""TIGER"" is a good choice.

But let me check if there is a word that uses S? Because S is very common.

How about ""TERMS""? T,E,R,M,S -> but E in position 2? Avoid? Skip.

""STERN""? S,T,E,R,N -> but N is forbidden? Skip.

""STEER""? Duplicate E? And E in position 5? Avoid? Skip.

""RESTY""? But Y is forbidden? Skip.

""RESET""? E in position 2? Avoid? And duplicate E? Skip.

So it's hard to include S without putting E in a bad position? Or using forbidden letters.

Another word: ""DETER""? D,E,T,E,R -> duplicate E? And E in position 2? Avoid? Skip.

""ENTER""? E in position 1? But N is forbidden? Skip.

""EMPTY""? E in position 1? Then M,P,T,Y? But P and Y are forbidden? Skip.

So perhaps ""TIGER"" is acceptable.

But we have to make sure that we don't put R and E in positions that conflict? In ""TIGER"", R is in 5 and E is in 4? That's fine.

We can also consider ""ROUGE""? But U and G? And E in position 5? Avoid? Skip.

""RANGE""? But A and N? Forbidden? Skip.

So I think ""TIGER"" is a good guess.

But let's see the positions: 
  Position 1: T
  Position 2: I
  Position 3: G
  Position 4: E
  Position 5: R

We know E must be in 1,3, or 4? Here we put E in 4? So if it's correct, we get E(✓). If not, then E must be in 1 or 3? Similarly, R in 5? If correct, R(✓), else R must be in 3 or 4? But note: if R is in 5, then we get R(✓). If not, then R is in 3 or 4? But we have E in 4? So if R is in 4, then E cannot be in 4? So we have to be careful? Actually, in the secret word, R and E are in different positions? So if we get feedback that E is not in 4, then we know E is in 1 or 3? And if R is not in 5, then R is in 3 or 4? But if R is in 4, then E cannot be in 4? So that's consistent.

But we are testing: we might get a ✓ for E or R? Or both? Or neither? But we'll get information.

Alternatively, we could try to put E in position 1? For example, ""EARTH""? But A is forbidden? Skip.

""EERIE""? Duplicate E? Skip.

""EXIST""? E in position 1? Then X,I,S,T? But X is uncommon? And we have to avoid S? No, S is allowed? But we don't know? We haven't tested S? But in ""EXIST"", E in position 1? That's allowed? But we test X? Not common.

""EDGES""? E in position 1? Then D,G,E,S? Duplicate E? Skip.

So it's hard to put E in position 1 without using forbidden letters or duplicates.

Similarly, for position 3: we could put E in position 3? For example, ""THREW""? T,H,R,E,W -> R in position 3? But we put R in position 3? Then E in position 4? Wait, ""THREW"": T1, H2, R3, E4, W5? So E in 4? Not 3? 

""ALERT""? A forbidden? Skip.

""BERTH""? B,E,R,T,H -> E in position 2? Avoid? Skip.

""MERIT""? M,E,R,I,T -> E in position 2? Avoid? Skip.

""PERIL""? P forbidden? Skip.

So I think ""TIGER"" is a reasonable choice.

Therefore, I'll go with ""TIGER"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback:
- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: 
  - C (x): Not in the word.
  - R (-): In the word, but not in position 2.
  - A (x): Not in the word.
  - N (x): Not in the word.
  - E (-): In the word, but not in position 5.

- **Guess 2 (REPLY)**:
  - R (-): In the word, but not in position 1 (confirms R is not in position 2 from Guess 1).
  - E (-): In the word, but not in position 2 (confirms E is not in position 5 from Guess 1).
  - P (x): Not in the word.
  - L (x): Not in the word.
  - Y (x): Not in the word.

### Key Constraints Derived:
1. **Confirmed letters in the secret word**: 
   - **R** and **E** must appear, but their positions are unknown.
2. **Eliminated letters**: 
   - C, A, N, P, L, Y are **not** in the word.
3. **Position constraints**:
   - **R**: Cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (must be in 3, 4, or 5).
   - **E**: Cannot be in positions 2 or 5 (must be in 1, 3, or 4).
4. **Other**: 
   - The word has no duplicates (based on standard Wordle rules and feedback).
   - Remaining letters to test: High-frequency consonants (e.g., S, T, D, M, B, G) and vowels (O, I, U).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Include R and E** in new positions to narrow down their locations:
  - R must be placed in position 3, 4, or 5.
  - E must be placed in position 1, 3, or 4 (but cannot share the same position as R).
- **Test new common letters**: Prioritize S, T, O, I, D, G, or M to maximize information.
- **Avoid eliminated letters**: C, A, N, P, L, Y.

### Why ""TIGER""?
- **T** (new), **I** (new), **G** (new), **E**, **R**.
- **Position testing**:
  - E is in position 4 (valid, as E cannot be in 2/5 and position 4 is untested).
  - R is in position 5 (valid, as R cannot be in 1/2 and position 5 is untested).
- **Letter coverage**: Tests three new common letters (T, I, G) while adhering to constraints.
- **Word validity**: ""TIGER"" is a valid 5-letter word.

This guess efficiently narrows possible positions for R and E while probing new letters. If E or R appear in their guessed positions (✓), it directly reveals their locations. If not (-/x), it further constrains possibilities for the next guess.

<guess>tiger</guess>",tiger,"We have two rounds of feedback:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: - (in word, wrong position)
  A: x (not in word)
  N: x (not in word)
  E: - (in word, wrong position)

Guess 2: ""reply""
  R: - (in word, wrong position) -> so R is in the word but not in position 1 (from reply) and not in position 2 (from crane)
  E: - (in word, wrong position) -> so E is in the word but not in position 2 (from reply) and not in position 5 (from crane)
  P: x (not in word)
  L: x (not in word)
  Y: x (not in word)

So now we know:
- The secret word contains R and E, and does not contain C, A, N, P, L, Y.
- R cannot be in positions 1 or 2.
- E cannot be in positions 2 or 5.

Since the word is 5 letters, R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

We also know that the word does not have: C, A, N, P, L, Y.

We need to think of a word that includes R and E (and no forbidden letters) and places R in one of {3,4,5} and E in one of {1,3,4}. Also, we want to test new common letters to get more information.

Common letters left: S, T, O, I, D, H, U, M, B, G, etc.

We should avoid repeating positions for R and E that we know are wrong? Actually, we are forced to put R in 3,4,5 and E in 1,3,4. But note: if we put R and E in the same position? That's not possible because they are different letters. Also, we don't know if they can be in the same position? But positions are for different letters.

We can try to put R and E in positions we haven't tried and also test other letters.

Let's list possible positions for R: 3,4,5
For E: 1,3,4

But note: if we put E in position 3 and R in position 3, that's impossible? No, because they are in the same position? But one position can only have one letter. So we cannot put both E and R in position 3 in the same guess? Actually, in a word, each position has one letter. So in our guess, we can only put one letter per position.

So we have to assign R to one of 3,4,5 and E to one of 1,3,4, but they cannot be in the same position. So if we assign E to 3, then R cannot be in 3? So R must be in 4 or 5. Similarly, if we assign R to 3, then E cannot be in 3? So E must be in 1 or 4.

We want to maximize information. So we should try to cover new positions and new letters.

Let me think of words that have R and E and avoid the forbidden letters.

Forbidden letters: C, A, N, P, L, Y.

Possible words: 
  We can try words like ""TIGER"", but let's check:
    T in pos1, I in pos2, G in pos3, E in pos4, R in pos5.
    This uses T, I, G, E, R.

  Check positions for E and R:
    E is in position 4 -> which is allowed (since E can be in 1,3,4 and 4 is allowed, and not 2 or 5)
    R is in position 5 -> which is allowed (R can be in 3,4,5, and 5 is allowed, and not 1 or 2)

  Also, we test T, I, G.

  But is ""TIGER"" a valid word? Yes.

  However, we don't know if the secret word has G or I? But that's the point: we are testing new letters.

Another possibility: ""TIMER"" -> but M is new? But ""TIMER"" has M? And E and R: E in pos4, R in pos5? Same as above? But we also test M? Actually, ""TIMER"" is T,I,M,E,R.

But we have two options. We can also consider ""RIVER"": but R in position 1? Not allowed? Because we know R is not in position 1? So we cannot put R in position 1? We must avoid position 1 for R? Because from ""reply"", R in position 1 got a ""-"", meaning it's in the word but not in position 1? So we must not put R in position 1 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient? Because we know it's not there? So we avoid.

Similarly, we avoid R in position 2 and E in position 2 and 5.

So ""TIGER"" has R in position 5 and E in position 4? That's good.

Another word: ""BORED"" -> B,O,R,E,D. 
  R in position 3? (B:1, O:2, R:3, E:4, D:5) 
  But E is in position 4? and R in position 3? 
  Also, we test B, O, D.

But we have to avoid forbidden letters? B,O,D are not forbidden? So that's okay.

But note: in ""BORED"", E is in position 4? and R in position 3? 
  We know E can be in 1,3,4? So 4 is okay? 
  R can be in 3,4,5? So 3 is okay.

But we also have to consider that we are testing O and B and D.

Another word: ""SERUM"" -> S,E,R,U,M. 
  But E is in position 2? We know E cannot be in position 2? Because from ""reply"", E in position 2 got a ""-"", meaning it's in the word but not in position 2? So we should avoid putting E in position 2? Because we already know it's not there? So we avoid.

Similarly, we avoid positions that we know are wrong for E and R.

So for E, avoid positions 2 and 5? So only 1,3,4? 
For R, avoid 1 and 2? So only 3,4,5.

So in ""SERUM"", E is in position 2? That's not allowed? So we skip.

How about ""RESIN""? But N is forbidden? So no.

""DRIVE"": D,R,I,V,E -> R in position 2? Avoid? R cannot be in position 2? So skip.

""OWLER""? But L is forbidden? Skip.

""QUEER""? Duplicate E? And Q? But also, E in position 3 and 5? But position 5 is forbidden for E? And we have duplicate? Not ideal? Also, Q is uncommon.

So let's stick with ""TIGER"" or ""BORED"".

But we have to choose one.

Another idea: ""TUNER""? But U and N? N is forbidden? Skip.

""RODEO""? But O and D? And A? No, ""RODEO"" has A? No, R,O,D,E,O? Duplicate O? And E in position 4? But R in position 1? Avoid R in position 1? So skip.

""GRIME""? G,R,I,M,E -> R in position 2? Avoid? Skip.

""BRIDE""? B,R,I,D,E -> R in position 2? Avoid? Skip.

""WROTE""? W,R,O,T,E -> R in position 2? Avoid? Skip.

""CRWTH""? Not a common word? And has C? Forbidden? Skip.

So back to ""TIGER"" and ""BORED"".

We can also consider ""HOMER""? H,O,M,E,R -> E in position 4, R in position 5? That's good? And we test H,O,M.

But ""HOMER"" is a valid word.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test as many new common letters as possible.

Common letters: S, T, O, I, D, H, M, etc.

In ""TIGER"": T, I, G, E, R -> tests T, I, G.

""RESTY""? But Y is forbidden? Skip.

""RESET""? E in position 2? Avoid? And duplicate E? Skip.

So it's hard to include S without putting E in a bad position? Or using forbidden letters.

Another word: ""DETER""? D,E,T,E,R -> duplicate E? And E in position 2? Avoid? Skip.

""ENTER""? E in position 1? But N is forbidden? Skip.

""EMPTY""? E in position 1? Then M,P,T,Y? But P and Y are forbidden? Skip.

So perhaps ""TIGER"" is acceptable.

But we have to make sure that we don't put R and E in positions that conflict? In ""TIGER"", R is in 5 and E is in 4? That's fine.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically uses common letters and has no repeating letters to maximize information.

 Common letters in 5-letter English words: according to frequency analysis, letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C are common.

 We also want to cover multiple common letters and avoid repeats.

 One popular starting word is ""CRANE"", which covers C, R, A, N, E — all common letters.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"", ""CRATE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" for our first guess.

 However, note that the example in the instructions used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"". We don't have any constraints so we can choose any valid word.

 Another consideration: we might want to include at least two vowels. ""CRANE"" has A and E.

 I think ""CRANE"" is a solid choice.

 So, my first guess: CRANEAfter analyzing common strategies for the first guess in Wordle, I've considered the importance of using a word that includes frequent letters and diverse vowels to maximize information. The word ""CRANE"" is an optimal choice because:
- It contains common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E)
- All letters are unique, ensuring broader coverage
- It avoids repeating letters from common frequency patterns (E, A, R being top letters)

This starting word provides a solid foundation for narrowing down possibilities based on the feedback.

 E: - -> in the word but wrong position

 Therefore, we know:
   - The secret word contains R and E, but they are not in the positions as in ""crane"". 
        In ""crane"", R was in position 2 and E was in position 5, so in the secret word, R cannot be in position 2 and E cannot be in position 5.
   - The letters C, A, N are not in the word at all.

 We must choose a new 5-letter word that includes R and E (at least) and does not include C, A, N.

 Also, we need to consider the positions. Since R was in position 2 in the guess but is not in that position in the secret, we must avoid putting R in position 2 again. Similarly, E is not in position 5.

 Let's think of words that have R and E, but without C, A, N.

 Some common letters: we also want to test other common letters to get more information.

 The secret word has R and E, so let's try to put R in a different position and E in a different position.

 Positions: 1,2,3,4,5

 We know R cannot be in position 2. So R can be in 1,3,4, or 5? But wait: the feedback only tells us that in the secret word, R is not in position 2. It could be elsewhere.

 Similarly, E cannot be in position 5. So E can be in 1,2,3, or 4.

 We don't have any correct position yet.

 Let's think of words that include R and E and avoid C,A,N.

 Some ideas: 
   words like ""ROUTE"", ""PRIDE"", ""BRUTE"", ""GRIEF"", but note:

   - ""ROUTE"": contains T and U. Also, R is in position 1, E in position 5 -> but E cannot be in position 5? Wait, the feedback said E is in the word but not in position 5. So if we put E in position 5, that's invalid? Actually, no: the feedback only said it's not in position 5 in the secret word, so we shouldn't put E in position 5 in a guess? Not exactly. We can put E in position 5 again? But it would be wasteful because we know it's not there. So to test other positions, we should put E in a different position.

 We should avoid repeating the known incorrect positions for R (position 2) and E (position 5). So in our next guess, we can try R in positions 1,3,4 and E in positions 1,2,3,4.

 Also, we must avoid letters C, A, N.

 Let me try to think of a word that uses other common letters: perhaps S, T, L, I, O, etc.

 One word that comes to mind: ""STORE""
   S: new letter
   T: new letter
   O: new letter
   R: known to be in the word, we put it in position 4? 
   E: known to be in the word, we put it in position 5? -> but wait, we know E is not in position 5 in the secret word. However, in our guess putting E in position 5 is allowed? But if we do that and get E( - ) again, we'll know E is also not in position 5? We already know that! So it's redundant.

 Actually, we know E is not in position 5. So we shouldn't put E in position 5 because if we do, we'll get ""-"" again and learn nothing new about E? So better to try E in a new position.

 Similarly for R: avoid position 2.

 So avoid:
   R in position 2
   E in position 5

 Also, note: we don't know if there are duplicate letters? The rules don't say, so I assume no duplicates? Actually, Wordle can have duplicates? But typically we avoid unless we know? Actually, the rules say ""each letter"", so duplicates might be possible? But let's assume no duplicates until we have evidence? Or we can consider both? Since no feedback about duplicates, we'll assume the secret word has all unique letters? The example didn't have duplicates.

 I think we'll stick with unique letters.

 So let's try to use a word that has R and E in new positions and also tests three new letters.

 How about: ""PRIME""
   P: new
   R: in position 2 -> wait, we must avoid position 2 for R? Because in the secret word R is not in position 2? But in our guess, placing R in position 2 is allowed? However, if we put R in position 2, then the feedback would be ""-"" (since R is in the word but not in that position) and we already know that. So it's better to try R in a new position to see if we can get a ""✓"".

 Since R could be in other positions (1,3,4), we should try one of those.

 Similarly for E: cannot be in position 5? So avoid position 5 for E.

 So let's not put R in position 2 and not put E in position 5.

 Consider ""PRIME"":
   P in pos1
   R in pos2 -> we avoid R in pos2? We shouldn't be putting R in pos2 because we know it's not there? So no learning? But note: we might get feedback that R is not in pos2? But we already know that. So better to put R in a position we haven't tested.

 Let me think of words with R and E in new positions.

 How about ""RULER"": but has duplicate R? Avoid for now.

 How about ""ROUSE"": 
   R at pos1 -> good, not position 2
   O at pos2
   U at pos3
   S at pos4
   E at pos5 -> but we know E is not in position 5, so we can move E to a different position? 

 Alternatively, ""RISEN"": but A and N are not allowed? We have N forbidden? ""RISEN"" has N -> not allowed.

 How about ""TRIBE""? 
   T at pos1
   R at pos2? -> again, we must avoid R in pos2? 

 How about ""ROGUE""? 
   R: pos1 -> good
   O: pos2
   G: pos3
   U: pos4
   E: pos5 -> but E in pos5? Not allowed? We are going to get that it's not there? So avoid.

 How about ""RADIO""? -> but A is forbidden? No, avoid.

 How about ""PARTY""? -> has A? not allowed.

 Another idea: ""REPLY""
   R in pos1 -> new position (not pos2)
   E in pos2 -> new for E (previously was in pos5, now pos2)
   P, L, Y: new letters

 This seems good.

 But we must avoid forbidden letters: no C, A, N -> ""REPLY"" has R, E, P, L, Y -> none of these are forbidden? And we have R and E.

 So ""REPLY"" has:
   R in position 1 (previously position 2) -> we'll see if it's correct?
   E in position 2 (previously position 5) -> testing a new position for E.
   Then P,L,Y are new.

 This is a valid word.

 Alternatively, ""POISE"" -> has E? But we put E in pos5? Not good.

 ""DRIVE"": D? D is new? R in position 2? avoid R in position 2 -> D in pos1, R in pos2 -> R in pos2 again? not efficient.

 ""INERT"": avoids forbidden? I,N,E,R,T? I and N: N is forbidden? So no.

 ""QUERY"": has Q? Q is uncommon? Maybe.

 But let's stick with ""REPLY"": 

   If the secret word has R in position 1, then we get R(✓). If not, then we'll get R(-) meaning it's elsewhere?
   Similarly, E in position 2: if correct, we get E(✓), else (-).

  This gives us information.

 But note: we know R is in the word and not in position 2. Now putting R in position 1 might be good because it's a new position? Similarly for E.

 So I think ""REPLY"" is a good guess.

 Another possibility: ""PUREE""? Duplicate E? Not good.

 Or ""WIDER"": letter W? but we might test a common letter? Actually, ""REPLY"" uses common letters: R, E, P, L, Y.

 Let me check if ""REPLY"" is a valid word: yes.

 So I choose ""REPLY"".

<guess>reply</guess>### Reasoning for Next Guess

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- **C**, **A**, **N** are **NOT** in the secret word (marked `x`).
- **R** and **E** are in the word but in the **WRONG positions** (marked `-`). Specifically:  
  - R cannot be in position 2.  
  - E cannot be in position 5.

#### Constraints for the next guess:
1. Must include:
   - **R** (anywhere except position 2).
   - **E** (anywhere except position 5).
2. Must **exclude** letters **C**, **A**, **N**.
3. Should prioritize new common letters to gather more information (e.g., S, T, L, I, O, P, Y).

#### Strategy:
- Place **R** in a new untested position (e.g., position 1, 3, or 4) to potentially identify its location.
- Place **E** in a new untested position (e.g., position 1, 2, 3, or 4) to narrow down its location.
- Test other frequent letters to maximize coverage of uneliminated alphabet.

#### Selected word: **REPLY**
- Breakdown:
  - **R** in position 1 (tests a new position for R, avoiding position 2).
  - **E** in position 2 (tests a new position for E, avoiding position 5).
  - **P**, **L**, **Y** are new high-frequency letters not yet tested.
- Validity:
  - Avoids forbidden letters (C, A, N).
  - Contains required letters (R and E).
  - Positions adhere to feedback constraints.

This guess efficiently leverages previous feedback to probe new positions and letters, helping isolate the secret word.

<guess>reply</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: reply -> FEEDBACK: R(-) E(-) P(x) L(x) Y(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two rounds of feedback:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: - (in word, wrong position)
  A: x (not in word)
  N: x (not in word)
  E: - (in word, wrong position)

Guess 2: ""reply""
  R: - (in word, wrong position) -> so R is in the word but not in position 1 (from reply) and not in position 2 (from crane)
  E: - (in word, wrong position) -> so E is in the word but not in position 2 (from reply) and not in position 5 (from crane)
  P: x (not in word)
  L: x (not in word)
  Y: x (not in word)

So now we know:
- The secret word contains R and E, and does not contain C, A, N, P, L, Y.
- R cannot be in positions 1 or 2.
- E cannot be in positions 2 or 5.

Since the word is 5 letters, R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

We also know that the word does not have: C, A, N, P, L, Y.

We need to think of a word that includes R and E (and no forbidden letters) and places R in one of {3,4,5} and E in one of {1,3,4}. Also, we want to test new common letters to get more information.

Common letters left: S, T, O, I, D, H, U, M, B, G, etc.

We should avoid repeating positions for R and E that we know are wrong? Actually, we are forced to put R in 3,4,5 and E in 1,3,4. But note: if we put R and E in the same position? That's not possible because they are different letters. Also, we don't know if they can be in the same position? But positions are for different letters.

We can try to put R and E in positions we haven't tried and also test other letters.

Let's list possible positions for R: 3,4,5
For E: 1,3,4

But note: if we put E in position 3 and R in position 3, that's impossible? No, because they are in the same position? But one position can only have one letter. So we cannot put both E and R in position 3 in the same guess? Actually, in a word, each position has one letter. So in our guess, we can only put one letter per position.

So we have to assign R to one of 3,4,5 and E to one of 1,3,4, but they cannot be in the same position. So if we assign E to 3, then R cannot be in 3? So R must be in 4 or 5. Similarly, if we assign R to 3, then E cannot be in 3? So E must be in 1 or 4.

We want to maximize information. So we should try to cover new positions and new letters.

Let me think of words that have R and E and avoid the forbidden letters.

Forbidden letters: C, A, N, P, L, Y.

Possible words: 
  We can try words like ""TIGER"", but let's check:
    T in pos1, I in pos2, G in pos3, E in pos4, R in pos5.
    This uses T, I, G, E, R.

  Check positions for E and R:
    E is in position 4 -> which is allowed (since E can be in 1,3,4 and 4 is allowed, and not 2 or 5)
    R is in position 5 -> which is allowed (R can be in 3,4,5, and 5 is allowed, and not 1 or 2)

  Also, we test T, I, G.

  But is ""TIGER"" a valid word? Yes.

  However, we don't know if the secret word has G or I? But that's the point: we are testing new letters.

Another possibility: ""TIMER"" -> but M is new? But ""TIMER"" has M? And E and R: E in pos4, R in pos5? Same as above? But we also test M? Actually, ""TIMER"" is T,I,M,E,R.

But we have two options. We can also consider ""RIVER"": but R in position 1? Not allowed? Because we know R is not in position 1? So we cannot put R in position 1? We must avoid position 1 for R? Because from ""reply"", R in position 1 got a ""-"", meaning it's in the word but not in position 1? So we must not put R in position 1 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient? Because we know it's not there? So we avoid.

Similarly, we avoid R in position 2 and E in position 2 and 5.

So ""TIGER"" has R in position 5 and E in position 4? That's good.

Another word: ""BORED"" -> B,O,R,E,D. 
  R in position 3? (B:1, O:2, R:3, E:4, D:5) 
  But E is in position 4? and R in position 3? 
  Also, we test B, O, D.

But we have to avoid forbidden letters? B,O,D are not forbidden? So that's okay.

But note: in ""BORED"", E is in position 4? and R in position 3? 
  We know E can be in 1,3,4? So 4 is okay? 
  R can be in 3,4,5? So 3 is okay.

But we also have to consider that we are testing O and B and D.

Another word: ""SERUM"" -> S,E,R,U,M. 
  But E is in position 2? We know E cannot be in position 2? Because from ""reply"", E in position 2 got a ""-"", meaning it's in the word but not in position 2? So we should avoid putting E in position 2? Because we already know it's not there? So we avoid.

Similarly, we avoid positions that we know are wrong for E and R.

So for E, avoid positions 2 and 5? So only 1,3,4? 
For R, avoid 1 and 2? So only 3,4,5.

So in ""SERUM"", E is in position 2? That's not allowed? So we skip.

How about ""RESIN""? But N is forbidden? So no.

""DRIVE"": D,R,I,V,E -> R in position 2? Avoid? R cannot be in position 2? So skip.

""OWLER""? But L is forbidden? Skip.

""QUEER""? Duplicate E? And Q? But also, E in position 3 and 5? But position 5 is forbidden for E? And we have duplicate? Not ideal? Also, Q is uncommon.

So let's stick with ""TIGER"" or ""BORED"".

But we have to choose one.

Another idea: ""TUNER""? But U and N? N is forbidden? Skip.

""RODEO""? But O and D? And A? No, ""RODEO"" has A? No, R,O,D,E,O? Duplicate O? And E in position 4? But R in position 1? Avoid R in position 1? So skip.

""GRIME""? G,R,I,M,E -> R in position 2? Avoid? Skip.

""BRIDE""? B,R,I,D,E -> R in position 2? Avoid? Skip.

""WROTE""? W,R,O,T,E -> R in position 2? Avoid? Skip.

""CRWTH""? Not a common word? And has C? Forbidden? Skip.

So back to ""TIGER"" and ""BORED"".

We can also consider ""HOMER""? H,O,M,E,R -> E in position 4, R in position 5? That's good? And we test H,O,M.

But ""HOMER"" is a valid word.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test as many new common letters as possible.

Common letters: S, T, O, I, D, H, M, etc.

In ""TIGER"": T, I, G, E, R -> tests T, I, G.
In ""BORED"": B, O, R, E, D -> tests B, O, D.
In ""HOMER"": H, O, M, E, R -> tests H, O, M.

We don't know which are more common? But in English, T, O, I, D are more common than G, B, H? 

But we have to consider that we have limited guesses. We have 3 more guesses? Actually, we have 4 left? We used 2, so 4 left? But we want to solve in as few as possible.

Another idea: ""TOWER""? But W? And E in position 5? Avoid? Skip.

""RIDER""? R in position 1? Avoid? And duplicate R? Skip.

""FRIED""? F,R,I,E,D -> R in position 2? Avoid? Skip.

So I think ""TIGER"" is a good choice.

But let me check if there is a word that uses S? Because S is very common.

How about ""TERMS""? T,E,R,M,S -> but E in position 2? Avoid? Skip.

""STERN""? S,T,E,R,N -> but N is forbidden? Skip.

""STEER""? Duplicate E? And E in position 5? Avoid? Skip.

""RESTY""? But Y is forbidden? Skip.

""RESET""? E in position 2? Avoid? And duplicate E? Skip.

So it's hard to include S without putting E in a bad position? Or using forbidden letters.

Another word: ""DETER""? D,E,T,E,R -> duplicate E? And E in position 2? Avoid? Skip.

""ENTER""? E in position 1? But N is forbidden? Skip.

""EMPTY""? E in position 1? Then M,P,T,Y? But P and Y are forbidden? Skip.

So perhaps ""TIGER"" is acceptable.

But we have to make sure that we don't put R and E in positions that conflict? In ""TIGER"", R is in 5 and E is in 4? That's fine.

We can also consider ""ROUGE""? But U and G? And E in position 5? Avoid? Skip.

""RANGE""? But A and N? Forbidden? Skip.

So I think ""TIGER"" is a good guess.

But let's see the positions: 
  Position 1: T
  Position 2: I
  Position 3: G
  Position 4: E
  Position 5: R

We know E must be in 1,3, or 4? Here we put E in 4? So if it's correct, we get E(✓). If not, then E must be in 1 or 3? Similarly, R in 5? If correct, R(✓), else R must be in 3 or 4? But note: if R is in 5, then we get R(✓). If not, then R is in 3 or 4? But we have E in 4? So if R is in 4, then E cannot be in 4? So we have to be careful? Actually, in the secret word, R and E are in different positions? So if we get feedback that E is not in 4, then we know E is in 1 or 3? And if R is not in 5, then R is in 3 or 4? But if R is in 4, then E cannot be in 4? So that's consistent.

But we are testing: we might get a ✓ for E or R? Or both? Or neither? But we'll get information.

Alternatively, we could try to put E in position 1? For example, ""EARTH""? But A is forbidden? Skip.

""EERIE""? Duplicate E? Skip.

""EXIST""? E in position 1? Then X,I,S,T? But X is uncommon? And we have to avoid S? No, S is allowed? But we don't know? We haven't tested S? But in ""EXIST"", E in position 1? That's allowed? But we test X? Not common.

""EDGES""? E in position 1? Then D,G,E,S? Duplicate E? Skip.

So it's hard to put E in position 1 without using forbidden letters or duplicates.

Similarly, for position 3: we could put E in position 3? For example, ""THREW""? T,H,R,E,W -> R in position 3? But we put R in position 3? Then E in position 4? Wait, ""THREW"": T1, H2, R3, E4, W5? So E in 4? Not 3? 

""ALERT""? A forbidden? Skip.

""BERTH""? B,E,R,T,H -> E in position 2? Avoid? Skip.

""MERIT""? M,E,R,I,T -> E in position 2? Avoid? Skip.

""PERIL""? P forbidden? Skip.

So I think ""TIGER"" is a reasonable choice.

Therefore, I'll go with ""TIGER"".

<guess>tiger</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback:
- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: 
  - C (x): Not in the word.
  - R (-): In the word, but not in position 2.
  - A (x): Not in the word.
  - N (x): Not in the word.
  - E (-): In the word, but not in position 5.

- **Guess 2 (REPLY)**:
  - R (-): In the word, but not in position 1 (confirms R is not in position 2 from Guess 1).
  - E (-): In the word, but not in position 2 (confirms E is not in position 5 from Guess 1).
  - P (x): Not in the word.
  - L (x): Not in the word.
  - Y (x): Not in the word.

### Key Constraints Derived:
1. **Confirmed letters in the secret word**: 
   - **R** and **E** must appear, but their positions are unknown.
2. **Eliminated letters**: 
   - C, A, N, P, L, Y are **not** in the word.
3. **Position constraints**:
   - **R**: Cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (must be in 3, 4, or 5).
   - **E**: Cannot be in positions 2 or 5 (must be in 1, 3, or 4).
4. **Other**: 
   - The word has no duplicates (based on standard Wordle rules and feedback).
   - Remaining letters to test: High-frequency consonants (e.g., S, T, D, M, B, G) and vowels (O, I, U).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Include R and E** in new positions to narrow down their locations:
  - R must be placed in position 3, 4, or 5.
  - E must be placed in position 1, 3, or 4 (but cannot share the same position as R).
- **Test new common letters**: Prioritize S, T, O, I, D, G, or M to maximize information.
- **Avoid eliminated letters**: C, A, N, P, L, Y.

### Why ""TIGER""?
- **T** (new), **I** (new), **G** (new), **E**, **R**.
- **Position testing**:
  - E is in position 4 (valid, as E cannot be in 2/5 and position 4 is untested).
  - R is in position 5 (valid, as R cannot be in 1/2 and position 5 is untested).
- **Letter coverage**: Tests three new common letters (T, I, G) while adhering to constraints.
- **Word validity**: ""TIGER"" is a valid 5-letter word.

This guess efficiently narrows possible positions for R and E while probing new letters. If E or R appear in their guessed positions (✓), it directly reveals their locations. If not (-/x), it further constrains possibilities for the next guess.

So E can be in 1,2,3, or 4.\n\n We don\'t have any correct position yet.\n\n Let\'s think of words that include R and E and avoid C,A,N.\n\n Some ideas: \n   words like ""ROUTE"", ""PRIDE"", ""BRUTE"", ""GRIEF"", but note:\n\n   - ""ROUTE"": contains T and U. Also, R is in position 1, E in position 5 -> but E cannot be in position 5? Wait, the feedback said E is in the word but not in position 5. So if we put E in position 5, that\'s invalid? Actually, no: the feedback only said it\'s not in position 5 in the secret word, so we shouldn\'t put E in position 5 in a guess? Not exactly. We can put E in position 5 again? But it would be wasteful because we know it\'s not there. So to test other positions, we should put E in a different position.\n\n We should avoid repeating the known incorrect positions for R (position 2) and E (position 5). So in our next guess, we can try R in positions 1,3,4 and E in positions 1,2,3,4.\n\n Also, we must avoid letters C, A, N.\n\n Let me try to think of a word that uses other common letters: perhaps S, T, L, I, O, etc.\n\n One word that comes to mind: ""STORE""\n   S: new letter\n   T: new letter\n   O: new letter\n   R: known to be in the word, we put it in position 4? \n   E: known to be in the word, we put it in position 5? -> but wait, we know E is not in position 5 in the secret word. However, in our guess putting E in position 5 is allowed? But if we do that and get E( - ) again, we\'ll know E is also not in position 5? We already know that! So it\'s redundant.\n\n Actually, we know E is not in position 5. So we shouldn\'t put E in position 5 because if we do, we\'ll get ""-"" again and learn nothing new about E? So better to try E in a new position.\n\n Similarly for R: avoid position 2.\n\n So avoid:\n   R in position 2\n   E in position 5\n\n Also, note: we don\'t know if there are duplicate letters? The rules don\'t say, so I assume no duplicates? Actually, Wordle can have duplicates? But typically we avoid unless we know? Actually, the rules say ""each letter"", so duplicates might be possible? But let\'s assume no duplicates until we have evidence? Or we can consider both? Since no feedback about duplicates, we\'ll assume the secret word has all unique letters? The example didn\'t have duplicates.\n\n I think we\'ll stick with unique letters.\n\n So let\'s try to use a word that has R and E in new positions and also tests three new letters.\n\n How about: ""PRIME""\n   P: new\n   R: in position 2 -> wait, we must avoid position 2 for R? Because in the secret word R is not in position 2? But in our guess, placing R in position 2 is allowed? However, if we put R in position 2, then the feedback would be ""-"" (since R is in the word but not in that position) and we already know that. So it\'s better to try R in a new position to see if we can get a ""✓"".\n\n Since R could be in other positions (1,3,4), we should try one of those.\n\n Similarly for E: cannot be in position 5? So avoid position 5 for E.\n\n So let\'s not put R in position 2 and not put E in position 5.\n\n Consider ""PRIME"":\n   P in pos1\n   R in pos2 -> we avoid R in pos2? We shouldn\'t be putting R in pos2 because we know it\'s not there? So no learning? But note: we might get feedback that R is not in pos2? But we already know that. So better to put R in a position we haven\'t tested.\n\n Let me think of words with R and E in new positions.\n\n How about ""RULER"": but has duplicate R? Avoid for now.\n\n How about ""ROUSE"": \n   R at pos1 -> good, not position 2\n   O at pos2\n   U at pos3\n   S at pos4\n   E at pos5 -> but we know E is not in position 5, so we can move E to a different position? \n\n Alternatively, ""RISEN"": but A and N are not allowed? We have N forbidden? ""RISEN"" has N -> not allowed.\n\n How about ""TRIBE""? \n   T at pos1\n   R at pos2? -> again, we must avoid R in pos2? \n\n How about ""ROGUE""? \n   R: pos1 -> good\n   O: pos2\n   G: pos3\n   U: pos4\n   E: pos5 -> but E in pos5? Not allowed? We are going to get that it\'s not there? So avoid.\n\n How about ""RADIO""? -> but A is forbidden? No, avoid.\n\n How about ""PARTY""? -> has A? not allowed.\n\n Another idea: ""REPLY""\n   R in pos1 -> new position (not pos2)\n   E in pos2 -> new for E (previously was in pos5, now pos2)\n   P, L, Y: new letters\n\n This seems good.\n\n But we must avoid forbidden letters: no C, A, N -> ""REPLY"" has R, E, P, L, Y -> none of these are forbidden? And we have R and E.\n\n So ""REPLY"" has:\n   R in position 1 (previously position 2) -> we\'ll see if it\'s correct?\n   E in position 2 (previously position 5) -> testing a new position for E.\n   Then P,L,Y are new.\n\n This is a valid word.\n\n Alternatively, ""POISE"" -> has E? But we put E in pos5? Not good.\n\n ""DRIVE"": D? D is new? R in position 2? avoid R in position 2 -> D in pos1, R in pos2 -> R in pos2 again? not efficient.\n\n ""INERT"": avoids forbidden? I,N,E,R,T? I and N: N is forbidden? So no.\n\n ""QUERY"": has Q? Q is uncommon? Maybe.\n\n But let\'s stick with ""REPLY"": \n\n   If the secret word has R in position 1, then we get R(✓). If not, then we\'ll get R(-) meaning it\'s elsewhere?\n   Similarly, E in position 2: if correct, we get E(✓), else (-).\n\n  This gives us information.\n\n But note: we know R is in the word and not in position 2. Now putting R in position 1 might be good because it\'s a new position? Similarly for E.\n\n So I think ""REPLY"" is a good guess.\n\n Another possibility: ""PUREE""? Duplicate E? Not good.\n\n Or ""WIDER"": letter W? but we might test a common letter? Actually, ""REPLY"" uses common letters: R, E, P, L, Y.\n\n Let me check if ""REPLY"" is a valid word: yes.\n\n So I choose ""REPLY"".\n\n<guess>reply</guess>### Reasoning for Next Guess\n\nBased on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- **C**, **A**, **N** are **NOT** in the secret word (marked `x`).\n- **R** and **E** are in the word but in the **WRONG positions** (marked `-`). Specifically:  \n  - R cannot be in position 2.  \n  - E cannot be in position 5.\n\n#### Constraints for the next guess:\n1. Must include:\n   - **R** (anywhere except position 2).\n   - **E** (anywhere except position 5).\n2. Must **exclude** letters **C**, **A**, **N**.\n3. Should prioritize new common letters to gather more information (e.g., S, T, L, I, O, P, Y).\n\n#### Strategy:\n- Place **R** in a new untested position (e.g., position 1, 3, or 4) to potentially identify its location.\n- Place **E** in a new untested position (e.g., position 1, 2, 3, or 4) to narrow down its location.\n- Test other frequent letters to maximize coverage of uneliminated alphabet.\n\n#### Selected word: **REPLY**\n- Breakdown:\n  - **R** in position 1 (tests a new position for R, avoiding position 2).\n  - **E** in position 2 (tests a new position for E, avoiding position 5).\n  - **P**, **L**, **Y** are new high-frequency letters not yet tested.\n- Validity:\n  - Avoids forbidden letters (C, A, N).\n  - Contains required letters (R and E).\n  - Positions adhere to feedback constraints.\n\nThis guess efficiently leverages previous feedback to probe new positions and letters, helping isolate the secret word.\n\n<guess>reply</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: reply -> FEEDBACK: R(-) E(-) P(x) L(x) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two rounds of feedback:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n  C: x (not in word)\n  R: - (in word, wrong position)\n  A: x (not in word)\n  N: x (not in word)\n  E: - (in word, wrong position)\n\nGuess 2: ""reply""\n  R: - (in word, wrong position) -> so R is in the word but not in position 1 (from reply) and not in position 2 (from crane)\n  E: - (in word, wrong position) -> so E is in the word but not in position 2 (from reply) and not in position 5 (from crane)\n  P: x (not in word)\n  L: x (not in word)\n  Y: x (not in word)\n\nSo now we know:\n- The secret word contains R and E, and does not contain C, A, N, P, L, Y.\n- R cannot be in positions 1 or 2.\n- E cannot be in positions 2 or 5.\n\nSince the word is 5 letters, R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.\nE must be in position 1, 3, or 4.\n\nWe also know that the word does not have: C, A, N, P, L, Y.\n\nWe need to think of a word that includes R and E (and no forbidden letters) and places R in one of {3,4,5} and E in one of {1,3,4}. Also, we want to test new common letters to get more information.\n\nCommon letters left: S, T, O, I, D, H, U, M, B, G, etc.\n\nWe should avoid repeating positions for R and E that we know are wrong? Actually, we are forced to put R in 3,4,5 and E in 1,3,4. But note: if we put R and E in the same position? That\'s not possible because they are different letters. Also, we don\'t know if they can be in the same position? But positions are for different letters.\n\nWe can try to put R and E in positions we haven\'t tried and also test other letters.\n\nLet\'s list possible positions for R: 3,4,5\nFor E: 1,3,4\n\nBut note: if we put E in position 3 and R in position 3, that\'s impossible? No, because they are in the same position? But one position can only have one letter. So we cannot put both E and R in position 3 in the same guess? Actually, in a word, each position has one letter. So in our guess, we can only put one letter per position.\n\nSo we have to assign R to one of 3,4,5 and E to one of 1,3,4, but they cannot be in the same position. So if we assign E to 3, then R cannot be in 3? So R must be in 4 or 5. Similarly, if we assign R to 3, then E cannot be in 3? So E must be in 1 or 4.\n\nWe want to maximize information. So we should try to cover new positions and new letters.\n\nLet me think of words that have R and E and avoid the forbidden letters.\n\nForbidden letters: C, A, N, P, L, Y.\n\nPossible words: \n  We can try words like ""TIGER"", but let\'s check:\n    T in pos1, I in pos2, G in pos3, E in pos4, R in pos5.\n    This uses T, I, G, E, R.\n\n  Check positions for E and R:\n    E is in position 4 -> which is allowed (since E can be in 1,3,4 and 4 is allowed, and not 2 or 5)\n    R is in position 5 -> which is allowed (R can be in 3,4,5, and 5 is allowed, and not 1 or 2)\n\n  Also, we test T, I, G.\n\n  But is ""TIGER"" a valid word? Yes.\n\n  However, we don\'t know if the secret word has G or I? But that\'s the point: we are testing new letters.\n\nAnother possibility: ""TIMER"" -> but M is new? But ""TIMER"" has M? And E and R: E in pos4, R in pos5? Same as above? But we also test M? Actually, ""TIMER"" is T,I,M,E,R.\n\nBut we have two options. We can also consider ""RIVER"": but R in position 1? Not allowed? Because we know R is not in position 1? So we cannot put R in position 1? We must avoid position 1 for R? Because from ""reply"", R in position 1 got a ""-"", meaning it\'s in the word but not in position 1? So we must not put R in position 1 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient? Because we know it\'s not there? So we avoid.\n\nSimilarly, we avoid R in position 2 and E in position 2 and 5.\n\nSo ""TIGER"" has R in position 5 and E in position 4? That\'s good.\n\nAnother word: ""BORED"" -> B,O,R,E,D. \n  R in position 3? (B:1, O:2, R:3, E:4, D:5) \n  But E is in position 4? and R in position 3? \n  Also, we test B, O, D.\n\nBut we have to avoid forbidden letters? B,O,D are not forbidden? So that\'s okay.\n\nBut note: in ""BORED"", E is in position 4? and R in position 3? \n  We know E can be in 1,3,4? So 4 is okay? \n  R can be in 3,4,5? So 3 is okay.\n\nBut we also have to consider that we are testing O and B and D.\n\nAnother word: ""SERUM"" -> S,E,R,U,M. \n  But E is in position 2? We know E cannot be in position 2? Because from ""reply"", E in position 2 got a ""-"", meaning it\'s in the word but not in position 2? So we should avoid putting E in position 2? Because we already know it\'s not there? So we avoid.\n\nSimilarly, we avoid positions that we know are wrong for E and R.\n\nSo for E, avoid positions 2 and 5? So only 1,3,4? \nFor R, avoid 1 and 2? So only 3,4,5.\n\nSo in ""SERUM"", E is in position 2? That\'s not allowed? So we skip.\n\nHow about ""RESIN""? But N is forbidden? So no.\n\n""DRIVE"": D,R,I,V,E -> R in position 2? Avoid? R cannot be in position 2? So skip.\n\n""OWLER""? But L is forbidden? Skip.\n\n""QUEER""? Duplicate E? And Q? But also, E in position 3 and 5? But position 5 is forbidden for E? And we have duplicate? Not ideal? Also, Q is uncommon.\n\nSo let\'s stick with ""TIGER"" or ""BORED"".\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nAnother idea: ""TUNER""? But U and N? N is forbidden? Skip.\n\n""RODEO""? But O and D? And A? No, ""RODEO"" has A? No, R,O,D,E,O? Duplicate O? And E in position 4? But R in position 1? Avoid R in position 1? So skip.\n\n""GRIME""? G,R,I,M,E -> R in position 2? Avoid? Skip.\n\n""BRIDE""? B,R,I,D,E -> R in position 2? Avoid? Skip.\n\n""WROTE""? W,R,O,T,E -> R in position 2? Avoid? Skip.\n\n""CRWTH""? Not a common word? And has C? Forbidden? Skip.\n\nSo back to ""TIGER"" and ""BORED"".\n\nWe can also consider ""HOMER""? H,O,M,E,R -> E in position 4, R in position 5? That\'s good? And we test H,O,M.\n\nBut ""HOMER"" is a valid word.\n\nNow, which one to choose? We want to test as many new common letters as possible.\n\nCommon letters: S, T, O, I, D, H, M, etc.\n\nIn ""TIGER"": T, I, G, E, R -> tests T, I, G.\nIn ""BORED"": B, O, R, E, D -> tests B, O, D.\nIn ""HOMER"": H, O, M, E, R -> tests H, O, M.\n\nWe don\'t know which are more common? But in English, T, O, I, D are more common than G, B, H? \n\nBut we have to consider that we have limited guesses. We have 3 more guesses? Actually, we have 4 left? We used 2, so 4 left? But we want to solve in as few as possible.\n\nAnother idea: ""TOWER""? But W? And E in position 5? Avoid? Skip.\n\n""RIDER""? R in position 1? Avoid? And duplicate R? Skip.\n\n""FRIED""? F,R,I,E,D -> R in position 2? Avoid? Skip.\n\nSo I think ""TIGER"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me check if there is a word that uses S? Because S is very common.\n\nHow about ""TERMS""? T,E,R,M,S -> but E in position 2? Avoid? Skip.\n\n""STERN""? S,T,E,R,N -> but N is forbidden? Skip.\n\n""STEER""? Duplicate E? And E in position 5? Avoid? Skip.\n\n""RESTY""? But Y is forbidden? Skip.\n\n""RESET""? E in position 2? Avoid? And duplicate E? Skip.\n\nSo it\'s hard to include S without putting E in a bad position? Or using forbidden letters.\n\nAnother word: ""DETER""? D,E,T,E,R -> duplicate E? And E in position 2? Avoid? Skip.\n\n""ENTER""? E in position 1? But N is forbidden? Skip.\n\n""EMPTY""? E in position 1? Then M,P,T,Y? But P and Y are forbidden? Skip.\n\nSo perhaps ""TIGER"" is acceptable.\n\nBut we have to make sure that we don\'t put R and E in positions that conflict? In ""TIGER"", R is in 5 and E is in 4? That\'s fine.\n\nWe can also consider ""ROUGE""? But U and G? And E in position 5? Avoid? Skip.\n\n""RANGE""? But A and N? Forbidden? Skip.\n\nSo I think ""TIGER"" is a good guess.\n\nBut let\'s see the positions: \n  Position 1: T\n  Position 2: I\n  Position 3: G\n  Position 4: E\n  Position 5: R\n\nWe know E must be in 1,3, or 4? Here we put E in 4? So if it\'s correct, we get E(✓). If not, then E must be in 1 or 3? Similarly, R in 5? If correct, R(✓), else R must be in 3 or 4? But note: if R is in 5, then we get R(✓). If not, then R is in 3 or 4? But we have E in 4? So if R is in 4, then E cannot be in 4? So we have to be careful? Actually, in the secret word, R and E are in different positions? So if we get feedback that E is not in 4, then we know E is in 1 or 3? And if R is not in 5, then R is in 3 or 4? But if R is in 4, then E cannot be in 4? So that\'s consistent.\n\nBut we are testing: we might get a ✓ for E or R? Or both? Or neither? But we\'ll get information.\n\nAlternatively, we could try to put E in position 1? For example, ""EARTH""? But A is forbidden? Skip.\n\n""EERIE""? Duplicate E? Skip.\n\n""EXIST""? E in position 1? Then X,I,S,T? But X is uncommon? And we have to avoid S? No, S is allowed? But we don\'t know? We haven\'t tested S? But in ""EXIST"", E in position 1? That\'s allowed? But we test X? Not common.\n\n""EDGES""? E in position 1? Then D,G,E,S? Duplicate E? Skip.\n\nSo it\'s hard to put E in position 1 without using forbidden letters or duplicates.\n\nSimilarly, for position 3: we could put E in position 3? For example, ""THREW""? T,H,R,E,W -> R in position 3? But we put R in position 3? Then E in position 4? Wait, ""THREW"": T1, H2, R3, E4, W5? So E in 4? Not 3? \n\n""ALERT""? A forbidden? Skip.\n\n""BERTH""? B,E,R,T,H -> E in position 2? Avoid? Skip.\n\n""MERIT""? M,E,R,I,T -> E in position 2? Avoid? Skip.\n\n""PERIL""? P forbidden? Skip.\n\nSo I think ""TIGER"" is a reasonable choice.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""TIGER"".\n\n<guess>tiger</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback\n\nFrom the feedback:\n- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: \n  - C (x): Not in the word.\n  - R (-): In the word, but not in position 2.\n  - A (x): Not in the word.\n  - N (x): Not in the word.\n  - E (-): In the word, but not in position 5.\n\n- **Guess 2 (REPLY)**:\n  - R (-): In the word, but not in position 1 (confirms R is not in position 2 from Guess 1).\n  - E (-): In the word, but not in position 2 (confirms E is not in position 5 from Guess 1).\n  - P (x): Not in the word.\n  - L (x): Not in the word.\n  - Y (x): Not in the word.\n\n### Key Constraints Derived:\n1. **Confirmed letters in the secret word**: \n   - **R** and **E** must appear, but their positions are unknown.\n2. **Eliminated letters**: \n   - C, A, N, P, L, Y are **not** in the word.\n3. **Position constraints**:\n   - **R**: Cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (must be in 3, 4, or 5).\n   - **E**: Cannot be in positions 2 or 5 (must be in 1, 3, or 4).\n4. **Other**: \n   - The word has no duplicates (based on standard Wordle rules and feedback).\n   - Remaining letters to test: High-frequency consonants (e.g., S, T, D, M, B, G) and vowels (O, I, U).\n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- **Include R and E** in new positions to narrow down their locations:\n  - R must be placed in position 3, 4, or 5.\n  - E must be placed in position 1, 3, or 4 (but cannot share the same position as R).\n- **Test new common letters**: Prioritize S, T, O, I, D, G, or M to maximize information.\n- **Avoid eliminated letters**: C, A, N, P, L, Y.\n\n### Why ""TIGER""?\n- **T** (new), **I** (new), **G** (new), **E**, **R**.\n- **Position testing**:\n  - E is in position 4 (valid, as E cannot be in 2/5 and position 4 is untested).\n  - R is in position 5 (valid, as R cannot be in 1/2 and position 5 is untested).\n- **Letter coverage**: Tests three new common letters (T, I, G) while adhering to constraints.\n- **Word validity**: ""TIGER"" is a valid 5-letter word.\n\nThis guess efficiently narrows possible positions for R and E while probing new letters.

We are given feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: crane
  C: x (not in word)
  R: - (in word, not in position 2)
  A: x (not in word)
  N: x (not in word)
  E: - (in word, not in position 5)

Guess 2: reply
  R: - (in word, not in position 1) -> combined with previous, R not in pos 1 or 2
  E: - (in word, not in position 2) -> combined with previous, E not in pos 2 or 5
  P: x (not in word)
  L: x (not in word)
  Y: x (not in word)

Guess 3: tiger
  T: x (not in word)
  I: ✓ (correct, in position 2)
  G: - (in word, not in position 3)
  E: ✓ (correct, in position 4)
  R: ✓ (correct, in position 5)

So from guess 3, we know:
- I is in position 2 and correct.
- E is in position 4 and correct.
- R is in position 5 and correct.
- G is in the word but not in position 3.
- T is not in the word.

Also, from previous guesses, we know the word does not contain: C, A, N, P, L, Y, T.

The secret word now has:
  Position 2: I
  Position 4: E
  Position 5: R

We also know that G is in the word but not in position 3, so G must be in position 1 or 3? Wait, position 3 is the only one left? Positions: 1,2,3,4,5. 2,4,5 are fixed. Only position 1 and 3 are missing? But we have two positions missing (1 and 3) and we know G must be in one of them? But also, we have the letter G and one more letter.

The word has to have 5 letters. We know positions:
  2: I
  4: E
  5: R
So positions 1 and 3 are unknown.

We know the word contains G (from feedback of tiger: G(-)), so since position 3 was guessed and G was not there (but in the word), G must be in the remaining positions? But we only have position 1 open? Or it could be in another position? But positions 2,4,5 are fixed? They are letters I, E, R? So G must be either in position 1 or position 3? But we guessed G in position 3 and got that it's not there (but present in the word), so G cannot be in position 3? Therefore, G must be in position 1.

Then position 3 is missing? But we have G in position 1? Then position 3 is the remaining letter? And it must be a letter that hasn't been eliminated?

Also, note: we have eliminated letters: C, A, N, P, L, Y, T. And forbidden based on feedback.

So we know the secret word has:
  Position 1: G? (must be, because G is in the word and not in position 3? and positions 2,4,5 are fixed, so only position 1 is left for G)

But wait, we only know that G is not in position 3? It could be in position 1? Yes. And we have position 3 as the last letter.

So the word is: [G or other?] at pos1, I at pos2, [?] at pos3, E at pos4, R at pos5.

But G must be in the word? Yes? And the only position left for G is position 1? Because position 3 was wrong? And positions 2,4,5 are taken by I, E, R? So yes.

Therefore, position 1 must be G? But we must confirm: couldn't G be in a position that conflicts? No, because we haven't fixed position 1 and 3, but position 3 we guessed G and it said wrong position? So that means G is in the word somewhere else? And since only position 1 is available? So yes.

Thus, the secret word must have:
  Position 1: G
  Position 2: I
  Position 3: ? 
  Position 4: E
  Position 5: R

But wait, feedback for guess 3: ""tiger"" -> 
  T: x -> T not in word.
  I: ✓ -> so position 2 is I? Correct? Yes.
  G: - -> G in word but not in position 3? Correct? Position 3 in tiger has G? But not there? So somewhere else? And we have position 1? So G must be in position 1? Because other positions are fixed? 2,4,5 have I,E,R? So yes.

Therefore, the word is: G, I, ?, E, R.

Now, we need to find the letter for position 3? But we also have to ensure that it is a letter not eliminated and valid.

Eliminated letters: C, A, N, P, L, Y, T.

Also, we know some letters that are not in the word? From above.

But we have feedback that G is in the word? So the letters in the word are: G, I, E, R, and one more for position 3.

What are the constraints for the missing letter? It must be a letter that hasn't been eliminated and not in the forbidden list.

We also have 4 more? No, we used 3 guesses? We can guess now.

But note: we have to find a word that matches: the first letter must be G, second I, fourth E, fifth R? And third letter? We don't know? But we must choose a valid word.

So the word is G I _ E R.

What words fit this pattern? For example: GIVER, GIBER, GIMER? Not common? WIDER? But W not eliminated? But we have eliminated letters? We have a list.

Eliminated: C, A, N, P, L, Y, T.

And we know the word has G, I, E, R.

So for G I _ E R, possible letters for position 3? Must be an English letter, and not eliminated.

Common possibilities: 
  D -> GIDER? Not a word? 
  B -> GIBER? Meaning? Gibber? Not exactly? Giber? It might be acceptable? 
  V -> GIVER: valid word? Yes.
  M -> GIMER? Not common?
  S -> GISER? Not a word?
  H -> GIHER? Not a word?
  K -> GIKER? Not a word?
  F -> GIFER? Not a word?
  O -> GIOER? Not a word?
  U -> GIUER? Not a word?

Common words: 
  GIVER: give + er? Like one who gives? Valid? Yes.
  GIBER: gibes? One who gibes? Also valid? But less common?

Also, perhaps ""GISER"" no? or ""GIYER""? Y is eliminated? Skip.

Another: ""GIPER""? P is eliminated? Skip.

So our only common choice is ""GIVER"" with V? Or ""GIBER"" with B? But B hasn't been tested? V hasn't been tested? 

But we also have to check if we have any feedback about B or V? No.

But note: we don't know if V or B is in the word? But we have to guess.

Also, could it be ""WISER""? But W is not and doesn't start with G? We need G in position 1.

So possible words: GIVER, GIBER.

But GIBER is not common? GIVER is more common.

Another word: ""FILER""? Doesn't start with G? 

""GIZER""? Not valid.

So let's check: V and B are not eliminated? So both are possible.

We also haven't used positions? For position 3? We have V or B? 

But in guess 3, we tested G in position 3? That was a '-' meaning G is present but not in position 3? Which we accounted for.

To confirm, we should be able to guess ""GIVER"" and see.

But we are allowed to guess the word? We have 3 tries left? 

Alternatively, we can consider: is there another word that fits? 

What about ""GOIER""? Not valid? ""GUSHER""? Doesn't fit.

So I think ""GIVER"" is the most likely.

But note: in guess 2, we tested ""REPLY"" and got R(-) E(-) etc? With E and R not in their guessed positions? And now we have them fixed? So ""GIVER"" has E in position 4? Which is correct? And R in position 5? Correct? And I in position 2? Correct? And G in position 1? As required? And V? 

We must ensure that V is not eliminated? It wasn't mentioned? So yes.

But in the feedback, have we tested V? We have tested: crane: C,R,A,N,E -> V not tested? Similarly, reply: R,E,P,L,Y? No V? tiger: T,I,G,E,R? No V? So V is possible.

Similarly for B? But ""GIBER"" might be acceptable? But ""GIVER"" is more standard.

Therefore, my guess is ""GIVER"".

But note: we might be able to solve? If we guess ""GIVER"" and it's correct? We win? Or get feedback? But since we have 3 tries? We can try.

Another possibility: what if the word is ""GUIDER""? But that's 6 letters? Or ""GOVER"" no? So 5 letters? Only ""GIVER""?

Also, ""GAMER""? A forbidden? Skip.

So I think ""GIVER"" is the best guess.

If not? Then we get feedback? But I believe based on the constraints.

So let's go with ""GIVER"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback  
The feedback from all three guesses provides critical constraints:  

1. **Confirmed correct letters and positions**:  
   - **I** is in position 2 (from Guess 3: `I(✓)`).  
   - **E** is in position 4 (from Guess 3: `E(✓)`).  
   - **R** is in position 5 (from Guess 3: `R(✓)`).  
   - **G** is in the word but not in position 3 (from Guess 3: `G(-)`).  

2. **Eliminated letters**:  
   - Not in the word: **C, A, N, P, L, Y, T** (marked `x` across guesses).  

3. **Position constraints for G**:  
   - Since position 2 (I), 4 (E), and 5 (R) are fixed, and G cannot be in position 3 (per Guess 3 feedback), G must be in position 1.  
   - Thus, the secret word starts with **G**, followed by **I** in position 2.  

4. **Remaining unknown**:  
   - Position 3 is the only missing letter, requiring a valid English letter not eliminated (not C, A, N, P, L, Y, T).  

### Deduced Word Structure  
The secret word must be: **G I ? E R**  
- Position 1: **G**  
- Position 2: **I**  
- Position 3: **?** (to be determined)  
- Position 4: **E**  
- Position 5: **R**  

### Valid Word Candidates  
The only common English word fitting this pattern is **GIVER** (meaning ""one who gives"").  
- **V** is not eliminated (not tested in prior guesses and not in the exclusion list).  
- Alternatives (e.g., GIBER) are less common or invalid.  

### Why ""GIVER""?  
- Adheres to all positional constraints (G at position 1, I at 2, E at 4, R at 5).  
- Tests the only plausible unknown letter (**V**) for position 3.  
- If correct, solves the puzzle. If incorrect, reveals **V**'s status.  

<guess>giver</guess>",giver,"We are given feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: crane
  C: x (not in word)
  R: - (in word, not in position 2)
  A: x (not in word)
  N: x (not in word)
  E: - (in word, not in position 5)

Guess 2: reply
  R: - (in word, not in position 1) -> combined with previous, R not in pos 1 or 2
  E: - (in word, not in position 2) -> combined with previous, E not in pos 2 or 5
  P: x (not in word)
  L: x (not in word)
  Y: x (not in word)

Guess 3: tiger
  T: x (not in word)
  I: ✓ (correct, in position 2)
  G: - (in word, not in position 3)
  E: ✓ (correct, in position 4)
  R: ✓ (correct, in position 5)

So from guess 3, we know:
- I is in position 2 and correct.
- E is in position 4 and correct.
- R is in position 5 and correct.
- G is in the word but not in position 3.
- T is not in the word.

Also, from previous guesses, we know the word does not contain: C, A, N, P, L, Y, T.

The secret word now has:
  Position 2: I
  Position 4: E
  Position 5: R

We also know that G is in the word but not in position 3, so G must be in position 1 or 3? Wait, position 3 is the only one left? Positions: 1,2,3,4,5. 2,4,5 are fixed. Only position 1 and 3 are missing? But we have two positions missing (1 and 3) and we know G must be in one of them? But also, we have the letter G and one more letter.

The word has to have 5 letters. We know positions:
  2: I
  4: E
  5: R
So positions 1 and 3 are unknown.

We know the word contains G (from feedback of tiger: G(-)), so since position 3 was guessed and G was not there (but in the word), G must be in the remaining positions? But we only have position 1 open? Or it could be in another position? But positions 2,4,5 are fixed? They are letters I, E, R? So G must be either in position 1 or position 3? But we guessed G in position 3 and got that it's not there (but present in the word), so G cannot be in position 3? Therefore, G must be in position 1.

Then position 3 is missing? But we have G in position 1? Then position 3 is the remaining letter? And it must be a letter that hasn't been eliminated?

Also, note: we have eliminated letters: C, A, N, P, L, Y, T. And forbidden based on feedback.

So we know the secret word has:
  Position 1: G? (must be, because G is in the word and not in position 3? and positions 2,4,5 are fixed, so only position 1 is left for G)

But wait, we only know that G is not in position 3? It could be in position 1? Yes. And we have position 3 as the last letter.

So the word is: [G or other?] at pos1, I at pos2, [?] at pos3, E at pos4, R at pos5.

But G must be in the word? Yes? And the only position left for G is position 1? Because position 3 was wrong? And positions 2,4,5 are taken by I, E, R? So yes.

Therefore, position 1 must be G? But we must confirm: couldn't G be in a position that conflicts? No, because we haven't fixed position 1 and 3, but position 3 we guessed G and it said wrong position? So that means G is in the word somewhere else? And since only position 1 is available? So yes.

Thus, the secret word must have:
  Position 1: G
  Position 2: I
  Position 3: ? 
  Position 4: E
  Position 5: R

But wait, feedback for guess 3: ""tiger"" -> 
  T: x -> T not in word.
  I: ✓ -> so position 2 is I? Correct? Yes.
  G: - -> G in word but not in position 3? Correct? Position 3 in tiger has G? But not there? So somewhere else? And we have position 1? So G must be in position 1? Because other positions are fixed? 2,4,5 have I,E,R? So yes.

Therefore, the word is: G, I, ?, E, R.

Now, we need to find the letter for position 3? But we also have to ensure that it is a letter not eliminated and valid.

Eliminated letters: C, A, N, P, L, Y, T.

Also, we know some letters that are not in the word? From above.

But we have feedback that G is in the word? So the letters in the word are: G, I, E, R, and one more for position 3.

What are the constraints for the missing letter? It must be a letter that hasn't been eliminated and not in the forbidden list.

We also have 4 more? No, we used 3 guesses? We can guess now.

  GIBER: gibes? One who gibes? Also valid? But less common?

Also, perhaps ""GISER"" no? or ""GIYER""? Y is eliminated? Skip.

So our only common choice is ""GIVER"" with V? Or ""GIBER"" with B? But B hasn't been tested? V hasn't been tested?

We must ensure that V is not eliminated? It wasn't mentioned? So yes.

But in the feedback, have we tested V? We have tested: crane: C,R,A,N,E -> V not tested? Similarly, reply: R,E,P,L,Y? No V? tiger: T,I,G,E,R? No V? So V is possible.
