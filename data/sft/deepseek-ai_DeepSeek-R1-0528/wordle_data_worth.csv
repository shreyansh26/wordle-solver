We are starting a new game. We have no prior feedback to work with.
 Since it's the first guess, we want to pick a word that maximizes the information we gain.
 A good starting word often contains common letters and has letters that are likely to appear in many words.
 Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N).

 One popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it contains three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).
 Another is ""SLATE"" which has two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (S, L, T).

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it covers a lot of common letters.

 If we get feedback on ""CRANE"", we can then narrow down the possibilities for the next guess.

 So I will go with ""CRANE"" for the first guess.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, from this we know:
 - The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since in ""crane"" it was at position 2 and got a '-' meaning wrong position).
 - The letters C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter R, and does not contain C, A, N, E.

 We have 5 remaining guesses.

 We need to make a second guess that is a 5-letter English word, and we want to maximize the information we get.

 Since we know R is in the word (but not at position 2), we should try to place R in a different position and also include other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

 We have eliminated the vowels A and E, so we are left with other vowels: I, O, U (and sometimes Y). But note that the word must have R and no C, A, N, E.

 Let's think of common letters that we haven't used: 
 We haven't used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We also know that R is in the word, so we can try to put R in a position other than 2.

 Since the word has 5 letters and R is one of them, we have 4 more letters to find.

 We should try to include other common consonants and vowels to get more information.

 Common consonants: S, T, L, D, M, etc.
 Common vowels: O, I.

 A good strategy is to try a word that has R in a different position and includes other common letters.

 Let's consider the positions: 
 Position 1: R could be here? But we don't know.
 Position 2: we know R is not here (because in the first guess R was at position 2 and it was wrong position, so it must be in one of 1,3,4,5).

 We can try to put R at position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Also, we want to avoid the letters that are already known to be absent: C, A, N, E.

 Let's think of words that have R and other common letters.

 Example: 
 - ""ROAST"" -> but A is absent, so we cannot use A.
 - ""ROBOT"" -> has O and B, T, but we don't know about O and B. However, we have to avoid A and E? Actually, we can use any letters except the ones we know are absent? But we know A and E are absent, so we must avoid them.

 We must avoid C, A, N, E.

 So, for the next guess, we can try a word that has R and also includes other common letters that we haven't tested, such as S, T, L, O, I, etc.

 Let's try to form a word without A, E, C, N.

 Some options:
 - ""SPORT"": has S, P, O, R, T -> R is at position 4. But we don't know if R is at 4. Also, we can test S, P, O, T.
 - ""FIRST"": has F, I, R, S, T -> R is at position 3. This tests F, I, S, T and R (which we know is present).
 - ""THIRD"": has T, H, I, R, D -> R at position 4.

 However, note that we have only one known letter (R) and we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Another idea: since R is the only known letter, we can try to use a word that has R and four new letters.

 Let's choose a word that has R in a position we haven't tested (so not position 2) and that uses common letters.

 Consider ""ROTIS"" but that might not be common. Instead, let's use ""STORM"": 
 - S, T, O, R, M -> R is at position 4. This tests S, T, O, M and we know R is present.

 But wait, we have to make sure the word is valid. ""STORM"" is a valid word.

 However, we have to avoid the absent letters: C, A, N, E. ""STORM"" does not contain any of these.

 Alternatively, ""SPORT"" is also valid.

 But note: we want to cover more vowels? We haven't tested O and I. ""STORM"" has O.

 Another candidate: ""BRISK"" -> but we don't know if B is present? And we haven't tested B. However, we are allowed to use B because it hasn't been ruled out.

 But we have to consider that we have limited guesses. We want to maximize information.

 Since we know R is in the word, we can try to put R at the beginning? Let's try a word with R at position 1.

 Example: ""ROBOT"" -> but has O and B, T. However, we must avoid A and E? Yes, and it does. But we also have to avoid C, A, N, E. ""ROBOT"" is okay.

 However, we have two O's? Actually, ""ROBOT"" has two O's? No: R-O-B-O-T -> two O's? Actually, it has one O at position 2 and one at position 4? Wait, no: positions: 1:R, 2:O, 3:B, 4:O, 5:T -> two O's. That might not be ideal because if the word has only one O, we might get confusing feedback.

 Alternatively, ""RUSTY"": R at position 1, and U, S, T, Y. This tests U, S, T, Y and R.

 But we don't know if the word has U, S, T, Y.

 Another idea: ""TRIPS"": T, R, I, P, S -> R at position 2? But wait, we know R is not at position 2? Because in the first guess R was at position 2 and it was wrong. So we should avoid putting R at position 2 again? Actually, we can put R at position 2 again? The feedback said it was in the word but wrong position. That doesn't mean it can't be at position 2 in a different word? No, because the secret word has R in some position, and we know it's not position 2 (because if it were, we would have gotten a check). So R must be in one of the other positions: 1,3,4,5.

 Therefore, we should avoid putting R at position 2 in the next guess? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we know it's not there. So we should try R in a new position.

 So let's avoid position 2 for R.

 We can try R at position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 I think a good candidate is ""SPORT"": 
 - S at 1, P at 2, O at 3, R at 4, T at 5.

 This way, we test S, P, O, T and R (which we know is present) and we put R at position 4.

 Another candidate: ""DRINK"" -> but D, R, I, N, K -> but N is absent! We cannot use N because we know it's not in the word. So ""DRINK"" is invalid because N is absent? Actually, no: the feedback for the first guess said N is absent, meaning the secret word does not contain N. So we must not use N in our next guess.

 Similarly, we cannot use C, A, E.

 Therefore, we must choose a word that does not contain C, A, N, E.

 Let's list some words without these letters and that have R in a position other than 2:

 - Position 1: R (e.g., ""ROTOS"" not a word, ""ROBOT"" has two O's and we don't know if O is present, but it's acceptable. However, we can use ""ROILS"": R, O, I, L, S -> but we don't know if O, I, L, S are present. And it avoids the forbidden letters.
 - Position 3: e.g., ""BIRDS"" -> B, I, R, D, S -> but S is common. However, we have to avoid A, E, C, N -> okay.
 - Position 4: e.g., ""SPORT"" as above.
 - Position 5: e.g., ""FUROR"" -> but has two R's? And two O's? Not ideal.

 After considering, I think ""SPORT"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and we haven't tested S, P, O, T.

 Alternatively, ""STRIP"": S, T, R, I, P -> but R is at position 3? And we avoid forbidden letters. However, we are testing S, T, R, I, P. But note: we are putting R at position 3, which is a new position.

 But wait, ""STRIP"" has R at position 3? Let's see: 
 S (1), T (2), R (3), I (4), P (5). That's okay.

 However, we are also testing S and T at the same time.

 Another candidate: ""ROOMY"" -> R at 1, but has two O's and we don't know if O is present. It might be less efficient.

 I think ""SPORT"" is a solid choice.

 But note: we are trying to get as much information as possible. We have 4 new letters: S, P, O, T. And we know R is present so we are also confirming the position of R (if we get a check for R at position 4, then we know it's there; if we get a dash, then R is in the word but not at 4, which we already know so it doesn't help? Actually, we know R is in the word, but we don't know the position. So if we put R at position 4 and get a dash, that means R is not at 4, so we can eliminate position 4. Similarly, if we get a check, we know R is at 4.

 So let's go with ""SPORT"".

 If we get feedback that R is at position 4 (check), then we know the fourth letter is R. If we get a dash, then R is not at 4, so it must be at 1, 3, or 5.

 Therefore, I choose ""SPORT"".

After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- ""R"" is in the secret word but not in the second position (indicated by ""-"").
- ""C"", ""A"", ""N"", and ""E"" are not in the secret word at all (indicated by ""x"").

For the second guess:
- The word must include ""R"" (since it's confirmed present) but avoid placing it in position 2 again.
- It should exclude ""C"", ""A"", ""N"", and ""E"" (known absent letters).
- To maximize information, I prioritized common unused letters (S, T, O, P) and placed ""R"" in a new position (position 4) to test its location.

The word ""SPORT"" fits these criteria:
- Contains ""R"" in position 4 (a new position to test).
- Introduces new common letters: S, T, O, P.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, A, N, E).

This guess will help narrow down the position of ""R"" and reveal which of the new letters (S, T, O, P) are present.

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,worth,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting a new game. We have no prior feedback to work with.
 Since it's the first guess, we want to pick a word that maximizes the information we gain.
 A good starting word often contains common letters and has letters that are likely to appear in many words.
 Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N).

 One popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it contains three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).
 Another is ""SLATE"" which has two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (S, L, T).

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it covers a lot of common letters.

 If we get feedback on ""CRANE"", we can then narrow down the possibilities for the next guess.

 So I will go with ""CRANE"" for the first guess.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, from this we know:
 - The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since in ""crane"" it was at position 2 and got a '-' meaning wrong position).
 - The letters C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter R, and does not contain C, A, N, E.

 We have 5 remaining guesses.

 We need to make a second guess that is a 5-letter English word, and we want to maximize the information we get.

 Since we know R is in the word (but not at position 2), we should try to place R in a different position and also include other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

 We have eliminated the vowels A and E, so we are left with other vowels: I, O, U (and sometimes Y). But note that the word must have R and no C, A, N, E.

 Let's think of common letters that we haven't used: 
 We haven't used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We also know that R is in the word, so we can try to put R in a position other than 2.

 Since the word has 5 letters and R is one of them, we have 4 more letters to find.

 We should try to include other common consonants and vowels to get more information.

 Common consonants: S, T, L, D, M, etc.
 Common vowels: O, I.

 A good strategy is to try a word that has R in a different position and includes other common letters.

 Let's consider the positions: 
 Position 1: R could be here? But we don't know.
 Position 2: we know R is not here (because in the first guess R was at position 2 and it was wrong position, so it must be in one of 1,3,4,5).

 We can try to put R at position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Also, we want to avoid the letters that are already known to be absent: C, A, N, E.

 Let's think of words that have R and other common letters.

 Example: 
 - ""ROAST"" -> but A is absent, so we cannot use A.
 - ""ROBOT"" -> has O and B, T, but we don't know about O and B. However, we have to avoid A and E? Actually, we can use any letters except the ones we know are absent? But we know A and E are absent, so we must avoid them.

 We must avoid C, A, N, E.

 So, for the next guess, we can try a word that has R and also includes other common letters that we haven't tested, such as S, T, L, O, I, etc.

 Let's try to form a word without A, E, C, N.

 Some options:
 - ""SPORT"": has S, P, O, R, T -> R is at position 4. But we don't know if R is at 4. Also, we can test S, P, O, T.
 - ""FIRST"": has F, I, R, S, T -> R is at position 3. This tests F, I, S, T and R (which we know is present).
 - ""THIRD"": has T, H, I, R, D -> R at position 4.

 However, note that we have only one known letter (R) and we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Another idea: since R is the only known letter, we can try to use a word that has R and four new letters.

 Let's choose a word that has R in a position we haven't tested (so not position 2) and that uses common letters.

 Consider ""ROTIS"" but that might not be common. Instead, let's use ""STORM"": 
 - S, T, O, R, M -> R is at position 4. This tests S, T, O, M and we know R is present.

 But wait, we have to make sure the word is valid. ""STORM"" is a valid word.

 However, we have to avoid the absent letters: C, A, N, E. ""STORM"" does not contain any of these.

 Alternatively, ""SPORT"" is also valid.

 But note: we want to cover more vowels? We haven't tested O and I. ""STORM"" has O.

 Another candidate: ""BRISK"" -> but we don't know if B is present? And we haven't tested B. However, we are allowed to use B because it hasn't been ruled out.

 But we have to consider that we have limited guesses. We want to maximize information.

 Since we know R is in the word, we can try to put R at the beginning? Let's try a word with R at position 1.

 Example: ""ROBOT"" -> but has O and B, T. However, we must avoid A and E? Yes, and it does. But we also have to avoid C, A, N, E. ""ROBOT"" is okay.

 However, we have two O's? Actually, ""ROBOT"" has two O's? No: R-O-B-O-T -> two O's? Actually, it has one O at position 2 and one at position 4? Wait, no: positions: 1:R, 2:O, 3:B, 4:O, 5:T -> two O's. That might not be ideal because if the word has only one O, we might get confusing feedback.

 Alternatively, ""RUSTY"": R at position 1, and U, S, T, Y. This tests U, S, T, Y and R.

 But we don't know if the word has U, S, T, Y.

 Another idea: ""TRIPS"": T, R, I, P, S -> R at position 2? But wait, we know R is not at position 2? Because in the first guess R was at position 2 and it was wrong. So we should avoid putting R at position 2 again? Actually, we can put R at position 2 again? The feedback said it was in the word but wrong position. That doesn't mean it can't be at position 2 in a different word? No, because the secret word has R in some position, and we know it's not position 2 (because if it were, we would have gotten a check). So R must be in one of the other positions: 1,3,4,5.

 Therefore, we should avoid putting R at position 2 in the next guess? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we know it's not there. So we should try R in a new position.

 So let's avoid position 2 for R.

 We can try R at position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 I think a good candidate is ""SPORT"": 
 - S at 1, P at 2, O at 3, R at 4, T at 5.

 This way, we test S, P, O, T and R (which we know is present) and we put R at position 4.

 Another candidate: ""DRINK"" -> but D, R, I, N, K -> but N is absent! We cannot use N because we know it's not in the word. So ""DRINK"" is invalid because N is absent? Actually, no: the feedback for the first guess said N is absent, meaning the secret word does not contain N. So we must not use N in our next guess.

 Similarly, we cannot use C, A, E.

 Therefore, we must choose a word that does not contain C, A, N, E.

 Let's list some words without these letters and that have R in a position other than 2:

 - Position 1: R (e.g., ""ROTOS"" not a word, ""ROBOT"" has two O's and we don't know if O is present, but it's acceptable. However, we can use ""ROILS"": R, O, I, L, S -> but we don't know if O, I, L, S are present. And it avoids the forbidden letters.
 - Position 3: e.g., ""BIRDS"" -> B, I, R, D, S -> but S is common. However, we have to avoid A, E, C, N -> okay.
 - Position 4: e.g., ""SPORT"" as above.
 - Position 5: e.g., ""FUROR"" -> but has two R's? And two O's? Not ideal.

 After considering, I think ""SPORT"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and we haven't tested S, P, O, T.

 Alternatively, ""STRIP"": S, T, R, I, P -> but R is at position 3? And we avoid forbidden letters. However, we are testing S, T, R, I, P. But note: we are putting R at position 3, which is a new position.

 But wait, ""STRIP"" has R at position 3? Let's see: 
 S (1), T (2), R (3), I (4), P (5). That's okay.

 However, we are also testing S and T at the same time.

 Another candidate: ""ROOMY"" -> R at 1, but has two O's and we don't know if O is present. It might be less efficient.

 I think ""SPORT"" is a solid choice.

 But note: we are trying to get as much information as possible. We have 4 new letters: S, P, O, T. And we know R is present so we are also confirming the position of R (if we get a check for R at position 4, then we know it's there; if we get a dash, then R is in the word but not at 4, which we already know so it doesn't help? Actually, we know R is in the word, but we don't know the position. So if we put R at position 4 and get a dash, that means R is not at 4, so we can eliminate position 4. Similarly, if we get a check, we know R is at 4.

 So let's go with ""SPORT"".

 If we get feedback that R is at position 4 (check), then we know the fourth letter is R. If we get a dash, then R is not at 4, so it must be at 1, 3, or 5.

 Therefore, I choose ""SPORT"".

<guess>sport</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- ""R"" is in the secret word but not in the second position (indicated by ""-"").
- ""C"", ""A"", ""N"", and ""E"" are not in the secret word at all (indicated by ""x"").

For the second guess:
- The word must include ""R"" (since it's confirmed present) but avoid placing it in position 2 again.
- It should exclude ""C"", ""A"", ""N"", and ""E"" (known absent letters).
- To maximize information, I prioritized common unused letters (S, T, O, P) and placed ""R"" in a new position (position 4) to test its location.

The word ""SPORT"" fits these criteria:
- Contains ""R"" in position 4 (a new position to test).
- Introduces new common letters: S, T, O, P.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, A, N, E).

This guess will help narrow down the position of ""R"" and reveal which of the new letters (S, T, O, P) are present.

We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
  Meaning:
    - R is in the word but not in position 2.
    - C, A, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""sport"" -> S(x) P(x) O(-) R(-) T(-)
  Meaning:
    - O is in the word but not in position 3.
    - R is in the word but not in position 4 (we already knew R was present and not in position 2, now we know also not in 4).
    - T is in the word but not in position 5.
    - S and P are not in the word.

So now we know:
  Present letters: R, O, T (and we know R is not in positions 2 or 4, O is not in position 3, T is not in position 5)
  Absent letters: C, A, N, E, S, P

We also know that the word must contain at least three letters from the set {R, O, T} (since we have three '-' in the feedback for ""sport"", meaning three letters are present but in wrong positions). However, note that R was already known to be present from the first guess, so the new present letters from ""sport"" are O and T. Therefore, the secret word contains at least R, O, T.

But wait, the feedback for ""sport"" shows three dashes: for O, R, and T. That means all three are present (but in wrong positions). So the secret word contains R, O, and T, and two other letters.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, O, T. So the absent letters are: C, A, N, E, S, P.

We need to choose a word that:
  - Contains R, O, T (since they are present) and two new letters that we haven't tested yet (and are not in the absent list).
  - The positions of R, O, T must not be in the positions we already know are wrong:
      R: not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 4 (from second guess) -> so R must be in position 1, 3, or 5.
      O: not in position 3 (from second guess) -> so O must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
      T: not in position 5 (from second guess) -> so T must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

We also must avoid the absent letters: C, A, N, E, S, P.

We have many letters left that we haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to maximize information by testing new common letters and also trying to place R, O, T in positions that are still possible.

Let's think of words that have R, O, T and two other new letters.

Common letters we haven't used: L, I, D, M, H, etc.

Possible words:

- ""ROTFL"" -> not a word.
- ""MOTOR"" -> has two O's? and we don't know if O is duplicated? Also, R is at the end? But we can try to avoid duplicates for now? Also, we have to avoid the absent letters.

But note: we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. However, to be safe, we can avoid duplicates for now.

Another idea: ""THROW"" -> but we have W, and H. However, we have to check the letters: T, H, R, O, W. 
  - T: present, but we are putting it at position 1 -> but we don't know if it's allowed at 1? The constraint is T not at 5, so 1 is okay.
  - H: not tested yet.
  - R: present, at position 3 -> which is a possible position (since R can be at 1,3,5). But we know R is not at 2 or 4, so 3 is okay.
  - O: present, at position 4 -> which is allowed (O can be at 1,2,4,5).
  - W: not tested.

But wait, the word ""THROW"" has T at position 1, H at 2, R at 3, O at 4, W at 5.

Constraints:
  - T at 1: allowed (since T cannot be at 5, but 1 is fine).
  - R at 3: allowed (since R cannot be at 2 or 4, but 3 is fine).
  - O at 4: allowed (since O cannot be at 3, but 4 is fine).

But we have to check if we are violating any known feedback? We are not, because we are placing them in positions that are not forbidden.

However, note that we are testing T at position 1: if we get a dash, that means T is in the word but not at 1 (which we already know it is present, so that would tell us T is not at 1). Similarly for R and O.

But also, we are introducing H and W.

But wait, the word ""THROW"" is a valid word.

Another candidate: ""BROTH"" -> B, R, O, T, H. 
  Positions: B(1), R(2), O(3), T(4), H(5)
  But R is at position 2 -> but we know R cannot be at position 2 (from first guess). So we cannot put R at 2.

So ""BROTH"" is invalid because of R at 2.

Another candidate: ""FORTY"" -> F, O, R, T, Y.
  Positions: F(1), O(2), R(3), T(4), Y(5)
  Check constraints:
    R at 3: allowed (not 2 or 4? 3 is not 2 or 4 -> allowed).
    O at 2: allowed (O can be at 2, since we only know it's not at 3).
    T at 4: allowed (T can be at 4, since we only know it's not at 5).

But note: we are putting T at 4, which is allowed, but if we get a dash for T, that means T is not at 4, which would be new information.

Similarly, O at 2: if we get a dash, then O is not at 2.

So ""FORTY"" is a valid word and tests F and Y.

But we have to avoid absent letters: F and Y are not in the absent list, so okay.

Another candidate: ""DOUBT"" -> but has D, O, U, B, T. But we don't have R? We must include R because we know it's in the word. So we cannot skip R.

So we must have R, O, T.

Let me list words that contain R, O, T and two other letters from the available set.

We can try ""TROIK"" -> not a word.

""TROMP"" -> but P is absent? We know P is absent from the second guess. So we cannot use P.

We must avoid C, A, N, E, S, P.

So ""FORTY"" and ""THROW"" are candidates.

But let's check ""THROW"" again: 
  T at 1: if the secret word has T at 1, we get a check. If not, we get a dash and know T is not at 1.
  H at 2: if present, we get a dash (since if it were in the correct position we'd get a check, but we don't know the position) or if absent we get x. But we are testing H.
  R at 3: same logic.
  O at 4: same.
  W at 5: same.

But note: we know T is present, so if we get a dash for T at 1, that means T is not at 1, so it must be at 2,3, or 4 (but not 5). Similarly, if we get a dash for R at 3, then R is not at 3 (so must be at 1 or 5). And for O at 4, if dash then not at 4 (so at 1,2,5).

Alternatively, ""FORTY"": 
  F at 1: test F.
  O at 2: test O at 2.
  R at 3: test R at 3.
  T at 4: test T at 4.
  Y at 5: test Y.

But we know T is present, and we are putting it at 4. If we get a dash for T, then T is not at 4, so it must be at 1,2,3 (but we are also testing T at 4, so if we get a dash, we know T is in the word but not at 4). Similarly for the others.

I think both are good. But let's see which one covers more common letters.

Common letters: H is more common than F and Y? Actually, H is quite common. Also, W is common. In ""THROW"" we test H and W. In ""FORTY"" we test F and Y. H is more common than F and Y? According to letter frequency, H is more common than F and Y.

But we also have to consider the positions. We have constraints on R, O, T.

Another candidate: ""MORTY"" -> not a word? ""MORAY"" is a word but has A which is absent. 

""TORCH"" -> but C is absent.

""ROWDY"" -> R, O, W, D, Y. 
  Positions: R(1), O(2), W(3), D(4), Y(5)
  Constraints:
    R at 1: allowed (R can be at 1,3,5 -> 1 is allowed).
    O at 2: allowed (O can be at 1,2,4,5 -> 2 is allowed).
    But we are not including T? We must include T because we know it's present. So we cannot skip T.

We must have T.

Another candidate: ""TROLL"" -> T, R, O, L, L -> duplicate L? and we are putting T at 1, R at 2 -> but R at 2 is forbidden! We know R cannot be at 2. So invalid.

""TROUT"" -> T, R, O, U, T -> duplicate T? and we are putting T at 1 and 5? But we know T is present, but we don't know if it appears twice. Also, R at 3: allowed. O at 4: allowed. But we have two T's? And we are putting T at 1 and 5. We know T is not at 5 (from the feedback of ""sport"": T at 5 was wrong, but that doesn't mean T cannot be at 5? Actually, the feedback for T in ""sport"" was at position 5 and it was a dash, meaning T is in the word but not at 5. So if we put T at 5 again, we know it will be a dash again. But we are also putting T at 1. So if the word has two T's, then we might get a check for T at 1 and a dash for T at 5? But we don't know if there are two T's.

But to avoid complexity, let's avoid duplicates for now.

So back to ""THROW"" and ""FORTY"". 

I think ""THROW"" is a better choice because it tests H and W, which are common, and places the known letters in positions that are allowed and might give us more positional information.

But note: in ""THROW"", we are putting R at position 3. We know R is not at 2 or 4, so 3 is a candidate. Similarly, O at 4 is allowed (since we only know it's not at 3). T at 1 is allowed (since we know it's not at 5).

So I choose ""THROW"".

But wait, what about the possibility that the word has duplicate letters? We are not testing that, but we can handle that later.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a vowel we haven't tested? We haven't tested I, U. But we have O already, which is a vowel.

But ""THROW"" doesn't have I or U.

Another candidate: ""FRUIT"" -> but F, R, U, I, T -> but we have R and T, and we are testing F, U, I. However, we are missing O? We know O is present, so we must include O. So we cannot skip O.

We must include all three: R, O, T.

So ""FRUIT"" doesn't have O.

""ROTUND"" -> too long.

""QUORT"" -> not a word.

I think ""THROW"" is a good choice.

So I'll go with ""THROW"".

But let me confirm the letters: T, H, R, O, W. 
  - T: present, at position 1 (allowed because T cannot be at 5, but 1 is okay)
  - H: new
  - R: present, at position 3 (allowed because R cannot be at 2 or 4, and 3 is not 2 or 4)
  - O: present, at position 4 (allowed because O cannot be at 3, and 4 is not 3)
  - W: new

And we avoid C, A, N, E, S, P.

So <guess>throw</guess>

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
  Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - R is in the secret word but **not in position 2**.  
  - C, A, N, E are **not in the word**.  

- **Guess 2: ""sport""**  
  Feedback: S(x), P(x), O(-), R(-), T(-)  
  Interpretation:  
  - O is in the word but **not in position 3**.  
  - R is in the word but **not in position 4** (consistent with prior knowledge).  
  - T is in the word but **not in position 5**.  
  - S and P are **not in the word**.  

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed Letters**:  
   - **R, O, T** are in the secret word.  
   - **Absent Letters**: C, A, N, E, S, P (cannot be used).  

2. **Position Constraints**:  
   - **R**: Cannot be in positions 2 or 4 → must be in **1, 3, or 5**.  
   - **O**: Cannot be in position 3 → must be in **1, 2, 4, or 5**.  
   - **T**: Cannot be in position 5 → must be in **1, 2, 3, or 4**.  

3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:  
   - Must include **R, O, T** (since all are confirmed present).  
   - Must avoid absent letters (C, A, N, E, S, P).  
   - Test **new common letters** (e.g., H, W) to maximize information.  
   - Place R, O, T in **new positions** to narrow down their locations:  
     - R in position 3 (allowed, and not tested before).  
     - O in position 4 (allowed, and not tested before).  
     - T in position 1 (allowed, and not tested before).  

### Why ""THROW""?
- **Fits all constraints**:  
  - Contains R (position 3), O (position 4), T (position 1).  
  - Avoids absent letters (C, A, N, E, S, P).  
  - Tests **H** (position 2) and **W** (position 5), which are common letters not yet tried.  
- **Maximizes information**:  
  - Tests T at position 1 (if ✔, T is confirmed at 1; if ✗, T is not at 1).  
  - Tests R at position 3 (if ✔, R is confirmed at 3; if ✗, R is not at 3).  
  - Tests O at position 4 (if ✔, O is confirmed at 4; if ✗, O is not at 4).  
  - Tests H and W for presence/absence.  

<guess>throw</guess>",throw,"We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
  Meaning:
    - R is in the word but not in position 2.
    - C, A, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""sport"" -> S(x) P(x) O(-) R(-) T(-)
  Meaning:
    - O is in the word but not in position 3.
    - R is in the word but not in position 4 (we already knew R was present and not in position 2, now we know also not in 4).
    - T is in the word but not in position 5.
    - S and P are not in the word.

So now we know:
  Present letters: R, O, T (and we know R is not in positions 2 or 4, O is not in position 3, T is not in position 5)
  Absent letters: C, A, N, E, S, P

We also know that the word must contain at least three letters from the set {R, O, T} (since we have three '-' in the feedback for ""sport"", meaning three letters are present but in wrong positions). However, note that R was already known to be present from the first guess, so the new present letters from ""sport"" are O and T. Therefore, the secret word contains at least R, O, T.

But wait, the feedback for ""sport"" shows three dashes: for O, R, and T. That means all three are present (but in wrong positions). So the secret word contains R, O, and T, and two other letters.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, O, T. So the absent letters are: C, A, N, E, S, P.

We need to choose a word that:
  - Contains R, O, T (since they are present) and two new letters that we haven't tested yet (and are not in the absent list).
  - The positions of R, O, T must not be in the positions we already know are wrong:
      R: not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 4 (from second guess) -> so R must be in position 1, 3, or 5.
      O: not in position 3 (from second guess) -> so O must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
      T: not in position 5 (from second guess) -> so T must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

We also must avoid the absent letters: C, A, N, E, S, P.

We have many letters left that we haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to maximize information by testing new common letters and also trying to place R, O, T in positions that are still possible.

Let's think of words that have R, O, T and two other new letters.

Common letters we haven't used: L, I, D, M, H, etc.

Possible words:

- ""ROTFL"" -> not a word.
- ""MOTOR"" -> has two O's? and we don't know if O is duplicated? Also, R is at the end? But we can try to avoid duplicates for now? Also, we have to avoid the absent letters.

But note: we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. However, to be safe, we can avoid duplicates for now.

Another idea: ""THROW"" -> but we have W, and H. However, we have to check the letters: T, H, R, O, W. 
  - T: present, but we are putting it at position 1 -> but we don't know if it's allowed at 1? The constraint is T not at 5, so 1 is okay.
  - H: not tested yet.
  - R: present, at position 3 -> which is a possible position (since R can be at 1,3,5). But we know R is not at 2 or 4, so 3 is okay.
  - O: present, at position 4 -> which is allowed (O can be at 1,2,4,5).
  - W: not tested.

But wait, the word ""THROW"" has T at position 1, H at 2, R at 3, O at 4, W at 5.

Constraints:
  - T at 1: allowed (since T cannot be at 5, but 1 is fine).
  - R at 3: allowed (since R cannot be at 2 or 4, but 3 is fine).
  - O at 4: allowed (since O cannot be at 3, but 4 is fine).

But we have to check if we are violating any known feedback? We are not, because we are placing them in positions that are not forbidden.

However, note that we are testing T at position 1: if we get a dash, that means T is in the word but not at 1 (which we already know it is present, so that would tell us T is not at 1). Similarly for R and O.

But also, we are introducing H and W.

But wait, the word ""THROW"" is a valid word.

Another candidate: ""BROTH"" -> B, R, O, T, H. 
  Positions: B(1), R(2), O(3), T(4), H(5)
  But R is at position 2 -> but we know R cannot be at position 2 (from first guess). So we cannot put R at 2.

So ""BROTH"" is invalid because of R at 2.

Another candidate: ""FORTY"" -> F, O, R, T, Y.
  Positions: F(1), O(2), R(3), T(4), Y(5)
  Check constraints:
    R at 3: allowed (not 2 or 4? 3 is not 2 or 4 -> allowed).
    O at 2: allowed (O can be at 2, since we only know it's not at 3).
    T at 4: allowed (T can be at 4, since we only know it's not at 5).

But note: we are putting T at 4, which is allowed, but if we get a dash for T, that means T is not at 4, which would be new information.

Similarly, O at 2: if we get a dash, then O is not at 2.

So ""FORTY"" is a valid word and tests F and Y.

But we have to avoid absent letters: F and Y are not in the absent list, so okay.

Another candidate: ""DOUBT"" -> but has D, O, U, B, T. But we don't have R? We must include R because we know it's in the word. So we cannot skip R.

So we must have R, O, T.

Let me list words that contain R, O, T and two other letters from the available set.

We can try ""TROIK"" -> not a word.

""TROMP"" -> but P is absent? We know P is absent from the second guess. So we cannot use P.

We must avoid C, A, N, E, S, P.

So ""FORTY"" and ""THROW"" are candidates.

But let's check ""THROW"" again: 
  T at 1: if the secret word has T at 1, we get a check. If not, we get a dash and know T is not at 1.
  H at 2: if present, we get a dash (since if it were in the correct position we'd get a check, but we don't know the position) or if absent we get x. But we are testing H.
  R at 3: same logic.
  O at 4: same.
  W at 5: same.

But note: we know T is present, so if we get a dash for T at 1, that means T is not at 1, so it must be at 2,3, or 4 (but not 5). Similarly, if we get a dash for R at 3, then R is not at 3 (so must be at 1 or 5). And for O at 4, if dash then not at 4 (so at 1,2,5).

Alternatively, ""FORTY"": 
  F at 1: test F.
  O at 2: test O at 2.
  R at 3: test R at 3.
  T at 4: test T at 4.
  Y at 5: test Y.

But we know T is present, and we are putting it at 4. If we get a dash for T, then T is not at 4, so it must be at 1,2,3 (but we are also testing T at 4, so if we get a dash, we know T is in the word but not at 4). Similarly for the others.

  Positions: R(1), O(2), W(3), D(4), Y(5)
  Constraints:
    R at 1: allowed (R can be at 1,3,5 -> 1 is allowed).
    O at 2: allowed (O can be at 1,2,4,5 -> 2 is allowed).
    But we are not including T? We must include T because we know it's present. So we cannot skip T.

We must have T.

Another candidate: ""TROLL"" -> T, R, O, L, L -> duplicate L? and we are putting T at 1, R at 2 -> but R at 2 is forbidden! We know R cannot be at 2. So invalid.

""TROUT"" -> T, R, O, U, T -> duplicate T? and we are putting T at 1 and 5? But we know T is present, but we don't know if it appears twice. Also, R at 3: allowed. O at 4: allowed.

We must include all three: R, O, T.

So ""FRUIT"" doesn't have O.

""ROTUND"" -> too long.

""QUORT"" -> not a word.

I think ""THROW"" is a good choice.

So I'll go with ""THROW"".

But let me confirm the letters: T, H, R, O, W.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting a new game. We have no prior feedback to work with.
 Since it's the first guess, we want to pick a word that maximizes the information we gain.
 A good starting word often contains common letters and has letters that are likely to appear in many words.
 Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N).

 One popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it contains three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).
 Another is ""SLATE"" which has two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (S, L, T).

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it covers a lot of common letters.

 If we get feedback on ""CRANE"", we can then narrow down the possibilities for the next guess.

 So I will go with ""CRANE"" for the first guess.

 - The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since in ""crane"" it was at position 2 and got a '-' meaning wrong position).
 - The letters C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter R, and does not contain C, A, N, E.

 We have 5 remaining guesses.

 We need to make a second guess that is a 5-letter English word, and we want to maximize the information we get.

 Since we know R is in the word (but not at position 2), we should try to place R in a different position and also include other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

 We have eliminated the vowels A and E, so we are left with other vowels: I, O, U (and sometimes Y). But note that the word must have R and no C, A, N, E.

 Let's think of common letters that we haven't used: 
 We haven't used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We also know that R is in the word, so we can try to put R in a position other than 2.

 Since the word has 5 letters and R is one of them, we have 4 more letters to find.

 We should try to include other common consonants and vowels to get more information.

 Common consonants: S, T, L, D, M, etc.
 Common vowels: O, I.

 A good strategy is to try a word that has R in a different position and includes other common letters.

 Let's consider the positions: 
 Position 1: R could be here? But we don't know.
 Position 2: we know R is not here (because in the first guess R was at position 2 and it was wrong position, so it must be in one of 1,3,4,5).

 We can try to put R at position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Also, we want to avoid the letters that are already known to be absent: C, A, N, E.

 Let's think of words that have R and other common letters.

 Example: 
 - ""ROAST"" -> but A is absent, so we cannot use A.
 - ""ROBOT"" -> has O and B, T, but we don't know about O and B. However, we have to avoid A and E? Actually, we can use any letters except the ones we know are absent? But we know A and E are absent, so we must avoid them.

 We must avoid C, A, N, E.

 So, for the next guess, we can try a word that has R and also includes other common letters that we haven't tested, such as S, T, L, O, I, etc.

 Let's try to form a word without A, E, C, N.

 Some options:
 - ""SPORT"": has S, P, O, R, T -> R is at position 4. But we don't know if R is at 4. Also, we can test S, P, O, T.
 - ""FIRST"": has F, I, R, S, T -> R is at position 3. This tests F, I, S, T and R (which we know is present).
 - ""THIRD"": has T, H, I, R, D -> R at position 4.

 However, note that we have only one known letter (R) and we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Another idea: since R is the only known letter, we can try to use a word that has R and four new letters.

 Let's choose a word that has R in a position we haven't tested (so not position 2) and that uses common letters.

 Consider ""ROTIS"" but that might not be common. Instead, let's use ""STORM"": 
 - S, T, O, R, M -> R is at position 4. This tests S, T, O, M and we know R is present.

 But wait, we have to make sure the word is valid. ""STORM"" is a valid word.

 However, we have to avoid the absent letters: C, A, N, E. ""STORM"" does not contain any of these.

 Alternatively, ""SPORT"" is also valid.

 But note: we want to cover more vowels? We haven't tested O and I. ""STORM"" has O.

 Another candidate: ""BRISK"" -> but we don't know if B is present? And we haven't tested B. However, we are allowed to use B because it hasn't been ruled out.

 But we have to consider that we have limited guesses. We want to maximize information.

 Since we know R is in the word, we can try to put R at the beginning? Let's try a word with R at position 1.

 Example: ""ROBOT"" -> but has O and B, T. However, we must avoid A and E? Yes, and it does. But we also have to avoid C, A, N, E. ""ROBOT"" is okay.

 However, we have two O's? Actually, ""ROBOT"" has two O's? No: R-O-B-O-T -> two O's? Actually, it has one O at position 2 and one at position 4? Wait, no: positions: 1:R, 2:O, 3:B, 4:O, 5:T -> two O's. That might not be ideal because if the word has only one O, we might get confusing feedback.

 Alternatively, ""RUSTY"": R at position 1, and U, S, T, Y. This tests U, S, T, Y and R.

 But we don't know if the word has U, S, T, Y.

 Another idea: ""TRIPS"": T, R, I, P, S -> R at position 2? But wait, we know R is not at position 2? Because in the first guess R was at position 2 and it was wrong. So we should avoid putting R at position 2 again? Actually, we can put R at position 2 again? The feedback said it was in the word but wrong position. That doesn't mean it can't be at position 2 in a different word? No, because the secret word has R in some position, and we know it's not position 2 (because if it were, we would have gotten a check). So R must be in one of the other positions: 1,3,4,5.

 Therefore, we should avoid putting R at position 2 in the next guess? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we know it's not there. So we should try R in a new position.

 So let's avoid position 2 for R.

 We can try R at position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 I think a good candidate is ""SPORT"": 
 - S at 1, P at 2, O at 3, R at 4, T at 5.

 This way, we test S, P, O, T and R (which we know is present) and we put R at position 4.

 Another candidate: ""DRINK"" -> but D, R, I, N, K -> but N is absent! We cannot use N because we know it's not in the word. So ""DRINK"" is invalid because N is absent? Actually, no: the feedback for the first guess said N is absent, meaning the secret word does not contain N. So we must not use N in our next guess.

 Similarly, we cannot use C, A, E.

 Therefore, we must choose a word that does not contain C, A, N, E.

 Let's list some words without these letters and that have R in a position other than 2:

 - Position 1: R (e.g., ""ROTOS"" not a word, ""ROBOT"" has two O's and we don't know if O is present, but it's acceptable. However, we can use ""ROILS"": R, O, I, L, S -> but we don't know if O, I, L, S are present. And it avoids the forbidden letters.
 - Position 3: e.g., ""BIRDS"" -> B, I, R, D, S -> but S is common. However, we have to avoid A, E, C, N -> okay.
 - Position 4: e.g., ""SPORT"" as above.
 - Position 5: e.g., ""FUROR"" -> but has two R's? And two O's? Not ideal.

 After considering, I think ""SPORT"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and we haven't tested S, P, O, T.

 Alternatively, ""STRIP"": S, T, R, I, P -> but R is at position 3? And we avoid forbidden letters. However, we are testing S, T, R, I, P. But note: we are putting R at position 3, which is a new position.

 But wait, ""STRIP"" has R at position 3? Let's see: 
 S (1), T (2), R (3), I (4), P (5). That's okay.

 However, we are also testing S and T at the same time.

 Another candidate: ""ROOMY"" -> R at 1, but has two O's and we don't know if O is present. It might be less efficient.

 I think ""SPORT"" is a solid choice.

 But note: we are trying to get as much information as possible. We have 4 new letters: S, P, O, T. And we know R is present so we are also confirming the position of R (if we get a check for R at position 4, then we know it's there; if we get a dash, then R is in the word but not at 4, which we already know so it doesn't help? Actually, we know R is in the word, but we don't know the position. So if we put R at position 4 and get a dash, that means R is not at 4, so we can eliminate position 4. Similarly, if we get a check, we know R is at 4.

 So let's go with ""SPORT"".

 If we get feedback that R is at position 4 (check), then we know the fourth letter is R. If we get a dash, then R is not at 4, so it must be at 1, 3, or 5.

 Therefore, I choose ""SPORT"".

<guess>sport</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- ""R"" is in the secret word but not in the second position (indicated by ""-"").
- ""C"", ""A"", ""N"", and ""E"" are not in the secret word at all (indicated by ""x"").

For the second guess:
- The word must include ""R"" (since it's confirmed present) but avoid placing it in position 2 again.
- It should exclude ""C"", ""A"", ""N"", and ""E"" (known absent letters).
- To maximize information, I prioritized common unused letters (S, T, O, P) and placed ""R"" in a new position (position 4) to test its location.

The word ""SPORT"" fits these criteria:
- Contains ""R"" in position 4 (a new position to test).
- Introduces new common letters: S, T, O, P.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, A, N, E).

This guess will help narrow down the position of ""R"" and reveal which of the new letters (S, T, O, P) are present.

<guess>sport</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: sport -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(-) R(-) T(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
  Meaning:
    - R is in the word but not in position 2.
    - C, A, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""sport"" -> S(x) P(x) O(-) R(-) T(-)
  Meaning:
    - O is in the word but not in position 3.
    - R is in the word but not in position 4 (we already knew R was present and not in position 2, now we know also not in 4).
    - T is in the word but not in position 5.
    - S and P are not in the word.

So now we know:
  Present letters: R, O, T (and we know R is not in positions 2 or 4, O is not in position 3, T is not in position 5)
  Absent letters: C, A, N, E, S, P

We also know that the word must contain at least three letters from the set {R, O, T} (since we have three '-' in the feedback for ""sport"", meaning three letters are present but in wrong positions). However, note that R was already known to be present from the first guess, so the new present letters from ""sport"" are O and T. Therefore, the secret word contains at least R, O, T.

But wait, the feedback for ""sport"" shows three dashes: for O, R, and T. That means all three are present (but in wrong positions). So the secret word contains R, O, and T, and two other letters.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, O, T. So the absent letters are: C, A, N, E, S, P.

We need to choose a word that:
  - Contains R, O, T (since they are present) and two new letters that we haven't tested yet (and are not in the absent list).
  - The positions of R, O, T must not be in the positions we already know are wrong:
      R: not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 4 (from second guess) -> so R must be in position 1, 3, or 5.
      O: not in position 3 (from second guess) -> so O must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
      T: not in position 5 (from second guess) -> so T must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

We also must avoid the absent letters: C, A, N, E, S, P.

We have many letters left that we haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to maximize information by testing new common letters and also trying to place R, O, T in positions that are still possible.

Let's think of words that have R, O, T and two other new letters.

Common letters we haven't used: L, I, D, M, H, etc.

Possible words:

- ""ROTFL"" -> not a word.
- ""MOTOR"" -> has two O's? and we don't know if O is duplicated? Also, R is at the end? But we can try to avoid duplicates for now? Also, we have to avoid the absent letters.

But note: we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. However, to be safe, we can avoid duplicates for now.

Another idea: ""THROW"" -> but we have W, and H. However, we have to check the letters: T, H, R, O, W. 
  - T: present, but we are putting it at position 1 -> but we don't know if it's allowed at 1? The constraint is T not at 5, so 1 is okay.
  - H: not tested yet.
  - R: present, at position 3 -> which is a possible position (since R can be at 1,3,5). But we know R is not at 2 or 4, so 3 is okay.
  - O: present, at position 4 -> which is allowed (O can be at 1,2,4,5).
  - W: not tested.

But wait, the word ""THROW"" has T at position 1, H at 2, R at 3, O at 4, W at 5.

Constraints:
  - T at 1: allowed (since T cannot be at 5, but 1 is fine).
  - R at 3: allowed (since R cannot be at 2 or 4, but 3 is fine).
  - O at 4: allowed (since O cannot be at 3, but 4 is fine).

But we have to check if we are violating any known feedback? We are not, because we are placing them in positions that are not forbidden.

However, note that we are testing T at position 1: if we get a dash, that means T is in the word but not at 1 (which we already know it is present, so that would tell us T is not at 1). Similarly for R and O.

But also, we are introducing H and W.

But wait, the word ""THROW"" is a valid word.

Another candidate: ""BROTH"" -> B, R, O, T, H. 
  Positions: B(1), R(2), O(3), T(4), H(5)
  But R is at position 2 -> but we know R cannot be at position 2 (from first guess). So we cannot put R at 2.

So ""BROTH"" is invalid because of R at 2.

Another candidate: ""FORTY"" -> F, O, R, T, Y.
  Positions: F(1), O(2), R(3), T(4), Y(5)
  Check constraints:
    R at 3: allowed (not 2 or 4? 3 is not 2 or 4 -> allowed).
    O at 2: allowed (O can be at 2, since we only know it's not at 3).
    T at 4: allowed (T can be at 4, since we only know it's not at 5).

But note: we are putting T at 4, which is allowed, but if we get a dash for T, that means T is not at 4, which would be new information.

Similarly, O at 2: if we get a dash, then O is not at 2.

So ""FORTY"" is a valid word and tests F and Y.

But we have to avoid absent letters: F and Y are not in the absent list, so okay.

Another candidate: ""DOUBT"" -> but has D, O, U, B, T. But we don't have R? We must include R because we know it's in the word. So we cannot skip R.

So we must have R, O, T.

Let me list words that contain R, O, T and two other letters from the available set.

We can try ""TROIK"" -> not a word.

""TROMP"" -> but P is absent? We know P is absent from the second guess. So we cannot use P.

We must avoid C, A, N, E, S, P.

So ""FORTY"" and ""THROW"" are candidates.

But let's check ""THROW"" again: 
  T at 1: if the secret word has T at 1, we get a check. If not, we get a dash and know T is not at 1.
  H at 2: if present, we get a dash (since if it were in the correct position we'd get a check, but we don't know the position) or if absent we get x. But we are testing H.
  R at 3: same logic.
  O at 4: same.
  W at 5: same.

But note: we know T is present, so if we get a dash for T at 1, that means T is not at 1, so it must be at 2,3, or 4 (but not 5). Similarly, if we get a dash for R at 3, then R is not at 3 (so must be at 1 or 5). And for O at 4, if dash then not at 4 (so at 1,2,5).

Alternatively, ""FORTY"": 
  F at 1: test F.
  O at 2: test O at 2.
  R at 3: test R at 3.
  T at 4: test T at 4.
  Y at 5: test Y.

But we know T is present, and we are putting it at 4. If we get a dash for T, then T is not at 4, so it must be at 1,2,3 (but we are also testing T at 4, so if we get a dash, we know T is in the word but not at 4). Similarly for the others.

I think both are good. But let's see which one covers more common letters.

Common letters: H is more common than F and Y? Actually, H is quite common. Also, W is common. In ""THROW"" we test H and W. In ""FORTY"" we test F and Y. H is more common than F and Y? According to letter frequency, H is more common than F and Y.

But we also have to consider the positions. We have constraints on R, O, T.

Another candidate: ""MORTY"" -> not a word? ""MORAY"" is a word but has A which is absent. 

""TORCH"" -> but C is absent.

""ROWDY"" -> R, O, W, D, Y. 
  Positions: R(1), O(2), W(3), D(4), Y(5)
  Constraints:
    R at 1: allowed (R can be at 1,3,5 -> 1 is allowed).
    O at 2: allowed (O can be at 1,2,4,5 -> 2 is allowed).
    But we are not including T? We must include T because we know it's present. So we cannot skip T.

We must have T.

Another candidate: ""TROLL"" -> T, R, O, L, L -> duplicate L? and we are putting T at 1, R at 2 -> but R at 2 is forbidden! We know R cannot be at 2. So invalid.

""TROUT"" -> T, R, O, U, T -> duplicate T? and we are putting T at 1 and 5? But we know T is present, but we don't know if it appears twice. Also, R at 3: allowed. O at 4: allowed. But we have two T's? And we are putting T at 1 and 5. We know T is not at 5 (from the feedback of ""sport"": T at 5 was wrong, but that doesn't mean T cannot be at 5? Actually, the feedback for T in ""sport"" was at position 5 and it was a dash, meaning T is in the word but not at 5. So if we put T at 5 again, we know it will be a dash again. But we are also putting T at 1. So if the word has two T's, then we might get a check for T at 1 and a dash for T at 5? But we don't know if there are two T's.

But to avoid complexity, let's avoid duplicates for now.

So back to ""THROW"" and ""FORTY"". 

I think ""THROW"" is a better choice because it tests H and W, which are common, and places the known letters in positions that are allowed and might give us more positional information.

But note: in ""THROW"", we are putting R at position 3. We know R is not at 2 or 4, so 3 is a candidate. Similarly, O at 4 is allowed (since we only know it's not at 3). T at 1 is allowed (since we know it's not at 5).

So I choose ""THROW"".

But wait, what about the possibility that the word has duplicate letters? We are not testing that, but we can handle that later.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a vowel we haven't tested? We haven't tested I, U. But we have O already, which is a vowel.

But ""THROW"" doesn't have I or U.

Another candidate: ""FRUIT"" -> but F, R, U, I, T -> but we have R and T, and we are testing F, U, I. However, we are missing O? We know O is present, so we must include O. So we cannot skip O.

We must include all three: R, O, T.

So ""FRUIT"" doesn't have O.

""ROTUND"" -> too long.

""QUORT"" -> not a word.

I think ""THROW"" is a good choice.

So I'll go with ""THROW"".

But let me confirm the letters: T, H, R, O, W. 
  - T: present, at position 1 (allowed because T cannot be at 5, but 1 is okay)
  - H: new
  - R: present, at position 3 (allowed because R cannot be at 2 or 4, and 3 is not 2 or 4)
  - O: present, at position 4 (allowed because O cannot be at 3, and 4 is not 3)
  - W: new

And we avoid C, A, N, E, S, P.

So <guess>throw</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
  Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - R is in the secret word but **not in position 2**.  
  - C, A, N, E are **not in the word**.  

- **Guess 2: ""sport""**  
  Feedback: S(x), P(x), O(-), R(-), T(-)  
  Interpretation:  
  - O is in the word but **not in position 3**.  
  - R is in the word but **not in position 4** (consistent with prior knowledge).  
  - T is in the word but **not in position 5**.  
  - S and P are **not in the word**.  

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed Letters**:  
   - **R, O, T** are in the secret word.  
   - **Absent Letters**: C, A, N, E, S, P (cannot be used).  

2. **Position Constraints**:  
   - **R**: Cannot be in positions 2 or 4 → must be in **1, 3, or 5**.  
   - **O**: Cannot be in position 3 → must be in **1, 2, 4, or 5**.  
   - **T**: Cannot be in position 5 → must be in **1, 2, 3, or 4**.  

3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:  
   - Must include **R, O, T** (since all are confirmed present).  
   - Must avoid absent letters (C, A, N, E, S, P).  
   - Test **new common letters** (e.g., H, W) to maximize information.  
   - Place R, O, T in **new positions** to narrow down their locations:  
     - R in position 3 (allowed, and not tested before).  
     - O in position 4 (allowed, and not tested before).  
     - T in position 1 (allowed, and not tested before).  

### Why ""THROW""?
- **Fits all constraints**:  
  - Contains R (position 3), O (position 4), T (position 1).  
  - Avoids absent letters (C, A, N, E, S, P).  
  - Tests **H** (position 2) and **W** (position 5), which are common letters not yet tried.  
- **Maximizes information**:  
  - Tests T at position 1 (if ✔, T is confirmed at 1; if ✗, T is not at 1).  
  - Tests R at position 3 (if ✔, R is confirmed at 3; if ✗, R is not at 3).  
  - Tests O at position 4 (if ✔, O is confirmed at 4; if ✗, O is not at 4).  
  - Tests H and W for presence/absence.

But note that the word must have R and no C, A, N, E.\n\n Let\'s think of common letters that we haven\'t used: \n We haven\'t used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n We also know that R is in the word, so we can try to put R in a position other than 2.\n\n Since the word has 5 letters and R is one of them, we have 4 more letters to find.\n\n We should try to include other common consonants and vowels to get more information.\n\n Common consonants: S, T, L, D, M, etc.\n Common vowels: O, I.\n\n A good strategy is to try a word that has R in a different position and includes other common letters.\n\n Let\'s consider the positions: \n Position 1: R could be here? But we don\'t know.\n Position 2: we know R is not here (because in the first guess R was at position 2 and it was wrong position, so it must be in one of 1,3,4,5).\n\n We can try to put R at position 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\n Also, we want to avoid the letters that are already known to be absent: C, A, N, E.\n\n Let\'s think of words that have R and other common letters.\n\n Example: \n - ""ROAST"" -> but A is absent, so we cannot use A.\n - ""ROBOT"" -> has O and B, T, but we don\'t know about O and B. However, we have to avoid A and E? Actually, we can use any letters except the ones we know are absent? But we know A and E are absent, so we must avoid them.\n\n We must avoid C, A, N, E.\n\n So, for the next guess, we can try a word that has R and also includes other common letters that we haven\'t tested, such as S, T, L, O, I, etc.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word without A, E, C, N.\n\n Some options:\n - ""SPORT"": has S, P, O, R, T -> R is at position 4. But we don\'t know if R is at 4. Also, we can test S, P, O, T.\n - ""FIRST"": has F, I, R, S, T -> R is at position 3. This tests F, I, S, T and R (which we know is present).\n - ""THIRD"": has T, H, I, R, D -> R at position 4.\n\n However, note that we have only one known letter (R) and we want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\n Another idea: since R is the only known letter, we can try to use a word that has R and four new letters.\n\n Let\'s choose a word that has R in a position we haven\'t tested (so not position 2) and that uses common letters.\n\n Consider ""ROTIS"" but that might not be common. Instead, let\'s use ""STORM"": \n - S, T, O, R, M -> R is at position 4. This tests S, T, O, M and we know R is present.\n\n But wait, we have to make sure the word is valid. ""STORM"" is a valid word.\n\n However, we have to avoid the absent letters: C, A, N, E. ""STORM"" does not contain any of these.\n\n Alternatively, ""SPORT"" is also valid.\n\n But note: we want to cover more vowels? We haven\'t tested O and I. ""STORM"" has O.\n\n Another candidate: ""BRISK"" -> but we don\'t know if B is present? And we haven\'t tested B. However, we are allowed to use B because it hasn\'t been ruled out.\n\n But we have to consider that we have limited guesses. We want to maximize information.\n\n Since we know R is in the word, we can try to put R at the beginning? Let\'s try a word with R at position 1.\n\n Example: ""ROBOT"" -> but has O and B, T. However, we must avoid A and E? Yes, and it does. But we also have to avoid C, A, N, E. ""ROBOT"" is okay.\n\n However, we have two O\'s? Actually, ""ROBOT"" has two O\'s? No: R-O-B-O-T -> two O\'s? Actually, it has one O at position 2 and one at position 4? Wait, no: positions: 1:R, 2:O, 3:B, 4:O, 5:T -> two O\'s. That might not be ideal because if the word has only one O, we might get confusing feedback.\n\n Alternatively, ""RUSTY"": R at position 1, and U, S, T, Y. This tests U, S, T, Y and R.\n\n But we don\'t know if the word has U, S, T, Y.\n\n Another idea: ""TRIPS"": T, R, I, P, S -> R at position 2? But wait, we know R is not at position 2? Because in the first guess R was at position 2 and it was wrong. So we should avoid putting R at position 2 again? Actually, we can put R at position 2 again? The feedback said it was in the word but wrong position. That doesn\'t mean it can\'t be at position 2 in a different word? No, because the secret word has R in some position, and we know it\'s not position 2 (because if it were, we would have gotten a check). So R must be in one of the other positions: 1,3,4,5.\n\n Therefore, we should avoid putting R at position 2 in the next guess? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we know it\'s not there. So we should try R in a new position.\n\n So let\'s avoid position 2 for R.\n\n We can try R at position 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\n I think a good candidate is ""SPORT"": \n - S at 1, P at 2, O at 3, R at 4, T at 5.\n\n This way, we test S, P, O, T and R (which we know is present) and we put R at position 4.\n\n Another candidate: ""DRINK"" -> but D, R, I, N, K -> but N is absent! We cannot use N because we know it\'s not in the word. So ""DRINK"" is invalid because N is absent? Actually, no: the feedback for the first guess said N is absent, meaning the secret word does not contain N. So we must not use N in our next guess.\n\n Similarly, we cannot use C, A, E.\n\n Therefore, we must choose a word that does not contain C, A, N, E.\n\n Let\'s list some words without these letters and that have R in a position other than 2:\n\n - Position 1: R (e.g., ""ROTOS"" not a word, ""ROBOT"" has two O\'s and we don\'t know if O is present, but it\'s acceptable. However, we can use ""ROILS"": R, O, I, L, S -> but we don\'t know if O, I, L, S are present. And it avoids the forbidden letters.\n - Position 3: e.g., ""BIRDS"" -> B, I, R, D, S -> but S is common. However, we have to avoid A, E, C, N -> okay.\n - Position 4: e.g., ""SPORT"" as above.\n - Position 5: e.g., ""FUROR"" -> but has two R\'s? And two O\'s? Not ideal.\n\n After considering, I think ""SPORT"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and we haven\'t tested S, P, O, T.\n\n Alternatively, ""STRIP"": S, T, R, I, P -> but R is at position 3? And we avoid forbidden letters. However, we are testing S, T, R, I, P. But note: we are putting R at position 3, which is a new position.\n\n But wait, ""STRIP"" has R at position 3? Let\'s see: \n S (1), T (2), R (3), I (4), P (5). That\'s okay.\n\n However, we are also testing S and T at the same time.\n\n Another candidate: ""ROOMY"" -> R at 1, but has two O\'s and we don\'t know if O is present. It might be less efficient.\n\n I think ""SPORT"" is a solid choice.\n\n But note: we are trying to get as much information as possible. We have 4 new letters: S, P, O, T. And we know R is present so we are also confirming the position of R (if we get a check for R at position 4, then we know it\'s there; if we get a dash, then R is in the word but not at 4, which we already know so it doesn\'t help? Actually, we know R is in the word, but we don\'t know the position. So if we put R at position 4 and get a dash, that means R is not at 4, so we can eliminate position 4. Similarly, if we get a check, we know R is at 4.\n\n So let\'s go with ""SPORT"".\n\n If we get feedback that R is at position 4 (check), then we know the fourth letter is R. If we get a dash, then R is not at 4, so it must be at 1, 3, or 5.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""SPORT"".\n\n<guess>sport</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- ""R"" is in the secret word but not in the second position (indicated by ""-"").\n- ""C"", ""A"", ""N"", and ""E"" are not in the secret word at all (indicated by ""x"").\n\nFor the second guess:\n- The word must include ""R"" (since it\'s confirmed present) but avoid placing it in position 2 again.\n- It should exclude ""C"", ""A"", ""N"", and ""E"" (known absent letters).\n- To maximize information, I prioritized common unused letters (S, T, O, P) and placed ""R"" in a new position (position 4) to test its location.\n\nThe word ""SPORT"" fits these criteria:\n- Contains ""R"" in position 4 (a new position to test).\n- Introduces new common letters: S, T, O, P.\n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, A, N, E).\n\nThis guess will help narrow down the position of ""R"" and reveal which of the new letters (S, T, O, P) are present.\n\n<guess>sport</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: sport -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(-) R(-) T(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\n  Meaning:\n    - R is in the word but not in position 2.\n    - C, A, N, E are not in the word.\n\nGuess 2: ""sport"" -> S(x) P(x) O(-) R(-) T(-)\n  Meaning:\n    - O is in the word but not in position 3.\n    - R is in the word but not in position 4 (we already knew R was present and not in position 2, now we know also not in 4).\n    - T is in the word but not in position 5.\n    - S and P are not in the word.\n\nSo now we know:\n  Present letters: R, O, T (and we know R is not in positions 2 or 4, O is not in position 3, T is not in position 5)\n  Absent letters: C, A, N, E, S, P\n\nWe also know that the word must contain at least three letters from the set {R, O, T} (since we have three \'-\' in the feedback for ""sport"", meaning three letters are present but in wrong positions). However, note that R was already known to be present from the first guess, so the new present letters from ""sport"" are O and T. Therefore, the secret word contains at least R, O, T.\n\nBut wait, the feedback for ""sport"" shows three dashes: for O, R, and T. That means all three are present (but in wrong positions). So the secret word contains R, O, and T, and two other letters.\n\nWe have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, O, T. So the absent letters are: C, A, N, E, S, P.\n\nWe need to choose a word that:\n  - Contains R, O, T (since they are present) and two new letters that we haven\'t tested yet (and are not in the absent list).\n  - The positions of R, O, T must not be in the positions we already know are wrong:\n      R: not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 4 (from second guess) -> so R must be in position 1, 3, or 5.\n      O: not in position 3 (from second guess) -> so O must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n      T: not in position 5 (from second guess) -> so T must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nWe also must avoid the absent letters: C, A, N, E, S, P.\n\nWe have many letters left that we haven\'t tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe want to maximize information by testing new common letters and also trying to place R, O, T in positions that are still possible.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have R, O, T and two other new letters.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t used: L, I, D, M, H, etc.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""ROTFL"" -> not a word.\n- ""MOTOR"" -> has two O\'s? and we don\'t know if O is duplicated? Also, R is at the end? But we can try to avoid duplicates for now? Also, we have to avoid the absent letters.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters. However, to be safe, we can avoid duplicates for now.\n\nAnother idea: ""THROW"" -> but we have W, and H. However, we have to check the letters: T, H, R, O, W. \n  - T: present, but we are putting it at position 1 -> but we don\'t know if it\'s allowed at 1? The constraint is T not at 5, so 1 is okay.\n  - H: not tested yet.\n  - R: present, at position 3 -> which is a possible position (since R can be at 1,3,5). But we know R is not at 2 or 4, so 3 is okay.\n  - O: present, at position 4 -> which is allowed (O can be at 1,2,4,5).\n  - W: not tested.\n\nBut wait, the word ""THROW"" has T at position 1, H at 2, R at 3, O at 4, W at 5.\n\nConstraints:\n  - T at 1: allowed (since T cannot be at 5, but 1 is fine).\n  - R at 3: allowed (since R cannot be at 2 or 4, but 3 is fine).\n  - O at 4: allowed (since O cannot be at 3, but 4 is fine).\n\nBut we have to check if we are violating any known feedback? We are not, because we are placing them in positions that are not forbidden.\n\nHowever, note that we are testing T at position 1: if we get a dash, that means T is in the word but not at 1 (which we already know it is present, so that would tell us T is not at 1). Similarly for R and O.\n\nBut also, we are introducing H and W.\n\nBut wait, the word ""THROW"" is a valid word.\n\nAnother candidate: ""BROTH"" -> B, R, O, T, H. \n  Positions: B(1), R(2), O(3), T(4), H(5)\n  But R is at position 2 -> but we know R cannot be at position 2 (from first guess). So we cannot put R at 2.\n\nSo ""BROTH"" is invalid because of R at 2.\n\nAnother candidate: ""FORTY"" -> F, O, R, T, Y.\n  Positions: F(1), O(2), R(3), T(4), Y(5)\n  Check constraints:\n    R at 3: allowed (not 2 or 4? 3 is not 2 or 4 -> allowed).\n    O at 2: allowed (O can be at 2, since we only know it\'s not at 3).\n    T at 4: allowed (T can be at 4, since we only know it\'s not at 5).\n\nBut note: we are putting T at 4, which is allowed, but if we get a dash for T, that means T is not at 4, which would be new information.\n\nSimilarly, O at 2: if we get a dash, then O is not at 2.\n\nSo ""FORTY"" is a valid word and tests F and Y.\n\nBut we have to avoid absent letters: F and Y are not in the absent list, so okay.\n\nAnother candidate: ""DOUBT"" -> but has D, O, U, B, T. But we don\'t have R? We must include R because we know it\'s in the word. So we cannot skip R.\n\nSo we must have R, O, T.\n\nLet me list words that contain R, O, T and two other letters from the available set.\n\nWe can try ""TROIK"" -> not a word.\n\n""TROMP"" -> but P is absent? We know P is absent from the second guess. So we cannot use P.\n\nWe must avoid C, A, N, E, S, P.\n\nSo ""FORTY"" and ""THROW"" are candidates.\n\nBut let\'s check ""THROW"" again: \n  T at 1: if the secret word has T at 1, we get a check. If not, we get a dash and know T is not at 1.\n  H at 2: if present, we get a dash (since if it were in the correct position we\'d get a check, but we don\'t know the position) or if absent we get x. But we are testing H.\n  R at 3: same logic.\n  O at 4: same.\n  W at 5: same.\n\nBut note: we know T is present, so if we get a dash for T at 1, that means T is not at 1, so it must be at 2,3, or 4 (but not 5). Similarly, if we get a dash for R at 3, then R is not at 3 (so must be at 1 or 5). And for O at 4, if dash then not at 4 (so at 1,2,5).\n\nAlternatively, ""FORTY"": \n  F at 1: test F.\n  O at 2: test O at 2.\n  R at 3: test R at 3.\n  T at 4: test T at 4.\n  Y at 5: test Y.\n\nBut we know T is present, and we are putting it at 4. If we get a dash for T, then T is not at 4, so it must be at 1,2,3 (but we are also testing T at 4, so if we get a dash, we know T is in the word but not at 4). Similarly for the others.\n\nI think both are good. But let\'s see which one covers more common letters.\n\nCommon letters: H is more common than F and Y? Actually, H is quite common. Also, W is common. In ""THROW"" we test H and W. In ""FORTY"" we test F and Y. H is more common than F and Y? According to letter frequency, H is more common than F and Y.\n\nBut we also have to consider the positions. We have constraints on R, O, T.\n\nAnother candidate: ""MORTY"" -> not a word? ""MORAY"" is a word but has A which is absent. \n\n""TORCH"" -> but C is absent.\n\n""ROWDY"" -> R, O, W, D, Y. \n  Positions: R(1), O(2), W(3), D(4), Y(5)\n  Constraints:\n    R at 1: allowed (R can be at 1,3,5 -> 1 is allowed).\n    O at 2: allowed (O can be at 1,2,4,5 -> 2 is allowed).\n    But we are not including T? We must include T because we know it\'s present. So we cannot skip T.\n\nWe must have T.\n\nAnother candidate: ""TROLL"" -> T, R, O, L, L -> duplicate L? and we are putting T at 1, R at 2 -> but R at 2 is forbidden! We know R cannot be at 2. So invalid.\n\n""TROUT"" -> T, R, O, U, T -> duplicate T? and we are putting T at 1 and 5? But we know T is present, but we don\'t know if it appears twice. Also, R at 3: allowed. O at 4: allowed. But we have two T\'s? And we are putting T at 1 and 5. We know T is not at 5 (from the feedback of ""sport"": T at 5 was wrong, but that doesn\'t mean T cannot be at 5? Actually, the feedback for T in ""sport"" was at position 5 and it was a dash, meaning T is in the word but not at 5. So if we put T at 5 again, we know it will be a dash again. But we are also putting T at 1. So if the word has two T\'s, then we might get a check for T at 1 and a dash for T at 5? But we don\'t know if there are two T\'s.\n\nBut to avoid complexity, let\'s avoid duplicates for now.\n\nSo back to ""THROW"" and ""FORTY"". \n\nI think ""THROW"" is a better choice because it tests H and W, which are common, and places the known letters in positions that are allowed and might give us more positional information.\n\nBut note: in ""THROW"", we are putting R at position 3. We know R is not at 2 or 4, so 3 is a candidate. Similarly, O at 4 is allowed (since we only know it\'s not at 3). T at 1 is allowed (since we know it\'s not at 5).\n\nSo I choose ""THROW"".\n\nBut wait, what about the possibility that the word has duplicate letters? We are not testing that, but we can handle that later.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that uses a vowel we haven\'t tested? We haven\'t tested I, U. But we have O already, which is a vowel.\n\nBut ""THROW"" doesn\'t have I or U.\n\nAnother candidate: ""FRUIT"" -> but F, R, U, I, T -> but we have R and T, and we are testing F, U, I. However, we are missing O? We know O is present, so we must include O. So we cannot skip O.\n\nWe must include all three: R, O, T.\n\nSo ""FRUIT"" doesn\'t have O.\n\n""ROTUND"" -> too long.\n\n""QUORT"" -> not a word.\n\nI think ""THROW"" is a good choice.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""THROW"".\n\nBut let me confirm the letters: T, H, R, O, W. \n  - T: present, at position 1 (allowed because T cannot be at 5, but 1 is okay)\n  - H: new\n  - R: present, at position 3 (allowed because R cannot be at 2 or 4, and 3 is not 2 or 4)\n  - O: present, at position 4 (allowed because O cannot be at 3, and 4 is not 3)\n  - W: new\n\nAnd we avoid C, A, N, E, S, P.\n\nSo <guess>throw</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n- **Guess 1: ""crane""**  \n  Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)  \n  Interpretation:  \n  - R is in the secret word but **not in position 2**.  \n  - C, A, N, E are **not in the word**.  \n\n- **Guess 2: ""sport""**  \n  Feedback: S(x), P(x), O(-), R(-), T(-)  \n  Interpretation:  \n  - O is in the word but **not in position 3**.  \n  - R is in the word but **not in position 4** (consistent with prior knowledge).  \n  - T is in the word but **not in position 5**.  \n  - S and P are **not in the word**.  \n\n### Key Insights:\n1. **Confirmed Letters**:  \n   - **R, O, T** are in the secret word.  \n   - **Absent Letters**: C, A, N, E, S, P (cannot be used).  \n\n2. **Position Constraints**:  \n   - **R**: Cannot be in positions 2 or 4 → must be in **1, 3, or 5**.  \n   - **O**: Cannot be in position 3 → must be in **1, 2, 4, or 5**.  \n   - **T**: Cannot be in position 5 → must be in **1, 2, 3, or 4**.  \n\n3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:  \n   - Must include **R, O, T** (since all are confirmed present).  \n   - Must avoid absent letters (C, A, N, E, S, P).  \n   - Test **new common letters** (e.g., H, W) to maximize information.  \n   - Place R, O, T in **new positions** to narrow down their locations:  \n     - R in position 3 (allowed, and not tested before).  \n     - O in position 4 (allowed, and not tested before).  \n     - T in position 1 (allowed, and not tested before).  \n\n### Why ""THROW""?\n- **Fits all constraints**:  \n  - Contains R (position 3), O (position 4), T (position 1).  \n  - Avoids absent letters (C, A, N, E, S, P).  \n  - Tests **H** (position 2) and **W** (position 5), which are common letters not yet tried.  \n- **Maximizes information**:  \n  - Tests T at position 1 (if ✔, T is confirmed at 1; if ✗, T is not at 1).  \n  - Tests R at position 3 (if ✔, R is confirmed at 3; if ✗, R is not at 3).  \n  - Tests O at position 4 (if ✔, O is confirmed at 4; if ✗, O is not at 4).  \n  - Tests H and W for presence/absence.\n\n<guess>throw</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: sport -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(-) R(-) T(-)\nGuess 3: throw -> FEEDBACK: T(-) H(-) R(✓) O(-) W(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have the following feedback history:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- C, A, N, E are absent.

Guess 2: sport -> S(x) P(x) O(-) R(-) T(-)
- O is present but not in position 3.
- R is present but not in position 4 (consistent with prior, since we knew R wasn't in position 2).
- T is present but not in position 5.
- S, P are absent.

Guess 3: throw -> T(-) H(-) R(✓) O(-) W(-)
- R is in the correct position (position 3). So the third letter is R.
- T is present but not in position 1 (since we got a dash for T at position 1).
- H is present but not in position 2.
- O is present but not in position 4 (we put O at position 4 and got a dash).
- W is present? Actually, the feedback for W is a dash, which means W is in the word but not in position 5? But let's recall the feedback symbols: 
  ✓: correct letter and position.
  -: letter is in the word but wrong position.
  x: letter not in the word.

So for ""throw"": 
- T: - → T is in the word, but not at position 1.
- H: - → H is in the word, but not at position 2.
- R: ✓ → R is correct at position 3.
- O: - → O is in the word, but not at position 4.
- W: - → W is in the word, but not at position 5.

Therefore, we now know:
- The secret word has the third letter as **R** (fixed).
- **T, H, O, W** are all present in the word (since we got dashes for each, meaning they are in the word but in wrong positions).

Additionally, we know from previous feedback:
- O is not in position 3 (from guess 2) but now position 3 is taken by R, so that's consistent.
- T is not in position 1 (from this guess) and not in position 5 (from guess 2).
- O is not in position 3 (guess 2) and not in position 4 (guess 3).
- R is confirmed in position 3, so we don't need to worry about its position anymore.

We also have absent letters: C, A, N, E, S, P.

The word must contain: T, H, O, W, and R (but R is fixed at position 3).

Since the word has 5 letters and we know one letter (R at position 3), the other four letters are T, H, O, W.

So the secret word is composed of exactly: T, H, O, W, R. And R is in position 3.

So the pattern is: _ _ R _ _

We need to assign T, H, O, W to positions 1,2,4,5, with constraints:

For T:
- Cannot be in position 1 (from guess 3) and cannot be in position 5 (from guess 2). So T must be in position 2 or 4.

For O:
- Cannot be in position 3 (guess 2) and cannot be in position 4 (guess 3). So O must be in position 1, 2, or 5.

For H:
- Cannot be in position 2 (from guess 3). So H must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

For W:
- Cannot be in position 5 (from guess 3). So W must be in position 1, 2, or 4.

Now, let's list possible permutations:

We have to assign T, H, O, W to positions 1,2,4,5 respecting the constraints.

Possible positions:
- Position 1: O, H, W (since O, H, W are allowed here, T is not allowed at 1)
- Position 2: T, O, W (H is not allowed at 2, so only T, O, W)
- Position 4: T, H, W (O is not allowed at 4, so not O)
- Position 5: O, H (W is not allowed at 5, T is not allowed at 5, so only O or H)

Now, position 5 must be either O or H.

Case 1: Position 5 is O.
Then O is at position 5. Now, O cannot be at position 4 (already satisfied) and position 3 (satisfied).
Then positions left: 1,2,4 for T, H, W.

Position 4: cannot be O (which is assigned), so it must be T, H, or W.
But O is assigned to 5, so position 4: T, H, or W.

Constraints for position 4: O is not allowed, so T, H, W are all allowed? Yes, because no direct constraint on T, H, W at position 4, except that they must be placed appropriately.

Position 2: must be T, O, or W; but O is used at 5, so position 2: T or W.

Position 1: O, H, W; O is used, so position 1: H or W.

Now, we have:
- Position 1: H or W
- Position 2: T or W
- Position 4: T, H, or W (but since letters are distinct, we need to assign without duplication)

Subcases:

If position 2 is T, then:
Position 2 is T.
Then position 1: H or W.
Position 4: the remaining between T, H, W: but T is used at 2, so position 4: H or W.
Then position 1: the other of H or W.

So possibilities:
1. Position 1: H, position 2: T, position 4: W, position 5: O → H T R W O → ""HTRWO""? Not a word? ""H T R W O"" does not form a common word.

2. Position 1: W, position 2: T, position 4: H, position 5: O → W T R H O → ""WTRHO""? Not a recognized word.

But we need valid English words.

Alternative: if position 2 is W, then:
Position 2 is W.
Then position 1: H or W? But W cannot be duplicated? We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but so far we have no duplicates. Assume no duplicates for now.
Position 1: H or W -> since W is used at 2, position 1 must be H (since if W, duplicate? But we have only one W? We have only one of each letter? Actually, we don't know, but let's avoid duplicates until forced.

So position 1: H (since W is at 2).
Position 4: T or H? H is used at 1, so position 4: T.
Position 5: O.
So word: H (1), W (2), R (3), T (4), O (5) → ""H W R T O"" → ""HWRTO"" is not a word? 

""throb""? ""throb"" has B, but we don't have B? The word must be only from T,H,O,W,R? And R at position 3? ""throb"" is T,H,R,O,B → five letters: positions: T(1), H(2), R(3), O(4), B(5). But we don't have B in the known letters? We have W, not B. So that doesn't work.

Similarly, other permutations:

Case 2: Position 5 is H.
Then position 5: H.

Then positions left: 1,2,4 for T, O, W.

Constraints:
Position 1: O, H, W → H is used, so O or W.
Position 2: T, O, W → T, O, or W.
Position 4: T, H, W → H is used, so T or W.

Also, O cannot be at position 4.

Subcases:

Option: Position 4 must be T or W.

If position 4 is T, then:
Position 4: T.
Then positions 1 and 2: O and W.

Position 1: O or W.
Position 2: O, W, or T (but T used) → so O or W.

Constraints for O: cannot be at position 4 (which is taken by T) and cannot at position 3 (already), so O can be at 1 or 2.

Similarly, W: no specific constraint for these positions other than not at 5 (but 5 is taken by H).

So assign:
Possibility 1: Position 1: O, position 2: W, position 4: T, position 5: H → O W R T H → ""OWRTH""? Not a common word.

Possibility 2: Position 1: W, position 2: O, position 4: T, position 5: H → W O R T H → ""WORTH""? Yes! ""WORTH"" is a valid English word.

Now, check if it breaks any constraint:
- T at position 4: T cannot be at 5? Yes, position 4 is allowed. And not prohibited for T at 4? We don't have feedback that T cannot be at 4. In fact, we only know T not at 1 (from throw) and not at 5 (from sport). So T can be at 4.
- O at position 2: O cannot be at 3 (from sport) and cannot be at 4 (from throw). Position 2 is not 3 or 4, so allowed.
- W at position 1: no constraint, allowed.
- H at position 5: W cannot be at 5? Yes, we know from throw that W is not at 5, but H? There was no constraint on H's position except that it cannot be at position 2 (from throw). Position 5 is not 2, so allowed.

So ""WORTH"" fits all the feedback.

But let me confirm all feedback:

Secret word is ""WORTH""?
- Positions: W(1), O(2), R(3), T(4), H(5)

Now, check against previous guesses:

Guess 1: crane
- C: not in → x
- R: in the word but at position 3 (in crane at position 2) → so wrong position → - → matches
- A: not in → x
- N: not in → x
- E: not in → x → matches.

Guess 2: sport
- S: not in → x
- P: not in → x
- O: in the word at position 2? In sport O was at position 3, but in secret it is at 2 → wrong position → - → matches.
- R: in the word at position 3? In sport R was at position 4, and in secret it is at position 3 → so wrong position → - → matches? But wait, the secret has R at position 3, which is correct, but in sport we guessed R at position 4, so it should be dash because it's present but not at position 4. So yes, dash is correct.
- T: in the word at position 4? In sport T was at position 5, and in secret it is at position 4 → not at 5, so wrong position → - → matches.

Guess 3: throw
- T: in the word at position 4? In throw we guessed T at position 1, and secret has T at 4 → so present but not position 1 → -
- H: in the word at position 5? In throw we guessed H at position 2, secret has H at 5 → present but not position 2 → -
- R: at position 3 → correct → ✓
- O: in the word at position 2? In throw we guessed O at position 4, and secret has O at position 2 → present but not at 4 → -
- W: in the word at position 1? In throw we guessed W at position 5, and secret has W at position 1 → present but not at 5 → -

So all feedback matches.

Therefore, our next guess should be ""WORTH"".

But note: we have one more thing. We are to make a new guess. We think the word is ""WORTH"", but we need to guess it. Since we have 6 tries, we can try ""WORTH"".

Alternatively, we might have other possibilities. For example, is there another word that fits the constraints?

For instance, with position 5: O? But we saw ""HWRTO"" is not a word.

Or position 5: H? We have ""WORTH"", but are there other words?

Suppose the word has duplicate letters? But in this case, all letters T, H, O, W, R are distinct, so no duplicates.

Another possibility: position 5 is H, and we assigned W,O,R,T,H as ""WORTH"", but perhaps other orders.

For example, is ""ROWTH"" a word? ""ROWTH"" is not standard. ""GROWTH"" has G. But we cannot have G? We haven't tested G, but in our assignment, we have only T,H,O,W,R and we must use these letters.

Another arrangement: if position 5 is H, then position 4 could be W? But only T or W for position 4? No, in case position 5 is H, position 4 must be T or W.

If position 4 is W, then positions 1 and 2: T and O.

Position 1: O or W -> but W used? So position 1: O or T? But position 1 constraint: O or W? But W is used, so O.

Then position 2: T (since O is used at 1, T must be at 2).

Position 4: W.

Word: O (1), T (2), R (3), W (4), H (5) → ""O T R W H"" → ""OTRWH"" is not a word.

Therefore, ""WORTH"" is the only plausible word we've found.

So we can guess ""WORTH"".

We have 3 guesses left after this? This would be the fourth guess.

But note: we are not certain that ""WORTH"" is the word? We might have missed something.

Another solution: maybe with duplicate letters? But we have no indication yet.

Perhaps I missed a word. Is ""WHORT"" a word? ""Whort"" is a variant of ""whortleberry"", but it's 5 letters? And it means an edible berry? But it's obscure. ""WORTH"" is more common.

Another possibility: ""WROTH"" is an archaic word meaning angry, but it might be acceptable? And it uses WROTH: W(1), R(2), O(3), T(4), H(5)? But wait, the third letter must be R, and in ""WROTH"" it would be W(1), R(2), O(3), T(4), H(5). But position 3 is O? But we know position 3 is R. So ""WROTH"" has R at position 2, which is forbidden since from guess 1, R is not at position 2.

Therefore, ""WORTH"" is our best bet.

So I will guess ""WORTH"".

### Thought Process:

We have feedback from three previous guesses:
1. **Guess 1: crane**  
   - C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x) → R is present (not position 2), C/A/N/E absent.
2. **Guess 2: sport**  
   - S(x), P(x), O(-), R(-), T(-) → O/T present (O not position 3, R not position 4, T not position 5), S/P absent.
3. **Guess 3: throw**  
   - T(-), H(-), R(✓), O(-), W(-) → R fixed at position 3; T/H/O/W present but not positions 1/2/4/5 respectively.

### Key Insights:
- **Secret word structure**: `_ _ R _ _` (R confirmed at position 3).
- **Present letters**: T, H, O, W (all must appear).
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E, S, P (cannot be used).
- **Position constraints**:
  - **T**: Not positions 1 (from throw) or 5 (from sport) → must be position 2 or 4.
  - **H**: Not position 2 (from throw) → must be position 1, 4, or 5.
  - **O**: Not position 3 (from sport) or 4 (from throw) → must be position 1, 2, or 5.
  - **W**: Not position 5 (from throw) → must be position 1, 2, or 4.
- **Word must be composed of**: T, H, O, W, R.

### Deduction:
- **Position 5**: Only H or O can be here (since T and W are forbidden at position 5, and only H/O remain as options for position 5).
  - **If position 5 is O**: Positions 1/2/4 for T/H/W lead to invalid words (e.g., ""HTRWO"" or ""WTRHO"" are not valid English words).
  - **If position 5 is H**: Positions 1/2/4 for T/O/W yield:
    - Option: Position 1 = W, Position 2 = O, Position 4 = T → Forms ""WORTH"".
- **Validation**:
  - WORTH = W(1), O(2), R(3), T(4), H(5).
  - Satisfies constraints:
    - T not position 1 or 5 → at position 4 ✅.
    - H not position 2 → at position 5 ✅.
    - O not position 3 or 4 → at position 2 ✅.
    - W not position 5 → at position 1 ✅.
  - Uses required letters: T, H, O, W, R.
  - Avoids absent letters.

Given ""WORTH"" fits all feedback and constraints, it is the most probable solution.

<guess>worth</guess>",worth,"We have the following feedback history:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- C, A, N, E are absent.

Guess 2: sport -> S(x) P(x) O(-) R(-) T(-)
- O is present but not in position 3.
- R is present but not in position 4 (consistent with prior, since we knew R wasn't in position 2).
- T is present but not in position 5.
- S, P are absent.

Guess 3: throw -> T(-) H(-) R(✓) O(-) W(-)
- R is in the correct position (position 3). So the third letter is R.
- T is present but not in position 1 (since we got a dash for T at position 1).
- H is present but not in position 2.
- O is present but not in position 4 (we put O at position 4 and got a dash).
- W is present? Actually, the feedback for W is a dash, which means W is in the word but not in position 5? But let's recall the feedback symbols: 
  ✓: correct letter and position.
  -: letter is in the word but wrong position.
  x: letter not in the word.

So for ""throw"": 
- T: - → T is in the word, but not at position 1.
- H: - → H is in the word, but not at position 2.
- R: ✓ → R is correct at position 3.
- O: - → O is in the word, but not at position 4.
- W: - → W is in the word, but not at position 5.

Therefore, we now know:
- The secret word has the third letter as **R** (fixed).
- **T, H, O, W** are all present in the word (since we got dashes for each, meaning they are in the word but in wrong positions).

Additionally, we know from previous feedback:
- O is not in position 3 (from guess 2) but now position 3 is taken by R, so that's consistent.
- T is not in position 1 (from this guess) and not in position 5 (from guess 2).
- O is not in position 3 (guess 2) and not in position 4 (guess 3).
- R is confirmed in position 3, so we don't need to worry about its position anymore.

We also have absent letters: C, A, N, E, S, P.

The word must contain: T, H, O, W, and R (but R is fixed at position 3).

Since the word has 5 letters and we know one letter (R at position 3), the other four letters are T, H, O, W.

So the secret word is composed of exactly: T, H, O, W, R. And R is in position 3.

So the pattern is: _ _ R _ _

We need to assign T, H, O, W to positions 1,2,4,5, with constraints:

For T:
- Cannot be in position 1 (from guess 3) and cannot be in position 5 (from guess 2). So T must be in position 2 or 4.

For O:
- Cannot be in position 3 (guess 2) and cannot be in position 4 (guess 3). So O must be in position 1, 2, or 5.

For H:
- Cannot be in position 2 (from guess 3). So H must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

For W:
- Cannot be in position 5 (from guess 3). So W must be in position 1, 2, or 4.

Now, let's list possible permutations:

We have to assign T, H, O, W to positions 1,2,4,5 respecting the constraints.

Possible positions:
- Position 1: O, H, W (since O, H, W are allowed here, T is not allowed at 1)
- Position 2: T, O, W (H is not allowed at 2, so only T, O, W)
- Position 4: T, H, W (O is not allowed at 4, so not O)
- Position 5: O, H (W is not allowed at 5, T is not allowed at 5, so only O or H)

Now, position 5 must be either O or H.

Case 1: Position 5 is O.
Then O is at position 5. Now, O cannot be at position 4 (already satisfied) and position 3 (satisfied).
Then positions left: 1,2,4 for T, H, W.

Position 4: cannot be O (which is assigned), so it must be T, H, or W.
But O is assigned to 5, so position 4: T, H, or W.

Constraints for position 4: O is not allowed, so T, H, W are all allowed? Yes, because no direct constraint on T, H, W at position 4, except that they must be placed appropriately.

Position 2: must be T, O, or W; but O is used at 5, so position 2: T or W.

Position 1: O, H, W; O is used, so position 1: H or W.

Now, we have:
- Position 1: H or W
- Position 2: T or W
- Position 4: T, H, or W (but since letters are distinct, we need to assign without duplication)

Subcases:

If position 2 is T, then:
Position 2 is T.
Then position 1: H or W.
Position 4: the remaining between T, H, W: but T is used at 2, so position 4: H or W.
Then position 1: the other of H or W.

So possibilities:
1. Position 1: H, position 2: T, position 4: W, position 5: O → H T R W O → ""HTRWO""? Not a word? ""H T R W O"" does not form a common word.

2. Position 1: W, position 2: T, position 4: H, position 5: O → W T R H O → ""WTRHO""? Not a recognized word.

But we need valid English words.

Alternative: if position 2 is W, then:
Position 2 is W.
Then position 1: H or W? But W cannot be duplicated? We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but so far we have no duplicates. Assume no duplicates for now.
Position 1: H or W -> since W is used at 2, position 1 must be H (since if W, duplicate? But we have only one W? We have only one of each letter? Actually, we don't know, but let's avoid duplicates until forced.

So position 1: H (since W is at 2).
Position 4: T or H? H is used at 1, so position 4: T.
Position 5: O.
So word: H (1), W (2), R (3), T (4), O (5) → ""H W R T O"" → ""HWRTO"" is not a word? 

""throb""? ""throb"" has B, but we don't have B? The word must be only from T,H,O,W,R? And R at position 3? ""throb"" is T,H,R,O,B → five letters: positions: T(1), H(2), R(3), O(4), B(5). But we don't have B in the known letters? We have W, not B. So that doesn't work.

Similarly, other permutations:

Case 2: Position 5 is H.
Then position 5: H.

Then positions left: 1,2,4 for T, O, W.

Constraints:
Position 1: O, H, W → H is used, so O or W.
Position 2: T, O, W → T, O, or W.
Position 4: T, H, W → H is used, so T or W.

Also, O cannot be at position 4.

Subcases:

Option: Position 4 must be T or W.

If position 4 is T, then:
Position 4: T.
Then positions 1 and 2: O and W.

Position 1: O or W.
Position 2: O, W, or T (but T used) → so O or W.

Constraints for O: cannot be at position 4 (which is taken by T) and cannot at position 3 (already), so O can be at 1 or 2.

Similarly, W: no specific constraint for these positions other than not at 5 (but 5 is taken by H).

So assign:
Possibility 1: Position 1: O, position 2: W, position 4: T, position 5: H → O W R T H → ""OWRTH""? Not a common word.

Possibility 2: Position 1: W, position 2: O, position 4: T, position 5: H → W O R T H → ""WORTH""? Yes! ""WORTH"" is a valid English word.

Now, check if it breaks any constraint:
- T at position 4: T cannot be at 5? Yes, position 4 is allowed. And not prohibited for T at 4? We don't have feedback that T cannot be at 4. In fact, we only know T not at 1 (from throw) and not at 5 (from sport). So T can be at 4.
- O at position 2: O cannot be at 3 (from sport) and cannot be at 4 (from throw). Position 2 is not 3 or 4, so allowed.
- W at position 1: no constraint, allowed.
- H at position 5: W cannot be at 5? Yes, we know from throw that W is not at 5, but H? There was no constraint on H's position except that it cannot be at position 2 (from throw). Position 5 is not 2, so allowed.

So ""WORTH"" fits all the feedback.

But let me confirm all feedback:

Secret word is ""WORTH""?
- Positions: W(1), O(2), R(3), T(4), H(5)

Now, check against previous guesses:

Guess 1: crane
- C: not in → x
- R: in the word but at position 3 (in crane at position 2) → so wrong position → - → matches
- A: not in → x
- N: not in → x
- E: not in → x → matches.

Guess 2: sport
- S: not in → x
- P: not in → x
- O: in the word at position 2? In sport O was at position 3, but in secret it is at 2 → wrong position → - → matches.
- R: in the word at position 3? In sport R was at position 4, and in secret it is at position 3 → so wrong position → - → matches? But wait, the secret has R at position 3, which is correct, but in sport we guessed R at position 4, so it should be dash because it's present but not at position 4. So yes, dash is correct.
- T: in the word at position 4? In sport T was at position 5, and in secret it is at position 4 → not at 5, so wrong position → - → matches.

Guess 3: throw
- T: in the word at position 4? In throw we guessed T at position 1, and secret has T at 4 → so present but not position 1 → -
- H: in the word at position 5? In throw we guessed H at position 2, secret has H at 5 → present but not position 2 → -
- R: at position 3 → correct → ✓
- O: in the word at position 2? In throw we guessed O at position 4, and secret has O at position 2 → present but not at 4 → -
- W: in the word at position 1? In throw we guessed W at position 5, and secret has W at position 1 → present but not at 5 → -

So all feedback matches.

Therefore, our next guess should be ""WORTH"".

But note: we have one more thing. We are to make a new guess. We think the word is ""WORTH"", but we need to guess it. Since we have 6 tries, we can try ""WORTH"".

Alternatively, we might have other possibilities. For example, is there another word that fits the constraints?

Or position 5: H? We have ""WORTH"", but are there other words?

Suppose the word has duplicate letters? But in this case, all letters T, H, O, W, R are distinct, so no duplicates.

Another possibility: position 5 is H, and we assigned W,O,R,T,H as ""WORTH"", but perhaps other orders.

For example, is ""ROWTH"" a word? ""ROWTH"" is not standard. ""GROWTH"" has G. But we cannot have G? We haven't tested G, but in our assignment, we have only T,H,O,W,R and we must use these letters.

Another arrangement: if position 5 is H, then position 4 could be W? But only T or W for position 4? No, in case position 5 is H, position 4 must be T or W.

If position 4 is W, then positions 1 and 2: T and O.

Position 1: O or W -> but W used? So position 1: O or T? But position 1 constraint: O or W? But W is used, so O.

Then position 2: T (since O is used at 1, T must be at 2).

Position 4: W.

Word: O (1), T (2), R (3), W (4), H (5) → ""O T R W H"" → ""OTRWH"" is not a word.

Therefore, ""WORTH"" is the only plausible word we've found.

So we can guess ""WORTH"".

We have 3 guesses left after this? This would be the fourth guess.

But note: we are not certain that ""WORTH"" is the word? We might have missed something.

Another solution: maybe with duplicate letters? But we have no indication yet.

Perhaps I missed a word. Is ""WHORT"" a word? ""Whort"" is a variant of ""whortleberry"", but it's 5 letters? And it means an edible berry? But it's obscure. ""WORTH"" is more common.

Another possibility: ""WROTH"" is an archaic word meaning angry, but it might be acceptable? And it uses WROTH: W(1), R(2), O(3), T(4), H(5)? But wait, the third letter must be R, and in ""WROTH"" it would be W(1), R(2), O(3), T(4), H(5). But position 3 is O? But we know position 3 is R. So ""WROTH"" has R at position 2, which is forbidden since from guess 1, R is not at position 2.

Therefore, ""WORTH"" is our best bet.

So I will guess ""WORTH"".### Thought Process:

We have feedback from three previous guesses:
1. **Guess 1: crane**  
   - C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x) → R is present (not position 2), C/A/N/E absent.
2. **Guess 2: sport**  
   - S(x), P(x), O(-), R(-), T(-) → O/T present (O not position 3, R not position 4, T not position 5), S/P absent.
3. **Guess 3: throw**  
   - T(-), H(-), R(✓), O(-), W(-) → R fixed at position 3; T/H/O/W present but not positions 1/2/4/5 respectively.

### Key Insights:
- **Secret word structure**: `_ _ R _ _` (R confirmed at position 3).
- **Present letters**: T, H, O, W (all must appear).
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E, S, P (cannot be used).
- **Position constraints**:

  - **H**: Not position 2 (from throw) → must be position 1, 4, or 5.
  - **O**: Not position 3 (from sport) or 4 (from throw) → must be position 1, 2, or 5.
  - **W**: Not position 5 (from throw) → must be position 1, 2, or 4.
- **Word must be composed of**: T, H, O, W, R.

### Deduction:
- **Position 5**: Only H or O can be here (since T and W are forbidden at position 5, and only H/O remain as options for position 5).
  - **If position 5 is O**: Positions 1/2/4 for T/H/W lead to invalid words (e.g., ""HTRWO"" or ""WTRHO"" are not valid English words).
  - **If position 5 is H**: Positions 1/2/4 for T/O/W yield:
    - Option: Position 1 = W, Position 2 = O, Position 4 = T → Forms ""WORTH"".
- **Validation**:
  - WORTH = W(1), O(2), R(3), T(4), H(5).
  - Satisfies constraints:
    - T not position 1 or 5 → at position 4 ✅.
    - H not position 2 → at position 5 ✅.
    - O not position 3 or 4 → at position 2 ✅.
    - W not position 5 → at position 1 ✅.
  - Uses required letters: T, H, O, W, R.
  - Avoids absent letters.

Given ""WORTH"" fits all feedback and constraints, it is the most probable solution.",Guess 4: worth -> FEEDBACK: W(✓) O(✓) R(✓) T(✓) H(✓),SUCCESS
