We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
C: x (not in the word)
R: - (in the word but wrong position)
A: - (in the word but wrong position)
N: x (not in the word)
E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters R and A, but not in the positions they were in ""CRANE"". Specifically, R is not the second letter, and A is not the third letter.
- The letters C, N, and E are not in the word at all.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
1. Includes R and A (since they are in the secret word) but in different positions than in ""CRANE"".
2. Avoids using C, N, E (since they are absent).
3. Uses other common letters to test for their presence.

In ""CRANE"", R was in position 2 and A in position 3. So in the new guess, we should put R and A in positions that are not 2 and 3.

We also know that the secret word has 5 letters and we have 6 tries.

Let's think of words that have R and A, and avoid C, N, E.

Possible positions for R: it cannot be in position 2. So it can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.
Similarly, A cannot be in position 3, so it can be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We also want to test other common letters. Since we have only two known letters (R and A), we need to test more.

Common consonants: S, T, L, D, M, etc.
Vowels: we know A is present, but we don't know about others (O, I, U, etc.). However, we know E is absent, so we avoid E.

Let's try to form a word that has R and A, and also includes other common letters.

One idea: put R in position 1 and A in position 4? But we don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has R and A and also introduces new letters.

Let me list some words that have R and A, without C, N, E.

For example:
- ""PARTY"": P, A, R, T, Y -> but A is in position 2? In ""PARTY"": P(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), Y(5). 
  However, in our first guess, A was in position 3 and now we are putting A in position 2. That's allowed because the feedback only said A is in the word but not in position 3. Similarly, R was in position 2 in the first guess, and now we are putting R in position 3. That's also allowed.

But note: the feedback for R was that it is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put R in position 3, that might be correct or not. Similarly for A.

Another word: ""ROAST"" -> R(1), O(2), A(3), S(4), T(5). But in the first guess, A was in position 3 and we got a '-' meaning A is not in position 3. So if we put A in position 3 again, that would be a waste because we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting A in position 3 and R in position 2.

Therefore, in ""ROAST"", A is in position 3 again -> not good.

Similarly, we should avoid putting R in position 2.

So for ""PARTY"":
- A is in position 2 (which is new, not position 3) -> okay
- R is in position 3 (which is new, not position 2) -> okay

But we also have to consider that we are introducing P, T, Y.

Another word: ""TRAIL"" -> T(1), R(2), A(3), I(4), L(5). 
But here R is in position 2 again? We know R is not in position 2, so we should avoid putting R in position 2. Also, A is in position 3 again -> avoid.

So we need a word where R is not in position 2 and A is not in position 3.

Let me think of words with R and A, and the positions are different.

Some options:
- ""RADIO"": R(1), A(2), D(3), I(4), O(5) -> A is in 2 (not 3), R is in 1 (not 2). Also, avoids C, N, E.
- ""RAPID"": R(1), A(2), P(3), I(4), D(5) -> same as above, A in 2, R in 1.
- ""BARMY"": B(1), A(2), R(3), M(4), Y(5) -> A in 2, R in 3 (which is not 2, so okay for R; and A not in 3, so okay).

But note: we don't know if the word has B, D, I, O, P, etc.

Another idea: we can try to use a word that has the R and A in positions that we think might be correct, but we don't have enough information.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has many common letters and also repositions R and A.

I think ""RADIO"" is a good candidate because:
- It has R in position 1 (which we haven't tried) and A in position 2 (which we haven't tried for A, but note in the first guess A was in position 3).
- It introduces three new common letters: D, I, O.

Similarly, ""RAPID"" is also good.

But let me check if there are better words.

Another common starting word is ""SALET"", but it has E which is absent, so we cannot use that.

""TARES"": T(1), A(2), R(3), E(4), S(5) -> but E is absent, so we cannot use E.

We must avoid E.

So ""RADIO"" seems good.

But note: we are not sure if the secret word has R in position 1 or A in position 2. We are just testing.

Another word: ""PARKS"": P(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), S(5) -> A in 2, R in 3 (both new positions). And it avoids C, N, E.

But ""RADIO"" has the advantage of having two vowels (A and I, O) which might be helpful.

However, we don't know if the word has vowels other than A. Since E is out, we have A, I, O, U as possible.

I think ""RADIO"" is a solid choice.

But let me see if we can cover more common letters. The letters we haven't tried yet: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We have tried: C, R, A, N, E (and we know C, N, E are absent).

So we have R and A present.

In ""RADIO"", we are testing R, A, D, I, O.

Alternatively, we could use a word with S and T, which are very common.

For example: ""STARK"" -> S(1), T(2), A(3), R(4), K(5). But A is in position 3 again? We know A is not in position 3, so we cannot put A in position 3. So that's invalid.

""ARTSY"": A(1), R(2), T(3), S(4), Y(5). But R is in position 2? We know R is not in position 2, so we cannot put R in position 2. So invalid.

""TRIAD"": T(1), R(2), I(3), A(4), D(5). Again, R is in position 2 -> invalid.

So we must avoid position 2 for R and position 3 for A.

Let me try to find words with R and A, and without E, C, N, and with R not in 2 and A not in 3.

Another word: ""DRAWL"": D(1), R(2), A(3), W(4), L(5). Here R is in 2 and A in 3 -> invalid.

""FLAIR"": F(1), L(2), A(3), I(4), R(5). A is in 3 -> invalid.

""MANOR"": M(1), A(2), N(3), O(4), R(5). But N is absent, so we cannot use N. We know N is not in the word.

So we must avoid N.

Therefore, ""MANOR"" is invalid because of N.

""ROBOT"": R(1), O(2), B(3), O(4), T(5). But it doesn't have A? We know A is in the word, so we should include A to get more information about its position.

We know A is in the word, so we should include A in the guess to find its position.

Similarly for R.

So we must include both R and A.

After some thought, ""RADIO"" seems to fit:
- R in position 1 (not 2)
- A in position 2 (not 3)
- D, I, O are new letters.

Another option: ""RAPID"" (R1, A2, P3, I4, D5) - same idea.

But ""RADIO"" has the letter O which is a vowel, and we don't know if the word has O.

I think either is fine.

I'll go with ""RADIO"".

So the second guess is ""RADIO"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, N, and E are not in the secret word (marked with x).
- R and A are in the secret word but not in the positions they were guessed (R was position 2, A was position 3).

For the second guess:
- Must include R and A, but avoid positions 2 for R and 3 for A.
- Must exclude C, N, and E.
- Should introduce new common letters to gather more information.

The word ""RADIO"" fits these criteria:
- R is in position 1 (not 2).
- A is in position 2 (not 3).
- New letters tested: D, I, O (all common and not yet evaluated).
- Avoids C, N, E.

This guess will help narrow down the positions of R and A while testing three new letters.

C: x (not in the word)
R: - (in the word but wrong position)

Similarly, we should avoid putting R in position 2.

- A is in position 2 (which is new, not position 3) -> okay
- R is in position 3 (which is new, not position 2) -> okay

- Avoid repeating letters to cover more ground

Based on common Wordle strategies, I'll choose ""CRANE"". This word:
- Uses five distinct letters
- Contains three common consonants (C, R, N) and two important vowels (A, E)
- Frequently appears in recommended starting word lists
- Helps efficiently narrow down possibilities regardless of the feedback

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
C: x (not in the word)
R: - (in the word but wrong position)
A: - (in the word but wrong position)
N: x (not in the word)
E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters R and A, but not in the positions they were in ""CRANE"". Specifically, R is not the second letter, and A is not the third letter.
- The letters C, N, and E are not in the word at all.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
1. Includes R and A (since they are in the secret word) but in different positions than in ""CRANE"".
2. Avoids using C, N, E (since they are absent).
3. Uses other common letters to test for their presence.

In ""CRANE"", R was in position 2 and A in position 3. So in the new guess, we should put R and A in positions that are not 2 and 3.

We also know that the secret word has 5 letters and we have 6 tries.

Let's think of words that have R and A, and avoid C, N, E.

Possible positions for R: it cannot be in position 2. So it can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.
Similarly, A cannot be in position 3, so it can be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We also want to test other common letters. Since we have only two known letters (R and A), we need to test more.

Common consonants: S, T, L, D, M, etc.
Vowels: we know A is present, but we don't know about others (O, I, U, etc.). However, we know E is absent, so we avoid E.

Let's try to form a word that has R and A, and also includes other common letters.

One idea: put R in position 1 and A in position 4? But we don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has R and A and also introduces new letters.

Let me list some words that have R and A, without C, N, E.

For example:
- ""PARTY"": P, A, R, T, Y -> but A is in position 2? In ""PARTY"": P(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), Y(5). 
  However, in our first guess, A was in position 3 and now we are putting A in position 2. That's allowed because the feedback only said A is in the word but not in position 3. Similarly, R was in position 2 in the first guess, and now we are putting R in position 3. That's also allowed.

But note: the feedback for R was that it is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put R in position 3, that might be correct or not. Similarly for A.

Another word: ""ROAST"" -> R(1), O(2), A(3), S(4), T(5). But in the first guess, A was in position 3 and we got a '-' meaning A is not in position 3. So if we put A in position 3 again, that would be a waste because we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting A in position 3 and R in position 2.

Therefore, in ""ROAST"", A is in position 3 again -> not good.

Similarly, we should avoid putting R in position 2.

So for ""PARTY"":
- A is in position 2 (which is new, not position 3) -> okay
- R is in position 3 (which is new, not position 2) -> okay

But we also have to consider that we are introducing P, T, Y.

Another word: ""TRAIL"" -> T(1), R(2), A(3), I(4), L(5). 
But here R is in position 2 again? We know R is not in position 2, so we should avoid putting R in position 2. Also, A is in position 3 again -> avoid.

So we need a word where R is not in position 2 and A is not in position 3.

Let me think of words with R and A, and the positions are different.

Some options:
- ""RADIO"": R(1), A(2), D(3), I(4), O(5) -> A is in 2 (not 3), R is in 1 (not 2). Also, avoids C, N, E.
- ""RAPID"": R(1), A(2), P(3), I(4), D(5) -> same as above, A in 2, R in 1.
- ""BARMY"": B(1), A(2), R(3), M(4), Y(5) -> A in 2, R in 3 (which is not 2, so okay for R; and A not in 3, so okay).

But note: we don't know if the word has B, D, I, O, P, etc.

Another idea: we can try to use a word that has the R and A in positions that we think might be correct, but we don't have enough information.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has many common letters and also repositions R and A.

I think ""RADIO"" is a good candidate because:
- It has R in position 1 (which we haven't tried) and A in position 2 (which we haven't tried for A, but note in the first guess A was in position 3).
- It introduces three new common letters: D, I, O.

Similarly, ""RAPID"" is also good.

But let me check if there are better words.

Another common starting word is ""SALET"", but it has E which is absent, so we cannot use that.

""TARES"": T(1), A(2), R(3), E(4), S(5) -> but E is absent, so we cannot use E.

We must avoid E.

So ""RADIO"" seems good.

But note: we are not sure if the secret word has R in position 1 or A in position 2. We are just testing.

Another word: ""PARKS"": P(1), A(2), R(3), K(4), S(5) -> A in 2, R in 3 (both new positions). And it avoids C, N, E.

But ""RADIO"" has the advantage of having two vowels (A and I, O) which might be helpful.

However, we don't know if the word has vowels other than A. Since E is out, we have A, I, O, U as possible.

I think ""RADIO"" is a solid choice.

But let me see if we can cover more common letters. The letters we haven't tried yet: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We have tried: C, R, A, N, E (and we know C, N, E are absent).

So we have R and A present.

In ""RADIO"", we are testing R, A, D, I, O.

Alternatively, we could use a word with S and T, which are very common.

For example: ""STARK"" -> S(1), T(2), A(3), R(4), K(5). But A is in position 3 again? We know A is not in position 3, so we cannot put A in position 3. So that's invalid.

""ARTSY"": A(1), R(2), T(3), S(4), Y(5). But R is in position 2? We know R is not in position 2, so we cannot put R in position 2. So invalid.

""TRIAD"": T(1), R(2), I(3), A(4), D(5). Again, R is in position 2 -> invalid.

So we must avoid position 2 for R and position 3 for A.

Let me try to find words with R and A, and without E, C, N, and with R not in 2 and A not in 3.

Another word: ""DRAWL"": D(1), R(2), A(3), W(4), L(5). Here R is in 2 and A in 3 -> invalid.

""FLAIR"": F(1), L(2), A(3), I(4), R(5). A is in 3 -> invalid.

""MANOR"": M(1), A(2), N(3), O(4), R(5). But N is absent, so we cannot use N. We know N is not in the word.

So we must avoid N.

Therefore, ""MANOR"" is invalid because of N.

""ROBOT"": R(1), O(2), B(3), O(4), T(5). But it doesn't have A? We know A is in the word, so we should include A to get more information about its position.

We know A is in the word, so we should include A in the guess to find its position.

Similarly for R.

So we must include both R and A.

After some thought, ""RADIO"" seems to fit:
- R in position 1 (not 2)
- A in position 2 (not 3)
- D, I, O are new letters.

Another option: ""RAPID"" (R1, A2, P3, I4, D5) - same idea.

But ""RADIO"" has the letter O which is a vowel, and we don't know if the word has O.

I think either is fine.

I'll go with ""RADIO"".

So the second guess is ""RADIO"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, N, and E are not in the secret word (marked with x).
- R and A are in the secret word but not in the positions they were guessed (R was position 2, A was position 3).

For the second guess:
- Must include R and A, but avoid positions 2 for R and 3 for A.
- Must exclude C, N, and E.
- Should introduce new common letters to gather more information.

The word ""RADIO"" fits these criteria:
- R is in position 1 (not 2).
- A is in position 2 (not 3).
- New letters tested: D, I, O (all common and not yet evaluated).
- Avoids C, N, E.

This guess will help narrow down the positions of R and A while testing three new letters.

We have two sets of feedback:
1. From ""CRANE"": 
   - C (x), R (-), A (-), N (x), E (x)
   Meaning: R and A are in the secret word, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively. C, N, E are absent.

2. From ""RADIO"":
   - R (✓), A (-), D (x), I (-), O (x)
   Meaning: R is correct and in position 1. A is in the word but not in position 2 (since we got '-'). D and O are absent. I is in the word but not in position 4.

So, summarizing what we know:
- Secret word has: R in position 1 (from RADIO feedback), A (somewhere, not position 2 or 3), and I (somewhere, but not position 4).
- Absent letters: C, E, N, D, O.
- Also, from CRANE, R was not in position 2 and A was not in position 3 – but now we know R is fixed in position 1.

Current state:
- Position 1: R (confirmed)
- Position 2: We tried A (from RADIO) but got '-', so A is not in position 2. Previously from CRANE, A is not in position 3. So A must be in position 4 or 5? (positions 1 is taken by R, so A can be in 4 or 5? Actually position 1 is R, so A can be in 4,5 since 2 and 3 are ruled out? Not necessarily – positions 4 and 5 are still possible, but also position 3 might be reconsidered? No – from CRANE, A was in position 3 and got '-', so A is not in position 3. Similarly, from RADIO, A is not in position 2. So A must be in position 4 or 5.

Similarly, I is present but not in position 4. And I can be in positions 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).

Now, we know the secret word starts with R, has A and I somewhere, and avoids C,E,N,D,O.

Available positions:
- Pos 1: R (fixed)
- Pos 2: must be a letter that is not A (since A not there) and we don't know yet. Also, we have to consider I could be here? But I could be in pos2,3,5.
- Pos 3: unknown, but A is not here (from CRANE) so not A. I could be here.
- Pos 4: not I (from RADIO feedback), and A could be here? Yes, or I can't? Wait: I is not in pos4, but A might be in pos4.
- Pos 5: A or I could be here.

Now, we need to form a word that satisfies:
- Starts with R.
- Contains A and I.
- A cannot be in pos2 (known) or pos3 (known). So A must be in pos4 or pos5.
- I cannot be in pos4 (known) so I in pos2,3, or5.
- But note: if A is in pos4, then I can't be in pos4 (already) and similarly if A is in pos5, I must be elsewhere.

Also, we have to avoid letters C,E,N,D,O.

Let me think of possible words.

First, the word must have R in pos1, and contain A and I.

We don't know if there are more letters.

Possible structure:

Option: A in pos4, then I could be in pos2,3, or5.
But also, we have to fill the other positions.

So, for example:
- R _ _ A _ : then I must be in pos2 or pos3 (since if in pos5, but then A and I occupy both? No, two places: pos2,3,5) but if A is in pos4, then positions 2,3,5 are open for I and the other letter? Actually, we need two more letters besides I? No: positions: 1=R, 4=A, then position 2,3,5 need to be filled, and one of them must be I, and the other two are new letters? But we have only A and I as known letters? The word must have exactly A and I? Not necessarily, there could be more letters? Actually, we only know about R, A, I so far? But the secret word is 5 letters, so there are two more letters which we haven't discovered yet.

So we need to include two new letters.

Similarly, if A is in pos5, then: R _ _ _ A, and I must be in pos2 or3? Also an option.

Now, given we have two possibilities for A: pos4 or pos5.

We also need to choose a word that tests as many new letters as possible.

Common letters to try: S, T, L, M, P, etc.

Avoiding absent letters: C,E,N,D,O.

Try to list possible words.

First, assume A is in pos4: then word: R ? ? A ?
Then I must be in one of: pos2, pos3, or pos5.

But if I is in pos2: R I ? A ?
If I in pos3: R ? I A ?
If I in pos5: R ? ? A I

Similarly, if A is in pos5: R ? ? ? A
Then I in pos2: R I ? ? A
I in pos3: R ? I ? A

We need to fill the blanks.

Also, remember we must use 5 distinct letters? No, words can have repeat letters? But in English 5-letter words, repeats are possible? But in this case, since we have R, A, I, and they are distinct, probably.

Now, let me try to form actual words.

First, try A in pos4: R ? ? A ?

Case 1: I in pos2 -> R I ? A ?

Then the word has R, I, and A, with pos3 and pos5 to fill.

Possible letters: avoid C,E,N,D,O.

For example: R I A A ? -> but two A's? Possible? But we guessed A in pos4, so pos3 could be another letter? But word ""RITAL""? No, R I T A L -> but T and L allowed.

RITAL is not a word. Let's think of real words.

Examples: R I V A L? R I V A L -> positions: R(1), I(2), V(3), A(4), L(5). Then the word is RIVAL. But does it contain I? Yes in pos2. We don't have trial for other letters? Also, we haven't tested V and L.

But we must avoid D,O? V and L are not banned, so okay.

Another: R I S A L? Not a word? R I S K A? No. R I S K S, not.

R I L A R? Repeat R? Not likely.

Common words: R I V A L, R I D A L? RIDAL? Not a word.

PRINT? But P absent? No, at start? P allowed? Yes.

But word: R I P A L? Not a word.

R I C A L? But C absent? No, C is banned? C is not in word? We cannot use C? Actually, C is absent, so we can use letters? We are building the word, but C,E,N,D,O are banned? So avoid those letters. So for pos3 and pos5, we cannot use C,E,N,D,O.

So in R I ? A ? , with ?3 and ?5 not C,E,N,D,O.

Possible: ?3 could be F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? But Q,X,Y,Z less common.

Let's try S or T.

R I S A A? Not word.

R I S A P? Not word.

R I T A L? But T and L: ""RITAL"" not English word.

R I P E R? But E banned? Cannot.

Hmm, perhaps RIVAL is an option: R(1), I(2), V(3), A(4), L(5). And V and L not excluded? We don't know yet. And we haven't tested V and L.

Similarly, other words: R I F L A? But A in pos5? Then this case is A in pos4? R I F L A? Not R I ? A ? , if A in pos4, then fifth? L in fifth? So R I F A L? Not a word.

Another idea: Try R I B A L? RIBAL not common? Not standard.

R I G A L? RIGAL? Not word.

Perhaps R I M A L? RIMAL? Not word.

So RIVAL? Let's consider it for now.

If I in pos5: R ? ? A I, but then ?2 and ?3 to fill.

For example: R U M A I -> RUMAL? No. R B I A S? But no, A in pos4? R B ? A I -> RBASI? No.

R S T A I? RSTA? Not word. RUSTA? Not.

Not many words for R ? ? A I.

Common? Maybe ""REPAI"" but E is banned? Also E absent. So hard.

Now, case I in pos3: R ? I A ?

For example: R U I A A? Not. Words: R U I N A? But N banned? N absent? Cannot. So avoid N.

R G I A ? ?5? R GI A S? RGIA? Not. RABIN? But N banned? And positions: R A B I N? A in pos2, but we know A not in pos2? From RADIO, A not in pos2? So if we put RABIN, A is in pos2, which we know is wrong? So we cannot. Because A must not be in pos2? So when I in pos3 and A in pos4: R ? I A ?

?2 cannot be A? And ?2 must be letter not banned.

Possible: R B I A S? RBAS? Not word. R C I A T? C banned. RC not allowed.

R H I A L? RHIAL? Not word. R P I A L? RPIAL? No. R T I A L? RTIAL? Not word? “RITUAL”? No, RTIAL not.

“ROYAL”? But O banned? And Y? ROYAL has O? O absent? Cannot.

So few options? 

Perhaps consider A in pos5? 

Second possibility: A in pos5: R ? ? ? A

Then I must be in pos2,3, or4? But from RADIO, I cannot be in pos4? Since I is marked (-) meaning in wrong position? So I is not in pos4.

So I must be in pos2 or pos3? 

Case: I in pos2: R I ? ? A

Now, positions: R(1), I(2), ?3, ?4, A(5)

Then ?3 and ?4 to fill, avoiding banned letters.

Possible words: 
R I V A L? But A is supposed to be pos5? RIVAL would be R(1), I(2), V(3), A(4), L(5) — that’s A in pos4, but we are considering A in pos5 now? So RIVAL has A in pos4.

For A in pos5: R I ? ? A

So ?3 and ?4 unknown.

For example: R I S K A? RISK A? RISKA not a word. R I F T Y? RIFTY not. R I B B A? Not. R I L L A? RILLA — papar rilla? Not common word. R I P P A? Not.

Common: R I T Z A? RITZA? No. RITUAL? But U and L? But let’s see: R I T U A L? That’s 6 letters? No, too long.

5-letter: R I T E O? E and O banned? Not. 

Perhaps “RIPEN”? But E banned? Not.

“RIVAL” is with A in pos4.

“RIDER”? But D banned? And E, E banned? D banned? We cannot use D? Yes, D is absent? From RADIO feedback, D(x), so absent.

So D banned.

Difficult: try R I S H A? RISH A? Not English.

R I V E R? E banned? Not.

Perhaps look for words ending with A.

Common: words like ""PIZZA"" not start with R? Or ""CINEMA"" long? ""ROAST"" O banned.

With R I ... A: ?

""RIGID"" G,I,D but D banned? And A not at end.

Another: ""RIMAu"" no.

Perhaps R I C H A? But C banned? Not.

R I L I A? Not.

Maybe RIPA? Too short.

Not finding? Perhaps I in pos3.

Then: R ? I ? A

?2 and ?4 to fill.

Word: R O I S T? O banned? No. R U I N A? N banned? Not.

R M I L K? M,I,L,K — but A at end? No, A must be last? Not necessarily, A is in 5th? So R ? I ? A

For example: R B I T A? RBITA not? R G A I N? But G A I N: A in pos3? But we thought A not in pos3? From CRANE, A not in pos3? But here A is in pos3? That would be conflicting? No: R G A I N — positions: R(1), G(2), A(3), I(4), N(5). But we know from CRANE: A is not in pos3, so this word invalid? Because if secret word has A in pos3, but first guess CRANE had A in pos3 and got '-', meaning not correct position b but in the word? So A cannot be in pos3? Therefore, we cannot have a word with A in pos3, so R ? I ? A cannot have A in pos3; ?3 can be I? No, I is in pos3? In this case: I in pos3, so position 3 is I, then ?4 is another letter, then A in pos5.

So word: R ? I ? A, so positions: 1=R, 2=?, 3=I, 4=?, 5=A.

So find an English word R ? I ? A.

Possible: 
R O I S A? Not? ""ROISTA"" not word.
R A I S A? Not.
R U I N S? But not A at end? Has S at end? But we have A in pos5? Must be A.

R ? I ? A 

Common words: ""URBAN"" not start with R? Perhaps ""RABIN"" but N banned? And A not in pos5? RABIN: R(1), A(2), B(3), I(4), N(5) — but A not in pos2? From RADIO, A not in pos2? So invalid.

Only option with R ? I ? A: let's think ""RADII"" but I at end? R A D I I? But D banned? And A in pos2? A cannot be in os2.

R T I M A? RTIMA not word? ""ARTIMA"" no.

Perhaps ""RUTIN"" N banned? Not.

Another idea: ""ROBIN"" but O banned N banned? Not.

So it seems difficult to find words with A in pos5 and I in pos3?

Perhaps A in pos4.

Back to that: R ? ? A ?

With I in one of pos2,3,5.

And avoiding banned letters.

Previously, RIVAL: R(1), I(2), V(3), A(4), L(5)? But that's A in pos4, which is allowed? From CRANE, pos3 was not A? In CRANE, A was in pos3 and got '-', meaning A not in pos3, but pos4 is different.

In this, A in pos4 is different.

And positions: I in pos2? In RADIO, we had not tested pos2 for I? We tested I in pos4 and found not there? So I could be in pos2? Yes.

And RIVAL is an English word? Yes, RIVAL.

Lever v or something? RIVAL is valid.

Also, V and L not banned.

So this seems a good candidate: it has I in position 2, which we haven't tested, and A in position 4, which is new, and V and L new.

But we don't know if they are in the word? We are testing.

Perhaps there is a better word? That covers more common letters?

Another word: R S T A P?  R S T A P not word? Or R U S T A? But not A in pos4? R U S T A would be positions: R(1), U(2), S(3), T(4), A(5)? A in pos5.

Then I is missing? We must include I? No, the secret word has I? From RADIO fb, I(-) so I is in the word.

So if we guess a word without I, it would be wrong? But we are required to guess valid English words, but if we miss I, we might get feedback that includes which letters, but we know I is present, so to get the we must include I in our guess? Or not necessary? Because we can guess any valid word? But to be efficient, we should include the known letters to locate their positions.

Yes, we know that R, A, I are in the word, so we must include them? Unless we are trying to find other letters? But here, since we only have 6 guesses, and we know 3 letters, it's better to include them to pinpoint positions.

Therefore, RIVAL includes R, I, A — all three: R at 1, I at 2, A at 4? And V and L additional.

But is there a better word?

R I S A P? Not word or A in pos4? R I S A P? Not 5.

Another word with A in pos4 and I in pos5? Like R ? ? A I

R U M A I? Not word. R H A I ? Not position.

R O L A I? O banned? Not.

So RIVAL seems good.

Alternatively, what about R A P I D? But D banned? And A in pos2? But we know A not in pos2? From RADIO, feedback A(-) means not in pos2, so if we put A in pos2, it would be invalid because we know it's not there, so we must avoid putting A in pos2 or pos3.

Similarly for I not in pos4.

So R A P I D has A in pos2? No? R(1), A(2), P(3), I(4), D(5)? Exactly A in pos2, which is forbidden? So cannot guess that.

Other word: ""ROBIN"" O banned and N banned? Not.

So RIVAL is a valid word: R in1, I in2, V in3, A in4, L in5.

And letters V and L are not tested yet? New.

So good to test.

But could be other words.

Another possibility: ""RISKY"" but K and Y, but where is A? Not included? Must include A and I? So not.

So I think RIVAL is a good choice.

But wait, in RADIO, we had R in1 (correct), A in2 (wrong position), so A not in2, and in RIVAL, A is in4.

Similarly, I in RADIO was in4 (wrong position), and in RIVAL, I is in2.

Also, from CRANE, A was in3 (wrong position), now in4.

So we're testing new positions.

Therefore, second guess is RIVAL.

But let's confirm: the word is RIVAL.

<guess>RIVAL</guess>
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:
- Guess 1 (CRANE): R and A are present, but not in positions 2 and 3, respectively. C, N, E are absent.
- Guess 2 (RADIO): R is correct in position 1. A is present but not in position 2. I is present but not in position 4. D and O are absent.

Key insights:
- Position 1 must be R (fixed).
- A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from both guesses), so it must be in position 4 or 5.
- I cannot be in position 4 (from RADIO feedback), so it must be in position 2, 3, or 5.
- Absent letters: C, E, N, D, O.
- The secret word contains R, A, and I, with two additional unknown letters.

For the next guess:
- Must start with R.
- Must include A and I in positions not ruled out.
- Should test new common letters (like S, T, L, V, etc.) to narrow down possibilities.
- Avoid using C, E, N, D, O.

Choosing ""RIVAL"":
- R in position 1 (confirmed correct).
- I in position 2 (tests a new position for I; feedback will reveal if correct or new position).
- V in position 3 (new letter test).
- A in position 4 (tests a possible position for A; not previously tested positions 4 or 5).
- L in position 5 (new letter test).
- Word is valid and avoids banned letters.

This guess efficiently tests the positions of A and I, while introducing new potential letters (V and L) to accelerate the search.

<guess>RIVAL</guess>",RIVAL,"We have two sets of feedback:
1. From ""CRANE"": 
   - C (x), R (-), A (-), N (x), E (x)
   Meaning: R and A are in the secret word, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively. C, N, E are absent.

2. From ""RADIO"":
   - R (✓), A (-), D (x), I (-), O (x)
   Meaning: R is correct and in position 1. A is in the word but not in position 2 (since we got '-'). D and O are absent. I is in the word but not in position 4.

So, summarizing what we know:
- Secret word has: R in position 1 (from RADIO feedback), A (somewhere, not position 2 or 3), and I (somewhere, but not position 4).
- Absent letters: C, E, N, D, O.
- Also, from CRANE, R was not in position 2 and A was not in position 3 – but now we know R is fixed in position 1.

Current state:
- Position 1: R (confirmed)
- Position 2: We tried A (from RADIO) but got '-', so A is not in position 2. Previously from CRANE, A is not in position 3. So A must be in position 4 or 5? (positions 1 is taken by R, so A can be in 4 or 5? Actually position 1 is R, so A can be in 4,5 since 2 and 3 are ruled out? Not necessarily – positions 4 and 5 are still possible, but also position 3 might be reconsidered? No – from CRANE, A was in position 3 and got '-', so A is not in position 3. Similarly, from RADIO, A is not in position 2. So A must be in position 4 or 5.

Similarly, I is present but not in position 4. And I can be in positions 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).

Now, we know the secret word starts with R, has A and I somewhere, and avoids C,E,N,D,O.

Available positions:
- Pos 1: R (fixed)
- Pos 2: must be a letter that is not A (since A not there) and we don't know yet. Also, we have to consider I could be here? But I could be in pos2,3,5.
- Pos 3: unknown, but A is not here (from CRANE) so not A. I could be here.
- Pos 4: not I (from RADIO feedback), and A could be here? Yes, or I can't? Wait: I is not in pos4, but A might be in pos4.
- Pos 5: A or I could be here.

Now, we need to form a word that satisfies:
- Starts with R.
- Contains A and I.
- A cannot be in pos2 (known) or pos3 (known). So A must be in pos4 or pos5.
- I cannot be in pos4 (known) so I in pos2,3, or5.
- But note: if A is in pos4, then I can't be in pos4 (already) and similarly if A is in pos5, I must be elsewhere.

Also, we have to avoid letters C,E,N,D,O.

Let me think of possible words.

First, the word must have R in pos1, and contain A and I.

We don't know if there are more letters.

Possible structure:

Option: A in pos4, then I could be in pos2,3, or5.
But also, we have to fill the other positions.

So, for example:
- R _ _ A _ : then I must be in pos2 or pos3 (since if in pos5, but then A and I occupy both? No, two places: pos2,3,5) but if A is in pos4, then positions 2,3,5 are open for I and the other letter? Actually, we need two more letters besides I? No: positions: 1=R, 4=A, then position 2,3,5 need to be filled, and one of them must be I, and the other two are new letters? But we have only A and I as known letters? The word must have exactly A and I? Not necessarily, there could be more letters? Actually, we only know about R, A, I so far? But the secret word is 5 letters, so there are two more letters which we haven't discovered yet.

So we need to include two new letters.

Similarly, if A is in pos5, then: R _ _ _ A, and I must be in pos2 or3? Also an option.

Now, given we have two possibilities for A: pos4 or pos5.

We also need to choose a word that tests as many new letters as possible.

Common letters to try: S, T, L, M, P, etc.

Avoiding absent letters: C,E,N,D,O.

Try to list possible words.

First, assume A is in pos4: then word: R ? ? A ?
Then I must be in one of: pos2, pos3, or pos5.

But if I is in pos2: R I ? A ?
If I in pos3: R ? I A ?
If I in pos5: R ? ? A I

Similarly, if A is in pos5: R ? ? ? A
Then I in pos2: R I ? ? A
I in pos3: R ? I ? A

We need to fill the blanks.

Also, remember we must use 5 distinct letters? No, words can have repeat letters? But in English 5-letter words, repeats are possible? But in this case, since we have R, A, I, and they are distinct, probably.

Now, let me try to form actual words.

First, try A in pos4: R ? ? A ?

Case 1: I in pos2 -> R I ? A ?

Then the word has R, I, and A, with pos3 and pos5 to fill.

Possible letters: avoid C,E,N,D,O.

For example: R I A A ? -> but two A's? Possible? But we guessed A in pos4, so pos3 could be another letter? But word ""RITAL""? No, R I T A L -> but T and L allowed.

RITAL is not a word. Let's think of real words.

Examples: R I V A L? R I V A L -> positions: R(1), I(2), V(3), A(4), L(5). Then the word is RIVAL. But does it contain I? Yes in pos2. We don't have trial for other letters? Also, we haven't tested V and L.

But we must avoid D,O? V and L are not banned, so okay.

Another: R I S A L? Not a word? R I S K A? No. R I S K S, not.

R I L A R? Repeat R? Not likely.

Common words: R I V A L, R I D A L? RIDAL? Not a word.

PRINT? But P absent? No, at start? P allowed? Yes.

But word: R I P A L? Not a word.

R I C A L? But C absent? No, C is banned? C is not in word? We cannot use C? Actually, C is absent, so we can use letters? We are building the word, but C,E,N,D,O are banned? So avoid those letters. So for pos3 and pos5, we cannot use C,E,N,D,O.

So in R I ? A ? , with ?3 and ?5 not C,E,N,D,O.

Possible: ?3 could be F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? But Q,X,Y,Z less common.

Let's try S or T.

R I S A A? Not word.

R I S A P? Not word.

R I T A L? But T and L: ""RITAL"" not English word.

R I P E R? But E banned? Cannot.

Hmm, perhaps RIVAL is an option: R(1), I(2), V(3), A(4), L(5). And V and L not excluded? We don't know yet. And we haven't tested V and L.

Similarly, other words: R I F L A? But A in pos5? Then this case is A in pos4? R I F L A? Not R I ? A ? , if A in pos4, then fifth? L in fifth? So R I F A L? Not a word.

Another idea: Try R I B A L? RIBAL not common? Not standard.

R I G A L? RIGAL? Not word.

Perhaps R I M A L? RIMAL? Not word.

So RIVAL? Let's consider it for now.

If I in pos5: R ? ? A I, but then ?2 and ?3 to fill.

For example: R U M A I -> RUMAL? No. R B I A S? But no, A in pos4? R B ? A I -> RBASI? No.

R S T A I? RSTA? Not word. RUSTA? Not.

Not many words for R ? ? A I.

Common? Maybe ""REPAI"" but E is banned? Also E absent. So hard.

Now, case I in pos3: R ? I A ?

For example: R U I A A? Not. Words: R U I N A? But N banned? N absent? Cannot. So avoid N.

R G I A ? ?5? R GI A S? RGIA? Not. RABIN? But N banned? And positions: R A B I N? A in pos2, but we know A not in pos2? From RADIO, A not in pos2? So if we put RABIN, A is in pos2, which we know is wrong? So we cannot. Because A must not be in pos2? So when I in pos3 and A in pos4: R ? I A ?

?2 cannot be A? And ?2 must be letter not banned.

Possible: R B I A S? RBAS? Not word. R C I A T? C banned. RC not allowed.

R H I A L? RHIAL? Not word. R P I A L? RPIAL? No. R T I A L? RTIAL? Not word? “RITUAL”? No, RTIAL not.

“ROYAL”? But O banned? And Y? ROYAL has O? O absent? Cannot.

So few options? 

Perhaps consider A in pos5? 

Second possibility: A in pos5: R ? ? ? A

Then I must be in pos2,3, or4? But from RADIO, I cannot be in pos4? Since I is marked (-) meaning in wrong position? So I is not in pos4.

So I must be in pos2 or pos3? 

Case: I in pos2: R I ? ? A

Now, positions: R(1), I(2), ?3, ?4, A(5)

Then ?3 and ?4 to fill, avoiding banned letters.

Possible words: 
R I V A L? But A is supposed to be pos5? RIVAL would be R(1), I(2), V(3), A(4), L(5) — that’s A in pos4, but we are considering A in pos5 now? So RIVAL has A in pos4.

For A in pos5: R I ? ? A

So ?3 and ?4 unknown.

For example: R I S K A? RISK A? RISKA not a word. R I F T Y? RIFTY not. R I B B A? Not. R I L L A? RILLA — papar rilla? Not common word. R I P P A? Not.

Common: R I T Z A? RITZA? No. RITUAL? But U and L? But let’s see: R I T U A L? That’s 6 letters? No, too long.

5-letter: R I T E O? E and O banned? Not. 

Perhaps “RIPEN”? But E banned? Not.

“RIVAL” is with A in pos4.

“RIDER”? But D banned? And E, E banned? D banned? We cannot use D? Yes, D is absent? From RADIO feedback, D(x), so absent.

So D banned.

Difficult: try R I S H A? RISH A? Not English.

R I V E R? E banned? Not.

Perhaps look for words ending with A.

Common: words like ""PIZZA"" not start with R? Or ""CINEMA"" long? ""ROAST"" O banned.

With R I ... A: ?

""RIGID"" G,I,D but D banned? And A not at end.

Another: ""RIMAu"" no.

Perhaps R I C H A? But C banned? Not.

R I L I A? Not.

Maybe RIPA? Too short.

Not finding? Perhaps I in pos3.

Then: R ? I ? A

?2 and ?4 to fill.

Word: R O I S T? O banned? No. R U I N A? N banned? Not.

R M I L K? M,I,L,K — but A at end? No, A must be last? Not necessarily, A is in 5th? So R ? I ? A

For example: R B I T A? RBITA not? R G A I N? But G A I N: A in pos3? But we thought A not in pos3? From CRANE, A not in pos3? But here A is in pos3? That would be conflicting? No: R G A I N — positions: R(1), G(2), A(3), I(4), N(5). But we know from CRANE: A is not in pos3, so this word invalid? Because if secret word has A in pos3, but first guess CRANE had A in pos3 and got '-', meaning not correct position b but in the word? So A cannot be in pos3? Therefore, we cannot have a word with A in pos3, so R ? I ? A cannot have A in pos3; ?3 can be I? No, I is in pos3? In this case: I in pos3, so position 3 is I, then ?4 is another letter, then A in pos5.

So word: R ? I ? A, so positions: 1=R, 2=?, 3=I, 4=?, 5=A.

So find an English word R ? I ? A.

Possible: 
R O I S A? Not? ""ROISTA"" not word.
R A I S A? Not.
R U I N S? But not A at end? Has S at end? But we have A in pos5? Must be A.

R ? I ? A 

Common words: ""URBAN"" not start with R? Perhaps ""RABIN"" but N banned? And A not in pos5? RABIN: R(1), A(2), B(3), I(4), N(5) — but A not in pos2? From RADIO, A not in pos2? So invalid.

Only option with R ? I ? A: let's think ""RADII"" but I at end? R A D I I? But D banned? And A in pos2? A cannot be in os2.

R T I M A? RTIMA not word? ""ARTIMA"" no.

Perhaps ""RUTIN"" N banned? Not.

Another idea: ""ROBIN"" but O banned N banned? Not.

So it seems difficult to find words with A in pos5 and I in pos3?

Perhaps A in pos4.

Back to that: R ? ? A ?

With I in one of pos2,3,5.

And avoiding banned letters.

Previously, RIVAL: R(1), I(2), V(3), A(4), L(5)? But that's A in pos4, which is allowed? From CRANE, pos3 was not A? In CRANE, A was in pos3 and got '-', meaning A not in pos3, but pos4 is different.

In this, A in pos4 is different.

And positions: I in pos2? In RADIO, we had not tested pos2 for I? We tested I in pos4 and found not there? So I could be in pos2? Yes.

And RIVAL is an English word? Yes, RIVAL.

Lever v or something? RIVAL is valid.

Also, V and L not banned.

So this seems a good candidate: it has I in position 2, which we haven't tested, and A in position 4, which is new, and V and L new.

But we don't know if they are in the word? We are testing.

Perhaps there is a better word? That covers more common letters?

Another word: R S T A P?  R S T A P not word? Or R U S T A? But not A in pos4? R U S T A would be positions: R(1), U(2), S(3), T(4), A(5)? A in pos5.

Then I is missing? We must include I? No, the secret word has I? From RADIO fb, I(-) so I is in the word.

So if we guess a word without I, it would be wrong? But we are required to guess valid English words, but if we miss I, we might get feedback that includes which letters, but we know I is present, so to get the we must include I in our guess? Or not necessary? Because we can guess any valid word? But to be efficient, we should include the known letters to locate their positions.

Yes, we know that R, A, I are in the word, so we must include them? Unless we are trying to find other letters? But here, since we only have 6 guesses, and we know 3 letters, it's better to include them to pinpoint positions.

Therefore, RIVAL includes R, I, A — all three: R at 1, I at 2, A at 4? And V and L additional.

But is there a better word?

R I S A P? Not word or A in pos4? R I S A P? Not 5.

Another word with A in pos4 and I in pos5? Like R ? ? A I

R U M A I? Not word. R H A I ? Not position.

R O L A I? O banned? Not.

So RIVAL seems good.

Alternatively, what about R A P I D? But D banned? And A in pos2? But we know A not in pos2? From RADIO, feedback A(-) means not in pos2, so if we put A in pos2, it would be invalid because we know it's not there, so we must avoid putting A in pos2 or pos3.

Similarly for I not in pos4.

So R A P I D has A in pos2? No? R(1), A(2), P(3), I(4), D(5)? Exactly A in pos2, which is forbidden? So cannot guess that.

Other word: ""ROBIN"" O banned and N banned? Not.

So RIVAL is a valid word: R in1, I in2, V in3, A in4, L in5.

And letters V and L are not tested yet? New.

So good to test.

But could be other words.

Another possibility: ""RISKY"" but K and Y, but where is A? Not included? Must include A and I? So not.

So I think RIVAL is a good choice.

But wait, in RADIO, we had R in1 (correct), A in2 (wrong position), so A not in2, and in RIVAL, A is in4.

Similarly, I in RADIO was in4 (wrong position), and in RIVAL, I is in2.

Also, from CRANE, A was in3 (wrong position), now in4.

So we're testing new positions.

Therefore, second guess is RIVAL.

But let's confirm: the word is RIVAL.

<guess>RIVAL</guess>Based on the previous feedback:
- Guess 1 (CRANE): R and A are present, but not in positions 2 and 3, respectively. C, N, E are absent.
- Guess 2 (RADIO): R is correct in position 1. A is present but not in position 2. I is present but not in position 4. D and O are absent.

Key insights:
- Position 1 must be R (fixed).
- A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from both guesses), so it must be in position 4 or 5.
- I cannot be in position 4 (from RADIO feedback), so it must be in position 2, 3, or 5.
- Absent letters: C, E, N, D, O.
- The secret word contains R, A, and I, with two additional unknown letters.

For the next guess:
- Must start with R.
- Must include A and I in positions not ruled out.
- Should test new common letters (like S, T, L, V, etc.) to narrow down possibilities.
- Avoid using C, E, N, D, O.

Choosing ""RIVAL"":
- R in position 1 (confirmed correct).
- I in position 2 (tests a new position for I; feedback will reveal if correct or new position).
- V in position 3 (new letter test).
- A in position 4 (tests a possible position for A; not previously tested positions 4 or 5).
- L in position 5 (new letter test).
- Word is valid and avoids banned letters.

This guess efficiently tests the positions of A and I, while introducing new potential letters (V and L) to accelerate the search.",Guess 3: RIVAL -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) I(✓) V(✓) A(✓) L(✓),SUCCESS
