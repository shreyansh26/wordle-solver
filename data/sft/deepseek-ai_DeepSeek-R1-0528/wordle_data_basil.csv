I'm starting my first guess in this Wordle-like game. I have to guess a 5-letter English word, and I'll get feedback on how close it is to the secret word. Since it's my first try, I want a word that uses common letters to maximize the information I get.

Common vowels and consonants are good for initial guesses. Letters like S, T, R, N, E, A are frequently used in English. I should aim for a word with a good mix to cover more possibilities.

One classic starting word I've heard is ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. It covers multiple vowels and consonants. Another one like ""SLATE"" also seems good.

But let me think about ""RAISE"". That has R, A, I, S, E. I is also a common vowel. S, T, R, N, E, A are all top letters. Perhaps ""STERN"" could work.

I recall that ""ADIEU"" is sometimes used because it has many vowels, but it misses some consonants, so it might not be as efficient for first guess. Consonants are equally important.

To balance it, I think ""CRATE"" or ""ROAST"" could be decent. Let me settle on something.

Perhaps the best is to choose a word with no repeating letters to cover more ground. Letters that appear twice in a word give less information if they're not in the secret word.

So, a word like ""SPINE"" – S, P, I, N, E. Not bad.

How about ""AUDIO""? That's mostly vowels but lacks consonants.

I think ""CRANE"" is solid: C, R, A, N, E. That touches upon several common letters.

Another option is ""SALET"", but that might be less common; I need a valid English word.

""CRANE"" is definitely valid.

Since the feedback was given in the example with ""STORM"", ""BRAVE"", ""BRISK"", but that's just an example.

I should just go with a standard opener.

Let me choose ""CRANE"".

After this guess, I'll get feedback with ✓, -, or x for each position, which will help me narrow down the possibilities.

For now, I need to output the guess in the specified format.

So, my step-by-step thought: I've decided to start with ""CRANE"" because it includes common consonants and vowels, giving a good spread of information.

I need to make my first guess in this word-guessing game. Since I don't have any prior feedback, I should choose a word that maximizes the information gained. This means selecting a 5-letter English word with common vowels and consonants to test a broad range of letters. A good starter word often includes letters like R, S, T, L, N, E, or A, as they appear frequently in English words.

Considering options:
- ""ADIEU"" has many vowels but lacks common consonants, potentially yielding less useful data for consonants.
- ""SLATE"" uses S, L, A, T, E—a solid mix with both vowels and common consonants.
- ""CRANE"" is a classic first guess because it includes C, R, A, N, E, covering multiple high-frequency letters without repeats.

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess. It contains three vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N), which should help identify correct letters or positions efficiently, no matter what the secret word is. After this, the feedback will guide my next move by showing which letters are correct, present but misplaced, or absent.

Alright, let's tackle this step by step. The first guess was ""CRANE,"" and the feedback shows: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x). This means that:

- C is not in the secret word at all.
- R is not in the secret word.
- A is present in the word but in the wrong position.
- N and E are not in the word.

So, the secret word contains the letter A, but it's not in the third position where I guessed it. Since A is somewhere else, and C, R, N, E are absent, I need to choose a new word that includes A but avoids C, R, N, E entirely. Also, since A is not in position 3, it could be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Now, considering possible letters for the new guess, I should include A and try other common consonants that haven't been ruled out yet. From the first guess, I've eliminated C, R, N, E. Common letters still available include S, T, L, O, U, D, M, P, B, and others. But since A is confirmed present, I should prioritize words that have A in various positions to test its placement.

Starting position possibilities for A: It could be in 1, 2, 4, or 5. To gather more information efficiently, I might pick a word where A is in a different spot than the third. A word with A in position 1 could be ""AUDIO,"" but ""AUDIO"" has U and O, which I haven't tested yet. Alternatively, ""PLANT"" has N and T, but N was already ruled out, so that's not valid since N is absent.

Since A is misplaced and wasn't in position 3, my next word needs to include A somewhere else—like position 1, 2, 4, or 5—and avoid C, R, N, E. Let me think of words with A in different positions. For example:

- Position 1: Words like ""ABOUT,"" ""ALONE,"" ""ADMIT.""
- Position 2: ""PAINT,"" ""MAIZE,"" but MAIZE has Z which might be less common. ""PAINT"" includes N which is excluded.
- Position 4: ""TRAIN"" has R which is excluded. ""PLAIN"" has P, L, A, I, N—N is excluded.
- Position 5: ""MEDIA"" has E and D—E is excluded, so no.

Finding words without C, R, N, E: Letters available—S, T, L, O, U, D, M, P, B, G, H, Y, etc. Possible words with A: ""PLAST,"" but that's not a word. Valid words: ""SALTY"" has S, A, L, T, Y. That includes A in position 2, avoids forbidden letters. ""PASTA"" has P, A, S, T, A? Wait, A repeated? But ""PASTA"" has A at positions 2 and 5. It's a valid word. However, since I haven't tested S, T, P before, this could work.

Another option: ""SHALT"" but archaic; need common words. ""SLATE"" has E, but E is excluded. So avoid E. ""STAND"" has N—excluded. ""BLEAK"" has E and K? E excluded.

Better words: ""PATIO"" uses P, A, T, I, O. Avoids C,R,N,E. A is in position 2. ""PIANO"" has O but also N—excluded. No. ""TIPSY"" no A. Must include A.

""OASIS"" has double S and O, A in position 2. But double letters might complicate feedback if S is correct or not. Not ideal for second guess.

""MEDIA"" has E—out. ""ALIGN"" has N—out. ""ABOUT"" is good: A in position 1, B,O,U,T. Letters B,O,U,T haven't been tested. Also avoids excluded letters. Similarly, ""ATOMS"" has M,S—T and S are untested. A in position 1.

""PANSY"" has N and S—N is excluded, so invalid. Need no N.

Another one: ""BLAME"" has E—excluded. Same with ""FLAME,"" etc.

""SALAD"" double A but A is already confirmed present. Still, might be okay. Position 1 and 3? Third position is problematic since A is not there? The feedback said A(-) meaning present but wrong position. Since guessed position 3 was wrong, A cannot be in position 3. So in ""SALAD"", if I guess S,A,L,A,D—positions: A at 2 and 4. Could still work, but repeating letters might give less info if A isn't doubled. But secret word might not have two A's, so guessing one A is fine.

To test multiple new letters, I should avoid repeats. So ""ABOUT"" is solid: positions A,B,O,U,T—all untested letters. A at pos 1, B,O,U,T new. Similarly, ""ADOPT"" has A at pos 1, D,O,P,T. Avoids bad letters.

""ADOPT"" has O,P,D,T—common. Could work. ""ABOUT"" has U and O.

Another good word: ""PLAIT"" P,L,A,I,T? Or ""PILOT"" no A. ""TABLE"" has E—excluded.

""SHAKE"" has E? E excluded. ""CHAIN"" has H and N—N excluded.

Concentrate on avoiding C,R,N,E and including A in not-pos-3.

""BALMY"" B,A,L,M,Y. Y is possible. Or ""SAUCE"" has C? C excluded—C is x, so avoid C.

Don't use C.

""MANGO"" has N—no. ""TODAY"" A at end? T,O,D,A,Y—Y possible. A in position 4. Or ""PARTY"" has R—R excluded.

R is absent, so avoid R.

""FOCUS"" has F,O,C,U,S—C excluded. Bad.

Valid words without C,R,N,E: A included, say ""TOADY""? Or ""TOAST"" has T,O,A,S,T—S double? ""TOAST"" has T,O,A,S,T—positions 1=T,2=O,3=A,4=S,5=T. But guessed A in position 3? First guess had A in pos 3 and it was marked ""-"", meaning A is present but not in pos 3. So guessing A in pos 3 again might not help directly. If I use ""TOAST"", A is at pos 3, but we already know it's not there because of first feedback. So useless to put A there again—better to move it elsewhere to find correct position.

So, choose a word where A is in position 1,2,4, or 5—ideally a spot I suspect. But since I don't know, spread it around.

""ABOUT"" A at 1, B,O,U,T elsewhere. That tests position 1 for A.

Other positions: ""SPLAT"" no E? S,P,L,A,T—A at pos 4. S and T common. But L and P new. ""SPALT"" not word. ""PAINT"" has N—invalid.

""VALID"" V,A,L,I,D—possible, V less common. Maybe too rare.

""GLAZE"" has E—out.

So perhaps ""ABOUT"" is a safe choice. Or ""ADOPT"".

Another one: ""AUDIO"" A,U,D,I,O—U,D,I,O new. A at pos 1.

But ""AUDIO"" uses letters that might be less frequent—U,D,I,O. Whereas ""ABOUT"" has B,O,U,T—B and T are common.

Similarly, ""MAPLE"" has E—excluded.

I think ""ABOUT"" or ""ADOPT"" are reasonable. Let's go with ""ADOPT"" to test D,O,P,T along with A.

Could use ""PLAIT"" P,L,A,I,T—A at pos 3? But first feedback said A not at pos 3, so guessing it there again wastes an opportunity. If A is not at 3, misplacing it again doesn't help pinpoint where it is. Better to move it.

To verify: feedback shows A present but not pos 3. So if I guess A in a new position, say pos 1 in ""ADOPT"", I might get:

- If A is actually at pos 1, I get ✓ for position.
- If A is at pos 4 or whatever, I get - indicating it's elsewhere.
- But by guessing pos 1, even if wrong, I learn it's not there, narrowing to pos 2,4,5.

Similarly, if I guess pos 2, like in ""SAINT"" but N excluded. Or ""TASTE"" E excluded.

Therefore, ""ADOPT"" seems good—D,O,P,T new letters, A at position 2? No, ""ADOPT"": A-D-O-P-T. Positions: A at 1? Let's spell: A at position 1? ADOPT: A is first letter? A-D-O-P-T, so position 1: A, pos 2: D, pos 3: O, pos 4: P, pos 5: T. So A in pos 1.

Perfect. I avoid testing A in known-wrong pos 3.

So guess: ADOPT? Or ABOUT? Let's decide.

Alternatively, ""HAVOC"" H,A,V,O,C—but C excluded, invalid since C is out.

No.

""CARGO"" C and R excluded.

""PASTA"": P,A,S,T,A—double A. Positions: P at 1, A at 2, S at 3, T at 4, A at 5? But S at 3. First, S is new. But testing A at pos 2 and 5. Since A might not be double, but could.

Compared to ""ADOPT"", which has no duplicates.

I think ""ADOPT"" is fine. 

Other: ""BADLY"" B,A,D,L,Y—L and Y untested. Position 2 for A.

Could test different position.

To maximize letters, ""ABOUT"" has U, which is less common than others? 

Perhaps ""SLATE"" but E excluded—invalid.

Must avoid E.

""TOADY"" T,O,A,D,Y—A at pos 3? Again, pos 3 is known wrong for A—should not guess A there. T-O-A-D-Y: A at position 3—exactly where we know it's not. So bad guess—I'd waste information.

So avoid words with A in position 3.

Similarly, for ""ADOPT"": A is at 1, not 3. Good.

""DAUNT"" has N—excluded.

""GUILD"" no A.

So, I'll choose ""ABOUT"" because it includes U and O, both vowels, to test.

But U might be less common. ""ABOUT"" has A,B,O,U,T—letters B,O,U,T new, with A in pos 1.

Possibly ""PLAID"" P,L,A,I,D—D untested. A at pos 3? Position 3—should avoid. P-L-A-I-D: A at pos 3—same issue. Not good.

Therefore, words where A is at 1: ""ABOUT"", ""ADOPT"", ""AUDIO"", ""ATOMS""

A at 2: ""SAINT"" but N excluded; ""GAUDY"" G,A,U,D,Y; or ""FATAL"" but F possibly rare.

""QUALM"" Q maybe too rare.

A at 4: ""OPIUM"" no A? Must include A. ""METAL"" E excluded; ""FOCAL"" C excluded. ""OVARY"" O,V,A,R,Y—R excluded. Bad.

A at 5: ""PIETA"" P,I,E,T,A—E excluded; ""TULIP"" U,L,I,P,T—no A; ""STAIR"" R excluded.

Hard to find words with A in position 4 or 5 without excluded letters. Easier to guess A in position 1 or 2.

Position 2: ""GAUID"" not word; ""SALTY"" A at pos 2? S-A-L-T-Y—yes position 2. S,A,L,T,Y. Letters S,L,T,Y new—all untested. A at position 2.

Similarly, ""HAPPY"" double P, not ideal.

""SALTY"" sounds good.

Moreover, S,L,T,Y are all common letters. 

Comparing to ""ABOUT"": U might be less common. ""SALTY"" uses S,L,T—all high-frequency.

Plus, in terms of vowel/consonant mix.

Therefore, I'll go with ""SALTY"" to test A in position 2 and new letters S,L,T,Y.

So guess: SALTY.

But ensure it's valid: SALTY is a common word.

Also, avoids C,R,N,E—all excluded letters.
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from Guess 1 (""CRANE""):
- C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- A is in the secret word but not in position 3 (marked ""-"").

Based on this, the secret word contains the letter A, which must appear in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since position 3 is incorrect). Additionally, the new guess must exclude C, R, N, E entirely and include A in one of these other positions to narrow down its location.

To maximize information, the next guess should:
1. Include A in a position not tested before (avoid position 3).
2. Introduce new common letters that haven't been eliminated (e.g., S, T, L, B, O, U, D, P).
3. Avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.

Considering options:
- Avoid words with A in position 3 (redundant based on feedback).
- Position 1 for A: Words like ""ABOUT"" or ""ADOPT"" are possible but may include less frequent letters (e.g., U).
- Position 2 for A: Words like ""SALTY"" (S, A, L, T, Y) place A in position 2 and use common consonants—making it efficient for testing multiple new letters.
- Position 4 or 5 for A is harder due to excluded letters (e.g., ""METAL"" invalid due to E). 

""SALTY"" is a strong choice:
- Tests A in position 2 (new position) to determine if it's correct or misplaced.
- Introduces high-frequency letters S, L, T, Y (all untested).
- Avoids C, R, N, E and doesn't repeat letters.
- If A is not in position 2, the feedback will help eliminate more positions.

Thus, ""SALTY"" is selected as the second guess.

<guess>SALTY</guess>",SALTY,"Alright, let's tackle this step by step. The first guess was ""CRANE,"" and the feedback shows: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x). This means that:

- C is not in the secret word at all.
- R is not in the secret word.
- A is present in the word but in the wrong position.
- N and E are not in the word.

So, the secret word contains the letter A, but it's not in the third position where I guessed it. Since A is somewhere else, and C, R, N, E are absent, I need to choose a new word that includes A but avoids C, R, N, E entirely. Also, since A is not in position 3, it could be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Now, considering possible letters for the new guess, I should include A and try other common consonants that haven't been ruled out yet. From the first guess, I've eliminated C, R, N, E. Common letters still available include S, T, L, O, U, D, M, P, B, and others. But since A is confirmed present, I should prioritize words that have A in various positions to test its placement.

Starting position possibilities for A: It could be in 1, 2, 4, or 5. To gather more information efficiently, I might pick a word where A is in a different spot than the third. A word with A in position 1 could be ""AUDIO,"" but ""AUDIO"" has U and O, which I haven't tested yet. Alternatively, ""PLANT"" has N and T, but N was already ruled out, so that's not valid since N is absent.

Since A is misplaced and wasn't in position 3, my next word needs to include A somewhere else—like position 1, 2, 4, or 5—and avoid C, R, N, E. Let me think of words with A in different positions. For example:

- Position 1: Words like ""ABOUT,"" ""ALONE,"" ""ADMIT.""
- Position 2: ""PAINT,"" ""MAIZE,"" but MAIZE has Z which might be less common. ""PAINT"" includes N which is excluded.
- Position 4: ""TRAIN"" has R which is excluded. ""PLAIN"" has P, L, A, I, N—N is excluded.
- Position 5: ""MEDIA"" has E and D—E is excluded, so no.

Finding words without C, R, N, E: Letters available—S, T, L, O, U, D, M, P, B, G, H, Y, etc. Possible words with A: ""PLAST,"" but that's not a word. Valid words: ""SALTY"" has S, A, L, T, Y. That includes A in position 2, avoids forbidden letters. ""PASTA"" has P, A, S, T, A? Wait, A repeated? But ""PASTA"" has A at positions 2 and 5. It's a valid word. However, since I haven't tested S, T, P before, this could work.

Another option: ""SHALT"" but archaic; need common words. ""SLATE"" has E, but E is excluded. So avoid E. ""STAND"" has N—excluded. ""BLEAK"" has E and K? E excluded.

Better words: ""PATIO"" uses P, A, T, I, O. Avoids C,R,N,E. A is in position 2. ""PIANO"" has O but also N—excluded. No. ""TIPSY"" no A. Must include A.

""OASIS"" has double S and O, A in position 2. But double letters might complicate feedback if S is correct or not. Not ideal for second guess.

""MEDIA"" has E—out. ""ALIGN"" has N—out. ""ABOUT"" is good: A in position 1, B,O,U,T. Letters B,O,U,T haven't been tested. Also avoids excluded letters. Similarly, ""ATOMS"" has M,S—T and S are untested. A in position 1.

""PANSY"" has N and S—N is excluded, so invalid. Need no N.

Another one: ""BLAME"" has E—excluded. Same with ""FLAME,"" etc.

""SALAD"" double A but A is already confirmed present. Still, might be okay. Position 1 and 3? Third position is problematic since A is not there? The feedback said A(-) meaning present but wrong position. Since guessed position 3 was wrong, A cannot be in position 3. So in ""SALAD"", if I guess S,A,L,A,D—positions: A at 2 and 4. Could still work, but repeating letters might give less info if A isn't doubled. But secret word might not have two A's, so guessing one A is fine.

To test multiple new letters, I should avoid repeats. So ""ABOUT"" is solid: positions A,B,O,U,T—all untested letters. A at pos 1, B,O,U,T new. Similarly, ""ADOPT"" has A at pos 1, D,O,P,T. Avoids bad letters.

""ADOPT"" has O,P,D,T—common. Could work. ""ABOUT"" has U and O.

Another good word: ""PLAIT"" P,L,A,I,T? Or ""PILOT"" no A. ""TABLE"" has E—excluded.

""SHAKE"" has E? E excluded. ""CHAIN"" has H and N—N excluded.

Concentrate on avoiding C,R,N,E and including A in not-pos-3.

""BALMY"" B,A,L,M,Y. Y is possible. Or ""SAUCE"" has C? C excluded—C is x, so avoid C.

Don't use C.

""MANGO"" has N—no. ""TODAY"" A at end? T,O,D,A,Y—Y possible. A in position 4. Or ""PARTY"" has R—R excluded.

R is absent, so avoid R.

""FOCUS"" has F,O,C,U,S—C excluded. Bad.

Valid words without C,R,N,E: A included, say ""TOADY""? Or ""TOAST"" has T,O,A,S,T—S double? ""TOAST"" has T,O,A,S,T—positions 1=T,2=O,3=A,4=S,5=T. But guessed A in position 3? First guess had A in pos 3 and it was marked ""-"", meaning A is present but not in pos 3. So guessing A in pos 3 again might not help directly. If I use ""TOAST"", A is at pos 3, but we already know it's not there because of first feedback. So useless to put A there again—better to move it elsewhere to find correct position.

So, choose a word where A is in position 1,2,4, or 5—ideally a spot I suspect. But since I don't know, spread it around.

""ABOUT"" A at 1, B,O,U,T elsewhere. That tests position 1 for A.

Other positions: ""SPLAT"" no E? S,P,L,A,T—A at pos 4. S and T common. But L and P new. ""SPALT"" not word. ""PAINT"" has N—invalid.

""VALID"" V,A,L,I,D—possible, V less common. Maybe too rare.

""GLAZE"" has E—out.

So perhaps ""ABOUT"" is a safe choice. Or ""ADOPT"".

Another one: ""AUDIO"" A,U,D,I,O—U,D,I,O new. A at pos 1.

But ""AUDIO"" uses letters that might be less frequent—U,D,I,O. Whereas ""ABOUT"" has B,O,U,T—B and T are common.

Similarly, ""MAPLE"" has E—excluded.

I think ""ABOUT"" or ""ADOPT"" are reasonable. Let's go with ""ADOPT"" to test D,O,P,T along with A.

Could use ""PLAIT"" P,L,A,I,T—A at pos 3? But first feedback said A not at pos 3, so guessing it there again wastes an opportunity. If A is not at 3, misplacing it again doesn't help pinpoint where it is. Better to move it.

To verify: feedback shows A present but not pos 3. So if I guess A in a new position, say pos 1 in ""ADOPT"", I might get:

- If A is actually at pos 1, I get ✓ for position.
- If A is at pos 4 or whatever, I get - indicating it's elsewhere.
- But by guessing pos 1, even if wrong, I learn it's not there, narrowing to pos 2,4,5.

Similarly, if I guess pos 2, like in ""SAINT"" but N excluded. Or ""TASTE"" E excluded.

Therefore, ""ADOPT"" seems good—D,O,P,T new letters, A at position 2? No, ""ADOPT"": A-D-O-P-T. Positions: A at 1? Let's spell: A at position 1? ADOPT: A is first letter? A-D-O-P-T, so position 1: A, pos 2: D, pos 3: O, pos 4: P, pos 5: T. So A in pos 1.

Perfect. I avoid testing A in known-wrong pos 3.

So guess: ADOPT? Or ABOUT? Let's decide.

Alternatively, ""HAVOC"" H,A,V,O,C—but C excluded, invalid since C is out.

No.

""CARGO"" C and R excluded.

""PASTA"": P,A,S,T,A—double A. Positions: P at 1, A at 2, S at 3, T at 4, A at 5? But S at 3. First, S is new. But testing A at pos 2 and 5. Since A might not be double, but could.

Compared to ""ADOPT"", which has no duplicates.

I think ""ADOPT"" is fine. 

Other: ""BADLY"" B,A,D,L,Y—L and Y untested. Position 2 for A.

Could test different position.

To maximize letters, ""ABOUT"" has U, which is less common than others? 

Perhaps ""SLATE"" but E excluded—invalid.

Must avoid E.

""TOADY"" T,O,A,D,Y—A at pos 3? Again, pos 3 is known wrong for A—should not guess A there. T-O-A-D-Y: A at position 3—exactly where we know it's not. So bad guess—I'd waste information.

So avoid words with A in position 3.

Similarly, for ""ADOPT"": A is at 1, not 3. Good.

""DAUNT"" has N—excluded.

""GUILD"" no A.

So, I'll choose ""ABOUT"" because it includes U and O, both vowels, to test.

But U might be less common. ""ABOUT"" has A,B,O,U,T—letters B,O,U,T new, with A in pos 1.

Possibly ""PLAID"" P,L,A,I,D—D untested. A at pos 3? Position 3—should avoid. P-L-A-I-D: A at pos 3—same issue. Not good.

Therefore, words where A is at 1: ""ABOUT"", ""ADOPT"", ""AUDIO"", ""ATOMS""

A at 2: ""SAINT"" but N excluded; ""GAUDY"" G,A,U,D,Y; or ""FATAL"" but F possibly rare.

""QUALM"" Q maybe too rare.

A at 4: ""OPIUM"" no A? Must include A. ""METAL"" E excluded; ""FOCAL"" C excluded. ""OVARY"" O,V,A,R,Y—R excluded. Bad.

A at 5: ""PIETA"" P,I,E,T,A—E excluded; ""TULIP"" U,L,I,P,T—no A; ""STAIR"" R excluded.

Hard to find words with A in position 4 or 5 without excluded letters. Easier to guess A in position 1 or 2.

Position 2: ""GAUID"" not word; ""SALTY"" A at pos 2? S-A-L-T-Y—yes position 2. S,A,L,T,Y. Letters S,L,T,Y new—all untested. A at position 2.

Similarly, ""HAPPY"" double P, not ideal.

""SALTY"" sounds good.

Moreover, S,L,T,Y are all common letters. 

Comparing to ""ABOUT"": U might be less common. ""SALTY"" uses S,L,T—all high-frequency.

Plus, in terms of vowel/consonant mix.

Therefore, I'll go with ""SALTY"" to test A in position 2 and new letters S,L,T,Y.

So guess: SALTY.

But ensure it's valid: SALTY is a common word.

Also, avoids C,R,N,E—all excluded letters.After analyzing the feedback from Guess 1 (""CRANE""):
- C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- A is in the secret word but not in position 3 (marked ""-"").

Based on this, the secret word contains the letter A, which must appear in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since position 3 is incorrect). Additionally, the new guess must exclude C, R, N, E entirely and include A in one of these other positions to narrow down its location.

To maximize information, the next guess should:
1. Include A in a position not tested before (avoid position 3).
2. Introduce new common letters that haven't been eliminated (e.g., S, T, L, B, O, U, D, P).
3. Avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.

Considering options:
- Avoid words with A in position 3 (redundant based on feedback).
- Position 1 for A: Words like ""ABOUT"" or ""ADOPT"" are possible but may include less frequent letters (e.g., U).
- Position 2 for A: Words like ""SALTY"" (S, A, L, T, Y) place A in position 2 and use common consonants—making it efficient for testing multiple new letters.
- Position 4 or 5 for A is harder due to excluded letters (e.g., ""METAL"" invalid due to E). 

""SALTY"" is a strong choice:
- Tests A in position 2 (new position) to determine if it's correct or misplaced.
- Introduces high-frequency letters S, L, T, Y (all untested).
- Avoids C, R, N, E and doesn't repeat letters.
- If A is not in position 2, the feedback will help eliminate more positions.

Thus, ""SALTY"" is selected as the second guess.",Guess 2: SALTY -> FEEDBACK: S(-) A(✓) L(-) T(x) Y(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,basil,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>I'm starting my first guess in this Wordle-like game. I have to guess a 5-letter English word, and I'll get feedback on how close it is to the secret word. Since it's my first try, I want a word that uses common letters to maximize the information I get.

Common vowels and consonants are good for initial guesses. Letters like S, T, R, N, E, A are frequently used in English. I should aim for a word with a good mix to cover more possibilities.

One classic starting word I've heard is ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. It covers multiple vowels and consonants. Another one like ""SLATE"" also seems good.

But let me think about ""RAISE"". That has R, A, I, S, E. I is also a common vowel. S, T, R, N, E, A are all top letters. Perhaps ""STERN"" could work.

I recall that ""ADIEU"" is sometimes used because it has many vowels, but it misses some consonants, so it might not be as efficient for first guess. Consonants are equally important.

To balance it, I think ""CRATE"" or ""ROAST"" could be decent. Let me settle on something.

Perhaps the best is to choose a word with no repeating letters to cover more ground. Letters that appear twice in a word give less information if they're not in the secret word.

So, a word like ""SPINE"" – S, P, I, N, E. Not bad.

How about ""AUDIO""? That's mostly vowels but lacks consonants.

I think ""CRANE"" is solid: C, R, A, N, E. That touches upon several common letters.

Another option is ""SALET"", but that might be less common; I need a valid English word.

""CRANE"" is definitely valid.

Since the feedback was given in the example with ""STORM"", ""BRAVE"", ""BRISK"", but that's just an example.

I should just go with a standard opener.

Let me choose ""CRANE"".

After this guess, I'll get feedback with ✓, -, or x for each position, which will help me narrow down the possibilities.

For now, I need to output the guess in the specified format.

So, my step-by-step thought: I've decided to start with ""CRANE"" because it includes common consonants and vowels, giving a good spread of information.I need to make my first guess in this word-guessing game. Since I don't have any prior feedback, I should choose a word that maximizes the information gained. This means selecting a 5-letter English word with common vowels and consonants to test a broad range of letters. A good starter word often includes letters like R, S, T, L, N, E, or A, as they appear frequently in English words.

Considering options:
- ""ADIEU"" has many vowels but lacks common consonants, potentially yielding less useful data for consonants.
- ""SLATE"" uses S, L, A, T, E—a solid mix with both vowels and common consonants.
- ""CRANE"" is a classic first guess because it includes C, R, A, N, E, covering multiple high-frequency letters without repeats.

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess. It contains three vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N), which should help identify correct letters or positions efficiently, no matter what the secret word is. After this, the feedback will guide my next move by showing which letters are correct, present but misplaced, or absent.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>Alright, let's tackle this step by step. The first guess was ""CRANE,"" and the feedback shows: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x). This means that:

- C is not in the secret word at all.
- R is not in the secret word.
- A is present in the word but in the wrong position.
- N and E are not in the word.

So, the secret word contains the letter A, but it's not in the third position where I guessed it. Since A is somewhere else, and C, R, N, E are absent, I need to choose a new word that includes A but avoids C, R, N, E entirely. Also, since A is not in position 3, it could be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Now, considering possible letters for the new guess, I should include A and try other common consonants that haven't been ruled out yet. From the first guess, I've eliminated C, R, N, E. Common letters still available include S, T, L, O, U, D, M, P, B, and others. But since A is confirmed present, I should prioritize words that have A in various positions to test its placement.

Starting position possibilities for A: It could be in 1, 2, 4, or 5. To gather more information efficiently, I might pick a word where A is in a different spot than the third. A word with A in position 1 could be ""AUDIO,"" but ""AUDIO"" has U and O, which I haven't tested yet. Alternatively, ""PLANT"" has N and T, but N was already ruled out, so that's not valid since N is absent.

Since A is misplaced and wasn't in position 3, my next word needs to include A somewhere else—like position 1, 2, 4, or 5—and avoid C, R, N, E. Let me think of words with A in different positions. For example:

- Position 1: Words like ""ABOUT,"" ""ALONE,"" ""ADMIT.""
- Position 2: ""PAINT,"" ""MAIZE,"" but MAIZE has Z which might be less common. ""PAINT"" includes N which is excluded.
- Position 4: ""TRAIN"" has R which is excluded. ""PLAIN"" has P, L, A, I, N—N is excluded.
- Position 5: ""MEDIA"" has E and D—E is excluded, so no.

Finding words without C, R, N, E: Letters available—S, T, L, O, U, D, M, P, B, G, H, Y, etc. Possible words with A: ""PLAST,"" but that's not a word. Valid words: ""SALTY"" has S, A, L, T, Y. That includes A in position 2, avoids forbidden letters. ""PASTA"" has P, A, S, T, A? Wait, A repeated? But ""PASTA"" has A at positions 2 and 5. It's a valid word. However, since I haven't tested S, T, P before, this could work.

Another option: ""SHALT"" but archaic; need common words. ""SLATE"" has E, but E is excluded. So avoid E. ""STAND"" has N—excluded. ""BLEAK"" has E and K? E excluded.

Better words: ""PATIO"" uses P, A, T, I, O. Avoids C,R,N,E. A is in position 2. ""PIANO"" has O but also N—excluded. No. ""TIPSY"" no A. Must include A.

""OASIS"" has double S and O, A in position 2. But double letters might complicate feedback if S is correct or not. Not ideal for second guess.

""MEDIA"" has E—out. ""ALIGN"" has N—out. ""ABOUT"" is good: A in position 1, B,O,U,T. Letters B,O,U,T haven't been tested. Also avoids excluded letters. Similarly, ""ATOMS"" has M,S—T and S are untested. A in position 1.

""PANSY"" has N and S—N is excluded, so invalid. Need no N.

Another one: ""BLAME"" has E—excluded. Same with ""FLAME,"" etc.

""SALAD"" double A but A is already confirmed present. Still, might be okay. Position 1 and 3? Third position is problematic since A is not there? The feedback said A(-) meaning present but wrong position. Since guessed position 3 was wrong, A cannot be in position 3. So in ""SALAD"", if I guess S,A,L,A,D—positions: A at 2 and 4. Could still work, but repeating letters might give less info if A isn't doubled. But secret word might not have two A's, so guessing one A is fine.

To test multiple new letters, I should avoid repeats. So ""ABOUT"" is solid: positions A,B,O,U,T—all untested letters. A at pos 1, B,O,U,T new. Similarly, ""ADOPT"" has A at pos 1, D,O,P,T. Avoids bad letters.

""ADOPT"" has O,P,D,T—common. Could work. ""ABOUT"" has U and O.

Another good word: ""PLAIT"" P,L,A,I,T? Or ""PILOT"" no A. ""TABLE"" has E—excluded.

""SHAKE"" has E? E excluded. ""CHAIN"" has H and N—N excluded.

Concentrate on avoiding C,R,N,E and including A in not-pos-3.

""BALMY"" B,A,L,M,Y. Y is possible. Or ""SAUCE"" has C? C excluded—C is x, so avoid C.

Don't use C.

""MANGO"" has N—no. ""TODAY"" A at end? T,O,D,A,Y—Y possible. A in position 4. Or ""PARTY"" has R—R excluded.

R is absent, so avoid R.

""FOCUS"" has F,O,C,U,S—C excluded. Bad.

Valid words without C,R,N,E: A included, say ""TOADY""? Or ""TOAST"" has T,O,A,S,T—S double? ""TOAST"" has T,O,A,S,T—positions 1=T,2=O,3=A,4=S,5=T. But guessed A in position 3? First guess had A in pos 3 and it was marked ""-"", meaning A is present but not in pos 3. So guessing A in pos 3 again might not help directly. If I use ""TOAST"", A is at pos 3, but we already know it's not there because of first feedback. So useless to put A there again—better to move it elsewhere to find correct position.

So, choose a word where A is in position 1,2,4, or 5—ideally a spot I suspect. But since I don't know, spread it around.

""ABOUT"" A at 1, B,O,U,T elsewhere. That tests position 1 for A.

Other positions: ""SPLAT"" no E? S,P,L,A,T—A at pos 4. S and T common. But L and P new. ""SPALT"" not word. ""PAINT"" has N—invalid.

""VALID"" V,A,L,I,D—possible, V less common. Maybe too rare.

""GLAZE"" has E—out.

So perhaps ""ABOUT"" is a safe choice. Or ""ADOPT"".

Another one: ""AUDIO"" A,U,D,I,O—U,D,I,O new. A at pos 1.

But ""AUDIO"" uses letters that might be less frequent—U,D,I,O. Whereas ""ABOUT"" has B,O,U,T—B and T are common.

Similarly, ""MAPLE"" has E—excluded.

I think ""ABOUT"" or ""ADOPT"" are reasonable. Let's go with ""ADOPT"" to test D,O,P,T along with A.

Could use ""PLAIT"" P,L,A,I,T—A at pos 3? But first feedback said A not at pos 3, so guessing it there again wastes an opportunity. If A is not at 3, misplacing it again doesn't help pinpoint where it is. Better to move it.

To verify: feedback shows A present but not pos 3. So if I guess A in a new position, say pos 1 in ""ADOPT"", I might get:

- If A is actually at pos 1, I get ✓ for position.
- If A is at pos 4 or whatever, I get - indicating it's elsewhere.
- But by guessing pos 1, even if wrong, I learn it's not there, narrowing to pos 2,4,5.

Similarly, if I guess pos 2, like in ""SAINT"" but N excluded. Or ""TASTE"" E excluded.

Therefore, ""ADOPT"" seems good—D,O,P,T new letters, A at position 2? No, ""ADOPT"": A-D-O-P-T. Positions: A at 1? Let's spell: A at position 1? ADOPT: A is first letter? A-D-O-P-T, so position 1: A, pos 2: D, pos 3: O, pos 4: P, pos 5: T. So A in pos 1.

Perfect. I avoid testing A in known-wrong pos 3.

So guess: ADOPT? Or ABOUT? Let's decide.

Alternatively, ""HAVOC"" H,A,V,O,C—but C excluded, invalid since C is out.

No.

""CARGO"" C and R excluded.

""PASTA"": P,A,S,T,A—double A. Positions: P at 1, A at 2, S at 3, T at 4, A at 5? But S at 3. First, S is new. But testing A at pos 2 and 5. Since A might not be double, but could.

Compared to ""ADOPT"", which has no duplicates.

I think ""ADOPT"" is fine. 

Other: ""BADLY"" B,A,D,L,Y—L and Y untested. Position 2 for A.

Could test different position.

To maximize letters, ""ABOUT"" has U, which is less common than others? 

Perhaps ""SLATE"" but E excluded—invalid.

Must avoid E.

""TOADY"" T,O,A,D,Y—A at pos 3? Again, pos 3 is known wrong for A—should not guess A there. T-O-A-D-Y: A at position 3—exactly where we know it's not. So bad guess—I'd waste information.

So avoid words with A in position 3.

Similarly, for ""ADOPT"": A is at 1, not 3. Good.

""DAUNT"" has N—excluded.

""GUILD"" no A.

So, I'll choose ""ABOUT"" because it includes U and O, both vowels, to test.

But U might be less common. ""ABOUT"" has A,B,O,U,T—letters B,O,U,T new, with A in pos 1.

Possibly ""PLAID"" P,L,A,I,D—D untested. A at pos 3? Position 3—should avoid. P-L-A-I-D: A at pos 3—same issue. Not good.

Therefore, words where A is at 1: ""ABOUT"", ""ADOPT"", ""AUDIO"", ""ATOMS""

A at 2: ""SAINT"" but N excluded; ""GAUDY"" G,A,U,D,Y; or ""FATAL"" but F possibly rare.

""QUALM"" Q maybe too rare.

A at 4: ""OPIUM"" no A? Must include A. ""METAL"" E excluded; ""FOCAL"" C excluded. ""OVARY"" O,V,A,R,Y—R excluded. Bad.

A at 5: ""PIETA"" P,I,E,T,A—E excluded; ""TULIP"" U,L,I,P,T—no A; ""STAIR"" R excluded.

Hard to find words with A in position 4 or 5 without excluded letters. Easier to guess A in position 1 or 2.

Position 2: ""GAUID"" not word; ""SALTY"" A at pos 2? S-A-L-T-Y—yes position 2. S,A,L,T,Y. Letters S,L,T,Y new—all untested. A at position 2.

Similarly, ""HAPPY"" double P, not ideal.

""SALTY"" sounds good.

Moreover, S,L,T,Y are all common letters. 

Comparing to ""ABOUT"": U might be less common. ""SALTY"" uses S,L,T—all high-frequency.

Plus, in terms of vowel/consonant mix.

Therefore, I'll go with ""SALTY"" to test A in position 2 and new letters S,L,T,Y.

So guess: SALTY.

But ensure it's valid: SALTY is a common word.

Also, avoids C,R,N,E—all excluded letters.After analyzing the feedback from Guess 1 (""CRANE""):
- C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- A is in the secret word but not in position 3 (marked ""-"").

Based on this, the secret word contains the letter A, which must appear in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since position 3 is incorrect). Additionally, the new guess must exclude C, R, N, E entirely and include A in one of these other positions to narrow down its location.

To maximize information, the next guess should:
1. Include A in a position not tested before (avoid position 3).
2. Introduce new common letters that haven't been eliminated (e.g., S, T, L, B, O, U, D, P).
3. Avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.

Considering options:
- Avoid words with A in position 3 (redundant based on feedback).
- Position 1 for A: Words like ""ABOUT"" or ""ADOPT"" are possible but may include less frequent letters (e.g., U).
- Position 2 for A: Words like ""SALTY"" (S, A, L, T, Y) place A in position 2 and use common consonants—making it efficient for testing multiple new letters.
- Position 4 or 5 for A is harder due to excluded letters (e.g., ""METAL"" invalid due to E). 

""SALTY"" is a strong choice:
- Tests A in position 2 (new position) to determine if it's correct or misplaced.
- Introduces high-frequency letters S, L, T, Y (all untested).
- Avoids C, R, N, E and doesn't repeat letters.
- If A is not in position 2, the feedback will help eliminate more positions.

Thus, ""SALTY"" is selected as the second guess.

I have to guess a 5-letter English word, and I\'ll get feedback on how close it is to the secret word. Since it\'s my first try, I want a word that uses common letters to maximize the information I get.\n\nCommon vowels and consonants are good for initial guesses. Letters like S, T, R, N, E, A are frequently used in English. I should aim for a word with a good mix to cover more possibilities.\n\nOne classic starting word I\'ve heard is ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. It covers multiple vowels and consonants. Another one like ""SLATE"" also seems good.\n\nBut let me think about ""RAISE"". That has R, A, I, S, E. I is also a common vowel. S, T, R, N, E, A are all top letters. Perhaps ""STERN"" could work.\n\nI recall that ""ADIEU"" is sometimes used because it has many vowels, but it misses some consonants, so it might not be as efficient for first guess. Consonants are equally important.\n\nTo balance it, I think ""CRATE"" or ""ROAST"" could be decent. Let me settle on something.\n\nPerhaps the best is to choose a word with no repeating letters to cover more ground. Letters that appear twice in a word give less information if they\'re not in the secret word.\n\nSo, a word like ""SPINE"" – S, P, I, N, E. Not bad.\n\nHow about ""AUDIO""? That\'s mostly vowels but lacks consonants.\n\nI think ""CRANE"" is solid: C, R, A, N, E. That touches upon several common letters.\n\nAnother option is ""SALET"", but that might be less common; I need a valid English word.\n\n""CRANE"" is definitely valid.\n\nSince the feedback was given in the example with ""STORM"", ""BRAVE"", ""BRISK"", but that\'s just an example.\n\nI should just go with a standard opener.\n\nLet me choose ""CRANE"".\n\nAfter this guess, I\'ll get feedback with ✓, -, or x for each position, which will help me narrow down the possibilities.\n\nFor now, I need to output the guess in the specified format.\n\nSo, my step-by-step thought: I\'ve decided to start with ""CRANE"" because it includes common consonants and vowels, giving a good spread of information.I need to make my first guess in this word-guessing game. Since I don\'t have any prior feedback, I should choose a word that maximizes the information gained. This means selecting a 5-letter English word with common vowels and consonants to test a broad range of letters. A good starter word often includes letters like R, S, T, L, N, E, or A, as they appear frequently in English words.\n\nConsidering options:\n- ""ADIEU"" has many vowels but lacks common consonants, potentially yielding less useful data for consonants.\n- ""SLATE"" uses S, L, A, T, E—a solid mix with both vowels and common consonants.\n- ""CRANE"" is a classic first guess because it includes C, R, A, N, E, covering multiple high-frequency letters without repeats.\n\nI\'ll go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess. It contains three vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N), which should help identify correct letters or positions efficiently, no matter what the secret word is. After this, the feedback will guide my next move by showing which letters are correct, present but misplaced, or absent.\n\n<guess>CRANE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Alright, let\'s tackle this step by step. The first guess was ""CRANE,"" and the feedback shows: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x). This means that:\n\n- C is not in the secret word at all.\n- R is not in the secret word.\n- A is present in the word but in the wrong position.\n- N and E are not in the word.\n\nSo, the secret word contains the letter A, but it\'s not in the third position where I guessed it. Since A is somewhere else, and C, R, N, E are absent, I need to choose a new word that includes A but avoids C, R, N, E entirely. Also, since A is not in position 3, it could be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\nNow, considering possible letters for the new guess, I should include A and try other common consonants that haven\'t been ruled out yet. From the first guess, I\'ve eliminated C, R, N, E. Common letters still available include S, T, L, O, U, D, M, P, B, and others. But since A is confirmed present, I should prioritize words that have A in various positions to test its placement.\n\nStarting position possibilities for A: It could be in 1, 2, 4, or 5. To gather more information efficiently, I might pick a word where A is in a different spot than the third. A word with A in position 1 could be ""AUDIO,"" but ""AUDIO"" has U and O, which I haven\'t tested yet. Alternatively, ""PLANT"" has N and T, but N was already ruled out, so that\'s not valid since N is absent.\n\nSince A is misplaced and wasn\'t in position 3, my next word needs to include A somewhere else—like position 1, 2, 4, or 5—and avoid C, R, N, E. Let me think of words with A in different positions. For example:\n\n- Position 1: Words like ""ABOUT,"" ""ALONE,"" ""ADMIT.""\n- Position 2: ""PAINT,"" ""MAIZE,"" but MAIZE has Z which might be less common. ""PAINT"" includes N which is excluded.\n- Position 4: ""TRAIN"" has R which is excluded. ""PLAIN"" has P, L, A, I, N—N is excluded.\n- Position 5: ""MEDIA"" has E and D—E is excluded, so no.\n\nFinding words without C, R, N, E: Letters available—S, T, L, O, U, D, M, P, B, G, H, Y, etc. Possible words with A: ""PLAST,"" but that\'s not a word. Valid words: ""SALTY"" has S, A, L, T, Y. That includes A in position 2, avoids forbidden letters. ""PASTA"" has P, A, S, T, A? Wait, A repeated? But ""PASTA"" has A at positions 2 and 5. It\'s a valid word. However, since I haven\'t tested S, T, P before, this could work.\n\nAnother option: ""SHALT"" but archaic; need common words. ""SLATE"" has E, but E is excluded. So avoid E. ""STAND"" has N—excluded. ""BLEAK"" has E and K? E excluded.\n\nBetter words: ""PATIO"" uses P, A, T, I, O. Avoids C,R,N,E. A is in position 2. ""PIANO"" has O but also N—excluded. No. ""TIPSY"" no A. Must include A.\n\n""OASIS"" has double S and O, A in position 2. But double letters might complicate feedback if S is correct or not. Not ideal for second guess.\n\n""MEDIA"" has E—out. ""ALIGN"" has N—out. ""ABOUT"" is good: A in position 1, B,O,U,T. Letters B,O,U,T haven\'t been tested. Also avoids excluded letters. Similarly, ""ATOMS"" has M,S—T and S are untested. A in position 1.\n\n""PANSY"" has N and S—N is excluded, so invalid. Need no N.\n\nAnother one: ""BLAME"" has E—excluded. Same with ""FLAME,"" etc.\n\n""SALAD"" double A but A is already confirmed present. Still, might be okay. Position 1 and 3? Third position is problematic since A is not there? The feedback said A(-) meaning present but wrong position. Since guessed position 3 was wrong, A cannot be in position 3. So in ""SALAD"", if I guess S,A,L,A,D—positions: A at 2 and 4. Could still work, but repeating letters might give less info if A isn\'t doubled. But secret word might not have two A\'s, so guessing one A is fine.\n\nTo test multiple new letters, I should avoid repeats. So ""ABOUT"" is solid: positions A,B,O,U,T—all untested letters. A at pos 1, B,O,U,T new. Similarly, ""ADOPT"" has A at pos 1, D,O,P,T. Avoids bad letters.\n\n""ADOPT"" has O,P,D,T—common. Could work. ""ABOUT"" has U and O.\n\nAnother good word: ""PLAIT"" P,L,A,I,T? Or ""PILOT"" no A. ""TABLE"" has E—excluded.\n\n""SHAKE"" has E? E excluded. ""CHAIN"" has H and N—N excluded.\n\nConcentrate on avoiding C,R,N,E and including A in not-pos-3.\n\n""BALMY"" B,A,L,M,Y. Y is possible. Or ""SAUCE"" has C? C excluded—C is x, so avoid C.\n\nDon\'t use C.\n\n""MANGO"" has N—no. ""TODAY"" A at end? T,O,D,A,Y—Y possible. A in position 4. Or ""PARTY"" has R—R excluded.\n\nR is absent, so avoid R.\n\n""FOCUS"" has F,O,C,U,S—C excluded. Bad.\n\nValid words without C,R,N,E: A included, say ""TOADY""? Or ""TOAST"" has T,O,A,S,T—S double? ""TOAST"" has T,O,A,S,T—positions 1=T,2=O,3=A,4=S,5=T. But guessed A in position 3? First guess had A in pos 3 and it was marked ""-"", meaning A is present but not in pos 3. So guessing A in pos 3 again might not help directly. If I use ""TOAST"", A is at pos 3, but we already know it\'s not there because of first feedback. So useless to put A there again—better to move it elsewhere to find correct position.\n\nSo, choose a word where A is in position 1,2,4, or 5—ideally a spot I suspect. But since I don\'t know, spread it around.\n\n""ABOUT"" A at 1, B,O,U,T elsewhere. That tests position 1 for A.\n\nOther positions: ""SPLAT"" no E? S,P,L,A,T—A at pos 4. S and T common. But L and P new. ""SPALT"" not word. ""PAINT"" has N—invalid.\n\n""VALID"" V,A,L,I,D—possible, V less common. Maybe too rare.\n\n""GLAZE"" has E—out.\n\nSo perhaps ""ABOUT"" is a safe choice. Or ""ADOPT"".\n\nAnother one: ""AUDIO"" A,U,D,I,O—U,D,I,O new. A at pos 1.\n\nBut ""AUDIO"" uses letters that might be less frequent—U,D,I,O. Whereas ""ABOUT"" has B,O,U,T—B and T are common.\n\nSimilarly, ""MAPLE"" has E—excluded.\n\nI think ""ABOUT"" or ""ADOPT"" are reasonable. Let\'s go with ""ADOPT"" to test D,O,P,T along with A.\n\nCould use ""PLAIT"" P,L,A,I,T—A at pos 3? But first feedback said A not at pos 3, so guessing it there again wastes an opportunity. If A is not at 3, misplacing it again doesn\'t help pinpoint where it is. Better to move it.\n\nTo verify: feedback shows A present but not pos 3. So if I guess A in a new position, say pos 1 in ""ADOPT"", I might get:\n\n- If A is actually at pos 1, I get ✓ for position.\n- If A is at pos 4 or whatever, I get - indicating it\'s elsewhere.\n- But by guessing pos 1, even if wrong, I learn it\'s not there, narrowing to pos 2,4,5.\n\nSimilarly, if I guess pos 2, like in ""SAINT"" but N excluded. Or ""TASTE"" E excluded.\n\nTherefore, ""ADOPT"" seems good—D,O,P,T new letters, A at position 2? No, ""ADOPT"": A-D-O-P-T. Positions: A at 1? Let\'s spell: A at position 1? ADOPT: A is first letter? A-D-O-P-T, so position 1: A, pos 2: D, pos 3: O, pos 4: P, pos 5: T. So A in pos 1.\n\nPerfect. I avoid testing A in known-wrong pos 3.\n\nSo guess: ADOPT? Or ABOUT? Let\'s decide.\n\nAlternatively, ""HAVOC"" H,A,V,O,C—but C excluded, invalid since C is out.\n\nNo.\n\n""CARGO"" C and R excluded.\n\n""PASTA"": P,A,S,T,A—double A. Positions: P at 1, A at 2, S at 3, T at 4, A at 5? But S at 3. First, S is new. But testing A at pos 2 and 5. Since A might not be double, but could.\n\nCompared to ""ADOPT"", which has no duplicates.\n\nI think ""ADOPT"" is fine. \n\nOther: ""BADLY"" B,A,D,L,Y—L and Y untested. Position 2 for A.\n\nCould test different position.\n\nTo maximize letters, ""ABOUT"" has U, which is less common than others? \n\nPerhaps ""SLATE"" but E excluded—invalid.\n\nMust avoid E.\n\n""TOADY"" T,O,A,D,Y—A at pos 3? Again, pos 3 is known wrong for A—should not guess A there. T-O-A-D-Y: A at position 3—exactly where we know it\'s not. So bad guess—I\'d waste information.\n\nSo avoid words with A in position 3.\n\nSimilarly, for ""ADOPT"": A is at 1, not 3. Good.\n\n""DAUNT"" has N—excluded.\n\n""GUILD"" no A.\n\nSo, I\'ll choose ""ABOUT"" because it includes U and O, both vowels, to test.\n\nBut U might be less common. ""ABOUT"" has A,B,O,U,T—letters B,O,U,T new, with A in pos 1.\n\nPossibly ""PLAID"" P,L,A,I,D—D untested. A at pos 3? Position 3—should avoid. P-L-A-I-D: A at pos 3—same issue. Not good.\n\nTherefore, words where A is at 1: ""ABOUT"", ""ADOPT"", ""AUDIO"", ""ATOMS""\n\nA at 2: ""SAINT"" but N excluded; ""GAUDY"" G,A,U,D,Y; or ""FATAL"" but F possibly rare.\n\n""QUALM"" Q maybe too rare.\n\nA at 4: ""OPIUM"" no A? Must include A. ""METAL"" E excluded; ""FOCAL"" C excluded. ""OVARY"" O,V,A,R,Y—R excluded. Bad.\n\nA at 5: ""PIETA"" P,I,E,T,A—E excluded; ""TULIP"" U,L,I,P,T—no A; ""STAIR"" R excluded.\n\nHard to find words with A in position 4 or 5 without excluded letters. Easier to guess A in position 1 or 2.\n\nPosition 2: ""GAUID"" not word; ""SALTY"" A at pos 2? S-A-L-T-Y—yes position 2. S,A,L,T,Y. Letters S,L,T,Y new—all untested. A at position 2.\n\nSimilarly, ""HAPPY"" double P, not ideal.\n\n""SALTY"" sounds good.\n\nMoreover, S,L,T,Y are all common letters. \n\nComparing to ""ABOUT"": U might be less common. ""SALTY"" uses S,L,T—all high-frequency.\n\nPlus, in terms of vowel/consonant mix.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""SALTY"" to test A in position 2 and new letters S,L,T,Y.\n\nSo guess: SALTY.\n\nBut ensure it\'s valid: SALTY is a common word.\n\nAlso, avoids C,R,N,E—all excluded letters.After analyzing the feedback from Guess 1 (""CRANE""):\n- C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- A is in the secret word but not in position 3 (marked ""-"").\n\nBased on this, the secret word contains the letter A, which must appear in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since position 3 is incorrect). Additionally, the new guess must exclude C, R, N, E entirely and include A in one of these other positions to narrow down its location.\n\nTo maximize information, the next guess should:\n1. Include A in a position not tested before (avoid position 3).\n2. Introduce new common letters that haven\'t been eliminated (e.g., S, T, L, B, O, U, D, P).\n3. Avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.\n\nConsidering options:\n- Avoid words with A in position 3 (redundant based on feedback).\n- Position 1 for A: Words like ""ABOUT"" or ""ADOPT"" are possible but may include less frequent letters (e.g., U).\n- Position 2 for A: Words like ""SALTY"" (S, A, L, T, Y) place A in position 2 and use common consonants—making it efficient for testing multiple new letters.\n- Position 4 or 5 for A is harder due to excluded letters (e.g., ""METAL"" invalid due to E). \n\n""SALTY"" is a strong choice:\n- Tests A in position 2 (new position) to determine if it\'s correct or misplaced.\n- Introduces high-frequency letters S, L, T, Y (all untested).\n- Avoids C, R, N, E and doesn\'t repeat letters.\n- If A is not in position 2, the feedback will help eliminate more positions.\n\nThus, ""SALTY"" is selected as the second guess.\n\n<guess>SALTY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: SALTY -> FEEDBACK: S(-) A(✓) L(-) T(x) Y(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
This means:
- C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.

Guess 2: SALTY -> S(-) A(✓) L(-) T(x) Y(x)
This means:
- S is in the word but not in position 1 (because we have S in position 1 and it's marked ""-"", meaning it's present but wrong position).
- A is correct and in the right position: position 2 (since in SALTY, A is the second letter and we have A(✓)).
- L is in the word but not in position 3 (because in SALTY, L is in position 3 and it's marked ""-"").
- T and Y are not in the word at all.

So, from both feedbacks, we know:

Correct letters so far:
- A is in the word and in position 2.

Present but misplaced letters:
- S is in the word, but not in position 1. Since A is in position 2, S cannot be in position 2 either. So S must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- L is in the word, but not in position 3. It could be in position 1, 4, or 5 (but note position 2 is taken by A, so not available).

Absent letters: C, R, N, E, T, Y. So we must avoid these.

Also, from the first guess, we know A is not in position 3, which is consistent because now we have A in position 2.

Now, the secret word has:
- Position 2: A (fixed)
- S is present, but not in 1 or 2, so in 3,4, or 5.
- L is present, but not in 3, and not in 2 (taken), so in 1,4, or 5.

But note: the word has 5 positions. We have two letters that must be placed: S and L, and we know A is in position 2.

Also, we have two more letters to find, which are not among the absent ones.

Let's list the known constraints:
- Position 1: cannot be S (because S is misplaced and not in 1), and cannot be any of the absent letters. Also, L could be here? But L is misplaced and not in 3, so it could be in 1.
- Position 2: A (fixed)
- Position 3: cannot be L (because in SALTY, L was in 3 and marked ""-""), and cannot be S? Not necessarily, because S could be in 3. Also, we don't know about position 3 yet.
- Position 4 and 5: open.

We also know that S and L are in the word, so we must include both in the next guess? Actually, we don't have to, but it's wise to try to confirm their positions.

But note: we have two known present letters (S and L) and one fixed (A). So the word has A in 2, and S and L somewhere else, and two more letters that we haven't guessed yet.

We must avoid: C, R, N, E, T, Y.

Now, for the next guess, we want to try to place S and L in possible positions and also test new letters.

Possible positions for S: 3,4,5
Possible positions for L: 1,4,5

But note: if we put L in position 1, then S can be in 3,4,5. Similarly, if we put S in 3, then L can be in 1,4,5, etc.

We also need to introduce new letters to find the remaining two.

Let's think of words that have:
- Position 2: A
- Include S and L (since they are present, we should include them to test positions)
- Avoid C, R, N, E, T, Y

And we want to test as many positions as possible.

Consider placing S in position 3 and L in position 1? That would be a word like: L A S ? ?

But we need to fill the last two positions with letters not in the absent list.

What letters can we use? We haven't used many yet. Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z (but X and Z are rare, so avoid? We should use common ones).

Also, we must avoid T and Y, which are absent.

So, for the word: L A S ? ?

We need two more letters. Let's think of words: ""LASSO"" but has double S? And O. But we don't know if S is repeated? The feedback doesn't say anything about repeated letters, but the secret word might have repeated letters? However, in our previous guesses, we didn't have repeats, so we don't know.

But to be safe, let's avoid repeats for now to maximize information.

So, no repeated letters.

Possible words: ""LASIK"" (but that's a proper noun? and not common), ""LASUX"" not a word.

""BASIL"": B A S I L -> positions: B at 1, A at 2, S at 3, I at 4, L at 5.

This includes S and L, and A at 2. Also, B and I are new.

But let's check the positions: 
- S is at position 3: we want to test if S is at 3.
- L is at position 5: we want to test if L is at 5.

Also, we avoid absent letters.

Another word: ""PALSY"" but Y is absent, so invalid.

""HAILS"": H A I L S -> H at 1, A at 2, I at 3, L at 4, S at 5.

This has S at 5 and L at 4.

We can also consider placing L at position 1 and S at 4, for example: ""LAPIS"" (a word? meaning a type of gemstone) -> L A P I S: L at 1, A at 2, P at 3, I at 4, S at 5.

But ""LAPIS"" might be considered obscure? We should use common words.

""DAISY"" has D, A, I, S, Y -> but Y is absent, so no.

""MAILS"": M A I L S -> M at 1, A at 2, I at 3, L at 4, S at 5.

Similar to HAILS.

But we have to avoid T and Y, so ""MAILS"" is okay? M, A, I, L, S.

But in ""MAILS"", S is at position 5 and L at 4.

We could test S at position 4 and L at position 1: for example, ""LASSO"" has double S, not good. ""LASTS"" has T and double S, T absent and double.

Not good.

""SAILS"": but S is at position 1, but we know S cannot be at position 1 (from SALTY feedback: S in position 1 was marked ""-"", meaning S is not in 1). So we cannot put S in position 1 again. Similarly, we should avoid putting L in position 3 because we know it's not there.

So, for the next guess, we should not put S in 1 or L in 3.

In ""BASIL"": S is in 3, L in 5. This is okay because we haven't tested S in 3 or L in 5.

Similarly, in ""HAILS"" or ""MAILS"": S in 5, L in 4.

Another possibility: put S in 4 and L in 1: word like ""LASER"" but R and E are absent. Invalid.

""LASED"" E absent.

""BASAL"" has A repeated? B A S A L -> A at 2 and 4? But we know A is at 2, and we don't know if there is another A? But the feedback didn't indicate multiple A's, but it's possible. However, to avoid confusion, let's not repeat A for now.

So, no repeated letters.

Another word: ""GASPS"" has double S and P, but double S.

Not ideal.

""OASIS"" has double S and O, A at 2? O A S I S -> positions: O at 1, A at 2, S at 3, I at 4, S at 5. But S repeated, and we don't know if S is repeated.

But we want to avoid repeats.

So, back to ""BASIL"": B A S I L

This seems a valid and common word.

Similarly, ""RADII"" has R and I? R is absent, so no.

""VALID"" has V, A, L, I, D -> V at 1, A at 2, L at 3? But L cannot be at position 3! Because in SALTY, L was in position 3 and marked ""-"", so L is not in 3. Therefore, we cannot put L in position 3 in the next guess.

In ""BASIL"", L is at position 5, which is fine.

In ""VALID"", L is at position 3, which is forbidden because we know L is not in position 3. So we must avoid that.

Similarly, in any guess, we should not put L in position 3.

For S, we should not put it in position 1.

So, in the next guess:
- Position 1: cannot be S, and cannot be absent letters. It can be L? Yes, because L can be in 1.
- Position 2: A (fixed)
- Position 3: cannot be L, and we don't know about S? S can be in 3, but we are allowed to put S there to test.
- Position 4 and 5: open.

But if we put S in position 3, that's acceptable because we haven't tested S in 3.

Similarly, we can put L in position 1,4, or 5.

Now, let's list possible words:

Option 1: L in position 1, S in position 4: word like L A ? S ? 

For example: ""LAUDS"" but U, D, S. But S is at 4? L A U D S -> positions: L at 1, A at 2, U at 3, D at 4, S at 5? S is at 5, not 4.

We need S at 4: so L A ? S ? 

""LAMPS"" -> L A M P S: M at 3, P at 4, S at 5. S is at 5.

To have S at 4: ""LASSI"" but double S? L A S S I -> S at 3 and 4? Not good.

""LASTS"" has T and double S, invalid.

""LAPSE"" has E, absent.

Hard to find a word with S in position 4.

Similarly, S in position 5 is easier.

Option: S in position 3, L in position 1: word like S ? ? ? ? but S cannot be in position 1, but we can put S in position 3? Yes.

Word: ? A S ? ? and L in position 1: but position 1 is the first letter, so if L is in 1, then word: L A S ? ?

As before, ""LAS"" words: ""LASSO"", ""LASTS"", not good. ""LASKA"" not word. ""LASED"" E absent.

""BASIL"" has B at 1, A at 2, S at 3, I at 4, L at 5. So S at 3 and L at 5.

This is good.

Another word: ""HAILS"" H at 1, A at 2, I at 3, L at 4, S at 5. So S at 5 and L at 4.

Also good.

""MAILS"" same as HAILS but M.

""PAILS"" P at 1, A at 2, I at 3, L at 4, S at 5.

""WAILS"" W at 1, etc.

But in all these, for ""HAILS"" type, L is at 4 and S at 5.

In ""BASIL"", S is at 3 and L at 5.

Which one to choose? We need to test different positions to get more information.

Currently, we don't know if S is in 3,4, or 5, and L in 1,4, or 5.

If we guess ""BASIL"", we are testing:
- S in position 3: if it gets ✓, then S is at 3; if -, then S is in 4 or 5 but not 3; if x, but S is present so it can't be x.
Similarly for L at 5.

But S is present, so it can't be absent, so the feedback for S will be either ✓ or -.

Similarly for L.

If we guess ""HAILS"", we test S at 5 and L at 4.

To maximize the chance of getting a ✓, we might choose a word that has S in a position we think is likely, but we don't have information.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests S in a position that is not tested before, and same for L.

But we have to introduce new letters.

Another idea: we can test L in position 1 and S in position 5, for example.

Word: ""LAMAS"" but A repeated? L A M A S -> A at 2 and 4? But we know A is at 2, and if there is another A? But we don't know. Avoid.

""LOADS"" has O, A, D, S -> L at 1, O at 2? But position 2 is A, fixed. So cannot.

Position 2 is fixed as A, so the word must be ? A ? ? ?

So, for L in position 1: word must be L A ? ? ?

And S must be in one of the last three positions, but not position 3 for L? L is not in 3, but S can be in 3.

So, L A ? ? ? 

We can have:
- L A S ? ?  -> but S at 3? Then we need two more letters. Words: ""LASER"" invalid, ""LASSO"" double S, ""LASTS"" invalid.
- L A ? S ?  -> S at 4, then words: ""LAPSE"" invalid, ""LASSO"" again, ""MASSE"" not common, ""PASSE"" P A S S E -> E absent and double S.
- L A ? ? S  -> S at 5, then words: ""LAUDS"", ""LANDS"" N absent, ""LARDS"" R absent, ""LAMPS"", ""WADIS"" W A D I S -> but W at 1? L must be at 1, so not. We need L at 1.

So ""LAMPS"": L A M P S -> M at 3, P at 4, S at 5. This is valid.

Similarly, ""LAPIS"": L A P I S -> P at 3, I at 4, S at 5. Also valid.

""LARIS"" R absent.

""LAVAS"" A repeated? L A V A S -> A at 2 and 4? Not good.

So, ""LAMPS"" or ""LAPIS"".

But ""LAPIS"" might be less common.

""LAMPS"" is common.

In ""LAMPS"", we have:
- L at position 1: testing if L is at 1.
- A at 2: fixed, so ✓ expected.
- M at 3: new letter.
- P at 4: new letter.
- S at 5: testing if S is at 5.

We also avoid absent letters.

Similarly, ""BASIL"" has B at 1, A at 2, S at 3, I at 4, L at 5.

Now, comparing:

If we choose ""BASIL"":
- We test S at position 3 and L at position 5.
- New letters: B and I.

If we choose ""LAMPS"":
- We test L at position 1 and S at position 5.
- New letters: M and P.

Both are valid.

But note: in ""BASIL"", we are not testing L at position 1, which is a possibility. Similarly, in ""LAMPS"", we are not testing S at position 3.

To get more coverage, we might want to test S in a position that hasn't been tested. S was tested in position 1 (wrong) and not in 3,4,5 yet. Similarly, L was tested in position 3 (wrong) and not in 1,4,5.

In ""BASIL"", we test S in 3 and L in 5.
In ""LAMPS"", we test L in 1 and S in 5.

We could also test S in 4, but it's hard to find a word.

Another word: ""OASAL"" not a word.

""SAVOR"" but S at 1, which is invalid position for S, and we know S not in 1, so we shouldn't put S in 1.

So, let's choose between ""BASIL"" and ""LAMPS"".

Perhaps ""BASIL"" is better because it tests S in 3, which is a position we haven't tested for S, and L in 5, which is new for L.

In ""LAMPS"", we test L in 1 (new) and S in 5 (new).

But we also need to consider the frequency of letters.

Since we have to find two more letters, we should use common letters.

B, I, M, P are all common.

I think both are fine.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has L in position 4 and S in position 3, for example? But S in 3 and L in 4.

Word: ? A S L ? 

For example: ""BASIL"" has L at 5, not 4. ""HAILS"" has L at 4 and S at 5, not S at 3.

To have S at 3 and L at 4: ? A S L ?

Words: ""BASLE"" E absent, ""DASHL"" not word, ""HASLE"" not common.

""CASTL"" not word.

Not easy.

So, I think ""BASIL"" or ""HAILS"" type.

I'll go with ""BASIL"" to test S in position 3.

So, guess: BASIL

But let's confirm the letters: B, A, S, I, L

A at 2, S at 3, L at 5.

And we avoid absent letters.

So, <guess>BASIL</guess>
</think>
### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)  
  - C, R, N, E are **absent** from the secret word.
  - A is **present** but **not in position 3**.
  
- **Guess 2: SALTY** → Feedback: S(-) A(✓) L(-) T(x) Y(x)  
  - S is **present** but **not in position 1** (and not position 2, since A is fixed there).
  - A is **correct and in position 2** (confirmed).
  - L is **present** but **not in position 3**.
  - T and Y are **absent**.

### Key Constraints for the Next Guess
1. **Fixed position**: Position 2 must be **A**.
2. **Present letters to place**:
   - S must be in the word but **not in position 1 or 2**. Possible positions: 3, 4, or 5.
   - L must be in the word but **not in position 3**. Possible positions: 1, 4, or 5 (position 2 is taken by A).
3. **Absent letters to avoid**: C, R, N, E, T, Y (cannot appear in the word).
4. **New letters needed**: The secret word has 5 letters. We know A (position 2), S, and L are present, so we need to test two new letters for the remaining positions.
5. **Positional testing**: Prioritize testing S and L in new positions to narrow down their locations (e.g., S not tested in 3/4/5 yet; L not tested in 1/4/5).

### Strategy for Guess 3
- **Goal**: Test S in position 3 and L in position 5 (both untested positions) while introducing new common letters (e.g., B, I) to cover more ground.
- **Word choice**: ""BASIL"" fits perfectly:
  - B (new letter) in position 1.
  - A (fixed) in position 2.
  - S (present) in position 3 (testing if S is correct here).
  - I (new letter) in position 4.
  - L (present) in position 5 (testing if L is correct here).
- **Why ""BASIL""?**
  - Avoids all absent letters (C, R, N, E, T, Y).
  - Tests S in position 3: If ✓, S is confirmed; if -, S is in 4 or 5.
  - Tests L in position 5: If ✓, L is confirmed; if -, L is in 1 or 4.
  - Introduces B and I (common letters) to check for presence.
  - No repeated letters, maximizing information gain.

<guess>BASIL</guess>",BASIL,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
This means:
- C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.

Guess 2: SALTY -> S(-) A(✓) L(-) T(x) Y(x)
This means:
- S is in the word but not in position 1 (because we have S in position 1 and it's marked ""-"", meaning it's present but wrong position).
- A is correct and in the right position: position 2 (since in SALTY, A is the second letter and we have A(✓)).
- L is in the word but not in position 3 (because in SALTY, L is in position 3 and it's marked ""-"").
- T and Y are not in the word at all.

So, from both feedbacks, we know:

Correct letters so far:
- A is in the word and in position 2.

Present but misplaced letters:
- S is in the word, but not in position 1. Since A is in position 2, S cannot be in position 2 either. So S must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- L is in the word, but not in position 3. It could be in position 1, 4, or 5 (but note position 2 is taken by A, so not available).

Absent letters: C, R, N, E, T, Y. So we must avoid these.

Also, from the first guess, we know A is not in position 3, which is consistent because now we have A in position 2.

Now, the secret word has:
- Position 2: A (fixed)
- S is present, but not in 1 or 2, so in 3,4, or 5.
- L is present, but not in 3, and not in 2 (taken), so in 1,4, or 5.

But note: the word has 5 positions. We have two letters that must be placed: S and L, and we know A is in position 2.

Also, we have two more letters to find, which are not among the absent ones.

Let's list the known constraints:
- Position 1: cannot be S (because S is misplaced and not in 1), and cannot be any of the absent letters. Also, L could be here? But L is misplaced and not in 3, so it could be in 1.
- Position 2: A (fixed)
- Position 3: cannot be L (because in SALTY, L was in 3 and marked ""-""), and cannot be S? Not necessarily, because S could be in 3. Also, we don't know about position 3 yet.
- Position 4 and 5: open.

We also know that S and L are in the word, so we must include both in the next guess? Actually, we don't have to, but it's wise to try to confirm their positions.

But note: we have two known present letters (S and L) and one fixed (A). So the word has A in 2, and S and L somewhere else, and two more letters that we haven't guessed yet.

We must avoid: C, R, N, E, T, Y.

Now, for the next guess, we want to try to place S and L in possible positions and also test new letters.

Possible positions for S: 3,4,5
Possible positions for L: 1,4,5

But note: if we put L in position 1, then S can be in 3,4,5. Similarly, if we put S in 3, then L can be in 1,4,5, etc.

We also need to introduce new letters to find the remaining two.

Let's think of words that have:
- Position 2: A
- Include S and L (since they are present, we should include them to test positions)
- Avoid C, R, N, E, T, Y

And we want to test as many positions as possible.

Consider placing S in position 3 and L in position 1? That would be a word like: L A S ? ?

But we need to fill the last two positions with letters not in the absent list.

What letters can we use? We haven't used many yet. Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z (but X and Z are rare, so avoid? We should use common ones).

Also, we must avoid T and Y, which are absent.

So, for the word: L A S ? ?

We need two more letters. Let's think of words: ""LASSO"" but has double S? And O. But we don't know if S is repeated? The feedback doesn't say anything about repeated letters, but the secret word might have repeated letters? However, in our previous guesses, we didn't have repeats, so we don't know.

But to be safe, let's avoid repeats for now to maximize information.

So, no repeated letters.

Possible words: ""LASIK"" (but that's a proper noun? and not common), ""LASUX"" not a word.

""BASIL"": B A S I L -> positions: B at 1, A at 2, S at 3, I at 4, L at 5.

This includes S and L, and A at 2. Also, B and I are new.

But let's check the positions: 
- S is at position 3: we want to test if S is at 3.
- L is at position 5: we want to test if L is at 5.

Also, we avoid absent letters.

Another word: ""PALSY"" but Y is absent, so invalid.

""HAILS"": H A I L S -> H at 1, A at 2, I at 3, L at 4, S at 5.

This has S at 5 and L at 4.

We can also consider placing L at position 1 and S at 4, for example: ""LAPIS"" (a word? meaning a type of gemstone) -> L A P I S: L at 1, A at 2, P at 3, I at 4, S at 5.

But ""LAPIS"" might be considered obscure? We should use common words.

""DAISY"" has D, A, I, S, Y -> but Y is absent, so no.

""MAILS"": M A I L S -> M at 1, A at 2, I at 3, L at 4, S at 5.

Similar to HAILS.

But we have to avoid T and Y, so ""MAILS"" is okay? M, A, I, L, S.

But in ""MAILS"", S is at position 5 and L at 4.

We could test S at position 4 and L at position 1: for example, ""LASSO"" has double S, not good. ""LASTS"" has T and double S, T absent and double.

Not good.

""SAILS"": but S is at position 1, but we know S cannot be at position 1 (from SALTY feedback: S in position 1 was marked ""-"", meaning S is not in 1). So we cannot put S in position 1 again. Similarly, we should avoid putting L in position 3 because we know it's not there.

So, for the next guess, we should not put S in 1 or L in 3.

In ""BASIL"": S is in 3, L in 5. This is okay because we haven't tested S in 3 or L in 5.

Similarly, in ""HAILS"" or ""MAILS"": S in 5, L in 4.

Another possibility: put S in 4 and L in 1: word like ""LASER"" but R and E are absent. Invalid.

""LASED"" E absent.

""BASAL"" has A repeated? B A S A L -> A at 2 and 4? But we know A is at 2, and we don't know if there is another A? But the feedback didn't indicate multiple A's, but it's possible. However, to avoid confusion, let's not repeat A for now.

So, no repeated letters.

Another word: ""GASPS"" has double S and P, but double S.

Not ideal.

""OASIS"" has double S and O, A at 2? O A S I S -> positions: O at 1, A at 2, S at 3, I at 4, S at 5. But S repeated, and we don't know if S is repeated.

But we want to avoid repeats.

So, back to ""BASIL"": B A S I L

This seems a valid and common word.

Similarly, ""RADII"" has R and I? R is absent, so no.

""VALID"" has V, A, L, I, D -> V at 1, A at 2, L at 3? But L cannot be at position 3! Because in SALTY, L was in position 3 and marked ""-"", so L is not in 3. Therefore, we cannot put L in position 3 in the next guess.

In ""BASIL"", L is at position 5, which is fine.

In ""VALID"", L is at position 3, which is forbidden because we know L is not in position 3. So we must avoid that.

Similarly, in any guess, we should not put L in position 3.

For S, we should not put it in position 1.

So, in the next guess:
- Position 1: cannot be S, and cannot be absent letters. It can be L? Yes, because L can be in 1.
- Position 2: A (fixed)
- Position 3: cannot be L, and we don't know about S? S can be in 3, but we are allowed to put S there to test.
- Position 4 and 5: open.

But if we put S in position 3, that's acceptable because we haven't tested S in 3.

Similarly, we can put L in position 1,4, or 5.

Now, let's list possible words:

Option 1: L in position 1, S in position 4: word like L A ? S ? 

For example: ""LAUDS"" but U, D, S. But S is at 4? L A U D S -> positions: L at 1, A at 2, U at 3, D at 4, S at 5? S is at 5, not 4.

We need S at 4: so L A ? S ? 

""LAMPS"" -> L A M P S: M at 3, P at 4, S at 5. S is at 5.

To have S at 4: ""LASSI"" but double S? L A S S I -> S at 3 and 4? Not good.

""LASTS"" has T and double S, invalid.

""LAPSE"" has E, absent.

Hard to find a word with S in position 4.

Similarly, S in position 5 is easier.

Option: S in position 3, L in position 1: word like S ? ? ? ? but S cannot be in position 1, but we can put S in position 3? Yes.

Word: ? A S ? ? and L in position 1: but position 1 is the first letter, so if L is in 1, then word: L A S ? ?

As before, ""LAS"" words: ""LASSO"", ""LASTS"", not good. ""LASKA"" not word. ""LASED"" E absent.

""BASIL"" has B at 1, A at 2, S at 3, I at 4, L at 5. So S at 3 and L at 5.

This is good.

Another word: ""HAILS"" H at 1, A at 2, I at 3, L at 4, S at 5. So S at 5 and L at 4.

Also good.

""MAILS"" same as HAILS but M.

""PAILS"" P at 1, A at 2, I at 3, L at 4, S at 5.

""WAILS"" W at 1, etc.

But in all these, for ""HAILS"" type, L is at 4 and S at 5.

In ""BASIL"", S is at 3 and L at 5.

Which one to choose? We need to test different positions to get more information.

Currently, we don't know if S is in 3,4, or 5, and L in 1,4, or 5.

If we guess ""BASIL"", we are testing:
- S in position 3: if it gets ✓, then S is at 3; if -, then S is in 4 or 5 but not 3; if x, but S is present so it can't be x.
Similarly for L at 5.

But S is present, so it can't be absent, so the feedback for S will be either ✓ or -.

Similarly for L.

If we guess ""HAILS"", we test S at 5 and L at 4.

To maximize the chance of getting a ✓, we might choose a word that has S in a position we think is likely, but we don't have information.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests S in a position that is not tested before, and same for L.

But we have to introduce new letters.

Another idea: we can test L in position 1 and S in position 5, for example.

Word: ""LAMAS"" but A repeated? L A M A S -> A at 2 and 4? But we know A is at 2, and if there is another A? But we don't know. Avoid.

""LOADS"" has O, A, D, S -> L at 1, O at 2? But position 2 is A, fixed. So cannot.

Position 2 is fixed as A, so the word must be ? A ? ? ?

So, for L in position 1: word must be L A ? ? ?

And S must be in one of the last three positions, but not position 3 for L? L is not in 3, but S can be in 3.

So, L A ? ? ? 

We can have:
- L A S ? ?  -> but S at 3? Then we need two more letters. Words: ""LASER"" invalid, ""LASSO"" double S, ""LASTS"" invalid.
- L A ? S ?  -> S at 4, then words: ""LAPSE"" invalid, ""LASSO"" again, ""MASSE"" not common, ""PASSE"" P A S S E -> E absent and double S.
- L A ? ? S  -> S at 5, then words: ""LAUDS"", ""LANDS"" N absent, ""LARDS"" R absent, ""LAMPS"", ""WADIS"" W A D I S -> but W at 1? L must be at 1, so not. We need L at 1.

So ""LAMPS"": L A M P S -> M at 3, P at 4, S at 5. This is valid.

Similarly, ""LAPIS"": L A P I S -> P at 3, I at 4, S at 5. Also valid.

""LARIS"" R absent.

""LAVAS"" A repeated? L A V A S -> A at 2 and 4? Not good.

So, ""LAMPS"" or ""LAPIS"".

But ""LAPIS"" might be less common.

""LAMPS"" is common.

In ""LAMPS"", we have:
- L at position 1: testing if L is at 1.
- A at 2: fixed, so ✓ expected.
- M at 3: new letter.
- P at 4: new letter.
- S at 5: testing if S is at 5.

We also avoid absent letters.

Similarly, ""BASIL"" has B at 1, A at 2, S at 3, I at 4, L at 5.

Now, comparing:

If we choose ""BASIL"":
- We test S at position 3 and L at position 5.
- New letters: B and I.

If we choose ""LAMPS"":
- We test L at position 1 and S at position 5.
- New letters: M and P.

Both are valid.

But note: in ""BASIL"", we are not testing L at position 1, which is a possibility. Similarly, in ""LAMPS"", we are not testing S at position 3.

To get more coverage, we might want to test S in a position that hasn't been tested. S was tested in position 1 (wrong) and not in 3,4,5 yet. Similarly, L was tested in position 3 (wrong) and not in 1,4,5.

In ""BASIL"", we test S in 3 and L in 5.
In ""LAMPS"", we test L in 1 and S in 5.

We could also test S in 4, but it's hard to find a word.

Another word: ""OASAL"" not a word.

""SAVOR"" but S at 1, which is invalid position for S, and we know S not in 1, so we shouldn't put S in 1.

So, let's choose between ""BASIL"" and ""LAMPS"".

Perhaps ""BASIL"" is better because it tests S in 3, which is a position we haven't tested for S, and L in 5, which is new for L.

In ""LAMPS"", we test L in 1 (new) and S in 5 (new).

But we also need to consider the frequency of letters.

Since we have to find two more letters, we should use common letters.

B, I, M, P are all common.

I think both are fine.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has L in position 4 and S in position 3, for example? But S in 3 and L in 4.

Word: ? A S L ? 

For example: ""BASIL"" has L at 5, not 4. ""HAILS"" has L at 4 and S at 5, not S at 3.

To have S at 3 and L at 4: ? A S L ?

Words: ""BASLE"" E absent, ""DASHL"" not word, ""HASLE"" not common.

""CASTL"" not word.

Not easy.

So, I think ""BASIL"" or ""HAILS"" type.

I'll go with ""BASIL"" to test S in position 3.

So, guess: BASIL

But let's confirm the letters: B, A, S, I, L

A at 2, S at 3, L at 5.

And we avoid absent letters.

So, <guess>BASIL</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)  
  - C, R, N, E are **absent** from the secret word.
  - A is **present** but **not in position 3**.
  
- **Guess 2: SALTY** → Feedback: S(-) A(✓) L(-) T(x) Y(x)  
  - S is **present** but **not in position 1** (and not position 2, since A is fixed there).
  - A is **correct and in position 2** (confirmed).
  - L is **present** but **not in position 3**.
  - T and Y are **absent**.

### Key Constraints for the Next Guess
1. **Fixed position**: Position 2 must be **A**.
2. **Present letters to place**:
   - S must be in the word but **not in position 1 or 2**. Possible positions: 3, 4, or 5.
   - L must be in the word but **not in position 3**. Possible positions: 1, 4, or 5 (position 2 is taken by A).
3. **Absent letters to avoid**: C, R, N, E, T, Y (cannot appear in the word).
4. **New letters needed**: The secret word has 5 letters. We know A (position 2), S, and L are present, so we need to test two new letters for the remaining positions.
5. **Positional testing**: Prioritize testing S and L in new positions to narrow down their locations (e.g., S not tested in 3/4/5 yet; L not tested in 1/4/5).

### Strategy for Guess 3
- **Goal**: Test S in position 3 and L in position 5 (both untested positions) while introducing new common letters (e.g., B, I) to cover more ground.
- **Word choice**: ""BASIL"" fits perfectly:
  - B (new letter) in position 1.
  - A (fixed) in position 2.
  - S (present) in position 3 (testing if S is correct here).
  - I (new letter) in position 4.
  - L (present) in position 5 (testing if L is correct here).
- **Why ""BASIL""?**
  - Avoids all absent letters (C, R, N, E, T, Y).
  - Tests S in position 3: If ✓, S is confirmed; if -, S is in 4 or 5.
  - Tests L in position 5: If ✓, L is confirmed; if -, L is in 1 or 4.
  - Introduces B and I (common letters) to check for presence.
  - No repeated letters, maximizing information gain.",Guess 3: BASIL -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) A(✓) S(✓) I(✓) L(✓),SUCCESS
