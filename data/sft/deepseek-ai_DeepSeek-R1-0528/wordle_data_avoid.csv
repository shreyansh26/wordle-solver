We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all are distinct.

 So, our first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
C: x (not in the word)
R: x (not in the word)
A: - (in the word but wrong position)
N: x (not in the word)
E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since we had it in the third position and it's marked as wrong position).
- The letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, but not C, R, N, E.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Includes the letter A (since we know it's in the word) and put it in a different position to test.
- Avoids the letters C, R, N, E (since they are not in the word).
- Includes other common letters to maximize information.

Possible positions for A: Since it was in position 3 and was wrong, we can try positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We also want to cover as many new letters as possible.

Common letters in 5-letter words (excluding C, R, N, E): S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, B, G, etc.

Let's try to form a word that has A and some of these common letters.

One common starting word that avoids the excluded letters is ""SALAD"", but that has two A's and we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we have limited information, so we might avoid duplicates for now.

Another idea: ""PLAIT"" but that has T and I, which are common.

But note: we have only 6 tries, so we need to be efficient.

Alternatively, we can try ""SLATE"" but E is excluded, so we cannot use E.

We must avoid E, C, R, N.

Let me think of words with A and without C, R, N, E.

Some options:
- ""SAULT"" (but not common, and U is less common)
- ""SALTY"": S, A, L, T, Y -> avoids the excluded letters. And A is in position 2 (different from the first guess where it was in position 3).

But we don't know if Y is in the word. However, we are trying to get information.

Another common word: ""PASTA"" -> P, A, S, T, A. But it has two A's. We don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we are using A twice, which might not be efficient for information.

Alternatively, ""PASTY"" (a pastry) but again, Y.

We can try ""PLAIT"": P, L, A, I, T. This has A in position 3 again? But we know A is not in position 3? Actually, no: the feedback only said that A is in the word but not in position 3. It could be in other positions. But we can try it in a different position to get more information.

In ""PLAIT"", A is in position 3? Let's spell: P-L-A-I-T -> so A is in position 3. But we already know that A is not in position 3 (from the first guess). So if we put A in position 3 again, we might not get new information about the position. So we should avoid putting A in position 3.

Therefore, we should try A in a new position: 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Let me try to form a word with A in position 2: for example, ""SALTY"" (S, A, L, T, Y) or ""BALMY"" (B, A, L, M, Y) but Y is less common.

Another idea: ""TALON"" but N is excluded.

We cannot use N.

So, without N: ""TALUS"" (geological term) or ""HALOS"" but H and O.

We need a common word.

How about ""STAMP"": S, T, A, M, P. A is in position 3? S(1), T(2), A(3) -> but we know A is not in position 3. So we avoid that.

We want A in a different position. Let's put A in position 1: ""ADIEU"" but E and U? E is excluded, so no.

A in position 1 without E: ""AUDIO"" -> A, U, D, I, O. This avoids the excluded letters (C, R, N, E). And it has common vowels and consonants.

But we know A is in the word, and we are putting it in position 1. If the secret word has A in position 1, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and we know it's not in position 1.

Also, we get information about U, D, I, O.

Alternatively, A in position 4: for example, ""BLASP"" is not a word. ""TOPAZ"" -> T, O, P, A, Z. A is in position 4. This is a valid word.

But Z is not very common.

Another word: ""FOCAL"" but F, O, C, A, L -> but C is excluded. We cannot use C.

We must avoid C, R, N, E.

So, ""AUDIO"" seems good: A (position 1), U (2), D (3), I (4), O (5). All distinct and common letters.

But note: we are using A in position 1, which we haven't tried before. We know A is in the word but not in position 3, so it could be in 1,2,4,5.

If we use ""AUDIO"", we test A in position 1 and also test U, D, I, O.

If A is in position 1, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and we know it's not in position 1, and then we have three other positions to try.

Also, if any of U, D, I, O are in the word, we get information.

So, I think ""AUDIO"" is a good second guess.

But let me confirm: the word ""AUDIO"" is a valid English word (meaning sound, especially recorded or transmitted).

So, I'll go with ""AUDIO"".

But wait: what if the secret word has two A's? We don't know. But we are only using one A, which is acceptable.

Alternatively, we could use a word with A in position 2, like ""PAUSE"" but E is excluded. So no.

""MANGO"" has M, A, N, G, O -> but N is excluded. So no.

""LATIN"" has N -> excluded.

So, ""AUDIO"" seems a solid choice.

Therefore, our second guess is ""AUDIO"".

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word (marked with x).
- A is in the word but not in the third position (marked with -).

Key insights:
- The secret word contains the letter A, but not in position 3.
- Avoid using C, R, N, E in the next guess.
- Focus on testing A in a new position (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5) and include other common letters to gather more information.

Also, we have limited information, so we might avoid duplicates for now.\n\nAnother idea: ""PLAIT"" but that has T and I, which are common.\n\nBut note: we have only 6 tries, so we need to be efficient.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""SLATE"" but E is excluded, so we cannot use E.\n\nWe must avoid E, C, R, N.\n\nLet me think of words with A and without C, R, N, E.\n\nSome options:\n- ""SAULT"" (but not common, and U is less common)\n- ""SALTY"": S, A, L, T, Y -> avoids the excluded letters. And A is in position 2 (different from the first guess where it was in position 3).\n\nBut we don\'t know if Y is in the word. However, we are trying to get information.\n\nAnother common word: ""PASTA"" -> P, A, S, T, A. But it has two A\'s. We don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. Also, we are using A twice, which might not be efficient for information.\n\nAlternatively, ""PASTY"" (a pastry) but again, Y.\n\nWe can try ""PLAIT"": P, L, A, I, T. This has A in position 3 again? But we know A is not in position 3? Actually, no: the feedback only said that A is in the word but not in position 3. It could be in other positions. But we can try it in a different position to get more information.\n\nIn ""PLAIT"", A is in position 3? Let\'s spell: P-L-A-I-T -> so A is in position 3. But we already know that A is not in position 3 (from the first guess). So if we put A in position 3 again, we might not get new information about the position. So we should avoid putting A in position 3.\n\nTherefore, we should try A in a new position: 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\nLet me try to form a word with A in position 2: for example, ""SALTY"" (S, A, L, T, Y) or ""BALMY"" (B, A, L, M, Y) but Y is less common.\n\nAnother idea: ""TALON"" but N is excluded.\n\nWe cannot use N.\n\nSo, without N: ""TALUS"" (geological term) or ""HALOS"" but H and O.\n\nWe need a common word.\n\nHow about ""STAMP"": S, T, A, M, P. A is in position 3? S(1), T(2), A(3) -> but we know A is not in position 3. So we avoid that.\n\nWe want A in a different position. Let\'s put A in position 1: ""ADIEU"" but E and U? E is excluded, so no.\n\nA in position 1 without E: ""AUDIO"" -> A, U, D, I, O. This avoids the excluded letters (C, R, N, E). And it has common vowels and consonants.\n\nBut we know A is in the word, and we are putting it in position 1. If the secret word has A in position 1, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and we know it\'s not in position 1.\n\nAlso, we get information about U, D, I, O.\n\nAlternatively, A in position 4: for example, ""BLASP"" is not a word. ""TOPAZ"" -> T, O, P, A, Z. A is in position 4. This is a valid word.\n\nBut Z is not very common.\n\nAnother word: ""FOCAL"" but F, O, C, A, L -> but C is excluded. We cannot use C.\n\nWe must avoid C, R, N, E.\n\nSo, ""AUDIO"" seems good: A (position 1), U (2), D (3), I (4), O (5). All distinct and common letters.\n\nBut note: we are using A in position 1, which we haven\'t tried before. We know A is in the word but not in position 3, so it could be in 1,2,4,5.\n\nIf we use ""AUDIO"", we test A in position 1 and also test U, D, I, O.\n\nIf A is in position 1, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and we know it\'s not in position 1, and then we have three other positions to try.\n\nAlso, if any of U, D, I, O are in the word, we get information.\n\nSo, I think ""AUDIO"" is a good second guess.\n\nBut let me confirm: the word ""AUDIO"" is a valid English word (meaning sound, especially recorded or transmitted).\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""AUDIO"".\n\nBut wait: what if the secret word has two A\'s? We don\'t know. But we are only using one A, which is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, we could use a word with A in position 2, like ""PAUSE"" but E is excluded. So no.\n\n""MANGO"" has M, A, N, G, O -> but N is excluded. So no.\n\n""LATIN"" has N -> excluded.\n\nSo, ""AUDIO"" seems a solid choice.\n\nTherefore, our second guess is ""AUDIO"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word (marked with x).\n- A is in the word but not in the third position (marked with -).\n\nKey insights:\n- The secret word contains the letter A, but not in position 3.\n- Avoid using C, R, N, E in the next guess.\n- Focus on testing A in a new position (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5) and include other common letters to gather more information.\n\nFor the second guess, ""audio"" is chosen because:\n- It places A in position 1 (a new position to test).\n- It introduces new common letters (U, D, I, O) that haven\'t been tried yet.\n- It avoids the excluded letters (C, R, N, E).\n- All letters are distinct, maximizing information potential.\n\n<guess>audio</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: audio -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) U(x) D(-) I(✓) O(-)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- C, R, N, E are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.

Guess 2: ""audio"" -> A(✓), U(x), D(-), I(✓), O(-)
Meaning:
- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- U is not in the word.
- D is in the word but not in position 3.
- I is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- O is in the word but not in position 5.

So, from the feedback, we know:

1. The first letter is A (since A is correct in position 1).
2. The fourth letter is I (since I is correct in position 4).
3. The word contains D and O, but:
   - D is not in position 3 (since in ""audio"" it was in position 3 and got a minus).
   - O is not in position 5 (since in ""audio"" it was in position 5 and got a minus).
4. The letters C, R, N, E, U are not in the word.

Also, we know from the first guess that A is in the word (now confirmed at position 1) and that it is not in position 3 (which is consistent).

So the secret word has the form: A _ _ I _

We also know that D and O are in the word, but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively.

Since D is in the word but not in position 3, and O is in the word but not in position 5, they must be in one of the remaining positions: 2, 3, or 5 for D, and 2, 3, or 4 for O. But note position 4 is already taken by I, so O cannot be in position 4. Therefore, O must be in position 2 or 3.

Similarly, D cannot be in position 3 (from the feedback of ""audio""), so D must be in position 2 or 5.

But note: the word has only 5 letters, and we have:

Position 1: A
Position 2: unknown
Position 3: unknown
Position 4: I
Position 5: unknown

We know the word contains D and O, and one more letter (since we have 5 letters and we already have A, I, D, O, but D and O are two additional letters, so the fifth letter is unknown).

Actually, the word must contain at least A, I, D, O. But we don't know if there are duplicate letters. However, so far we have no indication of duplicates.

So, the secret word is A, ?, ?, I, ? and the letters to fill are two positions (2,3,5) with the letters D, O, and one more letter (since we have three positions and two known letters D and O, but we need three letters for positions 2,3,5). Therefore, there must be one more letter that we haven't guessed yet.

We have:
- Known present letters: A, I, D, O.
- We have three positions to fill: 2, 3, 5.

But we have two known letters (D and O) that must be placed in two of these three positions, and one more letter that we don't know.

So, we need to find a word of the form A _ _ I _ that includes D and O, and one more letter (which is not C, R, N, E, U, and also not A, I, D, O because we already have them? But note, A and I are already placed, so they are fixed. The remaining positions must be filled with D, O, and one new letter.

But wait: the word must contain D and O, but they might be in the remaining positions. However, we have three positions and two letters, so we need one more letter that is in the word.

Therefore, the secret word has exactly five distinct letters? Not necessarily, but we don't have evidence of duplicates. So we assume no duplicates for now.

So, we need to guess a word that:
- Starts with A, ends with I in the fourth position? Actually, the fourth position is I, so the word is A _ _ I _.

Specifically: 
Position 1: A
Position 2: ? (must be one of D, O, or a new letter)
Position 3: ? (must be one of D, O, or a new letter)
Position 4: I
Position 5: ? (must be one of D, O, or a new letter)

But we know that D and O are in the word, so they must occupy two of these three positions.

Also, we know:
- D cannot be in position 3 (from ""audio"" feedback: D was in position 3 and got minus, so it's present but not there).
- O cannot be in position 5 (from ""audio"" feedback: O was in position 5 and got minus, so it's present but not there).

So, for D: it can be in position 2 or 5.
For O: it can be in position 2 or 3.

But note: position 2 and 3 are available for both, but they cannot both be in the same position.

We have two possibilities for the placement of D and O:

Option 1: D in position 2, then O must be in position 3 (because if D is in 2, then O cannot be in 2, so O must be in 3, and then position 5 is a new letter).

Option 2: D in position 5, then O can be in position 2 or 3.

But if D is in position 5, then O can be in 2 or 3, and the remaining position (3 or 2) is a new letter.

Similarly, if D is in position 2 and O in position 3, then position 5 is a new letter.

We also have the constraint that the new letter must not be C, R, N, E, U.

Now, we need to make a third guess. We want to test these possibilities.

We should try to form a word that fits the pattern and tests the possible placements.

We know the word must have A in 1, I in 4, and include D and O.

Let's list possible words that fit A _ _ I _ and have D and O.

But we don't know the fifth letter, so we need to guess a word that can give us information.

We can try to use a word that has D and O in the positions we want to test, and a new letter that is common.

For example, if we try to put D in position 2 and O in position 3: then the word would be A D O I ?. But we need a valid word. What word is A D O I *? For example, ""ADIOS"" but S is a possible letter, and we haven't excluded S. However, ""ADIOS"" has O in position 3 and D in position 2? A-D-I-O-S -> that's positions: 1:A, 2:D, 3:I, 4:O, 5:S. But in our case, position 4 must be I, so that doesn't work because in ""ADIOS"", the fourth letter is O, not I.

We need the fourth letter to be I. So the word must be A _ _ I _.

So, if we put D in position 2 and O in position 3: then we have A D O I ?. What letter can be in position 5? We need a word that ends with I and then the fifth letter? Actually, the word is A, D, O, I, and then the fifth letter. So it would be ""ADOI?"".

Is ""ADOIX"" a word? We need a real word. Let's think: ""ADOPT"" but that has P and T, and the fourth letter is P, not I.

We need the fourth letter to be I. So the word must be A _ _ I _.

Common words: 
- ""AUDIO"" we already tried, but that had U and we know U is not in the word.
- ""AVOID"": A, V, O, I, D -> positions: 1:A, 2:V, 3:O, 4:I, 5:D.

This word ""AVOID"" has:
- A in 1: correct (we know A is in 1)
- V: unknown
- O in 3: we know O is in the word, but we don't know if it's in position 3? We are testing.
- I in 4: correct (we know I is in 4)
- D in 5: we know D is in the word, but we don't know if it's in position 5.

Also, we haven't used V before, so it might be in the word or not.

But note: in ""AVOID"", we have O in position 3 and D in position 5.

Now, from our earlier constraints:
- O cannot be in position 5 (from ""audio"" feedback: O was in 5 and got minus, so it's not in 5). Therefore, if we put D in position 5, that is allowed because D was not in position 5 in the previous guess? The constraint for D is that it cannot be in position 3, but position 5 is allowed.

Similarly, O cannot be in position 5, but in ""AVOID"" it is in position 3, which is allowed because we only know it's not in 5.

So, ""AVOID"" is a candidate for our guess.

But we don't know if V is in the word. If we guess ""AVOID"", we can get feedback on V, O in position 3, and D in position 5.

Alternatively, we could try a word that puts O in position 2 and D in position 5, for example.

But let's see: if we put O in position 2, then the word would be A O ? I ?. And we need to put D somewhere. D cannot be in position 3, so it must be in position 5. Then the word would be A O ? I D. So the third position is a new letter.

What word is A O ? I D? For example, ""AVOID"" is A V O I D -> that's A, V, O, I, D. So that's the same as above? No: in ""AVOID"", the second letter is V, third is O, fourth is I, fifth is D. So if we want O in position 2, we need a word like A O _ I _. For example, ""AORTA"" but that has R (excluded) and T, and the fourth letter is T, not I.

Another example: ""AORTA"" is not valid because of R and no I in fourth.

""ABOIL"": A, B, O, I, L -> that's A, B, O, I, L. So second letter B, third O, fourth I, fifth L. But we want O in second? That would be A, O, then the third letter, then I, then D? We don't have D in that word.

We need to include D. So if we want O in position 2 and D in position 5, we need a word: A O X I D, where X is a letter that makes a word.

Is there a word ""AOVID""? Not a word. ""AODID""? Not a word.

So, it's hard to form a word with O in position 2 and D in position 5.

Another possibility: O in position 2 and D in position 3? But D cannot be in position 3 (from feedback). So that's not allowed.

Therefore, the only possibilities for D and O are:
- D in position 2 and O in position 3 -> word: A D O I ? (and we need a fifth letter)
- D in position 5 and O in position 2 -> but we couldn't find a word for O in 2 and D in 5? Actually, we can have O in position 2 and D in position 5, but we need a letter for position 3. So the word would be A O X I D. What words are there? I can't think of any common word. ""AOXID"" is not a word. ""AODID"" not a word. ""AVID"" is four letters. So probably not.

Alternatively, D in position 5 and O in position 3: then the word is A ? O I D. So second letter is a new letter. For example, ""ALOID"" (which means resembling fat) but that's A, L, O, I, D. So second letter L, third O, fourth I, fifth D. That's a valid word? I think ""ALOID"" is a word, but it's rare.

More common: ""AVOID"" is a common word, which has O in 3 and D in 5.

So, the two main possibilities are:
1. D in 2, O in 3: then word is A D O I ? (fifth letter needed, say X)
2. O in 3, D in 5: then word is A ? O I D (second letter needed, say Y)

We can test one of these.

We can guess ""AVOID"" to test the second possibility: if ""AVOID"" is the word, we win. If not, we get feedback.

In ""AVOID"", we have:
- A: should be correct (position 1)
- V: unknown, we'll see
- O: in position 3, we know O is in the word, but we don't know if it's in 3
- I: correct (position 4)
- D: in position 5, we know D is in the word, but we don't know if it's in 5

If we guess ""AVOID"", the feedback will tell us:
- If V is in the word and in the correct position? But we don't know if V is in the word.
- Also, it will tell us if O is in position 3 and if D is in position 5.

But note: if the secret word is not ""AVOID"", we still get information.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests the other possibility (D in 2 and O in 3) but we need a fifth letter. What word has A, D, O, I, and one more letter? For example, ""ADMIN"" but N is excluded. ""ADOPT"" has P and T, but fourth letter is P, not I. ""ADORE"" has E and R, excluded. ""ADIOS"" has S, but fourth letter is O, not I.

I cannot find a common word with A, D, O, I and a fifth letter that is not excluded, and with the pattern A D O I ?.

So, perhaps the second possibility (O in 3 and D in 5) is more likely, and ""AVOID"" is a good guess.

But we must consider that there might be other letters. For example, the fifth letter might be something else.

Another common word: ""APHID"" -> A, P, H, I, D. This has A in 1, I in 4? A(1), P(2), H(3), I(4), D(5). So that's a word. And it has D in 5 and O is not present? But we know O is in the word! So we cannot use ""APHID"" because it doesn't have O.

Similarly, ""RAPID"" has R, excluded.

So, we must have O in the word.

Therefore, ""AVOID"" seems a good candidate.

We can also consider ""ABOIL"" but that doesn't have D.

So, I think ""AVOID"" is a reasonable guess.

But note: we are not sure if V is in the word. If we guess ""AVOID"", and if V is not in the word, we get feedback that V is absent, and then we know that the word must be of the form A ? O I D, and the second letter is not V and not any excluded letter.

Then we can try to find such a word.

If V is in the word and in position 2, then we might have solved it.

So, let's go with ""AVOID"".

Therefore, our third guess is ""AVOID"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C(not in word), R(not in word), A(in word, wrong position), N(not in word), E(not in word).  
  - This means:  
    - A is in the secret word but not in position 3.  
    - C, R, N, E are absent from the word.  

- **Guess 2: ""audio""** → A(correct position), U(not in word), D(in word, wrong position), I(correct position), O(in word, wrong position).  
  - This means:  
    - A is confirmed in position 1.  
    - I is confirmed in position 4.  
    - D is in the word but not in position 3.  
    - O is in the word but not in position 5.  
    - U is absent from the word.  

### Key Insights:
- **Secret word structure**: The word must start with `A` (position 1) and have `I` in position 4: `A _ _ I _`.  
- **Confirmed letters in the word**: A, I, D, O.  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, U (cannot appear in the word).  
- **Constraints for D and O**:  
  - D cannot be in position 3 (from ""audio"" feedback).  
  - O cannot be in position 5 (from ""audio"" feedback).  
- **Remaining positions**: Positions 2, 3, and 5 are unknown.  
  - D and O must occupy two of these positions (since they are in the word), and one additional letter (not yet guessed) must fill the remaining position.  
- **Possible placements for D and O**:  
  - D can be in position 2 or 5.  
  - O can be in position 2 or 3.  
  - They cannot share the same position.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test the most likely placement of D and O while introducing a new common letter to gather information.  
- The word ""avoid"" is chosen because:  
  - It fits the structure `A _ _ I _` (A in 1, I in 4).  
  - It places O in position 3 (testing if O is correctly there) and D in position 5 (testing if D is correctly there).  
  - It introduces a new common letter, V, in position 2 (to check if V is in the word).  
  - It avoids all excluded letters (C, R, N, E, U).  
- If ""avoid"" is correct, we solve the puzzle. If not, the feedback will:  
  - Confirm or rule out V.  
  - Clarify the positions of D and O (e.g., if O is not in position 3 or D is not in position 5).  

<guess>avoid</guess>",avoid,"We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- C, R, N, E are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.

Guess 2: ""audio"" -> A(✓), U(x), D(-), I(✓), O(-)
Meaning:
- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- U is not in the word.
- D is in the word but not in position 3.
- I is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- O is in the word but not in position 5.

So, from the feedback, we know:

1. The first letter is A (since A is correct in position 1).
2. The fourth letter is I (since I is correct in position 4).
3. The word contains D and O, but:
   - D is not in position 3 (since in ""audio"" it was in position 3 and got a minus).
   - O is not in position 5 (since in ""audio"" it was in position 5 and got a minus).
4. The letters C, R, N, E, U are not in the word.

Also, we know from the first guess that A is in the word (now confirmed at position 1) and that it is not in position 3 (which is consistent).

So the secret word has the form: A _ _ I _

We also know that D and O are in the word, but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively.

Since D is in the word but not in position 3, and O is in the word but not in position 5, they must be in one of the remaining positions: 2, 3, or 5 for D, and 2, 3, or 4 for O. But note position 4 is already taken by I, so O cannot be in position 4. Therefore, O must be in position 2 or 3.

Similarly, D cannot be in position 3 (from the feedback of ""audio""), so D must be in position 2 or 5.

But note: the word has only 5 letters, and we have:

Position 1: A
Position 2: unknown
Position 3: unknown
Position 4: I
Position 5: unknown

We know the word contains D and O, and one more letter (since we have 5 letters and we already have A, I, D, O, but D and O are two additional letters, so the fifth letter is unknown).

Actually, the word must contain at least A, I, D, O. But we don't know if there are duplicate letters. However, so far we have no indication of duplicates.

So, the secret word is A, ?, ?, I, ? and the letters to fill are two positions (2,3,5) with the letters D, O, and one more letter (since we have three positions and two known letters D and O, but we need three letters for positions 2,3,5). Therefore, there must be one more letter that we haven't guessed yet.

We have:
- Known present letters: A, I, D, O.
- We have three positions to fill: 2, 3, 5.

But we have two known letters (D and O) that must be placed in two of these three positions, and one more letter that we don't know.

So, we need to find a word of the form A _ _ I _ that includes D and O, and one more letter (which is not C, R, N, E, U, and also not A, I, D, O because we already have them? But note, A and I are already placed, so they are fixed. The remaining positions must be filled with D, O, and one new letter.

But wait: the word must contain D and O, but they might be in the remaining positions. However, we have three positions and two letters, so we need one more letter that is in the word.

Therefore, the secret word has exactly five distinct letters? Not necessarily, but we don't have evidence of duplicates. So we assume no duplicates for now.

So, we need to guess a word that:
- Starts with A, ends with I in the fourth position? Actually, the fourth position is I, so the word is A _ _ I _.

Specifically: 
Position 1: A
Position 2: ? (must be one of D, O, or a new letter)
Position 3: ? (must be one of D, O, or a new letter)
Position 4: I
Position 5: ? (must be one of D, O, or a new letter)

But we know that D and O are in the word, so they must occupy two of these three positions.

Also, we know:
- D cannot be in position 3 (from ""audio"" feedback: D was in position 3 and got minus, so it's present but not there).
- O cannot be in position 5 (from ""audio"" feedback: O was in position 5 and got minus, so it's present but not there).

So, for D: it can be in position 2 or 5.
For O: it can be in position 2 or 3.

But note: position 2 and 3 are available for both, but they cannot both be in the same position.

We have two possibilities for the placement of D and O:

Option 1: D in position 2, then O must be in position 3 (because if D is in 2, then O cannot be in 2, so O must be in 3, and then position 5 is a new letter).

Option 2: D in position 5, then O can be in position 2 or 3.

But if D is in position 5, then O can be in 2 or 3, and the remaining position (3 or 2) is a new letter.

Similarly, if D is in position 2 and O in position 3, then position 5 is a new letter.

We also have the constraint that the new letter must not be C, R, N, E, U.

Now, we need to make a third guess. We want to test these possibilities.

We should try to form a word that fits the pattern and tests the possible placements.

We know the word must have A in 1, I in 4, and include D and O.

Let's list possible words that fit A _ _ I _ and have D and O.

But we don't know the fifth letter, so we need to guess a word that can give us information.

We can try to use a word that has D and O in the positions we want to test, and a new letter that is common.

For example, if we try to put D in position 2 and O in position 3: then the word would be A D O I ?. But we need a valid word. What word is A D O I *? For example, ""ADIOS"" but S is a possible letter, and we haven't excluded S. However, ""ADIOS"" has O in position 3 and D in position 2? A-D-I-O-S -> that's positions: 1:A, 2:D, 3:I, 4:O, 5:S. But in our case, position 4 must be I, so that doesn't work because in ""ADIOS"", the fourth letter is O, not I.

We need the fourth letter to be I. So the word must be A _ _ I _.

So, if we put D in position 2 and O in position 3: then we have A D O I ?. What letter can be in position 5? We need a word that ends with I and then the fifth letter? Actually, the word is A, D, O, I, and then the fifth letter. So it would be ""ADOI?"".

Is ""ADOIX"" a word? We need a real word. Let's think: ""ADOPT"" but that has P and T, and the fourth letter is P, not I.

We need the fourth letter to be I. So the word must be A _ _ I _.

Common words: 
- ""AUDIO"" we already tried, but that had U and we know U is not in the word.
- ""AVOID"": A, V, O, I, D -> positions: 1:A, 2:V, 3:O, 4:I, 5:D.

This word ""AVOID"" has:
- A in 1: correct (we know A is in 1)
- V: unknown
- O in 3: we know O is in the word, but we don't know if it's in position 3? We are testing.
- I in 4: correct (we know I is in 4)
- D in 5: we know D is in the word, but we don't know if it's in position 5.

Also, we haven't used V before, so it might be in the word or not.

But note: in ""AVOID"", we have O in position 3 and D in position 5.

Now, from our earlier constraints:
- O cannot be in position 5 (from ""audio"" feedback: O was in 5 and got minus, so it's not in 5). Therefore, if we put D in position 5, that is allowed because D was not in position 5 in the previous guess? The constraint for D is that it cannot be in position 3, but position 5 is allowed.

Similarly, O cannot be in position 5, but in ""AVOID"" it is in position 3, which is allowed because we only know it's not in 5.

So, ""AVOID"" is a candidate for our guess.

But we don't know if V is in the word. If we guess ""AVOID"", we can get feedback on V, O in position 3, and D in position 5.

Alternatively, we could try a word that puts O in position 2 and D in position 5, for example.

But let's see: if we put O in position 2, then the word would be A O ? I ?. And we need to put D somewhere. D cannot be in position 3, so it must be in position 5. Then the word would be A O ? I D. So the third position is a new letter.

What word is A O ? I D? For example, ""AVOID"" is A V O I D -> that's A, V, O, I, D. So that's the same as above? No: in ""AVOID"", the second letter is V, third is O, fourth is I, fifth is D. So if we want O in position 2, we need a word like A O _ I _. For example, ""AORTA"" but that has R (excluded) and T, and the fourth letter is T, not I.

Another example: ""AORTA"" is not valid because of R and no I in fourth.

""ABOIL"": A, B, O, I, L -> that's A, B, O, I, L. So second letter B, third O, fourth I, fifth L. But we want O in second? That would be A, O, then the third letter, then I, then D? We don't have D in that word.

We need to include D. So if we want O in position 2 and D in position 5, we need a word: A O X I D, where X is a letter that makes a word.

Is there a word ""AOVID""? Not a word. ""AODID""? Not a word.

So, it's hard to form a word with O in position 2 and D in position 5.

Another possibility: O in position 2 and D in position 3? But D cannot be in position 3 (from feedback). So that's not allowed.

Therefore, the only possibilities for D and O are:
- D in position 2 and O in position 3 -> word: A D O I ? (and we need a fifth letter)
- D in position 5 and O in position 2 -> but we couldn't find a word for O in 2 and D in 5? Actually, we can have O in position 2 and D in position 5, but we need a letter for position 3. So the word would be A O X I D. What words are there? I can't think of any common word. ""AOXID"" is not a word. ""AODID"" not a word. ""AVID"" is four letters. So probably not.

Alternatively, D in position 5 and O in position 3: then the word is A ? O I D. So second letter is a new letter. For example, ""ALOID"" (which means resembling fat) but that's A, L, O, I, D. So second letter L, third O, fourth I, fifth D. That's a valid word? I think ""ALOID"" is a word, but it's rare.

More common: ""AVOID"" is a common word, which has O in 3 and D in 5.

So, the two main possibilities are:
1. D in 2, O in 3: then word is A D O I ? (fifth letter needed, say X)
2. O in 3, D in 5: then word is A ? O I D (second letter needed, say Y)

We can test one of these.

We can guess ""AVOID"" to test the second possibility: if ""AVOID"" is the word, we win. If not, we get feedback.

In ""AVOID"", we have:
- A: should be correct (position 1)
- V: unknown, we'll see
- O: in position 3, we know O is in the word, but we don't know if it's in 3
- I: correct (position 4)
- D: in position 5, we know D is in the word, but we don't know if it's in 5

If we guess ""AVOID"", the feedback will tell us:
- If V is in the word and in the correct position? But we don't know if V is in the word.
- Also, it will tell us if O is in position 3 and if D is in position 5.

But note: if the secret word is not ""AVOID"", we still get information.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests the other possibility (D in 2 and O in 3) but we need a fifth letter. What word has A, D, O, I, and one more letter? For example, ""ADMIN"" but N is excluded. ""ADOPT"" has P and T, but fourth letter is P, not I. ""ADORE"" has E and R, excluded. ""ADIOS"" has S, but fourth letter is O, not I.

I cannot find a common word with A, D, O, I and a fifth letter that is not excluded, and with the pattern A D O I ?.

So, perhaps the second possibility (O in 3 and D in 5) is more likely, and ""AVOID"" is a good guess.

But we must consider that there might be other letters. For example, the fifth letter might be something else.

Another common word: ""APHID"" -> A, P, H, I, D. This has A in 1, I in 4? A(1), P(2), H(3), I(4), D(5). So that's a word. And it has D in 5 and O is not present? But we know O is in the word! So we cannot use ""APHID"" because it doesn't have O.

Similarly, ""RAPID"" has R, excluded.

So, we must have O in the word.

Therefore, ""AVOID"" seems a good candidate.

We can also consider ""ABOIL"" but that doesn't have D.

So, I think ""AVOID"" is a reasonable guess.

But note: we are not sure if V is in the word. If we guess ""AVOID"", and if V is not in the word, we get feedback that V is absent, and then we know that the word must be of the form A ? O I D, and the second letter is not V and not any excluded letter.

Then we can try to find such a word.

If V is in the word and in position 2, then we might have solved it.

So, let's go with ""AVOID"".

Therefore, our third guess is ""AVOID"".Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C(not in word), R(not in word), A(in word, wrong position), N(not in word), E(not in word).  
  - This means:  
    - A is in the secret word but not in position 3.  
    - C, R, N, E are absent from the word.  

- **Guess 2: ""audio""** → A(correct position), U(not in word), D(in word, wrong position), I(correct position), O(in word, wrong position).  
  - This means:  
    - A is confirmed in position 1.  
    - I is confirmed in position 4.  
    - D is in the word but not in position 3.  
    - O is in the word but not in position 5.  
    - U is absent from the word.  

### Key Insights:
- **Secret word structure**: The word must start with `A` (position 1) and have `I` in position 4: `A _ _ I _`.  
- **Confirmed letters in the word**: A, I, D, O.  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, U (cannot appear in the word).  
- **Constraints for D and O**:  
  - D cannot be in position 3 (from ""audio"" feedback).  
  - O cannot be in position 5 (from ""audio"" feedback).  
- **Remaining positions**: Positions 2, 3, and 5 are unknown.  
  - D and O must occupy two of these positions (since they are in the word), and one additional letter (not yet guessed) must fill the remaining position.  
- **Possible placements for D and O**:  
  - D can be in position 2 or 5.  
  - O can be in position 2 or 3.  
  - They cannot share the same position.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test the most likely placement of D and O while introducing a new common letter to gather information.  
- The word ""avoid"" is chosen because:  
  - It fits the structure `A _ _ I _` (A in 1, I in 4).  
  - It places O in position 3 (testing if O is correctly there) and D in position 5 (testing if D is correctly there).  
  - It introduces a new common letter, V, in position 2 (to check if V is in the word).  
  - It avoids all excluded letters (C, R, N, E, U).  
- If ""avoid"" is correct, we solve the puzzle. If not, the feedback will:  
  - Confirm or rule out V.  
  - Clarify the positions of D and O (e.g., if O is not in position 3 or D is not in position 5).",Guess 3: avoid -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) V(✓) O(✓) I(✓) D(✓),SUCCESS
