 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common letters.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: ✓ (correct position, so the 4th letter is N)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The 4th letter is N.
- The letters C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.
- Since R and A are not in the word, we must avoid them.

We also know that the word has 5 letters and the 4th is N.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Has N as the 4th letter.
- Does not contain C, R, A, E.
- Includes other common letters to test.

Common consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we can avoid rare ones).

Common vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

We can try to use a word that has a mix of new consonants and a vowel.

Let's think of words that end with ""N"" (so the 4th letter is N, meaning the 5th letter is the last one). Actually, the 4th letter is the second last? Let me clarify:

In ""crane"", the positions are:
1: C
2: R
3: A
4: N
5: E

So the 4th letter is the fourth position. In the secret word, the 4th letter is N.

So the word is: _ _ _ N _

We know the word has N in the 4th position.

We must avoid C, R, A, E.

Let's try to think of words that fit: _ _ _ N _

We can use common letters: S, T, L, O, etc.

For example, words like:
- S T O N E -> but E is out, so not allowed.
- S T I N G -> this has S, T, I, N, G. None of the forbidden letters (C, R, A, E). So this is a candidate.

Another candidate: P L U N K -> but U is less common.

We could also try: B L I N D -> but D is common.

But note: we don't know if the word has S, T, etc. We are trying to test as many new letters as possible.

We have 6 tries, so we can be systematic.

Another idea: since we know the 4th letter is N, we can try to use a word that has different vowels and common consonants in the other positions.

Let's choose ""STING"" as a candidate.

But wait, in ""STING"", the positions are:
1: S
2: T
3: I
4: N
5: G

We know the 4th letter must be N, so that matches.

We are testing S, T, I, and G (since N is already confirmed).

Alternatively, we could choose ""BLUNT"", but note that we have to avoid R and A, and ""BLUNT"" has U and T, and B, L. But let's check the letters: B, L, U, N, T. None of C, R, A, E. So that's also a candidate.

But ""BLUNT"" has N in the 4th position? Let's see:
B L U N T -> positions: 1:B, 2:L, 3:U, 4:N, 5:T -> yes.

However, we might want to test more vowels. We haven't tested O, U, I yet.

But in the first guess, we tested A and E and they are out, so we have I, O, U left.

We can try to include one of these.

Another common word: ""POINT"" -> P, O, I, N, T. This has O and I, which are vowels we haven't tested. And no forbidden letters.

But note: we must avoid E, and ""POINT"" doesn't have E.

So ""POINT"" is a good candidate.

Similarly, ""JOINT"" or ""MOUNT"", but we don't know if J or M are in the word.

We can also consider ""SHINY"", but Y might be less common.

I think ""POINT"" is a solid choice because it tests three new common letters (P, O, I, T) and we already know N is in the 4th position.

So let's go with ""POINT"".

But note: we are not required to have the N in the same position? Actually, we know the 4th letter is N, so we must have N in the 4th position in our guess to confirm? Actually, we already know it's there, but we can use it to test other letters.

In the feedback for the next guess, we will get information about the other positions.

So, I'll choose ""POINT"".

But wait, what if the word has double letters? We don't know, but we can avoid that for now.

Another candidate: ""MINTS"" but that has S at the end and M at the beginning, and we don't know about S.

But ""POINT"" seems good.

Alternatively, ""STUNG"" -> S, T, U, N, G. This tests U and G.

But I think ""POINT"" is better because it tests two vowels (O and I) and common consonants.

So, I'll go with ""POINT"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and E are not in the secret word at all.
- The 4th letter is N (confirmed correct position).

The secret word format is: _ _ _ N _

For the next guess:
- Must avoid C, R, A, E.
- Should test new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, I, O, P) to gather more information.
- ""POINT"" is a strong choice because:
  - It has N in the 4th position (using known correct placement).
  - It tests new vowels (O, I) and consonants (P, T).
  - All letters are distinct and common, maximizing feedback potential.

Actually, the 4th letter is the second last? Let me clarify:\n\nIn ""crane"", the positions are:\n1: C\n2: R\n3: A\n4: N\n5: E\n\nSo the 4th letter is the fourth position. In the secret word, the 4th letter is N.\n\nSo the word is: _ _ _ N _\n\nWe know the word has N in the 4th position.\n\nWe must avoid C, R, A, E.\n\nLet\'s try to think of words that fit: _ _ _ N _\n\nWe can use common letters: S, T, L, O, etc.\n\nFor example, words like:\n- S T O N E -> but E is out, so not allowed.\n- S T I N G -> this has S, T, I, N, G.

So this is a candidate.\n\nAnother candidate: P L U N K -> but U is less common.\n\nWe could also try: B L I N D -> but D is common.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if the word has S, T, etc. We are trying to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nWe have 6 tries, so we can be systematic.\n\nAnother idea: since we know the 4th letter is N, we can try to use a word that has different vowels and common consonants in the other positions.\n\nLet\'s choose ""STING"" as a candidate.\n\nBut wait, in ""STING"", the positions are:\n1: S\n2: T\n3: I\n4: N\n5: G\n\nWe know the 4th letter must be N, so that matches.\n\nWe are testing S, T, I, and G (since N is already confirmed).\n\nAlternatively, we could choose ""BLUNT"", but note that we have to avoid R and A, and ""BLUNT"" has U and T, and B, L. But let\'s check the letters: B, L, U, N, T. None of C, R, A, E. So that\'s also a candidate.\n\nBut ""BLUNT"" has N in the 4th position? Let\'s see:\nB L U N T -> positions: 1:B, 2:L, 3:U, 4:N, 5:T -> yes.\n\nHowever, we might want to test more vowels. We haven\'t tested O, U, I yet.\n\nBut in the first guess, we tested A and E and they are out, so we have I, O, U left.\n\nWe can try to include one of these.\n\nAnother common word: ""POINT"" -> P, O, I, N, T. This has O and I, which are vowels we haven\'t tested. And no forbidden letters.\n\nBut note: we must avoid E, and ""POINT"" doesn\'t have E.\n\nSo ""POINT"" is a good candidate.\n\nSimilarly, ""JOINT"" or ""MOUNT"", but we don\'t know if J or M are in the word.\n\nWe can also consider ""SHINY"", but Y might be less common.\n\nI think ""POINT"" is a solid choice because it tests three new common letters (P, O, I, T) and we already know N is in the 4th position.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""POINT"".\n\nBut note: we are not required to have the N in the same position? Actually, we know the 4th letter is N, so we must have N in the 4th position in our guess to confirm? Actually, we already know it\'s there, but we can use it to test other letters.\n\nIn the feedback for the next guess, we will get information about the other positions.\n\nSo, I\'ll choose ""POINT"".\n\nBut wait, what if the word has double letters? We don\'t know, but we can avoid that for now.\n\nAnother candidate: ""MINTS"" but that has S at the end and M at the beginning, and we don\'t know about S.\n\nBut ""POINT"" seems good.\n\nAlternatively, ""STUNG"" -> S, T, U, N, G. This tests U and G.\n\nBut I think ""POINT"" is better because it tests two vowels (O and I) and common consonants.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""POINT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, A, and E are not in the secret word at all.\n- The 4th letter is N (confirmed correct position).\n\nThe secret word format is: _ _ _ N _\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must avoid C, R, A, E.\n- Should test new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, I, O, P) to gather more information.\n- ""POINT"" is a strong choice because:\n  - It has N in the 4th position (using known correct placement).\n  - It tests new vowels (O, I) and consonants (P, T).\n  - All letters are distinct and common, maximizing feedback potential.\n\n<guess>point</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(✓) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)
This means:
- N is in the word and in the correct position (4th).
- C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: ""point"" -> P(x), O(✓), I(x), N(✓), T(x)
This means:
- O is in the word and in the correct position (2nd? Let's check the positions).
  In ""point"", the positions are:
    1: P
    2: O
    3: I
    4: N
    5: T
- So, O is correct and in the 2nd position? But wait, the feedback says O(✓) meaning correct and in the correct position. So the second letter of the secret word is O.
- N is also correct and in the 4th position (which we already knew).
- P, I, T are not in the word at all.

But note: the feedback for ""point"" says:
  P(x) -> not in word
  O(✓) -> correct and in position 2
  I(x) -> not in word
  N(✓) -> correct and in position 4 (we knew that)
  T(x) -> not in word

Therefore, we now know:
- The secret word has the second letter O and the fourth letter N.
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, E, P, I, T (from the x's in both guesses).

Also, from the first guess, we know the first, third, and fifth letters are not C, R, A, E, and now we add P, I, T to the absent letters.

So, absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I, T.

We also know the word is of the form: _ O _ N _

We need to find a word that fits: 
- Position 2: O
- Position 4: N
- The letters in positions 1, 3, 5 must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the absent letters.

Remaining letters: We have 26 letters minus the absent ones: C, R, A, E, P, I, T.

List of available letters: 
B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: O is already used in position 2, but it might appear again? However, we don't know. We should consider that the word might have duplicate letters, but since we haven't encountered any duplicates in feedback, we can assume for now that letters are unique unless we get evidence otherwise.

In the feedback, we have two correct letters: O and N, and they are in different positions. We don't have any indication of duplicates, so we can try to avoid using O and N again in other positions to test new letters.

Now, we need to guess the first, third, and fifth letters.

We should choose a word that:
- Has the form: _ O _ N _
- Uses only the available letters (not in the absent list).
- Tests new common letters to maximize information.

Common letters left: S, L, U, D, M, G, B, etc.

We can try to form words like:
- ? O ? N ?

Possible words:
- S O L N ? -> but we need a 5-letter word. ""SOLON"" is a word? Let me check: SOLON is a proper noun? We should stick to common words. Also, note that the fifth letter must be from the available set.

Another: ""BOUND"" -> B O U N D. But we have the 4th letter as N, so in ""BOUND"": 
Position 1: B, 2: O, 3: U, 4: N, 5: D -> that fits the pattern.

But we must check if B, U, D are allowed. 
- B: not in absent list -> allowed
- U: not in absent list -> allowed
- D: not in absent list -> allowed

Also, we are testing three new letters: B, U, D.

Another possibility: ""MOUND"" -> M O U N D, same as above but with M.

Or ""SOUND"" -> S O U N D.

But note: we don't know if S is in the word. We haven't tested S yet.

Similarly, ""HOUND"", ""WOUND"", etc.

But we also have to consider that the third letter might be a vowel or consonant.

We could try ""LOINS"" but wait, I is in the absent list (from guess2: I(x)), so we cannot use I.

Another word: ""BOWLN"" is not a word.

We need real words.

Let me list some words that fit the pattern _ O _ N _ and use only available letters:

- B O _ N _ : possible words: BOUND, BOWNS (if BOWN is a word? Bown is not common, BOUND is good)
- D O _ N _ : DOWN? but that's 4 letters. We need 5. DOZEN? but Z is available, but E is absent (E is in the absent list). So DOZEN has E -> not allowed.
- F O _ N _ : FOUND? F O U N D -> but U and D are available. FOUND is a word.
- G O _ N _ : GOWN? 4 letters. GONAD? but A is absent. GONAD has A -> not allowed. GOURN? not a word.
- H O _ N _ : HOUND, HORNS? but R is absent. HOUND is good (H O U N D).
- J O _ N _ : JOU? JOU is not 5 letters. JOUGS? not common. JOULE? but E is absent. Probably not.
- K O _ N _ : KOW? not 5 letters. KORUN? not common. 
- L O _ N _ : LOINS? I is absent. LOUND? not common. LOUNS? not common. LOANS? A is absent. 
- M O _ N _ : MOUND, MOANS? A absent. MOONS? but O is already used, and we are not sure about duplicates. MOONS has two O's. We don't know if duplicates are allowed. But we can try to avoid for now to test more letters. MOUND is good (M O U N D).
- Q O _ N _ : not many words.
- S O _ N _ : SOUND, SOWNS? not common. SOWND? not common. SOURN? not common. SOUND is good.
- U O _ N _ : not common.
- V O _ N _ : VOW? not 5 letters. VOWEL? E absent. 
- W O _ N _ : WOUND, WOW? not 5 letters. WON? not 5. WOUND is good (W O U N D).
- Y O _ N _ : YOUNG? but U is used and G, but YOUNG is 5 letters: Y O U N G -> that fits: 1:Y, 2:O, 3:U, 4:N, 5:G. And Y, U, G are available.

So possible words: BOUND, FOUND, HOUND, MOUND, SOUND, WOUND, YOUNG.

We need to choose one that tests new letters. We are going to test three new letters at once.

But note: we have limited guesses left (4 more after this, since we used 2). We want to maximize information.

We can choose a word that uses common letters and avoids letters that might be less common.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has letters that appear in many words to get more coverage.

But note: we are testing the first, third, and fifth positions.

We can also consider that the third letter might be a vowel (like U) or a consonant.

In the list above, many words have U in the third position: BOUND, FOUND, HOUND, MOUND, SOUND, WOUND. YOUNG also has U in the third position.

So if we choose one of these, we are testing U in the third position and whatever in the first and fifth.

But if we choose ""YOUNG"", we test Y and G as well.

However, Y and G are less common than S, for example.

We could choose ""SOUND"" to test S and U and D.

But we have multiple words with U. If we choose one and it's wrong, we might still not know which one.

But we are not necessarily trying to solve in this guess; we are trying to get information.

We can choose a word that doesn't have U, to test a different vowel? But what other vowels are available? We have O (already used in position 2) and we have U, and we have Y (which can be a vowel). The other vowels A, E, I are out.

So U is the only vowel left? Not exactly, Y can be a vowel too.

But in the third position, we can have a consonant too.

For example, is there a word like ""BOLNS""? No.

What about ""SOLON""? SOLON is a word (a statesman in ancient Greece) but it's not very common. Also, it has O twice? S O L O N -> but that would be two O's. We don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, the second O would be in position 4? No: positions: 1:S, 2:O, 3:L, 4:O, 5:N -> but we know the 4th letter is N, so that doesn't match. So not.

Another word: ""BONUS"" -> but that's B O N U S, which would be 1:B, 2:O, 3:N, 4:U, 5:S -> but we know the 4th letter is N, not U. So that doesn't fit.

We must have the 4th letter as N.

So the pattern is fixed: _ O _ N _

And the third letter cannot be N because then it would be _ O N N _, but we don't know if duplicates are allowed. But we can avoid for now.

Given the available words, let's pick one that uses common letters.

Common consonants: S, L, D, M, etc.

We can choose ""SOUND"": S O U N D -> tests S, U, D.

If we get feedback, we might know if S, U, or D are in the word and in which positions.

Similarly, ""HOUND"" tests H, U, D.

But S is more common than H.

We can also consider ""YOUNG"": Y O U N G -> tests Y, U, G.

But Y and G are less common.

Another word: ""DOUGH"" -> D O U G H -> but the 4th letter must be N, so that doesn't work.

We must have N in the 4th.

So I think ""SOUND"" is a good choice because S is a very common letter.

We can also consider ""MOUND"" to test M.

But S is more common.

Let's go with ""SOUND"".

But note: we are using U again? We are testing U in the third position. If U is not in the word, then we know that the third letter is not U, and we can eliminate all the U words.

If U is in the word, then we know it's in the third position? Not necessarily, because the feedback might show it in a different position? But in this guess, we are putting U in the third position. If the secret word has U but not in the third, then we would get a '-' for U (present but wrong position). But we are guessing the word as S O U N D, so if U is in the word but not in third, we get U(-). If not, we get U(x).

Similarly for S and D.

So we can get information about S, U, D.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn't use U to test a different letter. But what other words are there without U?

Let me think: are there words that fit _ O _ N _ without U?

For example:
- ""BOWNS"" is not common.
- ""COWNS"" but C is absent.
- ""DOWNS"" -> D O W N S -> that's a word. But W and S are available. So ""DOWNS"": 1:D, 2:O, 3:W, 4:N, 5:S.

That's a valid word. And it tests D, W, S.

Similarly, ""TOWNS"" but T is absent.

""GOWNS"" -> G O W N S -> G, W, S.

""NOW?S"" not.

""JOWLS"" -> J O W L S -> but that's 1:J, 2:O, 3:W, 4:L, 5:S -> but we need 4th to be N, so no.

""KOW?S"" not.

""LOW?S"" not.

""MOW?S"" not.

""NOW?S"" not.

""ROW?S"" R absent.

""SOW?S"" not.

""WOW?S"" not.

""YOW?S"" not.

So ""DOWNS"" and ""GOWNS"" are options without U.

We can also consider ""BONDS"" but O is in position 2? B O N D S -> 1:B, 2:O, 3:N, 4:D, 5:S -> but we need 4th to be N, so that's not.

Another: ""CON?S"" C absent.

""FON?S"" not common.

""GON?S"" not.

""HON?S"" not.

""MON?S"" not.

""SON?S"" not.

""TON?S"" T absent.

So the only words without U that I can think of are ""DOWNS"" and ""GOWNS"", and they have W which is less common.

We also have ""YOWNS"" which is a word (to yowl), but rare.

So, to test more common letters, it might be better to go with a word that has U, like ""SOUND"" or ""HOUND"".

I think ""SOUND"" is a good choice.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If we guess ""SOUND"", and the secret word is, say, ""BOUND"", then we would get:
- S: not in word -> x
- O: correct and in position -> ✓
- U: in word but not in position? In ""BOUND"", U is in position 3, so if we put U in position 3, it would be correct? But in ""BOUND"", the third letter is U, so if the secret word is ""BOUND"", then in ""SOUND"", U is in the same position, so it would be ✓? No, because the secret word is ""BOUND"", and we are guessing ""SOUND"", so:
  Position 1: S vs B -> not match, and S is not in ""BOUND"" -> x
  Position 2: O vs O -> match, ✓
  Position 3: U vs U -> match, ✓
  Position 4: N vs N -> match, ✓
  Position 5: D vs D -> match, ✓
But that would solve it. But we don't know if it's ""BOUND"" or not.

But if it's not, we get information.

Similarly, if the secret word is ""YOUNG"", then ""SOUND"" would have:
  S: not in ""YOUNG"" -> x
  O: ✓
  U: in ""YOUNG"" and in position 3? ""YOUNG"" has U in position 3, so ✓
  N: ✓
  D: not in ""YOUNG"" -> x
So we get: S(x), O(✓), U(✓), N(✓), D(x)

Then we know the word is _ O U N _ and the first and fifth are not S or D, and we have to find which letters.

But we have more guesses.

Alternatively, if we choose ""YOUNG"", we test Y and G.

But I think ""SOUND"" is a solid choice.

We can also consider that we have only 4 guesses left, so we might want to cover more ground.

Another idea: we can choose a word that doesn't use U to see if U is in the word. For example, if we choose ""DOWNS"", then:
- If U is in the word, we would get a '-' for U? But we are not using U, so we wouldn't know. We would only know about the letters we guess.

If we choose a word without U, and U is in the word, we might not get any information about U. But we can infer from the absence of U in the feedback? No, because we didn't test U.

So to test U, we need to include it in a guess.

Therefore, it might be better to include U to check if it's present.

Similarly for other letters.

So I think ""SOUND"" is a good guess.

Let's go with that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)  
  This means:  
  - N is in the word and correctly placed in the 4th position.  
  - C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.  

- **Guess 2: ""point""** → P(x), O(✓), I(x), N(✓), T(x)  
  This means:  
  - O is in the word and correctly placed in the 2nd position.  
  - N is confirmed again in the 4th position (already known).  
  - P, I, T are not in the word at all.  

### Current Knowledge:
- **Confirmed positions**:  
  - 2nd letter: O  
  - 4th letter: N  
  So the secret word pattern is: `_ O _ N _`  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, E, P, I, T (these cannot appear anywhere).  
- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, S, U, V, W, Y, Z (and O, N are confirmed but may not repeat).  
- **Goal for next guess**: Test new common letters (e.g., S, U, D, L, M) to gather more information, especially for positions 1, 3, and 5.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- The word must fit `_ O _ N _` and avoid absent letters.  
- Prioritize testing high-frequency letters like S, U, D, and L to maximize feedback.  
- A good candidate is **""SOUND""**:  
  - It fits the pattern: S (position 1), O (position 2), U (position 3), N (position 4), D (position 5).  
  - It tests three new common letters: S, U, D.  
  - If S, U, or D are in the word, feedback will reveal their presence/position, narrowing down possibilities significantly.  
- Alternatives like ""HOUND"" or ""MOUND"" were considered, but ""SOUND"" is chosen because S is a very common starting letter, and U is the only untested vowel available.  

<guess>sound</guess>",sound,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)
This means:
- N is in the word and in the correct position (4th).
- C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: ""point"" -> P(x), O(✓), I(x), N(✓), T(x)
This means:
- O is in the word and in the correct position (2nd? Let's check the positions).
  In ""point"", the positions are:
    1: P
    2: O
    3: I
    4: N
    5: T
- So, O is correct and in the 2nd position? But wait, the feedback says O(✓) meaning correct and in the correct position. So the second letter of the secret word is O.
- N is also correct and in the 4th position (which we already knew).
- P, I, T are not in the word at all.

But note: the feedback for ""point"" says:
  P(x) -> not in word
  O(✓) -> correct and in position 2
  I(x) -> not in word
  N(✓) -> correct and in position 4 (we knew that)
  T(x) -> not in word

Therefore, we now know:
- The secret word has the second letter O and the fourth letter N.
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, E, P, I, T (from the x's in both guesses).

Also, from the first guess, we know the first, third, and fifth letters are not C, R, A, E, and now we add P, I, T to the absent letters.

So, absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I, T.

We also know the word is of the form: _ O _ N _

We need to find a word that fits: 
- Position 2: O
- Position 4: N
- The letters in positions 1, 3, 5 must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the absent letters.

Remaining letters: We have 26 letters minus the absent ones: C, R, A, E, P, I, T.

List of available letters: 
B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: O is already used in position 2, but it might appear again? However, we don't know. We should consider that the word might have duplicate letters, but since we haven't encountered any duplicates in feedback, we can assume for now that letters are unique unless we get evidence otherwise.

In the feedback, we have two correct letters: O and N, and they are in different positions. We don't have any indication of duplicates, so we can try to avoid using O and N again in other positions to test new letters.

Now, we need to guess the first, third, and fifth letters.

We should choose a word that:
- Has the form: _ O _ N _
- Uses only the available letters (not in the absent list).
- Tests new common letters to maximize information.

Common letters left: S, L, U, D, M, G, B, etc.

We can try to form words like:
- ? O ? N ?

Possible words:
- S O L N ? -> but we need a 5-letter word. ""SOLON"" is a word? Let me check: SOLON is a proper noun? We should stick to common words. Also, note that the fifth letter must be from the available set.

Another: ""BOUND"" -> B O U N D. But we have the 4th letter as N, so in ""BOUND"": 
Position 1: B, 2: O, 3: U, 4: N, 5: D -> that fits the pattern.

But we must check if B, U, D are allowed. 
- B: not in absent list -> allowed
- U: not in absent list -> allowed
- D: not in absent list -> allowed

Also, we are testing three new letters: B, U, D.

Another possibility: ""MOUND"" -> M O U N D, same as above but with M.

Or ""SOUND"" -> S O U N D.

But note: we don't know if S is in the word. We haven't tested S yet.

Similarly, ""HOUND"", ""WOUND"", etc.

But we also have to consider that the third letter might be a vowel or consonant.

We could try ""LOINS"" but wait, I is in the absent list (from guess2: I(x)), so we cannot use I.

Another word: ""BOWLN"" is not a word.

We need real words.

Let me list some words that fit the pattern _ O _ N _ and use only available letters:

- B O _ N _ : possible words: BOUND, BOWNS (if BOWN is a word? Bown is not common, BOUND is good)
- D O _ N _ : DOWN? but that's 4 letters. We need 5. DOZEN? but Z is available, but E is absent (E is in the absent list). So DOZEN has E -> not allowed.
- F O _ N _ : FOUND? F O U N D -> but U and D are available. FOUND is a word.
- G O _ N _ : GOWN? 4 letters. GONAD? but A is absent. GONAD has A -> not allowed. GOURN? not a word.
- H O _ N _ : HOUND, HORNS? but R is absent. HOUND is good (H O U N D).
- J O _ N _ : JOU? JOU is not 5 letters. JOUGS? not common. JOULE? but E is absent. Probably not.
- K O _ N _ : KOW? not 5 letters. KORUN? not common. 
- L O _ N _ : LOINS? I is absent. LOUND? not common. LOUNS? not common. LOANS? A is absent. 
- M O _ N _ : MOUND, MOANS? A absent. MOONS? but O is already used, and we are not sure about duplicates. MOONS has two O's. We don't know if duplicates are allowed. But we can try to avoid for now to test more letters. MOUND is good (M O U N D).
- Q O _ N _ : not many words.
- S O _ N _ : SOUND, SOWNS? not common. SOWND? not common. SOURN? not common. SOUND is good.
- U O _ N _ : not common.
- V O _ N _ : VOW? not 5 letters. VOWEL? E absent. 
- W O _ N _ : WOUND, WOW? not 5 letters. WON? not 5. WOUND is good (W O U N D).
- Y O _ N _ : YOUNG? but U is used and G, but YOUNG is 5 letters: Y O U N G -> that fits: 1:Y, 2:O, 3:U, 4:N, 5:G. And Y, U, G are available.

So possible words: BOUND, FOUND, HOUND, MOUND, SOUND, WOUND, YOUNG.

We need to choose one that tests new letters. We are going to test three new letters at once.

But note: we have limited guesses left (4 more after this, since we used 2). We want to maximize information.

We can choose a word that uses common letters and avoids letters that might be less common.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has letters that appear in many words to get more coverage.

But note: we are testing the first, third, and fifth positions.

We can also consider that the third letter might be a vowel (like U) or a consonant.

In the list above, many words have U in the third position: BOUND, FOUND, HOUND, MOUND, SOUND, WOUND. YOUNG also has U in the third position.

So if we choose one of these, we are testing U in the third position and whatever in the first and fifth.

But if we choose ""YOUNG"", we test Y and G as well.

However, Y and G are less common than S, for example.

We could choose ""SOUND"" to test S and U and D.

But we have multiple words with U. If we choose one and it's wrong, we might still not know which one.

But we are not necessarily trying to solve in this guess; we are trying to get information.

We can choose a word that doesn't have U, to test a different vowel? But what other vowels are available? We have O (already used in position 2) and we have U, and we have Y (which can be a vowel). The other vowels A, E, I are out.

So U is the only vowel left? Not exactly, Y can be a vowel too.

But in the third position, we can have a consonant too.

For example, is there a word like ""BOLNS""? No.

What about ""SOLON""? SOLON is a word (a statesman in ancient Greece) but it's not very common. Also, it has O twice? S O L O N -> but that would be two O's. We don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, the second O would be in position 4? No: positions: 1:S, 2:O, 3:L, 4:O, 5:N -> but we know the 4th letter is N, so that doesn't match. So not.

Another word: ""BONUS"" -> but that's B O N U S, which would be 1:B, 2:O, 3:N, 4:U, 5:S -> but we know the 4th letter is N, not U. So that doesn't fit.

We must have the 4th letter as N.

So the pattern is fixed: _ O _ N _

And the third letter cannot be N because then it would be _ O N N _, but we don't know if duplicates are allowed. But we can avoid for now.

Given the available words, let's pick one that uses common letters.

Common consonants: S, L, D, M, etc.

We can choose ""SOUND"": S O U N D -> tests S, U, D.

If we get feedback, we might know if S, U, or D are in the word and in which positions.

Similarly, ""HOUND"" tests H, U, D.

But S is more common than H.

We can also consider ""YOUNG"": Y O U N G -> tests Y, U, G.

But Y and G are less common.

Another word: ""DOUGH"" -> D O U G H -> but the 4th letter must be N, so that doesn't work.

We must have N in the 4th.

So I think ""SOUND"" is a good choice because S is a very common letter.

We can also consider ""MOUND"" to test M.

But S is more common.

Let's go with ""SOUND"".

But note: we are using U again? We are testing U in the third position. If U is not in the word, then we know that the third letter is not U, and we can eliminate all the U words.

If U is in the word, then we know it's in the third position? Not necessarily, because the feedback might show it in a different position? But in this guess, we are putting U in the third position. If the secret word has U but not in the third, then we would get a '-' for U (present but wrong position). But we are guessing the word as S O U N D, so if U is in the word but not in third, we get U(-). If not, we get U(x).

Similarly for S and D.

So we can get information about S, U, D.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn't use U to test a different letter. But what other words are there without U?

Let me think: are there words that fit _ O _ N _ without U?

For example:
- ""BOWNS"" is not common.
- ""COWNS"" but C is absent.
- ""DOWNS"" -> D O W N S -> that's a word. But W and S are available. So ""DOWNS"": 1:D, 2:O, 3:W, 4:N, 5:S.

That's a valid word. And it tests D, W, S.

Similarly, ""TOWNS"" but T is absent.

""GOWNS"" -> G O W N S -> G, W, S.

""NOW?S"" not.

""JOWLS"" -> J O W L S -> but that's 1:J, 2:O, 3:W, 4:L, 5:S -> but we need 4th to be N, so no.

""KOW?S"" not.

""LOW?S"" not.

""MOW?S"" not.

""NOW?S"" not.

""ROW?S"" R absent.

""SOW?S"" not.

""WOW?S"" not.

""YOW?S"" not.

So ""DOWNS"" and ""GOWNS"" are options without U.

We can also consider ""BONDS"" but O is in position 2? B O N D S -> 1:B, 2:O, 3:N, 4:D, 5:S -> but we need 4th to be N, so that's not.

Another: ""CON?S"" C absent.

""FON?S"" not common.

""GON?S"" not.

""HON?S"" not.

""MON?S"" not.

""SON?S"" not.

""TON?S"" T absent.

So the only words without U that I can think of are ""DOWNS"" and ""GOWNS"", and they have W which is less common.

We also have ""YOWNS"" which is a word (to yowl), but rare.

So, to test more common letters, it might be better to go with a word that has U, like ""SOUND"" or ""HOUND"".

I think ""SOUND"" is a good choice.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If we guess ""SOUND"", and the secret word is, say, ""BOUND"", then we would get:
- S: not in word -> x
- O: correct and in position -> ✓
- U: in word but not in position? In ""BOUND"", U is in position 3, so if we put U in position 3, it would be correct? But in ""BOUND"", the third letter is U, so if the secret word is ""BOUND"", then in ""SOUND"", U is in the same position, so it would be ✓? No, because the secret word is ""BOUND"", and we are guessing ""SOUND"", so:
  Position 1: S vs B -> not match, and S is not in ""BOUND"" -> x
  Position 2: O vs O -> match, ✓
  Position 3: U vs U -> match, ✓
  Position 4: N vs N -> match, ✓
  Position 5: D vs D -> match, ✓
But that would solve it. But we don't know if it's ""BOUND"" or not.

But if it's not, we get information.

Similarly, if the secret word is ""YOUNG"", then ""SOUND"" would have:
  S: not in ""YOUNG"" -> x
  O: ✓
  U: in ""YOUNG"" and in position 3? ""YOUNG"" has U in position 3, so ✓
  N: ✓
  D: not in ""YOUNG"" -> x
So we get: S(x), O(✓), U(✓), N(✓), D(x)

Then we know the word is _ O U N _ and the first and fifth are not S or D, and we have to find which letters.

But we have more guesses.

Alternatively, if we choose ""YOUNG"", we test Y and G.

But I think ""SOUND"" is a solid choice.

We can also consider that we have only 4 guesses left, so we might want to cover more ground.

Another idea: we can choose a word that doesn't use U to see if U is in the word. For example, if we choose ""DOWNS"", then:
- If U is in the word, we would get a '-' for U? But we are not using U, so we wouldn't know. We would only know about the letters we guess.

If we choose a word without U, and U is in the word, we might not get any information about U. But we can infer from the absence of U in the feedback? No, because we didn't test U.

So to test U, we need to include it in a guess.

Therefore, it might be better to include U to check if it's present.

Similarly for other letters.

So I think ""SOUND"" is a good guess.

Let's go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)  
  This means:  
  - N is in the word and correctly placed in the 4th position.  
  - C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.  

- **Guess 2: ""point""** → P(x), O(✓), I(x), N(✓), T(x)  
  This means:  
  - O is in the word and correctly placed in the 2nd position.  
  - N is confirmed again in the 4th position (already known).  
  - P, I, T are not in the word at all.  

### Current Knowledge:
- **Confirmed positions**:  
  - 2nd letter: O  
  - 4th letter: N  
  So the secret word pattern is: `_ O _ N _`  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, E, P, I, T (these cannot appear anywhere).  
- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, S, U, V, W, Y, Z (and O, N are confirmed but may not repeat).  
- **Goal for next guess**: Test new common letters (e.g., S, U, D, L, M) to gather more information, especially for positions 1, 3, and 5.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- The word must fit `_ O _ N _` and avoid absent letters.  
- Prioritize testing high-frequency letters like S, U, D, and L to maximize feedback.  
- A good candidate is **""SOUND""**:  
  - It fits the pattern: S (position 1), O (position 2), U (position 3), N (position 4), D (position 5).  
  - It tests three new common letters: S, U, D.  
  - If S, U, or D are in the word, feedback will reveal their presence/position, narrowing down possibilities significantly.  
- Alternatives like ""HOUND"" or ""MOUND"" were considered, but ""SOUND"" is chosen because S is a very common starting letter, and U is the only untested vowel available.",Guess 3: sound -> FEEDBACK: S(x) O(✓) U(x) N(✓) D(-),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: ✓ (correct position, so the 4th letter is N)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The 4th letter is N.
- The letters C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.
- Since R and A are not in the word, we must avoid them.

We also know that the word has 5 letters and the 4th is N.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Has N as the 4th letter.
- Does not contain C, R, A, E.
- Includes other common letters to test.

Common consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we can avoid rare ones).

Common vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

We can try to use a word that has a mix of new consonants and a vowel.

Let's think of words that end with ""N"" (so the 4th letter is N, meaning the 5th letter is the last one). Actually, the 4th letter is the second last? Let me clarify:

In ""crane"", the positions are:
1: C
2: R
3: A
4: N
5: E

So the 4th letter is the fourth position. In the secret word, the 4th letter is N.

So the word is: _ _ _ N _

We know the word has N in the 4th position.

We must avoid C, R, A, E.

Let's try to think of words that fit: _ _ _ N _

We can use common letters: S, T, L, O, etc.

For example, words like:
- S T O N E -> but E is out, so not allowed.
- S T I N G -> this has S, T, I, N, G. None of the forbidden letters (C, R, A, E). So this is a candidate.

Another candidate: P L U N K -> but U is less common.

We could also try: B L I N D -> but D is common.

But note: we don't know if the word has S, T, etc. We are trying to test as many new letters as possible.

We have 6 tries, so we can be systematic.

Another idea: since we know the 4th letter is N, we can try to use a word that has different vowels and common consonants in the other positions.

Let's choose ""STING"" as a candidate.

But wait, in ""STING"", the positions are:
1: S
2: T
3: I
4: N
5: G

We know the 4th letter must be N, so that matches.

We are testing S, T, I, and G (since N is already confirmed).

Alternatively, we could choose ""BLUNT"", but note that we have to avoid R and A, and ""BLUNT"" has U and T, and B, L. But let's check the letters: B, L, U, N, T. None of C, R, A, E. So that's also a candidate.

But ""BLUNT"" has N in the 4th position? Let's see:
B L U N T -> positions: 1:B, 2:L, 3:U, 4:N, 5:T -> yes.

However, we might want to test more vowels. We haven't tested O, U, I yet.

But in the first guess, we tested A and E and they are out, so we have I, O, U left.

We can try to include one of these.

Another common word: ""POINT"" -> P, O, I, N, T. This has O and I, which are vowels we haven't tested. And no forbidden letters.

But note: we must avoid E, and ""POINT"" doesn't have E.

So ""POINT"" is a good candidate.

Similarly, ""JOINT"" or ""MOUNT"", but we don't know if J or M are in the word.

We can also consider ""SHINY"", but Y might be less common.

I think ""POINT"" is a solid choice because it tests three new common letters (P, O, I, T) and we already know N is in the 4th position.

So let's go with ""POINT"".

But note: we are not required to have the N in the same position? Actually, we know the 4th letter is N, so we must have N in the 4th position in our guess to confirm? Actually, we already know it's there, but we can use it to test other letters.

In the feedback for the next guess, we will get information about the other positions.

So, I'll choose ""POINT"".

But wait, what if the word has double letters? We don't know, but we can avoid that for now.

Another candidate: ""MINTS"" but that has S at the end and M at the beginning, and we don't know about S.

But ""POINT"" seems good.

Alternatively, ""STUNG"" -> S, T, U, N, G. This tests U and G.

But I think ""POINT"" is better because it tests two vowels (O and I) and common consonants.

So, I'll go with ""POINT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and E are not in the secret word at all.
- The 4th letter is N (confirmed correct position).

The secret word format is: _ _ _ N _

For the next guess:
- Must avoid C, R, A, E.
- Should test new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, I, O, P) to gather more information.
- ""POINT"" is a strong choice because:
  - It has N in the 4th position (using known correct placement).
  - It tests new vowels (O, I) and consonants (P, T).
  - All letters are distinct and common, maximizing feedback potential.

<guess>point</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(✓) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)
This means:
- N is in the word and in the correct position (4th).
- C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: ""point"" -> P(x), O(✓), I(x), N(✓), T(x)
This means:
- O is in the word and in the correct position (2nd? Let's check the positions).
  In ""point"", the positions are:
    1: P
    2: O
    3: I
    4: N
    5: T
- So, O is correct and in the 2nd position? But wait, the feedback says O(✓) meaning correct and in the correct position. So the second letter of the secret word is O.
- N is also correct and in the 4th position (which we already knew).
- P, I, T are not in the word at all.

But note: the feedback for ""point"" says:
  P(x) -> not in word
  O(✓) -> correct and in position 2
  I(x) -> not in word
  N(✓) -> correct and in position 4 (we knew that)
  T(x) -> not in word

Therefore, we now know:
- The secret word has the second letter O and the fourth letter N.
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, E, P, I, T (from the x's in both guesses).

Also, from the first guess, we know the first, third, and fifth letters are not C, R, A, E, and now we add P, I, T to the absent letters.

So, absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I, T.

We also know the word is of the form: _ O _ N _

We need to find a word that fits: 
- Position 2: O
- Position 4: N
- The letters in positions 1, 3, 5 must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the absent letters.

Remaining letters: We have 26 letters minus the absent ones: C, R, A, E, P, I, T.

List of available letters: 
B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: O is already used in position 2, but it might appear again? However, we don't know. We should consider that the word might have duplicate letters, but since we haven't encountered any duplicates in feedback, we can assume for now that letters are unique unless we get evidence otherwise.

In the feedback, we have two correct letters: O and N, and they are in different positions. We don't have any indication of duplicates, so we can try to avoid using O and N again in other positions to test new letters.

Now, we need to guess the first, third, and fifth letters.

We should choose a word that:
- Has the form: _ O _ N _
- Uses only the available letters (not in the absent list).
- Tests new common letters to maximize information.

Common letters left: S, L, U, D, M, G, B, etc.

We can try to form words like:
- ? O ? N ?

Possible words:
- S O L N ? -> but we need a 5-letter word. ""SOLON"" is a word? Let me check: SOLON is a proper noun? We should stick to common words. Also, note that the fifth letter must be from the available set.

Another: ""BOUND"" -> B O U N D. But we have the 4th letter as N, so in ""BOUND"": 
Position 1: B, 2: O, 3: U, 4: N, 5: D -> that fits the pattern.

But we must check if B, U, D are allowed. 
- B: not in absent list -> allowed
- U: not in absent list -> allowed
- D: not in absent list -> allowed

Also, we are testing three new letters: B, U, D.

Another possibility: ""MOUND"" -> M O U N D, same as above but with M.

Or ""SOUND"" -> S O U N D.

But note: we don't know if S is in the word. We haven't tested S yet.

Similarly, ""HOUND"", ""WOUND"", etc.

But we also have to consider that the third letter might be a vowel or consonant.

We could try ""LOINS"" but wait, I is in the absent list (from guess2: I(x)), so we cannot use I.

Another word: ""BOWLN"" is not a word.

We need real words.

Let me list some words that fit the pattern _ O _ N _ and use only available letters:

- B O _ N _ : possible words: BOUND, BOWNS (if BOWN is a word? Bown is not common, BOUND is good)
- D O _ N _ : DOWN? but that's 4 letters. We need 5. DOZEN? but Z is available, but E is absent (E is in the absent list). So DOZEN has E -> not allowed.
- F O _ N _ : FOUND? F O U N D -> but U and D are available. FOUND is a word.
- G O _ N _ : GOWN? 4 letters. GONAD? but A is absent. GONAD has A -> not allowed. GOURN? not a word.
- H O _ N _ : HOUND, HORNS? but R is absent. HOUND is good (H O U N D).
- J O _ N _ : JOU? JOU is not 5 letters. JOUGS? not common. JOULE? but E is absent. Probably not.
- K O _ N _ : KOW? not 5 letters. KORUN? not common. 
- L O _ N _ : LOINS? I is absent. LOUND? not common. LOUNS? not common. LOANS? A is absent. 
- M O _ N _ : MOUND, MOANS? A absent. MOONS? but O is already used, and we are not sure about duplicates. MOONS has two O's. We don't know if duplicates are allowed. But we can try to avoid for now to test more letters. MOUND is good (M O U N D).
- Q O _ N _ : not many words.
- S O _ N _ : SOUND, SOWNS? not common. SOWND? not common. SOURN? not common. SOUND is good.
- U O _ N _ : not common.
- V O _ N _ : VOW? not 5 letters. VOWEL? E absent. 
- W O _ N _ : WOUND, WOW? not 5 letters. WON? not 5. WOUND is good (W O U N D).
- Y O _ N _ : YOUNG? but U is used and G, but YOUNG is 5 letters: Y O U N G -> that fits: 1:Y, 2:O, 3:U, 4:N, 5:G. And Y, U, G are available.

So possible words: BOUND, FOUND, HOUND, MOUND, SOUND, WOUND, YOUNG.

We need to choose one that tests new letters. We are going to test three new letters at once.

But note: we have limited guesses left (4 more after this, since we used 2). We want to maximize information.

We can choose a word that uses common letters and avoids letters that might be less common.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has letters that appear in many words to get more coverage.

But note: we are testing the first, third, and fifth positions.

We can also consider that the third letter might be a vowel (like U) or a consonant.

In the list above, many words have U in the third position: BOUND, FOUND, HOUND, MOUND, SOUND, WOUND. YOUNG also has U in the third position.

So if we choose one of these, we are testing U in the third position and whatever in the first and fifth.

But if we choose ""YOUNG"", we test Y and G as well.

However, Y and G are less common than S, for example.

We could choose ""SOUND"" to test S and U and D.

But we have multiple words with U. If we choose one and it's wrong, we might still not know which one.

But we are not necessarily trying to solve in this guess; we are trying to get information.

We can choose a word that doesn't have U, to test a different vowel? But what other vowels are available? We have O (already used in position 2) and we have U, and we have Y (which can be a vowel). The other vowels A, E, I are out.

So U is the only vowel left? Not exactly, Y can be a vowel too.

But in the third position, we can have a consonant too.

For example, is there a word like ""BOLNS""? No.

What about ""SOLON""? SOLON is a word (a statesman in ancient Greece) but it's not very common. Also, it has O twice? S O L O N -> but that would be two O's. We don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, the second O would be in position 4? No: positions: 1:S, 2:O, 3:L, 4:O, 5:N -> but we know the 4th letter is N, so that doesn't match. So not.

Another word: ""BONUS"" -> but that's B O N U S, which would be 1:B, 2:O, 3:N, 4:U, 5:S -> but we know the 4th letter is N, not U. So that doesn't fit.

We must have the 4th letter as N.

So the pattern is fixed: _ O _ N _

And the third letter cannot be N because then it would be _ O N N _, but we don't know if duplicates are allowed. But we can avoid for now.

Given the available words, let's pick one that uses common letters.

Common consonants: S, L, D, M, etc.

We can choose ""SOUND"": S O U N D -> tests S, U, D.

If we get feedback, we might know if S, U, or D are in the word and in which positions.

Similarly, ""HOUND"" tests H, U, D.

But S is more common than H.

We can also consider ""YOUNG"": Y O U N G -> tests Y, U, G.

But Y and G are less common.

Another word: ""DOUGH"" -> D O U G H -> but the 4th letter must be N, so that doesn't work.

We must have N in the 4th.

So I think ""SOUND"" is a good choice because S is a very common letter.

We can also consider ""MOUND"" to test M.

But S is more common.

Let's go with ""SOUND"".

But note: we are using U again? We are testing U in the third position. If U is not in the word, then we know that the third letter is not U, and we can eliminate all the U words.

If U is in the word, then we know it's in the third position? Not necessarily, because the feedback might show it in a different position? But in this guess, we are putting U in the third position. If the secret word has U but not in the third, then we would get a '-' for U (present but wrong position). But we are guessing the word as S O U N D, so if U is in the word but not in third, we get U(-). If not, we get U(x).

Similarly for S and D.

So we can get information about S, U, D.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn't use U to test a different letter. But what other words are there without U?

Let me think: are there words that fit _ O _ N _ without U?

For example:
- ""BOWNS"" is not common.
- ""COWNS"" but C is absent.
- ""DOWNS"" -> D O W N S -> that's a word. But W and S are available. So ""DOWNS"": 1:D, 2:O, 3:W, 4:N, 5:S.

That's a valid word. And it tests D, W, S.

Similarly, ""TOWNS"" but T is absent.

""GOWNS"" -> G O W N S -> G, W, S.

""NOW?S"" not.

""JOWLS"" -> J O W L S -> but that's 1:J, 2:O, 3:W, 4:L, 5:S -> but we need 4th to be N, so no.

""KOW?S"" not.

""LOW?S"" not.

""MOW?S"" not.

""NOW?S"" not.

""ROW?S"" R absent.

""SOW?S"" not.

""WOW?S"" not.

""YOW?S"" not.

So ""DOWNS"" and ""GOWNS"" are options without U.

We can also consider ""BONDS"" but O is in position 2? B O N D S -> 1:B, 2:O, 3:N, 4:D, 5:S -> but we need 4th to be N, so that's not.

Another: ""CON?S"" C absent.

""FON?S"" not common.

""GON?S"" not.

""HON?S"" not.

""MON?S"" not.

""SON?S"" not.

""TON?S"" T absent.

So the only words without U that I can think of are ""DOWNS"" and ""GOWNS"", and they have W which is less common.

We also have ""YOWNS"" which is a word (to yowl), but rare.

So, to test more common letters, it might be better to go with a word that has U, like ""SOUND"" or ""HOUND"".

I think ""SOUND"" is a good choice.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If we guess ""SOUND"", and the secret word is, say, ""BOUND"", then we would get:
- S: not in word -> x
- O: correct and in position -> ✓
- U: in word but not in position? In ""BOUND"", U is in position 3, so if we put U in position 3, it would be correct? But in ""BOUND"", the third letter is U, so if the secret word is ""BOUND"", then in ""SOUND"", U is in the same position, so it would be ✓? No, because the secret word is ""BOUND"", and we are guessing ""SOUND"", so:
  Position 1: S vs B -> not match, and S is not in ""BOUND"" -> x
  Position 2: O vs O -> match, ✓
  Position 3: U vs U -> match, ✓
  Position 4: N vs N -> match, ✓
  Position 5: D vs D -> match, ✓
But that would solve it. But we don't know if it's ""BOUND"" or not.

But if it's not, we get information.

Similarly, if the secret word is ""YOUNG"", then ""SOUND"" would have:
  S: not in ""YOUNG"" -> x
  O: ✓
  U: in ""YOUNG"" and in position 3? ""YOUNG"" has U in position 3, so ✓
  N: ✓
  D: not in ""YOUNG"" -> x
So we get: S(x), O(✓), U(✓), N(✓), D(x)

Then we know the word is _ O U N _ and the first and fifth are not S or D, and we have to find which letters.

But we have more guesses.

Alternatively, if we choose ""YOUNG"", we test Y and G.

But I think ""SOUND"" is a solid choice.

We can also consider that we have only 4 guesses left, so we might want to cover more ground.

Another idea: we can choose a word that doesn't use U to see if U is in the word. For example, if we choose ""DOWNS"", then:
- If U is in the word, we would get a '-' for U? But we are not using U, so we wouldn't know. We would only know about the letters we guess.

If we choose a word without U, and U is in the word, we might not get any information about U. But we can infer from the absence of U in the feedback? No, because we didn't test U.

So to test U, we need to include it in a guess.

Therefore, it might be better to include U to check if it's present.

Similarly for other letters.

So I think ""SOUND"" is a good guess.

Let's go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)  
  This means:  
  - N is in the word and correctly placed in the 4th position.  
  - C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.  

- **Guess 2: ""point""** → P(x), O(✓), I(x), N(✓), T(x)  
  This means:  
  - O is in the word and correctly placed in the 2nd position.  
  - N is confirmed again in the 4th position (already known).  
  - P, I, T are not in the word at all.  

### Current Knowledge:
- **Confirmed positions**:  
  - 2nd letter: O  
  - 4th letter: N  
  So the secret word pattern is: `_ O _ N _`  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, E, P, I, T (these cannot appear anywhere).  
- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, S, U, V, W, Y, Z (and O, N are confirmed but may not repeat).  
- **Goal for next guess**: Test new common letters (e.g., S, U, D, L, M) to gather more information, especially for positions 1, 3, and 5.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- The word must fit `_ O _ N _` and avoid absent letters.  
- Prioritize testing high-frequency letters like S, U, D, and L to maximize feedback.  
- A good candidate is **""SOUND""**:  
  - It fits the pattern: S (position 1), O (position 2), U (position 3), N (position 4), D (position 5).  
  - It tests three new common letters: S, U, D.  
  - If S, U, or D are in the word, feedback will reveal their presence/position, narrowing down possibilities significantly.  
- Alternatives like ""HOUND"" or ""MOUND"" were considered, but ""SOUND"" is chosen because S is a very common starting letter, and U is the only untested vowel available.

Actually, the 4th letter is the second last? Let me clarify:\n\nIn ""crane"", the positions are:\n1: C\n2: R\n3: A\n4: N\n5: E\n\nSo the 4th letter is the fourth position.

But let\'s check the letters: B, L, U, N, T. None of C, R, A, E. So that\'s also a candidate.\n\nBut ""BLUNT"" has N in the 4th position? Let\'s see:\nB L U N T -> positions: 1:B, 2:L, 3:U, 4:N, 5:T -> yes.\n\nHowever, we might want to test more vowels. We haven\'t tested O, U, I yet.\n\nBut in the first guess, we tested A and E and they are out, so we have I, O, U left.\n\nWe can try to include one of these.\n\nAnother common word: ""POINT"" -> P, O, I, N, T. This has O and I, which are vowels we haven\'t tested. And no forbidden letters.\n\nBut note: we must avoid E, and ""POINT"" doesn\'t have E.\n\nSo ""POINT"" is a good candidate.\n\nSimilarly, ""JOINT"" or ""MOUNT"", but we don\'t know if J or M are in the word.\n\nWe can also consider ""SHINY"", but Y might be less common.\n\nI think ""POINT"" is a solid choice because it tests three new common letters (P, O, I, T) and we already know N is in the 4th position.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""POINT"".\n\nBut note: we are not required to have the N in the same position? Actually, we know the 4th letter is N, so we must have N in the 4th position in our guess to confirm? Actually, we already know it\'s there, but we can use it to test other letters.\n\nIn the feedback for the next guess, we will get information about the other positions.\n\nSo, I\'ll choose ""POINT"".\n\nBut wait, what if the word has double letters? We don\'t know, but we can avoid that for now.\n\nAnother candidate: ""MINTS"" but that has S at the end and M at the beginning, and we don\'t know about S.\n\nBut ""POINT"" seems good.\n\nAlternatively, ""STUNG"" -> S, T, U, N, G. This tests U and G.\n\nBut I think ""POINT"" is better because it tests two vowels (O and I) and common consonants.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""POINT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, A, and E are not in the secret word at all.\n- The 4th letter is N (confirmed correct position).\n\nThe secret word format is: _ _ _ N _\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must avoid C, R, A, E.\n- Should test new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, I, O, P) to gather more information.\n- ""POINT"" is a strong choice because:\n  - It has N in the 4th position (using known correct placement).\n  - It tests new vowels (O, I) and consonants (P, T).\n  - All letters are distinct and common, maximizing feedback potential.\n\n<guess>point</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(✓) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)\nThis means:\n- N is in the word and in the correct position (4th).\n- C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.\n\nGuess 2: ""point"" -> P(x), O(✓), I(x), N(✓), T(x)\nThis means:\n- O is in the word and in the correct position (2nd?

However, we don\'t know. We should consider that the word might have duplicate letters, but since we haven\'t encountered any duplicates in feedback, we can assume for now that letters are unique unless we get evidence otherwise.\n\nIn the feedback, we have two correct letters: O and N, and they are in different positions. We don\'t have any indication of duplicates, so we can try to avoid using O and N again in other positions to test new letters.\n\nNow, we need to guess the first, third, and fifth letters.\n\nWe should choose a word that:\n- Has the form: _ O _ N _\n- Uses only the available letters (not in the absent list).\n- Tests new common letters to maximize information.\n\nCommon letters left: S, L, U, D, M, G, B, etc.\n\nWe can try to form words like:\n- ? O ? N ?\n\nPossible words:\n- S O L N ? -> but we need a 5-letter word. ""SOLON"" is a word? Let me check: SOLON is a proper noun? We should stick to common words. Also, note that the fifth letter must be from the available set.\n\nAnother: ""BOUND"" -> B O U N D. But we have the 4th letter as N, so in ""BOUND"": \nPosition 1: B, 2: O, 3: U, 4: N, 5: D -> that fits the pattern.\n\nBut we must check if B, U, D are allowed. \n- B: not in absent list -> allowed\n- U: not in absent list -> allowed\n- D: not in absent list -> allowed\n\nAlso, we are testing three new letters: B, U, D.\n\nAnother possibility: ""MOUND"" -> M O U N D, same as above but with M.\n\nOr ""SOUND"" -> S O U N D.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if S is in the word. We haven\'t tested S yet.\n\nSimilarly, ""HOUND"", ""WOUND"", etc.\n\nBut we also have to consider that the third letter might be a vowel or consonant.\n\nWe could try ""LOINS"" but wait, I is in the absent list (from guess2: I(x)), so we cannot use I.\n\nAnother word: ""BOWLN"" is not a word.\n\nWe need real words.\n\nLet me list some words that fit the pattern _ O _ N _ and use only available letters:\n\n- B O _ N _ : possible words: BOUND, BOWNS (if BOWN is a word? Bown is not common, BOUND is good)\n- D O _ N _ : DOWN? but that\'s 4 letters. We need 5. DOZEN? but Z is available, but E is absent (E is in the absent list). So DOZEN has E -> not allowed.\n- F O _ N _ : FOUND? F O U N D -> but U and D are available. FOUND is a word.\n- G O _ N _ : GOWN? 4 letters. GONAD? but A is absent. GONAD has A -> not allowed. GOURN? not a word.\n- H O _ N _ : HOUND, HORNS? but R is absent. HOUND is good (H O U N D).\n- J O _ N _ : JOU? JOU is not 5 letters. JOUGS? not common. JOULE? but E is absent. Probably not.\n- K O _ N _ : KOW? not 5 letters. KORUN? not common. \n- L O _ N _ : LOINS? I is absent. LOUND? not common. LOUNS? not common. LOANS? A is absent. \n- M O _ N _ : MOUND, MOANS? A absent. MOONS? but O is already used, and we are not sure about duplicates. MOONS has two O\'s. We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. But we can try to avoid for now to test more letters. MOUND is good (M O U N D).\n- Q O _ N _ : not many words.\n- S O _ N _ : SOUND, SOWNS? not common. SOWND? not common. SOURN? not common. SOUND is good.\n- U O _ N _ : not common.\n- V O _ N _ : VOW? not 5 letters. VOWEL? E absent. \n- W O _ N _ : WOUND, WOW? not 5 letters. WON? not 5. WOUND is good (W O U N D).\n- Y O _ N _ : YOUNG? but U is used and G, but YOUNG is 5 letters: Y O U N G -> that fits: 1:Y, 2:O, 3:U, 4:N, 5:G. And Y, U, G are available.\n\nSo possible words: BOUND, FOUND, HOUND, MOUND, SOUND, WOUND, YOUNG.\n\nWe need to choose one that tests new letters. We are going to test three new letters at once.\n\nBut note: we have limited guesses left (4 more after this, since we used 2). We want to maximize information.\n\nWe can choose a word that uses common letters and avoids letters that might be less common.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has letters that appear in many words to get more coverage.\n\nBut note: we are testing the first, third, and fifth positions.\n\nWe can also consider that the third letter might be a vowel (like U) or a consonant.\n\nIn the list above, many words have U in the third position: BOUND, FOUND, HOUND, MOUND, SOUND, WOUND. YOUNG also has U in the third position.\n\nSo if we choose one of these, we are testing U in the third position and whatever in the first and fifth.\n\nBut if we choose ""YOUNG"", we test Y and G as well.\n\nHowever, Y and G are less common than S, for example.\n\nWe could choose ""SOUND"" to test S and U and D.\n\nBut we have multiple words with U. If we choose one and it\'s wrong, we might still not know which one.\n\nBut we are not necessarily trying to solve in this guess; we are trying to get information.\n\nWe can choose a word that doesn\'t have U, to test a different vowel? But what other vowels are available? We have O (already used in position 2) and we have U, and we have Y (which can be a vowel). The other vowels A, E, I are out.\n\nSo U is the only vowel left? Not exactly, Y can be a vowel too.\n\nBut in the third position, we can have a consonant too.\n\nFor example, is there a word like ""BOLNS""? No.\n\nWhat about ""SOLON""? SOLON is a word (a statesman in ancient Greece) but it\'s not very common. Also, it has O twice? S O L O N -> but that would be two O\'s. We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, the second O would be in position 4? No: positions: 1:S, 2:O, 3:L, 4:O, 5:N -> but we know the 4th letter is N, so that doesn\'t match. So not.\n\nAnother word: ""BONUS"" -> but that\'s B O N U S, which would be 1:B, 2:O, 3:N, 4:U, 5:S -> but we know the 4th letter is N, not U. So that doesn\'t fit.\n\nWe must have the 4th letter as N.\n\nSo the pattern is fixed: _ O _ N _\n\nAnd the third letter cannot be N because then it would be _ O N N _, but we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. But we can avoid for now.\n\nGiven the available words, let\'s pick one that uses common letters.\n\nCommon consonants: S, L, D, M, etc.\n\nWe can choose ""SOUND"": S O U N D -> tests S, U, D.\n\nIf we get feedback, we might know if S, U, or D are in the word and in which positions.\n\nSimilarly, ""HOUND"" tests H, U, D.\n\nBut S is more common than H.\n\nWe can also consider ""YOUNG"": Y O U N G -> tests Y, U, G.\n\nBut Y and G are less common.\n\nAnother word: ""DOUGH"" -> D O U G H -> but the 4th letter must be N, so that doesn\'t work.\n\nWe must have N in the 4th.\n\nSo I think ""SOUND"" is a good choice because S is a very common letter.\n\nWe can also consider ""MOUND"" to test M.\n\nBut S is more common.\n\nLet\'s go with ""SOUND"".\n\nBut note: we are using U again? We are testing U in the third position. If U is not in the word, then we know that the third letter is not U, and we can eliminate all the U words.\n\nIf U is in the word, then we know it\'s in the third position? Not necessarily, because the feedback might show it in a different position? But in this guess, we are putting U in the third position. If the secret word has U but not in the third, then we would get a \'-\' for U (present but wrong position). But we are guessing the word as S O U N D, so if U is in the word but not in third, we get U(-). If not, we get U(x).\n\nSimilarly for S and D.\n\nSo we can get information about S, U, D.\n\nAlternatively, we could choose a word that doesn\'t use U to test a different letter. But what other words are there without U?\n\nLet me think: are there words that fit _ O _ N _ without U?\n\nFor example:\n- ""BOWNS"" is not common.\n- ""COWNS"" but C is absent.\n- ""DOWNS"" -> D O W N S -> that\'s a word. But W and S are available. So ""DOWNS"": 1:D, 2:O, 3:W, 4:N, 5:S.\n\nThat\'s a valid word. And it tests D, W, S.\n\nSimilarly, ""TOWNS"" but T is absent.\n\n""GOWNS"" -> G O W N S -> G, W, S.\n\n""NOW?S"" not.\n\n""JOWLS"" -> J O W L S -> but that\'s 1:J, 2:O, 3:W, 4:L, 5:S -> but we need 4th to be N, so no.\n\n""KOW?S"" not.\n\n""LOW?S"" not.\n\n""MOW?S"" not.\n\n""NOW?S"" not.\n\n""ROW?S"" R absent.\n\n""SOW?S"" not.\n\n""WOW?S"" not.\n\n""YOW?S"" not.\n\nSo ""DOWNS"" and ""GOWNS"" are options without U.\n\nWe can also consider ""BONDS"" but O is in position 2? B O N D S -> 1:B, 2:O, 3:N, 4:D, 5:S -> but we need 4th to be N, so that\'s not.\n\nAnother: ""CON?S"" C absent.\n\n""FON?S"" not common.\n\n""GON?S"" not.\n\n""HON?S"" not.\n\n""MON?S"" not.\n\n""SON?S"" not.\n\n""TON?S"" T absent.\n\nSo the only words without U that I can think of are ""DOWNS"" and ""GOWNS"", and they have W which is less common.\n\nWe also have ""YOWNS"" which is a word (to yowl), but rare.\n\nSo, to test more common letters, it might be better to go with a word that has U, like ""SOUND"" or ""HOUND"".\n\nI think ""SOUND"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we might get.\n\nIf we guess ""SOUND"", and the secret word is, say, ""BOUND"", then we would get:\n- S: not in word -> x\n- O: correct and in position -> ✓\n- U: in word but not in position? In ""BOUND"", U is in position 3, so if we put U in position 3, it would be correct? But in ""BOUND"", the third letter is U, so if the secret word is ""BOUND"", then in ""SOUND"", U is in the same position, so it would be ✓? No, because the secret word is ""BOUND"", and we are guessing ""SOUND"", so:\n  Position 1: S vs B -> not match, and S is not in ""BOUND"" -> x\n  Position 2: O vs O -> match, ✓\n  Position 3: U vs U -> match, ✓\n  Position 4: N vs N -> match, ✓\n  Position 5: D vs D -> match, ✓\nBut that would solve it. But we don\'t know if it\'s ""BOUND"" or not.\n\nBut if it\'s not, we get information.\n\nSimilarly, if the secret word is ""YOUNG"", then ""SOUND"" would have:\n  S: not in ""YOUNG"" -> x\n  O: ✓\n  U: in ""YOUNG"" and in position 3? ""YOUNG"" has U in position 3, so ✓\n  N: ✓\n  D: not in ""YOUNG"" -> x\nSo we get: S(x), O(✓), U(✓), N(✓), D(x)\n\nThen we know the word is _ O U N _ and the first and fifth are not S or D, and we have to find which letters.\n\nBut we have more guesses.\n\nAlternatively, if we choose ""YOUNG"", we test Y and G.\n\nBut I think ""SOUND"" is a solid choice.\n\nWe can also consider that we have only 4 guesses left, so we might want to cover more ground.\n\nAnother idea: we can choose a word that doesn\'t use U to see if U is in the word. For example, if we choose ""DOWNS"", then:\n- If U is in the word, we would get a \'-\' for U? But we are not using U, so we wouldn\'t know. We would only know about the letters we guess.\n\nIf we choose a word without U, and U is in the word, we might not get any information about U. But we can infer from the absence of U in the feedback? No, because we didn\'t test U.\n\nSo to test U, we need to include it in a guess.\n\nTherefore, it might be better to include U to check if it\'s present.\n\nSimilarly for other letters.\n\nSo I think ""SOUND"" is a good guess.\n\nLet\'s go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)  \n  This means:  \n  - N is in the word and correctly placed in the 4th position.  \n  - C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.  \n\n- **Guess 2: ""point""** → P(x), O(✓), I(x), N(✓), T(x)  \n  This means:  \n  - O is in the word and correctly placed in the 2nd position.  \n  - N is confirmed again in the 4th position (already known).  \n  - P, I, T are not in the word at all.  \n\n### Current Knowledge:\n- **Confirmed positions**:  \n  - 2nd letter: O  \n  - 4th letter: N  \n  So the secret word pattern is: `_ O _ N _`  \n- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, E, P, I, T (these cannot appear anywhere).  \n- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, S, U, V, W, Y, Z (and O, N are confirmed but may not repeat).  \n- **Goal for next guess**: Test new common letters (e.g., S, U, D, L, M) to gather more information, especially for positions 1, 3, and 5.  \n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- The word must fit `_ O _ N _` and avoid absent letters.  \n- Prioritize testing high-frequency letters like S, U, D, and L to maximize feedback.  \n- A good candidate is **""SOUND""**:  \n  - It fits the pattern: S (position 1), O (position 2), U (position 3), N (position 4), D (position 5).  \n  - It tests three new common letters: S, U, D.  \n  - If S, U, or D are in the word, feedback will reveal their presence/position, narrowing down possibilities significantly.  \n- Alternatives like ""HOUND"" or ""MOUND"" were considered, but ""SOUND"" is chosen because S is a very common starting letter, and U is the only untested vowel available.\n\n<guess>sound</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(✓) T(x)\nGuess 3: sound -> FEEDBACK: S(x) O(✓) U(x) N(✓) D(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback for three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
- N is in the word and in the 4th position.
- C, R, A, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""point"" → P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(✓) T(x)
- O is in the word and in the 2nd position.
- P, I, T are not in the word.
- N is confirmed in the 4th position.

Guess 3: ""sound"" → S(x) O(✓) U(x) N(✓) D(-)
- O is correctly placed in the 2nd position (already known).
- N is correctly placed in the 4th position (already known).
- S is not in the word (new information).
- U is not in the word (new information).
- D is in the word but not in the 5th position (denoted by D(-)).

From all feedback:
- Confirmed correct positions:
  - Position 2: O
  - Position 4: N
- Confirmed letters:
  - O and N are in the word (and in correct positions).
  - D is in the word but not in position 5.
- Absent letters (not in the word at all): C, R, A, E, P, I, T, S, U
  (from all ""x"" feedback: C,R,A,E,P,I,T,S,U)

Therefore, the set of letters that cannot be in the word is: C, R, A, E, P, I, T, S, U.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: D is present in the word, as indicated by D(-) in guess 3.

Also, the word pattern is: _ O _ N _

Since D is present but not in the 5th position, it must be in position 1 or 3.

So possibilities for D: position 1 or 3.

Now, we know:
- Position 1: must be one of B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, V, W, X, Y, Z (but D is a possibility)
- Position 3: same available letters, and D is a candidate here too.
- Position 5: since D is not here, and it cannot be any of the absent letters, but D could be elsewhere. Position 5 must be one of the available letters except D if D is not there? Actually, position 5 can be any available letter except that D is already placed in either 1 or 3.

Also, we cannot use D in position 5 because the feedback says D is not in the 5th position.

So, the word has at least the letters: O, N, D.

With O in pos2, N in pos4, and D in either pos1 or pos3.

We need to guess the 1st, 3rd, and 5th letters, but:
- If D is in pos1, then position 3 and 5 must be filled with other available letters (from B,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,V,W,X,Y,Z) and D is already used? But the word might have duplicate letters? We haven't seen evidence, so we assume no duplicates unless necessary.

Similarly, if D is in pos3, then pos1 and pos5 are from available letters except D.

We must form a valid English word.

Now, let's list possible words that fit:
- Pattern: _ O _ N _
- With _ being from available letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,V,W,X,Y,Z
- And D must be in position 1 or 3.

Option 1: D in position 1 -> word: D O _ N _
- Then position 3 and 5: from available letters except D? (if no duplicate) -> but available are B,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,V,W,X,Y,Z
- Position 5 cannot be D, which we already know.
- Possible words: 
  - ""D O L N ?"" → ""DOLON""? not a common word.
  - ""D O W N ?"" → ""DOWNS"" but S is absent -> not allowed. We must avoid absent letters.
  - ""D O G N ?"" → ""DOG N""? ""DOGNA""? not common.
  - ""D O M N ?"" → ""DOM N""? not 5 letters.
  - ""D O Z N ?"" → ""DOZEN"" but E is absent -> not allowed.
  - ""D O V N ?"" → ""DOVEN""? rare or not word.
  - ""D O L N G"" → ""DOLNG""? no.
  - Consider common words: ""DON"" is only 3 letters. ""DOGMA"" but not pattern.
  Few words fit.

Alternatively, if D in position 3: word: _ O D N _
- Then position 1 and 5: from B,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,V,W,X,Y,Z (available letters except D, assuming unique).
- Position 5 cannot be D, which we know.
- Now, possible words: 
  - ""F O D N ?"" → ""FOD?N"" not common.
  - ""G O D N ?"" → ""GOD N""? ""GODNO""? not English.
  - ""H O D N ?"" → ""HOD N""? ""HODNA""? no.
  - ""J O D N ?"" → ""JOD?N"" no.
  - ""K O D N ?"" → ""KOD?N"" no.
  - ""L O D N ?"" → ""LODEN""? but E absent -> ""loden"" has E? L-O-D-E-N? So has E -> absent letter, not allowed.
  - ""M O D N ?"" → ""MOD N""? ""MODUS""? but not, that would be M O D U S -> but U is absent? Wait, ""MODUS"" has U and S, but both are absent -> not allowed.
  - ""V O D N ?"" → ""VOD N""? ""VODUN""? that's a word (a religion), but let's check: V O D U N -> has U, which is absent -> not allowed. ""VODKA"" but not pattern.
  - ""W O D N ?"" → ""WOD N""? ""WODEN""? but E absent -> ""WODEN"" is W O D E N -> has E -> not allowed.
  - ""B O D N ?"" → ""BOD N""? ""BODEN"" has E -> absent. ""BODY"" not 5 letters.
  - Other letters: F, G, H, etc.

Not many words with ""ODN"" in positions 2-4.

Perhaps ""GOODS"" but not pattern and O repeated.

Another thought: we might have overlooked words. 

Common words with pattern _ O D N _: 
- I can't think of any common English word ending with ""ODN"". For example, ""MODEM"" is M O D E M -> not pattern and has E.

What about ""BOWDN""? Not a word.

Perhaps we need to consider that D is not the only letter? 

But wait, another possibility: position 5 could be D? No, because feedback says D is not in position 5 (D(-) means it's in the word but not in that position).

But in guess 3, ""sound"": D was in position 5 and we got D(-), meaning D is in the word but not in position 5.

Therefore, D must be in position 1 or 3.

But let's list all possible letters for position 1, 3, 5.

Given that D is in the word and must be in position 1 or 3.

Also, position 5 cannot be D.

We also have many absent letters.

Perhaps ""LO"" something? But the pattern is fixed: _ O _ N _

With the third position potentially being D.

Another word: ""BODHI"" but H is not in the 4th position? B O D H I -> not _ O _ N _.

Let's think of words that have ""O"" in second and ""N"" in fourth.

Examples: 
- ""H O L N Y"" → no, that not.

Perhaps ""M O U N D"" but U is absent -> not allowed.

Similarly, ""F O U N D"" has U and F? But U is absent.

We eliminated U? Why? Because in guess 3, U is marked as x? Yes: in ""sound"", U(x) -> so U is not in the word at all.

And S(x) -> not in word.

So U is not in the word? So we cannot have words with U.

Similarly, S is not.

So available letters are: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, V, W, X, Y, Z

And D is present, so the word has D.

Now, words with pattern _ O _ N _ :

With available letters.

Possible:

If D is in position 1: D O ? N ?

? must be available letters: for position 3: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,V,W,X,Y,Z
Position 5: same set, but no duplicates? 

Words: ""DO?N?"" 

For example:
- ""D O B N ?"" → ""DOB IN""? not one word.
- ""D O G N ?"" → ""DOG N""? ""DOGMA"" not pattern.
- ""D O K N ?"" → ""DOK N""? not.
- ""D O L N ?"" → ""DOL N""? ""DOLON""? rare. ""Dolan"" is a proper noun? Stick to common.
- ""D O L N G"" → ""DOLNG""? no.

Not common words.

Another: ""D O W N Y"" → ""DOWNY"" is a word: D O W N Y -> positions: 1:D, 2:O, 3:W, 4:N, 5:Y -> that fits the pattern!

And W and Y are available letters. ""DOWNY"" means covered with soft fine hairs, or down-like.

Yes, common word.

Similarly, ""DOWNY"" is valid.

If D is in position 3: let's say ? O D N ?

Position 1: from available, position 5: from available.

Words: ""H O D N A"" but A absent. 
""J O D N A"" A absent.

""G O D N U"" but U absent.

""L O D N Y"" → ""LODNY""? not a common English word.

"" MOD N Y"" not.

So possible candidates are words like ""DOWNY"" with D in position 1.

Another word: ""GOWNS"" but S absent -> not allowed.

""TOWNS"" T absent.

""BOWNS"" not common.

So ""DOWNY"" seems a valid word.

But is there ""BOWNY""? Not common.

""HOWNY""? Not.

""MOWNY""? Not.

So ""DOWNY"" is a candidate.

Also, what about ""FOWL"" not pattern.

Another possibility: ""DOZEN"" but E absent -> not.

So primarily, ""DOWNY"" fits.

We should guess ""DOWNY"".

But we need to confirm: D in position 1, O in 2, W in 3, N in 4, Y in 5.

And all letters: D, O, W, N, Y.

Available letters? W and Y: yes, from available set.

Absent letters avoided.

And W and Y haven't been tested before.

In the feedback from guess 3, we have D(-), meaning D is present but not in position 5, which is consistent because in ""DOWNY"", D is in position 1, not 5.

If the secret word is ""DOWNY"", then our guess should solve it.

If not, we get feedback.

But are there other possible words?

For example, if D is in position 3: ""HODNY""? Probably not.

""MOD"" something.

Or ""WOD"" but not.

Another word: Let me consider ""DON"" with a prefix, not.

Perhaps ""DONKEY"" is too long.

5 letters only.

""BEIGN"" but not pattern.

Another word: ""LOG IN"" not one word.

Perhaps ""DOVEN"" not common.

So I think ""DOWNY"" is a strong candidate.

We could guess a word that tests more letters.

For example, we know D is in the word, so we can test its position.

But with available letters, we can make another guess.

Since we have position 1,3,5 to determine, and we know D must be in one of position 1 or 3.

We can try to guess a word that has D in position 1 to see if it fits.

For example, guess ""DOWNY"" which has D in pos1 and also tests W and Y.

If we guess ""DOWNY"", it might be the word.

If not, feedback will tell us about W and Y.

Alternative guesses: 

For example, ""DAVY"" not 5 letters.

So let's go with ""DOWNY"".

But let's double-check the feedback.

In guess 3, feedback: D(-) -> D is present but not in pos5.

In ""DOWNY"", D is in pos1, so that would be correct if the secret word is ""DOWNY"".

If the secret word has D in pos3, then what word? I can't find one.

Perhaps ""GO DOWN"" not one word.

So I think ""DOWNY"" is the most likely.

But there's another possibility: the word might have D in pos1 and a different fifth letter.

For example, ""DOWNH"" not word.

"" DOWNF"" not.

"" DOWNS"" but S absent.

So only ""DOWNY"" fits with common words.

We can also consider ""DOWLY"" but that word means doubtful or dour? Not common.

So ""DOWNY"" is the best choice.

Therefore, guess ""DOWNY"".
</think>
Based on the cumulative feedback:

### Summary of Known Information:
- **Confirmed Positions**:
  - Position 2: O (from Guess 2: O(✓))
  - Position 4: N (from Guess 1: N(✓) and Guess 2: N(✓))
- **Absent Letters**: C, R, A, E, P, I, T (from Guess 1 and Guess 2), S, U (from Guess 3: S(x), U(x)).
- **Present But Incorrect Position**:
  - D is in the word, but not in position 5 (from Guess 3: D(-)).
- **Available Letters**: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, V, W, X, Y, Z (since absent letters are excluded).
- **Word Pattern**: The secret word is `_ O _ N _`.
- **Constraints on D**: Since D is present but not in position 5, it must be in position 1 or position 3.

### Analysis for Guess 4:
- The word must start with `_ O _ N _`, using only available letters.
- D must appear in position 1 or 3, as it cannot be in position 5.
- With D in position 1, possible words include ""DOWNY"" (where D is position 1, W position 3, Y position 5) or ""DOWND"" (invalid due to duplicate D and no position 4 N). ""DOWNY"" is a valid 5-letter English word (meaning covered with soft feathers or down).
- With D in position 3, no common English words fit the pattern using available letters (e.g., attempts like ""HODNY"" or ""LODNY"" are not valid words).
- Testing ""DOWNY"" tests three new letters (W and Y) and resolves D's position (if correct, it could win; if not, feedback reveals W/Y presence or positions).

### Conclusion:
""DOWNY"" is the optimal guess to test D's position (in position 1) and maximize information on remaining letters (W and Y).

<guess>downy</guess>",downy,"We have feedback for three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
- N is in the word and in the 4th position.
- C, R, A, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""point"" → P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(✓) T(x)
- O is in the word and in the 2nd position.
- P, I, T are not in the word.
- N is confirmed in the 4th position.

Guess 3: ""sound"" → S(x) O(✓) U(x) N(✓) D(-)
- O is correctly placed in the 2nd position (already known).
- N is correctly placed in the 4th position (already known).
- S is not in the word (new information).
- U is not in the word (new information).
- D is in the word but not in the 5th position (denoted by D(-)).

From all feedback:
- Confirmed correct positions:
  - Position 2: O
  - Position 4: N
- Confirmed letters:
  - O and N are in the word (and in correct positions).
  - D is in the word but not in position 5.
- Absent letters (not in the word at all): C, R, A, E, P, I, T, S, U
  (from all ""x"" feedback: C,R,A,E,P,I,T,S,U)

Therefore, the set of letters that cannot be in the word is: C, R, A, E, P, I, T, S, U.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: D is present in the word, as indicated by D(-) in guess 3.

Also, the word pattern is: _ O _ N _

Since D is present but not in the 5th position, it must be in position 1 or 3.

So possibilities for D: position 1 or 3.

Now, we know:
- Position 1: must be one of B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, V, W, X, Y, Z (but D is a possibility)
- Position 3: same available letters, and D is a candidate here too.
- Position 5: since D is not here, and it cannot be any of the absent letters, but D could be elsewhere. Position 5 must be one of the available letters except D if D is not there? Actually, position 5 can be any available letter except that D is already placed in either 1 or 3.

Also, we cannot use D in position 5 because the feedback says D is not in the 5th position.

So, the word has at least the letters: O, N, D.

With O in pos2, N in pos4, and D in either pos1 or pos3.

We need to guess the 1st, 3rd, and 5th letters, but:
- If D is in pos1, then position 3 and 5 must be filled with other available letters (from B,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,V,W,X,Y,Z) and D is already used? But the word might have duplicate letters? We haven't seen evidence, so we assume no duplicates unless necessary.

Similarly, if D is in pos3, then pos1 and pos5 are from available letters except D.

We must form a valid English word.

Now, let's list possible words that fit:
- Pattern: _ O _ N _
- With _ being from available letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,V,W,X,Y,Z
- And D must be in position 1 or 3.

Option 1: D in position 1 -> word: D O _ N _
- Then position 3 and 5: from available letters except D? (if no duplicate) -> but available are B,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,V,W,X,Y,Z

Alternatively, if D in position 3: word: _ O D N _
- Then position 1 and 5: from B,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,V,W,X,Y,Z (available letters except D, assuming unique).
- Position 5 cannot be D, which we know.

  - ""B O D N ?"" → ""BOD N""? ""BODEN"" has E -> absent. ""BODY"" not 5 letters.
  - Other letters: F, G, H, etc.

Not many words with ""ODN"" in positions 2-4.

Perhaps ""GOODS"" but not pattern and O repeated.

Another thought: we might have overlooked words. 

Common words with pattern _ O D N _: 
- I can't think of any common English word ending with ""ODN"". For example, ""MODEM"" is M O D E M -> not pattern and has E.

We also have many absent letters.

Perhaps ""LO"" something? But the pattern is fixed: _ O _ N _

With the third position potentially being D.

Another word: ""BODHI"" but H is not in the 4th position? B O D H I -> not _ O _ N _.

Let's think of words that have ""O"" in second and ""N"" in fourth.

Examples: 
- ""H O L N Y"" → no, that not.

Perhaps ""M O U N D"" but U is absent -> not allowed.

Similarly, ""F O U N D"" has U and F? But U is absent.

We eliminated U? Why? Because in guess 3, U is marked as x? Yes: in ""sound"", U(x) -> so U is not in the word at all.

And S(x) -> not in word.

So U is not in the word? So we cannot have words with U.

Similarly, S is not.

So available letters are: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, V, W, X, Y, Z

And D is present, so the word has D.

Now, words with pattern _ O _ N _ :

With available letters.

Possible:

If D is in position 1: D O ? N ?

? must be available letters: for position 3: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,V,W,X,Y,Z
Position 5: same set, but no duplicates? 

Words: ""DO?N?"" 

For example:
- ""D O B N ?"" → ""DOB IN""? not one word.
- ""D O G N ?"" → ""DOG N""? ""DOGMA"" not pattern.
- ""D O K N ?"" → ""DOK N""? not.
- ""D O L N ?"" → ""DOL N""? ""DOLON""? rare. ""Dolan"" is a proper noun? Stick to common.
- ""D O L N G"" → ""DOLNG""? no.

Not common words.

Another: ""D O W N Y"" → ""DOWNY"" is a word: D O W N Y -> positions: 1:D, 2:O, 3:W, 4:N, 5:Y -> that fits the pattern!

And W and Y are available letters. ""DOWNY"" means covered with soft fine hairs, or down-like.

Yes, common word.

Similarly, ""DOWNY"" is valid.

If D is in position 3: let's say ? O D N ?

Position 1: from available, position 5: from available.

Words: ""H O D N A"" but A absent. 
""J O D N A"" A absent.

""G O D N U"" but U absent.

""L O D N Y"" → ""LODNY""? not a common English word.

"" MOD N Y"" not.

So possible candidates are words like ""DOWNY"" with D in position 1.

Another word: ""GOWNS"" but S absent -> not allowed.

""TOWNS"" T absent.

""BOWNS"" not common.

So ""DOWNY"" seems a valid word.

But is there ""BOWNY""? Not common.

""HOWNY""? Not.

""MOWNY""? Not.

So ""DOWNY"" is a candidate.

Also, what about ""FOWL"" not pattern.

Another possibility: ""DOZEN"" but E absent -> not.

So primarily, ""DOWNY"" fits.

We should guess ""DOWNY"".

But we need to confirm: D in position 1, O in 2, W in 3, N in 4, Y in 5.

And all letters: D, O, W, N, Y.

Available letters? W and Y: yes, from available set.

Absent letters avoided.

And W and Y haven't been tested before.

In the feedback from guess 3, we have D(-), meaning D is present but not in position 5, which is consistent because in ""DOWNY"", D is in position 1, not 5.

If the secret word is ""DOWNY"", then our guess should solve it.

If not, we get feedback.

But are there other possible words?

For example, if D is in position 3: ""HODNY""? Probably not.

""MOD"" something.

Or ""WOD"" but not.

Another word: Let me consider ""DON"" with a prefix, not.

Perhaps ""DONKEY"" is too long.

5 letters only.

""BEIGN"" but not pattern.

Another word: ""LOG IN"" not one word.

Perhaps ""DOVEN"" not common.

So I think ""DOWNY"" is a strong candidate.

We could guess a word that tests more letters.

For example, we know D is in the word, so we can test its position.

But with available letters, we can make another guess.

Since we have position 1,3,5 to determine, and we know D must be in one of position 1 or 3.

We can try to guess a word that has D in position 1 to see if it fits.

For example, guess ""DOWNY"" which has D in pos1 and also tests W and Y.

If we guess ""DOWNY"", it might be the word.

If not, feedback will tell us about W and Y.

Alternative guesses: 

For example, ""DAVY"" not 5 letters.

So let's go with ""DOWNY"".

But let's double-check the feedback.

In guess 3, feedback: D(-) -> D is present but not in pos5.

In ""DOWNY"", D is in pos1, so that would be correct if the secret word is ""DOWNY"".

If the secret word has D in pos3, then what word? I can't find one.

Perhaps ""GO DOWN"" not one word.

So I think ""DOWNY"" is the most likely.

But there's another possibility: the word might have D in pos1 and a different fifth letter.

For example, ""DOWNH"" not word.

"" DOWNF"" not.

"" DOWNS"" but S absent.

So only ""DOWNY"" fits with common words.

We can also consider ""DOWLY"" but that word means doubtful or dour? Not common.

So ""DOWNY"" is the best choice.

Therefore, guess ""DOWNY"".Based on the cumulative feedback:

### Summary of Known Information:
- **Confirmed Positions**:
  - Position 2: O (from Guess 2: O(✓))
  - Position 4: N (from Guess 1: N(✓) and Guess 2: N(✓))
- **Absent Letters**: C, R, A, E, P, I, T (from Guess 1 and Guess 2), S, U (from Guess 3: S(x), U(x)).
- **Present But Incorrect Position**:
  - D is in the word, but not in position 5 (from Guess 3: D(-)).
- **Available Letters**: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, V, W, X, Y, Z (since absent letters are excluded).
- **Word Pattern**: The secret word is `_ O _ N _`.
- **Constraints on D**: Since D is present but not in position 5, it must be in position 1 or position 3.

### Analysis for Guess 4:
- The word must start with `_ O _ N _`, using only available letters.
- D must appear in position 1 or 3, as it cannot be in position 5.
- With D in position 1, possible words include ""DOWNY"" (where D is position 1, W position 3, Y position 5) or ""DOWND"" (invalid due to duplicate D and no position 4 N). ""DOWNY"" is a valid 5-letter English word (meaning covered with soft feathers or down).
- With D in position 3, no common English words fit the pattern using available letters (e.g., attempts like ""HODNY"" or ""LODNY"" are not valid words).
- Testing ""DOWNY"" tests three new letters (W and Y) and resolves D's position (if correct, it could win; if not, feedback reveals W/Y presence or positions).

### Conclusion:
""DOWNY"" is the optimal guess to test D's position (in position 1) and maximize information on remaining letters (W and Y).",Guess 4: downy -> FEEDBACK: D(✓) O(✓) W(✓) N(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
