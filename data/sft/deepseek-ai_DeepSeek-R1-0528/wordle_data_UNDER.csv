First, I need to make the first guess for a game similar to Wordle. The secret word is a 5-letter English word, and I have no prior feedback since this is the first guess. The goal is to choose a word that maximizes the information I get from the feedback.

A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities. Common letters in English include vowels like A, E, I, O, U and consonants like R, S, T, L, N.

I recall that in Wordle, popular starter words are often things like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ROAST"" because they use frequent letters.

Let me think about letter frequency. According to English letter frequency, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. So, I should include as many of these as possible in my first guess.

Since it's a 5-letter word, I need to pick one that doesn't repeat letters. Repeated letters might reduce the information since if a letter is correct, I only know it's in the word once, but I don't know if there are multiple. For the first guess, it's better to have all unique letters.

Potential starter words:

- ""CRANE"": C, R, A, N, E – includes common consonants and vowels.

- ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E – also good.

- ""ROAST"": R, O, A, S, T – high-frequency letters.

- ""ADIEU"": A, D, I, E, U – focuses on vowels, which might be useful since vowels are often in words.

""ADIEU"" has all vowels except O, but consonants are also important. ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" might be better balanced.

I could use ""RAISE"": R, A, I, S, E – that's also a common one, with R, A, I, S, E all being high-frequency.

""RAISE"" seems good: R, A, I, S, E. Vowels: A, I, E; consonants: R, S – both covered.

Another one is ""SOARE"" but I'm not sure if ""SOARE"" is common; ""RAISE"" is better.

For the first guess, since I have no information, any of these should be fine. I'll go with ""RAISE"" because it has three vowels and two common consonants.

But let's confirm if ""RAISE"" is a valid word. Yes, it means to lift something or increase.

I could use ""CRATE"" or ""SLATE"".

I think ""CRANE"" is a solid choice.

To decide, I can think about which letters give the most coverage.

E is the most common letter, followed by T, A, O, I, etc.

Perhaps ""IRATE"": I, R, A, T, E – that has I, R, A, T, E – all good letters.

""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E – L is less common than R, but still good.

But R is more common than L. Frequency: E (11%), A (8.5%), R (7.6%), I (7.3%), O (7.2%), T (6.9%), N (6.7%), S (6.3%), L (4.0%), etc. So S is more common than L.

""RAISE"" has R, A, I, S, E: R=7.6%, A=8.5%, I=7.3%, S=6.3%, E=11%. Average frequency is good.

""CRANE"" has C=2.7%, R=7.6%, A=8.5%, N=6.7%, E=11%. C is less common, so ""RAISE"" might be better since S is more common than C.

Similarly, ""SLATE"": S=6.3%, L=4.0%, A=8.5%, T=6.9%, E=11%. L has lower frequency.

Therefore, ""RAISE"" seems better: higher average frequency and all letters are common.

""ROATE"" is another one, but ""ROATE"" might not be familiar; ""RAISE"" is standard.

I think I'll go with ""RAISE"".

So for my first guess, I'll guess ""RAISE"".

For the first guess in a Wordle-like game, I need to choose a 5-letter word that maximizes the information I receive from the feedback. Since I have no prior information, I should select a word with common English letters to increase the chances of getting useful feedback. Key considerations include:
- Using high-frequency letters (based on English letter frequency) to cover a wide range of possibilities.
- Avoiding repeated letters to ensure each guess tests unique letters.
- Balancing vowels and consonants for better coverage of the secret word.

Common starter words include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""RAISE"". After evaluating:
- ""RAISE"" (R, A, I, S, E) includes five unique, high-frequency letters: R (7.6% frequency), A (8.5%), I (7.3%), S (6.3%), and E (11%). Vowels (A, I, E) and consonants (R, S) are well-balanced, making it an excellent choice for a first guess.
- It's a valid English word, meaning to lift or increase something, ensuring it meets the game's requirement.

With ""RAISE"", the feedback will help identify correct positions (✓), misplaced letters (-), or absent letters (x), guiding subsequent guesses effectively.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""raise"":
- R: (-) meaning R is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A: (x) meaning A is not in the word.
- I: (x) meaning I is not in the word.
- S: (x) meaning S is not in the word.
- E: (-) meaning E is in the word but in the wrong position.

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""raise"". Specifically:
  - R is not the first letter (since it was in position 1 and is misplaced).
  - E is not the fifth letter (since it was in position 5 and is misplaced).
- The secret word does not contain A, I, or S.

We also know that the word has exactly 5 letters and is an English word.

Now, we need to make a second guess. The goal is to use the information we have to form a new word that:
- Includes R and E (since they are in the secret word) but in different positions than in the first guess.
- Excludes A, I, and S (since they are not in the word).
- Tries to cover new letters to get more information.

We know R and E are present, so we must include them. Also, we should avoid positions where they were misplaced in the first guess.

In ""raise"":
- Position 1: R (misplaced, so R cannot be in position 1 in the secret word)
- Position 5: E (misplaced, so E cannot be in position 5 in the secret word)

Therefore, in the new guess, we can place R in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5? But note: we cannot place R in position 1, and we know it must be in a different position. Similarly, E cannot be in position 5, so it must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

However, we must also consider that the secret word has R and E, but we don't know if they appear multiple times. Since the feedback only showed one R and one E as present (and the others absent), it's possible that there is only one of each. But note: the feedback doesn't tell us about multiple occurrences directly. For example, if the word had two R's, then one R might be marked as misplaced and the other as not present? Actually, in Wordle rules, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback will account for each occurrence. In this case, for ""raise"", we had only one R and one E, and both were marked as present (though misplaced). Since A, I, S were absent, we can be sure that the secret word has R and E, and no A, I, S.

Now, for the new guess, we should try to place R and E in positions that are allowed (i.e., not position 1 for R and not position 5 for E). Also, we need to choose three other letters that are not A, I, S, and are common letters to test.

We have 3 new positions to fill (since R and E will take two of the five positions). Actually, we have to assign R and E to two of the five positions, but avoiding the positions they were in before.

Let me list the positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

Constraints:
- R cannot be in position 1.
- E cannot be in position 5.

So for R, possible positions: 2,3,4,5
For E, possible positions: 1,2,3,4

But note: we are making a guess, so we can choose any arrangement as long as the word is valid.

We also need to choose three other letters. Since we have eliminated A, I, S, we should pick from the remaining common letters. Common English letters (excluding A, I, S) are: E, T, O, N, H, R, D, L, U, etc. But E and R are already included, so we can use other common ones.

We must avoid A, I, S.

Possible letters: B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we know E and R are in the word, so we can use them again? Actually, we don't know if they appear multiple times, but to maximize information, it's better to use new letters. However, we must include R and E at least once because they are in the word.

But note: the feedback doesn't tell us if there are multiple occurrences. For example, if the secret word has two E's, and we guess a word with one E, the feedback might show one E as present (if one is in the wrong position and the other is not guessed) but we wouldn't know about the second E. So to test for multiple occurrences, we might need to use the same letter again, but that might not be efficient for the second guess.

Given that we have limited guesses, it's better to test new letters. So for the new guess, we should include R and E (each once, unless we have reason to believe there are multiples) and three new letters.

So, we need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains R and E (at least once)
- Does not contain A, I, S
- Places R not in position 1 and E not in position 5
- Uses common letters to increase the chance of hitting

Let me think of words that fit.

First, since E cannot be at the end, we can try E at the beginning? Position 1 is available for E.

Similarly, R can be in positions 2,3,4,5.

Let me try to form words.

Option: Start with E? Like ""E _ _ _ _""

But we need to include R somewhere.

Example: ""ENTER"" - but that has E at position 1 and 5? But E at position 5 is not allowed in the guess? Actually, we can place E at position 5 in the guess, but remember that in the secret word, E is not at position 5 (because in the first guess, E was at position 5 and was misplaced, meaning the secret word has E but not at position 5). So if we put E at position 5 in our new guess, it might be marked as absent? No, the feedback marks based on the secret word. If the secret word has E but not at position 5, then if we put E at position 5, it would be marked as misplaced (if there is another E) or absent? Actually, the rules: if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, it's marked as '-'. If the letter is not in the word at all, it's 'x'. But we know E is in the word, so if we put E in position 5, it would be marked as '-' because it's present but in the wrong position (since we know it's not at position 5). Similarly, if we put E in a position where it is in the secret word, it would be '✓'.

But to avoid wasting a position, we should not put E in position 5 because we already know it's not there. Similarly, we should not put R in position 1.

So, for efficiency, we should avoid placing R in position 1 and E in position 5.

Now, back to forming a word.

Let me think of words with E and R, without A, I, S.

Common words: 
- ""TRIED"": T, R, I, E, D -> but I is not allowed (we know I is not in the secret word, so we should avoid I). Also, I is excluded.

""TRIED"" has I, which is invalid because we know I is not in the secret word. So we cannot use words with A, I, or S.

Another word: ""RODEO"" -> has O, D, E, O? But O is repeated, and also it has O and E. But R is at position 1? We cannot put R at position 1 because we know it's misplaced there. So ""RODEO"" has R at position 1, which we should avoid.

""CRONE"": C, R, O, N, E -> positions: R at 2, E at 5. But E at position 5 is not allowed (we know E is not at position 5 in the secret word). So if we put E at 5, it will be misplaced, but we already know that. It's better to put E in a new position to test.

""CRONE"" has E at the end, which we want to avoid. Also, C is not very common.

""BORNE"": B, O, R, N, E -> R at position 3, E at position 5. Again, E at 5.

We need a word with E not at the end.

How about ""HORDE"": H, O, R, D, E -> E at the end again.

""RENEW"": R at position 1? Avoid.

""ENTER"": E at 1 and 5? E at 5 is bad.

""EMBER"": E at 1, M, B, E, R -> but E at 1 and 5? Also, R at 5. But we have E at 5 again.

We need E not at position 5.

Try E at position 1: ""E _ _ _ _""

With R in 2,3,4, or 5.

For example: ""EARLY"" -> but E at 1, A at 2? A is excluded.

""EERIE"" -> repeated E, and R at 4? But has I? No, E,E,R,I,E -> I is excluded.

""ENROL"": E, N, R, O, L -> positions: E(1), N(2), R(3), O(4), L(5). This avoids A,I,S. R is at position 3 (not 1), E at position 1 (which is allowed, since we don't know about position 1 for E). Also, E is not at position 5.

Is ""ENROL"" a word? Yes, meaning to enroll or register.

But let's check the letters: E, N, R, O, L. We are including N, O, L as new letters.

Another option: ""ROUGE"": R at 1? Avoid.

""URBAN"": no E.

""CRUDE"": C, R, U, D, E -> E at 5, not good.

""MERGE"": M, E, R, G, E -> E at 2 and 5? E at 5 is bad, and repeated E.

""PERKY"": P, E, R, K, Y -> E at 2, R at 3, and ends with Y. No A,I,S. E is at position 2, which is new, and R at 3. Also, we test P, K, Y.

""PERKY"" is a valid word.

Another: ""BERYL"": B, E, R, Y, L -> E at 2, R at 3. Ends with L.

But we have to avoid E at 5, which we are.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test common letters.

Common consonants left: T, O, L, N, etc.

""ENROL"" has N, R, O, L. ""PERKY"" has P, K, Y. P, K, Y are less common.

Letter frequencies: T is very common (6.9%), O (7.2%), N (6.7%), L (4.0%), etc. P (1.9%), K (0.8%), Y (2.0%) are less common.

So ""ENROL"" tests more common letters: N, O, L.

Also, ""ENROL"" has E at position 1 and R at position 3.

We know that in the secret word, R is not at position 1, but it could be at position 3. Similarly, E is not at position 5, but it could be at position 1.

By placing E at position 1, we test if E is at the start. If we get a ✓, that's great. If not, we know it's misplaced.

Similarly, R at position 3.

We also test N, O, L.

Another word: ""TROVE"": T, R, O, V, E -> E at 5, not good.

""ROUSE"": R at 1? Avoid.

""DRONE"": D, R, O, N, E -> E at 5.

""CRANE"": but has A, which is excluded.

""TREND"": T, R, E, N, D -> E at position 3? And ends with D. But we can have E at 3. Also, R at 2? Let's see: positions: 1:T, 2:R, 3:E, 4:N, 5:D. So R is at 2, E at 3. This avoids position 1 for R and position 5 for E. Also, no A,I,S. Letters: T, R, E, N, D. All common.

""TREND"" is a good word.

Similarly, ""TREND"" vs ""ENROL"".

""TREND"" has T, R, E, N, D. T and D are common.

""ENROL"" has E, N, R, O, L.

Both are good. ""TREND"" might be better because it has T which is very common.

We could also consider ""OLDER"" but has O, L, D, E, R -> but R at the end? And E at 4? Positions: O(1), L(2), D(3), E(4), R(5). So R is at 5, which is allowed (since R was misplaced at 1, but 5 is new). E at 4, which is not 5. But ""OLDER"" has no new information for R and E? We are testing R at 5 and E at 4.

But ""OLDER"" uses O, L, D, which are common.

However, we already know R and E are in the word, so we don't need to ""test"" them in the sense of presence, but we need to find their positions. So any position is fine as long as it's not the one we know is wrong.

I think ""TREND"" is a solid choice.

Another word: ""GREEN"" -> repeated E and E at 4? But E at 4 and 5? Positions: G(1), R(2), E(3), E(4), N(5). But E at 5 is not allowed, and also repeated E might not be efficient.

So I'll go with ""TREND"".

But let's confirm: in ""TREND"", we have:
- T at 1: new letter
- R at 2: we know R is in the word, but not at position 1. Position 2 is new.
- E at 3: E is in the word, not at position 5. Position 3 is new.
- N at 4: new letter
- D at 5: new letter

And no A, I, S.

This should give good feedback.

We could do ""ROBED"" but R at 1? Avoid.

""BREAD"" has A, excluded.

So ""TREND"" seems good.

Another option: ""PRONE"" -> P, R, O, N, E -> E at 5, not good.

""CRIMP"" has I, excluded.

So I think ""TREND"" is a good second guess.

Therefore, I'll guess ""TREND"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
- R is in the word but not in position 1 (marked as -).
- A is not in the word (marked as x).
- I is not in the word (marked as x).
- S is not in the word (marked as x).
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (marked as -).

Key insights:
- The secret word contains **R** and **E**, but **not A, I, or S**.
- R cannot be in position 1, and E cannot be in position 5.
- The new guess must include R and E (to test new positions) and avoid A, I, S.
- To maximize information, use common letters not yet tested (e.g., T, N, D, O, L) and avoid repeating known incorrect positions.

For the second guess, I chose **""trend""** because:
- It includes R (position 2) and E (position 3), avoiding position 1 for R and position 5 for E.
- It introduces new common letters: T (position 1), N (position 4), and D (position 5).
- It is a valid English word that adheres to the constraints and helps narrow down possible positions for R and E while testing new letters.

<guess>trend</guess>",trend,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""raise"":
- R: (-) meaning R is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A: (x) meaning A is not in the word.
- I: (x) meaning I is not in the word.
- S: (x) meaning S is not in the word.
- E: (-) meaning E is in the word but in the wrong position.

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""raise"". Specifically:
  - R is not the first letter (since it was in position 1 and is misplaced).
  - E is not the fifth letter (since it was in position 5 and is misplaced).
- The secret word does not contain A, I, or S.

We also know that the word has exactly 5 letters and is an English word.

Now, we need to make a second guess. The goal is to use the information we have to form a new word that:
- Includes R and E (since they are in the secret word) but in different positions than in the first guess.
- Excludes A, I, and S (since they are not in the word).
- Tries to cover new letters to get more information.

We know R and E are present, so we must include them. Also, we should avoid positions where they were misplaced in the first guess.

In ""raise"":
- Position 1: R (misplaced, so R cannot be in position 1 in the secret word)
- Position 5: E (misplaced, so E cannot be in position 5 in the secret word)

Therefore, in the new guess, we can place R in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5? But note: we cannot place R in position 1, and we know it must be in a different position. Similarly, E cannot be in position 5, so it must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

However, we must also consider that the secret word has R and E, but we don't know if they appear multiple times. Since the feedback only showed one R and one E as present (and the others absent), it's possible that there is only one of each. But note: the feedback doesn't tell us about multiple occurrences directly. For example, if the word had two R's, then one R might be marked as misplaced and the other as not present? Actually, in Wordle rules, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback will account for each occurrence. In this case, for ""raise"", we had only one R and one E, and both were marked as present (though misplaced). Since A, I, S were absent, we can be sure that the secret word has R and E, and no A, I, S.

Now, for the new guess, we should try to place R and E in positions that are allowed (i.e., not position 1 for R and not position 5 for E). Also, we need to choose three other letters that are not A, I, S, and are common letters to test.

We have 3 new positions to fill (since R and E will take two of the five positions). Actually, we have to assign R and E to two of the five positions, but avoiding the positions they were in before.

Let me list the positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

Constraints:
- R cannot be in position 1.
- E cannot be in position 5.

So for R, possible positions: 2,3,4,5
For E, possible positions: 1,2,3,4

But note: we are making a guess, so we can choose any arrangement as long as the word is valid.

We also need to choose three other letters. Since we have eliminated A, I, S, we should pick from the remaining common letters. Common English letters (excluding A, I, S) are: E, T, O, N, H, R, D, L, U, etc. But E and R are already included, so we can use other common ones.

We must avoid A, I, S.

Possible letters: B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we know E and R are in the word, so we can use them again? Actually, we don't know if they appear multiple times, but to maximize information, it's better to use new letters. However, we must include R and E at least once because they are in the word.

But note: the feedback doesn't tell us if there are multiple occurrences. For example, if the secret word has two E's, and we guess a word with one E, the feedback might show one E as present (if one is in the wrong position and the other is not guessed) but we wouldn't know about the second E. So to test for multiple occurrences, we might need to use the same letter again, but that might not be efficient for the second guess.

Given that we have limited guesses, it's better to test new letters. So for the new guess, we should include R and E (each once, unless we have reason to believe there are multiples) and three new letters.

So, we need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains R and E (at least once)
- Does not contain A, I, S
- Places R not in position 1 and E not in position 5
- Uses common letters to increase the chance of hitting

Let me think of words that fit.

First, since E cannot be at the end, we can try E at the beginning? Position 1 is available for E.

Similarly, R can be in positions 2,3,4,5.

Let me try to form words.

Option: Start with E? Like ""E _ _ _ _""

But we need to include R somewhere.

Example: ""ENTER"" - but that has E at position 1 and 5? But E at position 5 is not allowed in the guess? Actually, we can place E at position 5 in the guess, but remember that in the secret word, E is not at position 5 (because in the first guess, E was at position 5 and was misplaced, meaning the secret word has E but not at position 5). So if we put E at position 5 in our new guess, it might be marked as absent? No, the feedback marks based on the secret word. If the secret word has E but not at position 5, then if we put E at position 5, it would be marked as misplaced (if there is another E) or absent? Actually, the rules: if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, it's marked as '-'. If the letter is not in the word at all, it's 'x'. But we know E is in the word, so if we put E in position 5, it would be marked as '-' because it's present but in the wrong position (since we know it's not at position 5). Similarly, if we put E in a position where it is in the secret word, it would be '✓'.

But to avoid wasting a position, we should not put E in position 5 because we already know it's not there. Similarly, we should not put R in position 1.

So, for efficiency, we should avoid placing R in position 1 and E in position 5.

Now, back to forming a word.

Let me think of words with E and R, without A, I, S.

Common words: 
- ""TRIED"": T, R, I, E, D -> but I is not allowed (we know I is not in the secret word, so we should avoid I). Also, I is excluded.

""TRIED"" has I, which is invalid because we know I is not in the secret word. So we cannot use words with A, I, or S.

Another word: ""RODEO"" -> has O, D, E, O? But O is repeated, and also it has O and E. But R is at position 1? We cannot put R at position 1 because we know it's misplaced there. So ""RODEO"" has R at position 1, which we should avoid.

""CRONE"": C, R, O, N, E -> positions: R at 2, E at 5. But E at position 5 is not allowed (we know E is not at position 5 in the secret word). So if we put E at 5, it will be misplaced, but we already know that. It's better to put E in a new position to test.

""CRONE"" has E at the end, which we want to avoid. Also, C is not very common.

""BORNE"": B, O, R, N, E -> R at position 3, E at position 5. Again, E at 5.

We need a word with E not at the end.

How about ""HORDE"": H, O, R, D, E -> E at the end again.

""RENEW"": R at position 1? Avoid.

""ENTER"": E at 1 and 5? E at 5 is bad.

""EMBER"": E at 1, M, B, E, R -> but E at 1 and 5? Also, R at 5. But we have E at 5 again.

We need E not at position 5.

Try E at position 1: ""E _ _ _ _""

With R in 2,3,4, or 5.

For example: ""EARLY"" -> but E at 1, A at 2? A is excluded.

""EERIE"" -> repeated E, and R at 4? But has I? No, E,E,R,I,E -> I is excluded.

""ENROL"": E, N, R, O, L -> positions: E(1), N(2), R(3), O(4), L(5). This avoids A,I,S. R is at position 3 (not 1), E at position 1 (which is allowed, since we don't know about position 1 for E). Also, E is not at position 5.

Is ""ENROL"" a word? Yes, meaning to enroll or register.

But let's check the letters: E, N, R, O, L. We are including N, O, L as new letters.

Another option: ""ROUGE"": R at 1? Avoid.

""URBAN"": no E.

""CRUDE"": C, R, U, D, E -> E at 5, not good.

""MERGE"": M, E, R, G, E -> E at 2 and 5? E at 5 is bad, and repeated E.

""PERKY"": P, E, R, K, Y -> E at 2, R at 3, and ends with Y. No A,I,S. E is at position 2, which is new, and R at 3. Also, we test P, K, Y.

""PERKY"" is a valid word.

Another: ""BERYL"": B, E, R, Y, L -> E at 2, R at 3. Ends with L.

But we have to avoid E at 5, which we are.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test common letters.

Common consonants left: T, O, L, N, etc.

""ENROL"" has N, R, O, L. ""PERKY"" has P, K, Y. P, K, Y are less common.

By placing E at position 1, we test if E is at the start. If we get a ✓, that's great. If not, we know it's misplaced.

Similarly, R at position 3.

We also test N, O, L.

Another word: ""TROVE"": T, R, O, V, E -> E at 5, not good.

""ROUSE"": R at 1? Avoid.

""DRONE"": D, R, O, N, E -> E at 5.

""CRANE"": but has A, which is excluded.

""TREND"": T, R, E, N, D -> E at position 3? And ends with D. But we can have E at 3. Also, R at 2? Let's see: positions: 1:T, 2:R, 3:E, 4:N, 5:D. So R is at 2, E at 3. This avoids position 1 for R and position 5 for E. Also, no A,I,S. Letters: T, R, E, N, D. All common.

""TREND"" is a good word.

Similarly, ""TREND"" vs ""ENROL"".

""TREND"" has T, R, E, N, D. T and D are common.

""ENROL"" has E, N, R, O, L.

Both are good. ""TREND"" might be better because it has T which is very common.

We could also consider ""OLDER"" but has O, L, D, E, R -> but R at the end? And E at 4? Positions: O(1), L(2), D(3), E(4), R(5). So R is at 5, which is allowed (since R was misplaced at 1, but 5 is new). E at 4, which is not 5. But ""OLDER"" has no new information for R and E? We are testing R at 5 and E at 4.

But ""OLDER"" uses O, L, D, which are common.

So I'll go with ""TREND"".

But let's confirm: in ""TREND"", we have:
- T at 1: new letter
- R at 2: we know R is in the word, but not at position 1. Position 2 is new.
- E at 3: E is in the word, not at position 5. Position 3 is new.
- N at 4: new letter
- D at 5: new letter

And no A, I, S.

This should give good feedback.

We could do ""ROBED"" but R at 1? Avoid.

""BREAD"" has A, excluded.

So ""TREND"" seems good.

Another option: ""PRONE"" -> P, R, O, N, E -> E at 5, not good.

""CRIMP"" has I, excluded.

So I think ""TREND"" is a good second guess.

Therefore, I'll guess ""TREND"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
- R is in the word but not in position 1 (marked as -).
- A is not in the word (marked as x).
- I is not in the word (marked as x).
- S is not in the word (marked as x).
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (marked as -).

Key insights:

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>First, I need to make the first guess for a game similar to Wordle. The secret word is a 5-letter English word, and I have no prior feedback since this is the first guess. The goal is to choose a word that maximizes the information I get from the feedback.

A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities. Common letters in English include vowels like A, E, I, O, U and consonants like R, S, T, L, N.

I recall that in Wordle, popular starter words are often things like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ROAST"" because they use frequent letters.

Let me think about letter frequency. According to English letter frequency, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. So, I should include as many of these as possible in my first guess.

Since it's a 5-letter word, I need to pick one that doesn't repeat letters. Repeated letters might reduce the information since if a letter is correct, I only know it's in the word once, but I don't know if there are multiple. For the first guess, it's better to have all unique letters.

Potential starter words:

- ""CRANE"": C, R, A, N, E – includes common consonants and vowels.

- ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E – also good.

- ""ROAST"": R, O, A, S, T – high-frequency letters.

- ""ADIEU"": A, D, I, E, U – focuses on vowels, which might be useful since vowels are often in words.

""ADIEU"" has all vowels except O, but consonants are also important. ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" might be better balanced.

I could use ""RAISE"": R, A, I, S, E – that's also a common one, with R, A, I, S, E all being high-frequency.

""RAISE"" seems good: R, A, I, S, E. Vowels: A, I, E; consonants: R, S – both covered.

Another one is ""SOARE"" but I'm not sure if ""SOARE"" is common; ""RAISE"" is better.

For the first guess, since I have no information, any of these should be fine. I'll go with ""RAISE"" because it has three vowels and two common consonants.

But let's confirm if ""RAISE"" is a valid word. Yes, it means to lift something or increase.

I could use ""CRATE"" or ""SLATE"".

I think ""CRANE"" is a solid choice.

To decide, I can think about which letters give the most coverage.

E is the most common letter, followed by T, A, O, I, etc.

Perhaps ""IRATE"": I, R, A, T, E – that has I, R, A, T, E – all good letters.

""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E – L is less common than R, but still good.

But R is more common than L. Frequency: E (11%), A (8.5%), R (7.6%), I (7.3%), O (7.2%), T (6.9%), N (6.7%), S (6.3%), L (4.0%), etc. So S is more common than L.

""RAISE"" has R, A, I, S, E: R=7.6%, A=8.5%, I=7.3%, S=6.3%, E=11%. Average frequency is good.

""CRANE"" has C=2.7%, R=7.6%, A=8.5%, N=6.7%, E=11%. C is less common, so ""RAISE"" might be better since S is more common than C.

Similarly, ""SLATE"": S=6.3%, L=4.0%, A=8.5%, T=6.9%, E=11%. L has lower frequency.

Therefore, ""RAISE"" seems better: higher average frequency and all letters are common.

""ROATE"" is another one, but ""ROATE"" might not be familiar; ""RAISE"" is standard.

I think I'll go with ""RAISE"".

So for my first guess, I'll guess ""RAISE"".For the first guess in a Wordle-like game, I need to choose a 5-letter word that maximizes the information I receive from the feedback. Since I have no prior information, I should select a word with common English letters to increase the chances of getting useful feedback. Key considerations include:
- Using high-frequency letters (based on English letter frequency) to cover a wide range of possibilities.
- Avoiding repeated letters to ensure each guess tests unique letters.
- Balancing vowels and consonants for better coverage of the secret word.

Common starter words include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""RAISE"". After evaluating:
- ""RAISE"" (R, A, I, S, E) includes five unique, high-frequency letters: R (7.6% frequency), A (8.5%), I (7.3%), S (6.3%), and E (11%). Vowels (A, I, E) and consonants (R, S) are well-balanced, making it an excellent choice for a first guess.
- It's a valid English word, meaning to lift or increase something, ensuring it meets the game's requirement.

With ""RAISE"", the feedback will help identify correct positions (✓), misplaced letters (-), or absent letters (x), guiding subsequent guesses effectively.

<guess>raise</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""raise"":
- R: (-) meaning R is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A: (x) meaning A is not in the word.
- I: (x) meaning I is not in the word.
- S: (x) meaning S is not in the word.
- E: (-) meaning E is in the word but in the wrong position.

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""raise"". Specifically:
  - R is not the first letter (since it was in position 1 and is misplaced).
  - E is not the fifth letter (since it was in position 5 and is misplaced).
- The secret word does not contain A, I, or S.

We also know that the word has exactly 5 letters and is an English word.

Now, we need to make a second guess. The goal is to use the information we have to form a new word that:
- Includes R and E (since they are in the secret word) but in different positions than in the first guess.
- Excludes A, I, and S (since they are not in the word).
- Tries to cover new letters to get more information.

We know R and E are present, so we must include them. Also, we should avoid positions where they were misplaced in the first guess.

In ""raise"":
- Position 1: R (misplaced, so R cannot be in position 1 in the secret word)
- Position 5: E (misplaced, so E cannot be in position 5 in the secret word)

Therefore, in the new guess, we can place R in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5? But note: we cannot place R in position 1, and we know it must be in a different position. Similarly, E cannot be in position 5, so it must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

However, we must also consider that the secret word has R and E, but we don't know if they appear multiple times. Since the feedback only showed one R and one E as present (and the others absent), it's possible that there is only one of each. But note: the feedback doesn't tell us about multiple occurrences directly. For example, if the word had two R's, then one R might be marked as misplaced and the other as not present? Actually, in Wordle rules, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback will account for each occurrence. In this case, for ""raise"", we had only one R and one E, and both were marked as present (though misplaced). Since A, I, S were absent, we can be sure that the secret word has R and E, and no A, I, S.

Now, for the new guess, we should try to place R and E in positions that are allowed (i.e., not position 1 for R and not position 5 for E). Also, we need to choose three other letters that are not A, I, S, and are common letters to test.

We have 3 new positions to fill (since R and E will take two of the five positions). Actually, we have to assign R and E to two of the five positions, but avoiding the positions they were in before.

Let me list the positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

Constraints:
- R cannot be in position 1.
- E cannot be in position 5.

So for R, possible positions: 2,3,4,5
For E, possible positions: 1,2,3,4

But note: we are making a guess, so we can choose any arrangement as long as the word is valid.

We also need to choose three other letters. Since we have eliminated A, I, S, we should pick from the remaining common letters. Common English letters (excluding A, I, S) are: E, T, O, N, H, R, D, L, U, etc. But E and R are already included, so we can use other common ones.

We must avoid A, I, S.

Possible letters: B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we know E and R are in the word, so we can use them again? Actually, we don't know if they appear multiple times, but to maximize information, it's better to use new letters. However, we must include R and E at least once because they are in the word.

But note: the feedback doesn't tell us if there are multiple occurrences. For example, if the secret word has two E's, and we guess a word with one E, the feedback might show one E as present (if one is in the wrong position and the other is not guessed) but we wouldn't know about the second E. So to test for multiple occurrences, we might need to use the same letter again, but that might not be efficient for the second guess.

Given that we have limited guesses, it's better to test new letters. So for the new guess, we should include R and E (each once, unless we have reason to believe there are multiples) and three new letters.

So, we need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains R and E (at least once)
- Does not contain A, I, S
- Places R not in position 1 and E not in position 5
- Uses common letters to increase the chance of hitting

Let me think of words that fit.

First, since E cannot be at the end, we can try E at the beginning? Position 1 is available for E.

Similarly, R can be in positions 2,3,4,5.

Let me try to form words.

Option: Start with E? Like ""E _ _ _ _""

But we need to include R somewhere.

Example: ""ENTER"" - but that has E at position 1 and 5? But E at position 5 is not allowed in the guess? Actually, we can place E at position 5 in the guess, but remember that in the secret word, E is not at position 5 (because in the first guess, E was at position 5 and was misplaced, meaning the secret word has E but not at position 5). So if we put E at position 5 in our new guess, it might be marked as absent? No, the feedback marks based on the secret word. If the secret word has E but not at position 5, then if we put E at position 5, it would be marked as misplaced (if there is another E) or absent? Actually, the rules: if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, it's marked as '-'. If the letter is not in the word at all, it's 'x'. But we know E is in the word, so if we put E in position 5, it would be marked as '-' because it's present but in the wrong position (since we know it's not at position 5). Similarly, if we put E in a position where it is in the secret word, it would be '✓'.

But to avoid wasting a position, we should not put E in position 5 because we already know it's not there. Similarly, we should not put R in position 1.

So, for efficiency, we should avoid placing R in position 1 and E in position 5.

Now, back to forming a word.

Let me think of words with E and R, without A, I, S.

Common words: 
- ""TRIED"": T, R, I, E, D -> but I is not allowed (we know I is not in the secret word, so we should avoid I). Also, I is excluded.

""TRIED"" has I, which is invalid because we know I is not in the secret word. So we cannot use words with A, I, or S.

Another word: ""RODEO"" -> has O, D, E, O? But O is repeated, and also it has O and E. But R is at position 1? We cannot put R at position 1 because we know it's misplaced there. So ""RODEO"" has R at position 1, which we should avoid.

""CRONE"": C, R, O, N, E -> positions: R at 2, E at 5. But E at position 5 is not allowed (we know E is not at position 5 in the secret word). So if we put E at 5, it will be misplaced, but we already know that. It's better to put E in a new position to test.

""CRONE"" has E at the end, which we want to avoid. Also, C is not very common.

""BORNE"": B, O, R, N, E -> R at position 3, E at position 5. Again, E at 5.

We need a word with E not at the end.

How about ""HORDE"": H, O, R, D, E -> E at the end again.

""RENEW"": R at position 1? Avoid.

""ENTER"": E at 1 and 5? E at 5 is bad.

""EMBER"": E at 1, M, B, E, R -> but E at 1 and 5? Also, R at 5. But we have E at 5 again.

We need E not at position 5.

Try E at position 1: ""E _ _ _ _""

With R in 2,3,4, or 5.

For example: ""EARLY"" -> but E at 1, A at 2? A is excluded.

""EERIE"" -> repeated E, and R at 4? But has I? No, E,E,R,I,E -> I is excluded.

""ENROL"": E, N, R, O, L -> positions: E(1), N(2), R(3), O(4), L(5). This avoids A,I,S. R is at position 3 (not 1), E at position 1 (which is allowed, since we don't know about position 1 for E). Also, E is not at position 5.

Is ""ENROL"" a word? Yes, meaning to enroll or register.

But let's check the letters: E, N, R, O, L. We are including N, O, L as new letters.

Another option: ""ROUGE"": R at 1? Avoid.

""URBAN"": no E.

""CRUDE"": C, R, U, D, E -> E at 5, not good.

""MERGE"": M, E, R, G, E -> E at 2 and 5? E at 5 is bad, and repeated E.

""PERKY"": P, E, R, K, Y -> E at 2, R at 3, and ends with Y. No A,I,S. E is at position 2, which is new, and R at 3. Also, we test P, K, Y.

""PERKY"" is a valid word.

Another: ""BERYL"": B, E, R, Y, L -> E at 2, R at 3. Ends with L.

But we have to avoid E at 5, which we are.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test common letters.

Common consonants left: T, O, L, N, etc.

""ENROL"" has N, R, O, L. ""PERKY"" has P, K, Y. P, K, Y are less common.

Letter frequencies: T is very common (6.9%), O (7.2%), N (6.7%), L (4.0%), etc. P (1.9%), K (0.8%), Y (2.0%) are less common.

So ""ENROL"" tests more common letters: N, O, L.

Also, ""ENROL"" has E at position 1 and R at position 3.

We know that in the secret word, R is not at position 1, but it could be at position 3. Similarly, E is not at position 5, but it could be at position 1.

By placing E at position 1, we test if E is at the start. If we get a ✓, that's great. If not, we know it's misplaced.

Similarly, R at position 3.

We also test N, O, L.

Another word: ""TROVE"": T, R, O, V, E -> E at 5, not good.

""ROUSE"": R at 1? Avoid.

""DRONE"": D, R, O, N, E -> E at 5.

""CRANE"": but has A, which is excluded.

""TREND"": T, R, E, N, D -> E at position 3? And ends with D. But we can have E at 3. Also, R at 2? Let's see: positions: 1:T, 2:R, 3:E, 4:N, 5:D. So R is at 2, E at 3. This avoids position 1 for R and position 5 for E. Also, no A,I,S. Letters: T, R, E, N, D. All common.

""TREND"" is a good word.

Similarly, ""TREND"" vs ""ENROL"".

""TREND"" has T, R, E, N, D. T and D are common.

""ENROL"" has E, N, R, O, L.

Both are good. ""TREND"" might be better because it has T which is very common.

We could also consider ""OLDER"" but has O, L, D, E, R -> but R at the end? And E at 4? Positions: O(1), L(2), D(3), E(4), R(5). So R is at 5, which is allowed (since R was misplaced at 1, but 5 is new). E at 4, which is not 5. But ""OLDER"" has no new information for R and E? We are testing R at 5 and E at 4.

But ""OLDER"" uses O, L, D, which are common.

However, we already know R and E are in the word, so we don't need to ""test"" them in the sense of presence, but we need to find their positions. So any position is fine as long as it's not the one we know is wrong.

I think ""TREND"" is a solid choice.

Another word: ""GREEN"" -> repeated E and E at 4? But E at 4 and 5? Positions: G(1), R(2), E(3), E(4), N(5). But E at 5 is not allowed, and also repeated E might not be efficient.

So I'll go with ""TREND"".

But let's confirm: in ""TREND"", we have:
- T at 1: new letter
- R at 2: we know R is in the word, but not at position 1. Position 2 is new.
- E at 3: E is in the word, not at position 5. Position 3 is new.
- N at 4: new letter
- D at 5: new letter

And no A, I, S.

This should give good feedback.

We could do ""ROBED"" but R at 1? Avoid.

""BREAD"" has A, excluded.

So ""TREND"" seems good.

Another option: ""PRONE"" -> P, R, O, N, E -> E at 5, not good.

""CRIMP"" has I, excluded.

So I think ""TREND"" is a good second guess.

Therefore, I'll guess ""TREND"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
- R is in the word but not in position 1 (marked as -).
- A is not in the word (marked as x).
- I is not in the word (marked as x).
- S is not in the word (marked as x).
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (marked as -).

Key insights:
- The secret word contains **R** and **E**, but **not A, I, or S**.
- R cannot be in position 1, and E cannot be in position 5.
- The new guess must include R and E (to test new positions) and avoid A, I, S.
- To maximize information, use common letters not yet tested (e.g., T, N, D, O, L) and avoid repeating known incorrect positions.

For the second guess, I chose **""trend""** because:
- It includes R (position 2) and E (position 3), avoiding position 1 for R and position 5 for E.
- It introduces new common letters: T (position 1), N (position 4), and D (position 5).
- It is a valid English word that adheres to the constraints and helps narrow down possible positions for R and E while testing new letters.

The secret word is a 5-letter English word, and I have no prior feedback since this is the first guess.

Common letters in English include vowels like A, E, I, O, U and consonants like R, S, T, L, N.\n\nI recall that in Wordle, popular starter words are often things like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ROAST"" because they use frequent letters.\n\nLet me think about letter frequency.

But E at position 5 is not allowed (we know E is not at position 5 in the secret word). So if we put E at 5, it will be misplaced, but we already know that. It\'s better to put E in a new position to test.\n\n""CRONE"" has E at the end, which we want to avoid. Also, C is not very common.\n\n""BORNE"": B, O, R, N, E -> R at position 3, E at position 5. Again, E at 5.\n\nWe need a word with E not at the end.\n\nHow about ""HORDE"": H, O, R, D, E -> E at the end again.\n\n""RENEW"": R at position 1? Avoid.\n\n""ENTER"": E at 1 and 5? E at 5 is bad.\n\n""EMBER"": E at 1, M, B, E, R -> but E at 1 and 5? Also, R at 5. But we have E at 5 again.\n\nWe need E not at position 5.\n\nTry E at position 1: ""E _ _ _ _""\n\nWith R in 2,3,4, or 5.\n\nFor example: ""EARLY"" -> but E at 1, A at 2? A is excluded.\n\n""EERIE"" -> repeated E, and R at 4? But has I? No, E,E,R,I,E -> I is excluded.\n\n""ENROL"": E, N, R, O, L -> positions: E(1), N(2), R(3), O(4), L(5). This avoids A,I,S. R is at position 3 (not 1), E at position 1 (which is allowed, since we don\'t know about position 1 for E). Also, E is not at position 5.\n\nIs ""ENROL"" a word? Yes, meaning to enroll or register.\n\nBut let\'s check the letters: E, N, R, O, L. We are including N, O, L as new letters.\n\nAnother option: ""ROUGE"": R at 1? Avoid.\n\n""URBAN"": no E.\n\n""CRUDE"": C, R, U, D, E -> E at 5, not good.\n\n""MERGE"": M, E, R, G, E -> E at 2 and 5? E at 5 is bad, and repeated E.\n\n""PERKY"": P, E, R, K, Y -> E at 2, R at 3, and ends with Y. No A,I,S. E is at position 2, which is new, and R at 3. Also, we test P, K, Y.\n\n""PERKY"" is a valid word.\n\nAnother: ""BERYL"": B, E, R, Y, L -> E at 2, R at 3. Ends with L.\n\nBut we have to avoid E at 5, which we are.\n\nNow, which one to choose? We want to test common letters.\n\nCommon consonants left: T, O, L, N, etc.\n\n""ENROL"" has N, R, O, L. ""PERKY"" has P, K, Y. P, K, Y are less common.\n\nLetter frequencies: T is very common (6.9%), O (7.2%), N (6.7%), L (4.0%), etc. P (1.9%), K (0.8%), Y (2.0%) are less common.\n\nSo ""ENROL"" tests more common letters: N, O, L.\n\nAlso, ""ENROL"" has E at position 1 and R at position 3.\n\nWe know that in the secret word, R is not at position 1, but it could be at position 3. Similarly, E is not at position 5, but it could be at position 1.\n\nBy placing E at position 1, we test if E is at the start. If we get a ✓, that\'s great. If not, we know it\'s misplaced.\n\nSimilarly, R at position 3.\n\nWe also test N, O, L.\n\nAnother word: ""TROVE"": T, R, O, V, E -> E at 5, not good.\n\n""ROUSE"": R at 1? Avoid.\n\n""DRONE"": D, R, O, N, E -> E at 5.\n\n""CRANE"": but has A, which is excluded.\n\n""TREND"": T, R, E, N, D -> E at position 3? And ends with D. But we can have E at 3. Also, R at 2? Let\'s see: positions: 1:T, 2:R, 3:E, 4:N, 5:D. So R is at 2, E at 3. This avoids position 1 for R and position 5 for E. Also, no A,I,S. Letters: T, R, E, N, D. All common.\n\n""TREND"" is a good word.\n\nSimilarly, ""TREND"" vs ""ENROL"".\n\n""TREND"" has T, R, E, N, D. T and D are common.\n\n""ENROL"" has E, N, R, O, L.\n\nBoth are good. ""TREND"" might be better because it has T which is very common.\n\nWe could also consider ""OLDER"" but has O, L, D, E, R -> but R at the end? And E at 4? Positions: O(1), L(2), D(3), E(4), R(5). So R is at 5, which is allowed (since R was misplaced at 1, but 5 is new). E at 4, which is not 5. But ""OLDER"" has no new information for R and E? We are testing R at 5 and E at 4.\n\nBut ""OLDER"" uses O, L, D, which are common.\n\nHowever, we already know R and E are in the word, so we don\'t need to ""test"" them in the sense of presence, but we need to find their positions. So any position is fine as long as it\'s not the one we know is wrong.\n\nI think ""TREND"" is a solid choice.\n\nAnother word: ""GREEN"" -> repeated E and E at 4? But E at 4 and 5? Positions: G(1), R(2), E(3), E(4), N(5). But E at 5 is not allowed, and also repeated E might not be efficient.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""TREND"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm: in ""TREND"", we have:\n- T at 1: new letter\n- R at 2: we know R is in the word, but not at position 1. Position 2 is new.\n- E at 3: E is in the word, not at position 5. Position 3 is new.\n- N at 4: new letter\n- D at 5: new letter\n\nAnd no A, I, S.\n\nThis should give good feedback.\n\nWe could do ""ROBED"" but R at 1? Avoid.\n\n""BREAD"" has A, excluded.\n\nSo ""TREND"" seems good.\n\nAnother option: ""PRONE"" -> P, R, O, N, E -> E at 5, not good.\n\n""CRIMP"" has I, excluded.\n\nSo I think ""TREND"" is a good second guess.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll guess ""TREND"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":\n- R is in the word but not in position 1 (marked as -).\n- A is not in the word (marked as x).\n- I is not in the word (marked as x).\n- S is not in the word (marked as x).\n- E is in the word but not in position 5 (marked as -).\n\nKey insights:\n- The secret word contains **R** and **E**, but **not A, I, or S**.\n- R cannot be in position 1, and E cannot be in position 5.\n- The new guess must include R and E (to test new positions) and avoid A, I, S.\n- To maximize information, use common letters not yet tested (e.g., T, N, D, O, L) and avoid repeating known incorrect positions.\n\nFor the second guess, I chose **""trend""** because:\n- It includes R (position 2) and E (position 3), avoiding position 1 for R and position 5 for E.\n- It introduces new common letters: T (position 1), N (position 4), and D (position 5).\n- It is a valid English word that adheres to the constraints and helps narrow down possible positions for R and E while testing new letters.\n\n<guess>trend</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: trend -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) E(-) N(-) D(-)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for the second guess ""trend"":
- T: (x) meaning T is not in the word.
- R: (-) meaning R is in the word but not in position 2 (since in ""trend"", R is in position 2).
- E: (-) meaning E is in the word but not in position 3.
- N: (-) meaning N is in the word but not in position 4.
- D: (-) meaning D is in the word but not in position 5.

From Guess 1 ""raise"":
- R is in the word but not in position 1 (since it was in position 1 and marked as misplaced).
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (since it was in position 5 and marked as misplaced).
- A, I, S are not in the word.

Combining both feedbacks:
1. **Letters present**: We know R, E, N, D are in the word. From ""trend"": R, E, N, D are all present (marked as misplaced). T is absent.
2. **Letters absent**: A, I, S, T are definitely not in the word (from Guess 1 and Guess 2).
3. **Position constraints for R**:
   - From ""raise"": R not in position 1.
   - From ""trend"": R not in position 2.
   - Therefore, R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
4. **Position constraints for E**:
   - From ""raise"": E not in position 5.
   - From ""trend"": E not in position 3.
   - Therefore, E must be in position 1, 2, or 4.
5. **Position constraints for N**:
   - From ""trend"": N not in position 4.
   - Therefore, N must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (since position 4 is excluded).
6. **Position constraints for D**:
   - From ""trend"": D not in position 5.
   - Therefore, D must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Additionally, the word must be 5 letters and contain R, E, N, D. There may be other letters? Wait, the word has 5 letters, and we know 4 letters are present: R, E, N, D. So the fifth letter must be unknown, but we know A, I, S, T are absent. Therefore, the fifth letter is something else.

In ""trend"", we have five distinct letters: T, R, E, N, D. T is absent, so the secret word has R, E, N, D, and one more letter that was not guessed yet.

Since we guessed only ""raise"" and ""trend"", the only letters we know are absent are A, I, S, T. The fifth letter could be any other letter not in {A,I,S,T}.

We need to guess a word that includes R, E, N, D and one other letter (not A,I,S,T), while satisfying the position constraints.

Summary of knowns:
- Present letters: R, E, N, D, and one unknown letter (say X).
- R must be in {3,4,5}
- E must be in {1,2,4}
- N must be in {1,2,3,5} (but not 4)
- D must be in {1,2,3,4} (but not 5)

Now, we have to assign positions to these four letters and the new letter X.

Since we have multiple possibilities, we need a guess that can help disambiguate.

We also should prioritize testing common letters for X.

Common letters not yet tested: O, L, U, Y, C, M, P, B, etc., avoiding A,I,S,T.

Now, let's form possible words that fit the constraints.

First, list the possible positions:

Consider E must be in {1,2,4}

Case 1: E in position 1.
Then, R in {3,4,5}, N in {2,3,5} (since position 4 is forbidden for N), D in {2,3,4}.

And the unknown letter X must fill one of the positions.

For example, position 2: could be X or D or N, etc.

But we have to form a word.

Example word with E at 1: ""E _ _ _ _""

Possible:
- E in 1, then position 2 could be: possible letters, but must be one of R,N,D,X? Actually, we have five positions: four positions for E,R,N,D and one for X.

All letters: E, R, N, D, X.

So positions: 1: E, then positions 2,3,4,5: for R,N,D,X.

Constraints:
- R: must be in {3,4,5}
- N: cannot be in 4, so N in {2,3,5}
- D: cannot be in 5, so D in {2,3,4}

Now, try to assign:

Suppose position 2: if not R, N, or D, it must be X? But we can assign any of R,N,D,X to the positions.

We need to create valid English words.

Try:
- ""ENDER"": E, N, D, E, R? Wait, repeated E? But we don't know if there is a repeated E. However, in our case, we have distinct letters so far? We know E is in the word, but it could be multiple? The feedback doesn't confirm multiplicity.

In guess 1 ""raise"", there was only one E, and it was marked as misplaced. In guess 2 ""trend"", there was one E, misplaced. So we don't know if there is another E.

Similarly, R was only one in both guesses.

N and D are new.

It's possible that the secret word has repeated letters? But we don't know.

To be safe, we should consider that R, E, N, D might not be repeated? But we don't have evidence.

However, to simplify, for the guess, we can try to avoid repeats but use the known letters.

But in this case, we have four known letters: R, E, N, D and one unknown.

Since E is already used, but we might have to use it again? For example, if the secret word has two E's? But that would be inefficient to guess with repeats.

To maximize information, we should avoid repeats and include a new letter to test.

So for our guess, we should include E, R, N, D and one new letter (not A,I,S,T), all unique if possible.

So candidate letters for X: O, L, U, Y, C, M, P, B, G, etc.

Now, try E at position 1.

Word: E _ _ _ _

Fill with R, N, D, and X.

Constraints:
- Position 2: Can be N, D, or X (since R cannot be at 2).
- Position 3: Possibilities
- Position 4: Possibilities
- Position 5: Must be R or N? R in {3,4,5}, N in {2,3,5}, D in {2,3,4}

Suppose we put X at position 5? Then position 5: X, so R must be in 3 or 4.

Also N must not be in 4? Wait, N cannot be in position 4.

So if position 5 is X, then N must be in 2,3, or 5? But 5 is taken, so N in 2 or 3.

Similarly, D in 2,3,4.

But position 5 is X, so D cannot be there anyway.

Potential assignment:
- Position 1: E
- Position 2: N (if N is at 2)
- Then position 3: could be D or R or X? But all positions need assignment.

We have R, N, D, X to place in 2,3,4,5.

If N at 2, then:
- Position 3: can be R (since R can be at 3), D, or X
- Position 4: similarly
- Position 5: whatever left.

For example, word: E, N, D, R, ? But position 5 must be X, but if R is at 4, and X at 5.

Words like ""END"" something.

""END R"" with X? ""end"" is three letters.

""E N D X R"" but not a word.

Possible words: 
- ""ENEMY"" but has E repeated, and M? But we don't have N, R, D? We need R and D.

We have to include R and D.

""ERROR"" has repeated R and O, but no D.

With E at 1, and including R,N,D,X, it might be tricky.

For example, ""E D U R E"" -> ""EDURE""? Not a common word.

""ENDOW"": E, N, D, O, W -> but this has O and W, but not R. But we need R in the word? No, our word must have R because it is known present.

We must include R.

Perhaps ""ENDER"": E, N, D, E, R -> but repeated E? And R at end? ""ENDER"" isn't standard, but it might be accepted? Meaning the end part? Or as in gender, but ""ender"" is not common. Better to avoid.

""EXPERT"" too many letters.

Since E can also be at position 2 or 4, maybe try other positions.

Try E at position 2.

Then, positions: 1: ?, 2: E, 3: ?, 4: ?, 5: ?

Now, E at 2 must be correct? No, it might be misplaced if not in position 2 for secret word.

Constraints:
- E is correct only if in secret word position 2, else misplaced.

But we want to test.

Possible words.

Start with ? E ? ? ?

Must include R, N, D, and X.

R must be in {3,4,5}

For example, word: ? E ? ? R  (since R at 5)

Then positions 1,3,4: for N, D, X.

N cannot be at position 4? So N at 1 or 3 or 5? But 5 is R, so N at 1 or 3.

D at 1,3,4.

If N at position 1, then position 3 and 4 can be D and X.

For example: N E D X R ? ""NED X R"" Not a word.

N E something R.

""N E V E R"" -> but ""NEVER"" has E repeated, and V instead of D? Doesn't have D.

We need D.

""N E D G R"" -> ""NEDGR"" not a word.

"" U E R N D"" -> position: U(1), E(2), R(3), N(4), D(5). But N at position 4? N cannot be at position 4 because from ""trend"" feedback, N was at position 4 and misplace, so N not at position 4.

So N not at position 4.

In "" ? E ? ? R"", if R at 5, position 4 cannot be N.

So N must be at 1 or 3.

If N at 1: ""N E ? ? R"" with ? for D and X.

Position 3 and 4.

Possible: ""N E W E R"" repeated E.

""N E V R R"" repeated R.

Hard to include D.

If N at position 3: ""? E N ? R""

Then position 1 and 4: for D and X.

D can be at 1 or 4? Position 4: D might be possible? D not at 5, but 4 is allowed.

For example, ""D E N C R"" -> ""DENCR"" not word.

""W E N D R"" -> ""WENDR"" not common.

E at position 4.

Try E at position 4.

Then, positions: 1: ?, 2: ?, 3: ?, 4: E, 5: ?

E at 4.

Then, R must be in {3,5} (since 4 is taken? R can be at 3 or 4 or 5, but position 4 is E, so if E is at 4, R cannot be at 4, so R at 3 or 5.

Similarly, N not at 4, but position 4 is E, so N must be at 1,2,3,5.

D not at 5, so D at 1,2,3.

Now, possible words:

Suppose R at position 5: then positions 1,2,3 for N? D? X?

And position 5: R.

So word: _ _ _ E R

Must have N and D in positions 1,2,3 and one more letter.

For example, "" _ _ _ E R""

Valid English words ending with ""ER"" are common.

Now, the first three letters must contain N and D, and one new letter.

Constraints: N not at 4? But position 3 is before 4.

D not at 5? But position 5 is R, not D.

So for positions 1,2,3: assign N, D, X.

N can be at 1,2,3.

D can be at 1,2,3.

For example, position 3 could be D or N or X.

Common words:  
- ""UNDER"": U, N, D, E, R -> positions: U(1), N(2), D(3), E(4), R(5). This looks good.
- We have E at position 4, R at 5.
- N at position 2: is that allowed? From ""trend"", N was at position 4 and misplaced, but no constraint on position 2. Similarly, D was at position 5 in ""trend"" and misplaced, so here D at position 3, which is different.
- U is a new letter, not A,I,S,T.
- And ""UNDER"" is a valid word.

Check the constraints:
- E at position 4: which is not 5, so possibly misplaced or correct? We'll see.
- R at position 5: but from first guess, E was misplaced at position 5, which doesn't constrain R at position 5? Only E not at position 5. R could be at position 5? Yes, since R was only constrained not at position 1 and 2.

R constraints: from guess 1, R not at 1; from guess 2, R not at 2; so R could be at 5.

E constraints: not at 3 and not at 5, so position 4 is valid.

N constraints: in ""trend"", N at position 4 misplaced, so N not at position 4. In ""UNDER"", N at position 2, which is fine.

D constraints: in ""trend"", D at position 5 misplaced, so D not at position 5. In ""UNDER"", D at position 3, good.

U is new.

So ""UNDER"" seems valid.

But is ""U"" a common letter? Doesn't matter, as long as it's a letter. And ""UNDER"" is a standard word.

Another possibility: ""ORDER"" but has O repeated? O,R,D,E,R -> repeated R? And O is new, but not repeated if different positions? ""ORDER"": O(1), R(2), D(3), E(4), R(5). But R at position 2? But we know R not at position 2? From ""trend"", R was at 2 and marked misplaced, so secret word R not at position 2. Therefore, ""ORDER"" has R at 2, which invalid.

So cannot have R at 2.

Similarly, ""GIVER"" has I? No.

Another word: ""CYBER"" but has C,Y,B,E,R but no D? We need D.

So ""UNDER"" seems a good choice.

Another word: ""HOVER"" no D.

""POWER"" no D.

With D, we have ""WONDER"" too many letters.

""LONER"" has L,O,N,E,R but no D? We need D in the word.

The word must include D.

Hence, ""UNDER"" is good.

""BENDER"" is six letters.

So for 5 letters, ""UNDER"" with U,N,D,E,R.

U is vowel-like.

To introduce a more common letter? U is common enough.

Another word: ""DINER"" but has I? And I excluded.

""RONDE"" R at 1? Avoid, but R not at 1 constrained. ""RONDE"" might not be common.

So I think ""UNDER"" is fine.

If E at position 2.

Earlier it was hard.

Another possibility: in ""trend"", N was misplaced at position 4. Suppose N is at position 5.

Similarly, D at position 1.

For example, word: D E ? ? ? 

Must include R and N.

R in {3,4,5}

N not at 4? But N could be at 5.

Suppose N at position 5: ""D E ? ? N""

But we also have R to place in 3 or 4.

And E at 2? But we don't know.

Then position 3 and 4: one R and one other letter X or whatever.

But we need exactly R, E, N, D and X, with E at 2.

So positions: 1:D, 2:E, 3:?, 4:?, 5:N

Then position 3 and 4: for R and X.

Now, R can be at 3 or 4? Yes.

Possible words: ""D E L R N"" -> ""DELRN"" not a word.

""D E C R N"" not word.

""D E R R N"" repeated R.

Not easy.

"" D E N T H"" but T absent and no R.

Not working.

Therefore, ""UNDER"" seems the best choice.

So I'll guess ""UNDER"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""raise"") feedback: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)**  
  This reveals that:  
  - R and E are in the secret word, but not in positions 1 and 5, respectively.  
  - A, I, and S are not in the word.

- **Guess 2 (""trend"") feedback: T(x) R(-) E(-) N(-) D(-)**  
  This reveals that:  
  - T is not in the word.  
  - R, E, N, and D are in the word but:  
    - R is not in position 2.  
    - E is not in position 3.  
    - N is not in position 4.  
    - D is not in position 5.

Combined insights:
- **Present letters**: R, E, N, D (and one unknown letter, since only four letters are confirmed).
- **Absent letters**: A, I, S, T.
- **Position constraints**:  
  - R cannot be in position 1 (from Guess 1) or 2 (from Guess 2), so it must be in position 3, 4, or 5.  
  - E cannot be in position 3 (from Guess 2) or 5 (from Guess 1), so it must be in position 1, 2, or 4.  
  - N cannot be in position 4 (from Guess 2), so it must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.  
  - D cannot be in position 5 (from Guess 2), so it must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.  
- The fifth letter is unknown and must not be A, I, S, or T. Common untested letters include O, L, U, C, M, B, P, etc.

For the next guess, I prioritize:
- Including all confirmed letters (R, E, N, D + one new letter).
- Avoiding positions already eliminated for each letter.
- Choosing a word that tests E in position 4 and R in position 5, as this combination fits the constraints and allows for disambiguation, while introducing a new vowel-like letter (U) to test common alternatives.  
- ""UNDER"" is ideal:
  - E is in position 4 (allowed and not previously tested).
  - R is in position 5 (allowed and not excluded).
  - N is in position 2 (no constraint against it).
  - D is in position 3 (no conflict with absent position 5).
  - U is a new letter (not tested, common in English words) in position 1.

If ""UNDER"" is incorrect, the feedback will significantly narrow down possibilities by locking in E and R positions or revealing the unknown letter.

**Guessed word**:  
<guess>under</guess>",under,"We are given feedback for the second guess ""trend"":
- T: (x) meaning T is not in the word.
- R: (-) meaning R is in the word but not in position 2 (since in ""trend"", R is in position 2).
- E: (-) meaning E is in the word but not in position 3.
- N: (-) meaning N is in the word but not in position 4.
- D: (-) meaning D is in the word but not in position 5.

From Guess 1 ""raise"":
- R is in the word but not in position 1 (since it was in position 1 and marked as misplaced).
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (since it was in position 5 and marked as misplaced).
- A, I, S are not in the word.

Combining both feedbacks:
1. **Letters present**: We know R, E, N, D are in the word. From ""trend"": R, E, N, D are all present (marked as misplaced). T is absent.
2. **Letters absent**: A, I, S, T are definitely not in the word (from Guess 1 and Guess 2).
3. **Position constraints for R**:
   - From ""raise"": R not in position 1.
   - From ""trend"": R not in position 2.
   - Therefore, R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
4. **Position constraints for E**:
   - From ""raise"": E not in position 5.
   - From ""trend"": E not in position 3.
   - Therefore, E must be in position 1, 2, or 4.
5. **Position constraints for N**:
   - From ""trend"": N not in position 4.
   - Therefore, N must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (since position 4 is excluded).
6. **Position constraints for D**:
   - From ""trend"": D not in position 5.
   - Therefore, D must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Additionally, the word must be 5 letters and contain R, E, N, D. There may be other letters? Wait, the word has 5 letters, and we know 4 letters are present: R, E, N, D. So the fifth letter must be unknown, but we know A, I, S, T are absent. Therefore, the fifth letter is something else.

In ""trend"", we have five distinct letters: T, R, E, N, D. T is absent, so the secret word has R, E, N, D, and one more letter that was not guessed yet.

Since we guessed only ""raise"" and ""trend"", the only letters we know are absent are A, I, S, T. The fifth letter could be any other letter not in {A,I,S,T}.

We need to guess a word that includes R, E, N, D and one other letter (not A,I,S,T), while satisfying the position constraints.

Summary of knowns:
- Present letters: R, E, N, D, and one unknown letter (say X).
- R must be in {3,4,5}
- E must be in {1,2,4}
- N must be in {1,2,3,5} (but not 4)
- D must be in {1,2,3,4} (but not 5)

Now, we have to assign positions to these four letters and the new letter X.

Since we have multiple possibilities, we need a guess that can help disambiguate.

We also should prioritize testing common letters for X.

Common letters not yet tested: O, L, U, Y, C, M, P, B, etc., avoiding A,I,S,T.

Now, let's form possible words that fit the constraints.

First, list the possible positions:

Consider E must be in {1,2,4}

Case 1: E in position 1.
Then, R in {3,4,5}, N in {2,3,5} (since position 4 is forbidden for N), D in {2,3,4}.

And the unknown letter X must fill one of the positions.

For example, position 2: could be X or D or N, etc.

But we have to form a word.

Example word with E at 1: ""E _ _ _ _""

Possible:
- E in 1, then position 2 could be: possible letters, but must be one of R,N,D,X? Actually, we have five positions: four positions for E,R,N,D and one for X.

All letters: E, R, N, D, X.

So positions: 1: E, then positions 2,3,4,5: for R,N,D,X.

Constraints:
- R: must be in {3,4,5}
- N: cannot be in 4, so N in {2,3,5}
- D: cannot be in 5, so D in {2,3,4}

Now, try to assign:

Suppose position 2: if not R, N, or D, it must be X? But we can assign any of R,N,D,X to the positions.

We need to create valid English words.

Try:
- ""ENDER"": E, N, D, E, R? Wait, repeated E? But we don't know if there is a repeated E. However, in our case, we have distinct letters so far? We know E is in the word, but it could be multiple? The feedback doesn't confirm multiplicity.

In guess 1 ""raise"", there was only one E, and it was marked as misplaced. In guess 2 ""trend"", there was one E, misplaced. So we don't know if there is another E.

Similarly, R was only one in both guesses.

N and D are new.

It's possible that the secret word has repeated letters? But we don't know.

To be safe, we should consider that R, E, N, D might not be repeated? But we don't have evidence.

However, to simplify, for the guess, we can try to avoid repeats but use the known letters.

But in this case, we have four known letters: R, E, N, D and one unknown.

Since E is already used, but we might have to use it again? For example, if the secret word has two E's? But that would be inefficient to guess with repeats.

To maximize information, we should avoid repeats and include a new letter to test.

So for our guess, we should include E, R, N, D and one new letter (not A,I,S,T), all unique if possible.

So candidate letters for X: O, L, U, Y, C, M, P, B, G, etc.

Now, try E at position 1.

Word: E _ _ _ _

Fill with R, N, D, and X.

Constraints:
- Position 2: Can be N, D, or X (since R cannot be at 2).
- Position 3: Possibilities
- Position 4: Possibilities
- Position 5: Must be R or N? R in {3,4,5}, N in {2,3,5}, D in {2,3,4}

Suppose we put X at position 5? Then position 5: X, so R must be in 3 or 4.

Also N must not be in 4? Wait, N cannot be in position 4.

So if position 5 is X, then N must be in 2,3, or 5? But 5 is taken, so N in 2 or 3.

Similarly, D in 2,3,4.

But position 5 is X, so D cannot be there anyway.

Potential assignment:
- Position 1: E
- Position 2: N (if N is at 2)
- Then position 3: could be D or R or X? But all positions need assignment.

We have R, N, D, X to place in 2,3,4,5.

If N at 2, then:
- Position 3: can be R (since R can be at 3), D, or X
- Position 4: similarly
- Position 5: whatever left.

For example, word: E, N, D, R, ? But position 5 must be X, but if R is at 4, and X at 5.

Words like ""END"" something.

""END R"" with X? ""end"" is three letters.

""E N D X R"" but not a word.

Possible words: 
- ""ENEMY"" but has E repeated, and M? But we don't have N, R, D? We need R and D.

We have to include R and D.

""ERROR"" has repeated R and O, but no D.

With E at 1, and including R,N,D,X, it might be tricky.

For example, ""E D U R E"" -> ""EDURE""? Not a common word.

""ENDOW"": E, N, D, O, W -> but this has O and W, but not R. But we need R in the word? No, our word must have R because it is known present.

We must include R.

Perhaps ""ENDER"": E, N, D, E, R -> but repeated E? And R at end? ""ENDER"" isn't standard, but it might be accepted? Meaning the end part? Or as in gender, but ""ender"" is not common. Better to avoid.

""EXPERT"" too many letters.

Since E can also be at position 2 or 4, maybe try other positions.

Try E at position 2.

Then, positions: 1: ?, 2: E, 3: ?, 4: ?, 5: ?

Now, E at 2 must be correct? No, it might be misplaced if not in position 2 for secret word.

Constraints:
- E is correct only if in secret word position 2, else misplaced.

But we want to test.

Possible words.

Start with ? E ? ? ?

Must include R, N, D, and X.

R must be in {3,4,5}

For example, word: ? E ? ? R  (since R at 5)

Then positions 1,3,4: for N, D, X.

N cannot be at position 4? So N at 1 or 3 or 5? But 5 is R, so N at 1 or 3.

D at 1,3,4.

If N at position 1, then position 3 and 4 can be D and X.

For example: N E D X R ? ""NED X R"" Not a word.

N E something R.

""N E V E R"" -> but ""NEVER"" has E repeated, and V instead of D? Doesn't have D.

We need D.

""N E D G R"" -> ""NEDGR"" not a word.

"" U E R N D"" -> position: U(1), E(2), R(3), N(4), D(5). But N at position 4? N cannot be at position 4 because from ""trend"" feedback, N was at position 4 and misplace, so N not at position 4.

So N not at position 4.

In "" ? E ? ? R"", if R at 5, position 4 cannot be N.

So N must be at 1 or 3.

If N at 1: ""N E ? ? R"" with ? for D and X.

Position 3 and 4.

Possible: ""N E W E R"" repeated E.

""N E V R R"" repeated R.

Hard to include D.

If N at position 3: ""? E N ? R""

Then position 1 and 4: for D and X.

D can be at 1 or 4? Position 4: D might be possible? D not at 5, but 4 is allowed.

For example, ""D E N C R"" -> ""DENCR"" not word.

""W E N D R"" -> ""WENDR"" not common.

E at position 4.

Try E at position 4.

Then, positions: 1: ?, 2: ?, 3: ?, 4: E, 5: ?

E at 4.

Then, R must be in {3,5} (since 4 is taken? R can be at 3 or 4 or 5, but position 4 is E, so if E is at 4, R cannot be at 4, so R at 3 or 5.

Similarly, N not at 4, but position 4 is E, so N must be at 1,2,3,5.

D not at 5, so D at 1,2,3.

Now, possible words:

Suppose R at position 5: then positions 1,2,3 for N? D? X?

And position 5: R.

So word: _ _ _ E R

Must have N and D in positions 1,2,3 and one more letter.

For example, "" _ _ _ E R""

Valid English words ending with ""ER"" are common.

Now, the first three letters must contain N and D, and one new letter.

Constraints: N not at 4? But position 3 is before 4.

D not at 5? But position 5 is R, not D.

So for positions 1,2,3: assign N, D, X.

N can be at 1,2,3.

D can be at 1,2,3.

For example, position 3 could be D or N or X.

Common words:  
- ""UNDER"": U, N, D, E, R -> positions: U(1), N(2), D(3), E(4), R(5). This looks good.
- We have E at position 4, R at 5.
- N at position 2: is that allowed? From ""trend"", N was at position 4 and misplaced, but no constraint on position 2. Similarly, D was at position 5 in ""trend"" and misplaced, so here D at position 3, which is different.
- U is a new letter, not A,I,S,T.
- And ""UNDER"" is a valid word.

Check the constraints:
- E at position 4: which is not 5, so possibly misplaced or correct? We'll see.
- R at position 5: but from first guess, E was misplaced at position 5, which doesn't constrain R at position 5? Only E not at position 5. R could be at position 5? Yes, since R was only constrained not at position 1 and 2.

R constraints: from guess 1, R not at 1; from guess 2, R not at 2; so R could be at 5.

E constraints: not at 3 and not at 5, so position 4 is valid.

N constraints: in ""trend"", N at position 4 misplaced, so N not at position 4. In ""UNDER"", N at position 2, which is fine.

D constraints: in ""trend"", D at position 5 misplaced, so D not at position 5. In ""UNDER"", D at position 3, good.

U is new.

So ""UNDER"" seems valid.

But is ""U"" a common letter? Doesn't matter, as long as it's a letter. And ""UNDER"" is a standard word.

Another possibility: ""ORDER"" but has O repeated? O,R,D,E,R -> repeated R? And O is new, but not repeated if different positions? ""ORDER"": O(1), R(2), D(3), E(4), R(5). But R at position 2? But we know R not at position 2? From ""trend"", R was at 2 and marked misplaced, so secret word R not at position 2. Therefore, ""ORDER"" has R at 2, which invalid.

So cannot have R at 2.

Similarly, ""GIVER"" has I? No.

Another word: ""CYBER"" but has C,Y,B,E,R but no D? We need D.

So ""UNDER"" seems a good choice.

Another word: ""HOVER"" no D.

""POWER"" no D.

With D, we have ""WONDER"" too many letters.

""LONER"" has L,O,N,E,R but no D? We need D in the word.

The word must include D.

Hence, ""UNDER"" is good.

""BENDER"" is six letters.

So for 5 letters, ""UNDER"" with U,N,D,E,R.

U is vowel-like.

To introduce a more common letter? U is common enough.

Another word: ""DINER"" but has I? And I excluded.

""RONDE"" R at 1? Avoid, but R not at 1 constrained. ""RONDE"" might not be common.

So I think ""UNDER"" is fine.

If E at position 2.

Earlier it was hard.

Another possibility: in ""trend"", N was misplaced at position 4. Suppose N is at position 5.

Similarly, D at position 1.

For example, word: D E ? ? ? 

Must include R and N.

R in {3,4,5}

N not at 4? But N could be at 5.

Suppose N at position 5: ""D E ? ? N""

But we also have R to place in 3 or 4.

And E at 2? But we don't know.

Then position 3 and 4: one R and one other letter X or whatever.

But we need exactly R, E, N, D and X, with E at 2.

So positions: 1:D, 2:E, 3:?, 4:?, 5:N

Then position 3 and 4: for R and X.

Now, R can be at 3 or 4? Yes.

Possible words: ""D E L R N"" -> ""DELRN"" not a word.

""D E C R N"" not word.

""D E R R N"" repeated R.

Not easy.

"" D E N T H"" but T absent and no R.

Not working.

Therefore, ""UNDER"" seems the best choice.

So I'll guess ""UNDER"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""raise"") feedback: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)**  
  This reveals that:  
  - R and E are in the secret word, but not in positions 1 and 5, respectively.  
  - A, I, and S are not in the word.

- **Guess 2 (""trend"") feedback: T(x) R(-) E(-) N(-) D(-)**  
  This reveals that:  
  - T is not in the word.  
  - R, E, N, and D are in the word but:  
    - R is not in position 2.  
    - E is not in position 3.  
    - N is not in position 4.  
    - D is not in position 5.

Combined insights:
- **Present letters**: R, E, N, D (and one unknown letter, since only four letters are confirmed).
- **Absent letters**: A, I, S, T.
- **Position constraints**:  
  - R cannot be in position 1 (from Guess 1) or 2 (from Guess 2), so it must be in position 3, 4, or 5.  
  - E cannot be in position 3 (from Guess 2) or 5 (from Guess 1), so it must be in position 1, 2, or 4.  
  - N cannot be in position 4 (from Guess 2), so it must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.  
  - D cannot be in position 5 (from Guess 2), so it must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.  
- The fifth letter is unknown and must not be A, I, S, or T. Common untested letters include O, L, U, C, M, B, P, etc.

For the next guess, I prioritize:
- Including all confirmed letters (R, E, N, D + one new letter).
- Avoiding positions already eliminated for each letter.
- Choosing a word that tests E in position 4 and R in position 5, as this combination fits the constraints and allows for disambiguation, while introducing a new vowel-like letter (U) to test common alternatives.  
- ""UNDER"" is ideal:
  - E is in position 4 (allowed and not previously tested).
  - R is in position 5 (allowed and not excluded).
  - N is in position 2 (no constraint against it).
  - D is in position 3 (no conflict with absent position 5).
  - U is a new letter (not tested, common in English words) in position 1.

If ""UNDER"" is incorrect, the feedback will significantly narrow down possibilities by locking in E and R positions or revealing the unknown letter.
