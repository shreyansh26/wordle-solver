We are starting the game. For the first guess, we want a word that maximizes the information we get. 
A good starting word often has common letters and avoids duplicates to cover more ground.
Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U
Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.

I'll choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes both common vowels and consonants.
One example of a good starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E: which are common and includes vowels (A, E) and consonants (C, R, N).

Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also a popular starting word because it includes S, L, A, T, E.

But note: the example in the rules started with ""STORM"" and then ""BRAVE"", but I want an optimal start.

Let me pick ""CRANE"":

C: common consonant
R: common consonant
A: common vowel
N: common consonant
E: common vowel

So my first guess will be ""CRANE"".

For the first guess, I aim to maximize information by using a word with common letters and minimal repetitions. The word ""CRANE"" is ideal because:

We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So the secret word contains 'A', but not in the third position. And the letters C, R, N, E are absent.

For our next guess:
- We must include 'A' since it is in the word, but not in position 3.
- We should avoid using C, R, N, E because they are not in the word.
- We want to test other common letters to gain more information.

Let me think of a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes 'A' in a position that is not 3 (since position 3 was wrong). Possible positions for 'A': 1, 2, 4, or 5.
2. Does not include C, R, N, E.
3. Uses other common letters such as S, T, L, I, O, D, M, G, B, etc.

We also want to cover as many new letters as possible.

Common letters not yet tested: S, T, L, I, O, D, G, B, H, K, M, P, etc.

Considering the feedback, let's try to put 'A' in a different position.

Possible words: 
- Starting with S: SAULT? But we don't know if U and L are good. We need valid words.

Let me list some candidate words:

Option: ""SALAD"" - but 'A' is in position 2 and 4. However, we have duplicate letters? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. The rules didn't prohibit duplicates, but the feedback example didn't have duplicates. We should be cautious.

But the feedback symbols are per letter. If there are duplicate letters and the secret word has two of the same, then feedback might reflect that. However, in our case, we know only one 'A' is confirmed so far? Actually, we don't know. We only know at least one 'A' is present.

To avoid complexity, perhaps we should start with a word without duplicates.

Option: ""PASTA"" - but has 'A' at position 2 and 5? Also we haven't tested P, S, T.

But let's see: ""PASTA"" has P, A, S, T, A. But we are avoiding duplicates? We can use it, but we might get less information.

Since we have limited tries, let's choose a word with distinct letters.

Possible words containing 'A' and excluding C, R, N, E, using common letters.

Common consonants: S, T, L, M, etc.

Idea: include S and T since they are very common.

Word: ""SLATE"" - but we have E? We know E is not in the word because it got an 'x'. So cannot use E.

Therefore, avoid E.

Word: ""TALKS"" - letters: T, A, L, K, S. All distinct and new.

But we can also consider other words.

Another option: ""BASIL"" - B, A, S, I, L.

Both seem reasonable.

We also want to try to place 'A' in a position different from 3. In ""TALKS"":
- A is in position 2 (if we consider positions: 1:T, 2:A, 3:L, 4:K, 5:S)

In the feedback, for ""CRANE"", A was in position 3 and it was wrong. So now we are trying position 2.

Similarly, ""BASIL"": A in position 2.

We could try position 1: e.g., ""ADIOS"" - but that has D, I, O, S and A at 1. But we don't know about D, I, O.

But ""ADIOS"" might be less common? Also, we have S and O.

Anyway, both ""TALKS"" and ""BASIL"" are good.

I think I'll go with ""TALKS"" because it includes T, L, K, S which are all common.

The word we choose should be valid. Assuming both are valid words.

So, let's guess ""TALKS"".

In summary:
- We know 'A' is in the word, but not at position 3. So we are testing it at position 2.
- We are introducing T, L, K, S to see which ones are present.

If we get feedback that any of these are in the word, we can narrow down.

Let me write the guess in the required format.

But note: the response should have <guess> and then the word.

So, my second guess: TALKS.

But let's double-check: 
- First guess CR: CRANE -> A is wrong position (position 3) -> so not in 3.
- TALKS: T at 1, A at 2, L at 3, K at 4, S at 5.

We are testing A in position 2 and also testing T, L, K, S.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word (all marked 'x').
- A is in the secret word but in the wrong position (marked '-'). Since it was in position 3 in ""CRANE"", it cannot be in position 3 in the secret word.

For the second guess:
- Must include 'A' in a position other than 3 (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).
- Exclude the absent letters: C, R, N, E.
- Use new, common letters to maximize information gain (e.g., S, T, L, K).

The word ""TALKS"" is chosen because:
- It includes 'A' in position 2 (testing a new position).
- It introduces new common letters: T, L, K, S (all distinct).
- It avoids using known absent letters.

This guess should help identify which of these new letters are in the word and provide more positional information.

And the letters C, R, N, E are absent.\n\nFor our next guess:\n- We must include \'A\' since it is in the word, but not in position 3.\n- We should avoid using C, R, N, E because they are not in the word.\n- We want to test other common letters to gain more information.\n\nLet me think of a new 5-letter word that:\n1. Includes \'A\' in a position that is not 3 (since position 3 was wrong). Possible positions for \'A\': 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n2. Does not include C, R, N, E.\n3.

But we don\'t know if U and L are good. We need valid words.\n\nLet me list some candidate words:\n\nOption: ""SALAD"" - but \'A\' is in position 2 and 4. However, we have duplicate letters? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. The rules didn\'t prohibit duplicates, but the feedback example didn\'t have duplicates. We should be cautious.\n\nBut the feedback symbols are per letter. If there are duplicate letters and the secret word has two of the same, then feedback might reflect that. However, in our case, we know only one \'A\' is confirmed so far? Actually, we don\'t know. We only know at least one \'A\' is present.\n\nTo avoid complexity, perhaps we should start with a word without duplicates.\n\nOption: ""PASTA"" - but has \'A\' at position 2 and 5? Also we haven\'t tested P, S, T.\n\nBut let\'s see: ""PASTA"" has P, A, S, T, A. But we are avoiding duplicates? We can use it, but we might get less information.\n\nSince we have limited tries, let\'s choose a word with distinct letters.\n\nPossible words containing \'A\' and excluding C, R, N, E, using common letters.\n\nCommon consonants: S, T, L, M, etc.\n\nIdea: include S and T since they are very common.\n\nWord: ""SLATE"" - but we have E? We know E is not in the word because it got an \'x\'. So cannot use E.\n\nTherefore, avoid E.\n\nWord: ""TALKS"" - letters: T, A, L, K, S. All distinct and new.\n\nBut we can also consider other words.\n\nAnother option: ""BASIL"" - B, A, S, I, L.\n\nBoth seem reasonable.\n\nWe also want to try to place \'A\' in a position different from 3. In ""TALKS"":\n- A is in position 2 (if we consider positions: 1:T, 2:A, 3:L, 4:K, 5:S)\n\nIn the feedback, for ""CRANE"", A was in position 3 and it was wrong. So now we are trying position 2.\n\nSimilarly, ""BASIL"": A in position 2.\n\nWe could try position 1: e.g., ""ADIOS"" - but that has D, I, O, S and A at 1. But we don\'t know about D, I, O.\n\nBut ""ADIOS"" might be less common? Also, we have S and O.\n\nAnyway, both ""TALKS"" and ""BASIL"" are good.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""TALKS"" because it includes T, L, K, S which are all common.\n\nThe word we choose should be valid. Assuming both are valid words.\n\nSo, let\'s guess ""TALKS"".\n\nIn summary:\n- We know \'A\' is in the word, but not at position 3. So we are testing it at position 2.\n- We are introducing T, L, K, S to see which ones are present.\n\nIf we get feedback that any of these are in the word, we can narrow down.\n\nLet me write the guess in the required format.\n\nBut note: the response should have <guess> and then the word.\n\nSo, my second guess: TALKS.\n\nBut let\'s double-check: \n- First guess CR: CRANE -> A is wrong position (position 3) -> so not in 3.\n- TALKS: T at 1, A at 2, L at 3, K at 4, S at 5.\n\nWe are testing A in position 2 and also testing T, L, K, S.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word (all marked \'x\').\n- A is in the secret word but in the wrong position (marked \'-\').

We are given previous feedback:
Guess 1: CRANE -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)

This tells us:
- A is in the secret word but not in position 3 (since it was in position 3 of CRANE and marked as wrong position).
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

For the second guess, we need to:
1. Include A (because we know it's in the word) but not in position 3.
2. Avoid using C, R, N, E.
3. Choose a word with letters that are common in 5-letter words to gain more information.

Considering words that include A and positions to try A:
- A can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since position 3 is eliminated).
- We also want to cover other common letters. Letters like S, T, L, I, O, U, etc., are good choices because they appear frequently.

Possible words:
- Trying A in position 2: words like SALTY, SAULT, etc. But we have limited knowledge of what's available.
- We need a word that uses new letters to maximize information.

A good candidate is ""TALKS"":
- T in position 1
- A in position 2 (new position for A)
- L in position 3
- K in position 4
- S in position 5

This word uses A in a different position and introduces T, L, K, S – all common letters not ruled out.

Alternative: ""PLAIT"" but it has I and T, and A in position 3? Wait, no: PLAIT would have A in position 3? Let's check:
P-L-A-I-T -> position 3: A? But we cannot put A in position 3. So no.

Or ""STALK""? But S and T are new, A in position 3? No, because A cannot be in position 3. ""STALK"" has A in position 3? Yes: S-T-A-L-K -> position 3 is A. So invalid for A position.

Therefore, ""TALKS"" is valid with A in position 2.

Another candidate: ""PASTA"" but it has P and S, but also two A's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed. Since we haven't ruled out duplicates, but the feedback hasn't indicated any duplicate issues. But we want distinct letters to maximize information. ""PASTA"" has duplicate A? P-A-S-T-A -> two A's. It might cause confusion if the word has only one A. Better to avoid duplicates.

""TALKS"" has all distinct letters: T, A, L, K, S.

So we choose ""TALKS"".

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. For the first guess, we want a word that maximizes the information we get. 
A good starting word often has common letters and avoids duplicates to cover more ground.
Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U
Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.

I'll choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes both common vowels and consonants.
One example of a good starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E: which are common and includes vowels (A, E) and consonants (C, R, N).

Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also a popular starting word because it includes S, L, A, T, E.

But note: the example in the rules started with ""STORM"" and then ""BRAVE"", but I want an optimal start.

Let me pick ""CRANE"":

C: common consonant
R: common consonant
A: common vowel
N: common consonant
E: common vowel

So my first guess will be ""CRANE"".

But note: the problem says to respond in the format: <guess>CRANE</guess>For the first guess, I aim to maximize information by using a word with common letters and minimal repetitions. The word ""CRANE"" is ideal because:
- It contains common vowels (A, E) and consonants (C, R, N)

- It balances high-frequency letters that appear in many English words, helping narrow down future guesses efficiently.

The word ""CRANE"" is ideal because:\n- It contains common vowels (A, E) and consonants (C, R, N)\n- All letters are distinct, covering 5 different possibilities\n- It balances high-frequency letters that appear in many English words, helping narrow down future guesses efficiently.\n\n<guess>CRANE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nSo the secret word contains \'A\', but not in the third position. And the letters C, R, N, E are absent.\n\nFor our next guess:\n- We must include \'A\' since it is in the word, but not in position 3.\n- We should avoid using C, R, N, E because they are not in the word.\n- We want to test other common letters to gain more information.\n\nLet me think of a new 5-letter word that:\n1. Includes \'A\' in a position that is not 3 (since position 3 was wrong). Possible positions for \'A\': 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n2. Does not include C, R, N, E.\n3. Uses other common letters such as S, T, L, I, O, D, M, G, B, etc.\n\nWe also want to cover as many new letters as possible.\n\nCommon letters not yet tested: S, T, L, I, O, D, G, B, H, K, M, P, etc.\n\nConsidering the feedback, let\'s try to put \'A\' in a different position.\n\nPossible words: \n- Starting with S: SAULT? But we don\'t know if U and L are good. We need valid words.\n\nLet me list some candidate words:\n\nOption: ""SALAD"" - but \'A\' is in position 2 and 4. However, we have duplicate letters? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. The rules didn\'t prohibit duplicates, but the feedback example didn\'t have duplicates. We should be cautious.\n\nBut the feedback symbols are per letter. If there are duplicate letters and the secret word has two of the same, then feedback might reflect that. However, in our case, we know only one \'A\' is confirmed so far? Actually, we don\'t know. We only know at least one \'A\' is present.\n\nTo avoid complexity, perhaps we should start with a word without duplicates.\n\nOption: ""PASTA"" - but has \'A\' at position 2 and 5? Also we haven\'t tested P, S, T.\n\nBut let\'s see: ""PASTA"" has P, A, S, T, A. But we are avoiding duplicates? We can use it, but we might get less information.\n\nSince we have limited tries, let\'s choose a word with distinct letters.\n\nPossible words containing \'A\' and excluding C, R, N, E, using common letters.\n\nCommon consonants: S, T, L, M, etc.\n\nIdea: include S and T since they are very common.\n\nWord: ""SLATE"" - but we have E? We know E is not in the word because it got an \'x\'. So cannot use E.\n\nTherefore, avoid E.\n\nWord: ""TALKS"" - letters: T, A, L, K, S. All distinct and new.\n\nBut we can also consider other words.\n\nAnother option: ""BASIL"" - B, A, S, I, L.\n\nBoth seem reasonable.\n\nWe also want to try to place \'A\' in a position different from 3. In ""TALKS"":\n- A is in position 2 (if we consider positions: 1:T, 2:A, 3:L, 4:K, 5:S)\n\nIn the feedback, for ""CRANE"", A was in position 3 and it was wrong. So now we are trying position 2.\n\nSimilarly, ""BASIL"": A in position 2.\n\nWe could try position 1: e.g., ""ADIOS"" - but that has D, I, O, S and A at 1. But we don\'t know about D, I, O.\n\nBut ""ADIOS"" might be less common? Also, we have S and O.\n\nAnyway, both ""TALKS"" and ""BASIL"" are good.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""TALKS"" because it includes T, L, K, S which are all common.\n\nThe word we choose should be valid. Assuming both are valid words.\n\nSo, let\'s guess ""TALKS"".\n\nIn summary:\n- We know \'A\' is in the word, but not at position 3. So we are testing it at position 2.\n- We are introducing T, L, K, S to see which ones are present.\n\nIf we get feedback that any of these are in the word, we can narrow down.\n\nLet me write the guess in the required format.\n\nBut note: the response should have <guess> and then the word.\n\nSo, my second guess: TALKS.\n\nBut let\'s double-check: \n- First guess CR: CRANE -> A is wrong position (position 3) -> so not in 3.\n- TALKS: T at 1, A at 2, L at 3, K at 4, S at 5.\n\nWe are testing A in position 2 and also testing T, L, K, S.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word (all marked \'x\').\n- A is in the secret word but in the wrong position (marked \'-\').

No, because A cannot be in position 3. ""STALK"" has A in position 3? Yes: S-T-A-L-K -> position 3 is A.

We have two sets of feedback:
1. **CRANE**: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x) → A is in the word but not in position 3.
2. **TALKS**: T(x), A(-), L(x), K(x), S(-) → 
   - A is marked wrong position again. Since it was in position 2 here, it cannot be in position 2 either.
   - S is marked wrong position (so S is in the word but not in position 5).
   - T, L, K are not in the word.

Current knowledge:
- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, T, L, K (cannot be in the word).
- **Present letters with positions ruled out**:
  - A: cannot be in position 3 (from CRANE) and cannot be in position 2 (from TALKS). So it must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
  - S: cannot be in position 5. So S must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Since S is in the word (but not position 5) and A is in the word (but not positions 2 or 3), possible positions:
- A: positions 1, 4, 5
- S: positions 1, 2, 3, 4

Also, note that the word has 5 letters, and we need a word that includes both A and S, and excludes the absent letters.

We must also use only letters that are either A, S, or new letters not yet tested (since we know T, L, K are absent).

List of absent letters: C, R, N, E, T, L, K → 7 letters ruled out.

We have 26 - 7 = 19 letters potentially available, but we should prioritize common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

New guess must:
- Include A (in position 1, 4, or 5)
- Include S (in position 1, 2, 3, or 4, but note positions cannot overlap)
- Avoid using any absent letters: C, R, N, E, T, L, K

Possible word ideas:

- Option 1: Place A in position 1 and S in position 4? Example: A _ _ S _
- Option 2: Place A in position 4 and S in position 1? Example: S _ _ A _
- Option 3: Place A in position 5 and S in position 1? Example: S _ _ _ A

We need to fill the other two blanks with new letters. Let's brainstorm:

For Option 1 (A _ _ S _):
- Words: ABIAS? That has two A's. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Alternatively: ACHAS? But C is not allowed (absent). Or ADIOS? But O and I are allowed? ADIOS: A, D, I, O, S → letters: D, I, O are new.

ADIOS: A in pos1, S in pos5? But S is in pos5? That would be invalid because TALKS had S in pos5 marked wrong, so S cannot be in pos5. Therefore, S must be in pos4? Then if word is A _ _ S _, then S is in pos4. Then the last position is blank. For example: ""AMBOS"" - but it has M, B, O. But S in pos5? No, AMBOS: A M B O S → S is in pos5 → invalid! So we must put S in position 4? Then the word shape: A ?1 ?2 S ?5. Then ?5 must be a letter.

Another idea: ""APSIS"" but S repeated. Or ""AXIS"" - only 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

Alternative: Place A in position 4 and S in position 1? So: S _ _ A _

Words: SOFAS? But O, F, A, S. Positions: S(1), O(2), F(3), A(4), S(5) -> S repeated and position 5 for S is invalid because TALKS S was in pos5 marked wrong. So S cannot be at end.

SOFAS has S at start and end? That would require S to appear twice? But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. However, TALKS S was marked '-' meaning S is in the word but not position 5, but it doesn't say how many S's. So there could be two S's? But we avoid duplicates to get clearer info.

Better to assume no duplicates unless forced? So let's avoid duplicates for now if possible.

Back to positions:
- A must be in 1,4,5
- S must be in 1,2,3,4 but note: position 1 cannot be shared with A unless we have two letters? No, each position is unique.

So to avoid conflict, let's not put both in position 1. We can put S in 1 and A in 4? Or S in 1 and A in 5? Or S in 4 and A in 1? Etc.

Try S in position 1 and A in position 4: word ""S _ _ A _""

Common words: ""SPOAS""? Not standard. ""SHOAS""? Not common.

Perhaps ""SWAGY""? Not a word.

Another: ""SUDAS""? Not word.

Alternatively, place A in position 1 and S in position 4: word ""A _ _ S _""

Examples: ""ABASS"" - not valid. ""ADISS"" - no. ""APHIS"" - 5 letters? A P H I S → positions: A(1), P(2), H(3), I(4)? Wait, if S is in pos5? We need S in pos4? Then word like: ""AMISS"" but S at the end? It's pos5: A M I S S → S in pos4? In AMISS: positions: A(1), M(2), I(3), S(4), S(5). But S(5) is invalid because TALKS S in pos5 was wrong. Also, S repeated.

Alternative: ""AISLE"" → A(1), I(2), S(3), L(4), E(5). But L(4) is L? But L is absent! Because TALKS L was marked x. And E is absent (from CRANE). So cannot use L or E.

We must avoid absent letters: C, R, N, E, T, L, K.

Let's list allowed letters: Alphabet minus absent: A, B, D, F, G, H, I, M, O, P, S, U, V, W, Y, etc. (and S is present, A is present).

Try a word with A in position 4 and S in position 3? But we need to fill others.

Another idea: Place A in position 5? Since it must be in 1,4,5 and we haven't tested 5 or 1.

Consider: S in position 1 and A in position 5: _ _ _ _ A → but we have S first. Word: S _ _ _ A

Examples: ""SOFTA"" -> T and A? T is absent, so no.

""SQUAB"" -> Q,U,A,B → but A is in position 5? Positions: S(1), Q(2), U(3), A(4)? Wait, A is in position 4? But we put A in position 5? In SQUAB: A is in position5? SQUAB: S Q U A B → A at position 4? Actually: S(1), Q(2), U(3), A(4), B(5). So A at 4 → valid? We want A at 5? But it's at 4? We can have A at 4? Positions for A: 1,4,5 are all possible.

But SQUAB: Q is rare? And U, B. Also, S at 1 is tested? But in TALKS, S was at 5 and marked wrong position, which tells us S is present but not 5. Doesn't say about other positions.

S in position 1 might be okay? But we can test it.

Better word: ""SWOYA""? Not valid.

Maybe ""SHIVA"" -> S H I V A → positions: S(1), H(2), I(3), V(4), A(5). This has A in position 5 (not tested before) and S in position 1 (new position). Letters: H, I, V are new.

But is SHIVA a common word? In word games, it is often accepted.

Another: ""SKIMP"" but K is absent.

Avoid K.

Let's think of words with S and A that fit the constraints.

Perhaps: ""PIOUS"" but no A? Must include A.

""AUDIO"" → A U D I O → A(1), then U(2), D(3), I(4), O(5). But S is not included? We must include S because we know it's in the word? Yes! From TALKS feedback, S is present and must be included.

So the word must have both A and S.

Ignored that earlier? Yes! Because we know S is in the word (marked '-' in TALKS position 5).

So the guess must include A and S.

Thus, we need a word containing A and S, with positions:
- A not in 2 or 3 → positions 1,4,5
- S not in 5 → positions 1,2,3,4

And exclude C,R,N,E,T,L,K.

Possible configurations:

Case 1: A in position 1, S in position 2,3, or 4? Avoid S in 1 since it would conflict? No, if A is at 1, S cannot be at 1. So S at 2,3, or 4.

Example: A in pos1, S in pos2: ""A S _ _ _""
- Words: ""ASSAY"" → two S and Y? Positions: A(1), S(2), S(3), A(4)? No, ASSAY: A S S A Y → S in 2 and 3? But we don't know duplicates. And A at1 and4? Might be confusing. Avoid duplicates? Better: ""ASKED"" but K and E absent.

No good.

A in pos1, S in pos3: ""A _ S _ _""
- Words: ""AISLE"" → A(1), I(2), S(3), L(4), E(5) → but L and E absent → invalid.

""AMUSE""→ A(1), M(2), U(3), S(4), E(5) → E absent? E forbidden (CRANE x). So no.

""APHIS"" → A(1), P(2), H(3), I(4), S(5)? But S(5) is invalid because TALKS showed S cannot be at5. So no. We need S not at5? So in ""A _ S _ _"", if S is pos3, then the last two positions must not be S? But we need to avoid S at5.

In this case, S at3 is allowed? TALKS said S not at5, not about pos3.

But in word like ""APHIS"" it would have S at5? Which is bad. So we need a word for positions: A(1), then S in pos3, and the last two non-S? Example: ""ADZES"" → A(1), D(2), Z(3), E(4), S(5) → S@5 invalid and E absent. 

Case: A in pos1, S in pos4: ""A _ _ S _""
Then the word has pattern ""A ?1 ?2 S ?5""
We must fill ?1, ?2, ?5 with allowed letters excluding C,R,N,E,T,L,K.
Also, ?5 cannot be S? OK.

?1 and ?2: new letters.
Possible words: ""ABYSS"" → duplicate S and S at5? No: A B Y S S → S at4 and5 → S@5 invalid.
""ADOSS"" → D, O → S at4 and5? No.
""No? What about ""APESH""? Not a word.

Another: ""AMASS"" → A M A S S → duplicate A and S, and S@5? Invalid.

""AVOID"" → no S.

Hard to find. Try other positions.

Alternative: Place S in position 1, and A in position 4: ""S _ _ A _""
Then pattern: S ?2 ?3 A ?5
- ?5 must not be S (if there's only one S? But could be repeated? Avoid to be safe).
- ?2 and ?3: new letters.

Words: ""SPICA"" → S P I C A → C absent. Forbidden.
""SOUPA"" → S O U P A → positions: S(1), O(2), U(2? wait: S1 O2 U3 P4 A5? But we want A in pos4? In S O U P A: S1 O2 U3 P4 A5 → P4 and A5? Not S1 _ _ A4 _? Here A is at5? So not.

Correct: ""S _ _ A _"" means S then first blank, then second blank, then A, then blank. So at position 4: A.

Examples: ""SHOYA""? No.
""STRIA"" → T is absent, R is absent. Forbidden.

""SPILA""? Not common word.

Another: ""SUDSA"" → S U D S A → duplicate S? S at1 and4? OK, but S at4 allowed? Yes, since TALKS only ruled out S in pos5. But U D: allowed. But word not standard.

Better to use common words.

Place S in position 1 and A in position 5: ""S _ _ _ A""
Pattern: S ?2 ?3 ?4 A

Examples: ""SOFIA"" → O, F, I, A? S1 O2 F3 I4 A5? A at5? Yes. Then O, F, I new.
SOFIA is a place name often accepted.

""SPINA"" → P, I, N → but N absent.

""SWOBA"" → not word.

""SCAMP"" absent letters.

Place A in position 4 and S in position 2? S at2 and A at4? Not in direct conflict.

Word pattern: [not S or A] for pos1, then S for pos2, ..., A for pos4, etc.

But S cannot be at5? We have to have something at5.

Pattern: ?1 S ?3 A ?5

?1 cannot be S? But if it's a different letter.

Example: ""PSYMA"" not word.

Maybe ""OSCUD"" not word.

Too hard.

Let's list all possible allowed letters for new positions: B, D, F, G, H, I, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y.

Try to think of common words with A and S, positions for A in 1,4,5 and S in 1,2,3,4 not conflicting.

Word: ""HAVES"" → H A V E S → but E absent? E and S: positions: A in pos2? Which is ruled out? A must not be in pos2? Yes, from TALKS A marked wrong in pos2. So A can't be in2. HAVES: A at2? No good.

""BASAL"" → B A S A L? A at2 and4? And L absent.

""VISAS"" → V I S A S → S in3 and5? S at5 invalid.

""POSAD"" P O S A D? S at3, A at4? Then D at5? Letters P,O,D allowed. ""POSAD"" is not common; ""POSED"" has E absent.

""USUAL"" → U S U A L → duplicate U, L absent.

Another: ""PHAS"" less than 5.

Perhaps ""BIAS"" 4 letters.

We need to use a word like ""AMISS"" but we can't.

Let's try with A in position 5: words ending with A.

""S"" somewhere not 5.

For example: ""DASHY"" → D A S H Y → A in pos2? Ruled out. And S in pos3? OK? But TALKS didn't rule pos3. Positions: D1 A2 S3 H4 Y5? But A in pos2 is invalid? Yes! A cannot be in pos2 because TALKS had A at pos2 and it was marked wrong position. So dashy is bad.

Another: ""PULAS"" P U L A S → L absent.

""BAGHS"" not word.

""WASHY"" W A S H Y → again A in pos2? No.

Since A is in position 5: "" _ _ _ _ A"" and S in position 1,2,3,4? Avoid position 5 for S.

Example: ""S S S A A"" no.

""MANSA"" M A N S A → A in2 and5? Positions: M1 A2 N3 S4 A5? A at2 is ruled out (since TALKS had A at2 and wrong position) → so A at2 invalid. Also N absent.

""INFRA"" no S.

""OASIS"" O A S I S → A at2 (invalid) and S at4 and5? S at5 invalid.

""QUADS"" Q U A D S → A in pos3? But we have ruled out A in position 3 from CRANE? Yes! A was at pos3 and wrong, so A cannot be at pos3. So A not in2 or3 or soon.

CRANE said pos3 wrong, TALKS said pos2 wrong, so A not in2,3.

In ""QUADS"": U A D S positions: Q1 U2 A3? So A at3? Invalid.

Same issue.

Let's try S in position 1 and A in position 4: "" S ?2 ?3 A ?5 ""

With ?2 and ?3 and ?5 new letters.

Common words: ""SPASM"" S P A S M? But S in1 and4? And A in3? Positions: S1 P2 S A S M? Wait: ""SPASM"" S1 P2 A3 S4 M5? Then A at position3 and S at4 and position5? A in pos3: invalid from CRANE (not in3). And S at5 invalid.

""STOMAS"" too long.

""SHAMUS"" S H A M U S → A at3? Invalid and S at6? No.

Perhaps ""SWAMI"" S W A M I → A in pos3 → invalid.

Not working.

What about A in position 4 and S in position 3: "" _ _ S A _""

Pattern: ?1 ?2 S A ?5

Then ?1 and ?2 and ?5 new letters not absent.

Words: ""D D S A Y"" not.
""BASSY"" B A S S Y → A in2 and S in3? S at3 and4? And A at2 invalid.

""BOSSA"" B O S S A → O, S, S, A → positions: B1 O2 S3 S4 A5? S at4 is not5, so allowed? And A in pos5? Which is allowed because A can be in5. S is at3 and4, so both are not5? Okay. But B1 O2 S3 S4 A5.

But B,O are new, so we can test. ""BOSSA"" is a musical term? Often accepted in word games.

Similarly, ""MASSA"" has M A S S A → A at2 and5? A at2 invalid? So M1 A2? A at2 not allowed.

""FASSA""? Not word.

""PASSA"" not common.

""WASSA"" not.

So ""BOSSA"" seems promising: B O S S A → letters B, O, S, A. S is at3 and4, which are not5, and A at5 not tested before.

But we have duplicate S? We don't know if the word has dupes. From previous, no indication, so if feedback shows S only at one position, it will tell us how many S's.

But to start, perhaps it's okay.

Alternatives: place S in position 1 and A in position 5: "" S ?2 ?3 ?4 A ""

With ?2, ?3, ?4 from allowed.

Words: ""SOFIA"" S O F I A → positions: S1 O2 F3 I4 A5. Perfect. A at5 which is not2 or3. S at1, not5. i.e., A can be in position5? Yes, not ruled out. S at1? TALKS had S at5 and it was wrong, but S at1 is new.

O, F, I are allowed letters.

""SOFIA"" is a valid 5-letter word (capital of Bulgaria, or a female name).

Another: ""SWEDA"" S W E D A → E forbidden? CRANE E x, so absent. Not use E.

""SPIVA"" S P I V A → V is uncommon? But possible.

""SOFIA"" is better known.

""SUDRA"" S U D R A → R absent? R is forbidden? From CRANE: R absent? Yes, CRANE R at2 marked x. So R not allowed.

Therefore, SOFIA works: no absent letters: S O F I A → O, F, I are all new.

So guess ""SOFIA"":

- S in position 1 (test new position)
- A in position 5 (test new position for A)
- Introduces O, F, I

This should clarify the positions of S and A.

<guess>SOFIA</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from both previous guesses:

1. **CRANE**: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x) →  
   - A is in the secret word but not in position 3.  
   - C, R, N, E are absent.  

2. **TALKS**: T(x), A(-), L(x), K(x), S(-) →  
   - A is in the word but not in position 2 (new position ruled out).  
   - S is in the word but not in position 5.  
   - T, L, K are absent.  

**Key insights**:  
- A must be in position 1, 4, or 5 (positions 2 and 3 are ruled out).  
- S must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 (position 5 ruled out).  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, T, L, K (cannot appear in any guess).  
- The secret word must include both A and S.  

For the third guess, the word ""SOFIA"" is chosen because:  
- It places A in position 5 (testing the last untested allowed position for A).  
- It places S in position 1 (testing a new position).  
- It introduces new common letters: O, F, I (all distinct and not ruled out).  
- The format avoids conflicting positions for A and S (S in pos. 1, A in pos. 5) and excludes all absent letters.  

This guess will help clarify the exact positions of A and S while providing feedback on O, F, and I.  

<guess>SOFIA</guess>",SOFIA,"We have two sets of feedback:
1. **CRANE**: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x) → A is in the word but not in position 3.
2. **TALKS**: T(x), A(-), L(x), K(x), S(-) → 
   - A is marked wrong position again. Since it was in position 2 here, it cannot be in position 2 either.
   - S is marked wrong position (so S is in the word but not in position 5).
   - T, L, K are not in the word.

Current knowledge:
- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, T, L, K (cannot be in the word).
- **Present letters with positions ruled out**:
  - A: cannot be in position 3 (from CRANE) and cannot be in position 2 (from TALKS). So it must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
  - S: cannot be in position 5. So S must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Since S is in the word (but not position 5) and A is in the word (but not positions 2 or 3), possible positions:
- A: positions 1, 4, 5
- S: positions 1, 2, 3, 4

Also, note that the word has 5 letters, and we need a word that includes both A and S, and excludes the absent letters.

We must also use only letters that are either A, S, or new letters not yet tested (since we know T, L, K are absent).

List of absent letters: C, R, N, E, T, L, K → 7 letters ruled out.

We have 26 - 7 = 19 letters potentially available, but we should prioritize common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

New guess must:
- Include A (in position 1, 4, or 5)
- Include S (in position 1, 2, 3, or 4, but note positions cannot overlap)
- Avoid using any absent letters: C, R, N, E, T, L, K

Possible word ideas:

- Option 1: Place A in position 1 and S in position 4? Example: A _ _ S _
- Option 2: Place A in position 4 and S in position 1? Example: S _ _ A _
- Option 3: Place A in position 5 and S in position 1? Example: S _ _ _ A

We need to fill the other two blanks with new letters. Let's brainstorm:

For Option 1 (A _ _ S _):
- Words: ABIAS? That has two A's. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Alternatively: ACHAS? But C is not allowed (absent). Or ADIOS? But O and I are allowed? ADIOS: A, D, I, O, S → letters: D, I, O are new.

ADIOS: A in pos1, S in pos5? But S is in pos5? That would be invalid because TALKS had S in pos5 marked wrong, so S cannot be in pos5. Therefore, S must be in pos4? Then if word is A _ _ S _, then S is in pos4. Then the last position is blank. For example: ""AMBOS"" - but it has M, B, O. But S in pos5? No, AMBOS: A M B O S → S is in pos5 → invalid! So we must put S in position 4? Then the word shape: A ?1 ?2 S ?5. Then ?5 must be a letter.

Another idea: ""APSIS"" but S repeated. Or ""AXIS"" - only 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

Alternative: Place A in position 4 and S in position 1? So: S _ _ A _

Words: SOFAS? But O, F, A, S. Positions: S(1), O(2), F(3), A(4), S(5) -> S repeated and position 5 for S is invalid because TALKS S was in pos5 marked wrong. So S cannot be at end.

SOFAS has S at start and end? That would require S to appear twice? But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. However, TALKS S was marked '-' meaning S is in the word but not position 5, but it doesn't say how many S's. So there could be two S's? But we avoid duplicates to get clearer info.

Better to assume no duplicates unless forced? So let's avoid duplicates for now if possible.

Back to positions:
- A must be in 1,4,5
- S must be in 1,2,3,4 but note: position 1 cannot be shared with A unless we have two letters? No, each position is unique.

So to avoid conflict, let's not put both in position 1. We can put S in 1 and A in 4? Or S in 1 and A in 5? Or S in 4 and A in 1? Etc.

Try S in position 1 and A in position 4: word ""S _ _ A _""

Common words: ""SPOAS""? Not standard. ""SHOAS""? Not common.

Perhaps ""SWAGY""? Not a word.

Another: ""SUDAS""? Not word.

Alternatively, place A in position 1 and S in position 4: word ""A _ _ S _""

Examples: ""ABASS"" - not valid. ""ADISS"" - no. ""APHIS"" - 5 letters? A P H I S → positions: A(1), P(2), H(3), I(4)? Wait, if S is in pos5? We need S in pos4? Then word like: ""AMISS"" but S at the end? It's pos5: A M I S S → S in pos4? In AMISS: positions: A(1), M(2), I(3), S(4), S(5). But S(5) is invalid because TALKS S in pos5 was wrong. Also, S repeated.

Alternative: ""AISLE"" → A(1), I(2), S(3), L(4), E(5). But L(4) is L? But L is absent! Because TALKS L was marked x. And E is absent (from CRANE). So cannot use L or E.

We must avoid absent letters: C, R, N, E, T, L, K.

Let's list allowed letters: Alphabet minus absent: A, B, D, F, G, H, I, M, O, P, S, U, V, W, Y, etc. (and S is present, A is present).

Try a word with A in position 4 and S in position 3? But we need to fill others.

Another idea: Place A in position 5? Since it must be in 1,4,5 and we haven't tested 5 or 1.

Consider: S in position 1 and A in position 5: _ _ _ _ A → but we have S first. Word: S _ _ _ A

Examples: ""SOFTA"" -> T and A? T is absent, so no.

""SQUAB"" -> Q,U,A,B → but A is in position 5? Positions: S(1), Q(2), U(3), A(4)? Wait, A is in position 4? But we put A in position 5? In SQUAB: A is in position5? SQUAB: S Q U A B → A at position 4? Actually: S(1), Q(2), U(3), A(4), B(5). So A at 4 → valid? We want A at 5? But it's at 4? We can have A at 4? Positions for A: 1,4,5 are all possible.

But SQUAB: Q is rare? And U, B. Also, S at 1 is tested? But in TALKS, S was at 5 and marked wrong position, which tells us S is present but not 5. Doesn't say about other positions.

S in position 1 might be okay? But we can test it.

Better word: ""SWOYA""? Not valid.

Maybe ""SHIVA"" -> S H I V A → positions: S(1), H(2), I(3), V(4), A(5). This has A in position 5 (not tested before) and S in position 1 (new position). Letters: H, I, V are new.

But is SHIVA a common word? In word games, it is often accepted.

Another: ""SKIMP"" but K is absent.

Avoid K.

Let's think of words with S and A that fit the constraints.

Perhaps: ""PIOUS"" but no A? Must include A.

""AUDIO"" → A U D I O → A(1), then U(2), D(3), I(4), O(5). But S is not included? We must include S because we know it's in the word? Yes! From TALKS feedback, S is present and must be included.

So the word must have both A and S.

Ignored that earlier? Yes! Because we know S is in the word (marked '-' in TALKS position 5).

So the guess must include A and S.

Thus, we need a word containing A and S, with positions:
- A not in 2 or 3 → positions 1,4,5
- S not in 5 → positions 1,2,3,4

And exclude C,R,N,E,T,L,K.

Possible configurations:

Case 1: A in position 1, S in position 2,3, or 4? Avoid S in 1 since it would conflict? No, if A is at 1, S cannot be at 1. So S at 2,3, or 4.

Example: A in pos1, S in pos2: ""A S _ _ _""
- Words: ""ASSAY"" → two S and Y? Positions: A(1), S(2), S(3), A(4)? No, ASSAY: A S S A Y → S in 2 and 3? But we don't know duplicates. And A at1 and4? Might be confusing. Avoid duplicates? Better: ""ASKED"" but K and E absent.

No good.

A in pos1, S in pos3: ""A _ S _ _""
- Words: ""AISLE"" → A(1), I(2), S(3), L(4), E(5) → but L and E absent → invalid.

""AMUSE""→ A(1), M(2), U(3), S(4), E(5) → E absent? E forbidden (CRANE x). So no.

""APHIS"" → A(1), P(2), H(3), I(4), S(5)? But S(5) is invalid because TALKS showed S cannot be at5. So no. We need S not at5? So in ""A _ S _ _"", if S is pos3, then the last two positions must not be S? But we need to avoid S at5.

In this case, S at3 is allowed? TALKS said S not at5, not about pos3.

But in word like ""APHIS"" it would have S at5? Which is bad. So we need a word for positions: A(1), then S in pos3, and the last two non-S? Example: ""ADZES"" → A(1), D(2), Z(3), E(4), S(5) → S@5 invalid and E absent. 

Case: A in pos1, S in pos4: ""A _ _ S _""
Then the word has pattern ""A ?1 ?2 S ?5""
We must fill ?1, ?2, ?5 with allowed letters excluding C,R,N,E,T,L,K.
Also, ?5 cannot be S? OK.

?1 and ?2: new letters.
Possible words: ""ABYSS"" → duplicate S and S at5? No: A B Y S S → S at4 and5 → S@5 invalid.
""ADOSS"" → D, O → S at4 and5? No.
""No? What about ""APESH""? Not a word.

Another: ""AMASS"" → A M A S S → duplicate A and S, and S@5? Invalid.

""AVOID"" → no S.

Hard to find. Try other positions.

Alternative: Place S in position 1, and A in position 4: ""S _ _ A _""
Then pattern: S ?2 ?3 A ?5
- ?5 must not be S (if there's only one S? But could be repeated? Avoid to be safe).
- ?2 and ?3: new letters.

Words: ""SPICA"" → S P I C A → C absent. Forbidden.
""SOUPA"" → S O U P A → positions: S(1), O(2), U(2? wait: S1 O2 U3 P4 A5? But we want A in pos4? In S O U P A: S1 O2 U3 P4 A5 → P4 and A5? Not S1 _ _ A4 _? Here A is at5? So not.

Correct: ""S _ _ A _"" means S then first blank, then second blank, then A, then blank. So at position 4: A.

Examples: ""SHOYA""? No.
""STRIA"" → T is absent, R is absent. Forbidden.

""SPILA""? Not common word.

Another: ""SUDSA"" → S U D S A → duplicate S? S at1 and4? OK, but S at4 allowed? Yes, since TALKS only ruled out S in pos5. But U D: allowed. But word not standard.

Better to use common words.

Place S in position 1 and A in position 5: ""S _ _ _ A""
Pattern: S ?2 ?3 ?4 A

Examples: ""SOFIA"" → O, F, I, A? S1 O2 F3 I4 A5? A at5? Yes. Then O, F, I new.
SOFIA is a place name often accepted.

""SPINA"" → P, I, N → but N absent.

""SWOBA"" → not word.

""SCAMP"" absent letters.

Place A in position 4 and S in position 2? S at2 and A at4? Not in direct conflict.

Word pattern: [not S or A] for pos1, then S for pos2, ..., A for pos4, etc.

But S cannot be at5? We have to have something at5.

Pattern: ?1 S ?3 A ?5

?1 cannot be S? But if it's a different letter.

Example: ""PSYMA"" not word.

Maybe ""OSCUD"" not word.

Too hard.

Let's list all possible allowed letters for new positions: B, D, F, G, H, I, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y.

Try to think of common words with A and S, positions for A in 1,4,5 and S in 1,2,3,4 not conflicting.

Word: ""HAVES"" → H A V E S → but E absent? E and S: positions: A in pos2? Which is ruled out? A must not be in pos2? Yes, from TALKS A marked wrong in pos2. So A can't be in2. HAVES: A at2? No good.

""BASAL"" → B A S A L? A at2 and4? And L absent.

""VISAS"" → V I S A S → S in3 and5? S at5 invalid.

""POSAD"" P O S A D? S at3, A at4? Then D at5? Letters P,O,D allowed. ""POSAD"" is not common; ""POSED"" has E absent.

""USUAL"" → U S U A L → duplicate U, L absent.

Another: ""PHAS"" less than 5.

Perhaps ""BIAS"" 4 letters.

We need to use a word like ""AMISS"" but we can't.

Let's try with A in position 5: words ending with A.

""S"" somewhere not 5.

For example: ""DASHY"" → D A S H Y → A in pos2? Ruled out. And S in pos3? OK? But TALKS didn't rule pos3. Positions: D1 A2 S3 H4 Y5? But A in pos2 is invalid? Yes! A cannot be in pos2 because TALKS had A at pos2 and it was marked wrong position. So dashy is bad.

Another: ""PULAS"" P U L A S → L absent.

""BAGHS"" not word.

""WASHY"" W A S H Y → again A in pos2? No.

Since A is in position 5: "" _ _ _ _ A"" and S in position 1,2,3,4? Avoid position 5 for S.

Example: ""S S S A A"" no.

""MANSA"" M A N S A → A in2 and5? Positions: M1 A2 N3 S4 A5? A at2 is ruled out (since TALKS had A at2 and wrong position) → so A at2 invalid. Also N absent.

""INFRA"" no S.

""OASIS"" O A S I S → A at2 (invalid) and S at4 and5? S at5 invalid.

""QUADS"" Q U A D S → A in pos3? But we have ruled out A in position 3 from CRANE? Yes! A was at pos3 and wrong, so A cannot be at pos3. So A not in2 or3 or soon.

CRANE said pos3 wrong, TALKS said pos2 wrong, so A not in2,3.

In ""QUADS"": U A D S positions: Q1 U2 A3? So A at3? Invalid.

Same issue.

Let's try S in position 1 and A in position 4: "" S ?2 ?3 A ?5 ""

With ?2 and ?3 and ?5 new letters.

Common words: ""SPASM"" S P A S M? But S in1 and4? And A in3? Positions: S1 P2 S A S M? Wait: ""SPASM"" S1 P2 A3 S4 M5? Then A at position3 and S at4 and position5? A in pos3: invalid from CRANE (not in3). And S at5 invalid.

""STOMAS"" too long.

""SHAMUS"" S H A M U S → A at3? Invalid and S at6? No.

Perhaps ""SWAMI"" S W A M I → A in pos3 → invalid.

Not working.

What about A in position 4 and S in position 3: "" _ _ S A _""

Pattern: ?1 ?2 S A ?5

Then ?1 and ?2 and ?5 new letters not absent.

Words: ""D D S A Y"" not.
""BASSY"" B A S S Y → A in2 and S in3? S at3 and4? And A at2 invalid.

""BOSSA"" B O S S A → O, S, S, A → positions: B1 O2 S3 S4 A5? S at4 is not5, so allowed? And A in pos5? Which is allowed because A can be in5. S is at3 and4, so both are not5? Okay. But B1 O2 S3 S4 A5.

But B,O are new, so we can test. ""BOSSA"" is a musical term? Often accepted in word games.

Similarly, ""MASSA"" has M A S S A → A at2 and5? A at2 invalid? So M1 A2? A at2 not allowed.

""FASSA""? Not word.

""PASSA"" not common.

""WASSA"" not.

So ""BOSSA"" seems promising: B O S S A → letters B, O, S, A. S is at3 and4, which are not5, and A at5 not tested before.

But we have duplicate S? We don't know if the word has dupes. From previous, no indication, so if feedback shows S only at one position, it will tell us how many S's.

But to start, perhaps it's okay.

Alternatives: place S in position 1 and A in position 5: "" S ?2 ?3 ?4 A ""

With ?2, ?3, ?4 from allowed.

Words: ""SOFIA"" S O F I A → positions: S1 O2 F3 I4 A5. Perfect. A at5 which is not2 or3. S at1, not5. i.e., A can be in position5? Yes, not ruled out. S at1? TALKS had S at5 and it was wrong, but S at1 is new.

O, F, I are allowed letters.

""SOFIA"" is a valid 5-letter word (capital of Bulgaria, or a female name).

Another: ""SWEDA"" S W E D A → E forbidden? CRANE E x, so absent. Not use E.

""SPIVA"" S P I V A → V is uncommon? But possible.

""SOFIA"" is better known.

""SUDRA"" S U D R A → R absent? R is forbidden? From CRANE: R absent? Yes, CRANE R at2 marked x. So R not allowed.

Therefore, SOFIA works: no absent letters: S O F I A → O, F, I are all new.

So guess ""SOFIA"":

- S in position 1 (test new position)
- A in position 5 (test new position for A)
- Introduces O, F, I

This should clarify the positions of S and A.

<guess>SOFIA</guess>Based on the feedback from both previous guesses:

1. **CRANE**: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x) →  
   - A is in the secret word but not in position 3.  
   - C, R, N, E are absent.  

2. **TALKS**: T(x), A(-), L(x), K(x), S(-) →  
   - A is in the word but not in position 2 (new position ruled out).  
   - S is in the word but not in position 5.  
   - T, L, K are absent.  

**Key insights**:  
- A must be in position 1, 4, or 5 (positions 2 and 3 are ruled out).  
- S must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 (position 5 ruled out).  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, T, L, K (cannot appear in any guess).  
- The secret word must include both A and S.  

For the third guess, the word ""SOFIA"" is chosen because:  
- It places A in position 5 (testing the last untested allowed position for A).  
- It places S in position 1 (testing a new position).  
- It introduces new common letters: O, F, I (all distinct and not ruled out).  
- The format avoids conflicting positions for A and S (S in pos. 1, A in pos. 5) and excludes all absent letters.  

This guess will help clarify the exact positions of A and S while providing feedback on O, F, and I.",Guess 4: SOFIA -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) O(x) F(x) I(-) A(✓),FAIL

Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.

I'll choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes both common vowels and consonants.
One example of a good starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E: which are common and includes vowels (A, E) and consonants (C, R, N).

Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also a popular starting word because it includes S, L, A, T, E.

But note: the example in the rules started with ""STORM"" and then ""BRAVE"", but I want an optimal start.

Let me pick ""CRANE"":

C: common consonant
R: common consonant
A: common vowel
N: common consonant
E: common vowel

So my first guess will be ""CRANE"".

But note: the problem says to respond in the format: <guess>CRANE</guess>For the first guess, I aim to maximize information by using a word with common letters and minimal repetitions. The word ""CRANE"" is ideal because:
- It contains common vowels (A, E) and consonants (C, R, N)
- All letters are distinct, covering 5 different possibilities
- It balances high-frequency letters that appear in many English words, helping narrow down future guesses efficiently.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word (all marked 'x').
- A is in the secret word but in the wrong position (marked '-'). Since it was in position 3 in ""CRANE"", it cannot be in position 3 in the secret word.

For the second guess:
- Must include 'A' in a position other than 3 (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).
- Exclude the absent letters: C, R, N, E.
- Use new, common letters to maximize information gain (e.g., S, T, L, K).

The word ""TALKS"" is chosen because:
- It includes 'A' in position 2 (testing a new position).
- It introduces new common letters: T, L, K, S (all distinct).
- It avoids using known absent letters.

This guess should help identify which of these new letters are in the word and provide more positional information.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: and then the word.

So, my second guess: TALKS.

But let's double-check: 
- First guess CR: CRANE -> A is wrong position (position 3) -> so not in 3.
- TALKS: T at 1, A at 2, L at 3, K at 4, S at 5.

We are testing A in position 2 and also testing T, L, K, S.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word (all marked 'x').
- A is in the secret word but in the wrong position (marked '-'). Since it was in position 3 in ""CRANE"", it cannot be in position 3 in the secret word.

For the second guess:
- Must include 'A' in a position other than 3 (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).
- Exclude the absent letters: C, R, N, E.
- Use new, common letters to maximize information gain (e.g., S, T, L, K).

The word ""TALKS"" is chosen because:
- It includes 'A' in position 2 (testing a new position).
- It introduces new common letters: T, L, K, S (all distinct).
- It avoids using known absent letters.

This guess should help identify which of these new letters are in the word and provide more positional information.

<guess>TALKS -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
<｜Assistant｜>We are given previous feedback:
Guess 1: CRANE -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)

This tells us:
- A is in the secret word but not in position 3 (since it was in position 3 of CRANE and marked as wrong position).
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

For the second guess, we need to:
1. Include A (because we know it's in the word) but not in position 3.
2. Avoid using C, R, N, E.
3. Choose a word with letters that are common in 5-letter words to gain more information.

Considering words that include A and positions to try A:
- A can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since position 3 is eliminated).
- We also want to cover other common letters. Letters like S, T, L, I, O, U, etc., are good choices because they appear frequently.

Possible words:
- Trying A in position 2: words like SALTY, SAULT, etc. But we have limited knowledge of what's available.
- We need a word that uses new letters to maximize information.

A good candidate is ""TALKS"":
- T in position 1
- A in position 2 (new position for A)
- L in position 3
- K in position 4
- S in position 5

This word uses A in a different position and introduces T, L, K, S – all common letters not ruled out.

Alternative: ""PLAIT"" but it has I and T, and A in position 3? Wait, no: PLAIT would have A in position 3? Let's check:
P-L-A-I-T -> position 3: A? But we cannot put A in position 3. So no.

Or ""STALK""? But S and T are new, A in position 3? No, because A cannot be in position 3. ""STALK"" has A in position 3? Yes: S-T-A-L-K -> position 3 is A. So invalid for A position.

Therefore, ""TALKS"" is valid with A in position 2.

Another candidate: ""PASTA"" but it has P and S, but also two A's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed. Since we haven't ruled out duplicates, but the feedback hasn't indicated any duplicate issues. But we want distinct letters to maximize information. ""PASTA"" has duplicate A? P-A-S-T-A -> two A's. It might cause confusion if the word has only one A. Better to avoid duplicates.

""TALKS"" has all distinct letters: T, A, L, K, S.

So we choose ""TALKS"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":

- **C, R, N, E**: Not in the word at all (marked 'x').
- **A**: Present in the word but not in position 3 (marked '-').

For the second guess, we need to:
1. **Include A** in a position other than 3 (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).
2. **Exclude C, R, N, E** entirely.
3. Use **new, common letters** to maximize information gain.

The word **""TALKS""** is chosen because:
- It places A in position 2 (testing a new position).
- It introduces **T, L, K, S** (common letters not previously tested).
- All letters are distinct, avoiding redundancy for clearer feedback.

This guess will help identify:
- If T, L, K, or S are in the secret word.
- If A is correctly positioned at index 2.
- Further positional information about A if the feedback returns '-' again.

But let's double-check: 
- First guess CR: CRANE -> A is wrong position (position 3) -> so not in 3.

<guess>TALKS -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
Guess 3: TALKS -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(-) L(x) K(x) S(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two sets of feedback:
1. **CRANE**: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x) → A is in the word but not in position 3.
2. **TALKS**: T(x), A(-), L(x), K(x), S(-) → 
   - A is marked wrong position again. Since it was in position 2 here, it cannot be in position 2 either.
   - S is marked wrong position (so S is in the word but not in position 5).
   - T, L, K are not in the word.

Current knowledge:
- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, T, L, K (cannot be in the word).
- **Present letters with positions ruled out**:
  - A: cannot be in position 3 (from CRANE) and cannot be in position 2 (from TALKS). So it must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
  - S: cannot be in position 5. So S must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Since S is in the word (but not position 5) and A is in the word (but not positions 2 or 3), possible positions:
- A: positions 1, 4, 5
- S: positions 1, 2, 3, 4

Also, note that the word has 5 letters, and we need a word that includes both A and S, and excludes the absent letters.

We must also use only letters that are either A, S, or new letters not yet tested (since we know T, L, K are absent).

List of absent letters: C, R, N, E, T, L, K → 7 letters ruled out.

We have 26 - 7 = 19 letters potentially available, but we should prioritize common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

New guess must:
- Include A (in position 1, 4, or 5)
- Include S (in position 1, 2, 3, or 4, but note positions cannot overlap)
- Avoid using any absent letters: C, R, N, E, T, L, K

Possible word ideas:

- Option 1: Place A in position 1 and S in position 4? Example: A _ _ S _
- Option 2: Place A in position 4 and S in position 1? Example: S _ _ A _
- Option 3: Place A in position 5 and S in position 1? Example: S _ _ _ A

We need to fill the other two blanks with new letters. Let's brainstorm:

For Option 1 (A _ _ S _):
- Words: ABIAS? That has two A's. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Alternatively: ACHAS? But C is not allowed (absent). Or ADIOS? But O and I are allowed? ADIOS: A, D, I, O, S → letters: D, I, O are new.

ADIOS: A in pos1, S in pos5? But S is in pos5? That would be invalid because TALKS had S in pos5 marked wrong, so S cannot be in pos5. Therefore, S must be in pos4? Then if word is A _ _ S _, then S is in pos4. Then the last position is blank. For example: ""AMBOS"" - but it has M, B, O. But S in pos5? No, AMBOS: A M B O S → S is in pos5 → invalid! So we must put S in position 4? Then the word shape: A ?1 ?2 S ?5. Then ?5 must be a letter.

Another idea: ""APSIS"" but S repeated. Or ""AXIS"" - only 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

Alternative: Place A in position 4 and S in position 1? So: S _ _ A _

Words: SOFAS? But O, F, A, S. Positions: S(1), O(2), F(3), A(4), S(5) -> S repeated and position 5 for S is invalid because TALKS S was in pos5 marked wrong. So S cannot be at end.

SOFAS has S at start and end? That would require S to appear twice? But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. However, TALKS S was marked '-' meaning S is in the word but not position 5, but it doesn't say how many S's. So there could be two S's? But we avoid duplicates to get clearer info.

Better to assume no duplicates unless forced? So let's avoid duplicates for now if possible.

Back to positions:
- A must be in 1,4,5
- S must be in 1,2,3,4 but note: position 1 cannot be shared with A unless we have two letters? No, each position is unique.

So to avoid conflict, let's not put both in position 1. We can put S in 1 and A in 4? Or S in 1 and A in 5? Or S in 4 and A in 1? Etc.

Try S in position 1 and A in position 4: word ""S _ _ A _""

Common words: ""SPOAS""? Not standard. ""SHOAS""? Not common.

Perhaps ""SWAGY""? Not a word.

Another: ""SUDAS""? Not word.

Alternatively, place A in position 1 and S in position 4: word ""A _ _ S _""

Examples: ""ABASS"" - not valid. ""ADISS"" - no. ""APHIS"" - 5 letters? A P H I S → positions: A(1), P(2), H(3), I(4)? Wait, if S is in pos5? We need S in pos4? Then word like: ""AMISS"" but S at the end? It's pos5: A M I S S → S in pos4? In AMISS: positions: A(1), M(2), I(3), S(4), S(5). But S(5) is invalid because TALKS S in pos5 was wrong. Also, S repeated.

Alternative: ""AISLE"" → A(1), I(2), S(3), L(4), E(5). But L(4) is L? But L is absent! Because TALKS L was marked x. And E is absent (from CRANE). So cannot use L or E.

We must avoid absent letters: C, R, N, E, T, L, K.

Let's list allowed letters: Alphabet minus absent: A, B, D, F, G, H, I, M, O, P, S, U, V, W, Y, etc. (and S is present, A is present).

Try a word with A in position 4 and S in position 3? But we need to fill others.

Another idea: Place A in position 5? Since it must be in 1,4,5 and we haven't tested 5 or 1.

Consider: S in position 1 and A in position 5: _ _ _ _ A → but we have S first. Word: S _ _ _ A

Examples: ""SOFTA"" -> T and A? T is absent, so no.

""SQUAB"" -> Q,U,A,B → but A is in position 5? Positions: S(1), Q(2), U(3), A(4)? Wait, A is in position 4? But we put A in position 5? In SQUAB: A is in position5? SQUAB: S Q U A B → A at position 4? Actually: S(1), Q(2), U(3), A(4), B(5). So A at 4 → valid? We want A at 5? But it's at 4? We can have A at 4? Positions for A: 1,4,5 are all possible.

But SQUAB: Q is rare? And U, B. Also, S at 1 is tested? But in TALKS, S was at 5 and marked wrong position, which tells us S is present but not 5. Doesn't say about other positions.

S in position 1 might be okay? But we can test it.

Better word: ""SWOYA""? Not valid.

Maybe ""SHIVA"" -> S H I V A → positions: S(1), H(2), I(3), V(4), A(5). This has A in position 5 (not tested before) and S in position 1 (new position). Letters: H, I, V are new.

But is SHIVA a common word? In word games, it is often accepted.

Another: ""SKIMP"" but K is absent.

Avoid K.

Let's think of words with S and A that fit the constraints.

Perhaps: ""PIOUS"" but no A? Must include A.

""AUDIO"" → A U D I O → A(1), then U(2), D(3), I(4), O(5). But S is not included? We must include S because we know it's in the word? Yes! From TALKS feedback, S is present and must be included.

So the word must have both A and S.

Ignored that earlier? Yes! Because we know S is in the word (marked '-' in TALKS position 5).

So the guess must include A and S.

Thus, we need a word containing A and S, with positions:
- A not in 2 or 3 → positions 1,4,5
- S not in 5 → positions 1,2,3,4

And exclude C,R,N,E,T,L,K.

Possible configurations:

Case 1: A in position 1, S in position 2,3, or 4? Avoid S in 1 since it would conflict? No, if A is at 1, S cannot be at 1. So S at 2,3, or 4.

Example: A in pos1, S in pos2: ""A S _ _ _""
- Words: ""ASSAY"" → two S and Y? Positions: A(1), S(2), S(3), A(4)? No, ASSAY: A S S A Y → S in 2 and 3? But we don't know duplicates. And A at1 and4? Might be confusing. Avoid duplicates? Better: ""ASKED"" but K and E absent.

No good.

A in pos1, S in pos3: ""A _ S _ _""
- Words: ""AISLE"" → A(1), I(2), S(3), L(4), E(5) → but L and E absent → invalid.

""AMUSE""→ A(1), M(2), U(3), S(4), E(5) → E absent? E forbidden (CRANE x). So no.

""APHIS"" → A(1), P(2), H(3), I(4), S(5)? But S(5) is invalid because TALKS showed S cannot be at5. So no. We need S not at5? So in ""A _ S _ _"", if S is pos3, then the last two positions must not be S? But we need to avoid S at5.

In this case, S at3 is allowed? TALKS said S not at5, not about pos3.

But in word like ""APHIS"" it would have S at5? Which is bad. So we need a word for positions: A(1), then S in pos3, and the last two non-S? Example: ""ADZES"" → A(1), D(2), Z(3), E(4), S(5) → S@5 invalid and E absent. 

Case: A in pos1, S in pos4: ""A _ _ S _""
Then the word has pattern ""A ?1 ?2 S ?5""
We must fill ?1, ?2, ?5 with allowed letters excluding C,R,N,E,T,L,K.
Also, ?5 cannot be S? OK.

?1 and ?2: new letters.
Possible words: ""ABYSS"" → duplicate S and S at5? No: A B Y S S → S at4 and5 → S@5 invalid.
""ADOSS"" → D, O → S at4 and5? No.
""No? What about ""APESH""? Not a word.

Another: ""AMASS"" → A M A S S → duplicate A and S, and S@5? Invalid.

""AVOID"" → no S.

Hard to find. Try other positions.

Alternative: Place S in position 1, and A in position 4: ""S _ _ A _""
Then pattern: S ?2 ?3 A ?5
- ?5 must not be S (if there's only one S? But could be repeated? Avoid to be safe).
- ?2 and ?3: new letters.

Words: ""SPICA"" → S P I C A → C absent. Forbidden.
""SOUPA"" → S O U P A → positions: S(1), O(2), U(2? wait: S1 O2 U3 P4 A5? But we want A in pos4? In S O U P A: S1 O2 U3 P4 A5 → P4 and A5? Not S1 _ _ A4 _? Here A is at5? So not.

Correct: ""S _ _ A _"" means S then first blank, then second blank, then A, then blank. So at position 4: A.

Examples: ""SHOYA""? No.
""STRIA"" → T is absent, R is absent. Forbidden.

""SPILA""? Not common word.

Another: ""SUDSA"" → S U D S A → duplicate S? S at1 and4? OK, but S at4 allowed? Yes, since TALKS only ruled out S in pos5. But U D: allowed. But word not standard.

Better to use common words.

Place S in position 1 and A in position 5: ""S _ _ _ A""
Pattern: S ?2 ?3 ?4 A

Examples: ""SOFIA"" → O, F, I, A? S1 O2 F3 I4 A5? A at5? Yes. Then O, F, I new.
SOFIA is a place name often accepted.

""SPINA"" → P, I, N → but N absent.

""SWOBA"" → not word.

""SCAMP"" absent letters.

Place A in position 4 and S in position 2? S at2 and A at4? Not in direct conflict.

Word pattern: [not S or A] for pos1, then S for pos2, ..., A for pos4, etc.

But S cannot be at5? We have to have something at5.

Pattern: ?1 S ?3 A ?5

?1 cannot be S? But if it's a different letter.

Example: ""PSYMA"" not word.

Maybe ""OSCUD"" not word.

Too hard.

Let's list all possible allowed letters for new positions: B, D, F, G, H, I, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y.

Try to think of common words with A and S, positions for A in 1,4,5 and S in 1,2,3,4 not conflicting.

Word: ""HAVES"" → H A V E S → but E absent? E and S: positions: A in pos2? Which is ruled out? A must not be in pos2? Yes, from TALKS A marked wrong in pos2. So A can't be in2. HAVES: A at2? No good.

""BASAL"" → B A S A L? A at2 and4? And L absent.

""VISAS"" → V I S A S → S in3 and5? S at5 invalid.

""POSAD"" P O S A D? S at3, A at4? Then D at5? Letters P,O,D allowed. ""POSAD"" is not common; ""POSED"" has E absent.

""USUAL"" → U S U A L → duplicate U, L absent.

Another: ""PHAS"" less than 5.

Perhaps ""BIAS"" 4 letters.

We need to use a word like ""AMISS"" but we can't.

Let's try with A in position 5: words ending with A.

""S"" somewhere not 5.

For example: ""DASHY"" → D A S H Y → A in pos2? Ruled out. And S in pos3? OK? But TALKS didn't rule pos3. Positions: D1 A2 S3 H4 Y5? But A in pos2 is invalid? Yes! A cannot be in pos2 because TALKS had A at pos2 and it was marked wrong position. So dashy is bad.

Another: ""PULAS"" P U L A S → L absent.

""BAGHS"" not word.

""WASHY"" W A S H Y → again A in pos2? No.

Since A is in position 5: "" _ _ _ _ A"" and S in position 1,2,3,4? Avoid position 5 for S.

Example: ""S S S A A"" no.

""MANSA"" M A N S A → A in2 and5? Positions: M1 A2 N3 S4 A5? A at2 is ruled out (since TALKS had A at2 and wrong position) → so A at2 invalid. Also N absent.

""INFRA"" no S.

""OASIS"" O A S I S → A at2 (invalid) and S at4 and5? S at5 invalid.

""QUADS"" Q U A D S → A in pos3? But we have ruled out A in position 3 from CRANE? Yes! A was at pos3 and wrong, so A cannot be at pos3. So A not in2 or3 or soon.

CRANE said pos3 wrong, TALKS said pos2 wrong, so A not in2,3.

In ""QUADS"": U A D S positions: Q1 U2 A3? So A at3? Invalid.

Same issue.

Let's try S in position 1 and A in position 4: "" S ?2 ?3 A ?5 ""

With ?2 and ?3 and ?5 new letters.

Common words: ""SPASM"" S P A S M? But S in1 and4? And A in3? Positions: S1 P2 S A S M? Wait: ""SPASM"" S1 P2 A3 S4 M5? Then A at position3 and S at4 and position5? A in pos3: invalid from CRANE (not in3). And S at5 invalid.

""STOMAS"" too long.

""SHAMUS"" S H A M U S → A at3? Invalid and S at6? No.

Perhaps ""SWAMI"" S W A M I → A in pos3 → invalid.

Not working.

What about A in position 4 and S in position 3: "" _ _ S A _""

Pattern: ?1 ?2 S A ?5

Then ?1 and ?2 and ?5 new letters not absent.

Words: ""D D S A Y"" not.
""BASSY"" B A S S Y → A in2 and S in3? S at3 and4? And A at2 invalid.

""BOSSA"" B O S S A → O, S, S, A → positions: B1 O2 S3 S4 A5? S at4 is not5, so allowed? And A in pos5? Which is allowed because A can be in5. S is at3 and4, so both are not5? Okay. But B1 O2 S3 S4 A5.

But B,O are new, so we can test. ""BOSSA"" is a musical term? Often accepted in word games.

Similarly, ""MASSA"" has M A S S A → A at2 and5? A at2 invalid? So M1 A2? A at2 not allowed.

""FASSA""? Not word.

""PASSA"" not common.

""WASSA"" not.

So ""BOSSA"" seems promising: B O S S A → letters B, O, S, A. S is at3 and4, which are not5, and A at5 not tested before.

But we have duplicate S? We don't know if the word has dupes. From previous, no indication, so if feedback shows S only at one position, it will tell us how many S's.

But to start, perhaps it's okay.

Alternatives: place S in position 1 and A in position 5: "" S ?2 ?3 ?4 A ""

With ?2, ?3, ?4 from allowed.

Words: ""SOFIA"" S O F I A → positions: S1 O2 F3 I4 A5. Perfect. A at5 which is not2 or3. S at1, not5. i.e., A can be in position5? Yes, not ruled out. S at1? TALKS had S at5 and it was wrong, but S at1 is new.

O, F, I are allowed letters.

""SOFIA"" is a valid 5-letter word (capital of Bulgaria, or a female name).

Another: ""SWEDA"" S W E D A → E forbidden? CRANE E x, so absent. Not use E.

""SPIVA"" S P I V A → V is uncommon? But possible.

""SOFIA"" is better known.

""SUDRA"" S U D R A → R absent? R is forbidden? From CRANE: R absent? Yes, CRANE R at2 marked x. So R not allowed.

Therefore, SOFIA works: no absent letters: S O F I A → O, F, I are all new.

So guess ""SOFIA"":

- S in position 1 (test new position)
- A in position 5 (test new position for A)
- Introduces O, F, I

This should clarify the positions of S and A.

<guess>SOFIA</guess>Based on the feedback from both previous guesses:

1. **CRANE**: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x) →  
   - A is in the secret word but not in position 3.  
   - C, R, N, E are absent.  

2. **TALKS**: T(x), A(-), L(x), K(x), S(-) →  
   - A is in the word but not in position 2 (new position ruled out).  
   - S is in the word but not in position 5.  
   - T, L, K are absent.  

**Key insights**:  
- A must be in position 1, 4, or 5 (positions 2 and 3 are ruled out).  
- S must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 (position 5 ruled out).  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, T, L, K (cannot appear in any guess).  
- The secret word must include both A and S.  

For the third guess, the word ""SOFIA"" is chosen because:  
- It places A in position 5 (testing the last untested allowed position for A).  
- It places S in position 1 (testing a new position).  
- It introduces new common letters: O, F, I (all distinct and not ruled out).  
- The format avoids conflicting positions for A and S (S in pos. 1, A in pos. 5) and excludes all absent letters.  

This guess will help clarify the exact positions of A and S while providing feedback on O, F, and I.

Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: and then the word.

So, my second guess: TALKS.

But let's double-check: 
- First guess CR: CRANE -> A is wrong position (position 3) -> so not in 3.
- TALKS: T at 1, A at 2, L at 3, K at 4, S at 5.

We are testing A in position 2 and also testing T, L, K, S.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word (all marked 'x').
- A is in the secret word but in the wrong position (marked '-'). Since it was in position 3 in ""CRANE"", it cannot be in position 3 in the secret word.

For the second guess:
- Must include 'A' in a position other than 3 (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).
- Exclude the absent letters: C, R, N, E.
- Use new, common letters to maximize information gain (e.g., S, T, L, K).

The word ""TALKS"" is chosen because:
- It includes 'A' in position 2 (testing a new position).
- It introduces new common letters: T, L, K, S (all distinct).
- It avoids using known absent letters.

This guess should help identify which of these new letters are in the word and provide more positional information.

<guess>TALKS -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
Guess 3: TALKS -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(-) L(x) K(x) S(-)
Guess 4: SOFIA -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) O(x) F(x) I(-) A(✓)

The word ""CRANE"" is ideal because:\n- It contains common vowels (A, E) and consonants (C, R, N)\n- All letters are distinct, covering 5 different possibilities\n- It balances high-frequency letters that appear in many English words, helping narrow down future guesses efficiently.\n\n<guess>CRANE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nSo the secret word contains \'A\', but not in the third position. And the letters C, R, N, E are absent.\n\nFor our next guess:\n- We must include \'A\' since it is in the word, but not in position 3.\n- We should avoid using C, R, N, E because they are not in the word.\n- We want to test other common letters to gain more information.\n\nLet me think of a new 5-letter word that:\n1. Includes \'A\' in a position that is not 3 (since position 3 was wrong). Possible positions for \'A\': 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n2. Does not include C, R, N, E.\n3. Uses other common letters such as S, T, L, I, O, D, M, G, B, etc.\n\nWe also want to cover as many new letters as possible.\n\nCommon letters not yet tested: S, T, L, I, O, D, G, B, H, K, M, P, etc.\n\nConsidering the feedback, let\'s try to put \'A\' in a different position.\n\nPossible words: \n- Starting with S: SAULT? But we don\'t know if U and L are good. We need valid words.\n\nLet me list some candidate words:\n\nOption: ""SALAD"" - but \'A\' is in position 2 and 4. However, we have duplicate letters? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. The rules didn\'t prohibit duplicates, but the feedback example didn\'t have duplicates. We should be cautious.\n\nBut the feedback symbols are per letter. If there are duplicate letters and the secret word has two of the same, then feedback might reflect that. However, in our case, we know only one \'A\' is confirmed so far? Actually, we don\'t know. We only know at least one \'A\' is present.\n\nTo avoid complexity, perhaps we should start with a word without duplicates.\n\nOption: ""PASTA"" - but has \'A\' at position 2 and 5? Also we haven\'t tested P, S, T.\n\nBut let\'s see: ""PASTA"" has P, A, S, T, A. But we are avoiding duplicates? We can use it, but we might get less information.\n\nSince we have limited tries, let\'s choose a word with distinct letters.\n\nPossible words containing \'A\' and excluding C, R, N, E, using common letters.\n\nCommon consonants: S, T, L, M, etc.\n\nIdea: include S and T since they are very common.\n\nWord: ""SLATE"" - but we have E? We know E is not in the word because it got an \'x\'. So cannot use E.\n\nTherefore, avoid E.\n\nWord: ""TALKS"" - letters: T, A, L, K, S. All distinct and new.\n\nBut we can also consider other words.\n\nAnother option: ""BASIL"" - B, A, S, I, L.\n\nBoth seem reasonable.\n\nWe also want to try to place \'A\' in a position different from 3. In ""TALKS"":\n- A is in position 2 (if we consider positions: 1:T, 2:A, 3:L, 4:K, 5:S)\n\nIn the feedback, for ""CRANE"", A was in position 3 and it was wrong. So now we are trying position 2.\n\nSimilarly, ""BASIL"": A in position 2.\n\nWe could try position 1: e.g., ""ADIOS"" - but that has D, I, O, S and A at 1. But we don\'t know about D, I, O.\n\nBut ""ADIOS"" might be less common? Also, we have S and O.\n\nAnyway, both ""TALKS"" and ""BASIL"" are good.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""TALKS"" because it includes T, L, K, S which are all common.\n\nThe word we choose should be valid. Assuming both are valid words.\n\nSo, let\'s guess ""TALKS"".\n\nIn summary:\n- We know \'A\' is in the word, but not at position 3. So we are testing it at position 2.\n- We are introducing T, L, K, S to see which ones are present.\n\nIf we get feedback that any of these are in the word, we can narrow down.\n\nLet me write the guess in the required format.\n\nBut note: the response should have <guess> and then the word.\n\nSo, my second guess: TALKS.\n\nBut let\'s double-check: \n- First guess CR: CRANE -> A is wrong position (position 3) -> so not in 3.\n- TALKS: T at 1, A at 2, L at 3, K at 4, S at 5.\n\nWe are testing A in position 2 and also testing T, L, K, S.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word (all marked \'x\').\n- A is in the secret word but in the wrong position (marked \'-\').

Include A (because we know it\'s in the word) but not in position 3.\n2. Avoid using C, R, N, E.\n3. Choose a word with letters that are common in 5-letter words to gain more information.\n\nConsidering words that include A and positions to try A:\n- A can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since position 3 is eliminated).\n- We also want to cover other common letters. Letters like S, T, L, I, O, U, etc., are good choices because they appear frequently.\n\nPossible words:\n- Trying A in position 2: words like SALTY, SAULT, etc. But we have limited knowledge of what\'s available.\n- We need a word that uses new letters to maximize information.\n\nA good candidate is ""TALKS"":\n- T in position 1\n- A in position 2 (new position for A)\n- L in position 3\n- K in position 4\n- S in position 5\n\nThis word uses A in a different position and introduces T, L, K, S – all common letters not ruled out.\n\nAlternative: ""PLAIT"" but it has I and T, and A in position 3? Wait, no: PLAIT would have A in position 3? Let\'s check:\nP-L-A-I-T -> position 3: A? But we cannot put A in position 3. So no.\n\nOr ""STALK""? But S and T are new, A in position 3? No, because A cannot be in position 3. ""STALK"" has A in position 3? Yes: S-T-A-L-K -> position 3 is A. So invalid for A position.\n\nTherefore, ""TALKS"" is valid with A in position 2.\n\nAnother candidate: ""PASTA"" but it has P and S, but also two A\'s? We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Since we haven\'t ruled out duplicates, but the feedback hasn\'t indicated any duplicate issues. But we want distinct letters to maximize information. ""PASTA"" has duplicate A? P-A-S-T-A -> two A\'s. It might cause confusion if the word has only one A. Better to avoid duplicates.\n\n""TALKS"" has all distinct letters: T, A, L, K, S.\n\nSo we choose ""TALKS"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n\n- **C, R, N, E**: Not in the word at all (marked \'x\').\n- **A**: Present in the word but not in position 3 (marked \'-\').\n\nFor the second guess, we need to:\n1. **Include A** in a position other than 3 (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).\n2. **Exclude C, R, N, E** entirely.\n3. Use **new, common letters** to maximize information gain.\n\nThe word **""TALKS""** is chosen because:\n- It places A in position 2 (testing a new position).\n- It introduces **T, L, K, S** (common letters not previously tested).\n- All letters are distinct, avoiding redundancy for clearer feedback.\n\nThis guess will help identify:\n- If T, L, K, or S are in the secret word.\n- If A is correctly positioned at index 2.\n- Further positional information about A if the feedback returns \'-\' again.\n\n<guess>TALKS</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: and then the word.\n\nSo, my second guess: TALKS.\n\nBut let\'s double-check: \n- First guess CR: CRANE -> A is wrong position (position 3) -> so not in 3.\n- TALKS: T at 1, A at 2, L at 3, K at 4, S at 5.\n\nWe are testing A in position 2 and also testing T, L, K, S.\n</think>\nBased on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word (all marked \'x\').\n- A is in the secret word but in the wrong position (marked \'-\').

Since it was in position 2 here, it cannot be in position 2 either.\n   - S is marked wrong position (so S is in the word but not in position 5).\n   - T, L, K are not in the word.\n\nCurrent knowledge:\n- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, T, L, K (cannot be in the word).\n- **Present letters with positions ruled out**:\n  - A: cannot be in position 3 (from CRANE) and cannot be in position 2 (from TALKS). So it must be in position 1, 4, or 5.\n  - S: cannot be in position 5. So S must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nSince S is in the word (but not position 5) and A is in the word (but not positions 2 or 3), possible positions:\n- A: positions 1, 4, 5\n- S: positions 1, 2, 3, 4\n\nAlso, note that the word has 5 letters, and we need a word that includes both A and S, and excludes the absent letters.\n\nWe must also use only letters that are either A, S, or new letters not yet tested (since we know T, L, K are absent).\n\nList of absent letters: C, R, N, E, T, L, K → 7 letters ruled out.\n\nWe have 26 - 7 = 19 letters potentially available, but we should prioritize common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nNew guess must:\n- Include A (in position 1, 4, or 5)\n- Include S (in position 1, 2, 3, or 4, but note positions cannot overlap)\n- Avoid using any absent letters: C, R, N, E, T, L, K\n\nPossible word ideas:\n\n- Option 1: Place A in position 1 and S in position 4? Example: A _ _ S _\n- Option 2: Place A in position 4 and S in position 1? Example: S _ _ A _\n- Option 3: Place A in position 5 and S in position 1? Example: S _ _ _ A\n\nWe need to fill the other two blanks with new letters. Let\'s brainstorm:\n\nFor Option 1 (A _ _ S _):\n- Words: ABIAS? That has two A\'s. But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Alternatively: ACHAS? But C is not allowed (absent). Or ADIOS? But O and I are allowed? ADIOS: A, D, I, O, S → letters: D, I, O are new.\n\nADIOS: A in pos1, S in pos5? But S is in pos5? That would be invalid because TALKS had S in pos5 marked wrong, so S cannot be in pos5. Therefore, S must be in pos4? Then if word is A _ _ S _, then S is in pos4. Then the last position is blank. For example: ""AMBOS"" - but it has M, B, O. But S in pos5? No, AMBOS: A M B O S → S is in pos5 → invalid! So we must put S in position 4? Then the word shape: A ?1 ?2 S ?5. Then ?5 must be a letter.\n\nAnother idea: ""APSIS"" but S repeated. Or ""AXIS"" - only 4 letters. We need 5 letters.\n\nAlternative: Place A in position 4 and S in position 1? So: S _ _ A _\n\nWords: SOFAS? But O, F, A, S. Positions: S(1), O(2), F(3), A(4), S(5) -> S repeated and position 5 for S is invalid because TALKS S was in pos5 marked wrong. So S cannot be at end.\n\nSOFAS has S at start and end? That would require S to appear twice? But we don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters. However, TALKS S was marked \'-\' meaning S is in the word but not position 5, but it doesn\'t say how many S\'s. So there could be two S\'s? But we avoid duplicates to get clearer info.\n\nBetter to assume no duplicates unless forced? So let\'s avoid duplicates for now if possible.\n\nBack to positions:\n- A must be in 1,4,5\n- S must be in 1,2,3,4 but note: position 1 cannot be shared with A unless we have two letters? No, each position is unique.\n\nSo to avoid conflict, let\'s not put both in position 1. We can put S in 1 and A in 4? Or S in 1 and A in 5? Or S in 4 and A in 1? Etc.\n\nTry S in position 1 and A in position 4: word ""S _ _ A _""\n\nCommon words: ""SPOAS""? Not standard. ""SHOAS""? Not common.\n\nPerhaps ""SWAGY""? Not a word.\n\nAnother: ""SUDAS""? Not word.\n\nAlternatively, place A in position 1 and S in position 4: word ""A _ _ S _""\n\nExamples: ""ABASS"" - not valid. ""ADISS"" - no. ""APHIS"" - 5 letters? A P H I S → positions: A(1), P(2), H(3), I(4)? Wait, if S is in pos5? We need S in pos4? Then word like: ""AMISS"" but S at the end? It\'s pos5: A M I S S → S in pos4? In AMISS: positions: A(1), M(2), I(3), S(4), S(5). But S(5) is invalid because TALKS S in pos5 was wrong. Also, S repeated.\n\nAlternative: ""AISLE"" → A(1), I(2), S(3), L(4), E(5). But L(4) is L? But L is absent! Because TALKS L was marked x. And E is absent (from CRANE). So cannot use L or E.\n\nWe must avoid absent letters: C, R, N, E, T, L, K.\n\nLet\'s list allowed letters: Alphabet minus absent: A, B, D, F, G, H, I, M, O, P, S, U, V, W, Y, etc. (and S is present, A is present).\n\nTry a word with A in position 4 and S in position 3? But we need to fill others.\n\nAnother idea: Place A in position 5? Since it must be in 1,4,5 and we haven\'t tested 5 or 1.\n\nConsider: S in position 1 and A in position 5: _ _ _ _ A → but we have S first. Word: S _ _ _ A\n\nExamples: ""SOFTA"" -> T and A? T is absent, so no.\n\n""SQUAB"" -> Q,U,A,B → but A is in position 5? Positions: S(1), Q(2), U(3), A(4)? Wait, A is in position 4? But we put A in position 5? In SQUAB: A is in position5? SQUAB: S Q U A B → A at position 4? Actually: S(1), Q(2), U(3), A(4), B(5). So A at 4 → valid? We want A at 5? But it\'s at 4? We can have A at 4? Positions for A: 1,4,5 are all possible.\n\nBut SQUAB: Q is rare? And U, B. Also, S at 1 is tested? But in TALKS, S was at 5 and marked wrong position, which tells us S is present but not 5. Doesn\'t say about other positions.\n\nS in position 1 might be okay? But we can test it.\n\nBetter word: ""SWOYA""? Not valid.\n\nMaybe ""SHIVA"" -> S H I V A → positions: S(1), H(2), I(3), V(4), A(5). This has A in position 5 (not tested before) and S in position 1 (new position). Letters: H, I, V are new.\n\nBut is SHIVA a common word? In word games, it is often accepted.\n\nAnother: ""SKIMP"" but K is absent.\n\nAvoid K.\n\nLet\'s think of words with S and A that fit the constraints.\n\nPerhaps: ""PIOUS"" but no A? Must include A.\n\n""AUDIO"" → A U D I O → A(1), then U(2), D(3), I(4), O(5). But S is not included? We must include S because we know it\'s in the word? Yes! From TALKS feedback, S is present and must be included.\n\nSo the word must have both A and S.\n\nIgnored that earlier? Yes! Because we know S is in the word (marked \'-\' in TALKS position 5).\n\nSo the guess must include A and S.\n\nThus, we need a word containing A and S, with positions:\n- A not in 2 or 3 → positions 1,4,5\n- S not in 5 → positions 1,2,3,4\n\nAnd exclude C,R,N,E,T,L,K.\n\nPossible configurations:\n\nCase 1: A in position 1, S in position 2,3, or 4? Avoid S in 1 since it would conflict? No, if A is at 1, S cannot be at 1. So S at 2,3, or 4.\n\nExample: A in pos1, S in pos2: ""A S _ _ _""\n- Words: ""ASSAY"" → two S and Y? Positions: A(1), S(2), S(3), A(4)? No, ASSAY: A S S A Y → S in 2 and 3? But we don\'t know duplicates. And A at1 and4? Might be confusing. Avoid duplicates? Better: ""ASKED"" but K and E absent.\n\nNo good.\n\nA in pos1, S in pos3: ""A _ S _ _""\n- Words: ""AISLE"" → A(1), I(2), S(3), L(4), E(5) → but L and E absent → invalid.\n\n""AMUSE""→ A(1), M(2), U(3), S(4), E(5) → E absent? E forbidden (CRANE x). So no.\n\n""APHIS"" → A(1), P(2), H(3), I(4), S(5)? But S(5) is invalid because TALKS showed S cannot be at5. So no. We need S not at5? So in ""A _ S _ _"", if S is pos3, then the last two positions must not be S? But we need to avoid S at5.\n\nIn this case, S at3 is allowed? TALKS said S not at5, not about pos3.\n\nBut in word like ""APHIS"" it would have S at5? Which is bad. So we need a word for positions: A(1), then S in pos3, and the last two non-S? Example: ""ADZES"" → A(1), D(2), Z(3), E(4), S(5) → S@5 invalid and E absent. \n\nCase: A in pos1, S in pos4: ""A _ _ S _""\nThen the word has pattern ""A ?1 ?2 S ?5""\nWe must fill ?1, ?2, ?5 with allowed letters excluding C,R,N,E,T,L,K.\nAlso, ?5 cannot be S?

We have feedback from four guesses:

1. **CRANE**: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - C, R, N, E are absent.

2. **TALKS**: T(x), A(-), L(x), K(x), S(-)
   - A is in the word but not in position 2 (new position ruled out).
   - S is in the word but not in position 5.
   - T, L, K are absent.

3. **SOFIA**: S(✓), O(x), F(x), I(-), A(✓)
   - S is correct and in position 1 (✓).
   - A is correct and in position 5 (✓).
   - O and F are absent (x).
   - I is in the word but not in position 4 (-).

**Key insights:**
- The secret word has: 
  - S in position 1 (from SOFIA: S✓).
  - A in position 5 (from SOFIA: A✓).
- A must be in pos 5 (positions 2 and 3 were ruled out earlier).
- Other present letters: 
  - I is in the word but not in position 4 (from SOFIA: I(-)).
- Ruled-out positions for I: position 4.
- Absent letters: C, R, N, E, T, L, K, O, F.

**Remaining structure of the secret word:**
S _ _ _ A  
Position 1: S  
Position 2: Unknown  
Position 3: Unknown  
Position 4: Unknown (but cannot be I, since I is misplaced in that position)  
Position 5: A

**Present letters we know:**
- A (in pos 5)
- S (in pos 1)
- I (somewhere, but not in pos 4; possible positions: 2 or 3)
- Missing one more letter? The word has 5 letters: S, ?, ?, ?, A. With I somewhere, meaning positions 2 or 3 must be I? Or another letter? Since we know S and A, and I is present, but we don't know if there are other letters.

We have at least three known present letters: S, A, I. The other two positions must be filled with letters not ruled out.

**Absent letters (exclude these):** C, R, N, E, T, L, K, O, F → Total: 9 absent letters.

**Possible letters for positions 2, 3, 4:** Remainder of alphabet minus absentees: B, D, G, H, I, M, P, U, V, W, Y, and maybe others (since I is confirmed present, and we need to use it).

I must be in positions 2 or 3? It can be in position 2 or 3 because position 4 is ruled out? From SOFIA: I was guessed in position 4 and marked ""-"", meaning it's in the word but not in that position. Therefore, I could be in pos 2 or 3? Positions:
- Position 4 is ruled out for I? Yes.
- Other positions possible? Position 1 is S? Already occupied. Position 5 is A? Occupied. So I can only be in positions 2 or 3? Exactly.

Secret word pattern: S [position 2] [position 3] [position 4] A  
- Position 4 cannot be I? Correct.
- I must be in either position 2 or 3? Exactly.

**For the next guess:**
- We need to test letters for positions 2, 3, and 4.
- Since I must be in position 2 or 3, we can discover which by placing I in one position.
- Also, position 4 is unknown and must be filled with a new letter.

**Possible words:**  
The secret word is S _ _ _ A  
Known letters: S (1), A (5), I must be in 2 or 3? And position 4 is a letter that hasn't been guessed? 

Start by placing I in position 2: then the word is S I ? ? A  
Then position 3 and 4 need letters? But we have limited information.

Or place I in position 3: S ? I ? A  
Then position 2 and 4 needed.

Also, we must choose letters for the unknown positions; only B, D, G, H, I, M, P, U, V, W, Y available (allowed letters minus absentees)? I is already used? Let's see.

Allowed letters: B, D, G, H, M, P, U, V, W, Y (I is already present, but for new letters).

Since I is known to be in the word, but we have not tested its position, we should prioritize confirming I's position.

**Target goal:**  
Find a word that:
- Starts with S (fixed)
- Ends with A (fixed)
- Includes I (in pos 2 or 3)
- Position 4: something
- All letters (except S, I, A) must be new and not ruled out.

Also, avoids using absent letters: C, R, N, E, T, L, K, O, F.

Possible words:

1. If I is in position 2: pattern S I ? ? A  
   - Example: ""SILVA"" → Letters: S, I, L, V, A → L is absent? Ruled out? Guess 2: TALKS had L marked 'x' so L absent? Yes.
   - ""SIMBA"" → M, B → both new? But SIMBA not common? 
   - ""SIPRA"" → P, R → R absent? CRANE R is absent? Yes.
   - ""SIDDA"" → D, D? Duplicate D, and D new? Not optimal.

Not easy? Let's consider I in position 3: pattern S ? I ? A  
- Then position 2 and 4: two letters?
- Example: ""SHIVA"" → S H I V A → Positions: S(1) H(2) I(3) V(4) A(5)? V is new? Yes.
- SHIVA is a proper noun but often accepted? Or ""SHIA"" only 4 letters? No? SH I V A → 5 letters? Positions: H in pos2, I in pos3, V in pos4? Yes.

Could use SHIVA? But H,V new? Yes.

Alternative: ""SPINA"" → P, N → N absent? CRANE marked N 'x' so yes.

Or ""SKIJA"" → K absent.

Another: ""SMITH"" → M, I, T, H → T absent? TALKS T 'x' yes? T is absent.

Not working.

Better: ""SWIMA"" → W, M? But SWIMA not standard.

Perhaps ""DYING"" no.

Use common entries: ""SAVOR"" → R absent? Yes.

""SHYVA"" not word.

At last: Consider I in position 2? Word: ""SIXTH""→ X, T, H? T absent? Yes.

Might as well use ""SHIVA"" or ""SULFA""? But S U L F A? L absent, F absent (SOFIA F 'x').

F ruled out? SOFIA F marked 'x' → absent? Yes.

So not.

Other word: ""SCREAM"" too long.

Focus on pattern: S _ _ _ A  
With I in second or third position.

**Choose ""SHIMA""**: H, I, M, A? Positions: S H I M A → Then I is in position3? Pattern: S H I M A? Could be, but common? Or ""SHYMA"" not.

Better: **""SHIPY""**? Not word.

**""SWIFT""**: S W I F T? But F and T absent? F: SOFIA F 'x', T: TALKS T 'x' → both absent? So no.

Hard to find valid words.

Try I in position 2: S I B _ A? Position 4: letter.
""SI B _ A"" → ""SIBYA"" not word; ""SIBMA"" not common? 

Word: ""SIMBA""? M,B → not common? Or ""SIMHA"" not English.

Perhaps ""SIMPA"" not.

Then for I in position 3: S H I P A? ""SHIPA"" → S H I P A? Positions: H in2, I in3, P in4? P allowed? Yes? Word? SHIPA isn't common.

Acceptable words: 
- ""SHIVA"" S H I V A → with H in2, I in3, V in4? V allowed? 
- ""SUIVA"" U,I,V,A? Positions S U I V A? U in2, I in3, V in4? 
But SUIVA not standard.

Another: ""SCUTA"" C absent.

I have it: **""SWING""** no A.

Worse: ""SIZAR"" R absent and Z rare.

We must include A? The word ends with A? In our word choices, we should have S ... A.

List all possible 5-letter English words with S first, A last, and I in position 2 or 3? And letters within allowed set? Not R,L etc.

Example of common words:
- ""SHASTA"" → too long? 
No, ""SHOTA"" 5 letters? S H O T A? But O is absent? SOFIA O 'x'? Yes, ruled out? O is absent.

- ""SCUD A"" not.

- ""SPINA"" N absent? N forbidden? Yes.

Alternative: **""SAUNA""** → S A U N A? But A in position2? Which is already ruled out? From TALKS? TALKS had A in position2 and marked '-', meaning wrong position? So A cannot be in position2? And also earlier? Positions: S1 A2 U3 N4 A5 → A at pos2? Invalid! N absent? Also? CRANE N 'x' yes? So forbidden.

Therefore, cannot.

**Acceptable word: ""SWAMI""** → S W A M I? But A in position3? Invalid! CRANE and TALKS ruled out position 3 for A? So no.

A is fixed at position 5? Yes! In all words we guess, A must be at5.

Therefore, we need a word S ? ? ? A with I in2 or3? And unknown letters.

Try: **""SOLID""** → no A.

How about **""SALAD""**? S A L A D → A at pos2? Ruled out? Yes? TALKS showed A not in2. L absent? L 'x' from TALKS? Also? D new? But A in2 invalid.

Not usable.

At this point: **""SHV A""** not.

Perhaps ""SLYVA"" not common.

Another idea: ""DIGEST"" no.

Let's think: The secret word is S _ _ _ A with I in position2 or 3.

Use ""SIXTH"" etc.? Not.

Perhaps ""SHI   A"" with position 4 empty? No? 5 letters.

Finally, a valid word: **""SHIELD""** no A.

Accept ""SHIVA"" as it is? S, H, I, V, A.

Letters:
- S(1) = correct
- H(2) = new? Not tested
- I(3) = present? Could be? Position: placing I in position3? But SOFIA had I in position4? Marked '-', meaning I is present? But not pos4. So pos3 possible.
- V(4) = new
- A(5) = correct

So ""SHIV A"" is S H I V A? Positions: S(1), H(2), I(3), V(4), A(5)

Why not? We can test? H and V are new letters.

If this isn't common, try ""SUPRA"" S U P R A? R absent? Yes.

Alternatives: ""S B I G A"" not word.

Or ""SMUGS"" no A.

**Better choice**: ""SYLVA"" S Y L V A? L absent? Yes? Cannot.

""PYGMY"" not.

I think ""SHIVA"" is the best? Or ""SHIA"" too short.

Or ""SIMI A"" no.

After research, consider ""SHINE"" no A.

Not ideal? But ""SHIVA"" might be accepted.

To be safer: **""SPLIT""** no A.

Last: ""SWAMI"" has A in wrong position.

OK, accept ""SHIVA"".

Or consider I in position2: S I new new A.

For example: ""SIGMA"" → S I G M A? Positions: S1 I2 G3 M4 A5? G and M new? Could be? Words: ""SIGMA"" is common? Meaning Greek letter.

Then compared to SHIVA? Both possible? But let's choose ""SIGMA"" because it is more commonly used? Or ""SIMBA"" but less common.

""SIGMA"": letters G and M allowed? Not ruled out.

SOFIA didn't rule G or M? No? Absent letters are C,R,N,E,T,L,K,O,F? So G and M are new.

Therefore, ""SIGMA"" can be used? Positions: S1 I2 G3 M4 A5? I is at position2? If the feedback shows I in wrong position, then we know I must be in position3? Or vice versa.

""SIGMA"":

- S at1: correct? Already fixed? But position? In secret word S is fixed in pos1? Yes? So S should be ✓ if guessed pos1? But in ""SIGMA"" it is pos1? So should be ✓? Secret word has S at1? Correct? So the S should be marked ✓.

Similarly A at5? Already known? Should be ✓.

Now I: if we place I at pos2? If secret word has I at pos3, feedback will mark I(-) meaning? Wrong position? If it has I at pos2?, then ✓.

Similarly, G and M: new.

The guess will give us:
- Position1: S ✓ (known)
- Position2: I? Will tell us if correct position or not? If I at pos2 is ✓? Then I is in pos2? Else, if marked '-', then I is in pos3? Because no other positions? Since SOFIA ruled pos4 for I? So only pos2 or3.

Similarly for other.

So ""SIGMA"" is good.

Another: ""SIDHA"" not English.

Choose ""SIGMA""

<guess>SIGMA</guess>We have to return guess. Or ""SHIVA""? Both are possible? But ""SIGMA"" is more standard? Yes.

The word must be S I G M A.
</think>
Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

1. **CRANE**: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
   - A is present but not in position 3.
   - C, R, N, E are absent.

2. **TALKS**: T(x), A(-), L(x), K(x), S(-)  
   - A is present but not in position 2.
   - S is present but not in position 5.
   - T, L, K are absent.

3. **SOFIA**: S(✓), O(x), F(x), I(-), A(✓)  
   - S is correct in position 1 (✓ confirmed).
   - O and F are absent.
   - I is present but not in position 4.
   - A is correct in position 5 (✓ confirmed).

**Key deductions:**
- Secret word structure: **S _ _ _ A** (positions: S in 1, A in 5).
- I is present and must be in position 2 or 3 (position 4 ruled out by SOFIA feedback: I(-)).
- Absent letters: C, R, N, E, T, L, K, O, F (excluded from guess).
- Possible letters for positions 2, 3, 4: B, D, G, H, I, M, P, U, V, W, Y (I is confirmed present but position unknown).

For guess 4:
- Goal: Resolve the position of I (test if it belongs in pos 2 or 3) and gain new letter information.
- Chosen word: **SIGMA**  
  - S (position 1): Fixed and correct (✓ from SOFIA).
  - I (position 2): Tests if I is correctly placed here.
  - G (position 3): New letter test.
  - M (position 4): New letter test.
  - A (position 5): Fixed and correct (✓ from SOFIA).
- If I is marked ✓, it confirms position 2; if marked (-), it must be in position 3.
- G and M provide new information.

This guess maximizes information by testing I's position directly while introducing two new common letters.

<guess>SIGMA</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback:

- **SOFIA** confirmed that S is in position 1 and A is in position 5: Secret word pattern is **S _ _ _ A**.
- **SOFIA** also showed I is present but not in position 4, so I must be in position 2 or 3.
- Absent letters are C, R, N, E, T, L, K, O, F → Possible letters for middle positions: B, D, G, H, I, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

For guess 4, the word **SIGMA** is chosen because:
- It fits the pattern S _ _ _ A.
- It tests I in position 2 (will reveal if I is correct here or if it belongs in position 3).
- It introduces new common letters G and M for additional feedback.
- All letters are distinct and not ruled out.

This guess maximizes positional clarity and letter coverage.

<guess>SIGMA</guess>",SIGMA,"We have feedback from four guesses:

1. **CRANE**: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - C, R, N, E are absent.

2. **TALKS**: T(x), A(-), L(x), K(x), S(-)
   - A is in the word but not in position 2 (new position ruled out).
   - S is in the word but not in position 5.
   - T, L, K are absent.

3. **SOFIA**: S(✓), O(x), F(x), I(-), A(✓)

   - A is correct and in position 5 (✓).
   - O and F are absent (x).
   - I is in the word but not in position 4 (-).

**Key insights:**
- The secret word has:

  - A in position 5 (from SOFIA: A✓).
- A must be in pos 5 (positions 2 and 3 were ruled out earlier).
- Other present letters:

- Ruled-out positions for I: position 4.
- Absent letters: C, R, N, E, T, L, K, O, F.

**Remaining structure of the secret word:**
S _ _ _ A  
Position 1: S  
Position 2: Unknown  
Position 3: Unknown  
Position 4: Unknown (but cannot be I, since I is misplaced in that position)  
Position 5: A

**Present letters we know:**
- A (in pos 5)
- S (in pos 1)
- I (somewhere, but not in pos 4; possible positions: 2 or 3)
- Missing one more letter? The word has 5 letters: S, ?, ?, ?, A. With I somewhere, meaning positions 2 or 3 must be I? Or another letter? Since we know S and A, and I is present, but we don't know if there are other letters.

We have at least three known present letters: S, A, I. The other two positions must be filled with letters not ruled out.

**Absent letters (exclude these):** C, R, N, E, T, L, K, O, F → Total: 9 absent letters.

**Possible letters for positions 2, 3, 4:** Remainder of alphabet minus absentees: B, D, G, H, I, M, P, U, V, W, Y, and maybe others (since I is confirmed present, and we need to use it).

I must be in positions 2 or 3? It can be in position 2 or 3 because position 4 is ruled out? From SOFIA: I was guessed in position 4 and marked ""-"", meaning it's in the word but not in that position. Therefore, I could be in pos 2 or 3? Positions:
- Position 4 is ruled out for I? Yes.
- Other positions possible? Position 1 is S? Already occupied. Position 5 is A? Occupied. So I can only be in positions 2 or 3? Exactly.

Secret word pattern: S [position 2] [position 3] [position 4] A  
- Position 4 cannot be I? Correct.
- I must be in either position 2 or 3? Exactly.

**For the next guess:**
- We need to test letters for positions 2, 3, and 4.
- Since I must be in position 2 or 3, we can discover which by placing I in one position.
- Also, position 4 is unknown and must be filled with a new letter.

**Possible words:**  
The secret word is S _ _ _ A  
Known letters: S (1), A (5), I must be in 2 or 3? And position 4 is a letter that hasn't been guessed? 

Start by placing I in position 2: then the word is S I ? ? A  
Then position 3 and 4 need letters? But we have limited information.

Or place I in position 3: S ? I ? A  
Then position 2 and 4 needed.

Also, we must choose letters for the unknown positions; only B, D, G, H, I, M, P, U, V, W, Y available (allowed letters minus absentees)? I is already used? Let's see.

Allowed letters: B, D, G, H, M, P, U, V, W, Y (I is already present, but for new letters).

Since I is known to be in the word, but we have not tested its position, we should prioritize confirming I's position.

**Target goal:**  
Find a word that:
- Starts with S (fixed)
- Ends with A (fixed)
- Includes I (in pos 2 or 3)
- Position 4: something
- All letters (except S, I, A) must be new and not ruled out.

Also, avoids using absent letters: C, R, N, E, T, L, K, O, F.

Possible words:

1. If I is in position 2: pattern S I ? ? A  
   - Example: ""SILVA"" → Letters: S, I, L, V, A → L is absent? Ruled out? Guess 2: TALKS had L marked 'x' so L absent? Yes.
   - ""SIMBA"" → M, B → both new? But SIMBA not common? 
   - ""SIPRA"" → P, R → R absent? CRANE R is absent? Yes.
   - ""SIDDA"" → D, D? Duplicate D, and D new? Not optimal.

Not easy? Let's consider I in position 3: pattern S ? I ? A  
- Then position 2 and 4: two letters?
- Example: ""SHIVA"" → S H I V A → Positions: S(1) H(2) I(3) V(4) A(5)? V is new? Yes.
- SHIVA is a proper noun but often accepted? Or ""SHIA"" only 4 letters? No? SH I V A → 5 letters? Positions: H in pos2, I in pos3, V in pos4? Yes.

Could use SHIVA? But H,V new? Yes.

Alternative: ""SPINA"" → P, N → N absent? CRANE marked N 'x' so yes.

Or ""SKIJA"" → K absent.

Another: ""SMITH"" → M, I, T, H → T absent? TALKS T 'x' yes? T is absent.

Not working.

Better: ""SWIMA"" → W, M? But SWIMA not standard.

Perhaps ""DYING"" no.

Use common entries: ""SAVOR"" → R absent? Yes.

""SHYVA"" not word.

At last: Consider I in position 2? Word: ""SIXTH""→ X, T, H? T absent? Yes.

Might as well use ""SHIVA"" or ""SULFA""? But S U L F A? L absent, F absent (SOFIA F 'x').

F ruled out? SOFIA F marked 'x' → absent? Yes.

So not.

Other word: ""SCREAM"" too long.

Focus on pattern: S _ _ _ A  
With I in second or third position.

**Choose ""SHIMA""**: H, I, M, A? Positions: S H I M A → Then I is in position3? Pattern: S H I M A? Could be, but common? Or ""SHYMA"" not.

Better: **""SHIPY""**? Not word.

**""SWIFT""**: S W I F T? But F and T absent? F: SOFIA F 'x', T: TALKS T 'x' → both absent? So no.

Hard to find valid words.

Try I in position 2: S I B _ A? Position 4: letter.
""SI B _ A"" → ""SIBYA"" not word; ""SIBMA"" not common? 

Word: ""SIMBA""? M,B → not common? Or ""SIMHA"" not English.

Perhaps ""SIMPA"" not.

Then for I in position 3: S H I P A? ""SHIPA"" → S H I P A? Positions: H in2, I in3, P in4? P allowed? Yes? Word? SHIPA isn't common.

Acceptable words: 
- ""SHIVA"" S H I V A → with H in2, I in3, V in4? V allowed? 
- ""SUIVA"" U,I,V,A? Positions S U I V A? U in2, I in3, V in4? 
But SUIVA not standard.

Another: ""SCUTA"" C absent.

I have it: **""SWING""** no A.

Worse: ""SIZAR"" R absent and Z rare.

We must include A? The word ends with A? In our word choices, we should have S ... A.

List all possible 5-letter English words with S first, A last, and I in position 2 or 3? And letters within allowed set? Not R,L etc.

Example of common words:
- ""SHASTA"" → too long? 
No, ""SHOTA"" 5 letters? S H O T A? But O is absent? SOFIA O 'x'? Yes, ruled out? O is absent.

- ""SCUD A"" not.

- ""SPINA"" N absent? N forbidden? Yes.

Alternative: **""SAUNA""** → S A U N A? But A in position2? Which is already ruled out? From TALKS? TALKS had A in position2 and marked '-', meaning wrong position? So A cannot be in position2? And also earlier? Positions: S1 A2 U3 N4 A5 → A at pos2? Invalid! N absent? Also? CRANE N 'x' yes? So forbidden.

Therefore, cannot.

**Acceptable word: ""SWAMI""** → S W A M I? But A in position3? Invalid! CRANE and TALKS ruled out position 3 for A? So no.

A is fixed at position 5? Yes! In all words we guess, A must be at5.

Therefore, we need a word S ? ? ? A with I in2 or3? And unknown letters.

Try: **""SOLID""** → no A.

How about **""SALAD""**? S A L A D → A at pos2? Ruled out? Yes? TALKS showed A not in2. L absent? L 'x' from TALKS? Also? D new? But A in2 invalid.

Not usable.

At this point: **""SHV A""** not.

Perhaps ""SLYVA"" not common.

Another idea: ""DIGEST"" no.

Let's think: The secret word is S _ _ _ A with I in position2 or 3.

Use ""SIXTH"" etc.? Not.

Perhaps ""SHI   A"" with position 4 empty? No? 5 letters.

Finally, a valid word: **""SHIELD""** no A.

Accept ""SHIVA"" as it is? S, H, I, V, A.

Letters:
- S(1) = correct
- H(2) = new? Not tested
- I(3) = present? Could be? Position: placing I in position3? But SOFIA had I in position4? Marked '-', meaning I is present? But not pos4. So pos3 possible.
- V(4) = new
- A(5) = correct

So ""SHIV A"" is S H I V A? Positions: S(1), H(2), I(3), V(4), A(5)

Why not? We can test? H and V are new letters.

If this isn't common, try ""SUPRA"" S U P R A? R absent? Yes.

Alternatives: ""S B I G A"" not word.

Or ""SMUGS"" no A.

**Better choice**: ""SYLVA"" S Y L V A? L absent? Yes? Cannot.

""PYGMY"" not.

I think ""SHIVA"" is the best? Or ""SHIA"" too short.

Or ""SIMI A"" no.

After research, consider ""SHINE"" no A.

Not ideal? But ""SHIVA"" might be accepted.

To be safer: **""SPLIT""** no A.

Last: ""SWAMI"" has A in wrong position.

OK, accept ""SHIVA"".

Or consider I in position2: S I new new A.

For example: ""SIGMA"" → S I G M A? Positions: S1 I2 G3 M4 A5? G and M new? Could be? Words: ""SIGMA"" is common? Meaning Greek letter.

Then compared to SHIVA? Both possible? But let's choose ""SIGMA"" because it is more commonly used? Or ""SIMBA"" but less common.

""SIGMA"": letters G and M allowed? Not ruled out.

SOFIA didn't rule G or M? No? Absent letters are C,R,N,E,T,L,K,O,F? So G and M are new.

Therefore, ""SIGMA"" can be used? Positions: S1 I2 G3 M4 A5? I is at position2? If the feedback shows I in wrong position, then we know I must be in position3? Or vice versa.

""SIGMA"":

- S at1: correct? Already fixed? But position? In secret word S is fixed in pos1? Yes? So S should be ✓ if guessed pos1? But in ""SIGMA"" it is pos1? So should be ✓? Secret word has S at1? Correct? So the S should be marked ✓.

Similarly A at5? Already known? Should be ✓.

Now I: if we place I at pos2? If secret word has I at pos3, feedback will mark I(-) meaning? Wrong position? If it has I at pos2?, then ✓.

Similarly, G and M: new.

The guess will give us:
- Position1: S ✓ (known)
- Position2: I? Will tell us if correct position or not? If I at pos2 is ✓? Then I is in pos2? Else, if marked '-', then I is in pos3? Because no other positions? Since SOFIA ruled pos4 for I? So only pos2 or3.

Similarly for other.

So ""SIGMA"" is good.

Another: ""SIDHA"" not English.

Choose ""SIGMA""

<guess>SIGMA</guess>We have to return guess. Or ""SHIVA""? Both are possible? But ""SIGMA"" is more standard? Yes.

The word must be S I G M A.Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

1. **CRANE**: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
   - A is present but not in position 3.
   - C, R, N, E are absent.

2. **TALKS**: T(x), A(-), L(x), K(x), S(-)  
   - A is present but not in position 2.
   - S is present but not in position 5.
   - T, L, K are absent.

3. **SOFIA**: S(✓), O(x), F(x), I(-), A(✓)  
   - S is correct in position 1 (✓ confirmed).
   - O and F are absent.
   - I is present but not in position 4.
   - A is correct in position 5 (✓ confirmed).

**Key deductions:**
- Secret word structure: **S _ _ _ A** (positions: S in 1, A in 5).
- I is present and must be in position 2 or 3 (position 4 ruled out by SOFIA feedback: I(-)).
- Absent letters: C, R, N, E, T, L, K, O, F (excluded from guess).
- Possible letters for positions 2, 3, 4: B, D, G, H, I, M, P, U, V, W, Y (I is confirmed present but position unknown).

For guess 4:
- Goal: Resolve the position of I (test if it belongs in pos 2 or 3) and gain new letter information.
- Chosen word: **SIGMA**  
  - S (position 1): Fixed and correct (✓ from SOFIA).
  - I (position 2): Tests if I is correctly placed here.
  - G (position 3): New letter test.
  - M (position 4): New letter test.
  - A (position 5): Fixed and correct (✓ from SOFIA).
- If I is marked ✓, it confirms position 2; if marked (-), it must be in position 3.
- G and M provide new information.

This guess maximizes information by testing I's position directly while introducing two new common letters.",Guess 5: SIGMA -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) I(✓) G(✓) M(✓) A(✓),SUCCESS
