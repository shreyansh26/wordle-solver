 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", ""RAISE"".
 I recall that ""RAISE"" is a good starter because it has two vowels (A, I) and three common consonants (R, S, E).
 Also, the letters in ""RAISE"" are quite common in 5-letter words.

I need to make the first guess for a 5-letter word. Since there's no prior feedback, I'll start with a word that includes common vowels and consonants to maximize coverage of likely letters. Good starting words often contain frequently used letters like R, S, T, L, N, E, A, and I. After considering options like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", and ""ROAST"", I choose **""RAISE""** because:  
- It uses 3 vowels (A, I, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S).  
- R, S, and E are among the top 10 most common letters in English.  
- This gives a high chance of revealing correct letters or positions early.

We are given feedback on the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so the second letter of the secret word is A)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so the fifth letter of the secret word is E)

So we know:
- The secret word has the form: _ A _ _ E
- The letters R, I, S are not in the word at all.

We need to make a second guess that is a 5-letter English word, with the second letter A and the fifth letter E, and without using R, I, S.

We also know that the word must have the pattern: [letter1] A [letter3] [letter4] E

We should avoid using R, I, S in any position.

Common letters that might appear: we can try to use other vowels (O, U) and common consonants (T, N, L, C, D, M, etc.).

Let's think of words that fit the pattern _ A _ _ E.

Some possibilities:
- TABLE: T A B L E -> but we have B and L, which haven't been tested.
- MAPLE: M A P L E -> P and L are new.
- CABLE: C A B L E -> B and L.
- DATE: too short, must be 5 letters.
- DANCE: D A N C E -> N and C.
- FABLE: F A B L E -> F, B, L.

But note: we must avoid R, I, S. So words containing these are invalid.

We also want to test new letters to get more information.

Let me list some words that fit the pattern and don't contain R, I, S:
- BAKED: B A K E D -> but the fifth letter is E, so it must be _ A _ _ E, so the last letter is E, so ""BAKED"" ends with D, not E. So invalid.
- We need the fifth letter to be E.

So words ending with ""E"" and having A as the second letter.

Common patterns: 
- Words like _A _ _ E: e.g., CAUSE, PAUSE, LARGE (but LARGE has R, which is forbidden), MANGE (M A N G E), MANGE is a word? Mange is a disease, but it's a word.

But we must avoid R, I, S.

Let me think of more:
- CANOE: C A N O E -> but the pattern is _ A _ _ E, so the third and fourth letters are N and O. This fits. And no R, I, S.
- However, CANOE has O and N, which are new.

Another one:
- MAPLE: M A P L E -> fits, and no R, I, S.

But we have two possibilities so far: CANOE and MAPLE.

We could also consider:
- TABLE: T A B L E -> no R, I, S? T, A, B, L, E -> yes, no R, I, S.

But we already have A and E in known positions, so we want to test new letters.

We have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more common letters.

Another word: ""DANCE"" - D A N C E -> no R, I, S.

But note: we know the second letter is A and the fifth is E, so we are focusing on the first, third, and fourth positions.

We want to maximize the chance of getting more feedback by using common letters that haven't been eliminated.

Eliminated letters: R, I, S.

Available letters: all others.

Common letters to test: T, N, L, C, D, O, U, M, P, etc.

I think ""TABLE"" is a good candidate because it uses T, B, L which are common.

But let's see if we can get more coverage.

Another word: ""PALME"" - but that's not a word, we need valid English words.

""MANGE"" is a word? M A N G E -> meaning a skin disease in animals, but it's acceptable.

But perhaps we can use more common words.

""DATE"" is 4 letters, so no.

""CAUSE"" has S? C A U S E -> but S is eliminated (from feedback, S is not in the word). So we cannot use S.

Similarly, ""PAUSE"" has S and U, but S is eliminated.

So avoid S.

Another word: ""LATTE"" - L A T T E -> but the fifth letter is E? ""LATTE"" ends with E? No, it ends with E? L-A-T-T-E, yes, it ends with E. But the pattern is _ A _ _ E, so L A T T E: second letter A, fifth letter E. And no R, I, S? L, A, T, T, E -> no R, I, S. But it has double T, which might be good to test T.

But ""LATTE"" is a valid word.

However, we have two T's, which might not be efficient if T is not in the word.

Another common word: ""DANCE"" - D A N C E -> no R, I, S.

Or ""MANGE"" - M A N G E.

But let's choose a word that uses more common consonants.

I recall that in Wordle, after knowing A and E in positions 2 and 5, common guesses include words like ""PLANE"" but that has L and N, but also we cannot use R? ""PLANE"" has no R? P-L-A-N-E, no R, but it has N and L. But wait, we cannot use S, but S is not in PLANE. However, we have eliminated R, I, S, so PLANE is allowed? PLANE: P, L, A, N, E. No R, I, S. So it's valid.

But the pattern: we need the second letter to be A and fifth to be E. In ""PLANE"", the second letter is L? P-L-A-N-E: positions: 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E. But we need the second letter to be A, but in PLANE the second letter is L, not A. So it doesn't fit the pattern.

We must have the second letter A and fifth letter E. So the word must be of the form: [letter1] A [letter3] [letter4] E.

So for ""PLANE"", it is P L A N E, which is not of the form _ A _ _ E because the A is in the third position, not the second.

So we need words where A is the second letter.

Examples: 
- CABLE: C A B L E
- FABLE: F A B L E
- TABLE: T A B L E
- MAPLE: M A P L E
- CANOE: C A N O E
- DANCE: D A N C E
- MANGE: M A N G E
- LANCE: L A N C E
- PANCE? Not a word.

We also have ""BAYLE"" not a word.

""GAFFE"": G A F F E -> but that has double F, and F is less common.

""HASTE"": H A S T E -> but S is eliminated, so we cannot use S.

So avoid S.

Another: ""LATKE"": L A T K E -> but LATKE is a word (potato pancake), and it fits: L A T K E, second letter A, fifth E, and no R, I, S.

But it has K, which is less common.

We want to test more common letters.

I think ""TABLE"" is a good choice: T, A, B, L, E. We know A and E are in place, so we are testing T, B, L in positions 1, 3, and 4.

Similarly, ""DANCE"" tests D, N, C.

But ""DANCE"" has N and C, which are common.

Another word: ""PALME"" is not standard, but ""PALLE"" not a word.

""VALVE"": V A L V E -> V is not very common, but it's a word.

But let's stick to more common words.

I think ""CANOE"" is a good option because it uses C, N, O, which are common and we haven't tested.

Similarly, ""MANGE"" uses M, N, G.

But G is less common.

Another word: ""CAPLE"" not a word.

""RADII"" has R and I, which are eliminated.

We must avoid R, I, S.

So let's choose between ""TABLE"", ""DANCE"", ""CANOE"", ""MAPLE"".

I think ""TABLE"" is a solid choice because:
- T is a very common letter.
- B and L are also common.
- It covers three new letters.

Similarly, ""DANCE"" covers D, N, C.

But ""CANOE"" has O, which is a vowel, and we haven't tested vowels much (only A and E are known to be in the word, but we don't know about others).

In the secret word, we know it has A and E, but we don't know if it has other vowels.

Since we have two positions open (first and third, fourth) we can test a word with O.

But ""CANOE"" has O in the fourth position and N in the third.

Another word: ""ABATE"" - A B A T E -> but the second letter is B? A is the first letter, so it would be A B A T E: positions: 1:A, 2:B, 3:A, 4:T, 5:E. But we need the second letter to be A, but here the second letter is B. So it doesn't fit.

We must have the second letter A, so the first letter can be any letter except R, I, S.

So for ""ABATE"", it doesn't work because the A is in position 1, not 2.

Similarly, ""ADAGE"" - A D A G E: second letter is D, not A.

So we need words that have A as the second character.

I think I'll go with ""TABLE"" for the second guess.

So the guess is ""TABLE"".

But let's confirm: T A B L E -> positions: 1:T, 2:A (correct), 3:B, 4:L, 5:E (correct). And no R, I, S.

Yes.

We can then see the feedback to narrow down.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, I, and S are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- A is in the correct position (second letter, marked with ""✓"").
- E is in the correct position (fifth letter, marked with ""✓"").

This means the secret word has the pattern: `_ A _ _ E`, and it does not contain R, I, or S. For the second guess:
- The word must have ""A"" as the second letter and ""E"" as the fifth letter.
- It should avoid using R, I, or S to test new letters.
- Common letters like T, B, L, N, C, O, etc., are good candidates to maximize information.

After considering options like ""DANCE"" (tests D, N, C), ""CANOE"" (tests C, N, O), and ""MAPLE"" (tests M, P, L), ""TABLE"" is chosen because:
- It fits the pattern `_ A _ _ E` (T A B L E).
- It tests three new common consonants (T, B, L) in positions 1, 3, and 4.
- It avoids eliminated letters (R, I, S).

This guess will help identify if T, B, or L are in the word and their positions, narrowing down possibilities for the next guess.

<guess>TABLE</guess>",TABLE,"We are given feedback on the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so the second letter of the secret word is A)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so the fifth letter of the secret word is E)

So we know:
- The secret word has the form: _ A _ _ E
- The letters R, I, S are not in the word at all.

We need to make a second guess that is a 5-letter English word, with the second letter A and the fifth letter E, and without using R, I, S.

We also know that the word must have the pattern: [letter1] A [letter3] [letter4] E

So avoid S.

Another word: ""LATTE"" - L A T T E -> but the fifth letter is E? ""LATTE"" ends with E? No, it ends with E? L-A-T-T-E, yes, it ends with E. But the pattern is _ A _ _ E, so L A T T E: second letter A, fifth letter E. And no R, I, S? L, A, T, T, E -> no R, I, S. But it has double T, which might be good to test T.

But ""LATTE"" is a valid word.

So for ""PLANE"", it is P L A N E, which is not of the form _ A _ _ E because the A is in the third position, not the second.

So we need words where A is the second letter.

But let's confirm: T A B L E -> positions: 1:T, 2:A (correct), 3:B, 4:L, 5:E (correct). And no R, I, S.

Yes.

We can then see the feedback to narrow down.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, I, and S are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- A is in the correct position (second letter, marked with ""✓"").
- E is in the correct position (fifth letter, marked with ""✓"").

This means the secret word has the pattern: `_ A _ _ E`, and it does not contain R, I, or S. For the second guess:
- The word must have ""A"" as the second letter and ""E"" as the fifth letter.
- It should avoid using R, I, or S to test new letters.
- Common letters like T, B, L, N, C, O, etc., are good candidates to maximize information.

After considering options like ""DANCE"" (tests D, N, C), ""CANOE"" (tests C, N, O), and ""MAPLE"" (tests M, P, L), ""TABLE"" is chosen because:
- It fits the pattern `_ A _ _ E` (T A B L E).
- It tests three new common consonants (T, B, L) in positions 1, 3, and 4.
- It avoids eliminated letters (R, I, S).

This guess will help identify if T, B, or L are in the word and their positions, narrowing down possibilities for the next guess.",Guess 2: TABLE -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) A(✓) B(✓) L(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
