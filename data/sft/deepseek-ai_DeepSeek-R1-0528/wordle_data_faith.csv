First, I need to make my first guess for a 5-letter word. Since I have no prior information, I should choose a word that maximizes the potential information gain. That means picking a word with common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to cover as much ground as possible.

In Wordle, good starting words often include multiple vowels and common consonants. For example, ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ROATE"" are frequently used because they cover frequent letters.

Let me recall the English letter frequencies. According to general English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc. So, incorporating these might increase the chances of hitting some letters in the secret word.

Aim for at least two vowels and three consonants. Vowels are A, E, I, O, U (sometimes Y, but let's stick to common ones).

Let's list some candidate starters:

- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E – has A and E (vowels), and common consonants R, N, C.

- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E – S, L, T are common consonants, A and E vowels.

- ROATE: R, O, A, T, E – similar to above.

- AUDIO: A, U, D, I, O – that's four vowels! But U and D are less common; might not be ideal for covering consonants.

Perhaps I should avoid words with repeated letters for the first guess, since each letter should be unique to test different positions.

Repeated letters might reduce information, but in Wordle, words can have repeated letters, but for the first guess, it's better to have all unique letters.

So words like ""BOOKS"" have repeated O, so not great for first guess.

Better options: ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""PILOT"", ""ADIEU"" (which has A, D, I, E, U – lots of vowels, but D might not be super common).

""RAISE"" is another popular one: R, A, I, S, E – that's good; R, A, I, S, E all common letters.

Similarly, ""IRATE"": I, R, A, T, E.

I think ""CRANE"" or ""RAISE"" are solid choices.

But let's confirm with my knowledge: In Wordle strategies, ""CRANE"" and ""SLATE"" are often recommended.

Since this is the first guess, any reasonable word should be fine. I just need to pick one.

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess.

So, my guess is ""CRANE"".

<thinking>
For the first guess, I have no prior information about the secret word. Therefore, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain by including common English letters. This increases the likelihood of matching letters and provides useful feedback for subsequent guesses. Based on letter frequency data, the most common letters in English 5-letter words are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, and C. 

A good starting word should:
- Contain a mix of vowels and consonants to cover different possibilities.
- Avoid repeated letters to test more unique characters.
- Be a valid 5-letter word.

Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""RAISE"" are commonly used in games like Wordle for this purpose. After considering:
- ""CRANE"" includes C, R, A, N, E, which covers three common consonants and two vowels (A and E).
- It has no repeated letters.
- Compared to alternatives, ""CRANE"" is a high-frequency starter that often yields balanced feedback.

Thus, I will start with ""CRANE"" to gather initial clues.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
C(x) - C is not in the word
R(x) - R is not in the word
A(-) - A is in the word but in the wrong position
N(x) - N is not in the word
E(x) - E is not in the word

So, from this, we know:
- The letter A is present in the secret word, but not in the second position (since in ""crane"", A is the third letter, and it's marked as wrong position).
- The letters C, R, N, E are absent from the secret word.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, but not in the third position. Also, it does not contain C, R, N, or E.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Includes the letter A (since we know it's in the word) and places it in a different position than the third (to test where it might be).
- Avoids the letters C, R, N, E (since they are not in the word).
- Uses other common letters to maximize the chance of getting more information.

Possible positions for A: It can be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since position 3 is wrong, and we know it's present).

We also know that the word has 5 letters and we have 5 more guesses (since we used one).

We should consider other common letters that are not yet tested. The most common letters in English that we haven't tried are: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

We should form a word that has A in a new position and includes some of these untested common letters.

Let's think of words that have A and avoid C, R, N, E.

For example:
- A in the first position: words like ""ABOUT"", ""ABOVE"", ""AFTER"", etc. But we must avoid R and E? ""ABOUT"" has no R or E? ""ABOUT"": A, B, O, U, T. But we don't know about B, O, U, T yet. Also, note that we must avoid R, but R is not in ""about"". Similarly, avoid E? ""about"" has no E. But we have to avoid C, R, N, E. So ""about"" is okay? Let's check: A, B, O, U, T. None of these are C, R, N, E. So it's a candidate.

- A in the second position: words like ""PASTA"", but that has S and T, but also P and A. However, ""pasta"" has two A's? We don't know if the word has repeated letters, but for now, we can avoid repeats to get more information. So maybe ""PAINT"" but that has N? N is not allowed (we know N is absent). So we must avoid N. ""PAINT"" has N -> invalid because N is not in the word. How about ""PATCH""? But C is not allowed. We must avoid C. So ""PATCH"" has C -> invalid. ""LATCH"" also has C. So let's think: ""SAULT""? Not a word. ""HALTS"": H, A, L, T, S. A is in second position. And H, L, T, S are new. And no C, R, N, E. So ""halts"" is a word? Yes, meaning to stop.

- A in the fourth position: words like ""PLANT"" but has N -> invalid. ""BLAST"" has S, T, and A in fourth? B, L, A, S, T -> A is the third? Let's count: B(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), T(5). So A is in third, but we already know A is not in third? In the first guess, A was in third and it was wrong position, so in the secret word, A is not in third. So we can try A in fourth? For example, ""FOCAL"" but has C and O? F, O, C, A, L -> C is not allowed. ""TONAL"" has T, O, N, A, L -> N is not allowed. ""VOCAL"" has C. So hard. ""MANIA"" has M, A, N, I, A -> has N and repeated A. Not good. ""DELTA"" has E and D? E is not allowed. So perhaps avoid fourth position for now.

- A in the fifth position: words like ""PIZZA"" but has Z and repeated Z. Not common. ""AROMA"" has A at first and fifth? But we don't know about first. Also, has R? R is not allowed. ""AROMA"" has R -> invalid. ""ULTRA"" has U, L, T, R, A -> R is not allowed. ""EXTRA"" has E, X, T, R, A -> E and R not allowed. So fifth position might be tricky.

Given the above, it might be easier to try A in the first or second position.

Let me list some candidate words:

1. With A in first position: 
   - ABOUT: A, B, O, U, T -> avoids C,R,N,E. Good.
   - ABOVE: A, B, O, V, E -> but E is not allowed? E is absent, so we cannot use E. So invalid.
   - AFTER: A, F, T, E, R -> has E and R -> invalid.
   - ADAPT: A, D, A, P, T -> repeated A? And we don't know if repeated letters are there, but it's valid. But we have A twice, which might not be efficient. Also, D, P, T are new.
   - ADMIT: A, D, M, I, T -> avoids C,R,N,E. Good.

2. With A in second position:
   - SALTS: S, A, L, T, S -> repeated S? Not ideal.
   - HALTS: H, A, L, T, S -> as I thought earlier. Valid word, and letters H, L, T, S are new and common.
   - BALMY: B, A, L, M, Y -> avoids C,R,N,E. Y is less common, but possible.
   - PALSY: P, A, L, S, Y -> similar.

3. With A in fourth position: hard to find without forbidden letters. For example, ""FATAL"" has A in fourth? F(1), A(2), T(3), A(4), L(5) -> A in second and fourth. Repeated. ""OVALS"" has O, V, A, L, S -> A in third? O(1), V(2), A(3), L(4), S(5) -> A in third, but we know A is not in third. So we need A in fourth. ""LOCAL"" has C -> invalid. ""TONAL"" has N -> invalid. ""DIVAN"" has N -> invalid. So maybe skip.

4. With A in fifth: ""MANGA"" has N and repeated A. ""VISTA"" has S, T, A at fifth: V, I, S, T, A -> avoids C,R,N,E. V and I are new. So ""vista"" is a candidate.

So possible candidates: ABOUT, ADMIT, HALTS, BALMY, PALSY, VISTA.

We want to maximize new information. So we should include as many new common letters as possible.

Common letters left: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

Comparing the candidates:
- ABOUT: A, B, O, U, T -> letters: B, O, U, T (and A). Common letters: O, T, U, B (B is less common).
- ADMIT: A, D, M, I, T -> D, M, I, T. I and T are common.
- HALTS: H, A, L, T, S -> H, L, T, S. S, T, L are very common; H is common too.
- BALMY: B, A, L, M, Y -> B, L, M, Y. L is common, M and B medium, Y less common.
- PALSY: P, A, L, S, Y -> P, L, S, Y. S and L common, P medium, Y less common.
- VISTA: V, I, S, T, A -> V, I, S, T. S and T common, I common, V less common.

HALTS seems very good because it has S, T, L which are high frequency, and H is also common. Also, it places A in the second position, which we haven't tested.

ABOUT has O and T, but B and U are less common? U is medium. But HALTS covers more common consonants.

ADMIT has I and T, and D and M.

But HALTS has S and L, which are very common.

Moreover, in HALTS, we have A in second position, which is a new position.

So I think HALTS is a strong candidate.

Another word: ""SHALT"" is similar to HALTS but with S first. But ""SHALT"" is a word? Yes, archaic for ""shall"". But in Wordle, it might be accepted. However, HALTS is more common.

To be safe, let's use HALTS.

But note: in the first guess, we had A in third position and it was wrong. Now we are trying A in second. If in HALTS, A is marked as correct, then we know it's in second position. If it's marked as wrong position again, then we know A is not in second or third, so it must be in first, fourth, or fifth.

Also, by using HALTS, we test H, A, L, T, S.

So I'll go with HALTS.

But let me confirm: the word must be valid. HALTS is a valid English word.

Also, it doesn't use any forbidden letters (C, R, N, E).

Therefore, my second guess is ""halts"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, N, and E are **not** in the secret word.
- A is in the word but **not in the third position**.

For the second guess:
- I must include A (since it is confirmed present) but avoid positions where it might be incorrect. Since it was wrong in position 3, I'll try it in position 2 to test a new location.
- I must avoid C, R, N, and E entirely.
- I should prioritize common unused letters (e.g., S, T, L, O, I, H) to maximize information gain.
- ""HALTS"" is a strong choice: 
  - It places A in position 2 (new position to test).
  - It uses new high-frequency letters: H, L, T, S.
  - It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, N, E) and has no repeats.

This guess will help narrow down the position of A and reveal if any of H, L, T, or S are present.

<guess>halts</guess>",halts,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
C(x) - C is not in the word
R(x) - R is not in the word
A(-) - A is in the word but in the wrong position
N(x) - N is not in the word
E(x) - E is not in the word

So, from this, we know:
- The letter A is present in the secret word, but not in the second position (since in ""crane"", A is the third letter, and it's marked as wrong position).
- The letters C, R, N, E are absent from the secret word.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, but not in the third position. Also, it does not contain C, R, N, or E.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Includes the letter A (since we know it's in the word) and places it in a different position than the third (to test where it might be).
- Avoids the letters C, R, N, E (since they are not in the word).
- Uses other common letters to maximize the chance of getting more information.

Possible positions for A: It can be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since position 3 is wrong, and we know it's present).

We also know that the word has 5 letters and we have 5 more guesses (since we used one).

We should consider other common letters that are not yet tested. The most common letters in English that we haven't tried are: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

We should form a word that has A in a new position and includes some of these untested common letters.

Let's think of words that have A and avoid C, R, N, E.

For example:
- A in the first position: words like ""ABOUT"", ""ABOVE"", ""AFTER"", etc. But we must avoid R and E? ""ABOUT"" has no R or E? ""ABOUT"": A, B, O, U, T. But we don't know about B, O, U, T yet. Also, note that we must avoid R, but R is not in ""about"". Similarly, avoid E? ""about"" has no E. But we have to avoid C, R, N, E. So ""about"" is okay? Let's check: A, B, O, U, T. None of these are C, R, N, E. So it's a candidate.

- A in the second position: words like ""PASTA"", but that has S and T, but also P and A. However, ""pasta"" has two A's? We don't know if the word has repeated letters, but for now, we can avoid repeats to get more information. So maybe ""PAINT"" but that has N? N is not allowed (we know N is absent). So we must avoid N. ""PAINT"" has N -> invalid because N is not in the word. How about ""PATCH""? But C is not allowed. We must avoid C. So ""PATCH"" has C -> invalid. ""LATCH"" also has C. So let's think: ""SAULT""? Not a word. ""HALTS"": H, A, L, T, S. A is in second position. And H, L, T, S are new. And no C, R, N, E. So ""halts"" is a word? Yes, meaning to stop.

- A in the fourth position: words like ""PLANT"" but has N -> invalid. ""BLAST"" has S, T, and A in fourth? B, L, A, S, T -> A is the third? Let's count: B(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), T(5). So A is in third, but we already know A is not in third? In the first guess, A was in third and it was wrong position, so in the secret word, A is not in third. So we can try A in fourth? For example, ""FOCAL"" but has C and O? F, O, C, A, L -> C is not allowed. ""TONAL"" has T, O, N, A, L -> N is not allowed. ""VOCAL"" has C. So hard. ""MANIA"" has M, A, N, I, A -> has N and repeated A. Not good. ""DELTA"" has E and D? E is not allowed. So perhaps avoid fourth position for now.

- A in the fifth position: words like ""PIZZA"" but has Z and repeated Z. Not common. ""AROMA"" has A at first and fifth? But we don't know about first. Also, has R? R is not allowed. ""AROMA"" has R -> invalid. ""ULTRA"" has U, L, T, R, A -> R is not allowed. ""EXTRA"" has E, X, T, R, A -> E and R not allowed. So fifth position might be tricky.

Given the above, it might be easier to try A in the first or second position.

Let me list some candidate words:

1. With A in first position: 
   - ABOUT: A, B, O, U, T -> avoids C,R,N,E. Good.
   - ABOVE: A, B, O, V, E -> but E is not allowed? E is absent, so we cannot use E. So invalid.
   - AFTER: A, F, T, E, R -> has E and R -> invalid.
   - ADAPT: A, D, A, P, T -> repeated A? And we don't know if repeated letters are there, but it's valid. But we have A twice, which might not be efficient. Also, D, P, T are new.
   - ADMIT: A, D, M, I, T -> avoids C,R,N,E. Good.

2. With A in second position:
   - SALTS: S, A, L, T, S -> repeated S? Not ideal.
   - HALTS: H, A, L, T, S -> as I thought earlier. Valid word, and letters H, L, T, S are new and common.
   - BALMY: B, A, L, M, Y -> avoids C,R,N,E. Y is less common, but possible.
   - PALSY: P, A, L, S, Y -> similar.

3. With A in fourth position: hard to find without forbidden letters. For example, ""FATAL"" has A in fourth? F(1), A(2), T(3), A(4), L(5) -> A in second and fourth. Repeated. ""OVALS"" has O, V, A, L, S -> A in third? O(1), V(2), A(3), L(4), S(5) -> A in third, but we know A is not in third. So we need A in fourth. ""LOCAL"" has C -> invalid. ""TONAL"" has N -> invalid. ""DIVAN"" has N -> invalid. So maybe skip.

4. With A in fifth: ""MANGA"" has N and repeated A. ""VISTA"" has S, T, A at fifth: V, I, S, T, A -> avoids C,R,N,E. V and I are new. So ""vista"" is a candidate.

So possible candidates: ABOUT, ADMIT, HALTS, BALMY, PALSY, VISTA.

We want to maximize new information. So we should include as many new common letters as possible.

Common letters left: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

Comparing the candidates:
- ABOUT: A, B, O, U, T -> letters: B, O, U, T (and A). Common letters: O, T, U, B (B is less common).
- ADMIT: A, D, M, I, T -> D, M, I, T. I and T are common.
- HALTS: H, A, L, T, S -> H, L, T, S. S, T, L are very common; H is common too.
- BALMY: B, A, L, M, Y -> B, L, M, Y. L is common, M and B medium, Y less common.
- PALSY: P, A, L, S, Y -> P, L, S, Y. S and L common, P medium, Y less common.
- VISTA: V, I, S, T, A -> V, I, S, T. S and T common, I common, V less common.

HALTS seems very good because it has S, T, L which are high frequency, and H is also common. Also, it places A in the second position, which we haven't tested.

ABOUT has O and T, but B and U are less common? U is medium. But HALTS covers more common consonants.

ADMIT has I and T, and D and M.

But HALTS has S and L, which are very common.

Moreover, in HALTS, we have A in second position, which is a new position.

So I think HALTS is a strong candidate.

Another word: ""SHALT"" is similar to HALTS but with S first. But ""SHALT"" is a word? Yes, archaic for ""shall"". But in Wordle, it might be accepted. However, HALTS is more common.

To be safe, let's use HALTS.

But note: in the first guess, we had A in third position and it was wrong. Now we are trying A in second. If in HALTS, A is marked as correct, then we know it's in second position. If it's marked as wrong position again, then we know A is not in second or third, so it must be in first, fourth, or fifth.

Also, by using HALTS, we test H, A, L, T, S.

So I'll go with HALTS.

But let me confirm: the word must be valid. HALTS is a valid English word.

Also, it doesn't use any forbidden letters (C, R, N, E).

Therefore, my second guess is ""halts"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, N, and E are **not** in the secret word.
- A is in the word but **not in the third position**.

For the second guess:
- I must include A (since it is confirmed present) but avoid positions where it might be incorrect. Since it was wrong in position 3, I'll try it in position 2 to test a new location.
- I must avoid C, R, N, and E entirely.
- I should prioritize common unused letters (e.g., S, T, L, O, I, H) to maximize information gain.
- ""HALTS"" is a strong choice: 
  - It places A in position 2 (new position to test).
  - It uses new high-frequency letters: H, L, T, S.
  - It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, N, E) and has no repeats.

This guess will help narrow down the position of A and reveal if any of H, L, T, or S are present.",Guess 2: halts -> FEEDBACK: H(-) A(✓) L(x) T(✓) S(x),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>First, I need to make my first guess for a 5-letter word. Since I have no prior information, I should choose a word that maximizes the potential information gain. That means picking a word with common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to cover as much ground as possible.

In Wordle, good starting words often include multiple vowels and common consonants. For example, ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ROATE"" are frequently used because they cover frequent letters.

Let me recall the English letter frequencies. According to general English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc. So, incorporating these might increase the chances of hitting some letters in the secret word.

Aim for at least two vowels and three consonants. Vowels are A, E, I, O, U (sometimes Y, but let's stick to common ones).

Let's list some candidate starters:

- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E – has A and E (vowels), and common consonants R, N, C.

- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E – S, L, T are common consonants, A and E vowels.

- ROATE: R, O, A, T, E – similar to above.

- AUDIO: A, U, D, I, O – that's four vowels! But U and D are less common; might not be ideal for covering consonants.

Perhaps I should avoid words with repeated letters for the first guess, since each letter should be unique to test different positions.

Repeated letters might reduce information, but in Wordle, words can have repeated letters, but for the first guess, it's better to have all unique letters.

So words like ""BOOKS"" have repeated O, so not great for first guess.

Better options: ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""PILOT"", ""ADIEU"" (which has A, D, I, E, U – lots of vowels, but D might not be super common).

""RAISE"" is another popular one: R, A, I, S, E – that's good; R, A, I, S, E all common letters.

Similarly, ""IRATE"": I, R, A, T, E.

I think ""CRANE"" or ""RAISE"" are solid choices.

But let's confirm with my knowledge: In Wordle strategies, ""CRANE"" and ""SLATE"" are often recommended.

Since this is the first guess, any reasonable word should be fine. I just need to pick one.

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess.

So, my guess is ""CRANE"".<thinking>
For the first guess, I have no prior information about the secret word. Therefore, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain by including common English letters. This increases the likelihood of matching letters and provides useful feedback for subsequent guesses. Based on letter frequency data, the most common letters in English 5-letter words are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, and C. 

A good starting word should:
- Contain a mix of vowels and consonants to cover different possibilities.
- Avoid repeated letters to test more unique characters.
- Be a valid 5-letter word.

Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""RAISE"" are commonly used in games like Wordle for this purpose. After considering:
- ""CRANE"" includes C, R, A, N, E, which covers three common consonants and two vowels (A and E).
- It has no repeated letters.
- Compared to alternatives, ""CRANE"" is a high-frequency starter that often yields balanced feedback.

Thus, I will start with ""CRANE"" to gather initial clues.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
C(x) - C is not in the word
R(x) - R is not in the word
A(-) - A is in the word but in the wrong position
N(x) - N is not in the word
E(x) - E is not in the word

So, from this, we know:
- The letter A is present in the secret word, but not in the second position (since in ""crane"", A is the third letter, and it's marked as wrong position).
- The letters C, R, N, E are absent from the secret word.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, but not in the third position. Also, it does not contain C, R, N, or E.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Includes the letter A (since we know it's in the word) and places it in a different position than the third (to test where it might be).
- Avoids the letters C, R, N, E (since they are not in the word).
- Uses other common letters to maximize the chance of getting more information.

Possible positions for A: It can be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since position 3 is wrong, and we know it's present).

We also know that the word has 5 letters and we have 5 more guesses (since we used one).

We should consider other common letters that are not yet tested. The most common letters in English that we haven't tried are: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

We should form a word that has A in a new position and includes some of these untested common letters.

Let's think of words that have A and avoid C, R, N, E.

For example:
- A in the first position: words like ""ABOUT"", ""ABOVE"", ""AFTER"", etc. But we must avoid R and E? ""ABOUT"" has no R or E? ""ABOUT"": A, B, O, U, T. But we don't know about B, O, U, T yet. Also, note that we must avoid R, but R is not in ""about"". Similarly, avoid E? ""about"" has no E. But we have to avoid C, R, N, E. So ""about"" is okay? Let's check: A, B, O, U, T.

- A in the second position: words like ""PASTA"", but that has S and T, but also P and A. However, ""pasta"" has two A's? We don't know if the word has repeated letters, but for now, we can avoid repeats to get more information. So maybe ""PAINT"" but that has N? N is not allowed (we know N is absent). So we must avoid N. ""PAINT"" has N -> invalid because N is not in the word. How about ""PATCH""? But C is not allowed. We must avoid C. So ""PATCH"" has C -> invalid. ""LATCH"" also has C. So let's think: ""SAULT""? Not a word. ""HALTS"": H, A, L, T, S. A is in second position. And H, L, T, S are new. And no C, R, N, E. So ""halts"" is a word? Yes, meaning to stop.

- A in the fourth position: words like ""PLANT"" but has N -> invalid. ""BLAST"" has S, T, and A in fourth? B, L, A, S, T -> A is the third? Let's count: B(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), T(5). So A is in third, but we already know A is not in third? In the first guess, A was in third and it was wrong position, so in the secret word, A is not in third. So we can try A in fourth?

3. With A in fourth position: hard to find without forbidden letters. For example, ""FATAL"" has A in fourth? F(1), A(2), T(3), A(4), L(5) -> A in second and fourth. Repeated.

So it\'s a candidate.\n\n- A in the second position: words like ""PASTA"", but that has S and T, but also P and A. However, ""pasta"" has two A\'s? We don\'t know if the word has repeated letters, but for now, we can avoid repeats to get more information. So maybe ""PAINT"" but that has N? N is not allowed (we know N is absent). So we must avoid N. ""PAINT"" has N -> invalid because N is not in the word. How about ""PATCH""? But C is not allowed. We must avoid C. So ""PATCH"" has C -> invalid. ""LATCH"" also has C. So let\'s think: ""SAULT""? Not a word. ""HALTS"": H, A, L, T, S. A is in second position. And H, L, T, S are new. And no C, R, N, E. So ""halts"" is a word? Yes, meaning to stop.\n\n- A in the fourth position: words like ""PLANT"" but has N -> invalid. ""BLAST"" has S, T, and A in fourth? B, L, A, S, T -> A is the third? Let\'s count: B(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), T(5). So A is in third, but we already know A is not in third? In the first guess, A was in third and it was wrong position, so in the secret word, A is not in third. So we can try A in fourth? For example, ""FOCAL"" but has C and O? F, O, C, A, L -> C is not allowed. ""TONAL"" has T, O, N, A, L -> N is not allowed. ""VOCAL"" has C. So hard. ""MANIA"" has M, A, N, I, A -> has N and repeated A. Not good. ""DELTA"" has E and D? E is not allowed. So perhaps avoid fourth position for now.\n\n- A in the fifth position: words like ""PIZZA"" but has Z and repeated Z. Not common. ""AROMA"" has A at first and fifth? But we don\'t know about first. Also, has R? R is not allowed. ""AROMA"" has R -> invalid. ""ULTRA"" has U, L, T, R, A -> R is not allowed. ""EXTRA"" has E, X, T, R, A -> E and R not allowed. So fifth position might be tricky.\n\nGiven the above, it might be easier to try A in the first or second position.\n\nLet me list some candidate words:\n\n1. With A in first position: \n   - ABOUT: A, B, O, U, T -> avoids C,R,N,E. Good.\n   - ABOVE: A, B, O, V, E -> but E is not allowed? E is absent, so we cannot use E. So invalid.\n   - AFTER: A, F, T, E, R -> has E and R -> invalid.\n   - ADAPT: A, D, A, P, T -> repeated A? And we don\'t know if repeated letters are there, but it\'s valid. But we have A twice, which might not be efficient. Also, D, P, T are new.\n   - ADMIT: A, D, M, I, T -> avoids C,R,N,E. Good.\n\n2. With A in second position:\n   - SALTS: S, A, L, T, S -> repeated S? Not ideal.\n   - HALTS: H, A, L, T, S -> as I thought earlier. Valid word, and letters H, L, T, S are new and common.\n   - BALMY: B, A, L, M, Y -> avoids C,R,N,E. Y is less common, but possible.\n   - PALSY: P, A, L, S, Y -> similar.\n\n3. With A in fourth position: hard to find without forbidden letters. For example, ""FATAL"" has A in fourth? F(1), A(2), T(3), A(4), L(5) -> A in second and fourth. Repeated. ""OVALS"" has O, V, A, L, S -> A in third? O(1), V(2), A(3), L(4), S(5) -> A in third, but we know A is not in third. So we need A in fourth. ""LOCAL"" has C -> invalid. ""TONAL"" has N -> invalid. ""DIVAN"" has N -> invalid. So maybe skip.\n\n4. With A in fifth: ""MANGA"" has N and repeated A. ""VISTA"" has S, T, A at fifth: V, I, S, T, A -> avoids C,R,N,E. V and I are new. So ""vista"" is a candidate.\n\nSo possible candidates: ABOUT, ADMIT, HALTS, BALMY, PALSY, VISTA.\n\nWe want to maximize new information. So we should include as many new common letters as possible.\n\nCommon letters left: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.\n\nComparing the candidates:\n- ABOUT: A, B, O, U, T -> letters: B, O, U, T (and A). Common letters: O, T, U, B (B is less common).\n- ADMIT: A, D, M, I, T -> D, M, I, T. I and T are common.\n- HALTS: H, A, L, T, S -> H, L, T, S. S, T, L are very common; H is common too.\n- BALMY: B, A, L, M, Y -> B, L, M, Y. L is common, M and B medium, Y less common.\n- PALSY: P, A, L, S, Y -> P, L, S, Y. S and L common, P medium, Y less common.\n- VISTA: V, I, S, T, A -> V, I, S, T. S and T common, I common, V less common.\n\nHALTS seems very good because it has S, T, L which are high frequency, and H is also common. Also, it places A in the second position, which we haven\'t tested.\n\nABOUT has O and T, but B and U are less common? U is medium. But HALTS covers more common consonants.\n\nADMIT has I and T, and D and M.\n\nBut HALTS has S and L, which are very common.\n\nMoreover, in HALTS, we have A in second position, which is a new position.\n\nSo I think HALTS is a strong candidate.\n\nAnother word: ""SHALT"" is similar to HALTS but with S first. But ""SHALT"" is a word? Yes, archaic for ""shall"". But in Wordle, it might be accepted. However, HALTS is more common.\n\nTo be safe, let\'s use HALTS.\n\nBut note: in the first guess, we had A in third position and it was wrong. Now we are trying A in second. If in HALTS, A is marked as correct, then we know it\'s in second position. If it\'s marked as wrong position again, then we know A is not in second or third, so it must be in first, fourth, or fifth.\n\nAlso, by using HALTS, we test H, A, L, T, S.\n\nSo I\'ll go with HALTS.\n\nBut let me confirm: the word must be valid. HALTS is a valid English word.\n\nAlso, it doesn\'t use any forbidden letters (C, R, N, E).\n\nTherefore, my second guess is ""halts"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, N, and E are **not** in the secret word.\n- A is in the word but **not in the third position**.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- I must include A (since it is confirmed present) but avoid positions where it might be incorrect. Since it was wrong in position 3, I\'ll try it in position 2 to test a new location.\n- I must avoid C, R, N, and E entirely.\n- I should prioritize common unused letters (e.g., S, T, L, O, I, H) to maximize information gain.\n- ""HALTS"" is a strong choice: \n  - It places A in position 2 (new position to test).\n  - It uses new high-frequency letters: H, L, T, S.\n  - It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, N, E) and has no repeats.\n\nThis guess will help narrow down the position of A and reveal if any of H, L, T, or S are present.\n\n<guess>halts</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: halts -> FEEDBACK: H(-) A(✓) L(x) T(✓) S(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- C, R, N, E are absent from the secret word.
- A is present but not in position 3.

Guess 2: ""halts"" -> H(-), A(✓), L(x), T(✓), S(x)
Meaning:
- A is correct and in position 2 (since it was marked correct in ""halts"" which has A in position 2).
- T is correct and in position 4 (since T is the 4th letter in ""halts"" and marked correct).
- H is present but not in position 1 (since marked as wrong position).
- L and S are absent.

So, from both guesses, we know:

- The secret word has A in position 2 and T in position 4.
- The secret word contains H, but not in position 1 (and since it's present, it must be in position 3 or 5, because position 2 is A and position 4 is T).
- Absent letters: C, R, N, E, L, S.

Also, from the first guess, we know A is not in position 3, which is consistent because now we have A in position 2.

Now, the secret word structure so far:
Position 1: unknown, but not C, R, N, E, L, S, and not H? H is present but not in position 1, so position 1 is open and must be a letter not in the absent list.
Position 2: A (fixed)
Position 3: unknown, but could be H? Or another letter. Since H is present and not in position 1, it could be in 3 or 5.
Position 4: T (fixed)
Position 5: unknown, but could be H? Or another letter.

We also know the word must contain H, so it must appear in position 3 or 5.

Now, we need to make a third guess. We should:
- Include H in either position 3 or 5 (to test which one, or if it's in both, but we don't know if there are duplicates, but since we haven't seen duplicates, we can assume one H for now).
- Avoid the absent letters: C, R, N, E, L, S.
- Use other common letters to test: for example, O, I, D, U, M, P, B, etc.

Let's list possible letters for the unknown positions: position 1, 3, and 5.

Position 1: cannot be C, R, N, E, L, S, and also cannot be A (since A is in 2) or T (in 4). So available: B, D, G, H? But H is present, but we don't know if it can be in position 1? But from feedback, H is not in position 1, so position 1 cannot be H. Similarly, position 1 cannot be any of the absent letters. So possible: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we should focus on common letters.

Position 3: could be H or other letters. But we know H must be in the word, so if position 3 is not H, then position 5 must be H. Or if position 3 is H, then position 5 is something else.

Position 5: similarly.

We can design a guess to test H in position 3 or 5.

Also, we need to fill position 1 with a common letter.

Let me think of words that have A in position 2, T in position 4, and H in either position 3 or 5, and avoid C,R,N,E,L,S.

First, if H is in position 3: then the word would be _ A H T _
Possible words: for example, ""DAHTY"" not a word. ""FAITH"" but has I and H, but let's see: F(1), A(2), I(3)? But we are putting H in 3? No, if H is in 3, then position 3 is H, so ""FAHT?"" not a word. Actually, common words: ""FAITH"" is F, A, I, T, H -> so position 3 is I, not H. We need position 3 to be H. Words like ""MAHAT"" not a word. ""BAHT"" is 4 letters. Not many common words with _ A H T _

What about ""YACHT"" but Y(1), A(2), C(3)? C is absent, and also position 3 is C, not H. Not good.

Perhaps H in position 3 is rare. Let's think of words ending with T and having A in second and T in fourth.

Another idea: if H is in position 5, then the word is _ A _ T H

For example: ""DEATH"" but D, E, A, T, H -> E is absent, so invalid.
""HEATH"" has H in first and E, but E absent and H in first is not allowed (from feedback, H not in position 1).
""PATH"" is 4 letters.
""BATHS"" but S is absent.
""LATHS"" has L and S absent.
""OATHS"" has O, A, T, H, S -> S absent.

But we need a word without E, and without S, L, etc.

What about ""MATCH""? But C is absent.

Perhaps ""PATCH"" but C absent.

This is tricky. Maybe H is not in position 5? But it must be somewhere.

Another possibility: the word might have H in position 3, but we need a valid word.

List of words with pattern _ A _ T _ and containing H, and avoiding C,R,N,E,L,S.

Since we know H is present, and positions: 2 is A, 4 is T.

So the word: pos1, A, pos3, T, pos5.

And H must be in pos3 or pos5.

Also, the word must be 5 letters.

Possible words:

- If H in pos3: then _ A H T _
  - Possible: ""DAHTS"" not a word. ""LAHTS"" not a word. ""MAHTS"" not a word. ""PAHTS"" not a word. ""RAHTS"" not a word. ""WAHTS"" not a word. I can't think of any common English word with this pattern. So probably H is not in position 3.

- Therefore, H must be in position 5. So the word is _ A _ T H

Now, we need words of the form _ A _ T H, avoiding C,R,N,E,L,S.

Common words:
- ""BATH"" is 4 letters.
- ""PATH"" 4 letters.
- ""MATH"" 4 letters.
- 5-letter words: ""DEATH"" has E -> absent, invalid.
- ""HEATH"" has E -> invalid.
- ""NEATH"" has N and E -> invalid.
- ""WATTH"" not a word.
- ""LATHE"" has L and E -> invalid.
- ""BATHE"" has E -> invalid.
- ""HATHA"" not common, and H in first? But H not in position 1.

What about ""YACHT""? But that has C and no H at the end.

Perhaps ""PITHA"" not a word.

I need to think of other words. Maybe ""DATOH"" not a word.

Another idea: perhaps ""FAITH"" but that is F,A,I,T,H -> so position 3 is I, not H. But H is at the end. So for ""FAITH"", it is _ A _ T H with H in position 5.

And ""FAITH"" has F, A, I, T, H.

Now, check the absent letters: C,R,N,E,L,S are absent. F, I, T, H: T is already known, F and I are new, and H is present.

T is already confirmed, so we don't need to test T again.

In ""FAITH"", the letters are F, A, I, T, H.

A and T are already known positions, so we are testing F, I, and H (position 5).

But H is present, so if we put H in position 5, we can confirm if it is correct there.

Similarly, I is a new letter.

But is ""FAITH"" valid? Yes.

Another word: ""GAITH"" not a word.

""HAITH"" not common.

""WAIFT"" not a word.

""BAITH"" not a word.

""MAIST"" has S and T, but S is absent.

So ""FAITH"" seems a candidate.

But we have to avoid E, which we do.

Another word: ""DAINT"" but N is absent.

""TAWTH"" not a word.

So ""FAITH"" might be a good guess.

But let's see the pattern: if the secret word is _ A _ T H, and we guess ""FAITH"", which is F A I T H.

If the secret word has H in position 5, then in ""FAITH"", H is in position 5, so it should be marked correct if that's the case.

Similarly, we can test if I is in the word.

But we don't know if I is present or not.

Another candidate: ""PATIO"" but that has P,A,T,I,O -> but T is in position 3? P(1), A(2), T(3), I(4), O(5). But we need T in position 4, not 3. So not matching.

We need T in position 4.

So back to ""FAITH"": F(1), A(2), I(3), T(4), H(5)

This matches the pattern: position 2 is A, position 4 is T, and we are testing H in position 5.

Also, it uses F and I, which are new.

We could test H in position 3 with a different word, but we couldn't find one, so likely H is in position 5.

Perhaps ""BATCH"" but C is absent.

So I think ""FAITH"" is a reasonable guess.

But let's think of other options.

What about ""DUTCH""? But C absent.

""POTCH"" has C.

""MITCH"" has C.

Another word: ""WIGHT"" but has G and H, but W(1), I(2), G(3), H(4), T(5) -> but we need A in position 2 and T in position 4, so not.

We must have A in 2 and T in 4.

So the only pattern is _ A ? T H

And ? is the third letter, which can be various.

In ""FAITH"", ? is I.

Other possibilities: ""MAITH"" not a word.

""PAITH"" not a word.

""RAITH"" not a word.

""TAITH"" not a word.

""BAITH"" not a word.

""GAITH"" not a word.

""HAITH"" not standard.

""JAITH"" not a word.

""KAITH"" not a word.

""LAITH"" is a word? I think ""laith"" is an obsolete word for barn, but not common. And L is absent? L is absent, so we cannot use L.

L is absent, so no.

""QAITH"" not a word.

""VAITH"" not a word.

""WAITH"" not a word.

""XAITH"" not.

So ""FAITH"" seems the most common word that fits.

Another one: ""EYRTH"" not a word.

So I think ""FAITH"" is a good choice.

But we have to consider that if H is in position 5, then in ""FAITH"", H should be correct, and we can confirm.

If not, then we have a problem, but from feedback, H must be in the word, so position 5 is the only option left.

Position 3 we couldn't find a word, so likely position 5.

Therefore, I'll go with ""FAITH"".

But let's double-check the feedback.

We know:
- A in position 2 (correct)
- T in position 4 (correct)
- H present but not in position 1, so must be in 3 or 5.
- If we assume H in 5, then the word is _ A ? T H

In ""FAITH"", we are guessing F, A, I, T, H.

If the secret word has H in 5, then H will be correct.

If the secret word has H in 3, then in ""FAITH"", H is in 5, which would be wrong position or absent? But H is present, so if it's in position 3, then in position 5 it should be marked as wrong position (since H is in the word but not in that position).

But in our guess, we are putting H in 5 to test.

If we get H marked as correct, then we know it's in 5.

If marked as wrong position, then H must be in position 3, and we need to find a word with H in 3.

But since we couldn't find a common word with _ A H T _, it might be that H is in 5.

To be safe, we can choose a word that has H in position 5 and a common letter in position 3.

""FAITH"" uses I in position 3, which is common.

Another word: ""MOUTH"" has M, O, U, T, H -> but T is in position 4? M(1), O(2), U(3), T(4), H(5). But we need A in position 2, not O. So not.

""SOUTH"" has S, which is absent.

""ROUTH"" has R, absent.

""DOUTH"" has D, O, U, T, H -> O(2), but we need A in 2.

Not.

""TOUCH"" has C and O in 2.

No.

So ""FAITH"" seems best.

Perhaps ""PATHS"" but S absent.

I think we should go with ""FAITH"".

So third guess: ""FAITH""
</think>
### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C(absent), R(absent), A(present but wrong position), N(absent), E(absent).  
  - This means:  
    - A is in the secret word but not in position 3.  
    - C, R, N, and E are **not** in the secret word.  

- **Guess 2: ""halts""** → H(present but wrong position), A(correct position), L(absent), T(correct position), S(absent).  
  - This means:  
    - A is in the correct position (position 2).  
    - T is in the correct position (position 4).  
    - H is in the word but not in position 1.  
    - L and S are **not** in the secret word.  

### Key Insights
- **Confirmed letters and positions**:  
  - Position 2: A  
  - Position 4: T  
- **Present letter (wrong position)**:  
  - H is in the word but not in position 1. Since positions 2 and 4 are fixed (A and T), H must be in position 3 or 5.  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, L, S (these cannot appear in the word).  
- **Unknown positions**: 1, 3, and 5.  
- **Strategy for next guess**:  
  - Test H in position 5 (since position 3 is less common for H in this pattern, and no common words fit with H in position 3).  
  - Include new common letters (e.g., I, F, O, M, P) to maximize information.  
  - Avoid absent letters.  
  - The word must fit the pattern: `_ A _ T _` with H likely in position 5 (e.g., `_ A _ T H`).  

### Choosing the Next Guess
- **Ideal word**: Must include H (to test position 5), avoid absent letters, and use high-frequency unused consonants/vowels.  
- **Selected word: ""FAITH""**  
  - Fits the pattern: `F A I T H` (position 2 = A, position 4 = T, position 5 = H).  
  - Tests:  
    - H in position 5 (if correct, confirms H's position; if wrong position, H must be in position 3).  
    - New letters: F (position 1) and I (position 3), both common and untested.  
  - Avoids all absent letters (C, R, N, E, L, S).  
- **Why not other words?**  
  - Words like ""DEATH"" or ""HEATH"" contain E (absent).  
  - Words like ""PATHS"" or ""BATHS"" contain S (absent).  
  - No common words fit `_ A H T _` (H in position 3), making position 5 more likely.  

This guess will clarify the position of H and reveal if F or I are present.

<guess>faith</guess>",faith,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- C, R, N, E are absent from the secret word.
- A is present but not in position 3.

Guess 2: ""halts"" -> H(-), A(✓), L(x), T(✓), S(x)
Meaning:
- A is correct and in position 2 (since it was marked correct in ""halts"" which has A in position 2).
- T is correct and in position 4 (since T is the 4th letter in ""halts"" and marked correct).
- H is present but not in position 1 (since marked as wrong position).
- L and S are absent.

So, from both guesses, we know:

- The secret word has A in position 2 and T in position 4.
- The secret word contains H, but not in position 1 (and since it's present, it must be in position 3 or 5, because position 2 is A and position 4 is T).
- Absent letters: C, R, N, E, L, S.

Also, from the first guess, we know A is not in position 3, which is consistent because now we have A in position 2.

Now, the secret word structure so far:
Position 1: unknown, but not C, R, N, E, L, S, and not H? H is present but not in position 1, so position 1 is open and must be a letter not in the absent list.
Position 2: A (fixed)
Position 3: unknown, but could be H? Or another letter. Since H is present and not in position 1, it could be in 3 or 5.
Position 4: T (fixed)
Position 5: unknown, but could be H? Or another letter.

We also know the word must contain H, so it must appear in position 3 or 5.

Now, we need to make a third guess. We should:
- Include H in either position 3 or 5 (to test which one, or if it's in both, but we don't know if there are duplicates, but since we haven't seen duplicates, we can assume one H for now).
- Avoid the absent letters: C, R, N, E, L, S.
- Use other common letters to test: for example, O, I, D, U, M, P, B, etc.

Let's list possible letters for the unknown positions: position 1, 3, and 5.

Position 1: cannot be C, R, N, E, L, S, and also cannot be A (since A is in 2) or T (in 4). So available: B, D, G, H? But H is present, but we don't know if it can be in position 1? But from feedback, H is not in position 1, so position 1 cannot be H. Similarly, position 1 cannot be any of the absent letters. So possible: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we should focus on common letters.

Position 3: could be H or other letters. But we know H must be in the word, so if position 3 is not H, then position 5 must be H. Or if position 3 is H, then position 5 is something else.

Position 5: similarly.

We can design a guess to test H in position 3 or 5.

Also, we need to fill position 1 with a common letter.

Let me think of words that have A in position 2, T in position 4, and H in either position 3 or 5, and avoid C,R,N,E,L,S.

First, if H is in position 3: then the word would be _ A H T _
Possible words: for example, ""DAHTY"" not a word. ""FAITH"" but has I and H, but let's see: F(1), A(2), I(3)? But we are putting H in 3? No, if H is in 3, then position 3 is H, so ""FAHT?"" not a word. Actually, common words: ""FAITH"" is F, A, I, T, H -> so position 3 is I, not H. We need position 3 to be H. Words like ""MAHAT"" not a word. ""BAHT"" is 4 letters. Not many common words with _ A H T _

What about ""YACHT"" but Y(1), A(2), C(3)? C is absent, and also position 3 is C, not H. Not good.

Perhaps H in position 3 is rare. Let's think of words ending with T and having A in second and T in fourth.

Another idea: if H is in position 5, then the word is _ A _ T H

For example: ""DEATH"" but D, E, A, T, H -> E is absent, so invalid.
""HEATH"" has H in first and E, but E absent and H in first is not allowed (from feedback, H not in position 1).
""PATH"" is 4 letters.
""BATHS"" but S is absent.
""LATHS"" has L and S absent.
""OATHS"" has O, A, T, H, S -> S absent.

But we need a word without E, and without S, L, etc.

What about ""MATCH""? But C is absent.

Perhaps ""PATCH"" but C absent.

This is tricky. Maybe H is not in position 5? But it must be somewhere.

Another possibility: the word might have H in position 3, but we need a valid word.

List of words with pattern _ A _ T _ and containing H, and avoiding C,R,N,E,L,S.

Since we know H is present, and positions: 2 is A, 4 is T.

So the word: pos1, A, pos3, T, pos5.

And H must be in pos3 or pos5.

Also, the word must be 5 letters.

Possible words:

- If H in pos3: then _ A H T _
  - Possible: ""DAHTS"" not a word. ""LAHTS"" not a word. ""MAHTS"" not a word. ""PAHTS"" not a word. ""RAHTS"" not a word. ""WAHTS"" not a word. I can't think of any common English word with this pattern. So probably H is not in position 3.

- Therefore, H must be in position 5. So the word is _ A _ T H

Now, we need words of the form _ A _ T H, avoiding C,R,N,E,L,S.

Common words:
- ""BATH"" is 4 letters.
- ""PATH"" 4 letters.
- ""MATH"" 4 letters.
- 5-letter words: ""DEATH"" has E -> absent, invalid.
- ""HEATH"" has E -> invalid.
- ""NEATH"" has N and E -> invalid.
- ""WATTH"" not a word.
- ""LATHE"" has L and E -> invalid.
- ""BATHE"" has E -> invalid.
- ""HATHA"" not common, and H in first? But H not in position 1.

What about ""YACHT""? But that has C and no H at the end.

Perhaps ""PITHA"" not a word.

I need to think of other words. Maybe ""DATOH"" not a word.

Another idea: perhaps ""FAITH"" but that is F,A,I,T,H -> so position 3 is I, not H. But H is at the end. So for ""FAITH"", it is _ A _ T H with H in position 5.

And ""FAITH"" has F, A, I, T, H.

Now, check the absent letters: C,R,N,E,L,S are absent. F, I, T, H: T is already known, F and I are new, and H is present.

T is already confirmed, so we don't need to test T again.

In ""FAITH"", the letters are F, A, I, T, H.

A and T are already known positions, so we are testing F, I, and H (position 5).

But H is present, so if we put H in position 5, we can confirm if it is correct there.

Similarly, I is a new letter.

But is ""FAITH"" valid? Yes.

Another word: ""GAITH"" not a word.

""HAITH"" not common.

""WAIFT"" not a word.

""BAITH"" not a word.

""MAIST"" has S and T, but S is absent.

So ""FAITH"" seems a candidate.

But we have to avoid E, which we do.

Another word: ""DAINT"" but N is absent.

""TAWTH"" not a word.

So ""FAITH"" might be a good guess.

But let's see the pattern: if the secret word is _ A _ T H, and we guess ""FAITH"", which is F A I T H.

If the secret word has H in position 5, then in ""FAITH"", H is in position 5, so it should be marked correct if that's the case.

Similarly, we can test if I is in the word.

But we don't know if I is present or not.

Another candidate: ""PATIO"" but that has P,A,T,I,O -> but T is in position 3? P(1), A(2), T(3), I(4), O(5). But we need T in position 4, not 3. So not matching.

We need T in position 4.

So back to ""FAITH"": F(1), A(2), I(3), T(4), H(5)

This matches the pattern: position 2 is A, position 4 is T, and we are testing H in position 5.

Also, it uses F and I, which are new.

We could test H in position 3 with a different word, but we couldn't find one, so likely H is in position 5.

Perhaps ""BATCH"" but C is absent.

So I think ""FAITH"" is a reasonable guess.

But let's think of other options.

What about ""DUTCH""? But C absent.

""POTCH"" has C.

""MITCH"" has C.

Another word: ""WIGHT"" but has G and H, but W(1), I(2), G(3), H(4), T(5) -> but we need A in position 2 and T in position 4, so not.

We must have A in 2 and T in 4.

So the only pattern is _ A ? T H

And ? is the third letter, which can be various.

In ""FAITH"", ? is I.

Other possibilities: ""MAITH"" not a word.

""PAITH"" not a word.

""RAITH"" not a word.

""TAITH"" not a word.

""BAITH"" not a word.

""GAITH"" not a word.

""HAITH"" not standard.

""JAITH"" not a word.

""KAITH"" not a word.

""LAITH"" is a word? I think ""laith"" is an obsolete word for barn, but not common. And L is absent? L is absent, so we cannot use L.

L is absent, so no.

""QAITH"" not a word.

""VAITH"" not a word.

""WAITH"" not a word.

""XAITH"" not.

So ""FAITH"" seems the most common word that fits.

Another one: ""EYRTH"" not a word.

So I think ""FAITH"" is a good choice.

But we have to consider that if H is in position 5, then in ""FAITH"", H should be correct, and we can confirm.

If not, then we have a problem, but from feedback, H must be in the word, so position 5 is the only option left.

Position 3 we couldn't find a word, so likely position 5.

Therefore, I'll go with ""FAITH"".

But let's double-check the feedback.

We know:
- A in position 2 (correct)
- T in position 4 (correct)
- H present but not in position 1, so must be in 3 or 5.
- If we assume H in 5, then the word is _ A ? T H

In ""FAITH"", we are guessing F, A, I, T, H.

If the secret word has H in 5, then H will be correct.

If the secret word has H in 3, then in ""FAITH"", H is in 5, which would be wrong position or absent? But H is present, so if it's in position 3, then in position 5 it should be marked as wrong position (since H is in the word but not in that position).

But in our guess, we are putting H in 5 to test.

If we get H marked as correct, then we know it's in 5.

If marked as wrong position, then H must be in position 3, and we need to find a word with H in 3.

But since we couldn't find a common word with _ A H T _, it might be that H is in 5.

To be safe, we can choose a word that has H in position 5 and a common letter in position 3.

""FAITH"" uses I in position 3, which is common.

Another word: ""MOUTH"" has M, O, U, T, H -> but T is in position 4? M(1), O(2), U(3), T(4), H(5). But we need A in position 2, not O. So not.

""SOUTH"" has S, which is absent.

""ROUTH"" has R, absent.

""DOUTH"" has D, O, U, T, H -> O(2), but we need A in 2.

Not.

""TOUCH"" has C and O in 2.

No.

So ""FAITH"" seems best.

Perhaps ""PATHS"" but S absent.

I think we should go with ""FAITH"".

So third guess: ""FAITH""### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C(absent), R(absent), A(present but wrong position), N(absent), E(absent).  
  - This means:  
    - A is in the secret word but not in position 3.  
    - C, R, N, and E are **not** in the secret word.  

- **Guess 2: ""halts""** → H(present but wrong position), A(correct position), L(absent), T(correct position), S(absent).  
  - This means:  
    - A is in the correct position (position 2).  
    - T is in the correct position (position 4).  
    - H is in the word but not in position 1.  
    - L and S are **not** in the secret word.  

### Key Insights
- **Confirmed letters and positions**:  
  - Position 2: A  
  - Position 4: T  
- **Present letter (wrong position)**:  
  - H is in the word but not in position 1. Since positions 2 and 4 are fixed (A and T), H must be in position 3 or 5.  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, L, S (these cannot appear in the word).  
- **Unknown positions**: 1, 3, and 5.  
- **Strategy for next guess**:  
  - Test H in position 5 (since position 3 is less common for H in this pattern, and no common words fit with H in position 3).  
  - Include new common letters (e.g., I, F, O, M, P) to maximize information.  
  - Avoid absent letters.  
  - The word must fit the pattern: `_ A _ T _` with H likely in position 5 (e.g., `_ A _ T H`).  

### Choosing the Next Guess
- **Ideal word**: Must include H (to test position 5), avoid absent letters, and use high-frequency unused consonants/vowels.  
- **Selected word: ""FAITH""**  
  - Fits the pattern: `F A I T H` (position 2 = A, position 4 = T, position 5 = H).  
  - Tests:  
    - H in position 5 (if correct, confirms H's position; if wrong position, H must be in position 3).  
    - New letters: F (position 1) and I (position 3), both common and untested.  
  - Avoids all absent letters (C, R, N, E, L, S).  
- **Why not other words?**  
  - Words like ""DEATH"" or ""HEATH"" contain E (absent).  
  - Words like ""PATHS"" or ""BATHS"" contain S (absent).  
  - No common words fit `_ A H T _` (H in position 3), making position 5 more likely.  

This guess will clarify the position of H and reveal if F or I are present.",Guess 3: faith -> FEEDBACK: F(✓) A(✓) I(✓) T(✓) H(✓),SUCCESS
