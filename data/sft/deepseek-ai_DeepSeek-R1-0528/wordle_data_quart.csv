We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
 This means:
   - 'A' is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 3, since ""crane"" is C-R-A-N-E, so index 2 if 0-based? But positions are usually counted from 1).
   Let's clarify the feedback positions: 
     Position 1: C -> x (not in word)
     Position 2: R -> - (in word but wrong position)
     Position 3: A -> ✓ (correct)
     Position 4: N -> x (not in word)
     Position 5: E -> x (not in word)

 So we know:
   - The secret word has the letter 'A' in the third position (so _ _ A _ _).
   - The letter 'R' is in the word but not in the second position.
   - Letters C, N, and E are not in the word.

 We need to make a second guess that:
   - Must be a 5-letter word.
   - Has 'A' in the third position.
   - Includes 'R' (but not in the second position).
   - Does not include C, N, or E.

 Also, note: we should try to include other common letters to get more information.

 Let me think of words that fit:
   Pattern: _ _ A _ _

 And must include 'R' (in position 1, 4, or 5? since it can't be in position 2).

 Common letters we haven't tried yet: we can use S, T, L, O, etc.

 Possibilities: 
   Starting with R: R _ A _ _ 
     But R is already known to be in the word, but not necessarily at the start. We can put R at the beginning? 
   Words: Maybe ""TRAMP"" but note we can't have E and we know E is not present.

 Since E is out, let's avoid words with E.

 Options for words with R and no C, N, E:

   Consider putting R in the first position: R _ A _ _
     Words: ""RAM"" something? But 5 letters: ""RAPID"" (but D is new, and we don't know about P and I). However, we must avoid E and we are avoiding E.

   Alternatively, put R in the fourth position: _ _ A R _
     Words: ""PARTY"" (has T and Y, but also P) — but ""PARTY"" has P-A-R-T-Y, so third letter is R? No: P-A-R-T-Y, positions: 1:P, 2:A -> but we need A in third? Actually, no: we need third letter to be A. So ""PARTY"" is P-A-R-T-Y -> positions: P(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), Y(5). That doesn't have A in third. A is in second.

   We need third letter A: so pattern _ _ A _ _

   Let me try with R in first position: R _ A _ _
     Example: ""RADAR"" — but has R first, and then A is third? No: R(1)-A(2)-D(3)-A(4)-R(5) — so the third letter is D, not A.

   Actually, ""crane"" was C-R-A-N-E, so letters: C (1), R (2), A (3), N (4), E (5). So for third letter A.

   So pattern: positions: 1: ?, 2: not R, 3: A, 4: ?, 5: ?

   And R must be in one of positions 1,4,5? Not in 2 and not in 3 (because 3 is A). So possible: position1, position4, or position5.

   Let me try to find words with A at the third position and R in position1,4, or5.

   Option: R at position1 -> ""R _ A _ _""
     Words: ""RABID"" (but note: R-A-B-I-D -> that would have A at second, not third). So we must skip positions: 
        Position1: R
        Position2: must be not R (but can be any other letter except excluded ones) and not A? Because A is fixed at third? Actually, no: A is only fixed at position3, so position2 can be any letter that isn't R (since R is elsewhere) and not excluded.

     We need: R ? A ? ? -> meaning: letter1=R, letter2=?, letter3=A, letter4=?, letter5=?
     Example: ""ROAST"" -> R-O-A-S-T -> this has O at position2. But are O, S, T allowed? We haven't been told they are excluded. Also, we know E is out, so ""ROAST"" doesn't have E. But we also know C, N are out. ""ROAST"" doesn't have C or N.

     ""ROAST"" — let me check: letters: R, O, A, S, T — no C, N, E -> so it's allowed.

   But note: we have feedback that R is in the word but not at position2, and in ""ROAST"" R is at position1 — that's fine. Also, A is at position3 — good.

   Then, we can use ""ROAST"". Let's think of other possibilities too.

   What about R at position4? Then pattern: _ _ A R _
     Words: 
        ""STARK"" — S-T-A-R-K: third letter is A, fourth letter is R -> this fits. 
        Letters: S,T,A,R,K — no C,N,E -> allowed.

   Or R at position5? Then pattern: _ _ A _ R
     Words: 
        ""GNAWR"" — has N and W? But we know N is excluded, so we cannot have N. So avoid any word with N or C or E.

        ""STAIR"" — S-T-A-I-R: third letter A, fifth R -> but note: we haven't excluded I. However, it has I? And S and T. But also note that ""STAIR"" has an I? Yes. And no C,N,E.

   But we need to maximize information: so we want to use new letters that we haven't tried.

   In our first guess we tried: C, R, A, N, E. 
   So we should avoid C, N, E and reuse A (which is fixed) and R (which we know is present). We can use new letters.

   For ""ROAST"": 
      has O, S, T — those are new. 
   For ""STARK"":
      has S, T, R, K — but we already tried R? But we must include R because we know it's in the word. And A is in the word. 
   However, note we are allowed to reuse letters we know are present? But actually, we know R and A are present, so it's okay. The key is to cover new letters.

   Comparing:
      ""ROAST"": new letters O, S, T.
      ""STARK"": new letters S, T, K (and R and A are reused).

   Also, ""PARTY"" doesn't fit because the A is in second position.

   Another option: ""PLAIT"" — but no R? We must include R because we know it's present.

   Actually, the guess must include R because we know R is in the word? But wait: the rules don't require that we must use known letters? However, since we know R is present and we only have 6 tries, we should probably try to use it to confirm its position.

   So we need to include R. Therefore, let's choose between:
      ""ROAST"" (R at position1) 
      ""STARK"" (R at position4) 
      ""STAIR"" (R at position5)

   However, ""STAIR"" has I, but we don't know if I is in the word. Similarly, ""STARK"" has K.

   Another common word: ""ALTER"" — but we know E is excluded, so no.

   We can also consider: ""TRAIN"" — but N is excluded, so we cannot use that.

   ""RAPID"" — R-A-P-I-D -> here A is at position2, not position3 -> invalid.

   How about ""DRAWL"": D-R-A-W-L -> this has R at position2 which we know is not allowed? Because feedback said R is in the word but not at position2. And in ""DRAWL"", R is at position2 -> avoid.

   So let me choose ""ROAST"". Why? Because it has common letters O, S, T, which can help eliminate or confirm more letters.

   Therefore, I will go with ""ROAST"".

   But note: we are avoiding E, which is not in ""ROAST"". And avoiding C,N, which are not present.

   So second guess: ""ROAST""

   We'll see the feedback and then adjust.

<guess>roast</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- ""C"", ""N"", and ""E"" are **not** in the secret word.
- ""R"" is in the word but **not** in position 2.
- ""A"" is in the word and **correctly positioned** at spot 3.

For the second guess, I need:
- A 5-letter word with ""A"" in position 3.
- Includes ""R"" (in positions 1, 4, or 5 only, since it can't be in position 2).
- Excludes **C, E, N**.
- Uses new common letters (e.g., **S, T, O**) to test for presence/position.

A suitable word is **""ROAST""**:
- **R** in position 1 (not position 2).
- **A** in position 3.
- Tests new letters **O, S, T**.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, E, N).

<guess>roast</guess>",roast,"We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)

     Position 4: N -> x (not in word)
     Position 5: E -> x (not in word)

 So we know:

   - The letter 'R' is in the word but not in the second position.
   - Letters C, N, and E are not in the word.

Actually, no: we need third letter to be A. So ""PARTY"" is P-A-R-T-Y -> positions: P(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), Y(5). That doesn't have A in third. A is in second.

   We need third letter A: so pattern _ _ A _ _

   Let me try with R in first position: R _ A _ _
     Example: ""RADAR"" — but has R first, and then A is third? No: R(1)-A(2)-D(3)-A(4)-R(5) — so the third letter is D, not A.

   Actually, ""crane"" was C-R-A-N-E, so letters: C (1), R (2), A (3), N (4), E (5). So for third letter A.

   So pattern: positions: 1: ?, 2: not R, 3: A, 4: ?, 5: ?

   And R must be in one of positions 1,4,5? Not in 2 and not in 3 (because 3 is A). So possible: position1, position4, or position5.

   Let me try to find words with A at the third position and R in position1,4, or5.

   Option: R at position1 -> ""R _ A _ _""
     Words: ""RABID"" (but note: R-A-B-I-D -> that would have A at second, not third). So we must skip positions: 
        Position1: R
        Position2: must be not R (but can be any other letter except excluded ones) and not A? Because A is fixed at third? Actually, no: A is only fixed at position3, so position2 can be any letter that isn't R (since R is elsewhere) and not excluded.

     We need: R ? A ? ? -> meaning: letter1=R, letter2=?, letter3=A, letter4=?, letter5=?
     Example: ""ROAST"" -> R-O-A-S-T -> this has O at position2. But are O, S, T allowed? We haven't been told they are excluded. Also, we know E is out, so ""ROAST"" doesn't have E. But we also know C, N are out. ""ROAST"" doesn't have C or N.

   Then, we can use ""ROAST"". Let's think of other possibilities too.

 Also, note: we should try to include other common letters to get more information.

 Let me think of words that fit:
   Pattern: _ _ A _ _

 And must include 'R' (in position 1, 4, or 5? since it can't be in position 2).

 Common letters we haven't tried yet: we can use S, T, L, O, etc.

 Possibilities: 
   Starting with R: R _ A _ _ 
     But R is already known to be in the word, but not necessarily at the start. We can put R at the beginning? 
   Words: Maybe ""TRAMP"" but note we can't have E and we know E is not present.

 Since E is out, let's avoid words with E.

 Options for words with R and no C, N, E:

   Consider putting R in the first position: R _ A _ _
     Words: ""RAM"" something? But 5 letters: ""RAPID"" (but D is new, and we don't know about P and I). However, we must avoid E and we are avoiding E.

   Alternatively, put R in the fourth position: _ _ A R _
     Words: ""PARTY"" (has T and Y, but also P) — but ""PARTY"" has P-A-R-T-Y, so third letter is R? No: P-A-R-T-Y, positions: 1:P, 2:A -> but we need A in third? Actually, no: we need third letter to be A. So ""PARTY"" is P-A-R-T-Y -> positions: P(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), Y(5). That doesn't have A in third. A is in second.

   We need third letter A: so pattern _ _ A _ _

   Let me try with R in first position: R _ A _ _
     Example: ""RADAR"" — but has R first, and then A is third? No: R(1)-A(2)-D(3)-A(4)-R(5) — so the third letter is D, not A.

   Actually, ""crane"" was C-R-A-N-E, so letters: C (1), R (2), A (3), N (4), E (5). So for third letter A.

   So pattern: positions: 1: ?, 2: not R, 3: A, 4: ?, 5: ?

   And R must be in one of positions 1,4,5? Not in 2 and not in 3 (because 3 is A). So possible: position1, position4, or position5.

   Let me try to find words with A at the third position and R in position1,4, or5.

   Option: R at position1 -> ""R _ A _ _""
     Words: ""RABID"" (but note: R-A-B-I-D -> that would have A at second, not third). So we must skip positions: 
        Position1: R
        Position2: must be not R (but can be any other letter except excluded ones) and not A? Because A is fixed at third? Actually, no: A is only fixed at position3, so position2 can be any letter that isn't R (since R is elsewhere) and not excluded.

     We need: R ? A ? ? -> meaning: letter1=R, letter2=?, letter3=A, letter4=?, letter5=?
     Example: ""ROAST"" -> R-O-A-S-T -> this has O at position2. But are O, S, T allowed? We haven't been told they are excluded. Also, we know E is out, so ""ROAST"" doesn't have E. But we also know C, N are out. ""ROAST"" doesn't have C or N.

     ""ROAST"" — let me check: letters: R, O, A, S, T — no C, N, E -> so it's allowed.

   But note: we have feedback that R is in the word but not at position2, and in ""ROAST"" R is at position1 — that's fine. Also, A is at position3 — good.

   Then, we can use ""ROAST"". Let's think of other possibilities too.

   What about R at position4? Then pattern: _ _ A R _
     Words: 
        ""STARK"" — S-T-A-R-K: third letter is A, fourth letter is R -> this fits. 
        Letters: S,T,A,R,K — no C,N,E -> allowed.

   Or R at position5? Then pattern: _ _ A _ R
     Words: 
        ""GNAWR"" — has N and W? But we know N is excluded, so we cannot have N. So avoid any word with N or C or E.

        ""STAIR"" — S-T-A-I-R: third letter A, fifth R -> but note: we haven't excluded I. However, it has I? And S and T. But also note that ""STAIR"" has an I? Yes. And no C,N,E.

   But we need to maximize information: so we want to use new letters that we haven't tried.

   In our first guess we tried: C, R, A, N, E. 
   So we should avoid C, N, E and reuse A (which is fixed) and R (which we know is present). We can use new letters.

   For ""ROAST"": 
      has O, S, T — those are new. 
   For ""STARK"":
      has S, T, R, K — but we already tried R? But we must include R because we know it's in the word. And A is in the word. 
   However, note we are allowed to reuse letters we know are present? But actually, we know R and A are present, so it's okay. The key is to cover new letters.

   Comparing:
      ""ROAST"": new letters O, S, T.
      ""STARK"": new letters S, T, K (and R and A are reused).

   Also, ""PARTY"" doesn't fit because the A is in second position.

   Another option: ""PLAIT"" — but no R? We must include R because we know it's present.

   Actually, the guess must include R because we know R is in the word? But wait: the rules don't require that we must use known letters? However, since we know R is present and we only have 6 tries, we should probably try to use it to confirm its position.

   So we need to include R. Therefore, let's choose between:
      ""ROAST"" (R at position1) 
      ""STARK"" (R at position4) 
      ""STAIR"" (R at position5)

   However, ""STAIR"" has I, but we don't know if I is in the word. Similarly, ""STARK"" has K.

   Another common word: ""ALTER"" — but we know E is excluded, so no.

   We can also consider: ""TRAIN"" — but N is excluded, so we cannot use that.

   ""RAPID"" — R-A-P-I-D -> here A is at position2, not position3 -> invalid.

   How about ""DRAWL"": D-R-A-W-L -> this has R at position2 which we know is not allowed? Because feedback said R is in the word but not at position2. And in ""DRAWL"", R is at position2 -> avoid.

   So let me choose ""ROAST"". Why? Because it has common letters O, S, T, which can help eliminate or confirm more letters.

   Therefore, I will go with ""ROAST"".

   But note: we are avoiding E, which is not in ""ROAST"". And avoiding C,N, which are not present.

   So second guess: ""ROAST""

   We'll see the feedback and then adjust.

<guess>roast</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- ""C"", ""N"", and ""E"" are **not** in the secret word.
- ""R"" is in the word but **not** in position 2.
- ""A"" is in the word and **correctly positioned** at spot 3.

For the second guess, I need:
- A 5-letter word with ""A"" in position 3.
- Includes ""R"" (in positions 1, 4, or 5 only, since it can't be in position 2).
- Excludes **C, E, N**.
- Uses new common letters (e.g., **S, T, O**) to test for presence/position.

A suitable word is **""ROAST""**:
- **R** in position 1 (not position 2).
- **A** in position 3.
- Tests new letters **O, S, T**.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, E, N).

We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: - (in word, but wrong position)
  A: ✓ (correct position)
  N: x (not in word)
  E: x (not in word)

Second guess: ""roast""
  R: - (in word, but wrong position) -> so R is in the word, but not at position 1, 2, or 3? 
    Wait, in ""roast"": 
      Position 1: R -> feedback says ""-"", meaning R is in the word but not at position 1.
      We already knew from the first guess that R is not at position 2 (from ""crane"").
      And position 3 is A (fixed), so R cannot be at position 3 either.
  O: x (not in word)
  A: ✓ (correct position, so the third letter is A)
  S: x (not in word)
  T: ✓ (correct position, so the fifth letter is T)

So now we know:
  Secret word has: 
    - Third letter: A
    - Fifth letter: T
    - The letter R is in the word, but not at positions 1, 2, or 3. Therefore, it must be at position 4? Because the only positions left are 4 and 5, but position 5 is T (fixed). So R must be at position 4? 
      But wait: position 5 is T, so R cannot be at position 5. Therefore, R must be at position 4.

  However, in the second guess, we have ""roast"" which has:
      position 1: R (wrong position, so R is not at 1)
      position 2: O (not in word)
      position 3: A (correct)
      position 4: S (not in word) -> but we now think R should be at position 4? 
      position 5: T (correct)

  The feedback for the second guess says S is not in the word. So position 4 in the secret word is not S, and we now think it must be R? 

  But let's confirm: 
    We know R is in the word and cannot be at positions 1, 2, or 3. The only positions left are 4 and 5. But position 5 is T, so R must be at position 4.

  Therefore, we can deduce that the secret word has R at position 4.

  So the secret word pattern is: _ _ A R T

  Also, we know the following letters are not in the word: C, E, N, O, S.

  Now, we need to find the first and second letters.

  We have two positions to fill: positions 1 and 2.

  We know the letters that are not in the word: C, E, N, O, S. Also, we have used: R, A, T (but they are placed).

  We need to choose a word that fits the pattern: _ _ A R T

  And the letters in positions 1 and 2 must be letters that we haven't eliminated and are not in the exclusion list.

  Exclusion list: C, E, N, O, S.

  Also, we must avoid using any of these. We can use any other letters.

  Let's think of common letters that can be in the first two positions.

  Possibilities for the word: 
    The word ends with ""ART"", so it's like ??ART.

  We can try to think of 5-letter words ending with ""ART"".

  Common words: 
    ""START"" -> but S is excluded, so no.
    ""PART"" -> 5 letters? ""PARTY"" is 5 but ends with Y? 
    Actually, we need exactly ""ART"" at the end: so the last three letters are A, R, T (positions 3,4,5).

  So the word is: [letter1][letter2]ART

  We can list words: 
    ""DART"" is 4 letters, so no.
    5-letter words: 
        ""HEART"" -> H E A R T -> but E is excluded? Yes, E is excluded (from first guess). So no.
        ""CHART"" -> C is excluded, so no.
        ""PARTY"" -> P A R T Y -> but that has A at position2 and R at position3? Not matching: we need A at position3? 
          Actually, ""PARTY"": P(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), Y(5) -> but we need A at position3 and R at position4? So no.

  We need the pattern: 
    position1: ?
    position2: ?
    position3: A
    position4: R
    position5: T

  So the word is: [1][2] A R T

  Examples:
    ""HEART"" is H E A R T -> but E is excluded.
    ""CART"" is 4 letters.
    ""WARTY"" -> W A R T Y -> but that has A at position2? We need A at position3? So no.

  Actually, we need the third letter to be A, so the word must be: 
      [1] [2] A R T

  So the first two letters are before the A.

  Words: 
    ""BAKER"" -> but that's 5 letters? B-A-K-E-R -> no, because we need A at position3? 
    We need to look for words that have the A at the third position and then R and T.

  Let me think: 
    ""PLART"" is not a word.
    ""BLART"" is not common.
    ""QUART"" -> Q U A R T -> that's 5 letters: 
        Q(1), U(2), A(3), R(4), T(5) -> perfect.

  But is ""QUART"" a valid word? Yes, meaning a unit of liquid measure.

  Now, check the letters: Q and U. 
    We haven't encountered Q or U before. Are they excluded? 
    We only know C, E, N, O, S are excluded. So Q and U are allowed.

  But we have to make sure that we haven't used them? We haven't, so we can use.

  However, we are not forced to use ""QUART"" because we might want to test more letters? But note: we have only 6 tries and we have 2 positions to figure out. We can try to guess the entire word if we are confident.

  But let's see: we have two letters missing. We can also try a word that uses common letters to test multiple possibilities.

  However, we have already used 2 guesses and we have 4 left. We can try to guess and then if wrong, we get more feedback.

  But note: if we guess ""QUART"", and it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on Q and U.

  Alternatively, we can try a word that uses other common letters to cover more ground.

  But we know the pattern: _ _ A R T

  The missing letters are only two: positions 1 and 2.

  We can list possible letters for position1 and position2. They must be letters that are not in the exclusion list (C, E, N, O, S) and not A, R, T (which are already placed, but they can appear again? But in Wordle, a letter can appear multiple times? The feedback doesn't say anything about duplicates. However, we haven't seen any duplicate so far.

  But note: in the first guess, we had ""crane"" and R was present, and in the second guess we had R again and it was present. So if the secret word had two R's, the feedback would have shown two R's? Actually, the feedback for the second guess: R was marked as present (but wrong position) even though we now know R is at position4. So if there were two R's, we might have gotten a second R marked? But we don't have that. So probably the secret word has only one R.

  Similarly, A and T are fixed and we don't have duplicates.

  So for positions 1 and 2, we need two distinct letters that are not in {C, E, N, O, S, A, R, T}? But wait, A, R, T are in the word, but they are already placed. We can use other letters.

  Possible letters: all letters except C, E, N, O, S, and also we know the word has R and A and T. But we can have other letters.

  We can try to use a word that has two new common letters to test.

  For example, we can try ""PARTY"" but that doesn't fit the pattern (A is at position2, not 3). 

  We need the pattern: [1][2]ART

  Common words: 
    ""QUART"" as above.
    ""DWARF"" -> D W A R F -> but then the last two are R and F? We need R at position4 and T at position5. So no.
    ""GIANT"" -> G I A N T -> but N is excluded, and also the last letter is T, but position4 is N? We need R at position4. So no.

  Another word: ""BOART"" -> not common, and O is excluded.

  ""HEART"" is out because of E.

  ""CHART"" is out because of C.

  ""START"" is out because of S.

  ""WARTY"" -> W A R T Y -> but that's W at1, A at2, R at3, T at4, Y at5 -> doesn't match because we need A at3 and R at4? So no.

  So ""QUART"" seems a good candidate.

  But let me check: are there other possibilities? 

  We can also have:
    ""YARTS"" -> but S is excluded and also the pattern: Y A R T S -> A at position2, not 3.

  ""EARTH"" -> E is excluded.

  ""MARTY"" -> M A R T Y -> A at position2, not 3.

  It seems that the pattern [1][2]ART is not very common. 

  Another word: ""GUARD"" -> G U A R D -> but that ends with D, not T.

  We need the last two to be R and T, so the word must end with ""RT"", and the third letter is A.

  So the word is: [1][2]ART

  Other possibilities: 
    ""QUART"" (as above)
    ""BOART"" (but O is excluded and not common)
    ""DUART"" (a surname? not common)
    ""KUART"" (not a word)

  So ""QUART"" is the most common.

  But note: we haven't tried the letter U and Q. We don't know if they are in the word. 

  Alternatively, we can try a word that uses more common letters to narrow down. For example, we can try a word that has L, I, D, etc. in the first two positions.

  But we have the pattern fixed: _ _ A R T. So if we guess a word that fits the pattern, we can get direct feedback on the first two letters.

  We can try ""QUART"" and see.

  But let's see if there are other words that fit and use common letters we haven't tried. We haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

  We can try ""PARTY"" but it doesn't fit the pattern.

  Another idea: we can try a word that doesn't necessarily fit the pattern but tests common letters for positions 1 and 2? But that might be inefficient because we know the last three are fixed.

  Since we have the pattern, it's better to guess a word that fits the pattern and uses two new letters.

  So I propose ""QUART"".

  But note: if we guess ""QUART"", and if it's not the word, we get feedback on Q and U. Then we can adjust.

  Alternatively, we can try ""DIRTY"": D I R T Y -> but that doesn't have A at position3? We need A at position3. So we cannot use that because it doesn't fit the pattern.

  We must have the pattern: [1][2]ART.

  So let's go with ""QUART"".

  But wait: in the second guess, we had ""roast"" and we got feedback that T is at position5. So the secret word ends with T. And we have A at position3 and R at position4. So the pattern is fixed.

  Therefore, I will guess ""QUART"".

  If it's not correct, we get feedback on Q and U.

  But note: we have 4 more guesses, so it's acceptable.

  So the third guess: ""QUART""

  However, let me double-check the pattern: 
    Q at position1, U at position2, A at position3, R at position4, T at position5 -> matches.

  And it doesn't contain any excluded letters (C, E, N, O, S).

  So I'll go with that.

<guess>quart</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Secret word pattern**: The third letter is **A**, the fourth letter is **R**, and the fifth letter is **T** (from ""roast"" feedback: A(✓) at position 3, T(✓) at position 5, and R must be at position 4 since it can't be in positions 1–3 and position 5 is taken by T).
- **Excluded letters**: C, E, N, O, S (from ""crane"" and ""roast"" feedback).
- **Known letters in word**: A, R, T (with fixed positions), and R is confirmed present.

The secret word must match the pattern: `_ _ A R T`. After eliminating invalid letters, the word **""QUART""** fits:
- **Q** and **U** are new, untested letters (not excluded).
- The pattern is satisfied: Q (position 1), U (position 2), A (position 3), R (position 4), T (position 5).
- If correct, this guess solves the puzzle. If incorrect, feedback on Q and U will help narrow down the remaining possibilities (e.g., words like ""DWART"" or ""YARTS"" are invalid due to exclusions).

<guess>quart</guess>",quart,"We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: - (in word, but wrong position)
  A: ✓ (correct position)
  N: x (not in word)
  E: x (not in word)

Second guess: ""roast""
  R: - (in word, but wrong position) -> so R is in the word, but not at position 1, 2, or 3? 
    Wait, in ""roast"": 
      Position 1: R -> feedback says ""-"", meaning R is in the word but not at position 1.
      We already knew from the first guess that R is not at position 2 (from ""crane"").
      And position 3 is A (fixed), so R cannot be at position 3 either.
  O: x (not in word)
  A: ✓ (correct position, so the third letter is A)
  S: x (not in word)
  T: ✓ (correct position, so the fifth letter is T)

So now we know:
  Secret word has: 
    - Third letter: A
    - Fifth letter: T
    - The letter R is in the word, but not at positions 1, 2, or 3. Therefore, it must be at position 4? Because the only positions left are 4 and 5, but position 5 is T (fixed). So R must be at position 4? 
      But wait: position 5 is T, so R cannot be at position 5. Therefore, R must be at position 4.

  However, in the second guess, we have ""roast"" which has:
      position 1: R (wrong position, so R is not at 1)
      position 2: O (not in word)
      position 3: A (correct)
      position 4: S (not in word) -> but we now think R should be at position 4? 
      position 5: T (correct)

  The feedback for the second guess says S is not in the word. So position 4 in the secret word is not S, and we now think it must be R? 

  But let's confirm: 
    We know R is in the word and cannot be at positions 1, 2, or 3. The only positions left are 4 and 5. But position 5 is T, so R must be at position 4.

  Therefore, we can deduce that the secret word has R at position 4.

  So the secret word pattern is: _ _ A R T

  Also, we know the following letters are not in the word: C, E, N, O, S.

  Now, we need to find the first and second letters.

  We have two positions to fill: positions 1 and 2.

  We know the letters that are not in the word: C, E, N, O, S. Also, we have used: R, A, T (but they are placed).

  We need to choose a word that fits the pattern: _ _ A R T

  And the letters in positions 1 and 2 must be letters that we haven't eliminated and are not in the exclusion list.

  Exclusion list: C, E, N, O, S.

  Also, we must avoid using any of these. We can use any other letters.

  Let's think of common letters that can be in the first two positions.

  Possibilities for the word: 
    The word ends with ""ART"", so it's like ??ART.

  We can try to think of 5-letter words ending with ""ART"".

  Common words: 
    ""START"" -> but S is excluded, so no.
    ""PART"" -> 5 letters? ""PARTY"" is 5 but ends with Y? 
    Actually, we need exactly ""ART"" at the end: so the last three letters are A, R, T (positions 3,4,5).

  So the word is: [letter1][letter2]ART

  We can list words: 
    ""DART"" is 4 letters, so no.
    5-letter words: 
        ""HEART"" -> H E A R T -> but E is excluded? Yes, E is excluded (from first guess). So no.
        ""CHART"" -> C is excluded, so no.
        ""PARTY"" -> P A R T Y -> but that has A at position2 and R at position3? Not matching: we need A at position3? 
          Actually, ""PARTY"": P(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), Y(5) -> but we need A at position3 and R at position4? So no.

  We need the pattern: 
    position1: ?
    position2: ?
    position3: A
    position4: R
    position5: T

  So the word is: [1][2] A R T

  Examples:
    ""HEART"" is H E A R T -> but E is excluded.
    ""CART"" is 4 letters.
    ""WARTY"" -> W A R T Y -> but that has A at position2? We need A at position3? So no.

  Actually, we need the third letter to be A, so the word must be: 
      [1] [2] A R T

  So the first two letters are before the A.

  Words: 
    ""BAKER"" -> but that's 5 letters? B-A-K-E-R -> no, because we need A at position3? 
    We need to look for words that have the A at the third position and then R and T.

  Let me think: 
    ""PLART"" is not a word.
    ""BLART"" is not common.
    ""QUART"" -> Q U A R T -> that's 5 letters: 
        Q(1), U(2), A(3), R(4), T(5) -> perfect.

  But is ""QUART"" a valid word? Yes, meaning a unit of liquid measure.

  Now, check the letters: Q and U. 
    We haven't encountered Q or U before. Are they excluded? 
    We only know C, E, N, O, S are excluded. So Q and U are allowed.

  But we have to make sure that we haven't used them? We haven't, so we can use.

  However, we are not forced to use ""QUART"" because we might want to test more letters? But note: we have only 6 tries and we have 2 positions to figure out. We can try to guess the entire word if we are confident.

  But let's see: we have two letters missing. We can also try a word that uses common letters to test multiple possibilities.

  However, we have already used 2 guesses and we have 4 left. We can try to guess and then if wrong, we get more feedback.

  But note: if we guess ""QUART"", and it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on Q and U.

  Alternatively, we can try a word that uses other common letters to cover more ground.

  But we know the pattern: _ _ A R T

  The missing letters are only two: positions 1 and 2.

  We can list possible letters for position1 and position2. They must be letters that are not in the exclusion list (C, E, N, O, S) and not A, R, T (which are already placed, but they can appear again? But in Wordle, a letter can appear multiple times? The feedback doesn't say anything about duplicates. However, we haven't seen any duplicate so far.

  But note: in the first guess, we had ""crane"" and R was present, and in the second guess we had R again and it was present. So if the secret word had two R's, the feedback would have shown two R's? Actually, the feedback for the second guess: R was marked as present (but wrong position) even though we now know R is at position4. So if there were two R's, we might have gotten a second R marked? But we don't have that. So probably the secret word has only one R.

  Similarly, A and T are fixed and we don't have duplicates.

  So for positions 1 and 2, we need two distinct letters that are not in {C, E, N, O, S, A, R, T}? But wait, A, R, T are in the word, but they are already placed. We can use other letters.

  Possible letters: all letters except C, E, N, O, S, and also we know the word has R and A and T. But we can have other letters.

  We can try to use a word that has two new common letters to test.

  For example, we can try ""PARTY"" but that doesn't fit the pattern (A is at position2, not 3). 

  We need the pattern: [1][2]ART

  Common words: 
    ""QUART"" as above.
    ""DWARF"" -> D W A R F -> but then the last two are R and F? We need R at position4 and T at position5. So no.
    ""GIANT"" -> G I A N T -> but N is excluded, and also the last letter is T, but position4 is N? We need R at position4. So no.

  Another word: ""BOART"" -> not common, and O is excluded.

  ""HEART"" is out because of E.

  ""CHART"" is out because of C.

  ""START"" is out because of S.

  ""WARTY"" -> W A R T Y -> but that's W at1, A at2, R at3, T at4, Y at5 -> doesn't match because we need A at3 and R at4? So no.

  So ""QUART"" seems a good candidate.

  But let me check: are there other possibilities? 

  We can also have:
    ""YARTS"" -> but S is excluded and also the pattern: Y A R T S -> A at position2, not 3.

  ""EARTH"" -> E is excluded.

  ""MARTY"" -> M A R T Y -> A at position2, not 3.

  It seems that the pattern [1][2]ART is not very common. 

  Another word: ""GUARD"" -> G U A R D -> but that ends with D, not T.

  We need the last two to be R and T, so the word must end with ""RT"", and the third letter is A.

  So the word is: [1][2]ART

  Other possibilities: 
    ""QUART"" (as above)
    ""BOART"" (but O is excluded and not common)
    ""DUART"" (a surname? not common)
    ""KUART"" (not a word)

  So ""QUART"" is the most common.

  But note: we haven't tried the letter U and Q. We don't know if they are in the word. 

  Alternatively, we can try a word that uses more common letters to narrow down. For example, we can try a word that has L, I, D, etc. in the first two positions.

  We can try ""PARTY"" but it doesn't fit the pattern.

  So I propose ""QUART"".

  But note: if we guess ""QUART"", and if it's not the word, we get feedback on Q and U. Then we can adjust.

  We must have the pattern: [1][2]ART.

  So let's go with ""QUART"".

  But wait: in the second guess, we had ""roast"" and we got feedback that T is at position5. So the secret word ends with T. And we have A at position3 and R at position4. So the pattern is fixed.

  If it's not correct, we get feedback on Q and U.
