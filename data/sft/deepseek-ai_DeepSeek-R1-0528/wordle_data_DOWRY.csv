We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all are distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback on our first guess: ""crane"" resulted in C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)
 From this feedback:
   - 'R' is present in the secret word but not in the correct position (because it got '-')
   - The other letters 'C', 'A', 'N', 'E' are not in the word at all (since they got 'x')

 So the secret word contains the letter 'R' (but not in the second position because in ""crane"", R is in the second position and it was marked wrong).

 Also, note that the secret word does not contain C, A, N, E.

 Since we have only found one letter so far (R) and it must be in a different position, we can think about words that have R but not in the second position, and avoid C, A, N, E.

 Given that we have 5 letters and 1 known letter (R) but not its position, we need to choose a word that:
   - Has the letter R (in a position that isn't the second one)
   - Does not contain C, A, N, E
   - Includes other common letters to maximize information.

 Also note: The secret word has 5 letters and R is one of them, so we have 4 more unknown letters.

 Let's consider common letters that are still possible: we can use B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 A good approach is to use a word that has R and other common letters, and place R in a position we haven't tried (so not position 2). We can put R in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 We also want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Let me consider words that start with R? But note: if we put R in position 1, then we can check if R is at the beginning. However, we don't have much information so maybe a word with R in the middle or end is fine.

 A common word that comes to mind: ""ROAST"" has R (first letter) and O, A, S, T. But A was already eliminated (because in the first guess, A was marked 'x'). So we cannot use A.

 Let me avoid A because it's eliminated.

 Possibilities: ""TRYST"", but that has T and Y. Also, we haven't eliminated T. But note: the word must be 5 letters and valid.

 Alternatively: ""DRYLY"" - but that repeats Y and isn't very informative.

 Another idea: ""POURS"" has P, O, U, R, S. But we don't know about O, U, S. Also, R is in the fourth position (if spelled P-O-U-R-S). So R is at position 4.

 However, note: we must not use eliminated letters: C, A, N, E. So ""POURS"" avoids these.

 Another common word: ""TRIES"" but E is eliminated so no.

 Similarly: ""GROSS"" - G, R, O, S, S. R is at position 2? But we already tried R at position 2 and it was wrong. So we cannot put R at position 2 again. So ""GROSS"" has R at position 2 -> not allowed because we know R is not in position 2.

 We need to pick a word where R is not in position 2.

 Let me look for a word that has R in a different position:

 Possibilities:
  - Position 1: R (then we get to check if it's at the start). Words: ROOMY? But O is not eliminated. However, ROOMY has double O and also Y. But also: note that ROOMY uses O twice and we don't know about O.

  Another word: ""ROWDY"" - R, O, W, D, Y. But again, O and we have to see.

  Position 3: Let's say ""TARES"" but A is eliminated -> no.

  Position 4: ""STARL"" not a word? ""STARE"" but E and A are out -> no.

  Position 5: ""LATER"" has A and E -> no.

 So let's try to avoid eliminated letters and put R in a new position.

 Here's an idea: ""POINT"" doesn't have R -> we must include R because we know it's in the word.

 Another: ""MORPH"" - M, O, R, P, H. R at position 3. And it doesn't use A, C, N, E. This seems okay.

 But wait, we don't know anything about O, but that's fine.

 Another candidate: ""SPRIG"" - S, P, R, I, G. R is at position 3? Actually, positions: S (1), P (2), R (3), I (4), G (5). So R is at position 3. This avoids the eliminated letters.

 Another: ""QUIRK"" - Q, U, I, R, K. R at position 4.

 However, we don't know about Q, U, I, K and so on.

 Considering commonality, words with more vowels might be better? But we know the word doesn't have A, E? Only vowels left are I, O, U, and sometimes Y.

 Let me list words: 
   - ""WORLD"" has W, O, R, L, D -> R at position 3. This word: W is common? Not as much as others. Also, O and L are common.

   - ""DOUBT"" doesn't have R -> skip.

   - ""BUILT"" doesn't have R -> skip.

   - ""PRISM"" - P, R, I, S, M -> R at the second position. But wait: P (1), R (2). But we had R at position 2 in ""crane"" and it was wrong, so we cannot put R in position 2.

   ""PRISM"" is invalid because R must not be at position 2.

 How about ""VIRUS""? V, I, R, U, S -> R at position 3? Actually: positions: V (1), I (2), R (3), U (4), S (5). So R at position 3. This avoids A, C, E, N and doesn't include repeated letters.

 This seems good.

 Another candidate: ""FRISK"" -> F, R, I, S, K. But R is at position 2? So R is at the second position -> not allowed.

 We must avoid position 2 for R.

 So ""VIRUS"" seems okay.

 Another word: ""TRULY"" -> T, R, U, L, Y -> R at position 2? No: T(1), R(2) -> again second position -> skip.

 What about ""SHIRT"" -> S, H, I, R, T -> R at position 4. And avoided eliminated letters? Yes: no A, C, E, N.

 So ""SHIRT"" is another candidate.

 We can also consider ""SPURT"" -> S, P, U, R, T -> R at position 4.

 But note: we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Since we have a limited number of guesses, we should prioritize words that include common consonants (like S, T, L, M, D, etc.) and vowels (like I, O, U).

 Among ""SHIRT"", ""SPURT"", ""VIRUS"" ... let's see:

 ""SHIRT"": S, H, I, R, T -> common letters: S, T are very common. H, I are also common.
 ""VIRUS"": V is less common.

 So maybe ""SHIRT"" is better because it uses more common letters.

 However, note: the feedback we got for the first word told us that R is present but not in position 2. In ""SHIRT"", R is in position 4. That's a new position we haven't tried. So if R is in position 4 in the secret word, then we will get a '-' again? Actually, wait: if R is not in the correct position we get '-'. But if it is in the correct position, we get '✓'. So by putting R in a new position (say position 4) we are testing if it belongs there.

 Also note: we are trying to get the R's position.

 Therefore, I think ""SHIRT"" is a good word.

 But wait: what if R is actually in position 1? Then ""SHIRT"" would miss that because we put R in position 4. Similarly, we haven't tested position 1,3,5.

 However, we only get one guess and we must include R. We can test R at one new position per guess.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that includes R and also other letters that are common and we haven't tested. But note that we have an eliminated set now: {C, A, N, E}. We must avoid them.

 Given the above, I choose ""SHIRT"". 

 But to be complete, let me consider another word: ""ROBOT""? But O and also R is at position 1? But we haven't tested position 1. And it avoids A, C, N, E? Yes. However, it uses O twice (positions 2 and 4) and then B, T. So the double O reduces the information.

 So ""ROBOT"" tests fewer unique letters.

 Therefore, I think ""SHIRT"" is a solid choice.

 But wait: in ""SHIRT"", the letter I is in position 3. We haven't ruled out I.

 Alternatively, what about ""SHORT""? Avoided letters: S, H, O, R, T. But O is present. However, we haven't ruled out O. But note: the word ""SHORT"" has R at position 3? Actually: S (1), H (2), O (3), R (4) -> wait, no: the positions: 
   - S at 1, H at 2, O at 3, R at 4? Then R is at position 4 again? Actually, if we spell SHORT: S-H-O-R-T so R is at position 4? But then what? Same as SHIRT.

 Alternatively, ""ROOST"" has R at 1 but eliminates itself? Because we must avoid double letters? Actually, double O is allowed, but we may not get as much info. And it has R at 1, which is new.

 However, ""ROOST"" is a word? Yes, meaning of a pigeon perch.

 But again, double O. 

 Given the trade-off, I think ""SHIRT"" is acceptable.

 So I choose: ""SHIRT""

 Therefore, my guess is SHIRT.

 But note: what about ""BRISK""? We don't know B? We haven't eliminated B. And it has R at position 2? But wait: no, B-R-I-S-K: R is at position 2 -> we cannot because R must not be at position 2 (as per previous feedback). But in ""BRISK"", R is in the second position. Therefore, we cannot use that because we know that position 2 is wrong for R.

 So back to ""SHIRT"".

 Final decision: ""SHIRT""

After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N, E are **not** in the secret word (marked ❌).
- R is in the word but **not in position 2** (marked ➖).

For the next guess:
- Must include **R** (since it exists in the secret word) but avoid placing it in position 2 again.
- Avoid letters C, A, N, E entirely.
- Prioritize new common letters (e.g., S, T, H, I) to gather more information.

Selected **""SHIRT""** because:
- Places R in **position 4** (a new untested position for R).
- Uses S, H, I, T (common, untested consonants).
- Avoids eliminated letters (C, A, N, E) and repeated characters.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all are distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on our first guess: ""crane"" resulted in C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)
 From this feedback:
   - 'R' is present in the secret word but not in the correct position (because it got '-')
   - The other letters 'C', 'A', 'N', 'E' are not in the word at all (since they got 'x')

 So the secret word contains the letter 'R' (but not in the second position because in ""crane"", R is in the second position and it was marked wrong).

 Also, note that the secret word does not contain C, A, N, E.

 Since we have only found one letter so far (R) and it must be in a different position, we can think about words that have R but not in the second position, and avoid C, A, N, E.

 Given that we have 5 letters and 1 known letter (R) but not its position, we need to choose a word that:
   - Has the letter R (in a position that isn't the second one)
   - Does not contain C, A, N, E
   - Includes other common letters to maximize information.

 Also note: The secret word has 5 letters and R is one of them, so we have 4 more unknown letters.

 Let's consider common letters that are still possible: we can use B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 A good approach is to use a word that has R and other common letters, and place R in a position we haven't tried (so not position 2). We can put R in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 We also want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Let me consider words that start with R? But note: if we put R in position 1, then we can check if R is at the beginning. However, we don't have much information so maybe a word with R in the middle or end is fine.

 A common word that comes to mind: ""ROAST"" has R (first letter) and O, A, S, T. But A was already eliminated (because in the first guess, A was marked 'x'). So we cannot use A.

 Let me avoid A because it's eliminated.

 Possibilities: ""TRYST"", but that has T and Y. Also, we haven't eliminated T. But note: the word must be 5 letters and valid.

 Alternatively: ""DRYLY"" - but that repeats Y and isn't very informative.

 Another idea: ""POURS"" has P, O, U, R, S. But we don't know about O, U, S. Also, R is in the fourth position (if spelled P-O-U-R-S). So R is at position 4.

 However, note: we must not use eliminated letters: C, A, N, E. So ""POURS"" avoids these.

 Another common word: ""TRIES"" but E is eliminated so no.

 Similarly: ""GROSS"" - G, R, O, S, S. R is at position 2? But we already tried R at position 2 and it was wrong. So we cannot put R at position 2 again. So ""GROSS"" has R at position 2 -> not allowed because we know R is not in position 2.

 We need to pick a word where R is not in position 2.

 Let me look for a word that has R in a different position:

 Possibilities:
  - Position 1: R (then we get to check if it's at the start). Words: ROOMY? But O is not eliminated. However, ROOMY has double O and also Y. But also: note that ROOMY uses O twice and we don't know about O.

  Another word: ""ROWDY"" - R, O, W, D, Y. But again, O and we have to see.

  Position 3: Let's say ""TARES"" but A is eliminated -> no.

  Position 4: ""STARL"" not a word? ""STARE"" but E and A are out -> no.

  Position 5: ""LATER"" has A and E -> no.

 So let's try to avoid eliminated letters and put R in a new position.

 Here's an idea: ""POINT"" doesn't have R -> we must include R because we know it's in the word.

 Another: ""MORPH"" - M, O, R, P, H. R at position 3. And it doesn't use A, C, N, E. This seems okay.

 But wait, we don't know anything about O, but that's fine.

 Another candidate: ""SPRIG"" - S, P, R, I, G. R is at position 3? Actually, positions: S (1), P (2), R (3), I (4), G (5). So R is at position 3. This avoids the eliminated letters.

 Another: ""QUIRK"" - Q, U, I, R, K. R at position 4.

 However, we don't know about Q, U, I, K and so on.

 Considering commonality, words with more vowels might be better? But we know the word doesn't have A, E? Only vowels left are I, O, U, and sometimes Y.

 Let me list words: 
   - ""WORLD"" has W, O, R, L, D -> R at position 3. This word: W is common? Not as much as others. Also, O and L are common.

   - ""DOUBT"" doesn't have R -> skip.

   - ""BUILT"" doesn't have R -> skip.

   - ""PRISM"" - P, R, I, S, M -> R at the second position. But wait: P (1), R (2). But we had R at position 2 in ""crane"" and it was wrong, so we cannot put R in position 2.

   ""PRISM"" is invalid because R must not be at position 2.

 How about ""VIRUS""? V, I, R, U, S -> R at position 3? Actually: positions: V (1), I (2), R (3), U (4), S (5). So R at position 3. This avoids A, C, E, N and doesn't include repeated letters.

 This seems good.

 Another candidate: ""FRISK"" -> F, R, I, S, K. But R is at position 2? So R is at the second position -> not allowed.

 We must avoid position 2 for R.

 So ""VIRUS"" seems okay.

 Another word: ""TRULY"" -> T, R, U, L, Y -> R at position 2? No: T(1), R(2) -> again second position -> skip.

 What about ""SHIRT"" -> S, H, I, R, T -> R at position 4. And avoided eliminated letters? Yes: no A, C, E, N.

 So ""SHIRT"" is another candidate.

 We can also consider ""SPURT"" -> S, P, U, R, T -> R at position 4.

 But note: we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Since we have a limited number of guesses, we should prioritize words that include common consonants (like S, T, L, M, D, etc.) and vowels (like I, O, U).

 Among ""SHIRT"", ""SPURT"", ""VIRUS"" ... let's see:

 ""SHIRT"": S, H, I, R, T -> common letters: S, T are very common. H, I are also common.
 ""VIRUS"": V is less common.

 So maybe ""SHIRT"" is better because it uses more common letters.

 However, note: the feedback we got for the first word told us that R is present but not in position 2. In ""SHIRT"", R is in position 4. That's a new position we haven't tried. So if R is in position 4 in the secret word, then we will get a '-' again? Actually, wait: if R is not in the correct position we get '-'. But if it is in the correct position, we get '✓'. So by putting R in a new position (say position 4) we are testing if it belongs there.

 Also note: we are trying to get the R's position.

 Therefore, I think ""SHIRT"" is a good word.

 But wait: what if R is actually in position 1? Then ""SHIRT"" would miss that because we put R in position 4. Similarly, we haven't tested position 1,3,5.

 However, we only get one guess and we must include R. We can test R at one new position per guess.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that includes R and also other letters that are common and we haven't tested. But note that we have an eliminated set now: {C, A, N, E}. We must avoid them.

 Given the above, I choose ""SHIRT"". 

 But to be complete, let me consider another word: ""ROBOT""? But O and also R is at position 1? But we haven't tested position 1. And it avoids A, C, N, E? Yes. However, it uses O twice (positions 2 and 4) and then B, T. So the double O reduces the information.

 So ""ROBOT"" tests fewer unique letters.

 Therefore, I think ""SHIRT"" is a solid choice.

 But wait: in ""SHIRT"", the letter I is in position 3. We haven't ruled out I.

 Alternatively, what about ""SHORT""? Avoided letters: S, H, O, R, T. But O is present. However, we haven't ruled out O. But note: the word ""SHORT"" has R at position 3? Actually: S (1), H (2), O (3), R (4) -> wait, no: the positions: 
   - S at 1, H at 2, O at 3, R at 4? Then R is at position 4 again? Actually, if we spell SHORT: S-H-O-R-T so R is at position 4? But then what? Same as SHIRT.

 Alternatively, ""ROOST"" has R at 1 but eliminates itself? Because we must avoid double letters? Actually, double O is allowed, but we may not get as much info. And it has R at 1, which is new.

 However, ""ROOST"" is a word? Yes, meaning of a pigeon perch.

 But again, double O. 

 Given the trade-off, I think ""SHIRT"" is acceptable.

 So I choose: ""SHIRT""

 Therefore, my guess is SHIRT.

 But note: what about ""BRISK""? We don't know B? We haven't eliminated B. And it has R at position 2? But wait: no, B-R-I-S-K: R is at position 2 -> we cannot because R must not be at position 2 (as per previous feedback). But in ""BRISK"", R is in the second position. Therefore, we cannot use that because we know that position 2 is wrong for R.

 So back to ""SHIRT"".

 Final decision: ""SHIRT""

<guess>shirt</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N, E are **not** in the secret word (marked ❌).
- R is in the word but **not in position 2** (marked ➖).

For the next guess:
- Must include **R** (since it exists in the secret word) but avoid placing it in position 2 again.
- Avoid letters C, A, N, E entirely.
- Prioritize new common letters (e.g., S, T, H, I) to gather more information.

Selected **""SHIRT""** because:
- Places R in **position 4** (a new untested position for R).
- Uses S, H, I, T (common, untested consonants).
- Avoids eliminated letters (C, A, N, E) and repeated characters.
- Maximizes coverage of new letters to accelerate deduction.

We are given feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Meaning: 
  - R is in the word but not in position 2 (since it was at position 2 and marked -)
  - C, A, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: shirt -> S(x) H(x) I(x) R(✓) T(x)
Meaning:
  - R is in the word and in the correct position. Since R was in position 4 in ""shirt"", that means the secret word has R at position 4.
  - S, H, I, T are not in the word (all marked x).

Therefore, we know:
  - The secret word has R in position 4.
  - The word does not contain any of: C, A, N, E, S, H, I, T.

Additionally, from the first guess, we know R is present and now we know exactly where (position 4).

We must use only letters that have not been eliminated: all letters except C, A, N, E, S, H, I, T.

What letters are left?
Alphabet minus eliminated: so letters available: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We are missing 5 letters, but we already know the fourth letter is R.

So the secret word pattern: _ _ _ R _

Now, the word must be composed from the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We have not used any letters in positions 1, 2, 3, and 5.

We need to form a valid English word.

Also remember that R is fixed at position 4.

Let's think of common words that fit this pattern.

Possibilities:
- Words ending with R: and the third letter must be one of the available.

Since R is the fourth letter, the word ends with one letter after R? So the last letter is position 5.

Words: 
  - ???R? 

Examples:
 - UMBRELLA: too long, not 5 letters.
 - Focus on 5-letter words.

Common 5-letter words with R at position 4:

Let me recall:
- FLORA? Letters: F,L,O,R,A -> but A is eliminated -> no.
- GROUP? G,R,O,U,P -> R is at position 3? G(1),R(2),O(3),U(4),P(5) -> no, R at 4? That would be letter4: U? Not R.

Position 4 is R. So the word is ...R. meaning the fourth character is R.

Examples:
- WATER: W,A,T,E,R -> R at position 5 -> no, that's fifth.
- TAPER: T,A,P,E,R -> R at 5 -> no.

Words with R as the fourth letter? That means the word ends with R? but wait: positions 1,2,3,R,5.

So the word is of the form: XXXR? where ? is one letter.

Actually, the fifth letter is still free.

So let's think:

- MANOR: M,A,N,O,R -> but A and N are eliminated -> no.
- MAYOR: M,A,Y,O,R -> A eliminated -> no.
- MINOR: M,I,N,O,R -> I and N eliminated -> no.

From available letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

So:
- FLOOR? F,L,O,O,R -> but R is position 5 -> no, positions: F(1), L(2), O(3), O(4) ... so R would be the fifth? Then it doesn't have R at 4.

We need letter 4 to be R.

So:
- Words: ... in position 4 is R, then a fifth letter.

Example: ""BURP"": not 5 letters.

5-letter words: 
- ROBOT -> R,O,B,O,T -> but R at position 1 -> no.
- FROZE? F,R,O,Z,E -> but E and also R is at position 2 -> no.

Perhaps ""MOURN"": M,O,U,R,N -> letters: M(1),O(2),U(3),R(4),N(5). But N is eliminated -> no.

""COURT"": C,O,U,R,T -> C and T eliminated -> no.

""POURS"": P,O,U,R,S -> but S eliminated -> no.

""LOURS"": L,O,U,R,S -> S eliminated -> no.

So let's try to avoid eliminated letters. How about:

""FOLDR"" not a word.

""MOULD? How about ""MOURY""? Not a word.

Another: ""DEARY"" D,E,A,R,Y -> E and A eliminated -> no.

We are constrained by eliminated letters.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Words with pattern ??R? are actually: the R is at the fourth position, so positions 1,2,3 are any consonant or vowel from the allowed set, and position 5 is from the set.

Common words:

- FORUM? F,O,R,U,M -> R at position 3? O is position 2 -> no.

We need R at position 4: so the word structure: [1][2][3]R[5]

For example: 
- ""PURR"" is only 4 letters -> no.

Longer: 
- ""MURKY"" -> M,U,R,K,Y -> R at position 3? M(1),U(2),R(3) -> no.

- ""LURED"" -> L,U,R,E,D -> E eliminated -> no.

- ""BURLY"" -> B,U,R,L,Y -> R at position 3? B(1),U(2),R(3), so wrong.

Alternatively: ""MANOR"" we had, but A and N out.

Wait, we have to have letters in the third position that are available. So what about:

- with O? ""ODOR"" too short.

Another: ""LEVER"" E is out.

Perhaps ""MORPH"" -> M,O,R,P,H? But R at position 3? M(1),O(2),R(3) -> no.

We need R at position 4. So the word should be something like: 

- ""FORTY"": F,O,R,T,Y -> but F(1), O(2), R(3) -> no, R is at 3.

- ""WORRY"": W,O,R,R,Y -> R at 3 and 4, but T and W? W(1),O(2),R(3),R(4),Y(5). So here, R is at 4? Positions: 
   1: W
   2: O
   3: R
   4: R? Then position 4 is the second R? So it would be R at position 3 and 4.

Wait: if the word is ""WORRY"", then:
   Position 1: W
   Position 2: O
   Position 3: R
   Position 4: R
However, we don't have two R positions necessarily.

But in our case, we want the fourth letter to be R? But in WORRY, the third and fourth are R? Then position 4 is R? That's correct? So WORRY has an R at position 4? Actually: 
   W (1), O (2), R (3), R (4), because the double R: the fourth letter is the second R?

Yes: WORRY -> positions: 1:W, 2:O, 3:R, 4:R. So position 4 is R and position 3 is also R.

So WORRY has R at position 4? Yes.

But note: we have R at both positions 3 and 4. But the word has two R's? So that is allowed.

Now check letters: W, O, R, R, Y.

Elimination list: C, A, N, E, S, H, I, T. So W, O, R, Y are all available? Y is available? Yes? Also R we know is present.

However, we used H in shirt and it was eliminated? Is R allowed? Yes, R is in the word and we know it.

But the letter R is already known. So WORRY uses R at position 4 and position 3? That is okay.

But the letters: 
   W: not eliminated? 
   O: not eliminated?
   Y: not eliminated?

So WORRY is a candidate.

But note: position 3 is R, and we can have that? Yes, because we are allowed double letters? In fact, the secret word might have double letters.

Now, but in the feedback for ""shirt"", we got R in position 4 correct. But we don't know if there is another R?

So WORRY: W, O, R, R, Y -> and R is at position 4? Yes.

Another candidate: ""FUROR"": F,U,R,O,R -> positions: F(1), U(2), R(3), O(4), R(5) -> O at position4? Not R.

How about ""RUPEE"": not available because E eliminated.

Another: ""PUKER""? P,U,K,E,R -> E eliminated -> no.

""DOZER"": E -> no.

""ROVER"": R,O,V,E,R -> E -> no.

""GOURD"": G,O,U,R,D -> positions: G(1), O(2), U(3), R(4), D(5). Perfect: position4 is R. And letters are: G,O,U,R,D -> avoid C,A,N,E,S,H,I,T? Yes: G,O,U,D not eliminated.

So ""GOURD"" is a valid word? Yes.

Similarly, ""FOUR"": too short.

Also ""JOURD"" not a word? Probably not.

""WOUND"": W,O,U,N,D -> N eliminated -> no.

So we have:
  - WORRY: W, O, R, R, Y -> common? But double R.
  - GOURD: G, O, U, R, D -> no double letters? Actually single R? GOURD has R at position 4: 
      Position 1: G
      Position 2: O
      Position 3: U
      Position 4: R
      Position 5: D

And G, O, U, R, D: all allowed.

Another: ""BOUND"": B,O,U,N,D -> N eliminated -> no.

""POUND"": P,O,U,N,D -> N eliminated.

""FOUND"": same.

So another possibility: ""COURT"" eliminated.

""MOURN"" eliminated.

""GROUP"" has R at position 2? Not.

But ""PURRE"" not a word.

Another common word: ""FLAIR""? F,L,A,I,R -> A and I eliminated.

Let's think: ""MURKY"" has R at position 3 -> not.

Or ""CURED"": eliminated letters.

So I found GOURD and WORRY.

Also: ""DOUR""... no, only four letters? ""DURRY"" not a word.

""YOUR"" is four.

Another: ""QUERY"": Q,U,E,R,Y -> E eliminated -> no.

""QUORUM"": too long.

""GUARD"": G,U,A,R,D -> A eliminated -> no.

Therefore, two strong candidates: GOURD and WORRY.

But we need to choose one. We don't know if there is a double letter. So let me choose one that tests new letters.

In WORRY: letters W, O, R, R, Y -> so we test W, O, Y and also the double R? But R we know already, and we are testing if position 3 is R? Or if the fifth letter is Y.

In GOURD: G, O, U, R, D -> tests G, O, U, D.

But in the secret word, we have position 4=R fixed, so position 3: either we guess U (for GOURD) or R (for WORRY).

We don't know which.

But note: we have not tried any letter now except R. We are going to test new letters.

Since in WORRY we use R again at position 3, then if the secret word doesn't have R at 3 but we get a minus? Suppose the word is GOURD. Then if we guess WORRY:
  - W: not in GOURD? so x?
  - O: is in GOURD? position 2: O? GOURD: G, O, U, R, D -> O at position 2. In WORRY, O is at position 2? WORRY: W (1), O (2), R (3), R (4), Y (5). So if we guess WORRY and the word is GOURD:
      Position1: W -> x (not in GOURD) 
      Position2: O -> correct? Because GOURD has O at position2? No, GOURD: position2 is O? Then it would be O (✓) but in FEEDBACK? Wait:

Secret word: G O U R D

Guess: W O R R Y

- W: not in the word -> x?
- O: in the word and at position2? Correct -> ✓
- R: in the word? But the secret word has R at position4? The R in guess position3 is R? But secret does not have R at position3 -> but R is in the word, so -
- R: at position4? Correct -> ✓? 
- Y: not in the word? So x.

BUT: the secret word has only one R? But we used two R's: so the feedback might be:

For the first R: in position3 -> since the secret has an R at position4? It's not at 3? So '-'. And the second R (position4) is in the same place? So '✓'.

But we also have the letter O that matches.

But if we guess GOURD and the word is GOURD, then all correct.

But we don't know.

To maximize information, we could choose a word without double letters? So we cover more distinct letters.

Therefore, GOURD might be better because it tests G, O, U, D (new distinct letters) and R.

WORRY repeats R so we get same letter tested again? But we already know R? So testing additional letters may be preferable.

So to cover more letters:  GOURD: tests G, O, U, D.

WORRY: tests W, O, Y and R again (double).

Since O appears in both? We test O? But in WORRY, O is tested? Position2? 

Also, let's see:

We haven't tested G, D, U, W, Y.

But WORRY tests W, O, Y? And GOURD tests G, O, U, D.

We also might consider other words? We can list:

Words matching pattern with available letters:

Letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Pattern: ???R?

Examples (scrabble words?) 

- FORMS: F,O,R,M,S -> but S eliminated -> no.
- GOURD: yes.
- WORRY: yes? But WORRY is valid.
- BOORS: B,O,O,R,S -> S eliminated -> no.
- DOGRO: Not a word.
- FUMED: E eliminated? Only D? F,U,M,E,D -> E -> no.
- GLORY: G,L,O,R,Y -> L and Y available? And L not eliminated? But pattern: we need position4=R? GLORY: G(1),L(2),O(3),R(4),Y(5). Perfect? And letters: G, L, O, Y are available.

GLORY: 
  G: yes
  L: yes
  O: yes
  Y: yes

Is GLORY a word? Yes.

Another: ""GROWY"" not a word.

So we have three candidates:
  - GOURD: G,O,U,R,D
  - WORRY: W,O,R,R,Y
  - GLORY: G,L,O,R,Y

Now, GLORY avoids double letters? Yes.

And we haven't tested L and Y? So GLORY tests G, L, O, R, Y.

But R we already know? So we get information on G, L, O, Y.

Similarly, GOURD tests G,O,U,R,D.

We need to pick one. Which one tests more common letters? 

GLORY uses L and Y? L common, Y less so.

GOURD uses U, D? U vowel? Common? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can also consider ""FJORD"": F,J,O,R,D -> valid? Yes, but J is less common? And F available? Pattern: F(1),J(2),O(3),R(4),D(5). So that works? But J is not common and we might avoid it.

Another word: ""OPTRY""? no.

""ROWDY"": R,O,W,D,Y -> R at position1? Not position4. Skip.

Given the above, I think GLORY is a good candidate? But let's see: we don't know O? We haven't tested O? Yes O is not eliminated.

So why not GLORY? 

But note: in GOURD we have U? Also the position of O? In GLORY O is at position 3? In GOURD O is at position 2? 

We haven't tested O anywhere, so both GLORY and GOURD test O? At different positions.

In GLORY: O is at position3? Then if the secret word has O at position3, we get '-' if not? But we have no information on O.

How about choosing GLORY? Since L is very common, it might yield more information.

But note: we have 6 tries, so we can guess.

Alternatively: we might not need to use all uncommon letters? But GLORY has G which is common? Well, not as much.

Another option: ""MORAY"": M,O,R,A,Y -> A eliminated -> no.

""VOULU"" not a word.

So between GLORY and GOURD? 

How about ""DOUBT""? D,O,U,B,T -> T eliminated -> no. T was eliminated in feedback of ""shirt"".

T is eliminated.

Now, in GOURD: positions: G (new, test pos1), O (new, pos2), U (new, pos3), R (known, pos4), D (new, pos5).

In GLORY: G (new, pos1), L (new, pos2), O (new, pos3), R (known, pos4), Y (new, pos5).

Both are good? 

But we have U available? Also we have not tested U.

I think we can pick GLORY to test L? Or GOURD to test U?

Given that vowels are more constrained? We only have O, U, Y? So testing a vowel could be useful? U is a vowel.

But Y in GLORY? Both vowels.

But GLORY tests L? Which is a common consonant.

However, I recall that we eliminated A, E, I? The vowels we have left are O, U, Y.

Therefore, maybe words with O or U are worth testing? 

But GOURD has both O and U? GLORY has O and Y? 

Since U is more common than Y? Perhaps GOURD is better.

But GLORY uses Y? Which may appear in few words? So testing U might be better? 

However, note: the secret word must have 5 letters and we have R at position4.

We can look for additional words? 

Another word: ""PODGY"" not a word.

""AURUM"" not available.

""FURRY"": F,U,R,R,Y -> R at positions 3 and 4? Pattern: F(1),U(2),R(3),R(4),Y(5). And R is known? So letters F,U,Y? The R repetition.

But F,U,Y available. Pattern: same as WORRY? 

Here: ... but WORRY we considered.

Given that, I think GOURD is a solid choice? Because it tests O at position2 and U at position3? And G and D? Also, we know O is in the word then? Not necessarily? We don't know if O is in the word.

But by guessing O in GOURD, we can see if O is present? 

Similarly, in GLORY we test O? 

But GLORY tests L? which might not be in many words? Wait no, L is common.

Given the dictionary, GUORD  and GLORY are both reasonable.

But let me choose one: GOURD? Because U has not been tried and might be common? 

But I think it is fine.

So I choose GOURD.

But wait: are we allowed GOURD? Yes.

Alternatively, ""FOCUS"" not matching pattern? 

Or ""JUMPS"" S eliminated.

So GOURD: guess.

Final decision: GOURD

Let me write: <guess>gourd</guess>

But note: we know position4=R and only 6 tries? This could be the actual word? Or not.

So we'll see.

<guess>gourd</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- From **crane**: R is in the secret word but NOT in position 2, and C, A, N, E are NOT in the word.
- From **shirt**: R is in position 4 (correctly placed), and S, H, I, T are NOT in the word.

Thus, the secret word:
- Must have R in position 4 (pattern: `_ _ _ R _`).
- Cannot contain C, A, N, E, S, H, I, T (eliminated letters).
- Must use remaining letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

After evaluating possible words that fit the pattern and avoid eliminated letters (e.g., GOURD positions G(1), O(2), U(3), R(4), D(5)), ""GOURD"" was selected because:
- It tests new common letters (O, U) and consonants (G, D).
- Positions O(2) and U(3) provide critical information on placement of vowels/known absent letters.
- Avoids eliminated letters and maximizes coverage of untested characters (O is a high-frequency vowel).

<guess>gourd</guess>",gourd,"We are given feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Meaning: 
  - R is in the word but not in position 2 (since it was at position 2 and marked -)
  - C, A, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: shirt -> S(x) H(x) I(x) R(✓) T(x)
Meaning:
  - R is in the word and in the correct position. Since R was in position 4 in ""shirt"", that means the secret word has R at position 4.
  - S, H, I, T are not in the word (all marked x).

Therefore, we know:
  - The secret word has R in position 4.
  - The word does not contain any of: C, A, N, E, S, H, I, T.

Additionally, from the first guess, we know R is present and now we know exactly where (position 4).

We must use only letters that have not been eliminated: all letters except C, A, N, E, S, H, I, T.

What letters are left?
Alphabet minus eliminated: so letters available: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We are missing 5 letters, but we already know the fourth letter is R.

So the secret word pattern: _ _ _ R _

Now, the word must be composed from the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We have not used any letters in positions 1, 2, 3, and 5.

We need to form a valid English word.

Also remember that R is fixed at position 4.

Let's think of common words that fit this pattern.

Possibilities:
- Words ending with R: and the third letter must be one of the available.

Since R is the fourth letter, the word ends with one letter after R? So the last letter is position 5.

Words: 
  - ???R? 

Examples:
 - UMBRELLA: too long, not 5 letters.
 - Focus on 5-letter words.

Common 5-letter words with R at position 4:

Let me recall:
- FLORA? Letters: F,L,O,R,A -> but A is eliminated -> no.
- GROUP? G,R,O,U,P -> R is at position 3? G(1),R(2),O(3),U(4),P(5) -> no, R at 4? That would be letter4: U? Not R.

Position 4 is R. So the word is ...R. meaning the fourth character is R.

Examples:
- WATER: W,A,T,E,R -> R at position 5 -> no, that's fifth.
- TAPER: T,A,P,E,R -> R at 5 -> no.

Words with R as the fourth letter? That means the word ends with R? but wait: positions 1,2,3,R,5.

So the word is of the form: XXXR? where ? is one letter.

Actually, the fifth letter is still free.

So let's think:

- MANOR: M,A,N,O,R -> but A and N are eliminated -> no.
- MAYOR: M,A,Y,O,R -> A eliminated -> no.
- MINOR: M,I,N,O,R -> I and N eliminated -> no.

From available letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

So:
- FLOOR? F,L,O,O,R -> but R is position 5 -> no, positions: F(1), L(2), O(3), O(4) ... so R would be the fifth? Then it doesn't have R at 4.

We need letter 4 to be R.

So:
- Words: ... in position 4 is R, then a fifth letter.

Example: ""BURP"": not 5 letters.

5-letter words: 
- ROBOT -> R,O,B,O,T -> but R at position 1 -> no.
- FROZE? F,R,O,Z,E -> but E and also R is at position 2 -> no.

Perhaps ""MOURN"": M,O,U,R,N -> letters: M(1),O(2),U(3),R(4),N(5). But N is eliminated -> no.

""COURT"": C,O,U,R,T -> C and T eliminated -> no.

""POURS"": P,O,U,R,S -> but S eliminated -> no.

""LOURS"": L,O,U,R,S -> S eliminated -> no.

So let's try to avoid eliminated letters. How about:

""FOLDR"" not a word.

""MOULD? How about ""MOURY""? Not a word.

Another: ""DEARY"" D,E,A,R,Y -> E and A eliminated -> no.

We are constrained by eliminated letters.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Words with pattern ??R? are actually: the R is at the fourth position, so positions 1,2,3 are any consonant or vowel from the allowed set, and position 5 is from the set.

Common words:

- FORUM? F,O,R,U,M -> R at position 3? O is position 2 -> no.

We need R at position 4: so the word structure: [1][2][3]R[5]

For example: 
- ""PURR"" is only 4 letters -> no.

Longer: 
- ""MURKY"" -> M,U,R,K,Y -> R at position 3? M(1),U(2),R(3) -> no.

- ""LURED"" -> L,U,R,E,D -> E eliminated -> no.

- ""BURLY"" -> B,U,R,L,Y -> R at position 3? B(1),U(2),R(3), so wrong.

Alternatively: ""MANOR"" we had, but A and N out.

Wait, we have to have letters in the third position that are available. So what about:

- with O? ""ODOR"" too short.

Another: ""LEVER"" E is out.

Perhaps ""MORPH"" -> M,O,R,P,H? But R at position 3? M(1),O(2),R(3) -> no.

We need R at position 4. So the word should be something like: 

- ""FORTY"": F,O,R,T,Y -> but F(1), O(2), R(3) -> no, R is at 3.

- ""WORRY"": W,O,R,R,Y -> R at 3 and 4, but T and W? W(1),O(2),R(3),R(4),Y(5). So here, R is at 4? Positions: 
   1: W
   2: O
   3: R
   4: R? Then position 4 is the second R? So it would be R at position 3 and 4.

Wait: if the word is ""WORRY"", then:
   Position 1: W
   Position 2: O
   Position 3: R
   Position 4: R
However, we don't have two R positions necessarily.

But in our case, we want the fourth letter to be R? But in WORRY, the third and fourth are R? Then position 4 is R? That's correct? So WORRY has an R at position 4? Actually: 
   W (1), O (2), R (3), R (4), because the double R: the fourth letter is the second R?

Yes: WORRY -> positions: 1:W, 2:O, 3:R, 4:R. So position 4 is R and position 3 is also R.

So WORRY has R at position 4? Yes.

But note: we have R at both positions 3 and 4. But the word has two R's? So that is allowed.

Now check letters: W, O, R, R, Y.

Elimination list: C, A, N, E, S, H, I, T. So W, O, R, Y are all available? Y is available? Yes? Also R we know is present.

However, we used H in shirt and it was eliminated? Is R allowed? Yes, R is in the word and we know it.

But the letter R is already known. So WORRY uses R at position 4 and position 3? That is okay.

But the letters: 
   W: not eliminated? 
   O: not eliminated?
   Y: not eliminated?

So WORRY is a candidate.

But note: position 3 is R, and we can have that? Yes, because we are allowed double letters? In fact, the secret word might have double letters.

Now, but in the feedback for ""shirt"", we got R in position 4 correct. But we don't know if there is another R?

So WORRY: W, O, R, R, Y -> and R is at position 4? Yes.

Another candidate: ""FUROR"": F,U,R,O,R -> positions: F(1), U(2), R(3), O(4), R(5) -> O at position4? Not R.

How about ""RUPEE"": not available because E eliminated.

Another: ""PUKER""? P,U,K,E,R -> E eliminated -> no.

""DOZER"": E -> no.

""ROVER"": R,O,V,E,R -> E -> no.

""GOURD"": G,O,U,R,D -> positions: G(1), O(2), U(3), R(4), D(5). Perfect: position4 is R. And letters are: G,O,U,R,D -> avoid C,A,N,E,S,H,I,T? Yes: G,O,U,D not eliminated.

So ""GOURD"" is a valid word? Yes.

Similarly, ""FOUR"": too short.

Also ""JOURD"" not a word? Probably not.

""WOUND"": W,O,U,N,D -> N eliminated -> no.

So we have:
  - WORRY: W, O, R, R, Y -> common? But double R.
  - GOURD: G, O, U, R, D -> no double letters? Actually single R? GOURD has R at position 4: 
      Position 1: G
      Position 2: O
      Position 3: U
      Position 4: R
      Position 5: D

And G, O, U, R, D: all allowed.

Another: ""BOUND"": B,O,U,N,D -> N eliminated -> no.

""POUND"": P,O,U,N,D -> N eliminated.

""FOUND"": same.

So another possibility: ""COURT"" eliminated.

""MOURN"" eliminated.

""GROUP"" has R at position 2? Not.

But ""PURRE"" not a word.

Another common word: ""FLAIR""? F,L,A,I,R -> A and I eliminated.

Let's think: ""MURKY"" has R at position 3 -> not.

Or ""CURED"": eliminated letters.

So I found GOURD and WORRY.

Also: ""DOUR""... no, only four letters? ""DURRY"" not a word.

""YOUR"" is four.

Another: ""QUERY"": Q,U,E,R,Y -> E eliminated -> no.

""QUORUM"": too long.

""GUARD"": G,U,A,R,D -> A eliminated -> no.

Therefore, two strong candidates: GOURD and WORRY.

But we need to choose one. We don't know if there is a double letter. So let me choose one that tests new letters.

In WORRY: letters W, O, R, R, Y -> so we test W, O, Y and also the double R? But R we know already, and we are testing if position 3 is R? Or if the fifth letter is Y.

In GOURD: G, O, U, R, D -> tests G, O, U, D.

But in the secret word, we have position 4=R fixed, so position 3: either we guess U (for GOURD) or R (for WORRY).

We don't know which.

But note: we have not tried any letter now except R. We are going to test new letters.

Since in WORRY we use R again at position 3, then if the secret word doesn't have R at 3 but we get a minus? Suppose the word is GOURD. Then if we guess WORRY:
  - W: not in GOURD? so x?
  - O: is in GOURD? position 2: O? GOURD: G, O, U, R, D -> O at position 2. In WORRY, O is at position 2? WORRY: W (1), O (2), R (3), R (4), Y (5). So if we guess WORRY and the word is GOURD:
      Position1: W -> x (not in GOURD) 
      Position2: O -> correct? Because GOURD has O at position2? No, GOURD: position2 is O? Then it would be O (✓) but in FEEDBACK? Wait:

Secret word: G O U R D

Guess: W O R R Y

- W: not in the word -> x?
- O: in the word and at position2? Correct -> ✓
- R: in the word? But the secret word has R at position4? The R in guess position3 is R? But secret does not have R at position3 -> but R is in the word, so -
- R: at position4? Correct -> ✓? 
- Y: not in the word? So x.

BUT: the secret word has only one R? But we used two R's: so the feedback might be:

For the first R: in position3 -> since the secret has an R at position4? It's not at 3? So '-'. And the second R (position4) is in the same place? So '✓'.

But we also have the letter O that matches.

But if we guess GOURD and the word is GOURD, then all correct.

But we don't know.

To maximize information, we could choose a word without double letters? So we cover more distinct letters.

Therefore, GOURD might be better because it tests G, O, U, D (new distinct letters) and R.

WORRY repeats R so we get same letter tested again? But we already know R? So testing additional letters may be preferable.

So to cover more letters:  GOURD: tests G, O, U, D.

WORRY: tests W, O, Y and R again (double).

Since O appears in both? We test O? But in WORRY, O is tested? Position2? 

Also, let's see:

We haven't tested G, D, U, W, Y.

But WORRY tests W, O, Y? And GOURD tests G, O, U, D.

We also might consider other words? We can list:

Words matching pattern with available letters:

Letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Pattern: ???R?

Examples (scrabble words?) 

- FORMS: F,O,R,M,S -> but S eliminated -> no.
- GOURD: yes.
- WORRY: yes? But WORRY is valid.
- BOORS: B,O,O,R,S -> S eliminated -> no.
- DOGRO: Not a word.
- FUMED: E eliminated? Only D? F,U,M,E,D -> E -> no.
- GLORY: G,L,O,R,Y -> L and Y available? And L not eliminated? But pattern: we need position4=R? GLORY: G(1),L(2),O(3),R(4),Y(5). Perfect? And letters: G, L, O, Y are available.

GLORY: 
  G: yes
  L: yes
  O: yes
  Y: yes

Is GLORY a word? Yes.

Another: ""GROWY"" not a word.

So we have three candidates:
  - GOURD: G,O,U,R,D
  - WORRY: W,O,R,R,Y
  - GLORY: G,L,O,R,Y

Now, GLORY avoids double letters? Yes.

And we haven't tested L and Y? So GLORY tests G, L, O, R, Y.

But R we already know? So we get information on G, L, O, Y.

Similarly, GOURD tests G,O,U,R,D.

We need to pick one. Which one tests more common letters? 

GLORY uses L and Y? L common, Y less so.

GOURD uses U, D? U vowel? Common? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can also consider ""FJORD"": F,J,O,R,D -> valid? Yes, but J is less common? And F available? Pattern: F(1),J(2),O(3),R(4),D(5). So that works? But J is not common and we might avoid it.

Another word: ""OPTRY""? no.

""ROWDY"": R,O,W,D,Y -> R at position1? Not position4. Skip.

Given the above, I think GLORY is a good candidate? But let's see: we don't know O? We haven't tested O? Yes O is not eliminated.

So why not GLORY? 

But note: in GOURD we have U? Also the position of O? In GLORY O is at position 3? In GOURD O is at position 2? 

We haven't tested O anywhere, so both GLORY and GOURD test O? At different positions.

In GLORY: O is at position3? Then if the secret word has O at position3, we get '-' if not? But we have no information on O.

How about choosing GLORY? Since L is very common, it might yield more information.

But note: we have 6 tries, so we can guess.

Alternatively: we might not need to use all uncommon letters? But GLORY has G which is common? Well, not as much.

Another option: ""MORAY"": M,O,R,A,Y -> A eliminated -> no.

""VOULU"" not a word.

So between GLORY and GOURD? 

How about ""DOUBT""? D,O,U,B,T -> T eliminated -> no. T was eliminated in feedback of ""shirt"".

T is eliminated.

Now, in GOURD: positions: G (new, test pos1), O (new, pos2), U (new, pos3), R (known, pos4), D (new, pos5).

In GLORY: G (new, pos1), L (new, pos2), O (new, pos3), R (known, pos4), Y (new, pos5).

Both are good? 

But we have U available? Also we have not tested U.

I think we can pick GLORY to test L? Or GOURD to test U?

Given that vowels are more constrained? We only have O, U, Y? So testing a vowel could be useful? U is a vowel.

But Y in GLORY? Both vowels.

But GLORY tests L? Which is a common consonant.

However, I recall that we eliminated A, E, I? The vowels we have left are O, U, Y.

Therefore, maybe words with O or U are worth testing? 

But GOURD has both O and U? GLORY has O and Y? 

Since U is more common than Y? Perhaps GOURD is better.

But GLORY uses Y? Which may appear in few words? So testing U might be better? 

However, note: the secret word must have 5 letters and we have R at position4.

We can look for additional words? 

Another word: ""PODGY"" not a word.

""AURUM"" not available.

""FURRY"": F,U,R,R,Y -> R at positions 3 and 4? Pattern: F(1),U(2),R(3),R(4),Y(5). And R is known? So letters F,U,Y? The R repetition.

But F,U,Y available. Pattern: same as WORRY? 

Here: ... but WORRY we considered.

Given that, I think GOURD is a solid choice? Because it tests O at position2 and U at position3? And G and D? Also, we know O is in the word then? Not necessarily? We don't know if O is in the word.

But by guessing O in GOURD, we can see if O is present? 

Similarly, in GLORY we test O? 

But GLORY tests L? which might not be in many words? Wait no, L is common.

Given the dictionary, GUORD  and GLORY are both reasonable.

But let me choose one: GOURD? Because U has not been tried and might be common? 

But I think it is fine.

So I choose GOURD.

But wait: are we allowed GOURD? Yes.

Alternatively, ""FOCUS"" not matching pattern? 

Or ""JUMPS"" S eliminated.

So GOURD: guess.

Final decision: GOURD

Let me write: <guess>gourd</guess>

But note: we know position4=R and only 6 tries? This could be the actual word? Or not.

So we'll see.

<guess>gourd</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- From **crane**: R is in the secret word but NOT in position 2, and C, A, N, E are NOT in the word.
- From **shirt**: R is in position 4 (correctly placed), and S, H, I, T are NOT in the word.

Thus, the secret word:
- Must have R in position 4 (pattern: `_ _ _ R _`).
- Cannot contain C, A, N, E, S, H, I, T (eliminated letters).
- Must use remaining letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

After evaluating possible words that fit the pattern and avoid eliminated letters (e.g., GOURD positions G(1), O(2), U(3), R(4), D(5)), ""GOURD"" was selected because:
- It tests new common letters (O, U) and consonants (G, D).
- Positions O(2) and U(3) provide critical information on placement of vowels/known absent letters.
- Avoids eliminated letters and maximizes coverage of untested characters (O is a high-frequency vowel).",Guess 3: gourd -> FEEDBACK: G(x) O(✓) U(x) R(✓) D(-),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all are distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on our first guess: ""crane"" resulted in C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)
 From this feedback:
   - 'R' is present in the secret word but not in the correct position (because it got '-')
   - The other letters 'C', 'A', 'N', 'E' are not in the word at all (since they got 'x')

 So the secret word contains the letter 'R' (but not in the second position because in ""crane"", R is in the second position and it was marked wrong).

 Also, note that the secret word does not contain C, A, N, E.

 Since we have only found one letter so far (R) and it must be in a different position, we can think about words that have R but not in the second position, and avoid C, A, N, E.

 Given that we have 5 letters and 1 known letter (R) but not its position, we need to choose a word that:
   - Has the letter R (in a position that isn't the second one)
   - Does not contain C, A, N, E
   - Includes other common letters to maximize information.

 Also note: The secret word has 5 letters and R is one of them, so we have 4 more unknown letters.

 Let's consider common letters that are still possible: we can use B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 A good approach is to use a word that has R and other common letters, and place R in a position we haven't tried (so not position 2). We can put R in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 We also want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Let me consider words that start with R? But note: if we put R in position 1, then we can check if R is at the beginning. However, we don't have much information so maybe a word with R in the middle or end is fine.

 A common word that comes to mind: ""ROAST"" has R (first letter) and O, A, S, T. But A was already eliminated (because in the first guess, A was marked 'x'). So we cannot use A.

 Let me avoid A because it's eliminated.

 Possibilities: ""TRYST"", but that has T and Y. Also, we haven't eliminated T. But note: the word must be 5 letters and valid.

 Alternatively: ""DRYLY"" - but that repeats Y and isn't very informative.

 Another idea: ""POURS"" has P, O, U, R, S. But we don't know about O, U, S. Also, R is in the fourth position (if spelled P-O-U-R-S). So R is at position 4.

 However, note: we must not use eliminated letters: C, A, N, E. So ""POURS"" avoids these.

 Another common word: ""TRIES"" but E is eliminated so no.

 Similarly: ""GROSS"" - G, R, O, S, S. R is at position 2? But we already tried R at position 2 and it was wrong. So we cannot put R at position 2 again. So ""GROSS"" has R at position 2 -> not allowed because we know R is not in position 2.

 We need to pick a word where R is not in position 2.

 Let me look for a word that has R in a different position:

 Possibilities:
  - Position 1: R (then we get to check if it's at the start). Words: ROOMY? But O is not eliminated. However, ROOMY has double O and also Y. But also: note that ROOMY uses O twice and we don't know about O.

  Another word: ""ROWDY"" - R, O, W, D, Y. But again, O and we have to see.

  Position 3: Let's say ""TARES"" but A is eliminated -> no.

  Position 4: ""STARL"" not a word? ""STARE"" but E and A are out -> no.

  Position 5: ""LATER"" has A and E -> no.

 So let's try to avoid eliminated letters and put R in a new position.

 Here's an idea: ""POINT"" doesn't have R -> we must include R because we know it's in the word.

 Another: ""MORPH"" - M, O, R, P, H. R at position 3. And it doesn't use A, C, N, E. This seems okay.

 But wait, we don't know anything about O, but that's fine.

 Another candidate: ""SPRIG"" - S, P, R, I, G. R is at position 3? Actually, positions: S (1), P (2), R (3), I (4), G (5). So R is at position 3. This avoids the eliminated letters.

 Another: ""QUIRK"" - Q, U, I, R, K. R at position 4.

 However, we don't know about Q, U, I, K and so on.

 Considering commonality, words with more vowels might be better? But we know the word doesn't have A, E? Only vowels left are I, O, U, and sometimes Y.

 Let me list words: 
   - ""WORLD"" has W, O, R, L, D -> R at position 3. This word: W is common? Not as much as others. Also, O and L are common.

   - ""DOUBT"" doesn't have R -> skip.

   - ""BUILT"" doesn't have R -> skip.

   - ""PRISM"" - P, R, I, S, M -> R at the second position. But wait: P (1), R (2). But we had R at position 2 in ""crane"" and it was wrong, so we cannot put R in position 2.

   ""PRISM"" is invalid because R must not be at position 2.

 How about ""VIRUS""? V, I, R, U, S -> R at position 3? Actually: positions: V (1), I (2), R (3), U (4), S (5). So R at position 3. This avoids A, C, E, N and doesn't include repeated letters.

 This seems good.

 Another candidate: ""FRISK"" -> F, R, I, S, K. But R is at position 2? So R is at the second position -> not allowed.

 We must avoid position 2 for R.

 So ""VIRUS"" seems okay.

 Another word: ""TRULY"" -> T, R, U, L, Y -> R at position 2? No: T(1), R(2) -> again second position -> skip.

 What about ""SHIRT"" -> S, H, I, R, T -> R at position 4. And avoided eliminated letters? Yes: no A, C, E, N.

 So ""SHIRT"" is another candidate.

 We can also consider ""SPURT"" -> S, P, U, R, T -> R at position 4.

 But note: we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Since we have a limited number of guesses, we should prioritize words that include common consonants (like S, T, L, M, D, etc.) and vowels (like I, O, U).

 Among ""SHIRT"", ""SPURT"", ""VIRUS"" ... let's see:

 ""SHIRT"": S, H, I, R, T -> common letters: S, T are very common. H, I are also common.
 ""VIRUS"": V is less common.

 So maybe ""SHIRT"" is better because it uses more common letters.

 However, note: the feedback we got for the first word told us that R is present but not in position 2. In ""SHIRT"", R is in position 4. That's a new position we haven't tried. So if R is in position 4 in the secret word, then we will get a '-' again? Actually, wait: if R is not in the correct position we get '-'. But if it is in the correct position, we get '✓'. So by putting R in a new position (say position 4) we are testing if it belongs there.

 Also note: we are trying to get the R's position.

 Therefore, I think ""SHIRT"" is a good word.

 But wait: what if R is actually in position 1? Then ""SHIRT"" would miss that because we put R in position 4. Similarly, we haven't tested position 1,3,5.

 However, we only get one guess and we must include R. We can test R at one new position per guess.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that includes R and also other letters that are common and we haven't tested. But note that we have an eliminated set now: {C, A, N, E}. We must avoid them.

 Given the above, I choose ""SHIRT"". 

 But to be complete, let me consider another word: ""ROBOT""? But O and also R is at position 1? But we haven't tested position 1. And it avoids A, C, N, E? Yes. However, it uses O twice (positions 2 and 4) and then B, T. So the double O reduces the information.

 So ""ROBOT"" tests fewer unique letters.

 Therefore, I think ""SHIRT"" is a solid choice.

 But wait: in ""SHIRT"", the letter I is in position 3. We haven't ruled out I.

 Alternatively, what about ""SHORT""? Avoided letters: S, H, O, R, T. But O is present. However, we haven't ruled out O. But note: the word ""SHORT"" has R at position 3? Actually: S (1), H (2), O (3), R (4) -> wait, no: the positions: 
   - S at 1, H at 2, O at 3, R at 4? Then R is at position 4 again? Actually, if we spell SHORT: S-H-O-R-T so R is at position 4? But then what? Same as SHIRT.

 Alternatively, ""ROOST"" has R at 1 but eliminates itself? Because we must avoid double letters? Actually, double O is allowed, but we may not get as much info. And it has R at 1, which is new.

 However, ""ROOST"" is a word? Yes, meaning of a pigeon perch.

 But again, double O. 

 Given the trade-off, I think ""SHIRT"" is acceptable.

 So I choose: ""SHIRT""

 Therefore, my guess is SHIRT.

 But note: what about ""BRISK""? We don't know B? We haven't eliminated B. And it has R at position 2? But wait: no, B-R-I-S-K: R is at position 2 -> we cannot because R must not be at position 2 (as per previous feedback). But in ""BRISK"", R is in the second position. Therefore, we cannot use that because we know that position 2 is wrong for R.

 So back to ""SHIRT"".

 Final decision: ""SHIRT""

<guess>shirt</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N, E are **not** in the secret word (marked ❌).
- R is in the word but **not in position 2** (marked ➖).

For the next guess:
- Must include **R** (since it exists in the secret word) but avoid placing it in position 2 again.
- Avoid letters C, A, N, E entirely.
- Prioritize new common letters (e.g., S, T, H, I) to gather more information.

Selected **""SHIRT""** because:
- Places R in **position 4** (a new untested position for R).
- Uses S, H, I, T (common, untested consonants).
- Avoids eliminated letters (C, A, N, E) and repeated characters.
- Maximizes coverage of new letters to accelerate deduction.

<guess>shirt</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: shirt -> FEEDBACK: S(x) H(x) I(x) R(✓) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Meaning: 
  - R is in the word but not in position 2 (since it was at position 2 and marked -)
  - C, A, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: shirt -> S(x) H(x) I(x) R(✓) T(x)
Meaning:
  - R is in the word and in the correct position. Since R was in position 4 in ""shirt"", that means the secret word has R at position 4.
  - S, H, I, T are not in the word (all marked x).

Therefore, we know:
  - The secret word has R in position 4.
  - The word does not contain any of: C, A, N, E, S, H, I, T.

Additionally, from the first guess, we know R is present and now we know exactly where (position 4).

We must use only letters that have not been eliminated: all letters except C, A, N, E, S, H, I, T.

What letters are left?
Alphabet minus eliminated: so letters available: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We are missing 5 letters, but we already know the fourth letter is R.

So the secret word pattern: _ _ _ R _

Now, the word must be composed from the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We have not used any letters in positions 1, 2, 3, and 5.

We need to form a valid English word.

Also remember that R is fixed at position 4.

Let's think of common words that fit this pattern.

Possibilities:
- Words ending with R: and the third letter must be one of the available.

Since R is the fourth letter, the word ends with one letter after R? So the last letter is position 5.

Words: 
  - ???R? 

Examples:
 - UMBRELLA: too long, not 5 letters.
 - Focus on 5-letter words.

Common 5-letter words with R at position 4:

Let me recall:
- FLORA? Letters: F,L,O,R,A -> but A is eliminated -> no.
- GROUP? G,R,O,U,P -> R is at position 3? G(1),R(2),O(3),U(4),P(5) -> no, R at 4? That would be letter4: U? Not R.

Position 4 is R. So the word is ...R. meaning the fourth character is R.

Examples:
- WATER: W,A,T,E,R -> R at position 5 -> no, that's fifth.
- TAPER: T,A,P,E,R -> R at 5 -> no.

Words with R as the fourth letter? That means the word ends with R? but wait: positions 1,2,3,R,5.

So the word is of the form: XXXR? where ? is one letter.

Actually, the fifth letter is still free.

So let's think:

- MANOR: M,A,N,O,R -> but A and N are eliminated -> no.
- MAYOR: M,A,Y,O,R -> A eliminated -> no.
- MINOR: M,I,N,O,R -> I and N eliminated -> no.

From available letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

So:
- FLOOR? F,L,O,O,R -> but R is position 5 -> no, positions: F(1), L(2), O(3), O(4) ... so R would be the fifth? Then it doesn't have R at 4.

We need letter 4 to be R.

So:
- Words: ... in position 4 is R, then a fifth letter.

Example: ""BURP"": not 5 letters.

5-letter words: 
- ROBOT -> R,O,B,O,T -> but R at position 1 -> no.
- FROZE? F,R,O,Z,E -> but E and also R is at position 2 -> no.

Perhaps ""MOURN"": M,O,U,R,N -> letters: M(1),O(2),U(3),R(4),N(5). But N is eliminated -> no.

""COURT"": C,O,U,R,T -> C and T eliminated -> no.

""POURS"": P,O,U,R,S -> but S eliminated -> no.

""LOURS"": L,O,U,R,S -> S eliminated -> no.

So let's try to avoid eliminated letters. How about:

""FOLDR"" not a word.

""MOULD? How about ""MOURY""? Not a word.

Another: ""DEARY"" D,E,A,R,Y -> E and A eliminated -> no.

We are constrained by eliminated letters.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Words with pattern ??R? are actually: the R is at the fourth position, so positions 1,2,3 are any consonant or vowel from the allowed set, and position 5 is from the set.

Common words:

- FORUM? F,O,R,U,M -> R at position 3? O is position 2 -> no.

We need R at position 4: so the word structure: [1][2][3]R[5]

For example: 
- ""PURR"" is only 4 letters -> no.

Longer: 
- ""MURKY"" -> M,U,R,K,Y -> R at position 3? M(1),U(2),R(3) -> no.

- ""LURED"" -> L,U,R,E,D -> E eliminated -> no.

- ""BURLY"" -> B,U,R,L,Y -> R at position 3? B(1),U(2),R(3), so wrong.

Alternatively: ""MANOR"" we had, but A and N out.

Wait, we have to have letters in the third position that are available. So what about:

- with O? ""ODOR"" too short.

Another: ""LEVER"" E is out.

Perhaps ""MORPH"" -> M,O,R,P,H? But R at position 3? M(1),O(2),R(3) -> no.

We need R at position 4. So the word should be something like: 

- ""FORTY"": F,O,R,T,Y -> but F(1), O(2), R(3) -> no, R is at 3.

- ""WORRY"": W,O,R,R,Y -> R at 3 and 4, but T and W? W(1),O(2),R(3),R(4),Y(5). So here, R is at 4? Positions: 
   1: W
   2: O
   3: R
   4: R? Then position 4 is the second R? So it would be R at position 3 and 4.

Wait: if the word is ""WORRY"", then:
   Position 1: W
   Position 2: O
   Position 3: R
   Position 4: R
However, we don't have two R positions necessarily.

But in our case, we want the fourth letter to be R? But in WORRY, the third and fourth are R? Then position 4 is R? That's correct? So WORRY has an R at position 4? Actually: 
   W (1), O (2), R (3), R (4), because the double R: the fourth letter is the second R?

Yes: WORRY -> positions: 1:W, 2:O, 3:R, 4:R. So position 4 is R and position 3 is also R.

So WORRY has R at position 4? Yes.

But note: we have R at both positions 3 and 4. But the word has two R's? So that is allowed.

Now check letters: W, O, R, R, Y.

Elimination list: C, A, N, E, S, H, I, T. So W, O, R, Y are all available? Y is available? Yes? Also R we know is present.

However, we used H in shirt and it was eliminated? Is R allowed? Yes, R is in the word and we know it.

But the letter R is already known. So WORRY uses R at position 4 and position 3? That is okay.

But the letters: 
   W: not eliminated? 
   O: not eliminated?
   Y: not eliminated?

So WORRY is a candidate.

But note: position 3 is R, and we can have that? Yes, because we are allowed double letters? In fact, the secret word might have double letters.

Now, but in the feedback for ""shirt"", we got R in position 4 correct. But we don't know if there is another R?

So WORRY: W, O, R, R, Y -> and R is at position 4? Yes.

Another candidate: ""FUROR"": F,U,R,O,R -> positions: F(1), U(2), R(3), O(4), R(5) -> O at position4? Not R.

How about ""RUPEE"": not available because E eliminated.

Another: ""PUKER""? P,U,K,E,R -> E eliminated -> no.

""DOZER"": E -> no.

""ROVER"": R,O,V,E,R -> E -> no.

""GOURD"": G,O,U,R,D -> positions: G(1), O(2), U(3), R(4), D(5). Perfect: position4 is R. And letters are: G,O,U,R,D -> avoid C,A,N,E,S,H,I,T? Yes: G,O,U,D not eliminated.

So ""GOURD"" is a valid word? Yes.

Similarly, ""FOUR"": too short.

Also ""JOURD"" not a word? Probably not.

""WOUND"": W,O,U,N,D -> N eliminated -> no.

So we have:
  - WORRY: W, O, R, R, Y -> common? But double R.
  - GOURD: G, O, U, R, D -> no double letters? Actually single R? GOURD has R at position 4: 
      Position 1: G
      Position 2: O
      Position 3: U
      Position 4: R
      Position 5: D

And G, O, U, R, D: all allowed.

Another: ""BOUND"": B,O,U,N,D -> N eliminated -> no.

""POUND"": P,O,U,N,D -> N eliminated.

""FOUND"": same.

So another possibility: ""COURT"" eliminated.

""MOURN"" eliminated.

""GROUP"" has R at position 2? Not.

But ""PURRE"" not a word.

Another common word: ""FLAIR""? F,L,A,I,R -> A and I eliminated.

Let's think: ""MURKY"" has R at position 3 -> not.

Or ""CURED"": eliminated letters.

So I found GOURD and WORRY.

Also: ""DOUR""... no, only four letters? ""DURRY"" not a word.

""YOUR"" is four.

Another: ""QUERY"": Q,U,E,R,Y -> E eliminated -> no.

""QUORUM"": too long.

""GUARD"": G,U,A,R,D -> A eliminated -> no.

Therefore, two strong candidates: GOURD and WORRY.

But we need to choose one. We don't know if there is a double letter. So let me choose one that tests new letters.

In WORRY: letters W, O, R, R, Y -> so we test W, O, Y and also the double R? But R we know already, and we are testing if position 3 is R? Or if the fifth letter is Y.

In GOURD: G, O, U, R, D -> tests G, O, U, D.

But in the secret word, we have position 4=R fixed, so position 3: either we guess U (for GOURD) or R (for WORRY).

We don't know which.

But note: we have not tried any letter now except R. We are going to test new letters.

Since in WORRY we use R again at position 3, then if the secret word doesn't have R at 3 but we get a minus? Suppose the word is GOURD. Then if we guess WORRY:
  - W: not in GOURD? so x?
  - O: is in GOURD? position 2: O? GOURD: G, O, U, R, D -> O at position 2. In WORRY, O is at position 2? WORRY: W (1), O (2), R (3), R (4), Y (5). So if we guess WORRY and the word is GOURD:
      Position1: W -> x (not in GOURD) 
      Position2: O -> correct? Because GOURD has O at position2? No, GOURD: position2 is O? Then it would be O (✓) but in FEEDBACK? Wait:

Secret word: G O U R D

Guess: W O R R Y

- W: not in the word -> x?
- O: in the word and at position2? Correct -> ✓
- R: in the word? But the secret word has R at position4? The R in guess position3 is R? But secret does not have R at position3 -> but R is in the word, so -
- R: at position4? Correct -> ✓? 
- Y: not in the word? So x.

BUT: the secret word has only one R? But we used two R's: so the feedback might be:

For the first R: in position3 -> since the secret has an R at position4? It's not at 3? So '-'. And the second R (position4) is in the same place? So '✓'.

But we also have the letter O that matches.

But if we guess GOURD and the word is GOURD, then all correct.

But we don't know.

To maximize information, we could choose a word without double letters? So we cover more distinct letters.

Therefore, GOURD might be better because it tests G, O, U, D (new distinct letters) and R.

WORRY repeats R so we get same letter tested again? But we already know R? So testing additional letters may be preferable.

So to cover more letters:  GOURD: tests G, O, U, D.

WORRY: tests W, O, Y and R again (double).

Since O appears in both? We test O? But in WORRY, O is tested? Position2? 

Also, let's see:

We haven't tested G, D, U, W, Y.

But WORRY tests W, O, Y? And GOURD tests G, O, U, D.

We also might consider other words? We can list:

Words matching pattern with available letters:

Letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Pattern: ???R?

Examples (scrabble words?) 

- FORMS: F,O,R,M,S -> but S eliminated -> no.
- GOURD: yes.
- WORRY: yes? But WORRY is valid.
- BOORS: B,O,O,R,S -> S eliminated -> no.
- DOGRO: Not a word.
- FUMED: E eliminated? Only D? F,U,M,E,D -> E -> no.
- GLORY: G,L,O,R,Y -> L and Y available? And L not eliminated? But pattern: we need position4=R? GLORY: G(1),L(2),O(3),R(4),Y(5). Perfect? And letters: G, L, O, Y are available.

GLORY: 
  G: yes
  L: yes
  O: yes
  Y: yes

Is GLORY a word? Yes.

Another: ""GROWY"" not a word.

So we have three candidates:
  - GOURD: G,O,U,R,D
  - WORRY: W,O,R,R,Y
  - GLORY: G,L,O,R,Y

Now, GLORY avoids double letters? Yes.

And we haven't tested L and Y? So GLORY tests G, L, O, R, Y.

But R we already know? So we get information on G, L, O, Y.

Similarly, GOURD tests G,O,U,R,D.

We need to pick one. Which one tests more common letters? 

GLORY uses L and Y? L common, Y less so.

GOURD uses U, D? U vowel? Common? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can also consider ""FJORD"": F,J,O,R,D -> valid? Yes, but J is less common? And F available? Pattern: F(1),J(2),O(3),R(4),D(5). So that works? But J is not common and we might avoid it.

Another word: ""OPTRY""? no.

""ROWDY"": R,O,W,D,Y -> R at position1? Not position4. Skip.

Given the above, I think GLORY is a good candidate? But let's see: we don't know O? We haven't tested O? Yes O is not eliminated.

So why not GLORY? 

But note: in GOURD we have U? Also the position of O? In GLORY O is at position 3? In GOURD O is at position 2? 

We haven't tested O anywhere, so both GLORY and GOURD test O? At different positions.

In GLORY: O is at position3? Then if the secret word has O at position3, we get '-' if not? But we have no information on O.

How about choosing GLORY? Since L is very common, it might yield more information.

But note: we have 6 tries, so we can guess.

Alternatively: we might not need to use all uncommon letters? But GLORY has G which is common? Well, not as much.

Another option: ""MORAY"": M,O,R,A,Y -> A eliminated -> no.

""VOULU"" not a word.

So between GLORY and GOURD? 

How about ""DOUBT""? D,O,U,B,T -> T eliminated -> no. T was eliminated in feedback of ""shirt"".

T is eliminated.

Now, in GOURD: positions: G (new, test pos1), O (new, pos2), U (new, pos3), R (known, pos4), D (new, pos5).

In GLORY: G (new, pos1), L (new, pos2), O (new, pos3), R (known, pos4), Y (new, pos5).

Both are good? 

But we have U available? Also we have not tested U.

I think we can pick GLORY to test L? Or GOURD to test U?

Given that vowels are more constrained? We only have O, U, Y? So testing a vowel could be useful? U is a vowel.

But Y in GLORY? Both vowels.

But GLORY tests L? Which is a common consonant.

However, I recall that we eliminated A, E, I? The vowels we have left are O, U, Y.

Therefore, maybe words with O or U are worth testing? 

But GOURD has both O and U? GLORY has O and Y? 

Since U is more common than Y? Perhaps GOURD is better.

But GLORY uses Y? Which may appear in few words? So testing U might be better? 

However, note: the secret word must have 5 letters and we have R at position4.

We can look for additional words? 

Another word: ""PODGY"" not a word.

""AURUM"" not available.

""FURRY"": F,U,R,R,Y -> R at positions 3 and 4? Pattern: F(1),U(2),R(3),R(4),Y(5). And R is known? So letters F,U,Y? The R repetition.

But F,U,Y available. Pattern: same as WORRY? 

Here: ... but WORRY we considered.

Given that, I think GOURD is a solid choice? Because it tests O at position2 and U at position3? And G and D? Also, we know O is in the word then? Not necessarily? We don't know if O is in the word.

But by guessing O in GOURD, we can see if O is present? 

Similarly, in GLORY we test O? 

But GLORY tests L? which might not be in many words? Wait no, L is common.

Given the dictionary, GUORD  and GLORY are both reasonable.

But let me choose one: GOURD? Because U has not been tried and might be common? 

But I think it is fine.

So I choose GOURD.

But wait: are we allowed GOURD? Yes.

Alternatively, ""FOCUS"" not matching pattern? 

Or ""JUMPS"" S eliminated.

So GOURD: guess.

Final decision: GOURD

Let me write: <guess>gourd</guess>

But note: we know position4=R and only 6 tries? This could be the actual word? Or not.

So we'll see.

<guess>gourd</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- From **crane**: R is in the secret word but NOT in position 2, and C, A, N, E are NOT in the word.
- From **shirt**: R is in position 4 (correctly placed), and S, H, I, T are NOT in the word.

Thus, the secret word:
- Must have R in position 4 (pattern: `_ _ _ R _`).
- Cannot contain C, A, N, E, S, H, I, T (eliminated letters).
- Must use remaining letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

After evaluating possible words that fit the pattern and avoid eliminated letters (e.g., GOURD positions G(1), O(2), U(3), R(4), D(5)), ""GOURD"" was selected because:
- It tests new common letters (O, U) and consonants (G, D).
- Positions O(2) and U(3) provide critical information on placement of vowels/known absent letters.
- Avoids eliminated letters and maximizes coverage of untested characters (O is a high-frequency vowel).

We can put R in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\n We also want to cover as many new letters as possible.\n\n Let me consider words that start with R? But note: if we put R in position 1, then we can check if R is at the beginning. However, we don\'t have much information so maybe a word with R in the middle or end is fine.\n\n A common word that comes to mind: ""ROAST"" has R (first letter) and O, A, S, T. But A was already eliminated (because in the first guess, A was marked \'x\'). So we cannot use A.\n\n Let me avoid A because it\'s eliminated.\n\n Possibilities: ""TRYST"", but that has T and Y. Also, we haven\'t eliminated T. But note: the word must be 5 letters and valid.\n\n Alternatively: ""DRYLY"" - but that repeats Y and isn\'t very informative.\n\n Another idea: ""POURS"" has P, O, U, R, S. But we don\'t know about O, U, S. Also, R is in the fourth position (if spelled P-O-U-R-S). So R is at position 4.\n\n However, note: we must not use eliminated letters: C, A, N, E. So ""POURS"" avoids these.\n\n Another common word: ""TRIES"" but E is eliminated so no.\n\n Similarly: ""GROSS"" - G, R, O, S, S. R is at position 2? But we already tried R at position 2 and it was wrong. So we cannot put R at position 2 again. So ""GROSS"" has R at position 2 -> not allowed because we know R is not in position 2.\n\n We need to pick a word where R is not in position 2.\n\n Let me look for a word that has R in a different position:\n\n Possibilities:\n  - Position 1: R (then we get to check if it\'s at the start). Words: ROOMY? But O is not eliminated. However, ROOMY has double O and also Y. But also: note that ROOMY uses O twice and we don\'t know about O.\n\n  Another word: ""ROWDY"" - R, O, W, D, Y. But again, O and we have to see.\n\n  Position 3: Let\'s say ""TARES"" but A is eliminated -> no.\n\n  Position 4: ""STARL"" not a word? ""STARE"" but E and A are out -> no.\n\n  Position 5: ""LATER"" has A and E -> no.\n\n So let\'s try to avoid eliminated letters and put R in a new position.\n\n Here\'s an idea: ""POINT"" doesn\'t have R -> we must include R because we know it\'s in the word.\n\n Another: ""MORPH"" - M, O, R, P, H. R at position 3. And it doesn\'t use A, C, N, E. This seems okay.\n\n But wait, we don\'t know anything about O, but that\'s fine.\n\n Another candidate: ""SPRIG"" - S, P, R, I, G. R is at position 3? Actually, positions: S (1), P (2), R (3), I (4), G (5). So R is at position 3. This avoids the eliminated letters.\n\n Another: ""QUIRK"" - Q, U, I, R, K. R at position 4.\n\n However, we don\'t know about Q, U, I, K and so on.\n\n Considering commonality, words with more vowels might be better? But we know the word doesn\'t have A, E? Only vowels left are I, O, U, and sometimes Y.\n\n Let me list words: \n   - ""WORLD"" has W, O, R, L, D -> R at position 3. This word: W is common? Not as much as others. Also, O and L are common.\n\n   - ""DOUBT"" doesn\'t have R -> skip.\n\n   - ""BUILT"" doesn\'t have R -> skip.\n\n   - ""PRISM"" - P, R, I, S, M -> R at the second position. But wait: P (1), R (2). But we had R at position 2 in ""crane"" and it was wrong, so we cannot put R in position 2.\n\n   ""PRISM"" is invalid because R must not be at position 2.\n\n How about ""VIRUS""? V, I, R, U, S -> R at position 3? Actually: positions: V (1), I (2), R (3), U (4), S (5). So R at position 3. This avoids A, C, E, N and doesn\'t include repeated letters.\n\n This seems good.\n\n Another candidate: ""FRISK"" -> F, R, I, S, K. But R is at position 2? So R is at the second position -> not allowed.\n\n We must avoid position 2 for R.\n\n So ""VIRUS"" seems okay.\n\n Another word: ""TRULY"" -> T, R, U, L, Y -> R at position 2? No: T(1), R(2) -> again second position -> skip.\n\n What about ""SHIRT"" -> S, H, I, R, T -> R at position 4. And avoided eliminated letters? Yes: no A, C, E, N.\n\n So ""SHIRT"" is another candidate.\n\n We can also consider ""SPURT"" -> S, P, U, R, T -> R at position 4.\n\n But note: we want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\n Since we have a limited number of guesses, we should prioritize words that include common consonants (like S, T, L, M, D, etc.) and vowels (like I, O, U).\n\n Among ""SHIRT"", ""SPURT"", ""VIRUS"" ... let\'s see:\n\n ""SHIRT"": S, H, I, R, T -> common letters: S, T are very common. H, I are also common.\n ""VIRUS"": V is less common.\n\n So maybe ""SHIRT"" is better because it uses more common letters.\n\n However, note: the feedback we got for the first word told us that R is present but not in position 2. In ""SHIRT"", R is in position 4. That\'s a new position we haven\'t tried. So if R is in position 4 in the secret word, then we will get a \'-\' again? Actually, wait: if R is not in the correct position we get \'-\'. But if it is in the correct position, we get \'✓\'. So by putting R in a new position (say position 4) we are testing if it belongs there.\n\n Also note: we are trying to get the R\'s position.\n\n Therefore, I think ""SHIRT"" is a good word.\n\n But wait: what if R is actually in position 1? Then ""SHIRT"" would miss that because we put R in position 4. Similarly, we haven\'t tested position 1,3,5.\n\n However, we only get one guess and we must include R. We can test R at one new position per guess.\n\n Alternatively, we could try a word that includes R and also other letters that are common and we haven\'t tested. But note that we have an eliminated set now: {C, A, N, E}. We must avoid them.\n\n Given the above, I choose ""SHIRT"". \n\n But to be complete, let me consider another word: ""ROBOT""? But O and also R is at position 1? But we haven\'t tested position 1. And it avoids A, C, N, E? Yes. However, it uses O twice (positions 2 and 4) and then B, T. So the double O reduces the information.\n\n So ""ROBOT"" tests fewer unique letters.\n\n Therefore, I think ""SHIRT"" is a solid choice.\n\n But wait: in ""SHIRT"", the letter I is in position 3. We haven\'t ruled out I.\n\n Alternatively, what about ""SHORT""? Avoided letters: S, H, O, R, T. But O is present. However, we haven\'t ruled out O. But note: the word ""SHORT"" has R at position 3? Actually: S (1), H (2), O (3), R (4) -> wait, no: the positions: \n   - S at 1, H at 2, O at 3, R at 4? Then R is at position 4 again? Actually, if we spell SHORT: S-H-O-R-T so R is at position 4? But then what? Same as SHIRT.\n\n Alternatively, ""ROOST"" has R at 1 but eliminates itself? Because we must avoid double letters? Actually, double O is allowed, but we may not get as much info. And it has R at 1, which is new.\n\n However, ""ROOST"" is a word? Yes, meaning of a pigeon perch.\n\n But again, double O. \n\n Given the trade-off, I think ""SHIRT"" is acceptable.\n\n So I choose: ""SHIRT""\n\n Therefore, my guess is SHIRT.\n\n But note: what about ""BRISK""? We don\'t know B? We haven\'t eliminated B. And it has R at position 2? But wait: no, B-R-I-S-K: R is at position 2 -> we cannot because R must not be at position 2 (as per previous feedback). But in ""BRISK"", R is in the second position. Therefore, we cannot use that because we know that position 2 is wrong for R.\n\n So back to ""SHIRT"".\n\n Final decision: ""SHIRT""\n\n<guess>shirt</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, A, N, E are **not** in the secret word (marked ❌).\n- R is in the word but **not in position 2** (marked ➖).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **R** (since it exists in the secret word) but avoid placing it in position 2 again.\n- Avoid letters C, A, N, E entirely.\n- Prioritize new common letters (e.g., S, T, H, I) to gather more information.\n\nSelected **""SHIRT""** because:\n- Places R in **position 4** (a new untested position for R).\n- Uses S, H, I, T (common, untested consonants).\n- Avoids eliminated letters (C, A, N, E) and repeated characters.\n- Maximizes coverage of new letters to accelerate deduction.\n\n<guess>shirt</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: shirt -> FEEDBACK: S(x) H(x) I(x) R(✓) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nMeaning: \n  - R is in the word but not in position 2 (since it was at position 2 and marked -)\n  - C, A, N, E are not in the word.\n\nGuess 2: shirt -> S(x) H(x) I(x) R(✓) T(x)\nMeaning:\n  - R is in the word and in the correct position.

That means the word ends with R? but wait: positions 1,2,3,R,5.\n\nSo the word is of the form: XXXR? where ? is one letter.\n\nActually, the fifth letter is still free.\n\nSo let\'s think:\n\n- MANOR: M,A,N,O,R -> but A and N are eliminated -> no.\n- MAYOR: M,A,Y,O,R -> A eliminated -> no.\n- MINOR: M,I,N,O,R -> I and N eliminated -> no.\n\nFrom available letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nSo:\n- FLOOR? F,L,O,O,R -> but R is position 5 -> no, positions: F(1), L(2), O(3), O(4) ... so R would be the fifth? Then it doesn\'t have R at 4.\n\nWe need letter 4 to be R.\n\nSo:\n- Words: ... in position 4 is R, then a fifth letter.\n\nExample: ""BURP"": not 5 letters.\n\n5-letter words: \n- ROBOT -> R,O,B,O,T -> but R at position 1 -> no.\n- FROZE? F,R,O,Z,E -> but E and also R is at position 2 -> no.\n\nPerhaps ""MOURN"": M,O,U,R,N -> letters: M(1),O(2),U(3),R(4),N(5). But N is eliminated -> no.\n\n""COURT"": C,O,U,R,T -> C and T eliminated -> no.\n\n""POURS"": P,O,U,R,S -> but S eliminated -> no.\n\n""LOURS"": L,O,U,R,S -> S eliminated -> no.\n\nSo let\'s try to avoid eliminated letters. How about:\n\n""FOLDR"" not a word.\n\n""MOULD? How about ""MOURY""? Not a word.\n\nAnother: ""DEARY"" D,E,A,R,Y -> E and A eliminated -> no.\n\nWe are constrained by eliminated letters.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWords with pattern ??R? are actually: the R is at the fourth position, so positions 1,2,3 are any consonant or vowel from the allowed set, and position 5 is from the set.\n\nCommon words:\n\n- FORUM? F,O,R,U,M -> R at position 3? O is position 2 -> no.\n\nWe need R at position 4: so the word structure: [1][2][3]R[5]\n\nFor example: \n- ""PURR"" is only 4 letters -> no.\n\nLonger: \n- ""MURKY"" -> M,U,R,K,Y -> R at position 3? M(1),U(2),R(3) -> no.\n\n- ""LURED"" -> L,U,R,E,D -> E eliminated -> no.\n\n- ""BURLY"" -> B,U,R,L,Y -> R at position 3? B(1),U(2),R(3), so wrong.\n\nAlternatively: ""MANOR"" we had, but A and N out.\n\nWait, we have to have letters in the third position that are available. So what about:\n\n- with O? ""ODOR"" too short.\n\nAnother: ""LEVER"" E is out.\n\nPerhaps ""MORPH"" -> M,O,R,P,H? But R at position 3? M(1),O(2),R(3) -> no.\n\nWe need R at position 4. So the word should be something like: \n\n- ""FORTY"": F,O,R,T,Y -> but F(1), O(2), R(3) -> no, R is at 3.\n\n- ""WORRY"": W,O,R,R,Y -> R at 3 and 4, but T and W? W(1),O(2),R(3),R(4),Y(5). So here, R is at 4? Positions: \n   1: W\n   2: O\n   3: R\n   4: R? Then position 4 is the second R? So it would be R at position 3 and 4.\n\nWait: if the word is ""WORRY"", then:\n   Position 1: W\n   Position 2: O\n   Position 3: R\n   Position 4: R\nHowever, we don\'t have two R positions necessarily.\n\nBut in our case, we want the fourth letter to be R? But in WORRY, the third and fourth are R? Then position 4 is R? That\'s correct? So WORRY has an R at position 4? Actually: \n   W (1), O (2), R (3), R (4), because the double R: the fourth letter is the second R?\n\nYes: WORRY -> positions: 1:W, 2:O, 3:R, 4:R. So position 4 is R and position 3 is also R.\n\nSo WORRY has R at position 4? Yes.\n\nBut note: we have R at both positions 3 and 4. But the word has two R\'s? So that is allowed.\n\nNow check letters: W, O, R, R, Y.\n\nElimination list: C, A, N, E, S, H, I, T. So W, O, R, Y are all available? Y is available? Yes? Also R we know is present.\n\nHowever, we used H in shirt and it was eliminated? Is R allowed? Yes, R is in the word and we know it.\n\nBut the letter R is already known. So WORRY uses R at position 4 and position 3? That is okay.\n\nBut the letters: \n   W: not eliminated? \n   O: not eliminated?\n   Y: not eliminated?\n\nSo WORRY is a candidate.\n\nBut note: position 3 is R, and we can have that? Yes, because we are allowed double letters? In fact, the secret word might have double letters.\n\nNow, but in the feedback for ""shirt"", we got R in position 4 correct. But we don\'t know if there is another R?\n\nSo WORRY: W, O, R, R, Y -> and R is at position 4? Yes.\n\nAnother candidate: ""FUROR"": F,U,R,O,R -> positions: F(1), U(2), R(3), O(4), R(5) -> O at position4? Not R.\n\nHow about ""RUPEE"": not available because E eliminated.\n\nAnother: ""PUKER""? P,U,K,E,R -> E eliminated -> no.\n\n""DOZER"": E -> no.\n\n""ROVER"": R,O,V,E,R -> E -> no.\n\n""GOURD"": G,O,U,R,D -> positions: G(1), O(2), U(3), R(4), D(5). Perfect: position4 is R. And letters are: G,O,U,R,D -> avoid C,A,N,E,S,H,I,T? Yes: G,O,U,D not eliminated.\n\nSo ""GOURD"" is a valid word? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, ""FOUR"": too short.\n\nAlso ""JOURD"" not a word? Probably not.\n\n""WOUND"": W,O,U,N,D -> N eliminated -> no.\n\nSo we have:\n  - WORRY: W, O, R, R, Y -> common? But double R.\n  - GOURD: G, O, U, R, D -> no double letters? Actually single R? GOURD has R at position 4: \n      Position 1: G\n      Position 2: O\n      Position 3: U\n      Position 4: R\n      Position 5: D\n\nAnd G, O, U, R, D: all allowed.\n\nAnother: ""BOUND"": B,O,U,N,D -> N eliminated -> no.\n\n""POUND"": P,O,U,N,D -> N eliminated.\n\n""FOUND"": same.\n\nSo another possibility: ""COURT"" eliminated.\n\n""MOURN"" eliminated.\n\n""GROUP"" has R at position 2? Not.\n\nBut ""PURRE"" not a word.\n\nAnother common word: ""FLAIR""? F,L,A,I,R -> A and I eliminated.\n\nLet\'s think: ""MURKY"" has R at position 3 -> not.\n\nOr ""CURED"": eliminated letters.\n\nSo I found GOURD and WORRY.\n\nAlso: ""DOUR""... no, only four letters? ""DURRY"" not a word.\n\n""YOUR"" is four.\n\nAnother: ""QUERY"": Q,U,E,R,Y -> E eliminated -> no.\n\n""QUORUM"": too long.\n\n""GUARD"": G,U,A,R,D -> A eliminated -> no.\n\nTherefore, two strong candidates: GOURD and WORRY.\n\nBut we need to choose one. We don\'t know if there is a double letter. So let me choose one that tests new letters.\n\nIn WORRY: letters W, O, R, R, Y -> so we test W, O, Y and also the double R? But R we know already, and we are testing if position 3 is R? Or if the fifth letter is Y.\n\nIn GOURD: G, O, U, R, D -> tests G, O, U, D.\n\nBut in the secret word, we have position 4=R fixed, so position 3: either we guess U (for GOURD) or R (for WORRY).\n\nWe don\'t know which.\n\nBut note: we have not tried any letter now except R. We are going to test new letters.\n\nSince in WORRY we use R again at position 3, then if the secret word doesn\'t have R at 3 but we get a minus? Suppose the word is GOURD. Then if we guess WORRY:\n  - W: not in GOURD? so x?\n  - O: is in GOURD? position 2: O? GOURD: G, O, U, R, D -> O at position 2. In WORRY, O is at position 2? WORRY: W (1), O (2), R (3), R (4), Y (5). So if we guess WORRY and the word is GOURD:\n      Position1: W -> x (not in GOURD) \n      Position2: O -> correct? Because GOURD has O at position2? No, GOURD: position2 is O? Then it would be O (✓) but in FEEDBACK? Wait:\n\nSecret word: G O U R D\n\nGuess: W O R R Y\n\n- W: not in the word -> x?\n- O: in the word and at position2? Correct -> ✓\n- R: in the word? But the secret word has R at position4? The R in guess position3 is R? But secret does not have R at position3 -> but R is in the word, so -\n- R: at position4? Correct -> ✓? \n- Y: not in the word? So x.\n\nBUT: the secret word has only one R? But we used two R\'s: so the feedback might be:\n\nFor the first R: in position3 -> since the secret has an R at position4? It\'s not at 3? So \'-\'. And the second R (position4) is in the same place? So \'✓\'.\n\nBut we also have the letter O that matches.\n\nBut if we guess GOURD and the word is GOURD, then all correct.\n\nBut we don\'t know.\n\nTo maximize information, we could choose a word without double letters? So we cover more distinct letters.\n\nTherefore, GOURD might be better because it tests G, O, U, D (new distinct letters) and R.\n\nWORRY repeats R so we get same letter tested again? But we already know R? So testing additional letters may be preferable.\n\nSo to cover more letters:  GOURD: tests G, O, U, D.\n\nWORRY: tests W, O, Y and R again (double).\n\nSince O appears in both? We test O? But in WORRY, O is tested? Position2? \n\nAlso, let\'s see:\n\nWe haven\'t tested G, D, U, W, Y.\n\nBut WORRY tests W, O, Y? And GOURD tests G, O, U, D.\n\nWe also might consider other words? We can list:\n\nWords matching pattern with available letters:\n\nLetters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nPattern: ???R?\n\nExamples (scrabble words?) \n\n- FORMS: F,O,R,M,S -> but S eliminated -> no.\n- GOURD: yes.\n- WORRY: yes? But WORRY is valid.\n- BOORS: B,O,O,R,S -> S eliminated -> no.\n- DOGRO: Not a word.\n- FUMED: E eliminated? Only D? F,U,M,E,D -> E -> no.\n- GLORY: G,L,O,R,Y -> L and Y available? And L not eliminated? But pattern: we need position4=R? GLORY: G(1),L(2),O(3),R(4),Y(5). Perfect? And letters: G, L, O, Y are available.\n\nGLORY: \n  G: yes\n  L: yes\n  O: yes\n  Y: yes\n\nIs GLORY a word? Yes.\n\nAnother: ""GROWY"" not a word.\n\nSo we have three candidates:\n  - GOURD: G,O,U,R,D\n  - WORRY: W,O,R,R,Y\n  - GLORY: G,L,O,R,Y\n\nNow, GLORY avoids double letters? Yes.\n\nAnd we haven\'t tested L and Y? So GLORY tests G, L, O, R, Y.\n\nBut R we already know? So we get information on G, L, O, Y.\n\nSimilarly, GOURD tests G,O,U,R,D.\n\nWe need to pick one. Which one tests more common letters? \n\nGLORY uses L and Y? L common, Y less so.\n\nGOURD uses U, D? U vowel? Common? But we don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, we can also consider ""FJORD"": F,J,O,R,D -> valid? Yes, but J is less common? And F available? Pattern: F(1),J(2),O(3),R(4),D(5). So that works? But J is not common and we might avoid it.\n\nAnother word: ""OPTRY""? no.\n\n""ROWDY"": R,O,W,D,Y -> R at position1? Not position4. Skip.\n\nGiven the above, I think GLORY is a good candidate? But let\'s see: we don\'t know O? We haven\'t tested O? Yes O is not eliminated.\n\nSo why not GLORY? \n\nBut note: in GOURD we have U? Also the position of O? In GLORY O is at position 3? In GOURD O is at position 2? \n\nWe haven\'t tested O anywhere, so both GLORY and GOURD test O? At different positions.\n\nIn GLORY: O is at position3? Then if the secret word has O at position3, we get \'-\' if not? But we have no information on O.\n\nHow about choosing GLORY? Since L is very common, it might yield more information.\n\nBut note: we have 6 tries, so we can guess.\n\nAlternatively: we might not need to use all uncommon letters? But GLORY has G which is common? Well, not as much.\n\nAnother option: ""MORAY"": M,O,R,A,Y -> A eliminated -> no.\n\n""VOULU"" not a word.\n\nSo between GLORY and GOURD? \n\nHow about ""DOUBT""? D,O,U,B,T -> T eliminated -> no. T was eliminated in feedback of ""shirt"".\n\nT is eliminated.\n\nNow, in GOURD: positions: G (new, test pos1), O (new, pos2), U (new, pos3), R (known, pos4), D (new, pos5).\n\nIn GLORY: G (new, pos1), L (new, pos2), O (new, pos3), R (known, pos4), Y (new, pos5).\n\nBoth are good? \n\nBut we have U available? Also we have not tested U.\n\nI think we can pick GLORY to test L? Or GOURD to test U?\n\nGiven that vowels are more constrained? We only have O, U, Y? So testing a vowel could be useful? U is a vowel.\n\nBut Y in GLORY? Both vowels.\n\nBut GLORY tests L? Which is a common consonant.\n\nHowever, I recall that we eliminated A, E, I? The vowels we have left are O, U, Y.\n\nTherefore, maybe words with O or U are worth testing? \n\nBut GOURD has both O and U? GLORY has O and Y? \n\nSince U is more common than Y? Perhaps GOURD is better.\n\nBut GLORY uses Y? Which may appear in few words? So testing U might be better? \n\nHowever, note: the secret word must have 5 letters and we have R at position4.\n\nWe can look for additional words? \n\nAnother word: ""PODGY"" not a word.\n\n""AURUM"" not available.\n\n""FURRY"": F,U,R,R,Y -> R at positions 3 and 4? Pattern: F(1),U(2),R(3),R(4),Y(5). And R is known? So letters F,U,Y? The R repetition.\n\nBut F,U,Y available. Pattern: same as WORRY? \n\nHere: ... but WORRY we considered.\n\nGiven that, I think GOURD is a solid choice? Because it tests O at position2 and U at position3? And G and D? Also, we know O is in the word then? Not necessarily? We don\'t know if O is in the word.\n\nBut by guessing O in GOURD, we can see if O is present? \n\nSimilarly, in GLORY we test O? \n\nBut GLORY tests L? which might not be in many words? Wait no, L is common.\n\nGiven the dictionary, GUORD  and GLORY are both reasonable.\n\nBut let me choose one: GOURD? Because U has not been tried and might be common? \n\nBut I think it is fine.\n\nSo I choose GOURD.\n\nBut wait: are we allowed GOURD? Yes.\n\nAlternatively, ""FOCUS"" not matching pattern? \n\nOr ""JUMPS"" S eliminated.\n\nSo GOURD: guess.\n\nFinal decision: GOURD\n\nLet me write: <guess>gourd</guess>\n\nBut note: we know position4=R and only 6 tries? This could be the actual word? Or not.\n\nSo we\'ll see.\n\n<guess>gourd</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- From **crane**: R is in the secret word but NOT in position 2, and C, A, N, E are NOT in the word.\n- From **shirt**: R is in position 4 (correctly placed), and S, H, I, T are NOT in the word.\n\nThus, the secret word:\n- Must have R in position 4 (pattern: `_ _ _ R _`).\n- Cannot contain C, A, N, E, S, H, I, T (eliminated letters).\n- Must use remaining letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nAfter evaluating possible words that fit the pattern and avoid eliminated letters (e.g., GOURD positions G(1), O(2), U(3), R(4), D(5)), ""GOURD"" was selected because:\n- It tests new common letters (O, U) and consonants (G, D).\n- Positions O(2) and U(3) provide critical information on placement of vowels/known absent letters.\n- Avoids eliminated letters and maximizes coverage of untested characters (O is a high-frequency vowel).\n\n<guess>gourd</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: shirt -> FEEDBACK: S(x) H(x) I(x) R(✓) T(x)\nGuess 3: gourd -> FEEDBACK: G(x) O(✓) U(x) R(✓) D(-)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback from the third guess: ""gourd"" -> G(x) O(✓) U(x) R(✓) D(-)

Interpretation:
- G(x): G is not in the word.
- O(✓): O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- U(x): U is not in the word.
- R(✓): R is in the word and in the correct position (position 4). We already knew R was at position 4, so this confirms.
- D(-): D is in the word but not in the correct position (since it's at position 5 in the guess, but the secret word has D somewhere else).

So, what we know now:
- The secret word has O in position 2 and R in position 4. So the pattern is: _ O _ R _
- The word contains D, but not in position 5 (because in ""gourd"", D was at position 5 and got '-', meaning it's present but misplaced).
- The word does not contain: C, A, N, E, S, H, I, T, G, U (all marked x in previous feedbacks).

Additionally, from the D(-) we know D is in the word but not at position 5.

Eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, S, H, I, T, G, U.

Available letters: B, D, F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: D is in the word, so we must use D. But D cannot be at position 5.

The pattern: position 1: ?, position 2: O, position 3: ?, position 4: R, position 5: ?

We know D is in the word, but not at position 5. So D must be in position 1 or 3? Because positions 2 and 4 are fixed as O and R.

So D can be at position 1 or 3.

Now, the word must be composed of the available letters, and we know D is one of them.

We also have to fill position 1, 3, and 5 with letters from the available set, but note that D is already used? Actually, we don't know if there are duplicate letters? But we haven't seen any duplicates so far? But we can't rule it out.

However, we know D is present, so at least one D.

Now, the available letters for positions 1, 3, 5: 
  - Position 1: can be any available letter except O and R? But O and R are fixed at 2 and 4. So position 1: B, D, F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and D is allowed here? but note D might be at position 1 or 3).
  - Position 3: similarly, available letters: B, D, F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and D can be here? but if D is at position 3, then we have to avoid using D again at position 5? unless duplicate? but we don't know).
  - Position 5: must be from the available letters, but D cannot be here (because of the feedback: D(-) and it was at position 5). So position 5: B, F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (no D).

But note: D is in the word, so it must appear at either position 1 or 3.

Now, we need to form a valid English word.

Let's list possible words:

Pattern: [1] O [3] R [5]

With [1] and [3] being from the available letters (and one of them must be D? because D is in the word) and [5] from available without D.

But note: D must be in the word, so either [1] is D or [3] is D.

Case 1: D at position 1 -> then word: D O [3] R [5]
  - [3] must be from available letters except D? because if D is at 1, then [3] can be any available except D? unless duplicate? but we don't know if duplicate is allowed? So we can have duplicate? But we haven't seen any feedback with duplicate? So we can't rule out? But to be safe, we can consider both.

But let's first assume no duplicate? Then if D is at 1, then [3] cannot be D? and [5] cannot be D? So [3] and [5] from: B, F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Similarly, if D is at position 3, then word: [1] O D R [5] -> [1] from available without D? and [5] without D.

But we must consider that D might be duplicated? But let's first try without.

Now, what words fit?

First, if D at position 1: D O ? R ?

Examples:
- DOGMA? But G and A eliminated -> no.
- DOWRY? D,O,W,R,Y -> but W and Y available? And R is at 4? D(1),O(2),W(3),R(4),Y(5). So this fits? But we have to check eliminated letters: D, O, W, R, Y -> D is at 1? But we have D at 1? Then W at 3? Y at 5? And eliminated letters: none of these are eliminated? 
  - D: is in the word? We know D is in the word? But in this case, D is at position 1? Then the feedback for ""gourd"" had D at position 5? But in the secret word, D is at position 1? So in ""gourd"", we had D at position 5? and the secret word has D at position 1? Then the feedback for D would be '-' meaning present but wrong position? Which matches.

So DOWRY is a candidate? But wait: in DOWRY, we have O at 2? R at 4? and D at 1? W at 3? Y at 5? 

But we have to check if W and Y are available? Yes, they are not eliminated.

But note: in the feedback for ""gourd"", we had D(-) meaning D is present but not at position 5? So if the word is DOWRY, then D is at 1? So that matches.

But is DOWRY a valid word? Yes.

Second case: D at position 3: then word: ? O D R ?

So [1] O D R [5]

[1] from available without D: B, F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
[5] from available without D: same.

Examples:
- BODER? Not a word.
- FODER? No.
- MODER? Not common? 
- PODEX? Not a word.
- RODEO? But R at position1? But we have R at position4? And O at2? D at3? Then E and O? But E eliminated? And also O at the end? But pattern: R(1),O(2),D(3),E(4),O(5) -> but we need R at4? Not at1? So no.
- How about ""JODEL""? J,O,D,E,L -> E eliminated -> no.
- ""VODKA"": V,O,D,K,A -> A eliminated -> no.
- ""WODGE"": W,O,D,G,E -> G and E eliminated -> no.
- ""YODEL"": Y,O,D,E,L -> E eliminated -> no.

So it seems hard to find a word with D at position 3? 

Another: ""BODLE""? Not a word.

""MODEL"": M,O,D,E,L -> E eliminated.

Therefore, the only candidate we have so far is DOWRY? But wait, are there others?

What about if D is at position 1? Other words:

- DOVER? D,O,V,E,R -> E eliminated -> no.
- DOZER? E -> no.
- DOPER? D,O,P,E,R -> E -> no.
- DOWLE? Not a word? 
- DOWLY? D,O,W,L,Y -> pattern: D(1),O(2),W(3),L(4),Y(5) -> but we need R at position4? Here position4 is L? So no.

But DOWRY has R at position4? So that's the only one we found? 

But what about DOWRY? We have DOWRY: D, O, W, R, Y -> positions: 1:D, 2:O, 3:W, 4:R, 5:Y.

But we have to check if W and Y are available? Yes.

But note: we have not tested W and Y? So we can guess DOWRY? But we have 6 tries? We can guess it? But we are at guess 4? So we can.

But we might want to get more information? Because if we are wrong, we have two more guesses? But we have a candidate? So we can guess it.

But let me see if there are other candidates? 

What about if D is at position 1? And we have other letters? 

For example: DOLLY? D,O,L,L,Y -> but position4 must be R? So we have L at position4? Not R? So no.

DOXIE? D,O,X,I,E -> I and E eliminated.

So DOWRY seems the only candidate? 

But wait: what about D at position 3? We didn't find any? 

Another possibility: ""MORDA""? M,O,R,D,A -> A eliminated -> no.

""FORDS"": F,O,R,D,S -> S eliminated -> no.

""YORDS""? Not a word.

""WORDY"": W,O,R,D,Y -> pattern: W(1),O(2),R(3),D(4),Y(5) -> but we need R at position4? Here R is at position3? So no.

""ROWDY"": R,O,W,D,Y -> R at position1? Not.

So the only candidate we have is DOWRY? 

But wait: what about ""DORMY""? D,O,R,M,Y -> pattern: D(1),O(2),R(3),M(4),Y(5) -> but we need R at position4? Here R is at position3? So no.

Therefore, DOWRY is the only candidate? 

But we have to consider that D might be duplicated? For example, if the word is ""DODGY""? But G eliminated -> no.

Or ""DUDED""? U and E eliminated -> no.

So I think DOWRY is the only candidate? 

But let me double-check: 

Pattern: _ O _ R _

With D in the word (not at position5) and not in the eliminated set.

Available letters: B, D, F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to fill position1,3,5.

Position1: can be D? Then position3: cannot be D? (if no duplicate) -> then W? and position5: Y? -> DOWRY.

If position1 is not D, then position3 must be D? Then position1: one of the available? and position5: one of the available? But we couldn't find any word? 

What about ""BODRY""? Not a word.

""FODRY""? No.

""JOWAR""? J,O,W,A,R -> A eliminated -> no.

""LORDY""? L,O,R,D,Y -> but R at position3? L(1),O(2),R(3),D(4),Y(5) -> but we need R at position4? So no.

""WORDY"": same issue.

So I think DOWRY is the only candidate? 

Therefore, we should guess DOWRY.

But note: we have to make sure that DOWRY is a valid word? Yes, it is (a dowry is a type of payment).

So let's guess DOWRY.

But we are at guess 4? We can guess it? 

Alternatively, we could try to get more information? But we have only one candidate? So we can guess it.

But what if the word is not DOWRY? Then we have two more guesses? But we don't have other candidates? So we must guess DOWRY.

So <guess>dowry</guess>

But let me see: the feedback for ""gourd"" had D(-) meaning D is present but not at position5? In DOWRY, D is at position1? So that matches.

Also, O and R are correct? So in DOWRY, O at2 and R at4? So they should be correct? 

Therefore, we are confident.

So the guess is DOWRY.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: R is in the word but not in position 2; C, A, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (shirt)**: R is in position 4 (correct); S, H, I, T are absent.
- **Guess 3 (gourd)**: O is in position 2 (correct), R is in position 4 (confirmed), D is present but not in position 5; G and U are absent.

### Key Insights:
- **Secret word pattern**: `_ O _ R _` (positions 2 and 4 are fixed as O and R).
- **D is in the word** but not in position 5 (must be in position 1 or 3).
- **Eliminated letters**: C, A, N, E, S, H, I, T, G, U (cannot appear).
- **Available letters**: B, D, F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- **Constraints**: D must appear in position 1 or 3 (since it cannot be in position 5 and positions 2/4 are fixed). Position 5 cannot be D.

### Analysis:
- After evaluating possible words fitting the pattern `_ O _ R _` with D in position 1 or 3 and using only available letters, **DOWRY** (D at position 1, O at 2, W at 3, R at 4, Y at 5) is the only valid English word that matches:
  - D is present and correctly placed at position 1 (satisfies D not in position 5).
  - O and R are confirmed in positions 2 and 4.
  - W and Y are untested available letters.
- No other valid words fit the pattern (e.g., attempts like ""BODRY"" or ""JODEL"" are invalid or use eliminated letters).

### Conclusion:
Given the constraints and limited options, **DOWRY** is the strongest candidate. If correct, it solves the puzzle; if not, the feedback will confirm D's position (if misplaced) or reveal new letters.

<guess>dowry</guess>",dowry,"We are given feedback from the third guess: ""gourd"" -> G(x) O(✓) U(x) R(✓) D(-)

Interpretation:
- G(x): G is not in the word.
- O(✓): O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- U(x): U is not in the word.
- R(✓): R is in the word and in the correct position (position 4). We already knew R was at position 4, so this confirms.
- D(-): D is in the word but not in the correct position (since it's at position 5 in the guess, but the secret word has D somewhere else).

So, what we know now:
- The secret word has O in position 2 and R in position 4. So the pattern is: _ O _ R _
- The word contains D, but not in position 5 (because in ""gourd"", D was at position 5 and got '-', meaning it's present but misplaced).
- The word does not contain: C, A, N, E, S, H, I, T, G, U (all marked x in previous feedbacks).

Additionally, from the D(-) we know D is in the word but not at position 5.

Eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, S, H, I, T, G, U.

Available letters: B, D, F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: D is in the word, so we must use D. But D cannot be at position 5.

The pattern: position 1: ?, position 2: O, position 3: ?, position 4: R, position 5: ?

We know D is in the word, but not at position 5. So D must be in position 1 or 3? Because positions 2 and 4 are fixed as O and R.

So D can be at position 1 or 3.

Now, the word must be composed of the available letters, and we know D is one of them.

We also have to fill position 1, 3, and 5 with letters from the available set, but note that D is already used? Actually, we don't know if there are duplicate letters? But we haven't seen any duplicates so far? But we can't rule it out.

However, we know D is present, so at least one D.

Now, the available letters for positions 1, 3, 5: 
  - Position 1: can be any available letter except O and R? But O and R are fixed at 2 and 4. So position 1: B, D, F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and D is allowed here? but note D might be at position 1 or 3).
  - Position 3: similarly, available letters: B, D, F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and D can be here? but if D is at position 3, then we have to avoid using D again at position 5? unless duplicate? but we don't know).
  - Position 5: must be from the available letters, but D cannot be here (because of the feedback: D(-) and it was at position 5). So position 5: B, F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (no D).

But note: D is in the word, so it must appear at either position 1 or 3.

Now, we need to form a valid English word.

Let's list possible words:

Pattern: [1] O [3] R [5]

With [1] and [3] being from the available letters (and one of them must be D? because D is in the word) and [5] from available without D.

But note: D must be in the word, so either [1] is D or [3] is D.

Case 1: D at position 1 -> then word: D O [3] R [5]
  - [3] must be from available letters except D? because if D is at 1, then [3] can be any available except D? unless duplicate? but we don't know if duplicate is allowed? So we can have duplicate? But we haven't seen any feedback with duplicate? So we can't rule out? But to be safe, we can consider both.

But let's first assume no duplicate? Then if D is at 1, then [3] cannot be D? and [5] cannot be D? So [3] and [5] from: B, F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Similarly, if D is at position 3, then word: [1] O D R [5] -> [1] from available without D? and [5] without D.

But we must consider that D might be duplicated? But let's first try without.

Now, what words fit?

First, if D at position 1: D O ? R ?

Examples:
- DOGMA? But G and A eliminated -> no.
- DOWRY? D,O,W,R,Y -> but W and Y available? And R is at 4? D(1),O(2),W(3),R(4),Y(5). So this fits? But we have to check eliminated letters: D, O, W, R, Y -> D is at 1? But we have D at 1? Then W at 3? Y at 5? And eliminated letters: none of these are eliminated? 
  - D: is in the word? We know D is in the word? But in this case, D is at position 1? Then the feedback for ""gourd"" had D at position 5? But in the secret word, D is at position 1? So in ""gourd"", we had D at position 5? and the secret word has D at position 1? Then the feedback for D would be '-' meaning present but wrong position? Which matches.

So DOWRY is a candidate? But wait: in DOWRY, we have O at 2? R at 4? and D at 1? W at 3? Y at 5? 

But we have to check if W and Y are available? Yes, they are not eliminated.

But note: in the feedback for ""gourd"", we had D(-) meaning D is present but not at position 5? So if the word is DOWRY, then D is at 1? So that matches.

But is DOWRY a valid word? Yes.

Second case: D at position 3: then word: ? O D R ?

So [1] O D R [5]

[1] from available without D: B, F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
[5] from available without D: same.

Examples:
- BODER? Not a word.
- FODER? No.
- MODER? Not common? 
- PODEX? Not a word.
- RODEO? But R at position1? But we have R at position4? And O at2? D at3? Then E and O? But E eliminated? And also O at the end? But pattern: R(1),O(2),D(3),E(4),O(5) -> but we need R at4? Not at1? So no.
- How about ""JODEL""? J,O,D,E,L -> E eliminated -> no.
- ""VODKA"": V,O,D,K,A -> A eliminated -> no.
- ""WODGE"": W,O,D,G,E -> G and E eliminated -> no.
- ""YODEL"": Y,O,D,E,L -> E eliminated -> no.

So it seems hard to find a word with D at position 3? 

Another: ""BODLE""? Not a word.

""MODEL"": M,O,D,E,L -> E eliminated.

Therefore, the only candidate we have so far is DOWRY? But wait, are there others?

What about if D is at position 1? Other words:

- DOVER? D,O,V,E,R -> E eliminated -> no.
- DOZER? E -> no.
- DOPER? D,O,P,E,R -> E -> no.
- DOWLE? Not a word? 
- DOWLY? D,O,W,L,Y -> pattern: D(1),O(2),W(3),L(4),Y(5) -> but we need R at position4? Here position4 is L? So no.

But DOWRY has R at position4? So that's the only one we found? 

But what about DOWRY? We have DOWRY: D, O, W, R, Y -> positions: 1:D, 2:O, 3:W, 4:R, 5:Y.

But we have to check if W and Y are available? Yes.

But note: we have not tested W and Y? So we can guess DOWRY? But we have 6 tries? We can guess it? But we are at guess 4? So we can.

But we might want to get more information? Because if we are wrong, we have two more guesses? But we have a candidate? So we can guess it.

But let me see if there are other candidates? 

What about if D is at position 1? And we have other letters? 

For example: DOLLY? D,O,L,L,Y -> but position4 must be R? So we have L at position4? Not R? So no.

DOXIE? D,O,X,I,E -> I and E eliminated.

So DOWRY seems the only candidate? 

But wait: what about D at position 3? We didn't find any? 

Another possibility: ""MORDA""? M,O,R,D,A -> A eliminated -> no.

""FORDS"": F,O,R,D,S -> S eliminated -> no.

""YORDS""? Not a word.

""WORDY"": W,O,R,D,Y -> pattern: W(1),O(2),R(3),D(4),Y(5) -> but we need R at position4? Here R is at position3? So no.

""ROWDY"": R,O,W,D,Y -> R at position1? Not.

So the only candidate we have is DOWRY? 

But wait: what about ""DORMY""? D,O,R,M,Y -> pattern: D(1),O(2),R(3),M(4),Y(5) -> but we need R at position4? Here R is at position3? So no.

Therefore, DOWRY is the only candidate? 

But we have to consider that D might be duplicated? For example, if the word is ""DODGY""? But G eliminated -> no.

Or ""DUDED""? U and E eliminated -> no.

So I think DOWRY is the only candidate? 

But let me double-check: 

Pattern: _ O _ R _

With D in the word (not at position5) and not in the eliminated set.

Available letters: B, D, F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to fill position1,3,5.

Position1: can be D? Then position3: cannot be D? (if no duplicate) -> then W? and position5: Y? -> DOWRY.

If position1 is not D, then position3 must be D? Then position1: one of the available? and position5: one of the available? But we couldn't find any word? 

What about ""BODRY""? Not a word.

""FODRY""? No.

""JOWAR""? J,O,W,A,R -> A eliminated -> no.

""LORDY""? L,O,R,D,Y -> but R at position3? L(1),O(2),R(3),D(4),Y(5) -> but we need R at position4? So no.

""WORDY"": same issue.

So I think DOWRY is the only candidate? 

Therefore, we should guess DOWRY.

But note: we have to make sure that DOWRY is a valid word? Yes, it is (a dowry is a type of payment).

So let's guess DOWRY.

But we are at guess 4? We can guess it? 

Alternatively, we could try to get more information? But we have only one candidate? So we can guess it.

But what if the word is not DOWRY? Then we have two more guesses? But we don't have other candidates? So we must guess DOWRY.

So <guess>dowry</guess>

But let me see: the feedback for ""gourd"" had D(-) meaning D is present but not at position5? In DOWRY, D is at position1? So that matches.

Also, O and R are correct? So in DOWRY, O at2 and R at4? So they should be correct? 

Therefore, we are confident.

So the guess is DOWRY.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: R is in the word but not in position 2; C, A, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (shirt)**: R is in position 4 (correct); S, H, I, T are absent.
- **Guess 3 (gourd)**: O is in position 2 (correct), R is in position 4 (confirmed), D is present but not in position 5; G and U are absent.
