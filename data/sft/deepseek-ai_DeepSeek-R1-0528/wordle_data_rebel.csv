We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R is not the second letter, and E is not the fifth letter.
 - The letters C, A, N are not in the word at all.

 Since we have 6 tries, we can use this information to make a second guess.

 We need to choose a word that:
 1. Includes R and E (since they are in the secret word) but in different positions than in ""crane"".
    - R was in position 2, so in the new guess, R should not be in position 2? Actually, it can be in any position except that we know it's not the second? 
      But note: the feedback says R is in the word but not in position 2. So R must be in one of positions 1,3,4,5? Actually, no: the feedback only tells us about the position we guessed. 
      It doesn't prevent R from being in position 2? Wait, no: because if R were in position 2, it would have been marked as correct (✓). But it was marked as present but wrong position (-), so R is in the word but not at position 2.

 2. Does not include C, A, N.

 Also, we want to include other common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, H, etc.

 We know the word has 5 letters. We have two known letters: R and E.

 We can try to put R and E in positions that are not the ones we already tried (so R not at position 2, and E not at position 5).

 Also, we have three positions that were wrong: positions 1,3,4 (because we had C, A, N there and they are absent). But note: the feedback doesn't tell us about the positions of the absent letters, only that they are absent.

 So, for the next guess, we can try:

 Let me try to think of a word that has R and E, and three new letters.

 Example: ""ROUTE"" -> but we have O, U, T. However, note that we don't know if O, U, T are in the word. Also, we must avoid A and N? Actually, we know A and N are not in the word, so we can use other letters.

 But wait: we also know that the word does not have C, A, N. So we can use any letters except C, A, N.

 However, we must be cautious: we don't want to reuse letters that we know are absent? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we know they are not in the word. So we avoid C, A, N.

 Let me try to form a word:

 We have to place R and E. Since R was not at position 2, we can try R at position 1? But note: we don't know if position 1 is R or not. Similarly, E was not at position 5, so we can try E at position 1? But that might be unusual.

 Alternatively, we can try to put R at position 3 or 4 or 5? But note: in the first guess, position 5 was E and it was present but wrong, so E is not at position 5. But we don't know about position 1,3,4 for R.

 However, we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But the feedback doesn't indicate that, so we assume no duplicates for now.

 Let me think of words without C, A, N, and with R and E.

 Some possibilities: 
 - ""TRIED"": T, R, I, E, D -> but R is at position 2? We know R is not at position 2? Actually, we know from the first guess that R is not at position 2. But in this new word, if we put R at position 2, then we are repeating the same mistake? We know R is not at position 2, so we should avoid putting R at position 2.

 So in ""TRIED"", R is at position 2 -> that's the same position we already tried and it was wrong. So we should avoid that.

 How about ""RIDER""? But that has two R's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but typically in Wordle, duplicates are possible. However, the feedback for the first guess didn't show two R's? Actually, we only had one R. So if the word has two R's, then when we guessed ""crane"" (which has one R) we would have only gotten one R marked? But the feedback only marks the letters that are present. So if the word has two R's and we guess one, we get one R marked. So duplicates are possible.

 But to keep it simple, let's avoid duplicates for now.

 Another word: ""STREP"" -> but we have S, T, R, E, P. And R is at position 3? That's a new position. E is at position 4? Also, we avoid position 2 for R and position 5 for E? Actually, in ""STREP"":
   position 1: S
   position 2: T
   position 3: R -> that's okay because we haven't tried R at position 3? And we know R is not at position 2, but position 3 is new.
   position 4: E -> and we know E is not at position 5, but position 4 is new.
   position 5: P

 But note: we also have to check if S, T, P are in the word? We don't know. This guess will help us.

 However, we must make sure the word is valid. ""STREP"" is a valid word (meaning a type of bacteria).

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROGUE"": 
   R at position 1 (which is new for R) and E at position 5? But wait, we know E is not at position 5? Because in the first guess, we had E at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong. So if we put E at position 5 again, we know it's wrong? But we can do that to test? Actually, we can, but it might be inefficient.

 However, the feedback for E at position 5 was that it is present but not at that position. So if we put E at position 5 again, we will get the same feedback? That is, we won't get a check for E at position 5 because we know it's not there. So it's better to try E in a new position.

 Therefore, we should avoid putting E at position 5. Similarly, avoid R at position 2.

 So ""ROGUE"" has E at position 5 -> not good.

 How about ""DRIVE"": 
   D at 1, R at 2 -> but R at position 2 is the same as before? We know R is not at position 2, so we avoid that.

 How about ""PRICE"": but we know C is not in the word? So we cannot use C.

 How about ""TRIPE"": 
   T, R, I, P, E
   R at position 2 -> again, we know R is not at position 2? So we avoid.

 We need a word that has R not at position 2 and E not at position 5.

 Let me try: ""PERKY"" -> P, E, R, K, Y
   E at position 2? We don't know about position 2 for E? But we know E is in the word, but not at position 5. We don't know about other positions.
   R at position 3? That's new.

 But note: we also have to avoid A, C, N. This word doesn't have them.

 However, we have Y and K? They are less common, but okay.

 Alternatively, ""ROBES"": 
   R at 1, O, B, E at 4, S at 5 -> E is at position 4? That's new. And R at position 1? That's new.

 But we don't know if O, B, S are in the word.

 Another common word: ""STORE"": 
   S, T, O, R, E -> but R is at position 4? and E at position 5? We know E is not at position 5? So we avoid E at position 5.

 How about ""STOLE"": 
   S, T, O, L, E -> but we don't have R? We must include R because we know it's in the word.

 So we need a word that has R and E, and avoids C, A, N.

 Let me think: ""RIPER""? But that has two R's? And E at the end? We know E is not at position 5? So we avoid.

 How about ""RIPEN""? But we know N is not in the word? So we cannot use N.

 How about ""RIPED""? Not a common word? Actually, ""riped"" is not a standard word. We need valid words.

 Another idea: ""BREAD"" -> but we have A? We know A is not in the word? So we cannot use A.

 How about ""BREED""? But that has two E's? And we don't know if duplicates are there? Also, E at position 5? We know E is not at position 5? So avoid.

 How about ""BRUTE"": 
   B, R, U, T, E -> 
   R at position 2? We know R is not at position 2? So avoid.

 How about ""URGED"": 
   U, R, G, E, D -> 
   R at position 2? Again, same problem.

 How about ""TRIES"": 
   T, R, I, E, S -> 
   R at position 2? Avoid.

 How about ""RESIN"": but we know N is not in the word? So no.

 How about ""RESET"": 
   R, E, S, E, T -> has two E's? And we have E at position 2? We don't know if that's allowed? But also, we know E is in the word, but we don't know if there are two. 
   However, we also have E at position 5? We know E is not at position 5? So the second E at position 5 would be wrong? But we are trying to get information.

 But note: we are limited to 5 letters and we know the word has at least one R and one E. We don't know about duplicates.

 Alternatively, we can try ""RODEO""? But that has O and D? And no E? We need E.

 After some thought, I found: ""PRIED"": 
   P, R, I, E, D -> 
   R at position 2? Avoid.

 How about ""WROTE"": 
   W, R, O, T, E -> 
   R at position 2? Avoid.

 How about ""CRWTH""? Not common and we know C is not in the word.

 Another idea: ""EMPTY"" -> but no R? We must have R.

 How about ""RESTY"": 
   R, E, S, T, Y -> 
   R at position 1? That's new.
   E at position 2? We don't know about position 2 for E? It could be correct? 
   But note: we know R is in the word, but we don't know if it can be at position 1? We haven't tried position 1 for R.

 However, we also have to avoid the known absent letters: C, A, N. This word is okay.

 But wait: we have E at position 2? We don't have any information about E at position 2. It might be correct? Or it might be present but in the wrong position? We don't know.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROUSE"": 
   R, O, U, S, E -> 
   R at position 1? New.
   E at position 5? We know E is not at position 5? So we avoid.

 How about ""ROBED"": 
   R, O, B, E, D -> 
   R at 1, E at 4? That's new for E (previously we had E at 5, now at 4). So that's good.

 So ""ROBED"" seems acceptable.

 But let me check: 
   R at 1: we haven't tried that.
   O, B: new letters.
   E at 4: we haven't tried that.

 So we can use ""ROBED"".

 However, we might get more information if we use a word that has more common consonants? Like S, T, L.

 Another candidate: ""TRIBE"" -> but we have A? No, T, R, I, B, E -> 
   R at position 2? Avoid.

 How about ""STIRE""? Not a word.

 How about ""SERIF"": 
   S, E, R, I, F -> 
   E at position 2? 
   R at position 3? That's new.

 This word: ""SERIF"" is valid.

 But we have E at position 2? We don't know if that's correct? And R at position 3? We know R is in the word but not at position 2, so position 3 is a candidate.

 Also, we are testing S, E, R, I, F.

 Alternatively, ""RICES"" -> but we know C is not in the word? So no.

 After considering, I think ""ROBED"" is a valid choice, but let me see if we can do better.

 How about ""PRIDE"": 
   P, R, I, D, E -> 
   R at position 2? Avoid.

 How about ""DRIVE"": 
   D, R, I, V, E -> 
   R at position 2? Avoid.

 How about ""GRIME"": 
   G, R, I, M, E -> 
   R at position 2? Avoid.

 How about ""OPTER""? Not common.

 Another idea: ""REMIT"": 
   R, E, M, I, T -> 
   R at position 1? New.
   E at position 2? New.

 This is acceptable? But we have E at position 2? We don't know if that's correct? But we are testing.

 However, we are not repeating the same positions for R and E? R is at 1 (new) and E is at 2 (we haven't tried E at 2 before). 

 Also, we are testing M, I, T.

 But note: we know the word has R and E, so we are covering that.

 Alternatively, ""REBUS"": 
   R, E, B, U, S -> 
   R at 1, E at 2? Same as above.

 But we are testing B, U, S.

 I think ""REBUS"" is a valid word (meaning a puzzle).

 However, we are using E at position 2? We don't have any information that E is not at position 2? So it's okay.

 But we might get more information if we use a word that has the R and E in positions that are more likely to be correct? Actually, we don't know.

 Another common word: ""ADIEU"" -> but we know A is not in the word? So no.

 After careful thought, I choose ""ROBED"". 

 Why? 
 - It has R at position 1 (which we haven't tried) and E at position 4 (which is new, since we only know E is not at 5).
 - It avoids the letters C, A, N.
 - It uses new common letters: O, B, D.

 So, second guess: ""ROBED""

 Let me write it: 
   R at 1, O at 2, B at 3, E at 4, D at 5.

 We hope to get feedback on these.

 If the feedback shows:
   If R at 1 is correct, we get a check.
   If E at 4 is correct, we get a check.

 And we'll know about O, B, D.

 So, I'll go with ""ROBED"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and N are not in the word (marked ""x"").
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (marked ""-"").
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include R and E (since they are in the secret word), but avoid placing R in position 2 or E in position 5.
- Must exclude C, A, and N (since they are absent).
- Aim to test new common letters (e.g., B, O, D) and new positions for R and E.

The word ""ROBED"" fits these criteria:
- Places R in position 1 (new position, not tested before).
- Places E in position 4 (new position, avoiding position 5).
- Uses new letters: O, B, D (all untested).
- Excludes C, A, N.

This guess will help identify the positions of R and E while testing three new letters.

<guess>robed</guess>",robed,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".

 Another word: ""STREP"" -> but we have S, T, R, E, P. And R is at position 3? That's a new position. E is at position 4? Also, we avoid position 2 for R and position 5 for E? Actually, in ""STREP"":
   position 1: S
   position 2: T
   position 3: R -> that's okay because we haven't tried R at position 3? And we know R is not at position 2, but position 3 is new.

   R at position 2 -> again, we know R is not at position 2? So we avoid.

 We need a word that has R not at position 2 and E not at position 5.

 Let me try: ""PERKY"" -> P, E, R, K, Y
   E at position 2? We don't know about position 2 for E? But we know E is in the word, but not at position 5. We don't know about other positions.
   R at position 3? That's new.

 But note: we also have to avoid A, C, N. This word doesn't have them.

 However, we have Y and K? They are less common, but okay.

 Alternatively, ""ROBES"": 
   R at 1, O, B, E at 4, S at 5 -> E is at position 4? That's new. And R at position 1? That's new.

 But we don't know if O, B, S are in the word.

 Another common word: ""STORE"": 
   S, T, O, R, E -> but R is at position 4? and E at position 5? We know E is not at position 5? So we avoid E at position 5.

 How about ""STOLE"": 
   S, T, O, L, E -> but we don't have R? We must include R because we know it's in the word.

 So we need a word that has R and E, and avoids C, A, N.

 Let me think: ""RIPER""? But that has two R's? And E at the end? We know E is not at position 5? So we avoid.

 How about ""RIPEN""? But we know N is not in the word? So we cannot use N.

 How about ""RIPED""? Not a common word? Actually, ""riped"" is not a standard word. We need valid words.

 Another idea: ""BREAD"" -> but we have A? We know A is not in the word? So we cannot use A.

 How about ""BREED""? But that has two E's? And we don't know if duplicates are there? Also, E at position 5? We know E is not at position 5? So avoid.

 How about ""BRUTE"": 
   B, R, U, T, E -> 
   R at position 2? We know R is not at position 2? So avoid.

 How about ""URGED"": 
   U, R, G, E, D -> 
   R at position 2? Again, same problem.

 How about ""TRIES"": 
   T, R, I, E, S -> 
   R at position 2? Avoid.

 How about ""RESIN"": but we know N is not in the word? So no.

 How about ""RESET"": 
   R, E, S, E, T -> has two E's? And we have E at position 2? We don't know if that's allowed? But also, we know E is in the word, but we don't know if there are two. 
   However, we also have E at position 5? We know E is not at position 5? So the second E at position 5 would be wrong? But we are trying to get information.

 But note: we are limited to 5 letters and we know the word has at least one R and one E. We don't know about duplicates.

 Alternatively, we can try ""RODEO""? But that has O and D? And no E? We need E.

 After some thought, I found: ""PRIED"": 
   P, R, I, E, D -> 
   R at position 2? Avoid.

 How about ""WROTE"": 
   W, R, O, T, E -> 
   R at position 2? Avoid.

 How about ""CRWTH""? Not common and we know C is not in the word.

 Another idea: ""EMPTY"" -> but no R? We must have R.

 How about ""RESTY"": 
   R, E, S, T, Y -> 
   R at position 1? That's new.
   E at position 2? We don't know about position 2 for E? It could be correct? 
   But note: we know R is in the word, but we don't know if it can be at position 1? We haven't tried position 1 for R.

 However, we also have to avoid the known absent letters: C, A, N. This word is okay.

 But wait: we have E at position 2? We don't have any information about E at position 2. It might be correct? Or it might be present but in the wrong position? We don't know.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROUSE"": 
   R, O, U, S, E -> 
   R at position 1? New.
   E at position 5? We know E is not at position 5? So we avoid.

 How about ""ROBED"": 
   R, O, B, E, D -> 
   R at 1, E at 4? That's new for E (previously we had E at 5, now at 4). So that's good.

 So ""ROBED"" seems acceptable.

 But let me check: 
   R at 1: we haven't tried that.
   O, B: new letters.
   E at 4: we haven't tried that.

 So we can use ""ROBED"".

 However, we might get more information if we use a word that has more common consonants? Like S, T, L.

 Another candidate: ""TRIBE"" -> but we have A? No, T, R, I, B, E -> 
   R at position 2? Avoid.

 How about ""STIRE""? Not a word.

 How about ""SERIF"": 
   S, E, R, I, F -> 
   E at position 2? 
   R at position 3? That's new.

 This word: ""SERIF"" is valid.

 But we have E at position 2? We don't know if that's correct? And R at position 3? We know R is in the word but not at position 2, so position 3 is a candidate.

 Also, we are testing S, E, R, I, F.

 Alternatively, ""RICES"" -> but we know C is not in the word? So no.

 After considering, I think ""ROBED"" is a valid choice, but let me see if we can do better.

 How about ""PRIDE"": 
   P, R, I, D, E -> 
   R at position 2? Avoid.

 How about ""DRIVE"": 
   D, R, I, V, E -> 
   R at position 2? Avoid.

 How about ""GRIME"": 
   G, R, I, M, E -> 
   R at position 2? Avoid.

 How about ""OPTER""? Not common.

 Another idea: ""REMIT"": 
   R, E, M, I, T -> 
   R at position 1? New.
   E at position 2? New.

 This is acceptable? But we have E at position 2? We don't know if that's correct? But we are testing.

 However, we are not repeating the same positions for R and E? R is at 1 (new) and E is at 2 (we haven't tried E at 2 before). 

 Also, we are testing M, I, T.

 But note: we know the word has R and E, so we are covering that.

 Alternatively, ""REBUS"": 
   R, E, B, U, S -> 
   R at 1, E at 2? Same as above.

 But we are testing B, U, S.

 I think ""REBUS"" is a valid word (meaning a puzzle).

 However, we are using E at position 2? We don't have any information that E is not at position 2? So it's okay.

 But we might get more information if we use a word that has the R and E in positions that are more likely to be correct? Actually, we don't know.

 Another common word: ""ADIEU"" -> but we know A is not in the word? So no.

 After careful thought, I choose ""ROBED"". 

 Why? 
 - It has R at position 1 (which we haven't tried) and E at position 4 (which is new, since we only know E is not at 5).
 - It avoids the letters C, A, N.
 - It uses new common letters: O, B, D.

 So, second guess: ""ROBED""

 Let me write it: 
   R at 1, O at 2, B at 3, E at 4, D at 5.

 We hope to get feedback on these.

 If the feedback shows:
   If R at 1 is correct, we get a check.
   If E at 4 is correct, we get a check.

 And we'll know about O, B, D.

 So, I'll go with ""ROBED"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and N are not in the word (marked ""x"").
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (marked ""-"").
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include R and E (since they are in the secret word), but avoid placing R in position 2 or E in position 5.
- Must exclude C, A, and N (since they are absent).
- Aim to test new common letters (e.g., B, O, D) and new positions for R and E.

The word ""ROBED"" fits these criteria:
- Places R in position 1 (new position, not tested before).
- Places E in position 4 (new position, avoiding position 5).
- Uses new letters: O, B, D (all untested).
- Excludes C, A, N.

This guess will help identify the positions of R and E while testing three new letters.",Guess 2: robed -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) O(x) B(✓) E(✓) D(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,rebel,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R is not the second letter, and E is not the fifth letter.
 - The letters C, A, N are not in the word at all.

 Since we have 6 tries, we can use this information to make a second guess.

 We need to choose a word that:
 1. Includes R and E (since they are in the secret word) but in different positions than in ""crane"".
    - R was in position 2, so in the new guess, R should not be in position 2? Actually, it can be in any position except that we know it's not the second? 
      But note: the feedback says R is in the word but not in position 2. So R must be in one of positions 1,3,4,5? Actually, no: the feedback only tells us about the position we guessed. 
      It doesn't prevent R from being in position 2? Wait, no: because if R were in position 2, it would have been marked as correct (✓). But it was marked as present but wrong position (-), so R is in the word but not at position 2.

 2. Does not include C, A, N.

 Also, we want to include other common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, H, etc.

 We know the word has 5 letters. We have two known letters: R and E.

 We can try to put R and E in positions that are not the ones we already tried (so R not at position 2, and E not at position 5).

 Also, we have three positions that were wrong: positions 1,3,4 (because we had C, A, N there and they are absent). But note: the feedback doesn't tell us about the positions of the absent letters, only that they are absent.

 So, for the next guess, we can try:

 Let me try to think of a word that has R and E, and three new letters.

 Example: ""ROUTE"" -> but we have O, U, T. However, note that we don't know if O, U, T are in the word. Also, we must avoid A and N? Actually, we know A and N are not in the word, so we can use other letters.

 But wait: we also know that the word does not have C, A, N. So we can use any letters except C, A, N.

 However, we must be cautious: we don't want to reuse letters that we know are absent? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we know they are not in the word. So we avoid C, A, N.

 Let me try to form a word:

 We have to place R and E. Since R was not at position 2, we can try R at position 1? But note: we don't know if position 1 is R or not. Similarly, E was not at position 5, so we can try E at position 1? But that might be unusual.

 Alternatively, we can try to put R at position 3 or 4 or 5? But note: in the first guess, position 5 was E and it was present but wrong, so E is not at position 5. But we don't know about position 1,3,4 for R.

 However, we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But the feedback doesn't indicate that, so we assume no duplicates for now.

 Let me think of words without C, A, N, and with R and E.

 Some possibilities: 
 - ""TRIED"": T, R, I, E, D -> but R is at position 2? We know R is not at position 2? Actually, we know from the first guess that R is not at position 2. But in this new word, if we put R at position 2, then we are repeating the same mistake? We know R is not at position 2, so we should avoid putting R at position 2.

 So in ""TRIED"", R is at position 2 -> that's the same position we already tried and it was wrong. So we should avoid that.

 How about ""RIDER""? But that has two R's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but typically in Wordle, duplicates are possible. However, the feedback for the first guess didn't show two R's? Actually, we only had one R. So if the word has two R's, then when we guessed ""crane"" (which has one R) we would have only gotten one R marked? But the feedback only marks the letters that are present. So if the word has two R's and we guess one, we get one R marked. So duplicates are possible.

 But to keep it simple, let's avoid duplicates for now.

 Another word: ""STREP"" -> but we have S, T, R, E, P. And R is at position 3? That's a new position. E is at position 4? Also, we avoid position 2 for R and position 5 for E? Actually, in ""STREP"":
   position 1: S
   position 2: T
   position 3: R -> that's okay because we haven't tried R at position 3? And we know R is not at position 2, but position 3 is new.
   position 4: E -> and we know E is not at position 5, but position 4 is new.
   position 5: P

 But note: we also have to check if S, T, P are in the word? We don't know. This guess will help us.

 However, we must make sure the word is valid. ""STREP"" is a valid word (meaning a type of bacteria).

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROGUE"": 
   R at position 1 (which is new for R) and E at position 5? But wait, we know E is not at position 5? Because in the first guess, we had E at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong. So if we put E at position 5 again, we know it's wrong? But we can do that to test? Actually, we can, but it might be inefficient.

 However, the feedback for E at position 5 was that it is present but not at that position. So if we put E at position 5 again, we will get the same feedback? That is, we won't get a check for E at position 5 because we know it's not there. So it's better to try E in a new position.

 Therefore, we should avoid putting E at position 5. Similarly, avoid R at position 2.

 So ""ROGUE"" has E at position 5 -> not good.

 How about ""DRIVE"": 
   D at 1, R at 2 -> but R at position 2 is the same as before? We know R is not at position 2, so we avoid that.

 How about ""PRICE"": but we know C is not in the word? So we cannot use C.

 How about ""TRIPE"": 
   T, R, I, P, E
   R at position 2 -> again, we know R is not at position 2? So we avoid.

 We need a word that has R not at position 2 and E not at position 5.

 Let me try: ""PERKY"" -> P, E, R, K, Y
   E at position 2? We don't know about position 2 for E? But we know E is in the word, but not at position 5. We don't know about other positions.
   R at position 3? That's new.

 But note: we also have to avoid A, C, N. This word doesn't have them.

 However, we have Y and K? They are less common, but okay.

 Alternatively, ""ROBES"": 
   R at 1, O, B, E at 4, S at 5 -> E is at position 4? That's new. And R at position 1? That's new.

 But we don't know if O, B, S are in the word.

 Another common word: ""STORE"": 
   S, T, O, R, E -> but R is at position 4? and E at position 5? We know E is not at position 5? So we avoid E at position 5.

 How about ""STOLE"": 
   S, T, O, L, E -> but we don't have R? We must include R because we know it's in the word.

 So we need a word that has R and E, and avoids C, A, N.

 Let me think: ""RIPER""? But that has two R's? And E at the end? We know E is not at position 5? So we avoid.

 How about ""RIPEN""? But we know N is not in the word? So we cannot use N.

 How about ""RIPED""? Not a common word? Actually, ""riped"" is not a standard word. We need valid words.

 Another idea: ""BREAD"" -> but we have A? We know A is not in the word? So we cannot use A.

 How about ""BREED""? But that has two E's? And we don't know if duplicates are there? Also, E at position 5? We know E is not at position 5? So avoid.

 How about ""BRUTE"": 
   B, R, U, T, E -> 
   R at position 2? We know R is not at position 2? So avoid.

 How about ""URGED"": 
   U, R, G, E, D -> 
   R at position 2? Again, same problem.

 How about ""TRIES"": 
   T, R, I, E, S -> 
   R at position 2? Avoid.

 How about ""RESIN"": but we know N is not in the word? So no.

 How about ""RESET"": 
   R, E, S, E, T -> has two E's? And we have E at position 2? We don't know if that's allowed? But also, we know E is in the word, but we don't know if there are two. 
   However, we also have E at position 5? We know E is not at position 5? So the second E at position 5 would be wrong? But we are trying to get information.

 But note: we are limited to 5 letters and we know the word has at least one R and one E. We don't know about duplicates.

 Alternatively, we can try ""RODEO""? But that has O and D? And no E? We need E.

 After some thought, I found: ""PRIED"": 
   P, R, I, E, D -> 
   R at position 2? Avoid.

 How about ""WROTE"": 
   W, R, O, T, E -> 
   R at position 2? Avoid.

 How about ""CRWTH""? Not common and we know C is not in the word.

 Another idea: ""EMPTY"" -> but no R? We must have R.

 How about ""RESTY"": 
   R, E, S, T, Y -> 
   R at position 1? That's new.
   E at position 2? We don't know about position 2 for E? It could be correct? 
   But note: we know R is in the word, but we don't know if it can be at position 1? We haven't tried position 1 for R.

 However, we also have to avoid the known absent letters: C, A, N. This word is okay.

 But wait: we have E at position 2? We don't have any information about E at position 2. It might be correct? Or it might be present but in the wrong position? We don't know.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROUSE"": 
   R, O, U, S, E -> 
   R at position 1? New.
   E at position 5? We know E is not at position 5? So we avoid.

 How about ""ROBED"": 
   R, O, B, E, D -> 
   R at 1, E at 4? That's new for E (previously we had E at 5, now at 4). So that's good.

 So ""ROBED"" seems acceptable.

 But let me check: 
   R at 1: we haven't tried that.
   O, B: new letters.
   E at 4: we haven't tried that.

 So we can use ""ROBED"".

 However, we might get more information if we use a word that has more common consonants? Like S, T, L.

 Another candidate: ""TRIBE"" -> but we have A? No, T, R, I, B, E -> 
   R at position 2? Avoid.

 How about ""STIRE""? Not a word.

 How about ""SERIF"": 
   S, E, R, I, F -> 
   E at position 2? 
   R at position 3? That's new.

 This word: ""SERIF"" is valid.

 But we have E at position 2? We don't know if that's correct? And R at position 3? We know R is in the word but not at position 2, so position 3 is a candidate.

 Also, we are testing S, E, R, I, F.

 Alternatively, ""RICES"" -> but we know C is not in the word? So no.

 After considering, I think ""ROBED"" is a valid choice, but let me see if we can do better.

 How about ""PRIDE"": 
   P, R, I, D, E -> 
   R at position 2? Avoid.

 How about ""DRIVE"": 
   D, R, I, V, E -> 
   R at position 2? Avoid.

 How about ""GRIME"": 
   G, R, I, M, E -> 
   R at position 2? Avoid.

 How about ""OPTER""? Not common.

 Another idea: ""REMIT"": 
   R, E, M, I, T -> 
   R at position 1? New.
   E at position 2? New.

 This is acceptable? But we have E at position 2? We don't know if that's correct? But we are testing.

 However, we are not repeating the same positions for R and E? R is at 1 (new) and E is at 2 (we haven't tried E at 2 before). 

 Also, we are testing M, I, T.

 But note: we know the word has R and E, so we are covering that.

 Alternatively, ""REBUS"": 
   R, E, B, U, S -> 
   R at 1, E at 2? Same as above.

 But we are testing B, U, S.

 I think ""REBUS"" is a valid word (meaning a puzzle).

 However, we are using E at position 2? We don't have any information that E is not at position 2? So it's okay.

 But we might get more information if we use a word that has the R and E in positions that are more likely to be correct? Actually, we don't know.

 Another common word: ""ADIEU"" -> but we know A is not in the word? So no.

 After careful thought, I choose ""ROBED"". 

 Why? 
 - It has R at position 1 (which we haven't tried) and E at position 4 (which is new, since we only know E is not at 5).
 - It avoids the letters C, A, N.
 - It uses new common letters: O, B, D.

 So, second guess: ""ROBED""

 Let me write it: 
   R at 1, O at 2, B at 3, E at 4, D at 5.

 We hope to get feedback on these.

 If the feedback shows:
   If R at 1 is correct, we get a check.
   If E at 4 is correct, we get a check.

 And we'll know about O, B, D.

 So, I'll go with ""ROBED"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and N are not in the word (marked ""x"").
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (marked ""-"").
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include R and E (since they are in the secret word), but avoid placing R in position 2 or E in position 5.
- Must exclude C, A, and N (since they are absent).
- Aim to test new common letters (e.g., B, O, D) and new positions for R and E.

The word ""ROBED"" fits these criteria:
- Places R in position 1 (new position, not tested before).
- Places E in position 4 (new position, avoiding position 5).
- Uses new letters: O, B, D (all untested).
- Excludes C, A, N.

This guess will help identify the positions of R and E while testing three new letters.

Includes R and E (since they are in the secret word) but in different positions than in ""crane"".\n    - R was in position 2, so in the new guess, R should not be in position 2? Actually, it can be in any position except that we know it\'s not the second? \n      But note: the feedback says R is in the word but not in position 2. So R must be in one of positions 1,3,4,5? Actually, no: the feedback only tells us about the position we guessed. \n      It doesn\'t prevent R from being in position 2? Wait, no: because if R were in position 2, it would have been marked as correct (✓). But it was marked as present but wrong position (-), so R is in the word but not at position 2.\n\n 2. Does not include C, A, N.\n\n Also, we want to include other common letters to get more information.\n\n Let\'s think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N.\n\n Common letters we haven\'t tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, H, etc.\n\n We know the word has 5 letters. We have two known letters: R and E.\n\n We can try to put R and E in positions that are not the ones we already tried (so R not at position 2, and E not at position 5).\n\n Also, we have three positions that were wrong: positions 1,3,4 (because we had C, A, N there and they are absent). But note: the feedback doesn\'t tell us about the positions of the absent letters, only that they are absent.\n\n So, for the next guess, we can try:\n\n Let me try to think of a word that has R and E, and three new letters.\n\n Example: ""ROUTE"" -> but we have O, U, T. However, note that we don\'t know if O, U, T are in the word. Also, we must avoid A and N? Actually, we know A and N are not in the word, so we can use other letters.\n\n But wait: we also know that the word does not have C, A, N. So we can use any letters except C, A, N.\n\n However, we must be cautious: we don\'t want to reuse letters that we know are absent? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we know they are not in the word. So we avoid C, A, N.\n\n Let me try to form a word:\n\n We have to place R and E. Since R was not at position 2, we can try R at position 1? But note: we don\'t know if position 1 is R or not. Similarly, E was not at position 5, so we can try E at position 1? But that might be unusual.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to put R at position 3 or 4 or 5? But note: in the first guess, position 5 was E and it was present but wrong, so E is not at position 5. But we don\'t know about position 1,3,4 for R.\n\n However, we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But the feedback doesn\'t indicate that, so we assume no duplicates for now.\n\n Let me think of words without C, A, N, and with R and E.\n\n Some possibilities: \n - ""TRIED"": T, R, I, E, D -> but R is at position 2? We know R is not at position 2? Actually, we know from the first guess that R is not at position 2. But in this new word, if we put R at position 2, then we are repeating the same mistake? We know R is not at position 2, so we should avoid putting R at position 2.\n\n So in ""TRIED"", R is at position 2 -> that\'s the same position we already tried and it was wrong. So we should avoid that.\n\n How about ""RIDER""? But that has two R\'s? We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed, but typically in Wordle, duplicates are possible. However, the feedback for the first guess didn\'t show two R\'s? Actually, we only had one R. So if the word has two R\'s, then when we guessed ""crane"" (which has one R) we would have only gotten one R marked? But the feedback only marks the letters that are present. So if the word has two R\'s and we guess one, we get one R marked. So duplicates are possible.\n\n But to keep it simple, let\'s avoid duplicates for now.\n\n Another word: ""STREP"" -> but we have S, T, R, E, P. And R is at position 3? That\'s a new position. E is at position 4? Also, we avoid position 2 for R and position 5 for E? Actually, in ""STREP"":\n   position 1: S\n   position 2: T\n   position 3: R -> that\'s okay because we haven\'t tried R at position 3? And we know R is not at position 2, but position 3 is new.\n   position 4: E -> and we know E is not at position 5, but position 4 is new.\n   position 5: P\n\n But note: we also have to check if S, T, P are in the word? We don\'t know. This guess will help us.\n\n However, we must make sure the word is valid. ""STREP"" is a valid word (meaning a type of bacteria).\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""ROGUE"": \n   R at position 1 (which is new for R) and E at position 5? But wait, we know E is not at position 5? Because in the first guess, we had E at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong. So if we put E at position 5 again, we know it\'s wrong? But we can do that to test? Actually, we can, but it might be inefficient.\n\n However, the feedback for E at position 5 was that it is present but not at that position. So if we put E at position 5 again, we will get the same feedback? That is, we won\'t get a check for E at position 5 because we know it\'s not there. So it\'s better to try E in a new position.\n\n Therefore, we should avoid putting E at position 5. Similarly, avoid R at position 2.\n\n So ""ROGUE"" has E at position 5 -> not good.\n\n How about ""DRIVE"": \n   D at 1, R at 2 -> but R at position 2 is the same as before? We know R is not at position 2, so we avoid that.\n\n How about ""PRICE"": but we know C is not in the word? So we cannot use C.\n\n How about ""TRIPE"": \n   T, R, I, P, E\n   R at position 2 -> again, we know R is not at position 2? So we avoid.\n\n We need a word that has R not at position 2 and E not at position 5.\n\n Let me try: ""PERKY"" -> P, E, R, K, Y\n   E at position 2? We don\'t know about position 2 for E? But we know E is in the word, but not at position 5. We don\'t know about other positions.\n   R at position 3? That\'s new.\n\n But note: we also have to avoid A, C, N. This word doesn\'t have them.\n\n However, we have Y and K? They are less common, but okay.\n\n Alternatively, ""ROBES"": \n   R at 1, O, B, E at 4, S at 5 -> E is at position 4? That\'s new. And R at position 1? That\'s new.\n\n But we don\'t know if O, B, S are in the word.\n\n Another common word: ""STORE"": \n   S, T, O, R, E -> but R is at position 4? and E at position 5? We know E is not at position 5? So we avoid E at position 5.\n\n How about ""STOLE"": \n   S, T, O, L, E -> but we don\'t have R? We must include R because we know it\'s in the word.\n\n So we need a word that has R and E, and avoids C, A, N.\n\n Let me think: ""RIPER""? But that has two R\'s? And E at the end? We know E is not at position 5? So we avoid.\n\n How about ""RIPEN""? But we know N is not in the word? So we cannot use N.\n\n How about ""RIPED""? Not a common word? Actually, ""riped"" is not a standard word. We need valid words.\n\n Another idea: ""BREAD"" -> but we have A? We know A is not in the word? So we cannot use A.\n\n How about ""BREED""? But that has two E\'s? And we don\'t know if duplicates are there? Also, E at position 5? We know E is not at position 5? So avoid.\n\n How about ""BRUTE"": \n   B, R, U, T, E -> \n   R at position 2? We know R is not at position 2? So avoid.\n\n How about ""URGED"": \n   U, R, G, E, D -> \n   R at position 2? Again, same problem.\n\n How about ""TRIES"": \n   T, R, I, E, S -> \n   R at position 2? Avoid.\n\n How about ""RESIN"": but we know N is not in the word? So no.\n\n How about ""RESET"": \n   R, E, S, E, T -> has two E\'s? And we have E at position 2? We don\'t know if that\'s allowed? But also, we know E is in the word, but we don\'t know if there are two. \n   However, we also have E at position 5? We know E is not at position 5? So the second E at position 5 would be wrong? But we are trying to get information.\n\n But note: we are limited to 5 letters and we know the word has at least one R and one E. We don\'t know about duplicates.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""RODEO""? But that has O and D? And no E? We need E.\n\n After some thought, I found: ""PRIED"": \n   P, R, I, E, D -> \n   R at position 2? Avoid.\n\n How about ""WROTE"": \n   W, R, O, T, E -> \n   R at position 2? Avoid.\n\n How about ""CRWTH""? Not common and we know C is not in the word.\n\n Another idea: ""EMPTY"" -> but no R? We must have R.\n\n How about ""RESTY"": \n   R, E, S, T, Y -> \n   R at position 1? That\'s new.\n   E at position 2? We don\'t know about position 2 for E? It could be correct? \n   But note: we know R is in the word, but we don\'t know if it can be at position 1? We haven\'t tried position 1 for R.\n\n However, we also have to avoid the known absent letters: C, A, N. This word is okay.\n\n But wait: we have E at position 2? We don\'t have any information about E at position 2. It might be correct? Or it might be present but in the wrong position? We don\'t know.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""ROUSE"": \n   R, O, U, S, E -> \n   R at position 1? New.\n   E at position 5? We know E is not at position 5? So we avoid.\n\n How about ""ROBED"": \n   R, O, B, E, D -> \n   R at 1, E at 4? That\'s new for E (previously we had E at 5, now at 4). So that\'s good.\n\n So ""ROBED"" seems acceptable.\n\n But let me check: \n   R at 1: we haven\'t tried that.\n   O, B: new letters.\n   E at 4: we haven\'t tried that.\n\n So we can use ""ROBED"".\n\n However, we might get more information if we use a word that has more common consonants? Like S, T, L.\n\n Another candidate: ""TRIBE"" -> but we have A? No, T, R, I, B, E -> \n   R at position 2? Avoid.\n\n How about ""STIRE""? Not a word.\n\n How about ""SERIF"": \n   S, E, R, I, F -> \n   E at position 2? \n   R at position 3? That\'s new.\n\n This word: ""SERIF"" is valid.\n\n But we have E at position 2? We don\'t know if that\'s correct? And R at position 3? We know R is in the word but not at position 2, so position 3 is a candidate.\n\n Also, we are testing S, E, R, I, F.\n\n Alternatively, ""RICES"" -> but we know C is not in the word? So no.\n\n After considering, I think ""ROBED"" is a valid choice, but let me see if we can do better.\n\n How about ""PRIDE"": \n   P, R, I, D, E -> \n   R at position 2? Avoid.\n\n How about ""DRIVE"": \n   D, R, I, V, E -> \n   R at position 2? Avoid.\n\n How about ""GRIME"": \n   G, R, I, M, E -> \n   R at position 2? Avoid.\n\n How about ""OPTER""? Not common.\n\n Another idea: ""REMIT"": \n   R, E, M, I, T -> \n   R at position 1? New.\n   E at position 2? New.\n\n This is acceptable? But we have E at position 2? We don\'t know if that\'s correct? But we are testing.\n\n However, we are not repeating the same positions for R and E? R is at 1 (new) and E is at 2 (we haven\'t tried E at 2 before). \n\n Also, we are testing M, I, T.\n\n But note: we know the word has R and E, so we are covering that.\n\n Alternatively, ""REBUS"": \n   R, E, B, U, S -> \n   R at 1, E at 2? Same as above.\n\n But we are testing B, U, S.\n\n I think ""REBUS"" is a valid word (meaning a puzzle).\n\n However, we are using E at position 2? We don\'t have any information that E is not at position 2? So it\'s okay.\n\n But we might get more information if we use a word that has the R and E in positions that are more likely to be correct? Actually, we don\'t know.\n\n Another common word: ""ADIEU"" -> but we know A is not in the word? So no.\n\n After careful thought, I choose ""ROBED"". \n\n Why? \n - It has R at position 1 (which we haven\'t tried) and E at position 4 (which is new, since we only know E is not at 5).\n - It avoids the letters C, A, N.\n - It uses new common letters: O, B, D.\n\n So, second guess: ""ROBED""\n\n Let me write it: \n   R at 1, O at 2, B at 3, E at 4, D at 5.\n\n We hope to get feedback on these.\n\n If the feedback shows:\n   If R at 1 is correct, we get a check.\n   If E at 4 is correct, we get a check.\n\n And we\'ll know about O, B, D.\n\n So, I\'ll go with ""ROBED"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, A, and N are not in the word (marked ""x"").\n- R is in the word but not in position 2 (marked ""-"").\n- E is in the word but not in position 5 (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include R and E (since they are in the secret word), but avoid placing R in position 2 or E in position 5.\n- Must exclude C, A, and N (since they are absent).\n- Aim to test new common letters (e.g., B, O, D) and new positions for R and E.\n\nThe word ""ROBED"" fits these criteria:\n- Places R in position 1 (new position, not tested before).\n- Places E in position 4 (new position, avoiding position 5).\n- Uses new letters: O, B, D (all untested).\n- Excludes C, A, N.\n\nThis guess will help identify the positions of R and E while testing three new letters.\n\n<guess>robed</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: robed -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) O(x) B(✓) E(✓) D(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Meaning:
- C, A, N are not in the word.
- R is in the word but not at position 2.
- E is in the word but not at position 5.

Guess 2: ""robed"" -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) O(x) B(✓) E(✓) D(x)
Meaning:
- R is correct at position 1 (so the secret word starts with R).
- O is not in the word.
- B is correct at position 3 (so the third letter is B).
- E is correct at position 4 (so the fourth letter is E).
- D is not in the word.

Now, combining the information:
- The secret word starts with R, has B at position 3, and E at position 4. So the pattern so far is: R _ B E _
- Known absent letters: C, A, N, O, D (from the feedback above).
- Known present letters: R, B, E (with their exact positions known: R at 1, B at 3, E at 4).
- From the first guess, we also know that R is in the word (but now we know it's at position 1) and E is in the word (now at position 4).

Additionally, we know from the first guess that the secret word does not contain C, A, N, and from the second guess, it does not contain O and D.

Now, the missing letter is position 2 and position 5.

We need to find a 5-letter word that fits: R _ B E _

And the missing letters (position 2 and 5) must be letters that have not been ruled out. These letters cannot be C, A, N, O, D, and must be letters that we haven't tried or that are still possible.

Also, note that in the first guess, we had R and E in the word, but in different positions. Now we know their exact positions.

The word has the pattern: R _ B E _

We need to fill in the two blanks with letters that are not excluded (not C, A, N, O, D). We also have to consider that the entire word must be valid.

Possible letters for position 2 and 5: any letter except C, A, N, O, D. But we also haven't checked many letters yet.

Common remaining letters: F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we should choose a word that uses some of these and is valid.

The word must be: R?B?E? with the third letter B and fourth E. So the pattern is R (letter1) B E (letter2).

Possible words? Let's brainstorm:

- R I B E S? But that's 5 letters? ""RIBES"" is a word? Actually, it is a genus of plants. But let's see: positions: R at 1, I at 2, B at 3, E at 4, S at 5. So ""RIBES"".

But we don't know if I and S are allowed? We haven't ruled out I or S.

Other possibilities:
- R U B E S? ""RUBES"" is not common? It's plural of rube? But valid.
- R O B E S? But O is ruled out? We know O is absent. So not possible.
- R A B E S? But A is absent? No.
- R H Y M E? But that has Y and M? And H? But pattern: R at 1, H at 2? But then at 3 would be Y? But we need B at 3? Wait, no: we know position 3 is B. So the word must have B at position 3.

So fixed pattern: R ? B E ?

So four-letter pattern: R, ?, B, E, ?

Possible words? Let me list:

- ""RUBLE"": but L and E? Pattern: R, U, B, L, E? But position 4 is E? Wait, ""RUBLE"": R U B L E -> position 4 is L, but we need position 4 to be E? No, our pattern requires position 4 to be E. So ""RUBLE"" has E at 5? Not matching.

We must have E at position 4. So last letter is not E? Unless duplicated? But we don't know about duplicates.

Possible: 
- ""RIBES"" as I said: R I B E S -> matches pattern? 
  Position1: R
  Position2: I
  Position3: B
  Position4: E
  Position5: S

Yes, ""RIBES"" is a valid word.

- ""RUBES"": R U B E S -> 
  Position1: R
  Position2: U
  Position3: B
  Position4: E
  Position5: S

Also valid.

- ""RABES"" but R A B E S? A is absent? Not allowed.

- ""ROBES"": O absent? Not allowed.

- ""RUBEL""? R U B E L -> position 4 is E? But then L at 5? But that's 5 letters. ""RUBEL"" is a currency? But valid? Actually, it's R U B E L.

But in our pattern, we have R ? B E L? That would be R at1, ? at2, B at3, E at4, L at5. So ""RUBEL"" is R U B E L -> positions: 1:R, 2:U, 3:B, 4:E, 5:L.

So ""RUBEL"" is a possibility? But we don't know if U and L are allowed.

But we have two classes: RIBES, RUBES, RUBEL, etc.

But we also have ""RIPES"": R I P E S? But P is not at position 3? We need position 3 to be B! So not possible.

Similarly, ""RIFLE"": R I F L E -> position 3 is F? Not B.

With B at 3 and E at 4: 
- Other words: ""ROBED"" we already tried? But we know D is absent? Not the same.

Not many words have the pattern R?BES?

Actually, common words? ""RABID"" but A and D absent? And not matching pattern (position4 would be I?).

Another word: ""REBUS"" but that's R E B U S? Position1: R, position2: E? But we have E at position4? And if position2 is E? But we know the secret word has E at position4? That doesn't forbid E at other positions? However, in ""REBUS"", position2 is E? Also, position3 is B? So R E B U S? This might be a word? But in the pattern, our position2 is not fixed? Only that we know that E is at position4, but possibly it can be elsewhere?

But we know E is at position4? Does that mean it might be only at position4? Or could be duplicated? We don't know yet.

In the first guess, we had E at position5? And that was marked as present but wrong? And now in the second guess, E at position4 is marked correct? So E is at position4? It may or may not appear elsewhere.

Similarly, R? We have R at position1, but it could be elsewhere? However, in the first guess, we had R at position2? And that was marked as present? But now that R is fixed at position1, it could be that R is only at position1? Or duplicated? But no other information.

So, for the pattern: R at1, then a letter, then B at3, then E at4, then a letter.

Possibilities: 
- The last letter is the only one missing? And we need to choose one that is not excluded.

Common words: 
- ""RIBES"" (valid): letters I and S. 
- ""RUBES"" (valid): U and S.
- ""RUBEL"": U and L.
- ""JUMPS"" not matching.

Also, ""CABIN"" but C absent and not matching.

Other possibility: ""RBC"" wait no.

We need to test.

But note: we have only one missing position? Actually, two missing positions: position2 and position5.

We know the secret word is of the form: R ? B E ?

We need to fill the two blanks with letters that are not C, A, N, O, D.

Let's think: 
The set of allowed letters includes: F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we can try to guess a word that fills both blanks and is valid.

For example, ""RIPEN"" but N absent? No.

How about ""RIDES""? But we need B at position3? Position3 would be D? But we have B fixed at position3? So no.

Another idea: ""WRITE"" not matching.

Or ""LIVER"" not matching.

So limited options: 

- ""RIBES"" : I (position2), S (position5)
- ""RUBES"" : U (position2), S (position5)
- ""RUBEL"" : U (position2), L (position5)
- ""RABAT"" but not matching and A absent.
- ""ROBES"" but O absent.
- ""RUMBA"" but U, M, A? A absent? And position3 is B? Position4 is A? But we need E at position4? So not matching.
- ""CUBES"" but C absent.
- ""TUBES"" T at1? But we need R at1.

Only a few words match the pattern.

We can try ""RIBES"", but we are not sure.

However, we have more information: from the first guess, we had R and E. And now we have exact positions. But we need to confirm the missing letters.

But we are allowed to guess one of these.

Also, note: in the first guess, ""crane"" we had E at position5? And that was wrong? So the secret word does not have E at position5? So if we guess a word with E at position5? But that would be inconsistent? Actually, ""RIBES"" has S at position5? Not E? So that's okay.

Similarly, ""RUBES"" has S at position5? ""RUBEL"" has L at position5.

We don't have positive information about S or L? So they could be present?

We need to choose a word that tests common letters? Or we can use one of these.

Since we have three letters fixed: R, B, E? And we only have two positions unknown? We might guess correctly now.

But we have multiple options? ""RIBES"", ""RUBES"", ""RUBEL"", maybe ""RUBLE"" (variant of ROUBLE)?

""RUBLE"" is also a valid word: same as RUBEL? R U B L E.

We can choose one to test.

But note: we only have two positions: position2 and position5. So if we guess incorrectly, we get information? But we have limited tries.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses letters we haven't tried yet? To cover more possibilities.

For example, we might guess ""RISES""? But position3 is S? We need B? So no.

We cannot change positions1,3,4? Because they are fixed: R, B, E.

So any guess must have R at1, B at3, E at4? So the pattern is fixed: R ? B E ?

Therefore, we must guess with that pattern.

So we should choose a word that matches this pattern and uses letters that have not been excluded? And we haven't tried many letters? We only know C, A, N, O, D are absent? And we know R, B, E exact? So we need to fill the two blanks.

Possible words:

- ""RIBES"" : I in position2, S in position5
- ""RUBES"" : U in position2, S in position5
- ""RUBEL"" : U in position2, L in position5
- ""RUBLE"" : U in position2, E in position5? But E at position5? But we know from the first guess that E is not at position5? Because in ""crane"", position5 was E, marked as wrong position? Not necessarily that E cannot be at position5? Actually, the feedback was ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not at position5? So E cannot be at position5? Because if it were, it would be marked correct? But since it was marked as present but wrong position? So E is in the word, but at a position different from position5? And now we know it's at position4? So E cannot be duplicated at position5? Therefore, the secret word has E only at position4? So position5 cannot be E? Therefore, the word ""RUBLE"" would have E at position4 and E at position5? But because E is already placed at position4, if there is no duplicate, then position5 cannot be E? But we don't know for sure.

Let me clarify: the first guess ""crane"" had E at position5? And that E was marked as present but not at that position? So the secret word has at least one E and it is not at position5? The second guess ""robed"" had E at position4? It was marked correct? So now the secret word has E at position4? But if it has only one E, then position5 cannot be E? But if it has two E's, then position5 could be E? However, if there were two E's, then in the first guess, we would have seen only one E marked? But the feedback would be: when guessing a letter that appears twice? Actually, in Wordle, if you guess the same letter twice? Then if one instance is correct or present? It may show accordingly? But in this case, we did not guess two E's? So we don't know.

To be safe, we should avoid assuming duplicates? But it's possible.

But the pattern R?BES: R ? B E S? So ending with S is common? Like ""ribes"", ""rubes"", ""ruble"" ends with E? Which we think might not be possible? Because E at position5 is not allowed? But ""ruble"" has E at position5? Is that allowed? Wait, no: because we know from first guess that E is not at position5? So if we have a word with E at position5? Then if E is also at position4? Then it would be duplicated E? And that's possible? But the first guess ""crane"" had E at position5? And that was marked as present but wrong? So there is at least one E? And it's not at position5? If the secret word has E at position5? Then it would be a duplicate E? But the first guess would have shown E at position5 as present? Because the secret word has E at position5? So it should be marked as present? But the feedback was: for E at position5, it was marked as present but wrong? Wait, no: the rule: if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, mark as ""-"". But if the secret word has E at position5, then if we guess E at position5, it should be marked as ""✓"" (correct)? But in the first guess, it was ""-"", so it is not correct? Therefore, the secret word does not have E at position5? So if we have a word with E at position5? Then that E would be marked as ""x"" maybe? Or ""-""? Actually, if the secret word has E at position4, and we guess E at position5? Then it would show ""-"" for position5? But we know the secret word has E? So if we guess E at a position where it isn't? But it is in the word elsewhere? Then it shows ""-""? However, we already have E at position4? So if we guess E at position5? And the secret word does not have E at position5? Then it would be redundant? But the feedback would depend on whether there is another E? But we don't know if there is a second E.

But to avoid confusion, we should choose a word that does not use E at position5? Because we know the secret word has E at position4? And we don't want to duplicate? But if there is only one E, then we cannot have E at position5? So words like ""RUBLE"" (with E at5) would be invalid if there is only one E? But we don't know? So safer to avoid E at position5? Also, letters that are absent.

Therefore, possible words without E at the end? So ending with a non-E:

- ""RIBES"" : ends with S
- ""RUBES"" : ends with S
- ""RUBEL"" : ends with L? And does not have E? Wait, ""RUBEL"": R U B E L -> position5 is L? It does not have E at position5? Position5 is L? So it's okay.

Similarly, ""RUBLE"": same as RUBEL? R U B L E? Wait: that would be R at1, U at2, B at3, L at4? Then E at5? Oh no: position4 is L? But we need position4 to be E! So for ""RUBLE"", the spelling is usually R-U-B-L-E? So positions: 1:R, 2:U, 3:B, 4:L, 5:E? But we require position4 to be E? So actually, ""RUBLE"" does not match? Because position4 is L? Not E? So we cannot have ""RUBLE"" because it doesn't have E at position4?

We need position4 to be E? So words like ""RUBLE"" have E at position5? And position4 is L? So they don't fit our pattern of having E at position4.

Therefore, the only possibilities that have E at position4 are words ending with a different letter? Like:

- R I B E S : position4 is E? Yes, position4: E? Position5: S? So ""RIBES"".
- R U B E S : ""RUBES"".
- R U B E L : ""RUBEL""? But RUBEL is R U B E L? Then positions: 1:R, 2:U, 3:B, 4:E, 5:L? Yes, it has E at position4? So matches pattern.

Also? ""RABES"" but A absent? No.
""ROBES"" O absent.

So three words? ""RIBES"", ""RUBES"", ""RUBEL"".

We can choose one? But we don't know which one? And we have 5 tries left? Actually we have used 2, so 4 left? No, we have 6 tries? We used 2, so 4 remaining? But perhaps we can guess one? Or use a word that tests as much as possible.

But we have to guess a word that matches the pattern? So we have to pick one? 

We can try with a word that has letters we haven't tested? I and S? Or U and S? Or U and L? That hasn't been tested? 

Looking at the first guess, we tested C, R, A, N, E? And second guess: R, O, B, E, D? So we haven't tested S, I, U, L?

We can guess ""RIBES"" to test I and S? If it is not correct, we get feedback on I and S? Then we can narrow down? Similarly, ""RUBES"" tests U and S? Etc.

Among the options, ""RIBES"" contains I and S? Which are vowels and common? ""RUBES"" contains U and S? U is less common? So ""RIBES"" might be more typical? Or we could choose one.

But to make it arbitrary? I'll choose ""RIBES"".

Alternatively, to cover more ground? But note: the word must match the pattern? So if we guess ""RIBES"", and it is not correct? We might get:

- Position2: I? Marked as wrong? Or not present?
- Position5: S? Marked accordingly.

Then we can deduce.

Similarly for other guesses.

Therefore, I suggest guessing ""RIBES"".

After submitting ""RIBES"", we will receive feedback? And continue.

So next guess: ""RIBES""

Therefore, return <guess>ribes</guess>.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the two previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)**  
  - This indicates that the secret word does not contain C, A, or N.
  - R is present but not in position 2.
  - E is present but not in position 5.

- **Guess 2: robed → Feedback: R(✓) O(x) B(✓) E(✓) D(x)**  
  - R is correct and in position 1 (so the word starts with R).
  - O is not in the word.
  - B is correct and in position 3 (so the third letter is B).
  - E is correct and in position 4 (so the fourth letter is E).
  - D is not in the word.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word pattern is **R _ B E _** (position 1: R, position 3: B, position 4: E).
- Positions 2 and 5 are unknown.
- Absent letters: **C, A, N, O, D** (cannot appear anywhere).
- Present letters with known positions: **R (pos1), B (pos3), E (pos4)**.
- From Guess 1, E is confirmed present (now at pos4) but not at pos5, so position 5 cannot be E.

### Optimization for Next Guess:
- The goal is to solve the word efficiently by testing plausible candidates for positions 2 and 5 while avoiding excluded letters.
- Only a few valid English words fit the pattern **R _ B E _**:
  - **RIBES** (meaning a genus of plants): Positions: R (1), I (2), B (3), E (4), S (5).
  - **RUBES** (plural of ""rube""): Positions: R (1), U (2), B (3), E (4), S (5).
  - **RUBEL** (variant spelling of ""rouble,"" a currency): Positions: R (1), U (2), B (3), E (4), L (5).
- Other combinations? Words like ""RABES"" or ""ROBES"" are invalid due to excluded A and O.
- **RIBES** is chosen here to test:
  - **I** (vowel, common) in position 2.
  - **S** (common consonant) in position 5.
- If incorrect, feedback on **I** and **S** will help confirm/eliminate **U** or **L** in future guesses.

<guess>ribes</guess>",ribes,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Meaning:
- C, A, N are not in the word.
- R is in the word but not at position 2.
- E is in the word but not at position 5.

Guess 2: ""robed"" -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) O(x) B(✓) E(✓) D(x)
Meaning:
- R is correct at position 1 (so the secret word starts with R).
- O is not in the word.
- B is correct at position 3 (so the third letter is B).
- E is correct at position 4 (so the fourth letter is E).
- D is not in the word.

Now, combining the information:
- The secret word starts with R, has B at position 3, and E at position 4. So the pattern so far is: R _ B E _
- Known absent letters: C, A, N, O, D (from the feedback above).
- Known present letters: R, B, E (with their exact positions known: R at 1, B at 3, E at 4).
- From the first guess, we also know that R is in the word (but now we know it's at position 1) and E is in the word (now at position 4).

Additionally, we know from the first guess that the secret word does not contain C, A, N, and from the second guess, it does not contain O and D.

Now, the missing letter is position 2 and position 5.

We need to find a 5-letter word that fits: R _ B E _

And the missing letters (position 2 and 5) must be letters that have not been ruled out. These letters cannot be C, A, N, O, D, and must be letters that we haven't tried or that are still possible.

Also, note that in the first guess, we had R and E in the word, but in different positions. Now we know their exact positions.

The word has the pattern: R _ B E _

We need to fill in the two blanks with letters that are not excluded (not C, A, N, O, D). We also have to consider that the entire word must be valid.

Possible letters for position 2 and 5: any letter except C, A, N, O, D. But we also haven't checked many letters yet.

Common remaining letters: F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we should choose a word that uses some of these and is valid.

The word must be: R?B?E? with the third letter B and fourth E. So the pattern is R (letter1) B E (letter2).

Possible words? Let's brainstorm:

- R I B E S? But that's 5 letters? ""RIBES"" is a word? Actually, it is a genus of plants. But let's see: positions: R at 1, I at 2, B at 3, E at 4, S at 5. So ""RIBES"".

But we don't know if I and S are allowed? We haven't ruled out I or S.

Other possibilities:
- R U B E S? ""RUBES"" is not common? It's plural of rube? But valid.
- R O B E S? But O is ruled out? We know O is absent. So not possible.
- R A B E S? But A is absent? No.
- R H Y M E? But that has Y and M? And H? But pattern: R at 1, H at 2? But then at 3 would be Y? But we need B at 3? Wait, no: we know position 3 is B. So the word must have B at position 3.

So fixed pattern: R ? B E ?

So four-letter pattern: R, ?, B, E, ?

Possible words? Let me list:

- ""RUBLE"": but L and E? Pattern: R, U, B, L, E? But position 4 is E? Wait, ""RUBLE"": R U B L E -> position 4 is L, but we need position 4 to be E? No, our pattern requires position 4 to be E. So ""RUBLE"" has E at 5? Not matching.

We must have E at position 4. So last letter is not E? Unless duplicated? But we don't know about duplicates.

Possible: 
- ""RIBES"" as I said: R I B E S -> matches pattern? 
  Position1: R
  Position2: I
  Position3: B
  Position4: E
  Position5: S

Yes, ""RIBES"" is a valid word.

- ""RUBES"": R U B E S -> 
  Position1: R
  Position2: U
  Position3: B
  Position4: E
  Position5: S

Also valid.

- ""RABES"" but R A B E S? A is absent? Not allowed.

- ""ROBES"": O absent? Not allowed.

- ""RUBEL""? R U B E L -> position 4 is E? But then L at 5? But that's 5 letters. ""RUBEL"" is a currency? But valid? Actually, it's R U B E L.

But in our pattern, we have R ? B E L? That would be R at1, ? at2, B at3, E at4, L at5. So ""RUBEL"" is R U B E L -> positions: 1:R, 2:U, 3:B, 4:E, 5:L.

So ""RUBEL"" is a possibility? But we don't know if U and L are allowed.

But we have two classes: RIBES, RUBES, RUBEL, etc.

But we also have ""RIPES"": R I P E S? But P is not at position 3? We need position 3 to be B! So not possible.

Similarly, ""RIFLE"": R I F L E -> position 3 is F? Not B.

With B at 3 and E at 4: 
- Other words: ""ROBED"" we already tried? But we know D is absent? Not the same.

Not many words have the pattern R?BES?

Actually, common words? ""RABID"" but A and D absent? And not matching pattern (position4 would be I?).

Another word: ""REBUS"" but that's R E B U S? Position1: R, position2: E? But we have E at position4? And if position2 is E? But we know the secret word has E at position4? That doesn't forbid E at other positions? However, in ""REBUS"", position2 is E? Also, position3 is B? So R E B U S? This might be a word? But in the pattern, our position2 is not fixed? Only that we know that E is at position4, but possibly it can be elsewhere?

But we know E is at position4? Does that mean it might be only at position4? Or could be duplicated? We don't know yet.

In the first guess, we had E at position5? And that was marked as present but wrong? And now in the second guess, E at position4 is marked correct? So E is at position4? It may or may not appear elsewhere.

Similarly, R? We have R at position1, but it could be elsewhere? However, in the first guess, we had R at position2? And that was marked as present? But now that R is fixed at position1, it could be that R is only at position1? Or duplicated? But no other information.

So, for the pattern: R at1, then a letter, then B at3, then E at4, then a letter.

Possibilities: 
- The last letter is the only one missing? And we need to choose one that is not excluded.

Common words: 
- ""RIBES"" (valid): letters I and S. 
- ""RUBES"" (valid): U and S.
- ""RUBEL"": U and L.
- ""JUMPS"" not matching.

Also, ""CABIN"" but C absent and not matching.

Other possibility: ""RBC"" wait no.

We need to test.

But note: we have only one missing position? Actually, two missing positions: position2 and position5.

We know the secret word is of the form: R ? B E ?

We need to fill the two blanks with letters that are not C, A, N, O, D.

Let's think: 
The set of allowed letters includes: F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we can try to guess a word that fills both blanks and is valid.

For example, ""RIPEN"" but N absent? No.

How about ""RIDES""? But we need B at position3? Position3 would be D? But we have B fixed at position3? So no.

Another idea: ""WRITE"" not matching.

Or ""LIVER"" not matching.

So limited options: 

- ""RIBES"" : I (position2), S (position5)
- ""RUBES"" : U (position2), S (position5)
- ""RUBEL"" : U (position2), L (position5)
- ""RABAT"" but not matching and A absent.
- ""ROBES"" but O absent.
- ""RUMBA"" but U, M, A? A absent? And position3 is B? Position4 is A? But we need E at position4? So not matching.
- ""CUBES"" but C absent.
- ""TUBES"" T at1? But we need R at1.

Only a few words match the pattern.

We can try ""RIBES"", but we are not sure.

However, we have more information: from the first guess, we had R and E. And now we have exact positions. But we need to confirm the missing letters.

But we are allowed to guess one of these.

Also, note: in the first guess, ""crane"" we had E at position5? And that was wrong? So the secret word does not have E at position5? So if we guess a word with E at position5? But that would be inconsistent? Actually, ""RIBES"" has S at position5? Not E? So that's okay.

Similarly, ""RUBES"" has S at position5? ""RUBEL"" has L at position5.

We don't have positive information about S or L? So they could be present?

We need to choose a word that tests common letters? Or we can use one of these.

Since we have three letters fixed: R, B, E? And we only have two positions unknown? We might guess correctly now.

But we have multiple options? ""RIBES"", ""RUBES"", ""RUBEL"", maybe ""RUBLE"" (variant of ROUBLE)?

""RUBLE"" is also a valid word: same as RUBEL? R U B L E.

We can choose one to test.

But note: we only have two positions: position2 and position5. So if we guess incorrectly, we get information? But we have limited tries.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses letters we haven't tried yet? To cover more possibilities.

For example, we might guess ""RISES""? But position3 is S? We need B? So no.

We cannot change positions1,3,4? Because they are fixed: R, B, E.

So any guess must have R at1, B at3, E at4? So the pattern is fixed: R ? B E ?

Therefore, we must guess with that pattern.

So we should choose a word that matches this pattern and uses letters that have not been excluded? And we haven't tried many letters? We only know C, A, N, O, D are absent? And we know R, B, E exact? So we need to fill the two blanks.

Possible words:

- ""RIBES"" : I in position2, S in position5
- ""RUBES"" : U in position2, S in position5
- ""RUBEL"" : U in position2, L in position5
- ""RUBLE"" : U in position2, E in position5? But E at position5? But we know from the first guess that E is not at position5? Because in ""crane"", position5 was E, marked as wrong position? Not necessarily that E cannot be at position5? Actually, the feedback was ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not at position5? So E cannot be at position5? Because if it were, it would be marked correct? But since it was marked as present but wrong position? So E is in the word, but at a position different from position5? And now we know it's at position4? So E cannot be duplicated at position5? Therefore, the secret word has E only at position4? So position5 cannot be E? Therefore, the word ""RUBLE"" would have E at position4 and E at position5? But because E is already placed at position4, if there is no duplicate, then position5 cannot be E? But we don't know for sure.

Let me clarify: the first guess ""crane"" had E at position5? And that E was marked as present but not at that position? So the secret word has at least one E and it is not at position5? The second guess ""robed"" had E at position4? It was marked correct? So now the secret word has E at position4? But if it has only one E, then position5 cannot be E? But if it has two E's, then position5 could be E? However, if there were two E's, then in the first guess, we would have seen only one E marked? But the feedback would be: when guessing a letter that appears twice? Actually, in Wordle, if you guess the same letter twice? Then if one instance is correct or present? It may show accordingly? But in this case, we did not guess two E's? So we don't know.

To be safe, we should avoid assuming duplicates? But it's possible.

But the pattern R?BES: R ? B E S? So ending with S is common? Like ""ribes"", ""rubes"", ""ruble"" ends with E? Which we think might not be possible? Because E at position5 is not allowed? But ""ruble"" has E at position5? Is that allowed? Wait, no: because we know from first guess that E is not at position5? So if we have a word with E at position5? Then if E is also at position4? Then it would be duplicated E? And that's possible? But the first guess ""crane"" had E at position5? And that was marked as present but wrong? So there is at least one E? And it's not at position5? If the secret word has E at position5? Then it would be a duplicate E? But the first guess would have shown E at position5 as present? Because the secret word has E at position5? So it should be marked as present? But the feedback was: for E at position5, it was marked as present but wrong? Wait, no: the rule: if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, mark as ""-"". But if the secret word has E at position5, then if we guess E at position5, it should be marked as ""✓"" (correct)? But in the first guess, it was ""-"", so it is not correct? Therefore, the secret word does not have E at position5? So if we have a word with E at position5? Then that E would be marked as ""x"" maybe? Or ""-""? Actually, if the secret word has E at position4, and we guess E at position5? Then it would show ""-"" for position5? But we know the secret word has E? So if we guess E at a position where it isn't? But it is in the word elsewhere? Then it shows ""-""? However, we already have E at position4? So if we guess E at position5? And the secret word does not have E at position5? Then it would be redundant? But the feedback would depend on whether there is another E? But we don't know if there is a second E.

But to avoid confusion, we should choose a word that does not use E at position5? Because we know the secret word has E at position4? And we don't want to duplicate? But if there is only one E, then we cannot have E at position5? So words like ""RUBLE"" (with E at5) would be invalid if there is only one E? But we don't know? So safer to avoid E at position5? Also, letters that are absent.

Therefore, possible words without E at the end? So ending with a non-E:

- ""RIBES"" : ends with S
- ""RUBES"" : ends with S
- ""RUBEL"" : ends with L? And does not have E? Wait, ""RUBEL"": R U B E L -> position5 is L? It does not have E at position5? Position5 is L? So it's okay.

Similarly, ""RUBLE"": same as RUBEL? R U B L E? Wait: that would be R at1, U at2, B at3, L at4? Then E at5? Oh no: position4 is L? But we need position4 to be E! So for ""RUBLE"", the spelling is usually R-U-B-L-E? So positions: 1:R, 2:U, 3:B, 4:L, 5:E? But we require position4 to be E? So actually, ""RUBLE"" does not match? Because position4 is L? Not E? So we cannot have ""RUBLE"" because it doesn't have E at position4?

We need position4 to be E? So words like ""RUBLE"" have E at position5? And position4 is L? So they don't fit our pattern of having E at position4.

Therefore, the only possibilities that have E at position4 are words ending with a different letter? Like:

- R I B E S : position4 is E? Yes, position4: E? Position5: S? So ""RIBES"".
- R U B E S : ""RUBES"".
- R U B E L : ""RUBEL""? But RUBEL is R U B E L? Then positions: 1:R, 2:U, 3:B, 4:E, 5:L? Yes, it has E at position4? So matches pattern.

Also? ""RABES"" but A absent? No.
""ROBES"" O absent.

So three words? ""RIBES"", ""RUBES"", ""RUBEL"".

We can choose one? But we don't know which one? And we have 5 tries left? Actually we have used 2, so 4 left? No, we have 6 tries? We used 2, so 4 remaining? But perhaps we can guess one? Or use a word that tests as much as possible.

But we have to guess a word that matches the pattern? So we have to pick one? 

We can try with a word that has letters we haven't tested? I and S? Or U and S? Or U and L? That hasn't been tested? 

Looking at the first guess, we tested C, R, A, N, E? And second guess: R, O, B, E, D? So we haven't tested S, I, U, L?

We can guess ""RIBES"" to test I and S? If it is not correct, we get feedback on I and S? Then we can narrow down? Similarly, ""RUBES"" tests U and S? Etc.

Among the options, ""RIBES"" contains I and S? Which are vowels and common? ""RUBES"" contains U and S? U is less common? So ""RIBES"" might be more typical? Or we could choose one.

But to make it arbitrary? I'll choose ""RIBES"".

Alternatively, to cover more ground? But note: the word must match the pattern? So if we guess ""RIBES"", and it is not correct? We might get:

- Position2: I? Marked as wrong? Or not present?
- Position5: S? Marked accordingly.

Then we can deduce.

Similarly for other guesses.

Therefore, I suggest guessing ""RIBES"".

After submitting ""RIBES"", we will receive feedback? And continue.

So next guess: ""RIBES""

Therefore, return <guess>ribes</guess>.Based on the feedback from the two previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)**  
  - This indicates that the secret word does not contain C, A, or N.
  - R is present but not in position 2.
  - E is present but not in position 5.

- **Guess 2: robed → Feedback: R(✓) O(x) B(✓) E(✓) D(x)**  
  - R is correct and in position 1 (so the word starts with R).
  - O is not in the word.
  - B is correct and in position 3 (so the third letter is B).
  - E is correct and in position 4 (so the fourth letter is E).

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R is not the second letter, and E is not the fifth letter.
 - The letters C, A, N are not in the word at all.

 Since we have 6 tries, we can use this information to make a second guess.

 We need to choose a word that:
 1. Includes R and E (since they are in the secret word) but in different positions than in ""crane"".
    - R was in position 2, so in the new guess, R should not be in position 2? Actually, it can be in any position except that we know it's not the second? 
      But note: the feedback says R is in the word but not in position 2. So R must be in one of positions 1,3,4,5? Actually, no: the feedback only tells us about the position we guessed. 
      It doesn't prevent R from being in position 2? Wait, no: because if R were in position 2, it would have been marked as correct (✓). But it was marked as present but wrong position (-), so R is in the word but not at position 2.

 2. Does not include C, A, N.

 Also, we want to include other common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, H, etc.

 We know the word has 5 letters. We have two known letters: R and E.

 We can try to put R and E in positions that are not the ones we already tried (so R not at position 2, and E not at position 5).

 Also, we have three positions that were wrong: positions 1,3,4 (because we had C, A, N there and they are absent). But note: the feedback doesn't tell us about the positions of the absent letters, only that they are absent.

 So, for the next guess, we can try:

 Let me try to think of a word that has R and E, and three new letters.

 Example: ""ROUTE"" -> but we have O, U, T. However, note that we don't know if O, U, T are in the word. Also, we must avoid A and N? Actually, we know A and N are not in the word, so we can use other letters.

 But wait: we also know that the word does not have C, A, N. So we can use any letters except C, A, N.

 However, we must be cautious: we don't want to reuse letters that we know are absent? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we know they are not in the word. So we avoid C, A, N.

 Let me try to form a word:

 We have to place R and E. Since R was not at position 2, we can try R at position 1? But note: we don't know if position 1 is R or not. Similarly, E was not at position 5, so we can try E at position 1? But that might be unusual.

 Alternatively, we can try to put R at position 3 or 4 or 5? But note: in the first guess, position 5 was E and it was present but wrong, so E is not at position 5. But we don't know about position 1,3,4 for R.

 However, we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But the feedback doesn't indicate that, so we assume no duplicates for now.

 Let me think of words without C, A, N, and with R and E.

 Some possibilities: 
 - ""TRIED"": T, R, I, E, D -> but R is at position 2? We know R is not at position 2? Actually, we know from the first guess that R is not at position 2. But in this new word, if we put R at position 2, then we are repeating the same mistake? We know R is not at position 2, so we should avoid putting R at position 2.

 So in ""TRIED"", R is at position 2 -> that's the same position we already tried and it was wrong. So we should avoid that.

 How about ""RIDER""? But that has two R's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but typically in Wordle, duplicates are possible. However, the feedback for the first guess didn't show two R's? Actually, we only had one R. So if the word has two R's, then when we guessed ""crane"" (which has one R) we would have only gotten one R marked? But the feedback only marks the letters that are present. So if the word has two R's and we guess one, we get one R marked. So duplicates are possible.

 But to keep it simple, let's avoid duplicates for now.

 Another word: ""STREP"" -> but we have S, T, R, E, P. And R is at position 3? That's a new position. E is at position 4? Also, we avoid position 2 for R and position 5 for E? Actually, in ""STREP"":
   position 1: S
   position 2: T
   position 3: R -> that's okay because we haven't tried R at position 3? And we know R is not at position 2, but position 3 is new.
   position 4: E -> and we know E is not at position 5, but position 4 is new.
   position 5: P

 But note: we also have to check if S, T, P are in the word? We don't know. This guess will help us.

 However, we must make sure the word is valid. ""STREP"" is a valid word (meaning a type of bacteria).

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROGUE"": 
   R at position 1 (which is new for R) and E at position 5? But wait, we know E is not at position 5? Because in the first guess, we had E at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong. So if we put E at position 5 again, we know it's wrong? But we can do that to test? Actually, we can, but it might be inefficient.

 However, the feedback for E at position 5 was that it is present but not at that position. So if we put E at position 5 again, we will get the same feedback? That is, we won't get a check for E at position 5 because we know it's not there. So it's better to try E in a new position.

 Therefore, we should avoid putting E at position 5. Similarly, avoid R at position 2.

 So ""ROGUE"" has E at position 5 -> not good.

 How about ""DRIVE"": 
   D at 1, R at 2 -> but R at position 2 is the same as before? We know R is not at position 2, so we avoid that.

 How about ""PRICE"": but we know C is not in the word? So we cannot use C.

 How about ""TRIPE"": 
   T, R, I, P, E
   R at position 2 -> again, we know R is not at position 2? So we avoid.

 We need a word that has R not at position 2 and E not at position 5.

 Let me try: ""PERKY"" -> P, E, R, K, Y
   E at position 2? We don't know about position 2 for E? But we know E is in the word, but not at position 5. We don't know about other positions.
   R at position 3? That's new.

 But note: we also have to avoid A, C, N. This word doesn't have them.

 However, we have Y and K? They are less common, but okay.

 Alternatively, ""ROBES"": 
   R at 1, O, B, E at 4, S at 5 -> E is at position 4? That's new. And R at position 1? That's new.

 But we don't know if O, B, S are in the word.

 Another common word: ""STORE"": 
   S, T, O, R, E -> but R is at position 4? and E at position 5? We know E is not at position 5? So we avoid E at position 5.

 How about ""STOLE"": 
   S, T, O, L, E -> but we don't have R? We must include R because we know it's in the word.

 So we need a word that has R and E, and avoids C, A, N.

 Let me think: ""RIPER""? But that has two R's? And E at the end? We know E is not at position 5? So we avoid.

 How about ""RIPEN""? But we know N is not in the word? So we cannot use N.

 How about ""RIPED""? Not a common word? Actually, ""riped"" is not a standard word. We need valid words.

 Another idea: ""BREAD"" -> but we have A? We know A is not in the word? So we cannot use A.

 How about ""BREED""? But that has two E's? And we don't know if duplicates are there? Also, E at position 5? We know E is not at position 5? So avoid.

 How about ""BRUTE"": 
   B, R, U, T, E -> 
   R at position 2? We know R is not at position 2? So avoid.

 How about ""URGED"": 
   U, R, G, E, D -> 
   R at position 2? Again, same problem.

 How about ""TRIES"": 
   T, R, I, E, S -> 
   R at position 2? Avoid.

 How about ""RESIN"": but we know N is not in the word? So no.

 How about ""RESET"": 
   R, E, S, E, T -> has two E's? And we have E at position 2? We don't know if that's allowed? But also, we know E is in the word, but we don't know if there are two. 
   However, we also have E at position 5? We know E is not at position 5? So the second E at position 5 would be wrong? But we are trying to get information.

 But note: we are limited to 5 letters and we know the word has at least one R and one E. We don't know about duplicates.

 Alternatively, we can try ""RODEO""? But that has O and D? And no E? We need E.

 After some thought, I found: ""PRIED"": 
   P, R, I, E, D -> 
   R at position 2? Avoid.

 How about ""WROTE"": 
   W, R, O, T, E -> 
   R at position 2? Avoid.

 How about ""CRWTH""? Not common and we know C is not in the word.

 Another idea: ""EMPTY"" -> but no R? We must have R.

 How about ""RESTY"": 
   R, E, S, T, Y -> 
   R at position 1? That's new.
   E at position 2? We don't know about position 2 for E? It could be correct? 
   But note: we know R is in the word, but we don't know if it can be at position 1? We haven't tried position 1 for R.

 However, we also have to avoid the known absent letters: C, A, N. This word is okay.

 But wait: we have E at position 2? We don't have any information about E at position 2. It might be correct? Or it might be present but in the wrong position? We don't know.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROUSE"": 
   R, O, U, S, E -> 
   R at position 1? New.
   E at position 5? We know E is not at position 5? So we avoid.

 How about ""ROBED"": 
   R, O, B, E, D -> 
   R at 1, E at 4? That's new for E (previously we had E at 5, now at 4). So that's good.

 So ""ROBED"" seems acceptable.

 But let me check: 
   R at 1: we haven't tried that.
   O, B: new letters.
   E at 4: we haven't tried that.

 So we can use ""ROBED"".

 However, we might get more information if we use a word that has more common consonants? Like S, T, L.

 Another candidate: ""TRIBE"" -> but we have A? No, T, R, I, B, E -> 
   R at position 2? Avoid.

 How about ""STIRE""? Not a word.

 How about ""SERIF"": 
   S, E, R, I, F -> 
   E at position 2? 
   R at position 3? That's new.

 This word: ""SERIF"" is valid.

 But we have E at position 2? We don't know if that's correct? And R at position 3? We know R is in the word but not at position 2, so position 3 is a candidate.

 Also, we are testing S, E, R, I, F.

 Alternatively, ""RICES"" -> but we know C is not in the word? So no.

 After considering, I think ""ROBED"" is a valid choice, but let me see if we can do better.

 How about ""PRIDE"": 
   P, R, I, D, E -> 
   R at position 2? Avoid.

 How about ""DRIVE"": 
   D, R, I, V, E -> 
   R at position 2? Avoid.

 How about ""GRIME"": 
   G, R, I, M, E -> 
   R at position 2? Avoid.

 How about ""OPTER""? Not common.

 Another idea: ""REMIT"": 
   R, E, M, I, T -> 
   R at position 1? New.
   E at position 2? New.

 This is acceptable? But we have E at position 2? We don't know if that's correct? But we are testing.

 However, we are not repeating the same positions for R and E? R is at 1 (new) and E is at 2 (we haven't tried E at 2 before). 

 Also, we are testing M, I, T.

 But note: we know the word has R and E, so we are covering that.

 Alternatively, ""REBUS"": 
   R, E, B, U, S -> 
   R at 1, E at 2? Same as above.

 But we are testing B, U, S.

 I think ""REBUS"" is a valid word (meaning a puzzle).

 However, we are using E at position 2? We don't have any information that E is not at position 2? So it's okay.

 But we might get more information if we use a word that has the R and E in positions that are more likely to be correct? Actually, we don't know.

 Another common word: ""ADIEU"" -> but we know A is not in the word? So no.

 After careful thought, I choose ""ROBED"". 

 Why? 
 - It has R at position 1 (which we haven't tried) and E at position 4 (which is new, since we only know E is not at 5).
 - It avoids the letters C, A, N.
 - It uses new common letters: O, B, D.

 So, second guess: ""ROBED""

 Let me write it: 
   R at 1, O at 2, B at 3, E at 4, D at 5.

 We hope to get feedback on these.

 If the feedback shows:
   If R at 1 is correct, we get a check.
   If E at 4 is correct, we get a check.

 And we'll know about O, B, D.

 So, I'll go with ""ROBED"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and N are not in the word (marked ""x"").
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (marked ""-"").
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include R and E (since they are in the secret word), but avoid placing R in position 2 or E in position 5.
- Must exclude C, A, and N (since they are absent).
- Aim to test new common letters (e.g., B, O, D) and new positions for R and E.

The word ""ROBED"" fits these criteria:
- Places R in position 1 (new position, not tested before).
- Places E in position 4 (new position, avoiding position 5).
- Uses new letters: O, B, D (all untested).
- Excludes C, A, N.

This guess will help identify the positions of R and E while testing three new letters.

<guess>robed</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: robed -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) O(x) B(✓) E(✓) D(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Meaning:
- C, A, N are not in the word.
- R is in the word but not at position 2.
- E is in the word but not at position 5.

Guess 2: ""robed"" -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) O(x) B(✓) E(✓) D(x)
Meaning:
- R is correct at position 1 (so the secret word starts with R).
- O is not in the word.
- B is correct at position 3 (so the third letter is B).
- E is correct at position 4 (so the fourth letter is E).
- D is not in the word.

Now, combining the information:
- The secret word starts with R, has B at position 3, and E at position 4. So the pattern so far is: R _ B E _
- Known absent letters: C, A, N, O, D (from the feedback above).
- Known present letters: R, B, E (with their exact positions known: R at 1, B at 3, E at 4).
- From the first guess, we also know that R is in the word (but now we know it's at position 1) and E is in the word (now at position 4).

Additionally, we know from the first guess that the secret word does not contain C, A, N, and from the second guess, it does not contain O and D.

Now, the missing letter is position 2 and position 5.

We need to find a 5-letter word that fits: R _ B E _

And the missing letters (position 2 and 5) must be letters that have not been ruled out. These letters cannot be C, A, N, O, D, and must be letters that we haven't tried or that are still possible.

Also, note that in the first guess, we had R and E in the word, but in different positions. Now we know their exact positions.

The word has the pattern: R _ B E _

We need to fill in the two blanks with letters that are not excluded (not C, A, N, O, D). We also have to consider that the entire word must be valid.

Possible letters for position 2 and 5: any letter except C, A, N, O, D. But we also haven't checked many letters yet.

Common remaining letters: F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we should choose a word that uses some of these and is valid.

The word must be: R?B?E? with the third letter B and fourth E. So the pattern is R (letter1) B E (letter2).

Possible words? Let's brainstorm:

- R I B E S? But that's 5 letters? ""RIBES"" is a word? Actually, it is a genus of plants. But let's see: positions: R at 1, I at 2, B at 3, E at 4, S at 5. So ""RIBES"".

But we don't know if I and S are allowed? We haven't ruled out I or S.

Other possibilities:
- R U B E S? ""RUBES"" is not common? It's plural of rube? But valid.
- R O B E S? But O is ruled out? We know O is absent. So not possible.
- R A B E S? But A is absent? No.
- R H Y M E? But that has Y and M? And H? But pattern: R at 1, H at 2? But then at 3 would be Y? But we need B at 3? Wait, no: we know position 3 is B. So the word must have B at position 3.

So fixed pattern: R ? B E ?

So four-letter pattern: R, ?, B, E, ?

Possible words? Let me list:

- ""RUBLE"": but L and E? Pattern: R, U, B, L, E? But position 4 is E? Wait, ""RUBLE"": R U B L E -> position 4 is L, but we need position 4 to be E? No, our pattern requires position 4 to be E. So ""RUBLE"" has E at 5? Not matching.

We must have E at position 4. So last letter is not E? Unless duplicated? But we don't know about duplicates.

Possible: 
- ""RIBES"" as I said: R I B E S -> matches pattern? 
  Position1: R
  Position2: I
  Position3: B
  Position4: E
  Position5: S

Yes, ""RIBES"" is a valid word.

- ""RUBES"": R U B E S -> 
  Position1: R
  Position2: U
  Position3: B
  Position4: E
  Position5: S

Also valid.

- ""RABES"" but R A B E S? A is absent? Not allowed.

- ""ROBES"": O absent? Not allowed.

- ""RUBEL""? R U B E L -> position 4 is E? But then L at 5? But that's 5 letters. ""RUBEL"" is a currency? But valid? Actually, it's R U B E L.

But in our pattern, we have R ? B E L? That would be R at1, ? at2, B at3, E at4, L at5. So ""RUBEL"" is R U B E L -> positions: 1:R, 2:U, 3:B, 4:E, 5:L.

So ""RUBEL"" is a possibility? But we don't know if U and L are allowed.

But we have two classes: RIBES, RUBES, RUBEL, etc.

But we also have ""RIPES"": R I P E S? But P is not at position 3? We need position 3 to be B! So not possible.

Similarly, ""RIFLE"": R I F L E -> position 3 is F? Not B.

With B at 3 and E at 4: 
- Other words: ""ROBED"" we already tried? But we know D is absent? Not the same.

Not many words have the pattern R?BES?

Actually, common words? ""RABID"" but A and D absent? And not matching pattern (position4 would be I?).

Another word: ""REBUS"" but that's R E B U S? Position1: R, position2: E? But we have E at position4? And if position2 is E? But we know the secret word has E at position4? That doesn't forbid E at other positions? However, in ""REBUS"", position2 is E? Also, position3 is B? So R E B U S? This might be a word? But in the pattern, our position2 is not fixed? Only that we know that E is at position4, but possibly it can be elsewhere?

But we know E is at position4? Does that mean it might be only at position4? Or could be duplicated? We don't know yet.

In the first guess, we had E at position5? And that was marked as present but wrong? And now in the second guess, E at position4 is marked correct? So E is at position4? It may or may not appear elsewhere.

Similarly, R? We have R at position1, but it could be elsewhere? However, in the first guess, we had R at position2? And that was marked as present? But now that R is fixed at position1, it could be that R is only at position1? Or duplicated? But no other information.

So, for the pattern: R at1, then a letter, then B at3, then E at4, then a letter.

Possibilities: 
- The last letter is the only one missing? And we need to choose one that is not excluded.

Common words: 
- ""RIBES"" (valid): letters I and S. 
- ""RUBES"" (valid): U and S.
- ""RUBEL"": U and L.
- ""JUMPS"" not matching.

Also, ""CABIN"" but C absent and not matching.

Other possibility: ""RBC"" wait no.

We need to test.

But note: we have only one missing position? Actually, two missing positions: position2 and position5.

We know the secret word is of the form: R ? B E ?

We need to fill the two blanks with letters that are not C, A, N, O, D.

Let's think: 
The set of allowed letters includes: F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we can try to guess a word that fills both blanks and is valid.

For example, ""RIPEN"" but N absent? No.

How about ""RIDES""? But we need B at position3? Position3 would be D? But we have B fixed at position3? So no.

Another idea: ""WRITE"" not matching.

Or ""LIVER"" not matching.

So limited options: 

- ""RIBES"" : I (position2), S (position5)
- ""RUBES"" : U (position2), S (position5)
- ""RUBEL"" : U (position2), L (position5)
- ""RABAT"" but not matching and A absent.
- ""ROBES"" but O absent.
- ""RUMBA"" but U, M, A? A absent? And position3 is B? Position4 is A? But we need E at position4? So not matching.
- ""CUBES"" but C absent.
- ""TUBES"" T at1? But we need R at1.

Only a few words match the pattern.

We can try ""RIBES"", but we are not sure.

However, we have more information: from the first guess, we had R and E. And now we have exact positions. But we need to confirm the missing letters.

But we are allowed to guess one of these.

Also, note: in the first guess, ""crane"" we had E at position5? And that was wrong? So the secret word does not have E at position5? So if we guess a word with E at position5? But that would be inconsistent? Actually, ""RIBES"" has S at position5? Not E? So that's okay.

Similarly, ""RUBES"" has S at position5? ""RUBEL"" has L at position5.

We don't have positive information about S or L? So they could be present?

We need to choose a word that tests common letters? Or we can use one of these.

Since we have three letters fixed: R, B, E? And we only have two positions unknown? We might guess correctly now.

But we have multiple options? ""RIBES"", ""RUBES"", ""RUBEL"", maybe ""RUBLE"" (variant of ROUBLE)?

""RUBLE"" is also a valid word: same as RUBEL? R U B L E.

We can choose one to test.

But note: we only have two positions: position2 and position5. So if we guess incorrectly, we get information? But we have limited tries.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses letters we haven't tried yet? To cover more possibilities.

For example, we might guess ""RISES""? But position3 is S? We need B? So no.

We cannot change positions1,3,4? Because they are fixed: R, B, E.

So any guess must have R at1, B at3, E at4? So the pattern is fixed: R ? B E ?

Therefore, we must guess with that pattern.

So we should choose a word that matches this pattern and uses letters that have not been excluded? And we haven't tried many letters? We only know C, A, N, O, D are absent? And we know R, B, E exact? So we need to fill the two blanks.

Possible words:

- ""RIBES"" : I in position2, S in position5
- ""RUBES"" : U in position2, S in position5
- ""RUBEL"" : U in position2, L in position5
- ""RUBLE"" : U in position2, E in position5? But E at position5? But we know from the first guess that E is not at position5? Because in ""crane"", position5 was E, marked as wrong position? Not necessarily that E cannot be at position5? Actually, the feedback was ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not at position5? So E cannot be at position5? Because if it were, it would be marked correct? But since it was marked as present but wrong position? So E is in the word, but at a position different from position5? And now we know it's at position4? So E cannot be duplicated at position5? Therefore, the secret word has E only at position4? So position5 cannot be E? Therefore, the word ""RUBLE"" would have E at position4 and E at position5? But because E is already placed at position4, if there is no duplicate, then position5 cannot be E? But we don't know for sure.

Let me clarify: the first guess ""crane"" had E at position5? And that E was marked as present but not at that position? So the secret word has at least one E and it is not at position5? The second guess ""robed"" had E at position4? It was marked correct? So now the secret word has E at position4? But if it has only one E, then position5 cannot be E? But if it has two E's, then position5 could be E? However, if there were two E's, then in the first guess, we would have seen only one E marked? But the feedback would be: when guessing a letter that appears twice? Actually, in Wordle, if you guess the same letter twice? Then if one instance is correct or present? It may show accordingly? But in this case, we did not guess two E's? So we don't know.

To be safe, we should avoid assuming duplicates? But it's possible.

But the pattern R?BES: R ? B E S? So ending with S is common? Like ""ribes"", ""rubes"", ""ruble"" ends with E? Which we think might not be possible? Because E at position5 is not allowed? But ""ruble"" has E at position5? Is that allowed? Wait, no: because we know from first guess that E is not at position5? So if we have a word with E at position5? Then if E is also at position4? Then it would be duplicated E? And that's possible? But the first guess ""crane"" had E at position5? And that was marked as present but wrong? So there is at least one E? And it's not at position5? If the secret word has E at position5? Then it would be a duplicate E? But the first guess would have shown E at position5 as present? Because the secret word has E at position5? So it should be marked as present? But the feedback was: for E at position5, it was marked as present but wrong? Wait, no: the rule: if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, mark as ""-"". But if the secret word has E at position5, then if we guess E at position5, it should be marked as ""✓"" (correct)? But in the first guess, it was ""-"", so it is not correct? Therefore, the secret word does not have E at position5? So if we have a word with E at position5? Then that E would be marked as ""x"" maybe? Or ""-""? Actually, if the secret word has E at position4, and we guess E at position5? Then it would show ""-"" for position5? But we know the secret word has E? So if we guess E at a position where it isn't? But it is in the word elsewhere? Then it shows ""-""? However, we already have E at position4? So if we guess E at position5? And the secret word does not have E at position5? Then it would be redundant? But the feedback would depend on whether there is another E? But we don't know if there is a second E.

But to avoid confusion, we should choose a word that does not use E at position5? Because we know the secret word has E at position4? And we don't want to duplicate? But if there is only one E, then we cannot have E at position5? So words like ""RUBLE"" (with E at5) would be invalid if there is only one E? But we don't know? So safer to avoid E at position5? Also, letters that are absent.

Therefore, possible words without E at the end? So ending with a non-E:

- ""RIBES"" : ends with S
- ""RUBES"" : ends with S
- ""RUBEL"" : ends with L? And does not have E? Wait, ""RUBEL"": R U B E L -> position5 is L? It does not have E at position5? Position5 is L? So it's okay.

Similarly, ""RUBLE"": same as RUBEL? R U B L E? Wait: that would be R at1, U at2, B at3, L at4? Then E at5? Oh no: position4 is L? But we need position4 to be E! So for ""RUBLE"", the spelling is usually R-U-B-L-E? So positions: 1:R, 2:U, 3:B, 4:L, 5:E? But we require position4 to be E? So actually, ""RUBLE"" does not match? Because position4 is L? Not E? So we cannot have ""RUBLE"" because it doesn't have E at position4?

We need position4 to be E? So words like ""RUBLE"" have E at position5? And position4 is L? So they don't fit our pattern of having E at position4.

Therefore, the only possibilities that have E at position4 are words ending with a different letter? Like:

- R I B E S : position4 is E? Yes, position4: E? Position5: S? So ""RIBES"".
- R U B E S : ""RUBES"".
- R U B E L : ""RUBEL""? But RUBEL is R U B E L? Then positions: 1:R, 2:U, 3:B, 4:E, 5:L? Yes, it has E at position4? So matches pattern.

Also? ""RABES"" but A absent? No.
""ROBES"" O absent.

So three words? ""RIBES"", ""RUBES"", ""RUBEL"".

We can choose one? But we don't know which one? And we have 5 tries left? Actually we have used 2, so 4 left? No, we have 6 tries? We used 2, so 4 remaining? But perhaps we can guess one? Or use a word that tests as much as possible.

But we have to guess a word that matches the pattern? So we have to pick one? 

We can try with a word that has letters we haven't tested? I and S? Or U and S? Or U and L? That hasn't been tested? 

Looking at the first guess, we tested C, R, A, N, E? And second guess: R, O, B, E, D? So we haven't tested S, I, U, L?

We can guess ""RIBES"" to test I and S? If it is not correct, we get feedback on I and S? Then we can narrow down? Similarly, ""RUBES"" tests U and S? Etc.

Among the options, ""RIBES"" contains I and S? Which are vowels and common? ""RUBES"" contains U and S? U is less common? So ""RIBES"" might be more typical? Or we could choose one.

But to make it arbitrary? I'll choose ""RIBES"".

Alternatively, to cover more ground? But note: the word must match the pattern? So if we guess ""RIBES"", and it is not correct? We might get:

- Position2: I? Marked as wrong? Or not present?
- Position5: S? Marked accordingly.

Then we can deduce.

Similarly for other guesses.

Therefore, I suggest guessing ""RIBES"".

After submitting ""RIBES"", we will receive feedback? And continue.

So next guess: ""RIBES""

Therefore, return <guess>ribes</guess>.Based on the feedback from the two previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)**  
  - This indicates that the secret word does not contain C, A, or N.
  - R is present but not in position 2.
  - E is present but not in position 5.

- **Guess 2: robed → Feedback: R(✓) O(x) B(✓) E(✓) D(x)**  
  - R is correct and in position 1 (so the word starts with R).
  - O is not in the word.
  - B is correct and in position 3 (so the third letter is B).
  - E is correct and in position 4 (so the fourth letter is E).
  - D is not in the word.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word pattern is **R _ B E _** (position 1: R, position 3: B, position 4: E).
- Positions 2 and 5 are unknown.
- Absent letters: **C, A, N, O, D** (cannot appear anywhere).
- Present letters with known positions: **R (pos1), B (pos3), E (pos4)**.
- From Guess 1, E is confirmed present (now at pos4) but not at pos5, so position 5 cannot be E.

### Optimization for Next Guess:
- The goal is to solve the word efficiently by testing plausible candidates for positions 2 and 5 while avoiding excluded letters.
- Only a few valid English words fit the pattern **R _ B E _**:
  - **RIBES** (meaning a genus of plants): Positions: R (1), I (2), B (3), E (4), S (5).
  - **RUBES** (plural of ""rube""): Positions: R (1), U (2), B (3), E (4), S (5).
  - **RUBEL** (variant spelling of ""rouble,"" a currency): Positions: R (1), U (2), B (3), E (4), L (5).
- Other combinations? Words like ""RABES"" or ""ROBES"" are invalid due to excluded A and O.
- **RIBES** is chosen here to test:
  - **I** (vowel, common) in position 2.
  - **S** (common consonant) in position 5.
- If incorrect, feedback on **I** and **S** will help confirm/eliminate **U** or **L** in future guesses.

Actually, no: the feedback only tells us about the position we guessed. \n      It doesn\'t prevent R from being in position 2? Wait, no: because if R were in position 2, it would have been marked as correct (✓). But it was marked as present but wrong position (-), so R is in the word but not at position 2.\n\n 2. Does not include C, A, N.\n\n Also, we want to include other common letters to get more information.\n\n Let\'s think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N.\n\n Common letters we haven\'t tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, H, etc.\n\n We know the word has 5 letters. We have two known letters: R and E.\n\n We can try to put R and E in positions that are not the ones we already tried (so R not at position 2, and E not at position 5).\n\n Also, we have three positions that were wrong: positions 1,3,4 (because we had C, A, N there and they are absent). But note: the feedback doesn\'t tell us about the positions of the absent letters, only that they are absent.\n\n So, for the next guess, we can try:\n\n Let me try to think of a word that has R and E, and three new letters.\n\n Example: ""ROUTE"" -> but we have O, U, T. However, note that we don\'t know if O, U, T are in the word. Also, we must avoid A and N? Actually, we know A and N are not in the word, so we can use other letters.\n\n But wait: we also know that the word does not have C, A, N. So we can use any letters except C, A, N.\n\n However, we must be cautious: we don\'t want to reuse letters that we know are absent? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we know they are not in the word. So we avoid C, A, N.\n\n Let me try to form a word:\n\n We have to place R and E. Since R was not at position 2, we can try R at position 1? But note: we don\'t know if position 1 is R or not. Similarly, E was not at position 5, so we can try E at position 1? But that might be unusual.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to put R at position 3 or 4 or 5? But note: in the first guess, position 5 was E and it was present but wrong, so E is not at position 5. But we don\'t know about position 1,3,4 for R.\n\n However, we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But the feedback doesn\'t indicate that, so we assume no duplicates for now.\n\n Let me think of words without C, A, N, and with R and E.\n\n Some possibilities: \n - ""TRIED"": T, R, I, E, D -> but R is at position 2? We know R is not at position 2? Actually, we know from the first guess that R is not at position 2. But in this new word, if we put R at position 2, then we are repeating the same mistake? We know R is not at position 2, so we should avoid putting R at position 2.\n\n So in ""TRIED"", R is at position 2 -> that\'s the same position we already tried and it was wrong. So we should avoid that.\n\n How about ""RIDER""? But that has two R\'s? We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed, but typically in Wordle, duplicates are possible. However, the feedback for the first guess didn\'t show two R\'s? Actually, we only had one R. So if the word has two R\'s, then when we guessed ""crane"" (which has one R) we would have only gotten one R marked? But the feedback only marks the letters that are present. So if the word has two R\'s and we guess one, we get one R marked. So duplicates are possible.\n\n But to keep it simple, let\'s avoid duplicates for now.\n\n Another word: ""STREP"" -> but we have S, T, R, E, P. And R is at position 3? That\'s a new position. E is at position 4? Also, we avoid position 2 for R and position 5 for E? Actually, in ""STREP"":\n   position 1: S\n   position 2: T\n   position 3: R -> that\'s okay because we haven\'t tried R at position 3? And we know R is not at position 2, but position 3 is new.\n   position 4: E -> and we know E is not at position 5, but position 4 is new.\n   position 5: P\n\n But note: we also have to check if S, T, P are in the word? We don\'t know. This guess will help us.\n\n However, we must make sure the word is valid. ""STREP"" is a valid word (meaning a type of bacteria).\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""ROGUE"": \n   R at position 1 (which is new for R) and E at position 5? But wait, we know E is not at position 5? Because in the first guess, we had E at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong. So if we put E at position 5 again, we know it\'s wrong? But we can do that to test? Actually, we can, but it might be inefficient.\n\n However, the feedback for E at position 5 was that it is present but not at that position. So if we put E at position 5 again, we will get the same feedback? That is, we won\'t get a check for E at position 5 because we know it\'s not there. So it\'s better to try E in a new position.\n\n Therefore, we should avoid putting E at position 5. Similarly, avoid R at position 2.\n\n So ""ROGUE"" has E at position 5 -> not good.\n\n How about ""DRIVE"": \n   D at 1, R at 2 -> but R at position 2 is the same as before? We know R is not at position 2, so we avoid that.\n\n How about ""PRICE"": but we know C is not in the word? So we cannot use C.\n\n How about ""TRIPE"": \n   T, R, I, P, E\n   R at position 2 -> again, we know R is not at position 2? So we avoid.\n\n We need a word that has R not at position 2 and E not at position 5.\n\n Let me try: ""PERKY"" -> P, E, R, K, Y\n   E at position 2? We don\'t know about position 2 for E? But we know E is in the word, but not at position 5. We don\'t know about other positions.\n   R at position 3? That\'s new.\n\n But note: we also have to avoid A, C, N. This word doesn\'t have them.\n\n However, we have Y and K? They are less common, but okay.\n\n Alternatively, ""ROBES"": \n   R at 1, O, B, E at 4, S at 5 -> E is at position 4? That\'s new. And R at position 1? That\'s new.\n\n But we don\'t know if O, B, S are in the word.\n\n Another common word: ""STORE"": \n   S, T, O, R, E -> but R is at position 4? and E at position 5? We know E is not at position 5? So we avoid E at position 5.\n\n How about ""STOLE"": \n   S, T, O, L, E -> but we don\'t have R? We must include R because we know it\'s in the word.\n\n So we need a word that has R and E, and avoids C, A, N.\n\n Let me think: ""RIPER""? But that has two R\'s? And E at the end? We know E is not at position 5? So we avoid.\n\n How about ""RIPEN""? But we know N is not in the word? So we cannot use N.\n\n How about ""RIPED""? Not a common word? Actually, ""riped"" is not a standard word. We need valid words.\n\n Another idea: ""BREAD"" -> but we have A? We know A is not in the word? So we cannot use A.\n\n How about ""BREED""? But that has two E\'s? And we don\'t know if duplicates are there? Also, E at position 5? We know E is not at position 5? So avoid.\n\n How about ""BRUTE"": \n   B, R, U, T, E -> \n   R at position 2? We know R is not at position 2? So avoid.\n\n How about ""URGED"": \n   U, R, G, E, D -> \n   R at position 2? Again, same problem.\n\n How about ""TRIES"": \n   T, R, I, E, S -> \n   R at position 2? Avoid.\n\n How about ""RESIN"": but we know N is not in the word? So no.\n\n How about ""RESET"": \n   R, E, S, E, T -> has two E\'s? And we have E at position 2? We don\'t know if that\'s allowed? But also, we know E is in the word, but we don\'t know if there are two. \n   However, we also have E at position 5? We know E is not at position 5? So the second E at position 5 would be wrong? But we are trying to get information.\n\n But note: we are limited to 5 letters and we know the word has at least one R and one E. We don\'t know about duplicates.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""RODEO""? But that has O and D? And no E? We need E.\n\n After some thought, I found: ""PRIED"": \n   P, R, I, E, D -> \n   R at position 2? Avoid.\n\n How about ""WROTE"": \n   W, R, O, T, E -> \n   R at position 2? Avoid.\n\n How about ""CRWTH""? Not common and we know C is not in the word.\n\n Another idea: ""EMPTY"" -> but no R? We must have R.\n\n How about ""RESTY"": \n   R, E, S, T, Y -> \n   R at position 1? That\'s new.\n   E at position 2? We don\'t know about position 2 for E? It could be correct? \n   But note: we know R is in the word, but we don\'t know if it can be at position 1? We haven\'t tried position 1 for R.\n\n However, we also have to avoid the known absent letters: C, A, N. This word is okay.\n\n But wait: we have E at position 2? We don\'t have any information about E at position 2. It might be correct? Or it might be present but in the wrong position? We don\'t know.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""ROUSE"": \n   R, O, U, S, E -> \n   R at position 1? New.\n   E at position 5? We know E is not at position 5? So we avoid.\n\n How about ""ROBED"": \n   R, O, B, E, D -> \n   R at 1, E at 4? That\'s new for E (previously we had E at 5, now at 4). So that\'s good.\n\n So ""ROBED"" seems acceptable.\n\n But let me check: \n   R at 1: we haven\'t tried that.\n   O, B: new letters.\n   E at 4: we haven\'t tried that.\n\n So we can use ""ROBED"".\n\n However, we might get more information if we use a word that has more common consonants? Like S, T, L.\n\n Another candidate: ""TRIBE"" -> but we have A? No, T, R, I, B, E -> \n   R at position 2? Avoid.\n\n How about ""STIRE""? Not a word.\n\n How about ""SERIF"": \n   S, E, R, I, F -> \n   E at position 2? \n   R at position 3? That\'s new.\n\n This word: ""SERIF"" is valid.\n\n But we have E at position 2? We don\'t know if that\'s correct? And R at position 3? We know R is in the word but not at position 2, so position 3 is a candidate.\n\n Also, we are testing S, E, R, I, F.\n\n Alternatively, ""RICES"" -> but we know C is not in the word? So no.\n\n After considering, I think ""ROBED"" is a valid choice, but let me see if we can do better.\n\n How about ""PRIDE"": \n   P, R, I, D, E -> \n   R at position 2? Avoid.\n\n How about ""DRIVE"": \n   D, R, I, V, E -> \n   R at position 2? Avoid.\n\n How about ""GRIME"": \n   G, R, I, M, E -> \n   R at position 2? Avoid.\n\n How about ""OPTER""? Not common.\n\n Another idea: ""REMIT"": \n   R, E, M, I, T -> \n   R at position 1? New.\n   E at position 2? New.\n\n This is acceptable? But we have E at position 2? We don\'t know if that\'s correct? But we are testing.\n\n However, we are not repeating the same positions for R and E? R is at 1 (new) and E is at 2 (we haven\'t tried E at 2 before). \n\n Also, we are testing M, I, T.\n\n But note: we know the word has R and E, so we are covering that.\n\n Alternatively, ""REBUS"": \n   R, E, B, U, S -> \n   R at 1, E at 2? Same as above.\n\n But we are testing B, U, S.\n\n I think ""REBUS"" is a valid word (meaning a puzzle).\n\n However, we are using E at position 2? We don\'t have any information that E is not at position 2? So it\'s okay.\n\n But we might get more information if we use a word that has the R and E in positions that are more likely to be correct? Actually, we don\'t know.\n\n Another common word: ""ADIEU"" -> but we know A is not in the word? So no.\n\n After careful thought, I choose ""ROBED"". \n\n Why? \n - It has R at position 1 (which we haven\'t tried) and E at position 4 (which is new, since we only know E is not at 5).\n - It avoids the letters C, A, N.\n - It uses new common letters: O, B, D.\n\n So, second guess: ""ROBED""\n\n Let me write it: \n   R at 1, O at 2, B at 3, E at 4, D at 5.\n\n We hope to get feedback on these.\n\n If the feedback shows:\n   If R at 1 is correct, we get a check.\n   If E at 4 is correct, we get a check.\n\n And we\'ll know about O, B, D.\n\n So, I\'ll go with ""ROBED"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, A, and N are not in the word (marked ""x"").\n- R is in the word but not in position 2 (marked ""-"").\n- E is in the word but not in position 5 (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include R and E (since they are in the secret word), but avoid placing R in position 2 or E in position 5.\n- Must exclude C, A, and N (since they are absent).\n- Aim to test new common letters (e.g., B, O, D) and new positions for R and E.\n\nThe word ""ROBED"" fits these criteria:\n- Places R in position 1 (new position, not tested before).\n- Places E in position 4 (new position, avoiding position 5).\n- Uses new letters: O, B, D (all untested).\n- Excludes C, A, N.\n\nThis guess will help identify the positions of R and E while testing three new letters.\n\n<guess>robed</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: robed -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) O(x) B(✓) E(✓) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nMeaning:\n- C, A, N are not in the word.\n- R is in the word but not at position 2.\n- E is in the word but not at position 5.\n\nGuess 2: ""robed"" -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) O(x) B(✓) E(✓) D(x)\nMeaning:\n- R is correct at position 1 (so the secret word starts with R).\n- O is not in the word.\n- B is correct at position 3 (so the third letter is B).\n- E is correct at position 4 (so the fourth letter is E).\n- D is not in the word.\n\nNow, combining the information:\n- The secret word starts with R, has B at position 3, and E at position 4.

But let\'s see: positions: R at 1, I at 2, B at 3, E at 4, S at 5. So ""RIBES"".\n\nBut we don\'t know if I and S are allowed? We haven\'t ruled out I or S.\n\nOther possibilities:\n- R U B E S? ""RUBES"" is not common? It\'s plural of rube? But valid.\n- R O B E S? But O is ruled out? We know O is absent. So not possible.\n- R A B E S? But A is absent? No.\n- R H Y M E? But that has Y and M? And H? But pattern: R at 1, H at 2? But then at 3 would be Y? But we need B at 3? Wait, no: we know position 3 is B. So the word must have B at position 3.\n\nSo fixed pattern: R ? B E ?\n\nSo four-letter pattern: R, ?, B, E, ?\n\nPossible words? Let me list:\n\n- ""RUBLE"": but L and E? Pattern: R, U, B, L, E? But position 4 is E? Wait, ""RUBLE"": R U B L E -> position 4 is L, but we need position 4 to be E? No, our pattern requires position 4 to be E. So ""RUBLE"" has E at 5? Not matching.\n\nWe must have E at position 4. So last letter is not E? Unless duplicated? But we don\'t know about duplicates.\n\nPossible: \n- ""RIBES"" as I said: R I B E S -> matches pattern? \n  Position1: R\n  Position2: I\n  Position3: B\n  Position4: E\n  Position5: S\n\nYes, ""RIBES"" is a valid word.\n\n- ""RUBES"": R U B E S -> \n  Position1: R\n  Position2: U\n  Position3: B\n  Position4: E\n  Position5: S\n\nAlso valid.\n\n- ""RABES"" but R A B E S? A is absent? Not allowed.\n\n- ""ROBES"": O absent? Not allowed.\n\n- ""RUBEL""? R U B E L -> position 4 is E? But then L at 5? But that\'s 5 letters. ""RUBEL"" is a currency? But valid? Actually, it\'s R U B E L.\n\nBut in our pattern, we have R ? B E L? That would be R at1, ? at2, B at3, E at4, L at5. So ""RUBEL"" is R U B E L -> positions: 1:R, 2:U, 3:B, 4:E, 5:L.\n\nSo ""RUBEL"" is a possibility? But we don\'t know if U and L are allowed.\n\nBut we have two classes: RIBES, RUBES, RUBEL, etc.\n\nBut we also have ""RIPES"": R I P E S? But P is not at position 3? We need position 3 to be B! So not possible.\n\nSimilarly, ""RIFLE"": R I F L E -> position 3 is F? Not B.\n\nWith B at 3 and E at 4: \n- Other words: ""ROBED"" we already tried? But we know D is absent? Not the same.\n\nNot many words have the pattern R?BES?\n\nActually, common words? ""RABID"" but A and D absent? And not matching pattern (position4 would be I?).\n\nAnother word: ""REBUS"" but that\'s R E B U S? Position1: R, position2: E? But we have E at position4? And if position2 is E? But we know the secret word has E at position4? That doesn\'t forbid E at other positions? However, in ""REBUS"", position2 is E? Also, position3 is B? So R E B U S? This might be a word? But in the pattern, our position2 is not fixed? Only that we know that E is at position4, but possibly it can be elsewhere?\n\nBut we know E is at position4? Does that mean it might be only at position4? Or could be duplicated? We don\'t know yet.\n\nIn the first guess, we had E at position5? And that was marked as present but wrong? And now in the second guess, E at position4 is marked correct? So E is at position4? It may or may not appear elsewhere.\n\nSimilarly, R? We have R at position1, but it could be elsewhere? However, in the first guess, we had R at position2? And that was marked as present? But now that R is fixed at position1, it could be that R is only at position1? Or duplicated? But no other information.\n\nSo, for the pattern: R at1, then a letter, then B at3, then E at4, then a letter.\n\nPossibilities: \n- The last letter is the only one missing? And we need to choose one that is not excluded.\n\nCommon words: \n- ""RIBES"" (valid): letters I and S. \n- ""RUBES"" (valid): U and S.\n- ""RUBEL"": U and L.\n- ""JUMPS"" not matching.\n\nAlso, ""CABIN"" but C absent and not matching.\n\nOther possibility: ""RBC"" wait no.\n\nWe need to test.\n\nBut note: we have only one missing position? Actually, two missing positions: position2 and position5.\n\nWe know the secret word is of the form: R ? B E ?\n\nWe need to fill the two blanks with letters that are not C, A, N, O, D.\n\nLet\'s think: \nThe set of allowed letters includes: F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we can try to guess a word that fills both blanks and is valid.\n\nFor example, ""RIPEN"" but N absent? No.\n\nHow about ""RIDES""? But we need B at position3? Position3 would be D? But we have B fixed at position3? So no.\n\nAnother idea: ""WRITE"" not matching.\n\nOr ""LIVER"" not matching.\n\nSo limited options: \n\n- ""RIBES"" : I (position2), S (position5)\n- ""RUBES"" : U (position2), S (position5)\n- ""RUBEL"" : U (position2), L (position5)\n- ""RABAT"" but not matching and A absent.\n- ""ROBES"" but O absent.\n- ""RUMBA"" but U, M, A? A absent? And position3 is B? Position4 is A? But we need E at position4? So not matching.\n- ""CUBES"" but C absent.\n- ""TUBES"" T at1? But we need R at1.\n\nOnly a few words match the pattern.\n\nWe can try ""RIBES"", but we are not sure.\n\nHowever, we have more information: from the first guess, we had R and E. And now we have exact positions. But we need to confirm the missing letters.\n\nBut we are allowed to guess one of these.\n\nAlso, note: in the first guess, ""crane"" we had E at position5? And that was wrong? So the secret word does not have E at position5? So if we guess a word with E at position5? But that would be inconsistent? Actually, ""RIBES"" has S at position5? Not E? So that\'s okay.\n\nSimilarly, ""RUBES"" has S at position5? ""RUBEL"" has L at position5.\n\nWe don\'t have positive information about S or L? So they could be present?\n\nWe need to choose a word that tests common letters? Or we can use one of these.\n\nSince we have three letters fixed: R, B, E? And we only have two positions unknown? We might guess correctly now.\n\nBut we have multiple options? ""RIBES"", ""RUBES"", ""RUBEL"", maybe ""RUBLE"" (variant of ROUBLE)?\n\n""RUBLE"" is also a valid word: same as RUBEL? R U B L E.\n\nWe can choose one to test.\n\nBut note: we only have two positions: position2 and position5. So if we guess incorrectly, we get information? But we have limited tries.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that uses letters we haven\'t tried yet? To cover more possibilities.\n\nFor example, we might guess ""RISES""? But position3 is S? We need B? So no.\n\nWe cannot change positions1,3,4? Because they are fixed: R, B, E.\n\nSo any guess must have R at1, B at3, E at4? So the pattern is fixed: R ? B E ?\n\nTherefore, we must guess with that pattern.\n\nSo we should choose a word that matches this pattern and uses letters that have not been excluded? And we haven\'t tried many letters? We only know C, A, N, O, D are absent? And we know R, B, E exact? So we need to fill the two blanks.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""RIBES"" : I in position2, S in position5\n- ""RUBES"" : U in position2, S in position5\n- ""RUBEL"" : U in position2, L in position5\n- ""RUBLE"" : U in position2, E in position5? But E at position5? But we know from the first guess that E is not at position5? Because in ""crane"", position5 was E, marked as wrong position? Not necessarily that E cannot be at position5? Actually, the feedback was ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not at position5? So E cannot be at position5? Because if it were, it would be marked correct? But since it was marked as present but wrong position? So E is in the word, but at a position different from position5? And now we know it\'s at position4? So E cannot be duplicated at position5? Therefore, the secret word has E only at position4? So position5 cannot be E? Therefore, the word ""RUBLE"" would have E at position4 and E at position5? But because E is already placed at position4, if there is no duplicate, then position5 cannot be E? But we don\'t know for sure.\n\nLet me clarify: the first guess ""crane"" had E at position5? And that E was marked as present but not at that position? So the secret word has at least one E and it is not at position5? The second guess ""robed"" had E at position4? It was marked correct? So now the secret word has E at position4? But if it has only one E, then position5 cannot be E? But if it has two E\'s, then position5 could be E? However, if there were two E\'s, then in the first guess, we would have seen only one E marked? But the feedback would be: when guessing a letter that appears twice? Actually, in Wordle, if you guess the same letter twice? Then if one instance is correct or present? It may show accordingly? But in this case, we did not guess two E\'s? So we don\'t know.\n\nTo be safe, we should avoid assuming duplicates? But it\'s possible.\n\nBut the pattern R?BES: R ? B E S? So ending with S is common? Like ""ribes"", ""rubes"", ""ruble"" ends with E? Which we think might not be possible? Because E at position5 is not allowed? But ""ruble"" has E at position5? Is that allowed? Wait, no: because we know from first guess that E is not at position5? So if we have a word with E at position5? Then if E is also at position4? Then it would be duplicated E? And that\'s possible? But the first guess ""crane"" had E at position5? And that was marked as present but wrong? So there is at least one E? And it\'s not at position5? If the secret word has E at position5? Then it would be a duplicate E? But the first guess would have shown E at position5 as present? Because the secret word has E at position5? So it should be marked as present? But the feedback was: for E at position5, it was marked as present but wrong? Wait, no: the rule: if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, mark as ""-"". But if the secret word has E at position5, then if we guess E at position5, it should be marked as ""✓"" (correct)? But in the first guess, it was ""-"", so it is not correct? Therefore, the secret word does not have E at position5? So if we have a word with E at position5? Then that E would be marked as ""x"" maybe? Or ""-""? Actually, if the secret word has E at position4, and we guess E at position5? Then it would show ""-"" for position5? But we know the secret word has E? So if we guess E at a position where it isn\'t? But it is in the word elsewhere? Then it shows ""-""? However, we already have E at position4? So if we guess E at position5? And the secret word does not have E at position5? Then it would be redundant? But the feedback would depend on whether there is another E? But we don\'t know if there is a second E.\n\nBut to avoid confusion, we should choose a word that does not use E at position5? Because we know the secret word has E at position4? And we don\'t want to duplicate? But if there is only one E, then we cannot have E at position5? So words like ""RUBLE"" (with E at5) would be invalid if there is only one E? But we don\'t know? So safer to avoid E at position5? Also, letters that are absent.\n\nTherefore, possible words without E at the end? So ending with a non-E:\n\n- ""RIBES"" : ends with S\n- ""RUBES"" : ends with S\n- ""RUBEL"" : ends with L? And does not have E? Wait, ""RUBEL"": R U B E L -> position5 is L? It does not have E at position5? Position5 is L? So it\'s okay.\n\nSimilarly, ""RUBLE"": same as RUBEL? R U B L E? Wait: that would be R at1, U at2, B at3, L at4? Then E at5? Oh no: position4 is L? But we need position4 to be E! So for ""RUBLE"", the spelling is usually R-U-B-L-E? So positions: 1:R, 2:U, 3:B, 4:L, 5:E? But we require position4 to be E? So actually, ""RUBLE"" does not match? Because position4 is L? Not E? So we cannot have ""RUBLE"" because it doesn\'t have E at position4?\n\nWe need position4 to be E? So words like ""RUBLE"" have E at position5? And position4 is L? So they don\'t fit our pattern of having E at position4.\n\nTherefore, the only possibilities that have E at position4 are words ending with a different letter? Like:\n\n- R I B E S : position4 is E? Yes, position4: E? Position5: S? So ""RIBES"".\n- R U B E S : ""RUBES"".\n- R U B E L : ""RUBEL""? But RUBEL is R U B E L? Then positions: 1:R, 2:U, 3:B, 4:E, 5:L? Yes, it has E at position4? So matches pattern.\n\nAlso? ""RABES"" but A absent? No.\n""ROBES"" O absent.\n\nSo three words? ""RIBES"", ""RUBES"", ""RUBEL"".\n\nWe can choose one? But we don\'t know which one? And we have 5 tries left? Actually we have used 2, so 4 left? No, we have 6 tries? We used 2, so 4 remaining? But perhaps we can guess one? Or use a word that tests as much as possible.\n\nBut we have to guess a word that matches the pattern? So we have to pick one? \n\nWe can try with a word that has letters we haven\'t tested? I and S? Or U and S? Or U and L? That hasn\'t been tested? \n\nLooking at the first guess, we tested C, R, A, N, E? And second guess: R, O, B, E, D? So we haven\'t tested S, I, U, L?\n\nWe can guess ""RIBES"" to test I and S? If it is not correct, we get feedback on I and S? Then we can narrow down? Similarly, ""RUBES"" tests U and S? Etc.\n\nAmong the options, ""RIBES"" contains I and S? Which are vowels and common? ""RUBES"" contains U and S? U is less common? So ""RIBES"" might be more typical? Or we could choose one.\n\nBut to make it arbitrary? I\'ll choose ""RIBES"".\n\nAlternatively, to cover more ground? But note: the word must match the pattern? So if we guess ""RIBES"", and it is not correct? We might get:\n\n- Position2: I? Marked as wrong? Or not present?\n- Position5: S? Marked accordingly.\n\nThen we can deduce.\n\nSimilarly for other guesses.\n\nTherefore, I suggest guessing ""RIBES"".\n\nAfter submitting ""RIBES"", we will receive feedback? And continue.\n\nSo next guess: ""RIBES""\n\nTherefore, return <guess>ribes</guess>.Based on the feedback from the two previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: crane → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)**  \n  - This indicates that the secret word does not contain C, A, or N.\n  - R is present but not in position 2.\n  - E is present but not in position 5.\n\n- **Guess 2: robed → Feedback: R(✓) O(x) B(✓) E(✓) D(x)**  \n  - R is correct and in position 1 (so the word starts with R).\n  - O is not in the word.\n  - B is correct and in position 3 (so the third letter is B).\n  - E is correct and in position 4 (so the fourth letter is E).\n  - D is not in the word.\n\n### Key Insights:\n- The secret word pattern is **R _ B E _** (position 1: R, position 3: B, position 4: E).\n- Positions 2 and 5 are unknown.\n- Absent letters: **C, A, N, O, D** (cannot appear anywhere).\n- Present letters with known positions: **R (pos1), B (pos3), E (pos4)**.\n- From Guess 1, E is confirmed present (now at pos4) but not at pos5, so position 5 cannot be E.\n\n### Optimization for Next Guess:\n- The goal is to solve the word efficiently by testing plausible candidates for positions 2 and 5 while avoiding excluded letters.\n- Only a few valid English words fit the pattern **R _ B E _**:\n  - **RIBES** (meaning a genus of plants): Positions: R (1), I (2), B (3), E (4), S (5).\n  - **RUBES** (plural of ""rube""): Positions: R (1), U (2), B (3), E (4), S (5).\n  - **RUBEL** (variant spelling of ""rouble,"" a currency): Positions: R (1), U (2), B (3), E (4), L (5).\n- Other combinations?

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Meaning:
- C, A, N are absent.
- R is present but not in position 2.
- E is present but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""robed"" -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) O(x) B(✓) E(✓) D(x)
Meaning:
- R is correct at position 1.
- O is absent.
- B is correct at position 3.
- E is correct at position 4.
- D is absent.

Guess 3: ""ribes"" -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) I(x) B(✓) E(✓) S(x)
Meaning:
- R is correct at position 1 (already known).
- I is absent.
- B is correct at position 3 (already known).
- E is correct at position 4 (already known).
- S is absent.

Now, combining all information:

- The secret word starts with R, has B at position 3, and E at position 4. So the pattern is: R _ B E _
- Known absent letters: C, A, N, O, D, I, S (from the feedback: C, A, N from guess1; O, D from guess2; I, S from guess3).
- We also know that the word contains R, B, E (with fixed positions) and one more letter that we haven't identified? Actually, we know there are two missing letters: position 2 and position 5? But we have only one missing letter? No: the word has 5 letters, and we know positions 1,3,4: R, B, E. So positions 2 and 5 are unknown.

But we have ruled out many letters: C, A, N, O, D, I, S.

Also, from the first guess, we know that R and E are in the word (now fixed) and we have no indication of duplicates? So we assume no duplicates for now? But we cannot be sure.

The remaining letters for positions 2 and 5 must be from the letters not excluded.

Excluded letters: A, C, D, I, N, O, S.

So allowed letters: B, E, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, R, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: we already have B, E, R in the word? And if there are no duplicates, then we cannot use B, E, R again? But we are missing two letters? So we need two new letters? But we have R, B, E already? So the other two must be different? Unless duplicates? But we have no evidence of duplicates.

So we assume no duplicates? Then the letters for position 2 and 5 must be from: F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we also know that the word must be valid.

Now, the pattern: R ? B E ?

We need to fill position 2 and position 5 with two distinct letters from the allowed set? And not B, E, R? (if no duplicates).

Now, what words fit this pattern?

We had ""RUBES"" and ""RUBEL"" as possibilities? But ""RUBES"" has S? But S is absent? So ""RUBES"" is invalid? Because S is absent? Similarly, ""RIBES"" we tried and S is absent? So ""RUBES"" also has S? So invalid.

""RUBEL"": R U B E L -> position2: U, position5: L? But we haven't ruled out U and L? So it is possible.

Are there other words?

For example:
- ""RUBLE"": same as RUBEL? But spelling: R U B L E? Then position4 would be L? But we need position4 to be E? So no? ""RUBLE"" is R-U-B-L-E, so positions: 1:R, 2:U, 3:B, 4:L, 5:E? But we require position4 to be E? So it doesn't match.

""RUBEL"" is R-U-B-E-L? Then positions: 1:R, 2:U, 3:B, 4:E, 5:L? Yes, that matches.

Other words? 
- ""RABAT"" but A absent? No.
- ""ROBED"" we tried? D absent? And O absent? No.
- ""RUMBA"" but M? And A absent? And position4 is A? But we need E? No.
- ""CUBED"" but C and D absent? No.
- ""TUBER"" but T? But position1 is T? We need R? No.

How about ""RULER""? But that has R at the end? And two R's? But we have R at position1? So if we have ""RULER"": R U L E R? Then positions: 1:R, 2:U, 3:L, 4:E, 5:R? But we need position3 to be B? So not matching.

Another word: ""RUBY"" is 4 letters? No.

""RUBLE"": same as RUBEL? But RUBEL is an alternative spelling? Or ""ROUBLE""? But O absent? So RUBEL is acceptable.

But are there other words? For example, ""RUBEFY""? Too long.

""JUBE"" is 4 letters.

Perhaps ""RUBEL"" is the only common word? But let's think of more.

""RUBES"" is out because of S? And ""RIBES"" is out? So only ""RUBEL"" remains? But we have to check if U and L are allowed? We haven't ruled them out.

But we also have ""RUBLE""? But that's the same as RUBEL? Or ""ROUBLE"" with O? Absent.

Another possibility: ""RUBIN""? But N absent? And position4 would be I? But we need E? And I is absent? So no.

""RUBID""? But D absent? And position4 I? No.

So ""RUBEL"" seems a candidate.

But we need to confirm: is ""RUBEL"" a valid word? Yes, it is a variant of rouble, a currency unit.

But we have another candidate? What about ""RUMEN""? But M? And position4 E? But then N? But N is absent? So no.

""RUPEE"": R U P E E? But that has two E's? And position3 is P? Not B? So no.

""RUBIO"": O absent? And I? But I is absent? And O absent? No.

So the only candidate we have is ""RUBEL"".

But we must consider that the word might have duplicates? For example, if the secret word has two E's? But we have E at position4? And if position5 is E? But we know from the first guess that E is not at position5? So position5 cannot be E? Because if it were, the first guess would have shown E at position5 as correct? Or at least present? But it was present but not at position5? So if there were two E's, and one is at position4? Then position5 could be E? But then in the first guess, when we guessed E at position5? It would be marked as present? Because there is an E at position5? But it was marked as present? But the feedback for E was ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not at that position? So if the secret word had E at position5, then when we guess E at position5, it should be marked as correct (✓)? But it was not? It was marked as present but wrong position? So that means the secret word does not have E at position5? Therefore, position5 cannot be E? So no duplicate E at position5.

Similarly, for other letters? We have no indication of duplicates? So we assume no duplicates? Then the secret word has exactly the letters R, B, E, and two others? Which are not excluded? And not R, B, E.

Therefore, we can guess ""RUBEL"".

But we have to make sure? We have not tested U and L? So if we guess ""RUBEL"", we might get:

- If correct, we win.
- If not, we get feedback on U and L? Then we can adjust.

But since we have only one candidate? We can try.

Alternatively, are there other words? 

What about ""RUBEY""? Not a word.

""RUBED""? D absent? And E at position4? But D absent.

""RUBEX""? Not common? And X? But we can check? ""RUBEX"" is not a standard word? 

""RUBIS""? But S absent? And I absent? No.

So I think ""RUBEL"" is the only common word.

Therefore, we guess ""RUBEL"".

So next guess: ""RUBEL""

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:

1. **Guess 1: crane → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)**  
   - **C, A, N** are absent.  
   - **R** is present but not in position 2.  
   - **E** is present but not in position 5.  

2. **Guess 2: robed → Feedback: R(✓) O(x) B(✓) E(✓) D(x)**  
   - **R** is correct at position 1.  
   - **O** is absent.  
   - **B** is correct at position 3.  
   - **E** is correct at position 4.  
   - **D** is absent.  
   - **Pattern so far**: `R _ B E _` (positions 1, 3, and 4 are fixed).  

3. **Guess 3: ribes → Feedback: R(✓) I(x) B(✓) E(✓) S(x)**  
   - **I** is absent.  
   - **S** is absent.  
   - Confirms **R**, **B**, and **E** in their correct positions (1, 3, 4).  

### Key Insights:
- **Secret word pattern**: `R _ B E _` (positions 2 and 5 are unknown).  
- **Absent letters**: A, C, D, I, N, O, S (cannot appear).  
- **Present letters with known positions**:  
  - **R** (position 1), **B** (position 3), **E** (position 4).  
- **Constraints for positions 2 and 5**:  
  - Must be letters **not** in the absent list (A, C, D, I, N, O, S).  
  - Cannot be **R**, **B**, or **E** (assuming no duplicates, as no feedback suggests duplicates).  
  - Position 5 cannot be **E** (from Guess 1 feedback).  
- **Possible letters for positions 2 and 5**: F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

### Candidate Words:
- The only common English word fitting `R _ B E _` with the constraints is **RUBEL** (a currency unit):  
  - **R** (pos1), **U** (pos2), **B** (pos3), **E** (pos4), **L** (pos5).  
- Other possibilities like ""RUBES"" or ""RIBES"" are invalid (S is absent). ""RUBLE"" does not fit (it requires E at position 5, which is invalid).  

### Strategy:
- **RUBEL** tests **U** (position 2) and **L** (position 5), both untested letters.  
- If correct, the game ends. If not, feedback on **U** and **L** will confirm/eliminate them, narrowing to other rare words (e.g., ""RUBY"" is 4 letters; ""RUMEN"" has absent N).  

<guess>rubel</guess>",rubel,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Meaning:
- C, A, N are absent.
- R is present but not in position 2.
- E is present but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""robed"" -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) O(x) B(✓) E(✓) D(x)
Meaning:
- R is correct at position 1.
- O is absent.
- B is correct at position 3.
- E is correct at position 4.
- D is absent.

Guess 3: ""ribes"" -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) I(x) B(✓) E(✓) S(x)
Meaning:
- R is correct at position 1 (already known).
- I is absent.
- B is correct at position 3 (already known).
- E is correct at position 4 (already known).
- S is absent.

Now, combining all information:

- The secret word starts with R, has B at position 3, and E at position 4. So the pattern is: R _ B E _
- Known absent letters: C, A, N, O, D, I, S (from the feedback: C, A, N from guess1; O, D from guess2; I, S from guess3).
- We also know that the word contains R, B, E (with fixed positions) and one more letter that we haven't identified? Actually, we know there are two missing letters: position 2 and position 5? But we have only one missing letter? No: the word has 5 letters, and we know positions 1,3,4: R, B, E. So positions 2 and 5 are unknown.

But we have ruled out many letters: C, A, N, O, D, I, S.

Also, from the first guess, we know that R and E are in the word (now fixed) and we have no indication of duplicates? So we assume no duplicates for now? But we cannot be sure.

The remaining letters for positions 2 and 5 must be from the letters not excluded.

Excluded letters: A, C, D, I, N, O, S.

So allowed letters: B, E, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, R, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: we already have B, E, R in the word? And if there are no duplicates, then we cannot use B, E, R again? But we are missing two letters? So we need two new letters? But we have R, B, E already? So the other two must be different? Unless duplicates? But we have no evidence of duplicates.

So we assume no duplicates? Then the letters for position 2 and 5 must be from: F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we also know that the word must be valid.

Now, the pattern: R ? B E ?

We need to fill position 2 and position 5 with two distinct letters from the allowed set? And not B, E, R? (if no duplicates).

Now, what words fit this pattern?

We had ""RUBES"" and ""RUBEL"" as possibilities? But ""RUBES"" has S? But S is absent? So ""RUBES"" is invalid? Because S is absent? Similarly, ""RIBES"" we tried and S is absent? So ""RUBES"" also has S? So invalid.

""RUBEL"": R U B E L -> position2: U, position5: L? But we haven't ruled out U and L? So it is possible.

Are there other words?

For example:
- ""RUBLE"": same as RUBEL? But spelling: R U B L E? Then position4 would be L? But we need position4 to be E? So no? ""RUBLE"" is R-U-B-L-E, so positions: 1:R, 2:U, 3:B, 4:L, 5:E? But we require position4 to be E? So it doesn't match.

""RUBEL"" is R-U-B-E-L? Then positions: 1:R, 2:U, 3:B, 4:E, 5:L? Yes, that matches.

Other words? 
- ""RABAT"" but A absent? No.
- ""ROBED"" we tried? D absent? And O absent? No.
- ""RUMBA"" but M? And A absent? And position4 is A? But we need E? No.
- ""CUBED"" but C and D absent? No.
- ""TUBER"" but T? But position1 is T? We need R? No.

How about ""RULER""? But that has R at the end? And two R's? But we have R at position1? So if we have ""RULER"": R U L E R? Then positions: 1:R, 2:U, 3:L, 4:E, 5:R? But we need position3 to be B? So not matching.

Another word: ""RUBY"" is 4 letters? No.

""RUBLE"": same as RUBEL? But RUBEL is an alternative spelling? Or ""ROUBLE""? But O absent? So RUBEL is acceptable.

But are there other words? For example, ""RUBEFY""? Too long.

""JUBE"" is 4 letters.

Perhaps ""RUBEL"" is the only common word? But let's think of more.

""RUBES"" is out because of S? And ""RIBES"" is out? So only ""RUBEL"" remains? But we have to check if U and L are allowed? We haven't ruled them out.

But we also have ""RUBLE""? But that's the same as RUBEL? Or ""ROUBLE"" with O? Absent.

Another possibility: ""RUBIN""? But N absent? And position4 would be I? But we need E? And I is absent? So no.

""RUBID""? But D absent? And position4 I? No.

So ""RUBEL"" seems a candidate.

But we need to confirm: is ""RUBEL"" a valid word? Yes, it is a variant of rouble, a currency unit.

But we have another candidate? What about ""RUMEN""? But M? And position4 E? But then N? But N is absent? So no.

""RUPEE"": R U P E E? But that has two E's? And position3 is P? Not B? So no.

""RUBIO"": O absent? And I? But I is absent? And O absent? No.

So the only candidate we have is ""RUBEL"".

But we must consider that the word might have duplicates? For example, if the secret word has two E's? But we have E at position4? And if position5 is E? But we know from the first guess that E is not at position5? So position5 cannot be E? Because if it were, the first guess would have shown E at position5 as correct? Or at least present? But it was present but not at position5? So if there were two E's, and one is at position4? Then position5 could be E? But then in the first guess, when we guessed E at position5? It would be marked as present? Because there is an E at position5? But it was marked as present? But the feedback for E was ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not at that position? So if the secret word had E at position5, then when we guess E at position5, it should be marked as correct (✓)? But it was not? It was marked as present but wrong position? So that means the secret word does not have E at position5? Therefore, position5 cannot be E? So no duplicate E at position5.

Similarly, for other letters? We have no indication of duplicates? So we assume no duplicates? Then the secret word has exactly the letters R, B, E, and two others? Which are not excluded? And not R, B, E.

Therefore, we can guess ""RUBEL"".

But we have to make sure? We have not tested U and L? So if we guess ""RUBEL"", we might get:

- If correct, we win.
- If not, we get feedback on U and L? Then we can adjust.

But since we have only one candidate? We can try.

Alternatively, are there other words? 

What about ""RUBEY""? Not a word.

""RUBED""? D absent? And E at position4? But D absent.

""RUBEX""? Not common? And X? But we can check? ""RUBEX"" is not a standard word? 

""RUBIS""? But S absent? And I absent? No.

So I think ""RUBEL"" is the only common word.

Therefore, we guess ""RUBEL"".

So next guess: ""RUBEL""

1. **Guess 1: crane → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)**  
   - **C, A, N** are absent.  
   - **R** is present but not in position 2.  
   - **E** is present but not in position 5.  

2. **Guess 2: robed → Feedback: R(✓) O(x) B(✓) E(✓) D(x)**  
   - **R** is correct at position 1.  
   - **O** is absent.  
   - **B** is correct at position 3.  
   - **E** is correct at position 4.  
   - **D** is absent.  
   - **Pattern so far**: `R _ B E _` (positions 1, 3, and 4 are fixed).  

3. **Guess 3: ribes → Feedback: R(✓) I(x) B(✓) E(✓) S(x)**  
   - **I** is absent.  
   - **S** is absent.  
   - Confirms **R**, **B**, and **E** in their correct positions (1, 3, 4).  

### Key Insights:
- **Secret word pattern**: `R _ B E _` (positions 2 and 5 are unknown).  
- **Absent letters**: A, C, D, I, N, O, S (cannot appear).  
- **Present letters with known positions**:  
  - **R** (position 1), **B** (position 3), **E** (position 4).  
- **Constraints for positions 2 and 5**:  
  - Must be letters **not** in the absent list (A, C, D, I, N, O, S).  
  - Cannot be **R**, **B**, or **E** (assuming no duplicates, as no feedback suggests duplicates).  
  - Position 5 cannot be **E** (from Guess 1 feedback).  
- **Possible letters for positions 2 and 5**: F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

### Candidate Words:
- The only common English word fitting `R _ B E _` with the constraints is **RUBEL** (a currency unit):  
  - **R** (pos1), **U** (pos2), **B** (pos3), **E** (pos4), **L** (pos5).  
- Other possibilities like ""RUBES"" or ""RIBES"" are invalid (S is absent). ""RUBLE"" does not fit (it requires E at position 5, which is invalid).  

### Strategy:
- **RUBEL** tests **U** (position 2) and **L** (position 5), both untested letters.  
- If correct, the game ends. If not, feedback on **U** and **L** will confirm/eliminate them, narrowing to other rare words (e.g., ""RUBY"" is 4 letters; ""RUMEN"" has absent N).",Guess 4: rubel -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) U(x) B(✓) E(✓) L(✓),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R is not the second letter, and E is not the fifth letter.
 - The letters C, A, N are not in the word at all.

 Since we have 6 tries, we can use this information to make a second guess.

 We need to choose a word that:
 1. Includes R and E (since they are in the secret word) but in different positions than in ""crane"".
    - R was in position 2, so in the new guess, R should not be in position 2? Actually, it can be in any position except that we know it's not the second? 
      But note: the feedback says R is in the word but not in position 2. So R must be in one of positions 1,3,4,5? Actually, no: the feedback only tells us about the position we guessed. 
      It doesn't prevent R from being in position 2? Wait, no: because if R were in position 2, it would have been marked as correct (✓). But it was marked as present but wrong position (-), so R is in the word but not at position 2.

 2. Does not include C, A, N.

 Also, we want to include other common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, H, etc.

 We know the word has 5 letters. We have two known letters: R and E.

 We can try to put R and E in positions that are not the ones we already tried (so R not at position 2, and E not at position 5).

 Also, we have three positions that were wrong: positions 1,3,4 (because we had C, A, N there and they are absent). But note: the feedback doesn't tell us about the positions of the absent letters, only that they are absent.

 So, for the next guess, we can try:

 Let me try to think of a word that has R and E, and three new letters.

 Example: ""ROUTE"" -> but we have O, U, T. However, note that we don't know if O, U, T are in the word. Also, we must avoid A and N? Actually, we know A and N are not in the word, so we can use other letters.

 But wait: we also know that the word does not have C, A, N. So we can use any letters except C, A, N.

 However, we must be cautious: we don't want to reuse letters that we know are absent? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we know they are not in the word. So we avoid C, A, N.

 Let me try to form a word:

 We have to place R and E. Since R was not at position 2, we can try R at position 1? But note: we don't know if position 1 is R or not. Similarly, E was not at position 5, so we can try E at position 1? But that might be unusual.

 Alternatively, we can try to put R at position 3 or 4 or 5? But note: in the first guess, position 5 was E and it was present but wrong, so E is not at position 5. But we don't know about position 1,3,4 for R.

 However, we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But the feedback doesn't indicate that, so we assume no duplicates for now.

 Let me think of words without C, A, N, and with R and E.

 Some possibilities: 
 - ""TRIED"": T, R, I, E, D -> but R is at position 2? We know R is not at position 2? Actually, we know from the first guess that R is not at position 2. But in this new word, if we put R at position 2, then we are repeating the same mistake? We know R is not at position 2, so we should avoid putting R at position 2.

 So in ""TRIED"", R is at position 2 -> that's the same position we already tried and it was wrong. So we should avoid that.

 How about ""RIDER""? But that has two R's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but typically in Wordle, duplicates are possible. However, the feedback for the first guess didn't show two R's? Actually, we only had one R. So if the word has two R's, then when we guessed ""crane"" (which has one R) we would have only gotten one R marked? But the feedback only marks the letters that are present. So if the word has two R's and we guess one, we get one R marked. So duplicates are possible.

 But to keep it simple, let's avoid duplicates for now.

 Another word: ""STREP"" -> but we have S, T, R, E, P. And R is at position 3? That's a new position. E is at position 4? Also, we avoid position 2 for R and position 5 for E? Actually, in ""STREP"":
   position 1: S
   position 2: T
   position 3: R -> that's okay because we haven't tried R at position 3? And we know R is not at position 2, but position 3 is new.
   position 4: E -> and we know E is not at position 5, but position 4 is new.
   position 5: P

 But note: we also have to check if S, T, P are in the word? We don't know. This guess will help us.

 However, we must make sure the word is valid. ""STREP"" is a valid word (meaning a type of bacteria).

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROGUE"": 
   R at position 1 (which is new for R) and E at position 5? But wait, we know E is not at position 5? Because in the first guess, we had E at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong. So if we put E at position 5 again, we know it's wrong? But we can do that to test? Actually, we can, but it might be inefficient.

 However, the feedback for E at position 5 was that it is present but not at that position. So if we put E at position 5 again, we will get the same feedback? That is, we won't get a check for E at position 5 because we know it's not there. So it's better to try E in a new position.

 Therefore, we should avoid putting E at position 5. Similarly, avoid R at position 2.

 So ""ROGUE"" has E at position 5 -> not good.

 How about ""DRIVE"": 
   D at 1, R at 2 -> but R at position 2 is the same as before? We know R is not at position 2, so we avoid that.

 How about ""PRICE"": but we know C is not in the word? So we cannot use C.

 How about ""TRIPE"": 
   T, R, I, P, E
   R at position 2 -> again, we know R is not at position 2? So we avoid.

 We need a word that has R not at position 2 and E not at position 5.

 Let me try: ""PERKY"" -> P, E, R, K, Y
   E at position 2? We don't know about position 2 for E? But we know E is in the word, but not at position 5. We don't know about other positions.
   R at position 3? That's new.

 But note: we also have to avoid A, C, N. This word doesn't have them.

 However, we have Y and K? They are less common, but okay.

 Alternatively, ""ROBES"": 
   R at 1, O, B, E at 4, S at 5 -> E is at position 4? That's new. And R at position 1? That's new.

 But we don't know if O, B, S are in the word.

 Another common word: ""STORE"": 
   S, T, O, R, E -> but R is at position 4? and E at position 5? We know E is not at position 5? So we avoid E at position 5.

 How about ""STOLE"": 
   S, T, O, L, E -> but we don't have R? We must include R because we know it's in the word.

 So we need a word that has R and E, and avoids C, A, N.

 Let me think: ""RIPER""? But that has two R's? And E at the end? We know E is not at position 5? So we avoid.

 How about ""RIPEN""? But we know N is not in the word? So we cannot use N.

 How about ""RIPED""? Not a common word? Actually, ""riped"" is not a standard word. We need valid words.

 Another idea: ""BREAD"" -> but we have A? We know A is not in the word? So we cannot use A.

 How about ""BREED""? But that has two E's? And we don't know if duplicates are there? Also, E at position 5? We know E is not at position 5? So avoid.

 How about ""BRUTE"": 
   B, R, U, T, E -> 
   R at position 2? We know R is not at position 2? So avoid.

 How about ""URGED"": 
   U, R, G, E, D -> 
   R at position 2? Again, same problem.

 How about ""TRIES"": 
   T, R, I, E, S -> 
   R at position 2? Avoid.

 How about ""RESIN"": but we know N is not in the word? So no.

 How about ""RESET"": 
   R, E, S, E, T -> has two E's? And we have E at position 2? We don't know if that's allowed? But also, we know E is in the word, but we don't know if there are two. 
   However, we also have E at position 5? We know E is not at position 5? So the second E at position 5 would be wrong? But we are trying to get information.

 But note: we are limited to 5 letters and we know the word has at least one R and one E. We don't know about duplicates.

 Alternatively, we can try ""RODEO""? But that has O and D? And no E? We need E.

 After some thought, I found: ""PRIED"": 
   P, R, I, E, D -> 
   R at position 2? Avoid.

 How about ""WROTE"": 
   W, R, O, T, E -> 
   R at position 2? Avoid.

 How about ""CRWTH""? Not common and we know C is not in the word.

 Another idea: ""EMPTY"" -> but no R? We must have R.

 How about ""RESTY"": 
   R, E, S, T, Y -> 
   R at position 1? That's new.
   E at position 2? We don't know about position 2 for E? It could be correct? 
   But note: we know R is in the word, but we don't know if it can be at position 1? We haven't tried position 1 for R.

 However, we also have to avoid the known absent letters: C, A, N. This word is okay.

 But wait: we have E at position 2? We don't have any information about E at position 2. It might be correct? Or it might be present but in the wrong position? We don't know.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROUSE"": 
   R, O, U, S, E -> 
   R at position 1? New.
   E at position 5? We know E is not at position 5? So we avoid.

 How about ""ROBED"": 
   R, O, B, E, D -> 
   R at 1, E at 4? That's new for E (previously we had E at 5, now at 4). So that's good.

 So ""ROBED"" seems acceptable.

 But let me check: 
   R at 1: we haven't tried that.
   O, B: new letters.
   E at 4: we haven't tried that.

 So we can use ""ROBED"".

 However, we might get more information if we use a word that has more common consonants? Like S, T, L.

 Another candidate: ""TRIBE"" -> but we have A? No, T, R, I, B, E -> 
   R at position 2? Avoid.

 How about ""STIRE""? Not a word.

 How about ""SERIF"": 
   S, E, R, I, F -> 
   E at position 2? 
   R at position 3? That's new.

 This word: ""SERIF"" is valid.

 But we have E at position 2? We don't know if that's correct? And R at position 3? We know R is in the word but not at position 2, so position 3 is a candidate.

 Also, we are testing S, E, R, I, F.

 Alternatively, ""RICES"" -> but we know C is not in the word? So no.

 After considering, I think ""ROBED"" is a valid choice, but let me see if we can do better.

 How about ""PRIDE"": 
   P, R, I, D, E -> 
   R at position 2? Avoid.

 How about ""DRIVE"": 
   D, R, I, V, E -> 
   R at position 2? Avoid.

 How about ""GRIME"": 
   G, R, I, M, E -> 
   R at position 2? Avoid.

 How about ""OPTER""? Not common.

 Another idea: ""REMIT"": 
   R, E, M, I, T -> 
   R at position 1? New.
   E at position 2? New.

 This is acceptable? But we have E at position 2? We don't know if that's correct? But we are testing.

 However, we are not repeating the same positions for R and E? R is at 1 (new) and E is at 2 (we haven't tried E at 2 before). 

 Also, we are testing M, I, T.

 But note: we know the word has R and E, so we are covering that.

 Alternatively, ""REBUS"": 
   R, E, B, U, S -> 
   R at 1, E at 2? Same as above.

 But we are testing B, U, S.

 I think ""REBUS"" is a valid word (meaning a puzzle).

 However, we are using E at position 2? We don't have any information that E is not at position 2? So it's okay.

 But we might get more information if we use a word that has the R and E in positions that are more likely to be correct? Actually, we don't know.

 Another common word: ""ADIEU"" -> but we know A is not in the word? So no.

 After careful thought, I choose ""ROBED"". 

 Why? 
 - It has R at position 1 (which we haven't tried) and E at position 4 (which is new, since we only know E is not at 5).
 - It avoids the letters C, A, N.
 - It uses new common letters: O, B, D.

 So, second guess: ""ROBED""

 Let me write it: 
   R at 1, O at 2, B at 3, E at 4, D at 5.

 We hope to get feedback on these.

 If the feedback shows:
   If R at 1 is correct, we get a check.
   If E at 4 is correct, we get a check.

 And we'll know about O, B, D.

 So, I'll go with ""ROBED"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and N are not in the word (marked ""x"").
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (marked ""-"").
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include R and E (since they are in the secret word), but avoid placing R in position 2 or E in position 5.
- Must exclude C, A, and N (since they are absent).
- Aim to test new common letters (e.g., B, O, D) and new positions for R and E.

The word ""ROBED"" fits these criteria:
- Places R in position 1 (new position, not tested before).
- Places E in position 4 (new position, avoiding position 5).
- Uses new letters: O, B, D (all untested).
- Excludes C, A, N.

This guess will help identify the positions of R and E while testing three new letters.

- B is correct at position 3 (so the third letter is B).
- E is correct at position 4 (so the fourth letter is E).
- D is not in the word.

Now, combining the information:
- The secret word starts with R, has B at position 3, and E at position 4. So the pattern so far is: R _ B E _
- Known absent letters: C, A, N, O, D (from the feedback above).
- Known present letters: R, B, E (with their exact positions known: R at 1, B at 3, E at 4).
- From the first guess, we also know that R is in the word (but now we know it's at position 1) and E is in the word (now at position 4).

Additionally, we know from the first guess that the secret word does not contain C, A, N, and from the second guess, it does not contain O and D.

Now, the missing letter is position 2 and position 5.

We need to find a 5-letter word that fits: R _ B E _

And the missing letters (position 2 and 5) must be letters that have not been ruled out. These letters cannot be C, A, N, O, D, and must be letters that we haven't tried or that are still possible.

Also, note that in the first guess, we had R and E in the word, but in different positions. Now we know their exact positions.

The word has the pattern: R _ B E _

We need to fill in the two blanks with letters that are not excluded (not C, A, N, O, D). We also have to consider that the entire word must be valid.

Possible letters for position 2 and 5: any letter except C, A, N, O, D. But we also haven't checked many letters yet.

Common remaining letters: F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we should choose a word that uses some of these and is valid.

The word must be: R?B?E? with the third letter B and fourth E. So the pattern is R (letter1) B E (letter2).

Possible words? Let's brainstorm:

- R I B E S? But that's 5 letters? ""RIBES"" is a word? Actually, it is a genus of plants. But let's see: positions: R at 1, I at 2, B at 3, E at 4, S at 5. So ""RIBES"".

But we don't know if I and S are allowed? We haven't ruled out I or S.

Other possibilities:
- R U B E S? ""RUBES"" is not common? It's plural of rube? But valid.
- R O B E S? But O is ruled out? We know O is absent. So not possible.
- R A B E S? But A is absent? No.
- R H Y M E? But that has Y and M? And H? But pattern: R at 1, H at 2? But then at 3 would be Y? But we need B at 3? Wait, no: we know position 3 is B. So the word must have B at position 3.

So fixed pattern: R ? B E ?

So four-letter pattern: R, ?, B, E, ?

Possible words? Let me list:

- ""RUBLE"": but L and E? Pattern: R, U, B, L, E? But position 4 is E? Wait, ""RUBLE"": R U B L E -> position 4 is L, but we need position 4 to be E? No, our pattern requires position 4 to be E. So ""RUBLE"" has E at 5? Not matching.

We must have E at position 4. So last letter is not E? Unless duplicated? But we don't know about duplicates.

Possible: 
- ""RIBES"" as I said: R I B E S -> matches pattern? 
  Position1: R
  Position2: I
  Position3: B
  Position4: E
  Position5: S

Yes, ""RIBES"" is a valid word.

- ""RUBES"": R U B E S -> 
  Position1: R
  Position2: U
  Position3: B
  Position4: E
  Position5: S

Also valid.

- ""RABES"" but R A B E S? A is absent? Not allowed.

- ""ROBES"": O absent? Not allowed.

- ""RUBEL""? R U B E L -> position 4 is E? But then L at 5? But that's 5 letters. ""RUBEL"" is a currency? But valid? Actually, it's R U B E L.

But in our pattern, we have R ? B E L? That would be R at1, ? at2, B at3, E at4, L at5. So ""RUBEL"" is R U B E L -> positions: 1:R, 2:U, 3:B, 4:E, 5:L.

So ""RUBEL"" is a possibility? But we don't know if U and L are allowed.

But we have two classes: RIBES, RUBES, RUBEL, etc.

But we also have ""RIPES"": R I P E S? But P is not at position 3? We need position 3 to be B! So not possible.

Similarly, ""RIFLE"": R I F L E -> position 3 is F? Not B.

With B at 3 and E at 4: 
- Other words: ""ROBED"" we already tried? But we know D is absent? Not the same.

Not many words have the pattern R?BES?

Actually, common words? ""RABID"" but A and D absent? And not matching pattern (position4 would be I?).

Another word: ""REBUS"" but that's R E B U S? Position1: R, position2: E? But we have E at position4? And if position2 is E? But we know the secret word has E at position4? That doesn't forbid E at other positions? However, in ""REBUS"", position2 is E? Also, position3 is B? So R E B U S? This might be a word? But in the pattern, our position2 is not fixed? Only that we know that E is at position4, but possibly it can be elsewhere?

But we know E is at position4? Does that mean it might be only at position4? Or could be duplicated? We don't know yet.

In the first guess, we had E at position5? And that was marked as present but wrong? And now in the second guess, E at position4 is marked correct? So E is at position4? It may or may not appear elsewhere.

Similarly, R? We have R at position1, but it could be elsewhere? However, in the first guess, we had R at position2? And that was marked as present? But now that R is fixed at position1, it could be that R is only at position1? Or duplicated? But no other information.

So, for the pattern: R at1, then a letter, then B at3, then E at4, then a letter.

Possibilities: 
- The last letter is the only one missing? And we need to choose one that is not excluded.

Common words: 
- ""RIBES"" (valid): letters I and S. 
- ""RUBES"" (valid): U and S.
- ""RUBEL"": U and L.
- ""JUMPS"" not matching.

Also, ""CABIN"" but C absent and not matching.

Other possibility: ""RBC"" wait no.

We need to test.

But note: we have only one missing position? Actually, two missing positions: position2 and position5.

We know the secret word is of the form: R ? B E ?

We need to fill the two blanks with letters that are not C, A, N, O, D.

Let's think: 
The set of allowed letters includes: F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we can try to guess a word that fills both blanks and is valid.

For example, ""RIPEN"" but N absent? No.

How about ""RIDES""? But we need B at position3? Position3 would be D? But we have B fixed at position3? So no.

Another idea: ""WRITE"" not matching.

Or ""LIVER"" not matching.

So limited options: 

- ""RIBES"" : I (position2), S (position5)
- ""RUBES"" : U (position2), S (position5)
- ""RUBEL"" : U (position2), L (position5)
- ""RABAT"" but not matching and A absent.
- ""ROBES"" but O absent.
- ""RUMBA"" but U, M, A? A absent? And position3 is B? Position4 is A? But we need E at position4? So not matching.
- ""CUBES"" but C absent.
- ""TUBES"" T at1? But we need R at1.

Only a few words match the pattern.

We can try ""RIBES"", but we are not sure.

However, we have more information: from the first guess, we had R and E. And now we have exact positions. But we need to confirm the missing letters.

But we are allowed to guess one of these.

Also, note: in the first guess, ""crane"" we had E at position5? And that was wrong? So the secret word does not have E at position5? So if we guess a word with E at position5? But that would be inconsistent? Actually, ""RIBES"" has S at position5? Not E? So that's okay.

Similarly, ""RUBES"" has S at position5? ""RUBEL"" has L at position5.

We don't have positive information about S or L? So they could be present?

We need to choose a word that tests common letters? Or we can use one of these.

Since we have three letters fixed: R, B, E? And we only have two positions unknown? We might guess correctly now.

But we have multiple options? ""RIBES"", ""RUBES"", ""RUBEL"", maybe ""RUBLE"" (variant of ROUBLE)?

""RUBLE"" is also a valid word: same as RUBEL? R U B L E.

We can choose one to test.

But note: we only have two positions: position2 and position5. So if we guess incorrectly, we get information? But we have limited tries.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses letters we haven't tried yet? To cover more possibilities.

For example, we might guess ""RISES""? But position3 is S? We need B? So no.

We cannot change positions1,3,4? Because they are fixed: R, B, E.

So any guess must have R at1, B at3, E at4? So the pattern is fixed: R ? B E ?

Therefore, we must guess with that pattern.

So we should choose a word that matches this pattern and uses letters that have not been excluded? And we haven't tried many letters? We only know C, A, N, O, D are absent? And we know R, B, E exact? So we need to fill the two blanks.

Possible words:

- ""RIBES"" : I in position2, S in position5
- ""RUBES"" : U in position2, S in position5
- ""RUBEL"" : U in position2, L in position5
- ""RUBLE"" : U in position2, E in position5? But E at position5? But we know from the first guess that E is not at position5? Because in ""crane"", position5 was E, marked as wrong position? Not necessarily that E cannot be at position5? Actually, the feedback was ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not at position5? So E cannot be at position5? Because if it were, it would be marked correct? But since it was marked as present but wrong position? So E is in the word, but at a position different from position5? And now we know it's at position4? So E cannot be duplicated at position5? Therefore, the secret word has E only at position4? So position5 cannot be E? Therefore, the word ""RUBLE"" would have E at position4 and E at position5? But because E is already placed at position4, if there is no duplicate, then position5 cannot be E? But we don't know for sure.

Let me clarify: the first guess ""crane"" had E at position5? And that E was marked as present but not at that position? So the secret word has at least one E and it is not at position5? The second guess ""robed"" had E at position4? It was marked correct? So now the secret word has E at position4? But if it has only one E, then position5 cannot be E? But if it has two E's, then position5 could be E? However, if there were two E's, then in the first guess, we would have seen only one E marked? But the feedback would be: when guessing a letter that appears twice? Actually, in Wordle, if you guess the same letter twice? Then if one instance is correct or present? It may show accordingly? But in this case, we did not guess two E's? So we don't know.

To be safe, we should avoid assuming duplicates? But it's possible.

But the pattern R?BES: R ? B E S? So ending with S is common? Like ""ribes"", ""rubes"", ""ruble"" ends with E? Which we think might not be possible? Because E at position5 is not allowed? But ""ruble"" has E at position5? Is that allowed? Wait, no: because we know from first guess that E is not at position5? So if we have a word with E at position5? Then if E is also at position4? Then it would be duplicated E? And that's possible? But the first guess ""crane"" had E at position5? And that was marked as present but wrong? So there is at least one E? And it's not at position5? If the secret word has E at position5? Then it would be a duplicate E? But the first guess would have shown E at position5 as present? Because the secret word has E at position5? So it should be marked as present? But the feedback was: for E at position5, it was marked as present but wrong? Wait, no: the rule: if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, mark as ""-"". But if the secret word has E at position5, then if we guess E at position5, it should be marked as ""✓"" (correct)? But in the first guess, it was ""-"", so it is not correct? Therefore, the secret word does not have E at position5? So if we have a word with E at position5? Then that E would be marked as ""x"" maybe? Or ""-""? Actually, if the secret word has E at position4, and we guess E at position5? Then it would show ""-"" for position5? But we know the secret word has E? So if we guess E at a position where it isn't? But it is in the word elsewhere? Then it shows ""-""? However, we already have E at position4? So if we guess E at position5? And the secret word does not have E at position5? Then it would be redundant? But the feedback would depend on whether there is another E? But we don't know if there is a second E.

But to avoid confusion, we should choose a word that does not use E at position5? Because we know the secret word has E at position4? And we don't want to duplicate? But if there is only one E, then we cannot have E at position5? So words like ""RUBLE"" (with E at5) would be invalid if there is only one E? But we don't know? So safer to avoid E at position5? Also, letters that are absent.

Therefore, possible words without E at the end? So ending with a non-E:

- ""RIBES"" : ends with S
- ""RUBES"" : ends with S
- ""RUBEL"" : ends with L? And does not have E? Wait, ""RUBEL"": R U B E L -> position5 is L? It does not have E at position5? Position5 is L? So it's okay.

Similarly, ""RUBLE"": same as RUBEL? R U B L E? Wait: that would be R at1, U at2, B at3, L at4? Then E at5? Oh no: position4 is L? But we need position4 to be E! So for ""RUBLE"", the spelling is usually R-U-B-L-E? So positions: 1:R, 2:U, 3:B, 4:L, 5:E? But we require position4 to be E? So actually, ""RUBLE"" does not match? Because position4 is L? Not E? So we cannot have ""RUBLE"" because it doesn't have E at position4?

We need position4 to be E? So words like ""RUBLE"" have E at position5? And position4 is L? So they don't fit our pattern of having E at position4.

Therefore, the only possibilities that have E at position4 are words ending with a different letter? Like:

- R I B E S : position4 is E? Yes, position4: E? Position5: S? So ""RIBES"".
- R U B E S : ""RUBES"".
- R U B E L : ""RUBEL""? But RUBEL is R U B E L? Then positions: 1:R, 2:U, 3:B, 4:E, 5:L? Yes, it has E at position4? So matches pattern.

Also? ""RABES"" but A absent? No.
""ROBES"" O absent.

So three words? ""RIBES"", ""RUBES"", ""RUBEL"".

We can choose one? But we don't know which one? And we have 5 tries left? Actually we have used 2, so 4 left? No, we have 6 tries? We used 2, so 4 remaining? But perhaps we can guess one? Or use a word that tests as much as possible.

But we have to guess a word that matches the pattern? So we have to pick one? 

We can try with a word that has letters we haven't tested? I and S? Or U and S? Or U and L? That hasn't been tested? 

Looking at the first guess, we tested C, R, A, N, E? And second guess: R, O, B, E, D? So we haven't tested S, I, U, L?

We can guess ""RIBES"" to test I and S? If it is not correct, we get feedback on I and S? Then we can narrow down? Similarly, ""RUBES"" tests U and S? Etc.

Among the options, ""RIBES"" contains I and S? Which are vowels and common? ""RUBES"" contains U and S? U is less common? So ""RIBES"" might be more typical? Or we could choose one.

But to make it arbitrary? I'll choose ""RIBES"".

Alternatively, to cover more ground? But note: the word must match the pattern? So if we guess ""RIBES"", and it is not correct? We might get:

- Position2: I? Marked as wrong? Or not present?
- Position5: S? Marked accordingly.

Then we can deduce.

Similarly for other guesses.

Therefore, I suggest guessing ""RIBES"".

After submitting ""RIBES"", we will receive feedback? And continue.

So next guess: ""RIBES""

Therefore, return <guess>ribes</guess>.Based on the feedback from the two previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)**  
  - This indicates that the secret word does not contain C, A, or N.
  - R is present but not in position 2.
  - E is present but not in position 5.

- **Guess 2: robed → Feedback: R(✓) O(x) B(✓) E(✓) D(x)**  
  - R is correct and in position 1 (so the word starts with R).
  - O is not in the word.
  - B is correct and in position 3 (so the third letter is B).
  - E is correct and in position 4 (so the fourth letter is E).
  - D is not in the word.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word pattern is **R _ B E _** (position 1: R, position 3: B, position 4: E).
- Positions 2 and 5 are unknown.
- Absent letters: **C, A, N, O, D** (cannot appear anywhere).
- Present letters with known positions: **R (pos1), B (pos3), E (pos4)**.
- From Guess 1, E is confirmed present (now at pos4) but not at pos5, so position 5 cannot be E.

### Optimization for Next Guess:
- The goal is to solve the word efficiently by testing plausible candidates for positions 2 and 5 while avoiding excluded letters.
- Only a few valid English words fit the pattern **R _ B E _**:
  - **RIBES** (meaning a genus of plants): Positions: R (1), I (2), B (3), E (4), S (5).
  - **RUBES** (plural of ""rube""): Positions: R (1), U (2), B (3), E (4), S (5).
  - **RUBEL** (variant spelling of ""rouble,"" a currency): Positions: R (1), U (2), B (3), E (4), L (5).
- Other combinations? Words like ""RABES"" or ""ROBES"" are invalid due to excluded A and O.
- **RIBES** is chosen here to test:
  - **I** (vowel, common) in position 2.
  - **S** (common consonant) in position 5.
- If incorrect, feedback on **I** and **S** will help confirm/eliminate **U** or **L** in future guesses.

<guess>ribes</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: robed -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) O(x) B(✓) E(✓) D(x)
Guess 3: ribes -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) I(x) B(✓) E(✓) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Meaning:
- C, A, N are absent.
- R is present but not in position 2.
- E is present but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""robed"" -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) O(x) B(✓) E(✓) D(x)
Meaning:
- R is correct at position 1.
- O is absent.
- B is correct at position 3.
- E is correct at position 4.
- D is absent.

Guess 3: ""ribes"" -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) I(x) B(✓) E(✓) S(x)
Meaning:
- R is correct at position 1 (already known).
- I is absent.
- B is correct at position 3 (already known).
- E is correct at position 4 (already known).
- S is absent.

Now, combining all information:

- The secret word starts with R, has B at position 3, and E at position 4. So the pattern is: R _ B E _
- Known absent letters: C, A, N, O, D, I, S (from the feedback: C, A, N from guess1; O, D from guess2; I, S from guess3).
- We also know that the word contains R, B, E (with fixed positions) and one more letter that we haven't identified? Actually, we know there are two missing letters: position 2 and position 5? But we have only one missing letter? No: the word has 5 letters, and we know positions 1,3,4: R, B, E. So positions 2 and 5 are unknown.

But we have ruled out many letters: C, A, N, O, D, I, S.

Also, from the first guess, we know that R and E are in the word (now fixed) and we have no indication of duplicates? So we assume no duplicates for now? But we cannot be sure.

The remaining letters for positions 2 and 5 must be from the letters not excluded.

Excluded letters: A, C, D, I, N, O, S.

So allowed letters: B, E, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, R, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: we already have B, E, R in the word? And if there are no duplicates, then we cannot use B, E, R again? But we are missing two letters? So we need two new letters? But we have R, B, E already? So the other two must be different? Unless duplicates? But we have no evidence of duplicates.

So we assume no duplicates? Then the letters for position 2 and 5 must be from: F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we also know that the word must be valid.

Now, the pattern: R ? B E ?

We need to fill position 2 and position 5 with two distinct letters from the allowed set? And not B, E, R? (if no duplicates).

Now, what words fit this pattern?

We had ""RUBES"" and ""RUBEL"" as possibilities? But ""RUBES"" has S? But S is absent? So ""RUBES"" is invalid? Because S is absent? Similarly, ""RIBES"" we tried and S is absent? So ""RUBES"" also has S? So invalid.

""RUBEL"": R U B E L -> position2: U, position5: L? But we haven't ruled out U and L? So it is possible.

Are there other words?

For example:
- ""RUBLE"": same as RUBEL? But spelling: R U B L E? Then position4 would be L? But we need position4 to be E? So no? ""RUBLE"" is R-U-B-L-E, so positions: 1:R, 2:U, 3:B, 4:L, 5:E? But we require position4 to be E? So it doesn't match.

""RUBEL"" is R-U-B-E-L? Then positions: 1:R, 2:U, 3:B, 4:E, 5:L? Yes, that matches.

Other words? 
- ""RABAT"" but A absent? No.
- ""ROBED"" we tried? D absent? And O absent? No.
- ""RUMBA"" but M? And A absent? And position4 is A? But we need E? No.
- ""CUBED"" but C and D absent? No.
- ""TUBER"" but T? But position1 is T? We need R? No.

How about ""RULER""? But that has R at the end? And two R's? But we have R at position1? So if we have ""RULER"": R U L E R? Then positions: 1:R, 2:U, 3:L, 4:E, 5:R? But we need position3 to be B? So not matching.

Another word: ""RUBY"" is 4 letters? No.

""RUBLE"": same as RUBEL? But RUBEL is an alternative spelling? Or ""ROUBLE""? But O absent? So RUBEL is acceptable.

But are there other words? For example, ""RUBEFY""? Too long.

""JUBE"" is 4 letters.

Perhaps ""RUBEL"" is the only common word? But let's think of more.

""RUBES"" is out because of S? And ""RIBES"" is out? So only ""RUBEL"" remains? But we have to check if U and L are allowed? We haven't ruled them out.

But we also have ""RUBLE""? But that's the same as RUBEL? Or ""ROUBLE"" with O? Absent.

Another possibility: ""RUBIN""? But N absent? And position4 would be I? But we need E? And I is absent? So no.

""RUBID""? But D absent? And position4 I? No.

So ""RUBEL"" seems a candidate.

But we need to confirm: is ""RUBEL"" a valid word? Yes, it is a variant of rouble, a currency unit.

But we have another candidate? What about ""RUMEN""? But M? And position4 E? But then N? But N is absent? So no.

""RUPEE"": R U P E E? But that has two E's? And position3 is P? Not B? So no.

""RUBIO"": O absent? And I? But I is absent? And O absent? No.

So the only candidate we have is ""RUBEL"".

But we must consider that the word might have duplicates? For example, if the secret word has two E's? But we have E at position4? And if position5 is E? But we know from the first guess that E is not at position5? So position5 cannot be E? Because if it were, the first guess would have shown E at position5 as correct? Or at least present? But it was present but not at position5? So if there were two E's, and one is at position4? Then position5 could be E? But then in the first guess, when we guessed E at position5? It would be marked as present? Because there is an E at position5? But it was marked as present? But the feedback for E was ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not at that position? So if the secret word had E at position5, then when we guess E at position5, it should be marked as correct (✓)? But it was not? It was marked as present but wrong position? So that means the secret word does not have E at position5? Therefore, position5 cannot be E? So no duplicate E at position5.

Similarly, for other letters? We have no indication of duplicates? So we assume no duplicates? Then the secret word has exactly the letters R, B, E, and two others? Which are not excluded? And not R, B, E.

Therefore, we can guess ""RUBEL"".

But we have to make sure? We have not tested U and L? So if we guess ""RUBEL"", we might get:

- If correct, we win.
- If not, we get feedback on U and L? Then we can adjust.

But since we have only one candidate? We can try.

Alternatively, are there other words? 

What about ""RUBEY""? Not a word.

""RUBED""? D absent? And E at position4? But D absent.

""RUBEX""? Not common? And X? But we can check? ""RUBEX"" is not a standard word? 

""RUBIS""? But S absent? And I absent? No.

So I think ""RUBEL"" is the only common word.

Therefore, we guess ""RUBEL"".

So next guess: ""RUBEL""

  - Cannot be **R**, **B**, or **E** (assuming no duplicates, as no feedback suggests duplicates).  
  - Position 5 cannot be **E** (from Guess 1 feedback).  
- **Possible letters for positions 2 and 5**: F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

### Candidate Words:
- The only common English word fitting `R _ B E _` with the constraints is **RUBEL** (a currency unit):  
  - **R** (pos1), **U** (pos2), **B** (pos3), **E** (pos4), **L** (pos5).  
- Other possibilities like ""RUBES"" or ""RIBES"" are invalid (S is absent). ""RUBLE"" does not fit (it requires E at position 5, which is invalid).  

### Strategy:
- **RUBEL** tests **U** (position 2) and **L** (position 5), both untested letters.  
- If correct, the game ends. If not, feedback on **U** and **L** will confirm/eliminate them, narrowing to other rare words (e.g., ""RUBY"" is 4 letters; ""RUMEN"" has absent N).

Includes R and E (since they are in the secret word) but in different positions than in ""crane"".\n    - R was in position 2, so in the new guess, R should not be in position 2? Actually, it can be in any position except that we know it\'s not the second? \n      But note: the feedback says R is in the word but not in position 2. So R must be in one of positions 1,3,4,5? Actually, no: the feedback only tells us about the position we guessed. \n      It doesn\'t prevent R from being in position 2? Wait, no: because if R were in position 2, it would have been marked as correct (✓). But it was marked as present but wrong position (-), so R is in the word but not at position 2.\n\n 2. Does not include C, A, N.\n\n Also, we want to include other common letters to get more information.\n\n Let\'s think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N.\n\n Common letters we haven\'t tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, H, etc.\n\n We know the word has 5 letters. We have two known letters: R and E.\n\n We can try to put R and E in positions that are not the ones we already tried (so R not at position 2, and E not at position 5).\n\n Also, we have three positions that were wrong: positions 1,3,4 (because we had C, A, N there and they are absent). But note: the feedback doesn\'t tell us about the positions of the absent letters, only that they are absent.\n\n So, for the next guess, we can try:\n\n Let me try to think of a word that has R and E, and three new letters.\n\n Example: ""ROUTE"" -> but we have O, U, T. However, note that we don\'t know if O, U, T are in the word. Also, we must avoid A and N? Actually, we know A and N are not in the word, so we can use other letters.\n\n But wait: we also know that the word does not have C, A, N. So we can use any letters except C, A, N.\n\n However, we must be cautious: we don\'t want to reuse letters that we know are absent? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we know they are not in the word. So we avoid C, A, N.\n\n Let me try to form a word:\n\n We have to place R and E. Since R was not at position 2, we can try R at position 1? But note: we don\'t know if position 1 is R or not. Similarly, E was not at position 5, so we can try E at position 1? But that might be unusual.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to put R at position 3 or 4 or 5? But note: in the first guess, position 5 was E and it was present but wrong, so E is not at position 5. But we don\'t know about position 1,3,4 for R.\n\n However, we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But the feedback doesn\'t indicate that, so we assume no duplicates for now.\n\n Let me think of words without C, A, N, and with R and E.\n\n Some possibilities: \n - ""TRIED"": T, R, I, E, D -> but R is at position 2? We know R is not at position 2? Actually, we know from the first guess that R is not at position 2. But in this new word, if we put R at position 2, then we are repeating the same mistake? We know R is not at position 2, so we should avoid putting R at position 2.\n\n So in ""TRIED"", R is at position 2 -> that\'s the same position we already tried and it was wrong. So we should avoid that.\n\n How about ""RIDER""? But that has two R\'s? We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed, but typically in Wordle, duplicates are possible. However, the feedback for the first guess didn\'t show two R\'s? Actually, we only had one R. So if the word has two R\'s, then when we guessed ""crane"" (which has one R) we would have only gotten one R marked? But the feedback only marks the letters that are present. So if the word has two R\'s and we guess one, we get one R marked. So duplicates are possible.\n\n But to keep it simple, let\'s avoid duplicates for now.\n\n Another word: ""STREP"" -> but we have S, T, R, E, P. And R is at position 3? That\'s a new position. E is at position 4? Also, we avoid position 2 for R and position 5 for E? Actually, in ""STREP"":\n   position 1: S\n   position 2: T\n   position 3: R -> that\'s okay because we haven\'t tried R at position 3? And we know R is not at position 2, but position 3 is new.\n   position 4: E -> and we know E is not at position 5, but position 4 is new.\n   position 5: P\n\n But note: we also have to check if S, T, P are in the word? We don\'t know. This guess will help us.\n\n However, we must make sure the word is valid. ""STREP"" is a valid word (meaning a type of bacteria).\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""ROGUE"": \n   R at position 1 (which is new for R) and E at position 5? But wait, we know E is not at position 5? Because in the first guess, we had E at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong. So if we put E at position 5 again, we know it\'s wrong? But we can do that to test? Actually, we can, but it might be inefficient.\n\n However, the feedback for E at position 5 was that it is present but not at that position. So if we put E at position 5 again, we will get the same feedback? That is, we won\'t get a check for E at position 5 because we know it\'s not there. So it\'s better to try E in a new position.\n\n Therefore, we should avoid putting E at position 5. Similarly, avoid R at position 2.\n\n So ""ROGUE"" has E at position 5 -> not good.\n\n How about ""DRIVE"": \n   D at 1, R at 2 -> but R at position 2 is the same as before? We know R is not at position 2, so we avoid that.\n\n How about ""PRICE"": but we know C is not in the word? So we cannot use C.\n\n How about ""TRIPE"": \n   T, R, I, P, E\n   R at position 2 -> again, we know R is not at position 2? So we avoid.\n\n We need a word that has R not at position 2 and E not at position 5.\n\n Let me try: ""PERKY"" -> P, E, R, K, Y\n   E at position 2? We don\'t know about position 2 for E? But we know E is in the word, but not at position 5. We don\'t know about other positions.\n   R at position 3? That\'s new.\n\n But note: we also have to avoid A, C, N. This word doesn\'t have them.\n\n However, we have Y and K? They are less common, but okay.\n\n Alternatively, ""ROBES"": \n   R at 1, O, B, E at 4, S at 5 -> E is at position 4? That\'s new. And R at position 1? That\'s new.\n\n But we don\'t know if O, B, S are in the word.\n\n Another common word: ""STORE"": \n   S, T, O, R, E -> but R is at position 4? and E at position 5? We know E is not at position 5? So we avoid E at position 5.\n\n How about ""STOLE"": \n   S, T, O, L, E -> but we don\'t have R? We must include R because we know it\'s in the word.\n\n So we need a word that has R and E, and avoids C, A, N.\n\n Let me think: ""RIPER""? But that has two R\'s? And E at the end? We know E is not at position 5? So we avoid.\n\n How about ""RIPEN""? But we know N is not in the word? So we cannot use N.\n\n How about ""RIPED""? Not a common word? Actually, ""riped"" is not a standard word. We need valid words.\n\n Another idea: ""BREAD"" -> but we have A? We know A is not in the word? So we cannot use A.\n\n How about ""BREED""? But that has two E\'s? And we don\'t know if duplicates are there? Also, E at position 5? We know E is not at position 5? So avoid.\n\n How about ""BRUTE"": \n   B, R, U, T, E -> \n   R at position 2? We know R is not at position 2? So avoid.\n\n How about ""URGED"": \n   U, R, G, E, D -> \n   R at position 2? Again, same problem.\n\n How about ""TRIES"": \n   T, R, I, E, S -> \n   R at position 2? Avoid.\n\n How about ""RESIN"": but we know N is not in the word? So no.\n\n How about ""RESET"": \n   R, E, S, E, T -> has two E\'s? And we have E at position 2? We don\'t know if that\'s allowed? But also, we know E is in the word, but we don\'t know if there are two. \n   However, we also have E at position 5? We know E is not at position 5? So the second E at position 5 would be wrong? But we are trying to get information.\n\n But note: we are limited to 5 letters and we know the word has at least one R and one E. We don\'t know about duplicates.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""RODEO""? But that has O and D? And no E? We need E.\n\n After some thought, I found: ""PRIED"": \n   P, R, I, E, D -> \n   R at position 2? Avoid.\n\n How about ""WROTE"": \n   W, R, O, T, E -> \n   R at position 2? Avoid.\n\n How about ""CRWTH""? Not common and we know C is not in the word.\n\n Another idea: ""EMPTY"" -> but no R? We must have R.\n\n How about ""RESTY"": \n   R, E, S, T, Y -> \n   R at position 1? That\'s new.\n   E at position 2? We don\'t know about position 2 for E? It could be correct? \n   But note: we know R is in the word, but we don\'t know if it can be at position 1? We haven\'t tried position 1 for R.\n\n However, we also have to avoid the known absent letters: C, A, N. This word is okay.\n\n But wait: we have E at position 2? We don\'t have any information about E at position 2. It might be correct? Or it might be present but in the wrong position? We don\'t know.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""ROUSE"": \n   R, O, U, S, E -> \n   R at position 1? New.\n   E at position 5? We know E is not at position 5? So we avoid.\n\n How about ""ROBED"": \n   R, O, B, E, D -> \n   R at 1, E at 4? That\'s new for E (previously we had E at 5, now at 4). So that\'s good.\n\n So ""ROBED"" seems acceptable.\n\n But let me check: \n   R at 1: we haven\'t tried that.\n   O, B: new letters.\n   E at 4: we haven\'t tried that.\n\n So we can use ""ROBED"".\n\n However, we might get more information if we use a word that has more common consonants? Like S, T, L.\n\n Another candidate: ""TRIBE"" -> but we have A? No, T, R, I, B, E -> \n   R at position 2? Avoid.\n\n How about ""STIRE""? Not a word.\n\n How about ""SERIF"": \n   S, E, R, I, F -> \n   E at position 2? \n   R at position 3? That\'s new.\n\n This word: ""SERIF"" is valid.\n\n But we have E at position 2? We don\'t know if that\'s correct? And R at position 3? We know R is in the word but not at position 2, so position 3 is a candidate.\n\n Also, we are testing S, E, R, I, F.\n\n Alternatively, ""RICES"" -> but we know C is not in the word? So no.\n\n After considering, I think ""ROBED"" is a valid choice, but let me see if we can do better.\n\n How about ""PRIDE"": \n   P, R, I, D, E -> \n   R at position 2? Avoid.\n\n How about ""DRIVE"": \n   D, R, I, V, E -> \n   R at position 2? Avoid.\n\n How about ""GRIME"": \n   G, R, I, M, E -> \n   R at position 2? Avoid.\n\n How about ""OPTER""? Not common.\n\n Another idea: ""REMIT"": \n   R, E, M, I, T -> \n   R at position 1? New.\n   E at position 2? New.\n\n This is acceptable? But we have E at position 2? We don\'t know if that\'s correct? But we are testing.\n\n However, we are not repeating the same positions for R and E? R is at 1 (new) and E is at 2 (we haven\'t tried E at 2 before). \n\n Also, we are testing M, I, T.\n\n But note: we know the word has R and E, so we are covering that.\n\n Alternatively, ""REBUS"": \n   R, E, B, U, S -> \n   R at 1, E at 2? Same as above.\n\n But we are testing B, U, S.\n\n I think ""REBUS"" is a valid word (meaning a puzzle).\n\n However, we are using E at position 2? We don\'t have any information that E is not at position 2? So it\'s okay.\n\n But we might get more information if we use a word that has the R and E in positions that are more likely to be correct? Actually, we don\'t know.\n\n Another common word: ""ADIEU"" -> but we know A is not in the word? So no.\n\n After careful thought, I choose ""ROBED"". \n\n Why? \n - It has R at position 1 (which we haven\'t tried) and E at position 4 (which is new, since we only know E is not at 5).\n - It avoids the letters C, A, N.\n - It uses new common letters: O, B, D.\n\n So, second guess: ""ROBED""\n\n Let me write it: \n   R at 1, O at 2, B at 3, E at 4, D at 5.\n\n We hope to get feedback on these.\n\n If the feedback shows:\n   If R at 1 is correct, we get a check.\n   If E at 4 is correct, we get a check.\n\n And we\'ll know about O, B, D.\n\n So, I\'ll go with ""ROBED"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, A, and N are not in the word (marked ""x"").\n- R is in the word but not in position 2 (marked ""-"").\n- E is in the word but not in position 5 (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include R and E (since they are in the secret word), but avoid placing R in position 2 or E in position 5.\n- Must exclude C, A, and N (since they are absent).\n- Aim to test new common letters (e.g., B, O, D) and new positions for R and E.\n\nThe word ""ROBED"" fits these criteria:\n- Places R in position 1 (new position, not tested before).\n- Places E in position 4 (new position, avoiding position 5).\n- Uses new letters: O, B, D (all untested).\n- Excludes C, A, N.\n\nThis guess will help identify the positions of R and E while testing three new letters.\n\n<guess>robed</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: robed -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) O(x) B(✓) E(✓) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nMeaning:\n- C, A, N are not in the word.\n- R is in the word but not at position 2.\n- E is in the word but not at position 5.\n\nGuess 2: ""robed"" -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) O(x) B(✓) E(✓) D(x)\nMeaning:\n- R is correct at position 1 (so the secret word starts with R).\n- O is not in the word.\n- B is correct at position 3 (so the third letter is B).\n- E is correct at position 4 (so the fourth letter is E).\n- D is not in the word.\n\nNow, combining the information:\n- The secret word starts with R, has B at position 3, and E at position 4. So the pattern so far is: R _ B E _\n- Known absent letters: C, A, N, O, D (from the feedback above).\n- Known present letters: R, B, E (with their exact positions known: R at 1, B at 3, E at 4).\n- From the first guess, we also know that R is in the word (but now we know it\'s at position 1) and E is in the word (now at position 4).\n\nAdditionally, we know from the first guess that the secret word does not contain C, A, N, and from the second guess, it does not contain O and D.\n\nNow, the missing letter is position 2 and position 5.\n\nWe need to find a 5-letter word that fits: R _ B E _\n\nAnd the missing letters (position 2 and 5) must be letters that have not been ruled out. These letters cannot be C, A, N, O, D, and must be letters that we haven\'t tried or that are still possible.\n\nAlso, note that in the first guess, we had R and E in the word, but in different positions. Now we know their exact positions.\n\nThe word has the pattern: R _ B E _\n\nWe need to fill in the two blanks with letters that are not excluded (not C, A, N, O, D). We also have to consider that the entire word must be valid.\n\nPossible letters for position 2 and 5: any letter except C, A, N, O, D. But we also haven\'t checked many letters yet.\n\nCommon remaining letters: F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we should choose a word that uses some of these and is valid.\n\nThe word must be: R?B?E? with the third letter B and fourth E. So the pattern is R (letter1) B E (letter2).\n\nPossible words? Let\'s brainstorm:\n\n- R I B E S? But that\'s 5 letters? ""RIBES"" is a word? Actually, it is a genus of plants. But let\'s see: positions: R at 1, I at 2, B at 3, E at 4, S at 5. So ""RIBES"".\n\nBut we don\'t know if I and S are allowed? We haven\'t ruled out I or S.\n\nOther possibilities:\n- R U B E S? ""RUBES"" is not common? It\'s plural of rube? But valid.\n- R O B E S? But O is ruled out? We know O is absent. So not possible.\n- R A B E S? But A is absent? No.\n- R H Y M E? But that has Y and M? And H? But pattern: R at 1, H at 2? But then at 3 would be Y? But we need B at 3? Wait, no: we know position 3 is B. So the word must have B at position 3.\n\nSo fixed pattern: R ? B E ?\n\nSo four-letter pattern: R, ?, B, E, ?\n\nPossible words? Let me list:\n\n- ""RUBLE"": but L and E? Pattern: R, U, B, L, E? But position 4 is E? Wait, ""RUBLE"": R U B L E -> position 4 is L, but we need position 4 to be E? No, our pattern requires position 4 to be E. So ""RUBLE"" has E at 5? Not matching.\n\nWe must have E at position 4. So last letter is not E? Unless duplicated? But we don\'t know about duplicates.\n\nPossible: \n- ""RIBES"" as I said: R I B E S -> matches pattern? \n  Position1: R\n  Position2: I\n  Position3: B\n  Position4: E\n  Position5: S\n\nYes, ""RIBES"" is a valid word.\n\n- ""RUBES"": R U B E S -> \n  Position1: R\n  Position2: U\n  Position3: B\n  Position4: E\n  Position5: S\n\nAlso valid.\n\n- ""RABES"" but R A B E S? A is absent? Not allowed.\n\n- ""ROBES"": O absent? Not allowed.\n\n- ""RUBEL""? R U B E L -> position 4 is E? But then L at 5? But that\'s 5 letters. ""RUBEL"" is a currency? But valid? Actually, it\'s R U B E L.\n\nBut in our pattern, we have R ? B E L? That would be R at1, ? at2, B at3, E at4, L at5. So ""RUBEL"" is R U B E L -> positions: 1:R, 2:U, 3:B, 4:E, 5:L.\n\nSo ""RUBEL"" is a possibility? But we don\'t know if U and L are allowed.\n\nBut we have two classes: RIBES, RUBES, RUBEL, etc.\n\nBut we also have ""RIPES"": R I P E S? But P is not at position 3? We need position 3 to be B! So not possible.\n\nSimilarly, ""RIFLE"": R I F L E -> position 3 is F? Not B.\n\nWith B at 3 and E at 4: \n- Other words: ""ROBED"" we already tried? But we know D is absent? Not the same.\n\nNot many words have the pattern R?BES?\n\nActually, common words? ""RABID"" but A and D absent? And not matching pattern (position4 would be I?).\n\nAnother word: ""REBUS"" but that\'s R E B U S? Position1: R, position2: E? But we have E at position4? And if position2 is E? But we know the secret word has E at position4? That doesn\'t forbid E at other positions? However, in ""REBUS"", position2 is E? Also, position3 is B? So R E B U S? This might be a word? But in the pattern, our position2 is not fixed? Only that we know that E is at position4, but possibly it can be elsewhere?\n\nBut we know E is at position4? Does that mean it might be only at position4? Or could be duplicated? We don\'t know yet.\n\nIn the first guess, we had E at position5? And that was marked as present but wrong? And now in the second guess, E at position4 is marked correct? So E is at position4? It may or may not appear elsewhere.\n\nSimilarly, R? We have R at position1, but it could be elsewhere? However, in the first guess, we had R at position2? And that was marked as present? But now that R is fixed at position1, it could be that R is only at position1? Or duplicated? But no other information.\n\nSo, for the pattern: R at1, then a letter, then B at3, then E at4, then a letter.\n\nPossibilities: \n- The last letter is the only one missing? And we need to choose one that is not excluded.\n\nCommon words: \n- ""RIBES"" (valid): letters I and S. \n- ""RUBES"" (valid): U and S.\n- ""RUBEL"": U and L.\n- ""JUMPS"" not matching.\n\nAlso, ""CABIN"" but C absent and not matching.\n\nOther possibility: ""RBC"" wait no.\n\nWe need to test.\n\nBut note: we have only one missing position? Actually, two missing positions: position2 and position5.\n\nWe know the secret word is of the form: R ? B E ?\n\nWe need to fill the two blanks with letters that are not C, A, N, O, D.\n\nLet\'s think: \nThe set of allowed letters includes: F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we can try to guess a word that fills both blanks and is valid.\n\nFor example, ""RIPEN"" but N absent? No.\n\nHow about ""RIDES""? But we need B at position3? Position3 would be D? But we have B fixed at position3? So no.\n\nAnother idea: ""WRITE"" not matching.\n\nOr ""LIVER"" not matching.\n\nSo limited options: \n\n- ""RIBES"" : I (position2), S (position5)\n- ""RUBES"" : U (position2), S (position5)\n- ""RUBEL"" : U (position2), L (position5)\n- ""RABAT"" but not matching and A absent.\n- ""ROBES"" but O absent.\n- ""RUMBA"" but U, M, A? A absent? And position3 is B? Position4 is A? But we need E at position4? So not matching.\n- ""CUBES"" but C absent.\n- ""TUBES"" T at1? But we need R at1.\n\nOnly a few words match the pattern.\n\nWe can try ""RIBES"", but we are not sure.\n\nHowever, we have more information: from the first guess, we had R and E. And now we have exact positions. But we need to confirm the missing letters.\n\nBut we are allowed to guess one of these.\n\nAlso, note: in the first guess, ""crane"" we had E at position5? And that was wrong? So the secret word does not have E at position5? So if we guess a word with E at position5? But that would be inconsistent? Actually, ""RIBES"" has S at position5? Not E? So that\'s okay.\n\nSimilarly, ""RUBES"" has S at position5? ""RUBEL"" has L at position5.\n\nWe don\'t have positive information about S or L? So they could be present?\n\nWe need to choose a word that tests common letters? Or we can use one of these.\n\nSince we have three letters fixed: R, B, E? And we only have two positions unknown? We might guess correctly now.\n\nBut we have multiple options? ""RIBES"", ""RUBES"", ""RUBEL"", maybe ""RUBLE"" (variant of ROUBLE)?\n\n""RUBLE"" is also a valid word: same as RUBEL? R U B L E.\n\nWe can choose one to test.\n\nBut note: we only have two positions: position2 and position5. So if we guess incorrectly, we get information? But we have limited tries.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that uses letters we haven\'t tried yet? To cover more possibilities.\n\nFor example, we might guess ""RISES""? But position3 is S? We need B? So no.\n\nWe cannot change positions1,3,4? Because they are fixed: R, B, E.\n\nSo any guess must have R at1, B at3, E at4? So the pattern is fixed: R ? B E ?\n\nTherefore, we must guess with that pattern.\n\nSo we should choose a word that matches this pattern and uses letters that have not been excluded? And we haven\'t tried many letters? We only know C, A, N, O, D are absent? And we know R, B, E exact? So we need to fill the two blanks.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""RIBES"" : I in position2, S in position5\n- ""RUBES"" : U in position2, S in position5\n- ""RUBEL"" : U in position2, L in position5\n- ""RUBLE"" : U in position2, E in position5? But E at position5? But we know from the first guess that E is not at position5? Because in ""crane"", position5 was E, marked as wrong position? Not necessarily that E cannot be at position5? Actually, the feedback was ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not at position5? So E cannot be at position5? Because if it were, it would be marked correct? But since it was marked as present but wrong position? So E is in the word, but at a position different from position5? And now we know it\'s at position4? So E cannot be duplicated at position5? Therefore, the secret word has E only at position4? So position5 cannot be E? Therefore, the word ""RUBLE"" would have E at position4 and E at position5? But because E is already placed at position4, if there is no duplicate, then position5 cannot be E? But we don\'t know for sure.\n\nLet me clarify: the first guess ""crane"" had E at position5? And that E was marked as present but not at that position? So the secret word has at least one E and it is not at position5? The second guess ""robed"" had E at position4? It was marked correct? So now the secret word has E at position4? But if it has only one E, then position5 cannot be E? But if it has two E\'s, then position5 could be E? However, if there were two E\'s, then in the first guess, we would have seen only one E marked? But the feedback would be: when guessing a letter that appears twice? Actually, in Wordle, if you guess the same letter twice? Then if one instance is correct or present? It may show accordingly? But in this case, we did not guess two E\'s? So we don\'t know.\n\nTo be safe, we should avoid assuming duplicates? But it\'s possible.\n\nBut the pattern R?BES: R ? B E S? So ending with S is common? Like ""ribes"", ""rubes"", ""ruble"" ends with E? Which we think might not be possible? Because E at position5 is not allowed? But ""ruble"" has E at position5? Is that allowed? Wait, no: because we know from first guess that E is not at position5? So if we have a word with E at position5? Then if E is also at position4? Then it would be duplicated E? And that\'s possible? But the first guess ""crane"" had E at position5? And that was marked as present but wrong? So there is at least one E? And it\'s not at position5? If the secret word has E at position5? Then it would be a duplicate E? But the first guess would have shown E at position5 as present? Because the secret word has E at position5? So it should be marked as present? But the feedback was: for E at position5, it was marked as present but wrong? Wait, no: the rule: if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, mark as ""-"". But if the secret word has E at position5, then if we guess E at position5, it should be marked as ""✓"" (correct)? But in the first guess, it was ""-"", so it is not correct? Therefore, the secret word does not have E at position5? So if we have a word with E at position5? Then that E would be marked as ""x"" maybe? Or ""-""? Actually, if the secret word has E at position4, and we guess E at position5? Then it would show ""-"" for position5? But we know the secret word has E? So if we guess E at a position where it isn\'t? But it is in the word elsewhere? Then it shows ""-""? However, we already have E at position4? So if we guess E at position5? And the secret word does not have E at position5? Then it would be redundant? But the feedback would depend on whether there is another E? But we don\'t know if there is a second E.\n\nBut to avoid confusion, we should choose a word that does not use E at position5? Because we know the secret word has E at position4? And we don\'t want to duplicate? But if there is only one E, then we cannot have E at position5? So words like ""RUBLE"" (with E at5) would be invalid if there is only one E? But we don\'t know? So safer to avoid E at position5? Also, letters that are absent.\n\nTherefore, possible words without E at the end? So ending with a non-E:\n\n- ""RIBES"" : ends with S\n- ""RUBES"" : ends with S\n- ""RUBEL"" : ends with L? And does not have E? Wait, ""RUBEL"": R U B E L -> position5 is L? It does not have E at position5? Position5 is L? So it\'s okay.\n\nSimilarly, ""RUBLE"": same as RUBEL? R U B L E? Wait: that would be R at1, U at2, B at3, L at4? Then E at5? Oh no: position4 is L? But we need position4 to be E! So for ""RUBLE"", the spelling is usually R-U-B-L-E? So positions: 1:R, 2:U, 3:B, 4:L, 5:E? But we require position4 to be E? So actually, ""RUBLE"" does not match? Because position4 is L? Not E? So we cannot have ""RUBLE"" because it doesn\'t have E at position4?\n\nWe need position4 to be E? So words like ""RUBLE"" have E at position5? And position4 is L? So they don\'t fit our pattern of having E at position4.\n\nTherefore, the only possibilities that have E at position4 are words ending with a different letter? Like:\n\n- R I B E S : position4 is E? Yes, position4: E? Position5: S? So ""RIBES"".\n- R U B E S : ""RUBES"".\n- R U B E L : ""RUBEL""? But RUBEL is R U B E L? Then positions: 1:R, 2:U, 3:B, 4:E, 5:L? Yes, it has E at position4? So matches pattern.\n\nAlso? ""RABES"" but A absent? No.\n""ROBES"" O absent.\n\nSo three words? ""RIBES"", ""RUBES"", ""RUBEL"".\n\nWe can choose one? But we don\'t know which one? And we have 5 tries left? Actually we have used 2, so 4 left? No, we have 6 tries? We used 2, so 4 remaining? But perhaps we can guess one? Or use a word that tests as much as possible.\n\nBut we have to guess a word that matches the pattern? So we have to pick one? \n\nWe can try with a word that has letters we haven\'t tested? I and S? Or U and S? Or U and L? That hasn\'t been tested? \n\nLooking at the first guess, we tested C, R, A, N, E? And second guess: R, O, B, E, D? So we haven\'t tested S, I, U, L?\n\nWe can guess ""RIBES"" to test I and S? If it is not correct, we get feedback on I and S? Then we can narrow down? Similarly, ""RUBES"" tests U and S? Etc.\n\nAmong the options, ""RIBES"" contains I and S? Which are vowels and common? ""RUBES"" contains U and S? U is less common? So ""RIBES"" might be more typical? Or we could choose one.\n\nBut to make it arbitrary? I\'ll choose ""RIBES"".\n\nAlternatively, to cover more ground? But note: the word must match the pattern? So if we guess ""RIBES"", and it is not correct? We might get:\n\n- Position2: I? Marked as wrong? Or not present?\n- Position5: S? Marked accordingly.\n\nThen we can deduce.\n\nSimilarly for other guesses.\n\nTherefore, I suggest guessing ""RIBES"".\n\nAfter submitting ""RIBES"", we will receive feedback? And continue.\n\nSo next guess: ""RIBES""\n\nTherefore, return <guess>ribes</guess>.Based on the feedback from the two previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: crane → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)**  \n  - This indicates that the secret word does not contain C, A, or N.\n  - R is present but not in position 2.\n  - E is present but not in position 5.\n\n- **Guess 2: robed → Feedback: R(✓) O(x) B(✓) E(✓) D(x)**  \n  - R is correct and in position 1 (so the word starts with R).\n  - O is not in the word.\n  - B is correct and in position 3 (so the third letter is B).\n  - E is correct and in position 4 (so the fourth letter is E).\n  - D is not in the word.\n\n### Key Insights:\n- The secret word pattern is **R _ B E _** (position 1: R, position 3: B, position 4: E).\n- Positions 2 and 5 are unknown.\n- Absent letters: **C, A, N, O, D** (cannot appear anywhere).\n- Present letters with known positions: **R (pos1), B (pos3), E (pos4)**.\n- From Guess 1, E is confirmed present (now at pos4) but not at pos5, so position 5 cannot be E.\n\n### Optimization for Next Guess:\n- The goal is to solve the word efficiently by testing plausible candidates for positions 2 and 5 while avoiding excluded letters.\n- Only a few valid English words fit the pattern **R _ B E _**:\n  - **RIBES** (meaning a genus of plants): Positions: R (1), I (2), B (3), E (4), S (5).\n  - **RUBES** (plural of ""rube""): Positions: R (1), U (2), B (3), E (4), S (5).\n  - **RUBEL** (variant spelling of ""rouble,"" a currency): Positions: R (1), U (2), B (3), E (4), L (5).\n- Other combinations? Words like ""RABES"" or ""ROBES"" are invalid due to excluded A and O.\n- **RIBES** is chosen here to test:\n  - **I** (vowel, common) in position 2.\n  - **S** (common consonant) in position 5.\n- If incorrect, feedback on **I** and **S** will help confirm/eliminate **U** or **L** in future guesses.\n\n<guess>ribes</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: robed -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) O(x) B(✓) E(✓) D(x)\nGuess 3: ribes -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) I(x) B(✓) E(✓) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nMeaning:\n- C, A, N are absent.\n- R is present but not in position 2.\n- E is present but not in position 5.\n\nGuess 2: ""robed"" -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) O(x) B(✓) E(✓) D(x)\nMeaning:\n- R is correct at position 1.\n- O is absent.\n- B is correct at position 3.\n- E is correct at position 4.\n- D is absent.\n\nGuess 3: ""ribes"" -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) I(x) B(✓) E(✓) S(x)\nMeaning:\n- R is correct at position 1 (already known).\n- I is absent.\n- B is correct at position 3 (already known).\n- E is correct at position 4 (already known).\n- S is absent.\n\nNow, combining all information:\n\n- The secret word starts with R, has B at position 3, and E at position 4. So the pattern is: R _ B E _\n- Known absent letters: C, A, N, O, D, I, S (from the feedback: C, A, N from guess1; O, D from guess2; I, S from guess3).\n- We also know that the word contains R, B, E (with fixed positions) and one more letter that we haven\'t identified? Actually, we know there are two missing letters: position 2 and position 5? But we have only one missing letter? No: the word has 5 letters, and we know positions 1,3,4: R, B, E. So positions 2 and 5 are unknown.\n\nBut we have ruled out many letters: C, A, N, O, D, I, S.\n\nAlso, from the first guess, we know that R and E are in the word (now fixed) and we have no indication of duplicates? So we assume no duplicates for now? But we cannot be sure.\n\nThe remaining letters for positions 2 and 5 must be from the letters not excluded.\n\nExcluded letters: A, C, D, I, N, O, S.\n\nSo allowed letters: B, E, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, R, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut note: we already have B, E, R in the word? And if there are no duplicates, then we cannot use B, E, R again? But we are missing two letters? So we need two new letters? But we have R, B, E already? So the other two must be different? Unless duplicates? But we have no evidence of duplicates.\n\nSo we assume no duplicates? Then the letters for position 2 and 5 must be from: F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we also know that the word must be valid.\n\nNow, the pattern: R ? B E ?\n\nWe need to fill position 2 and position 5 with two distinct letters from the allowed set? And not B, E, R? (if no duplicates).\n\nNow, what words fit this pattern?\n\nWe had ""RUBES"" and ""RUBEL"" as possibilities? But ""RUBES"" has S? But S is absent? So ""RUBES"" is invalid? Because S is absent? Similarly, ""RIBES"" we tried and S is absent? So ""RUBES"" also has S? So invalid.\n\n""RUBEL"": R U B E L -> position2: U, position5: L? But we haven\'t ruled out U and L? So it is possible.\n\nAre there other words?\n\nFor example:\n- ""RUBLE"": same as RUBEL? But spelling: R U B L E? Then position4 would be L? But we need position4 to be E? So no? ""RUBLE"" is R-U-B-L-E, so positions: 1:R, 2:U, 3:B, 4:L, 5:E? But we require position4 to be E? So it doesn\'t match.\n\n""RUBEL"" is R-U-B-E-L? Then positions: 1:R, 2:U, 3:B, 4:E, 5:L? Yes, that matches.\n\nOther words? \n- ""RABAT"" but A absent? No.\n- ""ROBED"" we tried? D absent? And O absent? No.\n- ""RUMBA"" but M? And A absent? And position4 is A? But we need E? No.\n- ""CUBED"" but C and D absent? No.\n- ""TUBER"" but T? But position1 is T? We need R? No.\n\nHow about ""RULER""? But that has R at the end? And two R\'s? But we have R at position1? So if we have ""RULER"": R U L E R? Then positions: 1:R, 2:U, 3:L, 4:E, 5:R? But we need position3 to be B? So not matching.\n\nAnother word: ""RUBY"" is 4 letters? No.\n\n""RUBLE"": same as RUBEL? But RUBEL is an alternative spelling? Or ""ROUBLE""? But O absent? So RUBEL is acceptable.\n\nBut are there other words? For example, ""RUBEFY""? Too long.\n\n""JUBE"" is 4 letters.\n\nPerhaps ""RUBEL"" is the only common word? But let\'s think of more.\n\n""RUBES"" is out because of S? And ""RIBES"" is out? So only ""RUBEL"" remains? But we have to check if U and L are allowed? We haven\'t ruled them out.\n\nBut we also have ""RUBLE""? But that\'s the same as RUBEL? Or ""ROUBLE"" with O? Absent.\n\nAnother possibility: ""RUBIN""? But N absent? And position4 would be I? But we need E? And I is absent? So no.\n\n""RUBID""? But D absent? And position4 I? No.\n\nSo ""RUBEL"" seems a candidate.\n\nBut we need to confirm: is ""RUBEL"" a valid word? Yes, it is a variant of rouble, a currency unit.\n\nBut we have another candidate? What about ""RUMEN""? But M? And position4 E? But then N? But N is absent? So no.\n\n""RUPEE"": R U P E E? But that has two E\'s? And position3 is P? Not B? So no.\n\n""RUBIO"": O absent? And I? But I is absent? And O absent? No.\n\nSo the only candidate we have is ""RUBEL"".\n\nBut we must consider that the word might have duplicates? For example, if the secret word has two E\'s? But we have E at position4? And if position5 is E? But we know from the first guess that E is not at position5? So position5 cannot be E? Because if it were, the first guess would have shown E at position5 as correct? Or at least present? But it was present but not at position5? So if there were two E\'s, and one is at position4? Then position5 could be E? But then in the first guess, when we guessed E at position5? It would be marked as present? Because there is an E at position5? But it was marked as present? But the feedback for E was ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not at that position? So if the secret word had E at position5, then when we guess E at position5, it should be marked as correct (✓)? But it was not? It was marked as present but wrong position? So that means the secret word does not have E at position5? Therefore, position5 cannot be E? So no duplicate E at position5.\n\nSimilarly, for other letters? We have no indication of duplicates? So we assume no duplicates? Then the secret word has exactly the letters R, B, E, and two others? Which are not excluded? And not R, B, E.\n\nTherefore, we can guess ""RUBEL"".\n\nBut we have to make sure? We have not tested U and L? So if we guess ""RUBEL"", we might get:\n\n- If correct, we win.\n- If not, we get feedback on U and L? Then we can adjust.\n\nBut since we have only one candidate? We can try.\n\nAlternatively, are there other words? \n\nWhat about ""RUBEY""? Not a word.\n\n""RUBED""? D absent? And E at position4? But D absent.\n\n""RUBEX""? Not common? And X? But we can check? ""RUBEX"" is not a standard word? \n\n""RUBIS""? But S absent? And I absent? No.\n\nSo I think ""RUBEL"" is the only common word.\n\nTherefore, we guess ""RUBEL"".\n\nSo next guess: ""RUBEL""\n\n<guess>rubel</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n\n1. **Guess 1: crane → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)**  \n   - **C, A, N** are absent.  \n   - **R** is present but not in position 2.  \n   - **E** is present but not in position 5.  \n\n2. **Guess 2: robed → Feedback: R(✓) O(x) B(✓) E(✓) D(x)**  \n   - **R** is correct at position 1.  \n   - **O** is absent.  \n   - **B** is correct at position 3.  \n   - **E** is correct at position 4.  \n   - **D** is absent.  \n   - **Pattern so far**: `R _ B E _` (positions 1, 3, and 4 are fixed).  \n\n3. **Guess 3: ribes → Feedback: R(✓) I(x) B(✓) E(✓) S(x)**  \n   - **I** is absent.  \n   - **S** is absent.  \n   - Confirms **R**, **B**, and **E** in their correct positions (1, 3, 4).  \n\n### Key Insights:\n- **Secret word pattern**: `R _ B E _` (positions 2 and 5 are unknown).  \n- **Absent letters**: A, C, D, I, N, O, S (cannot appear).  \n- **Present letters with known positions**:  \n  - **R** (position 1), **B** (position 3), **E** (position 4).  \n- **Constraints for positions 2 and 5**:  \n  - Must be letters **not** in the absent list (A, C, D, I, N, O, S).  \n  - Cannot be **R**, **B**, or **E** (assuming no duplicates, as no feedback suggests duplicates).  \n  - Position 5 cannot be **E** (from Guess 1 feedback).  \n- **Possible letters for positions 2 and 5**: F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  \n\n### Candidate Words:\n- The only common English word fitting `R _ B E _` with the constraints is **RUBEL** (a currency unit):  \n  - **R** (pos1), **U** (pos2), **B** (pos3), **E** (pos4), **L** (pos5).  \n- Other possibilities like ""RUBES"" or ""RIBES"" are invalid (S is absent).

We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Meaning: C, A, N absent; R present but not position 2; E present but not position 5.

Guess 2: ""robed"" -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) O(x) B(✓) E(✓) D(x)
Meaning: R correct at position 1; O absent; B correct at position 3; E correct at position 4; D absent.

Guess 3: ""ribes"" -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) I(x) B(✓) E(✓) S(x)
Meaning: R correct at position 1; I absent; B correct at position 3; E correct at position 4; S absent.

Guess 4: ""rubel"" -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) U(x) B(✓) E(✓) L(✓)
Meaning: R correct at position 1; U absent; B correct at position 3; E correct at position 4; L correct at position 5.

Now, the feedback for ""rubel"" shows:
- R, B, E, L are correct at their positions: so position 1: R, position 3: B, position 4: E, position 5: L.
- U is absent.

Therefore, the secret word is: R _ B E L, with the second letter missing.

We know the pattern: R ? B E L

We also know the absent letters: A, C, D, I, N, O, S, U (from the feedback: A, C, N from guess1; O, D from guess2; I, S from guess3; U from guess4).

The only missing letter is position 2.

We need to find a letter for position 2 that:
- Is not in the absent list: so not A, C, D, I, N, O, S, U.
- And not the letters we already have? But we have R, B, E, L? If no duplicates, then the letter must be different? But we don't know about duplicates? However, we have no indication of duplicates so far? So we assume no duplicates? Then the letter must be a new letter.

The set of allowed letters: all letters except A, C, D, I, N, O, S, U, and also excluding R, B, E, L (if no duplicates).

But we have to include the entire alphabet? The absent letters we know: A, C, D, I, N, O, S, U.

So the possible letters for position 2: F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to find a 5-letter word that is R ? B E L, and the ? is one of these letters.

What words are there?

For example:
- ""RABEL"": but A is absent? No.
- ""REBEL"": but E at position2? But we have E at position4? And if no duplicates? Then E cannot be at position2? Also, in ""REBEL"": R E B E L? That has two E's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? However, we have E at position4? If we have E at position2? Then it would be a duplicate? But we haven't seen any duplicate feedback? So it might be possible? But we also have to check the feedback: in the first guess, we had E at position5? And that was marked as present? But not at position5? So if there were two E's? Then when we guessed E at position5? It would be marked as present? But it was? So it could be? But in ""REBEL"", we have E at position2 and position4? So if we guess ""REBEL"", then position2: E? We don't know if that is correct? But we have not tested E at position2? 

But note: we know the secret word has E? But we only know it is at position4? It might be at other positions? But we have no evidence.

However, in the feedback for guess4, we have L at position5? And we have the pattern: R ? B E L.

If we try ""REBEL"", then:
- Position1: R (correct)
- Position2: E (we don't know? But if the secret word has E at position2? Then it would be marked? But we don't know)
- Position3: B (correct)
- Position4: E (correct)
- Position5: L (correct)

But we have to see if ""REBEL"" is a valid word? Yes.

But we have to check if E is allowed at position2? We don't have any feedback that E is not at position2? But we know E is in the word at position4? So if there is only one E? Then position2 cannot be E? But if there are two E's? Then it can.

But we don't know? So we should consider both possibilities.

But let's see if there are other words? For example, ""RUBEL"" we tried? And U is absent? So not.

""ROBEL""? O absent? No.

""RABEL""? A absent? No.

""RUMEL""? U absent? And M? But we haven't ruled out M? So ""RUMEL"" is R U M E L? But U is absent? So no.

""RIFLE""? But F? And position3 is F? We need B? No.

""RUBLE""? But U absent? And position4 is L? But we need E? No.

""RABBE""? But A absent? And two B's? And E at position5? But we have L at position5? No.

Another word: ""REBEL"" is one possibility? But let's see if there are others.

""RIVEL""? R I V E L? But I is absent? No.

""ROWEL""? O absent? No.

""RAVEL""? A absent? No.

""REVEL""? R E V E L? This has two E's? And V? So pattern: R E V E L? But we need position3 to be B? Not V? So no.

""RABBI""? Not 5 letters? And A absent? No.

""REBEL"" is the only common word that fits? But it has E at position2? And we have E at position4? So two E's? 

But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? However, the feedback has never indicated a duplicate? But we haven't guessed a duplicate? So it's possible.

But we have to check: in the first guess, we guessed ""crane"" with one E? And it was marked as present? But if there were two E's? Then we would have only one E marked? Because we only guessed one? So it's possible.

Similarly, in other guesses? We only guessed one E? So we don't know.

Therefore, ""REBEL"" is a candidate? But we need to see if it matches the pattern: R E B E L? But we need position3 to be B? In ""REBEL"", position3 is B? Yes: R E B E L? So positions: 1:R, 2:E, 3:B, 4:E, 5:L? So it matches the pattern? But we have E at position2 and position4? So two E's.

But we have to consider: the feedback for guess4: we guessed ""rubel"" and got L(✓) at position5? So the secret word has L at position5? And we have E at position4? So if the secret word is ""REBEL"", then it has E at position2 and position4? And L at position5? So when we guess ""rubel"", which is R U B E L? Then for position2: U? But the secret word has E at position2? So U is absent? Which matches the feedback (U(x)). Position5: L? Correct? So it fits.

But we also have to check the first guess: ""crane"" had E at position5? And the secret word ""REBEL"" has E at position2 and position4? But not at position5? So when we guessed E at position5? It was marked as present? Because there is an E? But not at position5? So that matches.

Similarly, all feedback matches.

But are there other words? For example, ""RUBEL"" we tried? But U is absent? And we got U(x)? So not.

What about ""RABEL""? A absent? No.

""ROBEL""? O absent? No.

""RUMEL""? U absent? No.

""RIFLE""? But position3 is F? Not B? No.

""RUBLE""? U absent? And pattern doesn't match? No.

""REBUS""? But S absent? And position3 is B? But position4 is U? Not E? And we have E at position4? So no.

So the only candidate is ""REBEL"".

But we have to make sure? Is there a word like ""REBEL"" that fits? Yes.

Therefore, the secret word must be ""REBEL"".

But we have not guessed it yet? So we can guess ""REBEL"".

But note: in the pattern, we have position2: ? and we are guessing E? But we know E is already in the word? So if there is no duplicate? Then it cannot be? But we are considering duplicate? So we guess ""REBEL"".

Alternatively, we can think of other words? Like ""RUBEL"" was incorrect? So we try ""REBEL"".

So next guess: ""REBEL""

But let me confirm the feedback we would get? If the secret word is ""REBEL"", then:

- Guess1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) because R is at position1? But we guessed R at position2? So it's present but wrong position? A(x) N(x) E(-) because E is at position5? But in secret word, E is at 2 and 4? So E is present? But not at position5? So marked as present? So feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-) -> matches.

- Guess2: ""robed"" -> R(✓) because position1 is R? O(x) B(✓) because position3 is B? E(✓) because position4 is E? D(x) -> matches.

- Guess3: ""ribes"" -> R(✓) I(x) B(✓) E(✓) S(x) -> because I and S are absent? And R, B, E correct? Matches.

- Guess4: ""rubel"" -> R(✓) U(x) because U not in word? B(✓) E(✓) L(✓) because L at position5? Matches.

So ""REBEL"" fits all.

Therefore, we guess ""REBEL"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
1. **Guess 1: crane → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)**  
   - **C, A, N** absent.  
   - **R** present but not in position 2.  
   - **E** present but not in position 5.  

2. **Guess 2: robed → Feedback: R(✓) O(x) B(✓) E(✓) D(x)**  
   - **R** correct at position 1.  
   - **O, D** absent.  
   - **B** correct at position 3.  
   - **E** correct at position 4.  
   - **Pattern**: `R _ B E _`.  

3. **Guess 3: ribes → Feedback: R(✓) I(x) B(✓) E(✓) S(x)**  
   - **I, S** absent.  
   - Confirms **R, B, E** in positions 1, 3, 4.  

4. **Guess 4: rubel → Feedback: R(✓) U(x) B(✓) E(✓) L(✓)**  
   - **U** absent.  
   - **L** correct at position 5.  
   - **Pattern**: `R _ B E L` (only position 2 is unknown).  

### Key Insights:
- **Secret word pattern**: `R ? B E L`.  
- **Absent letters**: A, C, D, I, N, O, S, U (cannot appear).  
- **Correct letters**:  
  - **R** (pos1), **B** (pos3), **E** (pos4), **L** (pos5).  
- **Constraints for position 2**:  
  - Must be a letter **not** in the absent list.  
  - Must be a letter **not** already in the word (assuming no duplicates, as no feedback indicates duplicates).  
  - Possible letters: **F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z**.  

### Deduction:
- The only common English word fitting `R ? B E L` with the constraints is **REBEL**:  
  - **R** (pos1), **E** (pos2), **B** (pos3), **E** (pos4), **L** (pos5).  
- **Why ""REBEL"" works?**  
  - **E** at position 2 is allowed (no feedback rules out **E** at position 2).  
  - Duplicate **E** is possible (no prior feedback contradicts duplicates).  
  - Fits all feedback:  
    - **Guess 1**: `E` is present (at pos2/4) but not at pos5.  
    - **Guess 2-4**: Confirms **R, B, E, L** positions and rules out **O, D, I, S, U**.  

<guess>rebel</guess>",rebel,"We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Meaning: C, A, N absent; R present but not position 2; E present but not position 5.

Guess 2: ""robed"" -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) O(x) B(✓) E(✓) D(x)
Meaning: R correct at position 1; O absent; B correct at position 3; E correct at position 4; D absent.

Guess 3: ""ribes"" -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) I(x) B(✓) E(✓) S(x)
Meaning: R correct at position 1; I absent; B correct at position 3; E correct at position 4; S absent.

Guess 4: ""rubel"" -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) U(x) B(✓) E(✓) L(✓)
Meaning: R correct at position 1; U absent; B correct at position 3; E correct at position 4; L correct at position 5.

Now, the feedback for ""rubel"" shows:
- R, B, E, L are correct at their positions: so position 1: R, position 3: B, position 4: E, position 5: L.
- U is absent.

Therefore, the secret word is: R _ B E L, with the second letter missing.

We know the pattern: R ? B E L

We also know the absent letters: A, C, D, I, N, O, S, U (from the feedback: A, C, N from guess1; O, D from guess2; I, S from guess3; U from guess4).

The only missing letter is position 2.

We need to find a letter for position 2 that:
- Is not in the absent list: so not A, C, D, I, N, O, S, U.
- And not the letters we already have? But we have R, B, E, L? If no duplicates, then the letter must be different? But we don't know about duplicates? However, we have no indication of duplicates so far? So we assume no duplicates? Then the letter must be a new letter.

The set of allowed letters: all letters except A, C, D, I, N, O, S, U, and also excluding R, B, E, L (if no duplicates).

But we have to include the entire alphabet? The absent letters we know: A, C, D, I, N, O, S, U.

So the possible letters for position 2: F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to find a 5-letter word that is R ? B E L, and the ? is one of these letters.

What words are there?

For example:
- ""RABEL"": but A is absent? No.
- ""REBEL"": but E at position2? But we have E at position4? And if no duplicates? Then E cannot be at position2? Also, in ""REBEL"": R E B E L? That has two E's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? However, we have E at position4? If we have E at position2? Then it would be a duplicate? But we haven't seen any duplicate feedback? So it might be possible? But we also have to check the feedback: in the first guess, we had E at position5? And that was marked as present? But not at position5? So if there were two E's? Then when we guessed E at position5? It would be marked as present? But it was? So it could be? But in ""REBEL"", we have E at position2 and position4? So if we guess ""REBEL"", then position2: E? We don't know if that is correct? But we have not tested E at position2? 

But note: we know the secret word has E? But we only know it is at position4? It might be at other positions? But we have no evidence.

However, in the feedback for guess4, we have L at position5? And we have the pattern: R ? B E L.

If we try ""REBEL"", then:
- Position1: R (correct)
- Position2: E (we don't know? But if the secret word has E at position2? Then it would be marked? But we don't know)
- Position3: B (correct)
- Position4: E (correct)
- Position5: L (correct)

But we have to see if ""REBEL"" is a valid word? Yes.

But we have to check if E is allowed at position2? We don't have any feedback that E is not at position2? But we know E is in the word at position4? So if there is only one E? Then position2 cannot be E? But if there are two E's? Then it can.

But we don't know? So we should consider both possibilities.

But let's see if there are other words? For example, ""RUBEL"" we tried? And U is absent? So not.

""ROBEL""? O absent? No.

""RABEL""? A absent? No.

""RUMEL""? U absent? And M? But we haven't ruled out M? So ""RUMEL"" is R U M E L? But U is absent? So no.

""RIFLE""? But F? And position3 is F? We need B? No.

""RUBLE""? But U absent? And position4 is L? But we need E? No.

""RABBE""? But A absent? And two B's? And E at position5? But we have L at position5? No.

Another word: ""REBEL"" is one possibility? But let's see if there are others.

""RIVEL""? R I V E L? But I is absent? No.

""ROWEL""? O absent? No.

""RAVEL""? A absent? No.

""REVEL""? R E V E L? This has two E's? And V? So pattern: R E V E L? But we need position3 to be B? Not V? So no.

""RABBI""? Not 5 letters? And A absent? No.

""REBEL"" is the only common word that fits? But it has E at position2? And we have E at position4? So two E's? 

But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? However, the feedback has never indicated a duplicate? But we haven't guessed a duplicate? So it's possible.

But we have to check: in the first guess, we guessed ""crane"" with one E? And it was marked as present? But if there were two E's? Then we would have only one E marked? Because we only guessed one? So it's possible.

Similarly, in other guesses? We only guessed one E? So we don't know.

Therefore, ""REBEL"" is a candidate? But we need to see if it matches the pattern: R E B E L? But we need position3 to be B? In ""REBEL"", position3 is B? Yes: R E B E L? So positions: 1:R, 2:E, 3:B, 4:E, 5:L? So it matches the pattern? But we have E at position2 and position4? So two E's.

But we have to consider: the feedback for guess4: we guessed ""rubel"" and got L(✓) at position5? So the secret word has L at position5? And we have E at position4? So if the secret word is ""REBEL"", then it has E at position2 and position4? And L at position5? So when we guess ""rubel"", which is R U B E L? Then for position2: U? But the secret word has E at position2? So U is absent? Which matches the feedback (U(x)). Position5: L? Correct? So it fits.

But we also have to check the first guess: ""crane"" had E at position5? And the secret word ""REBEL"" has E at position2 and position4? But not at position5? So when we guessed E at position5? It was marked as present? Because there is an E? But not at position5? So that matches.

Similarly, all feedback matches.

But are there other words? For example, ""RUBEL"" we tried? But U is absent? And we got U(x)? So not.

What about ""RABEL""? A absent? No.

""ROBEL""? O absent? No.

""RUMEL""? U absent? No.

""RIFLE""? But position3 is F? Not B? No.

""RUBLE""? U absent? And pattern doesn't match? No.

""REBUS""? But S absent? And position3 is B? But position4 is U? Not E? And we have E at position4? So no.

So the only candidate is ""REBEL"".

But we have to make sure? Is there a word like ""REBEL"" that fits? Yes.

Therefore, the secret word must be ""REBEL"".

But we have not guessed it yet? So we can guess ""REBEL"".

But note: in the pattern, we have position2: ? and we are guessing E? But we know E is already in the word? So if there is no duplicate? Then it cannot be? But we are considering duplicate? So we guess ""REBEL"".

Alternatively, we can think of other words? Like ""RUBEL"" was incorrect? So we try ""REBEL"".

So next guess: ""REBEL""

But let me confirm the feedback we would get? If the secret word is ""REBEL"", then:

- Guess1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) because R is at position1? But we guessed R at position2? So it's present but wrong position? A(x) N(x) E(-) because E is at position5? But in secret word, E is at 2 and 4? So E is present? But not at position5? So marked as present? So feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-) -> matches.

- Guess2: ""robed"" -> R(✓) because position1 is R? O(x) B(✓) because position3 is B? E(✓) because position4 is E? D(x) -> matches.

- Guess3: ""ribes"" -> R(✓) I(x) B(✓) E(✓) S(x) -> because I and S are absent? And R, B, E correct? Matches.

- Guess4: ""rubel"" -> R(✓) U(x) because U not in word? B(✓) E(✓) L(✓) because L at position5? Matches.

So ""REBEL"" fits all.

Therefore, we guess ""REBEL"".
