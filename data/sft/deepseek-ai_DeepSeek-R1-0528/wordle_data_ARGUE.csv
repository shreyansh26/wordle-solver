We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(✓), A(-), N(x), E(✓)

Interpretation:
- R is correct and in the correct position (second letter).
- E is correct and in the correct position (fifth letter).
- A is in the word but not in the correct position (it was in the third position in ""crane"").
- C and N are not in the word.

So, the secret word:
- Has R as the second letter.
- Has E as the fifth letter.
- Contains the letter A, but not in the third position (since we got a ""-"" for A, meaning it's present but misplaced).
- Does not contain C or N.

We also know the word is 5 letters.

We need to make a new guess that incorporates this information.

Step 1: Since R and E are fixed in positions 2 and 5, our word must be: _ R _ _ E

Step 2: The word must contain the letter A, but not in position 3. So A can be in position 1, 4, or ? But wait, the word has positions: 1,2,3,4,5 -> so A can be in 1,4? Actually, any position except 3, because it was misplaced at position 3.

But note: it might be in position 1 or 4, or even position 3? No, because we got a ""-"" meaning it's in the word but not in position 3. So A is in the word and must be in position 1 or 4? Or could it be repeated? Let me think: the feedback doesn't account for multiple letters. We have to be cautious.

In our guess, we had one A. The feedback says A is present (but not at position 3). So in the target word, there is at least one A, and it is not in position 3.

Therefore, for the word structure _ R _ _ E, the A could be in:
- Position 1: A R _ _ E
- Position 4: _ R _ A E

Position 5 is E, so A cannot be there. Position 2 is R. Position 3 is the only one we know it's not A. So A must be in position 1 or 4.

Moreover, we must avoid C and N.

We need a 5-letter word that fits: [letter1] R [letter3] [letter4] E, with A in either 1 or 4.

Also, we can include other letters to test possibilities.

Possible words:

Option 1: A in first position -> A R ? ? E
We need to fill the third and fourth positions with letters that are not C, N? But we don't know other missing letters. Moreover, we want to test more letters.

Option 2: A in fourth position -> ? R ? A E

Since we have limited tries, we want to guess a word that can give us more information.

Consider the missing letters: third and fourth positions are unknown in both cases, or the first and third in the second case.

Let me think of common words.

First, words with A in first position: ARISE, ARITE? Or ARGUE? But we must consider valid words.

Possible words:
- With A in position 1: ARISE, ARGUE, ABATE, etc. But we know the fifth letter is E, so the word must end with E. In ""ARISE"", it ends with E? ARISE -> A R I S E -> yes. Similarly, ARGUE -> A R G U E -> ends with E? Yes.

But let's check: ARISE: positions: A(1), R(2), I(3), S(4), E(5). Is this possible? We know that A cannot be in position 3? Yes, but in this word A is in position 1, which is allowed. Also, we need to avoid C and N? This word doesn't have C or N.

Similarly, we have ""ARGUE"": A R G U E.

But note: in our first guess, we had E at position 5 and we got an E(✓), so that's fixed.

What about the A: we had an A in position 3? No, in ""crane"": C R A N E -> A was in position 3 and we got ""-"", meaning A is not in position 3 in the secret word. So if we put A in position 1 (like in ARISE) that's fine.

But there is another possibility: A in position 4: like ? R ? A E.

Words like: GRAVE, TRACE? But TRACE has C? We cannot use C. TRACE has C? Yes, T R A C E -> that contains C. Since C is not in the word, we cannot use words with C.

Similarly, we must avoid N.

Possible words with A in position 4: BRADE? Not a word. GRADE? G R A D E -> A is in position 3? Not position 4. Position 4 would be D? So GRADE -> G R A D E: A is at position 3.

We need A at position 4: for example, BRAKE? B R A K E -> A is at position 3 again. Position 1: B, 2: R, 3: A, 4: K, 5: E. But we cannot have A at position 3 because of the feedback. The secret word does not have A at position 3? Yes, because when we guessed CRANE with A at 3, it was misplaced.

So BRAKE has A at position 3, which is forbidden? Meaning, if the word had A at position 3, we would have gotten a ""✓"", but we didn't. So we must avoid putting A at position 3.

Therefore, words like BRAKE have A at position 3 and are invalid for the secret word.

So, what are words that end with E, have R at position 2, and have A at position 4? Structure: _ R _ A E

Examples: GRAVE? G R A V E -> A at 3? No. Position: G(1), R(2), A(3), V(4), E(5). That's A at 3. Not good.

We need A at position 4: so position 4 is A, and position 5 is E. So the word must end with ""AE""? But AE is not common.

Actually, position 4 is A, position 5 is E: so the last two letters are AE? Like in UKRAINE? But that's 7 letters.

For 5 letters? Words ending with AE? In English, it's rare. Maybe ""PRAXE"" but not a word. We need common words.

Another option: the A is in position 1: so words starting with A and ending with E, R at position 2.

Common: ARISE, ARGUE, ABASE, ABATE, ADORE, etc.

Now, back to option with A at position 4: What about ""FRAUD"" but doesn't end with E. Or ""GRAZE""? G R A Z E? Position 1:G, 2:R, 3:A, 4:Z, 5:E -> A at 3.

I can't think of many words with A at position 4 and E at 5? Because A at 4 and E at 5 implies the last two are ""AE"", which isn't typical in English. There might be words like ""URAE"" but that's too short.

Perhaps there are words where position 4 is A and 5 is E? For example: ""ROUE""? No, that's R O U E -> 4 letters.

5-letter words: are there any that end with ""R A E""? No. The word ends with E? Yes. Actually, the structure is _ R _ A E. So the last three characters are A E? Not possible? Because position 5 is E, and position 4 is A? Then it ends with AE? Words ending with AE: often from Greek or Latin roots like ""abscissae"" but that's 9 letters. There might be rare ones, but let's assume the secret word is common.

Given the difficulty, perhaps A is at position 1? That seems more likely.

Also, note that in the first guess, we had E in position 5 and got ""in the word and correct"", so we can be sure about E at the end.

The feedback for A: it was in position 3 of our guess and was misplaced. So A is in the word, not at position 3.

Therefore, A must be at position 1 or 4 (since position 2 is R and 5 is E, so only positions 1 or 4 are available). Position 4: because the word is 5 letters? Positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

Position 2 is fixed R, position 5 fixed E. Position 3: we know A is not there. So A can be in position 1 or 4.

However, if A is at position 4, then the word ends with AE? That's rare. So position 1 might be more common.

But wait, there is also the possibility that the word has more than one A? But we don't know.

For now, let's assume A is at position 1. Then we can try a word like ARISE.

ARISE: A at 1, R at 2, I at 3, S at 4, E at 5.

But we must check if this word contains letters we know are not there? It has no C or N? Yes: A,R,I,S,E. C? No. N? No.

So ARISE is a valid guess.

Moreover, it includes new letters: I and S.

Alternatively, we could try a word that tests A at position 4? But if we try to put A at position 4, we might guess a word that has A in both? But we don't know.

Another idea: since we are not sure where A is, we can choose a word that has A in a different position? But the feedback implies it must be in 1 or 4. Also, we are forced because the positions 1 and 4 are open.

But note: we are allowed to include other occurrences of A? The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. So we could ask: is it possible the word has A at position 1 and also elsewhere? Or at position 4 and elsewhere? We don't know.

For now, let's try to confirm the position.

But since we have only 6 tries, we should choose a word that can test multiple possibilities.

Perhaps we can choose a word that has A at either position 1 or 4? But we can't put both? Unless duplicates.

But let's list possibilities.

First, for A at position 1: we'll get an A in the guess at position 1? And if it's correct, we get a ✓. Otherwise, we'll get - or x. Since we are guessing it at position 1, if it's actually at position 1 we get ✓; if at position 4 we get - (if included) or x if not present? But we know it is present.

But in a guess of ARISE: if A is at position 1, then A(✓); if not, but A is in the word (at position 4), then we might get - for A? But in position 1, if A is not there? Then we'd get x? But from the feedback we know A is present? Actually, regardless of position, if A is in the word, wherever we put it? But let's recall:

In the feedback, each letter gets a symbol based on its occurrence. If the secret word has A in it (at least one), then the A in our guess would get a ✓ if it's at the same position? Or a - if it's at a different position? Unless the secret had multiple A and one matched? That complicates.

But in this case, if we guess ARISE and the secret word has A at position 4? Then we would get:
- A: since we put at position 1, and secret has A only at position 4? Then we get a ""-"" for A, meaning it's present but not at position 1? And the S? Then feedback would be: A(-), R(✓), I(...), S(...), E(✓).

Similarly, if the secret word has A at position 1, we get A(✓), R(✓), etc.

So by guessing ARISE, we can verify if A is at position 1 or not? Well, if the secret is ARISE, we win. Otherwise, if we get R(✓) and E(✓) and A gets ✓, then we've confirmed position 1.

If A gets -, then we know A is not at position 1? So it must be at position 4? Because those are the only two options.

Earlier we thought A must be in 1 or 4? Is that true? What about multiple letters?

Example: the secret word might have A in position 1 and 3? But no, because we guessed A at position 3? And it was missing? If the secret had A at position 3, we would have gotten a ✓? Because CRANE had A at position 3? But we got a ""-"", meaning not ✓? So no, the secret does not have any A at position 3? So it's not at position 3? But if it had two A's? One at 1 and another at 3? Then when we guessed CRANE: C at 1? Got x because C is not there? But R at 2? ✓, A at 3: since there's an A at position 3? We should get ✓? But we got ""-"" meaning? Wordle's feedback: if the secret has duplicate letters, and you guess one? The feedback prioritizes exact matches first? Then any misplaced? But in any case, when we guessed CRANE with A at position 3:

Scenario 1: secret has A at position 3: then we get ✓ at position 3.

Scenario 2: secret has A not at position 3? But elsewhere: then we get -.

Since we got -, that indicates that there is an A in the secret? But not at position 3? So any A at other positions? So it's possible to have A at position 1 or 4? Or even position 2 but position 2 is R? So position 2 is fixed as R? Which is not A? So A can only be at position 1 or 4? Or even if duplicate? But not at 3.

So if we guess ARISE:

- If the secret has A at position 1: then A in our guess (position 1) gets ✓.
- If the secret has A only at position 4, then A at position 1 gets ""-"" because it's present but at wrong place? Because we didn't guess A at position 4 yet? But it will register it? Unless the secret had multiple A? But again, when we guessed CRANE, one A was guessed? And only one ""-"" for A? Meaning? Possibly the secret has exactly one A? Or at least one? But not at position 3? So if we guess ARISE and the secret has A at position 4 only? Then the A at position 1 of our guess will trigger a ""-"" for A? Because it's present elsewhere? But it doesn't affect other letters? Except that the ""-"" counts per letter? Typically per occurrence? Wordle handles duplicates: if the secret has one A and you guess two? Then only one will be marked? But in this case, our guess has one A? So:

Guess: A R I S E

Secret: _ R ? A E? Then:
- Position 1: A? But secret has A at position 4? And not at position 1? Then A gets ""-""?
- R is at position 2? And we know R is ✓?
- I? Unknown?
- S: unknown?
- E: ✓ at 5.

Similarly, if secret had A at position 1 and position 4? Then we get ✓ at position 1? And the A at position 4 does not matter? But we didn't guess position 4? So feedback would show A at position 1: ✓? Since it's exact? And the other A at position 4 might not be reflected? So we don't know if there is another A? Anyway, that's fine? Because we want to find the word.

So by guessing ARISE, we get to know about position 1 for A? And the other letters I and S.

Moreover, ARISE is a common word? Yes.

Therefore, I'll go with ARISE.

But let's think of other options? What about ""ARGUE""? Without N and C.

ARISE covers I and S, which are common letters? That's good? For information gathering.

After this guess, we'll know more about positions.

Therefore, my second guess is ARISE.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the previous guess ""crane"" (C not in word, R correct position, A in word but wrong position, N not in word, E correct position), we know:
- The secret word has R as the second letter.
- The secret word has E as the fifth letter.
- The secret word contains A, but not in the third position (since it was misplaced there).
- The secret word does not contain C or N.

Given that R is fixed at position 2 and E is fixed at position 5, the word pattern is: _ R _ _ E  
Additionally, A must be in the word but not at position 3. Since positions 1 and 4 are the only available slots (position 2 is R and position 5 is E), A must be at position 1 or 4.

To test this, ""arise"" is a strong second guess:
- It places A at position 1 to check if it belongs there.
- It introduces new common letters (I and S) to gather more information.
- It avoids forbidden letters (C and N).
- If A is at position 1, feedback will confirm it with ✓. If A is at position 4, feedback may show A as misplaced (-), and the word will still fit the pattern.

<guess>arise</guess>",arise,"We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(✓), A(-), N(x), E(✓)

Interpretation:
- R is correct and in the correct position (second letter).
- E is correct and in the correct position (fifth letter).
- A is in the word but not in the correct position (it was in the third position in ""crane"").
- C and N are not in the word.

So, the secret word:
- Has R as the second letter.
- Has E as the fifth letter.
- Contains the letter A, but not in the third position (since we got a ""-"" for A, meaning it's present but misplaced).
- Does not contain C or N.

We also know the word is 5 letters.

We need to make a new guess that incorporates this information.

Step 1: Since R and E are fixed in positions 2 and 5, our word must be: _ R _ _ E

Step 2: The word must contain the letter A, but not in position 3. So A can be in position 1, 4, or ? But wait, the word has positions: 1,2,3,4,5 -> so A can be in 1,4? Actually, any position except 3, because it was misplaced at position 3.

But note: it might be in position 1 or 4, or even position 3? No, because we got a ""-"" meaning it's in the word but not in position 3. So A is in the word and must be in position 1 or 4? Or could it be repeated? Let me think: the feedback doesn't account for multiple letters. We have to be cautious.

- Position 1: A R _ _ E
- Position 4: _ R _ A E

Position 5 is E, so A cannot be there. Position 2 is R. Position 3 is the only one we know it's not A. So A must be in position 1 or 4.

Moreover, we must avoid C and N.

We need a 5-letter word that fits: [letter1] R [letter3] [letter4] E, with A in either 1 or 4.

Also, we can include other letters to test possibilities.

Similarly, we have ""ARGUE"": A R G U E.

But note: in our first guess, we had E at position 5 and we got an E(✓), so that's fixed.

What about the A: we had an A in position 3? No, in ""crane"": C R A N E -> A was in position 3 and we got ""-"", meaning A is not in position 3 in the secret word. So if we put A in position 1 (like in ARISE) that's fine.

But there is another possibility: A in position 4: like ? R ? A E.

Words like: GRAVE, TRACE? But TRACE has C? We cannot use C. TRACE has C? Yes, T R A C E -> that contains C. Since C is not in the word, we cannot use words with C.

Similarly, we must avoid N.

Possible words with A in position 4: BRADE? Not a word. GRADE? G R A D E -> A is in position 3? Not position 4. Position 4 would be D? So GRADE -> G R A D E: A is at position 3.

We need A at position 4: for example, BRAKE? B R A K E -> A is at position 3 again. Position 1: B, 2: R, 3: A, 4: K, 5: E. But we cannot have A at position 3 because of the feedback. The secret word does not have A at position 3? Yes, because when we guessed CRANE with A at 3, it was misplaced.

So BRAKE has A at position 3, which is forbidden? Meaning, if the word had A at position 3, we would have gotten a ""✓"", but we didn't. So we must avoid putting A at position 3.

Therefore, words like BRAKE have A at position 3 and are invalid for the secret word.

So, what are words that end with E, have R at position 2, and have A at position 4? Structure: _ R _ A E

Examples: GRAVE? G R A V E -> A at 3? No. Position: G(1), R(2), A(3), V(4), E(5). That's A at 3. Not good.

Another option: the A is in position 1: so words starting with A and ending with E, R at position 2.

Common: ARISE, ARGUE, ABASE, ABATE, ADORE, etc.

Now, back to option with A at position 4: What about ""FRAUD"" but doesn't end with E. Or ""GRAZE""? G R A Z E? Position 1:G, 2:R, 3:A, 4:Z, 5:E -> A at 3.

I can't think of many words with A at position 4 and E at 5? Because A at 4 and E at 5 implies the last two are ""AE"", which isn't typical in English. There might be words like ""URAE"" but that's too short.

Perhaps there are words where position 4 is A and 5 is E? For example: ""ROUE""? No, that's R O U E -> 4 letters.

5-letter words: are there any that end with ""R A E""? No. The word ends with E? Yes. Actually, the structure is _ R _ A E. So the last three characters are A E? Not possible? Because position 5 is E, and position 4 is A? Then it ends with AE? Words ending with AE: often from Greek or Latin roots like ""abscissae"" but that's 9 letters. There might be rare ones, but let's assume the secret word is common.

Given the difficulty, perhaps A is at position 1? That seems more likely.

Also, note that in the first guess, we had E in position 5 and got ""in the word and correct"", so we can be sure about E at the end.

The feedback for A: it was in position 3 of our guess and was misplaced. So A is in the word, not at position 3.

Therefore, A must be at position 1 or 4 (since position 2 is R and 5 is E, so only positions 1 or 4 are available). Position 4: because the word is 5 letters? Positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

Position 2 is fixed R, position 5 fixed E. Position 3: we know A is not there. So A can be in position 1 or 4.

However, if A is at position 4, then the word ends with AE? That's rare. So position 1 might be more common.

But wait, there is also the possibility that the word has more than one A? But we don't know.

For now, let's assume A is at position 1. Then we can try a word like ARISE.

ARISE: A at 1, R at 2, I at 3, S at 4, E at 5.

But we must check if this word contains letters we know are not there? It has no C or N? Yes: A,R,I,S,E. C? No. N? No.

So ARISE is a valid guess.

Moreover, it includes new letters: I and S.

Alternatively, we could try a word that tests A at position 4? But if we try to put A at position 4, we might guess a word that has A in both? But we don't know.

Another idea: since we are not sure where A is, we can choose a word that has A in a different position? But the feedback implies it must be in 1 or 4. Also, we are forced because the positions 1 and 4 are open.

But note: we are allowed to include other occurrences of A? The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. So we could ask: is it possible the word has A at position 1 and also elsewhere? Or at position 4 and elsewhere? We don't know.

For now, let's try to confirm the position.

But since we have only 6 tries, we should choose a word that can test multiple possibilities.

Perhaps we can choose a word that has A at either position 1 or 4? But we can't put both? Unless duplicates.

But let's list possibilities.

First, for A at position 1: we'll get an A in the guess at position 1? And if it's correct, we get a ✓. Otherwise, we'll get - or x. Since we are guessing it at position 1, if it's actually at position 1 we get ✓; if at position 4 we get - (if included) or x if not present? But we know it is present.

But in a guess of ARISE: if A is at position 1, then A(✓); if not, but A is in the word (at position 4), then we might get - for A? But in position 1, if A is not there? Then we'd get x? But from the feedback we know A is present? Actually, regardless of position, if A is in the word, wherever we put it? But let's recall:

In the feedback, each letter gets a symbol based on its occurrence. If the secret word has A in it (at least one), then the A in our guess would get a ✓ if it's at the same position? Or a - if it's at a different position? Unless the secret had multiple A and one matched? That complicates.

But in this case, if we guess ARISE and the secret word has A at position 4? Then we would get:
- A: since we put at position 1, and secret has A only at position 4? Then we get a ""-"" for A, meaning it's present but not at position 1? And the S? Then feedback would be: A(-), R(✓), I(...), S(...), E(✓).

Similarly, if the secret word has A at position 1, we get A(✓), R(✓), etc.

So by guessing ARISE, we can verify if A is at position 1 or not? Well, if the secret is ARISE, we win. Otherwise, if we get R(✓) and E(✓) and A gets ✓, then we've confirmed position 1.

If A gets -, then we know A is not at position 1? So it must be at position 4? Because those are the only two options.

Earlier we thought A must be in 1 or 4? Is that true? What about multiple letters?

Example: the secret word might have A in position 1 and 3? But no, because we guessed A at position 3? And it was missing? If the secret had A at position 3, we would have gotten a ✓? Because CRANE had A at position 3? But we got a ""-"", meaning not ✓? So no, the secret does not have any A at position 3? So it's not at position 3? But if it had two A's? One at 1 and another at 3? Then when we guessed CRANE: C at 1? Got x because C is not there? But R at 2? ✓, A at 3: since there's an A at position 3? We should get ✓? But we got ""-"" meaning? Wordle's feedback: if the secret has duplicate letters, and you guess one? The feedback prioritizes exact matches first? Then any misplaced? But in any case, when we guessed CRANE with A at position 3:

Scenario 1: secret has A at position 3: then we get ✓ at position 3.

Scenario 2: secret has A not at position 3? But elsewhere: then we get -.

Since we got -, that indicates that there is an A in the secret? But not at position 3? So any A at other positions? So it's possible to have A at position 1 or 4? Or even position 2 but position 2 is R? So position 2 is fixed as R? Which is not A? So A can only be at position 1 or 4? Or even if duplicate? But not at 3.

So if we guess ARISE:

- If the secret has A at position 1: then A in our guess (position 1) gets ✓.
- If the secret has A only at position 4, then A at position 1 gets ""-"" because it's present but at wrong place? Because we didn't guess A at position 4 yet? But it will register it? Unless the secret had multiple A? But again, when we guessed CRANE, one A was guessed? And only one ""-"" for A? Meaning? Possibly the secret has exactly one A? Or at least one? But not at position 3? So if we guess ARISE and the secret has A at position 4 only? Then the A at position 1 of our guess will trigger a ""-"" for A? Because it's present elsewhere? But it doesn't affect other letters? Except that the ""-"" counts per letter? Typically per occurrence? Wordle handles duplicates: if the secret has one A and you guess two? Then only one will be marked? But in this case, our guess has one A? So:

Guess: A R I S E

Secret: _ R ? A E? Then:
- Position 1: A? But secret has A at position 4? And not at position 1? Then A gets ""-""?
- R is at position 2? And we know R is ✓?
- I? Unknown?
- S: unknown?
- E: ✓ at 5.

Similarly, if secret had A at position 1 and position 4? Then we get ✓ at position 1? And the A at position 4 does not matter? But we didn't guess position 4? So feedback would show A at position 1: ✓? Since it's exact? And the other A at position 4 might not be reflected? So we don't know if there is another A? Anyway, that's fine? Because we want to find the word.

So by guessing ARISE, we get to know about position 1 for A? And the other letters I and S.

Moreover, ARISE is a common word? Yes.

Therefore, I'll go with ARISE.

But let's think of other options? What about ""ARGUE""? Without N and C.

ARISE covers I and S, which are common letters? That's good? For information gathering.

After this guess, we'll know more about positions.

Therefore, my second guess is ARISE.Based on the feedback from the previous guess ""crane"" (C not in word, R correct position, A in word but wrong position, N not in word, E correct position), we know:
- The secret word has R as the second letter.
- The secret word has E as the fifth letter.
- The secret word contains A, but not in the third position (since it was misplaced there).
- The secret word does not contain C or N.

Given that R is fixed at position 2 and E is fixed at position 5, the word pattern is: _ R _ _ E  
Additionally, A must be in the word but not at position 3. Since positions 1 and 4 are the only available slots (position 2 is R and position 5 is E), A must be at position 1 or 4.

To test this, ""arise"" is a strong second guess:
- It places A at position 1 to check if it belongs there.
- It introduces new common letters (I and S) to gather more information.
- It avoids forbidden letters (C and N).
- If A is at position 1, feedback will confirm it with ✓. If A is at position 4, feedback may show A as misplaced (-), and the word will still fit the pattern.",Guess 2: arise -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(✓) I(x) S(x) E(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,ARGUE,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it is a popular starting word that covers common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(✓), A(-), N(x), E(✓)

Interpretation:
- R is correct and in the correct position (second letter).
- E is correct and in the correct position (fifth letter).
- A is in the word but not in the correct position (it was in the third position in ""crane"").
- C and N are not in the word.

So, the secret word:
- Has R as the second letter.
- Has E as the fifth letter.
- Contains the letter A, but not in the third position (since we got a ""-"" for A, meaning it's present but misplaced).
- Does not contain C or N.

We also know the word is 5 letters.

We need to make a new guess that incorporates this information.

Step 1: Since R and E are fixed in positions 2 and 5, our word must be: _ R _ _ E

Step 2: The word must contain the letter A, but not in position 3. So A can be in position 1, 4, or ? But wait, the word has positions: 1,2,3,4,5 -> so A can be in 1,4? Actually, any position except 3, because it was misplaced at position 3.

But note: it might be in position 1 or 4, or even position 3? No, because we got a ""-"" meaning it's in the word but not in position 3. So A is in the word and must be in position 1 or 4? Or could it be repeated? Let me think: the feedback doesn't account for multiple letters. We have to be cautious.

In our guess, we had one A. The feedback says A is present (but not at position 3). So in the target word, there is at least one A, and it is not in position 3.

Therefore, for the word structure _ R _ _ E, the A could be in:
- Position 1: A R _ _ E
- Position 4: _ R _ A E

Position 5 is E, so A cannot be there. Position 2 is R. Position 3 is the only one we know it's not A. So A must be in position 1 or 4.

Moreover, we must avoid C and N.

We need a 5-letter word that fits: [letter1] R [letter3] [letter4] E, with A in either 1 or 4.

Also, we can include other letters to test possibilities.

Possible words:

Option 1: A in first position -> A R ? ? E
We need to fill the third and fourth positions with letters that are not C, N? But we don't know other missing letters. Moreover, we want to test more letters.

Option 2: A in fourth position -> ? R ? A E

Since we have limited tries, we want to guess a word that can give us more information.

Consider the missing letters: third and fourth positions are unknown in both cases, or the first and third in the second case.

Let me think of common words.

First, words with A in first position: ARISE, ARITE? Or ARGUE? But we must consider valid words.

Possible words:
- With A in position 1: ARISE, ARGUE, ABATE, etc. But we know the fifth letter is E, so the word must end with E. In ""ARISE"", it ends with E? ARISE -> A R I S E -> yes. Similarly, ARGUE -> A R G U E -> ends with E? Yes.

But let's check: ARISE: positions: A(1), R(2), I(3), S(4), E(5). Is this possible? We know that A cannot be in position 3? Yes, but in this word A is in position 1, which is allowed. Also, we need to avoid C and N? This word doesn't have C or N.

Similarly, we have ""ARGUE"": A R G U E.

But note: in our first guess, we had E at position 5 and we got an E(✓), so that's fixed.

What about the A: we had an A in position 3? No, in ""crane"": C R A N E -> A was in position 3 and we got ""-"", meaning A is not in position 3 in the secret word. So if we put A in position 1 (like in ARISE) that's fine.

But there is another possibility: A in position 4: like ? R ? A E.

Words like: GRAVE, TRACE? But TRACE has C? We cannot use C. TRACE has C? Yes, T R A C E -> that contains C. Since C is not in the word, we cannot use words with C.

Similarly, we must avoid N.

Possible words with A in position 4: BRADE? Not a word. GRADE? G R A D E -> A is in position 3? Not position 4. Position 4 would be D? So GRADE -> G R A D E: A is at position 3.

We need A at position 4: for example, BRAKE? B R A K E -> A is at position 3 again. Position 1: B, 2: R, 3: A, 4: K, 5: E. But we cannot have A at position 3 because of the feedback. The secret word does not have A at position 3? Yes, because when we guessed CRANE with A at 3, it was misplaced.

So BRAKE has A at position 3, which is forbidden? Meaning, if the word had A at position 3, we would have gotten a ""✓"", but we didn't. So we must avoid putting A at position 3.

Therefore, words like BRAKE have A at position 3 and are invalid for the secret word.

So, what are words that end with E, have R at position 2, and have A at position 4? Structure: _ R _ A E

Examples: GRAVE? G R A V E -> A at 3? No. Position: G(1), R(2), A(3), V(4), E(5). That's A at 3. Not good.

We need A at position 4: so position 4 is A, and position 5 is E. So the word must end with ""AE""? But AE is not common.

Actually, position 4 is A, position 5 is E: so the last two letters are AE? Like in UKRAINE? But that's 7 letters.

For 5 letters? Words ending with AE? In English, it's rare. Maybe ""PRAXE"" but not a word. We need common words.

Another option: the A is in position 1: so words starting with A and ending with E, R at position 2.

Common: ARISE, ARGUE, ABASE, ABATE, ADORE, etc.

Now, back to option with A at position 4: What about ""FRAUD"" but doesn't end with E. Or ""GRAZE""? G R A Z E? Position 1:G, 2:R, 3:A, 4:Z, 5:E -> A at 3.

I can't think of many words with A at position 4 and E at 5? Because A at 4 and E at 5 implies the last two are ""AE"", which isn't typical in English. There might be words like ""URAE"" but that's too short.

Perhaps there are words where position 4 is A and 5 is E? For example: ""ROUE""? No, that's R O U E -> 4 letters.

5-letter words: are there any that end with ""R A E""? No. The word ends with E? Yes. Actually, the structure is _ R _ A E. So the last three characters are A E? Not possible? Because position 5 is E, and position 4 is A? Then it ends with AE? Words ending with AE: often from Greek or Latin roots like ""abscissae"" but that's 9 letters. There might be rare ones, but let's assume the secret word is common.

Given the difficulty, perhaps A is at position 1? That seems more likely.

Also, note that in the first guess, we had E in position 5 and got ""in the word and correct"", so we can be sure about E at the end.

The feedback for A: it was in position 3 of our guess and was misplaced. So A is in the word, not at position 3.

Therefore, A must be at position 1 or 4 (since position 2 is R and 5 is E, so only positions 1 or 4 are available). Position 4: because the word is 5 letters? Positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

Position 2 is fixed R, position 5 fixed E. Position 3: we know A is not there. So A can be in position 1 or 4.

However, if A is at position 4, then the word ends with AE? That's rare. So position 1 might be more common.

But wait, there is also the possibility that the word has more than one A? But we don't know.

For now, let's assume A is at position 1. Then we can try a word like ARISE.

ARISE: A at 1, R at 2, I at 3, S at 4, E at 5.

But we must check if this word contains letters we know are not there? It has no C or N? Yes: A,R,I,S,E. C? No. N? No.

So ARISE is a valid guess.

Moreover, it includes new letters: I and S.

Alternatively, we could try a word that tests A at position 4? But if we try to put A at position 4, we might guess a word that has A in both? But we don't know.

Another idea: since we are not sure where A is, we can choose a word that has A in a different position? But the feedback implies it must be in 1 or 4. Also, we are forced because the positions 1 and 4 are open.

But note: we are allowed to include other occurrences of A? The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. So we could ask: is it possible the word has A at position 1 and also elsewhere? Or at position 4 and elsewhere? We don't know.

For now, let's try to confirm the position.

But since we have only 6 tries, we should choose a word that can test multiple possibilities.

Perhaps we can choose a word that has A at either position 1 or 4? But we can't put both? Unless duplicates.

But let's list possibilities.

First, for A at position 1: we'll get an A in the guess at position 1? And if it's correct, we get a ✓. Otherwise, we'll get - or x. Since we are guessing it at position 1, if it's actually at position 1 we get ✓; if at position 4 we get - (if included) or x if not present? But we know it is present.

But in a guess of ARISE: if A is at position 1, then A(✓); if not, but A is in the word (at position 4), then we might get - for A? But in position 1, if A is not there? Then we'd get x? But from the feedback we know A is present? Actually, regardless of position, if A is in the word, wherever we put it? But let's recall:

In the feedback, each letter gets a symbol based on its occurrence. If the secret word has A in it (at least one), then the A in our guess would get a ✓ if it's at the same position? Or a - if it's at a different position? Unless the secret had multiple A and one matched? That complicates.

But in this case, if we guess ARISE and the secret word has A at position 4? Then we would get:
- A: since we put at position 1, and secret has A only at position 4? Then we get a ""-"" for A, meaning it's present but not at position 1? And the S? Then feedback would be: A(-), R(✓), I(...), S(...), E(✓).

Similarly, if the secret word has A at position 1, we get A(✓), R(✓), etc.

So by guessing ARISE, we can verify if A is at position 1 or not? Well, if the secret is ARISE, we win. Otherwise, if we get R(✓) and E(✓) and A gets ✓, then we've confirmed position 1.

If A gets -, then we know A is not at position 1? So it must be at position 4? Because those are the only two options.

Earlier we thought A must be in 1 or 4? Is that true? What about multiple letters?

Example: the secret word might have A in position 1 and 3? But no, because we guessed A at position 3? And it was missing? If the secret had A at position 3, we would have gotten a ✓? Because CRANE had A at position 3? But we got a ""-"", meaning not ✓? So no, the secret does not have any A at position 3? So it's not at position 3? But if it had two A's? One at 1 and another at 3? Then when we guessed CRANE: C at 1? Got x because C is not there? But R at 2? ✓, A at 3: since there's an A at position 3? We should get ✓? But we got ""-"" meaning? Wordle's feedback: if the secret has duplicate letters, and you guess one? The feedback prioritizes exact matches first? Then any misplaced? But in any case, when we guessed CRANE with A at position 3:

Scenario 1: secret has A at position 3: then we get ✓ at position 3.

Scenario 2: secret has A not at position 3? But elsewhere: then we get -.

Since we got -, that indicates that there is an A in the secret? But not at position 3? So any A at other positions? So it's possible to have A at position 1 or 4? Or even position 2 but position 2 is R? So position 2 is fixed as R? Which is not A? So A can only be at position 1 or 4? Or even if duplicate? But not at 3.

So if we guess ARISE:

- If the secret has A at position 1: then A in our guess (position 1) gets ✓.
- If the secret has A only at position 4, then A at position 1 gets ""-"" because it's present but at wrong place? Because we didn't guess A at position 4 yet? But it will register it? Unless the secret had multiple A? But again, when we guessed CRANE, one A was guessed? And only one ""-"" for A? Meaning? Possibly the secret has exactly one A? Or at least one? But not at position 3? So if we guess ARISE and the secret has A at position 4 only? Then the A at position 1 of our guess will trigger a ""-"" for A? Because it's present elsewhere? But it doesn't affect other letters? Except that the ""-"" counts per letter? Typically per occurrence? Wordle handles duplicates: if the secret has one A and you guess two? Then only one will be marked? But in this case, our guess has one A? So:

Guess: A R I S E

Secret: _ R ? A E? Then:
- Position 1: A? But secret has A at position 4? And not at position 1? Then A gets ""-""?
- R is at position 2? And we know R is ✓?
- I? Unknown?
- S: unknown?
- E: ✓ at 5.

Similarly, if secret had A at position 1 and position 4? Then we get ✓ at position 1? And the A at position 4 does not matter? But we didn't guess position 4? So feedback would show A at position 1: ✓? Since it's exact? And the other A at position 4 might not be reflected? So we don't know if there is another A? Anyway, that's fine? Because we want to find the word.

So by guessing ARISE, we get to know about position 1 for A? And the other letters I and S.

Moreover, ARISE is a common word? Yes.

Therefore, I'll go with ARISE.

But let's think of other options? What about ""ARGUE""? Without N and C.

ARISE covers I and S, which are common letters? That's good? For information gathering.

After this guess, we'll know more about positions.

Therefore, my second guess is ARISE.Based on the feedback from the previous guess ""crane"" (C not in word, R correct position, A in word but wrong position, N not in word, E correct position), we know:
- The secret word has R as the second letter.
- The secret word has E as the fifth letter.
- The secret word contains A, but not in the third position (since it was misplaced there).
- The secret word does not contain C or N.

Given that R is fixed at position 2 and E is fixed at position 5, the word pattern is: _ R _ _ E  
Additionally, A must be in the word but not at position 3. Since positions 1 and 4 are the only available slots (position 2 is R and position 5 is E), A must be at position 1 or 4.

To test this, ""arise"" is a strong second guess:
- It places A at position 1 to check if it belongs there.
- It introduces new common letters (I and S) to gather more information.
- It avoids forbidden letters (C and N).
- If A is at position 1, feedback will confirm it with ✓. If A is at position 4, feedback may show A as misplaced (-), and the word will still fit the pattern.

No, because we got a ""-"" meaning it\'s in the word but not in position 3. So A is in the word and must be in position 1 or 4? Or could it be repeated? Let me think: the feedback doesn\'t account for multiple letters. We have to be cautious.\n\nIn our guess, we had one A. The feedback says A is present (but not at position 3). So in the target word, there is at least one A, and it is not in position 3.\n\nTherefore, for the word structure _ R _ _ E, the A could be in:\n- Position 1: A R _ _ E\n- Position 4: _ R _ A E\n\nPosition 5 is E, so A cannot be there. Position 2 is R. Position 3 is the only one we know it\'s not A. So A must be in position 1 or 4.\n\nMoreover, we must avoid C and N.\n\nWe need a 5-letter word that fits: [letter1] R [letter3] [letter4] E, with A in either 1 or 4.\n\nAlso, we can include other letters to test possibilities.\n\nPossible words:\n\nOption 1: A in first position -> A R ? ? E\nWe need to fill the third and fourth positions with letters that are not C, N? But we don\'t know other missing letters. Moreover, we want to test more letters.\n\nOption 2: A in fourth position -> ? R ? A E\n\nSince we have limited tries, we want to guess a word that can give us more information.\n\nConsider the missing letters: third and fourth positions are unknown in both cases, or the first and third in the second case.\n\nLet me think of common words.\n\nFirst, words with A in first position: ARISE, ARITE? Or ARGUE? But we must consider valid words.\n\nPossible words:\n- With A in position 1: ARISE, ARGUE, ABATE, etc. But we know the fifth letter is E, so the word must end with E. In ""ARISE"", it ends with E? ARISE -> A R I S E -> yes. Similarly, ARGUE -> A R G U E -> ends with E? Yes.\n\nBut let\'s check: ARISE: positions: A(1), R(2), I(3), S(4), E(5). Is this possible? We know that A cannot be in position 3? Yes, but in this word A is in position 1, which is allowed. Also, we need to avoid C and N? This word doesn\'t have C or N.\n\nSimilarly, we have ""ARGUE"": A R G U E.\n\nBut note: in our first guess, we had E at position 5 and we got an E(✓), so that\'s fixed.\n\nWhat about the A: we had an A in position 3? No, in ""crane"": C R A N E -> A was in position 3 and we got ""-"", meaning A is not in position 3 in the secret word. So if we put A in position 1 (like in ARISE) that\'s fine.\n\nBut there is another possibility: A in position 4: like ? R ? A E.\n\nWords like: GRAVE, TRACE? But TRACE has C? We cannot use C. TRACE has C? Yes, T R A C E -> that contains C. Since C is not in the word, we cannot use words with C.\n\nSimilarly, we must avoid N.\n\nPossible words with A in position 4: BRADE? Not a word. GRADE? G R A D E -> A is in position 3? Not position 4. Position 4 would be D? So GRADE -> G R A D E: A is at position 3.\n\nWe need A at position 4: for example, BRAKE? B R A K E -> A is at position 3 again. Position 1: B, 2: R, 3: A, 4: K, 5: E. But we cannot have A at position 3 because of the feedback. The secret word does not have A at position 3? Yes, because when we guessed CRANE with A at 3, it was misplaced.\n\nSo BRAKE has A at position 3, which is forbidden? Meaning, if the word had A at position 3, we would have gotten a ""✓"", but we didn\'t. So we must avoid putting A at position 3.\n\nTherefore, words like BRAKE have A at position 3 and are invalid for the secret word.\n\nSo, what are words that end with E, have R at position 2, and have A at position 4? Structure: _ R _ A E\n\nExamples: GRAVE? G R A V E -> A at 3? No. Position: G(1), R(2), A(3), V(4), E(5). That\'s A at 3. Not good.\n\nWe need A at position 4: so position 4 is A, and position 5 is E. So the word must end with ""AE""? But AE is not common.\n\nActually, position 4 is A, position 5 is E: so the last two letters are AE? Like in UKRAINE? But that\'s 7 letters.\n\nFor 5 letters? Words ending with AE? In English, it\'s rare. Maybe ""PRAXE"" but not a word. We need common words.\n\nAnother option: the A is in position 1: so words starting with A and ending with E, R at position 2.\n\nCommon: ARISE, ARGUE, ABASE, ABATE, ADORE, etc.\n\nNow, back to option with A at position 4: What about ""FRAUD"" but doesn\'t end with E. Or ""GRAZE""? G R A Z E? Position 1:G, 2:R, 3:A, 4:Z, 5:E -> A at 3.\n\nI can\'t think of many words with A at position 4 and E at 5? Because A at 4 and E at 5 implies the last two are ""AE"", which isn\'t typical in English. There might be words like ""URAE"" but that\'s too short.\n\nPerhaps there are words where position 4 is A and 5 is E? For example: ""ROUE""? No, that\'s R O U E -> 4 letters.\n\n5-letter words: are there any that end with ""R A E""? No. The word ends with E? Yes. Actually, the structure is _ R _ A E. So the last three characters are A E? Not possible? Because position 5 is E, and position 4 is A? Then it ends with AE? Words ending with AE: often from Greek or Latin roots like ""abscissae"" but that\'s 9 letters. There might be rare ones, but let\'s assume the secret word is common.\n\nGiven the difficulty, perhaps A is at position 1? That seems more likely.\n\nAlso, note that in the first guess, we had E in position 5 and got ""in the word and correct"", so we can be sure about E at the end.\n\nThe feedback for A: it was in position 3 of our guess and was misplaced. So A is in the word, not at position 3.\n\nTherefore, A must be at position 1 or 4 (since position 2 is R and 5 is E, so only positions 1 or 4 are available). Position 4: because the word is 5 letters? Positions: 1,2,3,4,5.\n\nPosition 2 is fixed R, position 5 fixed E. Position 3: we know A is not there. So A can be in position 1 or 4.\n\nHowever, if A is at position 4, then the word ends with AE? That\'s rare. So position 1 might be more common.\n\nBut wait, there is also the possibility that the word has more than one A? But we don\'t know.\n\nFor now, let\'s assume A is at position 1. Then we can try a word like ARISE.\n\nARISE: A at 1, R at 2, I at 3, S at 4, E at 5.\n\nBut we must check if this word contains letters we know are not there? It has no C or N? Yes: A,R,I,S,E. C? No. N? No.\n\nSo ARISE is a valid guess.\n\nMoreover, it includes new letters: I and S.\n\nAlternatively, we could try a word that tests A at position 4? But if we try to put A at position 4, we might guess a word that has A in both? But we don\'t know.\n\nAnother idea: since we are not sure where A is, we can choose a word that has A in a different position? But the feedback implies it must be in 1 or 4. Also, we are forced because the positions 1 and 4 are open.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to include other occurrences of A? The feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicates. So we could ask: is it possible the word has A at position 1 and also elsewhere? Or at position 4 and elsewhere? We don\'t know.\n\nFor now, let\'s try to confirm the position.\n\nBut since we have only 6 tries, we should choose a word that can test multiple possibilities.\n\nPerhaps we can choose a word that has A at either position 1 or 4? But we can\'t put both? Unless duplicates.\n\nBut let\'s list possibilities.\n\nFirst, for A at position 1: we\'ll get an A in the guess at position 1? And if it\'s correct, we get a ✓. Otherwise, we\'ll get - or x. Since we are guessing it at position 1, if it\'s actually at position 1 we get ✓; if at position 4 we get - (if included) or x if not present? But we know it is present.\n\nBut in a guess of ARISE: if A is at position 1, then A(✓); if not, but A is in the word (at position 4), then we might get - for A? But in position 1, if A is not there? Then we\'d get x? But from the feedback we know A is present? Actually, regardless of position, if A is in the word, wherever we put it? But let\'s recall:\n\nIn the feedback, each letter gets a symbol based on its occurrence. If the secret word has A in it (at least one), then the A in our guess would get a ✓ if it\'s at the same position? Or a - if it\'s at a different position? Unless the secret had multiple A and one matched? That complicates.\n\nBut in this case, if we guess ARISE and the secret word has A at position 4? Then we would get:\n- A: since we put at position 1, and secret has A only at position 4? Then we get a ""-"" for A, meaning it\'s present but not at position 1? And the S? Then feedback would be: A(-), R(✓), I(...), S(...), E(✓).\n\nSimilarly, if the secret word has A at position 1, we get A(✓), R(✓), etc.\n\nSo by guessing ARISE, we can verify if A is at position 1 or not? Well, if the secret is ARISE, we win. Otherwise, if we get R(✓) and E(✓) and A gets ✓, then we\'ve confirmed position 1.\n\nIf A gets -, then we know A is not at position 1? So it must be at position 4? Because those are the only two options.\n\nEarlier we thought A must be in 1 or 4? Is that true? What about multiple letters?\n\nExample: the secret word might have A in position 1 and 3? But no, because we guessed A at position 3? And it was missing? If the secret had A at position 3, we would have gotten a ✓? Because CRANE had A at position 3? But we got a ""-"", meaning not ✓? So no, the secret does not have any A at position 3? So it\'s not at position 3? But if it had two A\'s? One at 1 and another at 3? Then when we guessed CRANE: C at 1? Got x because C is not there? But R at 2? ✓, A at 3: since there\'s an A at position 3? We should get ✓? But we got ""-"" meaning? Wordle\'s feedback: if the secret has duplicate letters, and you guess one? The feedback prioritizes exact matches first? Then any misplaced? But in any case, when we guessed CRANE with A at position 3:\n\nScenario 1: secret has A at position 3: then we get ✓ at position 3.\n\nScenario 2: secret has A not at position 3? But elsewhere: then we get -.\n\nSince we got -, that indicates that there is an A in the secret? But not at position 3? So any A at other positions? So it\'s possible to have A at position 1 or 4? Or even position 2 but position 2 is R? So position 2 is fixed as R? Which is not A? So A can only be at position 1 or 4? Or even if duplicate? But not at 3.\n\nSo if we guess ARISE:\n\n- If the secret has A at position 1: then A in our guess (position 1) gets ✓.\n- If the secret has A only at position 4, then A at position 1 gets ""-"" because it\'s present but at wrong place? Because we didn\'t guess A at position 4 yet? But it will register it? Unless the secret had multiple A? But again, when we guessed CRANE, one A was guessed? And only one ""-"" for A? Meaning? Possibly the secret has exactly one A? Or at least one? But not at position 3? So if we guess ARISE and the secret has A at position 4 only? Then the A at position 1 of our guess will trigger a ""-"" for A? Because it\'s present elsewhere? But it doesn\'t affect other letters? Except that the ""-"" counts per letter? Typically per occurrence? Wordle handles duplicates: if the secret has one A and you guess two? Then only one will be marked? But in this case, our guess has one A? So:\n\nGuess: A R I S E\n\nSecret: _ R ? A E? Then:\n- Position 1: A? But secret has A at position 4? And not at position 1? Then A gets ""-""?\n- R is at position 2? And we know R is ✓?\n- I? Unknown?\n- S: unknown?\n- E: ✓ at 5.\n\nSimilarly, if secret had A at position 1 and position 4? Then we get ✓ at position 1? And the A at position 4 does not matter? But we didn\'t guess position 4? So feedback would show A at position 1: ✓? Since it\'s exact? And the other A at position 4 might not be reflected? So we don\'t know if there is another A? Anyway, that\'s fine? Because we want to find the word.\n\nSo by guessing ARISE, we get to know about position 1 for A? And the other letters I and S.\n\nMoreover, ARISE is a common word? Yes.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ARISE.\n\nBut let\'s think of other options? What about ""ARGUE""? Without N and C.\n\nARISE covers I and S, which are common letters? That\'s good? For information gathering.\n\nAfter this guess, we\'ll know more about positions.\n\nTherefore, my second guess is ARISE.Based on the feedback from the previous guess ""crane"" (C not in word, R correct position, A in word but wrong position, N not in word, E correct position), we know:\n- The secret word has R as the second letter.\n- The secret word has E as the fifth letter.\n- The secret word contains A, but not in the third position (since it was misplaced there).\n- The secret word does not contain C or N.\n\nGiven that R is fixed at position 2 and E is fixed at position 5, the word pattern is: _ R _ _ E  \nAdditionally, A must be in the word but not at position 3. Since positions 1 and 4 are the only available slots (position 2 is R and position 5 is E), A must be at position 1 or 4.\n\nTo test this, ""arise"" is a strong second guess:\n- It places A at position 1 to check if it belongs there.\n- It introduces new common letters (I and S) to gather more information.\n- It avoids forbidden letters (C and N).\n- If A is at position 1, feedback will confirm it with ✓. If A is at position 4, feedback may show A as misplaced (-), and the word will still fit the pattern.\n\n<guess>arise</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: arise -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(✓) I(x) S(x) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"": C(x), R(✓), A(-), N(x), E(✓)
   Interpretation: 
     - R is in the word and in the correct position (2nd).
     - E is in the word and in the correct position (5th).
     - A is in the word but not at position 3 (since it was guessed at position 3).
     - C and N are not in the word.

2. ""arise"": A(✓), R(✓), I(x), S(x), E(✓)
   Interpretation:
     - A is in the word and in the correct position (1st). This means A is the first letter.
     - R (2nd) and E (5th) are confirmed correct, as before.
     - I and S are not in the word.

Combining this information:
- Secret word pattern: A R _ _ E
- Confirmed letters: A (1st), R (2nd), E (5th)
- Confirmed absent letters: C, N, I, S

Now, we need to fill the 3rd and 4th positions with letters that are not C, N, I, S, and form a valid English word.

Possible letters: Since C, N, I, S are out, we consider other common consonants and vowels. The word must be 5 letters: A R ? ? E

We need to try a word that fits this pattern and uses letters that might reveal information.

But note: We have only 6 tries, and this is our third guess. We have 4 letters fixed: A, R, E at positions 1,2,5, and S?, I? are not in word? So position 3 and 4 are unknown? And we must avoid C, N, I, S.

So what are possible English words with pattern A R _ _ E?

Let me think of common words:
- ARGUE: A R G U E -> G and U. Are G and U possible? We haven't eliminated them.
- ABOVE: A B O V E? No, no R at position 2. This is A R ? ? E, so positions: 1:A, 2:R, 3:?,4:?,5:E.

Possible words:
- ARGUE: positions: A(1),R(2),G(3),U(4),E(5)
- ARISE: but we guessed that and got I and S absent, so it must be a different word? And ARISE has S at 4? But we know S is absent, so not ARISE? Exactly, we already got S(x) in guess 2.
- ARDOR: but ends with R? Not E? ""ARDOR"" -> no E? And not ending with E.
- Other words: AROSE? A R O S E -> but S is absent? So no.
- ALONE: A L O N E? But N is absent? That's invalid.

Back to ""ARGUE"": if we guess it with G and U? Then we can test those letters.

Other possibilities:
- ARTIE? Not a word? Usually ""ARTIE"" is not a word? More likely ""ARETE""? Too rare.
- ARGLE? Not a word.
- ARRAY? Not ending with E.
- ABASE? A B A S E? But S is absent? So position 4 cannot be S? Also, has A twice? But we have A at 1? And we know no extra information about duplicates? But S is absent? So not.

Possible words: ARGUE, ARBRE? But not English? After research? Common words: 
- ""ARGUE"": A R G U E -> ends with E? Yes. Letters: G and U?
- ""AROME""? Not a common word? Typically ""aroma"" ends with A? Not E.
- ""AZURE"": A Z U R E? But R is at position 4? Then pattern would be A Z U R E? Not matching A R _ _ E? Because here R is at position 4? Where as we need R at position 2? So no: ""azure"" is A(1) Z(2) U(3) R(4) E(5)? So R is at 4? Not 2? So it doesn't match.
- ""AVOID"": doesn't end with E.

Another common word: A R E T E? But it's rare? ""arete"" is a word? A R E T E? Six letters? Wait, no: ""arete"" is 5? But also: A R E E T? Let's spell: ""arete"" is A R E T E? Then positions: 1:A, 2:R, 3:E, 4:T, 5:E. So yes? It ends with E? And pattern A R _ _ E? With T at position 4? And E at position 3? But note: in our pattern, E is at position 5? So word is A R E T E? Which has E at positions 3 and 5? But that's possible? And no conflict? We must avoid S,I? So no problem? But also C,N? Removed.

But we are not required that every letter be unique.

So possible: ""arete""? But let me confirm: it's an English word meaning a sharp mountain ridge? Valid? Perhaps? But let's see if it's common in Wordle list? Alternatively, we might choose a more common word.

Another possibility: ""abate""? But A B A T E? Positions: A(1),B(2)? But R is at position 2? No? We require R at position 2 exactly? So B would be at position 2? But we have R at position 2? So no: pattern is A R _ _ E? So position 2 is R? Fixed.

So ""ABATE"" -> A B A T E? Position 2 is B? Not R? Incorrect pattern.

Another word: A R O S E? But ""arose"" has S? Which is absent? So not.

Perhaps ""ARGUE"" and ""ARETE"" are both options? But ""ARETE"" has E at position 3? And ""ARGUE"" has G and U.

But note: we have E at position 5? But E could be duplicated? We don't know? Because in ""crane"", E was at position 5? And was correct? But that doesn't prevent E elsewhere? So E could be at position 3? As in ""ARETE""? Yes.

Also, ""ARQUE"": not English.

I think ""ARGUE"" is a good candidate? Because it uses common letters? And we can test G and U? Or ""AROSE"": but S is out? So no? S is absent? So cannot use.

Similarly, ""ARISE"": we tried? So not.

Another common word: ""ALIKE""? But position 2 is L? Not R? Incorrect pattern.

So only few options.
- ""ARGUE""
- ""ARETE"": but let me confirm spelling: A-R-E-T-E? 5 letters? Yes.
- ""AMBLE"": A M B L E? Position 2 is M? Not R? No.

What about ""ABORE""? Not a word? Better to list possibilities.

Since we need to test position 3 and 4, and we have free? Letters not C,N,I,S? Which letters remain?

We could choose a word that tests multiple common letters? But we are constrained by the pattern A R _ _ E.

We might guess ""argue"" to test U and G? Yes.

If we guess ""argue"" and it's not the word? Then we get feedback.

But also, we might solve if we are lucky? But not necessarily.

Another option: ""azure""? But as above? Doesn't fit? Because position 4? R? Not matched.

So I think ""ARGUE"" is a valid guess? With G and U.

And no C,N,I,S? Correct.

Also, note: we haven't eliminated G or U? So any letter not known absent? We can use.

Therefore, let's guess ""argue"" as the third word.

But why not ""arete""? ""arete"" is less common? But may be in the word list? However, Wordle has ""arete"" as possible? So we should consider it.

But if we guess ""ARGUE"", if G and U are present, we'll know? Otherwise not.

Alternatively, to maximize information? Since we have positions 3 and 4 unknown? We could choose a word that uses common letters not yet tested? For example, B, D, G, K, L, M, T, U, etc? But we are forced to guess a word? And ""ARGUE"" uses G and U? Which are not in the previous absent list.

Now, if ""argue"" is guessed and:
- If G and U are both correct? Then we solve? Word is argue? But maybe not? Feedback will tell.

If not? We get information? For example, if G is absent? Then we know? Similarly U? Or misplaced.

But since the pattern is fixed: A R _ _ E? We just need to find the two letters? That match and form a word? So after this guess, we might be able to solve?

So ""ARGUE"" is a reasonable choice.

Therefore, third guess: argue.

But let me think of other words? Such as ""A R T E E""? Not a word? ""ARTIE"" might be? But often not in word list? Wordle might include ""ARXES""? Not.

Another word: ""ABLE"" too short? ""ABODE"": position 2? B? Not R.

I think ""ARGUE"" or ""ARETE"" are the main ones? But ""ARETE"" has T? And E? Which might be duplicated? But we know E? But E could be elsewhere? So it is possible? But ""ARETE"" uses E at position 3? Which we don't know about? So we can test.

But given commonality, ""argue"" is common? ""Arete"" less? So I'll choose ""argue"".

Then guess: argue.

But wait: ""ARISE"" was guessed? And gave I and S absent? So ""argue"" doesn't have I or S? So safe.

Similarly, no C,N? Yes.

So let's proceed.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- From Guess 1 (crane): C is not in the word, R is correct and in position 2, A is in the word but not in position 3, N is not in the word, E is correct and in position 5.
- From Guess 2 (arise): A is correct and in position 1, R is correct and in position 2, I is not in the word, S is not in the word, E is correct and in position 5.

### Key Insights:
1. **Fixed positions**: 
   - Position 1: A (confirmed ✓)
   - Position 2: R (confirmed ✓)
   - Position 5: E (confirmed ✓)
   - Therefore, the secret word pattern is **A R \_ \_ E**.

2. **Absent letters**:
   - C, N (from Guess 1)
   - I, S (from Guess 2)
   - These letters **cannot appear** in the word.

3. **Remaining slots**: 
   - Positions 3 and 4 are unknown and must be filled with letters that are not C, N, I, or S.

4. **Possible word**: 
   - The word ""argue"" fits the pattern A R \_ \_ E:
     - Letters: A, R, G, U, E
     - Avoids absent letters (C, N, I, S).
     - Tests new common letters (G and U) to gather more information about positions 3 and 4.

If ""argue"" is correct:
- If both G and U match, we solve the word immediately.
- If there are mismatches, we gain valuable feedback to constrain the possibilities further.

Thus, ""argue"" is a strong third guess.

<guess>argue</guess>",argue,"We are given feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"": C(x), R(✓), A(-), N(x), E(✓)

- ""AZURE"": A Z U R E? But R is at position 4? Then pattern would be A Z U R E? Not matching A R _ _ E? Because here R is at position 4? Where as we need R at position 2? So no: ""azure"" is A(1) Z(2) U(3) R(4) E(5)? So R is at 4? Not 2? So it doesn't match.
- ""AVOID"": doesn't end with E.

Another common word: A R E T E? But it's rare? ""arete"" is a word? A R E T E? Six letters? Wait, no: ""arete"" is 5? But also: A R E E T? Let's spell: ""arete"" is A R E T E? Then positions: 1:A, 2:R, 3:E, 4:T, 5:E. So yes? It ends with E? And pattern A R _ _ E? With T at position 4? And E at position 3? But note: in our pattern, E is at position 5? So word is A R E T E? Which has E at positions 3 and 5? But that's possible? And no conflict? We must avoid S,I? So no problem? But also C,N? Removed.

But we are not required that every letter be unique.

So possible: ""arete""? But let me confirm: it's an English word meaning a sharp mountain ridge? Valid? Perhaps? But let's see if it's common in Wordle list? Alternatively, we might choose a more common word.

Another possibility: ""abate""? But A B A T E? Positions: A(1),B(2)? But R is at position 2? No? We require R at position 2 exactly? So B would be at position 2? But we have R at position 2? So no: pattern is A R _ _ E? So position 2 is R? Fixed.

So ""ABATE"" -> A B A T E? Position 2 is B? Not R? Incorrect pattern.

Another word: A R O S E? But ""arose"" has S? Which is absent? So not.

Perhaps ""ARGUE"" and ""ARETE"" are both options? But ""ARETE"" has E at position 3? And ""ARGUE"" has G and U.

But note: we have E at position 5? But E could be duplicated? We don't know? Because in ""crane"", E was at position 5? And was correct? But that doesn't prevent E elsewhere? So E could be at position 3? As in ""ARETE""? Yes.

Also, ""ARQUE"": not English.

I think ""ARGUE"" is a good candidate? Because it uses common letters? And we can test G and U? Or ""AROSE"": but S is out? So no? S is absent? So cannot use.

Similarly, ""ARISE"": we tried? So not.

Another common word: ""ALIKE""? But position 2 is L? Not R? Incorrect pattern.

So only few options.
- ""ARGUE""
- ""ARETE"": but let me confirm spelling: A-R-E-T-E? 5 letters? Yes.
- ""AMBLE"": A M B L E? Position 2 is M? Not R? No.

What about ""ABORE""? Not a word? Better to list possibilities.

Since we need to test position 3 and 4, and we have free? Letters not C,N,I,S? Which letters remain?

We could choose a word that tests multiple common letters? But we are constrained by the pattern A R _ _ E.

We might guess ""argue"" to test U and G? Yes.

If we guess ""argue"" and it's not the word? Then we get feedback.

But also, we might solve if we are lucky? But not necessarily.

Another option: ""azure""? But as above? Doesn't fit? Because position 4? R? Not matched.

So I think ""ARGUE"" is a valid guess? With G and U.

And no C,N,I,S? Correct.

Also, note: we haven't eliminated G or U? So any letter not known absent? We can use.

Therefore, let's guess ""argue"" as the third word.

But why not ""arete""? ""arete"" is less common? But may be in the word list? However, Wordle has ""arete"" as possible? So we should consider it.

But if we guess ""ARGUE"", if G and U are present, we'll know? Otherwise not.

Alternatively, to maximize information? Since we have positions 3 and 4 unknown? We could choose a word that uses common letters not yet tested? For example, B, D, G, K, L, M, T, U, etc? But we are forced to guess a word? And ""ARGUE"" uses G and U? Which are not in the previous absent list.

Now, if ""argue"" is guessed and:
- If G and U are both correct? Then we solve? Word is argue? But maybe not? Feedback will tell.

If not? We get information? For example, if G is absent? Then we know? Similarly U? Or misplaced.

But since the pattern is fixed: A R _ _ E? We just need to find the two letters? That match and form a word? So after this guess, we might be able to solve?

So ""ARGUE"" is a reasonable choice.

Therefore, third guess: argue.

But let me think of other words? Such as ""A R T E E""? Not a word? ""ARTIE"" might be? But often not in word list? Wordle might include ""ARXES""? Not.

Another word: ""ABLE"" too short? ""ABODE"": position 2? B? Not R.

I think ""ARGUE"" or ""ARETE"" are the main ones? But ""ARETE"" has T? And E? Which might be duplicated? But we know E? But E could be elsewhere? So it is possible? But ""ARETE"" uses E at position 3? Which we don't know about? So we can test.

But given commonality, ""argue"" is common? ""Arete"" less? So I'll choose ""argue"".

Then guess: argue.

But wait: ""ARISE"" was guessed? And gave I and S absent? So ""argue"" doesn't have I or S? So safe.

Similarly, no C,N? Yes.

So let's proceed.Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- From Guess 1 (crane): C is not in the word, R is correct and in position 2, A is in the word but not in position 3, N is not in the word, E is correct and in position 5.
- From Guess 2 (arise): A is correct and in position 1, R is correct and in position 2, I is not in the word, S is not in the word, E is correct and in position 5.

### Key Insights:
1. **Fixed positions**: 
   - Position 1: A (confirmed ✓)
   - Position 2: R (confirmed ✓)
   - Position 5: E (confirmed ✓)
   - Therefore, the secret word pattern is **A R \_ \_ E**.

2. **Absent letters**:
   - C, N (from Guess 1)
   - I, S (from Guess 2)
   - These letters **cannot appear** in the word.

3. **Remaining slots**: 
   - Positions 3 and 4 are unknown and must be filled with letters that are not C, N, I, or S.

4. **Possible word**: 
   - The word ""argue"" fits the pattern A R \_ \_ E:
     - Letters: A, R, G, U, E
     - Avoids absent letters (C, N, I, S).
     - Tests new common letters (G and U) to gather more information about positions 3 and 4.

If ""argue"" is correct:
- If both G and U match, we solve the word immediately.
- If there are mismatches, we gain valuable feedback to constrain the possibilities further.

Thus, ""argue"" is a strong third guess.",Guess 3: argue -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(✓) G(✓) U(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
