 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all are distinct.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the secret word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the secret word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R, A, and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
 - The secret word does not contain C or N.

 Since R, A, and E are in the word, we should try to use them again in different positions.

 Also, note that in ""crane"", the positions were:
  1: C (x)
  2: R (but should be elsewhere) -> so R cannot be in position 2
  3: A (but should be elsewhere) -> so A cannot be in position 3
  4: N (x)
  5: E (but should be elsewhere) -> so E cannot be in position 5

 We have 6 tries, so we can use a second guess to test new positions for R, A, E and also try to include other common letters.

 We must avoid using C and N.

 Let's think of a word that includes R, A, E and two new letters (preferably common ones) and places R, A, E in positions different from the first guess.

 Constraints for the next guess:
  - Avoid position 2 for R, position 3 for A, position 5 for E.
  - The word must not contain C or N.

 We can try to put R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: we know R is in the word but not in position 2. Similarly, A not in 3, E not in 5.

 However, we don't know the exact positions yet.

 Let's try to form a word that has:
  - R in a new position (say position 1 or 4 or 5? but note we have to avoid position 2)
  - A in a new position (not 3, so 1,2,4,5)
  - E in a new position (not 5, so 1,2,3,4)

 Also, we want to test new letters. Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, etc.

 We can try a word that starts with R? But note: we don't know if R is at the beginning.

 Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has R, A, E and two new letters.

 Example words: 
  ""RAISE"" - but note: 
    R at position 1 (which is new for R, since previously it was at 2) -> allowed
    A at position 2 (previously at 3, so 2 is new) -> allowed
    I is new
    S is new
    E at position 5 -> but feedback said E is not in position 5? Actually, the feedback for E was that it is in the word but not in position 5. So we cannot put E at position 5 again? Actually, we can, but we know it's not correct because the feedback said it's not in position 5. So we should avoid putting E at position 5.

 Therefore, ""RAISE"" has E at position 5, which we know is wrong. So we avoid that.

 Another word: ""ROATE"" (a valid word? yes, meaning to grow or increase) but:
  R at 1 -> new
  O at 2 -> new
  A at 3 -> but we know A is not at position 3? Actually, the feedback for A was that it is in the word but not at position 3. So we cannot put A at 3 again? We can, but we know it's not the correct position. However, we are trying to test new positions. Also, E is at 5 again, which we know is wrong.

 So avoid ""ROATE"" for the same reason.

 Let's try ""STARE"":
  S at 1 -> new
  T at 2 -> new
  A at 3 -> but we know A is not at 3? So we shouldn't put A at 3? Actually, we can put it to test, but we already know it's not the correct position. However, we are trying to get new information. But we have to avoid known wrong positions? Actually, we can put a letter in a known wrong position again? But that would be inefficient because we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting A at position 3.

 Therefore, we need a word that has:
  R not at 2
  A not at 3
  E not at 5

 And we want to test new letters.

 Let me try ""LATER"":
  L at 1 -> new
  A at 2 -> new position for A (previously at 3, now at 2) -> allowed
  T at 3 -> new
  E at 4 -> new position for E (previously at 5, now at 4) -> allowed
  R at 5 -> new position for R (previously at 2, now at 5) -> allowed

 This word uses L and T as new letters, and places A, E, R in positions that are not the ones we know are wrong.

 Also, we avoid C and N.

 So ""LATER"" is a good candidate.

 But note: we have to make sure it's a valid word.

 Alternatively, ""RATEL"" (a honey badger) but that might be less common.

 Another common word: ""ALTER"" - similar to ""LATER"", but with A at 1 and L at 2? But then A is at 1, which is new.

 However, let's stick with ""LATER"".

 But wait: we have to consider that the secret word has R, A, E. In ""LATER"", we have:
  L (new), A (known, at position 2), T (new), E (known, at position 4), R (known, at position 5).

 This covers two new letters and repositions the known letters.

 Alternatively, we can try ""TARES"" (a valid word, meaning weed or a unit of weight) but that has 5 letters? T-A-R-E-S.

  T at 1 -> new
  A at 2 -> new for A (previously at 3, now at 2) -> allowed
  R at 3 -> but we know R is not at position 2? But position 3 is new for R. However, we don't have a constraint on R at 3? Only that it's not at 2. So R at 3 is allowed.
  E at 4 -> new for E (previously at 5, now at 4) -> allowed
  S at 5 -> new

 This also seems good.

 But note: we have two known letters (A and R) in positions we haven't tested? Actually, we are testing new positions.

 However, we have to choose one.

 Let me compare:
  ""LATER"": tests L and T, and positions 2 for A, 4 for E, 5 for R.
  ""TARES"": tests T, S, and positions 2 for A, 3 for R, 4 for E.

 We might get more information from ""TARES"" because it has S at the end, which is a common letter.

 But note: we are limited by the fact that we know the word has R, A, E and two other letters (which are not C or N).

 I think both are valid. Let's choose ""TARES"" because it has more common letters? Or because it tests R in a new position (3) and we haven't tested that.

 Alternatively, we can choose ""STARE"" but then A is at 3 which we know is wrong? So we avoid that.

 Actually, we can adjust ""STARE"" to avoid A at 3? But we can't because the word is fixed.

 So let's go with ""TARES"".

 But note: the feedback for the first guess had R at position 2 as wrong, but that doesn't mean R cannot be at other positions? We are free to test.

 However, we are trying to maximize information.

 Another candidate: ""ARISE"" - but E is at 5 again? So avoid.

 How about ""RAISE"" but E at 5? Avoid.

 How about ""SERAI"" (an inn) but that might be too obscure.

 Let me stick with ""TARES"".

 But wait, what about ""REACT""? But we know C is not in the word, so we cannot use C.

 So ""TARES"" is valid.

 Alternatively, ""PARSE"": 
  P at 1 -> new
  A at 2 -> new for A (allowed)
  R at 3 -> new for R (allowed)
  S at 4 -> new
  E at 5 -> but we know E is not at 5? So avoid.

 Therefore, ""TARES"" seems good.

 But note: we have to make sure that the word is in the word list. Since the game uses valid English words, and ""tares"" is a valid word, we can use it.

 So second guess: ""TARES""

<guess>tares</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C** and **N** are absent from the secret word (marked `x`).
- **R**, **A**, and **E** are present but in incorrect positions (marked `-`). Specifically:
  - R cannot be in position 2.
  - A cannot be in position 3.
  - E cannot be in position 5.

For the next guess, I prioritized:
1. **Including known letters (R, A, E)** in new positions to test their correct placement.
2. **Avoiding C and N**.
3. **Introducing new common letters** (T, S) to maximize information.
4. **Avoiding positions ruled out** by the first guess.

The word **""tares""** fits these criteria:
- Places A in position 2 (new, not position 3).
- Places R in position 3 (new, not position 2).
- Places E in position 4 (new, not position 5).
- Introduces T (position 1) and S (position 5), both untested letters.
- Is a valid 5-letter English word.

This guess efficiently tests new positions for known letters and explores new letters to narrow down possibilities.

 Also, we want to test new letters. Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, etc.

 We can try a word that starts with R? But note: we don't know if R is at the beginning.

 Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has R, A, E and two new letters.

 Example words: 
  ""RAISE"" - but note: 
    R at position 1 (which is new for R, since previously it was at 2) -> allowed
    A at position 2 (previously at 3, so 2 is new) -> allowed
    I is new
    S is new
    E at position 5 -> but feedback said E is not in position 5? Actually, the feedback for E was that it is in the word but not in position 5. So we cannot put E at position 5 again? Actually, we can, but we know it's not correct because the feedback said it's not in position 5. So we should avoid putting E at position 5.

 Therefore, ""RAISE"" has E at position 5, which we know is wrong. So we avoid that.

 Another word: ""ROATE"" (a valid word? yes, meaning to grow or increase) but:
  R at 1 -> new
  O at 2 -> new
  A at 3 -> but we know A is not at position 3? Actually, the feedback for A was that it is in the word but not at position 3. So we cannot put A at 3 again? We can, but we know it's not the correct position. However, we are trying to test new positions. Also, E is at 5 again, which we know is wrong.

 So avoid ""ROATE"" for the same reason.

 Let's try ""STARE"":
  S at 1 -> new
  T at 2 -> new
  A at 3 -> but we know A is not at 3? So we shouldn't put A at 3? Actually, we can put it to test, but we already know it's not the correct position. However, we are trying to get new information. But we have to avoid known wrong positions? Actually, we can put a letter in a known wrong position again? But that would be inefficient because we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting A at position 3.

 Therefore, we need a word that has:
  R not at 2
  A not at 3
  E not at 5

 And we want to test new letters.

 Let me try ""LATER"":
  L at 1 -> new
  A at 2 -> new position for A (previously at 3, now at 2) -> allowed
  T at 3 -> new
  E at 4 -> new position for E (previously at 5, now at 4) -> allowed
  R at 5 -> new position for R (previously at 2, now at 5) -> allowed

 This word uses L and T as new letters, and places A, E, R in positions that are not the ones we know are wrong.

 Also, we avoid C and N.

 So ""LATER"" is a good candidate.

 But note: we have to make sure it's a valid word.

 Alternatively, ""RATEL"" (a honey badger) but that might be less common.

 Another common word: ""ALTER"" - similar to ""LATER"", but with A at 1 and L at 2? But then A is at 1, which is new.

 However, let's stick with ""LATER"".

 But wait: we have to consider that the secret word has R, A, E. In ""LATER"", we have:
  L (new), A (known, at position 2), T (new), E (known, at position 4), R (known, at position 5).

 This covers two new letters and repositions the known letters.

 Alternatively, we can try ""TARES"" (a valid word, meaning weed or a unit of weight) but that has 5 letters? T-A-R-E-S.

  T at 1 -> new
  A at 2 -> new for A (previously at 3, now at 2) -> allowed
  R at 3 -> but we know R is not at position 2? But position 3 is new for R. However, we don't have a constraint on R at 3? Only that it's not at 2. So R at 3 is allowed.
  E at 4 -> new for E (previously at 5, now at 4) -> allowed
  S at 5 -> new

 This also seems good.

 But note: we have two known letters (A and R) in positions we haven't tested? Actually, we are testing new positions.

 However, we have to choose one.

 Let me compare:
  ""LATER"": tests L and T, and positions 2 for A, 4 for E, 5 for R.
  ""TARES"": tests T, S, and positions 2 for A, 3 for R, 4 for E.

 We might get more information from ""TARES"" because it has S at the end, which is a common letter.

 But note: we are limited by the fact that we know the word has R, A, E and two other letters (which are not C or N).

 I think both are valid. Let's choose ""TARES"" because it has more common letters? Or because it tests R in a new position (3) and we haven't tested that.

 Alternatively, we can choose ""STARE"" but then A is at 3 which we know is wrong? So we avoid that.

 Actually, we can adjust ""STARE"" to avoid A at 3? But we can't because the word is fixed.

 So let's go with ""TARES"".

 But note: the feedback for the first guess had R at position 2 as wrong, but that doesn't mean R cannot be at other positions? We are free to test.

 However, we are trying to maximize information.

 Another candidate: ""ARISE"" - but E is at 5 again? So avoid.

 How about ""RAISE"" but E at 5? Avoid.

 How about ""SERAI"" (an inn) but that might be too obscure.

 Let me stick with ""TARES"".

 But wait, what about ""REACT""? But we know C is not in the word, so we cannot use C.

 So ""TARES"" is valid.

 Alternatively, ""PARSE"": 
  P at 1 -> new
  A at 2 -> new for A (allowed)
  R at 3 -> new for R (allowed)
  S at 4 -> new
  E at 5 -> but we know E is not at 5? So avoid.

 Therefore, ""TARES"" seems good.

 But note: we have to make sure that the word is in the word list. Since the game uses valid English words, and ""tares"" is a valid word, we can use it.

 So second guess: ""TARES""

<guess>tares</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C** and **N** are absent from the secret word (marked `x`).
- **R**, **A**, and **E** are present but in incorrect positions (marked `-`). Specifically:
  - R cannot be in position 2.
  - A cannot be in position 3.
  - E cannot be in position 5.

For the next guess, I prioritized:
1. **Including known letters (R, A, E)** in new positions to test their correct placement.
2. **Avoiding C and N**.
3. **Introducing new common letters** (T, S) to maximize information.
4. **Avoiding positions ruled out** by the first guess.

The word **""tares""** fits these criteria:
- Places A in position 2 (new, not position 3).
- Places R in position 3 (new, not position 2).
- Places E in position 4 (new, not position 5).
- Introduces T (position 1) and S (position 5), both untested letters.
- Is a valid 5-letter English word.

This guess efficiently tests new positions for known letters and explores new letters to narrow down possibilities.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but not in position 5)

Guess 2: ""tares""
- T: ✓ (correct, in position 1)
- A: ✓ (correct, in position 2)
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
- E: ✓ (correct, in position 4)
- S: x (not in the word)

So, from this, we know:

1. The first letter is T.
2. The second letter is A.
3. The fourth letter is E.
4. The letter R is in the word, but not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 3 (from second guess). Therefore, R must be in position 5 (since positions 1, 2, 3, and 4 are either taken or ruled out for R? But position 1 is T, position 2 is A, position 4 is E, and position 3 is not R. So the only position left is 5? But wait, the word has 5 letters, so position 5 is the only possibility? However, we must confirm: the secret word has R, and it cannot be in positions 2 or 3. Position 1 is T (so not R), position 2 is A (so not R), position 4 is E (so not R). Therefore, R must be in position 5.

But let's double-check: the feedback for ""tares"" has R marked as present but wrong position. In ""tares"", R is in position 3. Since we now know that position 3 is not R, and we also know from the first guess that position 2 is not R, and positions 1, 2, and 4 are fixed as T, A, E, then indeed R must be in position 5.

Additionally, we know that S is not in the word.

Also, from the first guess, we know that C and N are not in the word.

So, the secret word so far is: T A _ E _

And we know the fifth letter must be R? But wait, we have to confirm: the feedback for the second guess shows that R is present but not in position 3, and we have fixed positions 1,2,4. The only unknown position is 3 and 5. But position 5 is available. However, we must consider that the word might have more than one R? But the feedback doesn't indicate that. But it's possible. However, the feedback for ""crane"" had R in position 2 and it was marked as present (but wrong position). In ""tares"", R is in position 3 and marked as present (wrong position). So if R were in position 5, then in ""tares"", the R in position 3 would be an extra R? But the secret word might have only one R. However, we don't know for sure.

But let's think: if the secret word has R only in position 5, then in ""tares"", the R in position 3 would be an incorrect position (which it is, as per feedback) and the R in position 5 would be correct? But in ""tares"", we don't have a letter in position 5? ""tares"" is T-A-R-E-S, so position 5 is S. We don't have a letter in position 5 for R. So the feedback for R is only about the R in position 3. Therefore, the secret word has an R, but it's not in position 3. And we know it's not in position 2. And positions 1,2,4 are fixed as T,A,E. So the only position left is 5. Therefore, the fifth letter must be R.

But what about the third letter? We don't know it yet.

So the word is: T A ? E R

But wait, that would be five letters: position1: T, position2: A, position3: ?, position4: E, position5: R.

Now, we need to find the third letter.

We also know from the first guess that the word contains R, A, E (which we have) and we know C and N are not in the word. Also, S is not in the word (from second guess).

In the first guess, we had ""crane"" and we know that the secret word has R, A, E. Now we have T, A, E, R, and one missing letter in position 3.

What letters are possible for position 3?

We know the secret word does not contain: C, N, S (and also the letters that were not present in the feedback, but we don't have a full list).

From the two guesses, we have used: C, R, A, N, E, T, S.

We know C, N, S are absent.

The letter in position 3 must be a letter that is not C, N, S, and also not T, A, E, R? But T, A, E, R are already in the word, but they can be repeated? However, we don't have any indication of repeated letters so far.

But let's check: in the first guess, we had no repeated letters, and in the second guess, we had T, A, R, E, S (all distinct). The secret word: we have T, A, E, R and one more. If the secret word has no repeated letters, then the third letter must be a new letter that we haven't tried.

But we don't know if there are repeated letters. However, since we have no feedback indicating a repeated letter (for example, if a letter is repeated and one is correct and the other is not, it might show multiple marks), but in this case, we don't have that.

But to be safe, we should consider that the third letter could be a letter we haven't tried, or it could be one of the existing letters? But we have T, A, E, R already. If the third letter is one of these, then it would be a duplicate.

For example, if the third letter is T, then the word would be T A T E R. But that might be a valid word? ""tater"" (a potato). Similarly, if it's A, then ""taaer"" is not a word. If it's E, ""taeer"" not a word. If it's R, then ""tarer"" (one who tares) is a word? But let's see.

But we have to consider the feedback from the first guess. In ""crane"", we had A in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. But if the secret word has A in position 2 (which is fixed) and also in position 3? Then in ""crane"", the A in position 3 would be correct? But it was marked as wrong position. So that means the secret word does not have A in position 3, but it does have an A. Since we now know A is in position 2, then if there were a second A, it could be in position 3? But the feedback for ""crane"" would have marked the A as correct if it were in position 3? But it was marked as wrong position, meaning that the A is in the word but not in position 3. That doesn't preclude a second A? Actually, if there were two A's, and one is in position 2 (which we now know) and one in position 3, then in ""crane"", the A in position 3 would be correct and should be marked as correct (✓), but it was marked as wrong position (-). Therefore, the secret word does not have an A in position 3. So if the secret word has only one A, then we know that. Similarly, for other letters.

But in our case, for the third position, if we put A, it would be incorrect because we know A is in position 2 and the feedback from ""crane"" showed that position 3 is not A. Similarly, for T: in the first guess, we didn't have T. In the second guess, T is in position 1 and correct. If we put T in position 3, then the word would have two T's? But in the second guess, we only had one T and it was in position 1. The feedback didn't show any other T? The feedback for ""tares"" had T as correct in position 1, and the other letters: A correct, R wrong, E correct, S absent. There was no indication of another T? But if the secret word had a T in position 3, then in ""tares"", we only have one T (in position 1) and the secret word has two T's, so the feedback wouldn't show the second T because we didn't guess it. So it's possible.

Similarly for E: we have E in position 4. If we put E in position 3, then the word would be T A E E R. But in the first guess, we had E in position 5 and it was marked as wrong position. If the secret word has E in position 4 and also in position 3, then in ""crane"", the E in position 5 would be one of the E's? But the feedback marked it as wrong position, meaning that the E is in the word but not in position 5. It doesn't say anything about position 3. However, in the second guess, we have E in position 4 and it's correct. So if we put E in position 3, then the secret word has two E's. But we don't have feedback that rules that out.

Similarly for R: we think R is in position 5. If we put R in position 3, then the word would be T A R E R. But in the first guess, we had R in position 2 and it was marked as wrong position. If the secret word has R in position 3 and 5, then in ""crane"", the R in position 2 would be wrong, which is consistent. In ""tares"", we have R in position 3 and it was marked as wrong position? But if the secret word has R in position 3, then in ""tares"", the R in position 3 should be correct (✓), but it was marked as wrong position (-). Therefore, the secret word does not have R in position 3. So R cannot be in position 3.

Therefore, for position 3, we cannot have R (because of the feedback from ""tares"": R in position 3 is wrong). We cannot have A (because of feedback from ""crane"": A in position 3 is wrong). We cannot have T? We don't have direct feedback, but if we put T in position 3, it would be a duplicate. Similarly for E.

But duplicates are allowed? The word could have duplicate letters.

However, we have to consider the feedback.

Let me summarize the constraints for position 3:

- It cannot be C, N, S (absent letters).
- It cannot be A (because in ""crane"", A in position 3 was marked as wrong, and we now know A is in position 2, so if there were a second A, the feedback in ""crane"" would have shown it as correct? But wait, no: if there is a second A, and we guessed A in position 3, and the secret word has A in position 2 and 3, then the A in position 3 would be correct and should be marked as correct (✓). But in ""crane"", it was marked as wrong position (-). Therefore, the secret word does not have an A in position 3. So even if there is a second A, it cannot be in position 3. But we don't know if there is a second A. However, for position 3, we cannot put A because it would be incorrect (as per feedback).

Similarly, we cannot put R in position 3 because in ""tares"", R in position 3 was marked as wrong, meaning the secret word does not have R in position 3.

For T: we don't have any feedback that says T cannot be in position 3. Similarly for E.

But we also have to consider that the secret word might not have duplicate letters.

Given that, it might be more efficient to assume no duplicates for now and try a new letter.

But we have to consider all possibilities.

However, we have only 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We have 3 more after this? Actually, we have used 2, so we have 4 left? But we need to solve it.

The word is T A ? E R, and we need to find the missing letter.

Possible letters: any letter except C, N, S, and also excluding A and R for position 3 (as explained). But T and E are possible if duplicated.

But let's list possible words.

Common words that fit T A _ E R:

- TAPER (a candle or to narrow)
- TAMER (one who tames)
- TASER (a stun gun) but S is absent, so not possible.
- TAXER (one who taxes)
- TABER (a type of dance? not common)
- TAGER? not a word.
- TALER? a coin, but not common.
- TARER? but R is in position 5, and if we put R in position 3, we cannot because of feedback.

But we cannot have R in position 3.

Similarly, TATER (potato) - T A T E R, which has T in position 1 and 3.

Is that possible? Let's check against feedback.

First guess ""crane"": no T, so no issue.

Second guess ""tares"": we have T in position 1 (correct), A in 2 (correct), R in 3 (wrong), E in 4 (correct), S in 5 (absent). If the secret word is ""tater"", then:

- T in position 1: correct (matches)
- A in position 2: correct (matches)
- R in position 3: in ""tares"" we guessed R in 3, but in ""tater"" position 3 is T, not R. So R is not in position 3, which is consistent with the feedback (wrong position). But the secret word ""tater"" has R in position 5. In ""tares"", we did not guess any R in position 5? We guessed S in position 5. So the feedback for R: we have one R in the guess (position 3) and the secret word has one R (position 5). Since the positions are different, it should be marked as present but wrong position, which it was. Also, S is absent, which is correct.

So ""tater"" is a possible word.

Another possibility: ""taper"" - T A P E R.

Check against feedback:

First guess: no P, so no issue.

Second guess: ""tares"" vs ""taper"": 
- T: correct
- A: correct
- R: in ""tares"" we have R in 3, but in ""taper"" position 3 is P, not R. The R is in position 5. So the R in the guess (position 3) is not in the secret word at position 3, and the secret word has R in position 5. So the feedback should be R present but wrong position, which matches. S is absent, correct.

Similarly, ""tamer"": T A M E R.

Same logic: M is new, R in position 5.

Now, what about ""taxer"": T A X E R.

X is a letter.

But we need to see if it's valid.

Also, are there words with E in position 3? Like ""taeer"" is not a word. ""Taker"" would be T A K E R, but K is a letter.

""Taker"" is a word.

But let's list all possible common words:

- taper
- tamer
- taker
- taxer
- taber (less common)
- taler (less common)
- tater

But we need to figure out which one.

We have to make a guess that can distinguish these.

But we have only one letter missing, so we can try to guess one of these.

However, we have 4 more guesses, so we can try a word that includes several of the possible letters.

But note: we don't know the third letter, and we have multiple options.

We can use a guess that tests multiple possibilities.

But since we know the first, second, fourth, and fifth letters, and only the third is missing, we can try to guess one of the common ones.

But we have to be careful: if we guess wrong, we use a try.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has a new letter in position 3 and also includes other letters to test, but we already know four letters.

But we don't have to use the known letters? We can, but we can also use a word that has the known letters in the correct positions and a new letter in position 3.

But we don't have many letters left to test? We have used: C, R, A, N, E, T, S.

Absent: C, N, S.

Present: T, A, E, R, and one more.

The remaining letters are almost the entire alphabet minus a few.

But we can try a word that has T, A, E, R in the correct positions and a new letter in position 3.

But that's exactly what we are going to do: guess a word like ""taper"" or ""tamer"", etc.

But we need to choose one.

To maximize information, we might choose a word that has a common letter that appears in many possible words? But all are different.

Since we are not sure, we can choose a word that uses a letter we haven't tried, so that if it's wrong, we get information about that letter.

For example, if we guess ""taper"", and it's wrong, then we know P is not in the word, and then we can try another.

Similarly for ""tamer"", we test M.

But we have to start somewhere.

Let's see the frequency of letters. Common letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... but we have used E, T, A, R. N and S are out. So O, I, L, U, D, etc.

In the possible words:

- taper: P
- tamer: M
- taker: K
- taxer: X
- taber: B
- taler: L
- tater: T (duplicate)

T is already in the word, so ""tater"" has a duplicate T.

We can try ""tater"" first because it uses a letter we already know is present (T), so if it's wrong, we know that the third letter is not T, and then we can try others.

But we know T is in position 1, but it might be duplicated.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't duplicate, to test a new letter.

I think it's better to test a new letter.

Let me choose ""taper"" because P is a common letter.

So guess: ""taper""

But let's confirm the feedback we would get if the word is ""taper"":

- T: correct (position 1)
- A: correct (position 2)
- P: new letter, if it is in the word, but in ""taper"" we have P in position 3. If the secret word is ""taper"", then P would be correct. If not, then if P is in the word but wrong position, or absent.

But we are guessing to see.

We can also consider that in the first guess, we had no P, so if P were in the word, it would have been detected? No, because we didn't guess P in the first guess.

Similarly, second guess no P.

So we don't know about P.

Therefore, I'll go with ""taper"".

But let's see if there is a word that can test multiple letters at once? But we only have one position unknown, so we can't test multiple.

Unless we use a word that doesn't have the known letters in the correct positions? But that might be inefficient.

For example, we could guess a word that has the third letter and also tests other positions, but we already know four positions are fixed. So it's better to fix the known positions and only vary the unknown.

Therefore, I think ""taper"" is a good guess.

So the third guess is ""taper"".

But note: if the secret word is ""tater"", then by guessing ""taper"", we will get:

- T: ✓
- A: ✓
- P: x (if ""tater"" has T, not P)
- E: ✓
- R: ✓

But we would know that P is absent, and then we can try ""tater"" next.

Similarly, if it's ""tamer"", then P would be absent, and we try M next.

But we can also consider guessing ""tater"" directly to save a guess if it's correct.

But we don't know.

Since ""tater"" is a common word, and we have T, A, E, R, and duplicate T, it might be likely.

But let's see the feedback from the first guess: in ""crane"", we had E in position 5 marked as wrong. If the secret word is ""tater"", then E is in position 4, so in ""crane"", E in position 5 is wrong, which is consistent.

Similarly for ""taper"".

I think both are possible.

But to be safe, let's choose a word that doesn't duplicate letters first, so we test a new letter.

So I'll go with ""taper"".

### Analysis of Feedback and Reasoning for Next Guess

#### Step-by-Step Thought Process:
1. **Current Known Information from Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (""crane"")**:
     - C: Absent (x) → C is not in the secret word.
     - R: Present, wrong position (-) → R is in the word, but not in position 2.
     - A: Present, wrong position (-) → A is in the word, but not in position 3.
     - N: Absent (x) → N is not in the word.
     - E: Present, wrong position (-) → E is in the word, but not in position 5.
   - **Guess 2 (""tares"")**:
     - T: Correct position (✓) → T is in position 1.
     - A: Correct position (✓) → A is in position 2.
     - R: Present, wrong position (-) → R is in the word, but not in position 3.
     - E: Correct position (✓) → E is in position 4.
     - S: Absent (x) → S is not in the word.
   - **Inferences**:
     - The secret word starts with **T**, followed by **A** in position 2, and **E** in position 4 (i.e., the word pattern is `T A _ E _`).
     - **R must be in position 5**: 
       - R is confirmed present but cannot be in position 2 (from Guess 1) or position 3 (from Guess 2). Positions 1, 2, and 4 are occupied by T, A, and E, so R must be in position 5. Thus, the word pattern is now `T A _ E R`.
     - **Absent letters**: C, N, and S are eliminated.
     - **Position 3 constraints**:
       - Cannot be A (A is fixed in position 2, and Guess 1 ruled out position 3 for A).
       - Cannot be R (ruled out for position 3 by Guess 2).
       - Cannot be C, N, or S (absent letters).
       - Could be a duplicate of T or E (if the word has repeats), or a new letter not yet tested.

2. **Possible Words**:
   - The secret word must match `T A _ E R`. Common English words fitting this pattern include:
     - **TAPER** (e.g., to narrow or a candle): Uses P, a new letter.
     - **TAMER** (e.g., one who tames): Uses M, a new letter.
     - **TAKER** (e.g., one who takes): Uses K, a new letter.
     - **TATER** (e.g., informal for potato): Uses a duplicate T (position 3).
     - Less common options like **TABER** or **TAXER** are also possible but lower frequency.
   - **Key Insight**: The third letter is the only unknown. We need to test it efficiently.

3. **Strategy for Guess 3**:
   - **Goal**: Test the third position with a high-likelihood word that either solves the puzzle or provides new information.
   - **Why not guess a word with duplicates (like ""tater"") yet?** 
     - If ""tater"" is incorrect, we learn nothing new about other letters (e.g., P, M, K). Guessing a word with a new letter (e.g., P in ""taper"") tests for both the presence of that letter and its position.
   - **Why ""taper""?** 
     - It uses **P**, a common letter not yet tested (maximizes information gain).
     - If correct, we solve the puzzle. If incorrect, we learn whether P is present/absent, narrowing the list of possible words (e.g., if P is absent, ""tamer"" or ""taker"" become top candidates).
     - It fits the pattern `T A _ E R` with P in position 3, avoiding ruled-out positions/letters.
   - **Efficiency**: With 4 guesses remaining, this approach balances solving potential with information gain. If ""taper"" is wrong, feedback on P will quickly eliminate options.

4. **Final Decision**: 
   - Guess **""taper""** to test P in position 3. If feedback shows P is correct, the word is solved. If P is absent, we pivot to other candidates like ""tamer"" or ""tater"" next.

<guess>taper</guess>",taper,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but not in position 5)

Guess 2: ""tares""
- T: ✓ (correct, in position 1)
- A: ✓ (correct, in position 2)
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
- E: ✓ (correct, in position 4)
- S: x (not in the word)

So, from this, we know:

1. The first letter is T.
2. The second letter is A.
3. The fourth letter is E.
4. The letter R is in the word, but not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 3 (from second guess). Therefore, R must be in position 5 (since positions 1, 2, 3, and 4 are either taken or ruled out for R? But position 1 is T, position 2 is A, position 4 is E, and position 3 is not R. So the only position left is 5? But wait, the word has 5 letters, so position 5 is the only possibility? However, we must confirm: the secret word has R, and it cannot be in positions 2 or 3. Position 1 is T (so not R), position 2 is A (so not R), position 4 is E (so not R). Therefore, R must be in position 5.

But let's double-check: the feedback for ""tares"" has R marked as present but wrong position. In ""tares"", R is in position 3. Since we now know that position 3 is not R, and we also know from the first guess that position 2 is not R, and positions 1, 2, and 4 are fixed as T, A, E, then indeed R must be in position 5.

Additionally, we know that S is not in the word.

Also, from the first guess, we know that C and N are not in the word.

So, the secret word so far is: T A _ E _

And we know the fifth letter must be R? But wait, we have to confirm: the feedback for the second guess shows that R is present but not in position 3, and we have fixed positions 1,2,4. The only unknown position is 3 and 5. But position 5 is available. However, we must consider that the word might have more than one R? But the feedback doesn't indicate that. But it's possible. However, the feedback for ""crane"" had R in position 2 and it was marked as present (but wrong position). In ""tares"", R is in position 3 and marked as present (wrong position). So if R were in position 5, then in ""tares"", the R in position 3 would be an extra R? But the secret word might have only one R. However, we don't know for sure.

But let's think: if the secret word has R only in position 5, then in ""tares"", the R in position 3 would be an incorrect position (which it is, as per feedback) and the R in position 5 would be correct? But in ""tares"", we don't have a letter in position 5? ""tares"" is T-A-R-E-S, so position 5 is S. We don't have a letter in position 5 for R. So the feedback for R is only about the R in position 3. Therefore, the secret word has an R, but it's not in position 3. And we know it's not in position 2. And positions 1,2,4 are fixed as T,A,E. So the only position left is 5. Therefore, the fifth letter must be R.

But what about the third letter? We don't know it yet.

So the word is: T A ? E R

But wait, that would be five letters: position1: T, position2: A, position3: ?, position4: E, position5: R.

Now, we need to find the third letter.

We also know from the first guess that the word contains R, A, E (which we have) and we know C and N are not in the word. Also, S is not in the word (from second guess).

In the first guess, we had ""crane"" and we know that the secret word has R, A, E. Now we have T, A, E, R, and one missing letter in position 3.

What letters are possible for position 3?

We know the secret word does not contain: C, N, S (and also the letters that were not present in the feedback, but we don't have a full list).

From the two guesses, we have used: C, R, A, N, E, T, S.

We know C, N, S are absent.

The letter in position 3 must be a letter that is not C, N, S, and also not T, A, E, R? But T, A, E, R are already in the word, but they can be repeated? However, we don't have any indication of repeated letters so far.

But let's check: in the first guess, we had no repeated letters, and in the second guess, we had T, A, R, E, S (all distinct). The secret word: we have T, A, E, R and one more. If the secret word has no repeated letters, then the third letter must be a new letter that we haven't tried.

But we don't know if there are repeated letters. However, since we have no feedback indicating a repeated letter (for example, if a letter is repeated and one is correct and the other is not, it might show multiple marks), but in this case, we don't have that.

But to be safe, we should consider that the third letter could be a letter we haven't tried, or it could be one of the existing letters? But we have T, A, E, R already. If the third letter is one of these, then it would be a duplicate.

For example, if the third letter is T, then the word would be T A T E R. But that might be a valid word? ""tater"" (a potato). Similarly, if it's A, then ""taaer"" is not a word. If it's E, ""taeer"" not a word. If it's R, then ""tarer"" (one who tares) is a word? But let's see.

But we have to consider the feedback from the first guess. In ""crane"", we had A in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. But if the secret word has A in position 2 (which is fixed) and also in position 3? Then in ""crane"", the A in position 3 would be correct? But it was marked as wrong position. So that means the secret word does not have A in position 3, but it does have an A. Since we now know A is in position 2, then if there were a second A, it could be in position 3? But the feedback for ""crane"" would have marked the A as correct if it were in position 3? But it was marked as wrong position, meaning that the A is in the word but not in position 3. That doesn't preclude a second A? Actually, if there were two A's, and one is in position 2 (which we now know) and one in position 3, then in ""crane"", the A in position 3 would be correct and should be marked as correct (✓), but it was marked as wrong position (-). Therefore, the secret word does not have an A in position 3. So if the secret word has only one A, then we know that. Similarly, for other letters.

But in our case, for the third position, if we put A, it would be incorrect because we know A is in position 2 and the feedback from ""crane"" showed that position 3 is not A. Similarly, for T: in the first guess, we didn't have T. In the second guess, T is in position 1 and correct. If we put T in position 3, then the word would have two T's? But in the second guess, we only had one T and it was in position 1. The feedback didn't show any other T? The feedback for ""tares"" had T as correct in position 1, and the other letters: A correct, R wrong, E correct, S absent. There was no indication of another T? But if the secret word had a T in position 3, then in ""tares"", we only have one T (in position 1) and the secret word has two T's, so the feedback wouldn't show the second T because we didn't guess it. So it's possible.

Similarly for E: we have E in position 4. If we put E in position 3, then the word would be T A E E R. But in the first guess, we had E in position 5 and it was marked as wrong position. If the secret word has E in position 4 and also in position 3, then in ""crane"", the E in position 5 would be one of the E's? But the feedback marked it as wrong position, meaning that the E is in the word but not in position 5. It doesn't say anything about position 3. However, in the second guess, we have E in position 4 and it's correct. So if we put E in position 3, then the secret word has two E's. But we don't have feedback that rules that out.

Similarly for R: we think R is in position 5. If we put R in position 3, then the word would be T A R E R. But in the first guess, we had R in position 2 and it was marked as wrong position. If the secret word has R in position 3 and 5, then in ""crane"", the R in position 2 would be wrong, which is consistent. In ""tares"", we have R in position 3 and it was marked as wrong position? But if the secret word has R in position 3, then in ""tares"", the R in position 3 should be correct (✓), but it was marked as wrong position (-). Therefore, the secret word does not have R in position 3. So R cannot be in position 3.

Therefore, for position 3, we cannot have R (because of the feedback from ""tares"": R in position 3 is wrong). We cannot have A (because of feedback from ""crane"": A in position 3 is wrong). We cannot have T? We don't have direct feedback, but if we put T in position 3, it would be a duplicate. Similarly for E.

But duplicates are allowed? The word could have duplicate letters.

However, we have to consider the feedback.

Let me summarize the constraints for position 3:

- It cannot be C, N, S (absent letters).
- It cannot be A (because in ""crane"", A in position 3 was marked as wrong, and we now know A is in position 2, so if there were a second A, the feedback in ""crane"" would have shown it as correct? But wait, no: if there is a second A, and we guessed A in position 3, and the secret word has A in position 2 and 3, then the A in position 3 would be correct and should be marked as correct (✓). But in ""crane"", it was marked as wrong position (-). Therefore, the secret word does not have an A in position 3. So even if there is a second A, it cannot be in position 3. But we don't know if there is a second A. However, for position 3, we cannot put A because it would be incorrect (as per feedback).

Similarly, we cannot put R in position 3 because in ""tares"", R in position 3 was marked as wrong, meaning the secret word does not have R in position 3.

For T: we don't have any feedback that says T cannot be in position 3. Similarly for E.

But we also have to consider that the secret word might not have duplicate letters.

Given that, it might be more efficient to assume no duplicates for now and try a new letter.

But we have to consider all possibilities.

However, we have only 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We have 3 more after this? Actually, we have used 2, so we have 4 left? But we need to solve it.

The word is T A ? E R, and we need to find the missing letter.

Possible letters: any letter except C, N, S, and also excluding A and R for position 3 (as explained). But T and E are possible if duplicated.

But let's list possible words.

Common words that fit T A _ E R:

- TAPER (a candle or to narrow)
- TAMER (one who tames)
- TASER (a stun gun) but S is absent, so not possible.
- TAXER (one who taxes)
- TABER (a type of dance? not common)
- TAGER? not a word.
- TALER? a coin, but not common.
- TARER? but R is in position 5, and if we put R in position 3, we cannot because of feedback.

But we cannot have R in position 3.

Similarly, TATER (potato) - T A T E R, which has T in position 1 and 3.

Is that possible? Let's check against feedback.

First guess ""crane"": no T, so no issue.

Second guess ""tares"": we have T in position 1 (correct), A in 2 (correct), R in 3 (wrong), E in 4 (correct), S in 5 (absent). If the secret word is ""tater"", then:

- T in position 1: correct (matches)
- A in position 2: correct (matches)
- R in position 3: in ""tares"" we guessed R in 3, but in ""tater"" position 3 is T, not R. So R is not in position 3, which is consistent with the feedback (wrong position). But the secret word ""tater"" has R in position 5. In ""tares"", we did not guess any R in position 5? We guessed S in position 5. So the feedback for R: we have one R in the guess (position 3) and the secret word has one R (position 5). Since the positions are different, it should be marked as present but wrong position, which it was. Also, S is absent, which is correct.

So ""tater"" is a possible word.

Another possibility: ""taper"" - T A P E R.

Check against feedback:

First guess: no P, so no issue.

Second guess: ""tares"" vs ""taper"": 
- T: correct
- A: correct
- R: in ""tares"" we have R in 3, but in ""taper"" position 3 is P, not R. The R is in position 5. So the R in the guess (position 3) is not in the secret word at position 3, and the secret word has R in position 5. So the feedback should be R present but wrong position, which matches. S is absent, correct.

Similarly, ""tamer"": T A M E R.

Same logic: M is new, R in position 5.

Now, what about ""taxer"": T A X E R.

X is a letter.

But we need to see if it's valid.

Also, are there words with E in position 3? Like ""taeer"" is not a word. ""Taker"" would be T A K E R, but K is a letter.

""Taker"" is a word.

But let's list all possible common words:

- taper
- tamer
- taker
- taxer
- taber (less common)
- taler (less common)
- tater

But we need to figure out which one.

We have to make a guess that can distinguish these.

But we have only one letter missing, so we can try to guess one of these.

However, we have 4 more guesses, so we can try a word that includes several of the possible letters.

But note: we don't know the third letter, and we have multiple options.

We can use a guess that tests multiple possibilities.

But since we know the first, second, fourth, and fifth letters, and only the third is missing, we can try to guess one of the common ones.

But we have to be careful: if we guess wrong, we use a try.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has a new letter in position 3 and also includes other letters to test, but we already know four letters.

But we don't have to use the known letters? We can, but we can also use a word that has the known letters in the correct positions and a new letter in position 3.

But we don't have many letters left to test? We have used: C, R, A, N, E, T, S.

Absent: C, N, S.

Present: T, A, E, R, and one more.

The remaining letters are almost the entire alphabet minus a few.

But we can try a word that has T, A, E, R in the correct positions and a new letter in position 3.

But that's exactly what we are going to do: guess a word like ""taper"" or ""tamer"", etc.

But we need to choose one.

To maximize information, we might choose a word that has a common letter that appears in many possible words? But all are different.

Since we are not sure, we can choose a word that uses a letter we haven't tried, so that if it's wrong, we get information about that letter.

For example, if we guess ""taper"", and it's wrong, then we know P is not in the word, and then we can try another.

Similarly for ""tamer"", we test M.

But we have to start somewhere.

Let's see the frequency of letters. Common letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... but we have used E, T, A, R. N and S are out. So O, I, L, U, D, etc.

In the possible words:

- taper: P
- tamer: M
- taker: K
- taxer: X
- taber: B
- taler: L
- tater: T (duplicate)

T is already in the word, so ""tater"" has a duplicate T.

We can try ""tater"" first because it uses a letter we already know is present (T), so if it's wrong, we know that the third letter is not T, and then we can try others.

But we know T is in position 1, but it might be duplicated.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't duplicate, to test a new letter.

I think it's better to test a new letter.

Let me choose ""taper"" because P is a common letter.

So guess: ""taper""

But let's confirm the feedback we would get if the word is ""taper"":

- T: correct (position 1)
- A: correct (position 2)
- P: new letter, if it is in the word, but in ""taper"" we have P in position 3. If the secret word is ""taper"", then P would be correct. If not, then if P is in the word but wrong position, or absent.

But we are guessing to see.

We can also consider that in the first guess, we had no P, so if P were in the word, it would have been detected? No, because we didn't guess P in the first guess.

Similarly, second guess no P.

So we don't know about P.

Therefore, I'll go with ""taper"".

But let's see if there is a word that can test multiple letters at once? But we only have one position unknown, so we can't test multiple.

Unless we use a word that doesn't have the known letters in the correct positions? But that might be inefficient.

For example, we could guess a word that has the third letter and also tests other positions, but we already know four positions are fixed. So it's better to fix the known positions and only vary the unknown.

Therefore, I think ""taper"" is a good guess.

So the third guess is ""taper"".

But note: if the secret word is ""tater"", then by guessing ""taper"", we will get:

- T: ✓
- A: ✓
- P: x (if ""tater"" has T, not P)
- E: ✓
- R: ✓

But we would know that P is absent, and then we can try ""tater"" next.

Similarly, if it's ""tamer"", then P would be absent, and we try M next.

But we can also consider guessing ""tater"" directly to save a guess if it's correct.

But we don't know.

Since ""tater"" is a common word, and we have T, A, E, R, and duplicate T, it might be likely.

But let's see the feedback from the first guess: in ""crane"", we had E in position 5 marked as wrong. If the secret word is ""tater"", then E is in position 4, so in ""crane"", E in position 5 is wrong, which is consistent.

Similarly for ""taper"".

I think both are possible.

But to be safe, let's choose a word that doesn't duplicate letters first, so we test a new letter.

So I'll go with ""taper"".

<guess>taper</guess>### Analysis of Feedback and Reasoning for Next Guess

#### Step-by-Step Thought Process:
1. **Current Known Information from Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (""crane"")**:
     - C: Absent (x) → C is not in the secret word.
     - R: Present, wrong position (-) → R is in the word, but not in position 2.
     - A: Present, wrong position (-) → A is in the word, but not in position 3.
     - N: Absent (x) → N is not in the word.
     - E: Present, wrong position (-) → E is in the word, but not in position 5.
   - **Guess 2 (""tares"")**:
     - T: Correct position (✓) → T is in position 1.
     - A: Correct position (✓) → A is in position 2.
     - R: Present, wrong position (-) → R is in the word, but not in position 3.
     - E: Correct position (✓) → E is in position 4.
     - S: Absent (x) → S is not in the word.
   - **Inferences**:
     - The secret word starts with **T**, followed by **A** in position 2, and **E** in position 4 (i.e., the word pattern is `T A _ E _`).
     - **R must be in position 5**: 
       - R is confirmed present but cannot be in position 2 (from Guess 1) or position 3 (from Guess 2). Positions 1, 2, and 4 are occupied by T, A, and E, so R must be in position 5. Thus, the word pattern is now `T A _ E R`.
     - **Absent letters**: C, N, and S are eliminated.
     - **Position 3 constraints**:
       - Cannot be A (A is fixed in position 2, and Guess 1 ruled out position 3 for A).
       - Cannot be R (ruled out for position 3 by Guess 2).
       - Cannot be C, N, or S (absent letters).
       - Could be a duplicate of T or E (if the word has repeats), or a new letter not yet tested.

2. **Possible Words**:
   - The secret word must match `T A _ E R`. Common English words fitting this pattern include:
     - **TAPER** (e.g., to narrow or a candle): Uses P, a new letter.
     - **TAMER** (e.g., one who tames): Uses M, a new letter.
     - **TAKER** (e.g., one who takes): Uses K, a new letter.
     - **TATER** (e.g., informal for potato): Uses a duplicate T (position 3).
     - Less common options like **TABER** or **TAXER** are also possible but lower frequency.
   - **Key Insight**: The third letter is the only unknown. We need to test it efficiently.

3. **Strategy for Guess 3**:
   - **Goal**: Test the third position with a high-likelihood word that either solves the puzzle or provides new information.
   - **Why not guess a word with duplicates (like ""tater"") yet?** 
     - If ""tater"" is incorrect, we learn nothing new about other letters (e.g., P, M, K). Guessing a word with a new letter (e.g., P in ""taper"") tests for both the presence of that letter and its position.
   - **Why ""taper""?** 
     - It uses **P**, a common letter not yet tested (maximizes information gain).
     - If correct, we solve the puzzle. If incorrect, we learn whether P is present/absent, narrowing the list of possible words (e.g., if P is absent, ""tamer"" or ""taker"" become top candidates).
     - It fits the pattern `T A _ E R` with P in position 3, avoiding ruled-out positions/letters.
   - **Efficiency**: With 4 guesses remaining, this approach balances solving potential with information gain. If ""taper"" is wrong, feedback on P will quickly eliminate options.

4. **Final Decision**: 
   - Guess **""taper""** to test P in position 3. If feedback shows P is correct, the word is solved. If P is absent, we pivot to other candidates like ""tamer"" or ""tater"" next.",Guess 3: taper -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) A(✓) P(x) E(✓) R(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,TAMER,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all are distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the secret word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the secret word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R, A, and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
 - The secret word does not contain C or N.

 Since R, A, and E are in the word, we should try to use them again in different positions.

 Also, note that in ""crane"", the positions were:
  1: C (x)
  2: R (but should be elsewhere) -> so R cannot be in position 2
  3: A (but should be elsewhere) -> so A cannot be in position 3
  4: N (x)
  5: E (but should be elsewhere) -> so E cannot be in position 5

 We have 6 tries, so we can use a second guess to test new positions for R, A, E and also try to include other common letters.

 We must avoid using C and N.

 Let's think of a word that includes R, A, E and two new letters (preferably common ones) and places R, A, E in positions different from the first guess.

 Constraints for the next guess:
  - Avoid position 2 for R, position 3 for A, position 5 for E.
  - The word must not contain C or N.

 We can try to put R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: we know R is in the word but not in position 2. Similarly, A not in 3, E not in 5.

 However, we don't know the exact positions yet.

 Let's try to form a word that has:
  - R in a new position (say position 1 or 4 or 5? but note we have to avoid position 2)
  - A in a new position (not 3, so 1,2,4,5)
  - E in a new position (not 5, so 1,2,3,4)

 Also, we want to test new letters. Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, etc.

 We can try a word that starts with R? But note: we don't know if R is at the beginning.

 Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has R, A, E and two new letters.

 Example words: 
  ""RAISE"" - but note: 
    R at position 1 (which is new for R, since previously it was at 2) -> allowed
    A at position 2 (previously at 3, so 2 is new) -> allowed
    I is new
    S is new
    E at position 5 -> but feedback said E is not in position 5? Actually, the feedback for E was that it is in the word but not in position 5. So we cannot put E at position 5 again? Actually, we can, but we know it's not correct because the feedback said it's not in position 5. So we should avoid putting E at position 5.

 Therefore, ""RAISE"" has E at position 5, which we know is wrong. So we avoid that.

 Another word: ""ROATE"" (a valid word? yes, meaning to grow or increase) but:
  R at 1 -> new
  O at 2 -> new
  A at 3 -> but we know A is not at position 3? Actually, the feedback for A was that it is in the word but not at position 3. So we cannot put A at 3 again? We can, but we know it's not the correct position. However, we are trying to test new positions. Also, E is at 5 again, which we know is wrong.

 So avoid ""ROATE"" for the same reason.

 Let's try ""STARE"":
  S at 1 -> new
  T at 2 -> new
  A at 3 -> but we know A is not at 3? So we shouldn't put A at 3? Actually, we can put it to test, but we already know it's not the correct position. However, we are trying to get new information. But we have to avoid known wrong positions? Actually, we can put a letter in a known wrong position again? But that would be inefficient because we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting A at position 3.

 Therefore, we need a word that has:
  R not at 2
  A not at 3
  E not at 5

 And we want to test new letters.

 Let me try ""LATER"":
  L at 1 -> new
  A at 2 -> new position for A (previously at 3, now at 2) -> allowed
  T at 3 -> new
  E at 4 -> new position for E (previously at 5, now at 4) -> allowed
  R at 5 -> new position for R (previously at 2, now at 5) -> allowed

 This word uses L and T as new letters, and places A, E, R in positions that are not the ones we know are wrong.

 Also, we avoid C and N.

 So ""LATER"" is a good candidate.

 But note: we have to make sure it's a valid word.

 Alternatively, ""RATEL"" (a honey badger) but that might be less common.

 Another common word: ""ALTER"" - similar to ""LATER"", but with A at 1 and L at 2? But then A is at 1, which is new.

 However, let's stick with ""LATER"".

 But wait: we have to consider that the secret word has R, A, E. In ""LATER"", we have:
  L (new), A (known, at position 2), T (new), E (known, at position 4), R (known, at position 5).

 This covers two new letters and repositions the known letters.

 Alternatively, we can try ""TARES"" (a valid word, meaning weed or a unit of weight) but that has 5 letters? T-A-R-E-S.

  T at 1 -> new
  A at 2 -> new for A (previously at 3, now at 2) -> allowed
  R at 3 -> but we know R is not at position 2? But position 3 is new for R. However, we don't have a constraint on R at 3? Only that it's not at 2. So R at 3 is allowed.
  E at 4 -> new for E (previously at 5, now at 4) -> allowed
  S at 5 -> new

 This also seems good.

 But note: we have two known letters (A and R) in positions we haven't tested? Actually, we are testing new positions.

 However, we have to choose one.

 Let me compare:
  ""LATER"": tests L and T, and positions 2 for A, 4 for E, 5 for R.
  ""TARES"": tests T, S, and positions 2 for A, 3 for R, 4 for E.

 We might get more information from ""TARES"" because it has S at the end, which is a common letter.

 But note: we are limited by the fact that we know the word has R, A, E and two other letters (which are not C or N).

 I think both are valid. Let's choose ""TARES"" because it has more common letters? Or because it tests R in a new position (3) and we haven't tested that.

 Alternatively, we can choose ""STARE"" but then A is at 3 which we know is wrong? So we avoid that.

 Actually, we can adjust ""STARE"" to avoid A at 3? But we can't because the word is fixed.

 So let's go with ""TARES"".

 But note: the feedback for the first guess had R at position 2 as wrong, but that doesn't mean R cannot be at other positions? We are free to test.

 However, we are trying to maximize information.

 Another candidate: ""ARISE"" - but E is at 5 again? So avoid.

 How about ""RAISE"" but E at 5? Avoid.

 How about ""SERAI"" (an inn) but that might be too obscure.

 Let me stick with ""TARES"".

 But wait, what about ""REACT""? But we know C is not in the word, so we cannot use C.

 So ""TARES"" is valid.

 Alternatively, ""PARSE"": 
  P at 1 -> new
  A at 2 -> new for A (allowed)
  R at 3 -> new for R (allowed)
  S at 4 -> new
  E at 5 -> but we know E is not at 5? So avoid.

 Therefore, ""TARES"" seems good.

 But note: we have to make sure that the word is in the word list. Since the game uses valid English words, and ""tares"" is a valid word, we can use it.

 So second guess: ""TARES""

<guess>tares</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C** and **N** are absent from the secret word (marked `x`).
- **R**, **A**, and **E** are present but in incorrect positions (marked `-`). Specifically:
  - R cannot be in position 2.
  - A cannot be in position 3.
  - E cannot be in position 5.

For the next guess, I prioritized:
1. **Including known letters (R, A, E)** in new positions to test their correct placement.
2. **Avoiding C and N**.
3. **Introducing new common letters** (T, S) to maximize information.
4. **Avoiding positions ruled out** by the first guess.

The word **""tares""** fits these criteria:
- Places A in position 2 (new, not position 3).
- Places R in position 3 (new, not position 2).
- Places E in position 4 (new, not position 5).
- Introduces T (position 1) and S (position 5), both untested letters.
- Is a valid 5-letter English word.

This guess efficiently tests new positions for known letters and explores new letters to narrow down possibilities.

<guess>tares</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: tares -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) A(✓) R(-) E(✓) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but not in position 5)

Guess 2: ""tares""
- T: ✓ (correct, in position 1)
- A: ✓ (correct, in position 2)
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
- E: ✓ (correct, in position 4)
- S: x (not in the word)

So, from this, we know:

1. The first letter is T.
2. The second letter is A.
3. The fourth letter is E.
4. The letter R is in the word, but not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 3 (from second guess). Therefore, R must be in position 5 (since positions 1, 2, 3, and 4 are either taken or ruled out for R? But position 1 is T, position 2 is A, position 4 is E, and position 3 is not R. So the only position left is 5? But wait, the word has 5 letters, so position 5 is the only possibility? However, we must confirm: the secret word has R, and it cannot be in positions 2 or 3. Position 1 is T (so not R), position 2 is A (so not R), position 4 is E (so not R). Therefore, R must be in position 5.

But let's double-check: the feedback for ""tares"" has R marked as present but wrong position. In ""tares"", R is in position 3. Since we now know that position 3 is not R, and we also know from the first guess that position 2 is not R, and positions 1, 2, and 4 are fixed as T, A, E, then indeed R must be in position 5.

Additionally, we know that S is not in the word.

Also, from the first guess, we know that C and N are not in the word.

So, the secret word so far is: T A _ E _

And we know the fifth letter must be R? But wait, we have to confirm: the feedback for the second guess shows that R is present but not in position 3, and we have fixed positions 1,2,4. The only unknown position is 3 and 5. But position 5 is available. However, we must consider that the word might have more than one R? But the feedback doesn't indicate that. But it's possible. However, the feedback for ""crane"" had R in position 2 and it was marked as present (but wrong position). In ""tares"", R is in position 3 and marked as present (wrong position). So if R were in position 5, then in ""tares"", the R in position 3 would be an extra R? But the secret word might have only one R. However, we don't know for sure.

But let's think: if the secret word has R only in position 5, then in ""tares"", the R in position 3 would be an incorrect position (which it is, as per feedback) and the R in position 5 would be correct? But in ""tares"", we don't have a letter in position 5? ""tares"" is T-A-R-E-S, so position 5 is S. We don't have a letter in position 5 for R. So the feedback for R is only about the R in position 3. Therefore, the secret word has an R, but it's not in position 3. And we know it's not in position 2. And positions 1,2,4 are fixed as T,A,E. So the only position left is 5. Therefore, the fifth letter must be R.

But what about the third letter? We don't know it yet.

So the word is: T A ? E R

But wait, that would be five letters: position1: T, position2: A, position3: ?, position4: E, position5: R.

Now, we need to find the third letter.

We also know from the first guess that the word contains R, A, E (which we have) and we know C and N are not in the word. Also, S is not in the word (from second guess).

In the first guess, we had ""crane"" and we know that the secret word has R, A, E. Now we have T, A, E, R, and one missing letter in position 3.

What letters are possible for position 3?

We know the secret word does not contain: C, N, S (and also the letters that were not present in the feedback, but we don't have a full list).

From the two guesses, we have used: C, R, A, N, E, T, S.

We know C, N, S are absent.

The letter in position 3 must be a letter that is not C, N, S, and also not T, A, E, R? But T, A, E, R are already in the word, but they can be repeated? However, we don't have any indication of repeated letters so far.

But let's check: in the first guess, we had no repeated letters, and in the second guess, we had T, A, R, E, S (all distinct). The secret word: we have T, A, E, R and one more. If the secret word has no repeated letters, then the third letter must be a new letter that we haven't tried.

But we don't know if there are repeated letters. However, since we have no feedback indicating a repeated letter (for example, if a letter is repeated and one is correct and the other is not, it might show multiple marks), but in this case, we don't have that.

But to be safe, we should consider that the third letter could be a letter we haven't tried, or it could be one of the existing letters? But we have T, A, E, R already. If the third letter is one of these, then it would be a duplicate.

For example, if the third letter is T, then the word would be T A T E R. But that might be a valid word? ""tater"" (a potato). Similarly, if it's A, then ""taaer"" is not a word. If it's E, ""taeer"" not a word. If it's R, then ""tarer"" (one who tares) is a word? But let's see.

But we have to consider the feedback from the first guess. In ""crane"", we had A in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. But if the secret word has A in position 2 (which is fixed) and also in position 3? Then in ""crane"", the A in position 3 would be correct? But it was marked as wrong position. So that means the secret word does not have A in position 3, but it does have an A. Since we now know A is in position 2, then if there were a second A, it could be in position 3? But the feedback for ""crane"" would have marked the A as correct if it were in position 3? But it was marked as wrong position, meaning that the A is in the word but not in position 3. That doesn't preclude a second A? Actually, if there were two A's, and one is in position 2 (which we now know) and one in position 3, then in ""crane"", the A in position 3 would be correct and should be marked as correct (✓), but it was marked as wrong position (-). Therefore, the secret word does not have an A in position 3. So if the secret word has only one A, then we know that. Similarly, for other letters.

But in our case, for the third position, if we put A, it would be incorrect because we know A is in position 2 and the feedback from ""crane"" showed that position 3 is not A. Similarly, for T: in the first guess, we didn't have T. In the second guess, T is in position 1 and correct. If we put T in position 3, then the word would have two T's? But in the second guess, we only had one T and it was in position 1. The feedback didn't show any other T? The feedback for ""tares"" had T as correct in position 1, and the other letters: A correct, R wrong, E correct, S absent. There was no indication of another T? But if the secret word had a T in position 3, then in ""tares"", we only have one T (in position 1) and the secret word has two T's, so the feedback wouldn't show the second T because we didn't guess it. So it's possible.

Similarly for E: we have E in position 4. If we put E in position 3, then the word would be T A E E R. But in the first guess, we had E in position 5 and it was marked as wrong position. If the secret word has E in position 4 and also in position 3, then in ""crane"", the E in position 5 would be one of the E's? But the feedback marked it as wrong position, meaning that the E is in the word but not in position 5. It doesn't say anything about position 3. However, in the second guess, we have E in position 4 and it's correct. So if we put E in position 3, then the secret word has two E's. But we don't have feedback that rules that out.

Similarly for R: we think R is in position 5. If we put R in position 3, then the word would be T A R E R. But in the first guess, we had R in position 2 and it was marked as wrong position. If the secret word has R in position 3 and 5, then in ""crane"", the R in position 2 would be wrong, which is consistent. In ""tares"", we have R in position 3 and it was marked as wrong position? But if the secret word has R in position 3, then in ""tares"", the R in position 3 should be correct (✓), but it was marked as wrong position (-). Therefore, the secret word does not have R in position 3. So R cannot be in position 3.

Therefore, for position 3, we cannot have R (because of the feedback from ""tares"": R in position 3 is wrong). We cannot have A (because of feedback from ""crane"": A in position 3 is wrong). We cannot have T? We don't have direct feedback, but if we put T in position 3, it would be a duplicate. Similarly for E.

But duplicates are allowed? The word could have duplicate letters.

However, we have to consider the feedback.

Let me summarize the constraints for position 3:

- It cannot be C, N, S (absent letters).
- It cannot be A (because in ""crane"", A in position 3 was marked as wrong, and we now know A is in position 2, so if there were a second A, the feedback in ""crane"" would have shown it as correct? But wait, no: if there is a second A, and we guessed A in position 3, and the secret word has A in position 2 and 3, then the A in position 3 would be correct and should be marked as correct (✓). But in ""crane"", it was marked as wrong position (-). Therefore, the secret word does not have an A in position 3. So even if there is a second A, it cannot be in position 3. But we don't know if there is a second A. However, for position 3, we cannot put A because it would be incorrect (as per feedback).

Similarly, we cannot put R in position 3 because in ""tares"", R in position 3 was marked as wrong, meaning the secret word does not have R in position 3.

For T: we don't have any feedback that says T cannot be in position 3. Similarly for E.

But we also have to consider that the secret word might not have duplicate letters.

Given that, it might be more efficient to assume no duplicates for now and try a new letter.

But we have to consider all possibilities.

However, we have only 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We have 3 more after this? Actually, we have used 2, so we have 4 left? But we need to solve it.

The word is T A ? E R, and we need to find the missing letter.

Possible letters: any letter except C, N, S, and also excluding A and R for position 3 (as explained). But T and E are possible if duplicated.

But let's list possible words.

Common words that fit T A _ E R:

- TAPER (a candle or to narrow)
- TAMER (one who tames)
- TASER (a stun gun) but S is absent, so not possible.
- TAXER (one who taxes)
- TABER (a type of dance? not common)
- TAGER? not a word.
- TALER? a coin, but not common.
- TARER? but R is in position 5, and if we put R in position 3, we cannot because of feedback.

But we cannot have R in position 3.

Similarly, TATER (potato) - T A T E R, which has T in position 1 and 3.

Is that possible? Let's check against feedback.

First guess ""crane"": no T, so no issue.

Second guess ""tares"": we have T in position 1 (correct), A in 2 (correct), R in 3 (wrong), E in 4 (correct), S in 5 (absent). If the secret word is ""tater"", then:

- T in position 1: correct (matches)
- A in position 2: correct (matches)
- R in position 3: in ""tares"" we guessed R in 3, but in ""tater"" position 3 is T, not R. So R is not in position 3, which is consistent with the feedback (wrong position). But the secret word ""tater"" has R in position 5. In ""tares"", we did not guess any R in position 5? We guessed S in position 5. So the feedback for R: we have one R in the guess (position 3) and the secret word has one R (position 5). Since the positions are different, it should be marked as present but wrong position, which it was. Also, S is absent, which is correct.

So ""tater"" is a possible word.

Another possibility: ""taper"" - T A P E R.

Check against feedback:

First guess: no P, so no issue.

Second guess: ""tares"" vs ""taper"": 
- T: correct
- A: correct
- R: in ""tares"" we have R in 3, but in ""taper"" position 3 is P, not R. The R is in position 5. So the R in the guess (position 3) is not in the secret word at position 3, and the secret word has R in position 5. So the feedback should be R present but wrong position, which matches. S is absent, correct.

Similarly, ""tamer"": T A M E R.

Same logic: M is new, R in position 5.

Now, what about ""taxer"": T A X E R.

X is a letter.

But we need to see if it's valid.

Also, are there words with E in position 3? Like ""taeer"" is not a word. ""Taker"" would be T A K E R, but K is a letter.

""Taker"" is a word.

But let's list all possible common words:

- taper
- tamer
- taker
- taxer
- taber (less common)
- taler (less common)
- tater

But we need to figure out which one.

We have to make a guess that can distinguish these.

But we have only one letter missing, so we can try to guess one of these.

However, we have 4 more guesses, so we can try a word that includes several of the possible letters.

But note: we don't know the third letter, and we have multiple options.

We can use a guess that tests multiple possibilities.

But since we know the first, second, fourth, and fifth letters, and only the third is missing, we can try to guess one of the common ones.

But we have to be careful: if we guess wrong, we use a try.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has a new letter in position 3 and also includes other letters to test, but we already know four letters.

But we don't have to use the known letters? We can, but we can also use a word that has the known letters in the correct positions and a new letter in position 3.

But we don't have many letters left to test? We have used: C, R, A, N, E, T, S.

Absent: C, N, S.

Present: T, A, E, R, and one more.

The remaining letters are almost the entire alphabet minus a few.

But we can try a word that has T, A, E, R in the correct positions and a new letter in position 3.

But that's exactly what we are going to do: guess a word like ""taper"" or ""tamer"", etc.

But we need to choose one.

To maximize information, we might choose a word that has a common letter that appears in many possible words? But all are different.

Since we are not sure, we can choose a word that uses a letter we haven't tried, so that if it's wrong, we get information about that letter.

For example, if we guess ""taper"", and it's wrong, then we know P is not in the word, and then we can try another.

Similarly for ""tamer"", we test M.

But we have to start somewhere.

Let's see the frequency of letters. Common letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... but we have used E, T, A, R. N and S are out. So O, I, L, U, D, etc.

In the possible words:

- taper: P
- tamer: M
- taker: K
- taxer: X
- taber: B
- taler: L
- tater: T (duplicate)

T is already in the word, so ""tater"" has a duplicate T.

We can try ""tater"" first because it uses a letter we already know is present (T), so if it's wrong, we know that the third letter is not T, and then we can try others.

But we know T is in position 1, but it might be duplicated.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't duplicate, to test a new letter.

I think it's better to test a new letter.

Let me choose ""taper"" because P is a common letter.

So guess: ""taper""

But let's confirm the feedback we would get if the word is ""taper"":

- T: correct (position 1)
- A: correct (position 2)
- P: new letter, if it is in the word, but in ""taper"" we have P in position 3. If the secret word is ""taper"", then P would be correct. If not, then if P is in the word but wrong position, or absent.

But we are guessing to see.

We can also consider that in the first guess, we had no P, so if P were in the word, it would have been detected? No, because we didn't guess P in the first guess.

Similarly, second guess no P.

So we don't know about P.

Therefore, I'll go with ""taper"".

But let's see if there is a word that can test multiple letters at once? But we only have one position unknown, so we can't test multiple.

Unless we use a word that doesn't have the known letters in the correct positions? But that might be inefficient.

For example, we could guess a word that has the third letter and also tests other positions, but we already know four positions are fixed. So it's better to fix the known positions and only vary the unknown.

Therefore, I think ""taper"" is a good guess.

So the third guess is ""taper"".

But note: if the secret word is ""tater"", then by guessing ""taper"", we will get:

- T: ✓
- A: ✓
- P: x (if ""tater"" has T, not P)
- E: ✓
- R: ✓

But we would know that P is absent, and then we can try ""tater"" next.

Similarly, if it's ""tamer"", then P would be absent, and we try M next.

But we can also consider guessing ""tater"" directly to save a guess if it's correct.

But we don't know.

Since ""tater"" is a common word, and we have T, A, E, R, and duplicate T, it might be likely.

But let's see the feedback from the first guess: in ""crane"", we had E in position 5 marked as wrong. If the secret word is ""tater"", then E is in position 4, so in ""crane"", E in position 5 is wrong, which is consistent.

Similarly for ""taper"".

I think both are possible.

But to be safe, let's choose a word that doesn't duplicate letters first, so we test a new letter.

So I'll go with ""taper"".

<guess>taper</guess>### Analysis of Feedback and Reasoning for Next Guess

#### Step-by-Step Thought Process:
1. **Current Known Information from Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (""crane"")**:
     - C: Absent (x) → C is not in the secret word.
     - R: Present, wrong position (-) → R is in the word, but not in position 2.
     - A: Present, wrong position (-) → A is in the word, but not in position 3.
     - N: Absent (x) → N is not in the word.
     - E: Present, wrong position (-) → E is in the word, but not in position 5.
   - **Guess 2 (""tares"")**:
     - T: Correct position (✓) → T is in position 1.
     - A: Correct position (✓) → A is in position 2.
     - R: Present, wrong position (-) → R is in the word, but not in position 3.
     - E: Correct position (✓) → E is in position 4.
     - S: Absent (x) → S is not in the word.
   - **Inferences**:
     - The secret word starts with **T**, followed by **A** in position 2, and **E** in position 4 (i.e., the word pattern is `T A _ E _`).
     - **R must be in position 5**: 
       - R is confirmed present but cannot be in position 2 (from Guess 1) or position 3 (from Guess 2). Positions 1, 2, and 4 are occupied by T, A, and E, so R must be in position 5. Thus, the word pattern is now `T A _ E R`.
     - **Absent letters**: C, N, and S are eliminated.
     - **Position 3 constraints**:
       - Cannot be A (A is fixed in position 2, and Guess 1 ruled out position 3 for A).
       - Cannot be R (ruled out for position 3 by Guess 2).
       - Cannot be C, N, or S (absent letters).
       - Could be a duplicate of T or E (if the word has repeats), or a new letter not yet tested.

2. **Possible Words**:
   - The secret word must match `T A _ E R`. Common English words fitting this pattern include:
     - **TAPER** (e.g., to narrow or a candle): Uses P, a new letter.
     - **TAMER** (e.g., one who tames): Uses M, a new letter.
     - **TAKER** (e.g., one who takes): Uses K, a new letter.
     - **TATER** (e.g., informal for potato): Uses a duplicate T (position 3).
     - Less common options like **TABER** or **TAXER** are also possible but lower frequency.
   - **Key Insight**: The third letter is the only unknown. We need to test it efficiently.

3. **Strategy for Guess 3**:
   - **Goal**: Test the third position with a high-likelihood word that either solves the puzzle or provides new information.
   - **Why not guess a word with duplicates (like ""tater"") yet?** 
     - If ""tater"" is incorrect, we learn nothing new about other letters (e.g., P, M, K). Guessing a word with a new letter (e.g., P in ""taper"") tests for both the presence of that letter and its position.
   - **Why ""taper""?** 
     - It uses **P**, a common letter not yet tested (maximizes information gain).
     - If correct, we solve the puzzle. If incorrect, we learn whether P is present/absent, narrowing the list of possible words (e.g., if P is absent, ""tamer"" or ""taker"" become top candidates).
     - It fits the pattern `T A _ E R` with P in position 3, avoiding ruled-out positions/letters.
   - **Efficiency**: With 4 guesses remaining, this approach balances solving potential with information gain. If ""taper"" is wrong, feedback on P will quickly eliminate options.

4. **Final Decision**: 
   - Guess **""taper""** to test P in position 3. If feedback shows P is correct, the word is solved. If P is absent, we pivot to other candidates like ""tamer"" or ""tater"" next.

Actually, the feedback for E was that it is in the word but not in position 5. So we cannot put E at position 5 again? Actually, we can, but we know it\'s not correct because the feedback said it\'s not in position 5. So we should avoid putting E at position 5.\n\n Therefore, ""RAISE"" has E at position 5, which we know is wrong. So we avoid that.\n\n Another word: ""ROATE"" (a valid word? yes, meaning to grow or increase) but:\n  R at 1 -> new\n  O at 2 -> new\n  A at 3 -> but we know A is not at position 3? Actually, the feedback for A was that it is in the word but not at position 3. So we cannot put A at 3 again? We can, but we know it\'s not the correct position. However, we are trying to test new positions.

So we shouldn\'t put A at 3? Actually, we can put it to test, but we already know it\'s not the correct position. However, we are trying to get new information. But we have to avoid known wrong positions? Actually, we can put a letter in a known wrong position again? But that would be inefficient because we know it\'s not there. So we should avoid putting A at position 3.\n\n Therefore, we need a word that has:\n  R not at 2\n  A not at 3\n  E not at 5\n\n And we want to test new letters.\n\n Let me try ""LATER"":\n  L at 1 -> new\n  A at 2 -> new position for A (previously at 3, now at 2) -> allowed\n  T at 3 -> new\n  E at 4 -> new position for E (previously at 5, now at 4) -> allowed\n  R at 5 -> new position for R (previously at 2, now at 5) -> allowed\n\n This word uses L and T as new letters, and places A, E, R in positions that are not the ones we know are wrong.\n\n Also, we avoid C and N.\n\n So ""LATER"" is a good candidate.\n\n But note: we have to make sure it\'s a valid word.\n\n Alternatively, ""RATEL"" (a honey badger) but that might be less common.\n\n Another common word: ""ALTER"" - similar to ""LATER"", but with A at 1 and L at 2? But then A is at 1, which is new.\n\n However, let\'s stick with ""LATER"".\n\n But wait: we have to consider that the secret word has R, A, E. In ""LATER"", we have:\n  L (new), A (known, at position 2), T (new), E (known, at position 4), R (known, at position 5).\n\n This covers two new letters and repositions the known letters.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""TARES"" (a valid word, meaning weed or a unit of weight) but that has 5 letters? T-A-R-E-S.\n\n  T at 1 -> new\n  A at 2 -> new for A (previously at 3, now at 2) -> allowed\n  R at 3 -> but we know R is not at position 2? But position 3 is new for R. However, we don\'t have a constraint on R at 3? Only that it\'s not at 2. So R at 3 is allowed.\n  E at 4 -> new for E (previously at 5, now at 4) -> allowed\n  S at 5 -> new\n\n This also seems good.\n\n But note: we have two known letters (A and R) in positions we haven\'t tested? Actually, we are testing new positions.\n\n However, we have to choose one.\n\n Let me compare:\n  ""LATER"": tests L and T, and positions 2 for A, 4 for E, 5 for R.\n  ""TARES"": tests T, S, and positions 2 for A, 3 for R, 4 for E.\n\n We might get more information from ""TARES"" because it has S at the end, which is a common letter.\n\n But note: we are limited by the fact that we know the word has R, A, E and two other letters (which are not C or N).\n\n I think both are valid. Let\'s choose ""TARES"" because it has more common letters? Or because it tests R in a new position (3) and we haven\'t tested that.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose ""STARE"" but then A is at 3 which we know is wrong? So we avoid that.\n\n Actually, we can adjust ""STARE"" to avoid A at 3? But we can\'t because the word is fixed.\n\n So let\'s go with ""TARES"".\n\n But note: the feedback for the first guess had R at position 2 as wrong, but that doesn\'t mean R cannot be at other positions? We are free to test.\n\n However, we are trying to maximize information.\n\n Another candidate: ""ARISE"" - but E is at 5 again? So avoid.\n\n How about ""RAISE"" but E at 5? Avoid.\n\n How about ""SERAI"" (an inn) but that might be too obscure.\n\n Let me stick with ""TARES"".\n\n But wait, what about ""REACT""? But we know C is not in the word, so we cannot use C.\n\n So ""TARES"" is valid.\n\n Alternatively, ""PARSE"": \n  P at 1 -> new\n  A at 2 -> new for A (allowed)\n  R at 3 -> new for R (allowed)\n  S at 4 -> new\n  E at 5 -> but we know E is not at 5? So avoid.\n\n Therefore, ""TARES"" seems good.\n\n But note: we have to make sure that the word is in the word list. Since the game uses valid English words, and ""tares"" is a valid word, we can use it.\n\n So second guess: ""TARES""\n\n<guess>tares</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C** and **N** are absent from the secret word (marked `x`).\n- **R**, **A**, and **E** are present but in incorrect positions (marked `-`). Specifically:\n  - R cannot be in position 2.\n  - A cannot be in position 3.\n  - E cannot be in position 5.\n\nFor the next guess, I prioritized:\n1. **Including known letters (R, A, E)** in new positions to test their correct placement.\n2. **Avoiding C and N**.\n3. **Introducing new common letters** (T, S) to maximize information.\n4. **Avoiding positions ruled out** by the first guess.\n\nThe word **""tares""** fits these criteria:\n- Places A in position 2 (new, not position 3).\n- Places R in position 3 (new, not position 2).\n- Places E in position 4 (new, not position 5).\n- Introduces T (position 1) and S (position 5), both untested letters.\n- Is a valid 5-letter English word.\n\nThis guess efficiently tests new positions for known letters and explores new letters to narrow down possibilities.\n\n<guess>tares</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tares -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) A(✓) R(-) E(✓) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: - (in the word, but not in position 2)\n- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: - (in the word, but not in position 5)\n\nGuess 2: ""tares""\n- T: ✓ (correct, in position 1)\n- A: ✓ (correct, in position 2)\n- R: - (in the word, but not in position 3)\n- E: ✓ (correct, in position 4)\n- S: x (not in the word)\n\nSo, from this, we know:\n\n1. The first letter is T.\n2. The second letter is A.\n3. The fourth letter is E.\n4. The letter R is in the word, but not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 3 (from second guess). Therefore, R must be in position 5 (since positions 1, 2, 3, and 4 are either taken or ruled out for R? But position 1 is T, position 2 is A, position 4 is E, and position 3 is not R. So the only position left is 5? But wait, the word has 5 letters, so position 5 is the only possibility? However, we must confirm: the secret word has R, and it cannot be in positions 2 or 3. Position 1 is T (so not R), position 2 is A (so not R), position 4 is E (so not R). Therefore, R must be in position 5.\n\nBut let\'s double-check: the feedback for ""tares"" has R marked as present but wrong position. In ""tares"", R is in position 3. Since we now know that position 3 is not R, and we also know from the first guess that position 2 is not R, and positions 1, 2, and 4 are fixed as T, A, E, then indeed R must be in position 5.\n\nAdditionally, we know that S is not in the word.\n\nAlso, from the first guess, we know that C and N are not in the word.\n\nSo, the secret word so far is: T A _ E _\n\nAnd we know the fifth letter must be R? But wait, we have to confirm: the feedback for the second guess shows that R is present but not in position 3, and we have fixed positions 1,2,4. The only unknown position is 3 and 5. But position 5 is available. However, we must consider that the word might have more than one R? But the feedback doesn\'t indicate that. But it\'s possible. However, the feedback for ""crane"" had R in position 2 and it was marked as present (but wrong position). In ""tares"", R is in position 3 and marked as present (wrong position). So if R were in position 5, then in ""tares"", the R in position 3 would be an extra R? But the secret word might have only one R. However, we don\'t know for sure.\n\nBut let\'s think: if the secret word has R only in position 5, then in ""tares"", the R in position 3 would be an incorrect position (which it is, as per feedback) and the R in position 5 would be correct? But in ""tares"", we don\'t have a letter in position 5? ""tares"" is T-A-R-E-S, so position 5 is S. We don\'t have a letter in position 5 for R. So the feedback for R is only about the R in position 3. Therefore, the secret word has an R, but it\'s not in position 3. And we know it\'s not in position 2. And positions 1,2,4 are fixed as T,A,E. So the only position left is 5. Therefore, the fifth letter must be R.\n\nBut what about the third letter? We don\'t know it yet.\n\nSo the word is: T A ? E R\n\nBut wait, that would be five letters: position1: T, position2: A, position3: ?, position4: E, position5: R.\n\nNow, we need to find the third letter.\n\nWe also know from the first guess that the word contains R, A, E (which we have) and we know C and N are not in the word. Also, S is not in the word (from second guess).\n\nIn the first guess, we had ""crane"" and we know that the secret word has R, A, E. Now we have T, A, E, R, and one missing letter in position 3.\n\nWhat letters are possible for position 3?\n\nWe know the secret word does not contain: C, N, S (and also the letters that were not present in the feedback, but we don\'t have a full list).\n\nFrom the two guesses, we have used: C, R, A, N, E, T, S.\n\nWe know C, N, S are absent.\n\nThe letter in position 3 must be a letter that is not C, N, S, and also not T, A, E, R? But T, A, E, R are already in the word, but they can be repeated? However, we don\'t have any indication of repeated letters so far.\n\nBut let\'s check: in the first guess, we had no repeated letters, and in the second guess, we had T, A, R, E, S (all distinct). The secret word: we have T, A, E, R and one more. If the secret word has no repeated letters, then the third letter must be a new letter that we haven\'t tried.\n\nBut we don\'t know if there are repeated letters. However, since we have no feedback indicating a repeated letter (for example, if a letter is repeated and one is correct and the other is not, it might show multiple marks), but in this case, we don\'t have that.\n\nBut to be safe, we should consider that the third letter could be a letter we haven\'t tried, or it could be one of the existing letters? But we have T, A, E, R already. If the third letter is one of these, then it would be a duplicate.\n\nFor example, if the third letter is T, then the word would be T A T E R. But that might be a valid word? ""tater"" (a potato). Similarly, if it\'s A, then ""taaer"" is not a word. If it\'s E, ""taeer"" not a word. If it\'s R, then ""tarer"" (one who tares) is a word? But let\'s see.\n\nBut we have to consider the feedback from the first guess. In ""crane"", we had A in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. But if the secret word has A in position 2 (which is fixed) and also in position 3? Then in ""crane"", the A in position 3 would be correct? But it was marked as wrong position. So that means the secret word does not have A in position 3, but it does have an A. Since we now know A is in position 2, then if there were a second A, it could be in position 3? But the feedback for ""crane"" would have marked the A as correct if it were in position 3? But it was marked as wrong position, meaning that the A is in the word but not in position 3. That doesn\'t preclude a second A? Actually, if there were two A\'s, and one is in position 2 (which we now know) and one in position 3, then in ""crane"", the A in position 3 would be correct and should be marked as correct (✓), but it was marked as wrong position (-). Therefore, the secret word does not have an A in position 3. So if the secret word has only one A, then we know that. Similarly, for other letters.\n\nBut in our case, for the third position, if we put A, it would be incorrect because we know A is in position 2 and the feedback from ""crane"" showed that position 3 is not A. Similarly, for T: in the first guess, we didn\'t have T. In the second guess, T is in position 1 and correct. If we put T in position 3, then the word would have two T\'s? But in the second guess, we only had one T and it was in position 1. The feedback didn\'t show any other T? The feedback for ""tares"" had T as correct in position 1, and the other letters: A correct, R wrong, E correct, S absent. There was no indication of another T? But if the secret word had a T in position 3, then in ""tares"", we only have one T (in position 1) and the secret word has two T\'s, so the feedback wouldn\'t show the second T because we didn\'t guess it. So it\'s possible.\n\nSimilarly for E: we have E in position 4. If we put E in position 3, then the word would be T A E E R. But in the first guess, we had E in position 5 and it was marked as wrong position. If the secret word has E in position 4 and also in position 3, then in ""crane"", the E in position 5 would be one of the E\'s? But the feedback marked it as wrong position, meaning that the E is in the word but not in position 5. It doesn\'t say anything about position 3. However, in the second guess, we have E in position 4 and it\'s correct. So if we put E in position 3, then the secret word has two E\'s. But we don\'t have feedback that rules that out.\n\nSimilarly for R: we think R is in position 5. If we put R in position 3, then the word would be T A R E R. But in the first guess, we had R in position 2 and it was marked as wrong position. If the secret word has R in position 3 and 5, then in ""crane"", the R in position 2 would be wrong, which is consistent. In ""tares"", we have R in position 3 and it was marked as wrong position? But if the secret word has R in position 3, then in ""tares"", the R in position 3 should be correct (✓), but it was marked as wrong position (-). Therefore, the secret word does not have R in position 3. So R cannot be in position 3.\n\nTherefore, for position 3, we cannot have R (because of the feedback from ""tares"": R in position 3 is wrong). We cannot have A (because of feedback from ""crane"": A in position 3 is wrong). We cannot have T? We don\'t have direct feedback, but if we put T in position 3, it would be a duplicate. Similarly for E.\n\nBut duplicates are allowed? The word could have duplicate letters.\n\nHowever, we have to consider the feedback.\n\nLet me summarize the constraints for position 3:\n\n- It cannot be C, N, S (absent letters).\n- It cannot be A (because in ""crane"", A in position 3 was marked as wrong, and we now know A is in position 2, so if there were a second A, the feedback in ""crane"" would have shown it as correct? But wait, no: if there is a second A, and we guessed A in position 3, and the secret word has A in position 2 and 3, then the A in position 3 would be correct and should be marked as correct (✓). But in ""crane"", it was marked as wrong position (-). Therefore, the secret word does not have an A in position 3. So even if there is a second A, it cannot be in position 3. But we don\'t know if there is a second A. However, for position 3, we cannot put A because it would be incorrect (as per feedback).\n\nSimilarly, we cannot put R in position 3 because in ""tares"", R in position 3 was marked as wrong, meaning the secret word does not have R in position 3.\n\nFor T: we don\'t have any feedback that says T cannot be in position 3. Similarly for E.\n\nBut we also have to consider that the secret word might not have duplicate letters.\n\nGiven that, it might be more efficient to assume no duplicates for now and try a new letter.\n\nBut we have to consider all possibilities.\n\nHowever, we have only 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We have 3 more after this? Actually, we have used 2, so we have 4 left? But we need to solve it.\n\nThe word is T A ? E R, and we need to find the missing letter.\n\nPossible letters: any letter except C, N, S, and also excluding A and R for position 3 (as explained). But T and E are possible if duplicated.\n\nBut let\'s list possible words.\n\nCommon words that fit T A _ E R:\n\n- TAPER (a candle or to narrow)\n- TAMER (one who tames)\n- TASER (a stun gun) but S is absent, so not possible.\n- TAXER (one who taxes)\n- TABER (a type of dance? not common)\n- TAGER? not a word.\n- TALER? a coin, but not common.\n- TARER? but R is in position 5, and if we put R in position 3, we cannot because of feedback.\n\nBut we cannot have R in position 3.\n\nSimilarly, TATER (potato) - T A T E R, which has T in position 1 and 3.\n\nIs that possible? Let\'s check against feedback.\n\nFirst guess ""crane"": no T, so no issue.\n\nSecond guess ""tares"": we have T in position 1 (correct), A in 2 (correct), R in 3 (wrong), E in 4 (correct), S in 5 (absent). If the secret word is ""tater"", then:\n\n- T in position 1: correct (matches)\n- A in position 2: correct (matches)\n- R in position 3: in ""tares"" we guessed R in 3, but in ""tater"" position 3 is T, not R. So R is not in position 3, which is consistent with the feedback (wrong position). But the secret word ""tater"" has R in position 5. In ""tares"", we did not guess any R in position 5? We guessed S in position 5. So the feedback for R: we have one R in the guess (position 3) and the secret word has one R (position 5). Since the positions are different, it should be marked as present but wrong position, which it was. Also, S is absent, which is correct.\n\nSo ""tater"" is a possible word.\n\nAnother possibility: ""taper"" - T A P E R.\n\nCheck against feedback:\n\nFirst guess: no P, so no issue.\n\nSecond guess: ""tares"" vs ""taper"": \n- T: correct\n- A: correct\n- R: in ""tares"" we have R in 3, but in ""taper"" position 3 is P, not R. The R is in position 5. So the R in the guess (position 3) is not in the secret word at position 3, and the secret word has R in position 5. So the feedback should be R present but wrong position, which matches. S is absent, correct.\n\nSimilarly, ""tamer"": T A M E R.\n\nSame logic: M is new, R in position 5.\n\nNow, what about ""taxer"": T A X E R.\n\nX is a letter.\n\nBut we need to see if it\'s valid.\n\nAlso, are there words with E in position 3? Like ""taeer"" is not a word. ""Taker"" would be T A K E R, but K is a letter.\n\n""Taker"" is a word.\n\nBut let\'s list all possible common words:\n\n- taper\n- tamer\n- taker\n- taxer\n- taber (less common)\n- taler (less common)\n- tater\n\nBut we need to figure out which one.\n\nWe have to make a guess that can distinguish these.\n\nBut we have only one letter missing, so we can try to guess one of these.\n\nHowever, we have 4 more guesses, so we can try a word that includes several of the possible letters.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know the third letter, and we have multiple options.\n\nWe can use a guess that tests multiple possibilities.\n\nBut since we know the first, second, fourth, and fifth letters, and only the third is missing, we can try to guess one of the common ones.\n\nBut we have to be careful: if we guess wrong, we use a try.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that has a new letter in position 3 and also includes other letters to test, but we already know four letters.\n\nBut we don\'t have to use the known letters? We can, but we can also use a word that has the known letters in the correct positions and a new letter in position 3.\n\nBut we don\'t have many letters left to test? We have used: C, R, A, N, E, T, S.\n\nAbsent: C, N, S.\n\nPresent: T, A, E, R, and one more.\n\nThe remaining letters are almost the entire alphabet minus a few.\n\nBut we can try a word that has T, A, E, R in the correct positions and a new letter in position 3.\n\nBut that\'s exactly what we are going to do: guess a word like ""taper"" or ""tamer"", etc.\n\nBut we need to choose one.\n\nTo maximize information, we might choose a word that has a common letter that appears in many possible words? But all are different.\n\nSince we are not sure, we can choose a word that uses a letter we haven\'t tried, so that if it\'s wrong, we get information about that letter.\n\nFor example, if we guess ""taper"", and it\'s wrong, then we know P is not in the word, and then we can try another.\n\nSimilarly for ""tamer"", we test M.\n\nBut we have to start somewhere.\n\nLet\'s see the frequency of letters. Common letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... but we have used E, T, A, R. N and S are out. So O, I, L, U, D, etc.\n\nIn the possible words:\n\n- taper: P\n- tamer: M\n- taker: K\n- taxer: X\n- taber: B\n- taler: L\n- tater: T (duplicate)\n\nT is already in the word, so ""tater"" has a duplicate T.\n\nWe can try ""tater"" first because it uses a letter we already know is present (T), so if it\'s wrong, we know that the third letter is not T, and then we can try others.\n\nBut we know T is in position 1, but it might be duplicated.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t duplicate, to test a new letter.\n\nI think it\'s better to test a new letter.\n\nLet me choose ""taper"" because P is a common letter.\n\nSo guess: ""taper""\n\nBut let\'s confirm the feedback we would get if the word is ""taper"":\n\n- T: correct (position 1)\n- A: correct (position 2)\n- P: new letter, if it is in the word, but in ""taper"" we have P in position 3. If the secret word is ""taper"", then P would be correct. If not, then if P is in the word but wrong position, or absent.\n\nBut we are guessing to see.\n\nWe can also consider that in the first guess, we had no P, so if P were in the word, it would have been detected? No, because we didn\'t guess P in the first guess.\n\nSimilarly, second guess no P.\n\nSo we don\'t know about P.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""taper"".\n\nBut let\'s see if there is a word that can test multiple letters at once? But we only have one position unknown, so we can\'t test multiple.\n\nUnless we use a word that doesn\'t have the known letters in the correct positions? But that might be inefficient.\n\nFor example, we could guess a word that has the third letter and also tests other positions, but we already know four positions are fixed. So it\'s better to fix the known positions and only vary the unknown.\n\nTherefore, I think ""taper"" is a good guess.\n\nSo the third guess is ""taper"".\n\nBut note: if the secret word is ""tater"", then by guessing ""taper"", we will get:\n\n- T: ✓\n- A: ✓\n- P: x (if ""tater"" has T, not P)\n- E: ✓\n- R: ✓\n\nBut we would know that P is absent, and then we can try ""tater"" next.\n\nSimilarly, if it\'s ""tamer"", then P would be absent, and we try M next.\n\nBut we can also consider guessing ""tater"" directly to save a guess if it\'s correct.\n\nBut we don\'t know.\n\nSince ""tater"" is a common word, and we have T, A, E, R, and duplicate T, it might be likely.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback from the first guess: in ""crane"", we had E in position 5 marked as wrong. If the secret word is ""tater"", then E is in position 4, so in ""crane"", E in position 5 is wrong, which is consistent.\n\nSimilarly for ""taper"".\n\nI think both are possible.\n\nBut to be safe, let\'s choose a word that doesn\'t duplicate letters first, so we test a new letter.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""taper"".\n\n<guess>taper</guess>### Analysis of Feedback and Reasoning for Next Guess\n\n#### Step-by-Step Thought Process:\n1. **Current Known Information from Feedback**:\n   - **Guess 1 (""crane"")**:\n     - C: Absent (x) → C is not in the secret word.\n     - R: Present, wrong position (-) → R is in the word, but not in position 2.\n     - A: Present, wrong position (-) → A is in the word, but not in position 3.\n     - N: Absent (x) → N is not in the word.\n     - E: Present, wrong position (-) → E is in the word, but not in position 5.\n   - **Guess 2 (""tares"")**:\n     - T: Correct position (✓) → T is in position 1.\n     - A: Correct position (✓) → A is in position 2.\n     - R: Present, wrong position (-) → R is in the word, but not in position 3.\n     - E: Correct position (✓) → E is in position 4.\n     - S: Absent (x) → S is not in the word.\n   - **Inferences**:\n     - The secret word starts with **T**, followed by **A** in position 2, and **E** in position 4 (i.e., the word pattern is `T A _ E _`).\n     - **R must be in position 5**: \n       - R is confirmed present but cannot be in position 2 (from Guess 1) or position 3 (from Guess 2). Positions 1, 2, and 4 are occupied by T, A, and E, so R must be in position 5. Thus, the word pattern is now `T A _ E R`.\n     - **Absent letters**: C, N, and S are eliminated.\n     - **Position 3 constraints**:\n       - Cannot be A (A is fixed in position 2, and Guess 1 ruled out position 3 for A).\n       - Cannot be R (ruled out for position 3 by Guess 2).\n       - Cannot be C, N, or S (absent letters).\n       - Could be a duplicate of T or E (if the word has repeats), or a new letter not yet tested.\n\n2. **Possible Words**:\n   - The secret word must match `T A _ E R`. Common English words fitting this pattern include:\n     - **TAPER** (e.g., to narrow or a candle): Uses P, a new letter.\n     - **TAMER** (e.g., one who tames): Uses M, a new letter.\n     - **TAKER** (e.g., one who takes): Uses K, a new letter.\n     - **TATER** (e.g., informal for potato): Uses a duplicate T (position 3).\n     - Less common options like **TABER** or **TAXER** are also possible but lower frequency.\n   - **Key Insight**: The third letter is the only unknown. We need to test it efficiently.\n\n3. **Strategy for Guess 3**:\n   - **Goal**: Test the third position with a high-likelihood word that either solves the puzzle or provides new information.\n   - **Why not guess a word with duplicates (like ""tater"") yet?** \n     - If ""tater"" is incorrect, we learn nothing new about other letters (e.g., P, M, K). Guessing a word with a new letter (e.g., P in ""taper"") tests for both the presence of that letter and its position.\n   - **Why ""taper""?** \n     - It uses **P**, a common letter not yet tested (maximizes information gain).\n     - If correct, we solve the puzzle. If incorrect, we learn whether P is present/absent, narrowing the list of possible words (e.g., if P is absent, ""tamer"" or ""taker"" become top candidates).\n     - It fits the pattern `T A _ E R` with P in position 3, avoiding ruled-out positions/letters.\n   - **Efficiency**: With 4 guesses remaining, this approach balances solving potential with information gain. If ""taper"" is wrong, feedback on P will quickly eliminate options.\n\n4. **Final Decision**: \n   - Guess **""taper""** to test P in position 3. If feedback shows P is correct, the word is solved. If P is absent, we pivot to other candidates like ""tamer"" or ""tater"" next.\n\n<guess>taper</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tares -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) A(✓) R(-) E(✓) S(x)\nGuess 3: taper -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) A(✓) P(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from Guess 3: ""taper""
- T: ✓ (correct in position 1)
- A: ✓ (correct in position 2)
- P: x (absent from the word)
- E: ✓ (correct in position 4)
- R: ✓ (correct in position 5)

Given this, we know:
- The secret word is T A _ E R (positions 1,2,4,5 confirmed as T,A,E,R).
- P is not in the word (newly eliminated letter).
- The third letter is still unknown.

From previous feedback, we also know:
- C, N, S, P are absent.
- R, A, E have been placed correctly in positions 5, 2, 4 respectively.

Possible candidates for the third letter:
- It must be a letter that forms a valid English word with ""T A _ E R"".
- It cannot be C, N, S, P (absent).
- It cannot be A or R (due to position constraints: A is fixed at position 2 and cannot be duplicated in position 3 based on earlier feedback; R is fixed at position 5 and feedback ruled out position 3 for R).

Common words fitting the pattern:
- **TAMER** (M in position 3)
- **TAKER** (K in position 3)
- **TATER** (T in position 3, duplicate) - note ""tater"" is informal for potato
- **TABER** (B in position 3) - less common
- **TAXER** (X in position 3)

However, we must consider the possibility of a duplicate T. In Guess 3 (""taper""):
- We guessed P (absent) and had T in position 1, which is correct. 
- If the secret word has T in position 3 (like in ""tater""), the feedback does not indicate duplicate T because we only guessed T once (in position 1). So ""tater"" is still plausible.

But we also have earlier feedback to consider:
- Guess 1 (""crane"") had no T, so no issue.
- Guess 2 (""tares"") had T in position 1 (correct) and no other T guessed.

Now, we have four possible common words: ""tamer"", ""taker"", ""tater"", ""taxer"".

Strategy:
- We need to test the third position efficiently.
- Since we have limited guesses, pick a word that tests multiple possibilities or a high-frequency letter.

Option 1: Guess ""tater"" to test for duplicate T. If correct, solved. If incorrect, we know T is not duplicated, so the third letter must be new (like M, K, X).

Option 2: Guess a word with M or K to isolate candidates. For instance, ""tamer"" tests M.

However, to preserve guesses, we can guess ""tater"" because it's common and resolves the duplicate question immediately.

After ""tater"":
- If incorrect, feedback will show position 3 as ✓ if T is correct? But wait, ""tater"" has T in position 3. If the word is ""tater"", we get all correct. If not, then:
  - T is not in position 3 (but may be present elsewhere? We know T is fixed at position 1), but specifically, the third letter is not T.
  - Since P is absent and T would be tested in position 3 (and if wrong, we know no duplicate T in position 3), then we can try other letters.

But perhaps better to test a new letter first? Since if ""tater"" is wrong, we still know only that T isn't duplicated in position 3. We don't learn about other letters.

If we guess ""tamer"":
- If correct, solved.
- If incorrect, then M is absent (x) or possibly misplaced? But the word pattern is fixed except position 3. If ""tamer"" is wrong, then:
  - Feedback: T(✓), A(✓), M(?), E(✓), R(✓). The ? tells us if M is present or absent.
  - If M is absent, we eliminate M and can focus on other letters like K or X.

Similarly, guessing ""taker"" tests K.

Given that ""tater"" is a simple and common word, I'll prioritize that.

So next guess: ""tater""

<guess>tater</guess>
After analyzing the feedback:
- **Pattern confirmed**: Positions 1 (T), 2 (A), 4 (E), and 5 (R) are fixed. Only position 3 is unknown.
- **Absent letters**: C, N, S, P (per previous feedback).
- **Guess 3 (""taper"")** ruled out P and confirmed all other letters except position 3.

**Possible words for `T A _ E R`**:
- **TAMER** (M in position 3)
- **TAKER** (K in position 3)
- **TATER** (T in position 3, duplicate)
- Other rare options like **TABER** or **TAXER**.

**Reasoning for ""tater""**:
- **High probability**: ""Tater"" is a common informal word for potato. Testing for a duplicate T in position 3 is efficient because:
  - If correct (✓), the puzzle is solved.
  - If incorrect (e.g., third letter is not T), we:
    - Learn T is not duplicated (or not in position 3, specifically).
    - Eliminate ""tater"" to focus on less common options like ""tamer"" or ""taker"".
- **Efficiency**: With 3 guesses remaining, solving faster is ideal. Testing a duplicate letter resolves ambiguity early.

This guess maximizes the chance of solving immediately while minimizing risk.
</think>
After reviewing the feedback from Guess 3 (""taper""):
- **T(✓)**, **A(✓)**, **E(✓)**, **R(✓)**: These confirm positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 are **T**, **A**, **E**, and **R**, respectively.  
- **P(x)**: P is **absent** from the secret word (newly eliminated).  
- The secret word pattern is **T A _ E R**, with only position 3 unknown.  

### Key Constraints:
1. **Eliminated letters**: C, N, S (from prior feedback), and P (newly eliminated).  
2. **Position 3 cannot be**:  
   - A (fixed in position 2, and Guess 1 ruled out position 3 for A).  
   - R (fixed in position 5, and Guess 2 ruled out position 3 for R).  
3. **Possible candidates** for position 3:  
   - **T** (duplicate, e.g., ""tater"" = potato).  
   - **M** (e.g., ""tamer"" = one who tames).  
   - **K** (e.g., ""taker"" = one who takes).  
   - Less common options like **B** (""taber"") or **X** (""taxer"").  

### Reasoning for Next Guess:
- **Why ""tater""?**  
  - It tests **T** in position 3—a likely duplicate letter given frequency.  
  - If correct, the puzzle is solved.  
  - If incorrect, we:  
    - Confirm T is **not duplicated** (narrowing to options like ""tamer""/""taker"").  
    - Preserve common letters (M/K) for future guesses.  
- **Efficiency**: With 3 guesses left, prioritizing ""tater"" resolves the duplicate-T question immediately. Testing less common letters first (e.g., M/K) risks wasting a guess if T is the solution.  

<guess>tater</guess>",tater,"We have feedback from Guess 3: ""taper""
- T: ✓ (correct in position 1)
- A: ✓ (correct in position 2)
- P: x (absent from the word)
- E: ✓ (correct in position 4)
- R: ✓ (correct in position 5)

Given this, we know:
- The secret word is T A _ E R (positions 1,2,4,5 confirmed as T,A,E,R).
- P is not in the word (newly eliminated letter).
- The third letter is still unknown.

From previous feedback, we also know:
- C, N, S, P are absent.
- R, A, E have been placed correctly in positions 5, 2, 4 respectively.

Possible candidates for the third letter:
- It must be a letter that forms a valid English word with ""T A _ E R"".
- It cannot be C, N, S, P (absent).
- It cannot be A or R (due to position constraints: A is fixed at position 2 and cannot be duplicated in position 3 based on earlier feedback; R is fixed at position 5 and feedback ruled out position 3 for R).

Common words fitting the pattern:
- **TAMER** (M in position 3)
- **TAKER** (K in position 3)
- **TATER** (T in position 3, duplicate) - note ""tater"" is informal for potato
- **TABER** (B in position 3) - less common
- **TAXER** (X in position 3)

However, we must consider the possibility of a duplicate T. In Guess 3 (""taper""):
- We guessed P (absent) and had T in position 1, which is correct. 
- If the secret word has T in position 3 (like in ""tater""), the feedback does not indicate duplicate T because we only guessed T once (in position 1). So ""tater"" is still plausible.

But we also have earlier feedback to consider:
- Guess 1 (""crane"") had no T, so no issue.
- Guess 2 (""tares"") had T in position 1 (correct) and no other T guessed.

Now, we have four possible common words: ""tamer"", ""taker"", ""tater"", ""taxer"".

Strategy:
- We need to test the third position efficiently.
- Since we have limited guesses, pick a word that tests multiple possibilities or a high-frequency letter.

Option 1: Guess ""tater"" to test for duplicate T. If correct, solved. If incorrect, we know T is not duplicated, so the third letter must be new (like M, K, X).

Option 2: Guess a word with M or K to isolate candidates. For instance, ""tamer"" tests M.

However, to preserve guesses, we can guess ""tater"" because it's common and resolves the duplicate question immediately.

After ""tater"":
- If incorrect, feedback will show position 3 as ✓ if T is correct? But wait, ""tater"" has T in position 3. If the word is ""tater"", we get all correct. If not, then:
  - T is not in position 3 (but may be present elsewhere? We know T is fixed at position 1), but specifically, the third letter is not T.
  - Since P is absent and T would be tested in position 3 (and if wrong, we know no duplicate T in position 3), then we can try other letters.

But perhaps better to test a new letter first? Since if ""tater"" is wrong, we still know only that T isn't duplicated in position 3. We don't learn about other letters.

If we guess ""tamer"":
- If correct, solved.
- If incorrect, then M is absent (x) or possibly misplaced? But the word pattern is fixed except position 3. If ""tamer"" is wrong, then:
  - Feedback: T(✓), A(✓), M(?), E(✓), R(✓). The ? tells us if M is present or absent.
  - If M is absent, we eliminate M and can focus on other letters like K or X.

Similarly, guessing ""taker"" tests K.

Given that ""tater"" is a simple and common word, I'll prioritize that.

So next guess: ""tater""

<guess>tater</guess>
After analyzing the feedback:
- **Pattern confirmed**: Positions 1 (T), 2 (A), 4 (E), and 5 (R) are fixed. Only position 3 is unknown.
- **Absent letters**: C, N, S, P (per previous feedback).
- **Guess 3 (""taper"")** ruled out P and confirmed all other letters except position 3.

**Possible words for `T A _ E R`**:
- **TAMER** (M in position 3)
- **TAKER** (K in position 3)
- **TATER** (T in position 3, duplicate)
- Other rare options like **TABER** or **TAXER**.

**Reasoning for ""tater""**:
- **High probability**: ""Tater"" is a common informal word for potato. Testing for a duplicate T in position 3 is efficient because:
  - If correct (✓), the puzzle is solved.
  - If incorrect (e.g., third letter is not T), we:
    - Learn T is not duplicated (or not in position 3, specifically).
    - Eliminate ""tater"" to focus on less common options like ""tamer"" or ""taker"".
- **Efficiency**: With 3 guesses remaining, solving faster is ideal. Testing a duplicate letter resolves ambiguity early.

This guess maximizes the chance of solving immediately while minimizing risk.After reviewing the feedback from Guess 3 (""taper""):
- **T(✓)**, **A(✓)**, **E(✓)**, **R(✓)**: These confirm positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 are **T**, **A**, **E**, and **R**, respectively.  
- **P(x)**: P is **absent** from the secret word (newly eliminated).  
- The secret word pattern is **T A _ E R**, with only position 3 unknown.  

### Key Constraints:
1. **Eliminated letters**: C, N, S (from prior feedback), and P (newly eliminated).  
2. **Position 3 cannot be**:  
   - A (fixed in position 2, and Guess 1 ruled out position 3 for A).  
   - R (fixed in position 5, and Guess 2 ruled out position 3 for R).  
3. **Possible candidates** for position 3:  
   - **T** (duplicate, e.g., ""tater"" = potato).  
   - **M** (e.g., ""tamer"" = one who tames).  
   - **K** (e.g., ""taker"" = one who takes).  
   - Less common options like **B** (""taber"") or **X** (""taxer"").  

### Reasoning for Next Guess:
- **Why ""tater""?**  
  - It tests **T** in position 3—a likely duplicate letter given frequency.  
  - If correct, the puzzle is solved.  
  - If incorrect, we:  
    - Confirm T is **not duplicated** (narrowing to options like ""tamer""/""taker"").  
    - Preserve common letters (M/K) for future guesses.  
- **Efficiency**: With 3 guesses left, prioritizing ""tater"" resolves the duplicate-T question immediately. Testing less common letters first (e.g., M/K) risks wasting a guess if T is the solution.",Guess 4: tater -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) A(✓) T(-) E(✓) R(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,5,TAMER,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all are distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the secret word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the secret word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R, A, and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
 - The secret word does not contain C or N.

 Since R, A, and E are in the word, we should try to use them again in different positions.

 Also, note that in ""crane"", the positions were:
  1: C (x)
  2: R (but should be elsewhere) -> so R cannot be in position 2
  3: A (but should be elsewhere) -> so A cannot be in position 3
  4: N (x)
  5: E (but should be elsewhere) -> so E cannot be in position 5

 We have 6 tries, so we can use a second guess to test new positions for R, A, E and also try to include other common letters.

 We must avoid using C and N.

 Let's think of a word that includes R, A, E and two new letters (preferably common ones) and places R, A, E in positions different from the first guess.

 Constraints for the next guess:
  - Avoid position 2 for R, position 3 for A, position 5 for E.
  - The word must not contain C or N.

 We can try to put R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: we know R is in the word but not in position 2. Similarly, A not in 3, E not in 5.

 However, we don't know the exact positions yet.

 Let's try to form a word that has:
  - R in a new position (say position 1 or 4 or 5? but note we have to avoid position 2)
  - A in a new position (not 3, so 1,2,4,5)
  - E in a new position (not 5, so 1,2,3,4)

 Also, we want to test new letters. Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, etc.

 We can try a word that starts with R? But note: we don't know if R is at the beginning.

 Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has R, A, E and two new letters.

 Example words: 
  ""RAISE"" - but note: 
    R at position 1 (which is new for R, since previously it was at 2) -> allowed
    A at position 2 (previously at 3, so 2 is new) -> allowed
    I is new
    S is new
    E at position 5 -> but feedback said E is not in position 5? Actually, the feedback for E was that it is in the word but not in position 5. So we cannot put E at position 5 again? Actually, we can, but we know it's not correct because the feedback said it's not in position 5. So we should avoid putting E at position 5.

 Therefore, ""RAISE"" has E at position 5, which we know is wrong. So we avoid that.

 Another word: ""ROATE"" (a valid word? yes, meaning to grow or increase) but:
  R at 1 -> new
  O at 2 -> new
  A at 3 -> but we know A is not at position 3? Actually, the feedback for A was that it is in the word but not at position 3. So we cannot put A at 3 again? We can, but we know it's not the correct position. However, we are trying to test new positions. Also, E is at 5 again, which we know is wrong.

 So avoid ""ROATE"" for the same reason.

 Let's try ""STARE"":
  S at 1 -> new
  T at 2 -> new
  A at 3 -> but we know A is not at 3? So we shouldn't put A at 3? Actually, we can put it to test, but we already know it's not the correct position. However, we are trying to get new information. But we have to avoid known wrong positions? Actually, we can put a letter in a known wrong position again? But that would be inefficient because we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting A at position 3.

 Therefore, we need a word that has:
  R not at 2
  A not at 3
  E not at 5

 And we want to test new letters.

 Let me try ""LATER"":
  L at 1 -> new
  A at 2 -> new position for A (previously at 3, now at 2) -> allowed
  T at 3 -> new
  E at 4 -> new position for E (previously at 5, now at 4) -> allowed
  R at 5 -> new position for R (previously at 2, now at 5) -> allowed

 This word uses L and T as new letters, and places A, E, R in positions that are not the ones we know are wrong.

 Also, we avoid C and N.

 So ""LATER"" is a good candidate.

 But note: we have to make sure it's a valid word.

 Alternatively, ""RATEL"" (a honey badger) but that might be less common.

 Another common word: ""ALTER"" - similar to ""LATER"", but with A at 1 and L at 2? But then A is at 1, which is new.

 However, let's stick with ""LATER"".

 But wait: we have to consider that the secret word has R, A, E. In ""LATER"", we have:
  L (new), A (known, at position 2), T (new), E (known, at position 4), R (known, at position 5).

 This covers two new letters and repositions the known letters.

 Alternatively, we can try ""TARES"" (a valid word, meaning weed or a unit of weight) but that has 5 letters? T-A-R-E-S.

  T at 1 -> new
  A at 2 -> new for A (previously at 3, now at 2) -> allowed
  R at 3 -> but we know R is not at position 2? But position 3 is new for R. However, we don't have a constraint on R at 3? Only that it's not at 2. So R at 3 is allowed.
  E at 4 -> new for E (previously at 5, now at 4) -> allowed
  S at 5 -> new

 This also seems good.

 But note: we have two known letters (A and R) in positions we haven't tested? Actually, we are testing new positions.

 However, we have to choose one.

 Let me compare:
  ""LATER"": tests L and T, and positions 2 for A, 4 for E, 5 for R.
  ""TARES"": tests T, S, and positions 2 for A, 3 for R, 4 for E.

 We might get more information from ""TARES"" because it has S at the end, which is a common letter.

 But note: we are limited by the fact that we know the word has R, A, E and two other letters (which are not C or N).

 I think both are valid. Let's choose ""TARES"" because it has more common letters? Or because it tests R in a new position (3) and we haven't tested that.

 Alternatively, we can choose ""STARE"" but then A is at 3 which we know is wrong? So we avoid that.

 Actually, we can adjust ""STARE"" to avoid A at 3? But we can't because the word is fixed.

 So let's go with ""TARES"".

 But note: the feedback for the first guess had R at position 2 as wrong, but that doesn't mean R cannot be at other positions? We are free to test.

 However, we are trying to maximize information.

 Another candidate: ""ARISE"" - but E is at 5 again? So avoid.

 How about ""RAISE"" but E at 5? Avoid.

 How about ""SERAI"" (an inn) but that might be too obscure.

 Let me stick with ""TARES"".

 But wait, what about ""REACT""? But we know C is not in the word, so we cannot use C.

 So ""TARES"" is valid.

 Alternatively, ""PARSE"": 
  P at 1 -> new
  A at 2 -> new for A (allowed)
  R at 3 -> new for R (allowed)
  S at 4 -> new
  E at 5 -> but we know E is not at 5? So avoid.

 Therefore, ""TARES"" seems good.

 But note: we have to make sure that the word is in the word list. Since the game uses valid English words, and ""tares"" is a valid word, we can use it.

 So second guess: ""TARES""

<guess>tares</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C** and **N** are absent from the secret word (marked `x`).
- **R**, **A**, and **E** are present but in incorrect positions (marked `-`). Specifically:
  - R cannot be in position 2.
  - A cannot be in position 3.
  - E cannot be in position 5.

For the next guess, I prioritized:
1. **Including known letters (R, A, E)** in new positions to test their correct placement.
2. **Avoiding C and N**.
3. **Introducing new common letters** (T, S) to maximize information.
4. **Avoiding positions ruled out** by the first guess.

The word **""tares""** fits these criteria:
- Places A in position 2 (new, not position 3).
- Places R in position 3 (new, not position 2).
- Places E in position 4 (new, not position 5).
- Introduces T (position 1) and S (position 5), both untested letters.
- Is a valid 5-letter English word.

This guess efficiently tests new positions for known letters and explores new letters to narrow down possibilities.

<guess>tares</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: tares -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) A(✓) R(-) E(✓) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but not in position 5)

Guess 2: ""tares""
- T: ✓ (correct, in position 1)
- A: ✓ (correct, in position 2)
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
- E: ✓ (correct, in position 4)
- S: x (not in the word)

So, from this, we know:

1. The first letter is T.
2. The second letter is A.
3. The fourth letter is E.
4. The letter R is in the word, but not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 3 (from second guess). Therefore, R must be in position 5 (since positions 1, 2, 3, and 4 are either taken or ruled out for R? But position 1 is T, position 2 is A, position 4 is E, and position 3 is not R. So the only position left is 5? But wait, the word has 5 letters, so position 5 is the only possibility? However, we must confirm: the secret word has R, and it cannot be in positions 2 or 3. Position 1 is T (so not R), position 2 is A (so not R), position 4 is E (so not R). Therefore, R must be in position 5.

But let's double-check: the feedback for ""tares"" has R marked as present but wrong position. In ""tares"", R is in position 3. Since we now know that position 3 is not R, and we also know from the first guess that position 2 is not R, and positions 1, 2, and 4 are fixed as T, A, E, then indeed R must be in position 5.

Additionally, we know that S is not in the word.

Also, from the first guess, we know that C and N are not in the word.

So, the secret word so far is: T A _ E _

And we know the fifth letter must be R? But wait, we have to confirm: the feedback for the second guess shows that R is present but not in position 3, and we have fixed positions 1,2,4. The only unknown position is 3 and 5. But position 5 is available. However, we must consider that the word might have more than one R? But the feedback doesn't indicate that. But it's possible. However, the feedback for ""crane"" had R in position 2 and it was marked as present (but wrong position). In ""tares"", R is in position 3 and marked as present (wrong position). So if R were in position 5, then in ""tares"", the R in position 3 would be an extra R? But the secret word might have only one R. However, we don't know for sure.

But let's think: if the secret word has R only in position 5, then in ""tares"", the R in position 3 would be an incorrect position (which it is, as per feedback) and the R in position 5 would be correct? But in ""tares"", we don't have a letter in position 5? ""tares"" is T-A-R-E-S, so position 5 is S. We don't have a letter in position 5 for R. So the feedback for R is only about the R in position 3. Therefore, the secret word has an R, but it's not in position 3. And we know it's not in position 2. And positions 1,2,4 are fixed as T,A,E. So the only position left is 5. Therefore, the fifth letter must be R.

But what about the third letter? We don't know it yet.

So the word is: T A ? E R

But wait, that would be five letters: position1: T, position2: A, position3: ?, position4: E, position5: R.

Now, we need to find the third letter.

We also know from the first guess that the word contains R, A, E (which we have) and we know C and N are not in the word. Also, S is not in the word (from second guess).

In the first guess, we had ""crane"" and we know that the secret word has R, A, E. Now we have T, A, E, R, and one missing letter in position 3.

What letters are possible for position 3?

We know the secret word does not contain: C, N, S (and also the letters that were not present in the feedback, but we don't have a full list).

From the two guesses, we have used: C, R, A, N, E, T, S.

We know C, N, S are absent.

The letter in position 3 must be a letter that is not C, N, S, and also not T, A, E, R? But T, A, E, R are already in the word, but they can be repeated? However, we don't have any indication of repeated letters so far.

But let's check: in the first guess, we had no repeated letters, and in the second guess, we had T, A, R, E, S (all distinct). The secret word: we have T, A, E, R and one more. If the secret word has no repeated letters, then the third letter must be a new letter that we haven't tried.

But we don't know if there are repeated letters. However, since we have no feedback indicating a repeated letter (for example, if a letter is repeated and one is correct and the other is not, it might show multiple marks), but in this case, we don't have that.

But to be safe, we should consider that the third letter could be a letter we haven't tried, or it could be one of the existing letters? But we have T, A, E, R already. If the third letter is one of these, then it would be a duplicate.

For example, if the third letter is T, then the word would be T A T E R. But that might be a valid word? ""tater"" (a potato). Similarly, if it's A, then ""taaer"" is not a word. If it's E, ""taeer"" not a word. If it's R, then ""tarer"" (one who tares) is a word? But let's see.

But we have to consider the feedback from the first guess. In ""crane"", we had A in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. But if the secret word has A in position 2 (which is fixed) and also in position 3? Then in ""crane"", the A in position 3 would be correct? But it was marked as wrong position. So that means the secret word does not have A in position 3, but it does have an A. Since we now know A is in position 2, then if there were a second A, it could be in position 3? But the feedback for ""crane"" would have marked the A as correct if it were in position 3? But it was marked as wrong position, meaning that the A is in the word but not in position 3. That doesn't preclude a second A? Actually, if there were two A's, and one is in position 2 (which we now know) and one in position 3, then in ""crane"", the A in position 3 would be correct and should be marked as correct (✓), but it was marked as wrong position (-). Therefore, the secret word does not have an A in position 3. So if the secret word has only one A, then we know that. Similarly, for other letters.

But in our case, for the third position, if we put A, it would be incorrect because we know A is in position 2 and the feedback from ""crane"" showed that position 3 is not A. Similarly, for T: in the first guess, we didn't have T. In the second guess, T is in position 1 and correct. If we put T in position 3, then the word would have two T's? But in the second guess, we only had one T and it was in position 1. The feedback didn't show any other T? The feedback for ""tares"" had T as correct in position 1, and the other letters: A correct, R wrong, E correct, S absent. There was no indication of another T? But if the secret word had a T in position 3, then in ""tares"", we only have one T (in position 1) and the secret word has two T's, so the feedback wouldn't show the second T because we didn't guess it. So it's possible.

Similarly for E: we have E in position 4. If we put E in position 3, then the word would be T A E E R. But in the first guess, we had E in position 5 and it was marked as wrong position. If the secret word has E in position 4 and also in position 3, then in ""crane"", the E in position 5 would be one of the E's? But the feedback marked it as wrong position, meaning that the E is in the word but not in position 5. It doesn't say anything about position 3. However, in the second guess, we have E in position 4 and it's correct. So if we put E in position 3, then the secret word has two E's. But we don't have feedback that rules that out.

Similarly for R: we think R is in position 5. If we put R in position 3, then the word would be T A R E R. But in the first guess, we had R in position 2 and it was marked as wrong position. If the secret word has R in position 3 and 5, then in ""crane"", the R in position 2 would be wrong, which is consistent. In ""tares"", we have R in position 3 and it was marked as wrong position? But if the secret word has R in position 3, then in ""tares"", the R in position 3 should be correct (✓), but it was marked as wrong position (-). Therefore, the secret word does not have R in position 3. So R cannot be in position 3.

Therefore, for position 3, we cannot have R (because of the feedback from ""tares"": R in position 3 is wrong). We cannot have A (because of feedback from ""crane"": A in position 3 is wrong). We cannot have T? We don't have direct feedback, but if we put T in position 3, it would be a duplicate. Similarly for E.

But duplicates are allowed? The word could have duplicate letters.

However, we have to consider the feedback.

Let me summarize the constraints for position 3:

- It cannot be C, N, S (absent letters).
- It cannot be A (because in ""crane"", A in position 3 was marked as wrong, and we now know A is in position 2, so if there were a second A, the feedback in ""crane"" would have shown it as correct? But wait, no: if there is a second A, and we guessed A in position 3, and the secret word has A in position 2 and 3, then the A in position 3 would be correct and should be marked as correct (✓). But in ""crane"", it was marked as wrong position (-). Therefore, the secret word does not have an A in position 3. So even if there is a second A, it cannot be in position 3. But we don't know if there is a second A. However, for position 3, we cannot put A because it would be incorrect (as per feedback).

Similarly, we cannot put R in position 3 because in ""tares"", R in position 3 was marked as wrong, meaning the secret word does not have R in position 3.

For T: we don't have any feedback that says T cannot be in position 3. Similarly for E.

But we also have to consider that the secret word might not have duplicate letters.

Given that, it might be more efficient to assume no duplicates for now and try a new letter.

But we have to consider all possibilities.

However, we have only 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We have 3 more after this? Actually, we have used 2, so we have 4 left? But we need to solve it.

The word is T A ? E R, and we need to find the missing letter.

Possible letters: any letter except C, N, S, and also excluding A and R for position 3 (as explained). But T and E are possible if duplicated.

But let's list possible words.

Common words that fit T A _ E R:

- TAPER (a candle or to narrow)
- TAMER (one who tames)
- TASER (a stun gun) but S is absent, so not possible.
- TAXER (one who taxes)
- TABER (a type of dance? not common)
- TAGER? not a word.
- TALER? a coin, but not common.
- TARER? but R is in position 5, and if we put R in position 3, we cannot because of feedback.

But we cannot have R in position 3.

Similarly, TATER (potato) - T A T E R, which has T in position 1 and 3.

Is that possible? Let's check against feedback.

First guess ""crane"": no T, so no issue.

Second guess ""tares"": we have T in position 1 (correct), A in 2 (correct), R in 3 (wrong), E in 4 (correct), S in 5 (absent). If the secret word is ""tater"", then:

- T in position 1: correct (matches)
- A in position 2: correct (matches)
- R in position 3: in ""tares"" we guessed R in 3, but in ""tater"" position 3 is T, not R. So R is not in position 3, which is consistent with the feedback (wrong position). But the secret word ""tater"" has R in position 5. In ""tares"", we did not guess any R in position 5? We guessed S in position 5. So the feedback for R: we have one R in the guess (position 3) and the secret word has one R (position 5). Since the positions are different, it should be marked as present but wrong position, which it was. Also, S is absent, which is correct.

So ""tater"" is a possible word.

Another possibility: ""taper"" - T A P E R.

Check against feedback:

First guess: no P, so no issue.

Second guess: ""tares"" vs ""taper"": 
- T: correct
- A: correct
- R: in ""tares"" we have R in 3, but in ""taper"" position 3 is P, not R. The R is in position 5. So the R in the guess (position 3) is not in the secret word at position 3, and the secret word has R in position 5. So the feedback should be R present but wrong position, which matches. S is absent, correct.

Similarly, ""tamer"": T A M E R.

Same logic: M is new, R in position 5.

Now, what about ""taxer"": T A X E R.

X is a letter.

But we need to see if it's valid.

Also, are there words with E in position 3? Like ""taeer"" is not a word. ""Taker"" would be T A K E R, but K is a letter.

""Taker"" is a word.

But let's list all possible common words:

- taper
- tamer
- taker
- taxer
- taber (less common)
- taler (less common)
- tater

But we need to figure out which one.

We have to make a guess that can distinguish these.

But we have only one letter missing, so we can try to guess one of these.

However, we have 4 more guesses, so we can try a word that includes several of the possible letters.

But note: we don't know the third letter, and we have multiple options.

We can use a guess that tests multiple possibilities.

But since we know the first, second, fourth, and fifth letters, and only the third is missing, we can try to guess one of the common ones.

But we have to be careful: if we guess wrong, we use a try.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has a new letter in position 3 and also includes other letters to test, but we already know four letters.

But we don't have to use the known letters? We can, but we can also use a word that has the known letters in the correct positions and a new letter in position 3.

But we don't have many letters left to test? We have used: C, R, A, N, E, T, S.

Absent: C, N, S.

Present: T, A, E, R, and one more.

The remaining letters are almost the entire alphabet minus a few.

But we can try a word that has T, A, E, R in the correct positions and a new letter in position 3.

But that's exactly what we are going to do: guess a word like ""taper"" or ""tamer"", etc.

But we need to choose one.

To maximize information, we might choose a word that has a common letter that appears in many possible words? But all are different.

Since we are not sure, we can choose a word that uses a letter we haven't tried, so that if it's wrong, we get information about that letter.

For example, if we guess ""taper"", and it's wrong, then we know P is not in the word, and then we can try another.

Similarly for ""tamer"", we test M.

But we have to start somewhere.

Let's see the frequency of letters. Common letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... but we have used E, T, A, R. N and S are out. So O, I, L, U, D, etc.

In the possible words:

- taper: P
- tamer: M
- taker: K
- taxer: X
- taber: B
- taler: L
- tater: T (duplicate)

T is already in the word, so ""tater"" has a duplicate T.

We can try ""tater"" first because it uses a letter we already know is present (T), so if it's wrong, we know that the third letter is not T, and then we can try others.

But we know T is in position 1, but it might be duplicated.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't duplicate, to test a new letter.

I think it's better to test a new letter.

Let me choose ""taper"" because P is a common letter.

So guess: ""taper""

But let's confirm the feedback we would get if the word is ""taper"":

- T: correct (position 1)
- A: correct (position 2)
- P: new letter, if it is in the word, but in ""taper"" we have P in position 3. If the secret word is ""taper"", then P would be correct. If not, then if P is in the word but wrong position, or absent.

But we are guessing to see.

We can also consider that in the first guess, we had no P, so if P were in the word, it would have been detected? No, because we didn't guess P in the first guess.

Similarly, second guess no P.

So we don't know about P.

Therefore, I'll go with ""taper"".

But let's see if there is a word that can test multiple letters at once? But we only have one position unknown, so we can't test multiple.

Unless we use a word that doesn't have the known letters in the correct positions? But that might be inefficient.

For example, we could guess a word that has the third letter and also tests other positions, but we already know four positions are fixed. So it's better to fix the known positions and only vary the unknown.

Therefore, I think ""taper"" is a good guess.

So the third guess is ""taper"".

But note: if the secret word is ""tater"", then by guessing ""taper"", we will get:

- T: ✓
- A: ✓
- P: x (if ""tater"" has T, not P)
- E: ✓
- R: ✓

But we would know that P is absent, and then we can try ""tater"" next.

Similarly, if it's ""tamer"", then P would be absent, and we try M next.

But we can also consider guessing ""tater"" directly to save a guess if it's correct.

But we don't know.

Since ""tater"" is a common word, and we have T, A, E, R, and duplicate T, it might be likely.

But let's see the feedback from the first guess: in ""crane"", we had E in position 5 marked as wrong. If the secret word is ""tater"", then E is in position 4, so in ""crane"", E in position 5 is wrong, which is consistent.

Similarly for ""taper"".

I think both are possible.

But to be safe, let's choose a word that doesn't duplicate letters first, so we test a new letter.

So I'll go with ""taper"".

<guess>taper</guess>### Analysis of Feedback and Reasoning for Next Guess

#### Step-by-Step Thought Process:
1. **Current Known Information from Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (""crane"")**:
     - C: Absent (x) → C is not in the secret word.
     - R: Present, wrong position (-) → R is in the word, but not in position 2.
     - A: Present, wrong position (-) → A is in the word, but not in position 3.
     - N: Absent (x) → N is not in the word.
     - E: Present, wrong position (-) → E is in the word, but not in position 5.
   - **Guess 2 (""tares"")**:
     - T: Correct position (✓) → T is in position 1.
     - A: Correct position (✓) → A is in position 2.
     - R: Present, wrong position (-) → R is in the word, but not in position 3.
     - E: Correct position (✓) → E is in position 4.
     - S: Absent (x) → S is not in the word.
   - **Inferences**:
     - The secret word starts with **T**, followed by **A** in position 2, and **E** in position 4 (i.e., the word pattern is `T A _ E _`).
     - **R must be in position 5**: 
       - R is confirmed present but cannot be in position 2 (from Guess 1) or position 3 (from Guess 2). Positions 1, 2, and 4 are occupied by T, A, and E, so R must be in position 5. Thus, the word pattern is now `T A _ E R`.
     - **Absent letters**: C, N, and S are eliminated.
     - **Position 3 constraints**:
       - Cannot be A (A is fixed in position 2, and Guess 1 ruled out position 3 for A).
       - Cannot be R (ruled out for position 3 by Guess 2).
       - Cannot be C, N, or S (absent letters).
       - Could be a duplicate of T or E (if the word has repeats), or a new letter not yet tested.

2. **Possible Words**:
   - The secret word must match `T A _ E R`. Common English words fitting this pattern include:
     - **TAPER** (e.g., to narrow or a candle): Uses P, a new letter.
     - **TAMER** (e.g., one who tames): Uses M, a new letter.
     - **TAKER** (e.g., one who takes): Uses K, a new letter.
     - **TATER** (e.g., informal for potato): Uses a duplicate T (position 3).
     - Less common options like **TABER** or **TAXER** are also possible but lower frequency.
   - **Key Insight**: The third letter is the only unknown. We need to test it efficiently.

3. **Strategy for Guess 3**:
   - **Goal**: Test the third position with a high-likelihood word that either solves the puzzle or provides new information.
   - **Why not guess a word with duplicates (like ""tater"") yet?** 
     - If ""tater"" is incorrect, we learn nothing new about other letters (e.g., P, M, K). Guessing a word with a new letter (e.g., P in ""taper"") tests for both the presence of that letter and its position.
   - **Why ""taper""?** 
     - It uses **P**, a common letter not yet tested (maximizes information gain).
     - If correct, we solve the puzzle. If incorrect, we learn whether P is present/absent, narrowing the list of possible words (e.g., if P is absent, ""tamer"" or ""taker"" become top candidates).
     - It fits the pattern `T A _ E R` with P in position 3, avoiding ruled-out positions/letters.
   - **Efficiency**: With 4 guesses remaining, this approach balances solving potential with information gain. If ""taper"" is wrong, feedback on P will quickly eliminate options.

4. **Final Decision**: 
   - Guess **""taper""** to test P in position 3. If feedback shows P is correct, the word is solved. If P is absent, we pivot to other candidates like ""tamer"" or ""tater"" next.

<guess>taper</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: tares -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) A(✓) R(-) E(✓) S(x)
Guess 3: taper -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) A(✓) P(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from Guess 3: ""taper""
- T: ✓ (correct in position 1)
- A: ✓ (correct in position 2)
- P: x (absent from the word)
- E: ✓ (correct in position 4)
- R: ✓ (correct in position 5)

Given this, we know:
- The secret word is T A _ E R (positions 1,2,4,5 confirmed as T,A,E,R).
- P is not in the word (newly eliminated letter).
- The third letter is still unknown.

From previous feedback, we also know:
- C, N, S, P are absent.
- R, A, E have been placed correctly in positions 5, 2, 4 respectively.

Possible candidates for the third letter:
- It must be a letter that forms a valid English word with ""T A _ E R"".
- It cannot be C, N, S, P (absent).
- It cannot be A or R (due to position constraints: A is fixed at position 2 and cannot be duplicated in position 3 based on earlier feedback; R is fixed at position 5 and feedback ruled out position 3 for R).

Common words fitting the pattern:
- **TAMER** (M in position 3)
- **TAKER** (K in position 3)
- **TATER** (T in position 3, duplicate) - note ""tater"" is informal for potato
- **TABER** (B in position 3) - less common
- **TAXER** (X in position 3)

However, we must consider the possibility of a duplicate T. In Guess 3 (""taper""):
- We guessed P (absent) and had T in position 1, which is correct. 
- If the secret word has T in position 3 (like in ""tater""), the feedback does not indicate duplicate T because we only guessed T once (in position 1). So ""tater"" is still plausible.

But we also have earlier feedback to consider:
- Guess 1 (""crane"") had no T, so no issue.
- Guess 2 (""tares"") had T in position 1 (correct) and no other T guessed.

Now, we have four possible common words: ""tamer"", ""taker"", ""tater"", ""taxer"".

Strategy:
- We need to test the third position efficiently.
- Since we have limited guesses, pick a word that tests multiple possibilities or a high-frequency letter.

Option 1: Guess ""tater"" to test for duplicate T. If correct, solved. If incorrect, we know T is not duplicated, so the third letter must be new (like M, K, X).

Option 2: Guess a word with M or K to isolate candidates. For instance, ""tamer"" tests M.

However, to preserve guesses, we can guess ""tater"" because it's common and resolves the duplicate question immediately.

After ""tater"":
- If incorrect, feedback will show position 3 as ✓ if T is correct? But wait, ""tater"" has T in position 3. If the word is ""tater"", we get all correct. If not, then:
  - T is not in position 3 (but may be present elsewhere? We know T is fixed at position 1), but specifically, the third letter is not T.
  - Since P is absent and T would be tested in position 3 (and if wrong, we know no duplicate T in position 3), then we can try other letters.

But perhaps better to test a new letter first? Since if ""tater"" is wrong, we still know only that T isn't duplicated in position 3. We don't learn about other letters.

If we guess ""tamer"":
- If correct, solved.
- If incorrect, then M is absent (x) or possibly misplaced? But the word pattern is fixed except position 3. If ""tamer"" is wrong, then:
  - Feedback: T(✓), A(✓), M(?), E(✓), R(✓). The ? tells us if M is present or absent.
  - If M is absent, we eliminate M and can focus on other letters like K or X.

Similarly, guessing ""taker"" tests K.

Given that ""tater"" is a simple and common word, I'll prioritize that.

So next guess: ""tater""

<guess>tater</guess>
After analyzing the feedback:
- **Pattern confirmed**: Positions 1 (T), 2 (A), 4 (E), and 5 (R) are fixed. Only position 3 is unknown.
- **Absent letters**: C, N, S, P (per previous feedback).
- **Guess 3 (""taper"")** ruled out P and confirmed all other letters except position 3.

**Possible words for `T A _ E R`**:
- **TAMER** (M in position 3)
- **TAKER** (K in position 3)
- **TATER** (T in position 3, duplicate)
- Other rare options like **TABER** or **TAXER**.

**Reasoning for ""tater""**:
- **High probability**: ""Tater"" is a common informal word for potato. Testing for a duplicate T in position 3 is efficient because:
  - If correct (✓), the puzzle is solved.
  - If incorrect (e.g., third letter is not T), we:
    - Learn T is not duplicated (or not in position 3, specifically).
    - Eliminate ""tater"" to focus on less common options like ""tamer"" or ""taker"".
- **Efficiency**: With 3 guesses remaining, solving faster is ideal. Testing a duplicate letter resolves ambiguity early.

This guess maximizes the chance of solving immediately while minimizing risk.After reviewing the feedback from Guess 3 (""taper""):
- **T(✓)**, **A(✓)**, **E(✓)**, **R(✓)**: These confirm positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 are **T**, **A**, **E**, and **R**, respectively.  
- **P(x)**: P is **absent** from the secret word (newly eliminated).  
- The secret word pattern is **T A _ E R**, with only position 3 unknown.  

### Key Constraints:
1. **Eliminated letters**: C, N, S (from prior feedback), and P (newly eliminated).  
2. **Position 3 cannot be**:  
   - A (fixed in position 2, and Guess 1 ruled out position 3 for A).  
   - R (fixed in position 5, and Guess 2 ruled out position 3 for R).  
3. **Possible candidates** for position 3:  
   - **T** (duplicate, e.g., ""tater"" = potato).  
   - **M** (e.g., ""tamer"" = one who tames).  
   - **K** (e.g., ""taker"" = one who takes).  
   - Less common options like **B** (""taber"") or **X** (""taxer"").  

### Reasoning for Next Guess:
- **Why ""tater""?**  
  - It tests **T** in position 3—a likely duplicate letter given frequency.  
  - If correct, the puzzle is solved.  
  - If incorrect, we:  
    - Confirm T is **not duplicated** (narrowing to options like ""tamer""/""taker"").  
    - Preserve common letters (M/K) for future guesses.  
- **Efficiency**: With 3 guesses left, prioritizing ""tater"" resolves the duplicate-T question immediately. Testing less common letters first (e.g., M/K) risks wasting a guess if T is the solution.

We are free to test.\n\n However, we are trying to maximize information.\n\n Another candidate: ""ARISE"" - but E is at 5 again? So avoid.\n\n How about ""RAISE"" but E at 5? Avoid.\n\n How about ""SERAI"" (an inn) but that might be too obscure.\n\n Let me stick with ""TARES"".\n\n But wait, what about ""REACT""? But we know C is not in the word, so we cannot use C.\n\n So ""TARES"" is valid.\n\n Alternatively, ""PARSE"": \n  P at 1 -> new\n  A at 2 -> new for A (allowed)\n  R at 3 -> new for R (allowed)\n  S at 4 -> new\n  E at 5 -> but we know E is not at 5?

Since we now know that position 3 is not R, and we also know from the first guess that position 2 is not R, and positions 1, 2, and 4 are fixed as T, A, E, then indeed R must be in position 5.\n\nAdditionally, we know that S is not in the word.\n\nAlso, from the first guess, we know that C and N are not in the word.\n\nSo, the secret word so far is: T A _ E _\n\nAnd we know the fifth letter must be R? But wait, we have to confirm: the feedback for the second guess shows that R is present but not in position 3, and we have fixed positions 1,2,4. The only unknown position is 3 and 5. But position 5 is available. However, we must consider that the word might have more than one R? But the feedback doesn\'t indicate that. But it\'s possible. However, the feedback for ""crane"" had R in position 2 and it was marked as present (but wrong position). In ""tares"", R is in position 3 and marked as present (wrong position). So if R were in position 5, then in ""tares"", the R in position 3 would be an extra R? But the secret word might have only one R. However, we don\'t know for sure.\n\nBut let\'s think: if the secret word has R only in position 5, then in ""tares"", the R in position 3 would be an incorrect position (which it is, as per feedback) and the R in position 5 would be correct? But in ""tares"", we don\'t have a letter in position 5? ""tares"" is T-A-R-E-S, so position 5 is S. We don\'t have a letter in position 5 for R. So the feedback for R is only about the R in position 3. Therefore, the secret word has an R, but it\'s not in position 3. And we know it\'s not in position 2. And positions 1,2,4 are fixed as T,A,E. So the only position left is 5. Therefore, the fifth letter must be R.\n\nBut what about the third letter? We don\'t know it yet.\n\nSo the word is: T A ? E R\n\nBut wait, that would be five letters: position1: T, position2: A, position3: ?, position4: E, position5: R.\n\nNow, we need to find the third letter.\n\nWe also know from the first guess that the word contains R, A, E (which we have) and we know C and N are not in the word. Also, S is not in the word (from second guess).\n\nIn the first guess, we had ""crane"" and we know that the secret word has R, A, E. Now we have T, A, E, R, and one missing letter in position 3.\n\nWhat letters are possible for position 3?\n\nWe know the secret word does not contain: C, N, S (and also the letters that were not present in the feedback, but we don\'t have a full list).\n\nFrom the two guesses, we have used: C, R, A, N, E, T, S.\n\nWe know C, N, S are absent.\n\nThe letter in position 3 must be a letter that is not C, N, S, and also not T, A, E, R? But T, A, E, R are already in the word, but they can be repeated? However, we don\'t have any indication of repeated letters so far.\n\nBut let\'s check: in the first guess, we had no repeated letters, and in the second guess, we had T, A, R, E, S (all distinct). The secret word: we have T, A, E, R and one more. If the secret word has no repeated letters, then the third letter must be a new letter that we haven\'t tried.\n\nBut we don\'t know if there are repeated letters. However, since we have no feedback indicating a repeated letter (for example, if a letter is repeated and one is correct and the other is not, it might show multiple marks), but in this case, we don\'t have that.\n\nBut to be safe, we should consider that the third letter could be a letter we haven\'t tried, or it could be one of the existing letters? But we have T, A, E, R already. If the third letter is one of these, then it would be a duplicate.\n\nFor example, if the third letter is T, then the word would be T A T E R. But that might be a valid word? ""tater"" (a potato). Similarly, if it\'s A, then ""taaer"" is not a word. If it\'s E, ""taeer"" not a word. If it\'s R, then ""tarer"" (one who tares) is a word? But let\'s see.\n\nBut we have to consider the feedback from the first guess. In ""crane"", we had A in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. But if the secret word has A in position 2 (which is fixed) and also in position 3? Then in ""crane"", the A in position 3 would be correct? But it was marked as wrong position. So that means the secret word does not have A in position 3, but it does have an A. Since we now know A is in position 2, then if there were a second A, it could be in position 3? But the feedback for ""crane"" would have marked the A as correct if it were in position 3? But it was marked as wrong position, meaning that the A is in the word but not in position 3. That doesn\'t preclude a second A? Actually, if there were two A\'s, and one is in position 2 (which we now know) and one in position 3, then in ""crane"", the A in position 3 would be correct and should be marked as correct (✓), but it was marked as wrong position (-). Therefore, the secret word does not have an A in position 3. So if the secret word has only one A, then we know that. Similarly, for other letters.\n\nBut in our case, for the third position, if we put A, it would be incorrect because we know A is in position 2 and the feedback from ""crane"" showed that position 3 is not A. Similarly, for T: in the first guess, we didn\'t have T. In the second guess, T is in position 1 and correct. If we put T in position 3, then the word would have two T\'s? But in the second guess, we only had one T and it was in position 1. The feedback didn\'t show any other T? The feedback for ""tares"" had T as correct in position 1, and the other letters: A correct, R wrong, E correct, S absent. There was no indication of another T? But if the secret word had a T in position 3, then in ""tares"", we only have one T (in position 1) and the secret word has two T\'s, so the feedback wouldn\'t show the second T because we didn\'t guess it. So it\'s possible.\n\nSimilarly for E: we have E in position 4. If we put E in position 3, then the word would be T A E E R. But in the first guess, we had E in position 5 and it was marked as wrong position. If the secret word has E in position 4 and also in position 3, then in ""crane"", the E in position 5 would be one of the E\'s? But the feedback marked it as wrong position, meaning that the E is in the word but not in position 5. It doesn\'t say anything about position 3. However, in the second guess, we have E in position 4 and it\'s correct. So if we put E in position 3, then the secret word has two E\'s. But we don\'t have feedback that rules that out.\n\nSimilarly for R: we think R is in position 5. If we put R in position 3, then the word would be T A R E R. But in the first guess, we had R in position 2 and it was marked as wrong position. If the secret word has R in position 3 and 5, then in ""crane"", the R in position 2 would be wrong, which is consistent. In ""tares"", we have R in position 3 and it was marked as wrong position? But if the secret word has R in position 3, then in ""tares"", the R in position 3 should be correct (✓), but it was marked as wrong position (-). Therefore, the secret word does not have R in position 3. So R cannot be in position 3.\n\nTherefore, for position 3, we cannot have R (because of the feedback from ""tares"": R in position 3 is wrong). We cannot have A (because of feedback from ""crane"": A in position 3 is wrong). We cannot have T? We don\'t have direct feedback, but if we put T in position 3, it would be a duplicate. Similarly for E.\n\nBut duplicates are allowed? The word could have duplicate letters.\n\nHowever, we have to consider the feedback.\n\nLet me summarize the constraints for position 3:\n\n- It cannot be C, N, S (absent letters).\n- It cannot be A (because in ""crane"", A in position 3 was marked as wrong, and we now know A is in position 2, so if there were a second A, the feedback in ""crane"" would have shown it as correct? But wait, no: if there is a second A, and we guessed A in position 3, and the secret word has A in position 2 and 3, then the A in position 3 would be correct and should be marked as correct (✓). But in ""crane"", it was marked as wrong position (-). Therefore, the secret word does not have an A in position 3. So even if there is a second A, it cannot be in position 3. But we don\'t know if there is a second A. However, for position 3, we cannot put A because it would be incorrect (as per feedback).\n\nSimilarly, we cannot put R in position 3 because in ""tares"", R in position 3 was marked as wrong, meaning the secret word does not have R in position 3.\n\nFor T: we don\'t have any feedback that says T cannot be in position 3. Similarly for E.\n\nBut we also have to consider that the secret word might not have duplicate letters.\n\nGiven that, it might be more efficient to assume no duplicates for now and try a new letter.\n\nBut we have to consider all possibilities.\n\nHowever, we have only 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We have 3 more after this? Actually, we have used 2, so we have 4 left? But we need to solve it.\n\nThe word is T A ? E R, and we need to find the missing letter.\n\nPossible letters: any letter except C, N, S, and also excluding A and R for position 3 (as explained). But T and E are possible if duplicated.\n\nBut let\'s list possible words.\n\nCommon words that fit T A _ E R:\n\n- TAPER (a candle or to narrow)\n- TAMER (one who tames)\n- TASER (a stun gun) but S is absent, so not possible.\n- TAXER (one who taxes)\n- TABER (a type of dance? not common)\n- TAGER? not a word.\n- TALER? a coin, but not common.\n- TARER? but R is in position 5, and if we put R in position 3, we cannot because of feedback.\n\nBut we cannot have R in position 3.\n\nSimilarly, TATER (potato) - T A T E R, which has T in position 1 and 3.\n\nIs that possible? Let\'s check against feedback.\n\nFirst guess ""crane"": no T, so no issue.\n\nSecond guess ""tares"": we have T in position 1 (correct), A in 2 (correct), R in 3 (wrong), E in 4 (correct), S in 5 (absent). If the secret word is ""tater"", then:\n\n- T in position 1: correct (matches)\n- A in position 2: correct (matches)\n- R in position 3: in ""tares"" we guessed R in 3, but in ""tater"" position 3 is T, not R. So R is not in position 3, which is consistent with the feedback (wrong position). But the secret word ""tater"" has R in position 5. In ""tares"", we did not guess any R in position 5? We guessed S in position 5. So the feedback for R: we have one R in the guess (position 3) and the secret word has one R (position 5). Since the positions are different, it should be marked as present but wrong position, which it was. Also, S is absent, which is correct.\n\nSo ""tater"" is a possible word.\n\nAnother possibility: ""taper"" - T A P E R.\n\nCheck against feedback:\n\nFirst guess: no P, so no issue.\n\nSecond guess: ""tares"" vs ""taper"": \n- T: correct\n- A: correct\n- R: in ""tares"" we have R in 3, but in ""taper"" position 3 is P, not R. The R is in position 5. So the R in the guess (position 3) is not in the secret word at position 3, and the secret word has R in position 5. So the feedback should be R present but wrong position, which matches. S is absent, correct.\n\nSimilarly, ""tamer"": T A M E R.\n\nSame logic: M is new, R in position 5.\n\nNow, what about ""taxer"": T A X E R.\n\nX is a letter.\n\nBut we need to see if it\'s valid.\n\nAlso, are there words with E in position 3? Like ""taeer"" is not a word. ""Taker"" would be T A K E R, but K is a letter.\n\n""Taker"" is a word.\n\nBut let\'s list all possible common words:\n\n- taper\n- tamer\n- taker\n- taxer\n- taber (less common)\n- taler (less common)\n- tater\n\nBut we need to figure out which one.\n\nWe have to make a guess that can distinguish these.\n\nBut we have only one letter missing, so we can try to guess one of these.\n\nHowever, we have 4 more guesses, so we can try a word that includes several of the possible letters.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know the third letter, and we have multiple options.\n\nWe can use a guess that tests multiple possibilities.\n\nBut since we know the first, second, fourth, and fifth letters, and only the third is missing, we can try to guess one of the common ones.\n\nBut we have to be careful: if we guess wrong, we use a try.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that has a new letter in position 3 and also includes other letters to test, but we already know four letters.\n\nBut we don\'t have to use the known letters? We can, but we can also use a word that has the known letters in the correct positions and a new letter in position 3.\n\nBut we don\'t have many letters left to test? We have used: C, R, A, N, E, T, S.\n\nAbsent: C, N, S.\n\nPresent: T, A, E, R, and one more.\n\nThe remaining letters are almost the entire alphabet minus a few.\n\nBut we can try a word that has T, A, E, R in the correct positions and a new letter in position 3.\n\nBut that\'s exactly what we are going to do: guess a word like ""taper"" or ""tamer"", etc.\n\nBut we need to choose one.\n\nTo maximize information, we might choose a word that has a common letter that appears in many possible words? But all are different.\n\nSince we are not sure, we can choose a word that uses a letter we haven\'t tried, so that if it\'s wrong, we get information about that letter.\n\nFor example, if we guess ""taper"", and it\'s wrong, then we know P is not in the word, and then we can try another.\n\nSimilarly for ""tamer"", we test M.\n\nBut we have to start somewhere.\n\nLet\'s see the frequency of letters. Common letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... but we have used E, T, A, R. N and S are out. So O, I, L, U, D, etc.\n\nIn the possible words:\n\n- taper: P\n- tamer: M\n- taker: K\n- taxer: X\n- taber: B\n- taler: L\n- tater: T (duplicate)\n\nT is already in the word, so ""tater"" has a duplicate T.\n\nWe can try ""tater"" first because it uses a letter we already know is present (T), so if it\'s wrong, we know that the third letter is not T, and then we can try others.\n\nBut we know T is in position 1, but it might be duplicated.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t duplicate, to test a new letter.\n\nI think it\'s better to test a new letter.\n\nLet me choose ""taper"" because P is a common letter.\n\nSo guess: ""taper""\n\nBut let\'s confirm the feedback we would get if the word is ""taper"":\n\n- T: correct (position 1)\n- A: correct (position 2)\n- P: new letter, if it is in the word, but in ""taper"" we have P in position 3. If the secret word is ""taper"", then P would be correct. If not, then if P is in the word but wrong position, or absent.\n\nBut we are guessing to see.\n\nWe can also consider that in the first guess, we had no P, so if P were in the word, it would have been detected? No, because we didn\'t guess P in the first guess.\n\nSimilarly, second guess no P.\n\nSo we don\'t know about P.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""taper"".\n\nBut let\'s see if there is a word that can test multiple letters at once? But we only have one position unknown, so we can\'t test multiple.\n\nUnless we use a word that doesn\'t have the known letters in the correct positions? But that might be inefficient.\n\nFor example, we could guess a word that has the third letter and also tests other positions, but we already know four positions are fixed. So it\'s better to fix the known positions and only vary the unknown.\n\nTherefore, I think ""taper"" is a good guess.\n\nSo the third guess is ""taper"".\n\nBut note: if the secret word is ""tater"", then by guessing ""taper"", we will get:\n\n- T: ✓\n- A: ✓\n- P: x (if ""tater"" has T, not P)\n- E: ✓\n- R: ✓\n\nBut we would know that P is absent, and then we can try ""tater"" next.\n\nSimilarly, if it\'s ""tamer"", then P would be absent, and we try M next.\n\nBut we can also consider guessing ""tater"" directly to save a guess if it\'s correct.\n\nBut we don\'t know.\n\nSince ""tater"" is a common word, and we have T, A, E, R, and duplicate T, it might be likely.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback from the first guess: in ""crane"", we had E in position 5 marked as wrong. If the secret word is ""tater"", then E is in position 4, so in ""crane"", E in position 5 is wrong, which is consistent.\n\nSimilarly for ""taper"".\n\nI think both are possible.\n\nBut to be safe, let\'s choose a word that doesn\'t duplicate letters first, so we test a new letter.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""taper"".\n\n<guess>taper</guess>### Analysis of Feedback and Reasoning for Next Guess\n\n#### Step-by-Step Thought Process:\n1. **Current Known Information from Feedback**:\n   - **Guess 1 (""crane"")**:\n     - C: Absent (x) → C is not in the secret word.\n     - R: Present, wrong position (-) → R is in the word, but not in position 2.\n     - A: Present, wrong position (-) → A is in the word, but not in position 3.\n     - N: Absent (x) → N is not in the word.\n     - E: Present, wrong position (-) → E is in the word, but not in position 5.\n   - **Guess 2 (""tares"")**:\n     - T: Correct position (✓) → T is in position 1.\n     - A: Correct position (✓) → A is in position 2.\n     - R: Present, wrong position (-) → R is in the word, but not in position 3.\n     - E: Correct position (✓) → E is in position 4.\n     - S: Absent (x) → S is not in the word.\n   - **Inferences**:\n     - The secret word starts with **T**, followed by **A** in position 2, and **E** in position 4 (i.e., the word pattern is `T A _ E _`).\n     - **R must be in position 5**: \n       - R is confirmed present but cannot be in position 2 (from Guess 1) or position 3 (from Guess 2). Positions 1, 2, and 4 are occupied by T, A, and E, so R must be in position 5. Thus, the word pattern is now `T A _ E R`.\n     - **Absent letters**: C, N, and S are eliminated.\n     - **Position 3 constraints**:\n       - Cannot be A (A is fixed in position 2, and Guess 1 ruled out position 3 for A).\n       - Cannot be R (ruled out for position 3 by Guess 2).\n       - Cannot be C, N, or S (absent letters).\n       - Could be a duplicate of T or E (if the word has repeats), or a new letter not yet tested.\n\n2. **Possible Words**:\n   - The secret word must match `T A _ E R`. Common English words fitting this pattern include:\n     - **TAPER** (e.g., to narrow or a candle): Uses P, a new letter.\n     - **TAMER** (e.g., one who tames): Uses M, a new letter.\n     - **TAKER** (e.g., one who takes): Uses K, a new letter.\n     - **TATER** (e.g., informal for potato): Uses a duplicate T (position 3).\n     - Less common options like **TABER** or **TAXER** are also possible but lower frequency.\n   - **Key Insight**: The third letter is the only unknown. We need to test it efficiently.\n\n3. **Strategy for Guess 3**:\n   - **Goal**: Test the third position with a high-likelihood word that either solves the puzzle or provides new information.\n   - **Why not guess a word with duplicates (like ""tater"") yet?** \n     - If ""tater"" is incorrect, we learn nothing new about other letters (e.g., P, M, K). Guessing a word with a new letter (e.g., P in ""taper"") tests for both the presence of that letter and its position.\n   - **Why ""taper""?** \n     - It uses **P**, a common letter not yet tested (maximizes information gain).\n     - If correct, we solve the puzzle. If incorrect, we learn whether P is present/absent, narrowing the list of possible words (e.g., if P is absent, ""tamer"" or ""taker"" become top candidates).\n     - It fits the pattern `T A _ E R` with P in position 3, avoiding ruled-out positions/letters.\n   - **Efficiency**: With 4 guesses remaining, this approach balances solving potential with information gain. If ""taper"" is wrong, feedback on P will quickly eliminate options.\n\n4. **Final Decision**: \n   - Guess **""taper""** to test P in position 3. If feedback shows P is correct, the word is solved. If P is absent, we pivot to other candidates like ""tamer"" or ""tater"" next.\n\n<guess>taper</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tares -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) A(✓) R(-) E(✓) S(x)\nGuess 3: taper -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) A(✓) P(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from Guess 3: ""taper""\n- T: ✓ (correct in position 1)\n- A: ✓ (correct in position 2)\n- P: x (absent from the word)\n- E: ✓ (correct in position 4)\n- R: ✓ (correct in position 5)\n\nGiven this, we know:\n- The secret word is T A _ E R (positions 1,2,4,5 confirmed as T,A,E,R).\n- P is not in the word (newly eliminated letter).\n- The third letter is still unknown.\n\nFrom previous feedback, we also know:\n- C, N, S, P are absent.\n- R, A, E have been placed correctly in positions 5, 2, 4 respectively.\n\nPossible candidates for the third letter:\n- It must be a letter that forms a valid English word with ""T A _ E R"".\n- It cannot be C, N, S, P (absent).\n- It cannot be A or R (due to position constraints: A is fixed at position 2 and cannot be duplicated in position 3 based on earlier feedback; R is fixed at position 5 and feedback ruled out position 3 for R).\n\nCommon words fitting the pattern:\n- **TAMER** (M in position 3)\n- **TAKER** (K in position 3)\n- **TATER** (T in position 3, duplicate) - note ""tater"" is informal for potato\n- **TABER** (B in position 3) - less common\n- **TAXER** (X in position 3)\n\nHowever, we must consider the possibility of a duplicate T. In Guess 3 (""taper""):\n- We guessed P (absent) and had T in position 1, which is correct. \n- If the secret word has T in position 3 (like in ""tater""), the feedback does not indicate duplicate T because we only guessed T once (in position 1). So ""tater"" is still plausible.\n\nBut we also have earlier feedback to consider:\n- Guess 1 (""crane"") had no T, so no issue.\n- Guess 2 (""tares"") had T in position 1 (correct) and no other T guessed.\n\nNow, we have four possible common words: ""tamer"", ""taker"", ""tater"", ""taxer"".\n\nStrategy:\n- We need to test the third position efficiently.\n- Since we have limited guesses, pick a word that tests multiple possibilities or a high-frequency letter.\n\nOption 1: Guess ""tater"" to test for duplicate T. If correct, solved. If incorrect, we know T is not duplicated, so the third letter must be new (like M, K, X).\n\nOption 2: Guess a word with M or K to isolate candidates. For instance, ""tamer"" tests M.\n\nHowever, to preserve guesses, we can guess ""tater"" because it\'s common and resolves the duplicate question immediately.\n\nAfter ""tater"":\n- If incorrect, feedback will show position 3 as ✓ if T is correct? But wait, ""tater"" has T in position 3. If the word is ""tater"", we get all correct. If not, then:\n  - T is not in position 3 (but may be present elsewhere? We know T is fixed at position 1), but specifically, the third letter is not T.\n  - Since P is absent and T would be tested in position 3 (and if wrong, we know no duplicate T in position 3), then we can try other letters.\n\nBut perhaps better to test a new letter first? Since if ""tater"" is wrong, we still know only that T isn\'t duplicated in position 3. We don\'t learn about other letters.\n\nIf we guess ""tamer"":\n- If correct, solved.\n- If incorrect, then M is absent (x) or possibly misplaced? But the word pattern is fixed except position 3. If ""tamer"" is wrong, then:\n  - Feedback: T(✓), A(✓), M(?), E(✓), R(✓). The ? tells us if M is present or absent.\n  - If M is absent, we eliminate M and can focus on other letters like K or X.\n\nSimilarly, guessing ""taker"" tests K.\n\nGiven that ""tater"" is a simple and common word, I\'ll prioritize that.\n\nSo next guess: ""tater""\n\n<guess>tater</guess>\nAfter analyzing the feedback:\n- **Pattern confirmed**: Positions 1 (T), 2 (A), 4 (E), and 5 (R) are fixed. Only position 3 is unknown.\n- **Absent letters**: C, N, S, P (per previous feedback).\n- **Guess 3 (""taper"")** ruled out P and confirmed all other letters except position 3.\n\n**Possible words for `T A _ E R`**:\n- **TAMER** (M in position 3)\n- **TAKER** (K in position 3)\n- **TATER** (T in position 3, duplicate)\n- Other rare options like **TABER** or **TAXER**.\n\n**Reasoning for ""tater""**:\n- **High probability**: ""Tater"" is a common informal word for potato.

We have the feedback from Guess 4: ""tater""
- T: ✓ (correct in position 1)
- A: ✓ (correct in position 2)
- T: - (in the word but wrong position) — note: this is the second T, in position 3
- E: ✓ (correct in position 4)
- R: ✓ (correct in position 5)

This feedback is interesting because it shows that the third letter T is present but not in position 3. However, we already have T in position 1. So the secret word has at least two T's.

But the feedback says the T in position 3 is present but wrong position. That means the secret word has another T, but not in position 3.

But we already have T in position 1. So the secret word must have a T in a position other than 1 and 3? But position 1 is fixed as T, so the duplicate T must be in a different position. However, the only positions are 1,2,3,4,5.

Position 2 is A, position 4 is E, position 5 is R. So none of these are T. Therefore, the only possibility is that the secret word has a T in position 1 and another T in a position that is not 3? But we don't have any other position available? This seems contradictory.

Let me reexamine:

The secret word is T A ? E R.

We guessed ""tater"", which is T A T E R.

Feedback:
- First T (position 1): correct (✓)
- A (position 2): correct (✓)
- Second T (position 3): present but wrong position (-)
- E (position 4): correct (✓)
- R (position 5): correct (✓)

The feedback for the second T (position 3) is marked as present but wrong position. This means that the secret word has a T that is not in position 3. But we already have a T in position 1. So the secret word must have at least two T's: one in position 1 and one in another position. However, the other positions are 2,4,5, which are fixed as A, E, R. So they cannot be T. Therefore, it's impossible for the secret word to have a T in any other position? This is a contradiction.

Unless the secret word has more than two T's? But that would require a third T, which still has no place.

Perhaps the feedback is indicating that the T in position 3 is not in the word? But it's marked as present, meaning there is a T somewhere else? But we already accounted for position 1.

I think there might be a misunderstanding of the feedback.

The feedback for ""tater"" is: T(✓) A(✓) T(-) E(✓) R(✓)

This means:
- The first T (position 1) is correct and in the right place.
- The A (position 2) is correct.
- The second T (position 3) is in the word but not in position 3.
- E (position 4) is correct.
- R (position 5) is correct.

So the secret word has at least two T's: one in position 1 and one in another position. But the other positions are 2,3,4,5. We know position 2 is A, position 4 is E, position 5 is R, so they are not T. Therefore, the only possibility is that the secret word has a T in position 3? But the feedback says the T in position 3 is not in the correct position? That would be contradictory.

Unless the secret word has three T's? But then we would need a T in position 3 as well? But the feedback says the T in position 3 is not correct, meaning it's not in position 3? But if the secret word has a T in position 3, then it should be marked as correct.

This is confusing.

Perhaps the feedback system marks only one instance if there are duplicates? But in Wordle, if there are duplicate letters, it can mark multiple.

Standard Wordle rules: if you guess a letter that appears more times in the guess than in the secret, and one of them is in the correct position, then the extra one might be marked as absent. But in this case, the first T is correct, so the second T might be marked as absent if there is no second T? But here it's marked as present but wrong position.

The feedback for the second T is ""-"", which means it is in the word but not in that position. So there must be a second T in the secret word.

But where can it be? The only positions are 1,2,3,4,5. Position 1 is T, position 2 is A, position 4 is E, position 5 is R. So position 3 must be the only place for the second T? But the feedback says it's not in position 3? That's impossible.

Unless the secret word is not T A ? E R? But we have confirmed T in 1, A in 2, E in 4, R in 5 from previous guesses.

In guess 2: ""tares"" had T(✓) A(✓) E(✓) and R(-) S(x). And we deduced R must be in position 5.

In guess 3: ""taper"" had T(✓) A(✓) E(✓) R(✓) and P(x), which confirmed R in position 5.

So the pattern is fixed: T A ? E R.

The only unknown is position 3.

Now, when we guess ""tater"", which has T in position 3, the feedback says that T is present but not in position 3. But if the secret word has a T in position 3, it should be marked as correct. If it doesn't, and there is no second T, it should be marked as absent. But it's marked as present, so there is a second T, but not in position 3. But there is no other position for it.

This implies that our assumption that the secret word is T A ? E R is incorrect? But how? The feedback from previous guesses strongly supports it.

Let me double-check guess 2: ""tares"" -> T(✓) A(✓) R(-) E(✓) S(x)

This means:
- T in position 1 is correct.
- A in position 2 is correct.
- R is in the word but not in position 3.
- E in position 4 is correct.
- S is not in the word.

From this, we deduced that R must be in position 5 because positions 1,2,4 are taken, and position 3 is not available for R. But is that correct? The secret word has five positions. We know position 1: T, position 2: A, position 4: E, and R is in the word but not in position 3. So R must be in position 5. That seems solid.

Similarly, in guess 3: ""taper"" -> T(✓) A(✓) P(x) E(✓) R(✓) — this confirms R in position 5.

So the only unknown is position 3.

But then the feedback for ""tater"" doesn't make sense.

Unless the secret word has a letter in position 3 that is T, but the feedback is marking it as wrong because of the duplicate? But in Wordle, if the secret word has two T's and you guess two T's, one in the correct position and one in the wrong position, then the one in the correct position is marked green, and the one in the wrong position is marked yellow.

But in this case, for ""tater"", if the secret word is ""tater"", then position 3 should be green for T. But it's marked as yellow, which means it's not in position 3. So the secret word is not ""tater"".

But then what is it? It must have a T in a different position? But there is no different position.

Perhaps the secret word has T in position 1 and position 3, but the feedback for the second T is yellow because it's not in the correct position? But if it is in position 3 and the secret word has T in position 3, it should be green.

I think there's a mistake in the feedback interpretation.

Let me read the feedback again: Guess 4: tater -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) A(✓) T(-) E(✓) R(✓)

This means the first T is green, the second T is yellow.

For the second T to be yellow, the secret word must have a T that is not in position 3, and not in position 1 (because that T is already accounted for by the green T). So there must be a T in position 2,4, or 5. But position 2 is A, position 4 is E, position 5 is R, and they are fixed and not T. Contradiction.

Unless the fixed positions are not all correct? But they are marked green in multiple guesses.

In guess 2: T, A, E are green in positions 1,2,4.

In guess 3: T, A, E, R are green in positions 1,2,4,5.

In guess 4: T, A, E, R are green again, and the second T is yellow.

So positions 1,2,4,5 are fixed.

The only possibility is that the secret word has a T in one of the fixed positions? But they are occupied by other letters.

I think the only logical conclusion is that the secret word has a duplicate letter in position 3, but the letter is not T. But then why is the second T in ""tater"" marked as present? It must be that the secret word has a T in a position that is not 1,2,3,4,5? Impossible.

Perhaps the feedback for guess 4 is indicating that the second T is present, but it is not in position 3, and since position 1 is already T, it must be that the secret word has a T in a position that we haven't guessed? But we have guessed all positions.

I think there's a flaw in our earlier deduction that R is in position 5.

Let me revisit guess 2: ""tares""

- T in 1: green
- A in 2: green
- R in 3: yellow
- E in 4: green
- S in 5: absent

From this, we concluded that R must be in position 5 because it can't be in 3, and 1,2,4 are taken. But is it possible that R is in position 5? But in the guess, position 5 is S, which is absent, so position 5 is open. But the feedback for R is yellow, meaning R is in the word but not in position 3. It doesn't tell us where it is.

In guess 3: ""taper"" -> T(✓) A(✓) P(x) E(✓) R(✓)

Here, R is in position 5 and marked green. So that confirms R is in position 5.

So position 5 is R.

Unless the green R in position 5 in guess 3 is correct, so it is fixed.

But then in guess 4, we have R in position 5 green again.

So position 5 is R.

The only way out is that the secret word has more than one R? But in guess 2, we had R in position 3 yellow, and in guess 3, R in position 5 green. If the secret word has only one R, then in guess 2, the R in position 3 is yellow because the R is in position 5. In guess 3, R in position 5 is green.

In guess 4, ""tater"", we have R in position 5 green, and no other R. But we have two T's.

The feedback for the second T is yellow, so there is a second T in the secret word, but not in position 3. But where? The only possibility is that it is in position 2 or 4, but position 2 is A and position 4 is E, both fixed and green in multiple guesses.

This is impossible.

Perhaps the secret word is ""treat"" or something, but that doesn't match the fixed positions.

Let's list what we know for sure:

- Position 1: T (green in guess 2,3,4)
- Position 2: A (green in guess 2,3,4)
- Position 4: E (green in guess 2,3,4)
- Position 5: R (green in guess 3,4) — in guess 2, R was in position 3 and yellow, but position 5 was S which was absent, so position 5 must be R.

So the word is T A ? E R.

Now, for ""tater"" guess: the second T in position 3 is yellow. This means that in the secret word, there is a T that is not in position 3 and not in position 1 (because that T is already used for the green). So there must be a T in position 2,4, or 5. But position 2 is A, not T; position 4 is E, not T; position 5 is R, not T. Contradiction.

The only way this can be resolved is if the secret word has a letter in position 3 that is T, but the feedback is not marking it as green for some reason? But that doesn't make sense.

Perhaps the feedback for guess 4 is incorrect, but we have to work with it.

Another possibility: in Wordle, if you guess a letter that appears more times in the guess than in the secret, and one of them is in the correct position, the extras may be marked as absent if there are no more of that letter. But in this case, the second T is marked as present (yellow), so there must be a second T in the secret word.

But where? The only position left is 3, but it's marked as not in position 3.

I think there's a mistake in the initial setup.

Perhaps the secret word has T in position 1 and position 3, but the feedback for the second T is yellow because the first T is already green, and the second T is not needed? But that's not how it works. If the secret word has two T's, and you guess two T's, one in position 1 (green) and one in position 3, and if position 3 is also T, it should be green.

Unless the secret word has only one T, in position 1. Then the second T in position 3 should be marked as absent (grey). But it's marked as yellow, which means present but wrong position, so there must be a second T.

I'm stuck.

Let's ignore the deduction for a moment and list the feedback again.

Guess 1: crane
- C: x
- R: - (in word, not position 2)
- A: - (in word, not position 3)
- N: x
- E: - (in word, not position 5)

Guess 2: tares
- T: ✓ (position 1)
- A: ✓ (position 2)
- R: - (in word, not position 3)
- E: ✓ (position 4)
- S: x

Guess 3: taper
- T: ✓ (position 1)
- A: ✓ (position 2)
- P: x
- E: ✓ (position 4)
- R: ✓ (position 5)

Guess 4: tater
- T: ✓ (position 1)
- A: ✓ (position 2)
- T: - (in word, not position 3)  [second T]
- E: ✓ (position 4)
- R: ✓ (position 5)

From guess 2, we have R is in the word but not in position 3. From guess 3, R is in position 5 and correct.

From guess 4, the second T is in the word but not in position 3.

The secret word has: T in 1, A in 2, E in 4, R in 5, and an unknown in 3.

Additionally, it has another T somewhere. But where? The only position is 3, but it's not in 3, and the other positions are filled.

Unless the secret word is not 5 letters? But it is.

Perhaps the feedback for the second T in ""tater"" is for a T that is not in position 1 or 3, but in a different position, but there is no different position.

I think the only logical explanation is that the secret word has a T in position 3, but the feedback is yellow because the first T is already green, and the system is indicating that there is a T in the word but not in position 3 for the second T? But that doesn't make sense because if position 3 is T, it should be green.

Perhaps in the feedback, the first T is green, so the second T is not needed and is marked as grey if there is no second T, or yellow if there is a second T elsewhere. But in this case, if position 3 is T, it should be green.

I recall that in Wordle, for duplicate letters, if the secret word has two of a letter, and you guess two of that letter, with one in the correct position and the other in a wrong position, the one in the correct position is green, and the one in the wrong position is yellow. If both are in wrong positions, both yellow. If one is in correct position and the other in a wrong position, green and yellow.

But if the secret word has only one T, and you guess two T's, with one in the correct position, the other is grey.

In this case, for ""tater"", if the secret word has only one T (in position 1), then the second T should be grey. But it's yellow, so there must be a second T in the secret word.

But where can it be? The only position left is 3, so it must be in position 3. But then it should be green, not yellow.

This is a paradox.

Unless the secret word has a T in a position that is not 1,2,3,4,5? Impossible.

Perhaps the fixed positions are not all correct? But they are marked green in multiple guesses.

Another idea: in guess 2, when we had ""tares"", position 5 is S, which is absent, so position 5 is not S. In guess 3, we put R in position 5 and it was green, so position 5 is R.

But in guess 4, we have R in position 5 green, so it's fixed.

I think the only way is to consider that the secret word has a letter in position 3 that is not T, but the second T in ""tater"" is marked as yellow because there is a T in the word that is not yet identified, but we have position 1 T.

Perhaps the secret word has T in position 1 and also in position 3, but the feedback system has a bug or we are misinterpreting.

But we have to proceed.

Perhaps the feedback for guess 4 is: the second T is yellow, which means there is a T in the secret word that is not in position 3, and since position 1 is T, it must be that the secret word has a T in position 1 and another T in a position that is not 3, but the only other positions are 2,4,5, which are A, E, R, so it can't be.

Unless one of the fixed positions is not fixed? But they are green.

Let's assume that the green letters are correct, so position 1: T, 2: A, 4: E, 5: R.

Then the secret word is T A ? E R.

The feedback for the second T in ""tater"" is yellow, so there is a T in the secret word that is not in position 1 or 3. But position 1 is T, so there is another T not in position 3. But where? Position 2,4,5 are A,E,R, not T.

This is impossible.

Perhaps the secret word has a T in position 2 or 4 or 5, but that would contradict the green A, E, R.

I think there's a mistake in the initial deduction that position 5 is R.

Let me challenge that.

In guess 2: ""tares"" -> position 5 is S, which is absent, so position 5 is not S. R is in the word but not in position 3, so R could be in position 5.

In guess 3: ""taper"" -> we put R in position 5, and it was marked green, so position 5 is R.

But in guess 4: ""tater"" -> we put R in position 5, green, so it's confirmed.

Unless the green in position 5 for R is correct, so it is R.

I think we have to accept that the secret word is T A ? E R, and the ? is not T, but there is a T in the word, so it must be that the ? is a letter that is not T, but the secret word has a T in addition to the one in position 1, but there's no room.

Perhaps the secret word has three T's? Then position 3 could be T, and it should be green, but it's yellow, which is wrong.

I give up. Let's try to make a guess that doesn't assume position 5 is R.

But it is confirmed green.

Perhaps the feedback for guess 4: T(✓) A(✓) T(-) E(✓) R(✓) means that the secret word has T in position 1, A in 2, E in 4, R in 5, and also has a T that is not in position 3, so it must be in position 2,4, or 5, but they are occupied, so it must be that one of the green letters is not what we think.

But that doesn't make sense.

Another idea: in ""tater"", the first T is green, so it's correct. The second T is yellow, so there is a T in the secret word that is not in position 3. Since position 1 is already T, and it's used for the green, the yellow T must correspond to a different T in the secret word, which must be in position 2,4, or 5. But position 2 is A, which is not T, but if the secret word has T in position 2, then our guess has A in position 2, which is green, so it should be A, not T.

This is very confusing.

Perhaps the secret word is ""trait"" or ""tramp"", but that doesn't match the green letters.

Let's list all green letters:
- Position 1: T
- Position 2: A
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: R

So the word is T A _ E R.

Now, for the yellow T in position 3 in ""tater"", it means that the secret word has a T in a position that is not 3, and not 1 (because that T is already matched). So it must be in position 2,4, or 5. But position 2 is A, not T; position 4 is E, not T; position 5 is R, not T. So impossible.

Unless the secret word has a letter in position 2 that is both A and T? Impossible.

I think there's a mistake in the game or the feedback.

Perhaps the feedback for guess 4 is for a different word.

But we have to proceed.

Maybe the secret word has a T in position 3, and the feedback for the second T is green, but it's written as - by mistake.

But the feedback says T(-) for the second T.

Perhaps - means something else, but in the initial instructions, - means ""in the word but wrong position"".

I think we have to assume that the secret word has a T in a position that is not 3, and it must be that one of the other positions is not fixed, but they are.

Let's consider that in guess 2, when we had ""tares"", the E is in position 4 green, but perhaps the secret word has E in position 4 and also in another position? But we don't have evidence.

I recall that in guess 1, E is in position 5 and it was yellow, not green, so not in position 5.

In guess 2, E is in position 4 green.

So position 4 is E.

Similarly, all fixed.

Perhaps for guess 4, the second T is yellow because the secret word has T in position 5 or something, but position 5 is R.

I think we need to make a guess that includes T in a different position, but we can't because positions 1,2,4,5 are fixed.

The only position we can change is 3.

So for the next guess, we can try a different letter in position 3.

For example, ""tamer"" to test M.

But then we don't use the information from the yellow T.

The yellow T in guess 4 indicates that there is a T in the secret word that is not in position 3, and not in position 1. But since positions 2,4,5 are fixed and not T, it must be that the secret word has a T in position 3? But that would make the feedback for the second T in ""tater"" should be green, not yellow.

This is unsolvable with the given information.

Perhaps the secret word is ""taste"", but then position 4 is S, but we have E in position 4 green in guess 2 and 3.

In guess 2, ""tares"" has E in position 4 green, so position 4 is E.

I think there's a mistake in the feedback or in our understanding.

Let's assume that the feedback for the second T in ""tater"" is incorrect, and we should proceed with the fixed positions.

So the word is T A ? E R, and from guess 4, we know that the letter in position 3 is not T, but there is a T in the word, which must be in position 1, so no second T. But the feedback says there is a second T.

Perhaps the feedback for the second T is grey, but it's written as -.

In the initial instructions, - means ""in the word but wrong position"", x means not in the word.

In guess 4, it's written as T(-), so yellow.

I think we have to make a guess that has a T in a different position, but we can't because the other positions are fixed.

Perhaps for the next guess, we can try a word that has T in position 3 again, but that doesn't help.

Or try a word like ""tribe"", but that doesn't match the fixed letters.

I think we should guess ""tamer"" to test M in position 3.

So guess: ""tamer""

### Analysis of Feedback and Reasoning for Next Guess

#### Step-by-Step Thought Process:
1. **Current Known Information**:
   - **Secret Word Pattern**: From previous feedback, positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 are confirmed:
     - Position 1: **T** (green in Guesses 2, 3, 4).
     - Position 2: **A** (green in Guesses 2, 3, 4).
     - Position 4: **E** (green in Guesses 2, 3, 4).
     - Position 5: **R** (green in Guesses 3, 4).
   - **Position 3** is the only unknown letter.
   - **Absent Letters**: C, N, S (from Guess 1 and 2), and P (from Guess 3).
   - **Key Feedback from Guess 4 (""tater"")**:
     - The second **T** (in position 3) is marked as present but wrong position (`-`). This means:
       - The secret word contains a **second T** (since the first T is already fixed in position 1).
       - This second T cannot be in position 3 (due to the `-` feedback).
       - However, positions 2, 4, and 5 are fixed as A, E, and R (not T), creating a contradiction. This suggests the feedback may imply the secret word has a duplicate T, but its location is unresolved.

2. **Resolving the Contradiction**:
   - The feedback from Guess 4 (`T(-)` for position 3) is inconsistent with the fixed positions (T in 1, A in 2, E in 4, R in 5). This could indicate:
     - The secret word might have **three T's** (e.g., one in position 1, one in position 3, and one elsewhere), but positions 2/4/5 are fixed and not T.
     - Alternatively, the feedback may emphasize that position 3 is not T, but the secret word contains another T somewhere else—though no valid position exists.
   - Given the constraints, the most logical approach is to **test a new letter in position 3** while retaining the fixed T, A, E, R. This leverages the feedback that position 3 is not T (from Guess 4) and avoids wasting guesses on duplicates for now.

3. **Possible Words for `T A _ E R`**:
   - **TAMER** (uses **M** in position 3).
   - **TAKER** (uses **K** in position 3).
   - **TABER** or **TAXER** (less common, with B or X).
   - ""TATER"" is ruled out by Guess 4 feedback (T in position 3 is wrong).

4. **Strategy for Guess 5**:
   - **Why ""tamer""?** 
     - Tests **M** in position 3—a common letter not yet tried.
     - If correct, the puzzle is solved (e.g., ""tamer"").
     - If incorrect, feedback on M (absent/present) will narrow options:
       - If M is absent (`x`), focus on ""taker"" or other candidates next.
       - If M is present but wrong position (`-`), it would imply M is elsewhere, though positions 1-5 are mostly fixed (position 3 is the only unknown).
   - **Efficiency**: With 2 guesses left, testing a new letter (M) maximizes information. Guessing ""taker"" or a rare word (e.g., ""taber"") risks wasting a turn if wrong.

5. **Final Decision**: 
   - Guess **""tamer""** to resolve position 3 with a high-likelihood letter (M) and address the feedback from Guess 4.

<guess>tamer</guess>",tamer,"We have the feedback from Guess 4: ""tater""
- T: ✓ (correct in position 1)
- A: ✓ (correct in position 2)
- T: - (in the word but wrong position) — note: this is the second T, in position 3
- E: ✓ (correct in position 4)
- R: ✓ (correct in position 5)

This feedback is interesting because it shows that the third letter T is present but not in position 3. However, we already have T in position 1. So the secret word has at least two T's.

But the feedback says the T in position 3 is present but wrong position. That means the secret word has another T, but not in position 3.

But we already have T in position 1. So the secret word must have a T in a position other than 1 and 3? But position 1 is fixed as T, so the duplicate T must be in a different position. However, the only positions are 1,2,3,4,5.

Position 2 is A, position 4 is E, position 5 is R. So none of these are T. Therefore, the only possibility is that the secret word has a T in position 1 and another T in a position that is not 3? But we don't have any other position available? This seems contradictory.

Let me reexamine:

The secret word is T A ? E R.

We guessed ""tater"", which is T A T E R.

Feedback:
- First T (position 1): correct (✓)
- A (position 2): correct (✓)
- Second T (position 3): present but wrong position (-)
- E (position 4): correct (✓)
- R (position 5): correct (✓)

The feedback for the second T (position 3) is marked as present but wrong position. This means that the secret word has a T that is not in position 3. But we already have a T in position 1. So the secret word must have at least two T's: one in position 1 and one in another position. However, the other positions are 2,4,5, which are fixed as A, E, R. So they cannot be T. Therefore, it's impossible for the secret word to have a T in any other position? This is a contradiction.

Unless the secret word has more than two T's? But that would require a third T, which still has no place.

Perhaps the feedback is indicating that the T in position 3 is not in the word? But it's marked as present, meaning there is a T somewhere else? But we already accounted for position 1.

I think there might be a misunderstanding of the feedback.

The feedback for ""tater"" is: T(✓) A(✓) T(-) E(✓) R(✓)

This means:
- The first T (position 1) is correct and in the right place.
- The A (position 2) is correct.
- The second T (position 3) is in the word but not in position 3.
- E (position 4) is correct.
- R (position 5) is correct.

So the secret word has at least two T's: one in position 1 and one in another position. But the other positions are 2,3,4,5. We know position 2 is A, position 4 is E, position 5 is R, so they are not T. Therefore, the only possibility is that the secret word has a T in position 3? But the feedback says the T in position 3 is not in the correct position? That would be contradictory.

Unless the secret word has three T's? But then we would need a T in position 3 as well? But the feedback says the T in position 3 is not correct, meaning it's not in position 3? But if the secret word has a T in position 3, then it should be marked as correct.

This is confusing.

Perhaps the feedback system marks only one instance if there are duplicates? But in Wordle, if there are duplicate letters, it can mark multiple.

Standard Wordle rules: if you guess a letter that appears more times in the guess than in the secret, and one of them is in the correct position, then the extra one might be marked as absent. But in this case, the first T is correct, so the second T might be marked as absent if there is no second T? But here it's marked as present but wrong position.

The feedback for the second T is ""-"", which means it is in the word but not in that position. So there must be a second T in the secret word.

But where can it be? The only positions are 1,2,3,4,5. Position 1 is T, position 2 is A, position 4 is E, position 5 is R. So position 3 must be the only place for the second T? But the feedback says it's not in position 3? That's impossible.

Unless the secret word is not T A ? E R? But we have confirmed T in 1, A in 2, E in 4, R in 5 from previous guesses.

In guess 2: ""tares"" had T(✓) A(✓) E(✓) and R(-) S(x). And we deduced R must be in position 5.

In guess 3: ""taper"" had T(✓) A(✓) E(✓) R(✓) and P(x), which confirmed R in position 5.

So the pattern is fixed: T A ? E R.

The only unknown is position 3.

Now, when we guess ""tater"", which has T in position 3, the feedback says that T is present but not in position 3. But if the secret word has a T in position 3, it should be marked as correct. If it doesn't, and there is no second T, it should be marked as absent. But it's marked as present, so there is a second T, but not in position 3. But there is no other position for it.

This implies that our assumption that the secret word is T A ? E R is incorrect? But how? The feedback from previous guesses strongly supports it.

Let me double-check guess 2: ""tares"" -> T(✓) A(✓) R(-) E(✓) S(x)

This means:
- T in position 1 is correct.
- A in position 2 is correct.
- R is in the word but not in position 3.
- E in position 4 is correct.
- S is not in the word.

From this, we deduced that R must be in position 5 because positions 1,2,4 are taken, and position 3 is not available for R. But is that correct? The secret word has five positions. We know position 1: T, position 2: A, position 4: E, and R is in the word but not in position 3. So R must be in position 5. That seems solid.

Similarly, in guess 3: ""taper"" -> T(✓) A(✓) P(x) E(✓) R(✓) — this confirms R in position 5.

So the only unknown is position 3.

But then the feedback for ""tater"" doesn't make sense.

Unless the secret word has a letter in position 3 that is T, but the feedback is marking it as wrong because of the duplicate? But in Wordle, if the secret word has two T's and you guess two T's, one in the correct position and one in the wrong position, then the one in the correct position is marked green, and the one in the wrong position is marked yellow.

But in this case, for ""tater"", if the secret word is ""tater"", then position 3 should be green for T. But it's marked as yellow, which means it's not in position 3. So the secret word is not ""tater"".

But then what is it? It must have a T in a different position? But there is no different position.

Perhaps the secret word has T in position 1 and position 3, but the feedback for the second T is yellow because it's not in the correct position? But if it is in position 3 and the secret word has T in position 3, it should be green.

I think there's a mistake in the feedback interpretation.

Let me read the feedback again: Guess 4: tater -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) A(✓) T(-) E(✓) R(✓)

This means the first T is green, the second T is yellow.

For the second T to be yellow, the secret word must have a T that is not in position 3, and not in position 1 (because that T is already accounted for by the green T). So there must be a T in position 2,4, or 5. But position 2 is A, position 4 is E, position 5 is R, and they are fixed and not T. Contradiction.

Unless the fixed positions are not all correct? But they are marked green in multiple guesses.

In guess 2: T, A, E are green in positions 1,2,4.

In guess 3: T, A, E, R are green in positions 1,2,4,5.

In guess 4: T, A, E, R are green again, and the second T is yellow.

So positions 1,2,4,5 are fixed.

The only possibility is that the secret word has a T in one of the fixed positions? But they are occupied by other letters.

I think the only logical conclusion is that the secret word has a duplicate letter in position 3, but the letter is not T. But then why is the second T in ""tater"" marked as present? It must be that the secret word has a T in a position that is not 1,2,3,4,5? Impossible.

Perhaps the feedback for guess 4 is indicating that the second T is present, but it is not in position 3, and since position 1 is already T, it must be that the secret word has a T in a position that we haven't guessed? But we have guessed all positions.

I think there's a flaw in our earlier deduction that R is in position 5.

Let me revisit guess 2: ""tares""

- T in 1: green
- A in 2: green
- R in 3: yellow
- E in 4: green
- S in 5: absent

From this, we concluded that R must be in position 5 because it can't be in 3, and 1,2,4 are taken. But is it possible that R is in position 5? But in the guess, position 5 is S, which is absent, so position 5 is open. But the feedback for R is yellow, meaning R is in the word but not in position 3. It doesn't tell us where it is.

In guess 3: ""taper"" -> T(✓) A(✓) P(x) E(✓) R(✓)

Here, R is in position 5 and marked green. So that confirms R is in position 5.

So position 5 is R.

Unless the green R in position 5 in guess 3 is correct, so it is fixed.

But then in guess 4, we have R in position 5 green again.

So position 5 is R.

The only way out is that the secret word has more than one R? But in guess 2, we had R in position 3 yellow, and in guess 3, R in position 5 green. If the secret word has only one R, then in guess 2, the R in position 3 is yellow because the R is in position 5. In guess 3, R in position 5 is green.

In guess 4, ""tater"", we have R in position 5 green, and no other R. But we have two T's.

The feedback for the second T is yellow, so there is a second T in the secret word, but not in position 3. But where? The only possibility is that it is in position 2 or 4, but position 2 is A and position 4 is E, both fixed and green in multiple guesses.

This is impossible.

Perhaps the secret word is ""treat"" or something, but that doesn't match the fixed positions.

Let's list what we know for sure:

- Position 1: T (green in guess 2,3,4)
- Position 2: A (green in guess 2,3,4)
- Position 4: E (green in guess 2,3,4)
- Position 5: R (green in guess 3,4) — in guess 2, R was in position 3 and yellow, but position 5 was S which was absent, so position 5 must be R.

So the word is T A ? E R.

Now, for ""tater"" guess: the second T in position 3 is yellow. This means that in the secret word, there is a T that is not in position 3 and not in position 1 (because that T is already used for the green). So there must be a T in position 2,4, or 5. But position 2 is A, not T; position 4 is E, not T; position 5 is R, not T. Contradiction.

The only way this can be resolved is if the secret word has a letter in position 3 that is T, but the feedback is not marking it as green for some reason? But that doesn't make sense.

Perhaps the feedback for guess 4 is incorrect, but we have to work with it.

Another possibility: in Wordle, if you guess a letter that appears more times in the guess than in the secret, and one of them is in the correct position, the extras may be marked as absent if there are no more of that letter. But in this case, the second T is marked as present (yellow), so there must be a second T in the secret word.

But where? The only position left is 3, but it's marked as not in position 3.

I think there's a mistake in the initial setup.

Perhaps the secret word has T in position 1 and position 3, but the feedback for the second T is yellow because the first T is already green, and the second T is not needed? But that's not how it works. If the secret word has two T's, and you guess two T's, one in position 1 (green) and one in position 3, and if position 3 is also T, it should be green.

Unless the secret word has only one T, in position 1. Then the second T in position 3 should be marked as absent (grey). But it's marked as yellow, which means present but wrong position, so there must be a second T.

I'm stuck.

Let's ignore the deduction for a moment and list the feedback again.

Guess 1: crane
- C: x
- R: - (in word, not position 2)
- A: - (in word, not position 3)
- N: x
- E: - (in word, not position 5)

Guess 2: tares
- T: ✓ (position 1)
- A: ✓ (position 2)
- R: - (in word, not position 3)
- E: ✓ (position 4)
- S: x

Guess 3: taper
- T: ✓ (position 1)
- A: ✓ (position 2)
- P: x
- E: ✓ (position 4)
- R: ✓ (position 5)

Guess 4: tater
- T: ✓ (position 1)
- A: ✓ (position 2)
- T: - (in word, not position 3)  [second T]
- E: ✓ (position 4)
- R: ✓ (position 5)

From guess 2, we have R is in the word but not in position 3. From guess 3, R is in position 5 and correct.

From guess 4, the second T is in the word but not in position 3.

The secret word has: T in 1, A in 2, E in 4, R in 5, and an unknown in 3.

Additionally, it has another T somewhere. But where? The only position is 3, but it's not in 3, and the other positions are filled.

Unless the secret word is not 5 letters? But it is.

Perhaps the feedback for the second T in ""tater"" is for a T that is not in position 1 or 3, but in a different position, but there is no different position.

I think the only logical explanation is that the secret word has a T in position 3, but the feedback is yellow because the first T is already green, and the system is indicating that there is a T in the word but not in position 3 for the second T? But that doesn't make sense because if position 3 is T, it should be green.

Perhaps in the feedback, the first T is green, so the second T is not needed and is marked as grey if there is no second T, or yellow if there is a second T elsewhere. But in this case, if position 3 is T, it should be green.

I recall that in Wordle, for duplicate letters, if the secret word has two of a letter, and you guess two of that letter, with one in the correct position and the other in a wrong position, the one in the correct position is green, and the one in the wrong position is yellow. If both are in wrong positions, both yellow. If one is in correct position and the other in a wrong position, green and yellow.

But if the secret word has only one T, and you guess two T's, with one in the correct position, the other is grey.

In this case, for ""tater"", if the secret word has only one T (in position 1), then the second T should be grey. But it's yellow, so there must be a second T in the secret word.

But where can it be? The only position left is 3, so it must be in position 3. But then it should be green, not yellow.

This is a paradox.

Unless the secret word has a T in a position that is not 1,2,3,4,5? Impossible.

Perhaps the fixed positions are not all correct? But they are marked green in multiple guesses.

Another idea: in guess 2, when we had ""tares"", position 5 is S, which is absent, so position 5 is not S. In guess 3, we put R in position 5 and it was green, so position 5 is R.

But in guess 4, we have R in position 5 green, so it's fixed.

I think the only way is to consider that the secret word has a letter in position 3 that is not T, but the second T in ""tater"" is marked as yellow because there is a T in the word that is not yet identified, but we have position 1 T.

Perhaps the secret word has T in position 1 and also in position 3, but the feedback system has a bug or we are misinterpreting.

But we have to proceed.

Perhaps the feedback for guess 4 is: the second T is yellow, which means there is a T in the secret word that is not in position 3, and since position 1 is T, it must be that the secret word has a T in position 1 and another T in a position that is not 3, but the only other positions are 2,4,5, which are A, E, R, so it can't be.

Unless one of the fixed positions is not fixed? But they are green.

Let's assume that the green letters are correct, so position 1: T, 2: A, 4: E, 5: R.

Then the secret word is T A ? E R.

The feedback for the second T in ""tater"" is yellow, so there is a T in the secret word that is not in position 1 or 3. But position 1 is T, so there is another T not in position 3. But where? Position 2,4,5 are A,E,R, not T.

This is impossible.

Perhaps the secret word has a T in position 2 or 4 or 5, but that would contradict the green A, E, R.

I think there's a mistake in the initial deduction that position 5 is R.

Let me challenge that.

In guess 2: ""tares"" -> position 5 is S, which is absent, so position 5 is not S. R is in the word but not in position 3, so R could be in position 5.

In guess 3: ""taper"" -> we put R in position 5, and it was marked green, so position 5 is R.

But in guess 4: ""tater"" -> we put R in position 5, green, so it's confirmed.

Unless the green in position 5 for R is correct, so it is R.

I think we have to accept that the secret word is T A ? E R, and the ? is not T, but there is a T in the word, so it must be that the ? is a letter that is not T, but the secret word has a T in addition to the one in position 1, but there's no room.

Perhaps the secret word has three T's? Then position 3 could be T, and it should be green, but it's yellow, which is wrong.

I give up. Let's try to make a guess that doesn't assume position 5 is R.

But it is confirmed green.

Perhaps the feedback for guess 4: T(✓) A(✓) T(-) E(✓) R(✓) means that the secret word has T in position 1, A in 2, E in 4, R in 5, and also has a T that is not in position 3, so it must be in position 2,4, or 5, but they are occupied, so it must be that one of the green letters is not what we think.

But that doesn't make sense.

Another idea: in ""tater"", the first T is green, so it's correct. The second T is yellow, so there is a T in the secret word that is not in position 3. Since position 1 is already T, and it's used for the green, the yellow T must correspond to a different T in the secret word, which must be in position 2,4, or 5. But position 2 is A, which is not T, but if the secret word has T in position 2, then our guess has A in position 2, which is green, so it should be A, not T.

This is very confusing.

Perhaps the secret word is ""trait"" or ""tramp"", but that doesn't match the green letters.

Let's list all green letters:
- Position 1: T
- Position 2: A
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: R

So the word is T A _ E R.

Now, for the yellow T in position 3 in ""tater"", it means that the secret word has a T in a position that is not 3, and not 1 (because that T is already matched). So it must be in position 2,4, or 5. But position 2 is A, not T; position 4 is E, not T; position 5 is R, not T. So impossible.

Unless the secret word has a letter in position 2 that is both A and T? Impossible.

I think there's a mistake in the game or the feedback.

Perhaps the feedback for guess 4 is for a different word.

But we have to proceed.

Maybe the secret word has a T in position 3, and the feedback for the second T is green, but it's written as - by mistake.

But the feedback says T(-) for the second T.

Perhaps - means something else, but in the initial instructions, - means ""in the word but wrong position"".

I think we have to assume that the secret word has a T in a position that is not 3, and it must be that one of the other positions is not fixed, but they are.

Let's consider that in guess 2, when we had ""tares"", the E is in position 4 green, but perhaps the secret word has E in position 4 and also in another position? But we don't have evidence.

I recall that in guess 1, E is in position 5 and it was yellow, not green, so not in position 5.

In guess 2, E is in position 4 green.

So position 4 is E.

Similarly, all fixed.

Perhaps for guess 4, the second T is yellow because the secret word has T in position 5 or something, but position 5 is R.

I think we need to make a guess that includes T in a different position, but we can't because positions 1,2,4,5 are fixed.

The only position we can change is 3.

So for the next guess, we can try a different letter in position 3.

For example, ""tamer"" to test M.

But then we don't use the information from the yellow T.

The yellow T in guess 4 indicates that there is a T in the secret word that is not in position 3, and not in position 1. But since positions 2,4,5 are fixed and not T, it must be that the secret word has a T in position 3? But that would make the feedback for the second T in ""tater"" should be green, not yellow.

This is unsolvable with the given information.

Perhaps the secret word is ""taste"", but then position 4 is S, but we have E in position 4 green in guess 2 and 3.

In guess 2, ""tares"" has E in position 4 green, so position 4 is E.

I think there's a mistake in the feedback or in our understanding.

Let's assume that the feedback for the second T in ""tater"" is incorrect, and we should proceed with the fixed positions.

So the word is T A ? E R, and from guess 4, we know that the letter in position 3 is not T, but there is a T in the word, which must be in position 1, so no second T. But the feedback says there is a second T.

Perhaps the feedback for the second T is grey, but it's written as -.

In the initial instructions, - means ""in the word but wrong position"", x means not in the word.

In guess 4, it's written as T(-), so yellow.

I think we have to make a guess that has a T in a different position, but we can't because the other positions are fixed.

Perhaps for the next guess, we can try a word that has T in position 3 again, but that doesn't help.

Or try a word like ""tribe"", but that doesn't match the fixed letters.

I think we should guess ""tamer"" to test M in position 3.

So guess: ""tamer""

<guess>tamer</guess>### Analysis of Feedback and Reasoning for Next Guess

#### Step-by-Step Thought Process:
1. **Current Known Information**:
   - **Secret Word Pattern**: From previous feedback, positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 are confirmed:
     - Position 1: **T** (green in Guesses 2, 3, 4).
     - Position 2: **A** (green in Guesses 2, 3, 4).
     - Position 4: **E** (green in Guesses 2, 3, 4).
     - Position 5: **R** (green in Guesses 3, 4).
   - **Position 3** is the only unknown letter.
   - **Absent Letters**: C, N, S (from Guess 1 and 2), and P (from Guess 3).
   - **Key Feedback from Guess 4 (""tater"")**:
     - The second **T** (in position 3) is marked as present but wrong position (`-`). This means:
       - The secret word contains a **second T** (since the first T is already fixed in position 1).
       - This second T cannot be in position 3 (due to the `-` feedback).
       - However, positions 2, 4, and 5 are fixed as A, E, and R (not T), creating a contradiction. This suggests the feedback may imply the secret word has a duplicate T, but its location is unresolved.

2. **Resolving the Contradiction**:
   - The feedback from Guess 4 (`T(-)` for position 3) is inconsistent with the fixed positions (T in 1, A in 2, E in 4, R in 5). This could indicate:
     - The secret word might have **three T's** (e.g., one in position 1, one in position 3, and one elsewhere), but positions 2/4/5 are fixed and not T.
     - Alternatively, the feedback may emphasize that position 3 is not T, but the secret word contains another T somewhere else—though no valid position exists.
   - Given the constraints, the most logical approach is to **test a new letter in position 3** while retaining the fixed T, A, E, R. This leverages the feedback that position 3 is not T (from Guess 4) and avoids wasting guesses on duplicates for now.

3. **Possible Words for `T A _ E R`**:
   - **TAMER** (uses **M** in position 3).
   - **TAKER** (uses **K** in position 3).
   - **TABER** or **TAXER** (less common, with B or X).
   - ""TATER"" is ruled out by Guess 4 feedback (T in position 3 is wrong).

4. **Strategy for Guess 5**:
   - **Why ""tamer""?** 
     - Tests **M** in position 3—a common letter not yet tried.
     - If correct, the puzzle is solved (e.g., ""tamer"").
     - If incorrect, feedback on M (absent/present) will narrow options:
       - If M is absent (`x`), focus on ""taker"" or other candidates next.
       - If M is present but wrong position (`-`), it would imply M is elsewhere, though positions 1-5 are mostly fixed (position 3 is the only unknown).
   - **Efficiency**: With 2 guesses left, testing a new letter (M) maximizes information. Guessing ""taker"" or a rare word (e.g., ""taber"") risks wasting a turn if wrong.

5. **Final Decision**: 
   - Guess **""tamer""** to resolve position 3 with a high-likelihood letter (M) and address the feedback from Guess 4.",Guess 5: tamer -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) A(✓) M(✓) E(✓) R(✓),SUCCESS
