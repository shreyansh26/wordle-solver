We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get. Ideally, we choose a word with 5 distinct letters that are common in 5-letter words. A common starting word is ""CRATE"" or ""SLATE"" or ""ROATE"". Another popular starting word is ""RAISE"". Let's choose ""RAISE"" because it has common letters: R, A, I, S, E.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that maximizes information gain by using common letters and avoiding duplicates. The word ""RAISE"" is a strong starter because it contains five distinct letters: R, A, I, S, and E. These letters are among the most frequent in English 5-letter words, increasing the likelihood of revealing correct positions or existing letters in the secret word. If any letters match (with ✓ or -), future guesses can build on this information efficiently. If none appear (all x), that still significantly narrows possibilities.

We are given feedback on the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The letter S is in the secret word, but not in the 4th position (since in RAISE, S is the 4th letter and we got a '-' meaning it's present but misplaced).
- The letters R, A, I, E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains S and it must be in one of the positions: 1, 2, 3, or 5 (since it's not in position 4). But note that in the feedback, S was in position 4 and was marked as present but wrong position, so S is definitely in the word, just not at position 4.

We also know that the secret word does not contain R, A, I, or E.

For the next guess, we need to choose a 5-letter word that:
- Includes the letter S (since we know it's in the word) but not in the 4th position (because we already tried that and it was wrong).
- Avoids the letters R, A, I, E (since they are not in the word).
- We want to test other common letters to get more information.

We have 6 tries, so we can use this guess to narrow down the position of S and also test new letters.

Possible positions for S: 1, 2, 3, 5.

We should also try to include other common consonants and vowels that we haven't tried. Since we know the word has S, and we have eliminated R, A, I, E, the remaining vowels are O, U and sometimes Y. Consonants we haven't tried include T, N, L, C, D, H, etc.

A good strategy is to pick a word that has S in a different position and uses new letters to cover more ground.

Let's think of words that have S and avoid R, A, I, E.

For example, we can try S in the first position: words like ""SOUTH"", ""SONIC"", ""SOLID"", etc.

But note: we also want to test other common letters. Since we have only one confirmed letter (S) and four new positions to test, we should choose a word with as many new common letters as possible.

Alternatively, we can try S in the second position: words like ""USUAL"" (but U is repeated and we have A which is eliminated? Wait, A is eliminated so we cannot use A). We must avoid A.

Let me list some candidate words:

- S in position 1: 
  - S with O: ""SOLAR"" (but has A and R, which are eliminated) -> invalid.
  - ""SONLY"" (not a word) 
  - ""SONGS"" (has S repeated, and we don't know if S is repeated, but it's acceptable; however, we are avoiding A, R, I, E, so this is okay? But S is repeated and we don't know if the word has two S's. Also, we are trying to get new letters. ""SONGS"" has O, N, G, S. But S is at position 1 and 5. We know S is in the word, but we don't know if it's repeated. We can try, but maybe not the best because we are repeating S and we might not get information about other letters.

We want to use distinct letters if possible to maximize information.

So, let's try to find a word with S in position 1 and four new distinct letters that are not R, A, I, E.

Possible words: 
- ""SOUTH"" -> S, O, U, T, H. All distinct and new. This is a good candidate.
- ""SHOWN"" -> S, H, O, W, N. Also good.
- ""SLUNG"" -> S, L, U, N, G. Good.

But note: we have eliminated E, so we don't have to worry about that.

Alternatively, S in position 2: 
- Words like ""USHER"" (has E and R, eliminated) -> invalid.
- ""PSYCH"" (not 5 letters? ""PSYCH"" is not a word, but ""PSYCH"" is a root, not a word. We need valid words.)
- ""MUSTY"" -> M, U, S, T, Y. S is in position 3? Let's see: M (1), U (2), S (3), T (4), Y (5). So if we put S in position 3, that's a new position. But we want to test S in a position we haven't tried? We only tried position 4 so far. So positions 1,2,3,5 are available.

We can try S in position 3? But in the first guess, we had S in position 4 and it was misplaced. So we know S is in the word but not at position 4. We can try any of 1,2,3,5.

But to maximize information, we might want to try a position that is common for S, such as the beginning or the end.

Another candidate: S in position 5: 
- Words like ""FOCUS"" -> F, O, C, U, S. S at the end. This is good because we test S at position 5 and new letters.

But note: we also want to cover more common letters. The most common consonants in English are T, N, S, L, R (but R is eliminated), so T, N, L are good to test.

Also, vowels: we have only tested A, I, E and they are out. So we should test O and U.

Therefore, a word that includes S (not in position 4) and also includes T, N, L, O, U, etc.

Let me think of a word that has S and T, for example.

One classic second guess after getting one letter is to try a word that places the known letter in a different position and uses new common letters.

I think ""SOUTH"" is a strong candidate: 
- S at position 1 (new position)
- O, U, T, H: all new and common.

Another candidate: ""SHUNT"" -> S, H, U, N, T. S at position 1, and we test H, U, N, T.

But ""SOUTH"" is more common.

Alternatively, ""STOMP"" -> S, T, O, M, P. But we have S at 1 and T at 2.

But we don't know if the word has T or not.

We can also consider ""LUSTY"" -> L, U, S, T, Y. S at position 3. This tests L, U, S (at 3), T, Y.

But we are testing S at position 3, which is a new position.

I think ""SOUTH"" is a good choice because:
- It places S at position 1 (we haven't tried S at 1)
- It tests O, U, T, H which are common and we haven't tried them.

So, let's go with ""SOUTH"".

But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""SOUTH"" is a valid English word.

Therefore, the next guess is ""SOUTH"".

We'll see if S is at position 1 (if we get a check) or if it's elsewhere (if we get a minus). Also, we'll get information about O, U, T, H.

If S is not at position 1, we might get a minus for S, meaning it's in the word but not at 1, and then we know it must be at 2,3, or 5 (since 4 is already tried and we know it's not there).

But we are trying position 1 now.

So, I think ""SOUTH"" is a good second guess.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, A, I, E are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- S is in the secret word but **not in the 4th position** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- The word must include **S** (since it's confirmed in the secret word) but avoid placing it in the 4th position again.
- It should exclude R, A, I, E (as they are absent from the secret word).
- To maximize information, the guess should test new common letters (e.g., O, U, T, H, N, L) and position S in a new location (e.g., position 1, 2, 3, or 5).

A strong candidate is **""SOUTH""**:
- Places S in position 1 (a new position to test).
- Introduces new common letters: O, U, T, H.
- Avoids R, A, I, E and uses distinct letters for efficient feedback.

  - ""SONGS"" (has S repeated, and we don't know if S is repeated, but it's acceptable; however, we are avoiding A, R, I, E, so this is okay? But S is repeated and we don't know if the word has two S's. Also, we are trying to get new letters. ""SONGS"" has O, N, G, S. But S is at position 1 and 5. We know S is in the word, but we don't know if it's repeated. We can try, but maybe not the best because we are repeating S and we might not get information about other letters.

We want to use distinct letters if possible to maximize information.

So, let's try to find a word with S in position 1 and four new distinct letters that are not R, A, I, E.

Possible words: 
- ""SOUTH"" -> S, O, U, T, H. All distinct and new. This is a good candidate.
- ""SHOWN"" -> S, H, O, W, N. Also good.
- ""SLUNG"" -> S, L, U, N, G. Good.

But note: we have eliminated E, so we don't have to worry about that.

Alternatively, S in position 2: 
- Words like ""USHER"" (has E and R, eliminated) -> invalid.
- ""PSYCH"" (not 5 letters? ""PSYCH"" is not a word, but ""PSYCH"" is a root, not a word. We need valid words.)
- ""MUSTY"" -> M, U, S, T, Y. S is in position 3? Let's see: M (1), U (2), S (3), T (4), Y (5). So if we put S in position 3, that's a new position. But we want to test S in a position we haven't tried? We only tried position 4 so far. So positions 1,2,3,5 are available.

We can try S in position 3? But in the first guess, we had S in position 4 and it was misplaced. So we know S is in the word but not at position 4. We can try any of 1,2,3,5.

But to maximize information, we might want to try a position that is common for S, such as the beginning or the end.

Another candidate: S in position 5: 
- Words like ""FOCUS"" -> F, O, C, U, S. S at the end. This is good because we test S at position 5 and new letters.

But note: we also want to cover more common letters. The most common consonants in English are T, N, S, L, R (but R is eliminated), so T, N, L are good to test.

Also, vowels: we have only tested A, I, E and they are out. So we should test O and U.

Therefore, a word that includes S (not in position 4) and also includes T, N, L, O, U, etc.

Let me think of a word that has S and T, for example.

One classic second guess after getting one letter is to try a word that places the known letter in a different position and uses new common letters.

I think ""SOUTH"" is a strong candidate: 
- S at position 1 (new position)
- O, U, T, H: all new and common.

Another candidate: ""SHUNT"" -> S, H, U, N, T. S at position 1, and we test H, U, N, T.

But ""SOUTH"" is more common.

Alternatively, ""STOMP"" -> S, T, O, M, P. But we have S at 1 and T at 2.

But we don't know if the word has T or not.

We can also consider ""LUSTY"" -> L, U, S, T, Y. S at position 3. This tests L, U, S (at 3), T, Y.

But we are testing S at position 3, which is a new position.

I think ""SOUTH"" is a good choice because:
- It places S at position 1 (we haven't tried S at 1)
- It tests O, U, T, H which are common and we haven't tried them.

So, let's go with ""SOUTH"".

But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""SOUTH"" is a valid English word.

Therefore, the next guess is ""SOUTH"".

We'll see if S is at position 1 (if we get a check) or if it's elsewhere (if we get a minus). Also, we'll get information about O, U, T, H.

If S is not at position 1, we might get a minus for S, meaning it's in the word but not at 1, and then we know it must be at 2,3, or 5 (since 4 is already tried and we know it's not there).

But we are trying position 1 now.

So, I think ""SOUTH"" is a good second guess.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, A, I, E are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- S is in the secret word but **not in the 4th position** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- The word must include **S** (since it's confirmed in the secret word) but avoid placing it in the 4th position again.
- It should exclude R, A, I, E (as they are absent from the secret word).
- To maximize information, the guess should test new common letters (e.g., O, U, T, H, N, L) and position S in a new location (e.g., position 1, 2, 3, or 5).

A strong candidate is **""SOUTH""**:
- Places S in position 1 (a new position to test).
- Introduces new common letters: O, U, T, H.
- Avoids R, A, I, E and uses distinct letters for efficient feedback.

Alright, let me figure this out step by step. From the first guess ""RAISE"", we know that S is in the word but not in the fourth position, and R, A, I, E are definitely not in the word. 

Now looking at the second guess ""SOUTH"":
- S(-) means S is still in the word but not in the first position (since we placed it there)
- O(x) is new information - O is not in the word at all
- U(-) means U is in the word but not in the third position
- T(x) means T is not in the word
- H(-) means H is in the word but not in the fifth position

So combining everything we know:
Confirmed in word: S, U, H
Confirmed not in word: R, A, I, E, O, T
Position constraints:
- S cannot be in pos 1 or 4
- U cannot be in pos 3
- H cannot be in pos 5

Possible positions left for S: 2 or 3
For U: 1,2,4,5
For H: 1,2,3,4

Now we need a word that:
1. Contains S (in pos 2 or 3), U and H
2. Avoids R,A,I,E,O,T
3. Has two new letters to test

Considering letter frequency, good candidates might be consonants like N, L, M or vowel Y. Since three letters are already confirmed, we can use the remaining positions to test new letters.

Possible words come to mind:
""SHULY"" - but not a valid word
""PUSHY"" - has P,Y and positions S(3),U(2),H(5). Checking positions:
- S is in pos 3? Could work
- U in pos 2? Possible
- H in pos 5? But H cannot be in pos 5 as per feedback (H(-) in SOUTH means H is not in pos 5)

I need to mind the position constraints. H cannot be in pos 5, U cannot be in pos 3, S cannot be in pos 1 or 4.

Another idea: ""BUSHW"" - not valid
""LUSHY"" - valid word: L U S H Y
Breakdown:
- Pos2 U - U can be here? Feedback said U was not in pos 3, but pos2 is okay
- Pos3 S - S can be in pos3 (since not 1 or 4)
- Pos4 H - H can be in pos4 (since not 5)
- Pos1 L (new letter)
- Pos5 Y (new letter)

Constraints satisfied:
- S is in pos3 (allowed)
- U in pos2 (not pos3, good)
- H in pos4 (not pos5, good)
No R,A,I,E,O,T used

This looks promising. Another option could be ""MUSHY"" but contains M instead of L.

Both test two new consonants. Since L is slightly more common than M, ""LUSHY"" might be slightly better for information gain. Also ""Y"" at the end might be less common but worth including.

So ""LUSHY"" seems like a strong candidate - it places all known letters in new valid positions and tests L and Y for the remaining spots.

Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

### Key Information from Feedback:
1. **From RAISE (Guess 1):**  
   - `R`, `A`, `I`, `E` are **not in the word** (all ""x"").  
   - `S` is in the word but **not in position 4** (marked ""-"").

2. **From SOUTH (Guess 2):**  
   - `S` is in the word but **not in position 1** (marked ""-"").  
   - `O` and `T` are **not in the word** (both ""x"").  
   - `U` is in the word but **not in position 3** (marked ""-"").  
   - `H` is in the word but **not in position 5** (marked ""-"").

### Deductions:
- **Confirmed letters in the secret word**: `S`, `U`, `H`.  
- **Confirmed absent letters**: `R`, `A`, `I`, `E`, `O`, `T`.  
- **Position constraints**:  
  - `S` must be in **position 2 or 3** (since it is not in 1 or 4).  
  - `U` cannot be in position 3.  
  - `H` cannot be in position 5.  
- **Remaining vowel/consonant options**: The word excludes common vowels like `A`, `E`, `I`, `O`, so `U` (already confirmed) is the primary vowel. Consonants like `L`, `N`, `M`, `Y`, `P`, `B`, or `C` are candidates for testing.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- The guess must include `S`, `U`, and `H` while adhering to position constraints.  
- Place `S` in position 2 or 3 to test its correct location.  
- Place `U` and `H` in new positions (e.g., not position 3 for `U`, not position 5 for `H`).  
- Test **two new letters** to maximize information (e.g., `L` and `Y`).  
- Avoid absent letters (`R`, `A`, `I`, `E`, `O`, `T`).  

### Selected Guess: **LUSHY**
- **Why this word?**  
  - `L` (position 1): Tests a new common letter.  
  - `U` (position 2): Valid position (not position 3).  
  - `S` (position 3): Tests a new location for `S` (allowed by constraints).  
  - `H` (position 4): Valid position (not position 5).  
  - `Y` (position 5): Tests a less common letter.  
- This word respects all constraints, uses confirmed letters (`S`, `U`, `H`) in new positions, and tests two untried letters (`L` and `Y`).

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The letter S is in the secret word, but not in the 4th position (since in RAISE, S is the 4th letter and we got a '-' meaning it's present but misplaced).
- The letters R, A, I, E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains S and it must be in one of the positions: 1, 2, 3, or 5 (since it's not in position 4). But note that in the feedback, S was in position 4 and was marked as present but wrong position, so S is definitely in the word, just not at position 4.

We also know that the secret word does not contain R, A, I, or E.

For the next guess, we need to choose a 5-letter word that:
- Includes the letter S (since we know it's in the word) but not in the 4th position (because we already tried that and it was wrong).
- Avoids the letters R, A, I, E (since they are not in the word).
- We want to test other common letters to get more information.

We have 6 tries, so we can use this guess to narrow down the position of S and also test new letters.

Possible positions for S: 1, 2, 3, 5.

We should also try to include other common consonants and vowels that we haven't tried. Since we know the word has S, and we have eliminated R, A, I, E, the remaining vowels are O, U and sometimes Y. Consonants we haven't tried include T, N, L, C, D, H, etc.

A good strategy is to pick a word that has S in a different position and uses new letters to cover more ground.

Let's think of words that have S and avoid R, A, I, E.

For example, we can try S in the first position: words like ""SOUTH"", ""SONIC"", ""SOLID"", etc.

But note: we also want to test other common letters. Since we have only one confirmed letter (S) and four new positions to test, we should choose a word with as many new common letters as possible.

Alternatively, we can try S in the second position: words like ""USUAL"" (but U is repeated and we have A which is eliminated? Wait, A is eliminated so we cannot use A). We must avoid A.

Let me list some candidate words:

- S in position 1: 
  - S with O: ""SOLAR"" (but has A and R, which are eliminated) -> invalid.
  - ""SONLY"" (not a word) 
  - ""SONGS"" (has S repeated, and we don't know if S is repeated, but it's acceptable; however, we are avoiding A, R, I, E, so this is okay? But S is repeated and we don't know if the word has two S's. Also, we are trying to get new letters. ""SONGS"" has O, N, G, S. But S is at position 1 and 5. We know S is in the word, but we don't know if it's repeated. We can try, but maybe not the best because we are repeating S and we might not get information about other letters.

We want to use distinct letters if possible to maximize information.

So, let's try to find a word with S in position 1 and four new distinct letters that are not R, A, I, E.

Possible words: 
- ""SOUTH"" -> S, O, U, T, H. All distinct and new. This is a good candidate.
- ""SHOWN"" -> S, H, O, W, N. Also good.
- ""SLUNG"" -> S, L, U, N, G. Good.

But note: we have eliminated E, so we don't have to worry about that.

Alternatively, S in position 2: 
- Words like ""USHER"" (has E and R, eliminated) -> invalid.
- ""PSYCH"" (not 5 letters? ""PSYCH"" is not a word, but ""PSYCH"" is a root, not a word. We need valid words.)
- ""MUSTY"" -> M, U, S, T, Y. S is in position 3? Let's see: M (1), U (2), S (3), T (4), Y (5). So if we put S in position 3, that's a new position. But we want to test S in a position we haven't tried? We only tried position 4 so far. So positions 1,2,3,5 are available.

We can try S in position 3? But in the first guess, we had S in position 4 and it was misplaced. So we know S is in the word but not at position 4. We can try any of 1,2,3,5.

But to maximize information, we might want to try a position that is common for S, such as the beginning or the end.

Another candidate: S in position 5: 
- Words like ""FOCUS"" -> F, O, C, U, S. S at the end. This is good because we test S at position 5 and new letters.

But note: we also want to cover more common letters. The most common consonants in English are T, N, S, L, R (but R is eliminated), so T, N, L are good to test.

Also, vowels: we have only tested A, I, E and they are out. So we should test O and U.

Therefore, a word that includes S (not in position 4) and also includes T, N, L, O, U, etc.

Let me think of a word that has S and T, for example.

One classic second guess after getting one letter is to try a word that places the known letter in a different position and uses new common letters.

I think ""SOUTH"" is a strong candidate: 
- S at position 1 (new position)
- O, U, T, H: all new and common.

Another candidate: ""SHUNT"" -> S, H, U, N, T. S at position 1, and we test H, U, N, T.

But ""SOUTH"" is more common.

Alternatively, ""STOMP"" -> S, T, O, M, P. But we have S at 1 and T at 2.

But we don't know if the word has T or not.

We can also consider ""LUSTY"" -> L, U, S, T, Y. S at position 3. This tests L, U, S (at 3), T, Y.

But we are testing S at position 3, which is a new position.

I think ""SOUTH"" is a good choice because:
- It places S at position 1 (we haven't tried S at 1)
- It tests O, U, T, H which are common and we haven't tried them.

So, let's go with ""SOUTH"".

But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""SOUTH"" is a valid English word.

Therefore, the next guess is ""SOUTH"".

We'll see if S is at position 1 (if we get a check) or if it's elsewhere (if we get a minus). Also, we'll get information about O, U, T, H.

If S is not at position 1, we might get a minus for S, meaning it's in the word but not at 1, and then we know it must be at 2,3, or 5 (since 4 is already tried and we know it's not there).

But we are trying position 1 now.

So, I think ""SOUTH"" is a good second guess.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, A, I, E are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- S is in the secret word but **not in the 4th position** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- The word must include **S** (since it's confirmed in the secret word) but avoid placing it in the 4th position again.
- It should exclude R, A, I, E (as they are absent from the secret word).
- To maximize information, the guess should test new common letters (e.g., O, U, T, H, N, L) and position S in a new location (e.g., position 1, 2, 3, or 5).

A strong candidate is **""SOUTH""**:
- Places S in position 1 (a new position to test).
- Introduces new common letters: O, U, T, H.
- Avoids R, A, I, E and uses distinct letters for efficient feedback.

<guess>SOUTH</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SOUTH -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(x) U(-) T(x) H(-)
<｜Assistant｜>Alright, let me figure this out step by step. From the first guess ""RAISE"", we know that S is in the word but not in the fourth position, and R, A, I, E are definitely not in the word. 

Now looking at the second guess ""SOUTH"":
- S(-) means S is still in the word but not in the first position (since we placed it there)
- O(x) is new information - O is not in the word at all
- U(-) means U is in the word but not in the third position
- T(x) means T is not in the word
- H(-) means H is in the word but not in the fifth position

So combining everything we know:
Confirmed in word: S, U, H
Confirmed not in word: R, A, I, E, O, T
Position constraints:
- S cannot be in pos 1 or 4
- U cannot be in pos 3
- H cannot be in pos 5

Possible positions left for S: 2 or 3
For U: 1,2,4,5
For H: 1,2,3,4

Now we need a word that:
1. Contains S (in pos 2 or 3), U and H
2. Avoids R,A,I,E,O,T
3. Has two new letters to test

Considering letter frequency, good candidates might be consonants like N, L, M or vowel Y. Since three letters are already confirmed, we can use the remaining positions to test new letters.

Possible words come to mind:
""SHULY"" - but not a valid word
""PUSHY"" - has P,Y and positions S(3),U(2),H(5). Checking positions:
- S is in pos 3? Could work
- U in pos 2? Possible
- H in pos 5? But H cannot be in pos 5 as per feedback (H(-) in SOUTH means H is not in pos 5)

I need to mind the position constraints. H cannot be in pos 5, U cannot be in pos 3, S cannot be in pos 1 or 4.

Another idea: ""BUSHW"" - not valid
""LUSHY"" - valid word: L U S H Y
Breakdown:
- Pos2 U - U can be here? Feedback said U was not in pos 3, but pos2 is okay
- Pos3 S - S can be in pos3 (since not 1 or 4)
- Pos4 H - H can be in pos4 (since not 5)
- Pos1 L (new letter)
- Pos5 Y (new letter)

Constraints satisfied:
- S is in pos3 (allowed)
- U in pos2 (not pos3, good)
- H in pos4 (not pos5, good)
No R,A,I,E,O,T used

This looks promising. Another option could be ""MUSHY"" but contains M instead of L.

Both test two new consonants. Since L is slightly more common than M, ""LUSHY"" might be slightly better for information gain. Also ""Y"" at the end might be less common but worth including.

So ""LUSHY"" seems like a strong candidate - it places all known letters in new valid positions and tests L and Y for the remaining spots.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

### Key Information from Feedback:
1. **From RAISE (Guess 1):**  
   - `R`, `A`, `I`, `E` are **not in the word** (all ""x"").  
   - `S` is in the word but **not in position 4** (marked ""-"").

2. **From SOUTH (Guess 2):**  
   - `S` is in the word but **not in position 1** (marked ""-"").  
   - `O` and `T` are **not in the word** (both ""x"").  
   - `U` is in the word but **not in position 3** (marked ""-"").  
   - `H` is in the word but **not in position 5** (marked ""-"").

### Deductions:
- **Confirmed letters in the secret word**: `S`, `U`, `H`.  
- **Confirmed absent letters**: `R`, `A`, `I`, `E`, `O`, `T`.  
- **Position constraints**:  
  - `S` must be in **position 2 or 3** (since it is not in 1 or 4).  
  - `U` cannot be in position 3.  
  - `H` cannot be in position 5.  
- **Remaining vowel/consonant options**: The word excludes common vowels like `A`, `E`, `I`, `O`, so `U` (already confirmed) is the primary vowel. Consonants like `L`, `N`, `M`, `Y`, `P`, `B`, or `C` are candidates for testing.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- The guess must include `S`, `U`, and `H` while adhering to position constraints.  
- Place `S` in position 2 or 3 to test its correct location.  
- Place `U` and `H` in new positions (e.g., not position 3 for `U`, not position 5 for `H`).  
- Test **two new letters** to maximize information (e.g., `L` and `Y`).  
- Avoid absent letters (`R`, `A`, `I`, `E`, `O`, `T`).  

### Selected Guess: **LUSHY**
- **Why this word?**  
  - `L` (position 1): Tests a new common letter.  
  - `U` (position 2): Valid position (not position 3).  
  - `S` (position 3): Tests a new location for `S` (allowed by constraints).  
  - `H` (position 4): Valid position (not position 5).  
  - `Y` (position 5): Tests a less common letter.  
- This word respects all constraints, uses confirmed letters (`S`, `U`, `H`) in new positions, and tests two untried letters (`L` and `Y`).

Consonants like `L`, `N`, `M`, `Y`, `P`, `B`, or `C` are candidates for testing.  \n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- The guess must include `S`, `U`, and `H` while adhering to position constraints.  \n- Place `S` in position 2 or 3 to test its correct location.  \n- Place `U` and `H` in new positions (e.g., not position 3 for `U`, not position 5 for `H`).  \n- Test **two new letters** to maximize information (e.g., `L` and `Y`).  \n- Avoid absent letters (`R`, `A`, `I`, `E`, `O`, `T`).  \n\n### Selected Guess: **LUSHY**\n- **Why this word?**  \n  - `L` (position 1): Tests a new common letter.  \n  - `U` (position 2): Valid position (not position 3).  \n  - `S` (position 3): Tests a new location for `S` (allowed by constraints).  \n  - `H` (position 4): Valid position (not position 5).  \n  - `Y` (position 5): Tests a less common letter.  \n- This word respects all constraints, uses confirmed letters (`S`, `U`, `H`) in new positions, and tests two untried letters (`L` and `Y`).\n\n<guess>LUSHY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: SOUTH -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(x) U(-) T(x) H(-)\nGuess 3: LUSHY -> FEEDBACK: L(x) U(✓) S(-) H(-) Y(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE -> R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)
  - This means: S is in the word but not in position 4. R, A, I, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: SOUTH -> S(-) O(x) U(-) T(x) H(-)
  - S is in the word but not in position 1 (since we got - for S in position 1).
  - O and T are not in the word.
  - U is in the word but not in position 3 (since we placed U in position 3 and got -).
  - H is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 3: LUSHY -> L(x) U(✓) S(-) H(-) Y(x)
  - U is correct and in position 2 (since we placed U in position 2 and got ✓).
  - S is in the word but not in position 3 (we placed S in position 3 and got -).
  - H is in the word but not in position 4 (we placed H in position 4 and got -).
  - L and Y are not in the word.

Now, let's consolidate the information:

Confirmed letters in the word: S, U, H (from the - and ✓ we know they are present).

U is fixed in position 2 because we got a ✓ for U in position 2.

S is in the word but not in position 1, 3, or 4. From guess1: not in 4, guess2: not in 1, guess3: not in 3. So S must be in position 2 or 5? But wait, position 2 is already taken by U (which is fixed). Therefore, S must be in position 5? Let's see:

Positions: 1,2,3,4,5

We know:
- S cannot be in 1 (from SOUTH)
- S cannot be in 3 (from LUSHY)
- S cannot be in 4 (from RAISE)

So the only positions left are 2 and 5. But position 2 is occupied by U (which is fixed and correct). Therefore, S cannot be in position 2 because that would require two letters in the same position? No, the word has 5 distinct positions. We have U fixed at position 2, so S must be in position 5.

But wait, we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. However, in the feedback, we have not seen any indication of duplicate letters. But it's possible. However, let's see:

In the feedback for LUSHY, we have U at position 2 correct, and S at position 3 is present but wrong position. That means S is in the word but not at 3. It doesn't say anything about having two S's. But in the secret word, if S is at position 5, then in LUSHY we have S at position 3 which is wrong, but the S at position 5 is not represented in the guess LUSHY? No, LUSHY has S only at position 3. So if the secret word has S at position 5, then in LUSHY we have no S at position 5, so the feedback for S would still be that it is present (because there is an S in the word) but not at position 3. So that is consistent.

But we also have H at position 4 in LUSHY and it was marked as present but wrong position. So H is in the word but not at position 4.

Now, what about position 5? We haven't tested position 5 for S yet. But from the constraints, S must be in position 2 or 5. But position 2 is taken by U, so if the word has only one S, then S must be at 5. But what if the word has two S's? Then S could be at 2 and 5? But position 2 is U, which is fixed and correct, so if S were at position 2, then we would have two different letters at the same position? That's impossible. Therefore, the secret word cannot have S at position 2 because position 2 is U. Therefore, S must be at position 5.

So we can conclude: S is at position 5.

But wait, let me double-check:

- In guess1: RAISE had S at position 4 -> not there.
- In guess2: SOUTH had S at position 1 -> not there.
- In guess3: LUSHY had S at position 3 -> not there.

So the only position left is 5. And position 2 is taken by U, so S must be at 5.

Therefore, we have:
Position 2: U (fixed)
Position 5: S (must be)

Now, we also have H in the word. From LUSHY, H was at position 4 and we got a minus, so H is not at position 4. From SOUTH, H was at position 5 and we got a minus, but now we know position 5 is S, so that's consistent. So H must be in position 1 or 3? Because positions 2 and 5 are taken by U and S.

Positions available: 1, 3, 4.

But H cannot be at position 4 (from LUSHY feedback) and cannot be at position 5 (from SOUTH, but now we know position 5 is S). So H must be at position 1 or 3.

Similarly, we have to fill positions 1, 3, and 4 with H and two other letters? But we know H is one of them, and we have two more letters to find.

We also know the absent letters: R, A, I, E, O, T, L, Y (from the x's in the feedback). So absent letters: R, A, I, E, O, T, L, Y.

Therefore, the remaining letters must be from the alphabet excluding these.

Alphabet: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (and possibly H, but H is already known to be present, but we are considering the two other letters).

But note: we have three positions to fill (1,3,4) and we know one of them is H (but we don't know which one). So we need to find two more letters.

We also have the feedback that H is not at position 4, so H is either at 1 or 3.

Now, for the next guess, we want to try to find the position of H and the other two letters.

We know the word has the form: _ U _ _ S

And the first blank is either H or a new letter, the third blank is either H or a new letter, and the fourth blank is a new letter (since H cannot be at 4).

But we have three positions: 1, 3, 4. One of them is H (at 1 or 3) and the other two are new letters.

We can try to form a word that fits this pattern and tests possible letters.

But we have to avoid the absent letters.

Let me list the known constraints:

- Position 2: U (fixed)
- Position 5: S (fixed)
- Position 1: either H or a new letter (from the set of available letters)
- Position 3: either H or a new letter (but if H is at 1, then position 3 is a new letter, and if H is at 3, then position 1 is a new letter)
- Position 4: must be a new letter (since H cannot be at 4)

And the word must be a valid English word.

We also know that H is present and must be at 1 or 3.

Now, for the next guess, we can try to test the position of H and also test some common letters for the other positions.

But we have limited letters left to choose from. The available letters (consonants and vowels) are: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. Note that U is already used and is the only vowel we have? But we don't know if there are other vowels. The vowels we have excluded are A, E, I, O. So the only vowel left is U (which we have) and sometimes Y, but Y is excluded. So the word might not have any other vowel. It could be that the other letters are consonants.

So we are looking for a word of the form: [letter1] U [letter3] [letter4] S

With letter1 and letter3: one of them is H, the other is a consonant from the available set.

And letter4 is a consonant from the available set.

We can try to guess a word that has H in position 1, and then two new letters for 3 and 4. Or H in position 3 and new letters for 1 and 4.

But we don't know which, so we might need to test.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has H in position 1 and then common consonants for 3 and 4, and see the feedback.

But we have to make sure the word is valid.

Let me think of words that end with US and have H in the word.

Since we know the last two letters are _ S, and the second letter is U, so the last two are US. So the word ends with US.

We need a word of the form: ? U ? ? S

With H in position 1 or 3.

Possible words:

If H is at position 1: H U ? ? S

Examples: HUSKS, HUNKS, HUFFS, HUMPH (but 5 letters? HUMPH is 5 letters: H,U,M,P,H -> but H at 1 and 5, but we have S at 5? No, position 5 is S, so it must end with S, not H. So HUMPH ends with H, not S. So invalid.

HUMPS: H,U,M,P,S -> that's 5 letters: positions: H(1),U(2),M(3),P(4),S(5). This is a valid word.

Similarly, HUNKS: H,U,N,K,S.

HULLS: H,U,L,L,S -> but L is excluded (from LUSHY feedback: L(x)), so we cannot use L.

But L is excluded, so we avoid L.

Similarly, we cannot use Y, etc.

So HUMPS: uses M and P, which are available.

HUNKS: uses N and K, available.

If H is at position 3: then the word is ? U H ? S

Examples: BUHLS (not a word), MUHLS (not common), but we need valid words.

More common: SUHUS? Not a word. DUHAS? Not a word.

Perhaps: ACHUS? But A is excluded.

We need to find words that are valid and avoid excluded letters.

List of possible words:

Option 1: H at 1: 
- HUMPS (H, U, M, P, S) -> M and P are new.
- HUNKS (H, U, N, K, S) -> N and K.
- HUFFS (H, U, F, F, S) -> but F repeated? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. But we can try, but it's a valid word.

Option 2: H at 3:
- We need words like ? U H ? S
  Examples: 
  - MUCHS? Not a word.
  - BUGHS? Not a word.
  - DUMPS? D,U,M,P,S -> but H is not in this word? We need H at position 3. DUMPS has no H.
  - We need the third letter to be H.
  - Words: SUHUS? Not valid.
  - Perhaps: ACHES? But A and E excluded.
  - NUHUS? Not a word.

It seems difficult to find a word with H at position 3 and ending with US.

Another one: LUGHS? L is excluded, and it ends with HS, not S? LUGHS is L,U,G,H,S -> that's 5 letters: positions: L(1),U(2),G(3),H(4),S(5). But in this case, H is at position 4, but we know H cannot be at position 4 (from LUSHY feedback: H at position 4 was marked as present but wrong position, meaning it is not at 4). So H cannot be at 4. Therefore, we cannot have a word with H at 4.

So for H at position 3, we need a word: ? U H ? S

The fourth position must be a letter that is not H and not excluded.

Examples: 
- BUGHS: B,U,G,H,S -> but that's H at position 4? No: B(1), U(2), G(3), H(4), S(5). But H at 4 is not allowed.
- We need the third letter to be H and the fourth to be something else.

So: ? U H X S

What words are there? 
- DUCHS? Not a word.
- PUMAS? But P,U,M,A,S -> A is excluded and no H.
- Perhaps: HUHUS? Not a word.

I think it's hard to find a common word with H at position 3 and ending with US. So maybe H is more likely at position 1.

Therefore, we can try a word with H at position 1 and two new letters.

For example, HUMPS or HUNKS.

But we also have to consider that in the feedback, we have not tested many letters. We have tested: R,A,I,E,O,T,L,Y and they are absent. So we have many letters left.

But we can try HUMPS: H U M P S

This would test:
- H at position 1: if it's correct, we get a check. If not, then H must be at position 3 (and we get a minus or if absent then we have a problem, but we know H is present so we would get a minus if not at 1).
- M at position 3: if present, we get feedback.
- P at position 4: if present, we get feedback.

But note: we are also testing the letter M and P.

Alternatively, we can try to test more common letters. For example, N is more common than M and P? But both are reasonable.

Another word: HUSKS? H U S K S -> but S is repeated. We have S at position 1? No, H at 1, U at 2, S at 3, K at 4, S at 5. But we already know S is at 5, so if we put S at 3, that would be a duplicate. But we don't know if the word has two S's. However, in the feedback so far, we have not had any duplicate, but it's possible. But to avoid complexity, we might avoid duplicates for now.

In HUMPS, we don't have duplicates.

Similarly, HUNKS: H U N K S -> no duplicates.

But in HUNKS, we have K at position 4 and S at 5.

We can choose one.

But we also have the possibility that H is at position 3. If we try HUMPS and H is actually at position 3, then in HUMPS we would have H at position 1 which is wrong, so we would get a minus for H (meaning it's present but not at 1) and then we know H must be at 3. And then we would also get feedback on M and P.

So that's acceptable.

Similarly, if we try a word that has H at position 3, but as we saw, it's hard to find a common word.

Another word: what about ""PUSHY""? But we already tried LUSHY and Y is excluded, and PUSHY has P,U,S,H,Y. But Y is excluded and we know that. Also, in PUSHY, S is at position 3, which we know is not correct (from LUSHY feedback, S is not at 3). And we know position 5 is S, so PUSHY has S at 3 and no S at 5? But we have to have S at 5, so PUSHY would have S at 3 and the secret word has S at 5, so the feedback for S would be minus (because it's present but not at 3) and we already know that. But we also have H at position 4, which we know is not allowed (H cannot be at 4). So PUSHY is invalid because it places H at 4.

So not good.

Therefore, I think trying a word with H at position 1 is the way to go.

So let's choose between HUMPS and HUNKS.

HUMPS: H, U, M, P, S
HUNKS: H, U, N, K, S

Both are valid. We can choose one that uses more common letters.

N is more common than M and P? In English, N is very common.

But we are testing two letters. Let's see the frequency: N is more common than K, and M and P are both common.

But we can choose HUNKS because N is a very common letter.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests even more common letters. What about CHUMS? But C is available. CHUMS: C,H,U,M,S -> but H is at position 2? No: C(1),H(2),U(3),M(4),S(5). But we need U at position 2, so that doesn't fit.

We must have U at position 2 and S at position 5.

So the word must be: ? U ? ? S

With H at 1 or 3.

So HUNKS: H at 1, U at 2, N at 3, K at 4, S at 5.

HUMPS: H at 1, U at 2, M at 3, P at 4, S at 5.

Another word: FUMES? But E is excluded.

BUMFS? Not a word.

So I think HUNKS or HUMPS are good.

I'll go with HUNKS because it uses N and K, which are common.

But we have not tested N or K before.

So let's guess HUNKS.

But note: if H is not at position 1, then we will get a minus for H, meaning it is present but not at 1, so it must be at position 3. Then we would know that for the next guess.

Similarly, we get feedback on N and K.

So it's a good test.

Therefore, the next guess is HUNKS.

### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback history:
- **Guess 1: RAISE** → R(x), A(x), I(x), S(-), E(x)  
  - `S` is in the word but not in position 4.  
  - `R`, `A`, `I`, `E` are **absent**.  

- **Guess 2: SOUTH** → S(-), O(x), U(-), T(x), H(-)  
  - `S` is in the word but not in position 1.  
  - `U` is in the word but not in position 3.  
  - `H` is in the word but not in position 5.  
  - `O`, `T` are **absent**.  

- **Guess 3: LUSHY** → L(x), U(✓), S(-), H(-), Y(x)  
  - `U` is **correct and in position 2** (fixed).  
  - `S` is in the word but not in position 3.  
  - `H` is in the word but not in position 4.  
  - `L`, `Y` are **absent**.  

### Deductions:
- **Confirmed letters in the secret word**: `S`, `U`, `H`.  
- **Fixed positions**:  
  - Position 2: `U` (✓ from Guess 3).  
- **Position constraints for `S`**:  
  - Not in position 1 (from SOUTH), 3 (from LUSHY), or 4 (from RAISE).  
  - Only possible position left: **5** (since position 2 is occupied by `U`).  
  - **Conclusion: `S` must be in position 5**.  
- **Position constraints for `H`**:  
  - Not in position 4 (from LUSHY) or 5 (from SOUTH, now confirmed as `S`).  
  - Only possible positions: **1 or 3**.  
- **Absent letters**: `R`, `A`, `I`, `E`, `O`, `T`, `L`, `Y` (all marked ""x"").  
- **Remaining letters to test**: Consonants like `B`, `C`, `D`, `F`, `G`, `K`, `M`, `N`, `P`, `W`, etc. (vowels `A`, `E`, `I`, `O`, `Y` are excluded).  
- **Word structure**: `[H or new]` `U` `[H or new]` `[new]` `S`.  

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Test `H` in position 1 (since position 3 is the only alternative if this fails).  
- Introduce **new common consonants** for positions 3 and 4 (if `H` is at 1) or positions 1 and 4 (if `H` is at 3).  
- Prioritize high-frequency letters (`N`, `K`, `M`, `P`) to maximize information.  
- Avoid absent letters and respect fixed positions (`U` at 2, `S` at 5).  

### Selected Guess: **HUNKS**
- **Why this word?**  
  - `H` in position 1: Tests if `H` is in position 1 (if ✓, confirmed; if -, `H` must be in position 3).  
  - `U` in position 2: Fixed and correct (expected ✓).  
  - `N` in position 3: Tests a new common letter.  
  - `K` in position 4: Tests another new common letter.  
  - `S` in position 5: Fixed and correct (expected ✓).  
- **Benefits**:  
  - Uses distinct, untested letters (`N`, `K`).  
  - Resolves `H`'s position and tests high-frequency consonants.  
  - If `H` is not in position 1, feedback will confirm it must be in position 3 for the next guess.  

<guess>HUNKS</guess>",HUNKS,"We are given feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE -> R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)
  - This means: S is in the word but not in position 4. R, A, I, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: SOUTH -> S(-) O(x) U(-) T(x) H(-)
  - S is in the word but not in position 1 (since we got - for S in position 1).
  - O and T are not in the word.
  - U is in the word but not in position 3 (since we placed U in position 3 and got -).
  - H is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 3: LUSHY -> L(x) U(✓) S(-) H(-) Y(x)
  - U is correct and in position 2 (since we placed U in position 2 and got ✓).
  - S is in the word but not in position 3 (we placed S in position 3 and got -).
  - H is in the word but not in position 4 (we placed H in position 4 and got -).
  - L and Y are not in the word.

Now, let's consolidate the information:

Confirmed letters in the word: S, U, H (from the - and ✓ we know they are present).

U is fixed in position 2 because we got a ✓ for U in position 2.

S is in the word but not in position 1, 3, or 4. From guess1: not in 4, guess2: not in 1, guess3: not in 3. So S must be in position 2 or 5? But wait, position 2 is already taken by U (which is fixed). Therefore, S must be in position 5? Let's see:

Positions: 1,2,3,4,5

We know:
- S cannot be in 1 (from SOUTH)
- S cannot be in 3 (from LUSHY)
- S cannot be in 4 (from RAISE)

So the only positions left are 2 and 5. But position 2 is occupied by U (which is fixed and correct). Therefore, S cannot be in position 2 because that would require two letters in the same position? No, the word has 5 distinct positions. We have U fixed at position 2, so S must be in position 5.

But wait, we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. However, in the feedback, we have not seen any indication of duplicate letters. But it's possible. However, let's see:

In the feedback for LUSHY, we have U at position 2 correct, and S at position 3 is present but wrong position. That means S is in the word but not at 3. It doesn't say anything about having two S's. But in the secret word, if S is at position 5, then in LUSHY we have S at position 3 which is wrong, but the S at position 5 is not represented in the guess LUSHY? No, LUSHY has S only at position 3. So if the secret word has S at position 5, then in LUSHY we have no S at position 5, so the feedback for S would still be that it is present (because there is an S in the word) but not at position 3. So that is consistent.

But we also have H at position 4 in LUSHY and it was marked as present but wrong position. So H is in the word but not at position 4.

Now, what about position 5? We haven't tested position 5 for S yet. But from the constraints, S must be in position 2 or 5. But position 2 is taken by U, so if the word has only one S, then S must be at 5. But what if the word has two S's? Then S could be at 2 and 5? But position 2 is U, which is fixed and correct, so if S were at position 2, then we would have two different letters at the same position? That's impossible. Therefore, the secret word cannot have S at position 2 because position 2 is U. Therefore, S must be at position 5.

So we can conclude: S is at position 5.

But wait, let me double-check:

- In guess1: RAISE had S at position 4 -> not there.
- In guess2: SOUTH had S at position 1 -> not there.
- In guess3: LUSHY had S at position 3 -> not there.

So the only position left is 5. And position 2 is taken by U, so S must be at 5.

Therefore, we have:
Position 2: U (fixed)
Position 5: S (must be)

Now, we also have H in the word. From LUSHY, H was at position 4 and we got a minus, so H is not at position 4. From SOUTH, H was at position 5 and we got a minus, but now we know position 5 is S, so that's consistent. So H must be in position 1 or 3? Because positions 2 and 5 are taken by U and S.

Positions available: 1, 3, 4.

But H cannot be at position 4 (from LUSHY feedback) and cannot be at position 5 (from SOUTH, but now we know position 5 is S). So H must be at position 1 or 3.

Similarly, we have to fill positions 1, 3, and 4 with H and two other letters? But we know H is one of them, and we have two more letters to find.

We also know the absent letters: R, A, I, E, O, T, L, Y (from the x's in the feedback). So absent letters: R, A, I, E, O, T, L, Y.

Therefore, the remaining letters must be from the alphabet excluding these.

Alphabet: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (and possibly H, but H is already known to be present, but we are considering the two other letters).

But note: we have three positions to fill (1,3,4) and we know one of them is H (but we don't know which one). So we need to find two more letters.

We also have the feedback that H is not at position 4, so H is either at 1 or 3.

Now, for the next guess, we want to try to find the position of H and the other two letters.

We know the word has the form: _ U _ _ S

And the first blank is either H or a new letter, the third blank is either H or a new letter, and the fourth blank is a new letter (since H cannot be at 4).

But we have three positions: 1, 3, 4. One of them is H (at 1 or 3) and the other two are new letters.

We can try to form a word that fits this pattern and tests possible letters.

But we have to avoid the absent letters.

Let me list the known constraints:

- Position 2: U (fixed)
- Position 5: S (fixed)
- Position 1: either H or a new letter (from the set of available letters)
- Position 3: either H or a new letter (but if H is at 1, then position 3 is a new letter, and if H is at 3, then position 1 is a new letter)
- Position 4: must be a new letter (since H cannot be at 4)

And the word must be a valid English word.

We also know that H is present and must be at 1 or 3.

Now, for the next guess, we can try to test the position of H and also test some common letters for the other positions.

But we have limited letters left to choose from. The available letters (consonants and vowels) are: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. Note that U is already used and is the only vowel we have? But we don't know if there are other vowels. The vowels we have excluded are A, E, I, O. So the only vowel left is U (which we have) and sometimes Y, but Y is excluded. So the word might not have any other vowel. It could be that the other letters are consonants.

So we are looking for a word of the form: [letter1] U [letter3] [letter4] S

With letter1 and letter3: one of them is H, the other is a consonant from the available set.

And letter4 is a consonant from the available set.

We can try to guess a word that has H in position 1, and then two new letters for 3 and 4. Or H in position 3 and new letters for 1 and 4.

But we don't know which, so we might need to test.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has H in position 1 and then common consonants for 3 and 4, and see the feedback.

But we have to make sure the word is valid.

Let me think of words that end with US and have H in the word.

Since we know the last two letters are _ S, and the second letter is U, so the last two are US. So the word ends with US.

We need a word of the form: ? U ? ? S

With H in position 1 or 3.

Possible words:

If H is at position 1: H U ? ? S

Examples: HUSKS, HUNKS, HUFFS, HUMPH (but 5 letters? HUMPH is 5 letters: H,U,M,P,H -> but H at 1 and 5, but we have S at 5? No, position 5 is S, so it must end with S, not H. So HUMPH ends with H, not S. So invalid.

HUMPS: H,U,M,P,S -> that's 5 letters: positions: H(1),U(2),M(3),P(4),S(5). This is a valid word.

Similarly, HUNKS: H,U,N,K,S.

HULLS: H,U,L,L,S -> but L is excluded (from LUSHY feedback: L(x)), so we cannot use L.

But L is excluded, so we avoid L.

Similarly, we cannot use Y, etc.

So HUMPS: uses M and P, which are available.

HUNKS: uses N and K, available.

If H is at position 3: then the word is ? U H ? S

Examples: BUHLS (not a word), MUHLS (not common), but we need valid words.

More common: SUHUS? Not a word. DUHAS? Not a word.

Perhaps: ACHUS? But A is excluded.

We need to find words that are valid and avoid excluded letters.

List of possible words:

Option 1: H at 1: 
- HUMPS (H, U, M, P, S) -> M and P are new.
- HUNKS (H, U, N, K, S) -> N and K.
- HUFFS (H, U, F, F, S) -> but F repeated? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. But we can try, but it's a valid word.

Option 2: H at 3:
- We need words like ? U H ? S
  Examples: 
  - MUCHS? Not a word.
  - BUGHS? Not a word.
  - DUMPS? D,U,M,P,S -> but H is not in this word? We need H at position 3. DUMPS has no H.
  - We need the third letter to be H.
  - Words: SUHUS? Not valid.
  - Perhaps: ACHES? But A and E excluded.
  - NUHUS? Not a word.

It seems difficult to find a word with H at position 3 and ending with US.

Another one: LUGHS? L is excluded, and it ends with HS, not S? LUGHS is L,U,G,H,S -> that's 5 letters: positions: L(1),U(2),G(3),H(4),S(5). But in this case, H is at position 4, but we know H cannot be at position 4 (from LUSHY feedback: H at position 4 was marked as present but wrong position, meaning it is not at 4). So H cannot be at 4. Therefore, we cannot have a word with H at 4.

So for H at position 3, we need a word: ? U H ? S

The fourth position must be a letter that is not H and not excluded.

Examples: 
- BUGHS: B,U,G,H,S -> but that's H at position 4? No: B(1), U(2), G(3), H(4), S(5). But H at 4 is not allowed.
- We need the third letter to be H and the fourth to be something else.

So: ? U H X S

What words are there? 
- DUCHS? Not a word.
- PUMAS? But P,U,M,A,S -> A is excluded and no H.
- Perhaps: HUHUS? Not a word.

I think it's hard to find a common word with H at position 3 and ending with US. So maybe H is more likely at position 1.

Therefore, we can try a word with H at position 1 and two new letters.

For example, HUMPS or HUNKS.

But we also have to consider that in the feedback, we have not tested many letters. We have tested: R,A,I,E,O,T,L,Y and they are absent. So we have many letters left.

But we can try HUMPS: H U M P S

This would test:
- H at position 1: if it's correct, we get a check. If not, then H must be at position 3 (and we get a minus or if absent then we have a problem, but we know H is present so we would get a minus if not at 1).
- M at position 3: if present, we get feedback.
- P at position 4: if present, we get feedback.

But note: we are also testing the letter M and P.

Alternatively, we can try to test more common letters. For example, N is more common than M and P? But both are reasonable.

Another word: HUSKS? H U S K S -> but S is repeated. We have S at position 1? No, H at 1, U at 2, S at 3, K at 4, S at 5. But we already know S is at 5, so if we put S at 3, that would be a duplicate. But we don't know if the word has two S's. However, in the feedback so far, we have not had any duplicate, but it's possible. But to avoid complexity, we might avoid duplicates for now.

In HUMPS, we don't have duplicates.

Similarly, HUNKS: H U N K S -> no duplicates.

But in HUNKS, we have K at position 4 and S at 5.

We can choose one.

But we also have the possibility that H is at position 3. If we try HUMPS and H is actually at position 3, then in HUMPS we would have H at position 1 which is wrong, so we would get a minus for H (meaning it's present but not at 1) and then we know H must be at 3. And then we would also get feedback on M and P.

So that's acceptable.

Similarly, if we try a word that has H at position 3, but as we saw, it's hard to find a common word.

Another word: what about ""PUSHY""? But we already tried LUSHY and Y is excluded, and PUSHY has P,U,S,H,Y. But Y is excluded and we know that. Also, in PUSHY, S is at position 3, which we know is not correct (from LUSHY feedback, S is not at 3). And we know position 5 is S, so PUSHY has S at 3 and no S at 5? But we have to have S at 5, so PUSHY would have S at 3 and the secret word has S at 5, so the feedback for S would be minus (because it's present but not at 3) and we already know that. But we also have H at position 4, which we know is not allowed (H cannot be at 4). So PUSHY is invalid because it places H at 4.

So not good.

Therefore, I think trying a word with H at position 1 is the way to go.

So let's choose between HUMPS and HUNKS.

HUMPS: H, U, M, P, S
HUNKS: H, U, N, K, S

Both are valid. We can choose one that uses more common letters.

N is more common than M and P? In English, N is very common.

But we are testing two letters. Let's see the frequency: N is more common than K, and M and P are both common.

But we can choose HUNKS because N is a very common letter.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests even more common letters. What about CHUMS? But C is available. CHUMS: C,H,U,M,S -> but H is at position 2? No: C(1),H(2),U(3),M(4),S(5). But we need U at position 2, so that doesn't fit.

We must have U at position 2 and S at position 5.

So the word must be: ? U ? ? S

With H at 1 or 3.

So HUNKS: H at 1, U at 2, N at 3, K at 4, S at 5.

HUMPS: H at 1, U at 2, M at 3, P at 4, S at 5.

Another word: FUMES? But E is excluded.

BUMFS? Not a word.

So I think HUNKS or HUMPS are good.

I'll go with HUNKS because it uses N and K, which are common.

But we have not tested N or K before.

So let's guess HUNKS.

But note: if H is not at position 1, then we will get a minus for H, meaning it is present but not at 1, so it must be at position 3. Then we would know that for the next guess.

Similarly, we get feedback on N and K.

So it's a good test.

Therefore, the next guess is HUNKS.### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback history:
- **Guess 1: RAISE** → R(x), A(x), I(x), S(-), E(x)  
  - `S` is in the word but not in position 4.  
  - `R`, `A`, `I`, `E` are **absent**.  

- **Guess 2: SOUTH** → S(-), O(x), U(-), T(x), H(-)  
  - `S` is in the word but not in position 1.  
  - `U` is in the word but not in position 3.  
  - `H` is in the word but not in position 5.  
  - `O`, `T` are **absent**.  

- **Guess 3: LUSHY** → L(x), U(✓), S(-), H(-), Y(x)  
  - `U` is **correct and in position 2** (fixed).  
  - `S` is in the word but not in position 3.  
  - `H` is in the word but not in position 4.  
  - `L`, `Y` are **absent**.  

### Deductions:
- **Confirmed letters in the secret word**: `S`, `U`, `H`.  
- **Fixed positions**:  
  - Position 2: `U` (✓ from Guess 3).  
- **Position constraints for `S`**:  
  - Not in position 1 (from SOUTH), 3 (from LUSHY), or 4 (from RAISE).  
  - Only possible position left: **5** (since position 2 is occupied by `U`).  
  - **Conclusion: `S` must be in position 5**.  
- **Position constraints for `H`**:  
  - Not in position 4 (from LUSHY) or 5 (from SOUTH, now confirmed as `S`).  
  - Only possible positions: **1 or 3**.  
- **Absent letters**: `R`, `A`, `I`, `E`, `O`, `T`, `L`, `Y` (all marked ""x"").  
- **Remaining letters to test**: Consonants like `B`, `C`, `D`, `F`, `G`, `K`, `M`, `N`, `P`, `W`, etc. (vowels `A`, `E`, `I`, `O`, `Y` are excluded).  
- **Word structure**: `[H or new]` `U` `[H or new]` `[new]` `S`.  

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Test `H` in position 1 (since position 3 is the only alternative if this fails).  
- Introduce **new common consonants** for positions 3 and 4 (if `H` is at 1) or positions 1 and 4 (if `H` is at 3).  
- Prioritize high-frequency letters (`N`, `K`, `M`, `P`) to maximize information.  
- Avoid absent letters and respect fixed positions (`U` at 2, `S` at 5).  

### Selected Guess: **HUNKS**
- **Why this word?**  
  - `H` in position 1: Tests if `H` is in position 1 (if ✓, confirmed; if -, `H` must be in position 3).  
  - `U` in position 2: Fixed and correct (expected ✓).  
  - `N` in position 3: Tests a new common letter.  
  - `K` in position 4: Tests another new common letter.  
  - `S` in position 5: Fixed and correct (expected ✓).  
- **Benefits**:  
  - Uses distinct, untested letters (`N`, `K`).  
  - Resolves `H`'s position and tests high-frequency consonants.  
  - If `H` is not in position 1, feedback will confirm it must be in position 3 for the next guess.",Guess 4: HUNKS -> FEEDBACK: H(✓) U(✓) N(x) K(x) S(✓),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get. Ideally, we choose a word with 5 distinct letters that are common in 5-letter words. A common starting word is ""CRATE"" or ""SLATE"" or ""ROATE"". Another popular starting word is ""RAISE"". Let's choose ""RAISE"" because it has common letters: R, A, I, S, E.

Guess: RAISEFor the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that maximizes information gain by using common letters and avoiding duplicates. The word ""RAISE"" is a strong starter because it contains five distinct letters: R, A, I, S, and E. These letters are among the most frequent in English 5-letter words, increasing the likelihood of revealing correct positions or existing letters in the secret word. If any letters match (with ✓ or -), future guesses can build on this information efficiently. If none appear (all x), that still significantly narrows possibilities.

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The letter S is in the secret word, but not in the 4th position (since in RAISE, S is the 4th letter and we got a '-' meaning it's present but misplaced).
- The letters R, A, I, E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains S and it must be in one of the positions: 1, 2, 3, or 5 (since it's not in position 4). But note that in the feedback, S was in position 4 and was marked as present but wrong position, so S is definitely in the word, just not at position 4.

We also know that the secret word does not contain R, A, I, or E.

For the next guess, we need to choose a 5-letter word that:
- Includes the letter S (since we know it's in the word) but not in the 4th position (because we already tried that and it was wrong).
- Avoids the letters R, A, I, E (since they are not in the word).
- We want to test other common letters to get more information.

We have 6 tries, so we can use this guess to narrow down the position of S and also test new letters.

Possible positions for S: 1, 2, 3, 5.

We should also try to include other common consonants and vowels that we haven't tried. Since we know the word has S, and we have eliminated R, A, I, E, the remaining vowels are O, U and sometimes Y. Consonants we haven't tried include T, N, L, C, D, H, etc.

A good strategy is to pick a word that has S in a different position and uses new letters to cover more ground.

Let's think of words that have S and avoid R, A, I, E.

For example, we can try S in the first position: words like ""SOUTH"", ""SONIC"", ""SOLID"", etc.

But note: we also want to test other common letters. Since we have only one confirmed letter (S) and four new positions to test, we should choose a word with as many new common letters as possible.

Alternatively, we can try S in the second position: words like ""USUAL"" (but U is repeated and we have A which is eliminated? Wait, A is eliminated so we cannot use A). We must avoid A.

Let me list some candidate words:

- S in position 1: 
  - S with O: ""SOLAR"" (but has A and R, which are eliminated) -> invalid.
  - ""SONLY"" (not a word) 
  - ""SONGS"" (has S repeated, and we don't know if S is repeated, but it's acceptable; however, we are avoiding A, R, I, E, so this is okay? But S is repeated and we don't know if the word has two S's. Also, we are trying to get new letters. ""SONGS"" has O, N, G, S. But S is at position 1 and 5. We know S is in the word, but we don't know if it's repeated. We can try, but maybe not the best because we are repeating S and we might not get information about other letters.

We want to use distinct letters if possible to maximize information.

So, let's try to find a word with S in position 1 and four new distinct letters that are not R, A, I, E.

Possible words: 
- ""SOUTH"" -> S, O, U, T, H. All distinct and new. This is a good candidate.
- ""SHOWN"" -> S, H, O, W, N. Also good.
- ""SLUNG"" -> S, L, U, N, G. Good.

But note: we have eliminated E, so we don't have to worry about that.

Alternatively, S in position 2: 
- Words like ""USHER"" (has E and R, eliminated) -> invalid.
- ""PSYCH"" (not 5 letters? ""PSYCH"" is not a word, but ""PSYCH"" is a root, not a word. We need valid words.)
- ""MUSTY"" -> M, U, S, T, Y. S is in position 3? Let's see: M (1), U (2), S (3), T (4), Y (5). So if we put S in position 3, that's a new position. But we want to test S in a position we haven't tried? We only tried position 4 so far. So positions 1,2,3,5 are available.

We can try S in position 3? But in the first guess, we had S in position 4 and it was misplaced. So we know S is in the word but not at position 4. We can try any of 1,2,3,5.

But to maximize information, we might want to try a position that is common for S, such as the beginning or the end.

Another candidate: S in position 5: 
- Words like ""FOCUS"" -> F, O, C, U, S. S at the end. This is good because we test S at position 5 and new letters.

But note: we also want to cover more common letters. The most common consonants in English are T, N, S, L, R (but R is eliminated), so T, N, L are good to test.

Also, vowels: we have only tested A, I, E and they are out. So we should test O and U.

Therefore, a word that includes S (not in position 4) and also includes T, N, L, O, U, etc.

Let me think of a word that has S and T, for example.

One classic second guess after getting one letter is to try a word that places the known letter in a different position and uses new common letters.

I think ""SOUTH"" is a strong candidate: 
- S at position 1 (new position)
- O, U, T, H: all new and common.

Another candidate: ""SHUNT"" -> S, H, U, N, T. S at position 1, and we test H, U, N, T.

But ""SOUTH"" is more common.

Alternatively, ""STOMP"" -> S, T, O, M, P. But we have S at 1 and T at 2.

But we don't know if the word has T or not.

We can also consider ""LUSTY"" -> L, U, S, T, Y. S at position 3. This tests L, U, S (at 3), T, Y.

But we are testing S at position 3, which is a new position.

I think ""SOUTH"" is a good choice because:
- It places S at position 1 (we haven't tried S at 1)
- It tests O, U, T, H which are common and we haven't tried them.

So, let's go with ""SOUTH"".

But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""SOUTH"" is a valid English word.

Therefore, the next guess is ""SOUTH"".

We'll see if S is at position 1 (if we get a check) or if it's elsewhere (if we get a minus). Also, we'll get information about O, U, T, H.

If S is not at position 1, we might get a minus for S, meaning it's in the word but not at 1, and then we know it must be at 2,3, or 5 (since 4 is already tried and we know it's not there).

But we are trying position 1 now.

So, I think ""SOUTH"" is a good second guess.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, A, I, E are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- S is in the secret word but **not in the 4th position** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- The word must include **S** (since it's confirmed in the secret word) but avoid placing it in the 4th position again.
- It should exclude R, A, I, E (as they are absent from the secret word).
- To maximize information, the guess should test new common letters (e.g., O, U, T, H, N, L) and position S in a new location (e.g., position 1, 2, 3, or 5).

A strong candidate is **""SOUTH""**:
- Places S in position 1 (a new position to test).
- Introduces new common letters: O, U, T, H.
- Avoids R, A, I, E and uses distinct letters for efficient feedback.

<guess>SOUTH</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SOUTH -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(x) U(-) T(x) H(-)
<｜Assistant｜>Alright, let me figure this out step by step. From the first guess ""RAISE"", we know that S is in the word but not in the fourth position, and R, A, I, E are definitely not in the word. 

Now looking at the second guess ""SOUTH"":
- S(-) means S is still in the word but not in the first position (since we placed it there)
- O(x) is new information - O is not in the word at all
- U(-) means U is in the word but not in the third position
- T(x) means T is not in the word
- H(-) means H is in the word but not in the fifth position

So combining everything we know:
Confirmed in word: S, U, H
Confirmed not in word: R, A, I, E, O, T
Position constraints:
- S cannot be in pos 1 or 4
- U cannot be in pos 3
- H cannot be in pos 5

Possible positions left for S: 2 or 3
For U: 1,2,4,5
For H: 1,2,3,4

Now we need a word that:
1. Contains S (in pos 2 or 3), U and H
2. Avoids R,A,I,E,O,T
3. Has two new letters to test

Considering letter frequency, good candidates might be consonants like N, L, M or vowel Y. Since three letters are already confirmed, we can use the remaining positions to test new letters.

Possible words come to mind:
""SHULY"" - but not a valid word
""PUSHY"" - has P,Y and positions S(3),U(2),H(5). Checking positions:
- S is in pos 3? Could work
- U in pos 2? Possible
- H in pos 5? But H cannot be in pos 5 as per feedback (H(-) in SOUTH means H is not in pos 5)

I need to mind the position constraints. H cannot be in pos 5, U cannot be in pos 3, S cannot be in pos 1 or 4.

Another idea: ""BUSHW"" - not valid
""LUSHY"" - valid word: L U S H Y
Breakdown:
- Pos2 U - U can be here? Feedback said U was not in pos 3, but pos2 is okay
- Pos3 S - S can be in pos3 (since not 1 or 4)
- Pos4 H - H can be in pos4 (since not 5)
- Pos1 L (new letter)
- Pos5 Y (new letter)

Constraints satisfied:
- S is in pos3 (allowed)
- U in pos2 (not pos3, good)
- H in pos4 (not pos5, good)
No R,A,I,E,O,T used

This looks promising. Another option could be ""MUSHY"" but contains M instead of L.

Both test two new consonants. Since L is slightly more common than M, ""LUSHY"" might be slightly better for information gain. Also ""Y"" at the end might be less common but worth including.

So ""LUSHY"" seems like a strong candidate - it places all known letters in new valid positions and tests L and Y for the remaining spots.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

### Key Information from Feedback:
1. **From RAISE (Guess 1):**  
   - `R`, `A`, `I`, `E` are **not in the word** (all ""x"").  
   - `S` is in the word but **not in position 4** (marked ""-"").

2. **From SOUTH (Guess 2):**  
   - `S` is in the word but **not in position 1** (marked ""-"").  
   - `O` and `T` are **not in the word** (both ""x"").  
   - `U` is in the word but **not in position 3** (marked ""-"").  
   - `H` is in the word but **not in position 5** (marked ""-"").

### Deductions:
- **Confirmed letters in the secret word**: `S`, `U`, `H`.  
- **Confirmed absent letters**: `R`, `A`, `I`, `E`, `O`, `T`.  
- **Position constraints**:  
  - `S` must be in **position 2 or 3** (since it is not in 1 or 4).  
  - `U` cannot be in position 3.  
  - `H` cannot be in position 5.  
- **Remaining vowel/consonant options**: The word excludes common vowels like `A`, `E`, `I`, `O`, so `U` (already confirmed) is the primary vowel. Consonants like `L`, `N`, `M`, `Y`, `P`, `B`, or `C` are candidates for testing.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- The guess must include `S`, `U`, and `H` while adhering to position constraints.  
- Place `S` in position 2 or 3 to test its correct location.  
- Place `U` and `H` in new positions (e.g., not position 3 for `U`, not position 5 for `H`).  
- Test **two new letters** to maximize information (e.g., `L` and `Y`).  
- Avoid absent letters (`R`, `A`, `I`, `E`, `O`, `T`).  

### Selected Guess: **LUSHY**
- **Why this word?**  
  - `L` (position 1): Tests a new common letter.  
  - `U` (position 2): Valid position (not position 3).  
  - `S` (position 3): Tests a new location for `S` (allowed by constraints).  
  - `H` (position 4): Valid position (not position 5).  
  - `Y` (position 5): Tests a less common letter.  
- This word respects all constraints, uses confirmed letters (`S`, `U`, `H`) in new positions, and tests two untried letters (`L` and `Y`).

<guess>LUSHY</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SOUTH -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(x) U(-) T(x) H(-)
Guess 3: LUSHY -> FEEDBACK: L(x) U(✓) S(-) H(-) Y(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE -> R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)
  - This means: S is in the word but not in position 4. R, A, I, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: SOUTH -> S(-) O(x) U(-) T(x) H(-)
  - S is in the word but not in position 1 (since we got - for S in position 1).
  - O and T are not in the word.
  - U is in the word but not in position 3 (since we placed U in position 3 and got -).
  - H is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 3: LUSHY -> L(x) U(✓) S(-) H(-) Y(x)
  - U is correct and in position 2 (since we placed U in position 2 and got ✓).
  - S is in the word but not in position 3 (we placed S in position 3 and got -).
  - H is in the word but not in position 4 (we placed H in position 4 and got -).
  - L and Y are not in the word.

Now, let's consolidate the information:

Confirmed letters in the word: S, U, H (from the - and ✓ we know they are present).

U is fixed in position 2 because we got a ✓ for U in position 2.

S is in the word but not in position 1, 3, or 4. From guess1: not in 4, guess2: not in 1, guess3: not in 3. So S must be in position 2 or 5? But wait, position 2 is already taken by U (which is fixed). Therefore, S must be in position 5? Let's see:

Positions: 1,2,3,4,5

We know:
- S cannot be in 1 (from SOUTH)
- S cannot be in 3 (from LUSHY)
- S cannot be in 4 (from RAISE)

So the only positions left are 2 and 5. But position 2 is occupied by U (which is fixed and correct). Therefore, S cannot be in position 2 because that would require two letters in the same position? No, the word has 5 distinct positions. We have U fixed at position 2, so S must be in position 5.

But wait, we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. However, in the feedback, we have not seen any indication of duplicate letters. But it's possible. However, let's see:

In the feedback for LUSHY, we have U at position 2 correct, and S at position 3 is present but wrong position. That means S is in the word but not at 3. It doesn't say anything about having two S's. But in the secret word, if S is at position 5, then in LUSHY we have S at position 3 which is wrong, but the S at position 5 is not represented in the guess LUSHY? No, LUSHY has S only at position 3. So if the secret word has S at position 5, then in LUSHY we have no S at position 5, so the feedback for S would still be that it is present (because there is an S in the word) but not at position 3. So that is consistent.

But we also have H at position 4 in LUSHY and it was marked as present but wrong position. So H is in the word but not at position 4.

Now, what about position 5? We haven't tested position 5 for S yet. But from the constraints, S must be in position 2 or 5. But position 2 is taken by U, so if the word has only one S, then S must be at 5. But what if the word has two S's? Then S could be at 2 and 5? But position 2 is U, which is fixed and correct, so if S were at position 2, then we would have two different letters at the same position? That's impossible. Therefore, the secret word cannot have S at position 2 because position 2 is U. Therefore, S must be at position 5.

So we can conclude: S is at position 5.

But wait, let me double-check:

- In guess1: RAISE had S at position 4 -> not there.
- In guess2: SOUTH had S at position 1 -> not there.
- In guess3: LUSHY had S at position 3 -> not there.

So the only position left is 5. And position 2 is taken by U, so S must be at 5.

Therefore, we have:
Position 2: U (fixed)
Position 5: S (must be)

Now, we also have H in the word. From LUSHY, H was at position 4 and we got a minus, so H is not at position 4. From SOUTH, H was at position 5 and we got a minus, but now we know position 5 is S, so that's consistent. So H must be in position 1 or 3? Because positions 2 and 5 are taken by U and S.

Positions available: 1, 3, 4.

But H cannot be at position 4 (from LUSHY feedback) and cannot be at position 5 (from SOUTH, but now we know position 5 is S). So H must be at position 1 or 3.

Similarly, we have to fill positions 1, 3, and 4 with H and two other letters? But we know H is one of them, and we have two more letters to find.

We also know the absent letters: R, A, I, E, O, T, L, Y (from the x's in the feedback). So absent letters: R, A, I, E, O, T, L, Y.

Therefore, the remaining letters must be from the alphabet excluding these.

Alphabet: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (and possibly H, but H is already known to be present, but we are considering the two other letters).

But note: we have three positions to fill (1,3,4) and we know one of them is H (but we don't know which one). So we need to find two more letters.

We also have the feedback that H is not at position 4, so H is either at 1 or 3.

Now, for the next guess, we want to try to find the position of H and the other two letters.

We know the word has the form: _ U _ _ S

And the first blank is either H or a new letter, the third blank is either H or a new letter, and the fourth blank is a new letter (since H cannot be at 4).

But we have three positions: 1, 3, 4. One of them is H (at 1 or 3) and the other two are new letters.

We can try to form a word that fits this pattern and tests possible letters.

But we have to avoid the absent letters.

Let me list the known constraints:

- Position 2: U (fixed)
- Position 5: S (fixed)
- Position 1: either H or a new letter (from the set of available letters)
- Position 3: either H or a new letter (but if H is at 1, then position 3 is a new letter, and if H is at 3, then position 1 is a new letter)
- Position 4: must be a new letter (since H cannot be at 4)

And the word must be a valid English word.

We also know that H is present and must be at 1 or 3.

Now, for the next guess, we can try to test the position of H and also test some common letters for the other positions.

But we have limited letters left to choose from. The available letters (consonants and vowels) are: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. Note that U is already used and is the only vowel we have? But we don't know if there are other vowels. The vowels we have excluded are A, E, I, O. So the only vowel left is U (which we have) and sometimes Y, but Y is excluded. So the word might not have any other vowel. It could be that the other letters are consonants.

So we are looking for a word of the form: [letter1] U [letter3] [letter4] S

With letter1 and letter3: one of them is H, the other is a consonant from the available set.

And letter4 is a consonant from the available set.

We can try to guess a word that has H in position 1, and then two new letters for 3 and 4. Or H in position 3 and new letters for 1 and 4.

But we don't know which, so we might need to test.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has H in position 1 and then common consonants for 3 and 4, and see the feedback.

But we have to make sure the word is valid.

Let me think of words that end with US and have H in the word.

Since we know the last two letters are _ S, and the second letter is U, so the last two are US. So the word ends with US.

We need a word of the form: ? U ? ? S

With H in position 1 or 3.

Possible words:

If H is at position 1: H U ? ? S

Examples: HUSKS, HUNKS, HUFFS, HUMPH (but 5 letters? HUMPH is 5 letters: H,U,M,P,H -> but H at 1 and 5, but we have S at 5? No, position 5 is S, so it must end with S, not H. So HUMPH ends with H, not S. So invalid.

HUMPS: H,U,M,P,S -> that's 5 letters: positions: H(1),U(2),M(3),P(4),S(5). This is a valid word.

Similarly, HUNKS: H,U,N,K,S.

HULLS: H,U,L,L,S -> but L is excluded (from LUSHY feedback: L(x)), so we cannot use L.

But L is excluded, so we avoid L.

Similarly, we cannot use Y, etc.

So HUMPS: uses M and P, which are available.

HUNKS: uses N and K, available.

If H is at position 3: then the word is ? U H ? S

Examples: BUHLS (not a word), MUHLS (not common), but we need valid words.

More common: SUHUS? Not a word. DUHAS? Not a word.

Perhaps: ACHUS? But A is excluded.

We need to find words that are valid and avoid excluded letters.

List of possible words:

Option 1: H at 1: 
- HUMPS (H, U, M, P, S) -> M and P are new.
- HUNKS (H, U, N, K, S) -> N and K.
- HUFFS (H, U, F, F, S) -> but F repeated? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. But we can try, but it's a valid word.

Option 2: H at 3:
- We need words like ? U H ? S
  Examples: 
  - MUCHS? Not a word.
  - BUGHS? Not a word.
  - DUMPS? D,U,M,P,S -> but H is not in this word? We need H at position 3. DUMPS has no H.
  - We need the third letter to be H.
  - Words: SUHUS? Not valid.
  - Perhaps: ACHES? But A and E excluded.
  - NUHUS? Not a word.

It seems difficult to find a word with H at position 3 and ending with US.

Another one: LUGHS? L is excluded, and it ends with HS, not S? LUGHS is L,U,G,H,S -> that's 5 letters: positions: L(1),U(2),G(3),H(4),S(5). But in this case, H is at position 4, but we know H cannot be at position 4 (from LUSHY feedback: H at position 4 was marked as present but wrong position, meaning it is not at 4). So H cannot be at 4. Therefore, we cannot have a word with H at 4.

So for H at position 3, we need a word: ? U H ? S

The fourth position must be a letter that is not H and not excluded.

Examples: 
- BUGHS: B,U,G,H,S -> but that's H at position 4? No: B(1), U(2), G(3), H(4), S(5). But H at 4 is not allowed.
- We need the third letter to be H and the fourth to be something else.

So: ? U H X S

What words are there? 
- DUCHS? Not a word.
- PUMAS? But P,U,M,A,S -> A is excluded and no H.
- Perhaps: HUHUS? Not a word.

I think it's hard to find a common word with H at position 3 and ending with US. So maybe H is more likely at position 1.

Therefore, we can try a word with H at position 1 and two new letters.

For example, HUMPS or HUNKS.

But we also have to consider that in the feedback, we have not tested many letters. We have tested: R,A,I,E,O,T,L,Y and they are absent. So we have many letters left.

But we can try HUMPS: H U M P S

This would test:
- H at position 1: if it's correct, we get a check. If not, then H must be at position 3 (and we get a minus or if absent then we have a problem, but we know H is present so we would get a minus if not at 1).
- M at position 3: if present, we get feedback.
- P at position 4: if present, we get feedback.

But note: we are also testing the letter M and P.

Alternatively, we can try to test more common letters. For example, N is more common than M and P? But both are reasonable.

Another word: HUSKS? H U S K S -> but S is repeated. We have S at position 1? No, H at 1, U at 2, S at 3, K at 4, S at 5. But we already know S is at 5, so if we put S at 3, that would be a duplicate. But we don't know if the word has two S's. However, in the feedback so far, we have not had any duplicate, but it's possible. But to avoid complexity, we might avoid duplicates for now.

In HUMPS, we don't have duplicates.

Similarly, HUNKS: H U N K S -> no duplicates.

But in HUNKS, we have K at position 4 and S at 5.

We can choose one.

But we also have the possibility that H is at position 3. If we try HUMPS and H is actually at position 3, then in HUMPS we would have H at position 1 which is wrong, so we would get a minus for H (meaning it's present but not at 1) and then we know H must be at 3. And then we would also get feedback on M and P.

So that's acceptable.

Similarly, if we try a word that has H at position 3, but as we saw, it's hard to find a common word.

Another word: what about ""PUSHY""? But we already tried LUSHY and Y is excluded, and PUSHY has P,U,S,H,Y. But Y is excluded and we know that. Also, in PUSHY, S is at position 3, which we know is not correct (from LUSHY feedback, S is not at 3). And we know position 5 is S, so PUSHY has S at 3 and no S at 5? But we have to have S at 5, so PUSHY would have S at 3 and the secret word has S at 5, so the feedback for S would be minus (because it's present but not at 3) and we already know that. But we also have H at position 4, which we know is not allowed (H cannot be at 4). So PUSHY is invalid because it places H at 4.

So not good.

Therefore, I think trying a word with H at position 1 is the way to go.

So let's choose between HUMPS and HUNKS.

HUMPS: H, U, M, P, S
HUNKS: H, U, N, K, S

Both are valid. We can choose one that uses more common letters.

N is more common than M and P? In English, N is very common.

But we are testing two letters. Let's see the frequency: N is more common than K, and M and P are both common.

But we can choose HUNKS because N is a very common letter.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests even more common letters. What about CHUMS? But C is available. CHUMS: C,H,U,M,S -> but H is at position 2? No: C(1),H(2),U(3),M(4),S(5). But we need U at position 2, so that doesn't fit.

We must have U at position 2 and S at position 5.

So the word must be: ? U ? ? S

With H at 1 or 3.

So HUNKS: H at 1, U at 2, N at 3, K at 4, S at 5.

HUMPS: H at 1, U at 2, M at 3, P at 4, S at 5.

Another word: FUMES? But E is excluded.

BUMFS? Not a word.

So I think HUNKS or HUMPS are good.

I'll go with HUNKS because it uses N and K, which are common.

But we have not tested N or K before.

So let's guess HUNKS.

But note: if H is not at position 1, then we will get a minus for H, meaning it is present but not at 1, so it must be at position 3. Then we would know that for the next guess.

Similarly, we get feedback on N and K.

So it's a good test.

Therefore, the next guess is HUNKS.### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback history:
- **Guess 1: RAISE** → R(x), A(x), I(x), S(-), E(x)  
  - `S` is in the word but not in position 4.  
  - `R`, `A`, `I`, `E` are **absent**.  

- **Guess 2: SOUTH** → S(-), O(x), U(-), T(x), H(-)  
  - `S` is in the word but not in position 1.  
  - `U` is in the word but not in position 3.  
  - `H` is in the word but not in position 5.  
  - `O`, `T` are **absent**.  

- **Guess 3: LUSHY** → L(x), U(✓), S(-), H(-), Y(x)  
  - `U` is **correct and in position 2** (fixed).  
  - `S` is in the word but not in position 3.  
  - `H` is in the word but not in position 4.  
  - `L`, `Y` are **absent**.  

### Deductions:
- **Confirmed letters in the secret word**: `S`, `U`, `H`.  
- **Fixed positions**:  
  - Position 2: `U` (✓ from Guess 3).  
- **Position constraints for `S`**:  
  - Not in position 1 (from SOUTH), 3 (from LUSHY), or 4 (from RAISE).  
  - Only possible position left: **5** (since position 2 is occupied by `U`).  
  - **Conclusion: `S` must be in position 5**.  
- **Position constraints for `H`**:  
  - Not in position 4 (from LUSHY) or 5 (from SOUTH, now confirmed as `S`).  
  - Only possible positions: **1 or 3**.  
- **Absent letters**: `R`, `A`, `I`, `E`, `O`, `T`, `L`, `Y` (all marked ""x"").  
- **Remaining letters to test**: Consonants like `B`, `C`, `D`, `F`, `G`, `K`, `M`, `N`, `P`, `W`, etc. (vowels `A`, `E`, `I`, `O`, `Y` are excluded).  
- **Word structure**: `[H or new]` `U` `[H or new]` `[new]` `S`.  

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Test `H` in position 1 (since position 3 is the only alternative if this fails).  
- Introduce **new common consonants** for positions 3 and 4 (if `H` is at 1) or positions 1 and 4 (if `H` is at 3).  
- Prioritize high-frequency letters (`N`, `K`, `M`, `P`) to maximize information.  
- Avoid absent letters and respect fixed positions (`U` at 2, `S` at 5).  

### Selected Guess: **HUNKS**
- **Why this word?**  
  - `H` in position 1: Tests if `H` is in position 1 (if ✓, confirmed; if -, `H` must be in position 3).  
  - `U` in position 2: Fixed and correct (expected ✓).  
  - `N` in position 3: Tests a new common letter.  
  - `K` in position 4: Tests another new common letter.  
  - `S` in position 5: Fixed and correct (expected ✓).  
- **Benefits**:  
  - Uses distinct, untested letters (`N`, `K`).  
  - Resolves `H`'s position and tests high-frequency consonants.  
  - If `H` is not in position 1, feedback will confirm it must be in position 3 for the next guess.

Consonants we haven\'t tried include T, N, L, C, D, H, etc.\n\nA good strategy is to pick a word that has S in a different position and uses new letters to cover more ground.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have S and avoid R, A, I, E.\n\nFor example, we can try S in the first position: words like ""SOUTH"", ""SONIC"", ""SOLID"", etc.\n\nBut note: we also want to test other common letters. Since we have only one confirmed letter (S) and four new positions to test, we should choose a word with as many new common letters as possible.\n\nAlternatively, we can try S in the second position: words like ""USUAL"" (but U is repeated and we have A which is eliminated? Wait, A is eliminated so we cannot use A). We must avoid A.\n\nLet me list some candidate words:\n\n- S in position 1: \n  - S with O: ""SOLAR"" (but has A and R, which are eliminated) -> invalid.\n  - ""SONLY"" (not a word) \n  - ""SONGS"" (has S repeated, and we don\'t know if S is repeated, but it\'s acceptable; however, we are avoiding A, R, I, E, so this is okay? But S is repeated and we don\'t know if the word has two S\'s. Also, we are trying to get new letters. ""SONGS"" has O, N, G, S. But S is at position 1 and 5. We know S is in the word, but we don\'t know if it\'s repeated. We can try, but maybe not the best because we are repeating S and we might not get information about other letters.\n\nWe want to use distinct letters if possible to maximize information.\n\nSo, let\'s try to find a word with S in position 1 and four new distinct letters that are not R, A, I, E.\n\nPossible words: \n- ""SOUTH"" -> S, O, U, T, H. All distinct and new. This is a good candidate.\n- ""SHOWN"" -> S, H, O, W, N. Also good.\n- ""SLUNG"" -> S, L, U, N, G. Good.\n\nBut note: we have eliminated E, so we don\'t have to worry about that.\n\nAlternatively, S in position 2: \n- Words like ""USHER"" (has E and R, eliminated) -> invalid.\n- ""PSYCH"" (not 5 letters? ""PSYCH"" is not a word, but ""PSYCH"" is a root, not a word. We need valid words.)\n- ""MUSTY"" -> M, U, S, T, Y. S is in position 3? Let\'s see: M (1), U (2), S (3), T (4), Y (5). So if we put S in position 3, that\'s a new position. But we want to test S in a position we haven\'t tried? We only tried position 4 so far. So positions 1,2,3,5 are available.\n\nWe can try S in position 3? But in the first guess, we had S in position 4 and it was misplaced. So we know S is in the word but not at position 4. We can try any of 1,2,3,5.\n\nBut to maximize information, we might want to try a position that is common for S, such as the beginning or the end.\n\nAnother candidate: S in position 5: \n- Words like ""FOCUS"" -> F, O, C, U, S. S at the end. This is good because we test S at position 5 and new letters.\n\nBut note: we also want to cover more common letters. The most common consonants in English are T, N, S, L, R (but R is eliminated), so T, N, L are good to test.\n\nAlso, vowels: we have only tested A, I, E and they are out. So we should test O and U.\n\nTherefore, a word that includes S (not in position 4) and also includes T, N, L, O, U, etc.\n\nLet me think of a word that has S and T, for example.\n\nOne classic second guess after getting one letter is to try a word that places the known letter in a different position and uses new common letters.\n\nI think ""SOUTH"" is a strong candidate: \n- S at position 1 (new position)\n- O, U, T, H: all new and common.\n\nAnother candidate: ""SHUNT"" -> S, H, U, N, T. S at position 1, and we test H, U, N, T.\n\nBut ""SOUTH"" is more common.\n\nAlternatively, ""STOMP"" -> S, T, O, M, P. But we have S at 1 and T at 2.\n\nBut we don\'t know if the word has T or not.\n\nWe can also consider ""LUSTY"" -> L, U, S, T, Y. S at position 3. This tests L, U, S (at 3), T, Y.\n\nBut we are testing S at position 3, which is a new position.\n\nI think ""SOUTH"" is a good choice because:\n- It places S at position 1 (we haven\'t tried S at 1)\n- It tests O, U, T, H which are common and we haven\'t tried them.\n\nSo, let\'s go with ""SOUTH"".\n\nBut note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""SOUTH"" is a valid English word.\n\nTherefore, the next guess is ""SOUTH"".\n\nWe\'ll see if S is at position 1 (if we get a check) or if it\'s elsewhere (if we get a minus). Also, we\'ll get information about O, U, T, H.\n\nIf S is not at position 1, we might get a minus for S, meaning it\'s in the word but not at 1, and then we know it must be at 2,3, or 5 (since 4 is already tried and we know it\'s not there).\n\nBut we are trying position 1 now.\n\nSo, I think ""SOUTH"" is a good second guess.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R, A, I, E are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- S is in the secret word but **not in the 4th position** (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- The word must include **S** (since it\'s confirmed in the secret word) but avoid placing it in the 4th position again.\n- It should exclude R, A, I, E (as they are absent from the secret word).\n- To maximize information, the guess should test new common letters (e.g., O, U, T, H, N, L) and position S in a new location (e.g., position 1, 2, 3, or 5).\n\nA strong candidate is **""SOUTH""**:\n- Places S in position 1 (a new position to test).\n- Introduces new common letters: O, U, T, H.\n- Avoids R, A, I, E and uses distinct letters for efficient feedback.\n\n<guess>SOUTH</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: SOUTH -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(x) U(-) T(x) H(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Alright, let me figure this out step by step. From the first guess ""RAISE"", we know that S is in the word but not in the fourth position, and R, A, I, E are definitely not in the word. \n\nNow looking at the second guess ""SOUTH"":\n- S(-) means S is still in the word but not in the first position (since we placed it there)\n- O(x) is new information - O is not in the word at all\n- U(-) means U is in the word but not in the third position\n- T(x) means T is not in the word\n- H(-) means H is in the word but not in the fifth position\n\nSo combining everything we know:\nConfirmed in word: S, U, H\nConfirmed not in word: R, A, I, E, O, T\nPosition constraints:\n- S cannot be in pos 1 or 4\n- U cannot be in pos 3\n- H cannot be in pos 5\n\nPossible positions left for S: 2 or 3\nFor U: 1,2,4,5\nFor H: 1,2,3,4\n\nNow we need a word that:\n1. Contains S (in pos 2 or 3), U and H\n2. Avoids R,A,I,E,O,T\n3. Has two new letters to test\n\nConsidering letter frequency, good candidates might be consonants like N, L, M or vowel Y. Since three letters are already confirmed, we can use the remaining positions to test new letters.\n\nPossible words come to mind:\n""SHULY"" - but not a valid word\n""PUSHY"" - has P,Y and positions S(3),U(2),H(5). Checking positions:\n- S is in pos 3? Could work\n- U in pos 2? Possible\n- H in pos 5? But H cannot be in pos 5 as per feedback (H(-) in SOUTH means H is not in pos 5)\n\nI need to mind the position constraints. H cannot be in pos 5, U cannot be in pos 3, S cannot be in pos 1 or 4.\n\nAnother idea: ""BUSHW"" - not valid\n""LUSHY"" - valid word: L U S H Y\nBreakdown:\n- Pos2 U - U can be here? Feedback said U was not in pos 3, but pos2 is okay\n- Pos3 S - S can be in pos3 (since not 1 or 4)\n- Pos4 H - H can be in pos4 (since not 5)\n- Pos1 L (new letter)\n- Pos5 Y (new letter)\n\nConstraints satisfied:\n- S is in pos3 (allowed)\n- U in pos2 (not pos3, good)\n- H in pos4 (not pos5, good)\nNo R,A,I,E,O,T used\n\nThis looks promising. Another option could be ""MUSHY"" but contains M instead of L.\n\nBoth test two new consonants. Since L is slightly more common than M, ""LUSHY"" might be slightly better for information gain. Also ""Y"" at the end might be less common but worth including.\n\nSo ""LUSHY"" seems like a strong candidate - it places all known letters in new valid positions and tests L and Y for the remaining spots.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n### Key Information from Feedback:\n1. **From RAISE (Guess 1):**  \n   - `R`, `A`, `I`, `E` are **not in the word** (all ""x"").  \n   - `S` is in the word but **not in position 4** (marked ""-"").\n\n2. **From SOUTH (Guess 2):**  \n   - `S` is in the word but **not in position 1** (marked ""-"").  \n   - `O` and `T` are **not in the word** (both ""x"").  \n   - `U` is in the word but **not in position 3** (marked ""-"").  \n   - `H` is in the word but **not in position 5** (marked ""-"").\n\n### Deductions:\n- **Confirmed letters in the secret word**: `S`, `U`, `H`.  \n- **Confirmed absent letters**: `R`, `A`, `I`, `E`, `O`, `T`.  \n- **Position constraints**:  \n  - `S` must be in **position 2 or 3** (since it is not in 1 or 4).  \n  - `U` cannot be in position 3.  \n  - `H` cannot be in position 5.  \n- **Remaining vowel/consonant options**: The word excludes common vowels like `A`, `E`, `I`, `O`, so `U` (already confirmed) is the primary vowel. Consonants like `L`, `N`, `M`, `Y`, `P`, `B`, or `C` are candidates for testing.  \n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- The guess must include `S`, `U`, and `H` while adhering to position constraints.  \n- Place `S` in position 2 or 3 to test its correct location.  \n- Place `U` and `H` in new positions (e.g., not position 3 for `U`, not position 5 for `H`).  \n- Test **two new letters** to maximize information (e.g., `L` and `Y`).  \n- Avoid absent letters (`R`, `A`, `I`, `E`, `O`, `T`).  \n\n### Selected Guess: **LUSHY**\n- **Why this word?**  \n  - `L` (position 1): Tests a new common letter.  \n  - `U` (position 2): Valid position (not position 3).  \n  - `S` (position 3): Tests a new location for `S` (allowed by constraints).  \n  - `H` (position 4): Valid position (not position 5).  \n  - `Y` (position 5): Tests a less common letter.  \n- This word respects all constraints, uses confirmed letters (`S`, `U`, `H`) in new positions, and tests two untried letters (`L` and `Y`).\n\n<guess>LUSHY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: SOUTH -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(x) U(-) T(x) H(-)\nGuess 3: LUSHY -> FEEDBACK: L(x) U(✓) S(-) H(-) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: RAISE -> R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)\n  - This means: S is in the word but not in position 4.

From guess1: not in 4, guess2: not in 1, guess3: not in 3. So S must be in position 2 or 5? But wait, position 2 is already taken by U (which is fixed). Therefore, S must be in position 5? Let\'s see:\n\nPositions: 1,2,3,4,5\n\nWe know:\n- S cannot be in 1 (from SOUTH)\n- S cannot be in 3 (from LUSHY)\n- S cannot be in 4 (from RAISE)\n\nSo the only positions left are 2 and 5. But position 2 is occupied by U (which is fixed and correct). Therefore, S cannot be in position 2 because that would require two letters in the same position? No, the word has 5 distinct positions. We have U fixed at position 2, so S must be in position 5.\n\nBut wait, we don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters. However, in the feedback, we have not seen any indication of duplicate letters. But it\'s possible. However, let\'s see:\n\nIn the feedback for LUSHY, we have U at position 2 correct, and S at position 3 is present but wrong position. That means S is in the word but not at 3. It doesn\'t say anything about having two S\'s. But in the secret word, if S is at position 5, then in LUSHY we have S at position 3 which is wrong, but the S at position 5 is not represented in the guess LUSHY? No, LUSHY has S only at position 3. So if the secret word has S at position 5, then in LUSHY we have no S at position 5, so the feedback for S would still be that it is present (because there is an S in the word) but not at position 3. So that is consistent.\n\nBut we also have H at position 4 in LUSHY and it was marked as present but wrong position. So H is in the word but not at position 4.\n\nNow, what about position 5? We haven\'t tested position 5 for S yet. But from the constraints, S must be in position 2 or 5. But position 2 is taken by U, so if the word has only one S, then S must be at 5. But what if the word has two S\'s? Then S could be at 2 and 5? But position 2 is U, which is fixed and correct, so if S were at position 2, then we would have two different letters at the same position? That\'s impossible. Therefore, the secret word cannot have S at position 2 because position 2 is U. Therefore, S must be at position 5.\n\nSo we can conclude: S is at position 5.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check:\n\n- In guess1: RAISE had S at position 4 -> not there.\n- In guess2: SOUTH had S at position 1 -> not there.\n- In guess3: LUSHY had S at position 3 -> not there.\n\nSo the only position left is 5. And position 2 is taken by U, so S must be at 5.\n\nTherefore, we have:\nPosition 2: U (fixed)\nPosition 5: S (must be)\n\nNow, we also have H in the word. From LUSHY, H was at position 4 and we got a minus, so H is not at position 4. From SOUTH, H was at position 5 and we got a minus, but now we know position 5 is S, so that\'s consistent. So H must be in position 1 or 3? Because positions 2 and 5 are taken by U and S.\n\nPositions available: 1, 3, 4.\n\nBut H cannot be at position 4 (from LUSHY feedback) and cannot be at position 5 (from SOUTH, but now we know position 5 is S). So H must be at position 1 or 3.\n\nSimilarly, we have to fill positions 1, 3, and 4 with H and two other letters? But we know H is one of them, and we have two more letters to find.\n\nWe also know the absent letters: R, A, I, E, O, T, L, Y (from the x\'s in the feedback). So absent letters: R, A, I, E, O, T, L, Y.\n\nTherefore, the remaining letters must be from the alphabet excluding these.\n\nAlphabet: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (and possibly H, but H is already known to be present, but we are considering the two other letters).\n\nBut note: we have three positions to fill (1,3,4) and we know one of them is H (but we don\'t know which one). So we need to find two more letters.\n\nWe also have the feedback that H is not at position 4, so H is either at 1 or 3.\n\nNow, for the next guess, we want to try to find the position of H and the other two letters.\n\nWe know the word has the form: _ U _ _ S\n\nAnd the first blank is either H or a new letter, the third blank is either H or a new letter, and the fourth blank is a new letter (since H cannot be at 4).\n\nBut we have three positions: 1, 3, 4. One of them is H (at 1 or 3) and the other two are new letters.\n\nWe can try to form a word that fits this pattern and tests possible letters.\n\nBut we have to avoid the absent letters.\n\nLet me list the known constraints:\n\n- Position 2: U (fixed)\n- Position 5: S (fixed)\n- Position 1: either H or a new letter (from the set of available letters)\n- Position 3: either H or a new letter (but if H is at 1, then position 3 is a new letter, and if H is at 3, then position 1 is a new letter)\n- Position 4: must be a new letter (since H cannot be at 4)\n\nAnd the word must be a valid English word.\n\nWe also know that H is present and must be at 1 or 3.\n\nNow, for the next guess, we can try to test the position of H and also test some common letters for the other positions.\n\nBut we have limited letters left to choose from. The available letters (consonants and vowels) are: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. Note that U is already used and is the only vowel we have? But we don\'t know if there are other vowels. The vowels we have excluded are A, E, I, O. So the only vowel left is U (which we have) and sometimes Y, but Y is excluded. So the word might not have any other vowel. It could be that the other letters are consonants.\n\nSo we are looking for a word of the form: [letter1] U [letter3] [letter4] S\n\nWith letter1 and letter3: one of them is H, the other is a consonant from the available set.\n\nAnd letter4 is a consonant from the available set.\n\nWe can try to guess a word that has H in position 1, and then two new letters for 3 and 4. Or H in position 3 and new letters for 1 and 4.\n\nBut we don\'t know which, so we might need to test.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has H in position 1 and then common consonants for 3 and 4, and see the feedback.\n\nBut we have to make sure the word is valid.\n\nLet me think of words that end with US and have H in the word.\n\nSince we know the last two letters are _ S, and the second letter is U, so the last two are US. So the word ends with US.\n\nWe need a word of the form: ? U ? ? S\n\nWith H in position 1 or 3.\n\nPossible words:\n\nIf H is at position 1: H U ? ? S\n\nExamples: HUSKS, HUNKS, HUFFS, HUMPH (but 5 letters? HUMPH is 5 letters: H,U,M,P,H -> but H at 1 and 5, but we have S at 5? No, position 5 is S, so it must end with S, not H. So HUMPH ends with H, not S. So invalid.\n\nHUMPS: H,U,M,P,S -> that\'s 5 letters: positions: H(1),U(2),M(3),P(4),S(5). This is a valid word.\n\nSimilarly, HUNKS: H,U,N,K,S.\n\nHULLS: H,U,L,L,S -> but L is excluded (from LUSHY feedback: L(x)), so we cannot use L.\n\nBut L is excluded, so we avoid L.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot use Y, etc.\n\nSo HUMPS: uses M and P, which are available.\n\nHUNKS: uses N and K, available.\n\nIf H is at position 3: then the word is ? U H ? S\n\nExamples: BUHLS (not a word), MUHLS (not common), but we need valid words.\n\nMore common: SUHUS? Not a word. DUHAS? Not a word.\n\nPerhaps: ACHUS? But A is excluded.\n\nWe need to find words that are valid and avoid excluded letters.\n\nList of possible words:\n\nOption 1: H at 1: \n- HUMPS (H, U, M, P, S) -> M and P are new.\n- HUNKS (H, U, N, K, S) -> N and K.\n- HUFFS (H, U, F, F, S) -> but F repeated? And we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. But we can try, but it\'s a valid word.\n\nOption 2: H at 3:\n- We need words like ? U H ? S\n  Examples: \n  - MUCHS? Not a word.\n  - BUGHS? Not a word.\n  - DUMPS? D,U,M,P,S -> but H is not in this word? We need H at position 3. DUMPS has no H.\n  - We need the third letter to be H.\n  - Words: SUHUS? Not valid.\n  - Perhaps: ACHES? But A and E excluded.\n  - NUHUS? Not a word.\n\nIt seems difficult to find a word with H at position 3 and ending with US.\n\nAnother one: LUGHS? L is excluded, and it ends with HS, not S? LUGHS is L,U,G,H,S -> that\'s 5 letters: positions: L(1),U(2),G(3),H(4),S(5). But in this case, H is at position 4, but we know H cannot be at position 4 (from LUSHY feedback: H at position 4 was marked as present but wrong position, meaning it is not at 4). So H cannot be at 4. Therefore, we cannot have a word with H at 4.\n\nSo for H at position 3, we need a word: ? U H ? S\n\nThe fourth position must be a letter that is not H and not excluded.\n\nExamples: \n- BUGHS: B,U,G,H,S -> but that\'s H at position 4? No: B(1), U(2), G(3), H(4), S(5). But H at 4 is not allowed.\n- We need the third letter to be H and the fourth to be something else.\n\nSo: ? U H X S\n\nWhat words are there? \n- DUCHS? Not a word.\n- PUMAS? But P,U,M,A,S -> A is excluded and no H.\n- Perhaps: HUHUS? Not a word.\n\nI think it\'s hard to find a common word with H at position 3 and ending with US. So maybe H is more likely at position 1.\n\nTherefore, we can try a word with H at position 1 and two new letters.\n\nFor example, HUMPS or HUNKS.\n\nBut we also have to consider that in the feedback, we have not tested many letters. We have tested: R,A,I,E,O,T,L,Y and they are absent. So we have many letters left.\n\nBut we can try HUMPS: H U M P S\n\nThis would test:\n- H at position 1: if it\'s correct, we get a check. If not, then H must be at position 3 (and we get a minus or if absent then we have a problem, but we know H is present so we would get a minus if not at 1).\n- M at position 3: if present, we get feedback.\n- P at position 4: if present, we get feedback.\n\nBut note: we are also testing the letter M and P.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to test more common letters. For example, N is more common than M and P? But both are reasonable.\n\nAnother word: HUSKS? H U S K S -> but S is repeated. We have S at position 1? No, H at 1, U at 2, S at 3, K at 4, S at 5. But we already know S is at 5, so if we put S at 3, that would be a duplicate. But we don\'t know if the word has two S\'s. However, in the feedback so far, we have not had any duplicate, but it\'s possible. But to avoid complexity, we might avoid duplicates for now.\n\nIn HUMPS, we don\'t have duplicates.\n\nSimilarly, HUNKS: H U N K S -> no duplicates.\n\nBut in HUNKS, we have K at position 4 and S at 5.\n\nWe can choose one.\n\nBut we also have the possibility that H is at position 3. If we try HUMPS and H is actually at position 3, then in HUMPS we would have H at position 1 which is wrong, so we would get a minus for H (meaning it\'s present but not at 1) and then we know H must be at 3. And then we would also get feedback on M and P.\n\nSo that\'s acceptable.\n\nSimilarly, if we try a word that has H at position 3, but as we saw, it\'s hard to find a common word.\n\nAnother word: what about ""PUSHY""? But we already tried LUSHY and Y is excluded, and PUSHY has P,U,S,H,Y. But Y is excluded and we know that. Also, in PUSHY, S is at position 3, which we know is not correct (from LUSHY feedback, S is not at 3). And we know position 5 is S, so PUSHY has S at 3 and no S at 5? But we have to have S at 5, so PUSHY would have S at 3 and the secret word has S at 5, so the feedback for S would be minus (because it\'s present but not at 3) and we already know that. But we also have H at position 4, which we know is not allowed (H cannot be at 4). So PUSHY is invalid because it places H at 4.\n\nSo not good.\n\nTherefore, I think trying a word with H at position 1 is the way to go.\n\nSo let\'s choose between HUMPS and HUNKS.\n\nHUMPS: H, U, M, P, S\nHUNKS: H, U, N, K, S\n\nBoth are valid. We can choose one that uses more common letters.\n\nN is more common than M and P? In English, N is very common.\n\nBut we are testing two letters. Let\'s see the frequency: N is more common than K, and M and P are both common.\n\nBut we can choose HUNKS because N is a very common letter.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that tests even more common letters. What about CHUMS? But C is available. CHUMS: C,H,U,M,S -> but H is at position 2? No: C(1),H(2),U(3),M(4),S(5). But we need U at position 2, so that doesn\'t fit.\n\nWe must have U at position 2 and S at position 5.\n\nSo the word must be: ? U ? ?

We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE -> R(x), A(x), I(x), S(-), E(x)
  - S is present, but not in position 4.

Guess 2: SOUTH -> S(-), O(x), U(-), T(x), H(-)
  - S is present, but not in position 1.
  - U is present, but not in position 3.
  - H is present, but not in position 5.
  - O and T are absent.

Guess 3: LUSHY -> L(x), U(✓), S(-), H(-), Y(x)
  - U is correct in position 2.
  - S is present, but not in position 3.
  - H is present, but not in position 4.
  - L and Y are absent.

Guess 4: HUNKS -> H(✓), U(✓), N(x), K(x), S(✓)
  - H is correct in position 1, U in position 2, and S in position 5.
  - N and K are absent.

Now, consolidating the information:

Confirmed letters and positions:
- Position 1: H (from HUNKS, now fixed)
- Position 2: U (fixed from LUSHY)
- Position 5: S (we deduced earlier and confirmed by ✓ in HUNKS)

Since we now have H at position 1, U at position 2, and S at position 5, the word is: H U _ _ S

We need to fill positions 3 and 4.

From the feedback, we also know the absent letters: R, A, I, E, O, T, L, Y, N, K.

So the absent letters are: R, A, I, E, O, T, L, Y, N, K.

We can list the available letters: B, C, D, F, G, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. (And note that H, U, S are already placed and known.)

The word must be a valid English word of the form H U _ _ S.

We have two blanks to fill with two new letters from the available set.

Now, common letters to consider: from the available letters, we can look for frequent consonants: F, C, P, M, G, etc.

We need to think of 5-letter words starting with ""HU"" and ending with ""S"".

Some possibilities: 
- HUMPS (but M and P are available, but we haven't tested them? However, we already used HUNKS and know N and K are absent, but HUMPS uses M and P, which are untested.)
- HUBBS? Not a common word.
- HUFFS? Also, F repeated? But valid.
- HULLS? But L is absent.

Given the constraints, let's list possible words:

- HUMPS: H, U, M, P, S
- HUFFS: H, U, F, F, S
- HUGES? But E is absent -> H,U,G,E,S -> E absent, invalid.
- HUTCH: H,U,T,C,H -> T is absent and ends with H, not S? Invalid.
- HURTS: U is at position 2? But T absent and R absent? Invalid.
- HUSSY: but Y is absent and S repeated? But S repeated might be possible? However, we have no indication of multiple S's, but we already have one S at position 5. The word would have S at position 3 as well? Let's see: H,U,S,S,Y -> but Y is absent, and we don't know if two S's are allowed. But Y is absent.

So likely candidates: HUMPS, HUFFS, HUCKS? But K absent -> invalid because K is absent (from HUNKS feedback).

Also, HUMUS? But U at position 3? HUMUS: H,U,M,U,S -> U at position 2 and 4? The word has two U's? We haven't tested for duplicates. But note, secret word already has U at position 2, and if it has another U? But if we try HUMUS, position 3 is M, position 4 is U. But we don't know if U is repeated. And also, in our feedback so far, we haven't had duplicates. But to be safe, let's avoid duplicates for now.

HUMPH: ends with H, not S? Invalid.

So HUMPS and HUFFS are candidates.

But HUFFS has two F's. We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but it is a valid word.

We can test HUMPS: if we try and get feedback.

But we have only one guess left? We have used 4 guesses, so we have 2 tries left (since 6 tries total).

We are at guess 5. We can try HUMPS.

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests one of the letters without duplicates.

But HUMPS is a good candidate.

Note: In HUNKS, we tried N and K and found they are absent. So for HUMPS, we are testing M and P.

If we try HUMPS, we might solve it if it's correct.

But let's see if there are other words.

Another word: HUMUS? As above, but has two U's? HUMUS: H,U,M,U,S -> positions: H1, U2, M3, U4, S5. So U at position 4? We don't know if U is duplicated. But in previous feedback, U has been only at position 2, but the secret word might have two U's. However, in SOUTH, we had U at position 3 and got a minus, meaning U was present but not at position 3. It doesn't say if there are additional U's. So possible. But HUMUS is a food item and a valid word, but we try to avoid duplicates? Not necessarily.

But we have absent letters that constrain.

We can also note that in the word, positions 3 and 4 must be two consonants from the available set.

Now, let's think: common words ending with US that start with HU? There are not many.

Given the known absent letters, the best candidates are HUMPS and HUFFS.

But HUFFS has duplicate F, but that's acceptable.

Perhaps HUCKS? But K is absent.

HUMPS: If we get HUMPS and the secret word is that, then we win. Otherwise, we can get feedback on M and P.

Similarly, if we try HUMPS and it has a minus or x, then we know M and/or P are absent or misplaced.

But note: the word is H U _ _ S, so if we put M in position 3 and P in position 4, then we test both.

So I think HUMPS is a good guess.

But let's confirm: if the secret word is HUMPS, then we get H(✓) U(✓) M(?) P(?) S(✓). If M is correct and P is correct, we win.

If M is not in position 3, we might get a minus and know that M is in the word but not at 3? But since there are no other positions for M (only positions 3 and 4, but we are testing both), so if M is present but not at position 3, it must be at position 4? Similarly for P.

But we don't know how many letters are left to test.

We can also consider a guess that uses different letters to cover more ground. But we only have two positions left.

Alternatively, we could test a word that doesn't assume H is at position 1? But we already know H is at position 1 from HUNKS feedback (H(✓)), so position 1 is fixed as H.

So the word is definitely H U ? ? S.

No alternative.

We need to fill two positions with two letters from the available set.

Our available letters: B, C, D, F, G, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We don't need to use duplicate letters necessarily? But in words like HUFFS it's duplicated.

To maximize the chance of getting it right, we can choose the most common English word.

HUMPS meaning multiple humps? Or as a verb. It's valid.

HUFFS meaning to show annoyance.

Both are valid, but HUMPS might be more common? Or HUFFS.

Another word: HUSKS? But in HUNKS, we used N and K and they are absent? HUSKS: H,U,S,K,S -> S at position 3 and 5? But we have S at position 5 already, and we know S is present, but we don't know if duplicated. And K is absent, so invalid.

Similarly, HULKS: L and K absent.

So HUMPS or HUFFS.

Let me search for other options: HUGHS? Not common.

HUMPS seems a good bet.

Since we have two guesses, we can try HUMPS. If it's not correct, we will get feedback and use the last guess.

So let's go with HUMPS.

But note: we haven't tested M or P before, so they are fair game.

Therefore, the next guess is HUMPS.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Review Feedback from Previous Guesses**:
   - **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: 
     - `S` is in the word but not in position 4.  
     - `R`, `A`, `I`, `E` are absent.
   - **Guess 2 (SOUTH)**: 
     - `S` is in the word but not in position 1.  
     - `U` is in the word but not in position 3.  
     - `H` is in the word but not in position 5.  
     - `O`, `T` are absent.
   - **Guess 3 (LUSHY)**: 
     - `U` is correct in position 2 (fixed).  
     - `S` is in the word but not in position 3.  
     - `H` is in the word but not in position 4.  
     - `L`, `Y` are absent.
   - **Guess 4 (HUNKS)**: 
     - `H` is correct in position 1 (fixed).  
     - `U` is correct in position 2 (reconfirmed).  
     - `S` is correct in position 5 (fixed).  
     - `N`, `K` are absent.

2. **Key Deductions**:
   - **Fixed Letters and Positions**:  
     - Position 1: `H`  
     - Position 2: `U`  
     - Position 5: `S`  
     - The word is `H U _ _ S`.
   - **Confirmed Absent Letters**: `R`, `A`, `I`, `E`, `O`, `T`, `L`, `Y`, `N`, `K` (all marked ""x"" across guesses).  
   - **Remaining Letters**: Only positions 3 and 4 are unknown, requiring two new letters from the available pool: `B`, `C`, `D`, `F`, `G`, `J`, `M`, `P`, `Q`, `V`, `W`, `X`, `Z`.  
   - **Constraints**:  
     - Position 3 and 4 must be filled with distinct or repeated letters (no duplicates have been indicated yet, but feedback doesn't rule out the possibility).

3. **Strategy for Guess 5**:  
   - Test high-frequency consonants (`M`, `P`, `F`, `G`) in positions 3 and 4 to maximize information.  
   - **Selected word: HUMPS**  
     - `H` (1), `U` (2), `M` (3), `P` (4), `S` (5).  
   - **Why HUMPS?**  
     - Tests `M` in position 3 and `P` in position 4 (both new, untested letters).  
     - If correct, this guess solves the word.  
     - If incorrect, feedback on `M` and `P` will reveal their status (✓, -, or x), leaving only one guess to deduce the final word.

<guess>HUMPS</guess>",HUMPS,"We have feedback from four guesses:

We need to fill positions 3 and 4.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get. Ideally, we choose a word with 5 distinct letters that are common in 5-letter words. A common starting word is ""CRATE"" or ""SLATE"" or ""ROATE"". Another popular starting word is ""RAISE"". Let's choose ""RAISE"" because it has common letters: R, A, I, S, E.

Guess: RAISEFor the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that maximizes information gain by using common letters and avoiding duplicates. The word ""RAISE"" is a strong starter because it contains five distinct letters: R, A, I, S, and E. These letters are among the most frequent in English 5-letter words, increasing the likelihood of revealing correct positions or existing letters in the secret word. If any letters match (with ✓ or -), future guesses can build on this information efficiently. If none appear (all x), that still significantly narrows possibilities.

<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The letter S is in the secret word, but not in the 4th position (since in RAISE, S is the 4th letter and we got a '-' meaning it's present but misplaced).
- The letters R, A, I, E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains S and it must be in one of the positions: 1, 2, 3, or 5 (since it's not in position 4). But note that in the feedback, S was in position 4 and was marked as present but wrong position, so S is definitely in the word, just not at position 4.

We also know that the secret word does not contain R, A, I, or E.

For the next guess, we need to choose a 5-letter word that:
- Includes the letter S (since we know it's in the word) but not in the 4th position (because we already tried that and it was wrong).
- Avoids the letters R, A, I, E (since they are not in the word).
- We want to test other common letters to get more information.

We have 6 tries, so we can use this guess to narrow down the position of S and also test new letters.

Possible positions for S: 1, 2, 3, 5.

We should also try to include other common consonants and vowels that we haven't tried. Since we know the word has S, and we have eliminated R, A, I, E, the remaining vowels are O, U and sometimes Y. Consonants we haven't tried include T, N, L, C, D, H, etc.

A good strategy is to pick a word that has S in a different position and uses new letters to cover more ground.

Let's think of words that have S and avoid R, A, I, E.

For example, we can try S in the first position: words like ""SOUTH"", ""SONIC"", ""SOLID"", etc.

But note: we also want to test other common letters. Since we have only one confirmed letter (S) and four new positions to test, we should choose a word with as many new common letters as possible.

Alternatively, we can try S in the second position: words like ""USUAL"" (but U is repeated and we have A which is eliminated? Wait, A is eliminated so we cannot use A). We must avoid A.

Let me list some candidate words:

- S in position 1: 
  - S with O: ""SOLAR"" (but has A and R, which are eliminated) -> invalid.
  - ""SONLY"" (not a word) 
  - ""SONGS"" (has S repeated, and we don't know if S is repeated, but it's acceptable; however, we are avoiding A, R, I, E, so this is okay? But S is repeated and we don't know if the word has two S's. Also, we are trying to get new letters. ""SONGS"" has O, N, G, S. But S is at position 1 and 5. We know S is in the word, but we don't know if it's repeated. We can try, but maybe not the best because we are repeating S and we might not get information about other letters.

We want to use distinct letters if possible to maximize information.

So, let's try to find a word with S in position 1 and four new distinct letters that are not R, A, I, E.

Possible words: 
- ""SOUTH"" -> S, O, U, T, H. All distinct and new. This is a good candidate.
- ""SHOWN"" -> S, H, O, W, N. Also good.
- ""SLUNG"" -> S, L, U, N, G. Good.

But note: we have eliminated E, so we don't have to worry about that.

Alternatively, S in position 2: 
- Words like ""USHER"" (has E and R, eliminated) -> invalid.
- ""PSYCH"" (not 5 letters? ""PSYCH"" is not a word, but ""PSYCH"" is a root, not a word. We need valid words.)
- ""MUSTY"" -> M, U, S, T, Y. S is in position 3? Let's see: M (1), U (2), S (3), T (4), Y (5). So if we put S in position 3, that's a new position. But we want to test S in a position we haven't tried? We only tried position 4 so far. So positions 1,2,3,5 are available.

We can try S in position 3? But in the first guess, we had S in position 4 and it was misplaced. So we know S is in the word but not at position 4. We can try any of 1,2,3,5.

But to maximize information, we might want to try a position that is common for S, such as the beginning or the end.

Another candidate: S in position 5: 
- Words like ""FOCUS"" -> F, O, C, U, S. S at the end. This is good because we test S at position 5 and new letters.

But note: we also want to cover more common letters. The most common consonants in English are T, N, S, L, R (but R is eliminated), so T, N, L are good to test.

Also, vowels: we have only tested A, I, E and they are out. So we should test O and U.

Therefore, a word that includes S (not in position 4) and also includes T, N, L, O, U, etc.

Let me think of a word that has S and T, for example.

One classic second guess after getting one letter is to try a word that places the known letter in a different position and uses new common letters.

I think ""SOUTH"" is a strong candidate: 
- S at position 1 (new position)
- O, U, T, H: all new and common.

Another candidate: ""SHUNT"" -> S, H, U, N, T. S at position 1, and we test H, U, N, T.

But ""SOUTH"" is more common.

Alternatively, ""STOMP"" -> S, T, O, M, P. But we have S at 1 and T at 2.

But we don't know if the word has T or not.

We can also consider ""LUSTY"" -> L, U, S, T, Y. S at position 3. This tests L, U, S (at 3), T, Y.

But we are testing S at position 3, which is a new position.

I think ""SOUTH"" is a good choice because:
- It places S at position 1 (we haven't tried S at 1)
- It tests O, U, T, H which are common and we haven't tried them.

So, let's go with ""SOUTH"".

But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""SOUTH"" is a valid English word.

Therefore, the next guess is ""SOUTH"".

We'll see if S is at position 1 (if we get a check) or if it's elsewhere (if we get a minus). Also, we'll get information about O, U, T, H.

If S is not at position 1, we might get a minus for S, meaning it's in the word but not at 1, and then we know it must be at 2,3, or 5 (since 4 is already tried and we know it's not there).

But we are trying position 1 now.

So, I think ""SOUTH"" is a good second guess.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, A, I, E are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- S is in the secret word but **not in the 4th position** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- The word must include **S** (since it's confirmed in the secret word) but avoid placing it in the 4th position again.
- It should exclude R, A, I, E (as they are absent from the secret word).
- To maximize information, the guess should test new common letters (e.g., O, U, T, H, N, L) and position S in a new location (e.g., position 1, 2, 3, or 5).

A strong candidate is **""SOUTH""**:
- Places S in position 1 (a new position to test).
- Introduces new common letters: O, U, T, H.
- Avoids R, A, I, E and uses distinct letters for efficient feedback.

<guess>SOUTH</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SOUTH -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(x) U(-) T(x) H(-)
<｜Assistant｜>Alright, let me figure this out step by step. From the first guess ""RAISE"", we know that S is in the word but not in the fourth position, and R, A, I, E are definitely not in the word. 

Now looking at the second guess ""SOUTH"":
- S(-) means S is still in the word but not in the first position (since we placed it there)
- O(x) is new information - O is not in the word at all
- U(-) means U is in the word but not in the third position
- T(x) means T is not in the word
- H(-) means H is in the word but not in the fifth position

So combining everything we know:
Confirmed in word: S, U, H
Confirmed not in word: R, A, I, E, O, T
Position constraints:
- S cannot be in pos 1 or 4
- U cannot be in pos 3
- H cannot be in pos 5

Possible positions left for S: 2 or 3
For U: 1,2,4,5
For H: 1,2,3,4

Now we need a word that:
1. Contains S (in pos 2 or 3), U and H
2. Avoids R,A,I,E,O,T
3. Has two new letters to test

Considering letter frequency, good candidates might be consonants like N, L, M or vowel Y. Since three letters are already confirmed, we can use the remaining positions to test new letters.

Possible words come to mind:
""SHULY"" - but not a valid word
""PUSHY"" - has P,Y and positions S(3),U(2),H(5). Checking positions:
- S is in pos 3? Could work
- U in pos 2? Possible
- H in pos 5? But H cannot be in pos 5 as per feedback (H(-) in SOUTH means H is not in pos 5)

I need to mind the position constraints. H cannot be in pos 5, U cannot be in pos 3, S cannot be in pos 1 or 4.

Another idea: ""BUSHW"" - not valid
""LUSHY"" - valid word: L U S H Y
Breakdown:
- Pos2 U - U can be here? Feedback said U was not in pos 3, but pos2 is okay
- Pos3 S - S can be in pos3 (since not 1 or 4)
- Pos4 H - H can be in pos4 (since not 5)
- Pos1 L (new letter)
- Pos5 Y (new letter)

Constraints satisfied:
- S is in pos3 (allowed)
- U in pos2 (not pos3, good)
- H in pos4 (not pos5, good)
No R,A,I,E,O,T used

This looks promising. Another option could be ""MUSHY"" but contains M instead of L.

Both test two new consonants. Since L is slightly more common than M, ""LUSHY"" might be slightly better for information gain. Also ""Y"" at the end might be less common but worth including.

So ""LUSHY"" seems like a strong candidate - it places all known letters in new valid positions and tests L and Y for the remaining spots.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

### Key Information from Feedback:
1. **From RAISE (Guess 1):**  
   - `R`, `A`, `I`, `E` are **not in the word** (all ""x"").  
   - `S` is in the word but **not in position 4** (marked ""-"").

2. **From SOUTH (Guess 2):**  
   - `S` is in the word but **not in position 1** (marked ""-"").  
   - `O` and `T` are **not in the word** (both ""x"").  
   - `U` is in the word but **not in position 3** (marked ""-"").  
   - `H` is in the word but **not in position 5** (marked ""-"").

### Deductions:
- **Confirmed letters in the secret word**: `S`, `U`, `H`.  
- **Confirmed absent letters**: `R`, `A`, `I`, `E`, `O`, `T`.  
- **Position constraints**:  
  - `S` must be in **position 2 or 3** (since it is not in 1 or 4).  
  - `U` cannot be in position 3.  
  - `H` cannot be in position 5.  
- **Remaining vowel/consonant options**: The word excludes common vowels like `A`, `E`, `I`, `O`, so `U` (already confirmed) is the primary vowel. Consonants like `L`, `N`, `M`, `Y`, `P`, `B`, or `C` are candidates for testing.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- The guess must include `S`, `U`, and `H` while adhering to position constraints.  
- Place `S` in position 2 or 3 to test its correct location.  
- Place `U` and `H` in new positions (e.g., not position 3 for `U`, not position 5 for `H`).  
- Test **two new letters** to maximize information (e.g., `L` and `Y`).  
- Avoid absent letters (`R`, `A`, `I`, `E`, `O`, `T`).  

### Selected Guess: **LUSHY**
- **Why this word?**  
  - `L` (position 1): Tests a new common letter.  
  - `U` (position 2): Valid position (not position 3).  
  - `S` (position 3): Tests a new location for `S` (allowed by constraints).  
  - `H` (position 4): Valid position (not position 5).  
  - `Y` (position 5): Tests a less common letter.  
- This word respects all constraints, uses confirmed letters (`S`, `U`, `H`) in new positions, and tests two untried letters (`L` and `Y`).

<guess>LUSHY</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SOUTH -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(x) U(-) T(x) H(-)
Guess 3: LUSHY -> FEEDBACK: L(x) U(✓) S(-) H(-) Y(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE -> R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)
  - This means: S is in the word but not in position 4. R, A, I, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: SOUTH -> S(-) O(x) U(-) T(x) H(-)
  - S is in the word but not in position 1 (since we got - for S in position 1).
  - O and T are not in the word.
  - U is in the word but not in position 3 (since we placed U in position 3 and got -).
  - H is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 3: LUSHY -> L(x) U(✓) S(-) H(-) Y(x)
  - U is correct and in position 2 (since we placed U in position 2 and got ✓).
  - S is in the word but not in position 3 (we placed S in position 3 and got -).
  - H is in the word but not in position 4 (we placed H in position 4 and got -).
  - L and Y are not in the word.

Now, let's consolidate the information:

Confirmed letters in the word: S, U, H (from the - and ✓ we know they are present).

U is fixed in position 2 because we got a ✓ for U in position 2.

S is in the word but not in position 1, 3, or 4. From guess1: not in 4, guess2: not in 1, guess3: not in 3. So S must be in position 2 or 5? But wait, position 2 is already taken by U (which is fixed). Therefore, S must be in position 5? Let's see:

Positions: 1,2,3,4,5

We know:
- S cannot be in 1 (from SOUTH)
- S cannot be in 3 (from LUSHY)
- S cannot be in 4 (from RAISE)

So the only positions left are 2 and 5. But position 2 is occupied by U (which is fixed and correct). Therefore, S cannot be in position 2 because that would require two letters in the same position? No, the word has 5 distinct positions. We have U fixed at position 2, so S must be in position 5.

But wait, we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. However, in the feedback, we have not seen any indication of duplicate letters. But it's possible. However, let's see:

In the feedback for LUSHY, we have U at position 2 correct, and S at position 3 is present but wrong position. That means S is in the word but not at 3. It doesn't say anything about having two S's. But in the secret word, if S is at position 5, then in LUSHY we have S at position 3 which is wrong, but the S at position 5 is not represented in the guess LUSHY? No, LUSHY has S only at position 3. So if the secret word has S at position 5, then in LUSHY we have no S at position 5, so the feedback for S would still be that it is present (because there is an S in the word) but not at position 3. So that is consistent.

But we also have H at position 4 in LUSHY and it was marked as present but wrong position. So H is in the word but not at position 4.

Now, what about position 5? We haven't tested position 5 for S yet. But from the constraints, S must be in position 2 or 5. But position 2 is taken by U, so if the word has only one S, then S must be at 5. But what if the word has two S's? Then S could be at 2 and 5? But position 2 is U, which is fixed and correct, so if S were at position 2, then we would have two different letters at the same position? That's impossible. Therefore, the secret word cannot have S at position 2 because position 2 is U. Therefore, S must be at position 5.

So we can conclude: S is at position 5.

But wait, let me double-check:

- In guess1: RAISE had S at position 4 -> not there.
- In guess2: SOUTH had S at position 1 -> not there.
- In guess3: LUSHY had S at position 3 -> not there.

So the only position left is 5. And position 2 is taken by U, so S must be at 5.

Therefore, we have:
Position 2: U (fixed)
Position 5: S (must be)

Now, we also have H in the word. From LUSHY, H was at position 4 and we got a minus, so H is not at position 4. From SOUTH, H was at position 5 and we got a minus, but now we know position 5 is S, so that's consistent. So H must be in position 1 or 3? Because positions 2 and 5 are taken by U and S.

Positions available: 1, 3, 4.

But H cannot be at position 4 (from LUSHY feedback) and cannot be at position 5 (from SOUTH, but now we know position 5 is S). So H must be at position 1 or 3.

Similarly, we have to fill positions 1, 3, and 4 with H and two other letters? But we know H is one of them, and we have two more letters to find.

We also know the absent letters: R, A, I, E, O, T, L, Y (from the x's in the feedback). So absent letters: R, A, I, E, O, T, L, Y.

Therefore, the remaining letters must be from the alphabet excluding these.

Alphabet: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (and possibly H, but H is already known to be present, but we are considering the two other letters).

But note: we have three positions to fill (1,3,4) and we know one of them is H (but we don't know which one). So we need to find two more letters.

We also have the feedback that H is not at position 4, so H is either at 1 or 3.

Now, for the next guess, we want to try to find the position of H and the other two letters.

We know the word has the form: _ U _ _ S

And the first blank is either H or a new letter, the third blank is either H or a new letter, and the fourth blank is a new letter (since H cannot be at 4).

But we have three positions: 1, 3, 4. One of them is H (at 1 or 3) and the other two are new letters.

We can try to form a word that fits this pattern and tests possible letters.

But we have to avoid the absent letters.

Let me list the known constraints:

- Position 2: U (fixed)
- Position 5: S (fixed)
- Position 1: either H or a new letter (from the set of available letters)
- Position 3: either H or a new letter (but if H is at 1, then position 3 is a new letter, and if H is at 3, then position 1 is a new letter)
- Position 4: must be a new letter (since H cannot be at 4)

And the word must be a valid English word.

We also know that H is present and must be at 1 or 3.

Now, for the next guess, we can try to test the position of H and also test some common letters for the other positions.

But we have limited letters left to choose from. The available letters (consonants and vowels) are: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. Note that U is already used and is the only vowel we have? But we don't know if there are other vowels. The vowels we have excluded are A, E, I, O. So the only vowel left is U (which we have) and sometimes Y, but Y is excluded. So the word might not have any other vowel. It could be that the other letters are consonants.

So we are looking for a word of the form: [letter1] U [letter3] [letter4] S

With letter1 and letter3: one of them is H, the other is a consonant from the available set.

And letter4 is a consonant from the available set.

We can try to guess a word that has H in position 1, and then two new letters for 3 and 4. Or H in position 3 and new letters for 1 and 4.

But we don't know which, so we might need to test.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has H in position 1 and then common consonants for 3 and 4, and see the feedback.

But we have to make sure the word is valid.

Let me think of words that end with US and have H in the word.

Since we know the last two letters are _ S, and the second letter is U, so the last two are US. So the word ends with US.

We need a word of the form: ? U ? ? S

With H in position 1 or 3.

Possible words:

If H is at position 1: H U ? ? S

Examples: HUSKS, HUNKS, HUFFS, HUMPH (but 5 letters? HUMPH is 5 letters: H,U,M,P,H -> but H at 1 and 5, but we have S at 5? No, position 5 is S, so it must end with S, not H. So HUMPH ends with H, not S. So invalid.

HUMPS: H,U,M,P,S -> that's 5 letters: positions: H(1),U(2),M(3),P(4),S(5). This is a valid word.

Similarly, HUNKS: H,U,N,K,S.

HULLS: H,U,L,L,S -> but L is excluded (from LUSHY feedback: L(x)), so we cannot use L.

But L is excluded, so we avoid L.

Similarly, we cannot use Y, etc.

So HUMPS: uses M and P, which are available.

HUNKS: uses N and K, available.

If H is at position 3: then the word is ? U H ? S

Examples: BUHLS (not a word), MUHLS (not common), but we need valid words.

More common: SUHUS? Not a word. DUHAS? Not a word.

Perhaps: ACHUS? But A is excluded.

We need to find words that are valid and avoid excluded letters.

List of possible words:

Option 1: H at 1: 
- HUMPS (H, U, M, P, S) -> M and P are new.
- HUNKS (H, U, N, K, S) -> N and K.
- HUFFS (H, U, F, F, S) -> but F repeated? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. But we can try, but it's a valid word.

Option 2: H at 3:
- We need words like ? U H ? S
  Examples: 
  - MUCHS? Not a word.
  - BUGHS? Not a word.
  - DUMPS? D,U,M,P,S -> but H is not in this word? We need H at position 3. DUMPS has no H.
  - We need the third letter to be H.
  - Words: SUHUS? Not valid.
  - Perhaps: ACHES? But A and E excluded.
  - NUHUS? Not a word.

It seems difficult to find a word with H at position 3 and ending with US.

Another one: LUGHS? L is excluded, and it ends with HS, not S? LUGHS is L,U,G,H,S -> that's 5 letters: positions: L(1),U(2),G(3),H(4),S(5). But in this case, H is at position 4, but we know H cannot be at position 4 (from LUSHY feedback: H at position 4 was marked as present but wrong position, meaning it is not at 4). So H cannot be at 4. Therefore, we cannot have a word with H at 4.

So for H at position 3, we need a word: ? U H ? S

The fourth position must be a letter that is not H and not excluded.

Examples: 
- BUGHS: B,U,G,H,S -> but that's H at position 4? No: B(1), U(2), G(3), H(4), S(5). But H at 4 is not allowed.
- We need the third letter to be H and the fourth to be something else.

So: ? U H X S

What words are there? 
- DUCHS? Not a word.
- PUMAS? But P,U,M,A,S -> A is excluded and no H.
- Perhaps: HUHUS? Not a word.

I think it's hard to find a common word with H at position 3 and ending with US. So maybe H is more likely at position 1.

Therefore, we can try a word with H at position 1 and two new letters.

For example, HUMPS or HUNKS.

But we also have to consider that in the feedback, we have not tested many letters. We have tested: R,A,I,E,O,T,L,Y and they are absent. So we have many letters left.

But we can try HUMPS: H U M P S

This would test:
- H at position 1: if it's correct, we get a check. If not, then H must be at position 3 (and we get a minus or if absent then we have a problem, but we know H is present so we would get a minus if not at 1).
- M at position 3: if present, we get feedback.
- P at position 4: if present, we get feedback.

But note: we are also testing the letter M and P.

Alternatively, we can try to test more common letters. For example, N is more common than M and P? But both are reasonable.

Another word: HUSKS? H U S K S -> but S is repeated. We have S at position 1? No, H at 1, U at 2, S at 3, K at 4, S at 5. But we already know S is at 5, so if we put S at 3, that would be a duplicate. But we don't know if the word has two S's. However, in the feedback so far, we have not had any duplicate, but it's possible. But to avoid complexity, we might avoid duplicates for now.

In HUMPS, we don't have duplicates.

Similarly, HUNKS: H U N K S -> no duplicates.

But in HUNKS, we have K at position 4 and S at 5.

We can choose one.

But we also have the possibility that H is at position 3. If we try HUMPS and H is actually at position 3, then in HUMPS we would have H at position 1 which is wrong, so we would get a minus for H (meaning it's present but not at 1) and then we know H must be at 3. And then we would also get feedback on M and P.

So that's acceptable.

Similarly, if we try a word that has H at position 3, but as we saw, it's hard to find a common word.

Another word: what about ""PUSHY""? But we already tried LUSHY and Y is excluded, and PUSHY has P,U,S,H,Y. But Y is excluded and we know that. Also, in PUSHY, S is at position 3, which we know is not correct (from LUSHY feedback, S is not at 3). And we know position 5 is S, so PUSHY has S at 3 and no S at 5? But we have to have S at 5, so PUSHY would have S at 3 and the secret word has S at 5, so the feedback for S would be minus (because it's present but not at 3) and we already know that. But we also have H at position 4, which we know is not allowed (H cannot be at 4). So PUSHY is invalid because it places H at 4.

So not good.

Therefore, I think trying a word with H at position 1 is the way to go.

So let's choose between HUMPS and HUNKS.

HUMPS: H, U, M, P, S
HUNKS: H, U, N, K, S

Both are valid. We can choose one that uses more common letters.

N is more common than M and P? In English, N is very common.

But we are testing two letters. Let's see the frequency: N is more common than K, and M and P are both common.

But we can choose HUNKS because N is a very common letter.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests even more common letters. What about CHUMS? But C is available. CHUMS: C,H,U,M,S -> but H is at position 2? No: C(1),H(2),U(3),M(4),S(5). But we need U at position 2, so that doesn't fit.

We must have U at position 2 and S at position 5.

So the word must be: ? U ? ? S

With H at 1 or 3.

So HUNKS: H at 1, U at 2, N at 3, K at 4, S at 5.

HUMPS: H at 1, U at 2, M at 3, P at 4, S at 5.

Another word: FUMES? But E is excluded.

BUMFS? Not a word.

So I think HUNKS or HUMPS are good.

I'll go with HUNKS because it uses N and K, which are common.

But we have not tested N or K before.

So let's guess HUNKS.

But note: if H is not at position 1, then we will get a minus for H, meaning it is present but not at 1, so it must be at position 3. Then we would know that for the next guess.

Similarly, we get feedback on N and K.

So it's a good test.

Therefore, the next guess is HUNKS.### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback history:
- **Guess 1: RAISE** → R(x), A(x), I(x), S(-), E(x)  
  - `S` is in the word but not in position 4.  
  - `R`, `A`, `I`, `E` are **absent**.  

- **Guess 2: SOUTH** → S(-), O(x), U(-), T(x), H(-)  
  - `S` is in the word but not in position 1.  
  - `U` is in the word but not in position 3.  
  - `H` is in the word but not in position 5.  
  - `O`, `T` are **absent**.  

- **Guess 3: LUSHY** → L(x), U(✓), S(-), H(-), Y(x)  
  - `U` is **correct and in position 2** (fixed).  
  - `S` is in the word but not in position 3.  
  - `H` is in the word but not in position 4.  
  - `L`, `Y` are **absent**.  

### Deductions:
- **Confirmed letters in the secret word**: `S`, `U`, `H`.  
- **Fixed positions**:  
  - Position 2: `U` (✓ from Guess 3).  
- **Position constraints for `S`**:  
  - Not in position 1 (from SOUTH), 3 (from LUSHY), or 4 (from RAISE).  
  - Only possible position left: **5** (since position 2 is occupied by `U`).  
  - **Conclusion: `S` must be in position 5**.  
- **Position constraints for `H`**:  
  - Not in position 4 (from LUSHY) or 5 (from SOUTH, now confirmed as `S`).  
  - Only possible positions: **1 or 3**.  
- **Absent letters**: `R`, `A`, `I`, `E`, `O`, `T`, `L`, `Y` (all marked ""x"").  
- **Remaining letters to test**: Consonants like `B`, `C`, `D`, `F`, `G`, `K`, `M`, `N`, `P`, `W`, etc. (vowels `A`, `E`, `I`, `O`, `Y` are excluded).  
- **Word structure**: `[H or new]` `U` `[H or new]` `[new]` `S`.  

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Test `H` in position 1 (since position 3 is the only alternative if this fails).  
- Introduce **new common consonants** for positions 3 and 4 (if `H` is at 1) or positions 1 and 4 (if `H` is at 3).  
- Prioritize high-frequency letters (`N`, `K`, `M`, `P`) to maximize information.  
- Avoid absent letters and respect fixed positions (`U` at 2, `S` at 5).  

### Selected Guess: **HUNKS**
- **Why this word?**  
  - `H` in position 1: Tests if `H` is in position 1 (if ✓, confirmed; if -, `H` must be in position 3).  
  - `U` in position 2: Fixed and correct (expected ✓).  
  - `N` in position 3: Tests a new common letter.  
  - `K` in position 4: Tests another new common letter.  
  - `S` in position 5: Fixed and correct (expected ✓).  
- **Benefits**:  
  - Uses distinct, untested letters (`N`, `K`).  
  - Resolves `H`'s position and tests high-frequency consonants.  
  - If `H` is not in position 1, feedback will confirm it must be in position 3 for the next guess.

<guess>HUNKS</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SOUTH -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(x) U(-) T(x) H(-)
Guess 3: LUSHY -> FEEDBACK: L(x) U(✓) S(-) H(-) Y(x)
Guess 4: HUNKS -> FEEDBACK: H(✓) U(✓) N(x) K(x) S(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE -> R(x), A(x), I(x), S(-), E(x)
  - S is present, but not in position 4.

Guess 2: SOUTH -> S(-), O(x), U(-), T(x), H(-)
  - S is present, but not in position 1.
  - U is present, but not in position 3.
  - H is present, but not in position 5.
  - O and T are absent.

Guess 3: LUSHY -> L(x), U(✓), S(-), H(-), Y(x)
  - U is correct in position 2.
  - S is present, but not in position 3.
  - H is present, but not in position 4.
  - L and Y are absent.

Guess 4: HUNKS -> H(✓), U(✓), N(x), K(x), S(✓)
  - H is correct in position 1, U in position 2, and S in position 5.
  - N and K are absent.

Now, consolidating the information:

Confirmed letters and positions:
- Position 1: H (from HUNKS, now fixed)
- Position 2: U (fixed from LUSHY)
- Position 5: S (we deduced earlier and confirmed by ✓ in HUNKS)

Since we now have H at position 1, U at position 2, and S at position 5, the word is: H U _ _ S

We need to fill positions 3 and 4.

From the feedback, we also know the absent letters: R, A, I, E, O, T, L, Y, N, K.

So the absent letters are: R, A, I, E, O, T, L, Y, N, K.

We can list the available letters: B, C, D, F, G, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. (And note that H, U, S are already placed and known.)

The word must be a valid English word of the form H U _ _ S.

We have two blanks to fill with two new letters from the available set.

Now, common letters to consider: from the available letters, we can look for frequent consonants: F, C, P, M, G, etc.

We need to think of 5-letter words starting with ""HU"" and ending with ""S"".

Some possibilities: 
- HUMPS (but M and P are available, but we haven't tested them? However, we already used HUNKS and know N and K are absent, but HUMPS uses M and P, which are untested.)
- HUBBS? Not a common word.
- HUFFS? Also, F repeated? But valid.
- HULLS? But L is absent.

Given the constraints, let's list possible words:

- HUMPS: H, U, M, P, S
- HUFFS: H, U, F, F, S
- HUGES? But E is absent -> H,U,G,E,S -> E absent, invalid.
- HUTCH: H,U,T,C,H -> T is absent and ends with H, not S? Invalid.
- HURTS: U is at position 2? But T absent and R absent? Invalid.
- HUSSY: but Y is absent and S repeated? But S repeated might be possible? However, we have no indication of multiple S's, but we already have one S at position 5. The word would have S at position 3 as well? Let's see: H,U,S,S,Y -> but Y is absent, and we don't know if two S's are allowed. But Y is absent.

So likely candidates: HUMPS, HUFFS, HUCKS? But K absent -> invalid because K is absent (from HUNKS feedback).

Also, HUMUS? But U at position 3? HUMUS: H,U,M,U,S -> U at position 2 and 4? The word has two U's? We haven't tested for duplicates. But note, secret word already has U at position 2, and if it has another U? But if we try HUMUS, position 3 is M, position 4 is U. But we don't know if U is repeated. And also, in our feedback so far, we haven't had duplicates. But to be safe, let's avoid duplicates for now.

HUMPH: ends with H, not S? Invalid.

So HUMPS and HUFFS are candidates.

But HUFFS has two F's. We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but it is a valid word.

We can test HUMPS: if we try and get feedback.

But we have only one guess left? We have used 4 guesses, so we have 2 tries left (since 6 tries total).

We are at guess 5. We can try HUMPS.

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests one of the letters without duplicates.

But HUMPS is a good candidate.

Note: In HUNKS, we tried N and K and found they are absent. So for HUMPS, we are testing M and P.

If we try HUMPS, we might solve it if it's correct.

But let's see if there are other words.

Another word: HUMUS? As above, but has two U's? HUMUS: H,U,M,U,S -> positions: H1, U2, M3, U4, S5. So U at position 4? We don't know if U is duplicated. But in previous feedback, U has been only at position 2, but the secret word might have two U's. However, in SOUTH, we had U at position 3 and got a minus, meaning U was present but not at position 3. It doesn't say if there are additional U's. So possible. But HUMUS is a food item and a valid word, but we try to avoid duplicates? Not necessarily.

But we have absent letters that constrain.

We can also note that in the word, positions 3 and 4 must be two consonants from the available set.

Now, let's think: common words ending with US that start with HU? There are not many.

Given the known absent letters, the best candidates are HUMPS and HUFFS.

But HUFFS has duplicate F, but that's acceptable.

Perhaps HUCKS? But K is absent.

HUMPS: If we get HUMPS and the secret word is that, then we win. Otherwise, we can get feedback on M and P.

Similarly, if we try HUMPS and it has a minus or x, then we know M and/or P are absent or misplaced.

But note: the word is H U _ _ S, so if we put M in position 3 and P in position 4, then we test both.

So I think HUMPS is a good guess.

But let's confirm: if the secret word is HUMPS, then we get H(✓) U(✓) M(?) P(?) S(✓). If M is correct and P is correct, we win.

If M is not in position 3, we might get a minus and know that M is in the word but not at 3? But since there are no other positions for M (only positions 3 and 4, but we are testing both), so if M is present but not at position 3, it must be at position 4? Similarly for P.

But we don't know how many letters are left to test.

We can also consider a guess that uses different letters to cover more ground. But we only have two positions left.

Alternatively, we could test a word that doesn't assume H is at position 1? But we already know H is at position 1 from HUNKS feedback (H(✓)), so position 1 is fixed as H.

So the word is definitely H U ? ? S.

No alternative.

We need to fill two positions with two letters from the available set.

Our available letters: B, C, D, F, G, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We don't need to use duplicate letters necessarily? But in words like HUFFS it's duplicated.

To maximize the chance of getting it right, we can choose the most common English word.

HUMPS meaning multiple humps? Or as a verb. It's valid.

HUFFS meaning to show annoyance.

Both are valid, but HUMPS might be more common? Or HUFFS.

Another word: HUSKS? But in HUNKS, we used N and K and they are absent? HUSKS: H,U,S,K,S -> S at position 3 and 5? But we have S at position 5 already, and we know S is present, but we don't know if duplicated. And K is absent, so invalid.

Similarly, HULKS: L and K absent.

So HUMPS or HUFFS.

Let me search for other options: HUGHS? Not common.

HUMPS seems a good bet.

Since we have two guesses, we can try HUMPS. If it's not correct, we will get feedback and use the last guess.

So let's go with HUMPS.

But note: we haven't tested M or P before, so they are fair game.

Therefore, the next guess is HUMPS.### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Review Feedback from Previous Guesses**:
   - **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: 
     - `S` is in the word but not in position 4.  
     - `R`, `A`, `I`, `E` are absent.
   - **Guess 2 (SOUTH)**: 
     - `S` is in the word but not in position 1.  
     - `U` is in the word but not in position 3.  
     - `H` is in the word but not in position 5.  
     - `O`, `T` are absent.
   - **Guess 3 (LUSHY)**: 
     - `U` is correct in position 2 (fixed).  
     - `S` is in the word but not in position 3.  
     - `H` is in the word but not in position 4.  
     - `L`, `Y` are absent.
   - **Guess 4 (HUNKS)**: 
     - `H` is correct in position 1 (fixed).  
     - `U` is correct in position 2 (reconfirmed).  
     - `S` is correct in position 5 (fixed).  
     - `N`, `K` are absent.

2. **Key Deductions**:
   - **Fixed Letters and Positions**:  
     - Position 1: `H`  
     - Position 2: `U`  
     - Position 5: `S`  
     - The word is `H U _ _ S`.
   - **Confirmed Absent Letters**: `R`, `A`, `I`, `E`, `O`, `T`, `L`, `Y`, `N`, `K` (all marked ""x"" across guesses).  
   - **Remaining Letters**: Only positions 3 and 4 are unknown, requiring two new letters from the available pool: `B`, `C`, `D`, `F`, `G`, `J`, `M`, `P`, `Q`, `V`, `W`, `X`, `Z`.  
   - **Constraints**:  
     - Position 3 and 4 must be filled with distinct or repeated letters (no duplicates have been indicated yet, but feedback doesn't rule out the possibility).

3. **Strategy for Guess 5**:  
   - Test high-frequency consonants (`M`, `P`, `F`, `G`) in positions 3 and 4 to maximize information.  
   - **Selected word: HUMPS**  
     - `H` (1), `U` (2), `M` (3), `P` (4), `S` (5).  
   - **Why HUMPS?**  
     - Tests `M` in position 3 and `P` in position 4 (both new, untested letters).  
     - If correct, this guess solves the word.  
     - If incorrect, feedback on `M` and `P` will reveal their status (✓, -, or x), leaving only one guess to deduce the final word.

But note that in the feedback, S was in position 4 and was marked as present but wrong position, so S is definitely in the word, just not at position 4.\n\nWe also know that the secret word does not contain R, A, I, or E.\n\nFor the next guess, we need to choose a 5-letter word that:\n- Includes the letter S (since we know it\'s in the word) but not in the 4th position (because we already tried that and it was wrong).\n- Avoids the letters R, A, I, E (since they are not in the word).\n- We want to test other common letters to get more information.\n\nWe have 6 tries, so we can use this guess to narrow down the position of S and also test new letters.\n\nPossible positions for S: 1, 2, 3, 5.\n\nWe should also try to include other common consonants and vowels that we haven\'t tried. Since we know the word has S, and we have eliminated R, A, I, E, the remaining vowels are O, U and sometimes Y. Consonants we haven\'t tried include T, N, L, C, D, H, etc.\n\nA good strategy is to pick a word that has S in a different position and uses new letters to cover more ground.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have S and avoid R, A, I, E.\n\nFor example, we can try S in the first position: words like ""SOUTH"", ""SONIC"", ""SOLID"", etc.\n\nBut note: we also want to test other common letters. Since we have only one confirmed letter (S) and four new positions to test, we should choose a word with as many new common letters as possible.\n\nAlternatively, we can try S in the second position: words like ""USUAL"" (but U is repeated and we have A which is eliminated? Wait, A is eliminated so we cannot use A). We must avoid A.\n\nLet me list some candidate words:\n\n- S in position 1: \n  - S with O: ""SOLAR"" (but has A and R, which are eliminated) -> invalid.\n  - ""SONLY"" (not a word) \n  - ""SONGS"" (has S repeated, and we don\'t know if S is repeated, but it\'s acceptable; however, we are avoiding A, R, I, E, so this is okay? But S is repeated and we don\'t know if the word has two S\'s. Also, we are trying to get new letters. ""SONGS"" has O, N, G, S. But S is at position 1 and 5. We know S is in the word, but we don\'t know if it\'s repeated. We can try, but maybe not the best because we are repeating S and we might not get information about other letters.\n\nWe want to use distinct letters if possible to maximize information.\n\nSo, let\'s try to find a word with S in position 1 and four new distinct letters that are not R, A, I, E.\n\nPossible words: \n- ""SOUTH"" -> S, O, U, T, H. All distinct and new. This is a good candidate.\n- ""SHOWN"" -> S, H, O, W, N. Also good.\n- ""SLUNG"" -> S, L, U, N, G. Good.\n\nBut note: we have eliminated E, so we don\'t have to worry about that.\n\nAlternatively, S in position 2: \n- Words like ""USHER"" (has E and R, eliminated) -> invalid.\n- ""PSYCH"" (not 5 letters? ""PSYCH"" is not a word, but ""PSYCH"" is a root, not a word. We need valid words.)\n- ""MUSTY"" -> M, U, S, T, Y. S is in position 3? Let\'s see: M (1), U (2), S (3), T (4), Y (5). So if we put S in position 3, that\'s a new position. But we want to test S in a position we haven\'t tried? We only tried position 4 so far. So positions 1,2,3,5 are available.\n\nWe can try S in position 3? But in the first guess, we had S in position 4 and it was misplaced. So we know S is in the word but not at position 4. We can try any of 1,2,3,5.\n\nBut to maximize information, we might want to try a position that is common for S, such as the beginning or the end.\n\nAnother candidate: S in position 5: \n- Words like ""FOCUS"" -> F, O, C, U, S. S at the end. This is good because we test S at position 5 and new letters.\n\nBut note: we also want to cover more common letters. The most common consonants in English are T, N, S, L, R (but R is eliminated), so T, N, L are good to test.\n\nAlso, vowels: we have only tested A, I, E and they are out. So we should test O and U.\n\nTherefore, a word that includes S (not in position 4) and also includes T, N, L, O, U, etc.\n\nLet me think of a word that has S and T, for example.\n\nOne classic second guess after getting one letter is to try a word that places the known letter in a different position and uses new common letters.\n\nI think ""SOUTH"" is a strong candidate: \n- S at position 1 (new position)\n- O, U, T, H: all new and common.\n\nAnother candidate: ""SHUNT"" -> S, H, U, N, T. S at position 1, and we test H, U, N, T.\n\nBut ""SOUTH"" is more common.\n\nAlternatively, ""STOMP"" -> S, T, O, M, P. But we have S at 1 and T at 2.\n\nBut we don\'t know if the word has T or not.\n\nWe can also consider ""LUSTY"" -> L, U, S, T, Y. S at position 3. This tests L, U, S (at 3), T, Y.\n\nBut we are testing S at position 3, which is a new position.\n\nI think ""SOUTH"" is a good choice because:\n- It places S at position 1 (we haven\'t tried S at 1)\n- It tests O, U, T, H which are common and we haven\'t tried them.\n\nSo, let\'s go with ""SOUTH"".\n\nBut note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""SOUTH"" is a valid English word.\n\nTherefore, the next guess is ""SOUTH"".\n\nWe\'ll see if S is at position 1 (if we get a check) or if it\'s elsewhere (if we get a minus). Also, we\'ll get information about O, U, T, H.\n\nIf S is not at position 1, we might get a minus for S, meaning it\'s in the word but not at 1, and then we know it must be at 2,3, or 5 (since 4 is already tried and we know it\'s not there).\n\nBut we are trying position 1 now.\n\nSo, I think ""SOUTH"" is a good second guess.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R, A, I, E are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- S is in the secret word but **not in the 4th position** (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- The word must include **S** (since it\'s confirmed in the secret word) but avoid placing it in the 4th position again.\n- It should exclude R, A, I, E (as they are absent from the secret word).\n- To maximize information, the guess should test new common letters (e.g., O, U, T, H, N, L) and position S in a new location (e.g., position 1, 2, 3, or 5).\n\nA strong candidate is **""SOUTH""**:\n- Places S in position 1 (a new position to test).\n- Introduces new common letters: O, U, T, H.\n- Avoids R, A, I, E and uses distinct letters for efficient feedback.\n\n<guess>SOUTH</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: SOUTH -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(x) U(-) T(x) H(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Alright, let me figure this out step by step.

Feedback said U was not in pos 3, but pos2 is okay\n- Pos3 S - S can be in pos3 (since not 1 or 4)\n- Pos4 H - H can be in pos4 (since not 5)\n- Pos1 L (new letter)\n- Pos5 Y (new letter)\n\nConstraints satisfied:\n- S is in pos3 (allowed)\n- U in pos2 (not pos3, good)\n- H in pos4 (not pos5, good)\nNo R,A,I,E,O,T used\n\nThis looks promising. Another option could be ""MUSHY"" but contains M instead of L.\n\nBoth test two new consonants. Since L is slightly more common than M, ""LUSHY"" might be slightly better for information gain. Also ""Y"" at the end might be less common but worth including.\n\nSo ""LUSHY"" seems like a strong candidate - it places all known letters in new valid positions and tests L and Y for the remaining spots.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n### Key Information from Feedback:\n1. **From RAISE (Guess 1):**  \n   - `R`, `A`, `I`, `E` are **not in the word** (all ""x"").  \n   - `S` is in the word but **not in position 4** (marked ""-"").\n\n2. **From SOUTH (Guess 2):**  \n   - `S` is in the word but **not in position 1** (marked ""-"").  \n   - `O` and `T` are **not in the word** (both ""x"").  \n   - `U` is in the word but **not in position 3** (marked ""-"").  \n   - `H` is in the word but **not in position 5** (marked ""-"").\n\n### Deductions:\n- **Confirmed letters in the secret word**: `S`, `U`, `H`.  \n- **Confirmed absent letters**: `R`, `A`, `I`, `E`, `O`, `T`.  \n- **Position constraints**:  \n  - `S` must be in **position 2 or 3** (since it is not in 1 or 4).  \n  - `U` cannot be in position 3.  \n  - `H` cannot be in position 5.  \n- **Remaining vowel/consonant options**: The word excludes common vowels like `A`, `E`, `I`, `O`, so `U` (already confirmed) is the primary vowel. Consonants like `L`, `N`, `M`, `Y`, `P`, `B`, or `C` are candidates for testing.  \n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- The guess must include `S`, `U`, and `H` while adhering to position constraints.  \n- Place `S` in position 2 or 3 to test its correct location.  \n- Place `U` and `H` in new positions (e.g., not position 3 for `U`, not position 5 for `H`).  \n- Test **two new letters** to maximize information (e.g., `L` and `Y`).  \n- Avoid absent letters (`R`, `A`, `I`, `E`, `O`, `T`).  \n\n### Selected Guess: **LUSHY**\n- **Why this word?**  \n  - `L` (position 1): Tests a new common letter.  \n  - `U` (position 2): Valid position (not position 3).  \n  - `S` (position 3): Tests a new location for `S` (allowed by constraints).  \n  - `H` (position 4): Valid position (not position 5).  \n  - `Y` (position 5): Tests a less common letter.  \n- This word respects all constraints, uses confirmed letters (`S`, `U`, `H`) in new positions, and tests two untried letters (`L` and `Y`).\n\n<guess>LUSHY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: SOUTH -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(x) U(-) T(x) H(-)\nGuess 3: LUSHY -> FEEDBACK: L(x) U(✓) S(-) H(-) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: RAISE -> R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)\n  - This means: S is in the word but not in position 4.

From guess1: not in 4, guess2: not in 1, guess3: not in 3. So S must be in position 2 or 5? But wait, position 2 is already taken by U (which is fixed). Therefore, S must be in position 5? Let\'s see:\n\nPositions: 1,2,3,4,5\n\nWe know:\n- S cannot be in 1 (from SOUTH)\n- S cannot be in 3 (from LUSHY)\n- S cannot be in 4 (from RAISE)\n\nSo the only positions left are 2 and 5. But position 2 is occupied by U (which is fixed and correct). Therefore, S cannot be in position 2 because that would require two letters in the same position? No, the word has 5 distinct positions. We have U fixed at position 2, so S must be in position 5.\n\nBut wait, we don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters. However, in the feedback, we have not seen any indication of duplicate letters. But it\'s possible. However, let\'s see:\n\nIn the feedback for LUSHY, we have U at position 2 correct, and S at position 3 is present but wrong position. That means S is in the word but not at 3. It doesn\'t say anything about having two S\'s. But in the secret word, if S is at position 5, then in LUSHY we have S at position 3 which is wrong, but the S at position 5 is not represented in the guess LUSHY? No, LUSHY has S only at position 3. So if the secret word has S at position 5, then in LUSHY we have no S at position 5, so the feedback for S would still be that it is present (because there is an S in the word) but not at position 3. So that is consistent.\n\nBut we also have H at position 4 in LUSHY and it was marked as present but wrong position. So H is in the word but not at position 4.\n\nNow, what about position 5? We haven\'t tested position 5 for S yet. But from the constraints, S must be in position 2 or 5. But position 2 is taken by U, so if the word has only one S, then S must be at 5. But what if the word has two S\'s? Then S could be at 2 and 5? But position 2 is U, which is fixed and correct, so if S were at position 2, then we would have two different letters at the same position? That\'s impossible. Therefore, the secret word cannot have S at position 2 because position 2 is U. Therefore, S must be at position 5.\n\nSo we can conclude: S is at position 5.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check:\n\n- In guess1: RAISE had S at position 4 -> not there.\n- In guess2: SOUTH had S at position 1 -> not there.\n- In guess3: LUSHY had S at position 3 -> not there.\n\nSo the only position left is 5. And position 2 is taken by U, so S must be at 5.\n\nTherefore, we have:\nPosition 2: U (fixed)\nPosition 5: S (must be)\n\nNow, we also have H in the word. From LUSHY, H was at position 4 and we got a minus, so H is not at position 4. From SOUTH, H was at position 5 and we got a minus, but now we know position 5 is S, so that\'s consistent. So H must be in position 1 or 3? Because positions 2 and 5 are taken by U and S.\n\nPositions available: 1, 3, 4.\n\nBut H cannot be at position 4 (from LUSHY feedback) and cannot be at position 5 (from SOUTH, but now we know position 5 is S). So H must be at position 1 or 3.\n\nSimilarly, we have to fill positions 1, 3, and 4 with H and two other letters? But we know H is one of them, and we have two more letters to find.\n\nWe also know the absent letters: R, A, I, E, O, T, L, Y (from the x\'s in the feedback). So absent letters: R, A, I, E, O, T, L, Y.\n\nTherefore, the remaining letters must be from the alphabet excluding these.\n\nAlphabet: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (and possibly H, but H is already known to be present, but we are considering the two other letters).\n\nBut note: we have three positions to fill (1,3,4) and we know one of them is H (but we don\'t know which one). So we need to find two more letters.\n\nWe also have the feedback that H is not at position 4, so H is either at 1 or 3.\n\nNow, for the next guess, we want to try to find the position of H and the other two letters.\n\nWe know the word has the form: _ U _ _ S\n\nAnd the first blank is either H or a new letter, the third blank is either H or a new letter, and the fourth blank is a new letter (since H cannot be at 4).\n\nBut we have three positions: 1, 3, 4. One of them is H (at 1 or 3) and the other two are new letters.\n\nWe can try to form a word that fits this pattern and tests possible letters.\n\nBut we have to avoid the absent letters.\n\nLet me list the known constraints:\n\n- Position 2: U (fixed)\n- Position 5: S (fixed)\n- Position 1: either H or a new letter (from the set of available letters)\n- Position 3: either H or a new letter (but if H is at 1, then position 3 is a new letter, and if H is at 3, then position 1 is a new letter)\n- Position 4: must be a new letter (since H cannot be at 4)\n\nAnd the word must be a valid English word.\n\nWe also know that H is present and must be at 1 or 3.\n\nNow, for the next guess, we can try to test the position of H and also test some common letters for the other positions.\n\nBut we have limited letters left to choose from. The available letters (consonants and vowels) are: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. Note that U is already used and is the only vowel we have? But we don\'t know if there are other vowels. The vowels we have excluded are A, E, I, O. So the only vowel left is U (which we have) and sometimes Y, but Y is excluded. So the word might not have any other vowel. It could be that the other letters are consonants.\n\nSo we are looking for a word of the form: [letter1] U [letter3] [letter4] S\n\nWith letter1 and letter3: one of them is H, the other is a consonant from the available set.\n\nAnd letter4 is a consonant from the available set.\n\nWe can try to guess a word that has H in position 1, and then two new letters for 3 and 4. Or H in position 3 and new letters for 1 and 4.\n\nBut we don\'t know which, so we might need to test.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has H in position 1 and then common consonants for 3 and 4, and see the feedback.\n\nBut we have to make sure the word is valid.\n\nLet me think of words that end with US and have H in the word.\n\nSince we know the last two letters are _ S, and the second letter is U, so the last two are US. So the word ends with US.\n\nWe need a word of the form: ? U ? ? S\n\nWith H in position 1 or 3.\n\nPossible words:\n\nIf H is at position 1: H U ? ? S\n\nExamples: HUSKS, HUNKS, HUFFS, HUMPH (but 5 letters? HUMPH is 5 letters: H,U,M,P,H -> but H at 1 and 5, but we have S at 5? No, position 5 is S, so it must end with S, not H. So HUMPH ends with H, not S. So invalid.\n\nHUMPS: H,U,M,P,S -> that\'s 5 letters: positions: H(1),U(2),M(3),P(4),S(5). This is a valid word.\n\nSimilarly, HUNKS: H,U,N,K,S.\n\nHULLS: H,U,L,L,S -> but L is excluded (from LUSHY feedback: L(x)), so we cannot use L.\n\nBut L is excluded, so we avoid L.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot use Y, etc.\n\nSo HUMPS: uses M and P, which are available.\n\nHUNKS: uses N and K, available.\n\nIf H is at position 3: then the word is ? U H ? S\n\nExamples: BUHLS (not a word), MUHLS (not common), but we need valid words.\n\nMore common: SUHUS? Not a word. DUHAS? Not a word.\n\nPerhaps: ACHUS? But A is excluded.\n\nWe need to find words that are valid and avoid excluded letters.\n\nList of possible words:\n\nOption 1: H at 1: \n- HUMPS (H, U, M, P, S) -> M and P are new.\n- HUNKS (H, U, N, K, S) -> N and K.\n- HUFFS (H, U, F, F, S) -> but F repeated? And we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. But we can try, but it\'s a valid word.\n\nOption 2: H at 3:\n- We need words like ? U H ? S\n  Examples: \n  - MUCHS? Not a word.\n  - BUGHS? Not a word.\n  - DUMPS? D,U,M,P,S -> but H is not in this word? We need H at position 3. DUMPS has no H.\n  - We need the third letter to be H.\n  - Words: SUHUS? Not valid.\n  - Perhaps: ACHES? But A and E excluded.\n  - NUHUS? Not a word.\n\nIt seems difficult to find a word with H at position 3 and ending with US.\n\nAnother one: LUGHS? L is excluded, and it ends with HS, not S? LUGHS is L,U,G,H,S -> that\'s 5 letters: positions: L(1),U(2),G(3),H(4),S(5). But in this case, H is at position 4, but we know H cannot be at position 4 (from LUSHY feedback: H at position 4 was marked as present but wrong position, meaning it is not at 4). So H cannot be at 4. Therefore, we cannot have a word with H at 4.\n\nSo for H at position 3, we need a word: ? U H ? S\n\nThe fourth position must be a letter that is not H and not excluded.\n\nExamples: \n- BUGHS: B,U,G,H,S -> but that\'s H at position 4? No: B(1), U(2), G(3), H(4), S(5). But H at 4 is not allowed.\n- We need the third letter to be H and the fourth to be something else.\n\nSo: ? U H X S\n\nWhat words are there? \n- DUCHS? Not a word.\n- PUMAS? But P,U,M,A,S -> A is excluded and no H.\n- Perhaps: HUHUS? Not a word.\n\nI think it\'s hard to find a common word with H at position 3 and ending with US. So maybe H is more likely at position 1.\n\nTherefore, we can try a word with H at position 1 and two new letters.\n\nFor example, HUMPS or HUNKS.\n\nBut we also have to consider that in the feedback, we have not tested many letters. We have tested: R,A,I,E,O,T,L,Y and they are absent. So we have many letters left.\n\nBut we can try HUMPS: H U M P S\n\nThis would test:\n- H at position 1: if it\'s correct, we get a check. If not, then H must be at position 3 (and we get a minus or if absent then we have a problem, but we know H is present so we would get a minus if not at 1).\n- M at position 3: if present, we get feedback.\n- P at position 4: if present, we get feedback.\n\nBut note: we are also testing the letter M and P.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to test more common letters. For example, N is more common than M and P? But both are reasonable.\n\nAnother word: HUSKS? H U S K S -> but S is repeated. We have S at position 1? No, H at 1, U at 2, S at 3, K at 4, S at 5. But we already know S is at 5, so if we put S at 3, that would be a duplicate. But we don\'t know if the word has two S\'s. However, in the feedback so far, we have not had any duplicate, but it\'s possible. But to avoid complexity, we might avoid duplicates for now.\n\nIn HUMPS, we don\'t have duplicates.\n\nSimilarly, HUNKS: H U N K S -> no duplicates.\n\nBut in HUNKS, we have K at position 4 and S at 5.\n\nWe can choose one.\n\nBut we also have the possibility that H is at position 3. If we try HUMPS and H is actually at position 3, then in HUMPS we would have H at position 1 which is wrong, so we would get a minus for H (meaning it\'s present but not at 1) and then we know H must be at 3. And then we would also get feedback on M and P.\n\nSo that\'s acceptable.\n\nSimilarly, if we try a word that has H at position 3, but as we saw, it\'s hard to find a common word.\n\nAnother word: what about ""PUSHY""? But we already tried LUSHY and Y is excluded, and PUSHY has P,U,S,H,Y. But Y is excluded and we know that. Also, in PUSHY, S is at position 3, which we know is not correct (from LUSHY feedback, S is not at 3). And we know position 5 is S, so PUSHY has S at 3 and no S at 5? But we have to have S at 5, so PUSHY would have S at 3 and the secret word has S at 5, so the feedback for S would be minus (because it\'s present but not at 3) and we already know that. But we also have H at position 4, which we know is not allowed (H cannot be at 4). So PUSHY is invalid because it places H at 4.\n\nSo not good.\n\nTherefore, I think trying a word with H at position 1 is the way to go.\n\nSo let\'s choose between HUMPS and HUNKS.\n\nHUMPS: H, U, M, P, S\nHUNKS: H, U, N, K, S\n\nBoth are valid. We can choose one that uses more common letters.\n\nN is more common than M and P? In English, N is very common.\n\nBut we are testing two letters. Let\'s see the frequency: N is more common than K, and M and P are both common.\n\nBut we can choose HUNKS because N is a very common letter.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that tests even more common letters. What about CHUMS? But C is available. CHUMS: C,H,U,M,S -> but H is at position 2? No: C(1),H(2),U(3),M(4),S(5). But we need U at position 2, so that doesn\'t fit.\n\nWe must have U at position 2 and S at position 5.\n\nSo the word must be: ? U ? ? S\n\nWith H at 1 or 3.\n\nSo HUNKS: H at 1, U at 2, N at 3, K at 4, S at 5.\n\nHUMPS: H at 1, U at 2, M at 3, P at 4, S at 5.\n\nAnother word: FUMES? But E is excluded.\n\nBUMFS? Not a word.\n\nSo I think HUNKS or HUMPS are good.\n\nI\'ll go with HUNKS because it uses N and K, which are common.\n\nBut we have not tested N or K before.\n\nSo let\'s guess HUNKS.\n\nBut note: if H is not at position 1, then we will get a minus for H, meaning it is present but not at 1, so it must be at position 3. Then we would know that for the next guess.\n\nSimilarly, we get feedback on N and K.\n\nSo it\'s a good test.\n\nTherefore, the next guess is HUNKS.### Analysis of Previous Feedback\n\nFrom the feedback history:\n- **Guess 1: RAISE** → R(x), A(x), I(x), S(-), E(x)  \n  - `S` is in the word but not in position 4.  \n  - `R`, `A`, `I`, `E` are **absent**.  \n\n- **Guess 2: SOUTH** → S(-), O(x), U(-), T(x), H(-)  \n  - `S` is in the word but not in position 1.  \n  - `U` is in the word but not in position 3.  \n  - `H` is in the word but not in position 5.  \n  - `O`, `T` are **absent**.  \n\n- **Guess 3: LUSHY** → L(x), U(✓), S(-), H(-), Y(x)  \n  - `U` is **correct and in position 2** (fixed).  \n  - `S` is in the word but not in position 3.  \n  - `H` is in the word but not in position 4.  \n  - `L`, `Y` are **absent**.  \n\n### Deductions:\n- **Confirmed letters in the secret word**: `S`, `U`, `H`.  \n- **Fixed positions**:  \n  - Position 2: `U` (✓ from Guess 3).  \n- **Position constraints for `S`**:  \n  - Not in position 1 (from SOUTH), 3 (from LUSHY), or 4 (from RAISE).  \n  - Only possible position left: **5** (since position 2 is occupied by `U`).  \n  - **Conclusion: `S` must be in position 5**.  \n- **Position constraints for `H`**:  \n  - Not in position 4 (from LUSHY) or 5 (from SOUTH, now confirmed as `S`).  \n  - Only possible positions: **1 or 3**.  \n- **Absent letters**: `R`, `A`, `I`, `E`, `O`, `T`, `L`, `Y` (all marked ""x"").  \n- **Remaining letters to test**: Consonants like `B`, `C`, `D`, `F`, `G`, `K`, `M`, `N`, `P`, `W`, etc. (vowels `A`, `E`, `I`, `O`, `Y` are excluded).  \n- **Word structure**: `[H or new]` `U` `[H or new]` `[new]` `S`.  \n\n### Strategy for Guess 4:\n- Test `H` in position 1 (since position 3 is the only alternative if this fails).  \n- Introduce **new common consonants** for positions 3 and 4 (if `H` is at 1) or positions 1 and 4 (if `H` is at 3).  \n- Prioritize high-frequency letters (`N`, `K`, `M`, `P`) to maximize information.  \n- Avoid absent letters and respect fixed positions (`U` at 2, `S` at 5).  \n\n### Selected Guess: **HUNKS**\n- **Why this word?**  \n  - `H` in position 1: Tests if `H` is in position 1 (if ✓, confirmed; if -, `H` must be in position 3).  \n  - `U` in position 2: Fixed and correct (expected ✓).  \n  - `N` in position 3: Tests a new common letter.  \n  - `K` in position 4: Tests another new common letter.  \n  - `S` in position 5: Fixed and correct (expected ✓).  \n- **Benefits**:  \n  - Uses distinct, untested letters (`N`, `K`).  \n  - Resolves `H`\'s position and tests high-frequency consonants.  \n  - If `H` is not in position 1, feedback will confirm it must be in position 3 for the next guess.\n\n<guess>HUNKS</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: SOUTH -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(x) U(-) T(x) H(-)\nGuess 3: LUSHY -> FEEDBACK: L(x) U(✓) S(-) H(-) Y(x)\nGuess 4: HUNKS -> FEEDBACK: H(✓) U(✓) N(x) K(x) S(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from four guesses:\n\nGuess 1: RAISE -> R(x), A(x), I(x), S(-), E(x)\n  - S is present, but not in position 4.\n\nGuess 2: SOUTH -> S(-), O(x), U(-), T(x), H(-)\n  - S is present, but not in position 1.\n  - U is present, but not in position 3.\n  - H is present, but not in position 5.\n  - O and T are absent.\n\nGuess 3: LUSHY -> L(x), U(✓), S(-), H(-), Y(x)\n  - U is correct in position 2.\n  - S is present, but not in position 3.\n  - H is present, but not in position 4.\n  - L and Y are absent.\n\nGuess 4: HUNKS -> H(✓), U(✓), N(x), K(x), S(✓)\n  - H is correct in position 1, U in position 2, and S in position 5.\n  - N and K are absent.\n\nNow, consolidating the information:\n\nConfirmed letters and positions:\n- Position 1: H (from HUNKS, now fixed)\n- Position 2: U (fixed from LUSHY)\n- Position 5: S (we deduced earlier and confirmed by ✓ in HUNKS)\n\nSince we now have H at position 1, U at position 2, and S at position 5, the word is: H U _ _ S\n\nWe need to fill positions 3 and 4.\n\nFrom the feedback, we also know the absent letters: R, A, I, E, O, T, L, Y, N, K.\n\nSo the absent letters are: R, A, I, E, O, T, L, Y, N, K.\n\nWe can list the available letters: B, C, D, F, G, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. (And note that H, U, S are already placed and known.)\n\nThe word must be a valid English word of the form H U _ _ S.\n\nWe have two blanks to fill with two new letters from the available set.\n\nNow, common letters to consider: from the available letters, we can look for frequent consonants: F, C, P, M, G, etc.\n\nWe need to think of 5-letter words starting with ""HU"" and ending with ""S"".\n\nSome possibilities: \n- HUMPS (but M and P are available, but we haven\'t tested them? However, we already used HUNKS and know N and K are absent, but HUMPS uses M and P, which are untested.)\n- HUBBS? Not a common word.\n- HUFFS? Also, F repeated? But valid.\n- HULLS? But L is absent.\n\nGiven the constraints, let\'s list possible words:\n\n- HUMPS: H, U, M, P, S\n- HUFFS: H, U, F, F, S\n- HUGES? But E is absent -> H,U,G,E,S -> E absent, invalid.\n- HUTCH: H,U,T,C,H -> T is absent and ends with H, not S? Invalid.\n- HURTS: U is at position 2? But T absent and R absent? Invalid.\n- HUSSY: but Y is absent and S repeated? But S repeated might be possible? However, we have no indication of multiple S\'s, but we already have one S at position 5. The word would have S at position 3 as well? Let\'s see: H,U,S,S,Y -> but Y is absent, and we don\'t know if two S\'s are allowed. But Y is absent.\n\nSo likely candidates: HUMPS, HUFFS, HUCKS? But K absent -> invalid because K is absent (from HUNKS feedback).\n\nAlso, HUMUS? But U at position 3? HUMUS: H,U,M,U,S -> U at position 2 and 4? The word has two U\'s? We haven\'t tested for duplicates. But note, secret word already has U at position 2, and if it has another U? But if we try HUMUS, position 3 is M, position 4 is U. But we don\'t know if U is repeated. And also, in our feedback so far, we haven\'t had duplicates. But to be safe, let\'s avoid duplicates for now.\n\nHUMPH: ends with H, not S? Invalid.\n\nSo HUMPS and HUFFS are candidates.\n\nBut HUFFS has two F\'s. We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed, but it is a valid word.\n\nWe can test HUMPS: if we try and get feedback.\n\nBut we have only one guess left? We have used 4 guesses, so we have 2 tries left (since 6 tries total).\n\nWe are at guess 5. We can try HUMPS.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that tests one of the letters without duplicates.\n\nBut HUMPS is a good candidate.\n\nNote: In HUNKS, we tried N and K and found they are absent. So for HUMPS, we are testing M and P.\n\nIf we try HUMPS, we might solve it if it\'s correct.\n\nBut let\'s see if there are other words.\n\nAnother word: HUMUS? As above, but has two U\'s? HUMUS: H,U,M,U,S -> positions: H1, U2, M3, U4, S5. So U at position 4? We don\'t know if U is duplicated. But in previous feedback, U has been only at position 2, but the secret word might have two U\'s. However, in SOUTH, we had U at position 3 and got a minus, meaning U was present but not at position 3. It doesn\'t say if there are additional U\'s. So possible. But HUMUS is a food item and a valid word, but we try to avoid duplicates? Not necessarily.\n\nBut we have absent letters that constrain.\n\nWe can also note that in the word, positions 3 and 4 must be two consonants from the available set.\n\nNow, let\'s think: common words ending with US that start with HU? There are not many.\n\nGiven the known absent letters, the best candidates are HUMPS and HUFFS.\n\nBut HUFFS has duplicate F, but that\'s acceptable.\n\nPerhaps HUCKS? But K is absent.\n\nHUMPS: If we get HUMPS and the secret word is that, then we win. Otherwise, we can get feedback on M and P.\n\nSimilarly, if we try HUMPS and it has a minus or x, then we know M and/or P are absent or misplaced.\n\nBut note: the word is H U _ _ S, so if we put M in position 3 and P in position 4, then we test both.\n\nSo I think HUMPS is a good guess.\n\nBut let\'s confirm: if the secret word is HUMPS, then we get H(✓) U(✓) M(?) P(?) S(✓). If M is correct and P is correct, we win.\n\nIf M is not in position 3, we might get a minus and know that M is in the word but not at 3? But since there are no other positions for M (only positions 3 and 4, but we are testing both), so if M is present but not at position 3, it must be at position 4? Similarly for P.\n\nBut we don\'t know how many letters are left to test.\n\nWe can also consider a guess that uses different letters to cover more ground. But we only have two positions left.\n\nAlternatively, we could test a word that doesn\'t assume H is at position 1? But we already know H is at position 1 from HUNKS feedback (H(✓)), so position 1 is fixed as H.\n\nSo the word is definitely H U ? ? S.\n\nNo alternative.\n\nWe need to fill two positions with two letters from the available set.\n\nOur available letters: B, C, D, F, G, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.\n\nWe don\'t need to use duplicate letters necessarily? But in words like HUFFS it\'s duplicated.\n\nTo maximize the chance of getting it right, we can choose the most common English word.\n\nHUMPS meaning multiple humps? Or as a verb. It\'s valid.\n\nHUFFS meaning to show annoyance.\n\nBoth are valid, but HUMPS might be more common? Or HUFFS.\n\nAnother word: HUSKS? But in HUNKS, we used N and K and they are absent? HUSKS: H,U,S,K,S -> S at position 3 and 5? But we have S at position 5 already, and we know S is present, but we don\'t know if duplicated. And K is absent, so invalid.\n\nSimilarly, HULKS: L and K absent.\n\nSo HUMPS or HUFFS.\n\nLet me search for other options: HUGHS? Not common.\n\nHUMPS seems a good bet.\n\nSince we have two guesses, we can try HUMPS. If it\'s not correct, we will get feedback and use the last guess.\n\nSo let\'s go with HUMPS.\n\nBut note: we haven\'t tested M or P before, so they are fair game.\n\nTherefore, the next guess is HUMPS.### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Review Feedback from Previous Guesses**:\n   - **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: \n     - `S` is in the word but not in position 4.  \n     - `R`, `A`, `I`, `E` are absent.\n   - **Guess 2 (SOUTH)**: \n     - `S` is in the word but not in position 1.  \n     - `U` is in the word but not in position 3.  \n     - `H` is in the word but not in position 5.  \n     - `O`, `T` are absent.\n   - **Guess 3 (LUSHY)**: \n     - `U` is correct in position 2 (fixed).  \n     - `S` is in the word but not in position 3.  \n     - `H` is in the word but not in position 4.  \n     - `L`, `Y` are absent.\n   - **Guess 4 (HUNKS)**: \n     - `H` is correct in position 1 (fixed).  \n     - `U` is correct in position 2 (reconfirmed).  \n     - `S` is correct in position 5 (fixed).  \n     - `N`, `K` are absent.\n\n2. **Key Deductions**:\n   - **Fixed Letters and Positions**:  \n     - Position 1: `H`  \n     - Position 2: `U`  \n     - Position 5: `S`  \n     - The word is `H U _ _ S`.\n   - **Confirmed Absent Letters**: `R`, `A`, `I`, `E`, `O`, `T`, `L`, `Y`, `N`, `K` (all marked ""x"" across guesses).  \n   - **Remaining Letters**: Only positions 3 and 4 are unknown, requiring two new letters from the available pool: `B`, `C`, `D`, `F`, `G`, `J`, `M`, `P`, `Q`, `V`, `W`, `X`, `Z`.  \n   - **Constraints**:  \n     - Position 3 and 4 must be filled with distinct or repeated letters (no duplicates have been indicated yet, but feedback doesn\'t rule out the possibility).\n\n3. **Strategy for Guess 5**:  \n   - Test high-frequency consonants (`M`, `P`, `F`, `G`) in positions 3 and 4 to maximize information.  \n   - **Selected word: HUMPS**  \n     - `H` (1), `U` (2), `M` (3), `P` (4), `S` (5).  \n   - **Why HUMPS?**  \n     - Tests `M` in position 3 and `P` in position 4 (both new, untested letters).  \n     - If correct, this guess solves the word.  \n     - If incorrect, feedback on `M` and `P` will reveal their status (✓, -, or x), leaving only one guess to deduce the final word.\n\n<guess>HUMPS</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: SOUTH -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(x) U(-) T(x) H(-)\nGuess 3: LUSHY -> FEEDBACK: L(x) U(✓) S(-) H(-) Y(x)\nGuess 4: HUNKS -> FEEDBACK: H(✓) U(✓) N(x) K(x) S(✓)\nGuess 5: HUMPS -> FEEDBACK: H(✓) U(✓) M(✓) P(x) S(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given the following feedback from previous guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE -> R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)
  - S is in the word but not in position 4.

Guess 2: SOUTH -> S(-) O(x) U(-) T(x) H(-)
  - S is in the word but not in position 1.
  - U is in the word but not in position 3.
  - H is in the word but not in position 5.
  - O and T are not in the word.

Guess 3: LUSHY -> L(x) U(✓) S(-) H(-) Y(x)
  - U is correct in position 2.
  - S is in the word but not in position 3.
  - H is in the word but not in position 4.
  - L and Y are not in the word.

Guess 4: HUNKS -> H(✓) U(✓) N(x) K(x) S(✓)
  - H is correct in position 1.
  - U is correct in position 2.
  - S is in position 5? Wait, feedback says S(✓) which means it's correct in the position it was guessed, which was position 5? In HUNKS: positions are H(1), U(2), N(3), K(4), S(5). So S is correct at position 5.
  - N and K are not in the word.

Guess 5: HUMPS -> H(✓) U(✓) M(✓) P(x) S(✓)
  - H correct at position 1.
  - U correct at position 2.
  - M is correct at position 3? HUMPS: positions H(1), U(2), M(3), P(4), S(5). So M is correct at position 3? Feedback says M(✓) so yes.
  - S correct at position 5.
  - P at position 4 is not in the word? Feedback P(x) means P is not in the word at all.

So now, we know:
- The word is H U M ? S  (since positions 1,2,3,5 are fixed: H at 1, U at 2, M at 3, S at 5)
- Only position 4 is missing.
- We have P is not in the word? No: P(x) means P is not in the word at all. So the missing letter at position 4 is not P.

From the feedback, we also know the absent letters:
- From Guess1: R, A, I, E
- From Guess2: O, T
- From Guess3: L, Y
- From Guess4: N, K
- From Guess5: P is absent? Feedback: P(x) -> P not in the word.

So absent letters: R, A, I, E, O, T, L, Y, N, K, P.

Now, we need to find a letter for position 4 that is not in the absent list and is a valid English letter.

The word is H U M ? S.

We know the letter must be from the English alphabet excluding the absent letters.

Available letters: B, C, D, F, G, J, M? Wait M is already used at position 3, but could there be duplicate? In this case, the feedback has not indicated duplicates, but we should note that M is already in the word at position 3. So position 4 might be a different letter.

What about M? Could the secret word have M at position 3 and also another M? But the feedback for HUMPS: M in position 3 is correct (✓), but we don't see feedback for M elsewhere. However, we are only guessing one M. If there were another M, we wouldn't know. But let's not assume duplicate yet.

But the missing letter in position 4 is not P, and not any of the absent ones.

So available letters: B, C, D, F, G, J, Q, V, W, X, Z. And note that M, H, U, S are already used but we don't know about duplicates.

But we can try to find a common word that fits H U M _ S.

Possible letters: think of common English words.

Examples: 
- HUMUS? But U is at position 2 and 4? HUMUS: H,U,M,U,S -> so position 4 is U? But we have U already? And absent letters? We don't have U as absent, but U is in the word. Could there be two U's? Also, HUMUS has U at position 4? But in SOUTH, we had U at position 3 and it was minus, meaning present but wrong position? If U is also in position 4, that wasn't tested? But HUMUS is a valid word.

However, in the feedback for HUMPS, we did not get any indication about U, but since U was at position 2 and correct, if there were U at position 4, then in HUMPS we didn't put U at position 4? So no feedback for that. Similarly, M is at position 3 and correct, so position 4 is the only missing.

But let's see: in HUMPS we put P at position 4 and got P(x), meaning P is absent entirely. So the secret word has no P.

Now, HUMUS: H,U,M,U,S -> positions: H(1), U(2), M(3), U(4), S(5). So if we guess HUMUS, then U is at position 4? But we have already U at position 2? In the feedback from previous guesses, when we guessed SOUTH (S,O,U,T,H) with U at position 3, we got U(-) meaning U is in the word but not at 3. It didn't say anything about position 4? And we have never tested position 4 for U? So it's possible.

But another word: HUMUS? Let's check if it's valid? Yes, it is a word.

But we have to make sure there are no conflicts with absent letters? It uses U again. U is not absent? We haven't included U as absent? Absent letters: R,A,I,E,O,T,L,Y,N,K,P. U is not in that list? So yes.

So HUMUS is a candidate? But we haven't tested U in position 4? But we don't know if U is duplicated? That's a possibility.

Another candidate: HUMAS? But A is absent? From Guess1: A(x), so absent.

HUMES? But E absent? Guess1: E(x).

HUMFS? Not a word.

HUMBS? Not a word.

HUMPS was already tried? HUNKS was tried? Both not this.

So, common words: 
- HUMAN? But ends with N? Not S? We need S at the end: H U M A N -> but A and N absent? And doesn't end with S.

HUMUS: H,U,M,U,S -> which ends with S.

But note: HUMUS has U at position 4? So if we guess HUMUS, what would the feedback be? Well, for position 4: if U is there and we put U, but the secret word might have U at position 4? But if we haven't had feedback indicating U elsewhere.

Also, from Guess2: SOUTH had U at position 3 and got U(-) meaning U is present but not at pos3? Could it be at pos4? That's a possibility.

Therefore, HUMUS is a valid candidate.

But are there others? Let's list:

- Possible 5-letter words starting with HUM and ending with S? HUMUS is one.

Another: HUDUS? Not a word.

HUFFS? But HUM? HUFFS is H,U,F,F,S? But we need M at position 3? Not F? HUMUS has M at position 3? Yes? So no.

But HUMUS has M at position 3? Yes.

Perhaps HUMIC? Not ending with S.

So HUMUS seems to be a word.

Another possibility: HUMMS? H,U,M,M,S -> but M repeated. Then M at position 3 is already correct? Then in HUMPS we had M at position 3 correct? And if we put M at position 4? Then we get two M's? But the feedback for HUMPS: we put M only at position 3? So if secret word has M at position 3 and 4? Then when we put P at position 4, we got P(x)? Meaning P is absent? And we have no direct feedback on M at position 4? So it's possible? HUMUS meaning? Doesn't exist.

HUMMS meaning to hum a song or something? HUMM? Not typically a word. 

The word is HUMMUS? But HUMMUS has 6 letters? H-U-M-M-U-S, that's 6 characters? Oh! Wait! SECRET WORD IS 5 LETTERS? HUMMUS is actually spelled as HUMMUS? But that's H-U-M-M-U-S? 6 letters? Or is there a 5-letter variant?

Hummus is typically spelled with two M's? Oh, let me think? Actually: ""Humus"" is a 5-letter word meaning organic matter in soil? It's spelled H-U-M-U-S? That's 5 letters? Positions: H(1), U(2), M(3), U(4), S(5). Exactly.

So HUMUS is valid.

Now, any other words? For example: HUME? Not 5 letters.

HUMNS? N absent? Invalid.

So I think HUMUS is the only common word? But we need to confirm the feedback? 

In the previous feedback, for Guess2: SOUTH had U in position 3? U(-) meaning U is present but not in position 3? But in HUMUS, U is in position 2 and position 4? So U is indeed present and not only at position 3? So when SOUTH had U in position 3, it was correct that U is in the word? The minus means it's not at that position, but it could be elsewhere? Like position 4? So no contradiction.

Also, in other guesses? We never had a test for position 4? Except in LUSHY: H at position 4? And we got H(-) meaning H is in the word but not at position 4? And position 4 in HUMUS is U, not H? So H is at position 1? So correct.

Therefore, the secret word must be HUMUS? Or could be? But we have to guess it.

We have one last guess? Guess 6? We have used 5 guesses? Total 6 allowed.

So we should guess HUMUS.

But let's see: in HUMPS, we guessed P? Which is absent? And we know that? So the fourth letter isn't P? In HUMUS, the fourth letter is U? And U is not absent? So valid.

Therefore, we can guess HUMUS.

But note: in HUMUS, we are placing U at position 4? Which means if the secret word is indeed HUMUS, then:

- Position 1: H✓ (matches)
- Position 2: U✓ (matches)
- Position 3: M✓ (matches)
- Position 4: U? We haven't placed U here before? But U is known to be in the word? So placing U at position 4? Should we get a symbol? But if U is exactly at position 4? Then it should be ✓? Or if U is duplicated? Then the first U at position 2 is ✓, and the U at position 4 is another ✓? So then we get all ✓.

But if it's not HUMUS, we might get feedback.

But given the constraints, HUMUS is a strong candidate.

So the guess is HUMUS.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Review of Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: Confirmed `S` is in the word (not position 4) and excluded `R`, `A`, `I`, `E`.
   - **Guess 2 (SOUTH)**: Confirmed `S` not in position 1, `U` not in position 3, `H` not in position 5, and excluded `O`, `T`.
   - **Guess 3 (LUSHY)**: Fixed `U` at position 2 (✓), confirmed `S` not in position 3, `H` not in position 4, and excluded `L`, `Y`.
   - **Guess 4 (HUNKS)**: Fixed `H` at position 1 (✓), reconfirmed `U` at position 2 (✓), fixed `S` at position 5 (✓), and excluded `N`, `K`.
   - **Guess 5 (HUMPS)**: Fixed `H` at position 1 (✓), `U` at position 2 (✓), `M` at position 3 (✓), `S` at position 5 (✓), and excluded `P`.

2. **Current Word Structure**:
   - Positions 1, 2, 3, and 5 are fixed: **`H U M _ S`**.
   - Only position 4 remains unknown.

3. **Absent Letters** (compiled from all feedback):
   - `R`, `A`, `I`, `E`, `O`, `T`, `L`, `Y`, `N`, `K`, `P` (all marked ""x"" in past guesses).

4. **Available Letters for Position 4**:
   - Letters not yet tested and not excluded: `B`, `C`, `D`, `F`, `G`, `J`, `Q`, `V`, `W`, `X`, `Z`.
   - Common English words ending in `UMS` or similar patterns are limited; the only valid word fitting `H U M _ S` is **HUMUS** (a 5-letter word meaning organic soil component).

5. **Why HUMUS?**:
   - Uses `H`, `U`, `M`, `S` in known correct positions.
   - Tests `U` for position 4 (not explored before, as previous `U` feedback focused on positions 2 and 3).
   - If incorrect, feedback will exclude `U` or indicate duplication, but given constraints, **HUMUS** is the strongest candidate.

Given the above deduction, the final guess is **HUMUS**.

<guess>HUMUS</guess>",HUMUS,"We are given the following feedback from previous guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE -> R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)
  - S is in the word but not in position 4.

Guess 2: SOUTH -> S(-) O(x) U(-) T(x) H(-)
  - S is in the word but not in position 1.
  - U is in the word but not in position 3.
  - H is in the word but not in position 5.
  - O and T are not in the word.

Guess 3: LUSHY -> L(x) U(✓) S(-) H(-) Y(x)
  - U is correct in position 2.
  - S is in the word but not in position 3.
  - H is in the word but not in position 4.
  - L and Y are not in the word.

Guess 4: HUNKS -> H(✓) U(✓) N(x) K(x) S(✓)
  - H is correct in position 1.
  - U is correct in position 2.
  - S is in position 5? Wait, feedback says S(✓) which means it's correct in the position it was guessed, which was position 5? In HUNKS: positions are H(1), U(2), N(3), K(4), S(5). So S is correct at position 5.
  - N and K are not in the word.

Guess 5: HUMPS -> H(✓) U(✓) M(✓) P(x) S(✓)
  - H correct at position 1.
  - U correct at position 2.
  - M is correct at position 3? HUMPS: positions H(1), U(2), M(3), P(4), S(5). So M is correct at position 3? Feedback says M(✓) so yes.
  - S correct at position 5.
  - P at position 4 is not in the word? Feedback P(x) means P is not in the word at all.

So now, we know:
- The word is H U M ? S  (since positions 1,2,3,5 are fixed: H at 1, U at 2, M at 3, S at 5)
- Only position 4 is missing.
- We have P is not in the word? No: P(x) means P is not in the word at all. So the missing letter at position 4 is not P.

From the feedback, we also know the absent letters:
- From Guess1: R, A, I, E
- From Guess2: O, T
- From Guess3: L, Y
- From Guess4: N, K
- From Guess5: P is absent? Feedback: P(x) -> P not in the word.

So absent letters: R, A, I, E, O, T, L, Y, N, K, P.

Now, we need to find a letter for position 4 that is not in the absent list and is a valid English letter.

The word is H U M ? S.

We know the letter must be from the English alphabet excluding the absent letters.

Available letters: B, C, D, F, G, J, M? Wait M is already used at position 3, but could there be duplicate? In this case, the feedback has not indicated duplicates, but we should note that M is already in the word at position 3. So position 4 might be a different letter.

What about M? Could the secret word have M at position 3 and also another M? But the feedback for HUMPS: M in position 3 is correct (✓), but we don't see feedback for M elsewhere. However, we are only guessing one M. If there were another M, we wouldn't know. But let's not assume duplicate yet.

But the missing letter in position 4 is not P, and not any of the absent ones.

So available letters: B, C, D, F, G, J, Q, V, W, X, Z. And note that M, H, U, S are already used but we don't know about duplicates.

But we can try to find a common word that fits H U M _ S.

Possible letters: think of common English words.

Examples: 
- HUMUS? But U is at position 2 and 4? HUMUS: H,U,M,U,S -> so position 4 is U? But we have U already? And absent letters? We don't have U as absent, but U is in the word. Could there be two U's? Also, HUMUS has U at position 4? But in SOUTH, we had U at position 3 and it was minus, meaning present but wrong position? If U is also in position 4, that wasn't tested? But HUMUS is a valid word.

However, in the feedback for HUMPS, we did not get any indication about U, but since U was at position 2 and correct, if there were U at position 4, then in HUMPS we didn't put U at position 4? So no feedback for that. Similarly, M is at position 3 and correct, so position 4 is the only missing.

But let's see: in HUMPS we put P at position 4 and got P(x), meaning P is absent entirely. So the secret word has no P.

Now, HUMUS: H,U,M,U,S -> positions: H(1), U(2), M(3), U(4), S(5). So if we guess HUMUS, then U is at position 4? But we have already U at position 2? In the feedback from previous guesses, when we guessed SOUTH (S,O,U,T,H) with U at position 3, we got U(-) meaning U is in the word but not at 3. It didn't say anything about position 4? And we have never tested position 4 for U? So it's possible.

But another word: HUMUS? Let's check if it's valid? Yes, it is a word.

But we have to make sure there are no conflicts with absent letters? It uses U again. U is not absent? We haven't included U as absent? Absent letters: R,A,I,E,O,T,L,Y,N,K,P. U is not in that list? So yes.

So HUMUS is a candidate? But we haven't tested U in position 4? But we don't know if U is duplicated? That's a possibility.

Another candidate: HUMAS? But A is absent? From Guess1: A(x), so absent.

HUMES? But E absent? Guess1: E(x).

HUMFS? Not a word.

HUMBS? Not a word.

HUMPS was already tried? HUNKS was tried? Both not this.

So, common words: 
- HUMAN? But ends with N? Not S? We need S at the end: H U M A N -> but A and N absent? And doesn't end with S.

HUMUS: H,U,M,U,S -> which ends with S.

But note: HUMUS has U at position 4? So if we guess HUMUS, what would the feedback be? Well, for position 4: if U is there and we put U, but the secret word might have U at position 4? But if we haven't had feedback indicating U elsewhere.

Also, from Guess2: SOUTH had U at position 3 and got U(-) meaning U is present but not at pos3? Could it be at pos4? That's a possibility.

Therefore, HUMUS is a valid candidate.

But are there others? Let's list:

- Possible 5-letter words starting with HUM and ending with S? HUMUS is one.

Another: HUDUS? Not a word.

HUFFS? But HUM? HUFFS is H,U,F,F,S? But we need M at position 3? Not F? HUMUS has M at position 3? Yes? So no.

But HUMUS has M at position 3? Yes.

Perhaps HUMIC? Not ending with S.

So HUMUS seems to be a word.

Another possibility: HUMMS? H,U,M,M,S -> but M repeated. Then M at position 3 is already correct? Then in HUMPS we had M at position 3 correct? And if we put M at position 4? Then we get two M's? But the feedback for HUMPS: we put M only at position 3? So if secret word has M at position 3 and 4? Then when we put P at position 4, we got P(x)? Meaning P is absent? And we have no direct feedback on M at position 4? So it's possible? HUMUS meaning? Doesn't exist.

HUMMS meaning to hum a song or something? HUMM? Not typically a word. 

The word is HUMMUS? But HUMMUS has 6 letters? H-U-M-M-U-S, that's 6 characters? Oh! Wait! SECRET WORD IS 5 LETTERS? HUMMUS is actually spelled as HUMMUS? But that's H-U-M-M-U-S? 6 letters? Or is there a 5-letter variant?

Hummus is typically spelled with two M's? Oh, let me think? Actually: ""Humus"" is a 5-letter word meaning organic matter in soil? It's spelled H-U-M-U-S? That's 5 letters? Positions: H(1), U(2), M(3), U(4), S(5). Exactly.

So HUMUS is valid.

Now, any other words? For example: HUME? Not 5 letters.

HUMNS? N absent? Invalid.

So I think HUMUS is the only common word? But we need to confirm the feedback? 

In the previous feedback, for Guess2: SOUTH had U in position 3? U(-) meaning U is present but not in position 3? But in HUMUS, U is in position 2 and position 4? So U is indeed present and not only at position 3? So when SOUTH had U in position 3, it was correct that U is in the word? The minus means it's not at that position, but it could be elsewhere? Like position 4? So no contradiction.

Also, in other guesses? We never had a test for position 4? Except in LUSHY: H at position 4? And we got H(-) meaning H is in the word but not at position 4? And position 4 in HUMUS is U, not H? So H is at position 1? So correct.

Therefore, the secret word must be HUMUS? Or could be? But we have to guess it.

We have one last guess? Guess 6? We have used 5 guesses? Total 6 allowed.

So we should guess HUMUS.

But let's see: in HUMPS, we guessed P? Which is absent? And we know that? So the fourth letter isn't P? In HUMUS, the fourth letter is U? And U is not absent? So valid.

Therefore, we can guess HUMUS.

But note: in HUMUS, we are placing U at position 4? Which means if the secret word is indeed HUMUS, then:

- Position 1: H✓ (matches)
- Position 2: U✓ (matches)
- Position 3: M✓ (matches)
- Position 4: U? We haven't placed U here before? But U is known to be in the word? So placing U at position 4? Should we get a symbol? But if U is exactly at position 4? Then it should be ✓? Or if U is duplicated? Then the first U at position 2 is ✓, and the U at position 4 is another ✓? So then we get all ✓.

But if it's not HUMUS, we might get feedback.

But given the constraints, HUMUS is a strong candidate.

So the guess is HUMUS.### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Review of Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: Confirmed `S` is in the word (not position 4) and excluded `R`, `A`, `I`, `E`.
   - **Guess 2 (SOUTH)**: Confirmed `S` not in position 1, `U` not in position 3, `H` not in position 5, and excluded `O`, `T`.
   - **Guess 3 (LUSHY)**: Fixed `U` at position 2 (✓), confirmed `S` not in position 3, `H` not in position 4, and excluded `L`, `Y`.
   - **Guess 4 (HUNKS)**: Fixed `H` at position 1 (✓), reconfirmed `U` at position 2 (✓), fixed `S` at position 5 (✓), and excluded `N`, `K`.
   - **Guess 5 (HUMPS)**: Fixed `H` at position 1 (✓), `U` at position 2 (✓), `M` at position 3 (✓), `S` at position 5 (✓), and excluded `P`.

2. **Current Word Structure**:
   - Positions 1, 2, 3, and 5 are fixed: **`H U M _ S`**.
   - Only position 4 remains unknown.

3. **Absent Letters** (compiled from all feedback):
   - `R`, `A`, `I`, `E`, `O`, `T`, `L`, `Y`, `N`, `K`, `P` (all marked ""x"" in past guesses).

4. **Available Letters for Position 4**:
   - Letters not yet tested and not excluded: `B`, `C`, `D`, `F`, `G`, `J`, `Q`, `V`, `W`, `X`, `Z`.
   - Common English words ending in `UMS` or similar patterns are limited; the only valid word fitting `H U M _ S` is **HUMUS** (a 5-letter word meaning organic soil component).

5. **Why HUMUS?**:
   - Uses `H`, `U`, `M`, `S` in known correct positions.
   - Tests `U` for position 4 (not explored before, as previous `U` feedback focused on positions 2 and 3).
   - If incorrect, feedback will exclude `U` or indicate duplication, but given constraints, **HUMUS** is the strongest candidate.

Given the above deduction, the final guess is **HUMUS**.",Guess 6: HUMUS -> FEEDBACK: H(✓) U(✓) M(✓) U(✓) S(✓),SUCCESS
