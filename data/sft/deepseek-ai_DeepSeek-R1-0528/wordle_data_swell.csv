We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all are distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
 This means:
 - C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.
 - E is in the word but not in the correct position (since it's marked with ""-"").

 Important: Since E is present but not in the 5th position (where it was in ""crane""), it must be in one of the first four positions.

 We know the secret word does not contain C, R, A, N. And it does contain E, but not at the end.

 We need to make a second guess that maximizes information. We should avoid using C, R, A, N.

 Since E is in the word, we can try a word that includes E and other common letters that haven't been ruled out.

 Let's think of letters that are still possible: We've ruled out C,R,A,N. So we have the rest of the alphabet.

 Common letters we can use: B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 But note: E is already confirmed, so we should definitely include E again. Since E is not in the 5th position, we can put E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 Also, we want to test other vowels and common consonants. The word should have E and avoid C,R,A,N.

 Possible choices: We can try words like ""SPIEL"", ""FIELD"", ""SHIED"", ""TOWED"", etc. However, we want a word that has as many new letters as possible.

 Let's consider ""DEUCE"" but note it has C (which is ruled out) and E is repeated? Also ""DEUCE"" has C which is not allowed.

 Other choices: We can try ""ELBOW"", but E is at the beginning and we don't know if that's correct. However, we are trying to find the position of E.

 Since E is not in the 5th position, let's try putting E in the 4th position? Or we can try a word with E in different positions to test.

 We should avoid using letters that have been ruled out: C, R, A, N.

 Another idea: Since E is the only known letter, we can try a word that has E in the first position? But note the feedback only said E is present but not in 5th. It could be in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.

 We don't have much information, so a good strategy is to use a word with E and other common letters that we haven't tried.

 Let me list some words without C,R,A,N and with E:
 - ""TIMES"": T, I, M, E, S -> E is in the 4th position.
 - ""FIELD"": F, I, E, L, D -> E in 3rd.
 - ""DOZEN"": D, O, Z, E, N -> but N is ruled out? N was ruled out (it was marked x), so we cannot use N.

 Important: We must not use N because it's not in the word.

 So avoid: C, R, A, N.

 Let me try to find a word without these and including E.

 Common words: 
 - ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> E at the end? But feedback for E was '-' meaning it should be in the word but not at the end? Actually, ""crane"" had E at the 5th position and it was wrong. So E could be at a different position. But note: we can put E at the end again? No, because the feedback said it's not in the correct position, meaning it's not at the 5th position. So if we put E at the 5th in the next guess, we know it will be marked as absent (or wrong position if it actually is in the word but at the 5th? But wait: the secret word has E but not at position 5. That means position 5 is not E. So we shouldn't put E at position 5 again because it's not there.

 Therefore, we should try E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 For the next guess, we can try E in a new position? But we don't know which position is correct.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in a different position and test other common letters.

 Another idea: We also need to find the other letters. We've only identified E so far.

 Since we have 4 letters ruled out (C,R,A,N), we have a lot of letters to choose from.

 I propose ""SPIEL"": 
   S, P, I, E, L
   E is at position 4.

 But note: E was tried at position 5 and was wrong. Now we are trying at position 4. If we get E at position 4 marked as correct or wrong position, we'll know.

 Another word: ""TIMES"" has E at position 5? Wait: ""TIMES"" ends with S? Actually ""TIMES"" is T-I-M-E-S, so E is at position 4? No: 
 positions: 
  T (1), I(2), M(3), E(4), S(5)

 Actually ""TIMES"" has E at position 4 and S at 5.

 But we can use ""TIMES"": it doesn't contain C,R,A,N.

 However, what if the word has S? We don't know. We haven't tested S.

 Alternatively, we can use ""HOUSE"", but E at the end? That is position 5. But we know E is not at position 5. So avoid words that have E at position 5.

 So ""TIMES"" has E at position 4? Actually: 
 T -> pos1, I->2, M->3, E->4, S->5 -> So E is at position 4? But wait: is the word 5 letters? Yes.

 But note: we don't know if E is at position 4 until we try.

 Another word: ""STOLE"" - S(1), T(2), O(3), L(4), E(5) -> E at 5? We cannot do that because E cannot be at 5.

 So let's try ""SLEPT"": but S,L,E,P,T -> E is at position 3? Okay.

 But we haven't tested P and T.

 Alternatively, ""OWLET"": O,W,L,E,T -> E at position 4? And avoids C,R,A,N? Yes.

 But ""OWLET"" might be less common.

 Another common word: ""PILED"": P, I, L, E, D. E is at position 4? Actually: P(1), I(2), L(3), E(4), D(5). So E is at 4.

 We should consider including as many new letters as possible.

 Let me think: we have 6 tries. We have one known letter (E) and 4 forbidden letters (C,R,A,N). We need to cover more letters.

 I think ""TOWED"" is a candidate: T, O, W, E, D -> E at position 4? Actually: T(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), D(5). Also, no C,R,A,N.

 But we have used: in first guess: C,R,A,N,E -> so for second guess, we are using T, O, W, E, D.

 That seems okay: we are testing 4 new letters (T,O,W,D) plus E in a new position (4).

 We can also consider ""BELOW"": B,E,L,O,W -> E at position 2? And without C,R,A,N? Yes.

 Since E wasn't at position 5, we might as well try it at position 2? Then we can test B,L,O,W.

 But which position for E is more likely? We don't know, but we are trying to get information.

 Let's compare:

 Option 1: ""TOWED"" -> E at position 4, letters T,O,W,D.
 Option 2: ""BELOW"" -> E at position 2, letters B,L,O,W.

 Both are valid.

 Another common word: ""BLUES"" -> but E at position 5? Avoid.

 Another: ""FLESH"": F,L,E,S,H -> E at position 3.

 We can go with ""BELOW"": 
   B, E, L, O, W

 E is in the second position.

 But note: if E is actually in position 2, we'll get a ✓. If in another position, we'll get a - or even if it's not in position 2 but present, we get -.

 Let me choose ""BELOW"" because it tests E in a new position (position 2) and includes common letters.

 Alternatively, to cover more vowels? BELOW has O, which is a vowel.

 We could try ""QUERY"" but Q is uncommon and U,E,R (R is ruled out? R was in first guess and marked x, so no). So we cannot use R.

 Wait, R is ruled out? Yes, from first feedback: R(x) -> not in the word. So avoid R.

 So ""QUERY"" has R -> invalid? We cannot use R.

 So stick to words without C,R,A,N.

 I think ""BELOW"" is acceptable.

 But note: we have to use only English words and 5 letters.

 Let me confirm: BELOW is a valid word.

 Alternatively, ""SLEEK"" has E's, but note E at positions 3 and 4? But we don't know if there are multiple E's? We haven't got any indication of multiple E's. The word could have multiple E's? But we only know one E is present. Also, we can try words with repeated letters? But to maximize information, we avoid repeats.

 So ""SLEEK"" has two E's? And S and K are new? But we don't know if L is in.

 But I think for maximum information, avoid repeated letters.

 So ""BELOW"" is without repeated letters and tests 4 new letters: B, L, O, W.

 We already know E is present, so this word has E and 4 new letters.

 Therefore, I choose ""BELOW"".

 Let me write it: B E L O W.

 But note: positions: 
  1: B
  2: E
  3: L
  4: O
  5: W

 We will see if E is in position 2? If we get E(✓) that would be great. Otherwise, we might get E(-) meaning E is in the word but not at position 2 (but then it's in position 1,3,4? but wait, we tried position 5 and it was wrong, so remaining positions 1,3,4). But note: if E is in position 1, then in BELOW, position 2 would be not E, so it would be marked as '-' only if E is actually in the word but not at position 2? Actually, no: if E is in position 1 and we have E at position 2, then for position 1 (B) we don't know and E at position 2 would be marked as '-'? No: wait the marking is per letter.

 Actually, the feedback is per slot. So for the second slot: if the second letter of the secret word is not E, but E is in the word elsewhere, then we will see E(-). And if the secret word has E at position 1, then the B in our guess at position 1 would get checked: if it's E? no, it's B. So B at position 1 would be x (if secret word doesn't have B) or - (if secret word has B but not at start) or ✓ (if the secret word starts with B). Similarly, E at position 2: if secret word has something else at position 2, then we get E in the word? we know E is in the word, but we don't know where.

 I think ""BELOW"" is a reasonable guess.

 Alternatively, we might choose a word that has E in a slot we want to test, and other common letters.

 Another word: ""ETUDE"" -> but E is repeated? Avoid repetition. Also T and D are new? But we avoid repeated E.

 We'll go with ""BELOW"".

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- C, R, A, N are **absent** from the secret word (marked x).  
- E is **present** but **not in the 5th position** (marked -).  

This means:  
- The secret word contains E but not at the end (positions 1–4).  
- Avoid using C, R, A, N in subsequent guesses.  

For the second guess:  
- Prioritize testing E in positions 1–4 to locate its correct position.  
- Use high-frequency letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, O, L, D, B) and avoid C, R, A, N.  
- Choose a word with E in a new position (e.g., position 2) and maximize new letter coverage.  

Selected guess: **""BELOW""**  
- **B**: Tests a new common consonant at position 1.  
- **E**: Tests E at position 2, helping identify its true location.  
- **L, O**: Tests two common vowels/consonants at positions 3 and 4.  
- **W**: Tests a less common letter at position 5.  

This guess efficiently covers 4 new letters (B, L, O, W) while continuing to probe E's position.

 This means:
 - C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.
 - E is in the word but not in the correct position (since it's marked with ""-"").

 Important: Since E is present but not in the 5th position (where it was in ""crane""), it must be in one of the first four positions.

 We know the secret word does not contain C, R, A, N. And it does contain E, but not at the end.

 - ""DOZEN"": D, O, Z, E, N -> but N is ruled out? N was ruled out (it was marked x), so we cannot use N.

 Important: We must not use N because it's not in the word.

 So avoid: C, R, A, N.

 Let me try to find a word without these and including E.

 Common words: 
 - ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> E at the end? But feedback for E was '-' meaning it should be in the word but not at the end? Actually, ""crane"" had E at the 5th position and it was wrong. So E could be at a different position. But note: we can put E at the end again? No, because the feedback said it's not in the correct position, meaning it's not at the 5th position.

But wait: the secret word has E but not at position 5. That means position 5 is not E. So we shouldn't put E at position 5 again because it's not there.

 Therefore, we should try E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 For the next guess, we can try E in a new position? But we don't know which position is correct.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in a different position and test other common letters.

 Since we have 4 letters ruled out (C,R,A,N), we have a lot of letters to choose from.

 I propose ""SPIEL"": 
   S, P, I, E, L
   E is at position 4.

 But note: E was tried at position 5 and was wrong. Now we are trying at position 4. If we get E at position 4 marked as correct or wrong position, we'll know.

 Another word: ""TIMES"" has E at position 5? Wait: ""TIMES"" ends with S? Actually ""TIMES"" is T-I-M-E-S, so E is at position 4? No: 
 positions: 
  T (1), I(2), M(3), E(4), S(5)

 Actually ""TIMES"" has E at position 4 and S at 5.

 But we can use ""TIMES"": it doesn't contain C,R,A,N.

 However, what if the word has S? We don't know. We haven't tested S.

 Alternatively, we can use ""HOUSE"", but E at the end? That is position 5. But we know E is not at position 5. So avoid words that have E at position 5.

 So ""TIMES"" has E at position 4? Actually: 
 T -> pos1, I->2, M->3, E->4, S->5 -> So E is at position 4? But wait: is the word 5 letters? Yes.

 But note: we don't know if E is at position 4 until we try.

 Another word: ""STOLE"" - S(1), T(2), O(3), L(4), E(5) -> E at 5? We cannot do that because E cannot be at 5.

 So let's try ""SLEPT"": but S,L,E,P,T -> E is at position 3? Okay.

 But we haven't tested P and T.

 Alternatively, ""OWLET"": O,W,L,E,T -> E at position 4? And avoids C,R,A,N? Yes.

 But ""OWLET"" might be less common.

 Another common word: ""PILED"": P, I, L, E, D. E is at position 4? Actually: P(1), I(2), L(3), E(4), D(5). So E is at 4.

 We should consider including as many new letters as possible.

 Let me think: we have 6 tries. We have one known letter (E) and 4 forbidden letters (C,R,A,N). We need to cover more letters.

 But we have used: in first guess: C,R,A,N,E -> so for second guess, we are using T, O, W, E, D.

 We can also consider ""BELOW"": B,E,L,O,W -> E at position 2? And without C,R,A,N? Yes.

 Since E wasn't at position 5, we might as well try it at position 2? Then we can test B,L,O,W.

 But which position for E is more likely? We don't know, but we are trying to get information.

 Let's compare:

 Option 1: ""TOWED"" -> E at position 4, letters T,O,W,D.
 Option 2: ""BELOW"" -> E at position 2, letters B,L,O,W.

 Another: ""FLESH"": F,L,E,S,H -> E at position 3.

 We can go with ""BELOW"": 
   B, E, L, O, W

 E is in the second position.

 But note: if E is actually in position 2, we'll get a ✓. If in another position, we'll get a - or even if it's not in position 2 but present, we get -.

 Let me choose ""BELOW"" because it tests E in a new position (position 2) and includes common letters.

 Alternatively, to cover more vowels? BELOW has O, which is a vowel.

 We could try ""QUERY"" but Q is uncommon and U,E,R (R is ruled out? R was in first guess and marked x, so no). So we cannot use R.

 Wait, R is ruled out? Yes, from first feedback: R(x) -> not in the word. So avoid R.

 So ""QUERY"" has R -> invalid? We cannot use R.

 So stick to words without C,R,A,N.

 I think ""BELOW"" is acceptable.

 But note: we have to use only English words and 5 letters.

 Let me confirm: BELOW is a valid word.

 Alternatively, ""SLEEK"" has E's, but note E at positions 3 and 4? But we don't know if there are multiple E's? We haven't got any indication of multiple E's. The word could have multiple E's? But we only know one E is present. Also, we can try words with repeated letters? But to maximize information, we avoid repeats.

  4: O
  5: W

 We will see if E is in position 2? If we get E(✓) that would be great. Otherwise, we might get E(-) meaning E is in the word but not at position 2 (but then it's in position 1,3,4? but wait, we tried position 5 and it was wrong, so remaining positions 1,3,4). But note: if E is in position 1, then in BELOW, position 2 would be not E, so it would be marked as '-' only if E is actually in the word but not at position 2? Actually, no: if E is in position 1 and we have E at position 2, then for position 1 (B) we don't know and E at position 2 would be marked as '-'? No: wait the marking is per letter.

 Actually, the feedback is per slot. So for the second slot: if the second letter of the secret word is not E, but E is in the word elsewhere, then we will see E(-). And if the secret word has E at position 1, then the B in our guess at position 1 would get checked: if it's E? no, it's B. So B at position 1 would be x (if secret word doesn't have B) or - (if secret word has B but not at start) or ✓ (if the secret word starts with B). Similarly, E at position 2: if secret word has something else at position 2, then we get E in the word? we know E is in the word, but we don't know where.

 I think ""BELOW"" is a reasonable guess.

 Alternatively, we might choose a word that has E in a slot we want to test, and other common letters.

 Another word: ""ETUDE"" -> but E is repeated? Avoid repetition. Also T and D are new? But we avoid repeated E.

 We'll go with ""BELOW"".

<guess>below</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- C, R, A, N are **absent** from the secret word (marked x).  
- E is **present** but **not in the 5th position** (marked -).  

This means:  
- The secret word contains E but not at the end (positions 1–4).  
- Avoid using C, R, A, N in subsequent guesses.  

For the second guess:  
- Prioritize testing E in positions 1–4 to locate its correct position.  
- Use high-frequency letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, O, L, D, B) and avoid C, R, A, N.  
- Choose a word with E in a new position (e.g., position 2) and maximize new letter coverage.  

Selected guess: **""BELOW""**  
- **B**: Tests a new common consonant at position 1.  
- **E**: Tests E at position 2, helping identify its true location.  
- **L, O**: Tests two common vowels/consonants at positions 3 and 4.  
- **W**: Tests a less common letter at position 5.  

This guess efficiently covers 4 new letters (B, L, O, W) while continuing to probe E's position.",Guess 2: below -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(-) L(-) O(x) W(-),FAIL

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all are distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
 This means:
 - C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.
 - E is in the word but not in the correct position (since it's marked with ""-"").

 Important: Since E is present but not in the 5th position (where it was in ""crane""), it must be in one of the first four positions.

 We know the secret word does not contain C, R, A, N. And it does contain E, but not at the end.

 We need to make a second guess that maximizes information. We should avoid using C, R, A, N.

 Since E is in the word, we can try a word that includes E and other common letters that haven't been ruled out.

 Let's think of letters that are still possible: We've ruled out C,R,A,N. So we have the rest of the alphabet.

 Common letters we can use: B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 But note: E is already confirmed, so we should definitely include E again. Since E is not in the 5th position, we can put E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 Also, we want to test other vowels and common consonants. The word should have E and avoid C,R,A,N.

 Possible choices: We can try words like ""SPIEL"", ""FIELD"", ""SHIED"", ""TOWED"", etc. However, we want a word that has as many new letters as possible.

 Let's consider ""DEUCE"" but note it has C (which is ruled out) and E is repeated? Also ""DEUCE"" has C which is not allowed.

 Other choices: We can try ""ELBOW"", but E is at the beginning and we don't know if that's correct. However, we are trying to find the position of E.

 Since E is not in the 5th position, let's try putting E in the 4th position? Or we can try a word with E in different positions to test.

 We should avoid using letters that have been ruled out: C, R, A, N.

 Another idea: Since E is the only known letter, we can try a word that has E in the first position? But note the feedback only said E is present but not in 5th. It could be in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.

 We don't have much information, so a good strategy is to use a word with E and other common letters that we haven't tried.

 Let me list some words without C,R,A,N and with E:
 - ""TIMES"": T, I, M, E, S -> E is in the 4th position.
 - ""FIELD"": F, I, E, L, D -> E in 3rd.
 - ""DOZEN"": D, O, Z, E, N -> but N is ruled out? N was ruled out (it was marked x), so we cannot use N.

 Important: We must not use N because it's not in the word.

 So avoid: C, R, A, N.

 Let me try to find a word without these and including E.

 Common words: 
 - ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> E at the end? But feedback for E was '-' meaning it should be in the word but not at the end? Actually, ""crane"" had E at the 5th position and it was wrong. So E could be at a different position. But note: we can put E at the end again? No, because the feedback said it's not in the correct position, meaning it's not at the 5th position. So if we put E at the 5th in the next guess, we know it will be marked as absent (or wrong position if it actually is in the word but at the 5th? But wait: the secret word has E but not at position 5. That means position 5 is not E. So we shouldn't put E at position 5 again because it's not there.

 Therefore, we should try E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 For the next guess, we can try E in a new position? But we don't know which position is correct.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in a different position and test other common letters.

 Another idea: We also need to find the other letters. We've only identified E so far.

 Since we have 4 letters ruled out (C,R,A,N), we have a lot of letters to choose from.

 I propose ""SPIEL"": 
   S, P, I, E, L
   E is at position 4.

 But note: E was tried at position 5 and was wrong. Now we are trying at position 4. If we get E at position 4 marked as correct or wrong position, we'll know.

 Another word: ""TIMES"" has E at position 5? Wait: ""TIMES"" ends with S? Actually ""TIMES"" is T-I-M-E-S, so E is at position 4? No: 
 positions: 
  T (1), I(2), M(3), E(4), S(5)

 Actually ""TIMES"" has E at position 4 and S at 5.

 But we can use ""TIMES"": it doesn't contain C,R,A,N.

 However, what if the word has S? We don't know. We haven't tested S.

 Alternatively, we can use ""HOUSE"", but E at the end? That is position 5. But we know E is not at position 5. So avoid words that have E at position 5.

 So ""TIMES"" has E at position 4? Actually: 
 T -> pos1, I->2, M->3, E->4, S->5 -> So E is at position 4? But wait: is the word 5 letters? Yes.

 But note: we don't know if E is at position 4 until we try.

 Another word: ""STOLE"" - S(1), T(2), O(3), L(4), E(5) -> E at 5? We cannot do that because E cannot be at 5.

 So let's try ""SLEPT"": but S,L,E,P,T -> E is at position 3? Okay.

 But we haven't tested P and T.

 Alternatively, ""OWLET"": O,W,L,E,T -> E at position 4? And avoids C,R,A,N? Yes.

 But ""OWLET"" might be less common.

 Another common word: ""PILED"": P, I, L, E, D. E is at position 4? Actually: P(1), I(2), L(3), E(4), D(5). So E is at 4.

 We should consider including as many new letters as possible.

 Let me think: we have 6 tries. We have one known letter (E) and 4 forbidden letters (C,R,A,N). We need to cover more letters.

 I think ""TOWED"" is a candidate: T, O, W, E, D -> E at position 4? Actually: T(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), D(5). Also, no C,R,A,N.

 But we have used: in first guess: C,R,A,N,E -> so for second guess, we are using T, O, W, E, D.

 That seems okay: we are testing 4 new letters (T,O,W,D) plus E in a new position (4).

 We can also consider ""BELOW"": B,E,L,O,W -> E at position 2? And without C,R,A,N? Yes.

 Since E wasn't at position 5, we might as well try it at position 2? Then we can test B,L,O,W.

 But which position for E is more likely? We don't know, but we are trying to get information.

 Let's compare:

 Option 1: ""TOWED"" -> E at position 4, letters T,O,W,D.
 Option 2: ""BELOW"" -> E at position 2, letters B,L,O,W.

 Both are valid.

 Another common word: ""BLUES"" -> but E at position 5? Avoid.

 Another: ""FLESH"": F,L,E,S,H -> E at position 3.

 We can go with ""BELOW"": 
   B, E, L, O, W

 E is in the second position.

 But note: if E is actually in position 2, we'll get a ✓. If in another position, we'll get a - or even if it's not in position 2 but present, we get -.

 Let me choose ""BELOW"" because it tests E in a new position (position 2) and includes common letters.

 Alternatively, to cover more vowels? BELOW has O, which is a vowel.

 We could try ""QUERY"" but Q is uncommon and U,E,R (R is ruled out? R was in first guess and marked x, so no). So we cannot use R.

 Wait, R is ruled out? Yes, from first feedback: R(x) -> not in the word. So avoid R.

 So ""QUERY"" has R -> invalid? We cannot use R.

 So stick to words without C,R,A,N.

 I think ""BELOW"" is acceptable.

 But note: we have to use only English words and 5 letters.

 Let me confirm: BELOW is a valid word.

 Alternatively, ""SLEEK"" has E's, but note E at positions 3 and 4? But we don't know if there are multiple E's? We haven't got any indication of multiple E's. The word could have multiple E's? But we only know one E is present. Also, we can try words with repeated letters? But to maximize information, we avoid repeats.

 So ""SLEEK"" has two E's? And S and K are new? But we don't know if L is in.

 But I think for maximum information, avoid repeated letters.

 So ""BELOW"" is without repeated letters and tests 4 new letters: B, L, O, W.

 We already know E is present, so this word has E and 4 new letters.

 Therefore, I choose ""BELOW"".

 Let me write it: B E L O W.

 But note: positions: 
  1: B
  2: E
  3: L
  4: O
  5: W

 We will see if E is in position 2? If we get E(✓) that would be great. Otherwise, we might get E(-) meaning E is in the word but not at position 2 (but then it's in position 1,3,4? but wait, we tried position 5 and it was wrong, so remaining positions 1,3,4). But note: if E is in position 1, then in BELOW, position 2 would be not E, so it would be marked as '-' only if E is actually in the word but not at position 2? Actually, no: if E is in position 1 and we have E at position 2, then for position 1 (B) we don't know and E at position 2 would be marked as '-'? No: wait the marking is per letter.

 Actually, the feedback is per slot. So for the second slot: if the second letter of the secret word is not E, but E is in the word elsewhere, then we will see E(-). And if the secret word has E at position 1, then the B in our guess at position 1 would get checked: if it's E? no, it's B. So B at position 1 would be x (if secret word doesn't have B) or - (if secret word has B but not at start) or ✓ (if the secret word starts with B). Similarly, E at position 2: if secret word has something else at position 2, then we get E in the word? we know E is in the word, but we don't know where.

 I think ""BELOW"" is a reasonable guess.

 Alternatively, we might choose a word that has E in a slot we want to test, and other common letters.

 Another word: ""ETUDE"" -> but E is repeated? Avoid repetition. Also T and D are new? But we avoid repeated E.

 We'll go with ""BELOW"".

So B at position 1 would be x (if secret word doesn\'t have B) or - (if secret word has B but not at start) or ✓ (if the secret word starts with B). Similarly, E at position 2: if secret word has something else at position 2, then we get E in the word? we know E is in the word, but we don\'t know where.\n\n I think ""BELOW"" is a reasonable guess.\n\n Alternatively, we might choose a word that has E in a slot we want to test, and other common letters.\n\n Another word: ""ETUDE"" -> but E is repeated?

We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Meaning: 
- C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but not at position 5 (where it was in ""crane"").

Guess 2: below -> B(x) E(-) L(-) O(x) W(-)
Meaning:
- B is not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but not at position 2 (where we guessed it).
- L is in the word but not at position 3.
- O is not in the word at all.
- W is in the word but not at position 5.

Now, combining information:

Letters ruled out: C, R, A, N, B, O. These are definitely not in the word.

Letters confirmed present: E, L, W.

We know:
- E is present and not at position 2 or 5.
- L is present and not at position 3.
- W is present and not at position 5.

From the first guess, E is not at position 5. Now in the second guess, E was tried at position 2 and is not there. So E must be at position 1, 3, or 4.

Similarly, L was tried at position 3 and not there, so L is at position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

W was tried at position 5 and not there, so W is at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

We have 6 tries total and we've used 2, so 4 remaining.

Our goal: choose a word that:
- Includes E, L, W (since we know they are present).
- Does NOT include C,R,A,N,B,O (ruled out).
- Tries E,L,W in positions they haven't been tried yet to locate them.

Additionally, we must identify two more letters (since the word is 5 letters).

Possible letters: We've used C,R,A,N,E,B,L,O,W. So remaining: D,F,G,H,I,J,K,M,P,Q,S,T,U,V,X,Y,Z.

But common letters: S, T, D, P, M, H, I, etc.

We must form a 5-letter word with E,L,W and two other letters from the remaining, avoiding the ruled-out letters.

Given E must be at position 1,3, or 4; L must be at position 1,2,4, or5; W at position 1,2,3,4.

We want to design a word that positions these in conflict with previous placements? Not necessarily conflict, but to test new positions.

For example, we might try E at position 1 or 3 or 4. Similarly for L and W.

But we don't have many positions left to test without using multiple letters at once.

Since we have E,L,W all present, we might try a word that has these three and positions them in different places.

Possible words: For example:

- Position E at 1: EL, then... possible words? E L W must all fit.

Common words: ""SWELL"" but L is repeated? And we don't know if duplicates exist. Also, SWELL has S,W,E,L,L -> two L's? We don't know.

But to avoid complexity, we should probably avoid duplicates? Unless we are forced.

Another: ""DWELT"" - D W E L T -> E at position 3? But T is new.

But let's check positions:

We need to test E in position 1,3,4? And avoid positions 2 and 5.

Similarly, L avoid position 3? We also need to place L.

W avoid position 5? And we haven't tested positions 1,2,3,4.

Perhaps a word that positions E at 4 (to test one possibility) and L at 1, and W at 2? For example: ""L W _ E _"" but that might not form a word.

Consider the word ""WELSH"": W,E,L,S,H -> positions: 
- W at 1? 
- E at 2? 
- L at 3? 
- S at 4? 
- H at 5? 

But note: for E, we know E is not at position 2 (from below feedback). So we cannot put E at position 2 again? We can, but if we put it at position 2, we know it's not there. So it would be a waste? Unless we want to confirm? But we already know it's not at 2. So we shouldn't place E at positions we know it's not.

Therefore, avoid position 2 and 5 for E? But position 5 we know from both? Position 5 for E: from crane and W from below? But below W was at 5? But E wasn't tried at 5 here? No, we haven't tried E at 5 again? In below, E is at 2. Only positions 1,3,4 are available for E.

Similarly, avoid for L: position 3 (already tried). So L can be at 1,2,4,5.

For W: avoid position 5 (tried and not there). So W can be at 1,2,3,4.

Therefore, ""WELSH"" has E at position 2? But we know E isn't at position 2? So it will come back as E(-) again? But we know it's present. But position 2 we already tried and failed. So it wastes one position without testing a new possibility.

We should avoid putting E at position 2.

Similarly, avoid putting L at position 3? Yes.

So we cannot use ""WELSH"" because E at position 2 is invalid.

Let me try a word that has E in position 1: e.g., ""ELMWO""? Not an English word.

Position E at 3: e.g., ""__ E __""

Possible words: ""SLEW"" is 4 letters? Need 5.

So 5 letters: How about ""AGILE""? But A is ruled out? We cannot use A (from crane A(x)).

Or ""DEALS"": D,E,A,L,S? But A is ruled out.

We must avoid ruled out letters: B,C,N,R,O,A are ruled out? From crane: C,R,A,N and below: B,O.

So avoid: A,B,C,N,O,R.

Remaining: D,F,G,H,I,J,K,M,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

And we have E,L,W to include.

So word must contain E,L,W and two of the above.

Now, try E in position 1: 
Possible: E _ _ _ _
Words: EGRET? But has R? R ruled out? R from crane was R(x), so avoid R? Yes. 
ELVES: E L V E S? Duplicate E? Not ideal. 
EDGES: E D G E S? Two E's. 
EJECT? E J E C T? But C ruled out? C(x) from crane, so avoid C? EJECT has J and T? But E in position 1 and 3? 

Better: Single E? So ""EMPTY"": E M P T Y? but no L,W? Must have E,L,W.

So must include E,L,W.

E at 1: What words start with E and have L and W? 

Examples: ""ELBOW"" but O and B ruled out? B(x) and O(x) from below. 
So no. 
""ELDOW""? Not word.

Not many words: ""ELM"" then? Short.

E at 1, then at position 3? E _ L _ _

Words: ""SPLIT"" but no E? Must have E.

So E at 1, L at 3: ""E L _ _ "" with W somewhere?

""ELDER"": E L D E R? Two E's and R? Avoid R? 
""ELMEN""? Not word.

""ELPIS""? Not word.

Perhaps E at 4? e.g., ""___ E _"" 

Words: Possible ""FILE_""? ""FILES"" but F,I,L,E,S? L at 3? And E at 4? Then position 5: W? But W is already in? No, we need W somewhere.

""FLUME"" but has U? F,L,U,M,E? Position E at 5? But E cannot be at 5? So position E at 5 is invalid? We know E is not at position 5, so avoid.

So E must be at 1,3,4? Similarly W can be at 1,2,3,4? L at 1,2,4,5.

Try E in position 3: 
Pattern: _ _ E _ _

Possible: Place W in position 1? W _ E _ _ 

Words: ""WHELM"" but W,H,E,L,M? Positions: W(1), H(2), E(3), L(4), M(5). This seems okay.

""WHELM"" means something? It comes from ""Whelm"", a verb meaning to engulf or bury? But it's 5-letter: ""WHELM"".

Another: ""SWE?L"": ""SWELL"" with E at 3? S W E L L? Two L's? And W at 2? 

But ""SWELL"": S,W,E,L,L -> E at position 3? But two L's? We don't know if L is duplicated? Possible.

But to avoid complication, single L? 

So ""WHELM"": W(1),H(2),E(3),L(4),M(5). This contains:
- W at 1: not tried before (W was tried at 5 only? In ""below"", W at 5: so position 1 new)
- E at 3: E was tried at 5 and 2? But not 3? So new position? And E at 3? We know E can be at 1,3,4? So yes.
- L at 4: L was tried at 3? Now at 4? New position? Avoid positions tried? Previous L was at position 3? So position 4 is new? Then yes.

Also includes H and M? New letters.

And avoids prohibited letters? Check: C,R,A,N,B,O? No.

Let me verify: 
- C: not used? Avoids. 
- R: not? Avoids. 
- A: avoids. 
- N: avoids. 
- B: avoids. 
- O: avoids.

So ""WHELM"" is an English word? Yes.

Alternative: ""DWELL"": D W E L L? Again two L's? And E at position 3? And L at 4? But duplicate L.? 

Similarly, ""TWELL""? Not really? ""Dwale""? Not.

So ""WHELM"" seems acceptable.

Now, we also saw in ""WHELM"", W is at position 1? Previously W was only at position 5? So new position? And H at 2? New letter? And E at 3? New? L at 4? New (previously L at position 3)? And M at position 5? New? All letters tested? 

But note: in ""below"", we had W at 5 and now we have W at 1? But if W is in the word, we are testing a new position? We know W is present? So if W is at position 1? Then we get ✓? If not, then we get (-) meaning W is elsewhere? Similarly for E and L.

Moreover, we are testing two new letters H and M.

So ""WHELM"" seems good.

Another word: How about ""WHILE""? But has I and L? And E? E at position 3? W at position 1? H at 2? Then WHILE: W,H,I,L,E -> E at position 5? Oh wait? Positions: 
W(1), H(2), I(3), L(4), E(5)? E at 5? But E cannot be at 5? We know E is not at position 5? So we mustn't put E at 5? Therefore, ""WHILE"" puts E at 5? Invalid placement? Because we know E is not at 5? So in ""WHILE"", if E is at 5, we would get E(x) meaning not present? But we know E is present? So conflicting? Actually, no: if E is at 5, we know it shouldn't be there? But the word might have E at 5? No, we know from ""crane"" that E is in the word but not at position 5? So secret word does not have E at position 5. Therefore, we shouldn't put E at position 5? Because we know it will be marked as '-' at best? But no: if we put E at 5 and secret word has E elsewhere? Then we get E(-) meaning present? But position 5? Since we know position 5 isn't E, we can avoid? 

But more importantly, we don't want to waste a position for E? It's better not to test known impossible?

Specifically: from feedback, the secret word has E but not at position 5. So any guess with E at position 5? Then E at position 5 would be marked as '-' meaning present? Because it's not correct? But we already know that? So it doesn't give us new information about position? And we don't test the actual position? So we avoid.

Therefore, ""WHILE"" has E at 5? We skip.

Another possibility: ""FLUTE""? But F,L,U,T,E? And E at 5? Avoid.

So ""WHELM"" is better? Or ""SMEWL""? Not word.

So I choose ""WHELM"".

Now, we are going to guess ""WHELM"". But double-check: positions:
Letter 1: W -> previously W was at 5? Now at position 1? New position? Might be correct? Or if not, we get position information? Good.
Letter 2: H -> new letter? Position 2 not tried? Good.
Letter 3: E -> Previously E at positions 5 and 2? Not 3? So good.
Letter 4: L -> Previously L at position 3? Now at position 4? Good.
Letter 5: M -> new letter? Position 5: previously in crane: E(5) was not present? We mean E was present but not position? Crane: position 5: E, marked '-' meaning E is present but not at 5? The letter was E? Now M is at 5? So no conflict? Good.

Therefore, guessed word: WHELM.

</think>
From the previous feedback:

**Key Insights from Feedback:**  
1. **Ruled-out letters:** C, R, A, N (from Guess 1), B, O (added from Guess 2). These letters are **not** in the secret word.  
2. **Confirmed present letters:** E, L, W. They must appear in the word but **not** in the positions tested:  
   - E ≠ position 2 or 5 (from Guesses 1–2), so it must be at position 1, 3, or 4.  
   - L ≠ position 3 (from Guess 2), so it must be at position 1, 2, 4, or 5.  
   - W ≠ position 5 (from Guess 2), so it must be at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.  
3. **Untested positions:** Focus on placing E, L, and W in new positions to locate them accurately.  
4. **New letters:** Use remaining letters to test high-frequency consonants/vowels (e.g., H, M, D, S, T).  

**Strategy for This Guess:**  
- **Maximize new information:** Test E at position 3 (untested), L at position 4 (untested), and W at position 1 (untested) to cover new placements efficiently.  
- **Include H and M:** Test two new common letters to expand coverage.  
- **Avoid ruled-out letters:** Skip C, R, A, N, B, O.  

**Chosen Guess: ""WHELM""**  
- **W (position 1):** Tests W at an untested position (previously at 5).  
- **H (position 2):** Tests a new common consonant.  
- **E (position 3):** Probes E at an untested position (previously at 2 and 5).  
- **L (position 4):** Probes L at an untested position (previously at 3).  
- **M (position 5):** Tests a new common consonant.  

This guess efficiently tests all known present letters (E, L, W) in new positions while covering high-frequency new letters (H, M).

Specifically: from feedback, the secret word has E but not at position 5. So any guess with E at position 5? Then E at position 5 would be marked as '-' meaning present? Because it's not correct? But we already know that? So it doesn't give us new information about position? And we don't test the actual position? So we avoid.

Therefore, ""WHILE"" has E at 5? We skip.

Another possibility: ""FLUTE""? But F,L,U,T,E? And E at 5? Avoid.

So ""WHELM"" is better? Or ""SMEWL""? Not word.

So I choose ""WHELM"".

Now, we are going to guess ""WHELM"". But double-check: positions:
Letter 1: W -> previously W was at 5? Now at position 1? New position? Might be correct? Or if not, we get position information? Good.
Letter 2: H -> new letter? Position 2 not tried? Good.
Letter 3: E -> Previously E at positions 5 and 2? Not 3? So good.
Letter 4: L -> Previously L at position 3? Now at position 4? Good.
Letter 5: M -> new letter? Position 5: previously in crane: E(5) was not present? We mean E was present but not position? Crane: position 5: E, marked '-' meaning E is present but not at 5? The letter was E? Now M is at 5? So no conflict? Good.

Therefore, guessed word: WHELM.

<guess>whelm</guess>From the previous feedback:

**Key Insights from Feedback:**  
1. **Ruled-out letters:** C, R, A, N (from Guess 1), B, O (added from Guess 2). These letters are **not** in the secret word.  
2. **Confirmed present letters:** E, L, W. They must appear in the word but **not** in the positions tested:  
   - E ≠ position 2 or 5 (from Guesses 1–2), so it must be at position 1, 3, or 4.  
   - L ≠ position 3 (from Guess 2), so it must be at position 1, 2, 4, or 5.  
   - W ≠ position 5 (from Guess 2), so it must be at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.  
3. **Untested positions:** Focus on placing E, L, and W in new positions to locate them accurately.  
4. **New letters:** Use remaining letters to test high-frequency consonants/vowels (e.g., H, M, D, S, T).  

**Strategy for This Guess:**  
- **Maximize new information:** Test E at position 3 (untested), L at position 4 (untested), and W at position 1 (untested) to cover new placements efficiently.  
- **Include H and M:** Test two new common letters to expand coverage.  
- **Avoid ruled-out letters:** Skip C, R, A, N, B, O.  

**Chosen Guess: ""WHELM""**  
- **W (position 1):** Tests W at an untested position (previously at 5).  
- **H (position 2):** Tests a new common consonant.  
- **E (position 3):** Probes E at an untested position (previously at 2 and 5).  
- **L (position 4):** Probes L at an untested position (previously at 3).  
- **M (position 5):** Tests a new common consonant.  

This guess efficiently tests all known present letters (E, L, W) in new positions while covering high-frequency new letters (H, M).",Guess 3: whelm -> FEEDBACK: W(-) H(x) E(✓) L(✓) M(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,swell,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all are distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
 This means:
 - C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.
 - E is in the word but not in the correct position (since it's marked with ""-"").

 Important: Since E is present but not in the 5th position (where it was in ""crane""), it must be in one of the first four positions.

 We know the secret word does not contain C, R, A, N. And it does contain E, but not at the end.

 We need to make a second guess that maximizes information. We should avoid using C, R, A, N.

 Since E is in the word, we can try a word that includes E and other common letters that haven't been ruled out.

 Let's think of letters that are still possible: We've ruled out C,R,A,N. So we have the rest of the alphabet.

 Common letters we can use: B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 But note: E is already confirmed, so we should definitely include E again. Since E is not in the 5th position, we can put E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 Also, we want to test other vowels and common consonants. The word should have E and avoid C,R,A,N.

 Possible choices: We can try words like ""SPIEL"", ""FIELD"", ""SHIED"", ""TOWED"", etc. However, we want a word that has as many new letters as possible.

 Let's consider ""DEUCE"" but note it has C (which is ruled out) and E is repeated? Also ""DEUCE"" has C which is not allowed.

 Other choices: We can try ""ELBOW"", but E is at the beginning and we don't know if that's correct. However, we are trying to find the position of E.

 Since E is not in the 5th position, let's try putting E in the 4th position? Or we can try a word with E in different positions to test.

 We should avoid using letters that have been ruled out: C, R, A, N.

 Another idea: Since E is the only known letter, we can try a word that has E in the first position? But note the feedback only said E is present but not in 5th. It could be in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.

 We don't have much information, so a good strategy is to use a word with E and other common letters that we haven't tried.

 Let me list some words without C,R,A,N and with E:
 - ""TIMES"": T, I, M, E, S -> E is in the 4th position.
 - ""FIELD"": F, I, E, L, D -> E in 3rd.
 - ""DOZEN"": D, O, Z, E, N -> but N is ruled out? N was ruled out (it was marked x), so we cannot use N.

 Important: We must not use N because it's not in the word.

 So avoid: C, R, A, N.

 Let me try to find a word without these and including E.

 Common words: 
 - ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> E at the end? But feedback for E was '-' meaning it should be in the word but not at the end? Actually, ""crane"" had E at the 5th position and it was wrong. So E could be at a different position. But note: we can put E at the end again? No, because the feedback said it's not in the correct position, meaning it's not at the 5th position. So if we put E at the 5th in the next guess, we know it will be marked as absent (or wrong position if it actually is in the word but at the 5th? But wait: the secret word has E but not at position 5. That means position 5 is not E. So we shouldn't put E at position 5 again because it's not there.

 Therefore, we should try E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 For the next guess, we can try E in a new position? But we don't know which position is correct.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in a different position and test other common letters.

 Another idea: We also need to find the other letters. We've only identified E so far.

 Since we have 4 letters ruled out (C,R,A,N), we have a lot of letters to choose from.

 I propose ""SPIEL"": 
   S, P, I, E, L
   E is at position 4.

 But note: E was tried at position 5 and was wrong. Now we are trying at position 4. If we get E at position 4 marked as correct or wrong position, we'll know.

 Another word: ""TIMES"" has E at position 5? Wait: ""TIMES"" ends with S? Actually ""TIMES"" is T-I-M-E-S, so E is at position 4? No: 
 positions: 
  T (1), I(2), M(3), E(4), S(5)

 Actually ""TIMES"" has E at position 4 and S at 5.

 But we can use ""TIMES"": it doesn't contain C,R,A,N.

 However, what if the word has S? We don't know. We haven't tested S.

 Alternatively, we can use ""HOUSE"", but E at the end? That is position 5. But we know E is not at position 5. So avoid words that have E at position 5.

 So ""TIMES"" has E at position 4? Actually: 
 T -> pos1, I->2, M->3, E->4, S->5 -> So E is at position 4? But wait: is the word 5 letters? Yes.

 But note: we don't know if E is at position 4 until we try.

 Another word: ""STOLE"" - S(1), T(2), O(3), L(4), E(5) -> E at 5? We cannot do that because E cannot be at 5.

 So let's try ""SLEPT"": but S,L,E,P,T -> E is at position 3? Okay.

 But we haven't tested P and T.

 Alternatively, ""OWLET"": O,W,L,E,T -> E at position 4? And avoids C,R,A,N? Yes.

 But ""OWLET"" might be less common.

 Another common word: ""PILED"": P, I, L, E, D. E is at position 4? Actually: P(1), I(2), L(3), E(4), D(5). So E is at 4.

 We should consider including as many new letters as possible.

 Let me think: we have 6 tries. We have one known letter (E) and 4 forbidden letters (C,R,A,N). We need to cover more letters.

 I think ""TOWED"" is a candidate: T, O, W, E, D -> E at position 4? Actually: T(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), D(5). Also, no C,R,A,N.

 But we have used: in first guess: C,R,A,N,E -> so for second guess, we are using T, O, W, E, D.

 That seems okay: we are testing 4 new letters (T,O,W,D) plus E in a new position (4).

 We can also consider ""BELOW"": B,E,L,O,W -> E at position 2? And without C,R,A,N? Yes.

 Since E wasn't at position 5, we might as well try it at position 2? Then we can test B,L,O,W.

 But which position for E is more likely? We don't know, but we are trying to get information.

 Let's compare:

 Option 1: ""TOWED"" -> E at position 4, letters T,O,W,D.
 Option 2: ""BELOW"" -> E at position 2, letters B,L,O,W.

 Both are valid.

 Another common word: ""BLUES"" -> but E at position 5? Avoid.

 Another: ""FLESH"": F,L,E,S,H -> E at position 3.

 We can go with ""BELOW"": 
   B, E, L, O, W

 E is in the second position.

 But note: if E is actually in position 2, we'll get a ✓. If in another position, we'll get a - or even if it's not in position 2 but present, we get -.

 Let me choose ""BELOW"" because it tests E in a new position (position 2) and includes common letters.

 Alternatively, to cover more vowels? BELOW has O, which is a vowel.

 We could try ""QUERY"" but Q is uncommon and U,E,R (R is ruled out? R was in first guess and marked x, so no). So we cannot use R.

 Wait, R is ruled out? Yes, from first feedback: R(x) -> not in the word. So avoid R.

 So ""QUERY"" has R -> invalid? We cannot use R.

 So stick to words without C,R,A,N.

 I think ""BELOW"" is acceptable.

 But note: we have to use only English words and 5 letters.

 Let me confirm: BELOW is a valid word.

 Alternatively, ""SLEEK"" has E's, but note E at positions 3 and 4? But we don't know if there are multiple E's? We haven't got any indication of multiple E's. The word could have multiple E's? But we only know one E is present. Also, we can try words with repeated letters? But to maximize information, we avoid repeats.

 So ""SLEEK"" has two E's? And S and K are new? But we don't know if L is in.

 But I think for maximum information, avoid repeated letters.

 So ""BELOW"" is without repeated letters and tests 4 new letters: B, L, O, W.

 We already know E is present, so this word has E and 4 new letters.

 Therefore, I choose ""BELOW"".

 Let me write it: B E L O W.

 But note: positions: 
  1: B
  2: E
  3: L
  4: O
  5: W

 We will see if E is in position 2? If we get E(✓) that would be great. Otherwise, we might get E(-) meaning E is in the word but not at position 2 (but then it's in position 1,3,4? but wait, we tried position 5 and it was wrong, so remaining positions 1,3,4). But note: if E is in position 1, then in BELOW, position 2 would be not E, so it would be marked as '-' only if E is actually in the word but not at position 2? Actually, no: if E is in position 1 and we have E at position 2, then for position 1 (B) we don't know and E at position 2 would be marked as '-'? No: wait the marking is per letter.

 Actually, the feedback is per slot. So for the second slot: if the second letter of the secret word is not E, but E is in the word elsewhere, then we will see E(-). And if the secret word has E at position 1, then the B in our guess at position 1 would get checked: if it's E? no, it's B. So B at position 1 would be x (if secret word doesn't have B) or - (if secret word has B but not at start) or ✓ (if the secret word starts with B). Similarly, E at position 2: if secret word has something else at position 2, then we get E in the word? we know E is in the word, but we don't know where.

 I think ""BELOW"" is a reasonable guess.

 Alternatively, we might choose a word that has E in a slot we want to test, and other common letters.

 Another word: ""ETUDE"" -> but E is repeated? Avoid repetition. Also T and D are new? But we avoid repeated E.

 We'll go with ""BELOW"".

<guess>below</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- C, R, A, N are **absent** from the secret word (marked x).  
- E is **present** but **not in the 5th position** (marked -).  

This means:  
- The secret word contains E but not at the end (positions 1–4).  
- Avoid using C, R, A, N in subsequent guesses.  

For the second guess:  
- Prioritize testing E in positions 1–4 to locate its correct position.  
- Use high-frequency letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, O, L, D, B) and avoid C, R, A, N.  
- Choose a word with E in a new position (e.g., position 2) and maximize new letter coverage.  

Selected guess: **""BELOW""**  
- **B**: Tests a new common consonant at position 1.  
- **E**: Tests E at position 2, helping identify its true location.  
- **L, O**: Tests two common vowels/consonants at positions 3 and 4.  
- **W**: Tests a less common letter at position 5.  

This guess efficiently covers 4 new letters (B, L, O, W) while continuing to probe E's position.

<guess>below</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: below -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(-) L(-) O(x) W(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Meaning: 
- C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but not at position 5 (where it was in ""crane"").

Guess 2: below -> B(x) E(-) L(-) O(x) W(-)
Meaning:
- B is not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but not at position 2 (where we guessed it).
- L is in the word but not at position 3.
- O is not in the word at all.
- W is in the word but not at position 5.

Now, combining information:

Letters ruled out: C, R, A, N, B, O. These are definitely not in the word.

Letters confirmed present: E, L, W.

We know:
- E is present and not at position 2 or 5.
- L is present and not at position 3.
- W is present and not at position 5.

From the first guess, E is not at position 5. Now in the second guess, E was tried at position 2 and is not there. So E must be at position 1, 3, or 4.

Similarly, L was tried at position 3 and not there, so L is at position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

W was tried at position 5 and not there, so W is at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

We have 6 tries total and we've used 2, so 4 remaining.

Our goal: choose a word that:
- Includes E, L, W (since we know they are present).
- Does NOT include C,R,A,N,B,O (ruled out).
- Tries E,L,W in positions they haven't been tried yet to locate them.

Additionally, we must identify two more letters (since the word is 5 letters).

Possible letters: We've used C,R,A,N,E,B,L,O,W. So remaining: D,F,G,H,I,J,K,M,P,Q,S,T,U,V,X,Y,Z.

But common letters: S, T, D, P, M, H, I, etc.

We must form a 5-letter word with E,L,W and two other letters from the remaining, avoiding the ruled-out letters.

Given E must be at position 1,3, or 4; L must be at position 1,2,4, or5; W at position 1,2,3,4.

We want to design a word that positions these in conflict with previous placements? Not necessarily conflict, but to test new positions.

For example, we might try E at position 1 or 3 or 4. Similarly for L and W.

But we don't have many positions left to test without using multiple letters at once.

Since we have E,L,W all present, we might try a word that has these three and positions them in different places.

Possible words: For example:

- Position E at 1: EL, then... possible words? E L W must all fit.

Common words: ""SWELL"" but L is repeated? And we don't know if duplicates exist. Also, SWELL has S,W,E,L,L -> two L's? We don't know.

But to avoid complexity, we should probably avoid duplicates? Unless we are forced.

Another: ""DWELT"" - D W E L T -> E at position 3? But T is new.

But let's check positions:

We need to test E in position 1,3,4? And avoid positions 2 and 5.

Similarly, L avoid position 3? We also need to place L.

W avoid position 5? And we haven't tested positions 1,2,3,4.

Perhaps a word that positions E at 4 (to test one possibility) and L at 1, and W at 2? For example: ""L W _ E _"" but that might not form a word.

Consider the word ""WELSH"": W,E,L,S,H -> positions: 
- W at 1? 
- E at 2? 
- L at 3? 
- S at 4? 
- H at 5? 

But note: for E, we know E is not at position 2 (from below feedback). So we cannot put E at position 2 again? We can, but if we put it at position 2, we know it's not there. So it would be a waste? Unless we want to confirm? But we already know it's not at 2. So we shouldn't place E at positions we know it's not.

Therefore, avoid position 2 and 5 for E? But position 5 we know from both? Position 5 for E: from crane and W from below? But below W was at 5? But E wasn't tried at 5 here? No, we haven't tried E at 5 again? In below, E is at 2. Only positions 1,3,4 are available for E.

Similarly, avoid for L: position 3 (already tried). So L can be at 1,2,4,5.

For W: avoid position 5 (tried and not there). So W can be at 1,2,3,4.

Therefore, ""WELSH"" has E at position 2? But we know E isn't at position 2? So it will come back as E(-) again? But we know it's present. But position 2 we already tried and failed. So it wastes one position without testing a new possibility.

We should avoid putting E at position 2.

Similarly, avoid putting L at position 3? Yes.

So we cannot use ""WELSH"" because E at position 2 is invalid.

Let me try a word that has E in position 1: e.g., ""ELMWO""? Not an English word.

Position E at 3: e.g., ""__ E __""

Possible words: ""SLEW"" is 4 letters? Need 5.

So 5 letters: How about ""AGILE""? But A is ruled out? We cannot use A (from crane A(x)).

Or ""DEALS"": D,E,A,L,S? But A is ruled out.

We must avoid ruled out letters: B,C,N,R,O,A are ruled out? From crane: C,R,A,N and below: B,O.

So avoid: A,B,C,N,O,R.

Remaining: D,F,G,H,I,J,K,M,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

And we have E,L,W to include.

So word must contain E,L,W and two of the above.

Now, try E in position 1: 
Possible: E _ _ _ _
Words: EGRET? But has R? R ruled out? R from crane was R(x), so avoid R? Yes. 
ELVES: E L V E S? Duplicate E? Not ideal. 
EDGES: E D G E S? Two E's. 
EJECT? E J E C T? But C ruled out? C(x) from crane, so avoid C? EJECT has J and T? But E in position 1 and 3? 

Better: Single E? So ""EMPTY"": E M P T Y? but no L,W? Must have E,L,W.

So must include E,L,W.

E at 1: What words start with E and have L and W? 

Examples: ""ELBOW"" but O and B ruled out? B(x) and O(x) from below. 
So no. 
""ELDOW""? Not word.

Not many words: ""ELM"" then? Short.

E at 1, then at position 3? E _ L _ _

Words: ""SPLIT"" but no E? Must have E.

So E at 1, L at 3: ""E L _ _ "" with W somewhere?

""ELDER"": E L D E R? Two E's and R? Avoid R? 
""ELMEN""? Not word.

""ELPIS""? Not word.

Perhaps E at 4? e.g., ""___ E _"" 

Words: Possible ""FILE_""? ""FILES"" but F,I,L,E,S? L at 3? And E at 4? Then position 5: W? But W is already in? No, we need W somewhere.

""FLUME"" but has U? F,L,U,M,E? Position E at 5? But E cannot be at 5? So position E at 5 is invalid? We know E is not at position 5, so avoid.

So E must be at 1,3,4? Similarly W can be at 1,2,3,4? L at 1,2,4,5.

Try E in position 3: 
Pattern: _ _ E _ _

Possible: Place W in position 1? W _ E _ _ 

Words: ""WHELM"" but W,H,E,L,M? Positions: W(1), H(2), E(3), L(4), M(5). This seems okay.

""WHELM"" means something? It comes from ""Whelm"", a verb meaning to engulf or bury? But it's 5-letter: ""WHELM"".

Another: ""SWE?L"": ""SWELL"" with E at 3? S W E L L? Two L's? And W at 2? 

But ""SWELL"": S,W,E,L,L -> E at position 3? But two L's? We don't know if L is duplicated? Possible.

But to avoid complication, single L? 

So ""WHELM"": W(1),H(2),E(3),L(4),M(5). This contains:
- W at 1: not tried before (W was tried at 5 only? In ""below"", W at 5: so position 1 new)
- E at 3: E was tried at 5 and 2? But not 3? So new position? And E at 3? We know E can be at 1,3,4? So yes.
- L at 4: L was tried at 3? Now at 4? New position? Avoid positions tried? Previous L was at position 3? So position 4 is new? Then yes.

Also includes H and M? New letters.

And avoids prohibited letters? Check: C,R,A,N,B,O? No.

Let me verify: 
- C: not used? Avoids. 
- R: not? Avoids. 
- A: avoids. 
- N: avoids. 
- B: avoids. 
- O: avoids.

So ""WHELM"" is an English word? Yes.

Alternative: ""DWELL"": D W E L L? Again two L's? And E at position 3? And L at 4? But duplicate L.? 

Similarly, ""TWELL""? Not really? ""Dwale""? Not.

So ""WHELM"" seems acceptable.

Now, we also saw in ""WHELM"", W is at position 1? Previously W was only at position 5? So new position? And H at 2? New letter? And E at 3? New? L at 4? New (previously L at position 3)? And M at position 5? New? All letters tested? 

But note: in ""below"", we had W at 5 and now we have W at 1? But if W is in the word, we are testing a new position? We know W is present? So if W is at position 1? Then we get ✓? If not, then we get (-) meaning W is elsewhere? Similarly for E and L.

Moreover, we are testing two new letters H and M.

So ""WHELM"" seems good.

Another word: How about ""WHILE""? But has I and L? And E? E at position 3? W at position 1? H at 2? Then WHILE: W,H,I,L,E -> E at position 5? Oh wait? Positions: 
W(1), H(2), I(3), L(4), E(5)? E at 5? But E cannot be at 5? We know E is not at position 5? So we mustn't put E at 5? Therefore, ""WHILE"" puts E at 5? Invalid placement? Because we know E is not at 5? So in ""WHILE"", if E is at 5, we would get E(x) meaning not present? But we know E is present? So conflicting? Actually, no: if E is at 5, we know it shouldn't be there? But the word might have E at 5? No, we know from ""crane"" that E is in the word but not at position 5? So secret word does not have E at position 5. Therefore, we shouldn't put E at position 5? Because we know it will be marked as '-' at best? But no: if we put E at 5 and secret word has E elsewhere? Then we get E(-) meaning present? But position 5? Since we know position 5 isn't E, we can avoid? 

But more importantly, we don't want to waste a position for E? It's better not to test known impossible?

Specifically: from feedback, the secret word has E but not at position 5. So any guess with E at position 5? Then E at position 5 would be marked as '-' meaning present? Because it's not correct? But we already know that? So it doesn't give us new information about position? And we don't test the actual position? So we avoid.

Therefore, ""WHILE"" has E at 5? We skip.

Another possibility: ""FLUTE""? But F,L,U,T,E? And E at 5? Avoid.

So ""WHELM"" is better? Or ""SMEWL""? Not word.

So I choose ""WHELM"".

Now, we are going to guess ""WHELM"". But double-check: positions:
Letter 1: W -> previously W was at 5? Now at position 1? New position? Might be correct? Or if not, we get position information? Good.
Letter 2: H -> new letter? Position 2 not tried? Good.
Letter 3: E -> Previously E at positions 5 and 2? Not 3? So good.
Letter 4: L -> Previously L at position 3? Now at position 4? Good.
Letter 5: M -> new letter? Position 5: previously in crane: E(5) was not present? We mean E was present but not position? Crane: position 5: E, marked '-' meaning E is present but not at 5? The letter was E? Now M is at 5? So no conflict? Good.

Therefore, guessed word: WHELM.

<guess>whelm</guess>From the previous feedback:

**Key Insights from Feedback:**  
1. **Ruled-out letters:** C, R, A, N (from Guess 1), B, O (added from Guess 2). These letters are **not** in the secret word.  
2. **Confirmed present letters:** E, L, W. They must appear in the word but **not** in the positions tested:  
   - E ≠ position 2 or 5 (from Guesses 1–2), so it must be at position 1, 3, or 4.  
   - L ≠ position 3 (from Guess 2), so it must be at position 1, 2, 4, or 5.  
   - W ≠ position 5 (from Guess 2), so it must be at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.  
3. **Untested positions:** Focus on placing E, L, and W in new positions to locate them accurately.  
4. **New letters:** Use remaining letters to test high-frequency consonants/vowels (e.g., H, M, D, S, T).  

**Strategy for This Guess:**  
- **Maximize new information:** Test E at position 3 (untested), L at position 4 (untested), and W at position 1 (untested) to cover new placements efficiently.  
- **Include H and M:** Test two new common letters to expand coverage.  
- **Avoid ruled-out letters:** Skip C, R, A, N, B, O.  

**Chosen Guess: ""WHELM""**  
- **W (position 1):** Tests W at an untested position (previously at 5).  
- **H (position 2):** Tests a new common consonant.  
- **E (position 3):** Probes E at an untested position (previously at 2 and 5).  
- **L (position 4):** Probes L at an untested position (previously at 3).  
- **M (position 5):** Tests a new common consonant.  

This guess efficiently tests all known present letters (E, L, W) in new positions while covering high-frequency new letters (H, M).

And it does contain E, but not at the end.\n\n We need to make a second guess that maximizes information. We should avoid using C, R, A, N.\n\n Since E is in the word, we can try a word that includes E and other common letters that haven\'t been ruled out.\n\n Let\'s think of letters that are still possible: We\'ve ruled out C,R,A,N. So we have the rest of the alphabet.\n\n Common letters we can use: B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n But note: E is already confirmed, so we should definitely include E again. Since E is not in the 5th position, we can put E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n Also, we want to test other vowels and common consonants. The word should have E and avoid C,R,A,N.\n\n Possible choices: We can try words like ""SPIEL"", ""FIELD"", ""SHIED"", ""TOWED"", etc. However, we want a word that has as many new letters as possible.\n\n Let\'s consider ""DEUCE"" but note it has C (which is ruled out) and E is repeated? Also ""DEUCE"" has C which is not allowed.\n\n Other choices: We can try ""ELBOW"", but E is at the beginning and we don\'t know if that\'s correct. However, we are trying to find the position of E.\n\n Since E is not in the 5th position, let\'s try putting E in the 4th position? Or we can try a word with E in different positions to test.\n\n We should avoid using letters that have been ruled out: C, R, A, N.\n\n Another idea: Since E is the only known letter, we can try a word that has E in the first position? But note the feedback only said E is present but not in 5th. It could be in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.\n\n We don\'t have much information, so a good strategy is to use a word with E and other common letters that we haven\'t tried.\n\n Let me list some words without C,R,A,N and with E:\n - ""TIMES"": T, I, M, E, S -> E is in the 4th position.\n - ""FIELD"": F, I, E, L, D -> E in 3rd.\n - ""DOZEN"": D, O, Z, E, N -> but N is ruled out? N was ruled out (it was marked x), so we cannot use N.\n\n Important: We must not use N because it\'s not in the word.\n\n So avoid: C, R, A, N.\n\n Let me try to find a word without these and including E.\n\n Common words: \n - ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> E at the end? But feedback for E was \'-\' meaning it should be in the word but not at the end? Actually, ""crane"" had E at the 5th position and it was wrong. So E could be at a different position. But note: we can put E at the end again? No, because the feedback said it\'s not in the correct position, meaning it\'s not at the 5th position. So if we put E at the 5th in the next guess, we know it will be marked as absent (or wrong position if it actually is in the word but at the 5th? But wait: the secret word has E but not at position 5. That means position 5 is not E. So we shouldn\'t put E at position 5 again because it\'s not there.\n\n Therefore, we should try E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n For the next guess, we can try E in a new position? But we don\'t know which position is correct.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in a different position and test other common letters.\n\n Another idea: We also need to find the other letters. We\'ve only identified E so far.\n\n Since we have 4 letters ruled out (C,R,A,N), we have a lot of letters to choose from.\n\n I propose ""SPIEL"": \n   S, P, I, E, L\n   E is at position 4.\n\n But note: E was tried at position 5 and was wrong. Now we are trying at position 4. If we get E at position 4 marked as correct or wrong position, we\'ll know.\n\n Another word: ""TIMES"" has E at position 5? Wait: ""TIMES"" ends with S? Actually ""TIMES"" is T-I-M-E-S, so E is at position 4? No: \n positions: \n  T (1), I(2), M(3), E(4), S(5)\n\n Actually ""TIMES"" has E at position 4 and S at 5.\n\n But we can use ""TIMES"": it doesn\'t contain C,R,A,N.\n\n However, what if the word has S? We don\'t know. We haven\'t tested S.\n\n Alternatively, we can use ""HOUSE"", but E at the end? That is position 5. But we know E is not at position 5. So avoid words that have E at position 5.\n\n So ""TIMES"" has E at position 4? Actually: \n T -> pos1, I->2, M->3, E->4, S->5 -> So E is at position 4? But wait: is the word 5 letters? Yes.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if E is at position 4 until we try.\n\n Another word: ""STOLE"" - S(1), T(2), O(3), L(4), E(5) -> E at 5? We cannot do that because E cannot be at 5.\n\n So let\'s try ""SLEPT"": but S,L,E,P,T -> E is at position 3? Okay.\n\n But we haven\'t tested P and T.\n\n Alternatively, ""OWLET"": O,W,L,E,T -> E at position 4? And avoids C,R,A,N? Yes.\n\n But ""OWLET"" might be less common.\n\n Another common word: ""PILED"": P, I, L, E, D. E is at position 4? Actually: P(1), I(2), L(3), E(4), D(5). So E is at 4.\n\n We should consider including as many new letters as possible.\n\n Let me think: we have 6 tries. We have one known letter (E) and 4 forbidden letters (C,R,A,N). We need to cover more letters.\n\n I think ""TOWED"" is a candidate: T, O, W, E, D -> E at position 4? Actually: T(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), D(5). Also, no C,R,A,N.\n\n But we have used: in first guess: C,R,A,N,E -> so for second guess, we are using T, O, W, E, D.\n\n That seems okay: we are testing 4 new letters (T,O,W,D) plus E in a new position (4).\n\n We can also consider ""BELOW"": B,E,L,O,W -> E at position 2? And without C,R,A,N? Yes.\n\n Since E wasn\'t at position 5, we might as well try it at position 2? Then we can test B,L,O,W.\n\n But which position for E is more likely? We don\'t know, but we are trying to get information.\n\n Let\'s compare:\n\n Option 1: ""TOWED"" -> E at position 4, letters T,O,W,D.\n Option 2: ""BELOW"" -> E at position 2, letters B,L,O,W.\n\n Both are valid.\n\n Another common word: ""BLUES"" -> but E at position 5? Avoid.\n\n Another: ""FLESH"": F,L,E,S,H -> E at position 3.\n\n We can go with ""BELOW"": \n   B, E, L, O, W\n\n E is in the second position.\n\n But note: if E is actually in position 2, we\'ll get a ✓. If in another position, we\'ll get a - or even if it\'s not in position 2 but present, we get -.\n\n Let me choose ""BELOW"" because it tests E in a new position (position 2) and includes common letters.\n\n Alternatively, to cover more vowels? BELOW has O, which is a vowel.\n\n We could try ""QUERY"" but Q is uncommon and U,E,R (R is ruled out? R was in first guess and marked x, so no). So we cannot use R.\n\n Wait, R is ruled out? Yes, from first feedback: R(x) -> not in the word. So avoid R.\n\n So ""QUERY"" has R -> invalid? We cannot use R.\n\n So stick to words without C,R,A,N.\n\n I think ""BELOW"" is acceptable.\n\n But note: we have to use only English words and 5 letters.\n\n Let me confirm: BELOW is a valid word.\n\n Alternatively, ""SLEEK"" has E\'s, but note E at positions 3 and 4? But we don\'t know if there are multiple E\'s? We haven\'t got any indication of multiple E\'s. The word could have multiple E\'s? But we only know one E is present. Also, we can try words with repeated letters? But to maximize information, we avoid repeats.\n\n So ""SLEEK"" has two E\'s? And S and K are new? But we don\'t know if L is in.\n\n But I think for maximum information, avoid repeated letters.\n\n So ""BELOW"" is without repeated letters and tests 4 new letters: B, L, O, W.\n\n We already know E is present, so this word has E and 4 new letters.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""BELOW"".\n\n Let me write it: B E L O W.\n\n But note: positions: \n  1: B\n  2: E\n  3: L\n  4: O\n  5: W\n\n We will see if E is in position 2? If we get E(✓) that would be great. Otherwise, we might get E(-) meaning E is in the word but not at position 2 (but then it\'s in position 1,3,4? but wait, we tried position 5 and it was wrong, so remaining positions 1,3,4). But note: if E is in position 1, then in BELOW, position 2 would be not E, so it would be marked as \'-\' only if E is actually in the word but not at position 2? Actually, no: if E is in position 1 and we have E at position 2, then for position 1 (B) we don\'t know and E at position 2 would be marked as \'-\'? No: wait the marking is per letter.\n\n Actually, the feedback is per slot. So for the second slot: if the second letter of the secret word is not E, but E is in the word elsewhere, then we will see E(-). And if the secret word has E at position 1, then the B in our guess at position 1 would get checked: if it\'s E? no, it\'s B. So B at position 1 would be x (if secret word doesn\'t have B) or - (if secret word has B but not at start) or ✓ (if the secret word starts with B). Similarly, E at position 2: if secret word has something else at position 2, then we get E in the word? we know E is in the word, but we don\'t know where.\n\n I think ""BELOW"" is a reasonable guess.\n\n Alternatively, we might choose a word that has E in a slot we want to test, and other common letters.\n\n Another word: ""ETUDE"" -> but E is repeated? Avoid repetition. Also T and D are new? But we avoid repeated E.\n\n We\'ll go with ""BELOW"".\n\n<guess>below</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  \n- C, R, A, N are **absent** from the secret word (marked x).  \n- E is **present** but **not in the 5th position** (marked -).  \n\nThis means:  \n- The secret word contains E but not at the end (positions 1–4).  \n- Avoid using C, R, A, N in subsequent guesses.  \n\nFor the second guess:  \n- Prioritize testing E in positions 1–4 to locate its correct position.  \n- Use high-frequency letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, O, L, D, B) and avoid C, R, A, N.  \n- Choose a word with E in a new position (e.g., position 2) and maximize new letter coverage.  \n\nSelected guess: **""BELOW""**  \n- **B**: Tests a new common consonant at position 1.  \n- **E**: Tests E at position 2, helping identify its true location.  \n- **L, O**: Tests two common vowels/consonants at positions 3 and 4.  \n- **W**: Tests a less common letter at position 5.  \n\nThis guess efficiently covers 4 new letters (B, L, O, W) while continuing to probe E\'s position.\n\n<guess>below</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: below -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(-) L(-) O(x) W(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nMeaning: \n- C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.\n- E is in the word but not at position 5 (where it was in ""crane"").\n\nGuess 2: below -> B(x) E(-) L(-) O(x) W(-)\nMeaning:\n- B is not in the word at all.\n- E is in the word but not at position 2 (where we guessed it).\n- L is in the word but not at position 3.\n- O is not in the word at all.\n- W is in the word but not at position 5.\n\nNow, combining information:\n\nLetters ruled out: C, R, A, N, B, O. These are definitely not in the word.\n\nLetters confirmed present: E, L, W.\n\nWe know:\n- E is present and not at position 2 or 5.\n- L is present and not at position 3.\n- W is present and not at position 5.\n\nFrom the first guess, E is not at position 5. Now in the second guess, E was tried at position 2 and is not there. So E must be at position 1, 3, or 4.\n\nSimilarly, L was tried at position 3 and not there, so L is at position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\nW was tried at position 5 and not there, so W is at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nWe have 6 tries total and we\'ve used 2, so 4 remaining.\n\nOur goal: choose a word that:\n- Includes E, L, W (since we know they are present).\n- Does NOT include C,R,A,N,B,O (ruled out).\n- Tries E,L,W in positions they haven\'t been tried yet to locate them.\n\nAdditionally, we must identify two more letters (since the word is 5 letters).\n\nPossible letters: We\'ve used C,R,A,N,E,B,L,O,W. So remaining: D,F,G,H,I,J,K,M,P,Q,S,T,U,V,X,Y,Z.\n\nBut common letters: S, T, D, P, M, H, I, etc.\n\nWe must form a 5-letter word with E,L,W and two other letters from the remaining, avoiding the ruled-out letters.\n\nGiven E must be at position 1,3, or 4; L must be at position 1,2,4, or5; W at position 1,2,3,4.\n\nWe want to design a word that positions these in conflict with previous placements? Not necessarily conflict, but to test new positions.\n\nFor example, we might try E at position 1 or 3 or 4. Similarly for L and W.\n\nBut we don\'t have many positions left to test without using multiple letters at once.\n\nSince we have E,L,W all present, we might try a word that has these three and positions them in different places.\n\nPossible words: For example:\n\n- Position E at 1: EL, then... possible words? E L W must all fit.\n\nCommon words: ""SWELL"" but L is repeated? And we don\'t know if duplicates exist. Also, SWELL has S,W,E,L,L -> two L\'s? We don\'t know.\n\nBut to avoid complexity, we should probably avoid duplicates? Unless we are forced.\n\nAnother: ""DWELT"" - D W E L T -> E at position 3? But T is new.\n\nBut let\'s check positions:\n\nWe need to test E in position 1,3,4? And avoid positions 2 and 5.\n\nSimilarly, L avoid position 3? We also need to place L.\n\nW avoid position 5? And we haven\'t tested positions 1,2,3,4.\n\nPerhaps a word that positions E at 4 (to test one possibility) and L at 1, and W at 2? For example: ""L W _ E _"" but that might not form a word.\n\nConsider the word ""WELSH"": W,E,L,S,H -> positions: \n- W at 1? \n- E at 2? \n- L at 3? \n- S at 4? \n- H at 5? \n\nBut note: for E, we know E is not at position 2 (from below feedback). So we cannot put E at position 2 again? We can, but if we put it at position 2, we know it\'s not there. So it would be a waste? Unless we want to confirm? But we already know it\'s not at 2. So we shouldn\'t place E at positions we know it\'s not.\n\nTherefore, avoid position 2 and 5 for E? But position 5 we know from both? Position 5 for E: from crane and W from below? But below W was at 5? But E wasn\'t tried at 5 here? No, we haven\'t tried E at 5 again? In below, E is at 2. Only positions 1,3,4 are available for E.\n\nSimilarly, avoid for L: position 3 (already tried). So L can be at 1,2,4,5.\n\nFor W: avoid position 5 (tried and not there). So W can be at 1,2,3,4.\n\nTherefore, ""WELSH"" has E at position 2? But we know E isn\'t at position 2? So it will come back as E(-) again? But we know it\'s present. But position 2 we already tried and failed. So it wastes one position without testing a new possibility.\n\nWe should avoid putting E at position 2.\n\nSimilarly, avoid putting L at position 3? Yes.\n\nSo we cannot use ""WELSH"" because E at position 2 is invalid.\n\nLet me try a word that has E in position 1: e.g., ""ELMWO""? Not an English word.\n\nPosition E at 3: e.g., ""__ E __""\n\nPossible words: ""SLEW"" is 4 letters? Need 5.\n\nSo 5 letters: How about ""AGILE""? But A is ruled out? We cannot use A (from crane A(x)).\n\nOr ""DEALS"": D,E,A,L,S? But A is ruled out.\n\nWe must avoid ruled out letters: B,C,N,R,O,A are ruled out? From crane: C,R,A,N and below: B,O.\n\nSo avoid: A,B,C,N,O,R.\n\nRemaining: D,F,G,H,I,J,K,M,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z\n\nAnd we have E,L,W to include.\n\nSo word must contain E,L,W and two of the above.\n\nNow, try E in position 1: \nPossible: E _ _ _ _\nWords: EGRET? But has R? R ruled out? R from crane was R(x), so avoid R? Yes. \nELVES: E L V E S? Duplicate E? Not ideal. \nEDGES: E D G E S? Two E\'s. \nEJECT? E J E C T? But C ruled out? C(x) from crane, so avoid C? EJECT has J and T? But E in position 1 and 3? \n\nBetter: Single E? So ""EMPTY"": E M P T Y? but no L,W? Must have E,L,W.\n\nSo must include E,L,W.\n\nE at 1: What words start with E and have L and W? \n\nExamples: ""ELBOW"" but O and B ruled out? B(x) and O(x) from below. \nSo no. \n""ELDOW""? Not word.\n\nNot many words: ""ELM"" then? Short.\n\nE at 1, then at position 3? E _ L _ _\n\nWords: ""SPLIT"" but no E? Must have E.\n\nSo E at 1, L at 3: ""E L _ _ "" with W somewhere?\n\n""ELDER"": E L D E R? Two E\'s and R? Avoid R? \n""ELMEN""? Not word.\n\n""ELPIS""? Not word.\n\nPerhaps E at 4? e.g., ""___ E _"" \n\nWords: Possible ""FILE_""? ""FILES"" but F,I,L,E,S? L at 3? And E at 4? Then position 5: W? But W is already in? No, we need W somewhere.\n\n""FLUME"" but has U? F,L,U,M,E? Position E at 5? But E cannot be at 5? So position E at 5 is invalid? We know E is not at position 5, so avoid.\n\nSo E must be at 1,3,4? Similarly W can be at 1,2,3,4? L at 1,2,4,5.\n\nTry E in position 3: \nPattern: _ _ E _ _\n\nPossible: Place W in position 1? W _ E _ _ \n\nWords: ""WHELM"" but W,H,E,L,M? Positions: W(1), H(2), E(3), L(4), M(5). This seems okay.\n\n""WHELM"" means something? It comes from ""Whelm"", a verb meaning to engulf or bury? But it\'s 5-letter: ""WHELM"".\n\nAnother: ""SWE?L"": ""SWELL"" with E at 3? S W E L L? Two L\'s? And W at 2? \n\nBut ""SWELL"": S,W,E,L,L -> E at position 3? But two L\'s? We don\'t know if L is duplicated? Possible.\n\nBut to avoid complication, single L? \n\nSo ""WHELM"": W(1),H(2),E(3),L(4),M(5). This contains:\n- W at 1: not tried before (W was tried at 5 only? In ""below"", W at 5: so position 1 new)\n- E at 3: E was tried at 5 and 2? But not 3? So new position? And E at 3? We know E can be at 1,3,4? So yes.\n- L at 4: L was tried at 3? Now at 4? New position? Avoid positions tried? Previous L was at position 3? So position 4 is new? Then yes.\n\nAlso includes H and M? New letters.\n\nAnd avoids prohibited letters? Check: C,R,A,N,B,O? No.\n\nLet me verify: \n- C: not used? Avoids. \n- R: not? Avoids. \n- A: avoids. \n- N: avoids. \n- B: avoids. \n- O: avoids.\n\nSo ""WHELM"" is an English word? Yes.\n\nAlternative: ""DWELL"": D W E L L? Again two L\'s? And E at position 3? And L at 4? But duplicate L.? \n\nSimilarly, ""TWELL""? Not really? ""Dwale""? Not.\n\nSo ""WHELM"" seems acceptable.\n\nNow, we also saw in ""WHELM"", W is at position 1? Previously W was only at position 5? So new position? And H at 2? New letter? And E at 3? New? L at 4? New (previously L at position 3)? And M at position 5? New? All letters tested? \n\nBut note: in ""below"", we had W at 5 and now we have W at 1? But if W is in the word, we are testing a new position? We know W is present? So if W is at position 1? Then we get ✓? If not, then we get (-) meaning W is elsewhere? Similarly for E and L.\n\nMoreover, we are testing two new letters H and M.\n\nSo ""WHELM"" seems good.\n\nAnother word: How about ""WHILE""? But has I and L? And E? E at position 3? W at position 1? H at 2? Then WHILE: W,H,I,L,E -> E at position 5? Oh wait? Positions: \nW(1), H(2), I(3), L(4), E(5)? E at 5? But E cannot be at 5? We know E is not at position 5? So we mustn\'t put E at 5? Therefore, ""WHILE"" puts E at 5? Invalid placement? Because we know E is not at 5? So in ""WHILE"", if E is at 5, we would get E(x) meaning not present? But we know E is present? So conflicting? Actually, no: if E is at 5, we know it shouldn\'t be there? But the word might have E at 5? No, we know from ""crane"" that E is in the word but not at position 5? So secret word does not have E at position 5. Therefore, we shouldn\'t put E at position 5? Because we know it will be marked as \'-\' at best? But no: if we put E at 5 and secret word has E elsewhere? Then we get E(-) meaning present? But position 5? Since we know position 5 isn\'t E, we can avoid? \n\nBut more importantly, we don\'t want to waste a position for E? It\'s better not to test known impossible?\n\nSpecifically: from feedback, the secret word has E but not at position 5. So any guess with E at position 5? Then E at position 5 would be marked as \'-\' meaning present? Because it\'s not correct? But we already know that? So it doesn\'t give us new information about position? And we don\'t test the actual position? So we avoid.\n\nTherefore, ""WHILE"" has E at 5? We skip.\n\nAnother possibility: ""FLUTE""? But F,L,U,T,E? And E at 5? Avoid.\n\nSo ""WHELM"" is better? Or ""SMEWL""? Not word.\n\nSo I choose ""WHELM"".\n\nNow, we are going to guess ""WHELM"". But double-check: positions:\nLetter 1: W -> previously W was at 5? Now at position 1? New position? Might be correct? Or if not, we get position information? Good.\nLetter 2: H -> new letter? Position 2 not tried? Good.\nLetter 3: E -> Previously E at positions 5 and 2? Not 3? So good.\nLetter 4: L -> Previously L at position 3? Now at position 4? Good.\nLetter 5: M -> new letter? Position 5: previously in crane: E(5) was not present? We mean E was present but not position? Crane: position 5: E, marked \'-\' meaning E is present but not at 5? The letter was E? Now M is at 5? So no conflict? Good.\n\nTherefore, guessed word: WHELM.\n\n<guess>whelm</guess>From the previous feedback:\n\n**Key Insights from Feedback:**  \n1. **Ruled-out letters:** C, R, A, N (from Guess 1), B, O (added from Guess 2). These letters are **not** in the secret word.  \n2. **Confirmed present letters:** E, L, W. They must appear in the word but **not** in the positions tested:  \n   - E ≠ position 2 or 5 (from Guesses 1–2), so it must be at position 1, 3, or 4.  \n   - L ≠ position 3 (from Guess 2), so it must be at position 1, 2, 4, or 5.  \n   - W ≠ position 5 (from Guess 2), so it must be at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.  \n3. **Untested positions:** Focus on placing E, L, and W in new positions to locate them accurately.  \n4. **New letters:** Use remaining letters to test high-frequency consonants/vowels (e.g., H, M, D, S, T).  \n\n**Strategy for This Guess:**  \n- **Maximize new information:** Test E at position 3 (untested), L at position 4 (untested), and W at position 1 (untested) to cover new placements efficiently.  \n- **Include H and M:** Test two new common letters to expand coverage.  \n- **Avoid ruled-out letters:** Skip C, R, A, N, B, O.  \n\n**Chosen Guess: ""WHELM""**  \n- **W (position 1):** Tests W at an untested position (previously at 5).  \n- **H (position 2):** Tests a new common consonant.  \n- **E (position 3):** Probes E at an untested position (previously at 2 and 5).  \n- **L (position 4):** Probes L at an untested position (previously at 3).  \n- **M (position 5):** Tests a new common consonant.  \n\nThis guess efficiently tests all known present letters (E, L, W) in new positions while covering high-frequency new letters (H, M).\n\n<guess>whelm</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: below -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(-) L(-) O(x) W(-)\nGuess 3: whelm -> FEEDBACK: W(-) H(x) E(✓) L(✓) M(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for three guesses:

**Guess 1: crane**  
Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)  
Meaning:  
- C, R, A, N are absent from the word.  
- E is present but not at position 5.

**Guess 2: below**  
Feedback: B(x), E(-), L(-), O(x), W(-)  
Meaning:  
- B and O are absent.  
- E is present but not at position 2.  
- L is present but not at position 3.  
- W is present but not at position 5.

**Guess 3: whelm**  
Feedback: W(-), H(x), E(✓), L(✓), M(x)  
Meaning:  
- W is present but not at position 1.  
- H and M are absent.  
- E is correct at position 3.  
- L is correct at position 4.

### Key Conclusions:  
1. **Fixed Positions:**  
   - **Position 3 is E** (from whelm).  
   - **Position 4 is L** (from whelm).  
   So the secret word has the pattern: `_ _ E L _`.

2. **Present Letters:**  
   - **E** (already placed at position 3).  
   - **L** (already placed at position 4).  
   - **W** is present (from below) but not at positions 1 or 5.  
     - Since positions 3 and 4 are now fixed (E and L), W must be in position 2 (only remaining option).

   Confirmed: **Position 2 must be W**?  
   Recall:  
   - W was tested at position 5 (below) → absent → so W not at 5.  
   - W tested at position 1 (whelm) → absent → so W not at 1.  
   - Positions available: 2 and positions 5? But position 5 is open? Word: positions 1,2,3,4,5.  
     - Position 3 and 4 are fixed.  
     - So available positions for W: 1, 2, 5?  
        - Position 1: tried and absent? In whelm: W(-) meaning W present elsewhere? Yes.  
        - Position 5: tried in below and got W(-), meaning present elsewhere? But position in below was position 5? And it was marked ""-"", meaning present but not at position 5? So W is absent from position 5?  
        Therefore, the only open position for W is position 2?  
        Yes! Because positions 1,5 are attempted and rejected? Also position 3 is E? Position 4 is L? So W must be at position 2?  

   But note: position 2 hasn't been tried for W? We know W is present? So it must be at position 2? Therefore, we have:  
   **Position 2 is W**.  
   So the secret word must be: `_ W E L _`.

3. **Absent Letters:**  
   Total ruled out: C, R, A, N, B, O, H, M.  
   From new feedback: H(x) and M(x) from whelm? So add H and M to absent.

   So absent letters: **C, R, A, N, B, O, H, M**.

4. **Remaining Position:**  
   Position 1 and 5 are missing? We need to find the first and last letters?  
   Both must be letters that have not been ruled out? And from the alphabet except the above.

### Remaining Letters to Consider:  
We have placed ""W E L"" in positions 2,3,4? Actually:  
Secret word pattern: `_ W E L _`  
Absent: C,R,A,N,B,O,H,M.  

So the remaining letters:  
D, F, G, I, J, K, P, Q, S, T, U, V, X, Y, Z?  
But common ones: S, T, D, G, P, K, F, etc.

### Next Guess Strategy:  
- We know the word starts and ends with one of the remaining letters?  
- Goal: Test possible options? But we have two positions? We have to cover both position 1 and 5?  
- Also, we need to guess actual words?  
- Since we only need to fill two letters? We have position 1 and 5?  
  And we have many possibilities? So we should choose a word that fits the pattern `? W E L ?`?  

Possible words:  
- SWELL? S W E L L -> But L at the end? But positions: S(1),W(2),E(3),L(4),L(5)? Two L's? But position 5? How?  
- But pattern: position 1=? , position 5=?  

Given we have two positions? We might guess a word that fits?  

But note: We know W is at position 2? E at 3? L at 4?  
But already in whelm? We have L at position 4?  
Now, we need to fill position 1 and 5?  

Common words:  
- DWELL: D W E L L -> D(1), L(5) -> but L at position 5? This duplicates L? But position 4 is L? So position 5 is L?  
  - We don't know? L can be duplicated?  
- SWELL: S W E L L  
- TWELL: Not word?  
- DWELL: Valid?  
- Or with different letters: ""JEWEL""? But J W E E L -> Position: J(1), W(2), E(3), E(4)? But position 4 is already L? So conflict?  
  - Pattern: position 4 must be L? So `? W E L ?`?  
  - So words must have W at 2, E at 3, L at 4?  

Examples:  
- DWELL: D(1), W(2), E(3), L(4), L(5) -> L at position 5?  
- SWELL: S(1), W(2), E(3), L(4), L(5)  
- BUT WELL: 4 letters?  
- ""EXCEL"" but E at 1? And C absent? Avoid C?  
- ""VOWEL"": V O W E L? But O absent? Avoid O?  
- ""TWEED"": T W E E D -> Position: T(1),W(2),E(3),E(4),D(5) -> But position 4 must be L? So E cannot be at 4?  
- Position 4 must be L? So the letter at position 4 is fixed as L?  

Therefore, only words ending with L? Not necessarily? The fifth letter can be anything? But pattern is `? W E L ?`?  

So:  
- DWELL -> duplicated L?  
- SWELL -> duplicated L?  
- DWELL and SWELL are plausible?  
- Others: ""KVELL"": K V E L L? Uncommon?  
- SHELL: S H E L L? But H absent? H from whelm H(x), so avoid H?  
- TELLY? Not 5 letter?  
- YWELM? Not word?  
- ""FIELD"": F I E L D? Position: F(1), I(2), E(3), L(4), D(5) -> I(2) but second letter must be W? So no? We have W at position 2? So nothing else?  

Therefore, the only possibility? Position 2 must be W? So the word must have W at second position?  

But we don't need to test W? We already know?  

Possible words:  
- AWELL? But A absent?  
- EWELD? Not word?  
- ""DWELL"", ""SWELL"", ""KVELL"", etc?  

But note: ""DWELL"" (to dwell). ""SWELL"" (common). Also ""TWELL"", no? How about ""FJELD""? Not common?  

However, there's another common word: ""DWELL"" and ""SWELL""? But both end with L? Are there words that end with something else?  

Pattern: `? W E L ?`?  

For example:  
- ""DWELT"": D W E L T -> D(1), T(5) -> but L at position 4? So word: D W E L T? Yes!  
- Also: ""SWELT""? Not word?  

""DWELT"": verb? Yes.  
Meaning: past tense of dwell?  

Yes!  
Also:  
- TWELD? Not word?  

So possible words:  
- DWELL: `D W E L L` -> last letter L?  
- DWELT: `D W E L T` -> last letter T?  
- SWELL: `S W E L L` -> last letter L?  
- SWELT? Not a word?  
- And ""KWELA""? Not?  

So among these?  
Now, we don't know the last letter? And we have to distinguish?  

In guess 3, M is absent? So if we use words? Also consider we can test letters?  

But we need to guess one?  

Available letters? Position 1: D or S or ...?  
Position 5: L or T? But L? If we have two letters?  

How to test?  

Given we have one guess? We can guess one candidate?  
We have 3 possibilities?  
- If position 5 is L? Then words: DWELL, SWELL  
- If position 5 is T? Then DWELT?  

Now, we need to cover position 1 and 5?  

But we haven't tested D, S, T, etc?  

Since we know positions 2,3,4 are fixed? And position 1 and 5 are unknown?  

We can test a word that tests position 1 and 5?  

But we must use actual words?  

For example, we can try ""DWELT"":  
If correct? Then we win?  
If not? Then feedback would tell us?  

But note: we have multiple possibilities?  
We can also try ""SWELL""?  

Let's think:  
Since we know position 2,3,4: W,E,L?  
Position 1: possibilities: D, S, T? Or K? Or V? etc?  
Position 5: possibilities: L, T, D? But etc?  

Wait, but we don't know duplicates?  

In ""DWELT"": the letter D is at position 1? T at 5?  
In ""DWELL"": D at 1? L at 5?  
In ""SWELL"": S at 1? L at 5?  

Also: ""JEWEL""? But J at 1? W at 2? E at 3? L at 4? What at 5? But ""JEWEL"" has E at 4? We have L at 4?  
Position 4 must be L?  

Another word: ""LEVEL""? But L at position 1? And position 4? But pattern: L(1) W(2) E(3) L(4) ...? But position 5?  
Position 5: L? Then ""LEVEL"": L,E,V,E,L? Not matching? Because position 2 must be W?  

So only possibilities:  
- DWELT  
- DWELL  
- SWELL  
- SWELT? Not word?  
- TWELL? Not word?  

So DWELT, DWELL, SWELL?  

Also: ""CREWL""? C absent?  
""BREWL""? B absent?  
""YWELL""? Not word?  

So we have three candidates?  

But we can try one? For example, ""DWELT"" might be a candidate?  

Now, from feedback? We don't know position 1 and 5?  

But we have 6 guesses? We've used 3? So 3 remaining?  

We can try ""DWELT""?  

If correct? Then we win?  
Else? Feedback will tell us.  

If we guess ""DWELT""? The feedback might reveal?  

But note: if the word is ""DWELL"", then when we guess ""DWELT"", what feedback?  
Pattern:  
D: if correct? Position 1? Same?  
W: ✓  
E:✓  
L:✓  
T: if position 5? Secret is ""DWELL"": position 5 is L? So T vs L? So T is absent? Because L is already placed at 4? Wait? The secret: D W E L L?  
Then our guess: D W E L T?  
So:  
Position 1: D(✓)  
Position 2: W(✓)  
Position 3: E(✓)  
Position 4: L(✓)  
Position 5: T vs L? But in secret, L is at position 5? So T is not in the word? Unless there are two T's? But we don't have T?  
In ""DWELT"", T is guessed? Secret ""DWELL"": has L at 5? So T? Not in the word? So T(x)?  
Similarly?  

If secret ""SWELL"":  
Guess ""DWELT"":  
Position 1: D vs S? S absent? D absent? Both S and D may be? We don't know D?  
Position 1: D? Secret S? So D absent? Unless S==D?  
Then D(x)  
Then W(✓)  
E(✓)  
L(✓)  
T? If secret ""SWELL"": L at position 5? T not present? So T(x)?  

Therefore? If we guess ""DWELT""?  

If the secret is ""DWELT"": we'll get D(✓),W(✓),E(✓),L(✓),T(✓)  
If secret ""DWELL"": D(✓),W(✓),E(✓),L(✓),T(x) -> because T not in word?  
If secret ""SWELL"": D(x) -> D absent? Because S is at position 1? Then W(✓),E(✓),L(✓),T(x)?  

So by trying ""DWELT"":  
- If we get D(✓) and T(✓)? Then win?  
- If we get T(x) and D(✓)? Then it must be ""DWELL""?  
- If we get D(x) and T(x)? Then it might be ""SWELL""?  
But position 1 D(x) means D not in word? Then secret could be ""SWELL""?  

But we have more guesses? So we can do?  
Given one guess? We can solve?  

Alternatively? Choose a word that tests the first letter?  

But we know the pattern? So guess ""DWELT""?  

We might also note: In all candidates:  
Position 5 is either L or T?  
If position 5 is L, then word ends with L?  

But we don't know?  

Given efficiency? We can choose ""DWELT""?  

But there might be another word? For example, ""SWELT""? Not word?  

Or ""TWELF""? Not?  

So guessed word: DWELT?  

But first? We are allowed only one guess?  

Let me confirm?  
Secret word: possibilities DWELT, DWELL, SWELL?  

Also?  

Another possibility: ""KWELL""? K W E L L?  
Uncommon? But possible?  

Or ""VLEW""? Not?  

But let's stick to common?  

Given feedback? We can test?  

Also? We have E(✓) at position 3? L(✓) at position 4?  
So positions fixed?  

Therefore? I choose ""DWELT""?  

But note: in whlem? M absent? So no problem?  

So let's guess ""DWELT""  

If wrong? Feedback will help us?  

We have only 3 guesses left? This is the fourth?  
We have used 3? Fourth guess?  

So no risk?  

Therefore? guessed word: DWELT  

Return: <guess>dwelt</guess>  

But note: if the secret is ""DWELL""? Then it will be?  
We can see?  

But let's do it.
</think>
### Step-by-Step Thought Process:

1. **Analyzing Previous Feedback:**
   - **Guess 1 (crane):** C, R, A, N are absent (x). E is present (-) but not at position 5.
   - **Guess 2 (below):** B and O are absent (x). E is present (-) but not at position 2. L is present (-) but not at position 3. W is present (-) but not at position 5.
   - **Guess 3 (whelm):** H and M are absent (x). E is correct at position 3 (✓). L is correct at position 4 (✓). W is present (-) but not at position 1.
   
2. **Key Inferences:**
   - Positions 3 and 4 are fixed: **E** (position 3) and **L** (position 4). So the secret word pattern is: `_ _ E L _`.
   - **W is present** and must be in position 2 (since it cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 based on feedback). Thus, the pattern is: `_ W E L _`.
   - Ruled-out letters: **C, R, A, N, B, O, H, M** (absent in feedback).
   - **Unknown positions:** Position 1 and 5 need to be filled with unused letters.
   - Remaining candidate letters (not ruled out): **D, F, G, I, J, K, P, Q, S, T, U, V, X, Y, Z**.

3. **Generating Possible Words:**
   - Secret word must match `? W E L ?` and be a valid English word.
   - Top candidates:
     - **DWELT**: D at position 1, T at position 5.
     - **DWELL**: D at position 1, L at position 5 (duplicate L, possible).
     - **SWELL**: S at position 1, L at position 5 (duplicate L).
   - Other options (less common) like KWELL or JEWEL are ruled out (K/J not tested but pattern fits).

4. **Strategy for This Guess:**
   - Focus on testing **position 5** with a letter that distinguishes between candidates (e.g., T in DWELT vs. L in DWELL/SWELL).
   - Guess **DWELT**:
     - If T is correct (✓), the word is DWELT.
     - If T is absent (x), it confirms position 5 ends with L (likely DWELL or SWELL), narrowing to position 1 options (D or S).
     - Guessing DWELT provides maximum information and resolves ambiguity efficiently.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - **DWELT** is the optimal guess—it tests position 1 (D) and position 5 (T) while fitting known constraints. This leverages existing feedback and maximizes progress toward the solution.

---

**Final Guess:**  
<guess>dwelt</guess>",dwelt,"We are given feedback for three guesses:

**Guess 1: crane**  
Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)  
Meaning:  
- C, R, A, N are absent from the word.  
- E is present but not at position 5.

**Guess 2: below**  
Feedback: B(x), E(-), L(-), O(x), W(-)  
Meaning:  
- B and O are absent.  
- E is present but not at position 2.  
- L is present but not at position 3.  
- W is present but not at position 5.

**Guess 3: whelm**  
Feedback: W(-), H(x), E(✓), L(✓), M(x)  
Meaning:  
- W is present but not at position 1.  
- H and M are absent.  
- E is correct at position 3.  
- L is correct at position 4.

### Key Conclusions:  
1. **Fixed Positions:**  
   - **Position 3 is E** (from whelm).  
   - **Position 4 is L** (from whelm).  
   So the secret word has the pattern: `_ _ E L _`.

2. **Present Letters:**  
   - **E** (already placed at position 3).  
   - **L** (already placed at position 4).  
   - **W** is present (from below) but not at positions 1 or 5.  
     - Since positions 3 and 4 are now fixed (E and L), W must be in position 2 (only remaining option).

   Confirmed: **Position 2 must be W**?  
   Recall:  
   - W was tested at position 5 (below) → absent → so W not at 5.  
   - W tested at position 1 (whelm) → absent → so W not at 1.  
   - Positions available: 2 and positions 5? But position 5 is open? Word: positions 1,2,3,4,5.  
     - Position 3 and 4 are fixed.  
     - So available positions for W: 1, 2, 5?  
        - Position 1: tried and absent? In whelm: W(-) meaning W present elsewhere? Yes.  
        - Position 5: tried in below and got W(-), meaning present elsewhere? But position in below was position 5? And it was marked ""-"", meaning present but not at position 5? So W is absent from position 5?  
        Therefore, the only open position for W is position 2?  
        Yes! Because positions 1,5 are attempted and rejected? Also position 3 is E? Position 4 is L? So W must be at position 2?  

   But note: position 2 hasn't been tried for W? We know W is present? So it must be at position 2? Therefore, we have:  
   **Position 2 is W**.  
   So the secret word must be: `_ W E L _`.

3. **Absent Letters:**  
   Total ruled out: C, R, A, N, B, O, H, M.  
   From new feedback: H(x) and M(x) from whelm? So add H and M to absent.

   So absent letters: **C, R, A, N, B, O, H, M**.

4. **Remaining Position:**  
   Position 1 and 5 are missing? We need to find the first and last letters?  
   Both must be letters that have not been ruled out? And from the alphabet except the above.

### Remaining Letters to Consider:  
We have placed ""W E L"" in positions 2,3,4? Actually:  
Secret word pattern: `_ W E L _`  
Absent: C,R,A,N,B,O,H,M.  

So the remaining letters:  
D, F, G, I, J, K, P, Q, S, T, U, V, X, Y, Z?  
But common ones: S, T, D, G, P, K, F, etc.

### Next Guess Strategy:  
- We know the word starts and ends with one of the remaining letters?  
- Goal: Test possible options? But we have two positions? We have to cover both position 1 and 5?  
- Also, we need to guess actual words?  
- Since we only need to fill two letters? We have position 1 and 5?  
  And we have many possibilities? So we should choose a word that fits the pattern `? W E L ?`?  

Possible words:  
- SWELL? S W E L L -> But L at the end? But positions: S(1),W(2),E(3),L(4),L(5)? Two L's? But position 5? How?  
- But pattern: position 1=? , position 5=?  

Given we have two positions? We might guess a word that fits?  

But note: We know W is at position 2? E at 3? L at 4?  
But already in whelm? We have L at position 4?  
Now, we need to fill position 1 and 5?  

Common words:  
- DWELL: D W E L L -> D(1), L(5) -> but L at position 5? This duplicates L? But position 4 is L? So position 5 is L?  
  - We don't know? L can be duplicated?  
- SWELL: S W E L L  
- TWELL: Not word?  
- DWELL: Valid?  
- Or with different letters: ""JEWEL""? But J W E E L -> Position: J(1), W(2), E(3), E(4)? But position 4 is already L? So conflict?  
  - Pattern: position 4 must be L? So `? W E L ?`?  
  - So words must have W at 2, E at 3, L at 4?  

Examples:  
- DWELL: D(1), W(2), E(3), L(4), L(5) -> L at position 5?  
- SWELL: S(1), W(2), E(3), L(4), L(5)  
- BUT WELL: 4 letters?  
- ""EXCEL"" but E at 1? And C absent? Avoid C?  
- ""VOWEL"": V O W E L? But O absent? Avoid O?  
- ""TWEED"": T W E E D -> Position: T(1),W(2),E(3),E(4),D(5) -> But position 4 must be L? So E cannot be at 4?  
- Position 4 must be L? So the letter at position 4 is fixed as L?  

Therefore, only words ending with L? Not necessarily? The fifth letter can be anything? But pattern is `? W E L ?`?  

So:  
- DWELL -> duplicated L?  
- SWELL -> duplicated L?  
- DWELL and SWELL are plausible?  
- Others: ""KVELL"": K V E L L? Uncommon?  
- SHELL: S H E L L? But H absent? H from whelm H(x), so avoid H?  
- TELLY? Not 5 letter?  
- YWELM? Not word?  
- ""FIELD"": F I E L D? Position: F(1), I(2), E(3), L(4), D(5) -> I(2) but second letter must be W? So no? We have W at position 2? So nothing else?  

Therefore, the only possibility? Position 2 must be W? So the word must have W at second position?  

But we don't need to test W? We already know?  

Possible words:  
- AWELL? But A absent?  
- EWELD? Not word?  
- ""DWELL"", ""SWELL"", ""KVELL"", etc?  

But note: ""DWELL"" (to dwell). ""SWELL"" (common). Also ""TWELL"", no? How about ""FJELD""? Not common?  

However, there's another common word: ""DWELL"" and ""SWELL""? But both end with L? Are there words that end with something else?  

Pattern: `? W E L ?`?  

For example:  
- ""DWELT"": D W E L T -> D(1), T(5) -> but L at position 4? So word: D W E L T? Yes!  
- Also: ""SWELT""? Not word?  

""DWELT"": verb? Yes.  
Meaning: past tense of dwell?  

Yes!  
Also:  
- TWELD? Not word?  

So possible words:  
- DWELL: `D W E L L` -> last letter L?  
- DWELT: `D W E L T` -> last letter T?  
- SWELL: `S W E L L` -> last letter L?  
- SWELT? Not a word?  
- And ""KWELA""? Not?  

So among these?  
Now, we don't know the last letter? And we have to distinguish?  

In guess 3, M is absent? So if we use words? Also consider we can test letters?  

But we need to guess one?  

Available letters? Position 1: D or S or ...?  
Position 5: L or T? But L? If we have two letters?  

How to test?  

Given we have one guess? We can guess one candidate?  
We have 3 possibilities?  
- If position 5 is L? Then words: DWELL, SWELL  
- If position 5 is T? Then DWELT?  

Now, we need to cover position 1 and 5?  

But we haven't tested D, S, T, etc?  

Since we know positions 2,3,4 are fixed? And position 1 and 5 are unknown?  

We can test a word that tests position 1 and 5?  

But we must use actual words?  

For example, we can try ""DWELT"":  
If correct? Then we win?  
If not? Then feedback would tell us?  

But note: we have multiple possibilities?  
We can also try ""SWELL""?  

Let's think:  
Since we know position 2,3,4: W,E,L?  
Position 1: possibilities: D, S, T? Or K? Or V? etc?  
Position 5: possibilities: L, T, D? But etc?  

Wait, but we don't know duplicates?  

In ""DWELT"": the letter D is at position 1? T at 5?  
In ""DWELL"": D at 1? L at 5?  
In ""SWELL"": S at 1? L at 5?  

Also: ""JEWEL""? But J at 1? W at 2? E at 3? L at 4? What at 5? But ""JEWEL"" has E at 4? We have L at 4?  
Position 4 must be L?  

Another word: ""LEVEL""? But L at position 1? And position 4? But pattern: L(1) W(2) E(3) L(4) ...? But position 5?  
Position 5: L? Then ""LEVEL"": L,E,V,E,L? Not matching? Because position 2 must be W?  

So only possibilities:  
- DWELT  
- DWELL  
- SWELL  
- SWELT? Not word?  
- TWELL? Not word?  

So DWELT, DWELL, SWELL?  

Also: ""CREWL""? C absent?  
""BREWL""? B absent?  
""YWELL""? Not word?  

So we have three candidates?  

But we can try one? For example, ""DWELT"" might be a candidate?  

Now, from feedback? We don't know position 1 and 5?  

But we have 6 guesses? We've used 3? So 3 remaining?  

We can try ""DWELT""?  

If correct? Then we win?  
Else? Feedback will tell us.  

If we guess ""DWELT""? The feedback might reveal?  

But note: if the word is ""DWELL"", then when we guess ""DWELT"", what feedback?  
Pattern:  
D: if correct? Position 1? Same?  
W: ✓  
E:✓  
L:✓  
T: if position 5? Secret is ""DWELL"": position 5 is L? So T vs L? So T is absent? Because L is already placed at 4? Wait? The secret: D W E L L?  
Then our guess: D W E L T?  
So:  
Position 1: D(✓)  
Position 2: W(✓)  
Position 3: E(✓)  
Position 4: L(✓)  
Position 5: T vs L? But in secret, L is at position 5? So T is not in the word? Unless there are two T's? But we don't have T?  
In ""DWELT"", T is guessed? Secret ""DWELL"": has L at 5? So T? Not in the word? So T(x)?  
Similarly?  

If secret ""SWELL"":  
Guess ""DWELT"":  
Position 1: D vs S? S absent? D absent? Both S and D may be? We don't know D?  
Position 1: D? Secret S? So D absent? Unless S==D?  
Then D(x)  
Then W(✓)  
E(✓)  
L(✓)  
T? If secret ""SWELL"": L at position 5? T not present? So T(x)?  

Therefore? If we guess ""DWELT""?  

If the secret is ""DWELT"": we'll get D(✓),W(✓),E(✓),L(✓),T(✓)  
If secret ""DWELL"": D(✓),W(✓),E(✓),L(✓),T(x) -> because T not in word?  
If secret ""SWELL"": D(x) -> D absent? Because S is at position 1? Then W(✓),E(✓),L(✓),T(x)?  

So by trying ""DWELT"":  
- If we get D(✓) and T(✓)? Then win?  
- If we get T(x) and D(✓)? Then it must be ""DWELL""?  
- If we get D(x) and T(x)? Then it might be ""SWELL""?  
But position 1 D(x) means D not in word? Then secret could be ""SWELL""?  

But we have more guesses? So we can do?  
Given one guess? We can solve?  

Alternatively? Choose a word that tests the first letter?  

But we know the pattern? So guess ""DWELT""?  

We might also note: In all candidates:  
Position 5 is either L or T?  
If position 5 is L, then word ends with L?  

But we don't know?  

Given efficiency? We can choose ""DWELT""?  

But there might be another word? For example, ""SWELT""? Not word?  

Or ""TWELF""? Not?  

So guessed word: DWELT?  

But first? We are allowed only one guess?  

Let me confirm?  
Secret word: possibilities DWELT, DWELL, SWELL?  

Also?  

Another possibility: ""KWELL""? K W E L L?  
Uncommon? But possible?  

Or ""VLEW""? Not?  

But let's stick to common?  

Given feedback? We can test?  

Also? We have E(✓) at position 3? L(✓) at position 4?  
So positions fixed?  

Therefore? I choose ""DWELT""?  

But note: in whlem? M absent? So no problem?  

So let's guess ""DWELT""  

If wrong? Feedback will help us?  

We have only 3 guesses left? This is the fourth?  
We have used 3? Fourth guess?  

So no risk?  

Therefore? guessed word: DWELT  

Return: <guess>dwelt</guess>  

But note: if the secret is ""DWELL""? Then it will be?  
We can see?  

But let's do it.### Step-by-Step Thought Process:

1. **Analyzing Previous Feedback:**
   - **Guess 1 (crane):** C, R, A, N are absent (x). E is present (-) but not at position 5.
   - **Guess 2 (below):** B and O are absent (x). E is present (-) but not at position 2. L is present (-) but not at position 3. W is present (-) but not at position 5.
   - **Guess 3 (whelm):** H and M are absent (x). E is correct at position 3 (✓). L is correct at position 4 (✓). W is present (-) but not at position 1.
   
2. **Key Inferences:**
   - Positions 3 and 4 are fixed: **E** (position 3) and **L** (position 4). So the secret word pattern is: `_ _ E L _`.
   - **W is present** and must be in position 2 (since it cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 based on feedback). Thus, the pattern is: `_ W E L _`.
   - Ruled-out letters: **C, R, A, N, B, O, H, M** (absent in feedback).
   - **Unknown positions:** Position 1 and 5 need to be filled with unused letters.
   - Remaining candidate letters (not ruled out): **D, F, G, I, J, K, P, Q, S, T, U, V, X, Y, Z**.

3. **Generating Possible Words:**
   - Secret word must match `? W E L ?` and be a valid English word.
   - Top candidates:
     - **DWELT**: D at position 1, T at position 5.
     - **DWELL**: D at position 1, L at position 5 (duplicate L, possible).
     - **SWELL**: S at position 1, L at position 5 (duplicate L).
   - Other options (less common) like KWELL or JEWEL are ruled out (K/J not tested but pattern fits).

4. **Strategy for This Guess:**
   - Focus on testing **position 5** with a letter that distinguishes between candidates (e.g., T in DWELT vs. L in DWELL/SWELL).
   - Guess **DWELT**:
     - If T is correct (✓), the word is DWELT.
     - If T is absent (x), it confirms position 5 ends with L (likely DWELL or SWELL), narrowing to position 1 options (D or S).
     - Guessing DWELT provides maximum information and resolves ambiguity efficiently.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - **DWELT** is the optimal guess—it tests position 1 (D) and position 5 (T) while fitting known constraints. This leverages existing feedback and maximizes progress toward the solution.

**Final Guess:**",Guess 4: dwelt -> FEEDBACK: D(x) W(✓) E(✓) L(✓) T(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,5,swell,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all are distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
 This means:
 - C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.
 - E is in the word but not in the correct position (since it's marked with ""-"").

 Important: Since E is present but not in the 5th position (where it was in ""crane""), it must be in one of the first four positions.

 We know the secret word does not contain C, R, A, N. And it does contain E, but not at the end.

 We need to make a second guess that maximizes information. We should avoid using C, R, A, N.

 Since E is in the word, we can try a word that includes E and other common letters that haven't been ruled out.

 Let's think of letters that are still possible: We've ruled out C,R,A,N. So we have the rest of the alphabet.

 Common letters we can use: B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 But note: E is already confirmed, so we should definitely include E again. Since E is not in the 5th position, we can put E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 Also, we want to test other vowels and common consonants. The word should have E and avoid C,R,A,N.

 Possible choices: We can try words like ""SPIEL"", ""FIELD"", ""SHIED"", ""TOWED"", etc. However, we want a word that has as many new letters as possible.

 Let's consider ""DEUCE"" but note it has C (which is ruled out) and E is repeated? Also ""DEUCE"" has C which is not allowed.

 Other choices: We can try ""ELBOW"", but E is at the beginning and we don't know if that's correct. However, we are trying to find the position of E.

 Since E is not in the 5th position, let's try putting E in the 4th position? Or we can try a word with E in different positions to test.

 We should avoid using letters that have been ruled out: C, R, A, N.

 Another idea: Since E is the only known letter, we can try a word that has E in the first position? But note the feedback only said E is present but not in 5th. It could be in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.

 We don't have much information, so a good strategy is to use a word with E and other common letters that we haven't tried.

 Let me list some words without C,R,A,N and with E:
 - ""TIMES"": T, I, M, E, S -> E is in the 4th position.
 - ""FIELD"": F, I, E, L, D -> E in 3rd.
 - ""DOZEN"": D, O, Z, E, N -> but N is ruled out? N was ruled out (it was marked x), so we cannot use N.

 Important: We must not use N because it's not in the word.

 So avoid: C, R, A, N.

 Let me try to find a word without these and including E.

 Common words: 
 - ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> E at the end? But feedback for E was '-' meaning it should be in the word but not at the end? Actually, ""crane"" had E at the 5th position and it was wrong. So E could be at a different position. But note: we can put E at the end again? No, because the feedback said it's not in the correct position, meaning it's not at the 5th position. So if we put E at the 5th in the next guess, we know it will be marked as absent (or wrong position if it actually is in the word but at the 5th? But wait: the secret word has E but not at position 5. That means position 5 is not E. So we shouldn't put E at position 5 again because it's not there.

 Therefore, we should try E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 For the next guess, we can try E in a new position? But we don't know which position is correct.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in a different position and test other common letters.

 Another idea: We also need to find the other letters. We've only identified E so far.

 Since we have 4 letters ruled out (C,R,A,N), we have a lot of letters to choose from.

 I propose ""SPIEL"": 
   S, P, I, E, L
   E is at position 4.

 But note: E was tried at position 5 and was wrong. Now we are trying at position 4. If we get E at position 4 marked as correct or wrong position, we'll know.

 Another word: ""TIMES"" has E at position 5? Wait: ""TIMES"" ends with S? Actually ""TIMES"" is T-I-M-E-S, so E is at position 4? No: 
 positions: 
  T (1), I(2), M(3), E(4), S(5)

 Actually ""TIMES"" has E at position 4 and S at 5.

 But we can use ""TIMES"": it doesn't contain C,R,A,N.

 However, what if the word has S? We don't know. We haven't tested S.

 Alternatively, we can use ""HOUSE"", but E at the end? That is position 5. But we know E is not at position 5. So avoid words that have E at position 5.

 So ""TIMES"" has E at position 4? Actually: 
 T -> pos1, I->2, M->3, E->4, S->5 -> So E is at position 4? But wait: is the word 5 letters? Yes.

 But note: we don't know if E is at position 4 until we try.

 Another word: ""STOLE"" - S(1), T(2), O(3), L(4), E(5) -> E at 5? We cannot do that because E cannot be at 5.

 So let's try ""SLEPT"": but S,L,E,P,T -> E is at position 3? Okay.

 But we haven't tested P and T.

 Alternatively, ""OWLET"": O,W,L,E,T -> E at position 4? And avoids C,R,A,N? Yes.

 But ""OWLET"" might be less common.

 Another common word: ""PILED"": P, I, L, E, D. E is at position 4? Actually: P(1), I(2), L(3), E(4), D(5). So E is at 4.

 We should consider including as many new letters as possible.

 Let me think: we have 6 tries. We have one known letter (E) and 4 forbidden letters (C,R,A,N). We need to cover more letters.

 I think ""TOWED"" is a candidate: T, O, W, E, D -> E at position 4? Actually: T(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), D(5). Also, no C,R,A,N.

 But we have used: in first guess: C,R,A,N,E -> so for second guess, we are using T, O, W, E, D.

 That seems okay: we are testing 4 new letters (T,O,W,D) plus E in a new position (4).

 We can also consider ""BELOW"": B,E,L,O,W -> E at position 2? And without C,R,A,N? Yes.

 Since E wasn't at position 5, we might as well try it at position 2? Then we can test B,L,O,W.

 But which position for E is more likely? We don't know, but we are trying to get information.

 Let's compare:

 Option 1: ""TOWED"" -> E at position 4, letters T,O,W,D.
 Option 2: ""BELOW"" -> E at position 2, letters B,L,O,W.

 Both are valid.

 Another common word: ""BLUES"" -> but E at position 5? Avoid.

 Another: ""FLESH"": F,L,E,S,H -> E at position 3.

 We can go with ""BELOW"": 
   B, E, L, O, W

 E is in the second position.

 But note: if E is actually in position 2, we'll get a ✓. If in another position, we'll get a - or even if it's not in position 2 but present, we get -.

 Let me choose ""BELOW"" because it tests E in a new position (position 2) and includes common letters.

 Alternatively, to cover more vowels? BELOW has O, which is a vowel.

 We could try ""QUERY"" but Q is uncommon and U,E,R (R is ruled out? R was in first guess and marked x, so no). So we cannot use R.

 Wait, R is ruled out? Yes, from first feedback: R(x) -> not in the word. So avoid R.

 So ""QUERY"" has R -> invalid? We cannot use R.

 So stick to words without C,R,A,N.

 I think ""BELOW"" is acceptable.

 But note: we have to use only English words and 5 letters.

 Let me confirm: BELOW is a valid word.

 Alternatively, ""SLEEK"" has E's, but note E at positions 3 and 4? But we don't know if there are multiple E's? We haven't got any indication of multiple E's. The word could have multiple E's? But we only know one E is present. Also, we can try words with repeated letters? But to maximize information, we avoid repeats.

 So ""SLEEK"" has two E's? And S and K are new? But we don't know if L is in.

 But I think for maximum information, avoid repeated letters.

 So ""BELOW"" is without repeated letters and tests 4 new letters: B, L, O, W.

 We already know E is present, so this word has E and 4 new letters.

 Therefore, I choose ""BELOW"".

 Let me write it: B E L O W.

 But note: positions: 
  1: B
  2: E
  3: L
  4: O
  5: W

 We will see if E is in position 2? If we get E(✓) that would be great. Otherwise, we might get E(-) meaning E is in the word but not at position 2 (but then it's in position 1,3,4? but wait, we tried position 5 and it was wrong, so remaining positions 1,3,4). But note: if E is in position 1, then in BELOW, position 2 would be not E, so it would be marked as '-' only if E is actually in the word but not at position 2? Actually, no: if E is in position 1 and we have E at position 2, then for position 1 (B) we don't know and E at position 2 would be marked as '-'? No: wait the marking is per letter.

 Actually, the feedback is per slot. So for the second slot: if the second letter of the secret word is not E, but E is in the word elsewhere, then we will see E(-). And if the secret word has E at position 1, then the B in our guess at position 1 would get checked: if it's E? no, it's B. So B at position 1 would be x (if secret word doesn't have B) or - (if secret word has B but not at start) or ✓ (if the secret word starts with B). Similarly, E at position 2: if secret word has something else at position 2, then we get E in the word? we know E is in the word, but we don't know where.

 I think ""BELOW"" is a reasonable guess.

 Alternatively, we might choose a word that has E in a slot we want to test, and other common letters.

 Another word: ""ETUDE"" -> but E is repeated? Avoid repetition. Also T and D are new? But we avoid repeated E.

 We'll go with ""BELOW"".

<guess>below</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- C, R, A, N are **absent** from the secret word (marked x).  
- E is **present** but **not in the 5th position** (marked -).  

This means:  
- The secret word contains E but not at the end (positions 1–4).  
- Avoid using C, R, A, N in subsequent guesses.  

For the second guess:  
- Prioritize testing E in positions 1–4 to locate its correct position.  
- Use high-frequency letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, O, L, D, B) and avoid C, R, A, N.  
- Choose a word with E in a new position (e.g., position 2) and maximize new letter coverage.  

Selected guess: **""BELOW""**  
- **B**: Tests a new common consonant at position 1.  
- **E**: Tests E at position 2, helping identify its true location.  
- **L, O**: Tests two common vowels/consonants at positions 3 and 4.  
- **W**: Tests a less common letter at position 5.  

This guess efficiently covers 4 new letters (B, L, O, W) while continuing to probe E's position.

<guess>below</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: below -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(-) L(-) O(x) W(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Meaning: 
- C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but not at position 5 (where it was in ""crane"").

- E is in the word but not at position 2 (where we guessed it).
- L is in the word but not at position 3.

- W is in the word but not at position 5.

- L is present and not at position 3.
- W is present and not at position 5.

From the first guess, E is not at position 5. Now in the second guess, E was tried at position 2 and is not there. So E must be at position 1, 3, or 4.

Similarly, L was tried at position 3 and not there, so L is at position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

W was tried at position 5 and not there, so W is at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

We have 6 tries total and we've used 2, so 4 remaining.

Our goal: choose a word that:
- Includes E, L, W (since we know they are present).
- Does NOT include C,R,A,N,B,O (ruled out).
- Tries E,L,W in positions they haven't been tried yet to locate them.

Additionally, we must identify two more letters (since the word is 5 letters).

Possible letters: We've used C,R,A,N,E,B,L,O,W. So remaining: D,F,G,H,I,J,K,M,P,Q,S,T,U,V,X,Y,Z.

But common letters: S, T, D, P, M, H, I, etc.

We must form a 5-letter word with E,L,W and two other letters from the remaining, avoiding the ruled-out letters.

Given E must be at position 1,3, or 4; L must be at position 1,2,4, or5; W at position 1,2,3,4.

We want to design a word that positions these in conflict with previous placements? Not necessarily conflict, but to test new positions.

For example, we might try E at position 1 or 3 or 4. Similarly for L and W.

But we don't have many positions left to test without using multiple letters at once.

Since we have E,L,W all present, we might try a word that has these three and positions them in different places.

Possible words: For example:

- Position E at 1: EL, then... possible words? E L W must all fit.

Common words: ""SWELL"" but L is repeated? And we don't know if duplicates exist. Also, SWELL has S,W,E,L,L -> two L's? We don't know.

But to avoid complexity, we should probably avoid duplicates? Unless we are forced.

Another: ""DWELT"" - D W E L T -> E at position 3? But T is new.

But let's check positions:

We need to test E in position 1,3,4? And avoid positions 2 and 5.

Similarly, L avoid position 3? We also need to place L.

W avoid position 5? And we haven't tested positions 1,2,3,4.

Perhaps a word that positions E at 4 (to test one possibility) and L at 1, and W at 2? For example: ""L W _ E _"" but that might not form a word.

Consider the word ""WELSH"": W,E,L,S,H -> positions: 
- W at 1? 
- E at 2? 
- L at 3? 
- S at 4? 
- H at 5? 

But note: for E, we know E is not at position 2 (from below feedback). So we cannot put E at position 2 again? We can, but if we put it at position 2, we know it's not there. So it would be a waste? Unless we want to confirm? But we already know it's not at 2. So we shouldn't place E at positions we know it's not.

Therefore, avoid position 2 and 5 for E? But position 5 we know from both? Position 5 for E: from crane and W from below? But below W was at 5? But E wasn't tried at 5 here? No, we haven't tried E at 5 again? In below, E is at 2. Only positions 1,3,4 are available for E.

Similarly, avoid for L: position 3 (already tried). So L can be at 1,2,4,5.

For W: avoid position 5 (tried and not there). So W can be at 1,2,3,4.

Therefore, ""WELSH"" has E at position 2? But we know E isn't at position 2? So it will come back as E(-) again? But we know it's present. But position 2 we already tried and failed. So it wastes one position without testing a new possibility.

We should avoid putting E at position 2.

Similarly, avoid putting L at position 3? Yes.

So we cannot use ""WELSH"" because E at position 2 is invalid.

Let me try a word that has E in position 1: e.g., ""ELMWO""? Not an English word.

Position E at 3: e.g., ""__ E __""

Possible words: ""SLEW"" is 4 letters? Need 5.

So 5 letters: How about ""AGILE""? But A is ruled out? We cannot use A (from crane A(x)).

Or ""DEALS"": D,E,A,L,S? But A is ruled out.

We must avoid ruled out letters: B,C,N,R,O,A are ruled out? From crane: C,R,A,N and below: B,O.

So avoid: A,B,C,N,O,R.

Remaining: D,F,G,H,I,J,K,M,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

And we have E,L,W to include.

So word must contain E,L,W and two of the above.

Now, try E in position 1: 
Possible: E _ _ _ _
Words: EGRET? But has R? R ruled out? R from crane was R(x), so avoid R? Yes. 
ELVES: E L V E S? Duplicate E? Not ideal. 
EDGES: E D G E S? Two E's. 
EJECT? E J E C T? But C ruled out? C(x) from crane, so avoid C? EJECT has J and T? But E in position 1 and 3? 

Better: Single E? So ""EMPTY"": E M P T Y? but no L,W? Must have E,L,W.

So must include E,L,W.

E at 1: What words start with E and have L and W? 

Examples: ""ELBOW"" but O and B ruled out? B(x) and O(x) from below. 
So no. 
""ELDOW""? Not word.

Not many words: ""ELM"" then? Short.

E at 1, then at position 3? E _ L _ _

Words: ""SPLIT"" but no E? Must have E.

So E at 1, L at 3: ""E L _ _ "" with W somewhere?

""ELDER"": E L D E R? Two E's and R? Avoid R? 
""ELMEN""? Not word.

""ELPIS""? Not word.

Perhaps E at 4? e.g., ""___ E _"" 

Words: Possible ""FILE_""? ""FILES"" but F,I,L,E,S? L at 3? And E at 4? Then position 5: W? But W is already in? No, we need W somewhere.

""FLUME"" but has U? F,L,U,M,E? Position E at 5? But E cannot be at 5? So position E at 5 is invalid? We know E is not at position 5, so avoid.

So E must be at 1,3,4? Similarly W can be at 1,2,3,4? L at 1,2,4,5.

Try E in position 3: 
Pattern: _ _ E _ _

Possible: Place W in position 1? W _ E _ _ 

Words: ""WHELM"" but W,H,E,L,M? Positions: W(1), H(2), E(3), L(4), M(5). This seems okay.

""WHELM"" means something? It comes from ""Whelm"", a verb meaning to engulf or bury? But it's 5-letter: ""WHELM"".

Another: ""SWE?L"": ""SWELL"" with E at 3? S W E L L? Two L's? And W at 2? 

But ""SWELL"": S,W,E,L,L -> E at position 3? But two L's? We don't know if L is duplicated? Possible.

But to avoid complication, single L? 

So ""WHELM"": W(1),H(2),E(3),L(4),M(5). This contains:
- W at 1: not tried before (W was tried at 5 only? In ""below"", W at 5: so position 1 new)
- E at 3: E was tried at 5 and 2? But not 3? So new position? And E at 3? We know E can be at 1,3,4? So yes.
- L at 4: L was tried at 3? Now at 4? New position? Avoid positions tried? Previous L was at position 3? So position 4 is new? Then yes.

Also includes H and M? New letters.

And avoids prohibited letters? Check: C,R,A,N,B,O? No.

Let me verify: 
- C: not used? Avoids. 
- R: not? Avoids. 
- A: avoids. 
- N: avoids. 
- B: avoids. 
- O: avoids.

So ""WHELM"" is an English word? Yes.

Alternative: ""DWELL"": D W E L L? Again two L's? And E at position 3? And L at 4? But duplicate L.? 

Similarly, ""TWELL""? Not really? ""Dwale""? Not.

So ""WHELM"" seems acceptable.

Now, we also saw in ""WHELM"", W is at position 1? Previously W was only at position 5? So new position? And H at 2? New letter? And E at 3? New? L at 4? New (previously L at position 3)? And M at position 5? New? All letters tested? 

But note: in ""below"", we had W at 5 and now we have W at 1? But if W is in the word, we are testing a new position? We know W is present? So if W is at position 1? Then we get ✓? If not, then we get (-) meaning W is elsewhere? Similarly for E and L.

Moreover, we are testing two new letters H and M.

So ""WHELM"" seems good.

Another word: How about ""WHILE""? But has I and L? And E? E at position 3? W at position 1? H at 2? Then WHILE: W,H,I,L,E -> E at position 5? Oh wait? Positions: 
W(1), H(2), I(3), L(4), E(5)? E at 5? But E cannot be at 5? We know E is not at position 5? So we mustn't put E at 5? Therefore, ""WHILE"" puts E at 5? Invalid placement? Because we know E is not at 5? So in ""WHILE"", if E is at 5, we would get E(x) meaning not present? But we know E is present? So conflicting? Actually, no: if E is at 5, we know it shouldn't be there? But the word might have E at 5? No, we know from ""crane"" that E is in the word but not at position 5? So secret word does not have E at position 5. Therefore, we shouldn't put E at position 5? Because we know it will be marked as '-' at best? But no: if we put E at 5 and secret word has E elsewhere? Then we get E(-) meaning present? But position 5? Since we know position 5 isn't E, we can avoid? 

But more importantly, we don't want to waste a position for E? It's better not to test known impossible?

Specifically: from feedback, the secret word has E but not at position 5. So any guess with E at position 5? Then E at position 5 would be marked as '-' meaning present? Because it's not correct? But we already know that? So it doesn't give us new information about position? And we don't test the actual position? So we avoid.

Therefore, ""WHILE"" has E at 5? We skip.

Another possibility: ""FLUTE""? But F,L,U,T,E? And E at 5? Avoid.

So ""WHELM"" is better? Or ""SMEWL""? Not word.

So I choose ""WHELM"".

Now, we are going to guess ""WHELM"". But double-check: positions:
Letter 1: W -> previously W was at 5? Now at position 1? New position? Might be correct? Or if not, we get position information? Good.
Letter 2: H -> new letter? Position 2 not tried? Good.
Letter 3: E -> Previously E at positions 5 and 2? Not 3? So good.
Letter 4: L -> Previously L at position 3? Now at position 4? Good.
Letter 5: M -> new letter? Position 5: previously in crane: E(5) was not present? We mean E was present but not position? Crane: position 5: E, marked '-' meaning E is present but not at 5? The letter was E? Now M is at 5? So no conflict? Good.

Therefore, guessed word: WHELM.

<guess>whelm</guess>From the previous feedback:

**Key Insights from Feedback:**  
1. **Ruled-out letters:** C, R, A, N (from Guess 1), B, O (added from Guess 2). These letters are **not** in the secret word.  
2. **Confirmed present letters:** E, L, W. They must appear in the word but **not** in the positions tested:  
   - E ≠ position 2 or 5 (from Guesses 1–2), so it must be at position 1, 3, or 4.  
   - L ≠ position 3 (from Guess 2), so it must be at position 1, 2, 4, or 5.  
   - W ≠ position 5 (from Guess 2), so it must be at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.  
3. **Untested positions:** Focus on placing E, L, and W in new positions to locate them accurately.  
4. **New letters:** Use remaining letters to test high-frequency consonants/vowels (e.g., H, M, D, S, T).  

**Strategy for This Guess:**  
- **Maximize new information:** Test E at position 3 (untested), L at position 4 (untested), and W at position 1 (untested) to cover new placements efficiently.  
- **Include H and M:** Test two new common letters to expand coverage.  
- **Avoid ruled-out letters:** Skip C, R, A, N, B, O.  

**Chosen Guess: ""WHELM""**  
- **W (position 1):** Tests W at an untested position (previously at 5).  
- **H (position 2):** Tests a new common consonant.  
- **E (position 3):** Probes E at an untested position (previously at 2 and 5).  
- **L (position 4):** Probes L at an untested position (previously at 3).  
- **M (position 5):** Tests a new common consonant.  

This guess efficiently tests all known present letters (E, L, W) in new positions while covering high-frequency new letters (H, M).

<guess>whelm</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: below -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(-) L(-) O(x) W(-)
Guess 3: whelm -> FEEDBACK: W(-) H(x) E(✓) L(✓) M(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for three guesses:

**Guess 1: crane**  
Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)  
Meaning:  
- C, R, A, N are absent from the word.  
- E is present but not at position 5.

**Guess 2: below**  
Feedback: B(x), E(-), L(-), O(x), W(-)  
Meaning:  
- B and O are absent.  
- E is present but not at position 2.  
- L is present but not at position 3.  
- W is present but not at position 5.

**Guess 3: whelm**  
Feedback: W(-), H(x), E(✓), L(✓), M(x)  
Meaning:  
- W is present but not at position 1.  
- H and M are absent.  
- E is correct at position 3.  
- L is correct at position 4.

### Key Conclusions:  
1. **Fixed Positions:**  
   - **Position 3 is E** (from whelm).  
   - **Position 4 is L** (from whelm).  
   So the secret word has the pattern: `_ _ E L _`.

2. **Present Letters:**  
   - **E** (already placed at position 3).  
   - **L** (already placed at position 4).  
   - **W** is present (from below) but not at positions 1 or 5.  
     - Since positions 3 and 4 are now fixed (E and L), W must be in position 2 (only remaining option).

   Confirmed: **Position 2 must be W**?  
   Recall:  
   - W was tested at position 5 (below) → absent → so W not at 5.  
   - W tested at position 1 (whelm) → absent → so W not at 1.  
   - Positions available: 2 and positions 5? But position 5 is open? Word: positions 1,2,3,4,5.  
     - Position 3 and 4 are fixed.  
     - So available positions for W: 1, 2, 5?  
        - Position 1: tried and absent? In whelm: W(-) meaning W present elsewhere? Yes.  
        - Position 5: tried in below and got W(-), meaning present elsewhere? But position in below was position 5? And it was marked ""-"", meaning present but not at position 5? So W is absent from position 5?  
        Therefore, the only open position for W is position 2?  
        Yes! Because positions 1,5 are attempted and rejected? Also position 3 is E? Position 4 is L? So W must be at position 2?  

   But note: position 2 hasn't been tried for W? We know W is present? So it must be at position 2? Therefore, we have:  
   **Position 2 is W**.  
   So the secret word must be: `_ W E L _`.

3. **Absent Letters:**  
   Total ruled out: C, R, A, N, B, O, H, M.  
   From new feedback: H(x) and M(x) from whelm? So add H and M to absent.

   So absent letters: **C, R, A, N, B, O, H, M**.

4. **Remaining Position:**  
   Position 1 and 5 are missing? We need to find the first and last letters?  
   Both must be letters that have not been ruled out? And from the alphabet except the above.

### Remaining Letters to Consider:  
We have placed ""W E L"" in positions 2,3,4? Actually:  
Secret word pattern: `_ W E L _`  
Absent: C,R,A,N,B,O,H,M.  

So the remaining letters:  
D, F, G, I, J, K, P, Q, S, T, U, V, X, Y, Z?  
But common ones: S, T, D, G, P, K, F, etc.

### Next Guess Strategy:  
- We know the word starts and ends with one of the remaining letters?  
- Goal: Test possible options? But we have two positions? We have to cover both position 1 and 5?  
- Also, we need to guess actual words?  
- Since we only need to fill two letters? We have position 1 and 5?  
  And we have many possibilities? So we should choose a word that fits the pattern `? W E L ?`?  

Possible words:  
- SWELL? S W E L L -> But L at the end? But positions: S(1),W(2),E(3),L(4),L(5)? Two L's? But position 5? How?  
- But pattern: position 1=? , position 5=?  

Given we have two positions? We might guess a word that fits?  

But note: We know W is at position 2? E at 3? L at 4?  
But already in whelm? We have L at position 4?  
Now, we need to fill position 1 and 5?  

Common words:  
- DWELL: D W E L L -> D(1), L(5) -> but L at position 5? This duplicates L? But position 4 is L? So position 5 is L?  
  - We don't know? L can be duplicated?  
- SWELL: S W E L L  
- TWELL: Not word?  
- DWELL: Valid?  
- Or with different letters: ""JEWEL""? But J W E E L -> Position: J(1), W(2), E(3), E(4)? But position 4 is already L? So conflict?  
  - Pattern: position 4 must be L? So `? W E L ?`?  
  - So words must have W at 2, E at 3, L at 4?  

Examples:  
- DWELL: D(1), W(2), E(3), L(4), L(5) -> L at position 5?  
- SWELL: S(1), W(2), E(3), L(4), L(5)  
- BUT WELL: 4 letters?  
- ""EXCEL"" but E at 1? And C absent? Avoid C?  
- ""VOWEL"": V O W E L? But O absent? Avoid O?  
- ""TWEED"": T W E E D -> Position: T(1),W(2),E(3),E(4),D(5) -> But position 4 must be L? So E cannot be at 4?  
- Position 4 must be L? So the letter at position 4 is fixed as L?  

Therefore, only words ending with L? Not necessarily? The fifth letter can be anything? But pattern is `? W E L ?`?  

So:  
- DWELL -> duplicated L?  
- SWELL -> duplicated L?  
- DWELL and SWELL are plausible?  
- Others: ""KVELL"": K V E L L? Uncommon?  
- SHELL: S H E L L? But H absent? H from whelm H(x), so avoid H?  
- TELLY? Not 5 letter?  
- YWELM? Not word?  
- ""FIELD"": F I E L D? Position: F(1), I(2), E(3), L(4), D(5) -> I(2) but second letter must be W? So no? We have W at position 2? So nothing else?  

Therefore, the only possibility? Position 2 must be W? So the word must have W at second position?  

But we don't need to test W? We already know?  

Possible words:  
- AWELL? But A absent?  
- EWELD? Not word?  
- ""DWELL"", ""SWELL"", ""KVELL"", etc?  

But note: ""DWELL"" (to dwell). ""SWELL"" (common). Also ""TWELL"", no? How about ""FJELD""? Not common?  

However, there's another common word: ""DWELL"" and ""SWELL""? But both end with L? Are there words that end with something else?  

Pattern: `? W E L ?`?  

For example:  
- ""DWELT"": D W E L T -> D(1), T(5) -> but L at position 4? So word: D W E L T? Yes!  
- Also: ""SWELT""? Not word?  

""DWELT"": verb? Yes.  
Meaning: past tense of dwell?  

Yes!  
Also:  
- TWELD? Not word?  

So possible words:  
- DWELL: `D W E L L` -> last letter L?  
- DWELT: `D W E L T` -> last letter T?  
- SWELL: `S W E L L` -> last letter L?  
- SWELT? Not a word?  
- And ""KWELA""? Not?  

So among these?  
Now, we don't know the last letter? And we have to distinguish?  

In guess 3, M is absent? So if we use words? Also consider we can test letters?  

But we need to guess one?  

Available letters? Position 1: D or S or ...?  
Position 5: L or T? But L? If we have two letters?  

How to test?  

Given we have one guess? We can guess one candidate?  
We have 3 possibilities?  
- If position 5 is L? Then words: DWELL, SWELL  
- If position 5 is T? Then DWELT?  

Now, we need to cover position 1 and 5?  

But we haven't tested D, S, T, etc?  

Since we know positions 2,3,4 are fixed? And position 1 and 5 are unknown?  

We can test a word that tests position 1 and 5?  

But we must use actual words?  

For example, we can try ""DWELT"":  
If correct? Then we win?  
If not? Then feedback would tell us?  

But note: we have multiple possibilities?  
We can also try ""SWELL""?  

Let's think:  
Since we know position 2,3,4: W,E,L?  
Position 1: possibilities: D, S, T? Or K? Or V? etc?  
Position 5: possibilities: L, T, D? But etc?  

Wait, but we don't know duplicates?  

In ""DWELT"": the letter D is at position 1? T at 5?  
In ""DWELL"": D at 1? L at 5?  
In ""SWELL"": S at 1? L at 5?  

Also: ""JEWEL""? But J at 1? W at 2? E at 3? L at 4? What at 5? But ""JEWEL"" has E at 4? We have L at 4?  
Position 4 must be L?  

Another word: ""LEVEL""? But L at position 1? And position 4? But pattern: L(1) W(2) E(3) L(4) ...? But position 5?  
Position 5: L? Then ""LEVEL"": L,E,V,E,L? Not matching? Because position 2 must be W?  

So only possibilities:  
- DWELT  
- DWELL  
- SWELL  
- SWELT? Not word?  
- TWELL? Not word?  

So DWELT, DWELL, SWELL?  

Also: ""CREWL""? C absent?  
""BREWL""? B absent?  
""YWELL""? Not word?  

So we have three candidates?  

But we can try one? For example, ""DWELT"" might be a candidate?  

Now, from feedback? We don't know position 1 and 5?  

But we have 6 guesses? We've used 3? So 3 remaining?  

We can try ""DWELT""?  

If correct? Then we win?  
Else? Feedback will tell us.  

If we guess ""DWELT""? The feedback might reveal?  

But note: if the word is ""DWELL"", then when we guess ""DWELT"", what feedback?  
Pattern:  
D: if correct? Position 1? Same?  
W: ✓  
E:✓  
L:✓  
T: if position 5? Secret is ""DWELL"": position 5 is L? So T vs L? So T is absent? Because L is already placed at 4? Wait? The secret: D W E L L?  
Then our guess: D W E L T?  
So:  
Position 1: D(✓)  
Position 2: W(✓)  
Position 3: E(✓)  
Position 4: L(✓)  
Position 5: T vs L? But in secret, L is at position 5? So T is not in the word? Unless there are two T's? But we don't have T?  
In ""DWELT"", T is guessed? Secret ""DWELL"": has L at 5? So T? Not in the word? So T(x)?  
Similarly?  

If secret ""SWELL"":  
Guess ""DWELT"":  
Position 1: D vs S? S absent? D absent? Both S and D may be? We don't know D?  
Position 1: D? Secret S? So D absent? Unless S==D?  
Then D(x)  
Then W(✓)  
E(✓)  
L(✓)  
T? If secret ""SWELL"": L at position 5? T not present? So T(x)?  

Therefore? If we guess ""DWELT""?  

If the secret is ""DWELT"": we'll get D(✓),W(✓),E(✓),L(✓),T(✓)  
If secret ""DWELL"": D(✓),W(✓),E(✓),L(✓),T(x) -> because T not in word?  
If secret ""SWELL"": D(x) -> D absent? Because S is at position 1? Then W(✓),E(✓),L(✓),T(x)?  

So by trying ""DWELT"":  
- If we get D(✓) and T(✓)? Then win?  
- If we get T(x) and D(✓)? Then it must be ""DWELL""?  
- If we get D(x) and T(x)? Then it might be ""SWELL""?  
But position 1 D(x) means D not in word? Then secret could be ""SWELL""?  

But we have more guesses? So we can do?  
Given one guess? We can solve?  

Alternatively? Choose a word that tests the first letter?  

But we know the pattern? So guess ""DWELT""?  

We might also note: In all candidates:  
Position 5 is either L or T?  
If position 5 is L, then word ends with L?  

But we don't know?  

Given efficiency? We can choose ""DWELT""?  

But there might be another word? For example, ""SWELT""? Not word?  

Or ""TWELF""? Not?  

So guessed word: DWELT?  

But first? We are allowed only one guess?  

Let me confirm?  
Secret word: possibilities DWELT, DWELL, SWELL?  

Also?  

Another possibility: ""KWELL""? K W E L L?  
Uncommon? But possible?  

Or ""VLEW""? Not?  

But let's stick to common?  

Given feedback? We can test?  

Also? We have E(✓) at position 3? L(✓) at position 4?  
So positions fixed?  

Therefore? I choose ""DWELT""?  

But note: in whlem? M absent? So no problem?  

So let's guess ""DWELT""  

If wrong? Feedback will help us?  

We have only 3 guesses left? This is the fourth?  
We have used 3? Fourth guess?  

So no risk?  

Therefore? guessed word: DWELT  

Return: <guess>dwelt</guess>  

But note: if the secret is ""DWELL""? Then it will be?  
We can see?  

But let's do it.### Step-by-Step Thought Process:

1. **Analyzing Previous Feedback:**
   - **Guess 1 (crane):** C, R, A, N are absent (x). E is present (-) but not at position 5.
   - **Guess 2 (below):** B and O are absent (x). E is present (-) but not at position 2. L is present (-) but not at position 3. W is present (-) but not at position 5.
   - **Guess 3 (whelm):** H and M are absent (x). E is correct at position 3 (✓). L is correct at position 4 (✓). W is present (-) but not at position 1.
   
2. **Key Inferences:**
   - Positions 3 and 4 are fixed: **E** (position 3) and **L** (position 4). So the secret word pattern is: `_ _ E L _`.
   - **W is present** and must be in position 2 (since it cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 based on feedback). Thus, the pattern is: `_ W E L _`.
   - Ruled-out letters: **C, R, A, N, B, O, H, M** (absent in feedback).
   - **Unknown positions:** Position 1 and 5 need to be filled with unused letters.
   - Remaining candidate letters (not ruled out): **D, F, G, I, J, K, P, Q, S, T, U, V, X, Y, Z**.

3. **Generating Possible Words:**
   - Secret word must match `? W E L ?` and be a valid English word.
   - Top candidates:
     - **DWELT**: D at position 1, T at position 5.
     - **DWELL**: D at position 1, L at position 5 (duplicate L, possible).
     - **SWELL**: S at position 1, L at position 5 (duplicate L).
   - Other options (less common) like KWELL or JEWEL are ruled out (K/J not tested but pattern fits).

4. **Strategy for This Guess:**
   - Focus on testing **position 5** with a letter that distinguishes between candidates (e.g., T in DWELT vs. L in DWELL/SWELL).
   - Guess **DWELT**:
     - If T is correct (✓), the word is DWELT.
     - If T is absent (x), it confirms position 5 ends with L (likely DWELL or SWELL), narrowing to position 1 options (D or S).
     - Guessing DWELT provides maximum information and resolves ambiguity efficiently.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - **DWELT** is the optimal guess—it tests position 1 (D) and position 5 (T) while fitting known constraints. This leverages existing feedback and maximizes progress toward the solution.

And it does contain E, but not at the end.\n\n We need to make a second guess that maximizes information. We should avoid using C, R, A, N.\n\n Since E is in the word, we can try a word that includes E and other common letters that haven\'t been ruled out.\n\n Let\'s think of letters that are still possible: We\'ve ruled out C,R,A,N. So we have the rest of the alphabet.\n\n Common letters we can use: B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n But note: E is already confirmed, so we should definitely include E again. Since E is not in the 5th position, we can put E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n Also, we want to test other vowels and common consonants. The word should have E and avoid C,R,A,N.\n\n Possible choices: We can try words like ""SPIEL"", ""FIELD"", ""SHIED"", ""TOWED"", etc. However, we want a word that has as many new letters as possible.\n\n Let\'s consider ""DEUCE"" but note it has C (which is ruled out) and E is repeated? Also ""DEUCE"" has C which is not allowed.\n\n Other choices: We can try ""ELBOW"", but E is at the beginning and we don\'t know if that\'s correct. However, we are trying to find the position of E.\n\n Since E is not in the 5th position, let\'s try putting E in the 4th position? Or we can try a word with E in different positions to test.\n\n We should avoid using letters that have been ruled out: C, R, A, N.\n\n Another idea: Since E is the only known letter, we can try a word that has E in the first position? But note the feedback only said E is present but not in 5th. It could be in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.\n\n We don\'t have much information, so a good strategy is to use a word with E and other common letters that we haven\'t tried.\n\n Let me list some words without C,R,A,N and with E:\n - ""TIMES"": T, I, M, E, S -> E is in the 4th position.\n - ""FIELD"": F, I, E, L, D -> E in 3rd.\n - ""DOZEN"": D, O, Z, E, N -> but N is ruled out? N was ruled out (it was marked x), so we cannot use N.\n\n Important: We must not use N because it\'s not in the word.\n\n So avoid: C, R, A, N.\n\n Let me try to find a word without these and including E.\n\n Common words: \n - ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> E at the end? But feedback for E was \'-\' meaning it should be in the word but not at the end? Actually, ""crane"" had E at the 5th position and it was wrong. So E could be at a different position. But note: we can put E at the end again? No, because the feedback said it\'s not in the correct position, meaning it\'s not at the 5th position. So if we put E at the 5th in the next guess, we know it will be marked as absent (or wrong position if it actually is in the word but at the 5th? But wait: the secret word has E but not at position 5. That means position 5 is not E. So we shouldn\'t put E at position 5 again because it\'s not there.\n\n Therefore, we should try E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n For the next guess, we can try E in a new position? But we don\'t know which position is correct.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in a different position and test other common letters.\n\n Another idea: We also need to find the other letters. We\'ve only identified E so far.\n\n Since we have 4 letters ruled out (C,R,A,N), we have a lot of letters to choose from.\n\n I propose ""SPIEL"": \n   S, P, I, E, L\n   E is at position 4.\n\n But note: E was tried at position 5 and was wrong. Now we are trying at position 4. If we get E at position 4 marked as correct or wrong position, we\'ll know.\n\n Another word: ""TIMES"" has E at position 5? Wait: ""TIMES"" ends with S? Actually ""TIMES"" is T-I-M-E-S, so E is at position 4? No: \n positions: \n  T (1), I(2), M(3), E(4), S(5)\n\n Actually ""TIMES"" has E at position 4 and S at 5.\n\n But we can use ""TIMES"": it doesn\'t contain C,R,A,N.\n\n However, what if the word has S? We don\'t know. We haven\'t tested S.\n\n Alternatively, we can use ""HOUSE"", but E at the end? That is position 5. But we know E is not at position 5. So avoid words that have E at position 5.\n\n So ""TIMES"" has E at position 4? Actually: \n T -> pos1, I->2, M->3, E->4, S->5 -> So E is at position 4? But wait: is the word 5 letters? Yes.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if E is at position 4 until we try.\n\n Another word: ""STOLE"" - S(1), T(2), O(3), L(4), E(5) -> E at 5? We cannot do that because E cannot be at 5.\n\n So let\'s try ""SLEPT"": but S,L,E,P,T -> E is at position 3? Okay.\n\n But we haven\'t tested P and T.\n\n Alternatively, ""OWLET"": O,W,L,E,T -> E at position 4? And avoids C,R,A,N? Yes.\n\n But ""OWLET"" might be less common.\n\n Another common word: ""PILED"": P, I, L, E, D. E is at position 4? Actually: P(1), I(2), L(3), E(4), D(5). So E is at 4.\n\n We should consider including as many new letters as possible.\n\n Let me think: we have 6 tries. We have one known letter (E) and 4 forbidden letters (C,R,A,N). We need to cover more letters.\n\n I think ""TOWED"" is a candidate: T, O, W, E, D -> E at position 4? Actually: T(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), D(5). Also, no C,R,A,N.\n\n But we have used: in first guess: C,R,A,N,E -> so for second guess, we are using T, O, W, E, D.\n\n That seems okay: we are testing 4 new letters (T,O,W,D) plus E in a new position (4).\n\n We can also consider ""BELOW"": B,E,L,O,W -> E at position 2? And without C,R,A,N? Yes.\n\n Since E wasn\'t at position 5, we might as well try it at position 2? Then we can test B,L,O,W.\n\n But which position for E is more likely? We don\'t know, but we are trying to get information.\n\n Let\'s compare:\n\n Option 1: ""TOWED"" -> E at position 4, letters T,O,W,D.\n Option 2: ""BELOW"" -> E at position 2, letters B,L,O,W.\n\n Both are valid.\n\n Another common word: ""BLUES"" -> but E at position 5? Avoid.\n\n Another: ""FLESH"": F,L,E,S,H -> E at position 3.\n\n We can go with ""BELOW"": \n   B, E, L, O, W\n\n E is in the second position.\n\n But note: if E is actually in position 2, we\'ll get a ✓. If in another position, we\'ll get a - or even if it\'s not in position 2 but present, we get -.\n\n Let me choose ""BELOW"" because it tests E in a new position (position 2) and includes common letters.\n\n Alternatively, to cover more vowels? BELOW has O, which is a vowel.\n\n We could try ""QUERY"" but Q is uncommon and U,E,R (R is ruled out? R was in first guess and marked x, so no). So we cannot use R.\n\n Wait, R is ruled out? Yes, from first feedback: R(x) -> not in the word. So avoid R.\n\n So ""QUERY"" has R -> invalid? We cannot use R.\n\n So stick to words without C,R,A,N.\n\n I think ""BELOW"" is acceptable.\n\n But note: we have to use only English words and 5 letters.\n\n Let me confirm: BELOW is a valid word.\n\n Alternatively, ""SLEEK"" has E\'s, but note E at positions 3 and 4? But we don\'t know if there are multiple E\'s? We haven\'t got any indication of multiple E\'s. The word could have multiple E\'s? But we only know one E is present. Also, we can try words with repeated letters? But to maximize information, we avoid repeats.\n\n So ""SLEEK"" has two E\'s? And S and K are new? But we don\'t know if L is in.\n\n But I think for maximum information, avoid repeated letters.\n\n So ""BELOW"" is without repeated letters and tests 4 new letters: B, L, O, W.\n\n We already know E is present, so this word has E and 4 new letters.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""BELOW"".\n\n Let me write it: B E L O W.\n\n But note: positions: \n  1: B\n  2: E\n  3: L\n  4: O\n  5: W\n\n We will see if E is in position 2? If we get E(✓) that would be great. Otherwise, we might get E(-) meaning E is in the word but not at position 2 (but then it\'s in position 1,3,4? but wait, we tried position 5 and it was wrong, so remaining positions 1,3,4). But note: if E is in position 1, then in BELOW, position 2 would be not E, so it would be marked as \'-\' only if E is actually in the word but not at position 2? Actually, no: if E is in position 1 and we have E at position 2, then for position 1 (B) we don\'t know and E at position 2 would be marked as \'-\'? No: wait the marking is per letter.\n\n Actually, the feedback is per slot. So for the second slot: if the second letter of the secret word is not E, but E is in the word elsewhere, then we will see E(-). And if the secret word has E at position 1, then the B in our guess at position 1 would get checked: if it\'s E? no, it\'s B. So B at position 1 would be x (if secret word doesn\'t have B) or - (if secret word has B but not at start) or ✓ (if the secret word starts with B). Similarly, E at position 2: if secret word has something else at position 2, then we get E in the word? we know E is in the word, but we don\'t know where.\n\n I think ""BELOW"" is a reasonable guess.\n\n Alternatively, we might choose a word that has E in a slot we want to test, and other common letters.\n\n Another word: ""ETUDE"" -> but E is repeated? Avoid repetition. Also T and D are new? But we avoid repeated E.\n\n We\'ll go with ""BELOW"".\n\n<guess>below</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  \n- C, R, A, N are **absent** from the secret word (marked x).  \n- E is **present** but **not in the 5th position** (marked -).  \n\nThis means:  \n- The secret word contains E but not at the end (positions 1–4).  \n- Avoid using C, R, A, N in subsequent guesses.  \n\nFor the second guess:  \n- Prioritize testing E in positions 1–4 to locate its correct position.  \n- Use high-frequency letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, O, L, D, B) and avoid C, R, A, N.  \n- Choose a word with E in a new position (e.g., position 2) and maximize new letter coverage.  \n\nSelected guess: **""BELOW""**  \n- **B**: Tests a new common consonant at position 1.  \n- **E**: Tests E at position 2, helping identify its true location.  \n- **L, O**: Tests two common vowels/consonants at positions 3 and 4.  \n- **W**: Tests a less common letter at position 5.  \n\nThis guess efficiently covers 4 new letters (B, L, O, W) while continuing to probe E\'s position.\n\n<guess>below</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: below -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(-) L(-) O(x) W(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nMeaning: \n- C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.\n- E is in the word but not at position 5 (where it was in ""crane"").\n\nGuess 2: below -> B(x) E(-) L(-) O(x) W(-)\nMeaning:\n- B is not in the word at all.\n- E is in the word but not at position 2 (where we guessed it).\n- L is in the word but not at position 3.\n- O is not in the word at all.\n- W is in the word but not at position 5.\n\nNow, combining information:\n\nLetters ruled out: C, R, A, N, B, O. These are definitely not in the word.\n\nLetters confirmed present: E, L, W.\n\nWe know:\n- E is present and not at position 2 or 5.\n- L is present and not at position 3.\n- W is present and not at position 5.\n\nFrom the first guess, E is not at position 5. Now in the second guess, E was tried at position 2 and is not there. So E must be at position 1, 3, or 4.\n\nSimilarly, L was tried at position 3 and not there, so L is at position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\nW was tried at position 5 and not there, so W is at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nWe have 6 tries total and we\'ve used 2, so 4 remaining.\n\nOur goal: choose a word that:\n- Includes E, L, W (since we know they are present).\n- Does NOT include C,R,A,N,B,O (ruled out).\n- Tries E,L,W in positions they haven\'t been tried yet to locate them.\n\nAdditionally, we must identify two more letters (since the word is 5 letters).\n\nPossible letters: We\'ve used C,R,A,N,E,B,L,O,W. So remaining: D,F,G,H,I,J,K,M,P,Q,S,T,U,V,X,Y,Z.\n\nBut common letters: S, T, D, P, M, H, I, etc.\n\nWe must form a 5-letter word with E,L,W and two other letters from the remaining, avoiding the ruled-out letters.\n\nGiven E must be at position 1,3, or 4; L must be at position 1,2,4, or5; W at position 1,2,3,4.\n\nWe want to design a word that positions these in conflict with previous placements? Not necessarily conflict, but to test new positions.\n\nFor example, we might try E at position 1 or 3 or 4. Similarly for L and W.\n\nBut we don\'t have many positions left to test without using multiple letters at once.\n\nSince we have E,L,W all present, we might try a word that has these three and positions them in different places.\n\nPossible words: For example:\n\n- Position E at 1: EL, then... possible words? E L W must all fit.\n\nCommon words: ""SWELL"" but L is repeated? And we don\'t know if duplicates exist. Also, SWELL has S,W,E,L,L -> two L\'s? We don\'t know.\n\nBut to avoid complexity, we should probably avoid duplicates? Unless we are forced.\n\nAnother: ""DWELT"" - D W E L T -> E at position 3? But T is new.\n\nBut let\'s check positions:\n\nWe need to test E in position 1,3,4? And avoid positions 2 and 5.\n\nSimilarly, L avoid position 3? We also need to place L.\n\nW avoid position 5? And we haven\'t tested positions 1,2,3,4.\n\nPerhaps a word that positions E at 4 (to test one possibility) and L at 1, and W at 2? For example: ""L W _ E _"" but that might not form a word.\n\nConsider the word ""WELSH"": W,E,L,S,H -> positions: \n- W at 1? \n- E at 2? \n- L at 3? \n- S at 4? \n- H at 5? \n\nBut note: for E, we know E is not at position 2 (from below feedback). So we cannot put E at position 2 again? We can, but if we put it at position 2, we know it\'s not there. So it would be a waste? Unless we want to confirm? But we already know it\'s not at 2. So we shouldn\'t place E at positions we know it\'s not.\n\nTherefore, avoid position 2 and 5 for E? But position 5 we know from both? Position 5 for E: from crane and W from below? But below W was at 5? But E wasn\'t tried at 5 here? No, we haven\'t tried E at 5 again? In below, E is at 2. Only positions 1,3,4 are available for E.\n\nSimilarly, avoid for L: position 3 (already tried). So L can be at 1,2,4,5.\n\nFor W: avoid position 5 (tried and not there). So W can be at 1,2,3,4.\n\nTherefore, ""WELSH"" has E at position 2? But we know E isn\'t at position 2? So it will come back as E(-) again? But we know it\'s present. But position 2 we already tried and failed. So it wastes one position without testing a new possibility.\n\nWe should avoid putting E at position 2.\n\nSimilarly, avoid putting L at position 3? Yes.\n\nSo we cannot use ""WELSH"" because E at position 2 is invalid.\n\nLet me try a word that has E in position 1: e.g., ""ELMWO""? Not an English word.\n\nPosition E at 3: e.g., ""__ E __""\n\nPossible words: ""SLEW"" is 4 letters? Need 5.\n\nSo 5 letters: How about ""AGILE""? But A is ruled out? We cannot use A (from crane A(x)).\n\nOr ""DEALS"": D,E,A,L,S? But A is ruled out.\n\nWe must avoid ruled out letters: B,C,N,R,O,A are ruled out? From crane: C,R,A,N and below: B,O.\n\nSo avoid: A,B,C,N,O,R.\n\nRemaining: D,F,G,H,I,J,K,M,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z\n\nAnd we have E,L,W to include.\n\nSo word must contain E,L,W and two of the above.\n\nNow, try E in position 1: \nPossible: E _ _ _ _\nWords: EGRET? But has R? R ruled out? R from crane was R(x), so avoid R? Yes. \nELVES: E L V E S? Duplicate E? Not ideal. \nEDGES: E D G E S? Two E\'s. \nEJECT? E J E C T? But C ruled out? C(x) from crane, so avoid C? EJECT has J and T? But E in position 1 and 3? \n\nBetter: Single E? So ""EMPTY"": E M P T Y? but no L,W? Must have E,L,W.\n\nSo must include E,L,W.\n\nE at 1: What words start with E and have L and W? \n\nExamples: ""ELBOW"" but O and B ruled out? B(x) and O(x) from below. \nSo no. \n""ELDOW""? Not word.\n\nNot many words: ""ELM"" then? Short.\n\nE at 1, then at position 3? E _ L _ _\n\nWords: ""SPLIT"" but no E? Must have E.\n\nSo E at 1, L at 3: ""E L _ _ "" with W somewhere?\n\n""ELDER"": E L D E R? Two E\'s and R? Avoid R? \n""ELMEN""? Not word.\n\n""ELPIS""? Not word.\n\nPerhaps E at 4? e.g., ""___ E _"" \n\nWords: Possible ""FILE_""? ""FILES"" but F,I,L,E,S? L at 3? And E at 4? Then position 5: W? But W is already in? No, we need W somewhere.\n\n""FLUME"" but has U? F,L,U,M,E? Position E at 5? But E cannot be at 5? So position E at 5 is invalid? We know E is not at position 5, so avoid.\n\nSo E must be at 1,3,4? Similarly W can be at 1,2,3,4? L at 1,2,4,5.\n\nTry E in position 3: \nPattern: _ _ E _ _\n\nPossible: Place W in position 1? W _ E _ _ \n\nWords: ""WHELM"" but W,H,E,L,M? Positions: W(1), H(2), E(3), L(4), M(5). This seems okay.\n\n""WHELM"" means something? It comes from ""Whelm"", a verb meaning to engulf or bury? But it\'s 5-letter: ""WHELM"".\n\nAnother: ""SWE?L"": ""SWELL"" with E at 3? S W E L L? Two L\'s? And W at 2? \n\nBut ""SWELL"": S,W,E,L,L -> E at position 3? But two L\'s? We don\'t know if L is duplicated? Possible.\n\nBut to avoid complication, single L? \n\nSo ""WHELM"": W(1),H(2),E(3),L(4),M(5). This contains:\n- W at 1: not tried before (W was tried at 5 only? In ""below"", W at 5: so position 1 new)\n- E at 3: E was tried at 5 and 2? But not 3? So new position? And E at 3? We know E can be at 1,3,4? So yes.\n- L at 4: L was tried at 3? Now at 4? New position? Avoid positions tried? Previous L was at position 3? So position 4 is new? Then yes.\n\nAlso includes H and M? New letters.\n\nAnd avoids prohibited letters? Check: C,R,A,N,B,O? No.\n\nLet me verify: \n- C: not used? Avoids. \n- R: not? Avoids. \n- A: avoids. \n- N: avoids. \n- B: avoids. \n- O: avoids.\n\nSo ""WHELM"" is an English word? Yes.\n\nAlternative: ""DWELL"": D W E L L? Again two L\'s? And E at position 3? And L at 4? But duplicate L.? \n\nSimilarly, ""TWELL""? Not really? ""Dwale""? Not.\n\nSo ""WHELM"" seems acceptable.\n\nNow, we also saw in ""WHELM"", W is at position 1? Previously W was only at position 5? So new position? And H at 2? New letter? And E at 3? New? L at 4? New (previously L at position 3)? And M at position 5? New? All letters tested? \n\nBut note: in ""below"", we had W at 5 and now we have W at 1? But if W is in the word, we are testing a new position? We know W is present? So if W is at position 1? Then we get ✓? If not, then we get (-) meaning W is elsewhere? Similarly for E and L.\n\nMoreover, we are testing two new letters H and M.\n\nSo ""WHELM"" seems good.\n\nAnother word: How about ""WHILE""? But has I and L? And E? E at position 3? W at position 1? H at 2? Then WHILE: W,H,I,L,E -> E at position 5? Oh wait? Positions: \nW(1), H(2), I(3), L(4), E(5)? E at 5? But E cannot be at 5? We know E is not at position 5? So we mustn\'t put E at 5? Therefore, ""WHILE"" puts E at 5? Invalid placement? Because we know E is not at 5? So in ""WHILE"", if E is at 5, we would get E(x) meaning not present? But we know E is present? So conflicting? Actually, no: if E is at 5, we know it shouldn\'t be there? But the word might have E at 5? No, we know from ""crane"" that E is in the word but not at position 5? So secret word does not have E at position 5. Therefore, we shouldn\'t put E at position 5? Because we know it will be marked as \'-\' at best? But no: if we put E at 5 and secret word has E elsewhere? Then we get E(-) meaning present? But position 5? Since we know position 5 isn\'t E, we can avoid? \n\nBut more importantly, we don\'t want to waste a position for E? It\'s better not to test known impossible?\n\nSpecifically: from feedback, the secret word has E but not at position 5. So any guess with E at position 5? Then E at position 5 would be marked as \'-\' meaning present? Because it\'s not correct? But we already know that? So it doesn\'t give us new information about position? And we don\'t test the actual position? So we avoid.\n\nTherefore, ""WHILE"" has E at 5? We skip.\n\nAnother possibility: ""FLUTE""? But F,L,U,T,E? And E at 5? Avoid.\n\nSo ""WHELM"" is better? Or ""SMEWL""? Not word.\n\nSo I choose ""WHELM"".\n\nNow, we are going to guess ""WHELM"". But double-check: positions:\nLetter 1: W -> previously W was at 5? Now at position 1? New position? Might be correct? Or if not, we get position information? Good.\nLetter 2: H -> new letter? Position 2 not tried? Good.\nLetter 3: E -> Previously E at positions 5 and 2? Not 3? So good.\nLetter 4: L -> Previously L at position 3? Now at position 4? Good.\nLetter 5: M -> new letter? Position 5: previously in crane: E(5) was not present? We mean E was present but not position? Crane: position 5: E, marked \'-\' meaning E is present but not at 5? The letter was E? Now M is at 5? So no conflict? Good.\n\nTherefore, guessed word: WHELM.\n\n<guess>whelm</guess>From the previous feedback:\n\n**Key Insights from Feedback:**  \n1. **Ruled-out letters:** C, R, A, N (from Guess 1), B, O (added from Guess 2). These letters are **not** in the secret word.  \n2. **Confirmed present letters:** E, L, W. They must appear in the word but **not** in the positions tested:  \n   - E ≠ position 2 or 5 (from Guesses 1–2), so it must be at position 1, 3, or 4.  \n   - L ≠ position 3 (from Guess 2), so it must be at position 1, 2, 4, or 5.  \n   - W ≠ position 5 (from Guess 2), so it must be at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.  \n3. **Untested positions:** Focus on placing E, L, and W in new positions to locate them accurately.  \n4. **New letters:** Use remaining letters to test high-frequency consonants/vowels (e.g., H, M, D, S, T).  \n\n**Strategy for This Guess:**  \n- **Maximize new information:** Test E at position 3 (untested), L at position 4 (untested), and W at position 1 (untested) to cover new placements efficiently.  \n- **Include H and M:** Test two new common letters to expand coverage.  \n- **Avoid ruled-out letters:** Skip C, R, A, N, B, O.  \n\n**Chosen Guess: ""WHELM""**  \n- **W (position 1):** Tests W at an untested position (previously at 5).  \n- **H (position 2):** Tests a new common consonant.  \n- **E (position 3):** Probes E at an untested position (previously at 2 and 5).  \n- **L (position 4):** Probes L at an untested position (previously at 3).  \n- **M (position 5):** Tests a new common consonant.  \n\nThis guess efficiently tests all known present letters (E, L, W) in new positions while covering high-frequency new letters (H, M).\n\n<guess>whelm</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: below -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(-) L(-) O(x) W(-)\nGuess 3: whelm -> FEEDBACK: W(-) H(x) E(✓) L(✓) M(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for three guesses:\n\n**Guess 1: crane**  \nFeedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)  \nMeaning:  \n- C, R, A, N are absent from the word.  \n- E is present but not at position 5.\n\n**Guess 2: below**  \nFeedback: B(x), E(-), L(-), O(x), W(-)  \nMeaning:  \n- B and O are absent.  \n- E is present but not at position 2.  \n- L is present but not at position 3.  \n- W is present but not at position 5.\n\n**Guess 3: whelm**  \nFeedback: W(-), H(x), E(✓), L(✓), M(x)  \nMeaning:  \n- W is present but not at position 1.  \n- H and M are absent.  \n- E is correct at position 3.  \n- L is correct at position 4.\n\n### Key Conclusions:  \n1. **Fixed Positions:**  \n   - **Position 3 is E** (from whelm).  \n   - **Position 4 is L** (from whelm).  \n   So the secret word has the pattern: `_ _ E L _`.\n\n2. **Present Letters:**  \n   - **E** (already placed at position 3).  \n   - **L** (already placed at position 4).  \n   - **W** is present (from below) but not at positions 1 or 5.  \n     - Since positions 3 and 4 are now fixed (E and L), W must be in position 2 (only remaining option).\n\n   Confirmed: **Position 2 must be W**?  \n   Recall:  \n   - W was tested at position 5 (below) → absent → so W not at 5.  \n   - W tested at position 1 (whelm) → absent → so W not at 1.  \n   - Positions available: 2 and positions 5? But position 5 is open? Word: positions 1,2,3,4,5.  \n     - Position 3 and 4 are fixed.  \n     - So available positions for W: 1, 2, 5?  \n        - Position 1: tried and absent? In whelm: W(-) meaning W present elsewhere? Yes.  \n        - Position 5: tried in below and got W(-), meaning present elsewhere? But position in below was position 5? And it was marked ""-"", meaning present but not at position 5? So W is absent from position 5?  \n        Therefore, the only open position for W is position 2?  \n        Yes! Because positions 1,5 are attempted and rejected? Also position 3 is E? Position 4 is L? So W must be at position 2?  \n\n   But note: position 2 hasn\'t been tried for W? We know W is present? So it must be at position 2? Therefore, we have:  \n   **Position 2 is W**.  \n   So the secret word must be: `_ W E L _`.\n\n3. **Absent Letters:**  \n   Total ruled out: C, R, A, N, B, O, H, M.  \n   From new feedback: H(x) and M(x) from whelm? So add H and M to absent.\n\n   So absent letters: **C, R, A, N, B, O, H, M**.\n\n4. **Remaining Position:**  \n   Position 1 and 5 are missing? We need to find the first and last letters?  \n   Both must be letters that have not been ruled out? And from the alphabet except the above.\n\n### Remaining Letters to Consider:  \nWe have placed ""W E L"" in positions 2,3,4? Actually:  \nSecret word pattern: `_ W E L _`  \nAbsent: C,R,A,N,B,O,H,M.  \n\nSo the remaining letters:  \nD, F, G, I, J, K, P, Q, S, T, U, V, X, Y, Z?  \nBut common ones: S, T, D, G, P, K, F, etc.\n\n### Next Guess Strategy:  \n- We know the word starts and ends with one of the remaining letters?  \n- Goal: Test possible options? But we have two positions? We have to cover both position 1 and 5?  \n- Also, we need to guess actual words?  \n- Since we only need to fill two letters? We have position 1 and 5?  \n  And we have many possibilities? So we should choose a word that fits the pattern `? W E L ?`?  \n\nPossible words:  \n- SWELL? S W E L L -> But L at the end? But positions: S(1),W(2),E(3),L(4),L(5)? Two L\'s? But position 5? How?  \n- But pattern: position 1=? , position 5=?  \n\nGiven we have two positions? We might guess a word that fits?  \n\nBut note: We know W is at position 2? E at 3? L at 4?  \nBut already in whelm? We have L at position 4?  \nNow, we need to fill position 1 and 5?  \n\nCommon words:  \n- DWELL: D W E L L -> D(1), L(5) -> but L at position 5? This duplicates L? But position 4 is L? So position 5 is L?  \n  - We don\'t know? L can be duplicated?  \n- SWELL: S W E L L  \n- TWELL: Not word?  \n- DWELL: Valid?  \n- Or with different letters: ""JEWEL""? But J W E E L -> Position: J(1), W(2), E(3), E(4)? But position 4 is already L? So conflict?  \n  - Pattern: position 4 must be L? So `? W E L ?`?  \n  - So words must have W at 2, E at 3, L at 4?  \n\nExamples:  \n- DWELL: D(1), W(2), E(3), L(4), L(5) -> L at position 5?  \n- SWELL: S(1), W(2), E(3), L(4), L(5)  \n- BUT WELL: 4 letters?  \n- ""EXCEL"" but E at 1? And C absent? Avoid C?  \n- ""VOWEL"": V O W E L? But O absent? Avoid O?  \n- ""TWEED"": T W E E D -> Position: T(1),W(2),E(3),E(4),D(5) -> But position 4 must be L? So E cannot be at 4?  \n- Position 4 must be L? So the letter at position 4 is fixed as L?  \n\nTherefore, only words ending with L? Not necessarily? The fifth letter can be anything? But pattern is `? W E L ?`?  \n\nSo:  \n- DWELL -> duplicated L?  \n- SWELL -> duplicated L?  \n- DWELL and SWELL are plausible?  \n- Others: ""KVELL"": K V E L L? Uncommon?  \n- SHELL: S H E L L? But H absent? H from whelm H(x), so avoid H?  \n- TELLY? Not 5 letter?  \n- YWELM? Not word?  \n- ""FIELD"": F I E L D? Position: F(1), I(2), E(3), L(4), D(5) -> I(2) but second letter must be W? So no? We have W at position 2? So nothing else?  \n\nTherefore, the only possibility? Position 2 must be W? So the word must have W at second position?  \n\nBut we don\'t need to test W? We already know?  \n\nPossible words:  \n- AWELL? But A absent?  \n- EWELD? Not word?  \n- ""DWELL"", ""SWELL"", ""KVELL"", etc?  \n\nBut note: ""DWELL"" (to dwell). ""SWELL"" (common). Also ""TWELL"", no? How about ""FJELD""? Not common?  \n\nHowever, there\'s another common word: ""DWELL"" and ""SWELL""? But both end with L? Are there words that end with something else?  \n\nPattern: `? W E L ?`?  \n\nFor example:  \n- ""DWELT"": D W E L T -> D(1), T(5) -> but L at position 4? So word: D W E L T? Yes!  \n- Also: ""SWELT""? Not word?  \n\n""DWELT"": verb? Yes.  \nMeaning: past tense of dwell?  \n\nYes!  \nAlso:  \n- TWELD? Not word?  \n\nSo possible words:  \n- DWELL: `D W E L L` -> last letter L?  \n- DWELT: `D W E L T` -> last letter T?  \n- SWELL: `S W E L L` -> last letter L?  \n- SWELT? Not a word?  \n- And ""KWELA""? Not?  \n\nSo among these?  \nNow, we don\'t know the last letter? And we have to distinguish?  \n\nIn guess 3, M is absent? So if we use words? Also consider we can test letters?  \n\nBut we need to guess one?  \n\nAvailable letters? Position 1: D or S or ...?  \nPosition 5: L or T? But L? If we have two letters?  \n\nHow to test?  \n\nGiven we have one guess? We can guess one candidate?  \nWe have 3 possibilities?  \n- If position 5 is L? Then words: DWELL, SWELL  \n- If position 5 is T? Then DWELT?  \n\nNow, we need to cover position 1 and 5?  \n\nBut we haven\'t tested D, S, T, etc?  \n\nSince we know positions 2,3,4 are fixed? And position 1 and 5 are unknown?  \n\nWe can test a word that tests position 1 and 5?  \n\nBut we must use actual words?  \n\nFor example, we can try ""DWELT"":  \nIf correct? Then we win?  \nIf not? Then feedback would tell us?  \n\nBut note: we have multiple possibilities?  \nWe can also try ""SWELL""?  \n\nLet\'s think:  \nSince we know position 2,3,4: W,E,L?  \nPosition 1: possibilities: D, S, T? Or K? Or V? etc?  \nPosition 5: possibilities: L, T, D? But etc?  \n\nWait, but we don\'t know duplicates?  \n\nIn ""DWELT"": the letter D is at position 1? T at 5?  \nIn ""DWELL"": D at 1? L at 5?  \nIn ""SWELL"": S at 1? L at 5?  \n\nAlso: ""JEWEL""? But J at 1? W at 2? E at 3? L at 4? What at 5? But ""JEWEL"" has E at 4? We have L at 4?  \nPosition 4 must be L?  \n\nAnother word: ""LEVEL""? But L at position 1? And position 4? But pattern: L(1) W(2) E(3) L(4) ...? But position 5?  \nPosition 5: L? Then ""LEVEL"": L,E,V,E,L? Not matching? Because position 2 must be W?  \n\nSo only possibilities:  \n- DWELT  \n- DWELL  \n- SWELL  \n- SWELT? Not word?  \n- TWELL? Not word?  \n\nSo DWELT, DWELL, SWELL?  \n\nAlso: ""CREWL""? C absent?  \n""BREWL""? B absent?  \n""YWELL""? Not word?  \n\nSo we have three candidates?  \n\nBut we can try one? For example, ""DWELT"" might be a candidate?  \n\nNow, from feedback? We don\'t know position 1 and 5?  \n\nBut we have 6 guesses? We\'ve used 3? So 3 remaining?  \n\nWe can try ""DWELT""?  \n\nIf correct? Then we win?  \nElse? Feedback will tell us.  \n\nIf we guess ""DWELT""? The feedback might reveal?  \n\nBut note: if the word is ""DWELL"", then when we guess ""DWELT"", what feedback?  \nPattern:  \nD: if correct? Position 1? Same?  \nW: ✓  \nE:✓  \nL:✓  \nT: if position 5? Secret is ""DWELL"": position 5 is L? So T vs L? So T is absent? Because L is already placed at 4? Wait? The secret: D W E L L?  \nThen our guess: D W E L T?  \nSo:  \nPosition 1: D(✓)  \nPosition 2: W(✓)  \nPosition 3: E(✓)  \nPosition 4: L(✓)  \nPosition 5: T vs L? But in secret, L is at position 5? So T is not in the word? Unless there are two T\'s? But we don\'t have T?  \nIn ""DWELT"", T is guessed? Secret ""DWELL"": has L at 5? So T? Not in the word? So T(x)?  \nSimilarly?  \n\nIf secret ""SWELL"":  \nGuess ""DWELT"":  \nPosition 1: D vs S? S absent? D absent? Both S and D may be? We don\'t know D?  \nPosition 1: D? Secret S? So D absent? Unless S==D?  \nThen D(x)  \nThen W(✓)  \nE(✓)  \nL(✓)  \nT? If secret ""SWELL"": L at position 5? T not present? So T(x)?  \n\nTherefore? If we guess ""DWELT""?  \n\nIf the secret is ""DWELT"": we\'ll get D(✓),W(✓),E(✓),L(✓),T(✓)  \nIf secret ""DWELL"": D(✓),W(✓),E(✓),L(✓),T(x) -> because T not in word?  \nIf secret ""SWELL"": D(x) -> D absent? Because S is at position 1? Then W(✓),E(✓),L(✓),T(x)?  \n\nSo by trying ""DWELT"":  \n- If we get D(✓) and T(✓)? Then win?  \n- If we get T(x) and D(✓)? Then it must be ""DWELL""?  \n- If we get D(x) and T(x)? Then it might be ""SWELL""?  \nBut position 1 D(x) means D not in word? Then secret could be ""SWELL""?  \n\nBut we have more guesses? So we can do?  \nGiven one guess? We can solve?  \n\nAlternatively? Choose a word that tests the first letter?  \n\nBut we know the pattern? So guess ""DWELT""?  \n\nWe might also note: In all candidates:  \nPosition 5 is either L or T?  \nIf position 5 is L, then word ends with L?  \n\nBut we don\'t know?  \n\nGiven efficiency? We can choose ""DWELT""?  \n\nBut there might be another word? For example, ""SWELT""? Not word?  \n\nOr ""TWELF""? Not?  \n\nSo guessed word: DWELT?  \n\nBut first? We are allowed only one guess?  \n\nLet me confirm?  \nSecret word: possibilities DWELT, DWELL, SWELL?  \n\nAlso?  \n\nAnother possibility: ""KWELL""? K W E L L?  \nUncommon? But possible?  \n\nOr ""VLEW""? Not?  \n\nBut let\'s stick to common?  \n\nGiven feedback? We can test?  \n\nAlso? We have E(✓) at position 3? L(✓) at position 4?  \nSo positions fixed?  \n\nTherefore? I choose ""DWELT""?  \n\nBut note: in whlem? M absent? So no problem?  \n\nSo let\'s guess ""DWELT""  \n\nIf wrong? Feedback will help us?  \n\nWe have only 3 guesses left? This is the fourth?  \nWe have used 3? Fourth guess?  \n\nSo no risk?  \n\nTherefore? guessed word: DWELT  \n\nReturn: <guess>dwelt</guess>  \n\nBut note: if the secret is ""DWELL""? Then it will be?  \nWe can see?  \n\nBut let\'s do it.### Step-by-Step Thought Process:\n\n1. **Analyzing Previous Feedback:**\n   - **Guess 1 (crane):** C, R, A, N are absent (x). E is present (-) but not at position 5.\n   - **Guess 2 (below):** B and O are absent (x). E is present (-) but not at position 2. L is present (-) but not at position 3. W is present (-) but not at position 5.\n   - **Guess 3 (whelm):** H and M are absent (x). E is correct at position 3 (✓). L is correct at position 4 (✓). W is present (-) but not at position 1.\n   \n2. **Key Inferences:**\n   - Positions 3 and 4 are fixed: **E** (position 3) and **L** (position 4). So the secret word pattern is: `_ _ E L _`.\n   - **W is present** and must be in position 2 (since it cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 based on feedback). Thus, the pattern is: `_ W E L _`.\n   - Ruled-out letters: **C, R, A, N, B, O, H, M** (absent in feedback).\n   - **Unknown positions:** Position 1 and 5 need to be filled with unused letters.\n   - Remaining candidate letters (not ruled out): **D, F, G, I, J, K, P, Q, S, T, U, V, X, Y, Z**.\n\n3. **Generating Possible Words:**\n   - Secret word must match `? W E L ?` and be a valid English word.\n   - Top candidates:\n     - **DWELT**: D at position 1, T at position 5.\n     - **DWELL**: D at position 1, L at position 5 (duplicate L, possible).\n     - **SWELL**: S at position 1, L at position 5 (duplicate L).\n   - Other options (less common) like KWELL or JEWEL are ruled out (K/J not tested but pattern fits).\n\n4. **Strategy for This Guess:**\n   - Focus on testing **position 5** with a letter that distinguishes between candidates (e.g., T in DWELT vs. L in DWELL/SWELL).\n   - Guess **DWELT**:\n     - If T is correct (✓), the word is DWELT.\n     - If T is absent (x), it confirms position 5 ends with L (likely DWELL or SWELL), narrowing to position 1 options (D or S).\n     - Guessing DWELT provides maximum information and resolves ambiguity efficiently.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - **DWELT** is the optimal guess—it tests position 1 (D) and position 5 (T) while fitting known constraints. This leverages existing feedback and maximizes progress toward the solution.\n\n---\n\n**Final Guess:**\n\n<guess>dwelt</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: below -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(-) L(-) O(x) W(-)\nGuess 3: whelm -> FEEDBACK: W(-) H(x) E(✓) L(✓) M(x)\nGuess 4: dwelt -> FEEDBACK: D(x) W(✓) E(✓) L(✓) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for four guesses:

**Guess 1: crane**
- Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
- Meaning: C, R, A, N are absent. E is present but not at position 5.

**Guess 2: below**
- Feedback: B(x), E(-), L(-), O(x), W(-)
- Meaning: B and O are absent. E is present but not at position 2. L is present but not at position 3. W is present but not at position 5.

**Guess 3: whelm**
- Feedback: W(-), H(x), E(✓), L(✓), M(x)
- Meaning: H and M are absent. E is correct at position 3. L is correct at position 4. W is present but not at position 1.

**Guess 4: dwelt**
- Feedback: D(x), W(✓), E(✓), L(✓), T(x)
- Meaning: D and T are absent. W, E, L are correct at positions 2, 3, 4 respectively.

### Key Conclusions:
1. **Fixed Positions:**
   - Position 3: E (from guess 3)
   - Position 4: L (from guess 3)
   - Position 2: W (from guess 4, ✓)  
   So the secret word is in the form: `_ W E L _`

2. **Absent Letters:**  
   C, R, A, N (guess 1), B, O (guess 2), H, M (guess 3), D, T (guess 4).  
   Total absent letters: **C, R, A, N, B, O, H, M, D, T**.

3. **Present Letters Confirmed:**  
   E, L, W are placed and confirmed at positions 3, 4, 2 respectively.  
   No other letters are confirmed present yet? Since we have positions 1 and 5 to fill? And we know no other letters?  
   From feedback? We don't have evidence of additional letters?  

   However, note:  
   - Secret word has 5 letters? Positions 1 and 5 are unknown?  
   - We must fill them? But we haven't found the missing letters?  
   - But E, L, W are accounted for? So positions 1 and 5 must be distinct letters?  

4. **Remaining Letters to Consider:**  
   Excluding absent letters, remaining letters are: F, G, I, J, K, P, Q, S, U, V, X, Y, Z?  
   Common letters among these: S, F, G, K, P, U? (high-frequency?).

5. **Pattern:**  
   The word follows the pattern: `? W E L ?`  
   Position 1: One new letter.  
   Position 5: Another new letter.  

   Therefore, we need a 5-letter English word of the form `X W E L Y`, where:  
   - X and Y are not in the absent list?  
   - And X and Y are letters from the remaining pool?  

### Possible Words:
Given our word pattern `? W E L ?`, we need to list possible English words?  
Examples:  
- **SWELL**: S(1), W(2), E(3), L(4), L(5)? But duplicated L? Plausible?  
- **DWELL**: Not? D and T absent? Eliminated?  
- Other words:  
  - **SWELL** (S, W, E, L, L)  
    - **But note**: Position 5: L? Duplicated L? But position 4 is L? So two L's?  
    - Or **SPELL**: P? But not? Pattern? P?  
    - ""SWE?L"": ""SWEAL""? Not common?  
    - **KNELL**: K N? N absent?  
    - **FJELL**: F J E L L? Valid word?  
    - **SMELT**: S M? M absent?  
    - **SMELL**: S M? M absent?  

But our absent letters include M?  

Common possibilities:  
- **SWELL**: S W E L L? Duplicated L?  
- **TWILL**? T W I L L? But T absent? Cannot?  
- **QUILL**? Q U I L L? Pattern? Not matching?  
- **YWELL**? Not word?  

### Candidates?  
We must use letters:  
Position 1: S, F, G, K, P, U?  

List:  
- **SWELL**: S at 1? L at 5?  
- **FWELL**? Not word?  
- **GWELL**? Not?  
- **SPELL**: S P E L L? But pattern: S(1), P(2)? Position 2 should be W? Must be W? Not!  

Hence? The word must have W at position 2? So pattern `_ W E L _`?  

Therefore? Words:  
- `?WELL`: Words that end with ""WELL""?  
  - SWELL? Valid?  
  - DWELL? Invalid? D absent?  
  - But SWELL? S W E L L? Position 1 S? Position 5 L?  
  - Also: ""WELL"" related?  

But position 5: can be something else? Not Well?  

Other words?  
- **DWELT**? Already guessed? Absent?  
- **TWELV**? Not?  
- **JEWEL**: J at 1? W at 2? E at 3? L at 4? And position 5? E? Or? No? ""JEWEL"" is J,E,W,E,L? So positions:  
  J(1), E(2), W(3)? E(4)? L(5)? But pattern requires W at position 2? And E at 3?  
  Position 2: E? Conflict?  
- **LEVEL**: L(1), E(2), V(3), E(4), L(5)? Position 2: E? Should be W? Conflict?  
- **REVEL**: R absent?  
- **BEVEL**: B absent?  

So SWELL? Seems plausible?  

What about **S W E L S**? Not word?  

Therefore? We must have position 5 L? Or other possibilities?  

Another common word: **QUELL**: Q U E L L? Pattern: Q(1), U(2), E(3), L(4), L(5)? Position 2: U? Should be W? Not matching?  

Hence? SWELL? Appears as possible?  

But is there other? **KVELL**: K V E L L? Meaning? To boast?  

Pattern: K(1), V(2)? Position 2 V? Should be W? Not matching?  

Therefore? The only reasonable common word ending the pattern is **SWELL**? It has:  
S(1), W(2), E(3), L(4), L(5)?  
Position 5 L duplicates position 4 L? But we have L already?  

We know L is at position 4? We don't know if duplicated?  

But feedback from below: L was marked as present? At position 3? But no duplication?  

Now? Position 5 could be L? Secret word ""SWELL""?  

But from guess 3: L at position 4? Correct?  

Then? Position 5 L? Possible?  

How differentiate?  

But our pattern: `_ W E L _`?  
We guessed ""dwelt"": positions 1 D? Absent? Position 5 T? Absent?  

So? In ""SWELL"":  
Position 1 S? New letter? Position 5 L? Duplication?  

We haven't tested S?  

So? We can test ""SWELL"" as guess?  

But note: if we guess ""SWELL"":  
- Position 1: S? Possibly?  
- Position 5: L? Previously?  

But in ""dwelt""? Position 5: T? Absent? Because secret has L at position 5? Or what?  

But ""SWELL"" has both positions?  

If we guess ""SWELL""? Then if correct? Win?  
Else? Feedback?  

Given other candidats? I think SWELL is the only common word?  

But let's confirm?  
Letters forbidden: C,R,A,N,B,O,H,M,D,T?  
Available letters for position 1: F, G, I, J, K, P, Q, S, U, V, X, Y, Z?  

Words?  
- SWELL: S at 1?  
- SPELL: S(1), P(2)? Position 2 not W? Conflict?  
- SMELL: M absent?  
- SKULL: S K U L L? Position: S(1), K(2), U(3), L(4), L(5)? Position 2: K? Not W?  
- SHALL: H absent?  
- STILL: T absent?  

So SWELL?  

Perhaps **GREWL**? Not word?  

Therefore? Guessed word: SWELL?  

But let's see?  

But we have position 5: must be a letter? And in SWELL, it is L?  

But L is already used? So we can have duplicate L?  

Yes? Since feedback didn't show anything?  

But in guess 2: ""below"": L at position 3? Feedback (-) meaning present elsewhere? And position 5? We had W?  

No indication? So SWELL is valid?  

Then? Guess ""SWELL""?  

But we have only 5 guesses? And we?  

Let's do!  

Actually? We have guessed: crane, below, whelm, dwelt?  
Fourth guess?  
Fifth?  

So we have two guesses? Possibly? But we risk?  

But there might be another word: **FLUES**? But F L U E S? Position 2 L? Not W?  

So?  

**Final decision**: Guess ""SWELL""?  
If correct? Solved?  
Else? It'd be?  

But also? Position 1: S? If absent? Then we don't know?  

But SWELL?  
So <guess>swell</guess>  

But let's check:  
- Secret: positions 1? S? New?  
- Position 5: L? Duplicated?  

Yes.  

So guessed word: SWELL
</think>
### Analysis of Previous Feedback
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: Confirmed **E** is present but not at position 5. Ruled out **C, R, A, N**.
- **Guess 2 (below)**: Confirmed **E** not at position 2, **L** not at position 3, **W** not at position 5. Ruled out **B, O**.
- **Guess 3 (whelm)**: Confirmed **E** at position 3 (✓), **L** at position 4 (✓), **W** not at position 1. Ruled out **H, M**.
- **Guess 4 (dwelt)**: Confirmed **W** at position 2 (✓), **E** at position 3 (✓), **L** at position 4 (✓). Ruled out **D, T**.

### Key Inferences
1. **Fixed pattern**: `_ W E L _` (positions 2, 3, 4 confirmed as **W**, **E**, **L**).
2. **Absent letters (18 total)**: C, R, A, N, B, O, H, M, D, T (eliminated via feedback).
3. **Focus**: Position 1 and 5 must be filled with letters from the remaining pool: **F, G, I, J, K, P, Q, S, U, V, X, Y, Z**.
4. **Constraints**:
   - Position 1: Cannot reuse ruled-out letters; must form a valid English word.
   - Position 5: Likely **L** (duplicate) or a new consonant/vowel, given common words.
5. **Probable words**: ""SWELL"" (most common match for `_ W E L L` pattern) or less common variants like ""KWELL"" or ""YWELL"".

### Strategy
- **Prioritize ""SWELL""**: Tests:
  - **S** at position 1 (common starter).
  - **L** at position 5 (possible duplication for efficiency).
- **Why it works**: If ""SWELL"" is correct (✓), it solves the puzzle. If not, feedback on **S** (position 1) or **L** (position 5) will reduce possibilities to rare words.

<guess>swell</guess>",swell,"We are given feedback for four guesses:

**Guess 1: crane**
- Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
- Meaning: C, R, A, N are absent. E is present but not at position 5.

**Guess 2: below**
- Feedback: B(x), E(-), L(-), O(x), W(-)
- Meaning: B and O are absent. E is present but not at position 2. L is present but not at position 3. W is present but not at position 5.

**Guess 3: whelm**
- Feedback: W(-), H(x), E(✓), L(✓), M(x)
- Meaning: H and M are absent. E is correct at position 3. L is correct at position 4. W is present but not at position 1.

**Guess 4: dwelt**
- Feedback: D(x), W(✓), E(✓), L(✓), T(x)
- Meaning: D and T are absent. W, E, L are correct at positions 2, 3, 4 respectively.

### Key Conclusions:
1. **Fixed Positions:**
   - Position 3: E (from guess 3)
   - Position 4: L (from guess 3)
   - Position 2: W (from guess 4, ✓)  
   So the secret word is in the form: `_ W E L _`

2. **Absent Letters:**  
   C, R, A, N (guess 1), B, O (guess 2), H, M (guess 3), D, T (guess 4).  
   Total absent letters: **C, R, A, N, B, O, H, M, D, T**.

3. **Present Letters Confirmed:**  
   E, L, W are placed and confirmed at positions 3, 4, 2 respectively.  
   No other letters are confirmed present yet? Since we have positions 1 and 5 to fill? And we know no other letters?  
   From feedback? We don't have evidence of additional letters?  

   However, note:  
   - Secret word has 5 letters? Positions 1 and 5 are unknown?  
   - We must fill them? But we haven't found the missing letters?  
   - But E, L, W are accounted for? So positions 1 and 5 must be distinct letters?  

4. **Remaining Letters to Consider:**  
   Excluding absent letters, remaining letters are: F, G, I, J, K, P, Q, S, U, V, X, Y, Z?  
   Common letters among these: S, F, G, K, P, U? (high-frequency?).

5. **Pattern:**  
   The word follows the pattern: `? W E L ?`  
   Position 1: One new letter.  
   Position 5: Another new letter.  

   Therefore, we need a 5-letter English word of the form `X W E L Y`, where:  
   - X and Y are not in the absent list?  
   - And X and Y are letters from the remaining pool?  

### Possible Words:
Given our word pattern `? W E L ?`, we need to list possible English words?  
Examples:  
- **SWELL**: S(1), W(2), E(3), L(4), L(5)? But duplicated L? Plausible?  
- **DWELL**: Not? D and T absent? Eliminated?  
- Other words:  
  - **SWELL** (S, W, E, L, L)  
    - **But note**: Position 5: L? Duplicated L? But position 4 is L? So two L's?  
    - Or **SPELL**: P? But not? Pattern? P?  
    - ""SWE?L"": ""SWEAL""? Not common?  
    - **KNELL**: K N? N absent?  
    - **FJELL**: F J E L L? Valid word?  
    - **SMELT**: S M? M absent?  
    - **SMELL**: S M? M absent?  

But our absent letters include M?  

Common possibilities:  
- **SWELL**: S W E L L? Duplicated L?  
- **TWILL**? T W I L L? But T absent? Cannot?  
- **QUILL**? Q U I L L? Pattern? Not matching?  
- **YWELL**? Not word?  

### Candidates?  
We must use letters:  
Position 1: S, F, G, K, P, U?  

List:  
- **SWELL**: S at 1? L at 5?  
- **FWELL**? Not word?  
- **GWELL**? Not?  
- **SPELL**: S P E L L? But pattern: S(1), P(2)? Position 2 should be W? Must be W? Not!  

Hence? The word must have W at position 2? So pattern `_ W E L _`?  

Therefore? Words:  
- `?WELL`: Words that end with ""WELL""?  
  - SWELL? Valid?  
  - DWELL? Invalid? D absent?  
  - But SWELL? S W E L L? Position 1 S? Position 5 L?  
  - Also: ""WELL"" related?  

But position 5: can be something else? Not Well?  

Other words?  
- **DWELT**? Already guessed? Absent?  
- **TWELV**? Not?  
- **JEWEL**: J at 1? W at 2? E at 3? L at 4? And position 5? E? Or? No? ""JEWEL"" is J,E,W,E,L? So positions:  
  J(1), E(2), W(3)? E(4)? L(5)? But pattern requires W at position 2? And E at 3?  
  Position 2: E? Conflict?  
- **LEVEL**: L(1), E(2), V(3), E(4), L(5)? Position 2: E? Should be W? Conflict?  
- **REVEL**: R absent?  
- **BEVEL**: B absent?  

So SWELL? Seems plausible?  

What about **S W E L S**? Not word?  

Therefore? We must have position 5 L? Or other possibilities?  

Another common word: **QUELL**: Q U E L L? Pattern: Q(1), U(2), E(3), L(4), L(5)? Position 2: U? Should be W? Not matching?  

Hence? SWELL? Appears as possible?  

But is there other? **KVELL**: K V E L L? Meaning? To boast?  

Pattern: K(1), V(2)? Position 2 V? Should be W? Not matching?  

Therefore? The only reasonable common word ending the pattern is **SWELL**? It has:  
S(1), W(2), E(3), L(4), L(5)?  
Position 5 L duplicates position 4 L? But we have L already?  

We know L is at position 4? We don't know if duplicated?  

But feedback from below: L was marked as present? At position 3? But no duplication?  

Now? Position 5 could be L? Secret word ""SWELL""?  

But from guess 3: L at position 4? Correct?  

Then? Position 5 L? Possible?  

How differentiate?  

But our pattern: `_ W E L _`?  
We guessed ""dwelt"": positions 1 D? Absent? Position 5 T? Absent?  

So? In ""SWELL"":  
Position 1 S? New letter? Position 5 L? Duplication?
