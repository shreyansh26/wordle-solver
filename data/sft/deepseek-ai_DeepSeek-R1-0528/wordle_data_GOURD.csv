We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", etc. Let's choose one that has a good mix of common vowels and consonants.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N). Also, it doesn't repeat any letters.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
C: x (not in the word)
R: - (in the word but wrong position)
A: x (not in the word)
N: x (not in the word)
E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since we placed it in the second position and got a '-' meaning it's present but misplaced).
- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter R, and it is not in the second position. Also, it does not contain C, A, N, or E.

We have 5 remaining guesses.

For the next guess, we should choose a word that:
- Includes the letter R (since we know it's in the word) and places it in a different position than the second one (to try to locate its correct spot).
- Avoids the letters C, A, N, E (since they are not in the word).
- Includes other common letters to maximize the chance of getting more information.

Common letters in 5-letter words (besides the ones we've eliminated) might include: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

We know R is in the word, so let's try to put R in a different position. In the first guess, R was in position 2. Now we can try positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

We also want to avoid repeating the same letters we know are absent (C, A, N, E).

Let's think of words that have R and avoid C, A, N, E.

Some possibilities:
- Words with R in the first position: e.g., ""ROAST"" (but A is absent, so we cannot use A) -> not allowed because A is absent.
- We must avoid A, so we need words without A, C, N, E.

That limits our choices.

Let me try to list some words that have R and without C, A, N, E.

Common letters to try: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, H, etc.

Example words:
- ""SPRIG"": S, P, R, I, G -> but we don't know about these letters. However, we have to avoid A, C, N, E, which it does.
- ""THROW"": T, H, R, O, W -> avoids A, C, N, E. But note: we have R and we can put it in a different position. In ""crane"", R was in position 2. In ""THROW"", R is in position 3. Also, we get to test T, H, O, W.

Another option: ""PROUD"" (P, R, O, U, D) -> R in position 2? Actually, in ""PROUD"", R is in position 2. But we already know R is not in position 2? Wait, no: the feedback for ""crane"" said R is in the word but not in position 2. So we can try R in position 2 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not there. The feedback already told us that R is not in position 2, so we should avoid putting R in position 2 again.

Therefore, in the next guess, we should put R in a position other than 2.

So for ""THROW"": positions: T(1), H(2), R(3), O(4), W(5). R is in position 3 -> good.

Similarly, ""SPRIG"": S(1), P(2), R(3), I(4), G(5). R in position 3.

Another word: ""ROBOT"" -> but R in position 1, but it has O and B and T. However, we have to avoid A, C, N, E. ""ROBOT"" avoids these. But note: we have two O's? Actually, ""ROBOT"" has two O's? R-O-B-O-T -> two O's? Actually, no: R, O, B, O, T -> two O's. That might not be ideal because we are trying to get more information, and repeating a letter might reduce the information. But if the word has duplicate letters, that's okay if the secret word has duplicates, but we don't know. So it's better to use distinct letters to maximize information.

Therefore, ""THROW"" and ""SPRIG"" have distinct letters.

Another word: ""DRUID"" -> D, R, U, I, D -> has two D's? Not distinct. Also, D is in position 1 and 5? So not ideal.

""PRISM"": P, R, I, S, M -> distinct and avoids A, C, N, E. R is in position 2? Wait: P(1), R(2), I(3), S(4), M(5). But we know R is not in position 2? Actually, we know that in the secret word, R is not in position 2. But we can still put R in position 2 in our guess? It would be inefficient because we already know that position 2 is not R. So we should avoid putting R in position 2.

Therefore, we want a word that has R in a position other than 2 and avoids A, C, N, E.

So ""PRISM"" has R in position 2 -> not good.

""THROW"": R in position 3 -> good.
""SPRIG"": R in position 3 -> good.

Another one: ""ROWDY"": R(1), O(2), W(3), D(4), Y(5) -> avoids A, C, N, E. R is in position 1 -> good.

But ""ROWDY"" has O in position 2. We don't know about O.

Alternatively, ""ROTLS"" is not a word. 

""ROILS"": R(1), O(2), I(3), L(4), S(5) -> valid? Yes, ""roils"". Avoids A, C, N, E.

But we have to consider that we are also testing other common letters.

I think ""THROW"" is a good candidate because it has T, H, R, O, W. T and H are common.

Similarly, ""SPRIG"" has S, P, R, I, G. S and I are common.

Another candidate: ""BRUSH"" -> B, R, U, S, H. But we don't know about B, U, S, H. And R is in position 2? B(1), R(2) -> again, position 2 for R, which we want to avoid.

So we must avoid position 2 for R.

Let me list words with R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Position 1: 
- Words starting with R: e.g., ""ROBOT"" (but two O's), ""ROWDY"", ""ROILS"", ""RUSTS"" (two S's), ""RUMPS"", ""RUMPS"" is not common? ""RUMPS"" is a word? Actually, ""rump"" is singular, but ""rumps"" is plural. But let's stick to common words.

Position 3:
- Words with R in third position: ""THROW"", ""SPRIG"", ""SHIRT"" (but H, I, R, T -> and avoids A, C, N, E? ""SHIRT"": S, H, I, R, T -> yes, avoids A, C, N, E). Also, R is in position 4? Let's see: S(1), H(2), I(3), R(4), T(5). So R is in position 4? Actually, in ""SHIRT"", the positions are:
  S:1, H:2, I:3, R:4, T:5 -> so R is in position 4.

Wait, I think I miscounted. In ""SHIRT"":
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: H
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: R
- Position 5: T

So R is in position 4.

Similarly, ""SPRIG"": 
- S:1, P:2, R:3, I:4, G:5 -> R in position 3.

""THROW"":
- T:1, H:2, R:3, O:4, W:5 -> R in position 3.

Position 5: 
- Words ending with R: e.g., ""RUMOR"" (but two R's and two O's? R,U,M,O,R -> two R's and two O's) -> not distinct. ""TUMOR"" (T,U,M,O,R) -> distinct? T,U,M,O,R -> distinct. And avoids A, C, N, E. So ""TUMOR"" has R in position 5.

But we don't know if T, U, M, O are in the word.

Now, we have to choose one. We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let's compare:

Option 1: ""THROW"" - tests T, H, R, O, W. R is in position 3 (which is new, not position 2). We avoid A, C, N, E.

Option 2: ""SPRIG"" - tests S, P, R, I, G. R in position 3.

Option 3: ""SHIRT"" - tests S, H, I, R, T. R in position 4.

Option 4: ""ROWDY"" - tests R, O, W, D, Y. R in position 1.

Option 5: ""TUMOR"" - tests T, U, M, O, R. R in position 5.

We know R is in the word, so we are guaranteed to get at least one hit on R. The other letters are new.

We want to maximize the chance of getting more correct positions or at least more present letters.

Since we have no other information, any of these are fine. But note that we have 5 letters to test and we want to cover common letters.

Common letters in 5-letter words (excluding A, E, I, O, U? But we haven't tested all vowels. We know A and E are absent, but O and I and U are still possible).

We have eliminated A and E (vowels) and C, N (consonants). So the vowels that might be present: I, O, U.

Consonants: we have R, and others.

In the remaining, the most common letters are: S, T, L, O, I, etc.

So ""THROW"" has T, H, O, W and R (which we know is present). H and W are less common.

""SPRIG"" has S, P, I, G. S and I are common.

""SHIRT"" has S, H, I, T. S, T, I are common.

""ROWDY"" has O, W, D, Y. O is common, but W, D, Y are less common.

""TUMOR"" has T, U, M, O. T and O are common.

So ""SHIRT"" and ""THROW"" and ""SPRIG"" are good.

But note: in ""SHIRT"", we are testing S, H, I, R, T. And R is in position 4.

In ""THROW"", we are testing T, H, R, O, W. R in position 3.

In ""SPRIG"", we are testing S, P, R, I, G. R in position 3.

I think ""SHIRT"" is a good choice because it has S, T, I which are very common, and H is also common. Also, it tests R in a new position (4).

Alternatively, we could choose a word that has R and also other common letters, and avoid the absent ones.

Another word: ""TRIOS"" -> T, R, I, O, S -> but R is in position 2? T(1), R(2), I(3), O(4), S(5). We want to avoid position 2 for R. So not good.

""STORM"": S, T, O, R, M -> R in position 4? S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), M(5). So R in position 4. And avoids A, C, N, E. This tests S, T, O, R, M. O is a vowel we haven't tested. This is also a good candidate.

But we already have ""SHIRT"" and ""STORM"".

I think I'll go with ""SHIRT"" because it has more common letters: S, T, I, R, H.

But let's check: in ""SHIRT"", we have I and T and S, which are common.

Alternatively, ""STORM"" has S, T, O, R, M. O is a vowel we haven't tested.

But we know that A and E are absent, so the vowel must be I, O, or U. Testing O might be good.

But we can also test I.

Since we have limited guesses, we want to cover as many common letters as possible.

The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... but we know A, E, N are absent. So T, O, I, S are the next.

So a word that includes T, O, I, S would be ideal, but we also have to include R and avoid A, C, N, E.

Is there a word that has T, O, I, S and R? But we have 5 positions. For example, ""TROIS"" (which is a word, meaning plural of trois, but it's French and might not be in the word list? In Wordle, it might be accepted, but let's stick to common English words). ""ROIST"" is not a word.

""RIOTS"": R, I, O, T, S -> but R is in position 1? And avoids A, C, N, E. ""RIOTS"" is a valid word. R(1), I(2), O(3), T(4), S(5). But we are putting R in position 1, which is fine (not position 2). This word tests R, I, O, T, S. That's five very common letters (except R we already know is present). This is excellent because we test I, O, T, S, all common, and R.

But note: we are putting I in position 2 and O in position 3, etc. We don't know the positions, but we are covering many common letters.

Is ""RIOTS"" a valid word? Yes, meaning a violent disturbance.

So I think ""RIOTS"" is a very good choice.

Alternatively, if we are concerned about the position of R, we know R is not in position 2, but we are putting it in position 1, which is a new position.

So let's choose ""RIOTS"".

But wait, in ""RIOTS"", we have R in position 1. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing it.

We can also consider ""ROTIS"" (a type of bread) but that might be less common.

I think ""RIOTS"" is acceptable.

But let me confirm: we are avoiding A, C, N, E? Yes.

So the word is ""RIOTS"".

Alternatively, if we want to avoid repeating the same structure, but I think it's fine.

Another word: ""SIRUP"" (variant of syrup) but it has U and P, and we might not want to use U if we can avoid it? But it's okay.

But ""RIOTS"" seems better.

So I'll go with ""RIOTS"".

But note: we have to make sure that the word is in the word list. Since the game uses valid English words, and ""riots"" is common, it should be.

Therefore, the next guess is ""RIOTS"".

But let's double-check the feedback we have: we know R is in the word, but not in position 2. In ""RIOTS"", R is in position 1, which is a new position. We are testing I in position 2, O in position 3, T in position 4, S in position 5.

This should give us good information.

So the guess is ""RIOTS"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- R is in the secret word but not in the second position (marked with ""-"").

For the next guess:
- The word must include R (since it is confirmed to be in the secret word) and avoid C, A, N, E (since they are absent).
- R should be placed in a position other than the second one to test new locations (e.g., position 1, 3, 4, or 5).
- To maximize information, the guess should use common letters not yet tested (like S, T, I, O) and avoid repeating known absent letters.

The word ""riots"" meets these criteria:
- It contains R (in position 1, a new position to test).
- It avoids C, A, N, E.
- It introduces new common letters: S, T, I, O.
- All letters are distinct, which helps gather more information about the secret word.

<guess>riots</guess>",riots,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
C: x (not in the word)
R: - (in the word but wrong position)
A: x (not in the word)
N: x (not in the word)
E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since we placed it in the second position and got a '-' meaning it's present but misplaced).
- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter R, and it is not in the second position. Also, it does not contain C, A, N, or E.

We have 5 remaining guesses.

For the next guess, we should choose a word that:
- Includes the letter R (since we know it's in the word) and places it in a different position than the second one (to try to locate its correct spot).
- Avoids the letters C, A, N, E (since they are not in the word).
- Includes other common letters to maximize the chance of getting more information.

Common letters in 5-letter words (besides the ones we've eliminated) might include: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

We know R is in the word, so let's try to put R in a different position. In the first guess, R was in position 2. Now we can try positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

We also want to avoid repeating the same letters we know are absent (C, A, N, E).

Let's think of words that have R and avoid C, A, N, E.

Some possibilities:
- Words with R in the first position: e.g., ""ROAST"" (but A is absent, so we cannot use A) -> not allowed because A is absent.
- We must avoid A, so we need words without A, C, N, E.

That limits our choices.

Let me try to list some words that have R and without C, A, N, E.

Common letters to try: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, H, etc.

Example words:
- ""SPRIG"": S, P, R, I, G -> but we don't know about these letters. However, we have to avoid A, C, N, E, which it does.
- ""THROW"": T, H, R, O, W -> avoids A, C, N, E. But note: we have R and we can put it in a different position. In ""crane"", R was in position 2. In ""THROW"", R is in position 3. Also, we get to test T, H, O, W.

Another option: ""PROUD"" (P, R, O, U, D) -> R in position 2? Actually, in ""PROUD"", R is in position 2. But we already know R is not in position 2? Wait, no: the feedback for ""crane"" said R is in the word but not in position 2. So we can try R in position 2 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not there. The feedback already told us that R is not in position 2, so we should avoid putting R in position 2 again.

Therefore, in the next guess, we should put R in a position other than 2.

So for ""THROW"": positions: T(1), H(2), R(3), O(4), W(5). R is in position 3 -> good.

Similarly, ""SPRIG"": S(1), P(2), R(3), I(4), G(5). R in position 3.

Another word: ""ROBOT"" -> but R in position 1, but it has O and B and T. However, we have to avoid A, C, N, E. ""ROBOT"" avoids these. But note: we have two O's? Actually, ""ROBOT"" has two O's? R-O-B-O-T -> two O's? Actually, no: R, O, B, O, T -> two O's. That might not be ideal because we are trying to get more information, and repeating a letter might reduce the information. But if the word has duplicate letters, that's okay if the secret word has duplicates, but we don't know. So it's better to use distinct letters to maximize information.

Therefore, ""THROW"" and ""SPRIG"" have distinct letters.

Another word: ""DRUID"" -> D, R, U, I, D -> has two D's? Not distinct. Also, D is in position 1 and 5? So not ideal.

""PRISM"": P, R, I, S, M -> distinct and avoids A, C, N, E. R is in position 2? Wait: P(1), R(2), I(3), S(4), M(5). But we know R is not in position 2? Actually, we know that in the secret word, R is not in position 2. But we can still put R in position 2 in our guess? It would be inefficient because we already know that position 2 is not R. So we should avoid putting R in position 2.

Therefore, we want a word that has R in a position other than 2 and avoids A, C, N, E.

So ""PRISM"" has R in position 2 -> not good.

""THROW"": R in position 3 -> good.
""SPRIG"": R in position 3 -> good.

Another one: ""ROWDY"": R(1), O(2), W(3), D(4), Y(5) -> avoids A, C, N, E. R is in position 1 -> good.

But ""ROWDY"" has O in position 2. We don't know about O.

Alternatively, ""ROTLS"" is not a word. 

""ROILS"": R(1), O(2), I(3), L(4), S(5) -> valid? Yes, ""roils"". Avoids A, C, N, E.

But we have to consider that we are also testing other common letters.

I think ""THROW"" is a good candidate because it has T, H, R, O, W. T and H are common.

Similarly, ""SPRIG"" has S, P, R, I, G. S and I are common.

Another candidate: ""BRUSH"" -> B, R, U, S, H. But we don't know about B, U, S, H. And R is in position 2? B(1), R(2) -> again, position 2 for R, which we want to avoid.

So we must avoid position 2 for R.

Let me list words with R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Position 1: 
- Words starting with R: e.g., ""ROBOT"" (but two O's), ""ROWDY"", ""ROILS"", ""RUSTS"" (two S's), ""RUMPS"", ""RUMPS"" is not common? ""RUMPS"" is a word? Actually, ""rump"" is singular, but ""rumps"" is plural. But let's stick to common words.

Position 3:
- Words with R in third position: ""THROW"", ""SPRIG"", ""SHIRT"" (but H, I, R, T -> and avoids A, C, N, E? ""SHIRT"": S, H, I, R, T -> yes, avoids A, C, N, E). Also, R is in position 4? Let's see: S(1), H(2), I(3), R(4), T(5). So R is in position 4? Actually, in ""SHIRT"", the positions are:
  S:1, H:2, I:3, R:4, T:5 -> so R is in position 4.

Wait, I think I miscounted. In ""SHIRT"":
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: H
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: R
- Position 5: T

So R is in position 4.

Similarly, ""SPRIG"": 
- S:1, P:2, R:3, I:4, G:5 -> R in position 3.

""THROW"":
- T:1, H:2, R:3, O:4, W:5 -> R in position 3.

Position 5: 
- Words ending with R: e.g., ""RUMOR"" (but two R's and two O's? R,U,M,O,R -> two R's and two O's) -> not distinct. ""TUMOR"" (T,U,M,O,R) -> distinct? T,U,M,O,R -> distinct. And avoids A, C, N, E. So ""TUMOR"" has R in position 5.

But we don't know if T, U, M, O are in the word.

Now, we have to choose one. We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let's compare:

Option 1: ""THROW"" - tests T, H, R, O, W. R is in position 3 (which is new, not position 2). We avoid A, C, N, E.

Option 2: ""SPRIG"" - tests S, P, R, I, G. R in position 3.

Option 3: ""SHIRT"" - tests S, H, I, R, T. R in position 4.

Option 4: ""ROWDY"" - tests R, O, W, D, Y. R in position 1.

Option 5: ""TUMOR"" - tests T, U, M, O, R. R in position 5.

We know R is in the word, so we are guaranteed to get at least one hit on R. The other letters are new.

We want to maximize the chance of getting more correct positions or at least more present letters.

Since we have no other information, any of these are fine. But note that we have 5 letters to test and we want to cover common letters.

Common letters in 5-letter words (excluding A, E, I, O, U? But we haven't tested all vowels. We know A and E are absent, but O and I and U are still possible).

We have eliminated A and E (vowels) and C, N (consonants). So the vowels that might be present: I, O, U.

Consonants: we have R, and others.

In the remaining, the most common letters are: S, T, L, O, I, etc.

So ""THROW"" has T, H, O, W and R (which we know is present). H and W are less common.

""SPRIG"" has S, P, I, G. S and I are common.

""SHIRT"" has S, H, I, T. S, T, I are common.

""ROWDY"" has O, W, D, Y. O is common, but W, D, Y are less common.

""TUMOR"" has T, U, M, O. T and O are common.

So ""SHIRT"" and ""THROW"" and ""SPRIG"" are good.

But note: in ""SHIRT"", we are testing S, H, I, R, T. And R is in position 4.

In ""THROW"", we are testing T, H, R, O, W. R in position 3.

In ""SPRIG"", we are testing S, P, R, I, G. R in position 3.

I think ""SHIRT"" is a good choice because it has S, T, I which are very common, and H is also common. Also, it tests R in a new position (4).

Alternatively, we could choose a word that has R and also other common letters, and avoid the absent ones.

Another word: ""TRIOS"" -> T, R, I, O, S -> but R is in position 2? T(1), R(2), I(3), O(4), S(5). We want to avoid position 2 for R. So not good.

""STORM"": S, T, O, R, M -> R in position 4? S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), M(5). So R in position 4. And avoids A, C, N, E. This tests S, T, O, R, M. O is a vowel we haven't tested. This is also a good candidate.

But we already have ""SHIRT"" and ""STORM"".

I think I'll go with ""SHIRT"" because it has more common letters: S, T, I, R, H.

But let's check: in ""SHIRT"", we have I and T and S, which are common.

Alternatively, ""STORM"" has S, T, O, R, M. O is a vowel we haven't tested.

But we know that A and E are absent, so the vowel must be I, O, or U. Testing O might be good.

But we can also test I.

Since we have limited guesses, we want to cover as many common letters as possible.

The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... but we know A, E, N are absent. So T, O, I, S are the next.

So a word that includes T, O, I, S would be ideal, but we also have to include R and avoid A, C, N, E.

Is there a word that has T, O, I, S and R? But we have 5 positions. For example, ""TROIS"" (which is a word, meaning plural of trois, but it's French and might not be in the word list? In Wordle, it might be accepted, but let's stick to common English words). ""ROIST"" is not a word.

""RIOTS"": R, I, O, T, S -> but R is in position 1? And avoids A, C, N, E. ""RIOTS"" is a valid word. R(1), I(2), O(3), T(4), S(5). But we are putting R in position 1, which is fine (not position 2). This word tests R, I, O, T, S. That's five very common letters (except R we already know is present). This is excellent because we test I, O, T, S, all common, and R.

But note: we are putting I in position 2 and O in position 3, etc. We don't know the positions, but we are covering many common letters.

Is ""RIOTS"" a valid word? Yes, meaning a violent disturbance.

So I think ""RIOTS"" is a very good choice.

Alternatively, if we are concerned about the position of R, we know R is not in position 2, but we are putting it in position 1, which is a new position.

So let's choose ""RIOTS"".

But wait, in ""RIOTS"", we have R in position 1. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing it.

We can also consider ""ROTIS"" (a type of bread) but that might be less common.

I think ""RIOTS"" is acceptable.

But let me confirm: we are avoiding A, C, N, E? Yes.

So the word is ""RIOTS"".

Alternatively, if we want to avoid repeating the same structure, but I think it's fine.

Another word: ""SIRUP"" (variant of syrup) but it has U and P, and we might not want to use U if we can avoid it? But it's okay.

But ""RIOTS"" seems better.

So I'll go with ""RIOTS"".

But note: we have to make sure that the word is in the word list. Since the game uses valid English words, and ""riots"" is common, it should be.

Therefore, the next guess is ""RIOTS"".

But let's double-check the feedback we have: we know R is in the word, but not in position 2. In ""RIOTS"", R is in position 1, which is a new position. We are testing I in position 2, O in position 3, T in position 4, S in position 5.

This should give us good information.

So the guess is ""RIOTS"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- R is in the secret word but not in the second position (marked with ""-"").

For the next guess:
- The word must include R (since it is confirmed to be in the secret word) and avoid C, A, N, E (since they are absent).
- R should be placed in a position other than the second one to test new locations (e.g., position 1, 3, 4, or 5).
- To maximize information, the guess should use common letters not yet tested (like S, T, I, O) and avoid repeating known absent letters.

The word ""riots"" meets these criteria:
- It contains R (in position 1, a new position to test).
- It avoids C, A, N, E.
- It introduces new common letters: S, T, I, O.
- All letters are distinct, which helps gather more information about the secret word.",Guess 2: riots -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) O(-) T(x) S(x),FAIL

 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", etc. Let's choose one that has a good mix of common vowels and consonants.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N). Also, it doesn't repeat any letters.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
C: x (not in the word)
R: - (in the word but wrong position)
A: x (not in the word)
N: x (not in the word)
E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since we placed it in the second position and got a '-' meaning it's present but misplaced).
- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter R, and it is not in the second position. Also, it does not contain C, A, N, or E.

We have 5 remaining guesses.

For the next guess, we should choose a word that:
- Includes the letter R (since we know it's in the word) and places it in a different position than the second one (to try to locate its correct spot).
- Avoids the letters C, A, N, E (since they are not in the word).
- Includes other common letters to maximize the chance of getting more information.

Common letters in 5-letter words (besides the ones we've eliminated) might include: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

We know R is in the word, so let's try to put R in a different position. In the first guess, R was in position 2. Now we can try positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

We also want to avoid repeating the same letters we know are absent (C, A, N, E).

Let's think of words that have R and avoid C, A, N, E.

Some possibilities:
- Words with R in the first position: e.g., ""ROAST"" (but A is absent, so we cannot use A) -> not allowed because A is absent.
- We must avoid A, so we need words without A, C, N, E.

That limits our choices.

Let me try to list some words that have R and without C, A, N, E.

Common letters to try: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, H, etc.

Example words:
- ""SPRIG"": S, P, R, I, G -> but we don't know about these letters. However, we have to avoid A, C, N, E, which it does.
- ""THROW"": T, H, R, O, W -> avoids A, C, N, E. But note: we have R and we can put it in a different position. In ""crane"", R was in position 2. In ""THROW"", R is in position 3. Also, we get to test T, H, O, W.

Another option: ""PROUD"" (P, R, O, U, D) -> R in position 2? Actually, in ""PROUD"", R is in position 2. But we already know R is not in position 2? Wait, no: the feedback for ""crane"" said R is in the word but not in position 2. So we can try R in position 2 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not there. The feedback already told us that R is not in position 2, so we should avoid putting R in position 2 again.

Therefore, in the next guess, we should put R in a position other than 2.

So for ""THROW"": positions: T(1), H(2), R(3), O(4), W(5). R is in position 3 -> good.

Similarly, ""SPRIG"": S(1), P(2), R(3), I(4), G(5). R in position 3.

Another word: ""ROBOT"" -> but R in position 1, but it has O and B and T. However, we have to avoid A, C, N, E. ""ROBOT"" avoids these. But note: we have two O's? Actually, ""ROBOT"" has two O's? R-O-B-O-T -> two O's? Actually, no: R, O, B, O, T -> two O's. That might not be ideal because we are trying to get more information, and repeating a letter might reduce the information. But if the word has duplicate letters, that's okay if the secret word has duplicates, but we don't know. So it's better to use distinct letters to maximize information.

Therefore, ""THROW"" and ""SPRIG"" have distinct letters.

Another word: ""DRUID"" -> D, R, U, I, D -> has two D's? Not distinct. Also, D is in position 1 and 5? So not ideal.

""PRISM"": P, R, I, S, M -> distinct and avoids A, C, N, E. R is in position 2? Wait: P(1), R(2), I(3), S(4), M(5). But we know R is not in position 2? Actually, we know that in the secret word, R is not in position 2. But we can still put R in position 2 in our guess? It would be inefficient because we already know that position 2 is not R. So we should avoid putting R in position 2.

Therefore, we want a word that has R in a position other than 2 and avoids A, C, N, E.

So ""PRISM"" has R in position 2 -> not good.

""THROW"": R in position 3 -> good.
""SPRIG"": R in position 3 -> good.

Another one: ""ROWDY"": R(1), O(2), W(3), D(4), Y(5) -> avoids A, C, N, E. R is in position 1 -> good.

But ""ROWDY"" has O in position 2. We don't know about O.

Alternatively, ""ROTLS"" is not a word. 

""ROILS"": R(1), O(2), I(3), L(4), S(5) -> valid? Yes, ""roils"". Avoids A, C, N, E.

But we have to consider that we are also testing other common letters.

I think ""THROW"" is a good candidate because it has T, H, R, O, W. T and H are common.

Similarly, ""SPRIG"" has S, P, R, I, G. S and I are common.

Another candidate: ""BRUSH"" -> B, R, U, S, H. But we don't know about B, U, S, H. And R is in position 2? B(1), R(2) -> again, position 2 for R, which we want to avoid.

So we must avoid position 2 for R.

Let me list words with R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Position 1: 
- Words starting with R: e.g., ""ROBOT"" (but two O's), ""ROWDY"", ""ROILS"", ""RUSTS"" (two S's), ""RUMPS"", ""RUMPS"" is not common? ""RUMPS"" is a word? Actually, ""rump"" is singular, but ""rumps"" is plural. But let's stick to common words.

Position 3:
- Words with R in third position: ""THROW"", ""SPRIG"", ""SHIRT"" (but H, I, R, T -> and avoids A, C, N, E? ""SHIRT"": S, H, I, R, T -> yes, avoids A, C, N, E). Also, R is in position 4? Let's see: S(1), H(2), I(3), R(4), T(5). So R is in position 4? Actually, in ""SHIRT"", the positions are:
  S:1, H:2, I:3, R:4, T:5 -> so R is in position 4.

Wait, I think I miscounted. In ""SHIRT"":
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: H
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: R
- Position 5: T

So R is in position 4.

Similarly, ""SPRIG"": 
- S:1, P:2, R:3, I:4, G:5 -> R in position 3.

""THROW"":
- T:1, H:2, R:3, O:4, W:5 -> R in position 3.

Position 5: 
- Words ending with R: e.g., ""RUMOR"" (but two R's and two O's? R,U,M,O,R -> two R's and two O's) -> not distinct. ""TUMOR"" (T,U,M,O,R) -> distinct? T,U,M,O,R -> distinct. And avoids A, C, N, E. So ""TUMOR"" has R in position 5.

But we don't know if T, U, M, O are in the word.

Now, we have to choose one. We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let's compare:

Option 1: ""THROW"" - tests T, H, R, O, W. R is in position 3 (which is new, not position 2). We avoid A, C, N, E.

Option 2: ""SPRIG"" - tests S, P, R, I, G. R in position 3.

Option 3: ""SHIRT"" - tests S, H, I, R, T. R in position 4.

Option 4: ""ROWDY"" - tests R, O, W, D, Y. R in position 1.

Option 5: ""TUMOR"" - tests T, U, M, O, R. R in position 5.

We know R is in the word, so we are guaranteed to get at least one hit on R. The other letters are new.

We want to maximize the chance of getting more correct positions or at least more present letters.

Since we have no other information, any of these are fine. But note that we have 5 letters to test and we want to cover common letters.

Common letters in 5-letter words (excluding A, E, I, O, U? But we haven't tested all vowels. We know A and E are absent, but O and I and U are still possible).

We have eliminated A and E (vowels) and C, N (consonants). So the vowels that might be present: I, O, U.

Consonants: we have R, and others.

In the remaining, the most common letters are: S, T, L, O, I, etc.

So ""THROW"" has T, H, O, W and R (which we know is present). H and W are less common.

""SPRIG"" has S, P, I, G. S and I are common.

""SHIRT"" has S, H, I, T. S, T, I are common.

""ROWDY"" has O, W, D, Y. O is common, but W, D, Y are less common.

""TUMOR"" has T, U, M, O. T and O are common.

So ""SHIRT"" and ""THROW"" and ""SPRIG"" are good.

But note: in ""SHIRT"", we are testing S, H, I, R, T. And R is in position 4.

In ""THROW"", we are testing T, H, R, O, W. R in position 3.

In ""SPRIG"", we are testing S, P, R, I, G. R in position 3.

I think ""SHIRT"" is a good choice because it has S, T, I which are very common, and H is also common. Also, it tests R in a new position (4).

Alternatively, we could choose a word that has R and also other common letters, and avoid the absent ones.

Another word: ""TRIOS"" -> T, R, I, O, S -> but R is in position 2? T(1), R(2), I(3), O(4), S(5). We want to avoid position 2 for R. So not good.

""STORM"": S, T, O, R, M -> R in position 4? S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), M(5). So R in position 4. And avoids A, C, N, E. This tests S, T, O, R, M. O is a vowel we haven't tested. This is also a good candidate.

But we already have ""SHIRT"" and ""STORM"".

I think I'll go with ""SHIRT"" because it has more common letters: S, T, I, R, H.

But let's check: in ""SHIRT"", we have I and T and S, which are common.

Alternatively, ""STORM"" has S, T, O, R, M. O is a vowel we haven't tested.

But we know that A and E are absent, so the vowel must be I, O, or U. Testing O might be good.

But we can also test I.

Since we have limited guesses, we want to cover as many common letters as possible.

The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... but we know A, E, N are absent. So T, O, I, S are the next.

So a word that includes T, O, I, S would be ideal, but we also have to include R and avoid A, C, N, E.

Is there a word that has T, O, I, S and R? But we have 5 positions. For example, ""TROIS"" (which is a word, meaning plural of trois, but it's French and might not be in the word list? In Wordle, it might be accepted, but let's stick to common English words). ""ROIST"" is not a word.

""RIOTS"": R, I, O, T, S -> but R is in position 1? And avoids A, C, N, E. ""RIOTS"" is a valid word. R(1), I(2), O(3), T(4), S(5). But we are putting R in position 1, which is fine (not position 2). This word tests R, I, O, T, S. That's five very common letters (except R we already know is present). This is excellent because we test I, O, T, S, all common, and R.

But note: we are putting I in position 2 and O in position 3, etc. We don't know the positions, but we are covering many common letters.

Is ""RIOTS"" a valid word? Yes, meaning a violent disturbance.

So I think ""RIOTS"" is a very good choice.

Alternatively, if we are concerned about the position of R, we know R is not in position 2, but we are putting it in position 1, which is a new position.

But wait, in ""RIOTS"", we have R in position 1. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing it.

We can also consider ""ROTIS"" (a type of bread) but that might be less common.

I think ""RIOTS"" is acceptable.

But let me confirm: we are avoiding A, C, N, E? Yes.

So the word is ""RIOTS"".

Alternatively, if we want to avoid repeating the same structure, but I think it's fine.

Another word: ""SIRUP"" (variant of syrup) but it has U and P, and we might not want to use U if we can avoid it? But it's okay.

But ""RIOTS"" seems better.

So I'll go with ""RIOTS"".

But note: we have to make sure that the word is in the word list. Since the game uses valid English words, and ""riots"" is common, it should be.

Therefore, the next guess is ""RIOTS"".

But let's double-check the feedback we have: we know R is in the word, but not in position 2. In ""RIOTS"", R is in position 1, which is a new position. We are testing I in position 2, O in position 3, T in position 4, S in position 5.

This should give us good information.

So the guess is ""RIOTS"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- R is in the secret word but not in the second position (marked with ""-"").

For the next guess:
- The word must include R (since it is confirmed to be in the secret word) and avoid C, A, N, E (since they are absent).

However, we have to avoid A, C, N, E, which it does.\n- ""THROW"": T, H, R, O, W -> avoids A, C, N, E. But note: we have R and we can put it in a different position. In ""crane"", R was in position 2. In ""THROW"", R is in position 3. Also, we get to test T, H, O, W.\n\nAnother option: ""PROUD"" (P, R, O, U, D) -> R in position 2? Actually, in ""PROUD"", R is in position 2. But we already know R is not in position 2? Wait, no: the feedback for ""crane"" said R is in the word but not in position 2. So we can try R in position 2 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it\'s not there. The feedback already told us that R is not in position 2, so we should avoid putting R in position 2 again.\n\nTherefore, in the next guess, we should put R in a position other than 2.\n\nSo for ""THROW"": positions: T(1), H(2), R(3), O(4), W(5). R is in position 3 -> good.\n\nSimilarly, ""SPRIG"": S(1), P(2), R(3), I(4), G(5). R in position 3.\n\nAnother word: ""ROBOT"" -> but R in position 1, but it has O and B and T. However, we have to avoid A, C, N, E. ""ROBOT"" avoids these. But note: we have two O\'s? Actually, ""ROBOT"" has two O\'s? R-O-B-O-T -> two O\'s? Actually, no: R, O, B, O, T -> two O\'s. That might not be ideal because we are trying to get more information, and repeating a letter might reduce the information. But if the word has duplicate letters, that\'s okay if the secret word has duplicates, but we don\'t know. So it\'s better to use distinct letters to maximize information.\n\nTherefore, ""THROW"" and ""SPRIG"" have distinct letters.\n\nAnother word: ""DRUID"" -> D, R, U, I, D -> has two D\'s? Not distinct. Also, D is in position 1 and 5? So not ideal.\n\n""PRISM"": P, R, I, S, M -> distinct and avoids A, C, N, E. R is in position 2? Wait: P(1), R(2), I(3), S(4), M(5). But we know R is not in position 2? Actually, we know that in the secret word, R is not in position 2. But we can still put R in position 2 in our guess? It would be inefficient because we already know that position 2 is not R. So we should avoid putting R in position 2.\n\nTherefore, we want a word that has R in a position other than 2 and avoids A, C, N, E.\n\nSo ""PRISM"" has R in position 2 -> not good.\n\n""THROW"": R in position 3 -> good.\n""SPRIG"": R in position 3 -> good.\n\nAnother one: ""ROWDY"": R(1), O(2), W(3), D(4), Y(5) -> avoids A, C, N, E. R is in position 1 -> good.\n\nBut ""ROWDY"" has O in position 2. We don\'t know about O.\n\nAlternatively, ""ROTLS"" is not a word. \n\n""ROILS"": R(1), O(2), I(3), L(4), S(5) -> valid? Yes, ""roils"". Avoids A, C, N, E.\n\nBut we have to consider that we are also testing other common letters.\n\nI think ""THROW"" is a good candidate because it has T, H, R, O, W. T and H are common.\n\nSimilarly, ""SPRIG"" has S, P, R, I, G. S and I are common.\n\nAnother candidate: ""BRUSH"" -> B, R, U, S, H. But we don\'t know about B, U, S, H. And R is in position 2? B(1), R(2) -> again, position 2 for R, which we want to avoid.\n\nSo we must avoid position 2 for R.\n\nLet me list words with R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\nPosition 1: \n- Words starting with R: e.g., ""ROBOT"" (but two O\'s), ""ROWDY"", ""ROILS"", ""RUSTS"" (two S\'s), ""RUMPS"", ""RUMPS"" is not common? ""RUMPS"" is a word? Actually, ""rump"" is singular, but ""rumps"" is plural. But let\'s stick to common words.\n\nPosition 3:\n- Words with R in third position: ""THROW"", ""SPRIG"", ""SHIRT"" (but H, I, R, T -> and avoids A, C, N, E? ""SHIRT"": S, H, I, R, T -> yes, avoids A, C, N, E). Also, R is in position 4? Let\'s see: S(1), H(2), I(3), R(4), T(5). So R is in position 4? Actually, in ""SHIRT"", the positions are:\n  S:1, H:2, I:3, R:4, T:5 -> so R is in position 4.\n\nWait, I think I miscounted. In ""SHIRT"":\n- Position 1: S\n- Position 2: H\n- Position 3: I\n- Position 4: R\n- Position 5: T\n\nSo R is in position 4.\n\nSimilarly, ""SPRIG"": \n- S:1, P:2, R:3, I:4, G:5 -> R in position 3.\n\n""THROW"":\n- T:1, H:2, R:3, O:4, W:5 -> R in position 3.\n\nPosition 5: \n- Words ending with R: e.g., ""RUMOR"" (but two R\'s and two O\'s? R,U,M,O,R -> two R\'s and two O\'s) -> not distinct. ""TUMOR"" (T,U,M,O,R) -> distinct? T,U,M,O,R -> distinct. And avoids A, C, N, E. So ""TUMOR"" has R in position 5.\n\nBut we don\'t know if T, U, M, O are in the word.\n\nNow, we have to choose one. We want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nLet\'s compare:\n\nOption 1: ""THROW"" - tests T, H, R, O, W. R is in position 3 (which is new, not position 2). We avoid A, C, N, E.\n\nOption 2: ""SPRIG"" - tests S, P, R, I, G. R in position 3.\n\nOption 3: ""SHIRT"" - tests S, H, I, R, T. R in position 4.\n\nOption 4: ""ROWDY"" - tests R, O, W, D, Y. R in position 1.\n\nOption 5: ""TUMOR"" - tests T, U, M, O, R. R in position 5.\n\nWe know R is in the word, so we are guaranteed to get at least one hit on R. The other letters are new.\n\nWe want to maximize the chance of getting more correct positions or at least more present letters.\n\nSince we have no other information, any of these are fine. But note that we have 5 letters to test and we want to cover common letters.\n\nCommon letters in 5-letter words (excluding A, E, I, O, U? But we haven\'t tested all vowels. We know A and E are absent, but O and I and U are still possible).\n\nWe have eliminated A and E (vowels) and C, N (consonants). So the vowels that might be present: I, O, U.\n\nConsonants: we have R, and others.\n\nIn the remaining, the most common letters are: S, T, L, O, I, etc.\n\nSo ""THROW"" has T, H, O, W and R (which we know is present). H and W are less common.\n\n""SPRIG"" has S, P, I, G. S and I are common.\n\n""SHIRT"" has S, H, I, T. S, T, I are common.\n\n""ROWDY"" has O, W, D, Y. O is common, but W, D, Y are less common.\n\n""TUMOR"" has T, U, M, O. T and O are common.\n\nSo ""SHIRT"" and ""THROW"" and ""SPRIG"" are good.\n\nBut note: in ""SHIRT"", we are testing S, H, I, R, T. And R is in position 4.\n\nIn ""THROW"", we are testing T, H, R, O, W. R in position 3.\n\nIn ""SPRIG"", we are testing S, P, R, I, G. R in position 3.\n\nI think ""SHIRT"" is a good choice because it has S, T, I which are very common, and H is also common. Also, it tests R in a new position (4).\n\nAlternatively, we could choose a word that has R and also other common letters, and avoid the absent ones.\n\nAnother word: ""TRIOS"" -> T, R, I, O, S -> but R is in position 2? T(1), R(2), I(3), O(4), S(5). We want to avoid position 2 for R. So not good.\n\n""STORM"": S, T, O, R, M -> R in position 4? S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), M(5). So R in position 4. And avoids A, C, N, E. This tests S, T, O, R, M. O is a vowel we haven\'t tested. This is also a good candidate.\n\nBut we already have ""SHIRT"" and ""STORM"".\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""SHIRT"" because it has more common letters: S, T, I, R, H.\n\nBut let\'s check: in ""SHIRT"", we have I and T and S, which are common.\n\nAlternatively, ""STORM"" has S, T, O, R, M. O is a vowel we haven\'t tested.\n\nBut we know that A and E are absent, so the vowel must be I, O, or U. Testing O might be good.\n\nBut we can also test I.\n\nSince we have limited guesses, we want to cover as many common letters as possible.\n\nThe most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... but we know A, E, N are absent. So T, O, I, S are the next.\n\nSo a word that includes T, O, I, S would be ideal, but we also have to include R and avoid A, C, N, E.\n\nIs there a word that has T, O, I, S and R? But we have 5 positions. For example, ""TROIS"" (which is a word, meaning plural of trois, but it\'s French and might not be in the word list? In Wordle, it might be accepted, but let\'s stick to common English words). ""ROIST"" is not a word.\n\n""RIOTS"": R, I, O, T, S -> but R is in position 1? And avoids A, C, N, E. ""RIOTS"" is a valid word. R(1), I(2), O(3), T(4), S(5). But we are putting R in position 1, which is fine (not position 2). This word tests R, I, O, T, S. That\'s five very common letters (except R we already know is present). This is excellent because we test I, O, T, S, all common, and R.\n\nBut note: we are putting I in position 2 and O in position 3, etc. We don\'t know the positions, but we are covering many common letters.\n\nIs ""RIOTS"" a valid word? Yes, meaning a violent disturbance.\n\nSo I think ""RIOTS"" is a very good choice.\n\nAlternatively, if we are concerned about the position of R, we know R is not in position 2, but we are putting it in position 1, which is a new position.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""RIOTS"".\n\nBut wait, in ""RIOTS"", we have R in position 1. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing it.\n\nWe can also consider ""ROTIS"" (a type of bread) but that might be less common.\n\nI think ""RIOTS"" is acceptable.\n\nBut let me confirm: we are avoiding A, C, N, E? Yes.\n\nSo the word is ""RIOTS"".\n\nAlternatively, if we want to avoid repeating the same structure, but I think it\'s fine.\n\nAnother word: ""SIRUP"" (variant of syrup) but it has U and P, and we might not want to use U if we can avoid it? But it\'s okay.\n\nBut ""RIOTS"" seems better.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""RIOTS"".\n\nBut note: we have to make sure that the word is in the word list. Since the game uses valid English words, and ""riots"" is common, it should be.\n\nTherefore, the next guess is ""RIOTS"".\n\nBut let\'s double-check the feedback we have: we know R is in the word, but not in position 2. In ""RIOTS"", R is in position 1, which is a new position. We are testing I in position 2, O in position 3, T in position 4, S in position 5.\n\nThis should give us good information.\n\nSo the guess is ""RIOTS"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").\n- R is in the secret word but not in the second position (marked with ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- The word must include R (since it is confirmed to be in the secret word) and avoid C, A, N, E (since they are absent).\n- R should be placed in a position other than the second one to test new locations (e.g., position 1, 3, 4, or 5).\n- To maximize information, the guess should use common letters not yet tested (like S, T, I, O) and avoid repeating known absent letters.\n\nThe word ""riots"" meets these criteria:\n- It contains R (in position 1, a new position to test).\n- It avoids C, A, N, E.\n- It introduces new common letters: S, T, I, O.\n- All letters are distinct, which helps gather more information about the secret word.\n\n<guess>riots</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: riots -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) O(-) T(x) S(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
- This means:
  - C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.
  - R is in the word but not in position 2.

Guess 2: ""riots"" -> Feedback: R(-) I(x) O(-) T(x) S(x)
- Interpretation:
  - R is in the word but not in position 1 (since we placed it in position 1 and got '-', meaning it's present but not there).
  - I, T, S are not in the word at all.
  - O is in the word but not in position 3 (since we placed O in position 3 and got '-').

So, from both guesses, we know:

1. The secret word contains the letters: R and O.
   - R is not in position 1 or 2 (from guess 1 and 2).
   - O is not in position 3 (from guess 2).

2. The following letters are absent: C, A, N, E, I, T, S.

We have eliminated 9 letters: C, A, N, E, I, T, S.

The secret word has 5 letters, and we know two of them: R and O.

We need to find the remaining three letters, which must be from the remaining alphabet (excluding the 9 eliminated letters and the two known).

Alphabet: 26 letters. Eliminated: C, A, N, E, I, T, S. That's 7 letters? Wait, let's list:

Eliminated: C, A, N, E, I, T, S. That's 7 letters.

But we also have R and O which are present, so we don't eliminate them. The remaining letters are:

B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We have 17 letters left, but we only need 3 more for the word (since R and O are already two of the five).

Also, note that the word must have R and O, and three other letters from the above.

Moreover, we know the positions where R and O cannot be:

- R cannot be in position 1 or 2.
- O cannot be in position 3.

So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

O must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).

Now, for the next guess, we want to test possible positions for R and O, and also test new letters.

We should choose a word that:
- Includes R and O (since we know they are in the word) and places them in positions we haven't tried for each.
- Avoids the eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, I, T, S.
- Uses common letters from the remaining set to maximize the chance of hitting.

Let's think of words that have R and O, and three other letters from B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also want to test R in a new position: since we tried position 1 and 2 (and they were wrong for R), we should try R in position 3, 4, or 5.

Similarly, for O, we tried position 3 (which was wrong), so we should try O in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

But we can try to fix one of them.

Let's list possible positions:

For R: positions 3,4,5
For O: positions 1,2,4,5

But note: if we put R and O in the same word, we have to assign them to different positions.

We also want to test other common letters. Common letters from the remaining: L, M, P, U, D, G, H, etc.

Let's try to form words.

Option: put R in position 3 and O in position 1? For example: O _ R _ _

But we need to fill the blanks.

Word: ""O R something""? But we have to avoid the eliminated letters.

Example: ""FORUM"" -> but F, O, R, U, M. Positions: O(1)? No, ""FORUM"" is F(1), O(2), R(3), U(4), M(5). So O is in position 2 and R in position 3.

This avoids the eliminated letters? F, O, R, U, M: none of C,A,N,E,I,T,S. So yes.

But we haven't tested O in position 2 or R in position 3 before? We tried R in position 2 (in ""crane"") and position 1 (in ""riots""), so position 3 is new for R. We tried O in position 3 (in ""riots""), so position 2 is new for O.

So ""FORUM"" could be a candidate.

Another option: put O in position 1 and R in position 4? For example: O _ _ R _

Word: ""DOZER"" -> but D, O, Z, E, R -> E is eliminated (from first guess). So not allowed.

Word: ""POWER"" -> P, O, W, E, R -> E is eliminated. Not allowed.

Word: ""BOXER"" -> B, O, X, E, R -> E eliminated.

Word: ""JOKER"" -> J, O, K, E, R -> E eliminated.

So avoiding E is hard for O in position 1 and R in position 5? Actually, in ""JOKER"", R is in position 5.

But E is in position 4, which is eliminated.

Alternative: ""GOURD"" -> G, O, U, R, D. Positions: O(2), R(4). So O in position 2 and R in position 4.

This avoids eliminated letters: G, O, U, R, D -> all in the allowed set.

We haven't tried O in position 2 or R in position 4.

Similarly, ""MOURN"" -> M, O, U, R, N -> but N is eliminated (from first guess). Not allowed.

""FOUR"" is 4 letters, not 5.

""DOUR"" is not 5.

""POUR"" is 4.

""ROUND"" -> R, O, U, N, D -> N eliminated.

""BOUND"" -> B, O, U, N, D -> N eliminated.

""FOUND"" -> same.

So ""GOURD"" is a valid word: G, O, U, R, D.

Another candidate: ""HOUR"" is 4 letters.

""LOURY"" is not a word.

""PROUD"" -> P, R, O, U, D -> but R is in position 1? P(1), R(2), O(3), U(4), D(5). But we know R cannot be in position 2 (from first guess). So we cannot put R in position 2. So ""PROUD"" is invalid because R is in position 2.

Similarly, ""CROWD"" -> C is eliminated.

""BROWN"" -> B, R, O, W, N -> N eliminated.

""GROWL"" -> G, R, O, W, L -> avoids eliminated letters? G, R, O, W, L: none of the eliminated. And positions: R in position 2? G(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), L(5). But R in position 2 is not allowed (we know it's not in position 2). So invalid.

""ROW"" is 3 letters.

What about putting R in position 5? For example: _ _ _ _ R

And O in position 1: O _ _ _ R

Word: ""O something something something R""

Example: ""OAKER"" -> O, A, K, E, R -> A and E eliminated.

Not possible.

O in position 2: _ O _ _ R

Word: ""DOZER"" -> E eliminated.

""POKER"" -> E eliminated.

""JOKER"" -> E eliminated.

""LOVER"" -> E and L? L is allowed, but E is eliminated.

""MOVIE"" -> M, O, V, I, E -> I and E eliminated.

So it's hard to have R at the end.

Perhaps O in position 4 and R in position 3: _ _ R O _

Word: ""BRO"" is 3 letters.

""PRO"" is 3.

""FROM"" is 4.

""GROOM"" -> G, R, O, O, M -> two O's? And we don't know if O is repeated. But it's possible. Positions: G(1), R(2), O(3), O(4), M(5). But R is in position 2 -> not allowed.

""BROOM"" -> same, R in position 2.

""FROWN"" -> F, R, O, W, N -> N eliminated.

""GROWL"" -> R in position 2.

So that doesn't work.

O in position 5: _ _ _ _ O, and R in position 3: _ _ R _ O

Word: ""something R something O""

Example: ""BARDO"" -> B, A, R, D, O -> A eliminated.

""CARDO"" -> C and A eliminated.

""HERDO"" -> H, E, R, D, O -> E eliminated.

""VERDO"" -> not a word.

""WORD"" is 4 letters.

""CHORD"" -> C and H? C eliminated.

So it's challenging.

Back to the candidates we have:

1. ""FORUM"": F(1), O(2), R(3), U(4), M(5) -> tests F, U, M as new letters, and O in position 2, R in position 3.

2. ""GOURD"": G(1), O(2), U(3), R(4), D(5) -> tests G, U, D, and O in position 2, R in position 4.

We also have the option of putting R in position 5 and O in position 2? For example: _ O _ _ R

But we couldn't find a word without eliminated letters.

Another candidate: ""HORDE"" -> H, O, R, D, E -> E eliminated. Not allowed.

""LORDE"" -> L, O, R, D, E -> E eliminated.

""YOUR"" is 4 letters.

""FLOUR"" -> F, L, O, U, R -> but R is in position 5? F(1), L(2), O(3), U(4), R(5). So O in position 3? But we know O is not in position 3 (from guess 2: in ""riots"", O was in position 3 and got '-', meaning it is present but not in position 3). So we cannot put O in position 3 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we already know it's not there. We should avoid position 3 for O.

Therefore, in ""FLOUR"", O is in position 3, which we know is wrong, so we shouldn't use that.

Similarly, we should avoid positions we know are wrong for the known letters.

So for O, avoid position 3. For R, avoid positions 1 and 2.

Therefore, in ""FORUM"": O is in position 2 (which is allowed, since we haven't tested O in position 2) and R in position 3 (which is allowed, not 1 or 2).

In ""GOURD"": O in position 2 (allowed) and R in position 4 (allowed).

Now, which one to choose? Both are valid.

We can also consider other words.

Another word: ""POUR"" is 4 letters.

""DOUGH"" -> D, O, U, G, H -> but no R? We must include R because we know it's in the word. So we cannot skip R.

We must include both R and O.

Another word: ""ROGUY"" not a word.

""ROWDY"" -> R, O, W, D, Y -> but R is in position 1? We tried R in position 1 in ""riots"" and it was wrong (got '-'). So we know R is not in position 1. So we cannot put R in position 1. ""ROWDY"" has R in position 1 -> invalid.

""ROWDY"" is not allowed.

""ROBOT"" -> R in position 1 (invalid) and O in position 2? And also has B and O and T? T is eliminated. Not allowed.

""BROOD"" -> R in position 2 (invalid) and O repeated.

So back to ""FORUM"" and ""GOURD"".

We can also try ""MOURN"" but N is eliminated.

""FJORD"" -> F, J, O, R, D -> positions: F(1), J(2), O(3), R(4), D(5). But O is in position 3, which we know is wrong (because in ""riots"", O in position 3 was misplaced, meaning it's not there). So we should avoid O in position 3. Therefore, ""FJORD"" is invalid.

Similarly, ""WORDY"" -> W, O, R, D, Y -> positions: W(1), O(2), R(3), D(4), Y(5). So O in position 2 and R in position 3. This avoids eliminated letters? W, O, R, D, Y: none of C,A,N,E,I,T,S. And we haven't tested O in position 2 or R in position 3. So ""WORDY"" is a valid candidate.

Now we have three candidates: ""FORUM"", ""GOURD"", ""WORDY"".

Let's list them:

1. ""FORUM"": tests F, O, R, U, M. O in pos2, R in pos3.
2. ""GOURD"": tests G, O, U, R, D. O in pos2, R in pos4.
3. ""WORDY"": tests W, O, R, D, Y. O in pos2, R in pos3.

We want to choose the one that tests the most common letters. Common letters from the remaining: D, H, L, M, P, U, etc.

F, U, M are not the most common, but we don't have frequency data. Similarly, G, U, D or W, D, Y.

But note that we have already eliminated many common letters, so we have to work with what's left.

Another factor: we know the word has O and R, and we are trying to find the other three. We might get more information if we test different positions.

In ""FORUM"" and ""WORDY"", R is in position 3, which is the same. In ""GOURD"", R is in position 4, which is different.

Similarly, O is in position 2 in all three.

We might want to test R in a position we haven't tried: we tried position 1 and 2 (wrong), so position 3,4,5 are open. Testing position 4 (as in ""GOURD"") might be good because it's a new position for R.

In ""FORUM"" and ""WORDY"", we are testing R in position 3, which is new, but we are testing two different sets of letters.

But we can only choose one.

Alternatively, we can consider how many new letters we are testing. But all are new.

I think ""GOURD"" is a good choice because it tests R in position 4, which we haven't tried, and O in position 2, which is new for O (we only tried O in position 3 before).

Also, ""GOURD"" uses G, U, D which are reasonably common.

""WORDY"" uses W, D, Y; W and Y are less common.

""FORUM"" uses F, U, M; F and M are common.

But let's pick ""GOURD"" to test R in position 4.

Another candidate: ""DOUGH"" doesn't have R.

""GOURD"" is a word, meaning a fleshy fruit.

So I'll go with ""GOURD"".

But let's see if there's a word that tests more common letters. For example, with L or P.

Word: ""PROWL"" -> P, R, O, W, L -> but R in position 2? Not allowed.

""ROLL"" is 4.

""POLAR"" -> P, O, L, A, R -> A eliminated.

""SOLAR"" -> S eliminated.

""VOTER"" -> V, O, T, E, R -> T and E eliminated.

""LOVER"" -> E eliminated.

""POWER"" -> E eliminated.

""GLOVE"" -> E eliminated.

So I think ""GOURD"" is acceptable.

Therefore, the next guess is ""GOURD"".

But note: we must avoid the eliminated letters, and ""GOURD"" does: G, O, U, R, D.

And positions: O in 2, R in 4.

So <guess>gourd</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(absent), R(present but wrong position), A(absent), N(absent), E(absent).  
  - This means:  
    - R is in the secret word, but not in position 2.  
    - C, A, N, E are not in the secret word.  

- **Guess 2: ""riots""** → Feedback: R(present but wrong position), I(absent), O(present but wrong position), T(absent), S(absent).  
  - This means:  
    - R is in the secret word but not in position 1 (since it was misplaced in both guesses, positions 1 and 2 are now invalid for R).  
    - O is in the secret word but not in position 3.  
    - I, T, S are not in the secret word.  

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed letters in the secret word**: R and O.  
- **Eliminated letters (absent)**: C, A, N, E, I, T, S (7 letters total).  
- **Possible positions for R**: Must be in position 3, 4, or 5 (since positions 1 and 2 are invalid).  
- **Possible positions for O**: Must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since position 3 is invalid).  
- **Remaining letters to choose from**: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (17 letters). The secret word has 3 unknown letters from this set, plus R and O.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Include R and O**: Since both are confirmed in the word, we must test them in new positions:  
  - R: Try position 4 (not tested yet, as positions 1 and 2 were invalid).  
  - O: Try position 2 (not tested yet, as position 3 was invalid).  
- **Avoid eliminated letters**: Do not use C, A, N, E, I, T, S.  
- **Test new common letters**: Focus on frequent consonants like D, G, L, M, P, U to maximize information.  
- **Word selection**: After evaluating options, ""gourd"" fits well:  
  - Uses R (position 4) and O (position 2), both in untested positions.  
  - Introduces new letters: G, U, D (all common and untested).  
  - Avoids eliminated letters.  

**Next guess: ""gourd""** (G in position 1, O in position 2, U in position 3, R in position 4, D in position 5).  

<guess>gourd</guess>",gourd,"We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
- This means:
  - C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.
  - R is in the word but not in position 2.

Guess 2: ""riots"" -> Feedback: R(-) I(x) O(-) T(x) S(x)
- Interpretation:
  - R is in the word but not in position 1 (since we placed it in position 1 and got '-', meaning it's present but not there).
  - I, T, S are not in the word at all.
  - O is in the word but not in position 3 (since we placed O in position 3 and got '-').

So, from both guesses, we know:

1. The secret word contains the letters: R and O.
   - R is not in position 1 or 2 (from guess 1 and 2).
   - O is not in position 3 (from guess 2).

2. The following letters are absent: C, A, N, E, I, T, S.

We have eliminated 9 letters: C, A, N, E, I, T, S.

The secret word has 5 letters, and we know two of them: R and O.

We need to find the remaining three letters, which must be from the remaining alphabet (excluding the 9 eliminated letters and the two known).

Alphabet: 26 letters. Eliminated: C, A, N, E, I, T, S. That's 7 letters? Wait, let's list:

Eliminated: C, A, N, E, I, T, S. That's 7 letters.

But we also have R and O which are present, so we don't eliminate them. The remaining letters are:

B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We have 17 letters left, but we only need 3 more for the word (since R and O are already two of the five).

Also, note that the word must have R and O, and three other letters from the above.

Moreover, we know the positions where R and O cannot be:

- R cannot be in position 1 or 2.
- O cannot be in position 3.

So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

O must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).

Now, for the next guess, we want to test possible positions for R and O, and also test new letters.

We should choose a word that:
- Includes R and O (since we know they are in the word) and places them in positions we haven't tried for each.
- Avoids the eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, I, T, S.
- Uses common letters from the remaining set to maximize the chance of hitting.

Let's think of words that have R and O, and three other letters from B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also want to test R in a new position: since we tried position 1 and 2 (and they were wrong for R), we should try R in position 3, 4, or 5.

Similarly, for O, we tried position 3 (which was wrong), so we should try O in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

But we can try to fix one of them.

Let's list possible positions:

For R: positions 3,4,5
For O: positions 1,2,4,5

But note: if we put R and O in the same word, we have to assign them to different positions.

We also want to test other common letters. Common letters from the remaining: L, M, P, U, D, G, H, etc.

Let's try to form words.

Option: put R in position 3 and O in position 1? For example: O _ R _ _

But we need to fill the blanks.

Word: ""O R something""? But we have to avoid the eliminated letters.

Example: ""FORUM"" -> but F, O, R, U, M. Positions: O(1)? No, ""FORUM"" is F(1), O(2), R(3), U(4), M(5). So O is in position 2 and R in position 3.

This avoids the eliminated letters? F, O, R, U, M: none of C,A,N,E,I,T,S. So yes.

But we haven't tested O in position 2 or R in position 3 before? We tried R in position 2 (in ""crane"") and position 1 (in ""riots""), so position 3 is new for R. We tried O in position 3 (in ""riots""), so position 2 is new for O.

So ""FORUM"" could be a candidate.

Another option: put O in position 1 and R in position 4? For example: O _ _ R _

Word: ""DOZER"" -> but D, O, Z, E, R -> E is eliminated (from first guess). So not allowed.

Word: ""POWER"" -> P, O, W, E, R -> E is eliminated. Not allowed.

Word: ""BOXER"" -> B, O, X, E, R -> E eliminated.

Word: ""JOKER"" -> J, O, K, E, R -> E eliminated.

So avoiding E is hard for O in position 1 and R in position 5? Actually, in ""JOKER"", R is in position 5.

But E is in position 4, which is eliminated.

Alternative: ""GOURD"" -> G, O, U, R, D. Positions: O(2), R(4). So O in position 2 and R in position 4.

This avoids eliminated letters: G, O, U, R, D -> all in the allowed set.

We haven't tried O in position 2 or R in position 4.

Similarly, ""MOURN"" -> M, O, U, R, N -> but N is eliminated (from first guess). Not allowed.

""FOUR"" is 4 letters, not 5.

""DOUR"" is not 5.

""POUR"" is 4.

""ROUND"" -> R, O, U, N, D -> N eliminated.

""BOUND"" -> B, O, U, N, D -> N eliminated.

""FOUND"" -> same.

So ""GOURD"" is a valid word: G, O, U, R, D.

Another candidate: ""HOUR"" is 4 letters.

""LOURY"" is not a word.

""PROUD"" -> P, R, O, U, D -> but R is in position 1? P(1), R(2), O(3), U(4), D(5). But we know R cannot be in position 2 (from first guess). So we cannot put R in position 2. So ""PROUD"" is invalid because R is in position 2.

Similarly, ""CROWD"" -> C is eliminated.

""BROWN"" -> B, R, O, W, N -> N eliminated.

""GROWL"" -> G, R, O, W, L -> avoids eliminated letters? G, R, O, W, L: none of the eliminated. And positions: R in position 2? G(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), L(5). But R in position 2 is not allowed (we know it's not in position 2). So invalid.

""ROW"" is 3 letters.

What about putting R in position 5? For example: _ _ _ _ R

And O in position 1: O _ _ _ R

Word: ""O something something something R""

Example: ""OAKER"" -> O, A, K, E, R -> A and E eliminated.

Not possible.

O in position 2: _ O _ _ R

Word: ""DOZER"" -> E eliminated.

""POKER"" -> E eliminated.

""JOKER"" -> E eliminated.

""LOVER"" -> E and L? L is allowed, but E is eliminated.

""MOVIE"" -> M, O, V, I, E -> I and E eliminated.

So it's hard to have R at the end.

Perhaps O in position 4 and R in position 3: _ _ R O _

Word: ""BRO"" is 3 letters.

""PRO"" is 3.

""FROM"" is 4.

""GROOM"" -> G, R, O, O, M -> two O's? And we don't know if O is repeated. But it's possible. Positions: G(1), R(2), O(3), O(4), M(5). But R is in position 2 -> not allowed.

""BROOM"" -> same, R in position 2.

""FROWN"" -> F, R, O, W, N -> N eliminated.

""GROWL"" -> R in position 2.

So that doesn't work.

O in position 5: _ _ _ _ O, and R in position 3: _ _ R _ O

Word: ""something R something O""

Example: ""BARDO"" -> B, A, R, D, O -> A eliminated.

""CARDO"" -> C and A eliminated.

""HERDO"" -> H, E, R, D, O -> E eliminated.

""VERDO"" -> not a word.

""WORD"" is 4 letters.

""CHORD"" -> C and H? C eliminated.

So it's challenging.

Back to the candidates we have:

1. ""FORUM"": F(1), O(2), R(3), U(4), M(5) -> tests F, U, M as new letters, and O in position 2, R in position 3.

2. ""GOURD"": G(1), O(2), U(3), R(4), D(5) -> tests G, U, D, and O in position 2, R in position 4.

We also have the option of putting R in position 5 and O in position 2? For example: _ O _ _ R

But we couldn't find a word without eliminated letters.

Another candidate: ""HORDE"" -> H, O, R, D, E -> E eliminated. Not allowed.

""LORDE"" -> L, O, R, D, E -> E eliminated.

""YOUR"" is 4 letters.

""FLOUR"" -> F, L, O, U, R -> but R is in position 5? F(1), L(2), O(3), U(4), R(5). So O in position 3? But we know O is not in position 3 (from guess 2: in ""riots"", O was in position 3 and got '-', meaning it is present but not in position 3). So we cannot put O in position 3 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we already know it's not there. We should avoid position 3 for O.

Therefore, in ""FLOUR"", O is in position 3, which we know is wrong, so we shouldn't use that.

Similarly, we should avoid positions we know are wrong for the known letters.

So for O, avoid position 3. For R, avoid positions 1 and 2.

Therefore, in ""FORUM"": O is in position 2 (which is allowed, since we haven't tested O in position 2) and R in position 3 (which is allowed, not 1 or 2).

In ""GOURD"": O in position 2 (allowed) and R in position 4 (allowed).

Now, which one to choose? Both are valid.

We can also consider other words.

Another word: ""POUR"" is 4 letters.

""DOUGH"" -> D, O, U, G, H -> but no R? We must include R because we know it's in the word. So we cannot skip R.

We must include both R and O.

Another word: ""ROGUY"" not a word.

""ROWDY"" -> R, O, W, D, Y -> but R is in position 1? We tried R in position 1 in ""riots"" and it was wrong (got '-'). So we know R is not in position 1. So we cannot put R in position 1. ""ROWDY"" has R in position 1 -> invalid.

""ROWDY"" is not allowed.

""ROBOT"" -> R in position 1 (invalid) and O in position 2? And also has B and O and T? T is eliminated. Not allowed.

""BROOD"" -> R in position 2 (invalid) and O repeated.

So back to ""FORUM"" and ""GOURD"".

We can also try ""MOURN"" but N is eliminated.

""FJORD"" -> F, J, O, R, D -> positions: F(1), J(2), O(3), R(4), D(5). But O is in position 3, which we know is wrong (because in ""riots"", O in position 3 was misplaced, meaning it's not there). So we should avoid O in position 3. Therefore, ""FJORD"" is invalid.

Similarly, ""WORDY"" -> W, O, R, D, Y -> positions: W(1), O(2), R(3), D(4), Y(5). So O in position 2 and R in position 3. This avoids eliminated letters? W, O, R, D, Y: none of C,A,N,E,I,T,S. And we haven't tested O in position 2 or R in position 3. So ""WORDY"" is a valid candidate.

Now we have three candidates: ""FORUM"", ""GOURD"", ""WORDY"".

Let's list them:

1. ""FORUM"": tests F, O, R, U, M. O in pos2, R in pos3.
2. ""GOURD"": tests G, O, U, R, D. O in pos2, R in pos4.
3. ""WORDY"": tests W, O, R, D, Y. O in pos2, R in pos3.

We want to choose the one that tests the most common letters. Common letters from the remaining: D, H, L, M, P, U, etc.

F, U, M are not the most common, but we don't have frequency data. Similarly, G, U, D or W, D, Y.

But note that we have already eliminated many common letters, so we have to work with what's left.

Another factor: we know the word has O and R, and we are trying to find the other three. We might get more information if we test different positions.

In ""FORUM"" and ""WORDY"", R is in position 3, which is the same. In ""GOURD"", R is in position 4, which is different.

Similarly, O is in position 2 in all three.

We might want to test R in a position we haven't tried: we tried position 1 and 2 (wrong), so position 3,4,5 are open. Testing position 4 (as in ""GOURD"") might be good because it's a new position for R.

In ""FORUM"" and ""WORDY"", we are testing R in position 3, which is new, but we are testing two different sets of letters.

But we can only choose one.

Alternatively, we can consider how many new letters we are testing. But all are new.

I think ""GOURD"" is a good choice because it tests R in position 4, which we haven't tried, and O in position 2, which is new for O (we only tried O in position 3 before).

Also, ""GOURD"" uses G, U, D which are reasonably common.

""WORDY"" uses W, D, Y; W and Y are less common.

""FORUM"" uses F, U, M; F and M are common.

But let's pick ""GOURD"" to test R in position 4.

Another candidate: ""DOUGH"" doesn't have R.

""GOURD"" is a word, meaning a fleshy fruit.

So I'll go with ""GOURD"".

But let's see if there's a word that tests more common letters. For example, with L or P.

Word: ""PROWL"" -> P, R, O, W, L -> but R in position 2? Not allowed.

""ROLL"" is 4.

""POLAR"" -> P, O, L, A, R -> A eliminated.

""SOLAR"" -> S eliminated.

""VOTER"" -> V, O, T, E, R -> T and E eliminated.

""LOVER"" -> E eliminated.

""POWER"" -> E eliminated.

""GLOVE"" -> E eliminated.

So I think ""GOURD"" is acceptable.

Therefore, the next guess is ""GOURD"".

But note: we must avoid the eliminated letters, and ""GOURD"" does: G, O, U, R, D.

And positions: O in 2, R in 4.

So <guess>gourd</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(absent), R(present but wrong position), A(absent), N(absent), E(absent).  
  - This means:  
    - R is in the secret word, but not in position 2.  
    - C, A, N, E are not in the secret word.  

- **Guess 2: ""riots""** → Feedback: R(present but wrong position), I(absent), O(present but wrong position), T(absent), S(absent).  
  - This means:  
    - R is in the secret word but not in position 1 (since it was misplaced in both guesses, positions 1 and 2 are now invalid for R).  
    - O is in the secret word but not in position 3.  
    - I, T, S are not in the secret word.
