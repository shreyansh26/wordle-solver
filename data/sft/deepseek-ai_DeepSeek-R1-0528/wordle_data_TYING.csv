We have to start with a good first guess. Since it's the first guess, we don't have any information.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize the information we get.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me consider:
 - ""CRANE"": has C, R, A, N, E. It includes common letters and two vowels (A and E).
 - ""SLATE"": has S, L, A, T, E. Also common letters.

 However, note that we are not limited to these.

 Alternatively, let's choose ""ROAST"" as it has R, O, A, S, T. But I recall that ""RAISE"" is also a popular choice because it uses R, A, I, S, E (including vowels and common consonants).

 Another candidate: ""AUDIO"" but that has four vowels and might not cover common consonants as well.

 Considering we might get position info and letter existence, I'll go with ""RAISE"" because:
 - It has two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (R, I, S).
 - R, S, and E are very common letters.

 Therefore, let's guess ""RAISE"".

 But wait, note that the problem says ""valid 5-letter English word"". ""RAISE"" is valid.

 Let me confirm: R-A-I-S-E -> ""raise""

 Since this is the first guess, we are not building on previous feedback.

 So, I'll guess ""RAISE"".
</think>
<thinking>
For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good starting word typically contains common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to help identify possible matches early.

- Common high-frequency letters in English include R, S, T, L, N, E, and A.
- A balanced mix of vowels and consonants increases the chance of getting useful feedback (✓, -, or x) for multiple positions.

After evaluating common starting words like ""SLATE"", ""CRATE"", and ""ROAST"", I selected ""RAISE"" because:
- It includes three frequently appearing consonants: R, S, and E.
- It contains two vowels: A and I (both common).
- The word ""RAISE"" is frequently used in Wordle strategies for broad coverage.

This guess will provide feedback on:
- Position of R (if ✓ in position 1 or - elsewhere).
- Presence of A, I, S, or E across any positions.

This sets up a strong foundation for narrowing down subsequent guesses.

We are given feedback from the first guess: RAISE -> R(x) A(x) I(✓) S(x) E(x)
 This means:
 - I is in the secret word and in the CORRECT position (index 2, since counting starts at 0: R=0, A=1, I=2, S=3, E=4).
   So the secret word has I as the third letter: _ _ I _ _
 - R, A, S, and E are not in the word at all.

 Since we know the third letter is I, and the word is 5 letters: ? ? I ? ?

 We must avoid using the letters R, A, S, E because they are not in the word.

 For the next guess, we need to pick a valid 5-letter word that:
   - Has 'I' in the third position.
   - Does not contain R, A, S, E.

 Let's think of words ending with I in the third position.

 Since we haven't used many common consonants yet, we might consider including other common letters to test.

 Common consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Let's try to form a word that uses some of the most common remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, etc.

 Possibilities for positions: 
   Position 0: any consonant except R, A, S, E -> let's say T or C or L
   Position 1: similarly, we have many choices
   Position 3 and 4: also any except R, A, S, E.

 We can choose a word that tests several new common letters.

 Example words with I in the third position:
   ""THINK"": T-H-I-N-K -> but we have to check if it avoids R,A,S,E -> yes, it does.
   ""CLIMB"": C-L-I-M-B -> also avoids R,A,S,E -> but note that M and B are less common than others.
   ""GUILD"": G-U-I-L-D -> avoids R,A,S,E -> but U is a vowel and we already have I, so might be okay.
   ""POINT"": P-O-I-N-T -> avoids R,A,S,E -> O is a vowel, but we can try.

 We want to maximize the chance of hitting the correct letters and also cover more common letters.

 Another idea: ""CHINK"" (but this might be offensive?) ... avoid offensive words.

 Since we are in the second guess, we are still trying to cover ground. We have eliminated four letters (R,A,S,E) and know one (I).

 We have 6 tries total, so we can afford to be a bit more exploratory.

 Let's consider words that use the most common remaining letters: T, N, L, O, C, etc.

 ""OILED"" -> O-I-L-E-D -> but E is eliminated? Wait, we know E is not in the word -> so we cannot use E. And S is eliminated too.

 So ""OILED"" has E -> invalid because E is not in the word? Actually, the feedback says E is not in the word, so we should avoid it. So we cannot use any of R,A,S,E.

 Therefore, we need words without R,A,S,E and with I in the third position.

 Let me list some words without R,A,S,E and with I in the third position:

 - BUILD: B-U-I-L-D -> letters: B, U, I, L, D -> avoids R,A,S,E -> valid.
 - CHILD: C-H-I-L-D -> avoids R,A,S,E -> valid.
 - THING: T-H-I-N-G -> avoids R,A,S,E -> valid.
 - POINT: P-O-I-N-T -> avoids R,A,S,E -> valid.

 Among these, let's choose one that tests new common letters. 

 Since we haven't tested T, N, L, C, etc., ""THING"" covers T, H, N, G. 

 However, note that we also need to consider that the word might have repeated letters? The rules don't say the word can't have repeated letters, but typically Wordle words don't have duplicates. But we haven't been told whether duplicates are allowed. Since the example feedback didn't show any duplicate handling, we'll assume unique letters per word? Actually, in standard Wordle, duplicates are allowed but rare. But to be safe, let's avoid duplicates for now.

 All the words I listed have unique letters.

 Another common word: ""BLIND"" -> B-L-I-N-D -> avoids R,A,S,E -> okay.

 Also, ""MIGHT"": M-I-G-H-T -> but we need I at third position? M-I-G-H-T: the I is at index 1, not 2 -> wrong position. So no.

 We have to have I at the third position.

 Let's go with ""THING"": T-H-I-N-G -> checks T, H, I (already known), N, G.

 I think ""THING"" is a good candidate because:
   It uses common letters T, H, N, G.
   It tests these letters in the positions: 
        T at position 0, H at position 1, N at position 3, G at position 4.

 If the word is ""THING"", we win. But if not, we get feedback on T, H, N, G.

 Alternatively, we could use ""POINT"" to test P, O, N, T? P at 0, O at 1, N at 3, T at 4.

 Or ""GUILT"": G-U-I-L-T -> avoids R,A,S,E -> U is less common, but T is common.

 Let's pick ""THING"" as it uses more common consonants.

 So I'll guess ""THING"".

 But note: we don't have any information about the first letter. It could be T? H? or others.

 Since we only know I at position 2, we are free to try any consonant combination.

 One more consideration: we might want to avoid letters that are less common to maximize information.

 However, ""THING"" seems good.

 Let me check: THING is a valid word.

 Therefore, our next guess is ""THING"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess:
- **R, A, S, E are not in the secret word** (marked as x).
- **I is correct and in position 3** (so the secret word pattern is `_ _ I _ _`).

For the next guess, we need a word that:
- Avoids the letters R, A, S, E.
- Has **I as the third letter**.
- Uses new common letters to gather more clues (e.g., T, H, N, G, L, C).

After considering options like `BUILD`, `CHILD`, and `POINT`, I selected **`THING`** because:
- It fits the pattern `_ _ I _ _` (I is in position 3).
- It avoids forbidden letters (no R, A, S, E).
- It tests high-frequency consonants (T, H, N, G) in critical positions.

<thinking>
Feedback showed:
- Position 3 is confirmed as I (✓).
- We now know R, A, S, E are absent. 
- New guess `THING` tests T at index 0, H at index 1, N at index 3, and G at index 4.

This maximizes information gain:
- If any of T, H, N, or G appear as correct (✓) or misplaced (-), it helps narrow down the word.
- If they're absent (x), we eliminate more letters.

Alternative words (`POINT`, `BUILD`) were viable but `THING`'s letter frequency makes it slightly stronger for this stage.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We have to start with a good first guess. Since it's the first guess, we don't have any information.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize the information we get.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me consider:
 - ""CRANE"": has C, R, A, N, E. It includes common letters and two vowels (A and E).
 - ""SLATE"": has S, L, A, T, E. Also common letters.

 However, note that we are not limited to these.

 Alternatively, let's choose ""ROAST"" as it has R, O, A, S, T. But I recall that ""RAISE"" is also a popular choice because it uses R, A, I, S, E (including vowels and common consonants).

 Another candidate: ""AUDIO"" but that has four vowels and might not cover common consonants as well.

 Considering we might get position info and letter existence, I'll go with ""RAISE"" because:
 - It has two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (R, I, S).
 - R, S, and E are very common letters.

 Therefore, let's guess ""RAISE"".

 But wait, note that the problem says ""valid 5-letter English word"". ""RAISE"" is valid.

 Let me confirm: R-A-I-S-E -> ""raise""

 Since this is the first guess, we are not building on previous feedback.

 So, I'll guess ""RAISE"".<thinking>
For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good starting word typically contains common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to help identify possible matches early.

- Common high-frequency letters in English include R, S, T, L, N, E, and A.
- A balanced mix of vowels and consonants increases the chance of getting useful feedback (✓, -, or x) for multiple positions.

After evaluating common starting words like ""SLATE"", ""CRATE"", and ""ROAST"", I selected ""RAISE"" because:
- It includes three frequently appearing consonants: R, S, and E.
- It contains two vowels: A and I (both common).
- The word ""RAISE"" is frequently used in Wordle strategies for broad coverage.

This guess will provide feedback on:
- Position of R (if ✓ in position 1 or - elsewhere).
- Presence of A, I, S, or E across any positions.

This sets up a strong foundation for narrowing down subsequent guesses.

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(✓) S(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: RAISE -> R(x) A(x) I(✓) S(x) E(x)
 This means:
 - I is in the secret word and in the CORRECT position (index 2, since counting starts at 0: R=0, A=1, I=2, S=3, E=4).
   So the secret word has I as the third letter: _ _ I _ _
 - R, A, S, and E are not in the word at all.

 Since we know the third letter is I, and the word is 5 letters: ? ? I ? ?

 We must avoid using the letters R, A, S, E because they are not in the word.

 For the next guess, we need to pick a valid 5-letter word that:
   - Has 'I' in the third position.
   - Does not contain R, A, S, E.

 Let's think of words ending with I in the third position.

 Since we haven't used many common consonants yet, we might consider including other common letters to test.

 Common consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Let's try to form a word that uses some of the most common remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, etc.

 Possibilities for positions: 
   Position 0: any consonant except R, A, S, E -> let's say T or C or L
   Position 1: similarly, we have many choices
   Position 3 and 4: also any except R, A, S, E.

 We can choose a word that tests several new common letters.

 Example words with I in the third position:
   ""THINK"": T-H-I-N-K -> but we have to check if it avoids R,A,S,E -> yes, it does.
   ""CLIMB"": C-L-I-M-B -> also avoids R,A,S,E -> but note that M and B are less common than others.
   ""GUILD"": G-U-I-L-D -> avoids R,A,S,E -> but U is a vowel and we already have I, so might be okay.
   ""POINT"": P-O-I-N-T -> avoids R,A,S,E -> O is a vowel, but we can try.

 We want to maximize the chance of hitting the correct letters and also cover more common letters.

 Another idea: ""CHINK"" (but this might be offensive?) ... avoid offensive words.

 Since we are in the second guess, we are still trying to cover ground. We have eliminated four letters (R,A,S,E) and know one (I).

 We have 6 tries total, so we can afford to be a bit more exploratory.

 Let's consider words that use the most common remaining letters: T, N, L, O, C, etc.

 ""OILED"" -> O-I-L-E-D -> but E is eliminated? Wait, we know E is not in the word -> so we cannot use E. And S is eliminated too.

 So ""OILED"" has E -> invalid because E is not in the word? Actually, the feedback says E is not in the word, so we should avoid it. So we cannot use any of R,A,S,E.

 Therefore, we need words without R,A,S,E and with I in the third position.

 Let me list some words without R,A,S,E and with I in the third position:

 - BUILD: B-U-I-L-D -> letters: B, U, I, L, D -> avoids R,A,S,E -> valid.
 - CHILD: C-H-I-L-D -> avoids R,A,S,E -> valid.
 - THING: T-H-I-N-G -> avoids R,A,S,E -> valid.
 - POINT: P-O-I-N-T -> avoids R,A,S,E -> valid.

 Among these, let's choose one that tests new common letters. 

 Since we haven't tested T, N, L, C, etc., ""THING"" covers T, H, N, G. 

 However, note that we also need to consider that the word might have repeated letters? The rules don't say the word can't have repeated letters, but typically Wordle words don't have duplicates. But we haven't been told whether duplicates are allowed. Since the example feedback didn't show any duplicate handling, we'll assume unique letters per word? Actually, in standard Wordle, duplicates are allowed but rare. But to be safe, let's avoid duplicates for now.

 All the words I listed have unique letters.

 Another common word: ""BLIND"" -> B-L-I-N-D -> avoids R,A,S,E -> okay.

 Also, ""MIGHT"": M-I-G-H-T -> but we need I at third position? M-I-G-H-T: the I is at index 1, not 2 -> wrong position. So no.

 We have to have I at the third position.

 Let's go with ""THING"": T-H-I-N-G -> checks T, H, I (already known), N, G.

 I think ""THING"" is a good candidate because:
   It uses common letters T, H, N, G.
   It tests these letters in the positions: 
        T at position 0, H at position 1, N at position 3, G at position 4.

 If the word is ""THING"", we win. But if not, we get feedback on T, H, N, G.

 Alternatively, we could use ""POINT"" to test P, O, N, T? P at 0, O at 1, N at 3, T at 4.

 Or ""GUILT"": G-U-I-L-T -> avoids R,A,S,E -> U is less common, but T is common.

 Let's pick ""THING"" as it uses more common consonants.

 So I'll guess ""THING"".

 But note: we don't have any information about the first letter. It could be T? H? or others.

 Since we only know I at position 2, we are free to try any consonant combination.

 One more consideration: we might want to avoid letters that are less common to maximize information.

 However, ""THING"" seems good.

 Let me check: THING is a valid word.

 Therefore, our next guess is ""THING"".Based on the feedback from the first guess:
- **R, A, S, E are not in the secret word** (marked as x).
- **I is correct and in position 3** (so the secret word pattern is `_ _ I _ _`).

For the next guess, we need a word that:
- Avoids the letters R, A, S, E.
- Has **I as the third letter**.
- Uses new common letters to gather more clues (e.g., T, H, N, G, L, C).

After considering options like `BUILD`, `CHILD`, and `POINT`, I selected **`THING`** because:
- It fits the pattern `_ _ I _ _` (I is in position 3).
- It avoids forbidden letters (no R, A, S, E).
- It tests high-frequency consonants (T, H, N, G) in critical positions.

<thinking>
Feedback showed:
- Position 3 is confirmed as I (✓).
- We now know R, A, S, E are absent. 
- New guess `THING` tests T at index 0, H at index 1, N at index 3, and G at index 4.

This maximizes information gain:
- If any of T, H, N, or G appear as correct (✓) or misplaced (-), it helps narrow down the word.
- If they're absent (x), we eliminate more letters.

Alternative words (`POINT`, `BUILD`) were viable but `THING`'s letter frequency makes it slightly stronger for this stage.

We are given feedback:
 Guess 1: RAISE -> R(x) A(x) I(✓) S(x) E(x) → So I is in the word at position 2 (0-indexed), and R, A, S, E are absent.
 Guess 2: THING -> T(✓) H(x) I(✓) N(✓) G(✓) → This means:
   T is correct at position 0 → so the word starts with T.
   H is absent (x) → meaning H is not in the word.
   I is correct at position 2 (as before).
   N is correct at position 3.
   G is correct at position 4.

 Therefore, the secret word is: T _ I N G, i.e., the pattern is T?ING, with the third letter being I and the last two fixed as N and G.

 Now, we know that the word is of the form T _ I N G.

 We also know that H is absent (from the second guess) and R, A, S, E are absent (from the first guess).

 We need to fill the blank (position 1). What letter can go there?

 We must avoid the letters: R, A, S, E, H (and any others we've eliminated).

 We have used: R, A, I, S, E, T, H, N, G. So eliminated: R, A, S, E, H.

 We know that the word is T?ING, and the missing letter is in position 1.

 Possible words: Let's think of 5-letter words ending in ""ING"" that start with T and have a third letter I (so the pattern is T_ING).

 Common words:
   ""THING"" we tried, but H is absent -> not ""THING"".
   ""TYING"": T-Y-I-N-G -> but Y is not eliminated? Check: 
        Letters: T (0:✓), Y, I(2:✓), N(3:✓), G(4:✓). 
        We haven't checked Y yet. But we eliminated H, but Y is okay? And feedback may show if Y is present.
   ""TWING"" is not a word? 
   ""TRING"" not a word.
   ""TAING"" not a word.

 What about less common? ""TOING"" is not standard. 

 Let me list valid English words matching T?ING:
   - ""TYING"": valid, meaning to fasten with string.
   - There's also ""TICING"" but that has C and C hasn't been eliminated? But note: we have fixed I at position 2? Actually, the pattern requires position 2 to be I, so ""TICING"" is T-I-C-I-N-G? Wait, no: T-I-C-I-N-G is 6 letters? So not 5.

 Actually, ""TICING"" is 6 letters.

 We need 5-letter words: T_ING -> the blank must be one letter.

 Other options: 
   - ""TRUING"" is 6 letters.
   - ""TWIING""? Not valid.

 How about:
   - ""TYING"" seems the most common. 
   - ""THING"" we know is not because H is absent.

 Is there ""TPING""? No.

 What about ""FLING"", but that starts with F. We need T at start.

 Another possibility: ""DYING"" but doesn't start with T.

 So, we must consider that the word might be ""TYING"".

 But let's check: we haven't used Y yet. And we don't know if Y is in the word or not.

 Alternatively, are there other words? 

 Actually, let me think: 
   - ""BEING"" -> starts with B.
   - ""FLING"", ""CLING"", ""SLING"", ""STING"", ""WING"" (too short) etc., none start with T.

 Wait, ""STING"" -> S is already eliminated (from guess1). So we cannot have S.

 Another word: ""TYING"" is the only common word I can think of.

 But what about ""DOING""? Doesn't start with T.

 Therefore, with the information we have, ""TYING"" is the prime candidate.

 However, note: we already know that G (from guess2) is at the end. And N at position 3.

 So the word must be T?I N G -> five letters: T, ?, I, N, G.

 And the only common English word that fits that pattern with ? not eliminated (and avoiding R,A,S,E,H) is ""TYING"".

 Therefore, I'll guess ""TYING"".

 Let me confirm: T-Y-I-N-G -> letters: T, Y, I, N, G.
   We know T, I, N, G are correct and fixed at their positions? So if Y is the missing letter, then we'll get T(✓), Y(?) at position 1, I(✓), N(✓), G(✓). Since Y is new, we'll see the feedback.

 Alternatively, if Y is not in the word (or misplaced) then we might get a '-' or 'x' for Y. But note: Y must be in the word at position 1? Actually, the word pattern is T?ING, so if Y is not correct then we have no word? 

 Wait, we must consider that there might be other words. But from what we know, ""TYING"" seems the most plausible.

 Also note: we have only 6 tries, and we are on guess 3. We can try ""TYING"".

 If it's wrong, we might get feedback that helps us find the next one.

 But let me double-check: are there any other words?

 Example: ""TAMING"" -> has A, but A is eliminated. 
   ""TELLING"" is 6 letters? 
   ""TILING"" -> T-I-L-I-N-G? But that would be 6 letters? Or T-I-L-I-N-G? Actually, ""TILING"" is 6 letters. 

 Wait, ""TILING"" can be considered as 6? But actually, we are looking for 5-letter: T?ING -> must have exactly 5 letters.

 Another word: ""TIMING"" -> T-I-M-I-N-G -> 6 letters? No, ""TIMING"" is 5 letters? T-I-M-I-N-G? No, T-I-M-I-N-G is 5? Wait: 
   T-I-M-I-N-G: that's 6 letters? 
   Actually, ""TIMING"": T(1), I(2), M(3), I(4), N(5), G(6)? Wait, no: 
      Position 0: T
      Position 1: I -> but we need a letter for position 1? And then position 2 must be I? Actually, ""TIMING"" has I at position 1 and then M at position 2? So pattern is T-I-M-I-N-G? That's 6 characters? 

 Let me count: T, I, M, I, N, G -> that's 6 letters? Actually:

   T-I-M-I-N-G: that's 6. 

 So we need a 5-letter word. The pattern we have is: 
   Position0: T
   Position1: unknown
   Position2: I
   Position3: N
   Position4: G

 Therefore, 5 letters.

 Other possibilities? 
   - ""THING"" is eliminated. 
   - ""TYING"" is one.
   - ""TOING"" might be a rare word? Not common.

 Or maybe ""TUING"" which is not a word.

 Therefore, we must guess ""TYING"".

 So let's go with that. 

 Also, note that we might have missed a word? 

 Another word: ""TWING"" is not valid. 

 How about ""BLING"", but doesn't start with T.

 So, given the constraints, I think ""TYING"" is the best bet.

 Moreover, we haven't tested Y yet, so we need to know if Y is part of the word.

 Therefore, our guess is ""TYING"".

  - **T(✓)** correct in position 0 → secret word starts with T.
  - **H(x)** absent → H is not in the word.
  - **I(✓)** confirmed again in position 2.
  - **N(✓)** correct in position 3.
  - **G(✓)** correct in position 4.

The secret word pattern is **T _ I N G** (position 1 is unknown), and we know:
- Excluded letters: **R, A, S, E, H**.
- Position 1 must be filled with a letter not yet eliminated (avoiding R, A, S, E, H).

After evaluating possibilities:
- Common words fitting ""T?ING"" are limited since ""THING"" was tested and rejected (H absent).
- **TYING** (T-Y-I-N-G) is the most common valid English word matching the pattern and avoiding excluded letters.
- It introduces Y (untested letter) and fits all constraints.

If ""TYING"" is correct, we win. If not, feedback on Y will provide critical clues for the next guess (e.g., if Y is misplaced or absent).

<thinking>
Feedback constraints:
- Secret word = T_ING (positions: T fixed at 0, unknown at 1, I at 2, N at 3, G at 4).
- Eliminated letters: R, A, S, E, H → position 1 must be a letter outside this set.
- Y is a plausible candidate (e.g., ""tying"" means fastening with cord).

No other common 5-letter ""T?ING"" words exist that use only allowed letters:
- ""THING"" (invalid: H absent).
- ""TRING"", ""TWING"", ""TOING"" are not valid words.
- Other options like ""TAMING"" or ""TIMING"" exceed the letter count or violate constraints.

<guess>TYING</guess>",TYING,"We are given feedback:
 Guess 1: RAISE -> R(x) A(x) I(✓) S(x) E(x) → So I is in the word at position 2 (0-indexed), and R, A, S, E are absent.
 Guess 2: THING -> T(✓) H(x) I(✓) N(✓) G(✓) → This means:
   T is correct at position 0 → so the word starts with T.
   H is absent (x) → meaning H is not in the word.
   I is correct at position 2 (as before).
   N is correct at position 3.
   G is correct at position 4.

 Therefore, the secret word is: T _ I N G, i.e., the pattern is T?ING, with the third letter being I and the last two fixed as N and G.

 Now, we know that the word is of the form T _ I N G.

 We also know that H is absent (from the second guess) and R, A, S, E are absent (from the first guess).

 We need to fill the blank (position 1). What letter can go there?

 We must avoid the letters: R, A, S, E, H (and any others we've eliminated).

 We have used: R, A, I, S, E, T, H, N, G. So eliminated: R, A, S, E, H.

 We know that the word is T?ING, and the missing letter is in position 1.

 Possible words: Let's think of 5-letter words ending in ""ING"" that start with T and have a third letter I (so the pattern is T_ING).

 Common words:
   ""THING"" we tried, but H is absent -> not ""THING"".
   ""TYING"": T-Y-I-N-G -> but Y is not eliminated? Check: 
        Letters: T (0:✓), Y, I(2:✓), N(3:✓), G(4:✓). 
        We haven't checked Y yet. But we eliminated H, but Y is okay? And feedback may show if Y is present.
   ""TWING"" is not a word? 
   ""TRING"" not a word.
   ""TAING"" not a word.

 What about less common? ""TOING"" is not standard. 

 Let me list valid English words matching T?ING:
   - ""TYING"": valid, meaning to fasten with string.
   - There's also ""TICING"" but that has C and C hasn't been eliminated? But note: we have fixed I at position 2? Actually, the pattern requires position 2 to be I, so ""TICING"" is T-I-C-I-N-G? Wait, no: T-I-C-I-N-G is 6 letters? So not 5.

 Actually, ""TICING"" is 6 letters.

 We need 5-letter words: T_ING -> the blank must be one letter.

 Other options: 
   - ""TRUING"" is 6 letters.
   - ""TWIING""? Not valid.

 How about:
   - ""TYING"" seems the most common. 
   - ""THING"" we know is not because H is absent.

 Is there ""TPING""? No.

 What about ""FLING"", but that starts with F. We need T at start.

 Another possibility: ""DYING"" but doesn't start with T.

 So, we must consider that the word might be ""TYING"".

 But let's check: we haven't used Y yet. And we don't know if Y is in the word or not.

 Alternatively, are there other words? 

 Actually, let me think: 
   - ""BEING"" -> starts with B.
   - ""FLING"", ""CLING"", ""SLING"", ""STING"", ""WING"" (too short) etc., none start with T.

 Wait, ""STING"" -> S is already eliminated (from guess1). So we cannot have S.

 Another word: ""TYING"" is the only common word I can think of.

 But what about ""DOING""? Doesn't start with T.

 Therefore, with the information we have, ""TYING"" is the prime candidate.

 However, note: we already know that G (from guess2) is at the end. And N at position 3.

 So the word must be T?I N G -> five letters: T, ?, I, N, G.

 And the only common English word that fits that pattern with ? not eliminated (and avoiding R,A,S,E,H) is ""TYING"".

 Therefore, I'll guess ""TYING"".

 Let me confirm: T-Y-I-N-G -> letters: T, Y, I, N, G.
   We know T, I, N, G are correct and fixed at their positions? So if Y is the missing letter, then we'll get T(✓), Y(?) at position 1, I(✓), N(✓), G(✓). Since Y is new, we'll see the feedback.

 Alternatively, if Y is not in the word (or misplaced) then we might get a '-' or 'x' for Y. But note: Y must be in the word at position 1? Actually, the word pattern is T?ING, so if Y is not correct then we have no word? 

 Wait, we must consider that there might be other words. But from what we know, ""TYING"" seems the most plausible.

 Also note: we have only 6 tries, and we are on guess 3. We can try ""TYING"".

 If it's wrong, we might get feedback that helps us find the next one.

 But let me double-check: are there any other words?

 Example: ""TAMING"" -> has A, but A is eliminated. 
   ""TELLING"" is 6 letters? 
   ""TILING"" -> T-I-L-I-N-G? But that would be 6 letters? Or T-I-L-I-N-G? Actually, ""TILING"" is 6 letters. 

 Wait, ""TILING"" can be considered as 6? But actually, we are looking for 5-letter: T?ING -> must have exactly 5 letters.

 Another word: ""TIMING"" -> T-I-M-I-N-G -> 6 letters? No, ""TIMING"" is 5 letters? T-I-M-I-N-G? No, T-I-M-I-N-G is 5? Wait: 
   T-I-M-I-N-G: that's 6 letters? 
   Actually, ""TIMING"": T(1), I(2), M(3), I(4), N(5), G(6)? Wait, no: 
      Position 0: T
      Position 1: I -> but we need a letter for position 1? And then position 2 must be I? Actually, ""TIMING"" has I at position 1 and then M at position 2? So pattern is T-I-M-I-N-G? That's 6 characters? 

 Let me count: T, I, M, I, N, G -> that's 6 letters? Actually:

   T-I-M-I-N-G: that's 6. 

 So we need a 5-letter word. The pattern we have is: 
   Position0: T
   Position1: unknown
   Position2: I
   Position3: N
   Position4: G

 Therefore, 5 letters.

 Other possibilities? 
   - ""THING"" is eliminated. 
   - ""TYING"" is one.
   - ""TOING"" might be a rare word? Not common.

 Or maybe ""TUING"" which is not a word.

 Therefore, we must guess ""TYING"".

 So let's go with that. 

 Also, note that we might have missed a word? 

 Another word: ""TWING"" is not valid. 

 How about ""BLING"", but doesn't start with T.

 So, given the constraints, I think ""TYING"" is the best bet.

 Moreover, we haven't tested Y yet, so we need to know if Y is part of the word.

 Therefore, our guess is ""TYING"".Based on the feedback:
- **First Guess (RAISE)**: Eliminated letters: R, A, S, E (not in the word). Confirmed **I** in position 3 (0-indexed position 2).
- **Second Guess (THING)**: 
  - **T(✓)** correct in position 0 → secret word starts with T.
  - **H(x)** absent → H is not in the word.
  - **I(✓)** confirmed again in position 2.
  - **N(✓)** correct in position 3.
  - **G(✓)** correct in position 4.

The secret word pattern is **T _ I N G** (position 1 is unknown), and we know:
- Excluded letters: **R, A, S, E, H**.
- Position 1 must be filled with a letter not yet eliminated (avoiding R, A, S, E, H).

After evaluating possibilities:
- Common words fitting ""T?ING"" are limited since ""THING"" was tested and rejected (H absent).
- **TYING** (T-Y-I-N-G) is the most common valid English word matching the pattern and avoiding excluded letters.
- It introduces Y (untested letter) and fits all constraints.

If ""TYING"" is correct, we win. If not, feedback on Y will provide critical clues for the next guess (e.g., if Y is misplaced or absent).
