We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C(x) -> C is not in the secret word.
 R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.
 A(x) -> A is not in the secret word.
 N(x) -> N is not in the secret word.
 E(-) -> E is in the word but in the wrong position.

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letter E, but not in the last position (since in ""crane"", E was at position 5 and it was wrong).
 - The letters C, R, A, N are all absent from the secret word.

 Therefore, we need to choose a new word that:
 1. Includes E (since it's present) but not at the end (position 5).
 2. Does not contain C, R, A, N.
 3. Should try to test other common letters to get more information.

 Let's list some common letters that aren't used yet: S, T, O, I, L, D, U, M, P, etc.

 Since E is present but not in position 5, we can try placing E in different positions.
 We also want to avoid positions where we know it might not be, but since we only know it's not at position 5, it could be in positions 1,2,3,4.

 Considering the above, let's think of words that:
 - Have E in one of the positions 1-4.
 - Are made of letters that are common and haven't been eliminated.

 Possible candidates:
 - Words starting with E: like ""E"" followed by other letters? But we don't know the other letters.

 Alternatively, we can pick a word that has E and other common letters.

 Since we have eliminated C, R, A, N, let's avoid those.

 Let me think of words without C, R, A, N and with E in either position 1,2,3,4.

 Example words:
 Position 1: E _ _ _ _
   e.g., ""EIGHT"" -> but that has G,H,T. Also, E at position 1.

 However, note: the secret word has E somewhere (not position 5) but we don't know where. It could be position 1,2,3, or 4.

 But in ""crane"", E was at position 5 and was marked as '-', meaning it is in the word but not at position 5. That does not preclude E from being at position 5 in other words? Actually, no: the same word cannot have two E's? Wait, the secret word might have two E's? But we don't know.

 However, the feedback only tells us that at least one E is present, but not at the position we guessed. It doesn't say anything about other positions.

 Since we guessed only one E and the secret word has an E that is not at position 5, it must have E in one of positions 1-4.

 Now, for the next guess, we can try to cover more common letters.

 I propose: ""LOUSE""
 Why?
 L, O, U, S, E -> E is at position 5? Wait, we want to avoid position 5 because in the previous word E was at position 5 and was incorrect? But note: the feedback said E is present but not at position 5. It doesn't mean that in a different word we cannot put E at position 5? Actually, the secret word must have E somewhere in positions 1-4. So if we put E at position 5 again, we might get the same feedback? However, if the word has an E at position 5 and also an E elsewhere, then we would get two marks? But we don't know if it has multiple E's.

 But to be safe, we shouldn't put E at position 5 again because we know it's not at position 5. However, if the word has two E's, then placing E at position 5 will still show as not correct? But the feedback would then say '-' if there is another E? Actually, no: the marking is per letter and may be ambiguous? Let me clarify the rules: typically, each feedback symbol corresponds to the letter in that position. And for duplicate letters, it can be tricky: if the secret word has one E and you have two E's, one might be marked as absent.

 To keep it simple, let's avoid putting E at position 5 again because we already know that position 5 is not E. So we can place E in positions 1,2,3,4.

 Let me change: instead of ""LOUSE"", I can use ""POSE"" but that's 4 letters? No, 5 letters.

 Alternatives: let's pick a word with E in the middle.

 How about ""PLUME""? But that has E at position 5 -> avoid position 5.

 Let's pick a word with E at position 4? Like ""TIMES"" -> T,I,M,E,S. But we don't know if these letters are present.

 Another idea: words with E at position 1: ""EDGES"" -> but E at position 1 and 5? We avoid position 5, but we can get feedback on E at position 1? However, we don't want to reuse E at position 5? Actually, we can try to avoid the known wrong position.

 Better: try a word with E at position 2,3,4.

 Options:
 ""BELOW"" -> B,E,L,O,W: E at position 2. But we don't know if B,L,O,W are in the word? And we avoid C,R,A,N -> B,L,O,W are new.

 Or: ""SEIZE"" -> S,E,I,Z,E -> but has E at positions 2 and 5. We don't want E at position 5 -> so that might not be good.

 Another idea: ""NOISE""? But N is eliminated -> wait, our first guess had N and it was absent, so no N.

 We must avoid N.

 So, let's try: ""POISE"" -> P,O,I,S,E -> E at position 5 -> avoid.

 How about ""BIKES""? B,I,K,E,S -> E at position 4? That works.

 But we haven't used many common consonants? Maybe S and T are good.

 Alternate: ""TILES"" -> T,I,L,E,S -> E at position 4? And avoids C,R,A,N.

 But note: the word must be a valid English word.

 Another common word: ""TIMES"" -> T,I,M,E,S -> E at position 4.

 Or: ""DUKES"" -> D,U,K,E,S -> E at position 4.

 But let me pick a word that uses common letters and without E at position 5.

 I think ""TIMES"" is a good candidate? But we don't know if T,I,M are in the word.

 Alternatively, we can choose ""SLEPT"": S,L,E,P,T -> E at position 3? That has E at position 3, avoids position 5, and uses S,L,P,T which are common and not eliminated.

 Also, avoids C,R,A,N.

 So, I'll go with ""SLEPT"".

 Let me write:

 Guess: slept -> S, L, E, P, T

 We'll get feedback on these letters.

 But note: we know E is in the word but not at position 5, and in this guess it's at position 3, so if E is at position 3 in the secret word, we'll get a check, otherwise a dash.

 However, we are also testing S, L, P, T.

 This seems like a good choice.

 So, second guess: ""slept""

 If I think of other words: ""POLED"" -> we don't know D, and O,L,D,P -> but L is common? Actually, ""poled"" is a word? It means propelled a boat with a pole.

 But let me stick to common words: ""SLEPT"" is very common.

 Done.

Based on the previous feedback:
- C, R, A, N are **absent** from the secret word.
- E is **present** but not in position 5 (since ""crane"" had E at the end).

I need a new guess that:
1. Avoids C, R, A, N.
2. Includes E (but not in position 5).
3. Tests new common letters to gather more information.

I chose **SLEPT** because:
- E is in position 3 (avoiding the known wrong position).
- Uses common letters S, L, P, T that weren't tested before.
- It's a valid English word and fits all constraints.

 ""BELOW"" -> B,E,L,O,W: E at position 2. But we don't know if B,L,O,W are in the word? And we avoid C,R,A,N -> B,L,O,W are new.

 Or: ""SEIZE"" -> S,E,I,Z,E -> but has E at positions 2 and 5. We don't want E at position 5 -> so that might not be good.

 Another idea: ""NOISE""? But N is eliminated -> wait, our first guess had N and it was absent, so no N.

 We must avoid N.

 So, let's try: ""POISE"" -> P,O,I,S,E -> E at position 5 -> avoid.

 How about ""BIKES""? B,I,K,E,S -> E at position 4? That works.

 But we haven't used many common consonants? Maybe S and T are good.

 Alternate: ""TILES"" -> T,I,L,E,S -> E at position 4? And avoids C,R,A,N.

 But note: the word must be a valid English word.

 Another common word: ""TIMES"" -> T,I,M,E,S -> E at position 4.

 Or: ""DUKES"" -> D,U,K,E,S -> E at position 4.

 But let me pick a word that uses common letters and without E at position 5.

 I think ""TIMES"" is a good candidate? But we don't know if T,I,M are in the word.

 Alternatively, we can choose ""SLEPT"": S,L,E,P,T -> E at position 3? That has E at position 3, avoids position 5, and uses S,L,P,T which are common and not eliminated.

 Also, avoids C,R,A,N.

 So, I'll go with ""SLEPT"".

 Let me write:

 Guess: slept -> S, L, E, P, T

 We'll get feedback on these letters.

 But note: we know E is in the word but not at position 5, and in this guess it's at position 3, so if E is at position 3 in the secret word, we'll get a check, otherwise a dash.

 However, we are also testing S, L, P, T.

 This seems like a good choice.

 So, second guess: ""slept""

 If I think of other words: ""POLED"" -> we don't know D, and O,L,D,P -> but L is common? Actually, ""poled"" is a word? It means propelled a boat with a pole.

 But let me stick to common words: ""SLEPT"" is very common.

 Done.

<guess>slept</guess>Based on the previous feedback:
- C, R, A, N are **absent** from the secret word.
- E is **present** but not in position 5 (since ""crane"" had E at the end).

I need a new guess that:
1. Avoids C, R, A, N.
2. Includes E (but not in position 5).
3. Tests new common letters to gather more information.

I chose **SLEPT** because:
- E is in position 3 (avoiding the known wrong position).
- Uses common letters S, L, P, T that weren't tested before.
- It's a valid English word and fits all constraints.

But we don\'t know the other letters.\n\n Alternatively, we can pick a word that has E and other common letters.\n\n Since we have eliminated C, R, A, N, let\'s avoid those.\n\n Let me think of words without C, R, A, N and with E in either position 1,2,3,4.\n\n Example words:\n Position 1: E _ _ _ _\n   e.g., ""EIGHT"" -> but that has G,H,T.

That does not preclude E from being at position 5 in other words? Actually, no: the same word cannot have two E\'s? Wait, the secret word might have two E\'s? But we don\'t know.\n\n However, the feedback only tells us that at least one E is present, but not at the position we guessed. It doesn\'t say anything about other positions.\n\n Since we guessed only one E and the secret word has an E that is not at position 5, it must have E in one of positions 1-4.\n\n Now, for the next guess, we can try to cover more common letters.\n\n I propose: ""LOUSE""\n Why?\n L, O, U, S, E -> E is at position 5? Wait, we want to avoid position 5 because in the previous word E was at position 5 and was incorrect? But note: the feedback said E is present but not at position 5. It doesn\'t mean that in a different word we cannot put E at position 5? Actually, the secret word must have E somewhere in positions 1-4. So if we put E at position 5 again, we might get the same feedback? However, if the word has an E at position 5 and also an E elsewhere, then we would get two marks? But we don\'t know if it has multiple E\'s.\n\n But to be safe, we shouldn\'t put E at position 5 again because we know it\'s not at position 5. However, if the word has two E\'s, then placing E at position 5 will still show as not correct? But the feedback would then say \'-\' if there is another E? Actually, no: the marking is per letter and may be ambiguous? Let me clarify the rules: typically, each feedback symbol corresponds to the letter in that position. And for duplicate letters, it can be tricky: if the secret word has one E and you have two E\'s, one might be marked as absent.\n\n To keep it simple, let\'s avoid putting E at position 5 again because we already know that position 5 is not E. So we can place E in positions 1,2,3,4.\n\n Let me change: instead of ""LOUSE"", I can use ""POSE"" but that\'s 4 letters? No, 5 letters.\n\n Alternatives: let\'s pick a word with E in the middle.\n\n How about ""PLUME""? But that has E at position 5 -> avoid position 5.\n\n Let\'s pick a word with E at position 4?

We have feedback from two guesses:

From Guess 1 (""crane""):
- C(x): C not in word
- R(x): R not in word
- A(x): A not in word
- N(x): N not in word
- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 5

From Guess 2 (""slept""):
- S(x): S not in word
- L(-): L is in the word but not in position 2 (since in ""slept"", L was at position 2)
- E(✓): E is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, because in ""slept"", E is the third letter)
- P(-): P is in the word but not in position 4
- T(x): T not in word

So, what we know:
- Secret word contains: E (specifically at position 3), L, and P.
- E is fixed at position 3 (because we have a ✓).
- L is in the word but not at position 2.
- P is in the word but not at position 4.
- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, T (from both guesses, all marked x).

Additionally, we have E present and at position 3.

Let me list the knowns:
- Position 3: E (correct and fixed)

Known presents: E (fixed at 3), L (somewhere, not 2), P (somewhere, not 4)

Absent: C, R, A, N, S, T

Now, the secret word has 5 letters: _ _ E _ _

We know L and P must be in the word, but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively? Actually:
- L is in the word, but it was in position 2 in ""slept"" and that was wrong, so L cannot be at position 2. But it can be at positions 1,4, or 5? (since E is at 3)
- Similarly, P was at position 4 in ""slept"" and that was wrong, so P cannot be at position 4. It can be at positions 1,2,5.

Moreover, the secret word must have exactly three of the letters known (E, L, P) plus two more letters we haven't guessed yet? Or duplicate letters? But at least E, L, P are present.

But note: we don't know if there are duplicates. But we haven't seen any duplicates so far.

Now, for the next guess, we need to:
- Find a 5-letter word that has E at position 3 (since we know it's correct).
- Contains L and P (because they are present).
- Does NOT contain any of the absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, T.
- Also, we must consider the positions: L not at position 2, P not at position 4.

Moreover, since E is fixed at position 3, we only need to guess the other positions.

The word must be: positions 1,2,4,5 are unknown, but we must include L and P somewhere, with constraints.

We need to test for the remaining positions and find other letters.

But note: we have only 6 tries, so we should try to cover new common letters.

Common remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, U, V, W, Y, etc.

I need to choose a word with E at position 3, and includes L and P, avoiding absent letters.

Let me try to brainstorm words with the pattern: _ _ E _ _

And containing L and P.

Since L and P can be in various positions.

Possible positions:
- L can be in positions 1,4,5 (not 2)
- P can be in positions 1,2,5 (not 4)

But positions 1,2,4,5 are available for L and P and two other letters.

Since the secret word must have L and P, we need to fill two more positions with letters that are not known absent.

Let me try to think of common words that fit the constraints:

- Position 3 must be E: so words ending in EL? e.g., MODEL, BUT MODEL has D and L? Pattern: _ _ E L? But we need to have P too. Model has M,O,D,E,L -> five letters? MODEL: positions? 
  Position: M(1), O(2), D(3)? Wait, no, we need position 3 to be E. So not MODEL.

Words with E at position 3: third letter E.

Examples:
- BEGIN -> but G,I,N: N is absent? We cannot use N.
- BEVEL -> B,E,V,E,L -> has E at position 3? Position1: B, Pos2: E? But we need third letter E: BEVEL: B(1), E(2), V(3)? Not at 3.

I need words where the third letter is E.

Common ones: like GREEN? But G,R,E,E,N: has R and N - absent! Not allowed.

Another: FLYER? F(1), L(2), Y(3) -> not E.

Better list: 
APPLE? A(1), P(2), P(3) -> not E.

How about words like: 

- ""BLEEP"": B(1), L(2), E(3), E(4), P(5) -> pattern: positions: E at 3. But note: L is at position 2? But remember, in our constraints, L cannot be at position 2 because in ""slept"" L was at position 2 and it was wrong? So BLEEP has L at position 2? Not allowed? Actually, we don't know if position 2 is excluded for L? Yes, because in ""slept"", we had S,L,E,P,T and L was marked as '-' meaning L is in the word but not at position 2. So if we put L at position 2 again, it would be wrong again? So we should avoid position 2 for L.

Therefore, BLEEP is invalid because L is at position 2.

Similarly, ""PLEAD"": P(1), L(2), E(3), A(4), D(5) -> but L at position 2? Avoid position 2 for L, so not PLEAD. And A is absent? A is absent from the secret word? Yes, because first guess had A and it was marked absent.

We need words without placing L at position 2.

But we need L somewhere else.

How about L at position 1? Like ""LEPER"": L(1), E(2), P(3) -> but we need E at position 3? This has E at position 2? No, not matching.

Words with E at position 3 and L and P:

Hmm... consider: 

- ""HELPS"": H(1), E(2), L(3) -> L is at position 3? But we need E at position 3.

Not HELPS.

What about ""KELP"": only 4 letters.

5-letter words: 
- ""EXPEL"": E(1), X(2), P(3), E(4), L(5) -> has E at position 3? Positions: E(1), X(2), P(3), E(4), L(5). Position 3 is P, not E? No.

How about ""IMPEL"": I(1), M(2), P(3), E(4), L(5) -> position 4 is E? Not at position 3.

Now, E at position 3:

I recall words like:
- QUEEN: Q(1),U(2),E(3),E(4),N(5) -> N absent? Invalid.

- GREEN: G(1),R(2),E(3),E(4),N(5) -> R and N absent? R is absent? Yes, from first guess.

- FLEET: F(1),L(2),E(3),E(4),T(5) -> T is absent? From guess 2, T was marked absent? Yes. Also L at position 2: which we must avoid because we know L is not at position 2.

- SHEET: S and T absent? S and T are absent? Yes. 

Another: ""BLEEP"": as before, L at position 2? Avoid.

Perhaps put L at position 4 or 5?

How about: 

- ""DUPLE"": not common, and only 5 letters? D,U,P,L,E -> Pattern: D(1),U(2),P(3),L(4),E(5) -> position 3 is P? Not E.

We need position 3 to be E.

So, let's think of words like ...E...

With E at third slot.

For example: 
- WHALE: W(1), H(2), A(3) -> no.

Another: ""CREPT"": C and R absent? Yes.

Try without A, R, N, C, S, T.

Word must be: positions 1,2,3=E (fixed),4,5.

But position 3 is E? No, position 3 is fixed E, so word pattern: ABECD? Where A,B (position1,2), E(3), C(position4), D(position5).

But C,D are letters.

How about ""LIBEL"": L(1),I(2),B(3)? But position 3 must be E? Not B.

Not LIBEL.

Try: ""IMPEL"": wrong, E not at 3.

"" UPPER "": U(1),P(2),P(3),E(4),R(5) -> has P and ... no E at 3.

I need to use a dictionary? Since I'm thinking, I must recall English words.

Maybe ""AMPLE""? A(1),M(2),P(3) -> position 3 is P? Not E.

Another idea: ""ELOPE"": E(1),L(2),O(3),P(4),E(5) -> position 3 is O? Not E.

But we need position 3 to be E.

Possible words: 

- ""HOMED"": H(1),O(2),M(3) -> no.

Let me think phonetically: 

- Some 5-letter words: BEVEL (B,E,V,E,L) -> positions: B1, E2, V3 -> not E at 3.

Not BEVEL.

- ""LEVEL"": L1,E2,V3 -> V at 3? No.

- ""REVEL"": R1,E2,E3,V4,L5? R is absent? Yes, R was marked absent in guess 1.

Remove letters that are absent.

Letters allowed: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,M,O,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (and etc., missing the absent ones: C,R,A,N,S,T)

Now, word must include L and P.

Pattern: [ position1: any allowed ] [ position2: not L and any allowed ] [ position3: E ] [ position4: not P and any allowed ] [ position5 ]

Let me think... 

Perhaps ""MAPLE"": M1,A2,P3,L4,E5 -> position 3 is P? Not E, and also A absent.

Not ""MAPLE"".

How about ""LUPUS"": no E.

Idea: include E at position 3:

""QUELL"": Q1,U2,E3,L4,L5? -> but only 4 letters? Que l l is 4? Wait: QUELL is 5: Q,U,E,L,L.

Pattern: Q1,U2,E3,L4,L5 -> position 3 E. Also, includes L at positions 4 and 5? But we need to include P? This doesn't have P? We must have P in the word? Yes.

QUELL lacks P.

But has E at position 3: good.

But no P.

We need a word with E at position 3, and L and P both.

OK, another word: ""PELTS"": P1,E2,L3,T4,S5 -> position 3 L? Not E, and S,T absent? Double absent.

Not good.

""EXPEL"": E1,X2,P3,E4,L5 -> position 3 P? Not E.

""DELVE"": D1,E2,L3,V4,E5 -> position 3 L? Not E.

Perhaps ""PIXEL"": P1,I2,X3,E4,L5 -> no E at position 3.

How about ""FILLET"" is 6 letters.

Another: ""POUFE"" but not common.

Maybe ""OILED"": O1,I2,L3,E4,D5 -> position 3 L? Not E.

The closest I can think is ""BELLE"": B1,E2,L3,L4,E5? Position 3 L? Not E for position 3, and E at position 2? No.

Perhaps ""DWEEB"" not common.

I might be missing common words.

Let me search: words with third letter E and containing L and P.

For example: ""P E L E C"" but not English.

Perhaps the word ""AMPLE"" doesn't have E at 3.

Another: ""PEACE"" has C? Absent.

""PLEDGE"" is 6 letters.

""PLEBE"" is 5 letters: P1,L2,E3,B4,E5? This has E at position 3! And L at position 2.

PLEBE: P, L, E, B, E -> pattern: position1: P, position2: L, position3: E, position4: B, position5: E.

But now, is this valid? We have L at position 2. But previous feedback said L is not at position 2? Because in ""slept"" L was at position 2 and it was marked '-', meaning L is in the word but not at position 2. Therefore, positioning L at position 2 again would be incorrect. So PLEBE has L at position 2, so it would give a '-' for L at position 2 again? But we want to find the secret word. We must avoid placing L at position 2.

Therefore, PLEBE is not allowed since L must not be at position 2.

So what words have E at position 3 and include L and P without positioning L at position 2 or P at position 4?

How about placing L at position 1 or 4 or 5, and P at position 1,2,5.

For example:
- L at position 4:
  Word like a b e l p? But that would be ... E then L? But p must be somewhere.

Let's try ""HIPPO"": no E.

Perhaps ""CREEK"" has C? Absent.

I think of ""BLEEP"" but L at 2, not allowed.

Wait, another word: ""ELITE"" has no P? No.

""BELCH"" has L at 4? B1,E2,L3,C4,H5? Position 3 l? Not E.

Perhaps we can use a word that doesn't have L at 2 or P at 4.

For example, L at position 1: then the first letter L, second letter ?, third E, then ? and P.

Pattern: L _, E, _, _

Or L at position 4: _, _, E, L, _

Or L at position 5: _, _, E, _, L

And P similarly: P can be at 1,2,5.

So possible:

If L at position 1: L?EP? no, must be L?E? but then position 4 and 5, one of which must be P? Or position 2 can be P.

Position 2 can have P because P can be at 2.

For example: word starting with L, then P? LPE?? 

Like 'L PEP'? Not word.

But let me list actual words:

For example, ""LUPUS"": no E.

Another: ""LAPSE"": L1,A2,P3,S4,E5 -> but position 3 P? Not E, and S,T absent? Also A absent.

Not good.

Perhaps L at position 4: then pattern: ? ? E L ?

And P must be in position 1 or 2 or 5.

Example: ""JEWEL"": J1,E2,W3,E4,L5 -> position 3 W? Not E.

""COPSE"": C absent? and position 3 P, no.

""BUGLE"": B1,U2,G3,E4,L5 -> position 3 G? Not E.

But position 4 is E? Not position 3.

Perhaps "" Fable "" F1,A2,B3,L4,E5 -> absent A? and position 3 not E.

I'm struggling.

Another idea: the word ""PILED"": P1,I2,L3,E4,D5 -> position 3 L? Not E.

Not PILED.

Perhaps ""OILER"": O1,I2,L3,E4,R5 -> R absent.

Not.

Or better: ""BOGEY"" no P.

Perhaps we have to use a word that might have L at position 5 or P at position 1.

 or ""WHELP"": W1,H2,E3,L4,P5? Pattern: W H E L P -> positions: W1, H2, E3, L4, P5.

This has E at position 3! and L at position 4, P at position 5.

Now, L at position 4: that is not position 2, so it's allowed? Yes.
P at position 5: not at position 4, so also allowed.

And it contains L and P.

Now, does it have any of the absent letters? The letters are W,H,E,L,P.

Check absent: previously absent: C,R,A,N,S,T – W,H are new and not absent? So it should be ok.

Now, is ""whelp"" a word? Yes, it means a young dog or to give birth (for animals). Valid.

And we can use it.

If not, but it fits.

So, third guess: ""whelp"" – W H E L P

But let's confirm:

- Position 3 E: fixed.
- L is at position 4: which is fine, since we only know not at position 2.
- P is at position 5: fine, not at position 4.

And we test W and H, which we don't know.

Also, avoids all known absent letters.

So, I choose ""WHELP"".

If not, but I think it's a valid word.

Alternatively, other words? Like ""IMPELL"" is 6 letters.

Or ""BELIE"" only 5: B E L I E -> position 3 L, not E.

So, ""whelp"" seems a good choice.

### Thought Process

Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)**  
  This indicates:
  - C, R, A, N are **not** in the secret word.
  - E is in the secret word but **not in position 5** (since it was guessed at position 5).

- **Guess 2: slept → Feedback: S(x) L(-) E(✓) P(-) T(x)**  
  This indicates:
  - S and T are **not** in the secret word.
  - E is **in the secret word and correctly placed at position 3** (since in ""slept"", E is the third letter).
  - L is in the word but **not at position 2**.
  - P is in the word but **not at position 4**.

### Key Insights from Feedback:
- **Confirmed present letters**: E, L, P.
  - E must be at position 3 (fixed from the ✓ feedback in ""slept"").
- **Confirmed absent letters**: C, R, A, N, S, T.
- **Position constraints**:
  - E is fixed at position 3 (secret word pattern: `_ _ E _ _`).
  - L cannot be at position 2 (from ""slept"" feedback).
  - P cannot be at position 4 (from ""slept"" feedback).
- The secret word must:
  - Contain E at position 3.
  - Contain L and P in positions 1, 4, or 5 (for L; avoiding position 2) or positions 1, 2, or 5 (for P; avoiding position 4).
  - Exclude absent letters (C, R, A, N, S, T).
  Use **new letters** to gather information on remaining possibilities.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Include E at position 3** (non-negotiable).
- **Include L and P** in positions other than the forbidden ones (L not position 2, P not position 4).
- **Test common new letters**: Focus on letters not yet guessed or ruled out, such as B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, U, V, W, Y, etc.
- **Form a valid English word**: Ensure the guess meets all constraints.

After reviewing possible words, **WHELP** fits:
- Pattern: `W H E L P`
  - Position 3 is E (correct placement).
  - L is at position 4 (allowed, since it must not be at position 2).
  - P is at position 5 (allowed, since it must not be at position 4).
- New letters tested: W and H (common consonants not excluded).
- No absent letters: Avoids C, R, A, N, S, T.
- Valid English word: ""WHELP"" means a young animal (e.g., puppy) and is 5 letters.

This guess efficiently tests L's position 4, P's position 5, and new letters (W, H) while leveraging the fixed E at position 3.

<guess>whelp</guess>",whelp,"We have feedback from two guesses:

From Guess 1 (""crane""):
- C(x): C not in word
- R(x): R not in word
- A(x): A not in word
- N(x): N not in word
- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 5

From Guess 2 (""slept""):
- S(x): S not in word
- L(-): L is in the word but not in position 2 (since in ""slept"", L was at position 2)
- E(✓): E is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, because in ""slept"", E is the third letter)
- P(-): P is in the word but not in position 4
- T(x): T not in word

So, what we know:
- Secret word contains: E (specifically at position 3), L, and P.
- E is fixed at position 3 (because we have a ✓).
- L is in the word but not at position 2.
- P is in the word but not at position 4.
- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, T (from both guesses, all marked x).

Additionally, we have E present and at position 3.

Let me list the knowns:
- Position 3: E (correct and fixed)

Known presents: E (fixed at 3), L (somewhere, not 2), P (somewhere, not 4)

Absent: C, R, A, N, S, T

Now, the secret word has 5 letters: _ _ E _ _

We know L and P must be in the word, but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively? Actually:
- L is in the word, but it was in position 2 in ""slept"" and that was wrong, so L cannot be at position 2. But it can be at positions 1,4, or 5? (since E is at 3)
- Similarly, P was at position 4 in ""slept"" and that was wrong, so P cannot be at position 4. It can be at positions 1,2,5.

Moreover, the secret word must have exactly three of the letters known (E, L, P) plus two more letters we haven't guessed yet? Or duplicate letters? But at least E, L, P are present.

But note: we don't know if there are duplicates. But we haven't seen any duplicates so far.

Now, for the next guess, we need to:
- Find a 5-letter word that has E at position 3 (since we know it's correct).
- Contains L and P (because they are present).
- Does NOT contain any of the absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, T.
- Also, we must consider the positions: L not at position 2, P not at position 4.

Moreover, since E is fixed at position 3, we only need to guess the other positions.

The word must be: positions 1,2,4,5 are unknown, but we must include L and P somewhere, with constraints.

We need to test for the remaining positions and find other letters.

But note: we have only 6 tries, so we should try to cover new common letters.

Common remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, U, V, W, Y, etc.

I need to choose a word with E at position 3, and includes L and P, avoiding absent letters.

Let me try to brainstorm words with the pattern: _ _ E _ _

And containing L and P.

Since L and P can be in various positions.

Possible positions:
- L can be in positions 1,4,5 (not 2)
- P can be in positions 1,2,5 (not 4)

But positions 1,2,4,5 are available for L and P and two other letters.

Since the secret word must have L and P, we need to fill two more positions with letters that are not known absent.

Let me try to think of common words that fit the constraints:

- Position 3 must be E: so words ending in EL? e.g., MODEL, BUT MODEL has D and L? Pattern: _ _ E L? But we need to have P too. Model has M,O,D,E,L -> five letters? MODEL: positions? 
  Position: M(1), O(2), D(3)? Wait, no, we need position 3 to be E. So not MODEL.

Words with E at position 3: third letter E.

Examples:
- BEGIN -> but G,I,N: N is absent? We cannot use N.
- BEVEL -> B,E,V,E,L -> has E at position 3? Position1: B, Pos2: E? But we need third letter E: BEVEL: B(1), E(2), V(3)? Not at 3.

I need words where the third letter is E.

Common ones: like GREEN? But G,R,E,E,N: has R and N - absent! Not allowed.

Another: FLYER? F(1), L(2), Y(3) -> not E.

Better list: 
APPLE? A(1), P(2), P(3) -> not E.

How about words like: 

- ""BLEEP"": B(1), L(2), E(3), E(4), P(5) -> pattern: positions: E at 3. But note: L is at position 2? But remember, in our constraints, L cannot be at position 2 because in ""slept"" L was at position 2 and it was wrong? So BLEEP has L at position 2? Not allowed? Actually, we don't know if position 2 is excluded for L? Yes, because in ""slept"", we had S,L,E,P,T and L was marked as '-' meaning L is in the word but not at position 2. So if we put L at position 2 again, it would be wrong again? So we should avoid position 2 for L.

Therefore, BLEEP is invalid because L is at position 2.

Similarly, ""PLEAD"": P(1), L(2), E(3), A(4), D(5) -> but L at position 2? Avoid position 2 for L, so not PLEAD. And A is absent? A is absent from the secret word? Yes, because first guess had A and it was marked absent.

We need words without placing L at position 2.

But we need L somewhere else.

How about L at position 1? Like ""LEPER"": L(1), E(2), P(3) -> but we need E at position 3? This has E at position 2? No, not matching.

Words with E at position 3 and L and P:

Hmm... consider: 

- ""HELPS"": H(1), E(2), L(3) -> L is at position 3? But we need E at position 3.

Not HELPS.

What about ""KELP"": only 4 letters.

5-letter words: 
- ""EXPEL"": E(1), X(2), P(3), E(4), L(5) -> has E at position 3? Positions: E(1), X(2), P(3), E(4), L(5). Position 3 is P, not E? No.

How about ""IMPEL"": I(1), M(2), P(3), E(4), L(5) -> position 4 is E? Not at position 3.

Now, E at position 3:

I recall words like:
- QUEEN: Q(1),U(2),E(3),E(4),N(5) -> N absent? Invalid.

- GREEN: G(1),R(2),E(3),E(4),N(5) -> R and N absent? R is absent? Yes, from first guess.

- FLEET: F(1),L(2),E(3),E(4),T(5) -> T is absent? From guess 2, T was marked absent? Yes. Also L at position 2: which we must avoid because we know L is not at position 2.

- SHEET: S and T absent? S and T are absent? Yes. 

Another: ""BLEEP"": as before, L at position 2? Avoid.

Perhaps put L at position 4 or 5?

How about: 

- ""DUPLE"": not common, and only 5 letters? D,U,P,L,E -> Pattern: D(1),U(2),P(3),L(4),E(5) -> position 3 is P? Not E.

We need position 3 to be E.

So, let's think of words like ...E...

With E at third slot.

For example: 
- WHALE: W(1), H(2), A(3) -> no.

Another: ""CREPT"": C and R absent? Yes.

Try without A, R, N, C, S, T.

Word must be: positions 1,2,3=E (fixed),4,5.

But position 3 is E? No, position 3 is fixed E, so word pattern: ABECD? Where A,B (position1,2), E(3), C(position4), D(position5).

But C,D are letters.

How about ""LIBEL"": L(1),I(2),B(3)? But position 3 must be E? Not B.

Not LIBEL.

Try: ""IMPEL"": wrong, E not at 3.

"" UPPER "": U(1),P(2),P(3),E(4),R(5) -> has P and ... no E at 3.

I need to use a dictionary? Since I'm thinking, I must recall English words.

Maybe ""AMPLE""? A(1),M(2),P(3) -> position 3 is P? Not E.

Another idea: ""ELOPE"": E(1),L(2),O(3),P(4),E(5) -> position 3 is O? Not E.

But we need position 3 to be E.

Possible words: 

- ""HOMED"": H(1),O(2),M(3) -> no.

Let me think phonetically: 

- Some 5-letter words: BEVEL (B,E,V,E,L) -> positions: B1, E2, V3 -> not E at 3.

Not BEVEL.

- ""LEVEL"": L1,E2,V3 -> V at 3? No.

- ""REVEL"": R1,E2,E3,V4,L5? R is absent? Yes, R was marked absent in guess 1.

Remove letters that are absent.

Letters allowed: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,M,O,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (and etc., missing the absent ones: C,R,A,N,S,T)

Now, word must include L and P.

Pattern: [ position1: any allowed ] [ position2: not L and any allowed ] [ position3: E ] [ position4: not P and any allowed ] [ position5 ]

Let me think... 

Perhaps ""MAPLE"": M1,A2,P3,L4,E5 -> position 3 is P? Not E, and also A absent.

Not ""MAPLE"".

How about ""LUPUS"": no E.

Idea: include E at position 3:

""QUELL"": Q1,U2,E3,L4,L5? -> but only 4 letters? Que l l is 4? Wait: QUELL is 5: Q,U,E,L,L.

Pattern: Q1,U2,E3,L4,L5 -> position 3 E. Also, includes L at positions 4 and 5? But we need to include P? This doesn't have P? We must have P in the word? Yes.

QUELL lacks P.

But has E at position 3: good.

But no P.

We need a word with E at position 3, and L and P both.

OK, another word: ""PELTS"": P1,E2,L3,T4,S5 -> position 3 L? Not E, and S,T absent? Double absent.

Not good.

""EXPEL"": E1,X2,P3,E4,L5 -> position 3 P? Not E.

""DELVE"": D1,E2,L3,V4,E5 -> position 3 L? Not E.

Perhaps ""PIXEL"": P1,I2,X3,E4,L5 -> no E at position 3.

How about ""FILLET"" is 6 letters.

Another: ""POUFE"" but not common.

Maybe ""OILED"": O1,I2,L3,E4,D5 -> position 3 L? Not E.

The closest I can think is ""BELLE"": B1,E2,L3,L4,E5? Position 3 L? Not E for position 3, and E at position 2? No.

Perhaps ""DWEEB"" not common.

I might be missing common words.

Let me search: words with third letter E and containing L and P.

For example: ""P E L E C"" but not English.

Perhaps the word ""AMPLE"" doesn't have E at 3.

Another: ""PEACE"" has C? Absent.

""PLEDGE"" is 6 letters.

""PLEBE"" is 5 letters: P1,L2,E3,B4,E5? This has E at position 3! And L at position 2.

PLEBE: P, L, E, B, E -> pattern: position1: P, position2: L, position3: E, position4: B, position5: E.

But now, is this valid? We have L at position 2. But previous feedback said L is not at position 2? Because in ""slept"" L was at position 2 and it was marked '-', meaning L is in the word but not at position 2. Therefore, positioning L at position 2 again would be incorrect. So PLEBE has L at position 2, so it would give a '-' for L at position 2 again? But we want to find the secret word. We must avoid placing L at position 2.

Therefore, PLEBE is not allowed since L must not be at position 2.

So what words have E at position 3 and include L and P without positioning L at position 2 or P at position 4?

How about placing L at position 1 or 4 or 5, and P at position 1,2,5.

For example:
- L at position 4:
  Word like a b e l p? But that would be ... E then L? But p must be somewhere.

Let's try ""HIPPO"": no E.

Perhaps ""CREEK"" has C? Absent.

I think of ""BLEEP"" but L at 2, not allowed.

Wait, another word: ""ELITE"" has no P? No.

""BELCH"" has L at 4? B1,E2,L3,C4,H5? Position 3 l? Not E.

Perhaps we can use a word that doesn't have L at 2 or P at 4.

For example, L at position 1: then the first letter L, second letter ?, third E, then ? and P.

Pattern: L _, E, _, _

Or L at position 4: _, _, E, L, _

Or L at position 5: _, _, E, _, L

And P similarly: P can be at 1,2,5.

So possible:

If L at position 1: L?EP? no, must be L?E? but then position 4 and 5, one of which must be P? Or position 2 can be P.

Position 2 can have P because P can be at 2.

For example: word starting with L, then P? LPE?? 

Like 'L PEP'? Not word.

But let me list actual words:

For example, ""LUPUS"": no E.

Another: ""LAPSE"": L1,A2,P3,S4,E5 -> but position 3 P? Not E, and S,T absent? Also A absent.

Not good.

Perhaps L at position 4: then pattern: ? ? E L ?

And P must be in position 1 or 2 or 5.

Example: ""JEWEL"": J1,E2,W3,E4,L5 -> position 3 W? Not E.

""COPSE"": C absent? and position 3 P, no.

""BUGLE"": B1,U2,G3,E4,L5 -> position 3 G? Not E.

But position 4 is E? Not position 3.

Perhaps "" Fable "" F1,A2,B3,L4,E5 -> absent A? and position 3 not E.

I'm struggling.

Another idea: the word ""PILED"": P1,I2,L3,E4,D5 -> position 3 L? Not E.

Not PILED.

Perhaps ""OILER"": O1,I2,L3,E4,R5 -> R absent.

Not.

Or better: ""BOGEY"" no P.

Perhaps we have to use a word that might have L at position 5 or P at position 1.

 or ""WHELP"": W1,H2,E3,L4,P5? Pattern: W H E L P -> positions: W1, H2, E3, L4, P5.

This has E at position 3! and L at position 4, P at position 5.

Now, L at position 4: that is not position 2, so it's allowed? Yes.
P at position 5: not at position 4, so also allowed.

And it contains L and P.

Now, does it have any of the absent letters? The letters are W,H,E,L,P.

Check absent: previously absent: C,R,A,N,S,T – W,H are new and not absent? So it should be ok.

Now, is ""whelp"" a word? Yes, it means a young dog or to give birth (for animals). Valid.

And we can use it.

If not, but it fits.

So, third guess: ""whelp"" – W H E L P

But let's confirm:

- Position 3 E: fixed.
- L is at position 4: which is fine, since we only know not at position 2.
- P is at position 5: fine, not at position 4.

And we test W and H, which we don't know.

Also, avoids all known absent letters.

So, I choose ""WHELP"".

If not, but I think it's a valid word.

Alternatively, other words? Like ""IMPELL"" is 6 letters.

Or ""BELIE"" only 5: B E L I E -> position 3 L, not E.

So, ""whelp"" seems a good choice.### Thought Process
