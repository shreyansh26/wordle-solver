Alright, let's start with our first guess in Wordle. Since we have no prior feedback, I need to choose a word that maximizes information gain. The best starting words usually contain common letters and avoid repetition. 

Common English letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S. I should pick a word that uses several of these. ""ROATE"" is often recommended as it covers frequent letters like R, O, A, T, E. But after thinking, let me verify: R and T are very common consonants, O and A are common vowels, and E is the most common letter overall. 

Alternative starting words include ""CRANE,"" ""SLATE,"" or ""TRACE."" Each uses five distinct common letters. Among these, ""CRANE"" stands out because:
- C appears in many words though not top tier frequency
- R, A, E are top-10 frequency letters
- N is also relatively common

This covers vowel/consonant balance well. After comparison...
</think>
For the first guess, selecting a word with diverse and common letters increases chances of hitting relevant letters in the secret word. After considering options like ""ROATE"" (statistically strong), ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"", the latter stands out:  
- Uses 5 distinct high-frequency letters (**C**, **R**, **A**, **N**, **E**)  
- Covers major vowels (**A**, **E**) and versatile consonants  
- Positions letters optimally (e.g., **E** at end matches many words)  

This maximizes initial information for refining subsequent guesses.

We are given the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": 
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The letter A is in the secret word but not in the third position (since it was the third letter in ""crane"" and marked wrong position).
- The letters C, R, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

We must avoid using C, R, N, E in our next guess.

Moreover, we know that A is present, so we must include A in the new guess, but not in the third position.

For a second guess, we want to try to place A in a different position and use other common letters that we haven't tried yet. We have eliminated 4 letters: C, R, N, E. The remaining available letters are most of the alphabet. We should pick a word that includes A and four new letters that are common to get more information.

Common English letters remaining: S, T, O, I, L, D, U, M, P, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, V, J, X, Q, Z.

We can choose a word that starts with or contains A and avoids the eliminated letters.

We also note that A cannot be in position 3.

Ideally, we place A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Let's think of common words that contain A and four other common letters not in {C,R,N,E}.

Some possibilities:
- Using the letter A and other high frequency letters: S, T, L, I, O, etc.

Word ideas:
- ""SLATE"": but we must avoid E because it was eliminated? Wait, E is eliminated -> x meaning not present, so we cannot use E. ""SLATE"" has E which is eliminated.
- ""PLANT"": has N which is eliminated -> cannot use N.
- ""TRAIL"": has R which is eliminated -> discard.
- ""FLAIL"": has L twice and R? Wait, R is eliminated -> discard.

We need to avoid C, R, N, E.

Let's try words with A and other available letters.

Good words might include ""SAVOR"", ""STOMP"", but they don't have A? We must include A because we know it is in the word.

So, words that have A and avoid C,R,N,E:

Possible words: 
- ""SALAD"" -> but double A? Actually, double A may not be ideal because we don't know if the secret word has two A's. But it's acceptable if we don't have a better word. However, note that in ""SALAD"", A is in position 2 and 4? But we have only one A in the secret word? Actually, we don't know, but for information, using repeated letters is less informative.

Better to try a word with distinct letters and also covering new common letters.

Good candidate: ""PASTA"" -> P,A,S,T,A -> repeated A? Again, same issue.

""PAINT"" -> but N is eliminated -> invalid.

""FAULT"" -> letters: F,A,U,L,T. None of these are in the eliminated set. So: F, A, U, L, T.

But U is not very common? Another word: ""PLAIT"" -> again, has L,T? Wait, A, I, T, etc. But let's avoid uncommon constructs.

""BOAST"" -> B,O,A,S,T. Letters: B,O,A,S,T. All distinct and all new, and avoid eliminated letters.

But note: A must not be in the third position. In ""BOAST"", A is in the third position? 
B O A S T -> A is in position 3? We need to avoid position 3 for A? 
But the feedback says A is in the word but not in the third position. So putting A in third position again might be wasting a spot? However, if we put A in third position and it gets a ✓ then we know the secret word has A in third which contradicts previous feedback? Actually, no: the previous feedback says A is not in third, so if we put A in third and it is marked x then it confirms, but if it gets ✓ that would be impossible? Actually, no because it's a different guess? But the secret word is fixed: we know A is not in the third position, so if we put A in third again and it gets ✓ that would conflict? Therefore, we should avoid position 3 for A.

So in ""BOAST"", A is in position 3 -> not ideal because we know it cannot be there. We need to put A in a different position.

How about:
- Position 1: A? -> e.g., ""ADIEU"" but has E (eliminated) -> invalid.
- Position 2: A? -> e.g., ""HASTY"" -> H,A,S,T,Y -> but H and Y not too common? But acceptable.
- Position 4: A? -> e.g., ""OPALS"" -> O,P,A,L,S -> but note, ""OPALS"" is plural? Maybe acceptable in wordle? Usually allowed if it's a word.

Wordle accepts common nouns, including plurals? But sometimes plurals can be tricky. Let me stick to non-plural.

Another idea: ""STAND"" -> has N (eliminated) -> invalid.
""SHALT"" -> not very common.

A better word: ""PASTY"" -> P,A,S,T,Y -> but A in position 2, and P,S,T,Y are new. This word may be unfamiliar? But it is a word (like the food or resembling paste).

Alternatively: ""MAILS"" -> M,A,I,L,S -> but A in position 2, and it's a common word? M-A-I-L-S. 

But let's systematically think of words that avoid [C,R,N,E] and have A in position not 3.

I recall that starting words like ""AUDIO"" have A and other vowels, but ""AUDIO"" has A in position 1 and avoids our eliminations? Letters: A,U,D,I,O -> no C,R,N,E? Yes.

Moreover, ""AUDIO"" uses vowels and D, but the eliminated letters are consonants? Anyway, it uses new letters.

But we already know A is in the word, so we could try ""AUDIO"" to check multiple vowels. However, it might be better to cover more common consonants.

Another word: ""BAILS"" -> B,A,I,L,S -> A in position 2.

But ""BAILS"" is fine.

Let's list possible words:

Position 1: A
- Words: ""ABIDE"" -> has E -> invalid.
- ""ABOUT"": A,B,O,U,T -> avoids eliminated letters? Yes: A, B, O, U, T -> all clear.

Position 2: A
- ""WAITS"": W,A,I,T,S -> avoids eliminated letters? W,A,I,T,S are not in {C,R,N,E} -> yes.

Position 4: A
- ""FOAMY"": F,O,A,M,Y -> but Y? Valid word? Yes, meaning frothy? Also: ""LOCAL"" has L,O,C,A,L -> C is eliminated -> invalid.

Position 5: A? We can have words ending with A, but that's less common in 5-letter words.

So, strong candidates:

Option 1: ""ABOUT"": A in position 1, and letters: A, B, O, U, T.

Option 2: ""WAIST"": W, A, I, S, T -> A in position 2.

Option 3: ""AUDIO"": A in position 1, U,D,I,O -> checks vowels.

Considering frequency, consonants like T, S, L are more common than U, O. But we also want to cover more frequent letters.

We have already eliminated E and R (which are high frequency), so next are T, O, I, S, etc.

I think ""WAIST"" or ""PASTA"" (but ""PASTA"" has two A's? Let me check: P,A,S,T,A -> repeated A? Actually, letters P,A,S,T -> but spelled P-A-S-T-A so positions: P1: P, P2: A, P3: S, P4: T, P5: A -> so we have two A's? That might be okay, but it reduces diversity.

Avoiding repeated letters is better for information.

So, ""WAIST"": distinct letters: W, A, I, S, T. And T, S are very common.

Similarly, ""ABOUT"" has A,B,O,U,T -> also distinct.

Now, ""AUDIO"": distinct and vowels.

But since we know A is already in the word, testing consonants might yield more information because vowels are less prevalent in positions? 

I think ""WAIST"" is a good choice because it places A in position 2 (not 3) and introduces S, T, W, I. S and T are very common.

Another candidate: ""LASTS"" -> repeated S -> bad.

I think ""WAIST"" is solid.

But let me double-check whether ""WAIST"" is acceptable: it's a word meaning the middle part of the body.

Alternatively, ""CHAOS"" -> but we have C eliminated -> invalid.

Or ""PLAID"" -> but has L and D? Letters: P,L,A,I,D -> avoids eliminations? P,L,A,I,D. Yes. And A is in position 3? Wait, PLAID: P,L,A,I,D -> A in position 3 -> we must avoid that? Yes, because we know A is not in position 3? 

PLAID: 
- Position 3: A -> but we cannot put A in position 3 because we know it's not correct? Actually, we can put it anywhere? But if we put it in position 3 and it comes back as A again in wrong position (because it is not in position 3 in the secret word) then we learn nothing new? Actually, we can: if we put A in position 3 and it gets marked as (-) meaning in the word but wrong position? Then we know the secret word does not have A in position 3 (which we already know) but also we have A in this position so it would be confusing? 

Wait, no: the feedback specifies per letter. If the secret word has an A but not in position 3, then when we put A in position 3, it should yield a ""-"" meaning in the word but wrong position? Exactly as before? But that doesn't tell us anything new. Actually, we already know A is not in position 3? So we can try a position that might be correct? 

But we don't know which position A is in? Only that it is not 3. So we could put A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5? So we have four possibilities? 

Therefore, in the next guess, we should try A in one of the other positions, such as 1 or 2 or 4? 

Therefore, ""WAIST"" has A in position 2 -> promising because if we get a ✓ then we know A is in position 2? 

Similarly, if we put A in position 1? 

Given we want information, placing A in a new position (not 3) is good. 

Now, among ""ABOUT"" and ""WAIST"", both are valid. 

But ""WAIST"" uses W and I? Not as common as T? Actually, ""WAIST"" has T and S? 

Frequency-wise, S is one of the most common? 

I think ""WAIST"" is a good word? Let me search for something better? 

Another word: ""PAID?"" but 4-letter? Wait, 5-letters: ""PALMS"" -> avoids eliminations? P,A,L,M,S -> yes? A in position 2? 

But ""PALMS"" is common? 

Let me stick to ""WAIST""? 

But perhaps a better word is ""SLATE"", but we can't because E is eliminated? 

Given the constraints, let me choose ""WAIST"" as the next guess.

Wait, but let me confirm available letters: no C,R,N,E? So W,A,I,S,T are clean? Yes? And W, I, T, S are new.

So we can expect feedback on A (in position 2) and S,T,W,I? At least we'll learn about these.

Perhaps choose a word with more common consonants than W? W is less common? But S and T are very common? 

Word ""HASTY""? But Y? 

I think ""WAIST"" is acceptable? 

Alternatively, ""TOAST""? But O? Wait, ""TOAST"": T,O,A,S,T -> repeated T? And A in position 3? Oh position? T O A S T -> position 1:T, 2:O, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T -> A in position 3 -> bad? We must avoid position 3 for A? 

So not both repeated letter and in position 3? 

Therefore, I'll go with ""WAIST"". 

So second guess: WAIST

Now, we must format: <guess>waist</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"", we know:
- A is in the secret word but not in position 3 (marked ""-"").
- C, R, N, and E are **not** in the word at all (marked ""x"").
- Therefore, the next guess must include A in a position other than 3 (i.e., position 1, 2, 4, or 5) and avoid using C, R, N, E.

For optimal information gain, the new guess should:
- Contain A in a different position than the previous guess (position 3).
- Use common English letters not yet tested, prioritizing consonants like S, T, L, O, I, etc., which have higher frequency.
- Avoid repeated letters to maximize letter coverage.

Considering these constraints, a strong candidate is ""waist"":
- Places A in position 2 (previously untested position).
- Introduces new common letters: W, S, I, T (all not eliminated).
- Avoids position 3 for A and excludes forbidden letters (C, R, N, E).
- Provides balanced information: tests two vowels (A, I) and three consonants (W, S, T), while targeting a common position for A.

Other options were considered (e.g., ""about"" for position 1 A, ""pasta"" for position 4 A) but ""waist"" uses more frequent consonants (S, T) and avoids repetition or uncommon letters.

Thought process summary: Focus on validating A's position and uncovering new letters efficiently with ""waist"".

<guess>waist</guess>",waist,"We are given the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": 
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)

- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:

But we already know A is in the word, so we could try ""AUDIO"" to check multiple vowels. However, it might be better to cover more common consonants.

Another word: ""BAILS"" -> B,A,I,L,S -> A in position 2.

But ""BAILS"" is fine.

Let's list possible words:

Position 1: A
- Words: ""ABIDE"" -> has E -> invalid.
- ""ABOUT"": A,B,O,U,T -> avoids eliminated letters? Yes: A, B, O, U, T -> all clear.

Position 2: A
- ""WAITS"": W,A,I,T,S -> avoids eliminated letters? W,A,I,T,S are not in {C,R,N,E} -> yes.

Position 4: A
- ""FOAMY"": F,O,A,M,Y -> but Y? Valid word? Yes, meaning frothy? Also: ""LOCAL"" has L,O,C,A,L -> C is eliminated -> invalid.

Position 5: A? We can have words ending with A, but that's less common in 5-letter words.

So, strong candidates:

Option 1: ""ABOUT"": A in position 1, and letters: A, B, O, U, T.

Option 2: ""WAIST"": W, A, I, S, T -> A in position 2.

Option 3: ""AUDIO"": A in position 1, U,D,I,O -> checks vowels.

Considering frequency, consonants like T, S, L are more common than U, O. But we also want to cover more frequent letters.

We have already eliminated E and R (which are high frequency), so next are T, O, I, S, etc.

I think ""WAIST"" or ""PASTA"" (but ""PASTA"" has two A's? Let me check: P,A,S,T,A -> repeated A? Actually, letters P,A,S,T -> but spelled P-A-S-T-A so positions: P1: P, P2: A, P3: S, P4: T, P5: A -> so we have two A's? That might be okay, but it reduces diversity.

Avoiding repeated letters is better for information.

So, ""WAIST"": distinct letters: W, A, I, S, T. And T, S are very common.

Similarly, ""ABOUT"" has A,B,O,U,T -> also distinct.

Now, ""AUDIO"": distinct and vowels.

But since we know A is already in the word, testing consonants might yield more information because vowels are less prevalent in positions? 

I think ""WAIST"" is a good choice because it places A in position 2 (not 3) and introduces S, T, W, I. S and T are very common.

Another candidate: ""LASTS"" -> repeated S -> bad.

I think ""WAIST"" is solid.

But let me double-check whether ""WAIST"" is acceptable: it's a word meaning the middle part of the body.

Alternatively, ""CHAOS"" -> but we have C eliminated -> invalid.

Or ""PLAID"" -> but has L and D? Letters: P,L,A,I,D -> avoids eliminations? P,L,A,I,D. Yes. And A is in position 3? Wait, PLAID: P,L,A,I,D -> A in position 3 -> we must avoid that? Yes, because we know A is not in position 3? 

PLAID: 
- Position 3: A -> but we cannot put A in position 3 because we know it's not correct? Actually, we can put it anywhere? But if we put it in position 3 and it comes back as A again in wrong position (because it is not in position 3 in the secret word) then we learn nothing new? Actually, we can: if we put A in position 3 and it gets marked as (-) meaning in the word but wrong position? Then we know the secret word does not have A in position 3 (which we already know) but also we have A in this position so it would be confusing? 

Wait, no: the feedback specifies per letter. If the secret word has an A but not in position 3, then when we put A in position 3, it should yield a ""-"" meaning in the word but wrong position? Exactly as before? But that doesn't tell us anything new. Actually, we already know A is not in position 3? So we can try a position that might be correct? 

But we don't know which position A is in? Only that it is not 3. So we could put A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5? So we have four possibilities? 

Therefore, in the next guess, we should try A in one of the other positions, such as 1 or 2 or 4? 

Therefore, ""WAIST"" has A in position 2 -> promising because if we get a ✓ then we know A is in position 2? 

Similarly, if we put A in position 1? 

Given we want information, placing A in a new position (not 3) is good. 

Now, among ""ABOUT"" and ""WAIST"", both are valid. 

But ""WAIST"" uses W and I? Not as common as T? Actually, ""WAIST"" has T and S? 

Frequency-wise, S is one of the most common? 

I think ""WAIST"" is a good word? Let me search for something better? 

Another word: ""PAID?"" but 4-letter? Wait, 5-letters: ""PALMS"" -> avoids eliminations? P,A,L,M,S -> yes? A in position 2? 

But ""PALMS"" is common? 

Let me stick to ""WAIST""? 

But perhaps a better word is ""SLATE"", but we can't because E is eliminated? 

Given the constraints, let me choose ""WAIST"" as the next guess.

Wait, but let me confirm available letters: no C,R,N,E? So W,A,I,S,T are clean? Yes? And W, I, T, S are new.

So we can expect feedback on A (in position 2) and S,T,W,I? At least we'll learn about these.

Perhaps choose a word with more common consonants than W? W is less common? But S and T are very common? 

Word ""HASTY""? But Y? 

I think ""WAIST"" is acceptable? 

Alternatively, ""TOAST""? But O? Wait, ""TOAST"": T,O,A,S,T -> repeated T? And A in position 3? Oh position? T O A S T -> position 1:T, 2:O, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T -> A in position 3 -> bad? We must avoid position 3 for A? 

So not both repeated letter and in position 3? 

Therefore, I'll go with ""WAIST"". 

So second guess: WAIST

Now, we must format: <guess>waist</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"", we know:
- A is in the secret word but not in position 3 (marked ""-"").
- C, R, N, and E are **not** in the word at all (marked ""x"").
- Therefore, the next guess must include A in a position other than 3 (i.e., position 1, 2, 4, or 5) and avoid using C, R, N, E.

For optimal information gain, the new guess should:
- Contain A in a different position than the previous guess (position 3).
- Use common English letters not yet tested, prioritizing consonants like S, T, L, O, I, etc., which have higher frequency.
- Avoid repeated letters to maximize letter coverage.

Considering these constraints, a strong candidate is ""waist"":
- Places A in position 2 (previously untested position).
- Introduces new common letters: W, S, I, T (all not eliminated).
- Avoids position 3 for A and excludes forbidden letters (C, R, N, E).
- Provides balanced information: tests two vowels (A, I) and three consonants (W, S, T), while targeting a common position for A.

Other options were considered (e.g., ""about"" for position 1 A, ""pasta"" for position 4 A) but ""waist"" uses more frequent consonants (S, T) and avoids repetition or uncommon letters.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>Alright, let's start with our first guess in Wordle. Since we have no prior feedback, I need to choose a word that maximizes information gain. The best starting words usually contain common letters and avoid repetition. 

Common English letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S. I should pick a word that uses several of these. ""ROATE"" is often recommended as it covers frequent letters like R, O, A, T, E. But after thinking, let me verify: R and T are very common consonants, O and A are common vowels, and E is the most common letter overall. 

Alternative starting words include ""CRANE,"" ""SLATE,"" or ""TRACE."" Each uses five distinct common letters. Among these, ""CRANE"" stands out because:
- C appears in many words though not top tier frequency
- R, A, E are top-10 frequency letters
- N is also relatively common

This covers vowel/consonant balance well. After comparison...For the first guess, selecting a word with diverse and common letters increases chances of hitting relevant letters in the secret word. After considering options like ""ROATE"" (statistically strong), ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"", the latter stands out:  
- Uses 5 distinct high-frequency letters (**C**, **R**, **A**, **N**, **E**)  
- Covers major vowels (**A**, **E**) and versatile consonants  
- Positions letters optimally (e.g., **E** at end matches many words)  

This maximizes initial information for refining subsequent guesses.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": 
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The letter A is in the secret word but not in the third position (since it was the third letter in ""crane"" and marked wrong position).
- The letters C, R, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

We must avoid using C, R, N, E in our next guess.

Moreover, we know that A is present, so we must include A in the new guess, but not in the third position.

For a second guess, we want to try to place A in a different position and use other common letters that we haven't tried yet. We have eliminated 4 letters: C, R, N, E. The remaining available letters are most of the alphabet. We should pick a word that includes A and four new letters that are common to get more information.

Common English letters remaining: S, T, O, I, L, D, U, M, P, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, V, J, X, Q, Z.

We can choose a word that starts with or contains A and avoids the eliminated letters.

We also note that A cannot be in position 3.

Ideally, we place A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Let's think of common words that contain A and four other common letters not in {C,R,N,E}.

Some possibilities:
- Using the letter A and other high frequency letters: S, T, L, I, O, etc.

Word ideas:
- ""SLATE"": but we must avoid E because it was eliminated? Wait, E is eliminated -> x meaning not present, so we cannot use E. ""SLATE"" has E which is eliminated.
- ""PLANT"": has N which is eliminated -> cannot use N.
- ""TRAIL"": has R which is eliminated -> discard.
- ""FLAIL"": has L twice and R? Wait, R is eliminated -> discard.

We need to avoid C, R, N, E.

Let's try words with A and other available letters.

Good words might include ""SAVOR"", ""STOMP"", but they don't have A? We must include A because we know it is in the word.

So, words that have A and avoid C,R,N,E:

Possible words: 
- ""SALAD"" -> but double A? Actually, double A may not be ideal because we don't know if the secret word has two A's. But it's acceptable if we don't have a better word. However, note that in ""SALAD"", A is in position 2 and 4? But we have only one A in the secret word? Actually, we don't know, but for information, using repeated letters is less informative.

Better to try a word with distinct letters and also covering new common letters.

Good candidate: ""PASTA"" -> P,A,S,T,A -> repeated A? Again, same issue.

""PAINT"" -> but N is eliminated -> invalid.

""FAULT"" -> letters: F,A,U,L,T. None of these are in the eliminated set. So: F, A, U, L, T.

But U is not very common? Another word: ""PLAIT"" -> again, has L,T? Wait, A, I, T, etc. But let's avoid uncommon constructs.

""BOAST"" -> B,O,A,S,T. Letters: B,O,A,S,T. All distinct and all new, and avoid eliminated letters.

But note: A must not be in the third position. In ""BOAST"", A is in the third position? 
B O A S T -> A is in position 3? We need to avoid position 3 for A? 
But the feedback says A is in the word but not in the third position. So putting A in third position again might be wasting a spot? However, if we put A in third position and it gets a ✓ then we know the secret word has A in third which contradicts previous feedback? Actually, no: the previous feedback says A is not in third, so if we put A in third and it is marked x then it confirms, but if it gets ✓ that would be impossible? Actually, no because it's a different guess? But the secret word is fixed: we know A is not in the third position, so if we put A in third again and it gets ✓ that would conflict? Therefore, we should avoid position 3 for A.

So in ""BOAST"", A is in position 3 -> not ideal because we know it cannot be there. We need to put A in a different position.

How about:
- Position 1: A? -> e.g., ""ADIEU"" but has E (eliminated) -> invalid.
- Position 2: A? -> e.g., ""HASTY"" -> H,A,S,T,Y -> but H and Y not too common? But acceptable.
- Position 4: A? -> e.g., ""OPALS"" -> O,P,A,L,S -> but note, ""OPALS"" is plural? Maybe acceptable in wordle? Usually allowed if it's a word.

Wordle accepts common nouns, including plurals? But sometimes plurals can be tricky. Let me stick to non-plural.

Another idea: ""STAND"" -> has N (eliminated) -> invalid.
""SHALT"" -> not very common.

A better word: ""PASTY"" -> P,A,S,T,Y -> but A in position 2, and P,S,T,Y are new. This word may be unfamiliar? But it is a word (like the food or resembling paste).

Alternatively: ""MAILS"" -> M,A,I,L,S -> but A in position 2, and it's a common word? M-A-I-L-S. 

But let's systematically think of words that avoid [C,R,N,E] and have A in position not 3.

I recall that starting words like ""AUDIO"" have A and other vowels, but ""AUDIO"" has A in position 1 and avoids our eliminations? Letters: A,U,D,I,O -> no C,R,N,E? Yes.

Moreover, ""AUDIO"" uses vowels and D, but the eliminated letters are consonants? Anyway, it uses new letters.

But we already know A is in the word, so we could try ""AUDIO"" to check multiple vowels. However, it might be better to cover more common consonants.

Another word: ""BAILS"" -> B,A,I,L,S -> A in position 2.

But ""BAILS"" is fine.

Let's list possible words:

Position 1: A
- Words: ""ABIDE"" -> has E -> invalid.
- ""ABOUT"": A,B,O,U,T -> avoids eliminated letters? Yes: A, B, O, U, T -> all clear.

Position 2: A
- ""WAITS"": W,A,I,T,S -> avoids eliminated letters? W,A,I,T,S are not in {C,R,N,E} -> yes.

Position 4: A
- ""FOAMY"": F,O,A,M,Y -> but Y? Valid word? Yes, meaning frothy? Also: ""LOCAL"" has L,O,C,A,L -> C is eliminated -> invalid.

Position 5: A? We can have words ending with A, but that's less common in 5-letter words.

So, strong candidates:

Option 1: ""ABOUT"": A in position 1, and letters: A, B, O, U, T.

Option 2: ""WAIST"": W, A, I, S, T -> A in position 2.

Option 3: ""AUDIO"": A in position 1, U,D,I,O -> checks vowels.

Considering frequency, consonants like T, S, L are more common than U, O. But we also want to cover more frequent letters.

We have already eliminated E and R (which are high frequency), so next are T, O, I, S, etc.

I think ""WAIST"" or ""PASTA"" (but ""PASTA"" has two A's? Let me check: P,A,S,T,A -> repeated A? Actually, letters P,A,S,T -> but spelled P-A-S-T-A so positions: P1: P, P2: A, P3: S, P4: T, P5: A -> so we have two A's? That might be okay, but it reduces diversity.

Avoiding repeated letters is better for information.

So, ""WAIST"": distinct letters: W, A, I, S, T. And T, S are very common.

Similarly, ""ABOUT"" has A,B,O,U,T -> also distinct.

Now, ""AUDIO"": distinct and vowels.

But since we know A is already in the word, testing consonants might yield more information because vowels are less prevalent in positions? 

I think ""WAIST"" is a good choice because it places A in position 2 (not 3) and introduces S, T, W, I. S and T are very common.

Another candidate: ""LASTS"" -> repeated S -> bad.

I think ""WAIST"" is solid.

But let me double-check whether ""WAIST"" is acceptable: it's a word meaning the middle part of the body.

Alternatively, ""CHAOS"" -> but we have C eliminated -> invalid.

Or ""PLAID"" -> but has L and D? Letters: P,L,A,I,D -> avoids eliminations? P,L,A,I,D. Yes. And A is in position 3? Wait, PLAID: P,L,A,I,D -> A in position 3 -> we must avoid that? Yes, because we know A is not in position 3? 

PLAID: 
- Position 3: A -> but we cannot put A in position 3 because we know it's not correct? Actually, we can put it anywhere? But if we put it in position 3 and it comes back as A again in wrong position (because it is not in position 3 in the secret word) then we learn nothing new? Actually, we can: if we put A in position 3 and it gets marked as (-) meaning in the word but wrong position? Then we know the secret word does not have A in position 3 (which we already know) but also we have A in this position so it would be confusing? 

Wait, no: the feedback specifies per letter. If the secret word has an A but not in position 3, then when we put A in position 3, it should yield a ""-"" meaning in the word but wrong position? Exactly as before? But that doesn't tell us anything new. Actually, we already know A is not in position 3? So we can try a position that might be correct? 

But we don't know which position A is in? Only that it is not 3. So we could put A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5? So we have four possibilities? 

Therefore, in the next guess, we should try A in one of the other positions, such as 1 or 2 or 4? 

Therefore, ""WAIST"" has A in position 2 -> promising because if we get a ✓ then we know A is in position 2? 

Similarly, if we put A in position 1? 

Given we want information, placing A in a new position (not 3) is good. 

Now, among ""ABOUT"" and ""WAIST"", both are valid. 

But ""WAIST"" uses W and I? Not as common as T? Actually, ""WAIST"" has T and S? 

Frequency-wise, S is one of the most common? 

I think ""WAIST"" is a good word? Let me search for something better? 

Another word: ""PAID?"" but 4-letter? Wait, 5-letters: ""PALMS"" -> avoids eliminations? P,A,L,M,S -> yes? A in position 2? 

But ""PALMS"" is common? 

Let me stick to ""WAIST""? 

But perhaps a better word is ""SLATE"", but we can't because E is eliminated? 

Given the constraints, let me choose ""WAIST"" as the next guess.

Wait, but let me confirm available letters: no C,R,N,E? So W,A,I,S,T are clean? Yes? And W, I, T, S are new.

So we can expect feedback on A (in position 2) and S,T,W,I? At least we'll learn about these.

Perhaps choose a word with more common consonants than W? W is less common? But S and T are very common? 

Word ""HASTY""? But Y? 

I think ""WAIST"" is acceptable? 

Alternatively, ""TOAST""? But O? Wait, ""TOAST"": T,O,A,S,T -> repeated T? And A in position 3? Oh position? T O A S T -> position 1:T, 2:O, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T -> A in position 3 -> bad? We must avoid position 3 for A? 

So not both repeated letter and in position 3? 

Therefore, I'll go with ""WAIST"". 

So second guess: WAIST

Now, we must format: <guess>waist</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"", we know:
- A is in the secret word but not in position 3 (marked ""-"").
- C, R, N, and E are **not** in the word at all (marked ""x"").
- Therefore, the next guess must include A in a position other than 3 (i.e., position 1, 2, 4, or 5) and avoid using C, R, N, E.

- Contain A in a different position than the previous guess (position 3).
- Use common English letters not yet tested, prioritizing consonants like S, T, L, O, I, etc., which have higher frequency.

Considering these constraints, a strong candidate is ""waist"":

Other options were considered (e.g., ""about"" for position 1 A, ""pasta"" for position 4 A) but ""waist"" uses more frequent consonants (S, T) and avoids repetition or uncommon letters.

Again, same issue.\n\n""PAINT"" -> but N is eliminated -> invalid.\n\n""FAULT"" -> letters: F,A,U,L,T. None of these are in the eliminated set. So: F, A, U, L, T.\n\nBut U is not very common? Another word: ""PLAIT"" -> again, has L,T? Wait, A, I, T, etc. But let\'s avoid uncommon constructs.\n\n""BOAST"" -> B,O,A,S,T. Letters: B,O,A,S,T. All distinct and all new, and avoid eliminated letters.\n\nBut note: A must not be in the third position. In ""BOAST"", A is in the third position? \nB O A S T -> A is in position 3? We need to avoid position 3 for A? \nBut the feedback says A is in the word but not in the third position. So putting A in third position again might be wasting a spot? However, if we put A in third position and it gets a ✓ then we know the secret word has A in third which contradicts previous feedback? Actually, no: the previous feedback says A is not in third, so if we put A in third and it is marked x then it confirms, but if it gets ✓ that would be impossible? Actually, no because it\'s a different guess? But the secret word is fixed: we know A is not in the third position, so if we put A in third again and it gets ✓ that would conflict? Therefore, we should avoid position 3 for A.\n\nSo in ""BOAST"", A is in position 3 -> not ideal because we know it cannot be there. We need to put A in a different position.\n\nHow about:\n- Position 1: A? -> e.g., ""ADIEU"" but has E (eliminated) -> invalid.\n- Position 2: A? -> e.g., ""HASTY"" -> H,A,S,T,Y -> but H and Y not too common? But acceptable.\n- Position 4: A? -> e.g., ""OPALS"" -> O,P,A,L,S -> but note, ""OPALS"" is plural? Maybe acceptable in wordle? Usually allowed if it\'s a word.\n\nWordle accepts common nouns, including plurals? But sometimes plurals can be tricky. Let me stick to non-plural.\n\nAnother idea: ""STAND"" -> has N (eliminated) -> invalid.\n""SHALT"" -> not very common.\n\nA better word: ""PASTY"" -> P,A,S,T,Y -> but A in position 2, and P,S,T,Y are new. This word may be unfamiliar? But it is a word (like the food or resembling paste).\n\nAlternatively: ""MAILS"" -> M,A,I,L,S -> but A in position 2, and it\'s a common word? M-A-I-L-S. \n\nBut let\'s systematically think of words that avoid [C,R,N,E] and have A in position not 3.\n\nI recall that starting words like ""AUDIO"" have A and other vowels, but ""AUDIO"" has A in position 1 and avoids our eliminations? Letters: A,U,D,I,O -> no C,R,N,E? Yes.\n\nMoreover, ""AUDIO"" uses vowels and D, but the eliminated letters are consonants? Anyway, it uses new letters.\n\nBut we already know A is in the word, so we could try ""AUDIO"" to check multiple vowels. However, it might be better to cover more common consonants.\n\nAnother word: ""BAILS"" -> B,A,I,L,S -> A in position 2.\n\nBut ""BAILS"" is fine.\n\nLet\'s list possible words:\n\nPosition 1: A\n- Words: ""ABIDE"" -> has E -> invalid.\n- ""ABOUT"": A,B,O,U,T -> avoids eliminated letters? Yes: A, B, O, U, T -> all clear.\n\nPosition 2: A\n- ""WAITS"": W,A,I,T,S -> avoids eliminated letters? W,A,I,T,S are not in {C,R,N,E} -> yes.\n\nPosition 4: A\n- ""FOAMY"": F,O,A,M,Y -> but Y? Valid word? Yes, meaning frothy? Also: ""LOCAL"" has L,O,C,A,L -> C is eliminated -> invalid.\n\nPosition 5: A? We can have words ending with A, but that\'s less common in 5-letter words.\n\nSo, strong candidates:\n\nOption 1: ""ABOUT"": A in position 1, and letters: A, B, O, U, T.\n\nOption 2: ""WAIST"": W, A, I, S, T -> A in position 2.\n\nOption 3: ""AUDIO"": A in position 1, U,D,I,O -> checks vowels.\n\nConsidering frequency, consonants like T, S, L are more common than U, O. But we also want to cover more frequent letters.\n\nWe have already eliminated E and R (which are high frequency), so next are T, O, I, S, etc.\n\nI think ""WAIST"" or ""PASTA"" (but ""PASTA"" has two A\'s? Let me check: P,A,S,T,A -> repeated A? Actually, letters P,A,S,T -> but spelled P-A-S-T-A so positions: P1: P, P2: A, P3: S, P4: T, P5: A -> so we have two A\'s? That might be okay, but it reduces diversity.\n\nAvoiding repeated letters is better for information.\n\nSo, ""WAIST"": distinct letters: W, A, I, S, T. And T, S are very common.\n\nSimilarly, ""ABOUT"" has A,B,O,U,T -> also distinct.\n\nNow, ""AUDIO"": distinct and vowels.\n\nBut since we know A is already in the word, testing consonants might yield more information because vowels are less prevalent in positions? \n\nI think ""WAIST"" is a good choice because it places A in position 2 (not 3) and introduces S, T, W, I. S and T are very common.\n\nAnother candidate: ""LASTS"" -> repeated S -> bad.\n\nI think ""WAIST"" is solid.\n\nBut let me double-check whether ""WAIST"" is acceptable: it\'s a word meaning the middle part of the body.\n\nAlternatively, ""CHAOS"" -> but we have C eliminated -> invalid.\n\nOr ""PLAID"" -> but has L and D? Letters: P,L,A,I,D -> avoids eliminations? P,L,A,I,D. Yes. And A is in position 3? Wait, PLAID: P,L,A,I,D -> A in position 3 -> we must avoid that? Yes, because we know A is not in position 3? \n\nPLAID: \n- Position 3: A -> but we cannot put A in position 3 because we know it\'s not correct? Actually, we can put it anywhere? But if we put it in position 3 and it comes back as A again in wrong position (because it is not in position 3 in the secret word) then we learn nothing new? Actually, we can: if we put A in position 3 and it gets marked as (-) meaning in the word but wrong position? Then we know the secret word does not have A in position 3 (which we already know) but also we have A in this position so it would be confusing? \n\nWait, no: the feedback specifies per letter. If the secret word has an A but not in position 3, then when we put A in position 3, it should yield a ""-"" meaning in the word but wrong position? Exactly as before? But that doesn\'t tell us anything new. Actually, we already know A is not in position 3? So we can try a position that might be correct? \n\nBut we don\'t know which position A is in? Only that it is not 3. So we could put A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5? So we have four possibilities? \n\nTherefore, in the next guess, we should try A in one of the other positions, such as 1 or 2 or 4? \n\nTherefore, ""WAIST"" has A in position 2 -> promising because if we get a ✓ then we know A is in position 2? \n\nSimilarly, if we put A in position 1? \n\nGiven we want information, placing A in a new position (not 3) is good. \n\nNow, among ""ABOUT"" and ""WAIST"", both are valid. \n\nBut ""WAIST"" uses W and I? Not as common as T? Actually, ""WAIST"" has T and S? \n\nFrequency-wise, S is one of the most common? \n\nI think ""WAIST"" is a good word? Let me search for something better? \n\nAnother word: ""PAID?"" but 4-letter? Wait, 5-letters: ""PALMS"" -> avoids eliminations? P,A,L,M,S -> yes? A in position 2? \n\nBut ""PALMS"" is common? \n\nLet me stick to ""WAIST""? \n\nBut perhaps a better word is ""SLATE"", but we can\'t because E is eliminated? \n\nGiven the constraints, let me choose ""WAIST"" as the next guess.\n\nWait, but let me confirm available letters: no C,R,N,E? So W,A,I,S,T are clean? Yes? And W, I, T, S are new.\n\nSo we can expect feedback on A (in position 2) and S,T,W,I? At least we\'ll learn about these.\n\nPerhaps choose a word with more common consonants than W? W is less common? But S and T are very common? \n\nWord ""HASTY""? But Y? \n\nI think ""WAIST"" is acceptable? \n\nAlternatively, ""TOAST""? But O? Wait, ""TOAST"": T,O,A,S,T -> repeated T? And A in position 3? Oh position? T O A S T -> position 1:T, 2:O, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T -> A in position 3 -> bad? We must avoid position 3 for A? \n\nSo not both repeated letter and in position 3? \n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""WAIST"". \n\nSo second guess: WAIST\n\nNow, we must format: <guess>waist</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"", we know:\n- A is in the secret word but not in position 3 (marked ""-"").\n- C, R, N, and E are **not** in the word at all (marked ""x"").\n- Therefore, the next guess must include A in a position other than 3 (i.e., position 1, 2, 4, or 5) and avoid using C, R, N, E.\n\nFor optimal information gain, the new guess should:\n- Contain A in a different position than the previous guess (position 3).\n- Use common English letters not yet tested, prioritizing consonants like S, T, L, O, I, etc., which have higher frequency.\n- Avoid repeated letters to maximize letter coverage.\n\nConsidering these constraints, a strong candidate is ""waist"":\n- Places A in position 2 (previously untested position).\n- Introduces new common letters: W, S, I, T (all not eliminated).\n- Avoids position 3 for A and excludes forbidden letters (C, R, N, E).\n- Provides balanced information: tests two vowels (A, I) and three consonants (W, S, T), while targeting a common position for A.\n\nOther options were considered (e.g., ""about"" for position 1 A, ""pasta"" for position 4 A) but ""waist"" uses more frequent consonants (S, T) and avoids repetition or uncommon letters.\n\nThought process summary: Focus on validating A\'s position and uncovering new letters efficiently with ""waist"".\n\n<guess>waist</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: waist -> FEEDBACK: W(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (since it was at position 3 in ""crane"")
- C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: ""waist"" -> W(x), A(✓), I(x), S(x), T(x)
Meaning:
- A is correct and in position 2! (because it was at position 2 and marked ✓)
- W, I, S, T are not in the word.

Combining this knowledge:
- The secret word has the letter A in the second position.
- Letters NOT in the word: C, R, N, E, W, I, S, T.
- We must avoid these letters in future guesses.

Known letters:
- A is confirmed in position 2.

Now, we need to make a third guess that:
- Has A in the second position (since it's fixed).
- Does not contain C, R, N, E, W, I, S, or T.
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.
- Is a valid 5-letter English word.

Available letters: Remaining consonants and vowels not excluded. Excluded letters so far: C, R, N, E, W, I, S, T.

Common English letters remaining: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

Since we have A fixed in position 2, the word pattern is: _ A _ _ _

We need to fill the first, third, fourth, and fifth positions with letters from the remaining set.

To maximize information, we should:
- Choose a word with distinct new letters.
- Cover common remaining letters like L, O, U, M, P, etc.

Given the constraints, some possible words:

Option: ""FABLE"" -> But E is eliminated? E is in the excluded list (from guess 1), so no.
Similarly, ""TABLE"" has T (eliminated) and E -> invalid.

Option: ""AMPLE"" -> E eliminated.

Avoiding eliminated letters, let's think of words that fit _ A _ _ _.

Possible words:
- ""BALMY"": B, A, L, M, Y -> Positions: B in 1? A in 2, L in 3, M in 4, Y in 5? And letters: B, L, M, Y? All from available? Yes: B not excluded, L not, M not, Y not? And A fixed.
But check: B, A, L, M, Y. L and M are allowed? Yes? 
Now, is ""BALMY"" a word? Yes, meaning pleasant weather? E.g., ""balmy breeze"".

Another candidate: ""GAMLY""? Not common. Maybe not valid.
""DALLY""? But L in third? Letters: D, A, L, L, Y? Repeated L? Also, D, A, L, Y. With repeated L? Less ideal for info.

Better to have distinct letters? Yes.

Another word: ""HABIT"" -> But T is eliminated? T is excluded? (from ""waist"" feedback: T(x)), so no.

""JAZZY"" repeated Z? Not good.

""KAPUT""? K, A, P, U, T? T excluded? No? T is excluded? Recall: T(x) in guess 2 -> eliminated? Yes? So ""kaput"" has T? Invalid.

Systematically, we have:

First letter: Can be B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, ...? But after A, need letters? Think of the pattern: first letter must be from available consonants? Not necessarily vowel? 

Common possibilities:

- Third letter: Could be vowel like O, U? Or consonant? 

Words:
- ""BASIC"" but S and C excluded? S excluded? Yes? So no.
- ""BAGGY"" repeated G? Not ideal? Also, Y at end? 
But G available? No S excluded? 

Hmm, let's list:

With A in position 2: Possible? 

- ""LABOR"" but L,A,B,O,R? R is excluded? From guess 1 R(x) -> eliminated.
- ""MAJOR""? M,A,J,O,R? R excluded? Also, O? 
""MAJOR"": R excluded -> invalid.

""PADDY"" double D? Not distinct? Also, Y? And D is available? 

Better: ""POLLY"" double L? No repeated? Also O? But O is available? 

Perhaps: ""FLAKY""? F,L,A,K,Y? Letters: F, L, A, K, Y? All available? (no exclusions? C,R,N,E,W,I,S,T excluded -> F,L,K,Y are clean?) Yes? And distinct letters? Yes? 
""FLAKY"" is valid? Meaning unreliable? Yes, English word.

Similarly, another word: ""QUACK"" -> But Q? And includes C? C excluded? No? 

Alternative: ""GLAMY""? Not standard. 

Another: ""VANED"" but N and E excluded? No? N eliminated? From crane: N(x) -> excluded? So no.

So strong candidate: ""FLAKY""? F-L-A-K-Y? 

Third position: could be critical? Currently? Pattern _ A _ _ _

If we guess ""FLAKY"", feedback on F,L,K,Y? 

But we can consider? Also, Y at end? 

Another option: ""BALKY"" -> B,A,L,K,Y? Similar? 

Both ""FLAKY"" and ""BALKY"" are valid.

Which one to choose? For commonness? Or letter frequency?

Remaining high frequency letters: L,O,U,M,P? Etc.

In ""FLAKY"": F,L,K,Y -> F and K less common? L is common? 

Perhaps include O? 

With O: what words? _ A O _ _

For example: ""MAYOR"" but Y? And M? But R excluded? Also? ""MAJOR"" has R? Excluded? 

""RADIO"" R excluded? 

""GAUZE"" has E excluded? 

""FAUNA"" U? And N excluded? N eliminated? 

""HALLO"" double L? Not distinct? 

""MANGO"" M,A,N,G,O? N excluded? Invalid? 

So, hard to include O? 

Another word ""ABOUT"" but O? But in ""ABOUT"" A is in position 2? But we cannot use T? T excluded? And also U? 
""ABODE"" E excluded? 

Perhaps better to stick with L? 

Let me search for available words: 

Another possibility: ""JUMBO"" but J? And A not in second? 

Not fitting? 

""POLAR"" O? But A in fourth? And R excluded? No? 

We must have A in position 2? 

So, back to: 

""FLAKY"": letters F,L,A,K,Y -> yes? 

Or ""BALKY"": B,A,L,K,Y -> both have L,K,Y? And F or B? 

F is less common? Maybe B is better? 

""HAVOC""? H,A,V,O,C? C and O? But C excluded? C from ""crane"" is x? Eliminated? 

""VALID""? V,A,L,I,D? But I excluded? From ""waist"" I(x)? Eliminated? 

So? ""VALET"" E and T excluded? 

Perhaps ""YODEL"" but no A? Position 2 must be A? 

Stuck? 

Or ""GAWKY"" G,A,W,K,Y? But W excluded? From ""waist"" W(x)? Oh, W eliminated? So ""GAWKY"" invalid? 

Therefore, words without W,I,S,T,C,R,N,E? And A in second? 

So L is remaining? 

Thus, valid words: 

Consider ""BALKY"" : B,A,L,K,Y -> available letters? Yes? And distinct? Yes? 

Similarly ""FLAKY"" : F,A,L,K,Y? 

Both are valid, and we can choose either? 

But note: both end with Y? And positions? 

In ""BALKY"": positions: B1, A2, L3, K4, Y5? 

If secret has L? Or? 

But we are testing key positions? 

Alternative word: ""MADAM"" double M and double A? Not good? Avoid? 

""PAPAL"" repeated P? Also A? Not? 

Hard? Another: ""PADDY"" double D? 

So? 

I think ""BALKY"" or ""FLAKY""? 

Perhaps ""GAMER"" E excluded? 

I found ""QUAGGY"" not length? 

So, better to go with ""BALKY"" or ""FLAKY""? 

Decision: ""BALKY"" uses B which is more common than F? Frequency-wise? In English? F and K less common? 

But Y is also? 

To balance? 

Perhaps choose a word that uses M or P? 

For instance: ""AMPLE"" E excluded? 

""MAPLE"" E? Excluded? 

""LAPEL"" L,A,P,E,L? E excluded? 

""RAPED"" E? 

Okay, difficult? 

Another candidate: ""BADLY"" B,A,D,L,Y? Letters: B,D,L,Y? All available? And A? Yes? Distinct? Yes? 

""BADLY"" - adverb meaning poorly? Valid? Yes? Positions: B1, A2, D3, L4, Y5? 

Similarly? 

Compared to ""BALKY""? 

Both have L? ""BADLY"" has D instead of K? 

D is more common? 

Another: ""DAILY"" I? excluded? 

No? 

""FADED"" repeated D? Avoid? 

Therefore, I will choose ""BADLY"" because it uses common letters B, D, L, Y? And D is a new consonant? 

So next guess: ""BADLY""

But confirm: 
- Positions: 1:B, 2:A, 3:D, 4:L, 5:Y? 
- Avoids excluded letters? C,R,N,E,W,I,S,T? Yes? 
- Includes A fixed in 2? Yes? 

So <guess>badly</guess>? 

But note: with feedback, this tests D in position 3, L in position 4, Y in position 5? 

Alternatively? 

Another word? ""HARDY"" H,A,R,D,Y? R excluded? 

""LARDY"" L,A,R,D,Y? R excluded? 

So ""BADLY"" seems solid? 

Perhaps ""PADDY"" double D? But with D? Let's see if repetition is worth? But less informative? 

So I think ""BADLY"" is good? 

Final choice: ""BADLY""

Therefore, guessed word: badly
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: A is in the word but not in position 3. C, R, N, E are not in the word.
- **Guess 2 (""waist"")**: A is confirmed in position 2! W, I, S, T are not in the word.

**Inferences**:
- The secret word has **A in position 2**: pattern is `_ A _ _ _`.
- Eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, W, I, S, T. Future guesses must avoid these.
- Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

**Strategy for third guess**:
- Keep **A in position 2**.
- Choose a word with distinct, common unused letters to maximize information gain (e.g., focus on consonants like B, D, L, M).
- Avoid eliminated letters and position 3 for A (already known wrong).

Strong candidate: **BADLY** (B1, A2, D3, L4, Y5).  
- Why?  
  - Uses new common consonants (B, D, L) and tests Y.  
  - Avoids repetition and uses high-frequency letters: D and L are among top English frequencies.  
  - Valid word: adjective/adverb meaning ""in a poor or inadequate way"".  
- Expected outcomes:  
  - If B, D, L, or Y get `✓`, their positions are solved.  
  - If `-`, letters are correct but misplaced.  
  - If `x`, letters are eliminated, narrowing options further.  

<guess>badly</guess>",badly,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (since it was at position 3 in ""crane"")
- C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: ""waist"" -> W(x), A(✓), I(x), S(x), T(x)
Meaning:
- A is correct and in position 2! (because it was at position 2 and marked ✓)
- W, I, S, T are not in the word.

Combining this knowledge:
- The secret word has the letter A in the second position.
- Letters NOT in the word: C, R, N, E, W, I, S, T.
- We must avoid these letters in future guesses.

Known letters:
- A is confirmed in position 2.

Now, we need to make a third guess that:
- Has A in the second position (since it's fixed).
- Does not contain C, R, N, E, W, I, S, or T.
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.
- Is a valid 5-letter English word.

Available letters: Remaining consonants and vowels not excluded. Excluded letters so far: C, R, N, E, W, I, S, T.

Common English letters remaining: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

Since we have A fixed in position 2, the word pattern is: _ A _ _ _

We need to fill the first, third, fourth, and fifth positions with letters from the remaining set.

To maximize information, we should:
- Choose a word with distinct new letters.
- Cover common remaining letters like L, O, U, M, P, etc.

Given the constraints, some possible words:

Option: ""FABLE"" -> But E is eliminated? E is in the excluded list (from guess 1), so no.
Similarly, ""TABLE"" has T (eliminated) and E -> invalid.

Option: ""AMPLE"" -> E eliminated.

Avoiding eliminated letters, let's think of words that fit _ A _ _ _.

Possible words:
- ""BALMY"": B, A, L, M, Y -> Positions: B in 1? A in 2, L in 3, M in 4, Y in 5? And letters: B, L, M, Y? All from available? Yes: B not excluded, L not, M not, Y not? And A fixed.
But check: B, A, L, M, Y. L and M are allowed? Yes? 
Now, is ""BALMY"" a word? Yes, meaning pleasant weather? E.g., ""balmy breeze"".

Another candidate: ""GAMLY""? Not common. Maybe not valid.
""DALLY""? But L in third? Letters: D, A, L, L, Y? Repeated L? Also, D, A, L, Y. With repeated L? Less ideal for info.

Better to have distinct letters? Yes.

Another word: ""HABIT"" -> But T is eliminated? T is excluded? (from ""waist"" feedback: T(x)), so no.

""JAZZY"" repeated Z? Not good.

""KAPUT""? K, A, P, U, T? T excluded? No? T is excluded? Recall: T(x) in guess 2 -> eliminated? Yes? So ""kaput"" has T? Invalid.

Systematically, we have:

First letter: Can be B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, ...? But after A, need letters? Think of the pattern: first letter must be from available consonants? Not necessarily vowel? 

Common possibilities:

- Third letter: Could be vowel like O, U? Or consonant? 

Words:
- ""BASIC"" but S and C excluded? S excluded? Yes? So no.
- ""BAGGY"" repeated G? Not ideal? Also, Y at end? 
But G available? No S excluded? 

Hmm, let's list:

With A in position 2: Possible? 

- ""LABOR"" but L,A,B,O,R? R is excluded? From guess 1 R(x) -> eliminated.
- ""MAJOR""? M,A,J,O,R? R excluded? Also, O? 
""MAJOR"": R excluded -> invalid.

""PADDY"" double D? Not distinct? Also, Y? And D is available? 

Better: ""POLLY"" double L? No repeated? Also O? But O is available? 

Perhaps: ""FLAKY""? F,L,A,K,Y? Letters: F, L, A, K, Y? All available? (no exclusions? C,R,N,E,W,I,S,T excluded -> F,L,K,Y are clean?) Yes? And distinct letters? Yes? 
""FLAKY"" is valid? Meaning unreliable? Yes, English word.

Similarly, another word: ""QUACK"" -> But Q? And includes C? C excluded? No? 

Alternative: ""GLAMY""? Not standard. 

Another: ""VANED"" but N and E excluded? No? N eliminated? From crane: N(x) -> excluded? So no.

So strong candidate: ""FLAKY""? F-L-A-K-Y? 

Third position: could be critical? Currently? Pattern _ A _ _ _

If we guess ""FLAKY"", feedback on F,L,K,Y? 

But we can consider? Also, Y at end? 

Another option: ""BALKY"" -> B,A,L,K,Y? Similar? 

Both ""FLAKY"" and ""BALKY"" are valid.

Which one to choose? For commonness? Or letter frequency?

Remaining high frequency letters: L,O,U,M,P? Etc.

In ""FLAKY"": F,L,K,Y -> F and K less common? L is common? 

Perhaps include O? 

With O: what words? _ A O _ _

For example: ""MAYOR"" but Y? And M? But R excluded? Also? ""MAJOR"" has R? Excluded? 

""RADIO"" R excluded? 

""GAUZE"" has E excluded? 

""FAUNA"" U? And N excluded? N eliminated? 

""HALLO"" double L? Not distinct? 

""MANGO"" M,A,N,G,O? N excluded? Invalid? 

So, hard to include O? 

Another word ""ABOUT"" but O? But in ""ABOUT"" A is in position 2? But we cannot use T? T excluded? And also U? 
""ABODE"" E excluded? 

Perhaps better to stick with L? 

Let me search for available words: 

Another possibility: ""JUMBO"" but J? And A not in second? 

Not fitting? 

""POLAR"" O? But A in fourth? And R excluded? No? 

We must have A in position 2? 

So, back to: 

""FLAKY"": letters F,L,A,K,Y -> yes? 

Or ""BALKY"": B,A,L,K,Y -> both have L,K,Y? And F or B? 

F is less common? Maybe B is better? 

""HAVOC""? H,A,V,O,C? C and O? But C excluded? C from ""crane"" is x? Eliminated? 

""VALID""? V,A,L,I,D? But I excluded? From ""waist"" I(x)? Eliminated? 

So? ""VALET"" E and T excluded? 

Perhaps ""YODEL"" but no A? Position 2 must be A? 

Stuck? 

Or ""GAWKY"" G,A,W,K,Y? But W excluded? From ""waist"" W(x)? Oh, W eliminated? So ""GAWKY"" invalid? 

Therefore, words without W,I,S,T,C,R,N,E? And A in second? 

So L is remaining? 

Thus, valid words: 

Consider ""BALKY"" : B,A,L,K,Y -> available letters? Yes? And distinct? Yes? 

Similarly ""FLAKY"" : F,A,L,K,Y? 

Both are valid, and we can choose either? 

But note: both end with Y? And positions? 

In ""BALKY"": positions: B1, A2, L3, K4, Y5? 

If secret has L? Or? 

But we are testing key positions? 

Alternative word: ""MADAM"" double M and double A? Not good? Avoid? 

""PAPAL"" repeated P? Also A? Not? 

Hard? Another: ""PADDY"" double D? 

So? 

I think ""BALKY"" or ""FLAKY""? 

Perhaps ""GAMER"" E excluded? 

I found ""QUAGGY"" not length? 

So, better to go with ""BALKY"" or ""FLAKY""? 

Decision: ""BALKY"" uses B which is more common than F? Frequency-wise? In English? F and K less common? 

But Y is also? 

To balance? 

Perhaps choose a word that uses M or P? 

For instance: ""AMPLE"" E excluded? 

""MAPLE"" E? Excluded? 

""LAPEL"" L,A,P,E,L? E excluded? 

""RAPED"" E? 

Okay, difficult? 

Another candidate: ""BADLY"" B,A,D,L,Y? Letters: B,D,L,Y? All available? And A? Yes? Distinct? Yes? 

""BADLY"" - adverb meaning poorly? Valid? Yes? Positions: B1, A2, D3, L4, Y5? 

Similarly? 

Compared to ""BALKY""? 

Both have L? ""BADLY"" has D instead of K? 

D is more common? 

Another: ""DAILY"" I? excluded? 

No? 

""FADED"" repeated D? Avoid? 

Therefore, I will choose ""BADLY"" because it uses common letters B, D, L, Y? And D is a new consonant? 

So next guess: ""BADLY""

But confirm: 
- Positions: 1:B, 2:A, 3:D, 4:L, 5:Y? 
- Avoids excluded letters? C,R,N,E,W,I,S,T? Yes? 
- Includes A fixed in 2? Yes? 

So <guess>badly</guess>? 

But note: with feedback, this tests D in position 3, L in position 4, Y in position 5? 

Alternatively? 

Another word? ""HARDY"" H,A,R,D,Y? R excluded? 

""LARDY"" L,A,R,D,Y? R excluded? 

So ""BADLY"" seems solid? 

Perhaps ""PADDY"" double D? But with D? Let's see if repetition is worth? But less informative? 

So I think ""BADLY"" is good? 

Final choice: ""BADLY""

Therefore, guessed word: badlyBased on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: A is in the word but not in position 3. C, R, N, E are not in the word.
- **Guess 2 (""waist"")**: A is confirmed in position 2! W, I, S, T are not in the word.

**Inferences**:
- The secret word has **A in position 2**: pattern is `_ A _ _ _`.
- Eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, W, I, S, T. Future guesses must avoid these.
- Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

**Strategy for third guess**:
- Keep **A in position 2**.
- Choose a word with distinct, common unused letters to maximize information gain (e.g., focus on consonants like B, D, L, M).
- Avoid eliminated letters and position 3 for A (already known wrong).

Strong candidate: **BADLY** (B1, A2, D3, L4, Y5).  
- Why?  
  - Uses new common consonants (B, D, L) and tests Y.  
  - Avoids repetition and uses high-frequency letters: D and L are among top English frequencies.  
  - Valid word: adjective/adverb meaning ""in a poor or inadequate way"".  
- Expected outcomes:  
  - If B, D, L, or Y get `✓`, their positions are solved.  
  - If `-`, letters are correct but misplaced.  
  - If `x`, letters are eliminated, narrowing options further.",Guess 3: badly -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) D(x) L(x) Y(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>Alright, let's start with our first guess in Wordle. Since we have no prior feedback, I need to choose a word that maximizes information gain. The best starting words usually contain common letters and avoid repetition. 

Common English letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S. I should pick a word that uses several of these. ""ROATE"" is often recommended as it covers frequent letters like R, O, A, T, E. But after thinking, let me verify: R and T are very common consonants, O and A are common vowels, and E is the most common letter overall. 

Alternative starting words include ""CRANE,"" ""SLATE,"" or ""TRACE."" Each uses five distinct common letters. Among these, ""CRANE"" stands out because:
- C appears in many words though not top tier frequency
- R, A, E are top-10 frequency letters
- N is also relatively common

This covers vowel/consonant balance well. After comparison...For the first guess, selecting a word with diverse and common letters increases chances of hitting relevant letters in the secret word. After considering options like ""ROATE"" (statistically strong), ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"", the latter stands out:  
- Uses 5 distinct high-frequency letters (**C**, **R**, **A**, **N**, **E**)  
- Covers major vowels (**A**, **E**) and versatile consonants  
- Positions letters optimally (e.g., **E** at end matches many words)  

This maximizes initial information for refining subsequent guesses.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": 
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The letter A is in the secret word but not in the third position (since it was the third letter in ""crane"" and marked wrong position).
- The letters C, R, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

We must avoid using C, R, N, E in our next guess.

Moreover, we know that A is present, so we must include A in the new guess, but not in the third position.

For a second guess, we want to try to place A in a different position and use other common letters that we haven't tried yet. We have eliminated 4 letters: C, R, N, E. The remaining available letters are most of the alphabet. We should pick a word that includes A and four new letters that are common to get more information.

Common English letters remaining: S, T, O, I, L, D, U, M, P, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, V, J, X, Q, Z.

We can choose a word that starts with or contains A and avoids the eliminated letters.

We also note that A cannot be in position 3.

Ideally, we place A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Let's think of common words that contain A and four other common letters not in {C,R,N,E}.

Some possibilities:
- Using the letter A and other high frequency letters: S, T, L, I, O, etc.

Word ideas:
- ""SLATE"": but we must avoid E because it was eliminated? Wait, E is eliminated -> x meaning not present, so we cannot use E. ""SLATE"" has E which is eliminated.
- ""PLANT"": has N which is eliminated -> cannot use N.
- ""TRAIL"": has R which is eliminated -> discard.
- ""FLAIL"": has L twice and R? Wait, R is eliminated -> discard.

We need to avoid C, R, N, E.

Let's try words with A and other available letters.

Good words might include ""SAVOR"", ""STOMP"", but they don't have A? We must include A because we know it is in the word.

So, words that have A and avoid C,R,N,E:

Possible words: 
- ""SALAD"" -> but double A? Actually, double A may not be ideal because we don't know if the secret word has two A's. But it's acceptable if we don't have a better word. However, note that in ""SALAD"", A is in position 2 and 4? But we have only one A in the secret word? Actually, we don't know, but for information, using repeated letters is less informative.

Better to try a word with distinct letters and also covering new common letters.

Good candidate: ""PASTA"" -> P,A,S,T,A -> repeated A? Again, same issue.

""PAINT"" -> but N is eliminated -> invalid.

""FAULT"" -> letters: F,A,U,L,T. None of these are in the eliminated set. So: F, A, U, L, T.

But U is not very common? Another word: ""PLAIT"" -> again, has L,T? Wait, A, I, T, etc. But let's avoid uncommon constructs.

""BOAST"" -> B,O,A,S,T. Letters: B,O,A,S,T. All distinct and all new, and avoid eliminated letters.

But note: A must not be in the third position. In ""BOAST"", A is in the third position? 
B O A S T -> A is in position 3? We need to avoid position 3 for A? 
But the feedback says A is in the word but not in the third position. So putting A in third position again might be wasting a spot? However, if we put A in third position and it gets a ✓ then we know the secret word has A in third which contradicts previous feedback? Actually, no: the previous feedback says A is not in third, so if we put A in third and it is marked x then it confirms, but if it gets ✓ that would be impossible? Actually, no because it's a different guess? But the secret word is fixed: we know A is not in the third position, so if we put A in third again and it gets ✓ that would conflict? Therefore, we should avoid position 3 for A.

So in ""BOAST"", A is in position 3 -> not ideal because we know it cannot be there. We need to put A in a different position.

How about:
- Position 1: A? -> e.g., ""ADIEU"" but has E (eliminated) -> invalid.
- Position 2: A? -> e.g., ""HASTY"" -> H,A,S,T,Y -> but H and Y not too common? But acceptable.
- Position 4: A? -> e.g., ""OPALS"" -> O,P,A,L,S -> but note, ""OPALS"" is plural? Maybe acceptable in wordle? Usually allowed if it's a word.

Wordle accepts common nouns, including plurals? But sometimes plurals can be tricky. Let me stick to non-plural.

Another idea: ""STAND"" -> has N (eliminated) -> invalid.
""SHALT"" -> not very common.

A better word: ""PASTY"" -> P,A,S,T,Y -> but A in position 2, and P,S,T,Y are new. This word may be unfamiliar? But it is a word (like the food or resembling paste).

Alternatively: ""MAILS"" -> M,A,I,L,S -> but A in position 2, and it's a common word? M-A-I-L-S. 

But let's systematically think of words that avoid [C,R,N,E] and have A in position not 3.

I recall that starting words like ""AUDIO"" have A and other vowels, but ""AUDIO"" has A in position 1 and avoids our eliminations? Letters: A,U,D,I,O -> no C,R,N,E? Yes.

Moreover, ""AUDIO"" uses vowels and D, but the eliminated letters are consonants? Anyway, it uses new letters.

But we already know A is in the word, so we could try ""AUDIO"" to check multiple vowels. However, it might be better to cover more common consonants.

Another word: ""BAILS"" -> B,A,I,L,S -> A in position 2.

But ""BAILS"" is fine.

Let's list possible words:

Position 1: A
- Words: ""ABIDE"" -> has E -> invalid.
- ""ABOUT"": A,B,O,U,T -> avoids eliminated letters? Yes: A, B, O, U, T -> all clear.

Position 2: A
- ""WAITS"": W,A,I,T,S -> avoids eliminated letters? W,A,I,T,S are not in {C,R,N,E} -> yes.

Position 4: A
- ""FOAMY"": F,O,A,M,Y -> but Y? Valid word? Yes, meaning frothy? Also: ""LOCAL"" has L,O,C,A,L -> C is eliminated -> invalid.

Position 5: A? We can have words ending with A, but that's less common in 5-letter words.

So, strong candidates:

Option 1: ""ABOUT"": A in position 1, and letters: A, B, O, U, T.

Option 2: ""WAIST"": W, A, I, S, T -> A in position 2.

Option 3: ""AUDIO"": A in position 1, U,D,I,O -> checks vowels.

Considering frequency, consonants like T, S, L are more common than U, O. But we also want to cover more frequent letters.

We have already eliminated E and R (which are high frequency), so next are T, O, I, S, etc.

I think ""WAIST"" or ""PASTA"" (but ""PASTA"" has two A's? Let me check: P,A,S,T,A -> repeated A? Actually, letters P,A,S,T -> but spelled P-A-S-T-A so positions: P1: P, P2: A, P3: S, P4: T, P5: A -> so we have two A's? That might be okay, but it reduces diversity.

Avoiding repeated letters is better for information.

So, ""WAIST"": distinct letters: W, A, I, S, T. And T, S are very common.

Similarly, ""ABOUT"" has A,B,O,U,T -> also distinct.

Now, ""AUDIO"": distinct and vowels.

But since we know A is already in the word, testing consonants might yield more information because vowels are less prevalent in positions? 

I think ""WAIST"" is a good choice because it places A in position 2 (not 3) and introduces S, T, W, I. S and T are very common.

Another candidate: ""LASTS"" -> repeated S -> bad.

I think ""WAIST"" is solid.

But let me double-check whether ""WAIST"" is acceptable: it's a word meaning the middle part of the body.

Alternatively, ""CHAOS"" -> but we have C eliminated -> invalid.

Or ""PLAID"" -> but has L and D? Letters: P,L,A,I,D -> avoids eliminations? P,L,A,I,D. Yes. And A is in position 3? Wait, PLAID: P,L,A,I,D -> A in position 3 -> we must avoid that? Yes, because we know A is not in position 3? 

PLAID: 
- Position 3: A -> but we cannot put A in position 3 because we know it's not correct? Actually, we can put it anywhere? But if we put it in position 3 and it comes back as A again in wrong position (because it is not in position 3 in the secret word) then we learn nothing new? Actually, we can: if we put A in position 3 and it gets marked as (-) meaning in the word but wrong position? Then we know the secret word does not have A in position 3 (which we already know) but also we have A in this position so it would be confusing? 

Wait, no: the feedback specifies per letter. If the secret word has an A but not in position 3, then when we put A in position 3, it should yield a ""-"" meaning in the word but wrong position? Exactly as before? But that doesn't tell us anything new. Actually, we already know A is not in position 3? So we can try a position that might be correct? 

But we don't know which position A is in? Only that it is not 3. So we could put A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5? So we have four possibilities? 

Therefore, in the next guess, we should try A in one of the other positions, such as 1 or 2 or 4? 

Therefore, ""WAIST"" has A in position 2 -> promising because if we get a ✓ then we know A is in position 2? 

Similarly, if we put A in position 1? 

Given we want information, placing A in a new position (not 3) is good. 

Now, among ""ABOUT"" and ""WAIST"", both are valid. 

But ""WAIST"" uses W and I? Not as common as T? Actually, ""WAIST"" has T and S? 

Frequency-wise, S is one of the most common? 

I think ""WAIST"" is a good word? Let me search for something better? 

Another word: ""PAID?"" but 4-letter? Wait, 5-letters: ""PALMS"" -> avoids eliminations? P,A,L,M,S -> yes? A in position 2? 

But ""PALMS"" is common? 

Let me stick to ""WAIST""? 

But perhaps a better word is ""SLATE"", but we can't because E is eliminated? 

Given the constraints, let me choose ""WAIST"" as the next guess.

Wait, but let me confirm available letters: no C,R,N,E? So W,A,I,S,T are clean? Yes? And W, I, T, S are new.

So we can expect feedback on A (in position 2) and S,T,W,I? At least we'll learn about these.

Perhaps choose a word with more common consonants than W? W is less common? But S and T are very common? 

Word ""HASTY""? But Y? 

I think ""WAIST"" is acceptable? 

Alternatively, ""TOAST""? But O? Wait, ""TOAST"": T,O,A,S,T -> repeated T? And A in position 3? Oh position? T O A S T -> position 1:T, 2:O, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T -> A in position 3 -> bad? We must avoid position 3 for A? 

So not both repeated letter and in position 3? 

Therefore, I'll go with ""WAIST"". 

So second guess: WAIST

Now, we must format: <guess>waist</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"", we know:
- A is in the secret word but not in position 3 (marked ""-"").
- C, R, N, and E are **not** in the word at all (marked ""x"").
- Therefore, the next guess must include A in a position other than 3 (i.e., position 1, 2, 4, or 5) and avoid using C, R, N, E.

For optimal information gain, the new guess should:
- Contain A in a different position than the previous guess (position 3).
- Use common English letters not yet tested, prioritizing consonants like S, T, L, O, I, etc., which have higher frequency.
- Avoid repeated letters to maximize letter coverage.

Considering these constraints, a strong candidate is ""waist"":
- Places A in position 2 (previously untested position).
- Introduces new common letters: W, S, I, T (all not eliminated).
- Avoids position 3 for A and excludes forbidden letters (C, R, N, E).
- Provides balanced information: tests two vowels (A, I) and three consonants (W, S, T), while targeting a common position for A.

Other options were considered (e.g., ""about"" for position 1 A, ""pasta"" for position 4 A) but ""waist"" uses more frequent consonants (S, T) and avoids repetition or uncommon letters.

Thought process summary: Focus on validating A's position and uncovering new letters efficiently with ""waist"".

<guess>waist</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: waist -> FEEDBACK: W(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (since it was at position 3 in ""crane"")
- C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: ""waist"" -> W(x), A(✓), I(x), S(x), T(x)
Meaning:
- A is correct and in position 2! (because it was at position 2 and marked ✓)
- W, I, S, T are not in the word.

Combining this knowledge:
- The secret word has the letter A in the second position.
- Letters NOT in the word: C, R, N, E, W, I, S, T.
- We must avoid these letters in future guesses.

Known letters:
- A is confirmed in position 2.

Now, we need to make a third guess that:
- Has A in the second position (since it's fixed).
- Does not contain C, R, N, E, W, I, S, or T.
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.
- Is a valid 5-letter English word.

Available letters: Remaining consonants and vowels not excluded. Excluded letters so far: C, R, N, E, W, I, S, T.

Common English letters remaining: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

Since we have A fixed in position 2, the word pattern is: _ A _ _ _

We need to fill the first, third, fourth, and fifth positions with letters from the remaining set.

To maximize information, we should:
- Choose a word with distinct new letters.
- Cover common remaining letters like L, O, U, M, P, etc.

Given the constraints, some possible words:

Option: ""FABLE"" -> But E is eliminated? E is in the excluded list (from guess 1), so no.
Similarly, ""TABLE"" has T (eliminated) and E -> invalid.

Option: ""AMPLE"" -> E eliminated.

Avoiding eliminated letters, let's think of words that fit _ A _ _ _.

Possible words:
- ""BALMY"": B, A, L, M, Y -> Positions: B in 1? A in 2, L in 3, M in 4, Y in 5? And letters: B, L, M, Y? All from available? Yes: B not excluded, L not, M not, Y not? And A fixed.
But check: B, A, L, M, Y. L and M are allowed? Yes? 
Now, is ""BALMY"" a word? Yes, meaning pleasant weather? E.g., ""balmy breeze"".

Another candidate: ""GAMLY""? Not common. Maybe not valid.
""DALLY""? But L in third? Letters: D, A, L, L, Y? Repeated L? Also, D, A, L, Y. With repeated L? Less ideal for info.

Better to have distinct letters? Yes.

Another word: ""HABIT"" -> But T is eliminated? T is excluded? (from ""waist"" feedback: T(x)), so no.

""JAZZY"" repeated Z? Not good.

""KAPUT""? K, A, P, U, T? T excluded? No? T is excluded? Recall: T(x) in guess 2 -> eliminated? Yes? So ""kaput"" has T? Invalid.

Systematically, we have:

First letter: Can be B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, ...? But after A, need letters? Think of the pattern: first letter must be from available consonants? Not necessarily vowel? 

Common possibilities:

- Third letter: Could be vowel like O, U? Or consonant? 

Words:
- ""BASIC"" but S and C excluded? S excluded? Yes? So no.
- ""BAGGY"" repeated G? Not ideal? Also, Y at end? 
But G available? No S excluded? 

Hmm, let's list:

With A in position 2: Possible? 

- ""LABOR"" but L,A,B,O,R? R is excluded? From guess 1 R(x) -> eliminated.
- ""MAJOR""? M,A,J,O,R? R excluded? Also, O? 
""MAJOR"": R excluded -> invalid.

""PADDY"" double D? Not distinct? Also, Y? And D is available? 

Better: ""POLLY"" double L? No repeated? Also O? But O is available? 

Perhaps: ""FLAKY""? F,L,A,K,Y? Letters: F, L, A, K, Y? All available? (no exclusions? C,R,N,E,W,I,S,T excluded -> F,L,K,Y are clean?) Yes? And distinct letters? Yes? 
""FLAKY"" is valid? Meaning unreliable? Yes, English word.

Similarly, another word: ""QUACK"" -> But Q? And includes C? C excluded? No? 

Alternative: ""GLAMY""? Not standard. 

Another: ""VANED"" but N and E excluded? No? N eliminated? From crane: N(x) -> excluded? So no.

So strong candidate: ""FLAKY""? F-L-A-K-Y? 

Third position: could be critical? Currently? Pattern _ A _ _ _

If we guess ""FLAKY"", feedback on F,L,K,Y? 

But we can consider? Also, Y at end? 

Another option: ""BALKY"" -> B,A,L,K,Y? Similar? 

Both ""FLAKY"" and ""BALKY"" are valid.

Which one to choose? For commonness? Or letter frequency?

Remaining high frequency letters: L,O,U,M,P? Etc.

In ""FLAKY"": F,L,K,Y -> F and K less common? L is common? 

Perhaps include O? 

With O: what words? _ A O _ _

For example: ""MAYOR"" but Y? And M? But R excluded? Also? ""MAJOR"" has R? Excluded? 

""RADIO"" R excluded? 

""GAUZE"" has E excluded? 

""FAUNA"" U? And N excluded? N eliminated? 

""HALLO"" double L? Not distinct? 

""MANGO"" M,A,N,G,O? N excluded? Invalid? 

So, hard to include O? 

Another word ""ABOUT"" but O? But in ""ABOUT"" A is in position 2? But we cannot use T? T excluded? And also U? 
""ABODE"" E excluded? 

Perhaps better to stick with L? 

Let me search for available words: 

Another possibility: ""JUMBO"" but J? And A not in second? 

Not fitting? 

""POLAR"" O? But A in fourth? And R excluded? No? 

We must have A in position 2? 

So, back to: 

""FLAKY"": letters F,L,A,K,Y -> yes? 

Or ""BALKY"": B,A,L,K,Y -> both have L,K,Y? And F or B? 

F is less common? Maybe B is better? 

""HAVOC""? H,A,V,O,C? C and O? But C excluded? C from ""crane"" is x? Eliminated? 

""VALID""? V,A,L,I,D? But I excluded? From ""waist"" I(x)? Eliminated? 

So? ""VALET"" E and T excluded? 

Perhaps ""YODEL"" but no A? Position 2 must be A? 

Stuck? 

Or ""GAWKY"" G,A,W,K,Y? But W excluded? From ""waist"" W(x)? Oh, W eliminated? So ""GAWKY"" invalid? 

Therefore, words without W,I,S,T,C,R,N,E? And A in second? 

So L is remaining? 

Thus, valid words: 

Consider ""BALKY"" : B,A,L,K,Y -> available letters? Yes? And distinct? Yes? 

Similarly ""FLAKY"" : F,A,L,K,Y? 

Both are valid, and we can choose either? 

But note: both end with Y? And positions? 

In ""BALKY"": positions: B1, A2, L3, K4, Y5? 

If secret has L? Or? 

But we are testing key positions? 

Alternative word: ""MADAM"" double M and double A? Not good? Avoid? 

""PAPAL"" repeated P? Also A? Not? 

Hard? Another: ""PADDY"" double D? 

So? 

I think ""BALKY"" or ""FLAKY""? 

Perhaps ""GAMER"" E excluded? 

I found ""QUAGGY"" not length? 

So, better to go with ""BALKY"" or ""FLAKY""? 

Decision: ""BALKY"" uses B which is more common than F? Frequency-wise? In English? F and K less common? 

But Y is also? 

To balance? 

Perhaps choose a word that uses M or P? 

For instance: ""AMPLE"" E excluded? 

""MAPLE"" E? Excluded? 

""LAPEL"" L,A,P,E,L? E excluded? 

""RAPED"" E? 

Okay, difficult? 

Another candidate: ""BADLY"" B,A,D,L,Y? Letters: B,D,L,Y? All available? And A? Yes? Distinct? Yes? 

""BADLY"" - adverb meaning poorly? Valid? Yes? Positions: B1, A2, D3, L4, Y5? 

Similarly? 

Compared to ""BALKY""? 

Both have L? ""BADLY"" has D instead of K? 

D is more common? 

Another: ""DAILY"" I? excluded? 

No? 

""FADED"" repeated D? Avoid? 

Therefore, I will choose ""BADLY"" because it uses common letters B, D, L, Y? And D is a new consonant? 

So next guess: ""BADLY""

But confirm: 
- Positions: 1:B, 2:A, 3:D, 4:L, 5:Y? 
- Avoids excluded letters? C,R,N,E,W,I,S,T? Yes? 
- Includes A fixed in 2? Yes? 

So <guess>badly</guess>? 

But note: with feedback, this tests D in position 3, L in position 4, Y in position 5? 

Alternatively? 

Another word? ""HARDY"" H,A,R,D,Y? R excluded? 

""LARDY"" L,A,R,D,Y? R excluded? 

So ""BADLY"" seems solid? 

Perhaps ""PADDY"" double D? But with D? Let's see if repetition is worth? But less informative? 

So I think ""BADLY"" is good? 

Final choice: ""BADLY""

Therefore, guessed word: badlyBased on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: A is in the word but not in position 3. C, R, N, E are not in the word.
- **Guess 2 (""waist"")**: A is confirmed in position 2! W, I, S, T are not in the word.

**Inferences**:
- The secret word has **A in position 2**: pattern is `_ A _ _ _`.
- Eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, W, I, S, T. Future guesses must avoid these.
- Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

**Strategy for third guess**:
- Keep **A in position 2**.
- Choose a word with distinct, common unused letters to maximize information gain (e.g., focus on consonants like B, D, L, M).
- Avoid eliminated letters and position 3 for A (already known wrong).

Strong candidate: **BADLY** (B1, A2, D3, L4, Y5).  
- Why?  
  - Uses new common consonants (B, D, L) and tests Y.  
  - Avoids repetition and uses high-frequency letters: D and L are among top English frequencies.  
  - Valid word: adjective/adverb meaning ""in a poor or inadequate way"".  
- Expected outcomes:  
  - If B, D, L, or Y get `✓`, their positions are solved.  
  - If `-`, letters are correct but misplaced.  
  - If `x`, letters are eliminated, narrowing options further.

Since we have no prior feedback, I need to choose a word that maximizes information gain. The best starting words usually contain common letters and avoid repetition. \n\nCommon English letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S. I should pick a word that uses several of these. ""ROATE"" is often recommended as it covers frequent letters like R, O, A, T, E. But after thinking, let me verify: R and T are very common consonants, O and A are common vowels, and E is the most common letter overall. \n\nAlternative starting words include ""CRANE,"" ""SLATE,"" or ""TRACE."" Each uses five distinct common letters. Among these, ""CRANE"" stands out because:\n- C appears in many words though not top tier frequency\n- R, A, E are top-10 frequency letters\n- N is also relatively common\n\nThis covers vowel/consonant balance well. After comparison...For the first guess, selecting a word with diverse and common letters increases chances of hitting relevant letters in the secret word. After considering options like ""ROATE"" (statistically strong), ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"", the latter stands out:  \n- Uses 5 distinct high-frequency letters (**C**, **R**, **A**, **N**, **E**)  \n- Covers major vowels (**A**, **E**) and versatile consonants  \n- Positions letters optimally (e.g., **E** at end matches many words)  \n\nThis maximizes initial information for refining subsequent guesses.\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": \n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nSo, we know:\n- The letter A is in the secret word but not in the third position (since it was the third letter in ""crane"" and marked wrong position).\n- The letters C, R, N, E are not in the secret word at all.\n\nWe must avoid using C, R, N, E in our next guess.\n\nMoreover, we know that A is present, so we must include A in the new guess, but not in the third position.\n\nFor a second guess, we want to try to place A in a different position and use other common letters that we haven\'t tried yet. We have eliminated 4 letters: C, R, N, E. The remaining available letters are most of the alphabet. We should pick a word that includes A and four new letters that are common to get more information.\n\nCommon English letters remaining: S, T, O, I, L, D, U, M, P, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, V, J, X, Q, Z.\n\nWe can choose a word that starts with or contains A and avoids the eliminated letters.\n\nWe also note that A cannot be in position 3.\n\nIdeally, we place A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\nLet\'s think of common words that contain A and four other common letters not in {C,R,N,E}.\n\nSome possibilities:\n- Using the letter A and other high frequency letters: S, T, L, I, O, etc.\n\nWord ideas:\n- ""SLATE"": but we must avoid E because it was eliminated? Wait, E is eliminated -> x meaning not present, so we cannot use E. ""SLATE"" has E which is eliminated.\n- ""PLANT"": has N which is eliminated -> cannot use N.\n- ""TRAIL"": has R which is eliminated -> discard.\n- ""FLAIL"": has L twice and R? Wait, R is eliminated -> discard.\n\nWe need to avoid C, R, N, E.\n\nLet\'s try words with A and other available letters.\n\nGood words might include ""SAVOR"", ""STOMP"", but they don\'t have A? We must include A because we know it is in the word.\n\nSo, words that have A and avoid C,R,N,E:\n\nPossible words: \n- ""SALAD"" -> but double A? Actually, double A may not be ideal because we don\'t know if the secret word has two A\'s. But it\'s acceptable if we don\'t have a better word. However, note that in ""SALAD"", A is in position 2 and 4? But we have only one A in the secret word? Actually, we don\'t know, but for information, using repeated letters is less informative.\n\nBetter to try a word with distinct letters and also covering new common letters.\n\nGood candidate: ""PASTA"" -> P,A,S,T,A -> repeated A? Again, same issue.\n\n""PAINT"" -> but N is eliminated -> invalid.\n\n""FAULT"" -> letters: F,A,U,L,T. None of these are in the eliminated set. So: F, A, U, L, T.\n\nBut U is not very common? Another word: ""PLAIT"" -> again, has L,T? Wait, A, I, T, etc. But let\'s avoid uncommon constructs.\n\n""BOAST"" -> B,O,A,S,T. Letters: B,O,A,S,T. All distinct and all new, and avoid eliminated letters.\n\nBut note: A must not be in the third position. In ""BOAST"", A is in the third position? \nB O A S T -> A is in position 3? We need to avoid position 3 for A? \nBut the feedback says A is in the word but not in the third position. So putting A in third position again might be wasting a spot? However, if we put A in third position and it gets a ✓ then we know the secret word has A in third which contradicts previous feedback? Actually, no: the previous feedback says A is not in third, so if we put A in third and it is marked x then it confirms, but if it gets ✓ that would be impossible? Actually, no because it\'s a different guess? But the secret word is fixed: we know A is not in the third position, so if we put A in third again and it gets ✓ that would conflict? Therefore, we should avoid position 3 for A.\n\nSo in ""BOAST"", A is in position 3 -> not ideal because we know it cannot be there. We need to put A in a different position.\n\nHow about:\n- Position 1: A? -> e.g., ""ADIEU"" but has E (eliminated) -> invalid.\n- Position 2: A? -> e.g., ""HASTY"" -> H,A,S,T,Y -> but H and Y not too common? But acceptable.\n- Position 4: A? -> e.g., ""OPALS"" -> O,P,A,L,S -> but note, ""OPALS"" is plural? Maybe acceptable in wordle? Usually allowed if it\'s a word.\n\nWordle accepts common nouns, including plurals? But sometimes plurals can be tricky. Let me stick to non-plural.\n\nAnother idea: ""STAND"" -> has N (eliminated) -> invalid.\n""SHALT"" -> not very common.\n\nA better word: ""PASTY"" -> P,A,S,T,Y -> but A in position 2, and P,S,T,Y are new. This word may be unfamiliar? But it is a word (like the food or resembling paste).\n\nAlternatively: ""MAILS"" -> M,A,I,L,S -> but A in position 2, and it\'s a common word? M-A-I-L-S. \n\nBut let\'s systematically think of words that avoid [C,R,N,E] and have A in position not 3.\n\nI recall that starting words like ""AUDIO"" have A and other vowels, but ""AUDIO"" has A in position 1 and avoids our eliminations? Letters: A,U,D,I,O -> no C,R,N,E? Yes.\n\nMoreover, ""AUDIO"" uses vowels and D, but the eliminated letters are consonants? Anyway, it uses new letters.\n\nBut we already know A is in the word, so we could try ""AUDIO"" to check multiple vowels. However, it might be better to cover more common consonants.\n\nAnother word: ""BAILS"" -> B,A,I,L,S -> A in position 2.\n\nBut ""BAILS"" is fine.\n\nLet\'s list possible words:\n\nPosition 1: A\n- Words: ""ABIDE"" -> has E -> invalid.\n- ""ABOUT"": A,B,O,U,T -> avoids eliminated letters? Yes: A, B, O, U, T -> all clear.\n\nPosition 2: A\n- ""WAITS"": W,A,I,T,S -> avoids eliminated letters? W,A,I,T,S are not in {C,R,N,E} -> yes.\n\nPosition 4: A\n- ""FOAMY"": F,O,A,M,Y -> but Y? Valid word? Yes, meaning frothy? Also: ""LOCAL"" has L,O,C,A,L -> C is eliminated -> invalid.\n\nPosition 5: A? We can have words ending with A, but that\'s less common in 5-letter words.\n\nSo, strong candidates:\n\nOption 1: ""ABOUT"": A in position 1, and letters: A, B, O, U, T.\n\nOption 2: ""WAIST"": W, A, I, S, T -> A in position 2.\n\nOption 3: ""AUDIO"": A in position 1, U,D,I,O -> checks vowels.\n\nConsidering frequency, consonants like T, S, L are more common than U, O. But we also want to cover more frequent letters.\n\nWe have already eliminated E and R (which are high frequency), so next are T, O, I, S, etc.\n\nI think ""WAIST"" or ""PASTA"" (but ""PASTA"" has two A\'s? Let me check: P,A,S,T,A -> repeated A? Actually, letters P,A,S,T -> but spelled P-A-S-T-A so positions: P1: P, P2: A, P3: S, P4: T, P5: A -> so we have two A\'s? That might be okay, but it reduces diversity.\n\nAvoiding repeated letters is better for information.\n\nSo, ""WAIST"": distinct letters: W, A, I, S, T. And T, S are very common.\n\nSimilarly, ""ABOUT"" has A,B,O,U,T -> also distinct.\n\nNow, ""AUDIO"": distinct and vowels.\n\nBut since we know A is already in the word, testing consonants might yield more information because vowels are less prevalent in positions? \n\nI think ""WAIST"" is a good choice because it places A in position 2 (not 3) and introduces S, T, W, I. S and T are very common.\n\nAnother candidate: ""LASTS"" -> repeated S -> bad.\n\nI think ""WAIST"" is solid.\n\nBut let me double-check whether ""WAIST"" is acceptable: it\'s a word meaning the middle part of the body.\n\nAlternatively, ""CHAOS"" -> but we have C eliminated -> invalid.\n\nOr ""PLAID"" -> but has L and D? Letters: P,L,A,I,D -> avoids eliminations? P,L,A,I,D. Yes. And A is in position 3? Wait, PLAID: P,L,A,I,D -> A in position 3 -> we must avoid that? Yes, because we know A is not in position 3? \n\nPLAID: \n- Position 3: A -> but we cannot put A in position 3 because we know it\'s not correct? Actually, we can put it anywhere? But if we put it in position 3 and it comes back as A again in wrong position (because it is not in position 3 in the secret word) then we learn nothing new? Actually, we can: if we put A in position 3 and it gets marked as (-) meaning in the word but wrong position? Then we know the secret word does not have A in position 3 (which we already know) but also we have A in this position so it would be confusing? \n\nWait, no: the feedback specifies per letter. If the secret word has an A but not in position 3, then when we put A in position 3, it should yield a ""-"" meaning in the word but wrong position? Exactly as before? But that doesn\'t tell us anything new. Actually, we already know A is not in position 3? So we can try a position that might be correct? \n\nBut we don\'t know which position A is in? Only that it is not 3. So we could put A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5? So we have four possibilities? \n\nTherefore, in the next guess, we should try A in one of the other positions, such as 1 or 2 or 4? \n\nTherefore, ""WAIST"" has A in position 2 -> promising because if we get a ✓ then we know A is in position 2? \n\nSimilarly, if we put A in position 1? \n\nGiven we want information, placing A in a new position (not 3) is good. \n\nNow, among ""ABOUT"" and ""WAIST"", both are valid. \n\nBut ""WAIST"" uses W and I? Not as common as T? Actually, ""WAIST"" has T and S? \n\nFrequency-wise, S is one of the most common? \n\nI think ""WAIST"" is a good word? Let me search for something better? \n\nAnother word: ""PAID?"" but 4-letter? Wait, 5-letters: ""PALMS"" -> avoids eliminations? P,A,L,M,S -> yes? A in position 2? \n\nBut ""PALMS"" is common? \n\nLet me stick to ""WAIST""? \n\nBut perhaps a better word is ""SLATE"", but we can\'t because E is eliminated? \n\nGiven the constraints, let me choose ""WAIST"" as the next guess.\n\nWait, but let me confirm available letters: no C,R,N,E? So W,A,I,S,T are clean? Yes? And W, I, T, S are new.\n\nSo we can expect feedback on A (in position 2) and S,T,W,I? At least we\'ll learn about these.\n\nPerhaps choose a word with more common consonants than W? W is less common? But S and T are very common? \n\nWord ""HASTY""? But Y? \n\nI think ""WAIST"" is acceptable? \n\nAlternatively, ""TOAST""? But O? Wait, ""TOAST"": T,O,A,S,T -> repeated T? And A in position 3? Oh position? T O A S T -> position 1:T, 2:O, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T -> A in position 3 -> bad? We must avoid position 3 for A? \n\nSo not both repeated letter and in position 3? \n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""WAIST"". \n\nSo second guess: WAIST\n\nNow, we must format: <guess>waist</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"", we know:\n- A is in the secret word but not in position 3 (marked ""-"").\n- C, R, N, and E are **not** in the word at all (marked ""x"").\n- Therefore, the next guess must include A in a position other than 3 (i.e., position 1, 2, 4, or 5) and avoid using C, R, N, E.\n\nFor optimal information gain, the new guess should:\n- Contain A in a different position than the previous guess (position 3).\n- Use common English letters not yet tested, prioritizing consonants like S, T, L, O, I, etc., which have higher frequency.\n- Avoid repeated letters to maximize letter coverage.\n\nConsidering these constraints, a strong candidate is ""waist"":\n- Places A in position 2 (previously untested position).\n- Introduces new common letters: W, S, I, T (all not eliminated).\n- Avoids position 3 for A and excludes forbidden letters (C, R, N, E).\n- Provides balanced information: tests two vowels (A, I) and three consonants (W, S, T), while targeting a common position for A.\n\nOther options were considered (e.g., ""about"" for position 1 A, ""pasta"" for position 4 A) but ""waist"" uses more frequent consonants (S, T) and avoids repetition or uncommon letters.\n\nThought process summary: Focus on validating A\'s position and uncovering new letters efficiently with ""waist"".\n\n<guess>waist</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: waist -> FEEDBACK: W(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)\nMeaning:\n- A is in the word but not in position 3 (since it was at position 3 in ""crane"")\n- C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.\n\nGuess 2: ""waist"" -> W(x), A(✓), I(x), S(x), T(x)\nMeaning:\n- A is correct and in position 2!

Excluded? \n\n""LAPEL"" L,A,P,E,L? E excluded? \n\n""RAPED"" E? \n\nOkay, difficult? \n\nAnother candidate: ""BADLY"" B,A,D,L,Y? Letters: B,D,L,Y? All available? And A? Yes? Distinct? Yes? \n\n""BADLY"" - adverb meaning poorly? Valid? Yes? Positions: B1, A2, D3, L4, Y5? \n\nSimilarly? \n\nCompared to ""BALKY""? \n\nBoth have L? ""BADLY"" has D instead of K? \n\nD is more common? \n\nAnother: ""DAILY"" I? excluded? \n\nNo? \n\n""FADED"" repeated D? Avoid? \n\nTherefore, I will choose ""BADLY"" because it uses common letters B, D, L, Y? And D is a new consonant? \n\nSo next guess: ""BADLY""\n\nBut confirm: \n- Positions: 1:B, 2:A, 3:D, 4:L, 5:Y? \n- Avoids excluded letters? C,R,N,E,W,I,S,T? Yes? \n- Includes A fixed in 2? Yes? \n\nSo <guess>badly</guess>? \n\nBut note: with feedback, this tests D in position 3, L in position 4, Y in position 5? \n\nAlternatively? \n\nAnother word? ""HARDY"" H,A,R,D,Y? R excluded? \n\n""LARDY"" L,A,R,D,Y? R excluded? \n\nSo ""BADLY"" seems solid? \n\nPerhaps ""PADDY"" double D? But with D? Let\'s see if repetition is worth? But less informative? \n\nSo I think ""BADLY"" is good? \n\nFinal choice: ""BADLY""\n\nTherefore, guessed word: badlyBased on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: A is in the word but not in position 3.

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
  - A is in the word but not in position 3.
  - C, R, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""waist"" -> W(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) T(x)
  - A is correct and in position 2 (so the word has A as the second letter).
  - W, I, S, T are not in the word.

Guess 3: ""badly"" -> B(x) A(✓) D(x) L(x) Y(✓)
  - A is still correct in position 2 (as expected).
  - Y is correct and in position 5 (so the word ends with Y).
  - B, D, L are not in the word.

Now, combining all feedback:

- The word has the pattern: _ A _ _ Y
- A is in position 2, Y in position 5.
- Eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, W, I, S, T, B, D, L
- We know the word must have two more letters (positions 1 and 3) and one more letter in position 4? Actually, positions 1, 3, and 4? Wait, no: the word is 5 letters: position 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
  - Position 2: A (fixed)
  - Position 5: Y (fixed)
  - Positions 1, 3, and 4 are unknown.

But note: we have eliminated many letters. The remaining letters are from the set: F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Z.

Also, we must consider that the word has exactly 5 letters, and we know two of them (A and Y) and their positions.

Now, we need to find a word that fits: [letter1] A [letter3] [letter4] Y

With letter1, letter3, letter4 from the remaining letters: F,G,H,J,K,M,O,P,Q,U,V,X,Z.

Moreover, we have no information about letter4 yet? But in the pattern, it's the fourth letter.

We must also consider that the word might have repeated letters? But so far, we haven't seen any, but it's possible? However, we have eliminated many, so we can avoid repetition for now.

Now, we need to make a guess that uses letters from the remaining set to test positions 1, 3, and 4.

Common letters remaining: G, H, K, M, O, P, U, V? (F, J, Q, X, Z are less common)

We should try to cover as many common letters as possible in one guess.

Possible words that fit the pattern and use only available letters:

- ""HAPPY"": but H is available? And P? But double P? Also, A is in 2, Y in 5? So H A P P Y? But we have two P's? And we don't know if P is in the word? But we can use it? However, repeated P? Not ideal for information? But if we get feedback, we can learn? But let's see.

But note: we have eliminated B, D, L? So ""HAPPY"" uses H, A, P, P, Y? But A and Y are fixed? So we are testing H in position 1 and P in positions 3 and 4? But repeated P? So if P is in the word, we might get partial feedback? But it's acceptable? However, we might get less information.

Better to avoid repetition? So let's try for distinct letters.

What words? 

- ""GAMMY"": G A M M Y? Double M? Not distinct.

- ""JAMMY"": J A M M Y? Double M? Also, J is less common.

- ""MAYBE"": but E is eliminated? And B eliminated? 

- ""PAPPY"": double P? 

- ""HAPPY"" as above? 

But let's think: 

- ""HAPPY"": H in 1, A in 2, P in 3, P in 4, Y in 5? 

But we don't know if P is in the word? 

Alternatively, ""GASSY"": but S eliminated? 

""HAVOC"": H A V O C? But C eliminated? 

""JAZZY"": double Z? 

""MAUVE"": M A U V E? E eliminated? 

""PADDY"": D eliminated? 

""FANNY"": F A N N Y? N eliminated? 

""JAGGY"": J A G G Y? Double G? 

""KAPPA"": K A P P A? Double P and A? But A is already known? And we don't know if A is repeated? But in position 1? But we have A in 2? So if we put A in 1? But we know A is in 2? So if we put A in 1, it would be marked as (-) if present? But we know it's in 2? So putting A in 1 would be wrong? And we know it's not in 1? Because it's in 2? Actually, we don't know if there is another A? But from feedback, we only know one A? But it could be repeated? 

But in ""badly"", we had A in 2 and it was ✓, and we didn't test other positions? So it's possible? 

But to avoid complexity, let's assume no repetition for now? 

So, words with distinct letters? 

Pattern: [1] A [3] [4] Y

Available letters: F,G,H,J,K,M,O,P,Q,U,V,X,Z

Try to form a word? 

- ""HAPPY"" has repeated P? 

- ""GAMMY"" repeated M? 

- ""JUMBO"" but no Y? 

- ""HUMAN"" N eliminated? 

- ""GAYAL"" G A Y A L? But Y is in 5? And A in 2? So G A Y A L? That would be positions: 1:G, 2:A, 3:Y? But Y is fixed at 5? So conflict? 

We need Y at 5? 

So, ""GAYLY""? G A Y L Y? But Y at 3 and 5? And L? But L eliminated? 

Not? 

""JOKEY"": J O K E Y? E eliminated? 

""POKEY"": P O K E Y? E eliminated? 

""MAKEY""? Not a word? 

""FOGGY"": double G? 

""BUGGY"": double G? 

""MUMMY"": double M? 

""PUPPY"": double P? 

It's hard to find a word with distinct letters? 

Perhaps ""HAVOC"" but C eliminated? 

""JACKY"": C and K? But C eliminated? 

""QUACK"": C eliminated? 

""QUAFF"": Q U A F F? Double F? 

""QUAGY""? Not a word? 

""VAGUE"": G U? But E eliminated? 

""VAMPY""? Not common? 

""WACKY"": W eliminated? 

So, maybe we have to accept a word with repeated letters? 

Another idea: ""HAPPY"" is a common word? 

But let's see if there is a word without repetition? 

""GAZPY""? Not a word? 

""KAPOK"": K A P O K? But K repeated? 

""MAVIE""? Not? 

""PAVKY""? Not? 

""OAKUM"": O A K U M? But O in 1? A in 2? K in 3? U in 4? M in 5? But we need Y in 5? So not? 

We need Y at 5? 

So, the word must end with Y? 

Therefore, position 4 must be a letter that can come before Y? 

Commonly? 

For example: ""HAPPY"" has P before Y? 

""FUNKY"": F U N K Y? N eliminated? 

""JUMPY"": J U M P Y? This is a word? Meaning nervous? Yes? 

Letters: J, U, M, P, Y? All available? And distinct? 

Yes! J, U, M, P, Y? 

And pattern: J A? Wait, no: we have to put A in 2? 

""JUMPY"" is J U M P Y? But we need A in position 2? 

So we cannot use ""JUMPY"" because it doesn't have A? 

We must have A in position 2? 

So the word is: [1] A [3] [4] Y

So we need a word that has A in second and Y in fifth? 

""JUMPY"" doesn't have A? 

So not? 

Another word: ""GIPSY"": G I P S Y? But I and S eliminated? 

""TIPSY"": T and S eliminated? 

""POPPY"": double P? 

""DUMPY"": D eliminated? 

""GUPPY"": G U P P Y? Double P? 

""HUMPY"": H U M P Y? But M and P? And H? 

But ""HUMPY"" is a word? Meaning having humps? Yes? 

But pattern: H U M P Y? But we need A in position 2? So not? 

We must have A in position 2? 

So, let's list possible words that fit _ A _ _ Y and use available letters? 

- ""HAPPY"": H A P P Y? Uses H, P? And repeated P? 

- ""JAPAN"": J A P A N? But N eliminated? 

- ""KAPPA"": K A P P A? Double P and A? 

- ""PAPAY"": not a word? 

- ""QADDI"": not? 

- ""RABBY"": R eliminated? 

- ""SABBY"": S eliminated? 

- ""TABBY"": T eliminated? 

- ""HABIT"": H A B I T? B and I and T eliminated? 

- ""FADDY"": F A D D Y? D eliminated? 

- ""GADDY"": G A D D Y? D eliminated? 

- ""LADDY"": L and D eliminated? 

- ""MADLY"": M A D L Y? D and L eliminated? 

- ""PALLY"": P A L L Y? L eliminated? 

- ""RALLY"": R and L eliminated? 

- ""SALLY"": S and L eliminated? 

- ""TALLY"": T and L eliminated? 

- ""WALLY"": W and L eliminated? 

- ""FANNY"": F A N N Y? N eliminated? 

- ""CANNY"": C and N eliminated? 

- ""FUNNY"": F U N N Y? N eliminated? 

- ""GUNNY"": G U N N Y? N eliminated? 

- ""HONEY"": H O N E Y? N and E eliminated? 

- ""MONEY"": M O N E Y? N and E eliminated? 

- ""PINEY"": P I N E Y? I, N, E eliminated? 

- ""VINNY"": V I N N Y? I and N eliminated? 

- ""BAGGY"": B and G? B eliminated? 

- ""CABBY"": C and B eliminated? 

- ""DADDY"": D eliminated? 

- ""JAGGY"": J A G G Y? Double G? 

- ""JAZZY"": J A Z Z Y? Double Z? 

- ""KARMA"": K A R M A? R eliminated? 

- ""MANGA"": M A N G A? N eliminated? 

- ""PAGAN"": P A G A N? N eliminated? 

- ""VAGAL"": V A G A L? L eliminated? 

- ""WAGON"": W and G? W eliminated? 

- ""YAHOO"": Y A H O O? But Y is at 1? But we need Y at 5? 

So, after this, it seems ""HAPPY"" is a possible word? 

But we have not eliminated H or P? 

Another word: ""GAUPY""? Not a word? 

""JAUKY""? J A U K Y? This is a word? Meaning shy? Rare? 

""MAUZY""? Not? 

""PAUKY""? P A U K Y? Meaning cunning? Scottish? 

But let's stick to common words? 

""HAZY"": only 4 letters? 

""HAYEY""? H A Y E Y? But E eliminated? And Y at 3? 

Not? 

So, perhaps ""HAPPY"" is the most common? 

But we have to consider that P might be repeated? 

Another common word: ""GASSY"" but S eliminated? 

""NASTY"" N and S and T eliminated? 

So, I think we have to go with ""HAPPY"" or similar? 

But note: in ""HAPPY"", we are testing H in position 1 and P in positions 3 and 4? 

If we guess ""HAPPY"", and if the word is ""HAPPY"", we win? 

But if not, we get feedback on H and P? 

For example, if H is not in the word, it will be x? And P? If P is in the word, we might get - or ✓ for the positions? 

But since we have two P's, if one P is correct, we get one ✓ and one -? Or if both wrong, then x? 

But it's acceptable? 

To avoid repetition, is there a word with distinct letters? 

Let me try: ""JAMBU""? Not? 

""KAMIK"": K A M I K? I eliminated? 

""MAHOE"": M A H O E? E eliminated? 

""PAGLE""? Not? 

""QUAHAUG"": too long? 

""QUAKY"": Q U A K Y? But U in position 2? But we need A in 2? So ""Q U A K Y"" has U in 1, A in 2, K in 3, Y in 4? But we need 5 letters? ""QUAKY"" is 5: Q-U-A-K-Y? Positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:A, 4:K, 5:Y? But we need A in position 2? Here A is in position 3? So not? 

We need A in position 2? 

So, ""QUAKY"" has A in 3? Not 2? 

Another: ""GAWKY"": G A W K Y? But W eliminated? 

So, I think we have to use a word with repeated letters? 

But let's try ""HAPPY"" for now? 

But there is ""HANKY"": H A N K Y? N eliminated? 

""PARKY"": P A R K Y? R eliminated? 

""FJORD"": no A? 

So, I think ""HAPPY"" is a valid guess? 

But let's see if there is a word like ""HAPPY"" but without repetition? 

""HAVOC"" not? 

""JACKY"" not? 

""PADDY"" not? 

""GAFFY"": G A F F Y? Double F? 

""GAFFY"" is a word? Meaning hook? Rare? 

""JAFFA"": J A F F A? Double F and A? 

Not distinct? 

So, I will go with ""HAPPY"" as the next guess? 

But note: we have not used M, O, U, V, etc.? 

Another word: ""HUMOR"" no Y? 

""MAYOR"" M A Y O R? But Y in 3? And R eliminated? 

Not? 

""PUDGY"" P U D G Y? D eliminated? 

So, ""HAPPY"" seems the best option? 

Therefore, fourth guess: ""HAPPY"" 

But let's format: <guess>happy</guess> 

But we have to be careful: if the word is not ""HAPPY"", we get feedback? 

For example, if H is not in the word, and P is not, then we get all x except A and Y? 

But then we have to try other letters? 

But we have only 3 guesses left? 

We have used 3, so this is the fourth? 

But let's proceed? 

Perhaps there is a better word? 

Another idea: ""JUMPY"" is not possible? 

Or ""GAMMY"" double M? 

But ""GAMMY"" is a word? Meaning lame? 

G A M M Y? Pattern: G1, A2, M3, M4, Y5? 

But repeated M? 

Similarly, ""HAPPY"" has repeated P? 

But both are similar? 

I think ""HAPPY"" is more common? 

So I'll go with that.
</think>
### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
  - Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
    - A is in the word but not in position 3.  
    - C, R, N, E are eliminated (not in the word).  

- **Guess 2: ""waist""**  
  - Feedback: W(x), A(✓), I(x), S(x), T(x)  
    - A is confirmed in position 2.  
    - W, I, S, T are eliminated.  

- **Guess 3: ""badly""**  
  - Feedback: B(x), A(✓), D(x), L(x), Y(✓)  
    - A is confirmed in position 2 (redundant but consistent).  
    - Y is confirmed in position 5.  
    - B, D, L are eliminated.  

### Key Inferences
- **Word pattern**: The secret word must be `_ A _ _ Y` (A in position 2, Y in position 5).  
- **Eliminated letters (13 total)**: C, R, N, E, W, I, S, T, B, D, L.  
- **Available letters (13 remaining)**: F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Z.  
- **Constraints for next guess**:  
  - Must include A in position 2 and Y in position 5.  
  - Positions 1, 3, and 4 must use letters from the available set.  
  - Avoid eliminated letters.  
- **Strategy for Guess 4**:  
  - Prioritize common letters from the available set (e.g., H, P, M, K, G) to maximize information.  
  - Test multiple positions (1, 3, 4) simultaneously.  
  - Given the limited options, repetition may be unavoidable, but distinct letters are preferred for better information gain.  
  - After evaluating possible words (e.g., ""happy"", ""gamy"", ""jumpy""), ""happy"" is selected because:  
    - It uses common letters (H, P).  
    - It tests H in position 1 and P in positions 3 and 4 (repetition is necessary due to word constraints).  
    - If ""happy"" is incorrect, feedback on H and P will significantly narrow possibilities (e.g., if P is correct, it reveals position; if not, P is eliminated).  
    - It is a valid English word.  

### Next Guess: ""happy""  
- **Pattern**: H (position 1), A (position 2), P (position 3), P (position 4), Y (position 5).  
- **Expected outcomes**:  
  - If H is `✓`, position 1 is solved. If `x`, H is eliminated.  
  - If P is `✓` in position 3 or 4, that position is solved. If `-`, P is in the word but misplaced. If `x`, P is eliminated.  
  - Feedback will reduce the solution space for the final guess(es).  

<guess>happy</guess>",happy,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
  - A is in the word but not in position 3.
  - C, R, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""waist"" -> W(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) T(x)
  - A is correct and in position 2 (so the word has A as the second letter).
  - W, I, S, T are not in the word.

Guess 3: ""badly"" -> B(x) A(✓) D(x) L(x) Y(✓)
  - A is still correct in position 2 (as expected).
  - Y is correct and in position 5 (so the word ends with Y).
  - B, D, L are not in the word.

Now, combining all feedback:

- The word has the pattern: _ A _ _ Y
- A is in position 2, Y in position 5.
- Eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, W, I, S, T, B, D, L
- We know the word must have two more letters (positions 1 and 3) and one more letter in position 4? Actually, positions 1, 3, and 4? Wait, no: the word is 5 letters: position 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
  - Position 2: A (fixed)
  - Position 5: Y (fixed)
  - Positions 1, 3, and 4 are unknown.

But note: we have eliminated many letters. The remaining letters are from the set: F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Z.

Also, we must consider that the word has exactly 5 letters, and we know two of them (A and Y) and their positions.

Now, we need to find a word that fits: [letter1] A [letter3] [letter4] Y

With letter1, letter3, letter4 from the remaining letters: F,G,H,J,K,M,O,P,Q,U,V,X,Z.

Moreover, we have no information about letter4 yet? But in the pattern, it's the fourth letter.

We must also consider that the word might have repeated letters? But so far, we haven't seen any, but it's possible? However, we have eliminated many, so we can avoid repetition for now.

Now, we need to make a guess that uses letters from the remaining set to test positions 1, 3, and 4.

Common letters remaining: G, H, K, M, O, P, U, V? (F, J, Q, X, Z are less common)

We should try to cover as many common letters as possible in one guess.

Possible words that fit the pattern and use only available letters:

- ""HAPPY"": but H is available? And P? But double P? Also, A is in 2, Y in 5? So H A P P Y? But we have two P's? And we don't know if P is in the word? But we can use it? However, repeated P? Not ideal for information? But if we get feedback, we can learn? But let's see.

But note: we have eliminated B, D, L? So ""HAPPY"" uses H, A, P, P, Y? But A and Y are fixed? So we are testing H in position 1 and P in positions 3 and 4? But repeated P? So if P is in the word, we might get partial feedback? But it's acceptable? However, we might get less information.

Better to avoid repetition? So let's try for distinct letters.

What words? 

- ""GAMMY"": G A M M Y? Double M? Not distinct.

- ""JAMMY"": J A M M Y? Double M? Also, J is less common.

- ""MAYBE"": but E is eliminated? And B eliminated? 

- ""PAPPY"": double P? 

- ""HAPPY"" as above? 

But let's think: 

- ""HAPPY"": H in 1, A in 2, P in 3, P in 4, Y in 5? 

But we don't know if P is in the word? 

Alternatively, ""GASSY"": but S eliminated? 

""HAVOC"": H A V O C? But C eliminated? 

""JAZZY"": double Z? 

""MAUVE"": M A U V E? E eliminated? 

""PADDY"": D eliminated? 

""FANNY"": F A N N Y? N eliminated? 

""JAGGY"": J A G G Y? Double G? 

""KAPPA"": K A P P A? Double P and A? But A is already known? And we don't know if A is repeated? But in position 1? But we have A in 2? So if we put A in 1? But we know A is in 2? So if we put A in 1, it would be marked as (-) if present? But we know it's in 2? So putting A in 1 would be wrong? And we know it's not in 1? Because it's in 2? Actually, we don't know if there is another A? But from feedback, we only know one A? But it could be repeated? 

But in ""badly"", we had A in 2 and it was ✓, and we didn't test other positions? So it's possible? 

But to avoid complexity, let's assume no repetition for now? 

So, words with distinct letters? 

Pattern: [1] A [3] [4] Y

Available letters: F,G,H,J,K,M,O,P,Q,U,V,X,Z

Try to form a word? 

- ""HAPPY"" has repeated P? 

- ""GAMMY"" repeated M? 

- ""JUMBO"" but no Y? 

- ""HUMAN"" N eliminated? 

- ""GAYAL"" G A Y A L? But Y is in 5? And A in 2? So G A Y A L? That would be positions: 1:G, 2:A, 3:Y? But Y is fixed at 5? So conflict? 

We need Y at 5? 

So, ""GAYLY""? G A Y L Y? But Y at 3 and 5? And L? But L eliminated? 

Not? 

""JOKEY"": J O K E Y? E eliminated? 

""POKEY"": P O K E Y? E eliminated? 

""MAKEY""? Not a word? 

""FOGGY"": double G? 

""BUGGY"": double G? 

""MUMMY"": double M? 

""PUPPY"": double P? 

It's hard to find a word with distinct letters? 

Perhaps ""HAVOC"" but C eliminated? 

""JACKY"": C and K? But C eliminated? 

""QUACK"": C eliminated? 

""QUAFF"": Q U A F F? Double F? 

""QUAGY""? Not a word? 

""VAGUE"": G U? But E eliminated? 

""VAMPY""? Not common? 

""WACKY"": W eliminated? 

So, maybe we have to accept a word with repeated letters? 

Another idea: ""HAPPY"" is a common word? 

But let's see if there is a word without repetition? 

""GAZPY""? Not a word? 

""KAPOK"": K A P O K? But K repeated? 

""MAVIE""? Not? 

""PAVKY""? Not? 

""OAKUM"": O A K U M? But O in 1? A in 2? K in 3? U in 4? M in 5? But we need Y in 5? So not? 

We need Y at 5? 

So, the word must end with Y? 

Therefore, position 4 must be a letter that can come before Y? 

Commonly? 

For example: ""HAPPY"" has P before Y? 

""FUNKY"": F U N K Y? N eliminated? 

""JUMPY"": J U M P Y? This is a word? Meaning nervous? Yes? 

Letters: J, U, M, P, Y? All available? And distinct? 

Yes! J, U, M, P, Y? 

And pattern: J A? Wait, no: we have to put A in 2? 

""JUMPY"" is J U M P Y? But we need A in position 2? 

So we cannot use ""JUMPY"" because it doesn't have A? 

We must have A in position 2? 

So the word is: [1] A [3] [4] Y

So we need a word that has A in second and Y in fifth? 

""JUMPY"" doesn't have A? 

So not? 

Another word: ""GIPSY"": G I P S Y? But I and S eliminated? 

""TIPSY"": T and S eliminated? 

""POPPY"": double P? 

""DUMPY"": D eliminated? 

""GUPPY"": G U P P Y? Double P? 

""HUMPY"": H U M P Y? But M and P? And H? 

But ""HUMPY"" is a word? Meaning having humps? Yes? 

But pattern: H U M P Y? But we need A in position 2? So not? 

We must have A in position 2? 

So, let's list possible words that fit _ A _ _ Y and use available letters? 

- ""HAPPY"": H A P P Y? Uses H, P? And repeated P? 

- ""JAPAN"": J A P A N? But N eliminated? 

- ""KAPPA"": K A P P A? Double P and A? 

- ""PAPAY"": not a word? 

- ""QADDI"": not? 

- ""RABBY"": R eliminated? 

- ""SABBY"": S eliminated? 

- ""TABBY"": T eliminated? 

- ""HABIT"": H A B I T? B and I and T eliminated? 

- ""FADDY"": F A D D Y? D eliminated? 

- ""GADDY"": G A D D Y? D eliminated? 

- ""LADDY"": L and D eliminated? 

- ""MADLY"": M A D L Y? D and L eliminated? 

- ""PALLY"": P A L L Y? L eliminated? 

- ""RALLY"": R and L eliminated? 

- ""SALLY"": S and L eliminated? 

- ""TALLY"": T and L eliminated? 

- ""WALLY"": W and L eliminated? 

- ""FANNY"": F A N N Y? N eliminated? 

- ""CANNY"": C and N eliminated? 

- ""FUNNY"": F U N N Y? N eliminated? 

- ""GUNNY"": G U N N Y? N eliminated? 

- ""HONEY"": H O N E Y? N and E eliminated? 

- ""MONEY"": M O N E Y? N and E eliminated? 

- ""PINEY"": P I N E Y? I, N, E eliminated? 

- ""VINNY"": V I N N Y? I and N eliminated? 

- ""BAGGY"": B and G? B eliminated? 

- ""CABBY"": C and B eliminated? 

- ""DADDY"": D eliminated? 

- ""JAGGY"": J A G G Y? Double G? 

- ""JAZZY"": J A Z Z Y? Double Z? 

- ""KARMA"": K A R M A? R eliminated? 

- ""MANGA"": M A N G A? N eliminated? 

- ""PAGAN"": P A G A N? N eliminated? 

- ""VAGAL"": V A G A L? L eliminated? 

- ""WAGON"": W and G? W eliminated? 

- ""YAHOO"": Y A H O O? But Y is at 1? But we need Y at 5? 

So, after this, it seems ""HAPPY"" is a possible word? 

But we have not eliminated H or P? 

Another word: ""GAUPY""? Not a word? 

""JAUKY""? J A U K Y? This is a word? Meaning shy? Rare? 

""MAUZY""? Not? 

""PAUKY""? P A U K Y? Meaning cunning? Scottish? 

But let's stick to common words? 

""HAZY"": only 4 letters? 

""HAYEY""? H A Y E Y? But E eliminated? And Y at 3? 

Not? 

So, perhaps ""HAPPY"" is the most common? 

But we have to consider that P might be repeated? 

Another common word: ""GASSY"" but S eliminated? 

""NASTY"" N and S and T eliminated? 

So, I think we have to go with ""HAPPY"" or similar? 

But note: in ""HAPPY"", we are testing H in position 1 and P in positions 3 and 4? 

If we guess ""HAPPY"", and if the word is ""HAPPY"", we win? 

But if not, we get feedback on H and P? 

For example, if H is not in the word, it will be x? And P? If P is in the word, we might get - or ✓ for the positions? 

But since we have two P's, if one P is correct, we get one ✓ and one -? Or if both wrong, then x? 

But it's acceptable? 

To avoid repetition, is there a word with distinct letters? 

Let me try: ""JAMBU""? Not? 

""KAMIK"": K A M I K? I eliminated? 

""MAHOE"": M A H O E? E eliminated? 

""PAGLE""? Not? 

""QUAHAUG"": too long? 

""QUAKY"": Q U A K Y? But U in position 2? But we need A in 2? So ""Q U A K Y"" has U in 1, A in 2, K in 3, Y in 4? But we need 5 letters? ""QUAKY"" is 5: Q-U-A-K-Y? Positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:A, 4:K, 5:Y? But we need A in position 2? Here A is in position 3? So not? 

We need A in position 2? 

So, ""QUAKY"" has A in 3? Not 2? 

Another: ""GAWKY"": G A W K Y? But W eliminated? 

So, I think we have to use a word with repeated letters? 

But let's try ""HAPPY"" for now? 

But there is ""HANKY"": H A N K Y? N eliminated? 

""PARKY"": P A R K Y? R eliminated? 

""FJORD"": no A? 

So, I think ""HAPPY"" is a valid guess? 

But let's see if there is a word like ""HAPPY"" but without repetition? 

""HAVOC"" not? 

""JACKY"" not? 

""PADDY"" not? 

""GAFFY"": G A F F Y? Double F? 

""GAFFY"" is a word? Meaning hook? Rare? 

""JAFFA"": J A F F A? Double F and A? 

Not distinct? 

So, I will go with ""HAPPY"" as the next guess? 

But note: we have not used M, O, U, V, etc.? 

Another word: ""HUMOR"" no Y? 

""MAYOR"" M A Y O R? But Y in 3? And R eliminated? 

Not? 

""PUDGY"" P U D G Y? D eliminated? 

So, ""HAPPY"" seems the best option? 

Therefore, fourth guess: ""HAPPY"" 

But let's format: <guess>happy</guess> 

But we have to be careful: if the word is not ""HAPPY"", we get feedback? 

For example, if H is not in the word, and P is not, then we get all x except A and Y? 

But then we have to try other letters? 

But we have only 3 guesses left? 

We have used 3, so this is the fourth? 

But let's proceed? 

Perhaps there is a better word? 

Another idea: ""JUMPY"" is not possible? 

Or ""GAMMY"" double M? 

But ""GAMMY"" is a word? Meaning lame? 

G A M M Y? Pattern: G1, A2, M3, M4, Y5? 

But repeated M? 

Similarly, ""HAPPY"" has repeated P? 

But both are similar? 

I think ""HAPPY"" is more common? 

So I'll go with that.### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
  - Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
    - A is in the word but not in position 3.  
    - C, R, N, E are eliminated (not in the word).  

- **Guess 2: ""waist""**  
  - Feedback: W(x), A(✓), I(x), S(x), T(x)  
    - A is confirmed in position 2.  
    - W, I, S, T are eliminated.  

- **Guess 3: ""badly""**  
  - Feedback: B(x), A(✓), D(x), L(x), Y(✓)  
    - A is confirmed in position 2 (redundant but consistent).  
    - Y is confirmed in position 5.  
    - B, D, L are eliminated.  

### Key Inferences
- **Word pattern**: The secret word must be `_ A _ _ Y` (A in position 2, Y in position 5).  
- **Eliminated letters (13 total)**: C, R, N, E, W, I, S, T, B, D, L.  
- **Available letters (13 remaining)**: F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Z.  
- **Constraints for next guess**:  
  - Must include A in position 2 and Y in position 5.  
  - Positions 1, 3, and 4 must use letters from the available set.  
  - Avoid eliminated letters.  
- **Strategy for Guess 4**:  
  - Prioritize common letters from the available set (e.g., H, P, M, K, G) to maximize information.  
  - Test multiple positions (1, 3, 4) simultaneously.  
  - Given the limited options, repetition may be unavoidable, but distinct letters are preferred for better information gain.  
  - After evaluating possible words (e.g., ""happy"", ""gamy"", ""jumpy""), ""happy"" is selected because:  
    - It uses common letters (H, P).  
    - It tests H in position 1 and P in positions 3 and 4 (repetition is necessary due to word constraints).  
    - If ""happy"" is incorrect, feedback on H and P will significantly narrow possibilities (e.g., if P is correct, it reveals position; if not, P is eliminated).  
    - It is a valid English word.  

### Next Guess: ""happy""  
- **Pattern**: H (position 1), A (position 2), P (position 3), P (position 4), Y (position 5).  
- **Expected outcomes**:  
  - If H is `✓`, position 1 is solved. If `x`, H is eliminated.  
  - If P is `✓` in position 3 or 4, that position is solved. If `-`, P is in the word but misplaced. If `x`, P is eliminated.  
  - Feedback will reduce the solution space for the final guess(es).",Guess 4: happy -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) P(x) P(x) Y(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>Alright, let's start with our first guess in Wordle. Since we have no prior feedback, I need to choose a word that maximizes information gain. The best starting words usually contain common letters and avoid repetition. 

Common English letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S. I should pick a word that uses several of these. ""ROATE"" is often recommended as it covers frequent letters like R, O, A, T, E. But after thinking, let me verify: R and T are very common consonants, O and A are common vowels, and E is the most common letter overall. 

Alternative starting words include ""CRANE,"" ""SLATE,"" or ""TRACE."" Each uses five distinct common letters. Among these, ""CRANE"" stands out because:
- C appears in many words though not top tier frequency
- R, A, E are top-10 frequency letters
- N is also relatively common

This covers vowel/consonant balance well. After comparison...For the first guess, selecting a word with diverse and common letters increases chances of hitting relevant letters in the secret word. After considering options like ""ROATE"" (statistically strong), ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"", the latter stands out:  
- Uses 5 distinct high-frequency letters (**C**, **R**, **A**, **N**, **E**)  
- Covers major vowels (**A**, **E**) and versatile consonants  
- Positions letters optimally (e.g., **E** at end matches many words)  

This maximizes initial information for refining subsequent guesses.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": 
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The letter A is in the secret word but not in the third position (since it was the third letter in ""crane"" and marked wrong position).
- The letters C, R, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

We must avoid using C, R, N, E in our next guess.

Moreover, we know that A is present, so we must include A in the new guess, but not in the third position.

For a second guess, we want to try to place A in a different position and use other common letters that we haven't tried yet. We have eliminated 4 letters: C, R, N, E. The remaining available letters are most of the alphabet. We should pick a word that includes A and four new letters that are common to get more information.

Common English letters remaining: S, T, O, I, L, D, U, M, P, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, V, J, X, Q, Z.

We can choose a word that starts with or contains A and avoids the eliminated letters.

We also note that A cannot be in position 3.

Ideally, we place A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Let's think of common words that contain A and four other common letters not in {C,R,N,E}.

Some possibilities:
- Using the letter A and other high frequency letters: S, T, L, I, O, etc.

Word ideas:
- ""SLATE"": but we must avoid E because it was eliminated? Wait, E is eliminated -> x meaning not present, so we cannot use E. ""SLATE"" has E which is eliminated.
- ""PLANT"": has N which is eliminated -> cannot use N.
- ""TRAIL"": has R which is eliminated -> discard.
- ""FLAIL"": has L twice and R? Wait, R is eliminated -> discard.

We need to avoid C, R, N, E.

Let's try words with A and other available letters.

Good words might include ""SAVOR"", ""STOMP"", but they don't have A? We must include A because we know it is in the word.

So, words that have A and avoid C,R,N,E:

Possible words: 
- ""SALAD"" -> but double A? Actually, double A may not be ideal because we don't know if the secret word has two A's. But it's acceptable if we don't have a better word. However, note that in ""SALAD"", A is in position 2 and 4? But we have only one A in the secret word? Actually, we don't know, but for information, using repeated letters is less informative.

Better to try a word with distinct letters and also covering new common letters.

Good candidate: ""PASTA"" -> P,A,S,T,A -> repeated A? Again, same issue.

""PAINT"" -> but N is eliminated -> invalid.

""FAULT"" -> letters: F,A,U,L,T. None of these are in the eliminated set. So: F, A, U, L, T.

But U is not very common? Another word: ""PLAIT"" -> again, has L,T? Wait, A, I, T, etc. But let's avoid uncommon constructs.

""BOAST"" -> B,O,A,S,T. Letters: B,O,A,S,T. All distinct and all new, and avoid eliminated letters.

But note: A must not be in the third position. In ""BOAST"", A is in the third position? 
B O A S T -> A is in position 3? We need to avoid position 3 for A? 
But the feedback says A is in the word but not in the third position. So putting A in third position again might be wasting a spot? However, if we put A in third position and it gets a ✓ then we know the secret word has A in third which contradicts previous feedback? Actually, no: the previous feedback says A is not in third, so if we put A in third and it is marked x then it confirms, but if it gets ✓ that would be impossible? Actually, no because it's a different guess? But the secret word is fixed: we know A is not in the third position, so if we put A in third again and it gets ✓ that would conflict? Therefore, we should avoid position 3 for A.

So in ""BOAST"", A is in position 3 -> not ideal because we know it cannot be there. We need to put A in a different position.

How about:
- Position 1: A? -> e.g., ""ADIEU"" but has E (eliminated) -> invalid.
- Position 2: A? -> e.g., ""HASTY"" -> H,A,S,T,Y -> but H and Y not too common? But acceptable.
- Position 4: A? -> e.g., ""OPALS"" -> O,P,A,L,S -> but note, ""OPALS"" is plural? Maybe acceptable in wordle? Usually allowed if it's a word.

Wordle accepts common nouns, including plurals? But sometimes plurals can be tricky. Let me stick to non-plural.

Another idea: ""STAND"" -> has N (eliminated) -> invalid.
""SHALT"" -> not very common.

A better word: ""PASTY"" -> P,A,S,T,Y -> but A in position 2, and P,S,T,Y are new. This word may be unfamiliar? But it is a word (like the food or resembling paste).

Alternatively: ""MAILS"" -> M,A,I,L,S -> but A in position 2, and it's a common word? M-A-I-L-S. 

But let's systematically think of words that avoid [C,R,N,E] and have A in position not 3.

I recall that starting words like ""AUDIO"" have A and other vowels, but ""AUDIO"" has A in position 1 and avoids our eliminations? Letters: A,U,D,I,O -> no C,R,N,E? Yes.

Moreover, ""AUDIO"" uses vowels and D, but the eliminated letters are consonants? Anyway, it uses new letters.

But we already know A is in the word, so we could try ""AUDIO"" to check multiple vowels. However, it might be better to cover more common consonants.

Another word: ""BAILS"" -> B,A,I,L,S -> A in position 2.

But ""BAILS"" is fine.

Let's list possible words:

Position 1: A
- Words: ""ABIDE"" -> has E -> invalid.
- ""ABOUT"": A,B,O,U,T -> avoids eliminated letters? Yes: A, B, O, U, T -> all clear.

Position 2: A
- ""WAITS"": W,A,I,T,S -> avoids eliminated letters? W,A,I,T,S are not in {C,R,N,E} -> yes.

Position 4: A
- ""FOAMY"": F,O,A,M,Y -> but Y? Valid word? Yes, meaning frothy? Also: ""LOCAL"" has L,O,C,A,L -> C is eliminated -> invalid.

Position 5: A? We can have words ending with A, but that's less common in 5-letter words.

So, strong candidates:

Option 1: ""ABOUT"": A in position 1, and letters: A, B, O, U, T.

Option 2: ""WAIST"": W, A, I, S, T -> A in position 2.

Option 3: ""AUDIO"": A in position 1, U,D,I,O -> checks vowels.

Considering frequency, consonants like T, S, L are more common than U, O. But we also want to cover more frequent letters.

We have already eliminated E and R (which are high frequency), so next are T, O, I, S, etc.

I think ""WAIST"" or ""PASTA"" (but ""PASTA"" has two A's? Let me check: P,A,S,T,A -> repeated A? Actually, letters P,A,S,T -> but spelled P-A-S-T-A so positions: P1: P, P2: A, P3: S, P4: T, P5: A -> so we have two A's? That might be okay, but it reduces diversity.

Avoiding repeated letters is better for information.

So, ""WAIST"": distinct letters: W, A, I, S, T. And T, S are very common.

Similarly, ""ABOUT"" has A,B,O,U,T -> also distinct.

Now, ""AUDIO"": distinct and vowels.

But since we know A is already in the word, testing consonants might yield more information because vowels are less prevalent in positions? 

I think ""WAIST"" is a good choice because it places A in position 2 (not 3) and introduces S, T, W, I. S and T are very common.

Another candidate: ""LASTS"" -> repeated S -> bad.

I think ""WAIST"" is solid.

But let me double-check whether ""WAIST"" is acceptable: it's a word meaning the middle part of the body.

Alternatively, ""CHAOS"" -> but we have C eliminated -> invalid.

Or ""PLAID"" -> but has L and D? Letters: P,L,A,I,D -> avoids eliminations? P,L,A,I,D. Yes. And A is in position 3? Wait, PLAID: P,L,A,I,D -> A in position 3 -> we must avoid that? Yes, because we know A is not in position 3? 

PLAID: 
- Position 3: A -> but we cannot put A in position 3 because we know it's not correct? Actually, we can put it anywhere? But if we put it in position 3 and it comes back as A again in wrong position (because it is not in position 3 in the secret word) then we learn nothing new? Actually, we can: if we put A in position 3 and it gets marked as (-) meaning in the word but wrong position? Then we know the secret word does not have A in position 3 (which we already know) but also we have A in this position so it would be confusing? 

Wait, no: the feedback specifies per letter. If the secret word has an A but not in position 3, then when we put A in position 3, it should yield a ""-"" meaning in the word but wrong position? Exactly as before? But that doesn't tell us anything new. Actually, we already know A is not in position 3? So we can try a position that might be correct? 

But we don't know which position A is in? Only that it is not 3. So we could put A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5? So we have four possibilities? 

Therefore, in the next guess, we should try A in one of the other positions, such as 1 or 2 or 4? 

Therefore, ""WAIST"" has A in position 2 -> promising because if we get a ✓ then we know A is in position 2? 

Similarly, if we put A in position 1? 

Given we want information, placing A in a new position (not 3) is good. 

Now, among ""ABOUT"" and ""WAIST"", both are valid. 

But ""WAIST"" uses W and I? Not as common as T? Actually, ""WAIST"" has T and S? 

Frequency-wise, S is one of the most common? 

I think ""WAIST"" is a good word? Let me search for something better? 

Another word: ""PAID?"" but 4-letter? Wait, 5-letters: ""PALMS"" -> avoids eliminations? P,A,L,M,S -> yes? A in position 2? 

But ""PALMS"" is common? 

Let me stick to ""WAIST""? 

But perhaps a better word is ""SLATE"", but we can't because E is eliminated? 

Given the constraints, let me choose ""WAIST"" as the next guess.

Wait, but let me confirm available letters: no C,R,N,E? So W,A,I,S,T are clean? Yes? And W, I, T, S are new.

So we can expect feedback on A (in position 2) and S,T,W,I? At least we'll learn about these.

Perhaps choose a word with more common consonants than W? W is less common? But S and T are very common? 

Word ""HASTY""? But Y? 

I think ""WAIST"" is acceptable? 

Alternatively, ""TOAST""? But O? Wait, ""TOAST"": T,O,A,S,T -> repeated T? And A in position 3? Oh position? T O A S T -> position 1:T, 2:O, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T -> A in position 3 -> bad? We must avoid position 3 for A? 

So not both repeated letter and in position 3? 

Therefore, I'll go with ""WAIST"". 

So second guess: WAIST

Now, we must format: <guess>waist</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"", we know:
- A is in the secret word but not in position 3 (marked ""-"").
- C, R, N, and E are **not** in the word at all (marked ""x"").
- Therefore, the next guess must include A in a position other than 3 (i.e., position 1, 2, 4, or 5) and avoid using C, R, N, E.

For optimal information gain, the new guess should:
- Contain A in a different position than the previous guess (position 3).
- Use common English letters not yet tested, prioritizing consonants like S, T, L, O, I, etc., which have higher frequency.
- Avoid repeated letters to maximize letter coverage.

Considering these constraints, a strong candidate is ""waist"":
- Places A in position 2 (previously untested position).
- Introduces new common letters: W, S, I, T (all not eliminated).
- Avoids position 3 for A and excludes forbidden letters (C, R, N, E).
- Provides balanced information: tests two vowels (A, I) and three consonants (W, S, T), while targeting a common position for A.

Other options were considered (e.g., ""about"" for position 1 A, ""pasta"" for position 4 A) but ""waist"" uses more frequent consonants (S, T) and avoids repetition or uncommon letters.

Thought process summary: Focus on validating A's position and uncovering new letters efficiently with ""waist"".

<guess>waist</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: waist -> FEEDBACK: W(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (since it was at position 3 in ""crane"")
- C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: ""waist"" -> W(x), A(✓), I(x), S(x), T(x)
Meaning:
- A is correct and in position 2! (because it was at position 2 and marked ✓)
- W, I, S, T are not in the word.

Combining this knowledge:
- The secret word has the letter A in the second position.
- Letters NOT in the word: C, R, N, E, W, I, S, T.
- We must avoid these letters in future guesses.

Known letters:
- A is confirmed in position 2.

Now, we need to make a third guess that:
- Has A in the second position (since it's fixed).
- Does not contain C, R, N, E, W, I, S, or T.
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.
- Is a valid 5-letter English word.

Available letters: Remaining consonants and vowels not excluded. Excluded letters so far: C, R, N, E, W, I, S, T.

Common English letters remaining: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

Since we have A fixed in position 2, the word pattern is: _ A _ _ _

We need to fill the first, third, fourth, and fifth positions with letters from the remaining set.

To maximize information, we should:
- Choose a word with distinct new letters.
- Cover common remaining letters like L, O, U, M, P, etc.

Given the constraints, some possible words:

Option: ""FABLE"" -> But E is eliminated? E is in the excluded list (from guess 1), so no.
Similarly, ""TABLE"" has T (eliminated) and E -> invalid.

Option: ""AMPLE"" -> E eliminated.

Avoiding eliminated letters, let's think of words that fit _ A _ _ _.

Possible words:
- ""BALMY"": B, A, L, M, Y -> Positions: B in 1? A in 2, L in 3, M in 4, Y in 5? And letters: B, L, M, Y? All from available? Yes: B not excluded, L not, M not, Y not? And A fixed.
But check: B, A, L, M, Y. L and M are allowed? Yes? 
Now, is ""BALMY"" a word? Yes, meaning pleasant weather? E.g., ""balmy breeze"".

Another candidate: ""GAMLY""? Not common. Maybe not valid.
""DALLY""? But L in third? Letters: D, A, L, L, Y? Repeated L? Also, D, A, L, Y. With repeated L? Less ideal for info.

Better to have distinct letters? Yes.

Another word: ""HABIT"" -> But T is eliminated? T is excluded? (from ""waist"" feedback: T(x)), so no.

""JAZZY"" repeated Z? Not good.

""KAPUT""? K, A, P, U, T? T excluded? No? T is excluded? Recall: T(x) in guess 2 -> eliminated? Yes? So ""kaput"" has T? Invalid.

Systematically, we have:

First letter: Can be B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, ...? But after A, need letters? Think of the pattern: first letter must be from available consonants? Not necessarily vowel? 

Common possibilities:

- Third letter: Could be vowel like O, U? Or consonant? 

Words:
- ""BASIC"" but S and C excluded? S excluded? Yes? So no.
- ""BAGGY"" repeated G? Not ideal? Also, Y at end? 
But G available? No S excluded? 

Hmm, let's list:

With A in position 2: Possible? 

- ""LABOR"" but L,A,B,O,R? R is excluded? From guess 1 R(x) -> eliminated.
- ""MAJOR""? M,A,J,O,R? R excluded? Also, O? 
""MAJOR"": R excluded -> invalid.

""PADDY"" double D? Not distinct? Also, Y? And D is available? 

Better: ""POLLY"" double L? No repeated? Also O? But O is available? 

Perhaps: ""FLAKY""? F,L,A,K,Y? Letters: F, L, A, K, Y? All available? (no exclusions? C,R,N,E,W,I,S,T excluded -> F,L,K,Y are clean?) Yes? And distinct letters? Yes? 
""FLAKY"" is valid? Meaning unreliable? Yes, English word.

Similarly, another word: ""QUACK"" -> But Q? And includes C? C excluded? No? 

Alternative: ""GLAMY""? Not standard. 

Another: ""VANED"" but N and E excluded? No? N eliminated? From crane: N(x) -> excluded? So no.

So strong candidate: ""FLAKY""? F-L-A-K-Y? 

Third position: could be critical? Currently? Pattern _ A _ _ _

If we guess ""FLAKY"", feedback on F,L,K,Y? 

But we can consider? Also, Y at end? 

Another option: ""BALKY"" -> B,A,L,K,Y? Similar? 

Both ""FLAKY"" and ""BALKY"" are valid.

Which one to choose? For commonness? Or letter frequency?

Remaining high frequency letters: L,O,U,M,P? Etc.

In ""FLAKY"": F,L,K,Y -> F and K less common? L is common? 

Perhaps include O? 

With O: what words? _ A O _ _

For example: ""MAYOR"" but Y? And M? But R excluded? Also? ""MAJOR"" has R? Excluded? 

""RADIO"" R excluded? 

""GAUZE"" has E excluded? 

""FAUNA"" U? And N excluded? N eliminated? 

""HALLO"" double L? Not distinct? 

""MANGO"" M,A,N,G,O? N excluded? Invalid? 

So, hard to include O? 

Another word ""ABOUT"" but O? But in ""ABOUT"" A is in position 2? But we cannot use T? T excluded? And also U? 
""ABODE"" E excluded? 

Perhaps better to stick with L? 

Let me search for available words: 

Another possibility: ""JUMBO"" but J? And A not in second? 

Not fitting? 

""POLAR"" O? But A in fourth? And R excluded? No? 

We must have A in position 2? 

So, back to: 

""FLAKY"": letters F,L,A,K,Y -> yes? 

Or ""BALKY"": B,A,L,K,Y -> both have L,K,Y? And F or B? 

F is less common? Maybe B is better? 

""HAVOC""? H,A,V,O,C? C and O? But C excluded? C from ""crane"" is x? Eliminated? 

""VALID""? V,A,L,I,D? But I excluded? From ""waist"" I(x)? Eliminated? 

So? ""VALET"" E and T excluded? 

Perhaps ""YODEL"" but no A? Position 2 must be A? 

Stuck? 

Or ""GAWKY"" G,A,W,K,Y? But W excluded? From ""waist"" W(x)? Oh, W eliminated? So ""GAWKY"" invalid? 

Therefore, words without W,I,S,T,C,R,N,E? And A in second? 

So L is remaining? 

Thus, valid words: 

Consider ""BALKY"" : B,A,L,K,Y -> available letters? Yes? And distinct? Yes? 

Similarly ""FLAKY"" : F,A,L,K,Y? 

Both are valid, and we can choose either? 

But note: both end with Y? And positions? 

In ""BALKY"": positions: B1, A2, L3, K4, Y5? 

If secret has L? Or? 

But we are testing key positions? 

Alternative word: ""MADAM"" double M and double A? Not good? Avoid? 

""PAPAL"" repeated P? Also A? Not? 

Hard? Another: ""PADDY"" double D? 

So? 

I think ""BALKY"" or ""FLAKY""? 

Perhaps ""GAMER"" E excluded? 

I found ""QUAGGY"" not length? 

So, better to go with ""BALKY"" or ""FLAKY""? 

Decision: ""BALKY"" uses B which is more common than F? Frequency-wise? In English? F and K less common? 

But Y is also? 

To balance? 

Perhaps choose a word that uses M or P? 

For instance: ""AMPLE"" E excluded? 

""MAPLE"" E? Excluded? 

""LAPEL"" L,A,P,E,L? E excluded? 

""RAPED"" E? 

Okay, difficult? 

Another candidate: ""BADLY"" B,A,D,L,Y? Letters: B,D,L,Y? All available? And A? Yes? Distinct? Yes? 

""BADLY"" - adverb meaning poorly? Valid? Yes? Positions: B1, A2, D3, L4, Y5? 

Similarly? 

Compared to ""BALKY""? 

Both have L? ""BADLY"" has D instead of K? 

D is more common? 

Another: ""DAILY"" I? excluded? 

No? 

""FADED"" repeated D? Avoid? 

Therefore, I will choose ""BADLY"" because it uses common letters B, D, L, Y? And D is a new consonant? 

So next guess: ""BADLY""

But confirm: 
- Positions: 1:B, 2:A, 3:D, 4:L, 5:Y? 
- Avoids excluded letters? C,R,N,E,W,I,S,T? Yes? 
- Includes A fixed in 2? Yes? 

So <guess>badly</guess>? 

But note: with feedback, this tests D in position 3, L in position 4, Y in position 5? 

Alternatively? 

Another word? ""HARDY"" H,A,R,D,Y? R excluded? 

""LARDY"" L,A,R,D,Y? R excluded? 

So ""BADLY"" seems solid? 

Perhaps ""PADDY"" double D? But with D? Let's see if repetition is worth? But less informative? 

So I think ""BADLY"" is good? 

Final choice: ""BADLY""

Therefore, guessed word: badlyBased on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: A is in the word but not in position 3. C, R, N, E are not in the word.
- **Guess 2 (""waist"")**: A is confirmed in position 2! W, I, S, T are not in the word.

**Inferences**:
- The secret word has **A in position 2**: pattern is `_ A _ _ _`.
- Eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, W, I, S, T. Future guesses must avoid these.
- Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

**Strategy for third guess**:
- Keep **A in position 2**.
- Choose a word with distinct, common unused letters to maximize information gain (e.g., focus on consonants like B, D, L, M).
- Avoid eliminated letters and position 3 for A (already known wrong).

Strong candidate: **BADLY** (B1, A2, D3, L4, Y5).  
- Why?  
  - Uses new common consonants (B, D, L) and tests Y.  
  - Avoids repetition and uses high-frequency letters: D and L are among top English frequencies.  
  - Valid word: adjective/adverb meaning ""in a poor or inadequate way"".  
- Expected outcomes:  
  - If B, D, L, or Y get `✓`, their positions are solved.  
  - If `-`, letters are correct but misplaced.  
  - If `x`, letters are eliminated, narrowing options further.

<guess>badly</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: waist -> FEEDBACK: W(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) T(x)
Guess 3: badly -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) D(x) L(x) Y(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
  - A is in the word but not in position 3.
  - C, R, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""waist"" -> W(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) T(x)
  - A is correct and in position 2 (so the word has A as the second letter).
  - W, I, S, T are not in the word.

Guess 3: ""badly"" -> B(x) A(✓) D(x) L(x) Y(✓)
  - A is still correct in position 2 (as expected).
  - Y is correct and in position 5 (so the word ends with Y).
  - B, D, L are not in the word.

Now, combining all feedback:

- The word has the pattern: _ A _ _ Y
- A is in position 2, Y in position 5.
- Eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, W, I, S, T, B, D, L
- We know the word must have two more letters (positions 1 and 3) and one more letter in position 4? Actually, positions 1, 3, and 4? Wait, no: the word is 5 letters: position 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
  - Position 2: A (fixed)
  - Position 5: Y (fixed)
  - Positions 1, 3, and 4 are unknown.

But note: we have eliminated many letters. The remaining letters are from the set: F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Z.

Also, we must consider that the word has exactly 5 letters, and we know two of them (A and Y) and their positions.

Now, we need to find a word that fits: [letter1] A [letter3] [letter4] Y

With letter1, letter3, letter4 from the remaining letters: F,G,H,J,K,M,O,P,Q,U,V,X,Z.

Moreover, we have no information about letter4 yet? But in the pattern, it's the fourth letter.

We must also consider that the word might have repeated letters? But so far, we haven't seen any, but it's possible? However, we have eliminated many, so we can avoid repetition for now.

Now, we need to make a guess that uses letters from the remaining set to test positions 1, 3, and 4.

Common letters remaining: G, H, K, M, O, P, U, V? (F, J, Q, X, Z are less common)

We should try to cover as many common letters as possible in one guess.

Possible words that fit the pattern and use only available letters:

- ""HAPPY"": but H is available? And P? But double P? Also, A is in 2, Y in 5? So H A P P Y? But we have two P's? And we don't know if P is in the word? But we can use it? However, repeated P? Not ideal for information? But if we get feedback, we can learn? But let's see.

But note: we have eliminated B, D, L? So ""HAPPY"" uses H, A, P, P, Y? But A and Y are fixed? So we are testing H in position 1 and P in positions 3 and 4? But repeated P? So if P is in the word, we might get partial feedback? But it's acceptable? However, we might get less information.

Better to avoid repetition? So let's try for distinct letters.

What words? 

- ""GAMMY"": G A M M Y? Double M? Not distinct.

- ""JAMMY"": J A M M Y? Double M? Also, J is less common.

- ""MAYBE"": but E is eliminated? And B eliminated? 

- ""PAPPY"": double P? 

- ""HAPPY"" as above? 

But let's think: 

- ""HAPPY"": H in 1, A in 2, P in 3, P in 4, Y in 5? 

But we don't know if P is in the word? 

Alternatively, ""GASSY"": but S eliminated? 

""HAVOC"": H A V O C? But C eliminated? 

""JAZZY"": double Z? 

""MAUVE"": M A U V E? E eliminated? 

""PADDY"": D eliminated? 

""FANNY"": F A N N Y? N eliminated? 

""JAGGY"": J A G G Y? Double G? 

""KAPPA"": K A P P A? Double P and A? But A is already known? And we don't know if A is repeated? But in position 1? But we have A in 2? So if we put A in 1? But we know A is in 2? So if we put A in 1, it would be marked as (-) if present? But we know it's in 2? So putting A in 1 would be wrong? And we know it's not in 1? Because it's in 2? Actually, we don't know if there is another A? But from feedback, we only know one A? But it could be repeated? 

But in ""badly"", we had A in 2 and it was ✓, and we didn't test other positions? So it's possible? 

But to avoid complexity, let's assume no repetition for now? 

So, words with distinct letters? 

Pattern: [1] A [3] [4] Y

Available letters: F,G,H,J,K,M,O,P,Q,U,V,X,Z

Try to form a word? 

- ""HAPPY"" has repeated P? 

- ""GAMMY"" repeated M? 

- ""JUMBO"" but no Y? 

- ""HUMAN"" N eliminated? 

- ""GAYAL"" G A Y A L? But Y is in 5? And A in 2? So G A Y A L? That would be positions: 1:G, 2:A, 3:Y? But Y is fixed at 5? So conflict? 

We need Y at 5? 

So, ""GAYLY""? G A Y L Y? But Y at 3 and 5? And L? But L eliminated? 

Not? 

""JOKEY"": J O K E Y? E eliminated? 

""POKEY"": P O K E Y? E eliminated? 

""MAKEY""? Not a word? 

""FOGGY"": double G? 

""BUGGY"": double G? 

""MUMMY"": double M? 

""PUPPY"": double P? 

It's hard to find a word with distinct letters? 

Perhaps ""HAVOC"" but C eliminated? 

""JACKY"": C and K? But C eliminated? 

""QUACK"": C eliminated? 

""QUAFF"": Q U A F F? Double F? 

""QUAGY""? Not a word? 

""VAGUE"": G U? But E eliminated? 

""VAMPY""? Not common? 

""WACKY"": W eliminated? 

So, maybe we have to accept a word with repeated letters? 

Another idea: ""HAPPY"" is a common word? 

But let's see if there is a word without repetition? 

""GAZPY""? Not a word? 

""KAPOK"": K A P O K? But K repeated? 

""MAVIE""? Not? 

""PAVKY""? Not? 

""OAKUM"": O A K U M? But O in 1? A in 2? K in 3? U in 4? M in 5? But we need Y in 5? So not? 

We need Y at 5? 

So, the word must end with Y? 

Therefore, position 4 must be a letter that can come before Y? 

Commonly? 

For example: ""HAPPY"" has P before Y? 

""FUNKY"": F U N K Y? N eliminated? 

""JUMPY"": J U M P Y? This is a word? Meaning nervous? Yes? 

Letters: J, U, M, P, Y? All available? And distinct? 

Yes! J, U, M, P, Y? 

And pattern: J A? Wait, no: we have to put A in 2? 

""JUMPY"" is J U M P Y? But we need A in position 2? 

So we cannot use ""JUMPY"" because it doesn't have A? 

We must have A in position 2? 

So the word is: [1] A [3] [4] Y

So we need a word that has A in second and Y in fifth? 

""JUMPY"" doesn't have A? 

So not? 

Another word: ""GIPSY"": G I P S Y? But I and S eliminated? 

""TIPSY"": T and S eliminated? 

""POPPY"": double P? 

""DUMPY"": D eliminated? 

""GUPPY"": G U P P Y? Double P? 

""HUMPY"": H U M P Y? But M and P? And H? 

But ""HUMPY"" is a word? Meaning having humps? Yes? 

But pattern: H U M P Y? But we need A in position 2? So not? 

We must have A in position 2? 

So, let's list possible words that fit _ A _ _ Y and use available letters? 

- ""HAPPY"": H A P P Y? Uses H, P? And repeated P? 

- ""JAPAN"": J A P A N? But N eliminated? 

- ""KAPPA"": K A P P A? Double P and A? 

- ""PAPAY"": not a word? 

- ""QADDI"": not? 

- ""RABBY"": R eliminated? 

- ""SABBY"": S eliminated? 

- ""TABBY"": T eliminated? 

- ""HABIT"": H A B I T? B and I and T eliminated? 

- ""FADDY"": F A D D Y? D eliminated? 

- ""GADDY"": G A D D Y? D eliminated? 

- ""LADDY"": L and D eliminated? 

- ""MADLY"": M A D L Y? D and L eliminated? 

- ""PALLY"": P A L L Y? L eliminated? 

- ""RALLY"": R and L eliminated? 

- ""SALLY"": S and L eliminated? 

- ""TALLY"": T and L eliminated? 

- ""WALLY"": W and L eliminated? 

- ""FANNY"": F A N N Y? N eliminated? 

- ""CANNY"": C and N eliminated? 

- ""FUNNY"": F U N N Y? N eliminated? 

- ""GUNNY"": G U N N Y? N eliminated? 

- ""HONEY"": H O N E Y? N and E eliminated? 

- ""MONEY"": M O N E Y? N and E eliminated? 

- ""PINEY"": P I N E Y? I, N, E eliminated? 

- ""VINNY"": V I N N Y? I and N eliminated? 

- ""BAGGY"": B and G? B eliminated? 

- ""CABBY"": C and B eliminated? 

- ""DADDY"": D eliminated? 

- ""JAGGY"": J A G G Y? Double G? 

- ""JAZZY"": J A Z Z Y? Double Z? 

- ""KARMA"": K A R M A? R eliminated? 

- ""MANGA"": M A N G A? N eliminated? 

- ""PAGAN"": P A G A N? N eliminated? 

- ""VAGAL"": V A G A L? L eliminated? 

- ""WAGON"": W and G? W eliminated? 

- ""YAHOO"": Y A H O O? But Y is at 1? But we need Y at 5? 

So, after this, it seems ""HAPPY"" is a possible word? 

But we have not eliminated H or P? 

Another word: ""GAUPY""? Not a word? 

""JAUKY""? J A U K Y? This is a word? Meaning shy? Rare? 

""MAUZY""? Not? 

""PAUKY""? P A U K Y? Meaning cunning? Scottish? 

But let's stick to common words? 

""HAZY"": only 4 letters? 

""HAYEY""? H A Y E Y? But E eliminated? And Y at 3? 

Not? 

So, perhaps ""HAPPY"" is the most common? 

But we have to consider that P might be repeated? 

Another common word: ""GASSY"" but S eliminated? 

""NASTY"" N and S and T eliminated? 

So, I think we have to go with ""HAPPY"" or similar? 

But note: in ""HAPPY"", we are testing H in position 1 and P in positions 3 and 4? 

If we guess ""HAPPY"", and if the word is ""HAPPY"", we win? 

But if not, we get feedback on H and P? 

For example, if H is not in the word, it will be x? And P? If P is in the word, we might get - or ✓ for the positions? 

But since we have two P's, if one P is correct, we get one ✓ and one -? Or if both wrong, then x? 

But it's acceptable? 

To avoid repetition, is there a word with distinct letters? 

Let me try: ""JAMBU""? Not? 

""KAMIK"": K A M I K? I eliminated? 

""MAHOE"": M A H O E? E eliminated? 

""PAGLE""? Not? 

""QUAHAUG"": too long? 

""QUAKY"": Q U A K Y? But U in position 2? But we need A in 2? So ""Q U A K Y"" has U in 1, A in 2, K in 3, Y in 4? But we need 5 letters? ""QUAKY"" is 5: Q-U-A-K-Y? Positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:A, 4:K, 5:Y? But we need A in position 2? Here A is in position 3? So not? 

We need A in position 2? 

So, ""QUAKY"" has A in 3? Not 2? 

Another: ""GAWKY"": G A W K Y? But W eliminated? 

So, I think we have to use a word with repeated letters? 

But let's try ""HAPPY"" for now? 

But there is ""HANKY"": H A N K Y? N eliminated? 

""PARKY"": P A R K Y? R eliminated? 

""FJORD"": no A? 

So, I think ""HAPPY"" is a valid guess? 

But let's see if there is a word like ""HAPPY"" but without repetition? 

""HAVOC"" not? 

""JACKY"" not? 

""PADDY"" not? 

""GAFFY"": G A F F Y? Double F? 

""GAFFY"" is a word? Meaning hook? Rare? 

""JAFFA"": J A F F A? Double F and A? 

Not distinct? 

So, I will go with ""HAPPY"" as the next guess? 

But note: we have not used M, O, U, V, etc.? 

Another word: ""HUMOR"" no Y? 

""MAYOR"" M A Y O R? But Y in 3? And R eliminated? 

Not? 

""PUDGY"" P U D G Y? D eliminated? 

So, ""HAPPY"" seems the best option? 

Therefore, fourth guess: ""HAPPY"" 

But let's format: <guess>happy</guess> 

But we have to be careful: if the word is not ""HAPPY"", we get feedback? 

For example, if H is not in the word, and P is not, then we get all x except A and Y? 

But then we have to try other letters? 

But we have only 3 guesses left? 

We have used 3, so this is the fourth? 

But let's proceed? 

Perhaps there is a better word? 

Another idea: ""JUMPY"" is not possible? 

Or ""GAMMY"" double M? 

But ""GAMMY"" is a word? Meaning lame? 

G A M M Y? Pattern: G1, A2, M3, M4, Y5? 

But repeated M? 

Similarly, ""HAPPY"" has repeated P? 

But both are similar? 

I think ""HAPPY"" is more common? 

So I'll go with that.### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
  - Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
    - A is in the word but not in position 3.  
    - C, R, N, E are eliminated (not in the word).  

- **Guess 2: ""waist""**  
  - Feedback: W(x), A(✓), I(x), S(x), T(x)  
    - A is confirmed in position 2.  
    - W, I, S, T are eliminated.  

- **Guess 3: ""badly""**  
  - Feedback: B(x), A(✓), D(x), L(x), Y(✓)  
    - A is confirmed in position 2 (redundant but consistent).  
    - Y is confirmed in position 5.  
    - B, D, L are eliminated.  

### Key Inferences
- **Word pattern**: The secret word must be `_ A _ _ Y` (A in position 2, Y in position 5).  
- **Eliminated letters (13 total)**: C, R, N, E, W, I, S, T, B, D, L.  
- **Available letters (13 remaining)**: F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Z.  
- **Constraints for next guess**:  
  - Must include A in position 2 and Y in position 5.  
  - Positions 1, 3, and 4 must use letters from the available set.  
  - Avoid eliminated letters.  
- **Strategy for Guess 4**:  
  - Prioritize common letters from the available set (e.g., H, P, M, K, G) to maximize information.  
  - Test multiple positions (1, 3, 4) simultaneously.  
  - Given the limited options, repetition may be unavoidable, but distinct letters are preferred for better information gain.  
  - After evaluating possible words (e.g., ""happy"", ""gamy"", ""jumpy""), ""happy"" is selected because:  
    - It uses common letters (H, P).  
    - It tests H in position 1 and P in positions 3 and 4 (repetition is necessary due to word constraints).  
    - If ""happy"" is incorrect, feedback on H and P will significantly narrow possibilities (e.g., if P is correct, it reveals position; if not, P is eliminated).  
    - It is a valid English word.  

### Next Guess: ""happy""  
- **Pattern**: H (position 1), A (position 2), P (position 3), P (position 4), Y (position 5).  
- **Expected outcomes**:  
  - If H is `✓`, position 1 is solved. If `x`, H is eliminated.  
  - If P is `✓` in position 3 or 4, that position is solved. If `-`, P is in the word but misplaced. If `x`, P is eliminated.  
  - Feedback will reduce the solution space for the final guess(es).

Since we have no prior feedback, I need to choose a word that maximizes information gain. The best starting words usually contain common letters and avoid repetition. \n\nCommon English letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S. I should pick a word that uses several of these. ""ROATE"" is often recommended as it covers frequent letters like R, O, A, T, E. But after thinking, let me verify: R and T are very common consonants, O and A are common vowels, and E is the most common letter overall. \n\nAlternative starting words include ""CRANE,"" ""SLATE,"" or ""TRACE."" Each uses five distinct common letters. Among these, ""CRANE"" stands out because:\n- C appears in many words though not top tier frequency\n- R, A, E are top-10 frequency letters\n- N is also relatively common\n\nThis covers vowel/consonant balance well. After comparison...For the first guess, selecting a word with diverse and common letters increases chances of hitting relevant letters in the secret word. After considering options like ""ROATE"" (statistically strong), ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"", the latter stands out:  \n- Uses 5 distinct high-frequency letters (**C**, **R**, **A**, **N**, **E**)  \n- Covers major vowels (**A**, **E**) and versatile consonants  \n- Positions letters optimally (e.g., **E** at end matches many words)  \n\nThis maximizes initial information for refining subsequent guesses.\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": \n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nSo, we know:\n- The letter A is in the secret word but not in the third position (since it was the third letter in ""crane"" and marked wrong position).\n- The letters C, R, N, E are not in the secret word at all.\n\nWe must avoid using C, R, N, E in our next guess.\n\nMoreover, we know that A is present, so we must include A in the new guess, but not in the third position.\n\nFor a second guess, we want to try to place A in a different position and use other common letters that we haven\'t tried yet. We have eliminated 4 letters: C, R, N, E. The remaining available letters are most of the alphabet. We should pick a word that includes A and four new letters that are common to get more information.\n\nCommon English letters remaining: S, T, O, I, L, D, U, M, P, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, V, J, X, Q, Z.\n\nWe can choose a word that starts with or contains A and avoids the eliminated letters.\n\nWe also note that A cannot be in position 3.\n\nIdeally, we place A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\nLet\'s think of common words that contain A and four other common letters not in {C,R,N,E}.\n\nSome possibilities:\n- Using the letter A and other high frequency letters: S, T, L, I, O, etc.\n\nWord ideas:\n- ""SLATE"": but we must avoid E because it was eliminated? Wait, E is eliminated -> x meaning not present, so we cannot use E. ""SLATE"" has E which is eliminated.\n- ""PLANT"": has N which is eliminated -> cannot use N.\n- ""TRAIL"": has R which is eliminated -> discard.\n- ""FLAIL"": has L twice and R? Wait, R is eliminated -> discard.\n\nWe need to avoid C, R, N, E.\n\nLet\'s try words with A and other available letters.\n\nGood words might include ""SAVOR"", ""STOMP"", but they don\'t have A? We must include A because we know it is in the word.\n\nSo, words that have A and avoid C,R,N,E:\n\nPossible words: \n- ""SALAD"" -> but double A? Actually, double A may not be ideal because we don\'t know if the secret word has two A\'s. But it\'s acceptable if we don\'t have a better word. However, note that in ""SALAD"", A is in position 2 and 4? But we have only one A in the secret word? Actually, we don\'t know, but for information, using repeated letters is less informative.\n\nBetter to try a word with distinct letters and also covering new common letters.\n\nGood candidate: ""PASTA"" -> P,A,S,T,A -> repeated A? Again, same issue.\n\n""PAINT"" -> but N is eliminated -> invalid.\n\n""FAULT"" -> letters: F,A,U,L,T. None of these are in the eliminated set. So: F, A, U, L, T.\n\nBut U is not very common? Another word: ""PLAIT"" -> again, has L,T? Wait, A, I, T, etc. But let\'s avoid uncommon constructs.\n\n""BOAST"" -> B,O,A,S,T. Letters: B,O,A,S,T. All distinct and all new, and avoid eliminated letters.\n\nBut note: A must not be in the third position. In ""BOAST"", A is in the third position? \nB O A S T -> A is in position 3? We need to avoid position 3 for A? \nBut the feedback says A is in the word but not in the third position. So putting A in third position again might be wasting a spot? However, if we put A in third position and it gets a ✓ then we know the secret word has A in third which contradicts previous feedback? Actually, no: the previous feedback says A is not in third, so if we put A in third and it is marked x then it confirms, but if it gets ✓ that would be impossible? Actually, no because it\'s a different guess? But the secret word is fixed: we know A is not in the third position, so if we put A in third again and it gets ✓ that would conflict? Therefore, we should avoid position 3 for A.\n\nSo in ""BOAST"", A is in position 3 -> not ideal because we know it cannot be there. We need to put A in a different position.\n\nHow about:\n- Position 1: A? -> e.g., ""ADIEU"" but has E (eliminated) -> invalid.\n- Position 2: A? -> e.g., ""HASTY"" -> H,A,S,T,Y -> but H and Y not too common? But acceptable.\n- Position 4: A? -> e.g., ""OPALS"" -> O,P,A,L,S -> but note, ""OPALS"" is plural? Maybe acceptable in wordle? Usually allowed if it\'s a word.\n\nWordle accepts common nouns, including plurals? But sometimes plurals can be tricky. Let me stick to non-plural.\n\nAnother idea: ""STAND"" -> has N (eliminated) -> invalid.\n""SHALT"" -> not very common.\n\nA better word: ""PASTY"" -> P,A,S,T,Y -> but A in position 2, and P,S,T,Y are new. This word may be unfamiliar? But it is a word (like the food or resembling paste).\n\nAlternatively: ""MAILS"" -> M,A,I,L,S -> but A in position 2, and it\'s a common word? M-A-I-L-S. \n\nBut let\'s systematically think of words that avoid [C,R,N,E] and have A in position not 3.\n\nI recall that starting words like ""AUDIO"" have A and other vowels, but ""AUDIO"" has A in position 1 and avoids our eliminations? Letters: A,U,D,I,O -> no C,R,N,E? Yes.\n\nMoreover, ""AUDIO"" uses vowels and D, but the eliminated letters are consonants? Anyway, it uses new letters.\n\nBut we already know A is in the word, so we could try ""AUDIO"" to check multiple vowels. However, it might be better to cover more common consonants.\n\nAnother word: ""BAILS"" -> B,A,I,L,S -> A in position 2.\n\nBut ""BAILS"" is fine.\n\nLet\'s list possible words:\n\nPosition 1: A\n- Words: ""ABIDE"" -> has E -> invalid.\n- ""ABOUT"": A,B,O,U,T -> avoids eliminated letters? Yes: A, B, O, U, T -> all clear.\n\nPosition 2: A\n- ""WAITS"": W,A,I,T,S -> avoids eliminated letters? W,A,I,T,S are not in {C,R,N,E} -> yes.\n\nPosition 4: A\n- ""FOAMY"": F,O,A,M,Y -> but Y? Valid word? Yes, meaning frothy? Also: ""LOCAL"" has L,O,C,A,L -> C is eliminated -> invalid.\n\nPosition 5: A? We can have words ending with A, but that\'s less common in 5-letter words.\n\nSo, strong candidates:\n\nOption 1: ""ABOUT"": A in position 1, and letters: A, B, O, U, T.\n\nOption 2: ""WAIST"": W, A, I, S, T -> A in position 2.\n\nOption 3: ""AUDIO"": A in position 1, U,D,I,O -> checks vowels.\n\nConsidering frequency, consonants like T, S, L are more common than U, O. But we also want to cover more frequent letters.\n\nWe have already eliminated E and R (which are high frequency), so next are T, O, I, S, etc.\n\nI think ""WAIST"" or ""PASTA"" (but ""PASTA"" has two A\'s? Let me check: P,A,S,T,A -> repeated A? Actually, letters P,A,S,T -> but spelled P-A-S-T-A so positions: P1: P, P2: A, P3: S, P4: T, P5: A -> so we have two A\'s? That might be okay, but it reduces diversity.\n\nAvoiding repeated letters is better for information.\n\nSo, ""WAIST"": distinct letters: W, A, I, S, T. And T, S are very common.\n\nSimilarly, ""ABOUT"" has A,B,O,U,T -> also distinct.\n\nNow, ""AUDIO"": distinct and vowels.\n\nBut since we know A is already in the word, testing consonants might yield more information because vowels are less prevalent in positions? \n\nI think ""WAIST"" is a good choice because it places A in position 2 (not 3) and introduces S, T, W, I. S and T are very common.\n\nAnother candidate: ""LASTS"" -> repeated S -> bad.\n\nI think ""WAIST"" is solid.\n\nBut let me double-check whether ""WAIST"" is acceptable: it\'s a word meaning the middle part of the body.\n\nAlternatively, ""CHAOS"" -> but we have C eliminated -> invalid.\n\nOr ""PLAID"" -> but has L and D? Letters: P,L,A,I,D -> avoids eliminations? P,L,A,I,D. Yes. And A is in position 3? Wait, PLAID: P,L,A,I,D -> A in position 3 -> we must avoid that? Yes, because we know A is not in position 3? \n\nPLAID: \n- Position 3: A -> but we cannot put A in position 3 because we know it\'s not correct? Actually, we can put it anywhere? But if we put it in position 3 and it comes back as A again in wrong position (because it is not in position 3 in the secret word) then we learn nothing new? Actually, we can: if we put A in position 3 and it gets marked as (-) meaning in the word but wrong position? Then we know the secret word does not have A in position 3 (which we already know) but also we have A in this position so it would be confusing? \n\nWait, no: the feedback specifies per letter. If the secret word has an A but not in position 3, then when we put A in position 3, it should yield a ""-"" meaning in the word but wrong position? Exactly as before? But that doesn\'t tell us anything new. Actually, we already know A is not in position 3? So we can try a position that might be correct? \n\nBut we don\'t know which position A is in? Only that it is not 3. So we could put A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5? So we have four possibilities? \n\nTherefore, in the next guess, we should try A in one of the other positions, such as 1 or 2 or 4? \n\nTherefore, ""WAIST"" has A in position 2 -> promising because if we get a ✓ then we know A is in position 2? \n\nSimilarly, if we put A in position 1? \n\nGiven we want information, placing A in a new position (not 3) is good. \n\nNow, among ""ABOUT"" and ""WAIST"", both are valid. \n\nBut ""WAIST"" uses W and I? Not as common as T? Actually, ""WAIST"" has T and S? \n\nFrequency-wise, S is one of the most common? \n\nI think ""WAIST"" is a good word? Let me search for something better? \n\nAnother word: ""PAID?"" but 4-letter? Wait, 5-letters: ""PALMS"" -> avoids eliminations? P,A,L,M,S -> yes? A in position 2? \n\nBut ""PALMS"" is common? \n\nLet me stick to ""WAIST""? \n\nBut perhaps a better word is ""SLATE"", but we can\'t because E is eliminated? \n\nGiven the constraints, let me choose ""WAIST"" as the next guess.\n\nWait, but let me confirm available letters: no C,R,N,E? So W,A,I,S,T are clean? Yes? And W, I, T, S are new.\n\nSo we can expect feedback on A (in position 2) and S,T,W,I? At least we\'ll learn about these.\n\nPerhaps choose a word with more common consonants than W? W is less common? But S and T are very common? \n\nWord ""HASTY""? But Y? \n\nI think ""WAIST"" is acceptable? \n\nAlternatively, ""TOAST""? But O? Wait, ""TOAST"": T,O,A,S,T -> repeated T? And A in position 3? Oh position? T O A S T -> position 1:T, 2:O, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T -> A in position 3 -> bad? We must avoid position 3 for A? \n\nSo not both repeated letter and in position 3? \n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""WAIST"". \n\nSo second guess: WAIST\n\nNow, we must format: <guess>waist</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"", we know:\n- A is in the secret word but not in position 3 (marked ""-"").\n- C, R, N, and E are **not** in the word at all (marked ""x"").\n- Therefore, the next guess must include A in a position other than 3 (i.e., position 1, 2, 4, or 5) and avoid using C, R, N, E.\n\nFor optimal information gain, the new guess should:\n- Contain A in a different position than the previous guess (position 3).\n- Use common English letters not yet tested, prioritizing consonants like S, T, L, O, I, etc., which have higher frequency.\n- Avoid repeated letters to maximize letter coverage.\n\nConsidering these constraints, a strong candidate is ""waist"":\n- Places A in position 2 (previously untested position).\n- Introduces new common letters: W, S, I, T (all not eliminated).\n- Avoids position 3 for A and excludes forbidden letters (C, R, N, E).\n- Provides balanced information: tests two vowels (A, I) and three consonants (W, S, T), while targeting a common position for A.\n\nOther options were considered (e.g., ""about"" for position 1 A, ""pasta"" for position 4 A) but ""waist"" uses more frequent consonants (S, T) and avoids repetition or uncommon letters.\n\nThought process summary: Focus on validating A\'s position and uncovering new letters efficiently with ""waist"".\n\n<guess>waist</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: waist -> FEEDBACK: W(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)\nMeaning:\n- A is in the word but not in position 3 (since it was at position 3 in ""crane"")\n- C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.\n\nGuess 2: ""waist"" -> W(x), A(✓), I(x), S(x), T(x)\nMeaning:\n- A is correct and in position 2!

Frequency-wise? In English? F and K less common? \n\nBut Y is also? \n\nTo balance? \n\nPerhaps choose a word that uses M or P? \n\nFor instance: ""AMPLE"" E excluded? \n\n""MAPLE"" E? Excluded? \n\n""LAPEL"" L,A,P,E,L? E excluded? \n\n""RAPED"" E? \n\nOkay, difficult? \n\nAnother candidate: ""BADLY"" B,A,D,L,Y? Letters: B,D,L,Y? All available? And A? Yes? Distinct? Yes? \n\n""BADLY"" - adverb meaning poorly? Valid? Yes? Positions: B1, A2, D3, L4, Y5? \n\nSimilarly? \n\nCompared to ""BALKY""? \n\nBoth have L? ""BADLY"" has D instead of K? \n\nD is more common? \n\nAnother: ""DAILY"" I? excluded? \n\nNo? \n\n""FADED"" repeated D? Avoid? \n\nTherefore, I will choose ""BADLY"" because it uses common letters B, D, L, Y? And D is a new consonant? \n\nSo next guess: ""BADLY""\n\nBut confirm: \n- Positions: 1:B, 2:A, 3:D, 4:L, 5:Y? \n- Avoids excluded letters? C,R,N,E,W,I,S,T? Yes? \n- Includes A fixed in 2? Yes? \n\nSo <guess>badly</guess>? \n\nBut note: with feedback, this tests D in position 3, L in position 4, Y in position 5? \n\nAlternatively? \n\nAnother word? ""HARDY"" H,A,R,D,Y?

But if we get feedback, we can learn? But let\'s see.\n\nBut note: we have eliminated B, D, L? So ""HAPPY"" uses H, A, P, P, Y? But A and Y are fixed?

So if we put A in 1, it would be marked as (-) if present? But we know it\'s in 2? So putting A in 1 would be wrong? And we know it\'s not in 1? Because it\'s in 2?

This is a word? Meaning shy? Rare? \n\n""MAUZY""? Not? \n\n""PAUKY""? P A U K Y? Meaning cunning? Scottish? \n\nBut let\'s stick to common words? \n\n""HAZY"": only 4 letters? \n\n""HAYEY""? H A Y E Y? But E eliminated? And Y at 3? \n\nNot? \n\nSo, perhaps ""HAPPY"" is the most common? \n\nBut we have to consider that P might be repeated? \n\nAnother common word: ""GASSY"" but S eliminated? \n\n""NASTY"" N and S and T eliminated? \n\nSo, I think we have to go with ""HAPPY"" or similar? \n\nBut note: in ""HAPPY"", we are testing H in position 1 and P in positions 3 and 4? \n\nIf we guess ""HAPPY"", and if the word is ""HAPPY"", we win? \n\nBut if not, we get feedback on H and P? \n\nFor example, if H is not in the word, it will be x?

So ""Q U A K Y"" has U in 1, A in 2, K in 3, Y in 4? But we need 5 letters? ""QUAKY"" is 5: Q-U-A-K-Y? Positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:A, 4:K, 5:Y? But we need A in position 2? Here A is in position 3? So not? \n\nWe need A in position 2? \n\nSo, ""QUAKY"" has A in 3? Not 2? \n\nAnother: ""GAWKY"": G A W K Y? But W eliminated? \n\nSo, I think we have to use a word with repeated letters? \n\nBut let\'s try ""HAPPY"" for now? \n\nBut there is ""HANKY"": H A N K Y? N eliminated? \n\n""PARKY"": P A R K Y? R eliminated? \n\n""FJORD"": no A? \n\nSo, I think ""HAPPY"" is a valid guess? \n\nBut let\'s see if there is a word like ""HAPPY"" but without repetition? \n\n""HAVOC"" not? \n\n""JACKY"" not? \n\n""PADDY"" not? \n\n""GAFFY"": G A F F Y? Double F? \n\n""GAFFY"" is a word? Meaning hook? Rare? \n\n""JAFFA"": J A F F A? Double F and A? \n\nNot distinct? \n\nSo, I will go with ""HAPPY"" as the next guess? \n\nBut note: we have not used M, O, U, V, etc.? \n\nAnother word: ""HUMOR"" no Y? \n\n""MAYOR"" M A Y O R? But Y in 3? And R eliminated? \n\nNot? \n\n""PUDGY"" P U D G Y? D eliminated? \n\nSo, ""HAPPY"" seems the best option? \n\nTherefore, fourth guess: ""HAPPY"" \n\nBut let\'s format: <guess>happy</guess> \n\nBut we have to be careful: if the word is not ""HAPPY"", we get feedback? \n\nFor example, if H is not in the word, and P is not, then we get all x except A and Y? \n\nBut then we have to try other letters? \n\nBut we have only 3 guesses left? \n\nWe have used 3, so this is the fourth? \n\nBut let\'s proceed? \n\nPerhaps there is a better word? \n\nAnother idea: ""JUMPY"" is not possible? \n\nOr ""GAMMY"" double M? \n\nBut ""GAMMY"" is a word?

We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
  - A is in the word but not in position 3.
  - C, R, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""waist"" -> W(x), A(✓), I(x), S(x), T(x)
  - A is correct and in position 2 (so the word has A as the second letter).
  - W, I, S, T are not in the word.

Guess 3: ""badly"" -> B(x), A(✓), D(x), L(x), Y(✓)
  - A is still correct in position 2 (as expected).
  - Y is correct and in position 5 (so the word ends with Y).
  - B, D, L are not in the word.

Guess 4: ""happy"" -> H(x), A(✓), P(x), P(x), Y(✓)
  - A and Y are still correct in positions 2 and 5.
  - H is not in the word.
  - P is not in the word (both instances are marked x, so P is eliminated).

Combining all feedback:
- The word pattern is: _ A _ _ Y
- A is in position 2, Y in position 5.
- Eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, W, I, S, T, B, D, L, H, P (from the above, plus H and P from guess 4).
- Available letters: F, G, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, X, Z (since H and P are now eliminated).

We need to form a 5-letter word of the form [1] A [3] [4] Y, using only the available letters.

Available letters: F, G, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, X, Z

We must choose letters for positions 1, 3, and 4 from these.

Now, we need to find a valid English word that fits this pattern.

Possible words:

- ""GAMMY"": G A M M Y? But M is repeated? And we don't know if M is available? It is. But let's check: G, A, M, M, Y? Positions: G1, A2, M3, M4, Y5? But repeated M? And is ""GAMMY"" a word? Yes, meaning lame or not working properly (British slang). But we have two M's? That might be acceptable? But we are testing M? However, if we use repeated M, we get less information? But we have to work with the available letters.

- ""JAMMY"": J A M M Y? Similarly, double M? Meaning lucky? Also a word.

- ""MAYBE"": But E is eliminated? And B eliminated? Not.

- ""FAKEY"": F A K E Y? E eliminated? Not.

- ""JAZZY"": J A Z Z Y? Double Z? But Z is available? And ""JAZZY"" is a word? Yes? But pattern: J1, A2, Z3, Z4, Y5? But we have two Z's? And we don't know if Z is in the word? But we can try? 

- ""GAZKY""? Not a word.

- ""KAMME""? Not a word.

- ""MAUVE"": M A U V E? E eliminated? Not.

- ""OAKUM"": O A K U M? But O in 1? A in 2? K in 3? U in 4? M in 5? But we need Y in 5? So not? 

We need Y at 5? So the word must end with Y? 

Therefore, position 4 must be a letter that can come before Y? 

Commonly? 

For example: ""GAMMY"" has M before Y? 

""JAZZY"" has Z before Y? 

But let's list possible words? 

Another: ""FOGGY"": F O G G Y? But O? And double G? But G is available? But ""FOGGY"" has O in 2? But we need A in 2? So not? 

We must have A in 2? 

So, words: 

- ""GAMMY"": G A M M Y? Valid? Yes? 

- ""JAMMY"": J A M M Y? Valid? Yes? 

- ""MAMMY"": M A M M Y? Triple M? Not? ""MAMMY"" is M A M M Y? Positions: M1, A2, M3, M4, Y5? So M in 1,3,4? But repeated? And ""mammy"" is a word? Yes? But we have three M's? 

But we can use? 

- ""MAYOR"": M A Y O R? But Y in 3? And R eliminated? Not? 

- ""VAMPY"": V A M P Y? But P eliminated? 

- ""WAVEY"": W eliminated? 

- ""ZAPPY"": Z A P P Y? P eliminated? 

- ""QUAKY"": Q U A K Y? But A in 3? Not 2? 

- ""QUAFF"": Not 5 letters? 

- ""QUAGY"": Not a word? 

- ""JUMBY"": J U M B Y? B eliminated? 

- ""MUMBO"": M U M B O? No Y? 

- ""FUMED"": E and D eliminated? 

So, the only common words seem to be ""GAMMY"" and ""JAMMY""? 

But both have double M? 

Another possibility: ""GAUMY"": G A U M Y? This is a word? Meaning sticky? Yes? And distinct letters? G, A, U, M, Y? 

Yes! ""GAUMY"" has distinct letters? 

Pattern: G1, A2, U3, M4, Y5? 

And letters: G, U, M, Y? All available? 

Similarly, ""JAUKY"": J A U K Y? Meaning shy? Rare? But valid? 

""MAUZY"": Not common? 

""OAKY"": Only 4 letters? 

""VAGUY""? Not? 

So, ""GAUMY"" is a valid word with distinct letters? 

Therefore, we can use ""GAUMY"" to test G, U, M? 

Similarly, ""JAZZY"" has repeated Z? 

But ""GAUMY"" is better? 

Another: ""GUCKY""? Not? 

""JOCKY"": J O C K Y? C eliminated? 

""JUKED"": E and D eliminated? 

""JUMAR"": No Y? 

So, I think ""GAUMY"" is a good choice? 

But let's confirm: 

- Position 1: G? 
- Position 2: A (fixed)
- Position 3: U? 
- Position 4: M? 
- Position 5: Y (fixed)

Letters: G, U, M? All available? 

Yes? 

So, we can guess ""GAUMY""? 

But is it common? It might be obscure? 

Alternative: ""GAMMY"" is more common? But repeated M? 

But for information, distinct letters are better? 

So, I'll go with ""GAUMY"" as the next guess? 

Therefore, fifth guess: ""GAUMY"" 

But note: we have only 2 guesses left? 

We have used 4, so this is the fifth? 

But let's hope it's correct? 

If not, we get feedback? 

So, <guess>gaumy</guess> 

But let's make sure: 

Available letters: F, G, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, X, Z? 

G, U, M are available? 

Yes? 

And we avoid eliminated? 

Yes? 

So, guessed word: gaumy

- **Guess 4: ""happy""**  
  - Feedback: H(x), A(✓), P(x), P(x), Y(✓)  
    - A (position 2) and Y (position 5) reconfirmed.  
    - H and P are eliminated (both P instances marked ""x"" confirm P is absent).  

### Key Inferences
- **Word pattern**: The secret word is `_ A _ _ Y` (A in position 2, Y in position 5).  
- **Eliminated letters (15 total)**: C, R, N, E, W, I, S, T, B, D, L, H, P.  
- **Available letters (11 remaining)**: F, G, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, X, Z.  
- **Strategy for Guess 5**:  
  - Must retain **A in position 2** and **Y in position 5**.  
  - Positions 1, 3, and 4 must use letters from the available set.  
  - Prioritize **distinct, common letters** to maximize information (e.g., G, M, U).  
  - After evaluating options:  
    - ""gaumy"" (G1, A2, U3, M4, Y5) is optimal:  
      - Uses distinct letters (G, U, M) to test high-frequency consonants (G, M) and a vowel (U).  
      - Valid English word (archaic term for ""sticky"" or ""clumsy"").  
      - Tests positions 1, 3, and 4 efficiently.  
    - Alternatives like ""gummy"" (repeated M) or ""jazzy"" (repeated Z, uncommon) are inferior for information gain.  

### Next Guess: ""gaumy""  
- **Expected outcomes**:  
  - If G is `✓`, position 1 is solved. If `x`, G is eliminated.  
  - If U is `✓`/`-`, it reveals position 3. If `x`, U is eliminated.  
  - If M is `✓`/`-`, it reveals position 4. If `x`, M is eliminated.  
- **Win condition**: If ""gaumy"" is correct, the game ends. Otherwise, feedback narrows to 1-2 possibilities for the final guess.

<guess>gaumy</guess>",gaumy,"We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
  - A is in the word but not in position 3.
  - C, R, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""waist"" -> W(x), A(✓), I(x), S(x), T(x)
  - A is correct and in position 2 (so the word has A as the second letter).
  - W, I, S, T are not in the word.

Guess 3: ""badly"" -> B(x), A(✓), D(x), L(x), Y(✓)
  - A is still correct in position 2 (as expected).
  - Y is correct and in position 5 (so the word ends with Y).
  - B, D, L are not in the word.

Guess 4: ""happy"" -> H(x), A(✓), P(x), P(x), Y(✓)
  - A and Y are still correct in positions 2 and 5.
  - H is not in the word.
  - P is not in the word (both instances are marked x, so P is eliminated).

Combining all feedback:
- The word pattern is: _ A _ _ Y
- A is in position 2, Y in position 5.
- Eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, W, I, S, T, B, D, L, H, P (from the above, plus H and P from guess 4).
- Available letters: F, G, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, X, Z (since H and P are now eliminated).

We need to form a 5-letter word of the form [1] A [3] [4] Y, using only the available letters.

Available letters: F, G, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, X, Z

We must choose letters for positions 1, 3, and 4 from these.

Now, we need to find a valid English word that fits this pattern.

Possible words:

- ""GAMMY"": G A M M Y? But M is repeated? And we don't know if M is available? It is. But let's check: G, A, M, M, Y? Positions: G1, A2, M3, M4, Y5? But repeated M? And is ""GAMMY"" a word? Yes, meaning lame or not working properly (British slang). But we have two M's? That might be acceptable? But we are testing M? However, if we use repeated M, we get less information? But we have to work with the available letters.

- ""JAMMY"": J A M M Y? Similarly, double M? Meaning lucky? Also a word.

- ""MAYBE"": But E is eliminated? And B eliminated? Not.

- ""FAKEY"": F A K E Y? E eliminated? Not.

- ""JAZZY"": J A Z Z Y? Double Z? But Z is available? And ""JAZZY"" is a word? Yes? But pattern: J1, A2, Z3, Z4, Y5? But we have two Z's? And we don't know if Z is in the word? But we can try? 

- ""GAZKY""? Not a word.

- ""KAMME""? Not a word.

- ""MAUVE"": M A U V E? E eliminated? Not.

- ""OAKUM"": O A K U M? But O in 1? A in 2? K in 3? U in 4? M in 5? But we need Y in 5? So not? 

We need Y at 5? So the word must end with Y? 

Therefore, position 4 must be a letter that can come before Y? 

Commonly? 

For example: ""GAMMY"" has M before Y? 

""JAZZY"" has Z before Y? 

But let's list possible words? 

Another: ""FOGGY"": F O G G Y? But O? And double G? But G is available? But ""FOGGY"" has O in 2? But we need A in 2? So not? 

We must have A in 2? 

So, words: 

- ""GAMMY"": G A M M Y? Valid? Yes? 

- ""JAMMY"": J A M M Y? Valid? Yes? 

- ""MAMMY"": M A M M Y? Triple M? Not? ""MAMMY"" is M A M M Y? Positions: M1, A2, M3, M4, Y5? So M in 1,3,4? But repeated? And ""mammy"" is a word? Yes? But we have three M's? 

But we can use? 

- ""MAYOR"": M A Y O R? But Y in 3? And R eliminated? Not? 

- ""VAMPY"": V A M P Y? But P eliminated? 

- ""WAVEY"": W eliminated? 

- ""ZAPPY"": Z A P P Y? P eliminated? 

- ""QUAKY"": Q U A K Y? But A in 3? Not 2? 

- ""QUAFF"": Not 5 letters? 

- ""QUAGY"": Not a word? 

- ""JUMBY"": J U M B Y? B eliminated? 

- ""MUMBO"": M U M B O? No Y? 

- ""FUMED"": E and D eliminated? 

So, the only common words seem to be ""GAMMY"" and ""JAMMY""? 

But both have double M? 

Another possibility: ""GAUMY"": G A U M Y? This is a word? Meaning sticky? Yes? And distinct letters? G, A, U, M, Y? 

Yes! ""GAUMY"" has distinct letters? 

Pattern: G1, A2, U3, M4, Y5? 

And letters: G, U, M, Y? All available? 

Similarly, ""JAUKY"": J A U K Y? Meaning shy? Rare? But valid? 

""MAUZY"": Not common? 

""OAKY"": Only 4 letters? 

""VAGUY""? Not? 

So, ""GAUMY"" is a valid word with distinct letters? 

Therefore, we can use ""GAUMY"" to test G, U, M? 

Similarly, ""JAZZY"" has repeated Z? 

But ""GAUMY"" is better? 

Another: ""GUCKY""? Not? 

""JOCKY"": J O C K Y? C eliminated? 

""JUKED"": E and D eliminated? 

""JUMAR"": No Y? 

So, I think ""GAUMY"" is a good choice? 

But let's confirm: 

- Position 1: G? 
- Position 2: A (fixed)
- Position 3: U? 
- Position 4: M? 
- Position 5: Y (fixed)

Letters: G, U, M? All available? 

Yes? 

So, we can guess ""GAUMY""? 

But is it common? It might be obscure? 

Alternative: ""GAMMY"" is more common? But repeated M? 

But for information, distinct letters are better? 

So, I'll go with ""GAUMY"" as the next guess? 

Therefore, fifth guess: ""GAUMY"" 

But note: we have only 2 guesses left? 

We have used 4, so this is the fifth? 

But let's hope it's correct? 

If not, we get feedback? 

So, <guess>gaumy</guess> 

But let's make sure: 

Available letters: F, G, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, X, Z? 

G, U, M are available? 

Yes? 

And we avoid eliminated? 

Yes? 

So, guessed word: gaumy### Analysis of Previous Feedback

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>Alright, let's start with our first guess in Wordle. Since we have no prior feedback, I need to choose a word that maximizes information gain. The best starting words usually contain common letters and avoid repetition. 

Common English letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S. I should pick a word that uses several of these. ""ROATE"" is often recommended as it covers frequent letters like R, O, A, T, E. But after thinking, let me verify: R and T are very common consonants, O and A are common vowels, and E is the most common letter overall. 

Alternative starting words include ""CRANE,"" ""SLATE,"" or ""TRACE."" Each uses five distinct common letters. Among these, ""CRANE"" stands out because:
- C appears in many words though not top tier frequency
- R, A, E are top-10 frequency letters
- N is also relatively common

This covers vowel/consonant balance well. After comparison...For the first guess, selecting a word with diverse and common letters increases chances of hitting relevant letters in the secret word. After considering options like ""ROATE"" (statistically strong), ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"", the latter stands out:  
- Uses 5 distinct high-frequency letters (**C**, **R**, **A**, **N**, **E**)  
- Covers major vowels (**A**, **E**) and versatile consonants  
- Positions letters optimally (e.g., **E** at end matches many words)  

This maximizes initial information for refining subsequent guesses.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": 
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The letter A is in the secret word but not in the third position (since it was the third letter in ""crane"" and marked wrong position).
- The letters C, R, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

We must avoid using C, R, N, E in our next guess.

Moreover, we know that A is present, so we must include A in the new guess, but not in the third position.

For a second guess, we want to try to place A in a different position and use other common letters that we haven't tried yet. We have eliminated 4 letters: C, R, N, E. The remaining available letters are most of the alphabet. We should pick a word that includes A and four new letters that are common to get more information.

Common English letters remaining: S, T, O, I, L, D, U, M, P, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, V, J, X, Q, Z.

We can choose a word that starts with or contains A and avoids the eliminated letters.

We also note that A cannot be in position 3.

Ideally, we place A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Let's think of common words that contain A and four other common letters not in {C,R,N,E}.

Some possibilities:
- Using the letter A and other high frequency letters: S, T, L, I, O, etc.

Word ideas:
- ""SLATE"": but we must avoid E because it was eliminated? Wait, E is eliminated -> x meaning not present, so we cannot use E. ""SLATE"" has E which is eliminated.
- ""PLANT"": has N which is eliminated -> cannot use N.
- ""TRAIL"": has R which is eliminated -> discard.
- ""FLAIL"": has L twice and R? Wait, R is eliminated -> discard.

We need to avoid C, R, N, E.

Let's try words with A and other available letters.

Good words might include ""SAVOR"", ""STOMP"", but they don't have A? We must include A because we know it is in the word.

So, words that have A and avoid C,R,N,E:

Possible words: 
- ""SALAD"" -> but double A? Actually, double A may not be ideal because we don't know if the secret word has two A's. But it's acceptable if we don't have a better word. However, note that in ""SALAD"", A is in position 2 and 4? But we have only one A in the secret word? Actually, we don't know, but for information, using repeated letters is less informative.

Better to try a word with distinct letters and also covering new common letters.

Good candidate: ""PASTA"" -> P,A,S,T,A -> repeated A? Again, same issue.

""PAINT"" -> but N is eliminated -> invalid.

""FAULT"" -> letters: F,A,U,L,T. None of these are in the eliminated set. So: F, A, U, L, T.

But U is not very common? Another word: ""PLAIT"" -> again, has L,T? Wait, A, I, T, etc. But let's avoid uncommon constructs.

""BOAST"" -> B,O,A,S,T. Letters: B,O,A,S,T. All distinct and all new, and avoid eliminated letters.

But note: A must not be in the third position. In ""BOAST"", A is in the third position? 
B O A S T -> A is in position 3? We need to avoid position 3 for A? 
But the feedback says A is in the word but not in the third position. So putting A in third position again might be wasting a spot? However, if we put A in third position and it gets a ✓ then we know the secret word has A in third which contradicts previous feedback? Actually, no: the previous feedback says A is not in third, so if we put A in third and it is marked x then it confirms, but if it gets ✓ that would be impossible? Actually, no because it's a different guess? But the secret word is fixed: we know A is not in the third position, so if we put A in third again and it gets ✓ that would conflict? Therefore, we should avoid position 3 for A.

So in ""BOAST"", A is in position 3 -> not ideal because we know it cannot be there. We need to put A in a different position.

How about:
- Position 1: A? -> e.g., ""ADIEU"" but has E (eliminated) -> invalid.
- Position 2: A? -> e.g., ""HASTY"" -> H,A,S,T,Y -> but H and Y not too common? But acceptable.
- Position 4: A? -> e.g., ""OPALS"" -> O,P,A,L,S -> but note, ""OPALS"" is plural? Maybe acceptable in wordle? Usually allowed if it's a word.

Wordle accepts common nouns, including plurals? But sometimes plurals can be tricky. Let me stick to non-plural.

Another idea: ""STAND"" -> has N (eliminated) -> invalid.
""SHALT"" -> not very common.

A better word: ""PASTY"" -> P,A,S,T,Y -> but A in position 2, and P,S,T,Y are new. This word may be unfamiliar? But it is a word (like the food or resembling paste).

Alternatively: ""MAILS"" -> M,A,I,L,S -> but A in position 2, and it's a common word? M-A-I-L-S. 

But let's systematically think of words that avoid [C,R,N,E] and have A in position not 3.

I recall that starting words like ""AUDIO"" have A and other vowels, but ""AUDIO"" has A in position 1 and avoids our eliminations? Letters: A,U,D,I,O -> no C,R,N,E? Yes.

Moreover, ""AUDIO"" uses vowels and D, but the eliminated letters are consonants? Anyway, it uses new letters.

But we already know A is in the word, so we could try ""AUDIO"" to check multiple vowels. However, it might be better to cover more common consonants.

Another word: ""BAILS"" -> B,A,I,L,S -> A in position 2.

But ""BAILS"" is fine.

Let's list possible words:

Position 1: A
- Words: ""ABIDE"" -> has E -> invalid.
- ""ABOUT"": A,B,O,U,T -> avoids eliminated letters? Yes: A, B, O, U, T -> all clear.

Position 2: A
- ""WAITS"": W,A,I,T,S -> avoids eliminated letters? W,A,I,T,S are not in {C,R,N,E} -> yes.

Position 4: A
- ""FOAMY"": F,O,A,M,Y -> but Y? Valid word? Yes, meaning frothy? Also: ""LOCAL"" has L,O,C,A,L -> C is eliminated -> invalid.

Position 5: A? We can have words ending with A, but that's less common in 5-letter words.

So, strong candidates:

Option 1: ""ABOUT"": A in position 1, and letters: A, B, O, U, T.

Option 2: ""WAIST"": W, A, I, S, T -> A in position 2.

Option 3: ""AUDIO"": A in position 1, U,D,I,O -> checks vowels.

Considering frequency, consonants like T, S, L are more common than U, O. But we also want to cover more frequent letters.

We have already eliminated E and R (which are high frequency), so next are T, O, I, S, etc.

I think ""WAIST"" or ""PASTA"" (but ""PASTA"" has two A's? Let me check: P,A,S,T,A -> repeated A? Actually, letters P,A,S,T -> but spelled P-A-S-T-A so positions: P1: P, P2: A, P3: S, P4: T, P5: A -> so we have two A's? That might be okay, but it reduces diversity.

Avoiding repeated letters is better for information.

So, ""WAIST"": distinct letters: W, A, I, S, T. And T, S are very common.

Similarly, ""ABOUT"" has A,B,O,U,T -> also distinct.

Now, ""AUDIO"": distinct and vowels.

But since we know A is already in the word, testing consonants might yield more information because vowels are less prevalent in positions? 

I think ""WAIST"" is a good choice because it places A in position 2 (not 3) and introduces S, T, W, I. S and T are very common.

Another candidate: ""LASTS"" -> repeated S -> bad.

I think ""WAIST"" is solid.

But let me double-check whether ""WAIST"" is acceptable: it's a word meaning the middle part of the body.

Alternatively, ""CHAOS"" -> but we have C eliminated -> invalid.

Or ""PLAID"" -> but has L and D? Letters: P,L,A,I,D -> avoids eliminations? P,L,A,I,D. Yes. And A is in position 3? Wait, PLAID: P,L,A,I,D -> A in position 3 -> we must avoid that? Yes, because we know A is not in position 3? 

PLAID: 
- Position 3: A -> but we cannot put A in position 3 because we know it's not correct? Actually, we can put it anywhere? But if we put it in position 3 and it comes back as A again in wrong position (because it is not in position 3 in the secret word) then we learn nothing new? Actually, we can: if we put A in position 3 and it gets marked as (-) meaning in the word but wrong position? Then we know the secret word does not have A in position 3 (which we already know) but also we have A in this position so it would be confusing? 

Wait, no: the feedback specifies per letter. If the secret word has an A but not in position 3, then when we put A in position 3, it should yield a ""-"" meaning in the word but wrong position? Exactly as before? But that doesn't tell us anything new. Actually, we already know A is not in position 3? So we can try a position that might be correct? 

But we don't know which position A is in? Only that it is not 3. So we could put A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5? So we have four possibilities? 

Therefore, in the next guess, we should try A in one of the other positions, such as 1 or 2 or 4? 

Therefore, ""WAIST"" has A in position 2 -> promising because if we get a ✓ then we know A is in position 2? 

Similarly, if we put A in position 1? 

Given we want information, placing A in a new position (not 3) is good. 

Now, among ""ABOUT"" and ""WAIST"", both are valid. 

But ""WAIST"" uses W and I? Not as common as T? Actually, ""WAIST"" has T and S? 

Frequency-wise, S is one of the most common? 

I think ""WAIST"" is a good word? Let me search for something better? 

Another word: ""PAID?"" but 4-letter? Wait, 5-letters: ""PALMS"" -> avoids eliminations? P,A,L,M,S -> yes? A in position 2? 

But ""PALMS"" is common? 

Let me stick to ""WAIST""? 

But perhaps a better word is ""SLATE"", but we can't because E is eliminated? 

Given the constraints, let me choose ""WAIST"" as the next guess.

Wait, but let me confirm available letters: no C,R,N,E? So W,A,I,S,T are clean? Yes? And W, I, T, S are new.

So we can expect feedback on A (in position 2) and S,T,W,I? At least we'll learn about these.

Perhaps choose a word with more common consonants than W? W is less common? But S and T are very common? 

Word ""HASTY""? But Y? 

I think ""WAIST"" is acceptable? 

Alternatively, ""TOAST""? But O? Wait, ""TOAST"": T,O,A,S,T -> repeated T? And A in position 3? Oh position? T O A S T -> position 1:T, 2:O, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T -> A in position 3 -> bad? We must avoid position 3 for A? 

So not both repeated letter and in position 3? 

Therefore, I'll go with ""WAIST"". 

So second guess: WAIST

Now, we must format: <guess>waist</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"", we know:
- A is in the secret word but not in position 3 (marked ""-"").
- C, R, N, and E are **not** in the word at all (marked ""x"").
- Therefore, the next guess must include A in a position other than 3 (i.e., position 1, 2, 4, or 5) and avoid using C, R, N, E.

For optimal information gain, the new guess should:
- Contain A in a different position than the previous guess (position 3).
- Use common English letters not yet tested, prioritizing consonants like S, T, L, O, I, etc., which have higher frequency.
- Avoid repeated letters to maximize letter coverage.

Considering these constraints, a strong candidate is ""waist"":
- Places A in position 2 (previously untested position).
- Introduces new common letters: W, S, I, T (all not eliminated).
- Avoids position 3 for A and excludes forbidden letters (C, R, N, E).
- Provides balanced information: tests two vowels (A, I) and three consonants (W, S, T), while targeting a common position for A.

Other options were considered (e.g., ""about"" for position 1 A, ""pasta"" for position 4 A) but ""waist"" uses more frequent consonants (S, T) and avoids repetition or uncommon letters.

Thought process summary: Focus on validating A's position and uncovering new letters efficiently with ""waist"".

Now, we need to make a third guess that:
- Has A in the second position (since it's fixed).
- Does not contain C, R, N, E, W, I, S, or T.
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.
- Is a valid 5-letter English word.

Available letters: Remaining consonants and vowels not excluded. Excluded letters so far: C, R, N, E, W, I, S, T.

Common English letters remaining: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

Since we have A fixed in position 2, the word pattern is: _ A _ _ _

We need to fill the first, third, fourth, and fifth positions with letters from the remaining set.

To maximize information, we should:
- Choose a word with distinct new letters.
- Cover common remaining letters like L, O, U, M, P, etc.

Given the constraints, some possible words:

Option: ""FABLE"" -> But E is eliminated? E is in the excluded list (from guess 1), so no.
Similarly, ""TABLE"" has T (eliminated) and E -> invalid.

Option: ""AMPLE"" -> E eliminated.

Avoiding eliminated letters, let's think of words that fit _ A _ _ _.

Possible words:
- ""BALMY"": B, A, L, M, Y -> Positions: B in 1? A in 2, L in 3, M in 4, Y in 5? And letters: B, L, M, Y? All from available? Yes: B not excluded, L not, M not, Y not? And A fixed.
But check: B, A, L, M, Y. L and M are allowed? Yes? 
Now, is ""BALMY"" a word? Yes, meaning pleasant weather? E.g., ""balmy breeze"".

Another candidate: ""GAMLY""? Not common. Maybe not valid.
""DALLY""? But L in third? Letters: D, A, L, L, Y? Repeated L? Also, D, A, L, Y. With repeated L? Less ideal for info.

Better to have distinct letters? Yes.

Another word: ""HABIT"" -> But T is eliminated? T is excluded? (from ""waist"" feedback: T(x)), so no.

""JAZZY"" repeated Z? Not good.

""KAPUT""? K, A, P, U, T? T excluded? No? T is excluded? Recall: T(x) in guess 2 -> eliminated? Yes? So ""kaput"" has T? Invalid.

Systematically, we have:

First letter: Can be B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, ...? But after A, need letters? Think of the pattern: first letter must be from available consonants? Not necessarily vowel? 

Common possibilities:

- Third letter: Could be vowel like O, U? Or consonant? 

Words:
- ""BASIC"" but S and C excluded? S excluded? Yes? So no.
- ""BAGGY"" repeated G? Not ideal? Also, Y at end? 
But G available? No S excluded? 

Hmm, let's list:

With A in position 2: Possible? 

- ""LABOR"" but L,A,B,O,R? R is excluded? From guess 1 R(x) -> eliminated.
- ""MAJOR""? M,A,J,O,R? R excluded? Also, O? 
""MAJOR"": R excluded -> invalid.

""PADDY"" double D? Not distinct? Also, Y? And D is available? 

Better: ""POLLY"" double L? No repeated? Also O? But O is available? 

Perhaps: ""FLAKY""? F,L,A,K,Y? Letters: F, L, A, K, Y? All available? (no exclusions? C,R,N,E,W,I,S,T excluded -> F,L,K,Y are clean?) Yes? And distinct letters? Yes? 
""FLAKY"" is valid? Meaning unreliable? Yes, English word.

Similarly, another word: ""QUACK"" -> But Q? And includes C? C excluded? No? 

Alternative: ""GLAMY""? Not standard. 

Another: ""VANED"" but N and E excluded? No? N eliminated? From crane: N(x) -> excluded? So no.

So strong candidate: ""FLAKY""? F-L-A-K-Y? 

Third position: could be critical? Currently? Pattern _ A _ _ _

If we guess ""FLAKY"", feedback on F,L,K,Y? 

But we can consider? Also, Y at end? 

Another option: ""BALKY"" -> B,A,L,K,Y? Similar? 

Both ""FLAKY"" and ""BALKY"" are valid.

Which one to choose? For commonness? Or letter frequency?

Remaining high frequency letters: L,O,U,M,P? Etc.

In ""FLAKY"": F,L,K,Y -> F and K less common? L is common? 

Perhaps include O? 

With O: what words? _ A O _ _

For example: ""MAYOR"" but Y? And M? But R excluded? Also? ""MAJOR"" has R? Excluded? 

""RADIO"" R excluded? 

""GAUZE"" has E excluded? 

""FAUNA"" U? And N excluded? N eliminated? 

""HALLO"" double L? Not distinct? 

""MANGO"" M,A,N,G,O? N excluded? Invalid? 

So, hard to include O? 

Another word ""ABOUT"" but O? But in ""ABOUT"" A is in position 2? But we cannot use T? T excluded? And also U? 
""ABODE"" E excluded? 

Perhaps better to stick with L? 

Let me search for available words: 

Another possibility: ""JUMBO"" but J? And A not in second? 

Not fitting? 

""POLAR"" O? But A in fourth? And R excluded? No? 

We must have A in position 2? 

So, back to: 

""FLAKY"": letters F,L,A,K,Y -> yes? 

Or ""BALKY"": B,A,L,K,Y -> both have L,K,Y? And F or B? 

F is less common? Maybe B is better? 

""HAVOC""? H,A,V,O,C? C and O? But C excluded? C from ""crane"" is x? Eliminated? 

""VALID""? V,A,L,I,D? But I excluded? From ""waist"" I(x)? Eliminated? 

So? ""VALET"" E and T excluded? 

Perhaps ""YODEL"" but no A? Position 2 must be A? 

Stuck? 

Or ""GAWKY"" G,A,W,K,Y? But W excluded? From ""waist"" W(x)? Oh, W eliminated? So ""GAWKY"" invalid? 

Therefore, words without W,I,S,T,C,R,N,E? And A in second? 

So L is remaining? 

Thus, valid words: 

Consider ""BALKY"" : B,A,L,K,Y -> available letters? Yes? And distinct? Yes? 

Similarly ""FLAKY"" : F,A,L,K,Y? 

Both are valid, and we can choose either? 

But note: both end with Y? And positions? 

In ""BALKY"": positions: B1, A2, L3, K4, Y5? 

If secret has L? Or? 

But we are testing key positions? 

Alternative word: ""MADAM"" double M and double A? Not good? Avoid? 

""PAPAL"" repeated P? Also A? Not? 

Hard? Another: ""PADDY"" double D? 

So? 

I think ""BALKY"" or ""FLAKY""? 

Perhaps ""GAMER"" E excluded? 

I found ""QUAGGY"" not length? 

So, better to go with ""BALKY"" or ""FLAKY""? 

Decision: ""BALKY"" uses B which is more common than F? Frequency-wise? In English? F and K less common? 

But Y is also? 

To balance? 

Perhaps choose a word that uses M or P? 

For instance: ""AMPLE"" E excluded? 

""MAPLE"" E? Excluded? 

""LAPEL"" L,A,P,E,L? E excluded? 

""RAPED"" E? 

Okay, difficult? 

Another candidate: ""BADLY"" B,A,D,L,Y? Letters: B,D,L,Y? All available? And A? Yes? Distinct? Yes? 

""BADLY"" - adverb meaning poorly? Valid? Yes? Positions: B1, A2, D3, L4, Y5? 

Similarly? 

Compared to ""BALKY""? 

Both have L? ""BADLY"" has D instead of K? 

D is more common? 

Another: ""DAILY"" I? excluded? 

No? 

""FADED"" repeated D? Avoid? 

Therefore, I will choose ""BADLY"" because it uses common letters B, D, L, Y? And D is a new consonant? 

So next guess: ""BADLY""

But confirm: 
- Positions: 1:B, 2:A, 3:D, 4:L, 5:Y? 
- Avoids excluded letters? C,R,N,E,W,I,S,T? Yes? 
- Includes A fixed in 2? Yes? 

So <guess>badly</guess>? 

But note: with feedback, this tests D in position 3, L in position 4, Y in position 5? 

Alternatively? 

Another word? ""HARDY"" H,A,R,D,Y? R excluded? 

""LARDY"" L,A,R,D,Y? R excluded? 

So ""BADLY"" seems solid? 

Perhaps ""PADDY"" double D? But with D? Let's see if repetition is worth? But less informative? 

So I think ""BADLY"" is good? 

Final choice: ""BADLY""

Therefore, guessed word: badlyBased on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: A is in the word but not in position 3. C, R, N, E are not in the word.
- **Guess 2 (""waist"")**: A is confirmed in position 2! W, I, S, T are not in the word.

**Inferences**:
- The secret word has **A in position 2**: pattern is `_ A _ _ _`.
- Eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, W, I, S, T. Future guesses must avoid these.
- Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

**Strategy for third guess**:
- Keep **A in position 2**.
- Choose a word with distinct, common unused letters to maximize information gain (e.g., focus on consonants like B, D, L, M).
- Avoid eliminated letters and position 3 for A (already known wrong).

Strong candidate: **BADLY** (B1, A2, D3, L4, Y5).  
- Why?  
  - Uses new common consonants (B, D, L) and tests Y.  
  - Avoids repetition and uses high-frequency letters: D and L are among top English frequencies.  
  - Valid word: adjective/adverb meaning ""in a poor or inadequate way"".  
- Expected outcomes:  
  - If B, D, L, or Y get `✓`, their positions are solved.  
  - If `-`, letters are correct but misplaced.  
  - If `x`, letters are eliminated, narrowing options further.

<guess>badly</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: waist -> FEEDBACK: W(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) T(x)
Guess 3: badly -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) D(x) L(x) Y(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
  - A is in the word but not in position 3.
  - C, R, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""waist"" -> W(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) T(x)
  - A is correct and in position 2 (so the word has A as the second letter).
  - W, I, S, T are not in the word.

Guess 3: ""badly"" -> B(x) A(✓) D(x) L(x) Y(✓)
  - A is still correct in position 2 (as expected).
  - Y is correct and in position 5 (so the word ends with Y).
  - B, D, L are not in the word.

Now, combining all feedback:

- The word has the pattern: _ A _ _ Y
- A is in position 2, Y in position 5.
- Eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, W, I, S, T, B, D, L
- We know the word must have two more letters (positions 1 and 3) and one more letter in position 4? Actually, positions 1, 3, and 4? Wait, no: the word is 5 letters: position 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
  - Position 2: A (fixed)
  - Position 5: Y (fixed)
  - Positions 1, 3, and 4 are unknown.

But note: we have eliminated many letters. The remaining letters are from the set: F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Z.

Also, we must consider that the word has exactly 5 letters, and we know two of them (A and Y) and their positions.

Now, we need to find a word that fits: [letter1] A [letter3] [letter4] Y

With letter1, letter3, letter4 from the remaining letters: F,G,H,J,K,M,O,P,Q,U,V,X,Z.

Moreover, we have no information about letter4 yet? But in the pattern, it's the fourth letter.

We must also consider that the word might have repeated letters? But so far, we haven't seen any, but it's possible? However, we have eliminated many, so we can avoid repetition for now.

Now, we need to make a guess that uses letters from the remaining set to test positions 1, 3, and 4.

Common letters remaining: G, H, K, M, O, P, U, V? (F, J, Q, X, Z are less common)

We should try to cover as many common letters as possible in one guess.

Possible words that fit the pattern and use only available letters:

- ""HAPPY"": but H is available? And P? But double P? Also, A is in 2, Y in 5? So H A P P Y? But we have two P's? And we don't know if P is in the word? But we can use it? However, repeated P? Not ideal for information? But if we get feedback, we can learn? But let's see.

But note: we have eliminated B, D, L? So ""HAPPY"" uses H, A, P, P, Y? But A and Y are fixed? So we are testing H in position 1 and P in positions 3 and 4? But repeated P? So if P is in the word, we might get partial feedback? But it's acceptable? However, we might get less information.

Better to avoid repetition? So let's try for distinct letters.

What words? 

- ""GAMMY"": G A M M Y? Double M? Not distinct.

- ""JAMMY"": J A M M Y? Double M? Also, J is less common.

- ""MAYBE"": but E is eliminated? And B eliminated? 

- ""PAPPY"": double P? 

- ""HAPPY"" as above? 

But let's think: 

- ""HAPPY"": H in 1, A in 2, P in 3, P in 4, Y in 5? 

But we don't know if P is in the word? 

Alternatively, ""GASSY"": but S eliminated? 

""HAVOC"": H A V O C? But C eliminated? 

""JAZZY"": double Z? 

""MAUVE"": M A U V E? E eliminated? 

""PADDY"": D eliminated? 

""FANNY"": F A N N Y? N eliminated? 

""JAGGY"": J A G G Y? Double G? 

""KAPPA"": K A P P A? Double P and A? But A is already known? And we don't know if A is repeated? But in position 1? But we have A in 2? So if we put A in 1? But we know A is in 2? So if we put A in 1, it would be marked as (-) if present? But we know it's in 2? So putting A in 1 would be wrong? And we know it's not in 1? Because it's in 2? Actually, we don't know if there is another A? But from feedback, we only know one A? But it could be repeated? 

But in ""badly"", we had A in 2 and it was ✓, and we didn't test other positions? So it's possible? 

But to avoid complexity, let's assume no repetition for now? 

So, words with distinct letters? 

Pattern: [1] A [3] [4] Y

Available letters: F,G,H,J,K,M,O,P,Q,U,V,X,Z

Try to form a word? 

- ""HAPPY"" has repeated P? 

- ""GAMMY"" repeated M? 

- ""JUMBO"" but no Y? 

- ""HUMAN"" N eliminated? 

- ""GAYAL"" G A Y A L? But Y is in 5? And A in 2? So G A Y A L? That would be positions: 1:G, 2:A, 3:Y? But Y is fixed at 5? So conflict? 

We need Y at 5? 

So, ""GAYLY""? G A Y L Y? But Y at 3 and 5? And L? But L eliminated? 

Not? 

""JOKEY"": J O K E Y? E eliminated? 

""POKEY"": P O K E Y? E eliminated? 

""MAKEY""? Not a word? 

""FOGGY"": double G? 

""BUGGY"": double G? 

""MUMMY"": double M? 

""PUPPY"": double P? 

It's hard to find a word with distinct letters? 

Perhaps ""HAVOC"" but C eliminated? 

""JACKY"": C and K? But C eliminated? 

""QUACK"": C eliminated? 

""QUAFF"": Q U A F F? Double F? 

""QUAGY""? Not a word? 

""VAGUE"": G U? But E eliminated? 

""VAMPY""? Not common? 

""WACKY"": W eliminated? 

So, maybe we have to accept a word with repeated letters? 

Another idea: ""HAPPY"" is a common word? 

But let's see if there is a word without repetition? 

""GAZPY""? Not a word? 

""KAPOK"": K A P O K? But K repeated? 

""MAVIE""? Not? 

""PAVKY""? Not? 

""OAKUM"": O A K U M? But O in 1? A in 2? K in 3? U in 4? M in 5? But we need Y in 5? So not? 

We need Y at 5? 

So, the word must end with Y? 

Therefore, position 4 must be a letter that can come before Y? 

Commonly? 

For example: ""HAPPY"" has P before Y? 

""FUNKY"": F U N K Y? N eliminated? 

""JUMPY"": J U M P Y? This is a word? Meaning nervous? Yes? 

Letters: J, U, M, P, Y? All available? And distinct? 

Yes! J, U, M, P, Y? 

And pattern: J A? Wait, no: we have to put A in 2? 

""JUMPY"" is J U M P Y? But we need A in position 2? 

So we cannot use ""JUMPY"" because it doesn't have A? 

We must have A in position 2? 

So the word is: [1] A [3] [4] Y

So we need a word that has A in second and Y in fifth? 

""JUMPY"" doesn't have A? 

So not? 

Another word: ""GIPSY"": G I P S Y? But I and S eliminated? 

""TIPSY"": T and S eliminated? 

""POPPY"": double P? 

""DUMPY"": D eliminated? 

""GUPPY"": G U P P Y? Double P? 

""HUMPY"": H U M P Y? But M and P? And H? 

But ""HUMPY"" is a word? Meaning having humps? Yes? 

But pattern: H U M P Y? But we need A in position 2? So not? 

We must have A in position 2? 

So, let's list possible words that fit _ A _ _ Y and use available letters? 

- ""HAPPY"": H A P P Y? Uses H, P? And repeated P? 

- ""JAPAN"": J A P A N? But N eliminated? 

- ""KAPPA"": K A P P A? Double P and A? 

- ""PAPAY"": not a word? 

- ""QADDI"": not? 

- ""RABBY"": R eliminated? 

- ""SABBY"": S eliminated? 

- ""TABBY"": T eliminated? 

- ""HABIT"": H A B I T? B and I and T eliminated? 

- ""FADDY"": F A D D Y? D eliminated? 

- ""GADDY"": G A D D Y? D eliminated? 

- ""LADDY"": L and D eliminated? 

- ""MADLY"": M A D L Y? D and L eliminated? 

- ""PALLY"": P A L L Y? L eliminated? 

- ""RALLY"": R and L eliminated? 

- ""SALLY"": S and L eliminated? 

- ""TALLY"": T and L eliminated? 

- ""WALLY"": W and L eliminated? 

- ""FANNY"": F A N N Y? N eliminated? 

- ""CANNY"": C and N eliminated? 

- ""FUNNY"": F U N N Y? N eliminated? 

- ""GUNNY"": G U N N Y? N eliminated? 

- ""HONEY"": H O N E Y? N and E eliminated? 

- ""MONEY"": M O N E Y? N and E eliminated? 

- ""PINEY"": P I N E Y? I, N, E eliminated? 

- ""VINNY"": V I N N Y? I and N eliminated? 

- ""BAGGY"": B and G? B eliminated? 

- ""CABBY"": C and B eliminated? 

- ""DADDY"": D eliminated? 

- ""JAGGY"": J A G G Y? Double G? 

- ""JAZZY"": J A Z Z Y? Double Z? 

- ""KARMA"": K A R M A? R eliminated? 

- ""MANGA"": M A N G A? N eliminated? 

- ""PAGAN"": P A G A N? N eliminated? 

- ""VAGAL"": V A G A L? L eliminated? 

- ""WAGON"": W and G? W eliminated? 

- ""YAHOO"": Y A H O O? But Y is at 1? But we need Y at 5? 

So, after this, it seems ""HAPPY"" is a possible word? 

But we have not eliminated H or P? 

Another word: ""GAUPY""? Not a word? 

""JAUKY""? J A U K Y? This is a word? Meaning shy? Rare? 

""MAUZY""? Not? 

""PAUKY""? P A U K Y? Meaning cunning? Scottish? 

But let's stick to common words? 

""HAZY"": only 4 letters? 

""HAYEY""? H A Y E Y? But E eliminated? And Y at 3? 

Not? 

So, perhaps ""HAPPY"" is the most common? 

But we have to consider that P might be repeated? 

Another common word: ""GASSY"" but S eliminated? 

""NASTY"" N and S and T eliminated? 

So, I think we have to go with ""HAPPY"" or similar? 

But note: in ""HAPPY"", we are testing H in position 1 and P in positions 3 and 4? 

If we guess ""HAPPY"", and if the word is ""HAPPY"", we win? 

But if not, we get feedback on H and P? 

For example, if H is not in the word, it will be x? And P? If P is in the word, we might get - or ✓ for the positions? 

But since we have two P's, if one P is correct, we get one ✓ and one -? Or if both wrong, then x? 

But it's acceptable? 

To avoid repetition, is there a word with distinct letters? 

Let me try: ""JAMBU""? Not? 

""KAMIK"": K A M I K? I eliminated? 

""MAHOE"": M A H O E? E eliminated? 

""PAGLE""? Not? 

""QUAHAUG"": too long? 

""QUAKY"": Q U A K Y? But U in position 2? But we need A in 2? So ""Q U A K Y"" has U in 1, A in 2, K in 3, Y in 4? But we need 5 letters? ""QUAKY"" is 5: Q-U-A-K-Y? Positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:A, 4:K, 5:Y? But we need A in position 2? Here A is in position 3? So not? 

We need A in position 2? 

So, ""QUAKY"" has A in 3? Not 2? 

Another: ""GAWKY"": G A W K Y? But W eliminated? 

So, I think we have to use a word with repeated letters? 

But let's try ""HAPPY"" for now? 

But there is ""HANKY"": H A N K Y? N eliminated? 

""PARKY"": P A R K Y? R eliminated? 

""FJORD"": no A? 

So, I think ""HAPPY"" is a valid guess? 

But let's see if there is a word like ""HAPPY"" but without repetition? 

""HAVOC"" not? 

""JACKY"" not? 

""PADDY"" not? 

""GAFFY"": G A F F Y? Double F? 

""GAFFY"" is a word? Meaning hook? Rare? 

""JAFFA"": J A F F A? Double F and A? 

Not distinct? 

So, I will go with ""HAPPY"" as the next guess? 

But note: we have not used M, O, U, V, etc.? 

Another word: ""HUMOR"" no Y? 

""MAYOR"" M A Y O R? But Y in 3? And R eliminated? 

Not? 

""PUDGY"" P U D G Y? D eliminated? 

So, ""HAPPY"" seems the best option? 

Therefore, fourth guess: ""HAPPY"" 

But let's format: <guess>happy</guess> 

But we have to be careful: if the word is not ""HAPPY"", we get feedback? 

For example, if H is not in the word, and P is not, then we get all x except A and Y? 

But then we have to try other letters? 

But we have only 3 guesses left? 

We have used 3, so this is the fourth? 

But let's proceed? 

Perhaps there is a better word? 

Another idea: ""JUMPY"" is not possible? 

Or ""GAMMY"" double M? 

But ""GAMMY"" is a word? Meaning lame? 

G A M M Y? Pattern: G1, A2, M3, M4, Y5? 

But repeated M? 

Similarly, ""HAPPY"" has repeated P? 

But both are similar? 

I think ""HAPPY"" is more common? 

So I'll go with that.### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
  - Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
    - A is in the word but not in position 3.  
    - C, R, N, E are eliminated (not in the word).  

- **Guess 2: ""waist""**  
  - Feedback: W(x), A(✓), I(x), S(x), T(x)  
    - A is confirmed in position 2.  
    - W, I, S, T are eliminated.  

- **Guess 3: ""badly""**  
  - Feedback: B(x), A(✓), D(x), L(x), Y(✓)  
    - A is confirmed in position 2 (redundant but consistent).  
    - Y is confirmed in position 5.  
    - B, D, L are eliminated.  

### Key Inferences
- **Word pattern**: The secret word must be `_ A _ _ Y` (A in position 2, Y in position 5).  
- **Eliminated letters (13 total)**: C, R, N, E, W, I, S, T, B, D, L.  
- **Available letters (13 remaining)**: F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Z.  
- **Constraints for next guess**:  
  - Must include A in position 2 and Y in position 5.  
  - Positions 1, 3, and 4 must use letters from the available set.  
  - Avoid eliminated letters.  
- **Strategy for Guess 4**:  
  - Prioritize common letters from the available set (e.g., H, P, M, K, G) to maximize information.  
  - Test multiple positions (1, 3, 4) simultaneously.  
  - Given the limited options, repetition may be unavoidable, but distinct letters are preferred for better information gain.  
  - After evaluating possible words (e.g., ""happy"", ""gamy"", ""jumpy""), ""happy"" is selected because:  
    - It uses common letters (H, P).  
    - It tests H in position 1 and P in positions 3 and 4 (repetition is necessary due to word constraints).  
    - If ""happy"" is incorrect, feedback on H and P will significantly narrow possibilities (e.g., if P is correct, it reveals position; if not, P is eliminated).  
    - It is a valid English word.  

### Next Guess: ""happy""  
- **Pattern**: H (position 1), A (position 2), P (position 3), P (position 4), Y (position 5).  
- **Expected outcomes**:  
  - If H is `✓`, position 1 is solved. If `x`, H is eliminated.  
  - If P is `✓` in position 3 or 4, that position is solved. If `-`, P is in the word but misplaced. If `x`, P is eliminated.  
  - Feedback will reduce the solution space for the final guess(es).

Guess 3: badly -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) D(x) L(x) Y(✓)
Guess 4: happy -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) P(x) P(x) Y(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
  - A is in the word but not in position 3.
  - C, R, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""waist"" -> W(x), A(✓), I(x), S(x), T(x)
  - A is correct and in position 2 (so the word has A as the second letter).
  - W, I, S, T are not in the word.

Guess 3: ""badly"" -> B(x), A(✓), D(x), L(x), Y(✓)
  - A is still correct in position 2 (as expected).
  - Y is correct and in position 5 (so the word ends with Y).
  - B, D, L are not in the word.

Guess 4: ""happy"" -> H(x), A(✓), P(x), P(x), Y(✓)
  - A and Y are still correct in positions 2 and 5.
  - H is not in the word.
  - P is not in the word (both instances are marked x, so P is eliminated).

Combining all feedback:
- The word pattern is: _ A _ _ Y
- A is in position 2, Y in position 5.
- Eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, W, I, S, T, B, D, L, H, P (from the above, plus H and P from guess 4).
- Available letters: F, G, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, X, Z (since H and P are now eliminated).

We need to form a 5-letter word of the form [1] A [3] [4] Y, using only the available letters.

Available letters: F, G, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, X, Z

We must choose letters for positions 1, 3, and 4 from these.

Now, we need to find a valid English word that fits this pattern.

Possible words:

- ""GAMMY"": G A M M Y? But M is repeated? And we don't know if M is available? It is. But let's check: G, A, M, M, Y? Positions: G1, A2, M3, M4, Y5? But repeated M? And is ""GAMMY"" a word? Yes, meaning lame or not working properly (British slang). But we have two M's? That might be acceptable? But we are testing M? However, if we use repeated M, we get less information? But we have to work with the available letters.

- ""JAMMY"": J A M M Y? Similarly, double M? Meaning lucky? Also a word.

- ""MAYBE"": But E is eliminated? And B eliminated? Not.

- ""FAKEY"": F A K E Y? E eliminated? Not.

- ""JAZZY"": J A Z Z Y? Double Z? But Z is available? And ""JAZZY"" is a word? Yes? But pattern: J1, A2, Z3, Z4, Y5? But we have two Z's? And we don't know if Z is in the word? But we can try? 

- ""GAZKY""? Not a word.

- ""KAMME""? Not a word.

- ""MAUVE"": M A U V E? E eliminated? Not.

- ""OAKUM"": O A K U M? But O in 1? A in 2? K in 3? U in 4? M in 5? But we need Y in 5? So not? 

We need Y at 5? So the word must end with Y? 

Therefore, position 4 must be a letter that can come before Y? 

Commonly? 

For example: ""GAMMY"" has M before Y? 

""JAZZY"" has Z before Y? 

But let's list possible words? 

Another: ""FOGGY"": F O G G Y? But O? And double G? But G is available? But ""FOGGY"" has O in 2? But we need A in 2? So not? 

We must have A in 2? 

So, words: 

- ""GAMMY"": G A M M Y? Valid? Yes? 

- ""JAMMY"": J A M M Y? Valid? Yes? 

- ""MAMMY"": M A M M Y? Triple M? Not? ""MAMMY"" is M A M M Y? Positions: M1, A2, M3, M4, Y5? So M in 1,3,4? But repeated? And ""mammy"" is a word? Yes? But we have three M's? 

But we can use? 

- ""MAYOR"": M A Y O R? But Y in 3? And R eliminated? Not? 

- ""VAMPY"": V A M P Y? But P eliminated? 

- ""WAVEY"": W eliminated? 

- ""ZAPPY"": Z A P P Y? P eliminated? 

- ""QUAKY"": Q U A K Y? But A in 3? Not 2? 

- ""QUAFF"": Not 5 letters? 

- ""QUAGY"": Not a word? 

- ""JUMBY"": J U M B Y? B eliminated? 

- ""MUMBO"": M U M B O? No Y? 

- ""FUMED"": E and D eliminated? 

So, the only common words seem to be ""GAMMY"" and ""JAMMY""? 

But both have double M? 

Another possibility: ""GAUMY"": G A U M Y? This is a word? Meaning sticky? Yes? And distinct letters? G, A, U, M, Y? 

Yes! ""GAUMY"" has distinct letters? 

Pattern: G1, A2, U3, M4, Y5? 

And letters: G, U, M, Y? All available? 

Similarly, ""JAUKY"": J A U K Y? Meaning shy? Rare? But valid? 

""MAUZY"": Not common? 

""OAKY"": Only 4 letters? 

""VAGUY""? Not? 

So, ""GAUMY"" is a valid word with distinct letters? 

Therefore, we can use ""GAUMY"" to test G, U, M? 

Similarly, ""JAZZY"" has repeated Z? 

But ""GAUMY"" is better? 

Another: ""GUCKY""? Not? 

""JOCKY"": J O C K Y? C eliminated? 

""JUKED"": E and D eliminated? 

""JUMAR"": No Y? 

So, I think ""GAUMY"" is a good choice? 

But let's confirm: 

- Position 1: G? 
- Position 2: A (fixed)
- Position 3: U? 
- Position 4: M? 
- Position 5: Y (fixed)

Letters: G, U, M? All available? 

Yes? 

So, we can guess ""GAUMY""? 

But is it common? It might be obscure? 

Alternative: ""GAMMY"" is more common? But repeated M? 

But for information, distinct letters are better? 

So, I'll go with ""GAUMY"" as the next guess? 

Therefore, fifth guess: ""GAUMY"" 

But note: we have only 2 guesses left? 

We have used 4, so this is the fifth? 

But let's hope it's correct? 

If not, we get feedback? 

So, <guess>gaumy</guess> 

But let's make sure: 

Available letters: F, G, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, X, Z? 

G, U, M are available? 

Yes? 

And we avoid eliminated? 

Yes? 

So, guessed word: gaumy### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
  - Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
    - A is in the word but not in position 3.  
    - C, R, N, E are eliminated.  

- **Guess 2: ""waist""**  
  - Feedback: W(x), A(✓), I(x), S(x), T(x)  
    - A is confirmed in position 2.  
    - W, I, S, T are eliminated.  

- **Guess 3: ""badly""**  
  - Feedback: B(x), A(✓), D(x), L(x), Y(✓)  
    - A (position 2) and Y (position 5) are confirmed.  
    - B, D, L are eliminated.  

- **Guess 4: ""happy""**  
  - Feedback: H(x), A(✓), P(x), P(x), Y(✓)  
    - A (position 2) and Y (position 5) reconfirmed.  
    - H and P are eliminated (both P instances marked ""x"" confirm P is absent).  

### Key Inferences
- **Word pattern**: The secret word is `_ A _ _ Y` (A in position 2, Y in position 5).  
- **Eliminated letters (15 total)**: C, R, N, E, W, I, S, T, B, D, L, H, P.  
- **Available letters (11 remaining)**: F, G, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, X, Z.  
- **Strategy for Guess 5**:  
  - Must retain **A in position 2** and **Y in position 5**.  
  - Positions 1, 3, and 4 must use letters from the available set.  
  - Prioritize **distinct, common letters** to maximize information (e.g., G, M, U).  
  - After evaluating options:  
    - ""gaumy"" (G1, A2, U3, M4, Y5) is optimal:  
      - Uses distinct letters (G, U, M) to test high-frequency consonants (G, M) and a vowel (U).  
      - Valid English word (archaic term for ""sticky"" or ""clumsy"").  
      - Tests positions 1, 3, and 4 efficiently.  
    - Alternatives like ""gummy"" (repeated M) or ""jazzy"" (repeated Z, uncommon) are inferior for information gain.  

### Next Guess: ""gaumy""  
- **Expected outcomes**:  
  - If G is `✓`, position 1 is solved. If `x`, G is eliminated.  
  - If U is `✓`/`-`, it reveals position 3. If `x`, U is eliminated.  
  - If M is `✓`/`-`, it reveals position 4. If `x`, M is eliminated.  
- **Win condition**: If ""gaumy"" is correct, the game ends. Otherwise, feedback narrows to 1-2 possibilities for the final guess.

Since we have no prior feedback, I need to choose a word that maximizes information gain. The best starting words usually contain common letters and avoid repetition. \n\nCommon English letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S. I should pick a word that uses several of these. ""ROATE"" is often recommended as it covers frequent letters like R, O, A, T, E.

Each uses five distinct common letters. Among these, ""CRANE"" stands out because:\n- C appears in many words though not top tier frequency\n- R, A, E are top-10 frequency letters\n- N is also relatively common\n\nThis covers vowel/consonant balance well. After comparison...For the first guess, selecting a word with diverse and common letters increases chances of hitting relevant letters in the secret word.

We have eliminated 4 letters: C, R, N, E. The remaining available letters are most of the alphabet. We should pick a word that includes A and four new letters that are common to get more information.\n\nCommon English letters remaining: S, T, O, I, L, D, U, M, P, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, V, J, X, Q, Z.\n\nWe can choose a word that starts with or contains A and avoids the eliminated letters.\n\nWe also note that A cannot be in position 3.\n\nIdeally, we place A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\nLet\'s think of common words that contain A and four other common letters not in {C,R,N,E}.\n\nSome possibilities:\n- Using the letter A and other high frequency letters: S, T, L, I, O, etc.\n\nWord ideas:\n- ""SLATE"": but we must avoid E because it was eliminated? Wait, E is eliminated -> x meaning not present, so we cannot use E. ""SLATE"" has E which is eliminated.\n- ""PLANT"": has N which is eliminated -> cannot use N.\n- ""TRAIL"": has R which is eliminated -> discard.\n- ""FLAIL"": has L twice and R? Wait, R is eliminated -> discard.\n\nWe need to avoid C, R, N, E.\n\nLet\'s try words with A and other available letters.\n\nGood words might include ""SAVOR"", ""STOMP"", but they don\'t have A? We must include A because we know it is in the word.\n\nSo, words that have A and avoid C,R,N,E:\n\nPossible words: \n- ""SALAD"" -> but double A? Actually, double A may not be ideal because we don\'t know if the secret word has two A\'s. But it\'s acceptable if we don\'t have a better word. However, note that in ""SALAD"", A is in position 2 and 4? But we have only one A in the secret word? Actually, we don\'t know, but for information, using repeated letters is less informative.\n\nBetter to try a word with distinct letters and also covering new common letters.\n\nGood candidate: ""PASTA"" -> P,A,S,T,A -> repeated A? Again, same issue.\n\n""PAINT"" -> but N is eliminated -> invalid.\n\n""FAULT"" -> letters: F,A,U,L,T. None of these are in the eliminated set. So: F, A, U, L, T.\n\nBut U is not very common? Another word: ""PLAIT"" -> again, has L,T? Wait, A, I, T, etc. But let\'s avoid uncommon constructs.\n\n""BOAST"" -> B,O,A,S,T. Letters: B,O,A,S,T. All distinct and all new, and avoid eliminated letters.\n\nBut note: A must not be in the third position. In ""BOAST"", A is in the third position? \nB O A S T -> A is in position 3? We need to avoid position 3 for A? \nBut the feedback says A is in the word but not in the third position. So putting A in third position again might be wasting a spot? However, if we put A in third position and it gets a ✓ then we know the secret word has A in third which contradicts previous feedback? Actually, no: the previous feedback says A is not in third, so if we put A in third and it is marked x then it confirms, but if it gets ✓ that would be impossible? Actually, no because it\'s a different guess? But the secret word is fixed: we know A is not in the third position, so if we put A in third again and it gets ✓ that would conflict? Therefore, we should avoid position 3 for A.\n\nSo in ""BOAST"", A is in position 3 -> not ideal because we know it cannot be there. We need to put A in a different position.\n\nHow about:\n- Position 1: A? -> e.g., ""ADIEU"" but has E (eliminated) -> invalid.\n- Position 2: A? -> e.g., ""HASTY"" -> H,A,S,T,Y -> but H and Y not too common? But acceptable.\n- Position 4: A? -> e.g., ""OPALS"" -> O,P,A,L,S -> but note, ""OPALS"" is plural? Maybe acceptable in wordle? Usually allowed if it\'s a word.\n\nWordle accepts common nouns, including plurals? But sometimes plurals can be tricky. Let me stick to non-plural.\n\nAnother idea: ""STAND"" -> has N (eliminated) -> invalid.\n""SHALT"" -> not very common.\n\nA better word: ""PASTY"" -> P,A,S,T,Y -> but A in position 2, and P,S,T,Y are new. This word may be unfamiliar? But it is a word (like the food or resembling paste).\n\nAlternatively: ""MAILS"" -> M,A,I,L,S -> but A in position 2, and it\'s a common word? M-A-I-L-S. \n\nBut let\'s systematically think of words that avoid [C,R,N,E] and have A in position not 3.\n\nI recall that starting words like ""AUDIO"" have A and other vowels, but ""AUDIO"" has A in position 1 and avoids our eliminations? Letters: A,U,D,I,O -> no C,R,N,E? Yes.\n\nMoreover, ""AUDIO"" uses vowels and D, but the eliminated letters are consonants? Anyway, it uses new letters.\n\nBut we already know A is in the word, so we could try ""AUDIO"" to check multiple vowels. However, it might be better to cover more common consonants.\n\nAnother word: ""BAILS"" -> B,A,I,L,S -> A in position 2.\n\nBut ""BAILS"" is fine.\n\nLet\'s list possible words:\n\nPosition 1: A\n- Words: ""ABIDE"" -> has E -> invalid.\n- ""ABOUT"": A,B,O,U,T -> avoids eliminated letters? Yes: A, B, O, U, T -> all clear.\n\nPosition 2: A\n- ""WAITS"": W,A,I,T,S -> avoids eliminated letters? W,A,I,T,S are not in {C,R,N,E} -> yes.\n\nPosition 4: A\n- ""FOAMY"": F,O,A,M,Y -> but Y? Valid word? Yes, meaning frothy? Also: ""LOCAL"" has L,O,C,A,L -> C is eliminated -> invalid.\n\nPosition 5: A? We can have words ending with A, but that\'s less common in 5-letter words.\n\nSo, strong candidates:\n\nOption 1: ""ABOUT"": A in position 1, and letters: A, B, O, U, T.\n\nOption 2: ""WAIST"": W, A, I, S, T -> A in position 2.\n\nOption 3: ""AUDIO"": A in position 1, U,D,I,O -> checks vowels.\n\nConsidering frequency, consonants like T, S, L are more common than U, O. But we also want to cover more frequent letters.\n\nWe have already eliminated E and R (which are high frequency), so next are T, O, I, S, etc.\n\nI think ""WAIST"" or ""PASTA"" (but ""PASTA"" has two A\'s? Let me check: P,A,S,T,A -> repeated A? Actually, letters P,A,S,T -> but spelled P-A-S-T-A so positions: P1: P, P2: A, P3: S, P4: T, P5: A -> so we have two A\'s? That might be okay, but it reduces diversity.\n\nAvoiding repeated letters is better for information.\n\nSo, ""WAIST"": distinct letters: W, A, I, S, T. And T, S are very common.\n\nSimilarly, ""ABOUT"" has A,B,O,U,T -> also distinct.\n\nNow, ""AUDIO"": distinct and vowels.\n\nBut since we know A is already in the word, testing consonants might yield more information because vowels are less prevalent in positions? \n\nI think ""WAIST"" is a good choice because it places A in position 2 (not 3) and introduces S, T, W, I. S and T are very common.\n\nAnother candidate: ""LASTS"" -> repeated S -> bad.\n\nI think ""WAIST"" is solid.\n\nBut let me double-check whether ""WAIST"" is acceptable: it\'s a word meaning the middle part of the body.\n\nAlternatively, ""CHAOS"" -> but we have C eliminated -> invalid.\n\nOr ""PLAID"" -> but has L and D? Letters: P,L,A,I,D -> avoids eliminations? P,L,A,I,D. Yes. And A is in position 3? Wait, PLAID: P,L,A,I,D -> A in position 3 -> we must avoid that? Yes, because we know A is not in position 3? \n\nPLAID: \n- Position 3: A -> but we cannot put A in position 3 because we know it\'s not correct? Actually, we can put it anywhere? But if we put it in position 3 and it comes back as A again in wrong position (because it is not in position 3 in the secret word) then we learn nothing new? Actually, we can: if we put A in position 3 and it gets marked as (-) meaning in the word but wrong position? Then we know the secret word does not have A in position 3 (which we already know) but also we have A in this position so it would be confusing? \n\nWait, no: the feedback specifies per letter. If the secret word has an A but not in position 3, then when we put A in position 3, it should yield a ""-"" meaning in the word but wrong position? Exactly as before? But that doesn\'t tell us anything new. Actually, we already know A is not in position 3? So we can try a position that might be correct? \n\nBut we don\'t know which position A is in? Only that it is not 3. So we could put A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5? So we have four possibilities? \n\nTherefore, in the next guess, we should try A in one of the other positions, such as 1 or 2 or 4? \n\nTherefore, ""WAIST"" has A in position 2 -> promising because if we get a ✓ then we know A is in position 2? \n\nSimilarly, if we put A in position 1? \n\nGiven we want information, placing A in a new position (not 3) is good. \n\nNow, among ""ABOUT"" and ""WAIST"", both are valid. \n\nBut ""WAIST"" uses W and I? Not as common as T? Actually, ""WAIST"" has T and S? \n\nFrequency-wise, S is one of the most common? \n\nI think ""WAIST"" is a good word? Let me search for something better? \n\nAnother word: ""PAID?"" but 4-letter? Wait, 5-letters: ""PALMS"" -> avoids eliminations? P,A,L,M,S -> yes? A in position 2? \n\nBut ""PALMS"" is common? \n\nLet me stick to ""WAIST""? \n\nBut perhaps a better word is ""SLATE"", but we can\'t because E is eliminated? \n\nGiven the constraints, let me choose ""WAIST"" as the next guess.\n\nWait, but let me confirm available letters: no C,R,N,E? So W,A,I,S,T are clean? Yes? And W, I, T, S are new.\n\nSo we can expect feedback on A (in position 2) and S,T,W,I? At least we\'ll learn about these.\n\nPerhaps choose a word with more common consonants than W? W is less common? But S and T are very common? \n\nWord ""HASTY""? But Y? \n\nI think ""WAIST"" is acceptable? \n\nAlternatively, ""TOAST""? But O? Wait, ""TOAST"": T,O,A,S,T -> repeated T? And A in position 3? Oh position? T O A S T -> position 1:T, 2:O, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T -> A in position 3 -> bad?

Think of the pattern: first letter must be from available consonants? Not necessarily vowel? \n\nCommon possibilities:\n\n- Third letter: Could be vowel like O, U? Or consonant? \n\nWords:\n- ""BASIC"" but S and C excluded? S excluded? Yes? So no.\n- ""BAGGY"" repeated G? Not ideal? Also, Y at end? \nBut G available?

Etc.\n\nIn ""FLAKY"": F,L,K,Y -> F and K less common? L is common? \n\nPerhaps include O? \n\nWith O: what words? _ A O _ _\n\nFor example: ""MAYOR"" but Y? And M? But R excluded? Also?

And A not in second? \n\nNot fitting? \n\n""POLAR"" O? But A in fourth? And R excluded? No? \n\nWe must have A in position 2? \n\nSo, back to: \n\n""FLAKY"": letters F,L,A,K,Y -> yes? \n\nOr ""BALKY"": B,A,L,K,Y -> both have L,K,Y? And F or B? \n\nF is less common?

""VALET"" E and T excluded? \n\nPerhaps ""YODEL"" but no A? Position 2 must be A? \n\nStuck? \n\nOr ""GAWKY"" G,A,W,K,Y? But W excluded? From ""waist"" W(x)? Oh, W eliminated? So ""GAWKY"" invalid? \n\nTherefore, words without W,I,S,T,C,R,N,E? And A in second? \n\nSo L is remaining? \n\nThus, valid words: \n\nConsider ""BALKY"" : B,A,L,K,Y -> available letters? Yes? And distinct? Yes? \n\nSimilarly ""FLAKY"" : F,A,L,K,Y? \n\nBoth are valid, and we can choose either? \n\nBut note: both end with Y? And positions? \n\nIn ""BALKY"": positions: B1, A2, L3, K4, Y5? \n\nIf secret has L? Or? \n\nBut we are testing key positions? \n\nAlternative word: ""MADAM"" double M and double A? Not good? Avoid? \n\n""PAPAL"" repeated P? Also A? Not? \n\nHard? Another: ""PADDY"" double D? \n\nSo? \n\nI think ""BALKY"" or ""FLAKY""? \n\nPerhaps ""GAMER"" E excluded? \n\nI found ""QUAGGY"" not length? \n\nSo, better to go with ""BALKY"" or ""FLAKY""? \n\nDecision: ""BALKY"" uses B which is more common than F? Frequency-wise? In English? F and K less common? \n\nBut Y is also? \n\nTo balance? \n\nPerhaps choose a word that uses M or P? \n\nFor instance: ""AMPLE"" E excluded? \n\n""MAPLE"" E? Excluded? \n\n""LAPEL"" L,A,P,E,L? E excluded? \n\n""RAPED"" E? \n\nOkay, difficult? \n\nAnother candidate: ""BADLY"" B,A,D,L,Y? Letters: B,D,L,Y? All available? And A? Yes? Distinct? Yes? \n\n""BADLY"" - adverb meaning poorly? Valid? Yes? Positions: B1, A2, D3, L4, Y5? \n\nSimilarly? \n\nCompared to ""BALKY""? \n\nBoth have L? ""BADLY"" has D instead of K? \n\nD is more common? \n\nAnother: ""DAILY"" I? excluded? \n\nNo? \n\n""FADED"" repeated D? Avoid? \n\nTherefore, I will choose ""BADLY"" because it uses common letters B, D, L, Y? And D is a new consonant? \n\nSo next guess: ""BADLY""\n\nBut confirm: \n- Positions: 1:B, 2:A, 3:D, 4:L, 5:Y? \n- Avoids excluded letters? C,R,N,E,W,I,S,T? Yes? \n- Includes A fixed in 2? Yes? \n\nSo <guess>badly</guess>? \n\nBut note: with feedback, this tests D in position 3, L in position 4, Y in position 5? \n\nAlternatively? \n\nAnother word? ""HARDY"" H,A,R,D,Y? R excluded? \n\n""LARDY"" L,A,R,D,Y? R excluded? \n\nSo ""BADLY"" seems solid? \n\nPerhaps ""PADDY"" double D? But with D? Let\'s see if repetition is worth? But less informative? \n\nSo I think ""BADLY"" is good? \n\nFinal choice: ""BADLY""\n\nTherefore, guessed word: badlyBased on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: A is in the word but not in position 3. C, R, N, E are not in the word.\n- **Guess 2 (""waist"")**: A is confirmed in position 2! W, I, S, T are not in the word.\n\n**Inferences**:\n- The secret word has **A in position 2**: pattern is `_ A _ _ _`.\n- Eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, W, I, S, T. Future guesses must avoid these.\n- Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.\n\n**Strategy for third guess**:\n- Keep **A in position 2**.\n- Choose a word with distinct, common unused letters to maximize information gain (e.g., focus on consonants like B, D, L, M).\n- Avoid eliminated letters and position 3 for A (already known wrong).\n\nStrong candidate: **BADLY** (B1, A2, D3, L4, Y5).  \n- Why?  \n  - Uses new common consonants (B, D, L) and tests Y.  \n  - Avoids repetition and uses high-frequency letters: D and L are among top English frequencies.  \n  - Valid word: adjective/adverb meaning ""in a poor or inadequate way"".  \n- Expected outcomes:  \n  - If B, D, L, or Y get `✓`, their positions are solved.  \n  - If `-`, letters are correct but misplaced.  \n  - If `x`, letters are eliminated, narrowing options further.\n\n<guess>badly</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: waist -> FEEDBACK: W(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: badly -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) D(x) L(x) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\n  - A is in the word but not in position 3.\n  - C, R, N, E are not in the word.\n\nGuess 2: ""waist"" -> W(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) T(x)\n  - A is correct and in position 2 (so the word has A as the second letter).\n  - W, I, S, T are not in the word.\n\nGuess 3: ""badly"" -> B(x) A(✓) D(x) L(x) Y(✓)\n  - A is still correct in position 2 (as expected).\n  - Y is correct and in position 5 (so the word ends with Y).\n  - B, D, L are not in the word.\n\nNow, combining all feedback:\n\n- The word has the pattern: _ A _ _ Y\n- A is in position 2, Y in position 5.\n- Eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, W, I, S, T, B, D, L\n- We know the word must have two more letters (positions 1 and 3) and one more letter in position 4? Actually, positions 1, 3, and 4? Wait, no: the word is 5 letters: position 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n  - Position 2: A (fixed)\n  - Position 5: Y (fixed)\n  - Positions 1, 3, and 4 are unknown.\n\nBut note: we have eliminated many letters. The remaining letters are from the set: F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Z.\n\nAlso, we must consider that the word has exactly 5 letters, and we know two of them (A and Y) and their positions.\n\nNow, we need to find a word that fits: [letter1] A [letter3] [letter4] Y\n\nWith letter1, letter3, letter4 from the remaining letters: F,G,H,J,K,M,O,P,Q,U,V,X,Z.\n\nMoreover, we have no information about letter4 yet? But in the pattern, it\'s the fourth letter.\n\nWe must also consider that the word might have repeated letters? But so far, we haven\'t seen any, but it\'s possible? However, we have eliminated many, so we can avoid repetition for now.\n\nNow, we need to make a guess that uses letters from the remaining set to test positions 1, 3, and 4.\n\nCommon letters remaining: G, H, K, M, O, P, U, V? (F, J, Q, X, Z are less common)\n\nWe should try to cover as many common letters as possible in one guess.\n\nPossible words that fit the pattern and use only available letters:\n\n- ""HAPPY"": but H is available? And P? But double P? Also, A is in 2, Y in 5? So H A P P Y? But we have two P\'s? And we don\'t know if P is in the word? But we can use it? However, repeated P? Not ideal for information? But if we get feedback, we can learn? But let\'s see.\n\nBut note: we have eliminated B, D, L? So ""HAPPY"" uses H, A, P, P, Y? But A and Y are fixed? So we are testing H in position 1 and P in positions 3 and 4? But repeated P? So if P is in the word, we might get partial feedback? But it\'s acceptable? However, we might get less information.\n\nBetter to avoid repetition? So let\'s try for distinct letters.\n\nWhat words? \n\n- ""GAMMY"": G A M M Y? Double M? Not distinct.\n\n- ""JAMMY"": J A M M Y? Double M? Also, J is less common.\n\n- ""MAYBE"": but E is eliminated? And B eliminated? \n\n- ""PAPPY"": double P? \n\n- ""HAPPY"" as above? \n\nBut let\'s think: \n\n- ""HAPPY"": H in 1, A in 2, P in 3, P in 4, Y in 5? \n\nBut we don\'t know if P is in the word? \n\nAlternatively, ""GASSY"": but S eliminated? \n\n""HAVOC"": H A V O C?

Double G? \n\n""KAPPA"": K A P P A? Double P and A? But A is already known? And we don\'t know if A is repeated? But in position 1? But we have A in 2? So if we put A in 1? But we know A is in 2? So if we put A in 1, it would be marked as (-) if present? But we know it\'s in 2? So putting A in 1 would be wrong? And we know it\'s not in 1? Because it\'s in 2? Actually, we don\'t know if there is another A? But from feedback, we only know one A? But it could be repeated? \n\nBut in ""badly"", we had A in 2 and it was ✓, and we didn\'t test other positions? So it\'s possible? \n\nBut to avoid complexity, let\'s assume no repetition for now? \n\nSo, words with distinct letters? \n\nPattern: [1] A [3] [4] Y\n\nAvailable letters: F,G,H,J,K,M,O,P,Q,U,V,X,Z\n\nTry to form a word? \n\n- ""HAPPY"" has repeated P? \n\n- ""GAMMY"" repeated M? \n\n- ""JUMBO"" but no Y? \n\n- ""HUMAN"" N eliminated? \n\n- ""GAYAL"" G A Y A L? But Y is in 5? And A in 2? So G A Y A L? That would be positions: 1:G, 2:A, 3:Y? But Y is fixed at 5? So conflict? \n\nWe need Y at 5? \n\nSo, ""GAYLY""? G A Y L Y? But Y at 3 and 5? And L? But L eliminated? \n\nNot? \n\n""JOKEY"": J O K E Y? E eliminated? \n\n""POKEY"": P O K E Y? E eliminated? \n\n""MAKEY""?

Not common? \n\n""WACKY"": W eliminated? \n\nSo, maybe we have to accept a word with repeated letters? \n\nAnother idea: ""HAPPY"" is a common word? \n\nBut let\'s see if there is a word without repetition? \n\n""GAZPY""? Not a word? \n\n""KAPOK"": K A P O K? But K repeated? \n\n""MAVIE""? Not? \n\n""PAVKY""? Not? \n\n""OAKUM"": O A K U M? But O in 1? A in 2? K in 3? U in 4? M in 5? But we need Y in 5? So not? \n\nWe need Y at 5? \n\nSo, the word must end with Y? \n\nTherefore, position 4 must be a letter that can come before Y? \n\nCommonly? \n\nFor example: ""HAPPY"" has P before Y? \n\n""FUNKY"": F U N K Y? N eliminated? \n\n""JUMPY"": J U M P Y? This is a word? Meaning nervous? Yes? \n\nLetters: J, U, M, P, Y? All available? And distinct? \n\nYes! J, U, M, P, Y? \n\nAnd pattern: J A? Wait, no: we have to put A in 2? \n\n""JUMPY"" is J U M P Y? But we need A in position 2? \n\nSo we cannot use ""JUMPY"" because it doesn\'t have A? \n\nWe must have A in position 2? \n\nSo the word is: [1] A [3] [4] Y\n\nSo we need a word that has A in second and Y in fifth? \n\n""JUMPY"" doesn\'t have A? \n\nSo not? \n\nAnother word: ""GIPSY"": G I P S Y?

And repeated P? \n\n- ""JAPAN"": J A P A N? But N eliminated? \n\n- ""KAPPA"": K A P P A? Double P and A? \n\n- ""PAPAY"": not a word? \n\n- ""QADDI"": not? \n\n- ""RABBY"": R eliminated? \n\n- ""SABBY"": S eliminated? \n\n- ""TABBY"": T eliminated? \n\n- ""HABIT"": H A B I T?

W eliminated? \n\n- ""YAHOO"": Y A H O O? But Y is at 1? But we need Y at 5? \n\nSo, after this, it seems ""HAPPY"" is a possible word? \n\nBut we have not eliminated H or P? \n\nAnother word: ""GAUPY""? Not a word? \n\n""JAUKY""? J A U K Y? This is a word? Meaning shy? Rare? \n\n""MAUZY""? Not? \n\n""PAUKY""? P A U K Y? Meaning cunning? Scottish? \n\nBut let\'s stick to common words? \n\n""HAZY"": only 4 letters? \n\n""HAYEY""? H A Y E Y? But E eliminated? And Y at 3? \n\nNot? \n\nSo, perhaps ""HAPPY"" is the most common? \n\nBut we have to consider that P might be repeated? \n\nAnother common word: ""GASSY"" but S eliminated? \n\n""NASTY"" N and S and T eliminated? \n\nSo, I think we have to go with ""HAPPY"" or similar? \n\nBut note: in ""HAPPY"", we are testing H in position 1 and P in positions 3 and 4? \n\nIf we guess ""HAPPY"", and if the word is ""HAPPY"", we win? \n\nBut if not, we get feedback on H and P? \n\nFor example, if H is not in the word, it will be x? And P? If P is in the word, we might get - or ✓ for the positions? \n\nBut since we have two P\'s, if one P is correct, we get one ✓ and one -? Or if both wrong, then x? \n\nBut it\'s acceptable? \n\nTo avoid repetition, is there a word with distinct letters? \n\nLet me try: ""JAMBU""? Not? \n\n""KAMIK"": K A M I K? I eliminated? \n\n""MAHOE"": M A H O E? E eliminated? \n\n""PAGLE""? Not? \n\n""QUAHAUG"": too long? \n\n""QUAKY"": Q U A K Y? But U in position 2? But we need A in 2? So ""Q U A K Y"" has U in 1, A in 2, K in 3, Y in 4? But we need 5 letters? ""QUAKY"" is 5: Q-U-A-K-Y? Positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:A, 4:K, 5:Y? But we need A in position 2? Here A is in position 3?

But Y in 3? And R eliminated? \n\nNot? \n\n""PUDGY"" P U D G Y? D eliminated? \n\nSo, ""HAPPY"" seems the best option? \n\nTherefore, fourth guess: ""HAPPY"" \n\nBut let\'s format: <guess>happy</guess> \n\nBut we have to be careful: if the word is not ""HAPPY"", we get feedback? \n\nFor example, if H is not in the word, and P is not, then we get all x except A and Y? \n\nBut then we have to try other letters? \n\nBut we have only 3 guesses left? \n\nWe have used 3, so this is the fourth? \n\nBut let\'s proceed? \n\nPerhaps there is a better word? \n\nAnother idea: ""JUMPY"" is not possible? \n\nOr ""GAMMY"" double M? \n\nBut ""GAMMY"" is a word? Meaning lame? \n\nG A M M Y? Pattern: G1, A2, M3, M4, Y5? \n\nBut repeated M? \n\nSimilarly, ""HAPPY"" has repeated P? \n\nBut both are similar? \n\nI think ""HAPPY"" is more common? \n\nSo I\'ll go with that.### Analysis of Previous Feedback\n\n- **Guess 1: ""crane""**  \n  - Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)  \n    - A is in the word but not in position 3.  \n    - C, R, N, E are eliminated (not in the word).  \n\n- **Guess 2: ""waist""**  \n  - Feedback: W(x), A(✓), I(x), S(x), T(x)  \n    - A is confirmed in position 2.  \n    - W, I, S, T are eliminated.  \n\n- **Guess 3: ""badly""**  \n  - Feedback: B(x), A(✓), D(x), L(x), Y(✓)  \n    - A is confirmed in position 2 (redundant but consistent).  \n    - Y is confirmed in position 5.  \n    - B, D, L are eliminated.  \n\n### Key Inferences\n- **Word pattern**: The secret word must be `_ A _ _ Y` (A in position 2, Y in position 5).  \n- **Eliminated letters (13 total)**: C, R, N, E, W, I, S, T, B, D, L.  \n- **Available letters (13 remaining)**: F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Z.  \n- **Constraints for next guess**:  \n  - Must include A in position 2 and Y in position 5.  \n  - Positions 1, 3, and 4 must use letters from the available set.  \n  - Avoid eliminated letters.  \n- **Strategy for Guess 4**:  \n  - Prioritize common letters from the available set (e.g., H, P, M, K, G) to maximize information.  \n  - Test multiple positions (1, 3, 4) simultaneously.  \n  - Given the limited options, repetition may be unavoidable, but distinct letters are preferred for better information gain.  \n  - After evaluating possible words (e.g., ""happy"", ""gamy"", ""jumpy""), ""happy"" is selected because:  \n    - It uses common letters (H, P).  \n    - It tests H in position 1 and P in positions 3 and 4 (repetition is necessary due to word constraints).  \n    - If ""happy"" is incorrect, feedback on H and P will significantly narrow possibilities (e.g., if P is correct, it reveals position; if not, P is eliminated).  \n    - It is a valid English word.  \n\n### Next Guess: ""happy""  \n- **Pattern**: H (position 1), A (position 2), P (position 3), P (position 4), Y (position 5).  \n- **Expected outcomes**:  \n  - If H is `✓`, position 1 is solved. If `x`, H is eliminated.  \n  - If P is `✓` in position 3 or 4, that position is solved. If `-`, P is in the word but misplaced.

We have feedback from five guesses:

  - Letters C, R, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""waist"" -> W(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) T(x)

  - Letters W, I, S, T are not in the word.

Guess 4: ""happy"" -> H(x) A(✓) P(x) P(x) Y(✓)
  - A and Y are still correct in positions 2 and 5.
  - Letters H and P are not in the word (both P instances marked x).

Guess 5: ""gaumy"" -> G(x) A(✓) U(x) M(x) Y(✓)
  - A and Y are correct in positions 2 and 5.
  - Letters G, U, M are not in the word.

We now know:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ A _ _ Y (with A in position 2 and Y in position 5).
- Eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, W, I, S, T, B, D, L, H, P, G, U, M. (all marked x in any of the guesses)
- Available letters: F, J, K, O, Q, V, X, Z. (since these have not been tried and not eliminated)

The word must be composed of letters only from the available set for positions 1, 3, and 4.

So, we need a 5-letter word of the form: [pos1: F,J,K,O,Q,V,X,Z] A [pos3: F,J,K,O,Q,V,X,Z] [pos4: F,J,K,O,Q,V,X,Z] Y

Possible words? We need to find an English word that fits.

Let's list possible candidates:

- ""JACKY"": But C is eliminated? C was eliminated in guess 1. Also, ""JACKY"" has C? So invalid.
- ""FJORD"": No A? And not ending with Y? Pattern must have A in position 2 and Y in position 5.
- ""KAZOO"": No A? And ends with O?
- ""OAKY"": Only 4 letters? We need 5-letter words.
- ""VODKA"": No Y? And A in position 4? But we need A in position 2.

We need something like: ? A ? ? Y

With [F,J,K,O,Q,V,X,Z] for positions 1,3,4.

Possible options:

- ""FAQIR"": F A Q I R? But I and R eliminated? Not available? I from guess 2 (eliminated), R from guess 1 (eliminated). So no.
- ""JAMMY"": J A M M Y? But M eliminated? From guess 5.
- ""JASPY"": J A S P Y? S and P eliminated? Not.
- ""KARMA"": K A R M A? R and M eliminated?
- ""OAKUM"": O A K U M? U and M eliminated?
- ""QUAKY"": Q U A K Y? But U eliminated? And A is in position 3? But we need A in position 2? Q U A K Y -> Q1, U2, A3, K4, Y5? So A is in position 3? But we know A must be in position 2? So not.

All these have issues.

Another idea: ""JAZZY""? J A Z Z Y? But Z is available? Letters: J, A, Z, Z, Y? So positions: J1, A2, Z3, Z4, Y5.

But is ""JAZZY"" a word? Yes, meaning resembling jazz or lively. Valid.

Check eliminated letters: J not eliminated? Z not eliminated? So yes? 

But we have repeated Z? But that's acceptable.

And it uses only available letters? Yes.

Similarly, ""FIZZY"": F I Z Z Y? But I eliminated? Not? 

""JAZZY"" seems a possible candidate.

Another word: ""VOZHD""? Not English? 

""QOPH"": Not 5 letters?

""KAYO"": Only 4?

""ZAX"": Not 5 letters.

So, ""JAZZY"" might be a candidate?

But let's see if there are others:

""OAVEN""? Not a word.

""VAGUY""? Not.

""JAKEY"": J A K E Y? E eliminated? Not.

""FOXTY""? Not a word? 

""JOLLY"": J O L L Y? L eliminated? 

""OZONE"": O Z O N E? O and Z? But N and E eliminated? And no A? 

We need A in position 2? 

So, ""JAZZY"" fits: J A Z Z Y? 

Similarly, ""FJORD"" doesn't have A? 

""QUICK"" no A? No Y? 

Another possibility: ""JIVEY""? J I V E Y? I and E eliminated? 

""VODKA"" no Y? 

So, ""JAZZY"" seems like a valid guess? 

But there might be others: 

""KAFFS"": Not? 

""ZOOKS"": No A? 

""JUKED"": J U K E D? E,U,D eliminated? 

So, I think ""JAZZY"" is the best bet? 

But let's confirm the pattern? 

If ""JAZZY"" is the word, positions: J1, A2, Z3, Z4, Y5? 

We have Z repeated? 

Feedback would have? 

But in our constraints, letters J and Z are available? 

So next guess: ""JAZZY""

But we have only one guess left? 

We have used 5, so this is the sixth? 

We have 6 tries? 

So final guess? 

Therefore, we guess ""JAZZY""

<guess>jazzy</guess> 

If this is not correct, we lose? 

But let's see if there is any other word? 

Another word: ""FIZZY"" has I eliminated? 

""JACKY"" has C eliminated? 

""BAZOO"" B eliminated? 

So, ""JAZZY"" seems to be the only common possibility? 

Therefore, we go with that.
</think>
Based on the cumulative feedback from all previous guesses:

### Key Inferences
1. **Confirmed positions**:
   - Position 2: `A` (from Guess 2, 3, 4, 5 feedback: `✓`).
   - Position 5: `Y` (from Guess 3, 4, 5 feedback: `✓`).
   - Thus, the word pattern is: `_ A _ _ Y`.

2. **Eliminated letters (15 total)**:
   - `C, R, N, E` (Guess 1: all `x`).
   - `W, I, S, T` (Guess 2: all `x`).
   - `B, D, L` (Guess 3: all `x`).
   - `H, P` (Guess 4: `H(x)`, `P(x)`).
   - `G, U, M` (Guess 5: all `x`).
  
   These letters **cannot appear** in the word.

3. **Available letters for positions 1, 3, and 4 (8 remaining)**:
   - `F, J, K, O, Q, V, X, Z`.

4. **Constraints**:
   - The word must end with `Y`, have `A` in position 2, and use only available letters for the unknown positions (1, 3, 4).
   - After testing common options (e.g., ""gummy"" – eliminated M; ""fizzy"" – eliminated I; ""jacky"" – eliminated C), only ""jazzy"" fits:
     - `J` (position 1), `A` (position 2), `Z` (position 3), `Z` (position 4), `Y` (position 5).
     - Uses distinct available letters `J` and `Z`.
     - Valid English word (meaning ""lively or bright"").

### Next Guess: ""jazzy""
- Will either win the game or provide decisive feedback (e.g., if incorrect, letters `J` and `Z` are eliminated).

<guess>jazzy</guess>",jazzy,"We have feedback from five guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
  - A is in the word but not in position 3.
  - Letters C, R, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""waist"" -> W(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) T(x)
  - A is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
  - Letters W, I, S, T are not in the word.

Guess 3: ""badly"" -> B(x) A(✓) D(x) L(x) Y(✓)
  - A is still in position 2 (correct).
  - Y is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).
  - Letters B, D, L are not in the word.

Guess 4: ""happy"" -> H(x) A(✓) P(x) P(x) Y(✓)
  - A and Y are still correct in positions 2 and 5.
  - Letters H and P are not in the word (both P instances marked x).

Guess 5: ""gaumy"" -> G(x) A(✓) U(x) M(x) Y(✓)
  - A and Y are correct in positions 2 and 5.
  - Letters G, U, M are not in the word.

We now know:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ A _ _ Y (with A in position 2 and Y in position 5).
- Eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, W, I, S, T, B, D, L, H, P, G, U, M. (all marked x in any of the guesses)
- Available letters: F, J, K, O, Q, V, X, Z. (since these have not been tried and not eliminated)

The word must be composed of letters only from the available set for positions 1, 3, and 4.

So, we need a 5-letter word of the form: [pos1: F,J,K,O,Q,V,X,Z] A [pos3: F,J,K,O,Q,V,X,Z] [pos4: F,J,K,O,Q,V,X,Z] Y

- ""FJORD"": No A? And not ending with Y? Pattern must have A in position 2 and Y in position 5.
- ""KAZOO"": No A? And ends with O?
- ""OAKY"": Only 4 letters? We need 5-letter words.
- ""VODKA"": No Y? And A in position 4? But we need A in position 2.

We need something like: ? A ? ? Y

With [F,J,K,O,Q,V,X,Z] for positions 1,3,4.

Possible options:

- ""FAQIR"": F A Q I R? But I and R eliminated? Not available? I from guess 2 (eliminated), R from guess 1 (eliminated). So no.
- ""JAMMY"": J A M M Y? But M eliminated? From guess 5.
- ""JASPY"": J A S P Y? S and P eliminated? Not.
- ""KARMA"": K A R M A? R and M eliminated?
- ""OAKUM"": O A K U M? U and M eliminated?
- ""QUAKY"": Q U A K Y? But U eliminated? And A is in position 3? But we need A in position 2? Q U A K Y -> Q1, U2, A3, K4, Y5? So A is in position 3? But we know A must be in position 2? So not.

All these have issues.

Another idea: ""JAZZY""? J A Z Z Y? But Z is available? Letters: J, A, Z, Z, Y? So positions: J1, A2, Z3, Z4, Y5.

But is ""JAZZY"" a word? Yes, meaning resembling jazz or lively. Valid.

Check eliminated letters: J not eliminated? Z not eliminated? So yes? 

But we have repeated Z? But that's acceptable.

And it uses only available letters? Yes.

Similarly, ""FIZZY"": F I Z Z Y? But I eliminated? Not? 

""JAZZY"" seems a possible candidate.

Another word: ""VOZHD""? Not English? 

""QOPH"": Not 5 letters?

""KAYO"": Only 4?

""ZAX"": Not 5 letters.

So, ""JAZZY"" might be a candidate?

But let's see if there are others:

""OAVEN""? Not a word.

""VAGUY""? Not.

""JAKEY"": J A K E Y? E eliminated? Not.

""FOXTY""? Not a word? 

""JOLLY"": J O L L Y? L eliminated? 

""OZONE"": O Z O N E? O and Z? But N and E eliminated? And no A? 

We need A in position 2? 

So, ""JAZZY"" fits: J A Z Z Y? 

Similarly, ""FJORD"" doesn't have A? 

""QUICK"" no A? No Y? 

Another possibility: ""JIVEY""? J I V E Y? I and E eliminated? 

""VODKA"" no Y? 

So, ""JAZZY"" seems like a valid guess? 

But there might be others: 

""KAFFS"": Not? 

""ZOOKS"": No A? 

""JUKED"": J U K E D? E,U,D eliminated? 

So, I think ""JAZZY"" is the best bet? 

But let's confirm the pattern? 

If ""JAZZY"" is the word, positions: J1, A2, Z3, Z4, Y5? 

We have Z repeated? 

Feedback would have? 

But in our constraints, letters J and Z are available? 

So next guess: ""JAZZY""

But we have only one guess left? 

We have used 5, so this is the sixth? 

We have 6 tries? 

So final guess? 

Therefore, we guess ""JAZZY""

<guess>jazzy</guess> 

If this is not correct, we lose? 

But let's see if there is any other word? 

Another word: ""FIZZY"" has I eliminated? 

""JACKY"" has C eliminated? 

""BAZOO"" B eliminated? 

So, ""JAZZY"" seems to be the only common possibility? 

Therefore, we go with that.Based on the cumulative feedback from all previous guesses:

### Key Inferences
1. **Confirmed positions**:
   - Position 2: `A` (from Guess 2, 3, 4, 5 feedback: `✓`).
   - Position 5: `Y` (from Guess 3, 4, 5 feedback: `✓`).
   - Thus, the word pattern is: `_ A _ _ Y`.

2. **Eliminated letters (15 total)**:
   - `C, R, N, E` (Guess 1: all `x`).
   - `W, I, S, T` (Guess 2: all `x`).
   - `B, D, L` (Guess 3: all `x`).
   - `H, P` (Guess 4: `H(x)`, `P(x)`).
   - `G, U, M` (Guess 5: all `x`).
  
   These letters **cannot appear** in the word.

3. **Available letters for positions 1, 3, and 4 (8 remaining)**:
   - `F, J, K, O, Q, V, X, Z`.

4. **Constraints**:
   - The word must end with `Y`, have `A` in position 2, and use only available letters for the unknown positions (1, 3, 4).
   - After testing common options (e.g., ""gummy"" – eliminated M; ""fizzy"" – eliminated I; ""jacky"" – eliminated C), only ""jazzy"" fits:
     - `J` (position 1), `A` (position 2), `Z` (position 3), `Z` (position 4), `Y` (position 5).
     - Uses distinct available letters `J` and `Z`.
     - Valid English word (meaning ""lively or bright"").

### Next Guess: ""jazzy""
- Will either win the game or provide decisive feedback (e.g., if incorrect, letters `J` and `Z` are eliminated).",Guess 6: jazzy -> FEEDBACK: J(✓) A(✓) Z(✓) Z(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
