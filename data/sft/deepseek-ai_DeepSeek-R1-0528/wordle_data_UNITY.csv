Alright, the user is starting a new wordle game and needs a first guess. Let me think about what makes a good opening word.

The most important factors are covering common letters and maximizing positional coverage. Based on word frequency analysis, letters like E, A, R, O appear most often in English words. For positioning, vowels tend to cluster in specific spots while consonants vary.

""Salet"" comes to mind from strategy guides - it covers S/A/L/E/T. S and T are common starters/enders, A/E are frequent vowels. But not ideal since L isn't as common. Alternative is ""Tares"" which hits T/A/R/E/S - all top-tier letters. 

Hmm... actually ""Audio"" gives A/U/D/I/O - four vowels to quickly identify vowel patterns. But misses common consonants. Best compromise might be ""Crane"" - C/R/A/N/E. Covers three vowels (A,E) and three common consonants (C,R,N) while avoiding repeats.

Wait, no - ""Crane"" uses C which is reasonably common. The R and N give solid positional coverage too. Or ""Slate""? S/L/A/T/E - S and T are excellent edge letters. Perhaps between Crane/Slate...

*checks letter distribution charts*
Actually ""Soare"" was historically popular - S/O/A/R/E. Oh! That's better - includes the vital S starting letter which is statistically advantageous. But O/A/R/E are all top-10 frequency letters.

However since the user didn't specify any constraints, the safest is confirmed by multiple sources: ""CRATE"". Why? 
- C: frequent first letter 
- R: common in positions 2/3
- A: most used vowel across all positions 
- T/E: extremely common ending letters

Plus no duplicates. So CRATE gets maximum coverage. Final decision.
</think>
For the first guess, I want to prioritize maximizing information gain by using a word with high-frequency letters and good positional coverage. Optimal starters typically include common letters like E, A, R, O, and S to cover frequent vowels and consonants. The word ""CRATE"" is an excellent choice because:
- It includes **C**, **R**, **A**, **T**, and **E**—all among the top 15 most common English letters.
- Contains **three vowels (A, E)** and **two consonants (C, R, T)** for balanced coverage.
- Avoids duplicate letters.
- Tests **A** (position 3) and **E** (position 5), common vowel placements.
- Strategically anchors **C** (position 1, relatively common) and **T** (position 4, frequent).

This guess will efficiently narrow down possibilities using feedback on letter presence/position.

Okay, the first guess was ""crate"" and the feedback was C(x), R(x), A(x), T(✓), E(x). Only T was correct and in the right position—specifically, T is the fourth letter. So the secret word has T in position 4. The letters C, R, A, and E are not in the word at all. 

I need to exclude C, R, A, E entirely. Since T is fixed at position 4, the word pattern looks like _ _ _ T _. 

For the next guess, I should:
- Avoid using C, R, A, E.
- Include other common letters to test more possibilities.
- Focus on vowels since A and E are out—so test O, I, U, along with frequent consonants like S, N, L, etc.
- Prioritize vowel-rich words because A/E are eliminated.

Good candidate words:
- Must have T at position 4.
- Should contain new high-frequency letters: S, O, I, N, L, D, etc.
- Avoid wasting positions on eliminated letters.

Possible words: 
- Ending patterns: ...T?—common endings like T+H (e.g., ""growth""), T+Y (""party""), T+S (""gifts""), but need full words.

Brainstorming:
- ""Point""? P-O-I-N-T → position 4 is N, not T—wrong spot.
- Words with T fixed at position 4: fifth character must be different.

Example stock words:
- ""LIGHT"": L-I-G-H-T → T is position 5, not 4. Not suitable.
- Explicitly: pattern _ _ _ T _.

Common words fitting:
- ""MINTY""? But M-I-N-T-Y → T is position 4? Positions: 1:M, 2:I, 3:N, 4:T, 5:Y → yes! But contains I and Y—both common vowels/consonants.

Other options:
- ""DUTCH""? D-U-T-C-H → contains C (eliminated), invalid.
- ""BIGHT""? B-I-G-H-T → T position 5.

Perhaps ""PITHY"": P-I-T-H-Y → T is position 3, not 4. Wrong.

I need to list words ending with T at position 4. Essentially, words like XX?TX.

Looking for real English words:
- ...ITH? Like ""SMITH"", ""WITHH"" is not a word. ""SMITH"": S-M-I-T-H → T is position 4? Position:1:S,2:M,3:I,4:T,5:H → yes! 

But ""SMITH"" has S,M,I,T,H. S is high-frequency, I is common vowel, M and H are worth testing.

Similarly: ""PATIO"" — but P-A-T-I-O → T is position 3, not 4.

Must strictly adhere to _ _ _ T _.

Better examples:
- ""LATIN"": L-A-T-I-N → but A is eliminated! Cannot use A.
- ""FOCUS"" : F-O-C-U-S → C is eliminated, no T.
- Stay away from used letters.

Another word: ""POUTS"" → P-O-U-T-S → T position 4? 3 is U, 4 is T, 5: S → yes! Letters P,O,U,T,S. 

Advantages:
- P,O,U are new vowels; S common consonant.
- Avoids C,R,A,E.

""MOIST"" → M-O-I-S-T → T position 5, not 4.

Perhaps ""HUTCH"" → contains C eliminated, invalid.

Re-evaluating:
- Ideal: Use S,O,I,N,L,D,G,H,U,Y.
- Word with T fixed: so pattern prefix + T + suffix.

Let's systematize:
- Position 4: T
- Positions 1,2,3,5: avoid C,R,A,E.

Possible words:
- ""LIGHT"" → no, position 5 is T.
- Try 5-letter words with 4th letter T: e.g., BATTY? But A eliminated. Cannot.
- Valid: ""MINTY"" — M-I-N-T-Y. Contains N (good), I,Y (vowels/cons), no banned letters. Pattern positions:1:M,2:I,3:N,4:T,5:Y.

Another: ""PITHY"" — P-I-T-H-Y → T is position 3.
""PARTY"" — contains A eliminated.

""SENTY"" not common.""DITTY"" contains doubled T? Not efficient.

Perhaps ""SOUTH"": S-O-U-T-H → T position 4? Pos:1:S,2:O,3:U,4:T,5:H → yes! S,O,U,T,H. All valid letters.

""LOUTH"" not common.""DOUBT"" → but B? Positions: D-O-U-B-T → T at 5, not 4.

Confirmed words:
- ""SOUTH"": valid pattern _ _ _ T _ with S,O,U,T,H.
- ""SMITH"": S,M,I,T,H.
- ""FIGHT""? Position 5 T—bad.

I like ""SOUTH"" because:
- Tests O,U,H,S — all useful.
- S is beginning-friendly.
- Avoids repetition.

Alternative: ""POUTS"" same as SOUTH but S ending—common ending letter.

But SOUTH may be slightly better? To be efficient.

Since T is confirmed, and only T is found—no other letters known—maximizing new letters is key.

Letters not yet tested:
Most frequent remaining: O,I,L,S,N, etc.

SOUTH covers S,O,U,T,H.

Another candidate: ""NOISY"" — but T not fixed? Pattern N-O-I-S-Y → no T unless placed.

But T must be at position 4—so guess must include T there.

Therefore, ""SOUTH"" or ""SMITH"" or ""MINTY""?

Comparing:
- SOUTH: S,O,U,H → U less common but valuable if present.
- SMITH: S,M,I,H → tests M,I,H.
- MINTY: M,I,N,T,Y → tests M,I,N,Y.

All seem reasonable but SMITH tests I which is key vowel, and S/M/I/H—all common letters in useful positions.

SOUTH may be weaker because U is rarer, H is common ender but here in middle? SOUTH is valid word.

Prefer to test O/I since vowels are critical to identify early.

Therefore ""POUTS"": P-O-U-T-S → same as SOUTH but P instead of H? Positions 1:P,2:O,3:U,4:T,5:S. Tests P,O,U,S—and S at end. H vs P? P less common than H.

Statistically, after T fixed, most helpful is to probe other vowels and frequent consonants.

Perhaps ""TOILS""? But T position 1—not necessary, and contains O,I,L,S—but T at start may conflict? We don't know.

Stick to pattern: _ _ _ T _

Better choice: ""PILOT"" → P-I-L-O-T → T at position 5—invalid.

Keep hunting.

Another: ""LITHE"" → L-I-T-H-E → T at position 3—wrong.

Use word list imagination:
- ""NIGHT"" → T pos 5.
- ""TIGHT"" → T pos 1.
- Must be ???T?.

""WIDTH"" → W-I-D-T-H → positions? 1:W,2:I,3:D,4:T,5:H → yes! Letters W,I,D,T,H. Avoids bad letters but W/D/I—I is vowel.

Similarly ""DITCH"" contains C eliminated.

Best options:
1. SOUTH: S,O,U,T,H
2. SMITH: S,M,I,T,H
3. MINTY: M,I,N,T,Y
4. WIDTH: W,I,D,T,H

MINTY is less common but valid. SMITH is very common.

SMITH scores better because S is highly likely at position 1 or elsewhere, and I tests vowel.

U in SOUTH is riskier since less frequent.

So ""SMITH""—S position 1 to test common starter, M consonant, I vowel, H ending possibility.

Thus SMITH seems optimal.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess (""crate""):
- **C, R, A, E** are **NOT** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **T** is in the word and in the **CORRECT position (position 4)**. So the secret word has the pattern: `_ _ _ T _`.

### Strategy for the second guess:
1. **Must include T in position 4** to confirm or build on the known position.
2. **Avoid C, R, A, E** entirely since they are eliminated.
3. **Test new high-frequency letters** to maximize information gain. Prioritize common vowels (like **O, I, U**) and consonants (like **S, N, L, D**) not yet tested.
4. Choose a word with **no duplicate letters** to cover more ground.
5. Ensure the guess is a **valid 5-letter English word**.

**Chosen word: ""SMITH""**  
- **Why?**  
  - Fits the pattern `_ _ _ T _` (position 4 is T).  
  - Tests new common letters: **S** (high-frequency starter), **M**, **I** (crucial vowel), **H** (common consonant/ender).  
  - Avoids eliminated letters (C, R, A, E).  
  - Balances vowel and consonant coverage—only **I** is a vowel in this guess, but it's a key vowel to test.  
- Alternatives (like ""SOUTH"" or ""MINTY"") were considered, but ""SMITH"" is stronger due to testing **S** in position 1 (statistically advantageous) and **I** (common vowel).

SOUTH covers S,O,U,T,H.

Another candidate: ""NOISY"" — but T not fixed? Pattern N-O-I-S-Y → no T unless placed.

But T must be at position 4—so guess must include T there.

Therefore, ""SOUTH"" or ""SMITH"" or ""MINTY""?

Comparing:
- SOUTH: S,O,U,H → U less common but valuable if present.
- SMITH: S,M,I,H → tests M,I,H.
- MINTY: M,I,N,T,Y → tests M,I,N,Y.

All seem reasonable but SMITH tests I which is key vowel, and S/M/I/H—all common letters in useful positions.

SOUTH may be weaker because U is rarer, H is common ender but here in middle? SOUTH is valid word.

Prefer to test O/I since vowels are critical to identify early.

Therefore ""POUTS"": P-O-U-T-S → same as SOUTH but P instead of H? Positions 1:P,2:O,3:U,4:T,5:S. Tests P,O,U,S—and S at end. H vs P? P less common than H.

Statistically, after T fixed, most helpful is to probe other vowels and frequent consonants.

Perhaps ""TOILS""? But T position 1—not necessary, and contains O,I,L,S—but T at start may conflict? We don't know.

Stick to pattern: _ _ _ T _

Better choice: ""PILOT"" → P-I-L-O-T → T at position 5—invalid.

Keep hunting.

Another: ""LITHE"" → L-I-T-H-E → T at position 3—wrong.

Use word list imagination:
- ""NIGHT"" → T pos 5.
- ""TIGHT"" → T pos 1.
- Must be ???T?.

""WIDTH"" → W-I-D-T-H → positions? 1:W,2:I,3:D,4:T,5:H → yes! Letters W,I,D,T,H. Avoids bad letters but W/D/I—I is vowel.

Similarly ""DITCH"" contains C eliminated.

Best options:
1. SOUTH: S,O,U,T,H
2. SMITH: S,M,I,T,H
3. MINTY: M,I,N,T,Y
4. WIDTH: W,I,D,T,H

MINTY is less common but valid. SMITH is very common.

SMITH scores better because S is highly likely at position 1 or elsewhere, and I tests vowel.

U in SOUTH is riskier since less frequent.

So ""SMITH""—S position 1 to test common starter, M consonant, I vowel, H ending possibility.

Thus SMITH seems optimal.Based on the feedback from the first guess (""crate""):
- **C, R, A, E** are **NOT** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **T** is in the word and in the **CORRECT position (position 4)**. So the secret word has the pattern: `_ _ _ T _`.

### Strategy for the second guess:
1. **Must include T in position 4** to confirm or build on the known position.
2. **Avoid C, R, A, E** entirely since they are eliminated.
3. **Test new high-frequency letters** to maximize information gain. Prioritize common vowels (like **O, I, U**) and consonants (like **S, N, L, D**) not yet tested.
4. Choose a word with **no duplicate letters** to cover more ground.
5. Ensure the guess is a **valid 5-letter English word**.

**Chosen word: ""SMITH""**  
- **Why?**  
  - Fits the pattern `_ _ _ T _` (position 4 is T).  
  - Tests new common letters: **S** (high-frequency starter), **M**, **I** (crucial vowel), **H** (common consonant/ender).  
  - Avoids eliminated letters (C, R, A, E).  
  - Balances vowel and consonant coverage—only **I** is a vowel in this guess, but it's a key vowel to test.  
- Alternatives (like ""SOUTH"" or ""MINTY"") were considered, but ""SMITH"" is stronger due to testing **S** in position 1 (statistically advantageous) and **I** (common vowel).",Guess 2: smith -> FEEDBACK: S(x) M(x) I(✓) T(✓) H(x),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>Alright, the user is starting a new wordle game and needs a first guess. Let me think about what makes a good opening word.

The most important factors are covering common letters and maximizing positional coverage. Based on word frequency analysis, letters like E, A, R, O appear most often in English words. For positioning, vowels tend to cluster in specific spots while consonants vary.

""Salet"" comes to mind from strategy guides - it covers S/A/L/E/T. S and T are common starters/enders, A/E are frequent vowels. But not ideal since L isn't as common. Alternative is ""Tares"" which hits T/A/R/E/S - all top-tier letters. 

Hmm... actually ""Audio"" gives A/U/D/I/O - four vowels to quickly identify vowel patterns. But misses common consonants. Best compromise might be ""Crane"" - C/R/A/N/E. Covers three vowels (A,E) and three common consonants (C,R,N) while avoiding repeats.

Wait, no - ""Crane"" uses C which is reasonably common. The R and N give solid positional coverage too. Or ""Slate""? S/L/A/T/E - S and T are excellent edge letters. Perhaps between Crane/Slate...

*checks letter distribution charts*
Actually ""Soare"" was historically popular - S/O/A/R/E. Oh! That's better - includes the vital S starting letter which is statistically advantageous. But O/A/R/E are all top-10 frequency letters.

However since the user didn't specify any constraints, the safest is confirmed by multiple sources: ""CRATE"". Why? 
- C: frequent first letter 
- R: common in positions 2/3
- A: most used vowel across all positions 
- T/E: extremely common ending letters

Plus no duplicates. So CRATE gets maximum coverage. Final decision.For the first guess, I want to prioritize maximizing information gain by using a word with high-frequency letters and good positional coverage. Optimal starters typically include common letters like E, A, R, O, and S to cover frequent vowels and consonants. The word ""CRATE"" is an excellent choice because:
- It includes **C**, **R**, **A**, **T**, and **E**—all among the top 15 most common English letters.
- Contains **three vowels (A, E)** and **two consonants (C, R, T)** for balanced coverage.
- Avoids duplicate letters.
- Tests **A** (position 3) and **E** (position 5), common vowel placements.
- Strategically anchors **C** (position 1, relatively common) and **T** (position 4, frequent).

This guess will efficiently narrow down possibilities using feedback on letter presence/position.

<guess>crate</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crate -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>Okay, the first guess was ""crate"" and the feedback was C(x), R(x), A(x), T(✓), E(x). Only T was correct and in the right position—specifically, T is the fourth letter. So the secret word has T in position 4. The letters C, R, A, and E are not in the word at all. 

I need to exclude C, R, A, E entirely. Since T is fixed at position 4, the word pattern looks like _ _ _ T _. 

For the next guess, I should:
- Avoid using C, R, A, E.
- Include other common letters to test more possibilities.
- Focus on vowels since A and E are out—so test O, I, U, along with frequent consonants like S, N, L, etc.
- Prioritize vowel-rich words because A/E are eliminated.

Good candidate words:
- Must have T at position 4.
- Should contain new high-frequency letters: S, O, I, N, L, D, etc.
- Avoid wasting positions on eliminated letters.

Possible words: 
- Ending patterns: ...T?—common endings like T+H (e.g., ""growth""), T+Y (""party""), T+S (""gifts""), but need full words.

Brainstorming:
- ""Point""? P-O-I-N-T → position 4 is N, not T—wrong spot.
- Words with T fixed at position 4: fifth character must be different.

Example stock words:
- ""LIGHT"": L-I-G-H-T → T is position 5, not 4. Not suitable.
- Explicitly: pattern _ _ _ T _.

Common words fitting:
- ""MINTY""? But M-I-N-T-Y → T is position 4? Positions: 1:M, 2:I, 3:N, 4:T, 5:Y → yes! But contains I and Y—both common vowels/consonants.

Other options:
- ""DUTCH""? D-U-T-C-H → contains C (eliminated), invalid.
- ""BIGHT""? B-I-G-H-T → T position 5.

Perhaps ""PITHY"": P-I-T-H-Y → T is position 3, not 4. Wrong.

I need to list words ending with T at position 4. Essentially, words like XX?TX.

Looking for real English words:
- ...ITH? Like ""SMITH"", ""WITHH"" is not a word. ""SMITH"": S-M-I-T-H → T is position 4? Position:1:S,2:M,3:I,4:T,5:H → yes! 

But ""SMITH"" has S,M,I,T,H. S is high-frequency, I is common vowel, M and H are worth testing.

Similarly: ""PATIO"" — but P-A-T-I-O → T is position 3, not 4.

Must strictly adhere to _ _ _ T _.

Better examples:
- ""LATIN"": L-A-T-I-N → but A is eliminated! Cannot use A.
- ""FOCUS"" : F-O-C-U-S → C is eliminated, no T.
- Stay away from used letters.

Another word: ""POUTS"" → P-O-U-T-S → T position 4? 3 is U, 4 is T, 5: S → yes! Letters P,O,U,T,S. 

Advantages:
- P,O,U are new vowels; S common consonant.
- Avoids C,R,A,E.

""MOIST"" → M-O-I-S-T → T position 5, not 4.

Perhaps ""HUTCH"" → contains C eliminated, invalid.

Re-evaluating:
- Ideal: Use S,O,I,N,L,D,G,H,U,Y.
- Word with T fixed: so pattern prefix + T + suffix.

Let's systematize:
- Position 4: T
- Positions 1,2,3,5: avoid C,R,A,E.

Possible words:
- ""LIGHT"" → no, position 5 is T.
- Try 5-letter words with 4th letter T: e.g., BATTY? But A eliminated. Cannot.
- Valid: ""MINTY"" — M-I-N-T-Y. Contains N (good), I,Y (vowels/cons), no banned letters. Pattern positions:1:M,2:I,3:N,4:T,5:Y.

Another: ""PITHY"" — P-I-T-H-Y → T is position 3.
""PARTY"" — contains A eliminated.

""SENTY"" not common.""DITTY"" contains doubled T? Not efficient.

Perhaps ""SOUTH"": S-O-U-T-H → T position 4? Pos:1:S,2:O,3:U,4:T,5:H → yes! S,O,U,T,H. All valid letters.

""LOUTH"" not common.""DOUBT"" → but B? Positions: D-O-U-B-T → T at 5, not 4.

Confirmed words:
- ""SOUTH"": valid pattern _ _ _ T _ with S,O,U,T,H.
- ""SMITH"": S,M,I,T,H.
- ""FIGHT""? Position 5 T—bad.

I like ""SOUTH"" because:
- Tests O,U,H,S — all useful.
- S is beginning-friendly.
- Avoids repetition.

Alternative: ""POUTS"" same as SOUTH but S ending—common ending letter.

But SOUTH may be slightly better? To be efficient.

Since T is confirmed, and only T is found—no other letters known—maximizing new letters is key.

Letters not yet tested:
Most frequent remaining: O,I,L,S,N, etc.

SOUTH covers S,O,U,T,H.

Another candidate: ""NOISY"" — but T not fixed? Pattern N-O-I-S-Y → no T unless placed.

But T must be at position 4—so guess must include T there.

Therefore, ""SOUTH"" or ""SMITH"" or ""MINTY""?

Comparing:
- SOUTH: S,O,U,H → U less common but valuable if present.
- SMITH: S,M,I,H → tests M,I,H.
- MINTY: M,I,N,T,Y → tests M,I,N,Y.

All seem reasonable but SMITH tests I which is key vowel, and S/M/I/H—all common letters in useful positions.

SOUTH may be weaker because U is rarer, H is common ender but here in middle? SOUTH is valid word.

Use word list imagination:
- ""NIGHT"" → T pos 5.
- ""TIGHT"" → T pos 1.
- Must be ???T?.

""WIDTH"" → W-I-D-T-H → positions? 1:W,2:I,3:D,4:T,5:H → yes! Letters W,I,D,T,H. Avoids bad letters but W/D/I—I is vowel.

Similarly ""DITCH"" contains C eliminated.

Best options:
1. SOUTH: S,O,U,T,H
2. SMITH: S,M,I,T,H
3. MINTY: M,I,N,T,Y
4. WIDTH: W,I,D,T,H

MINTY is less common but valid. SMITH is very common.

SMITH scores better because S is highly likely at position 1 or elsewhere, and I tests vowel.

U in SOUTH is riskier since less frequent.

We are given feedback from two previous guesses:

Guess 1: ""crate"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), T(✓), E(x)
This means:
- T is correct and in the correct position (position 4).
- C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: ""smith"" -> S(x), M(x), I(✓), T(✓), H(x)
This means:
- I is correct and in the correct position (position 3? because in ""smith"", I is the third letter).
- T is again confirmed correct and in position 4 (which we already knew).
- S, M, H are not in the word.

Note: The positions matter. In ""smith"":
  Position 1: S -> absent (x)
  Position 2: M -> absent (x)
  Position 3: I -> correct (✓)
  Position 4: T -> correct (✓)
  Position 5: H -> absent (x)

So from the feedback, we know:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ _ I T _ 
  (because I is in position 3 and T in position 4).

Additionally, the following letters are absent: C, R, A, E, S, M, H.

We have used 8 distinct letters: C, R, A, T, E, S, M, I, H. But note T and I are present, so we must avoid the absent ones.

We need to make a new 5-letter word that:
- Has the pattern: _ _ I T _
- Does not contain any of the absent letters: C, R, A, E, S, M, H.
- Must be a valid English word.

We also know that the first two letters must be letters that we haven't tried yet (or that are not in the absent list) and the last letter must be a letter not in the absent list.

We can think of common letters that are still available. The most common letters in English that we haven't tried include: O, U, L, N, D, P, B, G, Y, etc.

We need to form a word that fits _ _ I T _

Let's list some words that fit the pattern and avoid the absent letters:

Possible words:
- The word must end with ""IT"" in the third and fourth positions, so the last part is ""IT"" and then one more letter at the end.

Examples:
- ...IT? -> the last letter can be various.

Common words:
- ""LIGHT"": but H is absent -> invalid.
- ""TIGHT"": T at the start? But we have T at position 4, and we don't know about the first letter. However, note that T is already in the word (at position 4) and we don't know if it can appear again? The rules don't say the word cannot have duplicate letters, but in this case, we don't have any duplicate so far. Also, ""TIGHT"" has two T's? Actually, ""TIGHT"" is T-I-G-H-T -> positions: T at 1 and 5, and we have I at 2? But our pattern requires I at position 3 and T at 4. So ""TIGHT"" doesn't fit the pattern.

We need the pattern: letter1, letter2, I, T, letter5.

So the word is: [letter1][letter2] I T [letter5]

We must avoid: C, R, A, E, S, M, H.

Let's try to think of words that end with ""IT"" and then one letter? Actually, the ""IT"" is in the middle, so the word is XXITX.

Some possibilities:
- ""UNITE"": U-N-I-T-E -> but E is absent (from first guess) -> invalid.
- ""UNITY"": U-N-I-T-Y -> letters: U, N, I, T, Y. 
  - Check absent: U, N, Y are not in the absent list. I and T are present. So valid.
- ""POINT"": P-O-I-N-T -> pattern: P-O-I-N-T -> positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:I, 4:T? Wait, no: the fourth letter is N, and fifth is T. So the T is at position 5, not 4. Doesn't fit pattern (we need T at position 4).
- ""JOINT"": same issue, T at the end.
- ""FLINT"": F-L-I-N-T -> again, T at the end (position 5) and N at position 4 -> doesn't fit.
- ""BUILT"": B-U-I-L-T -> pattern: B-U-I-L-T -> positions: 1:B, 2:U, 3:I, 4:L, 5:T -> but we need position 4 to be T, but here it's L. So no.
- ""QUIT"": only 4 letters -> too short.
- ""QUIET"": Q-U-I-E-T -> but E is absent -> invalid.
- ""QUITE"": Q-U-I-T-E -> E is absent -> invalid.
- ""SUITE"": S and E absent -> invalid.
- ""WAIST"": W-A-I-S-T -> A and S are absent -> invalid.
- ""EXIST"": E and S absent -> invalid.
- ""TOWIT"": not common, and T at start? Also, we have T at position 4, but if we use T at start, that's allowed? But we don't know if T can be duplicated. However, we haven't been told that T is duplicated, so we should avoid duplicates unless necessary? But the rules don't forbid duplicates. However, in the feedback for ""smith"", we had T at position 4 and we don't have any indication of another T. But we can't assume. However, to be safe, we might avoid T in other positions until we have evidence of duplicates.

But note: the feedback for ""crate"" had T as correct at position 4, and then in ""smith"" we again had T at position 4 as correct. That doesn't tell us about other T's. So we cannot rule out having another T.

But in the pattern, we are only required to have T at position 4. The other positions can be any letter (including T) unless we have a reason to avoid.

However, we have already used T and it is present, so if we put T in another position, we would get feedback about that. But for now, we are trying to find the word, so we can consider words with T in other positions? But let's first try without duplicating T.

So back to the pattern: _ _ I T _

We need a word that has the third letter I and fourth letter T.

Let me list some words that fit:
- ""UNITY"" -> U-N-I-T-Y -> positions: 1:U, 2:N, 3:I, 4:T, 5:Y -> fits. And U, N, Y are not absent. So valid.
- ""DAINTY"": too long -> 6 letters.
- ""DITTO"": D-I-T-T-O -> but pattern: D at 1, I at 2 (but we need I at 3) -> doesn't fit.
- ""BITTY"": B-I-T-T-Y -> I at position 2 -> no.
- ""PITHY"": P-I-T-H-Y -> I at 2 -> no.
- ""WITTY"": W-I-T-T-Y -> I at 2 -> no.
- ""KITTY"": K-I-T-T-Y -> I at 2 -> no.
- ""MITTS"": M is absent -> invalid, and also I at 2? 
- ""DUTY"": only 4 letters.

Another word: ""UNFIT"": U-N-F-I-T -> pattern: U-N-F-I-T -> positions: 1:U, 2:N, 3:F, 4:I, 5:T -> but we need I at 3 and T at 4, but here I is at 4 and T at 5 -> no.

We need the I at position 3 and T at position 4.

Another: ""UNLIT"": U-N-L-I-T -> positions: 1:U, 2:N, 3:L, 4:I, 5:T -> again, I at 4 -> no.

""SPLIT"": S is absent -> invalid.

""ADMIT"": A and M absent -> invalid.

""LIMIT"": L-I-M-I-T -> M is absent, and also I at 2 -> pattern doesn't match.

""TOXIC"": T at start? T-O-X-I-C -> I at 4? But we need I at 3 and T at 4. Here T at 1 and I at 4 -> no.

""LOGIC"": L-O-G-I-C -> I at 4 -> no.

""TOPIC"": T-O-P-I-C -> I at 4 -> no.

""JUICY"": J-U-I-C-Y -> I at 3, but then the next is C (absent) and then Y. But we need T at position 4? We have I at 3, then C at 4 -> no T at 4.

We must have T at position 4.

Another idea: ""UNITE"" is invalid because of E. What about ""UNTIL""? U-N-T-I-L -> pattern: U-N-T-I-L -> positions: 1:U, 2:N, 3:T, 4:I, 5:L -> but we need I at 3 and T at 4, but here T is at 3 and I at 4 -> no.

""OFTEN"": O-F-T-E-N -> E absent -> invalid, and pattern: T at 3 -> no.

""AFTER"": A and E absent -> invalid.

""ENTER"": E and E? E absent -> invalid.

""ULTRA"": U-L-T-R-A -> A absent -> invalid.

""ULTIMATE"": too long.

We are having trouble. Let me think of words that end with ""IT"" and then a letter? Actually, the word must have ""IT"" as the third and fourth letters, so the word is: [letter][letter]IT[letter]

So the last part is ""IT"" and then one letter at the end. So the word ends with ""IT"" plus one letter? Actually, no: the word is of the form: ABITC, meaning:
- A: first letter
- B: second letter
- I: third letter
- T: fourth letter
- C: fifth letter

So the word is: ??IT?

We can search for words that have the substring ""IT"" starting at the third position? So the word is: xxITx

Examples:
- ""orbit"": O-R-B-I-T -> but R is absent, and also the pattern: O at 1, R at 2, B at 3? No, B is at 3? We need I at 3 and T at 4. Here: position 3 is B, 4 is I, 5 is T -> no.
- ""habit"": H is absent -> invalid.
- ""debit"": D-E-B-I-T -> E absent -> invalid.
- ""audit"": A and U? A absent -> invalid.
- ""edith"": E and H absent -> invalid.
- ""merit"": M and E absent -> invalid.
- ""posit"": P-O-S-I-T -> S absent -> invalid.
- ""visit"": S absent -> invalid.
- ""fruit"": F-R-U-I-T -> R absent -> invalid.
- ""bruit"": B-R-U-I-T -> R absent -> invalid.
- ""guitar"": too long.

Another word: ""unzip"": U-N-Z-I-P -> pattern: U at 1, N at 2, Z at 3? But we need I at 3 -> no, I is at 4? Positions: 1:U, 2:N, 3:Z, 4:I, 5:P -> no.

We need the third letter to be I and fourth to be T.

Let me try: ""twist"": T-W-I-S-T -> S absent -> invalid, and also T at 1 and 5? But pattern: T at 1, W at 2, I at 3, S at 4, T at 5 -> we have T at 1 and 5, but we need T at 4? Here T is at 1 and 5, and S at 4 -> no.

""exist"": E and S absent -> invalid.

""paint"": P-A-I-N-T -> A absent -> invalid.

""faint"": F-A-I-N-T -> A absent -> invalid.

""joint"": J-O-I-N-T -> pattern: J at 1, O at 2, I at 3, N at 4, T at 5 -> but we need T at position 4, but here it's at 5 -> no.

Wait, no: in ""joint"", the fourth letter is N and fifth is T. We need the fourth letter to be T.

So we need the fourth letter to be T, so the word must have the letter T in the fourth position and the third letter must be I.

So the word is: [letter][letter] I T [letter]

We have ""UNITY"" as a candidate: U-N-I-T-Y -> positions: 1:U, 2:N, 3:I, 4:T, 5:Y -> perfect.

Are there others?
- ""DITTY"": D-I-T-T-Y -> but I is at position 2, not 3 -> no.
- ""PITON"": P-I-T-O-N -> I at 2 -> no.
- ""MITRE"": M absent and E absent -> invalid.
- ""NITRO"": N-I-T-R-O -> I at 2 -> no.
- ""LITRE"": L-I-T-R-E -> I at 2, and R and E absent -> invalid.
- ""TITAN"": T-I-T-A-N -> I at 2, A absent -> invalid.
- ""VITAL"": V-I-T-A-L -> I at 2, A absent -> invalid.

What about ""BILLY"": B-I-L-L-Y -> I at 2 -> no.

""WILLY"": W-I-L-L-Y -> I at 2 -> no.

""KITTY"": K-I-T-T-Y -> I at 2 -> no.

""BITTY"": same.

""PITHY"": P-I-T-H-Y -> I at 2 -> no.

""WITHY"": W-I-T-H-Y -> I at 2 -> no.

""JITNEY"": too long.

""UNITY"" seems to be a good candidate.

Another possibility: ""QUITS"": Q-U-I-T-S -> but S absent -> invalid.

""QUIET"": E absent -> invalid.

""QUITE"": E absent -> invalid.

""SUITE"": S and E absent -> invalid.

""UNTIE"": U-N-T-I-E -> E absent -> invalid.

""UNITE"": same.

""UNLIT"": U-N-L-I-T -> pattern: U at 1, N at 2, L at 3, I at 4, T at 5 -> but we need I at 3 and T at 4 -> no.

So ""UNITY"" is a valid word that fits the pattern and avoids all absent letters.

But let's confirm the absent letters: we have C, R, A, E, S, M, H absent. U, N, Y are not in that list.

Therefore, we can guess ""UNITY"".

But note: we haven't tested O, L, D, P, B, G, etc. But we are trying to solve the puzzle, so we can use ""UNITY"".

Alternatively, we could try a word that tests more new letters, but ""UNITY"" tests U, N, Y which are new.

Another word: ""DAISY"" -> but no T? Doesn't fit pattern.

""PITHY"" doesn't fit.

So I think ""UNITY"" is a good guess.

But wait, what about ""DUTY""? It's only 4 letters.

Or ""DITTO"" doesn't fit.

Another word: ""BIGHT"" -> B-I-G-H-T -> H absent -> invalid.

""LIGHT"" -> H absent -> invalid.

""FIGHT"" -> H absent -> invalid.

""RIGHT"" -> H absent -> invalid.

""WIGHT"" -> H absent -> invalid.

""TIGHT"" -> T-I-G-H-T -> H absent -> invalid.

So no.

""BIRTH"": B-I-R-T-H -> R and H absent -> invalid.

""DIRTY"": D-I-R-T-Y -> R absent -> invalid.

""DIRGE"": R and E absent -> invalid.

So I think ""UNITY"" is the best candidate.

Therefore, we guess ""UNITY"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crate"" → C(x), R(x), A(x), T(✓), E(x)**  
  This means:  
  - T is in the word and correctly placed at position 4.  
  - C, R, A, E are **not** in the word.  

- **Guess 2: ""smith"" → S(x), M(x), I(✓), T(✓), H(x)**  
  This means:  
  - I is in the word and correctly placed at position 3.  
  - T is confirmed at position 4 (as in Guess 1).  
  - S, M, H are **not** in the word.  

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ _ I T _` (I at position 3, T at position 4).  
- **Absent letters (cannot be used)**: C, R, A, E, S, M, H.  
- **Present letters**: I and T (both position-locked).  
- We need to test new high-frequency letters (e.g., O, U, N, L, D, P, B, G, Y) to maximize information.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Must fit the pattern `_ _ I T _`** and avoid all absent letters.  
- Prioritize words with common untested letters (e.g., U, N, O, L, D) to cover more possibilities.  
- Avoid repeating letters unless necessary (no duplicates in this guess).  

After evaluating valid 5-letter words, **""UNITY""** is the best choice:  
- **Pattern fit**: `U N I T Y` → Positions: 1=U, 2=N, 3=I (✓), 4=T (✓), 5=Y.  
- **Tests new letters**: U, N, Y (all high-frequency and untested).  
- **Avoids absent letters**: No C, R, A, E, S, M, H.  
- **Word validity**: ""UNITY"" is a common English word (meaning harmony or oneness).  

This guess efficiently narrows down the solution space by testing three new letters while leveraging known positions. If ""UNITY"" is incorrect, the feedback will reveal the status of U, N, and Y, bringing us closer to the solution.

<guess>unity</guess>",unity,"We are given feedback from two previous guesses:

Guess 1: ""crate"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), T(✓), E(x)
This means:
- T is correct and in the correct position (position 4).
- C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: ""smith"" -> S(x), M(x), I(✓), T(✓), H(x)
This means:
- I is correct and in the correct position (position 3? because in ""smith"", I is the third letter).
- T is again confirmed correct and in position 4 (which we already knew).
- S, M, H are not in the word.

Note: The positions matter. In ""smith"":
  Position 1: S -> absent (x)
  Position 2: M -> absent (x)
  Position 3: I -> correct (✓)
  Position 4: T -> correct (✓)
  Position 5: H -> absent (x)

So from the feedback, we know:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ _ I T _ 
  (because I is in position 3 and T in position 4).

Additionally, the following letters are absent: C, R, A, E, S, M, H.

We have used 8 distinct letters: C, R, A, T, E, S, M, I, H. But note T and I are present, so we must avoid the absent ones.

We need to make a new 5-letter word that:
- Has the pattern: _ _ I T _
- Does not contain any of the absent letters: C, R, A, E, S, M, H.
- Must be a valid English word.

We also know that the first two letters must be letters that we haven't tried yet (or that are not in the absent list) and the last letter must be a letter not in the absent list.

We can think of common letters that are still available. The most common letters in English that we haven't tried include: O, U, L, N, D, P, B, G, Y, etc.

We need to form a word that fits _ _ I T _

Let's list some words that fit the pattern and avoid the absent letters:

Possible words:
- The word must end with ""IT"" in the third and fourth positions, so the last part is ""IT"" and then one more letter at the end.

Examples:
- ...IT? -> the last letter can be various.

Common words:
- ""LIGHT"": but H is absent -> invalid.
- ""TIGHT"": T at the start? But we have T at position 4, and we don't know about the first letter. However, note that T is already in the word (at position 4) and we don't know if it can appear again? The rules don't say the word cannot have duplicate letters, but in this case, we don't have any duplicate so far. Also, ""TIGHT"" has two T's? Actually, ""TIGHT"" is T-I-G-H-T -> positions: T at 1 and 5, and we have I at 2? But our pattern requires I at position 3 and T at 4. So ""TIGHT"" doesn't fit the pattern.

We need the pattern: letter1, letter2, I, T, letter5.

So the word is: [letter1][letter2] I T [letter5]

We must avoid: C, R, A, E, S, M, H.

Let's try to think of words that end with ""IT"" and then one letter? Actually, the ""IT"" is in the middle, so the word is XXITX.

Some possibilities:
- ""UNITE"": U-N-I-T-E -> but E is absent (from first guess) -> invalid.
- ""UNITY"": U-N-I-T-Y -> letters: U, N, I, T, Y. 
  - Check absent: U, N, Y are not in the absent list. I and T are present. So valid.
- ""POINT"": P-O-I-N-T -> pattern: P-O-I-N-T -> positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:I, 4:T? Wait, no: the fourth letter is N, and fifth is T. So the T is at position 5, not 4. Doesn't fit pattern (we need T at position 4).
- ""JOINT"": same issue, T at the end.
- ""FLINT"": F-L-I-N-T -> again, T at the end (position 5) and N at position 4 -> doesn't fit.
- ""BUILT"": B-U-I-L-T -> pattern: B-U-I-L-T -> positions: 1:B, 2:U, 3:I, 4:L, 5:T -> but we need position 4 to be T, but here it's L. So no.
- ""QUIT"": only 4 letters -> too short.
- ""QUIET"": Q-U-I-E-T -> but E is absent -> invalid.
- ""QUITE"": Q-U-I-T-E -> E is absent -> invalid.
- ""SUITE"": S and E absent -> invalid.
- ""WAIST"": W-A-I-S-T -> A and S are absent -> invalid.
- ""EXIST"": E and S absent -> invalid.
- ""TOWIT"": not common, and T at start? Also, we have T at position 4, but if we use T at start, that's allowed? But we don't know if T can be duplicated. However, we haven't been told that T is duplicated, so we should avoid duplicates unless necessary? But the rules don't forbid duplicates. However, in the feedback for ""smith"", we had T at position 4 and we don't have any indication of another T. But we can't assume. However, to be safe, we might avoid T in other positions until we have evidence of duplicates.

But note: the feedback for ""crate"" had T as correct at position 4, and then in ""smith"" we again had T at position 4 as correct. That doesn't tell us about other T's. So we cannot rule out having another T.

But in the pattern, we are only required to have T at position 4. The other positions can be any letter (including T) unless we have a reason to avoid.

However, we have already used T and it is present, so if we put T in another position, we would get feedback about that. But for now, we are trying to find the word, so we can consider words with T in other positions? But let's first try without duplicating T.

So back to the pattern: _ _ I T _

We need a word that has the third letter I and fourth letter T.

Let me list some words that fit:
- ""UNITY"" -> U-N-I-T-Y -> positions: 1:U, 2:N, 3:I, 4:T, 5:Y -> fits. And U, N, Y are not absent. So valid.
- ""DAINTY"": too long -> 6 letters.
- ""DITTO"": D-I-T-T-O -> but pattern: D at 1, I at 2 (but we need I at 3) -> doesn't fit.
- ""BITTY"": B-I-T-T-Y -> I at position 2 -> no.
- ""PITHY"": P-I-T-H-Y -> I at 2 -> no.
- ""WITTY"": W-I-T-T-Y -> I at 2 -> no.
- ""KITTY"": K-I-T-T-Y -> I at 2 -> no.
- ""MITTS"": M is absent -> invalid, and also I at 2? 
- ""DUTY"": only 4 letters.

Another word: ""UNFIT"": U-N-F-I-T -> pattern: U-N-F-I-T -> positions: 1:U, 2:N, 3:F, 4:I, 5:T -> but we need I at 3 and T at 4, but here I is at 4 and T at 5 -> no.

We need the I at position 3 and T at position 4.

Another: ""UNLIT"": U-N-L-I-T -> positions: 1:U, 2:N, 3:L, 4:I, 5:T -> again, I at 4 -> no.

""SPLIT"": S is absent -> invalid.

""ADMIT"": A and M absent -> invalid.

""LIMIT"": L-I-M-I-T -> M is absent, and also I at 2 -> pattern doesn't match.

""TOXIC"": T at start? T-O-X-I-C -> I at 4? But we need I at 3 and T at 4. Here T at 1 and I at 4 -> no.

""LOGIC"": L-O-G-I-C -> I at 4 -> no.

""TOPIC"": T-O-P-I-C -> I at 4 -> no.

""JUICY"": J-U-I-C-Y -> I at 3, but then the next is C (absent) and then Y. But we need T at position 4? We have I at 3, then C at 4 -> no T at 4.

We must have T at position 4.

Another idea: ""UNITE"" is invalid because of E. What about ""UNTIL""? U-N-T-I-L -> pattern: U-N-T-I-L -> positions: 1:U, 2:N, 3:T, 4:I, 5:L -> but we need I at 3 and T at 4, but here T is at 3 and I at 4 -> no.

""OFTEN"": O-F-T-E-N -> E absent -> invalid, and pattern: T at 3 -> no.

""AFTER"": A and E absent -> invalid.

""ENTER"": E and E? E absent -> invalid.

""ULTRA"": U-L-T-R-A -> A absent -> invalid.

""ULTIMATE"": too long.

We are having trouble. Let me think of words that end with ""IT"" and then a letter? Actually, the word must have ""IT"" as the third and fourth letters, so the word is: [letter][letter]IT[letter]

So the last part is ""IT"" and then one letter at the end. So the word ends with ""IT"" plus one letter? Actually, no: the word is of the form: ABITC, meaning:
- A: first letter
- B: second letter
- I: third letter
- T: fourth letter
- C: fifth letter

So the word is: ??IT?

We can search for words that have the substring ""IT"" starting at the third position? So the word is: xxITx

Examples:
- ""orbit"": O-R-B-I-T -> but R is absent, and also the pattern: O at 1, R at 2, B at 3? No, B is at 3? We need I at 3 and T at 4. Here: position 3 is B, 4 is I, 5 is T -> no.
- ""habit"": H is absent -> invalid.
- ""debit"": D-E-B-I-T -> E absent -> invalid.
- ""audit"": A and U? A absent -> invalid.
- ""edith"": E and H absent -> invalid.
- ""merit"": M and E absent -> invalid.
- ""posit"": P-O-S-I-T -> S absent -> invalid.
- ""visit"": S absent -> invalid.
- ""fruit"": F-R-U-I-T -> R absent -> invalid.
- ""bruit"": B-R-U-I-T -> R absent -> invalid.
- ""guitar"": too long.

Another word: ""unzip"": U-N-Z-I-P -> pattern: U at 1, N at 2, Z at 3? But we need I at 3 -> no, I is at 4? Positions: 1:U, 2:N, 3:Z, 4:I, 5:P -> no.

We need the third letter to be I and fourth to be T.

Let me try: ""twist"": T-W-I-S-T -> S absent -> invalid, and also T at 1 and 5? But pattern: T at 1, W at 2, I at 3, S at 4, T at 5 -> we have T at 1 and 5, but we need T at 4? Here T is at 1 and 5, and S at 4 -> no.

""exist"": E and S absent -> invalid.

""paint"": P-A-I-N-T -> A absent -> invalid.

""faint"": F-A-I-N-T -> A absent -> invalid.

""joint"": J-O-I-N-T -> pattern: J at 1, O at 2, I at 3, N at 4, T at 5 -> but we need T at position 4, but here it's at 5 -> no.

Wait, no: in ""joint"", the fourth letter is N and fifth is T. We need the fourth letter to be T.

So we need the fourth letter to be T, so the word must have the letter T in the fourth position and the third letter must be I.

So the word is: [letter][letter] I T [letter]

We have ""UNITY"" as a candidate: U-N-I-T-Y -> positions: 1:U, 2:N, 3:I, 4:T, 5:Y -> perfect.

Are there others?
- ""DITTY"": D-I-T-T-Y -> but I is at position 2, not 3 -> no.
- ""PITON"": P-I-T-O-N -> I at 2 -> no.
- ""MITRE"": M absent and E absent -> invalid.
- ""NITRO"": N-I-T-R-O -> I at 2 -> no.
- ""LITRE"": L-I-T-R-E -> I at 2, and R and E absent -> invalid.
- ""TITAN"": T-I-T-A-N -> I at 2, A absent -> invalid.
- ""VITAL"": V-I-T-A-L -> I at 2, A absent -> invalid.

What about ""BILLY"": B-I-L-L-Y -> I at 2 -> no.

""WILLY"": W-I-L-L-Y -> I at 2 -> no.

""KITTY"": K-I-T-T-Y -> I at 2 -> no.

""BITTY"": same.

""PITHY"": P-I-T-H-Y -> I at 2 -> no.

""WITHY"": W-I-T-H-Y -> I at 2 -> no.

""JITNEY"": too long.

""UNITY"" seems to be a good candidate.

Another possibility: ""QUITS"": Q-U-I-T-S -> but S absent -> invalid.

""QUIET"": E absent -> invalid.

""QUITE"": E absent -> invalid.

""SUITE"": S and E absent -> invalid.

""UNTIE"": U-N-T-I-E -> E absent -> invalid.

""UNITE"": same.

""UNLIT"": U-N-L-I-T -> pattern: U at 1, N at 2, L at 3, I at 4, T at 5 -> but we need I at 3 and T at 4 -> no.

So ""UNITY"" is a valid word that fits the pattern and avoids all absent letters.

But let's confirm the absent letters: we have C, R, A, E, S, M, H absent. U, N, Y are not in that list.

Therefore, we can guess ""UNITY"".

But note: we haven't tested O, L, D, P, B, G, etc. But we are trying to solve the puzzle, so we can use ""UNITY"".

Alternatively, we could try a word that tests more new letters, but ""UNITY"" tests U, N, Y which are new.

Another word: ""DAISY"" -> but no T? Doesn't fit pattern.

""PITHY"" doesn't fit.

So I think ""UNITY"" is a good guess.

But wait, what about ""DUTY""? It's only 4 letters.

Or ""DITTO"" doesn't fit.

Another word: ""BIGHT"" -> B-I-G-H-T -> H absent -> invalid.

""LIGHT"" -> H absent -> invalid.

""FIGHT"" -> H absent -> invalid.

""RIGHT"" -> H absent -> invalid.

""WIGHT"" -> H absent -> invalid.

""TIGHT"" -> T-I-G-H-T -> H absent -> invalid.

So no.

""BIRTH"": B-I-R-T-H -> R and H absent -> invalid.

""DIRTY"": D-I-R-T-Y -> R absent -> invalid.

""DIRGE"": R and E absent -> invalid.

So I think ""UNITY"" is the best candidate.

Therefore, we guess ""UNITY"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crate"" → C(x), R(x), A(x), T(✓), E(x)**  
  This means:  
  - T is in the word and correctly placed at position 4.  
  - C, R, A, E are **not** in the word.  

- **Guess 2: ""smith"" → S(x), M(x), I(✓), T(✓), H(x)**  
  This means:  
  - I is in the word and correctly placed at position 3.  
  - T is confirmed at position 4 (as in Guess 1).  
  - S, M, H are **not** in the word.  

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ _ I T _` (I at position 3, T at position 4).  
- **Absent letters (cannot be used)**: C, R, A, E, S, M, H.  
- **Present letters**: I and T (both position-locked).  
- We need to test new high-frequency letters (e.g., O, U, N, L, D, P, B, G, Y) to maximize information.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Must fit the pattern `_ _ I T _`** and avoid all absent letters.  
- Prioritize words with common untested letters (e.g., U, N, O, L, D) to cover more possibilities.  
- Avoid repeating letters unless necessary (no duplicates in this guess).  

After evaluating valid 5-letter words, **""UNITY""** is the best choice:  
- **Pattern fit**: `U N I T Y` → Positions: 1=U, 2=N, 3=I (✓), 4=T (✓), 5=Y.  
- **Tests new letters**: U, N, Y (all high-frequency and untested).  
- **Avoids absent letters**: No C, R, A, E, S, M, H.  
- **Word validity**: ""UNITY"" is a common English word (meaning harmony or oneness).  

This guess efficiently narrows down the solution space by testing three new letters while leveraging known positions. If ""UNITY"" is incorrect, the feedback will reveal the status of U, N, and Y, bringing us closer to the solution.",Guess 3: unity -> FEEDBACK: U(✓) N(✓) I(✓) T(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
